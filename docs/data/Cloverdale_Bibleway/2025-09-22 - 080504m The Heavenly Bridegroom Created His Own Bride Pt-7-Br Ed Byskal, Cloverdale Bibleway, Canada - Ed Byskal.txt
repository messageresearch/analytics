We want to remember brother Ricardo Gonzalez this morning and his father's family. Uh Ricardo's sister passed away this uh father's sister passed away this morning. So we just want to uplift the family as I believe brother Ricardo and Buffy will probably be with the family this morning. So we just want to uplift them. If you have a need on on your heart, just raise it as we would a prayer. Brother John, if you would come. [Music] Hallelujah Jesus. Thank you Jesus. We just want to worship you for a moment, God. Seeking shepherd, God, you found us. So lost, so undone on our road to hell. Caught in the thicket somewhere, God, you found us. Lord, we just want to take a little time to give you glory this morning. Open up these mouths of ours. Open up these hearts of ours. We were undone. We were broken. &gt;&gt; We were shattered. &gt;&gt; We were in despair. &gt;&gt; We were in the shadows. We were sick. [Music] &gt;&gt; Something somewhere came by our way this morning. We're worshippers, Lord. &gt;&gt; We just want to lift up these hands of ours, these hearts of ours. &gt;&gt; Say, "Thank you, Jesus. It's still amazing after all these years to think that you had come to the likes of us, &gt;&gt; Jesus, God. And give us another chance, another opportunity, even to live in this life and victory, but then to promise us eternal life and a land beyond the river and a future home. And &gt;&gt; it goes beyond our minds, Lord. We don't even know how to think, Lord, when it comes to these things. Lord, we're in need of healing this morning, Jesus. Hands are lifted up. There's burdens on our hearts, unspoken requests, burdens. Lord, we're approaching you as our father, our God, the only true living God. We sing about you. We hear about you. Lord, we're mindful of everyone that's here. Lord, they've come from all over the globe. from India, Africa, China, Vietnam, Europe, North America, Australia. We've come to worship you, God. We are here for a thirst. We have a hunger for you. See your glory, Lord. See you in our mothers, see you in our fathers, see you in our children, see you in the brother next to us, the sister next to us. to see your glory manifested in our flesh. Lord, &gt;&gt; you are our healer. &gt;&gt; You are our savior. &gt;&gt; You're the miracle worker, God. You're the provider, Lord. &gt;&gt; Lord, you're able to do what we cannot do. And you've done that in the past. And we're here this morning as believers because we love you. This isn't just a church or a gathering. We're not just going to hear words of a sermon. We're not just hearing music. We're in your presence. Lord, your atmosphere is here. The theophanes are in this building. Lord, your your angels have been dispatched to this place. They love this presence. We love this presence. We want to get out of the way this morning, God. If there's sin among us, we want to deal with it right now. forgive us of our sins. We're putting our hands upon the lamb of God. The quivering lamb of Calvary. Calvary was sufficient for our sins, for the sins of the world. You are so great and so mighty. You're able this morning to go to the deepest hearts, the deepest hell or the lowest valley. And Lord, I pray that you would go to those places. Lord, hands are lifted up. Our hearts are lifted up. We want to see you, Lord, manifested in issues and lives and situations. And we just come humbly, Lord, asking you to go with Brother Ricardo and his wife and his family, those that'll be gathered for this season. There's loved ones. There's unspoken requests that are here. God, would you be our strength, Lord? Would you be our salvation? We're looking to you, Lord, to win our hearts, to heal lands, to restore, Lord, all the years. Only you are able to do the supernatural, God. But we believe we're in the presence of a supernatural, God. So come down this morning and consume every sacrifice. Affect us, God, eternally. Impact our lives, Lord, not just on the emotion or on the body, but in our souls. create Lord this morning from your very heart what needs to take place. And we're all praying according to your will be done. Come down in this meeting and take our pastor, use his gift, Lord, that you've placed in his life. Once more, Lord, would you just breathe across the keys of our souls and our lives, Lord? Someone would be sick among us that you would just come by their way this morning. Maybe today is the day that the angel would visit their address, God. You can do anything, Lord. Nothing is too hard for you. And we release our faith and pray throughout this service, God, that you would release more faith to our lives, revelation, and hearts and and minds and thoughts that are from that other dimension. that it would just drop down into this place that demon spirits would lose their grip. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Things that are undone, things that are in the darkness, that you would bring them to the surface. And may the light of God shine, Lord, in areas that only you, God, can do, Lord. Lord Jesus, we're in your presence now. May you just speak to our lives, speak to our hearts. We want to see you moving, Lord, in our lives, in this meeting, God, from the front to the back, in the on the internet, Lord, on the phone hookup, in the nursery, in the fellowship hall. Lord, we're here. We're waiting to hear your voice, God. We love you this morning, Jesus. &gt;&gt; Come by this way again, &gt;&gt; and we'll respond appropriately, God. take our lives and consume us with your spirit and by your fire, God, take us away into that other dimension where all things are possible. Lord, &gt;&gt; we worship you, Jesus. And we thank you already for what you're doing, what you're going to do, what you've done, Lord. &gt;&gt; In Jesus name. &gt;&gt; Amen. [Music] You may have your seats. [Music] Amen. God bless you. It's good to have everyone here this morning. If you're on the internet hookup or the telephone hookup, we want to say God bless you. It's It's really good to have you here with us. Amen. I know Wednesday I I looked down and saw Micah Deavea. It's good to have our brother Micah back with us. He's out on the field with brother Tony.

Heat. We love your name. [Music] Heat. Heat. Oh, [Music] [Music] heat, heat. [Music] [Music] Heat. [Music] Heat. [Music] We walk by faith and not by sight. Our eyes look to the unseen, the Lord Jesus Christ. For he has promised that we will reign with him. But the pathway to glory is through suffering. So count it all joy when you fall in diverse temptations for it's only to bring you to that perfect place. Although we are tested and we are dry yet in the midst of it all. We get a piece of mind for the trying of our faith work and patience. [Music] in my lowest valley. He restoreth my soul and he gives me strength to keep pressing on. [Music] Sometimes we pray, "Oh Lord, please take my life. I just can't go on. I don't know what to do." But in that hour, we find our juniper tree where the angel comes to strengthen for the journey ahead. For in our weakness his strength is made perfect and his grace is sufficient for us. We are testing and we are trying yet in the midst of it all. We get a piece of mind for the tri of our faith. working for in my lowest valley. He restores my soul and he gives me strength to keep pressing on. In the midst of it all, we get a peace of mind for the tri of our faith work. In my lowest valley, he restores my soul and he gives me strength to keep pressing on. For though we are testing it all and we are trying the midst of we can have peace of mind every day. The tri of our faith and the my restore my soul and he gives me strength to keep pressing on. Although we are testing and we are trying [Applause] [Music] we get a piece of mind for the trying of our faith work [Music] restoring my soul And he gives me strength when I'm down in the valley. He gives me strength &gt;&gt; in the midst of my trial. He gives me strength. I'm pressing on. He gives me strength to keep pressing on. Oh, in my lowest valley he restore in my soul. [Music] And he gives me strength to keep pressing on. Yes, he gives me strength to keep pressing on. [Music] [Applause] Amen. Thank you, choir. Definitely gives us strength to keep pressing on. I know brother Derek and his wife Debbie are going to have their baby dedicated if they want to come and get ready at this time. Brother Derek was telling me in the back study he says the choir is going to be singing this song. The reason I'm having him sing this song is because this is the exact song that's kept us through this little trial we're having with our little baby and song that came to my heart by the Derek is I believe God I know you kind of you said last last week you said when I come up here next Sunday I'm going to have a testimony. Well the song I want to sing next is he's already provided. &gt;&gt; Amen. We're going to believe as a church that God's going to meet brother Derek Sister Debbiey's need this morning. Amen. So as they come and get ready for baby dedication, let's sing. He's already proided. He's already proided. Oh, everything he's already provided. [Music] Every pro you can make just as he is everything you need. He's already provided [Music] and provided abundantly. Amen. &gt;&gt; We see that our brother Derek and sister Debbie are being provided for abundantly in many ways with this uh latest edition which is David Alexander and Sister Debbiey's mother and father are here also. her sister Brittany, her mother and father Terry and Joanne Savory. I wonder if they could just stand and we'd like to recognize them as well. Here they are here. For those of this congregation, we've been praying for David and uh for his physical need. The Bible says that they brought young children to him that he should touch them. That's about as far as I got. Brother David, I mean, Brother Derek, for David, I uh actually I want to tell you, Brother Derek, Sister Debbie, I really sense the presence of God as I waited on the Lord just in the study. Now generally I have uh families they inform me on Saturday that who's coming and everything is on and brother Derek because he's a very you know uh he does things all you know by the book and so he let me know two weeks ago and that's a good thing but that's not good enough. I I I need to be reminded. But it was actually good. It was actually good. I had so much on my mind with the studies and now this morning I I said I like being honest with the congregation, you know. So I said to have the baby dedication. I thought I said, "Who's taking it, Brother Derek?" He said, "I don't know. I told you about it two weeks ago." So that really allowed me to focus and I just went to the Lord and I I I got to that particular line and they brought the children that he would touch them and then just begin to Holy Spirit just begin to deal with me. We're here not to only dedicate the child, but to dedicate the to dedicate in the scripture also means to consecrate. And to consecrate in the scripture means to to complete, to bring to a completion, to bring to perfection. And this little one here is going through many tests every day, blood tests every day, medication every few hours. And I said, "Oh, God. We're going to dedicate. We're bringing Sister Debbie and Brother Derek are bringing this child and it needs a lot more than my touch." And I'm praying that the great high priest will come now and touch him as we dedicate him and consecrate him because consecrate is to not only to separate it but to bring him to completion and I pray that he will be brought to a physical completion but my prayer is going to go far beyond that. I'm going to pray that God will bring him also as he matures and grows to a spiritual completion. &gt;&gt; And may he hear things that other children don't hear. May he hear a voice that maybe others don't hear. May he see things that others don't see. When Jesus said, "The world won't see me, but you'll see me." May he see him according to the words of Jesus. May he hear him. May he now feel his touch. And that is what I'm going to be praying in this dedication. And may you join your heart with me as we dedicate David Alexander to the Lord Jesus Christ. And his he shall be. And I pray that the great shepherd will lead him and that he'll have a great appetite for spiritual things and the Lord will feed him. All of his spiritual and physical senses will be met and fully satisfied in the presence of Jehovah. He has provided. Amen. Praise God. Dear heavenly father, as we hold this gem, this jewel of life that you have given to our brother Derek and sister Debbie and to this extended family, I pray, Father, as I lay my hands upon him and hold him and embrace him in yourstead. I'm a poor substitute. But I pray, Father, that you will see me now and I I dedicate him to you and consecrate him to you that you might complete the work, the healing work in his body. Deliver him from this infirmity in the name of Jesus Christ. Let him be raised to be a healthy, normal, strong boy. May the chemistry in this system now be corrected. Father, in the name of Jesus Christ, let it baffle, oh God, even the medical people. Lord, let him be a real testimony for you. And as he grows and matures, I pray that this touch will extend beyond his physical being to his spiritual being. May he see the things, Lord, as I have waited on you, and ask that he will see the things that others may not see around him, other children. Give him an appetite, oh God, for spiritual things. Let him hear the voice of the master calling him, calling his name. David Alexander, you're mine. I have I have lent him I have lent him to this family for a short time, but he he is mine. Lord, I dedicate David Alexander to you in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ. And I pray that his parents, brother Derek and sister Debbie, will be given divine wisdom to raise him, to provide for him. And to give him, oh God, all that is needed to nurture him up in the admonition and fear of the Lord in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ. Amen. Hallelujah. Bless you, brother Derek. Bless you, man. Bless you. Three girls and the family's got to be okay. Amen. I'll have you stand with me and I want to tell the congregation because we prayed in the last service for another little child 6 months old, the cowen baby that had a tumor, cancerous tumor the size of a grapefruit in its body and it was laying in the Seattle Children's Hospital and uh I just spoke to the congregation because we had met the greatgrandfather uh Mr. Cen who is the uh he's the founder of Cen Sand and Gravel and Concrete. They've been very generous to us for the camp. Mr. Cen, the senior came to the camp. I believe it was Friday and was speaking to brother Jack Aguary and brother Chris and uh they suggested that he they they phoned and suggested that we speak together. I was speaking with Mr. Leonard Cen. He's the greatgrandfather. Told me that the doctors had operated and found no cancer in the body. &gt;&gt; Amen. Hallelujah. [Music] Praise God. I believe they did remove the tumor, but they said something to the effect that the cancer had stopped &gt;&gt; and did not go any further in the body. Isn't that wonderful? Isn't our Lord wonderful? Amen. And that's why I was touched when we began to pray for brother Derek and Sister Debbiey's baby. Excuse me. I'd like to just sing a a chorus of a song and I hope we have it on the screen. For he knew me yet he loved me. He whose glory makes the heaven shine. Can you help me with that please? For he knew me. He love me. He's glory. The heaven shine. I was so worthy. mercy. [Music] And when he was on cross, I was on his fore. [Music] Heat. Heat. [Music] I'm sorry. [Music] He was on the cross. I was on his mind. Yet while he was on his cross, I was on his once again. is &gt;&gt; just before we go to the word, I'm going to ask brother Tom Ray if he'll come and ask God's blessing upon the preaching and upon the word this morning. [Music] Hallelujah. [Music] This is the grace of God, Lord. [Music] Just such such mercy. Lord, how we've been dwelling on this thought that in my own life, Lord, how I found myself in your mind. It's marvelous, Lord. Hanging between [Music] heaven and earth, hanging as my redeemer, my savior, my substitute, my lamb. I was on your mind, Lord. This is a great thought. And so Lord, you've got us in your mind this morning. Bleeding lamb, come forth. &gt;&gt; Anoint your servant. Lord, anoint. Let that word have its way within our souls this morning. [Music] Anoint your servant. Anoint our ears to hear and move upon us, Lord, that we can say, "You're my redeemer. You're my savior. You're my all and all. So Lord, we commit this service asking thy will be done. &gt;&gt; Meet our every need. In Jesus name we pray. Amen. [Music] I'll invite you to open your Bible to the book of Romans, 8th chapter. We're going to begin reading at verse 26. Very, very common scripture. I'm sure some of this you quote frequently by heart. Starting at the 26th verse. Likewise, the Spirit also helpeth our infirmities. For we know not what we should pray for, as we ought, but the Spirit itself maketh intercession for us with groanings which cannot be uttered. And he that searchth the hearts knoweth what is the mind of the Spirit, because he maketh intercession for the saints according to the will of God. And we know that all things work together for good to them that love God and to them who are the called according to his purpose. For whom he did forno, he also did predestinate to be conformed to the image of his son that he might be the firstborn among many brethren. Moreover, whom he did predestinate them he also called. And whom he called, them he also justified. And whom he justified, them he also glorified. What shall we say then to these things? If God be before us, who can be against us? &gt;&gt; Isn't that marvelous? &gt;&gt; The God spoke through the prophet Isaiah and he said these words. You don't need to turn to it. Just a few line, a few words rather in Isaiah 43:21. This people have I formed for myself. &gt;&gt; They shall show forth my praise. &gt;&gt; Isn't that marvelous? &gt;&gt; This people have I formed for myself. I've been preaching for six weeks now, the seventh time on the heavenly bridegroom has created or created his own bride. He made her, formed her, &gt;&gt; created her. There's all kinds of words that we could use in a descriptive way to say that God has created a people. And I took so much time on describing perhaps millions of years that was in God's mind, unfolding it down. And here we are. Here we are. We're here to be uh we're been formed by God. Where we find ourselves right now is God's doing. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You agree with that? &gt;&gt; God bless you as you have your seat. the the environment of our homes or the environment of where you live uh your upbringing perhaps the country you came from or the part of the country you came from there's a quite a vast difference between say the southern United States and the northern United States the uh certain areas of of uh Canada or any country come within the city there's a big difference of environment and culture from a city to the country life and however a person was raised and uh uh uh whatever type of environment you were raised in has a good deal to do with how our lives are shaped, &gt;&gt; how we look at things and how we see things. There are some here who have gone through war and terrible conflict and struggle. It has no doubt uh shaped their lives. There are those here who have lived in dire need in poverty and that will have shaped their lives. People who have gone through difficult times and in poverty and perhaps their parents have had to be extremely frugal even though they may not have missed many meals in their life or uh really gone hungry but they have they have had to get along with meager fair even when those people have been uh perhaps uh uh financially become wellto-do they they will remain I won't say always but quite often remain in that frugal state because that had shaped their lives. And they learned what the value of a of a of a a penny or a dime or a nickel or a dollar or a pound or whatever more or a mark wherever you came from. They learned what the value that was and they remained in that because they were they were shaped uh that way. And it didn't happen overnight. Uh for those of you that are parents, and not only parents, but especially parents, one thing that needs to be really upfront in our minds is that our lives, whether we realize it or not, or whether we're trying to affect an influence on our children, but our lives are shaping those lives. they are getting something uh almost on the basis of osmosis. They just receive something from the way the our lives are conducted, how we look at things, they will they'll be shaped into looking things that way and looking at life the way we look at it. Uh a family member uh just a family member can have a a big effect on others. Thus, spiritual leaders also are uh contribute a great deal and have a powerful influence uh in the way people live in the way people worship. And uh speaking about that, just taking a little twist, uh there was uh some comments made about uh two great leaders who just met recently, president of the United States and uh the the Pope Benedict. Uh those are two powerful men. A person made some comments and I thought I would just uh draw a little bit from it. I said yesterday, this was the day after uh two great pious leaders of the world met in Washington. Excuse me. President Bush an immense has immense temporal power leading one of the richest countries on the planet with the most potent military force and Pope Benedict is a spiritual leader to a billion people with immense influence and the responsibility of a long religious legacy. What could they have talked about? It was the question. What could they have talked about? This gentleman was not too in he this gentleman was not too influenced by it. He said they seem to have patted each other on the back and congratulated each other on their commitment to superstition. In remarks greeting the pope at the White House, President Bush called the United States a nation of prayer. Uh Bush was interrupted by applause as he said, "In a world where some treat life as something to be debased and discarded, we need your message that all human life is sacred and that each of us is willed. that each of us is willed. Benedict responded by praising the role of religion in the United States. And from the dawn of the republic, he said, this is a quote, from the dawn of the republic, America's quest for freedom has been guided by the conviction that the principles governing political and social life are intimately linked to a moral order based on the dominion of God, the creator. He said, "I thought it was ironic that he should speak about the freedom when the forefathers of America that established it fled from his system to get freedom." &gt;&gt; That to me seemed like a paradox. This nation of America received a prophet. I tell you, a holy prophet, &gt;&gt; a prophet of God. Amen. &gt;&gt; And these are his words. And so so is this great nation of ours. We came here and on Plymouth Rock. This nation was founded on freedom of religion because our forefathers had fled Roman persecution of the modern Jezebel system. &gt;&gt; Roman persecution. He said of the modern Jezebel system. He bridges the establishing of America at Plymouth Rock and bringing it forward in just one sentence of the modern Jezebel system that had come up and stood many great persecutions and martyrdom under the false system of Jezebel and according to the Bible of Revelation the 13th chapter which he says America is identified in 13th chapter God had promised them an oasis in a place for the woman was carried into the wilderness where she was fed for a time time and a dividing of time. God had made the promise to America or to the church to the woman to come into this country. It goes on in Revelation 13, all of the other beasts that came up out of the sea, out of the waters, all other beasts that are spoken of in Revelation coming up out of the sea. But he and and he said, "The waters which thou sawest is thickness of multitudes of people." So when they speak of the waters, it is speaking of multitudes, thickness of multitudes of people. All the other beasts, they came up out of the water thickness of multitudes of people. But when the United States came up, it came up out of the earth where there was no people. Remember, when it came up, it looked like a lamb. A lamb has two horns. And that's civil and ecclesiastical powers. And as for my thinking, those two were the ones that were identified in the last few days. &gt;&gt; Immense civil power with immense immense influence throughout the entire globe &gt;&gt; of this planet and immense ecclesiastical power. The prophet said those were the two horns. You won't find anyone else saying that. A prophet could uncover that ahead of time and forewarn us of what was happening. &gt;&gt; The civil and ecclesiastical power. Don't forget their horns. And a horn represents power. He says, "But when they've united, remember then that lamb spake like the dragon before him, and the dragon was Rome." &gt;&gt; So when they join together, it's not that Rome is going to say what the lamb says. It's the lamb is going to speak like the dragon &gt;&gt; going to acquire the same language. He says and then we find that this country come up as a free country and was a lamb which means the lamb of God. But after a while this same system that we have spoke like the dragon and exercised all the power uh that the the dragon had before him. They parallel one to the other perfectly. And remember when Israel came up and uh and took her homeland in Palestine, drove back all the occupants of that land and possessed the land. We came in and took it from the Indians, drove them back and possessed the land. God had a reason for that. God was going to show the world what he could do with a little band of people that wanted freedom and freedom of religion to serve God. I thought that we have lived in some very remarkable time. I'm just starting the message today by saying that we've been shaped by something &gt;&gt; and this power enormous powers which have been unleashed uh upon the earth are shaping nations shaping the way people think. America is shaping the economy largely of the world and other nations are rising. China is rising and shaping the economy and nations are having to respond. In order to do so, they have to have the G7 or the G8 or they have to have the United Nations or they have to have in in the ecclesiastical realm, they have to have the world council uh the council of churches or or the ecumenical council. They're having to come together into these great uh uh unions of of religion or unions of nations or unions of economics in order to try to control and balance things. You know that that's what's happening. We know that's what's happening. But we know also from the from the scripture and now as it's been made known in a prophet messenger's message, we have such a clear understanding of what's taking place. So don't get carried away by these things. And on the other hand, we're not just sitting here, you know, being in opposition to everything. We're not so much uh contrary to things as we are as and you don't have to be contrary to to something to be pro something else. I'm pro the word of God. Uh we're pro the message and what God has said that's what we believe &gt;&gt; and we see it unfolding around us. Amen. So the world itself is is uh they are set on a course of of influence and influencing people and oh I we could stand here and speak about it the whole afternoon but you know we see our our youth you know they're very powerfully influenced by what is seen in the media on the televisions or or the newspapers or magazines or whatever more and and the prophet even mentions it. You know, a woman will come on, she'll have a certain hairdo, and suddenly everybody, what is it? It's a power of influence. A certain dress, a certain hat, a certain this, a certain that, and it's just a power of influence. I was speaking to my wife about it yesterday because the message on my mind, you see, you know, the young fellas that come out with a hat, a cap that's worn one day and and uh and then a a few months or two, three years down the road, that's that's old stuff. We do it a different way now. and and uh you know you to look nice one time, next time if you got to look as frumpy and as as you know they actually have clowns clothes. &gt;&gt; Those long baggy shorts that the young guys wear with a crotch somewhere down around the knees. That's clowns. That's clowns cloth. &gt;&gt; That whole style come from clowns. As far as I'm concerned, they look like clowns and soon they act like clowns. Right. &gt;&gt; I'm not being, you know, I'm not being facitious or nasty. I'm just saying that's that happens to be the truth. If I had my son like look like that, I'd take him to the woodshed. &gt;&gt; Teach him some things. &gt;&gt; We don't have to be swayed and influenced &gt;&gt; even in our services. We don't have to be influenced. The world has nothing to offer us. in our speaking, in our delivery, in the in the message or or how we conduct our service or how we sing songs or how we play our instruments. The world has nothing to offer us. &gt;&gt; We need to be inspired by the Holy Spirit and sing from the heart. And I appreciate when people do that and and play from our soul, play uh uh the music to God and and do things. And when we testify or whatever we do, is there anything wrong with what I'm saying? Jesus said, "I'm I'm against denomination, religion, because it's the mark of the beast." He said, "Rome." You understand? Now, always said the system, &gt;&gt; not the people. moment. Just a few presidents ago in the United States, we had President Reagan and Pope John Paul II. Now, those two powerful influences in the world, they were dead set on a course to destroy the system of communism &gt;&gt; and were successful as far as the former Soviet Union. I'm not speaking of political message. I'm talking about influence. I'm talking about the bridegroom creating his own bride. He made her by influencing her. That's where I'm coming to now. Just watch it. And th those men were set on a course to destroy communism. Now you see the reason I'm saying this is because so many people and you could even be here or could be listening or someone who I don't know who all will hear this service but they say, "Oh, those in the message you're so judgmental." Excuse me. &gt;&gt; Is it not our right to be against something that we believe is evil &gt;&gt; that brings an evil influence, brings people into bondage? &gt;&gt; Can't we be opposed to something &gt;&gt; because I'm opposed to perhaps a lifestyle that the people live or choose to live? I'm against the lifestyle, not the person. the alcoholic. I'm against his style of living. I'm against the alcoholism. &gt;&gt; I'm against same-sex marriage. &gt;&gt; I'm against homosexuality. Not the person, but the system he come under &gt;&gt; or she come under. &gt;&gt; We can be opposed to something. America was opposed to communism. Did they hate all the Russians? No, I don't think so. &gt;&gt; Did they hate the the people that were under the communist system? No. They were against the system and set on a course to destroy the system and use any manner of of method that was available to them to destroy the system because they said the people are bound. the people uh the people are they're enslaved to the system and we need to break that system. That is why a prophet come said I'm against why I'm against organized religion &gt;&gt; and then people want to twist it and say he was against those people that he hated the the Pentecostals or the Lutherans or the Methodists. Absolutely wrong. Absolutely wrong conclusion. If you say that, then you say America hates all communists. Not at all. Not at all. Not at all. &gt;&gt; You get my point. I want to make this very, very clear. You when you're opposed to a system, you're not opposed to the people. &gt;&gt; You cannot hate any person. Right. Right. &gt;&gt; The the scripture teaches us to love the people, &gt;&gt; but we do not love the sin. &gt;&gt; We do not love the system. &gt;&gt; We do not love what they're bound by. &gt;&gt; We have so many of the people here that came from the colonies and the finer people you can't find. &gt;&gt; They're wonderful, wonderful people that have come from the colonies. and and I like to commend them. They're like a trouble-free people. They've been so a wonderful wonderful uh addition to this congregation. And I thank God that that that God led them here. &gt;&gt; Maybe 150 or so that are here. And if those of you that have married the young ladies and the young men from the colonies, you you have wonderful people, the salt of the earth. as our brother Ernie has uh made reference to them. They're not gold, they're platinum. So I I like to give them that bouquet this morning. But the system I could not say enough against it. &gt;&gt; It's a system of fear. It's a system of bondage. And I would do anything I can and and contribute anything that we can to break that system to loose the people out of that fear. &gt;&gt; Terrible fear. They have no right to hold those people. And I'll say these denominations that try to influence people are much worse, even much worse than any political system because they promise a spiritual a spiritual uh benefit that they can't deliver on. &gt;&gt; Look at the churches of this day and how far they have slipped. Look at what's taking place in churches today while I'm ministering and promising them heaven. And they cannot deliver on that promise. &gt;&gt; There's only one way to get to heaven. That's by believing the word of God. If you believe the word of God, your life will be transformed because the Holy Spirit will come and give you truly a new birth. &gt;&gt; And the new birth will not slip back into the old world. These people that come and say they've had a new birth, but they live exactly as the world. Something doesn't jive. Something doesn't uh rec I can't reconcile that. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen. &gt;&gt; And you might be sitting here today and and even as visitors come in or whatever and and see the the mode of dress or the mode of life of the of the people. We have no strings, no no bonds to bind the people. It has to be something from the heart, something that God has done within you. And we're not interested in reforming people and simply having them dress a certain way or speak a certain way or use a certain language. It's got to be from the inside out, from a transformed individual, born again by the spirit and the word of God. &gt;&gt; And then you'll be a different person. Amen. &gt;&gt; The scripture said which we read. The scripture says this and I just want to get I could say so much along the lines I was just on but I want to move forward. Whom he did forno. Now, the scriptures which we read this morning, you might as well understand they're very, very troublesome to the Christian community. Very troublesome. But let's just look at this scripture because it's important in in in context of the subject and I hope that this is the last time I have to deal on this subject. I'd like to maybe go on to something else. For whom he did forno, forno in our scripture reading and in your Bible happens to be the key word. &gt;&gt; Whom he did forno, he also did predestinate. He also did predestinate. He predetermined. I'm going to go into the meaning of these words. So he forneew them. And notice the word that's important before the word forneo. Whom. Whom he forneew &gt;&gt; just didn't say all peoples of the earth but whom he forneew &gt;&gt; them he also did predestinate. &gt;&gt; This is very clearly defined. &gt;&gt; And what did he predestinate them to? To be conformed to the image. I'm going to make them to a certain image. I'm going to shape them to a certain image. I'm going to deal with them till they come into this image. And it may cause some trials. It may cost it that they may come under a certain sound of the preaching. They may have to be in a certain place. They have to hear certain sermons. I have to deal with them in a certain way. And God has such a a a massive amount of directions that he can come to a person. He can deal with a person individually. Right now, you know, you've been praying for individuals that they would come to Christ. God can meet a person in the darkest spot. They can be in a bar. They can be watching television right now. They can be at some sports event. They can be in some uh drunken or drug stuper. And this Holy Spirit I know can go down to their room and meet them at this very instant. &gt;&gt; That's where our faith is anchored. &gt;&gt; And reveal the need to them. &gt;&gt; Whom he also did forno, he did also predestinate to be conformed to be conformed. God's not done working on us. God's not done shaping us. He is the master sculptor. And he knows what he's going to make out of this stone. This stone, this rock that's you and that's this stone that's me. He's he's shaping us and making us. And but he does not go in here what he's using as his tools. But the greatest tool he has and I suggest to you at this moment is his word. He shapes people by his word. If you go to our last service, I just made the analogy of the young man. He may be in his teens and he's a very awkward young man, but he has a desire within him. He wants to be a brain surgeon. He wants to be some kind of uh uh he wants to specialize in surgery as a as a brain surgeon. And what what takes him from that awkward teenager to be an accomplished professional surgeon? What takes him in that span of time is books &gt;&gt; and things that he hears and men that speak to him, instructors and advisors and someone who will be a mentor for him and counsel him. And over a period of time and years and through intense dedication that young a very cumbersome young man will become a someone who is regarded in the community as the finest brain surgeon in the whole area. &gt;&gt; It was a book &gt;&gt; and we were a people without form. &gt;&gt; We were a people who didn't have a direction. &gt;&gt; We were a people that were in confusion. We were a people who did not under even understand the book. But we had a guide called the Holy Spirit of God. And that Holy Spirit sent the word directed to us in each generation in each season. He took this time locked word and and and sent it through his messenger at each season. And he sent a messenger in this season to be able to say to the children, here's the word. Amen. &gt;&gt; Here are the scriptures for this time. And now when when the Holy Spirit unlocks it and reveals it to you, you don't have to understand it completely, but reveals it to you. Yes, that is the word for this time. I believe that. I see that. Then the Holy Spirit comes within you and and unlocks the dynamics of that word and it begins to change your life. &gt;&gt; And as it transforms your life, you take on the appearance, you take on the character of the very word you believe. [Applause] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; That's the principle. Amen. &gt;&gt; So whom he did forno them he also did predestinate and them that he did forno. To forno is to fore ordain to know before or to have knowledge of beforehand. So now whom is identifies individuals or people whom he forneew. He had knowledge of them beforehand to predestinate or predetermine those whom God forneew so that they would love him. &gt;&gt; I like that content. He forneew them &gt;&gt; because he knew that they would love him. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; It also comes from uh from a compound word whom he forneew is to know, to understand, and to perceive and to have knowledge of. He forneew them. Now to to know to know something uh uh we're not talking about God now. We're just talking about you as a moment. But in the Bible to know something it had it is a Greek word but to the Greeks they understood it one way and the Jews understood it another. And here's the way the Greeks understood it. To know meant to know facts. Doesn't the Bible say the Greeks seek wisdom? &gt;&gt; And so to the Greeks to know something was to know facts that may or may not affect may or may not affect one's conduct. It just to know facts but it didn't have any any effect on the individual's conduct. To the Jew, completely different. To the Jew, true knowledge always manifested itself in one's conduct. If you really know something, you say, "Well, I know something about God," it will change your conduct. If you say, "I know Jesus Christ." And m millions will say, "Yes, I know Jesus Christ." But they don't know him as a Jew would understand it. If you know him, it changes your conduct. &gt;&gt; It's not a matter of us being able to change ourselves through a series of good works. It's not that. It's a matter of the going back to the principle. If we know, if we know that this message, if we know by the kind of knowledge that God's talking about, I know that this is God's vindicated word, I know that it's the truth. That knowledge will change your conduct because the Holy Spirit will come and and give the dynamics to it within you. Amen. &gt;&gt; To the Jew, one did not know something until the fact had a practical outworking in their life. &gt;&gt; He didn't know the fact until that had happened. And then he said he would predestinate. He also would predestinate. To predestinate, and these are just foundation for me. To predestinate is to determine before or to ordain. See, it's not him that runth, but it's him. It's God that shows mercy. &gt;&gt; It's not we that run or we that will to do a certain thing, but it's God that chooses and for ordains things to pred to predetermine to decide beforehand. And in the New Testament, to pre to predestinate is God decreeing from eternity. to for ordain to a point beforehand and that also is to mark out the boundaries that comes from another word to to predestinate is to define. It's not just to determine that a certain thing a certain individual will be a certain will have a certain experience. It isn't God just predestinating that you would hear the word. Not just that. Not just that you would come to salvation, to redemption, to the revelation, all of those things. It's not just that, but it comes to predestinate. It's important that we get this. to predestinate is that God in determining that by his fornowledge determined that you would be what you are. He also made a definition and defined what you would be within that. &gt;&gt; It is to mark out certain boundaries or limits. You see, so one person is birthed by a new birth by the Holy Spirit and by the word by God's decree. &gt;&gt; You know, this is difficult for a lot of people in this day where everybody has their rights. &gt;&gt; Well, I can tell you one thing in this day and age, it's God that has his rights. And God's rights are absolutely uh it it's it's a it's a it's an absolute. That's the best way to describe it. That's God's rights. God has a right to choose who will be his bride, his wife. God has a right to choose who will be in his family. You may choose that we're going to have a child, but you don't choose whether it's a boy or a girl. You don't you don't have the choice in conception. God holds that to himself. And you know, with all of this business about rights, there's there's really the world doesn't get uh they don't get into that because they know it's out of their hands. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; God makes a choosing &gt;&gt; of what the conception is. &gt;&gt; And you as parents, you never have had a choice what color their eyes are going to be. &gt;&gt; Whether they're left-handed or right-handed, you don't have a choice. There's so many things you don't have a choice at. And we don't have a choice when it comes to salvation. &gt;&gt; If God maybe have maybe have a question on that say, "What about my free will?" I can tell you one thing. Your free will will not supersedes God's will. &gt;&gt; That's for sure. and of God's wills that you shall come to redemption and that you were in him and in his mind and in his thoughts before the foundation of the world. There's no way for you to stay out of it. &gt;&gt; And if you were never there, there's no way to get into it. &gt;&gt; And that has nothing to do with I'm in a downtime. I'm in a low moment. I'm I'm I'm I'm being, you know, just hounded and pounded by doubts and unbelief and so on. That has nothing to do with it. &gt;&gt; That has nothing to do with it. &gt;&gt; You just come to a place and quite frankly, I'd sooner serve God. Even if I was not going to be, &gt;&gt; if I was never in his mind, I'd still want to serve God. &gt;&gt; How can I compare this life with something else of debauchery in the world? &gt;&gt; What emptiness there is out there. waste your life and have Satan just be so disrespectful upon people. What in the world? Why would a person want to give their life? Why would a person want Satan to rob a man of his respect of his health or a woman of his respect of his health, of his mental intelligence, and just destroy him physically with all of the all of the they call enjoyments of the world? Well, to me, friends, &gt;&gt; you know, there's big things today about where you can smoke and where you can't smoke and whose smoke you're going to breathe and who smoke you're not going to breathe and, you know, you got to be so many feet from the from the front door or whatever more. All kinds of things are going on. It's just idiocy. &gt;&gt; It's bizarre. Amen. &gt;&gt; I think the thing that is just so incomprehensible is that a man or a woman who know that this is destroying them will go to the counter, a cash counter and pay about60 or $70 for a carton of cigarettes and walk home and inhale that stuff into their systems and then wonder why they're poppers. &gt;&gt; Right. and wonder why they've got health problems. They they paid for it. &gt;&gt; Actually paid for it. Isn't that incredible? &gt;&gt; I have been out of the loop for so all my life really. But I stood and you maybe heard me say this once, but I stood behind a man in a in a pharmacy and uh he didn't have anything. Uh and he said something to the lady. I was right behind him and uh and he pulled a $100 bill out of his pocket. I thought, "Wow, he's, you know, buying something." And she reaches up behind her and pulls down a carton of cigarettes. And I was just like a little kid, I guess. I thought, a $100 bill. I have a lot of respect for $100. And there laid a carton of cigarettes and a $100 bill beside it. And she scooped up that $100 bill, rang thing, and and gave him a little bit of change after he was done to 20 or $30 or whatever it was. And I was so delirious. I didn't hardly know what I was standing there for. I just couldn't believe I couldn't believe that a man with any intelligence was going to give up that kind of money so he could go home and be sick. &gt;&gt; Do you ever imagine things that are kind of, you know, just childish? Now that I kind of got your attention on that, I'll just take a moment. I've imagined sometimes they always talk about these extraterrestrial, you know, beings coming to the Earth, these, you know, people from Mars or something. I'd like to see if one of those came to the Earth and they're trying to figure out, you know, how you're living and they come and they can see you eating. Yeah. All right, that makes some sense. See, then they see this fellow and he's got a cigarette fire. gets all red, inhales a bunch of smoke, blows it out. So their leader is trying to figure out what this what he's doing. So he goes and asks him, "What are you doing?" Well, is is uh well, I'm you know, he tries to explain what he's doing. Does it make you feel good? No. Quite frankly, takes my breath away and makes me cough. Uh oh. Are you getting paid to do it? No, I pay to do it. And by the time this thing this conversation has gone over, I can say this guy probably says, "Let's go back to Mars." One thing's for sure, these people here, they need they need a whole lot more help than we can give them. &gt;&gt; Is that all right? Now I've come to the point God predestinated. He said he forneew people and predestinated here it is to be conformed to come under a a process of being conformed to the image &gt;&gt; of his son. &gt;&gt; That's the purpose. &gt;&gt; He's going to conform them. And to conform them is to fashion them. Your hardships are used by God to fashion you. &gt;&gt; The people that you really like and the people, some that you don't really like are there to fashion you. &gt;&gt; You know, it's not the smooth thing that really uh has a has a shaping or designing, but it's the rough. It's the knife or the horn or the chisel or the hammer or all of these things that don't really indicate something that is delightful. But it is those things. It's the sandpaper. It's the grit. It's the agitation. It's the irritation. And you put a stone into a into a ball mill and let the let it has to have it. It won't just work by itself. It has to have some grit. It has to have some powder in there. and finally it comes out of beautiful shiny stone. God has a way of sculpting us &gt;&gt; and he uses all kinds of things. You might say that preacher I don't really enjoy. Well, you better just sit and listen to him. Maybe this morning you're not really getting a whole lot. But you need to just sit and listen. I believe that God brought you here. I believe that God sent me here. &gt;&gt; Otherwise, I wouldn't be here. And these things uh that we are hearing and that you're hearing aren't just for this moment, but it is so that God will take you as an individual. If you believe you're one of those that are fornown, &gt;&gt; you believe you're one of those predestinated, &gt;&gt; then God has ordained that you shall be conformed to the image of his son. And incidentally, incidentally, I'd like to I I want to make a very very emphatic statement at this moment. Whenever we speak of us being conformed to the image of the son uh or conformed into the image of God and whenever we speak of the rapture and these kind of things I have found that our our thinking and I have found that our words are very very uh selfc centered. We think about being into the image of his son so that we so that we, you know, we'll have that ful fulfillment so that we we think of the rapture so that we will escape this terrible place. But that's not God's thought. God's thought is that they will be conformed to the image of his son so that his son can be the firstborn among many brethren. All the emphasis is on him. Amen. &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; All the emphasis, the reason why there is a rapture and the reason why there is to be a resurrection is because this shall be the final assault of our Lord Jesus Christ upon his enemy death. &gt;&gt; And it is to bring him the ultimate victory that I have brought a people and bypass death, overpowered death. He has done it. It's not for us to be, you know, to finally get some escape. &gt;&gt; That's not the emphasis so that I'll get out of this world and I'll be beyond temptation. It's that he might be glorified that his that his uh purchase at Calvary, the full purchased price will now be brought down effective upon Satan's head. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Wonderful. It's like he has clubbed him on the head to crush his head. He did so at Calvary, but it's like the final blow because it says the last enemy to be destroyed is death. &gt;&gt; That is what we are awaiting. &gt;&gt; And we're awaiting that so our God, our Lord will have the full consequence of his victory. &gt;&gt; I just don't have enough words to say it, but it's all in him, friends. Yeah. &gt;&gt; Yes. We will have an escape. It's like a side benefit. &gt;&gt; Yeah. We will get out of we will have the change of the body, but he's doing it for his glory to demonstrate his complete power. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So, he's going to conform us to the image of his son. And the image is the figure or the likeness, the image of the son of God which true Christians are transformed into. Brother Brandham says and who's this Melzdc? What happens to the plant? It rots. What's the first thing he goes through now process? A stock. What's next? The tsel. What's the next? It's the shock. Then the grain comes out of that just the three stages of it till it gets to the grain. He said God vindicates that. In other words, God vindicate. What is the vindication? I I pondered this a good deal. I want to bring it to you. God vindicates that. The vindication of it is that it started with a grain of wheat and it ends with a grain of wheat. That's the vindication. When the little blade comes out of the out of the ground, God sees wheat. We see a blade. It does. It's not the same color. It's not the same shape. And that has no resemblance of what went into the ground. But it is God's vindication. And God is vindicating when it comes into the stalk, into the tossel, and into the shock that holds it. But it's it's held in the shock. It's the those three stages until until the grain appears. &gt;&gt; See, until the grain matures. &gt;&gt; The church has come. We've come through Luther and justification. We've come through sanctification. We've come now through Pentecost and the baptism of the Holy Spirit, the restoration of gifts. We've come through all of those things and are held there. He said in these words now till it gets to the grain to redeem. This is the process of redemption. If we put it into botney life, if if if seeds were sown and they just rotted, I would say that that seed is not experiencing any redemption. &gt;&gt; But when it's sewn in the ground, rot and life comes up, it's in a process. It comes into the stalk into the tossel and into the shuck. And in that shuck now within the shock is being held wheat again. That seed has had a full redemption because what it was and it appeared to be lost has now come back the full distance and it is and that's God's vindication. That's what he's referring to. Now the church, my brother, my sister, I'm speaking on, the heavenly bridegroom has created his own bride. He has brought her through all of the uh uh a whole process. your physical body. I took a service on came from the eternities when God was was seeing a a a clinker a spark come off of the planet and it dropped for millions of years and said stop. And then this spinning mass that we're on today, it didn't always look like this. And then there was within the elements and the chemistry of that very planet, this planet earth began to be potachsh and calcium and various things that make up your body. And a prophet of God, how I'm glad I have these words that have come from him. Said, God, what was he doing? Asked the question. He was making you. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's this. If God went to that kind of degree, if God, eternal God, took that kind of span of eons of time, ages upon ages to bring a little body out of the dust of the earth that's going to last here for a few short years. Will it disappear, be like a vapor? Every one of us, if if we go the way of the grave, not going to be here that long. If my God, your God, did that for this body, how much more will he do, how much more did he will he shape and make that image of the soul? &gt;&gt; Are you with me? &gt;&gt; That's why I took I took that over the over the weeks that we've been the physical part, the spirit part, but the soul part. And God's whole focus is that he's going to conform conformed. This body is not being conformed to the son of God, but that life that's in you, that seed that was predestinated in you is ordained and appointed to to become in the very image of the son of God. And I want to just say quickly because we are where we are in time because God's time piece of Israel all indicators indicate to one thing the world leaders where they are you can speak about politics you can speak about religion you can speak about it from any direction you want to speak and brother Brandham uses a another term which I think of quite often the position of the nations at this time. Amen. &gt;&gt; The position of the nations at the all of these things are pointing to one thing and that is we we talk about rapture. We have a rapture message. If that is the case, then the word of God, listen close now. I'm coming to what I really want to speak on. Then then God has reserved a certain word and has brought a certain people whom he forneew. He also did predestinate to this time and to this season and to the very seat you're sitting in this morning. He's ordained and appointed you to that time. And and in God's mind, it was that you should hear certain things that would speak to the inner soul of your being. And then by hearing that word the channel to the soul which is one channel is it can either have unbelief or faith in it. And this morning I'm praying that there will be channel after channel that will have nothing other than faith in it. And that channel of faith hears the word and it goes down to the soul. That is the instrument of God whereby he begins to transform that individual &gt;&gt; into the image of his son. Now his son is the word &gt;&gt; and it transforms that individual you as the individual into the image of the word. The word which is spoken &gt;&gt; your word body. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; There is no other way for you to take on the shape of the word. The young lad is becoming a brain surgeon, but you are becoming a a candidate for the rapture. [Applause] &gt;&gt; Follow this closely. God came to Abram before his name was changed and the prophet said an idol worshipper. God came to Abram and called him and spoke to him and how it happened how it was registered in Abram's life. I don't know. But it moved him so deeply that and God said, "Leave your kindred, leave your people &gt;&gt; to a land that I will show you." And listen now to these words, and I will make of thee a great nation, and I will bless thee. It's amazing. Where's Abram's choice here? Where's his choosing? Where's his free will? &gt;&gt; It doesn't exist. &gt;&gt; This is all God. &gt;&gt; Hey, listen friends. This happens to be our father. &gt;&gt; We're living here in Leodysia, but you haven't got anything to do with what God is doing. &gt;&gt; All you can do is say, "Here I am. &gt;&gt; Take me. &gt;&gt; Whatever there is, just take me. &gt;&gt; I yield myself." That's the only thing you can do is give yourself over and yield yourself. And he says, I will bless thee and make thy name great, and thou shalt be a blessing, and I will bless them that bless thee, and curse them that curse thee, and in thee shall all the families of the earth be blessed. And God went on to say to Abraham, Abram at this time I just use Abraham says, "I will make you I will make you I will form you." &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; I'll form you. I'll make you a father of nations. Now listen, just listen now close and then it can take a quantum leap to the rapture. This is our father in the faith. and he's hearing some words. I'm going to make you a father of nations. How is he going to get from where he was, perhaps a sterile man, certainly with a barren wife? How is he going to get from where he's standing to be a father of nations? What's going to change him? What's going to transform him? He had to take on those words. [Music] And when he took on those words and believed them, th those words shaped him into the father of nations. &gt;&gt; Here you are. &gt;&gt; Here I am in bodies that are essentially corrupting. &gt;&gt; How are we going to get from this corruption to incorruption? It's no different than Abraham being his wife barren, him perhaps sterile, having no child, being an idol worshipper, and God saying, "I'm going to make you a father of nations. How was God going to make him? How was God going to shape him from where he was to what God had in his mind he shall be?" Amen. &gt;&gt; God used no other tool, no other tool but his word. &gt;&gt; And he just kept speaking his word. Spoke his word, Abraham believed him. Spoke it again, Abraham believed him. Spoke it again, Abraham believed him. And God was conforming him. Actually transforming a man into the father of nations. Amen. &gt;&gt; Here we sit today and we can say, "Well, I'm afflicted or I'm sick or I'm this or I'm that or I've heard about this rapture. I've heard about the change of the body so many times that that is irrelevant to me in this service today." It is what do you believe? Amen. &gt;&gt; And if you uh are absolutely thoroughly spiritually convinced this message is a final word sent from God that this message is indeed the rapture call. &gt;&gt; There's something in us. There's something in us. There's a promise &gt;&gt; in the scripture that somebody is going to experience the resurrection. &gt;&gt; The Bible tells us that when God promised Abraham a land and God told him to go walking over the land, the only thing that was motivating him was some words that he had heard. &gt;&gt; You go and walk. and he began to physically walk over the land. &gt;&gt; We have a word that tells us and now it's a vindicated word. This isn't my idea. It's not William Brham's idea. It's no one else's idea. God said, "This is the time. &gt;&gt; This is what I'm going to do. &gt;&gt; And this is the kind of ministry it's going to be and I'm going to vindicate it. &gt;&gt; I'm going to prove it." Yes, &gt;&gt; God identified by his own characteristics. Let us see Jesus. &gt;&gt; Oh, show us the father. What are all those messages? God confirming his word. &gt;&gt; God coming back be in behind those words and confirming it by the supernatural. And now we take that supernatural say that is the reality. God himself did this. No one did this. It has nothing to do with me or this service this morning. Has nothing to do with that. All All I can do is say God did that. &gt;&gt; I heard brother Brandon pray for some somebody and he he he just said if if you're desiring that stand. I just stood up where I was in the middle of my studies. I said that's for me. &gt;&gt; What am I doing? I'm putting footsteps on that promise. I'm walking in this promise. We shall be changed. &gt;&gt; That's where I'm walking. That's where you must walk. I am walking on this promise. We shall all be changed. We walk on that promise. We put footsteps on that promise. And by believing that word, that word will change your body. &gt;&gt; Some of us just listen friends, don't get it wrong. You can't just live any way you want and just say, "Oh, the change is going to come somehow." You know, the message says this. The message is that just forget it. &gt;&gt; It's something that has made a reality to you that you think about every day. &gt;&gt; And you're walking on it. You're walking on that land. You're walking on that promise. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; I shall see those who have gone on before. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I'm going to meet those that have gone on before. I have a mother that's gone and a father that's gone. We have friends out of this assembly that have gone. I have a prophet messenger that's gone. I'm walking on that pro. I'm walking on that promise. I'm putting footsteps on it. We think about it every day. Listen to me, my brother, my sister. Without that, you can't be changed. It is the word of the promise that you receive and it comes down into your soul. You walk on that promise and that word changes you. That's the change. That's the change. [Music] And because the prophet says there'll be a sweep that'll go over you. How long is that sweep? This may be it now. &gt;&gt; In fact, as I suggest to you, you've been under the sweep. &gt;&gt; You've been under the breath of God. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And like Peter said, hear my words. &gt;&gt; I say the same things today. You've heard things of your own idea, things of your own thoughts, but now you need to hear these words that God is speaking. This is a sweep. &gt;&gt; This is a change. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Not something up high in the sky. Not just something in the future. You're being changed that they might be transformed, conformed into the image of his dear son. that he not to get us out of this trap, but that he might be the firstborn among many brethren. &gt;&gt; And when we stand beyond the curtain of time, he is the one that's going to be glorified. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; This is the people I bought. &gt;&gt; This is the people I paid for. Look at them without spot, without wrinkle, without any such thing. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; We'll cast our crowns at his feet. The angels will cast down themselves. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; This is the change, friends. &gt;&gt; That's the word that changed them. &gt;&gt; What changed Peter from being a coward and cursing &gt;&gt; like two months ago? &gt;&gt; That's it. You folks, now be honest with yourself. &gt;&gt; If you had heard that I had entered into a curses, saying, "I know nothing about this message. I know nothing about this Christ. I have nothing to do with that." And then see me 60 days later and say, "Hear my words." &gt;&gt; You say, "Well, just a second." &gt;&gt; That just shows us how carnal we can be. But what happened was &gt;&gt; what happened was Peter had believed the words. &gt;&gt; He did have a revelation that this was the Christ. &gt;&gt; And under the pressure and under the bombardment for a moment he let go. &gt;&gt; But Jesus said when you're converted strengthen the brethren. &gt;&gt; We have to look beyond the weaknesses of our individual self and those around us. We are people under the promise. &gt;&gt; We're a people under the Exodus promise. &gt;&gt; And the Holy Spirit will come to bring into effect the word for that season. And the word for this season is a change of the body. &gt;&gt; And we believe the word that we heard. That's the only way. Peter simply believed the word that he heard. He believed when Jesus said, "Go to Jerusalem and tarry." &gt;&gt; And he did it. &gt;&gt; The Holy Spirit. &gt;&gt; You've heard me say it before. I'll say it again. The Holy Spirit did not come just say to Peter, James, John, the other disciples, the women. The Holy Spirit didn't come to 120 only. The Holy Spirit came to the word, &gt;&gt; right? It just so happened that 120 believed it. &gt;&gt; The Bible says he was seen of above 500 brethren &gt;&gt; after his resurrection, &gt;&gt; but 380 did not get to the upper room. &gt;&gt; If you'd have gone to them and said, "Do you believe that was Jesus Christ the resurrection?" "Yes, I do." "Do you believe what he says? You believe he's God in the flesh?" "Yeah, I sure do. What were you doing when they were in the upper room? Well, you know, the pressures of life and the things I had to do and all of these things made it quite impossible for me. The Holy Spirit didn't come just to individuals is my point. The Holy Spirit came to the word. &gt;&gt; God's not coming to you with this change because you're a nice person or a bad person or for any other reason. He's coming to you because you happen to be a vessel of his word. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; The Holy Spirit cannot help but come to the word. &gt;&gt; He is the author of that word. &gt;&gt; He must come to it and he will come to it in spite of who you are, what you do, your failings or whatever more. The Holy Spirit will come to the word. &gt;&gt; My question as I come to a close and I'm far from over, but I'll say my question is, believe thou this Hallelujah. Yes sir. &gt;&gt; Believest thou this &gt;&gt; Holy Spirit &gt;&gt; will come to the word he has given authorship to the word for this season. And God has done more than he should have had to d do by sending a messenger for 33 years across the globe letting the people know this is the time children &gt;&gt; and you are the people. &gt;&gt; And thus he would end his ministry by speaking rapture &gt;&gt; things that are to be. modern events which was the event after the resurrection. Modern events made clear by the prophecy and the last one leadership and took a few minutes in another service for communion which is exactly what Jesus did in his life. gave him the final third pull ministry, &gt;&gt; concluded with it with the messages that were largely from about chapter 15 or so on in John's gospel to the end. He's giving those in the upper room actually in the in the banquet room, the last supper room. He's giving his most intimate to those that believed him and those that had followed him. You read in John, it'll show you ahead of the chapters spoken in the Passover chamber. Those were to an intimate. Those were whom &gt;&gt; he forneew. &gt;&gt; They were ordained to that time. God knew that they may fail and and flounder yet, but God was sending his spirit to that word &gt;&gt; and they shall fulfill their pro their purpose in that time &gt;&gt; as God knows there's a people that have believed the message that he has sent and they will fulfill his purpose in this time. If there isn't a rapture, God has failed. If there isn't a resurrection, God has failed. But God sent a word for his children to believe. &gt;&gt; And that word when it's believed changes, transforms you into the image of his son. Who is his son? The word. &gt;&gt; You believe the word. &gt;&gt; The word transforms you. You come into your word body. [Applause] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. [Music] Well, I had 19 slides, but I'm not getting to them. And we're we'll do it another time. Isn't it wonderful? &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; When he was on the cross, &gt;&gt; we were on his mind. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And he's at the right hand of the majesty on high at this moment. and and we're on his mind. &gt;&gt; And he's not only there, but he's here. &gt;&gt; And his children are on his mind. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Oh, I hope this is a reality to you. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Isn't it? &gt;&gt; Is it to you a reality? &gt;&gt; Glory. Glory. The whole theme of the message this morning, the whole theme is we are being transformed by the word that he has sent. &gt;&gt; And as it is spoken by the inspiration of the Holy Spirit and you receive it, you don't have to worry anymore. You're going to come into the image of his son. And listen, listen as I close. His son, it was appointed that he should be just a lad. It was appointed that he at 12 years old would be in the temple with the great leaders. It was appointed that he should live his life 30 years and then start his ministry. It was appointed and he lived it all out because that was the word for the season. If there's anything that's clear in brother Brandham's message, it is that there's a word allotted for a certain season. And there's a word allotted to the individual. &gt;&gt; Your part no one can take that. You have a part of the word might be small, might be large, might be of a few days. I've thought about this very thing in the context of Silas's life. Very short, not long. God dealing with and then God takes him. I don't understand that. But I leave that entirely in God's hands. That is another thing we have no choice about. You'll be here as long as God wants you here and God will take you from here. But while you're here, you have a part. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Can you say amen once again? &gt;&gt; You have a part and you will live that. And that part is Christ. &gt;&gt; That part is the word. &gt;&gt; And that word is tied to what not only is over here. You're here in a physical form, but that word is tied to beyond the realm, beyond the curtain of time. &gt;&gt; The theophony that's beside you. &gt;&gt; You cannot separate that word from that. That is a word body. You skipped around that by a natural birth that brought you into this condition, into this state, into a into into a dying condition. But that word body knows nothing about dying. The word body knows nothing about corruption. How are you going to get from this one into that one? By believing that portion of the word that God has sent. &gt;&gt; I hope that's clear. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Let's just stand, shall we? &gt;&gt; Why don't we just thank him? &gt;&gt; Raise your hand. Raise your voice. Whatever you'd like to do. Say, "I thank you, Father. Thank you for sending what you sent. Thank you for the presence of the Holy Spirit. Thank you for what you're doing, oh God. Here I am. Here I am, Lord. Just take me. Take me. Do what you would. Mold me. Shape me. You're the creator. Make me into that image. Oh God, I'm here surrendering myself, submitting myself. Oh, Father, we thank you for the goodness for your mercy and your great great love that you've shown to the children of men. What you're doing, Lord, amongst us. Oh God, I pray you'll bring your word with a greater reality. Give us a mind. Give us a spirit, oh father, to receive the full measure &gt;&gt; of your word. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord Jesus. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.

Look at the words if you would please as we Death hath no terrors for the bloodbought one. Oh, glory, hallelujah, to the lamb. I one of the things I like about the song is it's very praise and worship oriented. And I believe we should just give him glory. Friends, &gt;&gt; if you're thankful for what you've received, if you're thankful for what God has, &gt;&gt; Exodus people, people come under the transforming power of almighty God. people who's not having to eat what other people are having to eat. &gt;&gt; It would make you sick. &gt;&gt; Here you are. &gt;&gt; What has done that? God and God alone. &gt;&gt; Are you thankful? &gt;&gt; Oh, amen. Just break loose of your shackles and give him praise and do what's in your heart to do. But let's just sing this together as we come to a close now. as glory hallelujah to the lamb [Music] of the Hey, [Music] [Music] in our single to our souls to the world and sing hallelujah to the spirit Heat.
