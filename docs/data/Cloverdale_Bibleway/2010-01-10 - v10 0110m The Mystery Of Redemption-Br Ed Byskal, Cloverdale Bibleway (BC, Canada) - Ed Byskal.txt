Is that your desire this morning? &gt;&gt; Amen. Let's sing that song. There is a fountain open in the house of David. There is a fountain open in the house to you. [Applause] And there are streams of grace flowing down from Calary. Now receive. [Music] There is a ground in the house to you. [Music] And there are streams of gra [Music] from Calary now. [Music] Amen. Amen. And I just have one prayer request this morning. Brother Norm Wood asked that we'd remember his daughter-in-law's mother. She's in the hospital with low blood blood pressure and hemorrhaging. We want to remember her in prayer. We also reme want to remember brother Victor Adamora who's still in Nigeria that God would be with him and lead him as as he's there. We ask brother Tom to come and open the service in a word of prayer this morning. And as he comes, let's sing that chorus. He cares for you. Through sunshine or shadows, he cares for you. And sometimes when I think about this song, I try and sing it almost as a ministry to somebody else. He cares for you. Think about somebody in your heart this morning that's really going through a hard place and minister to them. He carth for you. He carth for you. He cares for you through sunshine and shadows. He car for you. [Music] He cares for you. [Music] He car for you. [Music] Sunshine or shine [Music] caring for you. &gt;&gt; How many believe that he cares for you this morning? &gt;&gt; Amen. Why don't we just hold our hands and our hearts up before the throne of grace? Lord, we know by your word it declares that you'd care for us. You cared for that little widow woman one day, Lord, when Elijah had come by her way. And Lord Jesus, we believe that the word of God has come by our way and that you care for us. And we pray Lord that as we as believers take a hold of the promises that they're yay and amen to them that believe. We know that you're a seeking savior. You know your eye is on the sparrow and I know his eye is watching me. And so Lord, for every hand that's been uplifted and the requests that brother Kim has spoken, Brother Norm has pinned it down on paper. But Lord, before it was pinned down, you knew it. And Lord, that is our consolation this morning that you're an all- knowing God. And you can be touched by the feeling of our infirmity. So we pray, God, you'll meet every need, every burden, every request, Lord, that is raised before the throne of grace this morning. And as we have prayed this morning that you'll anoint the man of God. Would you anoint us to hear what the spirit would say to the church this morning? We don't want to be dull of hearing, Lord. But we want to be quick to hear that you would open our eyes and open our hearts to see the glory of God as it would pass by or away. That we can say, "Pass me not, oh gentle Savior. Hear my humble cry this morning." We have needs and we're a needy people. Speak to us deeply within our souls this morning. anointing both speaker and hearer that you'll be glorified amongst us, Lord, for the specials. We pray that you'll anoint it, Lord. And may it be a blessed day in the presence of God as we commit this morning's service to you in Jesus name. Amen. Brother Tom, you may be seated this morning. Amen. Let's sing that uh song. We've got the power in the name of Jesus. Amen. [Music] We've got the power [Music] in the name of Jesus. We've got the power. In the name of the Lord, [Music] we cannot be defeated.

And uh just as we pray prepare to sing that, we have an announcement for the young peoples. is this Friday night at 7:30. And uh you'll all want to be there for that, I'm sure. Well, may mean by you all, I mean all the young people. You know, I can remember when I got to be just old enough, you couldn't go to those things, and it was always so disappointing that I couldn't get to go. But I'm way past that now. Amen. Springs of living water. I thirsted in a barren land, a sin and shame, and nothing. Did you find anything satisfying there? &gt;&gt; Nothing. Amen. I thirsted in the barren land of sin and shame and nothing satisfying there I found. But to the blessed cross of Christ one day I came. West springs of living water to bound. And now I'm drinking out the springs of living water. Happy. My soul is satisfied. I'm drinking the springs of living water. Wonderful. [Music] I'll sweep the living waters from the hills of God.

While children search, but they can't seem to find. It's time we took a closer look. Got back to living by the holy book. No compromise without getting slap. You see, church won't go forward. It will just go by. We'll know the tree by the fruit we see. Serving God has no in between. We're either cold or we're hot. He said in his word, "Lukewarm shall have no part."

I asked Sister Natasha to sing that song, The Absolute. We don't have any other absolute. &gt;&gt; Brother Ryan is going to be married in a few days and Sister Yolena. Yolena. Hope I'm saying that right. And we can't be there. Brother Ryan and Sister Yolena. Where's Sister Yolena? Over here. Yes. Someone who's going to be a bride. We should have her right down here in front where everybody can see her. They're going to be married in a few days. And I want to just say how much uh we appreciate their lives and brother Ryan's labor of love. &gt;&gt; We appreciate it. [Music] [Applause] And we're wishing both of you, Sister Elena and brother Ryan, God's richest blessings on your marriage. And we're also asking that our Lord Jesus who went to the marriage in Canaa of Galilee may this time go to the marriage in Maui. And I believe it won't make any difference to him whether it's Galilee or Maui. &gt;&gt; May he sanction it. May he sanctify it. And may you have a happy and lovely day and life together. And when you're home, we'll try to make sure that it's that way. We enjoyed the choir and the efforts of all of you who sang. God bless you. It's wonderful to hear people just sing hosana hosana with all their heart and strength and soul. And to all those that are uh connected with us on the internet today, we want to say to that congregation as well because there's so many others, many more than is here. Many more than are here. Probably somewhere between 20 and 30 countries in each service. That's just live streaming. And we don't know how many hundreds more in the uh in the archives that in the very next week. And they're just like you and I. They like to come to church. They want to be there. And so many of them haven't got that opportunity. But today they're we trust that they will be blessed exactly the same as we are. And we wish that they were here. But one day we will be together. &gt;&gt; Amen. Hallelujah. [Music] God bless you. [Music] I'm going to have us turn in just a moment to the word, but I uh just to put our minds in in tune with where I want to go today, I just want to sing that chorus. Redeemed, redeemed, redeemed by the blood of the lamb, redeemed, redeemed, his child, and forever I am. Would you help us with redeemed [Music] by the blood of the lamb redee? Redee [Music] redee. redeemed my father. Redee [Music] is high forever. I am. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; We're just rejoicing in it. I'll have you turn in your Bibles to 1 Corinthians uh the 15th chapter and we're going to read just uh three verses there 45 to 47. We've been speaking about great deal about redemption. We spoke a couple of services at least on uh the lamb and the book of redemption. Uh that we spoke on the garden of Eden restored. Of course res restoration is redemption. So it is along the same theme and I would like to uh speak this morning on the mystery of redemption because it's always been mysterious and mysterious in that we don't know and we're in a mystery. We're part of that redemption but we do not know uh and did not expect to be perhaps exactly where we are. We didn't expect our to experience what we've experienced in our lives. And so it's all it can be a mis mystery. It's mysterious. But our confidence is in God &gt;&gt; who has written the book &gt;&gt; from the beginning to the end. &gt;&gt; And we are that book. We're not just part of it, but we are the book. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So, uh I I trust that the scriptures will tie together for you. and you pray for me and we'll pray for one another as we already have. And so it is written. 1 Corinthians 15:45. And so it is written, the first man, Adam, was made a living soul. The last Adam was made a quickening spirit. How be it, that was not first which is spiritual, but that which is natural, and afterward that which is spiritual. The first man is of the earth, earthy, and the second man is the Lord from heaven. Amen. &gt;&gt; I want to say before we read our second scripture, all born again believers that are born again of the Holy Spirit are part of the first and the last Adam. &gt;&gt; We're all part of the first and the last Adam. Amen. &gt;&gt; Now in Genesis 1 and 27 we read, "So God created man in his own image. In the image of God created he him. Male and female created he them." So he was a he had a dual personality if you would. He had the attributes of Eve in him. Genesis 2:7. And the Lord God formed man out of the dust of the ground, and he breathed into his nostrils the breath of life, and man became a living soul. And the Lord God planted a garden eastward in Eden, and there he put the man whom he had formed. And I will say to you this morning, and that same God put you here &gt;&gt; and has brought you and allowed you to be in this time, in this season, in this place, in this age, to hear this message, &gt;&gt; not the one I'm preaching, but the message God sent &gt;&gt; by his prophet mouth and which we simply want to uh we simply want to extend that and may God add his blessing to his word. As you have your seats, keep your Bibles open if you would please because I would I I want you not to be distracted by sitting down after we read this next scripture. And it is Matthew 1. And then I want to ask some questions as we just read about three verses here. Matthew the first chapter. And we watch this very close because this will set a tone uh for the service and and bring you right into sharp focus with what I believe God would bring to us. In the 21st verse, this is speaking which a lot of people would have read over Christmas time, but we're not interested in that. This is uh it's always Christmas for us. It's always Easter for us. It's always resurrection and uh we're going to partake in a rapture. &gt;&gt; Now, uh 21st verse, and she shall bring forth a son, and thou shalt call his name Jesus. For he shall save his people from their sins. &gt;&gt; And this next verse is a pillar verse for me in the Bible. Now all this was done. Verse 20, verse 18 says, "Now the birth of Jesus Christ was on this wise." So it gives the details of it. And now in 20 verse 22, it says, "Now all this all this was done." So I'd like to just stop there and have you look this way for a moment. What was done? What is it that was done? Could I say that a young virgin had been selected out of all humanity? Was that done? &gt;&gt; Would you agree? &gt;&gt; Would you agree with me that she had a conception? &gt;&gt; That was done. Would you agree that there was a birth, &gt;&gt; an actual birth took place? And I know that you agree, I'm sure that you agree, that this conception was in the womb of a young woman, young woman that had never known a man. You agree? All this was done that it might be fulfilled. A virgin was chosen. A new a new creation began. &gt;&gt; And the prophet of God said that the words of the prophet the words of the prophet lodged in her womb. Amen. &gt;&gt; Try to get a hold of that in your mind. The words of the prophet lodged in her womb. So what kind of words are those? What kind of force &gt;&gt; is being spoken out of human lips &gt;&gt; that would that would draw on the eternal power of almighty God and lodge those words in the in a womb of a woman and create a seed &gt;&gt; which would be called the beginning of the new creation of God &gt;&gt; that it might be fulfilled which was spoken of the Lord. not spoken of the Lord by the prophet, &gt;&gt; saying, "Behold, a virgin shall conceive and be with child, and shall bring forth a son, and they shall call his name Emmanuel, which being interpreted is God with us." Amen. &gt;&gt; Do you think that Mary, if she began to feel his conception take place and she knew now by the angels visitation that it's it's going to be a boy, she didn't have to have, you know, all the medical apparatus they have today to find out is it a boy, is it a girl. She knew by divine intervention and visitation, you're going to bring forth a son. So she knew that that was a son that she was carrying in her and she's a virgin. She wonders, "How is this going to be? But let it be unto me according to your word and it happened." &gt;&gt; Now I ask you a another question. Was this part of redemption? &gt;&gt; What a part of redemption. She was per a participant in redemption, &gt;&gt; but it was a mystery. Do you think for a moment she realized that this one that's coming forth out of her womb is going to stand before the people and speak words and the people are going to marvel at those words and they would say, "Where has this man learned these letters? Where has he gotten this wisdom? Do you think that she even even passed through her mind that this one that she uh was going to bring forth? Do you think do you think it even even crossed in her wildest imagination that she's going to stand at the foot of a cross and watch this son in the agony of the most cruel death and to see that his phys? &gt;&gt; She never even dreamed of such a thing. &gt;&gt; It never passed through her mind. And that's how mysterious redemption is. Right while redemption, right, while you were being purchased, Mary was standing there, she knew nothing of it and we were being bought. &gt;&gt; Do you think it passed through her mind that when the blood that flowed down out of his body and dripped on the earth, do you think for a moment she realized the whole earth was being purchased? Amen. &gt;&gt; Do you think for a moment that she realized that Satan himself was being defeated and while the blood was dropping and Jesus was claiming the earth that the serpent's head was being crushed? &gt;&gt; I say hallelujah. &gt;&gt; This congregation ought to be able to rejoice. &gt;&gt; Redemption. The mystery of redemption. And it goes on today. And you're part of that mystery. You're part of that redemption. Who ever dreamed that this would that it was going to be this way? And God is going to send a messenger in this end time and speak certain words. And those words are going to be just as creative as the words that created Jesus Christ. Amen. &gt;&gt; Just as creative, &gt;&gt; a virgin then and a virgin now. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And she was a virgin. And the word that she received brought forth a son, as I said last Sunday, that would never take a wife, but would bring forth many more children. &gt;&gt; She was a virgin and received a seed. &gt;&gt; We receive a seed and become a virgin. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; I don't care what kind of life you've had. I don't care what you've experienced. This word &gt;&gt; by this prophet &gt;&gt; will turn you back &gt;&gt; into a virgin sinless state. [Music] &gt;&gt; The only thing that has separated &gt;&gt; Uhhuh. &gt;&gt; mankind within the within the human community. The only thing that has separated man is just one thing only one thing. religion. The world's full of it. &gt;&gt; We say, "Well, there's violent religions and there's uh religions of apathy and religions that are meaningless and religions that are empty." I have nothing to say uh one way or another about religion. I will say this, there's only one thing that separates all humanity. There's one significant thing and that is the people. those that have something in them that is far far more meaningful and has far more influence on them than anything even in their intelligence. It is a seed that God's prophet has called a predestinated seed way down in there. Somehow this God who could bring forth a man from a virgin, he has put a seed in you that would cause you to hear the word, the same God speaking through another prophet's mouth that will turn you back to a virgin condition. &gt;&gt; What can wash away my sin? Nothing but the blood of Jesus Christ. Hallelujah. What can make me whole again? Nothing but the blood of Jesus Christ. And the life that came from that blood, the spirit fell upon the church. And out of the church was raised apostles, prophets, pastors, teachers, and evangelists. And then God has selected certain ones that would be messengers to the age, to the church age, to the Ephesian age, the Philadelphiaian age, the Sardisian age, Thotyron age, and all of these different ages. in Leodysa. Thank God one came to this dark age &gt;&gt; with a word of light, &gt;&gt; with a word of power, &gt;&gt; with a word that can restore you back. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Who doesn't want to hear that kind of news? &gt;&gt; Who wants to live in this world with all of its atrocities, &gt;&gt; injustices, and you think it's ever going to get better? Never. It's sinking into a hopeless spiral &gt;&gt; downward and downward and ever downward. And it finally ends up in a in in a state of judgment in hell. &gt;&gt; And God's going to cleanse it and renovate it to make it a fit place. &gt;&gt; For his children, his people. &gt;&gt; All right. That's the part part of the mystery of redemption. Amen. &gt;&gt; I doubt if there's anyone here that realized when God first laid his hand on you and called you into this word. I doubt if any of you ever dreamed that you'd experience what you've experienced or what you're experiencing now or what we have experienced as a we would never have dreamed that say what should I do don't do anything what was what was Mary to do &gt;&gt; she found herself it it had nothing to do with her it had everything to do with God and and and and things that were simply happening and taking place. I'm sure that there isn't a person here, but what God has allowed you to experience things in your life that you didn't ask for. You didn't plan. You didn't program. You didn't make any you didn't make any preparations for it. It just happened. It just came. It just happened. And you you might say, "Why did this happen in my life?" Or why am I going through this or whatever more? We've had all kinds of things in the individual lives that and there isn't any uh I wouldn't be able to make any uh scenario that would fit everybody. But we all could say that we have experienced those things and we say what should I do? Well, just do one thing. Believe what he has said &gt;&gt; and live by what he has said. &gt;&gt; That is my admonishment to you. That's my counsel to you because that is what separates the believer from the unbeliever, the believer from the makebeliever is believing everything that he said. &gt;&gt; This is not a message smores board &gt;&gt; where we just go and say, "Well, I like this and I like that, but I don't like that and I like that." That's not what it is. When the Passover lamb was sacrificed, they had to eat the lamb. It wasn't just the roast. It wasn't the tenderloin. It was the internal parts and every part, the bitter herbs and all the rest of it was all part of redemption. &gt;&gt; So we have bitter things in our lives. It's part of redemption. &gt;&gt; We have things that are mysterious to us. It's part of redemption. Just stand steadfast. Stand where God has planted your feet. Remain there. Be resolved. This is the direction that God has sent me. This is the word that I believe and nothing can change that. [Music] &gt;&gt; Just a few perhaps thoughts that I had brought to you in the last two three weeks or so concerning redemption. I mentioned to you that from within the first creation, it was a perfect creation. God had already looked on and he said, "It's good. It's very good." But in the midst of that creation, I review this because some of you perhaps weren't here and others that were here. It's good to review it again. But part of that creation, although it was perfect, God, the Bible says God planted afterward, afterward God planted a garden. And that garden was a place for seed because in the midst of that garden was his seed, the tree of life, which was Christ. And he brings forth a man. He's already brought forth. And that's why I read the scripture, the first man. The first man, the first man, Adam was a was actually created in the image of God in the first instance. Created in the image of God, but within him, within that creation was a woman, was a wife and she would be his garden. And God brought her forth out from him. The same as he planted a garden in the creation. Now he has a creation of a man in his image who is reflecting him. Now I haven't spoken that part before. Adam is the son of God reflecting God. God is a God of all creation. God is a God of all the universe. God is God. There is none other beside him. But now God has a son and he gives him the dominion. Have dominion over this earth and over this creation. name the animals and speak the word and do whatever uh you are led to do. And he said that he the prophet of God said he led the animals as as the Holy Spirit leads the church today. What uh what a man this first Adam was. But he was reflecting God on the earth. He was a reflection of God because every son is a reflection of his father. And in God his attributes in God is seed. In Adam was seed. &gt;&gt; And now God brings forth Adam and from Adam brings forth Eve. And she's a place where his seeds are planted. And before he got there, because Satan, now hang on to this because I'm going to come back to it. Satan cannot create. He can only pervert what has been created. &gt;&gt; He is not a creator. And in fact, as the prophet of God in instructed us that he was co-equal with God and only only in creation, that's why that's why Isaiah speaks of I'll ascend. I'll ascend to the stars of God. I'll ascend to the mount of God because there was something that he couldn't yet do and it was creation that he couldn't do. So, he comes down in Eden. Why didn't he come before? And you've heard me say this many times. Satan was cast to the earth because of his disobedience. Because iniquity was found in his heart. Why did he why did he arrive in Eden? Just the garden. It wasn't just creation. It wasn't just at the time when the creation was done that Lucifer was found. But he comes to Eden. Why does he come to Eden? Because it's a place of seed sowing &gt;&gt; and he can't create he can't create a serpent. And this upright being this very fine being who had been cast out. Serpent wasn't a snake, folks. &gt;&gt; The serpent wasn't a snake. He was cast down. God God completely destroyed the whole structure of his body. &gt;&gt; He was cast down. The Bible says above all the animals. So he was above them. You can't be cast down below them if you weren't above them. &gt;&gt; So, he was cast down lower than all the animals because he was above them. He was a creature. Hey, he was a creature God talked to. &gt;&gt; He was a creature that could speak back. &gt;&gt; He was a creature that knew what God said. &gt;&gt; Hath God said? He was a extremely intelligent and perhaps even finer looking physically than Adam himself? We do not know. But he spoke to Eve. He enticed Eve. He beguiled her through his subility. He had seed &gt;&gt; and the people looked for a missing link and that was him. &gt;&gt; Because that is the one that God cursed out of existence. &gt;&gt; Science looks for the missing link. There's some missing link. There's some link between human and animal because they know that man is an animal, a mammal in that sense of the word. But he was cursed out of existence and they'll never find him. &gt;&gt; God changed his entire structure. But prior to that, Satan took a hold of that instrument. He couldn't create him, but he could pervert him. and he took it and swed his seed in the garden of Eve &gt;&gt; and brought forth a Cain &gt;&gt; who would stand in the face of God and lie in the face of God and speak and rebel in the face of God. Think what kind of uh uh you talk about two vines there they start &gt;&gt; man who had murder in his heart. &gt;&gt; Yes sir. So when God, the prophet said in the cruelty of sin. So when God made his first man, I gave you this quote before he was a spirit man. He was something on the order of God or the son of God, the logos. That was the first man. Then he gave the man jurisdiction over to lead all the animal life just like the Holy Spirit leads the believer today. &gt;&gt; Amen. And out of Adam he said, Because thou hast hearkened unto the voice of thy wife, and hast eaten of the tree of which I commanded thee, saying, Thou shalt not eat of it. Cursed is the ground for thy sake. In sorrow shalt thou eat of it all the days of thy life. &gt;&gt; Amen. Therefore, Genesis 3:23, therefore the Lord God sent him forth from the Garden of Eden to till the ground. This is really striking and very sad. And God sent him forth from the garden. I I don't want to take the time, but when you think of a God that had the capacity to feel what our God, the love that he had for the world and for the earth and for the he loves his creation and his son, how he must have just had such an intense love upon his son and now his son's bride and now he had put them in this garden and now he's driving them boat and he sent the fourth out of the garden to till the ground. Go to work. I had put you here just to tend to the garden to keep it and to dress it. Go out now to work amongst the thorns and the thistles and the storms and everything that will come. And so he drove the man out. Amen. &gt;&gt; He drove out the man and he placed at the east of the garden of Eden cherubams, &gt;&gt; angels and a flaming sword. Now another dimension comes into existence. Now it's not just uh the things that are there physically in the creation. But now there's another dimension that is introduced and that's cherubams. Angels are going to be uh east of Eden. uh cherubams and a flaming sword which turned every way to keep the way of the tree of life. And the prophet said Jesus when he came then he said I'm the way. &gt;&gt; He was the one that was being kept the way. It wasn't they weren't protecting Jesus. They weren't protecting the tree of life. They were protecting the way of the tree of life. Uh Adam lost his way. Now he didn't know. He didn't have the same range of intelligence he had just prior to this. Now he's reduced. He's he's fallen. &gt;&gt; He's a fallen man. And they don't know what to do. Things are happening. Soon they have murder on their hands and they've got bloodshed and they've got hatred and they have everything. And he lives all these years, centuries of years. I think 930 years Adam lived or 950 right up in there. and and and now he's been driven out of the garden of Eden. Now there was a need for redemption. &gt;&gt; Now, now there was a need for redemption. And brother Brandham said, "Adam, he could not meet the requirements of redemption. He found after he found he lost it. You know, I I know what it's about a little bit. When you're as time passes and those of you that have a few years, those of you that young, I have news for you. There'll be a time when you won't be able to do quite what you used to do before. I used to work for a fellow. I was I was 15 years old. And I was on a farm and the old fella, he was a bachelor and he had two brothers. They were all bachelors. They came from Ireland. They all came became wealthy and he had so much land. He didn't know how much land. He didn't know how many head of cattle he had. He didn't know how many horses. They were just out there producing year after year after year. And he had broke horses and rode horses and and got bucked off of horses until he was kind of bent over and around, you know, and he he would try and encourage us younger fellas to do different things. Oh, it was a case. He was a case. And and then he'd talk on into the night. We had to stop answering him or he'd just keep talking. And they were in this old log house of his and dark and you know bunk house type of a house and and just live like bachelors. I mean you know let's say no more. And I'd lay on this cot and listen to him go on and on. He'd talk about this story and that story and these horses he had and these he sold and these he broke and everyone every time he'd tell a story about these horses, you know, cuz he had hundreds of them and he'd talk about one and he broke this horse and there he was all crippled up and his legs all stiff and he says, "And I can still do it. I can still do it." And I think in his mind he thought he could still do it. So we'd say to him, you know, and I've thought quite a bit about this because now I'm at a place where I can't really do everything I used to do. And and so I I still inside I still think I can still do it. You know, I guess some of these things are humorous, but my wife says, she says to me, I need the top of the, you know, the fan. I need the top of it dusted off. So I said, okay, get a rag, you know. So this is nothing. I'm just going to get up here and do this. This is this is just a piece of cake. So I start getting up there and even her words to me now be careful. So that kind of put a caution on me. Maybe this isn't as easy as I thought. You know, you get in a chair and you start to jiggle a wee bit. I thought this is ridiculous. I can do this, but you know, you find out you got to just be a little bit more careful. And I got thinking of old Joe Clark. I I can still do it. He was all crippled up. So, you know what we'd say? Well, well, we got some horses out here, Joe. Let Why don't we do it? Go out there and break them. But, you know, he never took us up because deep, deep, deep, deep down, I thought he knew he still couldn't do it. He had finally arrived there. &gt;&gt; And you know what? It kind of dawns on you. I I I can I can't quite do it. Adam. That's what I believe it was with Adam. He began to realize he couldn't quite do it. He thought, "I should be able to handle this. Why aren't these animals listening to me? Why isn't I'm speaking to this tree? Why isn't it doing what it did before? How come I don't have that same power?" I think the same thing happened with Samson because the Bible says he wished not &gt;&gt; that the spirit of God had left him. And so, friends, when the spirit of God lifts, people don't stop worshiping. They don't stop having church. And brother Baron says after the bride is gone, &gt;&gt; they'll still have church &gt;&gt; and they'll still have altar calls and people will come and think they're getting saved. &gt;&gt; Hey, you have a whole nation over there called Israel. They don't believe that Jesus came. They don't believe he died for the sins of the world. They don't believe he was virgin born. They don't believe any of this that you and I believe. They don't believe the New Testament. They don't have the New Testament. They can read it, but they don't believe it. And if you went over there and said, "You're lost. You think they believe you?" No. We know, of course, they're blinded, &gt;&gt; but if you went over there and said, "You're blinded so we could come in." They'd say, "Get out of here. We don't have anything to we we don't want to hear that. So they have lost something, &gt;&gt; but they don't realize it. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; And so here's what happened. And he sinned and he separated himself from God. And I love these words even though they're sad. And the prophet says they separated themselves. He separated himself from God. Was on this side of the chasm. Brother Brandham was saying he was on this side of the chasm here in this life. Oh friends, I hope I'm able to convey myself to you. I'm so glad that he came through redemption &gt;&gt; and bridged away to the other side of the chasm. &gt;&gt; I don't I have no intention on staying on this human side of the chasm. We have believed now in a supernatural. But Adam found himself on this side of the chasm and it was a chasm. So he could not redeem it. It took redemption to reach the other side. He just couldn't do it because he needed redemption himself. &gt;&gt; How could he redeem when he needed redemption himself? in the restoration of the bride tree. Speaking of Christ, he was God's prophet tree. &gt;&gt; I love the language because it it fits so much in what I've been ministering. He preached all the perfect word of God. For he was the word of God made manifest. He was the perfect prophet tree that preached the perfect prophet word that brought forth the perfect prophet fruit by the perfect word of God. Did you ever hear such things as that? He was a perfect prophet tree. He was a tree who spoke the perfect prophet word and brought forth the perfect prophet fruit by the perfect word of God. Thank God for Isaiah one day who cried out, "Behold, a virgin shall conceive." And that perfect prophet word brought forth a perfect prophet fruit. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Called the son of the living God. Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Are you following me? I'm sure you are. &gt;&gt; And now the prophet of God in this generation, he's he's he's tying back. He's putting his anchor back there and he's bringing it forward to this day because he knows that it's not him. He knows it's the same God speaking through his lips. That's why he could say so many times, not me speaking. That's my voice, but that's not me speaking. I don't know what I said, but that was him speaking. You can hear it. That happened in our time. I say to you, do you believe that's the truth? Do you believe that was God speaking? Do you believe it was God taking this word that the world is so confused over and speaking it so you could understand it and speaking it so you could have a revelation? I say, open up your ears, open up your heart, open up your mind, and yield to the Holy Spirit. Exactly. &gt;&gt; God's perfect prophet word &gt;&gt; to bring forth a perfect prophet fruit. &gt;&gt; Not fruit of a denomination, not fruit of a church, not a fruit of a man's idea, but I want to bring forth and you must bring forth fruit of thus sayaith the Lord. &gt;&gt; Thus saith the Lord. That's what separates all humanity. Glory to God. He said, "Oh, brother, what a tree." He was that life tree that the angel kept Eve and Adam away from &gt;&gt; with the guarding cherubams away from that tree. Now the same cherubams &gt;&gt; the same cherubams &gt;&gt; is trying to run them into it &gt;&gt; because there's been a way made for them. &gt;&gt; He's making an announcement. He's an announcement messenger. He's an announcement prophet. This that you have read about. It is now here present. There has been a way already made a way for them. Prior to that, perhaps there wasn't a way like there is now across the chasm. There's a way. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And you that have crossed the chasm and crossed this uh marvelous bridge from humanity &gt;&gt; to eternity. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. friends &gt;&gt; my holding myself back &gt;&gt; because there's been a way made in Christ the mystery of God revealed he said he's that seed the woman's seed the tree of life in the garden he's all of those he's the seed the woman's seed what was in Eve &gt;&gt; what was in uh Mary was in Eden &gt;&gt; you see it's just different layers of the same thing he's a tree there he's a child here. He's a man here. He's a king of kings. He's a lord of lords. He's all of that. It's the same one. &gt;&gt; We We don't have a whole uh myriad of gods. We have one God. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Manifested &gt;&gt; in Christ Jesus, reconciling the world to himself, redeeming you and I. The same God. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; He's the woman's seed. Amen. &gt;&gt; He's the tree in the garden. &gt;&gt; And unless they put forth their hands and and and move this tree, they'd eat that tree and live forever. And he's the only tree that can be taken that you can live forever. &gt;&gt; He's the only tree. And he's the word. &gt;&gt; He's the word. &gt;&gt; He's He's only He's not just words. He is the word. &gt;&gt; And the word is this. Listen, friends, it's so simple. Even while a prophet of God, while all the messengers were here, while Apostle Paul was here, while Jesus was here, there is one distinction between them all and the rest of humanity. And that is this. When they spoke, God moved in behind it and performed vindicated their words by the supernatural taking place. I just read uh and and brother Brandon was preaching early in the 1950s in Eerie, Pennsylvania. It's Eeries, Pennsylvania. Is that right? He m he he go he makes in one paragraph it would just absolutely stun any scientist's word any sci scientist's mind or any medical mind or any religious mind he was just so far out there and letting the people know &gt;&gt; that this is no more history &gt;&gt; this same God that you believed in I'll prove to you he's here right now &gt;&gt; what what kind of a a vessel is that he have such absolute assurance that that God is going to move on the scene in the next few moments and prove that what he's saying is absolutely the truth. &gt;&gt; Friends, here I stand here today with you joining hearttoheart and saying this messenger we believe. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; This word we believe. &gt;&gt; And that's what separates humanity. &gt;&gt; And that's all you're called on to do. Believe it. Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; You're not even called on to produce certain things. The word itself will produce it. &gt;&gt; He said he was put on a tree of disgrace. Cursed is he that hung on a tree became a curse for the human race. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And now through that he brings forth a bride tree. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Who ever dreamed? Did Mary think while she stood at the foot of the cross, "Oh, how wonderful. A bride tree is coming forth." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Did she think for a moment, humanity is being redeemed? &gt;&gt; Did anyone, even the prophets, the most holy and the most righteous, or the disciples that have been called, do you think anyone even realized this is God's rest? God rested on the seventh day. His work was finished. But he left the law. Says, "The day you eat thereof, that day you die." &gt;&gt; And he put a judgment on the earth and a curse on the earth. &gt;&gt; Can you comprehend with me? Do you think Mary compre? Do you think we comprehend it that as she stood there, here's a rugged tree, here's blood, here's two other male factors, here's the people, and they're wagging their head and they're saying, "Ah, come down from the cross. You that said, uh, I I will destroy the temple and raise it up in three days. Do that and we'll believe. Come down from the cross and we'll believe." And and both of the male factors and I believe it was brother Tom was mentioning that only one of them he saw something different but both of them were railing on him. The Bible says railing on him. Do something. You're a miracle worker. Bring us down. Come down from the cross and bring us down. &gt;&gt; Do you think they thought for a moment? Do you think anybody realized that the judgment of God &gt;&gt; was being satisfied? the justice of all a holy righteous creator. His justice was being satisfied. Do you think for a moment that they could realize no one who believes on him will ever have to suffer a penalty of sin? The whole penalty is being paid now. The justice of God is being paid now. And God entered into his rest. And if God could enter into his rest with that work, surely you and I can enter into that rest. &gt;&gt; Say, "Satan puts guilt on your mind. Satan brings condemnation on your mind. You deny him. He has no right to do it. If you're called of the Holy Spirit, God and Jesus Christ died for you, paid the penalty for you, completely paid the penalty, and you are not you're not only free, you're guiltless. &gt;&gt; Do you believe it? &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; What a tree. He said through the woman in natural birth we die but through the man the man &gt;&gt; we live such powerful things you won't hear this &gt;&gt; where else will you hear such statements through the woman we die &gt;&gt; through your mother he said we die. There isn't a human that comes by a sexual natural birth, but what you are destined to die &gt;&gt; if the nature of your birth destines you to a death. &gt;&gt; But now comes another voice. &gt;&gt; Now comes another word. &gt;&gt; The same the same God who spoke through Isaiah said, "A virgin shall conceive." And those words anchored in her womb. And they anchored in her womb for the express purpose for the express purpose of fulfilling that prophet's words &gt;&gt; because they were not the words of a man. They were the words of God. &gt;&gt; And you get this settled in your heart. When you read the messages, when you hear it, it will have a completely different connotation to you. You read it, you'll realize this is not a man speaking. A man couldn't say these kind of things. This is almighty God. And whether it has happened or it's going to happen, it certainly will happen because God word will never fail. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; All that lived by the woman die. All that's born by the man lives. &gt;&gt; All that comes by the woman in natural is natural. All that comes from the man is spiritual. Not the man here but the man Christ Jesus. &gt;&gt; So I said we all are part of the first Adam and the last Adam. You have been sown. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; In this earth we are we have different backgrounds, different ethnic groups. We're very multicultural. We are we have different cultures. We have learned different languages. We have different ways of doing things. We are made up different. Some love mountains, some love prairie, some love sunshine. I hope you all love rain. Anyway, that's what we have. And we we we're very very different. And we like things. And we like different kinds of foods. And you like food I can't stand. and I perhaps eat food you can't stand. And and we're all very very different. As long as we have one thing in common, &gt;&gt; we have the same intense love &gt;&gt; for God's word. &gt;&gt; What God spoke. &gt;&gt; And we have that in common. And we're all on common ground. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen. &gt;&gt; There are seven names of God. I have a list. I don't have it here. I have it in another file, but I have 100 names for Jesus Christ. It's unbelievable. And quite frankly, there's more names for Satan than perhaps you realize. It would shock you. the devil, Satan, Lucifer, the adversary, all these names. There's a whole string of them, perhaps 50 or more, &gt;&gt; but there's a hundred for Jesus Christ. At least a hundred and perhaps more. That's marvelous. And the amazing thing is the the same Bible that gives those titles to him gives almost the same ones to you as the bride of Jesus Christ, the body of Jesus Christ, the spotless one, the the great host without number. It goes on and on and on. We have so many. But there are seven and the brother Brandham calls them the seven redemptive names of Jehovah. And I think of this now in terms of redemption. Redeemed. Redeemed. Oh, I love to proclaim it in terms of redemption. Friends, if we don't participate in redemption, we're on the wrong side of the chasm. And if there's anyone here, the greatest thing we could do as a congregation today would be to invite somebody who's on the other side of the chasm. Come over here. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; There has been a way made for you. Don't stay there where there's sure destruction and sure darkness. Don't stay there. &gt;&gt; I mean, do you mind me lifting my voice and crying out? &gt;&gt; Come over to this side of the chasm. [Applause] &gt;&gt; There's no tree of life over there. &gt;&gt; There's no eternal life over there. Don't stay there. &gt;&gt; Look at the world you live in. Look at the people you have to rub shoulders with. Look at the things the people humanity feeds on. Do you want that to be your diet? Do you want that to be your future? I say no. No, no. If you're a seed of God, there's something in here that's calling out [Music] &gt;&gt; seven re redemptive names. Jehovah. He's Jehovah Gyra. The Lord will provide. And brother Brandham says, "The Lord will provide a sacrifice." And after each one of these, I want the congregation to say, "Redemption." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Jehovah Gyra. The Lord will provide. &gt;&gt; He's Jehovah Rafa. Think about this now. The Lord that healeth thee. &gt;&gt; Redemption. He's Jehovah Nissi, the Lord our banner. &gt;&gt; Redemption. &gt;&gt; He is Jehovah Shalom, &gt;&gt; the Lord our peace. &gt;&gt; Redemption. &gt;&gt; He's Jehovah Raha, the Lord my shepherd. &gt;&gt; Redemption. He's Jehovah Sidkanu, the Lord our righteousness. &gt;&gt; Redemption. And he's Jehovah Shama. The Lord is present. &gt;&gt; Redemption. [Applause] &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham gave those in a message and he said, "I want to take the first one and the last one." &gt;&gt; And he said, "I want to speak on the last one." &gt;&gt; Oh, that was his that was his message. That was what he was sent to the earth to say. the last of the seven uh descriptive names of Jesus in in Revelation the first chapter. He saw his eyes and his garment and his hair and his eyes as a flame of fire and his his hair glistening white and his garment glistening and his feet as brass that burned in the furnace. But the last description of him was his countenance, his face. Because when the Bible speaks of his face or the face of a person, he's present &gt;&gt; and you're looking at each other. &gt;&gt; It's not a crowd you're looking at, but you're right together and you're looking right in his face. His ministry was to bring you face to face. &gt;&gt; His ministry was to speak about Jehovah Shyama. &gt;&gt; The Lord is present. &gt;&gt; He's not 150 million light years up in space. He's not in some distant country. He's as close as your breath. &gt;&gt; If you could believe that, nothing is impossible in this service today. &gt;&gt; There isn't a sickness, there isn't a disease, there isn't a need that a person could have if you can grasp Jehovah Shama. &gt;&gt; Not only is he present, this is part of my redemption. &gt;&gt; Oh, I feel, you have to forgive me. I feel incredibly inspired and moved by the Holy Spirit to bring this to you. &gt;&gt; When they say the Lord is present, it doesn't mean that this person has it or that person has it or the preacher has it or someone who you know is highly visible has it. No, the person who doesn't hardly say anything and maybe is is scarcely seen or heard is very present to you. &gt;&gt; Redemption is paramount in the mind of God. So much so that Jesus Christ, who's the theme of the entire scripture, &gt;&gt; he's he is the redeemer. &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham calls Isaiah the book of Isaiah, and I'm sure you've all heard this many times before, but we'll repeat it once again. Isaiah is a commentary of the entire Bible. &gt;&gt; Amen. The book of Isaiah has 66 chapters and the Bible has 66 books. Isaiah starts off with the creation in a sense about the middle of the book you find John the Baptist and at the end of the book you find the millennium. &gt;&gt; Amen. Isaiah has said these things and I will just tell you as a matter of interest 18 times in the Bible God is spoken of as redeemer 13 of those times are in the book of Isaiah. I would say that that is telling us something. Isaiah who's writing a commentary of the Bible, his his his whole book is seasoned with he's a redeemer. He's a redeemer. He's a redeemer. And it's not Isaiah saying it. It's God saying it. And then I just have a few of them. Thus sayeth the Lord. Isaiah 44 and6. Thus sayith the Lord, the King of Israel and his redeemer, the Lord of hosts. I'm the first and I'm the last. And beside me there is no other God. &gt;&gt; Amen. We can say amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's the kind of redeemer I want. &gt;&gt; Isaiah 44:24, "Thus saith the Lord thy redeemer, and he that formed thee from the womb." We've all been formed from the womb. This is a message to you from Isaiah. Thus sayaith the Lord your redeemer. &gt;&gt; And he that formed you in the womb. You came as a part of the first Adam. But this is the one who's speaking to you. He is also the God who brings forth the redeemer, the tree of life, the living word that will transport you and does has transported us to the other side of the chasm. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That formed thee from the womb. I am the Lord that maketh all things that stretcheth forth the heavens alone that spreadth abroad the earth by myself. Isaiah 54 and5 for thy maker is thine husband. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen. &gt;&gt; Can you sit quiet? &gt;&gt; Here he is speaking. Thy maker. &gt;&gt; He's thy husband. &gt;&gt; Oh, I'm glad I got a husband to take care of us. &gt;&gt; I'm glad I had a husband who said, "I'm Jehovah Gyra. I'm the one that provides." &gt;&gt; Glory. &gt;&gt; Glory. &gt;&gt; The Lord of hosts is his name. and thy redeemer, the Holy One of Israel, the God of the whole earth, shall he be called? &gt;&gt; He's the God of the whole earth. He's your redeemer. He's your husband. He's your maker. He's everything. Oh, he's everything. He's everything to me. [Applause] &gt;&gt; Isaiah 54:8. In a little while, in a little wrath, oh, I'm so glad it was just a little wrath. I hid my face from thee for a moment, &gt;&gt; but with everlasting kindness, not with everlasting wrath, but with everlasting kindness, will I have mercy on thee, says the Lord, thy redeemer. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Let the church of the living God rejoice in such a glorious promise. Amen. &gt;&gt; It's been the theme of the church. The prophet said, &gt;&gt; "It's been its outlook. It's been its heart. &gt;&gt; The earth's bathed with the blood of his kinsman redeemer to redeem Adam's fallen race." &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; In the breach. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He said, "This seven sealed book now &gt;&gt; is the mystery of redemption." &gt;&gt; And that was my message. &gt;&gt; Amen. the mystery of redemption. &gt;&gt; It's unfolding even now. And I trust you'll see things even in the in the word that's being ministered today. Say, "Oh my, it it I perhaps I've heard it before, but it never really took hold down all down through the scripture. the different stages and phases of this redemption and I won't even get into it or we won't get done I want to come to a very important part very important part when we come to the breach I've been speaking about don't think the breach is a message &gt;&gt; the breach is actually an act &gt;&gt; the same as Mary conceived in her womb &gt;&gt; the breach is an is an event &gt;&gt; and The event is the prophet is is announcing that Boaz is coming. &gt;&gt; And now when he takes the book and your name is in the book, &gt;&gt; he's laying claim to you. &gt;&gt; And I want to say to each one of you, I'd like to sit across the table and look into your face and into your eyes. Every single believer, you have been claimed. &gt;&gt; You are not your own. You've been claimed. Oh, I'm so glad he claimed me. Because we all were in the devil's &gt;&gt; we had a mortgage on our lives. &gt;&gt; We were in the devil's pawn shop. &gt;&gt; And we've been claimed out. &gt;&gt; And the Lord Jesus Christ came with the ticket &gt;&gt; and said, "They're mine. &gt;&gt; I bought them. &gt;&gt; He's a mighty man of wealth. He's the Boaz." And he took you out of the pawn shop. &gt;&gt; And the prophet of God said, "You can't be in it and out of it at the same time. We're either in it or we're out of it." And I want How many can rejoice and say, "I'm out of the pawn shop. &gt;&gt; I'm out of it. &gt;&gt; I've been purchased. I know that I'm out of it. It's already taken place. &gt;&gt; He has no claim on me. &gt;&gt; God through Jesus Christ has claimed me." And he actually sent a messenger down in this time. And to read those scriptures and to say, "It's now here." &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. This is not history, friends. This is present. &gt;&gt; If I'm beside myself, just leave me this way. &gt;&gt; He said, "These seven seals got the mysteries of God from the foundation of the world all sealed up in there &gt;&gt; and revealed by seven different seals. There the mystery of redemption is sealed. &gt;&gt; In other words, there had to be part of the mystery of redemption. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That had to be made known. &gt;&gt; It has to be preached. &gt;&gt; It has to be received into your heart, into your mind, and into your heart and soul. &gt;&gt; It needs to come down that one channel. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Have adult minds now. &gt;&gt; The one channel which is the channel down to the soul. Amen. &gt;&gt; One channel, five channels of the body, five channels of your spirit, memory and imagination and conscience and and affection and reasoning. &gt;&gt; All of those channels to the spirit emotional man. You know, I just throw this in and just pray that I'll find where I kind left off. I was studying this and I have said repeated many times and I wish I could take you to one of brother Ben's meetings right now where there were thousands of people and I sat in at least 30 of the meetings and I've seen him stand little small humble man and he just I could I could see that his his he would change. And we had been told and instructed he will do nothing. He cannot speak. He cannot. There's no ability. He said, "I'm just your brother." But when the angel of the Lord came, &gt;&gt; he'd just say like this, "He's here." &gt;&gt; Quite often he'd raise the same hand and he'd say, "I now take every spirit, &gt;&gt; Amen, &gt;&gt; of every person under my control." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; For the glory of God. He say, "Where's the first person? Where's the first patient?" And there were people who were friends of mine who he had never laid eyes on in his life. What would you do if you're sitting like where I was, where brother Tom is, and he's standing there, and a woman is standing here, old family friend of my family. He's standing about about as far as from the piano. He said, "Um, you're not here for yourself. You're here because you're praying for a man." And that man does not live in this city. He lives in a place just north from here. And I believe it's called Fort St. John. For those you British Columbians, you know where that is. is about 700 miles north and he said that man is shattered by death and he's dying with cancer and just told her to pray or to believe and and and she would go. The next morning, I'm in the car with brother Brandham driving to a location about 400 miles away up the Alaskan Highway and he doesn't know where I'm taking him. And that Alaskan highway when the US Army put it in, it goes right through some farmer's fields and they built the little village and finally became a town and now is a city called Fort St. John. and a bypass went right through a farmer's yard and a big old white house sitting maybe a couple hundred yards or meters off to the road and I often saw that house and then motel and gas stations build up all along the highway but that house that old farmhouse always stayed there and we're just driving by we're relaxed now the meetings are over brother Brandham's just in his dungarees his jeans little cowboy hat on and he's driving I'm sitting beside him brother Chris Berg is in the back seat And brother Bam's driving and we had to slow down because there just 30 mph speed limit there. He slows right down. Then he he just changed a wee bit. He says, "There was a woman praying for a man from Fort St. John. He was dying with cancer." I said, "Yes, Brother Brandham. Her name is Sister Clint. She's a very dear friend of my family." He just went like this. And that and because he was driving and we were passing by. He just went like this behind my head. He went behind my head. He says the man's in that house. &gt;&gt; You might say like I said, and you can say, "Shame on me for that." I said, "How do I know he's in the house?" Do you know why you say that? Because the devil is present. &gt;&gt; And I was just a babe. Even though I was ministering, been preaching for seven years, I we didn't know anything about the message and I had all kinds of questions and wonderments and I thought and I thought it wasn't my thought. It just flashed through my mind. How do I know he's in that house? Now I knew the woman on the platform. I knew her well. I knew now we're in Fort St. John and here's the house. He's identifying this old farmhouse 375 miles up the road. We stopped at brother Southwick's who was going to take us out hunting and take him out for a rest. And I want to tell brother Bud what kind of a man, what kind of a ministry, what, you know, because he knew nothing. He'd given his life to Christ, but he knew nothing about the Bible. Nothing. &gt;&gt; So I said, "Brother brother Bud, you know, he's he's a prophet." And I said, you know, on the platform, this is what happened. And when we're driving up the highway, I said, "We're slowing down. Fort St. John is on the right hand side. And I said, and he points, he says, "The man's in that house." Brother Bud says, "And Bud had been b born and raised in Fort St. John." He said, "Well, that's right." He said, "I know him." And he gave me his name. He says, "I also know he's dying with cancer." So now here, you wonder why I speak with such intensity? Because I'm so determined to cause people to believe it. There it was on the platform with the woman I knew that I knew he had never seen. There it was on the highway driving past the house. The man's in the house. There it is with my almost lifelong friend, brother Southwick. He says, "Yes, I know the man. I know he's dying with cancer. How could I disbelieve? &gt;&gt; How could I disbelieve?" &gt;&gt; And then who has that kind of intelligence? Where does it come from? It's divine. &gt;&gt; It come from God. Then you begin to believe and see that God is speaking through the mouth. And you begin to hear it over and over and over again thousands of times. Not in a corner, &gt;&gt; throughout the whole earth, &gt;&gt; seven times around the world. &gt;&gt; Why am I saying that? Why am I emphasizing that? Is so that when he begins to speak about your redemption that you will believe it with the same intensity. When he begins to say, "We're on the other side of the chasm. We're not in that confusion anymore." You'll believe it. When he'll say, "You're not church anymore. I call you bride." That you'll believe it. &gt;&gt; When he say when he says, "We're not going to the wedding. We're married here. We're going to the marriage supper." That you'll believe it with the same intensity. And by believing it, friends, it will happen. I'm not asking how you feel today. You can feel as dead as this pullpit. But if you'll believe the word, that word has life in it. And that's the same word, the same word that created a seed in the womb of a virgin. &gt;&gt; And it'll turn you back, virgin. &gt;&gt; Untouched. [Applause] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Can I have a few more minutes? Amen. &gt;&gt; So now I say in the name of the Lord, you are part &gt;&gt; of this mystery of redemption. &gt;&gt; The process of redemption is taking place. And brother Brandham in the breach and this is the part I want to come to and then I'm going to close. He goes to the book of Ruth and it would it would do you well after this service go to the book of Ruth and read it. It's only four chapter four four chapters. Powerful &gt;&gt; and in the breach that is the breach. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; In and that is revelation five. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; In revelation five he as kinsman redeemer. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The lamb. &gt;&gt; The lamb. Not the king. The lamb. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Stood. Not the priest and not the prophet. The lamb. &gt;&gt; He came. See, apostle uh John the Baptist rather when he saw Jesus, they were cousins after the flesh, after the first Adam, they were cousins. But in the plan of God, they one was a prophet and the other was a god of the prophets. &gt;&gt; And he had revelation cuz he's a prophet. So he says, "Behold the lamb of God that takes away the sin of the world." &gt;&gt; What a statement. &gt;&gt; What a statement. The sin of the world. What a revelation. &gt;&gt; How many believed him? I would say very few if any. &gt;&gt; And he probably scarcely could he probably scarcely could fathom his own words. &gt;&gt; Behold the lamb of God that takes away the sin of the world. And I can see the people saying, "Oh yeah, they're cousins." &gt;&gt; Oh yeah, they've got something hatched up &gt;&gt; like some have said. so ignorantly. &gt;&gt; Oh yeah, Tom Ray, he he he's a son-in-law. &gt;&gt; That's God. I didn't have any idea he was ever going to preach the gospel. &gt;&gt; We have That's not That's not man's choosing. That's God's calling. And if you don't have a call, you just can't do it. &gt;&gt; Oh yeah, that's quite a thing hatched up. They're two they're cousins. &gt;&gt; And he's putting them forward as some great one. Behold the lamb of God that takes away the sin of the world. &gt;&gt; What a statement. &gt;&gt; But it wasn't man speaking. It was God speaking through the man. &gt;&gt; It was the spirit of Elijah speaking. &gt;&gt; Do you believe it was the spirit of Elijah? And the spirit of Elijah Malachi 4 spoke again in this time to turn your heart back to the faith of the father. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And so now he's commissioned to speak the opening of the seven seals. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; By the angels of God that descended, &gt;&gt; allowed science to take a picture of it. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Allowed me as a young man to sit in an audience when that picture was first shown and a gasp went over the people. Brother Bradom just said, "This is the way it is in the Life magazine." &gt;&gt; He says, "They have it the wrong way. They just need to turn it to the right." &gt;&gt; And when he did, the people gasped and I gasped. &gt;&gt; Said, "Who is this?" Jesus. &gt;&gt; He's the wicked one with white wig on. He's coming as the judge. &gt;&gt; And he sends his messenger, "Go and speak the opening of the seals. Seven angels with seven seals to be open. a message to the end time to us [Music] &gt;&gt; and he comes to speak and before he speaks he comes to the breach &gt;&gt; and he says in in in a message I'm just going all over the map now he says in the message that the Old Testament you see the Old Testament and the New Testament 's husband and wife. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; All right. It's like Christ and his bride. &gt;&gt; All right. At the end of the Old Testament, which is here comes Jesus Christ. And between this page, I hate to do this with my new Bible, but between this page and this page is 400 and some years. And there was no prophet during that 400 years. &gt;&gt; And this closing of this prophet's mouth, he says, "Behold, &gt;&gt; I will send you." &gt;&gt; Elijah the prophet before the great and terrible day of the Lord. His first coming was great. His last coming is terrible. &gt;&gt; He came with to pay the price for redemption the first time. He comes the last time to claim his own and bring judgment to the sin cursed earth. Amen. &gt;&gt; Oh my brother, when the world's on fire, &gt;&gt; don't you want to be in God's bosom? &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Thank you. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Don't you want to be in God's bosom? I said, &gt;&gt; I do. &gt;&gt; I'll send you Elijah the prophet and he'll turn the heart. And this prophet said the Old Testament. Now I said this was husband and wife. Eve, this is the wife. So Eve was hidden in Adam. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Nobody knew anything about her. &gt;&gt; She was hidden or concealed in Adam. &gt;&gt; When she came out was brought out. &gt;&gt; Amen. Brother Brandham said the woman is given to the man so he can reflect himself. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And so now his garden is there and he can sew his seed. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And he Adam reflects himself. And the perverted one Cain did not reflect the son of God. So she had another seed. And the scripture says, "And God appointed her another seed." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Enos. And then Seth or Seth and whichever. Now he has a seed that reflect him. &gt;&gt; And we have the two vines &gt;&gt; and they're here today. &gt;&gt; They're here with us today. So now the messenger comes and he says the Old Testament. So Naomi in the book of Ruth and I have to go very quickly and I only want to take another five minutes or so. And so Naomi in the book of Ruth, he goes to Naomi says she's the old Orthodox church. She's the old Jewish church. &gt;&gt; Amen. and she's got a gentile with her and the two there was Ruth and Orpha but Ruth was had been married but her husband could bring no seed to her and so she had brought forth no children &gt;&gt; so she was childless a widowed childless woman and she she follows Ruth and there's wonderful words She follows Naomi rather and it's words that are used in weddings and so on and so forth and by the world. Your God will be my God. Your people will be my people. Where you live, I'll live. And where you die, I'll die. And all of these wonderful words. It's a lot more than that. But now a prophet comes and gives it completely different and new meaning. Says that's the old Hebrew church. And and now comes Boaz who was a near kinsman to her and to Naomi. And in redeeming the old Hebrew church, he gets a gentile bride &gt;&gt; because she came with her. &gt;&gt; And Naomi's aged now. And Ruth goes to the field. And the Bible says it haps it happened that she lighted in Boaz's field. &gt;&gt; And what does Jesus say the field is? fulfilled as the world. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It It just so happened &gt;&gt; that you arrived here in the world. &gt;&gt; It just so happened that you arrived at this present time. &gt;&gt; It just so happened that you arrived in this church today. And it didn't just so happen. It's no accident. It's a design of almighty God to hear. And God wanted you to hear what you're hearing today. And God wants that word not to come into your ears, but to go down the channel into the soul. &gt;&gt; God wants to pregnant you &gt;&gt; with the life of this word. &gt;&gt; You women that have born children, &gt;&gt; for a while it's a mystery. &gt;&gt; For a while it's a secret. &gt;&gt; For a while no one even knows. and you have kind of a Mona Lisa smile on your face. &gt;&gt; You know something no one else knows. Then your husband perhaps gets to know the secret with you. And then you keep the secret. But finally, eventually the life begins to show. &gt;&gt; Finally, eventually you can't hide it any longer. &gt;&gt; Finally, everybody knows you're carrying a child. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And we can't hide it anymore. Hallelujah. We just can't hide it. And neither do we want to hide it. We've been pregnantated by the spoken word of Almighty God. And we're thrilled about it. [Music] &gt;&gt; And that word will see you out of this country. &gt;&gt; That word will see you out of the grave if you go to the grave first. &gt;&gt; Don't belittle sir &gt;&gt; the word that's to raise you in the resurrection. &gt;&gt; But this is it. And here's really my theme, which I've been all this time getting to. Boaz, our kinsman redeemer. Oh, it is. I just so love this. He comes to the field towards the ending of day and all the reapers are there. There's a great revival going on. This is a harvest time. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And his eye is fixed. He sees one maiden &gt;&gt; and he speaks to his servant singular who's over all the reapers &gt;&gt; and he says to the servant who's going to introduce him to his bride. &gt;&gt; Who is this maiden? &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Oh, she's the moabitetish. &gt;&gt; She's a gentile. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; She's not Jewish, but she's a gentile. &gt;&gt; And from that time, he passes off the scene. And from that time forward, it's only Boaz and Ruth. &gt;&gt; Ruth goes and tells Naomi that Boaz, I'm in Boaz's field. Naomi tells her, Naomi, the Old Testament, tells her he's a near kinsman. &gt;&gt; It's the Old Testament that tells us all about the kinsmen. It's the law of Moses that gave us the law of the kinsman &gt;&gt; and the work of the kinsman and what he had to do. And Boaz begins to do that. And the prophet in our day begins to show that this is Revelation five. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Our kinsman &gt;&gt; came and took the book &gt;&gt; and you were in the book. &gt;&gt; Boaz as a kinsman came and took Ruth. &gt;&gt; He didn't leave her in the field. He took her &gt;&gt; to his own place &gt;&gt; and gave her seed. &gt;&gt; And God, the Bible says, gave her conception. God gave you seed, &gt;&gt; a spoken word seed. &gt;&gt; And but God gave you the conception. [Applause] &gt;&gt; And just as he's ready to take her, &gt;&gt; is it all right? I have a few more minutes. &gt;&gt; Just as he's ready to take her, &gt;&gt; Boaz says, "But there's a nearer kinsman. There's one that's nearer than me. &gt;&gt; Oh, and I will go to him first and see if he can redeem you. I was reading it in the original Hebrew and I'll just read it for you. And here's the original Hebrew when Boaz says that and he says, "Now surely it is true that a redeemer am I or a redeemer I am. But also there is a redeemer nearer than I." said, "So stay here tonight, and it shall be in the morning. If he will redeem you, good, he will redeem. If not, he is pleased to redeem you, then I will redeem you." I won't go into it. Brother Brandham said that was the devil. &gt;&gt; He was the first one that was closer to you. You were born in this world with a sinful nature. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; You were born in this world shapen in iniquities and speaking lies and and he had and the Bible said and the prophet of God says he had control of you and your own life tells you he had control of you and what he said you did and the places he enticed you to go you went. He was in. But there was one thing Boaz said to him, "All right, if you'll redeem Naomi, the Old Testament, &gt;&gt; which was just under blood of bulls and goats, &gt;&gt; he said, "Will you redeem her?" He says, "I'll redeem her &gt;&gt; because you could kill goats and bulls forever." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So he didn't have any problem with that. &gt;&gt; He said, "But let it be known that if you're going to redeem Naomi, you got to redeem Ruth also." Yeah. &gt;&gt; Oh, he said, "I can't do it." &gt;&gt; And the prophet of God said he couldn't do it. Do you know why he couldn't do it? Because he couldn't redeem you from sin when he was the author of sin. &gt;&gt; He said he already was the devil. How could he redeem you? &gt;&gt; He was the one who brought you to this lost state. &gt;&gt; He was the one who robbed it from us. How could he save us? &gt;&gt; He was the one who brought us to his side of the chasm. How was he going to take us to the other side? &gt;&gt; And it was that one thing. &gt;&gt; Oh, follow me. Stay real close. The one thing he couldn't do was create. &gt;&gt; And in order to redeem, there had to be an act of creation. &gt;&gt; And I say redemption, you can hung this phrase and stay with it. Redemption hung on the thread of creation. That's right. &gt;&gt; Redemption hung on that little thread &gt;&gt; of creative power. &gt;&gt; That's why I read Matthew first. redemption actually hung on Isaiah being able to say against all science and against all the wisdom of the world and against everything that a man that even had been with the king of Uzziah that a man a man who had been respected would say a virgin will conceive. &gt;&gt; But redemption hung &gt;&gt; on that word. Amen. &gt;&gt; And if God spoke it, God will never deny it. &gt;&gt; And whether it be 2,000 years ago or 10,000 years ago or 10,000 in the future, a virgin would conceive. &gt;&gt; Are you with me? &gt;&gt; There's no way. It's not going to happen. &gt;&gt; It was going to take place. And Satan, the nearer kinsman, could not bring forth a virgin birth. &gt;&gt; He says, "I can't do it." &gt;&gt; Then Boaz said, "Well, I will." &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; I'm a mighty man of wealth. I will. &gt;&gt; And he said, "A redeemer I am." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I love that. A redeemer I am. And if he won't do it, if he's not pleased to do it, I will do it. &gt;&gt; I don't care who you are. You might be a motivish. You came from a very bad background. You came from a very terrible uh life, but I will do it. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. I'll bring you into my place. I'll sew you with my seed and I will redeem you fully. &gt;&gt; And you won't only become a wife, you'll become the mother of kings. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; I won't you won't only become my wife but you will be called in the New Testament. &gt;&gt; Your name will be transferred into the book of into the book of uh uh Matthew. &gt;&gt; You will be called one of the mothers of Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Now I close. Do you think the same as I opened with Mary, the Virgin Mary, do you think for a moment that Ruth, there she is, fresh out of the field, she'd been laying at this man's feet through the night, resting. And then the prophet says, Ruth deciding, Ruth resting and Ruth rewarded &gt;&gt; four stages of redemption in her life. Do you think you could have said to her, "Ruth, Ruth, you're going to bear a son and you're going to actually change the whole direction of redemption." They would knew well about redemption. You're going to be used in this way to change the whole uh the whole effect of redemption. In fact, is Boaz through you. who is going to change from kinsman redeemer and through your seed you're going to be instrumental in turning him into king of kings &gt;&gt; right &gt;&gt; he's going to be the son he's going to be the lion of the tribe of Judah he's going to take his kingship through you &gt;&gt; now folks you can think I'm crazy whatever you want to think for 2 cares. Jesus has been made known to the people and by the people that he's Jesus and he's waiting. He has his arms extended. He's waiting for you. He's the lamb. He He bled for you. He died. He hung on a cross for you. There has to come a time when that ends. &gt;&gt; There has to come a time when that phase of it ends. Amen. &gt;&gt; You can ship me off if you want on the next boat to whoever, wherever. But I'm here to tell you on the authority of what the prophet of God spoke &gt;&gt; that season has ended. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And we're just in the changing and and you want to know what part of redemption you're playing &gt;&gt; through you. Through the bride of Jesus Christ. We're not just a bunch of little churches here and there. You're not called just to be a church. You're not called just to sing in a choir or to play in a church. That's not where we're called here to believe a word that God has said. We're called to believe that word and it will be pregnantated by that and a life will come forth. &gt;&gt; You don't know any more about that life than Ruth did. &gt;&gt; And you don't know any more about that life than perhaps Mary did &gt;&gt; because you don't know just how it's going to happen. How is God going to go back? But he's going to change back through the bride of Jesus Christ. He's he's making himself known as king. &gt;&gt; King, &gt;&gt; son of David, &gt;&gt; as king. &gt;&gt; And he's making a shift and he's going back to the Jews. I don't know when. I don't know if it's already started. &gt;&gt; I don't know if it's halfway through. But before he takes his position as king of the Jews, the same prophet said, "You will be gone." &gt;&gt; Amen. You know, if you told me that God was going to bring forth uh child by a virgin birth, Brother Brandham says that's not that scarcely is that's not as miraculous as a natural birth. &gt;&gt; If you think of God Almighty, creator of heavens and earth, speaking a word in a woman conceiving, I I understand that in a moment. But how you brought forth a child and in your womb you women that a spine begins to form and that ears and hands and features of a body and a heart begins to beat when it's just a little piece of pulp. You talk about marvelous. And to think God would take you as a human being and bring forth that kind of life. That God has ordained you men, women, sons, and daughters of God to bring forth a life of Jesus Christ. This word is a literal seed. &gt;&gt; This word has pregnantated certain people. &gt;&gt; And and you that may not have experienced it, you ought to say today with unabashed forward out open say, "Oh God, Let your word penetrate &gt;&gt; and come down into the womb of my soul and bring forth the life of Jesus Christ. [Applause] &gt;&gt; You think that that's being too forceful? Not at all. One of Jacob's wives who couldn't have children, she laid a hold of him, said, "Give me children or I die." Amen. &gt;&gt; You think that was some little weak statement? &gt;&gt; No. It meant everything. &gt;&gt; Give me children or I die. &gt;&gt; And he said, "Am I God? &gt;&gt; How can I do that?" If a woman could do that for a natural son, &gt;&gt; how much more you and I long after this service, God help us. We're not just having church. When you go home and you're in your car, oh God, oh God, hear me. If I got anything out of the sermon this morning, fragate me with your living word seed. &gt;&gt; When you read the next message &gt;&gt; and you hear that God sent this messenger &gt;&gt; with a spoken word seed, &gt;&gt; you'll not take it as a booklet or a tape or just a a sermon that somebody's preaching. You say, "This is a seed of God. This is God's creative power &gt;&gt; that he sent into me. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; It'll change your life. &gt;&gt; It'll bring about changes you never even dreamed of. Forget about how you want to change your life. Believe the word. Believe him who God has sent. &gt;&gt; Amen. [Applause] &gt;&gt; There was a nearer kinsman, but he couldn't do it. Hallelujah. He couldn't do it. &gt;&gt; He couldn't He couldn't bring forth the spoken word. &gt;&gt; He's out there all over on every church corner &gt;&gt; saying today, "I can do it. I can do it. I can do it." &gt;&gt; But there's one who said he can't do it. &gt;&gt; And the prophet of God came in this generation said he couldn't do it. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; So, we had one that did do it. Amen. &gt;&gt; A near kinsman. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Oh, I want to sing. &gt;&gt; Redeemed. &gt;&gt; Redeemed. There's so many songs I could uh pass through my mind. I'm going to have brother Kim come and help me. Brother Derek is busy at the camp today and we're busy here hearing the word. &gt;&gt; How do you feel? Amen. &gt;&gt; How do you believe? &gt;&gt; You believe it? &gt;&gt; That's the thing I want to know. You believe it? &gt;&gt; Why don't we stand? &gt;&gt; Father, dear father, you were not uh you did not hold back whatsoever. You chose your vessels and you spoke through them all down through the centuries of time. You're doing so even now. &gt;&gt; You did in this generation. I'm deeply humbled this morning to think that perhaps I could take this time, a couple of hours of these people's time and speak of the things that I've seen and heard and bring to them the message that they have heard and believed. And for some we rejoice together, oh God. We rejoice in what you're doing. We rejoice immensely. And others, Lord, I pray that I've been instrumental in creating within them a great hunger. &gt;&gt; A hunger that will not let them go long after they've left this building. &gt;&gt; May they cry out to you in their own quiet time. Oh God almighty, creator of heavens and earth. Create in me, oh God. &gt;&gt; Create in me the very life source of Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; Live in me richly. &gt;&gt; If you're here and you have not experienced that, you can do so in this moment. If God is calling you, I cannot call you. The sermon can't call you. It must be the Holy Spirit of God that calls you. But if he's calling you, I say in the name of the Lord, yield to that voice. If you've been just a hearer of the message, oh friend, don't cross over in the attitude you're in right now. Cease being just a hearer of the word and say, "Oh God, I want to be a full participant. &gt;&gt; I want to be surrendered to you. come in all of your beauty &gt;&gt; and all of your power and create within me &gt;&gt; the life of Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; Father, if we've done wrong, thought wrong, sinned, had iniquity in our heart, forgive us, oh God. &gt;&gt; I pray you'll forgive forgiveness will come to each one, oh Lord, and they will receive it from you, &gt;&gt; Jesus Christ, in your name. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Work. Lord. I prayed earlier today that you'd send your Holy Ghost spirit across this congregation of people and those on the internet reach out. Oh father in Jesus name. In Jesus name. Loose the bands. Loose the feathers and cause this one that was nearer. This one who said he would be a redeemer but he didn't have the power to redeem. He didn't have the blood to redeem. He didn't have the creation in him to redeem. He's a deceiver, a perverter. And we deny him &gt;&gt; in Jesus Christ's name. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. [Music] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. [Music] &gt;&gt; Redeemed. Redeemed. Let's just worship for a moment. Redee, redeemed, redeemed by the blood of the lamb. Redee, redeem [Music] forever. I am redeemed. How I love to redeem the lamb through his mercy [Music] forever. I am redeemed. Redee his child forever. I am the last place. No, I shall see his beauty. The king might [Music] be my and redee. Redeemed is forever. I am I am redeemed. I am redeemed. I am redeemed. Heat. Heat. [Applause] I am you just I am I am [Music] I am redeemed with the Christ. Jesus has changed my whole life. [Music] [Music] that I am redeemed. I can't tell you how privileged I feel and am to be with you, &gt;&gt; the redeemed. &gt;&gt; And we're singing right now, but I'm going to tell you on the authority of God's word, you are going to sing. And I'm saying this in faith and by grace. You and I are going to sing. We're going to sing about his redemption. &gt;&gt; And the angels, Prophet God said, angels are going to stand &gt;&gt; in bowed silence because they can't sing it. &gt;&gt; Creatures of worship, but they can't sing it. They've never been lost. They've never been redeemed. Amen. &gt;&gt; And they're going to stand listening to you and I say, &gt;&gt; "That's not a myth. &gt;&gt; That's not some far off fence story. That's a reality." &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And furthermore, do you believe what I'm do you believe what the prophet of God said? &gt;&gt; You believe it? &gt;&gt; He said, "An angel is standing right beside you." Amen. &gt;&gt; That angel is there to protect that angel. Your word body is right beside you. &gt;&gt; But that angel cannot participate in the song you're singing right now. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He can't say I'm redeemed, but you can. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; That's fine, friends. You can ship me off to the puzzle factory if you want to, &gt;&gt; but you might as well sing a song for your angel. &gt;&gt; All right, Angel, I'll sing for you. You can't sing this one, but I'll sing it for you. &gt;&gt; I am redeemed. &gt;&gt; I am redeemed. Everyone Jesus has changed. [Music] [Music] I have to make an announcement in April. How many remember Brother Gary Walker, Sister Deborah, Brother Gary Walker? Did you see the pictures? Remember the pictures? Many of you never did see the pictures. You won't need to. You're going to see him. &gt;&gt; Amen. He was driving in his car in New Zealand coming to a a place on the road after a meeting I believe it was going a curve and a truck with a huge load of logs or timber and lumber on it was coming around. They came around too fast and the load broke loose and the load fell on his car. His wife was in the car and he threw himself over to protect her. uh from the from the crush and uh I don't know how badly she was hurt but the air helicopter ambulance they had said he's dead they tried to revive him they then he would come back then he'd go again he was broken crushed from the top of his head to the soles of his feet we have followed They flew him into a hospital and the paramedics said there was just no way that this was impossible. Flew him into a hospital and he started the long road to recovery. And the doctors and the medical team said he won't do this and he won't be able to do that. He won't have his mentality. He won't have his mental capabilities. He won't have this movement. He won't have his arm movements. And they have all come to confess, we have never never in our entire in our entire profession seen this kind of resolve and determination. And that man now he is mowing his lawn behind a lawnmower. He is standing behind a pulpit and ministering. And God's willing, he's going to stand behind this pulpit and minister to you. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. [Music] April the 18th and we're going to show the pictures and he's got a PowerPoint presentation and he's going to preach. I've asked him, he's a little bit nervous about it, but you can be praying about it. I asked him that I would like to have him and Sister Deborah on the platform and do an interview. And he said, "I'm a little uncomfortable. That's out of my comfort zone. But if you feel led to, and I'll tell you why I feel led to. Brother Kim Dingwall sat here with his wife Haddie and Beth who was here. How many years was Beth with leukemia? Six years fighting the devil of leukemia. Sister Beth, who stands? Raise your hand. Sister Beth, raise it higher. There you are. Sister Beth comes in here and does uh mission secretarial work for her daddy. That girl laid for six years in and out of hospitals. Her hospital record is almost a foot high. And usually they don't give those documents out. When brother Kim said, "We want to do a video interview. We've been asked." And they just sent gave him the whole file. Sister Beth's testimony, Sister Beth's testimony, we'll pray for him, is mandatory information now with the nurses in the hospital in Calgary. We have a little little boy here. Let's just bow our heads and pray for him. Heavenly Father, so much of this viruses and going around and our young lad here, brother Tom Frey's son, I believe, just had this fainting spell. In the name of Jesus Christ, our redeemer, our redeemer, let the virtue from the resurrected redeemer flow into his body. Lord, we rebuke the enemy that would try to distract and distract the people and distract him. And if it's some kind of sickness trying to come on, we rebuke you, Satan. In the name of Jesus Christ, we deny you this right. You do not have, you cannot cross this threshold. You are not the redeemer. Our redeemer is Jehovah Rafa. He's Jehovah Nissi. He's Jehovah Tidu. He is the healer. We thank you, oh God, your power thrust him out in Jesus Christ's name. And that your name may be glorified. And even now, we thank you, Lord, for what you did for brother Gary Walker. And that you will bring him, oh God, here. And that the people will hear and many more perhaps who are streaming will make an effort to be here during that time in Jesus Christ's name. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Hallelujah. lay hands on him and get him a little a little bit of water. Amen. Hallelujah. God bless you, son. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Our redeemer is faithful and true. &gt;&gt; Can we sing that? Uh do we have the words to it? Our redeemer is faithful and true. Those of you that maybe don't know it, lift it up. Don't be don't be hesitant. and then we're closing. Thank you all the people from Seattle. I see a number of you here. And I say to the congregation, don't don't be ashamed or afraid. Just ask people, are you are you from Tacoma or Seattle or Mary'sville or someplace? So they if they want to be to the evening service or even if they don't can't be to the evening service, maybe they can slip over to your place, have a bite to eat or take them out, whatever. And I'd like to do that. Show all the hospitality you can. Would you do that? God bless you. So nice to see you. Amen. &gt;&gt; My redeemer is faithful and true. Everything he has said he will do. Thank you now. Every morning his mercies are new. My redeemer is faithful and true. &gt;&gt; Once again, let's just &gt;&gt; My redeemer is faithful and everything he has said he will will do. Every morning his mercies are new. My redeemer is faithful and true. Let's just power. Heavenly Father, there are so many gallant men of God here that I would like to have heard pray. But now we are just standing here at the post of duty to ask your blessings. Special blessings upon the people as they leave. Your presence will be with them. Let it be an intense presence. Let it be one that is actually felt within them as they go in their automobiles or down the highways. Give them safe drive. The people that have come from Seattle, Tacoma, Mary'sville, and from distant places. Bless them. Bless them. I pray. May the word be quickened to them in Jesus Christ's name. I pray that you'll dismiss us with your smile of approval. Lord of all things we want to be pleasing to you. &gt;&gt; Yes, Lord. &gt;&gt; We thank you now in Jesus name. Amen. &gt;&gt; I dismiss you in the name of the Lord. If you'll just greet one another and then leave uh quietly at 5:00 tonight, we're going to hear from brother John Andy's.
