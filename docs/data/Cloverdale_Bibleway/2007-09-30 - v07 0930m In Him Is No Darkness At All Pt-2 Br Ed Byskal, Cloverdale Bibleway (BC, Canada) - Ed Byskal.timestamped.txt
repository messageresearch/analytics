[6:07] And we're going to go to prayer this
[6:08] time. And uh we've got a prayer cloth
[6:13] here we're going to pray over this
[6:14] morning. And uh
[6:19] as well, there's a a lady by the name of
[6:22] Nagar uh been diagnosed with thyroid
[6:26] cancer and uh
[6:29] doesn't attend the church. called and
[6:31] asked for prayer. And also Russ Hayden
[6:34] has uh
[6:37] found a spot on his lung and is in need
[6:40] of salvation and want to pray for him
[6:42] this morning that God would touch him.
[6:44] Amen. Speak to his heart. If you've got
[6:47] a need this morning, regardless of what
[6:49] it would be, you just lift it before the
[6:51] Lord this morning as we go to prayer.
[6:52] I'm going to ask our brother Tom Brady
[6:54] to come and open the service in a word
[6:56] of prayer. over the top.
[6:59] Hallelujah.
[7:02] Lord, as the songwriter is pen, touching
[7:05] Jesus
[7:07] is all that really matters. And so,
[7:10] Lord, by faith, we reach out to you this
[7:13] morning, saying, "Lamb of God, meet our
[7:16] need."
[7:17] As brother Rod has read these requests,
[7:19] Lord, there's needy souls, needy of a
[7:22] touch from the master, for you are the
[7:24] great healer, Lord God. And we're asking
[7:27] for these ones that are in need, Lord.
[7:30] and less you intervene, they'd go off
[7:33] into another realm, Lord, not knowing
[7:35] you. But we pray that you'll move on the
[7:38] scene,
[7:40] Lord, that you would save not only or
[7:42] deliver not only their body, but the
[7:45] soul that beats deep within. We're
[7:47] asking, God, that you will save them,
[7:50] that they'll look to you, lamb of God,
[7:52] their creator, their savior, their
[7:55] everything, their all and all. And so
[7:57] Lord, not only these requests, but those
[8:00] that are standing here, I'm sure we
[8:02] could all lift up our hearts and hands
[8:04] and say, "Lord, I am needy of you. Needy
[8:07] that you pass by my way." Like that
[8:10] little woman, Lord, that crawled over
[8:12] the disciples to get to your hem. I
[8:17] pray, Lord, that there will be faith
[8:18] within us that could reach within the
[8:20] veil and say, "Lord, meet my need and
[8:23] meet the hunger of my soul. will meet
[8:25] the longing that is deep within. And
[8:28] Father, we'll be sure to give you all
[8:30] glory. And those that have joined us on
[8:33] the way of the internet, we pray that
[8:35] you'll also meet the need. Lord God,
[8:38] that you will intervene and you will
[8:41] speak, you will deal, and you will meet
[8:43] every need. And Father, as our pastor
[8:46] will come, we're asking you'll anoint
[8:48] the men of God. Speak.
[8:52] We're waiting to hear what the spirit
[8:54] would say to the church this morning.
[8:57] And so Lord, we say speak to us, Lord,
[8:59] and let our ears be open. And may God,
[9:02] you revelate your people and stir us and
[9:05] stimulate us is my prayer. Meet us,
[9:08] Lord, in a special way. And Father,
[9:10] we're asking now you take control of the
[9:13] service. Praying God you be glorified
[9:15] through it all. In Jesus name we pray.
[9:19] Amen.

[32:06] giving us this, giving us this
[32:08] reconciliation,
[32:11] bringing redemption to us, hopeless,
[32:14] lost, born in sin, and chapen iniquity.
[32:19] And you reconciled us to yourself.
[32:22] You took your great arms of love and
[32:24] have embraced us, brought us in close to
[32:28] your bosom. As a father, you have
[32:31] carried us in your bosom.
[32:34] As a shepherd, you've carried the lambs,
[32:37] those that have been injured, those that
[32:39] have been wounded, those that have
[32:40] strayed. You sought after them, Lord,
[32:43] and sought after us.
[32:46] Oh God, we're standing here today with
[32:49] thanksgiving in our heart. Our hearts
[32:51] are overflowing.
[32:53] We're trembling inside, Lord, just
[32:55] knowing your presence is here with us.
[32:59] And I pray it'll be such a reality, oh
[33:01] God, that there won't be one person able
[33:04] to escape that divine nearness.
[33:07] I pray, oh father, you'll take every
[33:11] &gt;&gt; every spirit of attempt to hinder us,
[33:14] Lord. And may every man, woman, and
[33:16] child be free to worship you in spirit
[33:19] and in truth.
[33:21] Bless your children, bless your bride, I
[33:24] pray, know Lord, now take us in your
[33:27] hand as we soon will approach your word
[33:30] in Jesus Christ's name and for your
[33:32] glory. Amen.
[33:34] &gt;&gt; Amen. What a wonderful day.
[33:39] &gt;&gt; So just a such a blessing to hear that
[33:44] God has moved on the scene for our
[33:46] brother Ron Spencer.
[33:49] I was cautious as I spoke to you over
[33:52] the over the last number of days about
[33:56] brother Ron while he was in the hospital
[33:59] because we uh some of the ministers were
[34:02] receiving some very very up-to-date
[34:05] information on a daily basis and it
[34:08] wasn't very long ago
[34:10] just about a week ago that it was
[34:12] looking very very dim and our brother
[34:15] Ron could have slipped away from us in
[34:19] mo in a moment's time.
[34:22] But uh in about 24 hours there was a a
[34:27] complete turnaround about 24 hours and
[34:30] he opened his eyes and began to speak
[34:33] and began to smile and uh and then they
[34:37] did an operation of course to uh do some
[34:40] skin graft and it went uh it went well
[34:44] but healing and I know many were
[34:47] praying. I know this church was praying
[34:50] because we have a special love for him
[34:53] and his wife, Sister Connie. And as I
[34:56] was speaking to Sister Connie
[34:59] when brother Ron was not able to
[35:03] communicate,
[35:04] I just I wanted to encourage you. There
[35:06] was one day that she came very heavy on
[35:08] my heart and I called their home and she
[35:12] had the home line
[35:14] uh forwarded to her cell phone and she
[35:17] was sitting as bedside
[35:19] or I'm sorry she was on her way from one
[35:22] hospital to the other and uh I just felt
[35:26] that she really needed encouraging and
[35:29] and I I also just talked about the camp.
[35:33] I said, "We we've uh negotiated a we're
[35:37] negotiating on a camp on a Mount Baker
[35:40] camp." And I said, "You tell Brother Ron
[35:43] he's going to preach in that camp." So I
[35:47] I I don't know whether I was saying that
[35:48] presumptuously or in faith, but I said
[35:50] it anyway.
[35:53] And uh she said, "I'll tell him that."
[35:55] So we're real thankful for uh what God
[35:59] has done. caretakers will be coming to
[36:01] the home to um
[36:04] to do what they need to do.
[36:08] And uh we have no, in case you're asking
[36:12] or wondering, we have no word uh they
[36:15] have released no information as far as
[36:18] uh what medical costs there may be. They
[36:20] are covered by insurance and uh so they
[36:23] have said nothing about any medical
[36:25] costs even though they have in there has
[36:27] been inquiry
[36:29] So, we will just say to you that uh when
[36:32] that moment comes and uh and we're made
[36:36] aware of it, we we'll certainly inform
[36:38] you here at the church because we would
[36:40] want to if they're left with a financial
[36:43] burden, we would want to do our part as
[36:45] well. So, we thank you for that.
[36:49] Um
[36:51] starting next Sunday, we're going to uh
[36:53] go back to two services. That'll be the
[36:56] first Sunday in October.
[36:59] It'll be Thanksgiving here on the
[37:01] Canadian side and I'm very very
[37:04] cognizant, very aware, very sensitive
[37:07] that the borders may be unduly uh,
[37:12] you know, heavy heavy traffic at that
[37:15] time and you'll just have to deal with
[37:19] it the best you can. But I feel that uh
[37:23] there's a it's Thanksgiving on the
[37:25] Canadian side, not on the US side. But I
[37:28] feel it would be uh we just wouldn't be
[37:31] doing what we should do without having a
[37:33] Thanksgiving
[37:34] uh a time when we can have a
[37:36] Thanksgiving service. And I think that
[37:37] that's a a good time to do it. So we'll
[37:40] be starting with two services each
[37:42] Sunday. And then we're going to be very
[37:44] very conscious also very aware of of the
[37:48] weekends and the time. And I I'm I'm I'm
[37:52] following it. For all of you that are on
[37:53] the US side, I can tell you that it's
[37:56] been a heavy burden on my heart for
[37:58] quite a long time and we're watching it
[38:01] very very carefully.
[38:03] Uh and we understand about the
[38:06] construction that's going to be taking
[38:07] place and and the lanes that are going
[38:10] to be closed at Blaine. And we'll just
[38:12] have to say we did actually a
[38:14] spreadsheet
[38:16] uh and brother Tom Frey, we thank him
[38:19] for that. Uh we asked and and pulled
[38:22] quite a number of people and asked them
[38:24] to keep track of how many how long they
[38:27] stayed at the border each way and which
[38:31] service and which days. So I actually
[38:32] have it on a spreadsheet. We put quite a
[38:35] bit of effort into this and I've noticed
[38:38] for the most part it's 15 minutes, 20
[38:40] minutes, maybe 30 minutes and u so we're
[38:44] going to watch it and and very very
[38:47] carefully. Uh we do not know. Oh, I will
[38:50] just uh say this about the camp. Uh
[38:53] things are moving in a positive
[38:55] direction. Uh the sellers have had to
[38:59] get a little bit of an extension because
[39:01] they needed to do a little further work.
[39:04] Uh and uh all I can say to you as a
[39:07] congregation
[39:09] so that I want you to know I think
[39:11] things are moving in a in a positive
[39:14] direction and we will know a lot more in
[39:18] in just a short time in m perhaps
[39:21] another couple weeks. But I say that
[39:24] because it's part of my comments
[39:26] regarding the border and regarding uh if
[39:30] things became really really difficult,
[39:32] at least we have a window because if the
[39:35] Lord sees that we get the camp, we have
[39:38] a very very fine uh chapel auditorium
[39:42] there that will handle 300 people very
[39:46] comfortably and even more. So if we
[39:48] needed to have a service there, wanted
[39:50] to have a service and use that and use
[39:53] that facility, it'll be at least
[39:55] available to us providing the providing
[39:58] we move forward with the camp. And uh
[40:02] we uh we were required to put some extra
[40:06] funds down on the weekend to do our part
[40:09] and so we have done that. And that is
[40:11] why I wanted to say that everything has
[40:14] moved. There's no no negative at this
[40:17] point. I want to just say a word of of
[40:21] thanks to our trustees. They have worked
[40:24] hard, very very hard. This congregation,
[40:28] you'll never know what's really involved
[40:30] in uh trying to achieve something like
[40:34] this. But if God should give us some
[40:37] time, this congregation and believers,
[40:41] we could say perhaps worldwide
[40:44] could be very very benefited and would
[40:46] be benefited by having a place that is a
[40:50] retreat for believers. A place where
[40:54] they could go where our young people and
[40:57] your young people, you may have them as
[40:59] small children around you now, but
[41:01] they're going to be teenagers one day.
[41:04] and uh and and the young people in this
[41:07] congregation have said to us that those
[41:09] were the finest meetings we've ever been
[41:12] at. But uh like brother Tim Prud, they
[41:15] have a meeting of young people that are
[41:19] senior young people probably from 15 or
[41:21] 16 years on up into their maybe mid or
[41:25] 20s and they gather about 420 or 430
[41:30] young people. They have young people's
[41:33] gatherings in in Belgium and in Europe
[41:36] and they fly from America and Canada to
[41:39] go over there because it's it's actually
[41:43] the bride of Jesus Christ can only
[41:46] really have full fellowship with the
[41:49] bride.
[41:51] &gt;&gt; You believe that? Amen.
[41:53] &gt;&gt; And uh and and that's why I think it's
[41:55] it's not family camp that I'm thinking
[41:58] of just only. Do you know that ministers
[42:01] and I'm one ministers I've thought many
[42:05] times where could I go where I can just
[42:08] get alone and get away and have a place
[42:12] where I can just retreat and kind of
[42:14] recover and have a place or maybe
[42:17] several ministers or or a few families.
[42:21] Well, if the Lord gives us this place,
[42:23] it opens up a tremendous uh opening for
[42:27] believers everywhere. I want to thank
[42:29] you for your prayers. I want to thank
[42:31] especially our brother Chris Peterson.
[42:33] You have been a tremendous tremendous
[42:36] help and assistance to myself and I know
[42:40] all the trustees and the congregation
[42:43] and believers everywhere. Brother John
[42:45] Briner has worked very very diligently
[42:48] and brother Tom Ray has really these
[42:53] these brothers have really spent a lot
[42:54] of time.
[42:57] You pray for me you can hear that I'm
[42:59] horsearo but soon as I get over these
[43:02] announcements and start preaching
[43:05] we'll be okay.
[43:08] God bless you.
[43:11] We can do all of these things, but if we
[43:15] if he doesn't build the house,
[43:17] &gt;&gt; we all we all labor in vain.
[43:21] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[43:23] &gt;&gt; And the scripture says if the watchman,
[43:26] you know, he watches in vain if God's
[43:30] not in it.
[43:32] &gt;&gt; And that's just precisely the way it is.
[43:35] And I I believe that you you know the
[43:37] scripture real well. I know that you're
[43:39] standing, but so am I. Don't forget
[43:41] that.
[43:45] Except the Lord build a house,
[43:48] they labor in vain that build it. Except
[43:51] the Lord keep the city,
[43:54] the watchman waketh, but in vain. So, I
[43:56] can be awake and we you you know, you
[43:59] can watch over your house as fathers and
[44:01] parents,
[44:02] but if if if God doesn't watch the city,
[44:05] if God doesn't watch the house, if God
[44:07] doesn't watch the church, if God doesn't
[44:10] watch over the bride, we're we're in
[44:11] awakened vain. I I don't believe we're
[44:14] in vain. Amen.
[44:17] I want to I wanted to sing.
[44:21] We only have one service today, so we'll
[44:24] just have two at once. I want to sing
[44:26] this is your house.
[44:29] &gt;&gt; Just the chorus. This is your house.
[44:32] Let's just offer it to him. Amen.
[44:37] &gt;&gt; This is your house.
[44:40] [Music]
[44:45] [Applause]
[44:48] &gt;&gt; This is your house.
[44:55] Holy house of prayer
[44:59] where the lost and the lonely
[45:04] bring their burdens and their cares.
[45:09] This is your house.
[45:14] This is your house. Oh, let's invite
[45:18] him. Come and dwell.
[45:24] This is your house.
[45:29] Oh father come and
[45:35] this is your house.
[45:39] In the holy house of prayer
[45:45] where the stand
[45:51] their burdens and their cares.
[45:55] This is your house.
[46:00] This is your house.
[46:04] Oh come and dwell.
[46:10] God bless you. You're a wonderful
[46:12] congregation
[46:15] and we have an invisible congregation.
[46:17] They're wonderful, too.
[46:18] &gt;&gt; I'll have you turn in your Bibles,
[46:20] please. We're going to read three
[46:22] places. Genesis uh 1:es
[46:26] 1-4.
[46:28] Then we will be reading in Matthew the
[46:30] 4th chapter
[46:31] verses 12-15.
[46:34] And we'll be reading in Revelation 22:14
[46:40] down to 17. And if you
[46:44] were really alert, you gather that we
[46:47] are starting in the beginning of the
[46:48] Bible. We're reading in the middle and
[46:51] we're reading at the end. And a very
[46:53] specific purpose.
[46:55] All right. God be with us now as we read
[47:01] Genesis 1. In the beginning, God created
[47:04] the heaven and the earth. And the earth
[47:06] was without form and void, and darkness
[47:09] was upon the face of the deep. And the
[47:12] spirit of God moved upon the face of the
[47:14] waters. And God said, "Let there be
[47:16] light." And there was light. And God saw
[47:20] the light that it was good. And God
[47:23] divided the light from the darkness.
[47:26] Matthew 4:12.
[47:30] Now when Jesus had heard that John was
[47:32] cast into prison,
[47:35] he departed in a Galilee,
[47:37] and leaving Nazareth, he came and dwelt
[47:40] in Capernaum, which is upon the sea
[47:42] coast in the borders of Zabulon and
[47:45] Nephilim,
[47:47] that it might be fulfilled which was
[47:49] spoken by Isaiah the prophet, saying,
[47:51] "The land of Zabulon and the land of
[47:54] Nephilim, by the way of the sea, beyond
[47:57] Jordan, Galilee, of the Gentiles, else.
[48:00] I believe I
[48:02] there's another scripture I had written
[48:04] down there. Just give me a moment,
[48:06] please.
[48:18] The people,
[48:20] the people which verse 16, the people
[48:23] which sat in darkness saw a great light.
[48:28] And to them which sat in the region and
[48:30] shadow of death, light is sprung up. And
[48:34] from that time Jesus began to preach and
[48:37] to say, "Repent, for the kingdom of
[48:40] heaven is at hand." And then I want to
[48:43] read in Revelation 22 starting with
[48:45] verse 14 down to 17.
[48:48] Blessed are they which do his
[48:51] commandments, that they may have right
[48:53] to the tree of life, and may enter in
[48:56] through the gates into the city.
[48:59] For without are dogs, and sorcerers, and
[49:02] wararm mongers, and murderers, and
[49:06] idoltors, and whosoever loveth, and
[49:09] maketh a lie. I, Jesus, sent mine angel
[49:12] to testify unto you these things in the
[49:15] churches. I am the root and the
[49:17] offspring of David and the bright and
[49:19] morning star.
[49:21] &gt;&gt; And the spirit and the bride say come.
[49:24] Let him that heareth say come. Let him
[49:27] that is a thirst come. And whosoever
[49:30] will let him come and take of the water
[49:34] of life freely. God bless his word and
[49:36] bless you as you have your saints.
[49:41] Our
[49:48] first reading,
[49:50] God separated
[49:52] the light from the darkness.
[49:56] In our second reading,
[49:59] it was the same.
[50:01] Jesus Christ
[50:03] uh came at this particular season
[50:07] and when he had heard that John was cast
[50:09] into prison
[50:11] and leaving Nazareth, he came and dwelt
[50:14] in Capernaum
[50:16] that the scripture might be fulfilled
[50:19] that the Gentiles would see a great
[50:22] light
[50:23] and light always separates
[50:27] darkness from light and that is what
[50:30] happened when Jesus Christ as a son of
[50:33] manifested
[50:35] himself.
[50:37] Darkness was separated from light. And
[50:40] in the end, it says, "They that do his
[50:44] commandments, they may have right to the
[50:47] tree of life and enter through the gates
[50:49] into the city." And there's another
[50:52] separation because and it's a final
[50:55] separation.
[50:58] a final separation
[51:01] where the children of light
[51:04] enter in and have a right to the tree of
[51:07] life
[51:10] and those that remain outside
[51:13] the final separation of light and
[51:16] darkness
[51:18] and that is where I'm going to be coming
[51:20] from today.
[51:25] In the beginning, God separated light
[51:27] from darkness. In the end of the Bible,
[51:30] he separates light from darkness.
[51:33] In the message shalom,
[51:35] brother Brandham refers, and this is his
[51:38] New Year's service. The difference he's
[51:42] speaking, the difference is just like it
[51:44] was in the beginning. There was gross
[51:47] darkness upon the earth.
[51:50] The spirit of God moved upon the face of
[51:53] the water and said, "Let there be
[51:57] light." And God separated the light from
[52:00] the darkness. And I believe
[52:04] I have it highlighted in red. And I
[52:07] believe that we are now living in that
[52:11] hour again
[52:14] when God is separating light from
[52:16] darkness
[52:18] and he's pressing it to the other side
[52:20] of the world that the light might be
[52:24] made manifest.
[52:27] And here we are.
[52:34] He went on to say, "The church, the
[52:36] reason I'd say shalom to them is because
[52:40] that it's God's peace."
[52:44] I have some slides
[52:47] that I I want to show from this quote
[52:54] and I want to go through it with you.
[53:16] Okay,
[53:20] I want you to follow this thought
[53:24] and I'm going to take my time with this.
[53:28] says, "The reason
[53:31] I'd say shalom to them is because it's
[53:36] God's peace." Talking about shalom.
[53:52] We're looking forward to the breaking of
[53:55] a new day.
[53:57] until there is something great laying
[53:59] ahead of us. Now the the context is
[54:02] peace. The reason I would say shalom is
[54:06] because shalom is God's peace. Now, now
[54:10] he's approaching
[54:12] why the reason I would say shalom
[54:16] is because it's the breaking of a new
[54:20] day. And day refers to daybreak refers
[54:25] to light coming on the earth, warmth
[54:29] coming on the earth, and life coming on
[54:33] the earth. And that's the reason why
[54:37] we'd say shalom. There's no reason to
[54:40] say shalom if there's no light. If
[54:42] there's no daybreak happening, if
[54:44] there's no light coming, if there's no
[54:46] warmth from the sun coming on the earth,
[54:49] I'm talking about this earth
[54:52] &gt;&gt; that's sitting in these seats today. If
[54:54] there's no light arising, if there's no
[54:57] daybreak coming, if there's no sun
[54:59] arising, if there's no man here that can
[55:02] turn on the light,
[55:05] &gt;&gt; there's no reason to say shalom.
[55:07] &gt;&gt; It it's just an empty word. Oh, shalom.
[55:10] Peace. Peace. And then we say, where's
[55:12] the peace?
[55:14] &gt;&gt; Where's the life? Where is the light? I
[55:17] still stumble around in this confusion.
[55:19] There' be no reason to say, "But the
[55:21] prophet is saying the reason why I say
[55:25] shalom is because the day is breaking.
[55:29] &gt;&gt; There's a new day breaking." He knew it.
[55:32] It was prophetic.
[55:36] &gt;&gt; And we're looking forward to the
[55:38] breaking
[55:41] of a new day until there's something
[55:42] great laying ahead of us. And this is
[55:44] what is great. The pressing
[55:47] coming of the great light.
[55:53] And now we can see it breaking
[55:56] over the horizontal realm.
[56:00] And some may say, well, I think that he
[56:01] meant horizon. No, he said horizontal.
[56:05] And you can look, it's a very proper
[56:07] word.
[56:08] It's breaking between
[56:11] mortal and immortality. This is why he's
[56:14] announcing to the church, to the bride,
[56:17] shalom. It's a new day. There's light
[56:20] coming, a breaking between mortal and
[56:23] immortality,
[56:25] breaking between heavens and earth, from
[56:28] an earthbound sickness and troubled
[56:31] world unto a bright shining day of an
[56:34] immortal life and an immortal body and
[56:38] an immortal earth that can never pass
[56:42] away.
[56:43] &gt;&gt; It's shalom unto the church.
[56:47] Can you not say amen to that?
[56:50] &gt;&gt; It's light time coming for the
[56:53] believers, but a gross darkness upon the
[56:57] people,
[57:01] one paragraph,
[57:03] powerful
[57:05] and wonderful.
[57:07] It's shalom unto the church. So I say to
[57:11] you, shalom.
[57:14] He said, "God has begun to separate
[57:17] light from the darkness, pressing it
[57:20] behind like he did in the beginning to
[57:24] show the dawn of a new day."
[57:30] In the book of Revelation, we read this
[57:33] verse 21 and 23.
[57:36] And the city had no light of the sun,
[57:40] neither of the moon to shine in it. For
[57:43] the glory of God did lighten it, and the
[57:46] lamb is the light thereof.
[57:51] &gt;&gt; And God saw the light.
[57:54] And he said the first light was God's
[57:58] word made manifest. And that's always
[58:01] been the light. If if God's word isn't
[58:04] made manifest, there is no light. So God
[58:06] said, "Let there be light." Brother
[58:09] Brandham said, "If a fog came,
[58:13] if just more fog came, then he says
[58:19] wasn't God's word."
[58:21] He said, "Let there be light." If that
[58:24] if it is so, then light comes.
[58:28] Let me just bring it down to today's
[58:30] time. We could say
[58:33] Malachi 4:5 and 6, behold, I send you
[58:36] Elijah the prophet before the great and
[58:38] dreadful day of the Lord. You can say
[58:40] it, I can say it. Someone else can say
[58:41] it. But if God doesn't come behind and
[58:46] manifest that,
[58:48] &gt;&gt; it'll just remain as it is. It'll remain
[58:51] obscure. We say, "Well, when is it to
[58:53] happen? Who is this? Who is this
[58:55] Elijah?" Uh, you know, what is the
[58:57] season? What is the time? And it remains
[59:00] confused
[59:02] and we remain confused. But then when
[59:05] the when the person who's ordained to
[59:08] say that,
[59:10] the one who's ordained to manifest that,
[59:13] when he says it, everything changes
[59:16] because what happens is it dawns. Light
[59:19] comes.
[59:20] &gt;&gt; The manifested word. When the word comes
[59:23] in its season, light comes. And when
[59:27] light comes, you don't wonder about
[59:29] what's happening. You don't wonder
[59:32] about, you know, uh uh what's around
[59:34] you. If things are dark, you hear a
[59:37] sound. You can't tell what it is. But
[59:39] when there's light, you hear a sound.
[59:41] You just look, you can see it. And when
[59:43] you see it, there's no problem. There's
[59:46] no confusion. There's no fear.
[59:50] &gt;&gt; There's no wonderment about it. But when
[59:52] things are dark, that's when things are
[59:54] spooky. That's when things because you
[59:57] don't know and so you're on the alert.
[1:00:00] But if if it's if you have sight and if
[1:00:03] it's daylight and you can see then it
[1:00:07] changes it completely. And so God saw
[1:00:10] the light and he says this God saw the
[1:00:15] light that it was good. You cannot find
[1:00:18] any scripture in the Bible where it says
[1:00:21] and God saw the darkness and it was
[1:00:24] good. You can't find that.
[1:00:27] &gt;&gt; God saw the light and the light was
[1:00:30] good.
[1:00:32] &gt;&gt; In other words, the light was pleasant.
[1:00:36] It was desirable.
[1:00:39] It was to delight in greatly. It was
[1:00:42] excellent. Listen to this in the Hebrew.
[1:00:45] The light brings gladness.
[1:00:48] The light brings prosperity.
[1:00:51] The light brings happiness. The light is
[1:00:55] intended to make one joyful. God saw the
[1:01:00] light and it was good. I can tell you to
[1:01:03] the bride of Jesus Christ to the elect
[1:01:06] of God. You're a privileged people.
[1:01:10] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:01:11] &gt;&gt; God has given and shown great honor upon
[1:01:14] the upon his children,
[1:01:17] prospered them. How would you like to be
[1:01:20] what you've seen in the world just this
[1:01:22] last week?
[1:01:25] How would you like if you were bound to
[1:01:27] that? How would you like if that's what
[1:01:29] was being fed to you?
[1:01:32] Isn't that incredible?
[1:01:36] You know, we live in a very real world.
[1:01:39] I wonder if anybody
[1:01:41] I'm I'm really mystified at what they
[1:01:43] call music today.
[1:01:46] You hear it in the mall. You hear it in
[1:01:48] every restaurant. It's almost standard.
[1:01:52] Just standard procedure. You can't
[1:01:55] hardly visit. And I hear that there is
[1:01:58] no music. It's just thump thump thump
[1:02:00] thump thump thump thump. Car drives up
[1:02:02] beside you vibrating my car
[1:02:10] &gt;&gt; and I can hear it two, three cars away.
[1:02:13] &gt;&gt; I said, "What is that poor man or that
[1:02:15] poor woman? What's happening to their
[1:02:18] eard drums?
[1:02:19] &gt;&gt; They must be just vibrating.
[1:02:22] And I wonder why are they doing that?
[1:02:26] Why are they listening to that? And
[1:02:29] there's no there's no music. There's
[1:02:30] nothing. There's no melody.
[1:02:35] I was in a restaurant yesterday.
[1:02:38] We're trying to have dinner
[1:02:40] and and
[1:02:43] brother Dave, he said, "Could you turn
[1:02:44] that down a little bit?" And I think
[1:02:46] they actually got a mistake and turned
[1:02:48] it up.
[1:02:50] and we were trying to visit
[1:02:52] and that's partly why I'm horse today
[1:02:54] because I had to yell
[1:02:56] across the table and everybody's
[1:02:59] yelling. You notice everybody yells
[1:03:01] today. Have you heard an advertisement
[1:03:03] on the radio? Nobody talks anymore. Hey
[1:03:07] guys, come hurry. Right. You know,
[1:03:10] &gt;&gt; you've heard that.
[1:03:12] What's the matter with people? Do they
[1:03:14] you know I'm hard of hearing but boy
[1:03:18] that's deafening.
[1:03:21] That's this world.
[1:03:23] &gt;&gt; You know why I think it is? I think
[1:03:25] everybody's scared. I don't know what
[1:03:27] they're trying to, you know, put on a
[1:03:30] front. Oh, we're having a great time and
[1:03:32] we're really happy. Isn't this? And then
[1:03:34] then
[1:03:36] I've watched them. I'm I'm I'm a I'm a
[1:03:38] student of people's faces
[1:03:41] and they come up and say, "Oh, hi. How
[1:03:44] are you today? What you know, isn't that
[1:03:46] wonderful? What would you like?" And all
[1:03:48] the rest of it. and they just barely get
[1:03:49] the words out just
[1:03:53] and are on their way.
[1:03:55] Didn't come from any joy, any happiness.
[1:03:58] That smile is just as fictitious as it
[1:04:01] can be. I'm not being critical. That
[1:04:03] just is the world. They don't have a
[1:04:05] reason to smile. Don't have a reason to
[1:04:09] really be joyful
[1:04:13] because it doesn't come from the place
[1:04:16] where they live.
[1:04:20] The light is good. It's prosperous.
[1:04:24] In the a message tested faith, I'm just
[1:04:28] starting slowly. I want you to get a
[1:04:30] real good foundation here.
[1:04:34] Brother Bram said, "You put a little
[1:04:35] seed under a rock,
[1:04:38] put the rock on top of it, but just as
[1:04:41] sure as the warm sun goes bathing the
[1:04:45] earth. As sure as the warm sun goes
[1:04:48] bathing the earth, little germ of life
[1:04:52] will work its way around the rock and
[1:04:55] stick its head up because you can't hide
[1:04:59] life." Amen.
[1:05:02] &gt;&gt; Now people can hear the same service.
[1:05:04] They can hear the same prophet. They can
[1:05:06] hear the same tape and one comes to life
[1:05:12] &gt;&gt; and one remains in darkness. Can't
[1:05:15] understand. It doesn't mean a thing to
[1:05:18] me. But the next one, you know, and even
[1:05:22] you don't have to understand it, but
[1:05:24] there's a reality.
[1:05:25] &gt;&gt; There's something that vibrates into the
[1:05:28] soul of a person. I don't understand it.
[1:05:31] I've had people say, I could even pick
[1:05:33] all kinds of fault with it, but there's
[1:05:35] something inside of me that is saying
[1:05:37] yes.
[1:05:39] &gt;&gt; There's something responding. That's
[1:05:41] because there's a seed. That's because
[1:05:43] the author who's speaking this now. The
[1:05:47] author who's speaking this is the same
[1:05:50] author, creator who put that seed within
[1:05:53] you that could is waiting for that
[1:05:56] voice.
[1:05:57] &gt;&gt; It's waiting for it.
[1:06:01] Sometimes people don't understand. They
[1:06:03] don't even understand what you perhaps
[1:06:05] believe, but they feel a certain
[1:06:07] atmosphere.
[1:06:10] &gt;&gt; They see something and it registers
[1:06:13] within them. It may even be completely
[1:06:16] contrary to their belief.
[1:06:19] And they'll believe a certain set of
[1:06:21] creeds. And they see as a life
[1:06:24] represented represented within you. and
[1:06:28] they say
[1:06:30] there's a reality. There's something
[1:06:33] genuine that's not put on. That's not
[1:06:36] something that's not a Sunday go to
[1:06:39] meeting religion. This is a reality.
[1:06:42] There is a there's a peace there that
[1:06:45] didn't come from a church. There's a
[1:06:47] peace I can see in that individual.
[1:06:50] There's a shine on their face. There's
[1:06:52] something in the way they look in their
[1:06:54] eyes. There's something just the way
[1:06:57] that they speak, there's a stability,
[1:07:00] there's something there. And you know,
[1:07:03] in an hour,
[1:07:05] in an hour of deep trial, when
[1:07:07] everything's just going along fine, I'm
[1:07:10] thinking of a certain sister right now
[1:07:11] that I know very, very well.
[1:07:15] And uh she happened to be the object of
[1:07:18] a large she come out of a large family
[1:07:21] and she happened to be the object of
[1:07:22] their persecution.
[1:07:24] you're the crazy one. Believing the
[1:07:27] stuff you believe, believing the Bible
[1:07:29] and being the kind of person, being a
[1:07:32] holy ruler or whatever, whatever they
[1:07:34] said down through the years, but finally
[1:07:37] was a member of the family, immediate
[1:07:40] family was taken in death and everyone
[1:07:43] was gathered over here to a town east in
[1:07:46] British Columbia. They gathered and in
[1:07:49] that moment
[1:07:51] in that moment when everybody comes down
[1:07:54] is on even playing field. It's not you
[1:07:57] know what I believe and what I do and
[1:07:59] what you believe and what you think. At
[1:08:01] that moment they're gathered around.
[1:08:05] And the family says to this one who they
[1:08:08] have ridiculed all these years,
[1:08:11] you're the only sane one here.
[1:08:15] You're the only sane one here.
[1:08:21] In the hour that I'm speaking of
[1:08:24] when some are
[1:08:27] invited to enter in,
[1:08:30] you're invited, friends. This isn't this
[1:08:32] isn't some pipe dream. You're going to
[1:08:35] hear it. I don't care who you are.
[1:08:37] You're going to hear it. One or the
[1:08:39] other. You're going to hear enter in.
[1:08:43] You have right to the tree of life.
[1:08:47] &gt;&gt; Come in, ye, beloved of the Lord.
[1:08:51] &gt;&gt; Enter in.
[1:08:53] And without
[1:08:55] are mongers, wararm mongers,
[1:08:59] adulterers, liars,
[1:09:02] and a whole host of people left out.
[1:09:06] That's a final separation. darkness and
[1:09:09] God's word is doing the separating. And
[1:09:12] I can tell you that's not something way
[1:09:14] in the future. That's happening as we
[1:09:17] sit here today and as I speak to you,
[1:09:20] light has risen.
[1:09:23] &gt;&gt; A prophet Elijah has declared, "Light
[1:09:26] has come.
[1:09:27] &gt;&gt; A new day has sprung up.
[1:09:30] &gt;&gt; And I see the dividing between mortal
[1:09:33] and immortality.
[1:09:35] between a new day and the old death of
[1:09:39] denominational years. I see a new day
[1:09:42] arising in the midst of the darkness
[1:09:45] that enshrouded Leodysia.
[1:09:48] I thank God that he gave us a prophet's
[1:09:51] eye who could tell us ahead of time,
[1:09:53] light is coming, folks.
[1:09:56] &gt;&gt; Light is coming. And because it's
[1:09:58] coming, I say this word and I have a
[1:10:00] reason to say it. Shalom, church.
[1:10:04] Shalom, bride.
[1:10:08] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:10:11] &gt;&gt; Am I going to stand here and say you're
[1:10:13] not privileged?
[1:10:15] You're privileged people.
[1:10:20] &gt;&gt; You can't hide life.
[1:10:22] So, you may bury it under stones and in
[1:10:25] the bogs or in the bottom of the sea,
[1:10:29] wherever it may be. But when the Son of
[1:10:31] God comes
[1:10:35] and the warm breezes of eternity begin
[1:10:39] to bathe the earth,
[1:10:42] his bloodwashed children will raise
[1:10:45] their head and give praise to God.
[1:10:49] &gt;&gt; Listen folks,
[1:10:51] excuse me for calling you folks,
[1:10:54] saints. Isn't that literature?
[1:10:58] &gt;&gt; Isn't that a piece of literature?
[1:11:02] We may be buried under stones
[1:11:05] or in bogs
[1:11:07] or in the bottom of the sea, wherever it
[1:11:10] may be. But when the son of God comes
[1:11:14] and the warm breezes of eternity begin
[1:11:16] to bathe the earth, his bloodwashed
[1:11:20] children will raise their head and give
[1:11:22] praise to God.
[1:11:24] &gt;&gt; And now if you put that in the future,
[1:11:27] you've already missed it.
[1:11:31] When this same prophet
[1:11:34] stood before the people and made this
[1:11:36] statement, there is a man here who can
[1:11:41] turn on the light. We're not talking
[1:11:44] about a son of God in the future. We're
[1:11:47] talking about a son of man being
[1:11:49] revealed, a son of God being revealed
[1:11:51] now. And he was introducing him. There
[1:11:53] is a man here. And I feel to say to you
[1:11:57] today without any apology, there is the
[1:12:00] same man here
[1:12:02] &gt;&gt; that can turn on the light.
[1:12:04] &gt;&gt; You may be here with some confusion. You
[1:12:06] may be here with some question. You may
[1:12:09] be here with some decision that needs to
[1:12:11] be made. But I say to you in the name of
[1:12:13] the Lord, there is a man here
[1:12:16] &gt;&gt; that can turn on the light.
[1:12:19] &gt;&gt; Only believe.
[1:12:21] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:12:22] &gt;&gt; Does this congregation believe that?
[1:12:25] There is a man here that can turn on the
[1:12:28] light. And I think you ought to say
[1:12:30] that. You need to say that. We need to
[1:12:33] say that together.
[1:12:35] There is a man here that can turn on the
[1:12:38] light. Let's say it again. There is a
[1:12:41] man here that can turn on the light. All
[1:12:44] glory be to him.
[1:12:46] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:12:47] &gt;&gt; Son of the living God, creator of
[1:12:50] heavens and earth. There's a man here
[1:12:52] that can turn on the light
[1:12:57] &gt;&gt; and with that light comes warmth.
[1:13:01] He said the sun is put here for
[1:13:03] something and down beneath there
[1:13:06] somewhere unseen to the human eye
[1:13:10] is vegetation and life that'll spring
[1:13:13] forth again because that the sun was
[1:13:16] sent for that very same purpose. God
[1:13:20] sent the sun. And now I need to bring
[1:13:24] something to you.
[1:13:27] God has put all the heavenly bodies in
[1:13:30] their orbit.
[1:13:32] And this earth is in such a uh
[1:13:36] precarious. And yet if it was just to
[1:13:39] move some degrees
[1:13:42] off, we'd either cook
[1:13:46] and be destroyed by that or by cold.
[1:13:52] We're in a very very critical
[1:13:56] orbit.
[1:13:58] And brother Brandham speaks of it in
[1:14:00] different places is when the earth moves
[1:14:03] around
[1:14:04] comes into a certain position
[1:14:07] has to be in that position and the same
[1:14:10] sun now the sun is shining all the time
[1:14:12] and I'm speaking about the son of the
[1:14:14] son of god is shining all the time but
[1:14:18] there had to be a portion of the earth
[1:14:20] and I'm thinking of earth as humanity
[1:14:23] now and a portion of the earth that
[1:14:26] moves into a certain position position
[1:14:28] at a certain season of time down through
[1:14:32] the centuries of time and the earth
[1:14:35] moved in its orbit. The people, there's
[1:14:38] new masses of people, new nations and
[1:14:43] people were multiplied and covered the
[1:14:45] face of the earth. Where did the people
[1:14:47] come from? Out of the earth. Our bodies
[1:14:50] came out of the earth. Just a little
[1:14:53] different form. That's all. Your mothers
[1:14:55] ate the food that came from the earth
[1:14:58] and the chemistry that gave the plants
[1:15:00] and botney life and the vegetation and
[1:15:03] and the fruit and the herbs and so on.
[1:15:06] And that's where your body came from out
[1:15:08] of the earth and it'll go back to the
[1:15:10] earth. But God brought the bodies here
[1:15:14] for a certain purpose. But the same sun
[1:15:16] shines on the earth that has no seed in
[1:15:19] it. The same sun shines on the stones
[1:15:23] that have no life and no seed in it. But
[1:15:25] then there is a portion of the earth
[1:15:27] that has is has is got seed within it.
[1:15:31] And that same sun warms the earth. And
[1:15:35] that seed comes to life.
[1:15:38] &gt;&gt; And it comes rising out of the earth or
[1:15:41] rising out of the bog, rising out of all
[1:15:44] of the muck. And it comes to shine forth
[1:15:47] in the glory of God because that's what
[1:15:50] it was ordained to do.
[1:15:58] in Victoria, British Columbia,
[1:16:01] where the prophet of God preached, "God
[1:16:04] has a provided way."
[1:16:07] Said, "God sends
[1:16:09] God sends his weepers
[1:16:12] and mourers.
[1:16:14] He sends it forth which is the water and
[1:16:18] it drops down like great big tears
[1:16:22] as we have today.
[1:16:24] He sends his weepers and his mourers. We
[1:16:28] have a dark perhaps and a dismal day
[1:16:31] such as we're having even at this time
[1:16:34] and the tears and buries the little
[1:16:36] seeds which is happening at this moment.
[1:16:40] And down beneath the ground it goes as
[1:16:43] it packs down. And then along comes the
[1:16:46] winter blizzard and sweeps across the
[1:16:50] country. And the little petals gone, the
[1:16:54] leaves drop off and the stalks gone,
[1:16:58] the bulbs dried up and the little seed
[1:17:02] freezes and bursts open and the pulp
[1:17:06] runs out of it. Poor little flower.
[1:17:11] Looks like the end of it. Oh no, it's
[1:17:14] not the end of it. When the warm sun
[1:17:18] begins to come back around again.
[1:17:21] Hallelujah. And the earth moving itself
[1:17:25] in position. The earth is moving itself.
[1:17:29] This earth is moving itself in position
[1:17:32] to the sun. He said it moves into
[1:17:35] position of the sun. There's a germ of
[1:17:37] life somewhere in that dirt that no
[1:17:41] science has ever been able to find.
[1:17:46] &gt;&gt; No theologian will ever figure out
[1:17:49] what's in you.
[1:17:51] &gt;&gt; No science will ever find that seed
[1:17:54] that's in you.
[1:17:57] &gt;&gt; How do I know it's there? Oh, just let
[1:18:00] this earth move into a certain position
[1:18:04] and let the warmth of that sun, that man
[1:18:07] that can turn on the light here, let him
[1:18:10] just shine down and it doesn't matter
[1:18:12] what kind of rock you're under, what
[1:18:14] kind of cement or weight you're under,
[1:18:16] what kind of burden you're under, that
[1:18:18] life will come out.
[1:18:22] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:18:23] &gt;&gt; Doesn't matter what kind of question you
[1:18:24] have in your life and what you're facing
[1:18:27] with. what you're faced with. Doesn't
[1:18:29] matter what age you're at. I can tell
[1:18:31] you whether you're a teenager, whether
[1:18:34] you're a pre-teen, whether you're a
[1:18:36] single or a married or burdened or
[1:18:38] whatever mo or confused or depressed.
[1:18:42] I tell you what, I would put that I'd
[1:18:45] put that rock, that slab of depression
[1:18:49] directly under the bright light of the
[1:18:51] son of the God. Hallelujah. and let that
[1:18:54] seed that's underneath, let that life
[1:18:57] come loose.
[1:19:00] &gt;&gt; Give it a chance.
[1:19:03] &gt;&gt; Move it into his presence.
[1:19:05] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:19:07] &gt;&gt; If you just stay out there on the on the
[1:19:09] shopping track or stay out there on the
[1:19:12] treadmill of life, just going going
[1:19:14] going, you're not giving a chance. But
[1:19:17] bring that burden that you have. Bring
[1:19:19] it into this kind of an atmosphere.
[1:19:22] bring that impossibility
[1:19:24] into this kind of an atmosphere. I tell
[1:19:27] you, there's a man here
[1:19:30] &gt;&gt; that'll turn on the light,
[1:19:33] &gt;&gt; this morning,
[1:19:34] &gt;&gt; today,
[1:19:36] &gt;&gt; right now,
[1:19:39] &gt;&gt; let him turn on the light.
[1:19:42] &gt;&gt; Don't belittle him.
[1:19:45] &gt;&gt; Don't belittle this son of man.
[1:19:47] &gt;&gt; Don't belittle this.
[1:19:51] He's present.
[1:19:55] &gt;&gt; He said when the warm sun begins to come
[1:19:58] back around and the earth moving itself
[1:20:00] in position of the sun, there's a germ
[1:20:04] of life somewhere in that dirt. No
[1:20:06] science has been able to find and that
[1:20:09] flower that flower
[1:20:12] lives again.
[1:20:14] Why?
[1:20:15] It served God's purpose.
[1:20:20] It served God's purpose in God's
[1:20:22] provided way and he made a way for it to
[1:20:26] live again.
[1:20:28] I was sitting in this meeting but I
[1:20:30] don't remember him saying that.
[1:20:33] I was sitting on the platform
[1:20:36] but it means more to me today
[1:20:39] over 40 years later
[1:20:42] than it did then.
[1:20:45] I didn't remember it then but I remember
[1:20:46] it now. And I remember it as a great
[1:20:49] powerful truth because I've read it in
[1:20:52] many messages
[1:20:54] and I have experienced it
[1:20:57] and I have found that this son of man
[1:21:00] that was revealed
[1:21:02] under this ministry that there is no
[1:21:04] darkness
[1:21:05] &gt;&gt; so dark there's nothing so dismal but
[1:21:10] what this son can dispel.
[1:21:13] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:21:18] You think I'm going to preach like this
[1:21:19] and not praise God?
[1:21:20] &gt;&gt; I'm going to praise God. This is a
[1:21:22] reality to me. I've been waiting for
[1:21:24] this moment. I've been waiting for this
[1:21:26] morning. I want to give him glory.
[1:21:29] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. There isn't enough devils in
[1:21:31] hell to stop me.
[1:21:34] &gt;&gt; Not enough devils in hell to put a cloud
[1:21:37] upon this congregation of people and the
[1:21:39] believers and the bride of Jesus Christ.
[1:21:42] There is no cloud that can succeed. the
[1:21:45] sun will shine through and has shone
[1:21:47] through upon it.
[1:21:52] &gt;&gt; So Almighty God ordained that the earth
[1:21:54] would move
[1:21:57] in its position in its season into
[1:22:01] position
[1:22:03] with the sun to warm the earth and bring
[1:22:07] forth life.
[1:22:09] In its season, the spirit of God moves
[1:22:14] upon the earth.
[1:22:16] Now,
[1:22:19] as I said earlier, your body, the one
[1:22:22] you're sitting in right now, was nothing
[1:22:25] more than some chemistry of the earth
[1:22:29] before you were born.
[1:22:32] Your bodies were laying here. Every one
[1:22:35] of our bodies was laying here when Jesus
[1:22:37] hung on the cross.
[1:22:39] And when his blood dropped down and when
[1:22:42] God saw the blood of that new creation,
[1:22:47] the new creation, a new life, a new
[1:22:50] species,
[1:22:52] &gt;&gt; one that had not come in Eden's
[1:22:56] creation, this was a new creation. This
[1:22:59] was the creator of Eden coming in
[1:23:02] another form, in the form of humanity.
[1:23:06] so he could be a kinsman redeemer. And
[1:23:09] he hung there now, a new species.
[1:23:13] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And the life from that blood
[1:23:16] dropped down to the earth. And almighty
[1:23:19] God took the abstract title of the earth
[1:23:22] and said, "It's mine." And you were
[1:23:24] laying there then. Hallelujah. There
[1:23:27] were stones in the earth. There was bog
[1:23:29] on the earth. There's all kinds of stuff
[1:23:32] on the earth. But there was some earth
[1:23:34] that had seed in it,
[1:23:37] &gt;&gt; ordained by the mind of God before the
[1:23:40] foundation of the world. Before he made
[1:23:42] the earth,
[1:23:43] &gt;&gt; he saw the plan in the program.
[1:23:48] You were laying in the earth then, but
[1:23:51] he didn't bring you. He didn't bring
[1:23:54] forth. The spirit of God didn't move
[1:23:58] on that part of the earth that made your
[1:24:00] body. He didn't move on you to bring you
[1:24:04] up at the time that Jesus walked here.
[1:24:07] He could have, but he didn't.
[1:24:10] He didn't move on you to bring the part
[1:24:12] of the earth that you are. He didn't
[1:24:14] move on you to bring you up during the
[1:24:16] dark ages, but he could have. He didn't
[1:24:20] move to bring on you bring you up on
[1:24:23] that part of the earth. He didn't move
[1:24:25] you into position.
[1:24:27] The spirit of God was moving on earth
[1:24:29] but didn't move on that particular part
[1:24:31] that you are to bring you up in Luther's
[1:24:34] time or in Wesley's time or in the
[1:24:38] Pentecost time. But he moved upon you.
[1:24:42] He began to move the earth into a
[1:24:44] certain position when you were not here
[1:24:47] yet. You were not aware. You were not
[1:24:50] conscious.
[1:24:52] And he moved upon that part of the
[1:24:54] earth.
[1:24:56] It came forth
[1:24:58] by a natural
[1:25:00] sexual relationship between a husband
[1:25:03] and a wife. And you came forth and were
[1:25:07] issued out into the world with a seed in
[1:25:10] you,
[1:25:13] waiting
[1:25:15] for the sun
[1:25:17] &gt;&gt; to shine on it.
[1:25:21] &gt;&gt; Oh, blessed be his name.
[1:25:26] And you wandered wherever you wandered,
[1:25:28] maybe into this church, into that
[1:25:30] church, maybe on the streets and in sin
[1:25:33] in all kinds of things. But one day,
[1:25:37] &gt;&gt; one day, even against your own will,
[1:25:40] &gt;&gt; you may have even been antagonistic
[1:25:43] against this message and against the the
[1:25:47] the very sound of it. It it irritated
[1:25:51] you perhaps or yet perhaps you were
[1:25:53] waiting for it and when you heard it
[1:25:56] says, "Oh, what blessed thing is this
[1:25:58] that I'm hearing?"
[1:26:01] &gt;&gt; I think of our sister Marjorie Miles.
[1:26:06] Sister Marjorie lived in the same
[1:26:08] apartment with Sister Lana.
[1:26:10] I never forget Sister Lana. Some of
[1:26:13] these testimonies, you know, you never
[1:26:16] hear them. So, I give little bits and
[1:26:18] pieces while we go along and I know
[1:26:20] they're not embarrassed and if they are,
[1:26:22] they forgive me.
[1:26:25] Sister Lana had come to a wedding
[1:26:29] and
[1:26:30] she was a, you know, she was really
[1:26:34] dressed nice and fashionable and all
[1:26:37] decked out with her earrings and all the
[1:26:40] jewelry and stuff, you know.
[1:26:43] and she came to this wedding
[1:26:46] and the Lord gripped her heart at the
[1:26:48] wedding
[1:26:49] and uh few days later, I don't know when
[1:26:53] it was, it wasn't just a few days later,
[1:26:56] she's back at the church hearing the
[1:26:59] message preached and a deacon comes up
[1:27:02] and says, "Lana wants to be baptized."
[1:27:06] Oh, do I have to talk to her?
[1:27:10] I'm not going to take her to the tank
[1:27:11] with all that jewelry hanging on her.
[1:27:14] Oh, when does she want to be baptized?
[1:27:16] Now, today, of course, that's Sister
[1:27:18] Lana. God bless you, Sister Lana. And
[1:27:22] so, I said, I I'll come back and see her
[1:27:24] as soon as I finished preaching. And I
[1:27:26] came back to the and she's walking
[1:27:28] alongside of me. I remember very
[1:27:29] clearly. He is right on my right hand
[1:27:31] side. We're just walking down. I said,
[1:27:32] "Now, Sister Lana," I said, "You know, I
[1:27:35] need to talk." Yes, brother. Yes. Yes.
[1:27:37] Oh, yes. Yes. I said, "No, no, no. You
[1:27:39] know, I was trying to settle her down."
[1:27:40] I said, "No, I I need to talk to you
[1:27:42] about a few things." I said, "You know,
[1:27:44] uh, I couldn't take you to the tank with
[1:27:46] all that jewelry on." "Oh, no." She
[1:27:48] said, "God's already spoken to me." She
[1:27:50] says, "She, I already taken it off." So,
[1:27:52] during the service, she had it all in
[1:27:53] her hand. And I said, "Well, who am I?
[1:27:57] God's already speaking to her. God's
[1:27:58] already dealing with her." We took her
[1:28:00] to the tank and she's never left.
[1:28:04] So, she's now she's up there and said
[1:28:06] she's listening to that prophet's voice
[1:28:08] and sounding out, you know, and and uh
[1:28:11] the walls of some of these apartments
[1:28:13] are not all that soundproof. And so,
[1:28:15] it's actually going through I think I
[1:28:17] think Sister Marjgery's on another
[1:28:19] floor, wasn't she? Floor below you or
[1:28:21] something or above you. Okay. The floor
[1:28:23] above her. And uh so sister Marjorie
[1:28:26] thought, "What is that sound?" You know,
[1:28:28] I wonder what station that is. So, she's
[1:28:32] clicking the television. She can't get
[1:28:34] anything there. And she's dialing the
[1:28:36] radio and trying to find what station
[1:28:38] that's on. Just can't find it on. So,
[1:28:41] she goes downstairs and walking down the
[1:28:43] hall, you know, trying to find out what
[1:28:46] door that is in.
[1:28:49] And comes to Lana's door and hears this
[1:28:52] prophet screaming out, says, "What
[1:28:54] station are you listening to?" "Oh, just
[1:28:56] come on in and find out. I'm tuned into
[1:28:59] the heavenly radio.
[1:29:01] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. That's how come those
[1:29:04] sisters are here. What was it? It was a
[1:29:07] seed.
[1:29:08] &gt;&gt; So one while one wants to turn it aside,
[1:29:10] but God, he's he's not affected by that.
[1:29:13] He just keeps pulling that person until
[1:29:16] they surrender.
[1:29:17] &gt;&gt; The next person, Brother Mil comes in
[1:29:20] say, "I got to get I got to get somebody
[1:29:22] out of that false doctrine. I got to get
[1:29:25] somebody out of that cult." and comes in
[1:29:27] and God nails him.
[1:29:29] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. So there's one side of it
[1:29:31] and there's the other side of it. And
[1:29:33] somehow whatever happens, they come
[1:29:36] directly under the sunlight.
[1:29:39] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:29:40] &gt;&gt; And that sunlight brings life to the
[1:29:43] seed.
[1:29:49] &gt;&gt; It's ordained in its season.
[1:29:54] There came a season. Just hold that now.
[1:30:01] There was words that were spoken by a
[1:30:04] man and his name was Isaiah.
[1:30:09] The spirit of God came upon him and he
[1:30:12] said, "For he shall go up before him
[1:30:16] as a tender plant
[1:30:19] and a root out of dry ground."
[1:30:22] That seed word just laid there.
[1:30:27] And Jeremiah said, "Behold, the days
[1:30:31] come, saith the Lord, that I will raise
[1:30:34] unto David a righteous branch, and a
[1:30:38] king shall reign and prosper, and shall
[1:30:41] execute judgment and justice in the
[1:30:43] earth."
[1:30:48] One day
[1:30:52] came this one,
[1:30:54] this branch,
[1:30:58] this rose of Sharon.
[1:31:03] He came walking
[1:31:06] to John, his second cousin, in the
[1:31:10] water.
[1:31:14] John said, "I have need to be baptized
[1:31:16] of thee. Come thou to me." And this was
[1:31:19] a very special event. And John baptized
[1:31:22] him,
[1:31:26] this branch.
[1:31:29] I'd like to They said there's no beauty
[1:31:32] in him that we should desire him.
[1:31:37] And yet,
[1:31:39] brother Brandham said three times, I
[1:31:41] believe it was, that he saw him.
[1:31:44] Said no artist could ever capture
[1:31:49] that face.
[1:31:52] He said it seemed if he would open his
[1:31:55] mouth and speak,
[1:31:57] the world would pass away.
[1:32:02] So for one, it's very different than for
[1:32:05] the other.
[1:32:09] I wonder if the brothers would just help
[1:32:10] me.
[1:32:13] I need to go down
[1:32:21] be the 17th. It says a rose of Sharon.
[1:32:25] If you could put that up for me.
[1:32:30] Maybe we could just dim the lights a
[1:32:32] little bit if you wouldn't mind.
[1:32:44] He shall grow up before him as a tender
[1:32:46] plant
[1:32:48] and as a root out of dry ground.
[1:32:51] You bring me the next one, please.
[1:32:58] This actually is a tree is a rose of
[1:33:02] Sharon.
[1:33:08] And there's quite a wide variety of its
[1:33:11] appearance. Of course, he's so different
[1:33:13] from so many different sides.
[1:33:18] That's a rose of Sharon.
[1:33:23] That's a rose of Sharon.
[1:33:27] That's a rose of Sharon.
[1:33:31] That's also rose of Sharon. Looks like a
[1:33:34] bee getting some sweetness out of it.
[1:33:44] You can give me the lights now, please.
[1:33:51] So he would come
[1:33:57] that part of the earth that made the
[1:33:59] body of Jesus.
[1:34:03] God in his fore orained plan now must
[1:34:06] bring
[1:34:08] this kinsman redeemer.
[1:34:11] An archangel couldn't do it. Gabriel
[1:34:13] couldn't do it. Wormwood couldn't do it.
[1:34:15] None of the angels, none of the ar
[1:34:17] saraphims couldn't do it. Cherubams
[1:34:20] couldn't do it. No one could do it. It
[1:34:22] had to be a man.
[1:34:25] And God
[1:34:28] shine on that part of the earth and came
[1:34:31] the body of Jesus Christ.
[1:34:35] Listen to me. Many people touched that
[1:34:37] body and got nothing as I said. And yet
[1:34:42] a woman just came squeezed through the
[1:34:45] people and got a hold of the garment,
[1:34:47] his garment. She said, "If I must, if I
[1:34:50] may but touch his garment, I'll be
[1:34:52] whole." And somehow that touch of her
[1:34:55] physical hand upon his garment and the
[1:34:58] chemistry of her body was changed and
[1:35:01] her issue of blood ceased.
[1:35:04] &gt;&gt; What kind of power is this? This is a
[1:35:06] creator.
[1:35:08] Amen.
[1:35:11] &gt;&gt; There was a man there
[1:35:13] that could turn on the light
[1:35:18] &gt;&gt; for her dilemma, for her situation. One
[1:35:21] of the greatest I think one of the
[1:35:23] greatest lies that Satan uh purports and
[1:35:27] imposes upon the people of this
[1:35:29] generation is that your situation is
[1:35:31] kind of beyond help. Your situation
[1:35:34] can't really be answered. Your question
[1:35:37] can't really be solved. That's not true.
[1:35:41] &gt;&gt; There's a man here that can turn on the
[1:35:45] light.
[1:35:46] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:35:47] &gt;&gt; And nothing shall be impossible with
[1:35:49] him. Or to them that believe, nothing
[1:35:52] shall be impossible.
[1:35:54] &gt;&gt; So, well, that's the way I am and that's
[1:35:55] the way I'm built and that's the way
[1:35:57] that goes part of my heritage. I can
[1:36:00] announce to you, you've got a heavenly
[1:36:03] heavenly parent
[1:36:05] &gt;&gt; and you have a heavenly nature that's
[1:36:08] available to you
[1:36:10] &gt;&gt; in the name of Jesus Christ.
[1:36:12] &gt;&gt; There's a man here that can turn on the
[1:36:14] light.
[1:36:15] &gt;&gt; You need to allow yourself, yield
[1:36:17] yourself, bring yourself into that
[1:36:20] divine presence and say, "Oh God, it'll
[1:36:24] take time.
[1:36:26] It may take some solitude.
[1:36:29] It may take some evenings. It may take
[1:36:32] to cancel some other things.
[1:36:39] &gt;&gt; And thus he came forth and could say,
[1:36:41] "I'm the true vine,
[1:36:45] and my father is the husbandman.
[1:36:48] Every branch in me that beareth not
[1:36:51] fruit, he taketh away.
[1:36:54] And every branch that beareth fruit, he
[1:36:57] purgth it may bring forth more fruit.
[1:37:00] Have you felt a purging? Have you felt a
[1:37:03] conviction? Have you felt a greater
[1:37:05] sense of responsibility and commitment
[1:37:09] that is the Holy Spirit
[1:37:11] &gt;&gt; purging us that we might bring forth
[1:37:13] more fruit? I say God bless you
[1:37:16] branches.
[1:37:18] God bless you, branches of the true
[1:37:20] vine. If we aren't, where are we?
[1:37:30] And then
[1:37:32] he came and announced,
[1:37:35] "Oh,
[1:37:37] you help me. You're listening so nice,
[1:37:40] but I'm so full."
[1:37:44] There was a certain part of the earth
[1:37:46] that was laying there waiting, waiting.
[1:37:49] They didn't raise it. didn't bring him
[1:37:51] forth in the dark ages and didn't bring
[1:37:54] him forth in Apostle Paul's time or
[1:37:57] Luther's time or down through the great
[1:38:01] men that brought forth the gospel and
[1:38:04] the Wesley's and the Sankis and all of
[1:38:06] these men
[1:38:08] and I could name many of them didn't
[1:38:11] bring them forth at that time but God in
[1:38:14] his season brought forth a piece of clay
[1:38:19] &gt;&gt; that we would know as William Brennham,
[1:38:22] born to a an alcoholic father
[1:38:28] who made whiskey in his still.
[1:38:32] And even that boy carrying water, you
[1:38:36] couldn't find anything so dark and
[1:38:37] dismal as that and of a Catholic
[1:38:40] background
[1:38:42] just by dead profession. And he's
[1:38:45] carrying water for his father's
[1:38:47] alcoholic system.
[1:38:49] and hears a wind. I tell you, God knows
[1:38:54] how to get the attention of his people.
[1:38:57] &gt;&gt; He knows how to get the attention of his
[1:38:58] servants. And he hears a voice.
[1:39:03] &gt;&gt; Don't drink or smoke or defile your body
[1:39:06] in any way. When you get older,
[1:39:10] there's a work for you. I have a work
[1:39:12] for you.
[1:39:15] Never forgot that.
[1:39:22] Some of you know, most of you know
[1:39:26] I sat with a woman,
[1:39:31] my wife and I
[1:39:34] in brother Homer Brown's church
[1:39:37] in his office.
[1:39:39] and she was a woman when a young as a
[1:39:42] young lady
[1:39:44] that brother Brandham liked very very
[1:39:46] much.
[1:39:49] I said, "Did you know he was a prophet?"
[1:39:52] She said, "No,
[1:39:55] he did tell me that he heard voices
[1:39:58] that would speak to him out of the trees
[1:40:02] and wind
[1:40:04] and that something would speak to him.
[1:40:09] God knows how to get attention of his
[1:40:12] people.
[1:40:15] And it might have only been eight or 10
[1:40:17] years old and you boys that are sitting
[1:40:18] on the front seat, but God knows how to
[1:40:21] speak to you.
[1:40:22] &gt;&gt; You young ladies, God knows how to speak
[1:40:24] to you. He knows how to get your
[1:40:26] attention. You either have to believe
[1:40:28] you've been born to be destroyed and
[1:40:30] lost or I've been born I was brought
[1:40:32] into this church. I was brought under
[1:40:34] the sound of this message because
[1:40:36] there's a seed within me and it does
[1:40:39] speak to me
[1:40:41] &gt;&gt; and there's a reality that I cannot get
[1:40:44] away from
[1:40:55] &gt;&gt; and that vessel grew to be a man. Are
[1:40:58] you weary or can I carry on?
[1:41:02] Hallelujah.
[1:41:04] &gt;&gt; Because laying in the word of God,
[1:41:07] laying a word, laying, waiting to be
[1:41:09] manifested, waiting for the son of
[1:41:12] righteousness to shine upon a certain
[1:41:15] promise, a certain word. And the word
[1:41:17] says, "And unto the angel." And here's
[1:41:20] John the apostle seeing things that
[1:41:23] would be in the future. And he's being
[1:41:26] instructed by Jesus Christ because he's
[1:41:29] the author of the book of Revelation. I
[1:41:31] Jesus.
[1:41:33] &gt;&gt; Oh, that's wonderful. I Jesus, I'm the
[1:41:36] author of this. I'm the one that sent
[1:41:39] this word to you.
[1:41:41] &gt;&gt; Write these things.
[1:41:43] I Jesus, the man, the man that's here,
[1:41:48] if you can accept it. The man that can
[1:41:51] turn on the light if you can accept it.
[1:41:53] The pillar of fire that stood with the
[1:41:55] prophet of God for 30 years and more.
[1:41:58] That same man, if we put in the past,
[1:42:01] you've lost it. If you put in the
[1:42:03] future, you've lost it. You got to put
[1:42:05] it right here this day, September the
[1:42:07] 30th, 2007, there's a man here that can
[1:42:11] turn on the light.
[1:42:13] &gt;&gt; I don't care what age you are. I don't
[1:42:15] care what you think about your life or
[1:42:17] your future, whatever more.
[1:42:20] &gt;&gt; There's a man here,
[1:42:22] &gt;&gt; that can heal you. Amen.
[1:42:23] &gt;&gt; There's a man here and he's called the
[1:42:25] baptizer with the Holy Ghost and fire.
[1:42:29] That man is here. You need to be
[1:42:31] baptized. You don't want to leave it
[1:42:33] till tomorrow. You don't want to leave
[1:42:35] it here for another year. You ought to
[1:42:37] believe it now.
[1:42:39] &gt;&gt; Say, "How can I believe it? Who brought
[1:42:41] you here?"
[1:42:44] &gt;&gt; Just a mother and a father brought you
[1:42:45] here. I say no.
[1:42:47] &gt;&gt; They were only human instruments that
[1:42:49] somehow collected a certain chemistry
[1:42:52] out of the earth. That is your body and
[1:42:55] you're sitting here. But God, almighty
[1:42:59] God, put a seed there before the
[1:43:01] foundation of the world, waiting for the
[1:43:03] sun to shine on it at this time, at this
[1:43:06] season.
[1:43:10] &gt;&gt; That is why you see things very
[1:43:12] different
[1:43:13] from others.
[1:43:19] He said, "And unto the angel of the
[1:43:22] church of the leadyans, write these
[1:43:25] things Seth the amen." And he says
[1:43:28] different words here than he has to any
[1:43:30] of the other church ages. And never uses
[1:43:32] this phrase to any of the other six
[1:43:34] messengers.
[1:43:36] Right?
[1:43:38] These things say the amen. I'm the amen.
[1:43:41] I am the so be it.
[1:43:44] I'm the conclusion.
[1:43:46] &gt;&gt; You say, "Amen."
[1:43:47] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:43:48] &gt;&gt; I'm the amen, the faithful and true
[1:43:52] witness.
[1:43:54] The beginning of the creation of God. I
[1:43:58] am the new seed.
[1:44:00] &gt;&gt; I'm the super seed.
[1:44:02] &gt;&gt; I'm a new generation.
[1:44:04] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. I'm another species.
[1:44:07] &gt;&gt; I'm the new creation.
[1:44:10] &gt;&gt; Oh, are you with me?
[1:44:14] This is the one I'm speaking to. My last
[1:44:17] messenger, a prophet messenger. And I
[1:44:20] will send you and you will tell them,
[1:44:22] you're the last one in my hand. And I'm
[1:44:24] sending you forth to the concluding
[1:44:27] generation, the last age. And that same
[1:44:31] son,
[1:44:33] the earth was moving in its orbit and
[1:44:36] coming to this Leodysian age. And in the
[1:44:39] earth
[1:44:40] was bodies
[1:44:42] of humans
[1:44:44] that will come forth out of the earth
[1:44:48] for whom this one would be a prophet
[1:44:51] messenger sent.
[1:44:53] &gt;&gt; Go tell them behold I send Elijah I sent
[1:44:59] Elijah the prophet before the great and
[1:45:02] the terrible terrible day. Terrible
[1:45:04] because it's a day of judgment. Terrible
[1:45:06] because it's a day of uh it's a day of
[1:45:09] violence and wickedness. Terrible
[1:45:11] because it's a day of darkness. Terrible
[1:45:14] darkness. Gross darkness. Not gross
[1:45:18] darkness only. Gross darkness upon the
[1:45:21] people.
[1:45:26] &gt;&gt; Listen friends, let's be mature.
[1:45:30] &gt;&gt; What you're seeing
[1:45:32] &gt;&gt; is the fulfillment of that scripture.
[1:45:35] And that's why he gets up in shalom and
[1:45:38] comes with that diverse message.
[1:45:42] Shalom.
[1:45:44] &gt;&gt; Peace.
[1:45:46] Peace to the bride. Peace to the church.
[1:45:49] Shalom. And the reason I say that is
[1:45:52] because
[1:45:54] God is now separating.
[1:45:57] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:45:58] same as it was in Eden. He's now
[1:46:01] separating the light from the darkness.
[1:46:04] He's now he's now introducing a message.
[1:46:09] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:46:10] &gt;&gt; And what is light? Light is the word of
[1:46:14] God made manifest.
[1:46:16] &gt;&gt; Now here you were as seeds laying in the
[1:46:19] earth. But here was also seeds laying in
[1:46:23] the scripture, the word of God. laying
[1:46:27] there for this season, waiting until
[1:46:30] there would be uh something to unite
[1:46:33] with it. And here comes a vessel. The
[1:46:36] vessel that is to unite with behold I
[1:46:38] send Elijah the prophet. Here comes here
[1:46:42] comes the seed now born of a man and
[1:46:45] born of a woman
[1:46:48] comes into the world.
[1:46:51] And there's a scripture there's a
[1:46:53] there's a seed laying there when the day
[1:46:59] will be like the days of Noah.
[1:47:02] They'll plant and they'll build
[1:47:06] be prosperity.
[1:47:08] It'll be the days of Sodom once again.
[1:47:12] And the day when Elohim himself must
[1:47:16] come in a body of flesh and visit his
[1:47:20] son and tell him now is the season. Now
[1:47:24] is the season, not only for Leodysia,
[1:47:27] not only for Noah's time, Sodom's time,
[1:47:30] but now is the season when a messenger
[1:47:33] comes in a body of flesh to speak to
[1:47:36] Abraham's royal seed, his children, and
[1:47:41] tell them the son they've been waiting
[1:47:43] for is now on the scene.
[1:47:46] Friends, that is why that is why this
[1:47:49] man as you call you a prophet. That is
[1:47:52] why he had to say so many places,
[1:47:55] show me the father.
[1:47:58] &gt;&gt; When we come to the end of the service,
[1:47:59] he showed the people the father.
[1:48:02] &gt;&gt; Let us see Jesus,
[1:48:04] &gt;&gt; sir. I would see Jesus. That's what he
[1:48:07] was here for to show them who Jesus was.
[1:48:10] &gt;&gt; That's why he was telling them, who did
[1:48:11] the man touch? Who did the woman touch?
[1:48:13] Not me. They're 30 feet, 40 feet from
[1:48:16] me. I'm at the pulpit. It's Jesus. They
[1:48:18] were touching Jesus.
[1:48:20] &gt;&gt; It touched the high priest
[1:48:22] &gt;&gt; cuz he was here and he was asking them,
[1:48:24] "Who is this Melkisedc? Who is he?" Not,
[1:48:28] "Who is this Aaron?
[1:48:30] Not some other high priest. Who is this
[1:48:31] Melzdc?"
[1:48:33] And Melzdc a priesthood. Another order.
[1:48:37] &gt;&gt; What kind of order without beginning or
[1:48:40] ending of days? There had to be another
[1:48:43] order come in
[1:48:45] &gt;&gt; without father without mother without
[1:48:48] beginning or ending of days. Who is
[1:48:50] this?
[1:48:52] &gt;&gt; And then the seals are open. And later
[1:48:55] on
[1:48:57] says there's a man here
[1:49:00] that can turn on the light.
[1:49:05] In the message one of them show us the
[1:49:07] father. He asked the people, "Would you
[1:49:10] like to see the father?"
[1:49:14] Think where that piece of clay.
[1:49:18] He tried to tell the people, "If you
[1:49:20] only knew
[1:49:22] what I go through,
[1:49:25] &gt;&gt; I'm standing here in two worlds."
[1:49:32] Then he says, "I see a light.
[1:49:37] And as I look into that light,
[1:49:40] something materializes and I see a
[1:49:42] person
[1:49:44] and I see
[1:49:46] certain things about that person. I'm
[1:49:49] able to tell them and one occasion I'm
[1:49:52] looking in this light and a woman is
[1:49:55] there
[1:49:57] says and you think you have cancer.
[1:50:03] You talk about a cloud.
[1:50:06] You talk about a darkness. There's
[1:50:08] people here who have experienced cancer.
[1:50:11] There's people here who've even been
[1:50:12] told by mistake you got cancer and put
[1:50:16] them through test and they go home
[1:50:20] driving in their car from the hospital
[1:50:22] from the doctor's office.
[1:50:26] I'm a healthy, strong man. I got cancer.
[1:50:30] My life is ending. My children will be
[1:50:34] fatherless.
[1:50:36] My wife will be a widow. This is
[1:50:38] impossible. I can't accept that. Doctor
[1:50:42] said, "You got cancer." And here, "What
[1:50:44] a cloud. What a darkness. What a dismal
[1:50:47] day that would be." And the woman is
[1:50:50] standing there.
[1:50:53] She's been examined. She has physical
[1:50:56] ailment. And the doctors have told her,
[1:50:58] "You have cancer."
[1:51:01] What a glorious light.
[1:51:04] went another piece of clay.
[1:51:07] &gt;&gt; The doctor came out of the earth and
[1:51:09] William Brham came out of the earth. I
[1:51:13] have no problem with the doctor. He's
[1:51:14] doing his best. But now I have a
[1:51:17] messenger. Says they told you you have
[1:51:20] cancer, but you don't have cancer.
[1:51:24] &gt;&gt; Oh, thank God for the light.
[1:51:27] &gt;&gt; Thank God for this kind of light.
[1:51:30] &gt;&gt; Thank God for what materialized out of
[1:51:31] the light.
[1:51:34] Hallelujah.
[1:51:39] &gt;&gt; It's hard for me to preach.
[1:51:42] &gt;&gt; This light is so wonderful.
[1:51:53] Brother said, "Mary,
[1:51:57] she saw this light
[1:52:02] and a man materialized out of the
[1:52:04] light."
[1:52:06] He said, "I'm Gabriel.
[1:52:09] I've been sent from the presence of God
[1:52:13] to tell you that which is conceived in
[1:52:15] thee is of the Holy Ghost.
[1:52:20] You can see follow
[1:52:22] always that way.
[1:52:25] Then comes this man. He's a He just so
[1:52:28] full of
[1:52:30] so antagonistic. He's so gripped with a
[1:52:34] violent faith. His name is Saul.
[1:52:38] And he came before the leaders and say
[1:52:41] just give me letters and I'll do
[1:52:44] something with these so-called
[1:52:46] Christians.
[1:52:47] I'll imprison them. I'll put them where
[1:52:49] they belong. And he has letters in his
[1:52:52] hand. And he's on his way to Damascus
[1:52:57] to get these Christians. And behold,
[1:53:00] there's a great light. The light is so
[1:53:02] great. And he's struck down off of his
[1:53:04] mount to the ground. And he knows that
[1:53:07] holy divine presence which is permeating
[1:53:10] him. Who art thou Lord?
[1:53:13] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:53:15] And a voice from the light said, "I am
[1:53:18] Jesus.
[1:53:20] &gt;&gt; I'm Jesus."
[1:53:23] &gt;&gt; The man that could turn on the light.
[1:53:26] &gt;&gt; And the light was turned on for the
[1:53:28] Apostle Paul. And from that day forward,
[1:53:31] he saw everything different.
[1:53:36] &gt;&gt; That which was darkness to him became
[1:53:38] light. That which was confusing to him
[1:53:40] became settled. Those who were enemies
[1:53:42] to him became his beloved friends
[1:53:49] &gt;&gt; because of the light.
[1:54:12] I want to go to slide three, please.
[1:54:18] We remember this word.
[1:54:21] Just stay real reverent if you would
[1:54:23] please.
[1:54:25] Brother Brandham, I'm ask people not to
[1:54:27] move. And I'm going to ask you not to
[1:54:28] get up and get out when I start to close
[1:54:31] the service because that's the most
[1:54:32] critical time. Brother Bram says we're
[1:54:34] all human spirits. Don't move like that
[1:54:38] because it affects the atmosphere
[1:54:41] because you have a human spirit and it
[1:54:43] disturbs
[1:54:45] unless it's an absolute emergency.
[1:54:49] I'd ask you in our services, not today,
[1:54:51] in the future as well.
[1:54:54] When the preacher finishes his sermon,
[1:54:56] the service is not over.
[1:54:59] Don't get up
[1:55:01] and trapes off to the bathroom or
[1:55:03] someplace.
[1:55:06] Just wait
[1:55:07] and let God's presence
[1:55:11] conclude what he's wanting to do.
[1:55:23] &gt;&gt; Who was manifested? because the prophet
[1:55:26] told us and instructed us very clearly.
[1:55:30] Please
[1:55:32] watch us closely. Please, I hope that
[1:55:34] you're getting this.
[1:55:38] All these words laid here. I can't go
[1:55:40] through them. It would take us a
[1:55:42] lifetime. But there were words God
[1:55:45] spirit came upon men and they spoke. And
[1:55:48] I spoke through Jeremiah and Isaiah and
[1:55:51] Daniel and the prophets and then through
[1:55:53] the apostles and the record of Christ.
[1:55:56] And was laid laid in in the word is
[1:56:00] seeds for a certain season.
[1:56:03] And that season for that fulfillment
[1:56:06] that season for that word I will say to
[1:56:09] become manifest. And now even when it
[1:56:12] become manifest the word I will go
[1:56:14] through it with you perhaps a little bit
[1:56:15] in the in the future but to be
[1:56:17] manifested as I gave it to you last
[1:56:20] Sunday but I want to just review it with
[1:56:22] you now to when a word is manifested in
[1:56:25] other words when this seed is to be made
[1:56:27] known that word manifested is is to be
[1:56:32] openly known. Not just opened but to be
[1:56:36] made known.
[1:56:38] I want to stop there because the word,
[1:56:42] look how the word was manifested in
[1:56:44] Christ. It was open. Jesus said to the
[1:56:48] people, "I spoke nothing in secret.
[1:56:51] I spoke nothing in a corner. I spoke it
[1:56:55] openly."
[1:56:57] But only a few got it because they were
[1:57:01] the ones that also were ordained to come
[1:57:04] out of the earth at that time with a
[1:57:06] seed in them. And when the sun shone on
[1:57:09] that seed and the word was manifested,
[1:57:12] manifested word comes from the he Greek
[1:57:15] word foss light
[1:57:19] &gt;&gt; made known openly
[1:57:24] and it is to appear. It is to shine.
[1:57:31] It is to
[1:57:33] give understanding to the mind
[1:57:38] knowledge not just knowledge a learning
[1:57:42] but it's a it's a revelation
[1:57:46] and that's
[1:57:48] what manifested is and now with that
[1:57:50] having said that
[1:57:52] said who was manifested
[1:57:57] and without controversy great is the
[1:57:59] mystery of godliness.
[1:58:01] God
[1:58:05] God was manifested.
[1:58:07] Wasn't just a man, but God was
[1:58:10] manifested.
[1:58:13] Made manifest in the flesh.
[1:58:16] What was manifested
[1:58:18] for the life was manifested. This isn't
[1:58:21] something that we're isolated from, but
[1:58:24] life was manifested.
[1:58:26] and we have seen it and bear witness and
[1:58:29] show unto you that eternal life which
[1:58:32] was with the father and was manifested
[1:58:35] unto us. It appeared to us. It appeared
[1:58:37] openly.
[1:58:42] To whom was this life manifested?
[1:58:46] who verilely was fore orained before the
[1:58:50] foundation of the world, but was
[1:58:52] manifested in these last times for you.
[1:58:56] If I could if I could give it the
[1:59:00] emphasis that it needs and if the Holy
[1:59:02] Spirit would punctuate it to your heart
[1:59:05] and your soul, you'd have something
[1:59:07] throbbing within. I need to stand and
[1:59:09] give glory to God. This whole thing, God
[1:59:12] was manifested. Amen.
[1:59:15] &gt;&gt; He was manifested in these last times
[1:59:17] for you.
[1:59:18] &gt;&gt; For me,
[1:59:19] &gt;&gt; for me. You need to say it. He was
[1:59:21] manifested. This whole thing, this word,
[1:59:24] Luke 17:30, laid laid away in history
[1:59:28] for me because it wasn't manifested
[1:59:32] until this time. Malachi 45 and 6. Laid
[1:59:36] in history for these hundreds of years,
[1:59:38] these centuries, and it laid there for
[1:59:40] me.
[1:59:45] You want a real one to swallow?
[1:59:47] &gt;&gt; William Brandon laid in the earth
[1:59:50] &gt;&gt; all these centuries of time for you.
[1:59:54] &gt;&gt; And God would bring him at the same time
[1:59:56] he would bring you
[1:59:58] &gt;&gt; because he knew that he was going to
[1:59:59] obey the voice and speak and he knew
[2:00:03] that you would hear it and receive it.
[2:00:09] &gt;&gt; It was for you. That's what the apostle
[2:00:12] said. It was manifested for you. Can you
[2:00:14] say that? Can you believe it? It was
[2:00:16] manifested for me.
[2:00:32] to whom it was manifested.
[2:00:37] Why
[2:00:41] was it manifested?
[2:00:44] What's the purpose?
[2:00:46] To take away our sins.
[2:00:51] &gt;&gt; You got a problem.
[2:00:58] You feel clouded by guilt or sin.
[2:01:02] Say, "I can't get victory over this
[2:01:04] thing."
[2:01:05] Let me give you a grand announcement.
[2:01:08] &gt;&gt; Either it's true or this whole Bible is
[2:01:11] a lie. And we're wasting our time.
[2:01:14] &gt;&gt; These scriptures were manifested. God
[2:01:17] raised up a prophet. God sent a message.
[2:01:20] Tapes were made. A sound went out. And
[2:01:23] this whole age he introduced. Why don't
[2:01:25] others have it? I don't know. That's
[2:01:27] God's business. That's another part of
[2:01:29] the earth.
[2:01:30] &gt;&gt; People say, "Well, why? They haven't
[2:01:32] heard anything about it. I've talked to
[2:01:33] people. They haven't heard anything
[2:01:35] about it." That's not my business.
[2:01:36] That's God's business.
[2:01:38] &gt;&gt; But then I see people and he does gather
[2:01:40] them. So strange.
[2:01:42] from South Africa, from Europe, from the
[2:01:45] colonies of Canada, from from South of
[2:01:50] the border, from South America,
[2:01:52] from Central America, from all over the
[2:01:55] earth, from up in the Arctic. How does
[2:01:58] this thing happen?
[2:02:00] &gt;&gt; That's God's business.
[2:02:03] &gt;&gt; He shines on that part of the earth he
[2:02:06] chooses to shine on.
[2:02:09] &gt;&gt; You could ask the same question. say,
[2:02:11] "Why aren't these roses of Sharon
[2:02:13] blooming in the Arctic?"
[2:02:15] &gt;&gt; That's God's business.
[2:02:17] &gt;&gt; He brings whatever he wants to bring
[2:02:19] when he wants to bring it.
[2:02:26] &gt;&gt; I saw some of our flowers. Oh, they look
[2:02:29] sad.
[2:02:33] So, I went to my wife and I She knows a
[2:02:35] few things about flowers. I know nothing
[2:02:38] about flowers.
[2:02:40] I says, "Our flowers are dying
[2:02:43] and we got to get out and water them.
[2:02:45] They're dying.
[2:02:47] We paid good money for these flowers.
[2:02:50] Brother Vio planted them with along with
[2:02:52] the the brothers and they're dying. They
[2:02:55] look so decrepit and made me feel bad."
[2:02:58] No, she said, "Dear,
[2:03:01] this is the fall and they just die now."
[2:03:05] Oh, okay. I felt better.
[2:03:10] I felt I had really been failing
[2:03:11] somebody. My flowers are dying because
[2:03:14] I'm not I don't say neither one of these
[2:03:16] are green.
[2:03:25] All of this word,
[2:03:28] this promise laid here
[2:03:31] for you in your season. And if you could
[2:03:34] grasp that and the purpose is to take
[2:03:36] away sin, you've got a cloud, you've got
[2:03:40] a doubt. You might say, "Well, you know,
[2:03:42] I don't like you to point." Well, I have
[2:03:44] them from time to time. I have them on a
[2:03:46] regular fairly regular basis, and I have
[2:03:50] to take confidence and retreat back to
[2:03:53] the word. Say, "I'm I'm sorry that that
[2:03:56] happened. I'm sorry I said that. I'm
[2:03:58] sorry I did that. Oh, God. Oh, God." But
[2:04:02] he was manifested. This word was
[2:04:04] manifested to take away my sin. Your
[2:04:07] sin.
[2:04:09] &gt;&gt; That's the purpose of it. And God's
[2:04:11] purpose shall not fail.
[2:04:14] &gt;&gt; Do you hear me?
[2:04:19] &gt;&gt; Somebody's going to go out of here today
[2:04:21] rejoicing.
[2:04:22] &gt;&gt; They're going to believe it. They're
[2:04:24] going to receive it.
[2:04:25] &gt;&gt; I'm telling you to in the name of the
[2:04:26] Lord, there's a man here that can turn
[2:04:29] on the light.
[2:04:35] That man when he was here, he was 12
[2:04:38] year old once.
[2:04:41] He was your age, Michael.
[2:04:44] He was your age, Michelle.
[2:04:48] Your age,
[2:04:51] Brother Nathan. Your age, Brother Sean.
[2:04:56] Never reached my age.
[2:04:59] You might say, "Well, I'm older than
[2:05:01] 33 when he died. But this man was
[2:05:05] eternal.
[2:05:07] He knows exactly
[2:05:09] what we experience.
[2:05:12] And the prophet said
[2:05:16] can be another few minutes.
[2:05:19] The prophet said that the one church age
[2:05:23] they wouldn't bow and they wouldn't
[2:05:25] bend.
[2:05:27] And the law was such that you either you
[2:05:30] either bent or you were broken.
[2:05:33] &gt;&gt; That was the great burden of that age.
[2:05:36] But he says the great and he calls it
[2:05:37] the great burden of this age
[2:05:42] is the pressure of riches.
[2:05:46] &gt;&gt; We happen to live
[2:05:49] in a rich part of the world.
[2:05:51] America with probably the highest
[2:05:54] standard of living.
[2:05:56] Might have been Sweden or one of those,
[2:05:58] but how they judge things.
[2:06:01] This part of the world is a prosperous
[2:06:03] part of the world.
[2:06:06] And he didn't say that the pressure of
[2:06:09] this age, the great the great pressure
[2:06:12] of this age, he didn't say would be
[2:06:13] riches.
[2:06:15] Said it would be the pressure of riches.
[2:06:18] The pressure it brings.
[2:06:22] And then he said he went on and
[2:06:24] interpreted that said soft living.
[2:06:29] He didn't condemn us because there were
[2:06:31] soft living. He said that's a pressure
[2:06:34] that you got to deal with.
[2:06:38] It's easier to sit in the easy chair
[2:06:41] than it is to be about maybe doing
[2:06:44] something for God.
[2:06:50] you precious people.
[2:06:53] And God alone knows how I've groaned
[2:06:56] over the border situation.
[2:07:00] But I'll say if that's the greatest
[2:07:02] pressure you have, if that's the
[2:07:04] greatest agony you have,
[2:07:10] God will bless you more exceedingly than
[2:07:14] those who did not have to experience
[2:07:16] that. And I say that with sincerity. I
[2:07:20] say it in humility.
[2:07:23] We we bear certain things. You wouldn't
[2:07:25] want to bear my burdens.
[2:07:28] You wouldn't want to bear my pressures
[2:07:34] because I have money. I I have many. I
[2:07:36] cannot go to anyone. I don't go to my
[2:07:38] wife. I don't have another minister. I
[2:07:41] don't have any. I have one.
[2:07:47] He's the the man
[2:07:50] &gt;&gt; that can turn on the light.
[2:07:53] &gt;&gt; And if I didn't have him to turn on the
[2:07:55] light,
[2:07:56] I can tell you friends,
[2:07:59] he's a very, very dear friend in time of
[2:08:03] need.
[2:08:06] I'm going to close with this.
[2:08:12] This light
[2:08:14] God help me to say this the way I need
[2:08:16] to say it.
[2:08:26] There was people who came
[2:08:30] in front of the prophet
[2:08:34] and I read several instances of it. It
[2:08:36] would do you good to read it.
[2:08:39] I personally you're I'm your brother.
[2:08:40] I'm just speaking to you like I'm at
[2:08:42] home and we're in our front room. We're
[2:08:45] speaking together. And I like I'd like
[2:08:48] to just tell you as my friends and part
[2:08:50] of our family,
[2:08:54] I looked into those eyes
[2:08:57] when he said, "You have three questions
[2:09:00] you want to ask me."
[2:09:03] And the first one is on baptism. Even as
[2:09:07] soon as he said that, you'll have to
[2:09:09] understand
[2:09:11] As soon as he said, "You have three
[2:09:12] questions." I was just looking somewhere
[2:09:14] else. Said, "I was on the on this
[2:09:17] mountain." He pointed I believe we were
[2:09:18] on this mountain here and I was riding
[2:09:21] along behind Bud and the sun was shining
[2:09:24] nice and warm.
[2:09:27] And he says he came to me there. Oh, I
[2:09:29] knew that phrase.
[2:09:32] I was so struck with it when he'd be on
[2:09:34] the he'd be on the platform and be in
[2:09:36] the meeting and he'd say, "He's here.
[2:09:40] They said he came to me there
[2:09:43] and I believe you have three questions
[2:09:44] at that moment. I I looked right into
[2:09:47] his eyes from about that far.
[2:09:54] I thought instantly
[2:09:58] of the scripture in Daniel instantly
[2:10:00] just flashed through my mind where it
[2:10:03] says that his eyes were like candles.
[2:10:07] And I thought that candle not in weak
[2:10:10] power but in intense I thought that
[2:10:13] scriptures eyes are like candles
[2:10:17] with such intensity and I was stripped
[2:10:20] naked.
[2:10:22] He said you have three questions. I
[2:10:25] understand exactly what the woman at the
[2:10:26] well said. Come see a man that told me
[2:10:29] all that ever I did.
[2:10:32] &gt;&gt; Is not this the Messiah? Now you have to
[2:10:35] hear you have to divide between
[2:10:37] what God raised up as a prophet
[2:10:40] messenger. But who was in him?
[2:10:43] &gt;&gt; Was Christ revealing himself.
[2:10:46] &gt;&gt; It wasn't William Brandham who knew I
[2:10:48] had three questions. It was the God that
[2:10:49] was in him.
[2:10:52] &gt;&gt; And you need to keep that very straight.
[2:10:54] &gt;&gt; And the God that was I was looking into.
[2:10:56] I as far as I was concerned, it wasn't
[2:10:59] some other sto fable story that came to
[2:11:01] me. It was scripture came to me
[2:11:03] instantly. I looked into those eyes. You
[2:11:06] have three questions and the first one
[2:11:08] is the baptism and the second one is the
[2:11:11] godhead and the third one is the
[2:11:13] serpent's seed
[2:11:16] and I can tell you friends
[2:11:19] in a moment of time
[2:11:22] light
[2:11:24] bathed in such a way that a thousand
[2:11:27] questions were answered. I was left with
[2:11:30] it was as though I was left with no
[2:11:32] questions
[2:11:33] and the light was so
[2:11:37] intense and I have to tell you
[2:11:40] as your brother as your friend
[2:11:43] riding along in the car how would you
[2:11:46] feel
[2:11:48] riding along in the car and I I wondered
[2:11:50] because I had these questions and I
[2:11:53] thought he doesn't believe this serpent
[2:11:55] seed this is some bad story he doesn't
[2:11:58] believe that and I'm riding along and
[2:12:00] those thoughts are going through my mind
[2:12:02] and I was waiting. I was actually
[2:12:04] waiting and I thought that he might at
[2:12:06] some point say,
[2:12:09] "You hypocrite,
[2:12:12] you know, you got all these questions.
[2:12:13] you've seen all these miracles, you
[2:12:15] know,
[2:12:16] and I thought there might be some kind
[2:12:19] of a
[2:12:21] uh
[2:12:23] you know, some stern rebuke,
[2:12:27] but it never came. And then when that
[2:12:29] light came,
[2:12:33] there was another man, and brother
[2:12:35] Brandham tells a story about him, and
[2:12:37] with this I close.
[2:12:39] And his name was Daniel Curry.
[2:12:43] and he dreamed or had a vision that he
[2:12:45] went to heaven.
[2:12:48] And when he came to heaven, he came to
[2:12:50] the the one who was at the portals
[2:12:55] and he said, "I'm Daniel Curry.
[2:13:00] I brought a thousand souls to Christ."
[2:13:05] And
[2:13:07] will you find my name, please, in the
[2:13:09] book?
[2:13:13] And the porter looked said, "I can't
[2:13:15] find your name in the book." Oh, you
[2:13:17] must be mistaken.
[2:13:20] It has to be in the book. I'm a servant
[2:13:22] of Christ. I'm a minister. I'm a
[2:13:24] preacher. And I brought a thousand souls
[2:13:27] to Christ.
[2:13:32] No sir,
[2:13:34] I can't find your name in the book.
[2:13:38] And then in that presence
[2:13:41] he heard a voice.
[2:13:46] Have you ever lied?
[2:13:49] He thought, "Well,
[2:13:53] no. I've been a truthful person, but in
[2:13:56] that presence, in that light,
[2:13:59] yeah, I guess I have.
[2:14:02] I have lied."
[2:14:05] Have you ever taken anything that wasn't
[2:14:07] yours?
[2:14:09] Well, I' I've I've been honest. I've
[2:14:12] tried to be honest. But in that
[2:14:14] presence,
[2:14:16] he saw things differently.
[2:14:19] In that light,
[2:14:23] I guess I have I guess I have taken
[2:14:26] things that weren't mine. And he saw
[2:14:29] himself being rejected.
[2:14:33] everything he had preached and
[2:14:34] everything he'd lived for and everything
[2:14:36] he had struggled for was being lost.
[2:14:42] Said he heard a voice, another voice.
[2:14:47] He said that voice was sweeter than any
[2:14:49] mother's voice.
[2:14:52] said, "Father,
[2:14:55] yes,
[2:14:57] Daniel Curry has done these things,
[2:15:02] but on earth
[2:15:04] he stood for me
[2:15:07] and now I stand for him."
[2:15:12] Why was this word manifested
[2:15:16] to take away your sin?
[2:15:19] Why was this man that can turn on the
[2:15:22] light? Why was these scriptures
[2:15:24] manifested? Why is Luke 17:30? I intend
[2:15:28] to emphasize it so you can never forget
[2:15:30] it. Why was it manifested through a
[2:15:33] prophet in your day?
[2:15:36] &gt;&gt; He said, "And again, it was manifested
[2:15:38] to destroy the works of the devil."
[2:15:46] Don't sit here and go out from here and
[2:15:50] give opportunity to the devil. Announce
[2:15:54] this to him. There's been a word that's
[2:15:57] been manifested. It has come to light in
[2:16:00] my day.
[2:16:03] &gt;&gt; God brought me up out of the earth to
[2:16:05] hear this thing. To hear it and to say
[2:16:08] it and to come under this kind of
[2:16:10] ministry. I've heard the voice and it's
[2:16:12] been manifested to destroy the works of
[2:16:16] the devil
[2:16:17] &gt;&gt; and the people of God. Can you say amen?
[2:16:21] &gt;&gt; I'm not just preaching a sermon,
[2:16:22] friends. I'm preaching my heart and soul
[2:16:24] to you. This is a reality.
[2:16:27] &gt;&gt; This word was this word was manifested.
[2:16:31] &gt;&gt; It came to light in this time.
[2:16:36] How could this messenger stand for year
[2:16:39] after year and service after service?
[2:16:41] And even as you read the titles and he's
[2:16:43] gone from this and he drives over here
[2:16:45] and he's he's just going one service
[2:16:47] after another taking this little frail
[2:16:50] body of clay and wearing it down to
[2:16:53] nothing to bring announcement to you. He
[2:16:57] of whom I speak is now present.
[2:17:01] There is a man here that can turn on the
[2:17:04] light.
[2:17:05] &gt;&gt; Who is this Melkazedc? He's here.
[2:17:08] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. He's present. He's here now.
[2:17:12] &gt;&gt; And that God that brought him brought
[2:17:14] you.
[2:17:16] &gt;&gt; That God that brought him caused you to
[2:17:18] come at this season to hear these
[2:17:20] things.
[2:17:24] I deny Satan any opportunity in the name
[2:17:27] of Jesus Christ who's manifested himself
[2:17:29] in this hour to haunt you and to cloud
[2:17:32] your life and to confuse you.
[2:17:44] &gt;&gt; We're human.
[2:17:50] We have feelings.
[2:17:53] We have attitudes.
[2:17:56] Our feelings get hurt.
[2:17:58] We get misunderstood.
[2:18:05] Life has its disappointments. Doesn't
[2:18:07] unfold the way we would like it to.
[2:18:10] Sometime
[2:18:14] I know you all have it. We all
[2:18:18] experience it. We have disappointments.
[2:18:21] This isn't what I expected.
[2:18:25] Then we have we're in a large
[2:18:26] congregation of people here.
[2:18:31] Sometimes feelings arise within a family
[2:18:34] within the extended family within the
[2:18:36] in-laws.
[2:18:41] It can extend within the family of God
[2:18:43] which is here as brothers and sisters.
[2:18:48] And I was very very affected in the last
[2:18:51] two or three days when I thought of
[2:18:53] Daniel Curry
[2:18:56] and I thought of my own life and I was
[2:18:58] examining myself and I thought, "Oh God,
[2:19:04] let that light shine on me."
[2:19:08] And if I have any ill,
[2:19:10] if I have any feeling that's contrary,
[2:19:15] maybe if I thought and you just came and
[2:19:18] said, "Brother Ed, how do you feel
[2:19:19] towards every I think I think they're
[2:19:21] wonderful.
[2:19:23] Is there anybody that you have any
[2:19:24] misunderstanding with? Is there anybody
[2:19:26] that kind of grates against you? Is
[2:19:27] there is there some that are, you know,
[2:19:30] you have more friendship with than
[2:19:31] others? Are there
[2:19:34] Well,
[2:19:36] do you love them?" And we use this word.
[2:19:38] Oh, I love them. I love them. Be very
[2:19:41] careful with that word
[2:19:43] because someday
[2:19:46] I said Daniel Curry, not Daniel Curry
[2:19:49] now, Ed Biscll.
[2:19:51] Do you love this man?
[2:19:55] Well, yes. Yes, I do. Uh,
[2:19:58] you're sure?
[2:20:02] Well, now when you put it that way and
[2:20:04] when you put it in this presence,
[2:20:07] I guess I have failed.
[2:20:11] Shine on me.
[2:20:13] Let that light shine on me.
[2:20:16] &gt;&gt; Let that light dispel
[2:20:20] anything that's contrary.
[2:20:23] &gt;&gt; Let that light just cause it to
[2:20:26] evaporate.
[2:20:28] Like when you said to me, well, see, it
[2:20:31] wasn't brother Brandham said to me. It
[2:20:33] was that light that said, you have three
[2:20:35] questions. We have questions in life.
[2:20:41] But dear friends, my friends, my family,
[2:20:47] there's a man here
[2:20:50] that can turn on the light.
[2:20:53] &gt;&gt; And I pray that that light will come in
[2:20:55] such a way
[2:20:57] that maybe things that
[2:21:00] you've held,
[2:21:03] things that you thought, man, it's okay.
[2:21:09] But let that light come. I pray that
[2:21:11] light, I ask, oh God, I've prayed
[2:21:14] sincerely
[2:21:16] that that light may come upon each
[2:21:19] member of this congregation.
[2:21:21] and things you thought were maybe okay
[2:21:24] in that light, they're not okay.
[2:21:27] Say, "God, shine on me." And I'll just
[2:21:31] move into position.
[2:21:33] I'll just move into position. Say, "How,
[2:21:35] Brother Ed?" Just by yielding.
[2:21:38] By yielding. If he speaks to you, say,
[2:21:40] "I'll do it. I'll do it. And I'll be
[2:21:44] quick and I'll do it." Shall we pray?
[2:21:53] Dear father,
[2:21:56] you are light.
[2:21:59] Oh, we don't have an understanding of
[2:22:01] light the way you speak of it. And I've
[2:22:05] been pondering this for many days now.
[2:22:08] There's something so lovely and so
[2:22:10] glorious about that light.
[2:22:14] There's something so marvelous about
[2:22:17] life and how you bring it.
[2:22:20] And Father,
[2:22:24] we've experienced perhaps some eruptions
[2:22:27] in our lives.
[2:22:30] But after it's over,
[2:22:33] you bring again life and you bathe us
[2:22:36] with the warmth of your son.
[2:22:39] Oh Lord Jesus,
[2:22:42] son of man that has shone in our time,
[2:22:47] don't leave us, Lord
[2:22:50] the dismal, dismal parts of the world.
[2:22:53] Don't leave us, don't leave us subjected
[2:22:56] to the cold winds of this world.
[2:23:00] Don't let us to be affected oh God by
[2:23:02] what we have to deal with day after day
[2:23:05] in the world in the halls of learning in
[2:23:08] the schools in the world of business
[2:23:11] in the world of commerce
[2:23:13] in just a daily life oh God protect us I
[2:23:17] pray and keep us on the back side of the
[2:23:20] desert where you can speak to us Lord I
[2:23:24] pray you'll bless this people with your
[2:23:25] presence
[2:23:27] Jesus we love you
[2:23:30] and we thank you and we trust you for
[2:23:33] the rest of the service and what you
[2:23:34] would do
[2:23:36] in Jesus name.
[2:23:42] You can just look this way and I trust
[2:23:44] you'll just keep in this atmosphere.
[2:23:47] This is very very different for me.
[2:23:52] But some lives, our lives, and some
[2:23:55] point in our lives.
[2:24:00] I wonder if you just put this slide up.
[2:24:05] Give me the ability to handle my slides
[2:24:07] again, please.
[2:24:13] If we can take down the lights, please.
[2:24:26] This is Mount St. Helens.
[2:24:31] Stood there in God's beauty of creation.
[2:24:35] There it is again.
[2:24:45] There it is again.
[2:24:48] The Milk Ravar was flying in an airplane
[2:24:51] directly over this when this happened.
[2:24:58] There it is again.
[2:25:01] An incredible eruption
[2:25:05] cleaved off 1,300
[2:25:08] ft in elevation off the top of the
[2:25:11] mountain.
[2:25:12] 1,300
[2:25:14] ft. The whole cone of the mountain.
[2:25:18] ascended into the atmosphere in ash,
[2:25:22] broken almost into nothing.
[2:25:26] The eruption of May the 18th,
[2:25:30] 1980 sent volcanic ash and steam and
[2:25:33] water and debris to a height of 60,000
[2:25:37] ft.
[2:25:38] The mountain lost
[2:25:41] uh 1300 ft of its altitude.
[2:25:44] For more than nine hours, a vigorous
[2:25:47] plume of ash erupted, eventually
[2:25:49] reaching 12 to 15 miles, 20 to 25
[2:25:53] kilometers above the sea level. And the
[2:25:56] plume moved eastward at an average speed
[2:25:58] of 60 mph
[2:26:00] with ash reaching Idaho by noon.
[2:26:04] May 19th, the devastating devastating
[2:26:08] eruption was over.
[2:26:13] There was a man, this man here.
[2:26:17] You see him sitting there and he refused
[2:26:20] to looks like he's making some notes.
[2:26:24] I'm sorry.
[2:26:27] I want to go back here.
[2:26:43] David Johnson of Cold Water,
[2:26:47] Illinois, I guess it is, at 1900 hours.
[2:26:51] David did not survive the next day's
[2:26:53] eruption.
[2:26:57] Uh
[2:26:58] he said this Cold Water 2, I'm sorry, at
[2:27:01] a certain place, Cold Water 2 would
[2:27:03] eventually be renamed Johnson Ridge in
[2:27:05] honor of Dave. This photograph was taken
[2:27:08] May the 19th. They said that this
[2:27:11] eruption was so great and this is not
[2:27:14] this is not out of keeping with my
[2:27:16] message.
[2:27:22] There's a lot of lives here and I want
[2:27:25] to speak honestly even if this was my
[2:27:27] last service.
[2:27:29] If Satan could he would have destroyed
[2:27:32] you long ago.
[2:27:34] Some eruption takes place in our lives.
[2:27:38] incredible upheaval and eruption.
[2:27:42] And I have dealt with a lot of people at
[2:27:45] times like this and they wonder is this
[2:27:47] the judgment of God or is this some
[2:27:50] thing that God I let you know that this
[2:27:53] this God this one this one that is a man
[2:27:56] here that can turn on the light also
[2:27:59] this ministry came at this time to set
[2:28:02] warning
[2:28:03] before judgment.
[2:28:05] &gt;&gt; Amen. This same ministry said, "I indict
[2:28:08] this generation."
[2:28:10] Listen to me, my precious friends. This
[2:28:13] world that we get so attached to is
[2:28:16] under the indictment of Almighty God.
[2:28:21] &gt;&gt; It's under the judgment word of Almighty
[2:28:23] God. And I declare to you, it also shall
[2:28:26] be manifested. Amen.
[2:28:30] &gt;&gt; The eyes of the believer, I trust, shall
[2:28:34] never see it. Only with our eyes will we
[2:28:37] see the destruction.
[2:28:41] I trust we are in another realm, in
[2:28:43] another place. And I can tell you that a
[2:28:46] believer cannot be destroyed by the
[2:28:48] judgment of God. We were saved from the
[2:28:51] judgment of God. This is what Calvary is
[2:28:54] all about. He was judged for us.
[2:29:00] And they said
[2:29:03] it'll be years
[2:29:06] or how many years this is such a
[2:29:08] devastation.
[2:29:10] Animals were killed, the vegetation, the
[2:29:13] trees, the forest, everything's gone.
[2:29:16] And they wondered if it would be how
[2:29:19] long it would take.
[2:29:22] The cone is gone.
[2:29:26] And there
[2:29:28] comes plant life,
[2:29:31] flowers
[2:29:33] blooming out of that terrible
[2:29:35] destruction.
[2:29:37] In just very little time, this fireweed
[2:29:41] is one species of plant life which has
[2:29:44] returned to Mount St. Helen's devastated
[2:29:46] area. Vegetation began appearing as
[2:29:49] early as the summer of 1980. As many
[2:29:52] small trees and plants were protected by
[2:29:55] the snowpack on May the 18th. Seeds
[2:29:59] carried by the wind or by animals also
[2:30:03] entered into the area and grew. And by
[2:30:05] 1985, the ridges and surrounding of the
[2:30:09] volcano were covered with new growth.
[2:30:13] Oh, I can tell you friends
[2:30:16] this is this is something you can give
[2:30:18] us the lights now please and shut this
[2:30:20] off.
[2:30:22] I felt directed strangely directed
[2:30:27] to show these pictures
[2:30:30] because after a service like this Satan
[2:30:33] would indeed like to
[2:30:36] cause some to think that you're beyond
[2:30:39] the reach. If you're beyond, let me say
[2:30:42] this in the name of the Lord. This light
[2:30:44] that I'm speaking of, there is not one
[2:30:47] single question or problem or dilemma
[2:30:50] that is here in this building. And I
[2:30:52] would encourage you, in fact, is I would
[2:30:55] counsel you, do not give any credit to
[2:30:58] the devil.
[2:30:59] &gt;&gt; Don't ever say for a moment, I can't or
[2:31:02] somehow he can't or somehow I've prayed.
[2:31:05] I tell you, there's a man here that can
[2:31:07] turn on the light. There's a man here
[2:31:09] that can break that chain. There's a man
[2:31:12] here that can change your desires
[2:31:16] &gt;&gt; and change the whole atmosphere of your
[2:31:18] life.
[2:31:20] &gt;&gt; Let's stand.
[2:31:34] Just want to pray once again.
[2:31:38] Our dear father,
[2:31:40] loving heavenly father,
[2:31:45] you who have brought us here, we did not
[2:31:48] ask to come.
[2:31:51] We did not ask to be born in this season
[2:31:53] at this time,
[2:31:55] but you ordained it so.
[2:31:59] We're here to serve you. We're here to
[2:32:03] show in a real in a real way that we
[2:32:06] have love for you. And Lord,
[2:32:10] in that light, in the brilliance of that
[2:32:13] light, and in the light of even the
[2:32:15] message this morning, in my frailty and
[2:32:19] in the perhaps inability, but yet you
[2:32:22] can take the words, and I pray that you
[2:32:24] will, Lord, don't let the service just
[2:32:27] end and people go their way.
[2:32:30] But let these let these thoughts from
[2:32:33] the Almighty God
[2:32:36] sink very deep into the control room of
[2:32:38] the soul.
[2:32:40] And may there be faith inspired to
[2:32:43] believe.
[2:32:45] I pray that Satan will be defeated on
[2:32:48] every front and that your church may
[2:32:52] advance as a great marching army. I
[2:32:56] thank you for the marvelous unity that
[2:32:59] you have given amongst the bride of
[2:33:01] Jesus Christ. Others may see other
[2:33:05] things. They may see the backward part,
[2:33:08] but I see the glorious face of the Lord
[2:33:11] Jesus Christ shining in the revealed
[2:33:14] word manifesting itself. I see lives
[2:33:18] being changed. I see souls and natures
[2:33:21] being transformed. I see your glorious
[2:33:25] work and I'm here today to give you all
[2:33:27] the praise and all the glory.
[2:33:31] Oh God, bless these your children.
[2:33:34] They're your children
[2:33:36] through your children.
[2:33:39] And on that day,
[2:33:42] on that day, because we have received
[2:33:44] you now, Lord, and there may be some
[2:33:45] here that have not made that separation
[2:33:48] from the world and you have dealt with
[2:33:51] them. You're speaking to them even now
[2:33:53] by the Holy Spirit.
[2:33:56] And you're wanting and causing them to
[2:33:58] yield. You're desiring, oh God, to woo
[2:34:01] them and to bring them and to call them
[2:34:04] from the field of sin, to call them from
[2:34:08] the hog pan where the prodal son was.
[2:34:12] May there be an awakening and may they
[2:34:14] run over the hills to meet a waiting
[2:34:17] father. Lord, even now, let there be a
[2:34:20] yieldedness, a yielding, a yielding,
[2:34:23] Lord Jesus, let them say, I come. I come
[2:34:27] out of my bondage and out of my sin and
[2:34:30] out of my sorrow. I come, Lord Jesus, I
[2:34:34] come.
[2:34:36] Father, let it be. I pray that you will
[2:34:40] grant me the reward of this service
[2:34:43] and seeing some soul come to you. I so
[2:34:47] desire just another soul to come. And oh
[2:34:51] God, I pray you'll forgive us. Forgive
[2:34:53] us our wrongdoings.
[2:34:56] Forgive us our sin.
[2:34:58] Forgive us, oh God,
[2:35:00] those times when we have failed you. And
[2:35:04] we even you sent a twinge of the Holy
[2:35:06] Spirit within and we we didn't listen.
[2:35:09] We didn't heed it. Oh God, wash us. Wash
[2:35:13] us and we'll be whiter than snow.
[2:35:16] Granted, oh God, I pray the name of
[2:35:20] Jesus Christ.
[2:35:25] We thank you, Lord.
[2:35:28] We have shine on me, please.
[2:35:35] Shine
[2:35:37] on me,
[2:35:40] Lord. Shine
[2:35:43] on me.
[2:35:46] Let the light
[2:35:48] from the lighthouse
[2:35:52] shine
[2:35:54] on me.
[2:35:57] Shine
[2:35:59] on me. It's my prayer. Lord, oh shine
[2:36:05] on me.
[2:36:07] Let the light
[2:36:10] [Music]
[2:36:13] shine.
[2:36:17] as a prayer. Make it a prayer. Shine.
[2:36:21] &gt;&gt; Oh, shine on me. Shine on me.
[2:36:26] [Music]
[2:36:29] &gt;&gt; Let the light
[2:36:33] [Music]
[2:36:35] shine
[2:36:37] on me.
[2:36:39] [Music]
[2:36:50] Let the light
[2:36:53] from the light
[2:36:56] shine.
[2:37:04] Whiter
[2:37:05] than snow.
[2:37:08] Yes. Whiter
[2:37:11] snow.
[2:37:14] Thou wash me
[2:37:17] and I
[2:37:19] shall be wer.
[2:37:22] Is that your desire with all your heart?
[2:37:26] Whiter.
[2:37:27] [Music]
[2:37:29] &gt;&gt; Oh, credit.
[2:37:32] [Music]
[2:37:36] Now wash me
[2:37:38] and I
[2:37:40] tell me why.
[2:37:43] [Music]
[2:37:46] &gt;&gt; You know the song we've sung it many
[2:37:49] times.
[2:37:52] I pray, oh God,
[2:37:54] let that light may it be that very light
[2:37:57] that Daniel Curry came into, the light
[2:38:00] that the Apostle Paul came into,
[2:38:04] not something you've experienced many
[2:38:06] years ago, but may it be fresh today.
[2:38:09] Oh, may that illuminating light, may the
[2:38:11] warmth of that sun
[2:38:14] shine on this entire congregation.
[2:38:19] May it bring forth new life, new vigor,
[2:38:21] new enthusiasm,
[2:38:23] &gt;&gt; new love, new commitment, new
[2:38:26] dedication.
[2:38:28] &gt;&gt; Could we do that?
[2:38:30] &gt;&gt; How many want to dedicate themselves
[2:38:32] aresh? How many want to be whiter than
[2:38:34] snow?
[2:38:36] How many want to be in full harmony with
[2:38:38] the Holy Spirit? How many here need to
[2:38:41] be filled with the Holy Ghost? How many
[2:38:43] need to be refilled with the Holy Ghost?
[2:38:45] Raise your hands to him.
[2:38:51] [Music]
[2:38:53] Whiter
[2:38:55] snow.
[2:38:57] Oh, whiter

[2:39:15] than snow.
[2:39:17] Yes. I want to be in harmony with you,
[2:39:20] Lord. I want to be in harmony with your
[2:39:22] people, oh God. Now watch me
[2:39:25] and I
[2:39:27] tell me why
[2:39:31] no.
[2:39:33] Feel
[2:39:35] me now.

[2:40:52] who's filled with God.
[2:40:55] We have every right and every
[2:40:58] possibility.
[2:41:00] God has equipped us. How many believe
[2:41:02] that God has equipped us with everything
[2:41:05] that we need
[2:41:07] &gt;&gt; for this generation? He raised you up
[2:41:09] for this generation to manifest his
[2:41:12] power and his glory and his victory in
[2:41:17] this hour. What a privilege we have.
[2:41:22] &gt;&gt; What an honor.
[2:41:25] &gt;&gt; Oh, bless the Lord, oh my soul.
[2:41:37] Call upon Jesus to come and fill me now.
[2:41:42] Sing it again. Oh fill
[2:41:47] me now. Not tomorrow. Just now. Fill me.
[2:41:51] Fill me now. Right now. Jesus

[2:43:40] &gt;&gt; I don't know if you're anxious to go,
[2:43:42] but I'm not. I'm anxious to worship him.
[2:43:45] I'm anxious to tell him how wonderful.
[2:43:47] I'm anxious to invite him.
[2:43:53] &gt;&gt; I just urge you to come into this place.
[2:43:56] He's not far, friends. He's here. He's
[2:43:59] here. He's here. He's waiting to make
[2:44:01] himself
[2:44:02] &gt;&gt; real and more real and more known, more
[2:44:05] dear to you.
[2:44:08] [Music]

[2:44:47] I come
[2:44:52] just as I am with a glee. just as I am.
[2:44:57] &gt;&gt; Yes, Lord.
[2:45:05] [Music]
[2:45:10] &gt;&gt; There is a time,
[2:45:12] &gt;&gt; sometimes there's a time in God's
[2:45:14] economy when that life needs to come
[2:45:17] forth and break forth from out from
[2:45:19] under that rock, under that weight,
[2:45:21] under that concrete.
[2:45:24] under that burden. There's a time for it
[2:45:26] to come.
[2:45:27] [Music]
[2:45:29] &gt;&gt; This might be your moment.
[2:45:31] [Music]
[2:45:42] &gt;&gt; You might even be here and have not
[2:45:44] surrendered your life completely. Oh,
[2:45:47] surrender it completely. You might say,
[2:45:49] "Well, I have surrendered. I think that
[2:45:51] I have but in that light
[2:45:56] [Music]
[2:45:57] &gt;&gt; in that majesty
[2:46:00] maybe it's a part of the life that
[2:46:01] hasn't been surrendered
[2:46:04] I'll invite you to surrender to him
[2:46:08] even if you wish to come
[2:46:13] &gt;&gt; and kneel here and separate yourself
[2:46:16] &gt;&gt; in a moment of surrender and evidence
[2:46:20] I give myself unreservedly
[2:46:25] &gt;&gt; just as
[2:46:28] I am
[2:46:33] one plea,
[2:46:36] but that
[2:46:38] thy blood
[2:46:41] was shed
[2:46:43] for me
[2:46:45] and that
[2:46:51] Come to me,
[2:46:55] oh lamb
[2:46:57] of God.
[2:46:59] I come.
[2:47:02] I
[2:47:04] come. Let's sing that verse again.
[2:47:08] Just
[2:47:11] I have
[2:47:14] [Music]
[2:47:18] glor
[2:47:23] [Music]
[2:47:33] to thee.
[2:47:35] Oh
[2:47:38] God.
[2:47:42] [Music]
[2:47:48] Let me speak to this congregation.
[2:47:53] You may not always have this kind of
[2:47:55] opportunity.
[2:47:58] This day that you're living in, that I'm
[2:48:00] living in has an incredible cooling
[2:48:05] effect
[2:48:06] upon the believer, upon the red hot
[2:48:10] believer. And this is not a negative
[2:48:12] thing. But if we just mingle with the
[2:48:15] world day after day, which we are called
[2:48:18] on to do, that we are in the world, but
[2:48:21] we're not of the world. But if we don't
[2:48:24] constantly feed, and if we don't
[2:48:26] constantly hear, and if we don't
[2:48:28] constantly fellowship,
[2:48:30] you will just cool off.
[2:48:34] &gt;&gt; And I've seen those that have cooled.
[2:48:37] Well, it's been so gradual. just so
[2:48:39] gradual.
[2:48:43] I said just the other day, where's this
[2:48:46] brother and sister? I haven't seen them.
[2:48:50] Oh,
[2:48:52] you know, financial stress. Who hasn't
[2:48:54] got financial stress?
[2:48:57] They have this kind of pressure
[2:49:00] pressure of this life
[2:49:04] and got discouraged
[2:49:08] and we're going to come periodically
[2:49:11] and finally don't come anymore.
[2:49:15] You know friends, I don't say that with
[2:49:18] a negative to that brother or that
[2:49:20] sister. If I could put my arms around
[2:49:24] them now, I would do so. But I say in
[2:49:29] this atmosphere,
[2:49:31] where are they today?
[2:49:33] Where are
[2:49:35] there's a cooling? It's a cooling
[2:49:37] effect. Don't let that happen. Whatever
[2:49:40] you do, don't let that happen.
[2:49:43] Remain fervent and take take now what
[2:49:47] you've heard.
[2:49:50] And if you can just do so, say, "Oh God,
[2:49:53] and this is what I pray. This is my
[2:49:55] really my request before God."
[2:49:59] Wherever it might be, I pray that God
[2:50:01] will bring you,
[2:50:04] every one of you, in your own private
[2:50:07] time or someplace,
[2:50:09] bring you into that glorious light. I'm
[2:50:13] talking about the light such as you've
[2:50:15] never experienced before. I'm talking
[2:50:17] about a penetrating light. It's not a
[2:50:20] condemning light, but it's a penetrating
[2:50:22] light. Things that sounded okay before,
[2:50:24] they suddenly aren't okay. Feelings that
[2:50:26] you had before suddenly aren't okay
[2:50:28] anymore. Things that we maybe would say
[2:50:31] suddenly aren't. And and attitudes and
[2:50:33] characteristics which we display,
[2:50:35] they're suddenly not right anymore. We
[2:50:37] have a certain conviction. And I say,
[2:50:39] "Oh, God, do it for us in this hour."
[2:50:43] &gt;&gt; Otherwise, I'd have to say, "We're fine.
[2:50:45] We're a-okay." But I don't believe that.
[2:50:49] I believe that God wants to do more for
[2:50:50] us. I believe that's why he sends these
[2:50:52] kind of words. That's why he sent this
[2:50:54] message.
[2:50:56] [Music]
[2:51:02] &gt;&gt; And we're just going to sing and close
[2:51:04] in just a moment. We're going to sing
[2:51:06] once more just as I am. And if you want
[2:51:08] to come and if you feel that you'd like
[2:51:11] to have prayer, that's fine. We'll be
[2:51:13] happy to pray with you.
[2:51:17] But I'd ask you to remember these words
[2:51:21] and taking and carry them home.
[2:51:24] And whether it's right or whether it's
[2:51:26] wrong,
[2:51:27] but I say to all of you as a confession.
[2:51:30] I set Brother Brandham's life before me
[2:51:32] in the last few days.
[2:51:41] And I'm very gripped.
[2:51:43] I'm very gripped with the fact that that
[2:51:46] light, that pillar of fire
[2:51:50] would come to a man.
[2:51:58] Oh God,
[2:51:59] help me to live.
[2:52:01] I'm glad you sent even that kind of an
[2:52:04] example that we could have in this day.
[2:52:06] and the forces
[2:52:09] that would come
[2:52:11] against him and the opposition. We know
[2:52:15] nothing of that. Said, "Oh God, help me
[2:52:18] to be a man. Help me to be stalward."
[2:52:22] &gt;&gt; Yes, Lord.
[2:52:22] &gt;&gt; Help me to stand. I want to stand like
[2:52:26] one of the redeemed. And he gave us such
[2:52:29] an example.
[2:52:34] It was sister Linda Ratif's father that
[2:52:36] said to me once
[2:52:39] and we were just talking bearing our
[2:52:41] hearts as two ministers.
[2:52:44] We're standing in the kitchen in his
[2:52:46] home and brother Ratif's home.
[2:52:50] And now it got way late into the night.
[2:52:52] We've just come home from some place and
[2:52:55] it was late late. It was around midnight
[2:53:00] and brother Ratif he said you know
[2:53:05] brother Brandham had many enemies
[2:53:09] but he said brother Brandham
[2:53:12] didn't have any enemies.
[2:53:16] That statement stuck with me. Brother
[2:53:19] Brandham had many enemies
[2:53:22] but brother Brham didn't have any
[2:53:24] enemies.
[2:53:26] I've craved that kind of a character
[2:53:32] &gt;&gt; that they could have many enemies.
[2:53:35] We'd have many people misunderstand us.
[2:53:39] But you and I, we're not to have any
[2:53:42] enemies.
[2:53:44] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen to that?
[2:53:47] &gt;&gt; Just as
[2:53:49] [Music]
[2:53:51] Glory
[2:53:55] [Music]
[2:54:19] of God.
[2:54:21] [Music]
[2:54:27] The last verse please. Just as I am,
[2:54:29] thou will receive.
[2:54:32] Just as
[2:54:34] I am,
[2:54:36] thou will
[2:54:38] receive.
[2:54:40] Listen, we'll welcome
[2:54:43] and pardon
[2:54:44] [Music]
[2:54:46] cleans
[2:54:48] relief
[2:54:50] because it's his promise. My promise
[2:54:55] &gt;&gt; I
[2:54:57] believe
[2:55:04] I come.
[2:55:06] [Music]
[2:55:11] Thank you my dear friends, brothers and
[2:55:13] sisters for the respect and the
[2:55:17] reverence that you've had today. Ask
[2:55:19] brother Tom if you'll close please in
[2:55:21] prayer.
[2:55:28] Precious Lord.
[2:55:32] Lord, when this light
[2:55:35] shone upon our hearts, there was a great
[2:55:38] awakening.
[2:55:40] And I'm so thankful for that awakening.
[2:55:43] For there was another group, Lord, that
[2:55:45] light shone on and darkness comprehended
[2:55:47] it not. They didn't seize a hold of it.
[2:55:51] They didn't take that light. But Lord,
[2:55:53] we're so thankful for this light that
[2:55:55] has shone so brightly in our hour. Lord,
[2:55:59] this resurrected king. We take a hold
[2:56:03] that we seize it. We love it. And we
[2:56:05] say, Lord, shine on me. Let the light of
[2:56:09] this gospel so shine on me. Lord, drive
[2:56:13] all darkness out of our lives. And only
[2:56:16] let the light shine. And Lord, let us
[2:56:19] come forth in the likeness of God. In
[2:56:22] your image is our desire. And so Lord,
[2:56:24] as we'll go our ways, let our light
[2:56:27] shine for the glory of God. And may
[2:56:30] Lord, you be pleased with our lives.
[2:56:33] Drive out the darkness that we can say,
[2:56:36] "Arise and shine. My light has come.
[2:56:40] Bless your people." We pray now in Jesus
[2:56:43] name. Amen.
[2:56:46] Amen.
[2:56:48] [Music]
[2:56:52] Wonder Brother Andes if you come,
[2:56:54] Brother Lance, if you could come and
[2:56:57] assist us with prayer.
[2:57:00] I'm just going to dismiss you quietly
[2:57:02] and reverently and ask you not to visit
[2:57:05] in the
[2:57:07] in the foyer
[2:57:09] and just obey God as God directs you to
[2:57:13] do it. In the name of Jesus Christ, I
[2:57:15] dismiss you.
[2:57:17] God bless you.
[2:57:19] Oh, how we thank you, Lord. How we love
[2:57:21] you.
