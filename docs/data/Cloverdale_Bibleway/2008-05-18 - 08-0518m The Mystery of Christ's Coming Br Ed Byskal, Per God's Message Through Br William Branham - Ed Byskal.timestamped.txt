[3:41] [Music]
[3:43] He loves me.
[3:47] I fall and saw my
[3:56] Amen. I've got I'm so glad we've got a
[3:58] God that looked past all of our faults,
[4:01] all of our failures. And I was reading
[4:04] this morning and he called us his bride.
[4:07] &gt;&gt; What a wonderful privilege we have. You
[4:10] believe that?
[4:11] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen. This morning, I'd like
[4:14] to maybe do things a little different,
[4:16] but I'd like to uh start off with He
[4:18] Knows My Name, number 979 on the screen.
[4:22] And then after we sing that, I like
[4:24] Jeremy, Lesie, and Flo and Liz to come
[4:26] up. They'll sing a song.
[4:31] I have a m
[4:37] [Music]
[4:45] and before
[4:48] I began
[4:50] my life was in his hand.
[4:58] He knows
[5:00] my name.
[5:04] He knows my every
[5:11] sing
[5:16] and hear me when I
[5:21] [Music]
[5:24] have a father.
[5:28] [Music]
[5:36] and you
[5:40] me
[5:42] no matter where I go.
[5:46] [Music]
[5:49] He know
[5:52] he knows my name.
[5:55] He knows my every
[6:01] [Music]
[6:10] single
[6:12] [Music]
[6:26] He sees
[6:29] my heart
[6:31] and hears me when I
[6:36] [Music]
[6:39] amen.
[6:41] Brother Jeremy met me this morning in
[6:43] the study and said, "We've got a song
[6:44] that we'd like to sing and if you want
[6:46] to come and listen to it." And I said,
[6:48] "Sure." So, I went into the the music
[6:51] room and and listened to it and and I I
[6:54] just felt led in my heart that this is
[6:56] something that we should maybe have
[6:58] right at the beginning of the service.
[7:00] And I know Wednesday night we had uh our
[7:03] brother Jason here preaching and uh how
[7:06] many how many had a need need met
[7:08] Wednesday night? I know I was sitting
[7:10] right where brother Ron Garrick's
[7:13] sitting and there was something specific
[7:15] on my heart and it took brother Jason
[7:17] Walkin from 2500 miles away to come and
[7:20] the Lord met my need
[7:22] &gt;&gt; and this this is this song is called by
[7:24] his word and I know many times uh a
[7:29] couple of times know brother Ed has has
[7:31] through ministry and the ministry
[7:32] ministry here when they've spoken they
[7:35] said think of something specific that
[7:36] you need and the Lord will will will
[7:38] meet And I think this song is something
[7:41] that will bring us to a place where I
[7:43] believe our our needs will be answered.
[7:45] So I want you, as our pastor said, I
[7:47] want you to think of something specific
[7:49] that you want met this morning. And I've
[7:52] I was in the study and I told Brother
[7:54] Tom when he came in, we talked about we
[7:56] kind of joke back back and forth about
[7:57] pacing. You're nervous, but I just feel
[7:59] really heavy on my heart and I was just
[8:01] pacing back and forth said, "Lord,
[8:03] whatever it is, whatever you need from
[8:05] us this morning. Meet my need. Meet our
[8:07] people's need. You know, you're worthy.
[8:09] You met me Wednesday. I believe today
[8:11] you can meet us today. So I want you,
[8:13] this is just Brother Jason. I'm just a
[8:15] nobody, you know, but I really love you
[8:17] and I appreciate you." And I just think
[8:19] just pick something in your life that
[8:20] you want him to meet and I believe he'll
[8:22] meet you. And then after that we'll
[8:24] we'll join them in the course.
[8:30] [Music]
[8:50] It is written
[8:52] that man shall not live by bread alone,
[8:58] but by every word that comes from the
[9:02] mouth of God.
[9:07] And by his word, he gave his son for us
[9:12] on Calary
[9:15] to pay the price of sin for you and for
[9:21] me.
[9:23] &gt;&gt; By his word,
[9:24] &gt;&gt; he raised the sick man from the bed.
[9:28] &gt;&gt; He gave life unto the dead. Oh, he
[9:34] brings hope to the hopeless.
[9:39] By his word
[9:41] &gt;&gt; you can have the victory
[9:44] &gt;&gt; for he has set the captive free.
[9:49] &gt;&gt; Oh he gives life to you and me.
[9:55] [Music]
[10:04] Just one word was broken in Eden and
[10:08] that's what caused the fall.
[10:12] So it would take all of the word to
[10:17] bring us back to God.
[10:20] And through this last day message,
[10:24] all his word has been made known.
[10:28] And through his power, we shall overcome
[10:36] his word. He spoke and squirrels did.

[11:00] &gt;&gt; By his word, he gives life to you and
[11:04] me.

[12:18] &gt;&gt; in his name.
[12:20] &gt;&gt; Let's sing that right from by his word.

[12:24] congregation. Just sing where you think
[12:25] you'll fit in. Let's start. He spoke to
[12:28] the scrolls and they did appear. Let's

[36:14] Would
[36:16] it be wonderful just take some time this
[36:18] morning and say, "Praise him."
[36:21] &gt;&gt; I will praise him. Isn't he lovely?
[36:24] Isn't he wonderful? Has he been good to
[36:27] you?
[36:29] &gt;&gt; So wonderful.
[36:31] Look around you. Look where you could
[36:33] have been. Look where you are.
[36:35] Hallelujah.
[36:37] Hallelujah. Where would you have been
[36:39] without this gospel? Where would you
[36:41] have been without this Christ? Oh, and
[36:44] here we have the opportunity this
[36:46] morning just to give him thanks and
[36:48] praise.
[36:50] Wonderful Lord Jesus. How we love you,
[36:53] Lord. Amen.
[36:56] Amen. Well, you have a few things to say
[37:00] before we start the message this
[37:03] morning. We're really grateful
[37:06] to see everyone here, those that may be
[37:08] visiting and those that have been
[37:10] welcomed. We welcome you in the name of
[37:13] the Lord Jesus Christ.
[37:16] Only one service today.
[37:19] Brother Tony will be speaking on
[37:22] Wednesday night. So, we'll be able to
[37:25] hear of all of their uh journeys at the
[37:29] meetings and what God has done in the
[37:33] last three months or so in uh Middle
[37:37] East countries.
[37:39] Uh we
[37:41] are so
[37:43] thankful for the hour that we're in.
[37:47] &gt;&gt; It's a golden age.
[37:50] &gt;&gt; It's an age that's full of uh uh many
[37:54] events
[37:55] and we're not able to even keep a breast
[37:57] of them.
[37:59] I thought of the scripture this morning
[38:01] that when Jesus had spoke in Matthew 24
[38:06] and we will be there a little later on
[38:09] but he said when you see the abomination
[38:11] of the desolation spoken of by Daniel
[38:13] the prophet stand in the holy place and
[38:16] then he added these words who so readeth
[38:20] let him understand didn't say who so
[38:22] seeth in other words we don't have to
[38:25] wait for the event people see events and
[38:28] then they at all. Oh, where is that? No,
[38:31] what we need to do is we see it written,
[38:34] &gt;&gt; we hear hear it spoken by God's
[38:36] messenger, and that's sufficient.
[38:40] &gt;&gt; It's as it's as good as done.
[38:43] &gt;&gt; When we hear it, and when we see it
[38:45] written, who so readth, let him
[38:48] understand.
[38:50] &gt;&gt; If we have to wait to see it to get all
[38:54] inspired, you're too late.
[38:56] &gt;&gt; That's the whole problem. always been
[38:58] too late. Wasn't Elijah supposed to
[39:00] come? Isn't the rapture supposed to
[39:01] come? That's too late. It's who so
[39:04] readeth, let them understand because uh
[39:07] the believer who receives the word by
[39:09] faith, it's already finished. It's
[39:12] already finished. Whether we live to see
[39:13] it or don't live to see it or whatever
[39:15] or it may happen and we wouldn't even I
[39:18] be able to identify it exactly, but once
[39:21] we read it, let him understand it's a
[39:24] finished fact.
[39:25] &gt;&gt; Amen. So we approach him that way.
[39:29] I want to
[39:32] uh make uh a couple of announcements and
[39:37] next Sunday also is one service uh and
[39:41] we're we're dealing with uh in the
[39:43] complications at the border and there
[39:46] are going to be some added complications
[39:49] because the uh on the US uh border at
[39:53] peace arts they're going to commence uh
[39:56] going to commence construction uh they
[39:58] have commenced construction but they're
[39:59] going to shut down some of the lanes
[40:01] that they have there. And so we're we're
[40:04] looking at that to address that
[40:06] situation.
[40:07] Uh our brother DJ's father, brother
[40:10] Coli, was taken to the hospital
[40:13] and uh uh they've determined that
[40:16] they've given him a calf scan right away
[40:18] and they've determined that there's some
[40:20] bleeding in the brain, which is not
[40:22] good. Uh they're taking him to the Royal
[40:26] Colombian Hospital. So, we want to have
[40:29] prayer for him this morning. And I have
[40:31] a couple other requests. I know you've
[40:33] had prayer already, but my aunt, my aunt
[40:36] Ethel, uh, she's in the hospital. I told
[40:39] her yesterday that we would be
[40:42] remembering her and this whole
[40:43] congregation. We remember her in prayer.
[40:45] She's of a Catholic background, same
[40:47] background. My parents came from, same
[40:51] family. and uh uh but she has she has
[40:55] seen so many things. uh she has been to
[40:59] various weddings and different functions
[41:02] here at the church and uh I believe she
[41:05] was speaking to uh Sister Keer once
[41:10] and uh uh they got talking about their
[41:13] background and I somebody said I don't
[41:15] know whether it was uh Sister Keer said
[41:17] to her that you know uh well I don't
[41:20] know why I wasn't here or something and
[41:21] she says well I don't know why I'm not
[41:23] here too sort of thing and that's kind
[41:25] of the mind she actually came over to
[41:27] our house here just a few weeks ago and
[41:30] she wanted me to pray for her. That's
[41:32] never happened in all these years. She
[41:34] wanted prayer. She asked that we would
[41:36] remember her in prayer again. And uh she
[41:39] goes in for open heart surgery uh this
[41:42] week, I think about Thursday. So if you
[41:45] just remember her, I can see a light is
[41:48] turning on on the inside and she has
[41:51] more confidence in in uh your prayers.
[41:56] Uh and and so I I just am praying for
[41:59] illumination in her soul. And I I've
[42:02] spoken to her very very directly about
[42:04] salvation, about calling on the name of
[42:06] the Lord and being saved. I'd like to
[42:09] remember also brother Jim Douly's family
[42:14] uh brother Jim's uh sister her her name
[42:17] is Win she passed away yesterday morning
[42:20] he said just about the time of sunrise
[42:22] she passed into eternity and he had
[42:26] prayed with her also dealt with her she
[42:29] also is from a Catholic background as
[42:31] brother Jim is and uh
[42:36] uh he said that she had made her peace
[42:38] with God and he was satisfied with that.
[42:41] Uh he was still looking to the Lord
[42:43] knowing that all things are possible
[42:45] with God. She was 64 years old. uh and
[42:50] uh but she has passed away. Her funeral
[42:52] service will be on Tuesday. And I
[42:56] although brother Jim Douly is not one
[42:58] that shows he doesn't show his burdens
[43:02] and he doesn't speak his burdens to
[43:04] others, but I I felt led of the Lord to
[43:08] say some things to him in an email. Uh
[43:11] he has been a real tower of strength not
[43:14] only within his family but his extended
[43:16] family. And you know, sometimes it takes
[43:19] a crisis just such as this for an
[43:22] unbelieving person to finally reach the
[43:25] point where they can say, "It's your God
[43:27] that I trust in.
[43:29] &gt;&gt; It's your God that I recognize. The God
[43:31] you serve is God." And so, however,
[43:35] whatever it takes, we just pray. I pray
[43:37] that people don't have to wait that
[43:39] long. I would like to serve God all my
[43:42] life. Wouldn't you? And so you young
[43:45] people, you have such a you have a
[43:47] privilege that many people don't get to
[43:50] have and we want to so I want to
[43:53] remember the Douly family. So I wonder
[43:56] if you would just stand with me once
[43:58] again before we go any further in the
[44:00] service. I'd like to remember these
[44:02] three
[44:03] and uh um
[44:08] I'd like to sing Bring all your needs to
[44:10] the altar.
[44:12] Brother Ryan,
[44:16] bring all your knees to
[44:21] the altar.
[44:25] [Music]
[44:27] Oh, great
[44:29] [Music]
[44:30] to
[44:34] [Music]
[44:36] for
[44:42] a
[44:44] to help you.
[44:47] Oh, bring all your peace to the Lord.
[44:54] &gt;&gt; And I felt we would sing that, but then
[44:56] I would like to add another verse to
[45:00] that and that is leave it there. Leave
[45:03] it there.
[45:05] Amen.
[45:07] &gt;&gt; Once you've brought your need to the
[45:09] altar, don't go and pack it away. Leave
[45:12] it there. Leave all all your burdens
[45:15] there. Leave it there. Leave it there.
[45:17] Take your burdens to the Lord and leave
[45:19] it there.
[45:22] &gt;&gt; Leave it there.
[45:26] Leave it there.
[45:29] Take your burdens to the Lord and leave
[45:34] it there.
[45:37] If you trust and never doubt, he will
[45:41] surely bring you out. Oh, take your
[45:45] burdens to the Lord and leave it there.
[45:51] Leave it there.
[45:54] [Applause]
[45:55] Leave it there.
[45:58] Oh, take your words to the Lord and be
[46:03] there.
[46:06] If you trust and never down, he will
[46:10] surely bring you out. take your burdens
[46:15] to the Lord and be there.
[46:20] &gt;&gt; And that's exactly what we're doing,
[46:22] Lord Jesus. We've brought our needs to
[46:24] the altar. We've heard the prayer that's
[46:27] been prayed earlier in the service. And
[46:30] we thank you, oh God, for the faith that
[46:32] is in the hearts of the people. And
[46:34] faith that cometh by the word of God, by
[46:37] hearing the word, by receiving the word,
[46:40] and by believing it. You've made so many
[46:43] promises, Lord, and we have no one else
[46:45] to come to. So, we're coming, Lord, and
[46:48] we're leaving our burden here. We're
[46:50] asking that you'll be with brother uh
[46:52] Jim and sister Lynn, oh God, and the
[46:55] extended family. The words that have
[46:58] been spoken, oh God, I pray the words
[47:01] that have been spoken by brother Jim
[47:03] will be so anchored, oh God, and as the
[47:06] as the rest of the family looks to him
[47:08] as a spiritual guide, spiritual counsel,
[47:12] I pray the Holy Spirit will be in
[47:14] attendance. Lord, just anchor the words.
[47:17] I pray illuminate darkened places, oh
[47:20] God, and darkened hearts. And may they
[47:23] who are still unbelieving receive you. I
[47:26] know this is brother Jim Sister Lynn's
[47:28] prayer. And all that are uh all that are
[47:32] part of the family, I pray that you will
[47:34] deal with them. And now, Lord, we're
[47:36] lifting up our brother Columb.
[47:39] You've been so gracious to him, oh God.
[47:42] He's been in several crises, but you
[47:44] have intervened time after time. And I
[47:47] know, oh God, brother Dier, sister Les
[47:49] Leanne are praying. I know that Sister
[47:52] Columbi is praying. And so you have said
[47:54] in your word, when one suffers, we all
[47:57] suffer. When one rejoices, we all
[48:00] rejoice. So we all are praying now, our
[48:02] Lord. Now we're praying for these that
[48:05] are carrying this burden. And we're
[48:07] praying, oh God, that you will deliver,
[48:10] I pray, to the room where brother Columb
[48:12] is. Deliver the sufficient virtue, oh
[48:16] God. Deliver, I pray, the power that
[48:19] will cauterize the bleeding, oh God. And
[48:22] that the bleeding may cease. Father, we
[48:25] have here even standing in the in the
[48:27] service this morning our sister Sally
[48:29] Dodds who the medical science and the
[48:32] medical profession gave up on said she
[48:35] couldn't survive. Oh God, but you wrote
[48:38] a different record. You brought her out,
[48:41] Lord, and she's with us this morning
[48:43] worshiping and she's been with us all
[48:45] this time. And I pray you'll raise up
[48:48] brother Columb. Oh God, raise him up
[48:50] once again in the name of Jesus Christ.
[48:53] hear us, Father. Do what we cannot do,
[48:56] but we're believing your word and
[48:58] trusting you. And my aunt, oh God,
[49:00] sister, in my sister's aunt, Father, I
[49:04] pray that you will remember her, oh God.
[49:06] And she's a got a soft heart, Lord. Pray
[49:09] you'll touch her heart, Father. I ask
[49:12] that you'll illuminate, Lord, and brush
[49:14] aside all the darkness in the traditions
[49:17] of that church. Oh God, I pray you'll
[49:19] move it aside and let her spirit taste
[49:22] of truth, Father. She believe she's seen
[49:25] it. She has seen it in your in your
[49:27] believers, Father. And I pray, oh God,
[49:29] that you'll satisfy that hunger and see
[49:32] her through this operation, oh God, as
[49:34] as it is needed. And I ask, Father, for
[49:37] your grace upon her life. And now,
[49:38] Father, we'll soon be turning to the
[49:41] word. I ask that you will just give
[49:43] special utterance to your word in Jesus
[49:45] Christ's name. Amen.
[49:47] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[49:48] &gt;&gt; Amen. God bless you. Just while you're
[49:50] standing, before we read the scripture,
[49:52] I want to give a special thanks on
[49:54] behalf of uh Brother Randy sent me an
[49:57] email said to be sure and thank you. I
[49:59] spoke with brother uh Chris Peterson
[50:01] this morning as well. And brother Randy,
[50:04] both of them. We the the men all the men
[50:06] that came to the camp the last two days.
[50:10] It's just absolutely miraculous. You can
[50:12] see some uh pictures if you wish on the
[50:14] notice board outside. wanted to have a
[50:16] few slides for you this morning, but we
[50:18] have so much to to go through. Uh, but
[50:22] it was they just started from a slab, a
[50:24] cement slab, and in the two days the
[50:27] whole building is up. The partitions are
[50:29] all in. Some of the plumbing is already
[50:32] been finished. The roof is just got to
[50:35] be sheetated. It's all on and tar
[50:37] papered and the trusses are up is and
[50:40] two days. This building's 24x 40 ft.
[50:44] This is no small shack. It's uh houses
[50:47] all the electrical equipment and the
[50:49] sprinkler system and the uh washrooms
[50:52] for ladies and men. So when we have
[50:55] special meetings, we will have be able
[50:57] to have those washrooms. And it gave us
[50:59] more room in the chapel. I pasted out uh
[51:03] Friday when I was there and that chapel
[51:05] will probably seat 325 people
[51:08] comfortably. And that's very very
[51:10] wonderful. It's going to be a wonderful
[51:13] um uh a wonderful facility. Now, I just
[51:15] want to have you standing for a few
[51:17] minutes cuz I'm going to be standing for
[51:19] a while yet, too. So, that's fine. You
[51:23] folks get to sit down five minutes or
[51:25] so.
[51:28] I have never really spoken what my
[51:30] vision for this camp has been.
[51:33] Well, you might as well sit down.
[51:42] Thank you.
[51:44] But soon as we say camp here, the only
[51:47] uh the only mental picture I think that
[51:50] we have as you know we have a youth
[51:52] camp, we have a family camp etc etc. My
[51:55] vision for the camp has been completely
[51:58] different from day one. Absolutely
[52:00] different from day one. And I was even
[52:03] waiting till we would have a
[52:04] presentation to be able to show you. so
[52:07] that you could follow through
[52:08] pictorially and and visually uh see
[52:11] what's going to uh take place. I'm
[52:15] looking upon it as being
[52:18] um moving towards and eventually being a
[52:21] believer's retreat. when we want to go
[52:24] someplace,
[52:26] believers,
[52:27] uh, well, we we go, you know, every
[52:30] place we go, even if it's to go out and
[52:33] have a something to eat, it's always a
[52:36] worldly atmosphere and with worldly
[52:38] people and so on so forth. So I looked
[52:41] upon this as a yearround
[52:45] place where believers can go
[52:49] because the camp as it is right now,
[52:52] excuse me, and the way they've operated
[52:54] it,
[52:57] they've been able to have uh several
[53:00] camps going simultaneously. They might
[53:02] have one. One time when I was there some
[53:05] months ago, they had a a Korean
[53:07] Christian group was up in one area about
[53:10] 18 or so, and they would cook for
[53:13] themselves as they wanted to cook for
[53:15] themselves. Then there was a group down
[53:18] here that was about 50 people, but they
[53:20] needed uh meals from the dining room.
[53:23] And then there was a larger group and
[53:25] they of course were having meals from
[53:27] the dining room. So in the meantime, uh,
[53:31] Bill and Donna Gene who have been
[53:33] managing the camp out there, they always
[53:36] are, you know, uh, needing to handle all
[53:39] the logistics of who's coming and what
[53:41] will be needed, etc. And I think doing a
[53:44] lot of that manually. Uh, brother Jack
[53:46] Aguiri has has been taken on and he is,
[53:50] uh, learning all that aspect of it. But
[53:53] I envision that let's say that uh uh any
[54:00] of you families that are here, you may
[54:02] have some uh believers that are visiting
[54:06] you or some of your family that's
[54:08] visiting you and would want to be able
[54:11] to take them out. And I think I've just
[54:13] said a wee bit about this before, but
[54:16] now I want to enlarge on it a wee bit.
[54:19] And I could say that there would be
[54:21] perhaps a group of of of people from the
[54:24] church or families from the church, uh,
[54:28] visiting friends coming from overseas or
[54:31] coming from wherever. And to be able to
[54:34] go out there at any time of the year,
[54:37] winter or summer, to be able to go out
[54:40] there and say, "Well, you know, this
[54:42] time we we'll we'll we'll look after our
[54:45] own meals or this time we would sooner,
[54:48] you know, just have the meals in the
[54:50] dining room and then to be able to
[54:53] utilize that as a place where you can
[54:56] just go. I'd like to take my family. I'd
[54:58] like two, three of our families, we'd
[55:00] want to go or some of our friends, we
[55:02] want to go and we're just going to spend
[55:04] uh uh some of the time out there even if
[55:07] it was over a weekend because you're
[55:09] only one hour at the most to come into
[55:12] church and you could attend attend. So,
[55:14] you're don't have to give up services
[55:16] like going to the mountain someplace and
[55:18] well, we can't get to church because
[55:19] we're 3 4 hours away or 5 hours away.
[55:23] You won't be in that situation. and and
[55:26] uh to be able to make use of this place.
[55:29] It's a place where the the school can go
[55:31] out and have a a nature study and be
[55:35] overnight and maybe be over a couple of
[55:37] days uh some of the seniors from the
[55:40] school. Um uh and then we're it's open
[55:43] to us to use for say for families. We
[55:46] could have uh we could have ministers uh
[55:50] gatherings there. We can have just any
[55:54] number of people within the
[55:55] congregation. We want to be able to open
[55:57] it up and other congregations of
[55:59] believers and they that may want to come
[56:01] from other places because it will be uh
[56:05] it was so magnificent. I understand that
[56:07] when we were all done on Friday night, I
[56:09] left uh about quarter 6 and uh and the
[56:14] brothers were just winding up some of
[56:16] the work there. Uh, I guess the moon
[56:19] came out over Mount Baker and uh the
[56:22] beauty of it all that Brother Chris,
[56:24] didn't you just stay there? See, he
[56:27] stays there all day, but it it's so
[56:29] beautiful. He just couldn't tear himself
[56:31] away. So, he just sat down and drank in
[56:34] the beauty of it. It was just so so
[56:37] marvelous. I'd like I'd like to say also
[56:40] about the So, it's not merely a camp. It
[56:44] is a believer's retreat.
[56:47] And I'm I would like you to become
[56:49] acquainted with that term, a believer's
[56:51] retreat. It's a place where you could
[56:53] perhaps go on and we want to I'm
[56:56] trusting that brother Darren will be
[56:57] able to write the program. They're
[56:59] looking into the programs right now
[57:01] where you would be able to go on and
[57:04] say, do you know what? We just like to
[57:05] get away. There's eight or 10 of us or
[57:07] whatever more. There's three or four
[57:09] families. We just like to get away or
[57:11] and we like to be there. You be able to
[57:13] go on to the website. The website is
[57:15] already finished. If you went on to it,
[57:18] uh it's mountbaker
[57:20] Bibleway.org,
[57:22] I believe. And uh it's a beautiful
[57:25] website, but we're going to be adding to
[57:27] that website. So, you'll be able to go
[57:28] on and find what what what cabins and
[57:32] what facilities are available. You could
[57:34] just click on there and see that. Oh,
[57:37] that's available from Thursday right
[57:38] through to Monday. Okay. We'd like to
[57:41] stay there. Yes, we'd like to stay
[57:42] there. Click. Okay, it's available. We
[57:45] have it. Uh, do you want meals? Yes,
[57:47] we'd like to have meals. So then already
[57:50] the the dining room knows that you're
[57:53] you're going to be there. Believers are
[57:54] going to be there. And uh so I envision
[57:58] it to be entirely utilized by believers
[58:03] eventually. That's the direction. And uh
[58:06] it it and quite frankly it's a it's a
[58:10] very very uh very it's not just a
[58:13] possibility. I believe you'll live to
[58:15] see that's exactly what's going to
[58:16] happen unless the Lord takes us in the
[58:18] rapture and we'll be camping on the
[58:20] hills of glory. So and that that'll be
[58:22] fine with us. And when you see the
[58:26] number of uh people both children and
[58:30] young people that are adults in this
[58:33] tank and how many of them I have
[58:36] counseledled with and they also how many
[58:38] have stood in this tank and said uh
[58:42] asked when did God deal with you? They
[58:46] said in two years ago or three years ago
[58:49] at camp the speaker was so and so and
[58:52] they were speaking on a certain subject
[58:54] or it was a certain evening and God
[58:57] spoke to me that night and that is when
[59:00] God dealt with me and then they end up
[59:02] in the baptismal tank and many of you
[59:05] are sitting here this morning. That's
[59:07] what it's all about. You see we talk
[59:10] about families. There's a lot of singles
[59:13] here. There's couples without children
[59:15] here. Don't forget you. It's you don't
[59:18] you're not without a family.
[59:21] &gt;&gt; You singles are not without a family.
[59:23] You that don't have children, you're not
[59:25] without a family. You empty nesters,
[59:27] you're not without a family. You widows
[59:29] that are here, you're not without a
[59:31] family. Your family right here. Your
[59:33] children are right here. And that I'm
[59:35] not that's not poetic license. You need
[59:38] to have a burden for the young people
[59:40] and for the children that are right
[59:41] here. and the energy you spend at this
[59:44] kind of facility, God will honor it.
[59:47] &gt;&gt; I was moved this morning as I thought
[59:48] about this. Brother Randy, he has a a
[59:51] phrase and I'm looking at some of his
[59:54] daughters right now and he says the
[59:56] reason why they're here, it's not been
[59:59] easy. It's been a difficult adjustment
[1:00:01] and coming from a secure job and and the
[1:00:05] the uprooting from Phoenix and the area
[1:00:09] and the nice weather and the sunshine to
[1:00:12] come and it's been a horrific uh change
[1:00:16] for them and it's not been easy. But
[1:00:19] Ry's phrase is it's a family.
[1:00:23] We feel as a family. my my children feel
[1:00:27] that bond of a family. And he said, "I'm
[1:00:30] doing this because it's a family." And
[1:00:33] you wouldn't believe the amount amount
[1:00:34] of days and time that he spent on this
[1:00:38] because to him, it's the family of God.
[1:00:41] And I know that he's got his family. And
[1:00:44] brother Chris, you and Sister Cigarette,
[1:00:46] I'd like to say something.
[1:00:51] They don't have children,
[1:00:53] but I haven't found anybody more devoted
[1:00:56] and more dedicated for the families and
[1:00:59] for the children and for the people of
[1:01:02] this congregation. You've been so giving
[1:01:04] of yourself and generous to see that
[1:01:08] these things happen. And I say, God
[1:01:11] bless you.
[1:01:13] &gt;&gt; God bless you immensely.
[1:01:25] And I think you know that comes from my
[1:01:27] heart.
[1:01:32] It will be a place where many people
[1:01:34] will be blessed.
[1:01:36] Many people will be able to get away
[1:01:38] from the pressures of life and just
[1:01:40] spend some time. Brother Joseph
[1:01:44] and brother James Lei, brother Joseph
[1:01:47] took the responsibility of seeing that
[1:01:49] everything was happening.
[1:01:51] And uh this next Saturday, this is this
[1:01:54] is the kind of the final push. Friday,
[1:01:57] Saturday is the last two days. We expect
[1:02:00] to have the bathrooms completely
[1:02:02] finished, perhaps drywalled inside and
[1:02:04] everything. So I would So I'll just say
[1:02:07] this and it's not only that then we're
[1:02:09] just restoring the they're going to seed
[1:02:11] and restore the whole grounds and it's
[1:02:14] in it's just going to be uh really
[1:02:17] really lovely and once it's done there's
[1:02:20] no possibility of going back and doing
[1:02:22] it again. I know when this church was
[1:02:24] finished and uh brothers who worked day
[1:02:27] after day after day for three months
[1:02:30] when it was all done, I had so many come
[1:02:33] to me said, "We're sorry. It's over. We
[1:02:36] just got to a place we so enjoyed being
[1:02:38] with one another." So, you don't have to
[1:02:40] be a carpenter. You don't have to be
[1:02:41] skilled. And you don't have to be called
[1:02:43] on. You can phone Brother Jack or
[1:02:46] Brother Chris and say, "I'm available.
[1:02:48] Is there anything to do? I you know I
[1:02:51] can handle a shovel or a rake or
[1:02:52] whatever more and if there's anything to
[1:02:54] do you could just do that because we
[1:02:56] don't want to you know be necessarily
[1:02:58] making these announcements but uh next
[1:03:01] next uh Friday and Saturday is the final
[1:03:04] push. So as many as can come especially
[1:03:07] those that were there the last time and
[1:03:09] framers and skilled carpenters etc.
[1:03:11] drywallers we would appreciate it. God
[1:03:14] bless you. I just had that on my heart.
[1:03:19] Thank you. Now, if you wish to stand and
[1:03:22] we'll read.
[1:03:26] Sorry to be so long, but I enjoyed those
[1:03:28] songs. Didn't you?
[1:03:30] &gt;&gt; Both the groups that sang and the
[1:03:32] Russian group and the other
[1:03:37] brothers and sisters that sang that
[1:03:38] first song. It's really wonderful.
[1:03:42] Turn with me, would you, to Matthew 24,
[1:03:45] the uh the we'll read verses 1 to3.
[1:03:53] And I'd like if you would just ask God
[1:03:55] to do something special for you right
[1:03:58] now in this service.
[1:04:00] Just say, I'm I'm asking, Father, for
[1:04:03] the illumination of the Holy Spirit.
[1:04:06] Come to me personally. That's what I'm
[1:04:09] going to pray that God will just take
[1:04:11] charge of the entire
[1:04:14] rest of the service and the word and the
[1:04:17] preaching of it. Oh God. Oh God. We're
[1:04:20] going to read in just a few moments.
[1:04:22] Lord, we're going to read, but we need
[1:04:25] you. We need you, oh God. We want you to
[1:04:29] be the one that speaks. We want your
[1:04:31] thoughts to be made known. Father, in
[1:04:34] the name of Jesus Christ, I pray that
[1:04:37] you will take supreme control for your
[1:04:40] glory and your honor. Amen.
[1:04:43] Amen.
[1:04:45] Matthew 24:es
[1:04:48] 1 2 and 3. And Jesus went out and
[1:04:51] departed from the temple, and his
[1:04:54] disciples came to him for to show him
[1:04:56] the buildings of the temple. And Jesus
[1:04:59] said unto them,
[1:05:01] See ye not all these things. Verily I
[1:05:05] say unto you, there shall not be left
[1:05:08] here one stone upon another that shall
[1:05:11] not be thrown down. And as he sat upon
[1:05:15] the mount of olives, the disciples came
[1:05:18] unto him privately, saying, tell us,
[1:05:21] when shall these things be, and what
[1:05:24] shall be the sign of thy coming and of
[1:05:27] the end of the world? God bless you. You
[1:05:30] may have your seats, and I would ask you
[1:05:31] to keep your Bibles open, please, to
[1:05:33] that 24th chapter. I'll be referring to
[1:05:35] quite a few other verses.
[1:05:38] Now
[1:05:40] Jesus actually gives an overview and
[1:05:43] you'll just need your full focus on the
[1:05:46] service and as little movement as
[1:05:47] possible because this may feel like a
[1:05:51] little bit laborious but I I need to uh
[1:05:55] uh I I want to give you quite a few
[1:05:57] quotes and they do tie beautifully
[1:05:59] together. But Jesus gives an overview in
[1:06:03] chapter 24.
[1:06:05] And the overview has to do with the
[1:06:09] Gentiles and the gospel going to the
[1:06:12] Gentiles. It has to do with the
[1:06:14] tribulation and what takes place in
[1:06:17] Jerusalem and its destruction. And it
[1:06:20] also gives the gospel going to the Jews.
[1:06:25] So the destruction uh of the temple, the
[1:06:29] uh tribulation period and the gospel
[1:06:33] going to the Gentiles and his coming.
[1:06:37] Those are the things that is a is a he
[1:06:40] he gives an overview and brother
[1:06:42] Brandham uh says about the three
[1:06:45] questions and the three questions are
[1:06:47] tell us when these things shall be.
[1:06:51] What shall be the sign of thy coming
[1:06:55] and of the end of the world? Those are
[1:06:58] the three questions brother Brandham
[1:07:00] says about those three questions in the
[1:07:02] flashing red light. They ask three
[1:07:05] questions and he answers back three
[1:07:08] questions. When will there come a time
[1:07:11] when there won't be left one stone upon
[1:07:14] another? What's the sign of your coming?
[1:07:17] And what about the end of the world? He
[1:07:20] says, "And many I believe and that we
[1:07:23] brethren make mistakes by trying to
[1:07:26] apply it all to his coming." But he's
[1:07:29] answering three different questions that
[1:07:32] was asked him. And he starts off asking
[1:07:35] one answering one about when the stones
[1:07:39] won't be left uh not one upon another.
[1:07:43] And then after he finishes that
[1:07:45] question, then he starts off the sign of
[1:07:48] his coming and then goes into the end of
[1:07:51] the world. Now uh as soon as brother
[1:07:54] Brandham finishes that part then he
[1:07:57] takes for a text and I should tell you
[1:07:59] that
[1:08:01] I was uh directed by the Holy Spirit to
[1:08:05] to go to Matthew 24 and so I was uh uh I
[1:08:09] hadn't even really got into it yet. And
[1:08:12] also I felt as though I should be uh
[1:08:15] directing my thoughts to a certain
[1:08:17] message. So I thought of uh another
[1:08:20] message uh other than uh the flashing
[1:08:24] red light. I thought of warning than
[1:08:27] judgment because my thoughts were so
[1:08:29] much on judgment and I wanted to bring
[1:08:32] it but I I I felt directed that I should
[1:08:35] be bringing it in a certain way but I
[1:08:37] couldn't quite get that direction. And
[1:08:39] so then uh uh I was directed to flashing
[1:08:43] red light of his coming. And so I just
[1:08:46] put it on. I began to listen to that and
[1:08:49] immediately brother Brandham goes now to
[1:08:51] Matthew 24. Well, when you have that
[1:08:54] kind of thing happening, you know, and
[1:08:56] especially it's not just a thought that
[1:08:58] zaps into your mind with a minister,
[1:09:01] you're waiting and you're you're almost
[1:09:04] uh uh straining as it were in the
[1:09:06] traces. You're just what is it? You've
[1:09:08] got the radar out, you know, and I I
[1:09:11] feel led in this way. And then this
[1:09:13] thought here, you know, on on the
[1:09:15] judgment and and uh I want to bring it
[1:09:18] to the people and I see things happening
[1:09:20] that are taking place that God has
[1:09:22] spoken of. I'd like to bring that to the
[1:09:24] people because we don't want to be
[1:09:27] caught unawares.
[1:09:29] &gt;&gt; We we want to be informed ahead of time.
[1:09:32] &gt;&gt; And so and then you feel, okay, no, I I
[1:09:36] should listen to this or I should start
[1:09:38] reading this message. And I put it on. I
[1:09:40] was just listening to it. And then here
[1:09:41] he comes right away to Matthew 24 and he
[1:09:46] reads a text which actually starts in
[1:09:48] the 32nd verse of uh of chapter 24. And
[1:09:52] I'm going to read those as well. But he
[1:09:55] he he just finishes this text and then
[1:09:57] he goes right back to uh verses 1 2 and
[1:10:00] three about the three questions.
[1:10:03] So in verse 32,
[1:10:06] the scripture says, "Now learn a parable
[1:10:09] of a fig tree." Now let me just stop
[1:10:12] there and have you look this way one
[1:10:13] more moment. Now up to this time,
[1:10:17] remember Jesus is answering these
[1:10:19] questions.
[1:10:21] Uh what is uh when will these things be?
[1:10:24] When are these stones going to be torn
[1:10:26] down? So it won't be one upon another.
[1:10:29] And now try to put yourself back. Try to
[1:10:32] put yourself back into this time zone.
[1:10:37] Try to make yourself for a few moments
[1:10:39] this morning uh a believer. You're a
[1:10:42] believer. Not here in Cloverdale in this
[1:10:44] Cloverdale Bible Church, but you're back
[1:10:47] there and you're in Jerusalem and you
[1:10:49] you are impressed with the building and
[1:10:52] the stones and the many years that they
[1:10:55] were building and the skilled worksmen
[1:10:57] that put those stones together. and
[1:11:00] you're sufficiently impressed. You
[1:11:01] actually want the Lord Jesus who you
[1:11:04] know who he is. You want to show him the
[1:11:07] stones of the temple. Now, I'm sure he
[1:11:09] had seen the stones of the temple, but
[1:11:11] you're you're impressed with the
[1:11:13] disciples were impressed with it. It was
[1:11:15] a magnificent place. And so, they want
[1:11:17] him to see these stones. I'm sure it
[1:11:20] would come to you as a shock to have him
[1:11:23] say back to you, don't be impressed with
[1:11:25] this. Don't look at this because I tell
[1:11:28] you there there's coming a time there
[1:11:30] won't even be one stone left here upon
[1:11:32] another.
[1:11:34] &gt;&gt; It would be uh it would be a shock to
[1:11:36] you. It would be startling to you to
[1:11:40] look at this. You you're already looking
[1:11:42] at it. you you're there for the purpose
[1:11:44] of showing him and speaking about this
[1:11:47] magnificent structure and he's telling
[1:11:49] you don't look at this because there
[1:11:52] these stones there won't even be one
[1:11:54] left on another that must have seemed
[1:11:56] like such an impossibility to them and
[1:11:59] and now part of it is going to be
[1:12:02] because of judgment now remember
[1:12:05] God allowed judgment to come to Israel
[1:12:09] to come to Palestine and to the Jews in
[1:12:12] particular
[1:12:13] because that temple meant something very
[1:12:16] special to them and they the Rome that
[1:12:19] had control of Israel. Rome was kind of
[1:12:23] a uh uh they had a system by which all
[1:12:27] they wanted was control of lands and
[1:12:31] their kingdom was very extensive and
[1:12:34] they really didn't care how the people
[1:12:37] worshiped within that system. The system
[1:12:40] was to control this vast area. And so
[1:12:44] that is why they had their rulers and
[1:12:46] but then underneath that they had like
[1:12:48] the religious community, the Pharisees
[1:12:51] and and the Sadducees and they they were
[1:12:55] allowed to function and operate. They
[1:12:57] weren't restricted. But Rome just wanted
[1:12:59] to have control. Now, if you can keep
[1:13:02] your thoughts going and I pray that God
[1:13:04] will help me this morning because the
[1:13:07] pope that was just now in America, he
[1:13:10] had he had and I have here the record of
[1:13:12] he had uh the religious leaders of the
[1:13:15] world uh including Muslims, including
[1:13:19] Judaism and including the James from
[1:13:22] India. He had those there. there was no
[1:13:25] Christian representative because he was
[1:13:28] considered as the Christian
[1:13:29] representative of the Christian world
[1:13:32] and and they just had that meeting just
[1:13:34] taking place. You see, they really don't
[1:13:38] care if the James worship one way and
[1:13:42] the Muslims worship another way and the
[1:13:45] Jews want to worship another way. But
[1:13:47] they're seeking for control that's
[1:13:49] beyond
[1:13:50] &gt;&gt; and above exactly, you know, how you go
[1:13:53] and worship, whatever you want to do,
[1:13:55] fine. But they want control. That's all.
[1:13:57] That's the spirit that's been there
[1:13:59] since day one.
[1:14:04] And if this one is antichrist and this
[1:14:07] one's antichrist and the Muslim
[1:14:09] anti-word and the James anti-word and
[1:14:12] this one's anti-word and there all it is
[1:14:15] is a conglomeration of antichrist.
[1:14:18] &gt;&gt; They don't care if this one's this one's
[1:14:20] off the word and that one's off the word
[1:14:22] and that one's they're all off the word.
[1:14:24] But one who's off the word wants
[1:14:26] control.
[1:14:28] Yes, sir.
[1:14:29] &gt;&gt; They're not trying to bring everybody in
[1:14:30] line. They're not trying to make
[1:14:32] everybody Catholics.
[1:14:34] &gt;&gt; You have to understand that
[1:14:36] &gt;&gt; they're not trying to make everybody
[1:14:37] Catholics. I think this service today
[1:14:39] should be a real enlightenment for many
[1:14:41] of you.
[1:14:46] &gt;&gt; So Jesus describing these conditions and
[1:14:49] now brother Brandham takes Matthew 24
[1:14:54] and aligns it with the opening of the
[1:14:56] seals.
[1:14:59] You know that
[1:15:01] &gt;&gt; he aligns it with the opening of the
[1:15:02] seals. Then he says, "Now Jesus didn't
[1:15:06] say anything about the seventh seal."
[1:15:10] He comes down and ends it in verse uh
[1:15:14] 31.
[1:15:17] Sorry. Yes. Verse 31, he says, "And he
[1:15:21] shall send his angels with a great sound
[1:15:23] of a trumpet, and they shall gather
[1:15:25] together his elect from the four winds
[1:15:28] from the one end of heaven to the
[1:15:31] other." And it is one place at least,
[1:15:33] Brother Brham ties that to the gathering
[1:15:36] of the Jews back to Israel. He does it
[1:15:39] in fact in flashing red light of his
[1:15:41] coming. So he ties it and then because
[1:15:44] that is something that is actually part
[1:15:47] of the opening of the seals and then he
[1:15:50] says now in verse 32 he starts off in
[1:15:53] parables because it's a parable of his
[1:15:56] coming
[1:15:57] and the seventh seal is his coming.
[1:16:00] &gt;&gt; So he's starting off he says Jesus
[1:16:02] doesn't say anything about the seventh
[1:16:03] seal. All those seals are from the from
[1:16:06] the verse one through uh not actually
[1:16:10] verse one but like from about about
[1:16:12] verse 4 all to verse 31. And then he
[1:16:15] says then he starts off on parables. And
[1:16:18] the parable is now learn a parable.
[1:16:21] We're reading verse 32 of the fig tree
[1:16:24] when his branch is yet tender and
[1:16:27] putteth forth leaves. You know that
[1:16:29] summer is nigh. So likewise ye, when you
[1:16:33] shall see all these things, know that it
[1:16:36] is near, even at the doors. Verily I say
[1:16:39] unto you, this generation shall not pass
[1:16:43] till all these things be fulfilled.
[1:16:47] Heaven and earth shall pass away, but my
[1:16:50] words shall not pass away. You notice
[1:16:54] now I've been speaking also on the power
[1:16:56] of the word, the transforming power of
[1:16:59] the word. and uh about two services ago
[1:17:03] spoke of and took one line and I'll just
[1:17:06] bring it back to you now because this is
[1:17:08] anchored right back into it. And the the
[1:17:10] the the word is the agent
[1:17:16] for judgment.
[1:17:18] &gt;&gt; Because once it's spoken, whether you
[1:17:20] see it or not, maybe some of those
[1:17:23] disciples didn't all live to see the
[1:17:25] destruction of Jerusalem. But the
[1:17:28] nevertheless once Jesus spoke it, it was
[1:17:31] finished.
[1:17:33] &gt;&gt; The destruction was as sure as there.
[1:17:36] When uh when God speaks, thus sayith the
[1:17:38] Lord, Los Angeles is going to sink. You
[1:17:41] don't have to wait for an earthquake.
[1:17:43] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:17:44] &gt;&gt; The earthquake already took place when
[1:17:46] he spoke it.
[1:17:51] &gt;&gt; It's as good as done.
[1:17:53] &gt;&gt; If you wait for something physical to
[1:17:55] happen, say, "Oh, now let's look in the
[1:17:58] word." You're too late.
[1:18:00] &gt;&gt; It's far too late. Amen.
[1:18:03] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:18:04] &gt;&gt; And so he says, "Then you'll know that
[1:18:06] summer is nigh. Heaven and earth shall
[1:18:08] pass away, but my word shall not pass
[1:18:11] away, but of that day, of that day and
[1:18:15] hour, knoweth no man, know not the
[1:18:18] angels of heaven, but my father only."
[1:18:22] Now, just for this congregation, for
[1:18:24] those of you that understand the
[1:18:26] message, listen very closely. Many
[1:18:29] times, many times, brother Brandham
[1:18:32] refers to the coming of Christ and he
[1:18:37] does not use the word coming. He does
[1:18:40] not actually uh make direct reference to
[1:18:43] it, but he uses this scripture as a
[1:18:46] reference to it. He uses this one for no
[1:18:48] man knoweth the day or the hour. That's
[1:18:51] what he uses. And he expects a believer
[1:18:53] to catch that what he's referring to is
[1:18:56] the coming. No man knows the day of the
[1:18:59] hour. He'll say another place, no man
[1:19:01] knows, not even the angels know. No man
[1:19:03] knows, not even the son himself knows.
[1:19:05] And he'll make reference to it in
[1:19:06] different ways, but he doesn't refer to
[1:19:08] the he doesn't speak the words. Uh this
[1:19:11] is the coming of Christ or the second
[1:19:13] coming of Christ, but he's making direct
[1:19:16] reference to the coming because it is in
[1:19:18] parable form. And that's how he used it.
[1:19:21] You'll find it in the seals. You'll find
[1:19:23] it in the seventh seal. And so for those
[1:19:26] of you that are uh students of the
[1:19:28] message, you read and you listen to it,
[1:19:30] re remember my words. Now when you see
[1:19:33] that he's talking about the coming. So
[1:19:36] watch the context that he's speaking of
[1:19:38] it in when you come to that phrase.
[1:19:41] And then he ends this with this. This is
[1:19:43] the ending of his text. But as the days
[1:19:45] of Noah were, so shall also the coming
[1:19:49] of the son of man be. as the days of
[1:19:52] Noah. Then he goes into the conditions
[1:19:55] of of uh Noah's time which we will touch
[1:19:58] some on that now. So Jesus
[1:20:02] is describing the conditions. What Jesus
[1:20:05] is doing is describing the conditions
[1:20:08] that will exist in the times in the era
[1:20:11] of these three questions. When will
[1:20:14] these things be? So he tells them what
[1:20:16] the abomination of Daniel spoken of the
[1:20:19] abomination as spoken by Daniel the
[1:20:22] prophet and what's going to happen and
[1:20:24] he that's on the rooftop don't even come
[1:20:26] down and that's going to be it's going
[1:20:28] to be a destruction like has never been
[1:20:31] and he's speaking then about that. So he
[1:20:33] tells them the conditions that are going
[1:20:35] to exist at that time.
[1:20:39] how he also speaks to the conditions
[1:20:42] that are going to exist in our time and
[1:20:47] we're seeing those conditions but we
[1:20:49] don't need to see every detail when we
[1:20:52] read it. Let him who readth understand
[1:20:56] &gt;&gt; that this is the time and let's live as
[1:21:00] we as though we understand it. Let's not
[1:21:02] be consumed by consu with consumerism.
[1:21:06] Let's not be consumed with popularity or
[1:21:09] fashion. Let's not be consumed with the
[1:21:12] things of this life because they are
[1:21:14] passing away.
[1:21:17] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:21:17] &gt;&gt; So Jesus speaks about the tribulation.
[1:21:20] He speaks about God's dealing with the
[1:21:22] Jews. And then also brother Brandham
[1:21:24] makes a reference to that in the seventh
[1:21:26] seal. He said he speaks now uh 1,000
[1:21:30] years on earth is only one day with God
[1:21:33] and 3 and 1/2 years talking about the 3
[1:21:36] and 1/2 years of tribulation. He said
[1:21:38] what would it go to so many seconds in
[1:21:41] God's time? He said that's the reason he
[1:21:44] said now watch those words. I'm I'm very
[1:21:47] very I'm very personnicity about the
[1:21:51] words even one word sometimes he said
[1:21:54] and that's the reason he said it's at it
[1:21:58] is at the door.
[1:22:00] &gt;&gt; That's the reason he said that's it's at
[1:22:02] the door because it's such a brief
[1:22:05] period of time. He said, "Verily,
[1:22:07] verily, I say unto you that this
[1:22:09] generation shall not be consumed or done
[1:22:12] away with this people." In brackets,
[1:22:16] "Until all these things are," and he
[1:22:19] stops. He said, "What what won't be done
[1:22:22] away with? They've tried to kill the Jew
[1:22:24] off the earth all the time. They'll
[1:22:27] never be able to do it." See that? That
[1:22:30] won't that generation won't pass away.
[1:22:32] It won't they won't be able to destroy
[1:22:34] it. And he and he said the generation
[1:22:37] what generation that generation shall
[1:22:40] not be consumed or done away with until
[1:22:43] all these things are what? What won't be
[1:22:46] done away with? They've tried to kill
[1:22:48] the Jew. They won't be able to do away
[1:22:50] with them. Hey, they're they're
[1:22:52] completely surrounded
[1:22:54] &gt;&gt; with multiplied millions of people
[1:22:58] intent on their total destruction.
[1:23:01] Right.
[1:23:03] &gt;&gt; And the world is calling for them to
[1:23:06] make peace with them. In fact, is
[1:23:08] America and the United uh nations and
[1:23:13] the United European nations. This is not
[1:23:16] a political sermon. Now we we're but
[1:23:18] this is just a good background. They are
[1:23:21] all putting forward. It is the it has to
[1:23:24] be the epitome of hypocrisy. They're all
[1:23:27] putting forward pressure on that little
[1:23:30] nation to give up land, to pay the bills
[1:23:34] of their enemies to do all kinds of
[1:23:36] things. And not one of those nations
[1:23:38] would do that.
[1:23:40] &gt;&gt; Not one of those nations would take
[1:23:42] their an enemy who says, "We're out to
[1:23:44] destroy you." There isn't one of those
[1:23:46] nations would put up with that.
[1:23:48] &gt;&gt; But they're pressuring Israel. This
[1:23:50] thing, that's why I can say this is not
[1:23:53] a physical war. It's a spiritual war.
[1:23:56] It's it's not even based on it's not
[1:23:58] even based on human common sense. You
[1:24:01] can't even feature a man who who's who's
[1:24:03] mature or a woman who's mature mentally
[1:24:06] that would say this is your enemy. Feed
[1:24:08] them. Make a way for them. Pay their
[1:24:10] bills. Do this. It has nothing to do
[1:24:13] with accepting them as a people. Say
[1:24:16] accept these as a people. They don't
[1:24:18] want to be accepted. They want control.
[1:24:21] What man is going to allow a a a
[1:24:23] neighbor to take that position of and
[1:24:26] even displace a father in a family or or
[1:24:29] or or a country, a nation, nobody's
[1:24:32] prepared to do that. And so he says, so
[1:24:36] notice
[1:24:38] the very generation of Jews that seen
[1:24:40] the return back to Palestine, that
[1:24:43] generation would see these things
[1:24:45] happen. So he says that generation that
[1:24:49] returns to Palestine, they will see
[1:24:51] these things happen. And just the last
[1:24:53] two and a half years, this is in the
[1:24:55] seventh seal, something you probably
[1:24:57] want to mark down. Remember, in just the
[1:25:01] last two and a half years, she was fully
[1:25:04] become a nation with her own money and
[1:25:08] whatever. And there she is
[1:25:13] in the feast of the trumpets. He said,
[1:25:16] "Now Pentecost
[1:25:19] finishes at the period of the seventh
[1:25:21] seal."
[1:25:24] In the seventh seal, he says also that
[1:25:27] this seal is the end of all things. It
[1:25:29] goes right on to the even the very very
[1:25:31] end of time. So the seventh seal, it
[1:25:34] isn't as though you have a a cut off
[1:25:35] date for it. But the Pentecost feast
[1:25:39] finishes at the period of the seventh
[1:25:41] seal. For the next is the coming of
[1:25:44] Christ.
[1:25:45] And also
[1:25:47] the trumpet is sound for the Jews. I got
[1:25:51] this on a slide. Later on I'll show you.
[1:25:54] Also the trumpet is sound for the Jews.
[1:25:57] Their sixth trumpet is sound. And when
[1:26:00] it does, it makes known to them the
[1:26:02] revealed son of God.
[1:26:05] 1 half hour is fixed. And remember, all
[1:26:08] trumpets sound on the sixth seal. The
[1:26:12] sixth seal finishes the mystery under
[1:26:14] the sixth seal just before the seventh
[1:26:17] opened.
[1:26:18] &gt;&gt; The seventh is the coming
[1:26:21] &gt;&gt; of Christ. Amen.
[1:26:25] &gt;&gt; And uh
[1:26:27] and now I I'm referring to some of the
[1:26:29] some of the scriptures so you can just
[1:26:31] listen it but I'll give them as I go
[1:26:33] through because they're not in total
[1:26:35] continuity but it's in continuity of
[1:26:37] thought
[1:26:39] on from in Matthew 24 6th verse. And you
[1:26:42] shall hear of wars and rumors of wars.
[1:26:46] See that you be not troubled, for all
[1:26:48] these things must come to pass, but the
[1:26:51] end is not yet.
[1:26:54] For nation shall rise against nation,
[1:26:56] and kingdom against kingdom,
[1:26:59] and there shall be famines
[1:27:02] and pestilences
[1:27:04] and earthquakes in diverse places.
[1:27:08] Didn't say specifically when.
[1:27:11] And I know that we look for an increase
[1:27:12] of earthquakes. Jesus didn't really say
[1:27:15] there'd be an increase of earthquakes as
[1:27:17] such, but there will be earthquakes in
[1:27:20] diverse places. One of the articles that
[1:27:23] uh I gathered said that uh they didn't
[1:27:28] really have record that they had that uh
[1:27:32] earthquakes of seven magnitude and
[1:27:34] greater were actually increasing. But
[1:27:38] they said that what they have they have
[1:27:41] sensors now set up. They used to only
[1:27:44] have a few hundred and I believe they
[1:27:45] got about 8,000
[1:27:47] sensors now around the world where
[1:27:49] they're able to record and find out the
[1:27:53] amount of uh of earthquake and
[1:27:55] earthquake activity is taking place. And
[1:27:58] so consequently, he said we have many
[1:28:00] more recorded because we have more
[1:28:03] systems whereby we can uh report what is
[1:28:08] taking place. But now the other thing is
[1:28:12] it's not just what takes place but it's
[1:28:16] where it takes place.
[1:28:20] &gt;&gt; You see I don't think that Katrina
[1:28:25] was an accident.
[1:28:28] &gt;&gt; Neither was it just a hurricane.
[1:28:31] &gt;&gt; But it happens to be probably one of the
[1:28:35] vilest of cities
[1:28:37] &gt;&gt; in America. one of the most perverted of
[1:28:40] cities.
[1:28:42] &gt;&gt; They go with their mira
[1:28:44] &gt;&gt; which is hell on earth.
[1:28:47] &gt;&gt; This congregation ought to say amen.
[1:28:51] &gt;&gt; God sees that.
[1:28:55] &gt;&gt; God looks upon that.
[1:28:58] God doesn't hate people. He hates the
[1:29:01] sin,
[1:29:03] &gt;&gt; the system.
[1:29:04] God doesn't hate denominational
[1:29:07] denominational people.
[1:29:09] &gt;&gt; He does hate the system
[1:29:11] &gt;&gt; because it's anti-word.
[1:29:13] &gt;&gt; It's antirist.
[1:29:17] &gt;&gt; And that's very important that we are
[1:29:19] able to establish that. And we speak
[1:29:22] about people with their twisted and
[1:29:23] perverted and and and they give
[1:29:25] themselves to it. As they give
[1:29:27] themselves to it in unbelief, they will
[1:29:30] certainly perish with it. They will
[1:29:32] perish with the sin
[1:29:35] &gt;&gt; and the sinful if they give themselves
[1:29:37] to it. Anybody will, anyone here, anyone
[1:29:40] under the sound of my voice. If you give
[1:29:42] yourself to the world, give yourself to
[1:29:44] sin, you'll be destroyed with the world.
[1:29:47] That's all there is. There is no other
[1:29:49] solution. And so now we find not just a
[1:29:52] hurricane, not just a incredible
[1:29:55] disaster, but in a specific place
[1:29:58] &gt;&gt; that is a uh it it is just a fostering
[1:30:03] and festering cesspool
[1:30:07] of sin.
[1:30:09] &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham says if God doesn't
[1:30:11] just judge America, he'll have to raise
[1:30:14] up Sodom and Gomorrah and apologize. But
[1:30:17] we get we we get it every day. We see it
[1:30:20] every day. It's on the street. It's in
[1:30:23] the restaurant. It's in the airplane.
[1:30:25] It's everywhere. And and Satan's Satan's
[1:30:29] idea is to get you cooled off to accept
[1:30:32] it. And it's in the fashion industry.
[1:30:34] It's in the clothes that you men buy.
[1:30:36] It's in the clothes you women buy.
[1:30:39] There's the most perverted and the most
[1:30:41] twisted of of minds that design those
[1:30:44] things. run away from it.
[1:30:47] &gt;&gt; Go the other direction.
[1:30:49] &gt;&gt; We don't have to be changed. We don't
[1:30:51] have to what you see on Vanity Fair or
[1:30:54] see in some magazine. Go the other
[1:30:56] direction. You see some Hollywood star
[1:30:58] dressed that way. Dressed opposite.
[1:31:01] &gt;&gt; Absolutely. There skin tight clothes
[1:31:04] showing every every part of a man's body
[1:31:07] or a woman's body. And it's a woman's
[1:31:09] body that Satan used in the first place.
[1:31:12] I say you women want to keep your bodies
[1:31:14] sacred and keep them covered and keep it
[1:31:17] holy. And if you go the way of the
[1:31:19] world, there's no there's no other uh uh
[1:31:22] there's no other solution. There's no
[1:31:24] other conclusion we can come to than
[1:31:27] this one conclusion that you're you're
[1:31:29] speaking you're speaking by your action
[1:31:33] another gospel that's not the gospel of
[1:31:36] Jesus Christ because actions speak
[1:31:38] louder than words. And in our actions,
[1:31:41] we're preaching a gospel. And we must
[1:31:44] not preach the gospel of Hollywood. We
[1:31:46] must not preach the gospel of the
[1:31:48] fashion industry. We must not preach the
[1:31:51] gospel of the sports world. We must not
[1:31:53] preach the gospel. If these young men
[1:31:56] are going along with their spiked hair
[1:31:57] and all the rest of it, go the other
[1:31:59] direction.
[1:32:01] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:32:02] &gt;&gt; You say, "I'm oldfashioned." You'll find
[1:32:04] on the other side. It's the oldfashioned
[1:32:07] way. That's the gospel way. Hallelujah.
[1:32:16] &gt;&gt; I don't care what what becomes popular
[1:32:19] in the world.
[1:32:21] &gt;&gt; We're not interested in their
[1:32:22] popularity. We're not interested in the
[1:32:24] direction they're going. We're not
[1:32:25] interested in their music. We're not
[1:32:27] interested in what they what they're
[1:32:29] entertained with. We're not interested
[1:32:31] in their in their videos and their
[1:32:32] movies and all. We're not interested in
[1:32:34] it. We got another city. We got another
[1:32:37] land. We got a place of holiness.
[1:32:40] Hallelujah. And we're planning on going
[1:32:42] there.
[1:32:45] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:32:46] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:32:48] &gt;&gt; And it says pestilences.
[1:32:51] They can say all they want about the
[1:32:53] AIDS and all the most popular people and
[1:32:56] great movie stars and everything else
[1:32:59] all getting behind the, you know, trying
[1:33:02] to recover from AIDS. They know where it
[1:33:05] started. Right.
[1:33:07] &gt;&gt; They know it's a perverted life that
[1:33:08] brought it.
[1:33:10] &gt;&gt; And it's wiping out entire generations.
[1:33:13] &gt;&gt; They said in in countries of Africa,
[1:33:16] it's going to wipe out an entire
[1:33:18] generation of men and women.
[1:33:22] &gt;&gt; A whole gap of a generation is gone.
[1:33:25] Gone.
[1:33:26] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:33:28] And to think that this perverted
[1:33:30] community
[1:33:32] wants to lay out the responsibility
[1:33:35] upon you upon every uh even uh Christian
[1:33:40] people of the Christian community to
[1:33:43] support the result of their sin and the
[1:33:45] consequence. And so they say a lot of
[1:33:47] innocent people are caught in it.
[1:33:49] Innocent babies are caught in it.
[1:33:50] Exactly. Right.
[1:33:52] &gt;&gt; But God's going to hold them responsible
[1:33:54] for everyone.
[1:33:56] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[1:33:57] &gt;&gt; And furthermore, the beds that are
[1:34:00] occupied by people who have AIDS who
[1:34:02] say, "Well, should they not have a a
[1:34:04] hospital bed, not over and above your
[1:34:07] sick child
[1:34:10] &gt;&gt; or this godly man or woman?"
[1:34:12] &gt;&gt; Not over and above them to lay in a bed
[1:34:15] for three months and and and you can't
[1:34:18] find a bed.
[1:34:20] &gt;&gt; I went last night to visit
[1:34:23] visit my aunt
[1:34:26] And then and they have these hospital
[1:34:28] rooms now, which I think is such a
[1:34:30] disgrace and an embarrassment for these
[1:34:33] countries that are as wealthy as
[1:34:35] America, Canada, and the Western world.
[1:34:38] And they they now they make these rooms
[1:34:40] unisex. There's my aunt, and behind the
[1:34:43] curtains a a man, and across the aisle
[1:34:47] is a Chinese woman. And when I went
[1:34:51] there f uh Friday, there was the three
[1:34:55] of them. And that's only three beds in
[1:34:57] the room. And I go there yesterday. And
[1:35:01] just as I go in, there's a a little
[1:35:04] frame with a curtain cloth on it and it
[1:35:07] it goes out about 2 feet and then on a
[1:35:10] angle for about 68 ft that way. And the
[1:35:13] bathroom door is right behind it.
[1:35:16] as I as I go in then great big strong
[1:35:20] young man probably all of 240 250 lb
[1:35:24] young man
[1:35:27] just a picture of strength 25 years old
[1:35:31] in there for heart surgery
[1:35:34] and my aunt says he he just came in and
[1:35:37] that was his room behind those two
[1:35:39] cloths
[1:35:41] to find space for him no beds
[1:35:44] you
[1:35:46] I'm not laying the blame to anybody, but
[1:35:49] the system isn't working.
[1:35:54] &gt;&gt; We're smart, intelligent, got
[1:35:57] universities, we're further down the
[1:35:59] road, got more money, billions of
[1:36:02] dollars in oil, and can't find a bed for
[1:36:05] a young man that's sick.
[1:36:07] &gt;&gt; Something's wrong with the system,
[1:36:09] folks.
[1:36:10] &gt;&gt; I'm not here for politics. I'm here to
[1:36:12] tell you that the politics has failed.
[1:36:15] &gt;&gt; Democracy has failed.
[1:36:20] &gt;&gt; There's only one hope.
[1:36:23] &gt;&gt; That's for Christ himself
[1:36:25] &gt;&gt; to establish his kingdom once again. And
[1:36:27] he's already establishing it in the
[1:36:29] hearts of men and women.
[1:36:31] &gt;&gt; That thing that's in you is the kingdom
[1:36:33] that's coming into place.
[1:36:37] &gt;&gt; Amen. says, "There'll be pestilences,
[1:36:40] and pestilences are plagues."
[1:36:42] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:36:50] &gt;&gt; Here's the overview of the global AIDS
[1:36:52] epidemi epidemic.
[1:36:56] It's very brief. This is the overview.
[1:37:00] You can go on a United Nations or go on
[1:37:02] all these other research official
[1:37:05] places. I won't bore you with it. An
[1:37:08] estimated
[1:37:10] 38.6 million
[1:37:13] people worldwide
[1:37:15] were living with AIDS in 205.
[1:37:19] An estimated 4.1 million
[1:37:22] became newly infected with HIV and
[1:37:25] estimated 2.8 million
[1:37:28] lost their lives. It's almost three
[1:37:31] million people lost their lives in one
[1:37:35] year, 12 months.
[1:37:40] and greater population than this entire
[1:37:43] nation of Canada is infected with AIDS.
[1:37:47] There's places in Africa where it has
[1:37:50] reached 50%.
[1:37:53] Are there innocents?
[1:37:56] Yes, of course there are.
[1:38:00] And this is something that we may not
[1:38:02] understand. And I'm just praying that
[1:38:03] God will give me leadership here.
[1:38:06] Brother Brandham spoke about compassion.
[1:38:10] He said you don't know what compassion
[1:38:12] is.
[1:38:14] People don't know what compassion is.
[1:38:18] He said compassion is when Jesus went to
[1:38:21] the pool of Bethesda Beth Bethesda
[1:38:25] &gt;&gt; and he goes to the pool and the Bible
[1:38:28] says there's a great multitude of people
[1:38:31] that are laying there waiting for the
[1:38:34] stirring of the waters.
[1:38:37] And brother Brandham goes into
[1:38:38] description because he's one who's
[1:38:41] chosen. He's the one who's chosen to
[1:38:44] reveal the son of man. and he sees them
[1:38:46] come by. We don't have children. I have
[1:38:50] seen children with the water heads and
[1:38:52] massive heads. We don't have it much
[1:38:55] today. It's very unusual. But he uses
[1:38:58] that term several times. So you young
[1:39:00] people don't know. You can see a little
[1:39:02] child about this size, maybe three, four
[1:39:04] years old with a massive head like that.
[1:39:08] Grotesque.
[1:39:10] And that is a water head. Brother
[1:39:12] Brandham said, "Jesus walks at the pool
[1:39:16] and he steps by the mother holding that
[1:39:20] little child
[1:39:23] and crying out, "Oh, someone help me
[1:39:27] and a blind man and he steps over him.
[1:39:31] Somebody help me. Help me. Can somebody
[1:39:33] lead me?" and he steps over him. And he
[1:39:37] steps by the sick and the afflicted
[1:39:40] and comes to a man who's had an
[1:39:42] infirmity.
[1:39:43] He's not even sick,
[1:39:45] &gt;&gt; but he's had an infirmity and he can't
[1:39:47] make it to the pool. He's been there 38
[1:39:50] years.
[1:39:52] &gt;&gt; And Jesus heals him,
[1:39:54] &gt;&gt; bypassing all others. And brother
[1:39:57] Brandham said, "That's compassion."
[1:39:59] He said, "Compassion is doing the word
[1:40:02] of God." And that's what the father
[1:40:04] showed him. That's compassion. That goes
[1:40:07] beyond your understanding. We're not
[1:40:10] here to move within the realm of your
[1:40:13] understanding or my understanding or
[1:40:15] what I think compassion is or what I
[1:40:17] think love is or what I think judgment
[1:40:20] is.
[1:40:24] &gt;&gt; Jesus said the words of Jesus.
[1:40:28] He said many many widows
[1:40:33] We're in Samaria.
[1:40:35] &gt;&gt; Many widows. Not only widows, but
[1:40:38] besides widows were many children and
[1:40:41] many babies
[1:40:44] &gt;&gt; and many mothers and many fathers and
[1:40:47] many a young man and many a young woman
[1:40:50] maybe working their fingers to the bone
[1:40:52] just trying to find enough to eat. He
[1:40:55] said many widows were in the land in the
[1:40:58] time of Elias but only one. Was he sent
[1:41:03] to?
[1:41:06] &gt;&gt; Hey, just a second. I'm putting this
[1:41:10] congregation, all who are listening on
[1:41:11] the internet on notice today that
[1:41:14] famine, listen to me, that famine came
[1:41:19] as a result of one man's words,
[1:41:22] &gt;&gt; and that man was Elijah himself.
[1:41:25] &gt;&gt; And he said, "There will not even be due
[1:41:27] on the ground until I call for it. Amen.
[1:41:34] &gt;&gt; Why? Because there was an Ahab.
[1:41:38] &gt;&gt; Because of the system,
[1:41:40] &gt;&gt; because of the system that was ignoring
[1:41:42] God, turning from God.
[1:41:46] &gt;&gt; I come to America, and brother, I'm
[1:41:48] going to give you quotes in a few
[1:41:49] minutes, but I'm on a bit of a roll
[1:41:50] here. I come to how the prophet Elijah
[1:41:55] once again crying out
[1:41:57] &gt;&gt; in his country to the leaders and to all
[1:42:01] who will hear.
[1:42:02] &gt;&gt; This country was established at Plymouth
[1:42:06] Rock by brethren
[1:42:08] by brethren who were fleeing persecution
[1:42:11] of Rome.
[1:42:14] They were fleeing that persecution. Came
[1:42:17] here for freedom and they fought and
[1:42:20] they struggled and they trusted in God
[1:42:24] and how they had their meetings and
[1:42:26] served God with sincerity of heart.
[1:42:28] We're here and were free and they gave
[1:42:31] thanksgiving. So they have a
[1:42:32] thanksgiving time in this country and in
[1:42:35] America. They thank God for their
[1:42:37] freedom because they had fled the Roman
[1:42:40] persecution.
[1:42:42] &gt;&gt; And they finally had a president,
[1:42:44] President uh Abraham Lincoln. And he did
[1:42:47] not speak kindly about the Jesuits and
[1:42:50] the cruelty and the murder that took
[1:42:53] place and the people that died under
[1:42:56] that system. And now just a few years
[1:42:59] later, couple hundred years later, God
[1:43:01] raises up a prophet and and goes back to
[1:43:04] their beginnings
[1:43:07] &gt;&gt; and then tells them, "You're in the
[1:43:09] book. You're in Revelation in the 12th
[1:43:12] chapter, and you're going to join up
[1:43:14] with this beast power. You're going to
[1:43:16] change your system. You're going to
[1:43:18] become uh uh acceptable with it, and
[1:43:22] you're going to accept it. And now it
[1:43:24] comes and in your time
[1:43:27] in your day
[1:43:29] &gt;&gt; it's received just for the second time
[1:43:32] &gt;&gt; and when the prophet was speaking it the
[1:43:35] first Catholic president was in power
[1:43:39] &gt;&gt; when the prophet was here you think that
[1:43:41] and and he identifies it as an Ahab and
[1:43:44] a Jezebel
[1:43:46] &gt;&gt; you think that was just some words he
[1:43:48] wanted to put in you think it was an
[1:43:50] accident that he was here at the same
[1:43:52] time that president was there that's
[1:43:54] absolutely the or a order of God
[1:43:59] &gt;&gt; and warning the people and warning the
[1:44:01] churches and warning the businessmen and
[1:44:03] warning whoever would listen that it's
[1:44:06] the same spirit.
[1:44:08] &gt;&gt; I tell you the darkness, all the
[1:44:10] darkness is still in that system. All
[1:44:13] the cruelty is still in that system. All
[1:44:15] the blood is still under her skirts.
[1:44:21] &gt;&gt; And that was the first one.
[1:44:25] And he went also, not speaking against
[1:44:28] him now, I'm just saying he he's
[1:44:30] probably a good man, but the system he
[1:44:32] was under and went to alleviate the
[1:44:35] concerns of the Southern Baptist people
[1:44:38] and spoke of their conference so that
[1:44:41] that he would walk the fine line between
[1:44:46] state and church.
[1:44:48] &gt;&gt; That he didn't really believe in state
[1:44:49] and church,
[1:44:52] which was fine. But what happened
[1:44:54] friends is that he opened the door
[1:44:58] &gt;&gt; and they said they said that the pope
[1:45:00] which was able to visit in the garden in
[1:45:03] the back garden
[1:45:05] which it would have been they said that
[1:45:07] he's he's been received to the front
[1:45:10] door when it would have been absolutely
[1:45:12] unthinkable to even have him at the back
[1:45:14] door
[1:45:16] &gt;&gt; and he opened the door and this is now
[1:45:18] the second pope that came and visited
[1:45:21] America and have a president look in his
[1:45:24] eyes and say, "What did you see?" When
[1:45:27] you look in his eyes, he said, "I saw a
[1:45:29] god."
[1:45:32] &gt;&gt; I can tell you he had a hallucination.
[1:45:35] [Music]
[1:46:06] I had the
[1:46:09] actually had this the
[1:46:11] schedule of events
[1:46:14] and I was going to read for you and it's
[1:46:16] one of things I slipped up bringing
[1:46:21] and calling all the various religions
[1:46:23] and they were there and they came.
[1:46:28] So, how does this relate
[1:46:32] even by me bringing these things out to
[1:46:34] you? They're happening even when you
[1:46:37] aren't aware of it. They're happening
[1:46:38] while you're sleeping
[1:46:40] &gt;&gt; and this thing is slipping by and the
[1:46:42] days are going by
[1:46:44] &gt;&gt; and events are taking place. And that is
[1:46:48] why God knew well you wouldn't know
[1:46:50] about all events. You wouldn't see all
[1:46:52] the events. You don't have the capacity
[1:46:54] to retain all the events. You are you're
[1:46:57] not even made privy to it. You're not
[1:46:58] even made aware of it. It's not even
[1:47:00] announced. A lot of these things aren't
[1:47:02] announced, but it's happening. That's
[1:47:04] why the scripture says, "He that readth,
[1:47:07] &gt;&gt; let him understand."
[1:47:09] &gt;&gt; When you read it,
[1:47:10] &gt;&gt; ask today, "God, help me to understand
[1:47:13] what I need to read.
[1:47:15] &gt;&gt; And what I'm reading, help me understand
[1:47:17] it." Amen.
[1:47:22] &gt;&gt; And so the scripture says nation shall
[1:47:24] rise against nation and kingdom against
[1:47:26] kingdom and there shall be famines which
[1:47:29] there are and pestilences which there
[1:47:32] are and pestilence pestilence is an
[1:47:35] epidemic
[1:47:36] uh a highly contagious or infectious
[1:47:39] disease and I put AIDS right in that
[1:47:42] category amongst perhaps a lot of others
[1:47:45] but there's been nothing that has come
[1:47:47] come to the surface such as this one.
[1:47:50] And it has come through sex,
[1:47:52] &gt;&gt; perverted sex. Let's face it, folks.
[1:47:54] That's where it had its beginning.
[1:47:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:47:58] &gt;&gt; I had people that have official position
[1:48:01] hand me a package. And this was not for
[1:48:03] distribution to the public. Actually,
[1:48:06] nailed it right down because even those
[1:48:08] that are distributing don't want to be
[1:48:10] identified as being anti-gay or anti-
[1:48:14] something. We're not that. We're anti-
[1:48:16] sin. We're anti-perversion. We're anti-
[1:48:19] the system. And if a person wants to
[1:48:22] give themselves to it, that's up to
[1:48:23] them. So be it. And they pay a penalty
[1:48:26] for it.
[1:48:27] &gt;&gt; Say, are you going to bring a penalty?
[1:48:29] Not at all.
[1:48:30] &gt;&gt; They bring it upon themselves.
[1:48:32] &gt;&gt; Where did this thing come from?
[1:48:35] &gt;&gt; I guarantee you. I believe with all my
[1:48:37] heart there's not there's it's not in
[1:48:40] God's mind that one of his children
[1:48:42] should die from that disease. Amen.
[1:48:45] &gt;&gt; You live clean. You live holy. You live
[1:48:47] separated from the world.
[1:48:51] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:48:55] &gt;&gt; But there will be diseases. Brother
[1:48:58] Brandham said there'll be diseases that
[1:49:00] they won't be able to find a solution
[1:49:02] to. And as these various viruses mutate
[1:49:06] and become anti- uh uh they become
[1:49:10] almost resistant to any kind of
[1:49:12] antibiotics.
[1:49:14] &gt;&gt; He says there there'll be diseases
[1:49:16] that's coming that cancer just be like a
[1:49:19] toothache.
[1:49:25] &gt;&gt; You ought to sit in my place, friends.
[1:49:27] You ought to talk to the people I talk
[1:49:29] to. I'm not saying everything, but I
[1:49:32] know a whole lot more than what I'm
[1:49:33] saying. You just want to believe it. Who
[1:49:35] so readeth,
[1:49:38] &gt;&gt; let them understand.
[1:49:39] &gt;&gt; Read it in the book.
[1:49:41] &gt;&gt; There will be famines.
[1:49:42] &gt;&gt; There will be pestilences.
[1:49:45] &gt;&gt; And there will be earthquakes and it'll
[1:49:47] be in diverse places.
[1:49:53] &gt;&gt; I hope you're not weary.
[1:49:57] And it says, "And because iniquity shall
[1:49:59] abound, the love of many shall wax
[1:50:02] cold." Make sure that your love doesn't
[1:50:04] wax cold. And iniquity is a
[1:50:07] transgression of the law. Either because
[1:50:09] of ignorant be as of ignorant of it or
[1:50:12] because of violating of it. There's
[1:50:14] people that just violate it. They know
[1:50:16] it's wrong. Iniquity is contempt and
[1:50:20] violation of law. Iniquity, wickedness.
[1:50:25] Then Jesus comes and says, "But he that
[1:50:27] shall endure unto the end, the same
[1:50:30] shall be saved." You cannot read these
[1:50:32] verses without coming to the conclusion
[1:50:35] that these conditions that Jesus Christ
[1:50:38] has described and which exist amongst us
[1:50:41] today. He is saying very clearly those
[1:50:44] conditions have a tendency to wear a
[1:50:48] person down. He's talking to his own
[1:50:51] disciples. He said, "But he that shall
[1:50:53] endure to the end because these things
[1:50:56] are not easy necessarily to endure." You
[1:50:59] read about these things. You see the
[1:51:01] pictures. You see the suffering that is
[1:51:03] taking place in China and in Myanmar
[1:51:06] right now, formerly Burma. And and I've
[1:51:09] got some slides. We've got people.
[1:51:11] There's a group of believers right in
[1:51:13] the midst. And I have a great testimony
[1:51:16] this morning. I'm going to show you some
[1:51:17] pictures of of right where it happened
[1:51:19] in China. Uh but you have all of these
[1:51:22] things they have a tendency to to wear a
[1:51:25] person down because it is as though we
[1:51:27] become like shock proof. It it is though
[1:51:31] we become almost calloused. We read it
[1:51:33] in the newspaper. You hear it on the
[1:51:36] radio in your car. You hear it in the
[1:51:38] conversation and it it is it's something
[1:51:40] that has a tendency to wear on a person
[1:51:44] and make them weakened as it were. But
[1:51:47] then let him who readeth understand
[1:51:50] These things must be.
[1:51:53] &gt;&gt; They must be.
[1:51:56] &gt;&gt; It's going to touch a lot of innocent
[1:51:58] lives.
[1:52:00] Going to touch a lot of children.
[1:52:04] &gt;&gt; I'm going to just say something.
[1:52:07] Even amongst the believers, I find
[1:52:11] too many of us and we're all subject to
[1:52:15] it to being to being influenced and
[1:52:19] actually directed by our emotions.
[1:52:25] &gt;&gt; We need to understand what compassion is
[1:52:29] and we need to understand what God's
[1:52:31] word says and what he says must happen.
[1:52:36] And there's going to be innocent people.
[1:52:40] &gt;&gt; There's going to be good people affected
[1:52:42] as there was many widows.
[1:52:47] &gt;&gt; In the time of Elijah,
[1:52:50] &gt;&gt; what kind of God do you think it is that
[1:52:53] has Elijah walk past maybe many widows?
[1:52:57] As the Bible says, many widows.
[1:53:00] You know, I'm speaking seriously because
[1:53:03] it's imperative that you know God and
[1:53:06] you know the nature of God and you're
[1:53:08] not not being dictated to by a whole
[1:53:10] realm of of of what this world says is
[1:53:13] understanding and what this world says
[1:53:15] is compassion and what this world knows
[1:53:17] about love is zero
[1:53:20] &gt;&gt; just below zero.
[1:53:21] &gt;&gt; They don't know anything about love.
[1:53:23] Amen.
[1:53:25] &gt;&gt; How is it that they love and come to a a
[1:53:27] wedding and are married and and in a few
[1:53:29] months the love's gone? Where the love?
[1:53:31] It wasn't love in the first place.
[1:53:36] &gt;&gt; And these spirits are here. And it's not
[1:53:38] that they don't stop at the doors there.
[1:53:40] They're here to plague the believer.
[1:53:47] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:53:50] &gt;&gt; How far shall I go?
[1:53:52] How plain shall they get?
[1:53:55] &gt;&gt; This spirit of perversion that's in the
[1:53:57] world, it's rampant
[1:53:59] &gt;&gt; on men and women.
[1:54:01] &gt;&gt; And I say to any young woman here, any
[1:54:03] young man here, if you feel and begin to
[1:54:06] sense you're getting afflicted with a
[1:54:08] twisted, perverted spirit, you come to
[1:54:10] my office right away. Hallelujah. I got
[1:54:13] an injection for you.
[1:54:16] &gt;&gt; I got a remedy for you.
[1:54:18] &gt;&gt; And furthermore, I can tell you it's
[1:54:20] worked. Amen.
[1:54:21] &gt;&gt; I've used this hypodermic needle before
[1:54:24] called the word of God. And we've
[1:54:26] injected young men and preserved them
[1:54:28] from a twisted life.
[1:54:33] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:54:35] [Music]
[1:54:38] &gt;&gt; I've seen it.
[1:54:40] &gt;&gt; I've experienced it.
[1:54:43] &gt;&gt; I've seen him transformed and released
[1:54:46] from that horrible spirit.
[1:54:48] &gt;&gt; And it is a horrible spirit. It twists
[1:54:50] them down into the most captive, unclean
[1:54:53] lives and won't let them go.
[1:55:00] &gt;&gt; Listen to the tape from Dawson Creek.
[1:55:04] &gt;&gt; I love him.
[1:55:07] I love him. Brother Brenam singing.
[1:55:10] Brother Bren is there. and is there
[1:55:14] because
[1:55:16] he first
[1:55:19] loved me everyone so sweetly. You will
[1:55:22] not commit suicide, soldier boy.
[1:55:25] &gt;&gt; That's the devil talking to you. Deny
[1:55:27] him. Deny him and you'll go home and be
[1:55:30] a real gentleman. Be a real man.
[1:55:33] I met that boy the next day
[1:55:37] gripped with a spirit of homosexuality
[1:55:40] and had tried already to commit suicide
[1:55:43] three times. It wasn't the gospel that
[1:55:46] tried to have him commit suicide. It was
[1:55:48] a spirit driving him. A young fine
[1:55:51] soldier of the US Army trying to commit
[1:55:54] suicide because of being haunted and
[1:55:57] driven with the spirit. Listen to me,
[1:56:01] men, women, don't put up with it. That's
[1:56:04] from the kingdom of darkness.
[1:56:06] Send it back where it belongs in the
[1:56:09] name of Jesus Christ. Send it back. And
[1:56:11] if you even feel the first inkling of
[1:56:13] it, go to your parents. Go to your
[1:56:15] pastor. Go to a minister and tell him to
[1:56:18] pray with you.
[1:56:20] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:56:21] &gt;&gt; And I'll tell you something else. You
[1:56:23] can't h You can't hanky panky with it.
[1:56:25] You can't be soft with it. You have to
[1:56:27] hate it.
[1:56:29] You hate that thing because it comes to
[1:56:32] it come to do mortal conflict with you.
[1:56:34] It come to destroy you.
[1:56:36] &gt;&gt; It come to enslave you.
[1:56:42] &gt;&gt; What does this all boil down to in
[1:56:43] brother brother Brandham's terms,
[1:56:48] those you know the message, it's women
[1:56:51] who don't want to carry seed.
[1:56:56] &gt;&gt; That happens to be what lesbianism is.
[1:56:58] Yes,
[1:57:00] &gt;&gt; we'll satisfy this lustful nature woman
[1:57:04] by woman.
[1:57:08] &gt;&gt; You didn't expect that perhaps here. The
[1:57:11] country is absolutely infested with it.
[1:57:15] &gt;&gt; Agree with me?
[1:57:18] &gt;&gt; This isn't off the wall. That's
[1:57:20] &gt;&gt; right. And man, entire gay parades and
[1:57:24] cities getting behind it and mayors
[1:57:26] getting behind it and and and and kings
[1:57:30] and all kinds of people getting behind
[1:57:32] it. What is it? It's men who don't want
[1:57:34] to give a woman seed.
[1:57:38] &gt;&gt; To me, it's the ultimate insult
[1:57:42] &gt;&gt; to God, the giver of life.
[1:57:44] &gt;&gt; To put the seed where they put the seed.
[1:57:48] &gt;&gt; Terrible thing. Amen.
[1:57:50] &gt;&gt; Terrible insult to God.
[1:57:52] &gt;&gt; No wonder God said, "I'm going to
[1:57:54] destroy it.
[1:57:56] &gt;&gt; You took my life.
[1:57:58] &gt;&gt; You took my seed that I give you as a
[1:58:00] gift and put it and showed me that it
[1:58:03] threw it in my face."
[1:58:10] &gt;&gt; And then things like this go on.
[1:58:13] Do you know that Thailand
[1:58:16] and where the Indonesian
[1:58:18] terrible tsunami took place? Do you know
[1:58:21] that people fly from this country? They
[1:58:24] fly from Europe. They fly from North
[1:58:26] America to go to that part of the world
[1:58:29] for
[1:58:31] things that they're disallowed in this
[1:58:33] country. Abuse of children.
[1:58:36] Yes, sir.
[1:58:38] &gt;&gt; One of the one of the greatest spots of
[1:58:40] the world where people go for that kind
[1:58:44] of every kind of possible evil, twisted,
[1:58:49] perverted, and they bring children into
[1:58:52] that kind of slavery. Can you imagine?
[1:58:54] You have a child, if you've ever had a
[1:58:56] child, and think they'd be subjected to
[1:58:58] that kind of thing. And then they have a
[1:59:01] great giant earthquake under the earth
[1:59:03] and uh uh 330ome
[1:59:06] thousand of them destroyed innocent
[1:59:09] people destroyed. I can tell you
[1:59:11] according to God's word it's judgment.
[1:59:15] &gt;&gt; And it's not only judgment it happens in
[1:59:17] a certain place.
[1:59:19] &gt;&gt; I don't find Katrina happening in in New
[1:59:22] Orleans as an accident.
[1:59:24] &gt;&gt; I don't find a tsunami happening in
[1:59:26] Indonesia as an accident. It wasn't only
[1:59:29] happening in the earth. It happened in a
[1:59:31] certain spot.
[1:59:36] &gt;&gt; Remember that.
[1:59:37] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:59:38] &gt;&gt; The earthquake in Eliah's day or the
[1:59:40] famine in Eli in Elijah's time happened
[1:59:43] in Samaria where he was.
[1:59:45] &gt;&gt; That's where it was.
[1:59:47] &gt;&gt; And when and when Los Angeles sinks,
[1:59:49] they're going to sink for a purpose.
[1:59:52] &gt;&gt; For a purpose. And he spoke it. He said,
[1:59:55] "Because you spewed out
[1:59:57] &gt;&gt; your evil all over the earth.
[2:00:00] &gt;&gt; You've exported it. We used to import it
[2:00:02] from Paris. Now Paris gets it from us."
[2:00:09] &gt;&gt; And they're the biggest supporters, some
[2:00:10] of the biggest supporters of let let's
[2:00:13] all get together loveydovey and fix the
[2:00:16] AIDS program. Go fix it yourself.
[2:00:21] &gt;&gt; Let those who brought it on pay for it.
[2:00:25] I know I'm going to get a bad name for
[2:00:27] this.
[2:00:30] &gt;&gt; I know I'm going to be considered a some
[2:00:33] kind of a whackle for this.
[2:00:36] &gt;&gt; Don't you have compassion? Absolutely.
[2:00:37] Have compassion according to God's word.
[2:00:40] You want to have compassion, then turn
[2:00:42] from your sin. Say to all who ever hear
[2:00:45] this, turn from your sin and God will
[2:00:47] receive you.
[2:00:49] &gt;&gt; Turn from the evil and you'll have
[2:00:51] repentance and forgiveness of sin. Amen.
[2:01:00] &gt;&gt; Don't ever fool with God.
[2:01:04] &gt;&gt; I'm just going to give you a couple.
[2:01:07] I was at a big meeting
[2:01:09] down in Tennessee
[2:01:17] and a man came before me. happened to be
[2:01:20] a good friend of mine
[2:01:23] just came before me
[2:01:26] and I said, "You're troubled with a
[2:01:28] homosexual spirit, aren't you,
[2:01:34] just struck the nail on the head till he
[2:01:37] couldn't hardly speak." He said, "Yes."
[2:01:40] And I said, "And that's why you're
[2:01:41] here."
[2:01:45] I was in another city, Edmonton. In
[2:01:47] fact,
[2:01:50] great big gathering taking place. It
[2:01:52] wasn't a meeting. It was just a big
[2:01:54] gathering and they were eating and
[2:01:55] festivities were taking place and people
[2:01:58] going by, a few hundred people there and
[2:02:00] and somebody just uh young young people
[2:02:04] walking back and forth and a young man
[2:02:05] walked by me and God just spoke to me
[2:02:07] and says he's a homosexual.
[2:02:15] just a dark cloud, dark presence.
[2:02:19] I didn't say anything. I waited
[2:02:22] some time later,
[2:02:24] maybe one or two years later,
[2:02:28] I was in a meeting
[2:02:31] and he was sitting in the pew and it
[2:02:34] happened to be down here.
[2:02:36] He was attending a service
[2:02:41] and just about everybody had gone out
[2:02:44] and he remained sitting there and I came
[2:02:48] I had left the service I came back I saw
[2:02:50] him sitting there
[2:02:52] I came down I sat beside him
[2:02:57] I said I want to tell you something that
[2:02:58] happened to me up in Edmonton
[2:03:03] there was some festivity taking place it
[2:03:05] was like a banquet was taking place
[2:03:08] and people and all walking by and
[2:03:11] talking and laughing. I said, "You
[2:03:13] walked by
[2:03:15] and God spoke to me and said, you're
[2:03:17] homosexual."
[2:03:19] He plunged his head down between his
[2:03:21] legs. He says, "I hate it. I hate it. I
[2:03:25] hate it."
[2:03:28] What do you think that does to a
[2:03:29] minister's heart?
[2:03:33] What do you think it does to his heart?
[2:03:36] I loved him and I hate that spirit,
[2:03:40] &gt;&gt; that demon spirit
[2:03:42] &gt;&gt; that wants to put its roots down. Hang
[2:03:45] on to him and say you're mine. I'm going
[2:03:48] to dictate to you. I'm going to tell you
[2:03:50] who your friends are. I'm going to tell
[2:03:51] you who your associates are. I'm going
[2:03:53] to deprive you of a decent marriage. I'm
[2:03:55] going to deprive you of the things of
[2:03:57] life. You're going to serve me. What do
[2:04:00] you think goes to my heart? Cast him out
[2:04:04] &gt;&gt; in the name of Jesus Christ
[2:04:06] &gt;&gt; and give him a direction for his life
[2:04:09] and say those things that even you start
[2:04:11] feeling a urge to have, you know, maybe
[2:04:13] some strong perfume and you want to look
[2:04:15] at a certain magazine of deny him.
[2:04:18] &gt;&gt; Do what the prophet said, deny him. Deny
[2:04:20] him. Deny him. Go the other way.
[2:04:24] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen?
[2:04:25] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:04:27] Listen, my friends, this may seem sound
[2:04:29] harsh, but this is a delivering message.
[2:04:34] &gt;&gt; All kinds of people want to complain
[2:04:35] upon society and where we're at, but you
[2:04:38] got to do something in the first place.
[2:04:40] Do something yourself.
[2:04:42] &gt;&gt; At your own place, within your own realm
[2:04:44] of influence.
[2:04:49] &gt;&gt; God's true.
[2:04:50] &gt;&gt; I feel like singing God's true.
[2:04:53] &gt;&gt; The devil's a liar.
[2:04:57] Listen friends, if you love the world or
[2:05:00] the things of the world,
[2:05:02] &gt;&gt; the love of the father's not in you.
[2:05:06] &gt;&gt; That's just that simple.
[2:05:08] &gt;&gt; The love of the father is not in you if
[2:05:10] we love the world. And we want to, you
[2:05:12] know, just kind of pamper. We don't want
[2:05:14] to pamper those things.
[2:05:16] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:05:18] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:05:23] I thought of the quality
[2:05:26] of endurance
[2:05:28] and they that endures. Jesus said these
[2:05:31] things because they that endure to the
[2:05:34] end. He was simply stating there will be
[2:05:37] those that will deserve that will
[2:05:40] preserve be preserved and endure to the
[2:05:42] end.
[2:05:43] &gt;&gt; There are those.
[2:05:45] He said listen anointed ones look at the
[2:05:48] last days. It'll be so close it'll
[2:05:51] deceive the very elected if possible.
[2:05:54] The reason why the elected can't be
[2:05:56] deceived. You know why? The reason why
[2:05:59] the elected can't be deceived. Do you
[2:06:01] want to know why? It's because they are
[2:06:04] the word.
[2:06:07] &gt;&gt; They are the word and they can't be
[2:06:09] deceived. Christ could not be deceived.
[2:06:13] &gt;&gt; Adam was not deceived. The first Adam
[2:06:15] was not deceived. The second Adam was
[2:06:17] not deceived. Eve was deceived. The
[2:06:20] church has been deceived. But in the end
[2:06:22] time, this second Adam takes a wife to
[2:06:25] himself and she becomes him.
[2:06:28] &gt;&gt; She becomes what he is. She becomes bone
[2:06:31] of his bone, flesh of his flesh, spirit
[2:06:34] of his spirit and word of his word. And
[2:06:37] because she's word, she can't be
[2:06:39] deceived.
[2:06:42] &gt;&gt; That's why we preach what we're
[2:06:43] preaching. The bride of Jesus Christ
[2:06:46] can't be deceived. I'm talking about the
[2:06:48] real bride. The church is deceived.
[2:06:53] &gt;&gt; And he goes on to say it's because they
[2:06:55] are the word. And just like the life
[2:06:57] that's in the root, it can't deny
[2:06:59] itself. It is the word and the season of
[2:07:02] the word.
[2:07:04] &gt;&gt; The reason he said the elect, the reason
[2:07:07] the elected, Jesus said, won't be
[2:07:08] deceived because they are the word. He
[2:07:10] repeats it again. They can't be nothing
[2:07:12] else.
[2:07:13] &gt;&gt; They are the word.
[2:07:15] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:07:15] &gt;&gt; You say amen to that. Yeah.
[2:07:17] &gt;&gt; They can't be anything else.
[2:07:19] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen to that?
[2:07:21] &gt;&gt; They can't hear nothing else.
[2:07:24] &gt;&gt; They don't know nothing else.
[2:07:26] &gt;&gt; I like all of those.
[2:07:28] &gt;&gt; They can't be deceived. Why can't you be
[2:07:30] deceived? Because you're the word.
[2:07:32] &gt;&gt; You must say, "I am the word."
[2:07:34] &gt;&gt; And when any of those feelings come or
[2:07:36] anything, Satan, he doesn't care who he
[2:07:38] tempts or who he becomes. You need to
[2:07:41] say as soon as that you feel that
[2:07:42] haunting spirit, I am the word. Put him
[2:07:45] on notice. You can't deceive me. I've
[2:07:48] already identified you. You dark evil
[2:07:51] spirit. Depart from me.
[2:07:55] &gt;&gt; And he'll come in such a nice way, such
[2:07:57] an intense, such a interesting way as he
[2:08:00] did to Eve, but you deny him.
[2:08:06] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:08:08] &gt;&gt; And you will hear of wars and rumors of
[2:08:10] wars.
[2:08:12] Okay, just give me a little bit of time
[2:08:14] and I'm going to close. I don't want to
[2:08:15] wear you out, but there's only one
[2:08:17] service today.
[2:08:18] &gt;&gt; And nation will rise against nation,
[2:08:20] kingdom against kingdom, there'll be
[2:08:21] famines, pestilences, and these are the
[2:08:24] beginning of sorrows. And then, because
[2:08:26] of iniquity, it shall abound. The love
[2:08:27] of many shall wax cold, and then they
[2:08:30] shall deliver you up to be afflicted,
[2:08:31] and shall kill you, and shall be hated
[2:08:33] of all nations for my name's sake. And
[2:08:36] then shall many be offended, and shall
[2:08:38] betray one another, and shall hate one
[2:08:40] another, and many false prophets shall
[2:08:42] rise and deceive many. People say
[2:08:45] William Brandham, they try to identify
[2:08:47] it. Many don't say he's a false prophet,
[2:08:49] but they want to say that we're false,
[2:08:51] which is saying the same thing.
[2:08:57] &gt;&gt; I'm prepared to wait out
[2:08:59] and see who's false.
[2:09:03] &gt;&gt; Faith can afford to wait.
[2:09:06] &gt;&gt; I'm prepared to wait. Are you prepared
[2:09:07] to wait? Amen.
[2:09:11] &gt;&gt; I go back 35 years right here in this
[2:09:14] same town and I could write you a big
[2:09:17] volume of book of those that have lived
[2:09:20] and served Christ. I thought so many uh
[2:09:23] some of the brothers working at the camp
[2:09:25] there. Brother Joseph, brother James
[2:09:27] both said and another brother said, "We
[2:09:29] were children in this camp. We were
[2:09:32] children in this camp. Did my heart
[2:09:34] good." Here they're children in the
[2:09:35] camp. Now they're fathers themselves and
[2:09:37] building so some other children can go.
[2:09:42] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:09:43] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:09:44] &gt;&gt; And I've seen it remain steadfast.
[2:09:47] &gt;&gt; This the same gospel as brother Brandham
[2:09:49] could say. It's the same thing I
[2:09:50] believed when I was a young man. Same
[2:09:52] gospel. It's the same gospel. We're just
[2:09:55] further down the road. It's the same
[2:09:57] gospel. The same character.
[2:10:00] &gt;&gt; You have to help me now.
[2:10:03] &gt;&gt; Okay. Now,
[2:10:06] now we're just coming to where I want to
[2:10:07] preach.
[2:10:12] &gt;&gt; Uh,
[2:10:14] the first coming, I'm going to come come
[2:10:16] back to some of these things I've just
[2:10:17] spoke on, but the first coming
[2:10:20] of Christ, say it this way, please, for
[2:10:23] me,
[2:10:25] just prick your conscience and your mind
[2:10:27] now. The first coming of God's presence.
[2:10:32] So I'll I'll just move from the word
[2:10:34] coming for a moment because it uses
[2:10:36] presence. You go to the go to the diglot
[2:10:38] you'll see the word presence because the
[2:10:40] presence and the coming and the face
[2:10:43] seeing him face to face all those are in
[2:10:45] in one line that has to do with his
[2:10:47] coming.
[2:10:50] So the first coming of God's presence to
[2:10:53] the earth. Now could you please see for
[2:10:56] a moment? Can you see uh the great
[2:10:58] eternal being that covers all time and
[2:11:00] space? And now he's focusing and coming
[2:11:03] down to a vortex,
[2:11:05] an incredible intensity.
[2:11:08] This God
[2:11:11] in flesh.
[2:11:13] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[2:11:15] This creator,
[2:11:17] creative power in flesh,
[2:11:22] walking in a body exactly the same as
[2:11:26] yours.
[2:11:29] Such a concentration
[2:11:31] until they could say the whole godhead
[2:11:34] bodily was in the person of Jesus
[2:11:36] Christ. And as such, when he opened his
[2:11:40] mouth,
[2:11:42] not a myth, not some little story, but
[2:11:44] he opened his mouth, spoke to the waves,
[2:11:48] &gt;&gt; and they obeyed and still,
[2:11:53] &gt;&gt; spoke to the wind.
[2:11:55] Imagine one man speaking to the wind and
[2:12:00] the wind subsides.
[2:12:03] One man
[2:12:05] crying at the tomb of Lazarus. And in
[2:12:08] there a man stinkketh already. Four days
[2:12:13] in that heat closed up in that tomb. One
[2:12:16] man, Lazarus, come forth.
[2:12:21] &gt;&gt; After he had cried,
[2:12:23] after he wept, not for Lazarus's death,
[2:12:26] he wept for their unbelief,
[2:12:28] &gt;&gt; not knowing what was there. What? Not
[2:12:30] knowing what was right with them. Maybe
[2:12:32] they were touching them. Maybe they were
[2:12:33] shouldertosh shoulder.
[2:12:37] &gt;&gt; I'm not just preaching. That's exactly
[2:12:39] where you stand.
[2:12:44] &gt;&gt; If we could believe and have a united
[2:12:46] faith, I'll say what brother Brandham
[2:12:48] said. There wouldn't be a sick person
[2:12:49] here in the next five minutes.
[2:12:52] &gt;&gt; If we realize who is here and why he's
[2:12:54] here and who spoke these words and what
[2:12:56] kind of a message that you have come to
[2:12:58] believe, I tell you what, it's unworthy.
[2:13:00] If it if it's beyond this planet,
[2:13:05] &gt;&gt; it wouldn't be a sick person here.
[2:13:07] &gt;&gt; Choose to believe in the name of Jesus
[2:13:10] Christ. Choose to believe.
[2:13:13] &gt;&gt; All things are possible to them that
[2:13:14] believe.
[2:13:17] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:13:21] &gt;&gt; 33 years
[2:13:23] of that concentrated presence
[2:13:27] on earth. 33 years. But in the 33 years
[2:13:30] he grew up, he was the age of these boys
[2:13:32] here, the age of these young men here.
[2:13:34] Then he got the age of the older. He
[2:13:37] became 30 years old. And now then he
[2:13:39] stepped onto the scene and went down to
[2:13:41] the river and was baptized of John.
[2:13:45] And the voice speaking out, this is my
[2:13:47] beloved son in whom I'm well pleased.
[2:13:50] this concentration and then three three
[2:13:53] and a half years of incredibly intense
[2:13:57] ministry, hardly having time to eat and
[2:13:59] sleep many times and then ending on a
[2:14:02] cross.
[2:14:05] God followed this same pattern in the
[2:14:07] last days
[2:14:10] and a messenger that he sent and a
[2:14:12] prophet that he raised up that would
[2:14:14] minister for 33 years the same length as
[2:14:16] the life of Jesus Christ.
[2:14:19] only now this time it's not just a
[2:14:21] Palestine it must go to the world so it
[2:14:25] can't be just three and a half years but
[2:14:26] it's the same length of God's
[2:14:28] concentration of his presence on earth
[2:14:32] &gt;&gt; hear me now
[2:14:33] &gt;&gt; and get the get the thought now brother
[2:14:36] Brandham is not just a messenger not
[2:14:38] just a prophet this was a concentration
[2:14:40] &gt;&gt; of God's presence
[2:14:42] &gt;&gt; on earth
[2:14:44] &gt;&gt; because this is part and parcel of his
[2:14:48] second coming.
[2:14:50] &gt;&gt; He has to have this to introduce it. And
[2:14:54] so comes the same ministry
[2:14:58] &gt;&gt; when the dead are there and the mother
[2:15:01] with a stiff baby in her been having it
[2:15:03] for 12 hours. the Mexican woman and
[2:15:06] coming and screaming and wouldn't let it
[2:15:08] crawling under the feet of the deacons
[2:15:10] and the ushers and whatever more and
[2:15:12] holding and been standing in the rain
[2:15:14] for hours and I got that child under a
[2:15:17] blanket and it warms under the prophet's
[2:15:19] hands and came to life and screamed out
[2:15:22] because there was and and on the
[2:15:24] mountain and I was there on the mountain
[2:15:27] after four days of storm and rain and
[2:15:30] cold and I wore my rain clothes to have
[2:15:32] him stand and say this is over and we're
[2:15:35] right out of here dry.
[2:15:37] &gt;&gt; In 20 minutes, the sun is shining.
[2:15:40] Within 20 minutes, a warm wind is
[2:15:42] blowing and the clouds dispense and
[2:15:44] disperse and we ran. I was I was closer
[2:15:47] to the willows than I am to those doors.
[2:15:49] And by the time I would have hit those
[2:15:51] willows, I'd have been soaked to my
[2:15:52] skin. By the time we rode out, which is
[2:15:55] my maybe a half an hour later, those
[2:15:57] bushes were already dry, the leaves were
[2:16:00] dry, and the wind came and blew
[2:16:02] everything. Hear the at the voice of a
[2:16:04] man.
[2:16:07] &gt;&gt; Storm, go back.
[2:16:10] &gt;&gt; Fisher, you have your life.
[2:16:13] &gt;&gt; Possum
[2:16:14] &gt;&gt; has its life. Go back to your babies.
[2:16:18] &gt;&gt; What is it? It's a creator.
[2:16:21] &gt;&gt; Speaking through an adopted son.
[2:16:24] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. In our time. So we could
[2:16:27] take those words that would utter from
[2:16:29] that mouth also not having to do with
[2:16:31] things of the past, but even for this
[2:16:33] time there will be an earthquake.
[2:16:37] &gt;&gt; Don't anybody here ever dare to call
[2:16:40] upon him when you hear or if you shall
[2:16:43] hear that Los Angeles in that area is
[2:16:46] shaking and heaving. I don't expect
[2:16:48] it'll sink in just moments of time. I
[2:16:51] expect it will slide as he said into the
[2:16:54] ocean. Amen.
[2:16:55] &gt;&gt; It will belch up with its great
[2:16:58] upheavalss from underneath and that
[2:17:00] bench that holds the city of Los Angeles
[2:17:04] is going to give way and it's going to
[2:17:06] sink into the ocean. I will see I see
[2:17:09] that there'll be perhaps great
[2:17:10] fishissurers of ocean water start to
[2:17:13] come in. Ambulances won't be able to go.
[2:17:16] Air airplanes won't be able to fly off
[2:17:18] of the the airport at Lax Air Force at
[2:17:21] the air base rather. the trains, uh,
[2:17:24] subways, nothing else will be able to
[2:17:25] move for the fissurers and the sinking
[2:17:27] and the and the disparity and the
[2:17:30] diverse uh levels of the ground. That's
[2:17:33] it may even take a few days. How many
[2:17:35] people are you going to haul out of a
[2:17:36] city of maybe 10 million,
[2:17:38] &gt;&gt; right?
[2:17:40] &gt;&gt; So, how does that happen? You know how
[2:17:43] it happens? Because the creator
[2:17:47] &gt;&gt; who made the belching of the earth
[2:17:50] for those that wouldn't believe in a
[2:17:51] hell is sit on a whole planet of it.
[2:17:55] &gt;&gt; He said it'll belch forth. Chile is
[2:17:58] belching forth where brother Louise is.
[2:18:01] Send us pictures of dust caked all over
[2:18:03] their cars. Everybody wearing masks
[2:18:08] &gt;&gt; because one man speaks. Amen.
[2:18:11] &gt;&gt; This may be over the edge, but I'm
[2:18:13] satisfied myself.
[2:18:15] &gt;&gt; This earthquake, and I'm going to show
[2:18:17] you pictures of two brothers that were
[2:18:20] put in prison last year.
[2:18:23] &gt;&gt; We prayed for them right here. They were
[2:18:25] put in prison in China for this message.
[2:18:31] &gt;&gt; And a few months later,
[2:18:34] it's a enormous earthquake
[2:18:37] and buildings shook.
[2:18:40] I'll read for you what came yesterday.
[2:18:46] Many believers have asked about the
[2:18:48] saints in China after the destructive
[2:18:50] earthquake happened four days ago.
[2:18:54] Brother Murphy
[2:18:56] phone brother Ivan and Sister Asenath.
[2:18:59] Where's Brother Ivan and Sister Asenth?
[2:19:08] Maybe they're maybe they're up in the
[2:19:11] room there with brother Murphy.
[2:19:14] Sister Asenth's parents live in this
[2:19:16] city
[2:19:18] and there's about 30 believers there.
[2:19:21] It's about
[2:19:24] maybe 200 kilome or 200 miles from the
[2:19:27] actual epicenter right at the epicenter
[2:19:30] of the earthquake.
[2:19:33] and her parents live in Deao
[2:19:37] Sashwan uh province about 390 kilometers
[2:19:41] for those of you that in kilometers
[2:19:42] eastward of the epicenter there's about
[2:19:45] 30 saints in the city the earthquake
[2:19:48] happened at 2:30 in the afternoon on
[2:19:51] Monday their time most of the believers
[2:19:54] either work or or at home two of the
[2:19:58] sisters were visiting each other and
[2:20:00] cooking together
[2:20:03] while one of the sister's husbands was
[2:20:05] downstairs.
[2:20:07] They lived in a very old 8 to 10 floor
[2:20:10] apartment. And when the quake struck,
[2:20:13] the building was fiercely rocking. Then
[2:20:16] the sisters immediately know that it's
[2:20:18] an earthquake. So they kneel down right
[2:20:21] away and pray, but not with fear, only
[2:20:25] praising the Lord. They even thought
[2:20:28] that the rapture is coming. And after
[2:20:30] they prayed, they felt great peace in
[2:20:33] their heart. So they they just stand up
[2:20:36] and keep making their dumplings.
[2:20:39] This time the sister's husband ran up
[2:20:42] when he saw them making their dumplings
[2:20:44] because he's not a Christian. He's not a
[2:20:46] believer. And he saw the sisters
[2:20:48] standing there chatting, fellowshipping,
[2:20:52] and he was more stunned by their
[2:20:54] reaction than he was by the earthquake.
[2:20:57] And he asked them with stammering lips,
[2:20:59] "Why? Why? Why? Oh, oh, shall we run?"
[2:21:03] Because he saw everybody out in the
[2:21:05] buildings and the streets were packed
[2:21:07] with frightened people and screaming.
[2:21:10] And the sisters just assured the husband
[2:21:12] that everything was fine. Actually, not
[2:21:15] one item in their house was damaged. Not
[2:21:18] even a glass.
[2:21:20] [Music]
[2:21:22] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:21:25] You talk about a preserve preservation.
[2:21:31] They then contacted with other believers
[2:21:33] and all of them are fine. Some of the
[2:21:36] believers were praying at that time. And
[2:21:38] when the quake struck, they just filled
[2:21:40] with joy because they all thought this
[2:21:43] is the time that the Lord is coming to
[2:21:45] take them home. They even felt a little
[2:21:47] bit sad when this was not actually
[2:21:49] happened.
[2:21:51] No one was injured. No one had any fear.
[2:21:54] One sister said when she feel the
[2:21:56] shaking and the only thing that came to
[2:21:59] her mind is Lord am I ready? Then she
[2:22:02] knelt down and crying to the Lord to
[2:22:04] search her heart. God has a way to bring
[2:22:07] people down on their knees but for good.
[2:22:11] And after this earthquake there are
[2:22:13] several aftershocks that are also
[2:22:15] strong. Two measured six and five
[2:22:20] measured five. That's seven more
[2:22:22] earthquakes.
[2:22:24] But none of them affect this city of
[2:22:26] Dao. It is such a contrast between the
[2:22:29] believers and the world. The peace and
[2:22:31] the calmness showed in the believers,
[2:22:34] men and women, greatly impacted their
[2:22:37] loved ones who are not believers. The
[2:22:40] one that disrespect and scorn their
[2:22:42] belief now turns silent and even asks
[2:22:45] their wife or husband, "Shall we run or
[2:22:47] not?" asking them, "Should we run or
[2:22:50] don't run?" When the aftershocks
[2:22:53] happened, they dare not to make any
[2:22:55] move, for they knew better. Whatever
[2:22:58] their their believed wife or husband
[2:23:01] said is come from above, the heavenly
[2:23:04] one is more stable than the earthly.
[2:23:07] There are several signs forewarned the
[2:23:10] people about the earthquake, but men
[2:23:13] ignored it as usual. There are thousands
[2:23:16] upon thousands of toads and frogs ran
[2:23:20] out of their hiding place in the
[2:23:22] epicenter and crossed the road and
[2:23:25] everything three days before the quake
[2:23:27] struck.
[2:23:30] It's on YouTube apparently. You can type
[2:23:33] toad's earthquake.
[2:23:36] People reported to the television
[2:23:38] station, but the scientists said it's
[2:23:41] normal because their mating season, but
[2:23:44] the lowest creature without sin knew
[2:23:47] better than the highest creature after
[2:23:48] the fall.
[2:23:51] &gt;&gt; May this earthquake
[2:23:53] serve as a sign that warns the people
[2:23:56] that now is the shaking time. from
[2:23:58] Hebrews 12:27 said that this word yet
[2:24:02] once more signifyth the removal of those
[2:24:04] things that are shaken as of things that
[2:24:06] are made that those things which cannot
[2:24:10] be shaken may remain. Wherefore we
[2:24:12] receive a kingdom which cannot be moved.
[2:24:15] Let us have grace whereby we may serve
[2:24:18] God acceptably with reverence and godly
[2:24:20] fear for our God is a consuming fire.
[2:24:24] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. We pray that the Lord will
[2:24:27] shake open the doors, he said, for the
[2:24:29] message spreading in China.
[2:24:32] &gt;&gt; Well, our time has slipped away and I
[2:24:34] don't want to keep you, but I have so so
[2:24:37] much more and so we'll just take it uh
[2:24:39] uh at another time, but I have I have
[2:24:42] these slides. I want you to see these.
[2:24:45] And uh
[2:24:57] I have some on Israel
[2:25:02] perhaps. I will
[2:25:08] I'm just being I was just showing you
[2:25:10] about China. I will go down to uh
[2:25:16] can you give me slide 12? Is that
[2:25:18] possible? Give me slide 12.
[2:25:23] Okay, here's the area
[2:25:26] and that's pretty well self-explanatory.
[2:25:33] This quake was of such magnitude friends
[2:25:37] that it was felt here and here. So
[2:25:42] here's a dou where the believers are
[2:25:45] and it's right in this area
[2:25:48] that the quake took place.
[2:25:54] I'll show you the pictures of this
[2:25:55] brother and this brother. Those are the
[2:25:58] two that were imprisoned. I don't know
[2:26:00] which of these sisters, but isn't that a
[2:26:02] lovely group of people?
[2:26:05] There's the two brothers that were in
[2:26:08] prison. I don't know just how long they
[2:26:11] were in prison.
[2:26:16] Now recent national disasters
[2:26:19] uh 204 the Indian Ocean and the tsunami
[2:26:24] 225,000
[2:26:26] deaths
[2:26:29] 1.69 million displaced
[2:26:32] 7 billion given in aid. The hurricane
[2:26:35] Katrina 1836 deaths 76 78,000 displaced
[2:26:41] 81 billion cost of destruction
[2:26:45] in Kashmir Pakistan 79,000 deaths this
[2:26:48] is all just recent 3.3 million displaced
[2:26:53] 5 billion estimated cost of destruction
[2:26:57] 208 Burma cyclone 78,000 plus deaths and
[2:27:02] incidentally I just had to bump that up
[2:27:05] 56,000 missing, 2 to 3 million homeless.
[2:27:09] In China, 35,000 deaths. I had to bump
[2:27:12] that up also. 220,000 injured, 115
[2:27:17] billion in destruction.
[2:27:24] says, "But notice the very generation of
[2:27:28] Jews that seen the return back to
[2:27:29] Palestine, that generation would see
[2:27:31] these things happen and just the last
[2:27:34] two years she was fully become a nation
[2:27:36] without her own money." Uh, and and
[2:27:39] there she is. I just want to say I'll
[2:27:42] just shut that off just now. I just want
[2:27:45] to say we as believers with the with
[2:27:49] what the message has made known to us,
[2:27:53] we see it. And today I felt as though I
[2:27:55] was just more or less giving an
[2:27:57] overview. So we touched on the
[2:27:59] conditions that we're living with. Don't
[2:28:02] get accustomed to these conditions. We
[2:28:04] talk about some of the disasters that
[2:28:06] are taking place and these things.
[2:28:08] Perhaps you may have heard me say it
[2:28:10] before, but I'll say it this way.
[2:28:14] When I speak, I get asked frequently
[2:28:16] about what I think will take place. Uh
[2:28:19] will we be here when will we be here
[2:28:22] when uh uh the earthquake and when Los
[2:28:26] Angeles sinks?
[2:28:28] Uh I say this that if I'm here, I'm not
[2:28:32] worried. I'm not concerned the least.
[2:28:36] What happens the whole West Coast 1500
[2:28:38] miles? I'm not the least bit concerned.
[2:28:40] I'm no more concerned than Rahab was
[2:28:43] right on the wall that was to fall.
[2:28:46] &gt;&gt; I'm no more concerned than the two
[2:28:48] sisters cooking dumplings.
[2:28:52] &gt;&gt; God called us to be here.
[2:28:55] &gt;&gt; God has brought you here.
[2:28:57] &gt;&gt; God has called us for a voice. And you
[2:28:59] could be sitting right on the very
[2:29:00] epicenter of an atomic bomb and you be
[2:29:03] maybe the only one that would survive.
[2:29:05] There's nothing that can affect the
[2:29:07] believer. Do you believe that? Not a
[2:29:10] thing.
[2:29:11] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. We see what's happening with
[2:29:13] with with the Jews, with Israel. Do I
[2:29:16] understand everything? No. I don't
[2:29:18] understand all the politics and all. But
[2:29:20] the thing is, I want you to go with this
[2:29:23] in your heart today.
[2:29:25] Blessed is he that readeth. Blessed is
[2:29:28] he that readeth. Read. Understand what
[2:29:31] he reads. Not don't wait till you see
[2:29:34] something happening and say, "Oh my,
[2:29:36] isn't that wonderful? I look in the
[2:29:37] Bible. Now I can see it." No, that's not
[2:29:39] that's backwards. We believe it. And
[2:29:42] when it happens, we say, "Well, that's
[2:29:43] what I always knew was going to happen."
[2:29:45] We believe that. That's the way it's
[2:29:46] going to happen.
[2:29:48] &gt;&gt; I had I have a minister's wife,
[2:29:51] minister's wife is down in Eastern
[2:29:52] Washington, and they were withstanding
[2:29:55] the message and withstanding any of
[2:29:56] those that were receiving it. And yet,
[2:29:58] Brother Brandham to them was a great
[2:29:59] man, one of the greatest men, one of the
[2:30:01] greatest ministries. And they were
[2:30:02] withstanding believers coming and young
[2:30:04] people coming to believe. And here they
[2:30:06] had an earthquake there in in San
[2:30:08] Francisco. Who was the first one on the
[2:30:11] phone to me? That pastor's wife,
[2:30:12] &gt;&gt; right?
[2:30:13] &gt;&gt; You know what her words were? What did
[2:30:15] brother Brandham say about the
[2:30:16] earthquake in California? Did he say
[2:30:17] there's going to be three?
[2:30:20] &gt;&gt; Why don't you read it yourself and find
[2:30:21] out what he said?
[2:30:24] &gt;&gt; Why get all distressed when you when
[2:30:26] you've been withstanding something that
[2:30:28] it deep in your heart of hearts?
[2:30:31] &gt;&gt; See, why did Jesus tell the Jews? Why
[2:30:34] did Jesus tell them in Matthew 24 about
[2:30:37] the destruction coming and there won't
[2:30:39] be left one stone upon another? You
[2:30:42] wouldn't find another preacher saying,
[2:30:43] "But a prophet stands up in this day
[2:30:44] there wasn't one believer caught in that
[2:30:46] city."
[2:30:48] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:30:49] &gt;&gt; There's not going to be one believer
[2:30:51] caught
[2:30:52] &gt;&gt; in the destruction in the judgment.
[2:30:54] Judgment.
[2:30:55] &gt;&gt; We're actually in a judgment right now.
[2:30:57] The world is being judged. Amen. Amen.
[2:31:02] &gt;&gt; I'll tell you friends,
[2:31:04] right now things are rocking and
[2:31:06] reeling. The financial Who's got control
[2:31:09] of the finances?
[2:31:10] &gt;&gt; Nobody.
[2:31:12] &gt;&gt; Who's got control of inflation? Nobody.
[2:31:14] &gt;&gt; Who's got control of your fuel at the
[2:31:16] gas pumps? Nobody.
[2:31:18] &gt;&gt; Who's got control of anything? Nobody's
[2:31:21] got control. Right.
[2:31:22] &gt;&gt; And I wouldn't take anything.
[2:31:25] H how do you know that your country
[2:31:27] isn't already absolutely broke?
[2:31:32] &gt;&gt; How do you know that you're not just
[2:31:33] spending money that they're just
[2:31:34] printing?
[2:31:37] &gt;&gt; So, oh, I'm getting I'm I'm making so
[2:31:40] much. I'm making 100 grand a year. I'm
[2:31:42] making 50 grand a year. What are you
[2:31:43] making when it you go you go to the you
[2:31:46] go to the grocery store and that's gone
[2:31:48] and the rent that's gone. Yeah, you're
[2:31:51] making three times what you used to
[2:31:52] make, but still don't have anything and
[2:31:54] maybe even go behind.
[2:31:56] &gt;&gt; What is it? Who's controlling it?
[2:32:01] &gt;&gt; You see this antique right here?
[2:32:08] Come on, Paul.
[2:32:10] It's not such a joke. Antiques are
[2:32:12] supposed to be hundred and over. So, I'm
[2:32:14] just shy of that.
[2:32:17] See this?
[2:32:19] If you put your cards down, you can get
[2:32:20] anything these days.
[2:32:23] &gt;&gt; Alaska Airlines and American Express.
[2:32:28] Sad thing is they want to get paid
[2:32:33] air miles and my air card so I can go to
[2:32:37] the hospital and don't have to pay
[2:32:38] anything and all these fine things.
[2:32:44] In my short lifetime,
[2:32:47] when I was your age, I never saw one of
[2:32:49] those.
[2:32:51] &gt;&gt; I never saw one.
[2:32:53] &gt;&gt; There was no credit card.
[2:32:57] &gt;&gt; There wasn't.
[2:32:58] How the world run? Oh, it barely ran,
[2:33:01] but we ran all right. We ran just fine.
[2:33:05] Well, what'd you pay with? Ever hear
[2:33:07] money? Cash.
[2:33:10] Ever hear cash? We paid with cash. How'd
[2:33:12] you get paid? In a little envelope with
[2:33:15] a little money in it. Heavy on the
[2:33:17] little.
[2:33:21] I worked for my father-in-law. That's
[2:33:23] why it was little.
[2:33:29] And you know what? When I got to be I
[2:33:32] want to I wanted a guitar. I want to get
[2:33:34] a guitar. I would Oh, I just yearn for a
[2:33:36] guitar. There's no such thing as
[2:33:38] charging.
[2:33:40] No such a thing as credit. Buy it now
[2:33:42] and don't pay till next year. There's
[2:33:44] &gt;&gt; no such a thing. Had to pay cash for it.
[2:33:47] But you know what? It was better then.
[2:33:50] &gt;&gt; It was better then.
[2:33:51] &gt;&gt; Right.
[2:33:52] &gt;&gt; Hey,
[2:33:57] I had some change in my pocket,
[2:34:00] but it wasn't worth anything, so I
[2:34:02] didn't bring it here.
[2:34:05] But when I was your age,
[2:34:07] you know what? The quarters were silver.
[2:34:10] Pure silver. The 50 cent piece were pure
[2:34:13] silver and the dimes were pure silver. I
[2:34:16] had something.
[2:34:18] &gt;&gt; I had some substance. Now it's pot
[2:34:20] metal. I don't know. Might be made out
[2:34:22] of beer cans for all I know. Just a
[2:34:25] bunch of metal stamped out. And here you
[2:34:28] are. It's still worth 25 cents. Not
[2:34:29] worth nothing.
[2:34:31] &gt;&gt; Not worth nothing. Isn't this a joke?
[2:34:34] This is humorous, but it's true.
[2:34:36] &gt;&gt; It's absolutely true, friends. This is
[2:34:38] the world we're in. But you know what?
[2:34:40] Prophet said it would be this way.
[2:34:42] &gt;&gt; And that's the way it is. Oh, they're
[2:34:44] buying and they're selling and they're
[2:34:46] doing all kinds of trade. That's the day
[2:34:48] that we're in.
[2:34:50] &gt;&gt; You know what? I've just started
[2:34:51] preaching. Really?
[2:34:54] &gt;&gt; He starts right in the days of Noah.
[2:34:56] &gt;&gt; Says the first thing, oh, thank God I
[2:35:00] didn't forget this. Said the first thing
[2:35:03] they multiplied. Yes.
[2:35:06] &gt;&gt; As it was in the days of Noah, so will
[2:35:08] it be in the days of the son of man. He
[2:35:10] was comparing that with his day,
[2:35:12] &gt;&gt; the day of his ministry, the day of the
[2:35:14] revealing of the son of man. As it was
[2:35:16] days of Noah. So they multiplied. And
[2:35:18] you know what he goes to? Never saw it
[2:35:20] before. In all these years, never saw it
[2:35:21] before. He says there won't be enough
[2:35:24] food.
[2:35:26] &gt;&gt; Who in the congregation's been hearing
[2:35:28] about the shortage of food? Raise your
[2:35:30] hands.
[2:35:31] &gt;&gt; How many been hearing about the shortage
[2:35:32] of food?
[2:35:37] 45, 50 years ago, a prophet said, "As it
[2:35:40] was in this day,
[2:35:43] &gt;&gt; as it was in that day, there'll be a
[2:35:46] repeat in this day."
[2:35:48] &gt;&gt; And a shortage of food,
[2:35:50] limiting even Walmart, limiting how much
[2:35:53] rice you can buy.
[2:35:55] &gt;&gt; But the prophet said there'll be a
[2:35:56] shortage of food because he says the
[2:35:58] population, they won't be able to feed
[2:36:00] the population.
[2:36:01] &gt;&gt; Yes. Right.
[2:36:04] Then he goes right into the second thing
[2:36:06] was the beauty of women.
[2:36:09] Just happens to be a fact, friends.
[2:36:12] &gt;&gt; And quite frankly, I've gone so far out
[2:36:14] now. I've probably made so many enemies.
[2:36:16] I hope I've made a few friends.
[2:36:20] &gt;&gt; But it's today and you young fellas that
[2:36:22] look out and say and think you see
[2:36:24] something beautiful. Make sure it is
[2:36:26] what you see. Right.
[2:36:27] &gt;&gt; Make sure it's not Max Factor
[2:36:30] &gt;&gt; and these other people that make all
[2:36:31] kinds of body parts.
[2:36:39] &gt;&gt; Say it with such a wonderful shape. That
[2:36:42] shape might be silicon.
[2:36:46] &gt;&gt; Might as well say amen.
[2:36:48] &gt;&gt; And here we got a message that protects
[2:36:50] us from that kind of thing. He said we
[2:36:53] look at character. Beautiful character.
[2:36:56] character that comes from the word of
[2:36:57] God.
[2:37:00] That's what we see.
[2:37:02] Hallelujah.
[2:37:04] And here people all falling in love with
[2:37:06] a whole bunch of false nothing, false
[2:37:08] eyelashes and false makeup on and false
[2:37:12] body parts and false hair and extension
[2:37:14] this and extension that.
[2:37:19] &gt;&gt; Oh,
[2:37:20] &gt;&gt; you young sister just forgive me. Is old
[2:37:22] brother Ed. Remember the antique
[2:37:24] preached this morning,
[2:37:26] &gt;&gt; but it's still true.
[2:37:27] &gt;&gt; It's still God's word.
[2:37:29] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:37:32] &gt;&gt; Preach it.
[2:37:33] &gt;&gt; Make sure it's character that you see.
[2:37:36] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:37:37] &gt;&gt; A prophet said it'd be the beauty.
[2:37:39] &gt;&gt; It'd be a snare.
[2:37:42] And then from then on that led right
[2:37:45] into
[2:37:46] led right into
[2:37:51] men just taking taking to them wives.
[2:37:55] They didn't get married.
[2:37:57] Oh, has there ever been an age like
[2:37:59] this?
[2:38:00] &gt;&gt; Just take a woman. W woman just taking a
[2:38:03] man. In this day, as I said earlier,
[2:38:06] woman with woman, man with man, just
[2:38:08] taking woman. And now even on my
[2:38:09] marriage certificate, it has to do with
[2:38:12] partner.
[2:38:13] Which partner do you have? Why partner?
[2:38:16] What's wrong with wife?
[2:38:18] &gt;&gt; What's wrong with wife?
[2:38:20] &gt;&gt; What's wrong with husband?
[2:38:22] &gt;&gt; Who are they talking about?
[2:38:24] &gt;&gt; What are they trying to say?
[2:38:27] &gt;&gt; And that isn't my choice. That's imposed
[2:38:30] upon me as a minister of the gospel to
[2:38:32] marry people. And I'm to ask the young
[2:38:35] lady, do you want to keep your own name?
[2:38:39] Because there's a section there for to
[2:38:41] keep her own name. Do you want to go by
[2:38:43] your maiden name? The scripture teaches
[2:38:46] that the wife takes the husband's name.
[2:38:50] &gt;&gt; We've taken the name of Jesus Christ.
[2:38:53] &gt;&gt; Who here wants to say, "I want to go by
[2:38:55] own my own name." Your name's not worth
[2:38:56] anything.
[2:38:59] [Applause]
[2:39:00] &gt;&gt; It's not worth anything. It's only the
[2:39:02] trail of your lineage down here. We want
[2:39:04] to take his name. I want to be Mrs.
[2:39:07] Jesus.
[2:39:09] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:39:10] &gt;&gt; I want to become one with him.
[2:39:14] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:39:16] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:39:19] &gt;&gt; Well, if I left anything out, we'll come
[2:39:21] to it another time.
[2:39:31] &gt;&gt; We're going to see it, friends.
[2:39:33] We're going to see days yet that we
[2:39:35] never even thought was we'd ever see.
[2:39:38] &gt;&gt; They're on the way.
[2:39:40] &gt;&gt; I'm not speaking fear. I'm speaking very
[2:39:42] positive.
[2:39:44] &gt;&gt; I don't care what they do.
[2:39:45] &gt;&gt; Take the whole world.
[2:39:47] &gt;&gt; Give me Jesus. Let this whole world
[2:39:49] crumble.
[2:39:50] &gt;&gt; Just give me this word. Hallelujah. This
[2:39:53] word has seen me this far. And I've been
[2:39:55] so happy with this word. So happy with
[2:39:57] this message. So happy with thus sayeth
[2:40:00] the Lord. And the more I see the world
[2:40:02] crumble, I say, "Thank God I've got this
[2:40:04] word revealed.
[2:40:06] &gt;&gt; Thank God we got this message."
[2:40:10] &gt;&gt; Amen. Hallelujah.
[2:40:13] &gt;&gt; Glory to God.
[2:40:15] &gt;&gt; Let's sing a song.
[2:40:20] &gt;&gt; Are you ready to sing?
[2:40:21] &gt;&gt; Ready to worship.
[2:40:26] &gt;&gt; Right now, you know, I get so
[2:40:27] independent. I don't care how you did. I
[2:40:29] had a great time.
[2:40:31] &gt;&gt; I just love this word. I just love this
[2:40:33] message.
[2:40:34] Oh my heart.
[2:40:37] Amen.
[2:40:40] Let's sing take this whole world but
[2:40:42] give me Jesus. Why don't we stand and
[2:40:44] we'll just sing and worship a little
[2:40:45] bit.

[2:40:56] to follow Jesus.

[2:41:51] Take this for
[2:41:54] my Jesus.
[2:41:58] Take this for
[2:42:03] me Jesus.
[2:42:06] Take this for
[2:42:10] me Jesus.
[2:42:13] I won't die.

[2:43:43] hands with some folks. And Hallelujah.
[2:43:45] Why don't we just turn around, shake
[2:43:47] hands with you people. Say, "God bless
[2:43:49] you, brother Pilgrim.
[2:43:54] Bless you. God bless you.

[2:47:50] Brother Frank, would you come and ask a
[2:47:52] prayer blessing upon this group of
[2:47:55] people? Love Brother Frank's testimony
[2:47:58] and his approach,
[2:48:00] [Music]
[2:48:04] one antique to another.
[2:48:07] [Music]
[2:48:11] You know, one thing I enjoyed about
[2:48:13] brother Frank when I was
[2:48:15] just early into his uh coming to the
[2:48:19] knowledge of the message, I found this
[2:48:21] man very unusual. He talked about the
[2:48:24] bride. He would make comments about the
[2:48:26] bride and he had songs that from the old
[2:48:30] hymns about the bride of Christ. That
[2:48:32] always was something that must have
[2:48:34] stuck with him. And now he come to the
[2:48:36] message of the bride. God bless you,
[2:48:39] brother Frank. Amen.
[2:48:42] We just bow our hearts and heads
[2:48:44] together. Precious heavenly father, we
[2:48:46] thank you for the privilege of being
[2:48:47] able to be here today. Oh God, how
[2:48:50] faithful you are, Lord, faithful amongst
[2:48:53] unfaithful around us, but Lord, amongst
[2:48:56] your precious little bride. There's that
[2:48:57] faithfulness, Lord. That dedication, oh
[2:49:00] God, that you've put in our hearts to
[2:49:01] serve you and honor you, Lord, till you
[2:49:04] come, Lord. We we've heard all about
[2:49:06] what's going what's happening around the
[2:49:07] world, but we know that you have secure
[2:49:09] you've secured us in your in your word,
[2:49:12] oh Lord, to glorify your holy name,
[2:49:14] Lord.
[2:49:15] &gt;&gt; We thank you, Lord, for this time
[2:49:17] together. Bless your precious servant,
[2:49:19] Brother Ed, and strengthen him for
[2:49:20] further labors, Lord, and give him
