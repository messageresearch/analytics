[1:15:16] well we're just going to change a little
[1:15:17] bit of the order of the evening right
[1:15:19] now we have a little bit of a surprise
[1:15:21] maybe
[1:15:22] for most of you tonight we are going to
[1:15:25] have brother caleb from shanghai china
[1:15:28] speak to us brother murphy would you
[1:15:30] mind joining us please
[1:15:33] this is a very special event for me i
[1:15:36] just want to hold it all together
[1:15:41] we've loved him
[1:15:43] we have known caleb before marriage
[1:15:45] we've known him with brother murphy
[1:15:47] we've had the privilege to go
[1:15:48] and be with the man of god such he is
[1:15:52] we mentioned it to the
[1:15:54] saints at the november meeting down in
[1:15:57] at mount baker
[1:15:59] of the the events that took place and
[1:16:02] the arrests that were taking place
[1:16:04] and how that then brother payne was the
[1:16:06] first that was released in june brother
[1:16:09] elvi in august
[1:16:11] and he went after he got out of out of
[1:16:13] incarceration went out and baptized
[1:16:15] three more people
[1:16:18] so here we are with brother caleb who
[1:16:20] was released november the 11th
[1:16:23] and was in uh for 20 months
[1:16:26] 20 months as i said to the saints can
[1:16:28] you imagine 20 months the church in
[1:16:30] shanghai never had a service
[1:16:33] for 20 months the saints didn't gather
[1:16:36] and they all met brother caleb when he
[1:16:38] came out of
[1:16:40] incarceration
[1:16:41] and not one of the church was missing
[1:16:45] that's the word standing
[1:16:54] brother murphy would you please
[1:16:56] introduce
[1:16:58] hundreds
[1:17:00] but we understand that the gospel
[1:17:02] of jesus christ
[1:17:06] is the same yesterday
[1:17:08] today and forever
[1:17:10] the bible says when one member suffers
[1:17:12] we all suffer
[1:17:14] but when one rejoices we all rejoice
[1:17:17] and i want to thank the lord jesus that
[1:17:19] you as a church body have been a part of
[1:17:22] what god's been doing in china and we'll
[1:17:24] continue to support whatever god and
[1:17:27] whatever doors god opens for us so i
[1:17:30] thought that that would be a wonderful
[1:17:31] segment in this
[1:17:33] going into this new end of one year and
[1:17:35] going into a new year to see these
[1:17:37] brothers have sacrificed their all
[1:17:39] for their message and it gives me a
[1:17:42] challenge
[1:17:43] to accept
[1:17:44] that we could do the same
[1:17:46] amen well
[1:17:50] i think i would like to invite a couple
[1:17:52] of brothers up here with me
[1:17:54] and michael brother sam would you please
[1:17:56] come up brother dan would you please
[1:17:59] come up
[1:18:00] brother jean would you please come up
[1:18:03] come on up
[1:18:08] so we've gone from the mission fields to
[1:18:10] a local field
[1:18:12] our local assembly
[1:18:24] wasn't in your day
[1:18:29] hey michael come sit down
[1:18:39] well this is the beginnings of a prayer
[1:18:40] group
[1:18:42] a group of men that were burdened for
[1:18:44] our assembly
[1:18:46] and maybe sam if you would like to say
[1:18:48] something
[1:18:52] well good evening everyone
[1:18:54] and uh sorry i got to read notes here i
[1:18:57] scribbled down some thoughts on paper
[1:18:58] just to
[1:19:00] um
[1:19:03] just to say how much i appreciate
[1:19:06] this last year and being able to
[1:19:09] walk together with you and
[1:19:14] so it's been an honor and privilege to
[1:19:16] walk together and uh to see each one of
[1:19:19] you doing your part laboring for the
[1:19:21] lord
[1:19:22] to see what brother caleb has done
[1:19:26] it's
[1:19:27] it's humbling to to sit here after that
[1:19:29] and
[1:19:31] and you know everyone's got to do their
[1:19:32] part so you find out what you uh what
[1:19:36] you can do
[1:19:37] and that's what
[1:19:39] i think the lord was dealing with
[1:19:41] with our hearts early this year
[1:19:45] i think individually
[1:19:47] the lord was dealing with you down
[1:19:50] brother jean was coming to the church
[1:19:52] praying praying by himself wanting the
[1:19:54] lord to do something
[1:19:57] and
[1:19:58] i think brother johnny waldner had come
[1:20:00] up and said something about we need we
[1:20:02] need to
[1:20:04] we need to start maybe having a prayer
[1:20:07] meeting or let's let's get together
[1:20:10] and that's kind of how
[1:20:13] the brothers started to get together and
[1:20:15] we wanted to talk about the lord and
[1:20:17] share what the lord is doing
[1:20:19] with each one
[1:20:22] the year has been a challenging time but
[1:20:24] the lord has given his grace
[1:20:26] and and i definitely
[1:20:28] to see
[1:20:30] some of the prayers the the requests
[1:20:32] that have been prayed i wanted to see
[1:20:34] how many
[1:20:35] um
[1:20:37] young one not just young ones but how
[1:20:38] many have been baptized this year
[1:20:41] is there i know brother nathaniel vizso
[1:20:43] god dealt with you
[1:20:45] um
[1:20:46] just put your hands up
[1:20:48] brother hudson
[1:20:50] or
[1:20:51] your sister reya
[1:20:52] um
[1:20:54] yeah sister rebecca
[1:20:56] gwyneth i mean they're
[1:21:00] yeah more i i think there's a ton and
[1:21:02] that's kind of what our
[1:21:04] burden was is our families and uh i
[1:21:07] don't know you want to
[1:21:09] see a little bit
[1:21:10] [Music]
[1:21:11] living in one uh yeah like brother sam
[1:21:14] said uh it was right in the middle of of
[1:21:17] koved uh we didn't have services we're
[1:21:20] streaming
[1:21:21] and we just got you know under under a
[1:21:23] burden uh i remember i i was at home and
[1:21:26] i told my wife i need to go to the
[1:21:27] church i need to be in prayer and i
[1:21:29] texted brother mike i was like can you
[1:21:31] meet me at the church and open the
[1:21:32] sanctuary though for me and we met here
[1:21:35] and i was just here with myself and i
[1:21:37] just you know just burdened and
[1:21:39] just prayed
[1:21:41] then we met at the end and he told me
[1:21:43] that other brothers were also
[1:21:45] thinking about starting a prayer meeting
[1:21:47] and we'll just see how the lord leads so
[1:21:49] it was just supernatural how
[1:21:52] without really planning without texting
[1:21:54] or anything just god just started
[1:21:56] dealing with each one of us i'm just a
[1:21:58] burden for
[1:21:59] for prayer
[1:22:02] um yeah good evening everybody um
[1:22:06] that's exactly how it was it was just
[1:22:08] and i know from in my heart it was
[1:22:11] we were in the middle of covet and if
[1:22:12] everyone can remember the church was
[1:22:14] completely empty we're just a few of us
[1:22:16] here to run video and sound and things
[1:22:20] and i know throughout the 2020 and into
[1:22:23] 2021 um
[1:22:25] it just
[1:22:26] didn't bring a coldness but it brought
[1:22:28] um just a lack of togetherness and you
[1:22:31] could feel it in your own lives even
[1:22:33] individually and collectively
[1:22:35] and so i for my burden it started around
[1:22:38] the time of easter and i was streaming a
[1:22:39] service and you know just something just
[1:22:43] dropped in my heart and the lord was
[1:22:44] just like
[1:22:45] do something
[1:22:47] you need to do something and i know many
[1:22:49] times even in our own minds we say okay
[1:22:51] what's the what's the ministry going to
[1:22:52] do what's the pastor going to do what's
[1:22:54] this person going to do maybe someone
[1:22:56] should start something but the lord just
[1:22:57] dropped in my heart do something and so
[1:22:59] i didn't know what it was i was like
[1:23:00] okay lord what what is this and just
[1:23:02] reading in the message from you know a
[1:23:04] couple messages desperations and and
[1:23:07] conference with god and that's been a
[1:23:08] special message of my life
[1:23:10] and i was like you know like we can have
[1:23:12] a conference let's have a conference
[1:23:14] with god and you know i know there was a
[1:23:15] couple of brothers on my heart that god
[1:23:17] had kind of put on my heart that i knew
[1:23:19] were in the same
[1:23:20] victory and myself we had talked i think
[1:23:22] mike we i sat in your office and we had
[1:23:24] talked and then from there i just i came
[1:23:26] to talk to you by the time and then you
[1:23:27] know you had said oh sam had been
[1:23:29] talking about it john hadn't talked to
[1:23:30] mike about it so we're like okay if this
[1:23:32] is kind of where the lord is leading
[1:23:34] then you know what can we do can we
[1:23:36] should we how can we do it and so we
[1:23:38] obviously spoke with you
[1:23:40] and initially we're just going to all
[1:23:42] come as brothers and just sit in the
[1:23:43] sanctuary here and just have a little
[1:23:44] word of prayer just to be together but
[1:23:46] it kind of grew from that and we kind of
[1:23:48] we wanted to more have a bond and be
[1:23:50] able to fellowship around the things of
[1:23:51] god and just to lift each other up and
[1:23:53] so kind of started with just about nine
[1:23:55] nine ten brothers i think it was i think
[1:23:57] the four of us on this couch and then i
[1:23:59] think victor and david adamurra was the
[1:24:02] first ones john wallner who was one of
[1:24:03] the first ones as well
[1:24:05] my dad as well
[1:24:07] and from there it just it just grew and
[1:24:09] grew and the lord has been moving and
[1:24:10] doing wonderful things to the prayer
[1:24:12] meeting so that's that's kind of the
[1:24:14] start of it
[1:24:20] so
[1:24:21] there's a quote in business and i've
[1:24:23] mentioned it to the uh
[1:24:25] the brothers many times but i'm gonna
[1:24:27] reiterate it here today
[1:24:29] and it says managers push people to do
[1:24:31] things they don't want to do
[1:24:34] but leaders inspire people to do things
[1:24:36] they never thought they could
[1:24:38] and
[1:24:40] you know uh
[1:24:41] when this faith challenge report came
[1:24:43] out
[1:24:44] on the
[1:24:45] picture was
[1:24:47] brother biscuit and brother lonnie
[1:24:48] jenkins probably in their
[1:24:51] i don't know late 30s early 40s
[1:24:54] um
[1:24:55] doing what they could
[1:24:59] doing exactly what brother caleb
[1:25:01] has inspired brother caleb to do it's
[1:25:03] been
[1:25:04] 50 years
[1:25:06] of
[1:25:08] a vision and of leadership and i think
[1:25:12] it's it's so important to recognize the
[1:25:15] um
[1:25:16] the inspiring leadership that has been
[1:25:20] given our example
[1:25:21] um so not only from from brother biscuit
[1:25:24] but it's come down from brother tom
[1:25:26] brother murphy brother tim um
[1:25:29] we're not talking about uh
[1:25:32] people who
[1:25:33] who are just talking about doing
[1:25:36] something but actually doing it um you
[1:25:39] know brother brown have said you know
[1:25:41] he's not one to go around and kiss the
[1:25:43] babies but he's you know wielding a
[1:25:45] sword um
[1:25:47] you know he talked about the fireman the
[1:25:49] little fireman who's you know running
[1:25:50] around
[1:25:51] you know at the big fire and he's like a
[1:25:54] little fire here a little fire there and
[1:25:55] then the the big chief came in from
[1:25:58] jeffersonville and he said follow me
[1:25:59] boys like we're gonna we're gonna do
[1:26:02] something and get this done
[1:26:05] and i think
[1:26:06] those examples have now
[1:26:10] been our examples
[1:26:12] so now you've got brothers you've got
[1:26:14] next generations that are now
[1:26:16] needing to step up and are stepping up
[1:26:19] and
[1:26:20] [Music]
[1:26:21] you know the prayer meeting we started
[1:26:23] with brothers and we've had actually one
[1:26:26] and we want to do
[1:26:29] one every month with the families where
[1:26:31] we come with their wives and our
[1:26:32] children
[1:26:34] because not only do we have you know
[1:26:37] the ministry
[1:26:39] as leaders but the fathers and husbands
[1:26:42] that's a strong home strong strong
[1:26:44] husband strong fathers strong homes
[1:26:47] strong families
[1:26:48] that's really what is needed
[1:26:52] and uh
[1:26:53] that became a burden in the prayer
[1:26:56] meetings of
[1:26:58] um our families our homes and that's why
[1:27:00] we were praying for our children and
[1:27:02] then for brother ray to come with his
[1:27:04] son nathaniel and nathanael get gives
[1:27:07] his heart to the lord
[1:27:08] these are massive milestones for
[1:27:11] for our um
[1:27:13] you know we started putting down on the
[1:27:14] board answered prayer
[1:27:16] um
[1:27:17] because
[1:27:18] we can pray for so many things but we
[1:27:21] want to see god
[1:27:22] answering
[1:27:23] so
[1:27:25] you know you just heard brother caleb
[1:27:27] say
[1:27:28] his
[1:27:29] son
[1:27:30] needed prayer who prayed
[1:27:33] brother tom
[1:27:34] god answered prayer
[1:27:37] and
[1:27:38] and that's
[1:27:39] where what we are expecting we are
[1:27:41] expecting god to answer prayer
[1:27:43] so
[1:27:45] you know um
[1:27:48] what really touched me i don't know how
[1:27:50] many months ago or when brother henry
[1:27:53] came up here to be prayed for
[1:27:56] he needed prayer
[1:27:57] and
[1:27:59] brother tom came down to pray for him
[1:28:02] like
[1:28:03] a dad is praying for his son
[1:28:05] you know i i want we all need to know
[1:28:10] when we come up for prayer
[1:28:12] there's confidence there that god is
[1:28:14] going to answer prayer
[1:28:16] uh the father's in the home when when
[1:28:19] the children are sick
[1:28:21] the wife and the children need to know
[1:28:23] that when the daddy comes down to pray
[1:28:25] god is going to answer the prayer
[1:28:28] so we have the examples
[1:28:31] and now it's moving
[1:28:33] into the next
[1:28:35] generation and inspiring the next
[1:28:37] generations to
[1:28:39] to do that to to
[1:28:41] step into their
[1:28:43] into their position
[1:28:45] and uh
[1:28:51] so yeah as our ministry praise god
[1:28:53] answers the brothers and sisters pray
[1:28:55] god answers big or small god answers
[1:28:57] prayer so we just wrote down a few
[1:28:59] things
[1:29:01] that god answered in the last few months
[1:29:04] brother gabe florent
[1:29:06] there's a whole testimony from two weeks
[1:29:09] before he
[1:29:10] came to church
[1:29:12] but
[1:29:14] the florent family
[1:29:15] was having a baby dedication
[1:29:17] and it was premeditated they're praying
[1:29:20] that god is going to deal with
[1:29:24] their their children
[1:29:25] and
[1:29:26] god answered
[1:29:28] and there's been many yes
[1:29:30] contin you know things that followed
[1:29:32] through that uh brother phil i talk
[1:29:35] over on vancouver island
[1:29:37] needing god to deal with his life
[1:29:39] needing a job
[1:29:41] god's trying he's he's a prince sitting
[1:29:43] over here
[1:29:45] you know in our congregation god

[1:29:48] um brother victor and sister sarah
[1:29:50] adamura had a baby that was being
[1:29:52] medevaced

[1:32:28] the doctors diagnosed my wife and the
[1:32:31] baby that she has inside of her that
[1:32:35] was something called trisomy 18 which
[1:32:37] meant that the baby would be born with

[1:32:40] or it wouldn't live past
[1:32:42] uh a month of its birth
[1:32:44] and since we're here this is squash
[1:32:46] tonight we just want to give testimony
[1:32:47] to the lord and

[1:32:50] weeks uh that we didn't hear back we had
[1:32:53] to go run some different tests
[1:32:55] but that day i immediately um the
[1:32:57] scripture says go to the elders of the
[1:32:59] church and have them lay hands on you

[1:54:36] brother uh sanjeev he he knows brother
[1:54:39] roshan and also brother tim dodd when
[1:54:42] brother tim was over in india they met
[1:54:44] yeah we went you met yeah and the god of
[1:54:47] course started to deal with our dear
[1:54:50] brother there
[1:54:51] and
[1:54:52] he's come here and he desires to be
[1:54:54] baptized in the name of the lord
[1:54:57] jesus christ
[1:54:58] and we are speaking on sunday
[1:55:01] and
[1:55:02] everybody was gone and he says he knew
[1:55:05] the baptismal tank was here he said
[1:55:07] there's water there what does hinder me
[1:55:10] and so i thought of course through the
[1:55:12] scripture in acts 8 where there was a
[1:55:15] ethiopian eunuch and god caught philip
[1:55:18] up in the spirit
[1:55:20] and beginning at jesus christ he
[1:55:22] preached the cross
[1:55:24] and that revelation struck that
[1:55:26] eunuch
[1:55:27] saw the water and said what doth hinder
[1:55:31] me and i said well
[1:55:33] how about a few days
[1:55:36] and i thought it would be something
[1:55:37] special to have a baptismal yeah on this
[1:55:40] new year's eve service
[1:55:41] to give god the glory
[1:55:43] and give him praise brother sanji

[2:28:31] this is
[2:28:35] [Music]
[2:28:51] one day old man brought a crippled man
[2:28:54] to jesus he's still in lifeless he lay
[2:28:58] upon his bed
[2:28:59] he had not moved since he was just a
[2:29:03] baby so still he longed to become a
[2:29:06] normal man now we don't know much about
[2:29:10] the men that carry the corners of his
[2:29:14] tattered bed that day
[2:29:16] but if we may create an illustration
[2:29:20] we'll see what these men might have to
[2:29:24] say
[2:29:24] suppose that first man said i hate to
[2:29:28] doubt it for jesus touched my eyes when
[2:29:32] i was blind he made me see and there's
[2:29:36] no doubt about it but this man's needs
[2:29:39] are more serious than mine suppose that
[2:29:43] second man said no need to bother this
[2:29:46] man's condition will remain the same
[2:29:50] though jesus touched my hand when it was
[2:29:53] withered i don't believe he could heal a
[2:29:57] man so lame suppose the third man said i
[2:30:01] hate the question but no one here is
[2:30:05] more skeptical than me though jesus
[2:30:08] cleansed me when i was a leper this
[2:30:11] helpless man will never walk his seat
[2:30:15] and every eye was turned to the fourth
[2:30:19] man to see how he might criticize and
[2:30:23] doubt but all three men were startled
[2:30:26] with amazement when that poor man
[2:30:29] stopped
[2:30:32] [Music]
[2:30:45] chains of death was found this man named
[2:30:49] jesus called me out if you think your
[2:30:52] little problem is too big for him to
[2:30:55] solve
[2:30:56] take it from the one who served the
[2:30:58] mighty voice
[2:30:59] [Music]

[2:31:25] think your little problem is too big for
[2:31:27] him to solve
[2:31:29] take it from the one who's heard the
[2:31:31] mighty voice of god a living testimony
[2:31:35] of his death defying touch
