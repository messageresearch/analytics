[10:11] hiding place?
[10:13] &gt;&gt; Amen. We were asked to to bring
[10:15] greetings from the saints in China. We
[10:17] got to visit a a small church out in the
[10:20] country and have fellowship with them
[10:22] and footwashing and communion with them.
[10:24] It was just it was a really wonderful
[10:25] experience to be with the saints there.
[10:28] So, we just want to remember them this
[10:29] evening. Amen. As we go to prayer.
[10:33] Father, we just bow before you this
[10:35] evening, Lord. So thankful for your
[10:37] mercy. So thankful for your grace, Lord.
[10:40] Father, we thank you for your blood,
[10:42] Lord, that allows us to stand here this
[10:44] evening washed and cleansed, Lord Jesus.
[10:47] We don't stand here in our own
[10:49] righteousness this evening. Father, we
[10:51] know that you're not looking at us this
[10:53] evening, but at the sacrifice, Father.
[10:56] Father, there's needs that have been
[10:57] laid on this table this evening, Father.
[11:00] And we just pray, Father, that you'd
[11:02] reach your hand out and touch each one,
[11:04] Lord Jesus. Have your way in each one of
[11:07] our lives, Father.
[11:09] Lord, we just want to worship you, Lord,
[11:11] this evening. We want to express our
[11:14] thanksgiving to you, Father, and to
[11:15] worship you and to thank you for your
[11:17] goodness, Lord. We want to make much of
[11:20] your presence this evening, Father, and
[11:22] not leaving you sitting in a corner with
[11:24] unwashed feet. Lord, we want to wash
[11:27] your feet this evening, Lord. We want
[11:29] to, Lord, be pleasing in your sight,
[11:32] Father.
[11:33] We ask, Father, that as the word would
[11:35] come forth this evening, Lord, that we
[11:38] could sit at your feet and be
[11:39] instructed, Lord, that you'd speak to
[11:42] us, Father, and teach us better how to
[11:44] go in and how to come out. Father,
[11:46] &gt;&gt; we thank you for your grace. Bless us
[11:49] with your presence, we pray, Father.
[11:51] Amen.

[14:51] me one more time.

[15:30] Can we sing the land?
[15:33] Amen.
[15:37] Now, what's the other
[15:40] sweet land? I'm kind of homesick for a
[15:43] country. Amen.
[15:47] Can only be homesick for a place that's
[15:48] called home. Amen.
[15:51] I'm kind of home
[15:57] sick for a country
[16:04] to

[17:16] [Music]
[17:22] &gt;&gt; I'm looking down.
[17:25] &gt;&gt; I'm looking down
[17:30] across the river
[17:33] [Music]
[17:35] to where my
[17:41] will end his

[18:51] &gt;&gt; I'm looking now. Let's stand as we sing
[18:53] it. I'm looking

[19:56] I'll be I'll stand
[20:02] there. My home
[20:07] shall be
[20:13] to the lamb.
[20:17] [Music]
[20:26] That's our purpose of being here
[20:27] tonight.
[20:31] &gt;&gt; We're a journey. We're on a journey.
[20:33] That's where we're going. Amen. I'll
[20:36] need lots of Thank you.
[20:40] Are you all happy?
[20:42] &gt;&gt; Good. Ready to hear the word?
[20:46] &gt;&gt; We want to have prayer and we're going
[20:48] to pray for our sister, sister Felina
[20:51] Drossst.
[20:52] And she's in the hospital, but brother
[20:55] Tony and brother John Andy's went to
[20:59] pray with her.
[21:01] And uh we understand that she really
[21:05] stabilized and so much so that her son,
[21:08] brother Arnold Drossst, is here and he's
[21:11] a pastor from Chadam, Ontario. Brother
[21:13] Dross, would you just raise your hand so
[21:15] you know there? We're happy to have you
[21:17] this evening. God bless you. Brother
[21:21] Arnold Dross was at his mother's side.
[21:24] He's a minister of this message.
[21:27] Was standing there and and has said that
[21:29] she took her off of oxygen and so he
[21:33] came here to service tonight. God bless
[21:35] you, brother.
[21:37] Appreciate having you. Is your wife with
[21:39] you?
[21:41] All right. God bless you. Hi. You're
[21:45] welcome. Welcome.
[21:51] Well, I say that Sister Felina Dross is
[21:54] a real soldier.
[21:56] &gt;&gt; When I heard she was very weak and very
[22:00] low and the family had gathered,
[22:03] uh
[22:05] there's one thing I could say of her.
[22:09] She's probably one of the most
[22:10] perceptive
[22:13] and most desirous of women
[22:17] that I've met in the message. Just eager
[22:20] to hear the next little tidbit.
[22:24] Anything you've got. She reminds me a
[22:27] wee bit of uh Sister Glattis Dao that
[22:29] way. She just if you're with her, she
[22:31] wants to hear what
[22:33] you know, almost like wanting to pull it
[22:35] out of you. And I appreciate that. She's
[22:38] a wonderful woman. Brother Dross,
[22:42] we'll just have prayer.
[22:45] How lovely you are, Father.
[22:48] How lovely you are. And we are able to
[22:50] come this evening and say, "Our Father,
[22:53] which art in heaven,
[22:55] Lord, we are your children."
[22:58] &gt;&gt; And uh we do not know our next footstep,
[23:01] but you do know it. You know the
[23:03] beginning from the end. We're so
[23:05] thankful tonight, Lord, that our sister
[23:07] Dross has been strengthened and and
[23:10] brother Arnold and his wife, oh God, are
[23:12] able to be with us in service tonight.
[23:15] And I pray that there will be a just uh
[23:19] uh an illumination of grace. And may the
[23:22] pillar of fire be in attendance where
[23:25] our sister is resting just now. We pray
[23:28] that you'd speak to every member of the
[23:31] family, oh God, and give them the
[23:34] strength and the comfort, oh God, and
[23:36] let them know also, oh God, that here's
[23:40] a mother that has lived a life and lived
[23:45] a testimony and she's been amongst us,
[23:48] oh God, and fellowshipped around the
[23:50] word. We thank you for that. Pray that
[23:53] you'll give our brother George Dross,
[23:55] Lord. Give him the courage. Give him the
[23:58] comfort. Give him and grant him the
[24:01] faith, Father, at this moment. And we
[24:03] thank you for this answer, Lord. How
[24:05] many times your prophet said that just
[24:08] go thanking him now. I have no question
[24:11] in my mind that our sister Felina is
[24:15] thanking you. And there's a uh within
[24:18] her within her lips, Lord, and within
[24:21] her mouth is a thanksgiving to you for
[24:23] your goodness to her this evening. Lord,
[24:26] we need your goodness. We need your Holy
[24:29] Spirit. We need your presence. We need,
[24:32] oh God, that outpouring, that anointing
[24:36] that you will pour through myself,
[24:38] Father, whatever you would have to have
[24:41] poured in to the individual, Lord. And I
[24:44] pray there will be a place made and a
[24:46] channel open, oh God, let the fountain,
[24:50] oh God, be opened, I pray. and let
[24:53] everyone receive what they have need of
[24:55] tonight. And as we've already prayed in
[24:58] the study this evening that the sheep
[25:00] will be fed in the name of Jesus Christ.
[25:03] These are your sheep, Lord. They are
[25:06] this is your fold and I pray that you
[25:09] will bless us as we gather around the
[25:10] word tonight for your glory. Amen.
[25:15] &gt;&gt; Amen. God bless you. I'll have you turn
[25:17] in your Bibles, please, to Isaiah the
[25:20] 61st chapter.
[25:32] and we will read
[25:36] uh verse
[25:38] two.
[25:39] I'll be reading verse one a little later
[25:41] on.
[25:44] No, perhaps we should read verse one as
[25:46] well, please.
[25:48] because it gives us the
[25:54] the spirit of the Lord. The spirit of
[25:56] the Lord God is upon me because the Lord
[25:59] hath anointed me to preach good tidings
[26:02] unto the meek. He hath sent me to bind
[26:05] up the brokenhearted,
[26:07] to proclaim liberty to the captives, and
[26:10] the opening of the prison to them that
[26:12] are bound, to proclaim the acceptable
[26:16] year of the Lord, and the day of
[26:18] vengeance of our God, to comfort all
[26:22] that mourn.
[26:25] I'm reading these verses which are so
[26:27] familiar to us. Then in Malachi
[26:31] uh 4th chapter verse 5 and six, behold I
[26:35] will send you Elijah the prophet before
[26:37] the coming of the great and dreadful day
[26:39] of the Lord. He shall turn the heart of
[26:42] the fathers to the children and the
[26:44] heart of the children to their fathers,
[26:47] lest I come and smite the earth with a
[26:50] curse.
[26:53] I'm reading one verse
[26:56] out of Isaiah once again, the fourth
[26:58] chapter.
[27:00] And if you'd like to turn to it,
[27:04] it's the sixth verse.
[27:06] And there shall be a tabernacle for a
[27:09] shadow in the daytime from the heat, and
[27:13] for a place of refuge, and for a covert
[27:18] from storm, and from rain. I'd like if
[27:22] we would read that together because it's
[27:24] so personal to us. And there shall be a
[27:29] tabernacle for a shadow in the daytime
[27:32] from the heat and for a place of refuge
[27:36] and for a covert from storm and from
[27:39] rain. God bless you as you have your
[27:41] seats.
[27:46] I had a very very specific reason for
[27:49] reading these uh verses. I'm going to
[27:52] approach a thought that I have never
[27:55] spoken
[27:57] in in my memory unless my memor is real
[28:00] short. I don't think it's that short. I
[28:03] don't believe I've ever spoken on this
[28:05] subject in my life.
[28:08] And I'm going to speak on the day of
[28:10] vengeance.
[28:12] There's a couple things that are I've
[28:16] been pondering and meditating on and I'm
[28:19] going to present it to you this evening,
[28:21] the Lord willing.
[28:23] When Isaiah said that
[28:26] uh we have a place of refuge and for a
[28:30] covert, those are similar words, but a
[28:34] refuge is a shelter from storm,
[28:37] from danger.
[28:39] And listen closely. And a protection
[28:42] from falsehood.
[28:44] That's an important one.
[28:47] &gt;&gt; That's the kind of refuge we need. This
[28:50] is a refuge. It's a shelter from storm
[28:53] where we come through tempestuous times.
[28:57] It's also they can be dangerous times.
[28:59] And we have a refuge. We have
[29:01] protection. And I can tell you that God
[29:04] has protected you when you didn't even
[29:06] know what was happening.
[29:08] And it's also a protection from
[29:11] falsehood. And that one I'm very
[29:13] grateful for tonight.
[29:15] &gt;&gt; If it was not for that, we would get
[29:17] into a lot of error and falsehood
[29:20] because we don't have the sufficient
[29:23] balance within ourselves. We thank God
[29:26] for the Holy Spirit that gives us the
[29:28] protection from falsehood. And then the
[29:31] covert. It's a covert. And for a covert
[29:34] from storm and from rain. And a covert
[29:38] is to be hidden. We are hid with Christ
[29:42] in God. We are hidden. We are concealed.
[29:45] And it is to be concealed. And to hide
[29:48] carefully.
[29:50] It's not something you just hide
[29:51] quickly. But we have been hidden very
[29:54] carefully,
[29:56] very purposefully
[29:58] by God in Christ. And so that really
[30:02] gives a a a well-rounded out uh picture
[30:07] of our protection and what Isaiah is
[30:10] speaking of here.
[30:13] And the reason I
[30:16] am approaching this and spoke of Malachi
[30:19] and also out of Isaiah because you
[30:22] remember you that are believers and are
[30:25] familiar with the message
[30:27] uh and all those that are streaming
[30:29] tonight. We pray God bless them. But
[30:32] when Jesus in the fourth chapter of Luke
[30:35] and he stood up in the synagogue as was
[30:38] his it was his that was his what he did
[30:43] uh that was his uh custom the Bible says
[30:46] and he stood up for it to read and the
[30:49] book of Isaiah was given to him the
[30:51] scroll and he found the place and read
[30:53] Isaiah 1 and2 only he he uh only read
[30:59] half of chapter of the second verse
[31:01] rather
[31:02] to proclaim the acceptable year of the
[31:04] Lord. And the Bible says, "And he closed
[31:07] the book and gave it back to the
[31:09] minister to proclaim the acceptable year
[31:13] of the Lord." And I looked into the uh I
[31:16] have Hebrew Bibles and it's really is
[31:20] worded wonderfully when it speaks of uh
[31:23] to
[31:25] to proclaim the acceptable year of the
[31:27] Lord.
[31:29] In the Hebrew, it's worded this way, to
[31:32] proclaim the year of acceptance of
[31:35] Jehovah. And that puts a completely
[31:38] different slant on it because what what
[31:41] Jesus was doing to proclaim the
[31:44] acceptable year of the Lord, he's
[31:46] proclaiming that that he has been
[31:50] accepted of Jehovah. This is the
[31:53] accepted one. And that's why the Bible
[31:56] says also we are accepted in the beloved
[32:01] because he was accepted. You are
[32:03] accepted.
[32:04] &gt;&gt; I would like to say that the ministry
[32:06] that brother Brandham had in this day
[32:09] which was not his ministry just in
[32:12] particular you can't separate the
[32:14] message from the messenger. But the
[32:16] thing that I kind of closed on, if
[32:19] perhaps I can have you uh go back to to
[32:23] Sunday, is that there never been a
[32:25] ministry quite like this. And in this
[32:27] aspect, which I did not mention, that
[32:30] ministry never failed to be accepted.
[32:33] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[32:35] &gt;&gt; The pillar of fire. I mentioned this to
[32:37] you. the pillar of fire. Whether it was
[32:39] Bombay or Durban or Johannesburg or
[32:41] Germany or Switzerland or up in the
[32:44] Scandinavian countries or in Finland or
[32:46] any any place in North America, wherever
[32:49] it was, that pillar of fire came in
[32:52] attendance and let you and I know that
[32:55] that ministry was accepted by Almighty
[32:58] God because he's the only one who can do
[33:00] that supernatural
[33:02] &gt;&gt; and he's the only one. And he said, you
[33:04] know, if if what I've said is the truth,
[33:07] then let him come and prove that it's
[33:09] the truth. And and then I if God uh if
[33:13] God were to lead us astray and then a
[33:15] bunch of falsehood was preached and he
[33:17] came in behind and and gave evidence to
[33:21] it, what kind of a God would that be? He
[33:24] gave evidence to it because it was the
[33:25] truth that we were hearing.
[33:27] &gt;&gt; And and herein is our faith and our
[33:29] confidence. Can you say amen to that?
[33:32] &gt;&gt; Amen. And so he was accepted to proclaim
[33:36] the year not only the acceptable year
[33:38] but to proclaim the year of acceptance
[33:41] of Jehovah. And he closed the book. But
[33:45] then the rest of the book says and the
[33:48] day of vengeance of our God.
[33:53] And Malachi says
[33:56] and the day the dreadful day of the
[33:59] Lord.
[34:00] So I want to uh address those two.
[34:05] Uh
[34:07] we are living presently and you walked
[34:10] into this church this evening from the
[34:13] world that you were engaged in. But this
[34:16] world has been indicted
[34:19] &gt;&gt; by this accepted ministry.
[34:23] &gt;&gt; It's under indictment.
[34:26] &gt;&gt; Want your attention please. As little
[34:28] movement as possible.
[34:31] The world has come under indictment. The
[34:33] prophet has already said, "I indict this
[34:35] generation." I'll read those for you.
[34:39] But you know what?
[34:42] It doesn't really look like it's
[34:43] indicted.
[34:45] People aren't really living like they're
[34:47] under the shadows of judgment.
[34:50] &gt;&gt; They're just doing okay.
[34:52] &gt;&gt; And you know why? Because also the
[34:57] prophet said this is the most deceptive
[35:00] age.
[35:02] &gt;&gt; So now we have in this age has come a
[35:06] light a true light.
[35:09] &gt;&gt; And the only light that is actually true
[35:11] light happens to be a promise of God
[35:15] that is set for a certain time and then
[35:18] God manifests it. That is light and God
[35:22] spoke and that is light. God's word
[35:25] manifested is light.
[35:29] &gt;&gt; But you know there's a lot of artificial
[35:31] lights.
[35:32] &gt;&gt; There's a lot of artificial lights.
[35:35] Satan has a whole myriad of artificial
[35:39] lights.
[35:40] &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham calls them glare.
[35:43] &gt;&gt; They're a glare. People are living in a
[35:45] glare. He tied it right to a
[35:47] denominational system. I would say if a
[35:49] if the denomination is a false light,
[35:52] there's multitudes of false lights.
[35:55] &gt;&gt; We were driving here this evening and
[35:56] there was very unusual sky and the moon
[35:59] was just peeking over some very very
[36:00] dark storm clouds and it was just a a
[36:04] magnificent site. We began to talk
[36:06] about, you know, the people of ancient
[36:08] times and how they looked into the
[36:10] heavens and saw all the different uh all
[36:13] the different configurations of the
[36:15] stars and and studied it and very wise
[36:18] people. But today, you can hardly see,
[36:20] you know, the stars because we've got so
[36:22] much artificial light in Satan's Eden.
[36:26] And so in the natural world, even in the
[36:28] natural world, you can't even see the
[36:30] beauty as it really is because Satan has
[36:33] produced us in Satan's Eden so much
[36:35] artificial light that we don't we rarely
[36:37] look up there. But people in ancient
[36:39] times, they always look to the heavens.
[36:42] &gt;&gt; They were always studying the heavens
[36:45] &gt;&gt; and it meant something to them. But
[36:47] today in the spiritual sense,
[36:50] Satan has he's a master of deception
[36:55] &gt;&gt; and he's produced so much artificial
[36:57] light that people don't really feel as
[37:00] though they're groping in darkness.
[37:06] &gt;&gt; One of the other promises which we have
[37:10] is regarding death itself. Yay, though I
[37:13] walk through the valley of the shadow of
[37:15] death, I will fear no evil, for thou art
[37:18] with me. Thy rod and thy staff, they
[37:21] comfort me. And Paul said, "So when this
[37:24] corruptible shall have put on
[37:26] incorruption, and this mortal shall have
[37:28] put on immortality, then shall be
[37:30] brought to pass the saying that is
[37:32] written, death is swallowed up in
[37:34] victory." This is the promise of God.
[37:37] This is for believers. But do you know
[37:38] that Satan has so crafted,
[37:42] he's such a master of deception that
[37:45] those that are walking in darkness
[37:49] and those that are walking in death,
[37:53] &gt;&gt; they don't really have a great fear of
[37:55] it.
[37:57] &gt;&gt; They don't really fear it because they
[37:58] have a false promise.
[38:01] &gt;&gt; They have a false concept. and Satan has
[38:05] mastered
[38:07] at at
[38:09] giving them a a false hope. There's all
[38:13] kinds of people, they don't really fear
[38:15] death.
[38:19] It's incredible walking in the day of in
[38:23] the day of vengeance.
[38:25] It's it's actually here, friends.
[38:28] &gt;&gt; We're walking in that day. and and Satan
[38:31] has also succeeded in making the
[38:34] people's minds numb.
[38:38] I would say that probably television
[38:41] and the technology that is in the world
[38:45] now and it's also directed to the youth.
[38:49] It's not technology to help skilled
[38:51] people to be better equipped for their
[38:55] jobs and that also. But the big thing
[38:59] today, you know,
[39:02] is young people, children, young
[39:05] children, and they get all kinds of
[39:08] games and videos. Oh, we might think
[39:11] that that isn't really something that
[39:12] needs to be spoken about over the
[39:14] pulpit, but I'll tell you one thing. It
[39:16] starts to it starts to affect their
[39:18] minds.
[39:20] &gt;&gt; It starts to affect their brain and they
[39:23] see all kinds of violent things
[39:26] happening and so violence doesn't mean a
[39:28] whole lot to them.
[39:32] &gt;&gt; Right here in our city of Suri, which is
[39:35] not news to anybody that lives here, but
[39:38] but six people just blown away here in
[39:41] apartment the other day. Six people
[39:45] killed. They don't have anybody.
[39:48] And a and a man from uh I believe it's
[39:51] from the North View Menite Church, but
[39:53] he's from Abbottzford. Happened to be a
[39:56] repairman. He's just repairing a
[39:57] fireplace.
[40:00] Just their innocent man. Could be any
[40:02] man from here. Two children, family.
[40:05] Pastor got up and spoke of him. Just a
[40:08] wonderful man of the community. just
[40:09] because he happened to be there
[40:10] repairing when they came in to do away
[40:13] with these other men and they just shot
[40:16] him too. And someone else from an
[40:18] apartment upstairs, a young man, he
[40:20] happened to be in the wrong place the
[40:21] wrong time shot him too. They're just
[40:24] gone.
[40:26] Well, sure that you know the community
[40:29] is shocked and it's a it's a terrible
[40:31] tragedy, etc., etc., but you know what?
[40:35] tomorrow morning's newspaper will have
[40:36] some other tragedy
[40:39] &gt;&gt; and we just we just go on from there
[40:41] because we're numbed by the whole thing.
[40:43] That's the age that we're in. That's
[40:45] actually the age that we're in.
[40:47] &gt;&gt; But can people for a moment even begin
[40:50] to grasp? No, I say they cannot grasp
[40:54] what it is to die without God.
[40:59] And to slip out into eternity without
[41:02] God,
[41:04] that is the most I can't even
[41:06] comprehend. I can't comprehend anyone
[41:08] even sitting in the house of God such as
[41:11] we are this evening. And with that
[41:14] prospect of even like some I've even
[41:18] heard say, well, you know, if I miss the
[41:20] rapture, I got the tribulation. You
[41:23] know, I'll make it. Don't count on that.
[41:29] &gt;&gt; And so, he has made artificial lights.
[41:33] He has glamorized the world through
[41:37] glamour and through pleasure and a
[41:39] multitude of false religions.
[41:42] He's made a dark place, not so very
[41:44] dark.
[41:47] He's made a place that's actually under
[41:49] the judgment of all almighty God. And I
[41:52] I can tell you that's a master of
[41:53] deception when they can have a whole
[41:56] generation indicted.
[42:01] &gt;&gt; But they don't feel that. They don't
[42:02] feel that way.
[42:04] &gt;&gt; And you and I are around them every day.
[42:06] And we're in that. The one thing I don't
[42:09] want to
[42:11] and it came as a really a sharp thought
[42:15] to me.
[42:17] We don't want to as believers move
[42:19] around in the world and be also numbed
[42:23] by the fact that or influenced by the
[42:26] fact that this world really isn't that
[42:29] bad. It's a very vile place.
[42:32] &gt;&gt; And we're not here just to complain and
[42:34] whine about the place. We're here to
[42:37] recognize that we're only transient.
[42:40] We're just moving through. We don't want
[42:43] to get too uh too rooted down. We don't
[42:46] want to get too uh you know what I mean,
[42:49] too close to anything. We want to be
[42:52] able to hold things loosely because
[42:55] we're just traveling through.
[42:59] &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham said and identified
[43:01] Christ of all ages. He said the the
[43:03] greatest marker of villains in the age
[43:06] in the world that we live in is a false
[43:08] light in this hour that we're living in
[43:12] trying to put us back under some kind of
[43:15] creed and things when we're when we're
[43:18] living epistles
[43:19] &gt;&gt; or otherwise we are epistles that's
[43:22] living
[43:22] &gt;&gt; that's been written and now living out
[43:25] the word of God as he promised in the
[43:27] hour. That's why Jesus said you are the
[43:30] light of the world.
[43:32] &gt;&gt; He said he was the light of the world.
[43:34] And a revelation says of the bride of
[43:36] the new Jerusalem and her light. Her
[43:39] light was it was a marvelous light.
[43:43] &gt;&gt; It's a word light.
[43:45] &gt;&gt; It's not a creed light.
[43:47] &gt;&gt; It's not just a doctrine light.
[43:49] &gt;&gt; It's not just I believe light. It's what
[43:52] he has said and what he has confirmed.
[43:54] It's a it's a living light. And we are
[43:57] epistles written that's been living out.
[44:01] Now Isaiah said to proclaim the
[44:04] acceptable year of the Lord and the day
[44:06] of vengeance of our God.
[44:10] And Ephesians said to the praise of the
[44:13] glory of his grace wherein he hath made
[44:15] us accepted in the in the beloved. He
[44:19] said in to preach the acceptable year of
[44:22] the Lord. and he closed the book like
[44:24] we've had we've had 2,000 years now over
[44:28] 2,000 years or thereabouts of being
[44:32] accepted.
[44:34] Oh, I I I want to say also
[44:38] where uh where we read out of out of
[44:41] Malachi that he shall turn the heart of
[44:43] the fathers to the children and the
[44:46] heart of the children to their fathers.
[44:48] It's almost a paradox because that is
[44:50] happening turning the heart of the
[44:52] children back to the fathers right in a
[44:55] day where it says be I will send you
[44:58] Elijah the prophet before the coming of
[45:00] the great and dreadful day. If this is
[45:03] true if if this is a time and we are a
[45:06] people having our hearts turned back to
[45:09] the faith of our fathers the rest of the
[45:12] verse also must be true hold true that
[45:15] it is a dreadful day.
[45:19] It's not just an average day. We can
[45:21] talk about, you know, Luther's time and
[45:23] all that. That wasn't the dreadful day.
[45:25] &gt;&gt; The dreadful day is associated with a
[45:28] message turning the hearts of the
[45:30] children back to the fathers. This is a
[45:34] dreadful day because it's under the
[45:37] actually under the judgment of almighty
[45:39] God because God has already sentenced
[45:41] it.
[45:43] I looked in the Bible and my mind went
[45:46] sweeping over the scriptures and
[45:48] different accounts that I I I recall of
[45:52] God's dealings with his people and you
[45:54] know uh they went away from God and God
[45:59] allowed them to go into captivity.
[46:02] He allowed them to be slaves. He allowed
[46:06] them. Look at the children of Israel.
[46:09] Went out of that slavery, went out of
[46:12] that terrible bondage of Egypt and were
[46:14] not far distant when they were hankering
[46:17] and yearning to go back.
[46:19] &gt;&gt; Do you know why? It just didn't seem
[46:22] that bad.
[46:24] &gt;&gt; It was terrible, but it didn't seem that
[46:26] bad. And that is the way, you know, we
[46:30] don't want to get accustomed
[46:32] &gt;&gt; to the environment. Amen.
[46:34] &gt;&gt; The environment is a judged environment.
[46:39] &gt;&gt; The environment is a day of vengeance of
[46:43] our God. Not just a day of vengeance,
[46:45] but a day of vengeance of our God. We
[46:47] don't want to become comfortable
[46:50] &gt;&gt; with a judgment with a a generation that
[46:53] is under the indictment
[46:56] &gt;&gt; of Almighty God. We ought to be able to
[46:58] hear in our ears. I indict this
[47:01] generation. We might get accustomed to
[47:03] the thump thump and the boom boom and
[47:05] the nakedness on the street and all of
[47:07] these things. We get accustomed to it
[47:09] because we say it all the time and we're
[47:11] prone to become accustomed to it. But
[47:13] when you say it, you want to just hear
[47:15] those words. I indict this generation.
[47:18] You see a church on every corner and
[47:20] there a little sign out there and all
[47:21] the rest of it, but in behind that nice
[47:23] sign and in behind that nice
[47:25] landscaping, in behind that nice
[47:27] building is a creed, is a doctrine
[47:30] that's damning souls.
[47:35] &gt;&gt; Is it true?
[47:37] &gt;&gt; Thus, it's a day of vengeance of our
[47:39] God. And that's what God sees.
[47:42] &gt;&gt; And that's why God has taken that
[47:44] position. Amen.
[47:46] &gt;&gt; That's why God has spoken it that way.
[47:59] &gt;&gt; He closed the book when he said he
[48:02] claimed to proclaim the acceptable year
[48:04] of the Lord. and he closed the book
[48:08] because
[48:10] this was the this was the time now when
[48:13] favor and good will and grace and they
[48:17] says when we beheld him full of grace
[48:20] and truth this was that was that era and
[48:24] that's what was going to happen pouring
[48:26] out of grace and truth and mercy and the
[48:31] door was opening and the Bible says uh
[48:34] concerning learning out of out of
[48:35] Malachi that before I'll send you Elijah
[48:38] the prophet before the great not
[48:41] dreadful but now the great and I think
[48:43] we need to look at that we just need to
[48:45] look at the great day of the Lord and
[48:48] the acceptable year of the Lord it is a
[48:51] acceptable it was a it's a a a re a
[48:55] desired redemption that's what made it
[48:57] acceptable but it's a great time because
[49:00] it's large in magnitude it is large in
[49:04] numbers number. It's large in great
[49:06] things. It is to grow, to become
[49:09] powerful, to do great things. And you
[49:12] read the book of Acts and you can't you
[49:14] can't go very far in the book of Acts
[49:15] before you'd have to say it was a great
[49:18] day.
[49:19] &gt;&gt; It was a great time. The Holy Spirit
[49:21] came in a great time. Look at the
[49:24] ministry. Look at the ministry that we
[49:26] we have received. Look at the ministry
[49:29] that has taken place under that humble
[49:32] prophet voice.
[49:35] &gt;&gt; Look what's happened.
[49:38] &gt;&gt; It's great.
[49:41] &gt;&gt; I can never never become accustomed to
[49:45] simply
[49:46] relegating and putting it on the average
[49:49] shelf when I hear and I'll never never
[49:53] cease speaking about it. To me it is so
[49:56] marvelous.
[49:57] And today again I I read
[50:01] and I absorbed
[50:03] when he's coming right to the point
[50:06] saying and and I don't know what the
[50:09] rest of the message was or how the
[50:11] people were responding but because it
[50:13] was in 63 I don't expect it was all that
[50:16] well. And he and it was just like a
[50:19] semi-challenge he was making and saying
[50:21] that now we'll just see. would just see
[50:25] and he just started out and he picked it
[50:28] up. He said, "I didn't guess that.
[50:31] Don't do that. I didn't guess that."
[50:35] Imagine people sitting in that very
[50:37] atmosphere and still could have that
[50:40] attitude. How much more even even here
[50:42] we don't have that kind of spectacular
[50:45] demonstration. I say God is doing it. He
[50:48] does it in his own way, but he's not
[50:50] doing it where he raised a one man up
[50:52] for that kind of ministry. And those
[50:54] that tried to duplicate that got
[50:56] followers after themselves and it became
[50:59] a personality thing. We're not following
[51:01] a personality. We're following the word
[51:03] that came out of that mouth. Do you
[51:05] accept that?
[51:08] &gt;&gt; So then he took spoke to the woman
[51:09] directly
[51:11] said, "You you got a dark shadows
[51:14] falling you and you got cancer and you
[51:16] got cancer in both breasts.
[51:18] And furthermore, you didn't come from
[51:20] here. You didn't come from this city.
[51:22] You've come from a cold place. You've
[51:24] come from Colorado and your name is such
[51:28] and such and told her name.
[51:32] I'll never I can never take that and put
[51:34] that up on a shelf and just say that's
[51:36] ordinary.
[51:38] &gt;&gt; I say that's this age of grace
[51:42] &gt;&gt; is going out on the most unusual
[51:47] greatness
[51:49] &gt;&gt; magn magnificent
[51:51] &gt;&gt; ministry. And to think that I got called
[51:53] under that, you got called under that.
[51:55] And we ought to be the most thankful
[51:56] people in the world. We got called under
[51:59] that,
[52:00] &gt;&gt; under the consummation, under the at the
[52:03] climax of it.
[52:06] &gt;&gt; And the reason God did that is because
[52:08] there had to be warning before judgment.
[52:12] &gt;&gt; We come right under that warning
[52:14] ministry. And what comes right on right
[52:17] follows right after it follows right
[52:20] immediately after it the day of
[52:21] vengeance. And we most of most of us
[52:24] here came right up in that time. We're
[52:28] living in the day of vengeance. But
[52:31] Satan, here's my message now. Satan has
[52:34] been so cunning so as to make it that it
[52:37] does not appear to be that.
[52:40] &gt;&gt; Does not appear to be indicted. does not
[52:43] appear to be the day of vengeance. Does
[52:45] not appear to be a dreadful day.
[52:55] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[52:59] I think I will just read this quote. I
[53:02] closed on last Sunday with it.
[53:08] We may talk about the vindication of the
[53:10] ministry, but why it was, what it was
[53:13] for. He promised in the last days that
[53:17] the church would grow so close from the
[53:20] days of Luther and justification and
[53:22] Wesley and sanctification, the days of
[53:24] Pentecost and the restoration of the
[53:27] gifts right into the headstone
[53:32] and through that would bring forth the
[53:34] whole body, the resurrection of every
[53:38] believer.
[53:40] Now you know I have my confidence and my
[53:43] faith
[53:46] I got it hooked right into these kind of
[53:49] words.
[53:51] It makes me feel very very
[53:55] I won't say important
[53:59] but it makes me feel as though the time
[54:02] that God has allowed us to live in
[54:05] a time when we have been uh taken and
[54:10] swallowed right up and embraced by a
[54:12] message
[54:14] that's going to bring forth the
[54:15] resurrection
[54:18] that it actually is it says uh that
[54:23] it'll take it right into the headstone
[54:26] and through that would bring forth the
[54:28] whole body the resurrection of every
[54:30] believer
[54:34] because I've read this many times and
[54:35] perhaps you have not
[54:38] in proving his word
[54:41] and if you want to mark it down it's
[54:44] paragraph 235
[54:47] and he said that you'll remember this
[54:48] from Sunday. That was not Jesus talking
[54:50] to Abraham that could discern the
[54:53] thoughts of Sarah's mind behind him.
[54:56] That was not Jesus. He'd not yet been
[54:58] born. But it was a man in human flesh
[55:02] that Abraham called Elohim.
[55:05] Elohim the great Almighty. And Jesus
[55:08] said, "As I was, as it was in the days
[55:11] of Sodom, now watch close. In the days
[55:13] of Sodom, so will it be in the coming of
[55:16] the Son of Man. when the son of man is
[55:20] being revealed. So that's been that's
[55:23] taken place.
[55:25] Not no more as a church, not no more,
[55:29] but the bride's called. In that day, the
[55:32] son of man will be revealed.
[55:35] That's the same time as the bride has
[55:37] been called. In that day, the son of man
[55:38] will be revealed. And he asked the
[55:41] question, what? to join the church to
[55:45] the head. Unite the marriage of the
[55:49] bride. The bridegroom,
[55:52] the bridegroom call will come right
[55:55] through this. Don't we talk about a
[55:58] ministry, people talk about brother
[55:59] Brandham's ministry, etc. I just want
[56:02] you to lay that aside for a moment and
[56:04] forget all of that. forget of all that
[56:06] you've ever heard and known and just
[56:08] kept this one line that says that the
[56:11] bridegroom call, the bridegroom call
[56:14] will come right through this. He's
[56:18] described the ministry. He said now the
[56:20] bridegroom call will come right through
[56:23] this when the son of man will come down
[56:27] and come in human flesh to unite the
[56:30] true together. That's the whole purpose
[56:34] of the ministry. And furthermore, I will
[56:36] say that is really the summon substance
[56:40] of the reason God ever called you into
[56:44] this word
[56:47] &gt;&gt; to unite you,
[56:50] unite you into Christ, to unite the two
[56:54] together.
[56:56] He said, "See, it's the son of it's the
[56:58] son of man, Jesus Christ will come down
[57:01] in human flesh among us and will make
[57:04] his and will make his word so real that
[57:08] it'll unite the church and him as one,
[57:12] the bride." And then she'll go home to
[57:15] the wedding supper. She's already
[57:18] united.
[57:19] &gt;&gt; And we go to the wedding supper, not to
[57:22] the marriage. She's already united
[57:25] because he came right through this. And
[57:27] what was coming through that was the
[57:29] bridegroom call. So some saw miracles
[57:32] and some wanted healings and some wanted
[57:34] this and some they they simply wanted
[57:37] they laid hold of something that maybe
[57:40] brother Brandham said that kind of he
[57:42] talked about the oneness of the Godhead.
[57:43] They said, "Oh yeah, we're oneness. We
[57:45] believe that all the time." That wasn't
[57:47] it at all.
[57:48] &gt;&gt; That wasn't it at all. that was only a
[57:50] part of the overall message and they get
[57:53] a hold of that and just run off with it.
[57:55] He may talk about gifts and they'd run
[57:57] off with that. He talk about maybe
[57:59] baptism in Jesus' name. Brother Brandon
[58:01] wasn't the first person to baptize the
[58:03] name of the Lord Jesus Christ.
[58:05] &gt;&gt; Multitudes did that. I knew people long
[58:07] before I knew the message. In fact, this
[58:09] debated and argued with me that had to
[58:11] be in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ,
[58:13] but I didn't have any revelation about
[58:14] it. So there were people that were doing
[58:16] it doing it before, but they didn't have
[58:18] they still had a denominational seed.
[58:21] &gt;&gt; They still had a denominational seed. It
[58:23] was not it was not some unique or or
[58:27] revelation that God had had just uh had
[58:30] had set in the form of a message.
[58:38] Then he said also that the true bride
[58:40] will be made up of thousands times
[58:42] thousands of people. But it will be the
[58:45] elect out of every church age. Every
[58:48] time a message went forth and the people
[58:50] believed it, accepted it all,
[58:54] accepted it in all the light it was when
[58:57] they were when they were sealed away
[59:00] until the day of redemption. And so the
[59:02] bride is made up of brother Brandham
[59:04] experience going beyond the curtain of
[59:05] time. He said there were thousands times
[59:08] thousands which are millions of people.
[59:10] He said one place it looked like
[59:11] millions
[59:12] &gt;&gt; that were there and that was just from
[59:14] his age.
[59:15] &gt;&gt; These were his people.
[59:18] &gt;&gt; The angel said these are your people
[59:20] these Brandhams. No these are people
[59:22] that
[59:24] these are your converts to Christ. Now,
[59:26] what about the bride through all the
[59:28] ages?
[59:30] &gt;&gt; Just multitudes and multitudes of
[59:32] people.
[59:35] &gt;&gt; So, that's what the message has come to
[59:37] do in our time. Now,
[59:40] but now both the day of vengeance, I
[59:43] just want to do the little turn now.
[59:45] Both the day of vengeance and the
[59:48] dreadful day are upon us.
[59:53] I'm I'm going to say some things. I want
[59:55] to stay close to my note because these
[59:57] are notes that I just have come out of
[1:00:00] my heart as of in the last, you know,
[1:00:04] day or two.
[1:00:07] Satan has refined bondage
[1:00:13] in Satan's Eden. He's refined bondage
[1:00:17] till it doesn't seem to be bondage.
[1:00:25] We're actually in a generation of
[1:00:27] slavery.
[1:00:30] &gt;&gt; People are enslaved to material things.
[1:00:32] They're enslaved to enslaved to their
[1:00:35] job. They're enslaved to all kinds of
[1:00:37] things.
[1:00:39] They're enslaved to we can talk about
[1:00:41] sports. They can talk about religion.
[1:00:45] &gt;&gt; It's a generation of slaves.
[1:00:48] &gt;&gt; Now, you know, I'm glad that I'm
[1:00:50] speaking to a group of people tonight
[1:00:53] that that I think for the most part
[1:00:56] believe that and see that.
[1:00:58] &gt;&gt; But if you would go and speak to them,
[1:01:01] they don't feel that they're in slavery.
[1:01:04] They don't feel that way. Why? Because
[1:01:07] Satan has refined the bondage.
[1:01:12] &gt;&gt; They don't feel like they're in darkness
[1:01:14] because Satan has produced artificial
[1:01:16] lights.
[1:01:20] They don't feel that they're indicted.
[1:01:22] What are you talking about?
[1:01:25] I'm I've got things going for me. I've
[1:01:28] got this is a you know I I feel good
[1:01:32] today.
[1:01:37] Dreadful,
[1:01:40] fearful
[1:01:42] to be afraid
[1:01:44] and to stand in awe. Vengeance.
[1:01:47] vengeance by God.
[1:01:50] God has taken vengeance. And there are
[1:01:52] times when he went to avenge
[1:01:56] himself, but the people didn't realize
[1:01:59] it. And this is what I want you to see.
[1:02:01] I probably don't have have time tonight,
[1:02:04] so I won't I won't approach it, but
[1:02:07] there's a very very strange very very
[1:02:10] strange scripture, and I've been wanting
[1:02:13] to preach on it. I've touched on it some
[1:02:16] months ago,
[1:02:18] but it really takes some I think it
[1:02:20] takes a spiritual atmosphere and a
[1:02:23] special
[1:02:25] uh just a special moment.
[1:02:28] But even even here when I went into the
[1:02:32] uh into the Hebrew regarding vengeance,
[1:02:36] it said vengeance by God, by Samson, and
[1:02:40] by the enemies of Judah.
[1:02:45] God coming to avenge himself through
[1:02:49] Samson was very very rare, very strange.
[1:02:53] And the Bible says he saw a woman of
[1:02:56] Timnath. How many remember I ever
[1:02:58] mentioned this to you? He saw a woman of
[1:03:00] Timnath
[1:03:03] of the Philistines
[1:03:06] and he desired her and he come back to
[1:03:09] his parents and said, "Get me this woman
[1:03:12] for my wife."
[1:03:14] They were distressed.
[1:03:17] What are you talking about Hebrew
[1:03:22] man with? You've never had a razor touch
[1:03:25] your head. You're a Nazerite.
[1:03:27] What are you talking about taking a
[1:03:30] woman of the Philistines
[1:03:32] as a wife?
[1:03:35] He said, "But she pleases me. Get her.
[1:03:38] Get her." And he wouldn't give up on it.
[1:03:42] And the Bible says that his mother and
[1:03:44] his father did not know that God was
[1:03:50] seeking to avenge himself to the
[1:03:54] Philistines.
[1:03:57] such a strange way
[1:03:59] &gt;&gt; to avenge himself.
[1:04:05] &gt;&gt; This is why it takes a spiritual mind.
[1:04:09] You really want to get into it into the
[1:04:11] depth of it.
[1:04:13] That word to avenge
[1:04:16] it is like
[1:04:18] it is like a a man that is driven by a
[1:04:23] sexual passion.
[1:04:27] and that there's no turning back. He's
[1:04:30] going to he's going to achieve this
[1:04:33] goal. And the Bible says the Bible says
[1:04:36] it was God God was going to avenge. He
[1:04:40] had his eyes set on avenging himself for
[1:04:44] what the Philistines have done to
[1:04:46] Israel. But Israel didn't realize it.
[1:04:48] They didn't realize it. Is what I'm
[1:04:50] saying to you friends is in a day of
[1:04:52] vengeance. God has set on a course.
[1:04:56] &gt;&gt; He has set on a course to destroy the
[1:04:59] wickedness of this world.
[1:05:02] &gt;&gt; We have become numb. We hear of the
[1:05:05] bombing and the slaughter and the
[1:05:07] killing and the raping and the all of
[1:05:09] these things. We become numb because
[1:05:11] we've been right in this environment.
[1:05:13] But let us not lose sight of God's goal.
[1:05:17] &gt;&gt; He's going to destroy it for this
[1:05:19] wickedness.
[1:05:20] &gt;&gt; And it needs to be said. It needs to be
[1:05:23] said. We need to have our our senses
[1:05:26] really sharpened and honed to realize
[1:05:30] that the things that we accept, God
[1:05:32] hates.
[1:05:34] [Applause]
[1:05:36] &gt;&gt; The things we become accustomed to, God
[1:05:38] hates it.
[1:05:40] &gt;&gt; The scripture says of Jesus that he
[1:05:42] loved righteousness and and conjunction
[1:05:46] word hated iniquity.
[1:05:49] &gt;&gt; Both of those things. We become very
[1:05:51] very accustomed to it.
[1:05:54] &gt;&gt; We see it everywhere. We hear it
[1:05:56] everywhere.
[1:05:57] &gt;&gt; We view it everywhere.
[1:05:59] &gt;&gt; And it's just like it's permeating you.
[1:06:02] It's it's like the kingdom of darkness
[1:06:04] and the kingdom of of of Satan just
[1:06:07] imposing this on the people on the
[1:06:10] people until until we we ourselves don't
[1:06:14] see it and view it as God's word has
[1:06:16] said it. And then we may hear a message.
[1:06:18] And we were just talking about this
[1:06:20] driving here to church and my wife had
[1:06:22] just was listening this afternoon to
[1:06:24] wave a true prophet. She said it just he
[1:06:27] said he just blasted just on and on
[1:06:32] blasted this denomination world. I said,
[1:06:34] "Well, you don't know what I'm speaking
[1:06:35] on tonight
[1:06:38] because it's a false light."
[1:06:40] &gt;&gt; Had to cry out against it. and the way
[1:06:43] the women wear and and and you go back,
[1:06:48] the Bible says that when God would turn
[1:06:51] the people and Israel would would
[1:06:54] disobey God and go after other gods and
[1:06:57] then God would turn his back on them.
[1:06:59] They didn't realize it. They didn't
[1:07:01] realize that they were in a state of
[1:07:03] going into bondage. Do you know when
[1:07:05] they went into bondage? We talk about
[1:07:06] Babylon. Babylon. They went into the
[1:07:09] bondage of Babylon. They set up
[1:07:11] businesses. They succeeded. They
[1:07:13] prospered. They learned a new language.
[1:07:16] They became completely absorbed and and
[1:07:19] assimilated in Babylon to when they were
[1:07:22] finally delivered. All of the Jews
[1:07:25] didn't come home.
[1:07:27] &gt;&gt; They said, "We're fine in this bondage.
[1:07:29] This bondage is okay.
[1:07:31] &gt;&gt; This isn't a bad country. This isn't a
[1:07:33] bad place. We've prospered. We've done
[1:07:36] all right." But they didn't see it how
[1:07:38] God saw it.
[1:07:39] We don't want to lose sight of how God
[1:07:41] saves this generation.
[1:07:46] &gt;&gt; Live our lives, do our things, work our
[1:07:49] jobs. That's what we need to do. But
[1:07:50] don't lose sight of how God sees it.
[1:07:53] Amen.
[1:07:58] &gt;&gt; In the scripture
[1:08:00] says, "And it came to pass
[1:08:03] uh when the judge was dead that they
[1:08:06] returned and corrupted themselves." Now,
[1:08:09] you see, this is what I want you to see.
[1:08:11] It isn't that God comes down with fury
[1:08:14] upon the people. When he sees people and
[1:08:17] they go after other gods or they go
[1:08:18] after the world or whatever more, you
[1:08:20] know what? God just kind of stands back.
[1:08:24] And the Bible says he let them go their
[1:08:27] own ways.
[1:08:29] He let them be a law to themselves.
[1:08:32] That's the way you want to go. It's like
[1:08:33] a father, a mother, parents to a child.
[1:08:38] All right? That's what you want to do.
[1:08:42] Fine. You go your own way. You'll find
[1:08:46] out after a while. It's not just exactly
[1:08:49] how you view it.
[1:08:54] And the Bible says they corrupted
[1:08:57] themselves.
[1:08:59] Brother Brandham talks is it's not the,
[1:09:03] you know, it's not the bruise on the
[1:09:05] apple or whatever from the outside, but
[1:09:07] it's the worm from within
[1:09:10] that makes it rotten. And so they
[1:09:13] corrupted themselves more than their
[1:09:16] fathers in following other gods to serve
[1:09:19] them and to bow down unto them. They
[1:09:23] ceased not from their own doings nor
[1:09:25] from their stubborn way. and the anger
[1:09:28] of the Lord. The reason I'm bringing
[1:09:30] this to you is not so much to the
[1:09:32] congregation present, but that the
[1:09:34] congregation present and the
[1:09:35] congregation that's is streaming that
[1:09:38] they might that we might have our vision
[1:09:42] focused that we might see things as God
[1:09:46] sees it.
[1:09:48] &gt;&gt; And I think it's essential.
[1:09:50] &gt;&gt; I think it's important. I think it's
[1:09:52] important as children in a home as they
[1:09:54] grow up that they begin to see things as
[1:09:56] the parents see it.
[1:09:58] &gt;&gt; The the vision of the parents needs to
[1:10:00] be you know uh uh brought into the view
[1:10:04] of the children so the children can see
[1:10:07] as the parents see. I'm speaking now
[1:10:10] that parents are are are real godly
[1:10:14] believers.
[1:10:15] And the Bible says, "And the anger of
[1:10:17] the Lord was hot against Israel. And he
[1:10:19] said, because that this people hath
[1:10:21] transgressed my covenant, which I
[1:10:23] commanded their fathers, and have
[1:10:26] hearkened have not hearkened unto my
[1:10:28] voice, I also will not henceforth drive
[1:10:32] out from before them the nations other
[1:10:35] of nations which Joshua left when he
[1:10:38] died." There were several nations that
[1:10:41] Joshua left when he died. And God said
[1:10:44] he was going to leave them to try the
[1:10:46] people. And now the people turned away
[1:10:50] from God. And so God said, "I'm going to
[1:10:53] leave them here.
[1:10:55] &gt;&gt; I'm going to leave these nations here,
[1:10:58] and I will also not henceforth drive out
[1:11:00] any of these nations." And and he says,
[1:11:03] "And through them I may prove Israel
[1:11:08] whether they will keep the word and the
[1:11:11] way of the Lord to walk therein as their
[1:11:13] fathers did keep it or not." Therefore
[1:11:16] the Lord left those nations without
[1:11:19] driving them out hastily. Neither
[1:11:22] delivered he them into the hand of
[1:11:26] Joshua.
[1:11:29] Peter says,
[1:11:31] "But these," speaking of of of of some,
[1:11:34] he said, "But these as natural brute
[1:11:36] beasts made to be taken and destroyed
[1:11:40] speak evil of the things that are that
[1:11:42] they understand not and shall utterly
[1:11:45] perish in their own corruption." It's
[1:11:49] not God. I don't want you to say, we
[1:11:50] talk about the day of vengeance. I don't
[1:11:52] want you to think that God is just
[1:11:54] pouring out wrath upon the earth.
[1:11:57] The vengeance that I really want you to
[1:11:59] see is that God draws back.
[1:12:04] &gt;&gt; And I would too if I were God. If I send
[1:12:08] the very best I could, if I would send
[1:12:10] the actual duplicate ministry of Jesus
[1:12:13] Christ and reveal the son of man and do
[1:12:16] the same works
[1:12:19] &gt;&gt; and the people refuse to hear,
[1:12:22] &gt;&gt; I draw back too and say, "Let you wallow
[1:12:25] in your own sin.
[1:12:27] &gt;&gt; Let your wallow have what you want."
[1:12:29] Remember that the children of Israel
[1:12:31] came out and the Bible says,
[1:12:34] see if I can read it here
[1:12:40] in Psalms. I have quite a bit of
[1:12:42] scripture to read. You're listening good
[1:12:44] in in Psalms in 78. I'm reading from
[1:12:47] verse 18. And and here's David now. He's
[1:12:51] rehearsing about the children of Israel.
[1:12:54] And he's a king. He's rehearsing what
[1:12:56] happened to them. And they tempted God
[1:12:58] in their heart by asking me for their
[1:13:01] lust or for their desire. Yay, they
[1:13:03] spake against God. They said, "Can God
[1:13:06] furnish a table in the wilderness?
[1:13:08] Behold, he smoked the rock that waters
[1:13:11] gushed out, and the streams overflowed.
[1:13:14] Can he give bread also? Can he provide
[1:13:16] flesh for this people?" Therefore, the
[1:13:19] Lord heard this.
[1:13:21] &gt;&gt; They were saying it, but the Lord heard
[1:13:22] it. Amen.
[1:13:24] &gt;&gt; And the Lord heard it and he was wroth.
[1:13:26] And so a fire was kindled against Jacob
[1:13:29] and the anger also came up against
[1:13:32] Israel. Now watch how a fire was
[1:13:34] kindled. Watch how it happened.
[1:13:38] They asked for flesh and God gave it to
[1:13:40] them. That's how it happened.
[1:13:44] And because they believed not in God,
[1:13:46] and trusted not in his salvation, though
[1:13:49] he had though he had commanded the
[1:13:51] clouds from above, and opened the doors
[1:13:54] of heaven, and rained down mana upon
[1:13:56] them to eat, and had given them the corn
[1:13:59] of heaven, and man did eat angels food.
[1:14:03] He sent them meat to the full. He caused
[1:14:07] an east wind to blow in heaven. Hey,
[1:14:10] this is this is God of wrath.
[1:14:14] I can hear by your silence. You don't
[1:14:16] know what I'm talking about.
[1:14:18] &gt;&gt; This is a God of wrath. This is how it's
[1:14:21] happening.
[1:14:24] &gt;&gt; He's giving them what they want.
[1:14:27] &gt;&gt; If you hanker and yearn and whine and
[1:14:30] whatever more, God will give it to you.
[1:14:32] &gt;&gt; It may not be the very best thing for
[1:14:34] you, but if you want it and you crave
[1:14:36] for it, God will give it to you. And
[1:14:38] sometimes people go their own direction
[1:14:40] and they find that they they become
[1:14:42] entangled and then and snared and and
[1:14:45] changed bond, you know, it's such a they
[1:14:48] get into bonds
[1:14:50] because they've gone their own
[1:14:52] direction.
[1:14:54] &gt;&gt; And he says, "And he caused the east
[1:14:56] wind to blow from heaven and by his
[1:14:58] power he brought in the south wind and
[1:15:01] he rained he reigned flesh also upon
[1:15:04] him." This is this is God's
[1:15:07] filled with displeasure
[1:15:10] and he's given them mana and he's given
[1:15:12] them water and he's given them all these
[1:15:13] things but they said uh
[1:15:17] you know can God give us a table in the
[1:15:19] wilderness and God heard it he heard it
[1:15:24] and he rained flesh upon them as dust
[1:15:27] and feathered fowls like as the sand of
[1:15:30] the sea and he let it fall in the midst
[1:15:33] of their camp around about their
[1:15:35] habitations ations. So they did eat and
[1:15:38] they were filled and he gave them their
[1:15:41] own desire.
[1:15:44] He gave them their own desire.
[1:15:48] Th this was actually God's anger was
[1:15:51] being displayed. He gave them their own
[1:15:54] desire because their desire sometimes
[1:15:57] the things that we crave for aren't all
[1:15:59] that good for us.
[1:16:02] It's not really the best,
[1:16:04] &gt;&gt; but we crave for it and we yearn for it
[1:16:07] and we pull for it and we whine for it
[1:16:09] and and we complain for it and we just
[1:16:11] are so bent on a certain direction.
[1:16:13] Finally, God says, "Okay,
[1:16:15] that's what you want. I'll give it to
[1:16:17] you."
[1:16:20] Sometimes people who desired success,
[1:16:26] success isn't always the best thing. Few
[1:16:29] people can handle success.
[1:16:32] &gt;&gt; Success can be a very very deceptive
[1:16:35] thing.
[1:16:36] &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham says of a minister, now
[1:16:38] I'm coming to the pulpit. Says of a
[1:16:41] minister,
[1:16:42] God gives him a good ministry
[1:16:46] gives him success.
[1:16:49] Congregation of people.
[1:16:51] He's loved.
[1:16:53] He's just really, you know, he finds a
[1:16:56] place in their hearts. And he says and
[1:16:59] he he has a ministry and he has a place
[1:17:01] and he he he's loved by the people and
[1:17:03] he gets a feeling that he's he's has
[1:17:07] almost immunity.
[1:17:09] &gt;&gt; He can almost do anything he says and
[1:17:12] get away with it.
[1:17:16] What was it? Success. There isn't any
[1:17:19] minister stand behind the pulpit and
[1:17:21] wants to be a failure.
[1:17:23] &gt;&gt; He wants to, you know, succeed in what
[1:17:25] he's attempting to do. He wants to get
[1:17:27] behind the pulpit even in preaching a
[1:17:29] service. He wants to get the message
[1:17:30] across what's in his heart. He wants to
[1:17:32] get it across.
[1:17:35] I've talked to ministers
[1:17:38] many many in my day
[1:17:42] and they they were able to handle the
[1:17:44] growth. They were able to handle the you
[1:17:47] know the the church as God blessed it.
[1:17:50] But then you know one I spoke to and he
[1:17:54] just said I I was so close to the people
[1:17:56] so close and then finally when I
[1:17:58] couldn't devote the same kind of time he
[1:18:00] said I think the people became unhappy
[1:18:02] and and most of them left me and that
[1:18:04] that particular brother had a nervous
[1:18:06] breakdown he couldn't handle he could
[1:18:08] handle the success but he couldn't
[1:18:10] handle
[1:18:11] the effect of it and I and the effect it
[1:18:14] had on him. I don't know if I'd be able
[1:18:16] to handle it either. It was very very
[1:18:19] hard for him. And so uh the Bible says
[1:18:24] here that he gave them their desire and
[1:18:27] they were not he said they were not in
[1:18:29] stranged from their lust. Even that
[1:18:32] didn't it strains them from their lust
[1:18:34] or from their desire.
[1:18:36] But while their meat was yet in their
[1:18:38] mouths, while they still had the meat in
[1:18:41] their mouth, of the thing they so
[1:18:44] yearned for and called for and
[1:18:46] complained that they thought God
[1:18:47] couldn't do it, but while the meat was
[1:18:49] still in their mouth, the wrath of God
[1:18:51] came upon them and slew the fattest of
[1:18:53] them and smoked down the chosen men of
[1:18:56] Israel. For all this they sinned still.
[1:19:00] &gt;&gt; Isn't this incredible?
[1:19:03] &gt;&gt; Isn't this incredible?
[1:19:07] and believed not for his wondrous works.
[1:19:10] Therefore their days did did he consume
[1:19:13] in vanity and their years in trouble
[1:19:16] when he slew them. Then they then they
[1:19:19] sought him and they returned and
[1:19:22] inquired early after God and they
[1:19:26] remembered that God was their rock and
[1:19:29] the high God their redeemer.
[1:19:32] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:19:32] &gt;&gt; God achieves his purpose. God achieves
[1:19:35] his end. But I say, why do people have
[1:19:39] to go through that?
[1:19:42] &gt;&gt; Why do they have to go through that?
[1:19:48] &gt;&gt; And here was the message. My wife was
[1:19:50] listening rather a message that I was
[1:19:53] reading earlier today about Amos. And
[1:19:55] Amos is the prophet that is in the way
[1:19:57] of a true prophet. He said he lived to
[1:20:00] see his prophecy. Do we have a few more
[1:20:02] minutes? Amen.
[1:20:03] &gt;&gt; I'm going I'm not going to keep you
[1:20:04] long. He lived to see his prophecy. But
[1:20:07] when Amos spoke of that city, how it was
[1:20:10] going to happen, how God was going to
[1:20:14] cause the Syrians to come in and take
[1:20:16] them over and so forth like that, and
[1:20:18] how their corruption would eat them up,
[1:20:20] how their corruption would eat them up.
[1:20:23] He said, "Why?" I believe he said if
[1:20:25] it's right now, I'm looking down here
[1:20:27] upon the scripture. And if I've got this
[1:20:30] counted right, it's around 50 years
[1:20:32] after Amos prophesied. And now, what do
[1:20:35] you think? A whole generation passed
[1:20:38] before Amos's prophecy came to pass. And
[1:20:42] if you read it over, it tells you. And
[1:20:44] it happened just exactly word by word
[1:20:48] what he said. John saw the book of
[1:20:50] Revelation. It never happened in his
[1:20:52] day. But we we see it coming to pass
[1:20:55] just exactly. Daniel prophesied in his
[1:20:58] day of of his day and all down through.
[1:21:01] He never lived to say it. He said, "Go
[1:21:04] your way, Daniel. Shut up the book and
[1:21:06] close the book and you'll sleep in your
[1:21:08] lot." But uh but at the at that day
[1:21:12] you'll stand. He said, "Now you don't
[1:21:14] always God strikes as soon as he
[1:21:17] prophesies." God doesn't always strike
[1:21:19] as soon as he prophesies. Amos says,
[1:21:21] "Prophesize. I prophecy I said 50 years
[1:21:23] later it came to pass and how many
[1:21:26] things that the messenger has spoken
[1:21:30] hasn't come to pass. We've just seen the
[1:21:32] world go on. We've seen things just you
[1:21:35] know uh uh shall we say develop and
[1:21:38] evolve and we've saw all the advancement
[1:21:41] and all the scientific achievements and
[1:21:44] all the things and even in the message
[1:21:46] we've seen what's been happening. We're
[1:21:47] a part of it and I think person just has
[1:21:49] to go on and put their best efforts to
[1:21:51] it and do everything we can while God
[1:21:54] gives us life and God gives us strength
[1:21:56] but never become accustomed to the fact
[1:21:58] of what's been prophesied shall surely
[1:22:01] come to pass.
[1:22:03] &gt;&gt; And what's been spoken surely how the
[1:22:06] prophet of God described this generation
[1:22:09] it is that is the condition that God
[1:22:12] sees it in.
[1:22:16] Amen.
[1:22:21] &gt;&gt; A minister hearing brother Brandham
[1:22:24] speak and this is in the message here ye
[1:22:26] him minister was telling brother
[1:22:28] Brandham
[1:22:30] uh and he said brother Brandham do you
[1:22:32] know why your ministry is not the
[1:22:35] greatest ministry in America today
[1:22:39] and I said I don't care what it is in
[1:22:41] America. I want to know what it is in
[1:22:44] the books in heaven
[1:22:48] &gt;&gt; up there. What it is there. That's what
[1:22:51] he want to know. And this man said, this
[1:22:54] minister said, well, I'll tell you, it's
[1:22:56] because you rebuke
[1:22:59] the people in such a way and said, you
[1:23:02] ball them out and it hurts them. He
[1:23:05] said, if you just stop doing that, says
[1:23:08] then your ministry would grow and so
[1:23:10] forth. And I said, "Sir,
[1:23:14] let me tell you something. When it comes
[1:23:16] to a place that I have to compromise on
[1:23:19] the word of God, then I'll stop and
[1:23:21] leave the field and let God call
[1:23:24] somebody else to do it." How can you
[1:23:26] hold your peace? And that was his
[1:23:28] question. How can you hold your peace?
[1:23:30] When we see when we when I see the
[1:23:33] things that our young people are
[1:23:34] subjected to when I see the things that
[1:23:37] are ex that we're exposed to whether it
[1:23:41] be whether it be newspaper or whether it
[1:23:43] be internet or whether it be whatever
[1:23:46] whatever it is whether it be by music or
[1:23:49] whether it be by you know just uh uh the
[1:23:52] the your peers or your contact and and
[1:23:56] the brothers and the sisters you know
[1:23:58] it's just it's it's indescribable and I
[1:24:01] do not have the words. I do not have the
[1:24:03] vocabulary but the atmosphere that the
[1:24:07] Satan has so permeated. This is his Eden
[1:24:12] &gt;&gt; and he permeates every aspect of life
[1:24:16] trying to press and trying to permeate
[1:24:18] trying to affect our minds or to cause
[1:24:20] us to think in a certain a certain
[1:24:22] direction, a certain way to to uh look
[1:24:26] at things a certain way to and and and
[1:24:29] just like Delilah and Samson wore him
[1:24:32] down day after day, day after day until
[1:24:36] finally and if you read the account,
[1:24:38] it's It's really sad because
[1:24:41] he started he started tell her, you
[1:24:44] know, well, if you bind me and he got
[1:24:46] closer and closer and closer until
[1:24:49] finally he got to to his hair and gave
[1:24:52] her the secret.
[1:24:54] This tells me we do have we do have a
[1:24:59] special secret with God. We do have a
[1:25:03] special connection. And there's all
[1:25:06] kinds of people that have enough
[1:25:08] intelligence and sense in this world.
[1:25:11] They see the
[1:25:13] clarity
[1:25:15] of a person's nature. They see the
[1:25:18] integrity that is admirable. They see
[1:25:23] the kind of life and the kind of family.
[1:25:25] Listen friends,
[1:25:27] &gt;&gt; I just tell you, not that I have to tell
[1:25:30] you, but the world is in such a state.
[1:25:34] My grandson, Wesley Ordeal, filled out
[1:25:38] an application quite some time ago to a
[1:25:41] very, very large international
[1:25:43] corporation, Richie Brothers
[1:25:45] Auctioneers. this some years ago, a few
[1:25:48] years ago, he filled out and in that
[1:25:51] application he had to relate about his
[1:25:54] family and all the connections and his
[1:25:57] grandparents or whatever more and his
[1:25:59] brother and his sister and their family
[1:26:02] and his mother and his dad and all that.
[1:26:04] And when the people who are re who are
[1:26:07] actually analyzing and and looking at
[1:26:10] this man's uh uh his background and the
[1:26:13] family and everything, they called him
[1:26:15] in and they essentially didn't believe
[1:26:17] it. They didn't believe it because this
[1:26:20] is just h how do you have a marriage
[1:26:23] hanging together for 30 years and how do
[1:26:25] you have someone else that's married and
[1:26:27] they're not divorced and this one's not
[1:26:29] divorced and that one's not divorced and
[1:26:31] how can you come? It didn't seem real to
[1:26:34] them and they queried him very very
[1:26:36] specifically upon that application and
[1:26:39] found out that everything was true
[1:26:42] &gt;&gt; and offered him the job.
[1:26:52] &gt;&gt; You know, I may be speaking from a
[1:26:53] little different perspective than where
[1:26:54] you sit and the life that you live, but
[1:26:58] I meet a lot of people.
[1:27:00] I I speak to a lot of people. I'm called
[1:27:04] from a lot of different places. And I
[1:27:07] can tell you the world is a very sick
[1:27:10] world.
[1:27:13] &gt;&gt; And I am not speaking from a negative
[1:27:15] position. I'm speaking now from a
[1:27:17] scriptural position. This is what the
[1:27:19] word of God has said. And it shall wax
[1:27:22] worse and worse. Don't look for it to
[1:27:25] get better. It shall wax worse and
[1:27:27] worse. And God shall fold it up like a
[1:27:30] garment and put it away. That's the thus
[1:27:32] says the word of God.
[1:27:34] &gt;&gt; Absolutely.
[1:27:36] &gt;&gt; And I just thought tonight it would be
[1:27:39] essential for us to hear something from
[1:27:41] this direction. We speak of the of of
[1:27:44] the ministry that God has sent, the
[1:27:46] message that God has sent and what that
[1:27:48] has done for us. And that is just
[1:27:49] wonderful. That is glorious and it's all
[1:27:52] true and we spend our time with it. But
[1:27:54] on the other hand, sometimes we become
[1:27:57] and don't don't don't look at me like it
[1:27:59] doesn't happen. We become afflicted
[1:28:02] by the environment and by what it is we
[1:28:05] encounter and it can have such an effect
[1:28:08] upon us sometime. It can it it's it's
[1:28:10] draining. The Bible says that it can be
[1:28:13] weary. It wearies us because you are
[1:28:16] affect I say don't be affected by it.
[1:28:19] That's the way it has to go. And when
[1:28:21] you see those things, say it's a
[1:28:23] generation under the day of vengeance of
[1:28:26] our God.
[1:28:28] &gt;&gt; It's a day of dreadful day. That's what
[1:28:31] God Don't be ashamed to use God's
[1:28:33] language.
[1:28:34] &gt;&gt; Elijah has come.
[1:28:37] &gt;&gt; And our hearts have been turned back to
[1:28:39] the fathers. But it happened in a
[1:28:41] dreadful time.
[1:28:45] &gt;&gt; God, give me words and give me ability
[1:28:48] &gt;&gt; to describe it.
[1:28:50] I was sent this and I'm sent
[1:28:54] uh and I'm just going to be a few
[1:28:55] minutes. I want to read a couple of
[1:28:56] things
[1:28:59] on a recent
[1:29:01] a recent trip I picked up on in the
[1:29:04] airlines at the airport or in the
[1:29:05] airplane. the International Herald
[1:29:08] Tribune
[1:29:09] and I think it's when brother Diddy and
[1:29:12] I were on our way to uh Congo
[1:29:17] and I picked up this and it was the 10th
[1:29:19] anniversary of Princess Diana
[1:29:23] and there was big things going on
[1:29:26] because she is uh
[1:29:28] been so loved by so many people and so
[1:29:32] on.
[1:29:34] And this man wrote, now this is a very
[1:29:36] very highly respected and a very
[1:29:37] conservative paper.
[1:29:41] It's a it's the international herald
[1:29:43] tribune
[1:29:45] and he wrote an article large article.
[1:29:47] I'm not going to read it off, but he
[1:29:50] calls it the blind cult
[1:29:53] of Princess Diana. and in the article
[1:29:57] and he brings it down and narrows it
[1:29:59] down to the beauty cult, the cult of
[1:30:03] beauty.
[1:30:04] And along in there,
[1:30:11] he said, "Consider the power of the
[1:30:14] beauty cult." This man is just an
[1:30:17] unbeliever.
[1:30:20] So I'm speaking to you tonight from the
[1:30:23] scripture perspective and from what the
[1:30:25] messenger has said concerning the
[1:30:27] generation. Now I'm going to read two or
[1:30:29] three articles for you to just to you
[1:30:33] know come to kind of where I'm at and
[1:30:35] get into my mindset. The people of the
[1:30:38] world
[1:30:39] they also identify it but don't have an
[1:30:42] answer.
[1:30:44] &gt;&gt; They don't have the other side. They
[1:30:45] don't have the spiritual side. They
[1:30:47] don't have the scriptural side. They
[1:30:50] have haven't got your advantage.
[1:30:54] &gt;&gt; And so this man says, "Consider the
[1:30:56] power of the beauty cult. America's
[1:31:00] network news, which once was serious,
[1:31:04] employ women whose makeup increasingly
[1:31:07] resembles the thickness of a death
[1:31:09] mask."
[1:31:10] The new NBC News financial reporter and
[1:31:14] he mentions her name is a younger
[1:31:17] version of CNBC's
[1:31:19] Money Honey and he mentions her name and
[1:31:22] is is ugled by the talk show host and he
[1:31:26] mentions another name and others who
[1:31:28] focus on her looks and not on what may
[1:31:31] be inside her head if anything. Cable
[1:31:35] networks employ Barbie doll wannabes who
[1:31:38] are blondes with short skirts and
[1:31:40] apparently little selfish self-respect.
[1:31:44] They are all interchangeable parts,
[1:31:47] virtually indistinguishable from one
[1:31:49] another. Most speak in cliches and have
[1:31:53] trouble at living anything that isn't
[1:31:55] written for them on the teleprompter.
[1:31:58] But the lip gloss and the hair look
[1:32:00] great. They are the fantasies of aging
[1:32:04] male management and middle school boys.
[1:32:07] Or am I being redundant? The Diana cult
[1:32:10] will continue until someone younger with
[1:32:13] a better story replaces her. The public
[1:32:16] always wants a better and younger story.
[1:32:19] And then he goes on to some others and
[1:32:22] he talks about a cults ultimately
[1:32:25] disappoint and the Diana cult will too.
[1:32:28] And Germaine Greet uh is Greer rather
[1:32:32] someone who wrote a book concludes by
[1:32:34] writing that Diana was a desperate woman
[1:32:38] seeking applause and no wonder so many
[1:32:40] still love her because they are seeking
[1:32:43] the same thing. This is a man of the
[1:32:46] world. I said he had quite good insight.
[1:32:51] &gt;&gt; A man by the name of Daryl Scott and
[1:32:53] whoever sent this to me, thank you. the
[1:32:56] father of Rachel Scott, a victim of the
[1:32:58] Coline High School shootings in
[1:33:01] Littleton, Colorado. He was invited to
[1:33:05] address the House Judiciary Committee's
[1:33:09] subcommittee. And what he said to our
[1:33:11] national leaders during his special
[1:33:13] session of Congress was painfully
[1:33:17] truthful.
[1:33:19] They were not prepared for what he was
[1:33:22] to say, nor was it received well. It
[1:33:25] needs to be heard by every parent and
[1:33:27] every teacher, every politician, every
[1:33:29] sociologist, every psychologist, and
[1:33:33] every so-called expert. These courageous
[1:33:36] words spoken by Daryl Scott are
[1:33:39] powerful, penetrating, and deeply
[1:33:41] personal. There's no doubt that God sent
[1:33:44] this man as a voice crying in the
[1:33:46] wilderness. And the following is a
[1:33:48] portion of the transcript.
[1:33:51] Quote, "Since the dawn of creation,
[1:33:54] there has been both good and evil in the
[1:33:56] hearts of men and women, and we all
[1:33:58] contain the seeds of kindness or the
[1:34:01] seeds of violence."
[1:34:03] The death of my wonderful daughter,
[1:34:05] Rachel,
[1:34:06] Rachel Joyce Scott, and the deaths of
[1:34:09] that heroic teacher and the other 11
[1:34:12] children who died must not be in vain.
[1:34:15] Their blood cries out for answers. The
[1:34:19] first recorded act of violence was when
[1:34:21] Cain slew his brother Abel out of the
[1:34:24] field. The villain was not the club he
[1:34:28] used. Neither is it the NCA, the
[1:34:31] National Club Association. The true
[1:34:33] killer was Cain. And the reason for the
[1:34:36] murder only can only be found in Kane's
[1:34:39] heart. In the days that followed the
[1:34:42] Columbine tragedy, I was amazed at how
[1:34:45] quickly fingers began to point at groups
[1:34:49] such as the NRA. I am not a member of
[1:34:52] the NRA. I'm not a hunter. I do not own
[1:34:56] a gun. I am not I am not here to
[1:34:59] represent or defend the NRA because I
[1:35:02] don't believe that they are responsible
[1:35:04] for my my daughter's death. Therefore, I
[1:35:07] do not believe that they need to be
[1:35:09] defended. If I believed they had
[1:35:12] anything to do with Rachel's murder, I
[1:35:14] would be the strongest opponent. I'm
[1:35:16] here today to declare that Columbine was
[1:35:19] not just a tragedy. It was a spiritual
[1:35:22] event that should be forcing us to look
[1:35:24] at where the real blame lies. Much of
[1:35:28] the blame lies here in this room. Much
[1:35:30] of the blame lies by the behind the
[1:35:33] pointing fingers of the accusers
[1:35:35] themselves. I wrote a poem just four
[1:35:38] nights ago that expresses my feelings
[1:35:41] best. This was written way before I knew
[1:35:44] I would be speaking here today. And
[1:35:46] here's what he said.
[1:35:49] Your laws ignore our deepest needs. Your
[1:35:53] words are empty air. You've stripped
[1:35:56] away our heritage. You've outlawed
[1:35:59] simple prayer. Now gunshots fill our
[1:36:02] classrooms and precious children die.
[1:36:06] You seek for answers everywhere and ask
[1:36:09] the reason why. You regulate restrictive
[1:36:12] laws through legislative creed. And yet
[1:36:16] you fail to understand that God is what
[1:36:19] we need.
[1:36:21] &gt;&gt; Men and women are three parts being. We
[1:36:25] all consist of body, mind, and spirit.
[1:36:28] And when we refuse to acknowledge the
[1:36:30] third part of our makeup, we create a
[1:36:32] void that allows evil prejudice and
[1:36:35] hatred to rush in and wreak havoc.
[1:36:39] Spiritual
[1:36:41] presences were present when our
[1:36:43] educational system when our educational
[1:36:47] system for the most uh for most of our
[1:36:49] nation's history, many of our major
[1:36:52] colleges began as theological
[1:36:54] seminaries. See what this man is doing
[1:36:56] is going back a short distance in their
[1:36:58] history and just bringing up our
[1:37:00] theological
[1:37:01] uh uh our colleges were theological
[1:37:04] seminaries. This is a historical fact.
[1:37:07] What has happened to us as a nation? We
[1:37:10] have refused to honor God. And in so
[1:37:13] doing, we open the doors to hatred,
[1:37:15] hatred and violence. And when something
[1:37:17] as terrible as Coline's tragedy occurs,
[1:37:20] politicians immediately look for a
[1:37:22] scapegoat, such as the NRA, they
[1:37:25] immediately seek to pass more
[1:37:27] restrictive laws that contribute to
[1:37:31] erode away our personal and private
[1:37:33] liberties. We do not need more
[1:37:35] restrictive laws. Eric and Dialin would
[1:37:38] not have stopped by uh Eric and Dialin,
[1:37:43] speaking of the two men, would not have
[1:37:44] been stopped by metal detectors. No
[1:37:47] amount of gun laws can stop someone who
[1:37:49] spends months planning this type of
[1:37:52] massacre. The real villain lies within
[1:37:55] our own hearts. As my son Craig lay
[1:37:58] under the table at in the school
[1:38:00] library, he saw two friends murdered
[1:38:03] before his very eyes. He did not
[1:38:05] hesitate to pray in school. I defy any
[1:38:09] law, any politician to deny him that
[1:38:13] right. I challenge every young person in
[1:38:15] America and around the world to realize
[1:38:18] that on April the 20th, 1999 at Columb
[1:38:22] High School, Columbine High School,
[1:38:25] prayer was brought back to our schools.
[1:38:27] Do not let the many prayers offered by
[1:38:30] those students be in vain. dare to move
[1:38:34] into the new millennium with a a sacred
[1:38:37] disregard for legislation that violates
[1:38:40] your God-given right to communicate with
[1:38:42] him. To those of you who would point
[1:38:46] your finger at the NRA, I give you a
[1:38:48] sincere challenge. Dare to examine your
[1:38:51] own heart before casting the first
[1:38:53] stone. Said, "My daughter's death will
[1:38:56] not be in vain. The young people in this
[1:38:58] country will not allow this to happen.
[1:39:02] very somber
[1:39:05] and very penetrating.
[1:39:07] A man I know nothing about his
[1:39:08] background, but he was bold. He was
[1:39:11] courageous to say things in front of
[1:39:14] political leaders of a of America and to
[1:39:18] let them know. He said he he he
[1:39:20] absolutely defies anybody that would try
[1:39:23] to stand up and say now is he was asking
[1:39:28] is that illegal because they prayed in
[1:39:30] school.
[1:39:32] They certainly did pray in school.
[1:39:35] Now why did I do that? I even have
[1:39:37] another one here but I'm not going to
[1:39:39] take the time.
[1:39:41] These people
[1:39:43] as far as I would know know nothing
[1:39:46] about the message and they identify what
[1:39:49] is happening and they identify it to the
[1:39:52] degree that it's very disturbing for
[1:39:54] them. They ident identify their
[1:39:57] environment that's around them and it's
[1:40:00] everywhere around them and it's
[1:40:01] distressing for them. It's disturbing
[1:40:04] for them. We don't want to just go along
[1:40:05] like we're you know we're walking
[1:40:07] through the liies and nothings. We want
[1:40:09] to see that this is a world that God has
[1:40:12] put under judgment.
[1:40:15] &gt;&gt; This is a world that God has declared
[1:40:18] the day of vengeance is not coming. It's
[1:40:21] here.
[1:40:22] &gt;&gt; And I think that we as believers cannot
[1:40:24] really accurately guide or have our
[1:40:27] lives guided unless we're aware that
[1:40:30] this is what is taking place. This is
[1:40:32] what is happening. You young people, you
[1:40:35] young couples with families and you're
[1:40:37] just beginning to raise your family,
[1:40:39] whatever you do, you need to hold this
[1:40:41] uh this scriptural view, this vision
[1:40:44] that God has given. You talk about a
[1:40:47] prophet's vision. This is part of his
[1:40:49] vision.
[1:40:51] &gt;&gt; How much of his message is coming
[1:40:53] against the things that's against God
[1:40:57] and the denominational systems? We don't
[1:40:59] cry out against it like he did.
[1:41:02] And you may be scared to ever have to
[1:41:04] say a word about it because you work
[1:41:06] with nice people,
[1:41:08] &gt;&gt; but God has never changed his mind about
[1:41:11] that system.
[1:41:12] &gt;&gt; He's never changed his mind about that
[1:41:15] system. Do you hear me?
[1:41:17] &gt;&gt; And there are nice people. They really
[1:41:19] need to hear and see the message.
[1:41:22] Whatever whatever you do, if these
[1:41:23] people not ashamed to pray in that
[1:41:26] crisis, let me say to you tonight, we're
[1:41:28] in a much greater crisis than Cola in
[1:41:31] high school.
[1:41:34] &gt;&gt; We're in a much greater crisis than the
[1:41:36] boys that are fighting in Afghanistan or
[1:41:39] over in Iraq. We're in a much greater
[1:41:41] crisis right here in Surrey or
[1:41:44] Washington or wherever you want to say.
[1:41:46] We're in a much greater crisis.
[1:41:50] You're a little quiet tonight, but I'm
[1:41:52] declaring it to you in the name of the
[1:41:53] Lord. What we have out there is a much
[1:41:55] greater crisis. Not that we go out there
[1:41:58] swinging with our fists and so on. It's
[1:42:00] not that kind of a thing, but it is the
[1:42:02] kind of a battle where we are challenged
[1:42:04] to live the kind of life we are supposed
[1:42:07] to live, to live it fervently, to live
[1:42:10] it courageously, to live it without any
[1:42:12] shame.
[1:42:14] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:42:16] and let people know why you are what you
[1:42:18] are, why you live the kind of life that
[1:42:20] you live. We're not here to be silent
[1:42:23] bumps on a log. We're here to live a
[1:42:25] fiery testimony of God.
[1:42:28] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:42:29] &gt;&gt; I said amen because I believe it.
[1:42:32] &gt;&gt; And I've held you longer than I wanted
[1:42:33] to by about 15 minutes.
[1:42:42] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:42:47] I want to sing a song.
[1:42:50] I've been singing it all day. You might
[1:42:51] wonder how in the world do you come up
[1:42:52] with this song after that kind of a
[1:42:55] message? Well, it's easy because after
[1:42:58] looking at the day of vengeance and
[1:43:00] after looking at the dreadful day of the
[1:43:02] Lord, I can only think of one thing.
[1:43:04] When we all get to heaven,
[1:43:08] &gt;&gt; sing the wondrous love of Jesus. Talk
[1:43:11] about of all of his love and care.
[1:43:14] Hallelujah.
[1:43:17] &gt;&gt; Let's stand to your feet.
[1:43:20] [Music]
[1:43:25] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:43:28] &gt;&gt; Sing the wondous love of Jesus. Sing his
[1:43:34] mercy and his praise in
[1:43:40] bright and blessed. He'll prepare for us
[1:43:44] a place
[1:43:46] when we all
[1:43:49] get to heaven.
[1:43:51] [Applause]
[1:43:52] [Music]
[1:43:54] That will be
[1:43:56] when we all
[1:43:58] see Jesus
[1:44:01] will sing. and shout
[1:44:06] while we walk the
[1:44:10] path
[1:44:12] to
[1:44:14] the sky
[1:44:16] [Music]
[1:44:24] when we
[1:44:28] [Music]
[1:44:29] &gt;&gt; What a day of rejoicing. There will be
[1:44:34] &gt;&gt; and when we all
[1:44:36] see Jesus
[1:44:39] we'll sing and shine the victory. The
[1:44:43] fourth verse onward to the price he uses
[1:44:58] [Music]
[1:45:02] when we all
[1:45:04] get to heaven.
[1:45:08] Our rejoicing that will be
[1:45:11] when we all
[1:45:14] see Jesus.
[1:45:16] We'll sing and shout the victory.
[1:45:21] When we all
[1:45:24] heaven
[1:45:27] rejoicing that will be
[1:45:30] when we all
[1:45:33] see
[1:45:37] the victory.
[1:45:40] &gt;&gt; How many realize that we're in a in a
[1:45:43] very very real battle?
[1:45:48] Brother Brandham says of angels
[1:45:51] that in a meeting he said you can
[1:45:54] actually feel their presence
[1:45:58] and they're wanting to influence us.
[1:46:03] I said that to say this.
[1:46:05] When you go walking out where you're
[1:46:08] going to be tomorrow
[1:46:10] and you young people, some of you are
[1:46:12] not in the Byway Christian Academy.
[1:46:14] you're going to be in another school.
[1:46:17] I'm going to tell you something that
[1:46:19] probably is not new to you,
[1:46:23] but I want to I want to sensitize you to
[1:46:26] this that we are in a very very real
[1:46:29] battle.
[1:46:31] And as you're moving about tomorrow or
[1:46:34] this coming week,
[1:46:36] there will most definitely come a moment
[1:46:40] and you'll just feel a weight and a kind
[1:46:42] of a cloud and a heaviness.
[1:46:46] That's a demon spirit
[1:46:49] &gt;&gt; for the most part. That's a demon
[1:46:51] spirit. And he's setting you up.
[1:46:55] He wants to bring a much
[1:46:58] he wants to bring a much more ill effect
[1:47:02] upon you and maybe spread from you to
[1:47:06] someone else in your family between
[1:47:09] husband and wife between parents and
[1:47:11] children and that's an evil spirit.
[1:47:16] &gt;&gt; I've never hardly ever spoken like this
[1:47:17] before. Sometime you start out
[1:47:23] man starts out in the morning
[1:47:25] goes up to fill his car with gas walks
[1:47:29] in to pay the bill and there's all the
[1:47:31] girly magazines right there. Don't look
[1:47:34] surprised. That's exactly what happens.
[1:47:38] And you'll just feel a presence come.
[1:47:40] That's a demon spirit.
[1:47:43] and he wants to set that person up for a
[1:47:48] battle royale.
[1:47:51] &gt;&gt; And you know what I'm talking about is
[1:47:52] absolutely the truth. Some little thing
[1:47:55] just goes sideways in the morning, maybe
[1:47:58] even before breakfast
[1:48:00] and just cast a cloud,
[1:48:03] cast a heaviness.
[1:48:06] That's a demon spirit. And we say, "Oh,
[1:48:09] well, you know, I just uh I'm I'm just
[1:48:13] not having a good day. It's not that
[1:48:15] that's not in the word.
[1:48:18] If what the prophet has said is true and
[1:48:21] you can feel the influence of angels,
[1:48:24] don't forget those guys out there are
[1:48:26] fallen angels
[1:48:28] &gt;&gt; and they know all about worship and
[1:48:30] they're not they're not afraid that
[1:48:32] you've been here in church tonight. But
[1:48:34] they would be afraid if you take a hold
[1:48:36] of the word and become uh have your eyes
[1:48:40] and your focus and your vision
[1:48:43] sensitized. Say, I'm going to stand on
[1:48:45] guard. And the prophet says, "Know what
[1:48:48] kind of licks, what kind of how he
[1:48:51] fights." I'm telling you how he fights.
[1:48:53] That's how he fights.
[1:48:54] &gt;&gt; And if you're just going to lay back and
[1:48:56] let it happen, you'll have a terrible
[1:48:58] struggle in your spiritual life. But I'm
[1:49:00] telling you, it's something that I
[1:49:01] practice.
[1:49:03] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. It's something that I
[1:49:05] practice
[1:49:06] &gt;&gt; and it's something that works.
[1:49:17] Sunday night after the service, I prayed
[1:49:19] for a man for salvation,
[1:49:22] our sister PJ's husband. We prayed
[1:49:26] together for salvation.
[1:49:28] And I gave him exactly the same kind of
[1:49:30] counsel. And I'm leaving you tonight
[1:49:32] with that same kind of counsel. You just
[1:49:36] you you you just watch. We're we're in a
[1:49:39] battle. Put on the whole armor of God.
[1:49:42] You'll be able to withstand all the
[1:49:44] fiery darts. Fiery darts. Yeah, they
[1:49:46] were fired at you today. Maybe you
[1:49:47] didn't even weren't even aware of it.
[1:49:49] He's firing darts at us all the time.
[1:49:51] He's trying to find a loophole
[1:49:54] someplace. But God has given us
[1:49:56] everything that we need to have victory
[1:49:59] over him.
[1:50:01] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:50:03] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:50:04] &gt;&gt; Onward to the prize before us.
[1:50:06] &gt;&gt; God bless you for being here. Thank you
[1:50:08] for your support. Thank you for filling
[1:50:10] this church up tonight and I appreciate
[1:50:12] your prayers. Let's remember the weekend
[1:50:14] our brother Caillumbi, our brother
[1:50:16] Toby's father is going to be preaching
[1:50:17] on Sunday. He'll be preaching in French,
[1:50:19] but brother Dier will be uh translating,
[1:50:23] interpreting for him. And I tell you, I
[1:50:25] was so moved at at the message that he

[1:50:33] very uh qualified and uh uh very mature
[1:50:37] ministry of our brother Caillumbi.

[1:51:34] what a day of rejoicing that will be.
[1:51:38] And when we All
[1:51:42] Jesus
[1:51:44] will sing and shout the victory.
[1:51:48] &gt;&gt; I'm going to ask brother Arnold Dross.

[1:52:12] Certainly been a pleasure to be here

[1:52:16] people. It's always uh an attributes of
[1:52:20] uh beneficial help to each and every one
[1:52:22] of us. And so good to have these words
[1:52:24] of enlightenment
[1:52:26] to better help us to understand the
[1:52:29] darkness of the world that we as the
[1:52:31] lights of God are passing through. So
[1:52:34] we'd appreciate your continued prayers
[1:52:36] for the occasion and to ourselves and
[1:52:39] our ministry there and the children of
[1:52:41] God there in Ontario. So let us bow
[1:52:44] tonight in prayer.
[1:52:47] Loving Father, we certainly appreciate
[1:52:51] the greatness of our Lord and our Savior
[1:52:53] and the benevolence of your great truth
[1:52:55] you've sent in this hour and the men of
[1:52:58] God that you have treasured with the
[1:53:00] opportunity to carry this light and to
[1:53:02] share it and to bring it forth to be a

[1:53:08] one of your children. And we want to

[1:53:15] congregation, the ministry, Brother Ed,
[1:53:17] and the ones that are ministering with
[1:53:19] them here in this tabernacle, Lord, this
[1:53:22] oasis here in this western part of this
[1:53:26] country, Canada. And we would just pray
[1:53:29] now that you would continue to lead and
[1:53:31] to guide us toward that perfect day, oh
[1:53:34] God.
[1:53:35] If we should never see one another again

[1:53:47] the hand of your father, he has given to
[1:53:50] you and none shall be lost. We look
[1:53:52] forward to that day. In the meantime,
[1:53:55] Lord, as our brother has ministered
[1:53:57] tonight, let us go forth and be an
[1:54:00] impact by being the light in this world.
[1:54:04] In Jesus name we ask. Amen.
