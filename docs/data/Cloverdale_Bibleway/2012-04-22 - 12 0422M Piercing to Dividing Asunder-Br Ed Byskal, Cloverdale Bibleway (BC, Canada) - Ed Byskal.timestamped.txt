[23:58] He's faithful and he's true. All of
[24:01] those songs meant something, each one of
[24:03] them, to me this morning. And I thought,
[24:05] you know, what else can we say? He's
[24:07] faithful.
[24:08] &gt;&gt; He's true.
[24:14] Bless you, saints. I've just been uh
[24:17] pondering and rejoicing within my own
[24:20] heart of what it means to be right with
[24:21] God. And this song just began to go
[24:23] through my mind. And so I trust that you
[24:26] would rejoice. is called, "Oh, to be
[24:28] right with God." And it's not
[24:30] necessarily that we're not and that
[24:32] we're longing. It's just exclaiming,
[24:33] "Oh, to be right with God and what it
[24:35] means to be under the blood and to have
[24:37] fellowship with him and to not come to
[24:39] him always in repentance, trying to make
[24:42] something right, but actually moving on
[24:43] in fellowship and communion with God."
[24:45] And I find sometimes the enemy doesn't
[24:48] even have to get something between us
[24:49] and God. He just has to convince us that
[24:51] there is something. And I just say, "Put
[24:54] it under the blood. And if it's under
[24:55] the blood, move on and rejoice in what
[24:57] it means to be right with God. And so I
[24:59] hope it's a blessing to you.

[28:45] is sweeter,
[28:48] no treasure more [music and singing]
[28:50] dear
[28:52] than dwelling

[28:56] with his presence
[29:00] near.
[29:02] [singing] Oh, [music]
[29:04] to be right
[29:07] with God.
[29:09] [singing]
[29:12] Oh, to be right
[29:16] with [music] God.
[29:21] Oh, to [music] be right
[29:25] with God.
[29:29] Oh, blood [music]
[29:31] washed

[29:37] between.

[29:41] to be right
[29:44] with [music] God.
[29:48] Blood washed [music and singing]
[29:50] and clean
[29:53] with nothing
[29:55] between [music]
[29:58] all to be right

[30:06] [singing]
[30:08] Oh, [music] to be right
[30:13] with God.
[30:18] [music]
[30:24] [music]
[30:29] [applause]
[30:34] as the deer penth for the water. As we
[30:37] invite our pastor to come [music] this
[30:38] morning
[30:40] as the Sunday school children make their
[30:42] way in and find their [music] seats,
[30:45] find their families, their parents,
[30:48] the [music] new generation walking down
[30:50] the aisles.
[30:52] They raise right up amongst us.
[30:55] [music] Amen.
[30:59] As the [singing]
[31:01] deer [music]
[31:02] panteth for
[31:05] the water, so [singing] my soul longeth
[31:09] [music] after
[31:11] [singing] thee.
[31:15] You [music and singing]
[31:16] alone
[31:18] are my heart's
[31:20] desire and I long [music]
[31:24] to worship
[31:26] thee.
[31:29] &gt;&gt; [music]
[31:30] &gt;&gt; You [singing] alone
[31:33] are [music] my strength, my shield. To
[31:38] you [music and singing]
[31:39] alone
[31:41] does my spirit [music] yield.
[31:46] [singing]
[31:48] You alone [music]
[31:51] are my heart's
[31:53] desire and I long
[31:57] to worship
[31:59] thee. [music]
[32:02] For you're my [music] friend and you
[32:07] [singing] are
[32:08] my brother even though [music]
[32:12] you are [singing] a king.
[32:17] Yes, I
[32:19] want [music and singing] you more than
[32:22] any
[32:24] other. So much more
[32:27] than [music and singing] anything.
[32:32] [music] For you
[32:34] alone [singing]
[32:36] are my strength, my shield. [music]
[32:40] To you alone [singing]
[32:43] does my spirit
[32:46] yield. [music and singing]
[32:50] You alone
[32:53] are my heart
[32:55] desire [music and singing]
[32:56] and I long to worship
[33:01] thee. [music]
[33:03] I want you. I [singing] want you more
[33:08] than gold
[33:10] or silver only you
[33:14] can satisfy. [music and singing]
[33:19] [music] You alone [singing]
[33:22] are the real joy [music]
[33:25] giver and the [singing] apple
[33:29] of my eyes [music]
[33:33] for [singing]
[33:34] you. You alone are my strength. [music]
[33:39] You're my shield. To you [singing] alone
[33:44] does my
[33:47] [music]
[33:51] You alone [singing]
[33:53] [music]
[33:54] are my heart
[33:57] and [music] my
[34:00] to worship
[34:02] me.
[34:05] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[34:07] &gt;&gt; Isn't it wonderful?
[34:09] &gt;&gt; Do you enjoy your salvation?
[34:12] &gt;&gt; Amen. We don't want to be out there in
[34:15] the world. The world hasn't got much to
[34:17] offer, do they?
[34:18] &gt;&gt; Don't have anything to offer.
[34:21] &gt;&gt; That's the longer you live, the more you
[34:23] realize that the longer the world goes
[34:27] on, the less it has.
[34:30] &gt;&gt; And the longer the world goes on, the
[34:32] longer we go on, the more we have.
[34:35] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[34:37] &gt;&gt; I want to thank all of those that have
[34:40] been coming out faithfully this last
[34:42] week and and uh concluding the work at
[34:45] the at the school building. Uh we call
[34:48] it the school building. We actually want
[34:49] to use the the gym I call it gym
[34:51] auditorium. We're hoping to be able to
[34:54] use it at the uh and we will by God's
[34:56] grace uh at the anniversary meetings.
[35:00] So, we're looking forward to that and
[35:02] we're very very near winding it up. We I
[35:06] want to thank you. It was an excellent
[35:07] show show up this uh showing rather this
[35:10] week of the workers and just any time
[35:13] that you can in this coming week or two
[35:15] and we'll be all finished. Uh
[35:19] I want to just say in reference to the
[35:22] uh service this morning before we before
[35:25] we stand and read the scripture
[35:27] I have been uh coincidentally
[35:31] Wednesday's service we didn't archive
[35:33] it. If you weren't here Wednesday's
[35:35] service and you wish to get it you'll
[35:37] have to see uh brother Aaron or sister
[35:40] Debbie in the office because we didn't
[35:42] archive it. But I felt it was very very
[35:45] [clears throat] personal just to our
[35:46] congregation and uh but we have already
[35:51] uh provided it to some who wanted to
[35:53] hear it and uh so it was it's kind of a
[35:58] downhome you know a lot of personal
[36:00] things and just testimony and uh but I
[36:04] wanted to be kind of an introduction for
[36:07] today's service as well. [clears throat]
[36:10] Well, they just brought brother Edwin
[36:12] Dods in. Hallelujah. Brother Edwin Dods.
[36:17] [applause]
[36:21] [applause]
[36:26] I don't know. I thought he was in a
[36:27] holding pattern, but Brother Edwin's
[36:29] just having another birthday.
[36:32] Hallelujah. God bless you, brother
[36:34] Edwin.
[36:35] &gt;&gt; One stalwart soldier.
[36:38] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Glory to God.
[36:41] Hallelujah. Prayed for you this morning,
[36:44] too, while we were praying for the
[36:45] different saints. And some of you are
[36:47] sitting here. You don't maybe not aware
[36:50] of it, but you come on my mind while
[36:54] we're praying. So, we just start praying
[36:56] for you. I don't know why God puts you
[36:59] on my mind or on our heart and God put
[37:04] me on your heart and you mentioned my
[37:06] name. God bless you. Amen.
[37:09] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. I appreciate that. And if he
[37:11] hasn't, maybe he will later on today.
[37:15] Amen. We can't get enough or too much.
[37:19] But what I've been uh uh approaching in
[37:23] the scripture and I've been listening to
[37:25] the messages and been speaking to my own
[37:28] wife
[37:30] because uh
[37:33] I just feel as though that there is more
[37:37] in the word of God
[37:40] than than perhaps we are obtaining. So I
[37:44] want to find that key
[37:48] uh just to obtain what we have need of.
[37:52] We one thing is certain we have needs
[37:56] and a second thing that's certain we
[37:58] have the Jehovah Gyra
[38:00] &gt;&gt; who provides all those needs and so all
[38:03] we have to do is just find that place to
[38:06] connect them. You might say well is that
[38:08] such a difficulty? Well, yeah, it's a
[38:10] difficulty because we have uh we have un
[38:14] unanswered prayers. Uh not that God is
[38:17] we can't dictate to him. It might not be
[38:19] today, might be tomorrow, might be next
[38:21] week, but we want to have a perfect
[38:24] faith.
[38:25] &gt;&gt; Amen. Because there's a rest in the
[38:27] perfect faith. We don't need a big
[38:30] support group from the world. We don't
[38:32] need all kinds of psychology. We don't
[38:35] need all kinds of additives. Uh we don't
[38:38] need anything. I believe we just need
[38:40] God's word. And if we can lay hold of
[38:43] that, you believe we have it.
[38:45] &gt;&gt; I believe we do. I really do. And I see
[38:48] others in the scripture
[38:51] uh not only in the scripture but I've
[38:54] experienced also in my own life where
[38:59] it just seems that you find a place in
[39:03] and uh if God is pleased with something
[39:07] or someone
[39:10] and I always try to find discover what
[39:14] is it. Um, for those of you that had an
[39:17] opportunity to see the meetings from
[39:20] Switzerland and I had the Larga family
[39:23] up, and I mentioned this probably uh in
[39:26] a last meeting or two, but now Sunday
[39:28] morning, I'd like to mention it again.
[39:31] And uh, Brother Larga passed away when
[39:34] he was 46. I believe there's eight
[39:35] children. And the youngest one was just
[39:39] a months old. It was about a year old. a
[39:43] baby in arms and then they went from
[39:46] there on up into their teens and she was
[39:49] a very very young widow. She ended up in
[39:52] her uh either late 30s or early 40s with
[39:57] all that family.
[39:59] Uh he was a teacher so they have no
[40:02] social network in that country in
[40:04] Croatia at that time and uh she's left
[40:08] alone with his children. I know brother
[40:11] Milco and we and I we spoke a good deal
[40:14] from time to time and I know that he did
[40:18] everything he could to assist them. We
[40:21] did everything we could to be a
[40:22] spiritual support to them. We also sent
[40:25] some offering to help her, but I knew it
[40:27] wasn't near enough. And I just wondered
[40:30] how in the world is this woman ever
[40:32] going to, you know, survive with this
[40:34] family? And as soon as these children
[40:37] are old enough, they're probably going
[40:38] to, you know, just disappear and go
[40:41] their own way. And
[40:43] to see them all these years later,
[40:48] the young men, all of them about 6'3 a
[40:50] piece, big broad shouldered guys.
[40:55] Jonathan, when his father went to the
[40:58] grave, it's just like Jonathan stepped
[41:00] right into his mold.
[41:03] Looks like him. His father was
[41:06] translator. Jonathan just continued
[41:08] translating. His father distributed the
[41:11] message books and got them out every way
[41:13] possible. I mean, he could invent ways
[41:16] to get them out. And Jonathan just
[41:18] started doing the same thing. It was
[41:20] like one left and the other one just
[41:22] came in with was much younger and and
[41:25] full of ideas and full and never
[41:28] stopped. Never stopped. just just one
[41:32] focus in mind as a kingdom of God get
[41:35] this message. This message is God's word
[41:38] to this generation. And then and then up
[41:41] come his brothers and they just come in
[41:42] right behind him and started looking
[41:44] like a team. And here's the sisters and
[41:47] his sisters and they all stand there. I
[41:50] had them come up on the platform. You
[41:52] want to see them? But now I want to tell
[41:55] you why I had them come up on the
[41:57] platform. And the people there didn't
[41:59] know and most of them still don't know
[42:01] except perhaps some from Switzerland may
[42:03] be streaming this service. It's
[42:05] nighttime there and this is their
[42:06] evening service.
[42:09] But I wanted [clears throat] it. It was
[42:12] partly for myself and partly for this
[42:14] congregation. I want you to be able to
[42:16] have a a just look at this family.
[42:20] When I look at a family like that
[42:23] and I know that humanly
[42:26] it isn't it isn't any human intelligence
[42:30] that that mother was able
[42:33] to
[42:35] raise that family.
[42:37] She's more like one of them rather than,
[42:40] you know, she's not one that would be
[42:44] rigid, I suppose, or overbearing or
[42:48] overpowering or anything of that nature.
[42:51] And when I see that, now I'm just
[42:53] telling you something very personal.
[42:54] When I see something like that, I I I
[42:58] want to look at it. I want to observe
[43:01] it. And in deep in my heart of hearts, I
[43:04] say
[43:07] either this woman or the father who
[43:10] passed away
[43:12] has did something
[43:15] that God smiled on and just simply said,
[43:19] "I'm going to bless this family. I'm
[43:22] just going to bless them." That's it.
[43:24] Finished. When God said, you might
[43:26] question that, but when God said to
[43:27] Abraham, I'm going to bless you and I'm
[43:30] going to bless those that bless you. And
[43:32] there's no changing that, that's an
[43:35] irrevocable statement. And you know then
[43:38] then I try to observe because I want to
[43:41] pick up even if it's by the process of
[43:45] osmosis I want to pick up what
[43:49] characteristic what is it that God was
[43:53] so pleased with and you can't you you
[43:56] can't tell me nobody here or nobody in
[43:59] the world could ever convince me that
[44:02] somehow there was something that God
[44:05] observed something that God loved. And
[44:09] just to see that entire family standing
[44:11] there, about 10 11 of them now. And uh
[44:16] I just uh uh it was a blessing to me. A
[44:20] real blessing to me.
[44:23] What is there in
[44:26] an an individual? And I I'm speaking to
[44:28] everybody. It's not beyond you. You want
[44:31] to ask the same question. What is it,
[44:33] Father, that you'd have me to do? What
[44:37] can I do?
[44:39] How how do you want me to respond? How
[44:41] do you want me to react? And so I'm
[44:44] going to be going into
[44:47] uh approach,
[44:49] going to be going into attitude,
[44:52] we're going to go into things that I
[44:54] think influence
[44:57] and uh uh because there are simp simple
[45:00] things and they're within everybody's
[45:02] reach and they're things which people
[45:05] received. They received physical things
[45:09] from God. And quite frankly, I want to
[45:11] announce to you, I'm interested in that.
[45:14] &gt;&gt; I'm interested in a supernatural God
[45:18] coming down amongst us and doing
[45:20] supernatural things.
[45:22] &gt;&gt; And no one can convince me we don't need
[45:24] that. And as time goes on, we need that
[45:26] more and more and more all the time.
[45:29] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[45:32] &gt;&gt; So, let's stand as we read, please.
[45:44] We'll not be using any slides today, so
[45:48] you won't have to worry about that. I'm
[45:49] going to read out of Hebrews the 4th
[45:51] chapter once again, which we did last
[45:54] week as well. And uh [clears throat]
[45:57] I'll start at the 12th verse to just
[45:59] shorten our time a wee bit.
[46:02] And before we read, let us pray
[46:04] together. I'd like you to pray. You just
[46:08] ask God, "Father, make your word to be
[46:12] special to me today. Heavenly Father,
[46:16] uh I bow with this group of people, this
[46:18] audience of people that are here
[46:21] gathered and were so desirous. I enjoyed
[46:25] hearing the prayer that Brother Dave
[46:27] Ternoff prayed. Lord, how he expressed a
[46:31] love for the people. And I I recall just
[46:34] reading this week, Lord, how your
[46:37] prophet stood up and brother Jo uh
[46:40] Joseph Matson Boz had just spoke to his
[46:44] people and expressed his love to the
[46:46] people because of what they meant to
[46:49] him, Father. And I pray, Lord, you'll
[46:51] cause it to be and let it be a reality
[46:54] to these people. how I have such a
[46:57] personal love for them and for the many
[47:00] that are not present in this building,
[47:03] but they're elsewhere and they're in far
[47:05] away lands. And how we love the bride of
[47:08] Jesus Christ. Oh, how wonderful, Father,
[47:12] is your great redemption. And we're here
[47:15] this morning to rejoice in it. We're
[47:18] here this morning, Lord, to give you
[47:20] glory. Thank you for salvation. Thank
[47:24] you for deliverance from the enemy's
[47:26] camp. Thank you for paying off, oh God,
[47:29] the debt of our lives. And now we have
[47:31] and the gift of eternal life. Now I pray
[47:34] you'll anoint both speaker and hearers
[47:37] as we read your word and give us insight
[47:40] in Jesus Christ's name. We give
[47:43] ourselves to you unreservedly now. Amen.
[47:47] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[47:49] the fourth chapter, Hebrews and the 12th
[47:52] verse.
[47:55] For the word of God is quick and
[47:57] powerful and sharper than any two-edged
[48:00] sword, piercing even to the dividing of
[48:04] sunder of soul and spirit, like you to
[48:07] notice between soul and spirit, and of
[48:11] the joints and marrow, and is a
[48:14] discerner of the thoughts and intents of
[48:16] the heart. Neither is there any creature
[48:20] that is not manifest in his sight, but
[48:23] all things are naked and open unto the
[48:26] eyes of him with whom we have to do.
[48:31] And the 14th verse, seeing then that we
[48:34] have a great high priest that is passed
[48:37] into the heavens, Jesus the son of God,
[48:40] let us hold fast our profession. And I'd
[48:45] like you to turn to Genesis if you would
[48:47] please. Uh I'm going to read one verse
[48:50] out of chapter 2 which is verse 16.
[48:56] The reason I'm going back to the Genesis
[48:59] account. It's I I need to explain this
[49:02] to you is because we have read where the
[49:05] word of God is quick and powerful and
[49:07] sharper than any two-edged sword. We
[49:10] read of the of the position and the
[49:12] place of the word and what's been
[49:15] restored in our time. But now I want to
[49:18] see when that word became
[49:25] twisted,
[49:27] misrepresented.
[49:30] uh and when unbelief was introduced,
[49:34] it was introduced just with one word
[49:36] which we know well
[49:40] in the second chapter verse 16 says and
[49:42] the Lord God commanded the man saying of
[49:46] every tree of the garden thou mayest
[49:49] freely eat. Start with Genesis the 3rd
[49:52] chapter verse 1.
[49:54] Now the serpent was more subtle than any
[49:57] beast of the field which the Lord God
[49:59] had made. And he said unto the woman,
[50:01] "Yeah, hath God said that you shall not
[50:04] eat of the tree of the garden?" And the
[50:07] woman said unto the serpent, "We may eat
[50:10] of the fruit of the trees of the garden.
[50:12] But of the fruit of the tree which is in
[50:14] the midst of the garden, God hath said,
[50:16] Ye shall not eat of it, neither shall
[50:19] you touch it, lest you die." And the
[50:23] serpent said unto the woman, "You shall
[50:25] not surely die. For God knoweth that in
[50:29] the day that you eat thereof, then your
[50:32] eyes shall be opened, and you shall be
[50:35] as gods, knowing good and evil." And
[50:38] when the woman saw that the tree was
[50:40] good for food, and that it was pleasant
[50:42] to the eyes, and a tree to be desired to
[50:46] make one wise, she took of the fruit
[50:48] thereof, and did eat, and gave also unto
[50:52] her husband with her, and he did eat.
[50:56] Amen. You may be seated.
[51:01] You may want to keep your Bibles open.
[51:06] And if you
[51:09] begin to feel the word of God speak to
[51:11] you, you can respond and that will be a
[51:14] blessing to me also.
[51:17] Excuse [clears throat] me.
[51:23] I will just uh uh I just want to start
[51:27] with this Genesis chapter for just a
[51:30] moment just for a few moments by way of
[51:32] introduction.
[51:35] Uh, I'd like you to notice in Genesis 3
[51:37] and1
[51:41] and the serpent uh, uh, there's three
[51:43] things I want you to see.
[51:46] The serpent said,
[51:48] the woman said, and God said,
[51:54] and to say something, there has to be an
[51:56] intent behind it.
[51:59] There has to be a thought. And a thought
[52:02] you know has to have an intent behind
[52:04] it. And the even the word that is used
[52:07] when the scripture I gave you now two or
[52:10] three times and God said let there be
[52:13] light
[52:15] doesn't even mean and and I asked the
[52:17] question many times and posed the
[52:19] question and I don't think we have the
[52:21] answer but it posed the question what
[52:24] sound was that? What language was that?
[52:27] What or was it a sound? uh it's written
[52:30] in words but perhaps the words that we
[52:33] have written in the Bible. The Bible
[52:35] says and and and God uh uh and and and
[52:40] God uh the Lord spake to Jeremiah. the
[52:43] Lord spake to but it doesn't say how he
[52:46] spake and whether it's in the language
[52:49] his mother tongue or is it something
[52:51] that's within is it is it something that
[52:54] is moved uh within we we don't know
[52:57] exactly God spoke in a dream God spoke
[53:00] by vision God spoke in a whirlwind
[53:04] uh all of these things we have the word
[53:06] of God in written form but multitudes
[53:10] and hundreds of millions of people have
[53:14] this written scripture and do not hear
[53:16] the word of God.
[53:19] &gt;&gt; And so it's more than just words on
[53:21] pages. Even though the prophet said this
[53:24] is God in written form, but they do not
[53:28] they're not able to capture
[53:30] &gt;&gt; the essence. They are not able to
[53:33] capture what is there for them. The
[53:36] promises can be there. And so this is
[53:38] what I'll be focusing on throughout the
[53:41] uh throughout the uh service. And and
[53:44] then when this and when the serpent
[53:46] first approached Eve and he said hath
[53:50] God said this verse one
[53:54] hath God said you shall not eat of every
[53:58] tree of the garden. Now I I'm not just
[54:00] giving a historical account. This is up
[54:03] todate. This fits every person here
[54:05] because there's a lesson here. A
[54:08] incredible valuable lesson. Satan
[54:11] misqued
[54:13] the statement in fact is God said you
[54:17] may freely eat of the you may freely
[54:20] this is all yours and then Satan now he
[54:24] comes and suggests uh hath God said and
[54:28] that's a question that you shall not eat
[54:31] of every tree of the garden and then the
[54:34] woman made her first error in entering
[54:37] into a dialogue into a discussion with
[54:41] Satan. And there isn't a person here
[54:44] that Satan hasn't spoken to.
[54:47] &gt;&gt; And probably there isn't a person here
[54:49] that hasn't made this same mistake. We
[54:52] start dissecting what he said and we
[54:55] start even responding to what he said
[54:58] and we start you know uh uh in our mind
[55:01] we begin to react and we begin to
[55:03] respond and and Satan has no doubt TOLD
[55:06] YOU ALL KINDS of things and then you
[55:09] begin to think about it and weigh it
[55:10] out. That's the wrong thing.
[55:13] &gt;&gt; We're not to do that. And so she
[55:15] responded and and now speaks no this is
[55:19] what the word said. This is what God
[55:22] said. And he said that we may eat of the
[55:24] trees of the garden, but of the tree of
[55:27] the uh of the tree of which is in the
[55:29] midst of the garden that God said, "You
[55:31] shall not eat of it, neither shall you
[55:34] touch it, lest you die." And then the
[55:36] serpent comes in with uh with his u
[55:39] shot. Uh the serpent said to the woman,
[55:43] "You shall not
[55:45] surely die." He must like the word not
[55:48] because he used it in his first mis
[55:50] misquote and used it again when he came
[55:52] with his final statement. He said you
[55:55] shall not. Did God say that you shall
[55:57] not eat of the trees of the garden? Said
[55:59] no that's not what he said. He said we
[56:02] may eat of the tree of the garden but of
[56:04] this certain tree we must not partake of
[56:07] that. We must not partake of this lest
[56:10] we die. He said you shall not surely
[56:13] die. So now he's and and this is
[56:16] something that's for every person that's
[56:18] in here. Do not enter into a dialogue
[56:21] with this slicker.
[56:24] &gt;&gt; Do not enter into a reasoning with him.
[56:28] &gt;&gt; He knows this Bible better than you do.
[56:32] &gt;&gt; He knows this Bible better than you do.
[56:35] Probably better than you will ever know
[56:36] it. But he hasn't got the revelation
[56:39] that God gives to his children. He
[56:42] doesn't have any revelation. And so
[56:44] don't go to his level and begin to
[56:46] discuss or begin to dialogue with even
[56:49] the thoughts that he chose IN YOUR MIND.
[56:52] DON'T RESPOND to them.
[56:56] And then I would like you to notice this
[56:58] that the
[57:02] he what he appealed to
[57:05] he said and I'm just I wanting to take
[57:08] it a little easier just at the beginning
[57:12] and uh so he appealed to her reasoning
[57:19] which is in the spirit realm.
[57:21] He appealed to her sight.
[57:25] He appealed to her imagination,
[57:28] which is in the spirit realm. You'll be
[57:31] like gods.
[57:33] Uh he appealed to her hearing because
[57:37] she heard what he was saying or how she
[57:40] was saying it. He was saying it. So he
[57:43] appear he appears to these various parts
[57:47] of uh uh of the
[57:51] of the physical gates, the physical
[57:55] senses.
[57:56] &gt;&gt; Please see this. And the spirit senses
[58:00] of the spirit, the senses of the
[58:02] emotional realm, whether it be affection
[58:04] or imagination. He he appealed to her
[58:07] memory. hath God said appealed to her
[58:11] memory appealed to her see and she saw
[58:14] the tree and and she said it's good for
[58:17] food and this is this is delightful so
[58:20] he appealed to the senses
[58:23] &gt;&gt; that's what he did
[58:25] &gt;&gt; and that is why I read as a text for the
[58:29] word of God is quick and powerful
[58:32] &gt;&gt; and sharper than any two-edged sword
[58:35] &gt;&gt; piercing even to even to the dividing
[58:39] aunderder
[58:41] of soul and spirit.
[58:44] &gt;&gt; God has reserved that one channel to
[58:47] your soul for faith and Satan want to
[58:51] poke down unbelief.
[58:54] &gt;&gt; You shall not surely but he has to
[58:55] appeal to the reasoning before he can
[58:58] get that uh down to her. So I want to
[59:02] begin then with uh piercing even to the
[59:06] dividing of sunder which is the title of
[59:08] the service this morning. Piercing to
[59:11] the dividing aunderder and the word
[59:14] piercing is and this is this is
[59:18] important that you get this piercing is
[59:22] to go through to penetrate or to pierce.
[59:26] That's the beginning. But it comes from
[59:29] another word that is and this is where
[59:32] you have to take a another turn. It's to
[59:35] arrive. When something pierces, it
[59:38] arrives.
[59:39] Say this sword pierced through uh a
[59:43] board. It it arrived. It's on the other
[59:46] side. So it is also to arrive to be
[59:50] sufficient
[59:53] uh to be enough sufficient in ability
[59:56] and it comes from a a base word in the
[1:00:01] Greek which is to come to have come to
[1:00:07] have arrived
[1:00:09] to be present and metaphorically to come
[1:00:12] to one to seek an intimacy with one to
[1:00:16] become his follower to come upon one uh
[1:00:21] to come upon one of of uh uh that you're
[1:00:25] desiring to be with. So to come and so
[1:00:30] the word of God, the word of God, now I
[1:00:33] want you to think in terms of Christ is
[1:00:35] quick and powerful and sharper than any
[1:00:40] two-edged sword. For the word is a
[1:00:42] two-edged sword, piercing even through
[1:00:45] the dividing of sunder of soul and
[1:00:48] spirit. And in this age, if you want to
[1:00:52] just take the world at large, if you
[1:00:55] want to take the whole realm of
[1:00:57] entertainment, you want to take the
[1:00:59] whole realm of Hollywood or the world
[1:01:03] and any of you young people that are
[1:01:04] struggling with the world, I'll tell you
[1:01:06] how you're struggling. You're struggling
[1:01:08] with the senses. You're struggling with
[1:01:11] what you hear.
[1:01:12] &gt;&gt; You're struggling with what you see.
[1:01:15] Hey, you know, I I go by in the airports
[1:01:18] every once in a while and always the the
[1:01:20] duty free is there. How many have ever
[1:01:22] seen the dutyfree? You don't even have
[1:01:24] to say it. You can smell it.
[1:01:27] &gt;&gt; I tell my wife I don't need to put any
[1:01:29] aftershave on. I just have to walk past
[1:01:31] the dutyfree and I got enough to last me
[1:01:34] a day or two. But all all those
[1:01:37] fragrances, did you ever ever hear them
[1:01:40] advertised? They're so enticing. They
[1:01:43] all have an appeal, a sex appeal.
[1:01:47] &gt;&gt; To be honest with you, you folks,
[1:01:49] whether you say amen or not, I'm going
[1:01:50] to preach it.
[1:01:52] &gt;&gt; The whole world is given over to the
[1:01:54] senses.
[1:01:56] &gt;&gt; Hollywood is totally on the emotional
[1:01:58] realm. It's all senses. And the thing
[1:02:01] and and then the the
[1:02:05] church world adopted that. So they got
[1:02:08] people to move into maybe telling a sad
[1:02:11] story and then their hearts are moved
[1:02:13] and people begin and then brother
[1:02:16] Brandham even talks about it and people
[1:02:18] come and pray and and then they're
[1:02:19] saying to him, "Well, you you've been a
[1:02:22] you've been a rascal, but your mom
[1:02:24] prayed for you and don't you want to see
[1:02:26] her on the other side?" That's all
[1:02:29] appealing to the affections and the
[1:02:32] emotions at that level and that and then
[1:02:36] a person walks out and the devil says,
[1:02:38] "You didn't get anything." And he has to
[1:02:39] agree, "Yeah, I really didn't get
[1:02:41] anything. I had a I had a sob. I I cried
[1:02:44] a little bit. I thought about my mom. I
[1:02:46] thought about heaven. I thought about
[1:02:48] when she died. I thought about her
[1:02:50] praying. I thought about the good life
[1:02:52] she lived. I thought about what a what a
[1:02:54] scoundrel I am." and and that that goes
[1:02:57] nowhere,
[1:02:58] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:02:59] &gt;&gt; Because that's not a word-based
[1:03:01] &gt;&gt; experience.
[1:03:03] &gt;&gt; It's far better if you sit in your seat
[1:03:05] and hear the word preached
[1:03:07] &gt;&gt; and saying that's the truth.
[1:03:10] &gt;&gt; That is TAKING THE HIDE OFF MY BACK, BUT
[1:03:12] THAT'S THE TRUTH.
[1:03:14] &gt;&gt; GOD'S WORD IS true
[1:03:15] &gt;&gt; and I AM GOING TO ACCEPT THAT
[1:03:18] &gt;&gt; and I'm going to deny the enemy.
[1:03:20] &gt;&gt; I DENY SATAN AND I ACCEPT THIS. I YIELD
[1:03:25] MYSELF to it and something will happen
[1:03:27] for you
[1:03:28] &gt;&gt; because that'll come by faith
[1:03:31] &gt;&gt; so he appealed to those things. But then
[1:03:34] the word of God says that it pierces
[1:03:37] even to the dividing of sunder. It
[1:03:40] pierces through. And I want to just
[1:03:42] bring it down very very quickly because
[1:03:44] I I've got a ways to go and I'm limited
[1:03:47] on my time. But Jesus Christ, the word
[1:03:50] in flesh, in this day, I'm just going to
[1:03:54] come right to the heart of it, pierced
[1:03:56] through. He arrived, he was sufficient
[1:04:00] to pierce through the veil of sinful
[1:04:04] human flesh and brought salvation.
[1:04:07] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:04:08] &gt;&gt; When he was born and the word was, the
[1:04:10] Bible says, "And the word was made flesh
[1:04:13] and dwelt among us." And the Bible says,
[1:04:16] "In the land of Zabilon and the land of
[1:04:19] Nephilim, by the way of the sea beyond
[1:04:22] Jordan, Galilee of the Gentiles, the
[1:04:25] people which sat in darkness
[1:04:28] saw a great light."
[1:04:31] &gt;&gt; How come? Because a light penetrated
[1:04:34] that darkness.
[1:04:36] &gt;&gt; GOD WAS MADE FLESH AND GOD PIERCED
[1:04:39] THROUGH. OH MY. HE PIERCED THROUGH THE
[1:04:43] FALLEN condition of man. He came down to
[1:04:46] where man was and it they saw a great
[1:04:49] light and to them which sat in in the
[1:04:51] region of the shadow of death light is
[1:04:54] sprung up. Brother Brandham used another
[1:04:56] language another expression. He said he
[1:04:59] spoke of Christ a super sign and how
[1:05:02] that he stretched his tent down here to
[1:05:06] dwell and be a human being. HE STRETCHED
[1:05:09] HIS TENT. HE PIERCED THROUGH mortal and
[1:05:13] immortality.
[1:05:14] HE CAME DOWN. IT'S FALLEN AND AS DARK AS
[1:05:17] WE ARE. HE PIERCED THROUGH THE DARKNESS
[1:05:20] of Leodysia.
[1:05:22] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. HE PIERCED THROUGH all the
[1:05:25] denominational barriers. AND PIERCING
[1:05:28] THROUGH FURTHERMORE, IT HAD A THE ROOT
[1:05:31] WORD. HE ARRIVED.
[1:05:33] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. The word arrived. HE SAID
[1:05:36] LUKE 17:30, "AND IN the day when THE SON
[1:05:40] OF MAN WILL BE REVEALED, IT'LL BE A DAY
[1:05:42] LIKE SODOM." WE GOT IT.
[1:05:45] &gt;&gt; WE GOT IT EVERYWHERE. IT'LL BE A DAY
[1:05:47] LIKE NOAH'S TIME. THEY PLANTED AND THEY
[1:05:50] SOLD AND THEY BUILT AND THEY DID ALL OF
[1:05:52] THESE THINGS. THE WHOLE WORLD IS covered
[1:05:55] with those two uh two descriptions. And
[1:05:58] Jesus said himself, "That'll be the
[1:06:00] day." Folks, we've arrived. Amen.
[1:06:04] &gt;&gt; I announce to you, he's arrived.
[1:06:07] &gt;&gt; He penetrated THROUGH THE FORCES. AND
[1:06:10] THE SCRIPTURE says of this, and you'll
[1:06:12] have to help me here now. The scripture
[1:06:15] says, and you're living in it, THE MOST
[1:06:18] DECEPTIVE AGE of all time.
[1:06:24] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:06:25] &gt;&gt; YOU WONDER SAY, "WELL, YOU KNOW, I HAVE
[1:06:27] A BATTLE." Of course you have a battle.
[1:06:30] I HAVE A STRUGGLE. OF COURSE YOU HAVE A
[1:06:32] STRUGGLE. Deception you can't just
[1:06:35] identify. It's not just a, you know,
[1:06:38] it's not just something that you can
[1:06:39] isolate and say, "Well, HERE THIS IS
[1:06:41] DECEPTION." IT'S EVERYWHERE.
[1:06:43] &gt;&gt; IT COVERS THE EARTH LIKE a like a wave.
[1:06:47] &gt;&gt; Deception. And furthermore, you want to
[1:06:51] take note of what I have to say today.
[1:06:53] The scripture says the deception will BE
[1:06:56] SO GREAT THAT IF it were possible the
[1:07:00] very elect will be saved. I mean will
[1:07:03] the very elect would be deceived. And so
[1:07:05] the word came to separate sharper than
[1:07:09] any two-edged sword piercing between
[1:07:13] truth and deception.
[1:07:18] How I thank God
[1:07:22] &gt;&gt; THAT HE WAS SUFFICIENT.
[1:07:23] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:07:24] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[1:07:26] &gt;&gt; HOW I THANK GOD HE PENETRATED
[1:07:30] &gt;&gt; THROUGH THE ENEMY'S CAMP.
[1:07:32] &gt;&gt; HOW I THANK GOD THAT HE DESCENDED IN
[1:07:36] SATAN'S EDEN AND FOUND ME.
[1:07:41] AMEN.
[1:07:43] &gt;&gt; HOW I THANK GOD HE PENETRATED THE
[1:07:47] DENOMINATIONAL BARRIER AND TORE THAT
[1:07:50] VEIL INTO
[1:07:53] &gt;&gt; AND EXPOSE THE MERCY SEAT ONCE AGAIN AND
[1:07:56] SAID HERE IT IS. HE'S ARRIVED. THE MERCY
[1:08:00] SEAT IS IN PLAIN VIEW.
[1:08:05] WHEN HE CAME IN FLESH AND HE WAS UH
[1:08:08] HANGING ON THE CROSS AND THE CRUCIFIXION
[1:08:11] AND THE MOST uh most unbelievable death
[1:08:15] marred more than that of any man. If
[1:08:17] you're going to look at it WITH YOUR
[1:08:19] EYES LOOKS LIKE A COMPLETE FAILURE. If
[1:08:22] you're going to listen to it with your
[1:08:23] ears, YOU'RE GOING TO HEAR CRUCIFY
[1:08:25] CRUCIFY GIVE US Barabbus and you might
[1:08:27] be influenced by that. If you were in if
[1:08:30] you were UH INFLUENCED BY THE MOB, YOU'D
[1:08:34] SURELY GET MOVED by that. And the PEOPLE
[1:08:36] WHO GOT HEALED, THE PEOPLE WHO ATE
[1:08:39] BREAD,
[1:08:40] &gt;&gt; CREATED FROM HIS HAND,
[1:08:43] &gt;&gt; DIDN'T SAY ANYTHING, didn't declare that
[1:08:45] they were with him. Oh, listen to me
[1:08:48] friends. BUT IT DIDN'T STOP HIM. HE
[1:08:51] PENETRATED THROUGH. And I THINK AFTER
[1:08:53] THE RESURRECTION, HE penetrated through
[1:08:56] the he HE HE PIERCED THROUGH the
[1:08:59] confusion
[1:09:01] &gt;&gt; of the two men on the way to Emmas. AND
[1:09:03] I DON'T CARE WHAT YOU THINK ABOUT THE
[1:09:05] MESSAGE. I DON'T CARE WHAT YOU THINK
[1:09:07] ABOUT WHAT YOU SEE HAPPENING. HE WILL
[1:09:09] PENETRATE THROUGH YOUR DISAPPOINTMENTS.
[1:09:13] &gt;&gt; HE WILL PENETRATE THROUGH YOUR
[1:09:15] CONFUSION. HE WILL PIERCE THROUGH YOUR
[1:09:18] DARK MOMENT. AND HE'LL STAY WITH YOU
[1:09:21] UNTIL YOU KNOW IT'S HIM.
[1:09:24] &gt;&gt; HE'LL STAY WITH YOU TILL YOU KNOW HE'S
[1:09:26] ARRIVED.
[1:09:28] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[1:09:29] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[1:09:31] &gt;&gt; THAT SWORD IS SO SHARP,
[1:09:33] &gt;&gt; THAT SWORD IS SO PIERCING. Even between
[1:09:36] your emotions, WHEN EVERYTHING YOU SEE,
[1:09:39] EVERYTHING YOU FEEL, EVERYTHING THAT
[1:09:41] GOES ON WITH ON THE INSIDE, HE'LL
[1:09:44] SEPARATE THAT. AND HE'LL GIVE YOU A
[1:09:46] MESSENGER BEHIND THE PULPIT. HE'LL GIVE
[1:09:49] YOU A MESSENGER TO SPEAK THROUGH THAT
[1:09:51] message and you'll hear his voice and
[1:09:54] you'll know it's God speaking.
[1:09:59] &gt;&gt; WHY? BECAUSE IT'LL SEPARATE YOU. And I
[1:10:02] tell you, young men, young ladies,
[1:10:06] men and women of this congregation, in
[1:10:09] this day and age, God hasn't given us 10
[1:10:12] ways. He hasn't given us five ways. He's
[1:10:16] given us one way. Amen.
[1:10:18] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. One faith,
[1:10:20] &gt;&gt; one word, one Lord, AND HE'LL SEPARATE
[1:10:23] YOU from the world that is SO
[1:10:26] TORMENTING. DON'T GIVE HIM, DON'T GIVE
[1:10:29] INTO your feelings. Well, I don't feel
[1:10:31] this. I DON'T FEEL THAT. FORGET WHAT YOU
[1:10:33] FEEL.
[1:10:34] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. IT HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH
[1:10:36] FAITH. IT'S NOT FEELINGS. IT'S FAITH.
[1:10:40] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. And if you can be moved, IF
[1:10:43] YOU CAN be moved by circumstance, HE
[1:10:46] WILL CREATE the circumstances to move
[1:10:48] you. But people of faith are not moved
[1:10:51] by circumstance.
[1:10:55] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:11:00] &gt;&gt; [snorts]
[1:11:01] &gt;&gt; And there shall arise false Christ and
[1:11:04] false prophets and shall show great
[1:11:07] signs and wonders in so much that if it
[1:11:10] were possible,
[1:11:12] that's how far he pierced through. If it
[1:11:15] were possible, this sword of this word
[1:11:19] of this message reaches right to that
[1:11:22] point. If it were possible, they shall
[1:11:25] deceive the very elect. This sword is so
[1:11:30] quick and powerful. It divides right to
[1:11:33] the point where it becomes impossible.
[1:11:39] &gt;&gt; Right to the point. ON THIS SIDE, IT'S
[1:11:42] POSSIBLE. ON THIS SIDE, it's impossible.
[1:11:46] &gt;&gt; It's impossible. IT'S IMPOSSIBLE TO
[1:11:50] DECEIVE the elect.
[1:11:53] &gt;&gt; I don't know about you, but I rejoice
[1:11:55] tonight.
[1:11:56] I REJOICE THAT WE DON'T HAVE TO TRY TO
[1:11:59] ATTAIN IT THAT WORD HAS COME.
[1:12:02] &gt;&gt; THAT CHRIST IS PRESENT.
[1:12:05] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. HE'S ALREADY HERE.
[1:12:07] &gt;&gt; AND YOU CAN DECLARE WITH A CONFIDENCE IN
[1:12:10] YOUR HEART ACCORDING TO THIS WORD. IF I
[1:12:13] JUST CAN FIND THAT PLACE, I CANNOT BE
[1:12:16] DECEIVED.
[1:12:17] &gt;&gt; And I say if I can find that place, the
[1:12:19] elect will find that place. GOD WILL PUT
[1:12:22] IT IN YOUR HEART THIS morning to hear
[1:12:24] this word, to hear this. I CAN SAY TO
[1:12:27] YOU, IT'S A BURDEN OF the word of the
[1:12:28] Lord. Not here to preach a service. I
[1:12:30] have a burden of the word of the Lord
[1:12:33] THAT YOU MIGHT RECEIVE IT, THAT YOU
[1:12:35] MIGHT OBTAIN WHAT GOD has given us for
[1:12:38] this day.
[1:12:40] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:12:42] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:12:44] pierced the veil
[1:12:46] &gt;&gt; of denominations,
[1:12:48] crying out, "Come out of her, my
[1:12:51] people."
[1:12:52] &gt;&gt; Piercing the veil of traditions
[1:12:55] &gt;&gt; and denominations. We've all been
[1:12:57] exposed to those things. And exposing
[1:13:00] the mercy seat in the unveiling of God,
[1:13:03] a prophet declares, "The whole mercy
[1:13:05] seats sitting in plain view. ANYBODY CAN
[1:13:09] SEE IT. The veils rent. Glory to God.
[1:13:14] The whole mercy seat comes into plain
[1:13:16] view. So I say, do you see it?
[1:13:19] &gt;&gt; Do you see the mercy seat?
[1:13:21] &gt;&gt; When the word was revealed, the word
[1:13:25] revealed is the mercy seat.
[1:13:32] &gt;&gt; YOU NEED TO ASK YOURSELF, DO I SEE THAT?
[1:13:35] DO I SEE NOT WITH THESE EYES, BUT DO I
[1:13:38] SEE THE MERCY SEAT? HAVE I OBTAINED THE
[1:13:40] MERCY THAT HAS COME IN THE UNVEILING OF
[1:13:42] GOD. FURTHER, he says how God could HAVE
[1:13:45] MERCY ON ON foul sinners as us. That's
[1:13:48] what the prophet says. On foul sinners
[1:13:50] as us when he hid himself was a mystery.
[1:13:54] And now it's in plain view
[1:13:57] &gt;&gt; or in full view.
[1:13:59] &gt;&gt; IT'S NOT ONLY IN PLAIN VIEW, IT'S IN
[1:14:01] FULL VIEW REVEALED BY HIS WORD. What is
[1:14:05] this word? His word of GOD IS SHARP AND
[1:14:09] POWERFUL, quick and powerful, sharper
[1:14:12] than any two-edged sword, piercing even
[1:14:14] to dividing a sunder. I'm preaching this
[1:14:17] hard, friends. I'm preaching with this
[1:14:19] much energy because I'm not going to
[1:14:21] stop till you see it.
[1:14:23] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. YOU CAN'T YOU CAN'T EXPECT
[1:14:25] ME TO GET IT ACROSS in an hour, hour and
[1:14:27] a half WHEN I'VE BEEN PONDERING THESE
[1:14:29] things for months.
[1:14:31] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. BUT THE WORD IS HERE. THE
[1:14:34] POWER IS HERE.
[1:14:36] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. AND IT'S A POWERFUL WORD.
[1:14:38] IT'S A QUICK WORD. IT'S A SHARP WORD.
[1:14:41] AND IT'LL DIVIDE US UNDER. I DON'T CARE
[1:14:43] WHAT YOU'RE TR TROUBLED WITH TODAY. THIS
[1:14:45] WORD TODAY COMING OVER THIS PULPIT WILL
[1:14:48] DIVIDE US FROM YOUR SITUATION, FROM YOUR
[1:14:52] CONFUSION, FROM YOUR DISAPPOINTMENTS.
[1:14:56] HALLELUJAH. THE WORD IS NOT AFFECTED BY
[1:14:58] DISAPPOINTMENTS. SO, I'M DISAPPOINTED.
[1:15:00] WE ALL HAVE HAD DISAPPOINTMENTS. BUT
[1:15:03] THAT'S NOT TO AFFECT OUR BELIEF.
[1:15:05] HALLELUJAH. MY FAITH IS STALWART. YOUR
[1:15:08] FAITH CANNOT BE MOVED. Glory to God.
[1:15:12] Glory to God. I SAY IN THE FACE OF EVERY
[1:15:15] CONFUSION, OF EVERY DISAPPOINTMENT, WE
[1:15:17] ALL HAVE DISAPPOINTMENT. I SAY IN THE
[1:15:20] NAME OF THE LORD, IT CANNOT MOVE US.
[1:15:27] &gt;&gt; Glory to God.
[1:15:30] Piercing through the piercing through
[1:15:33] the confusion of false teaching. My how
[1:15:36] we're so subjected to false teaching.
[1:15:39] All kinds of false teach. FALSE
[1:15:41] TEACHINGS INTRODUCED INTO THE MESSAGE.
[1:15:44] &gt;&gt; WHY? Because they don't only take one
[1:15:46] word away. Take many more than one word.
[1:15:48] I've had people say, "Brother Brandham
[1:15:49] said such and such." I go and search.
[1:15:51] Brother Brandham said nothing like that.
[1:15:54] &gt;&gt; WHAT IS IT? MAYBE THE PERSON IS
[1:15:56] INNOCENT. I DON'T I DON'T uh decianize
[1:15:59] the person, but I I have a right to
[1:16:02] believe what the prophet has said.
[1:16:04] &gt;&gt; I have a right to say what the word of
[1:16:07] God says.
[1:16:08] &gt;&gt; And if it and of something that's not in
[1:16:10] the word, then deny it. Just stay away
[1:16:13] FROM IT.
[1:16:14] &gt;&gt; BACK AWAY from it.
[1:16:15] &gt;&gt; Don't start to dialogue with it.
[1:16:17] &gt;&gt; Don't start to, you know, to have a
[1:16:19] discussion with it. THAT'LL ONLY LEAD
[1:16:22] deeper and deeper into the error.
[1:16:25] Right.
[1:16:30] &gt;&gt; I think that should be
[1:16:33] really followed.
[1:16:36] &gt;&gt; Don't don't don't don't start discussing
[1:16:39] things and you know if it's people want
[1:16:43] to believe what they want to believe
[1:16:44] that's fine.
[1:16:47] Piercing through disappointments from
[1:16:48] misunderstanding.
[1:16:50] &gt;&gt; Who's been more misunderstood than Jesus
[1:16:52] Christ himself?
[1:16:55] He said when they came came to his
[1:16:58] accusation and began to put him to the
[1:17:00] cross and call for his blood and they
[1:17:04] said what what was it? THEY SAID HE SAID
[1:17:07] HE'LL DESTROY THIS TEMPLE IN THREE DAYS
[1:17:10] AND RAISE IT UP IN THREE DAYS. WELL, he
[1:17:13] could have said you got me wrong.
[1:17:17] You don't understand what I was saying.
[1:17:20] I'm not referring to the temple you
[1:17:21] spent 46 years building. I'm referring
[1:17:24] to the temple of my body. The Bible
[1:17:26] SIMPLY SAYS HE SPAKE of the temple of
[1:17:28] his own body, BUT HE DIDN'T EXPLAIN IT
[1:17:30] TO THEM.
[1:17:32] &gt;&gt; He didn't enter into that dialogue
[1:17:34] because his mind, HIS WHOLE BEING WAS
[1:17:37] SET TO FULFILL THE WORD of God.
[1:17:40] &gt;&gt; And whatever NEEDS TO HAPPEN TODAY, WE
[1:17:42] SAY, "HERE I AM.
[1:17:44] &gt;&gt; GOD, DO WHATEVER you want to do with me.
[1:17:46] I'M HERE TO FULFILL THE FULFILL my
[1:17:49] purpose and to run this course with
[1:17:52] faith.
[1:17:52] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:17:54] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:17:55] So, we went back a wee bit to the
[1:17:58] beginning and found how Satan introduced
[1:18:04] himself into the human into humanity.
[1:18:08] And in the masterpiece, he said his
[1:18:11] enemy came in and found this great
[1:18:14] masterpiece. talking about the
[1:18:15] masterpiece family and by deceit he
[1:18:19] crawls under the garden walls. We may
[1:18:22] think of the garden, the garden of Eden,
[1:18:24] the garden walls, but he talks about the
[1:18:25] walls of the word. There was protected
[1:18:28] this enemy. And he's, if that was his
[1:18:31] nature back then, he's of the same mind
[1:18:34] this morning.
[1:18:35] &gt;&gt; If he can find a way to crawl under the
[1:18:38] walls that protect you. And the wall
[1:18:41] that protects you is this word.
[1:18:43] &gt;&gt; I'm going to really be heavy on this
[1:18:45] word. This word possesses what you need.
[1:18:48] Amen.
[1:18:49] &gt;&gt; This word has what you need.
[1:18:52] &gt;&gt; And what we have to find and and I want
[1:18:54] to strain stress this morning is h how
[1:18:57] we obtain that in a physical way. Maybe
[1:19:01] we need to not mechanically just listen
[1:19:04] to more message but it's how we approach
[1:19:07] it and how we hear. What do you hear
[1:19:09] when you hear it? What do you read? What
[1:19:11] do you see when you see it?
[1:19:15] And and then he asks uh he said he
[1:19:17] crawled under the garden wall and then
[1:19:20] he marred this beautiful masterpiece. He
[1:19:23] marred it so that it fell. He asks a
[1:19:27] little further down. How did he do it?
[1:19:30] When this masterpiece was walled by the
[1:19:33] word of God, God's word, you are walled
[1:19:38] by the same one.
[1:19:40] &gt;&gt; There isn't anything different between
[1:19:41] Adam and Eve and you and I. We're walled
[1:19:44] and protected by the same word. But if
[1:19:46] if Satan can succeed in making us think,
[1:19:49] well, it's for another time. It was
[1:19:51] another season, it's in the past, it's
[1:19:53] in the future, that's a lie. Don't let
[1:19:55] him introduce that to you. Say, well,
[1:19:58] there's a, you know, there's uh
[1:20:00] inconsistencies in the message, etc.
[1:20:02] There's no inconsistencies with the
[1:20:04] revelation.
[1:20:05] &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham said 700 when he meant
[1:20:08] 7,000 or whatever. One place talks about
[1:20:11] burning up the wheat instead of the
[1:20:12] chaff. Well, and then people make an
[1:20:14] issue. That's nonsense. That doesn't
[1:20:16] mean anything to me. It doesn't change
[1:20:18] the revelation of the word.
[1:20:20] &gt;&gt; What he said expose the Jesus Christ in
[1:20:24] the scripture. And what a transforming
[1:20:27] power
[1:20:28] &gt;&gt; it is.
[1:20:29] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. It's the revelation of the
[1:20:32] word. This message came to reveal
[1:20:35] Christ.
[1:20:37] And the revelation of Jesus Christ is
[1:20:39] not an error.
[1:20:41] &gt;&gt; It's not irreconcilable. It is
[1:20:43] absolutely true.
[1:20:46] &gt;&gt; Would you agree with that this morning?
[1:20:52] &gt;&gt; If you go out beyond the wall of the
[1:20:55] word, Satan has opportunity to mar the
[1:20:59] work of God. And I I cannot say that and
[1:21:02] stress that enough. I've seen people
[1:21:05] that have sat in this congregation that
[1:21:07] have gone out and they've gone out
[1:21:09] beyond the word of God. And when you go
[1:21:12] all out beyond the message of the hour
[1:21:15] that has been presented to us with
[1:21:18] vindication, then we are exposed
[1:21:21] exposing ourselves to all kinds of
[1:21:25] attack by the enemy
[1:21:28] &gt;&gt; in the spoken word. He said, ' Do you
[1:21:31] realize it was one word that Eve doubted
[1:21:35] that caused all the trouble? One spoken
[1:21:39] word of God. Now, Eve may have not heard
[1:21:44] the word not,
[1:21:46] but it was conveyed to her.
[1:21:50] And Satan's intent when God spoke and
[1:21:55] said, "You may eat, and this you may not
[1:21:58] touch." When God spoke, he had a certain
[1:22:01] intention for his children. When Satan,
[1:22:04] then the serpent, spoke and introduced
[1:22:08] something else to her, he had an
[1:22:10] intention. It wasn't just to get her to
[1:22:12] believe that, oh, I I can do that. No,
[1:22:16] it was the intent of creating her fall.
[1:22:23] &gt;&gt; That was his intent.
[1:22:26] &gt;&gt; His intent. Furthermore, I don't know if
[1:22:29] you're hope you're spiritually minded
[1:22:33] because God
[1:22:35] God
[1:22:38] the prophet said his great desire his
[1:22:42] first great desire in Christ the mystery
[1:22:44] of God revealed is to express himself.
[1:22:50] &gt;&gt; And the scripture tells us in Isaiah
[1:22:52] that Satan desired to be where God was.
[1:22:56] And the struggle today is Satan desires
[1:22:59] for expression.
[1:23:01] &gt;&gt; And when you walk down the streets of
[1:23:03] any city, what you'll find is an
[1:23:06] expression of Satan.
[1:23:08] &gt;&gt; Until we can actually say that's demons
[1:23:11] and flesh.
[1:23:15] &gt;&gt; No use fooling around with that,
[1:23:17] friends. That's devils and flesh.
[1:23:20] &gt;&gt; HELL HAS COME to the surface.
[1:23:25] You see it everywhere.
[1:23:29] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:23:31] &gt;&gt; And I want to say that the word has come
[1:23:34] to Satan's Eden.
[1:23:37] &gt;&gt; That's what I believe. I'm going to
[1:23:38] preach WHAT I BELIEVE.
[1:23:40] &gt;&gt; CHRIST, the word has come to Satan's
[1:23:42] Eden.
[1:23:44] &gt;&gt; And he WILL EXPRESS HIMSELF.
[1:23:46] &gt;&gt; AMEN. HE HAS CHOSEN HIS BRIDE and he's
[1:23:50] going to give her his seed and she's
[1:23:52] going to bring forth the manifestation
[1:23:53] of Jesus Christ. And we might say,
[1:23:56] "Well, I'm seeking to see the
[1:23:58] manifestation." You follow some of the
[1:24:00] things that I have to say here today and
[1:24:02] you'll see more of it. But we have you
[1:24:05] need people need to open their eyes to
[1:24:06] see that we have seen it.
[1:24:09] &gt;&gt; We do see it.
[1:24:12] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:24:16] one word that she doubted. He said Eve
[1:24:21] doubted to be the truth and it caused
[1:24:23] every sickness, every disease,
[1:24:27] every suffering baby caused every
[1:24:30] hospital to be built. Every operation
[1:24:33] was ever performed,
[1:24:36] every death that ever died for one
[1:24:39] person disbelieve one word, there you
[1:24:42] are. All right. If now that Eve doubted
[1:24:46] one word and caused all of that,
[1:24:49] if that is changed,
[1:24:53] &gt;&gt; if we reverse that
[1:24:55] &gt;&gt; and say there's a people, there's
[1:24:57] another woman
[1:24:59] &gt;&gt; on the earth.
[1:25:00] &gt;&gt; SHE'S THE BRIDE OF JESUS CHRIST.
[1:25:03] &gt;&gt; And she will believe every word.
[1:25:05] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:25:05] &gt;&gt; I MAY NOT UNDERSTAND EVERY WORD.
[1:25:08] &gt;&gt; I may not even be expecting a certain
[1:25:10] sound. But if I say in my heart, I
[1:25:12] believe every word. Amen.
[1:25:14] &gt;&gt; Then it's a it's an attitude, friends.
[1:25:17] &gt;&gt; It's an attitude.
[1:25:20] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:25:21] &gt;&gt; Then what what will it do?
[1:25:25] I'm probably going to I hope I don't
[1:25:27] fail in conveying this.
[1:25:30] There's more
[1:25:33] that the message, the actual word of the
[1:25:35] message, it's a word within a word. You
[1:25:38] can read a message. I have a message
[1:25:40] which I just printed off this morning.
[1:25:44] spiritual adoption. Just very very brief
[1:25:46] message, but there was something in
[1:25:48] there and I I had read it and it meant
[1:25:50] so much to me. So I wanted to I printed
[1:25:52] it out and I was reading it. And uh
[1:25:57] there's much more within the message.
[1:26:00] It's not just some words on a piece of
[1:26:04] paper. It's not even just some words
[1:26:07] that you will hear in the tape, but
[1:26:10] there's an intent of the author
[1:26:14] &gt;&gt; behind that word.
[1:26:16] &gt;&gt; There is a there is a a revelation. And
[1:26:19] I've said in previous services, I want
[1:26:21] to say it again. The revelation of what
[1:26:24] was spoken,
[1:26:27] that is the interpretation. That is the
[1:26:29] voice of God to the individual. Does
[1:26:32] that go over your head? You understand?
[1:26:35] Something that's revealed is something
[1:26:37] that wasn't known before.
[1:26:39] &gt;&gt; And so when God speaks through his word,
[1:26:44] even through a service that's being
[1:26:46] preached or you hear a tape or you read
[1:26:49] a scripture or you read a message book
[1:26:52] and then and then something comes alive
[1:26:56] &gt;&gt; that's quick.
[1:26:58] &gt;&gt; It's quickened.
[1:26:59] &gt;&gt; It comes alive.
[1:27:01] &gt;&gt; Then you need to ponder that.
[1:27:04] You need to take and absorb that.
[1:27:07] &gt;&gt; Say, "What are you trying to absorb?"
[1:27:08] I'm trying to absorb the content.
[1:27:12] &gt;&gt; Not what my mind can wrestle with, but
[1:27:14] the content.
[1:27:15] &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham says faith is
[1:27:17] unconscious.
[1:27:18] &gt;&gt; You might think that this, you know, you
[1:27:21] might think that I'm going way sideways
[1:27:23] here, but I I I want you to I want you
[1:27:25] to I want to convey this to you.
[1:27:30] Amen.
[1:27:32] &gt;&gt; There's a content.
[1:27:35] &gt;&gt; And the prophet says that faith is
[1:27:37] unconscious.
[1:27:40] &gt;&gt; You may not even be aware that it's
[1:27:43] happening,
[1:27:44] &gt;&gt; but your attitude,
[1:27:46] &gt;&gt; your approach
[1:27:48] &gt;&gt; makes it available to you.
[1:27:51] &gt;&gt; AND THEN YOU'LL FIND OUT down the road,
[1:27:55] what did I do? What did I do to gain
[1:27:59] this
[1:28:00] glorious honor? The answer to my prayer.
[1:28:05] &gt;&gt; What did I do?
[1:28:06] &gt;&gt; You didn't really do anything. It may
[1:28:09] have just been the way you approached
[1:28:11] it. I I must not get ahead of myself.
[1:28:19] [clears throat]
[1:28:22] I've been around some
[1:28:24] believers. I don't want to spend a lot
[1:28:25] of time on this, but they're very
[1:28:27] affected by dreams.
[1:28:30] That's fine. We all have dreams, but
[1:28:32] don't count on them.
[1:28:34] Don't count on them. I've had good ones
[1:28:36] and bad ones in the last two weeks. And
[1:28:39] I'm not up here preaching dreams.
[1:28:42] &gt;&gt; I've been around people before I'm done,
[1:28:44] they've told me two or three dreams, and
[1:28:46] those dreams of influencing their life
[1:28:48] and so on so forth. I say they'd be
[1:28:50] better off if they stayed awake and read
[1:28:51] a message.
[1:28:53] Yes, sir.
[1:28:54] &gt;&gt; Then you go to sleep and have a dream.
[1:28:58] [clears throat]
[1:28:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:29:02] &gt;&gt; What is the word of God? I asked
[1:29:04] Wednesday. I've asked in the previous
[1:29:06] service. What is the word of God?
[1:29:12] The word of God, listen closely now, is
[1:29:16] the self-revelation
[1:29:19] of the one true God
[1:29:22] &gt;&gt; to those individuals of his choosing.
[1:29:27] &gt;&gt; Shall I say that again?
[1:29:31] &gt;&gt; The word of God, that's what the word of
[1:29:33] God is in my and I've spent a lot of
[1:29:36] time on this. The word of God is the
[1:29:38] self-revelation of God.
[1:29:41] &gt;&gt; He reveals himself as a self-revelation
[1:29:44] of God to of the one true God to those
[1:29:49] specific individuals. Call them elect,
[1:29:51] call them whatever you want,
[1:29:52] &gt;&gt; to the individuals of his own choosing.
[1:29:56] &gt;&gt; If he chooses to make himself known
[1:29:59] &gt;&gt; to an individual, THAT'S IT.
[1:30:05] ALL YOU WANT TO SAY IS LET IT BE me
[1:30:07] Lord.
[1:30:09] &gt;&gt; Here I am.
[1:30:14] &gt;&gt; What is the word of God?
[1:30:17] It's his self-revelation.
[1:30:20] And secondly, by whatever means
[1:30:25] he chooses to reveal or make himself
[1:30:27] known.
[1:30:28] &gt;&gt; That's right. Prophet said in the
[1:30:30] unveiling of God he used a whirlwind
[1:30:33] pillar of fire
[1:30:35] struck struck Paul down with a great
[1:30:38] light. He chose the time.
[1:30:42] &gt;&gt; He chose the place.
[1:30:44] &gt;&gt; And Paul was struck down by transforming
[1:30:47] power.
[1:30:48] &gt;&gt; HE WAS TRANSFORMED.
[1:30:51] &gt;&gt; WHY? What was what was was the
[1:30:53] transformation power in the light or was
[1:30:56] it in the voice that spoke to him?
[1:30:59] I would say it's a combination of that
[1:31:02] plus his approach by ye by uh by
[1:31:07] confessing that this has to be the
[1:31:09] presence of God.
[1:31:11] &gt;&gt; Who art thou Lord?
[1:31:13] &gt;&gt; Yes sir.
[1:31:16] &gt;&gt; Am I getting through to you?
[1:31:19] &gt;&gt; SO IT'S NOT JUST A MESSAGE BOOK. IT'S
[1:31:21] NOT JUST A TAPE. IT'S NOT JUST IT'S NOT
[1:31:23] JUST THE BIBLE,
[1:31:25] but it is what do we DO WHEN GOD SAYS
[1:31:29] something to us through it,
[1:31:33] &gt;&gt; speaks to us.
[1:31:37] I've I I'm coming home. I'm coming home
[1:31:39] to where people live. I've seen meetings
[1:31:41] where people been greatly moved.
[1:31:44] &gt;&gt; I've seen this altar full of people.
[1:31:47] I've seen young people weep and and
[1:31:50] shout and and have an
[1:31:53] wonderful. WHERE ARE YOU TODAY?
[1:31:59] &gt;&gt; Where are you this morning?
[1:32:03] &gt;&gt; What did you do with it?
[1:32:09] &gt;&gt; Come on, folks.
[1:32:10] &gt;&gt; What do we do with it?
[1:32:13] &gt;&gt; WAS IT GOD
[1:32:15] &gt;&gt; OR WASN'T it God? And if it was God,
[1:32:18] WHAT DID YOU DO WITH IT?
[1:32:21] &gt;&gt; DID HE SPEAK? YES.
[1:32:23] &gt;&gt; YOU SAY HE SPOKE. WHAT DID YOU DO WITH
[1:32:25] THE WORD?
[1:32:28] &gt;&gt; AND YOU SIT HERE TODAY AND SAY, "WELL, I
[1:32:30] WANT GOD TO DO SOMETHING." GOD WANTS YOU
[1:32:32] TO DO SOMETHING.
[1:32:33] &gt;&gt; HE WANTS YOU TO APPROACH IT WITH
[1:32:35] REVERENCE.
[1:32:36] &gt;&gt; HE WANTS YOU TO APPROACH IT WITH GREAT
[1:32:38] LOVE
[1:32:39] &gt;&gt; AND SAY, "THAT WAS REALITY." AND I WILL
[1:32:42] NEVER LET THAT GO.
[1:32:44] I DON'T CARE WHAT KIND OF TEMPTATION
[1:32:46] COMES MY WAY. I DON'T CARE WHAT KIND OF
[1:32:49] HARDSHIP COMES MY WAY. I DON'T CARE WHAT
[1:32:51] KIND OF DISAPPOINTMENTS. AND LISTEN TO
[1:32:53] ME, YOUNG PEOPLE. AND I CERTAINLY DON'T
[1:32:55] CARE WHAT THE NEXT GUY DOES.
[1:32:58] [applause]
[1:33:00] &gt;&gt; I'M SO TIRED OF HEARING, "WELL, MY
[1:33:02] FRIEND, WHO CARES? MAYBE THEY'RE NOT
[1:33:04] YOUR FRIENDS."
[1:33:07] &gt;&gt; I mean, YOUR FRIENDS ARE GIVING YOU THAT
[1:33:09] KIND OF INFLUENCE. IF THEY GIVE YOU THAT
[1:33:11] KIND OF INFLUENCE, THEY'RE CERTAINLY NOT
[1:33:13] YOUR FRIENDS.
[1:33:15] &gt;&gt; IT'S SATAN TRYING TO TAKE YOU TO HELL.
[1:33:19] &gt;&gt; That's what it is.
[1:33:20] &gt;&gt; WHAT DO WE DO WITH IT?
[1:33:23] &gt;&gt; THEN WE SAY, "WELL, I WANT TO SEE GOD DO
[1:33:25] SOMETHING." LET YOURSELF BE IN A PLACE
[1:33:27] WHERE HE CAN DO SOMETHING.
[1:33:30] &gt;&gt; GOD IS RIGHT HERE.
[1:33:39] Hang on.
[1:33:46] &gt;&gt; Your approach
[1:33:48] to the divine gift
[1:33:51] brings the results.
[1:33:53] &gt;&gt; Now, don't make the terrible mistake of
[1:33:56] saying, "Oh, it was back there when
[1:33:57] brother Brandham was here."
[1:33:59] I tell you what, if God has not given
[1:34:02] the five-fold ministry to the church,
[1:34:04] and that five-fold ministry is divine
[1:34:07] gifts to the church,
[1:34:10] &gt;&gt; any man who gives himself to prayer and
[1:34:12] to study and to minister the word of
[1:34:15] God, he if he he might do it for a
[1:34:17] living if that's what his mind is set
[1:34:19] on, but otherwise, it's a divine gift
[1:34:22] that God sends to the church. It's a
[1:34:24] it's an excruciating, painful,
[1:34:28] burdensome because you're bearing
[1:34:29] burdens and and we're concerned ABOUT
[1:34:32] PEOPLE. AND THAT'S WHY WE STAND HERE AND
[1:34:34] PREACH. WE DECLARE THE TRUTH. WE'RE NOT
[1:34:37] TRYING TO GET, you know, a gold star on
[1:34:40] our on our book. THAT'S NOT WHAT WE'RE
[1:34:43] HERE FOR. WE'RE HERE TO EVEN SAY THINGS
[1:34:45] SOMETIMES IS COMING TO CHURCH. I WONDER
[1:34:48] and I'm sure brother John, brother Tom,
[1:34:50] brother Ernie who, brother Andy's senior
[1:34:54] and and and you AS AN INDIVIDUAL
[1:34:56] SOMETIME as parents, as a father, as a
[1:34:59] mother, you have to say things to your
[1:35:01] children that ARE HARD TO SAY, BUT YOU
[1:35:04] KNOW IT'S TRUE.
[1:35:05] &gt;&gt; SO I SAY SAY IT.
[1:35:08] &gt;&gt; IF YOU KNOW IT'S TRUTH, JUST SAY IT.
[1:35:12] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[1:35:15] And a and a prophet says in the
[1:35:17] believest thou this he said it's your
[1:35:19] approach.
[1:35:21] &gt;&gt; So I want to stay with that. IT'S YOUR
[1:35:23] APPROACH to a divine gift.
[1:35:26] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:35:29] &gt;&gt; That brings the results.
[1:35:32] &gt;&gt; Oh my goodness. WE'RE INTERESTED IN
[1:35:34] RESULTS.
[1:35:36] &gt;&gt; WHO DOESN'T WANT RESULTS?
[1:35:39] BUT HE SAYS IT'S YOUR APPROACH
[1:35:41] &gt;&gt; TO THE DIVINE GIFT,
[1:35:43] &gt;&gt; NOT A GIFT OF, YOU KNOW, A THOUSAND
[1:35:45] YEARS AGO OR 50 YEARS AGO OR A GIFT THAT
[1:35:48] MIGHT COME. THE GIFT OF GOD THAT'S WITH
[1:35:51] YOU.
[1:35:53] &gt;&gt; I believe that A GOOD GODLY WIFE
[1:35:55] ACCORDING to the prophet's message IS A
[1:35:57] DIVINE GIFT. AMEN.
[1:35:59] &gt;&gt; AND FOR A WIFE TO HAVE A HUSBAND THAT
[1:36:01] SEEKS TO BE A PROTECTOR AND WANTS TO BE
[1:36:03] A SPIRITUAL HEAD TO THE HOME AND WANTS
[1:36:06] TO BE AN EXAMPLE TO THE CHILDREN, THAT'S
[1:36:08] A DIVINE GIFT.
[1:36:12] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:36:14] &gt;&gt; Don't sit here and put it elsewhere.
[1:36:17] &gt;&gt; Don't use a shovel. Use a rake
[1:36:20] &gt;&gt; and PULL IT IN.
[1:36:21] &gt;&gt; SAY THAT BELONGS TO ME.
[1:36:24] &gt;&gt; THAT APPLIES TO MY SITUATION.
[1:36:27] HALLELUJAH.
[1:36:31] &gt;&gt; In the ministry of Christ, he spoke of
[1:36:33] this woman. ARE YOU STILL WITH ME?
[1:36:36] &gt;&gt; He said she pressed right through.
[1:36:40] Never paid any attention. THERE ISN'T
[1:36:43] ANYBODY HERE THAT DOESN'T HAVE TO PUSH
[1:36:46] STUFF ASIDE. PRESS through the unbelief.
[1:36:51] And I said, SPEAKING ESPECIALLY TO THE
[1:36:53] YOUNG PEOPLE just for this moment, YOU
[1:36:55] HAVE TO PRESS THROUGH ALL THE PEER
[1:36:57] PRESSURE. I READ THE QUESTIONS. Brother
[1:37:00] John, thank you for sending ALL THE
[1:37:01] QUESTIONS THAT THE YOUNG PEOPLE
[1:37:03] DISCUSSED. I CAN TELL you the answer to
[1:37:06] almost every one of THOSE QUESTIONS IS
[1:37:08] YOUR ATTITUDE towards the word of God.
[1:37:12] If you have the RIGHT ATTITUDE, THAT
[1:37:14] STUFF, YOU'LL BRUSH IT ASIDE. YOU SAY,
[1:37:16] "I DON'T CARE WHAT MY FRIENDS DO. I
[1:37:19] DON'T CARE WHAT WEAKNESS I SEE IN THE
[1:37:21] MINISTRY. I DON'T CARE ABOUT WHAT I HEAR
[1:37:23] ABOUT THE MESSAGE. IN FACT IS I DON'T
[1:37:26] CARE ABOUT ANYTHING EXCEPT THIS WORD OF
[1:37:28] GOD. I KNOW THAT'S God's word.
[1:37:32] &gt;&gt; GOD VINDICATED THIS WORD.
[1:37:36] &gt;&gt; And if you don't THINK ABOUT ANYTHING
[1:37:37] ELSE, JUST THINK ABOUT THAT VINDICATION.
[1:37:39] I HAVE FOR YEARS. I have since I was 17,
[1:37:42] 18 years old. The same vindication. I
[1:37:45] would just lay THERE AND WEEP. WHY ARE
[1:37:47] YOU DOING THIS? WHY DO WHY HAVE YOU COME
[1:37:50] DOWN HERE? WHY HAVE YOU DONE WHY ARE YOU
[1:37:53] REVEALING THE SECRET OF THE HEART IN
[1:37:54] REVEALING THEIR HEART? YOU REVEAL MY OWN
[1:37:56] HEART.
[1:37:58] &gt;&gt; AND MY HEART IS REVEALED. I LOVE THIS.
[1:38:01] &gt;&gt; I don't know. I CAN'T EXPLAIN IT, BUT I
[1:38:03] LOVE THIS ATMOSPHERE.
[1:38:05] &gt;&gt; IT'S SO MUCH LIKE JESUS CHRIST. AND IT
[1:38:07] TOOK ME YEARS TO FIND OUT IT WAS JESUS
[1:38:09] CHRIST.
[1:38:12] &gt;&gt; I'm so moved by it. Amen.
[1:38:14] &gt;&gt; And when you FALL IN LOVE WITH HIM, GOOD
[1:38:17] THINGS ARE GOING TO HAPPEN.
[1:38:23] &gt;&gt; And another thing, DON'T GET JEALOUS
[1:38:24] BECAUSE YOU SEE SOMEONE ELSE DOING THE
[1:38:27] RIGHT THING AND THEY FALL UNDER THE
[1:38:28] BLESSING OF GOD. SAY, "HOW DID THEY GET
[1:38:31] THAT WIFE? HOW DID THEY GET THAT
[1:38:32] HUSBAND? HOW COME THEY GOT GOOD THINGS?
[1:38:35] HOW COME THIS GOOD THING'S HAPPENING?"
[1:38:37] BECAUSE THEY HAVE THE RIGHT ATTITUDE
[1:38:38] TOWARD THE WORD.
[1:38:41] And then you see PEOPLE GOING THROUGH
[1:38:43] TERRIBLE TIME,
[1:38:45] terrible time. And God allows his
[1:38:48] children TO GO THROUGH TERRIBLE TIMES.
[1:38:50] But that person who's who's anchored,
[1:38:54] THAT PERSON WHO'S WALKING BY FAITH, that
[1:38:56] person who's walking by the relationship
[1:38:59] even though they come to disappointments
[1:39:00] and you and your friend are on the way
[1:39:02] to Emmas and say, "YOU KNOW WHAT? THIS
[1:39:05] MESSAGE HAS FAILED US. HERE WE COUNTED
[1:39:08] on it. here. He made BREAD AND WE
[1:39:10] THOUGHT HE'S GOING TO BE A KING AND ALL
[1:39:12] THESE WONDERFUL THINGS AND NOW IT'S ALL
[1:39:14] DRIBBLED AWAY. IT'S ALL EVAPORATED. AND
[1:39:18] RIGHT WHILE HE THOUGHT IT ALL
[1:39:19] EVAPORATED, THE GREATEST THING WAS
[1:39:21] WALKING RIGHT BESIDE THEM.
[1:39:24] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[1:39:25] &gt;&gt; And I WANT TO SAY TO YOU IN THIS CHURCH
[1:39:27] THIS MORNING, NOT BECAUSE IT'S
[1:39:29] CLOVERDALE BIBLE WAY, BUT BECAUSE WE
[1:39:31] HAVE A RESPECT TO THAT MESSAGE. I HAVE A
[1:39:34] RESPECT TO THAT MESSAGE. AND IF GOD HAS
[1:39:36] DONE ANYTHING good to this congregation
[1:39:38] or anything, allowed us any place in his
[1:39:40] kingdom, IT'S BECAUSE WE RESPECT HAVE
[1:39:43] THAT RESPECT FOR THAT MESSAGE.
[1:39:46] &gt;&gt; Glory to God. I RESPECT it more than you
[1:39:49] PEOPLE REALIZE. I LOVE THAT MESSAGE WITH
[1:39:52] all my heart.
[1:39:53] &gt;&gt; TO ME, IT'S THE PERSON OF JESUS CHRIST
[1:39:56] &gt;&gt; WALKING here in 2012.
[1:39:58] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[1:40:00] &gt;&gt; HEALING LIKE HE ALWAYS DID, brother
[1:40:01] Ricardo. Glory to God.
[1:40:06] I
[1:40:06] &gt;&gt; tell you what friends, if I told you
[1:40:07] what God is doing and what he is saying,
[1:40:10] some of you would it would it would
[1:40:12] surprise you
[1:40:15] &gt;&gt; big time.
[1:40:16] &gt;&gt; Surprise you.
[1:40:18] &gt;&gt; God God is doing things on a regular
[1:40:20] basis.
[1:40:22] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:40:24] &gt;&gt; And so he said in the Queen of Sheba, he
[1:40:27] said, "Well, it depends on what you
[1:40:29] think it is." It depends on what you
[1:40:32] think it is. Not only back then he was
[1:40:34] saying it the approach to the divine
[1:40:36] gift. I'm going to lay it out. It's
[1:40:39] actually the respect for the ministry
[1:40:41] that God gave them. And we still have
[1:40:43] that same ministry.
[1:40:45] &gt;&gt; If we're not here in support of this
[1:40:47] messenger's ministry, we might as well
[1:40:49] close the doors and go home. We're here.
[1:40:53] &gt;&gt; You may even wonder about the school.
[1:40:55] What's the school all about? It is I
[1:40:58] just in hopes. It's in hopes and in
[1:41:00] trust and in belief that we'll have Holy
[1:41:03] Ghost teachers that will that will
[1:41:05] INSTRUCT THE CHILDREN AND GIVE THEM AN
[1:41:07] atmosphere
[1:41:09] &gt;&gt; for THEM TO RESPOND IN.
[1:41:20] He said, "It depends." He's speaking to
[1:41:21] a woman. "It depends on what you think
[1:41:24] it is."
[1:41:27] Now, try to get this. If you think it's
[1:41:30] If you think it's a evil devil,
[1:41:34] then you get his reward.
[1:41:37] If you believe that it's the Lord Jesus
[1:41:41] according to his promise,
[1:41:43] what I've been preaching, then you have
[1:41:46] his reward.
[1:41:48] Both rewards were present are present.
[1:41:53] Both those rewards are present this
[1:41:55] morning.
[1:42:00] &gt;&gt; I don't put myself in that prophec.
[1:42:08] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:42:12] &gt;&gt; I prayed for a man this morning. He's
[1:42:15] not able to be here right now. But I
[1:42:18] prayed for him. I never prayed for him
[1:42:21] like this before.
[1:42:24] But my heart was moved and I said, "God,
[1:42:28] I need him. I need him. His life has
[1:42:32] influenced me. His life has affected me
[1:42:36] and I ask you to allow him to be here.
[1:42:40] Bring him here." That was my prayer this
[1:42:42] morning.
[1:42:43] I'm so thankful. I have been moved. I
[1:42:47] I've been moved by my own family. I've
[1:42:51] been moved by the family of God. Your
[1:42:53] life has influenced me. I like I I love
[1:42:58] to see I've been working with some of
[1:43:00] you young men and I just observe h how
[1:43:04] you do things and how you move about and
[1:43:08] how resilient you are and how respectful
[1:43:11] you are. God sees that.
[1:43:14] &gt;&gt; Absolutely sees that. Maybe you're not
[1:43:16] walking just exactly where you want to
[1:43:18] be. God sees that, too. Maybe everything
[1:43:20] isn't happening just the way you want it
[1:43:22] to happen. God sees that as well. But if
[1:43:25] you have this, if you have that kind of
[1:43:27] respect
[1:43:28] &gt;&gt; to God's word,
[1:43:29] &gt;&gt; you'll come out of that situation.
[1:43:33] &gt;&gt; The word will penetrate. It will pierce
[1:43:37] &gt;&gt; between your disappointment
[1:43:40] &gt;&gt; and what I don't CARE WHAT THE SOURCE of
[1:43:42] the disappointment is, but it will
[1:43:43] pierce through
[1:43:45] &gt;&gt; and the piercing will make you aware
[1:43:47] someone else is here.
[1:43:50] &gt;&gt; This is a different kind of a stranger
[1:43:52] that's walking with me.
[1:43:55] &gt;&gt; Is it all right, folks? Amen.
[1:44:04] &gt;&gt; You can just put this in your heart and
[1:44:06] you go home and figure it out.
[1:44:10] It depends what you think this is.
[1:44:15] Said, "Well, is it just Brother Ed down
[1:44:16] there yelling?"
[1:44:20] You know, and I'm kind of I don't know
[1:44:24] where he's at.
[1:44:28] tell you when the prophet of God spoke
[1:44:29] the seals nobody knew where he was at
[1:44:32] &gt;&gt; but how much we've gotten out of it
[1:44:34] today
[1:44:36] &gt;&gt; and then he said there will be others
[1:44:37] that will take this message
[1:44:39] &gt;&gt; and I just announced to you I'm one of
[1:44:41] those
[1:44:42] &gt;&gt; and there may be other brethren here
[1:44:44] that are one of them
[1:44:46] &gt;&gt; and we are all here as one body we're
[1:44:48] all here to proclaim what does this
[1:44:50] church and what does this congregation
[1:44:52] do I've been going over the last 40
[1:44:54] years and and and and you don't have
[1:44:58] enough time today and you don't have
[1:44:59] enough time this week. My wife, she just
[1:45:02] going she's got a little calendar and
[1:45:04] she keeps it little Hallmark calendars
[1:45:06] and puts on that we're going to Norway
[1:45:09] and then we're go going from there to to
[1:45:12] South Africa and going from there over
[1:45:14] to India and so on so forth. And I said,
[1:45:16] I got tired reading reading that. And I
[1:45:20] read this morning where brother Brandham
[1:45:23] went by went by train or something. Went
[1:45:26] by went all the way to California and
[1:45:28] preached and preached again and took
[1:45:30] 60some hours getting back home by train.
[1:45:33] I don't even know. And he says that's
[1:45:35] day before yesterday and I'm he said I
[1:45:37] I've been, you know, just so exhausted
[1:45:40] and I I I I sometime here you can do
[1:45:44] that. You just read the message yourself
[1:45:46] and see where that message was and
[1:45:48] realize where he is the next night and
[1:45:50] the next night and the next night and
[1:45:53] that he either drove and sometimes he
[1:45:55] drove almost every time from one place
[1:45:57] to another to another. It was just
[1:45:59] absolutely incredible. THIS MESSAGE HAS
[1:46:03] NOT COME to us cheap.
[1:46:06] &gt;&gt; This message has come to US AT GREAT
[1:46:08] COST. WE DON'T HAVE TO TALK ABOUT 68
[1:46:10] million who gave their lives. PEOPLE
[1:46:12] HAVE GIVEN THEIR LIVES ALL DOWN THROUGH
[1:46:14] THE YEARS AND YOU'RE GIVING YOUR LIFE.
[1:46:16] And the prophet said, "It's not only
[1:46:18] those who gave their life, gave their
[1:46:20] life and was martyed, but those who have
[1:46:23] lived
[1:46:24] &gt;&gt; and given their lives AND YOU'RE HERE
[1:46:27] AND YOU'RE ALIVE.
[1:46:28] &gt;&gt; We are CALLED ON BY GOD. GIVE OUR LIFE.
[1:46:32] &gt;&gt; WHATEVER IT IS YOU'RE
[1:46:34] &gt;&gt; God has put IN YOUR HANDS. GIVE YOUR
[1:46:36] lifemen
[1:46:38] &gt;&gt; without any hesitation. I wish I had the
[1:46:41] use of some of you young men, you young
[1:46:43] ladies. I'll tell you what, there's a
[1:46:46] fire burning in my soul. It's not an old
[1:46:49] fire. It's a young firemen.
[1:46:51] &gt;&gt; And I've had that fire since a young man
[1:46:54] &gt;&gt; and I'm TRYING TO PASS IT OFF. SOMEONE
[1:46:56] HAS TO PICK UP PICK UP THIS
[1:46:58] RESPONSIBILITY. And your parents are
[1:47:00] gaining age and they're they're getting
[1:47:03] older as well. YOU YOU YOUNG LADIES, YOU
[1:47:06] WANT TO BE THE KIND OF YOUNG WOMEN, the
[1:47:08] kind of mothers that Jesus Christ is
[1:47:11] proud of,
[1:47:12] &gt;&gt; THAT PLEASES HIM. AND YOU'LL FIND IN
[1:47:15] YOUR GREAT HOUR OF YOUR GREAT hour of
[1:47:18] trial and sorrow. I talked about Sister
[1:47:21] Larga. Don't forget, friends, she lost a
[1:47:24] husband. DON'T FORGET that she had years
[1:47:27] of bringing up those babies and those
[1:47:29] children. She had years where she didn't
[1:47:31] even know where her next meal was coming
[1:47:33] from. BUT ONE THING NEVER CHANGED. THIS
[1:47:36] MESSAGE AND HER APPROACH TO THIS
[1:47:38] MESSAGE. AND SOMEHOW I want TO ANNOUNCE
[1:47:40] TO YOU, GOD SMILED ON THAT WOMAN. GOD
[1:47:43] SMILED IN THAT HOME.
[1:47:45] &gt;&gt; And this is not to be a discouragement
[1:47:47] to anybody, but there isn't one of those
[1:47:49] young people. OF THE WHOLE EIGHT OF
[1:47:51] THEM, NONE OF THEM WENT TO THE WORLD.
[1:47:54] NONE OF THEM EVEN CRAVE THE WORLD. NONE
[1:47:57] OF THEM ARE INTERESTED in the world.
[1:47:59] LISTEN FRIENDS, THAT'S NOT JUST A FAVOR
[1:48:01] FOR ONE PERSON. THAT IS PRESENT HERE FOR
[1:48:04] YOU AND I.
[1:48:06] &gt;&gt; I say in the name of Jesus Christ, LET
[1:48:10] THE WORLD BE CUT AWAY FROM YOU.
[1:48:13] &gt;&gt; DON'T HAVE ANY INTEREST IN THEIR
[1:48:14] FASHION.
[1:48:15] &gt;&gt; DON'T HAVE ANY INTEREST IN THEIR
[1:48:17] ENTERTAINMENT.
[1:48:18] &gt;&gt; DON'T HAVE ANY INTEREST IN THE THINGS
[1:48:20] THAT THEY DO.
[1:48:21] &gt;&gt; BECAUSE THE WAGES OF SIN ARE DEATH,
[1:48:24] &gt;&gt; BUT THE GIFT OF GOD IS ETERNAL LIFE.
[1:48:29] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. AMEN.
[1:48:30] &gt;&gt; In the face of every defeat, in the face
[1:48:32] of every foe, we declare victory.
[1:48:44] &gt;&gt; Our attitude to the divine word.
[1:48:47] [snorts]
[1:48:49] I have here my note. Jesus was the word.
[1:48:52] He is the word. And the attitude that
[1:48:55] people took towards
[1:48:57] his person.
[1:49:00] his person was in fact their attitude to
[1:49:04] the thoughts of God regarding the
[1:49:07] redemption of the world.
[1:49:11] So the attitude that people had towards
[1:49:13] his person
[1:49:18] was
[1:49:22] in fact their attitude to the thoughts
[1:49:24] of God for he was the expression of the
[1:49:26] thoughts of God.
[1:49:29] It depends on what you think.
[1:49:34] Brother Brandham and Jesus Christ the
[1:49:36] same yesterday. Do you have a few more
[1:49:37] minutes? Amen.
[1:49:39] &gt;&gt; He said, "If this woman standing here, a
[1:49:43] stranger to me, I don't know her and she
[1:49:47] don't know me,
[1:49:49] God knows her."
[1:49:50] &gt;&gt; Well, then the only way I'd have knowing
[1:49:54] anything,
[1:49:56] what she was here for would have to
[1:49:58] come, listen close, would have to come
[1:50:01] from some supernatural
[1:50:04] resource. That's what always has
[1:50:06] affected me.
[1:50:08] &gt;&gt; That supernatural
[1:50:10] resource.
[1:50:13] Where does this come from?
[1:50:15] &gt;&gt; I know it comes from God because it's
[1:50:18] holy.
[1:50:19] &gt;&gt; I know it comes from God because it it
[1:50:21] has a it bears the a trademark of the
[1:50:25] humility of Jesus Christ. Amen.
[1:50:30] &gt;&gt; Gordon Lindsay's daughter or wife was
[1:50:32] standing. Says a little 1930s car pulled
[1:50:36] up. She's at the sink looking out the
[1:50:38] window and a man steps out and she said
[1:50:42] it was just a such a spirit of humility
[1:50:45] overwhelmed her inside the house over
[1:50:47] the kitchen
[1:50:48] &gt;&gt; and she broke into weeping
[1:50:51] &gt;&gt; and wept.
[1:50:53] The same man reached behind a door where
[1:50:56] my wife was standing as a girl 12 years
[1:50:58] old and shook her hand, stopped and came
[1:51:02] back a step or two and shook her hand.
[1:51:05] Could have been any one of you girls.
[1:51:08] God bless you little sister
[1:51:10] &gt;&gt; at 12 years old
[1:51:13] said
[1:51:16] give your way to the to the Lord and he
[1:51:21] will direct your path
[1:51:23] &gt;&gt; and he will give you the desire of your
[1:51:25] heart
[1:51:27] and he went on in the crowd and the rush
[1:51:30] and she stood behind the door and just
[1:51:34] presence come over and she just begin to
[1:51:36] weep.
[1:51:40] Did the weeping do it? No.
[1:51:43] It was the presence.
[1:51:45] &gt;&gt; And now you see a woman that is in her
[1:51:47] 70s, but that has never left.
[1:51:51] &gt;&gt; That respect HAS NEVER LEFT. THAT
[1:51:53] ATTITUDE has never left. And I'm seeking
[1:51:56] and admonishing you. YOU CAN HAVE THE
[1:51:58] SAME APPROACH.
[1:52:01] &gt;&gt; Say amen, folks.
[1:52:03] &gt;&gt; YOU'RE IN NEED.
[1:52:06] YOU'RE IN NEED.
[1:52:08] &gt;&gt; WE'RE IN NEED. WE WANT TO SEE GOD DO
[1:52:10] THINGS. THIS IS HOW YOU HAVE TO START.
[1:52:15] &gt;&gt; THE WOMAN IS THERE. SHE DOESN'T HAVE THE
[1:52:18] ANSWER.
[1:52:19] SAY IT DEPENDS ON WHAT YOU THINK THIS
[1:52:23] IS. I'M BRINGING IT HOME. WHAT DO YOU
[1:52:26] THINK THIS IS?
[1:52:27] &gt;&gt; WELL, I think I'm in church. It's got to
[1:52:29] You got to think a lot more than that.
[1:52:32] &gt;&gt; Well, I think that it's been a long
[1:52:34] service. You got to think a whole lot
[1:52:35] more than that. And you got to think a
[1:52:37] whole lot different than that.
[1:52:40] &gt;&gt; Well, I think brother ED'S NOT GETTING
[1:52:41] HIS POINT ACROSS. THAT MIGHT BE SO, BUT
[1:52:44] YOU GOT TO THINK DIFFERENT than that.
[1:52:45] You got to say, "FATHER,
[1:52:48] I KNOW ONE THING. YOU'RE TRUE.
[1:52:51] &gt;&gt; YOU'RE REALITY. FATHER, I KNOW ONE THING
[1:52:55] MORE. I'M HERE BECAUSE I HAVE A CERTAIN
[1:52:58] NEED. I'M HERE BECAUSE I'M HUNGRY." AND
[1:53:01] THEN GOD WILL COME to that.
[1:53:03] Or you CAN GO ON THE WAY THAT YOU ARE
[1:53:06] &gt;&gt; AND IT'LL GO ON FOR A LONG TIME AND
[1:53:08] PROBABLY DRIBBLE OUT AND NOT NOT be too
[1:53:10] effective. But you can just decide this
[1:53:13] going to be different for me.
[1:53:15] &gt;&gt; This is this going to be a different
[1:53:17] service for me. I'm looking down on you.
[1:53:20] This is GOING TO BE A DIFFERENT MEETING.
[1:53:24] &gt;&gt; I'm going to HAVE A DIFFERENT APPROACH.
[1:53:25] AMEN.
[1:53:30] &gt;&gt; This woman standing here, it'll have to
[1:53:32] come from a supernatural resource. He
[1:53:34] said, "And is that right, lady?"
[1:53:37] Well, it depends.
[1:53:40] And you all know what that word, it
[1:53:42] depends
[1:53:44] on what you think it was.
[1:53:48] &gt;&gt; And that would determine whether you get
[1:53:51] what you ask for. Amen.
[1:53:54] &gt;&gt; Now I've come home.
[1:53:56] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:53:57] &gt;&gt; Now I've come to where you live.
[1:54:01] If you haven't asked God for something,
[1:54:04] then
[1:54:06] I'm in question of you.
[1:54:09] I'm in question of you as a believer.
[1:54:11] BUT IF YOU'VE ASKED God for something,
[1:54:13] and as I said Wednesday, we all have
[1:54:16] asked God for things and we haven't seen
[1:54:18] the answer. And we may not because even
[1:54:21] no is an answer. Silence is an answer.
[1:54:27] &gt;&gt; All of those are an answer. BUT THEY
[1:54:28] DON'T CHANGE A BELIEVER'S ATTITUDE.
[1:54:35] &gt;&gt; We all live. We may experience sickness.
[1:54:38] WE MAY EXPERIENCE DEATH. WE MAY
[1:54:40] EXPERIENCE ALL KINDS of things. BUT THIS
[1:54:42] IS THE WAY IF YOU HAVE TO DIE, THIS IS
[1:54:44] THE WAY YOU WANT TO DIE.
[1:54:48] &gt;&gt; You didn't really
[1:54:51] Come on.
[1:54:54] &gt;&gt; It depends on what you think.
[1:54:58] &gt;&gt; NOT WHAT SHE BESIDE you or your mother
[1:55:00] or your father. IT DEPENDS ON WHAT YOU
[1:55:03] THINK IT IS.
[1:55:08] &gt;&gt; I want all the young people looking up
[1:55:10] this way. You make your notes later.
[1:55:15] I want to ask you a question.
[1:55:22] And I want you to ask yourself the
[1:55:23] question, what do you think it is?
[1:55:29] &gt;&gt; What do you think it is?
[1:55:32] &gt;&gt; Well, you had your teams on Friday night
[1:55:36] and you listed all kinds of your
[1:55:37] questions
[1:55:39] and I thought it was excellent and I
[1:55:42] thought the questions were very good.
[1:55:49] I was moved by those question. What's
[1:55:51] the answer? Where's the answers?
[1:55:54] Or do we just have the same questions at
[1:55:57] another time?
[1:56:02] Where where's the answer to those
[1:56:03] questions?
[1:56:05] Is it it just a desk discussion and a
[1:56:07] dialogue?
[1:56:10] I don't know how long brother Bis will
[1:56:12] be here with you, but I'll tell you
[1:56:13] this.
[1:56:15] You have the answer and I'm going to
[1:56:18] prove it to you in a moment. You have
[1:56:19] the answer actually with you.
[1:56:21] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:56:23] &gt;&gt; The answer is in this word. Say, what is
[1:56:26] the word of God? The answer is in we can
[1:56:28] say, well, it's a message and you hear
[1:56:30] message, message, message. We hear
[1:56:32] revelation, revelation, revelation.
[1:56:35] Where is the word? Is it a sound or
[1:56:38] is it a tape playing? I know people that
[1:56:41] woke up a tape playing. I know a family
[1:56:44] of five boys and when they were the age
[1:56:46] of you fellas here, they they woke up
[1:56:48] every morning to a tape playing and I
[1:56:50] heard the prophet's voice and the
[1:56:51] prophet's voice. To my knowledge, not
[1:56:53] one of them are following the message
[1:56:55] today.
[1:56:56] It was a mechanical thing. It's not a
[1:56:59] bunch of mechanics.
[1:57:00] &gt;&gt; It's the person. The person.
[1:57:02] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:57:04] &gt;&gt; Did those fellas HAVE DISAPPOINTMENTS?
[1:57:05] YEAH, THEY had disappointment. Did
[1:57:07] things go backwards? Yeah. Did they HAVE
[1:57:09] SICKNESS? YEAH, THEY DID. Did death
[1:57:11] happen in the family? Yeah, death
[1:57:12] happened in the family. I buried both
[1:57:14] mother and dad.
[1:57:18] They had all of that.
[1:57:21] They went right from dad's funeral over
[1:57:24] to one place and all were having a can
[1:57:27] of beer a piece.
[1:57:30] I'm not against the fact they had a beer
[1:57:32] if that's the best thing that they got.
[1:57:34] That wasn't the sin. The sin was they
[1:57:37] had a chance
[1:57:38] &gt;&gt; to get acquainted
[1:57:40] &gt;&gt; with a person. Amen.
[1:57:42] &gt;&gt; And they missed that.
[1:57:45] &gt;&gt; They missed that.
[1:57:46] &gt;&gt; IF YOU MISS THAT, OF COURSE, YOU'RE
[1:57:48] GOING TO GO to other things. Of course,
[1:57:50] I
[1:57:51] God help me.
[1:57:53] &gt;&gt; THAT'S JUST THE WORLD. THAT'S THE WAY
[1:57:55] THAT IT IS.
[1:57:56] &gt;&gt; I GOOD FRIENDS. I HAVE GOOD FRIENDS I
[1:57:58] SAT WITH. WE LIVED IN THE SAME ROOM AND
[1:58:00] AND ONE went to the world and and and I
[1:58:04] tried, BUT IT DIDN'T FIT.
[1:58:07] &gt;&gt; THE WORLD WASN'T MY THING.
[1:58:09] AND I WOULD READ THE LIFE story of
[1:58:12] BROTHER BEN BRANAMAN BULL LIKE A BABY
[1:58:14] CUZ THERE WAS SOMETHING THERE.
[1:58:17] &gt;&gt; AND I SAID I WANT THAT.
[1:58:19] &gt;&gt; WHEN I SEE SISTER L HERE ALL THESE YEARS
[1:58:21] LATER 50 60 YEARS LATER SEE A WOMAN
[1:58:24] STANDING ON THE PLATFORM THAT'S WHY WHEN
[1:58:26] YOU SEE THE VIDEO THAT'S WHY I HAVE HER
[1:58:29] THERE BECAUSE I'M standing there and my
[1:58:33] daughter Linda came up and gave her a
[1:58:35] bouquet. I said, the prophet said, give
[1:58:37] him a a bouquet better now, a rose now,
[1:58:41] than a whole bouquet later. I just want
[1:58:44] to honor her AND RESPECT HER. GOD
[1:58:46] RESPECTED HER. WHY WOULDN'T I RESPECT
[1:58:48] HER?
[1:58:51] [cheering]
[1:58:51] &gt;&gt; GOD GAVE SOMETHING TO THE PERSON. WHY
[1:58:54] WOULDN'T I WANT IT?
[1:58:56] &gt;&gt; Don't sit back and say, "Well, you know,
[1:58:59] he's lucky or she's lucky or they had AN
[1:59:01] EASY LIFE." NONSENSE. THEY MAY HAVE HAD
[1:59:04] THE HARDEST LIFE IN THE WORLD.
[1:59:07] &gt;&gt; Come on. Come on.
[1:59:12] &gt;&gt; But one thing
[1:59:14] you fellas, maybe you think I'm a
[1:59:17] but I walk through the woods and I look
[1:59:20] at a flower,
[1:59:22] little wild flower out there and I just
[1:59:25] look at that beauty.
[1:59:27] I just weep.
[1:59:30] So wonderful.
[1:59:32] So wonderful.
[1:59:37] I didn't have a prophet that told me God
[1:59:39] was in creation,
[1:59:41] but I was communicating with that God.
[1:59:44] &gt;&gt; That God's in the flower in your yard.
[1:59:48] &gt;&gt; We need to take time and SAY, "OH,
[1:59:51] FATHER, HERE I AM."
[1:59:57] &gt;&gt; AND I BRING HIM DOWN TO YOU, FRIENDS. I
[1:59:58] WANT TO BRING IT to you. AMEN.
[2:00:01] &gt;&gt; THIS IS PART OF THIS PIERCING, DIVIDING
[2:00:03] A SUNDER.
[2:00:04] &gt;&gt; HE SEPARATED YOU. THAT'S WHY YOU'RE
[2:00:06] HERE. JUST THINK OF IT. YOU COULD HAVE
[2:00:08] BEEN ANYWHERE ELSE, BUT YOU'RE HERE
[2:00:11] &gt;&gt; BECAUSE THAT SWORD OF THE WORD HAS
[2:00:13] SEPARATED YOU
[2:00:14] &gt;&gt; FROM THE WORLD. AND AND HE'S HERE TRYING
[2:00:16] TO SAY, YOU'RE NOT OF THEM. YOU'RE MINE.
[2:00:25] &gt;&gt; I'm just going to take a couple more
[2:00:26] minutes.
[2:00:30] In another serves, we would see Jesus.
[2:00:34] So the word doesn't contradict himself.
[2:00:36] God's word always runs perfectly smooth
[2:00:39] through the Bible.
[2:00:41] Now this statement then
[2:00:44] this one little woman had done all she
[2:00:45] could. The doctors had done all they
[2:00:48] could.
[2:00:53] And they were honest and couldn't help
[2:00:54] the woman.
[2:00:56] She had an issue of blood
[2:00:59] and she was thin and frail
[2:01:02] and she'd heard of him and she believed
[2:01:06] he was a holy man of God.
[2:01:10] Now there it is. It's her approach. Now
[2:01:14] listen. He says, "Are you ready?"
[2:01:16] And I say this congregation, I want to
[2:01:19] echo his words. Are you ready?
[2:01:22] &gt;&gt; Are you ready? It's your approach.
[2:01:25] It depends on what you think about it.
[2:01:29] &gt;&gt; I don't want this service just to end.
[2:01:32] I want you to be asking yourself, what
[2:01:34] do I think about this?
[2:01:37] Why am I here? Am I here because my
[2:01:40] friends are here or because other
[2:01:42] couples are here? Or why are we here? I
[2:01:46] want you to be here because you are
[2:01:48] desperately in love
[2:01:50] &gt;&gt; with this person called Jesus Christ.
[2:01:53] who's revealed himself. He has revealed
[2:01:56] himself, the person of Jesus Christ. Not
[2:01:59] just to gather here in a service, but
[2:02:02] when you go home and when you're about
[2:02:05] your work
[2:02:08] or wherever you are,
[2:02:11] &gt;&gt; he can be just as real at that time.
[2:02:14] That's right.
[2:02:16] &gt;&gt; It says when he comes into a meeting to
[2:02:18] vindicate himself,
[2:02:20] touch him once and find out if he's the
[2:02:24] high priest that can be touched with the
[2:02:27] feeling of our infirmities. I'm going to
[2:02:29] end
[2:02:32] with this in a moment.
[2:02:36] This quiet service and I want you
[2:02:39] thinking real deep.
[2:02:42] If you never hear me again, you hear
[2:02:45] this. You can touch him.
[2:02:50] &gt;&gt; You have the ability,
[2:02:53] inner ability to touch him.
[2:02:55] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:02:56] &gt;&gt; How do you touch him? Say, "Okay,
[2:02:58] brother Biscll, how do I touch him?" He
[2:03:02] just finished telling you, "It depends
[2:03:04] what you think about it. you your mind
[2:03:09] and your whole being and your approach
[2:03:13] it's what you think about him and that
[2:03:15] will that will touch him
[2:03:19] about two things I want to go to how do
[2:03:22] we touch him
[2:03:24] and depending on what what does it
[2:03:26] depend on
[2:03:28] he said it's a very beautiful picture
[2:03:29] today of people who have never seen God
[2:03:33] and maybe have never seen a move of God,
[2:03:36] but yet with reverence to his word move
[2:03:39] up into the realm.
[2:03:45] &gt;&gt; You've said, "Well, you were in the
[2:03:47] prophet's meetings. I've never seen
[2:03:48] that." Brother Brandham is speaking to
[2:03:51] you. So, you never been in a meeting.
[2:03:53] You've never been there. And he says,
[2:03:56] "Furthermore,
[2:03:57] maybe you've never seen a move of God.
[2:04:00] Maybe you've never seen anything of a
[2:04:02] supernatural nature. Are you listening?"
[2:04:06] But yet
[2:04:08] with reverence,
[2:04:10] &gt;&gt; go home and look it up. But yet with
[2:04:13] reverence to his word, move up
[2:04:17] &gt;&gt; into the realm.
[2:04:20] &gt;&gt; WHAT REALM?
[2:04:22] WHAT REALM IS THIS? IT'S A REALM WHERE I
[2:04:24] ACTUALLY CAN RECEIVE AND obtain the
[2:04:27] thing I'M CRAVING.
[2:04:30] &gt;&gt; The realities of God.
[2:04:33] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:04:38] says there are people sitting here
[2:04:41] perhaps that's dying with cancer with
[2:04:44] heart trouble that's never seen a
[2:04:46] healing service where they prayed for
[2:04:48] the sick
[2:04:51] maybe come out of churches and their
[2:04:53] theology condemns it but yet something
[2:04:57] within them is moving them out to take a
[2:05:00] stand tonight for divine healing yet has
[2:05:04] never seen a miracle performed. But it's
[2:05:07] but there's something and brother
[2:05:08] Brandham keeps using the word there's
[2:05:10] something and that's why Wednesday I
[2:05:12] said I'm having trouble identifying or
[2:05:14] or or being specific with it but I know
[2:05:17] that the word of God that has come to
[2:05:20] us. We have 1100 and some tapes. I'm
[2:05:23] stirred because many people call
[2:05:25] themselves MESSAGE BELIEVERS HAVE NO
[2:05:28] CLUE OF THE PERSON who is being revealed
[2:05:32] with those words.
[2:05:33] &gt;&gt; IT'S JUST A IT'S NOT A SERIES OF ENGLISH
[2:05:35] WORDS. IT'S NOT A SERIES OF FRENCH
[2:05:37] WORDS, German words,
[2:05:40] &gt;&gt; Russian words, ANY OTHER kind of words.
[2:05:44] IT'S NOT IT'S NOT IDENTIFIED THAT WAY.
[2:05:47] But whatever language you speak, that
[2:05:50] person who I'm talking about today who
[2:05:54] has HE HAS PENETRATED, HE'S PIERCED
[2:05:57] THROUGH THIS GENERATION.
[2:06:00] &gt;&gt; HE'S COME INTO THIS GODLESS, SINLESS,
[2:06:02] PERVERTED AGE.
[2:06:06] &gt;&gt; He has arrived
[2:06:08] &gt;&gt; AND HE IS SUBSTANTIAL.
[2:06:11] &gt;&gt; I DON'T CARE WHAT YOU FACE. HE'S MORE
[2:06:13] THAN ADEQUATE.
[2:06:16] THE POINT OF THIS sword of THE WORD, IT
[2:06:19] FELL INTO THE PROPHET'S HANDS, BUT THAT
[2:06:21] SWORD OF THE WORD IS IN YOUR HAND.
[2:06:25] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[2:06:28] &gt;&gt; YOU KNOW WHY YOU'RE HERE? Do you know
[2:06:29] why you're here? THAT IT MIGHT BE
[2:06:31] FULFILLED WHICH WAS SPOKEN OF BY THE
[2:06:34] PROPHET MALACHI.
[2:06:36] &gt;&gt; That's why you're here.
[2:06:38] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:06:39] &gt;&gt; God honors his word. He's spoken THROUGH
[2:06:42] THE PROPHET MALACHI. HE'S SPOKEN THROUGH
[2:06:44] other He SPOKE THROUGH JESUS CHRIST lips
[2:06:46] himself.
[2:06:50] &gt;&gt; All that the father hath given me.
[2:06:53] &gt;&gt; WELCOME.
[2:06:55] &gt;&gt; ARE you here?
[2:06:57] &gt;&gt; ARE YOU A GIFT OF THE FATHER
[2:07:00] &gt;&gt; TO JESUS CHRIST?
[2:07:02] &gt;&gt; All that the father hath given me
[2:07:04] &gt;&gt; will come
[2:07:06] &gt;&gt; and I will lose none of them.
[2:07:09] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:07:10] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:07:11] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:07:15] Brother Bren says, "Five or six years
[2:07:17] ago, I was called to a hospital where a
[2:07:20] boy had black dtheria and was dying and
[2:07:24] the doctor wouldn't let me go in
[2:07:27] on a on a kind of on account of my boy
[2:07:30] and my little girl."
[2:07:33] And he said, "The boy's dying and
[2:07:35] there's nothing you can do for him."
[2:07:38] And the old father and mother stood
[2:07:39] there and said, "We want him to go in
[2:07:41] anyhow."
[2:07:42] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:07:43] &gt;&gt; The parents of the boy said, "We want,
[2:07:47] brother, we want him to go in anyhow."
[2:07:49] And the mother bowed on one side and the
[2:07:52] father on the other side and the little
[2:07:56] nurse stood at the end.
[2:07:59] He says, "I I never done a thing but
[2:08:01] just asked God, let the boy live." Amen.
[2:08:06] &gt;&gt; He said he was about 15 years old.
[2:08:09] Laid hands over on him and said, "God,
[2:08:12] this is your word and I believe you."
[2:08:15] &gt;&gt; And I lay my hands upon him in
[2:08:17] commemoration of what you said.
[2:08:19] &gt;&gt; And got up and said, "Amen."
[2:08:22] &gt;&gt; And the father run around. We're talking
[2:08:24] about approach.
[2:08:27] &gt;&gt; We're talking about what you depend.
[2:08:29] Well, it depends ON WHAT YOU THINK IT
[2:08:31] IS.
[2:08:32] &gt;&gt; THIS IS JUST A MAN. And he's maybe just
[2:08:34] a farmer. His 15year-old boy there's
[2:08:36] DYING OF DTHERIA, BLACK DTHERIA. THE
[2:08:39] DOCTOR SAID YOU CAN'T GO IN. You didn't
[2:08:42] hear you heard the words of brother
[2:08:43] Brandham. Nothing spectacular about the
[2:08:47] prayer.
[2:08:48] &gt;&gt; And it really wasn't only in the prayer.
[2:08:50] It was that the what what the FATHER AND
[2:08:52] MOTHER THOUGHT ABOUT THE PRAYER.
[2:08:56] That's right.
[2:08:58] &gt;&gt; AND HE RAN AROUND the side and grabbed
[2:09:02] mother and kissed her and said, "Mother,
[2:09:05] isn't this wonderful?"
[2:09:07] &gt;&gt; The boy laying there dying, he said,
[2:09:09] "Mother, oh, it's so wonderful, honey,
[2:09:12] to think that the Lord has healed our
[2:09:15] boy."
[2:09:20] &gt;&gt; THAT'S WHAT THEY THOUGHT IT WAS.
[2:09:23] &gt;&gt; AM I GETTING IT ACROSS? THAT'S WHAT THEY
[2:09:25] THOUGHT IT WAS. AND IT DEPENDED ON WHAT
[2:09:28] THEY THOUGHT IT WAS.
[2:09:31] AND HE SAID CLEARLY, IF YOU THINK IT'S
[2:09:33] FROM GOD, YOUR REWARD WILL COME FROM
[2:09:36] GOD. IF YOU THINK IT'S JUST A FAKE OR
[2:09:38] THINK THAT JUST SOME PRAYER, THAT'S ALL
[2:09:40] YOU'LL GET. NOTHING.
[2:09:44] &gt;&gt; I'M TRYING TO ANSWER YOUR QUESTION.
[2:09:47] &gt;&gt; WHY DON'T WE GET ANYTHING? BECAUSE IT
[2:09:49] DEPENDS WHAT YOU THINK ABOUT IT.
[2:09:53] HALLELUJAH.
[2:09:57] [snorts]
[2:09:58] &gt;&gt; And the little nurse said, "I believe,
[2:10:00] sir," when she saw him kiss his wife and
[2:10:05] said, "I believe, sir,
[2:10:08] you misunderstood what the doctor said."
[2:10:11] [snorts]
[2:10:12] Said, "Now, it's good to have faith, but
[2:10:14] how can he act like that and be so happy
[2:10:17] when your boy will be a a corpse in the
[2:10:20] next couple hours?
[2:10:22] That old saint wiped the tears from his
[2:10:25] eyes, put his hands over on the little
[2:10:27] nurse's shoulder, and said, "My dear
[2:10:29] loving child,"
[2:10:31] said, "You're looking at the electric
[2:10:33] cardiogram
[2:10:34] because that's all you know to look at,
[2:10:37] &gt;&gt; but I'm looking to a divine promise
[2:10:40] &gt;&gt; that was made by God,
[2:10:43] &gt;&gt; and my boy lives."
[2:10:46] &gt;&gt; He said he's married and has a couple
[2:10:48] children now.
[2:10:54] I want to close. Just give me a couple
[2:10:55] more minutes, please.
[2:10:57] &gt;&gt; I want to close.
[2:11:00] We say it's the law.
[2:11:04] You can't You can't take that. It's the
[2:11:06] law.
[2:11:08] You can't drive that speed. It's the
[2:11:10] law.
[2:11:12] And then everpresent waters from the
[2:11:14] rock.
[2:11:17] He said when we die our souls will go
[2:11:19] under the altar of God where I was
[2:11:22] privileged to say a few mornings ago.
[2:11:24] This was 61.
[2:11:27] [snorts]
[2:11:31] I was probably with him
[2:11:36] the next month.
[2:11:39] It was June 61.
[2:11:41] I was with him either August or
[2:11:43] September.
[2:11:45] And I'm sorry. Yeah. again
[2:11:48] and our bodies shall return to the dust
[2:11:50] of the earth. But some someday
[2:11:53] &gt;&gt; where the scripture is fulfilled
[2:11:56] &gt;&gt; our spirits will be released from God
[2:11:59] will pick up the soul and the soul to
[2:12:01] the body and the power that'll raise us
[2:12:04] up is right in us. Now if you believe
[2:12:08] that when a person dies their body will
[2:12:10] go to dust. We believe that. But he same
[2:12:13] prophet said and that same power he said
[2:12:16] we and that power that'll raise us up is
[2:12:19] right in us now and we are now in
[2:12:22] heavenly places and we are now in the
[2:12:25] power of the resurrection. If there
[2:12:27] wasn't a law to that sons and daughters
[2:12:31] would create them a world out there out
[2:12:34] here and go and live a private life on
[2:12:36] it. You have the power in you to do it.
[2:12:40] If you've got a shadow of the power of
[2:12:42] God in you, you got the power to do it.
[2:12:46] God is omnipotent.
[2:12:48] &gt;&gt; See, he said, "What I mean, the power
[2:12:50] that's in you will make you could make a
[2:12:52] world into existence and go and live on
[2:12:55] it." And he says, "There you are." That
[2:12:58] power now that there's so much more in
[2:13:00] us than we realize.
[2:13:04] I can look at the body and say, "Well,
[2:13:06] you're getting weak. You're getting
[2:13:08] you're getting old. You're doing this or
[2:13:09] doing that."
[2:13:12] &gt;&gt; What he said, I believe that.
[2:13:19] &gt;&gt; He said, "That's what power is in the
[2:13:21] church." Now, you have to stay with me
[2:13:23] now. Very close.
[2:13:25] But it's controlled by a law.
[2:13:28] &gt;&gt; The power's there, but it's controlled
[2:13:30] by a law.
[2:13:33] And that law is not keeping a bunch of
[2:13:36] commandments.
[2:13:38] &gt;&gt; That law is not saying your dress has to
[2:13:40] be so long and your hair has to be long
[2:13:42] and you have to be like like clean young
[2:13:44] men, young ladies and families. That's
[2:13:46] not what the law is. It's not doesn't
[2:13:49] happen like that. Those things we do
[2:13:51] because we love him.
[2:13:52] &gt;&gt; Those things we do is because that's
[2:13:54] what the word says.
[2:13:56] &gt;&gt; But the law, he said, it's a law of
[2:13:58] faith. And Jesus said, "Now listen," he
[2:14:02] was up to the he was talking to the
[2:14:04] people. He said, "Now I have a knife.
[2:14:07] It's in my pocket.
[2:14:10] At least I think it's in my pocket."
[2:14:13] He said, "If it's not there, it's on the
[2:14:16] dresser at home."
[2:14:19] But he says, "Faith will take that knife
[2:14:22] and put it in my pocket." He said, "You
[2:14:25] may NOT UNDERSTAND THAT SCIENTIFICALLY
[2:14:27] IT'S IMPOSSIBLE, BUT ALL THINGS ARE
[2:14:30] POSSIBLE TO them that believe."
[2:14:33] &gt;&gt; WE HAVE TO UNDERSTAND THE LAW OF FAITH.
[2:14:37] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[2:14:37] &gt;&gt; AND APPROACH IS PART OF it and how how
[2:14:41] we approach it and WHAT WE THINK IT IS.
[2:14:45] &gt;&gt; NOW, some of you going to leave here and
[2:14:47] perhaps not get that, but that's WHAT IT
[2:14:49] IS.
[2:14:50] &gt;&gt; ALL THINGS are possible. Amen.
[2:14:58] &gt;&gt; How many heard the testimony of the two
[2:15:02] $50 bills in my pocket in Mexico?
[2:15:12] I was suffering terribly with my back.
[2:15:14] I'm going to be as quick as possible
[2:15:15] because I just want to end with two
[2:15:16] quotes. I was suffering terribly. This
[2:15:18] is only about three, four years ago.
[2:15:21] and uh
[2:15:23] and we we said we we went we hadn't gone
[2:15:26] to this place and I I really I'm not one
[2:15:31] to go to Mexico much. So anyway, we
[2:15:34] ended up down there. We're in a hotel
[2:15:38] and I laid for one week.
[2:15:41] I just laid for one week out on a a
[2:15:44] upper patio
[2:15:47] and tried to give chance for my back to
[2:15:50] heal.
[2:15:54] And I felt bad. My wife is sitting
[2:15:56] there, sitting there, sitting there.
[2:15:58] She's perfectly fine, but I'm lamed up.
[2:16:01] And so I felt I should take her maybe
[2:16:04] just down and see if she want to buy
[2:16:05] some things to take home before we go
[2:16:09] some to the kids.
[2:16:12] So I said, "Well, let's let's just go
[2:16:14] out." And I said, "I don't know how far
[2:16:17] I can walk, but we'll walk down the
[2:16:18] street."
[2:16:21] And I had taken four $450 US $50 bills,
[2:16:24] and they were brand new. They were
[2:16:25] crisp, real crisp. And I folded them up.
[2:16:28] I took two of them, $100, and I put them
[2:16:32] in my pocket. And I had some pesos and
[2:16:36] uh a few dollars. I don't know what, but
[2:16:38] I had those 250s and I thought in case
[2:16:40] she sees something. So, I went shopping
[2:16:43] and and I couldn't go very far. And I
[2:16:45] said, "Well, I I can't walk back, so
[2:16:47] let's take a taxi back." We took a taxi
[2:16:50] and I pulled into the hotel and I got a
[2:16:53] little bit nervous because, you know, I
[2:16:55] didn't want the taxi waiting and I'm and
[2:16:57] I'm floundering around my pants to get
[2:17:00] the money to pay those to pay him. And
[2:17:03] so I paid him the money and went
[2:17:06] upstairs
[2:17:08] and we were up just for a little while
[2:17:10] and felt, well, we better go down have a
[2:17:13] bite to eat.
[2:17:16] So I I reached into my pocket
[2:17:20] and those 50 two $50 bills aren't there.
[2:17:26] And so I started going around the seams
[2:17:29] of my pocket
[2:17:31] and I went into this pocket and I went
[2:17:33] into my back pockets and I went to
[2:17:36] everything and I began to think I'm not
[2:17:40] losing my mind. So I went to the little
[2:17:43] safe. I'm going to tell you this in
[2:17:45] detail. Went to the little safe, opened
[2:17:47] it up and took the $50 bills that were
[2:17:50] folded up. No, there's just two left.
[2:17:53] Now, I know I I clearly put it in my
[2:17:55] pocket in case my wife wanted to buy
[2:17:57] something.
[2:17:59] And I've I've done that all my life, and
[2:18:02] I always have some loose money in my
[2:18:04] pocket.
[2:18:06] And I started feeling real discouraged.
[2:18:08] I thought maybe I had different pair of
[2:18:10] pants on. So, I went to the I went to
[2:18:13] the closet and I thought maybe I had
[2:18:15] these pants on. So, I put my hand all in
[2:18:18] them. Nothing's there. No, I didn't have
[2:18:21] those on. No, I know I had these pants
[2:18:23] on and I go into I can't believe it. I
[2:18:26] just can't believe it. So I said to my
[2:18:29] wife, I've lost the $250 bill. So I've
[2:18:31] lost $100.
[2:18:33] Well, she said, "How did that happen?" I
[2:18:35] said, "Well, I don't know. I'm going to
[2:18:37] go down and go to the lost and found." I
[2:18:39] said, "Maybe when I was paying the taxi,
[2:18:42] maybe I maybe they're happy. Maybe the
[2:18:45] taxi driver is happy he's got a 100 US.
[2:18:48] Maybe it fell on the floor because I was
[2:18:51] in a hurry and trying to pay him.
[2:18:54] So I went downstairs and I went to the
[2:18:56] bail men. There was three of them. I
[2:18:58] said, "I lost $100, 250s.
[2:19:02] Do you have Have you seen it?" "No, they
[2:19:05] talked." "No, we haven't seen anything."
[2:19:08] And they were very nice. They said, "You
[2:19:10] should go to the lost and found." So I
[2:19:12] went to the front desk. "Have you found
[2:19:14] has any money been turned in?" Not that
[2:19:17] I thought it would get turned in. I just
[2:19:19] my heart I just thought it's gone.
[2:19:20] That's all. It's just gone.
[2:19:24] And I said, "Well, let's go and have a
[2:19:26] bite to eat." So, we went and had a bite
[2:19:28] to eat. And it was a downer. Not because
[2:19:30] it was $100 because h how how I lost it.
[2:19:33] I couldn't understand how I lost that.
[2:19:36] And I was just downer cuz I lost it. And
[2:19:40] we went up and went up to and went
[2:19:42] upstairs and I went to bed.
[2:19:45] And the morning when I woke up,
[2:19:49] uh, my wife wasn't in bed.
[2:19:53] So, well, so I I got up and I I took
[2:19:58] those pants that I had on and put them
[2:20:00] on. And I had just doing them up my
[2:20:03] pants.
[2:20:06] says, "All right."
[2:20:08] &gt;&gt; It just how simple. And my wife just
[2:20:12] walked out of the bathroom.
[2:20:15] And I and I had these jeans on. I just
[2:20:17] went like that and just I got my fingers
[2:20:19] just right here on the top and I felt
[2:20:22] some paper
[2:20:24] and I took a hold of it and it was a two
[2:20:27] $50 bills.
[2:20:29] I said, "Here's the two $50 bills."
[2:20:33] and she said, "I was listening to a
[2:20:36] message
[2:20:38] and Brother Ben talked about Brother
[2:20:40] Fred Sothman lost the keys to his car."
[2:20:43] So he said, "Well, let's pray."
[2:20:46] And other man, his his pickup was
[2:20:49] stolen.
[2:20:51] And the thing that stuck in my wife's
[2:20:53] mind was, "Let's pray." And the pickup
[2:20:56] was stolen. And Brother Brandham said,
[2:20:57] "Well, let's pray." So he says, "We got
[2:21:00] down and prayed." And so she said,
[2:21:04] I just went in the bathroom so I
[2:21:07] wouldn't trouble you and I just prayed
[2:21:11] that God would bring that $50 bills back
[2:21:14] and they're right at the top of my
[2:21:16] pocket and that's before God and I
[2:21:19] pulled them out and was showing them to
[2:21:21] her exactly the way they were. Now
[2:21:24] friends,
[2:21:26] that's not God of yesterday.
[2:21:28] &gt;&gt; That's not God of 100 years ago. That's
[2:21:31] God. And the prophet of God said, "If
[2:21:33] you could pray and believe it,
[2:21:36] &gt;&gt; and somehow she found favor with God and
[2:21:38] believed it and it ended up at the top
[2:21:40] of my pocket."
[2:21:42] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:21:43] &gt;&gt; And I either saved them or spent them. I
[2:21:45] don't know which.
[2:21:49] &gt;&gt; Do you believe that?
[2:21:51] &gt;&gt; Okay. I want to end with this.
[2:21:54] And brother John, you won't have to cut
[2:21:55] back tonight
[2:21:57] because
[2:21:59] in in expectation
[2:22:04] [snorts]
[2:22:10] and I'll just use this one
[2:22:13] now. Please, you young people just
[2:22:15] listen real close. You can understand
[2:22:16] this real good. And then I'm going to
[2:22:19] close.
[2:22:21] He said electricity
[2:22:24] will light up
[2:22:27] if
[2:22:29] if
[2:22:31] you work according to the law of
[2:22:33] electricity.
[2:22:36] He said you could have an artisian well
[2:22:38] on this time of on the side of the hill
[2:22:41] and thousands of gallons of water per
[2:22:43] minute to pour on this side of the hill.
[2:22:47] He said, "You could go and water the
[2:22:48] crop, it'll never do it. But if you work
[2:22:51] according to the way of gravitation
[2:22:54] and run that that water over on the
[2:22:58] hill, it'll water the crop. But you've
[2:23:01] got to work according to the law of
[2:23:04] gravitation." That's now we talk about
[2:23:06] the law of faith. Now we talk about the
[2:23:08] law of gravitation.
[2:23:10] Well, now he said, "If God is here,
[2:23:14] all in this building, if God is here,
[2:23:18] I'm saying if God is here."
[2:23:20] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:23:21] &gt;&gt; I'm not talking about back there. I'm
[2:23:22] reading a quote. But if God is here,
[2:23:25] &gt;&gt; here
[2:23:30] in this building right now.
[2:23:35] And he said, "Do you believe that?"
[2:23:36] Amen.
[2:23:38] &gt;&gt; He said, "We're all conscious."
[2:23:42] He said, "We're all conscious that God
[2:23:44] is here. Now, the only thing that we can
[2:23:46] do, the only thing that we can do is to
[2:23:50] work according to the law of God for our
[2:23:54] healing." Now, he's talking about
[2:23:56] healing. What is the law? He said, for
[2:23:58] instance,
[2:24:00] and he talked about, he said, "We're on
[2:24:02] some dark mountain someplace here." And
[2:24:05] he says, "You know that electricity is
[2:24:07] all around you." And when I was reading
[2:24:09] this, when I underlined it, I was
[2:24:11] saying, "God is all around me.
[2:24:13] &gt;&gt; God is here."
[2:24:15] &gt;&gt; Don't weary, friends. I'm just going to
[2:24:17] end right away. He said, "You could
[2:24:19] scream till you got horse."
[2:24:22] &gt;&gt; And when I read that,
[2:24:24] &gt;&gt; I said, "I've seen some of our young
[2:24:26] people screaming till they got horse."
[2:24:28] Yes.
[2:24:32] &gt;&gt; He said, "You could scream till you got
[2:24:34] horse and you CAN SAY, "OH, ELECTRICITY,
[2:24:35] ELECTRICITY." AND I'VE HEARD HIM SAY,
[2:24:37] "OH, GOD. OH, GOD.
[2:24:41] LIGHT UP AND SHOW ME HOW TO GET OUT of
[2:24:44] here. I KNOW YOU'RE HERE. I KNOW YOU'RE
[2:24:48] HERE. ELECTRICITY. IT'S SCIENTIFICALLY
[2:24:50] PROVEN that you're here. I KNOW YOU'RE
[2:24:53] HERE. SO, YOU LIGHT UP. YOU SHOULD
[2:24:56] SCREAM." HE SAID, "YOU COULD scream till
[2:24:57] you got horse and it would never light
[2:25:00] up.
[2:25:02] You could scream for God and you could
[2:25:04] never sense him and never feel HIM AND
[2:25:06] NEVER GET YOUR ANSWER because God
[2:25:09] operates BY CERTAIN LAWS." YOU HAVE TO
[2:25:12] BELIEVE that law God is here.
[2:25:14] &gt;&gt; You have to believe and you have to
[2:25:16] depend on the divine gift that God
[2:25:18] sends. YOU GOT TO SAY, "GOD, I BELIEVE
[2:25:21] THAT IS YOUR PROPHET MESSENGER."
[2:25:23] &gt;&gt; AMEN. I believe in the ministry he has
[2:25:25] sent.
[2:25:27] &gt;&gt; I believe that when THE MAN OF GOD
[2:25:28] STANDS BEHIND THIS PULPIT, I'M GOING TO
[2:25:31] HEAR FROM GOD.
[2:25:33] &gt;&gt; IT DEPENDS ON WHAT YOU THINK.
[2:25:35] &gt;&gt; AND IF YOU THINK IT'S GOD, YOU'LL GET
[2:25:37] SOMETHING FROM GOD. IF YOU THINK IT'S
[2:25:39] JUST a a human up there SCREAMING AND
[2:25:42] YELLING, THEN THAT'S ALL YOU'LL GET. YOU
[2:25:45] CAN'T GET ANYTHING FROM THE HUMAN. I
[2:25:47] CAN'T DO ANYTHING FOR YOU.
[2:25:48] &gt;&gt; BUT IF I CAN GET YOU TO AGREE, I'M GOING
[2:25:51] TO DEPEND ON THAT. AND I BELIEVE THAT'S
[2:25:53] FROM GOD. I BELIEVE THIS WORD IS FROM
[2:25:55] GOD. THEN you the words of your prayer
[2:25:58] will be answered.
[2:26:01] &gt;&gt; Am I making sense?
[2:26:06] &gt;&gt; He said, "But you've got to flow the
[2:26:09] laws
[2:26:11] according to the
[2:26:14] electricity."
[2:26:15] And he said, "God said, I'll send signs
[2:26:18] among you." Hello, friends. This is not
[2:26:20] a Sunday morning service. I'm not
[2:26:22] treating it like a Sunday morning
[2:26:24] service. I'm treating it like a last
[2:26:26] message I'd speak to you. You got real
[2:26:29] needs. I got real needs. We've prayed.
[2:26:31] We've asked God. We've cried. We've
[2:26:34] screamed. We've done all of these
[2:26:35] things. But I want I have to announce to
[2:26:38] you there is a law that it works by.
[2:26:41] &gt;&gt; And one of it is your approach. One of
[2:26:43] it is a reverence that you have towards
[2:26:46] it. You know, you you can take your
[2:26:49] choice.
[2:26:52] &gt;&gt; You say, "Well, I don't have much
[2:26:54] respect for that person." You won't get
[2:26:56] anything.
[2:26:57] &gt;&gt; Don't even listen to him then. Just
[2:26:58] forget it.
[2:27:00] &gt;&gt; But if you respect it, it's not the
[2:27:03] person.
[2:27:04] &gt;&gt; It is the gift that God sends. The
[2:27:07] divine gift.
[2:27:08] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:27:09] &gt;&gt; And my my stress
[2:27:13] what God is dealing with me about. I can
[2:27:15] preach this because God is dealing with
[2:27:16] me about it.
[2:27:18] I You say, "Well, what are you what are
[2:27:20] you interested in, Brother Ed? I'm
[2:27:23] interested in the rapture."
[2:27:25] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:27:26] &gt;&gt; I'm interested in a rapture. And this
[2:27:27] same prophet has SAID THERE'LL BE ALL
[2:27:29] KINDS OF PEOPLE. THERE'LL BE PEOPLE
[2:27:31] PREACHING after the rapture's taken
[2:27:34] place. AND THE MORE I SEE AND THE MORE I
[2:27:36] hear, and when he starts talking about
[2:27:38] how few there is, how few there is, I
[2:27:41] SAY, "OH, GOD, LET ME BE ONE OF THOSE
[2:27:43] FEW.
[2:27:47] AND WHEN I SEE THESE THINGS THAT WE
[2:27:49] OUGHT TO BE SEEING,
[2:27:52] you've got things in your own home and
[2:27:53] your own family. You young people, you
[2:27:55] got things. And I'm telling you, brother
[2:27:57] Ed is telling you without any without
[2:27:59] any uh a shame or apology. The answer,
[2:28:03] the electricity IS HERE. I KNOW IT'S
[2:28:05] HERE.
[2:28:06] &gt;&gt; The law, THE THE LAW OF ELECTRICITY
[2:28:08] makes it light go on. AND I HAVE
[2:28:10] ABSOLUTE FAITH if I go and turn the
[2:28:12] switch it goes on or goes off. THERE'S
[2:28:15] NO QUESTION IF GOD who put electricity
[2:28:18] in the air. We can't scream it down. We
[2:28:21] can't yell it down. But we can use the
[2:28:23] law
[2:28:24] &gt;&gt; of electricity and you can receive it.
[2:28:27] THE LAW OF FAITH IS HERE.
[2:28:33] &gt;&gt; I'm going to go a step further. I'M SICK
[2:28:35] AND TIRED OF the devil. I'M SICK AND
[2:28:38] TIRED OF HIM BAMBOOZLING a lot of
[2:28:40] people. I'M SICK AND TIRED OF HEARING
[2:28:43] ALL THE THINGS THAT, YOU KNOW, SATAN
[2:28:45] THIS AND SATAN THAT. WELL, LET'S GET RID
[2:28:47] OF HIM.
[2:28:50] &gt;&gt; AND WE COULD SCREAM AND YELL AND SAY, "I
[2:28:52] KNOW THE POWER'S HERE. I KNOW THE
[2:28:53] POWER'S HERE." YOUR PROPHET SAID, "YOU
[2:28:55] HAVE ENOUGH POWER IN YOU TO CREATE A
[2:28:57] WHOLE WORLD
[2:28:59] &gt;&gt; AND GO OUT AND LIVE ON IT, BUT YOU'D
[2:29:01] HAVE TO DO IT BY A LAW."
[2:29:03] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[2:29:03] &gt;&gt; AND HE SAID, "HOW DO WE EXPECT TO HAVE A
[2:29:05] RAPTURE? WE HAVEN'T GOT ENOUGH FAITH FOR
[2:29:07] HEALING.
[2:29:09] &gt;&gt; AND YET WE DO SEE WONDERFUL HEALINGS.
[2:29:19] [snorts]
[2:29:41] SAID, "You don't see him with your eyes.
[2:29:46] He's in another dimension."
[2:29:49] And I can prove that to you.
[2:29:53] There isn't anybody here. We're all
[2:29:55] wireless
[2:29:57] conscious.
[2:29:59] There's nobody here that'd be foolish
[2:30:01] enough to say, "I don't believe in the
[2:30:03] wireless. I don't believe in voices
[2:30:05] going through here."
[2:30:07] There's a way back
[2:30:10] there's way back
[2:30:12] in 1956
[2:30:17] when I didn't have wireless. But we have
[2:30:19] a prophet connected to the author of
[2:30:23] science himself.
[2:30:26] &gt;&gt; And he says there's bodies going through
[2:30:28] the room. There's colors going through
[2:30:30] the room
[2:30:31] &gt;&gt; right now.
[2:30:33] That's not enough for me to say that to
[2:30:35] you.
[2:30:37] &gt;&gt; The answer to your prayer is going
[2:30:40] through the room.
[2:30:43] &gt;&gt; The answer to your cry is going through
[2:30:47] the room.
[2:30:49] &gt;&gt; I don't care what it is. I don't care
[2:30:51] what it is. I don't care what it brings
[2:30:53] you. I don't care if it's a weight upon
[2:30:55] you. THE ANSWER TO BE FREE FROM THAT
[2:30:58] WEIGHT IS IN THE ROOM. IT'S IN THIS
[2:31:01] ROOM.
[2:31:01] &gt;&gt; AMEN. And if I could get you to believe
[2:31:04] that, say, I'm going to respect that
[2:31:07] with all my soul and all my being. I'm
[2:31:11] going to respect that and honor that.
[2:31:13] You're on your way to get the answer.
[2:31:18] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:31:19] Amen.
[2:31:22] &gt;&gt; I've been very very clear and very plain
[2:31:25] and I hope you
[2:31:27] will forgive me for being as
[2:31:29] straightforward as I have been this
[2:31:30] morning. But I'll ask you to bow your
[2:31:33] heads.
[2:31:35] Oh father
[2:31:38] almighty one.
[2:31:41] Oh you have sent out your voice and that
[2:31:44] mighty voice.
[2:31:47] You've reached us Lord. Some that I'm
[2:31:50] speaking to. You reached them when they
[2:31:52] were very young.
[2:31:54] You begin to speak to them.
[2:31:56] Others, oh God, you have walked with
[2:31:59] them through their troubled days and
[2:32:02] through their good times.
[2:32:04] I pray you'll forgive us sometime, Lord.
[2:32:06] When we are going through our good
[2:32:08] times, we forget
[2:32:10] and we go on our merry little way and we
[2:32:14] don't give you the kind of honor,
[2:32:17] the kind of attention
[2:32:20] that we ought to. But I pray you'll
[2:32:22] forgive us for our our shortcomings.
[2:32:26] And above all things, I ask, oh Lord
[2:32:29] Jesus, stay with us. Walk with this
[2:32:33] people. Walk with them, oh God, in the
[2:32:35] midst of their in the midst of their
[2:32:37] need. I'm praying today, oh God, and
[2:32:39] I've been preaching because when uh when
[2:32:42] a prophet of God stood before a
[2:32:44] congregation of people, he was conscious
[2:32:46] of their needs. He was conscious of
[2:32:47] physical needs and spiritual needs. He
[2:32:50] was conscious of their needs and his
[2:32:52] heart went out to them. Lord, my heart
[2:32:54] goes out to the body of Christ, the
[2:32:56] bride of Jesus Christ, especially those
[2:32:59] that are here with us today. especially
[2:33:02] those that are under the sound of my
[2:33:04] voice. Oh God, I pray that you will come
[2:33:08] in a supernatural way and that we will
[2:33:12] hear the testimonies of what you have
[2:33:15] done and what you are doing amongst the
[2:33:18] people. I pray oh God that such joy will
[2:33:21] come through answered prayer and through
[2:33:24] the needs being uh met in the name of
[2:33:27] Jesus Christ. I ask it for your glory.
[2:33:31] Amen. [music]
[2:33:33] Uh, I want to sing. I'll have you stand
[2:33:35] with me if you would. Uh, whatever it
[2:33:38] takes.
[2:33:39] Whatever it takes to draw nearer to you,
[2:33:42] Lord. Um, [music]
[2:33:44] we can sing the chorus first. [snorts]
[2:33:49] You [music] know this chorus song
[2:33:55] to draw [music] closer
[2:33:58] to you, Lord.
[2:34:00] That's what I'll be willing
[2:34:03] [music and singing]
[2:34:04] to do
[2:34:08] for [singing] whatever
[2:34:10] it takes
[2:34:12] to be more like you. [music]
[2:34:17] That's what I'll be willing [singing]
[2:34:21] [music] to do.
[2:34:25] I'll trade sun
[2:34:27] for rain, [music]
[2:34:30] comfort
[2:34:31] for pain. [singing]
[2:34:34] That's what I'll be willing [music] to
[2:34:38] do.
[2:34:42] or whatever
[2:34:44] it [music] takes
[2:34:46] for my will [singing]
[2:34:48] to break. [music]
[2:34:51] That's what I'll be willing
[2:34:55] to do. [music] Verse one, verse one.
[2:34:57] There's a voice calling me. The voice
[2:35:00] calling me [music]
[2:35:03] from an old ruged [singing]
[2:35:06] tree.
[2:35:08] And it whispers, [music]
[2:35:10] "Draw closer
[2:35:12] to me.
[2:35:16] Leave this world far [singing]
[2:35:18] [music] behind.
[2:35:20] There are new heights to climb [singing]
[2:35:25] in a new place in me. You will find."
[2:35:31] [music] Let's make it a prayer now. Oh,
[2:35:33] whatever
[2:35:35] it takes to draw closer [music] to you,
[2:35:40] [singing] Lord,
[2:35:42] that's what I'll be willing
[2:35:46] to do.
[2:35:49] [music]
[2:35:50] Lord, whatever
[2:35:52] it takes
[2:35:54] to be born like you, [music]
[2:35:59] that's what I'll be willing [singing]
[2:36:03] to do.
[2:36:06] [music]
[2:36:07] I'll take sunshine
[2:36:10] for rain
[2:36:14] for rain.
[2:36:16] That's what [music]
[2:36:18] I'll be [singing] willing to do.
[2:36:24] For whatever
[2:36:26] it takes, [music]
[2:36:29] I will
[2:36:31] bring [music]
[2:36:33] that's what I will.
[2:36:38] [music]
[2:36:38] &gt;&gt; Let's sing the second verse as well.
[2:36:40] Take the dearest faith
[2:36:43] to me. [music]
[2:36:45] That's how we must be
[2:36:52] closer [music]
[2:36:54] to thee
[2:36:57] here and let the disappointments
[2:36:59] [singing]
[2:37:00] come [music]
[2:37:09] like you [music]
[2:37:11] become.
[2:37:13] and everyone. Now, whatever [music]
[2:37:17] it takes to draw closer to you, Lord,
[2:37:23] that's [music] what I'll be willing
[2:37:27] to do.
[2:37:31] &gt;&gt; [music]
[2:37:31] &gt;&gt; Whatever
[2:37:33] it takes
[2:37:35] to be more [singing]
[2:37:37] like you,
[2:37:40] that's what [music]
[2:37:42] I'll be willing [singing]
[2:37:44] to do.
[2:37:48] Take sunshine
[2:37:50] for rain, [music]
[2:37:52] comfort
[2:37:54] for [singing]
[2:37:57] that's what [music]
[2:37:58] I'll be willing to do.
[2:38:04] &gt;&gt; [singing]
[2:38:04] &gt;&gt; And whatever [music]
[2:38:07] it takes
[2:38:09] for my will [singing]
[2:38:10] to break,
[2:38:13] that's [music] what I'll be willing to
[2:38:17] do.
[2:38:22] &gt;&gt; Lord Jesus,
[2:38:24] we're here making this declaration in
[2:38:26] song. [music] Whatever it takes to be
[2:38:30] more like you.
[2:38:32] That's what we're willing to do, Lord.
[2:38:35] There may be someone here
[2:38:39] [music] in a state of deep,
[2:38:42] deep decision making and they need to
[2:38:45] make that a clear decision for you. I
[2:38:50] pray that you will not leave them. Lord,
[2:38:53] I prayed this morning. [music] I prayed
[2:38:56] for the your people praying oh God that
[2:39:00] there be a transforming power
[2:39:02] transforming power what you've already
[2:39:05] invested in your word you can change
[2:39:07] defeat into victory you can change
[2:39:10] bondage into deliverance that is all
[2:39:13] present with us here father I pray
[2:39:16] you'll bring it as a reality to the
[2:39:18] hearts [music] of each individual in
[2:39:21] Jesus name amen I want to say if you're
[2:39:24] here and you feel a need of prayer, I'm
[2:39:27] going to stay here and [music] pray with
[2:39:29] you if you feel that need. And I'd ask
[2:39:32] the rest of the congregation rather than
[2:39:33] shaking hands with one another when you
[2:39:36] [music] are when you're done, just the
[2:39:39] service is over. I've been a couple of
[2:39:41] hours and I don't make an apology for
[2:39:44] that, but we I just want to get this
[2:39:46] really off of my heart. So, God bless
[2:39:48] [music] you. I'd like you to just go
[2:39:50] real quietly and be back this evening.
[2:39:53] Brother John Anders [music] is going to
[2:39:54] preach. God bless you. You're dismissed
[2:39:56] in Jesus name. Let's just sing that
[2:39:59] chorus again.
[2:40:03] [music]
[2:40:12] That's [music] what
[2:40:14] I'll be [singing]
[2:40:17] [music]
[2:40:19] according to
[2:40:22] [singing]
[2:40:25] [music] you.
[2:40:30] That's [music] what
[2:40:32] I'll be
[2:40:40] [music] sunshine
[2:40:42] for.
[2:40:45] [music]
[2:40:50] That's why
[2:40:52] I will [music]
[2:40:58] [music]
[2:40:59] forever
[2:41:05] will [music]
[2:41:11] be
[2:41:14] on [music] you.
[2:41:32] &gt;&gt; [music]
[2:41:45] [music]
[2:41:53] [music]
[2:41:54] &gt;&gt; Go ahead.
[2:42:06] Take away
[2:42:13] [music]
[2:42:24] Christ.
