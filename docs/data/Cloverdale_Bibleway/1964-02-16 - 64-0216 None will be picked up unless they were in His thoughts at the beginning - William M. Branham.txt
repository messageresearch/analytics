Video clip with End Time Message through God's vindicated prophet of Malachi 4:5-6, William Marrion Branham, from 1909 to 1965. It's all about Jesus Christ revealing Himself just before the end time. See Luke 17:30 and Rev 10:7

AMOS 3:7
  7    Surely the Lord GOD will do nothing, but he revealeth his secret unto his servants the prophets.

REVELATION 10:7
  7    But in the days of the voice of the seventh angel, when he shall begin to sound, the mystery of God should be finished, as he hath declared to his servants the prophets.
TRANSCRIPT
========================================
if he is the Redeemer I don't say this to her now it be different I Don't Preach Doctrine but let me ask you something if he is a redeemer he come a redeem is to pick up that which has fallen to redeem back to a place where it was at the beginning yes so none will be picked up but them that was in his thoughts at the beginning amen he come to redeem not this Canon father that we see around professing to be Christian but that he came to redeem that was in God's thinking at the beginning Hallelujah this other is just something makes around to show the statue see it is it's a it's a garden a flower garden it plays its part but the statue is what you want to see the statue of Christ which was God projected to the Earth in the form of a man
