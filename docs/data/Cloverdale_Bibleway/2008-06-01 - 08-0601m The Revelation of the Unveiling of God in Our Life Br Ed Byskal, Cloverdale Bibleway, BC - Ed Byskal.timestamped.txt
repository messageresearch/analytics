[0:34] to
[0:39] the Lord.
[0:40] Let the Lord have his way.
[0:47] Let the Lord
[0:49] have his way in your heart.
[0:54] Every day there's no rest, there's no
[0:59] peace until
[1:03] his way.
[1:05] If your life
[1:07] is
[1:09] resurre
[1:13] [Music]
[1:32] Yes. And there is no peace until
[1:38] his
[1:41] [Music]
[1:43] hand
[1:47] is
[1:49] the
[1:52] Lord.
[1:58] [Music]
[2:00] Amen. trust that each and every one of
[2:02] us this morning and let the Lord have
[2:05] his way
[2:06] &gt;&gt; in our hearts.
[2:08] If he has his way in each of our hearts
[2:10] this morning, then he's going to have
[2:12] his way in the service. Amen.
[2:14] &gt;&gt; It's guaranteed.
[2:15] &gt;&gt; So, we want to submit everything to him.
[2:19] Hebrews 13:15 says, "By him, therefore,
[2:22] let us offer the sacrifice of praise to
[2:25] God continually.
[2:28] That is the fruit of our lips giving
[2:30] thanks to his name. So you might say,
[2:32] well, what is a sacrifice of praise? Say
[2:34] it's the fruit of our lips giving thanks
[2:36] to his name.
[2:38] &gt;&gt; Amen. For with such sacrifices, God is
[2:41] well pleased.
[2:42] &gt;&gt; So if you want to say, I like I want to
[2:44] please God this morning.
[2:46] &gt;&gt; Let's start by using the sacrifice of
[2:49] praise.
[2:50] &gt;&gt; Amen. The fruit of our lips, giving
[2:51] praise to him. And you might say, well,
[2:53] I don't feel like it, you know. I really
[2:55] had a bad week this week, you know, and
[2:57] and and I'm not the kind of person, you
[2:58] know, that really says the sacrifice is
[3:02] the act of giving up something valued.
[3:04] So, you may value your quietness.
[3:07] I'm just a quiet person. That's the way
[3:09] I am. Right? Giving up something valued
[3:12] for the sake of something having a more
[3:14] pressing claim.
[3:16] &gt;&gt; How many know God has a claim on your
[3:18] life?
[3:19] &gt;&gt; Amen. So, we want to give up give up
[3:21] your thoughts. give up your way, you
[3:23] know, your way of thinking. Just let
[3:26] it's be surrendered to God this morning
[3:28] and uh and he'll be pleased with a
[3:31] sacrifice of praise that comes from your
[3:33] lips. Um I'm going to start maybe with
[3:36] uh we'll sing I love you, Lord. And then
[3:39] uh and then I think we're going to have
[3:41] the choir come up, but let's sing this
[3:42] chorus first. Let's just worship him and
[3:45] give him the sacrifice of praise. I love
[3:49] you Lord
[3:53] and I
[3:56] [Music]
[4:00] to worship
[4:03] you.
[4:05] Oh my soul
[4:09] rej.
[4:14] [Music]
[4:17] Yeah.
[4:22] Heat.
[4:32] Heat.
[4:35] Heat.
[4:40] [Music]
[4:45] Heat. Heat. Heat.
[4:56] Rejoice
[5:12] sweet
[5:18] this morning. Say I love you Lord. Oh I
[5:22] love you. Heat. Heat. Heat.
[5:33] Heat. Heat. Heat.
[5:35] [Music]
[5:43] Heat.
[5:45] Heat.
[5:56] [Music]
[6:04] I can't take him
[6:18] to
[6:24] My soul rejoice
[6:33] my king.
[6:52] Amen.
[6:54] Amen.
[6:56] It's a song I've wanted to sing for uh
[6:58] actually look back and it's so it's
[7:00] probably been about five years I wanted
[7:01] to sing this song. So I'm going ask the
[7:03] choir to come up join me. Um
[7:09] and brother Brandham said they finally
[7:10] they hung him on the cross and then God
[7:13] answered from heaven. The sun refused to
[7:16] shine. The moon turned dark. The stars
[7:20] wouldn't show its light. And the son of
[7:22] God died at Calvary. and you look at the
[7:24] sky till a son held had convulsions and
[7:27] went out.
[7:29] They killed him in the city of Jerusalem
[7:31] and buried him in a borrowed tomb. But
[7:33] on Easter morning he come forth. He
[7:35] started climbing. He climbed on beyond
[7:37] the moon and the stars till he sat down
[7:40] at the right hand of the majesty on high
[7:43] and his eye is on the sparrow and I know
[7:45] he watches me.
[7:47] Brother Brandham says, "I was with Moses
[7:49] when he went down into Egypt.
[7:51] I was with Moses at the burning bush. He
[7:53] said if you're a Christian, you're
[7:55] identified with them Bible characters.
[8:00] Yes, sir.
[8:01] &gt;&gt; Said whatever Christians has been,
[8:03] whatever believers has been, every
[8:05] believer now is identified with that
[8:07] same Christian person. Whatever it is,
[8:10] you must be identified. Don't forget
[8:12] that. He said, "And when you do," he
[8:15] said, "If you don't, you've got
[8:16] spiritual am amnesia. You've forgotten
[8:18] who you are." This song kind of uh goes
[8:21] through what it was like for some of the
[8:25] believers
[8:27] at the cross.
[8:29] And uh
[8:32] I'm sure many of us have thought about
[8:33] it, what it was like
[8:40] when he took the Lord.
[8:43] And uh well, I'll just let the song tell
[8:45] the story and maybe you can worship with
[8:47] us as we sing the song.
[8:53] [Music]
[9:18] the Wonder of your cross shall be our
[9:22] meditation.
[9:24] [Music]
[9:31] to gather in that shadow as the sun went
[9:36] down
[9:39] [Music]
[9:43] to weep with those who thought that you
[9:48] were leaving.
[9:51] You were leaving
[9:53] Jesus,
[9:55] the humble king who never wore an
[10:00] earthly crown.
[10:03] [Music]
[10:14] to steal away at night when they took
[10:18] down your body
[10:20] [Music]
[10:26] with love and tears to lay it in a
[10:30] borrowed grave
[10:38] to go with Mary to the place they lead
[10:44] you
[10:45] where they lead you, Jesus.
[10:50] And in the morning, find the stones roll
[10:55] away.

[25:01] [Music]
[25:04] We're going to go to prayer this time.
[25:07] [Music]
[25:14] Got a testimony from Sister Ruth.
[25:18] For the last several weeks, I have
[25:19] suffered from muscle problems, and it
[25:21] was especially severe before and during
[25:23] the meetings in Missouri. On Wednesday
[25:26] night, I could not sit in the service.
[25:27] So, Brother Ed brought me down for
[25:29] prayer. I could only think of what the
[25:31] scripture said, "These signs shall
[25:34] follow them that believe. They shall lay
[25:35] hands on the sick, and they shall
[25:37] recover." On Thursday morning, a
[25:39] wonderful recovery began to take place.
[25:41] I'm thanking Brother Tom and Brother Ed
[25:43] and all the saints who prayed and
[25:45] believed. The promises of the word
[25:47] cannot fail. And all the glory belongs
[25:50] to our Lord Jesus.
[25:52] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[25:53] &gt;&gt; Amen. And maybe you've here this morning
[25:55] and you've got a need.
[26:00] I don't know what it is, but the Lord
[26:02] certainly does. Amen.
[26:05] [Music]
[26:08] Sister Lisa St. John has a request this
[26:11] morning to remember her mom.
[26:14] Sister Jean Watkins in prayer. She has
[26:16] an eye surgery tomorrow. She's just
[26:18] praying that God will help her through a
[26:20] 10-day recovery. She'll have to hold her
[26:22] head bent over, eyes down for 10 days,
[26:25] 24 hours a day. She will need God's help
[26:28] to be able to do this. So, let's pray
[26:30] for our sister Jean. How many have a
[26:33] need this morning? They want to be
[26:35] remembered before the Lord.
[26:37] People out on the internet, people at
[26:39] home listening over the home phone
[26:41] hookup. If you've got a need this
[26:43] morning, you just lift it before the
[26:44] Lord as we go to prayer. Let's just go
[26:46] before him at this time.
[26:48] [Music]
[26:50] Father, we're so thankful,
[26:56] Lord, for everything that you've done
[26:58] for us, Lord.
[27:02] &gt;&gt; Lord, we're not worthy
[27:06] of your grace.
[27:12] But Lord, when we you were on the cross,
[27:15] Lord,
[27:17] we were on your mind, Lord.
[27:19] [Music]
[27:22] And Lord, this morning we serve a ri
[27:24] risen God.
[27:26] And we are so thankful, Lord, that
[27:28] you're here this morning.
[27:32] Lord, your promise says that where two
[27:33] or three are gathered together in your
[27:35] name, Lord, do we have many here
[27:38] together this morning, Lord. Amen.
[27:42] And we're believing this morning,
[27:43] Father, for every need, Lord, that's in
[27:47] your presence here this morning for
[27:50] every person, Lord, listening in on the
[27:51] internet, on the phone, Father. Whatever
[27:54] that need would be, Lord, you know the
[27:56] need. You knew it before we asked. Lord,
[27:59] you knew it before they lifted their
[28:00] hands, oh God. And I pray this morning,
[28:03] oh God, you'd meet that need, Lord
[28:05] Jesus, in every life, oh God. Be with
[28:07] our sister Jean as she's going through
[28:09] this surgery. guide the doctor's hands,
[28:12] oh God, and be with her as she's going
[28:14] through this time of recovery, oh God.
[28:16] Lord Jesus, each and every one of us.
[28:19] Lord, may you, Lord, as our brother Ed
[28:22] comes this morning to speak the word,
[28:24] anoint him, oh God. Lord, speak words of
[28:27] life, Lord Jesus, to every brother,

[28:34] morning, Lord, may you just come, Lord,
[28:37] and have your will, have your way in our
[28:39] midst this morning. Lord, we love you,

[28:45] feet this morning. We're th so thankful
[28:48] that your presence is here with us this
[28:49] morning, Lord Jesus. We're just praying
[28:52] you to have your divine will and way in
[28:54] our midst. And we'll give you all the
[28:56] glory.
[28:58] &gt;&gt; We ask it in Jesus name.
[29:00] Amen. Amen. You can have your seats.

[30:31] but please tell uh let them know if
[30:33] you're going to be there and uh
[30:35] certainly there's been a lot of work
[30:36] going on in the camp and uh we're
[30:38] thankful to see everything that's
[30:40] happening there
[30:43] I know the master of the wind and then
[30:45] we're going to be turning to the word
[30:50] I know the master
[30:56] [Music]
[30:58] I know
[31:04] where he can come.
[31:07] Make the sun shine.
[31:12] I know the master of the we
[31:17] [Music]
[31:19] saints. Heat. Heat. Heat.
[31:34] [Music]
[31:41] I know the master of the wind.
[31:50] &gt;&gt; Aren't you glad you know him?
[31:52] &gt;&gt; Whom to know is life eternal.
[31:55] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[31:57] We're gathered here today for more than
[32:00] just a
[32:02] Sunday morning service, but we're
[32:04] gathered here because we're pilgrims and
[32:06] strangers, and we're actually on our way
[32:10] to an eternal home.
[32:12] &gt;&gt; So, we're here today to get to a
[32:14] different level, to get to a different
[32:16] place, to get to a different and a
[32:19] higher understanding, I believe, of what
[32:21] we are here for. May God make that a
[32:24] reality to us. I'm so thankful we have
[32:27] this opportunity to assemble such as we
[32:30] are. You may not know uh exactly how to
[32:34] appreciate it, but there surely will
[32:36] come a time in your life when you will
[32:39] really appreciate being able to be here
[32:42] like this. And uh I'm really nice to see
[32:47] you here, Brother Ed. and uh know
[32:50] brother Ed Hammeister is really
[32:52] assisting the school and the plans you
[32:55] may not know but as well as assisting in
[32:57] the ministry up in Edmonton at brother
[32:59] Harold Hillbrand's church brother
[33:02] Edimmeister is also an architect
[33:06] we need them sometime especially when
[33:09] they're largely free
[33:14] thank you brother Ed I don't know if
[33:16] that was free or not but I pitched it in
[33:23] God has really blessed us with some very
[33:26] skilled people in the kingdom of God.
[33:29] The devil hasn't got all of them. Do you
[33:30] know that
[33:32] &gt;&gt; devil hasn't got all of them?
[33:34] &gt;&gt; God's got just exactly what he needs at
[33:36] the time he needs. Which also brings me
[33:40] to uh
[33:43] the June 13th 14th date that was just
[33:47] announced by brother Rod. And uh you
[33:50] brothers that intend to go to the camp,
[33:51] you better try and do it all on the 13th
[33:54] because the 14th is brother Oed's
[33:57] wedding.
[33:58] And I think we need to be here for
[34:00] brother Oed's wedding. So, uh, I didn't
[34:04] really get that full announcement prior
[34:07] to, uh, the service, but I have an
[34:10] announcement about Brother Oed and
[34:12] Sister Anne's wedding, and they they've
[34:15] had to change the, uh, venue for the
[34:18] reception, and that will be uh, the
[34:21] notice will be on the board. They've
[34:23] just had to change that. uh but also he
[34:26] is requesting for those that because
[34:28] they have limited space and they gave
[34:31] out uh uh invitations and for those of
[34:33] you who have received an invitation you
[34:36] need to respond back to brother OED and
[34:39] sister an as quickly as possible because
[34:43] they need to make uh uh they need to
[34:46] make their reservations and the plans
[34:48] for those that are attending. So please,
[34:51] there was only a few that had returned
[34:53] the uh invitation saying that they were
[34:56] going to be there. So all who are going
[34:58] to be at the reception and of course the
[35:01] uh the service, we all want to be here
[35:03] for the wedding service. So we'll be
[35:05] announcing more about the time etc. But
[35:07] that is on June the 14th.
[35:10] I would like you to pray for Sister
[35:13] Anne's parents. Uh they're in
[35:16] Johannesburg.
[35:18] uh and and very very fine well- educated
[35:22] people and they are not allowing them to
[35:26] come to Canada to the wedding if you can
[35:28] believe that. It's just so bizarre. Uh I
[35:32] just don't understand the system
[35:34] anymore. All I can say is what the
[35:36] prophet said it's of the devil. Uh, I
[35:39] just can't understand how, you know, two
[35:41] people and they have their tickets and
[35:44] everything else and they say, "Well, we
[35:46] don't think you're going to come back."
[35:48] Uh, and uh, so they use that as an
[35:50] excuse and they're not able to come. And
[35:53] you can imagine what it is for a father
[35:55] not even able to come and and and see
[35:58] his daughter's wedding and the mother
[36:00] and and and for him to be able to walk
[36:01] down this aisle and give his daughter
[36:03] away. It's uh it's really sad uh you
[36:07] know and and more and more I'm I'm
[36:09] ashamed to have citizenship in a country
[36:12] that has those kind of regulations and
[36:15] don't have enough enough intelligence
[36:17] here to be able to put whatever
[36:20] regulations and I I told them just I'll
[36:23] write a letter we'll we'll post a bond
[36:27] we'll do whatever you want to do to see
[36:29] that these people are on the plane to go
[36:32] home and why a person can't uh see
[36:35] through that. I just don't understand it
[36:37] and I don't want to comment too much on
[36:39] it, but I really am disappointed in
[36:42] that. Uh but and so pray for them. The
[36:45] wedding is going to go on anyway.
[36:48] And uh and then also we want to be
[36:51] remembering brother Dier. Uh I believe
[36:54] brother Dier is ministering for brother
[36:56] uh brother Kelly Hildebrand in in
[36:58] Saskatchewan this weekend. And so
[37:01] remember them. and also brother Dier's
[37:03] father. Let's keep remembering him up. I
[37:07] just would like to see him raised up for
[37:09] the glory of God. Amen.
[37:12] Uh I want to uh
[37:16] say that a great servant of uh our Lord
[37:19] Jesus and a great servant of Christ in
[37:21] this message has gone on to his reward
[37:24] is brother Billy Andrews.
[37:26] And uh brother Billy Andrews uh left us
[37:30] on Friday morning. He had had a heart
[37:33] attack and we see him here. Uh God bless
[37:38] him. He's uh he's got a lot less
[37:41] problems than we have right now.
[37:45] And he was a certainly a great servant
[37:47] of Christ. He uh uh he served the Lord
[37:52] with everything that was in him.
[37:54] actually he had a very very successful
[37:56] evangelistic
[37:58] ministry. He had a large tent uh I saw
[38:02] and was actually at the location in one
[38:04] small city in Tennessee where there was
[38:06] 12,000 people in the tent and gathered
[38:10] there and he was uh during the 50s and
[38:12] the 60s had a very very uh uh
[38:16] wellattended and successful ministry and
[38:19] God used him much in praying for the
[38:22] sick. He heard about heard of the
[38:24] message. He uh uh didn't lay it down as
[38:29] such, but he felt to establish a church
[38:32] what they did uh established just
[38:34] outside of Murphreey'sboro in Tennessee
[38:37] and sponsored the Thanksgiving meetings
[38:40] which many of you here were in those
[38:42] Thanksgiving meetings and I uh I went
[38:46] down and joined with him and spoke those
[38:48] meetings for 19 years. So we have a a
[38:51] very very deep and abiding friendship.
[38:55] Uh we want to remember sister Eloise his
[38:59] wife and the congregation uh of his
[39:03] church and uh we want to thank God for a
[39:08] long life that was spent. I don't know
[39:11] exactly but I think he was uh either 79
[39:14] 80 years old somewhere along that. I can
[39:18] say that he loved the Lord Jesus with
[39:21] all of his heart and he labored boldly
[39:24] for Christ. He preached with uh
[39:27] unwavering faith and strength and uh
[39:31] they're going to have the service. There
[39:33] will be a service tomorrow. I will not
[39:36] be able to attend because it is
[39:38] tomorrow. They're having a viewing
[39:40] tonight and a and a service tomorrow.
[39:43] Brother Ernie Vil Noea will be
[39:45] representing us in the church here going
[39:49] uh to be with them and I we want to
[39:52] remember the family. if you would
[39:54] please. Uh, Brother Andrews is loved and
[39:59] well known also by uh many of the people
[40:01] in brother Joseph Hammed's church and we
[40:05] that they're going to be of course
[40:07] having some uh sorrow in their hearts,
[40:10] but we pray that God will comfort them.
[40:13] I would like to have you uh stand if you
[40:15] would and I would like to just have a a
[40:18] moment of silence as we contemplate a
[40:21] great servant of God that has crossed
[40:24] over and then we're going to have
[40:27] prayer.
[40:36] Dear heavenly father,
[40:40] we know that the life and the breath of
[40:43] all men,
[40:45] women, and all humans is in your hands.
[40:49] And you have seen fit, oh God, to call
[40:53] and call the name of brother Billy
[40:56] Andrews. And as Job said, you will call
[41:01] and he will answer. So you have called,
[41:05] but not only did you call now, you
[41:07] called years ago when he was a young
[41:09] man, and he and his wife heard the call,
[41:14] and they laid down their lives to serve
[41:16] you and to serve your people. And now,
[41:19] Father, his years of many years of labor
[41:23] are over. He labored early in the
[41:26] morning. He labored late in the evening
[41:28] and at night. He would be in prayer, oh
[41:32] God. And he prayed for the sick for
[41:34] hundreds if not thousands of hours. He
[41:37] prayed for the sick. Has saw many, many
[41:40] miracles, some which I know of, oh God.
[41:43] And I want to thank you for his life.
[41:46] Thank you, Father, for this life that
[41:48] has been fruitful. Thank you for this
[41:51] life, oh God, that you sent a light that
[41:54] crossed throughout the area down in the
[41:57] south and the southeast. And I pray,
[42:00] Father, that now, oh God, you'll receive
[42:02] our thanksgiving and my personal
[42:05] thanksgiving for the life of Brother
[42:07] Billy Andrews. And we're asking, oh God,
[42:10] there will be a special resource of
[42:12] comfort that Sister Eloise will be able
[42:15] to draw on. And she will even sense a
[42:18] reality of of the grace of God being
[42:21] poured into her life, Lord, and the
[42:23] comfort of the Holy Spirit for the
[42:25] congregation and those that have
[42:27] responsibility to carry on, oh God. And
[42:30] brother Joseph Hammed and the church
[42:32] there, Lord, and those throughout the
[42:34] community be with brother Ernie, Father,
[42:37] as he is there. And I pray that he'll be
[42:39] able to speak to the family on our
[42:40] behalf and be able, oh God, to let them
[42:44] know that we are standing with them at
[42:46] this time. And pray, Father, you'll
[42:48] bring them through this time more
[42:50] victorious, uh, more victorious and with
[42:53] more maturity and more thanksgiving. In
[42:56] the name of Jesus Christ, we ask these
[42:58] things. Amen.
[43:00] &gt;&gt; Amen. God bless you. You may be seated.
[43:06] Now we have for some time
[43:09] uh we've needed an increase in our uh
[43:12] number of our deacons and uh that has
[43:15] been perhaps a a year or more. Uh and
[43:19] I'd like to make a confession to the
[43:21] assembly. I know it's not a surprise to
[43:25] um many many of you but I'm very slow.
[43:28] I'm very very slow. I'm slow to do
[43:31] things. I'm slow to get things done. I'm
[43:34] slow to make decisions. I was born in
[43:36] October and I understand that's Libra.
[43:39] And brother uh uh brother Vin told me
[43:42] that's just impossible. I can't do
[43:44] anything about it. I have to weigh
[43:45] things out. So, how long do I weigh
[43:47] things out? I weigh things out till
[43:49] there's hardly anything left to weigh.
[43:51] And uh you have to forgive me. It's just
[43:53] the way I am. And I I've prayed about
[43:56] that and I asked the Lord to help speed
[43:58] me up, but it's just uh sometimes it's
[44:01] just very very difficult. And I I wait
[44:04] and I think that perhaps God who's
[44:06] eternal and I'm an eternal son that I
[44:08] can just wait on and on and he's going
[44:11] to do something. And uh you know what he
[44:13] does? He does do things. And lots of
[44:16] times if you get right in there and you
[44:18] know I just make a big mess of it. But I
[44:21] just let him I sit back and let him. And
[44:24] you know God's wheels grind slow but
[44:29] they grind very fine. and he does get
[44:33] things done and often not on our
[44:36] schedule but he gets things done and
[44:38] sometimes he can move very very quickly
[44:41] and so consequently
[44:43] uh there are the rare moment when I've
[44:46] been able to move very very quickly but
[44:48] the deacons have said well we need more
[44:50] deacons we need more deacons and I
[44:53] waited on God there are two names I
[44:55] couldn't and and part of this is because
[44:58] uh I I wait for his inspiration
[45:02] And then when uh and then even when I a
[45:05] name will come to me in a a life and I
[45:08] watch it and I think about it because we
[45:11] have so many here in the congregation
[45:13] very very qualified people and I
[45:18] I have to tell you this morning that I I
[45:21] also have hesitation to call and even
[45:24] ask a brother to take such a position
[45:27] because I feel that they miss a lot of
[45:29] the their standing they're directing,
[45:31] they're talking to people, etc., and
[45:34] miss much of the meeting. Myself, if I
[45:36] had my choice, I'd sooner be able to
[45:38] come and sit down in the service, and I
[45:40] feel badly about that. But there was two
[45:43] brothers and their names were before me
[45:46] for a few months. And then I spoke with
[45:49] each of them and told them that I would
[45:53] like them to pray about this. And then
[45:56] they've prayed for another two to three
[45:58] weeks. And then that's been another two
[46:01] to three weeks that I let come by to
[46:03] list time. I'd like to just uh bring
[46:06] before the congregation
[46:09] uh brother Billy Fer and brother Sam
[46:12] Stall. And I wonder if those brothers
[46:14] would just come and stand here please if
[46:16] they would uh while I read some
[46:19] scripture. And I also want to say to the
[46:21] congregation that uh it we'll we'll do
[46:25] exactly what the prophet of God said. We
[46:27] let these brothers serve for a few
[46:30] weeks, he said, and see how they like it
[46:34] and see how the congregation likes it.
[46:36] And then if everyone feels comfortable
[46:40] and happy with that and the brethren are
[46:43] happy with that, then we uh gather
[46:46] around them, lay hands upon them and
[46:48] appoint them into this uh into this
[46:51] position. But the scripture says this,
[46:55] uh, Brother Billy and brother Sam,
[46:58] likewise must the deacons be grave, not
[47:02] double tonged, not given to much wine,
[47:05] nor greedy, a filthy lucer, holding the
[47:08] mystery of the faith in pure conscience.
[47:11] And let those uh let these also first be
[47:15] proved. And that's what brother Brandham
[47:16] speaks about these few weeks. He didn't
[47:20] give a specific time, but he said these
[47:22] few weeks, let them be proved. And he
[47:24] said that see how you like it. See how
[47:28] the congregation likes it. Those words
[47:30] he used and just see if you feel
[47:32] comfortable about that. And I would like
[47:34] to say that both of these brothers when
[47:36] I sat with them individually
[47:40] and spoke to them about this taking this
[47:43] responsibility
[47:45] uh they both in their own words said
[47:48] they had been having a desire to do
[47:51] something for God and I just felt that
[47:54] that was God that laid that on their
[47:56] heart. It says, "And let these also
[47:59] first be proved, and let them use the
[48:02] office of a deacon, being found
[48:04] blameless.
[48:06] Even so must their wives be grave, not
[48:09] slanderous,
[48:11] sober, faithful in all things. Let the
[48:15] deacons be the husbands of one wife,
[48:18] ruling their children and their own
[48:20] houses well. For they that have used the
[48:24] office of a deacon well purchased to
[48:27] themselves a good degree and great
[48:30] boldness in the faith which is in Christ
[48:33] Jesus. And that in the original Greek
[48:36] says they acquire to themselves an
[48:39] honorable station and much confidence in
[48:43] that faith which is in Christ Jesus.
[48:46] Brother Brandham said this
[48:49] just these points. A deacon is a
[48:52] custodian or a guardian in the house of
[48:55] God. Number two, he is one that keeps
[48:58] things in order. Number three, deacons
[49:01] must meet any opposition. And number
[49:05] four, deacons are the policemen in the
[49:07] church. Number five, they keep order
[49:10] with kindliness and friendliness.
[49:14] And then he said after some months and a
[49:17] prayerful time that is my responsibility
[49:22] that I want to know want to let the
[49:24] church know that I was uh very very
[49:27] serious about these things. And then
[49:31] brother Brandham made this is a quote in
[49:34] placing of deacons. Then these men shall
[49:37] serve. And if they feel that they will
[49:40] accept this office, then they will come
[49:42] for a short time to see if they feel
[49:45] that maybe God has called them. And if
[49:48] later they feel that they are
[49:49] disqualified, then they have a right in
[49:52] the next few weeks to resign that the
[49:55] office that someone else could be
[49:57] appointed in their place. Said, but
[49:59] first they must be appointed. That's
[50:01] what we're doing now. and see how they
[50:04] like it and how the congregation likes
[50:06] it. Then if it's all right on both
[50:09] sides, then we make these men ordained
[50:13] deacons. Now he said, "Now, now you have
[50:17] said, let these first be tried and see
[50:20] if they desire this office." And that is
[50:23] what we're doing. I'm just going over
[50:24] that. And in prayer, he said, "God bless
[50:27] these men
[50:29] and may they serve this office with all
[50:31] their hearts, knowing that it is a
[50:33] purchasing through them a great degree
[50:37] in heaven." I thought that was very,
[50:40] very lovely. Someday when the books of
[50:42] heaven shall be closed. May the book of
[50:45] the celestial beings and in the great
[50:48] book of heaven be opened. May their
[50:51] names be 100% before God and the Savior
[50:56] and all the heavenly hosts to be the
[50:58] same as in his kingdom. Bless them Lord.
[51:02] And may they serve his office well in
[51:05] Jesus name. And we thank you for them.
[51:08] I want to have you bow your head if you
[51:10] would. I want to pray with these
[51:12] brethren as they face these next uh
[51:15] these next number of weeks and this
[51:18] position that they have prayed already
[51:20] about earnestly.
[51:22] Dear heavenly father,
[51:26] you know the need that is in your body,
[51:28] the body of Jesus Christ, the bride body
[51:31] of Jesus Christ. And here stands before
[51:34] me, Lord, two men. Our brother Billy
[51:37] Fcher, Brother Sam Stall. Men who have
[51:41] lived, oh God, before you with a good
[51:45] degree of uh sincerity
[51:48] and righteousness, their wives, uh their
[51:51] families. Oh Lord, I pray, dear Lord,
[51:55] that you will look down now upon this
[51:57] scene and that the Holy Spirit shall be
[52:01] in attendance at this moment. I pray
[52:03] that you will bless these brothers as
[52:06] they have solemnly and seriously
[52:08] considered, oh God, their affirmative
[52:12] decision in this regard. And I pray,
[52:15] dear Lord, within the hearts of the
[52:17] congregation, Father, they will realize
[52:19] that there is an order and a way that
[52:21] things are to be done and we seek to
[52:24] follow, Father, the order that you have
[52:27] laid within the congregation. I thank
[52:30] you for the deacons that you have given
[52:32] us, oh Lord, and the officers of the
[52:35] church. And I pray, Father, your
[52:37] blessing upon every member that is
[52:40] seated here today. I ask, oh God, that
[52:44] the Holy Spirit shall shall shall
[52:47] sanction every move and every decision
[52:50] for your glory. And now, Father, your
[52:53] blessings upon these brothers in Jesus
[52:56] Christ's name as they enter into this
[53:00] ministry. We pray. Amen. Amen. God bless
[53:03] you, Brother Sam. God bless you. Amen.
[53:06] God bless you, Brother Billy. Amen.
[53:15] All right, we're going to read some
[53:16] scripture and go right to Are you ready
[53:19] for the word?
[53:21] &gt;&gt; All right, you can stand. I wanted
[53:23] Brother Rod to just help me to sing. I'd
[53:25] like to just sing a verse. My Jesus, I
[53:27] love thee. I know thou art mine. I was
[53:30] singing it this morning. And notice, if
[53:33] you would, the words of this song. My
[53:36] Jesus, I love thee. I know thou art
[53:38] mine.
[53:40] for thee all the follyies of sin. That's
[53:44] all the follyies of unbelief. I resign.
[53:47] Let's just put that all out of our heart
[53:49] right now. And at at this moment, I have
[53:52] some serious things to say this morning.
[53:54] And I I believe that God will just make
[53:56] a way and open the door that it will
[53:59] touch our hearts
[54:02] where we There's some spiritual needs
[54:04] here.
[54:05] All of you that may not have it. But let
[54:07] me tell you, there's some spiritual
[54:08] needs in our congregation. And you that
[54:11] have a spiritual need, I want you to be
[54:14] in full expectation that it'll be
[54:16] touched and that you'll make the correct
[54:19] decision based on that. And don't leave
[54:22] it. Don't leave it.
[54:25] You want to be now the way you're going
[54:27] to be when you cross over. And I just
[54:30] said to the Lord this morning, I don't
[54:32] want to have to. And to me, it's a
[54:35] paradox how people will live a a life at
[54:39] a certain level and just expect that all
[54:43] problems and everything is just vanished
[54:45] when I cross over. Let's tend to it now.
[54:49] &gt;&gt; That's what we're here for.
[54:51] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen?
[54:53] &gt;&gt; Amen. All right, let's just sing that
[54:54] verse, please.
[54:59] My Jesus
[55:03] I love
[55:05] thee. I
[55:09] th
[55:14] for thee.
[55:24] I
[55:26] [Applause]
[55:28] gra
[55:30] [Music]
[55:35] I see.
[55:45] I love
[55:48] thee. My Jesus
[55:53] is
[55:55] singing that verse again. My Jesus
[56:00] I
[56:04] know
[56:10] for me
[56:20] [Music]
[56:24] Heat.
[56:27] Heat.
[56:41] I love
[56:43] thee. My Jesus
[56:48] is now.
[56:53] &gt;&gt; That last line is my Jesus is now.
[56:57] Right now.
[56:59] &gt;&gt; If ever I loved you, it's this moment.
[57:02] &gt;&gt; I'll have you turn in your Bibles,
[57:04] please, to Matthew the 15th chapter.
[57:14] We're going to read from verse 21.
[57:29] Then Jesus went thence and departed into
[57:32] the coast of Ty and Sidon.
[57:35] And behold, a woman of Canaan came out
[57:38] of the same coast and cried unto him,
[57:41] saying, Have mercy on me, oh Lord, thou
[57:45] son of David. My daughter is grievously
[57:49] vexed with a devil. But he answered her
[57:52] not a word. And his disciples came and
[57:55] besought him, saying, Send her away, for
[57:58] she crith after us. And he answered and
[58:01] said, "I am not sent but under the lost
[58:04] sheep of the house of Israel." Then came
[58:08] she and worshiped him, saying, Lord,
[58:11] help me. And he answered and said, "It
[58:14] is not meat to take the children's bread
[58:17] and cast it to the dogs." And she said,
[58:21] "Truth, Lord, yet the dogs eat the
[58:24] crumbs which fall from the master's
[58:27] table."
[58:28] Then Jesus answered and said unto
[58:31] her,"Oh woman, great is thy faith. Be it
[58:36] unto thee even as thy as thou wilt, and
[58:40] her daughter was made whole from that
[58:42] very hour." Mark uh the uh in his
[58:47] gospel,
[58:49] he records the same account. And then uh
[58:54] when Jesus answers her responds to her
[58:58] and says that it's not meat to take the
[59:01] children's bread and cast it unto the
[59:04] dogs. And she answered and said unto
[59:07] him, "Yay, Lord, yet the dogs under the
[59:10] table eat the children's crumbs."
[59:14] And he said unto her, "For this saying,
[59:19] go your way." For this saying, go your
[59:23] way. The devil is gone out of your
[59:26] daughter.
[59:28] &gt;&gt; Isn't that incredible
[59:30] &gt;&gt; for this saying? Amen. God bless you as
[59:33] you have your seats.
[59:39] There are several events in this woman's
[59:42] life
[59:45] uh that come together all at once. And
[59:48] these events coming together in this
[59:50] vortex as aware of her life thrusts her
[59:56] just it it it is like a it's like a
[1:00:00] launch to her. It thrusts her into the
[1:00:03] presence of Jesus Christ and the
[1:00:06] desperation.
[1:00:07] And I want you to notice that it is the
[1:00:09] combination of these events and these
[1:00:12] circumstances in her life that caused
[1:00:16] her literally to become a part of Christ
[1:00:20] because her account is told here and
[1:00:24] this is Christ. This word is Christ. And
[1:00:27] her account now fell into scripture into
[1:00:31] holy writ.
[1:00:34] And this didn't happen just by an
[1:00:35] accident. God knew this before the
[1:00:38] foundation of the world and this event
[1:00:41] happened in such a way all of these
[1:00:43] circumstances
[1:00:45] that were perhaps very very difficult to
[1:00:48] her. I want to spend some time and just
[1:00:51] belabor that a few moments.
[1:00:54] Number one,
[1:00:56] she was
[1:00:58] at a huge disadvantage
[1:01:01] because she was a gentile. And Jesus had
[1:01:05] said, that's why he said, "It's not meat
[1:01:07] to cast the children's bread or that
[1:01:10] which is for the Jewish nation or the
[1:01:12] Jewish people to cast it to the dogs
[1:01:16] which were Samaritans and Gentiles which
[1:01:19] were considered heathens." And the Bible
[1:01:21] says in in Mark's gospel that she was a
[1:01:24] Greek. She was a Seraphanician, but she
[1:01:27] was of a Greek descent. And it says so
[1:01:30] she was at a huge disadvantage at being
[1:01:33] a gentile. That's number one. In other
[1:01:36] words, I'm just wanting to say she she
[1:01:38] didn't have things in her favor.
[1:01:41] Number two, she had carried the burden
[1:01:44] for how many years? We don't know. But
[1:01:46] she carried the burden of having a
[1:01:50] child, a daughter. The Bible says,
[1:01:53] grievously vexed
[1:01:57] of a devil.
[1:01:59] And uh to be vexed is to be under the
[1:02:02] power or possessed of a demon.
[1:02:07] And these are persons that are afflicted
[1:02:10] with us with especially they could have
[1:02:12] a it could be a physical disease
[1:02:16] either bodily or mentally
[1:02:19] and such as paralysis or blindness or
[1:02:21] deafness or loss of speech or epilepsy
[1:02:25] or something. But this girl had a she
[1:02:27] was
[1:02:29] seriously vexed. And the Jews believed
[1:02:32] that demons had entered their bodies and
[1:02:36] held possession of them. Not only to
[1:02:39] afflict them physically, but also to
[1:02:42] dethrone the reason and uh and and and
[1:02:47] to take away the consciousness of them.
[1:02:50] and accordingly possessed they they
[1:02:53] would possess and express their mind and
[1:02:56] their consciousness through that
[1:02:59] individual and that's what the Jews
[1:03:01] believed concerning it.
[1:03:04] Number three, this woman now recognized
[1:03:07] she saw someone and recognized in Christ
[1:03:11] that here was someone who could help
[1:03:14] her.
[1:03:16] And number four, she approached him only
[1:03:20] to be insulted and turned away.
[1:03:24] [Music]
[1:03:25] &gt;&gt; And number five, however, she possessed
[1:03:30] a faith that was beyond offense.
[1:03:35] She appeared to be beyond offense. She
[1:03:38] couldn't be offended.
[1:03:40] And I would say that would be a lesson
[1:03:43] for almost everyone here. because we're
[1:03:45] so sensitive, it seems, and so conscious
[1:03:49] of our own selves uh that we become
[1:03:53] upset or irritated at how we're handled
[1:03:56] or how we're responded to. And she
[1:03:59] couldn't be responded to
[1:04:02] bad enough. There was no way to offend
[1:04:05] her. Even the disciples coming to the
[1:04:08] master, they they had done what they
[1:04:10] could do. and they coming to him and
[1:04:12] say, "Send her away for she's troubling
[1:04:14] us." So, she was a problem
[1:04:18] and she possessed this kind of a faith.
[1:04:21] And number six, her steadfast
[1:04:25] unwavering and persistent faith. And she
[1:04:29] said to the Lord, "Truth, Lord.
[1:04:34] It's not meat to cast the children's
[1:04:37] bread to the dogs."
[1:04:40] And I don't know. I think it's more.
[1:04:41] It's got to be more than a story. It has
[1:04:43] to be more than a scriptural account.
[1:04:47] &gt;&gt; It has to be more than that. We cannot
[1:04:50] sit here and feel in this age when we've
[1:04:53] been so anointed with people's rights.
[1:04:57] And and believe it or not, don't think
[1:04:58] that it stops at the doors of the
[1:05:00] church. It comes into the church. We
[1:05:02] pack this that I have certain rights.
[1:05:04] Even though we may not say that, but we
[1:05:07] have that sense. We have that feeling.
[1:05:09] We have rights to be treated a certain
[1:05:11] way. We have rights to be respected a
[1:05:13] certain way. We have rights to be
[1:05:15] acknowledged a certain way. But now this
[1:05:17] woman, she needed something from God.
[1:05:21] She needed something from Christ. And
[1:05:24] and uh regardless of how she was
[1:05:26] treated, she was determined to uh to
[1:05:30] obtain this. Says the truth, Lord. But
[1:05:34] yet the dogs eat the crumbs that fall
[1:05:36] from the master's table. And he said,
[1:05:39] "For this saying."
[1:05:42] I was going to entitle this title this
[1:05:44] message this morning for this saying,
[1:05:46] but I want to
[1:05:49] expand on that very substantially.
[1:05:52] I want you to think about this very,
[1:05:54] very deeply this service this morning. I
[1:05:57] want to speak on the revelation
[1:06:00] of the unveiling of God
[1:06:03] in our life, in your life. The
[1:06:06] revelation
[1:06:08] now, Brother Tom sp uh stood to the
[1:06:10] pulpit here on Wednesday. If you and
[1:06:14] perhaps number of you were not able to
[1:06:16] be here on Wednesday, I hope you had a
[1:06:20] good reason for not being here. It was a
[1:06:21] milestone message. I I don't often say
[1:06:26] uh that about brother Tom. I will give
[1:06:28] commendation about other people's
[1:06:30] ministry, but sometimes I hesitant on
[1:06:32] that because I think well people's just
[1:06:34] saying that because he's my son-in-law.
[1:06:36] Well, I'm going to push that aside. Say
[1:06:38] Wednesday was a milestone message
[1:06:41] &gt;&gt; and if you haven't heard it, you need to
[1:06:43] hear it. And as soon as he started on
[1:06:45] Revelation, right while you were still
[1:06:48] standing waiting to read the scripture,
[1:06:50] he started on Revelation. And it was
[1:06:52] right exactly in in the channel that God
[1:06:54] had been already dealing with me. And my
[1:06:57] last service was on uh on revelation. So
[1:07:00] that's why I want you to we have the
[1:07:02] channel of the Holy Spirit.
[1:07:03] &gt;&gt; I want you to know we have the mind of
[1:07:05] Christ. I want you to listen very very
[1:07:08] attentively. We need revelation. And I
[1:07:10] stood in this pulpit
[1:07:13] saying to you that I had to ask myself,
[1:07:17] what have I had that's really a
[1:07:20] revelation from God?
[1:07:22] And I had to think back honestly,
[1:07:25] sincerely. And I have identified a few
[1:07:29] times,
[1:07:30] maybe four times, there may be more. But
[1:07:34] I know that I had a revelation. I had a
[1:07:36] revelation
[1:07:37] of God's prophet.
[1:07:40] Malachi 4 absolute unindisputable
[1:07:44] revelation from God said, "Did I get up
[1:07:48] and jump? Did I feel chills? I felt
[1:07:50] nothing.
[1:07:51] The word of God just came alive." Of
[1:07:54] course, it's there.
[1:07:55] &gt;&gt; Of course, this is the only ministry
[1:07:57] that fits it. The serpent seed, absolute
[1:08:00] revelation of the serpent seed saw it
[1:08:02] from Genesis to Revelation to the book
[1:08:04] of Revelation. As soon as as soon as God
[1:08:06] opened it up, just saw it. It just
[1:08:08] rippled all the way through. Of course,
[1:08:10] that's why they had circumcision in the
[1:08:12] Old Testament. That's why it was blood.
[1:08:13] That's why it had to be Calvary. That's
[1:08:15] why it had to be a cross. That's why,
[1:08:17] oh, this is why it was the lamb slain
[1:08:19] before the foundation of the world. It
[1:08:20] just came as a revelation.
[1:08:25] &gt;&gt; The Apostle Peter,
[1:08:27] I want to be very careful so I don't get
[1:08:29] ahead of myself. So, you pray for me.
[1:08:31] &gt;&gt; The Apostle Peter and Matthew 16th
[1:08:35] chapter, don't turn to it. you know it
[1:08:37] real well. I just want to refer to it.
[1:08:40] When Jesus said, "Who do men say that I
[1:08:43] am?"
[1:08:44] And they said, "Well, Jeremiah, Elias,
[1:08:47] one of the other prophets, who do you
[1:08:49] say that I am?" Peter said, "Thou art
[1:08:52] the Christ,
[1:08:54] son of the living God." Jesus said,
[1:08:57] "Blessed art thou, Peter, for flesh and
[1:09:00] blood hath not hath not revealed this
[1:09:03] unto you, but my father and upon this
[1:09:05] rock. And now that the whole foundation
[1:09:08] fundamental part of the message today is
[1:09:11] upon this rock I'll build my church.
[1:09:14] Brother Bram said the rock was not
[1:09:15] Christ and the rock was not Peter as the
[1:09:18] Catholics say and not Christ as the
[1:09:20] Protestants say. It was the revelation
[1:09:22] of who Christ was.
[1:09:25] &gt;&gt; Thou art the Christ.
[1:09:27] Now, brother Brandham and and and this
[1:09:30] is so very very uh these are fundamental
[1:09:33] powerful statements that I have to make.
[1:09:36] Christ was that
[1:09:40] essence of God. He said he came from the
[1:09:42] bosom of the father. Christ was that
[1:09:45] which came out from God.
[1:09:48] &gt;&gt; And this is the difference. This is
[1:09:50] where the revelation has to come. That
[1:09:53] and this is the fundamental truth of
[1:09:55] this service this morning. Where you
[1:09:58] need revelation, where Peter needed
[1:10:00] revelation was that which comes out from
[1:10:04] God,
[1:10:06] that which comes forth from God is what
[1:10:09] requires revelation to be able to
[1:10:12] identify that that came out from God.
[1:10:15] Peter's revelation was, "Thou art the
[1:10:18] Christ. You are the Messiah. You are
[1:10:21] that which has proceeded out from God.
[1:10:24] You you that's what you are. You're the
[1:10:28] Christ. Now today,
[1:10:31] it doesn't require revelation to believe
[1:10:33] that there's a God.
[1:10:35] &gt;&gt; I drove past a temple this last week.
[1:10:38] The Sikhs, and we have many of them
[1:10:40] here. The Sikhs from India believe in
[1:10:43] one God.
[1:10:44] &gt;&gt; The Muslims believe in one God, Allah.
[1:10:47] Multitudes believe billions of people
[1:10:50] believe in one God or believe that there
[1:10:53] is a God or a multiplicity of gods, they
[1:10:57] believe in God, that's no revelation.
[1:11:01] &gt;&gt; There's not an iota of revelation with
[1:11:03] that. But if there is a God and this God
[1:11:07] that fills all time and space, this God
[1:11:10] that is God, this God who created all
[1:11:14] things, this God who brought you and I
[1:11:17] on the scene, where is he as of this
[1:11:20] moment, where who who can identify and
[1:11:24] say this is God? This is the unveiling
[1:11:27] of God. This has come forth from God.
[1:11:30] And this is why prophets were essential
[1:11:34] because they would come to their people
[1:11:37] and God would send their prophets send
[1:11:39] his prophets and they would identify the
[1:11:41] word of God the sayings of God and the
[1:11:44] people of God and for and and and that's
[1:11:48] why they were rejected and brought into
[1:11:51] persecuted into a persecuted place and
[1:11:53] I'm going to enlarge on that in a few
[1:11:55] moments. But now
[1:11:58] this woman that I have read about, she
[1:12:02] had something
[1:12:04] within her
[1:12:07] that required
[1:12:09] this specific set of circumstances
[1:12:12] to happen in order for it to come out.
[1:12:16] She had you you've heard today very very
[1:12:20] much has spoke about self-discovery.
[1:12:23] We've got books on self-discovery.
[1:12:25] thousands of them if not millions on
[1:12:28] self-discovery.
[1:12:30] People are what what is it self self
[1:12:32] trying to discover something about
[1:12:34] yourself. Uh we have they have places
[1:12:38] actually geographical locations that you
[1:12:40] can go and come into a certain uh state
[1:12:43] of euphoria to try to discover yourself.
[1:12:47] People leave America and they go to
[1:12:50] India. They go to Nepal. they go to some
[1:12:54] uh you know uh place where they can
[1:12:57] maybe get and rise into some mental
[1:13:00] state through meditation and try and
[1:13:02] discover some thing something about
[1:13:05] themselves. I'm going to make a
[1:13:07] statement right now.
[1:13:10] Every person that's seated here and
[1:13:11] every person that's listening to me on
[1:13:13] the internet at this moment has within
[1:13:17] them
[1:13:19] a resource that they don't know anything
[1:13:22] about.
[1:13:24] And God allows
[1:13:27] circumstances
[1:13:28] that you don't like.
[1:13:30] &gt;&gt; He allows trials that you don't invite.
[1:13:35] &gt;&gt; He allows adversity that you wish you
[1:13:38] could dismiss. He allows pressures that
[1:13:41] we wish we could escape. He allows this
[1:13:44] upon us for the specific purpose that
[1:13:47] there's something within us that has to
[1:13:49] rise up to the occasion. And that which
[1:13:53] rises up is a is a we need a revelation
[1:13:57] that that is God within us.
[1:14:01] &gt;&gt; And thus the woman had to be she had to
[1:14:04] have a demon-possessed child.
[1:14:07] You may misunderstand that God knew she
[1:14:10] had a demon-possessed child. God knew
[1:14:13] this woman had was under under this
[1:14:16] crushing burden for these years. God
[1:14:19] knew she perhaps tried many many places
[1:14:22] to find an answer for this dilemma she
[1:14:27] had. And and why she may have said year
[1:14:30] after year, why do I have to live with
[1:14:32] this? And now she sees a a window of
[1:14:36] opportunity. Here's a man. He's prayed
[1:14:39] for the sick. He's healed and raised the
[1:14:42] dead. Oh, I've heard about these
[1:14:44] miracles and now I come. This this would
[1:14:46] be my answer. Oh, thou son of David.
[1:14:52] &gt;&gt; My child is grievously
[1:14:55] ill, grievously vexed.
[1:14:58] Come and heal her. Amen.
[1:15:01] &gt;&gt; Good.
[1:15:02] &gt;&gt; And the disciples, his faithful
[1:15:04] apostles,
[1:15:06] get away. We don't have time. Get away.
[1:15:10] What? What kind of people are you? Be
[1:15:13] still. Be quiet. Our master hasn't got
[1:15:15] time for you. She couldn't be stealed.
[1:15:19] She couldn't stop her crying out. And
[1:15:23] then to have Christ himself say, "It's
[1:15:27] not meat for me to give the children's
[1:15:29] bread to the dogs." I tell you, there's
[1:15:32] probably very few even here that could
[1:15:35] master that kind of an insult.
[1:15:38] &gt;&gt; We read about it. We hear about it. Oh,
[1:15:40] yeah. Yeah. That was her. I'm talking
[1:15:42] about you.
[1:15:43] &gt;&gt; I'm talking about your situation. Maybe
[1:15:46] you got it all mapped out how it should
[1:15:47] be answered and how God should do it and
[1:15:49] and how the people should do it and how
[1:15:51] they should respond and you're not
[1:15:53] getting that you're you're carrying it
[1:15:54] by yourself and saying doesn't somebody
[1:15:57] understand doesn't some but God has you
[1:15:59] going through that because deep within
[1:16:02] you is a certain resource and God is
[1:16:05] going to allow this to to allow you to
[1:16:08] arrive to a station called desperation.
[1:16:12] &gt;&gt; You get desperate before God. Oh God,
[1:16:15] and you'll find some rising up within
[1:16:18] you. So rising up, it's not coming out
[1:16:21] of your emotions. It's coming from the
[1:16:23] seed of God until a faith rose up. Said,
[1:16:27] "I haven't seen such faith like this."
[1:16:33] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:16:34] &gt;&gt; It took all of that to bring that faith
[1:16:36] out.
[1:16:38] &gt;&gt; And when it rose up,
[1:16:40] &gt;&gt; she wasn't She had no consciousness. I'm
[1:16:43] coming to the moment of my greatest
[1:16:45] experience. I'm going to be recorded in
[1:16:47] the history of the scriptures. There are
[1:16:49] millions that are going to read about
[1:16:51] me. She had none of that. She's focused
[1:16:53] on one thing, her need and my answer.
[1:16:56] And it must happen. And this is the only
[1:16:57] one. I don't care what they say. I don't
[1:16:59] care anything about it. I know that this
[1:17:01] message has it.
[1:17:03] &gt;&gt; I don't care how many people go
[1:17:05] sideways. I don't care what happens in
[1:17:07] this church or that church or what this
[1:17:09] person says or where they go. I know it
[1:17:12] has my answer.
[1:17:16] &gt;&gt; And you watch it work.
[1:17:19] &gt;&gt; You watch it happen.
[1:17:21] &gt;&gt; And I hold you. This woman remains
[1:17:24] absolutely steadfast, unmovable,
[1:17:26] unshakable, and she could not be she
[1:17:29] could not be embarrassed. She could not
[1:17:31] be insulted sufficiently. She had the
[1:17:33] she knew that she had a hold of
[1:17:35] something that was real. Amen.
[1:17:40] &gt;&gt; I don't think that she realized the
[1:17:44] level of faith that she possessed, but
[1:17:46] took all of these things. Sometimes we
[1:17:49] don't see
[1:17:51] the answer. And I know I'm talking to
[1:17:53] everybody.
[1:17:57] So, nobody needs to cower down and say,
[1:17:59] "Well, he's not. This is for somebody
[1:18:01] else."
[1:18:03] Everybody
[1:18:05] here can
[1:18:08] can acknowledge that we don't always see
[1:18:10] the answer
[1:18:12] &gt;&gt; for what we've prayed for.
[1:18:19] And yet I would say
[1:18:22] it may be per chance that the reason
[1:18:24] that God has not answered you
[1:18:28] is that there's still something deep
[1:18:30] within you
[1:18:32] that needs to rise
[1:18:36] to the surface.
[1:18:39] &gt;&gt; You need to go on a journey of
[1:18:40] self-discovery.
[1:18:42] &gt;&gt; Amen. And you'll find out even in the
[1:18:45] world people the reason why they have
[1:18:48] all of this uh uh all of the books and
[1:18:51] all of the volumes and all of the
[1:18:54] seminars and whatever more on
[1:18:55] self-discovery is because they know that
[1:18:58] people can be you can be a better you
[1:19:00] and and so they work at that level
[1:19:04] physically speaking. You've heard
[1:19:06] stories. I've heard stories. I could
[1:19:08] relate some. I'm not going to take the
[1:19:10] time.
[1:19:12] I and I've experienced it myself. When a
[1:19:15] person comes to a a moment in their life
[1:19:18] of extreme danger, it's a crisis. And
[1:19:22] I've had it myself.
[1:19:24] And I tell you, I had a I had an animal
[1:19:26] after me. I had an animal who was going
[1:19:29] to tear me to shreds. And I was just a a
[1:19:32] lad in my early teens.
[1:19:36] And I tell you what, I crossed a I I
[1:19:40] crossed a space of ground and and was
[1:19:43] over top of a a corral. I'm talking
[1:19:46] about a corral where they keep wild
[1:19:47] horses and things in that up several
[1:19:50] feet high. I was across this I was
[1:19:53] across this space of ground and over
[1:19:55] that corral in an absolute instant.
[1:19:59] And I turned around. I don't know how I
[1:20:01] got over that corral. It was probably
[1:20:03] twice my height. I got over that. I'll
[1:20:06] tell you what person, you know, we use
[1:20:07] the phrase adrenaline. Well, it whatever
[1:20:10] it is, but you you find you got a
[1:20:12] resource in you that you didn't know
[1:20:14] that you had, but you can sure you you
[1:20:17] don't you you can't explain it. If you
[1:20:19] had to explain it right after, you can't
[1:20:20] explain it, but it was there.
[1:20:23] &gt;&gt; It's a reality. It actually happened. It
[1:20:26] actually functioned. And people have
[1:20:28] done impossible feats. Amen.
[1:20:31] &gt;&gt; They have lifted things in a matter of
[1:20:33] crisis because they had to do it.
[1:20:35] &gt;&gt; And somehow they found the strength.
[1:20:37] They found the determination. They found
[1:20:40] whatever it took for that moment.
[1:20:44] &gt;&gt; True.
[1:20:45] &gt;&gt; Hello. We're all human here.
[1:20:47] &gt;&gt; You've been there.
[1:20:51] &gt;&gt; That's because you have that resource
[1:20:54] within you. But now I'm talking
[1:20:56] spiritually. We discover there comes a
[1:21:01] there there comes a a spiritual
[1:21:04] moment or a time in our lives
[1:21:08] when we find that there's a a a resource
[1:21:12] of strength or stamina
[1:21:15] within us.
[1:21:17] And that's when we become aware
[1:21:20] I I I'm I've got a channel open. I've
[1:21:23] got an avenue. I'm tied into something
[1:21:27] that's beyond me. It's beyond my world.
[1:21:30] It's beyond my understanding. But I have
[1:21:33] I can tell you I've gone through crisis,
[1:21:35] many of them. But there are a few
[1:21:37] occasions when I found that God dropped
[1:21:41] in a wisdom.
[1:21:44] God dropped in a comfort.
[1:21:47] &gt;&gt; God dropped in a grace. Been times when
[1:21:51] you were just in an absolute quandry. It
[1:21:54] hadn't seemed like there was no answer.
[1:21:56] But in the midst of that, God dropped in
[1:21:59] an answer.
[1:22:00] &gt;&gt; And you knew that. You knew that this
[1:22:02] was the way.
[1:22:04] &gt;&gt; You knew that. You knew that this was
[1:22:05] the decision.
[1:22:07] &gt;&gt; True
[1:22:13] in a in a thyron church age. a a quote
[1:22:18] we often refer to,
[1:22:21] brother Brandis quoting. I will put no
[1:22:23] another burden upon them.
[1:22:26] And he says the the word for burden is a
[1:22:28] weight or the pressure.
[1:22:31] The pressures of the dark ages was
[1:22:33] either bend or be broken.
[1:22:36] Bow or die. It was the Inquisition and
[1:22:40] the power of the empire that was backing
[1:22:42] it up. Satanic worship. Be organized.
[1:22:47] Pay or pay with your life. said, "Each
[1:22:50] age
[1:22:52] has has had its pressures."
[1:22:55] I know we read this often and we let it
[1:22:58] fall off of our lips, but I want to
[1:23:00] suggest to you that we need to think
[1:23:02] about it more deeply. He said, for
[1:23:04] example, the great burden of this last
[1:23:09] age is the pressure, the pressure of
[1:23:12] riches.
[1:23:14] &gt;&gt; Didn't say the pressure of having
[1:23:15] riches, but the pressure of riches.
[1:23:19] soft living
[1:23:22] and a nervous tensions in a complex age.
[1:23:27] Those things nervous tension in a
[1:23:29] complex age that we seem so unfitted to
[1:23:33] live in. Brother Tom touched on this
[1:23:36] without using this quote talking about,
[1:23:39] you know, the pressure of life to to
[1:23:41] engage in our the pressure on our time.
[1:23:44] There's no use even talking about it
[1:23:46] because everybody,
[1:23:47] &gt;&gt; I don't care where you live, how little
[1:23:50] you have or where you live and how much
[1:23:52] you have, you're all all subject to
[1:23:55] pressure.
[1:23:56] &gt;&gt; The same pressure. People who have a a a
[1:23:59] lot of responsibility are under
[1:24:01] incredible pressure. And those who
[1:24:04] should have no pressure, they still have
[1:24:06] a lot of responsibility. And and and
[1:24:08] they should have no pressure, but there
[1:24:10] is a lot of pressure. And I know that
[1:24:12] there is pressure. But on the other
[1:24:13] hand, God knows the pressure of this
[1:24:16] age.
[1:24:19] &gt;&gt; We do have soft living. You're going to
[1:24:21] go and and ride in a a a car that we
[1:24:24] trust it's a fine car and adequate to
[1:24:26] get you home and you're going to go
[1:24:28] someplace and eat and you're not going
[1:24:29] to be scraping for something to eat
[1:24:32] today. You know, we we have there seems
[1:24:35] to be plenty in this country. We throw
[1:24:37] away some nations would be delighted to
[1:24:40] live out of our garbage.
[1:24:43] Is it true?
[1:24:45] &gt;&gt; Am I preaching on target?
[1:24:48] &gt;&gt; That happens to be the It is the
[1:24:49] pressure of this age. We're not going to
[1:24:52] escape. You're not going to change the
[1:24:54] age.
[1:24:56] &gt;&gt; And I don't care where you are, what job
[1:25:00] you have, or where you live. You'll not
[1:25:02] escape the pressure.
[1:25:06] &gt;&gt; You say, "Well, that's terrible news,
[1:25:08] Brother Ed. you just might as well take
[1:25:10] it and settle it because that's what a
[1:25:13] prophet of God has said. You're not
[1:25:14] going to escape the pressure.
[1:25:18] &gt;&gt; Oh, you didn't want to hear that this
[1:25:20] morning,
[1:25:20] &gt;&gt; but that's what you are hearing. And you
[1:25:22] know what you should say? What this
[1:25:24] woman said? Truth.
[1:25:29] &gt;&gt; Not just a prophet of God said that. The
[1:25:32] Lord said that.
[1:25:33] &gt;&gt; Truth.
[1:25:35] Lord,
[1:25:37] &gt;&gt; this is an age of pressure.
[1:25:40] &gt;&gt; Truth. Lord, this is an age of soft
[1:25:42] living.
[1:25:43] &gt;&gt; Truth. Lord, this is an age of nervous
[1:25:46] tension. Truth, Lord.
[1:25:50] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:25:52] &gt;&gt; We're not going to escape it.
[1:25:56] &gt;&gt; Why does God
[1:25:58] allow us then to be in such a fix?
[1:26:02] because you have something within you
[1:26:06] that God wants developed.
[1:26:10] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:26:12] &gt;&gt; And the pressure is good for us. If we
[1:26:14] are believers, the pressure is good for
[1:26:17] us. The complex situation is good for
[1:26:20] us. These nervous tensions are good for
[1:26:22] us. This we have to say that whatever
[1:26:25] God allows is good for us. And I will
[1:26:27] not bow. I will not bend under it. I
[1:26:30] will not be broken under it. I don't
[1:26:33] have to have a bunch of medication to
[1:26:35] help me attend to it. I've got the
[1:26:37] source.
[1:26:38] [Applause]
[1:26:42] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:26:43] &gt;&gt; And I can render this thing not
[1:26:45] helpless, but I can render it in
[1:26:47] submission to the will of God in my
[1:26:51] life.
[1:26:52] &gt;&gt; It will bring about a positive, not a
[1:26:54] negative. It's not going to break me.
[1:26:57] It's going to make me.
[1:27:02] And you need a revelation to be able to
[1:27:04] identify what is being unfolded in your
[1:27:07] life that it's from God.
[1:27:11] &gt;&gt; Bring it on.
[1:27:12] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:27:13] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:27:14] &gt;&gt; You need a revelation
[1:27:16] that this is of God.
[1:27:18] &gt;&gt; What is happening and what is being
[1:27:20] unfolded out of my life? I can take you
[1:27:23] all through the scripture. I can take
[1:27:24] you to the centurion. I can take you to
[1:27:27] the to to the other woman. I can take
[1:27:29] you to the widow who who made the loaves
[1:27:32] for Elijah.
[1:27:34] All of those and the scripture is
[1:27:36] absolutely abundant with those
[1:27:39] situations.
[1:27:41] It was a crisis
[1:27:44] that brought out from the people.
[1:27:48] You know, there's a part of our lives
[1:27:53] that doesn't really require any
[1:27:55] revelation.
[1:27:57] doesn't require revelation to come here
[1:27:58] to church and sit here and doesn't even
[1:28:01] require revelation to say brother Bram
[1:28:04] says baptism in the name of the lord
[1:28:05] Jesus Christ doesn't even require
[1:28:06] revelation
[1:28:20] brother told a story
[1:28:23] I hope you have time
[1:28:26] &gt;&gt; I'm going take my time.
[1:28:29] &gt;&gt; Brother Bram told the story no less than
[1:28:31] 38 times.
[1:28:33] No less than 38 times. Told the same
[1:28:36] story
[1:28:37] of the young man slave from Africa who
[1:28:42] was brought over.
[1:28:44] And he told the story of the slave buyer
[1:28:46] coming to buy the slaves.
[1:28:50] And as he observed them,
[1:28:53] he saw one
[1:28:55] living acting very different from the
[1:28:58] others. Said, "I want him."
[1:29:02] So he's lived in certain he his his
[1:29:06] demeanor,
[1:29:08] his responses and his activity was such
[1:29:11] that this buyer wanted him. I want him.
[1:29:15] No, no. He said, "He's not for sale." He
[1:29:18] said, 'What makes him so different?
[1:29:21] And the owner said, 'Well, I wondered
[1:29:23] about that myself.
[1:29:26] I found out that he was the son of a
[1:29:29] king.
[1:29:31] His father is a king of a tribe across
[1:29:36] the seas.
[1:29:37] &gt;&gt; And because he sees that,
[1:29:42] because he knows that,
[1:29:45] &gt;&gt; he lives different.
[1:29:48] It was his knowledge of knowing.
[1:29:52] He knew that. He knew that he knew
[1:29:55] he's a son of a king.
[1:29:58] &gt;&gt; All of his circumstances around him was
[1:30:02] defying that, saying, "How can you be
[1:30:05] the son of a king when you're a slave?
[1:30:07] How can you be that when you're not
[1:30:09] there? How can you be that when you're
[1:30:11] across the ocean on another continent
[1:30:13] and you'll never get back? You'll never
[1:30:15] see it. you'll never become a king. But
[1:30:18] nevertheless, because he knew he was a
[1:30:20] king's son, he lived different.
[1:30:24] &gt;&gt; His matter, his department, his conduct,
[1:30:26] the way he the way he moved about,
[1:30:30] people saw he was different.
[1:30:34] &gt;&gt; So, a real revelation causes a person.
[1:30:38] I've been absolutely
[1:30:40] I've just been boggled in my mind how
[1:30:43] people will declare their revelation of
[1:30:46] the message and their revelation in the
[1:30:48] message and revelation and their life's
[1:30:50] a disaster.
[1:30:53] &gt;&gt; I'm talking about where they live
[1:30:55] personally victoriously. They don't live
[1:30:57] victoriously. I think I'd sooner have a
[1:31:00] person with a lot less revelation at
[1:31:02] least live up to it. Yeah.
[1:31:06] &gt;&gt; Live up to it.
[1:31:12] &gt;&gt; What makes him live different? He said
[1:31:14] he conducts himself that way. He knows
[1:31:17] he's a son of a king and he conducts
[1:31:20] himself that way.
[1:31:24] My summary of that is unless we know
[1:31:28] who we are,
[1:31:30] we will not live any different. If you
[1:31:34] know who you are,
[1:31:37] &gt;&gt; I mean, I'm talking about have a
[1:31:39] revelation of who you are,
[1:31:43] you will live different.
[1:31:47] Now, here's one.
[1:31:49] Here's something
[1:31:52] you that are here, you know, we talk
[1:31:54] about a prophet of God. You that are
[1:31:55] perhaps visiting, let me tell you, God
[1:31:58] sent a man with his word, God's word in
[1:32:01] his mouth.
[1:32:04] &gt;&gt; And here's what he said to you, to this
[1:32:07] generation, to this age, to those that
[1:32:10] would believe. And I'm speaking to you
[1:32:13] as believers today. And this message is
[1:32:16] in the the message the deity of Christ.
[1:32:20] I want you to listen. You're listening
[1:32:21] very nice.
[1:32:26] He said, "Let the fundamentalists,"
[1:32:27] that's there are many that are
[1:32:29] fundamental Christians. We're not
[1:32:30] talking about fundamentalists, but he
[1:32:32] said, "Let the fundamentalist, let them
[1:32:34] people who deny the power of God and say
[1:32:36] it's wrong." He says, "But that's the
[1:32:39] same power."
[1:32:41] Because he knew where he stood. Many
[1:32:43] times the prophet of God had to say, "I
[1:32:45] know where I'm standing."
[1:32:47] Really, what he's saying is that when he
[1:32:49] know where he's standing and he knows
[1:32:51] that the angel of the Lord is going to
[1:32:52] come and he knows that the secrets of
[1:32:54] the hearts are going to be revealed, he
[1:32:56] can say with confidence, I know where
[1:32:58] I'm standing. That also has a second
[1:33:00] part. Those who were coming up didn't
[1:33:04] know where they're standing.
[1:33:06] &gt;&gt; All the preachers sitting behind didn't
[1:33:09] know where they were standing. But here
[1:33:11] was one man who knew where he was
[1:33:13] standing. He knew what he was. He knew
[1:33:16] what he was called to do and he was
[1:33:18] moving in that direction.
[1:33:22] &gt;&gt; And here's what he said.
[1:33:25] But that same power that spoke the world
[1:33:28] into existence
[1:33:30] is in those people that's got the Holy
[1:33:34] Ghost. Not going to have you raise your
[1:33:37] hand. don't need you to identify
[1:33:39] yourself, but you ask yourself, do I
[1:33:43] have the Holy Ghost? And if your uh
[1:33:47] confession is confirmative,
[1:33:49] I know that I have the Holy Ghost. I
[1:33:53] have word for you. I have a thus sayeth
[1:33:55] the Lord. And the thus sayith the Lord
[1:33:57] says the same word, the same uh the same
[1:34:02] power that spoke the world into
[1:34:04] existence is in those people. that's got
[1:34:07] the Holy Ghost. And he said, "That's
[1:34:09] right."
[1:34:10] &gt;&gt; He addresses them, men and women.
[1:34:16] It's time that we find out who you are.
[1:34:21] &gt;&gt; The devil's trying to hide you back and
[1:34:25] tell you that you're some little trod
[1:34:28] down something. You're not.
[1:34:33] &gt;&gt; You're sons and daughters of God. That's
[1:34:36] thus sayaith the Lord. You're sons and
[1:34:38] daughters of God. Your sons and
[1:34:41] daughters of God. The deity is not in
[1:34:44] heaven. It's in you.
[1:34:48] &gt;&gt; Thus sayaith the Lord.
[1:34:50] &gt;&gt; Deity is not in heaven. It's in you.
[1:34:54] &gt;&gt; And God has allowed the pressures of
[1:34:57] this life. Has allowed you to come to
[1:34:59] this age. If he wanted you to be back in
[1:35:01] the inquisition, you'd have been there.
[1:35:03] It was God's choosing that you aren't
[1:35:05] there. It's God's choosing that you're
[1:35:08] here today. It's God's choosing that
[1:35:10] you'll be under this tension and you'll
[1:35:12] be under this pressure. It won't break
[1:35:14] you. It will make you.
[1:35:18] &gt;&gt; You do not need anti-depressants. You do
[1:35:21] not need some uppers. You do not need
[1:35:23] some downers. You do not need to be
[1:35:25] attended to. You need to submit to God.
[1:35:31] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And when the pressure comes,
[1:35:34] you want to look up and say, "Thank
[1:35:35] God."
[1:35:37] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. It's bringing something out
[1:35:39] of me that I didn't even know I
[1:35:41] possessed.
[1:35:45] &gt;&gt; I need a revelation from God so that I
[1:35:47] can identify and recognize what's coming
[1:35:50] out of me is God.
[1:35:53] &gt;&gt; This is God's plan.
[1:36:04] He said, "I know you think I'm crazy."
[1:36:07] After he said these words, he said, "I
[1:36:09] know you think I'm crazy." There was
[1:36:11] people back then that thought that was
[1:36:13] crazy. There may be some here this
[1:36:14] morning or some listening to me that
[1:36:15] think that this is over overboard.
[1:36:18] I say, "So, thus sayeth the Lord."
[1:36:21] &gt;&gt; And if you want to stumble around in
[1:36:23] your own reasoning, go your way. Think
[1:36:25] about it all you want. Turn it around,
[1:36:28] do whatever. You'll be in the same state
[1:36:30] that you're in today.
[1:36:33] &gt;&gt; I sooner go with God's thought.
[1:36:37] &gt;&gt; This is a way of victory.
[1:36:42] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:36:44] &gt;&gt; God prevent me. God save me from my own
[1:36:47] thinking.
[1:36:48] &gt;&gt; You need to say that.
[1:36:50] &gt;&gt; God saved me from my own reasoning. God
[1:36:53] saved me from my own thought. It hasn't
[1:36:55] got me anywhere anyhow.
[1:37:00] [Music]
[1:37:02] &gt;&gt; I know you think I'm crazy, but let me
[1:37:03] tell you something, brother.
[1:37:06] When you realize
[1:37:09] when realize
[1:37:11] and brother Brandham was standing here
[1:37:12] as God's servant said, "Let me tell you
[1:37:15] something, brother. Let me tell you
[1:37:18] something, sister. When you realize that
[1:37:21] almighty God lives in you,
[1:37:26] &gt;&gt; my life I give Zoe, the life of God is
[1:37:31] in the human being.
[1:37:35] &gt;&gt; And that is why Satan is so opposed.
[1:37:37] He'll do everything in the in the
[1:37:40] channels of the of the mind and in the
[1:37:42] channels of the of the realm of the
[1:37:44] spirit, the channels of your memory. Oh,
[1:37:48] how that wars. Oh, you need to say,
[1:37:51] "Cast that reasoning down. Cast those
[1:37:54] memories out. Holy Spirit, come now.
[1:37:57] Cleanse them out.
[1:37:58] [Music]
[1:38:00] &gt;&gt; Cleanse all these things out that have
[1:38:02] been as such a stumbling block to me,
[1:38:04] such a hindrance to me. All of these
[1:38:06] feelings and all this affection that's
[1:38:08] not of you. Cast it out."
[1:38:12] &gt;&gt; Why? So that God
[1:38:15] So that God can rise up. Hallelujah. So
[1:38:19] that God can be unfolded in you. And as
[1:38:22] you see God being unfolded in you, you
[1:38:24] need a revelation. That's God.
[1:38:31] &gt;&gt; How many people there are? many
[1:38:36] &gt;&gt; and the circumstances of life afforded
[1:38:38] them a certain opportunity and a door
[1:38:40] was open to them and they became they
[1:38:43] became very very well uh uh not merely
[1:38:46] educated but they became very competent
[1:38:48] in a certain field. They never knew
[1:38:50] that.
[1:38:54] They never knew that. They didn't know
[1:38:56] how many parents there are whose whose
[1:38:58] child came, you know, and and rose up
[1:39:02] amongst them right in their family and
[1:39:04] and began to blossom out in something
[1:39:06] and but certain circumstances, certain
[1:39:08] people, certain events had to happen.
[1:39:13] We all have experienced something like
[1:39:15] that.
[1:39:19] Linda plays the piano.
[1:39:25] I remember when her mother would sit and
[1:39:28] she's going through all of the finger
[1:39:30] exercises.
[1:39:31] Drove me crazy.
[1:39:34] And then she'd cry and and pound her
[1:39:38] knuckles.
[1:39:41] Oh, say, "Well, that was a delightful
[1:39:43] home."
[1:39:47] &gt;&gt; But my my wife is, as most of you know,
[1:39:50] she's very persistent.
[1:39:53] She just get one thing on her mind and
[1:39:55] there is no other direction. You're
[1:39:57] going to play the piano and that's all
[1:39:59] there is to it.
[1:40:02] So they all had to play the piano. And
[1:40:04] then Marilyn is coming up. She's playing
[1:40:06] the piano. Don't go and talk to Marilyn
[1:40:09] about if you have any question you come
[1:40:10] and talk to me.
[1:40:13] But the school contact us and said
[1:40:16] we want to talk to you about Maryland.
[1:40:19] So said, you know, we're having a
[1:40:22] problem
[1:40:24] and uh we don't know what the problem
[1:40:25] is. They said, you know, she has a
[1:40:28] problem and we think that you need to
[1:40:30] have her, you know, examined.
[1:40:33] So we took her to a specialist.
[1:40:37] He examined her. Oh, he said,
[1:40:42] uh, she's, uh, whatever, amidextrous,
[1:40:45] this, and that, the other thing. He said
[1:40:48] uh and they gave her eye test and giving
[1:40:51] hearing tests. I'm telling you this is
[1:40:53] before God tell you the absolute truth.
[1:40:55] Said she'll have hearing aids in both
[1:40:57] ears by the time she's 10 years old and
[1:41:00] she'll have to wear glasses and have
[1:41:02] hearing aids the rest of her life.
[1:41:06] We went to the little church there and
[1:41:08] mostly Newfoundland people in Toronto.
[1:41:12] We didn't know what more more to do.
[1:41:15] We we said this is impossible. What
[1:41:17] what's the matter? You know, she seems
[1:41:19] to be perfectly normal to us
[1:41:22] and uh uh took her up for prayer just
[1:41:26] like I brought my wife up Wednesday
[1:41:27] night and it was a Wednesday night and
[1:41:29] prayed for her. My wife then took her
[1:41:32] right back to the same hearing test to
[1:41:34] the same place to the same physician
[1:41:39] and her ears were perfect
[1:41:43] &gt;&gt; and her sight was perfect. Amen.
[1:41:45] &gt;&gt; And so we went we were advised to go to
[1:41:48] another specialist and this specialist
[1:41:50] he wired her with 22 wires in her head
[1:41:52] to give her brain waves. Oh man, you
[1:41:54] should have seen what that graph did.
[1:42:00] It just sent it right off the map.
[1:42:02] He said, "Oh," he said, "You know, are
[1:42:06] you she can't do things like with her.
[1:42:08] Are you trying to give her piano
[1:42:10] lessons?" "Yeah, of course we give her
[1:42:11] piano lessons." He said, "Forget it." He
[1:42:14] said, "She's, you know, and there are
[1:42:16] certain things that you, you know, she's
[1:42:19] not she's not fit for that. She's not
[1:42:22] suited to that. Her abilities aren't
[1:42:24] that. Her abilities are in another
[1:42:25] direction."
[1:42:27] And so, you know, he said, "You can't.
[1:42:31] She hasn't got this kind of coordination
[1:42:32] with her hand." Well, I said, "You know
[1:42:34] what? We notice that she does things
[1:42:36] with the left hand, does things see, I I
[1:42:38] even got it. she got it from me or I
[1:42:40] blame her for I blame her for a lot of
[1:42:42] things that I have. Maybe it worked in
[1:42:44] reverse.
[1:42:46] So I start talking about my left hand. I
[1:42:48] put out my right hand. But she does
[1:42:49] things with her left hand, cuts with her
[1:42:51] left hand, then does something with her
[1:42:52] right hand. And and uh and and now she,
[1:42:56] you know, we found that there were other
[1:42:59] abilities and she started her artwork as
[1:43:01] a very small child and then we found
[1:43:04] out, you know, she has gifts this way.
[1:43:08] Fact is she painted the picture of
[1:43:10] brother Brandham. Now here I am a
[1:43:11] parent. I I make a confession to you. I
[1:43:14] thought I had artists in different parts
[1:43:18] in the states and Canada both say that
[1:43:20] picture brother Brandham we would like
[1:43:22] your permission to paint it.
[1:43:26] And I had one letter from a brother and
[1:43:27] he wanted to paint it and he was ready
[1:43:29] to go ahead with painting it. And I
[1:43:30] thought
[1:43:32] you know what I have a daughter that's
[1:43:34] pretty good in art.
[1:43:36] I'd never made anything out of it. I
[1:43:39] thought, why don't I let her think about
[1:43:41] it? Why don't let her pray about it? And
[1:43:44] after some many, many, many weeks, in
[1:43:46] fact, as it was in months, since she
[1:43:48] prayed about it, and she'd like to now
[1:43:51] have the picture and look at it and that
[1:43:53] now we have the many of you have the
[1:43:54] picture. But I can tell you that when
[1:43:58] she had 22 wires in her head, I had no
[1:44:01] idea she'd ever paint a picture.
[1:44:07] You know, you're sitting here and I'm
[1:44:10] telling you on the authority of God's
[1:44:12] word, you do not know what's in you and
[1:44:16] you do not know yet what you will do.
[1:44:19] And you may be going through some
[1:44:21] grinding experience at this moment
[1:44:25] and you don't realize that that's God.
[1:44:28] You think, "Oh, it's this and it's my
[1:44:31] job and it's my home situation and it's
[1:44:34] my in my school. It's my education. It's
[1:44:38] where I work. It's something ah I just
[1:44:40] can't stand it." And God is saying,
[1:44:43] "Good. Just cook.
[1:44:46] Just let the heat let that heat develop
[1:44:50] what I want to see develop." And
[1:44:52] finally, you know, a person cries out
[1:44:54] and finds out, "Oh, Lord." And and even
[1:44:56] she said the wrong thing. Oh thou son of
[1:45:00] David have mercy. Get away from me. And
[1:45:04] you cry out and the heavens are brass.
[1:45:08] How many here I will ask for a show of
[1:45:09] hands. How many here have ever prayed
[1:45:11] and felt that the heavens were brass.
[1:45:15] &gt;&gt; Oh lot of brass heavens.
[1:45:18] &gt;&gt; There was no answer. Don't give up.
[1:45:22] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Just say it a different way.
[1:45:24] Amen.
[1:45:25] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:45:25] &gt;&gt; And if you can't say anything else, say,
[1:45:27] "Lord,
[1:45:29] &gt;&gt; help me,
[1:45:32] &gt;&gt; Lord. Just help me.
[1:45:34] &gt;&gt; I can't sort it out. I can't figure it
[1:45:36] out. I can't find my way.
[1:45:39] I know you led me here. I know you have
[1:45:44] the answer. Help me.
[1:45:48] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:45:49] &gt;&gt; Tell you what, friends, I feel more than
[1:45:51] inspired. I know this is God's word and
[1:45:54] God's message for this service this
[1:45:56] morning. And whoever is here, I know
[1:45:58] it's for you, young and old alike. And I
[1:46:00] felt it's going to be a very, very
[1:46:02] special milestone message for some of
[1:46:04] you.
[1:46:11] &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham says about believing in
[1:46:13] God. I said earlier, now I'm going to
[1:46:15] give some quotes to quickly back it up.
[1:46:18] He says America. When we found the
[1:46:19] American Indian, he was worshiping
[1:46:22] something. The sun, the moon, the
[1:46:23] nature. Because in him, he's got a human
[1:46:26] spirit. He's a human being. And he knows
[1:46:28] he had a maker. So, there was something
[1:46:31] within the human heart called out to
[1:46:33] worship. See, that didn't take any
[1:46:35] revelation. Doesn't take any revelation
[1:46:38] to walk out and see, oh, the great
[1:46:41] universe and say, "Isn't this
[1:46:43] marvelous?"
[1:46:44] doesn't take a revelation for the
[1:46:46] scripture even says about about the
[1:46:49] unbeliever. Paul in the Romans said
[1:46:52] because that which may be known of God
[1:46:55] listen closely that which may be known
[1:46:58] of God is manifest in them. For God hath
[1:47:03] showed it unto them. For the invisible
[1:47:06] things of him, the invisible things of
[1:47:10] him of God from the creation of the
[1:47:13] world are clearly seen
[1:47:16] being understood by the things that are
[1:47:18] made. People look at flowers, they look
[1:47:20] at trees, they look at nature, they look
[1:47:23] at the salmon returning home, they we
[1:47:25] look at all of these things and said,
[1:47:27] "This is of God. This is God." There's
[1:47:29] no revelation.
[1:47:31] &gt;&gt; You understand? That doesn't take any
[1:47:33] revelation.
[1:47:35] That's why Muslims can believe in God.
[1:47:37] Sikhs believe in God. Untold billions of
[1:47:40] people believe in God. There's God
[1:47:42] someplace. There's God somewhere and
[1:47:44] there's something in them. They want to
[1:47:45] worship something.
[1:47:47] &gt;&gt; It's no revelation.
[1:47:51] Until you can identify what God has
[1:47:54] sent,
[1:47:57] &gt;&gt; what can we do to do the works of God?
[1:48:00] Believe on him
[1:48:02] &gt;&gt; whom God has sent.
[1:48:04] I'm standing behind the pulpit today
[1:48:08] and you have a right to say what brought
[1:48:11] you here.
[1:48:13] What caused you? How come you're a
[1:48:15] pastor? How come you're a preacher? You
[1:48:18] have a right to say that. And then it's
[1:48:20] incumbent upon you to go back and find
[1:48:23] out how come this is this way. And then
[1:48:26] you answer yourself, why am I here?
[1:48:29] &gt;&gt; Why am I listening? What brought me
[1:48:31] here? What is the trajectory? What
[1:48:33] influenced me? Who spoke to me? Say,
[1:48:36] "Well, a brother spoke to me." But deep
[1:48:38] down you say, "No, God spoke to me. God
[1:48:40] revealed it to me. I may not have a lot
[1:48:43] of revelation, but I know one thing.
[1:48:45] This word is true.
[1:48:46] &gt;&gt; I know one thing." Hallelujah.
[1:48:49] &gt;&gt; This word is true. See, and then it it
[1:48:52] took it took some forces, powerful
[1:48:54] forces to bring that out of you and
[1:48:56] bring you to where you are today.
[1:49:00] Praise God.
[1:49:02] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:49:03] &gt;&gt; I was looking down here at Brother Roger
[1:49:04] Monk and his father. I'm sure they I
[1:49:08] know them well enough to know they won't
[1:49:10] be offended with what I say. But Rogers,
[1:49:12] he was a he's an engineer, sound
[1:49:15] engineer for the girls records and he's
[1:49:18] got a very very fine studio downtown and
[1:49:21] it's probably one of the best engineers
[1:49:23] that I know uh period all the way up and
[1:49:26] down the west coast or in Western
[1:49:28] Canada. But I'm sure that
[1:49:31] when
[1:49:33] Mr. Monk senior
[1:49:35] had him as a boy,
[1:49:38] didn't realize that was in him.
[1:49:41] Didn't realize at all. One day he would
[1:49:43] sit and I I can just tell you I thought
[1:49:46] I have a fairly good ear for music and
[1:49:49] the girls will be singing and I've never
[1:49:52] seen Roger play a piano. I've never seen
[1:49:54] him I've never seen him tune an
[1:49:56] instrument. Never seen him play an
[1:49:57] instrument. I don't know if he does play
[1:49:59] an instrument. I know one thing. And
[1:50:00] then these boards to me is just a whole
[1:50:02] bunch of buttons and wires and stuff.
[1:50:05] And he says that this board thing must
[1:50:07] be 15 foot long and he's on a stool that
[1:50:11] rolls around, you know, back and forth.
[1:50:12] And he's doing this, doing that. And he
[1:50:14] just clicks a button in the and he
[1:50:16] speaks in the in a in the room where the
[1:50:18] girls are singing. He says, uh, he calls
[1:50:22] one of the girls name. I believe one
[1:50:23] time he said Joanne uh just we'll just
[1:50:26] start singing again cuz just a a a touch
[1:50:29] that uh right when you started that last
[1:50:32] line just you know sing that one again
[1:50:34] and then you know just when they get
[1:50:36] there and they start singing it again
[1:50:38] and then he slides it up and and then
[1:50:40] and the new line comes in he says you
[1:50:42] got it this time and I sat there and
[1:50:44] thought what in the world does he know
[1:50:45] about music? He he I see him working
[1:50:48] this board, but then when you hear the
[1:50:50] song, the pitch is just absolutely
[1:50:53] correct.
[1:50:54] &gt;&gt; And I'm sure that uh Mr. Monk Senior
[1:50:58] never realized, you know, one day when
[1:51:00] his his boy grows up, he's going to have
[1:51:03] that kind of an ear, but it was
[1:51:04] something in him. And then and then
[1:51:06] that's developed over over the years.
[1:51:08] You you you develop those things. Now,
[1:51:12] spiritually, Brother Brandham says,
[1:51:15] "See, I'm not I'm not I'm not home yet.
[1:51:18] I'm not finished yet."
[1:51:22] Are you ready?
[1:51:25] &gt;&gt; Brother Bram says, "Dity is in the
[1:51:27] human."
[1:51:29] Now, that's rejected by the world.
[1:51:34] &gt;&gt; But they would have to also reject the
[1:51:35] words of Jesus Christ that says, "I will
[1:51:39] be in you.
[1:51:42] I will be in the Father and the Father
[1:51:44] will be in me and I will be in you
[1:51:47] &gt;&gt; and you will be in me.
[1:51:49] &gt;&gt; Are we settled with that?
[1:51:51] &gt;&gt; Okay. There's a lot of our
[1:51:54] uh uh uh I'm I'm going to address
[1:51:56] something.
[1:51:59] There's a lot of our life just our our
[1:52:02] our natural being that
[1:52:06] we each have our difficulty with.
[1:52:11] And others have difficulty with it or
[1:52:14] they might have a difficulty with
[1:52:15] another part. When you're in a body of
[1:52:17] pe believers like this, you know, there
[1:52:20] are some that you just really really uh
[1:52:24] what should I say? You just have such
[1:52:26] harmony with. And then others you don't
[1:52:28] have the same kind of harmony. And some
[1:52:30] may rub you the wrong way.
[1:52:33] Hear me? That may be the very person God
[1:52:35] sent your direction.
[1:52:37] Right. True.
[1:52:39] &gt;&gt; And you cozy up to all those that's real
[1:52:42] nice for you. I'm feel so comfortable
[1:52:44] and this is these are people I like to
[1:52:46] be with and you know we do we have a
[1:52:48] good there's no personality conflicts
[1:52:50] etc etc. But maybe it's the personality
[1:52:52] conflict God sent you and you you wonder
[1:52:55] how come we're still in the same church
[1:52:58] &gt;&gt; and God needs you in the church and God
[1:53:00] needs the other person in the church
[1:53:02] because and and we we hear little things
[1:53:05] about you know we've heard things that
[1:53:06] well we maybe need you know they're
[1:53:08] shining you up we kind of need to great
[1:53:10] I'm going to take it a whole lot deeper
[1:53:11] you need that person you need that kind
[1:53:13] of pressure you need this kind of
[1:53:15] association to bring something of God
[1:53:17] out of your life
[1:53:20] &gt;&gt; and you start finding that you have a
[1:53:22] patience and you have an understanding
[1:53:24] and you have there's something of Christ
[1:53:26] coming out and you have an appreciation.
[1:53:28] You have a respect.
[1:53:31] &gt;&gt; I have something a word for you. Maybe
[1:53:32] you're having a revelation.
[1:53:36] &gt;&gt; There's actually God coming out of my
[1:53:38] life. God is developing some maturity in
[1:53:40] my life.
[1:53:42] &gt;&gt; Where I used to have a problem before
[1:53:44] with this person. I don't have it
[1:53:45] anymore. Fact is, I kind of like that
[1:53:48] person. And just keep keep on that same
[1:53:51] direction. You'll finally have love for
[1:53:52] them.
[1:53:56] &gt;&gt; This service won't be complete till some
[1:53:58] people who have never hugged the next
[1:54:01] person need to embrace them this
[1:54:03] morning.
[1:54:07] &gt;&gt; Well, I had a good amen from some
[1:54:08] quarters, but not from other quarters.
[1:54:11] You need to actually embrace them and
[1:54:13] say, "Thank God for your life. You're
[1:54:15] just what I need.
[1:54:17] &gt;&gt; After this service, the other person
[1:54:19] might say, "Just what did you mean by
[1:54:21] that?"
[1:54:26] You see now in the Old Testament
[1:54:30] and and this this is just so well known
[1:54:32] to everybody in the message. We know
[1:54:34] that and Jesus told that how the
[1:54:37] prophets and the holy men and the
[1:54:39] righteous of ages gone by, they were
[1:54:41] rejected.
[1:54:44] They were rejected.
[1:54:46] &gt;&gt; Why were they rejected? Well, because
[1:54:48] their their message, their life,
[1:54:50] everything about them irritated the
[1:54:53] people around them.
[1:54:55] &gt;&gt; And little did they know that that was
[1:54:57] the very thing they needed.
[1:55:01] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[1:55:03] &gt;&gt; And it was that that that part that we
[1:55:05] want to write off as maybe personality
[1:55:08] conflict or they got something that I
[1:55:10] just, you know, have a difficulty with
[1:55:12] whatever more. Uh that's the very thing
[1:55:14] that you need to just say, "God, I know
[1:55:17] one thing. You sent me here. I know
[1:55:19] another thing. You've allowed that
[1:55:21] person into my life. And so I know
[1:55:23] another thing that you're working out
[1:55:25] something and I'm going to get the
[1:55:26] benefit from it."
[1:55:30] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[1:55:38] &gt;&gt; I just going to go through this.
[1:55:41] Jesus said, "Woe to you scribes and
[1:55:44] Pharisees, hypocrites, because you build
[1:55:47] the tombs of the prophets and garnish
[1:55:49] the sepelers of the righteous." And when
[1:55:51] the prophets of God and the righteous
[1:55:54] when the prophets of God and the
[1:55:55] righteous were manifesting the anointed
[1:55:58] word in their lifetime, notice when they
[1:56:01] were manifesting the word of God in
[1:56:03] their lifetime. I don't want to lose
[1:56:04] you. Now I'm come to some of the most
[1:56:06] important point here. When they
[1:56:08] manifested the word of God in their
[1:56:10] lifetime, the holy men, the righteous,
[1:56:12] the prophets of old, when they
[1:56:13] manifested the life of God,
[1:56:16] that was why they were despised.
[1:56:20] But they had to have a revelation that
[1:56:23] that which they were speaking, that
[1:56:25] which they were living was actually God
[1:56:29] unfolding out of them. And that's why
[1:56:32] brother Brandham could say these words.
[1:56:34] So I'll just clinch that. He said, "It's
[1:56:37] not me they hate,
[1:56:40] &gt;&gt; it's the message.
[1:56:45] It's not me
[1:56:48] that is the irritant.
[1:56:51] It's what you speak
[1:56:54] &gt;&gt; or what you live,
[1:56:57] &gt;&gt; your actions
[1:57:01] that can become a real irritant
[1:57:04] just the way you are. And and so
[1:57:06] consequently,
[1:57:08] it might even be the place a person
[1:57:10] works or the place a person studies.
[1:57:14] And you're the oddball, but you don't
[1:57:16] know why you're the oddball. Well, let
[1:57:19] it be known. I'm telling you why you're
[1:57:20] the oddball. Because the spirit that's
[1:57:22] in you is of a different spirit.
[1:57:27] &gt;&gt; Oh my. God, help me. And God help you at
[1:57:29] this moment.
[1:57:30] [Music]
[1:57:33] God has not sent you to this world to be
[1:57:38] a businessman,
[1:57:41] &gt;&gt; to be an accountant,
[1:57:44] &gt;&gt; to be an engineer,
[1:57:46] &gt;&gt; to be a bus driver,
[1:57:48] &gt;&gt; or to be a policeman,
[1:57:50] &gt;&gt; or whatever other occupation you may.
[1:57:53] That's not why God sent you here. God
[1:57:56] sent you here to be his son
[1:57:59] &gt;&gt; and to be his daughter and to have deity
[1:58:02] living in you. That's why God sent you.
[1:58:06] &gt;&gt; And this other is just to accommodate to
[1:58:08] get us through life. Amen.
[1:58:16] &gt;&gt; Now, if what if what we do
[1:58:20] in life, I work at a certain job or I
[1:58:23] have a certain occupation or or whatever
[1:58:26] it is that I do. If that begins to
[1:58:28] compromise
[1:58:30] your spiritual experience, your
[1:58:32] spiritual life, then you need to you
[1:58:36] need to do something about it.
[1:58:40] quite frankly
[1:58:42] and it's what I believe and you can you
[1:58:43] can do what you want with it but quite
[1:58:45] frankly I believe if a if a man a wife
[1:58:48] has family has children
[1:58:52] and you stay away from the house of God
[1:58:57] don't think for a minute that I am
[1:59:00] putting pressure on people to be here in
[1:59:02] church you need church a whole lot more
[1:59:05] than I need you to be here
[1:59:08] what you're really saying. How many here
[1:59:10] will actually confess with me and
[1:59:12] believe with me that we preach a message
[1:59:14] with our actions?
[1:59:17] &gt;&gt; Believe that.
[1:59:18] &gt;&gt; You don't have to say a word. You're
[1:59:20] just preaching with your actions.
[1:59:23] &gt;&gt; And so I just become laxidasical or I
[1:59:26] become disinterested or or I become too
[1:59:29] busy or I become whatever. I don't care
[1:59:31] what it is, but your actions and say,
[1:59:34] "Well, I haven't I haven't got the time.
[1:59:36] I I got too much pressure. I've got this
[1:59:39] and I've got that and I can't be this. I
[1:59:42] can't take my place in the body of
[1:59:44] Christ. I can't be there for these
[1:59:46] services. I can't be there. I can't
[1:59:48] participate in these things. What you're
[1:59:51] doing is you are preaching a message
[1:59:54] &gt;&gt; to your children that what I'm doing
[1:59:57] here at home is more important than the
[2:00:00] word of God that's going over the
[2:00:01] pullpit. What I'm doing and and the
[2:00:03] children, you don't have they don't have
[2:00:05] to say, "Amen, Dad. We believe that.
[2:00:07] Amen, Mom." They don't have to say that.
[2:00:09] You're preaching them a message and
[2:00:11] they're getting it.
[2:00:12] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[2:00:13] &gt;&gt; And they grow up. And you know what?
[2:00:15] When they grow up, church isn't
[2:00:17] important anymore.
[2:00:19] The meetings aren't important.
[2:00:21] &gt;&gt; The word of God's not important. What
[2:00:23] you're really saying is that the man
[2:00:25] that laid on his face and spent those
[2:00:27] hours waiting on God for a word from God
[2:00:30] for your family, for your children, for
[2:00:32] you young men, you young ladies, and all
[2:00:34] who are here. What you're really saying
[2:00:36] is that's not as important as what I'm
[2:00:39] doing and occupied with for my little
[2:00:41] life.
[2:00:46] &gt;&gt; That's really what you're saying. And
[2:00:48] they're getting that message.
[2:00:50] &gt;&gt; They're absolutely getting that message.
[2:00:52] I heard some statistics. I don't have it
[2:00:54] so I'll not attempt to give it to you
[2:00:56] but I heard of some statistics of the
[2:00:59] number of young people and children that
[2:01:02] grow up into adulthood and take a
[2:01:05] responsible place in the community and
[2:01:08] in the house of God and in the work of
[2:01:10] Christ that have come from
[2:01:14] united homes that have come from broken
[2:01:18] homes that have come from homes that are
[2:01:22] broken and the children stayed with the
[2:01:24] mother or homes that are broken and
[2:01:26] children stayed with the father and it's
[2:01:28] absolutely astounding. These are
[2:01:30] national figures in the United States.
[2:01:33] It was absolutely astounding
[2:01:35] the the the figures on on that account
[2:01:39] and how critical and how important it
[2:01:42] was that the children even though it is
[2:01:44] from a broken home that they continue to
[2:01:47] go to church and continue to be in the
[2:01:49] house of God.
[2:01:51] There's nothing saying there's no
[2:01:53] there's no responsibility that God has
[2:01:55] to give you some great blessing every
[2:01:57] time. Listen to me.
[2:02:01] &gt;&gt; I'm not merely preaching to you. I'm
[2:02:03] telling you my wife is from a broken
[2:02:04] home
[2:02:06] &gt;&gt; from about 11 12 years old
[2:02:10] and stayed with her daddy
[2:02:13] and lived across the street. Her daddy's
[2:02:15] business was across the street from the
[2:02:16] church. And so she was constantly in the
[2:02:19] church because she was with the young
[2:02:20] people and started playing the piano
[2:02:22] when she was just a girl about 14 years
[2:02:24] old. And the preacher would be on
[2:02:26] knocking on her door like at 7 in the
[2:02:28] morning because they had a live radio
[2:02:31] broadcast, just a simple live radio
[2:02:33] broadcast. She'd go with the preacher
[2:02:35] and she'd play something on the radio
[2:02:36] and the piano. And do you think that
[2:02:38] every morning she got up just clicking
[2:02:40] her heels, oh isn't this wonderful? I'm
[2:02:42] just glad I can get up at 7:00 and go to
[2:02:44] the radio station. No, this was a drag.
[2:02:48] It was just a responsibility.
[2:02:52] &gt;&gt; And a lot of you young people, you got
[2:02:53] your mothers and you got your fathers.
[2:02:55] You wouldn't want to have had my life
[2:02:58] either. I lived a very, very lonely
[2:03:00] life.
[2:03:04] And as you know, my mom passed away when
[2:03:06] I was six and a half.
[2:03:08] And I boarded out to a place that had no
[2:03:11] children, lived in a little log house,
[2:03:14] little log house. And I remember well
[2:03:17] walking through the just walking through
[2:03:19] the trees and I'd hear the partridge
[2:03:22] flutter their wings and I'd kick the
[2:03:24] grass and they sent me go and get the
[2:03:27] cow every day. Have to go and get the
[2:03:29] cow.
[2:03:31] You have to forgive me. I thought this
[2:03:32] old stupid cow
[2:03:36] bring it in and tie it up in the same
[2:03:38] old barn all the time. And you think I
[2:03:41] was clicking my heels over that? I
[2:03:43] didn't have my sister or she shot sent
[2:03:45] off to some place and I'm sent off to
[2:03:47] another place and never got to see him.
[2:03:49] Month in, month out, month in, month
[2:03:51] out.
[2:03:53] When I got older,
[2:03:56] you think I I thought I thought to
[2:03:58] myself when I got older, I thought I can
[2:04:00] do two things.
[2:04:03] I could come into meetings, I'd be in
[2:04:04] the house of God, and I'd hear the word
[2:04:06] of God, and I'd feel the presence of
[2:04:08] God.
[2:04:10] And I I just felt like I wanted to I
[2:04:12] wanted to I wanted to bend in that
[2:04:14] direction. And I was very aware that I
[2:04:17] could get bitter.
[2:04:20] Get bitter. Why? Why do I have to be
[2:04:23] stripped of this?
[2:04:25] Why do I have to be out here? Why do I
[2:04:26] have to be boarded out with people?
[2:04:31] Boarded in one home. And the woman was
[2:04:33] stone blind.
[2:04:36] Stone blind.
[2:04:40] And uh the bathrooms outside outside
[2:04:43] toilet with a wire so she could find her
[2:04:46] way out there. She was the one that
[2:04:48] cooked for me.
[2:04:52] Poorer than church mice.
[2:04:55] Pancakes every morning
[2:04:58] not cooked in the middle with only
[2:05:00] molasses to pour on them.
[2:05:06] Don't talk to me about life.
[2:05:08] Don't talk to me about hardship. Don't
[2:05:11] talk to me about loneliness.
[2:05:14] Don't talk to me about that. I've been
[2:05:16] there.
[2:05:17] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:05:18] &gt;&gt; I've been there, done that. Not a month,
[2:05:21] not four months, not six months, not a
[2:05:24] year is most of my life till at 15
[2:05:27] leaving home
[2:05:30] and starting to work on your own
[2:05:33] at 15 years old.
[2:05:38] I'm looking at you.
[2:05:41] I'm saying I have a memory channel, too.
[2:05:45] Praise God.
[2:05:47] &gt;&gt; And I look I let the Holy Spirit blast
[2:05:50] that out clear.
[2:05:53] &gt;&gt; And I look up and say, "Oh God,
[2:05:56] whatever happened, you ordained it.
[2:06:00] &gt;&gt; I know one thing. Godly led me here. You
[2:06:03] led me to this truth. You led me to this
[2:06:06] word. And you led these people to be
[2:06:08] here. And we need one another. I need
[2:06:10] them. They need me. I'm going to love
[2:06:12] them." Amen.
[2:06:14] &gt;&gt; You know, I haven't found that a chore.
[2:06:17] &gt;&gt; Quite honestly, I don't have enough time
[2:06:19] with you.
[2:06:20] &gt;&gt; I dream in my mind of having all the
[2:06:22] Hutterite people over, all his family
[2:06:24] over, all the young people over,
[2:06:27] everything else. Brother John Andy's had
[2:06:29] all the young people over. Told him,
[2:06:30] "Oh, we had all these young people
[2:06:31] over." You know what I did? I envied
[2:06:33] him.
[2:06:35] &gt;&gt; I looked at my yard, Brother John, just
[2:06:37] yesterday, the day before. I thought,
[2:06:40] "Wouldn't it be wonderful have all the
[2:06:41] young people over here?" they could do
[2:06:43] some things and just to have them here
[2:06:45] in the house. We don't get enough of
[2:06:46] each other. And I believe that that is
[2:06:48] the spirit that's going to cause us that
[2:06:51] I have I have a revelation that that's
[2:06:53] from God.
[2:06:54] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:06:55] &gt;&gt; And we don't have enough of each other
[2:06:57] down here.
[2:06:59] &gt;&gt; We want to be together.
[2:07:01] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:07:01] &gt;&gt; I don't have any trouble thinking I'm
[2:07:03] going to sit across the table from you
[2:07:06] at the great wedding supper. I don't
[2:07:08] have any trouble. I don't have to
[2:07:09] imagine that. I just think about it. And
[2:07:11] it's a reality to me. We're going to sit
[2:07:13] around the table. We're going to enjoy
[2:07:15] one another.
[2:07:17] &gt;&gt; When we get invited, as we were just
[2:07:19] yesterday, I I couldn't hardly I I even
[2:07:22] though it's a study day for me,
[2:07:23] Saturdays, I'm studying, I think that I
[2:07:25] want to be there. I want to be with the
[2:07:27] saints. I want to be with them. I want
[2:07:29] to share some things. I want them to
[2:07:30] share some things.
[2:07:35] I'm not done.
[2:07:38] Then there's folks there's some young
[2:07:40] people we married them
[2:07:43] maybe months or years or whatever more
[2:07:46] and we were a service to them. They got
[2:07:48] married. They're not here today.
[2:07:50] &gt;&gt; They're maybe not even in sin. They're
[2:07:53] just not here.
[2:08:01] We were of service to them. When they
[2:08:04] wanted us, we had to be there. Then when
[2:08:07] they don't need us, they're gone. We're
[2:08:09] history. But then when they get in
[2:08:11] trouble, they're on the phone cuz you're
[2:08:13] our pastor and that's our church. We are
[2:08:18] &gt;&gt; telling to me again.
[2:08:21] &gt;&gt; And then somebody somebody passed away.
[2:08:24] Somebody died. And it's like, "Brother
[2:08:26] Ed, put them in heaven."
[2:08:29] Well, you didn't even want to be with
[2:08:30] the saints down here.
[2:08:32] &gt;&gt; You didn't even want to gather with the
[2:08:33] saints down. You didn't want to be with
[2:08:35] the bride down here. How come you want
[2:08:36] to be with him over there?
[2:08:38] &gt;&gt; Do you get my message?
[2:08:40] &gt;&gt; Come on. Here we go.
[2:08:42] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:08:43] &gt;&gt; And for those of you that it's been a
[2:08:45] burden and you had a struggle and you
[2:08:48] have that border and you have this long
[2:08:51] drive from Chilowak or wherever more and
[2:08:53] you have all of these things so that you
[2:08:56] could worship and you come from
[2:08:57] Mary'sville, you folks and I never ever
[2:09:00] every time I drive through there. drove
[2:09:02] through just a about a week and a half
[2:09:04] ago and thought of our dear friends from
[2:09:06] Mary'sville and I said to my wife, "We
[2:09:09] ought to stop and see them." And well,
[2:09:10] on the spur of the moment like this, we
[2:09:12] didn't know just when we'd be there and
[2:09:13] we thought better better just carry on.
[2:09:19] People pay a sacrifice. Come here to the
[2:09:21] house of God. You think God doesn't see
[2:09:24] that? He sees that sacrifice. He knows
[2:09:26] what you go through.
[2:09:29] Amen.
[2:09:33] &gt;&gt; And I feel as though,
[2:09:36] you know, don't ask me to put you in
[2:09:39] heaven
[2:09:41] with the bride of Jesus Christ if you
[2:09:44] didn't want to be with them down here.
[2:09:46] &gt;&gt; Use every excuse to get away from them.
[2:09:48] Be away from them. Be too busy from
[2:09:50] them. Preach a message to your children.
[2:09:52] It's not worth it. We don't care how
[2:09:54] much they prayed. We don't care what's
[2:09:55] going on. We don't care what's preached.
[2:09:57] It's better if we stay at home. look at
[2:09:59] a video or do something else.
[2:10:01] &gt;&gt; You preach them a message
[2:10:03] &gt;&gt; and God should convict you over that
[2:10:06] &gt;&gt; at this moment.
[2:10:07] &gt;&gt; Is that right?
[2:10:08] &gt;&gt; Let this congregation at least support
[2:10:10] me. Those things are the truth.
[2:10:13] &gt;&gt; And you need to turn around from that.
[2:10:15] You need to say, "I'm going to take my
[2:10:16] life serious. I'm going to take my walk
[2:10:18] with God serious. Whatever do I'm going
[2:10:21] to lay my life down in a full surrender
[2:10:23] to Christ. I'm going to be an example to
[2:10:25] the people. I'm going to be there to
[2:10:27] shake hands with somebody, to give them
[2:10:29] an encouraging word, and to be my part
[2:10:31] in the body of Christ.
[2:10:32] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:10:39] &gt;&gt; I'm closing
[2:10:48] life.
[2:10:50] The life that you have, the life that
[2:10:53] you're living
[2:10:56] will continue to be
[2:10:59] a life of self-discovery.
[2:11:02] And I want to say to this congregation
[2:11:04] today, I go to the words of God's
[2:11:06] prophet,
[2:11:08] you have deity
[2:11:11] in you. And Satan works at full time 247
[2:11:19] to work through this flesh to twist and
[2:11:22] pervert that life that's in you or to
[2:11:25] keep it down to keep it suppressed.
[2:11:28] &gt;&gt; But if you have a revelation, I can't
[2:11:30] give you this revelation, but if you
[2:11:31] have a revelation, you're a daughter or
[2:11:34] son of God, then be it known to you. Be
[2:11:38] it known to you, not my words, prophet
[2:11:41] of God's words. You have deity in you
[2:11:44] and God is going to bring it out.
[2:11:46] &gt;&gt; He's going to do it one way or another.
[2:11:49] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:11:52] &gt;&gt; I have a very very well-known rock band
[2:11:57] artist
[2:11:59] that lives across the street from me and
[2:12:02] they were having big big parties
[2:12:05] some time ago, some years ago. The
[2:12:07] church prayed and and we had to take
[2:12:10] some steps to have them stop because
[2:12:13] they were going all night. One more
[2:12:15] night till 7:00 Sunday morning, then
[2:12:16] expect me to come here and preach. I
[2:12:18] said, "You have your party all you want,
[2:12:20] but 11:00 it shut down." That's what the
[2:12:23] bylaw says
[2:12:26] and they struggled with that. finally
[2:12:30] it was shut down and things happened and
[2:12:33] and uh so we've had very very little
[2:12:35] communication just you know maybe
[2:12:36] acknowledge one another whatever more
[2:12:39] and but we we've we've lived across the
[2:12:42] street from each other for 17 years so I
[2:12:45] know him very very well
[2:12:48] yesterday I was mowing the day before
[2:12:50] yesterday I was mowing the lawn and he
[2:12:53] came and stood right at my curb
[2:12:56] and just waited and I caught him in the
[2:12:58] corner of my eye. So I I just shut my I
[2:13:03] shut my machine off and walked back to
[2:13:04] him.
[2:13:06] Hi Robbie, how are you? We shook hands.
[2:13:10] Think you know who I'm speaking about.
[2:13:13] And he was he was dead serious.
[2:13:17] And he thrust out his hand and took my
[2:13:19] hand, shook it. He said, "Uh, that that
[2:13:24] that service, your your congregation,
[2:13:27] the people, that service you had for
[2:13:29] that O'Brien boy." I said, "Yeah."
[2:13:33] He said, "I was so impressed." He said,
[2:13:36] "The the the" and he was trying to
[2:13:38] describe the atmosphere and he and he
[2:13:40] began to describe the congregation. He
[2:13:42] says, "How the people how the how the
[2:13:44] congregation pulled together and the
[2:13:46] kind of service, the kind of time they
[2:13:47] had." and he put his hands together like
[2:13:49] this and and and and and the strength
[2:13:53] that the strength of the people and he
[2:13:55] was trying to express it and then I
[2:13:57] begin to talk to him begin to tell him
[2:13:59] of other things and tell him about the
[2:14:01] media and tell them about other things
[2:14:03] how how God had used it in different
[2:14:05] ways. He was so affected and I got to
[2:14:09] thinking, you know, here's this here
[2:14:12] here's such a tragedy that took place
[2:14:14] and so many have have suffered and
[2:14:17] agonized as a result of it. But be it
[2:14:19] known, God also knew this. God knew it's
[2:14:23] going to touch some heart weeks, months
[2:14:25] later, still continues to touch some
[2:14:28] heart. But I was thankful I can stand
[2:14:30] there and say through it all, through it
[2:14:33] all, we've just lived lived the life of
[2:14:36] Christ in front of them. That's the
[2:14:38] testimony that we want. That's the
[2:14:39] testimonies as a church we want. I don't
[2:14:41] care what other believers churches even
[2:14:43] do.
[2:14:44] &gt;&gt; I'm concerned what this one does.
[2:14:46] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:14:47] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:14:48] &gt;&gt; And whatever reaction that we ever have,
[2:14:50] whatever we ever display from this
[2:14:52] church, from this congregation, from you
[2:14:54] as individuals, we want to make sure
[2:14:55] it's the spirit of Christ. Amen.
[2:14:58] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen?
[2:15:00] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:15:01] &gt;&gt; I trust you've been blessed with the
[2:15:03] word. I trust that it's a
[2:15:06] &gt;&gt; through it all.
[2:15:09] &gt;&gt; I've come to trust in Jesus.
[2:15:12] Hallelujah.
[2:15:14] Is it okay, friends?
[2:15:16] &gt;&gt; I spoke out of my heart this morning,
[2:15:19] &gt;&gt; and I never quite get done, but I think
[2:15:21] that you see where I'm at.
[2:15:23] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[2:15:24] The whole key and the whole theme of the
[2:15:28] service this morning is that you have
[2:15:32] unlocked,
[2:15:34] undiscovered,
[2:15:37] godly
[2:15:39] resources in you
[2:15:43] which are are of deity.
[2:15:46] It's not from your parents.
[2:15:50] It's from your heavenly parent.
[2:15:52] You have that in you
[2:15:54] &gt;&gt; and God is determined to cause that to
[2:15:58] be developed.
[2:16:00] &gt;&gt; Amen. And God's going to allow
[2:16:02] everything that comes our way, whatever
[2:16:04] it might be, let's not shun it and let's
[2:16:08] not let us take it down. I I say in the
[2:16:11] name of Jesus Christ, don't let anything
[2:16:14] that comes your way in this world take
[2:16:16] you down.
[2:16:19] I've seen some where it's taken them
[2:16:21] down. You look at it and say, "God knows
[2:16:25] my life. God has allowed this to happen.
[2:16:28] God has brought this my way, and through
[2:16:32] it all, I will overcome."
[2:16:35] &gt;&gt; That's not just some nice words.
[2:16:41] &gt;&gt; You've heard me say this before while
[2:16:43] the musicians are coming.
[2:16:46] I never forgot this. a young single man
[2:16:49] listening to an old preacher, probably
[2:16:51] about my age, and he said, "You know,
[2:16:55] when you get in trouble and you get into
[2:16:58] a deep dark hole,"
[2:17:01] he said, "This is what I say to God.
[2:17:03] God, we are in a big dark hole.
[2:17:09] You get out, I'll hang on, and we'll
[2:17:12] both be out."
[2:17:14] &gt;&gt; And I thought that was good. I've
[2:17:16] remembered it all my life. But you want
[2:17:17] to be able to say we, not I got in here.
[2:17:21] Not that I created my own situation.
[2:17:23] Don't be found there, but we got into
[2:17:25] this hole.
[2:17:27] &gt;&gt; Amen. Through it all. Let's stand as we
[2:17:28] sing it.
[2:17:33] [Music]
[2:17:44] I learn to trust in Jesus.
[2:17:49] And I
[2:17:51] trust in God.
[2:17:55] [Music]
[2:18:05] I learn to
[2:18:12] sing that chorus again, please.
[2:18:26] I
[2:18:28] trust in Jesus.

[2:20:14] &gt;&gt; In the good times, the bad times. Oh,

[2:20:18] And then, Brother John, Brother John
[2:20:21] Andy's going to have you come and close
[2:20:23] us in prayer. Amen.
[2:20:28] Yeah.

[2:22:02] [Applause]
[2:22:20] I'm going to ask a brother John Andy's
[2:22:22] to come and pray. We're praying not only
[2:22:25] not merely to dismiss the service.
[2:22:27] That's not the main point. I don't know
[2:22:30] just exactly where your heart is in the
[2:22:32] state of your heart at this moment. But
[2:22:36] I am praying as I have already that God
[2:22:39] would take the words and that you by the
[2:22:43] Holy Spirit will see God in your life.
[2:22:47] And you'll see also if there's some
[2:22:49] obstruction,
[2:22:51] something that has hindered you, I
[2:22:54] encourage you, I command you in the name
[2:22:56] of Jesus Christ to dismiss it and to dis
[2:23:01] dispense with it and to surrender it up
[2:23:04] and let wash. Let it be washed away by
[2:23:06] the washing of the water of the word.
[2:23:09] Amen. Amen. Can the congregation say
[2:23:12] amen to that? You have let people
[2:23:14] praying for you. Settle it now with God.
[2:23:18] Do business with God and let the service
[2:23:20] be a fruitful fruitful service in the
[2:23:24] kingdom of God. Brother John, would you
[2:23:26] pray and pray for the people? I ask.
[2:23:30] Amen.
[2:23:33] [Music]
[2:23:36] Heavenly Father, just in the atmosphere,
[2:23:39] the close of this meeting, after hearing
[2:23:42] what you've spoken to us today,
[2:23:45] we just want to offer ourselves to you
[2:23:48] again.
[2:23:50] And let your word come out of our lives
[2:23:53] exactly
[2:23:55] what you've sent it out to do, to
[2:23:57] accomplish in each heart that's here.
[2:24:01] and all of us praying together that your
[2:24:04] word would be manifested in our lives
[2:24:07] according to your will and according to
[2:24:09] your way and in your time.
[2:24:12] Father, we've heard from the start of
[2:24:15] the service about a gentile lady that
[2:24:18] responded correctly.
[2:24:20] &gt;&gt; Father, at this end time when it is for
[2:24:24] the Gentiles and there's a promise that
[2:24:26] there's a Gentile lady that will respond
[2:24:29] correctly, We want to respond correctly.
[2:24:33] We want our hearts to say yes Lord. We
[2:24:37] are we want to be obedient children. We
[2:24:41] want to be a submissive wife. Every
[2:24:44] attribute that is in us. We desire to
[2:24:47] respond favorably according to your
[2:24:51] design and your thoughts and all that
[2:24:55] you would have within us. Let it flower
[2:24:57] out, Lord Jesus.
[2:25:00] This isn't just a prayer.
[2:25:02] &gt;&gt; This is our response to the word.
[2:25:05] &gt;&gt; Jesus,
[2:25:06] &gt;&gt; we could wash our feet with our tears
[2:25:10] and that would be wonderful. We could
[2:25:12] kiss your face and say, "I do."
[2:25:16] But Lord, we want to leave the service
[2:25:19] and go out and do what your desire is
[2:25:22] for our lives. And Lord, I feel that's
[2:25:25] the greatest response. Not just an
[2:25:28] emotion or for this altar to be full of
[2:25:31] people, but for us after hearing your
[2:25:34] word to say, I will do what your word
[2:25:38] has spoken to me. And Lord, Father, may
[2:25:41] you anoint every life, every man, every
[2:25:44] woman, all of us together individually
[2:25:47] to Lord, accomplish what your desire is.
[2:25:50] And we submit ourselves. We've heard
[2:25:53] your word.
[2:25:55] Now live it through our lives, God. Let
[2:25:58] the uncction of God and the anointing of
[2:26:00] your spirit be upon every vessel in
[2:26:03] every life. Even when we leave here,
[2:26:05] Lord, let the word continue to unfold
[2:26:08] and be lived out. Cross every tea and
[2:26:11] dot every eye and complete your design
[2:26:14] in our lives. Lord, we want to come home
[2:26:16] to meet with you. And we want to live
[2:26:18] forever in this atmosphere, but we
[2:26:21] understand that there's a work for you
[2:26:23] to do through our lives. And that is no
[2:26:25] less deity than it was Jesus Christ
[2:26:28] walking on the shores of Galilee. It is
[2:26:31] no less Jesus Christ walking in June the
[2:26:35] 1st, 2008. And we want to recognize that
[2:26:39] and say amen to the word of God. Flow
[2:26:42] through our lives, God. And let us see
[2:26:44] you even in the minor areas of our
[2:26:47] lives, not just the major, but the
[2:26:50] minors, that the symphony of your desire
[2:26:52] could be flowing through each heart
[2:26:55] that's here. And we pray one for the
[2:26:57] other. Lord, we pray for every brother
[2:27:00] and every sister that you, Lord, would
[2:27:02] just cap off our lives together with a
[2:27:05] capstone of your desire. and we believe
[2:27:08] that you're able to do miracles and
[2:27:10] signs and wonders that follow after the
[2:27:13] word. So we open up our lives to
[2:27:16] healings and deliverances and salvation
[2:27:19] and adoption and all that you have for
[2:27:22] us. We just believe that you are doing
[2:27:24] that right now because your word will
[2:27:27] not return unto you void for it is
[2:27:29] accomplishing what you sent it out to do
[2:27:32] in our lives today, God. And I pray that
[2:27:36] you'd continue this afternoon and in the
[2:27:38] evening service which we're so happy.
[2:27:40] And Lord, you've given us so much in
[2:27:43] this day. You've made it so easy for us.
[2:27:46] And we just want to respond accordingly
[2:27:48] and say, Lord, be it unto us according
[2:27:51] to your word. And we just yield
[2:27:54] ourselves today. Go with every life and
[2:27:56] continue your plan in Jesus name.
[2:28:00] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:28:04] God bless you.
[2:28:05] &gt;&gt; God bless you. We dismiss you in Jesus
[2:28:08] Christ's name. Thank you for being here.
[2:28:12] Trust you can go away with something and
[2:28:15] we'll see you this evening. You're God
[2:28:17] bless you. You're dismissed. Amen.
