Hallelujah. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; We're going to invite our pastor to bring the word, why don't we sing There is a fountain opened in the house of David. I'm so looking forward to the message this morning. Amen. If there's something on your heart that you just like to receive from the Lord, Amen. Just hold it in your heart before him this morning as we sing. There is a fountain opened. There is a fountain that's open in the house. [Music] to you. You were there was free of grace that falling down [Music] from Calary. [Music] Oh, come now and be. &gt;&gt; There is a fountain. There is a mountain [Music] or man in the house of David. [Music] And there are streams. There are streams of grace that's flowing. down from Calary. [Music] &gt;&gt; And we're going to turn to our pastor as he's going to just open the service in a word of prayer. And we do want to remember the outreach meetings next Saturday in Seattle. And there will be a meeting in the chapel immediately after this service this morning for those who are interested and to go over the details. And let's remember those on the front lines, amen, who are going out sharing the message. And also one prayer request for a young man named Kell. Uh my brother Jeremy just phoned in a friend of his. He was in an accident um with some explosives and the doctors say he will most likely lose all use of his hand. And they just ask that we would remember him in prayer. most of all that God would use this work the supernatural and move on his heart. Show him that there's a God who's alive today. Amen. Amen. And brother Ed, why don't you come? Amen. God bless you. I want to take the uh prayer request this morning just before we turn to the word. Uh, brother Dave Jabbernoff was at work the other day and about two days ago and uh, his cell phone rang and it was his uh, younger brother and informing him that his younger brother had two younger brothers uh, died instantly on the job at his work at just 43 years old. had a massive heart attack and was gone in just an instant. the uh the not ironic thing, but the supernatural aspect of this is uh under a great deal of pressure and it was Marilyn put a lot of pressure on this brother and um brother Dave did also because this is the only family that Dave has had and uh they the parents I think are are are passed away on both sides of the family And so he wanted him. Marilyn said, "You must come out. You must come out for Dave's 50th birthday." And well, you know, they couldn't, you know, the expense of it all and the time and the way it is and so on. And they pressed him very, very hard. So they came and Dave was able to spend about 10 days. Now, Brother David has sat down with this family and given them his entire testimony. And they know what he was and they know what he is, but they don't know exactly what made him. they, you know, they just know some dramatic change, something happens and it's so dramatic and they can't understand it. But, uh, he wasn't sure whether they'd come to church, but the whole family came to church. And he loves the sons. There's two boys, one nine and 11. And, uh, the boys had just written and made Father's Day cards for their father. And, uh, the father's not there the very next day. In fact, it's that afternoon. He's not there. And uh uh so it really broke brother Dave up because he's he said that his brother was the only one that was married and had children and was kind of the hub of the family. I just like to say to the church this morning, there isn't a person here has any guarantee that we're going to walk out the doors. And that's the way we better live. That's the way we want to live. We want to live very very uh dedicated and very sincere and live so that we're ready to go at any time. So there Dave and Marilyn are there and the funeral is tomorrow. So I'd like the church to pray for them as well because I believe that during that service that they were here, I don't know who it was, whether it was one of the song leaders that began to sing a song and I said, "Well, Brother Dave, that's your song. you better come up here and sing it. And so Dave Tbernoff came up and sang that song. And it was, I think, one of the first songs he ever sang in the log church. Uh, and and here's his brother, but the song leader didn't know that his brother and his entire family, his brother's wife and two children were here, and they just uh, you know, the children just loved Dave. And he was teaching them to pray at the at the at the breakfast table, and they would pray. And so let us pray &gt;&gt; to a God that hears prayer &gt;&gt; that God will achieve whatever it is he started and we know that he'll finish the work. So I just want to say to all of you that are here and young people alike and if you have your fathers and mothers here, your parents with you, it's something we want to be eternally grateful for. &gt;&gt; Amen. If we have men and women that know God and are here with their families, I say God bless you. Uh because we won't have this opportunity just like this in the next life. This life is here as a life of preparation. This is a life of of uh expressing Jesus Christ and doing our duty to the Lord. And so we want to take these requests to the Lord in prayer and uh all that have been mentioned and and what you have on your heart. Don't forget he's a god that hears. &gt;&gt; There's not a god of stone. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He's not a god of wood. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He even told the people, I'm He's not one of those gods. I'm a God with eyes. I'm a God with ears. I'm a God with a voice. We're thankful for that voice. We'll pray together. Heavenly Father, we are coming and approaching you, the Almighty one, in the blessed and gracious name of our Lord Jesus Christ. How thankful we are that you have given us another opportunity. You've extended your grace to us that we could gather here as the body of Jesus Christ. What a privilege. What a calling this is. What a glorious calling in the heavenly places with Christ Jesus. the conqueror. Lo, he is the mighty conqueror. And as we've heard the worship and the people singing today, Lord, we can we can join in and say, "All hail the name of Jesus. All hail the power of Jesus' name. Let angels prosper at fall." And Lord, within our own hearts, we bow before you, the almighty God. We pray that you will work and even deal more strongly, Lord, with those that you're talking to. Speak, oh God, in the name of Jesus Christ. Let the Holy Ghost speak. I pray, Father, for when you speak, it will be absolute truth. We pray, Father, that you will take your word this morning and bring it down to the level of the people. We pray father that your will will be accomplished. Come down amongst us in the name of Jesus Christ. Take every spirit under your control oh God. And whoever may be streaming I pray you will enter into the rooms wherever the places are father and that you will take control of the minds and bring them into subjection to the will of God. We're praying father for the requests that have been made this morning. each one of them and the hands that are raised, the hearts that are lifted up to you. Oh God, you've invited us that we should lay our burden down and bring our burdens and he carth for you. Father, we pray for brother Dave and sister Marilyn today that you will give them a special grace. Give them words that didn't come from their mind. I pray words that will be inspired by the Holy Spirit. Not only words of comfort, but words of life, words of eternal life, Lord, and bring to remembrance, I pray, those things that have been heard and those the atmosphere that the people were in. And today, Father, I pray for this service that it'll something will be achieved that will be of an eternal value, an eternal worth. Oh God, establish your people, destroy the works of the enemy. I pray you will bring them down, oh God, and lift your people on high. We thank you, Father. Pray your blessing upon Brother Tom also as he's ministering. Brother Jason Watkins ministering there in Arkansas. I ask that you'll conclude these services today with a mighty mighty outpouring of your presence in your spirit. And now, Father, we give ourselves to you unreservedly in Jesus name. Amen. Wonder if we could sing, Brother Ryan. All that I have and all that I am, all that I ever will be. Please. &gt;&gt; All that I have and all that I am. &gt;&gt; Have some prayer now. &gt;&gt; I shall be. &gt;&gt; Yes, Lord. Oh, it cannot love that I [Music] surrender to [Music] &gt;&gt; I'll invite you to take your Bibles and turn please to Matthew's Gospel the 24th chapter. going to commence reading at the 11th verse. And many false prophets shall ar shall rise and shall deceive many. And because iniquity shall abound, the love of many shall wax cold. &gt;&gt; But he that shall endure unto the end, the same shall be saved. &gt;&gt; And this gospel of the kingdom shall be preached in all the world for a witness unto all nations, and then shall the end come. Turn also down to verse 23. Then if any man shall say unto you, Lo, here is Christ, or there, believe it not. For there shall arise false Christs, false anointed ones, and false prophets, and shall show great signs and wonders in so much that if it were possible, they shall deceive the very elect. &gt;&gt; Behold, I have told you before, wherefore, if they shall say unto you, Behold, he is in the desert, go not forth. Behold, he's in the secret chambers. Believe it not. For as the lightning cometh out of the east, and shineth even unto the west, so shall also the son the coming of the son of man be. For wheresoever the carcass is, there will the eagles be gathered together, and the people could say, "Amen." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. You may be seated. I will ask you to be especially attentive today. This is a bit of a study also while I'm preaching and it's fairly heavy subject. So if you would just really be spiritually minded and ask God to give you uh give you the mind of Christ and uh pray for yourself and pray also for me. I just am uh standing here just wanting to know exactly how far the Lord wants me to go. Uh the scripture which we have just read uh this scripture describes a time when I want to use a phrase that is not uncommon to you. a time when there's only a razor's edge between uh the truth and error. Only a razor's edge. It's not some big great wide gap. It's just a razor's edge. Says many false prophets. when people bring start bringing up you know uh they start talking about brother Brandham for example or we speak about brother Brandham and then they say well yeah but the scripture says false prophets will arise well no that isn't what it says it says many so I say if you and I've said it many times to people if you want to refer to brother Brandham as a false prophet please tell me all about all the others and tell me about the many that are deceived uh many shall uh arise and shall deceive many. So life in our time often feels as though we are living on the edge, does it not? &gt;&gt; I think most everybody here experiences that just feels that I'm just on the very edge. I just I don't know if I can take anymore. And then if we had to define that, we'd probably end up by say using the word pressure. &gt;&gt; Well, it's some pressure. And well, your prophet told you it would be a time of pressure. &gt;&gt; Sometimes you can't even hardly define the pressure. Just comes from so many different directions. And you say, well, there's just so much pressure. And that pressure brings a person right almost like to the edge. Well, you want to know where your roots are. &gt;&gt; Amen. when you come to a time like that. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And so part of the service this morning is to determine where our roots are. Part of the service this morning is to expose Satan. That's why I asked you to pray. He does not like to be exposed. He hates the book of Revelation and he hates the book of Genesis because the one uh exposes where he came in and the other one exposes his end. But we also want to expose his trail all along the way. And so we're living in a time when there's a great deal of of pressure, but it's been prophesied that this age that these things would take place. So the many false anointed ones and shall deceive many, but that scripture says, "He that endures unto the end, the same shall be saved." So there's a knife just a knife's edge, a razor edge between the many and the he. And if you were to read it, you could underline those or uh highlight them as I do. The the many false prophets and many shall be deceived, but he that shall endure. And the prophet says few, &gt;&gt; very, very few. And if you're here today feeling that I'm one of the few, you want to rejoice over that. &gt;&gt; You want to say, "Thank God for grace that's been extended to me." And then someone might say, "Well, how do I know I'm one of the few?" Well, you better believe you're one of the few because there's no other way. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; No other way. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; How do we endure? I'm going to be following my studies very close. because I felt so directed. How do we endure? Well, you want to know how do I endure? Number one and first and foremost, you better know how to use the word. &gt;&gt; And when I say the word, I don't mean just quoting a scripture as such. And neither do I mean knowing the message or knowing a quote or knowing where to go so much. But you must know the fundamentals. And the fundamentals even when even when Peter made that statement, thou art the Christir, the son of the living God, even after that he he denied him and all of those things, but he had a fundamental in place. This is the Christ. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; This is the son of God. Amen. &gt;&gt; We have to have a fundamental in place. This is the message, the revealing of Jesus Christ. I maybe don't know a whole lot of other things, but we have the simplicity down to believe that is the word of God. And the fundamental is this message came to reveal Jesus Christ in the scripture. And then if you don't if you don't know the fundamentals and have that in place firmly in place brother Brandham I'll come to a quote later on says well it gets real thin you can fall to one side or the other. &gt;&gt; So it is a person can make too much of perhaps uh of an issue or too much of a person. You can make you can make too much of the preacher. You can make too much of the prophet. You can make too much of almost everything except the Lord Jesus Christ. You can't make too much of him, but you can make too little of him. And the thing that I see, if you read Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John, you'll find that the greatest error the people made was making too little &gt;&gt; of the vessel. They were making too little of Christ, Jesus Christ of Nazareth, who was the personification of the image of the invisible God. &gt;&gt; And still they made too little of it and they made too little of each other. &gt;&gt; They were at war with I won't say at war, but you know, they would argue and debate and who's going to be the greatest and they got into those kind of things. Well, I don't want to take so much time on that, but the prophet said that false Christs, this in Revelation chapter 2, false Christ would rise in the last days and would deceive the very elect if it was possible. So, there's a razor's edge between those that are deceived and the elect. &gt;&gt; It would deceive the very elect if it were possible. So there's and this speaks of the end time. It definitely speaks of the end time if it were possible. But he goes on to say, "But it's not possible." No sir, the elect was fore orained so they will not be deceived. &gt;&gt; So deception can be and is so close. And I can tell you with full assurance, it is it is closer today than it's ever been. If there ever was a razor edge between truth and error, it's today &gt;&gt; to the time when you need to you need to know your position in Christ, you need to know that you have the Holy Spirit. And if you haven't, you say, "Oh, spirit of God, come and direct my life. Come and permeate my body. Come and possess my mind." &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. come and give me a hunger for your word more than I've ever had. &gt;&gt; I can tell you one thing. I haven't seen anybody I haven't gone in contact with anybody that really dwelt in the message, the tapes and the and and and and consumed the books. I haven't I haven't found anybody of that nature that would uh that was so susceptible to go off track. But those that don't know I I don't know. I don't know what he said. I don't know. Well, if you're here and and probably you are, then you want to be concerned about yourself and set yourself a different diet. Habits are hard to break. &gt;&gt; If you have a habit of taking and hearing the word, then then you will continue that I'm quite sure. But if you do not have a habit, and most people do not have a habit, you have a habit of getting up and having breakfast. We should have a habit of of feeding daily upon the word of God and upon the message that reveals the word of God. Because I assure you, you can read much of the scripture and you don't know what that scripture means. But as you give yourself to the message, you will certainly you may not find out all that the scripture means, but you will certainly find out a whole lot more than you know. Now, would Will this congregation agree to that? &gt;&gt; That's been your experience. And so I would urge you to give yourself a diet &gt;&gt; of this of the message because the message was sent to deal with this age &gt;&gt; and tell you how to respond to situations that you have faced, are facing, or will face. &gt;&gt; The answer is there &gt;&gt; because it's Christ revealed. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; If you ever believe me, believe this. Believe me this time. &gt;&gt; Make it a diet for yourself. &gt;&gt; Make it a diet. When should I change? Start tomorrow. &gt;&gt; Start tomorrow. Say, I'm going to give some quality time. You may not have time till I hear an hour and a half message. But if you hear 20 minutes of good quality time, &gt;&gt; it will do you nothing but good. &gt;&gt; It will give you direction. Amen. &gt;&gt; It'll give you a cleansing. &gt;&gt; You'll find yourself things that were troubling you and bothering you. When you started listening, when you're done, it'll be gone. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; In Satan's Eden, he is using every possible avenue. &gt;&gt; Every possible avenue to advance his ultimate goal. And that ultimate goal is to get people to doubt God &gt;&gt; and to deny the truth. &gt;&gt; To doubt God and deny the truth. That is what his purpose is. Don't forget that. &gt;&gt; To doubt God and deny the truth. Although the elect cannot be deceived, Satan will continue his onslaught against the bride of Jesus Christ. And I think that we heard some of that when brother Murphy preached here uh the other night. &gt;&gt; He will still continue. And I call it an onslaught because he just refuses to give up. I won't glorify him, but I consider him the most stupid creature. Even though the prophet said he's a slicker and he's smart, but in another way, he's utterly stupid because he hasn't grasped that he has lost the war. &gt;&gt; But he will still fight &gt;&gt; and he will fight you. And we are even more ignorant if we will listen to him. &gt;&gt; Where does that put us? Friends, we're not here at a Sunday school picnic. &gt;&gt; We're not here playing church. &gt;&gt; We're here to speak the truth and to have it change our lives. &gt;&gt; To be affected by it. &gt;&gt; Now, in the spoken words, the original seed, he said Jesus had warned us of such things at the end time. I want you to take seriously, more seriously than you ever have, what God sent to you in this age through this messenger's mouth. &gt;&gt; And the reason why I do that is because you will be saved and and uh God will prevent you from being affected adversely if you know what the message speaks. It will be such a strength to you. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Such a pillar to you. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You may have wondered why I've been putting a lot of emphasis on this and and perhaps you'll even know better after today, but such emphasis on people people even mistake it and think you put an emphasis on the messenger. Well, the messenger and the message are one. &gt;&gt; Absolutely one. You can't separate the two. That's right. &gt;&gt; God God himself is the one who took uh brother Brandham and put him in the highest office in this generation. &gt;&gt; And we honor the man. We honor the office &gt;&gt; that the man that God put the man in. We honor the office. &gt;&gt; And and and soon as I hear anybody starting to try to uh you know pick at at the man, well, Brother Brandon made mistakes. Well, that's fine. Yeah, &gt;&gt; that's fine. He was human. But then the the next question that I have is why does this individual want to direct people's thoughts to that point? &gt;&gt; Because I usually find that it goes from the man to the message &gt;&gt; and the question is not so much about the man. Did the man make did the man have a flaw? Oh, now now does the message have a flaw? And then it goes from the message and then finally it's the whole it's the whole uh movement that God sent at this time. &gt;&gt; So he said in Matthew 24 spirits very close alike. Alike very close alike. He said deceive the very elected if possible. How can you tell them? He said how can you tell them? &gt;&gt; Listen very closely. He says, "Give them the word test." Now, I know that's a phrase everybody knows. Give them the word test. Well, if you don't even know what the word is, &gt;&gt; if you don't even know what the fundamentals of the message is, how are you going to give them the word test? Even if you know the the basics, the functions, everything has a certain uh uh you know, it has a certain principle to operate. Now, I step into my car as many of you will uh when we get done with the service today, we'll put our key in the ignition. Uh what's happening? I don't know what's happening. I just know it works. &gt;&gt; I I learned that it works. &gt;&gt; And I didn't even have to understand everything about it. All the wiring and where the where where everything goes. I just turn the key. I know the motor starts and I put it into gear and I know that the vehicle's going to move. Listen, you say, "Well, that is just utterly that's so simple. That's foolish." Well, that's how simple this is. &gt;&gt; You will never conquer the enemy without the word. &gt;&gt; And if you don't know how the word functions, how does it operate? How does it operate? Well, if you stay in the word, you will find out. Amen. &gt;&gt; You don't have to memorize chapters and quotes and all of these things. That's not what I'm saying. But if you stay in the word, if you just stay in the word, give yourself time with the word, you will absorb &gt;&gt; by the Holy Spirit, &gt;&gt; what you need because the Holy Ghost knows where you're going to be tomorrow. &gt;&gt; And he knows what you're going to face next week. &gt;&gt; He knows what you're going to face on down the road. you that are parents that are having children raised up and and and whatever you have in the future, he knows what you're going to face. So, he will drop into your heart. He will drop down in it'll become a part of your whole being and you'll have a you'll have a perception that you didn't have before you were in that message. And that message may well open up as it has for myself and multitudes of you open up what the scripture says. And that becomes your not your just your daily food. It becomes the direction of your life. &gt;&gt; So he says give them the word test. &gt;&gt; How can you know it? Speak the word and see what they say about it. That's right. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So you have somebody raise a question, raise a doubt about what you believe, give them the word test. &gt;&gt; You know, and see what they say about it. &gt;&gt; If they don't believe the word, they have no seed germ in them. &gt;&gt; And they are of the evil one. And and and deceive you. As the first bride was deceived, then the second bride was deceived. They are deceivers of the third bride by hybriding the word or trying to. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; But he's but it's a compound truth. They continue to hybrid the word &gt;&gt; and thereby try to by hybriding they deceive the first. By hybriding they deceive the second. By hybriding they try to deceive. But then you find out by predestination and the ordination of almighty God that bride cannot thus say the Lord be deceived. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham had a brother in the army. He said they called him rookie and he said he felt so sorry for him because he was just a little we guy. And they threw this pack on him and he said all kinds of hand grenades and armfuls of bullets and a gun. He says about 90 lbs. He says that's about all he weighed. And he get this 90 lb pack on him and then tells him to run for five miles. He said it was just incredible. But he said and you know he's got all this equipment. He's got a little shovel and and so on and hanging on him. And they they they tell him, "You might need this sometime. &gt;&gt; You you learn how to carry it. &gt;&gt; This is your protection." &gt;&gt; And so he's talking on that line. And he says, "Get used to it because you might need it. &gt;&gt; You might need you might not need the word this afternoon, but you might need it tomorrow." &gt;&gt; You say, "Well, it's so heavy. It's so it's such a weight. It just, you know, it it takes it takes I I could be doing other things or or uh uh I I could have so much enjoyment or free time or whatever your excuse is. That's not the point. &gt;&gt; The point is you better take the weight of the word. &gt;&gt; You better take and apply that word. Just stay in that word. I want to make that sentence clear. That word is not just reading the Bible. That word is not just reading the message, but it's giving yourself to it and absorbing it. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. You read it as as you're standing right there and he's speaking to you alone. &gt;&gt; And he said uh we always have to improve. And he said the old airplanes that we used uh back in the first world war, he says then the second world war. He says the ones that they just used in this last war now he says they're obsolete &gt;&gt; but uh but don't don't need them anymore. They've got jets. He says and we see you're always trying to improve to improve on the thing for defense. God doesn't have to improve. &gt;&gt; God gave his children his soldiers the very best &gt;&gt; the very best thing that could be given them. He gave them his word &gt;&gt; in the Garden of Eden. &gt;&gt; And man was to fortify himself behind the word. And listen now, and no devil &gt;&gt; can get him. &gt;&gt; Stay in the word. &gt;&gt; Now I I'm I'm laying heavy emphasis. Stay on the principle of the word. The principles of the word. The basic principles. Say, "Well, what are the basic principles of the word?" Well, one thing for certain, God will honor his word. &gt;&gt; Sometimes we're tested on that &gt;&gt; right to the very limit. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Because it doesn't seem that there's an answer, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; Even if you don't live to see the answer, God will answer his word. &gt;&gt; Amen. He says God doesn't have to improve. He gave his word in the garden. He says now the enemy spy Satan tried to find out what could he do to break into that. I want everybody's mind focused on this. Satan the spy. He tried to find out what he could do to break into this into this fortification. So he knew he just couldn't come out and bluff her Eve. So the only thing that he could do was to get her on reasoning. &gt;&gt; That's why I am opposed to reasoning. That's right. &gt;&gt; You cannot reason the word of God. &gt;&gt; It is what it is. &gt;&gt; It is what it means. It is. &gt;&gt; And I I trust that you won't get weary with my message this morning. And that's what God uses today to fortify his church &gt;&gt; is his word. &gt;&gt; And Satan comes around with reasoning power. Satan knew that that was a loophole &gt;&gt; and that was a place the people would break the easiest. Was that reasoning? &gt;&gt; Reasoning is to ask a question and maybe the question is irrelevant. &gt;&gt; But it's a question comes into your mind. Well, what about this? And will God do that? And what is God's will? And and uh is is this Satan or is this God and all these things? Well, one thing for sure is one thing absolutely for sure is just have a a basic faith &gt;&gt; that this word has come from God. &gt;&gt; This creation did not happen by itself. &gt;&gt; This is not the result of a big explosion in space. &gt;&gt; This messenger that came, this prophet that came uh was not sent by a seminary. &gt;&gt; Amen. That's right. &gt;&gt; He was not sent by Christian psychologists. &gt;&gt; He was not sent with a lot of learning. And what I want to say to you unequivocally is whenever you hear a question about him, all you need to do is go almost to any message go as I have this last week several times, go to the very end of the message and have this messenger revealing the secrets of the hearts of the people and then say to yourself, who is that? &gt;&gt; Amen. I'm asking you today, who is that? &gt;&gt; William Brandon from Jeffersonville. No, &gt;&gt; that's the other angel. &gt;&gt; That's got to be another one. &gt;&gt; Nobody knows those things. &gt;&gt; Who knows the past, &gt;&gt; who knows the present, and who knows the future. It's Jesus Christ. The same yesterday, today, and forever. &gt;&gt; And one thing is certain, he knows every single person here. every single person under the sound of my voice. He knows everyone and the and and the his people are the apple of his eye. &gt;&gt; And he's caring more about you than you care about yourself. &gt;&gt; You think I have such weighty things. He knows all about those weighty things. And he cares more about you. &gt;&gt; And you need to believe that. &gt;&gt; He carth for you. He said, "I'll never leave you. I'll never forsake you. Doesn't matter what situation you're in. I will never leave you." &gt;&gt; But we don't fully believe that. &gt;&gt; We don't believe it sufficiently. &gt;&gt; That's why we quite try to sort out our own things and make our own way. &gt;&gt; So he said, "We're always trying to improve." And this spy is trying to use reasoning. He says, "And that's why God fortifies his church with his word." He said, "If God said that the baptism of the Holy Ghost is necessary, &gt;&gt; I don't care how heavy it is and how much of a how much of the world you have to give up. &gt;&gt; He doesn't care how heavy that statement is. He doesn't care how heavy. You must be filled and baptized with the Holy Spirit. Said he doesn't care how heavy that is. He said you're going to have to use it one of these days to stay alive. &gt;&gt; That's why they That's why a soldier's packing that shovel. He might pack it for days and weeks, but one day he's got to dig a foxhole &gt;&gt; when the bullets are flying and get himself some protection. And I can assure you, he's happy he packed that shovel then. Yes, &gt;&gt; sir. &gt;&gt; One of these days you're going to have to use it to stay alive. He said it's the only way of survival. It's the only way of survival. You ought to be saying that it's the only way of survival [Music] &gt;&gt; to be filled with the Holy Spirit. &gt;&gt; We better get used to using the word against Satan. It's the only weapon that Jesus used. &gt;&gt; If there ever was a day that we needed, it is today. I'd like you to remember now these are these are common phrases but I'm I'm structuring this message and moving forward to some specific points. I want you to remember that it is the word it is the word that is a discerner of the thoughts and intents of the heart. The reason I say that is because perhaps very few here may go to a message and I do it frequently. I go right to the end of the message. If brother Brandham has said something very significant there and I and and sometimes I'm listening to a tape and I can just feel the same spirit that the people when they were listening to Jesus. You can cut the air with a knife. &gt;&gt; It is just so resistant. They're so resistant. You can feel the resist. How many &gt;&gt; How many here share that with me? &gt;&gt; You can feel it. And then I go to the very end of the message. And I say, I just wonder what God did &gt;&gt; to try to confound and to turn these people around. And then I find then he there it is there and he calling the people and calling by name and going from this and sometimes work right across the whole audience just go from there and up into the balcony and put one there, one there, one there. What's God doing? &gt;&gt; It's an added measure of grace. &gt;&gt; He's saying to the people, "Wake up people. This is the sign of the resurrection. This is the sign of the Messiah. And I'm displaying it openly before you &gt;&gt; think, oh, this is some nice gift. It's not a gift. &gt;&gt; It's the word. &gt;&gt; That's the word. And so if you conclude in your mind, this is one of the principles. It's the word that's the discerner of the thoughts and the intents of your heart. I'm looking at people here now &gt;&gt; that sat in a service here not very long ago and uh and the word was so discerning. &gt;&gt; I thank God we didn't know it or the preacher doesn't know it. I'm sure that those that have been called to the ministry and I I have it quite frequently and people will meet me and say you it sounded to us like you were around our table last night. This is very I've had people say to me just recently, you covered everything point by point through your service. Who's doing that? It's the word. &gt;&gt; It's not a man. &gt;&gt; It's not brother Biscll. It's not brother John or brother Tom or anyone else. It's not the special speaker. It was the same God. &gt;&gt; That's why William Brandham stood there said, "I don't know what I said. I'd have to go back and play it back because it just went through his mind. It didn't even go through his mind. Just bypassed, went through his mouth, but it went to your heart. &gt;&gt; And you may be sitting here this morning saying, "Dad is pricking my heart." That's not a man. That's God that dealt with me all through the maybe the last two, three weeks, and it's God that's seeking to speak to you. &gt;&gt; And if you're turning anybody down, it's him you turn down. That's right. &gt;&gt; So that's why I refer to those times which is in Hebrews. The word of God is quick and powerful, sharper than any two-edged sword, piercing even to the dividing of sunder soul and spirit and of the joints and marrow. And as a discerner of the thoughts and intents of the heart, it's not just discernment. And Pentecost made their huge mistake by attributing to a gift of discernment. And the prophet of God said it continually, but they couldn't hear him. Somehow the eyes and were blinded and the ears were dull couldn't hear them. The word is a discerner of the thoughts and the intents of the heart. It's the word that was proceeding out of the out of the mouth. &gt;&gt; So when anyone speaks to diminish or lower the prophet's office, then beware of who is speaking. Yes. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Just beware of who is speaking. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; The reason why Satan tries to erode or belittle the importance of the prophet's life is because he is trying to get you to doubt the word. &gt;&gt; He's not trying to get you to doubt his life. Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Trying to get you to doubt the word sir &gt;&gt; that came out. That's right. &gt;&gt; Many years ago, I ran into this. I just ran into, you know, like little uh oh, just little indications. Little indications that well, it's not it's not so much the messenger and uh you know, and the messenger wasn't so important. It's the word that's important. Well, we've had the word for centuries. &gt;&gt; Don't forget that. People say, "Well, it's a Bible, and I've heard this, check it out with the Bible." What kind of brain have you got to check it out? &gt;&gt; We had the Bible before the message came. &gt;&gt; Come on, folks. &gt;&gt; I'm not speaking to unbelievers. I'm speaking to believers. &gt;&gt; We had the Bible. Luther had the Bible. He drank beer and smoked and hated the Jews &gt;&gt; with the Bible. The Luther Bible doesn't have uh 1 John 5 and7. That's one of the main scriptures we have to change in this uh in this Chinese Bible. We have to change it because it's not there. In the Norwegian Bible, it's not there. Swedish Bible, Finnish, and I think in certain countries in in Europe, they don't have that. First John 5 and 7. And these three are one. There's three in heaven. I think the Father, the Spirit, and the Word. And these three are one. That scripture is not there. &gt;&gt; And now a prophet makes a makes a issue not a issue but he makes it very prominent. This is important. &gt;&gt; It's not there. &gt;&gt; So it makes a real problem for translators. Then people say well well you know brother Brandham made mistakes. Don't worry about his mistakes. &gt;&gt; Think about your own mistakes. Think about the mistakes that have been down through the church world. How in the world you talk about, you talk about Pentecost today having rock bands on their platform and all. What about that for a mistake? &gt;&gt; What about all the carries on of the world? That's it just infiltrated the church. Don't worry about picking a hole in the message. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; It can be at our level of understanding. There's a good chance we don't understand really everything that was said. &gt;&gt; Would you agree with that? &gt;&gt; Then we have to look at what is the intent &gt;&gt; in the message adoption. Now, if you feel it's kind of coming on, it's I'm setting you up a wee bit. In adoption, he says sin is not a creation. No sir, sin is a perversion. &gt;&gt; There's only one creator, that's God. &gt;&gt; Sin is righteousness perverted. &gt;&gt; What is an adultery? righteousness perverted. &gt;&gt; What is a lie? The truth misrepresented. &gt;&gt; The intent of misrepresentation. Are you listening now? &gt;&gt; The intent of misrepresentation. If I'm going to misrepresent something, misrepresent. I'm not representing it. I'm misrepresenting it. So, it's not a true &gt;&gt; representation. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; You follow me? Yes, &gt;&gt; sir. &gt;&gt; I want to give it as a lesson. I don't want you to miss this. To misrepresent, brother Brandham says that every time a lie is a misrepresentation, &gt;&gt; so of the truth. &gt;&gt; So, a person can speak a portion of a truth which is &gt;&gt; guile. &gt;&gt; It's guile. And guile is the same as a lie. Guile is a deceivers's tool. So they will speak a truth or speak a group of truths, but the intention of that &gt;&gt; is to have you believe a lie &gt;&gt; by the time you receive this representation because it's not a representation. It's a misrepresentation. &gt;&gt; Amen. Anybody is subject to that. &gt;&gt; That's why brother Brandham says say nice things &gt;&gt; about one another &gt;&gt; because when you say well say well some people I I'm just having such a trouble hard for me to think of anything nice to say. Well you better think about something nice to say and try and say a nice thing. &gt;&gt; Amen. to to misrepresent is to give a wrong impression &gt;&gt; or to act unfaithfully on behalf of. So if I was saying I'm saying to you if I was appointed to represent something to you going to give a representation but I don't want you to see it in the light that this person who has asked me to represent it. So someone here has asked me to represent something to you. &gt;&gt; And I don't want you to see it the way he sees it or the way he or she wants it to be seen. And so I go and journey and travel to the person I'm to carry the word to. But I represent I represent I represent it. All right? And I tell you what the thing is. I tell you what the project is, but I say, you know, this project's kind of shaky now. I'm misrepresenting it. This project has well you know &gt;&gt; and you can even do it with a gesture. &gt;&gt; Did you know you can do it with a gesture? &gt;&gt; Do you know that gestures are held up in court? &gt;&gt; You make a certain gesture. &gt;&gt; Maybe you never thought of that. I had a Jewish friend of mine. He says you can break you can break a man with your nose. Really? Yeah, you can break them. Cuz he was always into deals, making deals. So you say, "Well, uh, how much do you want for this? Do you know, well, you want a h 100,000 for it?" Doesn't say anything. Okay. Well, how about, you know, someone else has bid on it. Well, we want this very badly. You know, we'd like to we want to be successful on this. Uh, 100,000 won't do it. Well, how about 110 15 20? Okay. He broke broke the other guy. &gt;&gt; Never said a word. &gt;&gt; Never said a word. Never did anything fraudulent. &gt;&gt; But you ended up with something. And the and the other guy's deal was broke by this guy's nose. Hey, it works. Things are done by the millions of dollars based on that. What was that? It was a and that man is there and he misrepresents the person that he had been given trust to trust in. Now, uh, I just want to go quickly over over one little portion here. Are you all right yet? &gt;&gt; Uh, I'm not disappointed at all. This is exactly the way I expected the service to go. So, I just want you listening real close. Uh, and the message trying to do God a service, brother Brandham said, was something like in the days of Micaiah. Now, if I had time, I would take you through that whole service because it's just incredible the the the way it progresses, but I'm just going to take this little part here. So, something like in the days of Micaiah, the son of Imla, Judah and Israel were separated into two different kingdoms. Ahab was king over one kingdom and Jehoshaphat was over the kingdom of Judah. So Jehoshaphat and a and Ahab were two kings and the enemies had taken uh the god-given land from Israel and Ahab called Jehoshaphat to join forces with him that they will take and reclaim it back and we'll go to we'll go to war and take it back and Jehoshaphat said that sounds like a good idea that sounds on the perfect will of God and Ahab said there's our enemies their children are eating our food our children's food. And Joseph said, "That's right. We need to take it back. We all believe in having our inheritance. We don't believe someone else should just have it, so we should have it back." And he said that the kings got themselves dressed up, you know, because uh uh Josat said, "Do you have do you have a prophet?" Well, we've got 400 Hebrew prophets, &gt;&gt; and they prophesied &gt;&gt; and they were anointed. Yeah. &gt;&gt; And they prophesied and uh and Zedekiah, he was kind of the head amongst them, this Zedekiah. And he God made himself two horns and he came out before them before the kings. I mean, the kings are all dressed in their royalty. They're joining forces to go to war and get this land back. And he and he comes and he's prophesying and you want to believe he's inspired. He's and with these horns and he's giving an example. You will drive them out &gt;&gt; and God will give you great victory with these horns. You'll drive them out. And brother Brandham said Jehoshaphat had just enough of God in him to ask, "Do do you have another prophet? &gt;&gt; Do you have another one?" &gt;&gt; Yeah. Yeah. I don't like him. &gt;&gt; He always says nasty things about me and we don't like him. &gt;&gt; Uh well, bring him anyway. So they go and to go to get uh Elijah and say, you know, come and prophesy or Micaiah rather, not Elijah, Micaiah. Say, now this is what the prophets have prophesied. Make sure you say the same thing cuz we're all in unity. &gt;&gt; Sometimes unity isn't all that good. &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham said, "There's those out there say we're all one." Brother Brham screams out, "We're not one." That's right. &gt;&gt; There's a lot of stuff going on out there, even in the message. I don't want any part of it. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So, he says, uh, you're going to drive them out. And he said, and brother Brandham says this, and here's where a part of my message is coming from. Watch how close it gets on that razor edge. Yes sir. &gt;&gt; Now what is the razor edge? The razor edge is that here's one king, here's another king. Uh the land has been taken by the enemy. Yes, it should come back to us. Yes, it belongs to our children. Yes, we should be growing our own food on it and our children should be eating off that. Yes, that's true. And do we have any prophets? Do we ever are they anointed? Absolutely. Anointed with the word of the hour. Amen. &gt;&gt; Get this land back. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It all sounds perfect, but that's the razor edge. &gt;&gt; That's the razor edge. &gt;&gt; And Jehoshaphat was uniting with Ahab, which was one of the most wicked kings Israel ever had. &gt;&gt; And he had no business. And so they got Micaiah there and say, "You say the same thing now that they said because we want to agree together." and he couldn't agree and he told him said when I come back I'm going to deal with you. He said if you even come back I haven't heard from God. &gt;&gt; He knew where he stood. &gt;&gt; So I want to I want to just now that now I've got down to the point of this razor's edge. I want to speak about the razor's edge. I I mentioned about the elect and those that endure to the end and those that the are many. Listen friends, &gt;&gt; let's not live in some kind of vacuum. &gt;&gt; The many include your friends, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; The many may include family. &gt;&gt; The many certainly include somebody you know. Right? &gt;&gt; The many include nice people. &gt;&gt; And you got to have enough of the word of God in you to say, "As for me, in my house, I serve God." &gt;&gt; I challenge you young men. &gt;&gt; You serve God with everything that's in you. &gt;&gt; You young married couples, serve God with everything that's in you. You families that have children, serve God with everything that's in you. and all singles, married, unmarried, serve God with everything that's in you. &gt;&gt; I and my wife drove to church this morning. I sometimes think, I don't know what our neighbors think. We're out of the yard, into the yard, out of the yard, into the yard. They certainly know when church is on cuz we're gone. And we just drove out a block or two. And my wife says, "Just think, dear, we've been doing this all our lives." I said, "Yes, yes, we have. We've been doing this all of our lives. &gt;&gt; We were doing it before we were married. &gt;&gt; We were doing it as young teenagers. &gt;&gt; Going to church, going to Sunday school, coming back, playing the guitar, sweeping the floor, playing the piano, singing if we could sing, shaking hands with people. What can we do? Whatever we can do. Well, I wasn't a minister. We were just doing what we could do &gt;&gt; because this was our life. &gt;&gt; All right. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And it's still our life. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; There's a razor's edge. Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; But between being deceived. Now, now I want you to listen very close. Don't be distracted. The word in the Hebrew that speaks of being deceived, it is to be spacious or to be open or to be open-minded. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; If you tend to be open-minded, well, we need to hear everybody and we need to understand. No, you really don't. You need to know where you stand. Amen. &gt;&gt; You don't need a whole general feeling of what where everybody is. &gt;&gt; And it's not our business to know where everyone else is. &gt;&gt; Your business is to know where you are. &gt;&gt; And the fact that we've got telephones and social networking and everything else, that's a huge detriment. &gt;&gt; Well, that's what they are. That's what they do. That's what they got. Who cares what anybody else has? Who cares what they say? Who cares what else is in the message? How has this messenger ministered to you? How has this Holy Spirit spoke to you? &gt;&gt; Do that &gt;&gt; and you'll be happy. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. to be open-minded or to be naive and to be trusting and just to be so innocent and uh to or to be persuaded and that is in the Hebrew to be spacious to be open-minded to be trusting to be innocent kind of naive but in the Greek and Paul uses the scripture be not deceived and he says or to stray or to lead astray. &gt;&gt; It's an amazing thing. When someone goes astray, they want to see if someone else will follow them. They want company. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Or to lead aside from the right way or to wander and roam about. And I found when people leave the very heart and core of the message, &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; they begin, you mark my word, they begin to wander. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; They begin to wander and drift. and they don't really have a spiritual focus. &gt;&gt; And well, maybe it's over here. Well, maybe it's over there. Or maybe Well, I tell you what, it's actually right here. And what a messenger spoke about this. That's precisely where it is. And that's all you need. That's all I need. That's all this church needs for this entire journey that we have. &gt;&gt; That's right. To be deceived is to lead away from the truth or to lead into error. To deceive to be led into error and it and it also comes from a another uh word root word. It's a wandering, a straying about which the same as the Hebrew whereby one led astray from the right way roams hither and thither. It can even be a mental stray and to have a wrong opinion. And that's why I'm really afraid of these. Well, you know what I think. &gt;&gt; I'm not really trusting of people's opinions. I do want to know really what God has said. &gt;&gt; Is this all right? I gave you a slide last week. I'm going to try to watch my time here, but I gave you a slide last week and it was uh he said, "I I want you to know this is sure and you that listen to this tape that you might have thought today that I was trying to say that about myself, &gt;&gt; but that I was packing this message." He said, "Now every person listen, I have no more to do with it than nothing. No more than just a voice." &gt;&gt; So now he was a voice and my voice even against my better judgment. I wanted to be a trapper. &gt;&gt; But it's the will of my father that I declare to do and determine to do. &gt;&gt; I wasn't. Now when I say when brother Brandham refers to himself as I wasn't I want you to say within your heart Revelation 10:7 [Music] &gt;&gt; and when he says but he then I want you to say Revelation 10:1 &gt;&gt; there's a razor's edge &gt;&gt; between 107 and 101 &gt;&gt; and you can fall off to one side or the other &gt;&gt; but I'm determined to stay right on the edge &gt;&gt; we're living on the edge &gt;&gt; and we can do it. And you want to say, you want to say to yourself, it would be good for you to say to yourself audibly, I can do it. &gt;&gt; Let me hear you say that. I can do it. &gt;&gt; I can live on the edge. &gt;&gt; God has given us the perception to live on the edge. God has given you the balance to live on the edge &gt;&gt; to give it full regard. &gt;&gt; This prophet voice and the word that has come revealing Revelation 10:1 in the scripture &gt;&gt; and it will be correct. &gt;&gt; It is your protection. [Applause] And when you run into things in the message that are weighty, remember the shovel and the hand grenades and the bullets are for your protection. You're going to need that verse someday. [Music] &gt;&gt; Take it and carry it. &gt;&gt; It's for your protection. Amen. &gt;&gt; Say, "Well, I I know there's certain things, you know, maybe in my home or in my life that not are not quite in kind of a skew and a little bit out of that's fine. That's okay. Just keep listening. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Just keep confessing it. &gt;&gt; Just keep hearing it." &gt;&gt; And that word, there's power. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I'm trying to tell you, there's power. God has invested his power. Yes. &gt;&gt; In his word to do the transforming. &gt;&gt; Brother Roberto, I say you're listening very close. And God bless you. That was a wonderful testimony you gave me yesterday. Wonderful. And I sent it two or three places in the country across to the eastern United States up into the north. And one brother, brother, you mentioned brother Tim Dodd. and he he went immediately to the service that you spoke of and you said approximately 123 minutes and he went there. I wasn't aware I haven't seen it yet but brother Roberto I'd love to have had you even hear his testimony. You're a very excellent writer, brother Roberto. Excellent writer. And uh and he he was sitting over here. He'd been to some services, but God struck his heart and something that was said and he dropped to his knees right here on a at a pew and he said, "I was born again." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We've come to a lot of services, but he said, "I was born again." &gt;&gt; And a few services then he took he went on that basis and a few services later, I saw them while I was ministering. They're sitting right up in the balcony here and looking down and I didn't determine anything specific was happening but right after the service. Then I got an email from his wife and she said, "It is as though you were listening to our conversation. You spoke everything and I don't want to embarrass Sister Rosemary, but that was a wonderful testimony. You spoke everything." And she said, "My husband turned to me when you were done preaching and said,"Now, do you believe it?" And she said, "She was sitting there with feelings in her heart. My husband has spoke to brother Biscll and had never had a word of contact." the word. &gt;&gt; And as better, the sooner we find out, the word's a discerner of the thoughts and the intents of our hearts that are here. &gt;&gt; Still the same God. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Different people, different names, but the same God, the same Jesus Christ &gt;&gt; yesterday, today, and forever. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; And I want to be on good terms with him. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; When we cross the rivermen, sir. And then it was just I guess yesterday I don't know if it was brother Roberto but he felt so moved to speak to his son began to speak to him the Holy Ghost came down and the son gave his life to Christ. &gt;&gt; Tell it's a wonderful thing. Now, brother Roberto, you just must keep them in that channel &gt;&gt; against there against all the conflict of the enemy and whatever he may try to do. You just keep them in that channel. &gt;&gt; Are you still with me, folks? &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Sometimes people want to know if there's things happening, things happening when you don't even see it. Some of the greatest things happening &gt;&gt; when we don't even see it. So the razor's edge between knowing the seventh angel and he said, "I wasn't the one that appeared down on the river." &gt;&gt; He wasn't the one that appeared on the river. He said, "I was only standing there when he appeared." &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; We're not the ones that reach out and touch the hearts of individuals, but we're standing here when he's doing it. &gt;&gt; He's still doing the same thing. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. He said, "I was only staying there when he appeared. I Revelation 10:7 was not the one that performs these things and foretells these things." 10:7 isn't the one that foretells these things. That that happens as perfect as they are. I'm only the one that's near when he 101 does it. &gt;&gt; Can we say amen to &gt;&gt; I was only a voice. 107 was a voice that he used to say it. &gt;&gt; It was It wasn't what I knew. It wasn't what 107 knew. It's what I just surrendered myself to and that he 101 spoke through. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; That's not just him, friends. You're spoke of by that messenger. &gt;&gt; You are spoke of. &gt;&gt; You are spoke of. And he said this God, same God will be veiled in you. &gt;&gt; And right away the devil says you you want to say back yes me. &gt;&gt; That's not what I said, not what you said. It's what God's word said. &gt;&gt; Did he not say it? &gt;&gt; I will be with you and in you even to the end of the consummation of the age. I am in you. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; You have a mind of Christ in you &gt;&gt; greater than this mind here. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; It's not a man. It's God. &gt;&gt; If you realize when we're coming who's preaching this morning, God's in the midst of his people. Wouldn't make any difference who but if God has called someone to the word, he will take the word and and and develop that word within the heart of the person. &gt;&gt; And the Bible says this, help me out now. I just have to close, but I can't close for a little bit. Is that all right, please? &gt;&gt; Cuz we're just getting into the meat of some things. In 2 Thessalonians uh 2:1 and 3, Apostle Paul says, "Now we beseech you, brethren," notice, please how the scripture is laid out. "We beseech you, brethren, by the coming of the Lord Jesus and by our gathering unto him. &gt;&gt; This is the subject. &gt;&gt; This is the subject. I beseech you therefore people by the coming of the Lord and our gathering to him. This is the subject. And if there ever was a subject that pertains to our time, it's now. Now, I beseech you therefore people by the coming of the Lord and by our gathering to him. And he goes on to say that you be not shaken in your mind &gt;&gt; or troubled. &gt;&gt; Be not shaken in your mind &gt;&gt; because that's going to come at a time when we're we are being gathered together to him &gt;&gt; at the coming of the Lord. Be not shaken soon in mind or be troubled, neither by spirit, &gt;&gt; nor by word. &gt;&gt; Not some human spirit come buzzing around you and and some or by word or by telephone or by internet or by social netting or any other way. Do not be troubled by that. &gt;&gt; You young people need to hear me good. Do not in the name of Jesus Christ be troubled by that. &gt;&gt; Well, I'm shaking in mind. I heard that this was happening. Put it away. &gt;&gt; Shut the thing off. &gt;&gt; You don't need to hear that stuff. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; You don't need to hear that stuff. &gt;&gt; Put it away. &gt;&gt; In the name of Jesus Christ. Be not soon shaken in mind. &gt;&gt; Or be troubled &gt;&gt; by spirit, &gt;&gt; nor by word, &gt;&gt; nor by letter, as from us, as that day of Christ is at hand. &gt;&gt; Let no man deceive you by any means. For that day shall not come except there be a falling, and the falling is to forsake or a defection. In the military, there are some that defect. They said it gets too hot. There the the bullets are flying. It's us too heavy. Uh I I can't stand this bombardment and I'm going to defect. Just do not defect. &gt;&gt; Do not forsake it. &gt;&gt; That's called a falling away. &gt;&gt; I've heard the term too many times and I want to deal with it called church split. That is not what happened here. &gt;&gt; A good number left and a good number fellowship elsewhere. It was not a church split. I do exactly what I've done. I believe exactly what we have believed. The ministry here believes exactly what they've believed. Church split is not in the word of God. &gt;&gt; If people depart, they have their own reasons to depart and I just commit them to God. That's none of my business. It's between them and God. But I know one thing. I'm I'm just here exactly as we always have been. And we will continue with the original vision. &gt;&gt; We will continue with the original call. Amen. &gt;&gt; And I would say to you, do not use that term. &gt;&gt; You say, "Well, what is it?" It's a falling away &gt;&gt; in some cases. And it may not, but I pray it's not. I won't discuss it any further. I leave people between them and God. &gt;&gt; It's the only time I've spoken like this &gt;&gt; twice in two years. And I would be a I would be someone who'd be dumb if I did not speak &gt;&gt; those things which I have known for a long time. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; And have felt for a long time. &gt;&gt; And so I want to listen to Apostle Paul's. Let no man deceive you by any means. &gt;&gt; Not for that day shall not come except there come a falling away first. friends. Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Maybe family, &gt;&gt; good people, &gt;&gt; sincere people. &gt;&gt; Hey, that's all through the scripture. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; I said to my own beloved sister right here in my office. I said, I can find myself in the scripture. &gt;&gt; They left Moses. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; They left Samuel. Yeah, &gt;&gt; they left David. &gt;&gt; They left Jesus. They left Apostle Paul. They left brother Brham. &gt;&gt; I said, "Where are you in the scripture?" &gt;&gt; We were standing at the door. This exactly before God. No exaggeration. She's short. She opened her mouth and nothing came out. &gt;&gt; I said, "Where are you in the scripture? Friends, if you can't find yourself in the scripture, &gt;&gt; you got to find yourself in the scripture. Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; And the forsaking is actually the forsaking of your origin. &gt;&gt; Where were you born again? &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; Where did God meet you? &gt;&gt; You understand? &gt;&gt; That's right. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; To forsake is of separation or of departing or fleeing &gt;&gt; of separation. I want you to just hang right on your seat. Don't get any preconceived ideas here. Separation. This is exactly what the word is. If I if I never experienced these things, I'd have to read the same thing. To forsake is of separation of apart from the whole, of any kind of separation of one thing from another by which the union or fellowship of the two is destroyed or of the origin. Apostle Paul uh rather Apostle John in the revelation said I will put on I will put on you none other burden and he said the word for burden is weight or pressure and I believe that people come under weight and do come under pressure. We all do and the pressure of the dark age was either to bend or be broken to bow or die. It was the Inquisition, the power of the empire backing up satanic worship. Uh be organized or pay with your life. He said each age has had its pressure. Now he deals with our age. Each age has had its pressures. And for example, the great burden of the last age is the pressure of riches &gt;&gt; and soft living &gt;&gt; and the nervous tensions in a complex age that we seem unfit to live in. Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; That describes us to the letter. &gt;&gt; It's a complex age that we seem nervous age that we seem unfit to live in. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; I go for a little walk. I don't want to take up too much time of this, but we go out for a little walk and get some exercise. My wife says, and it's it's my wife who says it. She says, you know, a woman can wear anything. They're walking down the street in their leotards &gt;&gt; down the public street &gt;&gt; in leotards and nothing much. You know, some little jacket up here and a a sock for a a blouse or a top. It's absolute disgraceful. &gt;&gt; But you know what it is? I feel sorry for the people. Brother Bram said he feels sorry for the women. It's like they're caught in a net. &gt;&gt; They're caught in a net of fashion. I'll be glad when they take that demon of fashion, cast him into the lake of fire. &gt;&gt; There'll be no none of those people giving designing garments for the redeemed. [Applause] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; I'm on my way. &gt;&gt; To heaven's land. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Just bear with me, please. There's a ra a razor's edge in this day of complex pressures &gt;&gt; between those who give into it &gt;&gt; and those who go on. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Now I want to say everybody has ears and everybody's got eyes and you hear certain things and so on and so forth. Uh some time ago I became aware and I'm I'm I'm going to deal with a specific thing just now. I became aware that uh the website voice of the sign had uh had a big article on it concerning was brother Brandham's death foretold in 1964. How many have seen this? &gt;&gt; Yes. How many have not seen it? Fine. I'm speaking to all of you and I don't want you to have to go up on that. It was posted on February 26. This is right in line with what I am speaking. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; So, the question is, and if you don't agree with some of the my comments, that's fine. This is our pulpit. This is the one that I've preached behind all the years of my time here. &gt;&gt; And I will take this liberty. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And I'll expect you to hear it as it's coming in the right spirit. &gt;&gt; Was William Brandham's death foretold in 1964? All I can think of the first question in the Bible was, "Hath God said?" &gt;&gt; That's right. That's right. That's right. &gt;&gt; And soon as I hear a question, I want to be sure that it's a question either God is asking &gt;&gt; or what is the intent &gt;&gt; of the question? &gt;&gt; Is the intent to establish and edify the body of Christ? Or is the intent to raise more questions &gt;&gt; and to erode the faith sir &gt;&gt; and confidence of people sir &gt;&gt; in the word of God? &gt;&gt; Yes sir. So here's the question. Was it foretold? And the question came to the website. So what I'm dealing with here now is the website and the person or the individual who commented on the on the uh experience on the events. So deals with two or three prophecies, two prophecies mainly. And did Kenneth Hagen and Anna Schrader predict William Brham's death in 1964? It's amazing they didn't say anything till 1990s. &gt;&gt; The prophecies that you refer to and now this is the one who's commenting on behalf of the website to the one who asked the question. And I don't know whether it was a legitimate question or whether it is all engineered. &gt;&gt; Who wrote the question? There's no name. Who's answering it? There's no name. &gt;&gt; I'm standing here. You know who I am. &gt;&gt; And this is absolutely public. And this is archived. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; I don't have any confidence and I have no respect for anybody that's not that's afraid to put their name to it. Say, "This is me." Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But because some have heard it and because of other things taking place at this time, you I would feel as though I was doing you an injustice. &gt;&gt; Because part of my ministry, part of the servant of God is to warn the people. &gt;&gt; You don't warn them about something that's past. You warn them about something that they may face. And if you are faced with a question, then you know exactly where you stand. The prophecies, I want to stop right there. This is the one that's commenting, the individuals commenting to the question. How is he authorized? He or she, how are they authorized to call them prophecies &gt;&gt; and sew a seed in your mind that they are prophecies? Amen. &gt;&gt; All kinds of prophecies have been spoken today in churches and we don't need to hear it. &gt;&gt; We don't only have prophecies, we have a prophet. &gt;&gt; The prophecies that you refer to are contained in two books listed below. We purchased these books to ensure that our analysis whose analysis &gt;&gt; right &gt;&gt; of the prophecies prophecies who says they're prophecies &gt;&gt; but they've already sewed seeds in your mind &gt;&gt; and I want you and I say this with kindness I call them seeds of discrepancy &gt;&gt; because it's misrepresentation you don't know that it's a prophecy &gt;&gt; but they are suggesting to you and no uncertain terms that they are prophecies. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; That the prophecies would be as accurate and as factual as possible. Now the stage is set. We have purchased the books. We have read them and we have done an analysis. Who has done an analysis? I want the filter of the Holy Ghost to do analysis &gt;&gt; and that the prophecies would be as accurate as possible and they are taken from the two books and one is my diary secrets by Mrs. Gordon Lindsay. Freda Lindseay was the wife of Gordon Lindseay who was the editor of the voice of healing and one of William Brham's early campaign managers. And in the in another second book was he gave gifts unto men a biblical perspective of apostles, prophets and pastors that is their own description of themselves. &gt;&gt; Who says it's a biblical? I'm not being philosophical. &gt;&gt; I'm saying has God said &gt;&gt; that what he wrote &gt;&gt; Amen. and his his interpretation of the word. I do not know. I'm simply raising the question. Is this a biblical uh perspective of apostles and prophets? I don't think so because he rejected God's prophet. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; And that book was printed in 1992. If this was a prophecy in 1964, why wasn't the prophecy given in 1964? Why wasn't it told to the people that were concerned? Why wasn't it spoken to the family? Listen friends, this got more holes in it than Swiss cheese. [Music] &gt;&gt; Kenneth Hagen was an influential American Pentecostal preacher who is often referred to as the father of the word of faith movement. Hagen was known to William Brham who said the following about him in 1955. And that is in the message uh glorified Jesus. And I read the entire quote about about what brother Brandham said about uh brother Hagen and he said that uh they were there having brother Brandham was there having meetings and he says that he just learned that another gentleman was over here having meetings and they would have joined with the meetings. they would have come to brother Brandham's meetings but that uh the meetings had their meetings had been scheduled for about a year they've been all staged and he used the word stage set for about a year and so they felt that they must go through that he says we love the brothers and we just pray God's you know that God will uh be with them and I don't know what else he said but I didn't feel to put the whole quote here uh just day for the purpose of today's service and to make it as short as possible The article begins with a question. Was William Brham's death foretold in 1964? This individual begins by calling them prophecies. As I made a comment, this is the language of the authors Gordon Lindseay from his wife's diaries and Kenneth Hagen. The objective of these prophecies so-called is solely to put forward the cause &gt;&gt; the cause of William Brham's death. the the writer and the com whoever made the comments on v on on uh uh the the sign uh &gt;&gt; thank you. Whoever made the comment there is spending the time discussing the prophecies. Well, this one said this and she did from her memory and this one was perhaps more accurate because it was from a written note. That that is isn't even the point. The point is what was the purpose of the prophecy and of and of the person who is putting this forward that these are prophecies and was his death was his death uh prophesied in 1964 and this one prophesied this and this one prophesied that this one had it written and Mrs. Lindsay took it from memory and it was it's in her diary. That's not the point. Why did the prophecies come and why were they included in the book? And I will just tell you and I will give you their own words. It was because brother Brandham supposedly was gone into error &gt;&gt; and was doing great damage to the body of Christ. Is that so? &gt;&gt; I'll have you know they're speaking about the most glorious thing ever happened to me. Amen. [Applause] [Music] &gt;&gt; I'll tell this congregation and all who ever hear this message archived or live, they were refusing the word who is Christ &gt;&gt; who is the third pull of this ministry &gt;&gt; and finding fault with him. And thus they had to discredit the messenger. &gt;&gt; And in discrediting the messenger, they did a serious injustice to Jesus Christ who was being revealed. And so what do we have? They refused him when the word came when he was here on earth &gt;&gt; because he said things that they said it's unscriptural. Eat my flesh. Drink my blood. This is a He's a like a vampire. &gt;&gt; He wants us to eat his flesh and drink his blood. No revelation, &gt;&gt; no understanding. &gt;&gt; And so they discredited him and forsook him. &gt;&gt; That's right. The prophecy stated that the leader, this is the first prophecy, the prophecy stated that the leader of the deliverance movement was soon to be taken in death because he was getting into error and the Lord was having to remove him from the scene for that reason. after brother Hagen left. This is brother Hagen had come to Gordon Lindsay's home and apparently had given him a piece of paper whatever more and this is from uh Freda's Lindsay's diary I believe he said and and after Hagen left I asked what do you think about this is this Brham there was a his wife that asked him Gordon answered gravely yes it is Brandham. He is getting into error. He thinks he's Elijah. He thinks he's the messenger of the covenant. I just want to stop there. What has this got to do with believe the sign? &gt;&gt; Come on, folks. &gt;&gt; What has this got to do with believe the sign? &gt;&gt; And this has infiltrated the message realm. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. And I say it's blasphemous. &gt;&gt; It is seeds of discrepancy. &gt;&gt; And has no business in the company of the believers. &gt;&gt; And I can tell you I so hesitated even putting this on. I did not scheme this. These were just put on a slide this morning in the office while you people were singing because I had determined I would not show it to you. But I felt it left me with such heaviness and such sadness &gt;&gt; that people who stood behind this pulpit sir &gt;&gt; and perhaps fellowshipped in this company of people &gt;&gt; would be responsible for this. And let me tell you something in warning that's not where it ends. &gt;&gt; I have never seen I have never seen Satan infiltrate with with things that are error. The error is not there. The error was is thinking that I'm sorting out some prophecies. It's not that. It is why did the prophecies come? Why did these people speak these prophecies? Cuz that's what they believed in their heart. &gt;&gt; And you have to decide if you wish to. Was he an error or was he not an error? I say he had thus sayeth the Lord. And and I got I got proof on that. I got proof on that. And there ought to be every hand raised in the air saying, "I believe what that messenger spoke." &gt;&gt; That's true. Amen. &gt;&gt; The sad thing is, this is Gordon Lindseay speaking, that unscrupulous men around him are putting words into his mouth and due to his limited background, he is taking them up. On Christmas Eve 1965, he departed this world even as the prophecy whose prophecy &gt;&gt; when printed in 1990s. Is this something prophetic? &gt;&gt; Absolute nonsense. &gt;&gt; He departed this world even as the prophecy had stated a tremendous ministry that had veered off course. How do you like that one? We're following something that's veered off course. I say I was not on course &gt;&gt; till I heard this message. [Applause] And this one is the prophecy as retold by Kenneth Hagen. He he retold it and said the following. In this prophecy, notice it's always prophecy. The Lord also said at the end of 19 he was with a group of people in a motel and rather in a restaurant. He says, "I've got to go. I've got to go and pray right now." So they all went and prayed and he prophesied for two hours apparently. And this prophecy says the Lord also said at the end of 1965, he who now stands in the forefront of the healing ministry, as a prophet, uh as a prophet will be taken out of the way. He'll make a false step and Satan shall destroy his life, but his spirit will be saved and his works will follow him. We need to pray for people that would put this up on believe the sign. Amen. &gt;&gt; On December the 27th, 1965, my wife was at the beauty salon. Beauty parlor. Oh, was her hair being clipped? [Applause] And she called home to say that this minister was who was the leading prophet at the time had been in an automobile accident. he was unconscious and the doctor said he would not regain consciousness. I told her there's no use praying he'll be dead within 2 or 3 days. I said that because I remembered what the Lord had said in the prophecy. Then the Lord explained to me he had to permit him to be removed because of the damage he was doing causing to the body of Christ. Try to tell that to the folks in Congo. Try to tell that to the people in Africa. &gt;&gt; Try to tell that to the people who've just come out of their utter confusion and darkness in China, &gt;&gt; in the United States, in Canada. &gt;&gt; You know what this does to me? It just shakes my roots down further. &gt;&gt; And I don't shake it. I just become more determined than ever. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Glory. Amen. &gt;&gt; Glory. Glory. Glory. the question. Now, now here's the one who's commenting on behalf of believe the sign. There's no name. We don't know who's commenting. I have my thoughts, but they're starting with the question. All right. Now, now you'll have to just pay real strict attention because I got to read the rest to you. Is that all right? &gt;&gt; And then I'll close this. This person gives his assessment of the two accounts, Mrs. Lindsay's and Kenneth Hagens and then takes the scripture. Excuse me. &gt;&gt; Who's taking the scripture? &gt;&gt; Is this Is this a woman? Is it a man? Is it a man? Is he called to handle the scripture? &gt;&gt; Or is he one that's tampering with the word outside of his calling? &gt;&gt; What is he? Yeah. &gt;&gt; Is he a carpenter, a plumber, a what is he? &gt;&gt; So he says there is a scriptural principle found in Deuteronomy 19:15, Matthew 18:16 and 2 Corinthians 3 and 13 and1 that evidence established by two or two or more witnesses should be regarded. He's taking these prophecies back to the scripture that this is something that's established in the mouth of two or three witnesses. They're not witnesses. &gt;&gt; True. &gt;&gt; Why am I saying that? Not to discredit something, to warn you. &gt;&gt; That this is how close &gt;&gt; and there will be people who will read this and become destabilized. &gt;&gt; And that is leading astray. with intent. &gt;&gt; So now we're just discussing the prophecies. No, they're not discussing the prophecies. The intent is to lead people astray so that they lose confidence in the messenger. &gt;&gt; And I say the whole thing is a falsehood. &gt;&gt; There's no one can prove to me that those are thus sayith the Lord prophecies &gt;&gt; and should be given any space in anybody's mind. And that's why I hesitated even to show it. You don't even need these seeds in your mind. But I want to show you there are seeds of discrepancy even today that are attacking the very heart of the message. And the prophet says it will be in the end time. Because Matthew 24 is a scripture of this time. Listen, young people, you won't only see this, you'll face other things in the future. You got to know one thing. What is my weapon? The word. The word is your only weapon. Let the word wash you. Let the word just absorb the word. Even when you don't know you're getting anything, absorb it. You need to hear it. This congregation needs to intensify their diet of the message. Yes sir. &gt;&gt; In the mouth of two or three witnesses should be regarded. Apart from the fact that the two prophecies are not identical, the combined testimonies of Kenneth Hagen. This is the answer from voice of God. I mean I'm sorry. Believe the sign. &gt;&gt; The two prophecies are not identical. The combined testimonies of Kenneth Hagen and Freda Lindsay point to the conclusion, listen to this, the conclusion that prior to William Brandham's death, a prophecy was made that he would die before 1965. Still giving it the credit of being a prophecy. Right. &gt;&gt; And that's the conclusion of someone who's authorized authorized to write on behalf of believe the sign. Now, part of the reason I'm getting up and a lot of you perhaps don't even know a thing about it. I heard about this within hours. I heard about it. I got brother John Andy sitting behind me got a phone call from way down in southern United States and says, "Do you know what is on believe the sign?" And and we just brought it up. I just scanned it. Uh a a widow of a trinitarian preacher and another trinitarian giving prophecies concerning my prophet. Not on your life. I got on the phone says take that believe the sign off of our website &gt;&gt; immediately. [Applause] [Music] [Applause] &gt;&gt; I would say that we'd be in danger if we just sat back and took this casually. This can't be taken casually. We have to take a stand. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Not against but for. When we take a stand for Christ, for the word, for his spoken word, this is the revelation of Jesus Christ in our day. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; He says the two and he goes on the two versions of the prophecy. Notice the prophecy is just given out. Poor people who don't understand, who maybe don't have a a minister that'll stand up and speak, they continue to say, "Oh, they are prophecies. They are prophecies." And the question is, who said they're prophecies? &gt;&gt; You know what, friends? You're looking at a man. I have heard hundreds of prophecies &gt;&gt; and anointed. Absolutely anointed. And they just make your flesh tingle. &gt;&gt; And some of them were just as false as a $3 bill. &gt;&gt; And I've told it to you here. I don't mind telling it to the internet. A a young couple in our church were to go to the Arctic. They went to Vancouver Island. My father was to go to Africa. He never left. He never left Canada. My sister and her husband were supposed to go to to Laos or Indochina they called then and his brother was supposed to go to Indochina and my brother-in-law went to Saskatchewan and his brother went to Jamaica. What do you mean out of that? Can the Holy Ghost say something that's totally false? &gt;&gt; No. &gt;&gt; I say no. &gt;&gt; Say it for what it is. Amen. &gt;&gt; It's a lying spirit. &gt;&gt; It's not the Holy Spirit. How can the Holy Spirit speak such a thing? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Come on, folks. Deal with it. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Two versions of the prophecy also differ on the timing of the error that William Broner would make. really believe the sign. Someone who was in this church and that's not where it ends, friends. This will go back and now I will make a prediction not a prophecy. This will people who write these things are on their way back to their Pentecostal roots. &gt;&gt; Because they have already joined with the Pentecostal spirit. Yes sir. &gt;&gt; Goes on to say it is interesting that it is interesting to note that both William Brham and Kenneth Hagen agree. Notice now I wish I had this on. Listen very close. The comment the one who is making the comments makes this statement now for multitudes to read and have read. It is interesting to note that both William Brham and Kenneth Hagen agree that Anna Schrader was a prophetess. That's absolutely false. And the very quote that he refers to here, but the people won't have access to the quote. The very quote says this. Here's little Miss Strader here. I was talking to her today in there. You wonder why she lays like that. Brother Bram was talking about how a vision drains him and what it is to have a vision and in that in that position. He says, "And you wonder why she lays like that." He says, "She has a gift of prophecy." &gt;&gt; That is not saying she's a prophetist. Right. &gt;&gt; And brother Brandham makes a distinction and teaches us a gift of prophecy. You can prophesy once and maybe never prophesy again. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; You may prophesy again. A gift of prophecy is exactly what it is. It's a gift to prophecy. &gt;&gt; And you may prophesy once. He said it's not a prophet. &gt;&gt; He said there's a difference between a prophet and the gift of prophecy. So I will say it may be the thin edge of the wedge but some have already fallen off the side &gt;&gt; because they don't know the word of God and have and are not acquainted with that what the messenger said. &gt;&gt; If they read that they couldn't say this &gt;&gt; and I felt I need to make that a point with you. He never once called her a prophetess. That's right. &gt;&gt; But it's brought forward that both William Brandham and Kenneth Hagen and and I just have to tell you it's a lie. It's not true. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; And then when I read that, I say why? The threeletter word why. Why? What is the intent? Why does this person say that? Cuz he wants you to believe that your prophet called her a prophetess. And that is absolutely false. &gt;&gt; Do you hear me, church? &gt;&gt; And I don't want you to swallow something up if you've ever read it. And I don't want you to even bother going, but this is for anyone in the future. And what you will what you will hear, you'll hear further things &gt;&gt; because people are on their way back to their roots. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; And they're giving up the message. These are the seeds of discrepancy that takes a person away from the message. And I say to this congregation and all who will hear me, have no part of it. &gt;&gt; Do not be troubled &gt;&gt; in mind or in word or by letter. &gt;&gt; Your apostle Paul says, "Be not troubled &gt;&gt; in mind or in word or in letter. have no part of this. &gt;&gt; So, well, I have friends that just a second. This isn't based on your friends. &gt;&gt; This isn't based on your family. This is based on the word of God. &gt;&gt; Apostle Paul spoke it and a proven messenger has said it. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And I quite frankly believe it. You know, sometimes in that very message that we refer to it is uh conference. Brother Brandham said she has a gift of prophecy in that very message. This quote is inserted here to substantiate that William Brham considered her as a prophetess which number one is totally false. But for those that are ignorant or maybe naive or could be led astray in the way, they put the quote there. But I said, why didn't the commentator, why didn't they go to the end of the message? &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Where the where brother Brandham says this now, father, something to this effect. You can read it. It's a conference uh November 25th, 1960. And he goes to go to the end of the message and see the Lord Jesus Christ &gt;&gt; coming on the scene &gt;&gt; and starting and he just starts and calls people by name. Says there's a dark shadow uh circling this person and it's epilepsy. And he talks to another person. He gives her her name. Gives another person their name. Give who was that? That was listen to me. That was the other angel that these people don't know. [Applause] &gt;&gt; That's all there is to it. &gt;&gt; No, the message can become articulate perhaps in the message, but the person, the message is a person. &gt;&gt; If you've read the message as a book, you're missing it. &gt;&gt; It's the other angel. &gt;&gt; One that you can feel, one you can communicate with, one you can love, one that speaks back to you. Come on, congregation. I'm talking about a person who said he loves you. [Applause] &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I had those quotes. I had that very thing. But I'm I've got to end right now. My time has slipped. I've been so affected and you have heard me preach many many times and this is very unusual for me. So I take it extremely seriously, extremely seriously. But this gentleman or this person says, "My current opinion about Anna Schrader's prophecy is that number one, both Kenneth Hagen and William Brham have publicly acknowledged that Anna Schrader was a prophetess." I say false. Right. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; That never happened. &gt;&gt; That she has a gift of prophecy. Millions have a gift of prophecy. &gt;&gt; Did she prophesy about his death? I do not know that a note was handed somebody and they remembered and it's written in 1992. Forget it. &gt;&gt; Just go to the go to the conference. Go to the message. go to the end of the message and hear a prophet of God say, "Now, Father, come now and confirm that I have spoke the truth." &gt;&gt; And that's the one that's getting you into error. I say, "Give me that kind of error." &gt;&gt; It's an error to the world. That's fine. But give me that kind. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Give me him who knows my name. Give me him who knows where I came from and where I'm going to. [Music] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; This is his opinion. Kenneth Hagen's version of the prophecy. Prophecy is likely paraphrased. Number three, Kenneth Hagen's version of the prophecy is subject to considerable amount of error in its retelling as he is the only one only one to document the prophecy and has and and as he was not present to hear the original prophecy. What's the purpose of that is so what's the purpose of putting it in a public domain for everyone to read? &gt;&gt; What is the purpose? &gt;&gt; Does it make any sense? &gt;&gt; No sense to a balanced mind. Yeah. &gt;&gt; What do you say? Well, you know, it's it's subject to all kinds of error, etc., but you're going to put it up there for the people to read. You wanting somebody to believe that, you know, you have such a knowledge of these things. I don't understand it. Number four, it is very unlikely that Anna Schrader would first prophesy that William Brham was sent because she spoke, she interpreted some tongues that was in a service. And Gordon Lindsay said it was such a powerful thing. And uh uh she prophesied that William Brham was sent forth to forrun the second coming. Whether or without the ministers is outside of the scope of this article. that is other ministers because Gordon Lindseay said in his in his uh book that that he would forun the second coming and and other ministers and then prophesy his doom for walking in the way of Dowi. Dahi Dowi is one uh those you that know he had established uh believe that he the spirit of Elijah was upon him. Number five, it is possible that Anna Schrader did prophesy his death at some point prior to 1965. Many people tried number many people try to discredit William Brandham's entire ministry. This is now his comment. Uh the entire ministry and teaching based on their presumption that he went off in the end. While these prophecies, and he keep putting that forward, these prophecies are the first indication we have that William Brandham's death may have been the result of some grave error on his part. Kenneth Hagen's prophecy does not define the error. The error may not have been doctrinal at all, but perhaps a simple expression of humanity like the anger that Moses expressed which cost him the inheritance in the promised land. Well, that's not exactly so. That was all in the plan of God. Moses had to leave so Joshua could take them in. Jesus said, "It's expedient for you that I leave so that if I don't leave, the Holy Spirit won't come." Joshua was Jehovah's savior. He had to take the people in and appoint them their land. And that's why Joshua was preached on. Oh my. That's why Ephesians is our Joshua. I'm getting weak, folks. But listen to me while I come through this thing. Th this is urgent that you need to know this &gt;&gt; and it's urgent that it needs to come to the surface &gt;&gt; because I say in the name of the Lord, you'll be hearing things in the future and you need to know where you stand. &gt;&gt; And I say, bathe yourself, &gt;&gt; eat, &gt;&gt; devour &gt;&gt; the word. Not for memory's sake, not to try to learn things, just to absorb the atmosphere of the message, &gt;&gt; the atmosphere of the other angel. cost Moses his inheritance in the land. And I have said this statement is the is the result of complete ignorance of the plan of God. Joshua another office had to take the people in exactly as Jesus could not take his disciples into the baptism of the Holy Ghost. And that could only come after the spirit of the promise was given. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. This is my comment now and I'm closing to substantiate that these articles as prophecies of brother Brandham's death is to substantiate the reason why he went. That's really I'm uncovering it now. &gt;&gt; That's really what this person is doing. They are not substantiating. Well, the you know the prophecy could be this way was you know the prophecy this and the prophecy that and something else. That's all that's all smoke and mirrors. &gt;&gt; You say what was the reason of the prophecies? The reason of the prophecies every instance was to get to the people that the man was in error. And I flatly deny that. &gt;&gt; I aggressively deny that. Amen. &gt;&gt; They're speaking about my liberty. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; They're speaking about the redemption. &gt;&gt; Speaking about what God did to my home and my family, to you as an individual, and what I've seen God do. And I won't trade it for anything. [Music] &gt;&gt; Won't trade it for anything. &gt;&gt; What's it done for you, friends? &gt;&gt; Amen. And I don't want anyone to sit here and say tusk tusk. You know, we shouldn't have to speak about these things. You're going to face it and you better pack it and take it as a burden of the word of the Lord this morning. You're going to need this shovel. You're going to need this grenade. You're going to need these bullets sometime. You're going to need this armament. It's given for your safety and for your protection. You'll be able to leave here and stand alone &gt;&gt; if you have to stand on a hill and say, "I've been told and from that morning, from that morning service, I have given myself to to feed on this word." And you'll get some muscles of faith, friends. &gt;&gt; Glory to God. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And here's what Brother Brandham said. I'm closing with this on the seventh seal. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Now, he said when this tape gets out, &gt;&gt; Amen. which it is. That'll probably send 10,000 of my friends &gt;&gt; away from me. &gt;&gt; That's exactly what it did. &gt;&gt; And we're only reading some evidence of it. &gt;&gt; And people who have taken the message themselves and claim to be followers of the message, and I pray they will continue to do so. I pray that they will repent. And that's the only conclusion. It's not just a, you know, we don't just come into unity and say, "Well, we're all nice people." That's not the basis of fellowship. If we walk in the light as he is in the light and he is the light, then we have fellowship one with another. And the blood of Jesus Christ cleanseth us from all sin. That's the basis of fellowship. [Music] &gt;&gt; It'll send 10,000 my friends away from me. Because they're going to say that brother Brandham, here's what they're going to say. That brother Brandham's trying to put himself and make himself a servant or a prophet. &gt;&gt; Now, that's a prophecy. &gt;&gt; They're going to come and say William Brandham's trying to make himself Elijah. &gt;&gt; Or another phrase was the messenger of the covenant. &gt;&gt; And what he said, the messenger of the covenant is Jesus Christ. But let me clear something up. He also said several times he referred to John the Baptist as a messenger of the covenant. Messenger is a messenger. He carries a message. And it was John's. It was John's giving to identify this is him. This is the lamb of God. &gt;&gt; He was the messenger of the covenant. But John was a messenger of the covenant to say this is him. And this was William Brandham's a message of the covenant as well announcing this is the covenant announcing. Listen to me friends. Revelation I feel like preaching now. Revelation 10:1. And I saw another mighty angel. That's the other angel descending from heaven with a rainbow over his head. What is the rainbow? The covenant. descending with the covenant. What is the covenant? The restored word back to the people. And here's the spirit that's trying to get people to believe it was error. I deny that spirit in the name of Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. I'm telling you friends, this is a power that will keep you. This is a power that will keep our young ladies. I can give you a power by the Holy Ghost. I can lead you to a power that will keep you &gt;&gt; pure. &gt;&gt; Keep you &gt;&gt; from falling. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Power that can keep you to walk on the thin edge of the wedge. &gt;&gt; To walk on the razor edge of this generation. &gt;&gt; Amen. And he says, &gt;&gt; and he says this at the end of this paragraph with this I leave it to you. He said, "It may be time. It may be the hour now that this great person &gt;&gt; that we're expecting to rise on the scene &gt;&gt; may rise on the scene. &gt;&gt; Maybe this ministry that I've tried to take people back to the word &gt;&gt; has laid a foundation. And if it has, I'll be leaving you for good. He prophesied his departure. He doesn't need some Pentecostals prophesying his departure. He prophesied it. &gt;&gt; I'll be leaving you soon. [Music] &gt;&gt; I'll be leaving you for good. &gt;&gt; There won't be two of us here at the same time. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Oh, isn't it wonderful? &gt;&gt; It won't be two of us here at the same time. I hope that was clear. I hope it wasn't misunderstood. [Music] [Applause] We give you praise, Lord. We give you praise. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Glory to God. Glory to God. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Come, brother. &gt;&gt; I'd like to sing a verse or two. Behold, what manner of man is this &gt;&gt; that stands between God and man? His eyes are like a flame of fire. His fan is in his hand. &gt;&gt; Behold, what manner of man is this? I want to get to verse four, please. Behold, what manner of man is this who stand between God and man? His eyes are as a flame of fire. His man is in his hand. John in the seven churches and sun. Behold what matter of man is this? Heat. Heat. Heat. Heat. [Music] Heat. Heat. Heat. Heat. Heat. Heat. Heat. Heat. Gracious the everlasting father throughout eternity. [Music] Before we sing, I just want to say to many of you here, I'm well aware of families and family ties. I'm well aware of it. And I don't just stand here today. I had to make my decision for this message many, many years ago. Many years ago. And quite frankly, I was the only one in my family that received it at the time. And number two, my wife was the only one in her family. Was [Music] it easy? [Music] Well, I don't know. We didn't make a big issue of it. [Music] I knew one thing. It was real to me. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And I was just a young man like some of you young people that are here. I'm very, very aware. believe me very aware. And on the other hand, I only know of one solution. I only know of one answer and that is that you yourself must anchor yourself body, spirit, and soul in the word of God that God has made real to you. &gt;&gt; I cannot escape a revelation of the word of God. It became Christ to me. Amen. &gt;&gt; It was not Christ to me in a triangle and this and that one and mother father wherever more I my father when he passed away God bless him. We loved each other so deeply and I I encouraged him to read the church age book and he was reading it. He loved the book of revelation and he had he he he wrote a book in fact called the midnight trump. It was excellent. I only have one copy of it, little tiny book. And and I but what brother Brandham was saying was very different from what he had gathered in his studies. That was not the point. Friends, I wouldn't do my father any damage. I wouldn't speak about your relatives or your friends adversely or wrong in any way. You must just commit them to God. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; As God's children &gt;&gt; because it's not us. We don't put people in or take people out. We don't do that at all. But is it possible for good people to be led astray or persuaded? &gt;&gt; It absolutely is. &gt;&gt; And I'm preaching this for people who've never come in contact with anything. You could be people that could be your friends in the world. Don't you for a second let the friends of the world afflict you. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Not for a second. &gt;&gt; Amen. I'm talking about eternal life. &gt;&gt; I'm talking about eternal life. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I'm talking about he who made all things. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Oh, I love him. &gt;&gt; How glorious he is. &gt;&gt; And if you have anything afflicting you, settle it in your mind right now and here. And all you need to do is say, "Lord, I believe that that was truth that was preached. This was unbiased. This was exposing. And this is speaking truth. &gt;&gt; This is identifying with the message of the hour &gt;&gt; as absolute truth. &gt;&gt; Amen. [Music] &gt;&gt; I can find holes in the Bible. Said you can. Yeah. God said to Moses, don't you make a graven image of any kind that represents anything in heaven. and then tells them go and make two graven make the angels and their wings will touch and put them in the holiest place there is on the mercy seat &gt;&gt; say well did he say it over here what did he mean over here I don't know it's the same God he can say what he wants &gt;&gt; what are we some little puny insignificant as brother Brandon says crawling just like worms crawling on the dry dry uh you know fibers of life. &gt;&gt; Your life might pass away from you today. All God has to do is hold your breath up for a few minutes and you're gone. I'm gone. Then what? &gt;&gt; Then what? &gt;&gt; I can tell you for sure there's only one that you're going to face and that's him who's here present today as the other angel. [Applause] [Music] &gt;&gt; Once more then I'll have John pray. [Music] No wonder man of man is this who stands between God and man. His eyes around his hand in his hand churches brillian Yeah. Heat. [Applause] Heat. Heat. and he's the everlasting father throughout all eternity. Thank you, brothers and sisters. Thank you very much. Appreciate your help, your support, and listening this morning because I didn't know how this service was going to go, but I just let it all out and whatever happens happens. &gt;&gt; God bless you. Brother John, would you pray? And is there anyone here just feels a need God to meet your need right where you're at? Amen. Lord Jesus, we want to give our lives to you, Lord. Most of us weren't privileged to be here 50 years ago in the presence of that seventh angel, but we have been privileged to be in your presence and for your spirit to come in our day. and the same influence and the same atmosphere and the same word has caught our hearts. And Lord, we want to respond appropriately. We want to respond as your wife and as your bride to make herself ready. Cleanse our hearts and our lives today, God. Even at the close of many of the meetings when you'd appear and so many hearts were hardened, so many would stomp out. So many would have different opinions, but they that wait upon the Lord &gt;&gt; shall renew their strength, &gt;&gt; and you would come behind it and vindicate their lives. Lord, would you come behind your elect lady and may the life of Jesus Christ be on display. We cry out for that presence to flow through us, Lord. Making ourselves available and the womb of our lives for your seed to bring forth your token life today, God. At the close of this service, we say we surrender, Lord. &gt;&gt; We receive your mighty voice and the moving of your spirit and what you've done and through the message of the hour to give us a promised land experience. And Lord, we want to fight as Joshua and Caleb. And we want to stand like men and women of faith and drive out the inhabitants of our land and in our personal lives, in our families. We want to go forward in the promises of God. So would you bless every sister and every brother and every man and woman. Bring forth within our hearts the reason that you sent out this mighty voice, &gt;&gt; Lord. May the other angel come behind the word and water it and soak down into our lives what we need today to manifest in these closing moments. Lord, in our right attitude, in the right spirit as you're capping off an elected lady, &gt;&gt; go with every heart and life. And we receive your word in Jesus Christ's name. Amen. Amen. God bless you. And just as we leave, we'll shake hands and greet one another and sing, "Take the name of Jesus with you." &gt;&gt; Amen. Did &gt;&gt; I hear amen? God bless you. You're dismissed in Jesus name. Tearing the name of Jesus with you, child of sorrow and absor. [Music] [Music] Heat. Heat. [Music] Heat. Heat. [Music] Heat. Heat. [Music] Heat. Heat. [Music] might [Music] be the Lord. [Music] Heat. Heat. [Music] [Music]
