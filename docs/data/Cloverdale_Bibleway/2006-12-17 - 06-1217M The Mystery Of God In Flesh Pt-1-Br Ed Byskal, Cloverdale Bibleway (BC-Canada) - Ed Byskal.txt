Amen. &gt;&gt; Thank you for your prayers &gt;&gt; and they have been effectual &gt;&gt; and I think you would like to know that. Amen. So uh we uh got back on earlier this week about Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday long in there seemed like we were traveling a long time. Uh but I want to thank you for especially for your prayers. God answers prayers. &gt;&gt; We have a God who hears. &gt;&gt; We have a God who answers. We have a God who acts. &gt;&gt; Isn't it wonderful? &gt;&gt; Amen. Um we're going to in a moment have a dedication and we're going to dedicate an entire family. It's a great pleasure to me for me to be able to do that. Our brother Chedameir and sister Dankanka are going to have their family dedicated and uh I'm so delighted to do that. Uh brother Chedir, if you will come with your good wife and your children. Amen. Let's just sing Amazing Grace because when I thought of this family, I thought of the Amazing Grace of God. And you'll know why in a moment. Amazing grace. God bless you. And you're going to be baptized. God bless you. I was I was fly. I want to say praise God. Praise God. Praise God. Praise God. Praise God. Praise God. Praise God. Praise God. Praise God. Praise God. Praise God. Praise God. Praise God. Praise God. Praise God. Praise God. Amen. As I thought and meditated upon uh Brother Chedameir and Sister Danka and their family being here today, I immediately thought, Brother Chedare, Sister Danka of the of a long journey that they have made not to come to church this morning so much, but the long journey in coming to where they are day from where they were. And I thought of I thought of brother Chetameir's experience in a bitter bitter conflict of war and being a prisoner and coming out weighing not too many pounds for a man his size and for this woman here to have prayed and prayed and prayed and believed for him and he wasn't a believer yet. he wasn't a Christian yet and that God preserved him out of a horrific conflict in Bosnia and then allowed them to find entrance and the United States opened their arms and received them and they said where where do you want to go? Well, you know, we have a cousin or something in in Lincoln, Nebraska. All right, there you go. and they and and they need a place to fellowship and they need a place to feed and hear the word of God and to raise their children. And that became the search. And I as I thought of you, brother Chedir, I thought this is a son of Abraham and a daughter of Abraham. And one day Abraham was met by another person that was Melzdc. &gt;&gt; And I thought, you have met that same one. You've met him. and he came by your way. You didn't find him, but he found you. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's exactly what happened. And then Abraham, his nature was he was so overwhelmed and overcome by the fact that this great one had come and met him and gave him bread and wine. He didn't have any children. Abraham didn't have anything to offer him. He just gave him tithes of all that he had because that's all he had. He just had some material things. He didn't have any possessions. But what was in the mind of Melzdc was I'm going to give this man a son. I'm going to give him children and I'm going to make him a father of many nations. But Abraham didn't Abraham had that promise but hadn't had anything yet. And now, Brother Chedimir, you live in a home and you drive a car and you have a few material things. But I think God is very pleased that you're coming here this morning to say, "Here's really what we are." &gt;&gt; This is all we have. And this we're going to dedicate to God's service. And God has put that in your heart. And I I believe that God is pleased. The same God that showed himself in Melzdc has come to meet another son of Abraham. And uh and now out of his heart and soul and his wife, they say, "Here we are. This is all we are. This is all we have. But we give it to you." &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. We're going to pray together. Heavenly Father, &gt;&gt; this family that stands here at this sacred moment, &gt;&gt; you have placed something within their hearts, &gt;&gt; not just for this moment, but long ago, and they've desired to give themselves so unreservedly to you. And Lord, you you were speaking to them even in their youth. And Lord, how our sister just sanka prayed and you heard her prayers and you showed her that you were a God that answered prayers. You preserved my precious brother Cheddameir. Lord, you have brought him on a very long journey this family. And now you have prospered them and given them children and they come with their children. even their daughter. Lord, you put it in her heart to be baptized and she'll be baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ this evening. Lord, it will be an eternal work in her life. I pray that you will bless these children with health. Oh God, I pray that you'll bless them with the knowledge of the Lord Jesus Christ in salvation. I pray that you'll bless them with a testimony wherever they are around their friends, around their school friends. Lord, I pray that you'll bless their children, oh God. And especially I ask, oh God, for my brother Cedir, Sister Danka, you'll give them wisdom as they rear up these children. Father, this this will all this day will always be remembered as they dedicate themselves, give themselves to your service. And now, Father, I dedicate them in the name of Jesus Christ. And there will be another gathering when this family will be enlarged, oh God. And they'll gather with the family of God from all nations and tongues and people. And that is why they're standing here today. And on that day, I pray Lord, the circle shall not be unbroken. In Jesus Christ's name. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. God bless you, brother Ched. Amen. &gt;&gt; Bless you, sister. God bless you, children. Bless you, Susanna. Amen. Isn't he wonderful? Amen. &gt;&gt; Well, Brother Dier's parents have been welcomed, but I'd like to welcome you in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ. Welcome to America, North America. Hallelujah. I'm sure your son and daughter-in-law will make you happy. We have another uh someone else I want to remember. Where's Adam Brooks? I heard that Adam Brooks is here. Adam, will you stand up? Where are you? Is he in church this morning? I come to welcome him. I don't see him. Uh he and Angela saw some of our family the other day. And uh Adam, if you're here or in the fellowship room, I don't only want to welcome him here for a short stay. Many of you that know Adam and he grew up here. I remember spending some time with him alone in my study. And he was a boy about 10. And he touched my heart that day as we spoke together. And I saw in that small fellow a man and now he's a man. He's a he's in the armed services and he has to go to Iraq in February. So I pray that he'll come out safely, come home safely. And I for all of you that know Adam Brooks, I I would say I pray that he will come to the knowledge that we're in a greater army than the US Army or any other human army. We're in the army of God. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Well, we before we go to the word, can we just take a couple moments on on Brazil because I know that you're anxious to know we're not going to take a lot of time, but brother Tony arrived in Brazil ahead of myself a couple of days just to finetune arrangements for the meetings and so on. And uh then Thursday evening uh of last week, Brother Tony preached there. And then Friday morning, we made uh two uh television broadcast. The name of the broadcast is Perfect Faith. I thought that was a great name. And uh I don't know all of the details, but uh brother Tony has many more details and perhaps we might be able to be ready on Wednesday and show you more and tell you more details. So we won't take a lot of time right now but uh it's being powerfully effective and I will I will tell you this since its inception what is it about 9 months about nine months that it has been and brother Cesar he did not really anticipate he didn't know what all he knew is that this time was made available for him to go on a national the the it's a Christian broadcasting station, national broadcasting station called Genesis and all the big people are on it as far as you know different denominations and something but to think that the voice of this message and he preaches it fearlessly believe me how he is on there is more than I can even imagine and I'm sure that there's a there's a lot of pressure of foot to have him knocked off and have him taken off but he just blasts word. I mean, it is incredible. And uh they had they've had 3600 over 3600 that's 3,600 phone calls, contacts, letters, phone calls, whatever contact. And these people, they want to they want to have some answers. They want to get a book. They want some details. They're hearing things they've never heard before. And u uh brother Tony had a very rare unusual experience with brother Cesar. I'm going to let him come up and tell that. And and if you would come now, brother Tony. And it's it's touching. You can just imagine. You know, you know who has a lot of questions? Preachers. Yes. Right. &gt;&gt; They got a lot of questions because they're studying weekly and they realize lots of good sincere preachers know that their denomination or what they're serving isn't giving them the answer. And when they hear this, it's some difference. So, brother Tony, if you'd just speak of the experience in the restaurant and also the uh pastor, the Pentecostal pastor. &gt;&gt; Well, God bless you, saints. Indeed. U the broadcast of brother Cesar is reaching out in many ways and uh you know with the work of God it's always what you don't see that is so amazing and uh and so as we uh brother Ed was mentioning brother Cesar and I we were just uh winding up in an evening and we went to a restaurant to have a bite to eat and we're just standing at the buffet table just kind of going around and this man just kind of rushes up to brother Cesar and uh and just thrusts his hand right right to him and say, "Pastor, pastor, uh, Cesar," he says. And then he began to speak to him in in Portuguese, and I didn't understand what was going on, but uh, this man's eyes began to well up with tears. And as I understood afterwards from listening to brother Cesar, and we stood at this at this buffet table for like five almost 10 minutes, and this p this man would just point out his heart to pastor Cesar. And the essence of it was was here he was a doctor in the city of Jean Pasoa and he was a Christian and he had been uh he had discovered the TV broadcast of Feeta and he'd been watching it without fail and he wanted to uh to to step further in obedience to the word of God and when he saw brother Cesar and I at the at the restaurant there he was convicted in his heart. He knew that brother Biscll and I were there for special meetings on the weekend. And he said, "I want you to know how much your program has blessed me. I know I'm not baptized, right? I know I haven't been walking uh correctly in the light of God's word." He said, "Your broadcast helps me so much." He said, "I am coming Sunday because I want to be rebaptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ." &gt;&gt; Praise God. Amen. And you know that if one man comes in a situation like that, how many hundreds, how many thousands around the nation that don't have a chance to to meet brother Cesar and to speak to him are being affected around the country. &gt;&gt; And that happens uh when I was there in in uh in October for the dedication and uh we went to check in at the hotel that brother Bisl and I were staying at. the very man that was there checking us in. As soon as he saw brother Cesar, he just began to speak to him and said, "I saw your broadcast. I watch it every day." And then again, even another incident on this trip was that we went to a a place of business and another woman just came right up and said, "I I watch your broadcast. It's such a blessing." And so, it was uh tremendously encouraging to be able to have these experiences and and know that this is a great effectual open door. We don't know how long it's going to last, but I tell you what, saints, there's a there's a stir going on in Brazil, not only amongst individuals, but there was a pastor that also uh is representative of numerous pastors. Uh brother Cesar has sent out church age books to several hundred pastors that are watching this broadcast and hearing things that they've never heard for the first time. and several pastors uh ministers that have been watching and and have been moved upon and have taken us deeper step of faith. Uh one of them was brother Henriki from the city of Macio. He drove 750 kilometers just to be in these meetings for this weekend. There was women, two women, two ladies in the capital city of Brazilia, which is about a 3hour flight. That would be like as far away as as Manitoba. and hearing the broadcast, knowing that an eyewitness or the prophet was going to be in the meetings. She and her daughter flew out to be in these meetings. Unfortunately, we didn't get a chance to meet them, but we did have uh interviews with three other pastors, and we're going to maybe show that to you on Wednesday. And this pastor, Henriki, he uh he's uh living in a slum area of the city, but yet he's over four churches, and he's bringing these churches into the deeper things of the word of God. So, just a little little anticipation of uh of what we're going to have for you on Wednesday. And uh of course, brother Cesar sends his love and greetings and uh even gave a little gift to brother Ed. I don't know, he'll say maybe more about that. So, God bless you. Thank you, brother. Uh the pastor that brother Tony just speaks of that is over four churches was a Pentecostal pastor and he just his wife saw the broadcast and his wife said to him, "Dear, you need to listen to this man. You should hear this man." And soon as he heard him, it just gripped. And not only that, his eyes were just open. It was like scales fell from his eyes and he could not let go of it. And he just pursued he's been absorbing the message with an incredible intense hunger. And it you can you can you can only answer it by saying it's a sovereign work of almighty God. Amen. I have just a short clip DVD clip. You can see a little bit of the church. if they'll just show that just now just uh like about two minutes shows the church and then brother Cesar uh welcomes myself to the pull pit and then he comes forward I just tell you this because we don't have interpretation and has the people stand in the church that uh that came just locally as a result of the uh broadcast and the reason we say that is because uh the people of this congregation you have made that broadcast possible for this first year. And these are the fruits of your labors as well. picture is a the church is built on a steep hillside so they have underground parking. music and then otherwise go Yes. I'd like you to know that there are many people here. You were blessed by the broadcast on TV. &gt;&gt; I want to ask them and you be a witness. How many people are coming to the message like ask this morning. Please stand up. Praise God. &gt;&gt; So I want you to see some part of this. &gt;&gt; Yes. Yes. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Thank you, brother Cesar. That was about half the congregation that you saw because they couldn't pan the rest of it. So you saw about half the church. This church seats 1050 people and uh it was packed to the walls. Uh they were out in the foyer and everywhere else. Well, we praise the Lord for that. &gt;&gt; Just want to make sure we're not forgetting anything. Do you rejoice in these things? &gt;&gt; Amen. Let's stand to our feet and we're going to open our Bibles please to Colossians the first chapter and we'll begin to read at the first verse. Before we do, we'll ask the Lord's blessing upon the word. Dear father God, so many times we do not know all that you are doing. We are simply walking by faith. We're simply trusting you. And today, once again, we have gathered here, Lord, all that are here within this congregation, within the walls of these this building, but Lord, the uh the audience, Father, that you have also uh allowed us to come into their homes, into their rooms, into their churches, wherever it may be. this uh the invisible audience. Lord, we are greeting them in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and we're thanking you for the body of Jesus Christ, the bride of Jesus Christ. And Lord, the opportunity to stand once again and to declare your gospel, to declare your truth that you have given us, we will do so with all the strength and the courage that you shall give us. Instill within each of us, Lord, that kind of hunger, Lord Jesus, that you spoke about when you said these words, "Blessed are ye that hunger and thirst after righteousness, for you shall be filled." We want to be those that are filled today, Lord. And so we will be those that hunger. Create within us a great heart, Lord, to hunger and thirst after you. Bless all that are within the sound of my voice today in the name of Jesus Christ by the Holy Spirit. Breathe upon us, I pray, for your glory. And we'll thank you for it. Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. I thank the Lord. Amen. &gt;&gt; For the things that he has done, I say, "Praise God for the family of God. Healings that I've heard, supernatural healings which have just taken place. I thank God for it from the depths of my heart." We're going to read from the first verse, Colossians 1, down to verse 6, and then we'll start at verse 15. Paul an apostle of Jesus Christ by the will of God in Tim Timoththeus our brother to the saints notice it's to the saints and faithful brethren in Christ which are at Colasse grace be unto you and peace from God our father and the Lord Jesus Christ we give thanks to God and the father of our Lord Jesus Christ praying always for you since we heard of your faith in Christ Jesus and of the love which you have to all the saints for the hope which is laid up for you in heaven whereof you heard before in the word of the truth of the gospel which is come unto you and as we read this sixth verse I want you to think of even this vast nation of Brazil which we just journeyed to and have returned which has come unto you as it is in all the world, and bringeth forth fruit, as it doth also in you. And since the day you heard of it, and knew the grace of God in truth. Verse 15, who is the image of the invisible God, the firstborn of every creature. For by him were all things created, that are in heaven and that are in earth, visible and invisible, whether they be thrones or dominions or principalities or powers. All things were created by him and for him. And he is before all things, and by him all things consist. And that really means in him all things have been permanently placed. Amen. &gt;&gt; In him all things consist. They have been permanently placed in him. For it pleased the Father that in him should all fullness dwell. and down to verse 24. Who now rejoice in my sufferings for you, and fill up that which is behind of the afflictions of Christ in my flesh for his body's sake, which is the church, whereof I am made a minister, according to the dispensation of God, which is given to me for you to fulfill the word of God, even the mystery. Notice if it please as we finish the 25th verse this dispensation of God which was given to the Apostle Paul for you for the church to fulfill the word of God even the mystery which was which hath been hid from ages and from generations but now is made manifest to his saints to whom God would make known what is the riches of the glory of this mystery among the Gentiles, which is Christ in you, the hope of glory whom we preach. What are they preaching? They're preaching the mystery of Christ in you. That's what and and notice it says which is Christ in you, the hope of glory. The hope of glory. And then Apostle Paul says whom we preach. So it's a person he's preaching. The mystery, the mystery of Christ in you is a person. He's speaking that even this great mystery whom we preach. &gt;&gt; It's Christ that's being preached and he is that mystery of the indwelling in the believer whom we preach warning every man and teaching every man in all wisdom that we may present every man perfect in Christ Jesus where unto I also labor striving according to his working which workketh in me mightily. God bless his word and bless you as you have your seats. We've been rather long with the preliminaries, but uh uh this is the Lord's day &gt;&gt; and this is his place of worship. Now the apostle Paul, he's declaring that he's a minister according to the dispensation or that season uh the dispensation of God which had been given to him to fulfill the word of God as I said a moment ago to fulfill the word of God even the mystery which hath been hid from ages and from generations. Now I want to take you into some slides immediately uh and uh just be a little bit patient here with us because I want to I have a number of slides that will set the basis for the for the message and I won't likely finish uh today but now this first slide is is on the scripture Even the mystery which hath been hid from ages and from generations. Notice from ages and generations because we're going to go into that in just a moment. But now is made manifest. didn't say it was completed, but it's being made manifest to his saints. Not to everyone, but to his saints. And to whom God would make known what is the riches of the glory of this mystery, which is Christ in you, the hope of glory. And I would like to I want to address something this morning that is uh doesn't merely intrigue me but captivates my thought. This thought of Christ in you not only the hope of glory but God in flesh is something that I have a hard time comprehending. God in flesh, you know, and and sometimes we cringe at that because we're so conscious of our flesh, but Jesus said, you know, I'm in the Father and the Father's in me and I'm in you. &gt;&gt; Well, I don't know. Do we water that down? &gt;&gt; Is Christ diluted somehow? Is he something less in me than he is outside of me? is and in this scripture speak uh several times of of the spirit of God which dwelleth in you and don't you know &gt;&gt; the scripture says don't you know I'm putting it in our vernacular don't you know that you're the temple of the Holy Ghost &gt;&gt; which dwelleth in you well now does is it am I to understand that somehow from the time that's spoken or from wherever the spirit of God is till it permeates my being. It is diluted. It is watered down. It is weakened. It is made something different. Or am I to assume that it is indeed the spirit of God that enters into a person causes them to be a son of God and that there's no attribute, there's nothing that is lessened, there's nothing that is weakened. It is full strength God coming into an individual. That's very very very intriguing for me. Captivating. I'm mesmerized by that thought. &gt;&gt; God in flesh. &gt;&gt; There's a lot of the community out there will tell you, "Ah, that's the first sign of a cult." &gt;&gt; If that's a sign of a cult, I want to be part of that cult. &gt;&gt; I want to be part of those that can believe unto having God in flesh. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And I don't know what they do with all of these scriptures which we're going to be giving you today. Ages and this is in the Greek. Now I have some Greek and some Hebrew. So ages aon perpetuity of time. It is eternity. It is forever. It is the worlds or h can have reference to the worlds in the universe. And so the apostle Paul has the audacity to declare even to apostles who have who have walked with the Lord Jesus Christ. But he's able to say God has held this for all of the per perpetuity of time for all this eternity without beginning without end. Of course, that's what this word can mean forever. The world's the universe and he said and and generations. That which has been uh generations. I'm sorry. Don't know why the first part didn't come up. generations which is Gina Gina and that is that which has been begotten has been begotten men of the same stock. In other words, Paul is saying this this is not only a time element that this has been hidden, but this is also concerns peoples, nations of peoples, that which has been begotten by man, that men of the same sort, the whole multitude of men living at the same time. He's saying this has been hidden. &gt;&gt; This has been completely hidden. This has not been made known, &gt;&gt; but now it's being made manifest. &gt;&gt; And that same God can have and this have the same effect and saying these things that have been sealed in the seven seals. They've been sealed and you can put the same application to it. They've been sealed throughout all of this time. nations and the whole begotten of mankind and all of the peoples of the earth and the intelligencia and all of this all the hierarchy and whatever more it's been hidden &gt;&gt; and Paul could say it's been hidden because he also would continue to speak and it would be made known it would be open and it is open does do does everyone understand it? No, everyone doesn't understand it but that doesn't mean it hasn't been opened. It has been made open. It's been it has been it has been made uh it's been made known now. And God said, "Let us make man in our image, after our likeness, in our image, and after our likeness. And let them have dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the fowl of the air, and over the cattle, and over all the earth, and over every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth." So God created man in his own image in the image of God created he him male and female created he them. Now it was the image that was lost in Eden. And it is the image that this struggle that is taking place over this what we call the earth is a struggle over the image. I just I want to make these statements to you. It's a struggle over the image because the scripture which we began to read said who is the image of the invisible God. God said in the beginning that he would make an image. The the mystery is the image of God cannot be reestablished on the earth unless God can dwell in these human vessels. Without God being in flesh, there's no way he's going to be able to establish his image. And the and and the the real uh the struggle and the turmoil and the battle that is taking place literally on the earth is Satan wants to establish not only his kingdom but his image in that kingdom. And God has established his domain, his control, and he's he's taking possession of this. Not only the mankind, but the earth as well. &gt;&gt; So God created man in his own image, in the image of God created he he him. Male and female created he them. It seems to me that God wanted to make certain there was no mistake because in these two verses he has made so many references. Let us make man in our image and after our likeness and let them have dominion etc. So God created man in his own image and in the image of God created he him. Male and female created he them. Now I want you to notice there's a difference between uh in verse 26 and verse 27. In verse 26 the word for make is the Hebrew word assa and the Hebrew word for create in verse 27 is the word barah. And they are they are different in their in their meanings. The Hebrew word for make assa means to mold or make something from existing materials. I want you to hold that now. And the word bear or for create in verse 27 is to create something new out of nothing. &gt;&gt; Man is a unique creature. Yes, &gt;&gt; the believer is a unique creature. Now, the believer, the believer, so many of the things that brother Brandham has said as a prophet of God should be going through your mind at this time, and I shouldn't have to draw actually pictures for it, but when you hear him say that we have a a gene of God, the believer, and when the spirit of God strikes that germmitized seed, that's something that came to you out of nothing. But you are, we are a unique being. We're sitting here in bodies of flesh that God has allowed to come up out of the soil of the earth. Your body came up out of the soil. No mystery. It's going back to the dust, dust to dust, ashes to ashes. But what's inside? God took something from existing materials to make a body, to form a body. But that's really not what the believer is. The believer has something that was that came not out of anything that exists. It came out of and there's something very very unique and wonderful here because it also has a a a meaning in the in the Hebrew uh word for image is it is as something that is has been cut off. not cut off or separated but something that is a part of something else. And so in the Hebrew when it talks about the image of God, it is something that has come off of an original piece, something that has been cut off. That is why the scripture speaks of Jesus that he came from the bosom of the father. He's come from the bosom of the father. We we saw and he there was a a body that was made and taken because he took a body of flesh and that body came from the existing materials. But with what was in him isn't something that came from anything that existed. &gt;&gt; He was God in the flesh. And we have to see that. And and I'd like to emphasize that because I would like you to ponder that because Apostle Paul is directing his words to the Colossians by saying that's the mystery that has been hidden. And I would say Satan has worked fulltime 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, 365 a year to try to cloud that issue and try and take that out of the believer and try and and make that a confusion until he succeeds in having people to believe, ah, stay away from that because that's the first sign of a cult. I'll have you know if you don't believe that, you're lost. &gt;&gt; If you don't believe that God by his spirit comes into you and makes you a son of God by the spirit of God and that God is in your flesh, you can you you can in no wise come into your inheritance. &gt;&gt; Can you believe that? Amen. &gt;&gt; So God created man in his own image in the image of God created he him. So out of out of all God created and made man is both molded from existing material also created out of no known existing material. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. I'm glad to be able to stand here and say today, there's a part of me that didn't come from anything that man knows as a material. Nothing that's an existing material, the great spirit of God, eternal spirit of God has come to dwell in these earthn vessels. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And that's what makes us really what we are. &gt;&gt; It is that spirit. It is that element. And I cannot understand it. I can't describe it to you. I don't know how it happens. But God, we baptize people in water in an element. &gt;&gt; We take these bodies of flesh which came out of the elements. That's the part that came from that which is uh- which is material which which existed. And we take that body and put it into that into the tank as as a representation that they're going down into a burial and they buried in the with Christ in his in his death. But when he raised in the resurrection, the life that was in Christ, you know, uh let me say it this way. the life that was in Christ while he walked on earth, while he suffered for sin and while he suffered in his humanity, but that that life that was in him, which was God in flesh. Will you agree with that? &gt;&gt; That life took dominance because it was the spirit of God which raised him from the dead. So the spirit of God raised the material. What what the what was made a body in a woman came into the earth and was laid in the tomb. That body was not there when Peter went to the tomb. &gt;&gt; That body had raised &gt;&gt; and the angel said, "Why seek ye the living among the dead? He has risen and that body was raised and changed." So that life that was in him was taking dominance over that body that was made out of the existing material. Hallelujah. And that which is in you which had no beginning and had no end, as sure as this Bible stands before us today, that life will take dominance over this one. Hallelujah. We have been cut off the great masterpiece. We're part of a great masterpiece. We've been broken off of that piece. Hallelujah. We came from God and we'll go back to God. &gt;&gt; Glory. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; In the future home, I love these quotes. You are part of the earth. Your body and your soul is a part of God. &gt;&gt; An attribute of God displayed here on earth in a body. &gt;&gt; And the body is to be redeemed. Now the soul's redeemed. It is redeemed now. You are redeemed &gt;&gt; because it was in because it was in sin. So God came down by the process of justification and sanctification and the baptism of the Holy Ghost and redeemed your soul and you being a part of the earth. That's where the material that existed. It's redeemed by it. You're in that. You're in the process now. It's going on. In other words, your body which came from existing materials is in the process of redemption. It's in the process that God has. But your soul has already your soul stepped ahead of the body. Your soul is already redeemed. We are redeemed. &gt;&gt; Thank God. Let the let the redeemed say so. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And don't be ashamed of it. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; If anyone can rejoice, it's you that can rejoice. You're in the process now. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. I'm in the process now. &gt;&gt; That's what the scripture is telling us. &gt;&gt; Image. Now, this is the Hebrew. Salem is the pronunciation. It is a likeness or a resemblance. Let us make man in our image. Let us make man in our likeness. Let him resemble us a piece of the original. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; You see, when God took him and formed even the body and brother Brandham speaks of God's a spirit. We were first a spirit man in our original state and then God breathed into that as Rabbi Richmond uh stood here and I think he thought he was going to shock the people by saying let me say that that breath that God breathed into man can never sin. And the congregation that was here, probably 8, 900 people that crowded night, all said in big unison, "Amen." They can never sin. How can the breath of God that's breathed into that never came from a substance? &gt;&gt; Glory to God. How can that ever sin? It can never sin. It came right out of the bosom of God, the breath of God. Do you know that this word came by the same process? This came by the breath of God. It came through man. God breathed through man. And when he breathed through man, it came out in word form. &gt;&gt; And that word was God. &gt;&gt; In the beginning was the word. &gt;&gt; And the word was God. And that word was made what? &gt;&gt; Flesh. &gt;&gt; And dwelt among us. &gt;&gt; It was the word in flesh. Hallelujah. And now the breath of God has breathed out the spoken word. And we have believed that word into our very being. And that that word is God. &gt;&gt; And he brings his spirit into that word to make it alive. &gt;&gt; It's not a lot of dos and don'ts. It's not a whole bunch of things that you do say, "Well, this how we dress or this is how we act." It's way beyond that. &gt;&gt; And that life, you have to have that life in you first. If you're having a struggle, if you're having a struggle with your conduct, let me say to you, whether it's young people or older, whoever you are, if you have a struggle with your conduct, you believe and let that life of God, you hunger after him and let that life of God take domination in you and those other things will drop away &gt;&gt; like the man or even brother Brandham had. and he refrained from being baptized because he smoked. &gt;&gt; Don't worry about that. Get baptized and the smoke will drop off. &gt;&gt; The world will drop away. &gt;&gt; Don't sit there and try to wrestle with it in your own strength. You haven't got the wisdom to handle it. You haven't got the strength to handle it. But go to death &gt;&gt; and he'll die. Let the old man die. There's baptism tonight. If you've not been baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and come to the waters, be baptized and let the Holy Spirit because of your obedience come into you. Let that part that did not come from a material that didn't come from anything that existed. It come out of the out of the very bosom of God Almighty. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; I want the congregation to say amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Say second to this preacher. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; A piece from the original. I love that. From the root word. Something that has been cut off. Something that has been designed from the um original masterpiece. And they the reason why it's cut off is a a man takes a stalk just a piece of wood, a tree, and he cuts a piece off. And from that peace, he shapes what? The image that's in his mind. Well, God had an image in his mind. I was praying for some healing this morning for some individuals and my prayer was this. God, the picture you had in your mind, surely I have a right to claim that picture, &gt;&gt; that was your thought of that individual. And I claim that picture. I claim that image. I claim that icon for that individual. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; We certainly have a right for that. In the image in the Greek is the icon. A you fellas that run you girls that run computers is full of icons. You click on this icon and click an act. What is it? It's an image of something else. You click on it and then whatever whatever happens in the computer world but in the image in the Bible and he is the image of the invisible God. He's the icon &gt;&gt; of the invisible God. I hope you don't think it's sacrilegious but the woman touched the icon &gt;&gt; and her blood issue was dried up. &gt;&gt; She got the right touch &gt;&gt; at the right person. and received what she had a need of faith. The prophet says, and we're going to get into it in a few moments, that this body which we have, which came out of the physical, material, existing part of the earth, oh my, I hope you can linger long enough and mentally allow your minds to reach out into the great unknown and vast and believe what God's prophet said. He said, "This old star, I call it, I got the quote later on. I may come to it. This earth, this old star, do you believe what I'm saying? &gt;&gt; Do you believe it? this old star that spun out there in a a great vast universe. He said maybe dropped spun out there for hundreds of millions or billions of years and spinning out there in space and stops and some gases form and then it then it maybe goes on another part of the journey. We can't we can't fully describe it. But yet you're sitting here and all of you know science declares to you that these universe was they think it's still expanding going out there and that there's billions of galaxies, billions of them. They they thought there was only three some years ago and now they can't even they can't even begin to grasp and man is struggling to try to understand this creation and this universe and this this great expanse of nothingness out there. And here we are. Here we are like a a a few worms of life &gt;&gt; on one special globe. But a prophet comes says it's the womb for his seed. Who's going to dispute that? And here we are all living creatures and on an earth that's full of life and full of existence and everything else is vast waste, nothing. And God put one thing spinning here and a prophet come says it spun for maybe a hundred billion years and some gases formed and then it was wrapped around maybe the sun or whatever more for some more billions and billions of light years of space and some calcium formed. He said he was making you. &gt;&gt; Now friends, I got something to say today. Two things right now. Number one, I believe that. &gt;&gt; And number two, if that is so, you've been a long time coming. &gt;&gt; And some people have disregard for this body that they're in. And I would say if God had that in his mind for all those billions and billions of years, bringing you up to this place, his intent is to dwell in you somehow. &gt;&gt; He didn't bring your body here just to be a nothing, &gt;&gt; just to be a waste wilderness, just to be something that the devil can entice people to pump full of all kinds of garbage and trash. That's why he say he that destroys a body, this temple is the body of the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; The amen's got quieter. &gt;&gt; I'm not talking about the food that you eat. That's up to you. But I'm saying one thing. You're here in the house of God. And I'm here to tell you that God gave you the body that you're that you're seated in today sitting here listening to this word because he want to dwell in it. &gt;&gt; He want to glorify himself in it. He wants to speak through it. He wants to look through your eyes. He wants to have complete dominance. He wants to have the preeminence in this body. He wants you to open your lips. He wants you to say, "Praise be to God." &gt;&gt; He wants you to use these lungs. He wants you to use your strength. He wants you to see is there somebody I can serve? Is there somebody something I can do for God? And this is not a me me gospel. This is what can I do for someone else? &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And you'll be criticized for it. I am. I'm criticized all the time, for trying to get the message out, trying to translate it into other tongues. I tell you one thing, there's a scripture I'm going to preach on it someday. I've been pondering it for a very long time. It's one of my favorites. And and they criticized a woman who poured out the alabaster box on Jesus. And they said, "What is this waste? To them it was a waste. &gt;&gt; Jesus said, "Don't trouble her." &gt;&gt; And I love this phrase &gt;&gt; for me. It's the phrase of the bride of Christ in this church. She hath done what she could. &gt;&gt; That touches me so deep. &gt;&gt; I have prayed when I cross over and I intend to see brother Brennham. I intend to see the Lord Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; I intend to be with you people &gt;&gt; providing you intend to be there also and by his grace when I come to these that will be I'll be gathered and we'll be gathered to those that were gathered with who gave us this message gave us this uh abundance of spiritual food in due season. &gt;&gt; I want to just be able to say those words. and did what we could. We did what we could. That's what I want to be able to say. I lived the life that we could. Spent the energy and did what we could. I want Jesus to be able to say, "You did what you could. Leave her alone. She has done what she could." &gt;&gt; Those are precious words to me. &gt;&gt; Precious words. And I'm prepared to do anything we can &gt;&gt; to get the thing that has brought us to where we are &gt;&gt; into somebody else's hands. &gt;&gt; I had the experience, again, doesn't happen all that often. Brother Tony was there, myself, two senior pastors, and they looked across that little table where we had had something to eat. And they said through their interpreter, young man, 27, same age I was when I met Brother Brandham, they said, "You speak English. You have the whole message. We don't have it. You've had all these experiences. You've been with the prophet. You've been with him. You've seen how he how he speaks and how he acts. And we want you to know that you're responsible. God gave you that. And they asked me, "Do you think that God gave you that? Why do you think God gave you that? Why do you think God allowed you to have those experiences?" And I was just quiet because quite frankly at my age, I just want to fade off into and be put out to pasture. They said, "You're responsible. We don't have that opportunity. We don't understand. we don't we don't have it. They were just like coming across the table. We don't have it in our language. Broke my heart. I was just I was about speechless, wasn't I, Brother Tony? I didn't say anything. Brother Tony never said hardly a word. That's why I can't sit here and just sit on our laurels and be coasting along and things are fine with me and I got a car and I got my job and I got my this and I got my that. That won't get us anywhere. &gt;&gt; And you maybe you say, "Well, I want to, you know, get out and do great things." I'll tell you one thing. when a congregation of people God Almighty has seen that thousands and tens of thousands and I don't care what people say well there aren't going to be great things that's not a that's not a statement that carries any weight with me I if we have it to cover the whole nation if we have to broadcast or or send out message books or do whatever we have to do to get one &gt;&gt; I think it would be the greatest honor If we could rise at the great supper table and said Cloverdale by the way the saints there were so gripped so so uh uh yes gripped so possessed of this uh character and this nature they brought in the last one. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Bring in the last one. &gt;&gt; Send out the word. Amen. &gt;&gt; I asked brother Dioa, "How do you get all these books out through the rich people?" No. He said, "Even the Sunday school children?" That was the first thing out of his lips. The Sunday school children just give a little bit and maybe give a book. What about you children? Have you ever thought of Brother Biscar ever speaks this way? Have you ever thought What about young people that go down to Starbucks and spend $4 or5? Have you ever thought what $4 or5 dollars will do in the in offering? &gt;&gt; Want to think about that? And you go the next day and the next day and the next day go to McDonald's $67. You don't think anything about it. Go out and fill your car full of gas $450 and you have a job. What do you think about? Say, "Well, I I pay my tithe." What about what about even something sacrificial? &gt;&gt; I'd like to bring those people to you and have them look into your eyes. I said, "You're lucky. You're so fortunate. You understand English. What? What grace? What what gift? What did you do to earn that you're able to speak that language?" And so, well, it just comes so easy. We're indebted. &gt;&gt; We're indebted. &gt;&gt; And I can only do more I can only do more than we're doing right now. My wife was worried for me because the airlines and the air airport controllers had some kind of dispute and concern struggle with the government. So I I sat in two airports for 17 hours. I wasn't even going to mention it. Do you know why it's not worth mentioning? not worth mentioning. It's absolutely nothing for me. It's absolutely nothing. Sit there 17 hours, that's nothing. We're able to go and tell and see somebody and hold their hand and say, you know, we'll do what we can. You think of the energy that's expended. Then, Brother Tony wanted to come home with me real bad. I knew he did, but there was things that were needed. And I tell you, you you you should have seen the panic that was on to try to get to another place. And here our plane is late coming into Rio and he needs to go to another city, Kiba. And there's a kind of a lastm minute thing. And so he gets his flight rearranged, etc., etc. But now the flight's late and he knows for sure his bag won't get on that flight and he's only there for 24 hours and he's on his way back home. But he imperative to be down there. So he called and got a man that could speak English, a steward on the plane said, you know, I'm going to Kachiba. My my bag my bag is on this plane. And the man says, "I'll I'll I'll see you as we land and I'll go with you and we'll get the bag transferred over over to the other gate." And that man came up. He was so accommodating and so nice and came up and had his radio, whatever more off the plane with brother Tony. as I walked off the plane going to my gate there, brother Tony with the people and they're, you know, they got some ground staff there and they're letting the people know, get this bag and get it on the down the other gate so it can go to Kiba and I have to go and get my bag and recheck it again. And you don't hardly have anybody can speak your language, I'll tell you really in a difficult place. And I was uh standing there and everybody's bag went off went off and finally only me and two other young fellas standing there and my bag wasn't coming off and I said I bowed my head and I said, "Lord Jesus, let my bag come off this plane. Let my bag come down on this carousel." And just a couple of moments here come my bag out. I said, 'Oh, praise the Lord.' And I looked at one. I thought I recognized it behind it was Brother Tony's. This bag's supposed to be another gate, supposed to be in a domestic, supposed to go to another place. And I thought, surely that's not brother Tony's. I grabbed it and I ran along and looked at the tag, Anthony Abma. I said, "Oh my goodness. Now, what do we do?" You &gt;&gt; might say, "What has this got to do with the gospel?" This is part of the gospel. Paul told you about being shipwrecked. He told you about going to an island. Told you about a bug that came out on his flesh and put it in the fire. Told you about all kinds of things. How long he was there. &gt;&gt; Told you all kinds of difficulties that he went through. These are just some of the difficulties. Do you do you en do you enjoy it? Well, no, but you don't mind it either because it's all part of the gospel. It's part of getting it out. &gt;&gt; And there's no staff. And just at that same instant, I see a fellow from the airline that I came off of going across. And I went and got a hold of him. I said, "Do you speak English?" I said, "This bag is supposed to go to Kibba." This bag. Oh, okay. You go to Kiba. No, no, no, no. I'm not going. My friend is going. I said, "My colleague." He didn't understand. My friend, my friend, this bag is my bag. This bag's my friend's bag has to go to Kachiba. Okay. Gets on his radio and next day Tony called me said, "Did you get your bag?" "Oh, yeah." I said, "Just work perfect." He says, "Those people were so accommodating. It was just wonderful." I said, "That they were accommodating, but that isn't how your bag got there." &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. That's all part of getting the gospel and doing what you don't want to do and going someplace maybe you don't want to. I want to go home. I want to be with my wife. I want to do. But the gospel calls. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. The burden calls. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; A lot of people today coming up to this Christmas season are going to get caught up in a pagan holiday. They're going to spend a whole lot more money than they should. going to be left with credit card bills at the end that they they said it's such a such a sad state of affairs. I I look at them all and I feel sorry for the people are being torn to all to shreds running all over the place getting this stuff. I tell you what, I think one of the finest things a person could do is give somebody you want to give somebody a gift. Say, I sent a 100 church agents out for you. Well, I'm off my subject, but and yet I'm not off my subject. &gt;&gt; How are they going to be made? How are they going to be formed? How are these people going to be formed into the image of God? And some sit back. I've heard comments from supposed to be real deep message believers and are just so happy they got MP3s and they got this kind of book and that kind of book and they got walls lined with it and we say, "Well, what about those?" Well, even if they just got one, that'll be enough. Can you imagine that kind of statement? Even if they just got one, that'll be enough. And I thank God that since the thing was set up in Brazil, that's 190 million people in Brazil, friends. 190 million people. It's a moving country. It's a vast, vast nation. And I wouldn't even be talking say, "Why are you talking about Brazil?" Because God opens the door &gt;&gt; and God put people together. I didn't do that. I didn't even know these people. Never heard their name. until and they lay hold of you. Now listen, it it's not me as an individual. They're they're holding on to you. They're seeing you. They've seen you on the internet and they know people's names, those who come up and pray and those who preach. And I got an email the other day from Switzerland and listed everybody that preaches. for brother John Adney and brother Tony Abma and brother Lance Laroo and brother Dier and brother Tom Ray and brother Ed Biscll and even I think some others on there. Thank them for me. Thank the congregation. We are believers over here. They don't have a church but we sit and we've been listening for the last year and a half. &gt;&gt; I say glory be to God. &gt;&gt; You think I should be silent? I can't be silent. This thing isn't in my mouth. It's in my soul. It's in my very bosom. It's in my every fiber of my body. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And I've tried to give an example to this people, to this congregation. And we This is a whole nature of the gospel. If we got time for other things, we got time for God. We got money for other things, we got money for God. What about sacrifice? &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen. &gt;&gt; Glory to God. &gt;&gt; For whom he did know. Now, here's some scriptures that I'm going to give you. For whom he did know? He also did predestinate to be I'd like the congregation to say it. Conformed to the image of his son. What did he do? He predestinated that. He determined that. When did he determine that? When this old star was spinning off billions of light years of space, creating a little bit of a a little bit of uh potach or or something else to say, well, that's way beyond my mind. It's not beyond God's mind. That's what he did. And he was and he had in his mind then you as an individual. Brother Brandham says one place that you're not only a thought, but he says he he had to create the thought. &gt;&gt; Amen. I say you are a long time coming &gt;&gt; friends and I believe that about every one of you. If you have the if you have the courage to believe I am that son of God. I am that daughter of God. I have the courage to believe along with you. I say God bless you brother Vile. God bless you brother Dan. God bless you sisters. God bless you in the name of Jesus Christ. I'd like to go off the scene saying God bless you. God ordained that you would be the image of Jesus Christ here on earth. &gt;&gt; But we all with open face beholding as in a glass the glory of the Lord are changed. You believe that? &gt;&gt; We're changed. &gt;&gt; You might not see it. You maybe don't feel it. And I suppose you don't. I don't perhaps maybe feel it at your weakest moment. That's not what the scripture says. The scripture doesn't say you're changed if you feel it. You're changed if everything's going all right. You're changed if you feel upbeat. You're changed if you're of a positive nature. Has nothing to do with that. You are changed from glory to glory. &gt;&gt; Glory to God. That's the word of God. The breath of God is speaking. Friends, I'm speaking this word. This is the breath of God &gt;&gt; to you whether you want to receive it or not. &gt;&gt; You're changed into what? &gt;&gt; Same image. &gt;&gt; Let everyone who believes it say it. Same image. &gt;&gt; Whose image? &gt;&gt; The very image of Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; He was the icon &gt;&gt; of God. And you are his icon. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; You are his image. &gt;&gt; Glory to God. &gt;&gt; You're the icon of Jesus Christ. This word is either true or it's a lie. I say it is true. &gt;&gt; I don't care what kind of a day you had yesterday, what kind of a week you had last week. &gt;&gt; And as you believe it and as you see it and as you as you walk in it, friends, it will change how you walk. Some of you have been I know you have you've been trying to change yourself. You've been trying to make make yourself into that image. You can never come into that image. You have no strength. You have no ability. You haven't got enough will. You don't have enough determination. It's God's will. &gt;&gt; According to his will. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; I'm just going to take a few more minutes. I stepped up here at 11:30 and I'm going to close at 12:30. We're changed into the same image. Notice these out of the future home. Remember that the Holy Ghost descended on Jesus which was a part of the earth. Why? The germ of God, the life of God was designed in the womb of a woman, which was the earth. The woman was the earth. Oh, I'd like you to see if you could just please give me your whole attention for the next few minutes. As we're coming to a close, this earth that God allowed to this old star he allowed to spin off into space. He had in his mind that he create certain elements, certain substances. He knew what he was going to do. And out of those substances which laid in the earth for maybe hundreds of billions of years and he knew there'd be a great war, a great conflict. And who who knows when Lucifer was created? I don't know. But he was created and he raised up and he said, "I'll ascend." He wanted to get a position that was not his position and was cast out to the earth. &gt;&gt; When I don't know, but he ended up in Eden. But here out of the earth, God is taking these elements and he he brings forth a man and he's he's Adam, the first Adam, a son of God. But before he was even formed out of the element of the earth, God had brought forth out of himself cut off a piece as it were and made this piece God of the earth. out of non-existent materials and then took the existing materials and breathed into it. And from that piece came another piece, a woman. And through that the fall and the sin and the earth, this earth spinning in space as it were lost. &gt;&gt; And God begins redemption. &gt;&gt; And he testifies to redemption. And he brings a imagine God I don't know how he did it but he brought a bloody skin. God what form he took I do not know but God dressed them. &gt;&gt; God put bloody skins on them. &gt;&gt; Oh I'd like to take time and give the drama that the prophet gives and how Adam uh and walking in that slapping sound of the hide and the skin bleeding and the blood running down his body. And for the first time, Eve puts her head over on Adam's shoulder and the tears begin to come. He said, "Now they can cry. They can cry now they couldn't before. They find within them an emotion they didn't have, didn't know they had, but now they're separated from God. And it creates another emotion. And God is already, he's already declaring, I'm going to redeem it. I'm going to settle this conflict. I'm going to defeat my enemy. Hallelujah. And he brings up people people's from the earth and they die. People, prophets come and they die and the and and Israel has great victories and they think, "Oh, maybe this is the answer." But the people die. The leaders die and they pass off the scene in the passing parade of humanity until a little girl could have been one of you young ladies here, a young girl 15 years old and uh she has a visitation, a supernatural visitation by an angel and the Virgin Mary said, "Let let it be unto me according to thy word." Amen. &gt;&gt; I heard a Jewish man speaking a few days ago and he he doesn't believe in Christianity, but he mentions the Virgin Mary and he spoke about Moses and spoke about the Virgin Mary and he says, "God, can he be God if he doesn't have someone that makes him God?" And I thought it was a profound statement. He said, "Moses," at the burning bush, the voice said, "I am." But Moses believed it and he made him God to the people. And Mary, he said, Mary made him God when she said, "Uh, be it unto me according to thy word." I thought it was a profound statement. And you people, God has sent you a word. You have to make him God &gt;&gt; by believing what he said. &gt;&gt; Be it unto me according to thy word. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. We can never be the image of God unless we believe it and stake our claim on it and stay with it. &gt;&gt; Make him God. &gt;&gt; And now, can you see with me? I'm not soon done, but listen. And here's this young girl. Brother Bren says perhaps 15 years old, young girl. She came when when all this humanity is coming. All God sees is a passing parade of the earth. The earth. The cursed earth. Cuz he cursed the earth. And these bodies came out of the earth. But here comes a girl. She's like any other girl and she's part of the soil. And God infuses her with a divine seed. &gt;&gt; And that seed is resting in a womb of the earth who came out of his womb of the earth. &gt;&gt; Because through that he's going to commence another creation. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Out of the earth. He's going to bring this creation and redeem the earth. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Oh, to me it's glorious. You certainly don't think that is getting way off someplace. &gt;&gt; That is marvelous. &gt;&gt; And he he he begins a new creation. And that is why Jesus could come to the Apostle John in the book of Revelation. I am the beginning of the creation of God, &gt;&gt; a new creation. And we are not part of an old image. We're part of that image. &gt;&gt; We're an icon of that life. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Jesus said, "Because I live, you live also." That's the icon. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. He that believeth on me shall never die. &gt;&gt; Glory to God. &gt;&gt; And that is why brother Brandham, we speak a lot about him. But I can tell you that is why that is why he made statements that was way out there, way out into another realm. It it is like I thought of it this morning. It is as though that that unseen realm was coming into him and through him by a process of osmosis. He knew it was there. He knew the position and he'd be in the unseen realm. He'd be in this realm. He'd be in the unseen. Be in the visible. Be in the realm of the material elements and be in the realm of the supernatural. Friends, that's never happened. No generation has received a ministry like that since Adam. &gt;&gt; Show me one. &gt;&gt; No, we are the people. &gt;&gt; And I'm going to speak to you, Lord willing, on representation. We have been brought under that representation. &gt;&gt; You don't have to do all those things. The disciples didn't do everything Jesus did. The disciples are mentioned that never been mentioned again in the Bible, but they were identified. &gt;&gt; And you are sitting here today. I want to tell you, you're sitting here today identified with something God did in this generation. &gt;&gt; God has identified you. He's stamped you. He's marked you as being part of those that are gathered by this voice. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Well, there's no place for me to stop, so I've just got to stop. That's all there is to it. &gt;&gt; I thought maybe I can bring this to you. You're nice. Maybe you can put the lights up a wee bit. I'll go on with the other slides. I I I use some descriptive words. Try to capture your imagination because it takes more than imagination to even get a hold of God. &gt;&gt; We think of them and you talk about those hundreds and hundreds and billions and trillions of light years of space. Well, we just lose it. But but he said he was making you. &gt;&gt; But then when he formed Adam out of something that had been taken billions of years of coming, when he formed him, he just breathed into him. That was just a a moment, a spark, and there it was. And man became a living soul. See, God can take and it maybe takes centuries and centuries and centuries. And finally, you know, he has a people on the earth. What is he doing? He's in with a plan of redemption. And he's got a people on the earth. And it has been centuries and centuries from Adam, centuries and centuries to Moses. And then then God moves. Bang. So quickly, so suddenly. And there it is. &gt;&gt; And he's got a prophet. He's going before Pharaoh saying, "Let my people go." And then it goes hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of years and wars and rumors of wars and fightings and all of the thing Egypt into Babylon and bondage and so on finally and then just like that and here's Jesus on earth &gt;&gt; and just a little we sliver of time and he's gone. &gt;&gt; And the people now what do we do? We had him. Now he's gone. But they followed the word and there were 120 of them in the upper room waiting waiting waiting 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 days and the Bible says and suddenly &gt;&gt; hallelujah &gt;&gt; that those clumps of clay that have been coming for hundreds of billions of light years yet now God is not going to take billions of light years suddenly there come a rushing mighty wind and they were all filled with the Holy Spirit and so filled they were like drunk men, drunk women staggered out onto the street uttering in other languages. &gt;&gt; Not a lot of the tongues that people think of today in in the realm of Pentecost, the Bible says, "How hear we every man in our own tongue." &gt;&gt; They heard languages &gt;&gt; and they heard the people glorifying God. That's the word of God. &gt;&gt; And that's what I stand on. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And it came suddenly. Now, been hundreds of years, hundreds of years, 2,000 years goes by and the war and the world becomes educated and sophisticated and and developed and cultured and cultivated and scientific and industrialized and start to almost like break into God's laboratory. And they are &gt;&gt; and suddenly &gt;&gt; suddenly comes a ministry on the scene. Suddenly supernatural begins to happen. And the people are in bewilderment. Where' this come from? And before they can even before they can even grapple with it, seven mighty angels. &gt;&gt; And the prophet says in a split. &gt;&gt; Do you believe it? God can take 2,000 years if he wants to and he can take one breath of a second. &gt;&gt; In the next and in a split they came. &gt;&gt; That which has been sealed up. That which has been sealed like the Apostle Paul, that which has been hidden from ages and generations is now made known to the people and made manifest to the people. &gt;&gt; And you're the people. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; You're the people. &gt;&gt; You're not of another age. You're not of another generation. You're the people. &gt;&gt; You're not from Luther's time. You're here now. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; You all ought to be consumed with it. &gt;&gt; You all, I don't care how quiet. I don't care how reserved you are. You ought to be something something inside your heart. Your soul heart ought to be beating. Say, "Oh, God. Oh God, I believe that. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; I thought too. We hear son of man. Son of man. Son of man. He also was the son of God's mind. He was the son of mind. The son of God's thoughts that came and has made known to us. our Lord Jesus Christ reveal himself to you as his bride. God bless you. I want you to go with these thoughts in your heart and mind, Lord willing, perhaps even Wednesday or for sure next Sunday, only one service Sunday morning. Next Sunday, December 24th and evening you'll be with families. Many of you I trust you'll be a mighty testimony. Let's stand to our feet, shall we? Almighty God, our divine father. How lovely and personal you are. I think of the songwriter's words, "My heart is stirred when air I think of Jesus." My heart is stirred at your presence this morning. My heart is stirred, oh God, that you have considered us worthy. You've made us worthy somehow. But you considered us, Lord, to be called and to be given some uh position so that we could have and know your voice. And I would say, Lord, for most of this congregation, I speak for them today. I do not know everyone's heart, but I do know, Lord, that you've called them. That's why they're here. And as we dedicated our brother Chetameir and sister Danka and their family, I thought of how far they have journeyed. But now I look across this audience and see those that have journeyed, oh God. And we've come a long ways in these 30ome years. We've journeyied and we've seen a lot of things take place. and we've seen those that have gone on to courageous victories and have been strengthened in the might of God. I thank you for this congregation of people and I pray with everything that is in me that you will endure them with a mighty sweep of the Holy Spirit. I pray, oh God, you'll take this congregation and allow the voice of this word to be uttered and to be heard around the globe. Father, you see our heart. We desire no position. We desire no recognition. We desire no uh kingdom of our own. We desire your kingdom to be established in the hearts of the people. &gt;&gt; Father, prepare the people for the service tonight as our brother John Andy's will come ministering you Lord your word and those that'll be baptized. And I pray Lord if there's any here that are yet in a condition of unbelief that they will be ashamed as your prophet said be ashamed of that. and he'll turn from that and he'll say, "Lord Jesus, you're too lovely. You're too wonderful. I forgive me. I'm sorry for doubting your word. Forgive me and draw me to yourself." If you're in that state and you just desire that prayer, you can raise your hand at least open your heart, lift up your heart to him. And do not be ashamed at this time of your need. People who got anything from God always were open about it. They would call with a loud voice if necessary and come running if necessary. &gt;&gt; Don't be afraid. Don't let Satan rob you now in &gt;&gt; the name of Jesus Christ. Satan, you can have no hold on these people that need you at this time. They need our Lord Jesus Christ. Lord, they need you. I pray, Father, that you'll do mighty things amongst us and prepare us, oh God, for the inevitable rapture and catching away of the church in Jesus Christ's name. And finally, Lord, I ask one last thing that you will put upon the people, especially those that have very little understanding. Would you reveal yourself to them &gt;&gt; in Jesus Christ's name? Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Man, let can I sing? This is your house. You all lift it up if you would, please. Maybe brother Rod, you could help me. This is your &gt;&gt; You believe it? This is your house. Bring their burdens and their car. This is your house. This is your house. Oh, come and is your father. Oh, this is your house. Bring their burdens. This is your house. This is your house, Lord. This is your God. And I'd like every person to hear what I have to say now because this is brother Ed Biscll and I'm placing a challenge out before you. When you sing these words, I want you in all truth from the very depths of your soul to be able to say, "Father, this is your house." And you are entirely free to come and dwell &gt;&gt; and have full control. How many will raise their hand and say, "I that's what I desire. And for those of you that couldn't raise your hand, I want to say this to you. You're going to cross into another region someday. And what are you going to do if this wasn't his house? Where are you going to be if this was not his house? &gt;&gt; Where do you plan to go? what is the direction that you go? And God will have people stand before him and you'll see this service all over again. And you'll see a preacher up here in his latter years begging as it were the people bringing the gospel in the clearest terms that I can. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Spending hours before God in a weary body so I can bring this word today. God's going to hold you accountable for that. Say, "Why didn't you raise your hand? Why didn't you call for me? Why didn't you make me go of your life?" &gt;&gt; This doctor that brother Tony stood beside, a tall, large, dignified man. I had never met him. I never shook his hand. But I noticed over here sitting while amongst maybe probably 1,200 people I noticed this man and he was listening so intently. I believe it must have been his wife sitting beside him about your size, brother West Niggard. That's why I was looking at you. He stood out amongst the people and then the pastor got up and begin to say to the people just like I'm standing here now who is going to be baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ. And there was no movement just for a moment. He just stood there. Here comes a man and senior adults, no children, no emotion. And here they began to come upstep this doctor moved out of his seat. People unabashedly not ashamed walked forward. 17 lined up across the front. I tell you what, friends, it was very touching. You could see they were making a deep, deep decision. this wasn't light, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; Perhaps many of them Catholic and now they come and move forward in front of that audience. We're going to be baptized. And do you know what? Every one of the 17 were baptized. &gt;&gt; Not one changed their mind from the service to the baptism in the afternoon. Everyone was baptized. Hallelujah. And I can tell you there's probably many, many more that wish they were there. You have a wonderful opportunity. They had a wonderful opportunity. I say close this service today making a rededication as brother Chadameir, Sister Dusanka did, a rededication. Oh God, this is your house. &gt;&gt; And then we'll close. And brother West Nygard, I'm going to have you come up and close in prayer. We'll sing it. Brother Rod. Sing it everyone. This is your holy house. our house. This is our last. This is your father. This is your &gt;&gt; I just can't let go. Somebody lost and you're so alone. You're out there in a confused state. A man of God is going to come in a few moments and pray. We're not going to pray to close the service of such and to pray that God will continue to move and work in people's lives long after they've left these doors. When you leave these doors, you'll not leave this presence cuz he, the one I preach, will be with you, going to go with you where the lost and the lonely &gt;&gt; can leave their burdens and their cares. And the only way that can happen is by you saying this is your house. &gt;&gt; Come father and dwell. This is your house. Oh father. This is your house. It's a holy house of prayer where the lost. Bring their burdens and their cares. This is your Lord. This is your brother. Let's bow our heads. Let's bow our heads. Heavenly Father, we are a blessed people to hear your word. Lord God, there's not a one of us that's here by accident. As brother Ed said, eons of time you thought about us, Lord God. We were there with you in your thoughts. Father God, here we are, December 2006. Many of us never thought we'd get to this time, Father God. But Lord God, you saw a fit to touch us. Many of us many years ago, Lord God, that was our time. And Father God, you have other children out there that have not heard your word, that have not come into the fullness of your word, Lord God. Father, your word is going out, Father, to Brazil, to other places in this in this world, Lord God, to find that last one, Father. Lord God, we've seen your word be made manifest, not in an old form, Lord God, of yesterday, but in a word of today, of now, Lord God. And Lord God, we know that your word does not go out and co and come back void. Lord God, we know that your word goes out and manifests itself in sons and daughters. And Lord God, we say, be it unto me according to your word, Lord God. Father God, we want to be walking not ahead or behind, but hand in hand with you, Father. Your word is fresh. Your word is real. Your word is more upto-date than the news that was produced this morning. Father, we thank you for it, heavenly father. Lord God, my heart quivers inside of me, seeing what you're doing, Father, knowing, Lord God, that we are standing truly on the edge of time, Lord God. And I thank you from my heart, from the bottom of my soul, Lord God. And I know many others in here are doing the same thing, saying, "Lord God, you brought me to this point. You're revealing your word. You're revealing your word and manifesting it in my life and in our lives. And we thank you for it, Lord God. Father, we thank you for the dedicated ministry that you've given us, Lord God, that have laid hours and hours and hours studying your word, praying, Lord God, to bring to us, Lord God, what we have need of, Father. Lord God, we came this morning with thoughts in our heart, with questions to be answered, Father, and you've been so mindful, Lord God. We thank you for that, Lord. Now, as we leave this place, heavenly father, the word that we heard, Lord God, we ask that you'd just keep it to the forefront of our mind, Lord God, if there's questions in our hearts, Lord God, we just ask you'd answer according to your perfect will, Lord God. Answer each and every question that we have, Lord God, it is your pure word being made manifest in this day. Lord, bless the people, Lord God. Bless them greatly. You have blessed us greatly. Now, as we leave, be with us, Lord God. May we just have a time of fellowship, Lord God. Some food to eat to give us energy to bring us back, Lord God, to hear your word preached again by Brother John. Father, Lord God, it's you speaking through a man, a dedicated vessel, Lord God, ask that you bless him, Lord God. Give to him that which you know we have need of. Father, in Jesus Christ's name, we pray these things. Amen. Amen. God bless you. We walk in the light as we shake hands with one another. And God bless you in this. &gt;&gt; We walk in the light. Beautiful life from where the You are my Jesus. The light of the world. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Heat. Heat. Heat. Heat. Heat. Heat. Heat. Jesus. Hallelujah. Gloral. Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
