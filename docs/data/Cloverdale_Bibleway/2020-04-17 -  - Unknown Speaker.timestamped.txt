[1:11] this account is regarding a soldier boy
[1:16] and knowing that I had raised I'd been
[1:22] raised in quite a few the army camped US
[1:25] army camps during the building of the
[1:28] Alaskan Highway now this was 1961 so I
[1:35] had not seen a US Army uniform but I in
[1:42] the foyer of the church where it wasn't
[1:46] the church it was the church hall in
[1:48] Dawson Creek United Church Hall in
[1:51] Dawson Creek and I looked through the
[1:56] people and I could see a staff sergeant
[1:59] on a tunic and so that caught my
[2:03] attention I thought that's nice to see
[2:05] you know and then I didn't see it
[2:08] anymore then while we are in the service
[2:13] we've come to the end of the service
[2:15] that is Saturday evening and brother
[2:21] Branham has preached the service from
[2:23] that time
[2:26] and we've come to the end of the service
[2:28] and these begins to sing the whole
[2:30] congregation begin to sing I love him I
[2:33] love him and right in the midst of that
[2:36] course of the first end of the course
[2:39] what's the matters told you boy
[2:45] you're not going to mid suicide the
[2:53] Devils are lying to you boy you've only
[2:57] got a faux B he's lying to your driving
[3:02] and save you bleeding denying renounce
[3:06] the devil I command you in the name of
[3:08] Jesus Christ you renounce the devil and
[3:10] accept Jesus Christ as your healer
[3:12] you'll go back and be a gentleman and a
[3:14] real real man do you do it raise up your
[3:16] hands to God and say praise God that's
[3:19] right oh hey man Michael told me be well
[3:21] Oh
[3:22] raise your hands me brave the amazing
[3:25] thing is I was there I was on the
[3:30] platform and so I immediately thought of
[3:33] this this tunic that I had seen and and
[3:38] young people were buying you know army
[3:41] uniforms and tunics and so on just
[3:44] wearing it as jackets so I didn't know
[3:46] but what it was that and so I began to
[3:51] look for Soulja Boy and others were
[3:54] looking also there were also some
[3:56] Canadian soldiers that had been
[3:59] attending the meeting one of them became
[4:02] a very very firm believer and we
[4:05] couldn't see any soldier boy at all and
[4:08] one brother branham continues to talk to
[4:11] him and says you'll go home and be a
[4:14] real gentleman and be a real man then
[4:17] neither devil deny him and so it was a
[4:22] it was a startling moment really and the
[4:27] next day we were leaving or there
[4:31] following day we were leaving early in
[4:33] the morning on Monday morning brother
[4:36] branham did not know where we were
[4:38] taking him I was just taking him off the
[4:40] Alaskan Highway and we were going to go
[4:43] about 375 400 miles so we drove as far
[4:51] as Fort Nelson which is mile 300
[4:54] and I said to brother branham I said you
[4:59] know maybe boy maybe we should have a
[5:01] bite to eat because by the time we get
[5:04] up to brother southwest place which will
[5:07] be mild 375 at that time I said you know
[5:13] sister Lila will probably be done or
[5:15] dishes at sister self waken he said I
[5:18] think that's a good idea so we just
[5:20] pulled off on an access road on the left
[5:23] side and stopped a little little
[5:26] stopping place it was like a little
[5:28] hotel when the US army pushed the
[5:32] highway through dawn through for Dawson
[5:35] Creek and then Fort st. John they passed
[5:38] the town and then the service stations
[5:42] etc built along side of the road and so
[5:46] we stopped in there but there was a
[5:48] restaurant just little clapboard
[5:50] building probably two stories and we're
[5:54] having or we're gonna have our lunch
[5:59] brother Chris Berg was with us brother
[6:02] Chris Berg brother branham and myself
[6:05] and we sat in a booth the waitress had
[6:08] come and taken our order and just after
[6:11] that the door opened which was on the
[6:15] side of the building and then came to
[6:17] Ben and I recognized as one as being the
[6:21] soldier boy that I'd seen in the tunic
[6:24] unit the tunic uniform I should say and
[6:28] I when I looked at him I said well fancy
[6:34] seeing you here I had been away from
[6:38] this area for about a year and a half
[6:41] and brother branham he just looked up
[6:45] over his shoulder like this to see who
[6:48] it was I was talking to he thought maybe
[6:50] perhaps one of my old friends I don't
[6:52] know what he thought exactly but just
[6:55] then a trend of a stout heavier set man
[6:59] squeezed between him and came around and
[7:03] and thrust his hand down
[7:05] towards brother branham and said brother
[7:07] branham he said remember calling out the
[7:10] soldier boy and and brother branham was
[7:13] a little startled because he hadn't
[7:15] expected that and he said he said he
[7:19] looked across the table he said did you
[7:21] remember brother Eddie I said yes you
[7:24] said hey you're not commit suicide
[7:27] soldier boy that's the devil talking to
[7:30] you he said yeah that's what you said
[7:31] that's what you said and he's shaking
[7:33] brother branham's hand he said well I
[7:36] brought him all the way from Fairbanks
[7:39] and we tried to get him into a prayer
[7:41] line and we weren't able to get him into
[7:43] a prayer line he said this is him would
[7:46] you pray for him and oh sure and just
[7:49] that moment the waitress came and slid
[7:52] our soup in front of us and so so
[7:56] brother Brown said well perhaps and that
[7:59] was one of my first real shocking
[8:04] moments
[8:04] I thought brother Branham was going to
[8:06] stand and pray for him to cast that
[8:08] devil out of him you know because that
[8:10] was how I had been brought up and
[8:13] brother Branham said well maybe we'll
[8:16] just eat our soup first
[8:17] and I thought eat her soup you know here
[8:21] here's a soldier boy trying to commit
[8:23] suicide so anyway they said well that'll
[8:26] be fine we need to get something to eat
[8:28] ourselves and they went down to three
[8:30] booths and sat him to have their dinner
[8:33] and then brother Branham entered into
[8:37] visions and he just looked over my head
[8:39] and began to talk about what had
[8:43] happened in the prayer line the day
[8:45] before he said I believe there was a
[8:47] blind woman that came through the
[8:50] service yesterday and I said well I
[8:54] can't remember a blind woman and brother
[8:57] Chris Berg spoke up he said yeah I
[8:59] believe there was a blind woman and
[9:02] brother Branham he is not really
[9:04] acknowledging our conversation he just
[9:07] looking over my head and he said yes he
[9:12] said let's see yes he said oh I
[9:16] understand I say no
[9:19] he said there's a young German woman
[9:21] that has given up her place in the
[9:25] prayer line to lead the blind woman
[9:28] through and then he he looked at me he
[9:31] said you see brother Eddie it may be
[9:34] that she's praying right now and they
[9:37] said just a moment and he looks away for
[9:42] a moment he said yes she's a German
[9:45] woman just to help you believe he said
[9:48] I'll ask him and he'll give me her name
[9:50] and he just looked away
[9:53] he said yes her name is sister Fair in
[9:57] English we would say fear but in German
[10:01] we would say fair sister fair and then
[10:05] he just moved his head for a little bit
[10:08] he said you see perhaps she's praying
[10:11] just now he said she has a heart trouble
[10:16] she has on two or three organs in her
[10:21] body and he named them and said she's
[10:25] she may be praying just now I asked my
[10:30] father if he could find this woman and
[10:33] my father found her she was in a city
[10:39] quite a bit south of Dawson Creek and it
[10:44] would have been about five hundred miles
[10:46] from where we were sitting and I I just
[10:50] found myself in an unusual place and now
[10:54] with that soldier boy in his need
[10:58] brother branham became under that burden
[11:02] so soon as we were finished eating we
[11:05] got up to pay the bill and brother
[11:08] Branham he's standing right in front he
[11:11] wouldn't he wouldn't let anyone pay the
[11:14] bill so he's standing right in front of
[11:16] the cash desk and where I'm standing
[11:19] right beside him and the soldier boy
[11:21] came in and he's right behind him and
[11:23] the soldier boy just tapped him on the
[11:26] shoulder
[11:27] he said brother Brad
[11:29] he said just two minutes just two
[11:31] minutes oh sure he said and and and a
[11:36] little don't fell we're all in the group
[11:38] there and we walked out the door and
[11:41] outside the door was a small sidewalk it
[11:45] went down here would be to the left as
[11:49] we came out and went down to the garbage
[11:52] cans and up to the right would be where
[11:56] the cars were parked on the gravel
[11:59] access road and so I and Chris Berg and
[12:04] the little heavyset fellow who drove him
[12:07] down went up we went up there but I
[12:11] faced myself so I could watch and see
[12:14] that brother branham what he was doing
[12:16] because I was very very curious in my
[12:20] young heart I was about 26 27 and I'd
[12:26] been preaching for several years but I
[12:29] was just there was no such a thing as
[12:33] knowing the message yet there's no such
[12:35] a thing I had no knowledge of Malachi 4
[12:38] had no knowledge of Revelation no
[12:41] knowledge of a messenger I only knew
[12:44] that brother Branham had of unique the
[12:50] unique part of his ministry was the
[12:54] angel of the Lord that was always there
[12:57] and I thought if that angel of the Lord
[13:01] is in attendance at these meetings
[13:04] regardless of what anyone has said about
[13:06] him or said about his doctrine
[13:08] I would I would know by the presence of
[13:12] the angel of the Lord that he would not
[13:15] honor something that was not correct or
[13:18] true
[13:19] and so as I was watching brother branham
[13:23] I saw that he had his hat off and I knew
[13:27] that he was praying and then he slipped
[13:30] his hat back on and both of both he and
[13:33] the soldier boy turned around and
[13:35] they're walking very erect towards me
[13:39] the soldier boy was bit quite a bit
[13:41] taller than brother branham and I
[13:44] thought at that instant I thought now
[13:47] this should be a very charismatic
[13:51] movement and I'm not going to be swept
[13:54] away by the you know the excitement or
[13:57] the emotion of the moment and that's
[13:59] what I had just had in my heart but the
[14:04] soldier boy's face was completely
[14:06] transformed he was he was just totally
[14:11] relaxed and he thrust his hand up in the
[14:14] air with his fists he said I'm free I'm
[14:19] free I'm free and they came up and the
[14:25] soldier said to me said this man told me
[14:30] something that only I and my wife in
[14:33] this world know he says and when he did
[14:35] it was gone so we stepped into our cars
[14:40] and we said our farewells and I guess I
[14:44] understand I took a picture of them and
[14:47] which I'm this is a unique part of this
[14:52] ministry and a unique part of my
[14:54] testimony is the eternal aspect of God
[15:00] because here I had it on a platform now
[15:04] here we were 300 miles of the road and
[15:08] all I can really say is I was there on
[15:11] the platform I heard him call the
[15:15] soldier boy out we have it on tape
[15:18] now I'm 300 miles away
[15:22] and you you have to understand where we
[15:25] were standing you probably could go a
[15:28] thousand or 1500 miles north and never
[15:32] see a human you could probably go at
[15:35] least five six seven hundred miles south
[15:38] and never see a human down the Rocky
[15:40] Mountain trench from where we were truly
[15:44] a needle in a haystack and that man had
[15:48] brought the soldier down for prayer from
[15:52] Fairbanks Alaska fifteen hundred and
[15:55] twenty three miles on a very difficult
[15:59] journey actually believed he said I
[16:04] believed that we would find you and the
[16:09] soldier boy spoke up and he said that is
[16:11] correct this man actually believed we
[16:14] would find you today and to find two
[16:18] humans or three humans in that part of
[16:23] the world was is more than a needle in a
[16:27] haystack it just had to be sovereign
[16:30] Almighty God and now he's saying his
[16:33] final words while they were down praying
[16:37] at the garbage cans this heavyset man
[16:43] was kind of nervously speaking he said
[16:47] he's tried to commit suicide three times
[16:51] he's been under the care of the army
[16:53] doctors and he said they can't figure
[16:56] out what's wrong with him he has he has
[17:00] a lovely Christian wife and two
[17:03] beautiful children and they just
[17:06] couldn't figure out what was wrong with
[17:08] him when we got in our cars brother
[17:12] branham he just on a little access road
[17:15] and it was rough and brother branham
[17:20] said to me said brother Eddie he said
[17:22] you don't know this young man or I said
[17:26] no I don't really
[17:28] he said that he's not a good friend of
[17:30] yours I said no I don't know him he said
[17:36] not likely you'll ever see him again
[17:39] and I know I noticed that not likely
[17:43] you'll ever see him again
[17:44] and I said no I said he lives in
[17:48] Fairbanks Alaska
[17:50] I live in Victoria British Columbia not
[17:54] likely will ever see him again
[17:56] he said no just to help you believe he
[18:01] said if if you knew him if he was a good
[18:05] friend of yours I'd never tell you but
[18:09] he said when we got to the end of the
[18:11] sidewalk he came to us there I knew
[18:14] exactly what he was talking about he
[18:17] came to us there and told him had a
[18:20] lovely Christian wife and two beautiful
[18:23] children I just heard that two three
[18:27] minutes before from his friend that
[18:30] drove him down and I wouldn't be telling
[18:33] this account to you or the world if he
[18:39] had said he had a Christian wife and
[18:42] three children but the man told me he
[18:46] had a lovely Christian wife and two
[18:48] children here's brother brown telling me
[18:50] he has a lovely Christian wife and two
[18:53] children but he had been committing
[18:55] homosexual acts with young men and as
[19:00] soon as he said that he said as soon as
[19:03] that was uncovered Satan lost his power
[19:06] and I I learned a great truth at that
[19:09] moment that all Satan has to be as
[19:13] exposed once he's exposed
[19:15] he's lost his power now here I come to a
[19:20] very unique part of this whole ministry
[19:24] that one that was talking and speaking
[19:28] he came to us there that one
[19:33] who said what his problem was that God
[19:37] is timeless he's eternal and it was 36
[19:43] years later 36 years later a few years
[19:48] ago oh I was in my study and I came
[19:55] upstairs and my daughter Marilyn our
[19:59] middle daughter her and her husband Mike
[20:02] had been down to Florida and had been
[20:07] visiting a church and the pastor brother
[20:10] Bob Brown gave Marilyn a picture and
[20:14] said here give this to your dad I think
[20:17] it may be northern Canada and he might
[20:19] know something about it so when I came
[20:22] upstairs from study my wife said Marilyn
[20:26] left a picture here for you brother Bob
[20:29] Brown sent it up so I went to the little
[20:33] telephone desk and I'm I'm holding the
[20:35] picture and it's the soldier boy and the
[20:39] man that brought him down from Fairbanks
[20:41] and brother branham standing between
[20:43] them and I took the picture I couldn't
[20:46] remember taking the picture but I was
[20:49] the only other person except brother
[20:51] Chris Berg who wouldn't know how to
[20:53] handle the camera and I was struck into
[20:58] silence and she and my wife said what is
[21:04] it I couldn't seem to answer her she
[21:08] said again what is it what is it what is
[21:12] a picture I said it's the soldier boy I
[21:16] said I've got to call brother brown so I
[21:20] called him and got him on the phone
[21:22] right away I said brother brown where
[21:27] did you get this picture he said well I
[21:31] had a young man here in the church he
[21:36] was kind of a you know he wasn't really
[21:39] stable he didn't seem to be stable he
[21:42] was here and then he would be drifting
[21:44] someplace else
[21:46] I said is he still there no he said he's
[21:49] not here anymore he said and he was
[21:52] working in a with a construction company
[21:56] they were building a wall and some
[21:59] people were in there doing the floor and
[22:02] this young guy he was always wanting to
[22:06] witness to somebody so he was talking to
[22:08] this man about brother Brennan and he
[22:13] said and the other other fella said well
[22:16] I've had my picture taken with him and
[22:19] he brought him that picture and brother
[22:22] Brennan had said to me not likely you'll
[22:24] ever see him again I tried to make
[22:27] contact with him but I could not I never
[22:31] have seen him since well since that day
[22:34] a week in Fort Nelson British Columbia
[22:37] and so I begin to realize the
[22:40] timelessness and how something an event
[22:45] will happen but it's not just a single
[22:48] event
[22:49] it just keeps unfolding and unfolding
[22:52] because it's an eternal God and that is
[22:56] the story of the soldier boy
[22:59] [Music]
