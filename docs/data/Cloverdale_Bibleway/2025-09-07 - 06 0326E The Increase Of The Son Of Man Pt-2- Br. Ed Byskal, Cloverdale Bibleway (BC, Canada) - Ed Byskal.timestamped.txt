[25:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[25:58] &gt;&gt; Are you longing to see Jesus?
[26:00] &gt;&gt; Amen. We're going to go to prayer this
[26:03] time. We have no prayer request. I ask
[26:04] brother Ken Ardal, brother Ken, if you'd
[26:07] come and just open the service in a word
[26:08] of prayer. I don't know if you have
[26:10] anything on your heart, just raise your
[26:11] hand as we go to prayer. Those on the
[26:14] telephone hookup, also on the internet,
[26:16] I urge you to do the same. for the can
[26:18] if you'd come.
[26:21] [Music]
[26:27] How many have a need tonight?
[26:30] Amen. I guess if we opened up a
[26:33] microphone and asked each one of us what
[26:35] was on our heart, loved ones, needs in
[26:37] our own lives, sickness and disease and
[26:41] friends and finance. Each one of us has
[26:45] a need, but we know that we serve a God
[26:48] that is more than sufficient for that
[26:50] need. And he's the one we're approaching
[26:52] now. He knows us better than we know
[26:54] ourselves. So, let's just bow. Father,
[26:57] we're bowing before you with our hands
[26:59] raised, recognizing that there is no
[27:02] good thing in us, Lord. recognizing that
[27:05] without the deposit of God and that
[27:07] predestinated life within us, Lord, that
[27:09] we would be inadequate, that we would be
[27:12] unable to even begin to approach a
[27:14] living God, the mighty one that created
[27:16] heavens and earth. And yet tonight, we
[27:18] find ourselves in the economy of God. We
[27:21] find ourselves redeemed tonight, Father.
[27:24] We sign we find ourselves coming boldly
[27:27] before your throne Lord with our
[27:29] petitions God once again united together
[27:32] as saints of like precious faith we're
[27:35] asking Lord tonight that you would come
[27:37] with every uplifted hand with every
[27:39] uplifted heart father we pray that you
[27:41] would minister life minister grace
[27:43] minister mercy we pray Lord we don't
[27:46] want justice tonight we want mercy we
[27:49] pray Lord that the God of mercy would
[27:51] come and meet each need each life
[27:54] Father, we ask Lord for the service
[27:56] tonight, the preaching of the word, the
[27:58] receiving of the word. We ask that you
[28:00] will give us ears to hear, Father. Lord,
[28:03] that still small voice that would lead
[28:05] us and guide us. We pray, Lord, that
[28:08] each one that would be here, those that
[28:10] do not know you, we pray that you would
[28:12] minister mercy to them, Lord. Save the
[28:14] lost, we pray. Heal the sick, we ask,
[28:17] Lord Jesus. Deliver the oppressed and
[28:19] the needy tonight, Lord. And that will
[28:21] happen by the receiving of your word.
[28:24] We're praying, Lord, that you will
[28:25] anoint brother Ed as he would come once
[28:28] more. Lord, we pray that you would move
[28:30] amongst every heart and every life, have
[28:32] your divine way, Lord, as we commit
[28:34] ourselves to you in Jesus' name. Amen.
[28:39] [Music]

[28:48] Amen. I want to welcome everyone
[28:49] tonight. If you're visiting with us, I
[28:51] know we got a number of out of town
[28:52] guests here for communion. We want to
[28:54] say God bless you. Our sister Rhysa and
[28:57] a group have a special for us as they

[29:44] No, it's Jesus.
[29:47] He is the one.
[29:51] He's the rock of salvation.
[29:55] He's a firm foundation.
[29:59] It's in Jesus.
[30:02] He is the one.
[30:06] [Music]
[30:26] [Music]
[31:11] broken,
[31:17] mocked and scorned.
[31:21] was a man hanging on a cross
[31:27] with a crown of thorns.
[31:30] Who is he?
[31:33] [Music]

[32:00] He took my pain and he bore my shame.
[32:06] That day on Calary,
[32:09] the bleeding one
[32:14] was God's holy
[32:16] son.
[32:20] What kind of man is this who walk that
[32:24] road alone?
[32:28] Jesus.
[32:34] It was supposed
[32:37] to be you and me
[32:41] hanging on that tree.
[32:44] It was our sin that crucified
[32:49] him. We don't deserve any mercy.
[32:54] So as we come to you today,
[32:59] we remember what you gave. Lord, through
[33:05] this bleeding word you have revealed to
[33:10] us our name.
[33:15] He died for you.
[33:19] He died for me.
[33:25] He took my pain and he bore my shame
[33:30] that day on Calary.
[33:34] The beating.
[33:38] The holy son.
[33:44] What kind of man is this who walk this
[33:48] road alone?

[41:27] tonight.
[41:28] I'd asked the brothers just to play at
[41:31] least part of a song that uh my wife
[41:34] wrote and I think that when she wrote
[41:36] it, there were some people that had come
[41:38] and asked her, "Well, who did you write
[41:40] it for?" And and uh she didn't say who
[41:43] it was for, but different ones and said,
[41:45] "Oh, that really spoke to me." But maybe
[41:48] I'll tell the rest of the story after
[41:49] you hear hear that song if the brothers
[41:51] could play that.

[43:02] to rise in faithful love and boldly say
[43:09] to them,

[43:21] Lord,
[43:24] though your first love has died,
[43:28] I see it alive.
[43:33] As you build a wall of lies,
[43:38] truth will prevail.
[43:42] I see you fully satisfied
[43:50] behind the veil.
[43:55] The tokens applied.
[43:59] There's blood on the door.
[44:04] That door is now closing.
[44:08] I'm still believing, Lord.
[44:12] [Music]
[44:14] An eagle blind
[44:18] and wrapped in heavy chains
[44:23] stumbles down
[44:26] [Applause]
[44:27] pleasures dark lane.
[44:32] Shake out the feathers
[44:36] replace with thorns.
[44:40] [Music]
[44:41] If through fiery pain a sinner soul can
[44:45] be reborn.
[44:50] But even as you walk away,
[44:55] I see you restored.
[45:00] Though your first love has died,
[45:04] I see it alive.

[45:53] today.
[45:58] Time
[46:00] is slipping
[46:03] away.
[46:07] [Music]
[46:28] I think you have the idea there
[46:32] for uh for those of you that you see me
[46:36] sitting in church over here and may not
[46:38] know um may may not know me that well.
[46:42] Um
[46:44] my family moved here in 1990
[46:47] and uh we began attending church here
[46:51] and as soon as we moved here uh God did
[46:55] a great miracle in my life and uh
[46:58] supernaturally delivered me from the
[47:00] things of the world. And shortly after
[47:03] 1990 I was baptized
[47:06] and began serving the Lord um at that
[47:10] time. And uh
[47:14] it was uh I guess 2 years after that uh
[47:17] God gave me a wife and we Elizabeth and
[47:19] we got married in this church and uh
[47:25] as many of you know I guess you got
[47:27] married that have gotten married.
[47:29] There's a lot more to I guess uh life
[47:31] once you get married responsibilities
[47:33] you know the Bible speaks of u
[47:37] the car the seed falling into into gr
[47:40] into the ground and uh some some seed
[47:43] falls into good ground some gets uh uh
[47:47] blown away I guess I don't know if
[47:49] that's exact uh scripture reference but
[47:52] you uh through the cares of life the
[47:55] seed is choked and I guess that's what
[47:58] what I allowed to happen. It just didn't
[48:01] happen, you know, by chance, but I
[48:03] allowed it. And uh I just found just
[48:08] that I was starting to drift. And I
[48:11] still came to church, you know, and uh
[48:14] just spiritually I was drifting.
[48:18] And um
[48:20] God would continue to speak to me and in
[48:23] the services and and the different
[48:25] ministers, they'd say, you know, you
[48:26] have you should be a the spiritual high
[48:28] priest of your home. And I never just
[48:30] could quite attain to that uh level in
[48:33] my home. And uh it uh
[48:39] it was um I guess uh right after we went
[48:43] to to Mount Baker camp, we had a
[48:46] visiting minister
[48:48] um brother I guess it was brother Donnie
[48:50] Reagan. He was speaking at that camp and
[48:52] I still remember something he said that
[48:54] kind of struck me at that time. It was
[48:56] that you could sit in the best message
[48:58] church in the in the world and find
[49:01] yourself spiritually dead. Right.
[49:05] &gt;&gt; And at that time I I could I guess I
[49:08] could say I wasn't wasn't dead
[49:10] spiritually yet, but death is a process.
[49:15] And uh over the years, it was a a
[49:19] sliding, I guess, backsliding.
[49:22] And probably nobody knew, but it it
[49:26] happened so slowly. you start to allow
[49:28] things into your life that uh if you
[49:31] said hey
[49:34] three years ago, four years ago, you
[49:36] you'd say that and you go, "No, I would
[49:37] never do that." But then as you
[49:40] backslide, it becomes easier and easier
[49:42] to justify things.
[49:44] And uh
[49:46] so there was a a natural event I guess
[49:50] you remember September 11th
[49:53] and for some reason that really affected
[49:55] me as I
[49:58] saw the suffering of people and mankind
[50:02] you know just people I don't know but it
[50:06] for some reason it just really struck me
[50:09] and uh
[50:11] so many innocent people had died and you
[50:13] know you know the story. But then I I
[50:17] guess uh Satan kind of I I guess it had
[50:20] to have been the devil began to get me
[50:23] to doubt well there's not maybe not even
[50:24] a god.
[50:27] And you have to realize I was raised in
[50:29] the message. So I knew the message
[50:31] appeared
[50:32] and in uh psy you know this message
[50:35] psychology I guess you'd say and knew
[50:38] the quotes and uh knew all that head
[50:43] knowledge part but
[50:45] uh
[50:47] continued to slide over the years and uh
[50:52] started feeding well I didn't start but
[50:55] continued to feed on the raw wrong
[50:56] things and music.
[51:00] Um, you know, and that music is a subtle
[51:04] thing, especially country music because
[51:06] country music came from from the go from
[51:09] uh southern gospel
[51:12] and it was backsliden people that
[51:15] started singing country music. But in
[51:18] country music, they kind of sing about
[51:19] God. So backsliden person can kind of,
[51:21] you know, hey, it's kind of their
[51:25] way of justifying, hey, it's okay.
[51:28] So, uh, and then like brother Ed said
[51:31] this morning, what you feed on, you
[51:33] become what you feed on.
[51:35] &gt;&gt; And, uh, so I wasn't this whole time I
[51:39] just wasn't feeding on the right things.
[51:42] And I related to brother Ed the other
[51:43] day about how
[51:45] brother Brandham said that
[51:48] which dog is winning, the white dog or
[51:50] the black dog. Talked to the Indian
[51:52] chief and he said which one I feed the
[51:53] most.
[51:55] And I was feeding the wrong one.
[52:00] And now I might say some things that
[52:03] might shock some people, but
[52:06] when I was in the world,
[52:08] uh, alcohol, drugs was a problem.
[52:11] And for some reason, I allowed the
[52:13] alcohol demon of alcohol back into my
[52:16] life.
[52:17] And you imagine you see somebody sitting
[52:19] in church, they you don't know what you
[52:21] know what they're going through.
[52:23] And that's what I was going through.
[52:26] And
[52:29] Elizabeth at this, you know, through
[52:31] this whole thing that kind of set her
[52:33] into desperation.
[52:35] And she spoke to brother Biscll. She
[52:37] never one thing I I give her great
[52:39] credit for she didn't speak to her
[52:42] friends about about me you know blab but
[52:46] she always made me look good to the
[52:48] people which I think down the road would
[52:51] would pay off in that you know if she
[52:54] would have spoken to a lot of people it
[52:56] would have been a lot harder to you know
[52:58] to face people but
[53:01] um so she was just a faithful prayer
[53:04] warrior and and began to pray and spoke
[53:07] with brother Bisco about it. And I guess
[53:08] I didn't know that at the time. And uh
[53:13] so brother Ed, I I probably I believe I
[53:16] could say without doubt that he took
[53:19] this began to take this matter to prayer
[53:21] as well. And uh we had a visiting
[53:25] minister about a month ago, I guess,
[53:28] during winter camp, brother Aaron
[53:29] McGary.
[53:31] And during his services, he spoke some
[53:33] very direct things. And
[53:38] we don't I guess I way I look at it as
[53:41] we can't hear it straight enough.
[53:44] And uh so even in those services, um God
[53:49] had started to deal with me again,
[53:50] especially when it was so direct.
[53:53] And I know I knew that like I said
[53:56] before maybe I was doubting that there
[53:57] was a God, but who could who could speak
[54:00] so direct
[54:02] and know exactly be as in your bed
[54:06] chamber as it were and speak such direct
[54:09] things. And so, uh,
[54:13] I had come home from work on, uh, it was
[54:17] February the 23rd on a Thursday,
[54:20] and Elizabeth had a nice dinner all
[54:22] ready to go. on. So, I sat down. She put
[54:25] the kids to bed because I usually get
[54:27] home 8 to 9:00.
[54:30] And she started to started to speak with
[54:33] me
[54:34] and uh
[54:38] told me how burdened she was for me. And
[54:41] uh so, you know, I thought, well,
[54:44] that's, you know, I appreciate that. And
[54:48] but my, you know, my mind was filled
[54:50] with so many questions. And when you're
[54:51] not feeding on the on the word, it's
[54:54] easy for the devil to get in there and
[54:56] cause so many doubts. Pretty soon you
[54:59] don't know who you are. And so I just
[55:03] was telling her some of these questions
[55:04] I had. I said, you know, if God's a
[55:08] healer, how come people aren't healed?
[55:12] And the different ones that have have
[55:14] gone on to be with the Lord, I said,
[55:15] what about them? You know, God, how come
[55:17] God doesn't didn't heal them?
[55:20] But uh I'll get to that a little bit
[55:23] later. How God answered that question.
[55:26] So, she said to me something I that I
[55:28] thought, well, what she said was
[55:32] if there's any uh why don't you listen
[55:36] to some uh messages and download I have
[55:38] an MP3 player and she said, you know,
[55:41] why don't you uh download some sermons
[55:45] and uh
[55:47] start listening to those and see if
[55:49] there's anything that that may be there
[55:51] that God could awaken it. And like I
[55:54] said, God was already starting to deal
[55:55] with me. And I said, 'Okay, I'll I'll uh
[55:59] do that and I'll I'll listen to the
[56:01] these messages and and I for I drive for
[56:04] a living, so I have quite a bit of time
[56:06] uh window time in a in a truck and on
[56:09] the way back and forth to work. So I uh
[56:13] I did that. I had I think about 12
[56:15] messages.
[56:16] And I remember one night on the way to
[56:19] uh or one morning, I guess it was middle
[56:21] it seemed like the middle of the night.
[56:23] It was about 2:00 in the morning. I was
[56:25] on my way to work and I was listening to
[56:28] this these message uh one of these
[56:30] messages in particular and I I remember
[56:33] praying and I said, "God, if you're
[56:35] real, do something that I can't do
[56:38] myself
[56:40] and take away the desire for these
[56:42] things."
[56:44] So, I continued to to feed on that.
[56:48] And in one of the messages, it happened
[56:50] to be for some reason uh it was a
[56:55] message from the church uh the Happy
[56:57] Valley of Brother Donnie Reagan's
[56:58] church. And he had mentioned in there
[57:01] that there was in the one in the middle
[57:03] of this service that there was a sister
[57:06] in their church that had gotten cancer.
[57:10] And it was actually a sister, a mother
[57:14] of one of the brothers in the church.
[57:15] and she was a believer and she had was
[57:18] stricken with cancer very bad and she
[57:21] was on her sounded like on her deathbed
[57:25] and she just raised up one day and just
[57:28] started praising God and brother Reagan
[57:31] said that that was like a slap in the
[57:33] face to the devil because he says God
[57:36] doesn't redeem our flesh this body but
[57:40] he redeems our soul
[57:43] and and And it it struck me, you know, I
[57:46] thought, well,
[57:48] that's what happened with Sister Marge,
[57:52] that God had redeemed her soul and and
[57:54] she maintained her testimony to the end
[57:58] and chose to take her
[58:01] and this this flesh is just a temporary
[58:03] house. So, that was one direct answer. I
[58:06] thought, well, that, you know, that's
[58:08] right. And so and and some of the other
[58:12] questions I mentioned to brother Ed that
[58:13] I had that I thought were such great
[58:15] questions in my mind just dissolved when
[58:18] I began to listen to the word.
[58:21] And so
[58:23] brother Ed was still under this burden
[58:26] because he didn't know all the things
[58:27] that had been happening in my life you
[58:30] know in the me listening to the
[58:32] messages. So he came and he he read out
[58:35] of Malachi
[58:38] and it's a me a a scripture that is very
[58:42] common to believers.
[58:44] He said, "Behold," this was on um March
[58:47] the 5th, and he spoke the message, "He
[58:52] shall turn the heart."
[58:55] And he and he read from this scripture,
[58:57] "Behold, I'll send you Elijah the
[58:58] prophet before the coming of the great
[59:00] and dreadful day of the Lord. and he
[59:03] shall turn the heart of the fathers to
[59:05] the children and the heart of the
[59:08] children to the fathers lest I come and
[59:09] smite this earth with a curse.
[59:12] And so that was his text.
[59:15] So I sat there and I listen
[59:18] and he as he spoke about how that
[59:21] there's there'll be corners in our lives
[59:23] that will come that
[59:26] that we won't be able to negotiate the
[59:28] curve oursself.
[59:30] And I knew I was in that place.
[59:34] So
[59:37] I listened as as he spoke that and he
[59:39] then he began right at the end of the
[59:41] service. You remember he spoke about the
[59:42] young lady in the insane institution
[59:46] and how she uh was there and spoke with
[59:49] brother Brandham and how she said I
[59:52] tried so many times before you know and
[59:54] and that felt like that was me and I so
[59:58] I believe that God left in 99 maybe it
[1:00:00] was for nobody else but me that day. So
[1:00:04] after the service, I responded and came
[1:00:06] up right down here in front of this
[1:00:08] speaker here
[1:00:10] and began to pray.
[1:00:12] And I asked God sincerely
[1:00:15] and earnestly to loose me from those
[1:00:18] things that had bound me
[1:00:29] &gt;&gt; and I asked him to fill me and create in
[1:00:32] me a clean heart.
[1:00:35] And
[1:00:36] I guess there was many people here
[1:00:40] and uh many people praying and
[1:00:44] and so I think brother Ernie prayed with
[1:00:47] me over here and he asked me he says is
[1:00:49] there anything that that uh you have on
[1:00:53] your heart that you want to pray about?
[1:00:54] And I I just couldn't utter the words.
[1:00:58] And so he prayed with me and
[1:01:01] and uh so after I think brother Ed had
[1:01:04] sang a few songs and dismissed
[1:01:07] and I guess when he came back around he
[1:01:09] could he could see me said uh down here
[1:01:12] and he came over and he asked me he said
[1:01:16] he said uh could I pray with you? And I
[1:01:20] think the key there is with
[1:01:23] not for
[1:01:26] because we have to want it ourselves.
[1:01:30] And so
[1:01:32] so he uh
[1:01:35] he began to just talk to me and counsel
[1:01:39] me there. Told me a few things.
[1:01:42] And uh so he uh he told me too. He said,
[1:01:48] he said, "Don't expect," he he had heard
[1:01:50] me praying, I guess, and I was just
[1:01:53] crying out to God, and he said, "Don't
[1:01:55] expect any any lightning bolts or any
[1:01:58] anything like that, but just begin to
[1:02:00] thank him." So, I began to thank him for
[1:02:04] uh for my deliverance and thank you for
[1:02:07] his filling, infilling.
[1:02:10] And I got up and I like I said, I didn't
[1:02:13] feel like there was anything lightning
[1:02:15] bolts or anything,
[1:02:18] but I believed when I got up.
[1:02:22] It was just simple. I I don't know how
[1:02:25] to explain it. I just believed
[1:02:28] that I've been delivered from those
[1:02:29] demons that had haunted me.
[1:02:33] So, I don't know uh how else to explain
[1:02:36] it, but I believe that God heard heard
[1:02:39] my prayer and heard brother Bisll, my
[1:02:41] wife, as I as I was on my face before
[1:02:45] God. And I can say that God delivered me
[1:02:49] with a mighty hand that day.
[1:02:52] &gt;&gt; And I I communicated
[1:02:55] talked to Brother Edward by via email
[1:02:58] after that service. And I just gave him
[1:03:01] a bit of a testimony. I said, you know,
[1:03:04] I feel like how uh uh Samson must have
[1:03:08] felt that after he had been deceived by
[1:03:13] uh Delilah and they shaved his hair off
[1:03:18] and the power of God and left him.
[1:03:22] Well, while he was there, his hair began
[1:03:24] to grow back.
[1:03:26] And then, Brother Biscll, I told him, I
[1:03:30] said, 'I felt like I haven't I've never
[1:03:33] experienced God in that way before in my
[1:03:35] life,
[1:03:36] his nearness. And and he said
[1:03:40] he said that that was a perfect
[1:03:42] reference and he's used that before,
[1:03:45] how that he could reach up and feel the
[1:03:48] stubble
[1:03:49] &gt;&gt; and the power of God had returned to
[1:03:51] him. And I believe that day that the m
[1:03:54] the dynamics of the Holy Spirit had come
[1:03:58] came to me that day and met the
[1:04:01] mechanics. So, I just wanted to give
[1:04:03] glory to God
[1:04:05] &gt;&gt; and give thanks to him for
[1:04:07] &gt;&gt; for doing that for me. And it's it's for
[1:04:13] I I just was praying with the kids and I
[1:04:17] was for some reason I when I was praying
[1:04:20] I I started think uh praying out loud
[1:04:23] about uh uh Legion and he was he was uh
[1:04:29] bound with chains and they break the
[1:04:31] chains and and uh cut himself with
[1:04:35] stones. But when Jesus he saw Jesus a
[1:04:39] far off
[1:04:41] and there wasn't enough devils in hell
[1:04:44] to stop Jesus the word from delivering
[1:04:49] uh Legion and Brother Brandham said
[1:04:51] about Legion that he was he was a good
[1:04:54] boy and he began to hang around the
[1:04:56] wrong people
[1:04:58] and uh
[1:05:01] that was the beginning of his
[1:05:02] backsliding and one day he found himself
[1:05:05] in the tombs and that I just believe
[1:05:07] that there was not enough devils in hell
[1:05:10] that could keep me from being restored
[1:05:13] as you heard in that song. And also uh I
[1:05:16] just uh think that I was also praying
[1:05:20] that day too with the kids. I said, you
[1:05:21] know, in my prayer that uh
[1:05:25] it just
[1:05:28] you don't uh God looks down. He said,
[1:05:31] "This one's mine. That one's mine. this
[1:05:34] one's mine and he just begins to draw
[1:05:38] and not one of them will be lost.
[1:05:40] &gt;&gt; So, I want to just give thanks to God
[1:05:42] and uh thank you for those who did pray
[1:05:45] for me. I know there was hardly anybody
[1:05:47] that knew what I was struggling with,
[1:05:49] but
[1:05:51] God is good.
[1:06:06] Hallelujah.
[1:06:08] &gt;&gt; I'm a new creation.
[1:06:12] &gt;&gt; I'm a new creation.
[1:06:16] I'm a brand new man.
[1:06:24] Heat. Heat.
[1:06:25] [Music]
[1:06:31] [Music]
[1:06:36] creation.
[1:06:41] [Applause]
[1:06:43] &gt;&gt; Oh, I feel at the service.
[1:06:46] &gt;&gt; I don't know about you, but I'm I'm just
[1:06:48] h I'm just reveling
[1:06:50] &gt;&gt; in what God is doing.
[1:06:52] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:06:53] &gt;&gt; We don't know. We don't see everything
[1:06:55] that's taking place. But this uh I uh I
[1:06:59] asked brother Mark if he would give this
[1:07:01] testimony because
[1:07:04] this situation also had all the
[1:07:06] ingredients
[1:07:07] for a marvelous success and I wouldn't
[1:07:10] mention it but brother Mark has already
[1:07:13] mentioned it that was he had a wife that
[1:07:16] prayed for him and I know a little bit
[1:07:18] about that. I know a wee bit about the 4
[1:07:23] and 5 in the morning and the prayers
[1:07:26] that went on into the night and how she
[1:07:28] didn't talk to anybody and was very
[1:07:31] reluctant to talk to me and we emailed
[1:07:34] back and forth and I would just
[1:07:36] encourage her and uh and then uh God
[1:07:41] sovereignly and then when I thought it
[1:07:43] was so perfect element number two is she
[1:07:48] said say to her husband to brother Mark,
[1:07:51] why don't you just start listening to
[1:07:52] some messages,
[1:07:55] &gt;&gt; had confidence in that word that was
[1:07:58] coming forth
[1:07:59] &gt;&gt; and heard the prophet speak, heard his s
[1:08:02] his servants speak and just a sentence,
[1:08:06] God doesn't have to speak volumes of
[1:08:08] encyclopedias. He just has to speak a
[1:08:10] word
[1:08:11] &gt;&gt; and just a word anchors in there. And
[1:08:14] that brother Mark did that. That to me
[1:08:17] is element number two. And number three,
[1:08:21] he kept coming to church and gave God an
[1:08:24] opportunity. And if you wait long
[1:08:26] enough, the shepherd will bring you in.
[1:08:30] Hallelujah. And we give him praise.
[1:08:33] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Glory to God.
[1:08:36] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:08:37] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:08:38] &gt;&gt; Let's stand, shall we?
[1:08:41] Did we sing high and lift it up?
[1:08:43] We did.
[1:08:46] Okay, let's sing it once again, shall
[1:08:47] we?
[1:08:49] I am lifted up with all his glory.
[1:08:55] [Music]
[1:08:57] I am lifted up in roses,
[1:09:04] coming back to rule and reign forever.
[1:09:11] [Music]
[1:09:12] I lift it up in Jesus Christ.
[1:09:19] [Music]
[1:09:20] Amen. Our dear loving Lord Jesus,
[1:09:24] we are here tonight to give you thanks,
[1:09:28] &gt;&gt; to praise your name. We thank you for
[1:09:31] your servants, oh God, that have
[1:09:33] declared the word of truth. We thank you
[1:09:36] for this grand and glorious victory in
[1:09:40] our brother Mark Neighbor's life. And on
[1:09:43] behalf of sister Elizabeth, his wife,
[1:09:45] and how they hung fast to your promises
[1:09:49] that you have spoken it. And Lord, I
[1:09:52] thank you for the moment he responded
[1:09:54] and that we have this testimony tonight.
[1:09:57] We can say of a truth, Jesus Christ, the
[1:10:00] same yesterday, today, and forever. You
[1:10:04] delivered the maniac out of the tombs,
[1:10:06] oh God. And you have delivered, oh God,
[1:10:08] each one of us from our life of death
[1:10:11] and desperation. And here we are tonight
[1:10:14] redeemed by the blood of the lamb. Lord,
[1:10:17] be with us since we are soon are
[1:10:19] approaching the Lord's table. In in your
[1:10:22] name, we ask that you will anoint your
[1:10:23] word. Anoint me as I stand here before
[1:10:26] your people who you purchased that day
[1:10:29] at Calvary. in Jesus Christ's name.
[1:10:32] Amen. Amen. I'm going to read a few
[1:10:35] scriptures with you out of Philippians
[1:10:38] the 2 chapter starting at verse 4 down
[1:10:41] through verse 9. We're carrying on from
[1:10:44] this morning.
[1:10:46] Did you enjoy this morning? Was it all
[1:10:48] right?
[1:10:54] And
[1:10:59] look not every man on his own things,
[1:11:02] but every man also on the things of
[1:11:04] others. Let this mind be in you which
[1:11:07] was also in Christ Jesus, who being in
[1:11:11] the form of God, thought it not robbery
[1:11:14] to be equal with God, but made himself
[1:11:18] of no reputation, and took upon him the
[1:11:21] form of a servant, and was made in the
[1:11:24] likeness of men. And being found in
[1:11:27] fashion as a man, he humbled himself,
[1:11:31] and became obedient unto death, even the
[1:11:34] death of the cross. Wherefore God also
[1:11:38] hath highly exalted him, and given him a
[1:11:42] name which is above every name.
[1:11:45] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:11:46] &gt;&gt; And we bless that name.
[1:11:48] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:11:48] &gt;&gt; You may be seated.
[1:11:54] We see as Jesus is approaching this
[1:11:59] latter part, the very la latter part of
[1:12:01] his life which was moving towards the
[1:12:04] cross. I believe it's only two three
[1:12:06] weeks ago. We mentioned how many
[1:12:09] prophecies there was concerning Christ's
[1:12:11] coming. How many prophecies there were
[1:12:14] concerning his ministry? I think about
[1:12:17] eight or nine in one case. Uh six or
[1:12:19] seven on the other case. 29
[1:12:23] prophecies were fulfilled from the Old
[1:12:26] Testament. 29 were fulfilled concerning
[1:12:29] his crucifixion and and uh and the
[1:12:32] suffering in that time. So as we see and
[1:12:36] observe the spirit of God, the spirit
[1:12:40] that was in Christ moving him through
[1:12:45] this last uh process of his life. And
[1:12:49] this is really truly the uh what I am
[1:12:53] referring to as the increase. How the
[1:12:56] son of man he was known as a son of man
[1:12:59] because he was the god prophet. How he
[1:13:02] increased it was such a rapid increase
[1:13:04] as it was to the fulfilling and the
[1:13:07] perfection of his of his ministry and
[1:13:10] what he was called on earth to do. And I
[1:13:13] will say that Jesus increased. He
[1:13:16] increased. We're not so concerned about
[1:13:18] the the uh uh how quick it was,
[1:13:23] &gt;&gt; how rapid it was, but we are concerned
[1:13:26] about what happened. And what really
[1:13:28] happened is he took this uh body of clay
[1:13:33] which as I spoke this morning when God
[1:13:36] sowed uh uh sowed by word by spoken word
[1:13:40] swed it in the earth and gave promise
[1:13:42] and that which was in the patriarchs and
[1:13:45] in the prophets throughout the old
[1:13:47] testament and how those fibrous roots of
[1:13:49] the tree of life took hold and he
[1:13:52] planted them in the earth and he grew
[1:13:54] and grew and then finally that word the
[1:13:56] prophet said that those those pro
[1:13:59] prophesied words a virgin shall
[1:14:01] conceive. Said the word of that prophet
[1:14:03] lodged in the womb of a virgin. Now
[1:14:07] that's not poetic language. That's what
[1:14:09] happened. She had a physical happening
[1:14:13] when she believed the word of the angel.
[1:14:16] &gt;&gt; Let it be unto me according to thy word.
[1:14:19] He said, "And the Holy Spirit shall
[1:14:22] overshadow you, and that which is
[1:14:24] conceived in thee is of the Holy Ghost."
[1:14:27] And she had a physical happening that
[1:14:30] took place in her by believing the word
[1:14:33] of God. So, the word was the seed before
[1:14:36] it was here. And that was the seed of
[1:14:39] the woman that would bruise the
[1:14:41] serpent's head and came forth uh for the
[1:14:45] prophet also speaks that you know uh
[1:14:48] Mary ate food like any any one of us
[1:14:51] eats food and as a mother eats food and
[1:14:54] the and the child in the womb is calling
[1:14:56] for certain things and the child is
[1:14:58] nourished and she ate food from the
[1:15:00] earth and the body of the Lord Jesus
[1:15:03] Christ. Here the seed of God is taking
[1:15:07] the elements of the earth which is of
[1:15:10] the earth which had been cursed. He's
[1:15:13] taking that cursed earth creating a body
[1:15:16] for himself came out in a natural birth
[1:15:19] in into this world and took this body of
[1:15:23] earth right up to the cross. But not
[1:15:26] only that, he matured and increased
[1:15:28] until that body he took that earth right
[1:15:31] through to a change. Hallelujah.
[1:15:35] &gt;&gt; Glory.
[1:15:35] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:15:36] &gt;&gt; Amen. What a hope. He took it right
[1:15:38] through to a change. And when they went
[1:15:40] to the tomb to find that body that he
[1:15:42] lived in, that body wasn't there.
[1:15:47] &gt;&gt; And the prophet said, when he came up
[1:15:48] out of the water, pointing to the
[1:15:50] scripture, when he came out of the
[1:15:52] water, had been baptized, and that voice
[1:15:55] said, "This is my beloved son in whom
[1:15:57] I'm well pleased." The prophet puts it
[1:16:00] in this language. This is the first part
[1:16:02] of the earth that I have redeemed.
[1:16:05] &gt;&gt; Amen. Hallelujah. And through this part
[1:16:08] of the earth that I have redeemed, I'll
[1:16:10] redeem them all.
[1:16:12] &gt;&gt; Glory to God.
[1:16:13] &gt;&gt; Isn't that marvelous?
[1:16:16] And so now he's moving moving up and the
[1:16:20] and and John the Baptist when he
[1:16:22] introduced Christ, he told his disciples
[1:16:26] and told his hearers, "He must increase
[1:16:30] and I must decrease." The truth of the
[1:16:33] matter is if he does increase, you will
[1:16:36] decrease.
[1:16:39] &gt;&gt; You will decrease.
[1:16:42] And when he said he he must he must
[1:16:45] increase
[1:16:49] the increase in the Hebrew word which is
[1:16:52] used or rather the Greek word which is
[1:16:54] used in this case.
[1:16:57] It has a really a strange reference and
[1:17:00] you'll need to think about it for
[1:17:01] perhaps just a moment. But the word in
[1:17:04] the Greek to increase is to beat
[1:17:10] forward or to lengthen it out by
[1:17:13] hammering.
[1:17:16] This increase
[1:17:18] as a son of man Jesus Christ was
[1:17:20] increasing. It didn't come by living on
[1:17:24] easy street.
[1:17:26] &gt;&gt; It didn't come by ease
[1:17:30] &gt;&gt; and setting back. It didn't come on a
[1:17:34] bed of roses.
[1:17:35] &gt;&gt; It didn't come his increase. And that's
[1:17:38] the son of man,
[1:17:40] &gt;&gt; Jesus Christ, who we say is in us.
[1:17:42] &gt;&gt; And if he's going to increase, it's not
[1:17:44] on easy street that it happens. It's
[1:17:47] coming through perhaps difficulties and
[1:17:50] obstacles and hurdles and
[1:17:52] misunderstandings and all kinds of other
[1:17:55] things that comes by our way. But by
[1:17:58] that constant pounding, whether it be
[1:18:01] from the world or whether it be from
[1:18:03] anyone, whether it be from family or
[1:18:05] friends or associates or whatever more,
[1:18:08] God allows it.
[1:18:09] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And it's increasing us. It's
[1:18:12] lengthening it out. It's bringing it to
[1:18:15] its destination
[1:18:19] &gt;&gt; to lengthen it by hammering as a smith
[1:18:22] forges the metals to promote and to
[1:18:26] forward and to bring it further to go
[1:18:29] forward to advance to proceed in time.
[1:18:33] And we're advancing in time also. We are
[1:18:36] creatures of time but we're advancing by
[1:18:39] the things that we endure. And the
[1:18:42] scripture says, "He that endureth to the
[1:18:44] end." What's it indicating? That it's
[1:18:47] not it's not just, you know, drifting
[1:18:49] through life in some kind of easy vein
[1:18:52] or channel. We must expect that this
[1:18:55] Christian walk is a battle. Can you say
[1:18:57] amen? This Christian walk is to be a
[1:19:00] struggle because we're struggling
[1:19:02] against waring against all kinds of
[1:19:05] principalities and darkness and powers
[1:19:07] of darkness. That's what the scripture
[1:19:09] says. Put you on therefore the whole
[1:19:12] armor of God.
[1:19:13] &gt;&gt; That's why I'm preaching tonight. Put on
[1:19:16] the whole armor of God that you might be
[1:19:18] able to withstand
[1:19:20] &gt;&gt; in the evil day. And this is the evil
[1:19:22] day.
[1:19:26] For the day is far spent,
[1:19:29] to increase and to make progress.
[1:19:33] And it comes from a root word
[1:19:36] to increase. And the word is copto. And
[1:19:40] copto is to be whale and to lament and
[1:19:43] to cut down, to whail and to mourn. And
[1:19:46] he was indeed. He cried out in the
[1:19:49] garden as the spirit was to leave him.
[1:19:52] And he had to go from Gethsemane to
[1:19:54] Calvary as a man. And as that spirit, he
[1:19:58] cried out, "If it be possible,
[1:20:01] if there's any possibility, let this cup
[1:20:04] pass from me. Nevertheless, not my will,
[1:20:07] but thine be done." And I tell you from
[1:20:09] there to the Calvary and what he
[1:20:10] suffered through then from that time it
[1:20:13] was a bitter cup and he and he drank it
[1:20:16] for you and I and I say glory to his
[1:20:19] name.
[1:20:20] &gt;&gt; But he also we are the scripture says
[1:20:23] that we are partakers of his sufferings.
[1:20:26] &gt;&gt; Amen. We are to expect that. And if we
[1:20:29] expect an easy life and just to make our
[1:20:32] way through this, you know, God will uh
[1:20:35] you may well be able to do that. But if
[1:20:37] you're going to be a real victorious
[1:20:39] believer, you got to be prepared. This
[1:20:42] is a battle. I'm in a battle. And the
[1:20:44] prophet says, "We battle every inch of
[1:20:46] it."
[1:20:47] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:20:50] &gt;&gt; Now, when it said he must, I'm just
[1:20:53] going to He said he must increase. He
[1:20:57] must. And I want to take this word he
[1:21:00] must. It is not merely that it is
[1:21:02] necessary
[1:21:04] or there is a need but also he must
[1:21:07] because it's right, it's correct, it's
[1:21:10] proper, he must increase and I must
[1:21:14] decrease because it's important because
[1:21:17] it's necessary that we decrease.
[1:21:22] &gt;&gt; It's a necessity.
[1:21:26] And
[1:21:28] I find that the language which is used,
[1:21:30] the language which God has chosen is so
[1:21:33] unique. It's not only that he must
[1:21:37] increase, not only that it's necessary
[1:21:39] and I must decrease, but that but that
[1:21:43] word must also comes from a root word
[1:21:46] where even it comes to bonds to fasten
[1:21:50] with chains. We are bound. That word of
[1:21:53] the scriptures, that word of God which
[1:21:56] is declared, he must increase and he
[1:22:00] that one he is dwelling in us and I must
[1:22:06] decrease.
[1:22:07] We don't only merely have a mental
[1:22:10] ascent to that. But if we are indeed
[1:22:14] believers, then we believe it even to
[1:22:16] the point of bonds. I am bound to this
[1:22:20] word.
[1:22:22] &gt;&gt; And and and the prophet speaks about the
[1:22:24] apostle Paul. Paul a prisoner of Jesus
[1:22:29] Christ. What was he referring to? This
[1:22:31] very phrase.
[1:22:32] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:22:33] &gt;&gt; Referring to he must increase. I am
[1:22:37] bound to that
[1:22:39] &gt;&gt; word. He must be preached
[1:22:42] &gt;&gt; in the far corners of I must take this
[1:22:45] gospel. I am a debtor. He knew that he'd
[1:22:48] been called. He knew that he had been
[1:22:50] commissioned. And he was bound by that
[1:22:53] word. It wasn't just a phrase in his
[1:22:56] mind that this gospel must be preached.
[1:22:58] It must be preached. And he was bound to
[1:23:01] that. And oh, how the prophet says that
[1:23:04] we would be prisoners.
[1:23:07] &gt;&gt; What a blessed thing to be prisoners to
[1:23:09] the word of God tonight.
[1:23:13] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:23:26] in a message, let your light so shine
[1:23:28] before men.
[1:23:32] Prophet says, and we're coming to
[1:23:34] communion in a little bit, but he said,
[1:23:36] "For I truly think that is the duty of
[1:23:39] every Christian to take communion."
[1:23:42] Now, I'm going to take this from an
[1:23:44] approach, and you may think that I am
[1:23:46] somewhat fanatical about it, and that's
[1:23:48] okay, however you want to feel about it.
[1:23:52] But I'm going to take this, he said,
[1:23:55] it's the duty of every Christian to take
[1:23:57] communion. The Bible said, "If you take
[1:23:59] this not, then you have no part with
[1:24:01] me." And I believe that it is a showdown
[1:24:04] time for the Christians. If we do not
[1:24:07] take it, we have no part with him. And
[1:24:08] if we take it unworthily, then we're
[1:24:11] guilty of the body and death of Christ.
[1:24:14] God forbid that anyone here would take
[1:24:16] it unworthily. So we come with with just
[1:24:21] deathbed sincerity and earnestness, do
[1:24:24] we not?
[1:24:24] &gt;&gt; People take this so glibly.
[1:24:28] &gt;&gt; Sometime doesn't hardly mean anything.
[1:24:30] Some soda crackers and grape juice and
[1:24:33] who cares what it is.
[1:24:35] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:24:37] But we care.
[1:24:40] &gt;&gt; We care.
[1:24:41] &gt;&gt; He said, "So it gets to a place where it
[1:24:43] keeps the Christian prayed up. So when
[1:24:46] he comes to communion, we should come
[1:24:49] reverently and solemnly, sacredly
[1:24:53] walking up, confessing all of our
[1:24:55] wrongs, praying one for another." Not
[1:24:58] only that, he said we should feel if
[1:25:01] there's a brother or a sister among us
[1:25:03] that we feel is just a little bit out of
[1:25:06] line. somewhere. Our hearts ought to be
[1:25:09] burdened for that person on communion
[1:25:13] night especially to see them that
[1:25:16] they'll that they'll be able to walk up
[1:25:19] and take communion and not be condemned
[1:25:21] with the world because they are our
[1:25:24] brothers and sisters. I can I can I can
[1:25:27] say that probably we don't usually come
[1:25:31] to the communion table with that kind of
[1:25:33] a burden. But that kind of a burden when
[1:25:36] we think or see or know someone that's
[1:25:39] not quite in line or we feel they're not
[1:25:42] quite that we become so burdened for
[1:25:44] them. Oh God, don't let anything stand
[1:25:47] in their way.
[1:25:49] &gt;&gt; Oh God, don't let anything condemn them.
[1:25:52] Let that be cleared out. work with them,
[1:25:55] deal with them, speak to them so they
[1:25:57] can come and partake of the communion
[1:25:59] table. That's what that's what the
[1:26:01] prophet's saying. That should be amongst
[1:26:02] us.
[1:26:04] &gt;&gt; Not one here, not one there, but it
[1:26:06] should be amongst us. That's the kind of
[1:26:08] spirit that should prevail. And I was
[1:26:11] determined tonight to unload my heart
[1:26:14] and preach my heart. This should not
[1:26:16] just be one or two or the minister, the
[1:26:18] deacons, or whatever more. This is for
[1:26:20] everybody. And everybody should say,
[1:26:22] "Amen." Amen.
[1:26:24] &gt;&gt; So be it.
[1:26:26] &gt;&gt; Men, women, husbands, wives, young
[1:26:29] people, whoever we are.
[1:26:32] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:26:35] Now, as Jesus is coming to this latter
[1:26:39] part of his ministry
[1:26:42] and as I referred to this morning and
[1:26:44] God speaking on the mount
[1:26:45] transfiguration,
[1:26:47] this is my beloved son in whom I'm well
[1:26:50] pleased. Hear ye him. It is spoken also
[1:26:53] in the in Hebrews,
[1:26:56] who in the days of his flesh,
[1:26:59] when he had offered up prayers and
[1:27:01] supplications with strong crying and
[1:27:05] tears,
[1:27:08] unto him that was able to save him from
[1:27:10] death, and was heard in that he feared.
[1:27:14] And though he wear a son, yet learned he
[1:27:18] obedience by the things which he
[1:27:20] suffered. And being made perfect, being
[1:27:25] made complete, being made perfect, he
[1:27:29] became the author of eternal salvation
[1:27:31] unto them that obeyed him. He was always
[1:27:34] without sin.
[1:27:36] &gt;&gt; But he yet as a son, he had to m become
[1:27:39] matured and he became matured by the
[1:27:42] things which he suffered. It doesn't say
[1:27:45] that he was made complete when the
[1:27:47] people ran out with branches to make him
[1:27:50] king and the people took off their coats
[1:27:52] and put their garments down on the path
[1:27:55] so that the little donkey could ride
[1:27:57] over them. That isn't what made him
[1:27:59] complete.
[1:28:00] &gt;&gt; But it was when people misunderstood
[1:28:02] him, when people accused him, when
[1:28:05] people cast uh nasty things in his teeth
[1:28:08] and spit upon him, he was made perfect.
[1:28:11] Why was he made perfect? because he had
[1:28:14] the opportunity to prove then that he
[1:28:17] had that character of the son of God.
[1:28:21] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:28:24] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:28:26] &gt;&gt; That's when you have the opportunity.
[1:28:27] And that's where we don't want to fail.
[1:28:30] &gt;&gt; That's when we don't want to fail. We're
[1:28:33] not talking about when you are able to
[1:28:35] embrace one another and you're around
[1:28:37] friends and you shake hands and uh
[1:28:39] whether it be young people or whoever.
[1:28:41] We all got our little uh association of
[1:28:43] friends. We got those that we really get
[1:28:46] along easy with and and we we that's not
[1:28:49] what that's not what develops your
[1:28:51] character.
[1:28:53] &gt;&gt; That's not what develops your character.
[1:28:55] &gt;&gt; It's that one that might be in the world
[1:28:58] or wherever they are rub you the wrong
[1:29:01] way. make you bite your tongue. You just
[1:29:05] want to give them a piece of your mind.
[1:29:07] It's then that God gives you an
[1:29:10] opportunity to prove you're a son and
[1:29:12] daughter of God.
[1:29:16] &gt;&gt; That's when and that is why the
[1:29:18] scripture says that things will wax
[1:29:20] worse and worse in the world. Why?
[1:29:23] Because the the bride of Jesus Christ,
[1:29:26] I'll declare it according to God's word,
[1:29:28] is going to shine brighter and brighter
[1:29:30] and become stronger. And she's going to
[1:29:32] increase
[1:29:34] &gt;&gt; and is increasing.
[1:29:37] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. We talk about a rapture. A
[1:29:39] rapture is for people that have
[1:29:40] increased.
[1:29:42] If if if the son of man, Jesus Christ,
[1:29:46] if he was made perfect, complete by the
[1:29:48] things which he suffered and that one is
[1:29:51] living in you now, he's not going to
[1:29:53] change his system.
[1:29:55] &gt;&gt; He's not going to change the order.
[1:29:56] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:29:58] &gt;&gt; You follow me?
[1:29:59] &gt;&gt; He's not going to he's not going to put
[1:30:01] it in reverse. It's the same one that's
[1:30:03] living in us. And he he in us is made
[1:30:07] complete for this age
[1:30:10] &gt;&gt; by the world that we are in and what it
[1:30:12] is that we endure and what it is that we
[1:30:14] suffer.
[1:30:18] &gt;&gt; You know some people
[1:30:21] including myself we have difficulty with
[1:30:23] our hardships. I'm talking about
[1:30:24] hardships things that grind you down
[1:30:27] fine. But tonight, after hearing what
[1:30:30] I'm saying, you should open your mouth
[1:30:33] and say, "God, I thank you for those
[1:30:36] difficulties. I thank you for those
[1:30:38] steep mountains. I thank you for those
[1:30:40] boisterous waters. I thank you for the
[1:30:42] time when I didn't know whether I was up
[1:30:44] or down. I thank you for that."
[1:30:48] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:30:49] &gt;&gt; I look over this audience and I see I I
[1:30:51] see those that I've sat and talked to
[1:30:54] and fellowshipped with. I know a little
[1:30:56] bit about your your your earlier life.
[1:30:58] I'm not talking about life and sin. I'm
[1:31:00] talking about the hardships, what you've
[1:31:02] gone through and you've had great
[1:31:04] upsets.
[1:31:05] &gt;&gt; You've had all kinds of things that have
[1:31:08] been such a great hardship to you.
[1:31:11] You've had people turn away from you.
[1:31:13] You've had to leave family. Those of you
[1:31:14] that have been in the callings, what's
[1:31:16] it like to leave a mother,
[1:31:19] &gt;&gt; to leave a father?
[1:31:20] &gt;&gt; I tell you what, that grinds a person's
[1:31:23] soul. that makes a man or a woman stand
[1:31:26] up and realize either she is more
[1:31:29] precious or I found another one that is
[1:31:32] more precious.
[1:31:34] &gt;&gt; I found one who's a lily of the valley.
[1:31:37] I found one who's a rose of Sharon. I
[1:31:40] found one who's fairer than 10,000. And
[1:31:43] I'm ready to leave all and everything to
[1:31:46] follow him.
[1:31:49] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And that when that ground
[1:31:52] down in your heart, that gave you
[1:31:55] opportunity to increase and the son of
[1:31:59] man increasing within you and coming to
[1:32:01] a a fullness and to a maturity to a more
[1:32:04] perfectly developed, fully developed.
[1:32:07] That's what it is. He was made complete.
[1:32:09] He was made fully developed
[1:32:13] in his character. And the dictionary
[1:32:15] says approaching perfection.
[1:32:19] Hallelujah.
[1:32:25] &gt;&gt; Now,
[1:32:27] I'd like you to observe closely
[1:32:31] and consider deeply
[1:32:39] this moment as Christ is coming. I want
[1:32:41] to bring I'm going to bring just a nub
[1:32:43] of my service to you now because I don't
[1:32:45] want to
[1:32:47] I don't want to delay the service
[1:32:49] unduly.
[1:32:55] One of the great marvels
[1:32:57] as I pondered this
[1:33:00] crucifixion and and the Christ time of
[1:33:02] suffering. One of the great marvels.
[1:33:05] Now remember, I'm not speaking about
[1:33:07] Christ's crucifixion and suffering just
[1:33:10] 2,000 years ago. I'm speaking about him
[1:33:13] living in you. That same Christ, not
[1:33:15] another one. That same one. All that was
[1:33:18] in Christ is now where?
[1:33:22] &gt;&gt; It's in us.
[1:33:24] &gt;&gt; In the bride. All that was in him is now
[1:33:27] in you.
[1:33:29] Not some leftover outside. All that was
[1:33:31] in him was in you. All that was in God
[1:33:34] is poured into Christ.
[1:33:36] &gt;&gt; All that was in Christ is poured now
[1:33:38] into you. And the process has not been
[1:33:41] reversed. It's the same process.
[1:33:44] It was his turn at one time. Now it's
[1:33:47] our turn.
[1:33:51] &gt;&gt; And as he moved to this time, he had
[1:33:55] suffered so many things
[1:33:57] from friend and foe alike.
[1:34:04] And yet he could come to a point
[1:34:08] after which
[1:34:12] he had experienced and I'm going to just
[1:34:15] relate some of them.
[1:34:19] Jesus in the garden
[1:34:21] forsaken
[1:34:25] when the soldiers came.
[1:34:27] Jesus in the garden betrayed with a
[1:34:31] kiss.
[1:34:34] Jesus in the garden. And the scripture
[1:34:36] says, "Then his disciples fled and left
[1:34:40] him."
[1:34:45] Jesus before his accusers, I'm talking
[1:34:47] about Jesus now, before his accusers,
[1:34:53] never once uttered or responded
[1:34:56] in an ill- fashion or wrongly.
[1:34:59] Sometimes there was something said it
[1:35:01] was very direct, could have been very
[1:35:03] sharp, but it was not to be snide
[1:35:08] or to be facitious
[1:35:10] or to be sarcastic.
[1:35:13] He never tried to degrade them. He was
[1:35:16] submitting himself. He was a prisoner to
[1:35:19] the word and the promise
[1:35:21] &gt;&gt; that was spoken of him.
[1:35:25] &gt;&gt; Jesus at the cross and before his
[1:35:28] smiters.
[1:35:30] He held no grudge.
[1:35:34] He sought no sympathy.
[1:35:37] He wasn't on a telephone, if they had
[1:35:39] one back then, trying to get sympathy
[1:35:42] from someone.
[1:35:45] &gt;&gt; He held his peace
[1:35:48] and his strongest reprimands that he
[1:35:52] ever gave was for the lack of faith.
[1:35:57] &gt;&gt; With the passing of time, we all collect
[1:36:00] baggage. But I want to give an example
[1:36:03] of our supreme example of Jesus Christ.
[1:36:06] You've been hurt.
[1:36:09] You've had friends who have left you.
[1:36:12] You've been insulted.
[1:36:15] You perhaps have been even lodged a
[1:36:18] grudge.
[1:36:20] You've had those kind of things. You've
[1:36:23] been wounded.
[1:36:26] &gt;&gt; Some for the gospel perhaps, some not
[1:36:28] for necessarily the gospel. We all have
[1:36:31] had we've been misunderstood as I spoke
[1:36:34] of Joseph. We've been perhaps disliked
[1:36:36] and even hated.
[1:36:39] &gt;&gt; All of these things a true believer will
[1:36:42] experience. But now here's our supreme
[1:36:45] example. And he's moving up. He's
[1:36:46] increasing in his maturity to his
[1:36:49] finality to his perfection. When I say
[1:36:52] perfection, I'm talking about
[1:36:54] completion.
[1:36:55] And when he got there,
[1:36:59] he held nothing against any of these,
[1:37:03] &gt;&gt; but was able to say,
[1:37:07] he was able to say that one that is in
[1:37:10] you was able to say in all truth,
[1:37:16] Father,
[1:37:18] forgive them,
[1:37:20] &gt;&gt; for they know not what they do.
[1:37:24] That to me is Christ
[1:37:28] &gt;&gt; increased.
[1:37:30] &gt;&gt; And this is not a story of 2,000 years
[1:37:32] ago. This happens to be March the 26th.
[1:37:36] That's a service for now. This is where
[1:37:38] we're at.
[1:37:39] &gt;&gt; And this is the kind of congregation God
[1:37:42] is looking for. This is the kind of
[1:37:44] people God is expecting. These are the
[1:37:46] kind of sons and daughters that God is
[1:37:48] expecting. And I tell you that's the
[1:37:50] kind of congregation where the
[1:37:52] supernatural is happening on a regular
[1:37:54] basis.
[1:37:56] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen?
[1:37:57] &gt;&gt; Can you say Lord do that work in me.
[1:38:02] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Do that work in me.
[1:38:04] &gt;&gt; I pray that the Holy Spirit will so
[1:38:06] press this down upon you. Make it such a
[1:38:09] reality in your own being
[1:38:11] that you'll feel what I feel within my
[1:38:14] spirit
[1:38:16] in a thinking man's filter.
[1:38:20] Prophet said,
[1:38:23] "How do you like
[1:38:25] how do you like a thinking man's
[1:38:27] filter?" He asked the question,
[1:38:31] "When you go on the street to rub arms
[1:38:33] with the world tomorrow, brother,
[1:38:36] sister,
[1:38:38] have you got a thinking man's filter?"
[1:38:41] He says, "When that man calls you a holy
[1:38:44] roller, do you use a thinking man's
[1:38:46] filter?" He's just starting.
[1:38:49] And when somebody says something evil
[1:38:51] against you, do you have a thinking
[1:38:53] man's filter?
[1:38:56] Do good for evil. Pray for those that
[1:38:59] despitefully use you and those who
[1:39:02] persecute you, then you're breathing
[1:39:04] through a thinking man's filter. For if
[1:39:07] you love those just who love you as we
[1:39:12] shook one another's hand, that's dearly
[1:39:15] beloved in the Lord. That's good.
[1:39:18] But can you also love the unlovable?
[1:39:21] That's the thinking man's filter. Amen.
[1:39:24] &gt;&gt; That's the spirit of Christ in you,
[1:39:27] loving those who don't love you. And
[1:39:30] then you have a reward of God. But now,
[1:39:33] if you do it as a duty, you still
[1:39:35] haven't got the thinking man's filter.
[1:39:38] He says you're only up in the second
[1:39:40] cycle. And here I have highlighted.
[1:39:44] But if from your heart you really love
[1:39:47] him, then you're breathing through a
[1:39:50] thinking man's filter and it satisfies a
[1:39:53] holy man's taste.
[1:39:54] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:39:55] &gt;&gt; He says that you know from your heart
[1:39:59] you forgive everybody
[1:40:02] everything.
[1:40:03] So no matter what has taken place,
[1:40:08] &gt;&gt; that is a tall order.
[1:40:11] That's a tall order.
[1:40:13] might be beyond us right now. Might be
[1:40:16] beyond me. Might be beyond you, but it's
[1:40:20] not beyond you opening your mouth and
[1:40:22] saying, "God,
[1:40:24] &gt;&gt; that's beyond my understanding,
[1:40:27] but grant that."
[1:40:29] &gt;&gt; It has been spoken, let me have that.
[1:40:32] Let me possess that.
[1:40:34] &gt;&gt; Let's take brother Mark's example and
[1:40:36] just start feeding on the word. How can
[1:40:38] I get that? How can I obtain that? Just
[1:40:41] start feeding on that word, feeding that
[1:40:43] soul, feeding that inside man until we
[1:40:46] can be forgiving for everybody, for
[1:40:49] everything, whatever it might be.
[1:40:52] &gt;&gt; I like to see that church, that church
[1:40:54] is a powerhouse.
[1:40:57] &gt;&gt; That church is a powerhouse for God.
[1:41:00] &gt;&gt; That church will have Christ as a main
[1:41:02] theme in their talking, in their
[1:41:04] walking, in their worship, in every part
[1:41:06] of their life. That he will be the
[1:41:08] central theme. Hallelujah.
[1:41:13] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:41:18] He said, "We call," Paul said in
[1:41:19] Hebrews, "We call to remembrance the
[1:41:22] former days in which after you were
[1:41:24] illuminated, you endured a great flight
[1:41:27] of afflictions, partly whilst ye were
[1:41:30] made a gazing stop, both by the
[1:41:33] reproaches and afflictions, and partly
[1:41:35] whilst ye became companions of them that
[1:41:39] were so used. For you had compassion of
[1:41:42] me in my bonds, and took joyfully the
[1:41:46] spoiling of your goods, knowing in
[1:41:48] yourselves that ye have in heaven a
[1:41:50] better and an enduring substance. The
[1:41:53] spoiling, the actual plundering
[1:41:56] of your goods. The robbery is one of the
[1:42:00] meanings of it.
[1:42:04] We can have a lot of reasons.
[1:42:08] I thought if anyone had a reason to hold
[1:42:11] a grudge, it could have been to my Lord.
[1:42:20] &gt;&gt; We accumulate things.
[1:42:23] We all have.
[1:42:25] We accumulate baggage. We accumulate. We
[1:42:27] collect stuff. in our memory bank
[1:42:30] stores.
[1:42:33] Those times
[1:42:35] when we've been misunderstood or some
[1:42:37] friend withdrew from us
[1:42:40] or perhaps finally left you.
[1:42:44] Someone said something hurtful, a
[1:42:46] hurtful thing or spread a false
[1:42:48] accusation.
[1:42:50] Something was slanted so as to destroy
[1:42:52] your integrity.
[1:42:55] You might say, "Where do those things
[1:42:56] happen?" If you live for Christ, they
[1:42:58] will happen.
[1:42:59] &gt;&gt; They will happen. You don't know. You
[1:43:02] may have applied for some job, but some
[1:43:04] whisper out there. Oh, I think they're
[1:43:08] one of those, you know, fanatics.
[1:43:12] You may have lost your place, lost your
[1:43:14] opportunity, or whatever more. And I'm
[1:43:18] not only speaking this for what we may
[1:43:20] have experienced, but for what you may
[1:43:22] experience in the future. And when that
[1:43:25] time arrives that you can say before God
[1:43:30] there's not just with the lips but from
[1:43:32] the heart
[1:43:33] &gt;&gt; right
[1:43:34] &gt;&gt; there's nothing in my heart
[1:43:36] &gt;&gt; I can sit with that brother sit with
[1:43:38] that sister and there's nothing in my
[1:43:40] heart
[1:43:41] &gt;&gt; hallelujah that is the increased
[1:43:45] and friends we we are we don't only
[1:43:48] claim to be but we are believers of this
[1:43:50] message that's why we're here this
[1:43:53] message is not an it is not a diluted
[1:43:57] word. It's a very strong word.
[1:44:01] &gt;&gt; And if we feed on the body word of the
[1:44:03] son of man, we will become what we feed
[1:44:07] on. We will become that kind of a
[1:44:10] person.
[1:44:11] &gt;&gt; We will become that kind of a believer.
[1:44:14] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:44:15] &gt;&gt; And as I said this morning and I I
[1:44:17] repeat again tonight, you don't have to
[1:44:19] struggle with it. You have to feed on
[1:44:20] the right thing and receive it into the
[1:44:23] right atmosphere and it will bring forth
[1:44:25] of its own kind.
[1:44:27] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:44:32] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:44:33] &gt;&gt; Good.
[1:44:50] Jesus had an opportunity
[1:44:53] and I want to bring you to this part
[1:45:00] where Jesus said to his disciples,
[1:45:03] "If any man will come after me, let him
[1:45:07] deny himself and take up his cross and
[1:45:12] follow me."
[1:45:14] But the key to this verse is in the
[1:45:17] previous three verses. And the previous
[1:45:20] verses say this.
[1:45:22] From that time, listen closely now. From
[1:45:25] that time Jesus had arrived a certain
[1:45:28] moment. And from that time forth,
[1:45:32] that's when he began, Jesus began to
[1:45:34] show his disciples
[1:45:37] how he must go to Jerusalem
[1:45:39] and how he will suffer many things of
[1:45:42] the elders and the chief priests and the
[1:45:44] scribes and be killed and raised again
[1:45:48] the third day. And Peter took him took
[1:45:50] him and began to rebuke him and saying,
[1:45:53] "Be it far from thee, Lord. this shall
[1:45:56] not be unto thee.
[1:46:00] &gt;&gt; And Jesus turned at that wonderful word
[1:46:03] of encouragement from his faithful
[1:46:05] disciple Peter. Jesus turned and says,
[1:46:08] "Get behind me, Satan." That's
[1:46:09] &gt;&gt; right.
[1:46:11] &gt;&gt; Thou perceivest not. Thou savorest not
[1:46:14] the things of that be of God, but those
[1:46:17] that be of men. You're a man. You don't
[1:46:19] want to see me suffer. You don't want
[1:46:21] that to happen. But get behind me,
[1:46:23] Satan.
[1:46:29] And when they were trying to deliver him
[1:46:30] from it, he said, "But how then, if I'm
[1:46:34] delivered from this, and if you do this,
[1:46:36] how then must must the scriptures be
[1:46:41] fulfilled? I am bound to the scriptures.
[1:46:45] &gt;&gt; And in order for me to increase and
[1:46:48] fulfill this word, it is this pounding.
[1:46:51] It is this lengthening by this uh by
[1:46:54] this uh uh fulfillment of the scripture.
[1:46:57] It is this uh uh incredible weight
[1:47:00] that's upon me. Not only him, but I
[1:47:03] declare it'll be if we live where we're
[1:47:05] supposed to live. If we live the kind of
[1:47:07] lives and the kind of testimony, the
[1:47:09] kind of witness we are and we will
[1:47:11] experience these things. And we say we
[1:47:14] should say not my will, Father,
[1:47:16] &gt;&gt; but thine be done.
[1:47:19] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. God, give us a church full
[1:47:21] of people. God, grant us a church full
[1:47:24] of people. I tell you, those of you that
[1:47:27] live, I know what it's like living in
[1:47:29] your living at your job and living the
[1:47:31] kind of life that you're trying to make
[1:47:33] a living and you're trying to work with
[1:47:35] this world and you're rubbing shoulders
[1:47:36] with them and and whatever more and you
[1:47:39] men that are in business and you sisters
[1:47:41] with the school system or whatever more.
[1:47:43] We've got all kinds of things and Satan
[1:47:46] has so interwoven himself into the
[1:47:48] politics and into the education and into
[1:47:50] the entertainment part and every part,
[1:47:53] every aspect of life that we're
[1:47:55] constantly fighting and struggling and
[1:47:57] waring against those things. I say God
[1:48:00] bless you.
[1:48:02] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:48:04] &gt;&gt; God bless you. But keep your balance.
[1:48:07] Keep your balance and keep your eye
[1:48:09] solely upon the upon the goal. Amen.
[1:48:12] &gt;&gt; Is it making some sense to you this
[1:48:14] evening?
[1:48:18] &gt;&gt; And that is when Jesus said,
[1:48:21] "If any man will come after me, it's not
[1:48:24] just a a a a statement that he put out
[1:48:28] there to leave, but if any man come
[1:48:30] after me, let him deny himself." And I'm
[1:48:34] going to come to a close quickly. Let
[1:48:37] him deny himself.
[1:48:40] And that denying of himself
[1:48:43] is to affirm that one has no
[1:48:45] acquaintance or connection with someone.
[1:48:51] Hello.
[1:48:54] &gt;&gt; When Jesus said, "Let him deny himself,"
[1:48:57] that means you don't know yourself after
[1:49:00] the flesh.
[1:49:02] &gt;&gt; Paul said, "I know how many men?"
[1:49:05] &gt;&gt; No.
[1:49:06] &gt;&gt; No men.
[1:49:08] &gt;&gt; Was he a man?
[1:49:10] He had denied himself to such a degree
[1:49:13] that he didn't recognize the
[1:49:15] acquaintance of what a what Paul wanted.
[1:49:18] &gt;&gt; It was what God wanted.
[1:49:20] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:49:21] &gt;&gt; We deny ourselves. Doesn't mean we stop
[1:49:24] working. Doesn't mean we stop paying our
[1:49:25] bills. Doesn't mean that we get out of
[1:49:27] those things. But it is that we have
[1:49:28] another focus. Whatever the word has
[1:49:31] said that is to take place in this time,
[1:49:33] that has the preeminence.
[1:49:36] &gt;&gt; And we're a stranger to everything else.
[1:49:39] Hallelujah. When this flesh desires
[1:49:41] something or this uh we desire something
[1:49:43] that is outside and going to take us
[1:49:45] away from the main course of the word of
[1:49:48] God, deny it.
[1:49:54] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:49:55] &gt;&gt; There may be people that are listening
[1:49:57] on the internet. I don't know. I'm going
[1:50:00] to be very very straight.
[1:50:04] Myself personally,
[1:50:06] I moved to the city of Toronto. I didn't
[1:50:08] know anybody in that city of over 2
[1:50:10] million about 2 and a2 million then and
[1:50:13] I don't know what the population is
[1:50:14] today. The first thing I did I won't say
[1:50:18] the very first thing but one of the
[1:50:19] first things I did is I opened up the
[1:50:22] telephone book and I went to the yellow
[1:50:24] pages and I started looking for the
[1:50:26] churches asking God help me. I got to
[1:50:30] have a place where I can go to church. I
[1:50:32] have to have a place where I can
[1:50:34] worship. I have to have a place when my
[1:50:36] family arrives where I can take them.
[1:50:40] &gt;&gt; And the first place I laid my finger on,
[1:50:42] the first place I went to, it actually
[1:50:44] wasn't in the yellow pages, I'm sorry,
[1:50:45] it was in the Toronto Sun newspaper. And
[1:50:48] I went to that place. I went to that
[1:50:50] church and there was about 400 people
[1:50:51] from Newfoundland there. And those
[1:50:53] people were as straight laced and gun
[1:50:55] barrel straight as you could want. And I
[1:50:58] was in that church. We were there until
[1:51:00] until we were put out.
[1:51:04] Hallelujah.
[1:51:06] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:51:07] &gt;&gt; Who said hallelujah? Sister Ruth
[1:51:09] Frederick, God bless you.
[1:51:11] &gt;&gt; Sounds like you may have had that kind
[1:51:13] of experience.
[1:51:15] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:51:19] &gt;&gt; I better not get on to this because we
[1:51:21] want to come to communion. But I'll tell
[1:51:23] you what, I I was teaching this. I was
[1:51:26] teaching the senior Sunday school class.
[1:51:28] I was teaching the class of the young
[1:51:29] married couples which was the which the
[1:51:32] pastor had taught and and uh they'd
[1:51:34] asked me to take it so I said well fine
[1:51:36] okay and uh and uh I can't be even begin
[1:51:39] to tell you the whole thing but we were
[1:51:41] there and I was just in the foyer of the
[1:51:44] church getting ready to go one day and
[1:51:46] little we quiet brother
[1:51:49] he's just about like you brother David
[1:51:51] Law but your size and the way you're
[1:51:54] talking he said uh hey brother Bisco he
[1:51:57] said, "How how do you baptize?" Well, I
[1:52:00] didn't baptize anybody. I just church.
[1:52:03] He said, "How how do you baptize?" Well,
[1:52:06] I said, "Now that you asked me."
[1:52:09] I said, "I believe in baptizing in the
[1:52:11] name of the Lord Jesus Christ." Do you
[1:52:13] know what? That was just like dropping a
[1:52:15] bomb in that whole church. Why? That
[1:52:18] just went through there like a fire. And
[1:52:20] they sent they sent they sent the
[1:52:22] superintendent of the Sunday school over
[1:52:24] to me and said and he was all white and
[1:52:25] his lips was trembling and and his lips
[1:52:28] was trembling and he said, "Brother
[1:52:32] brother Piscll, I've been sent here on a
[1:52:34] terrible mission." I said, "You know,
[1:52:36] just relax. You know what can be so
[1:52:38] bad?" Oh, he said, "You you don't
[1:52:40] understand." I said, "No, no, it's it's
[1:52:42] all right. Just relax, Brother Ralph.
[1:52:44] You know what is it?" He said, "I've
[1:52:47] been asked I've been asked to have you
[1:52:49] resign." Oh. I said, 'Well, that's no
[1:52:52] problem. He said, 'How can you take it
[1:52:54] like that?
[1:52:56] And my wife was fixing supper and I
[1:52:58] said, "Well, let's have dinner." So, we
[1:53:00] had I think we had a dinner together or
[1:53:02] something. And he just couldn't even
[1:53:03] grasp it. But you know,
[1:53:06] you know what the Lord spoke to my
[1:53:07] heart? You believe God speaks?
[1:53:10] &gt;&gt; He told me, "Go right back there
[1:53:14] to church." the very next Sunday.
[1:53:18] &gt;&gt; And before that Sunday rolled around,
[1:53:21] all kinds of things had come back. And I
[1:53:24] had other brothers visit my house and
[1:53:26] they're ready to put up a fight. You
[1:53:28] know, they can't do this to you. They
[1:53:31] can't put you out. You stand up there
[1:53:33] and fight. I said, "No, no, Brother Joe.
[1:53:35] I'm not going to do that." Wasn't
[1:53:37] Brother Joe Walner, but
[1:53:39] his name was Brother Joe.
[1:53:42] No. I said, "No, not going to do that.
[1:53:46] But he said in my heart, "You go right
[1:53:48] back."
[1:53:50] And uh
[1:53:52] Sunday morning, just as regular as
[1:53:55] clockwork, we walked in the double doors
[1:53:58] and walked down the aisle. And I'll tell
[1:54:01] you what, if they had false teeth,
[1:54:03] they're ready to lose them right then.
[1:54:05] Their mouths just felt
[1:54:07] couldn't believe. Here we were just
[1:54:10] walking in. Walked right down where we
[1:54:12] always walk in. Sat down. sat right in
[1:54:14] our our seat and my class had gone back
[1:54:18] to the pastor who'd had it before.
[1:54:21] And uh so I filed up when the when the
[1:54:26] preliminaries closed. Well, I we filed
[1:54:28] up my wife and I and we happened to be
[1:54:30] kind of the last of the line. Everybody
[1:54:32] got up and the whole the whole large
[1:54:34] room where where this class was seated
[1:54:37] was all filled except the front seats.
[1:54:39] The just the front seats right in front.
[1:54:41] So, we were sitting right here and the
[1:54:43] pastor was so close. The pastor was
[1:54:46] about this close to us.
[1:54:49] I felt so sorry for him.
[1:54:53] I really did. I loved him dearly. And we
[1:54:55] would and we would get together and talk
[1:54:57] about Brother Brandham's message. He
[1:54:59] told me the greatest meetings I ever
[1:55:01] been in was in Brother Brandham's
[1:55:02] meetings down near Detroit in Flint,
[1:55:05] Michigan. I believe he was there in
[1:55:06] Windsor, Ontario. He's in those
[1:55:08] meetings. He said, "They're so
[1:55:09] outstanding." I said, 'Brother Ripley,
[1:55:11] we'd go fishing together. I said,
[1:55:12] 'Brother Ripley, why don't you just kick
[1:55:15] this whole denomination over in the
[1:55:16] ditch? And why don't you just forget the
[1:55:18] whole thing? And I was talking to him
[1:55:20] and his wife, and his name was Edgar, Ed
[1:55:23] Edgar Edwin or something. And and uh and
[1:55:26] his wife says, "Edwin, remember our
[1:55:30] pension?"
[1:55:35] The pension wasn't meaning to him. And
[1:55:38] as we sat there
[1:55:41] and his lips began to tremble terribly
[1:55:44] and he couldn't hardly get the words
[1:55:45] out, he said, "We will read the
[1:55:48] scripture text. We'll read it all
[1:55:50] together." I didn't know what the
[1:55:53] scripture text was cuz I wasn't teaching
[1:55:54] the class anymore. And they opened up
[1:55:56] the scripture text and guess what it
[1:55:57] was? I give it to you by memory. And
[1:56:00] they accused him of many things. And he
[1:56:02] answered them not a word.
[1:56:05] [Applause]
[1:56:08] I just had to do believe
[1:56:12] I tell you the son of man was growing.
[1:56:15] He was increasing little by little but
[1:56:17] I'm glad I had enough for that moment
[1:56:19] and I had been accused of many things
[1:56:22] but I never said a word. I got a I you
[1:56:25] know, brother George DST and Sister
[1:56:28] Felina
[1:56:30] with their kids were sitting in that
[1:56:32] same church while we were there. Only
[1:56:35] trouble was we had two different
[1:56:37] leadings. They sat on one side of the
[1:56:39] church, we sat on the other side of the
[1:56:41] church. We didn't even know it till all
[1:56:42] these years later and here they come
[1:56:44] here and we found out we sat in the same
[1:56:46] church.
[1:56:48] But that pastor, Brother Ripley, sent me
[1:56:51] a letter about seven pages and told me,
[1:56:55] he says, "Brother Ed, I never felt more
[1:56:58] comfortable
[1:57:00] than when I was away
[1:57:03] and had the had you in the pulpit to
[1:57:05] take my place. I was never so
[1:57:07] comfortable." And he told me, "I have
[1:57:10] left that organization
[1:57:12] and I am independent now." I thank God.
[1:57:15] He was a wonderful man. and I really
[1:57:17] appreciated him. But oh, I'm so glad,
[1:57:19] friends. I'm glad even though you got
[1:57:21] put out even though he got rejected. Was
[1:57:23] it easy? No, it was one of the hardest
[1:57:25] things of our lives. And there I just
[1:57:27] had a young family, you know, we're
[1:57:28] trying to find another place.
[1:57:31] I said, "We got to go to church." I
[1:57:32] don't know how desperate you are. We got
[1:57:33] to go to church and worship. The next
[1:57:35] Sunday, we drove up to a church.
[1:57:38] We're going to go to church now. We've
[1:57:40] been there.
[1:57:43] Now we're going to go to another church.
[1:57:44] just I don't know, just a church in the
[1:57:46] area. We drive up to the church and
[1:57:49] you're not going to believe this, but
[1:57:50] you will after I tell you,
[1:57:53] there's a a dog uh a compound animal
[1:57:57] compound vehicle right in front of the
[1:57:59] church and a man was just getting out
[1:58:01] with a great big net or something and he
[1:58:04] was going to catch I said, "What are you
[1:58:06] doing?" He says, "I'm going to catch a
[1:58:07] dog." and he was up on the church steps
[1:58:10] going to catch this dog.
[1:58:13] And I'm going up the steps. I thought,
[1:58:14] "This is strange. We're trying to go to
[1:58:16] church. Here's a here's a dog catcher
[1:58:17] going to catch a dog." And we're just
[1:58:19] getting up on the steps and there's a
[1:58:21] big sign on the door. Meetings canled.
[1:58:24] Something went off wherever it was. And
[1:58:26] I said to my wife, "That's it. God's
[1:58:28] already told us. We just go back home."
[1:58:31] And we just started having services back
[1:58:34] home. And I'm happy to say that brother
[1:58:37] who asked me how we baptized and all the
[1:58:40] others that caused the whole stir,
[1:58:41] they're in a messy church today.
[1:58:44] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:58:47] Amen.
[1:58:52] We all have a cross.
[1:58:55] Brother Jake Dick, where are you?
[1:59:00] I want Brother Jake as we're getting
[1:59:02] ready for the communion now. Sorry. Was
[1:59:04] it all right to take this time? I want
[1:59:07] Brother Jake Dick to come and uh a song
[1:59:10] been on my heart all week and is going
[1:59:13] to lead us right into the communion now.
[1:59:16] And the song is
[1:59:19] uh take up thy cross and follow me. I
[1:59:22] hear the blessed savior say.
[1:59:26] And I don't know if they have the words
[1:59:28] to it to put it on the screen. You won't
[1:59:32] be singing it, but just listen to the
[1:59:33] words as uh brother Jake and whoever I
[1:59:35] left it to him to choose who would sing
[1:59:38] together.
[1:59:42] Oh, it's a beloved time, friends. It's a
[1:59:44] wonderful time. I'm just wanting to have
[1:59:46] these words for you.
[1:59:51] How many know that old song?
[1:59:54] Of course, I'm sure there's many of you.
[2:00:04] I want especially these words have a
[2:00:08] special meaning
[2:00:12] and whoever was inspired to write this
[2:00:14] song wrote it from the perspective of
[2:00:17] that he
[2:00:19] he encountered the Lord and they're a
[2:00:22] stranger journey too. Then in the second
[2:00:24] verse I cried Lord Jesus and he spoke my
[2:00:27] name. I saw his hands all bruised and
[2:00:29] torn. I stooped to kiss away the marks
[2:00:31] of shame, the shame for me that he had
[2:00:35] borne.
[2:00:36] "Oh, let me bear thy cross, dear Lord,"
[2:00:39] I cried. And lo, a cross for me
[2:00:41] appeared.
[2:00:42] "The one forgotten, I had cast aside,
[2:00:46] the one so long that I had feared. Let
[2:00:49] us not fear the cross. Let's deny
[2:00:52] ourselves and follow him." Amen. God
[2:00:54] bless you as you say.
[2:00:57] [Music]
[2:01:06] I walked
[2:01:09] one day along a country
[2:01:13] road
[2:01:15] and there
[2:01:17] a stranger journey too.
[2:01:21] [Music]
[2:01:23] stand low
[2:01:25] beneath the burden
[2:01:28] of his love.
[2:01:32] It was
[2:01:33] a cross, a cross I knew.
[2:01:40] Take up thy cross and follow me.
[2:01:48] I hear the blessed Savior call.
[2:01:56] How can
[2:01:58] I make a lesser sacriice
[2:02:04] when Jesus
[2:02:06] gave
[2:02:08] his all?
[2:02:12] I cried,
[2:02:14] Lord Jesus.
[2:02:16] And he spoke my name.
[2:02:20] I saw
[2:02:22] his hands all bruised and torn.
[2:02:28] I stooped
[2:02:30] to kiss away the marks of shame,
[2:02:36] the shame
[2:02:38] for me that he had borne.
[2:02:44] &gt;&gt; Take up thy cross and follow me.
[2:02:52] I hear the blessed Savior call.
[2:03:00] How can
[2:03:02] I make a lesser sacriice
[2:03:08] when Jesus
[2:03:10] gave
[2:03:12] his all?
[2:03:14] [Music]
[2:03:16] Oh, let me bear thy cross, dear Lord, I
[2:03:22] cry.
[2:03:24] And lo,
[2:03:26] a cross for me appear.
[2:03:31] The one
[2:03:33] forgotten I had cast aside.
[2:03:39] the one so long that I had fear.
[2:03:46] &gt;&gt; Take up thy cross and follow me.
[2:03:54] &gt;&gt; I hear the blessed savior call.
[2:04:02] How can I make a lesser sacriice
[2:04:10] when Jesus
[2:04:12] gave
[2:04:14] his
[2:04:18] cross
[2:04:20] I'll carry till the crown
[2:04:24] appears
[2:04:26] the way
[2:04:27] I journey soon we
[2:04:33] where God
[2:04:35] himself shall wipe away all tears
[2:04:41] and friend.
[2:04:43] Hold fellowship with friend.
[2:04:48] &gt;&gt; Take up thy cross and follow me.
[2:04:54] [Music]
[2:04:56] I hear the blessed savior call.
[2:05:02] [Music]
[2:05:04] How can I make a lesser sacriice
[2:05:11] when Jesus
[2:05:14] came?
[2:05:17] &gt;&gt; We're going to have you sing the chorus
[2:05:19] another time or two. I'm going to ask
[2:05:20] the deacons to come forward now if you
[2:05:22] would please as we approach the Lord's
[2:05:25] table.
[2:05:27] And this is the cross.
[2:05:30] I trust I was able to make myself clear
[2:05:32] in the services today.
[2:05:36] The bread that we'll be taking and the
[2:05:39] cup that we'll be drinking of. We are
[2:05:42] testifying in so doing that that life is
[2:05:47] here now tonight living in us. And I
[2:05:50] sought to describe that life what God
[2:05:53] allowed it to go through. And I say Lord
[2:05:55] Jesus whatever tomorrow holds you'll
[2:05:58] give me the strength, the stamina, the
[2:06:01] wisdom, whatever I need to live your
[2:06:03] life, not mine, your life. Amen. Take up
[2:06:07] thy cross and follow me.
[2:06:10] Take up thy cross.
[2:06:15] [Music]
[2:06:17] I hear the blessed savior.
[2:06:25] How can I make a lesser sacriice
[2:06:32] when Jesus
[2:06:36] is all
[2:06:40] take up
[2:06:42] my cross and follow me?
[2:06:48] I hear the blessed savior call.
[2:06:54] [Music]
[2:06:55] How can I make a sacriice
[2:07:03] when Jesus
[2:07:05] gave
[2:07:07] his all?
[2:07:10] &gt;&gt; Thank you, brother Jake, brother Peter,
[2:07:13] sister Brenda.
[2:07:17] reading our scripture
[2:07:19] in 1 Corinthians
[2:07:23] 11 and 23.
[2:07:26] For I have received of the Lord that
[2:07:29] which also I delivered unto you. And I'd
[2:07:33] like you to notice very closely the next
[2:07:35] line in conjun in connection with the
[2:07:38] services today. It spoke to me so
[2:07:42] directly this afternoon that the Lord
[2:07:45] Jesus
[2:07:46] the same night
[2:07:49] in which he was betrayed
[2:07:52] he took bread. He was still giving this
[2:07:56] is my body.
[2:07:58] &gt;&gt; In the same night that he was betrayed
[2:08:01] &gt;&gt; he took bread.
[2:08:03] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[2:08:04] &gt;&gt; Said this is my body.
[2:08:06] And when he had given thanks, he broke
[2:08:08] it and said, "Take, eat. This is my body
[2:08:11] which is broken for you. This do in
[2:08:14] remembrance of me." And after the same
[2:08:16] manner also, he took the cup, and when
[2:08:18] he had sucked, saying, "This cup is the
[2:08:20] new testament in my blood, this do ye,
[2:08:23] as often as you drink it in remembrance
[2:08:25] of me. For as often as ye eat this bread
[2:08:28] and drink this cup, you do show the
[2:08:31] Lord's death till he come. Wherefore
[2:08:33] whosoever shall eat this bread and drink
[2:08:36] this cup of the Lord unworthily shall be
[2:08:39] guilty of the body and the blood of the
[2:08:41] Lord. But let a man examine himself. And
[2:08:44] so let him eat of that bread and drink
[2:08:46] of that cup. For he that eateth and
[2:08:48] drinkkeeth unworthily eateth and
[2:08:50] drinkketh damnation to himself, not
[2:08:52] discerning the Lord's body. And for this
[2:08:55] cause many are weak and sickly among
[2:08:57] you, and many sleep. For if we would
[2:08:59] judge ourselves, we should not be
[2:09:01] judged. But when we are judged, we are
[2:09:04] chastened of the Lord, that we should
[2:09:06] not be condemned with the world.
[2:09:08] Wherefore, my brethren, when you come
[2:09:10] together to eat, tarry one for another,
[2:09:14] and if any man hunger, let him eat at
[2:09:16] home, that ye come not together under
[2:09:19] condemnation, and the rest will I set in
[2:09:21] order when I come. Wherefore, my
[2:09:23] brethren, when you come together
[2:09:26] together to eat, tar one for another.
[2:09:29] I'll have you just bow your head for a
[2:09:32] moment. I felt to do this before the
[2:09:34] brethren break the bread and before they
[2:09:36] pray over the bread.
[2:09:39] I'd like to just take a moment of
[2:09:40] silence now.
[2:09:43] Each one, let us examine our heart in
[2:09:46] light of the word that God laid on my
[2:09:49] heart for these services.
[2:09:51] Let us see ourselves
[2:09:54] in the light of what God would want us
[2:09:57] to be.
[2:09:59] And I know we may not measure up to that
[2:10:01] standard. We're not to set our own
[2:10:04] standard. But I'd like you to examine
[2:10:06] your heart. And if there's anything
[2:10:08] there that would be a miss with any
[2:10:12] family member, anyone within the church,
[2:10:16] anyone where you work or within your
[2:10:19] realm of association outside in the
[2:10:22] world that we would take the admonition
[2:10:26] of the word of God and as the prophet
[2:10:28] spelled it out so clearly, from our
[2:10:31] heart we forgive them and from our heart
[2:10:35] we hold nothing in our heart against
[2:10:38] anyone. Oh Lord Jesus,
[2:10:41] let the Holy Spirit now
[2:10:45] seek out and search every area of our
[2:10:47] heart. Lord
[2:10:51] turn on the great search light.
[2:10:54] Create in us, oh God, clean heart.
[2:10:59] Wash us with the water of the word as
[2:11:01] you have this day.
[2:11:04] We thank you for it. Thank you for this
[2:11:07] time now Lord before your table.
[2:11:12] Wonder Brother Don White would you ask
[2:11:16] the blessing upon and give thanks for
[2:11:20] the bread before it is broken.
[2:11:31] Gracious heavenly father, how he humbles
[2:11:33] us, Lord, to think, oh Lord, the one who
[2:11:37] created the heavens and the earth, the
[2:11:39] universe should so humble himself that
[2:11:42] he should become flesh to dwell among us
[2:11:45] to take the penalty of our sin upon you.
[2:11:48] Lord, we can only say, oh Lord, that we
[2:11:51] love you with all of our heart. those
[2:11:53] things that brother Ed spoke this
[2:11:55] morning. Oh Lord, when you declared, oh
[2:11:58] Lord, that it is finished and it was
[2:12:00] finished for a purpose that it would
[2:12:02] become life in your bride, Lord. May
[2:12:05] every aspect of your redemptive
[2:12:08] blessings, oh Lord, be uh manifest in
[2:12:11] your bride, Lord. Oh God, we just love
[2:12:14] you. We just, Lord, want to serve you
[2:12:17] with all of our hearts, oh God. Just
[2:12:19] ask, Father, as we partake of the bread
[2:12:22] this evening, how we think, oh Lord,
[2:12:24] that your body was broken for us, Lord,
[2:12:27] broken for our healing, broken for every
[2:12:30] redemptive blessing that we could
[2:12:32] partake of and enjoy, Lord. And we just
[2:12:35] thank you this evening, oh Lord. Just
[2:12:37] ask, Father, that you would bless the
[2:12:38] people as they partake of the bread now,
[2:12:40] Lord. We love you and we give you praise
[2:12:43] and thanks in Jesus Christ's lovely
[2:12:45] name. Amen.
[2:12:48] Maybe
[2:12:50] brethren, break the bread. As
[2:12:53] as you receive the bread for those of
[2:12:54] you that are
[2:12:56] uh perhaps visiting, we don't have a
[2:12:58] closed communion. If you are born again
[2:13:02] believer,
[2:13:03] you've believed on Lord Jesus Christ for
[2:13:06] your salvation, your redemption.
[2:13:08] We don't have, as the prophet said, we
[2:13:10] don't have a close communion. The
[2:13:12] communion is for the believers. If you
[2:13:14] would hold anything in your heart
[2:13:16] against anyone, then don't take it.
[2:13:20] Don't don't don't eat and drink
[2:13:22] damnation to yourself. But the scripture
[2:13:25] says that we wait on one another or we
[2:13:28] make those things right and we just ask
[2:13:30] God forgive us and then so let him eat.
[2:13:33] The scripture says that's what God
[2:13:35] intends for us to do. I would like to
[2:13:38] have you sing with me while the bread is
[2:13:41] being passed and you'll hold it and
[2:13:42] we'll all partake of it together. Lest I
[2:13:45] forget thine agony, lest I forget
[2:13:47] Gethsemane. Uh I wonder if we could just
[2:13:50] have that.
[2:13:52] [Music]
[2:13:54] I like to sing the verse, please. King
[2:13:56] of my life, I crown thee now.

[2:15:49] Lead me to Calary.
[2:15:54] &gt;&gt; I'll just allow you to have your seat
[2:15:56] now while the brethren are passing the
[2:15:58] bread through. It'll be a little bit
[2:16:00] easier and we'll go on with the song.
[2:16:03] Let me like Mary
[2:16:06] through the womb.
[2:16:10] Come with a gift to me.

[2:16:58] &gt;&gt; I'll have the congregation together.
[2:17:01] We will read these this next verse
[2:17:04] together.
[2:17:05] May I be willing, Lord, to bear daily my
[2:17:10] cross for thee, even thy cup of grief to
[2:17:15] share, thou hast borne all for me. Lest
[2:17:20] I forget.
[2:17:24] [Music]
[2:17:27] And lest I forget thy

[2:18:03] and
[2:18:05] smil

[2:18:15] [Music]
[2:18:18] Yes, I forget.
[2:18:21] [Music]
[2:18:26] I forget
[2:18:28] my
[2:18:32] le I forget my love for me.
[2:18:40] Lead me to Calary.
[2:18:46] &gt;&gt; When I survey the wondrous cross,
[2:18:52] [Music]
[2:18:53] these are such marvelous words in these
[2:18:57] songs. So appropriate for this time.
[2:19:01] [Music]
[2:19:03] You sense his presence.
[2:19:05] It's always a sweet presence.
[2:19:08] I just urge you now. We don't do this as
[2:19:11] some formality,
[2:19:13] but we do this in reality.
[2:19:16] It's a real experience.
[2:19:20] And you don't have to remember
[2:19:21] everything that was preached today, but
[2:19:22] if you would just say, Lord, what you
[2:19:25] inspired
[2:19:27] brother to speak, what you inspired him
[2:19:29] to speak, let it be my portion.
[2:19:32] Let that Christ that is in me increase,
[2:19:36] my friend.
[2:19:38] My precious brothers and sisters, you
[2:19:41] want to know what's in the inside of my
[2:19:42] heart right now? What I prayed for?
[2:19:45] Don't let the people leave at the same
[2:19:48] level they came in. Let them be
[2:19:51] determined and let them confess with
[2:19:52] their lips from the youngest to the
[2:19:54] eldest, God
[2:19:57] live in me.
[2:19:59] If those saints back there could have
[2:20:02] that force and that desire within them
[2:20:07] prior to the when the tree was planted
[2:20:11] on the day of Pentecost, that bride
[2:20:13] tree, if they could have that back
[2:20:15] there, surely now it is my portion at
[2:20:18] this late hour. How many believe it's
[2:20:21] harvest time? Amen.
[2:20:24] &gt;&gt; And the messenger said, "The fruit
[2:20:27] ripens at the top of the tree, at the
[2:20:31] very top of the tree, at the very end
[2:20:34] time." And that's where we are. Oh my
[2:20:37] brother, my sister, I declare with
[2:20:40] everything that's in me, I believe that
[2:20:42] the sun of righteousness is shining upon
[2:20:47] our soul, upon this body of Jesus
[2:20:50] Christ, this bride body. And we are
[2:20:55] I'm coming against every force of the
[2:20:57] enemy that would try to put a doubt in
[2:20:58] your mind or or cause you to believe a
[2:21:01] lie or cause you to be wearied with your
[2:21:03] walk with God. I want you to set it
[2:21:06] aside.
[2:21:07] &gt;&gt; I don't have to live where I lived
[2:21:09] before.
[2:21:10] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:21:11] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:21:14] &gt;&gt; Believe it.
[2:21:15] &gt;&gt; I'm challenging you in the name of Jesus
[2:21:17] Christ. Believe it. I don't have to go
[2:21:19] out of here the way I came in. Amen. I
[2:21:22] want an increase of the life of the son
[2:21:25] of man, Jesus Christ, the second Adam.
[2:21:30] &gt;&gt; Glory.
[2:21:31] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:21:33] &gt;&gt; Amen.

[2:21:42] That's where the dawn

[2:21:47] [Music]
[2:21:49] on which the prince
[2:21:52] of glory

[2:22:05] and for contempt.

[2:22:14] for it long
[2:22:17] that I should boast
[2:22:22] save
[2:22:24] the
[2:22:26] Christ
[2:22:28] my God
[2:22:31] all the way
[2:22:34] that coming.
[2:22:39] I sacrifice
[2:22:42] them to his blood.
[2:22:48] See from his head, his hands, his feet.
[2:22:57] Sorrow and

[2:23:21] Here's the words where the whole realm

[2:25:29] Make me more

[2:25:36] Jesus
[2:25:37] [Music]
[2:25:39] made
[2:25:40] me

[2:25:48] Give me
[2:25:53] that fil
[2:25:55] with love
[2:25:57] and make
[2:25:59] me all
[2:26:02] I need.
[2:26:05] Once again,
[2:26:07] just make
[2:26:09] me
[2:26:11] like,
[2:26:14] &gt;&gt; Lord Jesus,
[2:26:18] &gt;&gt; me

[2:26:27] me

[2:26:37] me more
[2:26:39] like
[2:26:42] [Music]
[2:26:51] sincerely
[2:26:54] with deep sincer sincerity
[2:26:58] sacred moment that we've entered into. I
[2:27:01] want this to be a different time for us.
[2:27:05] May the Son of Man increase as never
[2:27:08] before
[2:27:10] in each of our lives.
[2:27:14] And when he'd given thanks, he broke it
[2:27:16] and said, "Take, eat. This is my body
[2:27:20] which is broken for you. This do in
[2:27:22] remembrance of me." We'll partake
[2:27:25] together.
[2:27:29] [Music]
[2:27:53] And after the same manner also he took
[2:27:56] the cup and when he had sucked, saying,
[2:27:59] "This cup is the new testament in my
[2:28:01] blood.
[2:28:03] This do ye as often as you drink it in
[2:28:06] remembrance of me. And when you receive
[2:28:09] it, I would like you to be mindful."
[2:28:13] Said, "This is the New Testament, the
[2:28:16] entire New Testament
[2:28:19] in his blood, which was shed and
[2:28:21] spilled, and the life of it now is
[2:28:23] here." When you hold that cup and you
[2:28:25] partake of it,
[2:28:28] You're testifying that life has entered
[2:28:30] into me.
[2:28:32] I wonder brother
[2:28:35] Don Alexander if you would just pray.
[2:28:37] Please ask a blessing upon the people
[2:28:40] and
[2:28:42] join with me if each of you will please
[2:28:45] let's join our hearts together. Lord let
[2:28:47] this be a special moment and this as we
[2:28:50] partake together.
[2:28:54] Blessed Savior, Lord, as we gather
[2:28:57] tonight, Lord, and have come together in
[2:29:01] in remembrance and in honor of your
[2:29:03] sacrifice for us, your redemption to us,
[2:29:06] Lord. And we just
[2:29:08] come now, Father, recognizing that your
[2:29:11] life among us was God's own life, the
[2:29:14] life that we longed for and could never
[2:29:17] attain to, Father. and that you have
[2:29:20] made it available to us, Lord, so so far
[2:29:23] beyond our
[2:29:26] ability sometimes to believe that you
[2:29:28] love us that much, but you do. And you
[2:29:30] have told us again and again. And
[2:29:31] Father, we just accept your love, Lord.
[2:29:34] We accept your mercy. We accept your
[2:29:36] redemption and your promises, Lord. and
[2:29:38] pray you'll strengthen us, Father, as
[2:29:40] you bring to a close your great
[2:29:43] salvation, Lord, wrapping up, Lord, the
[2:29:47] events that you have laid out in your
[2:29:49] word, knowing that we're so close to the
[2:29:51] last steps, Lord, that we just pray
[2:29:54] you'll bless everything that we've heard
[2:29:57] today, Lord, and bring it to life, bring
[2:29:59] it to fruition
[2:30:01] for your name's sake, for your glory and
[2:30:03] honor, Lord, we ask in Jesus Christ's
[2:30:05] name. Amen.
[2:30:06] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[2:30:09] [Music]
[2:30:10] When you receive the cup, you just
[2:30:13] partake of it as soon as you feel ready.
[2:30:17] God bless you.
[2:30:19] Hallelujah.
[2:30:22] [Music]
[2:30:36] What we're doing now is remembering
[2:30:38] Calvary.
[2:30:41] We can sing that as we
[2:30:45] receive the cup.
[2:30:48] [Music]
[2:30:50] I remember Calvary 2201.
[2:30:59] Where he may lead me, I will go.
[2:31:03] Where he may lead me,
[2:31:07] I will go.
[2:31:11] For I remember
[2:31:14] to
[2:31:15] trust him so
[2:31:19] and I remember
[2:31:23] for me
[2:31:26] that he was slain on Calary.
[2:31:34] Jesus shall lead me
[2:31:38] night.
[2:31:42] Jesus shall lead me
[2:31:46] all the way.
[2:31:50] He is the trueest
[2:31:54] friend to me
[2:31:57] since I remember
[2:31:59] [Music]
[2:32:02] Calary.
[2:32:03] [Music]
[2:32:05] Oh, I delight in
[2:32:09] his command.
[2:32:13] Love to be led by
[2:32:17] his hand.
[2:32:20] His divine will is sweet to me.
[2:32:28] Out of my blood stain
[2:32:32] calary. Isn't he wonderful? Oh, Jesus
[2:32:36] shall lead me
[2:32:39] night and day.
[2:32:43] Jesus shall lead me
[2:32:47] all the way.
[2:32:51] He is the trueest
[2:32:54] friend to me.
[2:32:58] For I remember
[2:33:02] Calary.
[2:33:06] Onward I go. No doubt nor fear.
[2:33:14] Happy with Christ. My Savior's near.
[2:33:19] [Music]
[2:33:21] &gt;&gt; Trusting that I
[2:33:24] [Music]
[2:33:25] shall see. Yes, we will. Jesus, my
[2:33:29] friend,
[2:33:31] [Music]
[2:33:33] &gt;&gt; blessed friend. Oh, Jesus shall lead me
[2:33:39] night and day.
[2:33:43] Jesus shall lead me
[2:33:47] all the way.

[2:45:01] Mark, neighbor. We were there. We were
[2:45:03] helpless
[2:45:05] &gt;&gt; and we couldn't do anything. And we
[2:45:07] tried. We tried to reform. We tried to
[2:45:10] quit. We tried to be delivered. We made
[2:45:13] good attempts. We turned over a new
[2:45:15] leaf.
[2:45:16] &gt;&gt; But it didn't work. But one day, the
[2:45:18] master came.
[2:45:20] [Applause]
[2:45:22] Turn him loose.
[2:45:25] Chains be broken.
[2:45:28] [Laughter]
[2:45:30] &gt;&gt; And they fell. Glory. They dropped off
[2:45:34] of these hands. Oh, praise God. The

[2:45:56] &gt;&gt; Mary went to the tomb, but just the
[2:45:58] course part.
[2:46:00] We're going to go to foot washing right
[2:46:02] away. And those of you from Seattle, I'm
[2:46:04] just praying that God will keep you
[2:46:05] awake.
[2:46:06] &gt;&gt; Give you strength and energy. Amen.
[2:46:09] &gt;&gt; For tomorrow, we don't have these often
[2:46:11] enough cuz we have so many people. It's
[2:46:13] hard to do it all, but we're going to
[2:46:15] have foot washing. And if you never
[2:46:17] washed feet before, it's a wonderful
[2:46:19] experience because we're going to read
[2:46:21] the scripture.
[2:46:22] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:46:24] &gt;&gt; And we're just going to sing this course
[2:46:25] and I'm going to read the scripture and

[2:47:31] We're going to sing it just one more
[2:47:33] time. And when we say hallelujah, I want
[2:47:36] to imagine I want you to consider
[2:47:38] yourself on the other side.
[2:47:40] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:47:40] &gt;&gt; Looking back and realizing it's all
[2:47:42] over.
[2:47:43] &gt;&gt; And what kind of a hallelujah are you
[2:47:45] going to say?
[2:47:47] You might say, "Well, I'll really say it
[2:47:49] then. You that are born again, you're as
[2:47:52] good as there." You might as well say it
[2:47:54] right now. Oh, hallelujah. God,
[2:47:59] the stor
[2:48:01] [Applause]
[2:48:04] is empty
[2:48:08] at the father's right hand.

[2:48:47] Oh, hear us Lord.
[2:48:51] [Music]
[2:48:58] &gt;&gt; What a lovely Savior we have.
[2:49:02] &gt;&gt; And a supper being ended.
[2:49:06] Those of you that have not participated
[2:49:07] in footwashing before,
[2:49:11] if you have not,
[2:49:13] it's a wonderful experience and you may
[2:49:17] you may just observe if you need to, but
[2:49:20] I would participate if I were you if you
[2:49:22] want to get the full blessing of it
[2:49:24] because this what the Lord Jesus did and
[2:49:26] said. And the supper being ended and the
[2:49:28] devil having now put in the heart of
[2:49:30] Judas's Scariot, Simon's son, to betray
[2:49:32] him. And Jesus knowing that the father
[2:49:34] had given all things into his hands.
[2:49:37] This is John the 13th chapter verse
[2:49:39] three.
[2:49:41] And that he was come from God and went
[2:49:43] to God. He riseth from supper and laid
[2:49:46] aside his garments and took a towel and
[2:49:49] girded himself. After that he poured
[2:49:52] water into a basin and began to wash the
[2:49:55] disciples feet and to wipe them with a
[2:49:57] towel wherewith he was girded. This is a
[2:50:00] very determined act that our Lord has
[2:50:03] done. Laid aside, he riseth from supper.
[2:50:06] One laid aside his garments. Two, he
[2:50:09] took a towel. Three, he girded himself.
[2:50:12] Four, he poured water into a basin.
[2:50:14] Five, he washed the disciples feet. Six,
[2:50:17] and he wiped them. Seven.
[2:50:20] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:50:21] &gt;&gt; This was no accident.
[2:50:24] &gt;&gt; He was setting out a great example. And
[2:50:26] he said, he said it was an example. And
[2:50:28] he said, "Then cometh to Simon Peter."
[2:50:30] And Peter sa said unto him, "Lord, dust
[2:50:32] thou wash my feet?" Jesus answered and
[2:50:35] said unto him, "What I do, thou what I
[2:50:37] do, thou knowest not now, but thou shalt
[2:50:40] know hereafter?" Peter saith unto him,
[2:50:42] "Thou shalt never wash my feet." Jesus
[2:50:45] answered him, "If I wash thee not, thou
[2:50:47] hast no part with me." And Simon Peter
[2:50:50] said unto him, Lord, not my feet only,
[2:50:52] but also my hands and my head. Jesus
[2:50:55] said to him, "He that is washed needeth
[2:50:58] not safe to wash his feet, but is clean
[2:51:00] every wit. And ye are clean, but not
[2:51:02] all. For he knew who should betray him.
[2:51:05] Therefore said, he are not all clean."
[2:51:07] So after he had washed their feet, and
[2:51:10] had taken their garments, he and was set
[2:51:12] down again, he said unto them, "Know ye
[2:51:16] what I've done unto you? You call me
[2:51:18] Master and Lord?" And you say, "Well,
[2:51:22] for so I am. If I then, your Lord and
[2:51:25] Master, have washed your feet, ye also
[2:51:28] ought to wash one another's feet, not
[2:51:32] for the dirt of the path in Palestine,
[2:51:35] &gt;&gt; right?
[2:51:36] &gt;&gt; That isn't what he was doing. This was
[2:51:38] after supper.
[2:51:40] &gt;&gt; They were already refreshed, but this
[2:51:43] was after supper. And he said, "What I
[2:51:45] have done, you do to one another."
[2:51:49] &gt;&gt; That can't get any clearer. Amen.
[2:51:51] &gt;&gt; And you washed one another's feet. For I
[2:51:54] have given you an example, that you
[2:51:56] should do as I have done to you. Verily,
[2:51:58] verily, I say unto you, the servant is
[2:52:01] not greater than his Lord, neither he
[2:52:03] that is sent greater than he that sent
[2:52:06] him. If you know these things, happy are
[2:52:09] ye if you do them. And we say Lord Jesus
[2:52:12] and we are doing them
[2:52:15] &gt;&gt; and we will do it tonight
[2:52:19] &gt;&gt; in prayer.
[2:52:21] Gracious father who sent forth our Lord
[2:52:25] Jesus Christ who has left us such a
[2:52:28] clear and glowing and wonderful example.
[2:52:32] Bless your people Lord. The service has
[2:52:34] lingered but it's never too long. We're
[2:52:37] going to wait on one another. wash one
[2:52:39] another's feet. Bless the sisters, Lord,
[2:52:42] as they go and the brethren to the
[2:52:45] fellowship room. And I pray, oh God,
[2:52:48] that as we return to the sanctuary for a
[2:52:50] closing moment of prayer, I pray that
[2:52:53] you will grace every room, every place
[2:52:57] where the people are. Grace it with a
[2:53:00] holy presence
[2:53:02] as though Lord you were present here and
[2:53:06] you are watching and observing what we
[2:53:09] are participating in now we thank you
[2:53:12] that we have this opportunity. It is a
[2:53:14] privilege Jesus in your name. Amen.
[2:53:18] Amen. As the brethren will make their
[2:53:20] way please. And then soon as you're done
[2:53:23] don't visit if you would just come back
[2:53:24] because we're going to close. the
[2:53:26] sisters. I wonder if you know you
[2:53:28] sisters that have been around, you
[2:53:30] senior sisters and all, if you would
[2:53:33] please just make sure that everyone is
[2:53:35] taken care of. Thank you. God bless you.

[3:08:22] I I said, "You need to be baptized in
[3:08:24] the name of Jesus Christ."
[3:08:26] &gt;&gt; Amen. Baptism is a burial.
[3:08:30] &gt;&gt; And you don't sprinkle just dirt on
[3:08:32] anybody being buried. You put him under,
[3:08:35] &gt;&gt; cover him up.
[3:08:37] &gt;&gt; And leave the old man down there.
[3:08:39] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. We got a mass grave right
[3:08:42] here.
[3:08:45] We've buried lots of them. We'll bury
[3:08:47] brother Robert next Sunday night.

[3:09:08] with a heart disease. She'd been rushed
[3:09:11] to the hospital by ambulance how many
