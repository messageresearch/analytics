I'm going to ask brother [Music] We got some requests here this morning we want to take before the throne of grace. Amen. I'm uh I know brother John Andy's is here. I know if I saw him or not, brother John, if you'd come and take the request this morning. Um there's a request from Sister Janice Clark from North Carolina called to request prayer for her husband, Brother Eugene, who was diagnosed with Parkinson's disease three years ago. He's very weak and uh is requesting prayer for strength and healing. We got testimony from our sister Grace Bey wants to thank the Lord for healing. Amen. We're thankful for that. How many can testify to the healing grace of our Lord? Amen. So, we want to remember this request. If you got a need this morning and you're here looking to the Lord, you just take it before the Lord. If you're listening in on the internet this morning, the Lord's able to touch you as well. Brother John. Jesus. Hallelujah. Jesus God. Hallelujah. El Shi, we come to you, God. We come to you. We lift up our hands, God, as mortals, but knowing in our souls there's a sanctuary. Yes. &gt;&gt; You laid these songs on Brother Rod's heart, Lord. But when we sing them, Lord, it is so true. &gt;&gt; You're our only place of refuge. &gt;&gt; In the natural, we're standing here, but in the spiritual, we are running. &gt;&gt; We are on our faces, Lord. Our feet are around our hands are around your feet, Lord. There's nothing in our heart of guile. &gt;&gt; There's nothing in our hands we bring. &gt;&gt; There's no pride. There's nothing against any person. &gt;&gt; And if there is, would you take it away, God? If there's unbelief, if there's sin, if there's things that would keep us from your presence from you, would you even now with just a brush of your hand, deliver us, God, set us free. Lord, your prophet said in every gathering, there's three type of believers. But Lord, we are believers. God, we're confessing. Our heart is reaching up through the blood. that our voices, our thoughts are coming up through the blood. Oh Jesus, would you come this morning? We're reminded in the scripture, Lord, when things were going sideways as it was and you were being challenged and you consumed those the hearts were not right, but then you anointed your ministry to run through the congregation. Lord, would you run through this congregation today? Lives that might be broken or being swallowed up or sickness or sin or Satan's grip. Would you anoint your word to run through the congregation? Let there be healing. Let there be deliverance. Let there be chains broken. Let there be hearts set free. souls that are &gt;&gt; away from you. Let there be an awareness. Let there be a dermatitizing, a new birth. God, you're gathering your seed to yourself. So would you go through this meeting today, through this assembly, Lord, through this gathering of eagles, Lord, as we cry out your name, Adonai, God of grace, our Lord Jesus Christ, the only real God, the only one that satisfies our hungry, thirsty soul. And we do hunger for more realities. God, there's times we need to close the Bible, close a message book, and say, "Jesus, we want to see you in our day, in this atmosphere, in these hearts, in these lives. Not a God of history on paper or on tablets of stone or history, but a God of June 2009 that you would come through this congregation, God, and make yourself so real that lives could be healed, lives could be delivered, lives could be mended, that you would do the supernatural in this service. Lord, I lift my hand and witness that you are the same yesterday, today, and forever. and the generation that you thought in your mind and in your heart to manifest the change of the bodies that we are here God that we are responding to your spirit God and would you go out today and do what's in your heart to do may we respond appropriately God may every unbelief and every fear every question and every influence from that demonic realm that its powers would be crushed that he would be demoralized, that he would be defeated, that the sword of the word would go to the heart of the matter and that your people would be set free in the name of Jesus Christ. Lord that as you speak our name and our address and your word that is precious and we will be impressed Lord with your word that you God would be so manifested in our souls in our spirits and our bodies that your glory would fill this earth today. May this be an unusual meeting this morning God as we are reverencing Lord what you've done through the ages and believing it's coming to a harvest. May we wave under that presence, God. And may we, Lord, be benefic beneficiaries of that resurrection word, Lord, as you're coming to take mature people in a rapture. Let us be a mature people, Lord. Just have your way in these spoken requests. Our brother Rod read an unspoken request, Lord. Those that are needy, those that aren't with us, those that are here but are cradling in their heart desires. May you come and meet with us today Lord in Jesus name. Amen. Amen. You can have your seats. We have the school choir going to sing for us this morning. And uh we've got a lot of announcements. And maybe while I'm going through the the announcements, the the uh children can come and take their place on the platform. Um we have uh want to remind everyone next Sunday night is the Lord's table and footwashing. Um to note here, at long last, the Y brothers concert DVDs are available at the Bible way Christian Academy office. Call this week before school is out to place your order. Also, um I know and I I'm sure he doesn't mind me saying this, Brother Aaron Buckles finished a CD. I had a chance to listen listen to it. Uh, and it's uh it's really nice and I appreciate the work that brother uh Aaron put into it. Amen. So, if you're looking for the DVDs or u and the music, talk to brother uh brother Aaron or the DVDs, talk to the the school office. Um, we have an engagement announcement. It is with great pleasure that Mr. and Mrs. David Drake and Mr. and Mrs. Brian Beaver of Spencer, Indiana, announced the engagement of Amanda Drake and Joshua Beaver. Guess they're planning to get married in the fall and details will follow. So, we're happy for Sister Amanda, Brother Joshua. um men's choir practice this afternoon at 300 p.m. in the sanctuary here.

And uh we want to extend a special welcome this morning to brother Richard and Simeon Oliver who are visiting from uh Elum or Elam New Zealand. I'm probably pronouncing that wrong but want you to stand up. We're happy to have you here. God bless you. [Music] John saw a golden city, New Jerusalem come down. 12 chance for walls and gates of pearl. Such splendor all around and tears about a river of life. Close beneath the throne. I will drink and live eternally in a mansion all our make you want to go brother. That don't make you want to go, sister. That don't make you want to go to heaven. I don't know what does [Music] They say there is no heartache there and no more curse of sin. No sickness and no cross to bear. No death can enter it. No fighting and no battlefields. No war, no enemies. Where the lamb and mine lay side by side. That land of perfect peace. Oh, and that don't make you want to go, brother. That don't make you want to go, sister. That don't make you want to go. I don't know what does. [Music] No worries, no more to fear. Our faith will be made sight. It's a glorious land of endless day where Jesus is the light. &gt;&gt; Got a lot of friends and loved ones there. The savior I will meet my crown of old town at Jesus feet. Oh, that don't make you want to go, brother. That don't make you want to go, sister. That don't make you want to go. I don't know. I know. [Music] Make you want to go That don't make you want to go sister. I don't know. I don't know. Why? [Music] [Applause] Now, there's a note about a presentation. Who's doing the presentation? I think they want Brother Ken Buckles up here. You're doing the presentation. Brother Ken, you here? Brother Ken, on behalf of Bible Christian Academy, I'd like to present to Cloverdale Bible a check for $773. This is to go towards the purchase of a message hub for the church in Hanoria, Mexico. &gt;&gt; I'm I'm very privileged this morning to to receive this uh presentation uh behalf of uh Bible believers message hub. And just a little background, uh the school uh chose this as their project for this year back in September. They um wanted to uh sponsor a uh a print station and they chose to sponsor this print station in to go to uh Mterrey Cal or Mterrey, Mexico. And uh they work very hard throughout the uh the whole year to to uh accumulate the uh the funding and uh I they even in their physical ed uh portion of the schooling uh you may have seen that um a map on the wall that we're walking to Mterrey. Well, this is part of I think putting you know footprints our possession, you know. So, and I think this was a constant reminder and and you may have monitored their progress and and via the route that they chose, it was something like 4,700 km. And they achieved that goal physically by walking to Mterrey, but they also by selling uh popcorn, having special clothing days, uh you know, pay a dollar to wear a hat to school. I mean, we weren't allowed to wear hats to school, but uh you know uh or or jeans, which again, I mean, we never wore jeans to school, but you know, pay a dollar, wear jeans to school. And and this is how they raised the money. And then in addition to that, they just they just made offerings and the fulfillment of it is they have sponsored a print station in Mterrey, Mexico. And I think that's just a, you know, they they a lot of dedication, a lot of hard work, perseverance, and I think they deserve a great round of applause for what they're doing [Applause] now. Now, what they haven't seen and what you haven't seen as well is the the fulfillment of this uh project being a reality in Monterey. Brother Jake Dick was uh privileged to take that uh print station down to Monterey and set it up. And he has just a couple of slides that have never been seen seen here before. And he'll just show those now. and uh perhaps make a comment or two about what your efforts have done in Mterrey. Brother Jake, please. God bless you all. I think uh if we can turn the slides on. Mterrey, I think I gave a report here a couple months ago, but uh here's the print station set up in Mterrey. Let me just see if I can figure this thing out. There's uh what they did. First of all, they dedicated the Prince Station to the Lord. There's uh by the way, the brother down here on the left or on the right, he's the pastor. That's brother Estraa. There's another picture. And you can see in the background the box with the printer unpacking the printer. There's uh from left to right, brother uh the son-in-law to brother Estraa. Next is brother. He's the pastor down there. Another brother from uh way down south, San Louise Pisi. He's very interested in the Prince Station. Myself and another brother. It's a doctor unpacking the print station. Uh there it is in the printing the first books. First one in hand. They're very excited about this. And then uh brother Estraa he he printed out about 20 copies of the uh certain message that he hadn't had before and passed it out to all the different families in the church. That was the first thing he wanted to do. There it is. &gt;&gt; That's what it is. It's been a real blessing, tremendous blessing to the people. And I just one quick report the last uh two weeks ago I believe it was they took printed about uh 30 messages out put about six packages together of books and took a 5,000mi trip to the east coast and passed them out to the different brothers. So you know that's just a little part of what's happening. God bless you. &gt;&gt; Amen. So you you wonder what individual effort collectively can do. Uh in you know additionally has it made a difference? Absolutely. From before this print station the print station that our younger brothers and sisters paid for from before that print station was in Mterrey. the number of of um website hits and activities increased three over 300%. From before to now. So has it made a difference? Absolutely. And it's your efforts that may have put the message of the hour into the hands of someone that's going to be saved and it's going to be a crown or or a jewel in in your crowns. So all I can say is Lord bless these young brothers and sisters and and they should be an inspiration to all of us. &gt;&gt; Thank you so much. &gt;&gt; As they go down, we'll turn to the word. Brother Biscll, come. Why don't you lead me to the rock? Number 3:15. We can sing it together. Why don't you lead me to that rock that is higher than I me? [Applause] Why don't you lead me to that rock that is higher? Oh, thou shelter for me. And don't you lead me [Music] higher. Lord, lead me, Lord. Lead me. Why don't you lead me to that rock that is higher than high? Now I feel shelter for me. I don't you me that is higher lead me why don't you lead me to that rock that is higher than I shelter for me [Music] I I was getting so inspired there in the study seeing what the young people the school has done and just imagine what it was in eternity. &gt;&gt; I'm sure there's some rejoicing taking place. I really believe that. Uh and I have a a few quick slides also. I wish we had all day. Maybe we do. haven't got anything better to do &gt;&gt; and happy to see everyone here and God bless you. Uh tonight, Brother Murphy's going to be speaking and uh you want to be sure and get here early. Have a time of prayer and get refreshed this afternoon. Uh he's uh just returned back and was, I'm sure, quite weary and tired. Uh just a steady series of meetings and uh we're happy. I I heard some reports back and so that's I thought it's nice to have it while everything's fresh and then you heard the announcement I'm sure already next Sunday communion and footwashing next Sunday evening and uh now we just have a few slides of the Moscow church people here have been giving people out on the internet have been giving and I would like you to see uh the hard work that the people are doing there. So, uh these are uh the roof trusses that are going on now and we're just going to go through them quickly. Uh it was really really marvelous because the brothers in Ria and brother Dennis Dennis from Ria is coming to help them to actually put the roof on and uh I can see the hand of God because this whole second floor is because of Dennis's father and Ria who is a who's a builder and a contractor and he told them just with six more loads of concrete block you get a whole second floor to this building and that's exactly what they've Uh and and there you see it's very very becoming a very uh you know very respectable building. Uh just quickly there you see the roof tile starting to go on. And that was a that's a an amazing story within itself. They had costs for a roof on this building that were in the many many thousands of dollars and they found a a source for these tile and the tile are actually better than the other other product they were going to put on as brother Garrett Rodald and brother Sergey the pastor uh and uh the other tiles that were going to go on or the other roofing material that was going to go on was much inferior to this and they got this for about a quarter of the cost. So I think that's just absolutely wonderful and the brothers are working very hard. I think you recognize uh our brother Anatoli right here in front and that would be about half of the half of the group that's meeting there uh because the other side and this is in not in that building because that building's not finished. This is the place that they are meeting now. And uh brother brother Sergey here to the left, not right on the left but uh the three brothers on the left. The third one is brother Sergey and then then his brother Dennis uh to his right. And he's a wonderful interpreter also in the rush. And there's the tile. So my brothers hoisting it around. They're smiling. So, I'm just clicking through these very, very quickly because we don't want to take any more time than we need to. And that's that brings you up to date where we're at. And so, we're happy about that. Uh you have given and and the Lord has uh put it in the in their hearts. Uh you know, they're going to have a place to meet. And I would say like one brother here in the church said, "We we've got to see them in the building before the snow flies, I'll ask you to pray about some other things." Uh when I was with brother Sergey just a few days ago in Germany, he said uh to connect the water is going to cost like maybe 10 112,000 just to connect the water to get a connection. they have to get the connection from another man who paid $30,000 to have a uh have a connection. And so he he got this connection in anticipation that two or three others including the church would uh assist him and then they'll just break up that 30,000 between them. But he said even if I say today that we want to connect he said it could take four to 5 months to get the connection because things are just so ponderous and so bureaucratic and so slow. It's just really amazing. And he said it could take four to five months. So I'd like you to pray that it won't take four to five months. Do you believe it? &gt;&gt; One of our sisters went in to get a passport and uh you know what that can be and it just happens that there was a sister working in the passport and I think they're both here this morning and when the sister working there said oh just give me your form. got the form. Bang, bang, bang. Here's your passport. I said, 'Why don't they do that with everybody? You know, they can do it with one person, they can do it with everybody, you know, but you know, we've got the system and we got to stay in the system and so we stay harnessed to the system and and as far as I'm concerned, it's a it's just a ponderous thing. And that's what they're that's what they're concerned with there. They've got to go through a whole process of getting the water, getting the gas, getting the electricity, those three things. And if you would pray, it's also very costly. Uh but I I just believe that they shall be in this building and worshiping God and using it. Let it be a lighthouse. There isn't any in this area. There isn't anything in this area. It isn't as though they've got all kinds of churches in the area they don't have. And so we're very, very happy. in the people. Incidentally, it has done just wonders for them as there was three congregations that came together and it's just done wonders for them and brought them unified them and brought them together and focused them on on one purpose. So, we're thankful for that. All right. Uh I wonder if you could uh stand with me and we're going to turn to the scripture. I wonder perhaps uh if we could just sing there is none like you, no one else. &gt;&gt; Brother Rod, if you help me. &gt;&gt; There is none like you. &gt;&gt; No one else can touch my heart like you do. I could search for all eternity, Lord, and find there is none like you. &gt;&gt; There is none like there is none like you, Lord. No one else can touch my heart like you do. &gt;&gt; I can search for all eternity and find there is like you. Let's bow our heads together. Oh loving father in heaven, we have come this morning, Lord, that we might worship you. And I trust that our worship has been acceptable as we've entered into your courts with praise and thanksgiving. We thank you for the school children, Lord, for the teachers that have that have spent their time teaching and go the extra mile. for our brother Randy Timberman's Lord, the principal. We thank you for him and the efforts, oh God, of each family and the parents and everyone in the in the assembly, oh God. And we thank you, Father, for your guidance and your leadership and above all for your protection. You've kept us, oh God. And we say, keep us from the temptation and keep us from the evil, oh Lord. preserve your people, oh father. And uh we ask also that the Holy Spirit will just cause the flame in every heart for you have said you shall be witnesses unto me. And we want to be faithful witnesses, Lord. We want to declare this truth. We want to be good examples of it. And that's why we're here this morning. Teach us, Lord. And I pray you'll take me and let me be in the hollow of your hand. Let me be protected, oh God, that I may speak only what you would have spoken. Let the sheep be fed, Father, for this is your flock, the flock of God that led Israel out of bondage. You've led us out of bondage. You've led us out of darkness and confusion. And we're here to lift our voices and give you praise and thanksgiving in the name of Jesus Christ. Anoint the people as they hear and may we father with one spirit say speak Lord and I will answer in Jesus name. Amen. Amen. God bless you. If you wish to take your Bibles and follow through the three places I want to read the same text we read last Sunday because I'm carrying on from last Sunday. 2 Corinthians the 4th chapter we'll read verse 17 and 18 and then I'll be reading Hebrews 11 and13 and Philippians 3 and14 2 Corinthians 4:17 for our light affliction which is but for a moment workketh for us a far more exceeding and eternal weight of glory. I think that that verse, that scripture is so powerful. I trust we can grasp its depth. Our light affliction, anybody who's going through affliction, it's it's hard to call it light affliction, but I believe that Apostle Paul is speaking relatively in comparison with what the affliction is doing. and achieving in our lives that it's a light affliction, but and it's and because it's just for a moment, it workketh for us a far more exceeding and eternal weight of glory, while we look not at the things which are seen, but at the things which are not seen. For the things which are seen are temporal, they're transient, they're passing, they're short-lived. But the things which are not seen are eternal. &gt;&gt; Then in Hebrews it speaks of the heroes of faith. And the 13th verse reads these all died in faith. And this was just after speaking of Abraham, Sarah and uh and and the seed that was to follow. These all died in faith, not having received the promises, but having seen them aar off. What was it? They saw the promises and were persuaded of them. I love that they were persuaded number one of them. And number two, they embraced them and number three and confessed that they were strangers and pilgrims on the earth. Apostle Paul says in Philippians 3:14, "I press toward the mark for the prize of the high calling of God in Christ Jesus." And I think we could all join Apostle Paul in his writing and in his confession and say, "Amen." &gt;&gt; We join with you in this. &gt;&gt; Amen. Uh you may be seated. And I'll ask for your full attention. Not that you don't normally do so, but try not to be distracted by any movement. And let's not have any more movement than absolutely necessary because I have a ways to go and I want to go as quickly and as and and so have have the service as intense as possible. The Bible is a record of the supernatural. Is a record of those people who looked and did see the unseen. Their lives were directed. Their decisions were made not because of the circumstances that was surrounding them but because of what they saw. I think of the I think of the goals that people set for themselves. and the young people that have just graduated and and young families that are just beginning more or less they have by natural standards they have a future ahead of them and we all are at different uh different locations on the uh you know the ladder of time. Uh we have uh uh we we have perhaps some people are more uh have more foresight. Uh others perhaps are not so concerned about the future. But all of us have some goals. And uh uh there's nothing wrong with having goals. But we need to have a goal. We need to have our ultimate goal. And then you know you have goals along the way. We are we are told and and it's a common thing in in business practice or practice of uh uh in natural affairs that we set goals that are achievable. Don't try to have a goal that you can't make. You you set and you set a number of goals and you have you know you have targets along the way and say okay all right now we've achieved that and then we move to the next one and hopefully move to the next one. But with us in in life, we're not going to get away from having uh need to deal with uh this natural life. &gt;&gt; We we we're going to have to deal with it. Young people are going to have to deal with their education. They're going to have to deal with their uh make decisions about what they're going to do and their profession and and what they're going to do for uh the kind of work and the kind of income. And young couples are getting married and we're having a number of marriages this year. And there's planning and there's decisions that have to be made and where are we going to live and where are we going to work and all of these things. And I want to contend today that we can make those decisions without being uh overcome by them. We can make those decisions by uh and yet keep an ultimate goal in view. We can make those decisions by having and yet keep the ultimate prize as the prize and that as our all-consuming desire. This is our desire. This is our ambition. This is our goal. This is our purpose. And all of these things are just peripheral things. These are just things that we have to go through in achieving that one. We're here. We have certain responsibilities. And I would like to say also very very quickly that the things that God's word calls on us to do is not something that is of in the natural world. Now, uh, I'd like to say this as quickly as I can, but you I've had I've counseledled with so many many people and they've given their life to Christ and then they say, "I'm just so all these natural things that just I I just, you know, all these things of the world, all these natural things." They think their job is natural and and women caring for their families is natural. That's not natural. That's spiritual. &gt;&gt; The It's the word of God that calls on a man to provide for his family. It's not just some idea of the government. It's the word of God. The word of God tells us to and and the prophet brings it out that you know, if you're called to be a housewife, be the best housewife there is. Called to be a farmer, be the best farmer you there is. Where I think we should be the best and believers should be the best in the in the even in the what they call the natural. And that is why a believer can keep the unseen before them. Uh so I just as I said a moment ago that the Bible is a a record of those that looked through the eyes of faith and uh here's just a few that I selected. Brother Brandham says uh uh regarding the prophet Joel. He said looking down through eyes of faith he saw this vine coming up out of Genesis. He said of Job through the eyes of faith 4,000 years ahead. And he said uh that he saw what the lamb meant. He saw what you mean. And and and he saw the promise. I know that my redeemer liveth and at the last days he'll stand on the earth. And those skinworms take me back like it did that flower yet in my flesh shall I see God. Paul, he looked through the eyes of faith and he looked across the seas of time and said that in the last days perilous times shall come. He looked through and he didn't only see good times. He saw perilous times by eyes of faith. And he said they would be high-minded and lovers of pleasure and more than lovers of God. Sooner go out on a Sunday afternoon, he said, and play golf then come to church because it's too hot. He saw those kind of conditions. He saw people become that kind of lax and and pleasure mad. I'm glad we're able to say that's not our part. &gt;&gt; That's not what we're interested in. He he says to another sister that he's speaking to, sister by eyes of faith. Let's look there to Calvary. Are you stand on a platform and look to I and look with eyes of faith to Calvary. It's entirely possible. &gt;&gt; It's entirely possible to focus on Calvary. It's entirely possible with eyes of faith to reach through to a finished promise and bring it down into this realm and experience the realities of God. &gt;&gt; And as I spoke last week on hungering for the realities of God, that's what I'm hungering for. And I'm I'm speaking the second part two on that same subject. Without faith, it's impossible. Uh the works is without faith, works is dead. And he said, "By eyes of faith, we look there and see that there's where the debt was paid." Every person in this building needs to look with eyes of faith and see that your debt was paid &gt;&gt; and see it so well stamped paid that Satan cannot at any point in time lay any charge to you. &gt;&gt; The debt was paid. Jesus Christ the same yesterday. He said, "We're looking towards Calvary. By eyes of faith, we believe that he's here." &gt;&gt; Oh, no. We're not just seeing Calvary, but we're seeing that the one that was on Calvary has been raised from history, &gt;&gt; and he's here to do the same things that he always did &gt;&gt; in expectation. I want to just read a few more of these just to start with. He said, 'You know, I feel religious now. I really do. He said, I wasn't expecting this, but to think of God, he said, Abraham called those things which were not as though they were. He didn't look at the natural thing. Now, that's our father in the faith. He didn't look at the natural thing. He looked at the unseen. He looked by eyes of faith what God said. And what God said God would keep. He knew he could keep it. So he believed it and testified of the things that he didn't see as though they had already happened. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He said, "I hope you get it." &gt;&gt; I hope we get it, too. &gt;&gt; You know, I always look at things. Brother brother Brandham preached in Chicago on Wednesday in uh this back in 1955. He preached on the power of the devil. Then the very next night he came and he preached on the power of God. And I can tell you I just know in uh in the mind of God he just had him he had him putting it in that order. Let the people hear the power of the devil. And in that he says, "And when we see Satan in all of his corruption and making you young ladies and men and old and everything out here on the street drunk and cursing and swearing and acting the way that they're doing under Satan's domain." But he says, "But we can look beyond that. All the things that are so cumbersome, so dark, so vile, so perverted, so corrupt. And it is friends. You live in a very dark world. &gt;&gt; And you are very bright lights &gt;&gt; in a very dark place. &gt;&gt; You know that. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But we can look beyond that with eyes of faith and see a perfect world &gt;&gt; with a perfect people &gt;&gt; during a time of a millennium &gt;&gt; not up in the future. I'm saying to you on the basis of this word you can see that now. Apostle Paul says we are not to look at the natural things. For the things that are seen are temporal. These bodies are temporal. This building is passing. All that we see, all that you've accumulated, all that you are or known as, it's all passing. But there's another place. &gt;&gt; There's a perfect world where there is no sin, &gt;&gt; no devil, no temptation. It's a perfect world. perfect world &gt;&gt; and we're either headed there or we're headed for a very dark chaotic place. I don't want to I don't want any part of the tribulation. &gt;&gt; I don't want any part of being away from God. I can't even comprehend what it would be to be out of fellowship and out of the presence of God. I can't comprehend that. I can't even comprehend. I think about the congregation. I think about the offices of the church. I think about my own family. I think about my grandchildren, great grandchildren. I can't comprehend. I cannot accept &gt;&gt; as long as God has given me his word and said, "Believe. &gt;&gt; For all things are possible. I cannot comprehend that a man or a woman has to accept anything outside of the promises of God." &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And I believe that &gt;&gt; with all that's within me. I believe that sir. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; It may be and may look impossible. &gt;&gt; But that goes against the scripture. &gt;&gt; For the scripture says nothing shall be impossible. &gt;&gt; Nothing. &gt;&gt; Nothing. Amen. &gt;&gt; You agree with that? &gt;&gt; Nothing shall be impossible. Why don't you make that confession with me? Nothing shall be impossible. Hallelujah. To him that believe it. &gt;&gt; And that's why we're here this morning. &gt;&gt; We're here as a even our physical bodies sitting here in seats. We're saying something. We're making a declaration. We're not saying that, you know, well, here I am to have some some extend my social life or my friends or my influence. We're not here. I'm not here to gain any brownie points. I'm here to make a declaration. I was happy when I thought of coming to church this morning and being able to say something out of the word of God. Something that's worthwhile. This is the life. &gt;&gt; And this world is passing away. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen. &gt;&gt; I was thinking of the goals the goals that we have and we have you know points of reference and if you read in uh in the in the seals message and the opening of the seals brother Brandon speaks about the opening of the seal and then a a seal is opened and a and a thunder is a thunder roars and and then a a plague falls and brother Brandham says and he says this is the plan of it And after each seal is opened, it follows the same process. And then a plague falls. He sends his messenger. He sends his message. The seal is open. You hear the thunder and the voice of God. He sends his messenger for that age and declares the word for that age. And it's rejected. And then a plague falls. And he says a temporary judgment. &gt;&gt; There's a temporary judgment. And the world has gone through those temporary judgments. But God, he's not he's not satisfied with temporary judgments. There's coming an ultimate judgment. &gt;&gt; And in that ultimate judgment, he's going to finalize the redemption of the earth. &gt;&gt; I can tell you the perfect earth's not going to be raped of its mountains and its forests and so on and so forth. It's not going to be polluted and contaminated. They talk about pollution. Man is the greatest pollutant. It's man that's polluting the earth. &gt;&gt; The earth keeps trying to renew itself. &gt;&gt; Man is the pollutant. &gt;&gt; He's the one who's invented all of the plastics and the chemicals and all of these things and take all the oil out and bring more death all the time. Man, he's the main pollutant. And how God is going to clean up the earth, he's going to clean up man. &gt;&gt; We're not going to have any of that scientific stuff over there. We're going to have a science in a world that's so far beyond that this isn't even in the thinking of it. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So he said with eyes of faith we can see a perfect world and a perfect per people during a time of a millennium &gt;&gt; where there won't be any cursing and any swearing and drinking and any death and sorrow. It's all wiped away because of the redeemer &gt;&gt; redemption has taken place. And then in the very next night, the power of God, he said, when eyes of faith, what a power faith has. Oh, it goes so far beyond the devil's power. He just preached that the night before. I want you to I want you to you might as well have sat there and preach it one night and the next night because this word's eternal word and the it it goes there. It goes so far beyond the devil's power. The devil takes you to death, but faith looks beyond that. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; This a reality, friends. &gt;&gt; We've had our funerals. &gt;&gt; We've gone to our gravesides. We've lost our loved ones. We've lost precious people. But faith &gt;&gt; looks beyond that. Amen. &gt;&gt; This word of God declares we shall not all sleep. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; It's not just some mind over matter. It's a reality because today we are like our forefathers. We look beyond. We must look beyond. And that must be our focus. We must look beyond it. We see all this chaos down here. We hear all this rumble and all this noise. Oh, I even take my wife and I just taken out for a walk and bunch of young men like these young fellas here. How glad I am to see your clean faces and know your hearts are clean. And here just spewing out all kinds of vulgarity which should be against the law. &gt;&gt; It used to be against the law. I'll tell you what, if you raise up today and say very much, you might be stabbed for it right on the street. And I thought, "Oh, God, we're uh we're on our way to a place that'll never be heard again. &gt;&gt; That vile voice will never be heard again. That demon who's even inspiring it, he's going, &gt;&gt; I want a ringside seat &gt;&gt; when God destroys cancer. Amen. &gt;&gt; When the serpent, Satan himself, is cast into the lake of fire, I want a balcony seat. &gt;&gt; I want to be able to see it. And the the Bible says the redeemed are going to shout glory. &gt;&gt; They're going to say, "Hallelujah." &gt;&gt; You might as well start it right now. &gt;&gt; I read today where brother Brandham says, "If you don't like shouting, don't go to heaven. Don't plan to go there. Going to be a lot of noise over there. People are going to be shouting. They're going to be singing. They're going to be dancing on the streets of glory. &gt;&gt; And it can be a reality even now. &gt;&gt; You can see it now. And you need to see it. If you keep your eyes down here, you'll be heavy-hearted. You'll be cast down. And he'll use those things to drag you down. When you can say, "I'm looking beyond that. I look beyond death. I look beyond the tombstone. I look beyond the sickness and the disease. I look beyond the affliction which is just for a moment. I look to the realities of God. &gt;&gt; And there are they are a reality to me by faith. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Hallelujah. And the last one he said in the the message the darkest hour then Jesus comes along. And today he says when we go to the grave with our loved ones and hear the minister say ashes to ashes and dust to dust and earth to earth and hear the clouds dropping in upon the casket. But he says, "But we could look at that and by eyes of faith, we can look across the sea, yonder, and see the empty tomb." &gt;&gt; I don't know if you had that experience, but I I thought if I ever have to go to another graveside, I'm going to look across that casket. I'm going to look across and with eyes of faith, I'm going to look at an empty tomb. &gt;&gt; That is why our faith is different from every faith on earth. Muhammad is still in his grave. &gt;&gt; Buddha is in his grave. Probably a teaspoon of ashes. All these great leaders who've been holy men to their people are still in their grave. You and I have an empty tomb. And the one that came out of that tomb is here on the platform today. The one that is in that was in that tomb is here in this building today. He has raised from Calvary from He is raised from the from the tomb. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And he sent his messenger and proved that he's a son of man revealed again today. &gt;&gt; He's the same yesterday, today, and forever. &gt;&gt; And what he did back there, he'll still do today. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; He's not ashamed of his word. Amen. &gt;&gt; And so we look beyond these temporal things &gt;&gt; which are enduring only for a while, short-lived, only for a season, transient, and temporary. Lord, the psalmist David said, "Man is like a van is like to vanity. His days are as a shadow that passeth away." Paul said in Corinthians, "And they that use this world is not abusing it. For the fashion of this world, fashion of this world passeth away. The fashion, the design, not the fashion as the fashion industry so much, but the the order of this world, the arrangement of this world, this cosmos, it's passing away. That's why it keeps changing. Even in our short lifetime, it changes dramatically. And John said, "The world passeth away, and the lust thereof, the desires thereof, lust is strong desires, but he that doeth the will of God abideth forever." &gt;&gt; And as you believe it, you may say, "Amen." &gt;&gt; And I saw a new heaven. John said in Revelation 21, "And I saw a new heaven." He saw it. He was on Patmas, &gt;&gt; but he saw something else. &gt;&gt; He didn't see the vipers &gt;&gt; and that dry piece of rock that he was on and Patmas, but he saw a new heaven. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And a new earth. &gt;&gt; And he saw the first heaven and the first earth were passed away. &gt;&gt; And there was no more sea. He said in 21 and4 and God shall wipe away &gt;&gt; amen &gt;&gt; all tears from their eyes &gt;&gt; and there's nobody here I don't think a single person here but what has struck that moment in life where tears welled up in your eyes over some situation or over some desire or maybe over some joy that you had. I hope you had tears of joy. But even brother Brandham says that the marriage supper of the lamb will sit across from one another &gt;&gt; and we'll look at one another &gt;&gt; and we'll begin to weep for joy &gt;&gt; to know we've made it &gt;&gt; and it's all over. &gt;&gt; And you wouldn't want anybody, you wouldn't want your best friend to call you back. [Applause] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; We don't want our friends to come back. I don't want my parents to come back and go through what I'm going through or go through what you and I have to go through. We're so glad it's over. And we'll weep. We'll we'll have tears of joy, not sorrow. Joy will run down our face &gt;&gt; and we'll grip one another and embrace one another. &gt;&gt; That is our vision. That's what we see because that is a reality. you're going to go to a restaurant today or go to a home and and have your dinner, whatever more, that's not a reality cuz it's passing. &gt;&gt; The music you hear in the thumping on the in the cars and the automobiles is not a reality. &gt;&gt; Your pain, your sorrow, your affliction, your death that is experienced is not a reality. It's a passing vanity. &gt;&gt; And the Bible calls them lying vanities because it's not true. If it's not true, it can't be a reality. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. [Music] &gt;&gt; And he said, "We'll weep for joy &gt;&gt; and the king will come out and he will wipe those tears from your eyes." Just imagine. Don't cry anymore, children. &gt;&gt; It's all over. We don't want some of these goals to be beyond or think it's beyond reach. You must never think it's beyond reach. As we've pondered this and thought about this, I have encountered scripture and the approach of God's prophet to the scripture and the things and because we feel we are so far from attaining it must never lose sight of it. Must never lose sight of it. I said &gt;&gt; regardless of how impossible it may seem for you say I'll never attain to that. I'll just tell you that's not your problem. &gt;&gt; What is your what is your your your commission is to see it to believe it &gt;&gt; and to set your face towards it. &gt;&gt; That's that's your pro that's your task. That's your job. That's your challenge. Amen. &gt;&gt; It's God's responsibility to bring you there. &gt;&gt; So, we do not look at the things that are temporal, but we are looking at the things that are eternal, the things that are without beginning or end. I'm going to read the same quote from last Sunday once again, please. I think it's striking. The whole armor &gt;&gt; of Christianity, and you do need armor. &gt;&gt; The whole armor of Christianity is faith. Everything that we have is unseen. &gt;&gt; That's a staggering statement. Everything that we have that you actually possess is unseen. &gt;&gt; The only things that's real is unseen, unexplained. &gt;&gt; The things that can be explained are not real. &gt;&gt; They're superficial, &gt;&gt; right? and die. &gt;&gt; But the things that cannot be explained are immortal. &gt;&gt; The whole realm, the things that can't be explained. And that's what they say about realities. There are things that we are they're not even we're not even made to comprehend them. It goes beyond our comprehension. And I know it gets still in here and it gets quiet because you're pondering it, but those words are true. And that's why the Apostle Paul says we look not and that's a challenge. We look not at the things that are seen &gt;&gt; because they're temporal. &gt;&gt; I can't be consumed with the technical parts of of life. If you are consumed with that say, "Oh, you have a goal. You may have a goal in education. You may have a goal in your profession. You may have a goal in your business. Fine. Just keep moving on and let that goal only be a an intermediate. &gt;&gt; Uh let it be just something that you're going to achieve and go on from there. But what is driving you? And I'm going to be coming to this in just a few moments. We're being driven. Believers are driven people. There's a call on our life. And I'm going to approach that in just a few minutes. And that call is driving us to the realities of God. And that is why if you get into Hebrews in the faith chapter and I took the one of my text uh scriptures from that and the and Paul said in Hebrews 12, but looking unto Jesus the author and finisher of our faith who for the joy that was set before him endured the cross despising the shame and is set down. Do you think that Jesus looked to Calvary and the suffering as the goal? No. He looked beyond that. &gt;&gt; He looked to the joy &gt;&gt; of the achievement of Calvary. &gt;&gt; And the Bible says of of Abraham, Abraham says, "For he looked for a city which hath foundations whose builder is and maker is God." I'm going to just dwell on this and taking a slight shift for just a moment. says he looked for a city. And the Hebrew word is he he waited in expectation for the city. The prophet of God says he looked for the city because he had met the king of the city. He had met Melzdc who was in a theophony form who appeared in the priesthood as king and priest high priest of the most high God. He had met him and it and and and Melzdc came to Abraham who was his prophet and all those three offices converging at that moment prophet priest and king at one time on earth. Oh, I've said it many times, but it was the father coming to the father. And then brother Brandham says, you don't see, you don't hear any more of me become because he became Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; And Jesus Christ where the father came to the father in the form of Melzdc. Then Jesus Christ came to Abraham's sons. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; In the form of a son, &gt;&gt; the son of man, &gt;&gt; the son of God, and the son of David. So the father came to the father and the son came to the sons. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; That's why Abraham Abraham the father mechazedc came to Abraham and Abraham now looked for the city because he says this is a king of the city. &gt;&gt; You and I have met the son &gt;&gt; and now we must look &gt;&gt; because we've already met him. &gt;&gt; So we know there's a place. He told us there's a place. &gt;&gt; He told us that you believe in me, you'll never die. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. That's where we look. &gt;&gt; And we wait and we expect it. &gt;&gt; Oh, I want to say to this congregation, don't be consumed with all this that is passing. &gt;&gt; Don't be consumed with it. We've got to we we we've got to work our way through life, but this is not the this is not the important thing. &gt;&gt; He says Abraham in the future home. He was looking for it. And he professed that he was a pilgrim and a stranger. That's what Apostle Paul said in Hebrews. For he looked for a city whose builder and maker was God. That prophet knowing it was somewhere. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; John saw it coming down. But Abraham thought it must be on the earth right then. &gt;&gt; Why? He had met &gt;&gt; Melzdc. &gt;&gt; When he met Melzdc, he thought this city is already here. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And there was nothing wrong with that. &gt;&gt; The king of it. And gave him a tithe. Hallelujah. So we we we look to the we look to the resurrection. We look to the catching away. We look to the redeemed. We look to the wedding supper because we have because we have met him. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Because we've been wedded to him. &gt;&gt; I trust you have experienced that. &gt;&gt; We look not at the things which are temporal and passing. And it is this it is this uh something that takes place and I have a hard time defining it but I don't have difficulty experiencing it and I want to I want to just talk to you about it and that is the call the call of God because God Jesus Jesus said, "The world, they don't see me. They won't see me, but you will see me." God spoke about Abraham and that and the Bible says, "And they saw the promises a far off." Brother Brandon breaks that down. And I have the quote. I'll probably come to a little later. And he says he looked he looked to the unseen and he saw Isaac. &gt;&gt; He actually saw Isaac. He was looking to the unseen. He saw Isaac. Now that was the father of the faith. So Isaac and Isaac was a type of Christ. We are children of Abraham by faith. Is that correct? Amen. &gt;&gt; So now, and we have the same faith of Abraham. &gt;&gt; We don't see the Isaac that he saw, &gt;&gt; but we see the Isaac that that Isaac reflected. &gt;&gt; That Isaac spoke of Christ. &gt;&gt; You know what, friends? We need to have our vision cleared up. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; We need to see him &gt;&gt; as he is &gt;&gt; today. We need to see him not just to hear certain words. Not just to know that Luke 17:30 has been fulfilled. In the day when you see Sodom in the days of Noah returned, even thus shall it be when the son of man is revealed. &gt;&gt; And when we see him actually see him revealed, we see a person. &gt;&gt; We see the person that the word has defined. God has always defined himself. His most accurate definition of himself has been in word form. &gt;&gt; That's why he always came in word form. &gt;&gt; Apostle Paul saw a bright light. He might have got up and said, "Oh, what an experience. I saw a light that struck me to the ground, turned me blind." No, that wasn't it. He knew that was God. He knew that was the same presence. He knew that was the holy presence of almighty Jehovah God. Who art thou Lord? Amen. &gt;&gt; And he had to define himself in word form. Paul knew about Jesus. &gt;&gt; He he was even on his way to to do destructive things to the followers and disciples of Jesus. He knew who Jesus was, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; In a in a passing way, in a temporal way. Now he's struck down by a light. Who art thou, Lord? And a voice comes. He hears a voice and it says, I am Jesus. Yeah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It's hard for you to kick against the pricks. And in that one experience, God has defined himself. And then the light goes on inwardly. He's still blind. But now he knows that it's Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; So he looks beyond even those that he's going to persecute. God has defined himself. Now here, listen to what the scripture says. Abraham asks God, "How will I know? You know, you you've promised a seed. I'll have a seed. I'll have a seed." And the Bible says that they looked to the promises even though they were a far off. They looked to the promises. Abraham's faith. That's the kind of faith we have. That's the kind of quality of faith that's in the believer. We can look at a promise. If it happens tomorrow, fine. If it doesn't, it doesn't change anything. &gt;&gt; Am I right? &gt;&gt; The sooner we go, the sooner the catching away of the bride of Jesus Christ, the better. But if it doesn't happen, and sometimes people get very disheartened if I say maybe you got 50 years, oh, shows you're looking at the natural. &gt;&gt; Yes, it does. &gt;&gt; I'm not destroying your faith. It shows that you're looking at the temporal &gt;&gt; cuz you want to escape it. The scripture says we don't want to. We're not groaning to be unclothed. &gt;&gt; We're groaning to be clothed upon. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; We don't groan because of our circumstances. We don't groan because we're here in this world. God put you here. &gt;&gt; We're not groaning over our circumstances. God allowed you to be in your circumstances. &gt;&gt; And God wants you to be victorious over it. How can I be victorious, Brother Ed? You can be victorious by looking beyond the circumstances. I look over the head of the dust &gt;&gt; and the den and the noise. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; I have I've had a lot of experience and I'm going to relate a little bit today. I had a man that I counseledled with over a period of years. You know what his big problem was? He says, "I hate working for my I hate working to provide for my family." That was always his problem. I hate working to provide for my family. I just can't. Well, why do I have to work for them? Is you know where he is today? I don't know. He's certainly not here. Why would he be here? &gt;&gt; That's absolutely contrary to the word of God. &gt;&gt; You'll be quiet. You'll really think these things overach. &gt;&gt; If we look at these things, we will most certainly be distracted. &gt;&gt; And most certainly I I think that if a man has his has his priorities right and he sees what his purpose is on earth, he just love &gt;&gt; to fulfill the word of God. Amen. &gt;&gt; Whether his responsibilities are few or many, &gt;&gt; he'll he'll love to fulfill the word of God. &gt;&gt; Now, the Bible says this of Abraham because he said, "How will I know that I inherit this land?" I'll maybe just uh uh turn to it quickly. You can turn with me if you would. It's in um It's in Genesis 15 and and uh in the second verse says, "And Abraham said, Abram said, Lord God, what wilt thou give me seeing I go childless and the steward of my house is this Eleazar of Damascus?" And Abram said, Behold, to me, thou hast given no seed. And lo, one born in my house is mine heir. And behold, the word of the Lord came unto him, saying, This shall not be thine heir, but he that shall come forth out of thine own bowels shall be thine heir. And he brought them forth abroad and said, "Look now toward heaven and tell the stars if thou can if thou be able to number them." And he said unto him, "So shall thy seed be." And he believed in the Lord. And it was counted to him for righteousness. Amen. &gt;&gt; And that is where God then answered him and said, "Take a ram of 3 years old and take a heer 3 years old and a goat of three years old and uh a ram of three years old and turtle dove and a young pigeon." And this is where he divided the pieces and that's where God made a covenant with him. But he was asking, "How will I know?" And God showed him Calvary, which we have spoken on that, but we don't want to take the time for it right now. But then in in uh 21 Genesis 21 and 12 and God said to Abraham, "Let it not be grievous because what was grievous now is Ishmael had come on the scene." And there was contention and Sarah uh would not have Hagar and his s and and her son mocking Isaac at this time of the weaning. And God said unto Abraham, verse 12, "Let it not be grievous in thy sight, because of the lad, and because of thy bond woman, in all that Sarah hath said unto thee, hearken unto her voice. For in Isaac shall thy seed be called." Now, I'm just going to need your full attention for a for the next few moments. when God said to Abram and Abraham was saying how will I know that uh you haven't given me any seed and it was after this then he's given he has and Sarah had said take Hagar so he takes her counsel and has a child by Hagar and has a son so now he does have seed and it's Ishmamail all Right then now the same one who told him take Hagar now is saying I won't have her I won't have this bond woman and her son mocking my son now the one that came by her the the without getting into it but we find that Cain Cain was the wrong seed in the right womb. Abel was the right seed in the right womb. And he was righteous. Ishmael was the right seed in the wrong womb. Isaac was the right seed in the right womb. And so when Sarah now when she receives this her son which is the right seed in the right womb, she will not allow the wild one because ca Cain was wild. Ishmamail was wild and she will not tolerate him mocking this right one the type of Christ and so he can't be and so now Abraham is caught in the midst of this and God said then don't let it be grievous to you because of the lad and because of the bond woman in all that Sarah hath said. Now Sarah has a has something that she is uh putting forward and Apostle Paul refers directly to her words and brings it on into the New Testament. Hearken unto her for in Isaac shall thy seed be called. Now, Isaac was a son of promise. Ishmael, he took a bond woman who was capable of conceiving. Sarah was not capable of conceiving. So now this goes way beyond the natural ability. So he becomes a son of promise. And then Apostle Paul breaks it down and he says the children of God are not the children of the of of Isaac after the flesh. &gt;&gt; So even though God gave Isaac through a natural birth to a woman and a man who could not possibly have it without a supernatural act. But even then it was not the seed that should come from Isaac. say, "Oh, now we have Isaac and Isaac takes a wife and I'm Jacob and he takes a wife and on down now we have a holy lineage." No, not at all. Because because Apostle Paul says clearly, it's not the natural seed. All of Israel is not Israel. &gt;&gt; It's not the natural seed. the power that God is as the the the the the creative power, the the very power that would make you sinless, the very power that would give you eternal life or cause you to know that you have eternal life. That very power did not lay in a natural seed. It laid in a promise. &gt;&gt; And they saw the promises of God a far off. They actually saw reality. And Abraham saw Isaac, but he looked even beyond Isaac. &gt;&gt; And Apostle Paul now brings this and says it's it's not the natural seed. It's not the children that are of the flesh. That's they're not the seed. &gt;&gt; It's the children of the promise. &gt;&gt; So, so we didn't come by any natural lineage from Abraham. &gt;&gt; But we came as a product of a promise. We are actually children of &gt;&gt; I don't care what your name is &gt;&gt; or where you came from &gt;&gt; or what your background is or what your heritage is. I I have no interest in that and you should have very little interest in it. It's not your roots, &gt;&gt; natural roots that's important. &gt;&gt; It's the fact that God uttered a word and he gave a promise. &gt;&gt; He he he promised himself. Amen. &gt;&gt; He He said it in his word that he would have a people in this end time that would actually believe the promise. They have to believe the promise because they came out of the promise. &gt;&gt; I don't have to have anybody convince me who my father is and my mother. I came from them. I am of my father's natural seed and I came out of the womb of my mother and nobody has to give me uh you know some kind of studies you don't have to give me a book about it I just know that because I came from them and and I oh no other things I have traits that I saw in my father when I was a boy I saw certain traits that my father did and here I find out these many years later I'm doing exactly the same thing put my finger to my face exactly like my father did. Swallow just like my father did. Or stand sit at the table and and and and my wife says, "Well, you know, you you play with your knife and fork and things. That's just what your dad used to do." Well, so I don't need a that's not a revelation to me. He did it. I do it. So So So that's the thing. But on the other hand, now that's that's the temporal. He's in a grave someplace in Saskatchewan. My mother's in a grave in northern Saskatchewan. And and and so but I look beyond that. I I can look over the tombstone. &gt;&gt; We look beyond that. &gt;&gt; That was a temporal. And these are natural traits &gt;&gt; of this body that's going to pass. But I have a heavenly father &gt;&gt; who has spoken a word. &gt;&gt; He's given a promise. Amen. &gt;&gt; I know that my dad desired, he prayed that, you know, perhaps I would be in the ministry or do something and he thought maybe that I would, you know, go to school and get some advanced education, maybe be a doctor or be a lawyer or something. He he just desired that naturally because he never had the opportunity of that kind of an education. And unfortunately, I didn't have that kind of an opportunity either. I would have loved to gone on to further studies. I didn't have that kind of opportunity. But we have to look beyond that. Because the thing is the direction in your life is not dictated by what you have learned in this life. What you have studied in this life or the opportunities that have come to you in this passing life. Your your your future is in the call of God. &gt;&gt; What has God called you to do? &gt;&gt; Even if God said, "Well, God's only called me. I'm just a farmer. I'm just a I'm just a housewife. I'm that." As long as we are in the call of God, I said, "God, help me." &gt;&gt; And so the scripture says, "And God said to Abraham, let it not be grievous, because for in Isaac shall thy seed be called in the promise. In Isaac, your seed will be called in Isaac." And Apostle Paul then tells us and then this call, let me just stop here for a moment because I'm feeling a little pressed for time. But th this call is a it's a summons. &gt;&gt; Apostle Paul, it's like being accosted. &gt;&gt; Apostle Paul was he was apprehended. He uses the word. &gt;&gt; He was literally apprehended on the way to Damascus. He was on his he he had his own duty. He had his own mandate. He had his own commission. I'm going here. I've studied for this. I've studied at the feet of Ga. I've been under the greatest. These people are heretics. They're opposed to the law, which I am a I'm of the tribe of Benjamin. I'm a I I'm a Hebrew of the Hebrews. Uh I've been a Pharisee. I'm a Pharisee. That's what he said he was. He was all of these things and now he's on a mission &gt;&gt; and God apprehends him. &gt;&gt; Literally accosts him. &gt;&gt; And you know, I don't care whether you've been born &gt;&gt; born in this church or born in a believer's family. There needs to come a time when God literally arrests you &gt;&gt; and you realize you have now become a prisoner. Not to your own ideas, your own thoughts, your own opinion, but you become a you become a prisoner to the promise of this hour. &gt;&gt; To the promise. &gt;&gt; One of the things that has been a disappointment to me, you say, "Well, have you been disappointed?" Yes, I've been disappointed. I find it there's there are people that I encounter in the message and and and their strongest opinion or their strongest conviction or their mission in earth can't be found in the message. &gt;&gt; That is a disappointment. &gt;&gt; Say you got such a marvelous word. &gt;&gt; You've got such an incredible evidence that the Holy Spirit has been sent to guide you. And and we have this a abundance that's been given to us and then we get focused in on something that is entirely something that's in the visible world. Something that consumes us, eats us out, just gnaws at us, and it's all in this temporal world. And I turn around say they're wasting their time. I feel bad they're wasting their time &gt;&gt; because it's I'm not talking about working because that can be a spiritual thing &gt;&gt; but we get consumed people have uh uh say friends I' I've come I've had a lot of meetings in the last even in the last year and I found that people become absolutely consumed with something that they cannot find in the word of God it's not in the scripture but they become just consumed with that I say we need to don't be touched by that &gt;&gt; for in Isaac for in Isaac shall thy seed be called in other words God summons he doesn't only invite you but he commisss a person &gt;&gt; I'm going to be as strong as I possibly can because I don't intend to come back to this &gt;&gt; this congregation ation. I feel that we have a mission. &gt;&gt; I feel that we have been accosted. We have been arrested by Almighty God. &gt;&gt; You've heard me perhaps approach these things before. This is not just a a brother Biscll, but I believe that God has raised up this work and has raised up whatever people have come to this work to provide in some way contribute by your presence, by your prayers, by your giving, by being a part of the body of Christ, being part of this unit of the body of Christ. And if there's any identification mark that that that should come to this group of people that gathers here, I believe that God has raised us up to send forth this word &gt;&gt; to places that otherwise it would never reach. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Furthermore, I'm obsessed. I'm absolutely possessed of that. And I believe that that possession is a Holy Ghost possession. Amen. &gt;&gt; I believe I'm commissioned by God. I believe that you are likewise commissioned by God. And we are not to uh use up our energies and use up our mental resources and use up all of our resources for things that are of nothing. &gt;&gt; They're not. &gt;&gt; And once again, I'm not speaking of your your job or the tasks that we have to do from day to day. But you know it's really amazing. It is really amazing. You'll find out. And one of the things that people are finding out even in what we call this meltdown, you know, it's brought a lot of difficulties. I thank God for it. &gt;&gt; I actually thank God for it. It's good when all the some of the leaves got shook out of the trees. &gt;&gt; It's good when we find out you can do with less. It's good when you find out you don't have to go to McDonald's every day. &gt;&gt; You don't have to go to Starbucks every day. &gt;&gt; It's good when you find out you can actually live on less. &gt;&gt; Some of you are smiling. &gt;&gt; Some are not. &gt;&gt; Let me say this. It could even get a lot worse. &gt;&gt; God never spared his people even of famine. In the New Testament of the book of Acts, the people sent from one place to another, even by the apostles, by the hands of the apostles for those that were in famine. &gt;&gt; The bottom could drop out. &gt;&gt; We could be very much depending on one another. Oh, we're not there yet, but we could be. Am I predicting it? Not at all. I I wouldn't be so foolish as predict anything. You might come to the rosiest time and things might go roaring uh you know the economy roaring again. It could do that. You'll have a greater challenge then to control your spiritual walk &gt;&gt; at that time than you do even at this time. And that's why I said that we showed the pictures and I said I think last week and the week before uh we see the pictures of this group of people that brother Murphy told us of these sisters and and just to take this moment 99% are elderly sisters. They're retired. They're living on uh $100 a month and barely have enough. and and they scraped enough money between them to send $2,000 down to the brothers that were having the uh meetings and they said, "We want to have a part." Brother Murphy said, "I don't even know how they could gather that much. I don't even know how they could give that much and they hardly have enough to live on." But when we see something like that, you know, and I've seen people in very, very poor places and there's something in your heart that you know that craves that kind of simplicity. And I find something about those people that they also have a simple faith. &gt;&gt; They say, "Well, God said it." &gt;&gt; And if he said it, well, &gt;&gt; then we can expect it. &gt;&gt; Now, I'm right at the crux of one of my hungers. says, "Oh God, I would prefer that you remove all these things that are like crutches and make us dependent upon other things and ourselves and so on and so forth." And I would like to just have the Holy Spirit. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I would like such a simple faith. And I'm convicted, friends. I'm convicted. I've been reading as I've been studying for this message. And Brother Brandham says it very, very clear. I'm convicted because we have things right here and we can speak about it. I don't want to just speak about it. I want to be able to say it. I want to be able to declare I believe that. I want to be able to declare I believe that by seeing, not because, you know, I got something within myself this isn't right and it's got to be made right or that, you know, my I think of Ella Joy all the time. &gt;&gt; There's no reason in the world why that girl should not walk perfectly. &gt;&gt; That's just myself. I'm I'm now I'm speaking about personal. I said I would get personal and I don't see any reason in the world why that little girl should not walk perfectly. My challenge is to be able to look at the promise. &gt;&gt; That might be a far off. And I'm not talking about timewise. I'm talking might it might seem so far. It might seem so impossible. But I read where this messenger, this prophet so simply stated time after time after time and he says it so simply, it's the simplicity that convicts me. and faith somehow reaches out. One of the things that happens when difficult times come is people can become a little more desperate. I'm just going to digress for a moment. Brother Nathan, Sister Karen, I'm going to use your testimony. We have a family here, Brother Nathan and Sister Karen Hildebrandt. And after I spoke last Sunday on the realities of God and how it's in that other realm and that other dimension, she felt to send this to me. Before they moved here, they were in Saskatchewan and they went up to northern Saskatchewan for uh to spend a day at the lake with some other people. And uh they were just getting ready now to leave and they had the little trailer hooked up to their car and everything was packed and they were just getting ready to leave. And it was a very very hot day. And so brother Nathan said, "Well, uh you know, and the other families with him, we'll just go and you know, splash in the water a wee bit." What they didn't know is that this lake had a had a cliff and a drop off dropped off like this. And none of these people were swimmers. I think I'm saying it correct. And they said they mostly just wanted to wait out in the cool to cool off. And none of us were aware that the bottom dropped off at a certain point. And brother Nathan with uh another boy was in the water and they were just splashing around and so on so forth. and uh dropped off this edge. And the boy began to panic and and uh get into trouble and is trying to climb on top of Nathan. And the other brother that was on the lake shore, he he thought they're just having fun. And in the meantime, uh, Brother Nathan sunk to the bottom and he started climbing on top of Brother Nathan in his panic. And Nathan kept going down and then he just didn't come back up after a while. And Sister Karen began to scream and uh the boy was staying still above the water kind of dog paddling and uh was struggling to stay up as well. And the brother started heading in our direction. He had an inner tube, but the inner tube was had a hole in it. Wasn't holding air very well. and he yelled at me to get out of the water and go for help to Sister Krenn. She said it was a fair ways to the shore of the camp where there was a camp area including a long boardwalk built across a swampy area and uh I'm just a bridging this a wee bit. It says I got to the top of the hill where the truck was parked and I couldn't go any further. She was running and it was like I couldn't move once I got there and I started screaming for someone to help. I began to cry to God asking him to help us save my husband. And in the meantime, the brother had taken the tube and went down to look for Nathan. and he pulled him out using the inner tube and to to bring him to carry him to shore and then he tried mouth-to-mouth resuscitation and was unsuccessful in reviving Nathan. He then had to leave Nathan to go and pull Christopher because he was losing the battle to stay up. And as he was going out for Chris, he made up his mind that he would pray for Nathan upon his return to shore. In the meantime, Sister Karen is up at the truck and she says, "Something happened and it was like I broke into another dimension or something. I was in another place and I was standing and it was like I was in a vortex, a heavenly vortex." These are her words. And all around me, word was swirling. And I could hear the word being spoken and it was a voice saying, "I am he. Do not fear. Only believe all things are possible." And she said, "I screamed out, Father, my husband, save him. Then more only believe. All things are possible." And I said, 'Lord, this is a reality. Pick him and me too. This is the reality. Lord, take us, Lord. And then a voice came back saying, "It is not yet his time. Only believe. All things are possible." And I and I screamed, "Yes, Lord, I believe. I believe." And at the same instant that I screamed this out, I was backstanding by the truck and could hear the brother who was by this time on his way back to Nathan. And he could see him begin to move. And he screamed out praise to God for giving back Nathan his life. And they took brother Nathan to a hospital. And the doctor said somehow his lungs collapsed and didn't allow any water in his lungs and there was no water in his lungs. I say that God and Sister Corin felt to send this to me just after the service as I was trying to convey to this congregation. There is another land. There's another dimension. It's closer to you than you can imagine. Yeah. &gt;&gt; Even if you let your mind loose right now, you cannot imagine how close it is. Faith is nye. Even in thy mouth. &gt;&gt; Said, "Lord, I believe. &gt;&gt; This is reality. Take us. Take us." Didn't want to come back. Take us. This is what's real. &gt;&gt; My brother, my sister, just one breath away is reality. &gt;&gt; Just one breath away. And a prophet of God is saying to us, young and old, don't look at these natural things. You hear this pain and sorrow and cursing and all of these things which is that's of this world. &gt;&gt; We have a high calling. Believers, friends, we have a high calling. &gt;&gt; I thought I would look and see what the prophet of God I was interested in knowing what was his purpose in life. You know, one of the things he repeats over again, he said, "My purpose," because I decided before I even would read it, I would give myself to the same purpose. He said, "My purpose in life is to stand between the brethren." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And bring unity amongst them. &gt;&gt; And I said, "Amen to God." &gt;&gt; If that was his purpose, that can be my purpose as well. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. not give myself to these little dissensions and little things and insidious things that can be said that only divide people rather than unite them. &gt;&gt; And I say to this congregation, you got a challenge before almighty God that we must not look at these things that are temporal and passing. &gt;&gt; You might say, "Oh, I have an ulterior motive." I forgive you for that. &gt;&gt; I don't have an ulterior motive. I say that's what this congregation needs to needs to believe and needs to practice. &gt;&gt; You need to practice it. &gt;&gt; There's no end, absolutely no end of gossip. There's no end of tailbearing. There's no end of what you can point the finger at at one another unless you make an end of it &gt;&gt; by saying, "I don't see those things. &gt;&gt; I'm going to look at the eternal." &gt;&gt; What do you see? I see a perfect place. I see a perfect people. &gt;&gt; And I believe that man, that woman is a son and daughter of God. &gt;&gt; That's what I see. &gt;&gt; You want to find fault, &gt;&gt; you're in the right place. &gt;&gt; You want to find fault, you'll go no place. That's right. That's right. &gt;&gt; Until you and I learn that we must look beyond &gt;&gt; this. We must look to that which is eternal. &gt;&gt; We must look to the unseen. &gt;&gt; Because the whole Bible from one from Genesis through to Revelation is of people. The whole book of Revelation isn't anything that was temporal. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The Apostle John didn't see that which was temporal. The whole book. Amen. &gt;&gt; And the prophet said, "That's our book." &gt;&gt; Are you with me? &gt;&gt; And we take these things too lightly. We take these things. Oh, that's what the Apostle Paul said. Oh, yeah. While we look at the things, well, I but I live in a different life and I have I'm in a different age and I'm Yeah, we sure are in a different age. But we need it more than even they did. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. We've got more enticements. We've got more temptations. That's Satan. This is Satan's Eden. &gt;&gt; And he has developed it &gt;&gt; to the ultimate degree. &gt;&gt; And I say friends, we need by God's power to cut that down &gt;&gt; in every life and give ourselves to what the word of God has promised. &gt;&gt; And I have a promise of this age. And I just decided I would see what what the purpose of God. in brother Brandham's life was &gt;&gt; and he said you know he said this he got down he said he was in he was a Baptist and then out of that and then the Presbyterians offered him something offered him the moon and different groups and I lived in that time when they were offering him things and some of the others that raised into great ministries at that time they caved into it and they went the way of prosperity and big things. But brother Vanom, he turned it down and turned it down. Then he says, "Then I found myself among the Pentecostal people." And he said, "They were despised people. They were called holy rulers and they had all kinds of nasty names for them." and he was preaching on Moses and he said this. Moses didn't merely become a sympathizer saying, "Well, I feel sorry for the Hebrews and they're out there and so on and so forth and I believe they're right and I believe they're God's people." No. He said he went out and became one of them. &gt;&gt; He says, "And when I saw the Pentecostal people," he said, I decided that I would become I wouldn't just be a sympathizer. I would go out and become one of them. &gt;&gt; Amen. So he took this marvelous gift and he took this incredible calling that he had. He knew he knew he was called to be the messenger, the second coming of Jesus Christ. And I will call I will go out and be a part of them. And he came out and was a part of them. And then he said, I found that they were as broken up &gt;&gt; as the others. &gt;&gt; And I decided to stand in the middle. Amen. &gt;&gt; I decided to stand and bridge the gap. &gt;&gt; I decided to give myself to uniting the brethren together. &gt;&gt; And whatever you think and whatever you you you can be given over to your own decision, but I've dedicated myself to that long time ago. And and I'm personally I am absolutely unmovable, unshakable. I'm too far down the road to be moved. this message as far as we can thrust it. That's what I intend to do. &gt;&gt; I don't intend to get caught up with my own little world or or my own little ministry or some other little thing. I'm going to get this message out. I don't have some little uh subject to promote or something. I want to get the message out to people. I want to be able to walk up on other side and we are going to be there just like we're here even more real than we are here. And I want to be able to take people's hands. I want to be able to embrace them. And I would like, if God would grant us, I say, "Oh, God, grant me the opportunity to get this word into more hands and more people, I'd like to see whatever color, whatever race, I'd like them to be able to read a message book and have it touch their heart like it touches mine." &gt;&gt; It doesn't give me any joy. I read I read and studied this week and oh, how wonderful some of these things are. And it opens up the scriptures. It makes the scriptures alive. And I begin to read, "In Isaac, in Isaac shall I see be called." And I realized I'd been called. A promise from God, right? The very essence of that that very promise, there was a voice that ran out and arrested me someplace. &gt;&gt; And it went out and arrested you when you least expected it. &gt;&gt; And God obligated us. We've received much and we have to much has been given. We must give much. &gt;&gt; That's why we're doing everything that we can to get the message or get a place from where the message can spread. Even in Moscow, wherever it is, that sounds like old. I hope that doesn't sound like old humrum to you. I'm glad for every breth, and you'll hear probably more tonight. I'm glad that God has allowed ministers, young ministers to raise up out of this message &gt;&gt; and send them out from this place. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And if people look to this place or look to you, you should be thankful for that. &gt;&gt; I think God's given us a great privilege. &gt;&gt; He's given us a highest honor. &gt;&gt; I wouldn't want I wouldn't want to just be enclosed in a little group, us four, no more. and we just no matter what we say and how we rejoice in it, it wouldn't do me any I wouldn't have the satisfaction. That's just me. I wouldn't have the satisfaction. I don't want to sit at the marriage table. And if someone look across and said, "You could have sent it to me. You had the you had the wherewithal to get it to me." And God did it anyway. I don't know how this is going to work, but the scripture says, "Don't let any man take your crown." Don't let any man &gt;&gt; take your crown. &gt;&gt; There's rewards. And a prophet of God said, "There's too little said about the rewards." There's a reward for you. friends. I don't I I really don't care how it goes out. You may wonder why perhaps why we do certain things. Not long ago, brother John Brother John Stall senior took four of his grandchildren went back to the colonies. And maybe some of you from the colonies, you have your opinion about that. And that's fine. I I'm here. This is this is my my place to be able to say say, "Why did I do that? Why' I assist? Why would we assist as a church to send them back there? I just think it's just that important that somebody who's bound and crying finding is there something real. Even if that young person doesn't say a thing that they can look into the face of somebody say they're different. &gt;&gt; That's a different kind of a young man, different kind of a young lady. What makes them like that? &gt;&gt; I can tell you what. It's not just a long dress that makes them. is not the polka dots that make them. It's not some man's doctrine that makes them. It is something that from the unseen realm, &gt;&gt; they have been arrested. &gt;&gt; At some point in their life, they became arrested. &gt;&gt; You young men and young women, I declare to you, you have a tremendous responsibility. If time goes on, I may not be here. Some of these other brothers may not be here. Who's going to rise up? &gt;&gt; Who's going to give themselves to this unseen realm? &gt;&gt; This unseen realm. Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Do you see it? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And the unseen. I I have to speak from memory now. And my memor is not that good. But brother Brandham comes in that message looking at the unseen. And this catches me. He says, "But I see." Said, "Oh God, I want to see what he saw." &gt;&gt; He said, "I see a church." &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. He saw a church rising. &gt;&gt; He saw a millennium. &gt;&gt; He saw a perfect church. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And with all that chaos that was going on and all that confusion and all that ridicule and all that criticism and he was waiting his way through, but he wasn't looking at that. &gt;&gt; I tell you friends, he could have filled books. He could have filled many more books in his messages. He could have filled them on all of the troubles and the things and the people that came against him. He could have filled books on it. He ignored it. &gt;&gt; And he looked to see a church. He looked to see a people. &gt;&gt; And he said, "Many of these brethren are not here now. They've gone." &gt;&gt; But he said, "I saw them &gt;&gt; over there." [Music] &gt;&gt; I hope he saw me. &gt;&gt; I hope he saw me. See, I'm not just preaching, friends. I'm done. I've got to quit. I'm too burdened. I'm so burdened. People wonder why you go away. Why do you go and have these meetings? Because what I can never never tell you this influence and I happen to know this influence blew through and this doctrine blew through and that thing this hardship blew through and this thing blew through. People are hurt. People are wounded. People are discouraged. And I just think if I can just do something, maybe I can just pour some oil. &gt;&gt; Maybe we can do something to pull them together. &gt;&gt; And I can tell you that even in this last 12 months, we've seen some astounding victories. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And I say to those that, you know, sometimes come along with me, I say, you know what's the saddest thing? I can't tell the church this. I can't it can't go out to the world. I just can't go everywhere. I can't tell I can't tell the congregation that the most glorious things not able to tell them. All I can just tell you in a veiled way, incredible things. people who haven't fellowshipped together for years. Coming together, not just coming together suspiciously, coming together and rejoicing, &gt;&gt; coming together and hugging one another. Come together. Isn't this worth it? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Say, hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Want to be doing that to the last moment that we possibly can. &gt;&gt; Amen. And I'm doing everything I can. I want to say to this congregation, I trust that you'll do everything that you can to look to the unseen. Don't fret. Don't worry. Don't stress. Don't be overly anxious. Just say, "Lord, I'm here. What I heard this morning, I want to I I want to do my part. I want to be part of that." It might be the person that's sitting next to you. It might be another family. How no Who who knows how God keeps track of things? God's depending on you. Oh, I just want to bear my heart so much. There's a lot of people in sitting in this congregation. You You just don't know who you're affecting. And I trust you'll affect them positively. &gt;&gt; I'll I'll close with this. There's one person, I'm sorry. I think Sister Lan, I just had to leave. But I know she's a sister that prays. I know she's a sister that's burdened. My wife and I have lived here for almost over 40 years, I guess. We've never gone down into Vancouver and just get a hotel and stay overnight. My wife was a little nervous. She says, "We got all these points with British Airways. We're going to lose them. Unless we fly someplace, we got to we got to activate it and then it'll be good for another year." Says, "Or the only other thing we can do is go and stay at a hotel." So I said, "Okay, let's do it." So they gave me a nice hotel and they gave it real cheap and they and then they said, "And this will include your full breakfast as well." Well, it's getting better all the time. And when we got there, they gave us a uh gave us a coupon says 25% off your for your dinner tonight. And I said, "This is getting better all the time. Maybe if I stand here long enough, I might get this whole thing free." And uh and I said, "Well, you know, one thing, my wife's been wanting a pair of needing a pair of sunglasses. She doesn't know it, but I she has a pair, but I said, "They're no good, and I want you to get another pair of sunglasses." So, we're going to look. So, here we are. And I thought, "Oh, there's, you know, there's frame." You don't mind me telling this? I said, "There's frame places all over the place." You know, I I we'll go here to Pacific Center. We'll go down there. So, anyway, we go into the mall where we're at, and there's no there's no glass place there. Okay, let's get out of here. We go down the street cuz I want to get back first Saturday, you know, I give over to my studies. And this was first thing in the morning after breakfast. And so we we go over to Pacific Center. And I mean, you know, this is hundreds of stores there. So we're walking down Pacific Center. We go to one of these things that tell you what's all in there. There's only two only two places that sell glasses. Wow. My goodness. Okay. So we go into the first one. They said, "We don't sell prescription glasses. we only sell sunglasses. I said, "No, it's no good. My wife needs a prescription." So, he says, "Well, just across just across the lake, just across the alleyway here. Store's on the other side." So, we just walk over there, walk in the store, one one girl standing there. So, we walk up and she's real nice. And then she got busy with somebody else and we waited and then so she starts to show us and works with my wife and everything else. And we're all we're there about a half an hour and we're we're all done. So I said, "Do you have a card? We'll have to tell you what our my my wife's prescription is." "Oh yeah, here here it is. Right here." Hands me a card. And I could see it was Italian. So I was just going to tell her we were in Italy not long ago, but before I got to that, I I tried to pronounce her first name. I said, "Is that am I pronouncing it right?" "Yeah." And my wife says, "You wouldn't be Lana's sister, would you?" "Yeah." She said, "I'm Who are you?" I says, "I'm her pastor." "Pastor Ed, you brother Ed, reach across and and you're Ruth?" "Yes." "Yeah." So, we say, "Oh, that was a nice accident. I don't think it was an accident." It brought a whole flood of things. We're able to talk about her mother in the hospital and all these things. And and I haven't even had a chance to tell Sister Lana yet. I know that Lana has prayed for her sister. And here once again once in 40 years you go down you stay in a certain place and you walk into the second store and talk to one of our sister sister in the flesh and it all comes back again the whole flood sraise &gt;&gt; we don't even know &gt;&gt; you say who guided our footsteps the holy spirit guided our footsteps that's how that's who's guiding you &gt;&gt; don't even know it but he the same sovereignty is guiding your footsteps. Hallelujah to God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Well, &gt;&gt; we're going to close. Long ways to go, but I'm going to close cuz we got Brother Murphy tonight and I know he's loaded. &gt;&gt; Amen. When you get someone like Brother Murphy, Brother DJ, some of these brothers, Brother John, some of his young brothers, you don't have to pray that they'll get loaded. You have to pray they'll be able to get unloaded. Pray brother John is making having to make a decision right now too. The brothers and brother Milco just came back from Serbia and this is the third year they're having a annual meeting there just for the third time. I was there the first time and some other brothers last year and now they've asked for some a couple of brothers and brother John to go there and that'll be end of August Lord willing and he'll be speaking there. So we need to we're happy we can participate in this. The same thing is happening there. Brother John God is bringing people are going to come from Romania. This has never happened like that before. and come from Romania and and all different countries, maybe from Hungary and different places in there and are really looking forward to it. Amen. Why don't we stand? Would you stand with me, please? Brother Rod, I wonder if you can help me with the song. I looked for it in the book. I couldn't find it. There is an unseen hand. Do we have it on the screen? Okay. &gt;&gt; Before we sing, let's Would you pray with me? &gt;&gt; Heavenly Father, there were times and there are times in every minister's life. He just bears his heart and the people understand. You've given us such wonderful, encouraging and understanding people. And we do not know, Lord, how near we are to our going home, whether it's in the next five minutes or the next five years or whatever it is, but we want to be faithful. And like your messenger said, he wished that he had so many lives to live and so many more years. And the people that you've gathered here, Lord, some are visitors. And I pray that they will understand also that they didn't come to visit by accident. They came that something might touch their hearts as well. Lord, uh the people that were gathered today, they didn't know what they were going to hear. And I didn't know exactly how it was going to come out, but I did pray. And we had prayer this morning in the study, Father. And I felt your presence as brother Rod prayed, oh God, that we would just utter and say the right things. I pray even now that you will send Lord, Brother Murphy, to this pulpit tonight, if you give us this hour, this time together. And I pray, Father, wherever this message is being declared, give your servants, Father, I pray you'll give them supreme control and power in the Holy Spirit. And may they utter your word. May they declare it, Lord. Give this message a mighty voice in these last times. Oh God, we're not getting caught up just in some church order or some format, but we want to be caught up with what you're doing. Do the exceedingly abundantly above all we could ask or think, Lord. And we thank you as I gave the testimony of Sister Karen and brother Nathan. We're thankful, Father, you kept that water out of his lungs. We're thankful that he can stand here and sing to the glory of God. We're thankful that we're not talking about a God of history, but we're talking about a God of the now. &gt;&gt; What you did yesterday, you'll do today. &gt;&gt; Inspire all those that are listening, Father, in streaming. And there may be needs and sickness and whatever more. I pray that you'll send a mighty force and power out. And Lord, I pray that your people will be much much builded up and benefited in Jesus name. Bless us now as we come to a close. Amen. There is an unseen hand. There is a seed hand to me that leads in ways I cannot see while going through this world Oh, this still messes [Music] me as I go. Trusting to [Music] the sweet that guides me through this [Applause] And so sweet [Music] the unseen this hand has laid. through shadows dream and wildly I have no fear I don't will lead me to thy home with sin The soul can come. I'm trusting you. [Applause] to the unseen hand that guides me through this and some sweet [Music] guided by the unseen. I want to leave this with you before we sing the last verse in chorus. When a man once catches that vision of the invisible God and know that he's always present, there is something that stabilizes that man's thinking. &gt;&gt; I think that there could be a 100% of us say, "God, grant that to me." &gt;&gt; It stabilizes his actions. Say, "Oh God, do that for me." &gt;&gt; And in the time of distress and trouble, it'll still make him look upward and above the things that are happening around him &gt;&gt; because he's looking at the unseen yet by promise. Amen. &gt;&gt; And then this is what I was trying to quote to you and now I want to give it as he said it said this is where I didn't come to be a sympathizer but I came to be a part of them. He says and now I'm a holy roller and by faith I believe that that's the bunch &gt;&gt; that will go in the rapture. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And I would rather have it than all the PhD and the DDS. that the church world can afford. What's he talking about? So, I'd sooner have that than have all this that I can see, all this fame and all this attention. I'd sooner have that. &gt;&gt; In other words, become so so focused on a on a vision of the unseen. &gt;&gt; It's not it's not filmy. It's not flooy stuff, friends. It's reality. &gt;&gt; I declare to you that is what's real. And this is what he concludes by saying. He says, "Then then when by faith you walk by faith by the unseen." &gt;&gt; He's saying, "Listen, I walk by the unseen." He said, "I see &gt;&gt; a church going in the rapture." &gt;&gt; God, give me that prophet's eyes right now. I pray that God give this congregation those prophetic eyes. I see not just something we learned, but I see it. &gt;&gt; I see a church going in the rapture. &gt;&gt; I see Jesus coming for his bride. &gt;&gt; I see a little neglected bunch of people who are laughed at and made fun of go in the rapture one day. I'd rather be with them than all the groups that I know of in all the world. For by faith we see by the unseen. Hallelujah. [Music] &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; When you shake hands with the people today and greet them, I trust there'll be something even different beating in your heart because you won't just see a man, a woman, a brother or sister, but you'll see beyond that. You'll see them sitting at the marriage. You'll see the rapture taking place. You'll see the atoms in their very bodies being changed. That's what the word has declared. &gt;&gt; We're looking at the promise. &gt;&gt; We shall be, my dear friends. I probably won't get to shake your hands, but we shall be &gt;&gt; changed. &gt;&gt; Transformed &gt;&gt; in a moment, &gt;&gt; in a twinkling of an eye. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And the promise for that has already been delivered. &gt;&gt; God sent Elijah and delivered your promise. [Music] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Let's sing these last verse and I urge you to hold to this un unseen hand. I I long to see my Savior's face and sing the story. Sing my grace, my grace and there is. Oh, I'll praise him for his [Music] [Applause] [Music] guides me through. [Music] Heat. Heat. and still the unseen hand. I'm trusting [Applause] the unseen that me through this. strength still [Music] the I want you to turn around and shake hands with as many of those as you can from where you're standing and not only say God bless you but with that handshake you're declaring I'll see you on the other side too. We'll do this again. Amen. Why don't we sing the chorus one more time, brother Owen, please? God bless you in the earth. hand that guides me through this wey land and some sweet tent.

We just say in this atmosphere when you feel free, you're dismissed in Jesus name. We're going to have a glorious day. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; I just feel like worshiping him and giving him praise and thanking him. Oh, he's so wonderful. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. a prophet of God always said his one of his whole purpose in life was just to have that communion. He said I live to have this communion with him. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; You know that did it created such a hunger in my own heart for even more. Oh let me just live that. Let that be my whole purpose in a day just to have that communion with him. &gt;&gt; Oh thank you Lord Jesus. Thank you Lord Jesus. God bless you people. God bless you brothers and sisters.
