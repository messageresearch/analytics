[21:17] Amen. I'm going to ask brother Tom
[21:21] open the service this morning in a word
[21:22] of prayer.
[21:24] got a a request this morning uh email
[21:28] that I received from uh brother Ken Fury
[21:30] up in Edmonton who had a brother uh
[21:34] request that uh we pray this morning for
[21:38] um a nephew of a brother by the name of
[21:41] uh Lorie Mloud and uh he's been
[21:45] diagnosed with cancer. He's going in for
[21:47] surgery this week and is praying that
[21:49] God would heal him and grant healing for
[21:52] his soul as well.
[21:54] And uh our sister Rebecca Walsher is
[21:57] requesting prayer this morning for her
[22:00] uncle who was diagnosed with an
[22:02] aggressive form of brain cancer in
[22:03] November. Uh he just received Christ in
[22:06] the last two weeks and is uh emailed the
[22:10] family just uh asking forgiveness for
[22:13] some of the things he's done. Um and uh
[22:17] his daughter emailed today and asked if
[22:20] we would pray that he would be well
[22:21] enough to come home for a few days over
[22:24] the Christmas season. So I want to
[22:25] remember this brother in prayer this
[22:28] morning. Brother Vio
[22:30] [Music]
[22:31] uh and is requesting prayer this
[22:33] morning. Um he's traveling uh with
[22:37] sister Mara uh to see sister Mara's
[22:40] mother. is very close to death and uh
[22:43] he's brother Vai is requesting strength
[22:45] for sister Mara and that at this time of
[22:47] deep grief would be used for God to do
[22:49] an eternal work. So you want to remember
[22:52] uh the Moscu family this morning. Um,
[22:57] Sister Yola is requesting prayer for a
[22:59] sister Helina from Poland who lost her
[23:02] father in February and now her mother
[23:05] has been diagnosed with diabetes. And
[23:07] next Wednesday, she is scheduled to have
[23:10] part of her foot amputated. She's asking
[23:13] for prayer for healing and strength for
[23:14] the whole family as they're going
[23:16] through these hard times. They uh watch
[23:19] the services over the internet. and so
[23:21] may be watching us this morning. We want
[23:22] to unite our hearts with him this
[23:24] morning. Um want to remember brother
[23:27] Ernie Veloe is going back to the
[23:29] Philippines and also u there's a request
[23:32] that we remember brother Isaac
[23:33] Laontaine's father-in-law Steve Johnson
[23:36] who uh has been diagnosed with uh tumors
[23:39] in his liver and they're going to be
[23:40] doing a biopsy tomorrow and want to pray
[23:42] that God's will would be done. Amen. So
[23:46] uh we want to remember these requests.
[23:47] If you're listening on the internet and
[23:49] you've got a need, you just lift it
[23:51] before the Lord. Would you go to prayer
[23:53] and uh if you're here this morning,
[23:55] you've got a need, just lift your hand
[23:56] before the Lord. He knows your need.
[23:58] Amen, brother Tom.
[24:03] Lord, a very appropriate song this
[24:06] morning. Be it unto me
[24:09] according to thy word. And so Lord, on
[24:12] the basis of your word, you said, "Ask
[24:14] anything in my name, believing, and you
[24:17] shall have what you ask." And so Lord,
[24:20] in the precious name of Jesus Christ, we
[24:24] lay our hands upon these requests as
[24:26] brother Rod has spoken them. Hands have
[24:29] been raised around this little
[24:31] sanctuary. Lord, needs are here, Lord
[24:35] Jesus. We've been remembering in our
[24:37] hearts, Sister Vanessa.
[24:39] Lord, we're believing for a supernatural
[24:41] move of God. Lord, you're still a
[24:44] beautiful star. You're the one that held
[24:47] those seven stars in your hand. Lord,
[24:50] you led wise men, Lord, to the word.
[24:53] You're leading men and women again to
[24:55] the promises of your word. And Lord, I'm
[24:59] praying, God, that you will meet every
[25:01] need
[25:02] according to your word. We're going to
[25:05] ask abundantly, Lord. cancers may they
[25:07] leave in the name of Jesus Christ.
[25:10] Diabetes Lord may it go in the name of
[25:13] Jesus Christ. Whatever the affliction,
[25:16] whatever the disease, we resist it in
[25:18] the name above all names. Hart the
[25:22] herald angels sing. Glory to the King of
[25:25] Kings. Lord, we want to join our voices
[25:28] with those holy angels this morning
[25:30] because we believe you're a supernatural
[25:32] being and you work in mysterious ways
[25:36] your wonders to perform deal with lives.
[25:39] Lord, may they come to you not to a babe
[25:43] in a manger, but to a savior, a healer,
[25:47] a redeemer.
[25:49] God, meet these needs we pray. Move in
[25:52] our midst, Lord. Anoint your servant
[25:54] this morning. Anoint our eyes and our
[25:57] ears to hear what the spirit would say
[26:00] to the church. Move us, Lord, into a
[26:03] love relationship with you and you
[26:06] alone. We pray that you will speak to us
[26:09] deeply on this Christmas season. Lord,
[26:12] that we could come into that chamber, be
[26:16] sweet Holy Spirit, and speak to me
[26:20] gently. Would you anoint brother Ed and
[26:22] anoint us? We pray. and meet these
[26:26] precious needs, Lord. Precious needs,
[26:29] Lord. I pray, God, you'll
[26:31] supernaturally.
[26:33] Touch each and everyone.
[26:36] And Father, we will be sure to give you
[26:39] then the glory, the honor, and praise.
[26:42] Do your holy name. We commit this
[26:44] service, all the songs, all the worship.
[26:48] May it just be pleasing in your eyes. We
[26:50] pray in Jesus name. Amen. Amen.
[26:58] You may be seated.

[27:30] into so uh we're happy to have uh the
[27:33] Dingwall family here with us and want to
[27:35] officially welcome them to the assembly
[27:38] and I'm sure everybody knows Brother
[27:40] Kim, Sister Hedi. We're happy to have
[27:42] them here. Um Jake and Aaron and couple
[27:47] of my grandkids are down here. If you
[27:49] see some kids walking around look like
[27:51] little Norwegians
[27:54] and dressed like them, uh, Brother Brett
[27:57] will be happy this morning. We got them
[27:59] dressed in the Norwegian national
[28:00] costume. So, so uh um we're happy to
[28:04] have each and every one of you here this
[28:06] morning and um and trust that God would
[28:09] bless you this Christmas season and be a
[28:11] real testimony to your to your family.
[28:14] Good to see Jonathan, brother Jonathan
[28:15] Coral. Good to see you here. And if we
[28:17] missed anyone, uh, just forgive us.
[28:20] We're going to take a few minutes, uh,
[28:22] Jeremy, if you can get the clip ready.
[28:24] And, uh, and the brothers in the video
[28:27] room, if you could make sure that the
[28:29] musicians could see what's happening
[28:31] here. Sometimes they feel left out and,
[28:33] uh, they contribute a wonderful part to
[28:36] the service and we don't want to leave
[28:37] them left out of anything. U,, we're
[28:39] going to play an introduction.
[28:41] Uh you've heard about the witnessing
[28:43] website that Jeremy's been working on
[28:45] and and a few others here at the church
[28:47] and uh unfortunately it's too few
[28:50] although a lot of people have
[28:51] volunteered uh not very many people have
[28:54] actually uh come through but we we are
[28:56] getting things done and we wanted to
[28:58] share with you. This is not in finished
[29:00] form, but it will be very soon. And I
[29:03] wanted to give you a little taste of
[29:04] what it will look like and hopefully
[29:05] encourage some of you uh to uh that
[29:08] maybe uh haven't helped to help out a
[29:11] little bit. Um the purpose of the site
[29:13] is to introduce people
[29:16] to the message. Those that haven't heard
[29:17] of the message, we want to introduce the
[29:19] message to them. Brother Brandham said,
[29:21] "We are God's people all marching
[29:23] together with one great purpose."
[29:28] &gt;&gt; Amen. to win souls for Christ.
[29:31] &gt;&gt; And he said, "May it ever be that way."
[29:34] &gt;&gt; And I want to thank brother James Rosac
[29:37] who is instrumental up in Edmonton in
[29:39] putting this together. Brother Tom,
[29:41] Brother Michael Ray, Phil Ashdown,
[29:44] Jeremy uh um and uh for this little clip
[29:48] here. We've had a few others who are
[29:50] helping in kind of the detail. We'll
[29:51] talk about that a little bit more. So
[29:53] maybe Jeremy, you could roll the first
[29:54] clip. And the music on this was played
[29:57] by our brother uh Philip Ashdown.
[30:02] [Music]
[31:12] And then it introduces people to the uh
[31:15] the photograph. Now, if you uh turn um
[31:21] Jeremy and go to the second sign,
[31:24] we want to introduce
[31:28] &gt;&gt; you. You've had a I see a great crash of
[31:31] some sort. It's an accident. Yes.
[31:33] &gt;&gt; And you it was a car wreck
[31:36] &gt;&gt; and you were thrown in the air like
[31:38] that.
[31:38] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[31:39] &gt;&gt; And it strang somewhere in your neck and
[31:41] caused a a cancer to come into your neck
[31:44] or
[31:46] &gt;&gt; and you're some sort of a teach in the
[31:48] scripture and you believe that Jesus
[31:52] Christ makes you well. I do.
[31:55] Father God, in the name of thy son Jesus
[31:59] Christ
[32:01] on the authority of God's word by a
[32:04] dying woman, I ask this evil thing to
[32:08] leave her. Satan, you are exposed. So
[32:12] come out of the woman as the church of
[32:15] the living God calls for you to leave in
[32:18] the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.
[32:21] [Music]
[32:23] &gt;&gt; Amen. Now, uh, we're going to show one
[32:25] other clip. There's going to be and this
[32:28] the whole purpose of this initial
[32:30] introduction for the website is to show
[32:32] people what the ministry of brother
[32:36] Brandon was about, but we also want to
[32:38] bring it up to date to what's happening
[32:40] today. And uh, we've got a clip that
[32:43] includes a few people um
[32:47] that, you know, who have experienced the
[32:49] touch of God in their lives. Jeremy
[33:11] Hi, my name is Benjamin Derti. I broke
[33:14] my neck while I was bouncing on the
[33:15] trampoline and the next day the Lord
[33:18] healed me.
[33:19] My name is David Law and I had flesh
[33:22] eating disease in my shoulder and a few
[33:25] of my organs. And uh the Lord Jesus
[33:27] healed me and I have absolutely 100% use
[33:31] of all my body.
[33:35] I didn't lose anything.
[33:39] &gt;&gt; My name is Beth Dingwall. When I was
[33:40] eight, I was diagnosed with leukemia
[33:43] alll Philadelphia positive. The Lord has
[33:46] healed me miraculously.
[33:49] Hi, my name is Shayla and when I was 3
[33:51] months old um I started having seizures
[33:54] and about after a month in the hospital
[33:57] um I got sent home and the doctors told
[33:59] my parents that I would be mentally
[34:01] for the rest of my life and my
[34:03] parents and believers around the world
[34:05] were praying for me and the Lord totally
[34:07] touched me and I'm 100%.
[34:11] [Music]
[34:14] &gt;&gt; Praise God.
[34:16] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[34:25] Now
[34:27] the whole purpose of that again is to
[34:29] attract people
[34:31] to see that there has been a sign in
[34:33] this day and then we've got a whole
[34:35] detailed website behind it and that's
[34:37] where we really need some help. Um how
[34:40] many were here last Sunday morning?
[34:43] Men. Brother Biscll talked about Mark
[34:46] 14:8, the woman with the alabaster
[34:48] block. She hath done what she could.
[34:51] Brother Brandon said, "What our main
[34:53] purpose is here for is to capture the
[34:55] unbeliever to a faith in God. That's
[34:58] what we want to do is to see the sinner
[35:00] converted to a living faith in our Lord
[35:03] Jesus Christ." And that's our main
[35:06] thing.
[35:06] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[35:07] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[35:09] And uh you know what I'm going to ask
[35:12] some of you and I and this is
[35:13] particularly the young people if you're
[35:15] grade nine and up you can write
[35:17] something that people can understand.
[35:20] And uh you don't have to say I don't
[35:22] know where to start. We've already got a
[35:24] good start but we do need some help. And
[35:27] uh there are two kinds of people.
[35:29] There's people get things done and
[35:31] there's people that never get anything
[35:32] done. And personally I want to be
[35:34] somebody who can get thing done for the
[35:36] kingdom of God. Amen. So, if you're
[35:39] interested, go to the Bible way website.
[35:41] You'll see a link on the bottom asking
[35:42] for help and uh we can really use it as
[35:46] much as we can get. As much as your time
[35:48] as you can give us, we can use. Amen.
[35:51] &gt;&gt; You excited about what God is doing?
[35:53] &gt;&gt; Praise God. Amen. We're going to have uh
[35:56] I think a uh there's a baby dedication.
[36:01] Um and then the uh the school choir is
[36:04] going to sing for us. But before they
[36:05] do, I want to sing maybe a little
[36:07] chorus. Go tell it on the mountain.
[36:09] Amen. We want to stand up and tell what
[36:11] God has done for us. Amen. So, let's
[36:14] stand together. Now, this is not the
[36:16] traditional version of this song. Uh
[36:18] I've been listening to Mahelia Jackson
[36:20] sing it all week. And uh so, if you
[36:23] don't know it or you know another
[36:25] version, just listen to me first. You
[36:27] can sing the chorus. And if you know the
[36:29] the verses uh the way she sings it, well
[36:33] then you can join along with me.
[36:37] Go tell it on the mountain,
[36:41] over the hills and far away.
[36:46] Go tell it on the mountain
[36:50] that Jesus Christ is born.
[36:56] The shepherds kept their watching
[37:01] over their sheep at night.
[37:05] Behold a star from heaven
[37:09] that shone a holy light. Halleluah.
[37:14] Go tell it on the mountain,
[37:19] over the hills,
[37:21] everywhere.
[37:24] Go tell him on the mountain
[37:28] that Jesus Christ is born.
[37:32] The shepherds fear and tremble
[37:37] when low above the earth
[37:41] rang out the angel chorus
[37:45] that he savior.
[37:49] Everybody go tell it on mountain
[37:54] over the hill. Everywhere
[38:00] tell it on mountain
[38:03] that Jesus Christ is born.
[38:08] They found a lonely manger where the
[38:12] humble Christ was born.
[38:16] And God sent out salvation
[38:20] on that blessed Christmas.
[38:23] Hallelujah.
[38:26] Go tell it on the mountain
[38:30] over the hills and everywhere.
[38:34] Go tell it on the mountain
[38:38] that Jesus Christ did for
[38:42] and he brought with him forgiveness.
[38:46] He lived to show his way.
[38:50] He came to redeem every sinner and to
[38:55] wash our sins away. Hallelujah.
[39:00] Go tell it all those.
[39:04] Oh, thank you
[39:06] everywhere.
[39:08] Go tell it on the mountain that Jesus
[39:13] Christ. Hallelujah.
[39:16] Go tell it on the mountain.
[39:23] Everywhere.
[39:25] Go tell it on the mountain.
[39:29] Jesus Christ is born.
[39:33] Go tell it on the mountain
[39:38] over the hill and
[39:42] go tell it on the mountain.
[39:46] Jesus Christ.
[39:49] Hallelujah.
[39:51] That's our commission. You may have your
[39:52] seats.
[39:55] Amen.
[39:58] It's a full day, folks.
[40:00] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[40:03] &gt;&gt; Brother Donald has been coming to the
[40:06] church for how many years, brother John?
[40:08] &gt;&gt; Since 1996.
[40:10] &gt;&gt; Since 1996.
[40:12] And through uh our sister Ada has met
[40:15] Alda.
[40:17] And God brought them together. And now
[40:19] this morning we have Gabriel
[40:23] in another form.
[40:26] And Gabriel means a warrior of God.
[40:30] So this morning we want to dedicate
[40:33] Gabriel to be not just a warrior but a
[40:36] warrior of the word.
[40:38] &gt;&gt; A warrior from his youth. One that can
[40:40] stand with thus sayeth the Lord. And you
[40:43] know the wonderful thing about the Bible
[40:44] is is it's such a a guiding light for
[40:47] us. Proverbs 22:6
[40:51] says, "Train up a child and the way it
[40:54] shall go and when he is old, he will not
[40:57] depart from it." You know this wonderful
[41:00] thing about Jesus Christ is that he
[41:03] being the word lived the word that was
[41:07] laying in the word and here now he was
[41:10] born raised up and when he came to his
[41:13] commission the Bible says in Luke 4 and
[41:16] Jesus came to Nazareth where he was born
[41:21] and was brought up and as was his custom
[41:25] he went into the synagogue train a child
[41:28] up the Word of God when it grows old, it
[41:31] shall not depart. May the Holy Spirit so
[41:35] train him up. And may the presence of
[41:38] God so protect this child that he would
[41:41] become a warrior of God. Amen.
[41:50] Let's pray.
[41:54] Lord Jesus,
[41:56] this morning cradled in my arms is a
[41:58] gift that you have given to a couple
[42:01] Lord that have given their lives to you.
[42:04] You have blessed their home. You united
[42:06] them together and Lord this child was
[42:08] born Gabriel warrior Lord
[42:12] &gt;&gt; of the Lord. We pray Lord that your hand
[42:15] will ever rest upon him. Amen.
[42:17] &gt;&gt; That you will keep him Lord Jesus under
[42:19] the blanket of your presence. May you
[42:22] put a wall of fire around him Lord. And
[42:25] father from his youth and growing up may
[42:27] hear of this Jesus Christ, Savior, Lord,
[42:32] King of Kings. And Father, may he know
[42:35] you at a young age. And may he Lord be a
[42:39] testimony of your grace. Father, we're
[42:43] asking that your blessings will rest
[42:44] upon this child as we dedicate him this
[42:48] morning to you. Mother and father has
[42:50] brought him to the house of God. That he
[42:52] be dedicated before God. And so we offer
[42:55] him this morning as a love gift to you,
[42:58] Father. And may your grace ever rest and
[43:02] guide and lead him through life's
[43:04] journey. We pray as we dedicate
[43:08] little Gabriel to you in Jesus name.
[43:12] Amen.
[43:14] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[43:18] May the Lord bless you.
[43:26] &gt;&gt; Thanks, brother Tom. Um, we have um the
[43:30] Bible Waych Christian Academy, the
[43:32] school kids are going to come and sing.
[43:34] Maybe they can come at this time. As
[43:36] they're coming, we've got a couple of
[43:37] announcement. Um,
[43:40] we got uh the first young peoples uh of
[43:44] the new year will be the second Friday
[43:46] of January, January the 12th here at the
[43:48] church. And the age group for young
[43:51] people's is those that were in senior
[43:53] camp in 2006. So if you were at senior
[43:56] camp uh this year, then you're welcome
[44:00] to come to young people's. Also, we've
[44:02] had a request from the deacons that um
[44:05] we be very careful and mindful of our
[44:07] neighbors. You know, we're commanded to
[44:10] love our neighbors as ourselves.
[44:12] And uh neighbors have lawns, they have
[44:15] driveways, and we don't want to park in
[44:17] their driveways or, you know, blocking
[44:20] part of their driveways. We want to stay
[44:22] off their lawns. And uh some u I think
[44:25] people maybe have accidentally not
[44:28] heated that. So, if we could in the
[44:30] future, please be careful, remember
[44:32] where you're parking, watch out, and uh
[44:35] we'd appreciate that very much.

[55:57] &gt;&gt; Angels weren't redeemed, but we've been
[55:59] redeemed."
[56:00] &gt;&gt; I tell you, anyone that's been redeemed
[56:04] ought to be able to say, "So,
[56:06] &gt;&gt; that's why we're alive. That's why we're
[56:08] here."

[56:53] you can say a word of prayer for Adam.
[56:56] He plans to he doesn't plan, but Uncle
[56:58] Sam plans for him to go to Iraq for some
[57:02] months. And uh we just hope that all

[59:09] in heaven.

[1:00:52] [Music]
[1:00:55] Praise the Lord. Isn't he wonderful?
[1:00:58] &gt;&gt; God's going to give us a good service.
[1:01:02] When little things like that happen,
[1:01:03] doesn't bother me. That's that I guess
[1:01:06] that's the missionary part. We just have
[1:01:08] so many things. Had lights go out, sit
[1:01:10] in the blackness, cold or whatever more.
[1:01:14] That doesn't make any difference.
[1:01:16] &gt;&gt; God's the same.
[1:01:18] &gt;&gt; We came here for a purpose
[1:01:20] &gt;&gt; and God's going to achieve his purpose.
[1:01:22] Amen.
[1:01:24] &gt;&gt; Welcome to the Dingwall family also
[1:01:26] officially. God bless you. I'll have you
[1:01:29] turn in your Bibles, please, to John's
[1:01:32] Gospel, the first chapter.
[1:01:36] And I don't know exactly how the service
[1:01:38] is,
[1:01:40] the message part is going to come, but
[1:01:44] I'm just looking for divine guidance
[1:01:46] right at this time.
[1:01:48] &gt;&gt; And I believe that God will give that to
[1:01:50] us.
[1:01:55] It's not so much a subject. I want to
[1:01:58] speak. I'm going to carry on, Lord
[1:01:59] willing, from last week,
[1:02:03] the mystery of God in the flesh.
[1:02:06] And this will be part two.
[1:02:09] So, it'll tie into last week. We'll
[1:02:11] start reading at verse one.
[1:02:14] In the beginning was the word, and the
[1:02:16] word was with God, and the word was God.
[1:02:20] The same was in the beginning with God.
[1:02:22] All things were made by him, and without
[1:02:24] him was not anything made that was made.
[1:02:28] In him was life, and the life was the
[1:02:30] light of man. And the light shineth in
[1:02:33] darkness, and the darkness comprehended
[1:02:36] it not.
[1:02:38] There was a man sent from God, whose
[1:02:40] name was John.
[1:02:42] The same came for a witness to bear
[1:02:45] witness of the light, that all men
[1:02:47] through him might believe. Notice, all
[1:02:49] men through him might believe.
[1:02:52] John was a witness to that light that
[1:02:55] all men through him might believe
[1:02:59] that he was not that light but was sent
[1:03:02] to bear witness of that light that was
[1:03:06] the true light which cometh which
[1:03:07] lightth every man that cometh into the
[1:03:09] world. He was in the world and the world
[1:03:13] was made by him and the world knew him
[1:03:16] not. He came unto his own, and his own
[1:03:19] received him not. But as many as
[1:03:21] received him, to them gave he power to
[1:03:24] become the sons of God, even to them
[1:03:26] that believe on his name, which were
[1:03:29] born not of blood, nor of the will of
[1:03:32] the flesh, nor of the will of man, but
[1:03:34] of God. And the word was made flesh and
[1:03:39] dwelt among us. And we beheld his glory,
[1:03:42] the glory as the only begotten of the
[1:03:45] father, full of grace and truth. Amen.
[1:03:49] How wonderful.
[1:03:50] &gt;&gt; Let's just ask God's blessing.
[1:03:53] Father, we ask your blessing upon our
[1:03:55] gathering and upon the gathering of the
[1:03:58] invisible internet congregation as well.
[1:04:02] wherever they may be gathered, gathered
[1:04:04] together with us now at this moment. And
[1:04:07] we feel, oh Lord, the impulse of the
[1:04:11] Holy Spirit. This is a sacred time when
[1:04:14] your people gather. We've gathered here
[1:04:17] because we hunger and thirst after
[1:04:20] righteousness. We have gathered here
[1:04:23] because we anticipate a resurrection.
[1:04:26] We've gathered here because we expect,
[1:04:29] we're in full expectation of the change
[1:04:32] of the body and the rapture of the
[1:04:35] church and the catching away of the
[1:04:38] believing saints of God. We believe that
[1:04:41] there's a great host that's just a
[1:04:43] breath away. We believe that there's
[1:04:46] angels at this moment at their stations
[1:04:49] in this sanctuary and elsewhere, Lord,
[1:04:52] throughout the world where your people
[1:04:54] are gathering. We believe, Father, that
[1:04:57] we are a group of people individually
[1:05:00] and corporately that are held in your
[1:05:03] hand and that no man can take us out of
[1:05:06] that place. How we love the security, oh
[1:05:10] God, that we sense this morning. Bless
[1:05:13] the congregation that is here, Father.
[1:05:16] And I pray that you will give utterance,
[1:05:18] Lord. And may when my mouth opens, let
[1:05:21] it not be human breath as it were, but
[1:05:24] may the words be the breath of God to
[1:05:27] the people I pray. And Father, cause us
[1:05:30] to think, cause us to ponder deeply.
[1:05:34] Cause us to be stirred. And if there's
[1:05:36] any portion of any heart that's present
[1:05:39] that is not fully surrendered, may it be
[1:05:42] cut loose by the Holy Spirit. and may
[1:05:46] the world disappear and pale off into
[1:05:49] the invisible become just an unessential
[1:05:53] part of our lives. Lord, as we give
[1:05:55] ourselves to you and prepare our little
[1:05:58] sister that'll be baptized right after
[1:06:00] the preaching of the word, we ask all of
[1:06:03] these things and we surrender ourselves,
[1:06:06] yield ourselves holy to the Holy Spirit
[1:06:10] at this moment in the name of Jesus
[1:06:12] Christ and for the glory of God alone.
[1:06:15] Amen.
[1:06:16] &gt;&gt; Amen. You may be seated.
[1:06:28] I I'd like to pose
[1:06:31] some questions
[1:06:33] uh right at the beginning of the service
[1:06:37] to kind of get your thoughts moving in a
[1:06:40] direction.
[1:06:44] Generally when I'm speaking and taking a
[1:06:46] a subject as thorough as I'd like to
[1:06:48] take it this morning I like to start and
[1:06:51] build a big foundation and then come
[1:06:55] with what is really the core core
[1:06:58] thought. But uh today I want to just
[1:07:02] take a quantum leap into the message and
[1:07:06] say you know here's kind of the
[1:07:07] direction I've been pondering in my own
[1:07:10] mind and I want to get you thinking
[1:07:13] about these things as well.
[1:07:16] In the scripture which we read we
[1:07:18] concluded with the verse and the word
[1:07:21] was made flesh and dwelt among us and we
[1:07:26] beheld his glory. John did John's
[1:07:29] writing of his own experience. He did
[1:07:32] see Christ in the flesh. He saw him,
[1:07:36] shall I say, in his first coming
[1:07:39] and uh
[1:07:42] experience part of that cycle of his
[1:07:45] first coming.
[1:07:48] Uh
[1:07:50] individually as an individual, it would
[1:07:54] have had some depth and meaning to him.
[1:07:57] And corporately, corporately as a body
[1:08:01] of believers where there were disciples
[1:08:04] and others,
[1:08:06] uh it was having a certain effect on
[1:08:08] them. And I suppose as it is today,
[1:08:11] it was having a a different effect on
[1:08:15] different individuals.
[1:08:17] Some were very gripped by what was
[1:08:19] happening. Some were completely consumed
[1:08:22] by what was happening. They were so
[1:08:25] consumed that the everything they were
[1:08:27] engaged in whether it was fishing and
[1:08:29] family or whatever more became like
[1:08:32] obsolete to them and they became
[1:08:35] completely consumed with what was they
[1:08:38] were engaged in and what was transpiring
[1:08:41] and what was happening and they were
[1:08:43] hearing for the first time scriptures
[1:08:45] from the Old Testament brought forward
[1:08:47] and and being applied to that very
[1:08:50] moment and thought well I've never
[1:08:52] connected that before and that was that
[1:08:54] was continued. Jesus was bringing them
[1:08:57] and and so so they were caught in some
[1:09:00] kind of a cycle and I'm I'm sure they
[1:09:03] asked themselves a question I've asked
[1:09:06] myself and I'm asking my question again
[1:09:10] with you today.
[1:09:12] Where are we in the cycle of his second
[1:09:15] coming?
[1:09:17] the world, they're all caught up in
[1:09:19] their thing which is they are calling
[1:09:21] Christmas and we know that uh
[1:09:26] the world at large is missing it. We
[1:09:28] don't want to miss it.
[1:09:30] &gt;&gt; We don't want to miss what God is doing.
[1:09:32] So my question is how far along
[1:09:37] has the message moved us into the cycle
[1:09:40] of his coming?
[1:09:43] How many scriptures
[1:09:46] have been fulfilled and are being
[1:09:48] fulfilled
[1:09:50] that pertain to the second coming? How
[1:09:53] many scriptures have been fulfilled
[1:09:55] while we are sitting here? While we've
[1:09:58] been attending church,
[1:10:00] &gt;&gt; while we've been declaring that we are
[1:10:04] believers,
[1:10:06] how many scriptures have been fulfilled?
[1:10:10] And uh
[1:10:13] how many are going to miss it?
[1:10:17] Brother Brandham says something here and
[1:10:20] then I'm going to take it to another
[1:10:22] stage
[1:10:26] in Christ the mystery of God revealed.
[1:10:28] He says, "Now the coming of the Lord is
[1:10:30] in mystery.
[1:10:33] It's in mystery." He said, uh, we don't
[1:10:37] know when he's coming, how he's coming,
[1:10:42] but we know he's coming.
[1:10:45] And so was all the mysteries of God
[1:10:47] waiting for the last day. All the
[1:10:50] mysteries of God, including this one,
[1:10:52] was waiting for the last day.
[1:10:55] Then he says a very interesting
[1:10:57] statement. after it's already been
[1:11:00] completed. Then
[1:11:03] he reveals he shows what he's done. He
[1:11:08] said, "Oh my, never give never gave his
[1:11:12] full mystery."
[1:11:15] Now he just hold that. Then he goes on
[1:11:18] to kind of explain that by saying, "Now
[1:11:21] it's just like this comparing the seven
[1:11:24] seals."
[1:11:26] Now he said when God used Martin Luther
[1:11:30] for the coming out for the first church
[1:11:34] in the reformation when God used Martin
[1:11:36] Luther for the coming out of the first
[1:11:40] of that church age and when he used John
[1:11:43] Wesley he gradually brought them out and
[1:11:48] was revealing and here's the phrase was
[1:11:50] revealing in them
[1:11:54] was revealing in Martin Luther and was
[1:11:58] revealing in John Wesley the church age
[1:12:02] was revealing the whole age the intent
[1:12:06] and the purpose was revealing in them
[1:12:10] that age he says and when we anyone goes
[1:12:14] back through the Bible now and find out
[1:12:18] and then he breaks it and then just says
[1:12:20] but in the last days and then he just
[1:12:22] breaks it once again and he he says is
[1:12:25] the reason that it was such a tremendous
[1:12:27] thing that he spoke here and showed in
[1:12:29] those seven thunders. And he goes on to
[1:12:32] the picture in the cloud picture which
[1:12:34] was on the screen earlier that brother
[1:12:37] Rod and brother Jeremy and the brothers
[1:12:39] have been working on. Uh you know
[1:12:44] uh these things are not really new or
[1:12:47] strange to us.
[1:12:49] uh we know a lot of the details
[1:12:52] but now I guess my question that I'm
[1:12:56] pondering in my own mind and I don't
[1:12:58] expect to come out with any you know
[1:13:01] profound things necessarily but I
[1:13:05] thought that that I would take and seize
[1:13:07] upon this Christmas season while the
[1:13:09] world is remembering and know nothing
[1:13:12] about his first coming celebrating and
[1:13:15] spending billions of dollars on on their
[1:13:18] parties and whatever more all just one
[1:13:21] big wild celebration about something
[1:13:24] they know nothing about and that's
[1:13:27] remembering his first coming and that's
[1:13:29] what it's degraded to and the Jews don't
[1:13:32] believe that he has come and the
[1:13:34] Gentiles who do and whatever more and
[1:13:37] whatever station the various peoples of
[1:13:40] the earth whether they're Muslims or
[1:13:42] Hindus or Buddhists or Christians or
[1:13:44] Jews or whatever it is they all got
[1:13:47] their different concept But that doesn't
[1:13:49] change that doesn't change one thing of
[1:13:51] God's word.
[1:13:53] &gt;&gt; God's word is right on track.
[1:13:56] &gt;&gt; And I I will say that we can be a very
[1:13:58] confident people. not proud but
[1:14:01] confident people because as you saw that
[1:14:05] little clip even of uh I thought how
[1:14:07] appropriate this morning that little
[1:14:09] clip of the of the pillar of fire and
[1:14:11] the confirmation of this hour and then
[1:14:14] to see that messenger stand in front of
[1:14:16] the people and to believe the sign to
[1:14:19] believe the sign. What happens to a
[1:14:21] people if they do believe the sign? I
[1:14:24] wonder in the when Jesus was on earth
[1:14:28] and beginning to move about the people
[1:14:30] and the Bible says they marvel at the
[1:14:33] glorious words that fell from his lips.
[1:14:36] I wonder because I try to put myself
[1:14:38] back there so I can project myself to
[1:14:41] where I am now. If I was back there,
[1:14:43] what what would I have thought at the
[1:14:46] these are marvelous words. Who is this?
[1:14:49] And then the revelation comes. This is
[1:14:51] the Christ. this is the Messiah and
[1:14:54] you're moving along in in the daytoday
[1:14:57] activity and the day-to-day things and
[1:15:00] you're seeing the various supernatural
[1:15:02] and the miracles and you have, you know,
[1:15:05] a number right here sitting in the
[1:15:07] congregation today that were up on the
[1:15:09] screen. No less supernatural. Every bit
[1:15:12] is marvelous. The same Jesus Christ
[1:15:14] yesterday and today and forever. And
[1:15:18] it's the same Jesus Christ who sent this
[1:15:20] messenger with this kind of a message
[1:15:23] veiled himself in it in that messenger
[1:15:25] and spoke out concerning the events that
[1:15:28] are taking place. And my question is
[1:15:30] just how far are we
[1:15:33] &gt;&gt; in that cycle. I don't want to be one I
[1:15:36] don't want to be one that turns around
[1:15:39] looks back and says, "Do you know what?
[1:15:41] a resurrection's happened
[1:15:43] &gt;&gt; and I I I wasn't moved by the things
[1:15:46] before and this somehow this isn't
[1:15:48] moving me. Oh God, stir me. I don't want
[1:15:50] to I don't want to ask for a stir then.
[1:15:53] I want to be stirred now.
[1:15:55] I want to be upfront now. I want to be
[1:15:58] passionate about this now. I want to be
[1:16:01] engaged. I want to be uh as close as I
[1:16:05] know how to be to God at this time.
[1:16:11] Amen.
[1:16:17] &gt;&gt; God works out his will and purpose
[1:16:21] in us as individuals
[1:16:26] and he also works out his purpose in us
[1:16:30] in a corporate form.
[1:16:33] So when we can say that the coming of
[1:16:37] the Holy Spirit or the coming of the
[1:16:40] manifestation of God
[1:16:42] uh in a certain in a certain time
[1:16:45] remember if you'll remember this and you
[1:16:48] have to excuse me I I I pray that God
[1:16:50] will uh help me to be very very clear
[1:16:54] but God can bring one person into a into
[1:16:58] a church a into a whole season of time.
[1:17:03] He can move in one person. And as far as
[1:17:06] God is concerned, he has achieved a
[1:17:08] certain objective by even bringing that
[1:17:11] in. In other words, here we are a whole
[1:17:13] body of people and God could raise up
[1:17:16] one person, one individual, do a certain
[1:17:19] thing, maybe fulfill a certain scripture
[1:17:22] and yet God would consider that the
[1:17:24] whole corporate body has moved to that
[1:17:27] place.
[1:17:28] &gt;&gt; You following me? So when God when God
[1:17:31] in Luther
[1:17:33] &gt;&gt; was breaking forth the church age, the
[1:17:36] whole church age had arrived.
[1:17:39] &gt;&gt; Every individual in the whole country
[1:17:41] were not was not experiencing what
[1:17:43] Luther was experiencing. But God had
[1:17:45] brought that scripture for that season
[1:17:48] to that moment.
[1:17:51] &gt;&gt; And then he did it in Wesley. And so and
[1:17:54] when and when brother Brandham came on
[1:17:56] the scene with that he may say a gift at
[1:18:00] one time another time we know that a a a
[1:18:03] prophet is is more than just a gift.
[1:18:06] It's not a gift of prophecy. They're
[1:18:08] born that way. Born so that that sign
[1:18:11] could be what it was be so visible. Then
[1:18:14] God considered the whole age to have
[1:18:17] arrived at that moment.
[1:18:20] &gt;&gt; You understand? And when the birth of
[1:18:23] Christ took place, a handful of
[1:18:25] shepherds heard about it, uh the wise
[1:18:28] men uh were attracted from two years
[1:18:31] distance away and traveling and the and
[1:18:34] the boy becomes a young lad. Uh by that
[1:18:37] time the world claims to be so smart and
[1:18:39] I find them very very ignorant. I find
[1:18:42] them unable to read the scripture and
[1:18:44] even understand a simple simple
[1:18:46] statement. And they got wise men in the
[1:18:48] in the store windows and everything else
[1:18:50] coming to the manger. They never came to
[1:18:52] the manger. No scripture said they ever
[1:18:54] came to a manger. So they came to a
[1:18:56] child, a young child, probably two years
[1:18:59] old by that time. Why can't they even
[1:19:01] get those simple things straight? If
[1:19:03] they can't get that straight, don't
[1:19:04] trust your soul to them.
[1:19:08] &gt;&gt; They came to the young child. But God,
[1:19:11] even so there was just a few some three
[1:19:13] wise men, a few shepherds and and and
[1:19:16] and
[1:19:18] Simeon and and Mary and Joseph, just a
[1:19:22] handful of people in the entire
[1:19:26] population of of the earth. Let me say
[1:19:30] this right and I want you to get it
[1:19:31] right. Just a handful of people of the
[1:19:34] entire population of the earth. I will
[1:19:37] say corporately that was the human human
[1:19:41] family
[1:19:42] &gt;&gt; corporately but individually there was
[1:19:45] only a handful that actually knew what
[1:19:49] was happening but in God's mind the
[1:19:52] entire world had moved to that station
[1:19:59] &gt;&gt; when William Brham came on the scene.
[1:20:01] And I use his name because he was the
[1:20:04] man that God used in this very unusual
[1:20:08] way. When he came on the scene, I am
[1:20:11] asking you, I'm asking God, I'm asking
[1:20:14] my own heart, where does God regard us
[1:20:18] as a whole corporate, we say Christian
[1:20:21] community, where did God regard us? At
[1:20:25] what station are we in the scriptures?
[1:20:29] And at what place are we as people who
[1:20:32] believe and know the opening of the
[1:20:34] word? Where are we in his coming?
[1:20:39] &gt;&gt; The resurrection has not happened
[1:20:44] to my knowledge.
[1:20:46] And brother Brandham says in one place
[1:20:48] after
[1:20:50] it's already been completed.
[1:20:53] You and I are not here to be people who
[1:20:57] recognize this event after.
[1:21:00] &gt;&gt; Now I believe brother Brandham is saying
[1:21:02] that to show to us that most of these
[1:21:05] important events are recognized after
[1:21:09] they happen trying to tell us don't be
[1:21:12] that group.
[1:21:15] &gt;&gt; We have no reason to be that group. We
[1:21:18] have no excuse to be that group because
[1:21:22] you have be been informed. I am
[1:21:25] informed.
[1:21:28] &gt;&gt; Are you informed?
[1:21:33] &gt;&gt; In the Sardisian church age, he said,
[1:21:37] "And Christ died.
[1:21:39] He gave his life.
[1:21:42] that life was to come back upon the
[1:21:44] church and bring many sons like unto
[1:21:47] himself unto glory in the resurrection.
[1:21:51] But as the wheat as the wheat seed had
[1:21:55] to have a carrier to bring forth
[1:21:58] multiplied wheat seed even so there had
[1:22:02] to be a church that would
[1:22:06] be the carrier of the life.
[1:22:10] God help me now.
[1:22:12] Be a carrier of the life of Christ as
[1:22:15] the blade, the stalk, the tossel, and
[1:22:18] the husks were the carrier for the seed,
[1:22:21] not the seed itself. So the church, the
[1:22:25] church age as it's moved on, the
[1:22:28] Christian community at large and the
[1:22:31] multitudes that are probably pounding
[1:22:34] their the floors of the mall at this
[1:22:37] moment trying to get their last gift or
[1:22:39] whatever more or or sitting in in in
[1:22:42] some church and singing these same
[1:22:45] carols that you sang and rejoicing in
[1:22:48] the fact that Christ came, but yet their
[1:22:51] leaders and their people and the
[1:22:53] Christian community officially, rejected
[1:22:56] and spoke reproachfully against this
[1:23:00] message, against the very doctrine that
[1:23:03] God was trying to and against the truth
[1:23:06] that that would move a people into an
[1:23:08] expectation such as we are.
[1:23:12] &gt;&gt; We're not saying, oh, you know, the Lord
[1:23:14] is coming. The Lord is coming. It's way
[1:23:16] beyond that.
[1:23:18] He is presently here in another realm.
[1:23:22] And we had a messenger who who who
[1:23:25] transcended back and forth that
[1:23:27] dimension of of the un invisible to the
[1:23:31] visible back and forth. You people had
[1:23:34] that. You people have had that sign
[1:23:36] because God has considered us as a
[1:23:39] corporate body to have arrived at that
[1:23:41] point when he did it within the body in
[1:23:43] one person.
[1:23:48] &gt;&gt; We've already arrived at that station.
[1:23:50] We're not waiting for that station.
[1:23:53] &gt;&gt; It's already happened. We're saying,
[1:23:55] "Well, it didn't happen to me." It
[1:23:56] wasn't given to you as an individual,
[1:23:59] but it was given to us corporately.
[1:24:02] &gt;&gt; Everything that the disciples, the
[1:24:04] disciples walked with the Lord, they
[1:24:06] didn't turn the water into the wine.
[1:24:08] They didn't multiply the bread and the
[1:24:10] fishes, but they were identified with
[1:24:12] it.
[1:24:13] &gt;&gt; They had arrived at that station.
[1:24:16] &gt;&gt; Are you following me?
[1:24:18] &gt;&gt; They were there. I'm here to announce to
[1:24:21] you as a group of people, you've arrived
[1:24:23] there.
[1:24:26] &gt;&gt; Well, I haven't seen visions. It wasn't
[1:24:28] given to you, but we have corporately
[1:24:30] arrived there.
[1:24:35] &gt;&gt; The secrets of the hearts of men.
[1:24:38] We aren't doing it. You're not doing it.
[1:24:41] I'm not. We don't have to do it. God has
[1:24:43] regarded that this that this corporate
[1:24:46] body of believers have arrived there and
[1:24:50] passed that.
[1:24:52] &gt;&gt; We've gone beyond the physical seeing a
[1:24:56] sign in the hand. We've gone beyond the
[1:24:59] revealing of the secrets of the heart of
[1:25:01] the people. We've gone beyond even the
[1:25:04] preaching and the opening of the word.
[1:25:06] Not that the word isn't to be preached,
[1:25:07] don't get me wrong, but he is the the
[1:25:09] the waiting for the mysteries of God. We
[1:25:13] don't have to try to contrive and figure
[1:25:16] out what the mysteries are. I just say,
[1:25:19] God, you have done it.
[1:25:22] &gt;&gt; You know what our big task is?
[1:25:25] And there's another there's another
[1:25:28] place
[1:25:31] uh
[1:25:34] uh
[1:25:36] I don't want it to be a negative on you
[1:25:38] but I want I want it you to think about
[1:25:40] it in connection with what I'm saying.
[1:25:42] It's in the same message Christ the
[1:25:44] mystery of God revealed.
[1:25:46] He said why do you hunger
[1:25:51] church? Why do you hunger?
[1:25:54] And why do you thirst?
[1:25:57] It's the father.
[1:26:00] So I speak to any that are here today
[1:26:03] that have a hunger
[1:26:05] and you have a thirst.
[1:26:08] You crave
[1:26:11] for spiritual things.
[1:26:14] You might think it's well it's just you
[1:26:16] or just some place you are in your life
[1:26:18] or just some events that have been
[1:26:19] happening that have put you into that
[1:26:21] kind of feeling that attitude that
[1:26:23] atmosphere. A prophet has come now to
[1:26:26] tell you listen to every person.
[1:26:29] He said it's the father.
[1:26:34] Oh, if we could only absorb that this
[1:26:36] moment. It's not just you. It's not
[1:26:40] something that's happened that's made
[1:26:42] you feel melancholy or made you feel
[1:26:44] emotional or made you feel good or made
[1:26:47] you feel bad. Has nothing to do with
[1:26:48] that. If you hunger and thirst after
[1:26:51] righteousness, it's the father.
[1:26:55] &gt;&gt; He said it's the father. And the father,
[1:26:58] it's not just the father, but he said
[1:26:59] the father is trying
[1:27:03] trying to reveal his hidden secret to
[1:27:06] you. And what was the secret that
[1:27:09] brother Brandon was talking about that
[1:27:11] was in the back part of God's mind that
[1:27:13] God wanted to reveal himself. He wanted
[1:27:16] to make himself known.
[1:27:19] &gt;&gt; He wanted to materialize himself.
[1:27:22] &gt;&gt; He wanted to become tangible.
[1:27:29] &gt;&gt; And he wanted it in his family. He said,
[1:27:31] "Is it trying to reveal his hidden
[1:27:34] secret to you?"
[1:27:37] And I search hard. This morning I was
[1:27:40] almost in a panic because I was trying
[1:27:42] to find this exact
[1:27:46] quote, this paragraph,
[1:27:48] these words
[1:27:50] because this is what was reverberating
[1:27:52] within me. But you let it you let you
[1:27:56] let it get you let them take it out of
[1:27:58] you. You let Satan take it out of you. I
[1:28:00] knew that he was saying something. You
[1:28:02] let something take it out of you. And he
[1:28:05] says, "But you let so many things
[1:28:08] get it out of you." And I thought, "Oh,
[1:28:11] God.
[1:28:13] Here we are with the hunger. Here we are
[1:28:16] with the thirst. Here we are in the
[1:28:18] second coming of Christ. Here we are
[1:28:20] with the scriptures being unfolded and
[1:28:22] fulfilled so rapidly. And I've got to
[1:28:25] stand before the people. And I know that
[1:28:28] they've come with this hunger and this
[1:28:30] thirst. This is not merely it's some
[1:28:32] celebration. And you may have come here
[1:28:34] because it's a special Christmas season.
[1:28:36] Let me tell you, you're here because God
[1:28:39] ordained that you're here.
[1:28:40] &gt;&gt; You're here because God ordained you
[1:28:43] want to hear this service. You need to
[1:28:45] hear this service. You're here because
[1:28:46] there's something within your heart that
[1:28:48] that has a hunger for God. And maybe the
[1:28:51] hunger needs to be uh needs to be
[1:28:53] increased. Maybe the Holy Spirit needs
[1:28:56] to really get a hold of it and and give
[1:28:59] you such a thirst for God. You'll get a
[1:29:01] passion. You'll get a hunger knowing
[1:29:04] this message is unfolding. And I've got
[1:29:07] to be there. I've got to be upfront. I
[1:29:09] got to be front center. I've got to
[1:29:11] receive everything. I I resolve within
[1:29:14] myself. I shall not be one that now
[1:29:16] looks back
[1:29:19] &gt;&gt; and says, "Wasn't Elijah supposed to
[1:29:21] come? Wasn't he even said they'll look
[1:29:23] back and say, "Wasn't there supposed to
[1:29:25] be a rapture?"
[1:29:27] &gt;&gt; Oh, God.
[1:29:29] &gt;&gt; This is truth, friends.
[1:29:31] &gt;&gt; This is truth. Throughout this
[1:29:33] congregation and those on the internet,
[1:29:35] resolve within your heart before God. I
[1:29:38] will not be one that stands on the other
[1:29:41] side looking back saying, "Wasn't there
[1:29:43] supposed to be a rapture?"
[1:29:50] If
[1:29:50] &gt;&gt; you want to give yourself a gift,
[1:29:54] make that promise
[1:29:56] to your own self
[1:29:58] before God in this body of witnesses. I
[1:30:03] shall not be one that looks back. Satan,
[1:30:07] wasn't there supposed to be?
[1:30:13] And he said, you let so many things get
[1:30:16] it out of you. You have it,
[1:30:19] &gt;&gt; but now he's going to identify some
[1:30:21] things that you allow
[1:30:25] &gt;&gt; to get that out of you.
[1:30:28] &gt;&gt; You have it. You possess it. It is
[1:30:30] yours.
[1:30:33] &gt;&gt; The father speaking to you. The father
[1:30:35] trying to perhaps reveal exactly where
[1:30:38] we are. But you allow things to get it
[1:30:41] out of you. And he names them.
[1:30:46] Your job,
[1:30:50] your wife.
[1:30:55] I speak to the wives.
[1:31:01] You wouldn't for a moment want to be an
[1:31:03] instrument of the world.
[1:31:07] that in opposition to Almighty God, the
[1:31:10] father
[1:31:12] trying to make himself known and reveal
[1:31:15] himself
[1:31:17] to your beloved husband. You wouldn't
[1:31:19] want to be one. Well, I'm a believer.
[1:31:24] I love this. But, you know, it's just
[1:31:27] the things of life. And you can engage
[1:31:30] your
[1:31:32] husband in the home and become
[1:31:35] so
[1:31:36] immersed in just life itself. And he
[1:31:40] doesn't stop there.
[1:31:42] And let your husband
[1:31:44] husbands
[1:31:48] you might be saying, "Brother Biscll,
[1:31:50] this is the last kind of message we
[1:31:52] expected
[1:31:54] for a Christmas message. This is my
[1:31:56] Christmas message.
[1:32:00] Husbands,
[1:32:01] you wouldn't would you want to create an
[1:32:03] atmosphere? When the prophet told us
[1:32:06] what kind of atmosphere you're creators,
[1:32:08] you can actually create an atmosphere in
[1:32:10] the home that brings the presence of God
[1:32:14] into the home.
[1:32:16] husbands,
[1:32:18] spiritual leaders, priests,
[1:32:24] the example
[1:32:26] to set the example.
[1:32:29] Many times I feel I set a poor example
[1:32:32] in the home even for my wife. But we are
[1:32:36] we have a charge
[1:32:39] &gt;&gt; and now it speaks he speaks of a husband
[1:32:43] or you let your children
[1:32:46] Parents can become so swallowed up in
[1:32:49] their child or their children or or what
[1:32:53] is involved with their children and and
[1:32:55] and so swallowed up and so swamped with
[1:32:59] their children and their activities and
[1:33:00] where they are and what they must do and
[1:33:02] all the rest of it that we allow we let
[1:33:05] that get it out of us. You have it,
[1:33:09] &gt;&gt; but that causes it to deteriorate,
[1:33:13] &gt;&gt; causes it to diminish within us. What we
[1:33:16] really need to do, you say, well, let
[1:33:18] let's let's move on from that. Well, I
[1:33:20] can't because it goes on to say, and the
[1:33:23] cares of this world, and this world is a
[1:33:25] world of cares.
[1:33:27] &gt;&gt; And I can say, we're not going to ever
[1:33:30] be done with the cares. We've got cares
[1:33:32] and cares and more cares and more
[1:33:34] concerns. And the more uh the more
[1:33:37] media, the more contact you can have
[1:33:40] with one another, the more you read and
[1:33:42] the more uh you see in a newspaper or
[1:33:45] see on the on your computer or
[1:33:48] television, I hope not, or hear on the
[1:33:51] radio and all of these things, then we
[1:33:53] we become so absorbed and so swallowed
[1:33:56] up and then I crash into our bed at
[1:33:58] night totally wearied and wore out by
[1:34:01] the cares of this life and just the
[1:34:03] burdens of this life. And I say this
[1:34:06] most important of all things here. God
[1:34:09] sends everything as brother Brown says
[1:34:11] on that message deep call to the deep.
[1:34:13] He says God sends his word. He sends his
[1:34:16] holy spirit. He sends his preachers. He
[1:34:18] sends his gifts. He sends his messenger.
[1:34:21] He sends his prophet. He sends his sign.
[1:34:24] He sends a pillar of fire. What more can
[1:34:26] he do?
[1:34:29] &gt;&gt; What more can he do to get our
[1:34:30] attention? Amen.
[1:34:32] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:34:33] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:34:34] &gt;&gt; We ought to be turning and saying, "God,
[1:34:37] you've done everything you can. I give
[1:34:39] myself. I take my I take time. I think
[1:34:43] about this. I'm going to turn my even in
[1:34:45] my job or even in my duties, I'm going
[1:34:48] to have my mind upon you. Going to be
[1:34:50] pondering things."
[1:34:55] &gt;&gt; Can we say amen?
[1:34:56] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[1:34:57] &gt;&gt; Even whatever you're engaged in, you
[1:34:59] don't have to allow there will be cares,
[1:35:02] but you you don't have to allow the
[1:35:04] cares to take it out of you.
[1:35:07] &gt;&gt; But while you're in the cares of this
[1:35:08] life, for we will have the cares of this
[1:35:10] life. Our mind is set upon God.
[1:35:14] &gt;&gt; Our mind is set upon where we're at. Our
[1:35:18] mind is set upon the fulfillment of the
[1:35:20] scriptures of the word of God. Amen.
[1:35:23] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:35:25] &gt;&gt; I'll just tell you privately
[1:35:27] often I and my wife, we sit in silence
[1:35:31] and we'll eat in a lot of silence and
[1:35:33] even I'm conscious I should be saying
[1:35:35] something but I haven't got a lot to say
[1:35:39] because my mind is so absorbed and so
[1:35:42] caught up and I'll just be thinking
[1:35:44] about one phrase but you let the world
[1:35:47] you let so many things get it out of
[1:35:48] you. And I'm sitting there eating at the
[1:35:51] breakfast table or sitting there last
[1:35:53] night and I tell you, but you let so
[1:35:55] many things get it out of you. Get it
[1:35:56] out of you. Oh God. Oh God.
[1:36:00] What is it that you're wanting to say to
[1:36:02] us?
[1:36:03] &gt;&gt; We're not going to completely eradically
[1:36:05] radically change our lifestyle. We are
[1:36:07] here. This is the age we're in. This is
[1:36:10] a this is the real world, friends.
[1:36:13] You're not going to change. You're not
[1:36:14] going to change the whole society.
[1:36:16] You're not going to change civilization.
[1:36:18] And we're not interested in we're
[1:36:19] interested in one thing in in this
[1:36:21] individual yourself. Number one, moving
[1:36:25] in the direction that God would have you
[1:36:27] move and affecting anyone you can
[1:36:30] affect, influencing whoever you can
[1:36:32] influence. But keep moving in that
[1:36:34] direction with a determination that no
[1:36:37] devil in hell can break.
[1:36:43] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:36:46] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:36:51] said, "So the
[1:36:53] scripture says, "And she brought forth
[1:36:55] her firstborn,
[1:36:58] her firstborn son, and wrapped him in
[1:37:00] swaddling clothes and laid him in a
[1:37:02] manger because there was no room for him
[1:37:05] in the end."
[1:37:11] She
[1:37:14] she was a long time coming.
[1:37:17] this one Mary,
[1:37:21] this virgin
[1:37:25] and the one that she was bringing
[1:37:31] was a long time coming before the
[1:37:34] foundation of the world. And last Sunday
[1:37:37] I took a lot of time and I won't do that
[1:37:39] now. But while this earth was an old
[1:37:41] star spinning and created some gases and
[1:37:44] created some uh calcium and some pot ash
[1:37:48] and some elements and so on and the
[1:37:50] prophet says what was he doing? Ask the
[1:37:51] question he was making you
[1:37:55] &gt;&gt; to be here
[1:37:57] knowing that you would be lost.
[1:38:01] And at the same time when he was
[1:38:04] creating you, he was also putting the
[1:38:07] elements for a earth that he knew would
[1:38:11] become cursed.
[1:38:13] That he under his own decree would curse
[1:38:16] the earth and it would bring forth
[1:38:18] thistles and thorns and so on. He knew
[1:38:21] it would become cursed. And he knew in
[1:38:23] his mind that he's going to bring forth
[1:38:25] the elements of that. Oh, this is a
[1:38:28] Christmas story to me, friends. Amen.
[1:38:33] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:38:34] &gt;&gt; I I haven't got the time, but I would I
[1:38:37] would like to
[1:38:40] I would like to even have you read in
[1:38:44] your own time the genealogies
[1:38:48] of Joseph which are in Matthew. And it
[1:38:52] says in Matthew that Joseph was the son
[1:38:56] of
[1:38:58] was the son of uh Jacob.
[1:39:04] And Jacob begat Joseph, the husband of
[1:39:07] Mary. And if you take the genealogies in
[1:39:11] Luke, it says that Joseph was and the
[1:39:17] and the word son of is not in the Greek.
[1:39:21] It says simply that Joseph was of
[1:39:26] Heli
[1:39:27] and Heli obviously was not Joseph's
[1:39:31] father. It says in Matthew, "And Jacob
[1:39:34] begat Joseph."
[1:39:36] So there's not a contradiction. And I
[1:39:39] have another scripture which I haven't
[1:39:40] got time to go into, but it the
[1:39:43] scriptures also refer to a son-in-law as
[1:39:46] the son.
[1:39:48] And so now Jacob, Joseph had to be the
[1:39:51] son-in-law of Heli, which brings Mary,
[1:39:55] Mary directly into the lineage of David
[1:39:58] through Nathan.
[1:40:00] And it brings Joseph directly into the
[1:40:03] lineage. They were both directly out of
[1:40:05] the lineage of David. So that the one
[1:40:08] coming forth, Jesus, from Mary, could be
[1:40:11] called the son of David.
[1:40:15] &gt;&gt; Both of those lineages.
[1:40:17] Now that that is really striking because
[1:40:21] the reason it goes all the way back
[1:40:24] God,
[1:40:27] you know, they had wars and troubles and
[1:40:29] fightings and all kinds of things taking
[1:40:32] place and famines and bondage and and
[1:40:35] deliverances and on and on coming down.
[1:40:37] All God is seeing
[1:40:41] like a dual vision.
[1:40:43] He's singing one line coming down here
[1:40:46] all the way down. All the way down
[1:40:50] until a certain moment of time
[1:40:53] and she's just a girl. She's just 15
[1:40:56] years old
[1:40:58] and she comes and now she's in the
[1:41:00] world. God considers the whole world,
[1:41:04] the whole earth has moved to that
[1:41:07] junction of the first coming.
[1:41:11] Nobody knows about it. But God the
[1:41:14] creator has moved the whole the whole of
[1:41:17] humanity
[1:41:20] to that junction
[1:41:23] and conceived in the womb
[1:41:26] of that young girl by the Holy Spirit
[1:41:30] begins to form a body and she eats of
[1:41:33] the normal food of the wheat and
[1:41:35] whatever more. And what is God Almighty
[1:41:37] doing? He's the one that let the old
[1:41:40] star spin billions of years ago to bring
[1:41:43] some gases and pot ash and calcium and
[1:41:46] whatever more. And now he's drawing that
[1:41:48] right up through a body, the body of
[1:41:52] Mary the virgin. drawing that very food
[1:41:56] up into her body to form a body of
[1:41:59] cursed earth that he himself will dwell
[1:42:02] in and take control back of the earth
[1:42:05] and claim it back in a perfect
[1:42:07] redemption.
[1:42:11] &gt;&gt; Think of it. Think of it. He's taking
[1:42:14] and that's why the scripture says that
[1:42:16] Christ became a curse for us. He took of
[1:42:20] the cursed earth and dwelt in it and
[1:42:22] brought that earth under subjection to
[1:42:26] the Holy Spirit to the spirit of God
[1:42:28] that was in him. And and he didn't
[1:42:31] merely live that life for himself, but
[1:42:33] he said it's expedient for you that I go
[1:42:36] because when I go, then the spirit of
[1:42:38] God will come into you and you'll be
[1:42:42] like he's a son of God. You'll be sons
[1:42:45] of God. You'll be daughters of God.
[1:42:47] You'll be a God people.
[1:42:50] &gt;&gt; God will be in the flesh again. We've
[1:42:52] gone through this process. We're going
[1:42:54] through a process. And God took this
[1:42:57] process of trillions of years perhaps
[1:43:00] bringing up bringing up a body of the
[1:43:02] earth. And that's what's that's what
[1:43:04] Christmas is all about. Here's a body.
[1:43:07] And the word was made flesh and we
[1:43:10] beheld his glory as the only be of the
[1:43:14] only begotten of the father. He stood on
[1:43:16] the earth and it's not enough to
[1:43:18] remember that. It's not enough to
[1:43:20] celebrate that. The real celebration is
[1:43:22] that the that God came into our flesh.
[1:43:27] &gt;&gt; That's part of the process.
[1:43:32] &gt;&gt; And he would move. Now this uh it came
[1:43:36] from an individual. It became a
[1:43:38] corporate body and the church was born
[1:43:41] and the spirit of God came into the
[1:43:43] church.
[1:43:45] And now the church moves through its
[1:43:47] hundreds of years and 2,000 years and
[1:43:51] coming to the end after it's had a birth
[1:43:54] pain of the first world war and another
[1:43:56] birth pain of a second world war and man
[1:43:59] from eating from the tree of knowledge
[1:44:01] of good and evil has devised a means by
[1:44:05] which he can destroy himself and he can
[1:44:08] destroy the entire earth by his own
[1:44:11] knowledge
[1:44:12] and he's come to a critical place. And
[1:44:15] at that time, God comes and demonstrates
[1:44:18] a knowledge that man knows nothing
[1:44:20] about.
[1:44:21] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:44:22] &gt;&gt; In a human body stands there, a redeemed
[1:44:25] body, one born by sin, but one who's
[1:44:28] come to full maturity.
[1:44:31] [Applause]
[1:44:32] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:44:34] &gt;&gt; In fact is it had to be that Christ
[1:44:36] through him would wave a sheath over the
[1:44:39] people to declare there are more like
[1:44:42] that in the earth.
[1:44:48] God in the flesh.
[1:44:49] &gt;&gt; And people want to back away from it. If
[1:44:51] it's anything less than that, then you
[1:44:53] have to have a new definition.
[1:44:56] &gt;&gt; But the definition is it's God in the
[1:44:58] flesh. I in you and you in me. I in the
[1:45:02] father and the father in me. And it's
[1:45:05] that day and that is oneness.
[1:45:11] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:45:11] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:45:17] So he said the church really had birth
[1:45:19] pains. He said the church really is in
[1:45:21] birth pains tonight again for the
[1:45:24] deliverance of the son
[1:45:27] of God to come again.
[1:45:31] 65.
[1:45:33] All of our theologians,
[1:45:36] all of our symptoms, uh, systems, all of
[1:45:39] our denominations has rotted
[1:45:42] &gt;&gt; right out from under us.
[1:45:43] &gt;&gt; So, we are in birth pains.
[1:45:46] &gt;&gt; And a message from God always throws the
[1:45:49] church into heavier pains. The message
[1:45:53] through the church into heavier pains.
[1:45:56] I listened to a testimony last night
[1:45:59] of a couple that sits here in the
[1:46:01] service this morning and the birth pains
[1:46:04] and how they went on a search in another
[1:46:07] country on another continent. But how
[1:46:09] they went on a search and they searched
[1:46:11] here and they searched there and they
[1:46:12] tried this and they tried that and both
[1:46:14] of them Catholics, both of them died in
[1:46:17] the wool. Catholics, they knew it wasn't
[1:46:19] there and they're going on a search and
[1:46:22] it's just so amazing. You can just see
[1:46:25] how the conception takes place and God
[1:46:28] arranges it. They're just one person
[1:46:31] even got so close that they were
[1:46:33] fellowshipping in a group and the group
[1:46:35] would use the prophet's message but
[1:46:37] would absolutely refuse to tell them
[1:46:40] where they got those things.
[1:46:44] And finally
[1:46:46] one man
[1:46:48] out of all of them that they meet they
[1:46:50] bang here bang there you know bump into
[1:46:52] this one bump into that one go into this
[1:46:54] church into that movement into this one
[1:46:56] and then finally finally all there's one
[1:46:59] person
[1:47:01] says the right thing
[1:47:04] and then it all happens
[1:47:08] the church is in birth pains again
[1:47:10] heavier pains but after a while.
[1:47:14] &gt;&gt; Listen to this. After a while,
[1:47:16] &gt;&gt; but after a while, she's going to be
[1:47:19] delivered of a bride.
[1:47:21] &gt;&gt; And he doesn't stop there. After a
[1:47:23] while, she'll be delivered of a bride
[1:47:25] who the church will be delivered of a
[1:47:27] bride. In other words, God will consider
[1:47:30] the entire corporate church to have
[1:47:32] brought forth a bride because they were
[1:47:35] a carrier. They were only a carrier and
[1:47:38] they brought forth a bride. And but he
[1:47:40] doesn't end the he doesn't end the
[1:47:42] sentence there. He said brought
[1:47:44] delivered of a bride that'll bring forth
[1:47:47] Jesus Christ
[1:47:48] &gt;&gt; to his bride.
[1:47:51] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:47:56] &gt;&gt; Is it all right? Amen. Amen.
[1:48:02] &gt;&gt; This message
[1:48:05] was to forrun the second coming of Jesus
[1:48:07] Christ.
[1:48:09] And obviously, we're in that cycle.
[1:48:14] I said a moment ago, Satan will use
[1:48:16] every possible means he can to dull our
[1:48:19] expectations or to distract us with
[1:48:22] other things that seem more urgent, more
[1:48:25] demanding.
[1:48:27] taking our attention and seeking to
[1:48:30] fully occupy us. This we must resist.
[1:48:33] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:48:35] &gt;&gt; Do I have a a complete 100% union on
[1:48:38] that? This we must resist.
[1:48:41] &gt;&gt; We and I say in all truth. We can do our
[1:48:44] duties. We can do our studies. We can
[1:48:47] bear up under our responsibilities. And
[1:48:49] we can do all of that. I want to
[1:48:51] announce to you, you can do all of that
[1:48:53] without allowing it to take it out of
[1:48:55] you.
[1:48:57] It's the father.
[1:48:59] &gt;&gt; I want you to look inwardly right now.
[1:49:02] &gt;&gt; And ask yourself, do I have a real
[1:49:06] thirst and hunger for God? Something
[1:49:08] more than just a casual, well, yeah, I
[1:49:10] like, you know, I like going to church.
[1:49:12] That's not what I'm asking you. Yeah, I
[1:49:14] have my friends there. That's not what
[1:49:16] I'm asking. I'm asking you, do you have
[1:49:17] a thirst for God deep down after you
[1:49:20] pull everything else aside? So that
[1:49:22] thirst for God. Oh God, I as the heart
[1:49:27] panth after the waterbrooks so pneth my
[1:49:30] soul after you. After all of these
[1:49:34] things fade away and I push them all
[1:49:36] aside, there's a hunger. There's a
[1:49:39] craving for holiness, for justice, for
[1:49:43] truth,
[1:49:45] &gt;&gt; for holiness, purity. There's a hunger
[1:49:47] for it. If there's a hunger for it, I
[1:49:51] can announce to you from the message,
[1:49:54] it's the father.
[1:49:57] &gt;&gt; That's not just you. That's the father.
[1:50:01] &gt;&gt; And he's trying by that hunger to move
[1:50:04] you in the direction he wants you
[1:50:06] because he wants to reveal himself to
[1:50:09] you. That's the secret he had in the
[1:50:11] back part of his mind before the
[1:50:12] foundation of the world. I'm going to
[1:50:14] get a people. I'm going to create within
[1:50:16] them a certain appetite, a certain
[1:50:18] hunger, a thirst that nothing can
[1:50:21] satisfy.
[1:50:23] Nothing can satisfy. Material things can
[1:50:25] never satisfy it. Uh a a beautiful life
[1:50:28] can never satisfy it. Only I can satisfy
[1:50:32] it.
[1:50:33] [Applause]
[1:50:35] And Satan, my arch enemy, he's going to
[1:50:37] throw everything dazzling in front of
[1:50:39] them and he cares and worries and
[1:50:41] troubles and sorrows and and griefs and
[1:50:44] all kinds of things. I'll throw it all
[1:50:46] in front of them to try and get it out
[1:50:48] of them.
[1:50:50] &gt;&gt; But I have a little preacher
[1:50:52] that'll come on a Sunday morning or
[1:50:55] another preacher that'll come and alert
[1:50:57] them and and cause them to see it.
[1:51:00] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. I pray this. I've never
[1:51:03] prayed before. God, let let it be your
[1:51:06] breath that comes this morning over this
[1:51:08] pulpit. Your breath,
[1:51:12] &gt;&gt; which is the very inspiration of God.
[1:51:15] And let that breath be breathed into you
[1:51:17] so you can go out these doors and say, I
[1:51:20] can never be the same person again.
[1:51:23] [Applause]
[1:51:30] And the word was made flesh
[1:51:33] &gt;&gt; and dwelt among us
[1:51:36] in a body of earth
[1:51:38] cursed earth. The second Adam Jesus
[1:51:40] Christ standing on the earth for the
[1:51:45] purpose of reclaiming the earth.
[1:51:48] How beautiful.
[1:51:50] How beautiful.
[1:51:53] And the angel is commissioned prophet
[1:51:55] said what the first Adam lost the second
[1:51:58] Adam Christ restored again
[1:52:02] &gt;&gt; to the human race.
[1:52:04] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:52:05] &gt;&gt; Are you part of the human race?
[1:52:08] &gt;&gt; You believe that vindicated word? What
[1:52:11] Adam lost a second Adam has restored it
[1:52:14] back to the church to the human race.
[1:52:23] As I said a moment ago, not only was
[1:52:25] Jesus coming down,
[1:52:29] maybe not what not what the Jews
[1:52:31] anticipated.
[1:52:33] He's going to come down. The great red
[1:52:34] carpet's going to go on into the temple.
[1:52:38] I don't know what they anticipated. And
[1:52:41] I know
[1:52:43] speaking to you today, I know from my
[1:52:46] own experience, if we talk about the
[1:52:48] coming of Jesus Christ,
[1:52:50] we have some hundreds of people here,
[1:52:53] we've got all kinds of ideas
[1:52:55] &gt;&gt; about how it's going to be and how he's
[1:52:57] going to come and, you know, and and uh
[1:53:01] the word says cloud. So, some says it
[1:53:03] got to be a cloud and well, you know,
[1:53:06] scientifically we have all kinds of
[1:53:07] problems with that. It comes with the
[1:53:09] cloud here. What about the people on the
[1:53:10] other side of the earth and all kind?
[1:53:12] Well, is it going to be, you know, over
[1:53:14] a period of 24 hours or what's Oh my
[1:53:16] goodness. I tell you, a lot of this is
[1:53:19] fairy tales.
[1:53:21] &gt;&gt; A lot of it is just ideas that have
[1:53:22] drifted. We we we've uh we've got them
[1:53:27] by osmosis
[1:53:29] from the church world and the
[1:53:31] denominations and what people have said
[1:53:33] and what we've been taught and all kinds
[1:53:35] of things. Then God comes and begins to
[1:53:37] tell us that it's in a mystery. The
[1:53:40] coming's in a mystery and and and these
[1:53:42] are the things. And I'll tell you the
[1:53:43] prophet of God, he was very very clear.
[1:53:46] And yet it will always be a mystery to
[1:53:48] us. Do you know why? These human minds
[1:53:51] cannot grasp what God and how he's going
[1:53:54] to do things.
[1:53:58] &gt;&gt; I've thought about our bodies. The body
[1:54:00] that I'm going to step into and there's
[1:54:02] going to be destruction. You know what?
[1:54:04] You know what the prophet speaks about
[1:54:05] and I'm getting off my subject now but
[1:54:07] he speaks about the great tribulation
[1:54:09] and the things that are going to happen
[1:54:10] and then says you know we don't go any
[1:54:12] place and we're right here and and how
[1:54:14] are we going to do that? Well, you know
[1:54:15] how one way I'll just tell you that
[1:54:17] satisfies myself. You're going to be
[1:54:19] your body your body your theophony body
[1:54:22] is absolutely indestructible.
[1:54:26] &gt;&gt; You you you could stand in that body and
[1:54:28] have have a nuclear bomb land two inches
[1:54:31] from you. It wouldn't do a thing to you.
[1:54:33] Amen.
[1:54:34] &gt;&gt; Cuz one is material and one is of this
[1:54:37] world and one is of this civilization
[1:54:39] and you're in another civilization.
[1:54:41] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:54:43] &gt;&gt; We have a body like his glorious body.
[1:54:46] &gt;&gt; Go through that wall if I need to. You
[1:54:49] will, too.
[1:54:50] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. If you need to be in another
[1:54:52] place, you'll be there. That's not a
[1:54:54] pipe dream. That's the body that Christ
[1:54:56] had.
[1:54:58] &gt;&gt; And you'll have a body like under his
[1:55:00] glorious body. I'll have a body like his
[1:55:02] glorious body and there can be tumults
[1:55:04] and there can be destruction and there
[1:55:06] can be absolute uh uh just uh uh in
[1:55:10] incredible things happening destruction
[1:55:12] of every kind. It won't touch the
[1:55:14] believer.
[1:55:16] &gt;&gt; That body is from another creation and
[1:55:19] you already have that creation within
[1:55:21] you. You are a new creature in Christ
[1:55:24] Jesus. The scripture says so. Do you
[1:55:26] believe that?
[1:55:28] Jesus said, Jesus said, "That which is
[1:55:32] born of the flesh is what?"
[1:55:34] &gt;&gt; Flesh. Say it again.
[1:55:36] &gt;&gt; Flesh. But that which is born of the
[1:55:39] spirit.
[1:55:41] &gt;&gt; Is spirit.
[1:55:43] &gt;&gt; Didn't say spirit and flesh. It's
[1:55:45] spirit.
[1:55:47] &gt;&gt; We have a spiritual life, a spiritual
[1:55:49] body already growing inside.
[1:55:53] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And he's got a body like
[1:55:55] this one when it dropped out of our
[1:55:56] mother's womb. Here we were subject to
[1:56:00] the elements of this world. But we have
[1:56:02] another body. In fact, is the craving
[1:56:04] that's in you right now, the hunger
[1:56:07] that's in you right now caused me to
[1:56:09] come to this pulpit today because the
[1:56:11] prophet said it's your body on the other
[1:56:14] side crying out for this element.
[1:56:18] Hallelujah.
[1:56:20] &gt;&gt; If you don't like what you're hearing,
[1:56:22] you're the one that caused it.
[1:56:25] &gt;&gt; It's a medicine that God called for it
[1:56:27] to come.
[1:56:29] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:56:33] My
[1:56:39] &gt;&gt; so all of this if I could just have you
[1:56:42] to see in the corporate in the corporate
[1:56:46] structure
[1:56:48] God saw
[1:56:51] all through these church ages just
[1:56:53] coming down. I'm just going to take a
[1:56:54] moment to quickly
[1:56:58] try and dramatize it a wee bit.
[1:57:01] And now he came down into the church by
[1:57:04] the Holy Ghost. And the church is born.
[1:57:08] And the very life of Jesus now is in the
[1:57:11] earth corporately. And God is just
[1:57:14] watching that life,
[1:57:16] watching it coming down in the corporate
[1:57:18] body.
[1:57:20] And that corporate body moves down,
[1:57:23] moves into the ages of the martyrs. The
[1:57:27] life keeps going and the world is trying
[1:57:29] to extinguish it and the world is at
[1:57:31] great conflict with it. But the life
[1:57:33] keeps moving down. Then the age of the
[1:57:36] man come and darkness came and
[1:57:40] political movements and laws came into
[1:57:42] place and they made decrees and you
[1:57:45] can't have that Bible in your home. But
[1:57:47] the life kept moving through that
[1:57:48] darkness and God God and then and then
[1:57:51] the other side of that darkness it came
[1:57:53] to a certain season a certain time and
[1:57:55] God himself then he he reveals in
[1:57:59] revelation he puts it in a man and that
[1:58:01] man is Luther and now the whole of
[1:58:04] humanity is ri arrived to a certain
[1:58:07] junction and he begins to display in
[1:58:09] that man and the others begin to catch
[1:58:12] it the believers begin to catch the
[1:58:14] revelation moves on and then he gets
[1:58:16] comes into the age of of another age of
[1:58:19] justification moves on, steps into a man
[1:58:23] and begins to manifest in that
[1:58:25] individual what is taking place and
[1:58:27] where we are in time. And then comes the
[1:58:31] last age. He says the messenger always
[1:58:32] come at the end of the age had a great
[1:58:34] outpouring and gifts and manifestation
[1:58:36] and speaking in tongues and signs and
[1:58:38] wonders and supernatural things. Hadn't
[1:58:40] had anything like that uh for for
[1:58:43] centuries and centuries. Now we moved.
[1:58:45] Are you listening to me?
[1:58:46] Now we move to that time. See, it's like
[1:58:49] a little study. And we come to that
[1:58:51] time. Now it is a different season. It's
[1:58:55] not a reformer that's needed. Listen
[1:58:57] closely. Not a reformer could do it.
[1:59:00] It's got to be a a a God prophet.
[1:59:03] &gt;&gt; Not a a a prophet of God. It has to be
[1:59:06] that. And it has to be one who's who is
[1:59:09] the veil so that God can now bring it to
[1:59:12] a whole different a different junction a
[1:59:15] different kind. I might be misunderstood
[1:59:17] but I would say behind the skin of
[1:59:21] brother Brandham behind the skin God was
[1:59:24] hiding behind that skin. And when he
[1:59:27] opened his mouth God spoke out of his
[1:59:29] mouth
[1:59:31] and not through his eyes. It wasn't in
[1:59:33] his eyes. I've been closer than I am to
[1:59:35] this boy here when brother Brandham was
[1:59:38] having visions and looked over my head
[1:59:40] and told me exactly what was happening
[1:59:42] and what was wrong with people, what was
[1:59:44] taking place. And I looked at those
[1:59:47] eyes. I thought those eyes are not like
[1:59:49] a human's eyes that are looking darting
[1:59:51] around back and forth. He's looking into
[1:59:53] some other place, some other realm. God
[1:59:56] had a vessel that could look into
[1:59:58] eternity. Tell a woman what the doctor
[2:00:01] said. He could tell her, uh, I see the
[2:00:05] doctor's report something in in in the
[2:00:09] past and read that report to that woman.
[2:00:13] Now, that was just to that woman. Now,
[2:00:14] what about you and I? What about the
[2:00:16] report we need to hear? And where are we
[2:00:20] in this season? What kind of God would
[2:00:22] we have would send us this kind of
[2:00:24] ministry? Send us this kind of uh this
[2:00:27] kind of a voice. What kind of a God
[2:00:30] have you got that would leave the most
[2:00:33] important and the most significant thing
[2:00:35] and leave it all shrouded and covered
[2:00:37] and bring us to this time? But I can't
[2:00:39] tell you. I won't tell you. I'll leave
[2:00:42] you floundering around. That's not the
[2:00:44] God we have.
[2:00:47] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:00:49] &gt;&gt; I don't know what this is meaning to
[2:00:50] you, but it means a whole lot to me.
[2:00:53] &gt;&gt; And I'm not going to be too much longer.
[2:00:56] I don't want to wear you out, but I all
[2:00:58] I can tell you friends, I I'm just on
[2:01:00] page two.
[2:01:04] I have a lot in my heart.
[2:01:08] And it centers on that one theme. Where
[2:01:11] are you? Where am I? Where are we?
[2:01:16] And for me to even think that I can come
[2:01:18] here
[2:01:20] and you'd be
[2:01:24] I would hate to think that you would
[2:01:26] allow other things to crowd in and you
[2:01:27] to be be distracted at this incredible
[2:01:30] moment.
[2:01:33] I won't preach this again next Christmas
[2:01:36] if we're still here.
[2:01:49] I'm not worried and I'm not trying to
[2:01:50] think what I'm going to say. I'm just
[2:01:53] watching.
[2:01:54] The Bible starts out and the first time
[2:01:58] image appears in the Bible is in Genesis
[2:02:03] 1 and 26.
[2:02:05] Let us make man in our image.
[2:02:10] And the next verse mentions it about
[2:02:12] three times.
[2:02:16] When you come to the book of Revelation,
[2:02:20] there's not one time that image refers
[2:02:22] to God.
[2:02:24] Every single time it is the image of the
[2:02:27] beast, the image to the beast, the image
[2:02:31] of the beast, the beast's image. And
[2:02:35] every time 10 times the word image
[2:02:40] appears in the book of Revelation. And
[2:02:43] every time it refers to the image of the
[2:02:46] beast
[2:02:50] from the image that God had standing on
[2:02:53] the earth. Now I'm going to I've got to
[2:02:55] consummate my message pretty quickly.
[2:02:58] From the time God said, "Let us make
[2:03:00] man." And he made man. And a God man
[2:03:03] stood on the earth in the image of God
[2:03:06] made he him
[2:03:09] and God life in him. And then the fall
[2:03:14] and then the prophet says and I had a I
[2:03:17] had to look for this one too. Said God
[2:03:20] wasn't willing to leave his masterpiece
[2:03:23] lay down in the dust.
[2:03:26] He wasn't willing to leave his his
[2:03:28] image, his masterpiece lay broken down
[2:03:32] in the dust. But he be quickly to build
[2:03:35] up again another masterpiece.
[2:03:38] &gt;&gt; And that is what from Adam's time. Oh, I
[2:03:42] wish I had a big platform. I'd
[2:03:43] demonstrate it. from Adam's time here.
[2:03:46] God on all God of the universe, but he's
[2:03:50] got his focus on a a little speck of
[2:03:52] dust called the earth cuz it's the womb
[2:03:55] for his life. And in that amongst that,
[2:03:58] he's got some little creatures that are
[2:04:00] crawling. But the great God from the
[2:04:02] back part of his mind wanted to
[2:04:04] manifest. He wanted to show himself. He
[2:04:06] wanted to become tangible.
[2:04:08] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:04:10] &gt;&gt; He wanted to materialize
[2:04:12] himself. He wanted a family.
[2:04:16] &gt;&gt; Where's the house that you build me?
[2:04:18] Where's the household? He speaks to
[2:04:19] Isaiah. Where is my household? Where's
[2:04:22] my children?
[2:04:26] &gt;&gt; Says the earth is my foottool. The
[2:04:27] heavens, my hands have made, but where
[2:04:30] is my family? Where's my household?
[2:04:32] Where do I dwell?
[2:04:34] &gt;&gt; Right.
[2:04:34] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:04:36] And God watches and the and he's got a
[2:04:40] son and he fellowshipped with him and
[2:04:41] his bride, his wife
[2:04:45] and they fall
[2:04:48] and he starts quickly. He won't leave
[2:04:50] them there. He starts quickly to build
[2:04:52] them up
[2:04:54] &gt;&gt; and Seth and Enos
[2:04:57] &gt;&gt; come and then uh the lineage comes comes
[2:05:01] Noah
[2:05:03] found a man perfect but the sons of God
[2:05:06] have taken the children of daughters of
[2:05:09] men going to destroy this
[2:05:13] going to destroy this world and he comes
[2:05:15] up out of the ark and keeps continuing
[2:05:17] on moving on through centuries centuries
[2:05:20] of time centuries ies
[2:05:22] and along through this humanity
[2:05:27] moving moving along God's focus. I'm
[2:05:30] going to come.
[2:05:32] I'm going to come. I'm going to redeem
[2:05:35] that earth. I'm going to take a part of
[2:05:37] that very earth cursed earth and I'm
[2:05:40] going to bring it all the way to
[2:05:42] redemption. I'm going to take it in a
[2:05:44] body. I'm going to take it by the word
[2:05:46] of God, by my own decree. I'll live out
[2:05:49] every decree, everyone. And I'll take
[2:05:51] that cursed body to the to the cross and
[2:05:54] through death. And I'll slay death by
[2:05:57] taking it through death. And and then my
[2:05:59] own spirit raise up that body of clay
[2:06:02] out of there. And it will not be in the
[2:06:04] tomb.
[2:06:06] &gt;&gt; And they'll come looking for it. It
[2:06:08] won't be there. But at the same time,
[2:06:10] he's also following another lineage on
[2:06:12] down
[2:06:14] from this from this man to that man on
[2:06:16] the way down. And finally, here's a
[2:06:18] little girl. At the same time that what
[2:06:22] is in his mind now, he's got a little
[2:06:24] girl there and and and he doesn't teach
[2:06:27] her a bunch of things. He gives her his
[2:06:29] word and she believes his word and
[2:06:31] there's conceived in her womb.
[2:06:34] Hallelujah. And God, are you with me?
[2:06:37] &gt;&gt; God so loved the world, he gave his only
[2:06:40] begotten son. His son lived in a body of
[2:06:43] cursed earth
[2:06:46] &gt;&gt; in order that he could give you a body
[2:06:48] that's not of the earth cursed
[2:06:55] &gt;&gt; and he's bringing forth redemption and
[2:06:57] then after that and I've got to got to
[2:06:59] move quickly but I don't want to lose my
[2:07:02] main thought and he's moving on down in
[2:07:05] a corporate that was corporate that was
[2:07:07] the people that was humanity that was
[2:07:10] even before Even before
[2:07:13] Israel become a nation, even before he
[2:07:15] talked to Abraham, even before he told
[2:07:17] him he'd have a son, God had in his mind
[2:07:20] redemption.
[2:07:21] &gt;&gt; I'm going to bring it down. I'm going to
[2:07:23] move it on down. And he's got his mind
[2:07:25] focused on that.
[2:07:28] And his mind focused on see that would
[2:07:30] be a carrier of the word.
[2:07:36] And then
[2:07:39] he comes, he goes through his life, his
[2:07:40] death, his burial, his resurrection,
[2:07:43] and his ascension.
[2:07:45] And this same Jesus that you've seen go
[2:07:47] will come in like manner.
[2:07:48] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:07:50] &gt;&gt; And the Holy Spirit comes down into the
[2:07:52] church. I need to take you so you get my
[2:07:55] my thought. Comes down to the church and
[2:07:57] now it's a corporate body. What was in
[2:08:00] the corporal body of Jesus Christ, a
[2:08:02] single body, is now in the corporal
[2:08:04] body, the church. and that but it's the
[2:08:06] same life only now it's in a different
[2:08:08] place and it moves through that corporal
[2:08:11] body all the way through all the way
[2:08:13] through and then there comes a time and
[2:08:15] he's got to identify where he's at at a
[2:08:17] certain junction so he comes and he
[2:08:19] makes his revelation in a man then he
[2:08:22] comes to the next junction in a man and
[2:08:24] the next junction in a man in the next
[2:08:27] junction a man but in the last one in
[2:08:30] the last junction it has to be very
[2:08:32] different
[2:08:34] &gt;&gt; this has to be very different.
[2:08:37] I wish I could convey to you
[2:08:44] where I personally think Jesus Christ
[2:08:45] was.
[2:08:47] He came as close physically
[2:08:50] as he possibly could
[2:08:53] in the ministry of God's prophet.
[2:08:56] &gt;&gt; That's what I believe. He came as close
[2:09:00] to being in a corporal body as he could
[2:09:05] without coming and standing. He would
[2:09:07] have had to break the plan. The plan is
[2:09:11] I will come again and receive you unto
[2:09:14] myself. That where notice how the
[2:09:17] scripture now listen to all you people
[2:09:19] got question your mind. Notice the
[2:09:20] scripture.
[2:09:22] The scripture is the absolute. I will
[2:09:25] come again. And anyone in the church
[2:09:27] world will say that's the second coming.
[2:09:29] All right. Well, let's just take it. And
[2:09:31] I will come again and receive you unto
[2:09:34] myself that where I am there ye may be
[2:09:39] also. Not that I'm coming where you are
[2:09:42] dwelling, but I'm and and he had to come
[2:09:45] so close that he would attract the
[2:09:49] people. And these people that begin to
[2:09:51] see this Christ, they're able to look
[2:09:54] beyond the human veil,
[2:09:56] &gt;&gt; they're able now, they begin to realize
[2:09:58] because the human veil is saying he's
[2:10:00] become word again
[2:10:03] &gt;&gt; and this is his word coming
[2:10:05] &gt;&gt; and the people are gripped with the
[2:10:07] word. The people see him in the word. We
[2:10:10] see it clearly. This is a word coming.
[2:10:13] This is the form of the word. He's taken
[2:10:14] on another form.
[2:10:17] &gt;&gt; And we believe it and confess it and are
[2:10:20] baptized unto it. And the spirit of God
[2:10:23] comes and quickens that word.
[2:10:28] &gt;&gt; And the bride now
[2:10:31] is the wrapping,
[2:10:36] &gt;&gt; the wrapping
[2:10:38] &gt;&gt; of the glorious gift.
[2:10:41] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:10:42] It's a simple wrapping.
[2:10:44] &gt;&gt; It's a humble wrapping. It's a wrapping
[2:10:47] filled with mistakes. It's a wrapping
[2:10:49] filled with error.
[2:10:51] &gt;&gt; Some of us feel like we're recycled.
[2:10:56] &gt;&gt; But it's a wrapping.
[2:10:58] &gt;&gt; Oh, he wrapped himself in such
[2:11:00] simplicity in his first coming. Wrapped
[2:11:03] himself in such simplicity that when he
[2:11:05] came and he was coming great with child,
[2:11:10] &gt;&gt; it was him
[2:11:12] said they went down to Egypt.
[2:11:14] &gt;&gt; They went down to Egypt because of him.
[2:11:18] &gt;&gt; They went to be taxed because of him.
[2:11:22] &gt;&gt; It was him that was going down there
[2:11:25] &gt;&gt; and here she was a little girl
[2:11:28] pregnant.
[2:11:30] And the first thing was
[2:11:34] in that very religious nation, the whole
[2:11:38] religious nation of Israel is going a
[2:11:42] little girl, teenage girl pregnant.
[2:11:46] She was the wrapping at that moment
[2:11:50] &gt;&gt; and the wrapping was reproached,
[2:11:53] &gt;&gt; spoken evil against.
[2:11:55] &gt;&gt; And when he came and even grew to be a
[2:11:58] man, the the reproach was still hanging
[2:12:00] there. And the uh great religious leader
[2:12:03] says, "We be not born of fornication."
[2:12:07] They still held that you're born of
[2:12:10] fornication. Your mother was pregnant as
[2:12:13] a teenage girl.
[2:12:15] She bore it. She was the wrapping. And
[2:12:19] then the God was wrapped in human flesh.
[2:12:23] &gt;&gt; And there was no beauty
[2:12:26] &gt;&gt; that we would desire him.
[2:12:29] &gt;&gt; If he was here today, you would not find
[2:12:31] him charismatic,
[2:12:34] &gt;&gt; but gracious words would come from his
[2:12:36] lips
[2:12:37] &gt;&gt; and he would speak the same message that
[2:12:39] we have spoken today.
[2:12:42] &gt;&gt; Are you with me? Do you understand what
[2:12:44] I'm saying?
[2:12:47] &gt;&gt; And so today he's wrapped in utter
[2:12:49] simplicity. But those people, yeah, that
[2:12:53] cult, they fall dead. I say, "Praise
[2:12:56] God."
[2:12:57] &gt;&gt; Thank God I can bear his reproach.
[2:13:01] &gt;&gt; And that's why the Apostle Paul said,
[2:13:03] "Let us go unto him outside of the camp
[2:13:07] bearing his reproach." I say to all of
[2:13:09] you people here, you want to be
[2:13:11] glorified in God that you're able to
[2:13:14] bear his reproach.
[2:13:18] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:13:19] &gt;&gt; It's a blessed thing to be able to bear
[2:13:21] his reproach.
[2:13:22] &gt;&gt; We are now. We're now. And we're not
[2:13:24] going to try to make this a a glamorous
[2:13:29] wrapping.
[2:13:32] I get more worried over people seeing,
[2:13:35] oh my, you people have had some success.
[2:13:39] I don't want people to come here because
[2:13:40] of success. I don't want people to come
[2:13:42] here because God is using the place or
[2:13:45] using the brothers or whatever more. We
[2:13:48] we we don't want to attract people for
[2:13:50] those things. We want to attract people
[2:13:52] because they have a hunger and thirst
[2:13:54] after God and that they will be buried
[2:13:56] in the in the baptism of the Holy
[2:13:59] Spirit. Can you say
[2:14:00] &gt;&gt; amen?
[2:14:04] &gt;&gt; And so I'm concluding
[2:14:07] and listen friends, don't get lost in
[2:14:09] the numbers.
[2:14:11] &gt;&gt; I'll just go back a couple thousand
[2:14:13] years. Just a couple thousand years. I
[2:14:16] would say back from the beginnings of
[2:14:19] the and way into the eternities, God's
[2:14:22] focus was on the moment that he would
[2:14:24] send his son
[2:14:26] as a sacrifice to redeem the world. And
[2:14:29] once that had taken place, now one has
[2:14:33] to come out of this cursed earth that
[2:14:37] will be a wife
[2:14:39] to my son,
[2:14:43] &gt;&gt; a bride
[2:14:45] for the bridegroom,
[2:14:47] &gt;&gt; a wife for the lamb,
[2:14:50] &gt;&gt; who will be worthy? And God kept his
[2:14:53] focus on that life and brought it all
[2:14:55] through.
[2:14:58] But I I say to you in the name of the
[2:15:00] Lord, his focus was right on this time,
[2:15:03] &gt;&gt; right on this junction.
[2:15:05] &gt;&gt; And a whole lot of scriptures
[2:15:07] scriptures while you're sitting here
[2:15:09] that may are in the process of being
[2:15:11] fulfilled right now.
[2:15:13] &gt;&gt; And so I want you to be able to leave
[2:15:15] here and ask yourself the question,
[2:15:17] where are we? Where am I in this process
[2:15:22] of the coming of Jesus Christ? God has
[2:15:27] allowed me to have ears to hear the last
[2:15:31] messenger's voice,
[2:15:33] &gt;&gt; to be gripped
[2:15:36] by the awesome vindication.
[2:15:39] &gt;&gt; What is your purpose, Lord?
[2:15:41] &gt;&gt; Help me, oh God, to move move right into
[2:15:46] the right up into the realm. Help me to
[2:15:50] be so sensitive.
[2:15:52] Help me to be so conscious. May this be
[2:15:55] the thing that's uppermost in my mind
[2:15:58] even while I'm doing my daily duties and
[2:16:00] whatever more.
[2:16:03] And may your life I pray in the name of
[2:16:05] Jesus Christ be so ordered
[2:16:08] in your home
[2:16:13] in your work
[2:16:15] and in your service to Christ
[2:16:18] in the body of Christ. May that be the
[2:16:23] guiding light and the directing the
[2:16:26] directing force. And we speak about you
[2:16:29] know beautiful star of Bethlehem. I pray
[2:16:32] that that beautiful star
[2:16:35] which is hovers over this message. It
[2:16:38] hovers over his word. I pray that
[2:16:41] beautiful star will be your guiding
[2:16:42] light through this world that's very
[2:16:45] very dark and it's dark out there. grows
[2:16:47] darkness upon the people, but upon you
[2:16:49] it shall be light.
[2:16:51] &gt;&gt; Isn't he lovely?
[2:16:55] &gt;&gt; Let's bow in prayer.
[2:16:58] Oh, gracious and loving father.
[2:17:02] We have read and I have related.
[2:17:06] I have rehearsed
[2:17:09] what I believe is your word to the
[2:17:12] people.
[2:17:14] Why do you hunger, church?
[2:17:18] That's the father
[2:17:20] trying to reveal himself to you. And
[2:17:23] Lord, throughout this day, there will be
[2:17:26] many different activities.
[2:17:30] Homes will be visited,
[2:17:33] some Christian, some religious, some not
[2:17:36] religious.
[2:17:38] People are going different directions.
[2:17:42] But in in the midst of all of this, oh
[2:17:44] lovely one,
[2:17:46] who was the image of the invisible God
[2:17:51] and in that image you sat
[2:17:54] and there was a woman ill-famed woman
[2:17:57] and she saw you with dirty feet and saw
[2:18:00] how how wrong that was and she washed
[2:18:05] your feet with her tears.
[2:18:08] Lord, there may be there may be someone
[2:18:11] here, no doubt is
[2:18:14] that's away from you that has
[2:18:18] perhaps not denied the faith, but they
[2:18:20] have not lived in the faith. They're not
[2:18:23] where they should be. And they've
[2:18:25] disregarded you and disregarded your
[2:18:28] wooing and put it off for another time
[2:18:30] when things will be different in their
[2:18:32] life.
[2:18:34] But oh God,
[2:18:37] time has moved on. Weeks and months and
[2:18:40] years have moved on. I pray you will
[2:18:44] brand their minds with a flame of fire
[2:18:48] of the hour that we're in and you'll
[2:18:50] take something that's been spoken today
[2:18:53] and anchor it in their heart, in their
[2:18:57] soul, so they cannot move away from it.
[2:18:59] And I pray Lord again today there'll be
[2:19:02] tears of repentance and they will wash
[2:19:04] the feet oh God wash the feet of this
[2:19:08] lovely one Christ they will come with
[2:19:10] such sincerity and even now may their
[2:19:13] heart turn into an altar as they give
[2:19:16] themselves and say Lord I give myself to
[2:19:19] you father I'd be so rewarded that would
[2:19:22] be the only reward I would desire if I
[2:19:25] can cause someone to surrender
[2:19:28] themselves to you so completely,
[2:19:32] Lord. No doubt there are
[2:19:35] those that will be honest with
[2:19:37] themselves,
[2:19:38] say, "Oh, my enemy has worked so hard to
[2:19:43] try to get it out of me. I'm not going
[2:19:45] to make a bunch of excuses.
[2:19:47] I'm not going to blame it on other
[2:19:49] people. I'm not going to blame it on
[2:19:50] other situations.
[2:19:53] I'm simply going to say, Lord, from this
[2:19:56] time,
[2:19:57] from this day on,
[2:20:00] I will listen to that voice that is
[2:20:02] within me.
[2:20:05] Your calling and your seeking to make
[2:20:08] yourself known to me.
[2:20:12] I wonder how many
[2:20:15] would like to stand and say, I want to
[2:20:17] make that resolve.
[2:20:20] The world is a very
[2:20:23] deceptive place.
[2:20:25] I want to give my all
[2:20:28] this morning.
[2:20:32] I want to be that not that carrier of
[2:20:35] the seed but the seed itself.
[2:20:39] Lord Jesus,
[2:20:42] for this these that are standing,
[2:20:46] these oh God that they have a I believe
[2:20:49] the same craving that I have this
[2:20:52] morning. We just want to say to you,
[2:20:55] take us Lord as your disciples,
[2:21:00] your children. We both want to serve you
[2:21:04] and we want to love you.
[2:21:06] We want to be an expression that is so
[2:21:10] clear.
[2:21:12] &gt;&gt; We want to be an unmistakable voice.
[2:21:16] We want you to live in us.
[2:21:18] &gt;&gt; So that people will see you
[2:21:20] unquestionably,
[2:21:22] unmistakably be able to declare, I see
[2:21:25] Jesus Christ in you.
[2:21:28] Let it be, oh God. And all that are
[2:21:30] visiting us and that are here, I pray
[2:21:33] their hearts will be deeply stirred.
[2:21:36] in Jesus Christ's name.
[2:21:40] Amen. All that I have. All that I am.
[2:21:47] All that I am.
[2:21:52] All that I am.
[2:21:58] All
[2:21:59] I shall ever
[2:22:03] be.
[2:22:08] Can I be
[2:22:12] the
[2:22:14] I
[2:22:16] [Music]
[2:22:20] surrender
[2:22:22] to thee.
[2:22:24] &gt;&gt; The sister that's being baptized,
[2:22:26] perhaps you'll go and just make ready to
[2:22:28] be baptized now. And we'll have the
[2:22:30] baptismal in just a few moments.
[2:22:33] Can we take this time
[2:22:39] to meditate,
[2:22:41] to ponder in this quietness because I
[2:22:44] know that when you leave here, it's
[2:22:45] going to be a hustle. It's going to be a
[2:22:47] whatever going to be lost to occupy your
[2:22:50] thoughts
[2:22:52] under the influence of the Holy Spirit.
[2:22:56] under the influence of the word which
[2:22:57] I've spoken today and I felt so
[2:23:01] I pray that you'll not be able to
[2:23:05] forget it. I'm praying that the Holy
[2:23:08] Spirit will just keep
[2:23:11] [Music]
[2:23:12] bringing it to you that he'll make it a
[2:23:15] constant something you're constantly
[2:23:17] thinking about.
[2:23:24] If I read my scripture right
[2:23:27] and read the message correct,
[2:23:31] the bride of Jesus Christ is not merely
[2:23:34] the carrier, not the carrier anymore.
[2:23:37] the bride of Jesus Christ. You people
[2:23:39] standing here,
[2:23:43] God brought you here
[2:23:46] to this season so that he could actually
[2:23:49] dwell in you, actually live in your
[2:23:54] flesh, live in your body. Do you believe
[2:23:58] that much?
[2:24:00] as he saw Mary come on down through the
[2:24:03] centuries. As he saw the very life that
[2:24:06] would come down and be that body that
[2:24:09] would be created in her, that same God
[2:24:13] ordained you to this very moment of time
[2:24:19] so that he focused on his own life
[2:24:22] coming down, down, down. You think that
[2:24:24] he's interested for a moment in all of
[2:24:26] this sin and confusion and darkness? Do
[2:24:29] you think he's interested in what's
[2:24:30] happening around the country? Not a bit.
[2:24:33] Not a bit. He's focused on one.
[2:24:37] &gt;&gt; I don't know if you're understanding me.
[2:24:40] &gt;&gt; Why was it just a few shepherds? I'm
[2:24:43] trying to say, why was it just a handful
[2:24:44] of people? Because it's going to be few
[2:24:47] in the end time. We might be a few
[2:24:48] hundred people. We're just a handful of
[2:24:50] people. That's all. We're not a lot of
[2:24:52] people. We're just a handful of people,
[2:24:54] but God ordained before the foundation
[2:24:57] of the world and especially since
[2:24:59] Pentecost. And he just follows that life
[2:25:01] on down on down. It'll come to a Luther
[2:25:04] junction, a Wesley junction, a Pentecost
[2:25:06] junction. It'll come to the end and
[2:25:08] there'll be a messenger. I'm going to
[2:25:10] dwell in him.
[2:25:12] &gt;&gt; I'm going to show I'm going to show the
[2:25:14] world
[2:25:16] what I can do
[2:25:17] &gt;&gt; through a fully adopted son.
[2:25:21] Friends, God didn't bring you here on
[2:25:23] the scene so we could rem re remain a
[2:25:25] bunch of infants.
[2:25:27] &gt;&gt; Infants in the scripture.
[2:25:30] &gt;&gt; He brought us here so we could be mature
[2:25:33] men and women.
[2:25:35] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:25:37] &gt;&gt; I got this little problem or I got this
[2:25:39] little trouble with this sister or this
[2:25:40] brother. I say nonsense.
[2:25:43] &gt;&gt; We got a higher calling.
[2:25:46] &gt;&gt; None of these things are to afflict us.
[2:25:50] mature sons and daughters of God.
[2:25:54] &gt;&gt; One that can look at a hardship, look at
[2:25:56] a reproach and say, "Oh, God just sent
[2:25:58] it my way. It's good for me."
[2:26:02] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:26:04] &gt;&gt; What What are you here?
[2:26:07] Brother Rod used that phrase.
[2:26:11] Why are we here?
[2:26:14] It's really amazing. Brother Rod,
[2:26:17] this last week, first part of the week,
[2:26:20] I thought the same thing.
[2:26:22] What am I doing here? Where are we at?
[2:26:28] You say, "Well, Brother Biser, you said
[2:26:29] that several times. I'll probably say it
[2:26:31] a lot more times cuz I want to know not
[2:26:33] only today and not only tonight, but
[2:26:35] tomorrow and next week. I want to know
[2:26:37] where we're at in the word." And Holy
[2:26:39] Spirit, move us. Move us. Move us. Keep
[2:26:42] moving me on. Keep making yourself
[2:26:44] known.
[2:26:48] Brother Brandham says
[2:26:54] why we're here. Why are we here?
[2:26:58] Said we're here to help you.
[2:27:00] I'm taking this personally and to this
[2:27:03] congregation and all that are listening.
[2:27:06] [Music]
[2:27:07] We're here to help you.
[2:27:14] If if we see that God promised these
[2:27:17] things,
[2:27:19] If we see that God has promised these
[2:27:21] things, we're here to see them come to
[2:27:24] pass.
[2:27:27] &gt;&gt; We're here to represent the Lord Jesus
[2:27:29] Christ and his resurrection.
[2:27:31] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:27:33] &gt;&gt; We're not here for doctrines.
[2:27:35] We're here to worship the Lord.
[2:27:38] &gt;&gt; We're here to preach the gospel.
[2:27:41] &gt;&gt; We're here to influence
[2:27:44] Hallelujah.
[2:27:45] &gt;&gt; You're here to influence somebody.
[2:27:48] &gt;&gt; And we are here to identify ourselves as
[2:27:50] your servants as a true witness of the
[2:27:53] Bible.
[2:27:55] &gt;&gt; And we're here to turn our attention
[2:27:58] towards eternal things and to the life
[2:28:00] that lays beyond this mortal reach.
[2:28:04] That's why we're here. And we are
[2:28:06] claiming by grace and love that we are
[2:28:10] here to represent. I want the
[2:28:13] congregation to say amen. We're here to
[2:28:15] represent the bride and believing
[2:28:18] associate with him in his kingdom. I'm
[2:28:21] here to represent the bride of Jesus
[2:28:24] Christ and to declare by my presence
[2:28:26] here each one of us that we are
[2:28:28] associated in the kingdom of God. Can
[2:28:31] you say amen?
[2:28:35] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:28:37] All that I am,
[2:28:42] oh All
[2:28:44] [Applause]
[2:28:46] [Music]
[2:28:52] [Music]
[2:29:02] the
[2:29:04] I
[2:29:06] [Music]
[2:29:09] surrender
[2:29:11] to thee.
[2:29:16] &gt;&gt; Isn't he
[2:29:18] wonderful?
[2:29:21] Wonderful.
[2:29:23] Wonderful.
[2:29:26] Isn't Jesus
[2:29:29] my Lord? Wonderful.
[2:29:34] My eyes have seen earus.
[2:29:43] [Music]
[2:29:45] [Applause]
[2:29:47] [Music]
[2:29:53] &gt;&gt; You know the Lord is present.
[2:29:56] So very present.
[2:29:59] Do you sense him? Amen.
[2:30:02] &gt;&gt; And that realm is so mystical and so
[2:30:04] wonderful
[2:30:08] and Sister Vanessa
[2:30:11] [Music]
[2:30:13] while I was in the midst
[2:30:15] of hearing the prophet
[2:30:17] speak to a woman
[2:30:20] and he spoke with power and authority
[2:30:24] and told her to go and be healed
[2:30:28] and your
[2:30:33] you came to my thoughts and I said let
[2:30:35] it be
[2:30:36] &gt;&gt; for Vanessa as well.
[2:30:39] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:30:41] &gt;&gt; Our God
[2:30:43] &gt;&gt; is the same
[2:30:44] &gt;&gt; yesterday, today and forever. And why
[2:30:47] should we expect anything less?
[2:30:49] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. He's alive.
[2:30:53] &gt;&gt; Give him glory.
[2:30:56] &gt;&gt; This is what he's here for.
[2:30:59] He's not a god of wood or stone.
[2:31:02] &gt;&gt; He's a god of the supernatural
[2:31:05] &gt;&gt; and he's worthy of all of our life. He's
[2:31:08] worthy of all of our energy. What do you
[2:31:10] say, young man? Is he worthy of
[2:31:12] everything? Then give him everything. I
[2:31:14] say in the name of the Lord, young
[2:31:16] ladies, give him everything. Is he worth
[2:31:19] everything? Give him everything. Is he
[2:31:22] worth our families? Give him our
[2:31:23] families. Hallelujah. He's worth
[2:31:26] everything.
[2:31:28] Hold back nothing from him.
[2:31:30] &gt;&gt; Glory to God. God bless you, brother
[2:31:33] John. You may be seated.
[2:31:39] [Music]
[2:31:42] Amen. God bless you this afternoon. I'm
[2:31:46] just standing in the water with Marlene
[2:31:48] Barton and I was just uh preparing for
[2:31:52] uh this afternoon and this uh
[2:31:54] resurrection that we're going to have
[2:31:56] this death, burial, and resurrection. I
[2:31:58] was thinking it wasn't just going to be
[2:32:00] for Marlene, but I felt for all of us
[2:32:02] also it was an opportunity to recognize
[2:32:05] that in it was in this season of the
[2:32:08] year that the Messiah was revealed to
[2:32:12] people like us. And it was at the same
[2:32:14] time that uh Sister Marlene actually it
[2:32:16] was several weeks ago that she uh had
[2:32:19] asked about baptism. We've just been
[2:32:20] waiting. Uh she's been coming to the
[2:32:23] assembly since August and has been
[2:32:26] affected by the word of God and she she
[2:32:29] desires the Holy Spirit. And it was at
[2:32:31] the time just a couple weeks ago that I
[2:32:33] was also listening to why it had to be
[2:32:35] shepherds. And there was certain words
[2:32:39] that brother Brandham was using about
[2:32:41] the shepherds of why that the word was
[2:32:45] revealed to them and why it was that
[2:32:48] that certain ones were the ones that
[2:32:51] that God made the message known to. And
[2:32:54] it reminded me also of in the scripture
[2:32:56] when there was an invitation to come to
[2:32:58] the feast and those that were bidden
[2:33:00] didn't want to come. So the word went
[2:33:02] out to go to the highways and go to the
[2:33:04] byways and get those that would receive
[2:33:06] the message. But there were certain
[2:33:08] words that brother Brandham used in that
[2:33:11] message why it had to be shepherds
[2:33:13] describing the shepherds. And I thought
[2:33:15] it was so uh pertinent, sister Marleene,
[2:33:17] not just for yourself but for all of us
[2:33:19] as believers. Brother Brandham said they
[2:33:22] were humble, they were uneducated,
[2:33:25] they were common, they were unlearned,
[2:33:28] they were poor, they were simple, they
[2:33:32] were untrained, they were uncultured,
[2:33:35] they were illiterate, they were called
[2:33:37] the ignorant and unlearned, they were
[2:33:40] common, and they were people of low
[2:33:42] degree.
[2:33:43] &gt;&gt; But that's who God revealed the word to.
[2:33:45] Amen.
[2:33:46] &gt;&gt; And I was thinking how God passed by all
[2:33:49] the trained, all the cultured, all the
[2:33:51] people that thought they had it together
[2:33:54] and has revealed himself to Sister
[2:33:56] Marlene. And I thought, "What an
[2:33:58] incredible day today on Christmas Eve
[2:34:02] when Sister Marleene was asked, "What
[2:34:04] would be the greatest gift thing that
[2:34:06] you could have?" And and her response
[2:34:08] was is she wanted to be baptized. She
[2:34:11] wanted to give that gift within her life
[2:34:14] back to Jesus Christ. I feel that we're
[2:34:17] right back again, not 2,000 years ago,
[2:34:20] but we're finding oursel this morning to
[2:34:23] some more shepherds
[2:34:24] &gt;&gt; and to a lady that has found her place
[2:34:28] in the word of God. Sister Marine.
[2:34:31] &gt;&gt; Yeah. I became in believe I be coming in
[2:34:35] several months to church and the
[2:34:39] greatest gift I can have for Christmas
[2:34:41] is being baptized in the holy name of
[2:34:44] Jesus Christ. Amen.
[2:34:47] &gt;&gt; Amen. Can we agree together
[2:34:49] &gt;&gt; that this great spirit that's been
[2:34:51] around her for all these months now
[2:34:53] since August would just come fluttering
[2:34:56] right inside and give her the desire of
[2:34:58] her heart. Amen.
[2:35:01] Heavenly Father,
[2:35:03] I believe your focus is here this
[2:35:05] morning. Lord, you've chosen to find
[2:35:09] humble and honest hearts, sincere hearts
[2:35:13] that would just simply respond to the
[2:35:15] message, respond to the word that has
[2:35:19] come. And Sister Marlene has it upon her
[2:35:22] heart to surrender herself. She's
[2:35:25] repented. She desires a greater change
[2:35:28] within her life. Not to just see it in
[2:35:31] others, but to see it in her own life.
[2:35:34] So, we are here today as believers also
[2:35:37] with her to honor her request and ask
[2:35:40] that Jesus Christ and that great dove of
[2:35:43] God would be born within this manger
[2:35:46] today. That the Holy Spirit, Father,
[2:35:49] would fill our sister Marlene with the
[2:35:51] Holy Spirit. This promise as we read in
[2:35:54] the book of Acts, which is unto you and
[2:35:57] to your children, and to those that are
[2:35:59] a far off, and to as many as the Lord
[2:36:02] our God shall call. And you've been
[2:36:04] calling. You've been dealing. There's
[2:36:06] been something coming upon our sister
[2:36:08] Marlene. And we pray, Father, that that
[2:36:11] something would come inside of her and
[2:36:14] cause this predestinated seed to be born
[2:36:17] within her life. Lord, you've come in
[2:36:20] our day as you did to shepherds long ago
[2:36:23] to us poor, maybe illiterate, not
[2:36:26] knowing everything, untrained and
[2:36:28] uncultured. But we are asking that this
[2:36:31] gift would be open this morning, this
[2:36:34] afternoon within our sister Marlene's
[2:36:36] life. Bless her. Continue to unfold
[2:36:39] yourself within her life. Reveal
[2:36:41] yourself in a greater way from this
[2:36:44] moment on. May Lord everything about
[2:36:47] this experience be so real to sister
[2:36:49] Marlene Lord that this daughter of yours
[2:36:52] could come to her perfection in Jesus
[2:36:55] Christ. We bless her in Jesus name.
[2:36:59] Amen.
[2:37:01] Sister Marlene according to your desire
[2:37:04] and your willingness to be identified
[2:37:06] and married to Jesus Christ. I now
[2:37:08] baptize you in true Christian baptism in
[2:37:11] the name of our Lord Jesus Christ. Amen.
[2:37:17] &gt;&gt; Amen. Bless you. Thank you, Jesus. Amen.
[2:37:21] Praise the Lord. Thank you, Jesus. Bless
[2:37:25] you. Amen.
[2:37:30] [Music]
[2:37:35] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[2:37:41] Well,
[2:37:44] I'll have you stand.
[2:37:46] [Music]
[2:37:57] I don't need any gift
[2:37:59] from the world or any gift of any kind.
[2:38:02] I already received the gift.
[2:38:05] Not only Christ but his promise
[2:38:11] [Music]
[2:38:14] I will come and receive you to myself
[2:38:17] that where I am
[2:38:20] there you may be also
[2:38:24] to me that's the most wonderful thing.
[2:38:29] Hey, remember
[2:38:31] brother Brandham was with millions of
[2:38:33] people.
[2:38:36] And he said, "I want to see Jesus. Where
[2:38:40] is Jesus?
[2:38:42] He's just a little higher."
[2:38:44] You know what that tells me? We're just
[2:38:47] going to go a little higher than even
[2:38:48] where he was at that time. We're going
[2:38:50] to go higher. It's
[2:38:53] our gift that he's given to us. lovely
[2:38:57] bridegroom.
[2:38:59] Oh, how wonderful he is. I hope you I'm
[2:39:02] sure you do feel what I'm feeling with
[2:39:06] inside. So, I want to sing about that
[2:39:08] that place and we'll sing together.

[2:44:32] I'd like to call brother Lance. Laru,

[2:44:36] Brother Lance.
[2:44:41] Isn't he lovely?
[2:44:43] &gt;&gt; Oh, we so thank him.
[2:44:47] Are you thankful this season?
[2:44:50] Thankful the Lord has brought you to
[2:44:52] this glorious word.
[2:44:55] How beautiful he is. How wonderful he
[2:44:58] is. We praise your name, Lord. We bless
[2:45:01] your name.
[2:45:05] It's good to just be quiet before God
[2:45:10] to give him this
[2:45:13] complete surrender of ourselves,
[2:45:15] dedicate ourselves to him.
[2:45:18] Hallelujah.
[2:45:21] Brother Lance, God bless you.
[2:45:25] Our gracious heavenly father,
[2:45:29] we want to say Lord that there is no one
[2:45:31] like you.
[2:45:34] You are the one that's more than able to
[2:45:37] minister and to touch lives and change
[2:45:41] lives.
[2:45:43] And Father, every opportunity that we
[2:45:45] have to sit at your feet, we realize
[2:45:48] it's an opportunity
[2:45:50] to come to a place where we can know you
[2:45:52] more and be affected by your presence.
[2:45:56] And Lord, as we have gathered even this
[2:45:59] morning and we have sat and we have
[2:46:01] listened to the word of God,
[2:46:04] we're praying, Father, that word that
[2:46:07] has been ministered by scripture,
[2:46:10] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[2:46:10] &gt;&gt; will not
[2:46:12] &gt;&gt; return void.
[2:46:13] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[2:46:14] &gt;&gt; But Lord Jesus, it will reach forth with
[2:46:19] divine hands
[2:46:21] &gt;&gt; and change lives.
[2:46:24] Father, what you do, you do well. And
[2:46:27] so, Lord, we want to humble ourselves to
[2:46:29] the word of God. And we know as we
[2:46:32] humble ourselves, the very effects of
[2:46:34] that word will take place within our
[2:46:36] lives. Lord, I pray you bless this
[2:46:39] congregation.
[2:46:40] We pray that you bless them for the
[2:46:42] desire that they have within their heart
[2:46:44] to know you. And Jesus, we believe even
[2:46:47] as the scripture hath said that they
[2:46:49] that hunger and thirst after
[2:46:51] righteousness shall be filled. Father,
[2:46:54] these are not the words of a man. This
[2:46:56] is not just something that we can speak
[2:46:58] and rattle uh through through through uh
[2:47:02] words that have no meaning. But Father,
[2:47:04] these are your words. These people shall
[2:47:08] be filled. And Lord, may that filling
[2:47:10] continue even as we leave this afternoon
[2:47:14] and we uh we enjoy each other's
[2:47:17] companionship. People will be visiting
[2:47:19] family. Father, may the the grace of God
[2:47:23] just go with us. May you bless the
[2:47:26] people. And Father, may above all
[2:47:28] things, you remain the number one
[2:47:30] priority in our lives. In Jesus Christ's
[2:47:34] name, we pray that you continue to
[2:47:36] minister to us, Father. Amen. And amen.
[2:47:40] Amen.
