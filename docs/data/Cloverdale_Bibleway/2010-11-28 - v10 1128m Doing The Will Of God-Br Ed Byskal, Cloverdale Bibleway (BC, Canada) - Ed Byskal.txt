Briner this morning has just been diagnosed with inoperable cancer. Is only months to live. Please pray for God's will, healing, and the saving of his soul. Amen. I'm sure there's many unspoken requests here this morning, family members represented that aren't here. My wife is at home, uh, sick and body, but knowing that the Lord is gracious to extend his healing touch in our family, and just trust that each one will receive the portion of the word this morning in our lives. Brother Darren, would you come? [Music] Heavenly Father, we are so thankful, Lord Jesus, to approach you this morning. As the word says, as the as you see the end approach, Lord, to gather yourselves so much more together. &gt;&gt; Lord, we want to just say thank you for these opportunities, Lord. Thank you for these times of refreshing for our souls that we can come and drink from that fountain, Lord, that shall never run dry. that we can feast at the master's table, Lord God. Well, we'll never grow hungry, Lord. Lord Jesus, you have a bountiful storehouse open for us, Lord Jesus, to receive this morning. No matter what it is that we have need of, dear God, you're our provider. You're the one who gives us strength. You're the one who releases us, oh God, from all bondage, from all our trials, all our complexes. Lord Jesus, you're the one that gives eternal life. Dear God, you're the one that brings healing to our bodies, dear Lord Jesus. All we have need of, dear God, your hand supplies it, Lord God. And tonight, Lord Jesus, or this morning, we're asking, dear God, that you would meet with us in a personal way, Lord God. Not just on our flesh realm, oh God. Not just our spirit realm, but the inside of the inside, dear God, that you would speak to our hearts, Lord, each one of us, Father, that we have would have an impersonal encounter with Jesus Christ this morning. We're not here to meet with each other, dear God. We're here to meet with you. We're here to experience your presence, experience, Lord God, your touch, Lord God, that we can commune, Lord Jesus, with you. Lord, we pray that we would have ears to hear and hearts to receive. Lord, that faith would be quickened this morning, no matter what our needs are, dear God, for we are a needy people, Lord, whether we who are gathered here this morning, those on the internet, Lord, those that may hear this service by the way, the archives, Lord. Heavenly Father, we're praying that our faith would just rise up, Lord, to to meet the occasion, Lord Jesus, that we have need of to claim the promises of God, to apprehend it, Lord God, to embrace it, Lord, not to let go until you touch us, Lord, till we walk differently, Lord God, that we're no longer the same, Lord Jesus. Those that are in financial difficulty, Lord, this is such an hour of financial upheaval, dear God, and we just want to be able to provide for our families, Lord Jesus. We want to be faithful stewards, dear God, to put bread upon the table, dear Lord, to pay our bills, Lord, knowing that you're faithful, Lord God, to meet our needs, that you'd not see your children baking bread. Lord, for those that need physical healing, Lord. Lord, our sister Patricia, her uncle, Lord, being diagnosed with this inoperable cancer, Lord, dear God, this cancer is nothing. Prophet told us, why do you fear cancer? nothing would stand in our way, not even cancer, Lord, if we can just only believe. And Lord Jesus, this man does not have any hope, dear God, outside of Christ. So Lord, may his heart be soft. May it be tender. May it be open, Lord, that he would receive Jesus Christ. Lord, in times like these, we need a savior. Times like these, we need a healer, Lord God. And our sister Patricia's uncle, Lord, he needs not only a healer, he needs a savior, Lord. Would you go to him, Father, in a sovereign way? Would you use our sister Patricia, Lord, our brother's the family, Lord God, to speak to this one, to reach out to that soul, Lord, and Father, and grab it, Lord, as it's falling. Just reach out, Lord Jesus, and just pull it in, Father. We're so thankful, Lord. Remember, Sister Debbie Paris is well, Lord, not feeling well in body, Lord Jesus. We pray that you'd strengthen her, Lord. We pray dear God that you will take away whatever infirmity is Lord that is laying her low dear God that she would be strengthened. She would be refreshed Lord that her faith too Lord God even as she would stream the service this morning Lord Father may her faith be strengthened. May she just stand upon her faith Lord and claim her healing. We just ask that you'll take the man of God this morning, Lord, our pastor. Lord, move the man aside, Lord. Move us aside, Lord Jesus. Put aside our thoughts. Just allow that word just to flow, Lord God, into our hearts. That we would be a different people, Lord, when we walk out of this place, packing the word of God, packing that life of Christ wherever we go, Lord, that we could be Jesus Christ in in flesh once again, testifying to the world that the resurrection is real, that the resurrection is on, the rapture is is on, dear God. &gt;&gt; So, Lord, we just ask that you'll anoint brother Derek as he leads us in worship. Anoint the musicians, Lord, as they they play the instruments, Lord, as they enter in as well. We just want to create an atmosphere, Father, this morning where faith can be, Lord, exercise where we can just believe, dear God, in what you have for us this morning. So, we just thank you for it in advance, Lord, as we receive it, no matter how hard it may come, no matter how cutting it may be, Lord, we just want to fit that perfect mold of Jesus Christ for our lives. So have your way now, Father, as we commit our lives into your hands in Jesus Christ's name. Amen. [Music] [Music] &gt;&gt; There is a 10 open in the house of David. you. [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] And there are streams of grace that's flowing down from [Music] now and receive. Just close your eyes now. There is a fountain open in the house of you. [Music] And there are streams of grace that's flowing down from Calary. Come now and receive just real sweetly once again. There is a fountain open in the house of David to you through [Music] [Applause] [Music] and there are God's grace that's falling down from Calary. Come now and receive. Believe that's why we've come this morning to receive. Have believing hearts. Amen. You may have your seats this morning. As the Sunday school children find their way in and find their seats, we're going to turn the service right over to our pastor this morning. Turn right to the word just as he gets ready to come. We've got an announcement from brother Matthew Redell. There will be a workb this evening after the service to complete labeling the Chinese messages. the New Witness DVD, I believe, preparation and to ship the books. Thank you. And that will take place in the fellowship room. I hope I got all of that right, brother Matthew. All right. So, if you'd like to help out with that, that'll be this evening after this evening's service. That'd be wonderful. Amen. You love the Lord this morning. &gt;&gt; Amen. Everybody have a wonderful Thanksgiving. &gt;&gt; Nice time in the US. I know the Canadians get to enjoy it twice. Well, I got news for you. So do we. we come up and get to enjoy it with you as well. So, it's a real real wonderful time of the year to reflect on the good things that God has done in each one of our lives. Sister Sally, we remembered Brother Edwin. God bless you. Amen. Let's sing Give thanks with a grateful heart as we turn the service over to Brother Ed. Brother Tim, we sang this song the other day when Brother Tim was ministering and that's the way I feel is give thanks. Give thanks with a grateful heart. Sometimes we're going through something, but times we just need to shake that off and just realize that the man within the man really is thankful. &gt;&gt; Sometimes the first man isn't always so thankful or grateful or appreciative, but we can get past that. Amen. Let's sing it together this morning. Give thanks with a grateful heart. Give thanks to the holy one. Give thanks because he's given Jesus Christ his son. Give thanks with a grateful heart. Give thanks to the holy one. Give thanks because he's Jesus Christ his son. and down. Let the weak say I am strong. Let the poor say I am rich because of what the Lord has done. [Music] And now let the weak say I am strong. Let the poor say I am rich because of what the Lord has done for us. Give thanks. Oh, give thanks with a grateful heart. Give thanks to the holy one. Give thanks because he's given &gt;&gt; Jesus Christ, &gt;&gt; his son. Give thanks with a grateful heart. Give thanks to the holy one. Give thanks because he's Jesus Christ his son. And now let the weak say I am strong. Let the poor say I am rich. because of what the Lord has done for us. And now let the weak say I am strong. Let the poor say I am because of the Lord. [Music] Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; What a wonderful day. &gt;&gt; I get in the habit of pulling this microphone up when I don't need it. Uh, I just listened to the to the announcement for brother Matthew was saying to for the workers or whoever is a available to work with the books, the Chinese books or something, you know, there's so much that goes on in the background. God bless you, brother Chim. Such joy. So much goes on in the background that we don't realize. Just this is just uh just before I came to the pull pit and this is from a sister or woman in up in Mongolia and she just has sent this to brother Murphy. Dear brother, I am a sister in Christ from Inner Mongolia. I read Reverend Brham's message by chance recently. I was very shocked his messages got such a light though it was preached 40 years ago. I'm so thankful that the Lord let me con contact this message and also very thankful for the brethren who translated this message and uploaded it on the internet and may our heavenly father remember your labor and bless you abundantly. May there may there are uh more people to see this message and be blessed. Your sister in Christ, Lee Caying, I believe it is. &gt;&gt; So, here we are. You've been in it for maybe years. And here's a sister. Just because somebody translated, somebody's administrating, managing. There's a whole lot of technical things and just plain down to earth practical things that are done. But somebody is rejoicing. &gt;&gt; She can't believe that this message was spoken 40 years ago cuz it sounds like it's right for this moment for her. And it is for this moment for her. How wonderful that is. Amen. &gt;&gt; We'd say, "Praise the Lord." &gt;&gt; I'm so thankful for that. I wonder if we could uh we're going to be calling up the deacons, which we've had acting for some time that we just recently put in. So, if they can get ready, I want to sing the chorus. Uh I lift pardon. &gt;&gt; Lord, I lift. &gt;&gt; Yeah. I lift your name. All right. Let's just stand as we sing it. I lift your name. Your holy name [Music] God, [Music] I will praise you. [Music] Hey, you're Yeah. Heat. my power. [Music] &gt;&gt; Lord Jesus, we worship you in spirit and in truth. We're so thankful for this time that we're able to stand here in your presence, under the banner of your word, under your wings, the everlasting wings. Oh God, now we pray that you will just attend, be in attendance with us in a special way. Lord, as we are calling the new deacons forward, we thank you for men that you have ordained, oh God, and chosen and gifted. We pray, Father, we may follow in your footsteps and may all be pleasing in your sight in Jesus name. Amen. Amen. You may be seated. I'm going to call our brother Mark Ao, brother Doug Hendrickson, brother Martin Woolman, and brother Marco Vaner, and brother Ivan Hang if you would come forward. And then I'd like the other deacons if they could be ready in a few moments. But I want to address uh these brothers before the congregation. uh the scripture speaks of and the prophet of God also made reference to the trial period that there's a trial period. Uh it was some weeks ago. Now we had the congre we brought these brothers before the congregation asked you to raise your hand if you had any objection. If you raised your hand if you were in agreement that these brothers should serve. And then the scripture says, "Likewise must the deacons be grave, not double tonged, not given to much wine, not greedy of filthy lucer, holding the mystery of fa of the faith in a pure conscience. And let those also let these also first be proved." And that's where brother Brandham speaks of the trial period. Let them first be proved. Then let them use the office of a deacon, being found blameless. Even so must their wives be grave, not slanderers, sober, faithful in all things. Let the deacons be the husbands of one wife, ruling their children and their own houses well. For they that have used the office of a deacon well purchased to themselves a good degree and great boldness of faith which is in Christ Jesus. Brother Brenham speaks in placing of the deacons. Says, "And so therefore then it has been found favorable with the board and the pastor and the overseer to select in this group of people here some men who we think will be honorable and just men. we can only bring them and then it's then it's uh and it's then they are appointed by the church by their own vote and then these men shall serve if they feel that they will accept this office. This is the period that they have been in. Then they will come for a short time to see if they feel that they may be that God has called them. And if later if they feel that they are disqualified, then they have a right in the next few weeks to resign the office and someone else could be appointed in their place. We will ordain these deacons by laying on hands, deacons, and treasure in the church. But first they must be appointed and see how they like it and how the congregation likes it. And then if it's all right on both sides, then we make these men ordained deacons. And so I would like if the other deacons would come forward, please, and stand behind these brothers as well. Brother Tom, if you'll come. We'd like the congregation if you'll bow, please, as we join together and pray. Dear heavenly father, you're the one that is looking upon this scene. Yes, &gt;&gt; we are just men. &gt;&gt; We are just human. &gt;&gt; Our knowing is so limited. But you saw each of these men's lives. &gt;&gt; The first step they would take. You knew them before they were conceived. &gt;&gt; You're the almighty, almighty God, all knowing God, allseeing God, and have predestinated us. Oh father, &gt;&gt; Lord Jesus, I pray that these men as they enter into this office that they have been serving &gt;&gt; that there will be a double portion of the Holy Ghost given to them. &gt;&gt; Father, that according to your prophet's message that they may uh be men that will uh take their office seriously, that they will do fulfill it and with friendliness. Oh God, &gt;&gt; Lord, I pray that you will put a spirit upon them. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; May the Holy Ghost and the spirit of wisdom be upon them &gt;&gt; that they may know how to act and what to do in certain situations. &gt;&gt; I pray, oh Father, you will infuse them, Father. Endue them, oh God. May it not be their thoughts, but your thoughts that are being drawn. We lay our hands upon them, oh God, that they might fulfill and discharge their duties in a godly manner. And I pray, Father, that the congregation will have a great respect for them. And not for them as men only, but for the God that has called them. &gt;&gt; Father, they have seriously prayed about this even for months before entering and and accepting the office. And we we have seen the sincerity of their heart. And you have seen it certainly. &gt;&gt; And now, Father, we commend them to you &gt;&gt; and according to your word, appoint them into this office &gt;&gt; as deacons. &gt;&gt; Yes, Lord. &gt;&gt; In the name of Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Like you just to remain here if you would please. I have a few things that I would like to say concerning the deacons and so that it will not seem strange to the congregation. I felt for a long time and we've discussed it in a number of deacons meetings even over the years that the deacons should feel free to pray for the sick and even elders. But deacons and brother Brandham has said this, divine healings in reach of every person. Every person that is a Christian has a right to pray for the sick. &gt;&gt; Do we say amen to that? Every Christian. &gt;&gt; Every Christian has a right to pray for the sick. He said, "That's right. And if there's any among you sick, call the elders. That's the deacons in your church. and they and and then if they confess their faults one to another and pray for one another in expectations, he said, "And you don't have to wait until somebody got a healing campaign. Don't have to wait uh uh to be healed because your pastor or your neighbor that's a Christian, everybody, anybody's got a right to pray for you." The Bible said, "Confess your faults one to another and pray for one another that you might be healed. And if there's any sick among you, call the elders." Now, we call them in our groups. We call them the deacons. Let them call the elders of the church. Let them anoint you, anoint them with oil. And I will say to you, brothers, you should prepare yourself and have a have a a bottle of oil. We use the olive oil, a pure olive oil. and let them call for the elders of the church and let them anoint them in oil. It's not it's not called the elder but the elders plural and plural two or three and where two or three are gathered together and agreed and they pray. uh that's the way to do it in early spiritual experiences and there were so many we weren't able to go into it all but he said not only preachers but the deacons and the and the lay members pray ye one for another every Christian in here has just as much right to pray for the sick as I brother Bosworth brother Baxter brother Roberts or any other man there is now we need to take that to heart everybody has a right but but it also says to call for the elders of the church and brother Brandham said that is deacons. Now in the prophet also taught that we keep order in the church and uh uh and if and if there are any that are disturbing. So there was a question is it sufficient openly from the pulpit that tongues and interpretation that was when gifts were being used in a disorderly fashion. And that's why they were talking about order. So I wanted to be to specify. And he said that's the second question. They had two questions and questions and answers on the paper. He said uh now this would be pertaining to the pastor here. The question of should there tongues interpretation. He said that's concerning that that that that's would be pertaining to the pastor because he after all over the spiritual part he's the head of that. But deacons are policemen in the church to keep order and to take care of these things and feeding the poor and so forth and the trustees over the financial finance of the building and that's what they look after but the pastors over the supervising of the spiritual part and this would go to you brother Neville he said at that time then on another question he said the deacons your duty is to keep order in the church with kindness and friendliness And then another place, how f how far brother Brandham can or should a deacon go to keep order in the church? Should we keep the order or wait until brother Neville tells us what we should do? And he said, "That isn't brother Neville's job. That's your job." Speaking to the deacons. And if a man's doing something wrong in here in the church or anybody's u or anybody, stop them. Talk to them. Don't be arrogant. But if they won't listen, uh speak in a way that they know that that what you're saying. Uh he said like I if I tell a child walk back there and he's misbehaving, deacons, he said uh deacons stay at your place. There's uh four of you in that church. There was four uh stay two in front and two at the back at these corners. So he's telling them where to position themselves. And then he said, "Watch real close for renegades." He said, "Surprising renegades do come amongst the believers." And he said, "Watch real close for renegades." Some of you may not even be aware, but these brothers have had to deal with renegades from time to time. And I could spend probably the next hour and tell you about a few that we've we've had. So, watch real close for renegades and everything else that comes in this. He said, "You see, and you be on guard and you get get to your post of duty and stay there. Uh, that's your seat or stand right beside a wall and watch everybody come in." Now, I'm going to just take up something while I keep the men, the deacon brothers, standing here because it's a it's a need in not only this church, but a need in perhaps many, many churches. And it's perhaps something you don't uh realize, but it's something that I want you to really take to heart. And that's this. There's far too much movement of people in this church. Far too much. And this will be perhaps a shock. Perhaps some don't move at all. And I realize there are those with children. They must move. They must go in. They must come out. So are those that are of necessity. And someone may be ill or sick or something and need to uh they need help or they need to go out and that is perfectly fine. Uh but brother Brandham said that each of us have a spirit and he refers to it many many times and so that uh if you move and distract you distract others it's not just yourself you distract others and it distracts the Holy Spirit because you have a spirit and God is dealing with other people and then there's this movement and unnecess I'm talking about unnecessary movement You parents, parents, you make certain that your child absolutely needs to go out and then you should actually go out with them and see that they come right back in because they go out and whether in the washroom or sitting out in the hallway or something that's this is the house of God. Amen. &gt;&gt; And something that I've noticed, it's almost become a habit and I'd like it to stop as of this morning. And that is when the brother finishes his message. And if we know the scripture, the scripture says, "And the and and then God, he confirmed the word with signs following." &gt;&gt; It happens after brother Brandham after the ministering of the word would call the sick and afflicted. And then and then he had the same problem over and over dozens of times and the people start to move and he'd say, "You're not to move. Don't move." Because that that disturbs it even disturbed him as a prophet in the in the ministry to the people because he'd say, "You have a spirit. You have a human spirit." And then he indicated one place if there's someone that's that's tending towards unbelief or maybe they've got uh some critical uh attitude or whatever more it seems to foster that. And then he talked about spirits jumping and going back and forth. And so uh when the minister's done preaching says let's just bow out and have a prayer. That's not the time for an exodus. That's the time to sit and pray that now the Holy Spirit. Take a hold of the word and confirm it to the people. Now, now we're coming to the real part. The word's been preached and we want to see there's somebody. It's not you and having to go to the washroom or something else or just go out. It's not possible that even all of that. This is embarrassing, but I I and I don't want you to think that I do this when I sit here, but I actually counted and I never counted nearly all the movement. I didn't count the little children going in and out. and one of brother and one of while brother Dodd preached and at the end of the service and I counted those went out there was a a hundred a h 100red bodies that moved in this church and that is simply not necessary I'm 76 and I very rarely ever have to go out and if you're got a physical problem come up here and we'll pray for you &gt;&gt; so you'll to be able to sit through the service. And uh and if you have children, you make sure as parents that they absolutely have to go out because a lot of times it's just an excuse and they just want to get out. And you young people are up in your teens, you don't have any reason to go out. Amen. &gt;&gt; And so I'm saying this while the deacons are here that we are to monitor that and make sure that that is absolutely necessary. And this is what brother Brandham said regarding that. He said don't move around. Now, everybody be real quiet just for a few moments. If you'll just give us the at least five more minutes, I'll be glad to dismiss it. But don't move around. It interrupts. And you see, when you do this, you and then he breaks when you're when you're dealing with the spirit of God, it's just so sensitive. Don't nobody be in a hurry. And please don't move around while the spirit of the Lord is at work. While it's moving, be reverent. &gt;&gt; Is this good instruction? &gt;&gt; This is absolutely essential instruction. And if you wonder why maybe more isn't happening in the service, a more supernatural, the the hindrance can be maybe right in the congregation. And we want to do everything. At least we want to say we did everything that we know to do. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And I would say at the end of the service, you go to prayer. &gt;&gt; You just start praying. You start you start leaning into the message with a with a minister. I don't care who you are. You just bow your head and be real reverend. Say, "Oh, God, come on the scene now. This word was preached for a purpose. Somebody needs to be touched. We want to see the Holy Spirit touch people's lives and be affected. And then when they go out, perhaps they're the very ones that need it. And when they go out, their lives will be changed. &gt;&gt; He said in in the message, Abraham, now be real reverend. I know it's getting late and many times I know it's getting late, but if you'll just stand just for one one more and don't move around, I'll appreciate it. You're a you are a spirit. If you wouldn't he you would be dead and your spirit sometimes when unbelief becomes so dense it hinders. So you're just talking about even the movement and if someone else is there and they're they're filled with uh unbelief and it becomes so dense. Maybe there's maybe there's a resistance to the word that's been preached. What he's indicating is that a movement disrupts the Holy Spirit and that person is is is uh uh doesn't get delivered from their unbelief. And that's the best way I can say it. And so I would like the congregation to know that we're officially saying this to the to you and we know that you'll respect it. I I sense and I feel a real acceptance and uh and whoever it is that's preaching. But I can tell you that I know that if a prophet of God with the angel of the Lord beside him needed people to be reverent and to be still and especially at the end of the service and if you know what someone says to me, oh a child was really disruptive in the service and did it bother you? Not a bit. Said didn't even hear it. That doesn't bother me. I think that parents are they're they do their very best and if they have to slip out well we have a cry room and a nursery and so we try to do that for you because I know that parents don't want to see their children disrupt a service. If you have to slip out and the child has to slip out, that's fine. But we don't don't don't train them that they just up and go and come back and then everything else and and so you young people, I've been in church all through my teens and we don't have to get up and move around, walk around. So we'll just be real real reverent. And when it's necessary, hey, God knows it, the Holy Spirit knows it, we know it, and everything's perfectly fine. So there's no added bondage to it. It's just respect. &gt;&gt; Amen. And the people said, &gt;&gt; "Amen." And the people smiled. &gt;&gt; Good. God bless you. &gt;&gt; All right, brothers, to your post. Amen. Still feeling all right? &gt;&gt; Good. I'll have you stand and I I want to sing that chorus to Word of God Ever True. Changing me, Changing You. [Music] Ever true changing me, changing you. I come with open hearts for let the word of God once again. Word of God, ever true, changing me, changing you. We have come with open hearts. Oh, let the word of God. I want to sing it once more. And you turn around and shake hands if you feel like it with someone else. Word of God ever true. Changing me, changing you. We have come with open hearts. Oh hallelujah. And let the word of God impart. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. And I'll accept the last line. You can sing it to me. Word of God. Changing you. Changing you. [Music] Heat. [Music] Heat. [Applause] We have faith. Oh, let the word of God impart. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; You can take your Bibles if you would please and turn to John's gospel the fifth chapter. [Applause] John's Gospel 5 and verse 19. and then answered Jesus and said unto them, "Verily, verily, I say unto you, the Son can do nothing of himself, but what he seeth the Father do." &gt;&gt; Like you to stress that, but what he seeth the Father do. For what things soever he doeth, these also doeth the Son likewise. &gt;&gt; Amen. For the Father loveth the Son, and showeth him all things, that himself doeth, and he will show him greater works than these, that ye may marvel. And then the 10th chapter of John, we'll read also at verse 18. Now, just before we read this scripture, I want you to be mindful that Jesus has said that that he does nothing except what the father showeth him. Brother Brandham said he saw visions, but also brother Brandham didn't always see visions, but what the father showed him, what he saw the father do, so doeth the son likewise. and he did nothing but the father showed him what needed to be done. I would like to include in that the father must have showed him Calvary who for the who for the cross and the suffering that was set before him he endured the cross and he embraced it. And so in the 18th verse here, he's speaking about his life. No man taketh it from me, but I lay it down of myself. I have power to lay it down, and I have power to take it again. This commandment have I received of my father. &gt;&gt; His father showed him already that he had power to take his to lay his life down. had power to take it up again and he was going to lay his life down and no man takes it from me. He said this I this commandment I've already received this of my father. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. When you know that friends, you have confidence. All right. You may have your seats. And when you do, if you'll open your Bible, please to the book of Exodus. I want to read in Exodus uh the 12th chapter and we're going to read concerning the Passover. And the Lord spake unto Moses and Aaron in the land of Egypt, saying, "This month shall be unto you the beginning of months, it shall be the first month of the year to you, speaking unto all the congregation of Israel, saying, In the 10th day of this month, they shall take to them every man a lamb according to the house of their fathers, a lamb for an house. And if the household be too little for the lamb, let him and his neighbor next unto his house take it according to the number of souls. Every man according to his eating shall make your count for the lamb. Your lamb shall be without blemish, a male of the first year. You shall take it out from the sheep or from the goats, and you shall keep it up until the 14th day of that same month. And the whole assembly of the congregation of Israel shall kill it in the evening. And they shall take it. They shall take of the blood and strike it on the two doorposts and on the upper doorpost of the houses wherein they shall eat it. I'll stop reading there and we just ask the Lord to grant us understanding of his word &gt;&gt; in Jesus name. How many were at the camp or saw the presentation that was done? And I believe uh brother Rickart was one of the senior men. Brother Matthew Ordeal was another one. And I saw Matthew and it was his responsibility to put the blood on the doorposts in such urgency and such How many saw that? How many? All right. And one of the things that uh uh impressed me while I was watching that and moved me it was very much a moving experience that he was taking with such desperation while others were laxed about it and you know well I don't know this household wasn't taken very serious but he is the father of this of his household he was taking it and with the with the hissup and was putting it on the doorpost and rubbing it so vigorous seriously on there. And the word that's used in the Bible is strike the doorposts. And I want to speak on today on doing the will of God. Uh doing the will of God, applying the will of God. And this is only I will only be able to introduce it today because there are so many subjects, so many things and parts of our life that need to be addressed. Uh the Bible is full, absolutely full of scriptures, far too many for me to even bring to you this morning that have to do with hearing the word of God or doing the word of God or doing the will of God. I have uh I have these scriptures which we have uh which we have read and I thought perhaps it would be good for us just to look at them again. Then Jesus said unto them, verily I say unto you, the son can do nothing of himself, but what he seeth the father do. For what things soever he doeth, these also doeth the son likewise. The reason I have brought this scripture up before you so we can read it again is this happens to be one scripture that brother Brham refers to all the time, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; Indicating because he he knew well that people wanted him to do things wanted if you can see a vision you can see a vision for me. If you can tell that person, you can tell me. So he was indicating that it could only be as the father. For the father loveth the son and showeth him all things that himself doeth. And he will show him greater works than these that ye may that ye may marvel. Jesus did what he saw the father do. He applied what he saw to his own life and walked into it. So it's not only seeing what should be done, but it is walking into it and doing it. &gt;&gt; Jesus saw Calvary, the suffering and the victory and applied himself to fulfill it. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He walked towards Jerusalem with a conscious decision. And even when others wanted to make him a king, he walked he walked willingly to his death. And it says in Hebrews, who for the joy that was set before him endured the cross, despising the shame and is sat down at the right hand of the throne of God. So he was not living his life just for the victorious part of it. He saw that in suffering and in paying the price, there was also this great victory. No man, no man taketh it from me, but I lay it down of myself. I have power to lay it down, and I have power to take it again. Th this commandment have I received of my father, and he that sent me is with me. The Father hath not left me alone, for I do always those things that please him. The Father have not. Now, if that was his case and Jesus Christ, this Jesus Christ is present, I'm only using terms that we use so often in the message and this Jesus Christ is expressing himself and is living in flesh again today, then I would say the same principles need to be in place. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The father that that has sent me hath not left me alone. &gt;&gt; Amen. because or for I do always not as I hear always or I see always I do always &gt;&gt; those things that please him. &gt;&gt; The character of Jesus Christ always does those things that please the father. Now to to do is are these things. To act rightly, to perform, to bring forth, to carry out, to do well or and to fulfill. Now, I want to tie this scripture to it. for the trial of your faith being much more precious than gold that perisheth. And brother Brandham talks about there is a gold of God. And the gold of God is a Christlike character. It's why I was referring to the character of Jesus Christ. I do always those things that please the father. &gt;&gt; It's not that I hear them, I do them. Not that I see them, I do them. I don't come to the synagogue and just hear it. I do those things that the father that pleases the father. And so the gold of God is a Christlike character produced in the fiery furnace of affliction. And that is the right kind of gold. The importance of applying what we hear is brought out in this great with great emphasis in the account of the Passover night in Egypt. And that's why that's where I tie the two together. So, we're speaking of the character of Jesus Christ, how we have his spirit in us. And if his spirit is in in us, that spirit is urging us to be doers of the word and not hearers only. &gt;&gt; And you said amen to that. &gt;&gt; All right. Now, you might it might take a moment for you just to uh connect these two scriptures together, but I I'm I'm sure that it will be this will be a meaningful service for you. The we're we're uh very very conscious today of all kinds of product and all kinds of equipment and all kinds of things. And I have to make a confession. I'm glad for the brothers that are around the office. You know, Brother Aaron, brother Darren, Brother Michael, and you know, Brother Tom. I call all these people all the time. And it's something that I and my wife, we have kind of going between us. She says, "I can't. This thing doesn't work. I did that, but it doesn't work. I punch those buttons. I can't make my Did I lose it?" I said, "You can't lose it. It's on the disc." You know, she always, you know, I said I said, 'Well, why don't you call Michael? You know, that's what these guys are getting paid for. Why don't you call Brother Aaron? They know. I don't know. I can't fix it, but just call them. They know. Do you know why I don't know? I'm I don't read very well. I mean, I can read. I can understand, but I've never been able to operate a camera. I just All those dials, they just drive me crazy. Amen. &gt;&gt; Do I have any friends here? &gt;&gt; Oh, praise the Lord. You're my You're bu buddies indeed. I just, you know, and if I have to read too much about how the computer and the thing works, and I'll never I'll never forget, you know, Brother Rod Bergen came over to my place when we had the first uh uh boat anchor computer and we managed to get this thing real cheap. and he came over to my house and, you know, set it all up and everything and and the thing scared me. I I was I So he sat back and okay, you turn it on and I I I turned it on and it, you know, didn't do something happened that wasn't supposed to happen. And I'm saying to the machine, I am sorry and he just roared because I was looking on the thing as something, you know, almost human. And uh and so then uh you know he went and every everything was fine. Now I knew exactly how to do it. And here's the book. And so I'm reading looking at the book. Okay. You push this button to start. I pushed it to start. And it says now you'll notice that there's a cursor at the upper left hand corner of the thing. And there was no cursor there. So I did what I do best. I dialed the phone. I I got brother Rod on the phone. Brother Rod, it says the second thing that was to happen is there's supposed to be a cursor at the top left hand corner of the screen. It's not there. He says, "Oh, yeah." He says, "They're always doing that." Well, you know, just don't pay any attention to it. So, I found that one of the good answers is don't pay any attention to a lot of the stuff. But on the other hand, a lot of it doesn't work. Do you know why? Because you need to follow the instructions. And if you buy a product, they will have on there the instructions and the more the more important uh the more critical I'll put the more critical the product, you know, if it's an epoxy and you have just a few seconds to put the two together and once it touches, you can't break it apart for nothing. it's a it's a crazy glue or it's some kind of an adhesive and you want to I I want to put this thing together and and you and it's real critical. Well, you you can't just say, "Well, you know what? I'll just uh I think I know how to do without the instructions." No, you need to read the instructions &gt;&gt; very carefully and then follow those instructions. The company is saying to you, if you follow these instructions, you will come out with this result. &gt;&gt; And a lot of us, we don't get the result because we don't follow the instructions. &gt;&gt; Isn't that the truth? &gt;&gt; With the word of God, you know, I'm just being honest with you now in this service. We don't see a lot of what we want to see because we haven't followed the instructions. The instructions aren't complicated there. It's the simplicity of it. You say, "Well, it's so simple." That's right. Just do it. &gt;&gt; Just do it and you'll find the blessing of God come right on behind it. And in this instantaneous, you know, this generation, we have instant this and instant that. And we want it right away. It doesn't happen right away. It's a life. This this walk is a is a whole life. [Music] I'll get to preaching after a while. &gt;&gt; Well, my wife and I, we got concerned about our weight. When you read things, you know that with every pound you lose 5 years or something. My goodness. Well, we then you we read some pretty scary stuff. So, I thought, well, we better, you know, do something. Okay. So, she got us all enrolled at this place and it wasn't a diet place. It was a medical place, medical thing. So, we go there and we sat there with some other people and not a whole lot of us, just a few of us. And they're telling us right away and they just they just put me in in the dumps immediately. They said, "This is not a diet. We're not going to tell you how to diet. This is a way of life. what you start now is what you do for the rest of your days. And I thought, oh man, I want something sudden. I want something to happen right away. I don't want to be told this has to carry on the rest of my life. And there was a big fellow. I mean, he was a big houseky and his his children made him come because he had had a heart attack and he was at great risk and he was a a monster of a barrelchested man. And and this woman came out and she had in her hand uh a a little piece of is some phony food, you know, and she said, "Okay, this are the portions that you need to eat in this new way of life that you're going to live. and and he was right in front of her and he said, "This is the portion of meat." That's a portion of meat that big around. And this guy probably, you know, he a 16 steak wouldn't do him any more than he needed. And and she had him take this take it and he took that little piece of meat and held his hand. And I could see if there ever was unbelief on a face, unbelief was on his face. There's no way that I'm gonna live the rest of my life eating this little piece of almost looked like a little piece of rubber. I told my wife of all whatever it cost, whatever you spent. I did learn the one thing that it's not it's not a diet that works. It's not something a quick it's not a quick thing. You have to set on a course of life. this life that we've entered into &gt;&gt; this message life, this word life. It's not even coming and standing here and somebody prays for you and you feel better. That's not it. &gt;&gt; You come to the front or in your own prayer closet and you make you do business with God and you intend to live live that direction the rest of your life. &gt;&gt; This is a way of life. It's not something you just put on or something. I go to church. I feel better. I talked to one one young woman. She she said, "Well, I she was Catholic. I go to church and I go to confessional every week. I go to confessional because I feel better." Well, she probably does. That's not a solution. The the the sad thing about that is that when she goes and feels better, Satan deceives her into thinking that that has something to do with spirituality. That has nothing to do with spirituality. You know, you can you can have a big row at home and then ball and cry and then say to each other, "Well, I'm sorry." You will feel better, but it may not be the remedy. &gt;&gt; You know, that may be part of the remedy, but it might not be all the remedy. We come to church, we hear things, we get happy, we feel good. It's not to this this place here isn't here to feel good. The message didn't come here to make us feel good. Brother Brandham even said when we come into when we become a Christian, that's when war starts. Then we're in a battle. We're in a struggle. But the word of God gives us the answer how to be victorious. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And there's a certain there's a certain pattern we need to follow. And that's what I'm wanting to speak about. And one thing is absolutely certain and that is that it that what we hear must be applied. And they shall take the blood. But prior to this, prior to this, I want to make some emphasis slowly. The source, the source of the instructions, you know, if you if you have a product, the instructions for application must come from the people who know the product must come from the people who know what it'll do, who who who has designed this whole thing. And God for the first time. Now we say and Moses and Aaron. Well, Moses, just remember, God had never had a prophet like Moses. &gt;&gt; This was a new source. &gt;&gt; This was a whole new thing with the people. They had not had anybody ever come down, not even Noah or anyone else came and said, "Thus sayaith the Lord." But now God has instituted amongst humanity a man that he's going to speak to. And that man is going to be required to utter what God has spoken to him. And he says, "Thus saith the Lord." No wonder that the messenger of this time. No wonder that brother Brandham made so many references uh to to Moses and the and even God when says you'll be given two gifts, two signs like Moses &gt;&gt; because that was when it was instituted. &gt;&gt; He was the first prophet. And now we have a last messenger to the gentile age. A last prophet messenger. Can you realize that? The last prophet messenger. They had a first one. We have a last one. And he was giving them specific instructions. Now I'm talking about success for your life. Young men, &gt;&gt; young ladies, &gt;&gt; young families, and all age groups and all situations. There there is a there is a success for a believer's life. There's no believer with this Bible in my hand that ought to live below what God has purchased for them. &gt;&gt; You are in agreement with that. &gt;&gt; We should not live below our rights. And I if I might not be attained to it, I will thrust you forward and say you believe. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And whatever God puts in your heart to believe, God grant it to you. Amen. &gt;&gt; But there are specific instructions. We cannot ignore the instructions and expect to have &gt;&gt; success. Amen. &gt;&gt; And so it went on to say, "And they shall take the blood, that was the substance, and strike it, not just strike it, but strike it on the doorposts and on the upper doorpost of the houses wherein they shall eat it." and then in and e Exodus also the 22nd uh chapter 12th verse rather 22nd chapter and you shall take a bunch of hissup now hissup was a common weed brother Brandham calls it a common weed and so I'm I'm I'm standing here and you're sitting there but I want to say when it comes to the application of of uh the redemptive uh the redemptive powers you have as much access to it as I do. &gt;&gt; And that is why God said just because the hissup was available to anybody. Hipup was just a common weed. And you take the hissup and you'll you'll dip it in the blood and you'll strike it on the doorpost. And so it's a wonderful thing the blood the blood they they they didn't have any access to manufacture the blood, but they could just take hissup a common weed. And that's why the Bible also says the common people heard him gladly because it's a common gospel if I can put it that it's not a difficult gospel. &gt;&gt; So this scripture in in Egypt is recording the first and only time God would deliver his children out of Egypt. He didn't have to deliver them over and over and over. He delivered them once. He had a process by which he would do it. And it is at this time, this first time that the Passover lamb I cannot stress the importance pointing right to Jesus Christ. The Passover lamb and the token are introduced as a type of Jesus Christ. the first and only time that they're introduced as uh or or rather that they he has introduced them amongst his people and they would remain as a foundation throughout all all the time. The blood. The blood. Now I'm coming to it. The blood had to be must be absolutely essential that it be applied precisely as commanded. &gt;&gt; If the blood was not applied, death came to the house. &gt;&gt; And if we have a bleeding word, would you agree with that? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You have a bleeding word. I have a bleeding word. &gt;&gt; The bleeding word must be applied according to the instructions. &gt;&gt; It has to be precisely according to the instructions. &gt;&gt; Someone will say, well, I can just get my own instructions. That's what a lot of people felt when the prophet of God, oh, he had all the healing ministry and all the supernatural and all the miracles and then finally he starts more and more saying, "Thus sayaeth the Lord, thus sayeth the Lord." And they needed to find a way to circumvent that. And I even read one of them. They said that uh you know that brother Brandham was he was just precise. He was right. of all the thousands of times he never missed once when he told the people uh the secret of their heart. But but don't hear him when he comes to the word. Well, that is the word. &gt;&gt; That is the word that was speaking. &gt;&gt; And he just couldn't fathom how theologians and wise men could could break the system. In other words, they say this is right. The instructions now are right. The word is absolutely divine. But when it comes to the word, don't agree with it because they already had all of they had all of their things all figured out and they had a different set of instructions. And I'm here to say to you and they didn't get the result. &gt;&gt; Because if you don't follow the instructions, you won't have the result. &gt;&gt; I find people in the message. I find people in the message. This isn't rocket science, friends. This is just simplicity. And the word of God is so simple for their life, but they don't want to do it. And they look around say, "Well, I'd like to have his life. I'd like to have her life." All you need to do is do the same thing and you'll have that life. &gt;&gt; Because God is no respector of person. If you do what they do, you'll have the same result. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And we had such a beautiful example in our Lord Jesus Christ, a perfect example and a wonderful example in the messenger. And and and you know this is really a surprising thing but I'm going to just say some things absolutely truthful. I've told brethren that have had responsibility within the church. I said whenever the the first responsibility of a pastor is to see she see that the sheep are not distressed. If the sheep get distressed, if you're distressed because the word is preached, well, that's something you can't do anything about. But if if something is taking place in the church and the sheep get distressed, and I I I've written emails and sent word and just said the responsibility of the shepherd is to do everything in his power to see that the sheep aren't distressed. And if something comes in and starts to float through the church or something and it you see the people get unsettled or something, I've always gone back to the message &gt;&gt; to find out what the prophet messenger because I always felt that that was the example &gt;&gt; and and a good example is is the is the music for example. Sometimes you you know everybody's taste is different. someone like this kind of music, someone likes another kind of music, someone likes, you know, something else. But and then uh and and with some people, I mean, they just say, "Well, I just can't stand that. It just irritates me, whatever more." But if I go back, I always like to put my back against the message. &gt;&gt; And then when I hear the prophet say, "I I love those old songs." Well, it wasn't it wasn't because he was old. Some of those songs were brother Brandham was only 56. He was in his 40s and his he he's a youthful man who said I love those old songs because it wasn't the song. It wasn't the melody. It was what the word said. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And I love I love those songs that that speak about it is well with my soul. &gt;&gt; My sin not the part but the whole. I like the words of those songs. draw me nearer, nearer, nearer. And how many times he says, "We're here to get nearer to God." And my soul says, "Yay, amen. I want to get nearer to God." Oh, blessed be the fountain. Blessed assurance, Jesus is mine. And I like to put my back against that. You know, a lot of the songs today are generic. They don't even talk about Jesus and the blood and the cross and those things because they want to find a a a a a they want to find a popular place in the broader community of called Christianity and it's called contemporary. I'm not interested in contemporary. I'm interested in the oldfashioned gospel of Jesus Christ. I'm just interested and that might just be me. But but and yet I I like a beat. I like rhythm. I'm made for it. Now, I played guitar and I like those what they call hot licks and all those things, but I wouldn't get in front of the church and do it. I just, you know, because it might stumble or offend somebody, but at home I I might just play it. Unfortunately, don't get to play very often anymore, but uh I I like rhythm. I like movement. I I see some of these people, I go over to over into Africa and and I see them dancing around. I thought I I look at them, I say, "Man, I wish I could do that. I just wish I could just get feeling so free. And and I I'll never forget down in Cape Town once and the people began to rejoice. I believe it was brother Eddie Layman. He's gone on to be with the Lord now. I think they were singing this is the day. This is the day. This is the day that the Lord hath made. And there was two fellows. One was about 10. There were two brothers. One was about 10. One was about 12. And they just got lost. I mean, they were just lost in God. They were singing. They were rejoicing. They both just moved out and danced out in front of all the people. But they they weren't they didn't care about anybody. &gt;&gt; They were just enjoying it. &gt;&gt; You want to do it that way, that's fine with me. &gt;&gt; That won't bother me at all. But when it comes down to our, you know, to our uh our our conviction and our redemption, and I like to sing about it. I like to rejoice about it. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen. &gt;&gt; And so the token must be applied precisely as this is commanded. We have to follow the instructions. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; And this is a bleeding word today. So many want to take the message and just pick and choose what suits them. We don't want to do that. &gt;&gt; We want to. So you're saying, "Well, where are you going, brother Ed?" Well, I'll tell you where I'm going to be going in the future. I want to look at certain aspects, certain things and say this is what the word of God says. &gt;&gt; This is what the messenger has said. And I got news for you. This is what works. &gt;&gt; Nothing else works. This is what works. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; A lot of times, a lot of times it runs in real conflict with the flesh. &gt;&gt; And we all have trouble. I don't have to worry about you. I have my own flesh to worry about. And to make this man do what it's supposed to do is not easy. Sometimes it's a very difficult thing. But I know in my heart it's the right thing to do. Sometimes it just kills you and it needs to kill you. &gt;&gt; You need to die when it happens. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I'm really thankful to have as much response as I'm having. I thought it was going to be awfully quiet here, brother. &gt;&gt; All right. Now, the token must be on display, visible for all to see. It's not something that we just did and generated in our minds. &gt;&gt; It's not something we think about. &gt;&gt; It's not something we learn about. &gt;&gt; It's something that we do. &gt;&gt; We don't say, "Well, we have to learn more things." And you know, we could get the instructions of of a certain product and say, "Well, I think I'll go on Google and find out what the world thinks about it or I'll find out what somebody else thinks or I'll find about those that used it." I'm, you know, I'm not opposed to that. But when it comes to the word of God, we don't have to go searching around see, well, what do you think about it or what do you think about it? God's already said what he thinks about it. &gt;&gt; When God speaks it, we don't have to go asking for someone else's opinion. say, "Well, I heard it." Okay, now I'll get someone else's opinion about what I heard. And brother Brandham has said in one place, I've got the quote here, "You've heard enough." &gt;&gt; Jesus couldn't have said it any clearer. He said it very clear. &gt;&gt; And when the Holy Spirit came into the church and they said, "Men, brethren, what must we do to be saved?" Yes. &gt;&gt; He didn't say, "Well, now we'll go through great dis dissertation here about what you must do." It was just one word. Repent. &gt;&gt; Oh, that's hard on the flesh. &gt;&gt; But repent. &gt;&gt; Turn around. Have a change of mind. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And be baptized. &gt;&gt; And you shall be filled with the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; Amen. Now, in the token message, I've got a number of quotes from the token message. The lamb was killed in the evening time. Not somebody say, "Well, I think I'll do mine in the morning because I'm going to be busy tonight." It'll be killed in the evening time and kept up for 14 days. And then the lamb was killed and the blood was applied in the evening time. Now, this has special significance to us. I trust I'm able to get it across. Special significance because the token message. I don't know if any of the other messengers or people or apostles preached on the token message, but if you take and I would I would actually ask that you would get the token message and read it after this service because we have more services coming. But the token had to be applied in the evening time. And to me, it's very significant that God who ordained Moses to come and one of the first things he does is institute the Passover and apply the blood. You must apply this. In other words, their life changed. &gt;&gt; They were physically doing things they had not done. I've never gone out to my sheep, to my little flock, and picked the best to kill it. I've never done that. And to put the blood on the doorpost of my what are my neighbors? What are the people going to think? I've never done that before. But now they're doing something different because a prophet said so. And that's the only thing they had was what he said. &gt;&gt; Well, he said it &gt;&gt; and I did it. And then they and then that that presentation that they did, it was, you know, the son, the eldest son. Are you sure? And brother Brandon goes through it. Are you sure? Father, daddy, are you sure? Are we sure? Cuz I am your eldest. And the eldest is going to die if it is not done right. The only thing he could hang on, he had to hang everything, his household and everything on what that messenger said. And to me, it's very significant that in this end time came another token message by a messenger who said, "This is a bleeding word." Now, I've never heard anybody say, "This is a bleeding word." The word is bleeding because he said that because the word is Christ. &gt;&gt; This message is another doctrine, friends. This message isn't what the Pentecostal, the Baptist, the Presbyterians. We don't we we're not interested what anyone else says. We have a thus sayaith the Lord. &gt;&gt; We have a proven message &gt;&gt; and a proven messenger. We're going to give an account if we have a disagreement with his. We're going to give an account at the judgment &gt;&gt; over the thousands of times that God spoke through his mouth and revealed the secrets of the heart. And God is going to say, in fact is God doesn't have to say anything. We're going to stand there naked. I trusted. I don't plan to be there by God's grace because if there's anything I love, I love I I love that vindication. Why? Because the vindication was beyond a human. &gt;&gt; It wasn't William Brandham. &gt;&gt; He was only a vessel. &gt;&gt; He just a vessel of clay. &gt;&gt; He's a sinner b born in sin &gt;&gt; and saved by grace. &gt;&gt; But God spoke through him. Amen. &gt;&gt; And we can't even dispute. I don't have to substantiate that, you know, any more than I have to stand here and say the rock of Gibralar is steadfast. I don't have to say that. It is what it is &gt;&gt; and he is what he is. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And we are what we are. &gt;&gt; We've been called here for this season. &gt;&gt; I I trusted this will be a a life-changing message for you. And he said the token never come into existence until the evening time. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It could only come into existence in the evening time. It they had an evening then and you'll kill the lamb in the evening. You'll spread to put the blood and you'll stray it on the door. You're not just doing this, you know, in some uh haphazard casual way. You're going to take that basin of blood. You're going to take that hissup and you know that this is life or death and I'm going to put it on the doorpost and make sure that it's visible and make sure that everybody can see it. I'm going to do with all my zeal and all my energy. God's prophet said it. I'm going to do it. &gt;&gt; Applying it. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And the blood was applied in the evening time. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Said this is evening time for the church. Amen. &gt;&gt; This is the evening time for me. He said, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; This is the evening time of my message. &gt;&gt; He's placing it right in time, friends. &gt;&gt; It was evening time that the message came. &gt;&gt; Evening time. Brother Bren says, "Evening time for my life." And in 24 months, he's gone. &gt;&gt; He knew it was evening time &gt;&gt; and he was dealing with it as seriously. This is the evening time of my message. She says, "I'm dying. &gt;&gt; I'm going. I'm moving out in the evening time of the gospel." &gt;&gt; Have you heard those things before? &gt;&gt; I'm moving out. &gt;&gt; In the evening time, that's why he was approaching it with such a seriousness. &gt;&gt; He said, "In the evening time, the message is to apply." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The evening time message. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hear it. The evening time message is to apply &gt;&gt; the token. &gt;&gt; We hear that word. It's not a phrase, apply the token. It's a life. &gt;&gt; It's something we do. &gt;&gt; It's not something we hear Sunday morning, Wednesdays, or whenever. We do it. Our life is changed. Amen. &gt;&gt; And it keeps changing because we keep hearing &gt;&gt; the word. &gt;&gt; The applied word or the applied token for this hour is the very identification. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; That you are accepted in the beloved. It didn't it wasn't an examination of the man and what he had done or the woman of the house or whether they had maybe just had the biggest fight they ever had. When he put that blood on the door, God had said, "I'll pass over that &gt;&gt; when I see the blood." &gt;&gt; Not when I've examined you and looked you over thoroughly or the house or how it happens. When I see the blood, when I see the blood, not your blood, but the bleeding word. When I see the word, I'll pass over you. &gt;&gt; Is that God's word? &gt;&gt; Should this people rejoice over that one? &gt;&gt; You're never going to make your flesh &gt;&gt; acceptable to God. It's when he sees what you believe and what your desire is &gt;&gt; that he accepts you. &gt;&gt; When I see the blood, I'll pass over you. &gt;&gt; There isn't anything in this world, friends. There isn't anything in this world can make you acceptable in the sight of God. &gt;&gt; Nothing. &gt;&gt; Three things. And this is paragraph 26. He said, "Notice God's preparation for the time." First thing he done to his people was send a prophet with a message. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; That was first. We're reading the instructions now &gt;&gt; for application. &gt;&gt; Praise God. Amen. &gt;&gt; The next thing he done was to identify this prophet. &gt;&gt; Amen. to send a pillar of fire for identification to identify it. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; So, we're sitting here today. &gt;&gt; I'm just asking you now. We've got a lesson. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Are you satisfied? &gt;&gt; I know you are. You're satisfied. This is a a word prophet. &gt;&gt; You're satisfied with that? &gt;&gt; Everybody satisfied? &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. Are you satisfied that that pillar of fire, you've seen the picture, you've seen the angels of the Lord, you've seen pictures of Houston, you've heard him say, "He's here." &gt;&gt; All of those things accumulated. Are we satisfied as a congregation? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That the message has been identified &gt;&gt; by the pillar of fire. &gt;&gt; Say friends, we've come up the ladder. &gt;&gt; Yes. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Then we're satisfied that what he says and what what what he speaks is God speaking to us. &gt;&gt; God instructing us. &gt;&gt; We're this is not a man. Now we're satisfied. We're following through the instruction for application. &gt;&gt; And now are we satisfied then that when he said this is a bleeding word. Are you all satisfied on the pl on the up in the balcony? Are we all satisfied? This is a bleeding word. Then I say to you that is the blood. &gt;&gt; You don't have any other blood. &gt;&gt; There is no animal. There is no bird, no human blood. This is the blood. There's no other book that bleeds. &gt;&gt; There's no other word that bleeds. There's nothing in chapters or indigo or any other place. There's nothing on Amazon that bleeds. &gt;&gt; This word bleeds. [Applause] &gt;&gt; This word was crucified again. &gt;&gt; Jesus Christ. This is blood. &gt;&gt; And if you apply it, &gt;&gt; apply it. &gt;&gt; It will it will give you the results. &gt;&gt; To deny it is death. &gt;&gt; I'm confident of that. to deny the word. That's why I tremble. &gt;&gt; It's a simple thing. &gt;&gt; I sit in an office or I speak to somebody or send them an email and say, "This is what the messenger said." He said, "Well, this brother Brown said this, you so and well, we maybe see it a different way or someone else." You be careful you see it as he sees it. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; You don't have to say it as I see it, but see it as he sees it &gt;&gt; and do what he said. Not hear what he says. do what he said. [Applause] &gt;&gt; We've heard enough. &gt;&gt; We've heard even more than enough. &gt;&gt; We need to do &gt;&gt; what he says. &gt;&gt; And the third thing he sent was the token. The first thing, the first thing he did was send him a prophet. &gt;&gt; The second thing he did back then and today, was to send the vindication that what the prophet said was the truth &gt;&gt; and that the pillar of fire was in attendance. So now we're agreed we have a prophet. We're all agreed that it was a vindication message by the presence of almighty God by the supernatural. And then the third thing is that he sent a token. He sent something to the people that they they could do but they could not bring the result for themselves. In other words, the I if they applied the if they applied the instructions absolutely correctly, then the death angel passed over them. &gt;&gt; God did not require that they attain some great height or achievement. &gt;&gt; He just said, "If you'll do this," and he put it within anybody's grasp, everybody's grasp. There isn't anybody here, you can't say to me, "I can't do it." There isn't anybody that can say I can't do it &gt;&gt; because it's just hissup. &gt;&gt; Are you a common man, a common woman? &gt;&gt; We're just common. &gt;&gt; This message is to us. &gt;&gt; You can do it. &gt;&gt; I can do it. &gt;&gt; It's hard sometimes. Sometimes it's a struggle to get this flesh to subject itself. And that's where the problem is. To get this flesh to say, "Yes, &gt;&gt; I will do it. Amen. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; So, he sent a token to get under this blood and he and he'd accepted this substitute death in your place. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And then the blood was a token &gt;&gt; that he looked at at you that's heard the message, &gt;&gt; believed on the pillar of fire. You've heard the message &gt;&gt; and believed on the pillar of fire &gt;&gt; and had accepted the substitutionary &gt;&gt; that he had provided for you and you were under the blood of the very chemistry of the life that went out for you. &gt;&gt; God. Amen. &gt;&gt; How are we going to pay for how are we ever going to pay for how could we what could we do in this life to hear the words prophet vindicated. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Pillar, fire, presence. We see it. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And now we have him say, "But you didn't do it in the first place." I tell you what, when I first read those words, it was a real tough one for me because there's something in the human psyche that, you know, we want to, you know, make ourselves responsible or we want to make ourselves guilty in a way. We want to make ourselves, you know, so we're held responsible. There's one thing that you can't be responsible for, and that is for your your total justification. You can't be, you can't justify yourself. &gt;&gt; You can't glorify yourself. You can't resurrect yourself. You can't do those things any more than any more than the children of Israel could. We could say to them, "Save yourself." &gt;&gt; They couldn't save themselves. &gt;&gt; But just the shedding of blood saved them from the number one power of the earth at the time, the superpower we could say, which was Egypt. Okay. The token message. I think this little phrase, these are phrases that are not difficult for you. Apply as instructed. You must read and follow all these instructions before using. I just took that off of some product. I don't even know what it was. You must you you you've read it. &gt;&gt; I see you smiling. You're all you're all in the basket with me. &gt;&gt; You must and if that is on some solution or some glue or something else, surely it applies to this. &gt;&gt; You must read and follow all instruction before using a person. You know we can we all have been in these places. Now I want to just be at at a very very simple level. You can read some instructions before you apply. Read these instructions. So you come each Sunday morning and you say, "We're going to hear something more about the instructions. We're going to hear more instructions, but we didn't do last week, but it doesn't make any difference. We just I just want to hear more." &gt;&gt; Oh, we got a special speaker and he's going to give us the instructions from a different angle, from his perspective. Oh, it's going to be wonderful. Oh, it make us so happy. Oh, I heard how these instructions have worked for people in China and worked for people elsewhere. Work for We get all enthused about it. We hear how Brother Gary Walker, you know, we say, "Oh, isn't it wonderful?" And and we just heard the testimony. I I can't be the same person. But I was talking to brother Tom, talking to my wife. How many How many have the Brother Gary Walker's book, The Testimony? All right. You want to get it? He told me one of the most difficult times was when he was in therapy. You know what is difficult about therapy? You have to do certain things. &gt;&gt; If you don't do it, and that's why the nurses and the therapists and whatever more say, you got to stand up. Stand up. Stand up. Move your arm. Move your fingers. Do something. Brother Gary told me that if he could move in the months that he was in therapy, he struggled with everything that was in his being to move his foot a half inch further than he had moved it the day before and move it a half inch. That's one day. Come back the next day. stand there and hang on to those rails and try and do everything to move the foot a half inch, half inch, week after week and month after month. So, we see him come up here and stand and open up the Bible and oh, I just rejoicing just a second. We all ought to go back there. &gt;&gt; We all ought to been back there because you can't really taste what it is &gt;&gt; until you've been through it. And sometime we have here we are in strong healthy bodies and we we all we have to do is make our way to the service and and it's such a struggle and oh come on folks &gt;&gt; are you with me? You understand what I'm saying? It's not difficult to come to church. It's not difficult to be here. It's not difficult to apply apply what God said when he when he and he he gives our life you know he gives instructions for our life. It's not for our detriment. It's for your benefit. there's a blessing coming in behind it. And then the denominational world got in behind it on giving. One of my one of the sessions will be on giving. I won't tell which one. So, make sure everybody's here. &gt;&gt; But there's a promise on giving. &gt;&gt; If you give, it'll be given back to you. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; There's a promise with tithing. There's a promise with giving. There's a promise with offerings. There's a promise with all that. But then the denomination world got on it and talked all about the promises. Oh, you'll be blessed. You'll be blessed. That's not the idea. &gt;&gt; The idea is God said it. The pillar of fire vindicated it. He said a prophet and this is the bleeding word. And I just do it. &gt;&gt; I do it whether I get anything in return or not. I just do it because it may not come back materially. It may come back in health. It may come back in family. It may come back in relationships. It may come back a thousand ways. [Applause] &gt;&gt; It may just come back that you feel wonderful every day. You feel encouraged every day and God has drove back that devil of discouragement and held it away from you and you don't even know about it. You just feel wonderful. &gt;&gt; It might be because you were just giving. You're just tithing, doing what God said to do. He said, "Just do it &gt;&gt; and you'll be blessed for it." &gt;&gt; Amen. Right. &gt;&gt; That's just one small one. &gt;&gt; And then you hear it. You hear some instructions. You don't need to go and research it. Well, I think I'll research it and see if there's a a different way that we can approach it. You can read the testimonials and the successes and the reports of what the product has done or done for others and you can hear about that it's absolutely true but that doesn't do anything for you. You know it's us that need to do it. Amen. &gt;&gt; Paul said in Corinthians, "But we preach Christ crucified. Unto the Jews it's a stumbling block and unto the Greeks it's foolishness." And he didn't come up with another phrase and say, "Well, then what's the use?" It's just foolishness to these people and it's just, you know, uh, what do he say? It's a stumbling block to some and it's foolishness to others. But we preach Christ. He didn't say we preach about Christ. &gt;&gt; We preached about his background. We preached about all the types. We preached about all the beauty and the types. We we bring it from all angles. We preach about the conditions of his time. No, we preach Christ. We just preach the word. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And then it's up to the people what they do with the word. &gt;&gt; In Philippians, he said, "Some indeed preach Christ even of envy and strife, and some also of good will." So here here's Paul writing. He's saying, "Well, some preach Christ to envy and some preach Christ uh of strife, but and some also of good will." So he's saying this isn't affecting us. what what this one does or what that one does. Somebody says, "Oh, well, the message church in Toronto is this or the message church in Phoenix or in Dallas or in some other place." It's not up to us to say what they are doing because it's Christ. This is simple and I keep going back over it. We are We are convinced. We're convinced God sent a prophet. were convinced that the pillar of fire was in attendance &gt;&gt; and were convinced he gave a message in utter simplicity. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The applying there's two or three words. I'm not going to keep you late but there's two or three words that are used in the used in the scripture and used in our English language. We can say applying or the word that I was using first appropriating appropriating the word and brother Brandham refers to that to appropriate faith. It's not that faith isn't here but to appropriate the the promise is here. And then another word is comprehending and I want to connect these two together for you in just a couple of minutes. Now, so when the Hebrew said uh the Hebrew scripture said strike the doorpost and that is to put it upon to set it, you know, there was there's no other explanation for it. You just put it on there. A man had to take his energy, had to take his lamb, had to follow the instructions and put it on. and the death angel passed. So many references uh we hear the references all the time to apply the blood. The word applied is doesn't appear there but it is it was to forcefully strike it on. Now in Matthew's gospel Jesus tells an account and we believe his words are true. He's speaking to you and I. &gt;&gt; And he said, "Not everyone that saith unto me, Lord, Lord." So it's not what we say. We may be here declaring, "Lord, Lord, I love you. I believe your word with all that's within me." We have to be careful &gt;&gt; because I've seen a great weakness within the message and I'm trying to deal with it. Not just here, but within the message where people they will they will declare emphatic they're ready to die. Brother Bam was God's prophet. Do you believe the Do you believe that he stood before the people and you believe that when the secret of their hearts were revealed it was God? Absolutely. Absolutely. And they will come to a place and they hear what the message is saying. And everybody has something different. You know, it might be with some with their work, it might be others with their finances, it might be with others with their relationships, might be with others with their family or it could be a whole lot of things, different things. And but there comes a place and we need each one. Each person needs to focus on that one area that gives us some difficulty. And we want to say if we want to build a real successful life, we need to say I will do it. &gt;&gt; It's just that simple. I will do it. &gt;&gt; And the mind will go into reasoning right away. Well, you can't do it. you'll be looked on this way or you'll be looked on that way or you can't do it financially because of this because of that or you can't do it because they'll think that you're weak or for all kinds of reasons and the mind is so active will go into it or what will my friends think. I know I I I I relate to young men a lot because when I see you and I shake hands with you, I immediately put myself back when I was about your age. And uh I remember very clearly, you know, some real smart dressers. I was working in a store and I was selling clothes and I was kind of conscious. I wanted to, you know, to appear right because I was before the people and and these three fellas that came into town and they, you know, they were stylish, real stylish. They had the narrow pants at that time, zoot suitors with the big chain. They're all going back to it about now, you know. And I'm just seeing reruns actually. And they were about my size and they were about my age. And hey, you know, I had a I had a free going conversation with them and all the rest of it. But there was always this twinge. And this is what I want to say to you. Every one of you that are here in this church and have listened to this message, if you will just stop for a moment, way deep down there's an inner witness. And when you go to do something, even though your friends and everybody else is doing it, there's a little something down here saying, you know, you know, it's not for you, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; And so I didn't I didn't preach to these guys and say, "Oh, you guys are rotten. You're going to hell." No, I I was friendly with them. They were good friends, but they wanted me to, you know, well, participate in this and participate in that. Then I found out later that's just when drugs were coming in and these boys were taking it into town moved some young ladies and they were out, you know, and their their their their swingers, their shakers and movers and all the rest of it, you know, and and uh would try to start up a conversation with me because I was in the store. But my conversations with them were very very limited. Not because I was some big hero. I wasn't a preacher. I was I was I was one of you. But there was something inside that just said, you know, I'm not of that. I don't have that. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; And then a friend of mine from school d I'm just giving a whole bunch. I got a car and he got a car and he pulled up beside pulled up beside me says I'll drag you. Well, you know, the flesh was like, "Yeah." You know, but there just I thought, "What do I want to drag him for?" There wasn't anything in here. I didn't I didn't have any interest in dragging him. I might have been able to win. I don't know. I did a lot of silly things, but but I'm just telling you that there's an inner witness. You have it. &gt;&gt; You actually have it. &gt;&gt; And then when you get older, the inner witness will say, you know, oh, here's a here is a magnificent opportunity for you. and you're going to go places and you're going to earn this and you're going to this is where you're going to end up. You're going to end up on top of the stack, &gt;&gt; but deep down inside there's a little witness &gt;&gt; that says that's not for you. &gt;&gt; That's not the direction. &gt;&gt; It's not mom or dad or the church or the preacher, the prophet or anybody else. It's the Holy Spirit in you. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Giving you a witness. Amen. &gt;&gt; He's protecting you. &gt;&gt; This is the blessing of God. &gt;&gt; And might be on the other hand, it'll be the other way. Say, "Go for it. Go. You'll I I got something in I got something for you in this direction." &gt;&gt; Can I take just a couple more minutes? But five minutes. So Jesus said, "Not everyone that says unto me, Lord, Lord, but but he that doeth the will of my father which is in heaven." And many will say to me in that day, Lord, have we not prophesied in th name? Didn't I go to church? Didn't I go to Cloverdale Bible way in thy name? Didn't I sing the songs? And didn't I do all the things? But he says uh in my name and cast out devils and in my name done many wonderful works and then I will profess unto them I never knew you. That's the secret of the relationship. See depart from me excuse me you that work iniquity. Therefore whosoever heareth these sayings of mine and doeth them, I will liken him unto a man a wise man which built a house upon a rock. And the rain descended and the floods came and the winds blew and beat upon that house. Oh my, the all all the things happened. Maybe sickness came and maybe accidents came and and financial meltdowns came and the loss of this and the loss of that and it blew upon the house and and it fell not for it was founded upon a rock. What was the rock? It was simply hearing and doing. &gt;&gt; That's all it was. The rock was simply hearing and doing. Not only hearing, but hearing and doing. That combination. And everyone that heareth these sayings of mine and doeth them not shall be likened unto a foolish man which build his house &gt;&gt; upon the sand. And the rain descended, the floods came. Same situation, same conditions. So the believer and the unbeliever. Are you with me? Amen. &gt;&gt; The believer and the unbeliever, the young man, the young woman, and the believing and the unbelieving, the families, believing and unbelieving. &gt;&gt; They are they're subjected to the same storms, the same things. There's sickness here, there's sickness there, there's financial matters here, fin relationships here, relationships there. This is the only answer that I have in this world. And it and the key is the key is do it. &gt;&gt; Just do it and it will work. Listen to that inner witness and do it and it will work. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I'm going to close just with testimony. I've been I've spoken some personal things, but I I had a I had a buddy and I mean we were more than buddies. We stayed together. He stayed in my room. I lived out at his mom and dad's place every weekend out on the farm and he was just about one year younger than me and we were as close. We were so close. I've maybe told you about by the younger ones wouldn't have heard. And he was built he was built like a o ax. He was so strong at 15. You know what a railroad tie is that's under the railway. At 15 years old, he was carrying the green ties from the mill to stack them. That was his work all day. At 15 years old, I mean, he was strong. But he he he didn't hardly speak. He was real real quiet. So he'd say to me, "Treat me like Aaron." But he wasn't Moses. But he'd say, "You know, you do the talking. I'll hit him. which we I never never got into that, but that's the kind of person he was. You do the talking and I'll hit them. God help anybody he hit. They wouldn't see stars. They would see planets. But we were in a meeting. We were both we're both kind of half, you know, backsliden and, you know, just being silly and not doing anything bad, but we just weren't living for God the way we should. and playing around in the world and nothing bad just you know being two young guys and we we knew the way I knew the way his mom and dad were Christians and mine also but I wasn't my parents I was already working we had a service I'll never forget it and I was I was just sick I just sick of you know if you're a Christian listen to me young people there's nobody as miserable As a miserable young person who knows the way and isn't living it, &gt;&gt; you're just miserable. You can never fit in the world. &gt;&gt; Don't let the devil ever tell you or tempt you that you can fit in the world. &gt;&gt; You'll never fit in the world. &gt;&gt; You'll be utterly miserable. &gt;&gt; And I was miserable. And he was too. And this night there was a service. I don't know who spoke. I don't know. But I was under such conviction and we both just came down to the front and and surrendered our lives. The very next week he went to a dance. The next Saturday night he went to a dance and I was so smitten. I thought, you know, we both we both started out together. We both went to the altar together and and and as far as I was concerned, it was over. I just gave my life to God right then and there and that was it. And he went to a dance and it wasn't long. Now watch the process. Wasn't long and had a girlfriend and wasn't long and he had a baby and then maybe got married to her. I don't know what happened. And then he had to work. He was doing work and he was out of the city and they had another baby and he said, "That baby isn't mine. I'm not the father of that baby." That was a position he took and I will not support that baby. And trouble trouble came. He just had more trouble. In the meantime, I'm just our two pathways just went straight like this. I had the same battles. I had the same bills to pay, same everything, same work. Had to work every day, slug it out, have good days, bad days, all the rest of it. But my heart just bled for him. And his father was an elder in my church. And he was like a to me, he was like a before we even came to the message, I looked on him as as a spiritual father. He was just a wonderful man. and he taught me how to hunt and he was just a man of the wilderness. He was a wonderful man. You'll meet him, &gt;&gt; brother Guy Haney. You'll meet him. And we'd walk through the woods and and and he wasn't interested in hunting and I really wasn't. I wanted to always talk to him about we'd talk about the rapture. We'd talk about the we talk about what God is doing. And and God used him, you know, in and he'd say, "Well, you have a certain desire for God." And I would say, "That's right, Brother Haney." Well, you know, God is God has got his hand on you. And he encouraged me along. And I saw a man of such faith. I was working with him one day and he was driving a nail, had his hand on the corner of a board and missed his nail and hit his thumb and split his thumb right open. And oh, and he just he took his handkerchief out and wrapped it around it. said, "Lord Jesus, you know, just heal this." Took his handkerchief off and his thumb was healed. And we're both standing on a scaffold. And I I can't hardly believe it. He just carried on working like nothing happened. And I I had such an mad admiration for him, such respect. And this was his son. called a son up in in court and sentenced him to six months in jail for not supporting this child, which he was sure was not his. And he had to go to jail for 6 months. Brother Haney, this dear brother, in the winter time, he dug graves. He dug graves for a living and had to burn tires. Are you listening? had to burn tires so he could make the ground soft and dig this grave. And he said to me, he said, you know, he said, this judge sent my son to jail. He said, and I I knelt down. I prayed, if his decision was right, you let it stand. If it's not right, remove him from his place. In two weeks, this man dug his grave and buried that judge. That kind of contact with God, I admired it immensely. But even the son that he prayed for, that son just went the way of the world. And one day at 35 years old, healthy as a ox, he came home. his wife who he was with then was another woman and he said just have a I'll just have a sandwich or something. Had a little bite to eat. Said I think I'll just lay down on the sofa. He laid down on the sofa and his heart stopped and he was gone. And they did an autopsy and told his brother who's a very dear friend of mine who was actually a deacon in our church. They said, "What happened? what was the cause of death? And the doctors just said his heart just stopped. We don't know why. Totally healthy man. His heart stopped. And I have I've have that and that's my experience. He was my buddy. He was as probably close to me as anybody. But when as close as we were, when that next week came and I had prayed and he had prayed, but when the next week came and he said, "I went to a dance." That is when that little witness inside. We're on two different roads. &gt;&gt; As close as you are, you got friends, I got friends. You got associates, I got associates. But when they go one direction, you have to choose another direction. Watch me young fellas. &gt;&gt; I'm talking right to you. You got to make a decision. &gt;&gt; You got to apply your life in another direction. &gt;&gt; And it'll work. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; And if you don't listen to that witness, it won't work. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I felt so much to speak to this congregation this morning on applying the word. And I won't read the quote. Brother Brown says, "You've heard enough." You know how much we've heard? We've heard just tons of messages. &gt;&gt; We've heard all kinds of it. And now I say to you in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ. Just do it. &gt;&gt; Just be the wise man. &gt;&gt; And you fellas, you'll never regret it. Young ladies, you'll never regret it. Say, "I stood for this word." &gt;&gt; Regardless of what anybody and I tell you, I took I took it. I took such a serious place with the word. And I began I I entered into a love relationship. I love the word. Oh, I just love the scripture. I love the Bible. That's why it touched me. Brother Danny, we said, "You got a Bible." And you just started to love God more. I just loved it. I didn't know anything about a prophet. Didn't know anything about Malachi 4, but I just love the word. Just open the word up to me. Open it up to me. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; My father, was a godly man and we were apart most of our life after my mother's passing and only once did he give me a scripture that I remember and I leave it with you and you young people you can write it down and if you have a Bible that I signed this is the scripture that will under it. Just listen to the words first. He that hath my commandments and keepeth them, he it is that loveth me. And he that loveth me shall be loved of my father and I will love him and will manifest myself to him. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I was a teen brother James when that my dad and it it like branded my heart. Little did I know that years later, years later, then I I didn't know I was living in the very age that he was revealing himself. &gt;&gt; And I read the scripture and read the scripture and held it in my heart. He that hath my commandments and keepeth them, we do them. He it is that loveth me, and he that loveth me shall be loved of my father, and I will love him. Oh, I thought that's so wonderful. I will love him and will manifest myself to him. Will you just bow your head with me? And I want to invite you. You may feel something very deep just now. Feel and sense the Holy Spirit speaking. You may want to just lift your hand. lift your heart, Lord Jesus. I want this kind of relationship. I want to be loved of you. I want to be one that doesn't only hear you. Oh God, oh God, grant me grace to do what I need to do. Maybe there's some of you here that know, you ought to say something. Perhaps there's something you need to go to someone and make it right. Or you need to take a stand. You need to be very clear with your decision. Don't leave it, young man, young woman. Don't leave it, my brother, my sister. Don't leave it. Do what we need to do. And God will bless you for it. God will bless your home. Bless your family. We'll bless your witness. We'll bless your testimony. Father, in the name of Jesus Christ, take I pray this group of people in the atmosphere that we are in and we want to say only you, Lord. Only you. You're the only fountain that we can run to. You are the bleeding word. You are the one, Lord Jesus, for us to for us to be here in this sanctuary today. and those that are streaming and for us to try to comprehend and take into our into our mind, Lord, it just almost we're incapable of doing so, but we're attempting to try to understand, Lord, your grace, the depth of your grace, that you would send such a word as we have, such a message as we have, and to realize that mankind hasn't had this all through the centuries, all through the generations. And here we are. Oh, such a privileged and honored people. Lord, work deep. Speak deep. I pray, oh God, that lives will be transformed, changed, changed. Oh God, word of God ever true, changing me, changing you. May we Lord uh come under the uh under the impact of the Holy Spirit at this time, at this moment, Jesus, as you're drawing near, I pray you'll touch our lives, Lord. Touch my brothers and sisters, their homes. And in this time, Lord, that it's not an easy day. It's not an easy age we live in. It's difficult. I pray that you will be very, very near. I'm asking Lord, you be very near. These people are so precious to me, to you. And I ask for all believers, oh God, that are that you have called your children, wherever they are, wherever they're fellowshipping today. Lord, not only those that are streaming, but those that are fellowshipping elsewhere. I pray, oh God, that your Holy Spirit will move near to them and bring a people to yourself that will do your word. Not just hear it, but do your word, oh God. Those that are seeking you, those that love this message, those that love your messenger, oh God. Father, you will look kindly upon them. And I pray that you will do your your supernatural work in all of our lives in Jesus Christ's name. I ask it and thank you for it. And if there's someone here, Lord, whose soul is still away from you. They do not have the assurance of salvation. They do not know that they have eternal life. If they're one that you have called, oh God, maybe this be the moment that they will receive you, Lord Jesus Christ, as their substitute, as their sacrifice, and they will discover their names are on the lamb's book of life. We pray, Father, you'll grant this. Do so, Lord Jesus. Work amongst us, oh God. I pray. Will you pray with me, saints? Each one of you, we pray that his will now will be done at the closing of this service. Pass me not, oh gentle savior, brother Ryan, please. [Music] Pass me not. Oh gentle say, I know, Lord, it's true. I know it's true. you. Oh yeah. All right. And while [Music] others thy do not pass me by. Oh, save [Music] my cry. [Music] And while on others, thou art called. Oh, do not pass. Let's all stand together, shall we? Oh, Savior. Hear my humble cry. and while on others thou are called. [Music] &gt;&gt; Oh Savior, do you not pass me? [Music] &gt;&gt; I'm going to be dismissing the service soon, but I don't want to dismiss it. Well, I know in my heart that God is speaking to individuals [Music] and some perhaps I don't know every heart, but some that just have not been able to surrender. You've not surrendered. I think of brother Tim Dodd's words. Don't miss it. Don't miss your opportunity. once again in this service has taken a strange direction for me, one that I did not expect and God is doing it for a specific purpose. And if you're here and you need prayer, I'll be so happy if I'll tell you what. Do it whatever it takes. Do it whatever it takes. I pulled out of my seat. I came down to the front. Not because there's anything more holy and sacred down here. I wanted to do it. I wanted the people to know. I wanted the devil to know. I was leaving the ways of sin. I was surrendering my life to the Lord Jesus Christ. And I was making a conscious decision. I was wouldn't allow anything. If my friend came, if he didn't come, I was going. I heard the master call and I was going and I if you're here and you're in that state, uh some of you on my heart, I have specific ones on my heart and I'm speaking to you. I'm I'm drawing all the forces of heaven sending the angels of God. Send them, Lord, the Holy Spirit. And cause them to be persuaded, not almost, but fully persuaded. This is my hour. This is my moment. This is my time. Grant it, Father, in the name of Jesus. Lord, whoever you're striving with, may they surrender to you at this moment.

You don't have to feel emotionally moved. I would prefer that you didn't feel emotionally moved but that you just said I am going to make a choice &gt;&gt; for the right way for the right direction. There's nothing lost. There's nothing wrong. But you have to do business with God and say I am laying my life all that I am and all that I can ever be. I'm laying it down for God today. And God will honor you. God will honor you. I don't know what the blessing will be. That's irrelevant to me. It's God's way. It's God's best way. It's God's only way. &gt;&gt; Hear the word of God and do it. And do it. Just say, why don't you say to yourself right now? I will do it. &gt;&gt; I will do it. &gt;&gt; Let me hear it again. &gt;&gt; I will do it. &gt;&gt; You mean it. &gt;&gt; I will do it. Speak my Lord and I will do it.
