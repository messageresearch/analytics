Because we are believers, Lord. &gt;&gt; We're believers in your supernatural power. We're believers, Lord, in a prophet. Lord, we're not believers in this cosmos of this world, Lord, that's quickly fading away. We're believers in the supernatural, Lord, that you can change hearts, Lord, that are once going astray. You can change lives, Lord. You can change situations at the preaching of your word, Lord. Chains of bondage can be loosed. the captivity can be set captive this morning. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. We believe this morning, Lord. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. As we go to prayer this morning, it's good to have our brother Ernie Villa back. We'll just have you come and pray over the requests. Brother Ernie, we do have a couple of testimonies. How many believe that the Lord is your healer? &gt;&gt; Sister Ella Joy believes that the Lord is her healer. She came up for prayer. It's the other service. The Vanenter family would like to give God praise for touching Ella. Last Sunday, we took her up for prayer as she was in a lot of pain after having a cast removed to stretch her muscles for about 3 weeks. She has had no pain from that time on. &gt;&gt; Amen. We believe this is just one step closer. Hallelujah. Praise the Lord. It's the full restoration &gt;&gt; we're believing for. Amen. Thank you all for your constant prayers. &gt;&gt; Sister Karen Hendrickson believes in the healing power of God. &gt;&gt; God bless you, Sister Karen. She came up for prayer after facing an illness that brought her to the point of death. She is healed. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. I don't think we can overemphasize it, friends. Amen. I don't think we can overemphasize it. We do want to pray for several requests. Um Rebecca Hegman, please pray about her employment situation and that she can Yes. So that she can get free of the situation that she is currently in. Amen. I believe that God will honor that request. There's a brother in Siberia by the name of Boris who uh is a minor and he was in a severe mining accident was nearly crushed to death and the doctors give him about 2% to live. So that's where God steps in. Amen. I believe we can pray this morning with faith believing in our hearts that God will answer prayers of the saints and though he has many that are praying for him in Russia and around the world and we just want to join our hearts with them. want to remember the believers in the Philippines from the recent floods in just the last week or so. And uh brother Ernie, I'll let you read this testimony. God bless you this morning. Boy, it's good to be back into this wonderful supernatural presence. something that uh it's it's so real each time you come back when you've been away for a while and you walk in those doors and you just know that you've entered into a place where where saints have prayed and you can just feel it's like walking into the Holy of Holies. I'd like to thank you each one of you that uh has prayed over the past few months for my uh my stepdad who's passed away and my mom who's now home and she's doing she's doing very very well and uh had an opportunity to speak. We had uh two memorial services, one at the funeral home and the other one at the military service, which was uh was quite dramatic and uh I was just amazed at how many people my stepdad touched along along the way, the years of all of us children growing up and the friends that he made and the friends that he had at work and it was just an awesome privilege to be able to speak to friends and relatives that I had not seen for a long time and not to be in a Catholic setting because he was not a Roman Catholic as most of my other family was. And uh they just gave us total freedom and liberty to be able to speak the word on two occasions and there was some very very dramatic results. And then I had opportunity to go to New York and uh speak at several assemblies there. And uh one thing happened, it was so supernatural. You know, there never had been anybody that I'd ever met who was in Rhode Island that that was in the message. And while I was there, just coming back from the funeral service, I got an email and it was from a brother Matthew. And I hadn't heard from him for so long, but he was an associate pastor of a church down in Boston. And while I'm sitting there in my mother's home just after the memorial service, he sends me an email and says, "Brother Ernie, I just want to inform you that there is now a lighthouse here in Rhode Island. Me and my family and one of the family have moved here and we have established a church and they're going to go on radio and uh they have a a great desire to reach out that little the smallest state in the union with about a million people there." So, and then I called him right back and he says, uh, I told him, I says, "Brother Ernie," he says, "Well, how are you calling me on a 401 area code?" He said, "That's the area code I'm in." So, I told him that I, you know, why I was there and the circumstances that had passed and we met and had some wonderful fellowship. And so, please pray for that uh that small assembly that's uh starting to grow in Rhode Island. And again for the saints in the Philippines, they've gone through some very very tragic events over the past week. Some flooding has just uh inundated several of the the the churches and uh many people were were lost and sent many of them are still missing. But as far as we know, some of the believers were injured, but as far as we know, there's been no casualties. But some churches have been devastated. So please keep those in your prayers. Let's bow our heads. Father, we thank you for this great supernatural symphony that you have sent to us in this day. A symphony, Lord, that that we can have confidence in. We can take it as an absolute because it comes from a supernatural realm. Came from the voice of a vindicated prophet. Lord, we just thank you for that confidence for for thus saith the Lord. when we open that that that message book or listen to the voice, Father, we know that we are hearing from you and and all things are working together for your good. Father, we know that you are going to cause in this last day supernatural conditions to squeeze the bride into the position for a rapture. Father, we're all trusting. We're all waiting. We're all believing on that, Father. And Lord, for those who have put their petitions in for prayer, we thank you for the testimonies. We thank you for the healings that we have heard for Sister Karen and and uh for brother Boris. Lord, just read about how his body was crushed in that mining accident. Lord, just pray that you would raise him up as as a as a testimony to the believers in that area. And Lord, for for uh Sister Rebecca Hegman, Lord, with this need that she has, I pray that you would open the windows of heaven, Father, as she goes out looking for employment, that you would open the right door for her to walk into, that she would be able to organize and position her life in a in a way that would be pleasing to you. And Father, we thank you for for for the the opportunity to be with believers, to be with such a a wonderful loving family of God. Ones that pray for each other, ones that love each other, ones that recognize the filler of fire that is lying inside of each person. Lord, we thank you for all the workers and the laborers in the church, Lord, and in the school building. And Lord, the those that clean the church, those that that that play in the musicians, for our deacons and our trustees, Father, the ministers, Lord, we just thank you for for such a a wonderful a wonderful supernatural existence, a life, Father, that that that is so far above, a love beyond our wildest dreams has come to us. Father, let us fully embrace it. Lord, let us fully manifest that life that you would have us to live. Lord, I pray that the hunger and the thirst for the word of God would grow greater and greater. And Lord, our desire to reach out. We thank you for Brother Matthew, Lord, and for all those that are reaching out to the to the lost that are on the streets of Vancouver and Bellingham and all over Victoria. Father, thank you for Brother Kyle and the labors that he's doing. Lord, we pray for brother Timothy and brother Murphy and the works they're doing overseas. So Lord, we just thank you now and pray that you would come this morning. We've come expecting our hearts are are in great anticipation that you will speak to us the very words that we need to hear. Pray that you bless our pastor, Lord, and as he comes, let him have just a freedom and a liberty, Lord. Let everybody be on the edge of their seat, Lord. Let everybody enter into the service, Lord, with their amens. Father, we just thank you for this great and grand privilege that we have to stand here, knowing there are many thousands around the world that would love to be sitting in the seats that we're sitting. But Lord, you've ordained for us to be here, and we want to take full advantage of that. &gt;&gt; We ask it all in your precious, holy, and wonderful name of our Lord Jesus Christ. Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. God bless you this morning. You may have your seats. Amen. Amen. Once again, we want to say God bless you and welcome all those that are visiting with us and pray for those that are away. Keep them on our hearts. Some are just starting the vacation season and some are at a wedding up in Edmonton. So, we want to say God bless you to them. The choir's got a special force this morning. Why don't they come and get ready? We had a wonderful report from the the new facility and location down in the Reon Tuck Willis Seattle area. The first service they had on Friday evening. Brother Tom Tuk and Brother Murphy's going to be speaking there this evening. So, we're just real happy and real excited for the saints down there and be able to have a new place to fellowship in and meet at. Amen. I don't think I had any other announcements here, so we'll just have the choir sing and we'll turn the service right to our pastor this morning. God bless you.

I was going to have you come up and give greetings, but you have done so. We I know that many of you have been praying for brother Ernie while he was away and uh taking his stepdad's funeral service. I certainly was praying for you, brother Ernie. And so happy you were able to visit a number of churches there at the same time. Amen. quite a number of our people away today. But uh um God doesn't take any holidays. I'm glad he's here. If he wasn't here, we'd be in a real fix. If he wasn't here, we better all take a holiday. But he's here. Amen.

And when the battle's over, we know where it come. Yes, we shall wear and we shall wear in the new Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Well, praise God. &gt;&gt; I'll have you turn in the scriptures to Romans the 12th chapter. And uh while we're reading the scriptures, you do what I've been doing for a couple of weeks now and just say, "God, uh step in in a special way and help me &gt;&gt; to grasp uh the revelation of your word. Help the minister to speak &gt;&gt; and give me ears to hear." &gt;&gt; Amen. And and I believe all will go well. I want to feed. &gt;&gt; And I prayed that the great shepherd would feed the sheep today. &gt;&gt; When you feed and have a good meal, you're strengthened. You're comforted. Amen. Just before we read, we'll pray. Father, I so thank you for this group of people that have gathered, for all that are with us and even saying amen that are streaming. all that may ever hear this service, Lord, that you would have ordained it to go and to them to their personal walk, their personal life. I pray, Father, that you will inspire us with a holy divine inspiration. I ask that you'll give utterance, oh God, to my lips, that they'll cause them to say just what you'd have said. There's somebody here, Lord. There's some some one of your children, your sons and your daughters, and you want to speak to them. You want to become very near to them today, personal. You want to touch them. You want to give uh them supernatural strength and virtue. And I pray, oh God, that this service will be a supernatural service. Lord, touch every life. Rebuke the enemy, our foe, your archeneemy. Rebuke him, oh God, and bring him down. And may this service, Father, I pray in eternity it will go down in record as having a victorious effect for the bride of Jesus Christ and a great defeat for the enemy. This is our prayer in Jesus Christ's name. We surrender ourselves to you now completely and we thank you. Amen. All right. In Romans the 12th chapter, you're going to read verses 1 and two. I beseech you therefore, brethren, by the mercies of God, that you present your bodies a living sacrifice, holy, acceptable unto God, which is your reasonable service, and be not conformed to this world, but be ye transformed by the renewing of your mind, that you may prove what is that good and acceptable and perfect will of God. I have a second reading and it'll be in Genesis the 3 chapter. We'll begin reading at verse 4. Chapter 3 begins and tells us the how subtle the serpent was, more subtle than any beast of the field. And he asked Eve the woman whether they could eat of the trees of the garden. And she had answered that they could eat of the trees, but you shall not touch, neither shall you touch the uh but the fruit of the tree which is in the midst of the garden, you shall not touch it. And verse four, and the serpent said unto the woman, ye shall not surely die. For God doth know that in the day you eat thereof, then your eyes shall be opened, and you shall be as God's, knowing good and evil." And when the woman saw that the tree was good for food, and that it was pleasant to the eyes, and a tree to be desired to make one wise, she took of the fruit thereof, and did eat, and gave also unto her husband with her, and he did eat. You may be seated. You may wonder how these two scripture readings fit together. Well, they obviously have to fit together because it's Christ from Genesis to Revelation. So, nothing is nothing's different, but we just need to uh have have understanding. And I would like to say that when we go back and we read about the two trees in the garden, I want to I want to lay a lot of emphasis on the symbols of the tree of knowledge of good and evil and the tree of life. and you pray that God will give you personal your own personal revelation of how that's to be interpreted in your life because uh uh I can tell you that the the tree of knowledge of good and evil represents a power to conform to a power of influence to cause people to conform form and the tree of life is the power of life to transform. &gt;&gt; And so the two scriptures which we have read in Romans be not conformed &gt;&gt; but be transformed. They go right back to the two trees. One is the power with influence to cause the people of this day to conform &gt;&gt; and the other is the power to transform and they're completely different. I want to lay a lot of emphasis on the power of transformation but also uh this scripture be not conformed. I just have a couple of uh slides here that I want to bring to you. Conformed is to make or be like in form or character. to act or be in accord to act or fashion in accordance with current customs and modes or we could say fashions. It is to conform oneself to another's pattern. &gt;&gt; Conformed describes what is transistory, changeable and unstable. &gt;&gt; And I think that you need to Really keep that in mind. To be conformed what is con what has been conformed to describes what is transistory transitions. It just it's it's transistory changeable and unstable. And the reason for that is because the world is in a constant state of flux. &gt;&gt; It's constantly changing. &gt;&gt; So styles change. medical science, all sciences change and we are called upon to conform to those changes &gt;&gt; just to keep moving. And so it keeps people in a state of constant, you know, it really adds to the rat race if you want to put it that way. Everything changes, styles change, uh automobiles change, everything changes. Uh the whole tech the whole world of technology is changing so fast that you can scarcely keep up with it. &gt;&gt; You might as well say amen to that because that is the truth. And you'll get some object and have it for a few months and then it'll tell you it's just a boat anchor. &gt;&gt; You chuck that and take it to the recycle bin because it's not useful anymore. That is being conformed. Transformed however is is something different. To be transformed is to give a different form to to trans it was the same word that is used be ye be transformed is in in Matthew the 17th chapter when Jesus and took his disciples Matthew uh Mark I'm sorry uh Peter, James and John on the mount of transfiguration. And the Bible says he was transfigured before them which is the same same word. It's to alter in disposition and it or to convert and that uh the the to be conformed doesn't convert a person. It just kept them moving from one state to another. Now, brother Brandham in a message at the towards the end of his ministry in 1964 in God's power to transform this quote here and everything under control to bring forth its kind. When he put the seed in the earth, the seed can only come forth with the power of life within it to transform it from seed to a plant. Now, that's not converting it uh in that sense of the word or it's not just changing its appearance. It's taking the life that's actually in the seed and bringing it forth to another form. &gt;&gt; But it's the same life all the time. &gt;&gt; Amen. And whatever it was, his transforming power, God put the seed in there with potentials that it would be what he said it would be. And that's key, that it would be what he said it would be. That all of that potential is in the seed to be what he said what he said it would be. And what he said was before it was seed. He spoke before it was seed. And then what he spoke the seed had to bring forth because he had said it he said it out of his own desire out of his own thoughts. And uh and incidentally I'll just say because I'm going to come to it. You have before you were born God had already not only given thought but spoke a seed word or a word seed that is actually he ties it to your soul. That's why you've craved you crave something the world could never satisfy. You crave something religion could never satisfy. You crave something that just uh just a message formality will never satisfy. It'll never satisfy it because your soul craves for something further because God spoke it &gt;&gt; in the beginning. And as long as it stayed in its right category, it would be just exactly what God said it would be. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And each one of those seeds has power in itself to transform itself. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That seed life that's in you doesn't depend on your efforts. It depends on and it doesn't depend on how grand the church might get to be or the music or anything else. It doesn't depend on that. It depends on the craving of the soul. And God has put in that soul to transform you, transform itself into what God had in his mind in the first place. It's already resident there. All the potentials are there. And what you are experiencing spiritually is the product of that potential. &gt;&gt; I feel I want to really make that a a very important part of it. So power in itself to transform itself into the species that I desire it to be. Now let me just stop there. The prophet speaks of a super race. And I know that when he says that you might feel, well, I don't really feel very super. I don't feel I'm part of a super race. That has nothing to do with that. &gt;&gt; That has absolutely nothing to do with it. You can't dilute the word of God. You can't make God's word less powerful than it is. I mean, when God thinks something and he speaks something and he says, "And it shall be." There's no way to change that. That's what you're going to be. You're predestinated to be that. And whatever he ordained you to be, the best for for you to do is to agree with him. &gt;&gt; Say, "He said through a prophet's voice, it's a super race." All right. That's a good enough for me. It's a super race. And then the devil comes around, wants to point you to this and point you to that failure, point you to something else. You can just say, "Get behind me. Get behind me, Satan. I don't care what weakness you point to. I don't care what failure you point to. I don't care what you to point to. This is what has been declared by God. And that's exactly what it's going to be. &gt;&gt; And I possess the potential. If I what I'm lacking, I already I already have what I'm lacking. &gt;&gt; I already possess what I'm lacking. You already possess it. &gt;&gt; What you're lacking. Would you agree with that? &gt;&gt; All right. That's what it must be because I have given every seed transforming power to make out of itself in in its potentials. now to make out of itself exactly what I want it to be. God has never changed. Just the same today as he was then. God is determined to do something. He He'll do it and nothing's going to stop him &gt;&gt; in God's provided way. In the Garden of Eden, there were two trees. One of them was the tree of life, the other the tree of death. or the tree of knowledge. And when man left the tree of life to eat from the tree of knowledge, the first bite he took, he separated himself from his maker. There's two trees, two seeds, &gt;&gt; two natures, two destinies, one to life and one to death. &gt;&gt; And that's where I'm wanting to go. &gt;&gt; Amen. I turn the lights back on. So that's why I feel it was necessary and we needed to go back to Genesis to get the uh to get the setting for being conformed or not be not conformed to this world. And this world is a changing world, rapidly changing world. And so if you if you decide to conform to it, you young people here, I can tell you if the time should go on and the Lord Jesus terries, by the time 20 years goes by, this world will be pressuring you to conform all the way along. &gt;&gt; And the colors will change and the styles will change and the fashion will change and the automobiles and the boats and everything else. the housing will change, building materials will change, everything will very very few things. Brother Brennan even pointed out, he said, "Now, if if you, you know, if you use the same medical uh the medical treatment of a 100 years ago, uh they they think you're crazy, you know, pull a fingernail or something and bleed you a bit to get rid of something and tell you they didn't know anything about, oh, they're making such advancements. Uh I heard a man I heard a man on the radio. They were interviewing him. He was a uh really an advanced in the medical world and the research and they asked him what do you see 20 years from now? Well he said that's hard that's very very difficult question to answer. But he said what about operations without blood? And the the announcer, he's startled. He says, "Pardon?" He said, "Yeah, how how about operations without blood, without any bleeding." And so, I mean, he's going way out there where even the man who was asking him couldn't know. How do we know what's in the future? We we we if we just look back, no wonder no wonder the prophets were considered mad. &gt;&gt; Insane people &gt;&gt; because what they were prophesying about our prophesying about the chariots jostling in the streets and all. Well, you're you're in the chariots right now. &gt;&gt; You're the one you you you you call it a gridlock. Uh that isn't what they call it, but that's what you call it because things have changed and and and we've conformed along with it. But be ye not conformed to this world, but be transformed by the renewing of your mind. &gt;&gt; So you get the mind of God instead of the mind of the world. Be transformed. &gt;&gt; And the power that's in you, all you have to do is believe in it. &gt;&gt; You do you do that? I'm sure. All right. In the garden was these two trees, two trees, two seeds, two natures, two destinies, one to life and one to death. And Jesus said, now the tree comes in physical form. He was the tree. He Jesus said, "I'm the way. &gt;&gt; I'm the truth. &gt;&gt; I'm the life. &gt;&gt; He's the tree of life. &gt;&gt; And no man cometh to the father but by me." Now the reason I want to just I I inserted that scripture there is because between the tree of life and the tree of knowledge of good and evil here and over in Revelation is only the tree of life is because God the word became flesh and and he didn't just become flesh. Watch it closely now. He He died. He went to death. He took that body of flesh to death, which was the sentence. But he gave it a resurrection. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That was unheard of. &gt;&gt; Others were brought from the dead, &gt;&gt; but Jesus Christ had a resurrection. &gt;&gt; He had a different body. &gt;&gt; Others came back from the dead, but they lived out their life and died again. But he came back from the dead and was resurrected. Elijah was translated. But but Jesus died &gt;&gt; and was resurrected &gt;&gt; and was transl trans transformed into another body &gt;&gt; and he showed that be on the mount transfiguration. He was transfigured. He was transformed which is the same word be ye transformed &gt;&gt; by the renewing. Be ye transformed. And and it says that we will have a body like unto his glorious body. Listen friends, this is a you might say, well, you know, if we always put things up in the future, our future is the brightest future. &gt;&gt; We can't look back or even looking to the future here in this world, it's not a pleasant it's not a pleasant thing. Look at the world today. I don't want to even get into it. It's a total chaos until I received a letter just a day or two ago and a brother says, you know, he says, "It seems to me we're in a tribulation. &gt;&gt; Everywhere you look, there isn't good news. It's a tribulation. The world is in a convulsion. &gt;&gt; Even the earth is convulsing. &gt;&gt; And the pollution and all of these things is just a convulsion. And the prophet said, the prophet has already said it can't it can't afford it can't take or handle a third birth pain. He said it will bring it right into a new heaven and a new earth. Amen. &gt;&gt; So one had to come in between between Eden and between Revelation with mortal life and then he took the death paid the penalty crushed the head of the serpent and that's why in Revelation you don't find the tree of knowledge of good and evil anymore. He's gone. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. He's gone. Rejoice all ye saints that believe the word of God. He's gone. You won't have him to contend with anymore. &gt;&gt; You want some good news? That's good news. &gt;&gt; That's the gospel. &gt;&gt; He's not there. And he's not there because the tree of life from Eden became flesh. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And took the penalty. He stood there while they ate from the other tree. He stood there and he took the penalty and crushed the head of the serpent. &gt;&gt; And he's he's not in existence anymore. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; So the tree of knowledge versus the tree of life. &gt;&gt; The good in the tree of knowledge. &gt;&gt; The good in the tree of knowledge. &gt;&gt; It's a tree of knowledge of good and evil. &gt;&gt; But the good in the tree of knowledge is never to be compared with &gt;&gt; the life from the tree of life. There is good &gt;&gt; say I'm I'm a hunter. Lots of brothers here are hunters waiting for the hunting season now. So they'll take their bullets which come from the tree of knowledge. &gt;&gt; The gunpowder in them the prophet even said come from the tree of knowledge. because he'll go out and he'll say, "Well, I'll go and get myself an animal and I'll get some meat for my family. That's good." But then the same bullet goes and kills a man in war &gt;&gt; and it's evil. So a man will take, he's not sinning if he takes up his gun, but don't forget it came from the tree of knowledge. &gt;&gt; And it's not a sin when he buys a box of bullets. But just remember it come from the tree of knowledge, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; And he goes out and he gets his animal and he brings the meat home. That's fine. He's fed his family, maybe fed guests and whatever more. And it's good. But he said, well, you know, the tree of knowledge, the life from the tree of knowledge always has to control the tree of I mean, the life from the tree of life has to control the good in the tree of knowledge. &gt;&gt; And he says, "Well, you know what? Uh, I'm just going to get away a little early. I don't really care to, you know, I don't necessarily need to be in church anyway and I'll go hunting on on Sunday. Now, that's not good. &gt;&gt; You know, this might be symbolic, but you're going to it's going to get so down to earth. You say, "Can't we have something deep?" So, there's all kinds of things. Well, uh uh you know the the life from the tree of life which we have in us needs to control our our daily activities. You in education, you in your jobs, you in your business, you in your off time, you in your vacation, you in your relaxation, whatever more. The tree of life needs to control that. &gt;&gt; And the tree of life needs to in infuse you with the gift of discernment so you can discern between the two. And sometimes it's not easy. Sometimes it's not easy. You really need to have the gift of discernment. Now, some of these things you may know. Some of these things you may have never heard, but in the Ephesian church age, brother Brandham says, "Religion and the spiritual world are made of those two trees which had their roots in Eden. Both the tree of life and the tree of knowledge of good and evil stood in the midst of the garden and no doubt no doubt their very branches intertwined with one another or with each other. He says the church is made up now the church is made up of good and bad. Two vines make the church. They are like the wheat and the tears growing up side by side. But one is the true and the other is the false. Now God will speak to each one and he will talk about each one. He will call them the church and only the elect will really know which is the true spirit. Only the elect will not be deceived. Right. Amen. &gt;&gt; Now, that's one you really need to say amen to. That's one you need to if you want to. It's it's Ephesians church ages 92-3 the paragraph. So he said no doubt their branches intertwined each other. Now I I want to bring something out very quickly here. I have it further in my message, but brother Brandham talks about the corn, stalks of corn, and while he was out walking one day, he sees a branch that is tore off in uh it fell off of a tree and it fell across a stock of corn and how that corn struggles. Now, he's talking about a corn, true corn, being deformed. Yes. &gt;&gt; You see this is what happens if we a real son and daughter of God. They can come under the influence of conformity and the power of conformity until the until the author until Satan himself causes a deformity. But he said yet it's still corn. Right? &gt;&gt; So now it's not just true or false, but a true one can can come under a deformity. &gt;&gt; Become deformed because but if you lift that branch off, if you get rid of that thing that's causing the deformity, then it'll come back straight again &gt;&gt; because that's the power that's in the seed. Amen. &gt;&gt; So the two trees now also speak of relationship. &gt;&gt; They speak of relationship because they they speak of seed as well. So the two trees speak of relationship. Before Eve received the seed of the serpent, she had refused the word of God because God had already spoken. And that was God's seed word. &gt;&gt; He had already spoken. So she turned that down and turned her ear this other way and she refused the word or the seed of the tree of life. She had accepted uh this is from a quote from the end time seed sign. She had accepted a seed of unbelief. And I've I've used that phrase seed of unbelief before I even know that brother Brandham had used it. So I want you to pay real strict attention. She had accepted a seed of unbelief against God's word because it produced something to her more brighter &gt;&gt; and she wanted more knowledge. &gt;&gt; And then he said later there was a defilement in the womb of her thinking &gt;&gt; before it was in her physical womb. It was in the womb of her thinking. a defilement because she'd already started turned from uh from the commandment of God to what the serpent was telling her and and Satan himself was speaking through that being. &gt;&gt; Is that too much for you? I'm sure not. &gt;&gt; So, there was a defilement of the womb of her thinking. Just a little later in the same paragraph, Satan the serpent got to Eve before Adam got to her. that's in Satan's Eden. So, in a in a sense, both trees have seed. Seed is associated. There's a relationship. They both symbolize a relationship. Now, they both symbolize a seed &gt;&gt; because they both have a seed. One is the seed of unbelief &gt;&gt; and the other is the seed of the word of God. &gt;&gt; Amen. And so further in the Ephesians church age said before Adam ever had coral knowledge with Eve the serpent had that knowledge ahead of him and that one born of it was Cain. &gt;&gt; I'm going slowly deliberately. I would like to have had this all up but I didn't want you just to be reading ahead of me. So that one that was born of it was Cain. Now listen to this. This is startling. Cain was born of and he says begotten of that wicked one. According to first John 3 and2 Cain who was of that wicked one, the devil. &gt;&gt; Now and now this is against those who can't see the serpent seed. Just listen to this. Cain was a born was uh was of or born of or begotten of that wicked one. 1 John 3:12. The Holy Spirit in John could not in one place call Adam the wicked one &gt;&gt; if he was Adam's son. &gt;&gt; How could the Holy Ghost call Adam the wicked one? for that is what he would have that is what he would be if he fathered Cain and in another place called Adam the son of God &gt;&gt; according to uh according to Luke 3:38. So he couldn't be called the son of God in one place and called the wicked one in another place by the same Holy Spirit. You understand then the Holy Ghost is the author of this word. I tell you, you know, the serpent seed is a very powerful and very fundamental and is a pillar truth not only of the message but of the of the entire gospel. &gt;&gt; And you'll that's why it was blood from Genesis right through to Revelation. That's why they had to be circumcised. They say that circumcision had something to do with the uh with the cleanliness. That had not it had nothing to do. God was marking that part of the male body, letting the whole chosen people of Israel know that he was going to bring redemption without that human instrumentality. &gt;&gt; And that's why Mary had to have a b a a virgin birth. A birth. She was a virgin. She had a conception. She had the child in her. She was still a virgin. And Jesus was born uh of a virgin birth. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. So in a sense both of these trees had seed and he said he could not be called both the wicked one and the and the uh son of god at the same time. Cain turned out I've read this two or three times to catch the impact of it myself. Cain turned out in character like his father. &gt;&gt; A bringer of death. That's the first thing he did was bring death. a murderer. &gt;&gt; He his utter defiance of God when faced by the Almighty in Genesis 4 59 13 and 14 show him to be absolutely unhumanlike in characteristics seeming even to surpass any account we have in the scripture concerning a confrontation of Satan by God. This is one of the greatest confrontations and conversations that took place. Cain spoke more than the devil has spoke in an absolute confrontation with God. And he he lied. He was a murderer. &gt;&gt; And that's the fruit. And you could never attribute that to Adam. &gt;&gt; What why do I say all that? Why do I put this emphasis? Not just to establish a serpent seed doctrine, but to say to you that that was what was in the seed. That's what he was. &gt;&gt; And what he was had to come out. &gt;&gt; He was sown in unbelief. &gt;&gt; He said the in Ephesians church age again he said the tree of knowledge produced clever men &gt;&gt; and men of renown. used to take men of renown and the and those were the ones rose up against Moses. &gt;&gt; He said, "The tree of knowledge has produced clever men and men of renown, but their ways are the ways of death. &gt;&gt; God's people are simple, &gt;&gt; but spiritually minded, &gt;&gt; leaning toward God and nature, calmly tilling the soil, caring for truth rather than for wealth. The seed of the serpent has brought tremendous commerce, wonderful in inventions, but with it all comes death. &gt;&gt; Their gunpowder and atomic bombs kill in war and in peace time. Their mechanical inventions such as the car kill even more in the time of peace than do the inventions of inventions of war to destroy in times of trouble. Death and destruction are the fruits of her labors. &gt;&gt; The nature of Satan was injected and this is very very intriguing to me and I trust it will be uh something that you might not need it today, you might not need it tomorrow, but if you take this and put it in your script bag, I'm sure it will be helpful to you. So the nature we can say well okay how does this how do the effect how did that nature get into the into the seed? How how did how was that nature injected in and uh how does the nature of God uh being restored through Jesus Christ. So the nature of Satan was injected into the human liferee through hybrid. &gt;&gt; Remember now he is not a creator. &gt;&gt; He is a perverter. &gt;&gt; He's not a transformer. He's a conformer. Right. &gt;&gt; So now the nature now in leadership last service brother Brandon preached he said God gave you five senses not to contact him &gt;&gt; your earthly home you see taste feel smell and hear. Then you have a spirit on the inside of that and it has five outlets. Conscience, love and so forth. And you contact the spirit world through that. But with your spirit, your physical contacts the physical. Your spiritual contacts the spiritual. But inside of that, he's talking about spiritual. Not talking spiritual in the sense of of the of the supernatural or of God, but your spirit realm contacts the spirit. That's why brother Brandham would say, I take every spirit under my control &gt;&gt; for the glory of God. That's what I'm saying. What comes from the tree of life has to control &gt;&gt; the rest. &gt;&gt; And because the human spirit, you know well yourself, you can have all kinds of emotions. They're not of God. &gt;&gt; You can have emotions that are of God because if you have a you have a supernatural experience, you'll have some emotion. &gt;&gt; That's perfectly fine. But there's all kinds of emotions. And I would say for the most part emotions emotions don't trust them &gt;&gt; because they're so close to the spirit. &gt;&gt; Only the word of God. For the word of God is quick and powerful, sharper than any two-edged sword, dividing even to the dividing aunder of soul and spirit, not of body and spirit, but soul and spirit. So only the word of God can divide and discern what is of of the human nature and what is of the God nature &gt;&gt; and give a person a a an understanding this is of God because it agrees with the word of God. &gt;&gt; If it doesn't agree with the word of God then it just come from the world. &gt;&gt; It came from the conforming to the world. &gt;&gt; All right. He says, "And but in the inside, in that beneath that spirit realm, inside of that, you've got a soul. And that soul is that gene that come from God." &gt;&gt; So inside of you, you can't see it, you can't handle it, but inside of you, you have a soul. And that soul is the gene of God. It come from God. If it didn't come from God, if you don't have that really, then the gospel is not for you. &gt;&gt; But if you have that gene of God and so how, brother Bisc, how do I know I have that gene of God? Well, it's not satisfied. It's not satisfied with the superficial experience to begin with. It's not satisfied with that. It's not even satisfied with just being blessed. all kinds of people not satisfied with say a healing or a supernatural something. We're not satisfied. We we we desire and hunger and thirst after something that is more a reality &gt;&gt; that is beyond that. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And the seed of God, the gene of God, can do nothing but bring forth what God had in his mind in the first place. And it will bring forth a masterpiece for sure. It will bring forth a spotless pure holy son and daughter of God. And there's nothing that will satisfy a believer other than that. &gt;&gt; So the soul now he said that soul is the gene that come from God. He said also in the token there's a blood because the blood had to be shed. In the animal, there's a blood, there's a life, a blood, there's a blood, a life, and a soul in the life. And he said the soul is the nature of the life. Now this I wanted to come down to this point. So now we're talking about the nature. So when God when God was speaking forth his word and as I said last time I spoke here it wasn't just did he speak Hebrew did he speak some other language no was there some verbaliz verbal sound verbalizing or vocalizing of the I don't know all I know is that went out from him. &gt;&gt; Now, just to give you kind of where I'm going, I want you to think deep about this. Now, the woman that came and touched the hem of his garment. She didn't hear any particular sound. She didn't hear him commanding her or saying to her, "If you just come, if you just press through this crowd, if you just reach out your hand, if you just grab a hold of my garment," she didn't hear any sound. &gt;&gt; Are you with me? &gt;&gt; But there was a language. There was something that she was hearing. There was something forcing her, I must touch his garment. &gt;&gt; And there was a faith in her. There was a faith in her that was responding and somehow she knew and the Bible says that when she touched him, he felt virtue go out from him. &gt;&gt; Something went out from him and she received what went out from him. All I can say to you, I don't know what language God spoke, but when he thought of you, but something went out from God for this generation, for this age, for this time, and it went down into you as a being, and you were birthed into this world. God allowed you to have human parents. You came into this world, but inside of you is a soul that came from God. Didn't come from mom, dad. didn't come from Russia, Britain, or or some other country. It came from God. It came from heaven. And you were given that by predestination. And that seed will bring forth the life of God. &gt;&gt; It has nothing to do with anything human. &gt;&gt; It's God life. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And you will do what it tells you to do. Yes, sir. The preacher doesn't have to say, "You're not satisfied. You're not satisfied. You're craving for something else." It's you that's saying that because something inside is saying, "I crave something more. &gt;&gt; I crave more than just quotes. &gt;&gt; I crave more than just tapes. I crave more. I crave the one who gave it, &gt;&gt; the one who's speaking." Amen. &gt;&gt; So ask yourself, I'm trying to bring it on a very human, very, very down to earth level. Ask yourself what caused that woman to reach through? Who told her to do that? And then you'll understand better. When the prophet is trying to describe how things happen, he said he sees like a little light coming out of that great eternal being. &gt;&gt; That little light coming out. He's trying to describe it so he can see it. He said it's the logos. It's the word. &gt;&gt; It's the son of God. &gt;&gt; Something had to come out from God. &gt;&gt; And then it had to be transmitted. He talks about it being materialized one place. He talks about it uh uh he he talks about it being materialized and and and he speaks of that coming out from God. What came out from God? What what is it? Can you you can't see that soul. You can't feel that soul. But that came out from God. &gt;&gt; Came from God. Friends, &gt;&gt; if you have a soul, I'm talking about what came out into you was the nature of God. &gt;&gt; Because it's the nature, the soul, he said, is the nature of the life. Amen. &gt;&gt; And that is why you can't be content with just the world because the nature is the wrong nature. &gt;&gt; The nature wants fame. You don't want fame. That seed is not the the nature wants great wealth and great position. You don't want that. You don't crave for that. The nature doesn't want anything tainted with the world and uncleanness. And that's why you're offended. That's why you feel uh so uh almost uh violated when you see you walk down the street, you hear the music. I just said to my wife, I say it all the time. I said allum, we just have to tell them, I get nervous. I can't even eat. &gt;&gt; Tell them, please shut that down. &gt;&gt; And I'm very vocal with it. There's nobody here that is enjoying that. We're trying to visit. Everybody here is trying to visit. We can't even hear ourselves think. &gt;&gt; Who inspires that? The tree of knowledge. &gt;&gt; It didn't come from God. It violates a It violates a clean spirit. &gt;&gt; You don't want that. &gt;&gt; And the fashions of the world violates &gt;&gt; the spirit of God that's in us. &gt;&gt; Why? Because we have a different nature. &gt;&gt; It's the seed that's in you. The soul, the seed of God. That's the gene of God. &gt;&gt; Friends, you ought to be so thankful if you possess that. &gt;&gt; Brother Bram talks about he goes into a man's office, sees a bunch of pinups there and whatever more. He said it's that he he said he's feeding that demon. &gt;&gt; He's feeding another nature. &gt;&gt; So the soul is the nature of the life. Amen. &gt;&gt; And he says in the future home, your soul is part of God. An attribute of God &gt;&gt; displayed here on earth in a body. Here you are in a body. &gt;&gt; But the it's an attribute of God that's displayed here in the body. The body is to be redeemed. Now the soul's redeemed &gt;&gt; because it was in sin. &gt;&gt; The soul was in sin or the soul was in unbelief. So by injecting his own thoughts and I don't know just exactly this I can't make the full connection and I hope you don't think that I haven't studied enough. I've pondered this very very deep and prayed about it. I'm not trying to bring something deep to you, but maybe these are things you've thought about is is how does a a word of unbelief come and a person as Eve disbelieved and then Satan went in to save I mean I'm sorry Adam went in to save her and but somehow the very nature of Lucifer got transferred &gt;&gt; through that act. It got transferred. Unbelief, friends, &gt;&gt; is a is a terrible, terrible thing. &gt;&gt; Unbelief is so hated by God, &gt;&gt; he's going to eliminate the very source of it. &gt;&gt; And the serpent was changed in his physical structure and God is going to cast Satan and all of the angels which he deceived and cast them into a lake of fire. It's going to be annihilated &gt;&gt; and unbelief will be gone forever. &gt;&gt; You will never be tempted by unbelief &gt;&gt; again. I speak to every son and daughter of God. You will never be you'll never be uh tempted again by unbelief. &gt;&gt; You'll be never be tempted to disbelieve something from God. &gt;&gt; Even some within the message are are are inclined towards disbelieving what the prophet of God said. I tell you that is the most dangerous thing. Don't you ever be conformed to that. &gt;&gt; Don't you ever be moved to that. &gt;&gt; Say I am a believer &gt;&gt; and I believe every word. &gt;&gt; This is not a smorgus board where I pick and choose. I believe all that he said. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Whether it suits me or whether it fits me or whether it makes me joyful or not. Sometimes it has to make us sad sometime. But it's the truth. And it's the truth. We must believe it. &gt;&gt; So in the Smyrnian church age, he said you tamper with God and you reap exactly what you injected. &gt;&gt; If you tamper with God, the prophet is saying then you reap what you injected, you're injecting something into it. He said, "Man ought to learn that from nature he has tampered with nature. He has injected his own ideas into nature and rearrange the molecules. Isn't this incredible? Before all of this uh hybriding of foods &gt;&gt; and and and all this recent very very very recent technology. In fact, as the governments are struggling and there's great resistance within the government, both Canada and the United States because you know their politics is corrupt and so they bend to the where the votes are the most or the pressures the most and the lobbying goes on fiercely &gt;&gt; and there's people said we want to know what we're eating, &gt;&gt; right? We want labels on the food that tell us whether it's half strawberry and half pig. &gt;&gt; That's not so far. That's not even so humorous, but it is the fact. We want to know what this is. We want to know what's in this grain. We want to know what's in this animal. We want to know what's been injected into it. And there's strong strong power up till now have been successful at saying no, we're not going to put it on the label &gt;&gt; and you're not going to know what you're eating. &gt;&gt; Well, I think that the I'm not into politics, but I believe we have a right to know. &gt;&gt; At least when I get a moose, I know that he's eaten the al tops off of alder trees cuz I can see where he bit off the altars and he eats some of the leaves off the altars. And I'm so amazed that God can turn that wood into meat. [Music] &gt;&gt; Anyway, &gt;&gt; it is true. &gt;&gt; Now, some of you folks have trouble with wild meat. It's not wild meat &gt;&gt; anymore than God's a wild manufacturer. &gt;&gt; It's the tamest meat and the calst meat in the world. Amen. &gt;&gt; At least I thought the hunters would shout amen and stand at their feet. What are you doing, brother Blake? Anyhow, &gt;&gt; so how' they inject this nature? He says, "And they has injected his own ideas into nature." That's the nature and the world and rearrange the molecules etc. And now he's reaping a whirlwind. He said now if you fool with nature you get a monstrosity &gt;&gt; and a backfire that will happen if you change the truth into a lie. &gt;&gt; The answer is you will breed. &gt;&gt; You ready? &gt;&gt; Said the answer is you'll breed an antichrist. &gt;&gt; Amen. Exactly right. &gt;&gt; You will. &gt;&gt; Yeah. You'll breed an antichrist &gt;&gt; if you inject something that's against the word of God. &gt;&gt; Well, it might not just show up tomorrow, but he'll be a he'll be an unbeliever to the word of God. And you know, when a person sets on a direction to disbelieve, what's you know what really happens? They just disbelieve more &gt;&gt; and more &gt;&gt; and more all the time till they've disbelieved the whole word. &gt;&gt; People who have rejected the message, for example, they didn't start off one day and just said, you know what? I'm done with this message. I'm done with it. No, they start off, they start, well, I have a problem with that. See, and then I have a problem with that. Then I have a problem with something else. And then that turns into unbelief. And once they find, and I've had them I've had them write up into my office and said, "I can't believe in the cloud anymore." I said, "Well, I don't preach a cloud. I preach Christ." &gt;&gt; They said, "Well," he said, "I have I have evidence that that picture of the cloud, they destroyed a missile over uh Edwards Air Force Base, I think, in Southern California. They destroyed a missile and the prevailing winds blew that cloud over Arizona." And that's and that was his cloud theory. I said, 'Well, I said, uh, uh, Elijah, Elijah, they they said sent his servant out and said, ask him what he sees. He said, he sees a little cloud. He &gt;&gt; sees a little cloud rising up from the ground. I said, what was it? Was it mist? Was it a day that there was mist on the what? What? What caused that? I said, I don't care. He said, then he wanted to know what's the shape of it. It's the shape of a man's hand. Yeah. &gt;&gt; I said, "This cloud, I don't care what caused it. &gt;&gt; You You have your own theories. I have mine." But what was the shape of it? &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And nobody had to nobody had to indoctrinate me. Brother Brandham took it up in the in the service and he had the picture of it. He said, "How many have seen this?" Well, all kinds of people have seen it at Life magazine. He said, "They got it the right the wrong direction. It needs to be this way. And soon as he turned it, the whole the whole congregation, I was sitting there as well. I gasped. &gt;&gt; Oh, it's Jesus. &gt;&gt; I took the picture home. Just some little playmates of my daughters in the in the townhouse complex and one come running in. I said, "Who's this?" She said, "It's Jesus." I said, "Even a child. &gt;&gt; Even a child knows it. &gt;&gt; We don't care what caused it. God brought it in. Hallelujah. And I would say if it was a rocket, that would be to me more glorious. God took a human instrumentality and he let he let the human mind construct something and put it right into his own his own his own description, his own faith. But it wasn't that because it was seven angels &gt;&gt; and it came from the eternities &gt;&gt; in a split. &gt;&gt; Dust thou believe? &gt;&gt; I do believe. Hallelujah. They came from the eternities in a split with a message that you need to hear. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; They came with the message of the tree of life. &gt;&gt; Friends, I'm getting ahead of myself, but we got the tree of life. You got the tree of life back again. Brother Brandham said, "It's not back on Adam and Eve anymore. It's on your shoulders. &gt;&gt; They had a tree of life. You have the tree of life. [Applause] He said, "As the seed of the woman was literally God reproducing himself in human flesh, the seed of the woman." He even spoke it to the serpent. He said, "Her seed already prophesying of himself, her seed." Because he would become that seed. Amen. &gt;&gt; Her seed will bruise your head. &gt;&gt; He was announcing, "Serpent, I'm going to crush your head." And you look at the word is crush. Bruised is crushed. I will crush your head. &gt;&gt; I will crush the mind that this ever came from. I will crush this mind of unbelief. &gt;&gt; Glory to God. &gt;&gt; I'll do away with it. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Aren't you glad he did away with it in your case? Amen. &gt;&gt; He made you a believer. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; And he said, "So the seed, so the seed of the serpent is the literal way that Satan found his found he was able to open the door to himself into the human race." And that's as close as I can get it. That's how he found his way. A literal way. literal way that Satan found he was able to open the door to himself into the human race. And thus the world that you rub shoulders with every day is possessed with a nature, &gt;&gt; this beast nature. &gt;&gt; We live in a very unclean world, friends. And that world may be Satan being as cunning as he is, he doesn't show you his brazen or his uh unvarnished self, &gt;&gt; but he polishes it all up so it will look attractive to you, so it'll look enticing to you. But once he gets a hold of a life where it goes to, &gt;&gt; it's a it it is uh &gt;&gt; it's a real shame. Young people, I speak to you in the name of the Lord. Don't ever let yourself to start to becoming conformed. I got to conform. I got to talk like my peers. I have to talk like my schoolmates. I have to dress like them. They do crazy things. I kind of have to do crazy things. Maybe not as crazy as them, but I'm I'm I'm conforming. I'm attracted to it. I'm changing. My language is changing. How I do things, how I think is changing. Don't ever get caught in that trap. &gt;&gt; That goes good for anybody. &gt;&gt; He found his way into the human race. He said it was impossible for Satan, for he is only a created spirit being. It was impossible for Satan to reproduce himself in the manner which God reproduced himself. He couldn't reproduce himself. So the Genesis account tells how he produced his seed and injected or injected introduced or injected himself into the human race. &gt;&gt; Now this has always been a mystery to me, but this clears it up. Also recall that Satan is called the serpent. It is his seed or injection into the human race that we are speaking of. &gt;&gt; Are you following me? &gt;&gt; And then brother Brandham goes on in the Ephesian church age and he says, "Let me try to crystallize your thinking." He wants to crystallize our thinking &gt;&gt; on this subject so you can see the necessity of our going into the serpent seed doctrine as I have. He said we start with the fact that there were two trees. Now he's going back. We start with the fact that there were two trees in the midst of the garden. The tree of life was Jesus. &gt;&gt; Amen. And the other tree was definitely is definitely Satan because of what came forth of the fruit of that tree. And I want to now move towards that. &gt;&gt; Say some things in a few moments that might be a little bit startling. Now then he said we know that both of these trees had a relationship to man. And if both trees are still here, they have a relationship to man &gt;&gt; or they would never have been placed there. They must they must have had a part in the sovereign plan and purpose of God in their relationship to mankind and to himself or we would never impute omniscience unto God. He said, "Now the word most definitely sets forth that from before the foundation of the earth, the purpose of God was to share his eternal life with man." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Now, both trees are here. &gt;&gt; And their branches are still intertwined. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Very much so. &gt;&gt; And they spread out their branches over the entire earth, this globe. They've the branch is spread out over Bellingham and Seattle, London, Vancouver, Surrey, over the entire earth over the country or state you move from. The branches are there and the people are picking the fruit. They're enjoying maybe the fruit of science. the fruit of politics, the fruit of education, and it has a fruit. I'm standing here today as a witness to tell you I have seen people sucked away into a pit of despair by eating the fruit of education. &gt;&gt; I've seen other people eat from the fruit of education and use it because they kept it controlled by the life from the tree of life. And that's the only success. &gt;&gt; Otherwise, it will swallow you up. &gt;&gt; You might as well say, "Amen. I know that it's true." &gt;&gt; I know that is true. &gt;&gt; I'm speaking about people that sat in the congregation, a congregation of the believers. And that and and that spirit that was in that segment or that part of this world, this world be not conformed to this world. And they began just little by little becoming conformed and conformed. And they became enamored. They were told how smart they are. Oh, &gt;&gt; you have to forgive me and yet don't forgive me cuz I just talk in private. My wife was saying and referring to something and saying, "Oh, they are so smart and so intelligent." I said, "No, they're stupid. They're not smart at all. They're actually stupid. They can't figure out even how to conduct their own lives. How can I be so smart and yet be empty and be dissatisfied in all of this? &gt;&gt; Hey, listen. I'm talking from experience. &gt;&gt; I'm a school dropout. &gt;&gt; All right. &gt;&gt; I'm not lifting that up. I don't want anybody to be school dropout. We got We got kids out of If they drop out of this school here, we're going to do damage to you. But we were we were having conducting a big sale one time and and one of the men was and you know one of the people members of the company he says see that fellow down there I said yeah you know what he was doing he was sweeping the floor he's sweeping the sales floor he said he he is so advanced in UBC he's got all kinds of education and and he's he doesn't know exactly what he wants to be. He's permanent school. He's a permanent student. He just you ever don't be so silent now. I'm telling you my experience. And there he was. He was intelligent. Oh, did he ever have it up here? But when it translated, it went down to his hands. It became a broom hands on a broom because he hadn't figured out where he was going to be. &gt;&gt; Anybody who's really smart ought to know at least where they're going &gt;&gt; and what they're going to do and what they want to be &gt;&gt; anyhow. &gt;&gt; I said that cuz I needed to say it. &gt;&gt; I'm I'm totally exasperated. Look at Look at the laws. some of the laws that control your life, &gt;&gt; control how you bank, control the financing. How can such brilliant people not foresee the meltdown we've just had? How can a brilliant mind not realize that a man who gets a hundred million dollars as a bonus cuz he's so smart? He runs a financial institution and robs the people. Who needs $100 million for a bonus? &gt;&gt; You people buy gas? &gt;&gt; You gas your cars up. Do you think they need to charge what they're charging? &gt;&gt; They don't need to charge it. It's smart people that are stealing it. &gt;&gt; I mean, people might say, "Well, that's not even the gospel." Absolutely, it's the gospel. But the prophet of God said, "These things are of the devil. They came from the But you have to pay it. That's right. And you drive a car. That's good. It came from the tree of knowledge. But we use it for the kingdom of God. You drive to church with it. A lot of other people don't. You You control it. &gt;&gt; What you're going to do with it. &gt;&gt; You have to control this life. &gt;&gt; Everything from the tree of life controls what come from the tree of knowledge. I'm going to preach it till I feel I'm done. [Applause] &gt;&gt; Says the other tree is Satan because of what came forth of the fruit of that tree. Now both of these trees had a relationship with man and they had a a place a part in the sovereign plan of God. Now he says man could not directly come and partake of that tree of life in the midst of the garden. That eternal life of the tree had to become flesh first. &gt;&gt; That's why God drove man out lest he take of the fruit of the tree. So he had to drive man out. But before God could raise and save a sinner, he had to have a sinner to raise &gt;&gt; and save. Amen. &gt;&gt; Oh friends, if you want something deep that's deep. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Before he could save a sinner, he had to have a sinner &gt;&gt; to save. &gt;&gt; What kind of God is We're not questioning what kind of God. That's God. &gt;&gt; He can do what he wishes to do. He had to have a sinner to save. He wanted to show his great his great power to forgive and to redeem and take the the the the worst of them. Paul said he was the chief of sinners. I don't know. But he said man had to fall. The fall which would be caused by Satan had to have flesh to make to make fall. Satan had to come through flesh also. But Satan could not come through human flesh to make the fall as would Christ come in human flesh to restore the fallen. &gt;&gt; This doesn't really sound like someone from a seventh grade education in Kentucky, does it? I &gt;&gt; tell you what, friends, this came from higher than anything here on this planet. &gt;&gt; It came from the the throne of God. &gt;&gt; Do you agree? He says, "But there was an animal, a serpent so close to man that Satan could get to that beast and through that beast he could get to human flesh and cause the fall and inject himself." This is why I'm belaboring this point to because it it's it's almost mysterious. and inject himself thereby into the human race even as Jesus would come uh as Jesus would one day come and inject himself into the human race into human bodies even to the extent of a resurrection wherein we would have bodies like unto his glorious body. So when he injected his seed the soul into the believer there's a resurrection in you. Amen. &gt;&gt; There's a resurrection in you. You have it right now. If you get if you run out on the street and get killed today, don't worry. There's a resurrection in you. &gt;&gt; And you that are believers, are you believers in this message? There's a rapture in you. It's already in you. &gt;&gt; That seed that God spoke, it has the power of rapture. Has the power of resurrection. It's greater than the atoms that make up your body. It's the word of God. &gt;&gt; He said, "Let there be." I don't know what the sound was. I don't know exactly what the verbiage was. And it's irrelevant to me. It's immaterial to us because we know that God has spoken it. He put it in his word in written form so we wouldn't have to mistake what he meant. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And so now having said that, I'll just recquote this please. But there was an animal, the serpent, because I learned even in school that we are of the mammal. Biology students, is that right? Wouldn't make any difference whether it says right or not. He said it &gt;&gt; so close to man that Satan could get to that beast and through that beast he could get to the human flesh. That's what he wanted to when he said I will ascend &gt;&gt; to the sides of the north &gt;&gt; to the congregation to the sides of the north. And if you read it and take it down and break it down into the words that is in the Hebrew language, it is the sides of the north as a place of procreation. &gt;&gt; I will ascend. I will go to that place. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; That's what was in his mind. And that's where he had to go because he wanted to inject himself into the human race because he wanted to be where God, listen, he wanted to be where God wants to be. God wants to rule and reign in your life. &gt;&gt; And that is why Satan desired it in the first place. I want to be I want to be lifted up. I want to be worshiped. And he becomes the beast in the book of Revelation. And all whose names are not found in the book of life, they worship the beast. &gt;&gt; Listen to me, my brother, my sister. the seed that God put in you, you want to thank God for it because it's on the basis of that seed that you will not be found worshiping him. &gt;&gt; There's something in you that resists that. &gt;&gt; And it's the seed in you. It's not your mind. You're not figuring out what's good, what's right, what's what's according to the word. We're not. It's your soul &gt;&gt; and it witnesses to you. That's not right. &gt;&gt; Listen to that soul. &gt;&gt; Listen to that voice. Amen. &gt;&gt; So the tree of knowledge of good and evil has spread its b branches over all the earth. Eve wanted wisdom and believed that by partaking of this tree, she would become wise as gods. And here's where I want to come to yet. I still have just a little ways to go. And when the woman saw that the tree was good for food and that it was pleasant to the eyes and a tree to be desired to make one wise, she took the fruit. So when she came to that place and she had reasoned it out, this is pleasant. This is good for food. And when she saw when she looked upon it and this is where I want to come to and I might not get there completely so I'll just say the phrase we as children of God do not want to be and must not look to the tree of knowledge for the answers to our spirit. spiritual dilemma, our spiritual question or what we think we need to know. We cannot be looking to the tree of knowledge for our answers in life. &gt;&gt; I want you to memorize that. I must not look to the tree of knowledge for the answers to my life. &gt;&gt; The tree of knowledge has lots of answers. It'll it is there. The enticement was this will make you wise. This will even make you spiritual. You'll be like gods and you know the difference between good and evil. &gt;&gt; And all of that was very attractive to her. The fruits from the and they and and don't forget the branches are intertwined. So when you look up, you'll have to have something else &gt;&gt; that will tell you that's the tree of knowledge of good and evil. &gt;&gt; But this branch over here is the tree of life. &gt;&gt; You'll have to have a special &gt;&gt; inner &gt;&gt; Holy Ghost &gt;&gt; wisdom. Amen. I can say a lot of things right now. I'm just holding back a little bit. And when she saw, now he says, the prophet says the devil always works in beauty. &gt;&gt; So the things that come from the tree of knowledge look nice. &gt;&gt; They are attractive. I'm not speaking down just physical the physical beauty or the physical individual but he he works in beauty and you that God has you that are in the beauty of your youth don't become caught away with that you know you're strong you're healthy you're young you got a good physique and the girls you know you got that brightness and that that uh shining eyes and and all the things. And then and then there are things and you go through the department store and look at something that can maybe add to that beauty and kind of there's a desire say you know that might be nice if I you know you move along through hey why do you think you go in these department stores right here the fir the first thing is all the all the beauty items You think some Holy Ghost preacher designed that? No. They didn't call a Holy Ghost preacher in there and say, "What should we put right at the entrance to the shopping center?" No, they put all the things there that want to, you know, that will appeal to you. &gt;&gt; And you know what? They don't put the men's work boots out there. Even though the man has to go out and wake up, make a living, but they don't put the man's work boots out there. They're not Hey, fellas, they're not interested in us. &gt;&gt; Amen. Oh, you might find some clone that smells nice &gt;&gt; somewhere buried amongst all that perfume. How can you say that, brother? Cuz I've been there &gt;&gt; and have to go like almost hat in hand. Have you got any after shave? Oh, you mean bomb? No, not bomb. After shave. Oh, I don't know if we got any. dig around all this perfume and all these things and you got strips that you can smell it. Who who who you putting it on for? &gt;&gt; I say to my wife, "Make sure you're putting that on for me." So you you've smelled a few and they said, "Well, here, just take a new one." What are we doing, friends? It's right on the door. I'm telling you, you know what? You know what? We become so conformed to it, we don't even think twice. I just go barging right through and here they're flowering all the girls up and with the thing on their face and you know all the brushes and everything else and this color and that color and this and and they're all in nice smoks like they know something and they're buticians and some other kind of you know what they're out for? They're out for this. All right. &gt;&gt; Forgive me. You didn't expect this kind of a service. Neither did I. But anyway, that that's the world. &gt;&gt; That's the world. And they're they're out there to get you to conform to it. &gt;&gt; Say, "Well, well, I'll you know, and once they hook you on one, then you go to another one anyway." &gt;&gt; All right. So he says in the Thotyron church age and he says I'll I'll I will put no other burden on you. The word for burden is weight or pressure. The pressures the pressure of the dark ages was either bend or be broken. Bow or die. It was the Inquisition. And that was, you know, maybe army or soldiers or whatever more could come in here from the government and say, "You're going to believe this. If you want to believe this, you can recamp till you go out the doors. Once you go out the doors, we're going to we're going to behead you or we're going to kill you or we're going to put you to the stake." Well, I'm not going to lay any heavy on you, but that was the Inquisition. &gt;&gt; And so, some wouldn't bend, they wouldn't bow, they wouldn't burn. and many others did bend and uh uh it was the power of the empire backing up satanic worship to be organized or pay with your life. Each age had its pressure. For example, the great burden of this age is the pressure of riches of soft living and nervous tensions. You might not have pressure of riches on you. You might not even have the pressure of soft living. However, I think most of us do. You know, we're out we're not out there to make life more grueling, to make it more difficult. We want to make it easier. Listen, friends, my father was a carpenter. I'm, you know, I'm I'm speaking now from what I know. You have to forgive me. I kind of got tainted with brother Kyle on Wednesday night. He just talked from his personal experience. Uh, I I I I knew a little bit about carpenter work. I go over here to help brother Kim and his men and they got stuff I've never seen in my life. Said, "We have to, you know, we have to go in and we have to cut around that." Oh, no, don't use that. He said, "We we got a we got a saw that'll do that, man." And and the the they they do things with stuff I've never seen. Said, "Can that all happen?" Well, yeah. We just pulled that saw right off the tree of knowledge. &gt;&gt; Well, I'm glad that it's building a school &gt;&gt; for you kids. &gt;&gt; But it's a pressure of easy living. You know, we just want it easier and easier and easier and that's that's fine. I don't want to go back to the scrub board. I don't want to see my wife doing this. I don't want to see the old sewing washing machine or sewing machine. Yes, we do. But not washing machine. And we we don't we don't want to go backwards, &gt;&gt; but we better control our forward movement. &gt;&gt; And nervous tensions. Well, there's no use saying anything about that because none of us have that, &gt;&gt; do we? Some of you that have the simplest life. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; It should be so simple. It should be so easy. &gt;&gt; And you got all kinds. How about you young couples that just got married or you that are going to get married or you that have been married for a little while? How about you that got children? You have no tensions. You're smiling, James. You're honest. How about the rest of you folks? No nervous tensions. Well, I and my wife, we have no we have no tension because we're just coasting along now. You want to come to my house on a Sunday morning? Trying to get the printer going and trying to do this and trying to do that. Why? So I can get here and speak. And I don't want to be, you know, I don't want to be searching and looking for things. I want to be able to have had spent I don't know what this means to you, but I've spent two weeks just in this message because the one thought I have and I'm going to be concluding soon is I I just came to the conclusion we are so inclined and so pressured to look soon as something happens our life we must not look to the tree of knowledge &gt;&gt; for the immediate answer. &gt;&gt; I believe we should look to the tree of life. Amen. &gt;&gt; Okay, I'm going to carry on just a little bit more, please, for a few minutes. He said, "Oh, if we are the sons and daughters of the king, the king of kings, let's conduct our character as Christians. We are aliens. We're pilgrims and we're strangers here. This is not our world. We're seeking a kingdom to come that is to come. This is not our home. Though we be tossed about and made fun of by the world and called this and that and the other and old fashioned and all like that, what do we care? You don't want to be partnering yourself with some kind of a movie star or some television star or something. You're a daughter of God. You notice what he said? He said uh you know even a pastor's wife or or someone else within the church or you you see he talks about a movie star that is why God so hates that whole system called Hollywood because it is polluted and he said we are transporting all the iniquity and the evil and the filth to Paris where it used to come from. Listen friends, it comes right from our own country. They call Vancouver Hollywood North. I don't think that's anything to boast about. I think that's a disgrace. That's why we got so much perversion around. Get all this kind of talented uh artists and people and so on. And you get all this perversion that's around. It's a great pressure. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It's a great pressure. You're a daughter of God. You're a son of God. Let's act like God. We are the children of God. We know that we're sons and daughters of the king. Let our own Let our own character, let our character reflect his presence, no matter how rough it gets. &gt;&gt; I tell you, this is looking for rugged men and women. &gt;&gt; Amen. Let's let our character reflect his presence. Now, in the in the Old Testament, I'm just going to drop this in quickly. In the Old Testament, and you've probably read it, they had what was called the frontlets between the eyes, and that was the little square boxes. How many have seen that? Yeah, many of you. Okay. They have the little square boxes and they also put one on the arm. It is because in there the real strict orthodox there's a certain variety of them sect of them that have the actually the word of the law written uh written in that on a little wee tiny scroll and it's placed in there because they're giving testimony that they're keeping the word before them all the time. And that was the purpose of it to keep keep the word before. And that's why it means only the frontlets. And the word for frontlets means only that one should always be preoccupied with the words. This is from the from the some of the uh Hebrews, the Jews. It means only that one should be preoccupied with the words of the Torah as if they were in front of one's eyes all the time. You see, and that's why Apostle Paul said, "While we look not at the things which are seen, &gt;&gt; the things which are seen are passing, but at the things which are not seen, for the things which are seen are temporal." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But the things which are not seen are eternal. &gt;&gt; The things which are seen, friends, now we may take u we we'll we'll strip the land. We'll strip the soil. We'll cut down the trees, put it through a mill and all the rest of it, and we reshape it from from a big tree to a piece of lumber and we build a house out of it. We have to do that. We have pieces of iron come out of the and different metals and plastics and so on come out and we have a car we drive. We're we're glad that we have that and we need that. But remember remember this messenger said that that civilization will have none of these things &gt;&gt; and that soul within you and me cries out for that civilization. I don't know what it's going to be like, but my soul yearns for it because this one I see nothing but death and trouble and and and sin and uncleanness. And our soul cries and and people will wait, they wait for death to be released from it. &gt;&gt; But there's a group of people, we shouldn't just look to death to be released from it. We look to life to be released from it. The life that's in me says we are here to be changed. Say, "Oh God, bring that rapture change. Oh God, what should we always look? That should be the prize of the high calling in Christ Jesus." We constantly never get tired of looking for that. &gt;&gt; Keep that in front of you all the time. Amen. &gt;&gt; Brother Bannon was talking and speaking about Luke and he was speaking about Job and he said the first he's called a redeemer talking about Job's phrase and next he's God. I know my redeemer liveth. Notice now, please notice. I know my redeemer liveth. And the last days he'll stand on the earth. &gt;&gt; And though the skin worms destroys this body, yet in my flesh shall he see God. Brother Brham is saying to us that the revelation is is a deepening revelation. It's an increasing revelation. First he knows it's his redeemer. I know my redeemer liveth. And he shall stand on the earth and with my own eyes I shall see God. &gt;&gt; Now whom I shall see for myself and my eyes shall behold and not another. He said when he was dying and his body rotting and while he was in the flesh he looked he looked till he seen the resurrection. &gt;&gt; So he kept looking. Look at I I'm appealing now to you that are sitting here ones I'm speaking to. If the resurrection or if the rapture or the change of this body or the or or or the promise of God is not a reality to you, then you need to take this principle. You know, you know what I'm doing today? I'm looking hard at the tree of life with you and encouraging you to look at that tree of life and I'm catching these principles. He said that Job looked and while he looked he saw he was his redeemer and as he kept looking he saw that he was his God and as he kept looking he saw the resurrection. I would say we as a people we need to keep looking. You keep looking at that word. You keep looking at that we call it a message. You keep looking at the promise of God that God you just keep looking at it. Not just looking at a book but looking at &gt;&gt; I have I have I have the power of transformation here and I just take line by line don't change your nature line by line underline it blessed me see if the attributes of God speaking forth and it's placed on paper the attributes of God speaking forth and he placed it on paper because he knew that generations would have to read it. So we keep looking. Don't look. Don't look friends for your satisfaction from the tree of knowledge. It's abundant. &gt;&gt; It's just hanging with all kinds of things. Don't look for the answers to this life on the tree of oh if I only get that then I'll you know I'll kind of be out of the uh I'll be out of the this this great burden that I have. No. No. Satan in this world has another one fixed for you. &gt;&gt; We ought to govern our lives entirely by the word of God. &gt;&gt; We want our excess our success when we get done. We want our success to be well done. Yeah. &gt;&gt; Thou good and faithful servant. &gt;&gt; That's what you want to hear. I'm telling you, that's what you want to. If you don't hear that, we've missed everything. &gt;&gt; Well done, thou good and faithful servant. We don't have to be somebody spectacular in the kingdom of God. We don't have to be, you know, some vocal person. Don't have to be a preacher. Don't have to be a singer. Just have to be faithful in the calling that God has for you. And the best thing that you can do is say, "Lord, I'm here for your purpose. I'm here to live for you. I'm here to do the most menial thing if I need to, but I'm here to be faithful to the call of God." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Now, I I need to just put a couple. He said, because I want to let you know that there were some who saw, but it didn't do any good. &gt;&gt; There's some who see this message and they say, "Oh man, anybody can see that." I gave the serpent seed to about three young men and they were so they they they almost were were levitating off of my front room floor. He said and and one slid off the sofa and slid right onto the floor. He was so transfixed. And I said, "Well, now uh you know, keep this to yourself." Oh, he said, "My pastor will see this." I said, "No, don't take it there. You just take it for yourself." Oh, they were so filled they left there and never saw him again. Do they see something? Absolutely. &gt;&gt; So, Brother Brandham says that what I'm trying to say is this, that they see clearly the clearly a vindicated word like Pilate and the rest of them did. &gt;&gt; They saw clearly the vindicated word like Pilate and the rest of them did and like the Roman soldier. But you are going to wait too late &gt;&gt; to get anything about it. He said he should have used the spear the other way. The doors will be closed like it was in the days of Noah and then it was too late. You might wake up some morning and say, "I intend to get out of this mess." Don't wait too long. You better look and live now. &gt;&gt; That's what he was saying. Yeah. Amen. &gt;&gt; The centurion, the Bible says, "And when the centurion and they that were with him watching Jesus saw the earthquake and those things that were done, they feared greatly, saying, They feared greatly." When they saw the earthquake and all the other signs, they said, "Surely this was the son of God." &gt;&gt; Too late. That's right. Amen. &gt;&gt; We as a congregation of people, one thing for sure, we're not to have any excuse for being too late. &gt;&gt; You say, "Well, what what would I do, brother Bisc? What should I do?" I would press with everything that I have. Listen, I have read and studied this message for many, many years, probably for close to 40 years. You know what? One of my greatest desires is to immerse myself &gt;&gt; further into this word because I know it's not just so I get a nugget for this time or find a secret for this time. I I know that in there is the secret of the resurrection. in there. Rapturing faith is on the tape. It's in that voice. It's actually there. If we knew that your rapture, the thing that your soul is crying out for, it's literally there. &gt;&gt; Shouldn't we find everything? It might be that he'd say, "It's not even the time. It's maybe not just the time." But I would say to you and I, I'm saying it to myself. I want to give myself. That is one of the great thirsts I have in in my soul is just to give myself, immerse myself, read it line by line, paragraph by paragraph, and and make a note where it speaks to me. I urge you to do that. I can tell you your life will never be the same. And you'll never never regret it. You'll never regret it. If people say, "Well, I put too much emphasis on the message." Let me say to you, I am prepared to go to the judgment bar of Almighty God and have him tell me, "You put too much emphasis on my prophet's voice." &gt;&gt; I don't think that's ever going to happen. &gt;&gt; I think that those that have loved it and embraced it, he's going to say, "Blessed are you. You love my voice. &gt;&gt; You love what I said. &gt;&gt; You believed it. &gt;&gt; Enter on in." You know why he's going to say enter in? Because he's going to say you're going to hear more of it. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. [Applause] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; I called this message today and I'm giving the title at the end, Beholding the Tree of Life. &gt;&gt; Just beholding it. &gt;&gt; Just looking and beholding him. something that can you know when two people love one another &gt;&gt; they don't have to say a whole lot of things they don't have to do a whole lot of things sometime they just look at each other &gt;&gt; say you just appreciate that person appreciate them for what they are you appreciate them for their character for their nature for their loyalty their integrity you appreciate them you don't have to have a whole lot of exper confession and I urge you just take the take the message. It's not it's not just some words. You've had a you've had a relationship with this book, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; You know why you have a relationship? Because it's a person. &gt;&gt; And this person is a man and you're the bride. Amen. &gt;&gt; And this person has seed &gt;&gt; and that seed comes into your soul &gt;&gt; and that seed is ordained of almighty God to bring forth certain things and it will do so. Oh, I thank him for it. I want to maybe if we have the musicians please. Amen. Let's just bow our heads moment. Father in the quietness of this moment as we had prayer this morning and been praying till just coming to the pullpit praying oh God that your Holy Spirit would move in near to each individual. Take the words that have been spoken. I pray father they will be inspired by the Holy Ghost to look upon you to see you as a person to see the person of Jesus Christ to see the almighty one to see the creator for he has spoken all things into existence. Oh God that we might see you in all of your beauty in all of your glory that we might be inspired by looking. Father, I pray that your blessing, more than your blessing, but I pray that your voice, oh God, will be heard in the inner regions of our soul in Jesus Christ's name that you might be glorified. We ask it. Amen.

What grace is this, Lord, that you should look upon us? You looked upon us so that we could look upon you. We didn't know you, oh God. We were so weward. We were so confused. But you looked upon us and you looked upon us as you spoke through the prophet. You saw us in the wilderness. You saw us in the desert. You saw us wallowing in our own blood. You came and you had mercy and you picked us up and you bathed us and you washed us, oh God. And you said, "You are clean now. You are clean through the word that I spoke." Oh God, as we hear this word, give this people a revelation that what has been spoken through your prophet, through your messenger, through your servant is one that is a washing water of the word, oh God, to cleanse us. And how we need this cleansing daily, daily. We need this cleansing. Cleanse our minds. Cleanse our thoughts, oh God. Cleanse our nature, Father. Refine it, I pray.

Oh, Father, reach out to those, oh God, who are yet resisting you and yet resisting you w- without any purpose, Lord. And they know that it is it's impossible for them to continue the direction they're going because they must yield. They know that they're children of God. They must yield. And there may be some even here today, Lord, who have not been fully touched or fully yielded to you. I pray, oh God, you'll break every obstacle that hinders them. Break every hindrance that hinders them, Lord. And may they cry out and call out and say, "You are my Lord. You're my God. You're my redeemer. You're my all and all.
