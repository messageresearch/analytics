TRANSCRIPT
========================================
oh thank God thank God I am free I'm free free free from this world [Music] of i' beened in the blood of Jesus [Music] been [Music] Hallelujah I'm glad down [Music] me like a bird out [Music] of a [Music] that like [Music] Fortune andad I found out he could bring me out his holy God I [Music] am jusn again Hallelujah [Music] I'm by wonderful [Music] gra Hallelujah glad to be in the house of God Amen come with expectation then God will certainly see that you're not disappointed if you put in for a small order that's what you get but we ask largely then that's what we'll get amen God bless you you may be seated just going to make a couple of uh announcements first the deacons have asked me to uh make more clear regarding the uh announcement which we made a uh regarding prayer requests rather than bringing them here and having us read them uh but they wanted to know and I guess there was some questions to them are are the people that are not well here able to be prayed for oh my goodness absolutely that's what we're here for and you're coming and be prayed for all it was was concerning longw written out requests and we're reading them and reading them service after service service so we said that bring a cloth bring an anointed cloth bring a bring something that you would like to have prayed over and we'll pray for it here and uh I I think maybe just writing out a request comes a lot easier and uh I I noticed since we made that request we haven't had a single handkerchief and that's what the Bible says so if you if you're really burdened and you really want to have somebody prayed for that's not here you'd like to send something to them and have them have have a a cloth or anointed cloth prayed for then that's what we'll do here because I noticed brother brandom says on the tapes we've got all these anointed we got these cloths and these handkerchiefs and aprons and whatever more and they took from the bodies of the Apostles and and gave those cloths and people were healed and so I just want to go back to the pattern I think that's fine I really think that's fine when we're a lot smaller and it is actually this isn't this isn't anything sudden at all it's been really on my mind for a long time and I'm rather slow to move and do things sometimes but Moses was slow brother Bram said he was slow so I'm in good company we we'll all be slow we been don't want to be too slow preaching however we take too much time uh so I hope that that is clear we we're just happy to pray with anybody that's here physically that's not well you feel free as always to come and be prayed for and this is the House of Deliverance not only a house of worship a House of Deliverance and I quite frankly am a very firm believer that he confirmed his word with signs following and if the word is being preached you should expect an answer from God don't come here not expecting to receive from God you should come expecting to receive whatever your need is amen going to be turning to the word in a few minutes but there's a verse of a a song a very common song at Calvary which we all know and uh the last verse we're just going to say the chor and the last verse and then the chorus the last verse says oh the love that Drew salvation's plan all the grace that brought it down to man oh the mighty Gulf that God did span at Calvary and we're coming up to Easter now we got a flyer in the mail and perhaps you did too it was from Jehovah's Witness es and they were making a an announcement the greatest man the death of the greatest man that ever lived and I had glanced it over but they didn't say anything about his resurrection might have something to do with what they believe I don't know I have some pretty good idea but we're not celebrating a death only we're celebrating a resurrection we're not just not just the death but it's the life that we're celebr crating and it was a life it was a body that couldn't corrupt it was a life that couldn't stay in the Tomb and it's a life that's been passed on Hallelujah all the love that Drew salvation's plan and all the grace that brought it down to man this is very very much in line with what I want to speak about today and so I've got to try to capture capture your thoughts early would ask you to be very focused and for me help me all right you do that it'll really help me God bless your brother Tony hav't even shaking brother Tony's hands at Rebecca since they've been back amen nice to have everybody [Music] here oh the love that Drew salvation [Music] the that it down [Music] to Mighty [Music] God Mery there was great and Grace was free there was multiped to me [Music] [Applause] [Music] my stand as we sing the last verse once again oh that down [Applause] oh the mighty all that God [Applause] and mercy there was great [Music] and my [Music] and let's thank Him shall we how gracious how wonderful you are Lord we're thinking of this time of the year especially Lord the time of you entering in and the people were praising and worshiping and throwing their garments down waving palms and a short time later crying crucify crucify but there was no great voice or shouting except the Angels rejoicing when you raised and came out of the Tomb and began to make yourself known and today we're here to give you thanks Lord Jesus how thankful we are that you have made yourself known almighty God by the Holy Spirit you have sent the spirit of Revelation you've sent the anointing upon us that we have been given eyes to see and we thank you for what we see we thank you Lord for the things that you'll still show us and we pray that you will magnify yourself amongst us oh God I pray that you will demonstrate your power bind every evil spirit every hindering Spirit Lord I pray you'll loose oh God our our minds that seem so so encumbered sometime I pray that you'll remove all the weights oh God and the things that so easily beset us father in the name of Jesus give Liberty to your word I pray give unction to it let the Holy Spirit be the speaker I pray and may each person receive what they have need of bless all that are with us father streaming at this moment may it not just be a stream of are my voice but may there be a stream of the Holy Spirit the very presence of the Divine one coming into their rooms and into their places of worship in Jesus Christ's name we ask it amen amen I'll invite you to take your Bibles and turn to John's gospel the first chapter and we're going to be reading such a familiar scripture starting with verse one down to verse 5 and then we'll read verse 14 keep your Bibles open because we're turning to other uh brief scriptures after this in the beginning was the word and the Word was with God and the Word was God the same was in the beginning with God all things were made by him and without him was not anything made that was made in him was life and the life was the light of man and the light shineth in darkness and the Darkness comprehended it not down to verse 14 and the Word was made flesh and dwelt among us and we beheld his glory GL the glory as of the only begotten of the father full of grace and truth down to verse 18 no man hath seen God at any time the only begotten son which is in the bosom of the father he hath declared him turn to chapter 8 if you would please in verse 42 Jesus said unto them if God were your father you would love me for I proceeded forth and came from God oh the grace that brought it down to man for I proceeded forth and came from God neither came I of myself but he sent me turn to chapter 20 in verse 21 he just showed them his hands in his sight after the resurrection then said Jesus to them again peace be unto you as my father hath sent me even so send I you and when he had said this he breathed on them and said unto them receive ye the Holy Ghost as my father ha sent me he said I proceeded forth from God and now he's saying after his resurrection as my father hath sent me even so send I you and when he had said this he breathed on them and said receive ye the Holy Ghost you may be seated the scripture tells us also Peter preaching and soon after this experience and they'd receiv received the Holy Spirit he's telling the people how that God anointed Jesus of Nazareth with the Holy Ghost and with power who went about doing good and healing all that were open oppressed of the devil for God was with him whenever we read John 1 it always confronts a minister with a tremendous challenge because we're starting in the beginning in the beginning was the word and from the beginning you can go anywhere it's so vast it's so such an expanse of of place to go and it's always a little bit of a challenge to Where Do We Go From Here in the beginning but I want to I want to focus our thoughts because I've been speaking the last two Sundays on anointed for Rapture so I want to tie together I want to continue with this subject of anointing and in the first message I brought the uh process of anointing and how it was an Eastern it was in the Eastern culture and I I took it on the physical side and how the first time anointing really comes in God actually referred to Jacob anointing or it doesn't even say he anointed but he poured oil upon the pillar that he had slept on it with ston stones that he had made for a pillow and it was at that time he had that dream and he saw the Angels ascending and descending and the ladder was on Earth but it stretched into heaven and he had that dream and he was so impacted by that dream so affected by that dream and the presence that it left him with he said this this is bethl this is the Gate of Heaven and he called it bethl which is the house of God and he was so affected by that that was the first instance he made an altar or raised up those stones that he' slept on and used as a pillow and he poured oil upon them and then God later reminded him and God used the word the pillar that thou D anoint and the and the vow that you made and he made the vow if you'll be with me and so that was the first instance of the anointing and just take you quickly through it and then God told Moses then later now it's it's the a Abraham's children so he told Moses make oil and make it a fragrant oil make it for anointing oil and you'll make it fragrant and then later he told them anoint the priests the sons of Aaron and then later he anoint Aaron the high priest and anoint the Altar and anoint the th things that are in the Tabernacle and it just began to ex expand in its understanding and meaning and the people understood because they had used that they used that even in in in their daily life I won't say daily life but they were acquainted with the act of anointing but now it was taking a whole spiritual becoming very very sacred and to the Hebrews they understood that anointing in the sacred sense when something was being anointed it was being consecrated and the and the fact the very Act of the anointing upon the individual especially when it was on an individual their understanding was and this is really fundamental to the message this morning as it was to the last two messages but I I want to really nail this down is because God in his people which were the Hebrews they understood that when something was anointed in the in another realm in the Divine realm they understood that something from God was being transferred from the Divine one to that individual and so now you want to think of this transferral because the message this morning I want to consider this incredible transferral that from the beginning in the beginning was the word I want to start from the beginning or from the Eternal one transferal from him came the word in the beginning was the word but in the very beginning there there was God alone the prophet describes him I'm not going to spend a lot of time in it but he was alone God by himself and from him came the logos or the word logos is simply the Greek term for word and then that word came and was made flesh that was transferred on further down oh the grace that brought it down to man and now it's it's it's a transferral and it came on down into man and from Christ into Spirit form and from Spirit form into a people it's a great operation that God had in his mind that is the the that that's why we have that I idea that concept of the anointing and this was the concept they had that when something was anointed it was something all away from the Divine one through some process that God had in his mind to bring it and and transferring something that was actually Divine holy sacred to that individual amen Ignatius say says this for there is one God who made himself manifest through Jesus Christ his son who is his logos proceeding from his silence saying Ignatius is bringing the thought that God was silent but now he brings forth a voice he brings forth a sound through Jesus Christ this process I don't know if God was silent or not but that is what ignacius had said Jesus said I've proceeded from God and when he used the word proceed proceeded it isn't just that I've come forth from God or that I've come forth to proceed we say well to proceed is to make progress to go forward and to have motion proceed but when Jesus used the word it was not just to say that there was movement but it was to identify where the movement commenced and that is why he said I have proceeded and come forth from God he identified where he he came from I proceeded forth and came forth from God and as the father hath sent me so send I you we are to know emphatically where we came from we didn't originate we didn't originate in our mother's womb we didn't originate in our father's sperm we originated in the mind of God we came from God Jesus knew that Jesus never identified himself say I come from Mary's womb I come from God hallelujah it's a great plan a great operation I've come from God and I go to God it is I've proceeded I have come from one place to another I've come down I've made my appearance and thus Jesus was anointed brother brandham said in and show us the father in Tom's service on Wednesday night I was so so very blessed and I know that you were as well and he he was speaking on show us the father and it sufficeth us and I thought it was just really marvelous how he was bringing the thought from it sufficeth us it will be sufficient it's enough that's what I need and whatever our situation was just to repeat a little of his words whatever whatever your situation is today he used it for Wednesday I'll use it for this morning whatever wherever you're at spiritually or materially or physically or any other way but just show us the father and that'll be sufficient all we need to do is see him all you need to do you don't need to see me you don't need to see your friends your peers you don't need to see who you're have so much wonderful fellowship with in the church you need to see him and that'll suffice that'll be sufficient we need to say that's all that I really need and in that message show us the father uh brother brandham he said let's take a little trip he he's actually making this a a a drama let's take a little trip to see who he was and he said you can find out whether God was in his son or not take a little trip and it goes a 100 million years before there was ever a star in the sky there was God and God was there then and I'm I'm abbreviating some of this he says and then the Loos and don't get lost when we just say that the word now he's giving the process and then the logos went out from God which was Christ the anointing that went out and I haven't been able to escape this for the last weeks the logos this great Eternal being the Divine One the god that fills all times with the God that's so mysterious that you couldn't begin to understand him I couldn't begin to understand him but he wants to be known he wants to reveal himself he wants to have Fellowship brother Brandon said Jesus when he was here on Earth he only asked for one thing for our fellowship why because he came forth from God he proceeded from God had the he was the attribute of God he wanted fellowship if we could grasp that and so he came forth from God and the Loos went out of God which was Christ the anointing that went out so no wonder the Jews or the Hebrews had that understanding that something was being transferred I've looked into what some other Scholars have said about the anointing and about the logos and about the great Eternal one and I can tell you that no one and I have I've read some things that make your head spin a bit but when a prophet comes he can say it in such a way so that you can you can actually grasp a hold of it you've got something that you can sink your teeth into you can get around it with your mind and even though it may jar us a little bit yet it it it it captivates you it's so wonderful and so when he begins to say the anointing that went out and now he said no man he said we're standing on the banister watching The Creation come into existence and see whether he was his son whether see whether he's his son now but now watch this transferral the logos the word went out from this great being brother B say another place perhaps a little light we see it it starts to circle out and it's the logos it's something coming out from God but now what's in the mind of God because now that is why the Jews had this this something is being transferred and what this transferral now comes and what we have in the the scripture in the beginning in the beginning was the word but this the Bible says tells us in the beginning and God said let there be and we find now that it begins to transfer the transferal comes into a creation and I don't want to go in uh spend a lot of time on it but he began to transfer life he chose and selected this planet that we're on oh my this molten Mass this little speck of nothing is it we the prophet calls it a clinker that perhaps flew off the sun this little here we're sitting today and we're all part of what came out of the ashes out of the remains and God was making in his mind was making a structured person he was laying out his 2x4s like a contractor making the uh calcium and the potassium and whatever more goes in to make up our bodies that we're sitting in here today God had us in his mind billions of years ago if there is such a thing do you believe that and now he's bringing it and now he begins to transfer himself it begins to transfer life and the and the prophet said he he spoke because because there were seeds down there the seeds were buried let there be light because there had to be something that the light could re that the seeds could respond to and so light comes light is born in a region that is that this Earth can respond to and he's chosen this Earth and he's actually anointing the Earth as it were because he's pouring out he's pouring out the whole born of his creative power upon the Earth this Earth and then he says let the Earth bring forth what's he doing he's transferring something that went out from himself it went out of the bosom of almighty God it was the logos it was the word and the word spoke and now I doubt if he spoke English I doubt if he spoke Hebrew I don't know what he said I don't know how it was but it was an utterance let the Earth bring forth and the Earth began to bring forth something from this logos was transferred to the very Earth and out of the earth began to grow herb and trees and all manner of things and flowers of the field and it it it just blossomed with a massive amount of life because it was coming out of the bosom of God can you say amen and that wasn't sufficient he had more in his bosom and so he said let the waters bring forth and the waters came alive I don't care whether it took a million 10 million or 100 million years had nothing to do I don't care how it happened but it happened and that's how it happened because God said let it bring forth and the animal kingdom came forth and Higher and Higher and Higher came this because God is transferring it's like he's anointing the Earth with life he's transferring upon it pouring out the Horn of his life and then he must have his own image there and he makes a man let us make man in our image and and when he had done that there was no no one to till the ground man was made in the image of God God is a spirit Jesus said so he must make a man to till the ground and to care for the earth and the garden and he brings forth and forms him out of the earth out of the elements and there was a body and then the scripture says and he breathed into man into his nostrils and Man became a living soul soul that is different from just spoken word he spoke his word and the Earth brought forth he spoke his word and the waters brought forth he spoke his word and all of the life came forth all the levels of Life came forth but he never breathed into them it was this breath that separated the man from all other even though it all came out of God came out of the very bosom of God he's expressing himself but he breathed into him and Man became a living soul and Jesus when they had heard his word they heard the spoken word and they had the spoken word of the prophets but it required something further and he told them as a father ha sent me as a father have sent me so send I you as I have come out of the father as I have proceeded out from God that's how I am sending you I came from the bosom of God and you are just an extension of that coming forth and now I send you exactly as I have been sent out I send you I came out from God I am a I've been transferred from God out of God out of his very bosom out of his very attributes I've been sent out and as I've been sent I send you you have no more to you have no more right to doubt that than Jesus had to doubt that he came out of God you have no right to doubt that and when when he had said this when he had said this he breathed on them and said receive ye the Holy Ghost it wasn't sufficient even to say it just to say it they knew that they must go and T they must go and wait and there would be something that would literally take place and with and there was a r rushing Mighty Wind and that filled the whole place and they were all filled with the Holy Ghost and at that moment that 120 was the only 120 on the earth that was different from all other mankind Hallelujah even as Adam was different from everything else from all other all others had life but these had a different kind of Life the transferral of God himself of his own breath of his own life of his own nature of his own own character come into the people and that is still in force today and that is what's needed amongst the Believers of this message is the transferral not just to hear a tape not just to read a book but to have the author of the book To Breathe Into You the breath and I want to tell you whatever you think of me or whatever anyone whoever hears this service here what I have to say and this I believe that when God when he spoke and creation came and so on then he began to speak directly to a people in the mountain God speaking to the people and the people came to the pro Prophet Moses was already a prophet they came to Moses their prophet and said don't have God speak to us we can't bear this let God speak to you and you speak to us and so God agreed he complied and now that was the first instance now we have a vessel God decreed that a vessel a human vessel shall be his it will be his uh uh conduit is as I if I can say it that way it will be his his his method his process to convey his breath from himself to the people and so he would have His prophets his seers sometimes they were called seers and again I refer to brother Tom's message on Wednesday whenever God would do something to manifest himself a remarkable way he would have a sear to identify that changing of his mask and when we grasp the principle then we can trans then we can in our minds take that principle and move it up to the present time God he had to now he had is part of his Pro and he knew that before the foundation of the world that this would take place and so now God raises up prophets and the prophets become his instrument through which his breath will flow amen it's not through their mind it is simply through their mouth and Moses spoke one language brother brandham spoke another language The Messengers spoke other languages Paul spoke another language he spoke more than one language but it all was the same thing God transferring what was coming out of him what the Hebrews call an anointing God he in he impregnated his word with his life you could not separate the life of God from the word of God you could say the word is his life and the life of his is his word it's synonymous it's one and the same so God infused he impregnated his word with his own life and then breathed that word through His prophets it was actually the Breath of God so when you receive that not just when you read it with your eyes or hear it with your physical ears but when you receive it in your soul then that life that's why Jesus said the word is the seed it has within it it has all a compound uh uh uh all the compounds That's essential for bringing forth whatever that word in it season said and that is why Jesus could take in Luke 4 and say the spirit of the Lord hath anointed me to preach the gospel to heal a broken hearted to lose the prisoners because that word was for him and to preach the acceptable year the Lord this day is this scripture fulfilled in your ears and that promised word which was prophesied by Malachi and by Isaiah was in him and it came forth to life in him he received it he did not receive a message for a Rapture taking a whole group of people into a body change but the prophet the Prophet uh Paul he gave that prophetic seed and God breathed out from him in seed form those promises that we shall not all sleep but we shall all be changed I ask you who was that for who was that intended for who who who who what what was the purpose of God speaking that who is it for and then comes a sear a prophet seer in the end time and shows a sign of the resurrection and says now is the time this is the season my friends whether I see it or not you want to believe that with all your heart to believe it is to receive it to believe it is to be the recipient to doubt it is death to doubt it you'll still go to church to doubt it you may still speak in tongues to doubt it you still play in a Orchestra to doubt it you can still sing songs that has nothing to do with it you'll miss it but that word is infused pregnated with the Rapture life and it in itself already is Anointed you know just little thoughts along the side in the Bible God told them anoint the altar anoint it with oil and they did and had and because I can say the Earth to me couldn't find where brother brandham said it but in my studies the earth to me was like God's altar because here on the earth doesn't say he poured out his Spirit on the Sun or poured out out a spirit on the moon or poured out a spirit on Pluto or Jupiter or Saturn or other galaxies we have no record but his Spirit moved over the face of the Earth Hallelujah moved and the prophet said he CED he brooded he CED in love and he brooded upon the face of the Earth why because he loved the water no because what was in the Earth you were laying there Hallelujah you were laying there do you believe that and there's many that are asleep in the earth and the same holy spirit is cooing over this Earth waiting on that promise I'm going to bring them forth Hallelujah I'm going to bring them forth we shall not all sleep but those that are asleep in Christ shall be first raised will first be raised do you know anybody that's going to be raised are you looking for somebody that's going to be raised they'll first be raised Hallelujah and then we which are alive and remain here's the seed here's the seed shall be changed in a moment in a twinkling of an eye is that your promise that was in seed form and now we're in the manifestation part of it and we received the sign received the prophet Seer who the Breath of God could come through that is why that Ministry is so different and you know the altar also had to be sprinkled with blood and this Earth as God's altar was sprinkled with blood his own blood says I'll make it a new blood I'll create blood again and it'll be sprinkled spattered on the earth I'll claim that little speck of dust out in its orbit friends this would just be some star and even scientists that try to understand try to understand this Earth they try to understand these things try to understand our place in the universe and in the in the tens of billions billions of galaxies if you go into it you just get lost if you go into it as a Believer you're bound to say God How Great Thou Art you're bound to say how did you you ever find me how are you aware of me that God should think of me that God should be concerned that I'm a sinner that God should be concerned about my need that God should be concerned I have a pain I have a sickness I have a disease that God should be so concerned I'll come down I'll condescend down and I'll make a way where you can be free of your guilt free of your sin free of your disease free of oh the grace that brought it down to man tell you what friends if I shut this service down right now and you didn't praise him I'd say you'd be nigh unto a sinner how can a how can a redeemed one hold their peace how can you fully understand what he did and be at peace and be silent no God now has put something in the people God desires worship and we're here to worship Him Hallelujah the concept or the understanding of the anointing even before the beginning and that's where I've brought you from in I tried to bring you along and then I want to just give you uh another thought if you could for a moment follow with me you see Jesus saying I proceeded forth from God I would like you to see him as the branch coming forth from the stock and the Bible says of him Isaiah speaking he said and there shall come forth A Rod or the rod the word in the Hebrews actually a branch there shall come forth a branch or another meaning is a twig out of the stem which is the trunk or the stock of J and a branch shall grow out of his roots Jesus was like in his coming here is like a a branch of Jesse a twig coming forth and then Jesus would say I am the True Vine my father's the husbandman and if there's a True Vine something that is is is very unique in brother Brand's Ministry and I I'm just giving this to you I'm sewing this thought because you've run into it many many times and it has a great deal of meaning to me because I was when I was with brother brandom I was really quite I was distressed I guess would be the right word at all the anointed things that I saw took place and I made reference to them before I heard prophecies that were not accurate did not happen happened and they were anointed and I couldn't understand it and great manifestations saw Miracles and other things I saw three deaf and dumb persons in a man's meeting in a small handful of people compared to brother bram's meetings or or Roberts's meetings or Tommy Hicks or Tommy osbor or any of these other men we always think of the big tents and the big big auditoriums but this was out in the field out in the open and over a period I think of two or three days in two small towns both in British Columbia I saw three deaf and dumb persons prayed for by a man I still remember his name I won't name it just now and he was from California a preacher only saw him then never saw him again he he took control of that demon and cast that deaf and dumb Spirit out and had that person hear and speak right there at the platform and I was about 15 I never forgot that anointed absolutely and was that from God absolutely is from God and I wouldn't ident I wouldn't I'm not making any reference to this brother I believe he's a very Godly Man very fine man but with all even today you think anointed singing we hear anointed singing and anointed preaching and anointed because Jesus said in the last days in the last days it would be so close so as to deceive the very elect if possible it was so it's going to be so close and you won't find it anywhere else you just don't find it but now brother Brandon brings false anointed ones and that has such a significant place in my life in my experience because I sat there on that log and had him when I raised the question and he said have you heard my tape or my message on false anointed ones and I felt bad and I felt somewhat embarrassed that I had not heard it I had heard a few tapes but not many and uh so I said no I haven't heard it so then he went into the scriptures and in the scriptures one of the scriptures was in the last days sayth God I will pour out what is it pouring out it's like an anointing I will pour out my spirit upon all and brother Brandon when he came to that he said I'll pour out my spirit upon and I said all I answered because he waiting for the answer I said all and he said a l l flesh but not all flesh is saved I said that is correct he said the wheat and the tears you remember the parable yes I said he said you tell me what the wheat what caused the wheat to grow what caused the wheat to Rejoice what caused what gave the wheat strength and I'll tell you what the tears rejoiced in because they both had the same source and he went through two more scriptures and then I tell you what friends it was like an explosion took place and I also said to myself I said to myself I felt very very uh humbled because I said to myself you have read those scriptures hundreds of times why haven't we why haven't I seen that before and then I realized that the word coming in its season out of the right mouth had a different had a whole different power to it and it was the same scripture it just took on a whole new scope a whole new meaning and then when you get into false anointed ones you'll find in several places he'll say now he was to this brother's place and there's a a citrus tree an orange tree and in there is growing lemons and grapefruit and tangelos and several other fruits but they're all citrus and the branches are all growing out of this orange tree and brother brandham says well how is that how can they all be manifesting these other things and he says well because that's what they are that's the branch they are oh he says so now next year next year these will all grow oranges he said oh no no the lemon Branch will bring a lemon and the tangelo will bring a tangelo and the grapefruit will bring it even next year yes it'll keep on bringing that but it's drawing life from the vine it's drawing life from the tree and now this whole series of messages has actually erupted from this next phrase which he makes and whether it is that service whether it is Anointed ones false anointed ones but he he makes this statement they have the life like that but then his statement is but they're bearing false witness to the tree and that's why I said the anointing that came out from God the purpose of that is to bring a true evidence to the tree Hallelujah so when Jesus came he could sign the True Vine because he was bringing forth a true evidence the anointing he said the spirit of the Lord is upon me because he hath anointed me he was anointed not only to bring evidence but to bring a true evidence of the the original stock and my brother my sister you're ordained you are ordained by God God's purpose to bring this message is to let it come into your heart and to anoint it by the holy spirit so that you will bring a true evidence a true evidence you're anointed to bring forth a true evidence of the original vine Hallelujah that's why he sent this word we're not just here to be another church we're not just here to be identified as as a some kind of a group of people we have been ordained by God we're not here to bring forth a Baptist Branch a Pentecostal Branch a Catholic Branch they may all get their life from that vine but there are those that come from an original twig an original branch and that original Branch will always bring forth oranges it'll bring forth the original life how many believe that and that branch that life has been ordained for the Rapture because I came from God and I returned back to God youve got to believe that you believe that Hallelujah there shall come forth a branch Hallelujah that's why Jesus could go on and say Jesus coming forth who was the word himself proceeded out from God he was the Breath of God hallelujah he was not a prophet of God he was the god Prophet prophets of God were instruments through which the Breath of God could come but Jesus Christ was the word he was the very Breath of God in him was life Hallelujah and that life was the light of man but other prophets came and they were instruments through which the Breath of God came was breathed through and then that's why brother Brandon makes a distinction he says now he he said when you hear that thus sayith the lord it's not me speaking that's a different breath Hallelujah you follow me you know just to make it clear Jesus did not say some things for example that brother brandham said brother brandom could say oh I've just made so many mistakes there's a man I've made so many you never hear Jesus saying I've made so many mistakes brother Bram said I was a sinner I repented of my sins you never hear Jesus say that Jesus said my blood is drink indeed and my flesh is meat indeed brother Brandon couldn't say that you understand one was the glos himself and the other was a vessel of the logos it's important to understand that because people go on both sides then some people use those maybe statements similar to mine and say well there was a difference and you only you only pay attention to what brother bandam said when he said thus sayi the Lord I don't accept that I don't accept that either I probably should you know people have used that ministers have used that sadly because they wanted to go toodling off on their own Direction they had their own Revelation and they end off way off in some Wilderness and the sad part is I wouldn't mind if they want to go writing off there but they take a whole group of people with them and it's really sad saying well you know the try to indicate in fur that the message is unreliable the message isn't unreliable friends it's an absolute to us it is the revelation of God's word to us but it'll always harmonize with the word always harmonize with the word and so my desire for the congregation here my desire for this congregation is that we will bear and I've been I've been praying for you I hope you've been praying for me praying for you as a congregation appreciating you as a congregation and the message I've just been listening to testimony of a true witness brother Bram has just lost his mother and I was with him just before that and he had the vision of the hunt and everything and then he explained to the people in another service right after his mother departed that God gave him that hunt to comfort him in what he was going to be facing but when he comes in November of 61 I believe it is he comes and he's just lost his mother and that is he spent so much of the service on how how what he thought of his mother and what his mother meant to him and how she was just such a he goes back back into her conversations that he had with her and then he began to thank the people you know he I you can just see he becomes so Melancholy and he becomes so expressive to the people it's like he's talking to them one on one and tells them how much he loved them and and thank you for coming and sitting with mother and thank you for being there with me and being there for our time of grief and he goes on and on and on it takes a long time in the service but he's preaching on a testimony of a true witness and I'd like to say to you I just pray my prayer to God for this congregation is we don't have another church to be our example we don't have any other place to be our example our example must be a word message-based example and live by that and I say oh God I wouldn't want to lab laed all this 34 35 years and then and then end up with a say a group of people or a church not worried about you so much as worried about you know the influence that the world has and the influence of our jobs and the influence just of of the whole civilization that we're we're we're forced to live in the influence of your schools young people the influence of your friends the influence of the fashion industry the influence of the sports the influence that is so infiltrates every part of our life you can't even hardly move or turn around before you can feel that impact of that influence your neighbors and your work people that you work with and all over I pray that God will by his divine grace allow you my precious brothers and sisters my precious young people that we will when all is said and done and you surely will stand also before him that you will hear his voice well done you have borne you did Bear a true evidence of the tree of life you bore a true evidence you were not a false witness to this tree you were a true witness to this tree amen amen the Bible says then said Jesus to them again peace be unto you as I would like to say exactly as PR precisely as the father hath sent me I've proceeded out from God I've come out of the booom of God as he came out so have you come out I want to take you back not just in some mental picture but in reality long before your great grandfathers and mothers and your lineage way way back to the many many countries that are represented here long before that listen to me you young people especially sitting here with your mother and dad God bless them how we thank God for Godly Parents but long before that if you could only see if you could only recognize it you're believing the words of your lord Jesus as I came from God as I've been sent even sent with a purpose somebody I was just talking to in this congregation don't see them but they're probably sitting here listening to me I don't have permission to say this but I'm going to say it been on my heart very very much I've been aware for some months God dealing with a man in this congregation very very deeply when he's out on relaxation he's carrying his a Bible and I met him on occasion when he was on a relaxation on vacation he was carrying his Bible had his Bible in the vehicle and he starts to tell me about how God is speaking to him out of his out of the scriptures and he's weeping he can't hold himself together and he's weeping I and I see now months have gone by and I've Just Seen A Change transformation in this man I had a conversation with him this last week maybe two weeks ago and he was driven to prayer he said my house is busy children in the house but he said I found a place under the stairs and I've made a room where I can be alone with God on another occasion this isn't flashing the pan do not come up to the front and be prayed for and walk away and forget all about it another occasion I'm being waked up early in the morning and I felt even sometimes in the night I just need to get out and pray and I start praying he said I think I'll only pray for maybe a short time before I know it it's daylight and he has to work and he has to work hard it's going week in week out week week in week out not long ago in the last few weeks he's not preaching to his wife he's not trying to bring anything down bring her into subjection he just concerned told me yesterday all I want to talk about I just want to I want to be with you he said I just want to talk about the Lord I just want everything you can tell me about God and his wife is in the house and has some kind of experience and God comes upon her and speaks to her and says to her Jesus Christ is in your husband I said what is happening to you there's a purpose in that now you must scan as it were to know the mind of God what are you doing this for and what is the purpose I said there's someone else perhaps in the congregation here to have an effect on and I said what I'm praying I'm praying oh God let that be the experience not of one but of others I feel like God is doing something I've had you speak I've had you email I've had phone calls and I myself know the word is different I know that God is doing something different I'm hearing the other brothers Minister and God is dealing with our congregation if I was to go off the scene today I'd want you to remember God is dealing with this congregation in a different way you believe that you feel it don't you you sense it it's something deep within you know I believe it is I believe it's a Rapture word I I believe it's the anointed word for Rapture I believe that what God is doing is getting a people ready to leave it's not just a song it's not just a song getting ready to leave but it's something that's taking place that has to do so our examples aren't out in the world it's not in the street it's not in the mall it's not where we work it's not in the school it's not in the college our example is in the word and the word has called us to such a depth in him and I believe that that word which came was breathed out of God created the creation of this earth when our bodies were still in the soil and sent his word down through his vessels through his Prophets The Breath of God to the people in seed form then it came to its manifested form and God sent a messenger in the end time Prophet m messenger through whom he could transmit the very Breath of God so Jesus could say as I have been sent as I have been sent of the father so send I you does the congregation understand what's in my spirit and soul today you have been sent by God you don't look back at just where you came from or your Heritage here on Earth you've issued out from the bosom of God and God knew you were going to be here knew you were going to sit here in this meeting knew you were going to hear this thinging you came from God to be an expression of God on the earth and to Bear a true witness of the vine Hallelujah do you agree with that Hallelujah that's what we're here for it's an incredible time that we're living in friends and I pray that the spirit of God just keeps urging us on further that tomorrow will not be as yesterday and next week won't be like this week and that you will be used of God to have such an effect and such an influence hallelujah how far can we go who knows there is no limits we're birthed by God some here no doubt do not have that baptism I'm not speaking about the gift now I'm talking about the person himself coming into the individual and it's not something we you know it's not something that we determine within ourselves but there's one thing that we can do and that is you can create an atmosphere you can allow God to give a hunger in your heart down into your soul a craving if you haven't got it you can that's one thing you can do you have a voice you have something that can express your heart do you have a real desire for God then if I were you I would tell him so I say I have such a thirst for you such a hunger for you I will put my mind and my thoughts I will focus upon you I'll keep thinking about you I'll keep thinking about the promise of this time I won't let it get far from me [Music] Hallelujah I'm going to close early I want to close in this atmosphere so I look across the congregation and now when I make my next statement make the next few comments I do not want you to think of you know perhaps the little difficulties that you have we all have difficulties we all have those we have financial difficulties we have you know just life life is a can be Troublesome we all have that but I begin to ask myself this last week what is the anointing for what is this I can see I can see it all happen I hope I've been I've hope I've been able to dramatize it a we bit do you believe it you believe it you believe it come out of the bosom of God here come you know brother br's trying to describe it to Here Comes This Little Light it's the logos out of this great being that is so completely under Indescribable cannot be understood Here Comes This Little Light and it comes transferring out of the bosom of God let there be light brother Bram said if there was a Mist that came it wasn't the word of God let the Earth bring forth let the waters bring forth all the living kind and Animal Kingdom let us make man in our image now he begin he's transferring himself now he's got one that looks like him just like him my son you'll be the god of the earth then the fall and the sin and the death and the Earth that he made has been bathed in blood cruel blood but the scripture says the righteous blood of Abel the blood of Jesus speaks better things than that and then God now out of his bosom he's got to bring the redemp plan he going to redeem this back I cannot lose it I cannot be God and lose this and he's going to bring the Redemptive plan and that's that very lust that went out from him sets in motion the Redemption and now he begins to act it out and play it out and he brings his Masterpiece Christ Christ himself was the logos just here for a little brief moment of time and he leaves and his Spirit comes into a 120 and they're birthed they're different kind of people they're God people there never been people like this on the earth they're even different from the prophets the prophet had the word going through them but now these were born born born by God they were birthed by God and Jesus because God himself breathed when the creation was finished finished God breathed into Adam and he became a living soul and when the new creation was finished Jesus breathed on the disciples receive ye the Holy Ghost showing that he was the beginning of the new creation but in him it was completed it was done and he breathed on them receive ye the Holy Ghost and now these 120 and now God begin to live in a people bringing and claiming back all that was his from the very beginning and so that breath that was breathed into US I've received that breath you have received that breath if you haven't here if you're not if you have not received that breath set yourself aside say I I I need to receive that very very Breath of God a newborn creature in Christ Jesus that's what it's about and friends I'll tell you I can go back in my life and this person I was speaking to you're listening real close I want to really bear it down I said to this individual the one thing that happened with with you is it's over there's no more Struggle No More struggle I'm not going to say this because we're strong people I and my wife we lack we have many many lacks I could go on a confession time right now and confess you know that we have a lot of weaknesses and yet you know because I don't know whether it's because the ministry what it is but my wife and I have never never been to a minister for counseling we've never been to anyone for counseling God has been our counsel I'll tell you part of that is when you settled it and you were born of the spirit of God you got the very Source within you and then it's all over and that's what you need that's what a person needs my brother my sister I'm not opposed to I love to sit down and counsel with people to give you any kind of wisdom that I can but I can tell you friends that we have a source amen we have a source do you believe it we have a source the almighty God is our source and when you have that kind of a experience in Christ by the holy spirit it's all over it's all over you mean we won't have a tough time we'll have hard times but you'll go straight through it you'll go straight through it you believe that you will indeed go straight through it he won't be up today down tomorrow save today lost Tomorrow there's no such a thing without God we've been born by God and we know I came from the bosom of the father and whether you're called home today or tomorrow this week next week some people just wanting to get out of the world I want to be here as long long as he wants me here I want to be a testimony I want to be a powerful testimony I don't care if this whole Pacific Northwest thinks we're a bunch of Fanatics up here I don't care what I'm not going to be a fanatic for the sake of being a fanatic but we want to be what he wants us to be I want to Bear a true witness to the vine Hallelujah and this is what it says I'm closing in just a couple minutes and it shall come to pass in that day Isaiah said that his burden shall be taken away from off thy shoulder and his yoke from off thy neck and the Yoke shall be destroyed because of the anointing one thing the anointing will do you may have some yoke you may have something that has pressed you down you may have something that Satan has used against you I will announce to you today unequivocally and without any apology the word that has come has the power to break that yoke it is the anointing it is the Breath of God it's a very Breath of God and we have maybe personal things in our lives and say oh God oh God where's the Deliverance for it the Deliverance is right here it doesn't have to be some special you know tional thing that you have you've just got to believe it to disbelieve it is to carry your yoke on you'll continue on with the Yoke on you but if you believe it the Yoke the anointing will break the Yoke does somebody need it I'm here to do business with God you want that Yol broken you can stand to your feet and God will break that yoke at this moment don't be as ashamed and don't be don't be embarrassed that's what that came for to break that yoke you believe the word you believe the word and the anointing will break the Yoke you've received an anointed word now you pray you pray you call on them forget who's beside you whether it's your wife or husband or who it is you pray break that Yoke the name of Jesus Christ I have received the word I have received the promised word I have received the breath of the almighty God In The Name of Jesus Christ receive it now receive it now let that yoke be broken I can tell you friends Satan is fighting as hardest right now you deny him don't you let him lie to you don't you let him say it's going to be the same you say it's going to be different it's going to be different that yoke is broken the anointing which I've received breaks that [Music] yoke going to pray with you father I know you will not deny this people you will not deny your word you will deny Satan any opportunity for victory here this morning you'll deny the powers of Darkness oh how he wants to fight oh how he wants to resist oh he wants to procrastinate and now Lord Jesus you identified him you said he's a liar from the beginning Satan you are a liar and we are not influenced by your lies we're not influenced by your presence we're not influenced by your resistance in the name of Jesus we declare your head has been crushed your reasoning we do not accept your lies our ears are closed to we have accepted the word of the Lord and by that word we have received what we have come for Lord we believe that we have proceeded from God We Believe As the father sent you and you said so send I you we've been sent into this Earth at this season we were sent to hear what we have heard we've been sent to be born in the homes we were born in we've been sent to be gathered together in this company of

up and examined and he was found perfect it wasn't only pilate who could say I find no fault in this man but you looked upon him you were satisfied with the sacrifice you were pleased with the sacrifice and sin's grip was broken over the face of the Earth and man could come now to full Redemption and here we are standing today at the end of the ages as it we almost feeling like we're on the balcony looking into eternity standing here in time but we're leaning forward we're looking over the banisters that wear and we see a great Eternal Horizon that is Risen Lord and we hear marvelous words that come to us through the prophetic voice that you sent we hear descriptions of you oh God that no one seems to be able to to say it like that and we hear glorious things about your bride Lord we identify ourselves with that those descriptions I pray that you will go with these people and I ask oh God if there's any person that yet has been untouched and do not feel that moving within them I ask Lord that you will deal with them in such a way move close to them Lord make yourself so present with them and set up a hunger and a desire within their heart Lord I pray I pray that there will will be a great great transformation some here need it more than others Lord I just pray they'll identify it word that's why we preach that's why I preach this morning Lord I've done what I could do
