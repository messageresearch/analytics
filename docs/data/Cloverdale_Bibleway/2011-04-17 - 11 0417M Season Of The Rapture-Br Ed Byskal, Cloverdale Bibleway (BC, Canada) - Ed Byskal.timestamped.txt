[15:04] Let's hold that before the throne of
[15:06] grace this morning. He's a miracle
[15:08] working God. His wonders to perform.
[15:11] Heavenly Father, we believe in the
[15:12] resurrection. You said, "I am the
[15:15] resurrection and the life. He that
[15:17] believeth in me, though he were dead,
[15:19] yet shall he live." Lord, we have heard
[15:21] that same voice, the voice from the
[15:24] excellent glory of God. Lord, we've seen
[15:27] you high and lifted up in the revelation
[15:29] of your word. We have come to the house
[15:31] of God to join our licks of fire to give
[15:35] you glory, to give you honor, and to
[15:37] give you praise this morning. We can say
[15:40] you are a miracle working God. Your
[15:43] wonders to perform. And Lord, you are
[15:46] the same yesterday, today, and forever.
[15:49] Lord, you came in Jericho. You left
[15:50] Jericho, but there was a blind man that
[15:53] was waiting there for the son of David.
[15:56] Lord, there's many this morning. We are
[15:58] waiting for the move of the Holy Ghost
[16:01] to meet the needs of your children once
[16:04] again. So with uplifted hands, we cry
[16:07] out to you. Living God, meet our needs
[16:10] this morning. Anoint us to believe for
[16:14] all things are possible to them that
[16:17] believe. Lord, these requests that have
[16:19] been spoken, hands that are raised, a
[16:22] pastor that will come, anoint us, Lord,
[16:25] to receive the promises of God.
[16:29] Hallelujah.
[16:30] You are the same God that spoke to that
[16:34] raging Red Sea. But we can say this
[16:37] morning by your revelation, that same
[16:40] God is living in me. So we speak healing
[16:46] in the name of Jesus Christ. We speak
[16:49] deliverance
[16:50] for the glory of God. Lord, we take you
[16:54] at your promise this morning. Lord
[16:56] Jesus, we ask that you will touch
[16:58] everyone in divine presence that they
[17:01] will not leave the house of God sick,
[17:04] but they will go healed
[17:06] for the glory of God and every request
[17:08] that was spoken. Pray Lord that you will
[17:11] have your divine will and way. Charge
[17:14] your people Lord with the Holy Ghost and
[17:17] fire. Lord, we don't want formality. We
[17:20] want the moving of God. We desire the
[17:23] word to stimulate us Lord.
[17:28] Hallelu from the youngest to the oldest.
[17:34] May the Holy Ghost move.
[17:39] We love you this morning.
[17:43] &gt;&gt; Ask me not, oh gentle savior. Hear our
[17:46] humble cry.
[17:49] Lord, deep needs are here.
[17:52] Souls need to be saved.
[17:55] Deliverance is here.
[17:58] Those that need deliverance. Father, you
[17:59] are the mighty horn of Israel. You are
[18:03] our deliverer and our savior.
[18:07] Let the joy of God permeate this
[18:09] building.
[18:11] &gt;&gt; And Father, let the victory of Christ be
[18:13] our portion.
[18:17] &gt;&gt; We love your people. We pray God that
[18:19] you will have your divine will and way
[18:21] now.
[18:23] &gt;&gt; Anoint us to hear what the Holy Spirit
[18:26] would have us to hear now. We commit all
[18:29] things to you for your glory and honor
[18:32] in Jesus name. Amen. Amen.
[18:36] Amen. God bless you saints. You may have
[18:38] your seats this morning.
[18:42] Hallelujah.
[18:44] Wonderful atmosphere
[18:46] that you can create
[18:49] and I appreciate that very much.
[18:54] Sister Okeello's got a special for us
[18:56] this morning. Believe it's a song that
[18:58] she's just recently sang. So maybe she
[19:00] can come and bless us with a special
[19:03] this morning. We're going to turn right
[19:04] to the word and give our pastor as much
[19:06] time as he needs this morning to deliver
[19:10] the thought that the Lord has laid upon
[19:12] his heart. I believe it's the burden of
[19:13] the word, the hour in which we're living
[19:15] in. It's pertinent today.
[19:17] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[19:18] &gt;&gt; Amen. Maybe we can sing my redeemer is
[19:21] faithful and true as she's coming to get
[19:22] ready.
[19:26] &gt;&gt; My redeemer
[19:30] is faithful and true.
[19:35] Everything
[19:37] he has said, he will do.
[19:45] Every morning
[19:47] his mercies are new.
[19:53] My redeemer
[19:56] is faithful
[19:58] and true.
[20:01] My red redeemer
[20:04] is faithful and true.
[20:10] Everything he has said he will do.
[20:19] Every morning
[20:22] his mercy for you.
[20:28] I believe her is faithful
[20:32] and true.
[20:35] Bless you this morning.
[20:54] I've stood on the bank of a wide raging
[20:59] river, trusting that I'd get across.
[21:06] I've made my way through some valleys
[21:10] and deserts, believing I'd never get
[21:15] lost.
[21:16] Lo, I've stood at the foot of what felt
[21:21] like Mount Everest, knowing I would have
[21:25] the strength for the climb.
[21:29] Through every trial, each test and
[21:33] temptation,
[21:35] one thing is sure every time.
[21:41] Over and over, again,
[21:46] God is faithful.
[21:50] Over and over, again,
[21:54] through it all, he's made me a able
[22:00] to stand and survive to come through a
[22:05] life when it sure looked like I wouldn't
[22:09] win.
[22:12] Jesus is with me. I'll claim the victory
[22:18] over and over again.
[22:25] If you ask me why, I have no hesitation.
[22:30] God does what he says he will do.
[22:37] I'd simply say every battle has taught
[22:41] me there's nothing he won't take me
[22:45] through.
[22:47] So why should I dwell on the hardships
[22:51] and struggles when I look just beyond
[22:55] them I see
[22:59] the way this will end is with great
[23:02] celebration.
[23:04] And deep in my heart I believe
[23:10] over and over again and again. God is
[23:16] faithful.
[23:18] Over and over again again and again.
[23:23] Through it all. He's made me able
[23:29] to stand and survive. to come through a
[23:33] life when it sure looked like I couldn't
[23:38] win.
[23:41] Jesus is with me. I'll claim the victory
[23:46] over and over again.
[23:52] Over and over again and again. Lord,
[23:57] you're faithful.
[24:00] Over and over, again and again, through
[24:05] it all. You've made me able
[24:11] to stand and survive. To come through
[24:15] alive when it sure look like I couldn't
[24:20] win.
[24:22] Jesus, you're with me. I'll claim the
[24:26] victory over
[24:29] over again.
[24:33] Yes, Jesus is with us. We'll claim it
[24:37] victory
[24:42] over
[24:43] over again.
[25:01] Praise the Lord.
[25:03] Victory in the camp this morning. Amen.
[25:08] Why don't we sing the master of the
[25:09] wind?
[25:12] I know the master of the wind.

[26:14] the way
[26:17] because I know I know
[26:22] the way.
[26:28] I know.
[26:34] He
[26:38] made the sun to shine again.
[26:44] I know the master.
[26:50] &gt;&gt; Amen. Let's sing it once again. I know
[26:53] the master of the wind.
[27:00] I know the maker of the rain.
[27:08] He can call the storm and the sun to
[27:13] shine again.
[27:17] I know the master of the wind.
[27:23] I'm amazed that he loved me.
[27:26] Heat. Heat.
[27:38] Hey,

[27:59] away.
[28:04] Heat.
[28:12] Heat.

[28:28] Heat.
[28:38] I say all my things
[28:42] I want
[28:44] for you.
[28:49] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[28:59] &gt;&gt; We're approaching the
[29:04] &gt;&gt; We're approaching the Easter season.
[29:07] Hallelujah.
[29:10] &gt;&gt; On Tuesday starts a Passover for the
[29:13] Jewish people on Tuesday.
[29:16] And they're going to be remembering the
[29:18] whole week.
[29:20] And uh for the most part, they're
[29:21] blinded yet
[29:24] &gt;&gt; to really what happened
[29:27] &gt;&gt; that week. But here we approach the
[29:29] greatest week. Just think. And we're
[29:31] here to be able to rejoice. Amen.
[29:35] &gt;&gt; That's why our sins were all washed
[29:38] away.
[29:39] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And we're rejoicing in it.
[29:41] My my what glory and praise can go to
[29:46] our Lord Jesus Christ. And if any people
[29:49] can rejoice as those to whom he has
[29:51] revealed himself to. I am truly amazed.
[29:56] I'm amazed.
[30:04] Heat.
[30:08] Heat.
[30:18] Heat. Heat.
[30:30] Oh,
[30:51] heat, heat.
[30:56] Heat. Heat.
[31:18] Wonderful Lord Jesus.
[31:20] And with that on our lips and knowing
[31:22] that the Passover, we wanted to announce
[31:24] this earlier in the week because we
[31:27] generally like to have it announced
[31:28] ahead of time, but we're going to have
[31:30] communion tonight
[31:32] for those that can be here. We'd like to
[31:34] announce it a full week ahead so that
[31:36] the people in Seattle can come up and be
[31:39] with us. But I just was so heavy on my
[31:41] heart and we just asked, you know,
[31:43] brother Tom asked and spoke to the
[31:47] sister
[31:50] see if we can have the bread ready and
[31:52] that was on the spur of the moment. But
[31:54] I just want to have communion tonight.
[31:55] Amen.
[31:56] &gt;&gt; Lord's table foot washing. Brother John
[31:59] Landes is going to be speaking and uh so
[32:03] you want to be here if at all possible.
[32:07] Uh
[32:08] so that's this evening and we'll start
[32:10] right on time and make it as have
[32:13] perhaps a little shorter uh
[32:15] preliminaries.
[32:17] also those that are seeing the going
[32:21] through the school building and uh
[32:26] there are there are are I think about
[32:29] every half hour this afternoon is at
[32:31] every half hour starting about 2
[32:34] 2:00 and every half hour. So, if you
[32:38] want to go through, you they've asked
[32:40] you to sign up, but if you're haven't
[32:43] signed up, please
[32:45] let brother Kim
[32:48] uh show you what has been taking place.
[32:51] Most of you haven't been in the in that
[32:53] building, but a tremendous amount of
[32:55] work. And for those brothers that have
[32:58] given their time, and we just want to we
[33:00] don't know how to say thank you. God
[33:02] reward you. the people who have given,
[33:05] you have given, you've sacrificed
[33:08] in one way or another. And God
[33:12] uh God has helped us. Amen. He's helped
[33:15] us immensely.
[33:17] I want to say to you that if time should
[33:21] go on, and we don't know if it will, but
[33:24] if time should go on any length of time,
[33:27] there's young people who are in their
[33:31] coming up into their teens.
[33:35] And they will be not the church of
[33:37] tomorrow, but the church of today.
[33:40] really
[33:42] taking their position.
[33:48] had an email from brother Tim Andes and
[33:51] uh he let me know that he along with
[33:54] some other young people have been able
[33:55] to
[33:58] have been able to u load 100 Portuguese
[34:02] messages,
[34:05] &gt;&gt; excuse me, in four different formats
[34:09] in three days.
[34:11] And that's what like that's like a 100
[34:13] messages, four formats. That's 400.
[34:18] And I want to say God bless you.
[34:22] &gt;&gt; I'll probably make reference to it a wee
[34:24] bit in the scripture in the while in the
[34:27] ministry
[34:29] because uh that's the mission of the
[34:32] church.
[34:34] &gt;&gt; And I'll read a quote. Brother Brandham
[34:36] said, you know, God help Jefferson
[34:38] Tabernacle if they ever lose that
[34:40] vision.
[34:41] &gt;&gt; We're not just a church. We're here for
[34:44] a purpose.
[34:45] &gt;&gt; We're not here for a good time, just a,
[34:47] you know, fellowship. That's not it.
[34:50] &gt;&gt; We're here on a mission.
[34:52] &gt;&gt; Fulfill this mission.
[34:53] &gt;&gt; Fulfill this labor.
[34:56] &gt;&gt; Pray the Lord of the harvest that he'll
[34:58] have laborers.
[35:01] &gt;&gt; Into the fields.
[35:03] &gt;&gt; Amen. There a lot of people behind the
[35:05] scenes. It's not those just behind the
[35:07] pulpit, but the people behind the
[35:09] scenes.
[35:12] I want to give a special welcome to our
[35:14] sister Sylvia Nolton's Meyer sitting
[35:17] here between Gail and Sister Ruth
[35:19] Frederick. Sister Sylvia, would you just
[35:22] raise your hand so the people will know
[35:23] who it is now?
[35:36] You might be, she might be new to you,
[35:40] but you're not new to her.
[35:42] Sister Sylvia and her husband Carl Carl
[35:45] passed away last year.
[35:48] And uh they've been streaming the
[35:50] meetings here for about since 207,
[35:54] excuse me.
[35:56] And uh
[35:58] so she even knew where people were
[36:00] sitting.
[36:02] and she said, "I just want to be here in
[36:05] fellowship with the church." And so she
[36:08] has moved all the way from Georgia to be
[36:11] here.
[36:14] And brother Matt Desmet, Brother Terry
[36:17] Schmoutz. I want to give a special
[36:19] thanks to them.
[36:21] They went and hauled our sister Sylvia's
[36:25] stuff out here.
[36:27] and uh she doesn't know exactly where
[36:29] we're going to unload it yet, but
[36:33] that's fine. And we want you to make her
[36:35] feel welcome. I know that you have
[36:37] already. We don't want to smother her,
[36:40] but you know, make her feel welcome.
[36:45] We really uh appreciate the step of
[36:47] faith that she is uh
[36:51] without her husband has taken and it's
[36:54] it's it's been a massive thing. Our
[36:58] brother Terry was telling me I I thought
[37:00] that they had gone through three
[37:01] different trucks. He told me now it's
[37:04] five.
[37:06] Five trucks.
[37:09] Tie rod ends on one, the motor seized on
[37:12] the next one. And I don't know what
[37:13] happened on the others. Maybe Randy,
[37:17] it'll be over to you and your
[37:22] We say praise God.
[37:24] We always go back to the message brother
[37:26] Tom preached who said it's bad.
[37:30] &gt;&gt; I'll probably put a plug in here through
[37:33] brother Randy. He got us in touch with
[37:35] or got in touch with the the headman CEO
[37:39] of Budget International.
[37:42] And I think that I just said to some
[37:45] brothers, I said, "Well, how do how does
[37:46] he know him?" I said, "Brother Randy
[37:49] probably knows the Pope Secretary by her
[37:51] first name.
[37:55] I haven't found anybody that brother
[37:56] Randy doesn't know. So anyway, we got
[37:59] with the top man, told them the whole
[38:02] all the details and all the trouble
[38:04] we're having with the first two trucks.
[38:07] And uh he said, "When those men arrive
[38:10] in the West Coast to Bellingham, just
[38:12] have them list absolutely every cost,
[38:15] and this trip's not going to cost you
[38:17] anything.
[38:28] So, Sister Sylvia started out here with
[38:30] it costing quite a bit and ended up with
[38:32] it costing nothing. Just as long as
[38:35] you're allowed to have a little trouble
[38:36] along the line.
[38:38] So, God bless our sister Sylvia and
[38:41] brother Terry, sister Shannon, Linda
[38:44] flew out to fly back with her and Wesley
[38:48] and Amanda. They're about 90 miles from
[38:51] her place and they went up and and
[38:53] arranged other trucks and everything.
[38:55] It's it, you know, the body of Christ is
[38:57] a wonderful body.
[39:00] It's just a wonderful body. That's all
[39:02] we can say.
[39:06] Uh,
[39:07] next Sunday
[39:10] we're going to have just one service.
[39:11] That's Easter Sunday. It'll be 11:00 in
[39:14] the morning. The Saints are coming up
[39:16] from Seattle also, but we'll just have
[39:18] one service because of the traffic at
[39:21] the border. I was in Nexus yesterday and
[39:24] it still took about 50 minutes,
[39:27] which is unusual, but nevertheless,
[39:30] uh then we can have a relaxed time, have
[39:32] as long as we wish, and it's it's we're
[39:36] remembering
[39:38] Easter, Easter Sunday.
[39:41] All right.
[39:43] Thank you for standing. If you'll take
[39:45] your Bibles, I'll have you turn to
[39:47] Luke's Gospel
[39:51] the third chapter and we'll commence to
[39:54] read.
[39:56] I have two places to read and the second
[39:58] will be Romans 8.
[40:10] Get me
[40:28] Thanks.
[40:31] All right. Luke the 3 chapter. I'm going
[40:34] to read verses
[40:37] uh 1:3 and then 12- 15.
[40:43] Now in the 15th year of the reign of
[40:46] Tiberius Caesar, Pontis Pilate being
[40:50] governor of Judea and Herod being
[40:53] tetriarch of Galilee and his brother
[40:55] Philip tetriarch of Itia
[40:59] and of the region of uh Tricontis
[41:04] and Lassanius
[41:07] the tetriarch of Abelene.
[41:10] Anna, Annis the and Caiaphas being the
[41:14] high priests, the word of God came unto
[41:17] John the son of Zachcharias in the
[41:19] wilderness. Isn't it amazing? All these
[41:22] great fellows,
[41:25] high priests and all the rest of it. But
[41:27] the word of God comes to John in the
[41:29] wilderness.
[41:29] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[41:31] &gt;&gt; And he came unto all the country. And he
[41:34] came into all the country about Jordan,
[41:36] preaching the baptism of repentance for
[41:39] the remission of sins. Verse 12. Then
[41:42] came also publicans to be baptized, and
[41:46] said unto him, Master, what shall we do?
[41:50] Notice now publicans are coming. Master,
[41:52] what shall we do? And he said unto them,
[41:55] exact no more than that which is
[41:57] appointed you. And the soldiers likewise
[42:00] demanded of him, saying, "And what shall
[42:03] we do?" And he said unto them, "Do no do
[42:06] violence to no man, neither accuse any
[42:10] falsely, and be content with your
[42:12] wages." And as the people were in
[42:15] expectation,
[42:17] and all men mused in their hearts of
[42:20] John, whether he were the Christ or not.
[42:26] And then if you'll turn to Romans,
[42:30] I'll read
[42:32] 8 and verse 18.
[42:35] For I reckon that the sufferings of this
[42:37] present time are not worthy to be
[42:39] compared with the glory which shall be
[42:41] revealed in us. For the earnest
[42:44] expectation of the creature waiteth for
[42:47] the manifestation of the sons of God.
[42:50] For the creature was made subject to
[42:52] vanity, not willingly, but by reason of
[42:56] him who hath subjected the same in hope.
[42:59] Because the creature itself also shall
[43:02] be delivered from the bondage of
[43:04] corruption into the glorious liberty of
[43:07] the children of God.
[43:09] &gt;&gt; For we know that the whole creation
[43:11] groanth and travaleth in pain together
[43:14] until now. And not only they, but
[43:17] ourselves also,
[43:20] which have the first fruits of the
[43:22] spirit, even we ourselves grown within
[43:25] ourselves, waiting for the adoption to
[43:29] the redemption of our body.
[43:32] &gt;&gt; Amen. Let's just have prayer.
[43:35] Our loving father, we're so thankful we
[43:39] can say, "Our Father,
[43:42] &gt;&gt; which art in heaven,
[43:45] &gt;&gt; hallowed be thy name, thy kingdom come,
[43:48] thy will be done on earth as it is in
[43:51] heaven. We pray, oh God, you'll forgive
[43:53] us our sins, forgive us our debts as we
[43:56] forgive others who are indebted to us.
[43:59] We thank you for your provision. Thank
[44:01] you for the food you provided, but thank
[44:04] you for the spiritual food. Thank you
[44:07] for this message, oh God, and the gift
[44:09] of the Holy Spirit that has been given
[44:12] to fill us that we might understand the
[44:15] things that you have given to the
[44:17] children. Oh God, your children that
[44:20] you've called, the elect lady, thank you
[44:23] for this bride message, oh God. pray
[44:26] that you will inspire all who are
[44:28] gathered here and those that are
[44:30] streaming and those that will hear the
[44:32] service, Lord, what by whatever means.
[44:35] And I pray, Father, you'll bless those
[44:37] that labor in the word, oh God, and the
[44:40] hearers today, the speaker, Father, I
[44:43] surrender myself to you. May your will
[44:46] be done. May you be glorified. You're
[44:50] the only worthy one, oh God. Come and
[44:52] move amongst us, oh God, and get great
[44:55] glory to your name. All hail the name of
[44:58] Jesus Christ. How we want to glorify
[45:01] you, Lord. Thank you, Father. Anoint us
[45:04] now, Lord Jesus. In your name we ask it.
[45:06] Amen.
[45:08] &gt;&gt; Amen. You may be seated.
[45:15] There are two things that I would like
[45:17] to uh draw to your attention out of
[45:21] these scriptures which we read and it
[45:24] has to do with the expectation. I want
[45:26] to speak to you on something that's very
[45:30] pressing on my heart and it has to do
[45:33] with the expectation
[45:36] in the season of the rapture.
[45:39] Now the Bible tells us that of the
[45:42] ministry of John the Baptist and that
[45:45] was the spirit of Elijah that was sent
[45:48] to introduce
[45:50] Jesus Christ. I would please ask you to
[45:54] grasp what God was doing because you
[45:57] can't manufacture this. But what he did,
[46:01] he details in verses 1, 2, and three how
[46:04] that all of these various men and uh
[46:09] political celebrities we could say were
[46:12] in their regions of power and authority
[46:15] and so on. But then beside that, here's
[46:19] John in the wilderness and the word of
[46:21] God comes to John in the wilderness and
[46:24] he begins preaching and the publicans
[46:27] come to him, the military comes to him,
[46:31] the religious leaders come to him. The
[46:33] Bible even says one place are all
[46:35] gathered to him, all Judea, Samaria and
[46:37] so on. And there and and then the Bible
[46:40] says this and as the people as they were
[46:45] in expectation.
[46:46] Now the reason they were in expectation
[46:49] is because when when the certain word of
[46:54] certain promises of God when they come
[46:57] into the the time of their fulfillment
[47:00] there's a movement on the people even
[47:02] the people don't perhaps understand it
[47:05] but they they come into a state or an
[47:07] atmosphere of expectation
[47:10] they know that something should happen
[47:13] and like even the public today not just
[47:16] even Christians but the public you know
[47:18] they ask the question what's happening
[47:21] and something's happening they they're
[47:24] totally in the dark they're confused
[47:26] about it what is taking place it's not
[47:29] the same as it used to be uh something
[47:32] is is uh something is developing
[47:34] something's evolving and there's all
[47:36] kinds of uh philosophical uh ideas and
[47:39] thoughts about it and then the churches
[47:41] take it from different angles and so on
[47:43] but the Bible says and as The people
[47:47] were in expectation
[47:50] and all men, not a few, all men mused in
[47:56] their hearts. That is, they pondered.
[47:59] They meditated. They they they were
[48:02] filled with wonderment in their hearts
[48:05] uh regarding John whether he was the
[48:09] Christ or not. Now, they didn't have
[48:12] that wonderment about Elijah or Elisha
[48:15] or Moses or Samuel or any of the other
[48:19] prophets or Isaiah or Jeremiah or
[48:21] Daniel, they didn't have that. There
[48:24] wasn't the people weren't filled with
[48:25] wonderment uh whether he's the Christ or
[48:28] not. But when the spirit of Elijah comes
[48:31] in the season
[48:33] &gt;&gt; of the redeemer's coming,
[48:36] &gt;&gt; Christ's first coming, then the people
[48:39] they were there was an atmosphere that
[48:42] God had brought upon the people and they
[48:45] were they were filled with expectation.
[48:48] It like something's happening,
[48:50] something's got to happen.
[48:52] &gt;&gt; Something must be taking place that they
[48:54] they feel it coming upon them. They feel
[48:57] the pressure of the time, but they don't
[48:59] know what it is. And then and then when
[49:02] they see John coming with the spirit of
[49:04] Elijah preaching what he was preaching
[49:07] and demonstrating, and he didn't even
[49:10] demonstrate any miracles, you know, I I
[49:12] I even spoke to brother Brandon when we
[49:14] were together. I said it always was
[49:17] especially
[49:19] uh uh it was a wonderment to me that
[49:22] John the Baptist I mean I'm sorry Elijah
[49:25] came and he I understand from the
[49:28] scripture that he performed four
[49:30] miracles but he didn't really preach and
[49:33] Elisha came and performed asked for
[49:36] double portion he performed eight
[49:38] miracles and he didn't really preach so
[49:41] Elijah came the first coming second
[49:43] coming he He did miracles but didn't
[49:46] really preach. Then comes the spirit of
[49:49] Elijah on John the Baptist and he
[49:51] preached but didn't do any miracles. And
[49:54] then comes the Elijah ministry in our
[49:57] time preaching and doing miracles. It's
[50:01] a consummation of the whole thing. And
[50:03] it was a doing miracles first and then
[50:06] preaching and bringing a message. To me
[50:08] it was very remarkable. But when John
[50:11] began to preach, the Bible says, "And
[50:13] the people mused. They they wondered.
[50:17] They pondered. They they turned it
[50:19] around like it even means that they it
[50:22] they revolved. It revolved in their
[50:24] thoughts. Who is this? And what is this?
[50:28] And is this the Christ? Is he the
[50:30] Messiah or not?" It was so so near
[50:34] because he is the he's the one to
[50:37] introduce the Messiah. and they almost
[50:40] become inseparable.
[50:42] And then now now
[50:46] John
[50:48] John the Baptist came in the physical
[50:50] body and Jesus the Messiah was there.
[50:55] &gt;&gt; It's it's not surprising that they had
[50:57] that confusion in their mind because
[51:01] Jesus was already there. He just hadn't
[51:04] revealed himself yet and John was there
[51:06] to introduce him. And so that is why it
[51:09] was just like it was almost being
[51:12] homogenized together where John in one
[51:15] body, Jesus in one body, and he could
[51:18] say, "Behold the lamb of God that takes
[51:21] away the sin of the world." But in the
[51:23] end time, the forerunner is in a body,
[51:27] but the one he's introducing is not.
[51:30] &gt;&gt; He's in another realm. He's in the
[51:32] unseen. So he has to take the one that's
[51:35] in the scene and take him into the
[51:37] unseen back and forth and back and forth
[51:39] so he can say to the people, "He's
[51:41] here."
[51:42] &gt;&gt; As much as you are here, he's here. As
[51:45] much as the angels are here as much as
[51:48] television is here. As much as the
[51:50] airwaves are carrying voices, he's also
[51:53] here. He's more real than those things.
[51:56] More real than my voice going out to
[51:58] you.
[51:59] &gt;&gt; Do you believe that? If you can grasp
[52:01] that and hold that,
[52:04] &gt;&gt; then if we hear what the Elijah spirit,
[52:08] the prophet has to say, it will set up
[52:12] an expectation
[52:15] &gt;&gt; for what is to take place.
[52:17] &gt;&gt; And that's why we're here.
[52:21] &gt;&gt; Amen. So, the people were in expectation
[52:24] and they all mused in their hearts
[52:27] regarding John.
[52:30] So when the time of deliverance arrived
[52:32] for the children of Israel
[52:36] in they were in bondage. They were
[52:38] slaves
[52:40] in Egypt. But when the time and the
[52:43] season because the the scripture the
[52:46] promise to Abraham was that his seed
[52:48] would go into bondage but after 400
[52:52] years they would come out with a mighty
[52:54] hand. So now they're not aware. Those
[52:59] people perhaps aren't aware that that is
[53:01] what God spoke to their father Abraham
[53:05] 400 years ago. Generations of children
[53:08] have come and gone and now they're
[53:11] slaves, but they they were crying out to
[53:14] God. And God said, "I've heard their cry
[53:18] &gt;&gt; and I've come down
[53:20] &gt;&gt; to deliver them. Go thou, therefore,
[53:23] he's saying to Moses. Why? The season
[53:26] had come. But the thing was, because the
[53:30] word was coming into his season, a
[53:33] spirit of expectation was falling upon
[53:36] the people. Even though they couldn't
[53:38] identify exactly what that expectation
[53:40] was,
[53:41] &gt;&gt; they just knew that something was to
[53:43] take place. And they came into a spirit
[53:46] of expectation when Moses came on the
[53:48] scene and said, "Let my people go." I
[53:51] tell you what, those people said, "We've
[53:52] been waiting for that.
[53:55] &gt;&gt; We've been waiting for this."
[53:57] &gt;&gt; And it was so compelling that even even
[54:01] other people followed them and went with
[54:04] them.
[54:06] &gt;&gt; I don't know if any Jews stayed behind,
[54:08] but nevertheless, or of the Hebrews, I
[54:11] should say, but Moses arrived on the
[54:13] scene and the people were gathered to
[54:16] his message.
[54:19] Expectation
[54:22] is not only what we would refer to the
[54:26] word as I mean expectation
[54:28] but it is awaiting.
[54:33] It's looking
[54:35] for them who look for him.
[54:38] This isn't that I I'm all swallowed up
[54:40] with my daytoday things. I'm all
[54:43] swallowed up with my work. I'm all
[54:45] swallowed up with my business. I'm all
[54:47] swallowed up with my education. I'm all
[54:50] swallowed up with all of these. That's
[54:52] not it.
[54:53] &gt;&gt; It is a waiting,
[54:55] &gt;&gt; a looking. And these other things are
[54:58] just peripheral. They're on there side
[55:00] issues.
[55:01] &gt;&gt; I'm looking. I'm waiting. And for those
[55:04] that wait and look for him, shall he
[55:07] appear the second time to those that
[55:09] look for him?
[55:13] Amen.
[55:16] &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham was a hunter. A lot of
[55:19] brothers here have hunted. I can tell
[55:21] you one thing or fished.
[55:24] You get out in the woods
[55:28] and when I go hunting, I mean the moment
[55:31] moment I leave camp,
[55:35] everything's changed.
[55:38] He just I I I take a few steps
[55:42] and I just stop and look. And I love
[55:46] getting alone because I'll get up and if
[55:49] especially if the wind is blowing and I
[55:51] get the wind blowing against me and I I
[55:54] I'm not worried about the politics.
[55:57] I'm not worried about the financial
[55:59] things or any meltdown.
[56:02] &gt;&gt; I'm not worried about I don't think I
[56:04] just don't my mind isn't there. My mind
[56:07] is just here and I think I might see
[56:09] maybe I just see an ear of an animal
[56:12] behind a tree. I tell tell you what
[56:14] friends, you are focused.
[56:17] You are looking.
[56:19] You're not you're not you're not
[56:21] thinking about another thing. You're
[56:23] just thinking this is what you're here
[56:25] for. And and if that's that way just in
[56:27] the natural, how much more so? We ought
[56:30] to be just be taking a step at a time.
[56:33] And I'm just here. This is what I'm This
[56:35] is what I've been born for. I've been
[56:37] born here to look and to wait and to
[56:40] watch and to expect
[56:45] &gt;&gt; a resurrection.
[56:46] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[56:49] &gt;&gt; Let me say this.
[56:52] Somebody here is going to see it.
[56:58] &gt;&gt; I hope I'm one of them.
[57:02] &gt;&gt; Somebody's going to see it.
[57:05] Yes, sir.
[57:05] &gt;&gt; Who cares then
[57:08] &gt;&gt; where you what station you get to in
[57:10] life?
[57:11] &gt;&gt; Who cares about
[57:12] &gt;&gt; any fame or fortune or labors or or
[57:15] anything else? Who cares about that?
[57:19] &gt;&gt; If you should be granted the privilege
[57:22] as you have been granted the privilege
[57:24] to hear what you have already heard. And
[57:28] what I'm saying is today, this message
[57:31] by this Elijah came for a purpose. To
[57:34] put you into an atmosphere of
[57:37] expectation,
[57:39] &gt;&gt; to grip you,
[57:41] &gt;&gt; to move you, to capture you, to
[57:44] apprehend you,
[57:47] &gt;&gt; to select you,
[57:49] &gt;&gt; elected, chosen.
[57:51] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. the chosen of the Lord
[57:56] &gt;&gt; to catch and see and and to be
[57:59] participant in
[58:02] &gt;&gt; a resurrection
[58:04] &gt;&gt; called to have the change of your body.
[58:08] &gt;&gt; There's going to be a sweep. It's not
[58:10] going to sweep over all humanity. It's
[58:13] going to sweep over certain ones.
[58:17] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[58:18] Brother Brandham said the rising of the
[58:20] sun, when the sun shines, it shines on
[58:22] the rocks,
[58:24] &gt;&gt; but nothing happens. It shines on the
[58:27] dirt, but if there's no seed, nothing
[58:29] happens. It shines on the weeds.
[58:33] &gt;&gt; It shines on the thorns. It shines on
[58:35] all of it. But there is some that's been
[58:38] elected.
[58:39] &gt;&gt; The wheat is wheat.
[58:42] &gt;&gt; And that's what comes out of the seed is
[58:44] wheat.
[58:46] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[58:47] &gt;&gt; Amen. Yes, Lord.
[58:48] &gt;&gt; And there's something by way of seed, a
[58:51] predestinated seed, and it can only
[58:54] bring forth a predestinated life.
[58:59] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[59:01] &gt;&gt; And because of that,
[59:03] &gt;&gt; this message came to put you in
[59:05] expectation. Didn't come to give you
[59:06] another doctor, another religion,
[59:08] another church.
[59:09] &gt;&gt; It came to put you in expectation
[59:12] &gt;&gt; for what God had promised
[59:15] &gt;&gt; in that word.
[59:18] This isn't Moses message.
[59:22] &gt;&gt; This revealing message
[59:25] &gt;&gt; and this is very interesting word. It's
[59:27] the only time it's used
[59:30] like this in the Bible. The Bible does
[59:33] say that David he did muse.
[59:37] But then the people they mused whether
[59:39] this was the Christ or not, whether John
[59:43] was the Christ or not. And the the root
[59:46] word is very very interesting
[59:50] because in the Greek it is to uh to put
[59:54] together or to collect. Like when you
[59:57] have a log, the word log, we we log the
[1:00:02] the people on the on this boat or we log
[1:00:06] there's a log of the of the people who
[1:00:09] may be on a plane. And you look at the
[1:00:10] log and they've collected all the people
[1:00:14] that's on that plane and put it on this
[1:00:16] list. It comes from mused.
[1:00:20] And so I have to put it together for
[1:00:22] you. So the the root word is to put
[1:00:25] together or to collect
[1:00:27] when the people mused. It's to ponder,
[1:00:33] meditate, consider,
[1:00:36] to reason,
[1:00:38] and to put different reasons together to
[1:00:40] reckon up to reckon up the reasons why
[1:00:44] this is so. And it concludes that if you
[1:00:49] consider and ponder just in your in the
[1:00:52] in your bank account, if you consider,
[1:00:54] and this is one of the examples they
[1:00:55] give, they give. If you consider that
[1:00:58] and you evaluate and you collect things
[1:01:01] up, all your reasons for determining I
[1:01:05] have $25 left in my bank account.
[1:01:09] The word mused, it reduces it down.
[1:01:13] Says, if you have reasoned and collected
[1:01:16] all your thoughts together, I have $25
[1:01:19] in my bank account. The conclusion is
[1:01:22] you have $25 in your bank account.
[1:01:25] That's how powerful that word is. It it
[1:01:29] is actually to impute. You impute. And
[1:01:32] the scripture says that Abraham believed
[1:01:36] God
[1:01:38] &gt;&gt; and God imputed to him
[1:01:41] &gt;&gt; righteousness
[1:01:43] &gt;&gt; and he accepted that. He took the
[1:01:46] thoughts of God and he and and he
[1:01:48] gathered all the thoughts of God. And
[1:01:51] and God God imputed to him righteousness
[1:01:55] because he believed God.
[1:01:58] &gt;&gt; And all you have to do is say, "I
[1:01:59] believe God there. I believe God here. I
[1:02:02] believe God there." The promise says,
[1:02:04] "All have sinned and come short of the
[1:02:06] glory of God." I believe that. The Bible
[1:02:09] says, "Believe on the Lord Jesus Christ
[1:02:11] and thou shalt be saved." I believe
[1:02:13] that. The Bible says he died for our
[1:02:15] sins. I believe that when time you
[1:02:18] collect those together, you got eternal
[1:02:20] life
[1:02:23] because he said it. Not because you feel
[1:02:26] it. You may not feel any different. You
[1:02:28] may feel worse when you're done, but you
[1:02:30] believe the promise of God.
[1:02:33] You believe you have $25. You have.
[1:02:36] You've collected all the all the data,
[1:02:39] all the things. You've collected it into
[1:02:40] a log set. At the bottom, it says, "I
[1:02:43] have $25. I don't see the bank. I don't
[1:02:46] see the account, but I have $25 in the
[1:02:49] account." I say, "You may not feel
[1:02:51] eternal life. You may not see eternal
[1:02:53] life, but I've gathered all. I've logged
[1:02:56] it all together, and I have eternal
[1:02:58] life."
[1:02:59] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:03:01] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And when I collect Luke
[1:03:03] 17:30,
[1:03:05] when you see the days of Lot again, when
[1:03:07] they'll be building and so on and
[1:03:09] daring, are they building?
[1:03:12] &gt;&gt; When you see the days of Sodom again, do
[1:03:15] you see them?
[1:03:16] &gt;&gt; Okay, we're collecting it all together.
[1:03:18] Even so shall it be in the day when the
[1:03:21] Son of Man is revealed. Have you seen
[1:03:24] that?
[1:03:28] &gt;&gt; And you hear that? Do you hear the son
[1:03:30] of man speak through that messenger that
[1:03:33] even so this will be the forerunner?
[1:03:36] &gt;&gt; Do you believe that the angel of the
[1:03:38] lord appeared at the river Ohio?
[1:03:41] &gt;&gt; Do you believe that? He said as John the
[1:03:43] Baptist forerran the first coming so
[1:03:46] will your message for the second. You
[1:03:48] believe that?
[1:03:50] &gt;&gt; We're collecting it together. We're
[1:03:52] making a log of the promise. Hallelujah.
[1:03:57] And you believe what he said that the
[1:04:00] dead in Christ shall rise first. And
[1:04:02] then you believe that we who remain
[1:04:05] shall be caught up together with them.
[1:04:08] You believe you collected in the law and
[1:04:10] we shall be changed in a moment, in the
[1:04:13] twinkling of an eye. You believe it?
[1:04:17] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:04:20] Why do we believe it? Because we've
[1:04:22] mused,
[1:04:23] &gt;&gt; we've pondered,
[1:04:25] &gt;&gt; we've read it,
[1:04:27] &gt;&gt; we've ate it,
[1:04:28] &gt;&gt; we've thought about it, we've listened
[1:04:31] to it in our car, we listen to it in our
[1:04:34] bed, we read it, we come to church. This
[1:04:37] is why we're here. We're musing about
[1:04:40] it.
[1:04:43] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And we're saying, I believe
[1:04:46] that.
[1:04:50] Hallelujah.
[1:04:51] &gt;&gt; And when you've come to that point, the
[1:04:53] almighty God says, "I've imputed it to
[1:04:56] you."
[1:04:58] &gt;&gt; You believe you have 25, you have 25.
[1:05:01] You believe you have eternal life, you
[1:05:03] do have eternal life.
[1:05:07] &gt;&gt; And the prophet messenger says, "How
[1:05:09] long do you have it? As long as you
[1:05:11] believe it."
[1:05:13] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:05:15] &gt;&gt; How long are you healed? as long as you
[1:05:17] believe it.
[1:05:20] &gt;&gt; Glory to God.
[1:05:26] &gt;&gt; Isn't that wonderful?
[1:05:29] &gt;&gt; And when the people believed the
[1:05:31] vindicated messenger,
[1:05:33] &gt;&gt; then whatever God promised
[1:05:36] &gt;&gt; by that messenger for that season, when
[1:05:40] the people believed it,
[1:05:42] &gt;&gt; it was imputed to them.
[1:05:45] That's why I stress
[1:05:48] believing what he said.
[1:05:51] &gt;&gt; And God had said to Abram, "Know of
[1:05:54] assurityity. Know for certain."
[1:05:56] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:05:57] &gt;&gt; That your seed will be a stranger in a
[1:06:00] land that is not theirs,
[1:06:03] and shall serve them, and they shall
[1:06:04] afflict them 400 years.
[1:06:08] And also that nation whom they shall
[1:06:10] serve will I judge. and afterward shall
[1:06:13] they come out with great substance. So
[1:06:17] they knew that.
[1:06:19] I guess that's why they went and
[1:06:21] borrowed everything that they could
[1:06:25] when they left Egypt.
[1:06:28] And the Apostle Paul says, "I reckon
[1:06:31] that the sufferings of this present
[1:06:33] time, you have some, you have your
[1:06:37] share, you have your problems.
[1:06:41] We all do.
[1:06:44] &gt;&gt; I don't know anybody here that doesn't.
[1:06:47] We've got our concerns. We've got our
[1:06:49] burdens.
[1:06:53] And they're big.
[1:06:55] They can be very big.
[1:06:58] They can cause tears,
[1:07:01] pain,
[1:07:02] sorrow.
[1:07:07] That's why I wasn't here Wednesday
[1:07:08] night's service. I got word late late
[1:07:11] Tuesday night
[1:07:13] that a very dear friend of mine had
[1:07:15] passed away suddenly
[1:07:17] and we had a very short time to get to
[1:07:20] the service to be at the funeral
[1:07:24] and how brief time is
[1:07:27] how unpredictable it is.
[1:07:30] We all have our
[1:07:32] uh concerns and some of them perhaps go
[1:07:34] on
[1:07:36] for some time.
[1:07:38] But the sufferings of this present time
[1:07:40] are not worthy.
[1:07:43] &gt;&gt; Not worthy.
[1:07:45] &gt;&gt; You want to repeat that to yourself. My
[1:07:48] problems are not worthy
[1:07:50] &gt;&gt; to be compared with the glory which
[1:07:52] shall be revealed in me.
[1:07:55] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:07:56] &gt;&gt; For the earnest expectation, here it is.
[1:07:59] The earnest expectation of the creature.
[1:08:02] Hello creatures.
[1:08:04] &gt;&gt; Creatures of earnest expectation.
[1:08:06] The earnest expectation of the creature
[1:08:09] waitth for the manifestation of the sons
[1:08:11] of God. And brother Brandham says that
[1:08:13] manifestation of the sons of God could
[1:08:16] not come until the end time.
[1:08:18] &gt;&gt; Perhaps I'll come to it a little bit
[1:08:20] later on. The expectation, the act of
[1:08:22] looking, not only looking, but looking
[1:08:25] confidently.
[1:08:28] &gt;&gt; Amen. I know it's going to happen
[1:08:37] &gt;&gt; in the time of Moses. And I'm just going
[1:08:39] back and forth a little bit.
[1:08:41] We are told in the and God spoke through
[1:08:45] so many of the of his uh seers and sages
[1:08:49] and prophets and kings and David
[1:08:52] referred to it how he brought them out.
[1:08:54] It isn't that he brought them out of
[1:08:56] Egypt. He brought them out with a mighty
[1:08:58] hand.
[1:08:59] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. It wasn't some limp lame
[1:09:02] thing. With a mighty hand.
[1:09:05] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:09:09] &gt;&gt; If if God did that
[1:09:11] &gt;&gt; for Hebrews,
[1:09:13] &gt;&gt; many who would perish in the wilderness.
[1:09:16] &gt;&gt; Many who would perish, listen to me, in
[1:09:19] the wilderness. If he divided the Red
[1:09:22] Sea, if he allowed the people to go
[1:09:25] through on dry land, if he swallowed up
[1:09:27] the whole armies of the superpower of
[1:09:30] the earth at that time, what do you
[1:09:32] think he will do for the elect that are
[1:09:33] going to sit around the marriage table?
[1:09:36] &gt;&gt; What do you think he's going to do for
[1:09:37] the bride of Jesus Christ?
[1:09:40] &gt;&gt; Believe it, friends. There is nothing,
[1:09:43] nothing, there's no power that can
[1:09:46] separate you from the love of God.
[1:09:48] Believe it. Put it in your log.
[1:09:52] &gt;&gt; Add it to your series. Collect it.
[1:09:57] &gt;&gt; No one.
[1:09:59] &gt;&gt; There's nothing that can separate you
[1:10:01] from the love of God which is in Christ
[1:10:04] Jesus.
[1:10:05] &gt;&gt; To the elect.
[1:10:06] &gt;&gt; We can't believe that we're elect and
[1:10:08] somehow God is going to desert us.
[1:10:11] &gt;&gt; There is no such a thing. You're the
[1:10:13] apple of his eye. Amen.
[1:10:15] &gt;&gt; His eye is ever upon you with every
[1:10:17] move.
[1:10:19] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:10:20] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:10:24] &gt;&gt; And furthermore,
[1:10:27] this word, I wish I could pronounce it
[1:10:29] for you, but it starts out it's log,
[1:10:34] I z or zed, however you wish. O m ai.
[1:10:41] And it's permount logid zahi
[1:10:46] but it starts with the log and that is
[1:10:48] the important issue.
[1:10:52] It says of this Greek word it deals with
[1:10:57] reality.
[1:10:59] It's not dealing with
[1:11:01] you know uh something that is
[1:11:06] uh abstract.
[1:11:08] It deals with reality. Amen.
[1:11:12] &gt;&gt; And it is to count out and to weigh out
[1:11:16] and to meditate upon it, to take into an
[1:11:19] account and to make an account.
[1:11:22] &gt;&gt; I I feel I need to stay with that just
[1:11:24] for a few moments. You've got $25. You
[1:11:28] have it.
[1:11:29] &gt;&gt; You've logged that. You've calculated
[1:11:31] that. You've accounted that.
[1:11:36] &gt;&gt; It deals with reality.
[1:11:40] For what s the scripture, Abraham
[1:11:44] believed God? Why did he believe God?
[1:11:47] Well, God said this and God said that
[1:11:49] and God said whatever else to him and he
[1:11:51] believed it. He didn't do a, you know,
[1:11:54] selection and say, "Well, that sounds
[1:11:56] all right, but this one doesn't look
[1:11:57] very possible." That isn't the issue.
[1:12:01] &gt;&gt; He believed God. Whatever God said, he
[1:12:04] believed it.
[1:12:05] &gt;&gt; God said, "Leave your kindred." So, he
[1:12:07] did. leave your country. So he did. Go
[1:12:10] to a place that I'll show you. So he
[1:12:12] did. And he didn't know where he was
[1:12:14] going.
[1:12:15] &gt;&gt; That's a kind of belief.
[1:12:17] &gt;&gt; You're you're you're required to do the
[1:12:19] same thing. You don't know where this
[1:12:20] thing's going to end up.
[1:12:22] &gt;&gt; A lot of us can say, and I'm sure most
[1:12:24] of us have said at some point in time, I
[1:12:26] never dreamed that I would encounter
[1:12:28] this uh you know, in my walk with
[1:12:30] Christ,
[1:12:31] &gt;&gt; but we did.
[1:12:34] &gt;&gt; Did we stop? No, we didn't stop. We
[1:12:36] carried on. Why do we carry on? Cuz we
[1:12:38] can't do anything else.
[1:12:41] &gt;&gt; Because we put it in the log. That was
[1:12:43] God that spoke. And I believe it
[1:12:47] sir.
[1:12:47] &gt;&gt; It's God who said Malachi 4 would come
[1:12:50] and I believe it
[1:12:52] &gt;&gt; and I've heard it.
[1:12:53] &gt;&gt; How many others have heard the same
[1:12:55] thing you've heard and rejected it? But
[1:12:57] you heard it and you believed it. That's
[1:12:59] right.
[1:13:00] &gt;&gt; That is why you believed it because
[1:13:02] there's a seed in there that that deep
[1:13:04] believes it
[1:13:06] &gt;&gt; and was calling for it.
[1:13:10] &gt;&gt; I'm sure it'll be the it would be the
[1:13:12] testimony of many if not all here.
[1:13:18] &gt;&gt; Before you even heard the message,
[1:13:22] you experienced
[1:13:24] a crying, a calling out. Amen.
[1:13:27] &gt;&gt; I was calling out for something that was
[1:13:29] real.
[1:13:33] &gt;&gt; I've seen this and I saw that and I
[1:13:35] tried this and I tried that but it
[1:13:38] didn't satisfy.
[1:13:45] What say the scripture? Abraham believed
[1:13:47] God and it was counted unto him for
[1:13:50] righteousness.
[1:13:52] And Abraham accepted that he was
[1:13:54] righteous. It wasn't just that God
[1:13:57] accounted it to him, but he believed
[1:13:59] that account.
[1:14:01] &gt;&gt; And the Bible says also Romans 4 and 22,
[1:14:04] "And therefore it was imputed to him. It
[1:14:09] was accounted to him. It was put in his
[1:14:12] account. It was reckoned to him that he
[1:14:15] was righteous."
[1:14:17] Now, let me take you quickly.
[1:14:22] The angel said, "Come hither, and I will
[1:14:24] show you the lamb's wife."
[1:14:28] And it was granted to her that she would
[1:14:31] be er arrayed
[1:14:35] in fine linen.
[1:14:37] She was not just dressed, she was
[1:14:39] arrayed in fine linen.
[1:14:46] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:14:48] which is the righteousness of the
[1:14:50] saints.
[1:14:53] &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham said, and you can find
[1:14:54] it and you want to search it out. He
[1:14:58] said, "Let me dress that bride."
[1:15:03] &gt;&gt; Why could he say that? Because he knew
[1:15:06] that he was coming forth with a message
[1:15:08] and he knew, listen friends, there was a
[1:15:11] fraction. I just thought I would might
[1:15:13] do that this morning. How many people
[1:15:16] here never ever saw Brother Brandham in
[1:15:20] his lifetime?
[1:15:22] Raise your hands.
[1:15:26] How many here did see him? You could
[1:15:29] stand.
[1:15:37] I know. Sister did. Sister Andy's as
[1:15:40] well. No. One, two, three.
[1:15:43] were four. Five.
[1:15:49] Thank you. Five. Six.
[1:15:54] One over there with seven.
[1:15:56] There seven in this audience.
[1:15:59] Seven. What made the rest of you
[1:16:02] believe? Blessed are they
[1:16:05] &gt;&gt; that see not
[1:16:07] &gt;&gt; and believe. More blessed are they
[1:16:09] &gt;&gt; that see not and have believed.
[1:16:13] Put it in your log.
[1:16:15] &gt;&gt; I had something.
[1:16:17] &gt;&gt; I can't explain it. There's something
[1:16:20] down here that absolutely convinced me
[1:16:24] &gt;&gt; and caused me to surrender
[1:16:26] &gt;&gt; and caused me to uh to to sell out,
[1:16:31] &gt;&gt; to give up,
[1:16:32] &gt;&gt; to surrender.
[1:16:34] Some of you left
[1:16:36] &gt;&gt; homes
[1:16:38] &gt;&gt; and left families
[1:16:40] &gt;&gt; and you have you have given yourself
[1:16:43] completely to the word that you heard.
[1:16:46] What caused such a thing?
[1:16:47] &gt;&gt; That is God's grace, abundant grace to
[1:16:52] you.
[1:16:55] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:16:55] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:16:56] &gt;&gt; How wonderful it is. The people mused in
[1:17:00] their heart. The Bible says they mused
[1:17:04] in their heart about John. They didn't
[1:17:06] mu they didn't just muse in their heart.
[1:17:08] I love the way the scriptures. They
[1:17:09] didn't just muse in their heart, but
[1:17:11] they mused in their heart about this
[1:17:14] person.
[1:17:17] I want to say to this congregation,
[1:17:20] I can tell you one thing.
[1:17:24] The whole world, the whole religious
[1:17:26] world mused in their heart concerning
[1:17:30] William Brham.
[1:17:33] &gt;&gt; They had never seen anything like that.
[1:17:36] &gt;&gt; Right.
[1:17:37] &gt;&gt; And they could not produce it.
[1:17:39] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:17:39] &gt;&gt; And that's what gave him such
[1:17:41] confidence. Read or listen to Godhead
[1:17:45] explained. Right.
[1:17:47] &gt;&gt; And he has all those ministers there in
[1:17:48] Chicago, doctors and DDDs and, you know,
[1:17:53] all the all the degrees of of of the
[1:17:57] religious world.
[1:18:00] And he and he just takes them so simply
[1:18:02] through the scripture. And here's this
[1:18:04] man who they don't want to accept. They
[1:18:08] don't want to accept his idea of the
[1:18:10] Godhead. They don't want to accept the,
[1:18:12] can you believe it? Not accept the
[1:18:14] baptism.
[1:18:16] There was those who said, "We're going
[1:18:17] to be baptized." He said, "Not one
[1:18:20] showed up
[1:18:21] &gt;&gt; to be baptized." Can you imagine
[1:18:23] ministers preaching to thousands of
[1:18:25] people refusing to be baptized in the
[1:18:29] name of their lovely Lord Jesus Christ?
[1:18:32] &gt;&gt; Isn't this preposterous?
[1:18:35] &gt;&gt; Isn't this unbelievable? Amen.
[1:18:40] &gt;&gt; And he kindly told them, you know, if
[1:18:44] you can't
[1:18:46] take the scripture and come and stand
[1:18:49] here beside me
[1:18:51] and not one
[1:18:53] &gt;&gt; came and stood beside him. Oh, after he
[1:18:55] was gone, they had all kinds of things.
[1:18:57] Oh, yes. Great declarations and
[1:19:00] prophecies and everything else. And I
[1:19:02] you know what I say? Nonsense.
[1:19:04] &gt;&gt; Absolute nonsense. when he was here,
[1:19:07] they were so amused and they wondered
[1:19:10] and they tried to duplicate.
[1:19:12] &gt;&gt; That's what he that's what he says. I
[1:19:14] hope you're learning
[1:19:16] &gt;&gt; in the message. You know, he talks about
[1:19:18] impersonators.
[1:19:20] &gt;&gt; Now, he said he even named brethren and
[1:19:23] he said, "My dear brothers, they're my
[1:19:26] dear brothers." But he did not excuse or
[1:19:29] compromise on what they were doing. They
[1:19:32] were impersonating his ministry. Amen.
[1:19:36] &gt;&gt; Prayer lines. Where did prayer lines
[1:19:38] come from? Prayer lines. I mean, that
[1:19:40] was the reason why prayer lines came
[1:19:42] into existence is because brother Brand
[1:19:44] had to take them by the hand.
[1:19:47] &gt;&gt; And reveal the disease,
[1:19:49] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:19:50] &gt;&gt; And I I I stood right there. I was as
[1:19:52] close as some of you people there and
[1:19:54] watched it while he took he shook a
[1:19:58] deacon's hand out of my elers's hand out
[1:20:00] of out of my church and he just shook
[1:20:02] his hand across the restaurant table and
[1:20:04] he jerked and looked at me said did you
[1:20:06] get that
[1:20:07] get get that I tell you what it just
[1:20:12] I didn't have any capacity to get that
[1:20:14] but he was just shaking hands with the
[1:20:15] brother and he picked it up
[1:20:18] you know what it caused us to do it
[1:20:20] caused us to muse
[1:20:22] But I kept musing. I kept pondering. I
[1:20:25] could not get away. I kept collecting
[1:20:28] all the all the facts and the
[1:20:31] fulfillment of the scripture. And
[1:20:33] finally, when I begin to see Malachi 4
[1:20:36] and begin to see Luke 17:30 and
[1:20:39] beginning to see Jesus Christ the same
[1:20:41] yesterday, today, and forever, and see
[1:20:44] Revelation 10, and Revelation 3 and 14,
[1:20:48] the messenger to the church age, and 10
[1:20:51] and seven, and by the time I put it all
[1:20:55] in the account, I could say, I got a
[1:20:57] message.
[1:20:59] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:21:00] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. You know what? I got a
[1:21:03] revelation.
[1:21:04] &gt;&gt; And others could say, "You do? What is
[1:21:07] the revelation?" Oh my. It's so
[1:21:09] precious.
[1:21:10] &gt;&gt; Have you got a revelation?
[1:21:15] &gt;&gt; Might be mysterious to a lot of folks.
[1:21:18] &gt;&gt; It's more real
[1:21:20] &gt;&gt; than your physical body.
[1:21:23] &gt;&gt; You can pinch your hand if you wish, but
[1:21:25] I can tell you that my revelation is
[1:21:27] greater than even your body that you're
[1:21:28] sitting in. Hallelujah. Because the
[1:21:30] revelation's going to outlive this body.
[1:21:38] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:21:44] &gt;&gt; I just added this little note. The
[1:21:46] people should have listened to their
[1:21:47] heart
[1:21:49] &gt;&gt; in John the Baptist when they were
[1:21:50] musing. They should have listened to
[1:21:52] their heart and they'd been a lot better
[1:21:53] off
[1:21:54] &gt;&gt; if they'd listened to their heart. When
[1:21:57] your heart is saying yes,
[1:22:00] &gt;&gt; yes,
[1:22:01] &gt;&gt; yay,
[1:22:02] &gt;&gt; amen, listen to it. Don't listen to your
[1:22:05] head and say, well, this, that, the
[1:22:07] other thing. Listen to your heart.
[1:22:09] &gt;&gt; Your heart will lead you
[1:22:11] &gt;&gt; in a more correct
[1:22:14] &gt;&gt; place.
[1:22:17] Although Jesus had not even revealed
[1:22:19] himself completely at that time yet
[1:22:25] when he began to come and reveal himself
[1:22:27] to the people
[1:22:30] uh
[1:22:31] it was a separating time even then. Now
[1:22:35] I have I have some quote that I want to
[1:22:39] give you here.
[1:22:42] When the people believed the vindicated
[1:22:46] messenger,
[1:22:47] then whatever God promised for that
[1:22:51] season was imputed to them.
[1:22:56] &gt;&gt; This is a rapture message.
[1:23:00] &gt;&gt; That's what it's all about.
[1:23:03] &gt;&gt; This is about the ultimate victory that
[1:23:05] was purchased at Calvary. That's what
[1:23:08] this whole message is about. This is
[1:23:10] about the forerunner coming and
[1:23:13] introducing a people to Jesus Christ.
[1:23:17] Jesus Christ is not here physically. We
[1:23:20] don't need that because we're looking as
[1:23:21] Apostle Paul said to the unseen.
[1:23:24] &gt;&gt; Are you looking to the unseen? Not some
[1:23:27] figment of your imagination, a reality.
[1:23:31] &gt;&gt; Listen friends, if you want to if you
[1:23:33] want to understand me better, go home
[1:23:35] and listen to listen to some of the
[1:23:38] prayer lines. not to take you back 40,
[1:23:41] 50 years. Listen to some of the prayer
[1:23:43] lines. And when when you see this man,
[1:23:47] when you hear him
[1:23:50] telling the people the just intricate
[1:23:53] details of their life, I want you to
[1:23:56] commence musing.
[1:23:57] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:23:58] &gt;&gt; And say to yourself,
[1:24:00] who is that?
[1:24:03] &gt;&gt; It's not William Brennham,
[1:24:05] &gt;&gt; seventh grade educated Kuckian. Not him.
[1:24:10] He never saw these people. They're
[1:24:11] saying, "You've never seen me before.
[1:24:14] Are we strangers? They're strangers."
[1:24:17] Muse about it. Think about it. Ponder
[1:24:20] it. Who is that? You say, "Well, you
[1:24:23] say, "Well, that's simple, Brother Ed.
[1:24:25] It's it's none other than Jesus Christ.
[1:24:28] Where is that Jesus Christ, then?" Well,
[1:24:30] he he's right there. He wouldn't even do
[1:24:33] that. He wouldn't even start that until
[1:24:36] he was at the platform. All right. So
[1:24:38] now we have a messenger who God is
[1:24:41] speaking through his mouth. And now we
[1:24:44] take our musing further. What is the
[1:24:46] purpose?
[1:24:47] &gt;&gt; What is he saying? What's he doing this
[1:24:49] for? Why is he talking to people who
[1:24:52] will not even receive Jesus Christ? What
[1:24:55] is the whole purpose? What is this? So
[1:24:57] he says it's the sign. It's a sign. The
[1:25:00] sign is pointing somewhere. It's a sign
[1:25:03] of the resurrection. Oh, this is
[1:25:06] actually pointing to the resurrection.
[1:25:12] &gt;&gt; Where is it pointing?
[1:25:15] &gt;&gt; To the resurrection.
[1:25:16] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:25:18] &gt;&gt; This is a sign taking us to the
[1:25:21] resurrection. If I just keep following
[1:25:23] the signal,
[1:25:27] &gt;&gt; we ought to end up to the destination.
[1:25:32] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen.
[1:25:34] &gt;&gt; These aren't idle words when I say
[1:25:36] &gt;&gt; there are those here
[1:25:39] &gt;&gt; and I hope it rings something true in
[1:25:41] you
[1:25:43] &gt;&gt; that shall see the resurrection.
[1:25:45] &gt;&gt; That's according to this message because
[1:25:47] it's a sign of the resurrection. What
[1:25:49] are you young men and young ladies going
[1:25:51] to do? I'm sure you're going to see it.
[1:25:55] &gt;&gt; I'm expecting to see it.
[1:25:59] Hallelujah.
[1:26:00] &gt;&gt; How much expectation do you have? Every
[1:26:02] &gt;&gt; day.
[1:26:03] &gt;&gt; Every day, my friends. Every
[1:26:05] &gt;&gt; day.
[1:26:07] &gt;&gt; I look for it every day.
[1:26:10] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:26:12] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:26:14] &gt;&gt; Absolutely.
[1:26:17] &gt;&gt; And he said unto Abraham, "Know assurely
[1:26:19] that thy seed shall be a stranger in a
[1:26:22] land that is not theirs, and shall serve
[1:26:23] them, and they shall afflict them 400
[1:26:26] years. And also that nation whom they
[1:26:28] shall serve will I judge and afterward
[1:26:30] they shall come out with great
[1:26:32] substance. They shall come out with
[1:26:34] great substance. That is what fell upon
[1:26:37] the people and expectation that they
[1:26:40] shall come out. 400 years of slavery.
[1:26:44] &gt;&gt; But something came into them. We shall
[1:26:47] not stay here.
[1:26:50] Amen.
[1:26:51] &gt;&gt; Something has to come upon the people of
[1:26:54] this message that says, "We're not
[1:26:56] staying here."
[1:26:59] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[1:27:00] &gt;&gt; I'm not a resident of Satan's Eden.
[1:27:04] &gt;&gt; Amen. That's
[1:27:06] &gt;&gt; right.
[1:27:06] &gt;&gt; It's not just a song. I'm bound for the
[1:27:09] promised land. I am indeed on my way to
[1:27:13] the promised land.
[1:27:20] in the message. Is this a sign of the
[1:27:22] answer? And you know when that was it
[1:27:25] was just before and this was foretelling
[1:27:28] of the coming of the of the angelic
[1:27:31] messengers and the opening of the seals.
[1:27:34] He said that angel coming and said, this
[1:27:38] was on the Ohio River before many, many
[1:27:42] people as John was sent to wind up the
[1:27:45] Old Testament and to bring forth the
[1:27:47] introduction of Christ. Your message
[1:27:50] will wind up the loose ends and I will
[1:27:54] introduce the Messiah just before and
[1:27:56] will introduce the Messiah just before
[1:27:58] his coming. the message of the last
[1:28:01] days. Notice the mighty angel swore with
[1:28:05] an oath that time would be no more. Now
[1:28:07] we're in Revelation 10. And just think
[1:28:10] of this a minute now. In other words,
[1:28:13] muse about this for a few moments,
[1:28:15] friends.
[1:28:18] &gt;&gt; In the in the messages of the last few
[1:28:20] weeks, there's been one thing that's
[1:28:23] been pronounced to me, and I want you to
[1:28:25] muse about this.
[1:28:27] people. I know that people have
[1:28:29] wondered, you know, where did that come
[1:28:30] from? Because I have become conscious.
[1:28:34] I'm grabbing a loose end that's over
[1:28:36] here and a loose end that's over here
[1:28:37] and one that's up there and one that's
[1:28:40] back maybe some years ago. And by the
[1:28:43] time you pull those loose ends together,
[1:28:45] you've got a composite picture.
[1:28:47] &gt;&gt; And the composite picture, you know,
[1:28:50] like blows me away.
[1:28:51] &gt;&gt; Amen. But it's because he it's
[1:28:53] prophesied that this message came to
[1:28:56] bring the loose ends together.
[1:28:59] &gt;&gt; And there's a lot of loose ends out
[1:29:00] there, folks.
[1:29:02] &gt;&gt; I'm not down on the denominational
[1:29:04] people. They're doing the best they can
[1:29:05] with loose ends.
[1:29:07] &gt;&gt; But until you accept and put into your
[1:29:10] log right here at the top, I got Malachi
[1:29:13] 4. I have Elijah the prophet. I believe
[1:29:16] in the spirit. And that because of that,
[1:29:19] I have a message. And in this message is
[1:29:22] a bunch of loose ends that's been put
[1:29:23] all together again. Are you with me?
[1:29:30] &gt;&gt; This angel
[1:29:32] come down from heaven.
[1:29:34] &gt;&gt; So the other seven angels of the seven
[1:29:37] church ages were earthly messengers. But
[1:29:41] this angel,
[1:29:42] &gt;&gt; all of the message is finished. The
[1:29:44] seventh angel winds up the whole thing.
[1:29:47] And this angel comes not to the earth.
[1:29:50] He isn't a man from the earth as the as
[1:29:54] the messengers to the church ages.
[1:29:56] That's finished. But this angel brings
[1:29:59] the next announcement. And an angel
[1:30:02] means a messenger. And he comes down
[1:30:05] from heaven clothed in that pillar of
[1:30:08] light cloud with a rainbow over his
[1:30:11] head. And a rainbow is a covenant. It
[1:30:14] was Christ with one foot on the land and
[1:30:17] one foot on the sea. And he swore that
[1:30:20] time shall be no more.
[1:30:23] &gt;&gt; Where are we at, sir?
[1:30:27] &gt;&gt; Where are we at?
[1:30:29] &gt;&gt; Now, he said before a lot of this was
[1:30:32] fulfilled. He's asking it. This is even
[1:30:34] before the experience
[1:30:36] &gt;&gt; of the cloud formation of the angels
[1:30:38] coming. Where are we at? He's asking,
[1:30:41] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:30:42] &gt;&gt; Yes. What's all this about?
[1:30:45] &gt;&gt; He said, I'm asking you.
[1:30:48] &gt;&gt; I say that puts us into great
[1:30:51] expectation.
[1:30:53] &gt;&gt; The other angels were messengers, men of
[1:30:56] the earth. But this angel, this said to
[1:30:59] the angel of the church of Leodya, to
[1:31:01] the angel of the church of Ephesus,
[1:31:04] messengers of the earth, men,
[1:31:07] &gt;&gt; messengers, prophets, and so forth to
[1:31:09] the church. But this one
[1:31:12] didn't come from the earth.
[1:31:14] &gt;&gt; He came down from heaven
[1:31:17] &gt;&gt; because the mystery is all finished. He
[1:31:19] came down from heaven because the
[1:31:21] mystery is all finished.
[1:31:24] &gt;&gt; Hello, folks.
[1:31:26] &gt;&gt; Whether you received it or not, the
[1:31:28] mystery is all finished.
[1:31:32] &gt;&gt; That's why I urge you hear the messages.
[1:31:36] And I would urge you to hear them in a
[1:31:38] in an order and hear especially those uh
[1:31:42] messages of significance with doctrine
[1:31:44] and meat in it. Christ is the mystery
[1:31:47] God revealed and the third exodus and
[1:31:49] and the token and these and the seals.
[1:31:52] You listen to them in an order and
[1:31:54] you'll you'll the loose ends.
[1:31:56] &gt;&gt; He'll make it known to you as you have
[1:31:58] need of and it will do one thing for
[1:32:00] you. It will put you into an atmosphere
[1:32:03] of expectation.
[1:32:09] I was talking to somebody here just the
[1:32:10] other day and they said they were in a
[1:32:12] message and they know that they've been
[1:32:14] in it maybe dozens of times. They said
[1:32:18] it was as though they had never read it
[1:32:20] before.
[1:32:21] &gt;&gt; I can say amen to that.
[1:32:25] &gt;&gt; This one didn't come from the earth.
[1:32:28] &gt;&gt; He came down from heaven
[1:32:30] &gt;&gt; because the mystery is all finished. And
[1:32:33] when the mysteries finished, the angel
[1:32:34] said, "Time shall be no more." The seven
[1:32:38] thunders throat out their voices out
[1:32:41] &gt;&gt; because the thunder is the voice of God
[1:32:44] speaking it out. Not just here to these
[1:32:47] ears,
[1:32:48] &gt;&gt; not just what's on a tape, but what what
[1:32:50] God speaks and vibrates within your own
[1:32:54] soul. And you know the amazing thing is
[1:32:57] last week I believe it was had about
[1:32:58] eight or nine brothers up here and they
[1:33:00] all quoted exactly the same scripture
[1:33:03] from all their different languages.
[1:33:05] &gt;&gt; The mystery the amazing thing is that
[1:33:08] when the revelation of that scripture
[1:33:10] repent and be ye baptized uh repent and
[1:33:14] be ye baptized in the name of Jesus
[1:33:15] Christ for the remission of your sins
[1:33:17] and you shall be and you shall receive
[1:33:19] the gift of the Holy Ghost. They all
[1:33:21] read the same thing in languages most of
[1:33:23] us didn't even understand or comprehend.
[1:33:26] But every one of those men got the same
[1:33:28] experience from hearing different
[1:33:31] audible sounds in their ears.
[1:33:35] &gt;&gt; I want to say to uh Tim and those that
[1:33:38] helped Elena and so on formatting the
[1:33:40] messages and sending it out, perhaps
[1:33:43] already
[1:33:45] one has realized their name is written
[1:33:49] in the book. Amen.
[1:33:51] &gt;&gt; And those that labor and those that pray
[1:33:53] and those that give shall share in this
[1:33:57] great commission. Friends, I'm consumed
[1:33:59] with it.
[1:34:00] &gt;&gt; I want to get the last one in.
[1:34:04] &gt;&gt; And that's what will give us a good
[1:34:06] time. Yes.
[1:34:14] &gt;&gt; Perhaps when you're listening
[1:34:17] and you hear this messenger say while
[1:34:20] he's talking and he calls the people and
[1:34:23] they gather
[1:34:25] and sometimes it's so laborious and he
[1:34:27] calls him by number and A1 and A2 and A3
[1:34:32] and A4 and call it's it's it's it seems
[1:34:35] like it's time consuming and it's so
[1:34:37] laborious. God did it so simple. And he
[1:34:41] stand and you'll hear him say sometimes,
[1:34:46] you know why I'm waiting.
[1:34:48] &gt;&gt; I'm just your brother.
[1:34:50] &gt;&gt; I'm helpless unless he comes.
[1:34:53] &gt;&gt; Then you'll hear him say, "He's here.
[1:34:57] &gt;&gt; If you could, if you were waiting in the
[1:34:59] audience and could actually see it,
[1:35:00] you'd see his hand go up like this."
[1:35:03] Said, "He's here.
[1:35:05] bring the first patient.
[1:35:08] &gt;&gt; Who's he talking about?
[1:35:10] &gt;&gt; He's talking about this angel that this
[1:35:11] messenger came down from heaven
[1:35:17] &gt;&gt; and he's there
[1:35:20] to give absolute
[1:35:23] infallible
[1:35:25] &gt;&gt; infallible
[1:35:27] &gt;&gt; proof
[1:35:28] &gt;&gt; of that ministry.
[1:35:31] He's going to give a vindication that
[1:35:34] nobody here, nobody streaming, and no
[1:35:36] one who ever heard it can dispute it.
[1:35:41] &gt;&gt; Doesn't that raise our expectation?
[1:35:45] &gt;&gt; I have something.
[1:35:48] &gt;&gt; This isn't something that had to uh uh,
[1:35:51] you know, improve with time.
[1:35:53] &gt;&gt; It was perfect the first time.
[1:35:56] &gt;&gt; God never had to change his mind or
[1:35:58] improve it. It was perfect the first
[1:36:00] time.
[1:36:02] &gt;&gt; Listen friends, children.
[1:36:04] You've got a message that's been
[1:36:07] vindicated by an infallibility
[1:36:10] &gt;&gt; by a messenger from another. He came
[1:36:13] down from heaven.
[1:36:17] &gt;&gt; He He ordained that he wouldn't be seen
[1:36:20] by your natural eyes because he's in
[1:36:23] another realm
[1:36:25] &gt;&gt; and he has a messenger. Just think only
[1:36:27] one. only one. Over six billion people,
[1:36:31] but only one.
[1:36:35] &gt;&gt; Moses was only one.
[1:36:38] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:36:39] &gt;&gt; And he said Moses was only one, but he
[1:36:42] declaring one other that was unseen.
[1:36:46] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:36:48] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:36:49] &gt;&gt; Friends, I have reason
[1:36:51] to be enthused.
[1:36:53] &gt;&gt; I have reason to preach with such zeal.
[1:36:57] I have reason because we're preaching
[1:36:59] something that the rest of the world
[1:37:01] knows very little about.
[1:37:06] &gt;&gt; I'm not preaching to to give you some
[1:37:09] quotes and just to, you know, make us
[1:37:11] feel uh a different We're not here to be
[1:37:14] different. We're here for a rapture.
[1:37:17] &gt;&gt; We're here for a change.
[1:37:20] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. Amen.
[1:37:24] &gt;&gt; And when the angel said, and you read it
[1:37:25] in Revelation 10 times, there'll be no
[1:37:28] more. What he's simply saying, if you
[1:37:30] read it in your in your uh column, it'll
[1:37:34] say that the the delay,
[1:37:36] &gt;&gt; the delay will be no longer. He won't
[1:37:39] delay the revelation any longer.
[1:37:44] He said, 'What if it's something to let
[1:37:45] us know how to enter into rapturing
[1:37:51] faith?
[1:37:52] &gt;&gt; This is in December of 62, February 63.
[1:37:56] The angels of the Lord come
[1:37:59] &gt;&gt; from the eternities and God is having
[1:38:01] him even he's preaching things and
[1:38:03] saying, "Is this it? Is this the time,
[1:38:05] sir?"
[1:38:06] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:38:10] And how and and and what if it's
[1:38:12] something to let us know how to enter
[1:38:14] into rapturing faith
[1:38:18] &gt;&gt; is it
[1:38:20] &gt;&gt; will we run and leap over walls?
[1:38:22] &gt;&gt; Is there something fixing to happen
[1:38:25] &gt;&gt; and these old marred vile bodies are
[1:38:28] going to be changed?
[1:38:30] &gt;&gt; Can I live to see it? Oh Lord, is it so
[1:38:32] close that I'll see it? See you. You can
[1:38:35] pick up his his own anticipation
[1:38:40] &gt;&gt; with all of this coming.
[1:38:41] &gt;&gt; Is this it? Is this the time? Sir,
[1:38:44] &gt;&gt; can I live to say it?
[1:38:52] &gt;&gt; Sir,
[1:38:54] my brethren,
[1:38:56] what time is it?
[1:38:58] &gt;&gt; Where are we at?
[1:39:00] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. I will say to you this
[1:39:02] morning without any apology
[1:39:05] after reading these and expounding on
[1:39:07] them just a little bit, don't don't
[1:39:10] don't you miss it.
[1:39:13] &gt;&gt; You have no reason to miss it.
[1:39:19] &gt;&gt; He said, "Let's look at the watch, the
[1:39:21] calendar to see what date we're living
[1:39:23] in. Israel's in Palestine." Okay, we'll
[1:39:26] put that in the log. in her homeland.
[1:39:29] The end sign, the sixth star of David.
[1:39:32] Uh uh 2,000 years have gone by. We put
[1:39:35] all this into our log. Nearly 2500 years
[1:39:38] go by. The oldest flag is flying.
[1:39:40] Israel's back in our homeland. When the
[1:39:42] fig tree put forth its buds, this
[1:39:44] generation shall not die. Shall not pass
[1:39:47] out, pass away until all things are
[1:39:49] fulfilled. We can put that into our log.
[1:39:53] &gt;&gt; You as students know what that's all
[1:39:54] about. Put it in your log.
[1:39:57] Put it in your computer if you want. I
[1:39:58] don't care where you put it.
[1:40:00] &gt;&gt; But muse on muse on it.
[1:40:04] &gt;&gt; Many mused. It didn't do many good.
[1:40:06] Let's not muse idally. Let's muse and be
[1:40:09] and and muse so long and so ponder it so
[1:40:13] deeply that God imputes it to us.
[1:40:20] &gt;&gt; That's the reason she's bearing birth
[1:40:22] painans because there's a fight in her.
[1:40:25] There's an Esau, just a man of the
[1:40:27] world, very religious and he's all
[1:40:29] right, good fellow, clean, moral, as far
[1:40:31] as I know of, but he don't know nothing
[1:40:34] about the birthright. He's born that
[1:40:37] way. Listen, friends, we can't be
[1:40:39] affected and afflicted by those others
[1:40:42] that perhaps don't have any call. You
[1:40:44] talk to people, maybe people who even
[1:40:46] come and fellowship in church or
[1:40:48] fellowship around the message, but they
[1:40:50] don't have any call.
[1:40:52] &gt;&gt; They just don't feel any pull. And I say
[1:40:55] to you, if you're here today and you
[1:40:56] say, "Well, I don't really feel like you
[1:40:58] do, brother Biscll. I don't feel such an
[1:41:01] energy and such a pull." Let me say
[1:41:03] this. Respect. You have respect for the
[1:41:06] God that called you.
[1:41:08] &gt;&gt; Have respect for the channel. Maybe
[1:41:10] mother, father, or some friend or maybe
[1:41:12] a minister that brought it to you. Have
[1:41:15] respect for it.
[1:41:16] &gt;&gt; And if you will respect it and say it, I
[1:41:18] know this is you.
[1:41:20] &gt;&gt; I know this is you. I know that this is
[1:41:23] supernatural. I know that this is God. I
[1:41:26] don't feel any particular energy about
[1:41:28] it, but I I believe that this is Malachi
[1:41:30] 4. I believe that this is the spirit of
[1:41:32] Elijah. I believe that that could not
[1:41:34] come from a man. And start to put it in
[1:41:36] your log
[1:41:37] &gt;&gt; and say, "Oh, Holy Spirit,
[1:41:40] &gt;&gt; come and quicken this to me."
[1:41:47] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:41:50] You'll never shake it.
[1:41:54] &gt;&gt; You'll never shake it.
[1:42:03] &gt;&gt; He's born that way. He's shaped that
[1:42:05] way. And Jacob,
[1:42:07] &gt;&gt; I don't care what he is.
[1:42:09] &gt;&gt; He wants that birthright. He's a
[1:42:11] spiritual one. You might be here and
[1:42:13] Satan has has beat you on the head and
[1:42:16] and and said you're not worthy of it and
[1:42:19] you're weak and you're a failure and
[1:42:20] you're this and all the rest of it. In
[1:42:22] spite of all of those things you want to
[1:42:24] be able to say and declare in your
[1:42:26] heart. One thing I do know those
[1:42:28] promises are yay and amen. In spite of
[1:42:31] my frailties, in spite of my failures, I
[1:42:34] believe that because I want that
[1:42:36] birthright.
[1:42:38] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:42:39] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:42:41] He's the spiritual one and them too
[1:42:44] today is in the womb of the church.
[1:42:47] There's a great big system trying to be
[1:42:50] formed called the world council of
[1:42:52] churches and from the womb of the church
[1:42:54] is coming forth two children. You just
[1:42:57] mark my word the world. He said word
[1:43:00] must deliver the word bride church. The
[1:43:04] church has got to be delivered out of
[1:43:07] her a bride for Christ. Do you realize
[1:43:10] that when he was saying that she had not
[1:43:12] actually been delivered?
[1:43:14] &gt;&gt; The bride of Jesus Christ has come out
[1:43:17] of the womb.
[1:43:19] &gt;&gt; I tell you what, it's been a birth pain.
[1:43:25] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:43:26] &gt;&gt; Okay, let me ask another question. How
[1:43:29] many here were in another faith or
[1:43:31] another church or another religion or
[1:43:33] another denomination or another belief
[1:43:37] before you came to the message? You were
[1:43:39] in one. You were committed to it. Let me
[1:43:41] see you raise your hands.
[1:43:45] All right.
[1:43:46] And I think of those that raised their
[1:43:49] hands, no one really
[1:43:52] was one of those who said, "I was
[1:43:53] physically here and saw the messenger."
[1:43:56] But you were in something else.
[1:43:59] You were in something else. And
[1:44:02] according to this, this is how literal I
[1:44:04] take this. You had to be delivered out.
[1:44:07] Amen.
[1:44:08] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:44:09] &gt;&gt; You had to be delivered.
[1:44:12] &gt;&gt; There was no way, brother Joe, for you
[1:44:13] and the family and brother Sam and
[1:44:15] brother Henry and brother Eli. No way
[1:44:18] for you to remain where you were. There
[1:44:20] was no way that I could remain in the
[1:44:22] fellowship. I did not belong to a
[1:44:23] denomination. Never have believed it was
[1:44:26] wrong. Believed denomination was
[1:44:28] something that was designed by the
[1:44:30] devil. That's what we actually believed.
[1:44:33] It was some system. And of course, I
[1:44:35] didn't know that we were as right as we
[1:44:37] were, but that didn't make the message
[1:44:38] right to me. When the message came,
[1:44:41] everything else had to fall in line with
[1:44:43] that.
[1:44:45] &gt;&gt; I had to be delivered.
[1:44:48] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:44:50] &gt;&gt; You had to be delivered.
[1:44:51] &gt;&gt; And those of you that were just in sin,
[1:44:53] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:44:54] &gt;&gt; you had to be delivered.
[1:44:58] &gt;&gt; You had to come out.
[1:45:02] &gt;&gt; You believe it. Yes.
[1:45:04] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:45:08] &gt;&gt; And them that fell asleep in all ages
[1:45:10] will make up that bride that come out on
[1:45:13] the word
[1:45:14] &gt;&gt; that they come out on. They in other
[1:45:17] words, they believe the word of their
[1:45:19] time like like from your feet coming to
[1:45:22] your head. She just gets greater
[1:45:25] &gt;&gt; and more you have to have and so forth.
[1:45:28] As the body grows up, so does the body
[1:45:30] of Christ grow up. And then finally,
[1:45:33] finally, finally, the head will come to
[1:45:37] it. The head of it all. The head of it
[1:45:40] all happens to be the mighty angel that
[1:45:43] he was just talking about. He will come.
[1:45:45] He's not from the earth. He comes from
[1:45:47] heaven.
[1:45:48] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:45:49] &gt;&gt; He was born of a virgin so he could go
[1:45:51] to Calvary in a body. And the body
[1:45:54] perished, died at Calvary, sacrificed
[1:45:58] for you, but the spirit that was in
[1:46:00] Christ raised him from the dead.
[1:46:03] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:46:07] &gt;&gt; I hope I'm not just preaching for my own
[1:46:08] good here, but I'm I'm feeling very
[1:46:11] energized about it.
[1:46:12] &gt;&gt; As the body grows up, he says, "And then
[1:46:14] finally the head will come to it."
[1:46:18] &gt;&gt; And I saw another mighty angel come from
[1:46:20] heaven. It's just different language of
[1:46:22] the same event. I saw another mighty
[1:46:24] angel come down from heaven. He said,
[1:46:26] "Who was it?" It was Christ.
[1:46:28] &gt;&gt; Who is Christ? He's the head of the
[1:46:30] body. Why is he coming down? Because the
[1:46:33] body is on earth.
[1:46:38] &gt;&gt; It's not a pair of feet that's on earth.
[1:46:41] &gt;&gt; It's not just a, you know, a part of the
[1:46:43] limbs on earth. The body's on earth.
[1:46:48] The body had been it had been shaped up.
[1:46:51] How did the body came? The same way the
[1:46:53] body of Jesus Christ came into the womb.
[1:46:56] All of this was done that it might be
[1:46:59] fulfilled which was spoken by the
[1:47:02] prophets.
[1:47:04] &gt;&gt; Remember last Sunday and God took the
[1:47:07] earth, the earth that had been formed up
[1:47:09] into the bodies of men and they were
[1:47:11] dying then
[1:47:13] &gt;&gt; because they were brought up out of a
[1:47:14] cursed earth. Their mother ate wheat and
[1:47:17] cabbage and bread and whatever more and
[1:47:19] fed the baby in the womb and the womb
[1:47:21] and out of the womb came prophets.
[1:47:23] Isaiah came out. Jeremiah came out.
[1:47:26] Elijah came out. Elisha came out. They
[1:47:28] all came out. But they spoke of the
[1:47:31] redeemer.
[1:47:33] &gt;&gt; They spoke of his sufferings.
[1:47:35] &gt;&gt; David the psalmist spoke of his
[1:47:37] sufferings. What is it? God's voice
[1:47:40] coming out of the earth.
[1:47:42] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:47:43] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:47:45] speaking their own redemption.
[1:47:50] &gt;&gt; And you in bodies of this earth, God has
[1:47:53] sent a message to you. And out of this
[1:47:56] cursed earth speaks salvation.
[1:48:00] You speak of your redemption.
[1:48:03] &gt;&gt; And God imputes it to you. It's
[1:48:05] righteousness.
[1:48:07] &gt;&gt; You confess,
[1:48:09] I'm redeemed.
[1:48:12] &gt;&gt; I'm redeemed.
[1:48:14] I said this morning in prayer, I believe
[1:48:17] &gt;&gt; that Jesus Christ
[1:48:19] &gt;&gt; died at Calvary for my sin.
[1:48:23] &gt;&gt; I believe he hung there.
[1:48:25] &gt;&gt; And when you believe that, all of your
[1:48:28] sin was nailed to that tree.
[1:48:33] &gt;&gt; Why wouldn't any man or woman want that?
[1:48:36] &gt;&gt; All of my sin,
[1:48:38] &gt;&gt; all of my sin
[1:48:40] &gt;&gt; is nailed to that tree.
[1:48:44] Hallelujah.
[1:48:47] &gt;&gt; Satan's head was crushed.
[1:48:50] &gt;&gt; And you want to say that to yourself,
[1:48:52] that enemy is on your trail.
[1:48:55] &gt;&gt; The hounds of hell will be on your
[1:48:57] trail. Even when you leave this church,
[1:49:00] you want to be able to say, "Satan, your
[1:49:03] head was crushed.
[1:49:05] &gt;&gt; And I'm celebrating.
[1:49:07] I'm celebrating this Easter. Your head
[1:49:10] was crushed. And I believe it. It's in
[1:49:13] my log.
[1:49:16] I am muse about that. I muse about that.
[1:49:20] I think about that. I ponder it. I
[1:49:22] believe it.
[1:49:24] &gt;&gt; And God says, "My son, my daughter,
[1:49:28] &gt;&gt; indeed,
[1:49:29] &gt;&gt; you have it.
[1:49:31] &gt;&gt; You have it.
[1:49:33] &gt;&gt; You have a life that's free
[1:49:35] &gt;&gt; of Satan's power.
[1:49:38] Amen.
[1:49:40] &gt;&gt; I'm talking about real things. He's
[1:49:42] greater than the sickness you may feel
[1:49:44] this morning.
[1:49:46] &gt;&gt; If you're sick and afflicted, the one
[1:49:48] I'm speaking of paid for it at Calvary.
[1:49:51] And he's greater than your sickness
[1:49:54] &gt;&gt; or your infirmity.
[1:50:00] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:50:02] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:50:03] &gt;&gt; And then finally, the head will come.
[1:50:08] This day is the scripture fulfilled.
[1:50:10] &gt;&gt; The world is in birth pains now. It was
[1:50:13] back then when he spoke it in ' 65. It's
[1:50:16] in birth pains now. The old has to be
[1:50:19] done away with so the new can be born.
[1:50:22] Just like a seed has to rot away in
[1:50:25] order to give new life. And under every
[1:50:28] prophet's message, Israel got a birth
[1:50:31] pain because that these prophets would
[1:50:35] come on the scene after the theologians
[1:50:38] and clergymen would have the church all
[1:50:41] in an organizational form. And when them
[1:50:44] prophets come on the scene with thus
[1:50:47] saith the Lord, they shook them
[1:50:49] churches. And she had a birth pain. And
[1:50:52] finally she gave she finally she had
[1:50:54] birth pains plum up to until she
[1:50:57] delivered a son of the gospel which was
[1:51:00] the word itself made flesh.
[1:51:05] &gt;&gt; I hope you grasp what he's saying.
[1:51:09] &gt;&gt; It wasn't only the word made flesh back
[1:51:11] then but the gospel of Jesus Christ. The
[1:51:15] word in this hour has become flesh in
[1:51:18] the bride of Jesus Christ.
[1:51:23] Hallelujah.
[1:51:24] &gt;&gt; And you know what gives me confidence in
[1:51:26] saying that? You know what gives me such
[1:51:28] assurance
[1:51:30] is that he
[1:51:32] a man, a brother in Christ.
[1:51:36] &gt;&gt; Who I call my precious brother Brandham
[1:51:38] as an individual that I can say in our
[1:51:41] time and you can say in my time. I heard
[1:51:44] about it this morning. You young people
[1:51:48] absorb this. Ponder this.
[1:51:52] Don't ponder some equation now or some
[1:51:55] something in your mathematics.
[1:51:58] Ponder this that in my time God sent
[1:52:03] this kind of a ministry with an
[1:52:06] infallible proof.
[1:52:08] &gt;&gt; And I've asked myself I am mused. I said
[1:52:10] why?
[1:52:12] &gt;&gt; Oh the answer came because he's a
[1:52:15] forerunner.
[1:52:17] &gt;&gt; I am mused further. Why? What was he
[1:52:20] forerunning? Who was he forerunning? He
[1:52:23] was forerunning the Messiah, the Christ,
[1:52:26] the son of God, the bridegroom, my
[1:52:30] husband. I put it all in the log. He was
[1:52:32] forunning him
[1:52:35] &gt;&gt; and further put it in the log. He said
[1:52:38] he would introduce the bridegroom to the
[1:52:41] bride
[1:52:42] &gt;&gt; as as the messenger, the servant
[1:52:45] introduced Boaz. Boaz said, "Who is this
[1:52:48] woman in the field?" Who's the field?
[1:52:51] Jesus said, "The field's the world." Can
[1:52:54] you imagine this savior Boaz coming and
[1:52:58] the prophet of God speaking to multitude
[1:53:00] of people and you weren't even here yet.
[1:53:04] &gt;&gt; But he said, "There's a bride.
[1:53:06] &gt;&gt; There is a bride."
[1:53:08] &gt;&gt; And the word that was coming out of his
[1:53:10] body would call that bride.
[1:53:12] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:53:16] Yes, sir.
[1:53:18] &gt;&gt; It called you.
[1:53:19] &gt;&gt; Put it in your log. Say, "Why did he
[1:53:22] call me?" Because you are to be the
[1:53:25] recipient, the beneficiary of what's in
[1:53:28] the promise.
[1:53:31] &gt;&gt; And he said, "This is the forerunner to
[1:53:34] the resurrection.
[1:53:35] &gt;&gt; This is the forerunning to the rapture.
[1:53:40] &gt;&gt; All you need to say is, "Here I am,
[1:53:42] Lord.
[1:53:43] Bring it on.
[1:53:45] &gt;&gt; Bring it on.
[1:53:47] &gt;&gt; We are here.
[1:53:48] &gt;&gt; We are ready. We're prepared.
[1:53:52] &gt;&gt; Can you say, "I believe."
[1:53:56] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:53:58] &gt;&gt; I believe the good report.
[1:54:00] &gt;&gt; Glory. Glory to the Lamb.
[1:54:03] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:54:05] &gt;&gt; You don't have to feel it. You just say
[1:54:07] you believe it.
[1:54:12] Hallelujah.
[1:54:13] &gt;&gt; Don't look at the impossibilities.
[1:54:15] &gt;&gt; That's right,
[1:54:16] &gt;&gt; Sister Violet. We all have them. I have
[1:54:19] them.
[1:54:20] &gt;&gt; Brother Gary,
[1:54:22] Brother Roy, Sister Judy, we all have
[1:54:26] them.
[1:54:27] &gt;&gt; We all have them. You say, "Well, I
[1:54:29] shouldn't name them." Well, he he names
[1:54:31] you.
[1:54:32] &gt;&gt; He knows your name.
[1:54:34] &gt;&gt; He calls your name. They're
[1:54:35] impossibilities.
[1:54:37] Brother Vile, Sister Mara, they think
[1:54:40] they're impossibilities. We will leave
[1:54:42] the impossibilities behind.
[1:54:44] Let me ask you, what would they mean if
[1:54:47] the sweet came before the service was
[1:54:49] over and you were transformed and
[1:54:52] changed and walking in another body?
[1:54:57] What would it mean? What would your
[1:54:59] studies, what would your future mean if
[1:55:01] it changed?
[1:55:07] nothing.
[1:55:12] &gt;&gt; The man on whose casket I just laid my
[1:55:14] hand
[1:55:16] and I spoke a few words concerning him.
[1:55:20] He was worth tens of millions, if not
[1:55:23] hundreds of millions of dollars.
[1:55:26] What does it mean to him?
[1:55:30] &gt;&gt; What it mean to him?
[1:55:33] I got called on the weekend said his
[1:55:36] kidneys are shutting down. They gave him
[1:55:38] a shot and he just went downhill and was
[1:55:41] gone Tuesday.
[1:55:44] Could have bought.
[1:55:47] In fact, is this man bought the
[1:55:49] Baptist's ho hospital in Amarella,
[1:55:53] Texas. And I was trying to find out if
[1:55:56] that happened to be the hospital brother
[1:55:58] Brandham was in. I hadn't found out yet.
[1:56:01] He bought the entire hospital
[1:56:04] in Amarella, Texas, the Baptist
[1:56:05] hospital. Huge complex
[1:56:09] going to turn it into a senior citizens
[1:56:11] home. What does that mean for him?
[1:56:14] &gt;&gt; Nothing.
[1:56:16] Nothing.
[1:56:18] &gt;&gt; What are those big problems that Satan
[1:56:20] tries to loom up in your make them like
[1:56:23] mountains in front of you? They're
[1:56:24] nothing. Amen.
[1:56:28] &gt;&gt; You're children of the sweep.
[1:56:31] &gt;&gt; You're children of the change.
[1:56:35] &gt;&gt; You have received the sign of the
[1:56:38] resurrection. That's why you're here.
[1:56:40] You've been following that sign.
[1:56:46] &gt;&gt; I tell you what, this is spiritual GPS.
[1:56:54] I'm so amazed with this GPS,
[1:56:57] &gt;&gt; you know, I can't quite get on to it. I
[1:57:00] They said, "Well, just push this button.
[1:57:01] Put this disc in here." Mine's never
[1:57:03] worked. I tell you what, if I ever
[1:57:05] followed GPS,
[1:57:07] I'd be y Calamazoo someplace.
[1:57:11] But I just so amazed. I was riding
[1:57:14] somebody riding with the taxi driver and
[1:57:17] he said, "Where are you going?" He says,
[1:57:18] "This is we're going to forest lawn."
[1:57:23] Okay.
[1:57:25] Keep left.
[1:57:27] Keep left. I thought my that woman seems
[1:57:30] that this fellow doesn't even hear it,
[1:57:34] but she just kept saying it. That's why
[1:57:36] we keep saying it.
[1:57:38] &gt;&gt; Keep right.
[1:57:39] &gt;&gt; Keep right.
[1:57:41] &gt;&gt; Keep right.
[1:57:42] Keep believing. That thing say left,
[1:57:45] left, turn left. At the next exit, turn
[1:57:49] left. Now turn right quickly.
[1:57:52] &gt;&gt; I thought it was amazing. She's actually
[1:57:54] telling us where we're going.
[1:57:56] &gt;&gt; If GPS can do that, I'll tell you what,
[1:58:00] there's a prophet in the land that knows
[1:58:02] where you're going.
[1:58:04] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:58:05] &gt;&gt; We got spiritual GPS.
[1:58:09] &gt;&gt; Turn the corner here. Hallelujah.
[1:58:13] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:58:16] &gt;&gt; I believed in the trinity at one time
[1:58:19] and I I believed there was father, son,
[1:58:21] holy ghost. I couldn't I couldn't put
[1:58:23] them together. Yeah, there one, but
[1:58:24] there's three. But I I don't know
[1:58:26] anyway. It's a mystery.
[1:58:28] But then I heard the prophet's voice and
[1:58:31] and the GPS says, "Turn right."
[1:58:34] &gt;&gt; We're at a corner. Turn right. He's one.
[1:58:37] &gt;&gt; Then he just explained it. Three offices
[1:58:39] in one go. said my that simple
[1:58:42] &gt;&gt; that is so simple
[1:58:44] and it be baptized in the name of the
[1:58:46] Lord Jesus Christ that's the only way
[1:58:48] they were baptized I want to be baptized
[1:58:52] my wife she couldn't you know get she's
[1:58:56] very precise
[1:58:59] and one day she decided
[1:59:02] I am going to read the scripture
[1:59:05] and I'm going to read every place that
[1:59:07] they were baptized and I am going to
[1:59:10] find out how they were baptized.
[1:59:13] And then she comes to me and she said,
[1:59:15] "Everyone, everyone is baptized in the
[1:59:18] name of the Lord, the name of the Lord
[1:59:19] Jesus, the name of the Lord Jesus
[1:59:20] Christ." I said, "Of course."
[1:59:24] Well, then then she couldn't wait to be
[1:59:26] baptized.
[1:59:27] &gt;&gt; So, we got baptized.
[1:59:29] &gt;&gt; What about we turn the corner?
[1:59:34] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:59:37] And then we're all going to come to the
[1:59:40] one we've been waiting for.
[1:59:42] &gt;&gt; This is the exit.
[1:59:45] &gt;&gt; This is the exit.
[1:59:48] &gt;&gt; Don't you want to hear that? This is the
[1:59:50] exit. Turn here. We're going to say
[1:59:53] goodbye world.
[1:59:57] &gt;&gt; We're going to sing this old world can
[1:59:59] never hold me. Any moment I'll be gone.
[2:00:07] You don't even have to be happy. You can
[2:00:08] just say, "I believe it."
[2:00:11] &gt;&gt; I believe it. Put it in your log.
[2:00:14] &gt;&gt; You think I'm just preaching a little
[2:00:16] sermon? No. I want you to put it in your
[2:00:18] log
[2:00:19] &gt;&gt; until she was delivered
[2:00:21] &gt;&gt; of a word of the gospel.
[2:00:27] &gt;&gt; That's fine.
[2:00:30] Hallelujah.
[2:00:32] I want to I want to sing a song
[2:00:36] musician.
[2:00:40] &gt;&gt; This old world
[2:00:43] &gt;&gt; can never hold me.
[2:00:45] &gt;&gt; Any moment I'll be gone.
[2:00:48] &gt;&gt; Oh my goodness. I can think of so many
[2:00:50] songs that don't know which one to sing
[2:00:52] first.
[2:00:54] &gt;&gt; I want to sing about
[2:00:59] No wonder. No wonder, brother Brenam
[2:01:02] singing, I just I just feel like
[2:01:04] traveling on. I feel like traveling on.
[2:01:07] My heavenly home is bright and fair. I
[2:01:10] feel like traveling on.
[2:01:11] &gt;&gt; Thank you for your kind attention and
[2:01:15] allowing me to express what's on my own
[2:01:18] heart. Oh, glory to God. It's such a
[2:01:21] reality. It's so real.
[2:01:24] &gt;&gt; Amen. Uh this old world, let's think to
[2:01:28] start with. This old world can never
[2:01:29] hold me. Any moment I'll be gone.
[2:01:36] Can never hold me
[2:01:39] anymore.
[2:01:42] Then I'll be gone.
[2:01:45] All right.
[2:01:47] Heat.
[2:01:58] Oh,
[2:02:11] my concentration
[2:02:14] and I have my
[2:02:19] Oh, I feel like traveling on. I feel
[2:02:21] like traveling on. My heavenly homely
[2:02:24] home is bright and fair. I feel like
[2:02:29] heavenly
[2:02:36] there. Heat. Heat.
[2:02:47] Yeah.
[2:02:54] I feel like
[2:02:58] it's clear.
[2:03:02] Heat. Heat. Heat.
[2:03:12] Heat. Heat.
[2:03:22] Heat. Heat. Heat.
[2:03:32] Heat. Heat. Heat.
[2:03:43] away.
[2:03:45] I feel like traveling.
[2:03:48] Oh, I feel like traveling.
[2:03:53] I feel like
[2:04:00] therefore
[2:04:04] we sing this last verse. The Lord has
[2:04:08] been so good to me. I don't mind saying
[2:04:11] things that perhaps it makes us
[2:04:14] vulnerable
[2:04:16] but I want you to know that you know the
[2:04:18] men who stand behind the pulpit and the
[2:04:20] men who preach the gospel of this
[2:04:22] message. I hear brother Brandham and
[2:04:25] sometimes it becomes so personal
[2:04:27] about his own life. It's almost an
[2:04:30] embarrassing embarrassment to hear him.
[2:04:33] He he he you know he said how he'd
[2:04:36] failed and he was down to the front.
[2:04:39] I was in prayer this morning
[2:04:42] and the greatness when I think of the
[2:04:45] greatness and the goodness and the
[2:04:50] how how the brother Brandham said
[2:04:54] that God could not in Christ the mystery
[2:04:56] of God revealed he couldn't make himself
[2:04:57] known he had to come down in the form of
[2:05:01] Jesus Christ otherwise we couldn't
[2:05:02] understand him he said it'd be too
[2:05:03] mystical it'd be too mysterious is what
[2:05:06] he said
[2:05:08] and I'm thinking of that the greatness
[2:05:10] of God. I'm thinking about the the
[2:05:12] galaxies in the of the entire creation.
[2:05:18] And I'm sure you would feel the same.
[2:05:21] You feel so small. You feel so
[2:05:23] insignificant.
[2:05:25] You feel as though you failed.
[2:05:28] And I just hung my head down on my Bible
[2:05:30] and I I said, "Lord,
[2:05:33] yeah, I feel like such a failure."
[2:05:36] I and then I was just reading which I
[2:05:38] perhaps if the Lord allows me next
[2:05:40] Sunday
[2:05:43] I read the entire part beyond the
[2:05:47] curtain of time
[2:05:54] and he said only perfect love
[2:05:57] &gt;&gt; could enter there
[2:06:00] &gt;&gt; only perfect love
[2:06:02] &gt;&gt; could enter there
[2:06:05] &gt;&gt; and it's Not not it's not what the world
[2:06:08] has told you or you read about in
[2:06:09] newspapers or the magazines or whatever.
[2:06:11] The world knows nothing about this love.
[2:06:14] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:06:15] &gt;&gt; Only perfect love can enter there.
[2:06:17] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:06:19] &gt;&gt; And I I feel short on that.
[2:06:22] &gt;&gt; I'm sorry but I feel short on that. I
[2:06:25] say, God, I failed you.
[2:06:28] I've just failed in obtaining this
[2:06:32] perfect love.
[2:06:33] It's so deep. It's so beyond me. It's
[2:06:36] beyond my grasp. It has hung my head on
[2:06:38] a Bible. And I want you to know that I
[2:06:41] come to the pulpit with that on my heart
[2:06:43] today. I said, God, you know, you you
[2:06:47] just have to speak your word. You have
[2:06:48] to just say it to the people. But as for
[2:06:51] me, I know one thing. This is what I
[2:06:54] believe.
[2:06:56] &gt;&gt; I believe it. I'll say it to the world.
[2:06:58] I'll say it to the devils. I say it to
[2:07:00] anybody. My friends, this is what I
[2:07:02] believe. This word is what we believe.
[2:07:05] &gt;&gt; And in spite of any weakness or frailty,
[2:07:08] that's why I could say that with such
[2:07:10] such vigor, such faith.
[2:07:13] &gt;&gt; I don't care how much a person fails.
[2:07:15] I'm not saying it about you. I'm saying
[2:07:16] it about myself. It's it's irrelevant.
[2:07:21] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. It's irrelevant.
[2:07:24] &gt;&gt; It's not how you fail. It's what do you
[2:07:25] believe.
[2:07:28] &gt;&gt; I declare I believe this word.
[2:07:31] &gt;&gt; I believe this message. Just think of
[2:07:33] it, friends. I wasn't saying it to you.
[2:07:35] I'm saying it for myself. Vindicated
[2:07:38] with infallibility.
[2:07:41] &gt;&gt; Where are you going to find that?
[2:07:43] &gt;&gt; In the encyclopedia? Never.
[2:07:46] &gt;&gt; In another church, in a denomination?
[2:07:49] Never. You won't find it. And who did he
[2:07:51] do it for? And I begin to put that into
[2:07:54] my log.
[2:07:56] &gt;&gt; And when you say, "He did it for me."
[2:07:58] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:07:58] &gt;&gt; He did that for me. Great.
[2:08:01] &gt;&gt; You say it to yourself. He did it for
[2:08:03] me.
[2:08:04] &gt;&gt; I'm putting it in my log.
[2:08:07] &gt;&gt; I'm going to ponder about this.
[2:08:10] Then you'll realize this last verse. The
[2:08:14] Lord has been so good to me. I feel like
[2:08:20] traveling on.
[2:08:26] Oh, I see. Heat. Heat. Heat.
[2:08:44] I feel like traveling on.
[2:08:49] The Lord has been so good to me. I feel
[2:08:54] like traveling on.
[2:09:02] Heat. Heat. Heat.
[2:09:22] Let me hear the young people 25 and
[2:09:24] under. I feel like
[2:09:40] all the young people once more.
[2:09:44] &gt;&gt; Let's hear it now.
[2:09:48] Sing it to the whole world.
[2:09:56] Wonderful. Everybody 25 and over.
[2:10:02] I feel like
[2:10:05] and
[2:10:09] I
[2:10:11] feel like everybody wants
[2:10:22] and
[2:10:28] I'm traveling on.
[2:10:33] &gt;&gt; Praise God. Praise God.
[2:10:38] Heavenly Father,
[2:10:43] our Lord Jesus said that I go to prepare
[2:10:46] a place for you.
[2:10:49] Your messenger said it was being
[2:10:51] prepared then.
[2:10:52] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:10:56] He said it was a special place designed
[2:10:59] for the bride of Jesus Christ.
[2:11:03] And we'll see them from every tribe and
[2:11:07] every tongue
[2:11:09] and the nations,
[2:11:11] our neighbors,
[2:11:13] our friends, our loved ones, our family.
[2:11:18] We want to be gathered to that table, oh
[2:11:20] God. and not only to the table, but then
[2:11:24] everything that takes place from then
[2:11:26] on.
[2:11:28] Prepare us, Lord. You know what needs to
[2:11:30] be,
[2:11:32] what we have need of, and what needs to
[2:11:33] be done. I wonder if while I'm praying,
[2:11:36] you may want to raise your hands and
[2:11:37] say, "Brother Ed, include me in this
[2:11:39] prayer, please."
[2:11:41] &gt;&gt; Oh God.
[2:11:44] Oh God, I have my hands up. Prepare me.
[2:11:48] &gt;&gt; Prepare us for this blessed place.
[2:11:51] prepare us for this place of perfect
[2:11:53] love.
[2:11:55] Prepare us, oh God. Oh God, I pray that
[2:11:59] you will infuse us with the very nature
[2:12:02] and character of Jesus Christ. That we
[2:12:06] we may respond and we may speak as you
[2:12:09] would speak and we may be silent as you
[2:12:11] would be silent and we may express you.
[2:12:15] Lord Jesus, what a privilege, what an
[2:12:17] honor it is for us. Bless this audience
[2:12:21] of people, oh God, and those that are
[2:12:23] streaming, those rooms that we have been
[2:12:26] privileged to enter into and fellowship
[2:12:28] with the saints in whatever country or
[2:12:30] place they are. Bless them. Bless them,
[2:12:32] I pray, oh God, until we meet. Until we
[2:12:35] meet at this blessed table of the Lord,
[2:12:40] Jesus, keep us, keep us in the hollow of
[2:12:43] your hand. Keep us in the sweetness of
[2:12:45] your Holy Spirit. I pray in Jesus name I
[2:12:48] ask it.
[2:12:50] Amen.
[2:12:51] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:12:53] &gt;&gt; I just want to sing while we're shaking
[2:12:55] hands some once before we shake hands.
[2:12:58] Oh love of God, how rich, how pure, how
[2:13:03] measureless and strong and strong and
[2:13:05] strong.
[2:13:08] Oh love,
[2:13:13] how great.
[2:13:19] How me
[2:13:25] and
[2:13:29] it shall forever
[2:13:36] in you
[2:13:40] this.
[2:13:47] Let's greet one another. Greet one
[2:13:49] another as we sing, oh lamb of God.
[2:13:55] My brother Derek
[2:14:30] from God.
[2:14:34] How rich and pure,
[2:14:38] how measureless
[2:14:44] and strong
[2:14:48] it shall forever
[2:14:53] more endure.
[2:14:58] the saints and angels
[2:15:03] shall
[2:15:06] God bless you. I trust you'll be able to
[2:15:10] take this atmosphere with you
[2:15:13] and we'll see you this evening. Brother
[2:15:16] John is going to be speaking and have
[2:15:18] the Lord's supper after he's done
[2:15:21] ministering as part of the service.
[2:15:22] You're dismissed in Jesus name. God
[2:15:25] bless you. Heat. Heat.
[2:15:59] Heat. Heat.
[2:16:27] Heat. Heat.
[2:16:56] Hallelujah.
[2:17:04] Heat. Heat.
[2:17:27] Oh,
[2:17:41] heat.
[2:18:11] Heat. Heat.
[2:18:17] Heat. Heat.
[2:18:41] Glory
[2:19:09] to you.
[2:19:21] Good.
[2:19:30] Good.
[2:19:35] Heat. Heat.
