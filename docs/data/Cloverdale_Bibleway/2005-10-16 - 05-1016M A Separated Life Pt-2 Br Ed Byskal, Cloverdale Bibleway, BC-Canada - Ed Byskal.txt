I'm going to ask Brother Derek Paris, Brother Derek, if you'd come and open the service in a word of prayer. [Music] There's there's some things this morning people have on their hearts that they want the Lord to give ear to and uh some testimonies of thanks. Sister Lorie Snow wants to thank the saints for praying for her mom during her surgery. Although the surgery was unsuccessful, they were able to place her on medicine uh to help her and uh want to continue to pray strength for her and also she wants to thank everyone for praying for her brother Richard. Remember we prayed for him. God is doing miracles in his life. He recognizes it is the Lord. Just continue to pray for his salvation as well as his healing. Brother Chris has uh requested prayer that the Lord would open the eyes of four people. Paul, Jerry, Sundance, and Star. Brother Mark Lowry is requesting prayer uh for Sister Deborah who's at home suffering from some sort of a skin allergy. It's very miserable for her and we just are believing for complete healing. I'd like you to remember in prayer a lady that I work with, name is Moren Chant, was in the hospital, had a real serious operation. Uh want to pray that God would just have his hand upon her. Uh, Sister Sandy Clemens is uh requesting prayer. Uh, her mom Filina Dross is very sick and wants us to remember her in prayer. And also Dave is requesting prayer for Bonnie. Amen. How many have a need this morning? They want to remember. Amen. And uh those who are listening in on the internet or on the phone, if you've got a need, you just lift it before the Lord as we go to prayer. Amen. Let's bow our hearts and our heads. Put a prayer together bearing these needs up before our Lord. Heavenly Father, we come Lord this morning unworthy in ourselves, Father, to stand in this August presence that we feel this morning. But Father, it's not by our own works. It's not by our own desires that we are here. But it is because you have called us, Father. Before the foundation of the world, you looked down through the eons of time and you said, "I will choose a little bride. I will call her out unto myself." And we stand here this morning, Lord, the redeemed of the lamb, the bloodbought this morning. Father, we give you praise, Lord Jesus. We give you all the honor. We give you the glory this morning. Lord, we see the troubles in the world, but Father, we know that these things must come to pass as well. But we know this morning, Lord, that you are going to come this morning and speak through our pastor. Lord, as your presence is already here, anointing the people to receive your word into a prepared ground, Father, prepare our pastor, Lord, &gt;&gt; give him the words to speak, Lord. And as he would stand behind this sacred desk, Father, would you take over, Lord Jesus, and would you give utterance, Lord? Lord, not to just tickle our minds or to give us a sensation in our flesh, Lord, but to transform us, oh God. Lord, to turn our mortal bodies into immortality, Father. Lord, we desire to reach out and touch you this morning, Lord. on behalf of these requests that have been pinned down before us. Lord, I lay my hands upon them, Father. Thinking of Brother Rod's request, think of Brother Mark Lowry's request. Sister Debbie, Lord, laying at home this morning. Father, we are more than overcomers in Christ Jesus. Lord, anything that we would ask, believing, Father, you said that it would be granted unto us. This morning we stand together as more than two or three people believing in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ that you would come on the scene on behalf of these requests that we have before us. Lord behind every uplifted hand that was raised in faith Lord. Lord in a simple faith where you said if we would have the faith the grain of a mustard seed. Lord a very small minute faith Lord that we could say to a tree be plucked up and planted into the ocean. Lord, a tree planted in the ocean we know in our carnal mind cannot bear fruit and live, but you said that that's what it would do. So, Father, if we could reach out in faith this morning, Father, believing that you would come on the scene once again. We know that you will do it. Father, have thine own way this morning, Lord. Lord, may you have control from the beginning to the end of this service, Lord. We don't know who is here in this congregation that has need of you, Lord. We don't know what needs lie behind the heart of your people. But Lord, each person that walked into this building had a particular desire. Lord, they didn't just come to see a man. They didn't just come to hear words spoken. But Lord, they've come with a desire to hear from you. I pray that in the simplicity of this meeting, in the foolishness of preaching, that lives would be saved. Lord, that bodies would be healed, the redeemed would be found. Lord, we bless your name. &gt;&gt; Be with you. musicians, the song leader, Lord, each and every vessel that has come in, may we empty out ourselves, Lord. May we just lay ourselves at your feet this morning, that we might learn of thee. We commit this day in its entirety into your perfect and divine care. In the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, we ask. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And you may be seated. We want to welcome everyone that's here this morning, those who are visiting us. We're really happy to have you here with us and trust that you're going to hear something from God this morning. That's the reason I'm here this morning. Amen. Trust you're here for the same reason. And uh we've got a couple of announcements and then our sister Elizabeth Neighbor is going to come bless us with a song. Um brother David and Sister Janna Waldner are happy to announce the birth of their son. Levi Timothy Waldner. He was born weddednesday the 12th of October. Weighed in at 8 lb 3 o. And uh mother and baby are doing fine. doesn't say anything about dad, but I'm sure he's doing okay, too. So, we're happy for brother David and Sister Jana. Amen. There is going to be a young people's meeting this Friday night, uh, October the 21st, 7:30 p.m. in the fellowship hall. And I know that the young people have been really enjoying it. So, um, we'll be praying God would continue to have his way in those meetings. Now, Sister Elizabeth has asked that you not clap after the song. And sometimes it's appropriate not to clap, you know, with a slow song. And sometimes God is moving on the hearts of people. Uh, you know, it's uh just if you're going to say something, say, "Praise the Lord." Amen. &gt;&gt; Sister Elizabeth, &gt;&gt; the Lord gave me this song the week after camp. The verses are a believer's desperate cry to God for a loved one who needs deliverance. The chorus is the believer's confession of faith to the person that they prayed for after prayer when the Lord has given them renewed vision. As I sing it out of my own burden, I trust it will encourage you. [Music] Lord, hear my cry. In my great need [Music] for my loved ones, I now plead [Music] arrest their soul. Halt this downward slide. Break down barriers. Strip away objects of pride if they are thine. Give me vision beyond wine to rise in faithful love and boldly say to them. [Music] Even as you walk away, I see you restored. Though your first love has died, I see it a lie. As you build a wall of lies, truth will prevail. I see you fully satisfied behind the veil. The tokens applied. There's blood on the door. That door is now closing. I'm still believing the Lord [Music] and eagle blind and wrapped in heavy chains stumbles down pleasures dark lane. Shake out the feathers replace with thorns. [Music] If through fiery pain a sinner's soul can be reborn. But even as you walk away, I see you restored. Though your first love has died, I see it alive. As you build a wall of lies, truth will prevail. I see you fully satisfied [Music] behind the wheel. You can know the wonder again. Perfect. Release in him. yield as he speaks today. Time is slipping away. [Music] [Applause] as you Walk away. I see you restored. Though your first love has died, I see it alive. As you build a wall of lies, truth will prevail. I see you fully satisfied. Fully satisfied. I see you there behind the veil and I'm belieing here behind the veil behind the veil. Amen. Thanks, Sister Elizabeth. Steadfast love of the Lord never ceases. His mercies never come to an end. They are new every morning. Great is thy faithfulness, O Lord. Let's sing it together. The steadfast love of the Lord never ceases. His mercies never come to end. They are new every morning. You praise the faithful steadfast love of the Lord ever come to an end. They are new every morning. New every morning. [Music] [Music] And as we're turning to the word, some of the kids are coming in from Sunday school. Let's uh sing together. Oh, come let us adore him. Do you love him this morning, saints? with all your heart. Amen. Let's be praying for the word as brother Bisco is going to be coming at this time. Oh, come let us [Music] Oh, [Music] heat, heat. Heat. Heat. Oh, heat, [Music] heat. Yeah. Heat. Yeah. Heat. Heat. Heat. [Music] Christ. Let's stand as we sing. For he alone is worthy. For he alone is worthy. Yeah. Christ, &gt;&gt; he alone is worthy. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. I know you have been standing and we're in his presence. Now, we've come into this service to be in his presence. This evening, we're going to have brother Ron Borthwick from Scotland. He and his wife have been visiting and they'll soon be returning home. So, tonight you want to come early and have a good seat. Our brother Ron Borthwick, I I know you're going to enjoy him very much. Did they pray for brother Timothy? M. We're going to pray as we get ready for the word for brother Timothy Moz. Well, brother Timothy's having a a a nose operation. It's not a serious operation, but it's going to kind of hinder him a wee bit for a little while. And uh so we want to pray for brother brother Timothy and like you to keep remembering of brother John Stall as well if you would that God will give him back his vision in his eye. Amen. &gt;&gt; And uh he's just waiting now for them to be able to do something a little bit further. Uh I'm going to ask the Lord just to bless us in the word this morning. I know you've already prayed, but I want to pray with you and then we'll be turning directly to the scripture. Heavenly Father, we are approaching now before your throne, making our requests and our petitions known as our brother Derek already prayed and requests of the people were made. We know that you heard every word. And now, Father, we come as your prophet said to this most important part, your word. We don't want anything to stand in the way. We just pray Lord that every human spirit will come in subjection to the Holy Spirit. And I pray, oh God, that you will take and demonstrate your word in power. And Father, may the Holy Spirit have absolute liberty here this morning in every vessel. Lord, I pray that I also will have the liberty of the Holy Spirit to minister those things that you would have spoken to speak where you would speak and be silent where you would be silent. And may you be glorified, Lord. There are shall no flesh glorif be glorified in your presence. And I pray oh God you'll give clarity of thought now and clarity of word and especially clarity of mind that the people may not be distracted but receive oh God what you have intended for this service. Bless all who are not in the visible audience wherever they may be streaming at this time or wherever oh God these words may go. I pray that you'll make it a blessing in the name of Jesus Christ for an eternal purpose and we will give you all the praise and glory in Jesus Christ's name. Amen. Amen. I'll have you take your Bibles and turn to John's Gospel if you would, the 14th chapter, and we'll read beginning at the 8th verse. Philip saith unto him, Lord, show us the Father, and it sufficeth us. Jesus saith unto him, "Have I been so long time with you? And yet hast thou not known me, Philillip? He that hath seen me hath seen the Father? And how sayest thou then, show us the Father? Believest thou not that I am in the Father, and the Father in me? The words that I speak unto you, I speak not of myself, but the Father that dwelleth in me." He doeth the works. Believe me that I am in the Father and the Father in me. Or else believe me for the very works sake. Verily, verily, I say unto you, he that believeth on me, the works that I do shall he do also, and greater works than these shall he do, because I go to my father. And whatsoever you shall ask in my name, that will I do, that the Father may be glorified in the Son. If you ask anything in my name, I will do it. If you love me, keep my commandments. And I will pray the Father, and he shall give you another comforter, that he may abide with you forever, even the Spirit of truth, whom the world cannot receive, because it seeth him not, neither knoweth him, but ye know him, for he dwelleth with you, and shall be in you. I will not leave you comfortless. I will come to you yet a little while and the world seeth me no more but you shall see me because I live you shall live also at that day you shall know that I am in the my father and ye in me and I in you. He that hath my commandments and keepeth them. He it is that loveth me and he that loveth me shall be loved of my father and I will love him and will manifest myself to him. Amen. God bless you. You may have your seats. Sometimes when we are ministering there are not just thoughts of a sermon but there are things that perhaps we've pondered as I've said here recently in recent weeks and the last few months there are things which we've pondered perhaps for months or years and then you approach the subject but uh you you don't declare clare it. You're not able to declare it or perhaps you just uh feel restrained a wee bit for one reason or another. Quite often the restrained is because you want to feel that the people are at a place where they can uh uh get a hold of your thought and uh also that it will not be misunderstood. That's very very important that you your thought will not be misunderstood. uh I want to speak uh continuing on with the subject last from last Sunday. This will be part two the separated life but it will come from a very very different direction. Uh the the subject here as we have Jesus said at that day you shall know that I am in the father. You shall know that I am in my father and you in me and I in you. There is this dual uh relationship this dwelling. I am in my father and you are in me and I am in you. &gt;&gt; Now I tell you that is right immediately as a great separation line. That's a huge line of demarcation because there just a largest portion of the population cannot really make that declaration &gt;&gt; that Christ is in me and I am in him &gt;&gt; and I that will be largely where I'm going to be dwelling. The word in is very very small word but it's a very very powerful word and I I will be wanting you to not just think about that but how how is that how is it that I am in Christ and Christ is in me? Is it because I sit in church? Is it because I've listen to a certain message? Is it how is it that I'm in Christ? Is it because I decided I would be in him? Uh how is it that he's in me? Where does that happen? How does it happen? Uh h how does this function? You know, uh what proves that he's in me and I'm in him? And there there certainly is some, you know, I'm asking a lot of questions because those questions are are naturally arise as we go through the through the service this morning. What Jesus said, "And at that day," and brother Brandham stops and he says, "And that is this day." Amen. &gt;&gt; Now, there's a reason for him to say that because Jesus said, "At that day, you shall know that I am in the father." Now, Jesus didn't begin being in the father in this day. &gt;&gt; He said, "You will just know that I'm that." In other words, there will there will come a time that there will be an understanding of how Christ is in God that they didn't have in previous generations. There will come a time when I'm going to reveal that the oneness of Christ in God. In other words, the Godhead will come into an understanding that they haven't had &gt;&gt; over all of these centuries. There will come a time. It isn't that Christ will commence dwelling in the father at that time that there'll be some uh new thing happen. It is that your knowing of that will change. There will be a time and he said very clearly at that day there will be a day when the people will begin to know something and the knowledge Jesus was specific about it. You will know that I'm in the father. There will be a day when this will be revealed at a level that it has not been revealed before. Not only that Christ is in the father but then that I that you are in me. There will be a a a a day when that will come to such a level because you can you can read all the books you wish to read, hear all the messages you wish to hear. But there's something that really sets this message apart and that is this is a bride bridegroom message distinctly a bride bridegroom message. You never hear any other ministers. You never hear any other sermons about uh out of the scriptures that so speak of the bride and the bridegroom because that kind of relationship, a bride bridegroom relationship, a husband wife relationship, they know something about being one. And that is what this day is. &gt;&gt; This is the day to know something of this oneness. And so that is what Jesus is speaking about. He's saying because the revelation of the oneness of the Godhead would be made known and Jesus Christ would call his bride to himself into a marriage. That's why Jesus is saying at at that day and the prophet says and that's this day because he knew that that was clearly his ministry and he could say authoritatively that is this day. I'm going to get some liberty. &gt;&gt; I'll be needing it here before long. Now, I'm just going to take my time. &gt;&gt; So, &gt;&gt; now in the message Christ is the mystery of God revealed, the prophet says, "Now notice God making himself known." See Jesus said at that day you will know and now he prophets addressing this he said and God making himself known he just stops we're not supposed to make converts to Christianity by a government it's not the system it's not the church organization it's not a denomination any kind of a system there's no system that can make converts to real true Christianity &gt;&gt; but by the revelation of Christ in you &gt;&gt; as God was in Christ. &gt;&gt; That's how you truly have a convert to Christianity is when a person realizes that Christ is in them &gt;&gt; and that they are in Christ. This is the revelation by the revelation that Christ is in you &gt;&gt; as God was in Christ. Not just that Christ was in you, but that Christ is in you as God was in Christ. And so when a person comes to and has a revelation God is in me as God was in Christ, I'll tell you what, you're not going to re you're separated. &gt;&gt; You're separated from all kind of other uh thought and belief. And so he said, "And as God was in Christ, Christ is in you. What God did in Christ, Christ does in you. What signs did God in Christ, Christ does in you." And he said, "Isn't that beautiful?" &gt;&gt; Jesus said, "At that day." And he said, "That's this day." &gt;&gt; At that day, that's this day. At that day, what day? When the revelation is made known, you will know that I'm in my father and the father in me, I in you, and you in me. When the revelations made not only known, manifest. &gt;&gt; It actually begins to show itself. It begins to appear on the scene. Something literally happens. a people arise that have something distinct and unique about them in that Christ is in them. Not just in theory, not just in a profession but in an actual possession, Christ is in them. And when that becomes not only known but also manifest, see at that day you shall know that I and the father are one. I'm in the father and the father's in me. Then when the revelation come forth then it's I in you and you in me. &gt;&gt; Good. Now the very life of Jesus Christ was a very unique and different life. We're talking about the life of Christ in an individual. the very life of Jesus Christ would be now in bride bridegroom and as as uh Mary a virgin Mary pregnant and not knowing any man but she was pregnantated by a spoken word of God and thus it shall be according to your word. Now the scripture says also which we read last week for such an high priest became us who is holy, harmless, undefiled, separate from sinners and made higher than the heavens. His life was indeed separate from sinners, separate from unbelief. He didn't sin. Sin is unbelief. There's no word that Jesus doubted. &gt;&gt; No doubt. There was it wasn't it was not possible for him to doubt for he was the word and he was separate from sinners. Now if that life if that Christ is in us how are we going to doubt the word &gt;&gt; his life was separate from sinners yet he was as we said the sinner's friend &gt;&gt; right &gt;&gt; and a man running from the presence of the Lord nothing ever compared with him he lived in a world now we're talking about I and you &gt;&gt; right &gt;&gt; that's we're talking about &gt;&gt; him in you. &gt;&gt; And now the prophet is describing his life. Nothing ever compared with him. &gt;&gt; Let me just stop there. The life which you have received by virtue of not some doctrine, not by virtue of this church, not by virtue of anything that you have done, but by virtue of God's forordained knowledge himself by his own grace and mercy. The life which you have received in you regardless of your failures or your weaknesses. I can say this on the authority of God's word. There's no life that ever compared with it. &gt;&gt; There's no life that has ever compared with what you have received. &gt;&gt; It's not a church. It's not a doctrine, friends. It's so far beyond that. You might not even realize what it is that you have received. It could be like a child not knowing what kind of an inheritance awaits them. They have no way of evaluating it. They have no way of appreciating it. We sit there and you know uh kind of glibly. Yeah. Well, it's it's all all wonderful. But your father's trying to tell you that what you have received there is no life that compares with it. &gt;&gt; He lived in a world to himself. There are some things which we experience in God you can scarcely share with anyone &gt;&gt; because it is too precious &gt;&gt; on one hand. &gt;&gt; It is it's just too unique. It's too wonderful and you can't just throw it out for all to see. &gt;&gt; No man ever spoke like him. You can't expect that your language is going to be the accepted kind of language. It's not the jargon of the day. You say things that sound even though you may speak in the language of of of the of the uh country, but you speak almost in unknown tongues because they don't understand what it is that you're saying. It is a it's a divine utterance. &gt;&gt; Jesus spoke in the language of his people, but they didn't. He spoke simply. He spoke so simply, but they didn't understand him. It's because he was coming from a a perspective of eternal things. He saw from a different from a different p perspective completely. And he said when he just opened his mouth, there was something about it. Something was different from anybody else. Somebody said he was just an ordinary man. But he said, "I defy that he was God. That's what he was. For no man ever spoke like him. No man could speak like him because he was the living word itself made flesh, the manifestation of the fullness of God. And now we are I have a multitude of scriptures everywhere and you know it well. But this life I'm simply describing as the prophet described it. But this life he said, I am in you. &gt;&gt; Right? &gt;&gt; I am in you. This is the life that's in you. And I think it'd be good for us to have a look and to describe that life. This is the life that's in you. &gt;&gt; Or you might say, "Oh, did I have so I have so many problems and this and that and things of life." Well, we'll get to that after a while. But the life that's in you is greater than your weakness. &gt;&gt; The life that's in you is greater than your failure this last week. The life that's in you is greater than those thoughts you had which you dislike. The life that's in you because what's in this body, this body is in this body has been by a natural birth, by a natural sexual birth has come into a life that is dying. &gt;&gt; This life is dying. &gt;&gt; But the life that's in you by virtue of this word is not dying. And the w life that came in you by virtue of this word has overcome the other life. &gt;&gt; By this you were born by the seed of your father when it came to the bedding ground of the womb of your mother and by the birth of the of the mother and the birth of the woman. You came into earth to die. But by virtue of the life of eternal life that came by the man Jesus Christ is stronger than that life. The life that came by the human seed is unrighteous. But the life that came by this seed here is righteous and can never be anything else. &gt;&gt; And it is stronger, more powerful than any other life. The life that's in you. And if Satan can get you to look at the manifestation of the life that you have by virtue of your natural birth and and get your mind consumed with the fact that uh that that this is the life that's dictating to you, this is the only thing that you know, you're not going to rise any higher than the life that you had by your natural birth, then you'll live a life of defeat. But when you continue to confess, I am in you and you are in me. &gt;&gt; Now, either Jesus was lying or he was telling the truth. And I say he was he could only tell the truth. &gt;&gt; He said, "I am in you &gt;&gt; and you're in me." &gt;&gt; Not that this is going to be at some time in eternity. It's now. &gt;&gt; I'm in you. And a prophet comes in this day and says that's this day. &gt;&gt; That is this day. &gt;&gt; And if you haven't entered into it yet, I'm saying I'm repeating his words. That is this day. &gt;&gt; If you have any hesitation, I don't care what kind of a uh what kind of a background you have. I don't care what kind of a nature you were born with. I don't care if God has spoken to you and called you. I can say to you if you are if you've been called by elective love that's this day and God wants you to know that by revelation [Music] &gt;&gt; God wants you to understand it. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And he said I will admit them prophets had their message. They had them that they had them then. They have them now. But there was a fullness of the Godhead bodily manifested there. Speaking of Christ, he was the unique one. The life that's in you is a unique one. &gt;&gt; Right? &gt;&gt; There isn't, you know, there isn't dozens of them. There's only one life. &gt;&gt; It's a unique one. &gt;&gt; Said, "I am in you and you are in me." And he was the one that had to face the issue with all his great powers that he had. He could have absolutely been king of the world and he will be to his saints. He said he is now. He's king of my life. &gt;&gt; King of our life. I crown thee now. Amen. Says for no man ever spoke like him. No man could speak like him. I want you to think about I am in you. There are some things that you will say. You may say a whole lot of things. You may say, "Well, it's warm in here. It's cold in here." You may say, "Well, uh, you know, I I like this color. I don't like this color. I like that, you know, garment. I don't like that garment." A whole lot of things that isn't unique. But then there are things which God has transmitted to you that you speak. It's not only unique, but not everybody can say that, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; A whole lot of people can't say that. And that's where the separation line comes. for a person by revelation to be able to stand up and say God dwells in me. &gt;&gt; Because he said so &gt;&gt; Jesus Christ and the very life that he lived lives in me. &gt;&gt; How do you know? I have something a light went on inside and I may not be able to give you all the proof of it but I will make the declaration of it because he declared it. I will declare it. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; What about the victory over the natural life? That's not our business. If you surrender to the word, if you just surrender to his promise, if you surrender to the Holy Spirit that comes and dwells in you, you will live the life is pleasing in his sight. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Now, God in his creation, brother Bram says, God was in his creation. God is in his creation. God is in his word. God is in his son. God is in his people. Everything that God was was put into Jesus Christ. He was co-equal with the father. He said, "Think it not robbery." But he was he was equal with the father. Now, so God was in his creation. God was in his word. God was in his son. God was in his people. I want to just move through those a little bit. God was in his creation. How did God come into his creation? I mean in his creation. Well, he said, "Let there be." Yes. &gt;&gt; And there was. &gt;&gt; And then God was in his creation. &gt;&gt; And he said, "Let there be." And let there be. And there was. And there was. Let there be light. And there was light. Let the earth bring forth. And it did. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; You weren't there to stew about it and sweat over it. &gt;&gt; Adam didn't have to worry about it. &gt;&gt; He wasn't even on the scene. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; And all all happened. And then God was in his creation by virtue of his word. He spoke it &gt;&gt; and it happened and then God was there. &gt;&gt; Just that simple. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Are we getting somewhere? &gt;&gt; Move on quickly. God was in his people. Now, here you're going to have to just think a little bit. God spoke to the children of Israel through the mouth of his prophet Moses. Thus, God was in his people. Didn't say that the people all had a marvelous experience. How was God in his people back at that time? God was in his prophet and his prophet was amongst them and God was in his people. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Good. They all didn't have what Moses had. But if they believed Moses, they fell under the benefits of the word that was coming out of his mouth. &gt;&gt; God was in his people. &gt;&gt; God was there. There wasn't Kora, Aubriam, all these others. They couldn't rise up and say, "God's behind my skin." &gt;&gt; But Moses could say that. Moses could say he was veiling God. And the scripture said, God speaking to Moses, "Now go now therefore go and I will be with thy mouth and teach thee what thou shalt say. I will be with your mouth and I will teach you what you shall say and thou shalt speak." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; God didn't say to Moses, "Now, can you will you speak?" No. God's telling him. And you will speak &gt;&gt; and you will say these things and they'll be unique because it'll be God in you that'll be saying it. &gt;&gt; It's not you anymore. It's going to be God in you. &gt;&gt; God's not asking him for his consent. God just says you're going to say it. &gt;&gt; That's all. You're going to say it. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Oh, &gt;&gt; Moses had all kinds of excuses. He says, "And thou shalt speak unto him and put words in his mouth." You're going to say it. You're going to put words in Aaron's mouth, and I will be with his mouth. &gt;&gt; Why? Because God was in Moses' mouth. &gt;&gt; And the words were not Moses' words. They were God's words. And I'm going to transfer them because he says, "I can't speak. I'll give you a vessel that can speak, but I'm going to be with your mouth. And you're going to say the words, and he's going to hear them, and then I'll be with his mouth." &gt;&gt; Amen. and with his mouth and shall teach you what you shall do. &gt;&gt; God was in his people. &gt;&gt; It wasn't that everybody had an experience, had some emotional thing or any other kind. It isn't even that they had a revelation. They just had to agree and believe the God of Israel, the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, the God of Jacob is amongst us. &gt;&gt; It's not a the Gegosites can't say this. The Jebusites can't say this. The Canaanites can't say this. The Hittites can't say this. The Amorites can't say this. The Amalachites can't say this. But we can say this. God's in his people. Why? We have a prophet, &gt;&gt; a vindicated prophet. And God blessed the people when they came to that realization. God's in us. And soon as the people rose up and says, I I don't, you know, I I don't think he's the only one that God's called. I don't think he's so, you know, I think God's God's upon all of us. Soon as they came into that, they came into God's disfavor and God swallowed them up and they died and withered and went away. We've seen the same thing in these days. &gt;&gt; God said further. Moses answered and said, "But behold, they will not believe me, nor hearken unto my voice, for they will say, The Lord hath not appeared unto thee." And it shall come to pass in the eth verse of Exodus 4, and it shall come to pass, if they will not believe thee, neither hearken to the voice of the first sign, they will believe the voice of the latter sign. God is dictating these things. You know, I I can tell you and you know it well even the things that are happening in these days and the things that took place in the prophet's ministry, it wasn't him that designed the meetings and and what was taking place and who was gathering on the prayer lines and who was to be it. It wasn't his design. It was God &gt;&gt; allowing people to come and hearing certain things and having the secrets of their heart revealed. And he said he said to uh he said to Moses, "And it shall come to pass if they will not believe thee. And what did the angel of the Lord even say to brother Brandham?" said exactly the same words. I'll give you two signs. And if the people won't believe the first one, they will believe the second one. For I'll make you to know the very secrets of their hearts. How can a person deny it's God when they're standing right there? No, I've never seen this man in my life and he's telling me the deep secrets of my heart, telling me all concerning my what the doctor said or what my husband said or what the preacher said or whatever more. How can they deny that? They had to walk away and say, "God's in the midst. &gt;&gt; God is here. &gt;&gt; This man can't know that. God knows it. &gt;&gt; God was in his people. Hope I can get you to see this. So, what God intended for his people to be placed in the mouth of his prophet, what God intended for the people, God placed in the mouth of his prophet. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And in Deuteronomy, Moses spoke further. He said, "I will raise up a prophet from among their brethren like unto thee," God speaking rather, "and will put my words in his mouth, and he shall speak unto them all that I shall command him." That is why, listen closely now. That is why the people when John the Baptist came on the scene asked him, "Art thou that prophet?" &gt;&gt; This is the one they were looking for. and he said, "No, I'm not that prophet." "Are you Elijah?" "No, I'm not Elijah." And yet, if you go to the uh Baptist Jameson Faucet and Brown commentary and go to Malachi 45 and 6, the last verses of the Old Testament, they would refer back to that exact uh exact scripture and John's exact answer. No, I'm not that prophet. And they said that although John knew that he was Elijah because of the of the prophesi pro prophecy concerning him and the angel's words concerning him he knew but he also knew that he did not exhaustively fulfill the scripture and there was another coming of Elijah &gt;&gt; there had to be before his first coming and before his second coming the same forerunner because he's a faithful forerunner, &gt;&gt; a faithful messenger. &gt;&gt; And so he said he'll raise up and he said, "And it shall come to pass that whosoever shall not hearken unto my words, which he shall speak in my name, I will require it of him. A prophet shall the Lord your God raise up among their brethren like unto him." Now God was in his creation. God was in his people. I'll come back to that. But God was in his son and this life is in you. I have to say that. If you say, "Well, do you have evidence of that?" You're making a declaration. Do you have evidence of that? Well, I Yes, I feel I have evidence of that. I have evidence to satisfy myself. I see God amongst his people. I'll say to you this morning, I feel privileged to be amongst you called out of God under this message. &gt;&gt; Uh we don't look at one another's flesh &gt;&gt; to see just you know and and examine your flesh. If I stood and examined your flesh and your life that way or you examine mine, we would all be total failures. And anybody who doesn't think he's a failure is a liar. We are failures in this natural flesh. That is not the life that Jesus is talking about. He didn't say, "I'll be in you, but you'll have some weaknesses, etc." He said, "I will be in you, &gt;&gt; and you will be in me, and I will be in the father, and that is oneness." &gt;&gt; That is oneness. And that's what this word says. And I will call everything contrary to that as a lie. And this is the truth. This is God's word. Now a person can willfully walk away from the word and then all kinds of things will happen. &gt;&gt; Absolutely. &gt;&gt; Now God was in his son. I want to take the word in and I'm being a little bit slow and laborious just for this time because I want you to be thinking to be in it is denoting that the object is surrounded by or included in the object I will be in you. He is surrounded by and included in in you. &gt;&gt; He's surrounded by your life, your activity. And then further, it is that it is that to be in is to be enveloped or restrained by certain limits. I want you to hold that. That's why Jesus said he could only do what he saw the father do because the father was in him. And he was in the father and he was restrained. He was restrained by what he saw the father do. And the father was restrained because he did not exceed the limits of what Jesus did. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Think about it. &gt;&gt; You see, there were things which were written in the word which Jesus did not fulfill. &gt;&gt; You follow me? So even God who had spoken the word did not fulfill all of the word in the life of Jesus Christ. Although he was the fullness of the Godhead, God's word was not completely fulfilled in Christ because there were things that spoke of this time that this Christ would do in this day that he did not do in that day. He would do it in this day. And that is why I believe in the unveiling of God. The prophet goes back and he says he was the son of man on earth as a prophet through the dispensation of the church ages. He's the son of God because God is a spirit and he's a son of God. So he came back as the Holy Spirit. And in the millennium to the Jews, he will be the son of David, the king. He will sit on a throne. in the in the millennium he will be son of David. So he is the son of man. All the same one. He's the son of God. He is the son of David. But between the son of God and between the son of God throughout the church ages and in the between the son of God and the son of David, he said there's a there's a breach there. There's a space there where he returns again as son of man. He said to fulfill the rest of it &gt;&gt; because there's portions in here that was not re fulfilled. One of them that wasn't fulfilled was and here he's on earth. But he says at that day &gt;&gt; that's another day. &gt;&gt; You will know at that day when that comes &gt;&gt; there's a day coming and now comes the revealing of the son of man with a vindicated prophet on earth standing here showing forth. It's the same life the same Christ dead raised the mimed healed all manner of things done. the secrets of the heart revealed in the same three pulls ministry and then he says and that's this day &gt;&gt; this is a day when that knowing will take place it couldn't be known back there so Jesus did not fulfill that back there he fulfills it now &gt;&gt; are you still with me &gt;&gt; and so God himself was constrained God was in Christ but and Christ was complete manifestation of God. So whatever whatever to whatever extent that the Lord Jesus manifested the father that was the limit that the father was known. &gt;&gt; So God was in Christ but God himself was constrained because he himself was was uh uh enveloped I would say within the life of Jesus Christ. And Jesus was also constrained by the father. He was in the father. The father was in him. Jesus was constrained because he said the son can only do what he sees the father do. &gt;&gt; So he could only go so far. &gt;&gt; It's wonderful. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It's wonderful. &gt;&gt; Yes, it is. &gt;&gt; As you think more about that, you'll be blessed. &gt;&gt; Jesus said, "I am in you." Jesus is not walking in a body down the street testifying of this message. He's constrained in you. &gt;&gt; To what degree you do it, to what degree the Holy Spirit moves you. &gt;&gt; That is the degree that he can do it. &gt;&gt; And he doesn't go beyond that. Amen. &gt;&gt; And you can't do it unless he does it. &gt;&gt; So once again, this duality, &gt;&gt; I am in you &gt;&gt; and you are in me. &gt;&gt; He's surrounded. &gt;&gt; This is humbling. This is absolutely, you know, it just baffles my mind that the Lord Jesus Christ would come down and step into your life and say uh and so that you could say he Christ is the center of my activity. &gt;&gt; He is the influence in my life. &gt;&gt; And what he influences me to do I can do and I can't go beyond that. &gt;&gt; If I go beyond that, it's just human works, a human effort. And so it is to be restrained by certain limits. To be in also is denoting the sphere of activity. This is the sphere of our activity. Now you may be a farmer, you may be a carpenter, you may be a mechanic, you may be a businessman or whatever more. You may be a housewife. you you may have some other activity whatever more whatever you people do I'm a student I'm I'm gaining an education whatever more this Christ who is the word &gt;&gt; must indeed be the center of the sphere of your activity whatever we do I do in the name of Jesus Christ I do it that he will be glorified I do it that he will be exalted if I if I'm blessed or I I I I gain some knowledge or I gain in a certain specific profession. I am going in this direction that he will be honored, that he will be glorified. &gt;&gt; To be in is to declare that you are within the influence or the scope of I am within the influence of that one that I am in. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And he is in me. Jesus said, "Believest thou not that I am in the Father, and the Father in me. The words that I speak unto you, I speak not of myself, but the Father that dwelleth in me, he doeth the work." &gt;&gt; So Jesus was saying, "I'm not doing this. He's doing it." &gt;&gt; How is he doing it? Because he's in me. &gt;&gt; How was God in Christ? Well, he was conceived. This very seed was conceived. It was a spoken word. Let me shock you. If you even plan to see the pearly gates, you won't even see the shadows of the pearly gates unless there's a life that's in you today that came by spoken word. &gt;&gt; And the very spoken word that brought forth Jesus Christ. You say, "Well, the prophets prophesied, a virgin shall conceive." I'll tell you something else. God sent a prophet right in this day to declare who you were &gt;&gt; and to declare a word. And it's either believed or denied. It's either believed or disregarded. And that that in itself that that designates where that person is. That's right. &gt;&gt; Jesus said in John 14:11, "Believe me that I am in the Father and the Father in me, or else believe me for the very work's sake." So what he's saying, if you don't want to believe that the Father's in me and I'm in the Father, if that's too farfetched, if that's too deep for you, &gt;&gt; well, just look at the works. Where did they come from? &gt;&gt; And even when they looked at the works, that didn't convince them. &gt;&gt; And neither will it today. &gt;&gt; It's the same thing. Say, "Oh, well, you know, you have long hair, you dress a certain way, you speak a certain way." Yeah, it's nice. I I really admire a lot of those things, but but you know, it's not for me. It's too strong for me. Are you one of those group? Are you a member of that group or whatever more? It's too strong for me. It it takes too literal position for me. Well, that's fine, but they but they see they see something there that's manifest. If you don't believe that God is in me, God is in you. If you don't believe that God's in the church, well, at least believe it for the work's sake because I declare if a person just looked honestly at the thing. You know, we were talking here the other day and there was a radio broadcast, a radio broadcast uh on a Vancouver station, one of the major stations, and they were having a huge discussion over the problem of marriage and divorces and the percentage of divorces and it was just it just uh skyrocketing and they had all you know not really looking for the answers but they were looking at the problem. such an enormous enormous problem. And so, uh, and they had all the percentages and everything else. And so, I called in and I said, "Well, I'd like I'd like you to, uh, I'd like to be able to say something about this." I said, "I'm a minister and I've conducted I forget how many at that time, maybe 75 or so marriages." And I said, "Our percentage of divorce is just a fraction of what you people are talking about. Just a fraction. &gt;&gt; Maybe like about 3%." Well, thank you. Click. &gt;&gt; They didn't want to talk about that. &gt;&gt; Were they looking for an answer? Not a chance. You know, if somebody had said, "Uh, listen, I know where you can make, uh, you know, 3%," and somebody else says, "I know where you can make 30% on your investment." You wouldn't say, "Click, I've had enough of that." Say, "Where is it?" &gt;&gt; I'd like to know where some of the success is. Do they want to? If you don't believe that God is amongst us, believe it for the work's sake. &gt;&gt; Believe it for the evidence. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And I have found that when that evidence becomes so uh uh so what shall I say so out in front &gt;&gt; that it people do get afraid of it. &gt;&gt; They actually get afraid of it. &gt;&gt; Can you imagine a life there never was a life like his life. Can you believe that? &gt;&gt; There never was a life. Do you believe that? &gt;&gt; There never was a uniqueness like the life of Jesus. &gt;&gt; How do you align? How do you get the things lined up in your mind that people just like the people of this day no different than back then? How do you get the lame that walked, the dumb that who's was loosed? How do you get those that threw themselves in the fire and in epileptic fits and was delivered? How do you get Lazarus raised from the dead? I'm talking about a small local country. &gt;&gt; This is not hundreds of millions of people. This is a small population. How do you get the things that are recorded in Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John? And how do you end up each of those chapters with a man hanging on the cross? &gt;&gt; Because that perfect life was too strong for them. &gt;&gt; And they like the works and they like the bread and they like the fishes and they like the miracles and all of those things that that were exciting to the flesh. But it was when he said, "I and the father and are one." &gt;&gt; That's where it was. And that's why a message like this morning, it's just not it's not that easy to digest because there's all kinds of things within your mind and within your being and within your past and within your expected future, your anticipated all kinds of things want to war against that. &gt;&gt; Want to chop at it, want to belittle it, want to disgrace it in your mind, all kinds of things. And I'm here today to say to you, deny that. You have dwelt on that long enough. You've dwelt on the failure. You've dwelt on the negative long enough. Deny that and confess this and try that for a change. In fact, it's more than just try it. Say, "I'm going to accept that. I'm going to believe that. I'm going to practice that and watch this other be defeated." We've had negativism long enough &gt;&gt; except in the name of Jesus Christ. What he said, I &gt;&gt; am in you. &gt;&gt; And there will be a day coming and the prophet comes and says that's this day and he is in me. &gt;&gt; His life is in me. &gt;&gt; Now you go to reasoning. Well, how does it and how does this? I don't know. &gt;&gt; I can't even figure out how bumblebee flies. How am I going to figure out this one? &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; All kinds of things I can't figure out. &gt;&gt; And Jesus answered and said unto them, "Verily, verily, I say unto you, the Son can do nothing &gt;&gt; nothing &gt;&gt; of himself. If he can say I can't do I can do nothing of myself. Surely we can say the same thing. That's what that life said. &gt;&gt; And he said I will be in you. And surely then we can say I can do nothing of myself of any eternal value of any eternal worth. I can do nothing of myself but what this life does in me that will be eternal. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; I may say a lot of idle words, but the words that come from that life, &gt;&gt; that'll be different. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; It's the life. You know, we try to make ourselves a separated people. People dress all kinds of ways. They have all kinds of veils and gowns and all kinds of robes and all kinds of things because that that's not what separates a person. That's why I said last Sunday, you may have long hair. You may wear a long dress. You brothers might be just as clean as a whistle. All the rest of it, and you think that separates you. No, that doesn't identify. All kinds of people do that. &gt;&gt; So, we got a nice home. We got a nice family or all kinds of nice families, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; All kinds of nice people. &gt;&gt; It's not because you're blessed or you're not blessed or because you're healthy or because you're sick. It's not has nothing to do with it. Absolutely nothing to do with it. Nothing to do with it. We're human and we're so prone. Oh, because I'm dressed a certain way and I'm identified and they look at you and say you're different and and so we're thankful if someone has has a inquisitive or curious mind because they say, "Well, you you do look different." You're thankful for that. But that's not what separates you. &gt;&gt; What separates you is the life. &gt;&gt; And the only thing that on the outside that can count is something that results as a result of that life. Right? &gt;&gt; So if the life that is in you and then you have a certain conviction about things say I'm not going to do that anymore. &gt;&gt; I'm not going to dress that way anymore. I'm not going to conduct myself that way. I'm not going to say those words anymore. &gt;&gt; I'm sure most everybody here at one time or another when I came out of the world, you know, they had a certain certain manner of speech and then one time you said it. Maybe you said it all through your life. Then one time you said it and you just felt a sting just inside. What was it? It was that life that was in you now giving a conviction about that. That was Christ in you. And the Holy Spirit is beginning to dictate. He say, "I'm not going to do that anymore." It was. And that's the only way that the outward man or the outward person can be a separated person. But what really separates you? You speak strange to the world. You see things differently. You cannot see things the way other people would see them. You're separated. The life that's in you is dictating to you what you are. And you become a separated person as Jesus was separate. Although he was a friend, you have associates, colleagues, you work with them. You have your peers, whatever more that you may be, you know, in your studies with and and at your workplace and whatever more and and and uh you may be considered a good friend of them. But Jesus was a friend of sinners, but he was separate from sinners because of the life that was in him. &gt;&gt; All right? So God was in his son. Now the Bible says in John 1:14, "And the word was made flesh." You know, I've been ministering for a lot of years, but still things mystify me. And I was I was struggling with this this week. Say, "Do you struggle over things?" Yeah, I don't struggle. I don't wrestle with it, but I I I struggle with it. I think I'm going to say to the people on Sunday, you know, we hear it all the time. The word was made flesh. Hello. The word was h how does that happen? How how is the word? How is the word made flesh? This flesh came through natural birth of my father through my mother. How is this? And quite frankly, I had a big problem this week. And the big problem was I was seeing and I was trying to comprehend the holiness of God. The absolute purity, the holiness of God that is so indescribably righteous. I thought, how do I even come into his presence? How do I, poor human seem like you have all kinds of things, filthy, dirty things hanging on you in the world. And I, how can I say that? Something that uttered out of the very mind of God and spoke it and took men and captivated them and they uttered these holy words and they were inscribed and left to us in a book called the Bible. How is that word from the mouth of Almighty God, how does that become flesh in me? you're quiet and I was quiet. I said, "God, my mind can't get around that. I can't grasp that. I'll just have to believe it. &gt;&gt; I'll just have to believe it." And as I as I took that position, something wonderful be to happen. That's when I begin to realize when I hear down in the resources of my soul, I hear a word and the words sound too wonderful for me. It tells me I can be free. It tells me I can live forever. &gt;&gt; Right? tells me things that I can't grasp with this impunity mind of mine. It tells me things that are too glorious. &gt;&gt; True. &gt;&gt; My mind can't even think. I can't even grasp the holiness &gt;&gt; of God, let alone to try to grasp how that life is going to come and live and become flesh in me. &gt;&gt; Now, this is where it gets strong. I'll tell you what, friends. The denominational world know nothing about what I'm speaking about today. &gt;&gt; Nothing. &gt;&gt; Don't even come near it. We only can approach it because a a messenger has brought it and exposed the whole thing. Says there it is. Eat it. &gt;&gt; There it is. Believe it. &gt;&gt; And it can never come into reality in our lives unless we do. &gt;&gt; Take it and assimilate it and keep it and hold it and embrace it. I have so many things I want to bring to you. And as I pondered upon this, I thought the life that consumes most of my time, so much of my time, and so much of my thoughts, it's life that takes, you know, I'm going to step into the car. I'm going to run down while you want me to get a loaf of bread. Uh, you know, we take out the garbage. We mow the lawn. We go to school. You got your studies. You got your books. What you're going to do, what you're going to be. You maybe got, you know, you got doctor's appointments and dentist appointments and whatever more. We got a a life that's just a normal life. And we're all consumed with this kind of a thing. But when we start to think of, excuse my pacing back and forth, but we start to think, I start to say, how is this word, how is this righteous, holy God, how is this word going to be made flesh? Because that in reality is what has to happen. &gt;&gt; That is what the prophet's talking about. I said, "Oh God, give me some scope of understanding here of what's taking place. Help me to convey some of this to the people this morning. this this life that was so separated. This life that was so unique. This life that was so marvelous. This life that was so holy. How is that going to come? I understand it in Jesus Christ. But how's it going to come into me? &gt;&gt; It's not some figment of the imagination. Everybody talking today they're all born again. That's a lot of nonsense. &gt;&gt; Well, I I shed some tears. All kinds of people shed tears and weep. I've been to an altar. Millions have been to an altar. &gt;&gt; There has to be something that is an actual happening, a reality &gt;&gt; that takes place. &gt;&gt; How's that going to be? I just Here's the recipe. You hear it. You hear his word. &gt;&gt; Not necessarily a preacher's word, but you hear his word. How does his word come? His word comes from the scripture and his word comes vindicated through his prophets. &gt;&gt; The Lord will do nothing unless he speaks it or reveals it or through his prophets. He speaks it in his prophets. &gt;&gt; We believe that &gt;&gt; we have received a message. God has vindicated that message. You receive that word. Then the Holy Spirit who's brooding over the entire earth at this moment. I'll tell you what he's brooding for. He's looking for a seed &gt;&gt; that he can brood over. A seed. &gt;&gt; He broods over stones and it doesn't bring There's a lot of earth that has no seed in it. And there's a lot of earth that has tears in it. &gt;&gt; It has all kinds of seed in it. It has thistles in it. It has all kinds of things. But the Holy Ghost is brooding over the earth to find that seed that came out of the mouth of God. And when he finds it, he stays there and broods over it till that seed comes to life. And when that seed comes to life, that seed is stronger than the seed that brought this body into life. &gt;&gt; Stronger. stronger. My brother, my sister, the seed that brought this body into life will take me to a grave. But the seed that came in by believing his word will take me to heaven. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; It's stronger. &gt;&gt; You got your mothers, you got your fathers, you got your ancestors, and we thank God for that. But I have a parent in heaven, &gt;&gt; my father. [Applause] who let seed come from his mouth, &gt;&gt; spoke it, &gt;&gt; and a man believes it &gt;&gt; and that springs to life because then the spirit comes to that seed. Yeah. &gt;&gt; A human spirit came to this natural life and I came out of my mother's womb as you did and we gave that breath of life and maybe had a spank so that we would be startled and we we cried out &gt;&gt; as the prophet said in an unknown tongue. &gt;&gt; Cried out. Nobody knew what we were crying about but it said one thing. We've come to life &gt;&gt; and everybody's happy. The child came to life. &gt;&gt; Many do not. They're still born. They had a perfect conception. Nothing wrong with the seed. Nothing wrong with the pregnancy. Nothing wrong with the birth. Nothing wrong with the forming of the child. The child has 10 fingers, 10 toes. It's perfectly fine. But if it doesn't take that breath of life, if that spirit doesn't enter, that human spirit, it'll never animate. &gt;&gt; We don't know what it's going to be like. &gt;&gt; We don't know whether it's a, you know, a timid person or a a boisterous person. We don't know what they're going to manifest. But when that spirit came and likewise so it was when the spirit of God came to the word of God and a life came within it. Hallelujah. And a call came and you became something you never dreamed you could become. You became a liberated, free son and daughter of God. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. That's thus sayith the word of God. &gt;&gt; And that is the one when Jesus said, "I will be in you." &gt;&gt; That's how he's in you. &gt;&gt; I will be in you. &gt;&gt; And you'll be in me. And you couldn't understand this at this level had not a prophet come and spelled it out for us. And I'm seeking to bring it to you this morning. Another few moments, please. He said, "The fullness, all that was in Christ was poured into the church." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Do you believe that? Yes. &gt;&gt; All that was in Christ &gt;&gt; was poured into the church. &gt;&gt; Jesus was the fullness of the Godhead bodily. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And that fullness was poured into the church. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; An invisible union of the bride. Now, it's narrowing down. So, I want you to really pay strict attention. He said, "And so was God manifested in the beginning. And finally he was appeared as Jehovah God the father. Then he appeared as God the son in Jesus Christ. Now he's appeared as God the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; The same God all the time. Three manifestations of the same God. He said, "And now we find that in each generation, God has allotted his word from the beginning." Just like evolution came, first thing God created probably was botney life and then he created animal life and then he created human life next. Kind of an evolution rising higher. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So has it been? You got the evolution now. So has it been in his church &gt;&gt; justification under Luther. And he stops and says that's pulling his bride out. Now &gt;&gt; this is different. He's not creating a creation so that God can be in his creation. &gt;&gt; He's not even creating a nation. Oh, there was I could have keep you here half the afternoon speaking about how God, you know, separated his people by separating Abraham out from his people. Then he separated a nation out of all the nations out of Abraham. And then when that nation became immersed in slavery in Egypt, God separated them again. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And then they married and they married with the Moabites and God hated that. and despise that idolatry and so on and so forth. But they continued on righteous kings, unrighteous kings, all the rest of it. And then they come to the come to uh the time when Jesus came and then he separates once again. He's bringing one out of that nation who's totally separate of sinners. And so he said, and so now he's pulling out his bride. The church was born. You following me? Yes, &gt;&gt; the church was born on the day of Pentecost and it continues for some time and then they begin to uh merge the word once again and take in a trinity doctrine and all of these things and God has to do another separation. So he begins to call out a people. Now he's pulling out his bride. He pulling out his bride bride. Not just a church now pulling out a bride because a bride knows an intimacy of the one who's calling her out. Much more than and then a God in heaven calling out a church. &gt;&gt; Much more than even God calling Abraham and saying, "Leave your people. Leave your kindred to a place I'll show you." That was wonderful. But that's not the intimacy of a bride in a bridegroom. &gt;&gt; Amen. Jesus, even Jesus walking the streets of Jerusalem and in Israel manifesting himself that was marvelous and dying the death without without which we would all be lost. That's absolutely glorious. But yet there was not an intimacy with Jesus and Israel as there is now &gt;&gt; more and more. The prophet says more and more is the time the evolution was more and more until from the botney life until it finally came up into a into a man in the image of God. More and more uh Israel being evoluted evolved all the way through the Old Testament till there came Jesus Christ the son of the living God. And then the church then the spirit that was in Christ came into the church and now the church is born and now the church is moving. And then it goes into darkness and it goes into denominationalism and it goes into the slavery of Rome. And then once again God is making separation. And out comes a Luther. Now starts another evolution. Now comes the justification coming up through the through the lower part of the body evolving it up. Then comes the sanctification. Amen. &gt;&gt; More and more. And then comes the gifts of the Holy Spirit more and more. So he said he he's creating his bride. justification under Luther, sanctification under Wesley and so forth. See he said the evolution of the spirit giving being given more and more because the body's building coming to the head which is Christ the body of Christ coming up to the head building it up building it up and evolution and friends we're not in the feet &gt;&gt; you're not in the thighs &gt;&gt; you're not in the breast &gt;&gt; hallelujah &gt;&gt; the head has come to the body &gt;&gt; and in that day you will know I have And I am in &gt;&gt; I'm in the bride. [Applause] &gt;&gt; You may not feel it. You may not even be able to say that by any sensation that you have. All you need to know and if you want to know what brother Biscll did today, I just said again in prayer in the sincerity of my heart. I said, "God, a lot of things I don't know. One thing I do know, you were in that prophet." &gt;&gt; One thing I know, you spoke those things. One thing I know, that pillar of fire was there and revealed the very secret of those hearts. And whether I feel anything, whether I sense anything, I will make this statement. God, you were in the people. &gt;&gt; God is in his people once again. Hallelujah. More so than at any time in the human history, God is in his people. God came amongst us. And that is why he comes to the unveiling of God. The unveiling of God. He's trying to say it as clearly as he can. He trying to tell them God is behind skin. And then he brings it down and down until he says, "And God, this God is behind your skin." Amen. &gt;&gt; It's not enough just to say it wasn't a prophet, &gt;&gt; but now &gt;&gt; God was even showing because God always did in his prophets what he wanted the people to receive for themselves. &gt;&gt; God, that was God. friends. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; If you know nothing more and don't get anything more out of this service than to be able to go home today and go out of these doors and say, "God of Israel, God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, God, you came." And that is how there's many, many places. I wouldn't have time to go into them now. When brother Brandham made the he made the reference that way, he referenced it that way. And then he would say, "God is in his church." &gt;&gt; And he'd be right at the moment of displaying that God was right there. &gt;&gt; Now, you see, he's being kind, but quite frankly, what he was doing, saying, "This God that is in me is in the church." &gt;&gt; Right? &gt;&gt; And I'll prove there isn't anybody else. &gt;&gt; You're a nice group of people. And you may think well of me. I trust you do. But I can't prove what he proved. I can't say it just that way. I cannot say now in the next few moments we'll I'll show you the father just can't do that. But he could, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; Cuz he knew he was called to do that thing. But I can do something. I can say that God that ordained him and brought him there, that's my God. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And that God that spoke out of his mouth, that's my God. &gt;&gt; And I have heard those words. &gt;&gt; And I have believed those words. &gt;&gt; And now by virtue of that, that spirit has come to those words. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And gave me a life I didn't dream I could ever have. I have that life. And by virtue of that action, I can say God is in me. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. God is in me. God is in you. &gt;&gt; You need to say that. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Why don't we say that? God is in me. Hallelujah. Say it again. God is in me. &gt;&gt; I have believed his word. &gt;&gt; I believed the spoken word. And I know that was God in that prophet. And I know that that God is in me. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; I don't care what you feel. &gt;&gt; You can feel like a you can feel like a telephone pole if you want or you might feel like like you're in heavenly places. That has nothing to do with it. It has to do that you can say that. &gt;&gt; And you don't hardly need a a revelation. You just need to acknowledge that was God. &gt;&gt; Maybe you didn't see it. I saw it. You're listening to a live testimony. You're leaving to a You're listening to an eyewitness. And one day, I may not be here, but I want you to be able to be anchored and say, "We had as a pastor, a man who heard it, a man who saw it, and I believed his words, and I have it in the book, and I have it on the tape, but I have a living testimony, and I listen to it, and I heard it for some years, and I believe in that, God." And just by making that declaration, change your life. &gt;&gt; And you'll be able to say years down the road, I never believed I could have this kind of a life. I didn't know. Listen to me, my friends. By doing that, I can I'll tell you this. In the name of Jesus Christ, the blessings of God are already on that word. You don't have to ask for blessings. You simply have to receive that word in its fullness, and you are blessed. God bless your home. God bless your children. God bless your basket. God bless your store. God bless your health. God bless your job. God bless you. &gt;&gt; And he may bless He may bless you in allowing you to suffer in some way that will get him glory. And I might say if so, let it be. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. God is in his people. &gt;&gt; God is in his bride. I'm going to close. Just after the day of Pentecost, there came a young man and his name was Stephen. Steven became the first martyr. He was a young man. He didn't get to live very long. He stood there that morning at the Sanhedrin court and they accused him and he stood alone, just him alone up before the great Sanhedrin court. Maybe two or three thousand Jews or 5,000 Stephen, he was just a young man. Young man, he had a revelation that the spirit that came on the day of Pentecost was in him. &gt;&gt; He knew that he believed the words of the Messiah. &gt;&gt; And he knew that God was in him. &gt;&gt; He began to speak to the Sanhedrin. standing there, he said, with a pointing finger. And the Bible said that when he walked out there, looked like his face was that of an angel. &gt;&gt; That doesn't mean he had a light shining from his face. An angel would be a messenger that knowed what he was talking about. &gt;&gt; Like his face was shining with the glory of God. He had a confidence. &gt;&gt; Didn't come from the Sanhedrin. Didn't come from the Levites. Didn't come from the high priest. He knew where he stood. Some of you young people just coming into that place where finally for once in your life, you know where you stand. &gt;&gt; You know what you believe. &gt;&gt; And God wants to take that youth and that energy and use it for the kingdom of God. Never be ashamed of it. And don't even hesitate for a moment. Just say, "I've been called on the scene for this hour." [Applause] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen. &gt;&gt; As Steven was &gt;&gt; and his face was like a brilliant light &gt;&gt; and he walked out there not afraid of death. He wasn't afraid of nothing &gt;&gt; because he knew what he was talking about. He says, "And Steven walked out there before the Sanhedrin court like a sheep among a pack of wolves. He was hounding for his blood. And they accused him and pointed an accusing finger at him. And what did he do? He said, "Men and brethren, the God of glory appeared to our father Abraham." He started right back at Abraham when Abraham was separated while he was yet in Mesopotamia and before he was called out and he went ahead and brought all the history down of Abraham and how that all through that he would bring in the Gentiles and when he got to a certain place looked at him full of the Holy Ghost and they couldn't wait any longer to get their hands on him and he said you stiff necked and uncircumcised in heart and ears you always resist the Holy Ghost like your fathers did so do ye. And he said he was God's advi advertisement. &gt;&gt; Speaking about being an advertise, talking about being a billboard and saying to the people of this day, you're God's billboard. Hallelujah. You're a billboard before the world. You're making a declaration to the world of what is holy and what is righteous. Hallelujah. You're a you're a a messenger for this message. What would this message be just in a book or a tape form if it wasn't a lived out life? And that's the whole core of my message. It is a lived out life. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Glory to God. I say to you in the name of Jesus Christ, God in this generation, he is restricted &gt;&gt; by what you do, by what you say because God is in his people. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. God's expressing himself in his people. &gt;&gt; Don't be ashamed of him. &gt;&gt; And he said, he said, "We don't have Oh," he said. And then, uh, excuse me. He said, "There may have been 5,000. How many of them got saved?" He said, he said there was 5,000 where Stephen was. And he says, "How many got saved?" Brother B said there was one. &gt;&gt; He never accepted it right then. &gt;&gt; But years later, &gt;&gt; there was one who held the coat. &gt;&gt; His name was Saul. &gt;&gt; And that stayed on Saul's mind. I held the coat &gt;&gt; of Steven. I saw the glory of God. What he saw was the life of Christ in one young man. Yes. &gt;&gt; Saul had young Pharisees standing there consulted and gave witness to his death. And when he saw that advertisement of the power of the resurrected Christ in that little fellow, he said he never got away from it. &gt;&gt; Steven never even knew it. &gt;&gt; Saul, that Pharisee was watching and giving consent. Stone him boys. layers coated at your feet. Yes. Torn him. &gt;&gt; He's one of these we have to get. But his Saul could never get away from that. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And I declare to you, there's people that walk to you, walk with you. There's people who live beside you will never get away from the testimony of Jesus Christ that's in your life. And wouldn't you be rewarded if you lived a whole life and brought one on the other side? Just brought one. &gt;&gt; You young fellows, you young ladies or this congregation, wouldn't it be worth it if just one steps on the other side and says, "Let me shake your hand. You're live. You live beside me. You were my neighbor. I never told you what was going on, but I saw the glory of God in your faith. I saw how you lived. I saw how you conducted business, how you conduct I saw how you handle your children. I'm here because of you. &gt;&gt; Oh, my brother, my sister, you're going to say, "Heaven just became sweeter. &gt;&gt; Heaven just became sweeter." says that same Paul, that same man Paul, that one standing there that morning led tens of thousands of souls to Christ because one man was willing to give his life as an advertising board for Jesus Christ. We don't have big audiences, Brother Brandham says. I say this to you now. We don't have to preach to 10,000. We don't even have to preach. We can be God's advertisement board. How do you know that your life? How do you know that your life might not start a young man on the gospel or some o some of you older men and you old women start them young men on the field out there to win 10,000 souls to Christ? It was because that he sought Christ in you. It was it it's you presented Christ to him in the simple power of the gospel. He said Paul never got away from it because he seen Christ reflected. He said, "How did Stephen do it?" Congregation, how are you going to do it? Said he never performed any miracles. Although he knew that Christ was in the was a miracle performer. He knew all those powers and things. But what did he do? He just presented his life in such a way that they seen that it was the power of Christ. You may never see a vision. You may never put your hands on a sick person and feel the charge of almighty God make a skeleton of a man turn back to life again. You may never see him standing out yonder in three or four rainbows. You may never see his image. You may never hear his voice, but still you can be his signboard. &gt;&gt; Do you believe that? &gt;&gt; Do you accept that? Does this congregation believe that? &gt;&gt; I may never do may never have a vision. I may never do great things. I may never lay hands on the sick. I may never preach a sermon. I may never do anything that is outstanding. But I will accept what God's vindicated messenger says. I am his billboard. I am his advertisement in this generation and I will show forth the life of Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; And that life is a separated life. Young people, don't try to mingle it and mix it up. It doesn't mix with all the stuff that's around you. Just say, "I'm so glad this billboard is different than all the other billboards. This is a different life, and I'm not going to try to make it the same." &gt;&gt; God be praised. Amen. &gt;&gt; I will be in you and you in me and I in the father and we are all one. Isn't that lovely? &gt;&gt; Isn't that lovely? &gt;&gt; Amen. This Jesus that we love so deeply is saying today, I am I am in you. And you're going to live this life. You're going to stand. You're going to be true. You're going to live this life because there's going to be a force in you, a power in you. And somebody's going to see that life might might be your children, might be your husband or wife, might be your neighbor, might be your friend, but they're going to see that life in you. That meant a lot to me. Even when I was I I I look at you young man. I put myself back there 17 and 18 years old and I had friends in the church and outside of the church. But when God got a hold of my heart, I began to realize that I was being drawn into. And let me say to you young people, God drew you into a special place. And he intends to carry on with that communion with you. And that has separated you from multitudes. When what has happened in the last few weeks took place that separated you from absolutely millions and millions of people your same age, you're beginning to experience something. You know, last Sunday, last Sunday night when I I was kind of specific. I said, "We want to sing." And it was the same God. And I asked I said I want only those of you only those that have that testimony that you want to make a declaration. It was God that did a great thing in me. I only want and I didn't know I actually had thought about it because I was thinking about it all through the service and I even thought I might you know if there was only 10 or 12 or 15 I might get the microphone and hand the microphone down and so they can say after one after the other. It was a great thing. It was a great thing. It was a great thing. I want to hear it out a number of mouths. And I thought, well, maybe at the very most we might have 50. But when you leapt up out of your seats and came forward, I tell you what, I will tell you before God and eternity can eternity will confirm this. God was very pleased. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He was very pleased with that kind of response. said, "I want to stand there and I want to declare to not only this people, but whoever sees it." I got an email says it looked like there were hundreds up there. I want to declare &gt;&gt; this testimony. God saw that &gt;&gt; and God wants you to continue and you'll experience even what your brother in the Christ and your pastor experienced. I began to realize there were there were some in the church and all of my so-called friends in the world that knew nothing about the relationship and they the experience that I was having having and I just want I declared in my within myself I vowed within myself I would live so that they could see it throughout life &gt;&gt; and I've never been sorry &gt;&gt; never been sorry once God is in his people once again friends &gt;&gt; God is in his people. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; We'll bow our heads. Heavenly Father, your word has been spoken. There's such an atmosphere here just now. And the people have believing hearts. They're just so receptive. And I'm praying that your spirit, oh God, will come and make every uh every word just such a reality. Lord, I pray that you'll bless this congregation, bless this people, Father, and let the testimony of them go far and wide around the earth or to whatever place you would have it be. May there be a man or woman here, Lord, that will live in such a way as serving the same Christ that Steven was serving. Lord, may we not lose sight of the God that is manifesting and showing himself in us. Do bless, Lord. There are those that are needy. Would you reach out now, Lord? Perhaps they feel insufficient. Perhaps they feel a lack of confidence, a lack of self-esteem. Let them relegate that to where it should be and pass it off to that natural birth and say, "But by the birth that you, oh Father, have given me, I only know what you have said concerning that life, a life that has never known defeat, a life that has never succumbed to the enemy." And now, oh God, let that individual or those individuals that you're speaking to just now rise above that, oh God. And I pray, Father, that the powers of hell will be broken and chains will be shattered in the name of Jesus Christ. And that what you desire to have accomplished, Lord, will be done so in Jesus Christ's name. Amen. I'll have you stand with me. And I I want to sing uh I think it's 2019. Hear the hear the cries of the shackle. And then and then we're going to sing God is in his people. Now we sing this quite often. We sing this and you sing it with a great deal of fervor and zeal. But there may be somebody here that you're feeling the shackles and you know that you're not as yet at as of this moment free. Let me just say to you, you don't have to be embarrassed. You don't have to be identified. You don't have to make a great big public statement. But I will say to you in the name of Jesus Christ, what you what you must do in order to be free, you've got to confess and say what God has said. And I would recommend that you say, "I will believe the words that were spoken this morning." I can tell you friends, this is not my thoughts. I didn't have this as my thoughts. I believe this came from God for somebody here. And maybe you're that Saul. Maybe you're that one and you just want to you'll just raise your hand while we sing this song and say, "I've had those shackles and right now I am denying their I'm denying their right to be on my body." Hallelujah. Glory to God. [Music] &gt;&gt; In the name of Jesus Christ, that the people of God be free. And whom the son says free is free indeed. Hear the cries of the shackles from the onset of time. For the chains of defeat, there's no peace. See the tears of the broken, the cry of the slaves. Is there no? &gt;&gt; Oh, how we love this. And then the crying is still the shadow. [Music] worthy. Oh, he's so worthy. Worthy worthy worthy. Heat. Heat. I say Yeah. Heat. Yeah. Heat. We're going to sing serve him and love him. But before we do, perhaps you feel restricted and bound and Satan has robbed you. I deny that enemy having any right on any soul. And if you're an inquiring, if you're a hungering soul, just now slip up your hand. If you've been bound, if you've been hindered and we're going to pray. This congregation is going to pray. There's going to be people praying that aren't even here in the visible audience. For all of those that are streaming, I say every believer pray. Let us bring the power of God and the deliverance of Jesus Christ to the in to the hungry heart and the desiring and the needy one. &gt;&gt; Father God, &gt;&gt; eternal in the heavens that has called us to this moment that has sent such a voice as you have. And I have testified today that you are in your people. I've testified today that you are in the bride of Jesus Christ. And as your prophet has declared it, lo Lord, so do I declare it. Even so, Lord, it is thus, sayaith the Lord, you are in your people. I am in you and you in in me. And Lord Jesus, it is that life. It is that desire within us, oh God, that is there to bring deliverance to those that are bound. And may Satan now be defeated in the name of Jesus Christ. Satan, we adjure you by the living God to depart from the individual that is seeking, that is reaching out, that is calling upon the name of the Lord. Call upon him and you shall be saved. Call upon him and you shall be delivered. Give him glory, all ye people, for this lamb has never known a defeat. He's not a defeated Christ. He's a victorious, conquering son of the living God. Oh, we bless your name. We exalt you, victorious Christ, lovely Lord Jesus. We exalt you. We praise your name. We praise your name. Oh, hallelujah. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And because we love you, Lord, &gt;&gt; we shall go on from here to serve you even with greater fervor. &gt;&gt; Anoint, oh God. &gt;&gt; Anoint, oh God, these that you have recently called, anoint them for service. Father, &gt;&gt; Lord, our brother Tony and brother Steven Keer will be leaving tomorrow morning, oh God, for some weeks in Brazil. I pray you'll be with them. And may this Steven, oh God, be another Steven. May someone see his life. May someone, oh God, some young person perhaps in Brazil, catch fire for the fire that you've ignited in his soul. We want to give you glory. I pray you'll give brother Tony words. Oh God, give him wisdom, Father, that comes not from man, but comes from the throne of God. Let the very thoughts of God, the very words of God be found in his mouth, oh God. And we're not depending on any human ability.
