[0:01] [music] all around.
[0:06] So let us praise [music]
[0:12] Jesus [music]
[0:14] now.
[0:19] We are standing [music]
[0:22] in his rest.
[0:27] Just sing it one more time.
[0:30] &gt;&gt; [music]
[0:31] &gt;&gt; We are standing
[0:37] on [music]
[0:39] ground
[0:43] and [music] I know that there are angels
[0:49] [music]
[0:50] all around.
[0:55] So [music] let us pray.
[1:01] Jesus
[1:03] found [music]
[1:08] we [music] are standing
[1:11] in his presence [singing]
[1:13] on holy [music] ground.
[1:18] &gt;&gt; Amen. Psalms 104:31, the glory of the
[1:21] Lord shall endure forever. The Lord
[1:23] shall rejoice in his works. Verse 33.
[1:25] [music]
[1:26] I will sing unto the Lord as long as I
[1:28] live. I will sing praise to my God while
[1:30] I have my being. My medit my meditation
[1:32] of him shall be sweet. I will be glad in
[1:35] the Lord. Amen. That little song that we
[1:38] used to sing came in my mind that
[1:40] repeats [music] those couple verses the
[1:41] other day. So, I thought that was
[1:43] fitting. God bless you. Welcome to the
[1:44] house of the Lord this morning. Are you
[1:46] here to hear the word? I trust that
[1:48] you've come expecting. Why don't we
[1:49] stand and let's sing that song? When I
[1:51] see the blood,
[1:53] &gt;&gt; aren't you thankful for the blood?
[1:57] &gt;&gt; Oh [music] Christ our redeemer
[2:00] died on the cross.
[2:03] Died [music] for samb
[2:06] [singing]
[2:11] [music]
[2:14] and I will pass [music] will pass for
[2:18] you.

[2:33] see the [singing]
[2:38] I
[2:43] will [music] sing.
[2:45] Jesus will save
[2:48] all
[2:51] that will do.
[2:54] [music]
[2:56] Glory.
[3:02] [music]
[3:05] When I [music]
[3:07] see you,

[3:28] is [music] coming all

[4:05] &gt;&gt; I will pass. [music] I will pass for
[4:08] you.
[4:11] [music] Oh great compassion.
[4:14] Oh love
[4:17] [music]
[4:22] [music]
[4:22] my peaceful shelter
[4:25] under [singing] the
[4:29] power to pass for you.

[4:57] [music]
[5:01] When I

[5:06] when I
[5:09] see
[5:11] [music]
[5:13] I will pass you.
[5:16] Hallelujah. What a promise. Amen. Why
[5:19] don't we sing that song? I'm sheltered
[5:20] in the arms of God.
[5:24] So [music] let the storms raise high,
[5:29] the dark
[5:33] [music]
[5:40] with beyond [music] the
[5:46] he was free
[5:51] &gt;&gt; [music]
[5:51] &gt;&gt; and on earth

[6:08] I feel [music] the touch
[6:12] of hand so [music]

[30:45] Because he lives, I can face tomorrow.
[30:48] &gt;&gt; We're going to ask brother Mikey [music]
[30:49] if he would come and sing for us. I
[30:51] [snorts] was I called brother Mike this
[30:52] morning and I asked him if he would
[30:53] sing. [music] I don't like doing that to
[30:55] people, but I've had it done to me. No.
[30:58] Um, I was listening to the podcast and I
[31:01] thought, they uploaded this song and it
[31:03] was uh, no matter what shaking. I was
[31:05] like, really the mic? Hasn't sung
[31:06] [music] that in a long time, so this
[31:08] must just be an upload from an older
[31:09] one. So I asked for the mic, he would
[31:11] sing that for [music] us. And so he was
[31:14] gracious and said yes. Amen. So no
[31:16] matter what's shaking, Amen. Because he
[31:18] lives, I can face tomorrow.
[31:21] Because [music and singing] he lives,
[31:25] I can face [music]
[31:27] tomorrow.
[31:30] Because [singing] he lives,
[31:35] all [music]
[31:36] fear is gone.
[31:40] Because [music] I know, yes, [singing] I
[31:44] know. Behold my future.
[31:50] [music]
[31:52] I'll
[31:54] &gt;&gt; because [music]
[32:00] he lives
[32:03] [music] I can face tomorrow
[32:08] because [music]
[32:12] all fear is gone.
[32:17] And [music] because I know, [singing]
[32:20] yes, I know he holds my future. [music]
[32:27] And [singing] life is worth the living
[32:31] just because [music and singing]
[32:33] he lives.
[32:43] Is that on now? Last time I didn't turn
[32:46] it on. a couple times it didn't turn on.
[32:50] God bless you, saints. And uh you know
[32:52] the song, so I trust you'd sing it with
[32:54] me. Um afterwards, there was a little
[32:58] chorus that was going through my mind as
[33:00] I was grinding meat throughout the week.
[33:03] I I just I was grinding some hamburger
[33:06] and I was just singing I want to live
[33:09] what you know what I'm talking about.
[33:11] And it it just kept going over my head
[33:13] and suddenly it was a little chorus. I
[33:15] thought maybe you'd want to share it
[33:16] with me and sing it. So, we'll see. Did
[33:19] you get that to to on the screen? I
[33:23] don't know. Okay, good.
[33:33] There [music] are winds of doctrine.
[33:36] There are stumbling stones. There are
[33:39] some [music] won't even shake your hand.
[33:44] I won't let that bother me. I'm standing
[33:47] on the word.
[33:49] Soon we're [music] getting out of here.
[33:51] That's the best news that I've heard.
[33:55] No matter what's shaken, [music]
[33:57] I'm hanging in.
[34:00] No push over Satan
[34:03] then sealed [music]
[34:04] in.
[34:05] No matter what's shaken,
[34:08] I'm pressing on.
[34:11] You're going to be shaken.
[34:14] When you [music] find out that I'm gone,
[34:18] I've heard enough words, Satan. [music]
[34:21] This box car's been packed tight. There
[34:24] ain't enough devils on the track to make
[34:27] me lose [music] this fight.
[34:31] It's too late to slicker. I've heard the
[34:34] conductor's call. [music]
[34:36] Inspector Jesus sealed me in. There's no
[34:39] way I [music] can fall.
[34:42] No matter what's shaken,
[34:44] I'm hanging in.
[34:47] No [music] push over, Satan,
[34:50] been sealed in.
[34:52] No matter what shaking,
[34:55] [music] I'm pressing on.
[34:58] You're going to be shaken.
[35:01] When you find [music] out that I'm gone,
[35:05] there are times I get so lost, seem
[35:08] battle, worn, and stressed.
[35:11] But I know the [music] word abides my
[35:14] strength throughout the test.
[35:18] Just [music] remember one thing. I hope
[35:21] you get this clear.
[35:23] That [music] no matter what's shaking,
[35:25] I'm standing without fear.
[35:29] No matter [music] what's shaking,
[35:31] I'm hanging in.
[35:34] No push over Satan [music]
[35:37] and sealed in.
[35:39] No matter what's shaking,
[35:42] I'm pressing on.
[35:45] You're [music] going to be shaking
[35:48] when you find out that I'm gone.
[35:51] No matter what shaking, [music]
[35:54] I'm hanging in.
[35:57] No push over, Satan.
[36:00] Then seal it in.
[36:02] No matter [music] what's shaken,
[36:05] I'm pressing on. [music] You're going to
[36:08] be shaking
[36:10] when you find out that I'm gone.
[36:14] [music]
[36:23] That door's good. Could you put them up
[36:25] back there, too? Cuz
[36:28] when I get nervous, I don't do that very
[36:30] well. [music]
[36:31] I singing all week long was going over
[36:33] my head in my sleep over and over and
[36:35] over. And I thought, "Okay, Lord, I've
[36:36] had enough. Let's sing it.
[36:43] Still can't see it though.
[36:46] Old man eyes. [laughter]
[36:51] Okay, I'll do the alternative here.

[39:36] Amen. Nice to see you all here today.
[39:40] We've got a full service. So, I'm going
[39:42] to uh move along without a whole lot of
[39:46] delay, but we've got some uh
[39:48] announcements that which we want to
[39:50] make. And uh we're
[39:55] so thankful we can report um brother
[39:58] John Andes and one van load is over in
[40:03] Victoria and next van load went to be
[40:06] witnesses over there with brother Matt
[40:08] Matthew Redell and uh so he took a group
[40:12] so there's two vans that are over in
[40:14] Victoria said they'll be streaming the
[40:16] meeting. So, God bless those in Victoria
[40:19] and Brother Alex and brother Al Sam and
[40:23] all of the others that are there. We're
[40:25] we're just pray that God will make them
[40:28] very very fruitful. They've had some
[40:29] wonderful time on the streets and uh we
[40:33] believe that you'll still be witnesses.
[40:35] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[40:37] &gt;&gt; We also we want to welcome our brother
[40:40] Yuri and sister Valentina Chuckov. I
[40:43] don't know if I pronounced her name
[40:45] exactly right. Uh, three of their four
[40:48] children are here and that's Anna and
[40:51] she's 18, Joseph is nine and Daniel is
[40:54] eight. I wonder if they would stand,
[40:56] please, so we can welcome them. Here we
[40:59] have them. They [applause]
[41:01] they are here from Sacramento,
[41:03] California.
[41:05] [applause] God bless you. They have
[41:07] already moved into a home in Ferndale
[41:10] and uh they will be part of the
[41:12] congregation here and we welcome you in
[41:14] the name of the Lord Jesus Christ. God
[41:16] bless you. [applause]
[41:22] There's one daughter that is just
[41:23] finishing college and she's 20 or 21
[41:26] years old and she will be uh joining
[41:29] them here in a in another short time,
[41:32] another week or two. Uh also, brother
[41:35] Yuri, for those of you that living on
[41:37] the on the US side, uh brother Yuri will
[41:40] be looking for employment on uh on that
[41:43] side. Now, you and I was impressed here
[41:46] a few weeks ago, perhaps two, three
[41:49] months ago. Uh they showed up, they
[41:52] drove all the way from Sacramento to
[41:54] come here for the Lord's table for
[41:57] communion
[41:58] &gt;&gt; and footwashing service. And I remember
[42:02] that that went down and deep in my
[42:04] heart. Brother Yuri, Sister Valentina,
[42:07] and uh first time I actually saw them
[42:10] was in Ukraine
[42:12] and right in the city where there's an
[42:14] awful lot of war and fighting right now,
[42:17] which is the city of Daetsk. And it's
[42:19] kind of a stronghold for the u Soviet
[42:24] people. I won't say Soviet people, but
[42:27] more for the Russian, those that want to
[42:30] lean towards Moscow. And there's a kind
[42:33] of dividing line in the country, and
[42:34] they're going through a lot of trouble.
[42:37] We we actually didn't only help to build
[42:39] that church. We provided all the funds
[42:42] for that church. And the people that
[42:45] worked through the winter, and I tell
[42:46] you, they worked like heroes. They're
[42:48] heroes in my books. And I believe hero
[42:50] in God's books. uh just a fire down on
[42:54] the in the basement to keep themselves
[42:56] so they could keep putting together the
[42:58] pipes and all of the concrete and
[43:00] everything. And I just say God bless
[43:02] them. They have one of the finest
[43:04] churches in Europe right now as far as
[43:07] it can hold. I think there was about 700
[43:09] people at the opening and it is
[43:12] remarkable. It's a center for the uh uh
[43:15] for for the distribution of the messages
[43:18] in uh throughout the Ukraine and
[43:20] throughout that whole region. And so we
[43:22] we're thankful uh for that and we ask
[43:24] you to remember them in prayer. But
[43:27] that's where I first met Brother Yori
[43:29] and Sister Valentina. And so we're happy
[43:32] to have them.
[43:33] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[43:34] &gt;&gt; Also, right after right after the
[43:37] message, the service will not be over
[43:39] when I'm done. Uh and I'm very conscious
[43:42] of that because we're having four that
[43:44] are being baptized
[43:46] &gt;&gt; and we're so indeed thankful for that.
[43:49] Uh, Sister Lesie Lee, her son Alex, and
[43:54] uh, her daughter Kitty Lee. All of them.
[43:57] I wonder if they would just stand.
[43:59] They're being baptized. And Sister
[44:01] Melissa Molley. Melissa, are you present
[44:05] here? We'd like you to stand if you
[44:06] would, too. Uh, Sister Melissa's right
[44:10] there. These are the four that are being
[44:12] baptized. Isn't that wonderful?
[44:14] [applause]
[44:14] God bless you.
[44:20] Uh,
[44:22] Sister Leslie's children, Alex and
[44:26] Kitty, are are twins.
[44:29] And, uh,
[44:32] you don't have to be ashamed of that.
[44:34] That's fine.
[44:37] We've got quite a few twins here in the
[44:39] church and even some triplets that
[44:42] belong to me down the line.
[44:48] Sister Helen Bsberger, nice to see you.
[44:51] God bless you. We've been praying for
[44:53] you.
[44:54] &gt;&gt; Amen. Hallelujah. Let's give Sister
[44:56] Helen a hand. [applause]
[44:58] Amen.
[45:03] Amen.
[45:04] &gt;&gt; We're very, very thankful for that.
[45:08] We're going to just change the order of
[45:10] the service for a moment and we want to
[45:13] have prayer with our brother Dominic
[45:15] Sangamina.
[45:17] Brother Dominic uh felt led and feels
[45:20] led and uh the Holy Spirit seemed to
[45:24] speak to him a name that he didn't know
[45:28] where it was of a town of a city and
[45:32] it's St. Jerome
[45:34] in Quebec.
[45:36] It is on uh So he looked it up. It's on
[45:39] the on the highway between
[45:42] Montreal and Ottawa.
[45:45] He doesn't know anybody there.
[45:48] Doesn't know any church there. We don't
[45:49] know any church there. We don't know
[45:51] anybody there. But he said this is a
[45:54] name that has come to him and he is to
[45:56] go there. And that doesn't happen every
[45:59] day. So we want to pray for him. And
[46:02] then he says, "From there, I don't know
[46:03] what's going to happen there, but when
[46:05] we're done there, I plan to go to
[46:07] Ethiopia."
[46:09] Our brother Dominic has been responsible
[46:11] for
[46:13] uh assisting to get another a couple of
[46:15] churches started in Africa. And so we
[46:18] want to have prayer for brother Dominic.
[46:21] If you would come forward, Brother
[46:22] Dominic, where you wish to pray with
[46:24] you.
[46:40] Aren't these Congalles people regal?
[46:45] I wish I was that tall, brother Dominic.
[46:50] And I don't know what God has spoken to
[46:52] you, but uh the Bible tells us of an
[46:56] account and a prophet of God referred to
[46:58] it where Philillip was sent from Samaria
[47:03] to go into the desert right in the midst
[47:07] of a big meeting and he left and he was
[47:10] reading the prophet Isaiah, the unic
[47:13] from Ethiopia.
[47:15] And he was reading and I know you know
[47:17] the scripture well and the account well
[47:19] and this is in thou knowest all things
[47:21] in the message thou knowest all things.
[47:24] He said he he didn't understand what he
[47:26] was reading. The unic didn't understand
[47:28] what he was reading and God told
[47:30] Philillip go join yourself with him. And
[47:34] when he did, he spoke to him about
[47:36] Christ Jesus, baptized him in a little
[47:40] hole of water out there, and Philip
[47:43] never did return back to Samaria, as far
[47:45] as we know, or that the Bible gives
[47:48] reference. And the Holy Spirit caught
[47:49] him away. And the unic didn't see him no
[47:52] more. And the unic taken that message on
[47:55] down into Africa. Well, there you are.
[47:59] You see, God knows what to do. Many
[48:02] times we guess at it, but God knows just
[48:05] exactly what's right, doesn't he?
[48:09] &gt;&gt; We all agree with that. We're going to
[48:11] pray. I'll ask a brethren to come and
[48:14] we're going to pray with brother
[48:15] Dominic,
[48:18] lay hands on him,
[48:21] and uh we can't impart anything to him,
[48:25] but we can ask God's blessings
[48:28] upon what God's intended.
[48:31] Heavenly Father, as this congregation
[48:34] views and is a witness, and those that
[48:37] are streaming are a witness, we are
[48:40] laying our hands upon our brother
[48:41] Dominic Sangamina. We're laying our
[48:44] hands upon him, oh God, because we
[48:46] believe that he did hear the name St.
[48:49] Jerome. And we don't know what what your
[48:52] intent is, but you know,
[48:54] &gt;&gt; we can guess at it, but you're not
[48:56] guessing at it. We can make a certain
[48:59] plan, but you're the one we ask to go
[49:01] ahead. Go before him. Lord, speak to
[49:04] whatever heart you have. And I pray,
[49:07] Father, in the name of Jesus Christ,
[49:09] that he will be there until you are
[49:12] finished. Oh God, there might be one
[49:14] soul. There might be more. We do not
[49:16] know. There may be be believers there
[49:19] that need to be encouraged. We do not
[49:21] know. But you know, thou knowest all
[49:25] things. and into your hands do we commit
[49:28] our brother and Lord Father I pray that
[49:31] your Holy Spirit will give speech to his
[49:35] lips. We pray oh God you will give
[49:37] thoughts to his mind and bypass the
[49:40] human element. We pray and may it be a
[49:43] direct contact with the people. Pray
[49:46] father that if you shall lead him and
[49:47] open doors to Ethiopia as brother Bus
[49:51] has already been there and the brethren
[49:53] from Kenya and brethren from Uganda. I
[49:56] pray oh God in the name of Jesus Christ
[50:00] that you will use not only one, use two,
[50:03] not only two, use three, use more, use
[50:06] our brother. I pray and as you lay your
[50:10] hand upon brother Dominic, we only lay
[50:13] our hands, oh God, upon him,
[50:15] acknowledging and believing that by the
[50:19] Holy Spirit, you will accomplish your
[50:21] work. And we say, "Let thy kingdom come
[50:25] in Jesus Christ's name." Blessings upon
[50:28] him and safety, I pray. and for his
[50:30] wife, oh God, sister Astrid, and the
[50:33] children. I pray, oh God, you'll watch
[50:35] over them and you'll provide for them.
[50:39] You'll give peace of mind and peace of
[50:41] soul in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen
[50:46] and amen.
[50:47] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[50:49] &gt;&gt; God bless you, my brother Dominic. God
[50:51] bless you. Bless you.
[51:01] What's that course I wondered about the
[51:03] Bible?
[51:05] Yeah. Word of God ever true.
[51:11] God bless you, brother Dominic and
[51:13] Sister Astrid. We pray that God will
[51:16] ever be with you. And we also want to
[51:19] remember uh the Roach family. Uh, Sister
[51:24] Glattis wrote passed away on Friday
[51:27] morning
[51:28] and my wife and I on yesterday
[51:32] ran into several of them in the White
[51:35] Rock area, the daughter Paula and her
[51:38] husband. Uh, her husband is a deacon at
[51:42] brother Tim Dodd's former church and we
[51:46] uh feel very close to them. uh brother
[51:49] Tom Ray was ministering up in Quinnel,
[51:52] British Columbia when they came to the
[51:54] knowledge of Jesus Christ in the light
[51:56] of this message. So we want to be
[51:59] remembering them and their family. We
[52:01] also we had an encounter with them which
[52:04] we don't believe was accidental. We
[52:06] nothing happens by accident. We hadn't
[52:07] planned to go where we were going and we
[52:10] were walking and we came right upon
[52:11] them. In fact, as we passed them and I
[52:15] said to my wife, I said, "That looks
[52:16] like Paula, but I wasn't sure." And so,
[52:19] we came upon them a second time when we
[52:22] changed our direction. We came upon them
[52:24] the second time, walking where we don't
[52:27] usually walk. And uh and then we saw it
[52:30] was Paula and her father and her brother
[52:34] who has just arrived from Chile had just
[52:36] arrived. I I don't believe he's a
[52:39] believer, but we he was a very fine
[52:42] young man. And we we had a time to speak
[52:46] together and share some things. And when
[52:48] we walked away, we knew that it wasn't a
[52:51] per chance happening. It was God
[52:54] ordained.
[52:55] &gt;&gt; Amen. And amen. I was going to tell you
[52:59] also
[53:00] uh I I did mention it Wednesday. It
[53:03] happened on It happened on Tuesday this
[53:06] last week when our phone rang and my
[53:10] wife answered the phone and while she
[53:12] was on the phone, the other line rang
[53:15] and uh she put her hand over the speaker
[53:19] and said, you know, would you go and get
[53:21] it? and I ran to her office to get the
[53:24] phone and I didn't reach it in time. And
[53:29] uh it it wasn't uh there was no one
[53:32] there. So [clears throat] when I came
[53:34] back out to the kitchen, I said, "Look
[53:37] on the LCD and see what what that number
[53:39] was." And so she said, "This is the
[53:41] number." And I wrote it down. And then I
[53:44] went into my office because I was
[53:46] studying. And I started studying. And
[53:48] then I thought I should call these
[53:50] people or call I don't know who it is
[53:52] but first I would go on the I would just
[53:54] Google the number and see what part of
[53:56] the world it was and it was in Buford,
[54:00] South Carolina.
[54:02] And so uh
[54:05] I thought well some of our one one of
[54:08] our families are down there. Brother
[54:09] Gary and Sister Lisa St. John are there.
[54:11] Maybe it's them. It might be brother
[54:13] Jason Watkins who's a pastor in the
[54:15] church there. It might be him. So, I
[54:18] dialed the number and a sister was on
[54:20] the phone and I just let my wife uh
[54:23] speak to her for a moment or two and
[54:25] then uh she handed the phone back
[54:27] [clears throat] to me. And I had I had
[54:29] prayed for this uh woman's husband about
[54:32] a year year and a half ago and I'll just
[54:35] give you a couple more details. I take
[54:37] time to tell you and and he had had an
[54:41] experience where uh he became very had a
[54:44] great a lot of pain in his elbow. So he
[54:48] went to the doctor just to see about it.
[54:51] And then after they did some tests and
[54:53] so on, he came back home and then he got
[54:56] a call at home and say, "Come right back
[54:58] to the office." And they came back to
[55:01] the doctor's office and they told him,
[55:02] "You have cancer and it's in the bones."
[55:05] And they didn't give him much hope. And
[55:07] I spoke with him. We spoke together and
[55:10] then we had prayer. And uh I hadn't
[55:13] heard from them since. And this was the
[55:15] man. And she said he had a turnaround
[55:19] and uh she said he was doing so well.
[55:22] And that's maybe a year or more ago. And
[55:25] then she said just recently he just uh
[55:28] he he had he he really had a downturn
[55:31] just recently. And I said well can I
[55:34] pray with him? And she said I don't know
[55:35] if he's strong enough. And she said but
[55:38] how did you how did you get our number?
[55:41] I said you called us. She said we didn't
[55:44] call. I said, 'Well, your number came up
[55:47] on the LCD.' And we wrote the number
[55:50] down. She says, "Uh, we we didn't call.
[55:52] It must have been an accident."
[55:56] Well,
[55:57] uh, I like those kind of accidents.
[56:01] And so, we were able to have prayer
[56:02] together. This is all in the last two,
[56:04] three weeks, we've had no less than
[56:06] three supernatural encounters.
[56:09] &gt;&gt; Isn't that our God?
[56:11] &gt;&gt; We shouldn't be surprised with those
[56:13] kind of things. We just say, "Pour it
[56:15] on, Lord.
[56:16] &gt;&gt; Let's have more of it."
[56:18] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[56:19] &gt;&gt; I'll have you stand with me and we'll
[56:21] have we'll have prayer just before we go
[56:23] to the scripture. And I'd like to sing
[56:25] that chorus, Word of God, Ever True.
[56:39] Changing [music] me.
[56:41] Changing you.
[56:44] We [music] have come with open heart.

[57:59] Calvary. We claim the Holy Spirit that
[58:02] filled [music] the church on the day of
[58:05] Pentecost. We claim, oh God, the message
[58:08] of the [music] hour that you have given
[58:09] us. We claim that the prophecies which
[58:12] you have spoken, so many many of them
[58:14] have been fulfilled.
[58:16] &gt;&gt; Give us receiving hearts today. Oh God,
[58:19] remove every barrier by the power of the
[58:22] Holy Spirit of God. And father, we pray
[58:25] that your thoughts, not man's thoughts,
[58:28] your [music] thoughts, your words
[58:31] inspired. And I give myself in total
[58:34] surrender to you, Father, that you might

[58:42] world. I pray that you will bless them,
[58:44] Father, whether they be in Switzerland
[58:46] or in Norway or in Europe and other
[58:48] places in Belgium. Oh God, in [music] in
[58:51] Africa, Father, we just pray you'll

[58:55] America. I pray you'll bless the people.
[58:57] Oh [music] God, however many are
[58:59] ordained to hear this service, [music]
[59:02] in the name of Jesus Christ, we ask it.
[59:05] Amen.
[59:08] I'll invite you to turn in your Bibles
[59:10] to First Peter, the Epistle
[59:14] of Peter,
[59:16] first chapter, and we'll read uh the
[59:18] first nine verses.
[59:41] Peter, an apostle of Jesus Christ to the
[59:44] strangers scattered throughout Pontis,
[59:47] Galatia,
[59:48] Capidosia,
[59:50] Asia, and Bethania,
[59:55] elect according to the fornowledge of
[59:57] God the Father, through sanctification
[1:00:01] of the SP, spirit under obedience and
[1:00:03] sprinkling of the blood of Jesus Christ.
[1:00:05] Grace unto you and peace be multiplied.
[1:00:09] Blessed be the God and Father of our
[1:00:11] Lord Jesus Christ, which according to
[1:00:13] his abundant mercy, hath begotten us
[1:00:16] again unto a lively hope by the
[1:00:19] resurrection of Jesus Christ from the
[1:00:21] dead, to an inheritance incorruptible
[1:00:24] and undefiled, and that fadeth not away,
[1:00:26] reserved in heaven for you, who are kept
[1:00:30] by the power of God through faith unto
[1:00:33] salvation,
[1:00:34] &gt;&gt; ready to be revealed in the last time,
[1:00:37] &gt;&gt; wherein you greatly Rejoice though now
[1:00:39] for a season if need be. You are in
[1:00:42] heaviness through manifold temptations
[1:00:45] that the trial of your faith being much
[1:00:48] more precious than of gold which
[1:00:50] perisheth, though it be tried with fire,
[1:00:53] might be found under praise and honor
[1:00:55] and glory at the appearing of Jesus
[1:00:58] Christ.
[1:01:00] Whom having not seen ye love, in whom
[1:01:03] though now ye see him not, yet believing
[1:01:07] ye rejoice with joy unspeakable and full
[1:01:09] of glory, receiving the end of your
[1:01:12] faith, even the salvation of your souls.
[1:01:16] I trust you follow those uh last words
[1:01:20] and I'm going to
[1:01:23] going to be dwelling on the seventh
[1:01:25] verse and I'll be putting it up on the
[1:01:29] screen in a few moments. God bless you
[1:01:31] as you have your seats.
[1:01:44] I'll just have you notice this scripture
[1:01:46] here
[1:01:48] first, please.
[1:01:51] that the trial of your faith
[1:01:55] being much more precious than gold that
[1:01:58] perisheth,
[1:01:59] though be tried with fire,
[1:02:02] might be found unto praise
[1:02:06] and honor and glory at the appearing of
[1:02:09] Jesus Christ.
[1:02:13] This is not the trial,
[1:02:16] not the trial being much more precious
[1:02:19] than that of gold. Everybody has trials,
[1:02:23] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:02:23] &gt;&gt; It's not just your trials. We have all
[1:02:26] kinds of human natural trials. It's not
[1:02:29] your trial that's more precious. We want
[1:02:32] to read the scripture, but the trial of
[1:02:35] your faith.
[1:02:37] &gt;&gt; And faith cometh by hearing and hearing
[1:02:39] by the word of God. It's the trial of
[1:02:42] your faith. If anything seeks to remove
[1:02:45] you from your faith,
[1:02:47] &gt;&gt; then God has given special special
[1:02:50] strength,
[1:02:51] &gt;&gt; special endurance
[1:02:53] &gt;&gt; to keep you through that
[1:02:55] &gt;&gt; and that shall not pre that shall not
[1:02:58] prevail.
[1:02:59] &gt;&gt; No weapon that's that's formed against
[1:03:02] you shall so the the testing of your
[1:03:06] faith in the revelation that God gave
[1:03:09] you. Now I will be speaking uh mainly
[1:03:13] upon that. So not the trial please note
[1:03:17] that down not the trial just the trial
[1:03:20] being more precious than gold but the
[1:03:23] trial of your faith. So I want to refer
[1:03:26] to some uh things we'll see now uh in
[1:03:31] this next the message of the anointed
[1:03:33] ones of the end time.
[1:03:36] What is faith? Brother Brenham asked
[1:03:38] that. What is faith? Faith is something
[1:03:42] that's revealed to you.
[1:03:45] That is not yet,
[1:03:47] &gt;&gt; but you believe it will be.
[1:03:50] &gt;&gt; The scripture says, "Faith is the
[1:03:52] substance of things hoped for."
[1:03:55] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:03:55] &gt;&gt; The evidence of things not seen. So
[1:03:59] that's that's not yet,
[1:04:02] &gt;&gt; but you believe it will be.
[1:04:04] &gt;&gt; Amen. And faith is a revelation
[1:04:07] of the will of God.
[1:04:09] &gt;&gt; Do you believe that?
[1:04:15] &gt;&gt; All right, I'll just leave the last
[1:04:17] slide for a few moments.
[1:04:22] Faith is not something mentally
[1:04:24] perceived.
[1:04:26] It's not something that we imagine.
[1:04:29] And he said, "Oh, if you could only get
[1:04:31] this,
[1:04:33] you'll see the greatest thing you've
[1:04:35] seen in years." As I studied and as we
[1:04:39] going to move through the service this
[1:04:40] morning, uh I thought of,
[1:04:44] you know, some some things and uh the
[1:04:46] scriptures full of principles. You know
[1:04:48] what a principle is? A principle is for
[1:04:51] example, fire is hot. It was hot
[1:04:53] yesterday. It was hot a thousand years
[1:04:56] ago. It'll be hot tomorrow. It'll be hot
[1:04:59] next year. In the springtime,
[1:05:02] uh plant life and botney life comes up
[1:05:05] at the warming of the sun and drawing
[1:05:08] the earth close. The earth becomes
[1:05:10] closer to it in its orbit. Uh uh in the
[1:05:14] spring, things come up. In the fall,
[1:05:16] things turn color and uh and uh and and
[1:05:19] and life goes back down into the roots
[1:05:23] so it won't be destroyed in the winter
[1:05:25] time. Those are principles. principles.
[1:05:28] Give and it shall be given to you.
[1:05:30] That's a law. God loves generosity. Give
[1:05:33] and it shall be given to you. That's a
[1:05:35] law. And there are even people who are
[1:05:37] not believers who are not Christians.
[1:05:39] They practice that law and and God
[1:05:42] honors that law.
[1:05:43] &gt;&gt; Uh faith is a principle. If if a person
[1:05:46] believes and there are people and
[1:05:48] brother Brandham said there are people
[1:05:50] the godly sister will come up and she
[1:05:53] misses it and a and a maybe even just a
[1:05:56] street woman a prostitute or whatever a
[1:05:58] woman of the world will come up and she
[1:06:00] just gets it. She gets her healing or
[1:06:02] gets whatever she's asking God for
[1:06:04] because she believes
[1:06:05] &gt;&gt; and that's a principle. So this is also
[1:06:09] a principle that the trying of your
[1:06:12] faith is more precious than gold.
[1:06:16] We don't we want to be careful. We don't
[1:06:19] whine or complain about it.
[1:06:24] Now
[1:06:26] uh in the in who is this Melzdc?
[1:06:30] The scripture, the prophet goes to the
[1:06:32] scripture, if this earthly body be
[1:06:35] dissolved,
[1:06:36] this earthly tabernacle, we have another
[1:06:39] one.
[1:06:41] See, he said we have we have bypassed
[1:06:44] that to come straight. In fact, is I
[1:06:47] have this on a on a slide, so I'll I'll
[1:06:50] have you read it with me. We have
[1:06:53] bypassed
[1:06:55] that and I have I've bolded I've made
[1:06:58] that bold because what we've bypassed is
[1:07:02] the scriptures Apostle Paul is talking
[1:07:04] about in first 2 Corinthians 5:1 if this
[1:07:08] earthly body be dissolved this earthly
[1:07:11] tabernacle he explains we have another
[1:07:13] one that's the one you bypassed
[1:07:17] &gt;&gt; we have another one
[1:07:19] &gt;&gt; you have a and prophet calls it a
[1:07:21] theophony body. We have another one
[1:07:24] &gt;&gt; that we go to
[1:07:27] &gt;&gt; as this body that you have today and you
[1:07:30] whatever condition you're in, but you
[1:07:32] have this body
[1:07:33] &gt;&gt; and it was formed and nurtured in the
[1:07:36] womb of your mother and you were issued
[1:07:38] into this world. And when you were
[1:07:40] issued into this world, you already had
[1:07:42] a body
[1:07:43] &gt;&gt; that was a little baby body that was
[1:07:45] received by your parents. and uh and and
[1:07:49] when we leave this life and the and the
[1:07:52] spirit that came into this body which
[1:07:54] gave it animation gave it life and
[1:07:56] movement when that breath is gone if you
[1:08:00] are a believer you will go to a
[1:08:02] believer's place
[1:08:03] &gt;&gt; Jesus said I go to prepare a place for
[1:08:06] you
[1:08:07] &gt;&gt; and you're not going to go there
[1:08:09] bodyless
[1:08:10] &gt;&gt; you're going to go there in another body
[1:08:12] and he said that's the one that you
[1:08:15] bypass that to come straight from God.
[1:08:19] &gt;&gt; The attribute, you're an attribute of
[1:08:22] God
[1:08:23] &gt;&gt; to be flesh.
[1:08:25] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:08:25] &gt;&gt; Not just to be flesh, but to be flesh,
[1:08:28] to be tempted
[1:08:30] &gt;&gt; and tested by sin like Adam did. But
[1:08:34] when the testing of his word is over,
[1:08:37] then we are taken up to this body,
[1:08:40] &gt;&gt; this other body
[1:08:42] &gt;&gt; that was prepared for us before the
[1:08:45] foundation of the world. Amen.
[1:08:47] &gt;&gt; It is the word that it is the word there
[1:08:51] that we skipped
[1:08:53] &gt;&gt; to come straight around down here to be
[1:08:57] tempted and tested. So it is the word
[1:09:00] that is being tested. It's God's word
[1:09:02] that is being tested. And this is where
[1:09:05] I want to uh I want I want to look at
[1:09:09] three junctions of time
[1:09:13] and two individuals specifically. And
[1:09:16] they're strange. You probably never ever
[1:09:18] heard of these two individuals being uh
[1:09:22] uh gathered in one service in one
[1:09:24] sermon. I want to speak about Abraham.
[1:09:27] And you've heard hundreds of messages on
[1:09:29] Abraham. And the other one I want to
[1:09:32] refer to as Mary Magdalene.
[1:09:35] And perhaps some of you hardly know
[1:09:37] anything about her. So I looked back and
[1:09:40] found exactly where she was first
[1:09:43] mentioned in the scripture and how her
[1:09:46] life went until she stands outside of
[1:09:49] the tomb and comes to the sephilar of
[1:09:52] Jesus. And there's very very much
[1:09:55] similarities. That was a great junction
[1:09:58] of time. the resurrection of Jesus
[1:10:00] Christ. It was a great junction of time
[1:10:03] when Abraham, the first man that
[1:10:06] received promise from God of another
[1:10:09] seed.
[1:10:09] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:10:10] &gt;&gt; First man, listen folks, first man from
[1:10:13] the fall of Adam, the first man to
[1:10:16] receive promise, that kind of promise of
[1:10:19] a seed
[1:10:20] &gt;&gt; that will become a people.
[1:10:22] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:10:23] &gt;&gt; And have an inheritance and have a land.
[1:10:26] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:10:26] &gt;&gt; And become a nation.
[1:10:28] that that man Abraham and and we want to
[1:10:32] see his life. And there's a here's
[1:10:35] here's the similarity between the two.
[1:10:37] Now, you might think I'm way out there,
[1:10:39] but I'll try to bring you into the
[1:10:42] scene. Both of these individuals,
[1:10:46] Abraham
[1:10:48] was without a child. And so, he was
[1:10:51] waiting, waiting, waiting. And I don't
[1:10:54] want to labor on it because I want to go
[1:10:56] into it a little later. But he's
[1:10:57] waiting, waiting, waiting for the sun.
[1:11:00] Mary Magdalene along with others, but I
[1:11:03] want to focus on her. She was waiting,
[1:11:06] waiting, waiting for as a nation was
[1:11:09] waiting for a messiah, for the Christ,
[1:11:13] for you know the Messiah is going to
[1:11:15] come. Waiting, waiting, waiting. And
[1:11:17] then the son came. Abraham got the son
[1:11:22] and she, the Messiah found her. She
[1:11:26] found the Messiah. They crossed paths
[1:11:28] and she became a believer. And I don't
[1:11:31] know, I can tell you, I don't know
[1:11:33] exactly what joy filled Abraham's heart,
[1:11:36] but he looked for that son for 25 years.
[1:11:39] Now he had the son. I don't know how
[1:11:41] long she looked for a Messiah to come,
[1:11:42] but he came and now now she has the
[1:11:45] Messiah. And she she becomes a follower
[1:11:47] of and and Abraham, his son, is is
[1:11:50] growing getting older and into his uh
[1:11:53] youth. And uh and then God calls
[1:11:56] Abraham, "Give him away. I'm going to
[1:11:59] take him away. Go up in this mountain
[1:12:01] that I'm going to tell you and slay your
[1:12:04] son."
[1:12:07] &gt;&gt; And Mary Magdalene, she wasn't called on
[1:12:10] to do that exactly, but God took the son
[1:12:13] away.
[1:12:16] and she comes to the sephilar
[1:12:20] and says, "Where have you taken him
[1:12:23] that I might go to him?"
[1:12:26] I want to refer to this as the assay
[1:12:31] test
[1:12:33] and it will cover I think everybody's
[1:12:35] life somewhere along the line. It is the
[1:12:38] trial of their faith
[1:12:41] &gt;&gt; that was taking place here. And then I
[1:12:44] want to come to the body bride of Jesus
[1:12:46] Christ. In this day, we are not to think
[1:12:49] that everything is just going to come up
[1:12:51] roses and everything is just glorious
[1:12:53] and wonderful.
[1:12:55] There comes a time where you you just
[1:12:57] receive this word. You receive this
[1:12:59] revelation. You receive this message and
[1:13:01] God becomes so real. Oh, this is so
[1:13:03] wonderful. And then as time goes on, you
[1:13:07] everybody encounters someplace along the
[1:13:09] way. said, "I prayed.
[1:13:11] It didn't seem to go any further than
[1:13:13] the ceiling. Where is he?
[1:13:16] &gt;&gt; Did he hear me?
[1:13:18] &gt;&gt; Where where's all my friends? Where
[1:13:20] where's where's all this blessedness?
[1:13:22] Where's this wonderful the fellowship
[1:13:24] seems to nothing seems to register
[1:13:27] anymore?" Do you get my layout?
[1:13:30] &gt;&gt; Okay. This is where the message is going
[1:13:32] to go.
[1:13:34] And the Bible says, "And God spoke to
[1:13:37] Abraham,
[1:13:38] and he said,"I will certainly return
[1:13:41] unto thee according to the time of life,
[1:13:44] and lo Sarah, thy wife shall have a
[1:13:46] son." And Sarah heard it in the tent
[1:13:49] door which was behind him, and we've had
[1:13:51] a messenger this time, I sat on the
[1:13:54] platform myself. When brother Brandham
[1:13:56] referred to this very scripture and
[1:13:58] said, "I'll turn my back." He turned his
[1:14:01] back and looked up in the balcony, not
[1:14:03] the balcony, but up in the gable end of
[1:14:05] the hall in Port Al Burnernney, British
[1:14:08] Columbia, and and detailed a man that
[1:14:11] was paralyzed and wheeled around and he
[1:14:13] said, "Isn't that right, Mike?" And
[1:14:15] pointed down and Mike was sitting in
[1:14:16] about the third row. And I knew Mike and
[1:14:19] I knew the man that he was describing.
[1:14:21] And he tells where the man is. And he
[1:14:23] says he's in a place called Nanimo.
[1:14:28] Listen friends, you can't have that kind
[1:14:30] of indication without saying something
[1:14:33] supernatural is happening.
[1:14:35] &gt;&gt; There's something from another realm,
[1:14:37] another place, another world, another
[1:14:40] dimension. Say, call it whatever you
[1:14:43] want, but it's not of this earth. It
[1:14:45] didn't come out of a Bible school. It
[1:14:48] didn't come out of a out of uh in
[1:14:50] intellectual things. It doesn't come out
[1:14:52] of psychology. It's God.
[1:14:56] &gt;&gt; You believe that?
[1:15:01] &gt;&gt; And so the Bible says
[1:15:04] the Bible says this of the of the
[1:15:07] scripture. And it came to pass
[1:15:11] after these things.
[1:15:13] I'll read that scripture for you. And it
[1:15:17] came to pass after these things that God
[1:15:20] did tempt
[1:15:25] Abraham.
[1:15:27] And the word tempt is he was going to
[1:15:31] grind him.
[1:15:33] And this is the assay test. How many
[1:15:36] know what the word assay means?
[1:15:39] The assay perhaps you you know what it
[1:15:42] mean? You might know what it means. But
[1:15:44] in it's very very well known in the
[1:15:47] mining and in the medical industry they
[1:15:49] it's an analysis it's an analysis of of
[1:15:52] something and and it's it's a test in
[1:15:56] fact is they have today a a test a
[1:15:59] software test for for those of you that
[1:16:01] are techies for browsers and and the
[1:16:05] test is an acid one an acid 2 and an
[1:16:09] acid 3 and those three different
[1:16:11] softwares will check browsers and see uh
[1:16:15] how how they handle uh material coming
[1:16:19] over the internet. And that that is the
[1:16:22] acid test for a browser. And in fact is
[1:16:26] uh we don't need to get into it but
[1:16:28] that's actually where the term came from
[1:16:29] in the drug world acid because it was
[1:16:32] breaking them into another another
[1:16:35] dimension and and that's why they called
[1:16:38] the drugs that did that acid. But that's
[1:16:41] not really what it's about. We're in the
[1:16:43] true acid test.
[1:16:45] &gt;&gt; This is the true assay.
[1:16:47] &gt;&gt; This is the true assay. In the mining
[1:16:49] industry, they will take and they will
[1:16:50] take rock, big loads of rock and pour it
[1:16:54] down into a ball mill. And the ball mill
[1:16:57] will grind it and grind it and grind it.
[1:17:00] Not into little pieces,
[1:17:04] into powder.
[1:17:07] &gt;&gt; A powder about the texture of household
[1:17:09] flour.
[1:17:11] And once it's in ground into powder,
[1:17:14] there's nothing left. There's no
[1:17:16] evidence of what it was. And then they
[1:17:18] put it uh into a in onto maybe tables
[1:17:22] and trays and whatever more and and and
[1:17:25] mix it with some acids. And then the
[1:17:28] acids as they work in this powdered rock
[1:17:32] and then it begins to show whether it's
[1:17:34] gold, silver, copper, what quality it
[1:17:38] is, the purity of it or the impurity of
[1:17:42] it. And again, you have an acid test and
[1:17:45] that is the assay and that's what God is
[1:17:48] doing. Not that God without his profound
[1:17:51] and infinite knowledge doesn't know, but
[1:17:54] he's he's giving a man an opportunity.
[1:17:57] He speaks a promise to him. And the
[1:17:59] Bible says after these things.
[1:18:03] So here you'll be able to put yourself
[1:18:05] someplace after he was called.
[1:18:08] &gt;&gt; Yes,
[1:18:09] &gt;&gt; we can identify with that. after he'd
[1:18:12] been called by God to go out and to
[1:18:14] leave his country or to leave his his
[1:18:17] associates or to leave his peers or to
[1:18:19] leave his family whatever it was he was
[1:18:22] called of God and he Bible says and he
[1:18:24] went out
[1:18:25] &gt;&gt; he he left his comfort zone
[1:18:28] &gt;&gt; and God might be calling even your name
[1:18:30] today
[1:18:31] &gt;&gt; to perhaps leave a a comfort zone that
[1:18:34] we have after he had worshiped because
[1:18:36] he had worshiped this God he worshiped
[1:18:39] the true God after he had heard God's
[1:18:41] promise of a son in a land after going
[1:18:46] and doing battle to retrieve Lot uh from
[1:18:50] captivity.
[1:18:52] &gt;&gt; And it was after Lot and his servants
[1:18:54] and Abraham's servants had uh had uh
[1:18:58] trouble between them over the over the
[1:19:01] pasture land and the feeding of their
[1:19:03] cattle and their animals and so on. And
[1:19:06] Lot chose the the well-watered plains of
[1:19:10] Sodom. He chose that. And Abraham told
[1:19:13] him to his nephew, "Wherever you go, you
[1:19:16] make a choice. Wherever you go, I'll go
[1:19:18] the other direction." And so he chose
[1:19:20] the well-watered plains. And that's he
[1:19:22] went and lived in Sodom. It was after
[1:19:25] the struggle with that. And it was after
[1:19:27] then when they when the kings came and
[1:19:30] took Lot and had war and there was quite
[1:19:33] a number of kings. Abraham, he took the
[1:19:36] people from his own that had been raised
[1:19:38] in his own uh uh in his own tribe and
[1:19:43] went out after him and retrieved Lot. So
[1:19:46] the Bible says after these things, so
[1:19:47] I'm telling you what he went after.
[1:19:49] You've had your battles. You've had your
[1:19:51] victories. You've had your time of
[1:19:53] worship. You've heard God call. You've
[1:19:55] left your maybe your comfort zone and
[1:19:58] you've moved out and you've you you
[1:20:00] feel, well, I I'm following along. I
[1:20:02] worship God. I'm here in church. this
[1:20:04] morning and perhaps this was very
[1:20:06] different. And the Bible says, the Bible
[1:20:09] tells us after his victory with these
[1:20:12] war and kings, he he went and fought and
[1:20:15] he had victory and after victory Melzdc,
[1:20:18] king of Salem appeared. After meeting
[1:20:21] Melzdc
[1:20:23] &gt;&gt; and after meeting Elohim,
[1:20:26] &gt;&gt; HE MEETS GOD IN different forms
[1:20:28] &gt;&gt; and he meets Melzdc. And that is why it
[1:20:31] says that he looked for a city in the
[1:20:33] New Testament. He looked FOR A CITY
[1:20:35] WHOSE BUILDER and maker was God. And the
[1:20:38] prophet said HE SAW THE KING OF THAT
[1:20:40] CITY.
[1:20:41] &gt;&gt; And so HE WAS LOOKING FOR THE CITY. And
[1:20:43] John spoke about it AND SAID HE SAW THE
[1:20:46] NEW Jerusalem coming down. He thought HE
[1:20:48] THOUGHT THE CITY MUST BE ON EARTH AT
[1:20:50] THIS TIME CUZ I'VE MET THE KING OF that
[1:20:52] city. So he was looking FOR A CITY. SO
[1:20:55] IT'S AFTER ALL OF THESE THINGS. THESE
[1:20:57] ARE WONDERFUL REVELATIONS, FRIEND. THESE
[1:20:59] ARE WONDERFUL EXPERIENCES. YOU MIGHT
[1:21:01] HAVE HAD SOME wonderful experience and
[1:21:03] so I'M GOING TO COME EVEN AFTER THAT.
[1:21:06] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:21:07] &gt;&gt; Following that
[1:21:08] &gt;&gt; and it was after he met Melzdc after he
[1:21:11] met and the prophet said Abraham was
[1:21:13] looking for it and he professed that he
[1:21:15] was a pilgrim and a stranger for he
[1:21:17] looked for a city whose builder and
[1:21:19] maker was Guad. that prophet knowing
[1:21:22] that it was somewhere.
[1:21:24] &gt;&gt; John saw it coming down. But Abraham
[1:21:27] thought it must be on the earth right
[1:21:29] then. Why? Because he met Melzdc, the
[1:21:32] king of it, and he gave him tithe.
[1:21:35] &gt;&gt; Isn't that marvelous?
[1:21:37] &gt;&gt; And now I'm coming to I'm coming to a
[1:21:39] moment of his life that's after all of
[1:21:41] this.
[1:21:44] after the grief between Sarah and Hagar
[1:21:49] and listening to his wife and Sarah said
[1:21:52] because her womb was closed, take Sarah,
[1:21:55] take Hagar.
[1:21:57] And he took Hagar, an Egyptian maid.
[1:22:01] And
[1:22:03] we have a ongoing problem with Ishmael
[1:22:07] and his seed
[1:22:09] &gt;&gt; ever since. And then Sarah says Sarah
[1:22:13] said because now Ishmael is making
[1:22:15] mockery of Isaac when he was being
[1:22:18] weaned and and this is all after this.
[1:22:22] He's experienced all of these things.
[1:22:24] He's now he's got the son.
[1:22:26] &gt;&gt; The son has come. THE SON OF THE
[1:22:28] PROMISE. OH, THE GLORIOUS THINGS ARE
[1:22:32] HAPPENING. He's arrived and now there's
[1:22:35] trouble in the home and the family. It
[1:22:37] wasn't THE TRIAL OF THAT PROBLEM. wasn't
[1:22:40] the trial of LOT'S PROBLEM. IT WASN'T
[1:22:43] the trial at Lot being down in Sodom or
[1:22:46] the servants arguing over over the grass
[1:22:49] IN THE PASTURES. IT WASN'T THAT. THAT
[1:22:52] wasn't more precious than gold.
[1:22:55] &gt;&gt; THAT WAS JUST LIFE.
[1:22:57] &gt;&gt; Do you hear me, folks?
[1:22:59] &gt;&gt; THAT WAS JUST LIFE. IT WASN'T THAT THE
[1:23:01] FACT OF HIS JOB OR HE WAS DIDN'T HAVE A
[1:23:03] TRIAL OF NO money or too much money. He
[1:23:06] didn't have a problem OF A TRIAL. THOSE
[1:23:08] WEREN'T THE TRIALS. It was THE TRIAL OF
[1:23:11] GOD'S PROMISE. WHAT GOD SPOKE
[1:23:13] &gt;&gt; SAID, I'm going to give YOU THIS.
[1:23:15] &gt;&gt; WHAT ABOUT THE PROMISE? WE SHALL NOT ALL
[1:23:17] SLEEP,
[1:23:18] &gt;&gt; BUT WE SHALL BE CHANGED. WHAT ABOUT THAT
[1:23:20] PROMISE? SHOULDN'T THAT BE MORE PRECIOUS
[1:23:22] THAN GOLD? AND YET the world will KIND
[1:23:25] OF EMULSIFY, TRY TO, you know, to to uh
[1:23:30] make that weaken that somehow. AND THE
[1:23:33] PERSON BECOMES DISCOURAGED AND SAY,
[1:23:35] "WELL, DOES IT REALLY WE HEAR ALL THIS
[1:23:37] STUFF AND ALL THESE THINGS?" WHEN YOU
[1:23:38] HEAR THINGS THAT WILL TAKE AWAY FROM the
[1:23:41] ferveny of your faith in the promise OF
[1:23:44] GOD, YOU DENY THAT ONE.
[1:23:48] &gt;&gt; That's the one you deny. WE HAVE ALL
[1:23:50] KINDS OF PROBLEM. I HAD A FLAT TIRE IN
[1:23:52] THE CAR. JUST SAY, "PRAISE GOD. THE
[1:23:54] TOAST burnt this morning." SO, ANYWAY,
[1:23:56] WHAT'S the difference? Well, we ran out
[1:23:58] of this or we ran out of that or we had
[1:24:00] this kind of problem, THAT KIND OF
[1:24:02] PROBLEM. THAT'S JUST DAYTODAY THINGS.
[1:24:04] GOD GOD JUST EXPECTS US TO BULLDOZE
[1:24:07] THROUGH THAT STUFF.
[1:24:09] &gt;&gt; That's not worthy of of of affecting our
[1:24:12] faith.
[1:24:14] &gt;&gt; And and SO YOU WON'T FORGET AFTER this
[1:24:16] service. YOU WON'T FORGET IT WAS AFTER
[1:24:18] THIS AFTER HE WAS CALLED, AFTER HE WAS
[1:24:20] WORSHIPED, AFTER HE MET MELZDC, AFTER HE
[1:24:23] WAS AFTER HE HAD A BATTLE IN VICTORIES,
[1:24:26] AND AFTER HE MET ELOHIM, AND AFTER HE
[1:24:28] RECEIVED THE SON, AND AFTER ALL OF THESE
[1:24:30] THINGS HAPPENED,
[1:24:34] And Sarah saw the Egyptian
[1:24:37] son Ishmamail,
[1:24:40] the son of Hagar,
[1:24:42] mocking, and she says TO ABRAHAM, "CAST
[1:24:45] THIS BOND woman out."
[1:24:49] The son of the bond woman will not be
[1:24:52] part of the son of the free woman.
[1:24:55] &gt;&gt; And that's quoted IN THE NEW TESTAMENT.
[1:24:57] THAT'S PART OF YOUR BIBLE.
[1:24:59] &gt;&gt; SHE WAS QUOTING SCRIPTURE. SHE WAS
[1:25:02] ACTUALLY initiating scripture.
[1:25:06] &gt;&gt; AND PAUL, APOSTLE PAUL PICKS IT UP. SAYS
[1:25:08] THE THE the the bond woman and he
[1:25:11] likened it with Hagar refers to Sinai
[1:25:14] and the law. AND WE'RE NOT JUSTIFIED BY
[1:25:17] THE LAW. CAST THAT THING OFF. YOU GOT TO
[1:25:19] do this and do that and do SOMETHING
[1:25:21] ELSE. YOU'RE NOT SAVED BY THAT. We may
[1:25:24] have to do that, BUT WE DO IT BECAUSE
[1:25:26] THERE'S A LAW IN OUR HOME. THERE'S A
[1:25:28] LAW. My wife sits back there. I I
[1:25:30] RESPECT HER. I HONOR HER. NOT BECAUSE
[1:25:33] there's a law or anything written on the
[1:25:35] wall says you're married and you can't
[1:25:37] do this and no one else washes. Brother
[1:25:40] Bam says when he goes over says he
[1:25:42] doesn't worry. She doesn't grab him by
[1:25:43] the His wife doesn't grab him by the tie
[1:25:45] and don't you have anybody else, you
[1:25:47] know, wash your socks or something. He
[1:25:49] wouldn't do that. HE SAID I I love her.
[1:25:52] &gt;&gt; We love him.
[1:25:54] &gt;&gt; WE HAVE A CERTAIN LAW AND THE LAW IS A
[1:25:56] LAW OF LOVE. WE DON'T HAVE TO HAVE IT
[1:25:58] GROUND into us.
[1:26:00] &gt;&gt; So God wasn't trying to get Abraham to
[1:26:02] love him more. God was testing him to
[1:26:04] SEE WHAT HE WAS MADE OUT OF.
[1:26:09] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:26:10] &gt;&gt; HOW DO YOU KNOW? BUT WHAT THE TEST
[1:26:11] YOU'RE GOING THROUGH AND THE TRIAL
[1:26:12] YOU'RE GOING THROUGH ISN'T SOMETHING
[1:26:14] THAT GOD IS IS BUILDING YOU AND BUILDING
[1:26:17] A NATURE AND A CHARACTER IN YOU THAT
[1:26:19] WILL STAND THE TEST.
[1:26:23] LET'S NOT BE LAX, LUKEWARM,
[1:26:27] &gt;&gt; HALFHEARTED,
[1:26:28] &gt;&gt; SPINELESS PEOPLE OF THIS GENERATION.
[1:26:31] THIS WILL THIS THIS GENERATION WILL
[1:26:33] DEVELOP really weak people.
[1:26:36] &gt;&gt; We're not interested IN WEAKNESS. WE'RE
[1:26:38] INTERESTED IN THE STRENGTH THAT GOD
[1:26:40] GIVES.
[1:26:41] &gt;&gt; WE NEED TO BE BOLD, not weak. Amen.
[1:26:46] &gt;&gt; Friends, I'm I'm going to speak because
[1:26:48] I probably won't speak this again, but
[1:26:50] I'm going to take my time and and speak
[1:26:52] it. It was after all of these things
[1:26:56] &gt;&gt; that God did tempt
[1:26:58] and to attempt the you and it's only
[1:27:01] this only has a single meaning really in
[1:27:03] the Old Testament. Nasaw
[1:27:06] to test
[1:27:08] to try
[1:27:09] to prove
[1:27:11] to tempt to assay
[1:27:14] to put to the proof test. And my message
[1:27:18] this morning is a tried and proven
[1:27:22] faith.
[1:27:24] &gt;&gt; We're not here to just develop, you
[1:27:26] know, uh kind of a fellowship and we're
[1:27:29] going to have coffee in the in the They
[1:27:31] wanted to put a coffee where our stairs
[1:27:32] are. I said, "You're in the wrong place.
[1:27:35] We're not have Well, all the churches
[1:27:37] want a coffee bar, not this one.
[1:27:39] &gt;&gt; We're not here just to have coffee and
[1:27:41] to have some fellowship. We're here to
[1:27:43] hear the word of God. We're here to
[1:27:45] worship the Almighty God and we're here
[1:27:48] to GO OUT OF HERE DIFFERENT PEOPLE.
[1:27:54] &gt;&gt; But the final testing of Abraham's faith
[1:27:58] was not for the struggles of life and
[1:28:00] family, relationships, etc., etc., but
[1:28:03] rather that he continued to believe the
[1:28:06] promise of God
[1:28:07] &gt;&gt; in another season,
[1:28:10] &gt;&gt; in another form of the word.
[1:28:12] &gt;&gt; Amen. LISTEN FRIENDS BECAUSE EVEN I HAVE
[1:28:15] THE I have the prophet's words where he
[1:28:17] SAY SPOKE OF ABRAHAM WHEN Abraham took
[1:28:20] the son and after all of these things
[1:28:26] and it came to pass after these things
[1:28:30] &gt;&gt; that God did tempt Abraham.
[1:28:33] I wonder
[1:28:35] perhaps we might come to a place like
[1:28:38] that. WHY AM I preaching this? that when
[1:28:41] you come to a place where you think God
[1:28:44] has ground you out,
[1:28:47] this isn't a maybe a, you know, jump up
[1:28:50] and down and dance kind of a message,
[1:28:52] but I believe it's exactly one that we
[1:28:55] need.
[1:29:02] &gt;&gt; This age is so filled with,
[1:29:05] you know, how do you feel and the
[1:29:06] feelings God's not interested in how you
[1:29:09] feel. Right.
[1:29:12] &gt;&gt; Of course, we're to have joy unspeakable
[1:29:14] and full of glory, but it comes as a
[1:29:16] result of a certain thing. Let me carry
[1:29:18] on.
[1:29:19] &gt;&gt; And he said, and God said, and God did
[1:29:22] tempt Abraham and said unto him,
[1:29:23] Abraham.
[1:29:25] And he said, behold, here I am.
[1:29:31] And I want to ask this morning, and I
[1:29:32] had to write write it further down in my
[1:29:34] notes by hand. Is God calling your name
[1:29:39] &gt;&gt; today?
[1:29:41] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:29:42] &gt;&gt; And you say, "How do I know he's calling
[1:29:44] my name? I I I may not hear my name
[1:29:47] speaking Ed or Mary or Susie or someone
[1:29:52] else, Bill or someone else." No, it is
[1:29:55] when something is spoken
[1:29:58] &gt;&gt; and it's quickened to you inside. And it
[1:30:02] means more THAN JUST A CASUAL
[1:30:04] CONVERSATION. YEAH,
[1:30:05] &gt;&gt; I WAS IN CHURCH THIS MORNING AND THAT
[1:30:07] WAS MORE THAN JUST A SERMON TO ME.
[1:30:11] &gt;&gt; I HEARD SOMETHING RESOUNDING WITHIN.
[1:30:14] &gt;&gt; GOD'S calling your name.
[1:30:17] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:30:18] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:30:20] &gt;&gt; God knows your name.
[1:30:22] &gt;&gt; HE'S CALLING YOUR NAME.
[1:30:24] &gt;&gt; AND IT MIGHT MIGHT NOT BE JUST BECAUSE
[1:30:26] I'M MAKING VERY DIRECT PERSONAL, BUT GOD
[1:30:30] NEEDS TO CALL OUR NAME.
[1:30:32] &gt;&gt; HE HAS SOMETHING FOR US. HE WANTS TO SAY
[1:30:34] SOMETHING SPECIFIC.
[1:30:37] &gt;&gt; And then you want to answer the way
[1:30:40] Abraham did.
[1:30:41] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:30:42] &gt;&gt; Here am I.
[1:30:43] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:30:46] &gt;&gt; Yes, Lord.
[1:30:48] &gt;&gt; And he says, "Take your son to a certain
[1:30:51] mountain that I will show you,
[1:30:54] and there I will tell you this place."
[1:30:57] And he begins to follow.
[1:31:00] And he knows that he's supposed to offer
[1:31:02] his son.
[1:31:05] And God is very specific. Says, "Your
[1:31:07] son, your only son."
[1:31:09] &gt;&gt; God was not required regarding Ishmamail
[1:31:11] in this in this project.
[1:31:14] &gt;&gt; This your son, your only son.
[1:31:17] &gt;&gt; That was the son of promise.
[1:31:19] &gt;&gt; That was not the son of product of the
[1:31:21] flesh.
[1:31:23] &gt;&gt; In fact, this it wasn't just a a sexual
[1:31:26] relationship
[1:31:27] because they were long past that.
[1:31:30] IT WAS HOPELESS. IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE.
[1:31:34] &gt;&gt; BUT GOD CAUSED IT.
[1:31:36] &gt;&gt; AND SO IN A DEAD BODY,
[1:31:38] &gt;&gt; AND THAT'S WHAT AND THE PROPHET brings
[1:31:39] that out. And I want to bring it out to
[1:31:41] you today that God God allowed him to
[1:31:43] see to test his faith even though the
[1:31:46] son had come from a body that was dead
[1:31:50] &gt;&gt; and into a womb that was dead.
[1:31:52] &gt;&gt; And he regarded that God HAD GIVEN LIFE
[1:31:56] &gt;&gt; OUT OF DEATH.
[1:31:58] AND HE RAISED HIS BLADE IN HIS KNIFE AND
[1:32:01] WAS READY TO THRUST IT INTO THE BOSOM OF
[1:32:04] HIS SON WHEN GOD THEN HELD HIM BACK AND
[1:32:08] SAID, "Do not hurt THE SON. DO NOT DO
[1:32:12] THAT." AND THEN GOD SAW IN IN in
[1:32:16] Abraham's faith
[1:32:18] &gt;&gt; that Abraham was believing that
[1:32:21] &gt;&gt; if IF I DO TAKE HIS LIFE, GOD WHO GAVE
[1:32:24] HIM FROM DEATH IN THE FIRST PLACE RAISED
[1:32:26] HIM UP AND gave him a resurrection.
[1:32:29] &gt;&gt; HIS FAITH, FRIENDS, WAS IN THE
[1:32:31] RESURRECTION.
[1:32:34] &gt;&gt; HE SAW HIM RESURRECTED
[1:32:36] &gt;&gt; BECAUSE HE'D ALREADY GIVEN HIM FROM
[1:32:38] DEATH.
[1:32:39] &gt;&gt; AND HE HAS CALLED YOU FROM DEATH. YES.
[1:32:42] &gt;&gt; HE'S CALLED YOU FROM DEATH.
[1:32:44] &gt;&gt; HE CALLED YOU OUT OF DEATH.
[1:32:47] &gt;&gt; WHY WOULDN'T HE GIVE YOU ANOTHER
[1:32:48] RESURRECTION?
[1:32:49] &gt;&gt; HE'S GIVEN YOU A RESURRECTION NOW.
[1:32:52] &gt;&gt; THIS BODY IS NOT GOING TO STOP THAT
[1:32:54] LIFE.
[1:32:56] &gt;&gt; HE'S ALREADY GIVEN YOU A RESURRECTION.
[1:32:59] &gt;&gt; SURELY HE WILL RESURRECT THIS THIS BODY.
[1:33:01] WHAT IS THIS BODY? IT'S JUST A CERTAIN
[1:33:03] AMOUNT OF CHEMICALS THAT COULD BE GROUND
[1:33:06] UP TO POWDER. SURELY HE WILL GATHER THAT
[1:33:08] TOGETHER and all the atoms and whatever
[1:33:11] made THIS BODY AND GATHER IT BACK
[1:33:13] TOGETHER. THAT'S OUR PROMISE.
[1:33:19] &gt;&gt; And Abraham, we are children of Abraham.
[1:33:21] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:33:22] &gt;&gt; So we can see what he had the experience
[1:33:25] that he had. Glory.
[1:33:26] &gt;&gt; And as they as he's going with the son,
[1:33:30] this was the assay test in the in the
[1:33:33] message victory day.
[1:33:35] &gt;&gt; Prophet said, "So he got up there and
[1:33:38] tied his hands and laid him upon the
[1:33:40] altar like that." Little Isaac never
[1:33:44] murmured
[1:33:45] &gt;&gt; because he was a type of Christ.
[1:33:49] &gt;&gt; Obedient. See the type of Christ. And he
[1:33:52] says, "And then when he pulled the knife
[1:33:54] from his scab, it scabbard and pulled
[1:33:57] his hair back
[1:33:59] &gt;&gt; out of his face to take his life." That
[1:34:02] was Abraham's
[1:34:03] &gt;&gt; Vday.
[1:34:04] &gt;&gt; Oh my. When he tested to that VERY LIMIT
[1:34:08] &gt;&gt; OF HIS ONLY SON.
[1:34:11] &gt;&gt; He said, notice Vday, Abraham's Vday was
[1:34:14] on Mount Jeriah.
[1:34:16] &gt;&gt; It was Mount Mariah, but his Jeriah's
[1:34:19] the God will provide. Jehovah Gyra, God
[1:34:23] will provide. And the prophet, I love
[1:34:26] that where he said it was on Mount
[1:34:27] Jeriah where God will provide. He knew
[1:34:31] that God would give it even even
[1:34:33] Abraham, even the son Isaac ON THE WAY
[1:34:36] UP. ISAAC and it was one of my first
[1:34:38] messages when I started in the ministry
[1:34:40] YEARS AGO SAID, "BEHOLD THE FIRE and the
[1:34:43] wood.
[1:34:45] &gt;&gt; Behold the instruments. BEHOLD THE
[1:34:47] ACCESSORIES.
[1:34:49] &gt;&gt; BEHOLD THE MUSIC. BEHOLD THE PEWS.
[1:34:52] BEHOLD THE SOUND. BEHOLD THE LIGHTS.
[1:34:54] BEHOLD ALL OF THESE THINGS. BEHOLD THE
[1:34:57] PREACHERS and the ministry.
[1:35:00] WHERE'S THERE'S THE FIRE AND THE WOOD.
[1:35:02] But where's the lamb?
[1:35:05] &gt;&gt; WHERE'S THE FOCUS? WHERE'S THE CENTRAL
[1:35:07] PART?
[1:35:08] &gt;&gt; WE HAVE CHURCH. WE HAVE WORSHIP. WE HAVE
[1:35:10] ALL KINDS OF WONDERFUL THINGS.
[1:35:14] ALL KINDS OF THINGS, ACCESSORIES,
[1:35:16] &gt;&gt; BUT WHERE'S THE LAMB?
[1:35:19] YEAH,
[1:35:21] &gt;&gt; we want AN HOUR SERVICE. WHY? BECAUSE
[1:35:23] IT'S A NECESSITY.
[1:35:25] &gt;&gt; We have water IN THE TANK AND BAPTISMS
[1:35:27] AND WE HAVE PEOPLE THAT SPRINKLE AND
[1:35:30] PEOPLE THAT DO THIS AND GOD'S NOT
[1:35:32] INTERESTED IN ALL OF THOSE THINGS. HE
[1:35:34] ALREADY GAVE A PLAN. HE ALREADY gave a
[1:35:36] program. EVERYONE BAPTIZED IN THE IN THE
[1:35:39] SCRIPTURES BAPTIZED IN THE NAME OF JESUS
[1:35:41] CHRIST. AND THAT'S THE WAY THESE FOUR
[1:35:43] WILL BE BAPTIZED TODAY. WHY? NOT BECAUSE
[1:35:46] IT'S OUR IDEA. IT'S HIS IDEA.
[1:35:52] And so Isaac is Isaac is saying, "Behold
[1:35:56] the fire and the wood, but where's the
[1:35:59] lamb?
[1:36:01] &gt;&gt; Where's the central part?"
[1:36:03] &gt;&gt; AND FRIENDS, WE DON'T WANT TO JUST HAVE
[1:36:05] CHURCH.
[1:36:06] &gt;&gt; WE DON'T WANT TO JUST HAVE PREACHING. WE
[1:36:07] DON'T WANT TO HAVE SINGING and just
[1:36:09] praying. WE WANT TO HAVE CONTACT WITH
[1:36:11] GOD.
[1:36:13] WE WANT TO FEEL AND SENSE THAT HE'S
[1:36:15] BEING LIFTED UP and honored and the name
[1:36:18] of our Lord Jesus Christ is BEING LIFTED
[1:36:20] UP. WHERE'S THE LAMB? I'M A CHRISTIAN. I
[1:36:23] DRESS RIGHT. I SPEAK RIGHT. I DO ALL
[1:36:25] THESE THINGS. BUT YOU WANT TO MAKE SURE
[1:36:26] THE LAMB IS present
[1:36:28] &gt;&gt; and the lamb is being projected.
[1:36:34] &gt;&gt; So in that day, Abraham proved to God
[1:36:36] without a shadow of a doubt his loyalty
[1:36:38] in Abraham proved to God his faith in
[1:36:40] him. For he said, "I got this boy when I
[1:36:43] was 100 years old by believing a
[1:36:45] promise, and he told me I was the father
[1:36:48] of nations. If he asked me to take his
[1:36:50] life, God is able to raise him up from
[1:36:53] the dead." Woo! My oh, what that ought
[1:36:58] to make a Presbyterian shout,
[1:37:01] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:37:02] &gt;&gt; God can raise him up again.
[1:37:05] &gt;&gt; And it came to pass after all of these
[1:37:07] things,
[1:37:08] &gt;&gt; and Abraham said, "Behold, I am." And
[1:37:10] Isaac spake unto Abraham his father. And
[1:37:13] said, "My father." And he said, "Here am
[1:37:15] I, my son."
[1:37:19] And he said, "Behold the fire and the
[1:37:20] wood." But where is the lamb for a burnt
[1:37:24] offering? And Abraham said, "My son,
[1:37:28] God will provide himself a lamb for a
[1:37:31] burnt offering." So they went went both
[1:37:34] of them together.
[1:37:41] And he said, "Lay," and God spoke when
[1:37:44] he raised his knife out of the scabbard,
[1:37:48] ready to plunge it into the boy's bosom,
[1:37:50] and he said, "Lay not thy hand upon the
[1:37:52] lad,
[1:37:53] &gt;&gt; neither do thou anything unto him. For
[1:37:57] now I know that thou fearest God,
[1:38:01] &gt;&gt; seeing thou hast not withheld thy son,
[1:38:03] thine only son, from me.
[1:38:08] Now I'm going to ask for your undivided
[1:38:10] attention.
[1:38:12] I have named this the piercing faith
[1:38:18] because he pierced through all the
[1:38:21] elements of the human life.
[1:38:25] He pierced through until he come. And
[1:38:29] friends, I'm not preaching at you.
[1:38:33] I thought very very seriously and even
[1:38:35] spoke to my wife. Sometimes we're called
[1:38:38] on to speak things that perhaps we
[1:38:41] haven't attained to yet.
[1:38:45] Perhaps I haven't attained to.
[1:38:48] But I'm standing here today thinking
[1:38:51] maybe there's somebody here that's going
[1:38:52] to.
[1:38:54] Maybe someone else is going to. Maybe
[1:38:56] one of you young men, one of you young
[1:38:57] ladies, one of your families, some of
[1:38:59] your brothers.
[1:39:01] that you're going to attain
[1:39:04] to this kind of faith. I pray that I
[1:39:07] will also
[1:39:10] but this kind of grinding
[1:39:13] not too many people survive it and not
[1:39:16] too many people are even entrusted with
[1:39:18] it and God crowned him down.
[1:39:22] He doesn't have a wife or family to
[1:39:25] support him then
[1:39:27] he's alone.
[1:39:29] He's alone with a young lad that he's
[1:39:31] going to take his life.
[1:39:33] A young lad that God gave him. And he
[1:39:35] waited FOR HIM. I WAITED FOR HIM 25
[1:39:38] YEARS AND YOU ASKED ME TO take his life.
[1:39:41] He wasn't whimpering.
[1:39:45] &gt;&gt; He wasn't complaining.
[1:39:49] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:39:53] &gt;&gt; God Abraham,
[1:39:56] here I am.
[1:39:58] Take your son, your only son.
[1:40:01] Take your entire life, everything that's
[1:40:03] wrapped, your life is wrapped up in
[1:40:06] &gt;&gt; and I want you to offer it. And he just
[1:40:10] ground him down till he came to full
[1:40:13] surrender.
[1:40:14] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:40:15] &gt;&gt; Full surrender.
[1:40:17] &gt;&gt; And he finally said, "God gave me
[1:40:22] what I have. God gave me what I am.
[1:40:28] And if God even asked me to give it all
[1:40:30] up and surrender,
[1:40:32] I would offer it to him because he can
[1:40:35] give me double portion. He can give me
[1:40:37] more if necessary.
[1:40:45] Lay not thy hand upon the son. Now I
[1:40:49] know that thou fearthst God. And I
[1:40:52] called it a piercing faith.
[1:40:54] Please hold your attention
[1:40:57] because I'm going to describe and show
[1:40:59] you in the scripture and actually show
[1:41:00] you in the Hebrew uh and the especially
[1:41:04] the Greek words, not so much in the
[1:41:06] Hebrew and the Old Testament, but then
[1:41:08] we get into the New Testament because
[1:41:10] now it's after the sacrifice of Jesus
[1:41:12] Christ. And the Bible tells us this.
[1:41:18] And others, it's speaking of those in
[1:41:20] Hebrews 11. And others
[1:41:24] had trial of cruel mockings and
[1:41:28] scourgings. Yay. Moreover, of bonds and
[1:41:32] imprisonment.
[1:41:33] The Bible tells us of those in Hebrews
[1:41:36] 11. And I guess perhaps I should just
[1:41:39] take a moment and read it for you.
[1:41:43] Uh,
[1:41:50] I have it here in my notes as well. I
[1:41:53] feel I just want to read it here now.
[1:42:00] And others had trial. Hold the word
[1:42:02] trial.
[1:42:04] Hebrews 11:36.
[1:42:06] of cruel mockings and scourgings, yay,
[1:42:09] moreover, of bonds and imprisonment.
[1:42:13] They were stoned. They were saw a
[1:42:15] sunder, were tempted, were slain with
[1:42:19] the sword. They wandered about in sheep
[1:42:22] skins and goat skins, being destitute,
[1:42:26] afflicted, tormented, of whom the world
[1:42:29] was not worthy. They wandered in deserts
[1:42:33] and in mountains and in dens and in
[1:42:36] caves of the earth. And all of these
[1:42:39] having obtained a good report.
[1:42:41] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:42:42] &gt;&gt; A good report
[1:42:44] &gt;&gt; through faith.
[1:42:45] &gt;&gt; Yes,
[1:42:47] &gt;&gt; because they didn't lose their faith in
[1:42:49] all of these things
[1:42:51] &gt;&gt; through faith and received not the
[1:42:53] promise. God having provided some better
[1:42:56] thing for us that they without us should
[1:43:00] not be made perfect or be made complete.
[1:43:03] &gt;&gt; And the trial there is a a trying or
[1:43:06] approving that which something is tried
[1:43:09] or proven. It is an experience a trial
[1:43:13] approved by and tried character.
[1:43:17] &gt;&gt; A proof of tried worth
[1:43:20] &gt;&gt; to see what he's worth. See what
[1:43:23] Abraham's worth.
[1:43:25] &gt;&gt; He was worth when because God made him
[1:43:27] the father of nations.
[1:43:30] &gt;&gt; Are you still with me?
[1:43:33] &gt;&gt; And then that comes from another word.
[1:43:35] It is tried
[1:43:37] ex to made to be made acceptable.
[1:43:41] &gt;&gt; And that is why the apostle Paul in
[1:43:43] writing Ephesians could say to the
[1:43:46] praise of the glory of his grace.
[1:43:48] Hallelujah.
[1:43:49] &gt;&gt; TO THE PRAISE OF THE GLORY OF HIS GRACE
[1:43:53] WHEREIN
[1:43:55] &gt;&gt; IN THAT HE HATH MADE US ACCEPTED IN THE
[1:43:58] BELOVED. AND THAT IS WHY THE PROPHET OF
[1:44:01] GOD IN THIS DAY COMES TO THAT SCRIPTURE
[1:44:04] &gt;&gt; BECAUSE NOW THE WORD OF GOD oh my uh you
[1:44:08] you just pray for me and pray for
[1:44:09] yourself.
[1:44:11] One of the scriptures that is used all
[1:44:14] the time through the prophet WHILE HE'S
[1:44:16] SPEAKING TO people for the word of GOD
[1:44:20] &gt;&gt; IS QUICK AND powerful
[1:44:23] &gt;&gt; and sharper than any TWO-EDGED SWORD.
[1:44:25] WHAT IS IT? The word of God.
[1:44:28] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:44:28] &gt;&gt; The word, the actual THUS SAYAITH THE
[1:44:31] LORD.
[1:44:32] &gt;&gt; NOT THUS SAITH the denomination or the
[1:44:35] church or the Bible school or the
[1:44:37] theologian. THUS SAITH THE LORD, THAT
[1:44:41] WORD IS QUICK AND POWERFUL and sharper
[1:44:44] than any two-edged sword. BY HEARING THE
[1:44:46] WORD, FAITH COMES INTO THE HEART. THEN
[1:44:48] GOD CAN TRY that faith and test that
[1:44:51] faith. But it says and and and uh the
[1:44:55] SHARPER THAN ANY TWO-EDGED SWORD
[1:44:57] piercing piercing
[1:45:00] piercing even to the dividing of sunder
[1:45:04] of soul AND SPIRIT NOT BODY and soul or
[1:45:07] body and spirit but soul and spirit.
[1:45:10] Amen.
[1:45:11] &gt;&gt; So that WE KNOW THAT THAT SOUL REALM,
[1:45:13] THAT SOLOULISH realm of all the emotions
[1:45:16] of of memory and imagination and
[1:45:19] conscience and affection. Oh my
[1:45:22] goodness. I tell you what, in this day,
[1:45:25] we certainly need the word of God to
[1:45:27] come and divide affection so people
[1:45:29] know, oh, that's just an affection of my
[1:45:32] emotional life. BUT THEN GOD GIVES A
[1:45:35] evidence of when when a person receives
[1:45:38] that's why I believe in in relationships
[1:45:40] between young men and young women. You
[1:45:42] can't get it on the internet friends.
[1:45:45] &gt;&gt; You cannot find it on the internet. HE
[1:45:47] DIDN'T SAY WHOSOEVER YOU FIND ON THE
[1:45:49] INTERNET. THAT IS NOT IT.
[1:45:52] &gt;&gt; You might as well say amen because that
[1:45:54] is the truth.
[1:45:57] that only that instrument just as to to
[1:46:00] excite A PERSON'S AFFECTIONS AND TWIST
[1:46:02] THE AFFECTIONS OFF OF THE RIGHT WAY.
[1:46:05] It's the word of God that divides
[1:46:07] between the soul and THE SPIRIT. IT'LL
[1:46:09] DIVIDE THAT STUFF off
[1:46:11] &gt;&gt; and AND BRING A PERSON INTO REALITY WITH
[1:46:15] someone who's a tested tried word son of
[1:46:19] God
[1:46:20] &gt;&gt; OR A TESTED TRIED DAUGHTER of God.
[1:46:25] Listen to me young people unmarried.
[1:46:27] That's who you want for a husband or
[1:46:29] wife.
[1:46:34] &gt;&gt; Not all of you said amen.
[1:46:37] &gt;&gt; That's who you want.
[1:46:40] &gt;&gt; You want to be able to see one who's
[1:46:42] gone through the mill,
[1:46:44] &gt;&gt; one who's lived a life, one who's not
[1:46:47] had everything come their way.
[1:46:49] &gt;&gt; You want to see one that's grounded in
[1:46:51] the word of God. You want to see
[1:46:53] somebody not not not nice eyes and nice
[1:46:57] this or nice that. That's not it. That's
[1:46:59] not it. It's one who has a developed a
[1:47:02] character
[1:47:05] &gt;&gt; from hearing the word of God.
[1:47:07] &gt;&gt; They've gone through thick and through
[1:47:08] thin.
[1:47:09] &gt;&gt; THEY'VE GONE THROUGH GOOD TIMES AND
[1:47:10] THEY'VE GONE THROUGH BAD times
[1:47:13] &gt;&gt; and still they remain steadfast. Okay.
[1:47:25] And now
[1:47:29] here's a point that I I need to make.
[1:47:33] Says others had trial. And that trial
[1:47:38] that word is very very important for you
[1:47:40] to remember. I would like to have had it
[1:47:42] up on all on the board. That word trial
[1:47:46] is like a trial by assay.
[1:47:50] They said by mockings
[1:47:53] and scourgings
[1:47:55] and all kinds of difficulties,
[1:47:58] all kinds of things happen there. But
[1:48:01] this was an assay. And and furthermore,
[1:48:04] listen now, it's an assay, a trial
[1:48:07] experience to have a trial of a thing,
[1:48:09] to learn by experience. But it came from
[1:48:12] another word, a derivative of this word.
[1:48:15] And that word is to pierce. Because
[1:48:17] God's intention
[1:48:19] &gt;&gt; of these series of things was to take
[1:48:22] these people and give them a FAITH THAT
[1:48:24] WOULD ACTUALLY TRANSPORT THEM.
[1:48:29] &gt;&gt; YOU DON'T GET IT. TRANSPORT them
[1:48:32] &gt;&gt; from from this realm
[1:48:35] &gt;&gt; to an immortal realm.
[1:48:36] &gt;&gt; THEY ACTUALLY COULD SEE IT.
[1:48:38] &gt;&gt; THEY ACTUALLY COULD SEE THAT THIS WAS
[1:48:41] THIS WORLD IS IS NOT THIS WORLD IS NOT
[1:48:44] MY HOME. WE MAKE LITTLE PHRASES LIKE
[1:48:46] THAT, but it goes way way beyond that.
[1:48:51] &gt;&gt; Okay?
[1:48:54] &gt;&gt; And it goes further
[1:48:58] to pierce.
[1:49:00] &gt;&gt; For the word of God is quick and
[1:49:01] powerful, sharper than any two-edged
[1:49:04] sword.
[1:49:06] &gt;&gt; To pierce even between
[1:49:09] Why am I SAYING THESE THINGS? BECAUSE
[1:49:11] THIS MESSAGE,
[1:49:12] &gt;&gt; that's where a lot of people fall away.
[1:49:16] &gt;&gt; CUZ THIS IS NOT JUST a word that you
[1:49:18] heard in another church
[1:49:20] &gt;&gt; or something you read on the internet
[1:49:23] &gt;&gt; or or something you heard uh you heard.
[1:49:26] I like that preacher because he doesn't
[1:49:28] really, you know, it doesn't dig very
[1:49:30] deep. We want to have a preacher and
[1:49:33] preaching.
[1:49:34] &gt;&gt; As the prophet said, take the gloves
[1:49:36] off.
[1:49:38] &gt;&gt; That kind of preaching.
[1:49:40] Amen. And tell it THE WAY IT IS. BECAUSE
[1:49:42] FURTHERMORE, IT'S NOT JUST TO SPEAK
[1:49:44] ABOUT THOSE THINGS. That's not it. But
[1:49:46] it's to TELL YOU WHAT THE PURPOSE OF GOD
[1:49:48] IS
[1:49:49] &gt;&gt; BY PIERCING TO GIVE A PERSON THE FAITH.
[1:49:53] FAITH THAT EXTENDS BEYOND THE PIERCING
[1:49:56] BECAUSE WE KNOW THAT GOD WANTS to use
[1:49:58] this God WANTS TO USE THIS EXPERIENCE TO
[1:50:01] TRANSPORT US TO ANOTHER LEVEL.
[1:50:04] AND THAT IS WHY THAT WORD THE trial uh
[1:50:08] OTHERS HAD TRIAL. WHAT DID THEY HAVE?
[1:50:10] They had something THAT WOULD TAKE THEM
[1:50:13] BEYOND all of the natural elements. They
[1:50:16] had trial that would give them a faith
[1:50:19] that PIERCED BEYOND THIS LIFE when they
[1:50:23] had mockings and scourgings and
[1:50:26] imprisonment and death AND THEY THEY SAW
[1:50:29] BEYOND the mocking. Amen.
[1:50:33] &gt;&gt; We have mocking today.
[1:50:35] &gt;&gt; We have mocking today.
[1:50:38] &gt;&gt; We have mocking of this word today.
[1:50:40] &gt;&gt; I'm here to ask you, do you have faith
[1:50:43] that sees beyond that
[1:50:45] &gt;&gt; that that doesn't that doesn't that
[1:50:48] doesn't even register with you?
[1:50:50] &gt;&gt; WHY SHOULD WE BE CONCERNED ABOUT
[1:50:52] SOMETHING THAT GOD DOESN'T EVEN IT'S NOT
[1:50:54] EVEN IN GOD'S BOOK?
[1:50:56] &gt;&gt; IT'S NOT EVEN IN GOD'S MIND. AND THEY
[1:50:58] WENT BEYOND MOCKING. THEY WENT TO
[1:51:00] SCOURGING, PHYSICAL ABUSE, and they went
[1:51:04] beyond that. THEIR FAITH PIERCED BEYOND.
[1:51:09] &gt;&gt; And the next word it comes to to take
[1:51:11] you beyond.
[1:51:14] &gt;&gt; Isn't that marvelous? The word trial.
[1:51:17] &gt;&gt; Wasn't just an assay test. We don't stop
[1:51:20] there.
[1:51:21] &gt;&gt; But it is that the experience that you
[1:51:23] go through because of what you see
[1:51:26] penetrates penetrates all these things.
[1:51:29] moves aside the mocking, moves aside all
[1:51:32] the all all the uh uh speech and all the
[1:51:35] accusations. MOVES IT ALL ASIDE.
[1:51:38] PIERCES, PENETRATES, GOES BEYOND THAT.
[1:51:41] GOES BEYOND HARDSHIP. OH, BECAUSE YOU
[1:51:43] BELIEVE THAT YOU CAN'T HAVE THIS JOB.
[1:51:45] KEEP moving straight on. Doesn't matter.
[1:51:48] I don't get that job. UH MY MY
[1:51:50] CO-WORKERS, THEY SAY I I'M A FANATIC. I
[1:51:53] GO OUT OF THIS. It goes beyond that.
[1:51:55] JUST KEEPS PIERCING PIERCING. WHY
[1:51:58] PIERCING? BECAUSE GOD WANTS YOU TO HAVE
[1:52:00] THAT KIND OF FAITH. BECAUSE OF THE OTHER
[1:52:03] SIDE OF THE PIERCING, YOU REACH AN
[1:52:05] IMMORTAL STATE.
[1:52:12] &gt;&gt; LORD,
[1:52:12] &gt;&gt; isn't that what Apostle Paul says? Yes,
[1:52:15] &gt;&gt; we sorrow but not as others
[1:52:18] &gt;&gt; who have no hope
[1:52:19] &gt;&gt; BECAUSE THE FAITH THAT they have been
[1:52:22] received, the faith that they have
[1:52:24] received takes them beyond
[1:52:26] &gt;&gt; the natural element of death.
[1:52:30] &gt;&gt; Praise God.
[1:52:36] &gt;&gt; I just told this to brother Miguel the
[1:52:40] other day.
[1:52:42] I was right here in this town
[1:52:44] of Cloverdale
[1:52:46] and I was a young man
[1:52:49] with a young family
[1:52:52] and I had some kind of experience. Could
[1:52:54] have been a dream. It wasn't a dream
[1:52:56] because there's no picture. Dreams
[1:52:57] usually have pictures. My father was 64.
[1:53:01] He was very youthful. He only had a just
[1:53:04] a few sprinkling of gray hair. We were
[1:53:07] taken like brothers often.
[1:53:13] and my father was going to come up and
[1:53:14] help me build a house right over here in
[1:53:16] 180th Street that we lived in for over
[1:53:18] 20 about 24 years.
[1:53:22] I said, "I have to put some weeping tile
[1:53:24] around the basement and uh carpenters
[1:53:27] are there doing the framing. So, I need
[1:53:29] to get some material." But I said,
[1:53:31] "Could you come and help me with the
[1:53:32] weeping tile?" Yes. He was happy to do
[1:53:34] that. and he said, "I'll go and get
[1:53:36] Allan," which was my brother-in-law,
[1:53:39] "and uh I'll I'll see if he's free, and
[1:53:41] I'll come." And then I said, "Okay,
[1:53:43] Dad." Uh my last words to my father on
[1:53:46] earth was, "I'll see you in the
[1:53:47] morning."
[1:53:49] I just didn't know which morning it was.
[1:53:53] &gt;&gt; I just gave this testimony to brother
[1:53:55] McU.
[1:53:57] And that next that night in the morning,
[1:54:01] I woke up from the bed. I was convulsing
[1:54:05] in tears.
[1:54:06] I've never had my tears make the pillow
[1:54:09] wet in my life except that day. It was
[1:54:12] early in the morning
[1:54:15] and all I was the presence of death was
[1:54:17] there and it was as though my wife had
[1:54:21] died, my father had died, my sister had
[1:54:23] died and it I and I woke up and I
[1:54:26] thought this should be this kind of loss
[1:54:28] should affect me more. And in the next
[1:54:31] few moments, it just swept over me like
[1:54:34] a tsunami wave. And I just broke in two.
[1:54:38] And I began to sobb. And the bed was
[1:54:40] shaking. And my pillow was wet. And I
[1:54:44] awakened from where wherever what state
[1:54:47] I was in.
[1:54:49] And I thought that is anyway that's bad.
[1:54:51] I just, you know, you want to put that
[1:54:53] out of your mind. And we I was having
[1:54:56] breakfast. I told my wife, you know,
[1:54:58] this kind of thing that happened and we
[1:55:01] waited. Then I went up to the house and
[1:55:05] my dad didn't come for breakfast and
[1:55:07] went up to the house, got some materials
[1:55:10] for the men and my wife drove up the
[1:55:13] drive and she said, "Uh, Ed, I think you
[1:55:16] better come. Your father's been taken to
[1:55:18] the hospital to Vancouver General
[1:55:21] Hospital. He's unconscious."
[1:55:23] What happened? And he said, "Well, the
[1:55:25] the lady in the house found him in the
[1:55:26] apartment."
[1:55:28] And I said, "Well, he must have he must
[1:55:30] have hit his head. Those are my words."
[1:55:34] And she said, "Well, I don't know, but
[1:55:35] they've called from the hospital and
[1:55:36] they going to need his medical medical
[1:55:40] information."
[1:55:41] And I said, "Well, I'll go right down."
[1:55:44] So, I went right down, walked into the
[1:55:46] Vancouver General Emergency, and a
[1:55:49] doctor came up. He said, he was a doctor
[1:55:51] on staff. I said, "I'm the son of Mr.
[1:55:54] Fred Biscll."
[1:55:56] And I said, "I understand he's been
[1:55:57] brought here." I said, "What what
[1:56:00] happened to him?" He said, "We don't
[1:56:01] know, but we suspect it's a massive
[1:56:03] cerebral hemorrhage."
[1:56:06] And I said, "All right." You know, they
[1:56:08] said, "He's right here off to my right
[1:56:10] behind the curtain and it's a busy place
[1:56:13] as you know." And so I walk behind the
[1:56:15] curtain and my father's strong, healthy,
[1:56:19] very strong, breathing, [snorts] his
[1:56:22] chest heaving up and down. He's totally
[1:56:25] unconscious, but he had aged 20 years.
[1:56:28] He aged at least 20 years. And I took
[1:56:31] his hand
[1:56:34] and uh I held it.
[1:56:37] And uh words of the message, prophet's
[1:56:40] words tell me and we know from science
[1:56:44] that
[1:56:46] we have senses that contact this present
[1:56:48] world. Five senses.
[1:56:51] And I said, "Father,
[1:56:54] he can't feel me.
[1:56:58] He can't see me.
[1:57:02] the smell and taste that's not there and
[1:57:06] he can't hear me. And I just said, "God,
[1:57:10] where is he?
[1:57:12] Where is he?" Because he's not here in
[1:57:14] that sense. He's somewhere.
[1:57:20] And uh I left there. I came home to our
[1:57:25] little house, which was a old Bible way
[1:57:27] house. And uh the uh promise box was on
[1:57:32] the mantle in the living room. And I
[1:57:35] said I stood in front of that m that
[1:57:38] promise box and I said, "God, I don't
[1:57:40] answer. I don't ask you for easy
[1:57:43] answers,
[1:57:44] but I need something."
[1:57:46] So I took a promise, picked it up, said,
[1:57:50] "In my father's house
[1:57:53] are many mansions."
[1:57:56] I said, 'Is that what it is? And I put
[1:57:59] it back and I went and sat in the chair
[1:58:03] and the girls were running around
[1:58:06] and I heard my wife say, "Girls, I think
[1:58:08] you should come here. I think daddy
[1:58:10] wants to be alone."
[1:58:13] And I sat in that chair and without any
[1:58:16] other thought what I experienced in the
[1:58:19] morning a few hours earlier with the bed
[1:58:22] shaking and the convulsing I just broke
[1:58:26] into
[1:58:27] just like a whole heart and being
[1:58:29] spilled out and sobbed of course and it
[1:58:35] it just overwhelmed me. I won't dwell on
[1:58:38] that because I'll tell you what else
[1:58:40] happened than the grace of God without
[1:58:44] without even asking without any
[1:58:46] knowledge of it. I lost all sorrow.
[1:58:51] I lost all feeling it left me. I never
[1:58:55] cried or I never shed a tear from that
[1:58:58] day forward. He died a few days later
[1:59:01] after they did a brain operation.
[1:59:04] We had to ship him to be had to arrange
[1:59:07] a funeral. I never shed one tear. I went
[1:59:11] to the service. The preacher preached a
[1:59:13] service. I saw my father buried. And
[1:59:17] from that day to this day, such grace.
[1:59:19] My daughters got up and sang at his
[1:59:22] funeral. Friends, I'm not here as a
[1:59:25] preacher. I'm here to tell you, we've
[1:59:27] experienced a few things.
[1:59:29] &gt;&gt; I've experienced a measure of the grace
[1:59:31] of God. That is absolutely true.
[1:59:36] &gt;&gt; Absolutely true. And I would say that
[1:59:39] perhaps I had a little foretaste
[1:59:41] of faith that penetrates
[1:59:45] the bed, the unconscious state, the
[1:59:49] operation,
[1:59:51] all of this thing,
[1:59:53] &gt;&gt; the loss of of a loved one. What are you
[1:59:57] going to do without your father? And we
[2:00:00] were close as brothers. And it's just
[2:00:03] taken an instant arranging and getting
[2:00:06] all the family together and having the
[2:00:08] service and shipping the body and all
[2:00:11] that friends. I think the rest of the
[2:00:14] family, his family is Catholic and they
[2:00:18] were so filled with of course they would
[2:00:22] be but I think they thought that I was
[2:00:25] some kind of strange person because I
[2:00:28] didn't have the same affection or
[2:00:31] display of it. It was what was called
[2:00:33] grace.
[2:00:36] &gt;&gt; Grace.
[2:00:39] &gt;&gt; I didn't feel to bring that. I wasn't
[2:00:41] going to say that. I got to watch my
[2:00:44] time. Can I have a few more minutes?
[2:00:48] &gt;&gt; I would be I would be
[2:00:52] doing a you an injustice
[2:00:56] if I didn't come
[2:00:58] to my second person and I'll go quickly.
[2:01:02] Mary Magdalene.
[2:01:04] She appears in Luke the 8th chapter
[2:01:07] and immediately after it mentions her,
[2:01:09] Jesus tells the parable and speaks the
[2:01:12] message of the swer and the seed. So I
[2:01:15] want to say after for Mary after she had
[2:01:20] been healed and delivered of demon
[2:01:22] spirits, seven evil spirits. The Bible
[2:01:26] said healed. Can you imagine what this
[2:01:28] woman experienced? She's like any of you
[2:01:32] women here. She was delivered of demon
[2:01:35] powers
[2:01:36] &gt;&gt; and she was there when the great crowds
[2:01:39] were there. She was there
[2:01:42] and it was after the people had gathered
[2:01:44] the Bible says out of every city. She
[2:01:47] saw that she saw all the multitudes of
[2:01:49] the early ministry.
[2:01:51] She hear she could hear not by tape but
[2:01:54] she could hear by individual by being
[2:01:56] there of all of the first poll
[2:02:01] and the people. that would gather around
[2:02:04] and perhaps she did not realize when she
[2:02:07] heard about the good ground that she was
[2:02:09] actually the good ground he was speaking
[2:02:10] of.
[2:02:12] &gt;&gt; She perhaps was there the day when Jesus
[2:02:15] said when they said to Jesus, "Your
[2:02:17] mother and your brethren are here." And
[2:02:20] she said, and he said, "My mother and my
[2:02:23] brethren are these that hear the word of
[2:02:24] God and do it." That's in Luke the 8th
[2:02:27] chapter also where she's first
[2:02:29] mentioned.
[2:02:31] And then perhaps she was there when the
[2:02:33] crowd was there and the woman came
[2:02:35] through and she was looking because she
[2:02:37] the Bible says that she attended to
[2:02:40] Jesus. She and others attended to his
[2:02:43] needs and so on. And the Bible says and
[2:02:45] ministered to him. She may well have
[2:02:48] been there when when he turned around
[2:02:50] said, "Who touched me?"
[2:02:53] She saw these things. I'm giving you a
[2:02:56] bit of her life. She saw people perhaps
[2:02:59] like you. I'll refer to you. She saw the
[2:03:02] people. She'd been in the She's seen the
[2:03:04] great wonderful times around the altar
[2:03:06] service. You've seen it. You've seen
[2:03:08] people delivered. You There's people
[2:03:10] sitting here. You've seen their lives
[2:03:11] changed. You know, they've been changed.
[2:03:14] We've seen what happened at SFU. And
[2:03:16] we've seen these that have been
[2:03:18] baptized, 12, 13 of them out of the
[2:03:20] Simon Fraser University. And those of
[2:03:23] our own congregation have been uh in a
[2:03:27] lukewarm backsliden state. and God moves
[2:03:30] on them. Friends, we've seen that.
[2:03:33] &gt;&gt; What are we seeing? WE'RE SEEING THE
[2:03:34] LIVING JESUS CHRIST.
[2:03:36] &gt;&gt; I just wish I wish that God would give
[2:03:40] me and give you and give us time. I I
[2:03:44] just need to take a little bit of time
[2:03:46] &gt;&gt; if you don't mind, friends.
[2:03:48] &gt;&gt; She she saw all these things and she was
[2:03:52] perhaps there when the bread was
[2:03:53] multiplied. Give ye them to eat. They
[2:03:56] said, "We have no more but five loaves
[2:03:58] and two fishes except except they go and
[2:04:02] buy meat for all this people." But then
[2:04:05] I want to go quickly after she had seen
[2:04:08] all
[2:04:09] &gt;&gt; after she had MINISTERED TO JESUS
[2:04:11] CHRIST.
[2:04:12] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[2:04:13] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[2:04:15] &gt;&gt; NOT SOME FOLLOWER, NOT SOME MESSAGE
[2:04:17] BELIEVER. She actually MINISTERED TO THE
[2:04:20] CHRIST HIMSELF.
[2:04:22] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[2:04:25] and she sees the crucifixion
[2:04:29] and all the things that took place.
[2:04:33] And then here's where my message title
[2:04:35] actually came from.
[2:04:38] And the first day of the week cometh
[2:04:39] Mary.
[2:04:42] Mary Magdalene early
[2:04:45] when it was yet dark under the sele and
[2:04:48] seeth the stone taken away from the
[2:04:50] sephiler.
[2:04:52] Then she runth and comes to Simon Peter
[2:04:54] and the other disciple which happened to
[2:04:56] be John whom Jesus loved and saith unto
[2:04:59] him, they've taken away my Lord.
[2:05:04] They've taken away the Lord out of the
[2:05:05] sequel, and we know not where they have
[2:05:08] laid him. I want to go to John's report
[2:05:11] now of this. And as yet they knew not
[2:05:13] the the scripture.
[2:05:16] And the Bible says of her in John's
[2:05:19] gospel,
[2:05:21] "And then the disciples went again as
[2:05:24] yet they knew not the scripture that he
[2:05:26] must rise again from the dead. And then
[2:05:29] the disciples went away again to their
[2:05:32] own house. Peter and John came." Mary
[2:05:35] was there first and she sees the stone
[2:05:37] rolled away
[2:05:40] from the sephiler.
[2:05:41] And Mary stood without the sephiler
[2:05:44] weeping.
[2:05:46] Her emotions are stirred. She's weeping.
[2:05:48] And as she wept, she stooped down and
[2:05:51] looked into the sephiler and sees two
[2:05:54] angels. She doesn't run AWAY AND SAY, "I
[2:05:56] SAW TWO ANGELS. I HAD SUCH A WONDERFUL
[2:05:58] EXPERIENCE."
[2:06:00] Now her grief goes beyond seeing angels.
[2:06:07] sitting and one on the at the head and
[2:06:09] the other at the feet where the body of
[2:06:11] Jesus had laid. And they say unto her,
[2:06:13] "Woman, why weepest thou?
[2:06:17] Congregation of Cloverdale Bible way,
[2:06:20] please put yourself back here.
[2:06:24] &gt;&gt; Put yourself
[2:06:26] &gt;&gt; in this scene."
[2:06:28] &gt;&gt; And I have a reason for saying that.
[2:06:29] Amen.
[2:06:32] &gt;&gt; And they say unto her, "Well, why
[2:06:33] weepest THOU?" AND SHE SAID UNTO THEM,
[2:06:35] "Because
[2:06:37] they've taken away my Lord." She had
[2:06:40] WAITED FOR HIM, RECEIVED HIM, HAD ALL
[2:06:42] THE GLORY OF SEEING THESE MIRACLES AND
[2:06:46] MARVELOUS THINGS AND THE MESSAGE COMING
[2:06:49] AND HEARING WORDS THEY'VE NEVER HEARD
[2:06:51] BEFORE. DID YOU HEAR THAT? SURELY THIS
[2:06:54] IS THE CHRIST, THE SON OF GOD. OH,
[2:06:57] NOTHING COULD AFFECT THAT. And now
[2:07:02] &gt;&gt; he's gone.
[2:07:04] And he doesn't just disappear. He goes
[2:07:07] in degrees
[2:07:09] and they take him and bind him. Surely
[2:07:13] he's going to loosen these things.
[2:07:15] Surely he's going to overcome this
[2:07:17] difficulty. Then they accuse him. And
[2:07:20] all these accusers come in. SURELY GOD'S
[2:07:23] GOING TO SMITE THEM. But he doesn't.
[2:07:27] SURELY GOD'S GOING TO INTERVENE. THIS IS
[2:07:30] HIM. THIS IS THE MESSIAH. THIS IS THE
[2:07:31] CHRIST. I'VE HAD THE REVELATION.
[2:07:37] Now the death, the crucifixion,
[2:07:40] nothing happens. Nothing happens.
[2:07:43] Nothing happens. Everything they
[2:07:44] believed in IS DETERIORATING AND FALLING
[2:07:47] in ashes.
[2:07:48] &gt;&gt; Are you with me, friends?
[2:07:53] &gt;&gt; But she had a faith. Amen.
[2:07:58] &gt;&gt; Please get me. She had a faith that
[2:08:01] penetrated.
[2:08:03] &gt;&gt; Move that aside. I don't care what they
[2:08:05] say.
[2:08:06] &gt;&gt; I DON'T CARE WHAT KIND OF ACCUSATION.
[2:08:09] &gt;&gt; I DON'T CARE WHAT LIES THEY TELL ABOUT
[2:08:11] HIM.
[2:08:12] &gt;&gt; I HAD A REVELATION.
[2:08:14] &gt;&gt; AND HER FAITH WAS BEING TRIED.
[2:08:17] &gt;&gt; BUT HER FAITH WAS HOLDING STEADFAST.
[2:08:21] &gt;&gt; WHAT WAS IT? IT WAS A PENETRATING FAITH.
[2:08:24] IT WAS A PIERCING FAITH AND CARRIED HER
[2:08:27] OVER AND SHE WAS THE FIRST ONE.
[2:08:31] &gt;&gt; THE FIRST ONE TO HEAR JESUS speak
[2:08:37] &gt;&gt; an immortal body.
[2:08:41] &gt;&gt; Immortality
[2:08:43] speaking to a mortal the first one.
[2:08:46] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[2:08:48] &gt;&gt; What's he say? doesn't say to her,
[2:08:50] "You're a wonderful woman."
[2:08:52] Said, "Marry,
[2:08:55] &gt;&gt; right?
[2:08:56] &gt;&gt; That's all. Marry."
[2:09:08] &gt;&gt; He was standing there. She thought he
[2:09:09] was the gardener.
[2:09:12] &gt;&gt; He was standing there when she was
[2:09:14] talking talking TO THE ANGELS. SHE SAID,
[2:09:16] "THEY'VE TAKEN HIM AWAY."
[2:09:19] and she turns and sees him, SAYS, "TELL
[2:09:21] ME WHERE YOU'VE TAKEN HIM THAT I MIGHT
[2:09:23] go to him." [sighs and gasps]
[2:09:28] Friends, I'm talking about that's the
[2:09:30] kind of faith the believer has. That's
[2:09:33] the kind of faith this message produces.
[2:09:37] &gt;&gt; That's the kind of messages that you are
[2:09:39] hearing. That's where God intends you to
[2:09:42] go. THE FAITH THAT WILL PENETRATE THE
[2:09:45] 20TH CENTURY, THE 21ST CENTURY, ALL OF
[2:09:48] THE GIMMICKS AND THE GADGETS AND ALL OF
[2:09:50] THE SEXUALITY AND ALL OF THAT NONSENSE
[2:09:52] AND ALL OF THIS FILTH AND ALL OF THIS
[2:09:54] VILE GENERATION. YOUR FAITH WILL
[2:09:58] PENETRATE ALL OF THAT AND BRING YOU
[2:10:01] VICTORIOUS TO THE OTHER SIDE. THAT'S
[2:10:04] GOD'S PLAN.
[2:10:06] &gt;&gt; DON'T GET CAUGHT UP WITH THIS STUFF.
[2:10:09] &gt;&gt; DON'T GET CAUGHT UP WITH WHAT PEOPLE
[2:10:11] SAID. SHE NEVER REFERRED TO WHAT
[2:10:13] SOMEBODY SAID OR WHO SAID this or WHO
[2:10:15] SAID THAT. WHO GIVES A CARE WHO SAID
[2:10:18] WHAT?
[2:10:23] &gt;&gt; Listen friends, this is instruction. You
[2:10:26] won't hear it again from me.
[2:10:29] &gt;&gt; I tell you, in the name of the Lord,
[2:10:31] leave that stuff out.
[2:10:34] &gt;&gt; Set the DOOR ON IT.
[2:10:36] &gt;&gt; DON'T HAVE IT IN YOUR HOUSE.
[2:10:40] It'll only take you down. I'm pointing
[2:10:42] it to two people that refuse to let it
[2:10:45] affect them.
[2:10:47] &gt;&gt; He said, "WE DON'T CARE." LIKE ABRAHAM,
[2:10:49] IF I EVEN PLUNGE THIS KNIFE IN HIS BODY,
[2:10:52] GOD WILL GIVE HIM BACK TO ME.
[2:10:56] &gt;&gt; THAT'S THE KIND OF FAITH THAT CARRIED
[2:10:57] him over
[2:10:59] &gt;&gt; to be a father.
[2:11:01] &gt;&gt; In fact, is you're of his seed.
[2:11:04] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:11:05] &gt;&gt; Faith seed.
[2:11:07] and Mary,
[2:11:10] I'm preaching to you. I'm preaching to
[2:11:11] everyone. I'm preaching to my wife and
[2:11:14] my family.
[2:11:16] I'm preaching to you families.
[2:11:20] I labored over this for several weeks
[2:11:24] that you give him. He gave this message.
[2:11:27] I was in such confusion
[2:11:29] about the godhead, about baptism, about
[2:11:32] serpent seat, ALL OF THESE THINGS. THIS
[2:11:35] ONE SAYS THAT AND THIS PREACHER SAYS
[2:11:36] THAT AND SOMEONE ELSE SAYS SOMETHING. So
[2:11:39] what is it?
[2:11:42] It wasn't sincerity I needed. I had
[2:11:45] that.
[2:11:47] &gt;&gt; It wasn't desire I needed. I had that.
[2:11:51] &gt;&gt; What I needed was to have faith
[2:11:54] &gt;&gt; to penetrate through all that.
[2:11:56] &gt;&gt; And even without me knowing, God has
[2:11:59] given you given me. Look what you've
[2:12:02] gone through. LOOK AT THE THINGS YOU'VE
[2:12:04] HEARD. Think about families or whatever
[2:12:07] and emotions and all the connections and
[2:12:10] everything else
[2:12:11] &gt;&gt; and you go beyond it. You penetrate
[2:12:13] beyond it.
[2:12:14] &gt;&gt; Cuz you know you say within yourself and
[2:12:17] there's something deep within you saying
[2:12:19] this message is more than this. This
[2:12:21] message is more than that. This message
[2:12:23] is more than what people say it is.
[2:12:27] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:12:29] &gt;&gt; Glory to God.
[2:12:33] faith that would take them over.
[2:12:36] &gt;&gt; Faith that would go beyond.
[2:12:40] &gt;&gt; And I want to go beyond.
[2:12:42] &gt;&gt; You can have this world.
[2:12:44] &gt;&gt; You can HAVE ALL THIS VILE PERVERSION
[2:12:47] AND SIN. YOU CAN HAVE IT.
[2:12:49] &gt;&gt; THE WORLD'S HEADED that way BECAUSE THE
[2:12:52] GOD OF THIS EVIL AGE, HE DESIGNED
[2:12:54] everything that direction.
[2:13:00] I'm closing right now.
[2:13:11] I just say, "Where are all the
[2:13:13] multitudes?"
[2:13:17] I so identify with Mary
[2:13:21] when they were bringing all this rot and
[2:13:23] filth and viol vile accusations. She
[2:13:28] could have said, "WHERE ARE ALL YOU
[2:13:30] MULTITUDES?
[2:13:32] &gt;&gt; Where are all you people that were
[2:13:34] healed?
[2:13:36] &gt;&gt; WHERE ALL YOU PEOPLE THAT FED OF THE
[2:13:39] BREAD AND THE FISHES?
[2:13:41] &gt;&gt; WHERE ARE YOU?
[2:13:44] &gt;&gt; Where are all YOU THAT WERE HEALED?" AND
[2:13:46] HE SENT HIS WORD AND HEALED every one of
[2:13:48] them.
[2:13:50] &gt;&gt; Where all you people that were healed?
[2:13:53] &gt;&gt; See, friends, it has to go way beyond
[2:13:56] that.
[2:13:58] even getting healed and even seeing a
[2:13:59] miracle and even eating of miracle bread
[2:14:03] that doesn't keep you in the hour.
[2:14:05] &gt;&gt; I'm talking about a FAITH THAT GOES
[2:14:07] BEYOND THAT.
[2:14:10] &gt;&gt; Are you getting it, folks?
[2:14:13] &gt;&gt; Are you getting it?
[2:14:17] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:14:32] I won't take the time,
[2:14:34] but I have a whole series of quotes.
[2:14:38] And brother Brandham says to the people
[2:14:43] and he talks about the two on the way to
[2:14:45] Emmas, just give me these few moments.
[2:14:48] And he said, "If they only knew who he
[2:14:50] was,
[2:14:53] they were talking right with him and
[2:14:54] they were eating with him and didn't
[2:14:57] know who he was."
[2:14:59] And friend, and I'm saying and friend to
[2:15:02] you today. I'm not here to preach a
[2:15:05] sermon. I'm here to bring these as a
[2:15:08] reality to today. Brother Ram talks
[2:15:11] about the two in the way to Amaze. He
[2:15:12] comes up 2,000 years and he says, "And
[2:15:15] today,
[2:15:16] that's as true as it could be today.
[2:15:20] That's as true as I'm standing on this
[2:15:22] platform that the resurrected Jesus
[2:15:25] Christ is right in this building." Amen.
[2:15:29] &gt;&gt; And I couldn't tell you more
[2:15:31] purposefully. I couldn't tell you with
[2:15:33] more uh determination
[2:15:36] and fervent of zeal in my heart that
[2:15:40] Jesus Christ who said marry that Jesus
[2:15:44] Christ who stood with the prophet of
[2:15:47] God, that Holy Spirit, [snorts]
[2:15:50] that very pillar of fire is right in
[2:15:53] this building today. Amen.
[2:15:56] &gt;&gt; HE HAS TO BE THE SAME BECAUSE HE SAID
[2:15:58] HE'S THE SAME YESTERDAY. TODAY.
[2:16:01] &gt;&gt; EVERYONE SAY TODAY.
[2:16:03] &gt;&gt; TODAY.
[2:16:04] &gt;&gt; Say it again. Today
[2:16:05] &gt;&gt; and forever.
[2:16:07] &gt;&gt; We're not WORRIED ABOUT THE FOREVER
[2:16:08] RIGHT NOW. WE'RE NOT WORRIED about the
[2:16:10] past. WE'RE WE'RE TALKING ABOUT TODAY.
[2:16:13] &gt;&gt; RIGHT. TODAY.
[2:16:14] &gt;&gt; THAT SAME JESUS WHO SAID, "Mary
[2:16:18] &gt;&gt; knows your name."
[2:16:20] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[2:16:24] &gt;&gt; And I say, "Jesus, do you have something
[2:16:26] for me?"
[2:16:27] &gt;&gt; I don't have to tell him my name is Ed.
[2:16:30] &gt;&gt; He knows it.
[2:16:43] &gt;&gt; He said, "That's what's the matter with
[2:16:44] healing today? Somebody sick here?
[2:16:49] somebody didn't need a healing.
[2:16:54] Here's a prophet who saw thousands of
[2:16:57] them. That's the problem with healing
[2:17:00] today.
[2:17:06] They fail to recognize
[2:17:10] &gt;&gt; that he's right by you.
[2:17:13] I either have to believe that
[2:17:16] &gt;&gt; I have to chuck this Bible away.
[2:17:20] You're right here.
[2:17:23] If we had
[2:17:25] faith that could penetrate,
[2:17:29] you don't have to see them with these
[2:17:30] eyes because these eyes can tell you all
[2:17:32] kinds of things that aren't true. Right.
[2:17:35] &gt;&gt; But I'd sooner to a prophet
[2:17:39] &gt;&gt; that penetrated on a regular basis and
[2:17:41] have him tell you, "Oh, if you could
[2:17:42] only realize
[2:17:44] he's right beside you.
[2:17:46] &gt;&gt; He is right beside you." Not your
[2:17:49] theophony or something else, but he
[2:17:52] right. He he told Pentecostal people
[2:17:54] interdenominational at a big convention
[2:17:56] and you Pentecostal people he said if
[2:17:58] you could only realize
[2:18:02] he said if you could realize what is
[2:18:03] what is here he said a a revival a move
[2:18:07] of God would break out he said you
[2:18:08] wouldn't be able to stop
[2:18:16] &gt;&gt; said if you could hear and recognize
[2:18:18] that it's God's promise
[2:18:24] And I'm closing with this.
[2:18:29] This so touched me.
[2:18:32] I wanted to touch you.
[2:18:34] A woman stood in front of brother
[2:18:36] Brandham, Sarasota
[2:18:41] or I'm sorry, San Fernando, California.
[2:18:45] And he and he talks about he keeps the
[2:18:47] woman in the whole prayer line standing
[2:18:50] there and he begins to talk about John
[2:18:54] the fourth chapter and the woman at the
[2:18:56] well
[2:18:57] and perhaps 15 20 minutes and I'm only
[2:19:00] taking two or three 15 20 minutes he
[2:19:04] talks about the woman at the well a
[2:19:07] Samaritan
[2:19:09] and then he says he says to her I wonder
[2:19:15] if you ever thought that if you could
[2:19:17] stand where that woman stood.
[2:19:21] &gt;&gt; He said, "Wouldn't that be wonderful?"
[2:19:24] &gt;&gt; He says to her,
[2:19:27] "You always thought
[2:19:30] it would be wonderful."
[2:19:32] Then he goes from a suggestion,
[2:19:35] "I wonder if you've ever thought that.
[2:19:39] Wouldn't it be wonderful to stand where
[2:19:40] that woman stood?" And then he takes her
[2:19:43] thought.
[2:19:46] He says, "You always thought that would
[2:19:49] be wonderful."
[2:19:52] And he says, "If you only knew, my dear
[2:19:56] sister,
[2:19:58] you're standing in that same place."
[2:20:04] &gt;&gt; Friends,
[2:20:05] &gt;&gt; when I said a while ago, you could put
[2:20:07] yourself back there. This kind of faith,
[2:20:11] &gt;&gt; this kind of faith
[2:20:13] &gt;&gt; literally [clears throat]
[2:20:14] transports.
[2:20:15] &gt;&gt; You're back there. The same Christ is
[2:20:18] there. I'm at the seeler. I'm I'm there
[2:20:21] with Mary. I'm seeing the angels. And
[2:20:25] then the same Christ is in another form.
[2:20:29] FAITH THAT CAN SEE HIM IN ANOTHER FORM.
[2:20:36] Does it make any difference if I say
[2:20:38] this is him?
[2:20:41] &gt;&gt; This is him.
[2:20:43] &gt;&gt; Hollywood can't make a movie. This is
[2:20:44] not just a classic.
[2:20:48] &gt;&gt; THEY TAKE A CLASSIC book and and and
[2:20:50] make a hero and and they search all over
[2:20:53] the world to FIND SOMEBODY WHO COULD ACT
[2:20:54] THE MAIN PART.
[2:20:57] GET HIM TO SAY THIS RIGHT THING AND to
[2:20:59] look the right way and and to pour
[2:21:01] himself INTO A CERTAIN MOLD OF THE
[2:21:03] CHARACTER of the book.
[2:21:05] &gt;&gt; And God says, "That's not enough. I'll
[2:21:08] send you my spirit
[2:21:10] &gt;&gt; and my SPIRIT WILL COME INTO you
[2:21:12] &gt;&gt; and you will BE A DIFFERENT KIND of a
[2:21:14] person
[2:21:15] &gt;&gt; and you will NOW SPEAK THE WAY I SPEAK
[2:21:18] &gt;&gt; BECAUSE IT WON'T BE YOU. It'll be me in
[2:21:20] you that'll be doing the TALKING AND
[2:21:23] YOU'LL SEE THINGS DIFFERENTLY, NOT
[2:21:25] ACCORDING TO YOUR EYES. YOU'LL SEE
[2:21:27] THINGS ENTIRELY DIFFERENTLY BECAUSE
[2:21:29] IT'LL BE me in you. And the APOSTLE PAUL
[2:21:32] SAYS, "THIS IS THE GREAT MYSTERY. Christ
[2:21:35] in you, the hope of glory."
[2:21:44] says, "If you only knew, dear sister,
[2:21:46] [snorts] you're standing at the same
[2:21:48] place."
[2:21:49] He says, "You're aware that you're aware
[2:21:52] as a believer now that something's going
[2:21:55] on. And just since I turned this way
[2:22:01] and started talking, a real sweet,
[2:22:03] humble feeling has come over you.
[2:22:07] That is right.
[2:22:10] Cuz between you and I,
[2:22:14] &gt;&gt; you probably never seen the picture of
[2:22:16] it. That light
[2:22:20] &gt;&gt; is just milling between you and I.
[2:22:24] Oh my dear beloved friends, if you only
[2:22:28] knew Cloverdale Bible Way or whatever
[2:22:31] name, whatever church you come from or
[2:22:34] whatever it is,
[2:22:37] please hear these words, that same
[2:22:40] Christ.
[2:22:42] And it's a preacher's duty. It's my
[2:22:45] solemn responsibility
[2:22:48] to create this kind of atmosphere and
[2:22:50] let the Holy Spirit bring it as such a
[2:22:53] reality that you'll leave this place and
[2:22:55] say, "I I may not have that, BUT I WANT
[2:22:57] THAT."
[2:23:01] &gt;&gt; I'll go with you.
[2:23:02] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:23:06] Though others don't follow you,
[2:23:10] I'm going to go with you. I don't care
[2:23:13] what they say.
[2:23:15] All I know is you touched me. You spoke
[2:23:20] to me. You called my name. And nothing
[2:23:24] nothing on this earth can ever change
[2:23:26] that. No kind of difficulty. And
[2:23:30] anything that tries to tamper with my
[2:23:32] faith, I'll penetrate straight through
[2:23:34] it with the faith that you've given me,
[2:23:36] I'll penetrate straight through it. This
[2:23:38] faith is sharp because it came this
[2:23:40] faith came from the word of God which is
[2:23:43] so SHARP IT PIERCES BETWEEN EVEN THE
[2:23:46] soul and you'll carry me through
[2:23:50] &gt;&gt; to my place.
[2:23:51] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:23:56] &gt;&gt; God bless you my precious friends.
[2:24:00] God bless you.
[2:24:05] Don't let the world manhandle
[2:24:08] this blessed word.
[2:24:11] &gt;&gt; Don't let the man handle it. Don't let
[2:24:14] somebody try to dissect it
[2:24:17] &gt;&gt; and hand it to you.
[2:24:23] Let the Holy Spirit now
[2:24:26] finish his work in this service.
[2:24:28] Perhaps, Brother Ryan, if you would
[2:24:30] come, please.
[2:24:34] And we'll pray.
[2:24:36] Lord Jesus,
[2:24:38] I've been rather long.
[2:24:46] I just ask that you will take over,
[2:24:50] that you will say the things that should
[2:24:52] be said,
[2:24:54] that you will speak to the heart. man
[2:24:56] looks on the outward, but you said to
[2:24:59] Samuel, "Oh, God looks on the heart."
[2:25:02] And now we've had a message, oh God,
[2:25:06] that your messenger has said over and
[2:25:09] over and over again, this is his
[2:25:12] appearing.
[2:25:14] You have appeared. And now, Lord, you've
[2:25:17] even you've even come to us.
[2:25:21] You've come, oh God.
[2:25:25] I do not I do not ask you to explain it
[2:25:28] any further. I don't need it to be
[2:25:29] explained, but my faith believes it. I
[2:25:34] believe it. I pray that you will bless
[2:25:35] this congregation of people, visitors
[2:25:39] that are here that have been kind to
[2:25:42] perhaps sit and listen. I pray that you
[2:25:44] will touch every heart and every life.
[2:25:46] And now those that are going to be
[2:25:48] baptized. Oh holy one of Israel,
[2:25:53] &gt;&gt; I pray you'll hover over this tank of
[2:25:55] water. I pray that as each one is
[2:25:58] baptized,
[2:26:00] they will also be filled with the Holy
[2:26:02] Spirit that their life they will have a
[2:26:05] transforming experience in their life.
[2:26:09] In the name of Jesus Christ, I commit
[2:26:11] this congregation to you and the words
[2:26:14] that have been spoken now
[2:26:16] be glorified.
[2:26:18] Amen.
[2:26:27] I wonder if we could sing silently now.
[2:26:30] Uh what what number is that, please?
[2:26:37] Open my eyes.
[2:26:40] Would you like to stand with me, please?
[2:26:45] &gt;&gt; [music]
[2:26:45] &gt;&gt; And those that are going to be baptized,
[2:26:47] if you'd like to go and we'll have the
[2:26:49] baptismal immediately
[2:26:55] thousand
[2:26:57] [music]
[2:27:00] [singing]
[2:27:05] [music]
[2:27:06] [singing]
[2:27:10] [music]
[2:27:13] Silently [singing]
[2:27:15] now [music] I wait for thee
[2:27:21] [singing]
[2:27:24] to [music] see
[2:27:25] &gt;&gt; as a prayer now
[2:27:28] my eyes [singing]
[2:27:31] [music]
[2:27:37] [music]
[2:27:38] silently now once again silently
[2:27:43] I wait [music and singing]
[2:27:45] for thee.
[2:27:48] My God
[2:27:50] will [music]
[2:27:52] his will. Open [singing] my eyes.
[2:27:59] [music]
[2:28:03] [singing]
[2:28:07] &gt;&gt; [music]
[2:28:07] &gt;&gt; Open my ears that I may [music] hear.
[2:28:13] Voices [singing] of truth thou sendest
[2:28:17] [music]
[2:28:18] clear.
[2:28:20] And while [singing] the rain
[2:28:23] on [music]
[2:28:24] my ear,
[2:28:26] everything else [music] will disappear.
[2:28:30] [singing]
[2:28:33] Silently now I pray [music]
[2:28:37] for [singing] thee.
[2:28:39] Pray my God I will to see. [music]
[2:28:46] Open [singing] my eyes.
[2:28:52] Spit [music]
[2:28:53] [singing]
[2:28:55] divine.
[2:28:57] [music]
[2:28:59] Open [singing]
[2:29:00] my mouth and let me hear [music]
[2:29:06] [singing] the warm truth everywhere.
[2:29:10] [music]
[2:29:11] Open my heart [singing]
[2:29:14] and let me [music] prepare
[2:29:17] love with [singing] my children
[2:29:21] [music] to share.
[2:29:24] Silently [singing]
[2:29:26] now I wait for thee. [music]
[2:29:31] Pray [singing] my God thy will [music]
[2:29:35] to see.
[2:29:38] Oh [singing]
[2:29:38] my eyes.
[2:29:46] [music and singing]
[2:29:48] Join me. I say open mine eyes. Open
[2:29:51] [music and singing]
[2:29:52] my eyes.
[2:29:56] Me
[2:30:01] [singing]
[2:30:03] [music]
[2:30:09] [music]
[2:30:12] [singing]
[2:30:16] everyone now. [music and singing]
[2:30:19] Open my eyes to
[2:30:24] [music] be
[2:30:26] spine.
[2:30:29] [music]
[2:30:29] [singing]
[2:30:33] &gt;&gt; Isn't that wonderful?
[2:30:35] &gt;&gt; Isn't it wonderful
[2:30:36] &gt;&gt; to be able to express something [music]
[2:30:39] silently?
[2:30:40] Now
[2:30:42] I wait for thee.
[2:30:46] Ready my God I will [music] to see.
[2:30:54] Open [singing]
[2:30:55] my eyes
[2:30:58] [music]
[2:31:06] [music]
[2:31:07] with the woman at the well. I have. You
[2:31:11] have.
[2:31:13] [music]
[2:31:15] God sent you a messenger with a personal
[2:31:17] message.
[2:31:20] &gt;&gt; God bless you, brother Ben.
[2:31:23] Personal message to us.
[2:31:29] We don't want to read about her being
[2:31:30] back there.
[2:31:33] But she's
[2:31:35] that one that was with her.
[2:31:38] He said he's not a liar.
[2:31:42] He said, "You're there
[2:31:46] and he's here."
[2:31:49] I felt
[2:31:51] if I could get out of the role of being
[2:31:53] a [music] preacher,
[2:31:55] if I could get out of the role of being
[2:31:57] someone behind the pulpit, if I could
[2:32:00] only get the people to see that. If I
[2:32:02] could only see it,
[2:32:07] things we've [music] prayed for,
[2:32:10] things we've cried out to God for
[2:32:14] would begin to take [music] place. He
[2:32:16] said, "If you can recognize this," he
[2:32:18] said, "A revival would break out.
[2:32:21] &gt;&gt; A moving quad would break out."
[2:32:23] &gt;&gt; He said, "That you wouldn't be able to
[2:32:25] stop."
[2:32:28] &gt;&gt; I say, "God, do it.
[2:32:31] &gt;&gt; Take us, OH GOD, MOVE IN OUR HEART. MOVE
[2:32:33] IN MY HEART. Move in your heart. AND
[2:32:36] HELP US TO BELIEVE. HELP US TO SEE. HELP
[2:32:38] US TO GO BEYOND THIS flesh and the
[2:32:40] weakness and the frailty and all the
[2:32:42] failures. Have we failed?" WE'LL ALL SAY
[2:32:45] WE FAILED. WE DON'T WANT TO SAY that
[2:32:47] right now. We want to SAY DO YOU
[2:32:48] BELIEVE? YES, WE ALL BELIEVE.
[2:32:52] [music]
[2:32:54] &gt;&gt; I believe what you said, brother.
[2:32:57] Believe that it's here.
[2:33:02] It's calling my name.
[2:33:10] Thank you, Father.
[2:33:13] Thank you, Father.
[2:33:16] Continue to talk, Lord Jesus.
[2:33:20] You that stood just outside [music]
[2:33:22] behind Mary.
[2:33:26] You that stood and you watched Abraham
[2:33:29] take over. You You've been with us.
[2:33:31] You've seen everything. You've seen us
[2:33:33] in our joyous times. And you you've seen
[2:33:36] us when we've had maybe family and
[2:33:39] friends together and we have such a a
[2:33:41] nice time. It's not that
[2:33:44] you want to have a special time with us.
[2:33:46] Make it this morning, Lord. Make it this
[2:33:49] morning.
[2:33:51] Soon after the baptisms, the people will
[2:33:53] be going.
[2:33:55] I ask that you'll take this afternoon.
[2:33:58] Oh God of Israel,
[2:34:01] God of the prophets,
[2:34:04] God of Elijah, God of Moses,
[2:34:07] God, father of our Lord Jesus Christ,
[2:34:10] God of the prophet of God at this age.
[2:34:13] &gt;&gt; You're the God of William Brham. You're
[2:34:15] the God of Elijah. You're the God of
[2:34:17] this people. You're the God that we
[2:34:19] worship.
[2:34:21] &gt;&gt; There is no other God.
[2:34:25] &gt;&gt; You're the God of truth. You're the God
[2:34:28] that's made promises.
[2:34:30] &gt;&gt; You're the God of the eternal realm.
[2:34:32] You're the God that has spoken to us.
[2:34:34] You've spoken to us and told us about
[2:34:36] the two worlds. You've spoken us, oh
[2:34:39] God, and call us out of that realm, from
[2:34:42] that realm. In the name of Jesus.
[2:34:47] In the name of Jesus.
[2:34:50] I ask you to have your seats for a
[2:34:51] moment.
[2:35:00] A little chorus we know. Fill my cup,
[2:35:02] Lord. Fill it up.
[2:35:06] Fill [music] my cup.
[2:35:11] I [music] lift it up.
[2:35:18] &gt;&gt; [music]
[2:35:18] &gt;&gt; and
[2:35:22] his thirsty [music]
[2:35:25] my [singing] soul
[2:35:30] out of heaven
[2:35:33] [music]
[2:35:36] till [singing]
[2:35:37] I walk
[2:35:39] no more
[2:35:43] [music]
[2:35:45] till
[2:35:48] and make me. [music]
[2:35:55] &gt;&gt; I believe that's what each one of us won
[2:35:57] in the baptismal tank. We have brother
[2:35:59] Alex, sister Katie,
[2:36:02] Sister Lesie.
[2:36:04] They're here in the waters of baptism
[2:36:06] for one reason, one reason alone, that
[2:36:08] the Holy Spirit would come and fill them
[2:36:09] up. Amen.
[2:36:12] &gt;&gt; So, we heard this morning about faith.
[2:36:15] We wouldn't even know what faith was
[2:36:19] unless faith was brought through Malachi
[2:36:21] 4.
[2:36:23] &gt;&gt; That piercing faith that we heard about
[2:36:26] today.
[2:36:28] And how did sister Lesie come to to the
[2:36:30] waters of baptism? How does she have her
[2:36:32] two children standing in in these
[2:36:34] waters? is because another man was given
[2:36:37] a message
[2:36:39] and he carried it to them
[2:36:42] &gt;&gt; and gave them the message rapture. Is
[2:36:44] that right, Lesie?
[2:36:46] &gt;&gt; And and the church age book
[2:36:50] &gt;&gt; two books.
[2:36:53] Okay. Sorry.
[2:36:55] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[2:37:03] And we saw a heart turn
[2:37:08] &gt;&gt; and we've seen two children's hearts
[2:37:09] turn
[2:37:12] &gt;&gt; and and their daddy is not here or
[2:37:14] Leslie's husband's not here.
[2:37:18] &gt;&gt; But God did a wonderful thing by just
[2:37:20] coming to church.
[2:37:23] Brother Murphy and Sister Lesie were
[2:37:25] telling me today
[2:37:28] &gt;&gt; that he would be one uh smoking
[2:37:30] cigarettes here and at a pack a day and
[2:37:33] two packs in China a day.
[2:37:39] But by hearing the word of God
[2:37:42] and the washing of the water of the
[2:37:43] word,
[2:37:45] it took that sovereignly away from him.
[2:37:50] And sister Leslie has talked to her
[2:37:52] husband
[2:37:54] on the telephone. He's in China today.
[2:37:57] &gt;&gt; And he said, "This is a great day for
[2:37:59] our family."
[2:38:03] &gt;&gt; And I want to thank the Lord that this
[2:38:05] is a great day for
[2:38:09] Sister Leslie, would you like to say?
[2:38:18] &gt;&gt; I know today this is a very important
[2:38:20] day for me and my family.
[2:38:26] So I'm so thankful to the Lord that the
[2:38:28] message of Abraham preached
[2:38:32] &gt;&gt; so that our blind can see
[2:38:35] &gt;&gt; and our deaf can hear
[2:38:38] &gt;&gt; so that we can escape from the
[2:38:40] denomination of bondage.
[2:38:44] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord, Sister Lesie.
[2:38:46] I was reading this morning in the Bible
[2:38:50] &gt;&gt; and in Isaiah 30:18
[2:38:55] &gt;&gt; and the Bible says that in that day
[2:38:59] &gt;&gt; the deaf shall hear the words of the
[2:39:01] book
[2:39:03] and the eyes of the blind shall see out
[2:39:06] of obscurity
[2:39:09] and out of darkness.
[2:39:12] The meek shall increase their joy in the
[2:39:15] Lord,
[2:39:21] &gt;&gt; and the poor among men shall rejoice in
[2:39:24] the holy one of Israel.
[2:39:28] I think we can rejoice
[2:39:30] because I say that blind eyes do see,
[2:39:33] the deaf ears do hear,
[2:39:36] and a faith is still alive.
[2:39:40] &gt;&gt; Amen. Sister, let's leave. Why don't you
[2:39:42] stand right over here, children? You
[2:39:44] stand right there and you hold your
[2:39:46] wrist right here like on your wrist. You
[2:39:49] hold this right here like this.
[2:39:52] That'll help me. All right.
[2:39:54] All right.
[2:39:56] Let's bow our heads in a word of prayer.
[2:40:02] &gt;&gt; Truly, we can say it's manifesting time.
[2:40:06] The fruits are on the vine
[2:40:10] and this lovely one is coming in please.
[2:40:14] &gt;&gt; Lord, you've opened Sister Leslie's
[2:40:16] eyes.
[2:40:18] You've given her ears to hear.
[2:40:21] Lord, we rejoice in what you're doing in
[2:40:23] her heart.
[2:40:26] What you're doing in her children and
[2:40:27] her husband's life, Lord.
[2:40:29] No man can do this. But it's the Holy
[2:40:33] One of Israel.
[2:40:34] It's our lovely Lord Jesus Christ.
[2:40:38] The one that's present here in this
[2:40:39] baptism.
[2:40:41] I pray God you fill sister Lesie with
[2:40:43] the Holy Ghost. Lord, I pray that those
[2:40:45] that are around here will see the Lord.
[2:40:50] Make her life a witness and a test.
[2:40:53] Bless her and her husband. Lord
[2:40:56] God, we're so thankful for what you've
[2:40:58] done.
[2:41:00] Baptize her with the Holy Ghost and
[2:41:01] fire.
[2:41:03] Lord, let her testimony so rain
[2:41:07] that Jesus Christ is alive and well.
[2:41:10] Bless her now Lord. Let the dove descend
[2:41:13] and let the glory of God fill her heart
[2:41:17] in Jesus name. Sister Lesie, by your
[2:41:20] desire,
[2:41:22] by your confession
[2:41:24] that Jesus Christ is your personal
[2:41:26] savior,
[2:41:28] I baptize you in true Christian love
[2:41:31] in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ.
[2:41:34] Amen.
[2:41:38] [applause]
[2:41:40] [cheering]
[2:41:43] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:41:45] &gt;&gt; Amen, brother Lee. [applause]
[2:41:51] Glory, glory, glory. It's Katie, right?
[2:41:55] &gt;&gt; Amen. Sister Katie, would you like to
[2:41:56] say anything?
[2:41:59] &gt;&gt; You're fine.
[2:42:01] Well, she she told me, she said, "I come
[2:42:03] to church
[2:42:05] and and to see the people and to see
[2:42:08] what God is doing amongst this church. I
[2:42:10] want to be a part of that."
[2:42:13] &gt;&gt; Amen, Sister Katie. And God grant you
[2:42:15] desire your heart. God will fill your
[2:42:18] soul. Put your hands.
[2:42:26] &gt;&gt; Here's a young lady, Father.
[2:42:31] &gt;&gt; She's spoken from her heart.
[2:42:34] She's seen a life in a people.
[2:42:37] She saw God in this church,
[2:42:41] not in a building, Lord,
[2:42:43] but living in flesh.
[2:42:46] And that's the God that she's thirsting
[2:42:47] for
[2:42:49] that will dwell within.
[2:42:51] There will be a power that lays within
[2:42:54] her soul.
[2:42:56] &gt;&gt; God, I pray for Katie.
[2:42:59] &gt;&gt; You'll give her such strength.
[2:43:02] Lord, to her friends.
[2:43:05] Speak of this glorious message.
[2:43:08] This Jesus Christ,
[2:43:11] the one that she has seen in flesh.
[2:43:14] May I come and dwell in her flesh Lord
[2:43:18] &gt;&gt; in Jesus name.
[2:43:20] &gt;&gt; And sister Katie by your desire and
[2:43:22] confession
[2:43:23] that Jesus Christ is your personal
[2:43:25] savior
[2:43:26] I baptize you in true Christian death in
[2:43:30] the name of our Lord Jesus Christ.
[2:43:37] [applause]
[2:43:39] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:43:40] Hallelujah.
[2:43:43] &gt;&gt; [applause]
[2:43:45] &gt;&gt; I'm going to call Alex my little man.
[2:43:48] Amen. Alex saying the same thing.
[2:43:52] Coming to a church, witness Jesus Christ
[2:43:55] amongst the people.
[2:43:58] And all I believe what Alex said to one
[2:44:00] of the people, he said, "All I want I
[2:44:03] want to meet God.
[2:44:06] &gt;&gt; I want more of God."
[2:44:08] &gt;&gt; How old are you, Alex?
[2:44:09] &gt;&gt; 11.
[2:44:10] &gt;&gt; 11.
[2:44:12] My what I would have given to be 11
[2:44:14] standing in the waters of baptism.
[2:44:17] &gt;&gt; I know you want more of God, brother
[2:44:18] Alex. I know your desire. We went
[2:44:20] through salvation. Now Jesus Christ is
[2:44:23] your savior and your repentance. Now the
[2:44:26] Bible says repent and be baptized in the
[2:44:30] name of Jesus Christ for the remission
[2:44:32] of sins. And brother Alex, your desire
[2:44:35] will be fulfilled and he shall fill you
[2:44:38] with the Holy Ghost.
[2:44:41] Let's pray.
[2:44:43] Grab your hand there.
[2:44:47] Here's a little man standing in the
[2:44:49] waters of baptism.
[2:44:52] &gt;&gt; Maybe not understanding at all, but
[2:44:54] having a great desire
[2:44:57] to walk in the fullness of your word.
[2:45:01] I pray God you'll give Alex such
[2:45:02] boldness.
[2:45:04] I pray that he'll be a strength to the
[2:45:06] family. I pray that his life would be a
[2:45:08] dedicated life, Lord.
[2:45:10] that he'll find a secret place alone
[2:45:12] with God, that the scripture will come
[2:45:15] alive to him, that the boldness of the
[2:45:18] lion will be his portion,
[2:45:21] this glorious line of the tribe of Judah
[2:45:24] that have prevailed. Lord, anoint
[2:45:28] fill our dear brother Alex, we pray in
[2:45:32] Jesus name. And brother Alex, by your
[2:45:34] confession that Jesus Christ is your
[2:45:37] savior,
[2:45:39] I baptize you in true Christian love.
[2:45:42] &gt;&gt; In the name of our Lord,
[2:45:44] &gt;&gt; Jesus Christ,
[2:45:53] Lord,
[2:45:55] Brother Lee, it's worth it all, isn't
[2:45:57] it?
[2:45:58] Brother Lee that I believe gave him the
[2:46:01] books and here he is rejoicing.
[2:46:04] &gt;&gt; Put it all together. Brother Murphy
[2:46:06] witnessing 10 years ago to brother Lee.
[2:46:08] Brother Lee, Lord gets a hold of you.
[2:46:11] &gt;&gt; And all of a sudden Lesie and two
[2:46:12] children are in the baptism.
[2:46:14] &gt;&gt; Brother Johnny, which is their father,
[2:46:16] he's not far behind.
[2:46:19] &gt;&gt; When he comes back, he wants to be
[2:46:21] baptized.
[2:46:22] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. [applause]
[2:46:28] &gt;&gt; [applause]
[2:46:37] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:46:44] &gt;&gt; Here's a precious soul,
[2:46:46] Sister Melissa.
[2:46:49] God bless you.
[2:46:52] Amen.
[2:46:54] I know sister Melissa since a little
[2:46:56] girl.
[2:47:00] Real cough. Melissa real cough.
[2:47:03] Then one day, of course, as time would
[2:47:05] go on in life, she's gone on her way.
[2:47:09] Got married. All of a sudden, the Lord
[2:47:13] started to get real real to you, didn't
[2:47:14] you? Says Melissa. Just happened to be
[2:47:17] preaching that morning. and I was in
[2:47:19] seeing another brother in the office and
[2:47:22] and I had a tap on the door and and they
[2:47:24] knew that I was seeing this brother. I
[2:47:26] didn't know exactly what what was
[2:47:27] happening and they said, "Well, there's
[2:47:30] a sister out here that needs prayer."
[2:47:32] And brother Andy's just happened to be
[2:47:33] walking by the office door. And I said,
[2:47:36] "A sister that she wants prayer." And I
[2:47:39] come around the corner, of course, I see
[2:47:41] Sister Melissa. I said, "Well, it's not
[2:47:42] just a sister. This is Sister Melissa.
[2:47:45] I've been away for how many years?
[2:47:50] nine eight years and all you wanted to
[2:47:54] make sure is that the blood would cover
[2:47:57] your sins
[2:47:59] and brother Andy's we had the pre uh
[2:48:01] pleasure to pray sister Melissa
[2:48:05] &gt;&gt; and God has been dealing with you
[2:48:07] service service and you just want to put
[2:48:10] the past behind and go on with Jesus
[2:48:13] Christ.
[2:48:15] &gt;&gt; Do you want to say anything sister
[2:48:18] I don't know what I can say. Thank you.
[2:48:21] Just doesn't seem to be enough. I just
[2:48:25] thank the Lord for his grace and his
[2:48:26] mercy.
[2:48:33] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[2:48:38] &gt;&gt; Amen. If you would help me by putting
[2:48:40] That's it. That's how we're going to do
[2:48:41] it. Okay.
[2:48:43] All right. Let's pray.
[2:48:49] Father, we stand here. I believe in your
[2:48:51] August presence.
[2:48:53] [snorts]
[2:48:54] I believe your presence is confirming
[2:48:55] the word of God that we heard this
[2:48:57] morning.
[2:48:59] And I just pray Lord that as Sister
[2:49:01] Melissa has bass in the presence and the
[2:49:03] word of God that it will become alive to
[2:49:05] her. Lord,
[2:49:07] what can wash away my sins? Nothing but
[2:49:10] the blood of Jesus.
[2:49:12] &gt;&gt; What can make me whole again? nothing
[2:49:15] but the bleeding word,
[2:49:18] &gt;&gt; the blood of Jesus.
[2:49:20] And father, she's standing here. She
[2:49:23] wants wanting to make a commitment and a
[2:49:25] stand
[2:49:26] to stand in the waters of baptism and to
[2:49:29] testify. Lord,
[2:49:31] &gt;&gt; I'm a believer
[2:49:33] &gt;&gt; and I'll stand for Jesus Christ.
[2:49:35] &gt;&gt; I'll live the life that's worthy of the
[2:49:37] gospel of Jesus. I desire God a a
[2:49:41] refilling of the Holy Ghost. I pray Lord
[2:49:44] that you will so move
[2:49:46] &gt;&gt; in Melissa's life Lord that not only her
[2:49:49] husband will be affected but all around
[2:49:52] her will be affected Lord I pray that
[2:49:54] you'll give her such a peace that passes
[2:49:57] all understanding that Lord the shalom
[2:50:00] will be her portion in Jesus name and
[2:50:04] sister Melissa by by your desire to be
[2:50:08] identified with Jesus Christ in his
[2:50:11] death burial and resurrection ction and
[2:50:14] testifying that Jesus is your savior,
[2:50:17] your lover, your redeemer, your
[2:50:19] bridegroom and friend. I baptize you in
[2:50:22] true Christian baptism in the name of

[2:51:41] happened in the past, perhaps he wants
[2:51:43] to sit down with you,

[2:51:49] different things.

[2:56:37] all my world
[2:56:43] [music]
[2:56:46] and we said amen. Amen.
[2:56:49] Lord Tim, would you come and dismiss us
[2:56:52] in prayer? Thank you for your patience.
[2:56:55] If you think I'm fanatic, just [music]
[2:56:57] don't see me on the other side. Going to
[2:56:59] turn loose over there.
[2:57:07] Let's pray. [music]
[2:57:10] Wonderful heavenly father,
[2:57:14] what a great thing that you have done
[2:57:15] for us.
[2:57:18] Lord, just so reveling and feasting on
[2:57:21] the word that you have spoken this
[2:57:23] morning that zeroed us in, Lord, that
[2:57:26] it's not just your desire to bring us
[2:57:29] out of a world of sin and leave us in
[2:57:32] the humanity of frailty, but Lord, you
[2:57:35] do grind and assay that down, Lord,
[2:57:38] through the trials of our faith to take
[2:57:41] us beyond our humanity into the
[2:57:44] supernatural realm that we were meant to
[2:57:46] dwell in.
[2:57:48] Oh, how great thou art, oh God. And we
[2:57:51] desire that, Lord, as hard as it was to
[2:57:53] be birthed from the world to the new
[2:57:56] birth, yet take us further, Lord, to be
[2:57:58] birthed from this realm to another
[2:58:00] realm, from mortal to immortality,
[2:58:03] from this body to another body, Lord. We
[2:58:06] want all of it. That's our confession
[2:58:09] this morning. We want all of it. No
[2:58:11] matter what it takes, Lord, no matter
[2:58:13] what we have to go through, and we might
[2:58:16] have to go through some hard times,
[2:58:18] [music] Lord, let the trial of our faith
[2:58:21] bring forth that realm that you have for
[2:58:24] us in our lives. Oh God,
[2:58:28] we thank you for what you've done in
[2:58:30] these lives this morning in the waters
[2:58:32] of baptism. [music]
[2:58:34] It's a great step, oh Lord, a great
[2:58:37] confession.
[2:58:39] Thank you, Father, for what you did in
[2:58:40] every life in this service. [music]
[2:58:42] Thank you, Father, for what you did for
[2:58:44] those that are watching and will watch
[2:58:45] on the internet. We are sure that your
[2:58:48] word will not return to you void. So, as
[2:58:52] we go our way, we go in expectation.
[2:58:55] [music] We go joyously. We go not caught
[2:58:58] up in the human emotion of the event,
[2:59:00] [music] but we go being moved into a
[2:59:04] greater depth and a greater joy of our
[2:59:06] salvation [music] in the Lord Jesus
[2:59:09] Christ. Thank you, Father, for this time
[2:59:12] we've had in your presence, [music]
[2:59:13] the time of prayer, the time of worship,
[2:59:16] the time around your word. We pray you'd
[2:59:18] restore brother Biscll's strength and
[2:59:21] Lord, you' just pour in abundantly as he
[2:59:23] has labored in your word. And Lord, we
[2:59:26] just commit our ways to you as we go
[2:59:28] this afternoon, whether here [music] to
[2:59:29] or to other meetings. We commit it all
[2:59:32] into your hands for your glory in the
[2:59:35] name of our Lord Jesus [music] Christ.
[2:59:38] Amen.
[2:59:39] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. God bless you. The service
[2:59:42] is dismissed. Shake hands with one
[2:59:44] another as you go in [music] the name of
[2:59:45] our Lord Jesus Christ.
[3:00:01] &gt;&gt; [music]
[3:00:17] &gt;&gt; Hey. Hey. Hey. [music]
