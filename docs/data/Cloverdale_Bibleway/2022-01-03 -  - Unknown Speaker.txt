uh if you wouldn't mind turning into a scripture zachariah zechariah 2 verse 5. i remember way back in the 90s brother michael when when the philippine brothers came here and they and the brothers sang the song what we have is the pillar of fire we have sung that from that time on yes sir and zechariah says here in chapter 2 zechariah 2 and verse 5 says for i saith the lord will be unto her a wall of fire round about and will be the glory in the midst of her and i want to say lord we want to give you all the glory tonight for you are definitely in the midst of her this little lady called the bride of jesus christ so let's just bow our heads in a word of prayer our dear heavenly father we have gathered here tonight lord this little assembly giving you thanks lord a thanksgiving offering lord so grateful for what you've done within the assembly of the living god here in cloverdale bible way lord we look at a building that is a building indeed but lord we're looking at the

magnified for truly the pillar of fire is in the midst of her and so lord bless the evening bless our pastor bless the assembly bless each and every one we pray in jesus name amen amen amen you may

[Music] [Applause] [Music] children of the kings the manifested bride of jesus [Music] [Applause] praise the lord well we're just going to change a little bit of the order of the evening right now we have a little bit of a surprise maybe for most of you tonight we are going to have brother caleb from shanghai china speak to us brother murphy would you mind joining us please this is a very special event for me i just want to hold it all together we've loved him we have known caleb before marriage we've known him with brother murphy we've had the privilege to go and be with the man of god such he is we mentioned it to the saints at the november meeting down in at mount baker of the the events that took place and the arrests that were taking place and how that then brother payne was the first that was released in june brother elvi in august and he went after he got out of out of incarceration went out and baptized three more people so here we are with brother caleb who was released november the 11th and was in uh for 20 months 20 months as i said to the saints can you imagine 20 months the church in shanghai never had a service for 20 months the saints didn't gather and they all met brother caleb when he came out of incarceration and not one of the church was missing that's the word standing brother murphy would you please introduce hundreds but we understand that the gospel of jesus christ is the same yesterday today and forever the bible says when one member suffers we all suffer but when one rejoices we all rejoice and i want to thank the lord jesus that you as a church body have been a part of what god's been doing in china and we'll continue to support whatever god and whatever doors god opens for us so i thought that that would be a wonderful segment in this going into this new end of one year and going into a new year to see these brothers have sacrificed their all for their message and it gives me a challenge to accept that we could do the same amen well i think i would like to invite a couple of brothers up here with me and michael brother sam would you please come up brother dan would you please come up brother jean would you please come up come on up so we've gone from the mission fields to a local field our local assembly wasn't in your day hey michael come sit down well this is the beginnings of a prayer group a group of men that were burdened for our assembly and maybe sam if you would like to say something well good evening everyone and uh sorry i got to read notes here i scribbled down some thoughts on paper just to um just to say how much i appreciate this last year and being able to walk together with you and so it's been an honor and privilege to walk together and uh to see each one of you doing your part laboring for the lord to see what brother caleb has done it's it's humbling to to sit here after that and and you know everyone's got to do their part so you find out what you uh what you can do and that's what i think the lord was dealing with with our hearts early this year i think individually the lord was dealing with you down brother jean was coming to the church praying praying by himself wanting the lord to do something and i think brother johnny waldner had come up and said something about we need we need to we need to start maybe having a prayer meeting or let's let's get together and that's kind of how the brothers started to get together and we wanted to talk about the lord and share what the lord is doing with each one the year has been a challenging time but the lord has given his grace and and i definitely to see some of the prayers the the requests that have been prayed i wanted to see how many um young one not just young ones but how many have been baptized this year is there i know brother nathaniel vizso god dealt with you um just put your hands up brother hudson or your sister reya um yeah sister rebecca gwyneth i mean they're yeah more i i think there's a ton and that's kind of what our burden was is our families and uh i don't know you want to see a little bit [Music] living in one uh yeah like brother sam said uh it was right in the middle of of koved uh we didn't have services we're streaming and we just got you know under under a burden uh i remember i i was at home and i told my wife i need to go to the church i need to be in prayer and i texted brother mike i was like can you meet me at the church and open the sanctuary though for me and we met here and i was just here with myself and i just you know just burdened and just prayed then we met at the end and he told me that other brothers were also thinking about starting a prayer meeting and we'll just see how the lord leads so it was just supernatural how without really planning without texting or anything just god just started dealing with each one of us i'm just a burden for for prayer um yeah good evening everybody um that's exactly how it was it was just and i know from in my heart it was we were in the middle of covet and if everyone can remember the church was completely empty we're just a few of us here to run video and sound and things and i know throughout the 2020 and into 2021 um it just didn't bring a coldness but it brought um just a lack of togetherness and you could feel it in your own lives even individually and collectively and so i for my burden it started around the time of easter and i was streaming a service and you know just something just dropped in my heart and the lord was just like do something you need to do something and i know many times even in our own minds we say okay what's the what's the ministry going to do what's the pastor going to do what's this person going to do maybe someone should start something but the lord just dropped in my heart do something and so i didn't know what it was i was like okay lord what what is this and just reading in the message from you know a couple messages desperations and and conference with god and that's been a special message of my life and i was like you know like we can have a conference let's have a conference with god and you know i know there was a couple of brothers on my heart that god had kind of put on my heart that i knew were in the same victory and myself we had talked i think mike we i sat in your office and we had talked and then from there i just i came to talk to you by the time and then you know you had said oh sam had been talking about it john hadn't talked to mike about it so we're like okay if this is kind of where the lord is leading then you know what can we do can we should we how can we do it and so we obviously spoke with you and initially we're just going to all come as brothers and just sit in the sanctuary here and just have a little word of prayer just to be together but it kind of grew from that and we kind of we wanted to more have a bond and be able to fellowship around the things of god and just to lift each other up and so kind of started with just about nine nine ten brothers i think it was i think the four of us on this couch and then i think victor and david adamurra was the first ones john wallner who was one of the first ones as well my dad as well and from there it just it just grew and grew and the lord has been moving and doing wonderful things to the prayer meeting so that's that's kind of the start of it so there's a quote in business and i've mentioned it to the uh the brothers many times but i'm gonna reiterate it here today and it says managers push people to do things they don't want to do but leaders inspire people to do things they never thought they could and you know uh when this faith challenge report came out on the picture was brother biscuit and brother lonnie jenkins probably in their i don't know late 30s early 40s um doing what they could doing exactly what brother caleb has inspired brother caleb to do it's been 50 years of a vision and of leadership and i think it's it's so important to recognize the um the inspiring leadership that has been given our example um so not only from from brother biscuit but it's come down from brother tom brother murphy brother tim um we're not talking about uh people who who are just talking about doing something but actually doing it um you know brother brown have said you know he's not one to go around and kiss the babies but he's you know wielding a sword um you know he talked about the fireman the little fireman who's you know running around you know at the big fire and he's like a little fire here a little fire there and then the the big chief came in from jeffersonville and he said follow me boys like we're gonna we're gonna do something and get this done and i think those examples have now been our examples so now you've got brothers you've got next generations that are now needing to step up and are stepping up and [Music] you know the prayer meeting we started with brothers and we've had actually one and we want to do one every month with the families where we come with their wives and our children because not only do we have you know the ministry as leaders but the fathers and husbands that's a strong home strong strong husband strong fathers strong homes strong families that's really what is needed and uh that became a burden in the prayer meetings of um our families our homes and that's why we were praying for our children and then for brother ray to come with his son nathaniel and nathanael get gives his heart to the lord these are massive milestones for for our um you know we started putting down on the board answered prayer um because we can pray for so many things but we want to see god answering so you know you just heard brother caleb say his son needed prayer who prayed brother tom god answered prayer and and that's where what we are expecting we are expecting god to answer prayer so you know um what really touched me i don't know how many months ago or when brother henry came up here to be prayed for he needed prayer and brother tom came down to pray for him like a dad is praying for his son you know i i want we all need to know when we come up for prayer there's confidence there that god is going to answer prayer uh the father's in the home when when the children are sick the wife and the children need to know that when the daddy comes down to pray god is going to answer the prayer so we have the examples and now it's moving into the next generation and inspiring the next generations to to do that to to step into their into their position and uh so yeah as our ministry praise god answers the brothers and sisters pray god answers big or small god answers prayer so we just wrote down a few things that god answered in the last few months brother gabe florent there's a whole testimony from two weeks before he came to church but the florent family was having a baby dedication and it was premeditated they're praying that god is going to deal with their their children and god answered and there's been many yes contin you know things that followed through that uh brother phil i talk over on vancouver island needing god to deal with his life needing a job god's trying he's he's a prince sitting over here you know in our congregation god answered prayer um brother victor and sister sarah adamura had a baby that was being medevaced to seattle in flight to the tr yeah to the trauma center god we the brothers were praying in flight baby was healed um we have um brother nathaniel ravidzo and all the children and sons and daughters have been baptized we had just small things brother rowan had an insurance issue with his with his vehicle you know like brother leon said ask right he asked and it was he was given more than he could even ask for um yeah i mean well all the different ones that have come from from witnessing the lord's just really done a special work and so i just wanted to thank the lord for that and thank you for just being a part of this uh family and serving god together so the brothers that were at the prayer meeting uh we started there's of course sitting there and of course you know like anybody else when the honey is around the bears like donny and i kept on hearing great things and of course i tried to be there as many times as i can and then and it grew dan you've been a great part leading in song sam taking a request john and michael it's a great thing so the brothers that have been in brother david you're in the back there and talk about another prince these are brothers that have come into the prayer meeting so they have a song for you tonight so the prayer meeting brothers are going to have a sing to the lord let's get ready [Applause] so well tonight i just wanted to also give for no doubt thanks the lord for even for my family i know i shared this testimony at uh the prayer meeting but i just want to share it with all of you about a month ago um the doctors diagnosed my wife and the baby that she has inside of her that was something called trisomy 18 which meant that the baby would be born with birth defects or it wouldn't live past uh a month of its birth and since we're here this is squash tonight we just want to give testimony to the lord and you know it went went on for about three weeks uh that we didn't hear back we had to go run some different tests but that day i immediately um the scripture says go to the elders of the church and have them lay hands on you and pray so i was i was at work that day but the tomb of the murphy were there and i just want to thank them for their their faithfulness and their labor and you know when you have confidence in the word of god you're going to have confidence in men who demonstrate the word of god in their own lives and so as we prayed we i i know without a shadow of a doubt that the holy spirit came down and healed my wife in that moment and three weeks later we heard that there was no problems no issues so we just want to give glory to god and thank the lord for what he's done the song is very simple just says i give you praise lord i give you praise o my lord with all my heart with all my soul [Music] i give you praise i give you praise with all my heart [Music] i give you friends [Music] with i give you praise [Music] is [Music] [Music] precious [Music] oh [Music] is [Applause] for me

uh sanjeev he he knows brother roshan and also brother tim dodd when brother tim was over in india they met yeah we went you met yeah and the god of course started to deal with our dear brother there and he's come here and he desires to be baptized in the name of the lord jesus christ and we are speaking on sunday and everybody was gone and he says he knew the baptismal tank was here he said there's water there what does hinder me and so i thought of course through the scripture in acts 8 where there was a ethiopian eunuch and god caught philip up in the spirit and beginning at jesus christ he preached the cross and that revelation struck that eunuch saw the water and said what doth hinder me and i said well how about a few days and i thought it would be something special to have a baptismal yeah on this new year's eve service to give god the glory and give him praise brother sanji uh praise the lord so just i'm just grateful for this moment that lord has given us especially me and it's been really a long time when you know some things you want to correct it and you know old baptism we're coming into the correct one so there's only one one correct baptism that's right

sing the song for a long time but may it just be a testimony as we testify tonight we have testified when we sing a microphone there it is if there's mistakes forgive us there'll be plenty of forgiveness and mistakes can you just give us our notes [Music] this is [Music] one day old man brought a crippled man to jesus he's still in lifeless he lay upon his bed he had not moved since he was just a baby so still he longed to become a normal man now we don't know much about the men that carry the corners of his tattered bed that day but if we may create an illustration we'll see what these men might have to say suppose that first man said i hate to doubt it for jesus touched my eyes when i was blind he made me see and there's no doubt about it but this man's needs are more serious than mine suppose that second man said no need to bother this man's condition will remain the same though jesus touched my hand when it was withered i don't believe he could heal a man so lame suppose the third man said i hate the question but no one here is more skeptical than me though jesus cleansed me when i was a leper this helpless man will never walk his seat and every eye was turned to the fourth man to see how he might criticize and doubt but all three men were startled with amazement when that poor man stopped [Music] chains of death was found this man named jesus called me out if you think your little problem is too big for him to solve take it from the one who served the mighty voice [Music] my name is lazarus could i testify oh my this man named jesus called me up if you think your little problem is too big for him to solve take it from the one who's heard the mighty voice of god a living testimony of his death defying touch my name is a living testimony of indeed my name is lazarus [Music] [Music] sir amen a living testimony of a death defying touch i thought yo my name is gabriel could i testify amen hey man just put your name there go into 2022 and say my name is margaret michael jack i'm gonna testify i was dead and i'm alive once more i'm going into 20 22. happy new year let my people go god bless you amen [Music] my god [Music] it looks like it's like walk
