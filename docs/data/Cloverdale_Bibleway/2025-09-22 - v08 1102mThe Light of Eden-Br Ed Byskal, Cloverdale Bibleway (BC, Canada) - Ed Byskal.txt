So, that sounds that sounds good. &gt;&gt; Uh sisters are just going to sing a song. There's the just a note here that it's from Mark 5:25-34 speaking of the woman with the blood issue. God bless you. [Music] 12 years she suffered with no hope. She just grew up physicians. There were many yet she was bound by their curse. on the verge of simply giving up, not knowing what to do. All her hopes were truly shattered. It seemed her life was through. Then she heard a commotion. People talking in a street. They said someone is coming. I think it's Jesus the Nazarene. They said that he could heal the sick and cause the blind to see. She wondered in her heart, could you do the same for me? [Applause] She began to make her way down the road to where he was. And though the crowd was pressing, she refused to give up. She reached out and touched his clothes for healing to impart. She not only touched his hand that day, she touched his heart, she touched the heart of Jesus. Her faith had made her home. In a moment's time, she took back what Satan had controlled. She found in her failing a brand new place to start. She not only touched his hand that day, she touched his heart. [Music] Without him, she had never seen me on her knee. But she trusts the chosen, the only one who could make her love complete. She touched the heart of Jesus. Her faith had made her whole. In a moment's time, she took back what Satan had control. She found in her failing, a brand new place to start. She don't only touch his hand that day, she touched his heart. [Music] She found in her failing a brand new place to start. She not only touched his hand that day. She touched his heart. She not only touched his hand that day. [Music] She touched his heart. [Music] Amen. Thank you, sisters. Amen.

He's there. He's already there. He's in each one of us. Fills all time and space. All we want to do is be able to see him. Amen. The first verse.

I just if I were God, I'd be pleased to have a people that were singing from the depths of their heart in all sincerity, laying everything else aside, saying, "All I want to see, &gt;&gt; Amen, &gt;&gt; is Jesus in me." &gt;&gt; Amen. Isn't that wonderful? &gt;&gt; Well, we we had a great time yesterday with uh at the wedding of our brother Simeon Iverson and Sister Leah Barios. uh and uh trust we were able to start them off on a happy beginning. Amen. God bless them and the family that is still here with us. We're so thankful for that. Uh sorry we can't accommodate everybody in the fellowship or rather in the sanctuary. We understand that one of the deacons just told me the fellowship room is maxed out. Uh we're thankful that you're here. We're thankful that you came to church, whether you're in the fellowship or in the nursery or wherever you are. And we're very very thankful for all of those that are uh streaming with us as well. And uh uh and and they're happy to be part of it. And so we want to greet them wherever they might be at this moment or when they may archive if it's a time zone is different. But we give them special greetings and I believe that they uh are some are streaming from uh Switzerland this morning as well uh where we have just experienced a marvelous marvelous miracle, supernatural miracle from God on behalf of our brother Jean Jacques and we are grateful to God. But I know prayers have been made all different parts of the world for him and so we give all the glory to God. &gt;&gt; God has heard our prayers. I have a a brief email from his brother uh brother Gerard and sister Angela Michel where sister Ruth and I stayed just a few about a month ago. And he has said this uh after he opened with a paragraph of greetings. I think that all these requests from my brother Jean Jacques before our God have been heard by him in such a way of compassion. He answered our prayers and we are all very blessed by this we could say resurrection. &gt;&gt; Amen. I thought that was a very fitting word. &gt;&gt; He said, "Because it was." One day we shall know why. Jean Jacques said to a doctor, "This happened that I can testify to you about the kingdom of God." And this Friday, Jean Jacques testified about the message and gave some booklets to several. He can speak, read, write, and react positively to everything. He must still rest. And tomorrow, Sunday, they are with us today. He was just saying we're going to be streaming the service. And so, we want to say, God bless you, brother George. Thank you for this report and blessings from this entire congregation, prayers of this congregation. Please convey it to our brother Jean Jacqu. Uh we also received a letter from brother Jeanjac's wife, sister Marionette. And if she's uh streaming today, we want to send special greetings uh to you, Sister Marionette, and through you to your husband and to all of the family. She has said these words, big steps are made every day. John Jocks becomes more and more independent. For example, he walked half an hour this afternoon and he is pleased to talk with us. Nevertheless, it wears him out. Let's not forget it's just one week since he was out in a coma. Right. Praise God. &gt;&gt; And these things which he is doing is what the medical team and the best they have have said he would not be able to do any of these things. &gt;&gt; That's God Almighty. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. That's none less than God. And Jesus said, "We are so grateful for this spectacular evolution worthy of a spectacular God. We are so thankful for all your support, messages and kindness and prayers. And John Jacques asked to thank every one of you for all you did and are doing for him. She said he is the same yesterday, today, and forever. &gt;&gt; We say, "Praise God." We're so thankful. We're also real happy to have our brother Owen Jorgensson with us today. For those of you that have read the little blue books, uh, brother Owen has worked for years on the books on the life of brother Brandham. And brother Owen, when we were in Ukraine, it was such a pleasant surprise to have uh, the brothers from Villnus stand up and all of the books have been translated. I won't say all of them, but they had the first three translated and put in a beautiful book. Uh all three of them are in one book, a thick book. Um and he said it's been such a blessing. So there it is in Russian and uh they said that they're ready to do the next three. Uh they're preparing to do it and just finalizing it. I'd like you to come and greet the people if you would please, brother Owen. God bless you and welcome. &gt;&gt; Well, uh it is always a joy for me to come up and fellowship with you here. It's just always a blessing and uh uh greet you in the name of the Lord and uh give you a little report on the sixth book. It's it's virtually done. maybe a little bit of editing or polishing left, but uh I'm uh we're we're working on the details of publishing now and I'm just really confident or hopeful or Lord willing I'm looking for it the first of next year. So, we're finally there. And uh uh yesterday I was fellowshipping with a number several brothers and sisters. And it's always a joy to me when I do travel to have people come and say how this particular story meant something to them and how this story here touched their lives. And it's just such a blessing to me because uh I've been at this so long and I've put in somewhere between 10 and 12,000 hours writing this biography. When I started, I had no idea what I was what a huge task it was, but it's a great blessing to me to see that it is a blessing to you. So, God bless you. I wanted to give a little bit of thanks to your pastor, brother Bisll, here because uh I don't know if he remembers this or not, but somewhere around 18 years ago, I c I had heard that uh brother Billy Paul was going to be up here giving a testimony. And I had just gotten I I'd already done a couple of years of research, but I just started writing the biography. And uh I felt it would be such a advantage to me if I could meet brother Billy Paul and uh you know then have a a little bit of a relationship with him where I could call him and ask him questions from time to time and see things that I'm writing about his dad and he knows a few things that I wouldn't know or wouldn't glean from the tapes. So I called brother uh Biscll and I told him what I wanted to do and asked him if I could have a short interview which with brother Billy Paul and of course now I've known your pastor. It was about 1971 or two when I first met uh your pastor but you know he has a lot of acquaintances and Billy Paul who's be here just a short time would have a you know quite a few demands in his time and brother Ed is the pastor is responsible to see that uh you know he's that brother Billy Paul's not swamped or overdone and I'm sure he prayed about it but here I am just a young man with a dream that's all I was well I'm you know a brother or a sister but uh we all have things we'd like to do that never get done. I mean most of us are there and here's a young man with a dream who calls and asks for this interview and I just wanted to thank him that he felt it on his heart to say yes. I'm going to squeeze a little time in for brother Owen to meet with Billy Paul and he did after church and I got to meet Billy Paul in a room and uh talked to him 15 minutes told him what I was wanted to do and asked if I could call him if I you know had a question for him and and then as gracious as Billy Paul is he said yes call me anytime and he was uh and he did supply some key bits of information now and then so I I don't know if brother if you remember that. But anyway, uh thank you very much for having some confidence in a young man with a dream. So, God bless you all. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Well, just one more item before we read the word. We had an in inspection of our school happens once every six years and two inspectors come in from the department of education, the government of British Columbia and they spent two days Monday and Tuesday. Uh, brother Randy Timberman's the uh, principal of the school has said that the representatives uh, were here for these two days and u, he said this is a very thorough inspection that occurs every six years. The last one completed was in 2002 said, "I'm very pleased to pass on to you that BCA continues to meet all requirements of the Independent Schools Act." and he said that he wanted to in his letter to me to commend the teachers. But I want to commend uh brother Randy Timberman's as principal and all of the teachers and all of the volunteers and the students and everyone who has had something to do and those of you that have supported the school. that support has increased as far as physical presence of the people. Uh we are having of course uh there are there are parents who would like to send their children uh but are perhaps unable to pay tuition. So we're thankful for those that have sponsored still have need of some that can sponsor because we've come into some difficult times. And if you're able to do something along that line, any contribution would be very very much appreciated. I can tell you one thing, and I am absolutely convinced of this. On the other side, those of you that have had your children in the school will never regret that they heard what they heard in the school, and you'll never regret that they missed hearing what they would hear in the public school. Right. Amen. &gt;&gt; You'll never regret. I regret some of the things that I've been exposed to in the world. And I think it's a marvelous thing that these young people and these children. Now, I realize that not all from the church are able to be there. And there are many that are in distant places and across in different countries. There are some that have moved around the world. to have their children in this school. And I say, God bless you. And those of you that have had a difficult time financially, but you've kept your children in the school, I say, God bless you. Because if I had the option of having my children in an environment with ungodly teachers, teachers that know nothing about God, or having them in this school, it's not even a decision. That's right. &gt;&gt; Some of you are quiet and you shouldn't be quiet. You ought to be saying, "Thanks be to God that we can have them in that kind of an environment." And the the uh inspectors come with three different uh aspects of their uh inspection and the number one is commendations. That is good things that they can say. The second segment is suggestions that they may have for improving the school. And the third is items requiring immediate attention. And after two days, they never had one item that needed further or immediate attention. Their commendations commending the school and the class, the teachers, the staff, the student body said they noticed a very strong correlation between BCA and our faith. They commented commented on how it was evident in the classrooms that our faith was the root of our program. Isn't &gt;&gt; that wonderful? Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; They commented that our children are very happy and engaged in their learning. And when asked what they liked about BCA, our students said things like, "No bad language and teachers that care about us." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; They liked how our school expectations were clear and noted how this spoke to our school culture. They stated how they detected a strong shared commitment from all the staff. They appreciated our motivation to the future and our desire to improve our school with its programs and they were encouraged by our motivation and they made special comment on the quality of our school policy and the documents and the filing systems etc. They were impressed with the quality of the equipment and they were also impressed with the fact that we did as much as we did with as little finances as we had. They thought that that was excellent. And they said that BCA they said how uh what a welcome and comfortable uh feeling that they had and they felt at the school and they were so well and warmly received which is not always the case. They even went on to say that one of the programs that has been instituted by the school, they would like to take it to other schools throughout this entire region as an example. &gt;&gt; I thought that this was remarkable. Now, you know what that is? You'll understand it better by and by in about the next hour or so as I speak to you about we are the light of the world. And even when you don't realize that you are shedding forth light, you are doing so. I'd like you to stand if you would with me. And uh you know I don't think it's out of place. I think that our godly teachers along with our principal brother Randy and all the volunteers and all of the parents and all that are part and parcel of this assembly. I think we should give our our our our people and our staff a good hand. [Music] See, I fully expect that if time should go on, those that are there as young ones, they're going to be sitting where you're sitting. They're going to be taking places of responsibility. And I'm very very thankful that we're able to have this kind of a school in this day that we're in. Amen. Let's just have a word of prayer. Father, I'm standing here today feeling humbled in your presence, asking that you will do something special for all that have gathered today. Such a variety of needs, such a variety of backgrounds, such a variety of thoughts. And so I'm asking, oh Holy Spirit, that you will come now and command every thought to come into subjection to the plan and will of almighty God. Oh God of light and God of life, God and author, father of our Lord Jesus Christ, author of salvation, author of redemption, who has brought this great plan and you put it into operation. Thank you for the message that you've sent. A faithful messenger that would not he would not be be deterred. He would not uh be sidetracked. But oh God, you kept him to bring it so accurately and so precisely. Give us understanding today, Lord. How we need understanding of the Holy Spirit. I pray that you will give us a heart and a desire that will follow follow your word with purpose with resolve. And today, Lord, I pray that you will functionize. You see what's in my heart, oh God, and may it be delivered by the Holy Spirit down into the heart and into the deep recesses. I pray of every living person here today. And Father, now I give myself unreservedly to you. I pray that the people will receive father the moving of the Holy Spirit that they may be fully yielded. Lord, we don't want any resistance to the Holy Spirit. I pray that they'll be re yielded to you. All that are listening and ever will listen, I ask that you'll confirm your word in Jesus Christ's name. Amen. Amen. And all the people said, "Amen." Hallelujah. I was going to sing a course, but we don't need to. Oh, thank you, Jonathan. I'm going to read if you would please in Genesis the first chapter. Reading verses 1 through 4. In the beginning, God created the heaven and the earth. And the earth was without form and void, and darkness was upon the face of the deep. And the spirit of God moved upon the face of the waters. And God said, "Let there be light." And there was light. And God saw the light that it was good. And God divided the light from the darkness. Amen. You may be seated. Keep your Bibles at the ready if you would please because we have other scriptures I want to read. Now I'm going to ask for your very very keen attention and uh I want to try to convey some thought to you. I think that it's it's uh more important than we can possibly grasp the the fact the principle that the message which God sent to us at this time is a progressive it's a progressive message. And so every once in a while it's important that we have like an overview. So many that are in the message fail to grasp that God was literally moving moving through time if we have to say a timeline of the message. He's moving through time in our day with the word as it was unfolded and as it was fulfilled and various scriptures that were fulfilled. It's important to see it uh moving in that direction so that we can because uh you know uh scriptures can be taken completely out of context for example and we could be looking for something to be fulfilled that has been fulfilled and that's why brother Brandham says they'll be looking for Elijah and he's already come. They'll be looking for a rapture and it's already come. And so those scriptures cannot be fulfilled again if they have been fulfilled. Not saying they have, but if they have been fulfilled, Malachi 4 has been fulfilled. Malachi 3 has been fulfilled. It's not going to be fulfilled again. Malachi 4 is not going to be fulfilled again. All the scriptures concerning Christ, Calvary, his life, his death, his resurrection have been fulfilled. they're not going to be fulfilled again. &gt;&gt; Understand? &gt;&gt; And so there are scriptures concerning our time. And that's why it's so so very very important for us to uh to understand that this message is not just a series of books or some tapes or discs or whatever more MP3s whatever you have to listen to and and to to be casual about it because there are things this is a message for this day that came for this hour to be fulfilled in this time and to do specific things at this time. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. So I'd like to just take a sequence, a little sequence, a little overview please, of the dividing of light from darkness in our day because this what I would like to move forward to and uh uh a as I as I make my way through the message. But this this is just a rather an introduction the sequence of dividing of light from darkness in our day to bring forth our Eden. And I would like to speak on the light of Eden. The living word is a moving force. Do you believe that? It's alive with eternal life and it's moving forward even at this moment while we sit here. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; To fulfill the purpose of God's will. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Now, I'm I've got quite a number of quotes and I'm just going to take certain phrases out of the quotes. In God's provided way of dealing with sin, this is 1954 and I don't often give the dates, but it's important. I'm going to give you the dates because I'm I'm speaking of a timeline. So 1954. Now here's a prophet to a generation. So he's got to say certain things at certain times and then different things at other times. So he says in 1954, always before daylight it's the darkest. It's always darkest just before the break of day. It's because the light is oppressing and condensing the darkness. And that is at the time it that is at that time that the morning star comes out. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Now, some people might just take that as a phrase. That's not just a nice little phrase. He's saying something to the people. He's announcing something to the people that and he just takes it from the phrasing phraseology that people understand the darkest hour is before the dawn. But he's saying and he's bringing it down to the people. That's what's taking place because and the reason that happens is because the light is pressing the darkness and condensing the darkness. And at that's that time that the morning star comes out. Now then the next year 1955 in the message beginning ending of the the beginning and ending of the gentile dispensation please notice the message we see the darkness gathering now what is its light pressing against the darkness one has to give way all the creeping things that's been running through the night when that sun comes up they take to shelter when the light shines. Night dark and light cannot exist at the same time or the same building. It's either dark or it's light. And he says another place referring to God's presence. He said God is here like the light is here. says, "The light on my hand." And the two cannot exist at the same time. Regardless of how dark it might be in this room or in this building or at any place, as soon as light comes, it presses the darkness and banishes it. And darkness cannot exist where light is. in questions and answers in the Hebrews now into 1957. So we've gone seven years now uh I'm sorry 54 to 57 3 years he said you're born in the world and you come by a nature and your whole being is black and smutty and damned and cursed and going to hell. He said that's right. But when you're born again, then the light of God shines down into that soul. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And then it's no more dark. It's no more a dark valley, but it's a valley with a shadow in it. And number of times he went through the scripture to to show to the people that Psalms 23 is quoted improperly, calling it a a dark valley. No, he said it's a valley with a shadow in it. And he said, "You may be veiled here in the flesh and with things known by faith, but there's enough light in there and someday that light and darkness has to separate. And when the light shines, darkness flees." And when we go to be with Christ in that body, darkness and death vanishes and we burst into perfect light. Glory to God. There we are. No more sickness, no more dark mixed with it. &gt;&gt; 1958, now we come to my redeemer liveth. He said, in this great darkness that's swinging over the earth now is nothing but to declare that light is pressing its way down. Amen. &gt;&gt; Then in ' 64 and shalom. Now we've gone from we've gone a full 10 years from 54 to 64. The hour is upon us. [Music] Darkness, gross darkness is on the people now. That's what it is. What does all of this what does it all mean? Where are we standing? What hour are we in? How close are we to the coming? If you're not little flock, it's the father's good pleasure to give you the kingdom. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He said, "What does it mean? God has begun to separate the light from the darkness." &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. pressing it behind like he did in the beginning to show the dawn of a new day. The church ages are fading out. God is pressing the darkness into a place. It has to do it to fade out the church organizations. See how he united the two together and fade out the world. The world is covering the thing over and worldly ism has took the whole thing. Then isn't God right by worldly things and worldly dressing and worldly acting and worldly living? It's the world and ye are not of the world. Little children, &gt;&gt; you are of heaven. &gt;&gt; This is not your home. &gt;&gt; Spoke of the bright. Now this is just the overview. spoke of the bright and morning star in the man running from the presence which is in 1965 last last year brother Brandham was with us and many he said many I baptized that evening speaking of the time he was baptizing at the Ohio River he says and when they stood there when they stood there and witnessed that morning star coming down. Now notice that morning star, not the evening star, but the morning star coming down out of the heavens, cir circling around like that and said, "As John the Baptist was sent to bring forth to forrun the first coming of Christ, your message will forrun the second coming," &gt;&gt; the morning star descending &gt;&gt; and making this kind of a a statement. Then in harvest time, staying on the thought of morning star for a moment, Jesus is that morning star, &gt;&gt; the brightest of all of them. &gt;&gt; But we find him in Revelation 1 with seven stars in his hand. He interprets that and said, "These seven stars are the seven angels to the seven churches or the seven church ages that's coming." Amen. &gt;&gt; The stars that were in his hand were only the reflection stars from the morning star. &gt;&gt; You have to understand that the light the light of the messengers the light of the messenger of this age is morning star light. &gt;&gt; There is no light. He is that light. &gt;&gt; Any light that you and I have is morning star light. &gt;&gt; It's his light. It's the light of God. And that's why the scripture can say, "You are light. &gt;&gt; You're children of light. &gt;&gt; You're not of the darkness. &gt;&gt; We're not of the world. &gt;&gt; But we are in a place of shadows. &gt;&gt; Many shadows. And perhaps too many in the message live in under more shadows than they need to." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So the stars were in his hand and were only the reflection stars from the morning star. For the messenger of that of that day had the word and he and he is the word. &gt;&gt; He just had the portion for that day. &gt;&gt; And the people that's ready to come away from the world systems and world things and walk with him sees the reflection of the morning star through the messenger of that age. &gt;&gt; That's what we see. That's what we have followed. &gt;&gt; That is the light. &gt;&gt; And finally, he says they will arrive to one. And so will all so will it at the end of the church age. It will all arrive back to Jesus. That he is the word. We as Christians are only reflecting him. &gt;&gt; Amen. The light is the morning star light. And that morning star light came down saying that there will be a message that will forerun the second coming of this light. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And then in shalom and this is the last before I enter the rest of message proper. The hour is upon us. Darkness, gross darkness, gross darkness on the people. And what does it mean? Where are we standing? I know I'm repeating it. What hour are we in? How close are we to the coming? And here's the phrase I want you to bear in mind. God has begun to separate the light from the darkness, pressing it behind like he did in the beginning to show the dawn of a new day. &gt;&gt; I see the dawn of a new day. Maybe I'll show you these. And the spirit of God moved upon the face of the water and said, "Let there be light." And God separated the light from the darkness. And I believe that we are now living in that hour again. that when God is separating light from darkness and he's pressing it to the other side of the world that the light might be made manifest. Arise and shine for the glory of God has come upon you. The light is here. And then the very next verse says gross darkness is upon the people. And then when we are in a mixtury of light and darkness and then my address uh my address to the church is shalom peace. He's speaking that in the midst of mixtury of light and darkness. The world is in one of the most chaotic times of darkness that it has ever stood in. And yet it's standing in again the most blessed light that that light that it ever shined in. The gross darkness upon the people is represented in the life that they live. That's my statement that it's represented by the life they live. And then pro prophet goes on to say the reason I'd say shalom to them is because that it's God's peace. We're looking forward to the breaking of a new day until there is something great laying ahead of us. where the years has been the joy that we've looked forward to, the pressing coming of the great light. And now we can see it breaking over the horizontal realm, breaking between mortal and immortality. We see it breaking between heavens and earth, from an earthbound sickness and troubled world unto a bright shining day of an immortal life and an immortal body and an immortal earth that can never pass away. &gt;&gt; It's shalom unto the church. Now it's light time coming for the believers, but a gross darkness for the people. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; I had a beautiful dawning background to some of these because it was in the rising of the sun that he made such grand announcements of the first the first breaking in this I I'll read this for you and this service will be different I'm quite sure. He said, 'Now the sun at this rising that was at the very beginning when God said let there be light and God saw the light that it was good and divided the light from the darkness. He says, "Now the sun at this rising of the sun," he says, "well there was a time when the world was laying in utter darkness. It was without form and was void and it was all covered with water and was laying there in dark, dismal, gloomy atmosphere. And the spirit of God moved upon that water and said, "Let there be light." God had a reason for that. For down beneath the water there was seeds that he had planted and it had to have the that sunlight to make it live. &gt;&gt; And the first light was ever given to the earth was God's spoken word. &gt;&gt; The first light that ever struck the earth was God's spoken word. &gt;&gt; He said, "Let there be light." And there was light that turned darkness into light in order to bring forth a creation of joy and life upon the earth. The reason why I'm feeling something that you're not able to feel right now is because my wife and I were sitting as the prophet spoke these words. And immediately following that, we went to the baptismal tank. And I will say to you as a congregation, as I pondered this morning and prayed this morning early, we were those that were walking in the darkness of confusion. &gt;&gt; Hearing uh hearing ministry, God's one. No, God's two. No, God's three. We didn't know how to believe God. hearing. Oh, you're baptized this way. You baptize forward. You baptize backwards. You baptize in the titles. You baptize in Jesus only. You baptize. Utter confusion. Confusion happens to be darkness. &gt;&gt; Question and doubt happens to be darkness. &gt;&gt; Sickness happens to be darkness. &gt;&gt; This world outside these doors happens to be darkness. Amen. &gt;&gt; And we were in utter darkness. &gt;&gt; We were in church. &gt;&gt; I was preaching, believe it or not. But I say clearly, you cannot preach from a position of light if you're walking in darkness. And we didn't know because we didn't know, but we had sincerity. But I'm so thankful today that God said, "Let there be light." Amen. &gt;&gt; And he said that because he had a purpose because down in this earth &gt;&gt; was a seed &gt;&gt; that had to come forth. &gt;&gt; And what a blessed moment it was when we came up out of the water &gt;&gt; to rise into a resurrection &gt;&gt; of a new day &gt;&gt; that God was giving witness to and testifying because this seed must come forth. And it can only come forth by the spoken word of God. &gt;&gt; And it was God saying while a prophet spoke these words, "Let there be light." &gt;&gt; And there was light. &gt;&gt; And we came into that light. &gt;&gt; And as I came out of the water and stepped into the little room, just a handful of people, not a whole lot of people. Sister Tammy Laroo's mother and dad were there. And and I think that she was there probably also with Debbie, her sister. my family and I got into the change room was a little larger than ours. And there was another man that had just been baptized. I didn't know him. I believe it was brother Willard Collins that baptized us. I'm not sure. I think it was. And I came and I stood in the corner and the sweetest, most glorious, wonderful, quiet, serene presence of a person surrounded me. And a voice so tender, so sweet said, "Your wife is experiencing this same thing at this moment. And when we stepped out and I met her, I said, "This is what happened." She said, "That's exactly what happened to me. Let there be light." And there was light. &gt;&gt; And I declare that light today, &gt;&gt; not to shine merely in, but to cause you to be light. &gt;&gt; So that he could say, Jesus said, "You are the light of the world." We're not here to be uh uh we're not here to be uh a source of confusion. We're not here to be a source of of uh you know difficulty for people. We're here to declare the truth of the light of this message. &gt;&gt; Now, so God divided the light from the darkness. You're going to have to really pray that I'll get somewhere today because I have I'll have to take it up probably in another service. Brother Lance is going to be speaking tonight, but I don't want him to be nervous about time where we got all the time in the world. This is the Lord's day. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; It's not our day. &gt;&gt; It's not a day to shop. &gt;&gt; It's not a day to do other things. It's the Lord's day. &gt;&gt; So, we give it to him. &gt;&gt; Say, "Well, I haven't won't be able to eat." Well, don't worry about it. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; And God divided the light from the darkness which is that he he merely separated. We understand that word to make a distinction to make a difference. And I love the prophet's words. He pressed it to the other side. Light cannot remain and ruin will rain where uh darkness cannot reign where light is. Amen. &gt;&gt; But now notice please when the light that light came and to bring a glorious life of light to bring life and to bring such beauty upon the earth and the final act of God having his own son and making him God over this creation giving him this position. And now the enemy of the almighty God, Lucifer, Satan, the old serpent, the devil, whoever you want to call him, is all the same person. &gt;&gt; He's the enemy. He's cunning. &gt;&gt; He's a slicker. &gt;&gt; He knows this Bible better than you do. &gt;&gt; Don't try and get him with your intelligence. You'll never be able to do so. and he crept in under the garden wall where God had his children fortified by the word. He didn't creep in until the wife had been taken from the husband's side because she had the facility for seed. And he crept in and uh behind the garden wall and saw this masterpiece, this masterpiece family that God had for himself. And Satan found that masterpiece family. And without going into details because you understand it, he marred the family. &gt;&gt; In other words, he introduced darkness &gt;&gt; to the highest form of life &gt;&gt; that was on the earth &gt;&gt; where God, he began with a physical light in a physical darkness and darkness covered the earth. God said, "Let there be light." And there was light and life came. And then it continued and it evolved to higher species, not through evolution, but through the evolution of God creating higher species until he had his son. And he looked on it and he said, "It's good. It's very good." &gt;&gt; The scripture tells us that he created all these things for his pleasure and for his pleasure. Were they created? &gt;&gt; God enjoys his creation. And furthermore, the scripture says that God's going to destroy them who destroy the earth. &gt;&gt; This is his handiwork. He loves it. &gt;&gt; He doesn't want the creation denuted. He doesn't want mankind. He doesn't even take pleasure in the death of the wicked. He doesn't take pleasure in the fact that they're strewn over the highways because of alcohol and drunkenness and and all of the uh alcoh the drugs and whatever more. God doesn't take pleasure in that. God doesn't take pleasure that our prisons are bursting at the seams and the hospitals don't have beds. God doesn't take pleasure in that. &gt;&gt; Hello. &gt;&gt; That's why God sent healing. That's why he sent deliverance. God doesn't take pleasure in the acts of darkness. &gt;&gt; He takes pleasure in light. &gt;&gt; And in the midst of Eden's perfect light crept the enemy and introduced darkness once again. Only this was not a physical darkness. This was a spiritual darkness. &gt;&gt; And he began to bring this darkness. And the prophet said in broken sistns just to break one word plunge the human race into the into a darkness of death. &gt;&gt; Sickness is darkness. Diseases are dark is darkness. All mental orders is darkness. They got all kinds of phrases today. He said you call it cancer. But he said it's a devil. &gt;&gt; I say that cancer is darkness. speaks of a woman extremely nervous because she's shattered by death. He said that's a tumor that's malignant and that between you and I stands light &gt;&gt; life and light. &gt;&gt; Oh my. &gt;&gt; Think of it, friends. That same one that stood between that woman and that prophet, that same one is here present today, closer to you than your breath is. &gt;&gt; Do you believe that? &gt;&gt; If we don't believe it, we shouldn't be here. &gt;&gt; That's the one we come to honor. &gt;&gt; That's this morning star. &gt;&gt; That's this one who came to dispel the darkness. &gt;&gt; And there's plenty of it. It's gross darkness upon the people. Arise, shine. Your light has come. &gt;&gt; Let us be certain we walk in the light. Amen. &gt;&gt; The darkness of religion, the darkness of creed and in the message, the darkness of merely going to church. &gt;&gt; The darkness of merely having a profession, empty profession &gt;&gt; without feeling the sense. And I'm sure our Lord Jesus Christ coming uh amongst the people because he he loves to come to be honored, to be worshiped. God is in this place. I was going to sing. We're standing on holy ground. Oh, if you only knew how holy it is. &gt;&gt; We are standing on holy ground. And there's angels all around. I believe that. &gt;&gt; That has to be my anchor. &gt;&gt; I believe that with everything that's in me. If I didn't, I wouldn't even study this Bible. I wouldn't come here to preach. I wouldn't exhaust myself unless I believe that this God is present here now. He's the one who spoke back there. He's the one. And I can say a great light has dawned upon my own soul. And that's my testimony. This message brought more light. Oh, I revel in the light of the word. &gt;&gt; It's my love, my joy. Hallelujah. When all the rest of the world goes gives way, he is my He's my anchor, my satisfying portion. Amen. &gt;&gt; Religion is full of darkness &gt;&gt; even amongst believers. As I said a moment ago, it's amazing. Got a call just yesterday from far away asking some question about the message. It was so simple. I said sometime I'd like to get asked a question that had some depth to it. Like, can we do this? Can we dress this way? Or can we go to this kind of an event or this kind of a place? You know what I say? Grow up. &gt;&gt; It's time to grow up. &gt;&gt; Amen. Why do we take the message to begin with? If there is a question, don't do it. &gt;&gt; Isn't that simple? &gt;&gt; Oh, so many times we don't want to go there. But if there is a question, just don't do it. &gt;&gt; Go on the safe side. &gt;&gt; So darkness. Brother Brandham talks about the darkness of and I took quite a few of the remarks that he had made, but I won't have time to give them all. But he talks about the darkness of hope. So, and maybe so and we trust it'll be that way. Well, you say, "Well, I hope so." Well, maybe so. Or we trust it'll be that way. And now you have a brand. Now you have the title for that. Prophet called that darkness. Right. &gt;&gt; Hey, we really need to put a the light of the word upon our whole realm of &gt;&gt; our whole realm of being, our whole realm of life. &gt;&gt; And Apostle Paul said, "For we wrestle not against flesh and blood, but against principalities and against powers." We wrestle not against flesh and blood, but against principalities, against powers, against the rulers of the darkness of this world, against the rulers of the darkness of this world. So, we're not here merely resisting darkness. Our wrestling is against the rulers of the darkness. &gt;&gt; Are you with me? &gt;&gt; Are you here? Are you ready to rise to this challenge? In case you haven't thought of it before, God through the Apostle Paul is saying that we I'll put it another way. Rather than saying we wrestle not, I say we do wrestle. &gt;&gt; We wrestle against the rulers &gt;&gt; of the darkness &gt;&gt; of this world. Amen. &gt;&gt; Whenever I see anything that even afflicts a assembly or afflicts a family or an individual, young person uh uh whatever it is or my own life, I always look behind the scenes at that spirit that's trying to uh promote this thing, &gt;&gt; promote this thought, promote this fear, promote this depression. Those of you that are here and you live a depressed life and let the doctor tell you you're manic depressant. You need to look beyond that pill, you need to look beyond the thought that brings it. You need to look to the ruler [Applause] &gt;&gt; of that thing &gt;&gt; and you need to do wrestling match with the ruler with the spirit of that thing. &gt;&gt; We're not against doctors. We're not against hospitals. I thank God for them. But the sickness, the prophet said, "You call it cancer, but it's a devil." And our problem with many times when we're praying for sickness and praying for healing and praying for things, we don't get to the root of the problem. We don't deal with the ruler of that thing. &gt;&gt; I tell you ought to pull the covers off. Amen. &gt;&gt; Now, sister who may be sitting listening to me today, who I counsel with recently, it's not, you know, he said or they said or I did or they did or something else. It's who's behind the thing, &gt;&gt; who's promoting the thing? &gt;&gt; You find out it's a spirit. It's a spirit &gt;&gt; say well we have this kind of a situation that arose in our family or whatever more in our life. You should you must not just identify it with the with the circumstance of here's what happened. as I flew once about 3,000 miles to pray for a woman who was in a dire sick condition in a hospital and I came into the hospital and and she was just like a nervous conversation started to tell the doctors came they did this examination inserted this and that and had this x-ray and went on and on and on and I listened and listened listened even even I was becoming weak listening &gt;&gt; and I said to her are you son. I said, "Now you've told me what the doctors have said. Now I'll tell you why I'm here to pray for you." &gt;&gt; Right? &gt;&gt; All of those things. Well, that's fine. See, you could relate all of those things, but don't forget none of those things could bring healing in the sense of the the healing that I'm talking about. I'm talking about the healing that comes from light. &gt;&gt; Faith is light. Amen. &gt;&gt; Doubt is darkness. &gt;&gt; And these other things might be as a as a prophet speaks of also and we're well acquainted with. There is artificial light. &gt;&gt; There is reflected light. &gt;&gt; There's the light of a candle, the light of a fire. There's laser light. There's various kinds of light for different purposes. We have light here which is electricity. We've learned how to control that light. God gave us this light. We are simply managing the light. &gt;&gt; Are you with me? &gt;&gt; We have to learn also how to control the light. Amen. &gt;&gt; Sometimes you know the answer right away, but you can't it's you can't say it right away. But this I cannot emphasize if I took from now till the rest of this service on this one thing that we wrestle against the rulers of the darkness because I can tell you that whatever afflicts you as a believer, whatever afflicts you as a believer is from the kingdom of darkness. And there's various shades of shadow that may come and and and afflict us because we're in this world and we're born in this flesh. But that does not say that that nature that came with our birth is to control this life. I want to declare it's not here to control this life. &gt;&gt; I defy the enemy that tries to say that. &gt;&gt; Well, this is the way I was born. this is the way. This is just the way I am. Well, then if if if that you're continuing in that, you need to be born again, &gt;&gt; born of the spirit &gt;&gt; and born of the word, &gt;&gt; and this is the source of light. &gt;&gt; God said, "Let there be." &gt;&gt; It was God that said, "Behold, I send you Elijah the prophet." That happens to be light &gt;&gt; to this generation. &gt;&gt; That's not darkness. That's light. Amen. &gt;&gt; He said that when the God moved with compassion on the earth and made an atmosphere above and for its first time to bring joy and life to the earth by a seed that was he said that was a great hour but oh it wasn't nothing that sunrise like the sunrise on that Easter morning. This time with the sun leaping into the skies, it brought forth a greater sunrise than ever because it came greater news with the sunrise than it did at the sunrise at the beginning. There's a greater news than the one that said, "Let there be light." &gt;&gt; This sunrise brought a news that he is risen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He is quickened from the dead &gt;&gt; as he promised. He is risen from the dead. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; This sunrise brought a different kind of a statement. It brought this kind of a statement. And because I live, you shall live also. &gt;&gt; You believe that? &gt;&gt; That first sunrise didn't say that. But this sunrise did. The sen rise. &gt;&gt; And it's the sen that I'm speaking about in my own personal testimony. That's the son that rose. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; I don't feel we even had a message prior to that. &gt;&gt; Now God separating light from darkness as he did in the beginning. He divided and made a line of demarcation between the light and the darkness and the sun to rule the day and the moon to rule the night and these lights in the sky. And then Satan came, crept under the wall as the prophet said, got to the weaker vessel, had her doubt the word &gt;&gt; and darkness fell. &gt;&gt; Cain hated Abel. &gt;&gt; It's darkness. &gt;&gt; Adam also doubted. &gt;&gt; He was not deceived. and darkness fell. Such a heavy darkness and not not very long. And a man who had been given life by God and breath by God took an instrument or or his own physical strength and slew his brother Abel. And the Bible says his blood went to the ground and darkness engulfed the earth. once again only from a different source and the soul become darkened and the scripture says and tells us that Adam lost his way &gt;&gt; and there's multitudes today and perhaps even in this church today which burdens me have lost their way. How do I find how do I get how do I get back to where I was? I'm preaching so you can find your way back. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; I'm preaching to declare to you the light is here. You don't need to walk in that any longer. &gt;&gt; You need You don't need to walk half in the world and half here. You don't need to walk with question your mind. The light is here. &gt;&gt; You don't have to have that situation. You don't have to tolerate it any longer. &gt;&gt; Amen. have the enemy bamboozle you and knock you around and and drag you down &gt;&gt; and live defeated. You don't need that. &gt;&gt; He has no right to that. That's from the kingdom of darkness. I resent that and I resist that in the name of Jesus Christ for the purpose of this service. I resist that. &gt;&gt; I don't even need to ever hear from you that you had glorious. I want all the glory to go to God. &gt;&gt; If something happens, give God the glory. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And God's been separating darkness from light ever since. &gt;&gt; And that's what he did. I must hurry along. But he was separating light from darkness by bringing Israel out of Egypt when he divided them. Divided this people, even many that failed in the end. But he divided them out of Egypt and took them out of bondage, out of darkness. &gt;&gt; Bondage is darkness. &gt;&gt; You might just be bound by some simple thing. You might be bound by some pleasure. You might be bound by something in this world. You might have experienced some bondage. You might have some bondage of uh uh uh wi within your own character, within your own nature. I say you don't need to be bound to that any longer. And you must look forward to this service to be free from it. Do you hear me? In the name of Jesus Christ, I'm here to do warfare against the enemy. I'm here to announce to you, you are free because you're children of light. You're not children of darkness. that darkness has no right in your realm. [Applause] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; I'm here to wrestle against the ruler, &gt;&gt; the prince of the power of the air. &gt;&gt; I'm here to take this word and cut him free and cut you free. &gt;&gt; Bring an end to it. say, "This is over and out. I'm done." &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. I give myself. I throw myself &gt;&gt; completely. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; To our Lord Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; And God separated these people. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And when he was taken, oh, we could read it as a story. Oh, he took the children of Israel out of Egypt. No, he was separating light from darkness. And then the scripture tells us spoke to the children of Israel through Moses and said, "I have said unto you, you shall inherit the land, and I will give it to you to possess it, a land that flowth with milk and honey." Let me tell you, my dear friends, from the very depths of my soul and all the energy I have in my body, if God would do that to a physical people on a physical land, that they would have a uh their orchard in their cities and whatever more physically, how much more is that pertaining to our time? &gt;&gt; And God did not ask them, do you want it? He said, I said unto you, you shall inherit it. &gt;&gt; And I say unto you on the basis of this word, you shall inherit it. [Applause] It is yours &gt;&gt; and I will give it unto you. &gt;&gt; You shall inherit it not because you're good, not because your preacher's good, not because anything else, but you shall inherit it because I will give it to you. He said, [Music] &gt;&gt; I will give it to you. Give it to you for what? To play with. Give it to you so you have a tickle down your back. No, I will give it to you to possess it. &gt;&gt; This is your possession. &gt;&gt; This is not something where you just have a a visit and I'm just here for a short time. I'm here to I have a wonderful time this morning. Forget about that. Forget about that. Say, "The pastor preached today that I God has given this to me. He's given this deliverance to me. He's given me this freedom from this bondage. He's given it to me to possess it. It's mine. [Music] and I will have it &gt;&gt; because he has given it to me. &gt;&gt; He says, "I am the Lord your God which have separated you from other people. &gt;&gt; You didn't just stagger into this church on your own power. &gt;&gt; You've come from many, many different places or wherever you are today. You didn't stumble into the message by accident. It's by the divine call of almighty God who has a purpose in your life. And that purpose is that you become a reflector of that morning star that came down. Sent a messenger with that voice. And the messenger reflected his portion of the word. And now it's your turn. &gt;&gt; He's not coming back to reflect your part. You're going to reflect your part. Hallelujah. Every family reflects something. And you know, you don't even have to say anything. I want to I want to announce to you today and this is my absolute belief. Just by living your life every day in your community, in your area, wherever you are, just by living the life, the way that you perceive things, the way that you speak about things, the way you act, the way you drive your car, &gt;&gt; the way you conduct yourself, &gt;&gt; all speaks of light. &gt;&gt; Wonderful. Amen. &gt;&gt; You don't have to preach a sermon, but you are a sermon. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It's light. &gt;&gt; You look different. &gt;&gt; You act different. &gt;&gt; And that's why it was so much on my mind, brother Randy, when uh inspectors came and heard brother John Andy speak because they were in chapel. So they heard the whole service, the whole chapel on the rapture. They never heard anything like that. and maybe never understood anything like that. But what was it? It's light. &gt;&gt; They're affected. They don't even know why they're affected. &gt;&gt; We come out into the morning. Don't you feel better when the sun is shining? &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Vancouver, right, Pacific Northwest, whatever you are, Bellingham, Seattle. Don't we feel better when the sun shines? &gt;&gt; Oh, there's just something about it. Hear that, Lord? [Applause] Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; We love it. &gt;&gt; I love it when the sun shines. &gt;&gt; But this morning, while it may be gray outside, the sun is shining in this place. The light is here. I testify it because the messenger of God who the angel spoke to, who God spoke in a supernatural voice, your message will thorun the second coming of Christ the great light. &gt;&gt; No wonder the morning star had to introduce it. &gt;&gt; And he said the morning star and the evening star the same star. &gt;&gt; John the Baptist and this and this Elijah this time and Elijah that time is the same spirit. And he says the spirit is the Holy Ghost. It's the spirit of Christ. It's not another person. It's the same person. &gt;&gt; He's the lily of the valley, the bright and morning star. That's him. &gt;&gt; He's the only one that has a source of light. &gt;&gt; Everything else, every other star simply reflects that light. &gt;&gt; And now we're walking in that light. Oh, hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And we become that light. &gt;&gt; We're reflectors of that light. We don't have any light of our own. Amen. &gt;&gt; It's his light. &gt;&gt; Glorious light. &gt;&gt; Beautiful star Bethlehem. Shine on. Shine on. Shine on. &gt;&gt; The sun bringing forth the light of the world to press the darkness to the other side. You understand? Right from the very beginning when that darkness came into Eden, I can sees that where God deep within the recesses of that eternal being saying, "I'll press this darkness. I'll press it and I'll continue to press it. I have a plan of redemption. I'll call my elected and I'll banish this darkness from them &gt;&gt; even unto death. &gt;&gt; I'll banish this darkness. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And that's the whole program all the way through and I must follow along very quickly. And that is why in the beginning the Bible says John in John 1 and one in the beginning was the word and the word was with God and the word was God. The same was in the beginning with God. All things were made by him, and without him was nothing made that was made. In him was life, and the life was what? &gt;&gt; The light of men. &gt;&gt; Say it again. The life was &gt;&gt; the light of men. &gt;&gt; The light of humans. &gt;&gt; The life was the light. &gt;&gt; The light was striking the earth again. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; What for? to separate and press the darkness back. &gt;&gt; There never been a life like this life. There never was a man like this man. There never was one would say what he could say. &gt;&gt; Never one could say my flesh is meat indeed and my blood is drink indeed. Never one could say I lay down my own life &gt;&gt; and I take it up again. &gt;&gt; That was a morning star. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; None could say, "I am the light of the world." &gt;&gt; You know, the amazing thing, he said it twice in the scripture, and each time, the one time he said it was when the blind man born from his born from his mother's womb in darkness and had never seen the light of day. He was in a physical darkness and the spiritual darkness right in the Israel should have been full of light. But he sat in the darkness and Jesus healed him &gt;&gt; and brought light to his eyes and light to his soul. &gt;&gt; And Jesus said, "I'm the light of the world." &gt;&gt; Because he banished the darkness and pressed it back. And the other one was when the leaders came with the woman caught in the very act of adultery and said, "Moses had said she should be stoned, what sayest thou?" He stooped and write in the ground. First he said, "He that's without sin, you cast the first stone." And they one after the other left his presence because he stood and wrote in the ground. Not because the word did not say that but because they neither were they free. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; So they they witnessed it themselves when he said he that's without sin cast the first stone. &gt;&gt; True. And he wrote in the ground and they gave testimony to their own conviction that nei were condemned. &gt;&gt; Though they had never committed adultery, they were condemned and they walked out one after the other. &gt;&gt; And Jesus said after he had banished the light, the darkness from that poor woman's life. &gt;&gt; Amen. banished the darkness that gripped her and held her. &gt;&gt; He said, "I'm the light of the world." &gt;&gt; Oh, what a light. &gt;&gt; Oh, what a light. &gt;&gt; I give him glory. &gt;&gt; I give him praise. &gt;&gt; Our self-righteousness is darkness. in the rapture message. He said, let me just back up a wee bit just prior to re preach the rapture message, but I want to come to Luke 17:30. And even thus shall it be in the day when the son of man is revealed. As it was in the days of Noah. Are you listening close? &gt;&gt; In the days of Noah, darkness covered the face of the earth. Violence was everywhere. And a holy man could preach for 120 years without a congregation like we have this morning without convincing anyone to come into the ark. 120 years and after 115 I wouldn't be a bit surprised that there were times when Noah said what is my life all about? Is this just futility? the utter futility. I know that this is true. I know this is a revelation. I know that God's going to destroy the earth. &gt;&gt; But that was all part of God's plan. And he said in the end time as it was in the days of Noah and as it was in the days of Sodom, that's darkness. Gross darkness. Amen. &gt;&gt; Even thus &gt;&gt; shall it be &gt;&gt; amen &gt;&gt; in the day &gt;&gt; when the son of man is revealed. &gt;&gt; Hello friends. That's your day. &gt;&gt; That's your community. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's Vancouver, Lynden, Siri, Bellingham, wherever you're from. Seattle, that's your town. That's your That's your subdivision &gt;&gt; now. You know why I was so thankful about our school? That's the school that your kids go to. &gt;&gt; They hear vile, vulgar, filthy language every day. I'm laying it on heavy &gt;&gt; and you allow that and you pay for that &gt;&gt; not in my books. &gt;&gt; You can have your own reasoning and even your own reasoning I'll say your reasoning is darkness. &gt;&gt; Your human reasoning is not light. It's darkness. That's right. &gt;&gt; Can you even imagine somebody under the law? Can you imagine one of the old one of the old people from the law? Can you imagine them saying, "We're going to tax you and we're going to send your you're going to send your children, your sons and your daughters, and they're going to hear all that vulgarity and your daughters are going to be looked on and lusted over. and spoken about, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; And your sons are going to have to stand and look at these bare breasted young ladies that are running around with every crease in their body showing through the sling slinky garments that they wear. Say amen. &gt;&gt; You know it's the truth. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; I'd get another job if I had to &gt;&gt; to keep my kids out of that. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Tell you what, they might have put me in jail for some of the things I did, but I saw a whole group of young people right over here at at uh what's this school here on 184th? Murray something. &gt;&gt; Curry. Curry school. Right over here a couple blocks away. And I saw all these little teeny boppers and my daughter Joanne was one of them. All standing there in a circle huddled outside the school grounds on the street just on the side of the street, you know, and one of them had a cigarette in their mouth and puffing at I didn't know they were old enough to light a match. You know what I did? I jammed my brakes on, threw my car door open, and ran across that street. And they turned white. And I was white. I was so angry and I spoke to them perhaps as a man shouldn't speak to them but I don't apologize one bit I rebuke them for for out there for smoking like that today smoking what is that that's just some little ah you're you know you're from the old school I thank God for an old school I thank God for some standards I thank God for some principles &gt;&gt; and I say we need to do everything that we hand to prevent them. &gt;&gt; And then on down in their life on down the young people grow up in the 18, 19, 20 ready to get married and they've got things that they acquired. &gt;&gt; They saw &gt;&gt; they had friends. They had peers and they acquired these things &gt;&gt; where in school &gt;&gt; that you paid for them to be in. Right. &gt;&gt; Say, "Well, I teach them at home." God bless you. &gt;&gt; God bless you for that great effort. Can I take a few more minutes? &gt;&gt; See, this is all those are just optional. That's free. I know it may sting, but I'm sorry. The only thing I could do is wipe some more salt in the wound &gt;&gt; and make it sting a little bit worse. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; I'm not ashamed of the gospel of Jesus Christ. It's the power of God under salvation. &gt;&gt; We're going to just say something then you can forget it. Might be good if you don't forget it. Amen. &gt;&gt; The prophet used this word, for the word of God is quick and powerful and sharper than any two-edged sword, piercing even the dividing a sunder of soul and spirit and of the joints and marrow and as a discerner of the thoughts and the intents of the heart. Amen. &gt;&gt; I tell you what, it would cause this congregation to fall into deep condemnation if I stood here at the pullpit and spoke out what God speaks to me of individual lives while we're while I'm standing right here preaching. You'd say, "Brother Brand would say, don't think that." To be perfectly honest, I could say the same thing. &gt;&gt; Don't think that. You can feel that coming. Right. &gt;&gt; You can see whether that is a a a life looking you in the face of support or I got my own idea. I got my own thought. I'm going to say to you today because I know I'm coming from the word of God which is light and it is the kingdom of lightness and anything that wars against that is from the kingdom of darkness. Sometimes we quote things that may be out of the message and we're actually referring to the prophets echoing his exact words. He may be saying something about women. He may be saying something about ministers. But when it speaks about you women, don't you don't you allow not for one moment a little feeling of &gt;&gt; as soon as you do that comes from the kingdom of darkness. &gt;&gt; It's a shadow that's trying to move in on you. And when something is being spoken and and it and it begins to touch an area of your life, don't you for a second say, you know, and just kind of shut it off, you throw your heart wide open. &gt;&gt; Say, "Oh, light of God. &gt;&gt; Come in. Deal with that thing. &gt;&gt; May the light, May the fire of God burn it out. You want to walk out of here a different person, &gt;&gt; then I say to you to believe it in the name of Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; This God is one that separates light from darkness. [Applause] &gt;&gt; He said, "We all know we're living in a Leodysian age &gt;&gt; and those seven seals that's held the book is a mystery." When we say that I'm I'm bringing it down. I'm defining it. If it's a mystery, it's held in darkness. &gt;&gt; In other words, it hasn't come to light. &gt;&gt; If it's a mystery, you don't know anything about it. I don't know anything about it. And that's the way a a whole segment of the word was. &gt;&gt; Says that's the age we're living in. &gt;&gt; And the whole book is a mystery to people. Should be open at that day. That's what he promised. He says, "But the revelation is to reveal the truth of it." &gt;&gt; What it is to make it fit with the rest of the scriptures and then God vindicates it. That's that to be the truth. Amen. &gt;&gt; We have lived and are now living at this moment when darkness is being pressed back to the other side. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The light was the light of men. The scripture speaks of it. The light of men. The life was the light of men. The true light that lightth every man that cometh into the world. Even into the Old Testament. We the Old Testament was not a perfect light because the scripture says that the law was unable. It was not perfect because of the conscience for the conscience sake. The conscience was not cleared by the law. The man went in as a sinner and he walked out and he was still a sinner. The nature was not changed &gt;&gt; and so his conscience was not. He came in with his lamb. He did everything exactly according to the word and the high priest would go in and for forgiveness for him. But when he walked out, he still had on his conscience. His conscience wasn't clear. &gt;&gt; He still had guilt. There was no power &gt;&gt; in the animal blood to clear him of guilt. &gt;&gt; Guilt's a terrible thing. &gt;&gt; Brother Brandon dealt with it and he said it'll drive you crazy. &gt;&gt; It'll send you to the Insane Institute. &gt;&gt; Is that light? No, that's darkness. &gt;&gt; So, oh, we've got a we've got a pill. We can we can put you in some kind of other world so you're not in contact with, you know, you can't really deal with things. Put you in a psychiatric ward. I've been there. I've talked to people in there. I've prayed with them in there. &gt;&gt; I've been right down here. Not just a psychiatric ward. I was down here at Riverview when it was operating in a in where they had the hardcase insane people. I stood right there and one of the young men came out and was with us for several weeks. And the doctors called me for a meeting at the insane institution and they wanted to know what we had done to him. He was so remarkably changed. And they asked him, "Do you still have your medication?" Uh he said, "Uh uh no, I don't." Cuz the medication was long lasting medication supposed to be in his body for weeks. He said, "What did you do with it? Oh, he said I uh I flushed it down the toilet. &gt;&gt; The doctor was, you know, the psychiatrists are very very kind and very level. Okay. You flushed it down the toilet. Yeah. Yeah. I said, "Yeahhuh." They wanted me to know. So then they started asking me questions at at at at you know at uh the level that people would understand at the intellectual side and I'm not very much given over to that but I did understand what they were saying. They said do you believe in exorcism? Well I knew what that meant. So what I asked him I said what does that mean? He said that is the practice of casting out devils. Oh, I said just as Jesus did it in the Bible and I just put my back up to the Bible &gt;&gt; and I felt so comfortable. So he said, "Uh, all right. I understand." He said, "Do you believe that people can be demonpossessed?" I said, "Just as Jesus spoke of it and taught it in the Bible, that's how we believe it. said, "Okay." And I could see that and he could see that we weren't going anywhere because he could see I had a stalk answer. &gt;&gt; And the answer was just as it is in the Bible. &gt;&gt; I tell you what, if you ever get in a corner, just put that Bible behind you and lean on it. &gt;&gt; It feels so good. And then I said to him, I said, "Doctor, I understand what you're saying." I said, 'If you really want to know what we believe, this is what we believe. That before it became a physical or a mental sickness, it was first a spiritual sickness. &gt;&gt; And all the bars went down and he just said, "Oh yes." He said, "I would tend to agree with you." That was the end of the conversation. He said in five weeks they were trying to he was trying to determine how this kind of remedy improvement could happen to someone who was in such a state. They don't understand this isn't just some needle with an injection to make a person like a marshmallow. &gt;&gt; And I saw I saw a man I felt so sorry for him. Excuse me for taking this time. Great big man. and he's walking like a zombie through the place and and and and a nurse, a male nurse I think it was, are trying to get to him to throw a shot into him and he went into a rage. I didn't blame him. &gt;&gt; I didn't blame him a bit cuz he knew that wasn't doing any good for him. Just making him just a pile of mush. &gt;&gt; Oh god, &gt;&gt; there'll be a day when that darkness will leave. Amen. &gt;&gt; There will be no institutions on the other side. &gt;&gt; There'll be no hospitals on the other side. There'll be no mental disorders on the other side. There'll be no aging on the other side. As I pray this morning, oh God, let me preach with the strength of my youth today. &gt;&gt; This light is such a glorious light. &gt;&gt; Let me do justice to this light. &gt;&gt; I can say the s rose and dawned &gt;&gt; upon my life upon you that are sitting here. &gt;&gt; What about you? I thought of you from the colonies in many different colonies from different places. What was happening? God was separating you from darkness. &gt;&gt; Utter darkness. &gt;&gt; Bringing you out of that fear. Sister Kathy, &gt;&gt; bringing you out of that terrible fear. And not only that, a doctrine that is nothing but death. [Applause] We ought to be able to have a a dancing jubilee. &gt;&gt; We've been redeemed &gt;&gt; by love divine. Glory. Glory. Christ is mine. &gt;&gt; And what's happening right now? You might say, you look at your own individual life. I'll tell you what is happening. God with the light that's in you as an individual. Not because you're part of this church, but because you're part of him &gt;&gt; who is the light. &gt;&gt; He is the sen, &gt;&gt; the source of all eternal life. &gt;&gt; Because of him, his light has come into you. &gt;&gt; Do you believe that? &gt;&gt; I want to see a testimony of hands. You believe that light has come into you? All right. The reason I asked that is because God had a purpose of that light coming into you. And the purpose is to press the darkness back to the other side. And everything about your life, everything about the way you perceive things, the way you conduct yourself, everything about you is pressing that darkness back. Your neighbors feel it. &gt;&gt; Your friends feel it. &gt;&gt; The people you shop, the stores that you shop at, they feel it. You've maybe never spoken to them, but they feel it. &gt;&gt; And when it comes to the crunch, they finally say, "They're different." &gt;&gt; She's different. &gt;&gt; Not because of your hair, your long dress. You're different because it's the effect of light. &gt;&gt; And let it be known to you before I close this service, that cannot change. That's a law of almighty God. And the next time you see the sun peek through the clouds and shine down on you, I want you to remember these statement by this little preacher today that a light that's greater than that light has embodied itself in you as a believer. &gt;&gt; And the son of God, the sen has sent his own personal messenger. &gt;&gt; I can see it as it were. the morning star having five, seven stars in his hand. And the season came and he sent one out. The Apostle Paul, are you with me? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He's saying, "Separate the light from the darkness. Take them from law to grace. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Take them from law to grace. &gt;&gt; Go out, messenger. Go out with this light. &gt;&gt; Speak this word. I'll reveal myself to you. That great light he saw on the road to Damascus came and inhabited him. &gt;&gt; Oh, congregation, do you hear me? out in the fellowship room. Do you hear me? And God sent one after the other after the other till finally the last one came. &gt;&gt; The last one in his hand, the one that was very close to him. &gt;&gt; That was Elijah. The spirit of Elijah. &gt;&gt; It's different from the rest. &gt;&gt; I'll tell you why it's different from the rest. Because when John the Baptist came, they want to know, are you the Messiah? &gt;&gt; It's so close. &gt;&gt; Said no, I'm not the Messiah. Are you that prophet? No. Are you Elias? He said no. He didn't lie. He knew they were looking for Elias of Malachi 4 and he wasn't that. &gt;&gt; He knew there was a f a further fulfillment of his ministry &gt;&gt; of his spirit that was on him. &gt;&gt; And then when Jesus came, they said John has risen. &gt;&gt; Cuz they always were confusing those two spirits, &gt;&gt; the spirit of Elijah and the spirit of Christ. And that is why it is no surprise to me when the prophet of God comes in this day, they said is this he's he's a he's Christ. This is Jesus is is the Lord. Because it could not in the human mind separate those two. And the reason why friends listen close now because the light that was shining through is Christ. &gt;&gt; The light that's shining through is &gt;&gt; the bright and morning star. Amen. &gt;&gt; It is him. &gt;&gt; So when you focus on that, you know, it's just hard to separate the flesh. And that's why he said it's so hard for you to get that separated. &gt;&gt; But there is a line. &gt;&gt; And finally, that last one. &gt;&gt; You've seen the seven church ages. I'm closing now. You've seen the seven church ages. Go and look at them. And when you see the last one, it's Le Oysia. And brother Brandham said there's just a little sliver of light. He said he left that there, but actually it goes into total darkness. &gt;&gt; That's your home. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; That's your home. &gt;&gt; That's where you live. That's where this church is. This is our civilization. &gt;&gt; I don't personally identify it, but that's where we're at. &gt;&gt; And so when you see this thing going this way and this war over here and this uprising, when you see a million people in the Congo now running for their lives with everything on their back and everything on their head, everything they own, little children, I saw little boys like you with huge huge loads on their head. Little fellas just like you. Little girls. Not a 100 years ago, yesterday. &gt;&gt; Right. If you wish, you can get on a plane and be there in a few hours and be in the same environment &gt;&gt; and wonder for your own life. &gt;&gt; Because we sit here in this relative peace and rest, it doesn't mean that we're not part of the human community. We are. &gt;&gt; And there's preachers and believers of this message that's in that very area. It's darkness. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I don't know about you friends, this is not some emotional thing, but something tugs very very deep in my heart. They don't need you to run over there and and and and just try to do something. That's not why I'm preaching. We're the best thing we can do is send a light. &gt;&gt; That's why I'm possessed. absolutely obsessed with getting the message out. &gt;&gt; They don't need me. They need the prophet's word. &gt;&gt; They need that message. &gt;&gt; If I never preach another message in this church, don't forget these words. The people out there need the light of this message. &gt;&gt; That's why I'm for translating it in every possible language. It's not a bunch of mechanics. It's the light that comes to their being &gt;&gt; in hearing it and seeing it in their own tongue. &gt;&gt; You think that's just been a personal view? That's not a personal view. That's the word of God. What would have happened if Paul simply wrote letters in the in the prison where he was for a couple of years and and and in bonds and with a few people in a house and he wrote letters to the Corinthians and Philippi the Philippians and the Colossians and so on so forth. I tell you those letters were were they were treasured and they were translated other language and they were sent abroad with runners and and writers and whatever more so that other people could have it. I'm glad I don't know who but I'm glad it reached my hands &gt;&gt; and the purpose of his life was to turn the corner from lot of grace. I'm glad I heard about grace. But this last messenger closing, help me close &gt;&gt; this last messenger. I I'm just wondering. I'm just wondering when I cross on the other side. I'd like to find out. Did you deliberate, Lord Jesus? Did you deliberate? Did you think about this in your thought in the great plan of God? There'd come a day, there'd come a precise time when the world was moving forward in such scientific advancement, when the world would become almost a global village. Just as it's moving in that direction, it's coming into absolute darkness. I'll send my last one with the spirit of Elijah. Go. Here he comes. Doesn't know how to pray. Writes a prayer on a note. Tacks it on a tree. What is this strange feeling? As I said to the young couple getting married yesterday, he says to his young wife, "I've got to find out what this is about. I've got to I've got to get an answer. I've got to find out. And if I don't find out, I won't be back. And he's in his place of prayer and he says in his testimony, I heard footprints coming bare feet. you that were at the ceremony yesterday don't know how my heart was touched. I said, "Oh, God, I'm so glad he heard those footsteps." &gt;&gt; I'm so glad he received that man, that angel that toll of his ministry because of that light has come to this poor heart &gt;&gt; and soul of mine. And that light is here this morning. He is here. I've talked about him and a messenger said every time you do he comes. The one of whom I speak is present in this place today. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Lord Jesus, I just want to close I want to close with these words. I love you. Thank you for coming. Thank you for sending such a true voice for the light that has shone. Lord, I'm here before this congregation of people. Thank you for the light that came to my wife and myself. And it was so gripping. It was so compelling. We simply want to lay our life down and do what we could so that others might hear. And I pray Lord, I'm asking that this morning with this congregation of people and those that are out in perhaps other lands and those that are streaming the service that are one with us in this meeting out in the fellowship room. Lord, would you somehow touch them with a divine touch? Someone may be in deep question, deep quandry. Someone may still be in darkness. Someone is still in the clutches of the enemy and they've not free from sin. They're not free from the old life. Lord, I ask that you would. Lord, you know yourself what went through my heart and through my mind, my thoughts. As I studied, I thought of those that once were here, once were in fellowship, [Music] once were walking in harmony and close to you and desired you to live in them richly. And I think of where they are today. They wouldn't deny a prophet. They wouldn't deny a message. They wouldn't deny you, Lord Jesus. because they wouldn't deny Calvary or the resurrection, but for some reason the world and the darkness of the world and the shadows of Leodia have taken such a controlling place in their life and they're not here. I pray you'll send, oh God, your voice somehow. Send someone from this place. Send a messenger, oh God, to them. Send a sister to someone, oh Lord, to another sister. Send a brother, oh God, out and speak. I pray, Father, in the name of Jesus Christ. And may people realize, oh God, this is not just merely a church, but this is a body of the elect of Jesus Christ. This elect body of the bride of Jesus Christ. Lord, I give you thanks for that. Just to be considered as a part of your body. We thank you, Lord. Let's all stand, shall we? [Music] Wonder if we could sing just a chorus first. I have a father. Could you mic please the piano? Can you help me with the um just start singing please? [Music] Oh, and you never [Music] go. [Music] Heat. Heat. [Music] Oh, I [Music] [Music] even Heat. Heat. He sees his &gt;&gt; I have a father. &gt;&gt; Isn't that lovely? Thank you. [Music] Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. knows my name. Thank you. He knows my name. He knows your name. He knows my everyone. He me sing. It is well with my soul. It is well with my soul. The anthem of this church. I want you to look at every line. If you can say it in truth, sing it. If you can't, then just hold your peace by it and say, "Why can't I say that? Why can't I sing that?" Do not sing it as a song. Sing it in truth because truth is life &gt;&gt; and truth is light. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Listen to me congregation gathered here and wherever you might be. &gt;&gt; The words of my Lord Jesus. You are the light of the world. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And when our Lord Jesus said that, that was such a incredible statement for one man. One man, without technology, without the travel, modern travel to stand perhaps in a pair of sandals on sand, searing hot sand, and say, "I am the light of the world." Amen. &gt;&gt; He knew who he was. &gt;&gt; And he knew what was in him. &gt;&gt; Yes. Amen. &gt;&gt; And you must know those two things today. &gt;&gt; You must know who you are. &gt;&gt; And you must know what is in you. Amen. &gt;&gt; And if something impedes that, if Satan has tried to encroach upon that and bring such deep shadows, I will banish them today by the power of the word of God. &gt;&gt; If you haven't got that liberty, you may want to come and stand here at the front. And there's ministers here that'll pray with you. Not you just want a closer walk with God. Not that. Just deal with that where you are. just want to rededicate your life, just deal with that where you are. If you've had some enemy that has held and you need a total deliverance, God is prepared to not only deliver you, but remember, please remember this congregation. Stay with me in the end of this congregation, at the end of this service. What we need and what we desire is that God will eliminate and remove the shadows. out of a person's life that they might indeed be able to say with a witness within themselves. Jesus said, "I am the light of the world." &gt;&gt; And may that light emanate and permeate out &gt;&gt; of every area &gt;&gt; of a person's life, &gt;&gt; name of Jesus Christ. I want everybody to say with me, in the name of Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; In the name of Jesus Christ. In the name of Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; In the name of Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; Let the light shine. &gt;&gt; Let the light shine. &gt;&gt; Let the power of the enemy be broken. &gt;&gt; Do you believe it? &gt;&gt; Let us say also, the light is here. &gt;&gt; The light is here. &gt;&gt; Christ, you are here. &gt;&gt; That's the truth. [Music] &gt;&gt; Ministers, if you would come, &gt;&gt; we're going to sing Christ. It is well with my soul. When peace like a river plays. and peace. [Music] My way of God Heat. Heat. [Music] Oh my well with my soul. &gt;&gt; Before we sing this next verse, we'll be happy if the if the deacons will come and join us also, please. Hallelujah. And you that are there standing there, you're a believer. &gt;&gt; Take a hold of the promise of God, &gt;&gt; friends. I want to see something of an eternal nature take place today here in this congregation. Am I asking too much? &gt;&gt; Am I asking too much? &gt;&gt; No. &gt;&gt; The light is here. Let that light then move. &gt;&gt; Let that light sever bondage. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Deacons, please come and help us if you would please. [Music] &gt;&gt; And you that are here, you pray. You that are here, you call out. You that are here, look for an answer &gt;&gt; in the name of Jesus Christ. Loat. [Music] [Music] Yeah. Heat. Oh, well it is well with my soul.

Everyone, you have someone on your heart. Let's call on God and just pray that there'll be a mighty manifestation of the power of the Holy Spirit. I look to you to pray wherever you are. Just reach out to God. Oh father, I join with this whole congregation of people. We are praying to a living God. A God who hears us when we pray. A God who answers because you love to answer. You love to give it to your people to give them every good gift. Oh God, give deliverance where deliverance is needed. Father, some of these have been bound. Some of these have been hindered. Some of these have been sitting in the shadows of darkness. Let that darkness leave now, Father, in Jesus Christ's name. Banish the darkness. Banish the confusion in the name of Jesus Christ. Banish, oh God, every spirit that is hounding them, every contrary thing, oh God, and let them step out into the glorious light. And may they claim the promise as I walk in the light as I walk in the light as he is in the light that I have fellowship. Oh God, fill them with the Holy Spirit, the Holy Spirit of light and truth. Lead them, oh guide. Oh lead them, oh heavenly guide. Lead them, I pray. Shepherd, shepherd of the flock, lead them. Do this marvelous thing amongst us, oh God. May this be, may this be the hour, oh God, when the Holy Ghost falls upon the people, from the pulpit, oh God, to the pew, out into the fellowship room and the balcony, oh God, out in the streaming land, I pray. Oh, fill a house, fill a place, fill a room, oh God, name of Jesus. In the name of Jesus, let that name be glorified. Let that name be glorified. Let that name be lifted up. Let that name be praised.
