[9:57] Lord, you look after all of our needs,
[9:59] Lord.
[10:00] Oh, we worship you this evening, oh God.

[10:06] oh God.
[10:08] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Hallelujah to your name,
[10:10] Lord. Praise your name, Lord.
[10:14] In this presence, we're going to go to
[10:16] prayer and ask brother Tony. Believe you
[10:18] have a prayer request that you want to
[10:20] relate if you would come at this time.
[10:23] Give it. We don't have any prayer cloths
[10:25] up here, but if you have a need on our
[10:26] heart as brother Tony goes a prayer,
[10:28] just lift it to our Lord. Amen.
[10:34] We just want to rejoice with the saints
[10:36] in China that were released, the
[10:37] brothers when they heard that so many
[10:39] around the world have been praying for
[10:41] them. They just broke down and wept.
[10:43] Amen. It touches hearts and lives when
[10:45] we pray. We also would just invite you
[10:48] as uh on behalf of our family to join
[10:51] with us in prayer. Rebecca's sister, her
[10:53] older sister Shirley, her husband uh has
[10:56] been admitted to uh South Africa. They
[10:59] were in the country of Zambia for some
[11:01] mission work that they were filling in
[11:03] for and her husband Shirley's husband
[11:05] Lauren. He uh he's got an infection and
[11:08] it ended up causing an abscess upon his
[11:11] brain. And so he's in a very serious
[11:13] condition. There's an abscess there.
[11:14] They've done an operation a week ago and
[11:17] they had to take him in for another
[11:18] emergency operation uh just um about 6
[11:21] hours ago. So you know how it is when
[11:24] one of your family members is suffering.
[11:27] We appreciate you joining our hearts
[11:28] together with us. Can we do that?
[11:31] Heavenly Father,
[11:33] we do live to worship you for you've
[11:36] done so much for us. Lord, we live our
[11:40] lives, Lord, sacrificing our own desires
[11:44] in order that we could worship you in
[11:46] the spirit of holiness and the way we
[11:48] live, the manner of conversation that we
[11:51] have, Lord, because of our love and our
[11:53] gratitude and our appreciation. Lord,
[11:56] for when we were vile, lost sinners
[11:58] living unto ourselves, Lord, you didn't
[12:00] look at our flesh. You didn't look at
[12:02] our weaknesses, our our faults and
[12:05] failings. You look beyond that to the
[12:07] lamb's book of life. Lord, there you saw
[12:09] our names written there in the lamb's
[12:12] blood. Hallelujah. And father, here we
[12:14] are tonight, Lord, your chosen bride.
[12:17] Here we are tonight, oh God, as as ones
[12:19] that have been on placed on earth in the
[12:22] ministry to stand in the gap, a ministry
[12:24] of reconciliation for those that are in
[12:27] need of salvation, in need of healing,
[12:29] in need of deliverance. And Lord, we
[12:31] bring our requests before you. And we
[12:34] ask abundantly that our joy may be full.
[12:37] For we know that you delight, Lord, in
[12:39] seeing your children blessed. We know
[12:42] that you, Lord, bore those stripes in
[12:44] your body in order that you could prove
[12:46] you're greater than sickness, greater
[12:48] than abscess, greater than cancer.
[12:50] Hallelujah. And so, Father, once again
[12:53] tonight, Lord, with the faith that
[12:54] you've given to us and Lord, recognizing
[12:57] and knowing who we are, we come boldly,
[13:00] Father, as your wife, as your bride,
[13:02] Lord, asking on behalf of those that are
[13:04] in need. And Lord, we have this need in
[13:07] our family. And Lord Jesus, we're
[13:09] asking, Lord, that whatever's been
[13:11] spoken, Lord, that it would be forgiven,
[13:14] Lord. whatever action that may have been
[13:16] taken, Lord, that might have been
[13:17] contrary to your word. Father, we pray
[13:19] for mercy, Lord, we stand, Lord, in the
[13:22] gap for Shirley and Lord, at this hour
[13:25] that you would move in a in a sovereign
[13:27] way in that hospital in Johannesburg,
[13:29] Lord, and move over that bed and Lord,
[13:32] bring a healing and a strength to his
[13:34] body. And Lord, more importantly than
[13:36] that, that there would be a recognition
[13:38] of your presence in this last days.
[13:40] Lord, for we realize the hour that we're
[13:43] living in and how short it is. And Lord,
[13:45] we're applying that token once again for
[13:47] our families tonight. And Lord, we know
[13:50] that there's many extended families in
[13:52] this assembly. And by way of internet
[13:54] that are listening tonight, we pray,
[13:56] Father, that you would move on our loved
[13:58] ones hearts. Move on those that are away
[14:01] from you, even in this assembly. And so,
[14:03] Father, we ask thy will to be done as we
[14:06] ask it according to thy word now. And
[14:08] father, as we turn our hearts to the
[14:10] word, Lord, that feeds our souls, that
[14:13] lifts us up in a heavenly places, Lord,
[14:15] may there just be a move of your spirit
[14:17] over our pastor tonight. Lord, may we
[14:19] just be elevated once again and leave
[14:21] this place, a a happier people, a a
[14:24] victorious people because of the word
[14:26] that has fed our souls. Bless the red
[14:28] tonight as we ask all these mercies in
[14:31] Jesus name we pray. Amen.
[14:36] &gt;&gt; Amen. You may have your seats.
[14:45] Amen. You love the Lord. Praise God. I

[21:39] power.
[21:40] &gt;&gt; Amen. Thank you for your prayers. Your
[21:43] prayers gave us power.
[21:46] &gt;&gt; We had a wonderful time at Brother
[21:49] Donnie Reagan's church and congregation
[21:52] there and those that came in from many
[21:55] different places. We were really happy
[21:57] to to uh
[22:00] join with them. And at this Thanksgiving
[22:03] time, first time I've ever been there at
[22:04] Thanksgiving time. And some came from oh
[22:08] from Florida and different states around
[22:11] North Carolina and South Carolina, I
[22:13] guess, different places. We're just real
[22:16] happy to be with them. And it was nice
[22:18] to have some of our own congregation.
[22:20] Brother Ernie, Sister Katie were there
[22:22] and brother Hank. Amen. It was nice to
[22:25] see him. Brother Jake Dick came and and
[22:29] uh I was able for the first time
[22:31] probably in 20 years we I was able to
[22:35] have my daughters with us and uh that
[22:38] was very special and Dave uh also was
[22:42] able to be with Marilyn. So it was just
[22:44] very very special and uh you know it's
[22:48] uh when you when you raise a family it's
[22:51] it it is nice to get to be together once
[22:54] in a while and sometimes it's it's hard
[22:56] when everybody's kind of involved in the
[22:58] ministry one way or another. It's just
[23:00] difficult to get together, but it was
[23:03] was just really really nice and
[23:05] especially for uh I knew that you were
[23:08] praying and uh I knew that God was
[23:10] blessing also in the congregation. I
[23:13] already heard the church was packed
[23:15] Sunday morning and like nobody was away
[23:18] here. A few Sundays ago, I I happened to
[23:21] know that there was quite a few people
[23:23] away, probably as many as 20. And I
[23:25] thought, well, there'll be a little bit
[23:27] of room in the church. I I came to
[23:29] church and it was just absolutely
[23:32] squeezed tight. I thought, "Well, my
[23:35] where did all these people go?" I said
[23:37] something to someone. They said, "Well,
[23:38] it was just the people sitting in the
[23:39] fellowship room got into the sanctuary
[23:42] finally." So, God bless you for coming
[23:45] early and being here and for praying and
[23:48] and everything that's taking place.
[23:50] Thank you for your prayers for during
[23:52] the prayer meeting and for the young
[23:54] people and for what's taking place. and
[23:57] brother John Andy's been going through
[23:58] the seals with them and and I'm going to
[24:01] try to get in one of those meetings,
[24:02] brother John for sure. In January, as
[24:04] you suggested and and uh praying for the
[24:07] camp, the brothers that uh you may
[24:10] wonder what uh you know what took place.
[24:12] We made an announcement and brother
[24:14] Chris Peterson took their names and uh
[24:18] the names of all the people and he was
[24:21] you know quite persistent, you know,
[24:23] because I just stood up to see how he's
[24:25] doing. He says, "Well, write your name
[24:26] down." So, I was number 27. I haven't
[24:29] been out there yet, but I I keep getting
[24:32] the daily uh progress reports and said
[24:35] the brothers that have been out there
[24:37] just uh have been having a great time. I
[24:40] know, brother Jack, you were out there.
[24:43] They liked it. Some of the brothers
[24:44] liked it so well. I heard that they, you
[24:46] know, uh just made a nice wood fire and
[24:48] made them all comfortable and they said,
[24:50] "I think we'll just stay till tomorrow."
[24:51] And then they want to stay day after
[24:53] day. It must be good food and really a
[24:56] welcome spirit out there. So, you that
[24:59] have uh uh have uh put your name down,
[25:02] you're you're going to enjoy your time
[25:05] out there. And uh and we want to pray
[25:07] about that, too, because it's a
[25:09] spiritual it's a spiritual work. We're
[25:11] not there just, you know, for or uh uh
[25:15] you know, just to spend time, but it we
[25:17] we're looking forward to God using it.
[25:20] Amen. He can use your car. He can use
[25:22] your house.
[25:23] &gt;&gt; He can use everything. Do you believe
[25:25] that?
[25:26] &gt;&gt; Amen. And he does. We're thankful to God
[25:29] for that. Uh I'm going to have you stand
[25:31] and I'd like to sing. We worship you in
[25:34] spirit and in truth. If you just lift up
[25:37] your voices and sing with me. I just
[25:40] feel like I'd like to worship him
[25:41] tonight. Wouldn't that be a good thing
[25:42] to do on Wednesday? Amen.
[25:46] [Music]
[25:48] We worship you
[25:53] in spirit
[25:55] and in truth.
[25:58] [Music]
[26:01] We
[26:03] worship you in spirit
[26:08] and in truth.
[26:14] We have heard your word and felt your
[26:19] presence.
[26:24] [Music]
[26:25] We worship you
[26:29] in spirit
[26:31] and in truth. We're going to sing it
[26:35] once again. And while we sing it, if you
[26:38] know it, you could just close your eyes
[26:41] and look up to him. If you feel like
[26:43] lifting your hand, that's fine. But
[26:46] above all things, let's lift up our
[26:48] hearts. Let's lift them up with yielding
[26:51] by yielding to the Holy Spirit. And the
[26:55] words which said, "And I felt your
[26:57] presence too." If we have not felt his
[27:01] presence, I'd suggest we ask, invite him
[27:05] tonight. Would you do that? Say, "Lord,
[27:08] let me sense and feel your presence. I
[27:12] invite you to come and minister to me
[27:14] personally. We're not here just to put
[27:17] in time, but we're here to hear
[27:19] something.
[27:21] Living word. Amen. Hallelujah. Can you
[27:25] say amen?
[27:25] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[27:26] &gt;&gt; That's good. That's good. Let's just
[27:28] enter in now. We worship you.
[27:34] Yes, Lord. In spirit, in
[27:39] truth.
[27:42] Oh, hear us Lord.
[27:44] &gt;&gt; We worship you in spirit
[27:49] and
[27:55] we have heard your word
[28:00] and help your
[28:03] true.
[28:07] We worship you
[28:12] in spirit
[28:13] and in truth.
[28:18] Now with our heads and hearts bowed as
[28:20] we approach your word, oh loving father.
[28:25] You love your children.
[28:28] You have called us to this place. We
[28:30] have come to worship you in spirit and
[28:33] in truth. And we worship you now, Lord,
[28:36] by opening our hearts to your word. And
[28:39] let the Holy Spirit speak. Let the Holy
[28:42] Spirit be the minister tonight, oh God.
[28:45] Minister to my heart. Minister to every
[28:48] heart. And I pray, Father, those that
[28:51] may not be hungry, create within them a
[28:53] hunger. Create within us a thirst. Oh
[28:56] God, create within us that desire. May
[28:59] the desire be so intense. Let it be a
[29:02] flame burning embers within our soul,
[29:06] Lord God. And we want to let you know
[29:08] nothing can satisfy us in this world. We
[29:11] say take the whole world and give us
[29:13] Jesus. Give us the Lord Jesus. Oh, a
[29:17] living Christ, not a Christ of history,
[29:20] not a Jesus of history, but one that is
[29:23] now alive and resurrected amongst his
[29:27] people, Jesus Christ in bride form. I
[29:30] pray Lord you'll just let your anointing
[29:33] now Father flow through us and into us
[29:36] in Jesus Christ's name. Amen.
[29:40] &gt;&gt; Amen. I'll have you uh turn in your
[29:43] Bibles if you would to Ephesians
[29:46] the first chapter. Very very common
[29:50] portion of scripture for those of us
[29:53] message believers.
[29:55] But it's wonderful words, precious
[29:57] words.
[29:59] uh uh in Ephesians 1,
[30:01] we're going to start at the third verse
[30:04] and just read down to verse seven.
[30:10] Blessed be the God and Father of our
[30:13] Lord Jesus Christ, who hath blessed us
[30:16] with all spiritual blessings in heavenly
[30:19] places in Christ, according as he hath
[30:22] chosen us in him before the foundation
[30:25] of the world, that we should be holy and
[30:28] without blame before him in love, having
[30:32] predestinated us unto the adoption of
[30:35] children by Jesus Christ to himself.
[30:37] self according to the good pleasure of
[30:40] his will,
[30:42] to the praise of the glory of his grace,
[30:45] wherein he hath made uh wherein wherein
[30:48] he hath made us accepted in the beloved,
[30:53] in whom we have redemption through his
[30:55] blood, the forgiveness of sins according
[30:58] to the riches of his grace. You know,
[31:02] we've read just a few verses. I don't
[31:04] know if you have ever marveled, but I
[31:07] have many, many times, frequently as I
[31:10] read the scripture and especially
[31:13] reading uh Apostle Paul's writings.
[31:16] They're not merely profound, but there's
[31:19] no excess words. They're so potent, just
[31:23] potent with life. And I marvel because
[31:27] how even God I know it's God speaking
[31:30] through a man but how God could get
[31:32] control of a man so he can be so precise
[31:35] with his thoughts and lay the word down
[31:37] like that. And I can tell you you can
[31:39] read these four or five verses which we
[31:41] read and there isn't any excess words.
[31:43] Every word is just absolutely pregnant
[31:46] with life. It's marvelous. God help us
[31:49] as we continue on this evening. You have
[31:51] your seats please.
[31:55] I want to take this phrase
[31:59] which I have pondered on many times
[32:02] and I felt inspired to it this week
[32:06] while I was away
[32:08] to the praise of the glory of his grace
[32:12] wherein he hath made us accepted in the
[32:14] beloved. And I would like to speak to
[32:17] you this evening. Uh and I trust that
[32:20] God will just help me and give me uh
[32:24] continuity of thought. I would like to
[32:27] speak on uh accepted in the beloved.
[32:32] Uh I thought on the subject this
[32:35] generation in particular,
[32:38] we are uh we are sometimes at least I
[32:42] feel almost bombarded by society itself
[32:47] with a pressure and an imposition
[32:51] placed upon us to accept what others uh
[32:56] what what they want to believe, how they
[32:58] want to live. And it's it it seems that
[33:01] they're not satisfied to simply go on,
[33:05] do your own thing, live your own life,
[33:07] but they're not satisfied with that.
[33:09] They want you to accept
[33:11] &gt;&gt; what they do, how they speak, how they
[33:14] live, how they conduct themselves, what
[33:17] their sexual orientation is or whatever
[33:19] else. They might want to believe some of
[33:22] the craziest things in the world, but
[33:24] they and I just say, "Go ahead and
[33:26] believe it. Go do your thing. live your
[33:28] life however you feel to do it. Just go
[33:31] your way, you know, leave me alone. But
[33:33] no, no, no. They want you to accept it.
[33:36] &gt;&gt; It's an age of acceptations. If that if
[33:39] that makes any sense to you, they want
[33:41] you to accept it.
[33:43] &gt;&gt; However, you know, however it is. and
[33:46] whatever whatever level of uh uh of life
[33:52] whatever level of of you know manner of
[33:56] life that that they have and I don't
[33:58] want to go into details with that
[33:59] because I want to move on from that but
[34:02] we are certainly in that kind of an age.
[34:05] I talked to a woman in the bank today
[34:09] and I I just passed this over the pulpit
[34:11] a few days ago, but I just said to her,
[34:14] I said, you know, if you think about
[34:16] things for a little bit, I said, you'll
[34:18] you'll find that they they know well
[34:20] about the church here and everything and
[34:22] the people here. But I said, if you
[34:23] think about things for just a wee bit
[34:25] and and let this thought distill for a
[34:28] moment, boil it down. I said you you'll
[34:31] find that uh uh the criminals today are
[34:36] really
[34:37] imposing their lifestyle
[34:40] upon the government to such an extent
[34:43] that the government write laws to
[34:46] accommodate them and you pay the bill.
[34:50] &gt;&gt; That's really what it is
[34:52] &gt;&gt; in a lot of ways. in a lot of ways and I
[34:54] could go into some details and you just
[34:56] find out that uh I I went to do a little
[34:59] bank transaction day and they said well
[35:01] we can't do that anymore
[35:03] and I and and I had just trying to do a
[35:06] little small bank transaction across the
[35:08] border and I I I I couldn't do it down
[35:10] there. They said no we've centralized
[35:12] we've centralized the whole thing. They
[35:14] said, you know, it's this it's this
[35:16] money laundering thing here. I'm trying
[35:18] to, you know, get a check uh on one side
[35:21] of the border and bring it on the other
[35:23] side of the border. Just a a a measily
[35:26] insignificant transaction, but it can't
[35:29] do it because it's all done now in some
[35:31] big central uh bank uh at head office
[35:35] and you we can't give you a cashier's
[35:37] check in Canadian funds. Uh none of the
[35:40] branches can do that anymore. you've got
[35:42] to uh so I had to speak to a uh one of
[35:45] the uh executives and say h how can I do
[35:48] this then? I just need this in Canadian
[35:50] funds and bring it back across the
[35:52] border and and uh put it in another
[35:55] account and a personal account and take
[35:57] it out into another kind of a a
[36:00] certified check and finally I got the
[36:01] thing took me a couple of hours to do
[36:03] something that would have taken about
[36:05] five minutes. So I talked to the girl in
[36:07] the bank and I said you know she said
[36:08] well you know it's all this money
[36:10] laundering thing. I said, "Isn't it
[36:11] amazing that the these guys that are
[36:13] these criminals are imposing upon you to
[36:17] write laws that make it so hard for us
[36:20] citizens to live and all these drug
[36:23] dealers and all these pot growers are
[36:26] causing the government to write laws and
[36:29] impose uh and confine us and restrict us
[36:33] and also make us pay the bill.
[36:36] &gt;&gt; We have to pay the bill." So, in
[36:38] essence, they're writing the law.
[36:39] They're telling the politicians what to
[36:41] say. And yet on the other hand, they
[36:44] want to be accepted. They want you not
[36:46] only pay the bill, they want you to
[36:48] accept it.
[36:50] This is the way it's going to be. Well,
[36:52] I can tell you that is exactly the way
[36:54] it's going to be because that's how the
[36:55] world is going to go. It's going to go
[36:57] that direction. That has very little to
[36:59] do with my message, but I thought I'd
[37:00] just throw that out.
[37:06] There's something
[37:08] uh within I say the human psyche that
[37:12] wants to be accepted.
[37:15] We we we feel we need identification.
[37:18] Young people do. They want to be and and
[37:20] if a person's not accepted or is denied
[37:25] being accepted, it's a hardship. You
[37:28] believe it or not, it is a hardship.
[37:29] Some people say, "I'm a loner. It
[37:31] doesn't mean a thing to me." Oh, yeah.
[37:33] No, no. I know some of those people that
[37:35] are loners. They they want they need to
[37:37] be identified with somebody more than
[37:38] anyone else. They need to be identified
[37:41] with somebody. They want to be
[37:42] identified with somebody, some group or
[37:44] something. And there's always uh uh
[37:46] there's always something that uh
[37:49] attracts people to, you know, they get
[37:51] into the big crowd, whether it's a
[37:53] sports crowd or whether it's a religious
[37:55] crowd. But people, there's something
[37:57] within the human frame, a human inner
[38:00] person that needs to be accepted. Now,
[38:04] there's a key phrase here that I want to
[38:07] uh uh start my message by dwelling on
[38:10] this for just a moment. And it says that
[38:13] hath he hath made made us
[38:18] accepted in and that little word
[38:21] two-letter word in the beloved is a key
[38:25] word.
[38:29] He hath made us accepted
[38:32] in the beloved. Outside of that there's
[38:35] no assurance of being accepted but in
[38:38] the beloved. And the little word in
[38:41] which you may, you know, you may feel
[38:43] that you you well know it and that this
[38:46] is a a very elementary Sunday school
[38:50] class, but it's really not because the
[38:53] word in it speaks of or denotes that the
[38:56] object,
[38:58] now we're speaking about you as the
[39:00] object is surrounded by or included in a
[39:05] specific place
[39:08] and that you are enveloped
[39:11] or you are restrained by certain limits.
[39:15] And anyone that's in Christ is enveloped
[39:19] and restrained or constrained by certain
[39:22] limits. There are things that we can't
[39:24] do. Not because not because God is
[39:27] saying you can't do it, but because we
[39:30] don't have a desire to do it because we
[39:33] are we have certain constraints. We have
[39:36] certain limitations and those come to us
[39:39] because of the mere fact that we are
[39:42] living in we are living in Christ and
[39:45] Christ is the word and the word isn't
[39:47] thou shalt thou shalt not. Brother
[39:49] Brandham goes into his marriage
[39:51] relationship
[39:53] and refers to uh his own relationship
[39:56] with his wife. And when he goes
[39:58] overseas, she doesn't grab him by the
[40:00] tie and tell him what to do. And he
[40:03] doesn't tell her, you know, what to do.
[40:05] He doesn't have to point to some, you
[40:07] know, piece of paper on the wall, say,
[40:09] "We're married and you have to live a
[40:11] certain way." That's he said, "That'd be
[40:13] a terrible marriage."
[40:15] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? That wouldn't be right
[40:17] at all. But because they're being
[40:20] dictated to, in other words, he says, "I
[40:22] fear my wife." He said in other place,
[40:24] he fears them. He has a certain not a
[40:27] fear of being a scared, but a fear of of
[40:29] the sanctity of the marriage union.
[40:33] There's a sanctity to it. And so, there
[40:35] are certain restraints. There are
[40:37] certain restraints of us living in
[40:39] Christ. And we're not only constrained
[40:43] of you can't, you can. That's not the
[40:45] point. The point is I'm glad for those
[40:48] constraints. I'm glad for that because
[40:50] it actually is our security. It's a
[40:53] place of safety, which I we'll dwell on
[40:55] in a few moments. But being accepted in
[40:59] Christ refers to also a certain sphere
[41:03] of activity. We're in a certain place of
[41:06] activity. We're not idle. We're not
[41:08] motionless. We're not atrophied. So, we
[41:11] can't do anything. But this is our realm
[41:14] of activity. We're in Christ and that's
[41:16] how we move and have our being because
[41:19] we're we're in a we're in a dynamic
[41:22] place.
[41:24] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[41:27] &gt;&gt; I just came from a special meeting. I
[41:28] kind of thought that I would have some
[41:30] amens here this evening.
[41:31] &gt;&gt; You want to say scum to the pastor?
[41:36] This is a sphere of activity
[41:39] or within a certain realm of influence
[41:41] that's being in. So, we're accepted in I
[41:44] want to go over this. We're accepted in
[41:46] a place where we have a where a place of
[41:50] of security. We're accepted in a place
[41:53] of protection. We're accepted in a place
[41:56] a realm of activity and also a realm of
[42:00] constraint. We there are there are just
[42:02] things that we ourselves choose not to
[42:05] do or other things we choose to do. We
[42:09] choose we choose to once God has
[42:11] revealed himself, we choose to yield.
[42:14] You know, God's not going to force you
[42:15] to yield. We're the ones that yield.
[42:18] &gt;&gt; We do the yielding.
[42:20] &gt;&gt; God sends his spirit in upon us, but we
[42:22] do the yielding to that spirit.
[42:25] &gt;&gt; Amen. He does the revealing of his word
[42:28] and we open our hearts. Amen. I'm glad
[42:31] there is something that we can at least
[42:33] contribute
[42:35] &gt;&gt; to it.
[42:38] Now
[42:39] the first Eve because we do believe
[42:43] ourselves as the bride of Jesus Christ.
[42:46] I thought of the first Eve. She was
[42:49] blessed in a very special way when she
[42:53] really wasn't aware of it. She was
[42:55] blessed when she was in Adam
[42:58] because the Bible says, "So God created
[43:01] man in his own image, in the image of
[43:04] God created he him. Male and female
[43:08] created he them. And God blessed them."
[43:12] Plural. God blessed them. Eve was
[43:16] blessed while she was yet in Adam.
[43:20] &gt;&gt; She had not been separated, but she was
[43:22] blessed. And he said unto them, plural,
[43:26] "Be fruitful, and multiply, and
[43:29] replenish the earth, and subdue it, and
[43:33] have dominion over the fish of the sea,
[43:35] and over the fowl of the air, and over
[43:37] every living thing that moveth upon the
[43:40] earth." Eve
[43:42] was blessed in Adam,
[43:46] &gt;&gt; and that's where we are blessed.
[43:49] &gt;&gt; Eve was sealed in Adam.
[43:53] Hallelujah. Eve was protected in Adam.
[43:57] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[43:58] &gt;&gt; Eve was sinless in Adam.
[44:02] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen?
[44:03] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. It was a blessed place for
[44:06] her to be was in Adam.
[44:09] &gt;&gt; The first Eve and the second Eve is in
[44:12] Adam.
[44:13] &gt;&gt; And we are sinless in Adam.
[44:16] &gt;&gt; We are protected in Adam.
[44:18] &gt;&gt; We are secure in Adam. Hallelujah.
[44:22] Glory to God. What a blessed place. And
[44:24] we are blessed in Adam and on my message
[44:27] tonight. And we are accepted in Adam.
[44:31] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. We're accepted. Not we will
[44:33] be. We are accepted in him now.
[44:37] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[44:39] This is the place that God intended for
[44:41] his children. And these are the these
[44:44] are the uh words which I just want to uh
[44:47] dwell on momentarily.
[44:50] He said he blessed them. To be blessed
[44:53] actually in the Hebrew is to be adored.
[44:56] He said be fruitful. That's branch off
[45:00] cause to bear fruit, multiply, become
[45:03] great, to become many, and to increase
[45:07] in growth. These are the words that God
[45:10] used. Replenish. Replenish the earth
[45:13] fullness. Come to abundance. Be
[45:16] satisfied. to be accomplished something.
[45:19] Isn't it wonderful? People today strive
[45:22] for fulfillment. Oh, I'm just looking
[45:24] for fulfillment. But only a believer can
[45:27] come to that place of real contentment,
[45:30] satisfying
[45:32] uh the the satisfaction of the soul.
[45:35] We're content in Christ. We don't have
[45:38] to be anxious and, you know, be
[45:40] frightful. We don't need that.
[45:43] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[45:45] replenish the earth to be in fullness or
[45:48] abundance and subdue it to keep to keep
[45:51] under to make subservient to be subject
[45:54] and he said to have dominion and that's
[45:56] simply to have to rule.
[46:00] You're blessed,
[46:02] be fruitful,
[46:04] multiply,
[46:05] replenish, subdue, and have dominion.
[46:09] That's a blessed place. I tell you what,
[46:11] if we can just participate in all of
[46:13] those
[46:14] &gt;&gt; and and God didn't speak that back there
[46:17] just because he had nothing to say. God
[46:19] was reflecting straight through to this
[46:21] time. And the prophet of God said,
[46:23] "Everything that the first Adam lost,
[46:25] the second Adam has brought it back."
[46:27] &gt;&gt; Can you believe that? You accept that?
[46:29] &gt;&gt; And we're accepted in the beloved and we
[46:32] are called upon. We're to have back in
[46:35] the and that's why in the breach before
[46:37] even coming to the seals he's coming
[46:39] especially to that place everything that
[46:41] Adam lost everything the first Adam lost
[46:44] everything and the fellowship
[46:47] &gt;&gt; hallelujah
[46:48] &gt;&gt; we've got it back
[46:52] &gt;&gt; hallelujah
[46:53] &gt;&gt; it's accessible to you
[46:56] &gt;&gt; don't let the devil tell you anything
[46:58] other than the truth
[46:59] &gt;&gt; the truth is spoken the prophet of God
[47:02] spoke the truth and Anything contrary to
[47:04] it is a lie.
[47:06] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[47:07] &gt;&gt; We don't have to earn it or try to get
[47:08] it back somehow. It's been given back.
[47:11] So the blessing was placed on this state
[47:15] of complete oneness because now Eve is
[47:18] is in Adam and the blessing was placed
[47:23] while she was in that state
[47:26] of complete and total oneness.
[47:30] I just put down here in my notes because
[47:34] this is what I felt in the inner in my
[47:36] inner self that I've been deeply moved
[47:41] by the thought of being one with the
[47:43] word. I've asked myself,
[47:47] we've got the message.
[47:49] It it's it's been it's so wonderful. I
[47:52] have such an insatiable desire to see
[47:55] that others are blessed with this
[47:57] message. And that's why I'm I'm so
[47:59] thrilled with what takes place overseas
[48:02] and in missions and so on because I just
[48:04] I like to feel, oh, if they have an
[48:08] opportunity to be blessed like I've been
[48:09] blessed with that word, I'd be so
[48:12] thrilled with that. And that that just
[48:14] is a craving within my own heart to see
[48:16] someone else. We look out over the
[48:18] congregation. I I just trust you're able
[48:20] to feed on that word and be strengthened
[48:22] by that word and wash by that word.
[48:25] Don't leave it on the shelves, but it
[48:27] just let it flow over you and wash over
[48:29] you. Wave after wave after wave and God
[48:33] will quicken something to you. You might
[48:35] live on that for days.
[48:37] &gt;&gt; Oh, how wonderful it is.
[48:40] &gt;&gt; What a wonderful word we have.
[48:43] &gt;&gt; And I and I I I contemplated and thought
[48:46] much about you, Lord, I just want to be
[48:49] one. How do I get to be one with the
[48:52] word? H how
[48:54] what is it that I need to do to be one
[48:57] to be completely united like in a
[49:00] marriage union? I just want to be one
[49:02] with with Christ. Not something that we
[49:04] just say but something that is practical
[49:07] in our lives and actually happens. And I
[49:10] I feel that we need to uh in order for
[49:13] me to do that and that's what I'm
[49:15] conveying to you tonight is is you just
[49:16] live in it. You ponder it. You think
[49:19] about it. You lay down resting and you
[49:22] think about it and you sit up and you're
[49:24] thinking about it and you're in your car
[49:26] and maybe you hear a little bit of a a
[49:28] message, a tape or whatever more. If
[49:30] you're just in your quiet time, you're
[49:32] thinking about it. Yeah. You're you're
[49:34] pondering it and you let that word and
[49:36] while I was away, I was speaking to the
[49:38] people about the on the subject of the
[49:40] anointing which I spoke here about three
[49:42] services and I just thought of the the
[49:44] the anointed the the word itself is
[49:47] anointed. That is that's the very breath
[49:49] of God. Let that breath of God breathe
[49:52] on you. Tomorrow, tonight, and the next
[49:55] week. Just let it breathe on you. It's
[49:57] the anointing being poured into you. You
[50:00] don't know when you're going to need it.
[50:01] You ate food today. You don't know when
[50:03] you're going to need that food. You
[50:05] don't know it might be fighting off.
[50:07] Some infection right now or some other
[50:10] some contrary cells might be fighting it
[50:12] off. You have no knowledge of it. You
[50:14] have no feeling about it. You don't feel
[50:16] good. you don't feel bad but the food
[50:19] that you eat the thing that you take on
[50:21] and we eat uh you know sensibly and
[50:24] healthy it it it is doing something in
[50:27] our system we we don't know about it but
[50:30] and you hear the word you take it in you
[50:33] absorb it you let it penetrate you
[50:36] ponder it drops into your soul you don't
[50:38] know what it's doing all the time but
[50:40] it's fighting off
[50:42] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah giving you victory
[50:44] &gt;&gt; fighting off the enemy waring against
[50:48] doubt and fear and waring against
[50:50] criticism and waring against all these
[50:53] things. And people say, "I have low
[50:55] self-esteem." Take on the word and it'll
[50:57] it'll fight that thing off.
[51:00] &gt;&gt; I just feel twisted up inside. Take on
[51:02] the word. Let it wash over you. Become
[51:04] one with it. Hallelujah. Ponder this
[51:07] tonight. Accept it in the beloved.
[51:09] Accept it in the beloved. Isn't it
[51:11] wonderful to be accepted?
[51:14] I thought of the ultimate rejection
[51:18] and even while you know sometimes the
[51:20] little things happen in in the day and
[51:22] in your normal life I was just coming
[51:25] out of a parking lot and I thought
[51:29] coming home well I'll just pay this
[51:31] ticket ahead of time I'll just so I I
[51:34] put my parking card in the machine
[51:38] says denied
[51:41] I don't like that. Try it again. Denied.
[51:46] Again, denied. Well, I'll have to get a
[51:49] human being then. If the machine's going
[51:51] to deny me, get a human being and hope
[51:53] they don't deny me. But the ultimate
[51:56] denial
[51:57] said, "Oh, we felt anointed. We we sang.
[52:02] We worshiped. We we went to church. We
[52:04] paid tithes. We prayed. We saw great
[52:07] things happen. We prophesied all these
[52:10] things." Then to here, depart.
[52:15] &gt;&gt; I never knew you.
[52:18] &gt;&gt; I came to church tonight. I said, God,
[52:20] don't let one person
[52:22] &gt;&gt; sitting in our congregation tonight ever
[52:25] have to hear those words.
[52:29] &gt;&gt; You want to say tonight, you know, one
[52:30] thing, you might not you might not have
[52:32] to believe everything I say, but you
[52:34] have to believe everything Jesus said.
[52:36] And as sure as there's breath in your
[52:38] lungs, that's going to happen.
[52:40] &gt;&gt; It's going to happen. There's going to
[52:42] be people just like yourself who love
[52:45] their children, who love their husbands
[52:47] and wives, who had happy times and
[52:50] sorrowful times. There's going to be
[52:52] people just like you going to hear those
[52:54] words,
[52:55] &gt;&gt; depart from me. The ultimate denial, the
[52:59] ultimate rejection, and the one where
[53:02] there's no recourse. I say, "Oh God, let
[53:05] us not waste any time. We're the people
[53:07] of all people on the earth. You have
[53:10] been given something that multitudes,
[53:12] millions of others have never tasted."
[53:15] &gt;&gt; How we ought to rejoice tonight. How we
[53:18] ought to be able to just take and even
[53:20] stand and say, "Oh God, how privileged I
[53:23] am to be accepted in the beloved."
[53:28] &gt;&gt; What a privileged people we are.
[53:31] &gt;&gt; And it shall never take and become
[53:34] common place to us.
[53:36] &gt;&gt; Oh God, how we love you.
[53:43] &gt;&gt; I'm challenged to maintain
[53:47] &gt;&gt; and not let the enemy take it from me to
[53:51] maintain this place of oneness. I'm
[53:54] challenged to that. How to achieve and
[53:56] maintain it is a real challenge. And I
[53:59] say long after this service, after
[54:01] you've gone, day after day, I want you
[54:03] to think about it. If brother Ed was
[54:05] challenged, he wants to be one with that
[54:07] word. It's not enough just to say,
[54:09] "Well, I am one with the word." That's
[54:11] good. That's a good confession. But we
[54:13] want to be able to say, "Oh, God, I'm
[54:15] striving for that oneness. I don't want
[54:18] anything to affect it. I want anything
[54:20] to separate. I don't want anything to
[54:22] cloud this relationship
[54:25] &gt;&gt; because this is a marriage, you know.
[54:28] You that are married, you know that we
[54:31] as partners, we walk softly.
[54:34] We need to
[54:36] &gt;&gt; because all kinds of things can come in
[54:38] and afflict.
[54:40] It's the most perfect relationship.
[54:43] &gt;&gt; And you can even become accustomed to
[54:45] something less than what it should be.
[54:48] &gt;&gt; And I say we should not do that. We
[54:50] should not allow that.
[54:52] &gt;&gt; Now it got quiet, but you ought to say
[54:54] amen again. So, I'm going to confess
[54:57] that God intended I should have a
[55:00] wonderful relationship here on this
[55:02] earth. And God, make me what I need to
[55:04] be. Make my partner what they need to
[55:06] be, my husband, my wife. Make us what we
[55:08] need to be so we can be uh not only one
[55:11] and have our wonderful relationship, but
[55:13] we can be an example to others, a
[55:15] strength to others.
[55:23] &gt;&gt; Only the grace of God
[55:26] can sustain us and sustain our spirit
[55:28] and our resolve and our dedication
[55:31] to our position in Christ.
[55:34] I'm dedicated. We want to be forcefully
[55:37] resolved. Dedicated to this place in
[55:41] Christ.
[55:43] &gt;&gt; Might be here as a young person,
[55:45] unmarried person, which is fine. Single
[55:49] person is no less has no less meaning to
[55:53] you. Don't let the enemy
[55:57] distract or take something away from you
[55:59] that belongs to you. That is something
[56:01] that I'm so so consumed with.
[56:06] In the message of oneness, brother
[56:08] Brandon said that God's purpose, he said
[56:10] that's God's purpose. And his purpose as
[56:13] father,
[56:15] as father supreme, was to be one with
[56:18] his family. That was his purpose as
[56:21] father supreme to be one with his
[56:23] family, his earthly family, Adam and
[56:26] Eve. And the only way that they could be
[56:29] one with the family
[56:32] or with God was because God's nature was
[56:36] in them.
[56:38] &gt;&gt; Do you hear that?
[56:40] We need his nature
[56:42] &gt;&gt; in us.
[56:44] Oh, how I need that.
[56:47] So that made them with God's nature in
[56:49] them. Then with each other and God, they
[56:53] became all one. He said, "And isn't that
[56:55] a beautiful picture?" And I say, "Yes,
[56:57] brother Brandham. That's a beautiful
[56:58] picture, and it's a picture I desire
[57:01] that I might possess and have.
[57:05] God in his family, father over all,
[57:08] supreme, no death, no sorrow, no
[57:11] heartaches, no nothing. Just joy
[57:13] unspeakable. Never to be sick. Never to
[57:16] have a heartache. Just one with God.
[57:19] What a picture.
[57:22] The place of blessing for the believer
[57:25] is in Christ. As I said a few moments
[57:27] ago, Eve was sealed. She was safe. She
[57:31] was secure in Adam. And the blessing on
[57:35] her
[57:37] was irrevocable.
[57:39] God would not take it back. He blessed
[57:42] them and he wouldn't take that blessing
[57:43] back. He's blessed the bride of Jesus
[57:46] Christ in Christ and he won't take it
[57:48] back.
[57:49] &gt;&gt; Isn't that wonderful? Not going to
[57:51] change his mind. Say, "Oh, maybe I, you
[57:54] know, maybe I should uh re-speak that or
[57:57] rethink that." No, it's it it's
[57:59] irvocable. He's just declared it and
[58:01] that's all it is.
[58:03] &gt;&gt; Blessed are they in Christ,
[58:06] &gt;&gt; accepted in the beloved.
[58:08] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[58:13] Just hang on because I want to go a
[58:15] little bit further.
[58:16] &gt;&gt; It's important to understand also that
[58:19] both man and woman's place is in Christ.
[58:24] Both man and woman. It's not enough for
[58:26] the woman to say, "Oh, let's my husband
[58:28] needs to do it." Or, you know, no. And
[58:30] and for every person, we all have to
[58:33] have that individual
[58:35] relationship
[58:37] of being in Christ. Okay, you say how
[58:40] how am I in Christ? Well, perhaps I
[58:43] can't give you the fullest and the most
[58:46] complete. But I say one thing, one of
[58:49] the one of the first things I would tell
[58:51] you is what I've already alluded to this
[58:54] evening, and that is a steady diet.
[59:02] I could look at a at a beautiful
[59:06] Thanksgiving turkey dinner or Christmas
[59:09] dinner or whatever more beautiful
[59:10] prepared dinner. I can just look at it,
[59:12] figure out now scientifically,
[59:15] how can I be one with this dinner?
[59:19] How am I going to be one with this
[59:21] turkey? How's it going to work? And
[59:24] what's it going to do? And get all the
[59:26] theology of it. Forget the theology.
[59:28] Just eat it.
[59:30] &gt;&gt; Just dive into it.
[59:32] &gt;&gt; Just start eating it and taking it down
[59:34] and thinking about it and reading it and
[59:37] pondering it and memorize it and say it
[59:39] over and over. When you get into
[59:41] something, say, "I find that hard to I
[59:43] find it hard to comprehend." Just say it
[59:45] again. Keep saying it again. And
[59:48] finally, it'll come into you.
[59:50] Hallelujah. And the prophet said, "How
[59:51] many times?" Say it until you believe
[59:53] it. Just say it and ponder it. That's
[59:56] the That's the best advice I can give
[59:58] you of becoming one with it.
[1:00:01] &gt;&gt; And it works.
[1:00:02] &gt;&gt; It absolutely works.
[1:00:05] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. When you think enough about
[1:00:06] him, you won't have time to think about
[1:00:08] all the negative things and all the
[1:00:10] trouble and all the problems.
[1:00:12] &gt;&gt; If you got any questions, just think
[1:00:13] about the word. Think about the message.
[1:00:15] Take it in. And the questions, believe
[1:00:17] it or not, the questions will get
[1:00:19] answered.
[1:00:20] &gt;&gt; You got burdens.
[1:00:22] &gt;&gt; If you haven't, come my way. And I'll
[1:00:24] give you a few.
[1:00:27] We got lots of things to be burdened
[1:00:28] about, but the best way to remain
[1:00:31] energized.
[1:00:32] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:00:33] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:00:37] &gt;&gt; Had people come to me and I, you know,
[1:00:39] so once in a while you say something
[1:00:41] personal, say, I've been preaching, you
[1:00:43] know, my wife is here and we've been
[1:00:45] married 53 years. And and somebody came
[1:00:47] up says, you've been married 53 years.
[1:00:49] You just preached like a young man. I
[1:00:51] was so glad. I felt better about being a
[1:00:53] young man almost and being married 53
[1:00:55] years.
[1:01:00] &gt;&gt; My wife knows what I'm saying.
[1:01:03] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:01:05] &gt;&gt; It's wonderful to just feel that
[1:01:06] supernatural
[1:01:08] &gt;&gt; energy. You don't have to put it on.
[1:01:09] It's it's just there. It's part of the
[1:01:11] word.
[1:01:12] &gt;&gt; Say, where does it come from? Where does
[1:01:13] the enthusiasm come? Comes right out of
[1:01:15] the message, sir.
[1:01:16] &gt;&gt; I can't I can't read the message and
[1:01:18] feel depressed. If you feel depressed,
[1:01:21] take on the word.
[1:01:23] &gt;&gt; Eat it.
[1:01:24] &gt;&gt; Not eat the turkey. Eat the lamb.
[1:01:27] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Eat the lamb. Just keep
[1:01:28] eating on it.
[1:01:30] &gt;&gt; You'll be surprised what it'll do for
[1:01:32] you. You'll be surprised what it'll do
[1:01:33] for this congregation. Every answer,
[1:01:36] Christ is the answer. Christ is the word
[1:01:40] &gt;&gt; and we are accepted. You're accepted in
[1:01:42] him.
[1:01:43] &gt;&gt; God won't take it back.
[1:01:45] &gt;&gt; Amen. God bless you. See, brother Ryan
[1:01:47] saying, "Amen." And brother Ryan flew
[1:01:49] all all night to come down to Tennessee
[1:01:52] and play the piano. It was wonderful,
[1:01:54] Brother Ryan. I'm sure proud of you.
[1:01:56] Thank you. God bless you.
[1:01:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:02:00] &gt;&gt; Just keep saying amen. I'll look your
[1:02:01] way every once in a while.
[1:02:04] &gt;&gt; I just like the thought of being sealed
[1:02:06] in him.
[1:02:07] &gt;&gt; Oh, it just feels so good.
[1:02:09] &gt;&gt; Just sealed. I'm secure. Take that,
[1:02:12] devil.
[1:02:13] &gt;&gt; Take that.
[1:02:15] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Take that old negative
[1:02:17] thing. Yes, sir.
[1:02:18] &gt;&gt; Glory to God. You hear all kinds of
[1:02:20] things when after I've got all loaded
[1:02:22] with all kinds of negative things, I
[1:02:24] just like to think about being sealed in
[1:02:26] him, being accepted in him. Tell the
[1:02:29] devil, you can't do anything with me.
[1:02:32] I'm untouchable.
[1:02:34] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. I'm in the second Adam.
[1:02:36] &gt;&gt; That's not just some hype. That's the
[1:02:38] truth of God's word.
[1:02:41] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:02:42] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:02:44] &gt;&gt; Believe it and you'll enjoy it. Don't
[1:02:46] believe it. You'll stay where you're at.
[1:02:49] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:02:50] &gt;&gt; You don't want to stay where you're at,
[1:02:52] do you?
[1:02:53] &gt;&gt; Oh, good. Good. Then I'm preaching to
[1:02:54] the right crowd.
[1:02:57] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:02:59] All right.
[1:03:01] In uh in Corinthians, Paul said this,
[1:03:04] "Be ye followers of me even as I also am
[1:03:10] of Christ."
[1:03:11] &gt;&gt; That's what we all need to say. Parents
[1:03:13] need to say that to children.
[1:03:14] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:03:15] Follow me.
[1:03:17] &gt;&gt; Mothers need to say that to their
[1:03:19] children, to their daughters.
[1:03:21] &gt;&gt; Husbands need to say it to their wives
[1:03:22] and their family.
[1:03:24] &gt;&gt; Follow me as I follow Christ.
[1:03:27] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:03:29] &gt;&gt; That's a fine line, so I'll I'll just
[1:03:31] get off it.
[1:03:33] You might be called to be a housewife.
[1:03:36] Brother Brandham says in the great
[1:03:38] warrior David, you might be called to be
[1:03:40] a housewife.
[1:03:42] How many housewives have we got?
[1:03:46] You're called to be a housewife,
[1:03:49] but you got a position in Christ.
[1:03:53] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:03:55] &gt;&gt; Oh, you might think that that's hard.
[1:03:59] You got a position. If you're washing
[1:04:01] pans or washing clothes or serving your
[1:04:05] family or serving your husband, you've
[1:04:07] got a position is in Christ.
[1:04:10] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:04:12] We're not just talking about some, you
[1:04:14] know, uh uh how to live a better life.
[1:04:17] Here's a prophet saying, "You got your
[1:04:19] position in Christ Jesus by the Holy
[1:04:21] Ghost." And he said, "Amen."
[1:04:24] You're just as much David as the rest of
[1:04:27] them was.
[1:04:30] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:04:32] &gt;&gt; Accepted.
[1:04:33] Acceptance is expressed in a number of
[1:04:36] ways in the Bible. It's expressed a
[1:04:38] number of ways. And I got thinking uh
[1:04:41] you know I made this very personal
[1:04:43] thought. How do I know I'm accepted? You
[1:04:46] might say, "Oh, brother brother Ed,
[1:04:47] you're up there. You're pastor. You know
[1:04:49] you're accepted." Well, no. I like to
[1:04:51] ask myself that question. You know, I
[1:04:53] just read it. It's a phrase. How do I
[1:04:54] know I'm accepted? Everybody thinks
[1:04:56] they're accepted. All kinds of people.
[1:04:58] So, I I I I bring it right down to
[1:05:01] ground zero. I say, "Well, number one, I
[1:05:03] got a message.
[1:05:05] &gt;&gt; And number two, that message was brought
[1:05:07] by a vindicated prophet." And he did
[1:05:09] things that no man has done worldwide
[1:05:12] around the globe since Adam.
[1:05:15] &gt;&gt; You can't find if you've got it in a
[1:05:18] history book. I'd like to see it and I
[1:05:20] want to see the evidence of it. I want
[1:05:22] to hear it on tape. I want to hear the
[1:05:24] evidence. You say, "Well, it was before
[1:05:26] tape." Well, we'd have to have just a
[1:05:28] absolutely qualified evidence that this
[1:05:31] happened. And and isn't it amazing that
[1:05:33] all these hundreds of people and even
[1:05:35] thousands that I've met and and
[1:05:37] thousands and thousands of unbelievers,
[1:05:39] people that don't believe this message
[1:05:41] and actually hate this message but can't
[1:05:43] dig up any evidence that even is
[1:05:46] compares with it.
[1:05:48] &gt;&gt; So that's why we have a reason to
[1:05:50] believe what we're believing. It's a
[1:05:51] supernatural gospel.
[1:05:54] &gt;&gt; God did something for us and gave us a
[1:05:57] heart to believe it.
[1:05:58] &gt;&gt; It's never happened. If it's happened,
[1:06:00] let's see it. As I was saying in brother
[1:06:02] Donny's church of people of you know uh
[1:06:05] somebody in Yugoslavia when we were
[1:06:07] there brother Milco you and I and and I
[1:06:09] was preaching there in a little church
[1:06:11] and and a Baptist church and uh a man
[1:06:14] came up he's from from the United States
[1:06:16] someplace and he came up and I was
[1:06:18] putting forward the message and how God
[1:06:20] sent brother Brandham as a messenger and
[1:06:21] a prophet messenger. This fell came up
[1:06:23] and he says, well, well, he says, I
[1:06:25] believe that Jimmy Swagger's carrying
[1:06:27] the ball now.
[1:06:31] I wonder if he believes that today.
[1:06:37] Respectfully, people who thought and
[1:06:39] came under the influence of others that
[1:06:41] thought they really carrying the ball
[1:06:42] found out they fumbled the ball
[1:06:45] &gt;&gt; badly,
[1:06:47] &gt;&gt; badly. But we're following a message and
[1:06:49] a messenger that never fumbled the ball.
[1:06:52] He packed it. He packed it across the
[1:06:54] goal line and won a and and won a a a
[1:06:57] great victory for Christ. Can you not
[1:07:00] say amen to that?
[1:07:02] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:07:03] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And I don't know what that
[1:07:05] man achieved in Yugoslavia, but I'm glad
[1:07:08] for the message the way it is today in
[1:07:10] the in the many countries that came out
[1:07:12] of the former Yugoslavia.
[1:07:16] and some I was in a I was in a a motel
[1:07:22] down there in some meetings and they've
[1:07:23] got a TBN I think it is uh Trinity
[1:07:26] Broadcasting or something once a while
[1:07:27] like to see you know what are these
[1:07:29] fellas saying turn it on believe it or
[1:07:32] not this exactly what it was a man and a
[1:07:34] woman sitting there like Hollywood style
[1:07:36] you know like these television programs
[1:07:39] they were ministers and he looks right
[1:07:42] at the camera he says you know right now
[1:07:45] and he says to his wife, you know, right
[1:07:47] now, he said, you just feel something.
[1:07:50] There's somebody in Texas, he said, has
[1:07:52] got a pain in their knee.
[1:07:55] And I said, oh my god, how can anybody
[1:07:57] believe that? Almost everybody in Texas
[1:08:00] got a pain in their knee.
[1:08:06] And and and they go on like that and try
[1:08:08] to sell that to people as something
[1:08:10] supernatural. No wonder the world mocks.
[1:08:14] says they tried to build a tower and
[1:08:16] didn't have sufficient to build it. But
[1:08:18] my brother, my sister, that never
[1:08:20] happened in this message.
[1:08:23] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. We got an absolute.
[1:08:28] &gt;&gt; Never once had to say, "Oh, I'm sorry. I
[1:08:29] have to take that back." We got a word.
[1:08:32] A word that's clear. A word that's
[1:08:34] supernatural. A word with power. A word
[1:08:37] that's cleansing. A word that will give
[1:08:40] you security and assurance. We're sealed
[1:08:42] in Christ.
[1:08:45] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:08:48] &gt;&gt; There isn't a thing that you and I can
[1:08:50] face in this life or this generation,
[1:08:53] but what God has has more than given us
[1:08:56] the uh uh the power within.
[1:09:00] The Bible says, now I must go along
[1:09:02] quickly.
[1:09:03] The Bible says,
[1:09:06] well, first let me just back up just a
[1:09:09] wee bit. I said acceptance comes and
[1:09:11] it's expressed in a number of ways and
[1:09:13] one of the ways is when God calls and I
[1:09:18] think that's very important because I
[1:09:20] don't think you people would be here on
[1:09:22] a Wednesday evening
[1:09:25] if you hadn't felt at some point in time
[1:09:28] the call of God upon your life. Now a
[1:09:32] lot of people, multitudes, millions have
[1:09:36] perhaps felt and heard a call of God and
[1:09:39] they would say so.
[1:09:41] But I if it's a call of God, then I
[1:09:44] believe that God will direct that person
[1:09:48] to the voice
[1:09:50] &gt;&gt; to achieve what the call was all about.
[1:09:55] &gt;&gt; Samuel was a boy, 12. I understand. Just
[1:09:58] a boy like some of you lads here in the
[1:10:00] front seat. 12 years old he was. And he
[1:10:03] heard his name called
[1:10:07] Samuel. Samuel. He goes out to Eli. Eli
[1:10:11] sends him back. I didn't call you. He
[1:10:13] thought Eli was calling him Samuel. And
[1:10:16] the call kept coming. But what the point
[1:10:18] I want to make with you tonight, he had
[1:10:20] already been accepted as God's prophet
[1:10:24] even though he was a lad at at a lad
[1:10:27] hearing the call. In other words,
[1:10:29] hearing the call is evidence that a
[1:10:32] person hearing the call. When the elect
[1:10:35] hear the call, you're already been
[1:10:37] accepted
[1:10:38] &gt;&gt; even though you don't know it. Apostle
[1:10:40] Paul on the way to Damascus heard the
[1:10:43] call. He heard his name. Saul soul, why
[1:10:46] persecutest thou me? He was already
[1:10:48] accepted as a prophet or as a apostle to
[1:10:51] the Gentiles already accepted.
[1:10:54] &gt;&gt; My news to you tonight is when you heard
[1:10:58] the call, go back in your life when you
[1:11:00] heard the call, you're already accepted.
[1:11:03] &gt;&gt; If you're here tonight and you haven't
[1:11:05] heard that call, or maybe you have heard
[1:11:07] the call, but you haven't said what some
[1:11:10] of these people have said, "Here am I,
[1:11:12] Lord." Amen.
[1:11:13] &gt;&gt; Isaiah said, "Send me."
[1:11:15] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:11:15] &gt;&gt; When Brother Brandham was young, a boy,
[1:11:18] just young, and God was calling him,
[1:11:21] look what he was calling him to. And
[1:11:23] there he is packing water for his dad's
[1:11:28] alcohol system,
[1:11:30] &gt;&gt; making whiskey,
[1:11:31] &gt;&gt; and he's carrying water, but he hears a
[1:11:34] call. He hears a voice. He He hears
[1:11:38] something. And to him, it's strange. It
[1:11:41] even carries on him to into his married
[1:11:43] life.
[1:11:45] But it was a call of God and he didn't
[1:11:47] know where it was going to take him. He
[1:11:49] didn't understand it. But let me tell
[1:11:51] you when the call came, see I say God
[1:11:55] indicates his acceptance in a number of
[1:11:58] ways. And one of the main ways is he
[1:12:00] calls the individual. And when God calls
[1:12:03] the elect, there's no turning back.
[1:12:08] I haven't got time to go into that in as
[1:12:10] deep as I would like to.
[1:12:13] But then the Bible speaks of Christ and
[1:12:16] I want to come to this beloved one. If
[1:12:18] you just give me your attention for
[1:12:20] another about 15 minutes and I'm going
[1:12:22] to close. And there came a voice from
[1:12:25] heaven saying, "Thou art my beloved son
[1:12:29] in whom I'm well pleased." And in uh
[1:12:33] Luke's gospel
[1:12:36] 3 and22 it says and the Holy Ghost
[1:12:38] descended in a bodily shape like a dove
[1:12:42] upon him in a voice from heaven which
[1:12:44] said thou art my beloved son. In thee
[1:12:49] I'm well pleased. You're not just my
[1:12:52] son. You're my beloved son. And the
[1:12:55] apostle Paul has picked that up and he
[1:12:57] says you are accepted in the beloved.
[1:13:01] Not you're just accepted in the son, but
[1:13:03] you're accepted in the beloved son.
[1:13:06] Apostle Paul is picking something up
[1:13:08] here. There's a special a special
[1:13:12] relationship that God is is giving uh
[1:13:16] audible declaration on earth. You are my
[1:13:19] beloved son. This is my beloved son.
[1:13:22] Hear ye him.
[1:13:24] No wonder, no wonder God's messenger in
[1:13:27] this day would say and even title
[1:13:31] messages,
[1:13:33] hear ye him.
[1:13:35] &gt;&gt; Hear ye him. This is my beloved son. And
[1:13:38] brother Brandham put it in whom in whom
[1:13:40] I dwell.
[1:13:42] &gt;&gt; Hear ye him.
[1:13:44] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And you've been accepted in
[1:13:46] that son. I want to dwell on that.
[1:13:48] That's a blessed thing. And we ought to
[1:13:50] give thanks to God tonight. Oh God, that
[1:13:53] you put me. We could say, well, thank
[1:13:55] you that we have this place. It's
[1:13:56] comfortable and I've got a nice seat to
[1:13:58] sit on. That's just that that doesn't
[1:14:01] amount to anything. But when we can say,
[1:14:03] I've come into a special place.
[1:14:06] &gt;&gt; God has brought me into a special place.
[1:14:09] Into his beloved son,
[1:14:12] someone who he's looked on. Now think
[1:14:16] about this, please.
[1:14:21] When God looked on Adam,
[1:14:24] God knew that Eve was in him.
[1:14:31] God also knew that Adam could not create
[1:14:34] Eve.
[1:14:37] He'd only go to sleep
[1:14:40] and God would do the act of taking Eve
[1:14:42] from him.
[1:14:44] But when God looked on Christ, he didn't
[1:14:47] only know that Christ,
[1:14:50] that Eve, the second Eve, he didn't only
[1:14:53] see you and I in him follow this God's
[1:14:58] infinite. He knew that this son was
[1:15:02] going to be obedient. He's going to take
[1:15:04] every step. He knew that he would go to
[1:15:07] the cross willingly. And at the at
[1:15:11] Calvary, he's going to pay for the woman
[1:15:13] that was in him.
[1:15:15] &gt;&gt; Are you following that?
[1:15:17] &gt;&gt; And he knew further because he was the
[1:15:20] word. And that was the word that had
[1:15:22] come out of the logos in the beginning.
[1:15:25] At some at some I can't even say a point
[1:15:28] in time because there was no time. But
[1:15:30] in that great eternity, the prophet said
[1:15:33] he'd take a little journey and a little
[1:15:35] light came out from that from from that
[1:15:38] being. little light, little white light
[1:15:40] came out. There was a logos and that
[1:15:43] logos was the word said in another
[1:15:46] place. It was the sun. It was the son of
[1:15:48] God that came out. It was that it was
[1:15:51] the logos. It was that word that and by
[1:15:53] that force he was going to create
[1:15:56] everything. So in the beginning was the
[1:15:58] word and the word was with God and the
[1:16:01] word was God. Amen. Amen.
[1:16:04] &gt;&gt; And the Bible says all things were made
[1:16:07] by him and without him was nothing made
[1:16:10] that is made. And so here's this here's
[1:16:13] this one now is on earth. This one by
[1:16:16] whom and the God that was in him that he
[1:16:20] was the very word the word now was made
[1:16:23] flesh. And by that word everything was
[1:16:26] created that had been created but in him
[1:16:30] was a bride that had not yet been
[1:16:31] created.
[1:16:34] Hallelujah.
[1:16:36] &gt;&gt; And when God said, "This is my beloved
[1:16:39] son," he knew that that son also was
[1:16:42] going to speak some more words.
[1:16:44] Hallelujah. And the spirit that was in
[1:16:47] him was going to come into his chosen
[1:16:49] ones, his apostles, and they would
[1:16:52] speak, and God would bring forth by
[1:16:54] creative power
[1:16:56] &gt;&gt; a bride. He'd create you.
[1:16:59] &gt;&gt; He'd create me. He created this body of
[1:17:02] people by that which was in Christ when
[1:17:05] he looked on him and said beloved son
[1:17:09] &gt;&gt; and that's why the apostle Paul said we
[1:17:11] are accepted in the beloved actually
[1:17:14] we've been created by the beloved
[1:17:20] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah
[1:17:21] &gt;&gt; why don't we loosen up and give the Lord
[1:17:23] a clap offer
[1:17:29] been created in the beloved
[1:17:34] We are loved by the beloved.
[1:17:38] &gt;&gt; You have been created.
[1:17:41] &gt;&gt; You've been made. It's
[1:17:42] &gt;&gt; why he said he made us accepted in the
[1:17:46] beloved.
[1:17:47] &gt;&gt; Oh my.
[1:17:49] &gt;&gt; Feel like preaching.
[1:17:51] &gt;&gt; Glory.
[1:17:52] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And that's why God looked on
[1:17:54] him. It wasn't just Jesus of Nazareth,
[1:17:57] but it was all that was in him. And the
[1:18:00] prophet of God said clearly over and
[1:18:02] over and over, you were in him.
[1:18:04] &gt;&gt; So you were in him at Calvary.
[1:18:06] &gt;&gt; You were in him.
[1:18:08] &gt;&gt; You lived with him. You died with him.
[1:18:10] But you were in him when God looked on
[1:18:13] him and said, "My beloved son.
[1:18:17] &gt;&gt; You were in him then. I was in him. You
[1:18:20] were in him." And all that he was, you
[1:18:22] are.
[1:18:23] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And he poured everything
[1:18:25] into Christ. and from Christ poured
[1:18:27] everything into the church.
[1:18:30] &gt;&gt; Beloved,
[1:18:33] &gt;&gt; can't have a beloved son without having
[1:18:35] a beloved wife.
[1:18:38] &gt;&gt; She's beloved.
[1:18:40] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. That's why he had joy in his
[1:18:43] heart to give his life for her.
[1:18:46] &gt;&gt; Husbands, love your wives as Christ
[1:18:49] loved the church and gave himself for
[1:18:53] it.
[1:18:58] Hallelujah.
[1:19:01] When God made this audible declaration,
[1:19:05] he saw us in his beloved son.
[1:19:09] And this son by whom all things were
[1:19:11] created.
[1:19:12] In him was life, the scripture says, and
[1:19:15] the life was the light of all men.
[1:19:18] He was the word before he was flesh,
[1:19:22] was he not? And we were in him in word
[1:19:25] form
[1:19:27] before the word became flesh.
[1:19:30] John 1 and4 in him was life and the life
[1:19:33] was the light of man. John 1 and3 and
[1:19:36] all things were made by him and without
[1:19:38] him was not anything made that was made.
[1:19:42] You were made by him
[1:19:45] &gt;&gt; and for him.
[1:19:47] &gt;&gt; Your mother and father in the natural
[1:19:49] birth brought you forth. But don't put
[1:19:52] too much emphasis on that.
[1:19:56] &gt;&gt; That's not the important part of this.
[1:19:58] They were just instruments to bring
[1:20:00] forth a body in whom God would dwell.
[1:20:03] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. God didn't reveal himself to
[1:20:06] you in your flesh, in just your mortal
[1:20:09] ears. God revealed himself to you in
[1:20:12] your soul. Hallelujah. Your spirit was
[1:20:14] quickened. It was so all-encompassing
[1:20:16] that you couldn't even tell what part of
[1:20:19] you it your whole being was just gripped
[1:20:22] by the revelation of God's word
[1:20:24] &gt;&gt; and the light that went on in your soul.
[1:20:27] &gt;&gt; Isn't that true?
[1:20:29] &gt;&gt; Isn't that true?
[1:20:30] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:20:32] &gt;&gt; And he does that. He does that and did
[1:20:34] that because she's beloved.
[1:20:38] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:20:42] &gt;&gt; He said and show us the father. He said,
[1:20:44] "Look at the beginning there." He said,
[1:20:45] "I see this great space yonder and then
[1:20:48] the logos went out of God which was
[1:20:50] Christ." I'm not repeating. I'm just
[1:20:52] giving I speak preach it and then I back
[1:20:54] up and and give the quote so you know
[1:20:57] just how it's worded. He said, "And the
[1:20:59] logos went out from God which was the
[1:21:01] Christ, the anointing that went out and
[1:21:04] we're standing on the banister watching
[1:21:06] the creation come into existence and see
[1:21:09] whether he was the son." Now in the
[1:21:11] Hebrew series chapter 1, the logos and
[1:21:14] this great fountain, this great fountain
[1:21:17] of spirit which had no beginning or no
[1:21:19] end, this great spirit began to form in
[1:21:22] the creation. And the logos that went
[1:21:24] out uh from it was the son of God. It
[1:21:28] was the only visible form that this
[1:21:30] spirit had and it was a theophony which
[1:21:34] means a body and this body was like a
[1:21:37] man. And he goes on to describe it. I
[1:21:39] tell you what, friends, I say never a
[1:21:41] man speak like this man.
[1:21:48] &gt;&gt; May be more eloquent people, but as far
[1:21:50] as I'm concerned, there isn't any more
[1:21:52] eloquent words
[1:21:53] &gt;&gt; because those eloquent people don't
[1:21:55] somehow include you and grip you and
[1:21:58] bring you into the picture. What this
[1:22:00] prophet of God said brings a people into
[1:22:02] the picture and he identifies who they
[1:22:04] are. They're the bride of Jesus Christ.
[1:22:06] spotless, virtuous, bride of Jesus
[1:22:08] Christ. She's accepted in the beloved,
[1:22:15] &gt;&gt; the beloved one,
[1:22:18] sending out the words of his creative
[1:22:20] power, creating his own bride.
[1:22:24] I only have about six minutes and I've
[1:22:26] got a ways to go, but I'm I'm not going
[1:22:27] to be long.
[1:22:29] But this is a if you want to read it,
[1:22:31] you want to read it at home. It's a
[1:22:35] leodyian church age. It's in chapter 9
[1:22:38] and it's a 336 page 336 of the church
[1:22:42] age book and and this is so outstanding.
[1:22:46] He says, "And now he is standing." He's
[1:22:48] speaking of him standing amongst the the
[1:22:50] candlestick. He said, "And now he's
[1:22:52] standing in the midst of the church." As
[1:22:55] he stands there revealing who he is in
[1:22:57] the last age. When he begins to reveal
[1:23:00] himself, whoever he's revealing himself
[1:23:02] personally is accepted
[1:23:05] &gt;&gt; in him.
[1:23:06] &gt;&gt; He's revealing himself personally to the
[1:23:09] individuals that's accepted in him
[1:23:11] &gt;&gt; and he's revealing himself in the last
[1:23:13] days. He calls himself the author uh of
[1:23:16] the creation of God. This is another
[1:23:19] creation. This has this has to do with
[1:23:22] the church. This is a special
[1:23:25] designation of himself. He is the
[1:23:27] creator of that church. The heavenly
[1:23:31] bridegroom created his own bride. Oh,
[1:23:34] now before he even took the place of
[1:23:36] bridegroom when he was here on earth and
[1:23:39] God the father called it, spoke out of
[1:23:41] heaven said audibly, "This is my beloved
[1:23:45] son."
[1:23:47] &gt;&gt; And he was speaking to him, speaking to
[1:23:50] the people. And in him was the very
[1:23:53] words of life. Hadn't spoken them yet.
[1:23:55] that would create a people.
[1:23:58] &gt;&gt; My brothers and sisters, tonight I want
[1:24:00] to declare to you, even though you may
[1:24:03] know this, but that'll be emphasized and
[1:24:05] and uh uh reconfirmed in your heart, we
[1:24:08] are we are the object that have been
[1:24:11] created by words that have originated in
[1:24:16] that beloved son.
[1:24:18] He may have used other people and in
[1:24:20] this day he used a prophet to utter that
[1:24:23] breath of God out of his mouth creating
[1:24:25] a people. And you're not here by
[1:24:28] accident. You're not here even by your
[1:24:30] own choice.
[1:24:32] &gt;&gt; You're here because God elected to
[1:24:35] reveal himself to you. And when he begin
[1:24:37] to reveal himself to you, identify you
[1:24:40] and call you out. That is that is what I
[1:24:43] call being called by your name
[1:24:45] &gt;&gt; because he he begins to identify you and
[1:24:48] this becomes very personal.
[1:24:51] &gt;&gt; That's your call.
[1:24:55] &gt;&gt; He said he's the creator of that church.
[1:24:57] The heavenly bridegroom created his own
[1:24:59] bride as the spirit of God. As the
[1:25:01] spirit of God he came down and created
[1:25:04] in the virgin Mary the cells from which
[1:25:07] his body was born. He says, I want to
[1:25:09] repeat that he created the very cells in
[1:25:12] the womb of Mary for that body. I was
[1:25:15] challenged right here in the office here
[1:25:17] by one of the leaders of the Pentecostal
[1:25:19] Assemblies of Canada that he says
[1:25:21] William Brandham says that God created
[1:25:24] Jesus that Jesus was created. I said the
[1:25:27] cell the cell of uh the cell of life was
[1:25:29] created in the womb of Mary. He said oh
[1:25:32] he said he went like that just in like
[1:25:34] in disgust. Oh he said how can you
[1:25:36] believe that? And I and he I said,
[1:25:39] "Well, who was Jesus?" He said, "Jesus
[1:25:40] was God." I said, "Amen." I said, "Uh, I
[1:25:44] can say amen to that." But I said, "Did
[1:25:46] your God issue out of the womb of a
[1:25:49] woman?"
[1:25:51] He thought about that. Great big tall
[1:25:54] fellow sat back, thought about. I said,
[1:25:56] "Did your God
[1:25:58] cry out, "Father, take this cup from me
[1:26:03] if it's possible." Did your God gasp
[1:26:08] his last breaths on the cross and in
[1:26:11] fact die. Jesus Christ died.
[1:26:16] Did your God die? Did it Did your God
[1:26:18] come out of a woman a woman and die on a
[1:26:20] cross?
[1:26:23] See, then he was stumped. And I just
[1:26:25] when I say they're backpedaling, when I
[1:26:27] say that they're insecure, then I come
[1:26:30] on strong. I said, "You don't understand
[1:26:31] the Godhead. You come here to explain it
[1:26:33] to me. You don't know what it's about."
[1:26:36] Well, he says, "I'm going to get a
[1:26:37] certain certain man pastor from
[1:26:39] downtown." He says, "Would you meet with
[1:26:41] him?" He really knows the Godhead. I
[1:26:42] said, "Sure, bring him." Never did come.
[1:26:47] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:26:48] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:26:49] &gt;&gt; God started with the new creation
[1:26:51] &gt;&gt; and he stepped into it.
[1:26:53] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:26:55] &gt;&gt; The word, the logos
[1:26:57] &gt;&gt; that came out from him in the beginning
[1:27:00] and here he is on earth. Oh my goodness.
[1:27:02] I'm having a hard time stopping.
[1:27:05] There's a wonderful word we have.
[1:27:08] &gt;&gt; And he says, "And as the spirit came
[1:27:10] down was in a body was born." And then
[1:27:13] he said the uh it it was the cells in
[1:27:16] the womb of Mary for that body. It's not
[1:27:18] enough for the Holy Spirit to simply
[1:27:20] give life to human oam supplied by Mary.
[1:27:23] He said that would have been a sinful
[1:27:25] mankind producing a baby. He says that
[1:27:28] would not have produced the last Adam.
[1:27:30] of him it is said, "Lo, a body hast thou
[1:27:35] &gt;&gt; prepared for me."
[1:27:37] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. This didn't come from a man.
[1:27:40] It didn't come from Mary. It came from
[1:27:42] God. God made this body.
[1:27:44] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And God stepped into it.
[1:27:49] &gt;&gt; Mary was a human incubator. She carried
[1:27:51] that holy child and brought him to
[1:27:53] birth. It was a God man. He was the son
[1:27:56] of God. He was the new creation man. And
[1:27:59] God met and joined. He was the first of
[1:28:02] the new race. He was the head of this
[1:28:04] new race. I'm glad I'm part of that
[1:28:06] race.
[1:28:08] &gt;&gt; I'm glad I'm part of that super group.
[1:28:12] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:28:14] &gt;&gt; He's the head of the body of the church.
[1:28:16] Paul said in Colossians,
[1:28:19] therefore, if any man be in Christ, he's
[1:28:21] a new creation. And then he goes on to
[1:28:24] say, "And that you put on the new man,
[1:28:27] which after God has created in
[1:28:28] righteousness, the new creation, not the
[1:28:31] old creation made over." Hello.
[1:28:34] &gt;&gt; This is not the old creation made over.
[1:28:37] This is not the creation that came by
[1:28:39] sex that's just fixed up.
[1:28:43] &gt;&gt; Want to say amen to that?
[1:28:45] &gt;&gt; It's not just something that's patched
[1:28:46] up,
[1:28:47] &gt;&gt; something that came through the human
[1:28:49] race and it's just fixed up. This is a
[1:28:51] new creation. You're in the new
[1:28:53] creation. He called you in the new
[1:28:56] creation.
[1:28:57] &gt;&gt; Amen. And it's another creation. He
[1:29:00] said, distinct from the old one. Oh,
[1:29:02] thank God. I feel like doing a dance.
[1:29:06] &gt;&gt; It's a new creation. Distinct from the
[1:29:09] old creation.
[1:29:10] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:29:13] Brother Wesley had Wesley had brought
[1:29:16] some young people down from up from
[1:29:18] Georgia and a young man gave his life to
[1:29:21] Christ in the Sunday night meeting right
[1:29:23] while the preaching was on. He just
[1:29:25] surrendered his life and gave his life
[1:29:27] to Christ. Been coming to church at
[1:29:28] brother Dutch Scott's there a little bit
[1:29:30] and and uh announced to me after the
[1:29:32] service he said, "Grandpa, why don't you
[1:29:34] shake hands with him?" He said he he
[1:29:36] received Christ while you were
[1:29:38] preaching. Oh my goodness. become a new
[1:29:41] creation. Not an old creation fixed up,
[1:29:44] &gt;&gt; not part of the old creation.
[1:29:47] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:29:49] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:29:52] &gt;&gt; And he goes on to say, if I can just my
[1:29:55] my I'm trying to rush through here. It's
[1:29:58] another creation distinct from the old
[1:29:59] one. No longer is he dealing by the ways
[1:30:03] of the flesh. That was how he dealt with
[1:30:05] Israel. He chose Abraham and of
[1:30:07] Abraham's issue through the godly Isaac
[1:30:09] line. But now out of every kindred,
[1:30:12] tribe and nation, he has purposed a new
[1:30:14] creation. He is the first of that
[1:30:17] creation. He was God created in the form
[1:30:20] of a man of man. And now by his spirit,
[1:30:23] he is creating many sons unto himself.
[1:30:26] God the creator creating himself a part
[1:30:29] of his creation.
[1:30:32] &gt;&gt; This is the true revelation of God. He
[1:30:34] said
[1:30:35] &gt;&gt; this was his purpose. This purpose, this
[1:30:38] purpose took form through election. That
[1:30:41] is why he could look down through to the
[1:30:44] last stage. Hello. Here we are, father.
[1:30:47] &gt;&gt; Here we are. He could look through to
[1:30:49] the last stage. He says he sees you
[1:30:51] sitting here on a Wednesday evening.
[1:30:54] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:30:56] &gt;&gt; He can look down to this last age. right
[1:30:58] down to this last age when all would be
[1:31:01] over and see himself still in the midst
[1:31:04] of the church as author of his new
[1:31:06] creation, the new creation of God. His
[1:31:09] sovereign power brought it to pass and
[1:31:11] by his own decree he elected the members
[1:31:15] of his new cre of this new creation. He
[1:31:17] predestinated them to the adoption of
[1:31:20] children according to his good pleasure.
[1:31:23] Hallelujah. Thou art my beloved son.
[1:31:26] &gt;&gt; You're in that son. You're in that word,
[1:31:29] united with him. And by his omniscience
[1:31:32] and omn omnipotence, he brought it to
[1:31:34] pass. How else could he know that he
[1:31:37] would be standing in the midst of the
[1:31:38] church, receiving glory from his
[1:31:40] brethren, if he did not make sure all
[1:31:44] things he knew, and all things he worked
[1:31:46] out according to what he knew in order
[1:31:49] that his purpose and good pleasure be
[1:31:51] brought to pass. And then he goes, "In
[1:31:53] whom also we have obtained an
[1:31:55] inheritance, being predestinated
[1:31:58] according to the purpose of him who
[1:32:01] workketh all things after the council of
[1:32:03] his own good will."
[1:32:05] Amen. And lo, a voice from heaven. This
[1:32:10] is Matthew 3:17, which we read, "This is
[1:32:13] my beloved son in whom I'm well
[1:32:16] pleased." And while they yet spake,
[1:32:20] while he yet spake, behold, as Peter was
[1:32:22] speaking,
[1:32:24] just speaking some words, let's build
[1:32:25] three tabernacles. And while he spake,
[1:32:30] uh, cloud overshadowed them. And behold,
[1:32:33] a voice. This is my beloved son in whom
[1:32:36] I'm well pleased. Hear ye him. And when
[1:32:40] he be to speak, a race of people came
[1:32:44] out of it.
[1:32:46] Hallelujah.
[1:32:47] &gt;&gt; A super race of people.
[1:32:49] &gt;&gt; I don't have to pump you up. That's what
[1:32:51] he said.
[1:32:52] &gt;&gt; That's what he said. I only try to get
[1:32:54] you to believe it. I try to convince
[1:32:56] myself. This old doubting mind. You need
[1:33:00] to believe that. Biscll
[1:33:02] &gt;&gt; and everybody on internet hears that.
[1:33:06] &gt;&gt; And I say to you, you need to believe
[1:33:08] it.
[1:33:08] &gt;&gt; And you on internet, you need to believe
[1:33:10] it.
[1:33:11] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. He said it's a super race
[1:33:13] and the devil will do everything to cut
[1:33:16] that down.
[1:33:28] &gt;&gt; Can I read a couple more things just
[1:33:30] before I close?
[1:33:42] the the the term accepted
[1:33:45] that you're accepted in the beloved.
[1:33:47] It's not just accepted as we we say,
[1:33:50] well, uh here's a gift. Will you accept
[1:33:54] this gift? It's not just a matter of
[1:33:56] receiving and giving. That's not the
[1:33:58] kind because the Bible speaks of it that
[1:34:01] they heard the gospel. They received it
[1:34:04] and they accepted they they accepted the
[1:34:07] word. They heard the word. They received
[1:34:09] the word. And that's exactly the same
[1:34:10] word as accepted, but not this accepted.
[1:34:13] When this one says, when Paul says
[1:34:15] you're accepted in the beloved, this is
[1:34:17] the accepted in the Greek, please. You
[1:34:20] are highly favored.
[1:34:23] To make one accepted. If you weren't,
[1:34:26] he's going to make you accepted.
[1:34:29] To pursue with grace.
[1:34:32] Oh my goodness. Think of it in your own
[1:34:36] wayward way,
[1:34:38] going your own direction as hard as you
[1:34:40] could go. This one pursued you,
[1:34:47] &gt;&gt; followed hard after you, and pursued you
[1:34:50] with grace, to compass, with favor, to
[1:34:55] honor, with blessings. And it comes from
[1:34:57] the word grace. This word accepted
[1:35:00] actually comes from the root word grace.
[1:35:03] to be accepted in the beloved, to make
[1:35:06] them, and to pursue them. But it comes
[1:35:08] from grace. Grace, that which affords
[1:35:11] joy, hello.
[1:35:13] &gt;&gt; Pleasure.
[1:35:15] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:35:16] &gt;&gt; Delight,
[1:35:17] &gt;&gt; sweetness, loveliness.
[1:35:19] &gt;&gt; It's not a dragged out,
[1:35:21] &gt;&gt; sad, sour.
[1:35:23] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:35:24] &gt;&gt; Dill pickle injection of some sort. It's
[1:35:27] not some vinegar experience. This is
[1:35:30] something that's lovely,
[1:35:32] &gt;&gt; sweet, wonderful, happy, joyful. Say,
[1:35:37] "Oh, but the pressures of the world,
[1:35:39] this is greater than the pressures of
[1:35:41] the world." Says, "I got such burdens.
[1:35:43] This is greater than I'm telling you
[1:35:45] tonight. Greater than any burden you've
[1:35:47] ever had
[1:35:48] &gt;&gt; and greater than any burden you ever
[1:35:50] will have."
[1:35:51] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:35:54] &gt;&gt; You need to accept this.
[1:35:56] &gt;&gt; You need to receive it. You need to say
[1:35:58] yay and amen
[1:36:00] &gt;&gt; to it tonight. There is no other way.
[1:36:02] &gt;&gt; You don't have any other option.
[1:36:06] &gt;&gt; Brother Brandon talking to a woman. Bear
[1:36:08] with me a few minutes. My I'm trying to
[1:36:10] close. But brother Brandham talking to a
[1:36:11] woman and and and and speaking to her.
[1:36:14] He says this is her only alternative.
[1:36:18] &gt;&gt; I never never mentioned that. Never
[1:36:21] caught it just like that. He said it's
[1:36:22] her alternative. She's accepted her
[1:36:25] alternative. And I want to say to this
[1:36:27] congregation tonight, this is your only
[1:36:30] alternative.
[1:36:31] &gt;&gt; You don't have a whole bunch of options.
[1:36:34] &gt;&gt; There isn't a whole bunch of ways to
[1:36:36] become a beloved, accepted, and received
[1:36:39] into beloved. There isn't a whole lot of
[1:36:41] ways. This is the way in the name of
[1:36:44] Jesus Christ. Walk ye in it.
[1:36:46] &gt;&gt; Amen. Receive it. Accept it. Deny
[1:36:49] everything else. Even now in your own
[1:36:51] heart, say, "I deny everything that's
[1:36:54] opposed to that.
[1:36:57] Hallelujah.
[1:36:59] &gt;&gt; You might be inclined to say, "Oh,
[1:37:00] Brother Ed, you don't know what I'm
[1:37:01] going through." I'll tell you, you don't
[1:37:03] know the burdens I bear. And the only
[1:37:05] thing that gives you sustaining grace is
[1:37:07] this.
[1:37:08] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Some of you don't even have
[1:37:10] a burden.
[1:37:11] &gt;&gt; You only got a phobe.
[1:37:13] &gt;&gt; Satan tried to put a phobe on you that
[1:37:16] you've got some great big in
[1:37:18] insurmountable thing. It's not
[1:37:20] insurmountable. I deny it in the name of
[1:37:23] Jesus Christ. Hallelujah.
[1:37:25] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Deny that phobe.
[1:37:28] &gt;&gt; Deny that thing.
[1:37:30] &gt;&gt; It's just a doubt. I'm going to preach
[1:37:32] till it's gone.
[1:37:34] &gt;&gt; Amen. So the sooner you get rid of it,
[1:37:36] the sooner I can end.
[1:37:39] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:37:41] &gt;&gt; You don't have a problem.
[1:37:43] We got the We got the source. We got the
[1:37:46] alternative.
[1:37:47] &gt;&gt; The only alternative there is. Let this
[1:37:50] congregation rise and accept it in the
[1:37:52] name of Jesus Christ. Glory to God.
[1:37:56] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:37:58] &gt;&gt; This is abundant grace.
[1:38:00] &gt;&gt; This is his grace. You are accepted in
[1:38:03] the beloved.
[1:38:05] &gt;&gt; He's not going to deny you.
[1:38:07] &gt;&gt; He's accepted you. When he called you,
[1:38:09] he accepted you.
[1:38:11] &gt;&gt; You're accepted in the beloved.
[1:38:14] &gt;&gt; What a joy. What a glorious position to
[1:38:16] be in.
[1:38:17] &gt;&gt; Oh, hallelujah.
[1:38:19] Hallelujah.
[1:38:21] &gt;&gt; Why don't we just stand? We're thanking
[1:38:23] him. Glory.
[1:38:31] &gt;&gt; I heard some heard some comments that
[1:38:33] Brother Tony was making when he came up
[1:38:35] to pray and I thought it was so striking
[1:38:39] because there were just so much like uh
[1:38:43] a quote that I had here and I've got to
[1:38:45] close with this quote. That's our
[1:38:47] position of a believer in Christ. He
[1:38:50] says, "And through the blood, washing of
[1:38:52] the blood, taking away, separating of
[1:38:55] sin." That the Holy Spirit woos the
[1:38:59] believer. He's pursued you and he woos
[1:39:01] you. He woos the believer through the
[1:39:04] blood.
[1:39:06] &gt;&gt; Cleansing. cleansing of the soul into
[1:39:09] the fellowship into the spirit life
[1:39:13] inside Christ inside with Christ.
[1:39:18] &gt;&gt; He woos you. That's what he's doing
[1:39:20] tonight. That's why I'm preaching. The
[1:39:22] Holy Spirit is wooing you
[1:39:24] &gt;&gt; to fellowship through the blood into
[1:39:28] Christ.
[1:39:29] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:39:30] &gt;&gt; And he says, he says this, "Shut out the
[1:39:33] world. The very nature of God is in you.
[1:39:37] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen each time? Each time it
[1:39:40] registers, still subject to mistakes,
[1:39:44] &gt;&gt; but God can't see it
[1:39:46] &gt;&gt; because it's covered by the blood.
[1:39:49] &gt;&gt; God can't see through the blood.
[1:39:52] &gt;&gt; Every time he looks through the blood,
[1:39:54] it looks white.
[1:39:55] &gt;&gt; He looks through the blood, it looks
[1:39:57] white. He said again, so of God was so
[1:40:00] pleased with Christ till he accepted him
[1:40:05] and said, "This is my beloved son in
[1:40:07] whom I'm well pleased." And through
[1:40:10] Christ being the perfect one, us dead to
[1:40:13] our own thoughts and ideas, being born
[1:40:16] of the spirit of God, walking not after
[1:40:19] the theology, but after the spirit
[1:40:22] inside of us. Then let the dead, let the
[1:40:26] dead in Christ walk not after the things
[1:40:28] of the world, but after the things of
[1:40:30] the spirit.
[1:40:32] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. So he says, "So, so you're
[1:40:36] inside of Christ."
[1:40:39] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:40:40] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:40:41] &gt;&gt; And in him, you're accepted
[1:40:44] &gt;&gt; into beloved.
[1:40:46] &gt;&gt; Oh, how wonderful.
[1:40:47] &gt;&gt; Glory. Glory to God. How we thank you,
[1:40:51] Lord. Bless your people. Bless the super
[1:40:54] race. Bless this virtuous bride. Oh God,
[1:40:58] those that still may feel a twinge of
[1:41:01] something negative in their heart, I
[1:41:03] pray that you'll bind it up.
[1:41:05] &gt;&gt; I pray that you'll cast it out. And
[1:41:08] every spirit of hell that would try to
[1:41:11] utter a lie to your people. I pray you
[1:41:14] will cut off his breath and cut off his
[1:41:16] words and cut off his attempt to speak
[1:41:19] to the people of God. In the name of
[1:41:21] Jesus Christ as a servant of Christ and
[1:41:24] the church of the living God, we cast
[1:41:26] him out.
[1:41:30] &gt;&gt; Victory in Jesus.
[1:41:32] &gt;&gt; Victory in this beloved one.
[1:41:34] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:41:36] &gt;&gt; What a glorious Christ.
[1:41:40] &gt;&gt; Glory to God.
[1:41:42] Blessed be his name.

[1:44:28] when you when you give him praise and
[1:44:30] thanksgiving. We're magnifying him.
[1:44:33] We're magnifying his sacrifice at
[1:44:36] Calvary where he bought us and now came
[1:44:38] and redeemed us and claimed us to his
[1:44:41] own.
[1:44:42] Let's say also he looked beyond our
[1:44:44] fault and saw our need.

[1:47:01] [Music]
[1:47:14] [Music]
[1:47:17] is one of our brothers and his wife that
[1:47:18] are going to be traveling east. They've
[1:47:21] not had their family dedicated. Would we
[1:47:24] have just a few minutes while Brother
[1:47:26] Tom prays a prayer of dedication on
[1:47:28] them? I wanted Brother Roberto and
[1:47:30] sister uh Mary, would you please come
[1:47:33] bring the children here while we sing it
[1:47:35] once again.
[1:47:37] faith and the other one I have its name
[1:47:41] here written down too by the time you
[1:47:45] come and do this dedication. I shall for
[1:47:51] [Music]
[1:47:58] &gt;&gt; God bless you.
[1:48:02] [Music]
[1:48:09] died for me.
[1:48:11] [Music]
[1:48:14] [Applause]
[1:48:16] That grace that my falling soul
[1:48:23] [Music]
[1:48:25] beyond
[1:48:28] my fall and
[1:48:31] my
[1:48:34] Let's just remain standing while we have
[1:48:36] this prayer dedication.
[1:48:41] We indeed have time
[1:48:44] &gt;&gt; for this is a part of the family of God
[1:48:46] that the Lord himself has has dealt
[1:48:50] wonderfully with
[1:48:53] in Mark 10
[1:48:55] verse 13 and verse 14.
[1:49:00] The disciples
[1:49:03] wanted to keep the little children away.
[1:49:06] Lord is just too busy. He said, "Suffer
[1:49:08] the little children to come to me."
[1:49:12] And so when I was in prayer,
[1:49:14] Brother Roberto, Sister Rosemary, before
[1:49:17] the service,
[1:49:19] Lord just dropped a a little thought in
[1:49:21] my heart out of the token message.
[1:49:24] Go see how the prophet dedicated the
[1:49:26] family in the token message.
[1:49:30] So just at the time
[1:49:33] at the ending of the service, brother
[1:49:36] Ram said, "Here's now here's a little
[1:49:37] family, our heavenly father." And he
[1:49:41] mentions Michael and he takes a little
[1:49:43] son and their little daughter.
[1:49:47] And he says, "I lay hands on them."
[1:49:51] No different than Jesus or like Paul. I
[1:49:54] lay hands on them. I dedicate them. I
[1:49:57] lay my hands on them, Lord. May this
[1:50:00] little girl's life, he said, be blessed
[1:50:02] in the kingdom of God. Blessed father,
[1:50:04] blessed mother. May they live long
[1:50:06] lives, happy, see their children in the
[1:50:09] service of God. We ask the blessing. We
[1:50:12] dedicate this family. And I thought, how
[1:50:15] appropriate, brother Roberto, at token
[1:50:18] time, token hour, that we as a people,
[1:50:21] we also can pray that prayer upon this
[1:50:24] little family. God's dealt with brother
[1:50:26] Roberto, Sister Rosemary, and and now
[1:50:30] we've got Desmond, and we have faith.
[1:50:32] They're asking that we would dedicate
[1:50:34] them before the Lord. Let's do that as a
[1:50:36] congregation in the presence of God.
[1:50:45] Heavenly Father,
[1:50:49] [Music]
[1:50:57] &gt;&gt; I'm asking Lord that as I
[1:51:02] prot
[1:51:08] you this evening. We've heard your word.
[1:51:12] We're a part of that new creation.
[1:51:14] &gt;&gt; Part of the word as creator. Lord,
[1:51:17] &gt;&gt; I just pray that you'll keep your hand
[1:51:19] upon this family, upon these children as
[1:51:23] mother and daddy stand here.
[1:51:25] &gt;&gt; I pray, Father God, that you will
[1:51:27] receive these children in the name of
[1:51:30] Jesus Christ. Bless brother,
[1:51:34] &gt;&gt; sister Rosemary, make their church.
[1:51:37] May they see Lord Jesus Christ on
[1:51:40] display we pray
[1:51:42] &gt;&gt; in Jesus name.
[1:51:44] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:51:45] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:51:52] &gt;&gt; God bless you. Sister Rosemary. God
[1:51:54] bless you darling. I shall forever I
[1:51:58] just last. I shall forever.
[1:52:07] my eyes to brother and
[1:52:13] to the cross
[1:52:17] where Jesus died for me.
[1:52:24] How much
[1:52:29] the grace that caught my falling soul.
[1:52:37] He looks beyond
[1:52:42] my father and
[1:52:45] mighty.
[1:52:50] God bless you bride of Jesus Christ.
[1:52:52] give you a safe journey home this night
[1:52:54] tonight. Drive safely on the roads that
[1:52:58] may be a little bit icy.
[1:53:02] We don't know if we'll see tomorrow, but
[1:53:05] I want to I want to make your a promise
[1:53:08] by grace by grace we'll meet. If not
[1:53:13] here, we'll meet at the supper table.
[1:53:16] &gt;&gt; Amen. Is that your hope?
[1:53:19] &gt;&gt; Is that your faith?
[1:53:20] &gt;&gt; Is that your claim? We're going to ask
[1:53:22] brother Andy's to ask God's blessings
[1:53:25] upon us. God bless you, brother Andes.
[1:53:28] Amen.
[1:53:32] &gt;&gt; Our lovely Lord Jesus, words would fail
[1:53:35] us to ever be able to express our
[1:53:38] gratitude for what you've done in our
[1:53:40] lives. this great great
[1:53:45] salvation
[1:53:46] that you have planned in your own mind
[1:53:50] before the foundations of the world and
[1:53:53] included us and even then we were
[1:53:56] accepted in you Lord. Thank you, Lord
[1:53:59] Jesus, for this wonderful work of grace
[1:54:02] and mercy as you've come down in our
[1:54:04] day, us as little children, and you've
[1:54:08] predestinated that we'd be upon the
[1:54:10] earth. You've predestinated our entire
[1:54:13] lives that we would hear this word, this
[1:54:16] delivering word and the blood of Christ,
[1:54:19] the bleeding word, the living word, the
[1:54:21] creative word, and how it's worked in
[1:54:24] our lives, even to bring us to this
[1:54:26] hour, to this service, to hear this
[1:54:29] message tonight, and out on the
[1:54:31] internet, those that's participated in
[1:54:34] this time of worship. Lord, you have
[1:54:35] ordained it. And we pray God, even
[1:54:38] though this night can never be repeated,
[1:54:41] we're asking Lord that you will make it
[1:54:43] a milestone, make it a foundational
[1:54:46] evening for us, Lord. that you will
[1:54:49] build within us the tabernacle of the
[1:54:52] living God, even a powerhouse in each
[1:54:55] life, Lord, to be the very powerhouse as
[1:54:58] your prophet said, bringing forth life
[1:55:01] and virtue into this dying world and
[1:55:04] literally bringing forth additional sons
[1:55:07] and daughters of God by our influence
[1:55:11] and by our lifegiving efforts of
[1:55:14] surrendering to you, Lord. Thus every
[1:55:17] family, every man and woman but boy and
[1:55:19] girl. We pray heavenly father that this
[1:55:22] church as well as other message churches
[1:55:25] throughout the world but we being a part
[1:55:27] of this assembly Lord God would be an
[1:55:30] example in in our homes and our
[1:55:33] individual lives. And Lord that this
[1:55:35] assembly would be an example of the New
[1:55:38] Testament church in power and in
[1:55:41] deliverance. Lord, bless us, Lord, in
[1:55:44] Jesus Christ's name. As we know that we
[1:55:47] are blessed in the beloved. We ask, Lord
[1:55:50] Jesus, your blessing upon us, Lord,
[1:55:52] until we're able to gather again here
[1:55:56] before you this coming Lord's day. In
[1:55:59] the name of Jesus Christ, we ask this
[1:56:02] blessing and give you praise and
[1:56:04] thanksgiving.
