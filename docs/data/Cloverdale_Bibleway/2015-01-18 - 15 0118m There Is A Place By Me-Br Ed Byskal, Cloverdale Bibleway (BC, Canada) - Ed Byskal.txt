This atmosphere of praise and worship, I'm just going to ask Brother Tom to come and take us to the throne of grace. There's a number of prayer requests and testimonies. Sister Leverne Clemens wants to give God all the glory for what he's done in her life and the tests have come back and in in uh she's in good health. Her heart's back in rhythm and we just want to really give praise. She wants to thank the saints for praying. Oh, praise for the healing power of God. We worship you, oh God. Thank you for touching our sister, Lord Jesus. Thank you, Lord. Brother Norm Wood writes and Sister Louise says, "Thank you all for your prayers since Monday when she was not able to get out of bed without severe pain and assistance to today. She can get up and walk on her own. She still has pain and in her legs and hip and continues [Music] having uh so she's she continues having trouble doing stairs, but we just want to continue to remember to to remember her in prayer and we just thank God for raising her up and strengthening her and we just appreciate our sister. We want to continue to remember in prayer and there's many prayer requests here. Um brother Randy Snow, please remember a a young man named Victor. He has a tumor that is cancerous. would like to have the church remember him in prayer. Uh prayer request from brother David Daniels for his youngest sister Kathy Thompson been diagnosed with breast cancer breast cancer. Please remember her in prayer.

And um prayer request from Sister Helen Bisberger for Sister Glattus who's going into surgery on Monday to remove the steel pin from her arm and she just wants God to intervene and and take control during the surgery. So we just want to remember these requests before the throne of grace. Our God is faithful. He is our high priest. We have an advocate with the father and it's Jesus Christ the righteous. We're so thankful for that. Just want to ask brother Tom now to come and take us to the throne of grace. [Music] How many have personal needs this morning? You have your own personal needs. Amen. Amen. Heavenly Father, as we approach the very throne of grace this morning, we want to indeed give you all the glory, all the honor, and all the praise. We have a great love for you, Lord, for you reached down your hand. We can say individually for me. When I was lost and undone without God or a son, mercy stepped in, Lord, the love of God reached down and transformed our souls. Lord, we want to come to the house of God with thanksgiving on our lips to praise the most holy one, the glorious one, the great I am, the alpha, and the omega. We love you, Lord, this morning, asking God that as these hands were raised, that you would come down to their address, that the word itself would come through the servant of God this morning, our pastor, where the word of God was sent to heal the people. Heal us once again, Lord. Let the glory of God come down within this little assembly this morning. And pass me not, oh gentle Savior, hear my humble cry, while in others thou art dealing with and calling. Don't pass me by, Lord. Speak deeply to my own soul. And Lord, these needs that our brother Nathan has read, Lord, you knew them before they were ever penned down. For you are omnipotent God. Father, you can be touched by the feeling of our infirmity this morning. And by faith, we reach out to the promise of God. To them that believe, Lord, you're our healer. To them that believe you're our deliverer. To them that believe, Lord, you're their savior. God, would you move on our behalf this morning as we collectively join our hearts together to give you all the glory and honor. Do your holy name. Bless the servant of God this morning, Lord. Anoint brother Ed and let the word of God find its place within our lives. Lord, may our hearts be good ground this morning. May the seed of God be planted and may it bring forth, Lord, more than we could even ask or think, Lord. And Father, as we now take up this offering this morning, we pray, Father, that you will bless the giver, that you will multiply it and break it down, Lord, and use it for the glory of God. Lord, we commit the song service. We commit the service to you, praying God, thy divine will be done in Jesus' name. Amen. &gt;&gt; Thank you, brother Tom. You may have your seats as the deacons take up the offering this morning. Just let's just sing I am redeemed bought with a price. I am redeemed bought with the price. Jesus has changed my whole life. If anybody asks you just who I am telling I am reading verse one where there was a found where What confusion peace now reign I'm walking with Jesus I'm a child of Jes and it's all because that I am I am part of Christ. Jesus has changed my whole life. Oh, if anybody else I am, tell them I am. I'll tell of his favor, tell of his precious love. I'll tell of his goodness to me. He purchased my redemption with his own precious blood and from sin I've been set free. Oh, and I am free. I'm bought away. [Music] Jesus has changed my whole life. If anybody asks you just who I am, tell them I am free. [Music] Amen. I'm so thankful for the great plan of redemption that I am a part of it and that I'm associated with people that are a part of the plan of redemption. I never get tired of singing about the cross and about redemption because wow, where would I be without redemption? Amen. Where would I be without the blood? &gt;&gt; Praise God. &gt;&gt; I kind of get emotional when I sing about the cross and but I just want to give thanks to the Lord. We got a few announcements you want to make before we continue on. And um brother Mike Ray has um let me know there's the winter camp registration is on the website and it is due by February 17th.

We just want to welcome you and make you feel at home and trust that you feel welcome and that you feel the presence of God. And um let's sing a song together. When pangs of death seized on my soul, I would not be denied. When pangs of death seized on my soul unto the Lord I cried. Till Jesus came and made me whole. I would not be denied. I would not be denied. I would not be denied till Jesus came and made me whole. I would not be down at Jacob in the days before I wrestled with the Lord. And it says when I cate I stood upon you. Oh, I was not denied. I would not be till Jesus came and made me. Oh, I will not be denied. Oh, my Lord was gone and could not hear my prayer. But praise the Lord for the work he done and Christ glory. Oh, I would not be. I would not be till Jesus came and made me whole. I would not be. Now, I want to sing verse three again cuz I just love pushing Satan's nose in the word of God. &gt;&gt; He says, "My Lord is gone and he's not going to hear me, but I know the Father has said that he hears and he answers prayer." Amen. He never leaves us or forsakes us, but he's going to be with us until the end of the world. Amen. So, let's stand up and let's push Satan's nose into the word of God cuz that's what we're here to do. We're here to be overcomers in the name of the Lord Jesus because he is victorious and he's living inside of us. And therefore, we are victorious with Christ Jesus who is our Lord and Savior. Amen. Oh, Satan said, "My Lord was gone and would not hear my prayer. But praise the Lord, the work is done. And Christ the Lord is here. And I would not be denied. I would not be denied. Till Jesus came and made me whole. I would not be denied. Oh, I would not be denied. I would not be denied. Till Jesus came and made me whole, I would not be denied. Hallelujah. Let's sing. He leadth me, oh blessed rock. Amen. He leadth me. Oh blessed. Oh worship with heavenly comfort. Whatever I need, wherever I need, still his God hand that leadth to me. He leadth me. He leadth me by his own hand. He leadth me. His faithful follower I would be for by his hand. [Music] Sometimes missile, sometimes where the blue by water or trles see his hand that leadth me. He leadth me. He leadth me by his own hand. He lead me. His faithful power I would be for his lead. Lord, I will thy hand in mine forever glorifying whatever lost I [Music] God that leadth to me. Oh, he let me He leadth me by his own lead. His faithful power. I was looked for by him and he made it. And when my task on earth is done, when by thy grace the visionary won. Even death away I will not flee. S God reorded me. He leadth meth [Music] by his own lead. his faithful followower I would be for by him and he leadth me. Thank you Lord. Thank you Lord. As our pastor comes, let's just sing a verse and a chorus of blessed assurance. Jesus is mine. Oh, what an assurance we have. Amen. We're holding to God's unchanging hand. He's taking us through all the way. Amen. Blessed assurance. Jesus is mine. Oh, what a foreign glory divine. I'm an air of salvation, purchase of God, [Music] born of his spirit and washed in his blood. This is my story. [Music] [Applause] This is my song. Praising my savior all the day long. This is my song. This is my song. My [Music] Amen. &gt;&gt; Are y'all feeling all right? &gt;&gt; Good. I am too. &gt;&gt; It's a wonderful to come into the house of God and I hope you came expecting something. Lord, &gt;&gt; Amen. I just want to make a a couple of announcements before we go any further. Brother Caumbi from Congo is arriving here to be with brother Toby, Sister Rebecca, and their family. He's arriving on February the 9th. And so we'll be uh privileged and delighted to have him speak. uh maybe once or twice, maybe the 15th and the 22nd. So you can just bear that in mind. Brother Caillou will be here. Blessed us immensely the times he's been here. A man with depth of the word, pastor of a very substantial church in Mabu Jamaaya in Congo and uh we've spoken there at his church and it's a wonderful atmosphere. So we're very very happy. I can tell you that there's a a lot of places that would uh indeed like to have him. Uh for those of you that may have received a little email or a mail from Brother Norm Wood, uh we're happy to hear that there's improvement for Sister Louise. And uh and her diabetes is reducing every day. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. and uh she had a terrible suffering with her knees and and and so on and got strained or sprained and uh there's nothing too small and nothing too great but what God is concerned about us uh I know that you're standing I'm going to be standing much longer but um there are some things that I've been impressed with and some things that I would like to see achieved this morning. Something that I'm going to just give you a personal craving that I've had on my heart and that is uh I was in the meetings that brother Brandham conducted and uh people that haven't been in the meetings might think well oh they were just so spectacular. Well, they were something like this meeting. But he would say often if God can do something through me to increase your faith to accept the son of God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He said on another time, I trust that God will do something that'll increase your faith so that you can be healed. The Lord bless you, he said. And now may he greatly increase your faith, but that he might increase your faith that Jesus has raised from the dead. Those are just it's no use us giving you a quote unless that God comes and visits you. That's what I pray for. That's what I crave for. It's not just uh sufficient for you to know something that happened 40, 50, 60 years ago or 2,000 years ago or earlier. We could go to the Old Testament. We could go to the New Testament and we can go into the prophet's ministry. But what is absolutely essential and it's I feel a very very heavy responsibility because it's largely the ministry's responsibility to preach the word in such a way so that we're not happy and satisfied when we leave the pulpit but that your faith has been increased and something happens. And so that's that's my desire today. And I want you to really focus yourself in that direction. God, what would you have me to do? How? Help me to increase my faith. Help me to listen in such a way. Help me to be exercised. And just on the way to the church, you know, the this is Satan's Eden. You understand? Okay. We have a lot of things that are provided in uh in the world that actually dilute our faith. One is I'm wearing glasses and if you see that I take them off, it's because I don't want the expression on the people to bother me. [Music] Uh but if there's something wrong with our eyes, we don't get we don't have desperation over that anymore. because we can go to an optometrist and our faith is diluted because we don't have desperation. In Jesus day, they didn't have glasses in Jesus day. Today, if we run out of money, uh we don't get a desperate because we got a credit card or a line of credit or something. But in those days, it was desperation. And today we don't have desperation for a lot of things because we got pharmacies and doctors and all those things. I'm not against them. I I'm I'm actually for doctors and whatever more so they can tell us what we need to know and maybe things we need to do that we're not doing. This life has us on a treadmill has us has us at a pace that's not God's pace. That's our pace. And so we need to adjust ourselves and we're here in church. Well, now we have the musicians and the song leader and so on so forth. We expect that. What else do you expect? Well, we expect that somebody's going to come out and preach. And do you expect anything more? Well, maybe desperation hasn't set in, &gt;&gt; but I find in the Bible when people called out, &gt;&gt; cried out to God, we must have this, meet me, and we find different ones that have desperation and God has done something. our sister Clement right here, Sister Leverne. God has met her on a number of occasions. And I don't know whether I would do this or not, but uh Brother Steven, Sister Tracy Rivas came to the front of the church about 3 4 weeks ago, 3 weeks ago or so, I don't know. And uh and Sister Tracy just told about uh an examination that she had and they thought there might be a tumor and they're going to you know and of course that leaves a person anybody has a wife and a mother or whatever more you have some concerns about that. And anyway, they dealt with that this last week and we had prayer here and the doctor said the tumor's dying and started dying about 3 weeks ago. Could we say glory to God? [Applause] And so to have our sister Louise Woods improving doesn't surprise me at all. And I look back and see we had a wonderful testimony. I to me it's a wonderful testimony. Brother Darren, you and uh Sister Roxan and that night of the service I was watching you down here. And I saw Sister Roxan just step out in the aisle and I was looking for the rest of your family. And I didn't know why. I was just uh you know had a I I wasn't concerned but I just and uh and God gave us I believe a mighty victory. Why are we here? Number one, I pray that the preaching of the word will increase your faith. I pray that something will in you will activate his presence for you. You don't have to bring it down. It's here. Amen. Let's pray. Heavenly Father, we're standing in your presence, fully aware that man can do nothing. As a prophet of God would say, "I'm as helpless as can be." We are helpless. But you are almighty. You can do anything. and all things are possible to them that believe. And we do not want to be a people that limit you. You have risen from the dead. You have manifested yourself. You have declared yourself. You have interpreted your word. And we're here, oh God, as your elected people, not because we say so, because you have chosen that we should hear your voice. And your voice was quickened to us. And now we pray that that quickening will continue today and you'll do what you wish to do and what you desire to do. We simply pre present ourselves to you. Father, thy will be done on earth as it is in heaven in Jesus Christ's name for your glory. Amen. &gt;&gt; Take your Bibles, please, and uh turn to Exodus the 3 chapter. Thank you for standing and being patient. Thank you musicians and brother Nathan. I'm going to begin reading at the second verse of the third chapter. And the angel of the Lord appeared unto him in a flame of fire out of the midst of a bush. And he looked, and behold, the bush burned with fire, and the bush was not consumed. And Moses said, I will turn now aside, and see this great sight, why the bush is not burnt. And when the Lord saw that he turned aside to see, God called unto him out of the midst of the bush and said, "Moses, Moses." And he said, "Here am I." And he said, "Draw not nigh hither. Put off thy shoes from off thy feet. For the place whereon thou standest is holy ground." Moreover, he said, I am the God of thy father, the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob. And Moses hid his face, for he was afraid to look upon God. There's a another verse that I'll just read it. And uh Moses later on asked to see God's face and someone ministering here talked about show me thy glory brother Tim Dodd I believe and the Lord said and this is you can just listen please Exodus 33 and 21 and the Lord said behold there is a place by me and thou shalt stand upon a rock. And that is my text this morning. And the title of this message is there is a place by me. You may just have your seats reverently. I want to have you have as little movement around as possible. I'm going to show just one slide if it's ready please. A place can be a country, can be a city, a town, a home, can be this church. A place can also be a condition. If you're sick this morning, that's one situation. If you're made healthy, you're in another state. You're in another place. I'm healthy. A person could be have plenty or they could be in a famine. And those are different places. A person may be righteous or they may be wicked. And those are certainly two different places. And all of us here we talk about where we used to be, where we were when God found us. That was certainly a different place than where we are today. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. and the kind of language we used and the kind of things we enjoyed. The things we once loved we hate &gt;&gt; and the things perhaps that we didn't care for or hated we now love. We're different people &gt;&gt; and in a different place. A place can also be a destiny. I go to prepare a place for you. Jesus said, and the Bible says also, Judas by transgression fell that he might go to his own place, a place in a book. And in Luke the 4th chapter, the Bible tells us, "And when he had opened the book, he found the place where it was written, and he said, this day is this scripture fulfilled." So the place and the scripture come crashing together. &gt;&gt; There was another instance which I will refer to in the message later on. I'm just giving you this to initiate the service. There was a place where the the Philip the evangelist had been having a great in a great time of moving of the spirit of God and great things were happening in the book of acts and God spoke to him and said you go to a desert place. He went out in a desert and there was a man very very a man h a man of stature, a man of integrity, a unic uh uh over all the treasure of the queen of Ethiopia, Candice, and he was he was reading he had a scriptures he was reading in a certain place &gt;&gt; in the scripture he didn't find the place. He was just reading there and he didn't really know anything about what was going on. He didn't know that God was doing something supernatural on his behalf. Might be you this morning. And he was reading in the scripture and he was wounded for our transgressions and he was bruised. He's led as a lamb to the slaughter. And Philip steps up into his chariot and he says, "Do you understand what you're reading?" He said, "How can I understand except somebody tell me how can how can people have faith unless they hear the preaching? &gt;&gt; For faith cometh by hearing and hearing by the word of God. So we want to make certain that our ears aren't affected by something in this life." &gt;&gt; Amen. So there was a place in the book and there's a many other instances where a place relates and I may touch on some of them as we go on. Uh a common phrase we hear places where the heart is. We have a lot of young people and children here from the school and there was a a young girl in uh sixth grade and I she addressed this and she wrote this. Home is the place where family is where the celebrations, get togethers and the heart is the place where you always feel safe and loved. A home is a place where you are always welcomed and wanted. A home is a place to keep you warm when it's cold and a place to be happy or sad. A place where there is food and water to eat and drink. My home is a loving, safe, and caring place that I'm proud to call my home. If your house is the same way, then it is a home because home is where the heart is. I thought when I was reading that, I thought, you know, we're we're we're your children. We're going to come here. We feel warm and comfortable, &gt;&gt; safe, protected. &gt;&gt; Fed. &gt;&gt; There's water to drink, &gt;&gt; food to eat, &gt;&gt; somebody that cares for us. &gt;&gt; We feel welcomed. Hallelujah. What a wonderful presence. How a prophet would say to the people, you are a Christian because I feel a welcome spirit. &gt;&gt; Home is where the heart is. We read of Moses and now I'm just starting and I'll appreciate your full attention. This is a special message for me. It's a special message. Moses had stood in the palaces of Egypt. Moses had stood and was in a position to be a pharaoh. Moses was the son of Pharaoh's daughter. He stood at the top. He was by the brother Brandham said he was a genius. He taught the teachers of Egypt. That's a place he was in. &gt;&gt; He was respected. He was renowned. He was he was a man that had attained. We don't want to just dream its way out of our place, but you're not where you were a few years ago. &gt;&gt; Not just spiritually, but perhaps materially or whatever. And and the world may have handed you a uh you know a good hand. It may have handed you a difficult hand. Uh we don't we don't desire to be sick but sometime we get sick. We don't desire to be discouraged but sometime we get discouraged. Sometime we fall into despondency and we don't know why. &gt;&gt; I don't believe I've ever told this over the pulpit and I know it's on the internet and to be around the world. But you know, you you you see me standing here ministering and the other ministers, I can't speak for them, but I once went to my doctor, a family doctors quite a number of years ago. And uh I go to a doctor because he knows something about our our anatomy and our system. And sometime we're doing the wrong thing. We're sometime we're doing exactly the opposite thing that we should be doing. And I had really thought about this and I stepped into the doctor's office and then they brought me into the waiting room. And so I'm sitting there in a little examination room and in comes a doctor, Dr. Forester. There's an old British doctor. Oh, he said, "How are you, Mr. Besco?" I said, "Fine." Oh, he said, "That sounds good." He said, "What can I do for you today?" And I said, "Well, you know, I really don't know." I said, "I just like to talk to you. Is that possible?" Oh. Fine. So, he jumped up on the examination table and just let his feet dangle. And he said, "What would you like to talk about?" I said, "Well, I said, I don't know what's going on really." I said, "I I I don't know what really I want to talk about." I said, "Uh, you know," I said, "I like fishing. For me to think of putting a line in the water right now is just utterly repulsive. Said my wife and I, we've traveled all over the world in different places and we've seen a lot of beautiful places. I can't think of a place that I have a remote desire to be in. Said I like to hunt. I don't I don't care to hunt. I don't want to go any place. I said I have a wonderful home and wife and family and everything is just wonderful at home. But I said I don't get any enjoyment. I don't get any satisfaction from it. I said and I I I I only held back one thing and that is how I feel when I'm behind the pulpit. I held that back from him because that's not in the medical field. And I said, uh, I I said, I I don't really, I said, there isn't anything that I can think of that I would desire to do. And I and then I stopped and I said I said, "Doctor, does this make any sense to you?" Oh, he said, "Absolutely." I said, "What is it?" He said, "Exhaustion. You're exhausted." He said, "And I am ordering you on eight weeks rest." Well, I had eight days because I had a wedding coming up in eight days and it wasn't a rest. But I had eight days and at least I learned a very valuable lesson, you know, and that's why the prophet even had Sam there and he would just go and talk to Sam and they would sit down. They've been friends since they were children as a boys. And sometime we need to hear something because we don't we don't always understand what's going on in our in our system in our family or in our life. We don't understand it. But God knows it &gt;&gt; a lot better than the family doctor. &gt;&gt; And you might be in that situation where you haven't got everything in your life figured out, but God's got it figured out. Moses as I said it was he was born in a home of slaves. So one day that was his place and then he was put in a basket of bull rushes as a child as a baby and sent down the river Nile River and that was his place. And then he was found by the maidens and then he went into Pharaoh's palaces and that was his place. And then he had something going on inside that he was not content or satisfied with that. And we get into that position also because maybe even where you are spiritually that's not your place. God has something more for us. The church was in a certain condition and and it's described it was described in Revelation. It was uh in need of nothing, but they didn't know they were very needy. &gt;&gt; I want you just to hold that. And Moses, he he because he acted on behalf of the burden of his heart. The prophet said he looked out the same window Pharaoh looked out. Pharaoh saw them as mudbers. Moses saw them as brethren. He went and they didn't understand. He was he was trying to liberate them with this military might and strength and slew a man and uh as a result of that he became a vagabond and brother Vandom calls him all the time a runaway prophet. Sometimes even with even in the right direction, even called of God, even called to be a prophet, even called to be a believer, even called to be elect, often we may not be where we ought to be. &gt;&gt; We're not here to play games. We're not here to play church. &gt;&gt; We're here to talk about you, &gt;&gt; talk about our God, &gt;&gt; talk about this message, &gt;&gt; to absorb it and let it permeate us. And are we here? What has he got in mind? Perhaps he would intend to. You think you came from your home? I'm way ahead of myself, but you think you came from your home. That was your place. And you've come here. I come here. Why do we come here? Well, it's Sunday morning. I always come here. This is Sunday. We're believers. We believe in we believe in being together but maybe because of the world and because of situations and because of involvements and whatever more maybe it's put you into another place and and you're consumed and burdened and whatever more and anxious and so on so forth and this God that I'm referring to if I could just increase your faith that you could realize say how can I increase my faith just if you'd realize that this God. &gt;&gt; The God who created the universe. That God. That God that came in the form of Jesus Christ. That God that let that body go to the go to the cross. That God and raised him from the dead. That God is here somehow is in this place. That God is here. That God who knows me infinitely better than I know myself. That God is here. &gt;&gt; That God who maybe I think my need is a certain need, but that God may see the need as being something different. &gt;&gt; Moses was in a shepherd's tent now hering sheep and that was his place. and he saw a bush that wasn't consumed as it burned. He thought, "This is different." And he stepped over and when God saw, he didn't know God was there. Maybe you don't know that God is here. Maybe you think you're in church. I have your attention. And when he stepped to that bush, God said, "Take off your shoes." &gt;&gt; Your place you stand on is holy ground. He didn't know it was holy ground. He didn't know that was a sacred place. It was only holy. It was never referred to again. No one ever went to see the site again that I know of. But the place he was standing on was holy ground. And God saw what he wanted to do. God knew what he wanted to do. God knew what he wanted to do with him. &gt;&gt; He didn't have any idea that he was going to go back to Pharaoh to the palaces with a stick in his hand and say, "Let my people go." &gt;&gt; He had no idea that was going to take place. Never had he stood hearing a voice speak to him that also resounded to a deep calling within him to see his people delivered. The call of a runaway prophet today runaway sons or daughters of God. When I say run away, I don't want you to look on it negatively. But you know, if we live below what we it's not sufficient that we just go on in the format of church services as such when when uh when the God that we speak of the resurrected Jesus Christ, we should be fully aware and fully in expectation every time we walk in these doors. This God who raised up Jesus from the dead is going to be in this place. He's going to be talking to people. He's going to be talking to me. I'm going to have my heart opened and full of expectation as though the prophet of God was here or Jesus Christ himself is here for he is here. &gt;&gt; Whether the minister gets excited about it or doesn't get excited about it, nevertheless, that God is here. and I have certain needs and and perhaps it may not even be what I identify. It might be something else &gt;&gt; and often it is something else. &gt;&gt; I'm going to give you some examples. people thought their dilemma or or people came before the prophet and they were standing there that they they had a great physical need &gt;&gt; and then when the angel of the Lord was there say but your real need is you're not saved &gt;&gt; that's your real need &gt;&gt; you're here because of this but I see someone else standing with you burden for someone else that has cancer These are simply examples of what your God &gt;&gt; did through your prophet &gt;&gt; to show what he is today. And if there's any phrase that was used and repeated, Jesus Christ, the same yesterday, today, this is January what the 18th, 2015. That Jesus Christ that came out of the tomb is here, right beside you, right near you. And he's a God that fills all time and space. He's a God where there's nothing impossible with him. He can turn the world upside down and he can turn your life upside down. Amen. &gt;&gt; Prophet speaks about Moses. He said, "Now he was 80 years old." That blessed me and he knowed more about God in five minutes in the presence of that bush. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Than he learned in 80 years in the schools of Egypt. &gt;&gt; He said, "What Moses lacked the bush had." I say what you lack, &gt;&gt; the bush has. &gt;&gt; That fire has never left. That fire has never been quenched. That fire has never lessened in its intensity. &gt;&gt; For God was in the fire and God by his spirit. And God in Christ said, "I will be in you." &gt;&gt; You've heard it over over again. It's not to make you feel better or to make you feel more elite or have a higher status. It's something that you know and you quietly experience. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; He said and uh and what the seminaries lack tonight, the Holy Ghost has got the same fire of God. What the schools need is fire. Holy Ghost and fire. &gt;&gt; In the presence of that fire. And this is my emphasis to you. In the presence of that fire, &gt;&gt; he had an experience. He was running from Egypt before and now he goes to Egypt. So maybe the thing that we cower from is the thing that God will have us and fill us with something that we face it &gt;&gt; head on. God spoke to Moses and said, "Behold, I send an angel before thee." This was later to keep thee in the way and to bring thee into the place which I have prepared. That was another place that was further on. uh it makes no difference to where you are in your spiritual life. &gt;&gt; It's to take you from this place to another place. &gt;&gt; I'm not just talking about the change of the body. I'm talking about our status &gt;&gt; and our level of life here and our spiritual life here. And there is a place &gt;&gt; by me, he said. And there was a different time when Moses had asked and I perhaps we'll just uh you don't have to turn to it but I'm going to just look at it because that's it's one of my favorite places in Moses experience in his life. Moses had said to the Lord, you'll just listen to me. I don't want you reading. He said to the Lord, "See, thou sayest to me, you said to me, bring up this people, and thou not let me know whom thou wilt send with me. Yet thou hast said, I know thee by name, and thou hast also found grace in my sight." Now therefore, I pray thee, if I found grace in thy sight, show me now thy way, that I may know thee, that I may find grace to thy sight, in thy sight, and consider that this nation is thy people, because God had always put the responsibility on Moses. And he said, "My presence shall go with thee." And the prophet of God said to multitudes and perhaps you sense it this morning said, "You're feeling different now." This maybe not an average Sunday morning service. You're feeling different now. If you are, it's his presence. &gt;&gt; Then he's come to you for a personal reason. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And that's the way our services need to be. said, "I will give thee rest. My presence shall go with thee, and I will give thee rest." And he said unto him, "If thy presence go not with me, carry us not up hither. For wherein shall it be known here that I and thy people have found grace on thy sight? Is it not in that thou goest with us? So shall we be separated, I and thy people." Now he calls them thy people for all the people that are upon the face of the earth. And the Lord said unto Moses, I will do this thing also &gt;&gt; that thou hast spoken, for thou has found grace in my sight, and I know thee by name. &gt;&gt; And I thought, I have a father. &gt;&gt; He knows my name. &gt;&gt; He knows your address. &gt;&gt; He knows where you're sitting this morning. And he said, "I beseech thee." &gt;&gt; Moses said, "I beseech thee, show me thy glory." &gt;&gt; God said, "I will make all my goodness pass before thee, and I will proclaim the name of the Lord before thee, and I will be gracious to whom I will be gracious, and will show mercy on whom I will show mercy. And he said, "Thou canst not see my face, for there shall no man see me and live." And the Lord said, "Behold, there is a place by me." And that's my me message. There is a place by me. And thou shalt stand upon a rock. He says, "And if we," this was in the Africa report service, he said, "And if we'll read the scripture, we find out that it was a pillar of fire that led the children of Israel." The same pillar of fire, I believe, was over Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; And I believe he's risen from the dead. showing the same signs that he showed when he was here on earth. And it is the same pillar of fire &gt;&gt; that's over the church &gt;&gt; right now, the same angel of God &gt;&gt; and that same presence of God. I have to say in a Cloverdale Bible way, either everything he said was false or everything he said is true. And I believe that that is true. And I believe the church ought to say yay and amen. I believe that is true. I believe that same pillar of fire is here in this building. I believe that same angel of the Lord is here. The one that stood between the prophet and his people. The one that stood when he was speaking. Even when he said, "I'm speaking through the pillar of fire." I feel as though I'm speaking through that pillar of fire this morning. Not because I feel it, but because there's a sanctity. There is a seriousness in this atmosphere and God has gripped your attention because he wants this to be nailed down in your heart. This God is present. &gt;&gt; You may be sick. You may be bound. You may not be saved. You may not have had a new birth. That pillar of fire is here to do that. If you can just make contact with him, &gt;&gt; it's extremely important to recognize or to know the place we occupy in the stages of life. A place and a book. And there was delivered unto him unto Jesus the book of the prophet Isaiah. And when he had opened the book, he found he found the place. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Jesus Christ. When he was here, he found the place where it was written, "The spirit of the Lord is upon me because he hath anointed me to preach the gospel to the poor. He hath sent me to heal the brokenhearted, to preach deliverance to the captives, and recovering of sight to the blind, and to set at liberty them that are bruised, to preach the acceptable year of the Lord. And he closed the book. And if you read in Isaiah, it's halfway through the verse. And he closed the book. Halfway through the scripture, he closed the book. And he and and sat down in the eyes of all of them in the synagogue were all fastened on him. And he began to say unto them, "This day is this scripture fulfilled in your ears." That was moving them to another state. Some loved it perhaps. Some hated it. Some didn't want to hear it. Some said, "We've read that scripture thousands of times." But now is a different moment. &gt;&gt; This day is this scripture. And that same Lord Jesus came in this generation in another body, a redeemed body, an adopted son of God that he called a prophet to go through the pages of the book. And we had brother Tom here the other day declaring with all such force and intensity Malachi 4, he found in the book. He found in the book the place where it is read, "Behold, I send you Elijah the prophet and he shall turn the hearts and you can say that is me." And if it has not happened, you say it. My heart has not been turned yet, but this pillar of fire is present to turn my heart. And I have faith. I have faith that he will do so. And when my heart is turned, I will be what he wants me to be. I'll be the witness he wants me to be. I'll be the kind of man, the kind of woman, the kind of young person he wants me to be. I won't be what I am. &gt;&gt; I don't care whether you're a devoted, yielded believer, but who can be something more than you are. Say, "What do you desire, oh God? Let thy will be done on earth. &gt;&gt; I can assure you he is not going to come and say my will is that you'll just come and sit in church this Sunday. No, his will is that your heart will burn with a fire and a fervor where there will be a dedication to God and a yieldedness to him. Say, "Oh God, thy will be done." Even though you may hear things you've heard many times, but the Holy Spirit will punctuate it. &gt;&gt; This day, this day relates to this place. &gt;&gt; The place he found the place in the book And then he said, "This day is this scripture fulfilled." This day, the phrase this day refers to this place in the book. And that now what they were seeing was this day in the book being interpreted. Oh, this is what's happening. Oh, this is the person. We thought he was just Joseph's child. We thought he was just from we his brothers and so on are here. We we thought we knew this man, but now here is the one who spoke the wonderful words on the mount on the sermon on the mount. Now we see who it is. &gt;&gt; Maybe somebody caught it. &gt;&gt; I want to say, oh God, if I was there in the service, if I was in the synagogue, if you were in the synagogue, would you have caught that? &gt;&gt; We're sitting here today to catch something. We're in another day. We're in another hour. &gt;&gt; Brother Charlie Mitchell was a good friend of mine. I didn't know him when he was a minor, but he told me he told me and also brother Fulture, Ernest Fulture, and he was a minor working for the coal mines in Virginia. And taking in that dust, he developed a tumor in his left lung about the size of a man's fist. and his pastor was Ernest Fulture where I was preaching and brother Fulture told him there's a man by the name of William Brandham that prays for the sick and I'll take you to his meeting when he comes and has a meeting. They were having meetings I think in her auditorium in Jeffersonville. It was the 1965 and and the message was this day is this scripture fulfilled and Charlie Mitchell told me that he had never seen the man had never been there had never heard of him and his pastor Ernest Fulture took him and now in the message brother Brandham is just these are the I' I've taken just a few words because I know where it was and I interviewed Charlie Mitchell in Rowan Oak, Virginia at the television station. I don't want to tell relate the story to you, but it was it was gripping. And the prophet said in that service, he says, "But what about the elect group? What about them? If we say, well, we're elect. What about that group?" He said, "What kind of sign are they supposed to say? What are they supposed to have? &gt;&gt; What are we supposed to have? &gt;&gt; He said it. Hallelujah. It shall be light in the evening time. &gt;&gt; If we say we're that group, then that light is shone upon us. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; This day is the scripture fulfilled. &gt;&gt; This day God's promises fulfilled. &gt;&gt; We know that to be the truth. He is here tonight as he was then. And I say to you, in the authority of God's word, on authority of everything he said, he's here this morning as he was then. He's here this morning as he walked out of the out of the up the banks of the Jordan River when the Holy Spirit, this is my beloved son in whom I'm well pleased. And that's it's up to us to say, "Oh God, I believe it is you. What is it that you'd have me to know? What's consuming? What's taking up our life? &gt;&gt; Is it of eternal value? &gt;&gt; He said, "Now to preach it as I am, and I I feel such a heavy responsibility. I'm just on the verge of breaking down to preach it. &gt;&gt; That I said a while ago, if you preach anything and it's the gospel truth, then God is obligated to vindicate that. &gt;&gt; Not back here when he said that today while I'm repeating your word. &gt;&gt; God is here to vindicate that. &gt;&gt; He said, "Is it true and the congregation said amen such as you have now?" Now he said, "If that be so, let the God that wrote the word, let the God that made the prophecy, let the God who is God of the word come forth and prove that he's still God." &gt;&gt; This is burning on my soul, Sister Tracy, wherever you are. &gt;&gt; It's burning on my soul. All of these things, this is what I've been studying and looking to the Lord for about the last few weeks. this place. &gt;&gt; We don't need a place of history. &gt;&gt; We don't need some scripture been fulfilled 2,000 years ago. We need a scripture in the book that's happening now. &gt;&gt; Let the God who wrote the word, let the God who made the prophecy, let the God who is God of the word come forth and prove that he is God. That was Jesus yesterday. He said that was him today. That's him today. You believe that? &gt;&gt; Yes, of course we believe that. He said there is a man sitting right back here. Now, that man has never laid eyes on him before. He's laying eyes on him in a vision. Said, "There's a man sitting right back here. He is suffering. He's got a tumor on his left lung. He doesn't He isn't from here. You have been a mine worker. Oh, do you know why he said you have been a mind worker? He never went back to the mines. Even though he was completely healed, he became a a preacher. He became a pastor of this message for years. And he lived a healthy life till God called him home. I say this God, you ought to say it. This God is my God. [Applause] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. [Music] &gt;&gt; You go ahead and thank him. You go ahead and get what you're supposed to get. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; You have been a mind worker. that is right. I'm a total stranger to you. If that's right, shake your hand. And when I interviewed him, he shook his hand and the tumors in your left lung and you're up for an operation right away. He was to Bristol to Elizabeth till I believe it was on the third city to three cities because the mining company was concerned about their uh the degree of their liability on him. and they sent them from one hospital to another hospital to the third hospital. And when they they said that that tumor has to come out and they wanted to operate right away and he wanted to go to this meeting first. And now here's a man declaring you're up for an operation. Your tumor's in your left lung and you're up for an operation right away. And that is right. And you're not from here. You're from out of town. you're from Virginia and he knows that you're from Langley or he knows you're from Surrey or he knows you're from London or in Lynon or he knows you're from Richmond. He knows exactly your address like some that he he told here and it wasn't him. It was the pillar fire. The pillar fire knows your house number. &gt;&gt; The pillar fire knows what time you walked into this church. &gt;&gt; And that's who you have to believe in. That's who it is. &gt;&gt; You sense you maybe feel something. He said you're not feeling the same. You're feeling different now. Why are you feeling different? It's not just a preaching. It's not just something. It's not just a song that might touch the emotions. It's not just some excitement that might touch your emotion. The God who stood and spoke to Moses, that God still got a voice. That God can address your situation. &gt;&gt; So I have a question. That God has the answer. &gt;&gt; I remember that prophet spoke to a woman. He said, "And you're all troubled." He said, "And the reason you're troubled is there's trouble." She said, "That's right." He said, "There's trouble in your church." And he said, "There's some business things going on and they trouble you." And he said, "And I can tell you they're over." [Music] &gt;&gt; That God, &gt;&gt; why don't you say it? That God &gt;&gt; is my God. Amen. &gt;&gt; Can you say it, young man? &gt;&gt; That God &gt;&gt; is my God. [Music] &gt;&gt; That God knows my problem. &gt;&gt; That God knows my ailment. &gt;&gt; That God knows my dilemma. That God knows my burden. And I leave it to that God to fix it up. &gt;&gt; I give myself to that God. And he went back to Virginia and he went back to the same hospital and they took a picture of his lung and there was no tumor there. That God is my God. When I heard that tumor, there's no blood going through it. Sister Tracy and I started to die in a doctor saying it started to die three weeks ago. That God is my God. &gt;&gt; Not my faith, her faith. &gt;&gt; Not the prophet's faith, your faith. &gt;&gt; God's not here to bless a preacher. He's here to bless his children, his people that he loves. &gt;&gt; Oh, I can hear the heart of God if they only knew how I craved to fellowship with him, to walk with him. He said, "You make a tabernacle as I want to dwell with the people." &gt;&gt; That's a cry of his heart. He wants to dwell with them. &gt;&gt; He doesn't want to spend a couple hours with you on Sunday. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The unic of Ethiopia. I'll just close with brother Fulture. Virginia is the place of his home. Brother Mitchell was brought by brother Ernest, Reverend Ernest Fulture, to that meeting in Jeffersonville, another place. He was transferred from a sick man to a man of perfect health. He was transferred from a mine worker to a pastor. That's my God. Do you believe in that kind of God, friends? &gt;&gt; Is this not a regular service? I don't know what's going to happen. Amen. &gt;&gt; A man of great authority. Unic of Ethiopia, great authority and status over all the treasure of Candace the Queen. Candace was not her name as such. If you read the history, Ethiopia was a very large and powerful kingdom. And Candice, the real name is Kandake also. Candice or Kanddeck was the name that was the name of all queens or queen mothers in Ethiopia and there they were mighty warriors some of them and Candice this one here was a mighty warrior. It is said that Alexander the Great in his invasions and taking country after country after country when she heard he was coming, she set her throne on two elephants and came to the edge of the river where they would cross and had her armies all lined up. And when they said when Alex, this is one of the theories when Alexander the Great saw that he was afraid that he might be defeated and he especially didn't want to be defeated by a woman and he backed away. And she's the only one that overcame Alexander the Great. She was a very very prominent and powerful and her kingdom was enormous. It took in all of Egypt and further south. This man was a man of such stature. He didn't have to have a convoy of armed men for security. And Philillip, he didn't question Philillip, where did you come from out in this desert? Everything was everything was just timed. His hunger was ready to receive him and he was reading in the scripture in the place the place he was wounded for our transgressions. He's bruised for our iniquities. He's led as a lamb to the slaughter and as a sheep before her shears is dumb. So he opened not his mouth. Philip said, "Do you know where you're reading? I read hundreds of times, perhaps that's an exaggeration, I read many times, I'll say Revelation 10 and one. &gt;&gt; And I saw another mighty angel. &gt;&gt; Who's he speaking of? I didn't know. &gt;&gt; Who's he speaking of? Is he speaking of some angel from heaven or is he speaking of who's he speaking of? I don't know. Did you know? Thank God that same Lord Jesus came in the form of a man and opened up the book to us and told us who that was and now I can say oh Lord Jesus it was you [Music] &gt;&gt; and a unic is saying how can I tell unless somebody tells me I don't know who is he speaking of himself the prophet Isaiah or is he speaking of someone else. And starting at that scripture, he preached to him, Jesus. And I say, starting at that scripture, this prophet of God preached to me, Jesus. Resurrected. Hallelujah. This Jesus descending. This Jesus with an open book in his hand. This Jesus interpreting the word. The same Jesus that wrote the word is here interpreting the word. Hallelujah. Let the people of God give him glory. And Philip opened his mouth as many of you have and began at the same scripture and preached unto him Jesus. The unic had the scriptures. The world has a Bible. The churches had the Bible. You had the Bible. &gt;&gt; And when anyone else says today, well, I see in the message, well, I don't know if it means that. What did it mean before he came? &gt;&gt; What it mean before the message? What did what was your understanding before? Then go back to that understanding and be in total confusion. He did not know that. He did not know. And we can say we did not know that scripture referred to our day. &gt;&gt; He did not know that scripture referred to his day. He did not know that it had been fulfilled. &gt;&gt; Neither did we. &gt;&gt; And he did not know that it included him. &gt;&gt; Thank God we found out it included us. [Music] &gt;&gt; Not to put us in another building and another place, but to put us in a place where he could talk to us, where he could reveal himself to us. And the revelation is a continuing revelation. If you haven't experienced it yet, today is the day. &gt;&gt; I know brother Tom, brother John is going to preach this evening, but I'm going to finish. I have to finish. &gt;&gt; The Bible or you hold includes you. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The Bible you hold which is Christ knows your real need. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And this I felt that I must say this is the right place. &gt;&gt; You don't belong in any other place. You belong here so you can meet him &gt;&gt; at this morning meeting I'm talking about. I don't care where you go to church or anything else. Not talking about that. But I'm not talking about Cloverdale, by the way. That's not the place. But you're in a place of worship. You're in a place of sanctuary. You're in a place that supports and believes the word that God has sent and has found it in the book. This is the place. [Applause] &gt;&gt; Don't stay in your problem. &gt;&gt; Don't stay in your dilemma. &gt;&gt; Don't stay where you haven't got an answer. &gt;&gt; This is the place. Amen. &gt;&gt; And as you believe it, you'll go on and look back and you'll say, "That was the morning. That was the place. And that was the service." &gt;&gt; You must come to the place where you say, "This is me." &gt;&gt; That's why the prophet of God asked the people when he was telling them and and revealing their situation, he said, "Is that right?" and they would say that is right. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; I'm not a prophet or a son of a prophet. But on the other hand, we are not merely quoting from a prophet. We're serving the God of Elijah, the God of William Brandham, the God and father of our Lord Jesus Christ. He's the one and he's the one who could only say, "I will be in you. I will be with you and in you." I say this is a place I say Lord Jesus, you pillar of fire, &gt;&gt; you that spoke to Moses, you that spoke to Paul, Apostle Paul, you're the one that's here speaking to me and speaking through me. If I didn't believe that, I'd close my Bible and walk away from this pulpit. Amen. &gt;&gt; This is the right place. Make known his desire. &gt;&gt; What is your desire, Father? The unic read, he was led as a sheep to the slaughter and like a sheep and like a lamb before his shears. Is so he opened not his mouth. I read and we read and I saw another mighty angel come down from heaven clothed with a cloud and a rainbow was upon his head. His covenant was over his head and his face was as it were the sun and his feet as pillars of fire. We didn't know but I say to you today now we know. And the unic could say, "Here's water. What does hinder me?" &gt;&gt; And I saw the word open up from Genesis to Revelation. I said, "This is a message. What does hinder me?" What hinder you? Nothing hinders you. This flesh will try to stand in the way. This flesh will try to press you down. But this is the word for you. &gt;&gt; This is the message and this is the place. And you're in the right place. [Applause] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. understand God and his headship. &gt;&gt; We began to understand the Melzdc priesthood. &gt;&gt; We began to understand something about the Theophony body. Why don't you want to know where you're going? &gt;&gt; We began to understand what makes us strong and what makes us weak. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; We began to understand the voice of the resurrected Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And if one thing ever stood out to me, and I've said it hundreds of times, this to me, this is the rapture call. &gt;&gt; And I believe I said those words to you, Brother Tim, on our first meeting. You told us of a dream when you were in your youth, a child, and it concerned you. And I never did say, but I had this similar dream when I was a boy. And I saw mother and father. And I I had to I had to stand up. But God was telling me in my youth, I wasn't even 12 years old. I wasn't even 10. I was about seven years old and there were some spots on the garment and I saw those spots. I knew they had to get off so that I could be in this rapture. That touched me. When you told me yours, that touched me. &gt;&gt; And here he is now. Been ministering alongside, been a pastor for 28 years. I think did it change his place? Yes, it changes place. This is the rapture call. I say it and you should say it also. I have been called. I'm here because of the rapture call. Not here because I was born into it. I'm not here because someone convinced me into it. I'm here because I heard the voice of the Lord Jesus Christ. I hear the voice of the angel as he's coming down &gt;&gt; doing all three. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; The shout, &gt;&gt; the voice, and the resurrection, and the trumpet call. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Oh, friends, I must feel I'm beside myself. &gt;&gt; Forgive me. I'm expecting an explosion &gt;&gt; of of happenings, &gt;&gt; of God doing things. I'm preaching that your faith may be increased. &gt;&gt; I'm preaching that you might meet him, &gt;&gt; this pillar of fire, &gt;&gt; and receive what you need. &gt;&gt; Young men, young ladies, &gt;&gt; families, children, single ones, this is your God. &gt;&gt; Hear ye him. [Music] He said we must find in God's only provided place. God's only provided place. &gt;&gt; We must find where he did put his name. For it is his only provided place. There's not a dozen places, friends. There's only one provided place where God put his name. He said, "And he will only receive worship in that place." And his name is manifested in what he does. &gt;&gt; When he says, "You got a tumor in your left lung," the name of God is being manifested. &gt;&gt; Interpreted that that's him speaking. &gt;&gt; Why can't we see that? That's not for you to turn over in your mind. Forget turning it over in your mind. Just accept and acknowledge it. That's God speaking. &gt;&gt; The son always takes the father's name &gt;&gt; in every case. I came into the earth, he said, with the name of a brom because my father's name was Branom. Jesus said, I come in my father's name and you receive me not. He said, "You want the scripture for that?" Yes. John 5:43. I came in my father's name. &gt;&gt; And he said, "The name of the father is Jesus." &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And he's the way. He's the door. He's the house. &gt;&gt; I will say he's the place. &gt;&gt; I thought of calling this message a place called Jesus Christ. Amen. &gt;&gt; That's the place. There is no other place &gt;&gt; where to go to church. I go to church in a place called Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; He's my place. &gt;&gt; He's the secret dwelling place of almighty God. &gt;&gt; And the name here he explains it. I want you to hear it. I would have put this on the screen, but I didn't have time. And the name, the name is the word because he is the word. Amen. And what is it? What is he then? The word interpreted &gt;&gt; is the manifestation of the name. The word interpreted when the word and and the word can only be truth. In him was truth. So when a prophet of God speaks and that's why he said hundreds and thousands of times is that the truth and they would say yes that's the interpretation of the manifestation of the name that is the name of Jesus Christ on whom we believe &gt;&gt; you Jesus [Applause] &gt;&gt; I was I was hoping you'd be there brother Ellie I need you this Morning. &gt;&gt; Give him glory. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; The word interpreted is a manifestation of the name of God. &gt;&gt; No wonder flesh and blood hath not revealed this to you. But my father which is in heaven has revealed this to you. Who am I? And upon this rock I'll build my my my place of worship. &gt;&gt; On this rock I'll build my place of worship. That is why he said there is a place by me &gt;&gt; and thou shalt be upon a rock. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. my place of worship and the gates of hell shall can't shake it down. &gt;&gt; I don't care what your situation is. You want to look that devil in the eyeball and put the blame where it belongs. Say, "You can't shake me. You'll never shake this message out of me." And the sh and the more he shakes, the more it takes root down deeper. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; I say glory be to God. [Music] &gt;&gt; Every once in a while people re talk about, well, you went through a lot of trouble some time ago. That doesn't I I thank God for it. &gt;&gt; It makes your roots go deeper. &gt;&gt; Nothing can happen to the saints of God unless God allows it. And he allows it for their benefit. [Music] [Applause] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Are you in the right place? Amen. &gt;&gt; Brother Aaron, I spoke to you before the service and that's why I spoke to you. This is the place. &gt;&gt; It's over. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; The pillar fire with the answer. &gt;&gt; Your answer. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; We need to receive it in the name of Jesus Christ. [Music] Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Yet a little while in the world seeth me no more. &gt;&gt; But you see me &gt;&gt; because I live. You shall live also. &gt;&gt; And at that day, you shall know. &gt;&gt; You shall know. You will not guess. You will not have to feel it. You shall know I'm in the father and you in me and I in you. Who is it then at this pulpit today? Jesus Christ in a vessel. Who is it in your seat? It's Jesus Christ in a vessel. And then you can believe what he sent is for me. &gt;&gt; Do you believe that? &gt;&gt; You believe that on the balconies? You believe that over here? This is a place. [Music] [Applause] If you abide in me and my words abide in you, &gt;&gt; you shall ask what you will &gt;&gt; and it shall be done &gt;&gt; unto you. Amen. Hallelujah. Come sir. What a messenger said with the same pillar of fire that is here &gt;&gt; happened to be there that day. Do you believe with all your heart? &gt;&gt; That's number one. &gt;&gt; Do you believe with all your heart? &gt;&gt; Do you believe that you're standing in his presence? &gt;&gt; Amen. That man didn't know he was standing in his presence. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah &gt;&gt; any more than Moses knew he was standing on holy ground. &gt;&gt; There are some here that don't realize where you're sitting. &gt;&gt; You are now in his presence. &gt;&gt; Not you will be. You are now. &gt;&gt; And there are many people that were in his presence that missed what they could have had. He was there on their behalf. &gt;&gt; He was there to bless them. &gt;&gt; He's your answer. &gt;&gt; He knows your problem. &gt;&gt; He knows your question. He knows the dilemma. &gt;&gt; And he has the answer. &gt;&gt; And he says, "You're in his presence. If I be God's prophet, &gt;&gt; then he will reveal to me what's wrong with you. &gt;&gt; I am not him. As he said, I am not him. Speaking of Jesus, or I would not put myself in the place of Apostle Paul. We are not William Brham, but we are believers of the God of him and the God that sent him and the God that spoke and said you will take a message and as and your message will forrun the second coming of Jesus Christ and I can say that message has caught us. The Lord Jesus has caught us &gt;&gt; and brought us to this place &gt;&gt; to take us to another place. [Applause] He said, "He will reveal to me what's wrong with you." That's right. You believe that? He said, "You have some kind of spells. It's epilepsy." Oh, if we thought about epilepsy and we think, "Oh, all the things he said about epilepsy and what a powerful demon it was." But he goes, he leaves that right at that point. And he says, "And another thing, the greatest you need of all is Jesus Christ as your savior." He went up there and said, "I've got epilepsy coming on me. I'm going to go before this man. I come from my home, from my place, and I've come to another place, an auditorium. I happen to get a card." Maybe he did or he didn't. And now he's standing on the platform. What a place. &gt;&gt; But your real need is, &gt;&gt; as they said to Moses, take off your shoes. &gt;&gt; You're standing on holy ground. the the the feet that walked on the beautiful carpets of Egypt and in the marble palaces. He never had never dreamed that day he got up. It was just another day with the sheep and just another day at the office. Just another day at my work grinding it all out. It's just another day. It's not just another day. Father Mike Giani, not just another day cutting meat in a shop. You're son of God with a message from the Lord with Jesus Christ dwelling in you. Let the world do what they want to do. Let the world say what they want to say. They can't beat it out of you. They can't burn it out of you. There isn't enough doubting devils in the world to get it out of you. Do you believe that? &gt;&gt; How about you in the balconies? Do you believe that? &gt;&gt; Let me see your hands. &gt;&gt; God bless you. &gt;&gt; God bless you. Let me see the hands down here. We believe that. You believe that? You believe that? &gt;&gt; When you are a believer, you're you're you're a receptacle for all of these things. You're in a place. You're in the right place. &gt;&gt; Your need, the greatest need of all is Jesus Christ as your savior. Is that right? You accept him now as your personal savior. Stop smoking and everything else and you're going to give your life to Christ. Quit smoking. Throw them out of your pocket then. Hallelujah. If you're done, you're done. &gt;&gt; I'm finished with this stuff. I'm done with it. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. [Music] [Applause] I assure you that this man came to a place and heard a preacher, a place concerned about epilepsy, a place or a state of condition. didn't dream or imagine that he would find himself in the most honored place in the universe. I got to get down here. Something's been really affecting me. I love seeing the glories of the universe. And when I do and I hear the vast distances from stars and other planets and I see these great bursts from the sun going hundreds of millions of years, light years out and affecting things on Earth. I I'm challenged. My human mind is challenged. I can only go back to what a prophet said. &gt;&gt; He fills all time and space. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; He fills all the space between you and me. &gt;&gt; He fills all the space of the universe. I I can't explain that. And yet he says he's a being and he lives in a house called heaven. He's a being. He has feelings. He's grieved. &gt;&gt; When at times he wants to rejoice and hear worship of his people. He's a being. &gt;&gt; He has feelings. &gt;&gt; This God I don't have any words. English language is kaput. It's impossible. But when the one that came down that pillar of fire when he I want to make it and he comes down into a man behind the pulpit by the name of William Brandham and has all the same attributes and that the the attribute of humility there there's a record of a woman that's standing washing dishes a preacher's wife a great known preacher and she's washing dishes and sees a little old car uh stop in front of their place and out gets a small man which was brother Brandon in much younger days. And she said she doesn't know why, but she just broke down, began to weep because it just his his his presence emanated such humility and it just broke her down. I know what that's about. &gt;&gt; That God will stand there and use his mouth &gt;&gt; to the place where he say, "I don't remember what I said. I don't know what I said. I have to play the tape back. and say to a man, say to a woman, and many times friends, could have been you, could have been you. In fact, is this morning it is you. &gt;&gt; And he said, you're standing &gt;&gt; you're standing &gt;&gt; on holy ground. &gt;&gt; You are now standing in his presence. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Now what's the problem? &gt;&gt; Now where do we live? &gt;&gt; Now what is it that we need? &gt;&gt; I need this. I need that. I need something else. Those things are so infatile. They're so uh they're unimportant. They're unrelated to where we are this morning. Here you are, friends, and may never have this opportunity again quite late. And a man is standing there. a man with epilepsy trying to come back with a cigarette in a pocket of of cigarettes in his pocket binding him and holding him. And to hear the words, you're standing in his presence now. There's no place in the universe like that. There's no place there's no place on earth. &gt;&gt; Even the cities of the world just disintegrate. Hollywood doesn't exist. It's a disgusting, filthy place as it is. The earth is going to be destroyed by this holy God. &gt;&gt; And when the world's on fire, friends, listen to this little preacher. &gt;&gt; You want to be hidden in God's bosom &gt;&gt; as a believer then as you are now. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; I'm saying this for a purpose. Yeah. &gt;&gt; In one of his last messages, he trying to tell people and never resisting it, but he plowed ahead. I'm glad he plowed ahead for you and for me. &gt;&gt; You grew up from your birth. Everybody here has been born. &gt;&gt; And you, he's talking to you. You grew up from your birth. When you was born and presented into this world and God knew. I have highlighted God knew that you were going to be here in this earth and you grew up from birth to maturity. Things that seem strange, so strange to you in your young womanhood, young boyhood or children as children now seem very real. You couldn't understand it when you was a child, but now you have become adult and you begin to understand and find out that everything was just right &gt;&gt; and you really it really means something to you now. &gt;&gt; Oh friends, &gt;&gt; I don't want because I know how he lived and I know how our Lord Jesus lived. I hesitate to talk about how I lived, but I shunted all over the place. Moved many times, 13 times from the time I was eight. I counted one time 17. That's irrelevant. Absolutely irrelevant. And I didn't understand it then. And I just became passive. I became a very passive child. So, you're going to live here and you go to school here and now this is what is a log school. Now you're in this place and now you're in town and now you're in this army camp and you're sleeping here and it's bitterly cold so you have to slide your bed around the old oil heater to stay warm and on and on and on. None of you young people have experienced what this man here has experienced. I can say that. You don't hear me talking about it when you were young. Maybe you go through things with your parents and you don't understand and why is this in my school and my teachers and so on so forth. God knows exactly what he's doing and why he's doing it. And when you become adult and mature in the same way spiritually, spiritually you wonder why is this and why is that and why are these things and now since I come to the message this is happening and that's happening. That's just a normal run of things. That's the way it's supposed to happen. But when you grow up in the message, when you grow up and become a mature Christian, you'll turn around, look back, and say, "Oh, that is why." Then you'll say, "Thank God. Thank God for the trial. Thank God for the hardship. Thank God when things fell apart. Thank God when I was broke. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. [Applause] [Music] And he said, "So it is in your spiritual birth." &gt;&gt; He said, "You do things that you don't understand &gt;&gt; when you're a little baby come to the altar and you give your life." And I'm not speaking for brother Jonathan now. I'm just reading. And he You give your life to Christ. He has. And I'm so glad. and you do such strange things and I'm so glad maybe not everyone's running to the altar. Thank God he is here. Something motivated him to come to the altar and I say may that pillar of fire bring to him all that he has need of. I can tell you one thing if we would all surrender if you'd surrender you that have just stood and you know I I'm not I'm just not emotional. I don't care about your emotion. You don't have to have an emotion as such, but you need to allow him to come in and allow him to mold and to agree that it is him. Acknowledge him. &gt;&gt; Lord Jesus, thy will be done. &gt;&gt; Do with me as you say fit. &gt;&gt; Here I am. Whether it's to be elevated or to be abased, &gt;&gt; here I am. &gt;&gt; Whether it's to have friends or have them leave, here I am. [Music] &gt;&gt; Whether it's to make a decision for a change, you must say yes, Lord. &gt;&gt; Yes, Lord. I'll say yes to you. &gt;&gt; There's no other way. Dust thou believe? &gt;&gt; Said, "It seems so strange &gt;&gt; when you staggered into that little chapel or that little place &gt;&gt; and ran right down and fell down at the altar. It seems so strange. But now you understand it. &gt;&gt; It seems so strange when some of you came to an old Bible way house. &gt;&gt; Brother Gil Ashdown, Sister Karen. Seems so strange. Brother Kyle, when you are going to Victoria and those people, those sheep are precious to the Lord. They're his gems. You're looking after the gems of his clown. and to see Sister Christina playing the organ and helping them to have worship. I say the pillar of fire is present and he's either pleased or displeased. And I say to you, he is pleased with every effort. He sees the resources and the funds that are spent. And we pray for brother Don, not ashamed. If I were in need, I would want you to pray for me. I believe in the prayers of God's people. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And you staggered into a line. You just fell at the altar. He said, "God knew that. God knew that &gt;&gt; before the world was. &gt;&gt; God knew that before the foundation of the world. It seems strange to you then. &gt;&gt; You just stumbled into a place &gt;&gt; and he says of his of the tabernacle and I can say that of this place because of what our desire is to get this message. We have no personal ambition. We have no human kingdom to build. We have absolutely no interest in that. None of these men have any interest in that. I can assure you I it's repulsive to me to think somebody build up a name on this message. Why? What a disgrace. &gt;&gt; We are here for one purpose to propagate. &gt;&gt; Give the winds a mighty voice. Be it internet, be it disc, be it book, be it whatever it is. That's what we're here for. &gt;&gt; To our last breath. We will declare that &gt;&gt; God has sent a voice. &gt;&gt; The voice of our beloved. &gt;&gt; This is just to help you. There came a time in Jesus life. Can I have a few more minutes? &gt;&gt; There came time in Jesus life. He's going to have the last Passover. Listen, friends, he has needs, too. God needs feet. &gt;&gt; God needs somebody with a mouth. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; God needs a body. &gt;&gt; God needs your body. &gt;&gt; And he won't substitute it with another one. &gt;&gt; He needs you. Amen. &gt;&gt; Every person in this place needs to say, "What would you have me to do? &gt;&gt; What will you have me to do?" &gt;&gt; And Jesus said, "You'll go and prepare me supper." And I want to know where. They said, "You go down the road and you'll see a man carrying a picture and he will show you a large upper room, furnished, and prepared." Doesn't sound exactly like the messenger. Why? You came here and you have this and you have that, but your real need is this and you're praying for somebody else. and he'll show you a large upper room furnished and prepared and there make ready for us. &gt;&gt; You'll find this place. I have just a little section here and I felt very very moved when I came to this part and brother Nathan perhaps later will sing he knows my name he knows my every thought now I said just a moment I heard a name talking to a lady. It's your husband. His first name is Lewis or something. Somebody said Lewis. Is that right? And I see your house number. It's 631 45th Street and it's right here in Palm Beach. That's not a clairvoyant, friends. &gt;&gt; That's not a preacher. &gt;&gt; Amen. says, "Somebody's over here has got pain in their knee. That has nothing to do with that. That stuff has gone out the door. I have nothing to do with that anymore. Your name is this &gt;&gt; and is that right? And you live at this address. You live in Lynden or you live in Langley and he knows your house number. He knows you came to church. You left that place and you're sitting in this place." And he knew what I would be speaking. And he knew how the voice would be calling out to you. And he knows that you're here with a certain question. You're here with a certain dilemma. You're here with some problem. He's the solver of the problem. He's the worker of supernatural things. &gt;&gt; How old you have to be? I'm looking at a girl here. You're probably no older than Sister Biscll was when she sat in church. And to this day, there are times when I feel I can hardly make church, but I know she wants to be in church. And so I drive her to church. Sometime I sit in my office cuz my wife wants to be in church. She wants to hear the word. You don't see her up doing glorious things, but she receives the word in her soul. &gt;&gt; You came to church. He knows your address. He knows exactly where you come from. He knows what motivated you. He knows who invited you. He knows your situation. &gt;&gt; Some of you grew up in a Christian home in a believer's home and God saw that and knew that. I remember sitting on the front seat in our house. Mother and dad just got saved from Catholicism. and I'd get up and go into the kitchen and comb my hair and come back. But here I am and I never forgot those days. &gt;&gt; I remember when I was 14. Who's 14? Anybody 14? Nobody 14? God bless you. It's tough time. There's girls here 14. and they don't want to let everybody know when they're 14. That's okay. I was 14, nailed out the kitchen chair and a man put his hand on my back and began to weep, said, "Oh, God, make Eddie a preacher." That's all he said. And here we are doing our best. &gt;&gt; Does God have a voice? &gt;&gt; He has a voice. &gt;&gt; Does he know where you are today? &gt;&gt; I saw Sister Leslie coming in with her two children this morning. And I said to my wife, "God bless her." Amen. &gt;&gt; And those children, those children coming into the house of God &gt;&gt; and I knew what I was going to be speaking. &gt;&gt; God knew that you were here. He knows the address you came from in Richmond coming here to this service. And let can I finish this this please? &gt;&gt; And look, this is the kind of God I'm serving. And look, your house number is 11454 on McKinley Street and your name is CD. Do it. Your name is Eva and your last name is York. &gt;&gt; And you live in this city and your house number 6136 Street. Is that right? You're going home to Well, &gt;&gt; hallelujah. Amen. &gt;&gt; This is the kind of pillar of fire I want. &gt;&gt; This is the kind of Holy Ghost that &gt;&gt; come to live in you. &gt;&gt; And if you have not had the Holy Spirit or the baptism of the Holy Ghost or birthed by the Holy Spirit, &gt;&gt; put everything else in this life &gt;&gt; aside. &gt;&gt; That is number one. &gt;&gt; You're not from here. You're not from this locality. &gt;&gt; No, you're from another place called El Monte, California. Something on that order. And that's right. And your name is Naomi. That's right. Moore is your last name. And your house number is 502. Something like Mullhill Street. That's right. Is that right? Now listen friends. There was multitudes of people sitting in those services like you're sitting in those services. He did not call their house number. He called their house number to let you know he knows your house number. &gt;&gt; And he said, "I'm doing this that it might help your faith." &gt;&gt; Let your faith be released. &gt;&gt; Put yourself in that person's place. That God is my God. &gt;&gt; That God who knows every detail, that's my God. Maybe some of us need to say, "Speak on, Lord. &gt;&gt; Speak on." &gt;&gt; What more would you say? &gt;&gt; And I close with this. Said, "The Holy Spirit tells me." That's what he was saying. The Holy Spirit tells me, "He tells me you're not from this country. He tells me you're from Tennessee. Your name is Turner. James Turner. It's James Turner. Your house you live on, it's Third and North Street. Your house number is 223, isn't it? You're healed. Go back home. &gt;&gt; I say that God is my God. I'm not reading a quote. That God still speaks. Lots of other people never had their house numbers. He knows your house number. He was only doing that as evidence that the who God was and who the man was. [Applause] Who's got a dire need and a question stand believers lay hands upon one another in the name of Jesus Christ for we are going to pray and do what the Holy Spirit has told us to to Almighty God. And I want all the people to pray in unison. You begin to pray. Pray as God would hear you. Pray words that you believe are acceptable to him. Father, as your people and as I have sought to obey you, I obey you now, oh God, for the very purpose that the presence of the pillar of fire in whose presence we are. We're in the presence of the resurrected Christ. You know every case. You know every condition. You know every sickness. You know every disease. We declare in the name of Jesus Christ. Satan's chains are broken. The dilemma is solved. Oh God. We will await your answer in the name of Jesus Christ. Sicknesses must leave. We rebuke the demons of hell. Must leave this place. Must leave this place. This place of faith. This place of the answer. This dwelling place of almighty God. Oh God, you know my name. You know my address. You know the place I live. I give myself to you. Oh God, we give ourselves to you. This congregation of people give themselves to you. Oh, I pray you'll bless those on the internet in the name of Jesus Christ. Reach out.
