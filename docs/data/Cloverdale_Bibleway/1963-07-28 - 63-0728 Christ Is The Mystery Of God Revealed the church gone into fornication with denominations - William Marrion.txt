Description:
Video clip with End Time Message through God's vindicated prophet of Malachi 4:5-6, William Marrion Branham, from 1909 to 1965. It's all about Jesus Christ revealing Himself just before the end time. See Luke 17:30 and Rev 10:7

AMOS 3:7
  7    Surely the Lord GOD will do nothing, but he revealeth his secret unto his servants the prophets.

REVELATION 10:7
  7    But in the days of the voice of the seventh angel, when he shall begin to sound, the mystery of God should be finished, as he hath declared to his servants the prophets.
TRANSCRIPT
========================================
your free moral AG so therefore if he put the first like that he has to put the second like that he has to put everyone like that or he acted wrong in the first place but everybody is on that same basis now noticing and bringing that back and let that man do that and knowing that he would do it nobody would do it but what did it do it displayed his attribute as Savior and the whole purpose then is left in Jesus Christ to be become God himself to take the penalty of his own law death to die to redeem the wife that was lost by rejecting him when Eve went away from the word she went away from her mate and when the church goes away from the word to a denomination she rejects and commits fornications with the world of man's Wisdom rejecting the authority of God's word that sound clear the Bible said committing spiritual fornications any word in the Bible That's rejected or any self-interpretation put to it it's absolutely rejecting and committing adultery against the god that is your husband an adulterous never enters the kingdom of heaven we know that now see that's what Eve done at the first place
