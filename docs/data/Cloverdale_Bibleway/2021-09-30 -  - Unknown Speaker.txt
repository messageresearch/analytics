that we may able to receive something from you tonight father i pray oh god that you take your word tonight that you breathe life into the scriptures oh god that you'll may become substance in the hearts of your people that have gathered tonight with knees in our hearts lord i don't know their needs you know their needs father even better than they do oh god so i pray that you take the man aside lord god that you're able to speak life that we can have an encounter with you tonight for we pray in the name of the lord jesus christ amen thank you musicians good evening god bless you well last time we were here and we we pray that it will be a one-time thing let's pray tonight it'll be just a two-time thing i am very conscious that i have nothing to offer tonight but to as brother tom was telling me the back to make way for god himself to set myself aside that god may be able to speak tonight and that's my desire and i believe we come to church because we have needs right and uh it will be it will be a shame really to to go back home with the same needs uh and and not have the the opportunity to express them to the lord and have god speak back to us so you know your needs i i don't know your needs nobody here behind me knows your need but i i guarantee you if you come pulling and needing something of the lord and believing you'll receive it then certainly god will receive it uh god will give it to you and you'll receive it i'm not going to be bound by my notes i'm just going to relax and let the holy spirit really have his way so you really are able to have whatever you want tonight let's open our bible and in the book of isaiah chapter 55 we're going to read verse 6 and verse 7. seek ye the lord while he may be found call ye upon him while he is near let the wicked forsake his way and the unrighteous man his thoughts and let him return unto the lord and he will have mercy upon him and to our god for he will abundantly pardon let's turn also to ephesians chapter 5 verse 15. ephesians chapter 5 verse 15 to 16. see then that ye walk circumspectly not as fools but as wise redeeming the time because the days are evil another translation says therefore see that you walk carefully living life with honor purpose and courage shining those who tolerate evil not as the unwise but as wise sensible discerning people making the very most of your time on earth recognizing and taking advantage of each opportunity and using it with wisdom and diligence because the days are evil let's have a little prayer heavenly father the scriptures are indeed inspired but the lord has told us that the letter killed by the spirit gives life so i pray father for the spirit of god whose presence we're in and we fail to unknown the words oh god that they can become life in the hearts of the people we once again commit ourselves into your hands the hearers and the speaker in the name of the lord jesus christ that you may be glorified in jesus name we pray amen you may have your seats redeem the time redeeming the time as we read another translation speaks about recognizing an opportunity and making use of every single opportunity we get our time on earth is made of moments even soccer games basketball games it's made of moments and usually when the game is over you remember the key moments of the game also known the highlights of the game and you remember them whether they were entertaining whether it was a goal scoring opportunity whether it was controversial call by the referee but you remember a game by those moments and our lives are defined by those moments we're remembered at the end of our lives by those moments and when we talk about something that's passed on you you recall specific moments with that person and the impression that we leave on people those are moments that they'll remember so when the bible records cain's life nothing much is recorded about his life because there is really nothing worth recording beside that moment and the moment where he killed his brother or the moment where he rejected the mercy of god so at the end of king's life his condemnation will not necessarily be about did he work did he work hard enough on his garden or on the condition of his fruits but what would condemn me what those moments the moments that he had and what he made of it the time and opportunity was given and what he did with that opportunity so in the service like tonight the word of god will come forth and each person here tonight will have a moment and we are all going to be given those moments in this in the service tonight and those are defining moments those moments are also called opportunities and tonight by the grace of god like to speak on the hour of opportunity and for a subject like to speak on the value of an opportunity an opportunity by definition is a set of circumstances that makes it possible to do something it's an occasion or a situation that makes it possible to accomplish something that you wanted to do or something that you must do another definition which which is very remarkable to me is it's a favorable juncture of circumstances and the juncture speaks about a point in time so there comes a point or a moment in time where circumstances are combined in a favorable way that gives you an opportunity and an opportunity really depends on those circumstances those circumstances on their own are irrelevant but when they combine at a specific juncture it gives room for an opportunity an opportunity is also a favorable appropriate or advantageous combination of circumstances it's a time that's convenient and fit or situation that's fit or placed as fit permitting to do something and when you talk about the value of an opportunity we're speaking about the importance or the worth or the usefulness that we that we assign or that we put on that opportunity how we value it there was a shoe salesman uh there was a shoe company who said who sent a salesman a long time ago in some part of africa and he was there for two weeks and he wrote back to his company a letter saying please bring me home nobody wears shoes here then they sent another salesman in his place and in a couple of weeks he sent a letter back to the company saying please send all the shoes you can nobody wears shoes here so it's the same circumstances but one had the eye to identify an opportunity and assign a value to it he didn't just say send 10 shoes he said send all the shoes you can possibly send for his put a certain value to that opportunity even though the circumstances were the same for both salesmen one was able to identify an opportunity and take it so the circumstances were the same but one is able to identify the opportunity and see that value and circumstances play an important role but it's when they're combined in the favorable way in other words there was a market where there was a need there was no shoes there was a company there was a salesman and there was stock and inventory now when you combine all those elements together and all those circumstances together at a specific juncture of time there's an opportunity that arises so to really understand opportunities you have to understand the circumstances uh for brothers you can start the slide show the first slide please there's been multiple opportunities missed in in the world you have the first one yeah there you go can everybody see that no okay we're good uh who knows about excite who's ever heard a company called excite who knows google right so when google was founded larry page and sergey brin the founders of google after laboring in the first couple of years they decided to sell google they went to a company called excite who also had a search engine and had a web portal and they offered to sell google for a million dollars the negotiated little only reduced the asking price to 750 000 dollars the ceo of uh exciting was george i'm forgetting his last name i think george bell there it is and uh he said no there is an opportunity to acquire google for 750 000 and here a man who's a ceo interested to make decisions interesting to recognize opportunities of investment he didn't catch this opportunity and said no today google is worth 367 billion dollars and who knows excite nobody next slide alexander graham bell was he had offered the patent to western union for a hundred thousand dollars about for the telephone today it's it's about 2.4 million dollars in today's money western union described the device as idiotic nobody will ever use that today there's more telephones on the earth than people another opportunity that was missed next slide roland wing and again if i may ask you who knows ronald wayne who knows steve jobs right we don't remember ronald wayne but he was one of the three founders of apple and in fact he had the one he was the one with the most money as all the three founders and he was the one who created the apple logo that you see the first logan was the one who created it he owned 10 of apple but he feared because he was wondering the most money if the company wanted debt the responsibility would be upon him so he decided to sell all his shares the 10 stick for 800 in today's money is 3500 apple is worth 2 trillion dollars today his 10 share will be 200 billion dollars today this man is still alive kicking himself every single day his children when they read this dad why are you like this why couldn't you seize that opportunity so you see that throughout history and in business in in many circumstances there are opportunities we don't remember those who miss them remember those who take them and taking an opportunity really is the best thing you can do because once you miss it you can look back and regret today ronald wayne is still alive and he's not known at all he's 800 dollars that he got i don't know why they bought with that but today will be worth 200 billion dollars so if you could turn back the clock you can take off the slice if you could turn back the clock and give this same man the same opportunity i guarantee you they will take it if ronald wayne today had the opportunity to go back in time and make a decision on whether to keep his 10 stick of apple or not i guarantee you he will keep his 10 stake because today he knows the value of the opportunity that he missed but he cannot go back in time and make a different decision but as for us it's easier now when we're looking today to see why didn't this man make the right decision well to be honest and to be fair it wasn't quite easy to discern because google for example was in the early stage of the company there was some risk involved apple the guy ronald wayne was in debt in the past so he had some concerns about if this doesn't work i'm going to be in debt again so there are some valid risks that perhaps they consider more than the opportunity itself so when you make an opportunity in the business world like them there are risks because they do not know how the opportunity will pan out so it's easier to determine or to decide whether or not to take an opportunity if you know how things will play out so the easiest opportunity that a man can make is eternal life because that is the easiest opportunity to identify because the outcome is guaranteed so if this is not a business whether some risk involved whether the company can go bankrupt this is an opportunity where you already know how it's going to end for god to love the world that is that he gave his only son that whoever believes in might receive eternal life so you know that when the opportunity comes to receive jesus christ there's no risk involved whether or not that's the right decision or not now you have the opportunity right now to make the right decision because there's records there's history there's a bible there are people who make the same decision as you and they can tell you what the outcome is so if you invest if you make the same decision they made accepting the same opportunity they took you will get the same reward they got amen when it comes to an opportunity there's an expression of window of opportunity or a dwarf opportunity no matter what metaphor you want to use it's always about something that can be open that can be closed so this conveys the thought that an opportunity can come and go it can be accessible one moment and gone the next ronald wayne today does not have the opportunity to keep his 10 percent share excites today doesn't have the opportunity to acquire google that opportunity came and it was gone so there's a window a time frame a specific window where it's possible to to act upon an opportunity and that is why we call you the juncture so there's a point in time where all circumstances are combined and unlined so perfectly that opens a window you have to take the window or it closes brother bottom says there's a kidney troubled lady right back there with the kidney condition you believe that god makes you well lady if you do raise up your hand and accept it respond to god's call you missed it i will show you whether you miss it or not it falls on this lady sitting right there with a handkerchief over her mouth this lady sitting right there also had a back trouble that's right lady yes sir you just come from an operation a cancer operation that's right your name is virginia that's right you're healed jesus christ makes you well you missed it mr anderson because you did not respond so the light moved upon a person a vision broke forth a window of opportunity to open up for a specific time frame she didn't act upon the window within that window the light moved upon somebody else that window closed and opened somewhere else that is how it is with an opportunity when god will give you a window if you do not take it the light moves upon somebody else a window of opportunity also called margin of opportunity or critical window is a period of time during which some action can be taken that will achieve a desired outcome once this period is over or the window is closed the specified outcome is no longer possible so you can only act within that window that you have if you do not respond to the opportunity like that sister here you miss your window can you bring up the the video of the rocket launch please just don't play it you can just bring it up in there's a window of opportunity or a window for a rocket launch it's a period of time where a particular rocket must be launched to reach its intended destination usually it's just a few hours if missed you must wait for the next window so if you can bring up the video and play it what you see in the middle there that's the sun and that's in the blue trajectory that's that's the path of the earth and then the green that's mars in purple that's a rocket that was launched with a payload called insight as you can see the earth is rotating mars is also rotating nothing is static waving so you have a window you have you can play it again you have a specific window to launch that payload so that it can reach its destination if you follow the video you will see exactly at what moment that payload arrives on mars in green so they line up perfectly because the rocket was launched within that window of opportunity if you had missed that window that rocket will not reach its destination so you only have a few hours and scientists they work so hard to find the windows of opportunity they call it orbital dynamics where what the conditions of the planet on earth and the conditions of the atmosphere in space are so lined up in a way that makes launching a rocket possible so they have to take those windows and in some cases what some some alignment of planets only happen once in 175 years you have to take that window or you have to wait another 200 years they're not going to be here so the way it's so critical to do what needs to be done when you have that window planting and harvest i think brother brother team died yesterday the bible said it was talking about the former reign of the latter in here there is a window for a gardener where you must plant where you must sow certain seeds to be able to receive a harvest so if you miss the season i i have no idea what i'm talking about by the way i don't understand seeds and plants and when to plant strawberries i want to print lettuce and tomatoes but there's a season where to plant tomatoes if you miss that window you have to wait because they will not grow the conditions will not be there anymore to be favorable for the growth of that seed so you have to take your window when it comes to reproduction there is a window where a woman is fertile if she doesn't receive seed in that window you have to wait for the next window when somebody has cardiac arrest you have about three to four minutes to perform cpr before they go brain dead so it's a critical window as soon as somebody goes in cardiac arrest you only have about three or four minutes and you can continue 10 minutes after but if you miss that window it's unlikely to save that person's life they'll be brain dead already because the only time that you're given to act is three to four minutes so you understand it in nature in science everywhere you look there are windows of opportunities that are given to us but if you don't take those windows what you wanted to do is no longer possible after a woman's fertility window has gone through you can no longer have a child after this opportunity window is missed nasa has to wait for the next one so it's up on us to take every single window of opportunity that is given to us and opportunity is a process an opportunity doesn't just happen like that you're like i just stumbled upon this great opportunity there's a process that's involved to bring about an opportunity so it's a combination as we say it's a combination of multiple events multiple circumstances and when they when they line up in a favorable way that's what we call opportunity but if we understood that it's not just a sudden appearing it's a building up then we could maybe appreciate more what an opportunity is for example when we come back to the lady who missed her chance of being healed it just didn't just happen and now she had an opportunity no somebody organized the meetings somebody paid for that building while the other meetings some newspaper ads or posters went above the meeting somebody heard about it and decided to come to the meeting there was a song leader who came and sang some songs people worshipping that service a prophet preached then people say amen to the word they responded to the word an atmosphere was created a prophet yielded to the holy spirit people started praying and believing and the light appeared in the room and the prophet followed that light it went upon somebody who believed a vision broke forth a window opened up then there is an opportunity but there is a building up there's a process many things that happen to lead to that moment of opportunity that is what happens in the service when you come to a moment where you receive an opportunity it just doesn't happen like that somebody prayed somebody fasted on monday night somebody was praying somebody studied the word somebody yielded somebody called somebody put the thought together to open a window of opportunity so if you understand all these circumstances line up to give you an opportunity tonight you will take your window [Applause] if you're mindful of an opportunity then you're more likely to stumble upon one or to identify one an opportunity comes to those who think about it you're more likely to let you find opportunity when it's alignment what's on your mind so if you're thinking about getting a car then when an opportunity comes to purchase a car you'll more likely be able to identify it because that's in line with what you're thinking about in in the world they seem to call it the law of attraction but the scripture talks about this in hebrews chapter 11 verse 15 talking about abraham who left his home the bible says and truly if they had been mindful of that country from once they came out they might have had an opportunity to return so if abraham when he left his house and left his family to follow the lord if he was constantly mindful he was thinking about what he left he would have received an opportunity to return so people that leave this message you know what they've been thinking about what they were mindful of because their mind was on the things that they left they got an opportunity to go back and when that opportunity came they took it because it's what they're mindful about so if you're mindful of something perhaps you need salvation and you're thinking about it lord i need to be saved because you're mindful you should be able to identify that tonight is your opportunity perhaps you need healing you should be able to identify that tonight is your opportunity maybe you're thinking about your life how down you feel your lord i'm so down i need comfort tonight will be your opportunity to receive comfort perhaps you're backslidden he said i need to come back home i don't know how tonight is an opportunity because an opportunity is based on what you're mindful of people must might miss the opportunities but i'll tell you about one man who doesn't miss his opportunities and that's the devil the devil would take any opportunity he gets in job chapter 1 you know the story when the sons of god came before god the bible says satan also came amongst them the lord asked him have you considered my servant job he said job really there's a reason why he's like this you've protected him you've blessed him allow me allow me to go touch him thou has blessed the work of his hand his substances increase in the land but pull from that hand now and touch all that he have and he will curse me to thy face and the lord said to satan behold all that he hath is in thy power only upon himself put not for the hand so you can touch everything he has except him himself now here's the devil acting upon god's word talking about taking god at his word god told him that he could do it he did it so he when the bible says that he went and took his sons his his uh his substance his animal everything that he owned except his own life now the devil gets a second opportunity he comes back to god again god says fine you can touch him but don't take his life the bible says and job was covered from boys from the sort from the soul of his feet to the crown of his head talk about taking everything you can talk about taking your opportunity since god told the devil that he could do it he did it so let's say that the devil wants to touch joe but maybe an angel stepped forward and said don't touch him he says god said i can the angel will back up because here is the devil act upon what god said he could have how about you when god said you can have something if the devil comes what are you doing you say god said i can't and god told the devil concerning job all that he has is in the power but i want to tell you concerning god that all that god is is in thy power you can have all that he is if you want salvation you can have it if you want peace you can have it if you want to hold it you can have it all that god is is in thy power if the devil can act upon god's word and take his opportunity surely there's a church tonight that can act upon god's word and take every window of opportunity hallelujah the devil is not shy or hesitant to seize an opportunity the something about the devil is that he has an incredible ability to recognize an opportunity and take it when jesus was in the wilderness after fasting for 40 days he got hungry and tired there's his window he comes to tempt him and after being overcome by the word the bible says in luke chapter 4 verse 13 and when the devil had ended all the temptation he departed from him for a season in the hebrews until the opportune time so he departed until there'll be another opportunity so the devil the bible says he's always looking like like a roaring lion seeking whom he may devour so while you're busy in life the devil is every day putting his head he has all his screens looking to find an opportunity constantly looking at all his all his graphs and all his cameras everything where can i find an opportunity and if the devil gets one you better believe he's going to take it in matthew chapter 14 verse 22 and straightway jesus constrained his disciples to get into his ship and to go before him onto the other side while he sent the multitudes away and when he had sent the multitudes away he went up in the mountain apart to pray and when the evening was come he was there alone but the ship was down in the midst of the sea tossed with waves for the wind was contrary and in the fourth watch of the night jesus went unto them walking on the sea four things here or three things that you want to consider here in this in this verse number one is that the disciples went without jesus circumstances number one and then jesus went up on the mountain apart to pray circumstance number two then it was evening time circumstance number three and jesus was there alone number four the sheep was there in the midst of the sea now all these circumstances have combined and the door of opportunity opens for the devil if jesus was still with them maybe he would not have acted if they were still on land maybe we would have acted but because one the one without jesus two jesus is aware on the mountain three is now dark in the night not all these elements combined there is a window of opportunity that the devil is able to take very bad says about that time satan looked up over the rim and he saw the little boat out on the sea without jesus he thought here's my opportunity so it is tonight with every individual with every church with every member of the church when satan can see you alone without jesus it is his opportunity to smite you and brother cause goes on to say the devil was looking at them on the boat and he says i've caught them alone he's not with them now is my time to get even with them that's the way satan walks that's the way he watches that's the opportunity he waits for the devil is looking at your life every single day wanting to see if you're gonna give him a window if you're gonna do something without the lord if you're gonna go somewhere where god didn't lead you to go if you're gonna be disobedient whatever it is he's waiting watching your life carefully waiting for an opportunity and if you give him an opportunity he will smite you so tonight don't give the devil any opportunity keep your home clean don't open filthy shows on the television giving me a window of opportunity to come into your family don't be yoked with evil and with worldly people yes it's fun to have friends but don't two people can all walk together unless you agree and before you know it because of that atmosphere you're constantly in the devil starts to see a window of opportunity to open you better believe he's gonna take it satan patiently waited for all the circumstances to line up in a way that was favorable to achieve what he wanted to do which was to destroy the disciples and he will wait for you to reach your lowest point and a window opens for depression he will wait for you to reach your highest point and a window for pride opens up he will wait for you to go outside of god's will then a window comes from him to do whatever he wants because you are not protected when you're outside of god's will and the devil will watch you disobey the lord and then the spirit of disobedience which is the spirit of witchcraft will come inside of you oh i hate that spirit disobedience to know what the law requires of you but not to do it so the devil is always able to see the juncture that point in time where circumstances are favorable and sometimes it pays off the devil takes every opportunity he gets sometimes he's successful sometimes it doesn't but a true son of god when he recognizes an opportunity it always pays off always the devil can have ten thousand opportunities and you will take each one of them some you'll be successful some you fail but if you take ten thousand opportunities every single time it will pay off i'm not going to belong tonight judas had an opportunity brother i'm saying he had the same opportunity as the rest of the disciples but he wasn't convinced that that was the messiah oh my he walked with jesus christ for three and a half years and he was never convinced that that was the messiah he came to church service after service but he was never convinced that the message was true he came to church every single wednesday every sunday and every camp but he was never convinced that this was the truth i tell you if you're on the fence tonight here's the wind of opportunity can i be convinced that this message is true matthew 26 16 then one of the 12 disciples called judas went unto the chief priest and said unto them what will you give me and i will deliver him unto you and the covenant with him for 30 pieces of silver and from that time he sought opportunity to betray him he had the opportunity to identify christ as the messiah and to be convinced that that was the messiah but because he rejected that opportunity he didn't take it he wasn't sincere he didn't desperately look for god to make that message real to him he was okay with association he was okay with fellowship but done in his soul there was never a real conviction about the message of the hour because he didn't take that window the devil gave him another and now the bible says from that time on he started looking for an opportunity to betray the world oh my if you reject the opportunity to receive christ the devil will give you multiple opportunities to betray this message don't you betray this message it is not said the lord it is the word of god for this day don't you betray it if you're not convinced you'd better get convinced tonight don't put up for another service you better receive truth tonight before you betray this glorious word imagine judas jesus christ is praying for the sick and he's looking do i have a window no the manic of gaddera comes running to jesus christ for deliverance jesus is looking that's not my window then he finds a window where christ is praying in the garden then when he got his window he took it but all those years instead of looking for an opportunity to receive christ and to be convinced he is looking for an opportunity to betray such as people today coming to church looking for an opportunity to criticize looking for an opportunity to be offended about something so they might get a reason an opportunity to live i was hurt because you were looking for an opportunity and when you got your door you left the love of the world was sealing those people when they gathered the opportunity they took it and left it was never about the message it was never about the ministry it was not about brother branham it was what was in their heart and when they got the opportunity they took it those who left the prophet they had the opportunity and they were looking for it and when they got to serpent seed there's my opportunity some other people in the bible had opportunities and they took it jacob one night had an opportunity with the angel of the lord he knew that his life he needed his life to be changed he knew that he needed his walk to be changed he knew that he needed a nature change for he was a shy story deceiver and he wanted his nature to be completely transformed and when that night a door of opportunity opened up and the angel luck came down in the scene he said i will not let you go because this is my window of opportunity but angelo told him it's almost morning this window of opportunity is almost closed he says i'm not done with you yet i will not let you go can you fill me with the holy ghost i will not let you go do you convince me of this message i will not let you go do you change my life you take your win of opportunity tonight oh i pray that a window will open tonight and the end of the law will come here and you can take your opportunity [Applause] [Music] glory [Music] i just got this in the back study just now the main neck of gadara mark chapter five this man that we know as legion was possessed with demons this man was possessed and i'm talking about possession so the demons control where he lived they made him cut himself they controlled his tongue because they spoke back to jesus and anybody who come to tame him he beat them down none of his own strength but demons but the bible says in verse 6 when he saw jesus hallelujah when he saw that window of opportunity he ran to jesus christ bob says and worship how can a man who's demon possessed be able to worship worship is a one way a two-way channel between you and god when you begin to worship even if you're demon possessed the devil cannot take control of your tongue you'll be allowed to say glory to god you'll be able to say praise the lord because worship is between god and the elect even if you're demon possessed i don't care your situation if you can't do worship when you see your window of opportunity and you begin to worship in that window the devil can touch you in that window the demons couldn't control his tongue in that window they couldn't control his legs he was able to run down worship oh hallelujah oh my that's so strike me somebody who's so demon possessed but when a window of worship opens up demons cannot control him [Applause] after he finished worship now the demons could able to speak again and say what do we have against us jesus on the most high they couldn't speak while he was worshiping they couldn't prevent him from going to jesus because he saw his wind of opportunity oh my simply worship worship worshiping it doesn't matter if you feel low it doesn't matter what your circumstances are if you're able to worship in that window of worship the devil cannot catch you [Applause] glory oh can we just worship him for a little bit tonight oh praise the lord how worthy he is he is worthy to be praised he is worthy of everything of adoration of praise of glories of hallelujahs in this window all the demons that bind you have to flee in this window if you worship sit and foster your feet in this window all things are possible hallelujah glory hallelujah hallelujah oh praise the lord hallelujah there was a man called simon the pharisee who wanted to have jesus over for dinner he sent his courier to go the message for jesus and brother branham explains the scene so perfectly this man runs and he's on his horse perhaps and he's running to go see jesus and he sees the crowd and he's pushing people and he's looking for jesus and he says maybe peter says sir i have a message from my master for your master then he goes on to see jesus and say my master simon would like to have you over for dinner jesus says sure i'll come jesus keeps all his appointments right by him says and then he says oh thank you and he's so happy gets back on his horse riding back to his master to say i found jesus he said he will be here i've done my job but i to say what a foolish thing to do he was standing before the prince of all princes and he had an audition with him he had an interview with the king of glory and failed to seize opportunity oh my he didn't catch what his opportunity was see he only came to do what his master asked him but if he recognized who that man was perhaps in his own life he would have never had a chance to meet jesus but because of his master he was able to go with a message to jesus that gave him a window for his own self perhaps the disciples said no you can't touch him but because he had a message from his master for jesus they let him go then he had his window of opportunity and left bravo says oh i'd like to take his place i'd like to get to jesus sometime i'll try i'll try to go daily for your troubles but never do i ever leave him when i'm in his presence until i worship him oh my i've taken upon myself just something between me and the lord when i see the back of every service as soon as i begin to feel the presence of the lord i say welcome because when i'm in his presence i have to worship when i'm in his presence and i recognize that he has descended i have to let him know how i feel about him and i will never leave the sanctuary or my room or wherever i am in the car when i feel his presence without worshiping him you take every opportunity that you have to worship to tell him you love him to tell him how much it means to you is he here tonight then you can tell that you love him don't be like that courier who can get in the presence of the lord without taking some opportunity i don't know what tomorrow is i might not be here tomorrow but as long as i'm in the presence of the lord i would like my last deeds my final actions on nerf to be the in his presence i worship him perhaps you're a senior friend tonight i don't know what your situation is but even in your sinful condition if you're in his presence even if you don't feel it i tell you he is here because of that you can worship him that he can stand for you that day say even though he never received the holy ghost in my presence he worshipped and acknowledged me got to acknowledge him hallelujah salvation is very easy it's the story of redemption it's a story of windows of opportunity that every man took noah came with the ark and there was a door god sent the prophet there is a door and brad says when you receive the gift the god is sent in the day it opens up an age of golden opportunity but going to hell is harder than getting saved because for you to be lost it means that every window of opportunity you rejected it's not easy to do that everyone says in two days the same thing the very same thing we are given the opportunity because god cannot judge without first having or without first giving his warning if you told a certain person going down the road speeding stop and say there's a hole down the road there if you continue to speed you'll be killed and they say nonsense i know what i'm doing then you see the blood can be upon you because you have thoroughly warned them well god does the same thing by his word he thoroughly warns the people of uncoming judgment and shows his sign and wonders that's predicted in the bible for that age he shows them and the people just walk right over it it's not easy for a person to go to hell a man fights his way to hell a man fights his way to hell the first lie you ever told you know it was wrong the first cigarette you ever smoked you know that was wrong the first evil you did you know that was wrong but in your conscious something told you was wrong but you continually ran through the red light ran over the barricades you're reckless you want to do it anyhow to show that you're some big guy huh see but remember you fight your way to hell it is not easy to go to hell you have to reject truth and i'm not preaching hell tonight to scare anybody but i'm saying the way to hell is more difficult than the way to salvation salvation is one opportunity you take it hell is rejecting truth over and over and over again how many windows have you had if you've been raised in the church for 20 years i guarantee you've had a window at least every service how many windows are you rejecting to fight your way to hell you say that if i was in the date of jesus maybe i would have stood for him by everyone says that you have a more you have more of an opportunity to stand for him tonight than you would have back in those days because the opposition today is greater than it was then you say if i was with the disciples and i saw jesus christ in the flesh surely i would have stood for him but the opposition today the forces of hell today against the truth are harder there are more fierce today than then so if you serve god today and stand for him today that is a greater opportunity than the disciples what you have today is a much greater opportunity why won't you take it can you bring the last slide please yes these slides are questions that i found on on the internet of people regular people like you and i who missed an opportunity in their life can you all see it i'll let you i'll let you read some of those questions these are questions asked in different websites different forums of people who miss their opportunities can you bring it up here so i can see it please yep okay thank you somebody said how do i deal with the regret of missing an opportunity someone else says how do you overcome blaming yourself for missed opportunities how can i stop regretting for the mistakes i did and opportunities i missed in the past i missed the job opportunity of a lifetime three months later and it still upsets me i also lost all motivations to apply for any other job what can help me what is the best way forward how do you deal with regret and past mistakes in life what how do i deal what could have been and miss opportunities how does one make up or cope with the loss of a once in a lifetime opportunity i have made a mistake and lost a once in a lifetime opportunity i don't think i'll be able to do anything worth off in my life now it sucks what should i do these are people like you and me who had opportunities in life and they didn't take it and regret sets in and you don't go posting questions like that if you're not actually looking for help these are people that don't know how to deal with the regret of not taking a window of opportunity so with missed opportunities in this lifetime comes regret self-blame depression sense of worthlessness deep remorse and torment but when this life is over it's over right but when it comes to eternal life those regrets will be what will fuel the lake of fire here are some other questions that some characters in the bible would have asked if they had the internet they're not on the slab show but perhaps judas after he betrayed jesus he logged on his computer and typed i was called to be a part of the greatest ministry on earth and for 30 pieces of silver i sold my soul how can i get over it that was judas he couldn't get over here to kill himself cain after killing and rejecting god's provided way and he had a mark and he was gone cast away perhaps he logged on his computer and typed i had an opportunity to worship god once he even told me how to be accepted but i couldn't bring myself to obey out of pride it's been many years now i still see that mark on my forehead to remind me of this opportunity i miss how do i get over it he could never get over it i once had a chance to be in the lineage of the messiah but i failed to see the opportunity of the birthright and i sold it to my brother because i couldn't see the value of it since then all the blessings and everything has flown through my brother and i just can't stop blaming myself what can i do perhaps a young rich ruler went and typed i was a successful investor and at a very young age i had an incredible portfolio of real estate and businesses i had the greatest opportunity of my life to invest in the policy for eternal life the offer came directly from the offer of all life and i just couldn't risk my other businesses since then i've been depressed and tormented by this how do i cope with this how do i even find motivation to keep running my businesses he ended up in hell now all these men if only they could type and perhaps express how they felt that's probably what they would say but the saddest thing is that in hell there's remembrance and you have no chance at all to repent but you remember the opportunities you've turned down it's one thing to go through those questions for a couple of years but it's one thing to have to endure them over and over and over and over again being tormented by those windows that closed problem says you say unto me then preacher says remember us in hell jesus said there was the rich young man that lifted up his eyes he saw abraham and lazarus in his bosom and he said remember in your lifetime there is remembrance and how they lost what an awful thing that would be to know that the great meetings that they had set in and and heard the mighty sermons of the unknown ministers of god and not only that but to see the anointed signs and wonders that god had performed among the people and then to remember all these warnings and be lost it will help them forever not only have you seen what god has done in this history of prophet you've seen what god has been doing in this church for the past few weeks you've seen souls getting saved you've seen people that were dead and sin for years being quickened back by the power of god we've seen names on our prayer meeting bored being affected last being changed you've seen it you've had service after service you have windows of the windows do not take this window tonight it will hunt you forever there was a woman a prostitute in the scripture that had her window of opportunity in closing we heard about the courier will give the invitation to jesus christ and he came to the feast he came to that dinner he came with dirty feet there's nobody there to welcome him nobody there to clean his feet as it was custom to do nobody there to give him the softest slippers as brother banana would say nobody there to pour oil upon him to to maybe help him with the heat against his skin and then he went into the house to keep his appointment because he was invited he was left in a corner and entertained jesus keeps all his appointment right balaam says you invite him to come and then he comes but when he comes what do you do some have prayed for a move of god in the church we have a move of god in the church what are you doing some say that i need a fire of god in this church we are the fire god in this church they have left some say i need to be in the presence of the law we need god to move the border is open you have your opportunity now this woman just happened to see that jesus was there now we talk about opportunities being a process simon was a pharisee who had money so when he was born god watched over him god help him be successful in life god prospered his businesses god gave him a name and a reputation that he had friends amongst the pharisees because god had in mind a prostitute now that processor bought an alabaster box from the store god watched over that store owner god gave him the inspiration to open his store god prosper his business god made him buy inventory so he would have alabaster boxes available for this woman that opportunity that didn't appear out of nowhere it was a process in the making god prospered this person that person brought this one that way to bring all the circumstances to be aligned so that somebody might have an opportunity you're not just here by accident somebody prayed somebody watched over your father somebody watched over your mother somebody called brother from toronto to be here to open a church here somebody called the prophet and the messenger and sent him somebody call it ministry here tonight somebody put this meeting together somebody paid for this building somebody inspired this sermon somebody pray the prayer you pray so that all these circumstances align tonight might be a window of opportunity for you [Music] she sees jesus by himself in the corner and as we talked about an opportunity to come to those that are mindful of it so no doubt she's thinking no doubt the previous day of the last week of the last month he's pondered before bed oh god why am i like this why can't i just overcome this why can't i get delivered from this depression why cannot overcome this sin that so easily besets me i want to serve you but why can i get over this lifestyle why can't i bring myself to a full surrender why can't i separate myself with all worldliness and focus on you and she's pondered and pondered why and she was mindful because she was mindful and opportunity came and when she saw jesus she said this is my window she ran back home she grabbed her little site with money she started counting by the way and says all the coins and she stopped to say oh no he he certainly know how i got this money he will certainly know how i got this money but i can't go to him without anything i have to offer something back i have to give my praise i i have to show how much it means to me i have to show how much i value this opportunity that i've been given and i have to do something okay it doesn't matter if you cast me away then let me cast me away but me i have to take this door of opportunity or if sinners have that attitude i will come to the altar if you reject me he rejects me but i will still come and take my opportunity if i perish i perish well i need to go to see the king and take my opportunity you don't even need any guarantee that jesus will accept you if you accept you is by his mercies but he has still given you a guarantee in the world that he will not cast you away and she comes to the house of simon and simon is having a good time with his friends you can hear the wine glasses they can hear the music and she looks for jesus and she sees him in the corner by himself and she comes to him falls down at his feet she said all my life all my life i've been waiting for this opportunity i've been waiting for this opportunity to be delivered from this spirit i've been wanting from this opportunity to have my life transformed i've been waiting for this opportunity to finally surrender my left to christ i've been waiting for this opportunity to receive my healing this was her opportunity and she started crying and she started weeping oh brother branham says if jesus had moved one foot it would stall her and she would have ran out of that place so fast so quickly he never moved everyone says sometimes he can get out of order he will be okay with it he will let you get out of order for a little bit and he says give us services where people can get out of order because jesus will let you do it the problem is that we are too in order he let her do it he let her weep he let her cry and she's repenting and her tears are speaking volume oh the bible says our tears are bottled he's bottled all our tears and perhaps tonight god has in his museum brother mike can i fellowship around this perhaps in his museum he has a bottle and he goes by it and says i remember this those are the tears of that woman when she wept and washed my feet it meant so much to him that he bottled her tears and brahma says the tears of a repenting sinner are precious in his sight your tears of repentance are going to be bottled up and you will carry they say these are the tears of my son when he came and surrendered his life to me these are the tears of my daughter but she was plagued year after year she took a win of opportunity she wept and wept and washed his feet with her tears and before you know it her hair is falling down and she starts to dry them with her hair and she starts to kiss his feet and just worship and say lord i'm a sinner i'm a sinner but you're my opportunity whomever in heaven on earth beside me oh savior hear my humble cry this woman was not the one who invited jesus simon was the one who invited jesus even though somebody else was the one to invite him she was able to see an opportunity you might be a sinner perhaps you didn't pray to come to church today and somebody else invited christ to come in these meetings somebody else prayed on worship and invited the lord to come back in this meeting and the lord came upon somebody else's invitation but that doesn't mean that you cannot take advantage of that opportunity she was not the one who invited the messiah simon did but she was able to say regardless this is my opportunity perhaps you came to church tonight not wanting anything about god perhaps you didn't care about why you came to church but then christ came and you sing in your window take it now think about this what this woman is doing is so unusual this is a dinner party if there's a place to be more conscious of what you're doing it'll be at a party with dignitaries rich people fancy dressed that's where you maybe you'll be self-conscious what are they gonna think about me what are they gonna say about me is this really the place to do this but her she didn't let any of that hinder her but it's surprising that in church we find it unusual to cry unto god where are you going to cry at a party that's what she did at a dinner party she went for repentance this is the most prosper this is the most adequate place to do what she did she did it at a dinner party because you couldn't be in church you are in church what better place than church than for repenting sinners to come what better place than church to touch the home of his garment and then we think what are people going to think about me i'll tell you what we're gonna think this is normal that's what we're gonna think we ought to normalize whipping sinners back to calvary [Music] [Applause] [Music] came anyhow because he would take any place you give him he never he never complained about being in the corner he never complained about being unattended he never complained about his dirty feet he was happy to come because he was invited he will take any place you give him you may stand tonight and say i accept him as my savior he will take that you can come to the altar he will take that you can decide i'm just going to sit in my seat he will take that you can say i won't say anything i'll just say in my heart he will take that but he deserves the best you can give so if you can make a public declaration that he is your savior that is the best you can give him because if you're not ashamed of him tonight he will not be ashamed of you then [Applause] jesus sees this woman coming and he looks at her he's a prophet and he sees this dark shadow over her and you know she's a sinner vision breaks for if he sees your life and is watching but he lets her come she weeps she cries she worships she kisses his feet then simon gets upset because somebody in the church has stood up some man gets upset because somebody decided to cry out to the lord someone gets upset because in the church people lift up their hands in worship and jesus said gives him a parable and say who loveth much he says i guess to him they forgive the most he said you have judge right says i came upon your invitation you didn't worship me you didn't wash my feet you didn't anoint my head with oil but this woman says she hasn't stopped as he's speaking she is still doing it as a preacher is preaching you're still doing it in your heart oh god and jesus turns back to her as he was worshiping he's watching her and saying oh it's turning lighter that dark shadow is turning lighter as you worship it turn a little bit more lighter he said let me wait a little bit until it's completely light she kept worshiping as you worship that darkness in your life turns light that depression is going away slowly because you're starting to respond to the word maybe you're not seeing amen from your lips but something in your heart is saying that is true that is the beginning of that darkness turning into light when she was done worshiping jesus was done talking to simon he turns to her and it's all right glory the darkness is gone he say my sins which are many are forgiven oh hallelujah i want my sins forgiven hallelujah thy sins which many are forgiven because she loved much so she was forgiven because she worshipped her sins were forgiven we don't have any record of that woman even saying a prayer all she did was respond to a window of opportunity perhaps tonight you don't even have to say a prayer but if you can respond to your window of opportunity you will receive forgiveness of your sins all by the wrist standing there you're forgiving of your sins brother lord you're forgiven brother ray gabe and jericho joseph everybody here who's responding you're forgiven hallelujah [Applause] oh god oh god oh god oh god [Music] oh god oh i bless your name lord i bless your name oh god oh god [Music] oh hallelujah musicians why don't you come [Music] he doesn't have dirty feet tonight but he has nails card feet you can come and kiss his nails card feet and come and kiss his nail scarred hands because christ is the ultimate window of opportunity for god to love the world that he opened a window of opportunity for his son jesus christ hallelujah hallelujah oh god i don't even know where to go from the earth last wednesday i was sitting in the back there i prayed a prayer no money prayer meeting something i needed the lord to deal with me on and i listened to a tape or a sermon that once a night and i prayed on my way to church lord speak to me through brother michael i came to church and he spoke unhindered and i was able to recognize my window of opportunity and i took it and god dealt with me and god rewarded me because i took my window take your arena tonight since we're speaking of a window i will give you your window if you need jesus christ come to the altar i'll give you your window check it if you need a request a question this is your winner to be refilled the holy ghost take your window if you're balanced with a spirit that you need to break free from i'll give you a window check it [Music] if you need deliverance from some unclean habits that you can seem to overcome i will give you a window take it [Music] if you need to accept jesus christ as your savior and be baptized in the name of jesus christ here's your window take it if you want to baptism even tonight i'm pretty sure they'll accommodate and baptize you in the water take your window he wants to get baptized you talk to brother tom [Music] if you're backslidden and you've made a step towards god but you're not fully finished and you need to come to a full surrender take your window in the name of the lord by begging you to take your window [Music] if you're feeling cold in your experience with the lord and you need a task from god so that he can put fire in your bosom check your window [Music] if you're broken-hearted and you need healing take your window if you're wounded in your spirit by a hurt by plagues by complexes by questions check your window tonight if you're worried about what family will say what friends will say about your lifestyle take your window [Music] oh god [Music] you know what it's like you know what it's like to miss an opportunity don't miss tonight it's your opportunity don't miss it don't miss it it won't cost you anything but to come to him he will take you with open arms take your window of opportunity [Music] is there an old soldier that's weary and tired who needs to receive shrimp tonight say lord i've watched cold a little bit i need to put more fire in me i've been in this for a long time but i'm getting a little bit colder perhaps my wife is not noticing plus my children don't notice but lord here's my wind of opportunity let me take it [Music] there's a window here's a window check your window [Music] put out somebody in the background i don't know i just have to call anywhere i can i have to give each one of you an opportunity if there's a window for you that's open up why don't you come and take your window before this window closes i understand the value of this opportunity understand the labor that went into it understand what god has done for you to receive this opportunity hallelujah [Music] take your opportunity in the name of the lord don't look at me look at god forget me i'm nothing here's everything take opportunity [Music] oh hallelujah father i hope you're pleased tonight i've done my best oh god i've labored in prayer lord and study not knowing how this service will go by following your leadership lord the being is incurring my own personality by yielding to you that somebody might receive a window of opportunity tonight hallelujah [Music] hallelujah since we have to normalize these meetings this is the most appropriate place to have an encounter with god this is not in the workplace this is not a some party this is the house of god why you should be normal to whip your way to calvary [Music] take your opportunity how precious are your tears how precious are your feet tonight i led you to this altar how precious are those hands that you lifted up before god he will not reject your prayer you worshipped you desire
