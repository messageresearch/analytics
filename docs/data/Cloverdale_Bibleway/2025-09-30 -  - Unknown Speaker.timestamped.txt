[0:00] while you have strength. Don't wait till
[0:02] you're laying someplace and and and
[0:04] breathing and gasping saying, "Well, if
[0:06] I only had my strength back, I'd go and
[0:08] do something for God." Do it now. Do it
[0:10] while you have your strength.
[0:12] &gt;&gt; Why? Because that word is energized.
[0:16] &gt;&gt; How many believe that this word is
[0:18] energized?
[0:19] And it's energized with a divine
[0:22] guidance system
[0:25] &gt;&gt; to take you to the ultimate destination.
[0:30] &gt;&gt; He said the word is again today being
[0:33] waved over the people. The word the
[0:36] locos because out from him has come a
[0:39] ride. We're going to conclude this age.
[0:43] I believe he has confidence. I have a
[0:46] people on earth that believe the word.
[0:48] They've consumed the veil. They know who
[0:52] I am and they know that I am in them and
[0:54] they are in me. And they are preparing
[0:58] now for the rapture because Satan has so
[1:01] contaminated our thinking that somehow
[1:04] we've got an allowance for a mistake
[1:06] that I'm going to announce to you
[1:07] tonight. This night will not miss on one
[1:10] word. You Lorns, Methodists, Baptists,
[1:14] Pentecostals, and nothing and world and
[1:17] sinners, come out
[1:20] and be identified
[1:22] with your true lineage. It's not that
[1:25] you have to hear something new. Let God
[1:27] inspire the message you already know.
[1:30] &gt;&gt; You don't need something new. You need
[1:32] the fire
[1:34] &gt;&gt; to quicken what you already have. They
[1:37] ate there and they died. You're eating
[1:40] now to live. I have confidence that
[1:43] we're going to sit around the married
[1:45] supper table and we're going to look
[1:47] into one another's faces and a lamb will
[1:50] come and dry our tears away. Something
[1:53] one day that called and said, "I want
[1:56] you to preach the gospel." It's him,
[1:59] Christ. And if it's not Christ, you
[2:02] folks are wasting your time. You ought
[2:04] to go and find yourself a pastor. That's
[2:06] what you need. You need somebody who
[2:08] speaks on behalf of Christ
[2:11] so that there's something inside that
[2:12] says that's the truth. I'll hang on to
[2:16] that and stake my life on it. That's
[2:19] what you need.
[2:22] [Music]
