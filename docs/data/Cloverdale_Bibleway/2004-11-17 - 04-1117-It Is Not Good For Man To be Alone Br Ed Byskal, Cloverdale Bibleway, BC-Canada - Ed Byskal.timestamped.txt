[0:09] see.

[0:15] what the cross
[0:17] or how heavy
[0:19] the cross.
[0:21] I want
[0:24] to be here to hear me. Let's sing again.
[0:30] Oh, I want
[0:32] to be here
[0:38] for some days.
[0:43] I want to see
[0:52] for
[0:54] the cross.
[0:56] I don't want
[0:58] to be here today.
[1:05] Amen. And I trust that nothing here will
[1:10] hinder you. And that goes from the
[1:12] little children
[1:14] all the way up to the oldest ones. There
[1:16] are many things that can Satan can throw
[1:18] as a
[1:20] uh like a little missile to knock you
[1:22] off target, to knock you off course, but
[1:25] we're just trusting that the Lord will
[1:27] see us through. Amen. Let's turn the
[1:29] screen on to 429.

[2:37] where he may
[2:40] thousand years
[2:43] shining
[2:44] as the sun
[2:48] we know
[2:52] our praise.

[4:02] Must I be carried up to the skies on a
[4:08] flower made of me?
[4:13] I'll let you in the right dancing on the
[4:20] bloody.
[4:23] But I've got my
[4:25] and I've got my heart.
[4:28] Oh, I'm going with Jesus all the way.
[4:33] I've got my mind
[4:36] and I've got my heart.
[4:39] Oh Lord, I'm going with Jesus all the
[4:42] way. Let's all stand. Are there no more
[4:47] glory to face?
[4:52] I stand by

[5:01] to
[5:11] Oh, I'm going with you always.
[5:16] I got my body.
[5:19] I got my heart.
[5:22] I'm going with Jesus all the way.
[5:27] Sure. I must fight. If I were for it, I

[6:32] Hallelujah.
[6:33] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[6:34] &gt;&gt; Amen. Have you got your mind made up?
[6:36] &gt;&gt; If you were on the fence when you came
[6:37] in, I recommend get off the fence.
[6:40] &gt;&gt; Cuz if you're a fence sitter, you got to
[6:42] make sure you know whose ground the
[6:44] fence is in
[6:46] &gt;&gt; because it's his ground that owns the
[6:48] fence. And if you're sitting on his
[6:50] fence,
[6:51] you've made your decision.
[6:53] &gt;&gt; So, we want to make sure we aren't fence
[6:55] sitters tonight. Amen. Are you happy?
[6:58] &gt;&gt; Glad to be in the house of the Lord.
[7:00] &gt;&gt; Amen. Let's sing Can't You See Why I'm
[7:02] Happy? Number 305, key of C.
[7:06] Oh, can't you see
[7:10] why
[7:11] I'm so happy?
[7:15] For I accepted
[7:18] the word of the Lord.
[7:24] I reveal
[7:27] a word that was
[7:33] by the pro
[7:37] I
[7:50] accepted
[7:52] the word

[8:00] word that was
[8:06] by the prophet
[8:10] by
[8:12] one more time. Oh, can't you see
[8:17] my
[8:19] glory?
[8:23] For I sent in
[8:25] the word
[8:27] of the Lord,
[8:31] the redeemer
[8:40] I

[8:58] the Lord.

[10:21] be in your presence tonight, Lord, to
[10:24] call you our Lord.
[10:27] &gt;&gt; Lord, to be your children, Lord, Lord,
[10:30] but no longer children, Lord, but bride,

[10:50] What a privileged people we are saints.
[10:53] Amen. We want to go to prayer at this
[10:56] time
[10:57] and ask brother Aaron McGary. Brother
[11:00] Aaron if you'd come. I know you're
[11:02] visiting with us. Very good to see you
[11:06] in our direction if you'd come and open
[11:08] the service in a word of prayer. Take
[11:10] the needs to our Lord. Amen.
[11:14] want to remember sister Rachel Stall.
[11:18] She says, "Please remember Sister Anne
[11:20] Langroot in prayer tonight as she is
[11:23] home with the flu."
[11:27] Also got a prayer request from Luis
[11:29] Wood. Plea says, "Please pray for
[11:32] Charity. She has been getting hot and
[11:35] cold and stomach pains."
[11:38] How many knows that our God can not only
[11:40] heal the body, but heal all those things
[11:42] that the believer touches? Amen. And
[11:44] she's pinned down a request the Lord
[11:46] would make a way that her tail lights
[11:49] would continue to work in her car
[11:51] because she's been having problems with
[11:52] that. Our God's a not a God just of bone
[11:56] and flesh and bone, but a God of all the
[11:59] creation. Amen. We just remember her
[12:01] tonight.
[12:04] Terry Tagert's penn down a request.
[12:06] Please pray for Jason Tagert as he is
[12:08] home quite ill with the flu looking to
[12:11] the Lord for a healing. How many knows
[12:12] when you make a commitment there comes a
[12:14] testing? Amen. We just want to join our
[12:17] hearts with brother Jason tonight that
[12:19] the Lord would lift him up. Got a
[12:21] testimony from Sister Lana who's very
[12:25] very sick with the flu for several
[12:27] weeks.
[12:29] She got prayed for last Wednesday night.
[12:32] Amen. The Lord has made her well. Amen.
[12:34] God bless you. Brother Aaron, would you
[12:36] come take these knees before the Lord?
[12:38] If you have a prayer request on your
[12:39] heart, something you desire the Lord to
[12:41] do for you tonight, just make it known
[12:43] by the uplifted hand. He's here to meet
[12:46] each and every need.
[12:50] Let's bow our heads. Our dear gracious
[12:52] heavenly father, Lord, we consider it a
[12:54] grand privilege to be gathered in your
[12:56] presence this evening.
[12:57] &gt;&gt; Yes, Lord. Lord, we just lift our hearts
[12:59] to you with thanksgiving for the grace
[13:02] and the mercy which you have shown us.
[13:04] Lord, we thank you for all the things
[13:06] that you have done in our lives. And
[13:09] Lord, knowing that you will continue to
[13:11] accomplish those things which concern
[13:12] us, that are beneficial to us. Lord, we
[13:16] want to be so sincere before you and so
[13:18] sensitive to your desires and what would
[13:21] be pleasing to you.
[13:23] So tonight, each one of us in unity just
[13:25] commit ourselves into your hands.
[13:28] We cast all our cares upon you
[13:31] &gt;&gt; and we lay aside the things of this
[13:33] world that we might just have a time
[13:35] together where we would concentrate
[13:37] completely upon you, desiring to hear
[13:40] your voice and see your face more
[13:41] clearly.
[13:43] May we be sanctified by your word. May
[13:45] we just be cleansed by the presence
[13:47] which is here and by the singing of the
[13:49] songs and by our entering in. May an
[13:52] atmosphere be created whereby we could
[13:54] hear what you would have us to receive
[13:56] tonight.
[13:57] Lord, may we be faithful to that
[13:59] calling. And Lord, we just bring these
[14:01] needs before you. Each one that was
[14:03] spoken, Lord, for both sickness, Lord,
[14:06] even the needs of tail lights, being
[14:08] able to work on cars. Lord, many of us
[14:10] have prayed before that you would touch
[14:12] our vehicles, and you've proven yourself
[14:14] even in those matters. Lord, you want to
[14:16] be involved in every aspect of our
[14:18] lives, from the greatest things to the
[14:20] smallest things. So, Lord, we pray that
[14:22] you'd manifest yourself in these needs
[14:24] which were brought before the church.
[14:26] Lord, also in all the unspoken requests
[14:28] that were made known by the lifting of
[14:30] hand or even just the whispering of
[14:31] lips, may you take control of those
[14:34] tonight as we commit them totally and
[14:35] completely into your hands. Lord, be
[14:38] with the minister tonight. May you just
[14:39] use them in a mighty way as we've all
[14:41] come here hungry and thirsty and weary,
[14:44] in need of a rejuvenation and a
[14:46] refreshing and our lives just to be
[14:48] transformed by revelation of the word.
[14:50] &gt;&gt; We love you, Father. Commit this service
[14:52] into your hands. In the name of the Lord
[14:54] Jesus Christ, we pray. Amen.
[14:59] &gt;&gt; Amen. God bless you as you have your
[15:01] seats.
[15:05] &gt;&gt; Amen. Well, we don't have to let you
[15:09] know that brother Aaron's visiting with
[15:10] us. He's here up from Dallas, Texas, I
[15:13] believe. Amen. If you're visiting with
[15:15] us tonight, we want to make sure that
[15:17] you feel welcome, not only in our
[15:20] presence, but in his presence.
[15:22] &gt;&gt; Amen. on the telephone hookups on the
[15:24] internet. We want to say God bless you
[15:26] to you as well.
[15:28] Let's turn the screen on to number 14.
[15:32] For Jesus set me free. Amen. Satan had
[15:35] me bound, but we're free tonight. We can
[15:39] sing like we're free.
[15:41] &gt;&gt; Amen. Not only let the Lord know that
[15:43] we're thankful that we're free, but let
[15:45] Satan know that he's lost us because
[15:47] we're free.
[15:55] I'm so glad Jesus set me free.
[16:00] I'm so glad
[16:02] Jesus set me free.
[16:05] I'm so glad
[16:07] Jesus set me free. Glory. Hallelujah.

[16:21] I'm so glad
[16:23] Jesus lifted me.
[16:26] I'm so glad
[16:28] Jesus lifted me. I'm singing glory
[16:32] hallelujah.
[16:34] Jesus lifted me
[16:38] and I shout glory. I'm on my way to
[16:43] heaven.
[16:44] Shouting glory, I'm on my way to heaven.
[16:49] Shouting glory, I'm singing.
[16:54] Jesus set me free. I'm blessing you. But
[17:00] Jesus set me free.
[17:05] Jesus set me free. Oh, take me down. My
[17:10] Jesus set me free. Glory. Hallelujah.

[18:10] where there is no way. I'm sorry.

[18:19] reading one song.
[18:21] Want to sing another one.

[18:26] It was a great thing. Amen.
[18:29] It was a great thing
[18:33] that he bore me.
[18:37] It was a great
[18:41] set free.
[18:44] Jesus died on Calary
[18:48] so that the whole world could see
[18:53] the
[18:55] and his glory.
[18:59] He was
[19:03] glory.
[19:17] Oh
[19:19] my
[19:22] greatness.
[19:44] I
[19:47] love all my
[20:04] &gt;&gt; God will make a way
[20:10] where there seems to me away.
[20:15] For he works in ways that I cannot see.
[20:22] He will make a way for me and he will be
[20:30] mine.
[20:33] Hold me closely to his side.
[20:39] For love and strength
[20:42] for each new day,
[20:45] he will make my way.
[20:50] God will make my way.
[20:55] Oh, God will make God
[21:01] mercy
[21:02] to me the way. Are you searching for
[21:05] that way tonight? He works in ways that
[21:09] you cannot see.
[21:12] He will make a way for me. I know that
[21:18] he will be my God.
[21:22] He all he calls me to his side
[21:28] with love and strength
[21:31] for each day.
[21:34] He will make a way.
[21:40] God will make a way. Let's make it a
[21:43] confession tonight. Each and every heart
[21:46] will make a way
[21:50] that cease to be a way
[21:55] for mercy in ways who we might not see
[22:04] a way for me. I know that
[22:09] my God
[22:12] hold me closely to his side
[22:17] with my strength
[22:20] for each new day.
[22:23] He will make a way.
[22:29] God will make our way.
[22:35] Hallelujah.
[22:37] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Jesus.
[22:40] Amen. As we invite Pastor Brother Biscll
[22:43] to come at this time, bring the word.
[22:46] Just want our hearts to be in tune with
[22:48] the spirit this evening. Amen. To see
[22:51] what he would have to say for us. It's
[22:54] not so much that counts what we think
[22:56] anymore, saints. It's all about what he
[22:58] thinks his mind for the hour. There are
[23:01] many things that we may have a direction
[23:04] that we think the Lord is going to take
[23:06] us in. It's not even close to what his
[23:10] reality is for us. We just want to
[23:12] remain flexible, remain open to his his
[23:15] perfect will for our lives. Amen. Sing
[23:19] number 48 on the screen as brother
[23:22] Biscll comes. So glad I'm yours, Lord.
[23:25] No longer my own.
[23:27] Amen. So glad I'm yours,
[23:32] Lord.
[23:34] I'm so glad I'm yours.
[23:40] So glad your mercy
[23:46] has followed me.
[23:51] I'm so glad you found
[23:55] me
[23:57] and set me free.
[24:02] So glad
[24:04] you're
[24:08] so glad I'm yours. Maybe we can all
[24:12] stand together. I'm so glad I
[24:18] I'm so glad
[24:21] you
[24:23] I'm so glad your mercy
[24:29] has
[24:31] me.
[24:34] Oh, you found me
[24:39] and set me free.
[24:45] So glad I'm yours, Lord.
[24:50] So glad I'm yours.
[24:56] Hallelujah.
[24:58] It's wonderful to belong to someone
[25:02] &gt;&gt; that we're just not isolated to our own
[25:04] selves. That's right in harmony with
[25:06] what I'm going to be approaching this
[25:08] evening. But this weekend, we're I don't
[25:12] know just how the Lord's going to lead
[25:14] the service. We've got a real busy time.
[25:18] We have brother Tony and Sister Rebecca
[25:22] arrive tomorrow. They were going to come
[25:24] back this morning, but they weren't able
[25:26] to change their tickets, so they're
[25:28] coming on tomorrow.
[25:31] Brother Murphy and his wife come back on
[25:35] Friday.
[25:36] And brother Mustafa from Turkey, who has
[25:39] the radio station there, and his sister
[25:42] are coming also tomorrow. And so this
[25:46] coming weekend, we just want the
[25:47] leadership of the Holy Spirit.
[25:49] &gt;&gt; Amen. And there's nothing that is uh can
[25:53] take precedent over the word. The word
[25:57] is supreme.
[25:59] We love the word. We're children of the
[26:01] word. We're not interested so much in
[26:04] program as we are in having the word
[26:07] revealed to us. That's the greatest
[26:10] thing that we can have. Just happy to
[26:12] have each one of you here. Without you,
[26:15] we wouldn't be having a a service at
[26:17] all. So, we're so thankful. Nice to have
[26:20] our brother Aaron McGregor here. God
[26:23] bless you. Uh just got the note just
[26:26] before the service that you're here.
[26:28] Thank you. Nice to have you.
[26:31] Maybe just before we read the scripture,
[26:34] perhaps not so much for you, but for me,
[26:37] our brother Derek just leads a wonderful
[26:39] song service as do our other song
[26:42] leaders of course, but I I sometimes I
[26:46] like to just sing something and that's
[26:48] quietens my own spirit just before we
[26:50] come to the word. It's always a nervous
[26:51] time. People say, "Well, don't you get
[26:55] uh oh, it's just just second nature to
[26:58] you, brother Ed?" Oh, yeah. You just
[27:00] want to do it once and after you do it a
[27:03] thousand times it'll be still the same.
[27:05] Just a nervous time because if it's not
[27:07] then I don't think you're doing it
[27:09] right. You know it just wants to be a
[27:11] you just want to be able to say what God
[27:14] would have said. Amen. Uh I I'd like to
[27:18] just sing that worthy hear the cries. I'
[27:21] I've come to love that song because I
[27:23] was one of those.
[27:26] I was shackled,
[27:28] but I heard the voice.
[27:30] Amen.
[27:32] Hallelujah.
[27:34] And he is worthy. He's worthy of
[27:36] everything that we can just give of
[27:39] ourselves to him today.
[27:44] Hear the cries
[27:46] of the shadow
[27:49] beyond
[27:52] time
[27:53] for the days
[27:56] of
[27:58] no way.
[28:02] See the tears
[28:04] of the broken
[28:07] the cry
[28:09] of the slaves.
[28:11] Is there no one
[28:14] worthy
[28:15] set us free
[28:20] in the cry
[28:25] for
[28:28] the shadow
[28:31] release from their
[28:37] and
[28:39] the hores?
[28:42] are swelling
[28:44] the song
[28:46] worth
[28:48] the lamb that was save
[29:05] the lamb
[29:07] that was saved.
[29:12] So worthy.
[29:16] Oh, so worthy,
[29:19] worthy,
[29:21] worthy.
[29:23] The lamb
[29:25] that was slain.
[29:29] They all
[29:32] aren
[29:51] joining
[29:53] the song.
[29:55] Worthy.
[29:58] Worthy
[30:03] is worthy.
[30:06] Oh, thank you. Worthy
[30:12] worthy
[30:20] is worthy.
[30:25] So worthy,
[30:37] &gt;&gt; our gracious, loving savior,
[30:42] our Lord Jesus Christ,
[30:45] deliverer,
[30:47] healer,
[30:49] &gt;&gt; savior of our souls and lover of our
[30:52] souls.
[30:55] Oh Lord God, we are coming today, this
[30:59] evening at the gathering time that you
[31:03] have allotted for us to gather here to
[31:07] feed upon the body word of the Lord
[31:10] Jesus Christ, the son of man revealed.
[31:14] Lord, I pray that you'll break the bread
[31:16] as you did to the those walking on the
[31:21] way to Emmas and you entered into their
[31:25] dwelling place. Come Lord here into the
[31:28] place where we worship and here Lord
[31:32] break the bread I pray. Oh Lord be made
[31:36] known to us in the way that you break
[31:39] the bread. I pray, Father, that you will
[31:42] take and even as you did, Lord Jesus, at
[31:45] the last supper, how you broke it and
[31:48] you distributed it to your disciples,
[31:51] distribute it again this evening. Lord,
[31:54] we've gathered here not to be idle.
[31:57] We've gathered here not to see one
[32:00] another. We've not gathered here to hear
[32:02] something new, but we've gathered here
[32:05] that we might worship and glorify your
[32:07] name. And thank you once again for the
[32:10] mighty deliverance that there was not
[32:12] enough devils in hell to hold us chained
[32:15] and in our shackles. But you came and
[32:18] delivered us. And we'll raise our voices
[32:20] and give you thanksgiving this evening.
[32:23] Lord, I pray you will receive it. I know
[32:25] that you will be lifted up. Be exalted
[32:28] amongst us. Let nothing hinder, oh God,
[32:32] the moving of your faithful Holy Spirit.
[32:35] Have the preeminence. Have the
[32:37] preeminence. we pray. Take every heart,
[32:39] Lord, and let it be soft and tender
[32:42] before you. We walk, oh God, softly
[32:46] before you.
[32:47] Take now, Lord, your word. And I pray
[32:49] that you will.
[32:52] Anoint me, oh God, to speak and anoint
[32:54] the people to hear. In the name of Jesus
[32:57] Christ,
[32:59] we ask it. Amen. Amen.
[33:04] I'm going to read out of Exodus. if
[33:06] you'd like to turn with me in your
[33:08] Bibles.
[33:10] And I will say while you're turning,
[33:11] it's nice to have our
[33:14] brother Ryerson here yet. He leaves
[33:16] tomorrow
[33:18] and I thought I would give him a a
[33:21] little bit of a rest. It's always a
[33:23] pressure to be preaching and so out of
[33:28] compassion, I let him take
[33:32] knowing what it's like. Exodus the 19th
[33:35] chapter.
[33:40] Uh we'll begin to read at the third
[33:43] verse
[33:51] and down through 8.
[33:54] And Moses went up unto God, and the Lord
[33:58] called unto him out of the mountain,
[34:00] saying, Thus shalt thou say to the house
[34:03] of Jacob,
[34:05] and tell the children of Israel,
[34:08] you have seen what I did unto the
[34:10] Egyptians, and how I bear you on eagle's
[34:12] wings, and brought you unto myself. Now
[34:17] therefore, if you will obey my voice
[34:19] indeed, and keep my covenant, then you
[34:23] shall be a peculiar treasure unto me
[34:27] above all the people of all the earth uh
[34:32] above all the pe all people, for all the
[34:35] earth is mine, and you shall be unto me
[34:38] a kingdom of priests, and an holy
[34:41] nation.
[34:43] These are the words which thou shalt
[34:45] speak unto the children of Israel. And
[34:48] Moses came and called for the elders of
[34:50] the people and laid before their faces
[34:53] all these words which the Lord commanded
[34:56] him. And all the people answered
[34:58] together and said, "All that the Lord
[35:01] has spoken, we will do."
[35:03] &gt;&gt; And Moses returned the words of the
[35:06] people unto the Lord. May God bless his
[35:09] word as you have your seats.
[35:17] I would like to I don't know if I can uh
[35:23] conclude this evening and I'm sure not.
[35:26] So Lord willing I will continue on
[35:28] Sunday if if that's the way the Lord
[35:31] directs the services to go. I would like
[35:33] to I want to speak on something I've
[35:36] been pondering for
[35:38] quite a few weeks now. I'd like to speak
[35:41] on the subject of the institution
[35:45] of the congregation.
[35:48] I want you to think about that for a
[35:49] moment. The institution
[35:52] of the congregation.
[35:55] Uh
[35:57] an institution
[35:59] is something that has been established
[36:03] or an an established order or a
[36:06] corporate body.
[36:09] and it has a has a quite an array of
[36:11] meanings and but we're not just
[36:13] interested in its meaning. We're
[36:15] interested in how it applies. So he he
[36:18] he he told the he told Moses here
[36:23] uh he said that you'll be a peculiar
[36:26] people.
[36:28] You'll be a kingdom of priests.
[36:31] You'll be
[36:33] uh
[36:35] a holy nation.
[36:38] Now, there was a time I'm just I'm
[36:41] wanting to just lay this foundation
[36:43] slowly. There was a time when the
[36:47] children of Israel
[36:49] were not even a children of Israel
[36:53] and they were not a peculiar people and
[36:56] they were not a holy nation
[36:59] and they were not a kingdom of priests.
[37:03] Now uh a a kingdom is a domain.
[37:08] It is a sovereignty of reign.
[37:12] It is a a a realm.
[37:16] And it comes from a a root word which
[37:20] declares it to be a not only a dominion
[37:24] but to become a king or a queen.
[37:28] He says, "Now if you'll follow my words
[37:29] and hear my covenants, you will be unto
[37:33] me a kingdom, a a holy kingdom, a
[37:38] righteous kingdom. You'll be that."
[37:41] And but furthermore,
[37:43] if they would become a holy kingdom,
[37:46] that would make God the king.
[37:51] &gt;&gt; You see, so it would make him the king.
[37:55] And if he become a king, there's a
[37:57] possibility that she'd become the queen.
[38:00] &gt;&gt; That's really what he's saying. You will
[38:02] be this if you follow if you follow this
[38:04] word. I just want to introduce that. And
[38:07] you'll be a nation or a people because
[38:11] they were descendants of Abraham.
[38:14] And uh uh a nation does not indicate a
[38:19] one person or one household. But the
[38:22] even the word in the Hebrew is it's like
[38:25] a swarm. You'll be a mass. There'll be a
[38:30] a countless number.
[38:33] If you follow my word now, and then he
[38:37] addressed them as the children of
[38:38] Israel. You'll see where I'm going in
[38:41] just a couple of minutes. He addressed
[38:43] them as the children of Israel.
[38:46] Now, now there you'll find if you were
[38:49] doing a search in the Bible, you'll find
[38:50] that there's always a first time.
[38:52] There's a first time he calls them the
[38:55] children of Israel. Then there's a first
[38:57] time he'll say you'll be a holy nation.
[39:01] There's a first time he didn't he didn't
[39:03] say that back in Genesis, but now he's
[39:06] saying it in Exodus. Brother Brennham
[39:08] says that when he, you know, he sent a
[39:10] prophet and under a prophet, he was able
[39:13] to call a nation out of a nation, but he
[39:16] wasn't able to do that earlier, but he
[39:18] did it then. He called a nation out of a
[39:20] nation. So, there had to be an appointed
[39:23] time that he could do that. Now, I found
[39:27] it very, very interesting. The first
[39:29] time that God refers to them, his
[39:33] people, as the congregation of Israel,
[39:37] the first time was in Exodus 12 at the
[39:42] killing of the Passover lamb. You will
[39:45] speak to the congregation of Israel. And
[39:49] the congregation now is something a
[39:52] little bit different. It is a it's it's
[39:54] a gathering. Now you're now I'm
[39:57] gathering the people and the word
[40:01] congregation is that it is from to be a
[40:05] witness.
[40:06] Now God is identifying them. You're
[40:10] coming now. You're going to be you're
[40:13] going to have redemption by blood
[40:16] and you are going to be a witness to me
[40:18] in the earth. Hadn't said that earlier.
[40:22] Now, you're going to be a congregation
[40:24] of of uh of of Israel, and you're going
[40:28] to be a testimony.
[40:30] You're going to And that it also comes
[40:34] from another root word, which is to
[40:37] return, to restore, to bear witness, to
[40:42] testify, or to say again and again and
[40:47] again. You're going to be a people
[40:49] that's going to be a testimony to me in
[40:52] the earth. And you'll be a testimony
[40:54] from one generation to the next one.
[40:56] You'll say it again and again. It'll be
[40:59] the same thing. You'll be a testimony
[41:02] all the time.
[41:03] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[41:04] &gt;&gt; You'll be a testimony. You're going to
[41:06] say it again and again. That's a
[41:07] witness. When they get a witness in a
[41:10] courtroom, one of the things they try to
[41:12] do is try to see find out if they could
[41:15] get that witness to say something
[41:17] different.
[41:19] When we were uh arrested,
[41:24] that was one of the first things I
[41:26] caught it right away. It said, "What's
[41:28] your name? How old are you? When were
[41:31] you born?"
[41:34] Well, if I if I said my age and then the
[41:37] time I was born didn't match with my
[41:39] age, they would catch. And the reason
[41:41] why they were saying they were asking,
[41:44] interrogating all five in different
[41:46] rooms, separating us all, they wanted to
[41:49] find out if we'd all say the same thing.
[41:52] And I thank God that's what they found
[41:54] out. That was one of the most profound
[41:56] testimonies to them. All these people
[41:58] said the same thing. Brother Brandham
[42:00] said to Billy Paul, "Always tell the
[42:03] truth. That way you can tell it the same
[42:05] every time. You tell it again and again
[42:08] and again." Oh, I love a testimony. A
[42:11] testimony of a believer. A testimony
[42:14] that's being lived out. It's the same
[42:16] today. It's the same when I'm 15.
[42:19] Brother Brandham says, "I preach the
[42:20] same when I was just a young preacher.
[42:22] Preach the same thing." Because he was
[42:24] saying the same thing and the same thing
[42:26] and the same thing. You're a testimony.
[42:28] And it's wonderful to have the same
[42:30] testimony.
[42:34] &gt;&gt; And bringing out a people out of Egypt
[42:38] was even a a type of the resurrection.
[42:41] Now, a family,
[42:44] I just gave that as a real quick
[42:46] introduction.
[42:48] A family is a multi-membered
[42:53] group
[42:54] of individuals
[42:56] that are tied together
[43:02] through an arrangement that God
[43:04] ordained.
[43:06] None of us here selected the family we'd
[43:10] be born into. Amen.
[43:13] &gt;&gt; None of us were asked ahead of time what
[43:18] where we wanted to be born, what kind of
[43:21] a family we wanted to be born in, what
[43:23] color we would be or the color of our
[43:25] hair, the color of our eyes, or how we
[43:28] would look. And if we and and the whole
[43:31] cosmetic industry today proves that a
[43:33] lot of folks aren't very satisfied with
[43:36] how they were born or what they look
[43:37] like. They're all busy changing it.
[43:42] It's true.
[43:43] &gt;&gt; It's a huge industry.
[43:50] &gt;&gt; Now, the Bible says this,
[43:54] "And the Lord God said,
[43:57] it's not good for man to be alone."
[44:01] There was no group. There was no family.
[44:05] There was no clan. There was no tribe.
[44:09] There was nothing
[44:11] just man by himself and God had made him
[44:15] in his image. And then he says it's not
[44:19] good God speaking now and the Lord God
[44:23] said it's not good that the man should
[44:27] be alone. I will make him and helpmate
[44:32] for him.
[44:35] Now we're going to go in some strange
[44:36] direction.
[44:38] It's not good for a man. And God wasn't
[44:42] just referring now to a human mate, but
[44:45] he said, "I will make him a helpmate."
[44:48] But it's not good for the man to be
[44:52] alone. In other words, it's not good for
[44:56] a man to be apart, just apart. It's
[45:01] alone was It's not good for the
[45:03] separation.
[45:05] It's not good being alone. It's not good
[45:08] to be just a part. It's not good to be
[45:10] by itself.
[45:12] And coming from another word, I won't
[45:14] bother giving you these words, the
[45:16] Hebrew words. It's not good to withdraw.
[45:19] It's not good to be separate. It's not
[45:22] good to be isolated. And God was
[45:25] speaking something out of his own mind.
[45:30] &gt;&gt; He was expressing something. And so he
[45:33] says, "I I'll make him a helpmate."
[45:37] And from that branch, from that rib,
[45:40] from that part which he took from Adam,
[45:42] I'll make him a help meat. And from that
[45:45] branch came the fruit of his own body.
[45:48] The fruit of his own body came out out
[45:50] on that branch called Eve. And now they
[45:54] had a family.
[45:58] God was saying it's not good that he be
[46:00] alone. Because when God said that, he
[46:02] had other members. He had another
[46:05] structure in his mind.
[46:10] &gt;&gt; When God saved you, he had another
[46:13] structure in his mind than just seeing
[46:15] you as an isolated person, a single part
[46:20] by itself. And I'm not talking about I'm
[46:22] not talking about the human relationship
[46:24] so much at this point.
[46:28] And so he said to Adam that you will
[46:33] multiply
[46:36] and increase.
[46:39] You will multiply.
[46:41] You'll become great. You'll become many.
[46:46] You'll become numerous.
[46:49] You will increase greatly.
[46:52] Because when God made them, let us make
[46:55] man in our image
[46:58] and in the image of God made him and he
[47:01] was a single unit.
[47:03] And then God looking that single unit
[47:06] describing out of his own what his own
[47:09] thoughts were. It's not good for the man
[47:12] to be alone. It's not good for him to
[47:15] just be apart. There's something else
[47:18] that must be added. There's something
[47:21] else that must come forth from him. He's
[47:24] a he's a god of the earth and the god of
[47:27] the universe was expressing him himself.
[47:32] And so he he's going to multiply.
[47:37] He's going to increase. As we said
[47:41] uh concerning
[47:43] a nation as a swarm won't be one but
[47:48] will be many.
[47:50] become many. And so when God spoke of uh
[47:54] multiplying,
[47:56] he did not have in his mind kind of just
[47:59] some loose mass of humanity drifting
[48:04] about aimlessly.
[48:06] &gt;&gt; You understand? He had God had a
[48:09] structure in his mind. He had something
[48:12] in his mind. And so out of that
[48:14] structure then started to come
[48:17] individuals. But the individuals were
[48:19] were knit. They were tied together. They
[48:21] were tied together by by a family unit.
[48:26] And then the family units there another
[48:29] family that expanded it became an
[48:31] extended family. And that became tribes
[48:34] or clans.
[48:35] And then the tribes as they got larger,
[48:39] that's where the cities and towns or
[48:41] villages, that's where they began, they
[48:44] begin to, you know, trade with one
[48:45] another, etc., etc. But there were
[48:47] groups and then they became identifiable
[48:50] as they this one came from this lineage
[48:52] that one came from another lineage and
[48:54] so on. But God had in his mind that they
[48:57] would uh that they would be uh
[49:00] increasing into a certain structure.
[49:05] Now
[49:08] we could say
[49:10] and I'm going to keep using this phrase.
[49:12] It's not good for man to be alone.
[49:16] Then God calls one man, Abram.
[49:21] He calls Abram.
[49:23] And when he called him, he had something
[49:27] further in his mind than just Abram.
[49:30] When he called him, even already it was
[49:33] in God's mind, it's not good for this
[49:35] man to be alone.
[49:37] &gt;&gt; In other words, the man is only a part.
[49:41] He's not a complete unit.
[49:43] &gt;&gt; He had Sarah, his wife, but still it it
[49:47] it he So I'm not talking about that. I'm
[49:49] not talking about that union. Not
[49:51] talking about marriage. Not talking
[49:52] about man and his wife. I'm talking
[49:54] about man as God saw him. He's not
[49:57] complete.
[49:58] &gt;&gt; And so he said, "I'm going to give you a
[50:00] son."
[50:03] And still that's not the complete
[50:05] thought in the mind of God. He said,
[50:07] "And I'm going to make you a father of
[50:10] nations.
[50:11] &gt;&gt; You're going to be a part and out of you
[50:13] is going to come kings." In in the mind
[50:16] of God, he had a structure. There's
[50:19] going to be nations come out of you.
[50:20] There's going to be kings come out of
[50:22] you. You're going to be connected.
[50:25] &gt;&gt; You're going to be connected on uh uh on
[50:28] a larger scale. I'm going to connect you
[50:32] because God is actually expressing
[50:34] something spiritual. Now, in the
[50:36] spiritual realm,
[50:39] in other words, he could be saying to
[50:42] him, "It's not good that you're alone.
[50:46] What What needs to happen?" He could
[50:48] have said it to out of out from Isaac
[50:51] came Jacob.
[50:53] And out of Jacob came the patriarchs.
[50:57] He could have said to Jacob, "It's not
[50:59] good that you're alone." Because God was
[51:03] building a nation. He was building a
[51:07] group of people. It's not good that
[51:10] you're alone. So, here comes forth
[51:13] Reuben, and here comes forth Gad, and
[51:15] here comes forth uh all of the all of
[51:19] the 12 patriarchs coming out of Jacob
[51:24] because this was a foundation,
[51:28] you see. So he could have he could have
[51:31] been saying to Abram Abraham also
[51:35] it's not good that you're alone. You've
[51:38] got to be connected in another way.
[51:41] You've got to be connected as a
[51:42] foundation stone
[51:45] for a whole redemptive plan
[51:48] because you are a part of that. But in
[51:51] order to be a part you got to be
[51:53] connected to another part.
[51:56] You must be connected.
[51:58] And this was ordained of God.
[52:03] Isaac and Jacob and Joseph, they all
[52:06] must be apart. And then out from the
[52:09] patriarchs. Well, of course, there's,
[52:12] you know, we don't want to even begin to
[52:14] try to get into their history. There
[52:15] were good people, bad people, all the
[52:17] rest of it. But God had something in his
[52:19] mind and he's moving forward to that
[52:22] ultimate objective
[52:25] and he's structuring and bringing forth.
[52:27] And finally, he he tells Abraham, "Your
[52:30] people are going to be in bondage. I'm
[52:33] they're going to be in bondage for 400
[52:34] years, and after 400 years, I'm going to
[52:37] bring them out with a mighty hand." And
[52:39] now he brings his people out. And uh and
[52:42] now he begins to he begins to identify
[52:45] them as something different. It's not
[52:48] just a a single man now. It's not just
[52:50] Abraham, one man. Now he's dealing with
[52:53] a whole group of people. And he changed
[52:56] he changed Jacob's name from Jacob to
[52:58] Israel because he prevailed in a
[53:01] wrestling with the angel. And he said,
[53:03] "I'm going to call you Israel because
[53:06] you you prevailed and Israel is to
[53:10] prevail.
[53:12] You're prevailing." And all of these uh
[53:15] were I identifying the the group of
[53:19] people. And now these people aren't
[53:22] called the children of Jacob. They're
[53:24] called the children of Israel. So there
[53:26] come a time when he called them, you're
[53:29] the children of Israel now because I've
[53:31] structured this to an advanced stage
[53:35] and you will be to me a people. You'll
[53:38] be a kingdom, a holy kingdom. You'll be
[53:41] a nation of priests to me. You'll be if
[53:45] you follow this word, this is what
[53:47] you're going to be. If you follow my
[53:48] covenant, if you live according to my
[53:50] word, you're going to you're going to
[53:52] become something else.
[53:54] &gt;&gt; You're not just going to be remain uh uh
[53:57] you know, as a loosely knit group of
[53:59] people of a nation of the earth. You're
[54:01] going to be something else. In other
[54:02] word, you're going to be a congregation.
[54:04] You're going to be a testimony unto me.
[54:07] and and regardless and when he said that
[54:09] he and he called them the children of
[54:11] the children of Israel and he called
[54:13] them the congregation
[54:15] the congregation of Israel because he
[54:17] was now declaring there's this has come
[54:19] to another stage you're going to be a
[54:21] testimony you're going to be a witness
[54:23] I'm not asking you if you want to be I'm
[54:25] telling you you're going to be because
[54:27] I've called you this
[54:28] &gt;&gt; I've given you this name I've given you
[54:30] this title because you now you have been
[54:33] de you're developed to another state
[54:36] Amen.
[54:37] &gt;&gt; This wasn't by their choosing. They
[54:40] didn't fall on their face and pray that
[54:41] they could be this kind of a testimony.
[54:44] God said, "You're going to be this
[54:45] testimony." And he was saying, "You're
[54:48] going to say it again and again and
[54:50] again. You're going to be a glory to the
[54:53] to to to the God of Israel."
[54:57] &gt;&gt; And they failed God. And they went into
[54:59] bondage and they sinned and they had
[55:01] other idols and all the rest of it. But
[55:03] God did not forsake them. He always
[55:06] brought them back because he told them,
[55:09] "You will be the congregation.
[55:12] &gt;&gt; You will be the witness.
[55:13] &gt;&gt; You will be the testimony under my
[55:16] name." Even though they disgraced the
[55:18] name, he would not abandon them as their
[55:20] as his f as their father. I am your
[55:24] father
[55:26] &gt;&gt; and they were his family.
[55:28] &gt;&gt; But the family had developed to another
[55:31] state.
[55:33] And God is saying all the way along, if
[55:35] you can catch my thought, God is saying
[55:38] it's not good for man to be alone.
[55:40] &gt;&gt; I've got to have a family.
[55:42] &gt;&gt; And more than a family, I've got to have
[55:44] a family that's a witness. I've got to
[55:46] have a family that testifies of who I
[55:48] am.
[55:49] &gt;&gt; I've got to have a congregation that
[55:52] will be a witness unto me.
[55:54] &gt;&gt; And I'm going to have that. That's what
[55:56] God was saying.
[55:57] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[56:01] Just speaking on a human level,
[56:05] brother Brandham in the message of law
[56:06] or grace, he just made the statement. He
[56:10] said, "I die freely for my children and
[56:14] any other father would."
[56:17] That's a tremendous sign.
[56:20] You got your children beside you
[56:22] tonight. The prophet of God said, "I
[56:24] would die freely for my children." And
[56:26] he was talking about when the children
[56:29] of Israel were calling for the blood of
[56:33] Jesus Christ. Said they were actually
[56:35] calling for the blood of their own
[56:37] father.
[56:39] &gt;&gt; And he did. He freely died for his own
[56:41] children. Amen.
[56:47] &gt;&gt; Now, as time moves on
[56:50] and as natural parents,
[56:54] we will never know those that come out
[56:57] from us.
[57:00] You might have and I can tell you that
[57:03] you know you have children in the
[57:05] natural lineage. have children and then
[57:08] you have grandchildren
[57:11] and such as we're experiencing now and
[57:13] then you have great grandchildren
[57:15] and if you live long enough you'd have
[57:17] great great grandchildren
[57:19] but you but but the the
[57:23] uh the the little circle when we were
[57:26] five in the home and we're always at the
[57:30] table and always exchanging all the
[57:32] activities of the day and all the things
[57:34] that were taking place. That was
[57:36] morning, noon, and night. You're always
[57:37] having that. Well, then there comes a
[57:39] time when that doesn't happen anymore.
[57:42] &gt;&gt; All the events are happening at other
[57:43] tables and you're sitting there looking
[57:46] at each other and hope you have
[57:48] something constructive to say.
[57:55] Sometime you have to invent something
[57:59] and then finally you know it goes
[58:01] further apart and drifts a little bit
[58:03] further because the thing is uh it it's
[58:07] it's you know the what shall I say the
[58:11] orbit it's it's becoming more I won't
[58:14] say elliptical but it's just it's
[58:16] spreading out you know the little sphere
[58:18] is spreading out and we used to have the
[58:21] grandchildren around all the time but
[58:24] but finally you They grew up and they
[58:26] have their own family so they don't come
[58:27] around so often and it just spreads out
[58:31] a little bit further and you find that
[58:32] now each of them you know they're occupi
[58:35] occupied with their own little circle
[58:37] their own little cycle and you realize
[58:40] one day you're not going to you know
[58:42] have that kind of intimate relationship
[58:45] because everybody's busy, everybody's
[58:48] occupied and the and the sphere is just
[58:50] spreading out and getting further and
[58:52] further and then of course you know one
[58:54] today uh according just to the natural
[58:57] uh turn of events, you you drop over
[59:00] into the into the grave and uh you don't
[59:03] know who comes on.
[59:09] You'll come Sunday morning to hear the
[59:11] rest of it, won't you?
[59:15] God. Now, Chronicles
[59:17] uh 17, 1st Chronicles 17 in the seals.
[59:21] This is where brother Brandham takes
[59:23] this for the dedication.
[59:26] But listen now. Now therefore, thus
[59:29] shalt thou say unto my servant David,
[59:31] God sending the prophet Nathan to him,
[59:34] thus sayith the Lord of hosts, I took
[59:37] thee, one person, I took you from the
[59:41] sheep coat,
[59:43] even from following the sheep. You're
[59:45] just a little strippling following the
[59:47] sheep. that thou shouldest be a ruler
[59:50] over my people.
[59:52] And I have been with thee whethersoever
[59:55] thou hast walked. And I have cut off all
[59:58] thine enemies from before thee, and have
[1:00:00] made thee a name like the name of great
[1:00:04] men that are in the earth.
[1:00:07] Also, I will I will ordain a place for
[1:00:10] my people, Israel. He's saying, I'm I I
[1:00:14] picked you out of the sheep coat. I just
[1:00:16] took you when you're a young fellow,
[1:00:18] just a strippling, and you were just
[1:00:19] following the sheep. But that's not what
[1:00:21] God had in his mind. What he had in his
[1:00:23] mind, I'm going to I want you to have a
[1:00:25] position over my people,
[1:00:28] over this group of people,
[1:00:32] and I will ordain a place for my people
[1:00:36] Israel, and I will plant them, and they
[1:00:39] shall dwell in their plural place, and
[1:00:42] shall be moved no more. Neither shall
[1:00:45] the children of the wickedness waste
[1:00:47] them anymore as at the beginning. And
[1:00:50] since the time that I commanded judges
[1:00:53] to be over my people Israel, moreover, I
[1:00:56] will subdue all thine enemies.
[1:00:58] Furthermore, I tell thee that the Lord
[1:01:02] will build thee a house. David wanted to
[1:01:05] build a house for the Lord. So, I'm
[1:01:06] going to build you a house. Now, listen
[1:01:09] to this next verse. And it shall come to
[1:01:11] pass when thy days are expired,
[1:01:16] when your days come up and you're gone,
[1:01:19] that thou must go to be with thy
[1:01:22] fathers, that I will raise up thy seed.
[1:01:25] Now, he's telling them, when you're
[1:01:26] gone, you won't know anything about
[1:01:29] this, but I'm going to raise up your
[1:01:31] seed after you, and which shall be of
[1:01:34] thy sons, and I will establish his
[1:01:38] kingdom. So, he's enlightening David
[1:01:40] after you're gone. Otherwise, David
[1:01:43] wouldn't know anything about it.
[1:01:45] &gt;&gt; The day would come, you might want to
[1:01:47] know what's going to happen with this
[1:01:49] message. Well, if time would go on, you
[1:01:51] know, we'll all uh uh we'll all find our
[1:01:54] place some some some we're looking for a
[1:01:57] rapture, but I'm just talking about as
[1:01:58] it was as it has been in recorded in
[1:02:01] time. We'd all find our place in some
[1:02:03] cemetery, and we wouldn't know what's
[1:02:05] going on. What happened to that church?
[1:02:07] What happened to this group of what
[1:02:09] happened to my family? Where are they?
[1:02:11] We wouldn't know anything about it. And
[1:02:13] he's telling David, you and your days
[1:02:15] are expired and you're gone, but I'm
[1:02:18] going to raise up, he's telling them,
[1:02:20] he's giving him some insight. I'm going
[1:02:21] to raise up your sons
[1:02:24] and I will establish his kingdom and he
[1:02:27] shall build me a house. In other words,
[1:02:29] what I wouldn't let you to do, he's
[1:02:31] going to build me a house and I will
[1:02:33] establish his throne forever.
[1:02:38] Job he said
[1:02:42] of him of his life. He said his sons
[1:02:45] come to honor and he knoweth it not.
[1:02:49] His sons they they they make a mark in
[1:02:52] the world but he doesn't know anything.
[1:02:54] I won't know anything about it.
[1:02:57] And they are they are brought low but he
[1:03:00] perceiveth it not of them. there. Some
[1:03:04] of them are raised to honor and others
[1:03:05] are become low, some succeed, some fail.
[1:03:09] But he doesn't know anything about it
[1:03:11] because he's gone. He's expired. So an
[1:03:14] earthly father, as an earthly father,
[1:03:16] they were conscious that they didn't
[1:03:18] they they they were not aware of
[1:03:21] everything that was taking place. But
[1:03:23] that is not God.
[1:03:25] &gt;&gt; God is conscious of everything that
[1:03:28] shall unfold as time goes on. Amen.
[1:03:32] &gt;&gt; And God is not complete without this
[1:03:35] continual unfolding. I want you to know
[1:03:38] that this is not some accidental thing
[1:03:41] that's taking place. God is actually I
[1:03:46] keep using this phrase. God would not be
[1:03:49] complete
[1:03:51] unless this thing continued to unfold.
[1:03:54] Unless there was one thing added to
[1:03:57] another, one spiritual experience added
[1:04:01] to another, God's not complete without
[1:04:03] it.
[1:04:04] &gt;&gt; Because when God said man shall not be
[1:04:07] alone, it's not good for him to just be
[1:04:09] apart. It's not good for him to be
[1:04:11] isolated. It's not good. In other words,
[1:04:13] there must be things that are added and
[1:04:16] added and added for the man to be
[1:04:18] complete.
[1:04:19] &gt;&gt; And I'll give him a help meat. And out
[1:04:21] of the help meat came a a son and came
[1:04:25] daughters. And out of that came a
[1:04:27] family. And from that came tribes. And
[1:04:29] from that they became clans. And from
[1:04:31] that came nations. And then he selected
[1:04:34] one of the nations. And because now you
[1:04:36] will be my people. This all been in the
[1:04:39] mind of God. God was saying it's not
[1:04:41] good for me. And even when he had Adam,
[1:04:44] he still was. It's not good to be alone.
[1:04:46] Adam's got to have something else. So he
[1:04:48] made Eve. And even when he had Eve, it's
[1:04:50] not good for me to be the way I am. I'm
[1:04:53] still isolated. I'm still incomplete. I
[1:04:55] still haven't got what I got in my mind.
[1:04:58] I have attributes in my mind. I've got
[1:05:01] thoughts in my mind. And it's not good
[1:05:03] if I don't have everything that
[1:05:06] fulfilled the way I have it pictured in
[1:05:08] my mind.
[1:05:09] &gt;&gt; And out of them came a nation. And God
[1:05:12] still out of that nation. It's not good
[1:05:14] for me to be alone. This nation has to
[1:05:16] be a special kind of a nation. This
[1:05:18] people have to be led by a prophet and
[1:05:20] he gets a prophet and he's still feeling
[1:05:23] incomplete. He's still feeling it's not
[1:05:25] it's not fulfilled yet.
[1:05:28] &gt;&gt; This people have to be a testimony.
[1:05:30] &gt;&gt; And so when he finally comes to the
[1:05:32] shedding of the blood, he said, "Now
[1:05:34] I'll call you the congregation of
[1:05:36] Israel."
[1:05:37] &gt;&gt; This is taking a different color. This
[1:05:39] is taking a different a different facet.
[1:05:42] This is going to be something different.
[1:05:44] Now, I'm going to call you a
[1:05:45] congregation of Israel cuz there's going
[1:05:47] to be blood shed and you'll be a
[1:05:50] witness. You'll be a nation that'll be
[1:05:53] identified with blood. You'll be a
[1:05:56] nation identified with sacrifice. You're
[1:05:58] going to be something different than you
[1:06:00] have been.
[1:06:02] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:06:08] &gt;&gt; Brother Brandon says in the beginning,
[1:06:12] what a message. What a messenger we
[1:06:15] have. In the beginning
[1:06:18] that God dwelt alone with his thoughts,
[1:06:22] with his attributes.
[1:06:24] Listen closely now.
[1:06:28] He was in the beginning
[1:06:31] by himself.
[1:06:33] It's not good that man should be alone.
[1:06:38] He was by himself. God dwelt alone with
[1:06:42] his thoughts, but it's not good
[1:06:46] &gt;&gt; for him just to be a part. You say,
[1:06:49] "Well, he was he he he was God almighty.
[1:06:51] He's absolutely complete." I can tell
[1:06:53] you that God wouldn't have even
[1:06:55] commenced a creation if he was complete.
[1:06:59] &gt;&gt; It took something further. I can't
[1:07:01] comprehend how an eternal God could take
[1:07:03] 6,000 6,000 years isn't even a hiccup.
[1:07:08] I don't understand how the eternal God
[1:07:10] what was happening for the other
[1:07:11] billions and billions and billions of
[1:07:13] years because he had no beginning and no
[1:07:15] end.
[1:07:16] &gt;&gt; I I can't grasp that. But the but but
[1:07:19] but somehow God began he began to uh
[1:07:23] commence something and out of his mind
[1:07:26] he was alone. Prophet said he was alone
[1:07:29] with his thoughts and he brings forth
[1:07:31] one like him and he he this one that's
[1:07:34] like him and God says it's not good for
[1:07:37] you to be alone.
[1:07:38] &gt;&gt; Something has to come out. Something has
[1:07:40] to come forth from you. Hallelujah.
[1:07:43] &gt;&gt; You must bring something forth. And I
[1:07:46] and and so I have to give you a
[1:07:47] helpmate. You've got to have a womb for
[1:07:49] your seed. And something has to come
[1:07:51] forth. And out of that womb will come a
[1:07:54] branch. Branches uh will spread out and
[1:07:57] you'll have a family and it'll be a
[1:07:59] unit. This is my son. This is my
[1:08:01] daughter. This is my family. They sit at
[1:08:04] my table. These are mine. I'll let give
[1:08:07] my life for them as the prophet said.
[1:08:08] I'd run out in the yard and die for them
[1:08:10] in an instant. They're mine. They cut
[1:08:13] fruit of my body.
[1:08:16] &gt;&gt; See? And then they move out. And then
[1:08:18] they're united to their own. And then it
[1:08:20] moves out and the circle gets larger.
[1:08:23] But and for us as poor humans, we we we
[1:08:26] would like to be able to see. And Job
[1:08:28] says, "Ah,
[1:08:31] man's his sons rise up
[1:08:35] and he doesn't know anything about it.
[1:08:38] He's he's melancholy. He's sad that he
[1:08:41] has to leave. Man dies
[1:08:44] and he's gone.
[1:08:47] and his sons become great people. He
[1:08:50] doesn't know anything about it. Others
[1:08:52] fail
[1:08:54] and are a failure. He doesn't know
[1:08:56] anything about it. He's gone.
[1:09:00] God realized that. So he says to David,
[1:09:03] "You're going to expire. Your days are
[1:09:05] going to end, but after you're gone,
[1:09:09] your sons will raise up." And out of
[1:09:11] them, he he didn't just say they're
[1:09:13] going to be a basket case. He didn't
[1:09:16] just say they're going to be some loose
[1:09:17] knit of wanders or nomads over here on
[1:09:20] the hills. He says, "No, they're going
[1:09:22] to I'm going to raise them up and
[1:09:24] there's going to be a kingdom
[1:09:26] &gt;&gt; and I'm going to establish a kingdom."
[1:09:28] He's telling his friend, "I'm going to
[1:09:30] establish a kingdom and that kingdom is
[1:09:32] going to be forever."
[1:09:35] &gt;&gt; And furthermore, you want to build a
[1:09:37] house. I won't let you build a house,
[1:09:38] but your son is going to build me a
[1:09:40] house. And oh, and there he is in life
[1:09:42] realizing my son is going to build God a
[1:09:45] house.
[1:09:46] &gt;&gt; Glory to God.
[1:09:46] &gt;&gt; God told me so.
[1:09:48] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:09:51] &gt;&gt; What is God expressing?
[1:09:54] It's not good to be alone. There has to
[1:09:56] be another part. He doesn't just want a
[1:09:58] family. He wants a family becomes a
[1:10:01] nation. He doesn't just want a nation.
[1:10:03] He says it's going to be a holy nation.
[1:10:06] &gt;&gt; This isn't going to be just a people.
[1:10:07] It's going to be a peculiar people.
[1:10:09] because that's what I got in my mind.
[1:10:11] It's not good for me to be alone. I got
[1:10:14] to have a holy people. I got to have a
[1:10:16] peculiar people. And furthermore, oh,
[1:10:19] this people is going to be they're going
[1:10:22] to be a congregation. They're going to
[1:10:24] be a testimony. They're going to be a
[1:10:26] witness unto me. And they're going to
[1:10:28] say the same thing from one generation
[1:10:30] to the next to the next. It'll be
[1:10:32] unchanging because I'm unchanging.
[1:10:34] They're going to be unchanging. Amen.
[1:10:37] &gt;&gt; Not good for me to be alone. That's what
[1:10:39] I have in my mind. It has to it has to
[1:10:42] come to fruition.
[1:10:43] &gt;&gt; Are you following me now?
[1:10:48] &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham said he was alone.
[1:10:51] He said, listen to this very closely.
[1:10:57] I tell you what is a staggering
[1:10:59] statement.
[1:11:02] When you try to put this in perspective
[1:11:04] with eternity that has no beginning and
[1:11:07] no end.
[1:11:10] He was in the beginning by himself.
[1:11:13] God dwelt alone with his thoughts.
[1:11:16] You've heard it before. Hang tight.
[1:11:19] He'll never do that again.
[1:11:23] &gt;&gt; He'll never do that again. He can never
[1:11:27] be alone again. Never be alone again.
[1:11:30] one man standing here on earth, a little
[1:11:33] human being, a little Kuckian with only
[1:11:37] a a seventh grade education, but the
[1:11:39] mind of God flowing through that vessel
[1:11:42] and being able to peer into the eternity
[1:11:45] and say he was alone with the son, but
[1:11:47] he'll never be alone again.
[1:11:51] &gt;&gt; He was alone. He'll never be alone
[1:11:53] again. Why? One of the reasons is
[1:11:56] because you're here
[1:11:58] &gt;&gt; because his thoughts are being
[1:12:00] manifested.
[1:12:01] &gt;&gt; And you know why you're here? Because he
[1:12:04] said, "It's not good for man. It's not
[1:12:06] good for me to be alone."
[1:12:08] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:12:11] &gt;&gt; And had he been completely fulfilled, he
[1:12:14] without this generation, then he'd have
[1:12:16] shut things off before now. But he he
[1:12:18] couldn't be fulfilled until you came
[1:12:20] along. Amen.
[1:12:22] &gt;&gt; And now today I bring it down this
[1:12:24] evening down to a simple truth. He he
[1:12:27] could not be complete without each
[1:12:30] elected child of his. He said it's not
[1:12:33] good for me to be alone. In other words,
[1:12:36] it's not good for me just to be a part.
[1:12:38] And if there's a part missing,
[1:12:41] &gt;&gt; then he cannot be fulfilled. And if you
[1:12:43] are a part, he had to have you. He has
[1:12:46] to have you as a part.
[1:12:49] That's right.
[1:12:51] &gt;&gt; How could he be God and say, "But
[1:12:54] there's a part missing.
[1:12:56] There's a part I had. I had a thought. I
[1:12:59] had an attribute in my mind.
[1:13:03] Oh, there's a certain
[1:13:06] just had a certain sound.
[1:13:09] If just a certain something,
[1:13:14] but I had it in my thoughts. He couldn't
[1:13:17] be complete
[1:13:18] unless that came on the scene.
[1:13:23] He said he'll never be that again
[1:13:26] because his thoughts are being made
[1:13:28] manifest.
[1:13:30] Listen, please listen closely. He'll
[1:13:33] never be alone again because his
[1:13:36] thoughts are being made manifest. And
[1:13:38] that's why we are right here this day.
[1:13:46] Amen.
[1:13:48] &gt;&gt; You didn't come
[1:13:51] just to fill.
[1:13:52] &gt;&gt; In fact, as I'll say, whatever place
[1:13:55] you're filling in this earthly life is
[1:13:57] very, very minuscule. That's just to
[1:14:00] give you bread to eat and a place to lay
[1:14:03] your head. But that doesn't got a whole
[1:14:06] lot of importance with God. That's why
[1:14:08] Jesus said, "Take no thought of these
[1:14:09] things.
[1:14:12] &gt;&gt; Take no thought of them.
[1:14:14] It's relatively insignificant. It
[1:14:17] doesn't make a whole lot of difference
[1:14:18] with God.
[1:14:21] But you came you came to be a testimony
[1:14:25] to be a witness of the same thing. And
[1:14:27] so it had to be the same. It had to be
[1:14:30] blood.
[1:14:32] &gt;&gt; They came by blood. That first
[1:14:34] congregation came by blood. This one has
[1:14:36] to come by blood. Each individual, each
[1:14:39] man had to have a lamb for his own
[1:14:41] household. I have to have the blood.
[1:14:45] &gt;&gt; Oh my.
[1:14:47] &gt;&gt; I hope you're catching what I'm saying.
[1:14:53] &gt;&gt; I have to come and I have to manifest. I
[1:14:56] am giving testimony that God will never
[1:15:00] ever be alone again because I'm part of
[1:15:04] those manifested thoughts.
[1:15:06] If you believe that you are have been
[1:15:09] purchased by the blood of God through
[1:15:12] Jesus Christ and been sealed by the Holy
[1:15:15] Spirit, then you're standing or sitting
[1:15:17] here tonight as a testimony that I'm
[1:15:19] here to manifest that God shall never be
[1:15:22] alone again.
[1:15:26] &gt;&gt; But now you're not just a a single unit.
[1:15:31] And this will take on new meaning right
[1:15:33] now. I'd like to I'd like to have saved
[1:15:35] it, but I'll just I'll just touch on it.
[1:15:37] That's what brother Brandham said when
[1:15:40] Israel was called out. Then they became
[1:15:43] church because ecclesia is called out.
[1:15:46] Now he he if he just called out say
[1:15:50] Jonathan here called out John, he
[1:15:53] couldn't call him church because a
[1:15:56] church is many membered
[1:15:59] body.
[1:16:01] So he couldn't say ecclesia
[1:16:03] for just one. So he called Abram, called
[1:16:06] him out. But that wasn't just what was
[1:16:09] in God's mind. So God stayed with him.
[1:16:11] God worked with him. God encouraged him.
[1:16:14] God gave covenant to him. God confirmed
[1:16:16] the covenant. God kept on. Why? Because
[1:16:18] he's he's expressing what's in himself.
[1:16:21] It's not good that I'll be alone. He's
[1:16:23] going to give him a wife. She's going to
[1:16:24] doubt they're going to have Hagar. Going
[1:16:26] to have that can't change the plan.
[1:16:28] Still got to have a son. going to have a
[1:16:30] son by this woman. One year, two years,
[1:16:32] 25 years, here comes a son. That's not
[1:16:35] enough because God is incomplete. God
[1:16:37] just apart. That son has to have another
[1:16:39] son. Have to have another son. And then
[1:16:42] Jacob comes. He's got to have 12 because
[1:16:44] there got to be a foundation.
[1:16:46] Hallelujah. Got to be a foundation. Cuz
[1:16:48] in God's mind, I got a people in my
[1:16:50] mind. I got a nation in my mind. And
[1:16:52] then they're going to come and call them
[1:16:54] a a congregation of Israel. Now I change
[1:16:56] your name. It's not gonna be Jacob. I'm
[1:16:58] going to call you Israel. Out of you is
[1:17:00] going to come bunch of children. So one
[1:17:02] day in his mind, I'm going to call them
[1:17:03] the children of Israel. I'm going to
[1:17:05] call them that. At the very night,
[1:17:07] they're going to shed blood cuz they're
[1:17:09] going to be a testimony unto me.
[1:17:12] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Going to be a specific type
[1:17:14] of people. They're going to be a
[1:17:16] bloodbought people.
[1:17:20] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:17:21] &gt;&gt; And I'm going to purchase them at the
[1:17:22] expense of death coming on the land. I'm
[1:17:25] going to destroy Egypt. I'm going to
[1:17:27] bring Egypt to dust and ashes for this
[1:17:30] people called the children of Israel.
[1:17:35] &gt;&gt; Now I have a prophet
[1:17:37] prophet coming this generation revealing
[1:17:40] the son of man Jesus Christ. He says
[1:17:44] I'll not call you church anymore.
[1:17:47] &gt;&gt; You're not just an ecclesia. You're not
[1:17:50] just called out of all these
[1:17:51] denominations. But now we've come to
[1:17:53] another stage. I'm going to call you
[1:17:55] bride.
[1:17:59] I'm going to give you a different
[1:18:01] signification. I'm going to give you a
[1:18:03] different identification. I've heard a
[1:18:05] lot of people just use that just
[1:18:06] loosely. I'm not going to call you
[1:18:08] church anymore. I'm going to call you
[1:18:09] bride. And that's that's about all it
[1:18:11] means, I guess. But now God is saying
[1:18:14] something different. This group of
[1:18:16] people I had in my mind even on the day
[1:18:19] of Pentecost, there was a group of
[1:18:21] people they were they were separated and
[1:18:24] they became sealed and filled with the
[1:18:26] Holy Spirit. And the and the church now
[1:18:28] became birthed as a church. And Jesus
[1:18:31] said upon this rock of revelation, I'll
[1:18:34] build my church.
[1:18:36] &gt;&gt; I'm going to build out build the
[1:18:38] ecclesia. I'm going to build them.
[1:18:40] &gt;&gt; And so he be to build them. But it
[1:18:42] wasn't enough out of the first church
[1:18:44] age messenger or the second as it begin
[1:18:47] to take shape and as they suffered as
[1:18:49] the 68 million were saying as martyrs.
[1:18:52] What is it God is saying in his mind?
[1:18:55] Oh, but it's not enough. It's not
[1:18:57] everything I have in my mind. It this
[1:18:59] can't come to a conclusion yet. This is
[1:19:02] a great event, but it can't come to an
[1:19:04] end yet. I have more in my mind. I have
[1:19:06] more attributes. I have more thoughts.
[1:19:08] I've got something else in my mind.
[1:19:12] I'm still only just apart.
[1:19:14] &gt;&gt; I feel isolated without them.
[1:19:17] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:19:17] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:19:19] &gt;&gt; And in the last messenger come, I hope
[1:19:21] you get me. And here come a prophet
[1:19:23] voice. It's a voice of God to the
[1:19:26] people. And he's trying to say to a deaf
[1:19:28] people, I would say a dumb people, a
[1:19:30] blind people. He's trying to call them
[1:19:32] out.
[1:19:34] And he shows and manifests the very the
[1:19:36] very nature of God, the very humility of
[1:19:39] Jesus Christ, the very power of God and
[1:19:42] the very life of God, resurrecting the
[1:19:45] dead, and all manner of things as a sign
[1:19:48] to the people. But eyes they have and
[1:19:50] they see not, ears they have and they
[1:19:52] hear not. And he comes to a blind lay to
[1:19:56] see a generation. My brother, my sister,
[1:19:58] I hope you're understanding me. But God
[1:20:01] is screaming out even in this day, it's
[1:20:03] not good for man to be alone.
[1:20:06] I've had a Pentecost. I've had a
[1:20:09] reformation. I've had 68 million
[1:20:12] martyrs. I've had tremendous sacrifice.
[1:20:14] But it's not good for man to be alone.
[1:20:17] There must come a different
[1:20:18] signification. There must come a
[1:20:20] different a different level. There must
[1:20:23] come a bride out of this thing.
[1:20:26] And let me tell you, my brother, my
[1:20:28] sister, the authority of God's word, out
[1:20:30] of this mess of Leodysia, God's going to
[1:20:32] have a spotless bride.
[1:20:36] &gt;&gt; He said it and he's the one who's
[1:20:38] obligated to do it. It has nothing to do
[1:20:41] whether you and I can achieve it. He's
[1:20:43] going to achieve it.
[1:20:47] &gt;&gt; That bride comes walking down, she's not
[1:20:49] going to say, "Well, bless God. I sure
[1:20:50] worked hard to get get here where I'm
[1:20:53] at." You're going to say it's grace.
[1:20:56] &gt;&gt; He's the one who's worthy. You could do
[1:20:59] nothing for it. He said it.
[1:21:02] &gt;&gt; You could do no more for it.
[1:21:04] &gt;&gt; Then Eve had to do when she walked up to
[1:21:07] Adam. She could say, "Boy, was that ever
[1:21:10] an achievement.
[1:21:12] She didn't have a thing to do with it.
[1:21:15] God made her. God created her. And and
[1:21:18] God gave her part of her husband's body
[1:21:21] and his spirit. And the Bible says he
[1:21:24] brought the woman to the man.
[1:21:30] &gt;&gt; She could not say, "I'm glad I had this
[1:21:32] idea.
[1:21:34] &gt;&gt; I'm glad I came. I'm glad I accepted
[1:21:36] Adam."
[1:21:38] &gt;&gt; She had nothing to do with accepting
[1:21:40] Adam.
[1:21:41] &gt;&gt; I mean, her author, her maker, her
[1:21:44] creator brought her to him
[1:21:48] &gt;&gt; because he's the one who said it's not
[1:21:50] good for him to be alone. It isn't what
[1:21:53] you did. It's what he has already done.
[1:21:55] It isn't what what you promised. It's
[1:21:57] according to his covenant.
[1:22:00] &gt;&gt; And you came because God said you must
[1:22:03] come.
[1:22:04] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. You came because he said
[1:22:06] it's not good for man to be alone.
[1:22:08] Expressing something out of his own
[1:22:10] bosom,
[1:22:11] out of his own soul,
[1:22:14] out of his own being.
[1:22:19] I'll tell you what, if you think for a
[1:22:21] minute
[1:22:23] that God is just so complete, he doesn't
[1:22:25] need another thing, then for sure you
[1:22:27] and I are destined for hell.
[1:22:31] Because what would we be? We we we we we
[1:22:34] would be an obstacle in heaven
[1:22:38] if God had never thought of us and we
[1:22:40] appear there. He says, "Who are you?
[1:22:44] &gt;&gt; What are you doing here?
[1:22:47] No say
[1:22:49] by his that's why brother Brandham said
[1:22:52] if you hear someone singing over there
[1:22:54] he'll be singing Amazing Grace.
[1:22:57] &gt;&gt; How sweet the sound that saved a wretch
[1:22:59] like me.
[1:23:00] &gt;&gt; Once I was lost and now I'm found.
[1:23:03] Hallelujah. Once I was blind but now I
[1:23:05] see. That's grace. Grace. Grace
[1:23:09] &gt;&gt; and only grace.
[1:23:14] Children of Israel,
[1:23:16] children of the witness, children of the
[1:23:19] congregation failed miserably time and
[1:23:22] again, but God's program could never be
[1:23:25] diverted. It could not be thwarted. It
[1:23:28] could not be circumvented.
[1:23:31] I'm only telling you this because that's
[1:23:32] the truth of God's word.
[1:23:36] &gt;&gt; Just give me another few moments
[1:23:40] &gt;&gt; and questions and answers.
[1:23:43] He says the word death means separated.
[1:23:48] Now physically we separate from our
[1:23:50] physical sight because that's still sin.
[1:23:55] But our spirit is of God and that can
[1:23:58] never be separated from God because we
[1:24:00] are a part of God. I want you to notice
[1:24:03] now we are brought back into that
[1:24:07] thought of God. We're brought back into
[1:24:11] that thought of God.
[1:24:16] If we're in the program of God this
[1:24:18] evening, just now
[1:24:24] and if we feel or believe that the Holy
[1:24:27] Spirit has directed our footsteps
[1:24:30] and we walked into the sanctuary this
[1:24:32] evening because time permitted it, our
[1:24:36] jobs permitted it, whatever, but we
[1:24:38] walked into here this evening.
[1:24:43] If we are of God
[1:24:47] back in the eternities,
[1:24:50] God
[1:24:51] in his mind thought of us. Didn't just
[1:24:55] see us here. That's not sufficient. But
[1:24:57] thought of us sitting here.
[1:25:01] &gt;&gt; Thought of us.
[1:25:04] When he thought of you sitting here, he
[1:25:06] thought of me sitting where I sit. Right
[1:25:09] &gt;&gt; now I have to take this poor
[1:25:13] uh wearied mind
[1:25:15] and I have to impress it. Impress it. I
[1:25:20] have to take maybe just a short phrase.
[1:25:23] I want him to speak of me. I want the
[1:25:27] people to grasp something of my own
[1:25:30] being,
[1:25:31] something of my own craving, something
[1:25:33] of my own yearning, something of my own
[1:25:35] desire. because he said his thoughts was
[1:25:37] his desires. Brother Brandham said his
[1:25:39] thoughts was his desires. So in his
[1:25:42] thought I'll inspire him and he'll say
[1:25:49] it's not good.
[1:25:51] It's not pleasant. It's not complete
[1:25:54] that the man is by himself.
[1:25:59] He must tell them that I am incomplete
[1:26:03] without them.
[1:26:05] And that is why there will be such
[1:26:06] rejoicing
[1:26:08] and such a bursting forth of exuberance
[1:26:12] when every last one not of not of his
[1:26:14] children merely but of his thoughts come
[1:26:16] back.
[1:26:20] &gt;&gt; And we are here tonight because we've
[1:26:22] come into his thoughts. We've come into
[1:26:24] his thoughts.
[1:26:28] And because his thoughts are being
[1:26:31] manifested,
[1:26:32] that is the evidence he can say, "I'll
[1:26:35] never be alone again."
[1:26:38] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:26:39] &gt;&gt; I'll never be alone again.
[1:26:49] &gt;&gt; We are brought back into that thought of
[1:26:52] God.
[1:26:53] Everything that God does is perfect and
[1:26:57] eternal. And when God's very thoughts
[1:27:00] went out
[1:27:02] for a kingdom of people, his thoughts
[1:27:05] went out for a kingdom of people.
[1:27:09] His thought went out for a kingdom.
[1:27:13] Not because you're slow, but because I
[1:27:14] want to really am. His thought went out
[1:27:16] for a kingdom.
[1:27:18] So when the thought went out for a
[1:27:20] kingdom, he called one man,
[1:27:24] Abram,
[1:27:25] leave your kindred and come
[1:27:29] to a place that I'll show you. And a man
[1:27:31] starts. But because his thought was for
[1:27:34] a kingdom, he's still alone. Says, "This
[1:27:38] isn't what this isn't what I had in
[1:27:39] mind." In other words, I just got a a
[1:27:41] man.
[1:27:43] And but the man is going to be a father
[1:27:45] of faith. He's going to be that. I'm
[1:27:47] going to cause him to be that. I'm going
[1:27:48] to lead him. I'm going to shepherd him.
[1:27:50] Brother Brandham, he talks he talks as a
[1:27:52] as a father
[1:27:54] how he the children his children the
[1:27:57] children of Israel. That's how he just
[1:27:59] hovered over them while they were in
[1:28:01] Egypt and they were in slavery. But he
[1:28:03] hovered over them. Then when they came
[1:28:04] out into the wilderness, he cared for
[1:28:06] them and clothed them and gave them
[1:28:09] water and gave them food. Why? Because
[1:28:11] he's a father. He's caring for them. But
[1:28:14] that wasn't his complete thought. He had
[1:28:16] to bring them out. He had to bring them
[1:28:18] into their own land. He had to make a
[1:28:20] nation out of them that he could set
[1:28:21] forth in the earth. And here the here
[1:28:23] Israel is today. I mean the people of
[1:28:26] the world. I heard him interview some of
[1:28:29] the young people even in Israel. They
[1:28:31] interviewed him and said why why are the
[1:28:33] Jews thought of the way that they are?
[1:28:35] And the first young woman, she was
[1:28:36] probably 20, 21, 22, might have been 18.
[1:28:39] She said because we're God's people.
[1:28:44] I got and interviewed three and two of
[1:28:46] them said we are different because we're
[1:28:48] God's people.
[1:28:51] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Somebody has a revelation.
[1:28:53] We're different because we're God's
[1:28:55] people. That's why. Oh my.
[1:28:59] &gt;&gt; You say we're not different because
[1:29:01] we're message believers. We're different
[1:29:03] because we're God's people.
[1:29:05] &gt;&gt; And God sent a message to cause us to
[1:29:08] realize we're his people.
[1:29:12] I hope you're getting it.
[1:29:13] &gt;&gt; I hope it's sinking down deep. I'm going
[1:29:16] to conclude in just a few moments.
[1:29:19] So, it's not good to be alone. I'll make
[1:29:23] him a helpmate.
[1:29:26] I'll make him one so that he will not be
[1:29:30] separate.
[1:29:32] He will not be
[1:29:34] alone.
[1:29:41] Now,
[1:29:43] I'm just going to touch on this and then
[1:29:45] I'm going to close.
[1:29:48] When he said and the scripture which I
[1:29:50] read in the text, just follow it,
[1:29:52] please.
[1:29:54] Now, you've got the whole my whole
[1:29:56] thought that I labored on this evening.
[1:30:00] So, he said,
[1:30:03] "You'll be a kingdom
[1:30:07] You'll be a domain for me.
[1:30:12] You'll be a people that I will reign
[1:30:15] over.
[1:30:19] You will make me, brother Brandham said
[1:30:22] that with with Moses and through Moses
[1:30:25] they had a prophet king. Not that Moses
[1:30:28] was the king but that God was the king
[1:30:31] through the prophet. He made them king
[1:30:34] because what the what the king decrees
[1:30:36] the people do. The king is their
[1:30:39] protector.
[1:30:41] And then the time came, listen to them
[1:30:44] now. And they looked around and they saw
[1:30:46] other nations. They saw other people.
[1:30:50] They saw the prosperity. They saw the
[1:30:52] pump and the glory of these other
[1:30:54] nations. They said, "Make us a king."
[1:30:57] What a tragic mistake.
[1:31:00] &gt;&gt; Make us a king.
[1:31:04] Do you remember some months ago I spoke
[1:31:07] over this pulpit? The word is king.
[1:31:11] &gt;&gt; When I people take and they want to
[1:31:14] start to adjust the word, you know what
[1:31:16] they're saying? Give us a king.
[1:31:19] &gt;&gt; Give us a king that kind of fits the
[1:31:21] modern trend. We've got we've got we've
[1:31:24] got questions we're not getting answered
[1:31:26] by this king.
[1:31:31] We've got things in our modern age
[1:31:33] that's not being answered by this king
[1:31:36] of past ages. And so make us another
[1:31:39] king. Let's adjust things. Let's arrange
[1:31:41] things differently. I tell you that our
[1:31:44] Lord, our word, is king. And he has the
[1:31:46] answer for every situation.
[1:31:49] &gt;&gt; Absolutely. The answer for every
[1:31:51] situation.
[1:31:53] &gt;&gt; And he wants to reign. and you'll be a
[1:31:56] kingdom of priests unto me.
[1:32:01] And if you'll follow my word and live by
[1:32:05] my covenants,
[1:32:08] not only will I become king,
[1:32:12] but you'll you'll become exalted
[1:32:15] and you'll become queen.
[1:32:18] You'll become you'll sit in the throne
[1:32:20] with me.
[1:32:22] That's what the message is all about.
[1:32:26] You'll sit in the throne with me. You'll
[1:32:27] sit in my domain.
[1:32:31] Part of it. That's the only way it can
[1:32:34] happen.
[1:32:36] And maybe those things sound beyond us.
[1:32:41] When God said you'll be a kingdom,
[1:32:45] he wasn't just saying that I'll be king,
[1:32:47] but he wanted to exalt that nation also.
[1:33:00] Let me just speak about Moses for a
[1:33:02] moment.
[1:33:04] He said in the Smyrnian church age,
[1:33:08] God was the leader of the people
[1:33:11] actually.
[1:33:13] So he makes a statement, God was a
[1:33:14] leader of the people, but actually
[1:33:17] he was their king. He was a father king.
[1:33:22] He took care of Israel like a man cares
[1:33:25] for his family. He fed them. He fought
[1:33:28] their battles. He smoothed away their
[1:33:32] difficulties and settled their problems.
[1:33:35] He just busied himself over them.
[1:33:39] &gt;&gt; You think he's changed?
[1:33:41] &gt;&gt; He's busy himself over you.
[1:33:45] &gt;&gt; I don't know if you can accept that. If
[1:33:47] you can acknowledge that God was busy
[1:33:50] today busying himself over your affairs,
[1:33:55] &gt;&gt; you're his children,
[1:33:57] &gt;&gt; your family,
[1:33:59] &gt;&gt; he gave his life for you.
[1:34:02] &gt;&gt; He busied himself over them. They were
[1:34:05] the only nation to which he was truly
[1:34:09] God.
[1:34:11] &gt;&gt; Lots of nations. There's lots of
[1:34:13] denominations,
[1:34:15] but there's only one people who he
[1:34:17] visited himself over because through
[1:34:20] them, he was identified and truly was
[1:34:23] God amongst them.
[1:34:28] &gt;&gt; All I can do is say it, friends. It's
[1:34:30] all I can do is say it. You're the ones
[1:34:32] that have to believe it. You're the ones
[1:34:34] that have to accept it. He said, but he
[1:34:36] said, "And they were the only nation to
[1:34:39] which he was truly God." But one day
[1:34:42] they got to looking around one day and
[1:34:45] they saw the Philistines and other
[1:34:47] nations with kings over them. It caught
[1:34:50] their eyes and they decided that they
[1:34:52] ought to humanize their leadership. So
[1:34:55] they wanted a king. Now God was going to
[1:34:58] humanize the leadership himself in the
[1:35:01] person of the Lord Jesus. They just got
[1:35:03] ahead of him. They wanted a human to
[1:35:06] humanize the king. They had a spirit
[1:35:08] king, a god king. They said, "We want
[1:35:11] somebody we can touch. We want somebody
[1:35:13] we can handle." And they they yearned
[1:35:15] for something that God was going to give
[1:35:17] them anyway. He was going to personalize
[1:35:19] or humanized as king in the person of
[1:35:22] Jesus Christ.
[1:35:24] &gt;&gt; And even when he did,
[1:35:28] oh my.
[1:35:31] The scripture tells of Jesus, and you've
[1:35:34] heard me say it before, and he went and
[1:35:36] he was alone. and he went into the
[1:35:38] garden alone.
[1:35:41] Even in his human form, he desired
[1:35:45] company.
[1:35:47] &gt;&gt; He needed that that friendship. He
[1:35:49] needed that strength of those that knew
[1:35:52] him.
[1:35:56] &gt;&gt; You know, I just want to conclude
[1:35:59] for this evening.
[1:36:03] And I've seen families isolate
[1:36:06] themselves, they wither.
[1:36:09] &gt;&gt; I see individuals isolate themselves,
[1:36:13] they wither.
[1:36:14] &gt;&gt; They dry right up.
[1:36:16] &gt;&gt; I've never seen it ever, ever in all my
[1:36:19] years succeed.
[1:36:21] &gt;&gt; If people draw away
[1:36:24] &gt;&gt; and become isolated, they wither. They
[1:36:27] dry up because why? It is opposed to
[1:36:31] God's program. When God brought you into
[1:36:33] the kingdom, he said you're many
[1:36:35] members, but you are one body.
[1:36:38] &gt;&gt; And you cannot deny that one body. If
[1:36:41] you do, then you're the one that
[1:36:43] suffers.
[1:36:44] &gt;&gt; You're the one that suffers. And that
[1:36:46] individual suffers or that family
[1:36:48] suffers.
[1:36:50] &gt;&gt; Oh, I've seen them and they've they've
[1:36:51] gone off, spun off into some dark place.
[1:36:55] But when they realize I'm a part of the
[1:36:58] of the body, I've got some slides I'm
[1:37:01] just going to show you quickly. They're
[1:37:02] scriptures. We're going to read them.
[1:37:05] You see, listen now. I hope you get
[1:37:09] this.
[1:37:11] When we become,
[1:37:13] if we should isolate ourselves,
[1:37:17] listen now to my warning. if we should
[1:37:20] isolate ourselves. We're actually saying
[1:37:24] we're opposing my text tonight. I said
[1:37:27] the inst God instituted the congregation
[1:37:30] of Israel. But when God said and it tied
[1:37:34] it up very very clearly in my mind when
[1:37:36] he had his man had his own image. It's
[1:37:40] not good that he's alone. It's not good
[1:37:44] that Abraham's alone. I got to I I I
[1:37:48] I've got to move this thing forward. I
[1:37:50] have to change its structure. It has to
[1:37:53] come into a family. It has to come into
[1:37:56] and and from that son has to come
[1:37:58] another son. And then has to come 12 12
[1:38:01] sons because they not one of them can be
[1:38:04] separate. That even though Joseph was
[1:38:06] sold, he has to be brought back in
[1:38:08] because this has to be out of here has
[1:38:10] to come a nation. And this nation has to
[1:38:13] evolve into something else into
[1:38:15] something further. It has to be a
[1:38:17] special kind of a nation. It has to be a
[1:38:20] hated nation.
[1:38:23] &gt;&gt; And finally, I'm going to call them. I'm
[1:38:25] going to call them the congregation at a
[1:38:27] certain point in time when I'm going to
[1:38:29] deliver them and they're going to come
[1:38:30] out under blood. Now, you're not just a
[1:38:32] nation. You're going to be a
[1:38:33] congregation and you're the congregation
[1:38:36] of Israel.
[1:38:37] &gt;&gt; Israel who prevailed because through
[1:38:39] you, I'm going to be a testimony.
[1:38:41] Through you, you're going to say the
[1:38:43] same thing. You're going to be hated all
[1:38:45] down through the generations. And the
[1:38:46] Jewish people have been that.
[1:38:49] &gt;&gt; Why? Because they had to say it again
[1:38:52] and again and again and again. They had
[1:38:54] to be identified. Oh my. They've tried
[1:38:58] to be like other nations. It won't work.
[1:39:00] &gt;&gt; They can never be like another nation.
[1:39:02] They're separate as they can be. They
[1:39:04] try to design their government. They try
[1:39:06] to have everything the same as other
[1:39:08] nations, but they're always different.
[1:39:10] Totally different. They get on airplane,
[1:39:12] they're different. They go traveling.
[1:39:14] They go into other nations. They go here
[1:39:16] in the United States and they become
[1:39:17] Wall Street Jews, but they're still
[1:39:19] different people.
[1:39:22] &gt;&gt; Amen. They're still different. They
[1:39:24] cannot escape that identity.
[1:39:26] &gt;&gt; Are you following me?
[1:39:28] &gt;&gt; Because they're different.
[1:39:31] &gt;&gt; If you're a believer, you can backslide.
[1:39:34] And I don't care if you backslide. I'm
[1:39:36] sure I care. But I mean, if you do, it's
[1:39:38] still it. You cannot change your
[1:39:40] identification. You'll be the most
[1:39:42] miserable human in a backsliden state
[1:39:45] because you're a child of God.
[1:39:47] &gt;&gt; And you can't change that identity.
[1:39:50] And what you did, you lost your you lost
[1:39:53] your understanding that you were a part.
[1:39:55] And what you really said to God is uh
[1:39:58] it's good for man to be alone.
[1:40:02] &gt;&gt; Because by God making you a part of
[1:40:05] another another one, he's saying it's
[1:40:07] not good that I'm alone and I've got to
[1:40:10] have this part. But in order for me to
[1:40:13] be complete, I got to have another part
[1:40:15] with this part. And I got to have that
[1:40:17] part and this part and that part and and
[1:40:20] all these parts must be together because
[1:40:22] they must be in a body because it's a
[1:40:25] body I had in my mind. Not just a whole
[1:40:28] group of loose-nit people in the church
[1:40:30] here and a church there and this one's
[1:40:31] Bible way and that one's something else
[1:40:33] and this is something else. That isn't
[1:40:34] what God had in his mind. He had one
[1:40:36] body, many membered, all working
[1:40:39] together, one a part of another. That's
[1:40:42] what God had in his mind.
[1:40:46] &gt;&gt; I hope I'm getting it across to you.
[1:40:48] &gt;&gt; And by when you realize that we're a
[1:40:50] part of one another, then you're really
[1:40:52] saying it wasn't good that he's alone
[1:40:56] &gt;&gt; because I'm not only a part in order to
[1:40:58] make that up. So, he's not alone,
[1:41:01] &gt;&gt; but there has to be another part.
[1:41:03] &gt;&gt; You have to be a part. You have to be a
[1:41:05] part you sisters. Every everyone every
[1:41:08] member must be a part.
[1:41:11] &gt;&gt; And when every part
[1:41:14] is complete in a simple statement of a
[1:41:17] prophet and the last one comes in then
[1:41:22] he'll say I have no more thought
[1:41:26] of being alone. The last one has been
[1:41:30] manifested on earth. I have no more
[1:41:32] thought of. Okay, come home children.
[1:41:35] Come home.
[1:41:41] &gt;&gt; Won't it be something marvelous?
[1:41:43] &gt;&gt; We come together and he out of whom we
[1:41:46] came
[1:41:48] is able to declare, I'm whole.
[1:41:52] &gt;&gt; I'm complete.
[1:41:55] I'm here now
[1:41:58] &gt;&gt; with my queen bride.
[1:42:00] &gt;&gt; The wife of the lamb.
[1:42:03] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:42:04] &gt;&gt; We were a Christian once, but that
[1:42:06] wasn't enough.
[1:42:08] &gt;&gt; We were we were called out. That wasn't
[1:42:10] enough.
[1:42:11] &gt;&gt; We got into a church and said, "Praise
[1:42:13] God, I'm saved. I was down on all. I
[1:42:14] wept and all. That was wonderful, but
[1:42:16] that wasn't enough."
[1:42:18] &gt;&gt; And then we finally got a revelation.
[1:42:19] No, I'm part of a group of people. I'm a
[1:42:22] part of a of a of a of an entity.
[1:42:26] &gt;&gt; That's wonderful.
[1:42:28] Then fine, you say by being a part of
[1:42:31] them, I'm a part of God.
[1:42:35] &gt;&gt; I'm saying something
[1:42:37] very, very profound.
[1:42:40] &gt;&gt; You can't be isolated and be a part of
[1:42:42] God.
[1:42:43] &gt;&gt; You've got to come back into your
[1:42:46] position of one body. One body.
[1:42:49] Otherwise, you got to tear pages out of
[1:42:51] the Bible, and we daring do that. You
[1:42:54] got to take words out of the Bible, and
[1:42:55] we can't do that. The Bible doesn't
[1:42:58] speak of just individual isolated
[1:43:01] members off and some satellite of their
[1:43:04] own. I'm not talking about this church
[1:43:07] of the people here. I'm talking about
[1:43:09] the overall, the whole overall. But it
[1:43:11] what pertains to the body of Christ
[1:43:13] pertains to this body as well. this
[1:43:16] unit. We're just all we are as a unit of
[1:43:19] this overall body. Let me have those
[1:43:21] slides and we're going to close with
[1:43:23] this.
[1:43:24] One body. For as we have many members in
[1:43:28] one body, and all members have not the
[1:43:32] same office.
[1:43:35] So we being many, we have it up there.
[1:43:38] So we being many are one body. I'd like
[1:43:42] the congregation to read the second
[1:43:44] verse again. So we being many are one
[1:43:50] body in Christ and everyone members one
[1:43:54] of another.
[1:43:56] &gt;&gt; Not everyone members.
[1:43:59] &gt;&gt; This isn't a membership. Everyone
[1:44:01] members one of another.
[1:44:05] You're part of the person in front of
[1:44:07] you, the person behind you, the person
[1:44:08] beside you, the people on the platform,
[1:44:11] the people across the church, the people
[1:44:12] up in the balcony. We're all part of one
[1:44:14] another. How do we fit? We don't know.
[1:44:16] We didn't make this body. He made the
[1:44:18] body.
[1:44:20] &gt;&gt; I don't know how this body works. How I
[1:44:22] know how that one works.
[1:44:27] &gt;&gt; I just went to a doctor yesterday. Said,
[1:44:29] "You did?" I sure did.
[1:44:33] I went to a doctor yesterday. I said, 'I
[1:44:36] don't understand what's happening. He
[1:44:37] said, 'What's happening?' I said, I'm
[1:44:38] having some spells that I don't know. I
[1:44:40] just feel all loose inside. I feel
[1:44:42] fluttery. I feel this. Uh, and I notice
[1:44:46] that I get real hungry right at that
[1:44:48] time. I have to go and eat something.
[1:44:52] He said, "Are you all right after you
[1:44:53] eat?" I said, "Yeah, it goes away."
[1:44:56] Well, that's the solution. I got to keep
[1:44:57] eating. That's for sure.
[1:45:00] So I told my wife today, I got I I sure
[1:45:02] got to keep eating. That's for sure. I I
[1:45:04] don't dare get hungry.
[1:45:07] Brother Gary raised his hand. He
[1:45:08] believes that doctrine.
[1:45:11] I got a few others. My goodness, I got
[1:45:15] more friends here than I realized.
[1:45:19] Yeah.
[1:45:20] Well, he said, uh, you're glucose
[1:45:24] intolerant. I said, what's that mean?
[1:45:27] Well, you're glucose intolerant. you
[1:45:29] know, he said, "It's either this or it's
[1:45:31] that. Your thyroid's producing too much,
[1:45:33] you know, insulin or this or that or the
[1:45:35] other thing." And uh uh he said, "Do you
[1:45:39] eat much sugar?" I eat a lot of honey. I
[1:45:40] said,
[1:45:43] "How much do you eat?" Oh, I said,
[1:45:46] "Several tablespoons, probably three
[1:45:47] tablespoons a day." He said, "Cut it in
[1:45:50] half."
[1:45:51] Oh, that was a big sacrifice.
[1:45:56] So my wife prepares breakfast this
[1:46:00] morning and there's no toast. There's
[1:46:03] nothing to put honey on. I said, "You
[1:46:05] didn't make any toast." She said,
[1:46:08] "You're supposed to cut it back." I
[1:46:09] said, "Just 50%."
[1:46:11] Just 50%. You generally give me two
[1:46:13] slices. At least give me one.
[1:46:19] I don't understand this body. And then
[1:46:22] we got those that be, oh, we're experts
[1:46:24] on how the body of Christ works. We
[1:46:25] don't, you don't know how it works,
[1:46:27] &gt;&gt; but I can tell you one thing. You're a
[1:46:29] member of it
[1:46:30] &gt;&gt; and you've got to be available. You have
[1:46:32] to be in a place
[1:46:35] &gt;&gt; where you can act and react and
[1:46:37] function. One member to another. We're
[1:46:39] all members, one for another. And I'm
[1:46:41] going to close right away. Let's read
[1:46:42] the next ones.
[1:46:45] For we being many are one bread and one
[1:46:48] body. For we are all partakers of that
[1:46:51] one bread. That's how come we're one
[1:46:54] bread. One body. Because we're partakers
[1:46:56] of one bread.
[1:46:57] &gt;&gt; Next one, please. For as the body is one
[1:47:01] and hath many members, and all the
[1:47:03] members of that one body, being many are
[1:47:05] one body, so also is Christ. For by one
[1:47:09] spirit are we all baptized into one
[1:47:12] body. If you were baptized by one
[1:47:14] spirit, I can tell you you were not
[1:47:17] baptized into numerous bodies. You were
[1:47:19] baptized into one body.
[1:47:22] &gt;&gt; Every person baptized is baptized into
[1:47:25] one body.
[1:47:32] &gt;&gt; Whether we be Jews or Gentiles, whether
[1:47:34] we be bond or free, and have been all
[1:47:36] made to drink into one spirit. And the
[1:47:38] next one, for the body is not one
[1:47:41] member, but many. If the foot shall say,
[1:47:45] because I am not the hand, I'm not of
[1:47:46] the body. I is it therefore not of the
[1:47:49] body? And if the ears shall say, because
[1:47:51] I'm not of the eye, I'm not of the body.
[1:47:53] Is it therefore not of the body? If the
[1:47:56] whole body were an eye, where were the
[1:47:58] hearing? If the whole body, if the whole
[1:48:00] were hearing, where were the smelling?
[1:48:03] And but now hath God said, but now hath
[1:48:06] God said, Amen.
[1:48:10] &gt;&gt; Let's say that. But now hath God set the
[1:48:14] members, every one of them, in the body,
[1:48:18] as it hath pleased me,
[1:48:23] as it hath pleased him.
[1:48:30] &gt;&gt; And if they were all one member, if they
[1:48:33] were all one member, where's the body?
[1:48:37] And so we have a many membered body,
[1:48:41] but now are they many members, but yet
[1:48:44] one body. There is one body and one
[1:48:48] spirit, even as you are called in one
[1:48:51] hope of your calling.
[1:48:54] And that's it.
[1:48:59] &gt;&gt; You know why you're in this body? Cuz
[1:49:01] God didn't want to be alone.
[1:49:05] in order for him that alone means
[1:49:08] separated from something. So he had to
[1:49:10] have this added this added. He had to
[1:49:12] have the saints here in 2004, the saints
[1:49:15] in Cloverdale, Washington, Seattle, the
[1:49:19] saints in this area. Somehow, you know,
[1:49:21] I see it on the big on the big scale. I
[1:49:23] see it on the big stage. We had to
[1:49:25] interact somehow. We had to we got
[1:49:28] brothers going over to to China and to
[1:49:31] Russia and and we're we're we're we're
[1:49:34] connected and there's there's brothers
[1:49:36] other brothers other ministers and they
[1:49:38] may go to one part of the world another
[1:49:41] to another part of the world and we hear
[1:49:43] about it. So when you hear a report or
[1:49:46] you hear now which you will be hearing
[1:49:48] in the next couple of weeks you'll be
[1:49:49] hearing about Vietnam. I asked right
[1:49:51] away. Oh,
[1:49:55] I said to Brother Timothy, I took
[1:49:57] Brother Ryerson said, "Brother Timothy,
[1:49:59] here's a big map of Vietnam. Where were
[1:50:01] you?" Oh, he said, "We're up here in
[1:50:04] Hanoi."
[1:50:06] Remember when Hanoi was, you know, there
[1:50:08] was going to be bombed,
[1:50:11] a terrible war in Vietnam. A lot of
[1:50:14] boys, American boys, never came back.
[1:50:17] buried over there in the soil, burned
[1:50:20] with flames and warfare.
[1:50:24] I didn't rejoice over that, but I
[1:50:25] rejoice now. He could put his finger and
[1:50:28] say, "Here, we had a big group and I
[1:50:31] baptized 20 here." And then here's the
[1:50:33] ministers in a van and we're teaching
[1:50:35] here and they had a bunch of ministers.
[1:50:37] We met about a hundred ministers. I
[1:50:39] thought, "Oh, what I see right away,
[1:50:42] they're part of me. I may never see
[1:50:44] them, but they're part of me. and
[1:50:46] anything I can do for them, if we can
[1:50:48] send something over, if we can just help
[1:50:50] them get a message in their hand. And
[1:50:52] brother Murphy, brother Timothy, please
[1:50:55] keep on. Just keep on. He said, "Well,
[1:50:57] we have 147 messages now." Oh, keep on,
[1:51:01] keep on. Why?
[1:51:04] It's this part of the body.
[1:51:07] Wanting to reach out to another part of
[1:51:10] the body saying, "Can I help you?"
[1:51:14] You know, if I start to lift something
[1:51:15] with this hand, this may sound simple.
[1:51:17] If I start to lift something with this
[1:51:19] hand, I can't do it or I got an ache in
[1:51:21] my wrist or something. It it doesn't
[1:51:23] have to beg, please, please, left hand,
[1:51:26] help me.
[1:51:28] &gt;&gt; It doesn't have to send any signals
[1:51:29] through my brain. I just grab it with
[1:51:31] the other hand and lift it up. And you
[1:51:34] know, your whole body, your legs, your
[1:51:35] knees, your toes, all tense up because
[1:51:37] you're having to do something with your
[1:51:39] body. Every member is bent for the one
[1:51:42] purpose,
[1:51:43] &gt;&gt; one objective.
[1:51:45] &gt;&gt; And that's why we're here.
[1:51:47] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:51:49] &gt;&gt; And no matter what part of the earth
[1:51:51] it's in, it's one body.
[1:51:54] &gt;&gt; Glory to God.
[1:51:55] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:51:57] &gt;&gt; We're going to baptize somebody just
[1:51:58] now. Why don't they go to be baptized?
[1:52:01] Why don't we stand? Would you do that?
[1:52:02] Just change your position.
[1:52:09] Our dear Lord,
[1:52:14] your word is so special.
[1:52:17] Your thoughts are so special.
[1:52:20] We're just seeking tonight to convey
[1:52:24] those things that you lay upon my own
[1:52:28] heart, Lord. And I trust that the Holy
[1:52:31] Spirit now will take them and just make
[1:52:33] it a reality to the people. Lord, I pray
[1:52:36] that you will bless, oh God, the word as
[1:52:40] it's meditated upon. And perhaps he'll
[1:52:43] open a message and hear a tape, open the
[1:52:47] scriptures, and then a scripture will
[1:52:50] just be the right place at the right
[1:52:52] time. Bless your people, Lord. Bless
[1:52:56] your children. Bless this family, oh
[1:53:00] God. Bless the many membered bride of
[1:53:03] Jesus Christ has been united into a
[1:53:06] relationship of husband and wife. Oh
[1:53:09] God, I cannot grasp the depth of this
[1:53:12] oneness, but I'm seeking to know it,
[1:53:15] seeking to understand it. Pray you'll
[1:53:17] forgive our frailty, forgive our lack of
[1:53:20] understanding, and I pray that you will
[1:53:23] implant within us a great capacity to
[1:53:26] understand the mind and purpose of God.
[1:53:30] And Lord Jesus, that we might realize
[1:53:32] tonight as we leave here, we are
[1:53:35] connected. We are connected to one
[1:53:37] another. We're connected by the purpose
[1:53:40] of God. You and your divine purpose
[1:53:45] have taken each member Lord knowing what
[1:53:48] each one needs and you have connected us
[1:53:52] and I thank you for that. I thank you in
[1:53:55] the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.
[1:53:59] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:54:04] I want to just sing how great is our
[1:54:06] God. How great is his name?
[1:54:11] How great is our God?
[1:54:16] How great is his name?
[1:54:21] He's the greatest one.
[1:54:27] Forever the same.
[1:54:32] He
[1:54:33] the water
[1:54:37] of the mighty Red Sea.
[1:54:41] And he said, "I'll never leave you.
[1:54:46] Put your trust in me."
[1:54:50] How great is his word. How great is our
[1:54:53] God.
[1:54:56] Oh, how great is his word.
[1:55:00] blessed word is the greatest
[1:55:07] that ever was heard.
[1:55:11] Jesus
[1:55:13] treasure
[1:55:21] and he said I'm going to give you
[1:55:26] anointed ministry. Let's sing that verse
[1:55:29] once again. How great is our God.
[1:55:36] How great is his word.
[1:55:40] He's the greatest one
[1:55:45] that ever was heard.
[1:55:50] He
[1:55:52] tur
[1:56:00] and he said I'm going to give you
[1:56:04] anointed ministry.
[1:56:10] God rich in mercy. God rich in love.
[1:56:13] God rich in mercy.
[1:56:19] God rich in mercy.
[1:56:25] Send me
[1:56:30] God.
[1:56:36] are rich in praise,
[1:56:39] heart,
[1:56:41] sending his from heaven above.
[1:56:47] Sing to all men today.
[1:56:54] It's God rich in mercy. Oh, I know. God
[1:57:00] rich in mercy.
[1:57:03] Let's sing it again. Is God rich in
[1:57:06] mercy?
[1:57:10] God rich in mercy.
[1:57:16] Sending his son
[1:57:18] we were unound.
[1:57:21] God rich in mercy.
[1:57:26] It's God rich in grace. God rich in
[1:57:30] love, sending his best from heaven
[1:57:35] above,
[1:57:36] saying to all men today,
[1:57:44] God rich in mercy.
[1:57:50] God rich in mercy.
[1:57:55] &gt;&gt; Amen. 2391 on the screen.
[1:58:03] We'll start with the chorus.
[1:58:08] Coming
[1:58:10] home.
[1:58:13] Coming
[1:58:15] home.
[1:58:17] Ever
[1:58:19] more
[1:58:21] to run
[1:58:26] more open
[1:58:28] wide
[1:58:30] and arms
[1:58:32] of love.
[1:58:34] Lord,
[1:58:36] I'm coming
[1:58:38] home.
[1:58:40] One more time.
[1:58:42] I'm coming
[1:58:44] home.
[1:58:46] I'll be
[1:58:48] home
[1:58:50] never
[1:58:52] more to go.
[1:58:58] Oh
[1:59:00] w my thine arms
[1:59:04] above.
[1:59:06] Lord I'm coming.
[1:59:10] Oh I wonder.
[1:59:14] I wondered
[1:59:16] far
[1:59:18] away
[1:59:20] from God.
[1:59:22] And now
[1:59:24] I'm coming
[1:59:26] home.
[1:59:30] The path of sin.
[1:59:34] you long
[1:59:38] and oh Lord I'm coming
[1:59:42] home
[1:59:46] I'm coming
[1:59:48] home
[1:59:50] coming
[1:59:52] home
[1:59:54] never
[1:59:56] more to Oh
[2:00:04] my
[2:00:06] heart,
[2:00:10] Lord, I'm coming.
[2:00:14] Oh, the last verse. My soul
[2:00:20] is sick and my heart
[2:00:24] is sore.
[2:00:26] And now
[2:00:28] I'm coming
[2:00:30] home.
[2:00:33] My strength
[2:00:36] you my hope restored
[2:00:42] Lord. I'm coming
[2:00:46] home. If you need to make that step
[2:00:48] tonight, take a step. Saints coming
[2:00:52] home. I'm coming
[2:00:56] home.
[2:00:58] Never
[2:01:00] more to
[2:01:06] open with my
[2:01:09] heart.
[2:01:14] Lord, I'm coming
[2:01:17] home.
[2:01:19] God bless you. You can have your seats.
[2:01:26] Very appropriate song.
[2:01:29] Another manifested thought coming back
[2:01:31] to the mind of God as we heard this
[2:01:34] evening. Sister Betty
[2:01:36] Betty.
[2:01:37] &gt;&gt; Betty Anne. All right. Sister Betty.
[2:01:41] That I love the scriptures. Brother
[2:01:43] Biscllow was ministering
[2:01:46] and said out of Genesis 22,
[2:01:49] "And God had taken,
[2:01:52] God had taken from the man the rib, and
[2:01:56] the rib which the Lord God had taken
[2:01:58] from man made he a woman and brought her
[2:02:02] unto the man." But that was so
[2:02:05] tremendous because what is represented
[2:02:08] here in a baptismal tank has nothing to
[2:02:10] do outside of God bringing the woman
[2:02:15] back to the man Christ Jesus.
[2:02:17] &gt;&gt; This has been the sovereign leadership
[2:02:20] of the Holy Spirit. Sister Bedan after
[2:02:23] 30 years
[2:02:25] coming back
[2:02:27] coming home to the very thought of God.
[2:02:31] And the Bible says this,
[2:02:35] "For the promise is unto you." Sister
[2:02:37] Betty Anne, she was just saying as we're
[2:02:39] coming down the stairs, I need the Holy
[2:02:41] Ghost. I need an infilling of God.
[2:02:46] For the promise is unto you
[2:02:49] and to your children, and to all that
[2:02:52] are far off, even as many as the Lord
[2:02:55] our God shall call. The Bible goes on to
[2:02:57] say, "And with many other words did he
[2:02:59] testify and exhort, saying, save
[2:03:01] yourselves from this untoward
[2:03:04] generation."
[2:03:05] Then they that gladly received his word
[2:03:10] were baptized,
[2:03:12] and the same day there were added unto
[2:03:15] them about 3,000 souls.
[2:03:18] I believe that something tugged at your
[2:03:20] heart, Sister Bettyanne, and that's why
[2:03:22] you're here. Maybe you want to say
[2:03:24] something to the people.
[2:03:29] I'm just glad to be here tonight.
[2:03:34] I heard brother Brandon's message about
[2:03:36] 30 years ago and
[2:03:39] I got away from him and I married a
[2:03:41] non-believer but the Lord saved him in
[2:03:43] the He had cancer and I had to look
[2:03:46] after him at home and uh my friend
[2:03:49] Muriel, we crossed paths a year ago and
[2:03:53] he said to come out for a visit and uh
[2:03:57] where I live there's nobody can baptize
[2:04:00] me. So I thought this is my time and God
[2:04:05] was telling me for a while I have to
[2:04:09] deal with this.
[2:04:11] And um I thank the Lord that he made a
[2:04:15] way.
[2:04:16] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:04:18] &gt;&gt; Amen. And I must say that I feel at home
[2:04:22] here because I started to wear skirts
[2:04:26] again and
[2:04:28] some of my friends were bapt people and
[2:04:30] uh I started to feel I didn't quite fit
[2:04:34] but God gives them when my husband was
[2:04:36] sick and he didn't forget them.
[2:04:40] He has a plan
[2:04:42] and he doesn't forget anything.
[2:04:45] And I'm grateful for everybody who's
[2:04:48] prayed for me.
[2:04:49] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:04:51] &gt;&gt; People I know and people I don't.
[2:04:55] And
[2:04:57] we won't overcome
[2:05:00] unless we have the Holy Ghost.
[2:05:04] And when I was young, I
[2:05:07] did receive the Holy Spirit
[2:05:09] way back in the 60s.
[2:05:12] started to stammer with lips and had an
[2:05:15] experience about a couple years ago
[2:05:17] after my husband died and I was a bit
[2:05:20] frightened because I was on my own and I
[2:05:23] know the Lord just wanted me to let go
[2:05:26] but I couldn't and so
[2:05:30] me won't overcome without it
[2:05:32] &gt;&gt; right
[2:05:33] &gt;&gt; I pray
[2:05:35] that it gives me the strength I need
[2:05:38] &gt;&gt; this time
[2:05:39] &gt;&gt; Amen Amen.
[2:05:46] Let's pray. Heavenly Father,
[2:05:51] Lord, you have dealt.
[2:05:53] You have called and Sister Betty Anne
[2:05:56] Lord has responded to the call. And we
[2:06:01] know when he, the Spirit of truth, has
[2:06:02] come, he shall lead you into all truth.
[2:06:06] And we believe, Father God, that you're
[2:06:08] leading our dear sister back to the very
[2:06:11] thought that you've had for her, Lord,
[2:06:13] before the foundation of the world. We
[2:06:16] pray, Father, that you would fill her
[2:06:17] with the Holy Ghost and fire. Grant to
[2:06:20] her this overcoming power that her heart
[2:06:22] is yearning for. Lord, if there's a deep
[2:06:25] that calls to the deep, then there's a
[2:06:27] deep to respond. And Lord, there's a
[2:06:29] deep calling within her heart this
[2:06:31] evening for more of God, to be filled
[2:06:33] with God. I say Lord, let the fire fall.
[2:06:36] Let the Holy Spirit flood her soul. Let
[2:06:39] her be a living testimony as we heard
[2:06:41] this evening. Lord, let her be a part of
[2:06:43] that congregation of the living God. And
[2:06:46] Father, that she would find her part
[2:06:48] within this glorious body of the bride
[2:06:50] of Jesus Christ. Would you fill her now,
[2:06:53] Lord Jesus, as we commit her to you in
[2:06:55] Jesus name? and Sister Betty Anne, by
[2:06:58] your confession
[2:07:00] that Jesus Christ is your personal
[2:07:02] savior, I baptize you in true Christian
[2:07:05] baptism in the name of our Lord Jesus
[2:07:09] Christ. Amen.
[2:07:24] &gt;&gt; Sister Muriel, don't go anywhere just
[2:07:25] for a moment.
[2:07:28] Sister Muriel Seus taken a picture of
[2:07:32] our sister and she brought her actually
[2:07:34] to the service on Sunday.
[2:07:39] And uh talk about the body. I'm not too
[2:07:43] sure just exactly how my wife and I met
[2:07:47] Sister Muriel and her husband Ben in
[2:07:50] Toronto
[2:07:52] in the 1960s.
[2:07:56] And little did we realize and I think
[2:07:59] they just were finding out about the
[2:08:02] message and there was a small stir there
[2:08:06] and then we come out years later. I
[2:08:09] don't know when it was her and her
[2:08:11] husband finally moved out towards the
[2:08:12] Chilowak out there. He's
[2:08:16] a driver, a transport driver.
[2:08:19] And uh and every once in a while, Sister
[2:08:21] Muriel comes by. And uh here she come by
[2:08:26] with this other sister.
[2:08:29] Uh just to show you the mind of God.
[2:08:31] Now, I sit here today. I said, "Now
[2:08:34] there's a a member of the body from
[2:08:36] almost 40 years ago walks into the
[2:08:39] church with another one that needs
[2:08:41] Christ. And I I just have a few words
[2:08:44] with her. And the woman tells me I'm a
[2:08:47] backslider.
[2:08:48] And I I reach over and take a hold of
[2:08:51] brother Derek Paris's arm, who knows
[2:08:55] nothing about Sister Muriel, nothing
[2:08:57] about the woman is baptized. I squeeze
[2:08:59] his arm. I said, "What made you sing
[2:09:01] that song, Coming Home?"
[2:09:04] He said during the service,
[2:09:07] I thought it's a very strange song for a
[2:09:09] baptism, but it was exactly the song for
[2:09:12] this woman.
[2:09:14] &gt;&gt; Absolutely perfect. I tell you friends,
[2:09:17] it just makes my makes my whole being
[2:09:20] just tremble at the leadership of the
[2:09:23] Holy Spirit. And to come in and confirm
[2:09:26] right after a service is this is the
[2:09:29] body of Jesus Christ. one member, a
[2:09:32] sister coming, bringing another member,
[2:09:35] baptizing. You say, "Well, what's going
[2:09:37] to happen in the future?" I don't know,
[2:09:38] and I don't care. It's God's business
[2:09:41] what happens in the future. All I know
[2:09:43] is right now we're functioning.
[2:09:47] &gt;&gt; What gave her that desire? And I close
[2:09:49] with this. He says, "And there's
[2:09:52] something
[2:09:54] in us
[2:09:56] screams
[2:09:57] and calls to God." Yes.
[2:10:00] &gt;&gt; Can you identify with that?
[2:10:02] &gt;&gt; There's something in us that screams and
[2:10:05] calls to God. And the prophet said,
[2:10:08] "It's your soul
[2:10:09] &gt;&gt; calling out to your heavenly father,
[2:10:14] &gt;&gt; not just a God out there someplace. It's
[2:10:17] your soul.
[2:10:18] &gt;&gt; You got that craving. It's your soul
[2:10:21] calling out to your heavenly father."
[2:10:24] Oh, let's sing it again. Coming home.
[2:10:27] Let's stand. I'm glad I come home.
[2:10:32] Did you find the welcome mat out when
[2:10:34] you come?
[2:10:36] Amen. God bless you, Sister Muriel.
[2:10:40] Coming
[2:10:42] home.
[2:10:44] coming
[2:10:47] home
[2:10:53] to
[2:10:58] open
[2:11:02] and
[2:11:06] Lord
[2:11:08] I'm coming
[2:11:15] Thank you for coming. Each one of you
[2:11:18] are an integral part. Strengthen me
[2:11:21] tonight. I appreciate you.
[2:11:24] I'm going to ask brother Ryerson to come
[2:11:27] leaving tomorrow. Would you take
[2:11:29] greetings back brother William to
[2:11:31] Norway?
[2:11:33] We enjoyed you being here with us. Don't
[2:11:36] let it be another 28 years.
[2:11:39] Amen. I just want to greet you and thank
[2:11:42] you for the wonderful time that I have
[2:11:45] had here been uplifted in my spirit and
[2:11:49] uh I'm so happy to see all of you.
[2:11:52] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:11:53] &gt;&gt; And uh I don't believe it will be 28
[2:11:56] years.
[2:11:56] &gt;&gt; No, no,
[2:11:57] &gt;&gt; I uh I don't think we will be here
[2:12:00] another 28 years.
[2:12:02] &gt;&gt; I'm with you.
[2:12:04] And uh
[2:12:07] if I don't see you again here, I sure
[2:12:11] will see you there.
[2:12:12] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:12:13] &gt;&gt; Will you meet me there?
[2:12:14] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:12:15] &gt;&gt; God bless you and thank you for
[2:12:17] everything.
[2:12:17] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:12:18] &gt;&gt; As you let us pray for us. Let us bow
[2:12:21] our heads. Lord Jesus, we are so happy
[2:12:23] tonight that it was food for our soul.
[2:12:27] And that's the most important important
[2:12:30] part
[2:12:31] because this earthly body
[2:12:34] will be nothing
[2:12:36] but that soul that redeemed soul will
[2:12:40] never never end.
[2:12:43] Father God, I'm
[2:12:46] I'm stirred in my inner man tonight.
[2:12:51] What a body. What a people
[2:12:53] you have created by your spoken word.
[2:12:58] Oh God, I'm so
[2:13:02] I'm so glad to be a part of that body,
[2:13:06] Father God. And tonight
[2:13:09] we heard that wonderful word, it can
[2:13:12] only be you, Lord.
[2:13:14] And I ask that you will
[2:13:17] not just
[2:13:19] call us to church and to a a pew, but
[2:13:23] that we will
[2:13:25] bless us, Lord, and guide us and let us
[2:13:28] all find the place where we should be
[2:13:31] and that we can function as a whole
[2:13:34] body, helping the other member of the
[2:13:38] body.
[2:13:39] Lord, I thank you for these days from
[2:13:43] the depth of my heart. I love you, Lord.
[2:13:46] And I do believe these people love you.
[2:13:50] Father God, I'm just want to thank you.
[2:13:54] Guide us on. Give traveling mercy to
[2:13:57] those who are traveling. Lord, be with
[2:14:00] me.
[2:14:01] Guide me, Lord, in everything that I do
[2:14:03] and say.
[2:14:06] Oh, Father.
[2:14:08] And if I don't see these people again on
[2:14:10] the face of this earth, there will be a
[2:14:12] place where the whole body will be
[2:14:15] gathered.
[2:14:16] &gt;&gt; I thank you Lord in Jesus name. Amen.
[2:14:21] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:14:25] I'm going to ask for brother Ryersonson.
[2:14:26] He'll just be at the back and you can
[2:14:27] shake hands with him. Just just give him
[2:14:29] a greeting and bid him God's speed. God
[2:14:32] bless you all
[2:14:34] in the name of Jesus Christ. Lord
[2:14:37] willing, we'll be here the Lord's day
[2:14:40] praying for a great time. You're
[2:14:42] dismissed.
[2:14:44] Amen.
