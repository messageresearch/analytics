[8:09] Heat. Heat. Heat.
[8:11] [Music]
[8:22] when I go.
[8:30] &gt;&gt; Just before we sing the next verse, I
[8:32] was reading a quote this morning.
[8:33] Brother Brandham said, "Let the great
[8:34] Holy Spirit that come down on the
[8:36] mountain the other day up there. I pray
[8:39] that it'll saturate every heart in here
[8:42] &gt;&gt; with his goodness and mercy, with
[8:44] understanding.
[8:46] We realize, Father, that that's what we
[8:48] need is to understand. For if we do not
[8:51] know what we're doing, then how do we
[8:53] know how to do it? But we must have
[8:56] understanding. As Daniel said, he had
[8:59] understanding by the prophet Jeremiah's
[9:02] writing. Father, we have understanding
[9:04] by the Holy Spirit's writing. He's
[9:07] revealed it to us in this hour. Give it
[9:09] to us, Lord. The desires that we have
[9:11] for thee. Is that your desire this
[9:13] morning? Amen. I'm thankful for the
[9:15] understanding what's going on in this
[9:17] earth that the Lord's given us. Amen.
[9:20] And if you don't understand what's going
[9:21] on, you can. Amen. We may not understand
[9:24] what happens to us day by day, but we've
[9:26] got someone whose thoughts are above our
[9:28] thoughts. Whose ways are above our ways.
[9:31] Amen. Whose ways are past finding out.
[9:34] Amen. All we want to do is walk in those
[9:35] bloodstained footprints. Amen. Let's
[9:37] sing the third verse together.
[9:45] Well, I don't know.
[9:49] I found you.
[9:53] Well, it may bring
[9:58] me poverty.
[10:02] Oh my
[10:06] who feeds the s
[10:10] you know he is the one
[10:14] will stand by me
[10:19] and the
[10:22] [Applause]
[10:22] [Music]
[10:23] be my worship
[10:28] me through
[10:30] all
[10:35] Oh by his presence
[10:39] [Music]
[10:41] before you
[10:44] will.
[10:47] I'm covered by his blood.
[10:55] [Music]
[11:00] Heat. Heat. Heat.
[11:04] [Music]

[11:37] you.

[23:02] disappointment.
[23:04] [Music]
[23:08] He watches
[23:10] and he knows what's best for me.
[23:18] The more I try, the better. He can mold
[23:25] me
[23:28] and change my life completely
[23:33] that it can fit his perfect way.
[23:40] That's just his way
[23:44] of telling me he loves me.
[23:51] It's a love beyond all human
[23:56] understanding.
[23:59] [Music]
[24:02] And I won't question trials
[24:07] that bring me to my knees. That's just
[24:12] his way
[24:14] of telling me he loves me.
[24:22] When I'm successful
[24:25] walking through this valley,
[24:32] he'll give me strength to climb the
[24:37] highest hill.
[24:43] My greatest strength comes through my
[24:47] darkest trials.
[24:49] [Music]
[24:53] And my greatest joy is knowing
[24:58] that he can trust in me.
[25:04] That's just his way
[25:08] of telling me he loves me.
[25:16] It's a love beyond all human
[25:21] understanding.
[25:26] And I won't question trials
[25:32] that bring me to my knees. That's just
[25:36] his way
[25:39] of telling me he loves me.
[25:45] That's just his way
[25:50] of telling me he loves me.
[25:57] It's a love beyond all human
[26:02] understanding.
[26:08] And I won't question trials
[26:13] that bring me to my knees. That's just
[26:18] his way
[26:20] of telling me he loves me.
[26:34] &gt;&gt; He loves you.
[26:35] &gt;&gt; Praise God.
[26:39] &gt;&gt; We're going to turn to the word at this
[26:40] time. And as brother Ed comes, let's
[26:43] turn on the screen to number 1053.
[26:46] Um,
[26:50] what key is this in? G. Okay. So, you
[26:54] can put on the screen afterwards so we
[26:55] know what key it's in. Man, so if you
[26:58] know it, you can sing it along with me.
[26:59] Amen.
[27:02] This road isn't easy all the time. Amen.
[27:05] But I'm thankful he's there with us
[27:06] every step of the way. Amen. Sing it.
[27:18] So many times I've questioned certain
[27:22] circumstances,
[27:25] things I could not understand.
[27:28] [Music]
[27:31] Anytime
[27:33] trials,
[27:35] weakness blurs my vision
[27:38] and my frustration gets so out of hand.
[27:45] Instead, I am reminded that I've never
[27:49] been forsaken
[27:52] and I've never had to stand one test
[27:55] alone.
[27:58] As I look at all the trials,
[28:02] the spirit rises up in me and it's
[28:06] through the fire my weakness is made
[28:09] strong.
[28:11] [Music]
[28:13] He never promised that would not get
[28:17] heavy and he would not be hard to
[28:26] he
[28:29] [Music]
[28:30] without
[28:33] [Music]
[28:41] standing
[28:42] in the valley
[28:46] and the adversary
[28:58] will He will take you through the fire
[29:02] again.
[29:07] I know within myself that I will surely
[29:11] perish.
[29:13] But if I trust my hand of God, his
[29:16] shield fl
[29:20] [Music]
[29:26] [Applause]
[29:29] [Music]
[29:30] [Applause]
[29:31] and he would not be hard.
[29:37] Well,
[29:39] he never
[29:48] [Music]
[30:04] Just
[30:08] show
[30:11] and he will take you through the fire
[30:14] again.
[30:19] He never promised that the cross would
[30:23] not be
[30:25] and he would not be
[30:28] [Music]
[30:31] will
[30:33] never
[30:35] our victory The mighty
[30:39] will always
[30:47] [Applause]
[30:50] [Music]
[31:02] show up willing. He will take you
[31:06] through the fire again.
[31:10] [Music]
[31:16] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[31:18] &gt;&gt; Well, we're glad for that promise
[31:21] &gt;&gt; and we're standing firm.
[31:24] &gt;&gt; He's the one we can hold on, but he's
[31:26] the one that's holding on to us.
[31:28] &gt;&gt; That's what's important. while you're
[31:31] standing and with the words of that
[31:34] course in our in our hearts and in our
[31:37] mouth and I trust in our soul as well.
[31:41] Uh we are remembering a young lady that
[31:44] was baptized here just about 3 weeks
[31:47] ago. Uh Sister Megan Williamson.
[31:52] And Megan uh is Silas's Silus O'Brien's
[31:56] girlfriend.
[31:58] And uh they really
[32:01] uh there's much that could be said about
[32:03] that. But um in fact is just a short
[32:08] time ago some time ago brother Silas
[32:11] I'll I'll go this far to say he felt
[32:14] that he wanted to so separate himself
[32:18] uh to to a relationship with Christ and
[32:22] he decided to just withdraw from
[32:27] uh the boyfriend girlfriend
[32:30] relationship which he and Megan were
[32:33] having and were experiencing and so it
[32:36] was something very very personal and I
[32:39] uh I I'm so hesitant to make as much
[32:43] very much public but he just felt to uh
[32:46] separate himself to his relationship
[32:49] with Christ and all of that you know
[32:52] through the days of the last month that
[32:55] we have spoken here in the congregation.
[32:58] And so when I said to you that he had
[33:02] taken steps, this was one of the major
[33:04] steps. And then uh he just felt that
[33:08] until God would supernaturally reveal
[33:13] himself to her and that she would feel
[33:16] within her own heart, not because of
[33:18] him, but because of her own God's
[33:21] dealing with her. And that's what
[33:23] happened about three weeks ago. She just
[33:26] decided that whatever went on in her
[33:29] heart, but she just said, "I'm going to
[33:31] go to the waters of baptism and and
[33:34] begin my life with Christ." But prior to
[33:37] that, she had been coming here to the
[33:39] church faithfully on her own, not with
[33:43] any not with any ulterior motive that
[33:46] that uh we were at all aware of, just on
[33:48] her own coming without support of uh
[33:52] other friends etc. except the young
[33:54] people who she knew. But she came here
[33:57] steady to the meetings for quite some
[34:00] time and then decided to be baptized.
[34:04] Megan was struck down with an aneurysm
[34:07] yesterday
[34:08] and uh was taken uh unconscious to uh
[34:12] the uh St. Joseph's Hospital and uh the
[34:16] family uh gathered there her father and
[34:20] he may be here this morning. uh brother
[34:22] Murray Williamson
[34:24] uh the mother was there and uh brother
[34:27] and sister O'Brien because she's been
[34:29] like a daughter to uh brother Roger and
[34:32] sister Michelle
[34:34] and so we began to pray of course and
[34:37] many were praying and she's been
[34:40] transferred now as of this morning to uh
[34:44] uh to the Vancouver General
[34:46] Hospital. I will just say this that uh
[34:49] she was in a very very critical
[34:51] condition.
[34:53] Uh but a nurse yesterday was uh last
[34:56] night I believe was changing the sheets
[34:59] and uh was with her and asked Megan open
[35:03] your eyes.
[35:05] And at this time you have to understand
[35:07] they've already performed a a a brain
[35:09] surgery just to determine exactly what
[35:12] their condition was. and uh and they
[35:17] have an induced coma.
[35:19] But they asked asked her to open her
[35:21] eyes and she opened her eyes. Then the
[35:24] nurse asked her, "Megan, if you can hear
[35:26] me, squeeze my hand." And she squeezed
[35:29] the nurse's hand. And then she said,
[35:32] "Can you wiggle your toes on both feet
[35:37] to see that both sides of the body were
[35:39] functioning?" And she wiggled her toes
[35:42] on both feet. And in that state, we are
[35:45] thankful. What I have prayed, I'd just
[35:47] like to let you know what I've been
[35:48] praying. I asked initially for God to
[35:52] cauterize the leak of that blood vessel.
[35:57] And uh so they are planning to do
[36:00] surgery, some surgery today. And uh we
[36:04] just want we want to bear her up. And I
[36:07] think of uh the the the
[36:11] paragraph, my wife loves it. Not that I
[36:14] don't, but she loves it as one she came
[36:16] across where brother Brandham simply
[36:18] said, "We bring her into your presence
[36:22] by prayer."
[36:24] &gt;&gt; I want you to think about that.
[36:26] &gt;&gt; That puts the onus on us and the
[36:29] privilege on us. We have that wonderful
[36:32] privilege to bring her into his
[36:35] presence.
[36:37] by prayer.
[36:39] &gt;&gt; So when we're praying now, I want you to
[36:42] be thinking of that every single person.
[36:44] I'm I'm uniting my heart in this one
[36:48] purpose to bring her into your presence
[36:52] by prayer. And he also has said in his
[36:56] presence, the supernatural is happening.
[37:01] &gt;&gt; You believe that, don't you? Amen. Says
[37:04] this is not an emotion. And this is a
[37:06] promise. Amen. So, we're wanting to just
[37:09] hold up now and bring our sister Megan.
[37:13] I said to her, "Father, I said
[37:18] she raised I watched her raise out of
[37:22] the waters of baptism with such a
[37:24] radiant face." And he said, "Mr.
[37:27] Episcopal.
[37:29] He said, "Megan has been a different
[37:31] girl since she's been coming to your
[37:34] church." Now, that is a that's the
[37:37] that's the kind of testimony you want to
[37:39] hear. Lifech changing, nature changing,
[37:43] reality changing God. Amen. So, we're
[37:47] just going to have prayer now.
[37:51] Oh loving heavenly father,
[37:54] you have invited us to come to come
[37:57] freely to make our petitions and our
[38:01] needs known before you. You have come oh
[38:04] God and told us to come and to bring not
[38:08] only our needs and our petitions but to
[38:11] bring our desires before you. And father
[38:14] today as this entire congregation and
[38:17] the invisible congregation that is not
[38:20] within this building but they are with
[38:21] us hearttoheart
[38:23] attribute to attribute. Their thoughts
[38:26] oh God have now blended with ours. This
[38:29] entire body of believers, this this part
[38:33] of the body bride of Jesus Christ is
[38:36] coming before you knowing, oh God, that
[38:39] you so loved that you gave your own son.
[38:43] You so loved us that you led him to
[38:46] Calvary. You so loved us, oh God, that
[38:49] you gave him as a sacrifice. And father,
[38:52] the blood of Jesus Christ cleanses us
[38:56] and by his stripes we are healed. We're
[39:00] bringing Megan Williamson, oh God. We're
[39:03] bearing her before you on our prayers,
[39:06] oh God, lifting her up before you,
[39:09] Father, while a surgeons and medical
[39:12] team do everything in their power. But
[39:15] we have been told by your messenger, you
[39:18] just begin where man ends his ability.
[39:22] Where man is finished, oh God, that's
[39:24] just where you're starting. Oh God, I
[39:27] pray that you'll take charge and and
[39:29] bring this entire need. Oh God, this
[39:32] physical need under your supreme
[39:35] control. And we know great physician
[39:38] that you are the greatest of all. The
[39:41] great physician that can cause bones
[39:44] that are deformed to become straight.
[39:47] You cause, oh God, the maimed and those
[39:49] with short legs to be lengthened. You do
[39:52] the supernatural. You can remove a bad
[39:55] thing and you can create, oh God, a new
[39:58] thing. I pray that you will just bring
[40:00] the whole circulatory system into its
[40:03] order, oh God, into its designed order,
[40:06] Father, and raise the girl that was
[40:09] raised up, oh God, out of these waters
[40:12] of baptism, let her rise, Father, to the
[40:15] glory of the name of Jesus Christ. And
[40:18] may may the testimony, Lord, of this
[40:21] message, I pray, be made just your name
[40:25] made great. Oh God, you're the only one
[40:27] that's worthy of praise. And so we thank
[40:30] you for that. And Father, as we're going
[40:32] to be coming now to the word, I pray
[40:35] that you will give us understanding.
[40:38] Lord, I pray you'll give us quiet
[40:40] spirits, reverent spirits. Father, may
[40:44] we just be in wrapped attention, dear
[40:46] Lord. Pray that you'll take, Father,
[40:48] these lips of clay and use them for your
[40:52] glory as an instrument. and may the word
[40:54] fall into good ground. I ask in Jesus
[40:58] Christ's name.
[41:00] Amen. Amen.
[41:03] Amen.
[41:05] I'd like you to join with me and sing in
[41:07] the presence of Jehovah.
[41:10] In the presence of Jehovah. That's where
[41:13] we are, friends. And if you don't sense
[41:16] that presence, just ask him, Lord,
[41:19] let it envelop me and draw me in.
[41:23] Make my heart ready now for your word
[41:26] and for your holy spirit in Jesus name.
[41:29] Would you help us brother Roberty?
[41:39] [Music]
[41:45] [Music]
[41:53] Praise the
[41:56] [Music]
[42:00] trance
[42:02] [Applause]
[42:05] [Music]
[42:14] [Music]
[42:21] the
[42:24] [Music]
[42:28] Amen. With that melody
[42:32] on our lips, I'd like you to turn to the
[42:35] word.
[42:41] I appreciate the body of Christ in a
[42:44] very special way. Uh I I may take this
[42:48] evening service as well. I'm going to
[42:50] see how far we get along this morning.
[42:53] Brother John has so graciously and I
[42:56] never asked a person to do this, but I
[42:58] asked him if he could be prepared in
[43:00] case I, you know, just don't feel led.
[43:04] He said, "You go right on." I said,
[43:05] "I'll be ready even if you just announce
[43:07] it during the service." So, here I am.
[43:10] He's my backup today. Thank you, brother
[43:13] John. He said, "Just to be relaxed." And
[43:16] I do. I feel very very relaxed and at
[43:19] peace about it. But we just want to see
[43:21] how far some of these subjects, you
[43:23] know, uh are things that have been
[43:26] pondered and things that God has dealt
[43:28] with a minister perhaps for years and
[43:32] then things more come more common and it
[43:35] it gets fit together and then during
[43:37] those years young people turn from 10
[43:40] years old to 20, you know, and what they
[43:44] grasped at 10 isn't what they're
[43:45] grasping at 15 and 18 and 20. Now we
[43:48] have young men and young ladies amongst
[43:50] us and need to hear some of these things
[43:52] that maybe you that have been here many
[43:54] years have heard before but now we want
[43:57] to hear it in a certain context. Last
[44:00] Sunday I spoke on the heavenly
[44:02] bridegroom created his own bride and I'm
[44:05] going to take part two of that. But the
[44:08] the title of the message does does not
[44:11] directly indicate the subject matter. uh
[44:14] only as we get into the subject matter
[44:16] can you see how it kind of begins to fit
[44:19] together. And that's why I say I may
[44:21] have to take this evening service. I I'm
[44:24] planning on doing so. So you just pray
[44:26] that God will give us strength. So I'm
[44:27] not going to carry a long long uh
[44:29] service this morning if I take this
[44:32] evening service as well. I'll have you
[44:35] turn with me to two readings. We're
[44:38] going to read Isaiah 9
[44:42] and verses 6 and 7.
[44:45] And then we'll be reading in Hebrews the
[44:48] 3 chapter.
[44:57] All right. In he in Isaiah 9, for unto
[45:02] us, verse six, unto us a child is born,
[45:07] unto us a son is given,
[45:10] and the government shall be upon his
[45:14] shoulders,
[45:17] upon his shoulder. and his name shall be
[45:20] called wonderful counselor,
[45:23] the mighty God, the everlasting father,
[45:27] the prince of peace. Of the increase of
[45:31] his government
[45:33] and peace
[45:35] there shall be no end.
[45:40] uh upon the throne of David and upon his
[45:44] kingdom to order it and to establish it
[45:47] with judgment and with justice. From
[45:50] hence even forever the zeal of the Lord
[45:54] of hosts will perform this.
[45:58] In Hebrews the 3 chapter,
[46:02] "Wherefore, holy brethren, partakers of
[46:05] the heavenly calling, consider the
[46:08] apostle and high priest of our
[46:10] profession, Jesus Christ,
[46:13] Christ Jesus, who was faithful to him
[46:16] that appointed him,
[46:19] as also Moses was faithful in all his
[46:22] house. For this man was counted worthy
[46:25] of more glory than Moses, in as much as
[46:29] he who hath built the house hath more
[46:32] honor than the house. For every house is
[46:35] builded by some man, but he that built
[46:38] all things is God. Amen.
[46:41] &gt;&gt; God bless you. You may be seated. Now,
[46:44] whoever has the slides on in front of
[46:46] me, they can please take it off. It's
[46:49] distracting.
[46:52] They're trying to tell me I forgot
[46:54] something, but I didn't. They just don't
[46:56] know. I had already looked after it.
[46:59] [Laughter]
[47:02] Amen. For unto us a child is born, and
[47:05] unto us a son is given,
[47:08] and the government
[47:11] shall be upon his shoulder. Now I want
[47:15] to speak uh considerable time this
[47:18] morning on uh on the subject of of of
[47:21] the government said now the title of the
[47:24] message is that God the heavenly
[47:28] bridegroom created his own bride and
[47:30] that's exactly right. Uh but as and I
[47:34] went last Sunday I I paged my way
[47:38] through the Old Testament saying God was
[47:42] making his son. He was making you
[47:44] remember that God was making a son. Then
[47:47] into the New Testament, God was making
[47:49] his bride, his wife now for that son.
[47:53] But when the when when the son came,
[47:56] the son was under
[47:59] uh he was under a certain administration
[48:02] that was there present. He there was the
[48:06] laws of the the Jewish order. There was
[48:10] the laws of Rome. Uh there were certain
[48:14] taxes to be paid and that's even when he
[48:17] was born they had to go where they went
[48:20] because taxes there was a certain
[48:21] administration in place and they were
[48:24] subject to that and Jesus grew up under
[48:27] that administration and there were
[48:29] certain regulations and things that
[48:32] continued. They had the Passover at a
[48:34] certain time. They kept their certain
[48:36] celebrations and and various things. And
[48:39] Jesus, he he lived live lived subject to
[48:42] those things. And so now the bride of
[48:46] Jesus Christ, well, let me just back up
[48:48] a moment and say although Jesus lived
[48:51] subject to the laws of the land, he was
[48:54] not a lawb breakaker. But bey be beyond
[48:58] that and there was another kingdom.
[49:01] There was another realm which he was
[49:04] subject to and it is the realm of of it
[49:07] was the realm of God. It was the realm
[49:09] of the supernatural. Brother Brandham
[49:11] said he lived in a world of his own and
[49:14] he was subject to that. I mean when he
[49:16] was being led and directed, he must
[49:19] needs go to Samaria or he must needs go
[49:22] to a certain place because he must needs
[49:24] me to certain person that was not
[49:27] directed by Rome or by Judaism. That was
[49:31] being directed by another kingdom,
[49:34] another realm. And so the bride of Jesus
[49:37] Christ, we live in, we've been brought
[49:41] to this particular time and moment in
[49:44] time. And we come from different
[49:46] countries. We come from different
[49:48] backgrounds. And the nations that or the
[49:51] country that you came from originally
[49:53] and are presently living in, they have
[49:56] their own uh they have their own set of
[50:00] laws, their constitution. Uh they have
[50:03] their regulations. Then if you live in a
[50:06] certain city or a town or a village or a
[50:09] municipality wherever you live there are
[50:12] certain requirements which are made upon
[50:14] the citizens and we must abide by we are
[50:17] called upon to abide by those. So we get
[50:20] the point. But now within these
[50:22] governments and within uh within this
[50:25] natural realm there are men and people
[50:30] men and are individuals who are either
[50:34] elected or appointed to administer the
[50:39] what the governing body or the
[50:42] government decides is important and what
[50:45] they what their party plan is. They have
[50:48] been ordained. They've been ordained to
[50:52] come and do this thing and to administer
[50:55] it to the to the people. And so that I
[50:59] want to talk about this administration
[51:02] now. Uh
[51:05] have you you've got that point? That's
[51:08] that's important for me. Now and also
[51:11] one blends into the other.
[51:15] uh there is a it it's not like uh one
[51:20] age or one period just cuts off at we
[51:23] say well at a certain point in time
[51:25] midnight tonight this one is over and
[51:27] the next one comes into being uh even
[51:31] when governments change there's a period
[51:34] when uh there's an overlapping and uh
[51:37] the new government or the new party with
[51:41] their new uh platform with their main
[51:44] program they have to come but they just
[51:46] can't start it like that and the other
[51:48] one just can't end like that one has to
[51:50] blend into the other and so it is also
[51:53] in the scripture of the seven church
[51:55] ages and brother Brandham talks about it
[51:58] how they are they overlap one age into
[52:01] the other and so I would like to just uh
[52:04] let allow me to read uh just a wee bit
[52:06] which gives a uh I think a real good
[52:09] clear understanding of that because it's
[52:11] a it's a critical point in this in the
[52:14] service this morning said in order to
[52:17] understand the wealth of meaning
[52:19] involved in behold I set before you an
[52:23] open door and no man can shut it. That's
[52:26] the the scripture spoken to the
[52:29] Philadelphiaian church age. He said we
[52:31] must now recall what has been said about
[52:35] each age running over into another age.
[52:39] there is an overlapping or a melting or
[52:43] fading into rather than an abrupt end
[52:47] and a clear start. I want you to listen
[52:50] very very closely to this because I want
[52:52] to make a statement when we're when
[52:53] we're done done reading this paragraph.
[52:56] He said, "This age particularly flows
[52:59] into the next age." And not only does
[53:01] this age overflow into the last age, but
[53:05] the last age is in many respects simply
[53:09] a carrying on of the sixth age. And the
[53:12] seventh age, a very short age, that's
[53:14] the Leodysian age. A very short age
[53:18] gathers up into itself
[53:21] for one quick work all the evil of every
[53:26] age and all the reality of Pentecost.
[53:32] &gt;&gt; Once the Philadelphiaian age was about
[53:34] to run its course, the Leodysian age
[53:37] quickly comes in bringing both the tears
[53:39] and the wheat to harvest. And so now
[53:43] once again we have a duplicity uh a dual
[53:47] happening here. We have uh we have the
[53:50] evil as I was preaching last Sunday that
[53:54] the one is uh one the the the whole body
[53:59] or the whole movement of evil is
[54:03] increasing into a state of disorder.
[54:07] And in the midst of the disorder, in the
[54:09] midst of that disorder, God is bringing
[54:13] to his uh final conclusion and he's
[54:16] bringing an order to the body of
[54:19] believers. He's building a bride, a body
[54:23] of Jesus Christ. In the midst of evil,
[54:26] he's bringing purity. In the midst of
[54:29] disorder, he's bringing order. in the
[54:32] midst of evil and all every unclean
[54:34] thing. He's bringing forth not only
[54:37] purity but holiness until he will say
[54:40] that she's a church without spot or
[54:43] wrinkle or any such thing.
[54:47] &gt;&gt; Isn't that the promise of God?
[54:49] &gt;&gt; But the same word of God says that the
[54:51] things in the world will wax worse and
[54:54] worse.
[54:55] &gt;&gt; Is that so?
[54:56] &gt;&gt; Do you see that happening? And so then I
[54:58] will say that we have we have a a a a
[55:02] duel happening right now. You are living
[55:04] in it. You contact it every day. And
[55:07] that is a world system. Remember this is
[55:11] according to the scripture Satan's Eden.
[55:14] &gt;&gt; And Satan's Eden cannot be a an order of
[55:18] righteousness. It's an order of
[55:20] unrighteousness.
[55:22] &gt;&gt; It's something that is coming into
[55:24] disorder. If these are the days which
[55:27] are prophesied to be the days of Sodom
[55:29] and the days of Noah. In the days of
[55:32] Noah, the earth was filled with
[55:35] violence. That does not sound like order
[55:37] to me.
[55:38] &gt;&gt; That sounds like utter disorder.
[55:41] &gt;&gt; That sounds like chaos to me. That
[55:43] sounds like darkness and confusion to
[55:45] me. And we are not a part of that
[55:48] darkness and confusion. We are coming
[55:51] into the order. And the only thing that
[55:53] can bring divine order is a divine
[55:55] spoken word of God.
[55:57] &gt;&gt; There's no other way to come to order.
[56:01] &gt;&gt; And so that is the state. And now what
[56:04] we have, if you are listening real
[56:07] closely, I personally believe this world
[56:12] is being fitted for
[56:14] not only destruction but tribulation.
[56:18] And I believe that the elements of
[56:21] tribulation are set in motion now.
[56:26] &gt;&gt; And that is why, not to be negative, I'm
[56:29] a very optimistic person.
[56:31] &gt;&gt; But in the midst of this world is being
[56:34] fitted for destruction, being fitted for
[56:39] judgment, being fitted for, and the fact
[56:42] is it's moving in to it. It's in the
[56:46] it's in the beginning stages of the
[56:49] tribulation.
[56:51] &gt;&gt; In fact is if God withdraws as he has
[56:54] said he would withdraws his holy spirit
[56:57] withdraws his righteous or the exodus
[57:00] people his elected or appointed ones
[57:03] withdraws them from this world you'll
[57:05] see the you'll see the mess that Satan
[57:07] has created.
[57:08] &gt;&gt; And I say we don't want to see that. We
[57:11] don't want to be a part of it. I don't
[57:12] want to be here to view it. Amen. Right.
[57:15] &gt;&gt; And so while that is happening, I
[57:17] believe also the elements of the
[57:20] millennium
[57:21] &gt;&gt; are in place.
[57:23] &gt;&gt; Like the elements of evil, so are the
[57:26] elements of righteousness going side by
[57:28] side. The kingdom of this world and the
[57:30] kingdom of God. The tribulation on its
[57:33] way in and the millennium on its way in
[57:35] also.
[57:37] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[57:38] &gt;&gt; And the prince of peace shall surely
[57:40] rule. The government is on his shoulder.
[57:44] That's the government I want to speak
[57:47] about
[57:48] &gt;&gt; because in every government in every
[57:50] government there are those appointed
[57:52] ones who are ordained or appointed or
[57:55] elected even in the world and we're are
[57:58] familiar with those terms and I'm trying
[58:00] to use terms that you are familiar with
[58:03] to bring it into the spiritual uh
[58:05] scenario because within the spiritual
[58:08] realm within the natural realm we have
[58:10] those that are elected and appointed. In
[58:12] the spiritual realm, we have those that
[58:14] are elected and appointed.
[58:17] &gt;&gt; And the Bible says, now you can go back
[58:19] and see how these how these ser services
[58:22] are tying together.
[58:25] What might we do that we can do the
[58:27] works of God? Jesus said, "Believe on
[58:31] him
[58:32] &gt;&gt; whom God hath sent."
[58:34] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[58:35] &gt;&gt; Is the work of God. if you believe on
[58:37] him because it's not man who has elected
[58:41] a certain man or a certain person or a
[58:44] certain people or a certain party to be
[58:46] in control. It is now God says I'll do
[58:49] it.
[58:51] &gt;&gt; I'll do the choosing. Thank you very
[58:53] much.
[58:54] &gt;&gt; I'll choose whoever I wish.
[58:57] &gt;&gt; I'll choose a man that perhaps you don't
[58:59] think is prepared for the job, but I
[59:02] will endow him. I will endow those
[59:05] people. You may not feel that you're
[59:07] capable to carry the testimony that God
[59:10] has uh has has ordained us to carry, but
[59:13] I can assure you God does not give us a
[59:16] task to fulfill without giving us the
[59:19] power and the authority
[59:22] &gt;&gt; and the necessary equipment to fulfill
[59:25] the job.
[59:27] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[59:30] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[59:30] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[59:32] And so to believe on him whom God hath
[59:36] sent, the authorities of this land, we
[59:40] have and a very specific departments.
[59:44] And I'm going to speak a great deal
[59:45] about the offices. We have the
[59:48] department of finance.
[59:50] We have the department of defense.
[59:53] We have the department of of of of parks
[59:56] and and uh uh you know those those
[1:00:00] things that control the the environment.
[1:00:03] We have all different departments. We
[1:00:05] have the department of fisheries, the
[1:00:08] department of lands and forests. We have
[1:00:11] the department of natural resources
[1:00:15] &gt;&gt; and the and and the department of
[1:00:17] justice. Now, if you have a financial
[1:00:19] matter, it is just fruitless to go and
[1:00:23] say, "But I want to intreat the
[1:00:25] Department of Justice on this financial
[1:00:27] matter." I said, "You're in the wrong
[1:00:29] department." Or, "I've got a problem
[1:00:31] with the with the income tax department.
[1:00:34] I want to talk to a Supreme Court judge
[1:00:37] or I want to talk to the lands of, you
[1:00:39] know, the parks and the forest to say,
[1:00:41] "You're in the wrong department. We deal
[1:00:43] with trees. We don't know anything about
[1:00:45] income tax." Amen.
[1:00:47] &gt;&gt; You getting my point?
[1:00:49] &gt;&gt; And God has appointed,
[1:00:52] he has elected that there will be
[1:00:54] prophets and apostles
[1:00:56] &gt;&gt; and they shall be the foundation and
[1:00:58] that you can't do anything about it.
[1:01:00] That happens to be the department and
[1:01:02] the offices that control those things.
[1:01:05] &gt;&gt; And God has pastors and he has
[1:01:07] evangelists. He has teachers. He has
[1:01:10] apostles. He has prophets. He has all of
[1:01:12] these. He's put them into place. He had
[1:01:14] a Moses. And believe it or not, Moses
[1:01:16] was not just for the Jews and the
[1:01:19] Hebrews that lived at that time. The
[1:01:21] words that God spoke through Moses have
[1:01:23] run through have run through the ages
[1:01:26] and have power and are effective even
[1:01:27] today. And that has been upon billions
[1:01:30] and billions and billions of people. And
[1:01:33] you say, you mean that one man, one man
[1:01:36] has uh is going to have an effect upon
[1:01:39] billions of people? That's God's
[1:01:40] choosing.
[1:01:42] That's God's doing.
[1:01:43] &gt;&gt; And then we might bring it down and say,
[1:01:45] "Are you trying to infer that there's a
[1:01:48] handful of people that have believed on
[1:01:50] him who God sent and in this end time
[1:01:53] that there's a small group of people
[1:01:55] that's called the bride of Jesus Christ
[1:01:57] and that she has a certain status above
[1:02:00] any other uh who even uh who even have
[1:02:03] some testimony or some claim on the
[1:02:05] cross or claim of Easter or claim of the
[1:02:07] resurrection that happens to be the
[1:02:09] truth of God's word.
[1:02:10] &gt;&gt; Amen. God chooses whoever they are. I
[1:02:13] don't know who they all are,
[1:02:15] &gt;&gt; but God knows every single one of them.
[1:02:17] And I can tell you one thing. How do you
[1:02:19] identify them as opposed to anyone else?
[1:02:22] They have to believe on him whom God
[1:02:25] have sent.
[1:02:27] &gt;&gt; Now tell me that that pillar of fire
[1:02:30] that was with William Brandoms of the
[1:02:31] devil.
[1:02:33] &gt;&gt; Now tell me, come forward and tell me
[1:02:35] that that was not of God. Tell me when
[1:02:38] he stood there and said that you come
[1:02:40] from a certain place. You don't come
[1:02:41] from this city. You come I see you
[1:02:43] traveling from the east coming west and
[1:02:45] you have a you you are going to see your
[1:02:47] daughter and in fact there's a letter
[1:02:49] from hers in your purse. Tell me that's
[1:02:51] of the devil.
[1:02:53] That's not of the devil.
[1:02:55] &gt;&gt; That's God. How does that happen time
[1:02:58] and time and time and again? So then I
[1:03:00] asked the question that's that's not
[1:03:02] like Pentecost called oh some little
[1:03:04] gift or something. That has nothing to
[1:03:05] do with the gift. This is a special
[1:03:07] endowment to identify him whom God has
[1:03:10] sent. God is trying to tell a blind
[1:03:12] world, open your eyes.
[1:03:16] &gt;&gt; And now I ask another question. What
[1:03:19] kind of administration? What is that to
[1:03:22] administrate?
[1:03:23] What is the administration?
[1:03:26] What what is that? What kind of effect
[1:03:28] is that to have?
[1:03:30] What is it to do? Primarily, it's to
[1:03:33] bring you to be a believer of the word.
[1:03:36] to believe the word in its fullness and
[1:03:39] in its strength
[1:03:41] &gt;&gt; and to believe on him whom God has sent.
[1:03:45] &gt;&gt; I believe that God sent you. That's just
[1:03:47] how how much I believe it.
[1:03:50] &gt;&gt; I believe that God has sent you to a
[1:03:53] specific place maybe where you work
[1:03:56] &gt;&gt; or where you live or where you shop.
[1:04:00] Maybe even do you know that
[1:04:02] administration is in effect today? Right
[1:04:04] while you're sitting here, the
[1:04:05] government is in an effective
[1:04:07] administration. Do you know that there
[1:04:09] are people working on your behalf? It's
[1:04:11] not just that there are laws. It's not
[1:04:13] just that. There are benefits.
[1:04:16] &gt;&gt; There's wonderful benefits.
[1:04:18] &gt;&gt; Do you know that we have a certain
[1:04:19] freedom? We're sitting here in a perfect
[1:04:21] freedom. You could go into some
[1:04:23] countries where they have a law in place
[1:04:25] and they have the people administrating
[1:04:27] it and they have the they have the
[1:04:29] police and whoever else they if if you
[1:04:32] try to have this kind of gathering in
[1:04:33] some places I know they shut you down
[1:04:35] real quick
[1:04:36] &gt;&gt; because they don't only have the law in
[1:04:38] place they have the people to affect it.
[1:04:41] &gt;&gt; But here in this country we happen to
[1:04:43] have the freedom. We can gather like
[1:04:45] this and that we just take it for
[1:04:47] granted because this is where we live
[1:04:49] and we have people that protect us. And
[1:04:51] I'm happy for that freedom.
[1:04:53] &gt;&gt; Aren't you?
[1:04:54] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:04:55] &gt;&gt; I'm happy that I can say, "Praise the
[1:04:57] Lord." I'm happy I can go out on the
[1:04:59] street and cry my lungs out if I want
[1:05:01] to. Thank God
[1:05:03] &gt;&gt; and nobody can stop me
[1:05:05] &gt;&gt; cuz we're in a free land. Express
[1:05:07] yourself.
[1:05:09] [Applause]
[1:05:11] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:05:13] &gt;&gt; That's just the kind of place it is. But
[1:05:16] in the spiritual realm, because we're
[1:05:18] not just in the natural, in the
[1:05:19] spiritual realm, I'd like to make the
[1:05:22] congregation more conscious because
[1:05:25] we're a very materially and
[1:05:27] materialistic generation and age. I
[1:05:30] think we need to be more conscious of
[1:05:32] the invisible, of the other dimension,
[1:05:34] of the other realm. And that is why I'm
[1:05:37] intrigued. I'm not only intrigued, I'm
[1:05:40] very keenly interested. I have been
[1:05:42] impacted. My life has been changed when
[1:05:45] I met the prophet of God and saw
[1:05:49] and heard said now that's the angel of
[1:05:52] the Lord.
[1:05:55] &gt;&gt; That is the Lord Jesus Christ.
[1:05:58] &gt;&gt; That is the Holy Spirit.
[1:06:00] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:06:01] &gt;&gt; I tell you what, I had an awe.
[1:06:05] I was impacted from a young man and I'm
[1:06:09] more impacted today
[1:06:11] &gt;&gt; than I was then
[1:06:13] &gt;&gt; because now I realize
[1:06:16] this this one this one that was in
[1:06:20] another realm. Well, he would say, "Can
[1:06:23] you see that?" I couldn't see that. But
[1:06:25] I knew that it was true because he said,
[1:06:27] "Now it's it's over a man. It's over
[1:06:30] this woman." And this is exactly why
[1:06:33] you're here. To think that the
[1:06:35] compassionate high priest in another
[1:06:38] realm is administrating the power of
[1:06:42] another kingdom upon the people, us poor
[1:06:45] people. Oh, and so find that sinners
[1:06:49] come and waited down with sin and heard
[1:06:52] him speak the other day. Now you're the
[1:06:55] thing that is troubling you is you're
[1:06:57] not a Christian. You're holding a baby,
[1:06:59] said a young woman. You're holding a
[1:07:01] baby and you want the baby, but he says
[1:07:03] the big thing is you're not saved.
[1:07:06] You're not a Christian. Oh,
[1:07:08] administration coming from another
[1:07:11] realm, from an invisible realm, coming
[1:07:14] and meeting these poor individuals are
[1:07:16] here, lost and not knowing which way to
[1:07:18] go, solving our solution, answering our
[1:07:21] questions. That same Holy Spirit is
[1:07:23] present right now. Yeah.
[1:07:27] &gt;&gt; But for us to think that just some kind
[1:07:30] of loosey goosey and anybody has access,
[1:07:33] there's nothing in the Bible that says
[1:07:34] that.
[1:07:36] &gt;&gt; You might say, "Well, whosoever will may
[1:07:38] come." That's right. Come.
[1:07:41] &gt;&gt; Come God's way.
[1:07:42] &gt;&gt; Come believe on God's plan.
[1:07:44] &gt;&gt; Come and believe God's program. And you
[1:07:47] do have access to it. Right?
[1:07:51] &gt;&gt; People don't like that. But that happens
[1:07:53] to be. I tell you what, you know, you go
[1:07:56] and build a house here in Siri or build
[1:07:58] a house in your district and and and and
[1:08:01] then when you want to hook onto the
[1:08:02] water, just say, "Oh, no, no, no, no,
[1:08:04] no. I'm living in a free country. I want
[1:08:07] a pipeline direct to the reservoir.
[1:08:10] I want my own line. I don't want to hook
[1:08:13] up to this system that you got in place.
[1:08:15] I don't believe in this system. I don't
[1:08:17] believe in any system. I want my own
[1:08:19] line.
[1:08:20] &gt;&gt; You know what'll happen to you? Your
[1:08:22] faucet will be dry.
[1:08:24] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:08:24] &gt;&gt; You won't have any water.
[1:08:26] &gt;&gt; Because you're either going to come with
[1:08:28] the with the the system of the city and
[1:08:31] that happens to be what's in place.
[1:08:33] Well, God happens to have a system in
[1:08:34] place, friends.
[1:08:36] &gt;&gt; He has apostles and prophets who's the
[1:08:38] foundation of the church and it's built
[1:08:40] upon them and there's nothing else you
[1:08:42] can do about it.
[1:08:47] Well, here I am preaching and I haven't
[1:08:48] even started.
[1:08:59] Now I want to talk about the body.
[1:09:03] The bride of Jesus Christ. The church of
[1:09:07] God is called a number of things.
[1:09:12] It's called the bride of Christ. It's
[1:09:14] called the body of Christ.
[1:09:17] It's called a holy nation.
[1:09:21] Now, when we think of the body of
[1:09:22] Christ, we think of a church.
[1:09:25] And it can be that. It's also called a
[1:09:27] spotless church.
[1:09:30] &gt;&gt; It's called the new Jerusalem.
[1:09:34] &gt;&gt; It's called a holy nation.
[1:09:37] &gt;&gt; It's called the habitation of God. And
[1:09:40] all of those have reference direct
[1:09:42] reference
[1:09:45] to us as a group.
[1:09:47] &gt;&gt; So on one hand we can see ourselves as a
[1:09:50] collective body. On another hand we can
[1:09:52] see ourselves as an individual within
[1:09:55] that body and nothing really changes.
[1:09:57] The body in a corporate manner is called
[1:10:01] a bride of Jesus Christ. It is also
[1:10:03] called a masterpiece.
[1:10:06] But you as an individual must be a
[1:10:08] masterpiece within that corporate body.
[1:10:11] Because if you are not a masterpiece,
[1:10:13] then the whole body can't be a
[1:10:14] masterpiece.
[1:10:16] Each individual must be a masterpiece.
[1:10:20] &gt;&gt; And this is something if we could get to
[1:10:22] unity on this one point, it would make a
[1:10:26] great effect, a great change in the
[1:10:29] atmosphere. It would make a great change
[1:10:32] in the answer to our prayers if we had
[1:10:34] every person every person identified
[1:10:38] down the roads of this congregation and
[1:10:41] and every single person within the sound
[1:10:44] of my voice could say with a truth and a
[1:10:48] w with a a confirmation and assurance
[1:10:51] within their heart by the grace of God
[1:10:55] by the work of God by his sovereign work
[1:10:58] in my life I am a masterpiece of his
[1:11:02] handiwork.
[1:11:04] &gt;&gt; See, even even the amen was weak.
[1:11:13] &gt;&gt; See, that's where it gets if we if we
[1:11:15] always say, "Oh, the body of Jesus
[1:11:17] Christ, worldwide, wonderful body."
[1:11:19] People say, "Amen."
[1:11:23] Then we say within a congregation,
[1:11:25] within a church, and it's a body of
[1:11:27] Jesus Christ, bloodbought, spotless,
[1:11:30] without any any wrinkle or any such
[1:11:32] thing. Say amen.
[1:11:34] And now we want to bring it home.
[1:11:37] &gt;&gt; Say, what about you as an individual?
[1:11:40] &gt;&gt; Say, well, I can say amen for somebody
[1:11:42] else. I could say amen for the world and
[1:11:44] amen for a whole church, but I have a
[1:11:46] tough time saying amen for me.
[1:11:49] See even that is a downer.
[1:11:53] &gt;&gt; See how negative we are.
[1:11:57] &gt;&gt; It's not saying that you have achieved
[1:12:00] some great thing. It's saying that he
[1:12:02] has achieved it.
[1:12:05] &gt;&gt; We say we are a masterpiece because
[1:12:08] Jesus first paid for it.
[1:12:10] &gt;&gt; He bought it. And if we if we cringe
[1:12:14] from that, if we diminish from that,
[1:12:18] then we take away from the effect of his
[1:12:20] sacrifice at Calvary. We're saying,
[1:12:23] well, it was a great sacrifice, but how
[1:12:25] somehow not sufficient enough to make me
[1:12:28] a masterpiece.
[1:12:31] &gt;&gt; The bride of Jesus Christ is a
[1:12:33] masterpiece. She's a glorious church
[1:12:36] without spot or wrinkle. She is the new
[1:12:38] Jerusalem with the light of the lamb in
[1:12:41] her.
[1:12:43] &gt;&gt; That's what this book says.
[1:12:45] &gt;&gt; And now we want to agree with what it
[1:12:47] says.
[1:12:48] &gt;&gt; And you want to repeat the same thing.
[1:12:51] You want to say what it says. It is a
[1:12:53] glorious church. I'm part of that
[1:12:55] church. I'm part of the glorious church
[1:12:57] without spot or wrinkle or any such
[1:13:00] thing. That's what this book says.
[1:13:05] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:13:08] every person right away, we tend to look
[1:13:11] at our frailties or our failures and
[1:13:13] whatever more. And I'm not trying to get
[1:13:14] your uh not not trying to get you to
[1:13:17] deny that, but I'm trying to get you to
[1:13:20] agree with the word of God and let God
[1:13:22] look after the frailty.
[1:13:26] &gt;&gt; You you've got to look after my frailty.
[1:13:29] You have to look after If you don't do
[1:13:31] it, it can't happen.
[1:13:33] &gt;&gt; I can't do it on my own. And if I did it
[1:13:35] on my own, what glory would that get
[1:13:38] him? Say, "Send the Holy Spirit." If you
[1:13:40] need a cleansing, just call on him and
[1:13:42] believe him to do the cleansing right
[1:13:45] now. You need some molding. You need
[1:13:47] some transforming power in your life.
[1:13:49] You can't generate it. Just say, "God,
[1:13:52] you come and do it." Amen.
[1:13:56] &gt;&gt; Sometime people wait for years, months
[1:13:59] or years to be baptized because they
[1:14:01] want to get themselves in a state of
[1:14:02] perfection before they're baptized.
[1:14:04] Forget it.
[1:14:06] &gt;&gt; Even if you could get yourself to a
[1:14:08] state, who says God's going to accept
[1:14:09] that?
[1:14:10] &gt;&gt; So, well, I did it. I quit. Not saying
[1:14:14] that we shouldn't have that resolve, but
[1:14:17] if you mean business with God, if you
[1:14:19] really mean business with God, I can
[1:14:21] tell you God's got the system in place
[1:14:24] &gt;&gt; to bring upon and bring effective in
[1:14:27] your life everything that we have need
[1:14:29] of.
[1:14:30] &gt;&gt; Do you believe that?
[1:14:32] &gt;&gt; This is a wonderful government.
[1:14:35] &gt;&gt; The government's on his shoulder.
[1:14:37] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. It's a government that's
[1:14:39] increasing. Amen.
[1:14:40] &gt;&gt; It's a government increasing in its
[1:14:42] order.
[1:14:43] &gt;&gt; It's increasing in its peace.
[1:14:46] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:14:50] &gt;&gt; And this is the house that Christ built.
[1:14:54] &gt;&gt; And it says this, Ephesians, in whom ye
[1:14:58] also are builded together. I wonder if
[1:15:01] we can say amen to that. In whom ye
[1:15:06] &gt;&gt; in whom you
[1:15:08] &gt;&gt; Yes, me. Yes,
[1:15:10] &gt;&gt; you believe that
[1:15:12] &gt;&gt; in whom I
[1:15:14] &gt;&gt; am builded together
[1:15:16] &gt;&gt; for inhabitation of God
[1:15:18] &gt;&gt; through the spirit. Would you agree with
[1:15:21] this? Apostle Paul's writing
[1:15:24] &gt;&gt; 100%. I'm trying to get total agreement
[1:15:27] here.
[1:15:30] &gt;&gt; See, I don't need your excitement. I
[1:15:32] need your agreement.
[1:15:33] &gt;&gt; I just want you to say yay and amen to
[1:15:36] the word. Amen.
[1:15:38] &gt;&gt; And then he goes on in the Corinthians,
[1:15:40] he says, "What know ye not that your
[1:15:42] body is a temple of the Holy Ghost which
[1:15:46] is in you which you have of God and you
[1:15:50] are not your own?" These are powerful.
[1:15:53] &gt;&gt; Your temple always saying, "Ah, I know
[1:15:55] that I'm a temple and so on so forth." I
[1:15:57] want you to re I want you to experience
[1:16:00] it. I want you to express it. I want you
[1:16:03] to especially confess it.
[1:16:06] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[1:16:07] &gt;&gt; If you're here and may you may well be
[1:16:09] here that are not filled with this Holy
[1:16:12] Spirit. And remember the Holy Spirit
[1:16:14] will never deny the word that he's the
[1:16:16] author of
[1:16:21] &gt;&gt; never.
[1:16:22] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:16:22] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:16:23] &gt;&gt; And your body is the temple of the Holy
[1:16:26] Ghost which you have
[1:16:28] in you which is in you which you have of
[1:16:32] God and you are not your own. Amen.
[1:16:35] &gt;&gt; And then 1 Corinthians 3:9, for we are
[1:16:38] laborers together with God.
[1:16:41] &gt;&gt; So we're all laborers together,
[1:16:43] &gt;&gt; not just a ministry. We are laborers
[1:16:45] together.
[1:16:47] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:16:48] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:16:49] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:16:50] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:16:50] &gt;&gt; I didn't witness to Megan.
[1:16:53] I never had an opportunity to witness to
[1:16:55] her, but somebody ministered to her.
[1:16:58] &gt;&gt; She was at youth camp.
[1:17:00] &gt;&gt; Brother Burley Williams ministered to
[1:17:02] her. I'm sure the O'Brien family has
[1:17:05] ministered to her. Somebody witnessed to
[1:17:08] her.
[1:17:11] &gt;&gt; I thank God for that witness.
[1:17:14] [Music]
[1:17:15] &gt;&gt; I thank God I'm in support of. There's a
[1:17:18] lot of people that are here who've come
[1:17:20] to the new birth that I didn't witness
[1:17:22] to or maybe didn't hear a sermon that I
[1:17:24] or anybody else preached behind this
[1:17:26] pulpit, but somebody spoke to them.
[1:17:28] Somebody handed them a book.
[1:17:31] Somebody handed them maybe a tape or
[1:17:33] whatever more.
[1:17:34] &gt;&gt; And a lot of you young people are here
[1:17:36] because you've heard through your
[1:17:38] parents, dedicated parents guiding. What
[1:17:42] a wonderful thing. And you've heard it
[1:17:44] again and again. It's it's it's
[1:17:46] incumbent upon you to to this morning to
[1:17:50] receive this message that that is not
[1:17:54] just my parent or my friend or someone I
[1:17:57] know or my associate or somebody I'm
[1:18:00] working with that happens to be part of
[1:18:02] this mechanism called the administration
[1:18:06] of the Holy Spirit that is being
[1:18:09] effective from an unseen realm and
[1:18:12] coming down into the visible realm and
[1:18:14] having effect in moving someone to speak
[1:18:17] out of their mouth words of life.
[1:18:21] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:18:30] &gt;&gt; And it's important to realize
[1:18:33] in fact as I I come here to the pulpit
[1:18:35] this morning I would have sooner been
[1:18:39] maybe someplace
[1:18:40] just having my feet up.
[1:18:44] But I I I feel I am I'm a duty bound.
[1:18:47] And furthermore, I'm not going to cower
[1:18:51] or back away from what I really believe.
[1:18:54] I believe I'm commissioned to be here
[1:18:56] tomorrow morning this morning and to say
[1:18:59] these very things.
[1:19:00] &gt;&gt; I didn't have everything all set up and
[1:19:02] planned. I just say, "God, you take
[1:19:04] order of the things. I feel this in my
[1:19:07] heart. I feel the burden of the word of
[1:19:08] the Lord. You put it together in a
[1:19:10] structure. You say to the people what
[1:19:13] needs to be said. I don't know who all
[1:19:14] is out there. I don't know who all is
[1:19:16] listening, but you know exactly who's
[1:19:18] listening and exactly what they need to
[1:19:20] hear. It's up to you to pick up that
[1:19:22] nugget.
[1:19:23] &gt;&gt; It's up to you to pick up that thing
[1:19:25] that God has for you. I can guarantee it
[1:19:28] will be here in this service because God
[1:19:30] is not a God of accidents. This isn't
[1:19:33] just some great gathering of happens.
[1:19:36] You're here by divine
[1:19:38] by divine order of God. Hallelujah.
[1:19:42] &gt;&gt; I believe that.
[1:19:44] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:19:44] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:19:48] &gt;&gt; So, you are God's building. We're
[1:19:50] laborers together. And you are God's
[1:19:53] husbandry. 1 Corinthians 3:9. And you
[1:19:57] are God's building.
[1:20:01] &gt;&gt; Like this congregation to say, "I am
[1:20:04] God's building."
[1:20:08] &gt;&gt; We say it together. I am God's building.
[1:20:12] Now, that has a two-fold meaning.
[1:20:14] Doesn't just mean I am God's house, but
[1:20:18] I am the I am the result of God's work.
[1:20:23] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:20:24] &gt;&gt; Both of those things.
[1:20:26] &gt;&gt; And if God has been building you, then
[1:20:29] he intends to own you and inhabit you.
[1:20:32] &gt;&gt; So, I am God's building. Hallelujah.
[1:20:35] &gt;&gt; And especially I want to dwell on now I
[1:20:39] am the consequence. I am the result of
[1:20:41] God's handiwork.
[1:20:43] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:20:44] &gt;&gt; I am God's handiwork. I couldn't save
[1:20:47] myself. I couldn't cleanse myself. I
[1:20:49] couldn't rid myself of old habits. I
[1:20:52] couldn't rid myself of of of uncristlike
[1:20:55] nature and character
[1:20:58] &gt;&gt; and desires. I am God's building because
[1:21:02] God has done the work. Amen.
[1:21:04] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And it works.
[1:21:07] &gt;&gt; We are God's building.
[1:21:09] &gt;&gt; How long should I say that? Well,
[1:21:11] brother Vandom said, "Say it till you
[1:21:12] believe it.
[1:21:14] &gt;&gt; I am God's building."
[1:21:16] &gt;&gt; Right in the middle of your failure,
[1:21:18] say, "I am God's building." When
[1:21:20] something rises up within you, say
[1:21:22] that's not that's not what I should be
[1:21:24] thinking, say, "I am God's building."
[1:21:27] &gt;&gt; Oh, Holy Spirit, come and make an effect
[1:21:29] upon me.
[1:21:32] I am God's building.
[1:21:40] &gt;&gt; So we are both we are both a masterpiece
[1:21:44] of his work
[1:21:46] and also a dwelling place for him. In
[1:21:50] the masterpiece message, God the great
[1:21:53] sculptor has made him a masterpiece.
[1:21:57] For it is a piece of his first
[1:21:59] masterpiece
[1:22:01] like he made in the Garden of Eden. He
[1:22:03] took a piece from and made another piece
[1:22:07] and that was marred and felled. Now he's
[1:22:10] been Now he's been all this time
[1:22:13] building it up again. and he brought
[1:22:16] forth this masterpiece
[1:22:18] and was smitten in order uh that part
[1:22:22] that part that was smitten was in order
[1:22:25] to bring back again that masterpiece
[1:22:28] again.
[1:22:29] &gt;&gt; Talking about the Eve that came from
[1:22:30] Adam. If Adam was a masterpiece and God
[1:22:34] who could make no error took her from
[1:22:36] him, I ask was she a masterpiece?
[1:22:41] &gt;&gt; She was. Amen.
[1:22:44] &gt;&gt; Says there never was. Prophet said never
[1:22:46] was a woman like her.
[1:22:51] &gt;&gt; She's magnificent masterpiece. And how
[1:22:54] they two must have strolled through Eden
[1:23:00] until the serpent came along
[1:23:03] and promised her more light and she
[1:23:06] believed it. We don't want to get on
[1:23:07] into that. But he said further,
[1:23:12] "So the masterpiece and the son of God,
[1:23:14] the masterpiece and the bride, the
[1:23:17] masterpiece, Jesus Christ and the bride,
[1:23:21] he said, and it's a piece of him,
[1:23:25] &gt;&gt; which must be the fulfilling of the
[1:23:27] word." If it's a piece of him, if he was
[1:23:29] the fulfilling of the word, what about
[1:23:32] his wife's part?
[1:23:34] &gt;&gt; She's a fulfilling of the word. Amen.
[1:23:36] &gt;&gt; You need to say that I am a fulfilling
[1:23:39] of the word.
[1:23:40] &gt;&gt; That is my part. I am a fulfilling of
[1:23:42] the word. My husband, masterpiece,
[1:23:45] fulfilled the word. I am a part of him.
[1:23:49] &gt;&gt; Word of his word, spirit of his spirit,
[1:23:53] bone of his bone, flesh of his flesh,
[1:23:55] word of his word.
[1:23:58] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:24:00] &gt;&gt; Here we are. Regardless of what you what
[1:24:03] kind of week you had, I can say because
[1:24:06] the word of God says we have his spirit.
[1:24:10] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:24:12] &gt;&gt; Being born again, not of corruptible
[1:24:14] things, but of incorruptible by the word
[1:24:17] of God.
[1:24:19] &gt;&gt; We're birthed by the word of God.
[1:24:22] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:24:23] &gt;&gt; We need to keep preaching it.
[1:24:26] &gt;&gt; We need to keep saying it and you need
[1:24:27] to keep confessing it. Let us where we
[1:24:30] have victory over all the powers of
[1:24:33] darkness, but it's by your confession.
[1:24:39] &gt;&gt; So God is like a great contractor.
[1:24:41] Brother Brandham said in building this
[1:24:44] masterpiece, God has many trades.
[1:24:47] &gt;&gt; We won't talk now about materials
[1:24:49] because he talks about the 16 elements.
[1:24:52] But I wanted to just digress from that.
[1:24:54] I want to talk about the administration.
[1:24:57] He's got many trades.
[1:25:00] You see some of these highrises and
[1:25:02] these skyscrapers that are downtown
[1:25:04] especially. I want you just to think for
[1:25:06] a moment uh what trades, what skilled
[1:25:10] people.
[1:25:14] I've sat on 747 jets. You know, my mind
[1:25:18] works in very childish ways. I sit there
[1:25:22] in that big jet and I think like the
[1:25:25] little woman who first saw the first
[1:25:26] train threw her apron up in there and
[1:25:28] said, "It'll never go. It'll never go."
[1:25:30] And when the train got chugging about 20
[1:25:32] miles down the down the track, she threw
[1:25:34] her apron up again and said, "It'll
[1:25:35] never stop. It'll never stop."
[1:25:38] I I've been on some of these planes when
[1:25:40] they loaded them with so many people and
[1:25:42] I sit there and I watch all those carts
[1:25:44] of all the suitcases and tons and tons
[1:25:47] and then the freight coming in. Yeah.
[1:25:50] &gt;&gt; I said, "This thing's never going to get
[1:25:52] off the ground.
[1:25:53] &gt;&gt; I just know it." And then in my perhaps
[1:25:58] juvenile thought, I look at the rivets
[1:26:01] in the wings. Yeah.
[1:26:04] &gt;&gt; And when I look at those rivets and I
[1:26:06] see how this plane is put together, I
[1:26:09] get very very humbled when I realize
[1:26:11] before before this was ever a piece of
[1:26:14] aluminum or metal in a in a in Boeing's
[1:26:18] plant in Seattle. Before that, some guy
[1:26:21] sat at a drawing board
[1:26:24] and dreamed up this wing.
[1:26:26] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:26:27] &gt;&gt; And dreamed up where every rivet's
[1:26:29] supposed to go. And he has to draw he
[1:26:32] has to draw it where everyone is. These
[1:26:34] are going to be x space apart. I hope
[1:26:37] you don't think this is too childish,
[1:26:39] but he thinks that it's got to be
[1:26:40] exactly so many, you know, millimeters
[1:26:44] or whatever they work on. And every
[1:26:46] rivet has to go into place. And that's
[1:26:48] what I think about. I think about before
[1:26:50] before this thing even came into being,
[1:26:54] somebody dreamed it up on a piece of
[1:26:56] paper.
[1:26:58] &gt;&gt; What a plan. And then the thing roars
[1:27:00] down the down the runway and actually
[1:27:03] takes off.
[1:27:05] &gt;&gt; Well, I'm glad somebody drew a right
[1:27:07] kind of plan.
[1:27:09] &gt;&gt; But there happens to be another plan.
[1:27:14] &gt;&gt; And God put it on paper first.
[1:27:17] &gt;&gt; Before it became flesh, it was word
[1:27:21] &gt;&gt; and he put it on paper.
[1:27:23] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:27:26] And the word became flesh
[1:27:28] &gt;&gt; and dwelt among us.
[1:27:31] &gt;&gt; And he was a masterpiece.
[1:27:33] &gt;&gt; You talk about flying. He didn't need
[1:27:36] any rivets.
[1:27:38] &gt;&gt; He didn't need any wings.
[1:27:40] &gt;&gt; He ran up to Bethany and blessed them
[1:27:43] and departed.
[1:27:45] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. I like what brother Brandham
[1:27:47] says. Oh, they talk about astronauts in
[1:27:49] this age. We've had astronauts for
[1:27:51] centuries.
[1:27:54] Enoch was an astronaut.
[1:27:56] &gt;&gt; Elijah was an astronaut. Jesus was an
[1:27:59] astronaut. And there's a bunch of them
[1:28:01] sitting here today.
[1:28:05] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:28:07] &gt;&gt; Who shall be changed. We shall not all
[1:28:10] sleep, but we shall be changed. That's
[1:28:14] what the scripture says. We shall be
[1:28:16] changed in a moment, in the twinkling of
[1:28:19] an eye, before you even bat your eye for
[1:28:22] a next blink. It could happen.
[1:28:25] &gt;&gt; You'll be changed. And the prophet of
[1:28:27] God says the atoms of this body will be
[1:28:30] transformed.
[1:28:34] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:28:36] &gt;&gt; That's the kind of administration I want
[1:28:38] to be under.
[1:28:41] Amen.
[1:28:44] &gt;&gt; Now, brother Brandon made just a
[1:28:45] comment. He said,
[1:28:47] he said, "You could pour
[1:28:50] gallons of oil or whatever term." He
[1:28:52] said, "You could pour oil all over a
[1:28:53] person's head, cast out every devil you
[1:28:56] can dream of or think of, that devil
[1:28:58] will sit right there
[1:29:00] &gt;&gt; unless you know exactly." How will you
[1:29:02] know? By the discernment of the Holy
[1:29:04] Spirit and by the plan that God has put
[1:29:07] in place. Hallelujah. There's a certain
[1:29:10] order. God has a certain order. You
[1:29:13] can't ignore the order and expect the
[1:29:15] results.
[1:29:18] &gt;&gt; You can't ignore God's man and get the
[1:29:20] results.
[1:29:24] &gt;&gt; You try to ignore the things that God
[1:29:26] has laid down in this message.
[1:29:29] &gt;&gt; And you think, and you could lay it
[1:29:31] down, say, "Well, you know, it doesn't
[1:29:33] really mean it. Says 30 miles an hour
[1:29:34] out here, but it doesn't really mean it.
[1:29:36] I'll go 50." Yeah. Well, you may get
[1:29:39] away with it for a while. And I've had
[1:29:42] people deny the message, walk right away
[1:29:44] once, but they've even said to me,
[1:29:46] "Yeah, nothing happened to me." Oh,
[1:29:49] we're not talking about whether it
[1:29:50] happened today. I see them speeding here
[1:29:53] in front of the school and they they
[1:29:55] they just go by. They could say when
[1:29:57] they go through, "No, nothing happened
[1:29:59] to me." H don't put that fear thing on
[1:30:02] me.
[1:30:04] But then one day you run into the
[1:30:07] policeman.
[1:30:09] &gt;&gt; He's there.
[1:30:10] &gt;&gt; Then something happens.
[1:30:13] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:30:20] &gt;&gt; For every house, the scripture says
[1:30:22] Hebrews 1 3 and 4, for every house is
[1:30:26] builded by some man,
[1:30:28] &gt;&gt; and he that built all things is God.
[1:30:33] right?
[1:30:34] &gt;&gt; We can only imagine the multitude of
[1:30:37] skilled people
[1:30:40] that are taken to build even some of
[1:30:43] these things that we see around us. Now
[1:30:48] listen closely to this paragraph.
[1:30:50] Why are we in the condition that we're
[1:30:52] in? He's speaking to the whole church.
[1:30:57] Why are we in the condition that we're
[1:30:59] in? We could say Christendom or full
[1:31:03] gospel people.
[1:31:06] He says or we can even say believers of
[1:31:08] this message.
[1:31:11] He says there it is. If a contractor and
[1:31:14] he goes back now the same way that I'm
[1:31:17] making references today. If a contractor
[1:31:20] laid out a plan for his men to build a
[1:31:23] house such and such a way.
[1:31:27] Each man ignored the blueprint
[1:31:32] &gt;&gt; and they built the house according to
[1:31:34] the way that they thought each man
[1:31:37] should build it. What kind of a looking
[1:31:40] house would it be?
[1:31:45] &gt;&gt; So now
[1:31:47] you
[1:31:49] are a house
[1:31:51] &gt;&gt; in part of this whole it could be
[1:31:53] corporate and it can be individual. You
[1:31:55] are part
[1:31:59] of this house
[1:32:02] and how you take and how you receive
[1:32:07] what's been laid out.
[1:32:09] We talk about a message.
[1:32:12] I can I can prove to you by God's
[1:32:14] vindication
[1:32:16] that that was God's
[1:32:18] administrator
[1:32:20] for this age. Amen.
[1:32:24] &gt;&gt; That's God's administration for this
[1:32:26] age, meeting out what is needful for
[1:32:30] this age.
[1:32:31] &gt;&gt; So, well, we ignore it. We ignore the
[1:32:34] warnings or we say, "Well, you know, I I
[1:32:38] I think maybe that was just kind of
[1:32:39] Brother Brandham's own thought." Mhm.
[1:32:42] Okay, fine. Or I think that's just the
[1:32:46] pastor's, you know, I think that's his
[1:32:48] idea.
[1:32:50] You know, I I'm going to say something
[1:32:52] here. This is this is you maybe, you
[1:32:55] know, I might make more enemies than
[1:32:57] friends, but I believe that if a person
[1:33:00] comes to the right office and the right
[1:33:04] attitude and asks with sincerity for a
[1:33:08] question that even if they got the wrong
[1:33:10] answer, God would honor their process.
[1:33:14] &gt;&gt; God would honor them
[1:33:17] &gt;&gt; and make it turn out right.
[1:33:25] See, God has his program. God has and it
[1:33:29] can be in such simplicity. I mean, you
[1:33:31] know, who was going to take who was
[1:33:33] going to take brother Brennham's
[1:33:36] uh
[1:33:37] who's going to take his advice? Yes. For
[1:33:40] healing or for something that they had
[1:33:42] need of. I hope you're staying with me.
[1:33:45] But who's going to take his advice and
[1:33:47] counsel on how the doctrine of the
[1:33:50] church should be and what should be
[1:33:51] taught and so on and so forth. To me,
[1:33:54] it's a paradox. How do you say this is
[1:33:56] right? This was all truth, but over here
[1:33:58] it's all wrong.
[1:34:01] &gt;&gt; Hello.
[1:34:03] You know, I'm just trying to be very
[1:34:04] very pragmatic. I'm just trying to be
[1:34:06] very Listen, we're not talking about,
[1:34:09] you know, having a better life and
[1:34:10] having a little better social structure
[1:34:12] outside. We're talking about eternal
[1:34:13] life.
[1:34:17] Amen.
[1:34:19] &gt;&gt; So these are things that I want you to
[1:34:22] really ponder and think about.
[1:34:25] So we have all these different trades.
[1:34:29] We're we're looking towards building
[1:34:33] uh a school building here in the corner
[1:34:35] of the property. And we've got the
[1:34:37] architects
[1:34:39] and those who have skill in drawing. But
[1:34:42] think of the trades. Think of the
[1:34:44] electricians.
[1:34:46] I've looked at blueprints. They don't
[1:34:48] mean anything to me. It's just a whole
[1:34:50] lot of it's a confusion.
[1:34:53] &gt;&gt; But a man who's trained in it, he knows
[1:34:55] what he's looking at.
[1:34:58] I have questions come up almost every
[1:35:00] week from people and they say, "Uh, I
[1:35:04] don't understand this."
[1:35:06] I got one I got a text from my daughter
[1:35:09] last night and she says, "Did you speak
[1:35:12] one time
[1:35:14] about
[1:35:15] standing in the water and out of the
[1:35:17] water?
[1:35:19] The earth standing in the water and out
[1:35:21] of the water." She said, "I'm reading it
[1:35:23] right now
[1:35:25] in in St. Peter's epistle. I'm reading
[1:35:29] it and it seems to me you spoke on it
[1:35:31] sometime." And I said, "Yes, it's in
[1:35:34] Genesis. It was the earth standing in
[1:35:36] the water and out of the water in the
[1:35:38] beginning of the creation. And then we
[1:35:41] came to where Jesus who the prophet said
[1:35:43] was the first part of the earth that God
[1:35:46] took in his redemptive plan. That body
[1:35:49] of Jesus Christ was the first part of
[1:35:51] the earth that he was going to redeem
[1:35:53] and it went and stood in the water and
[1:35:56] was out of the water and the dove came
[1:35:58] down said this is my son. Amen.
[1:36:03] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:36:03] &gt;&gt; And then in this day, here come the
[1:36:06] messenger that was to reveal him in his
[1:36:08] second coming standing in the water.
[1:36:12] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:36:13] &gt;&gt; The one that would receive the word of
[1:36:16] God.
[1:36:17] &gt;&gt; Some of you getting it.
[1:36:19] &gt;&gt; Sen. She sends me a text back. That's so
[1:36:22] enlightening.
[1:36:25] I'm glad a person can have even, you
[1:36:27] know, a daughter that can appreciate
[1:36:29] that.
[1:36:34] &gt;&gt; And every house is builded by some man,
[1:36:36] but he that built all things is God.
[1:36:40] &gt;&gt; That was Hebrews 3 and 4. And we can
[1:36:42] only only imagine just for a moment. I'm
[1:36:46] not going to be much longer now because
[1:36:47] I want to I want to carry on tonight,
[1:36:50] the Lord willing. And I just going to
[1:36:52] give you a little tidbit of where we'll
[1:36:53] be going tonight. But you can just
[1:36:56] imagine all the different I look around
[1:36:58] in this congregation. I see all the
[1:37:02] different ones that God uses here and
[1:37:04] use there. And and you just couldn't do
[1:37:06] without them. The body of Christ, this
[1:37:08] little unit of the body of Christ here,
[1:37:11] we just couldn't work without it. to the
[1:37:13] sisters that take care of, you know, you
[1:37:16] have a a funeral or you have a reception
[1:37:19] or you have something and and it's a
[1:37:21] part of the ministry. You need to you
[1:37:23] need to be able to have that. And if
[1:37:24] people look after it and they look after
[1:37:26] the music or they look after another
[1:37:29] part or they look after the people and I
[1:37:31] think of the deacons and I think of the
[1:37:32] trustees and they go way beyond and
[1:37:34] there's people that aren't trustees and
[1:37:36] aren't deacons that give all kinds of
[1:37:38] time and people that help one another
[1:37:41] and people that I heard someone was in
[1:37:43] need and their home was in need and and
[1:37:46] some brothers got together and went and
[1:37:47] and fixed the thing and looked at that
[1:37:49] that to me is ministry. That's all part
[1:37:52] of it. And something we hear about and a
[1:37:54] lot we don't hear about. It takes all of
[1:37:56] that. And no one person's going to do
[1:37:59] all that. No one can begin to do all
[1:38:01] that. And I think where the message goes
[1:38:03] and where God has intended it for it to
[1:38:05] go, it can only be a working organism, a
[1:38:08] working body that that achieves this.
[1:38:11] &gt;&gt; And one can't do it from, you know, uh-
[1:38:15] within themselves. And anybody who
[1:38:16] thinks they can do it all just cannot
[1:38:19] a big mistake. But he says, "A
[1:38:21] contractor lays out his plan for his men
[1:38:23] to build. If each one ignored the
[1:38:25] blueprint and they built the house
[1:38:27] according to the way they thought each
[1:38:28] man would build it, what kind of a a
[1:38:31] looking house would it be?"
[1:38:34] &gt;&gt; So now we have the foundation of the
[1:38:37] apostles and the prophets, Jesus Christ
[1:38:39] himself being the chief cornerstone.
[1:38:44] you know, just as a just as a phrase,
[1:38:48] Jesus Christ himself, and there's songs
[1:38:50] about it, Jesus being the chief
[1:38:52] cornerstone. I don't know what people
[1:38:54] think about, but and if Jesus is the
[1:38:57] builder of the house and you are the
[1:38:59] house,
[1:39:01] he has to be the chief cornerstone
[1:39:05] &gt;&gt; in your life. And if he happens to be
[1:39:08] this and if he has made this has
[1:39:12] revealed this through the prophet's
[1:39:15] message then if we ignore that chief
[1:39:19] cornerstone you're not going to be built
[1:39:20] upon it.
[1:39:24] &gt;&gt; Let me go on.
[1:39:28] &gt;&gt; He promised that the chief cornerstone
[1:39:31] shall we say or Christ they said unto us
[1:39:35] a son is born. It's going right back to
[1:39:37] the beginning. Unto us a child is born.
[1:39:40] Unto us a son is given. And the
[1:39:43] government shall be upon his shoulder.
[1:39:46] Those are just nice phrases, but you
[1:39:48] need to really get into the message to
[1:39:50] see what what that the government shall
[1:39:52] be upon his shoulder. And I'll perhaps
[1:39:54] read it later on or maybe tonight, but
[1:39:58] it goes back to the old wedding
[1:40:00] ceremony. Oh my, I wish you could tie
[1:40:02] this together because when it would be
[1:40:05] wedding time,
[1:40:06] &gt;&gt; our day, then it would be made known
[1:40:09] what that language even means. And the
[1:40:12] scripture says also through the prophet
[1:40:15] Isaiah, that the that the that the key
[1:40:19] of David, the key of David would be upon
[1:40:24] his shoulder. Now, you got to really
[1:40:26] concentrate for a moment. The key of
[1:40:29] David, not the key of Moses or of Elijah
[1:40:31] or someone else, but the key of David,
[1:40:35] the key of kingship
[1:40:38] would be upon his shoulder.
[1:40:41] And the whole scenario,
[1:40:44] the whole picture that's being
[1:40:45] described, Brother Brandham takes it and
[1:40:49] says it's the ancient wedding ceremony
[1:40:53] that is being depicted here in a
[1:40:55] beautiful way. So now remember the
[1:40:58] wedding ceremony is at the at a time
[1:41:01] it's king
[1:41:04] and king is identified in the scripture
[1:41:06] as a lion the lion of the tribe of Judah
[1:41:10] and so now and here that same scripture
[1:41:13] comes back over into the book of
[1:41:15] revelation
[1:41:17] that the key of David is upon his
[1:41:20] shoulder and the wedding ceremony was
[1:41:24] that the veil and sometime we have it in
[1:41:26] wedding ceremonies here. And perhaps you
[1:41:28] don't fully understand what it is. It
[1:41:30] may just look like it's a nice thing to
[1:41:32] do. And and the wedding ceremony was
[1:41:34] that the bride will take her veil off
[1:41:37] from herself and drape it and lay it
[1:41:40] over her groom's shoulder. He said, and
[1:41:44] I'll read it perhaps tonight,
[1:41:46] identifying, indicating that she is
[1:41:49] surrendering her entire being. She's
[1:41:52] surrendering all of her rights. She's
[1:41:55] surrendering all that she is to him. Now
[1:41:58] to put it in other language to that the
[1:42:01] bride of Jesus Christ who has been
[1:42:04] called and elected in this time because
[1:42:07] this is bride time. You've never heard
[1:42:10] so much about bride as you hear it in
[1:42:12] this message because it's a bride
[1:42:15] message
[1:42:16] &gt;&gt; and it happens to come at a certain
[1:42:19] season. This is not Luther's
[1:42:21] administration or Wesley's
[1:42:23] administration. And he said clearly,
[1:42:25] it's not Pentecost.
[1:42:28] &gt;&gt; Pentecost can never produce the bride of
[1:42:31] Jesus Christ.
[1:42:33] &gt;&gt; Because she denies the word
[1:42:36] &gt;&gt; hangs on to trinitarian things. It's not
[1:42:38] in the Bible.
[1:42:40] &gt;&gt; She can never bring it.
[1:42:44] &gt;&gt; Do you support me?
[1:42:47] &gt;&gt; It's a bride message. And it has to be
[1:42:50] the time when the bridegroom is coming
[1:42:54] into his kingship.
[1:42:56] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:42:57] &gt;&gt; Remembering the overlapping
[1:43:00] &gt;&gt; of the age.
[1:43:02] &gt;&gt; He's son of man, prophet
[1:43:05] &gt;&gt; on earth. I've got to come to it just a
[1:43:07] wee bit and give you a little teaser for
[1:43:08] tonight. Son of man was his
[1:43:11] identification as prophet on earth
[1:43:15] during his earthly visit. And the Bible
[1:43:18] tells us that and Jesus referred to it.
[1:43:21] He spoke it himself that they were
[1:43:23] determined
[1:43:25] to make him king.
[1:43:28] &gt;&gt; And he knew that this was not his kingly
[1:43:30] time.
[1:43:31] &gt;&gt; And the people even tore off the
[1:43:33] branches just prior to crucifying him.
[1:43:36] Tore the branches. Are you with me?
[1:43:39] &gt;&gt; Tore the branches and and and waved
[1:43:42] them. Hosana in the highest. Blessed is
[1:43:44] he that cometh in the name of the Lord.
[1:43:46] And they wanted to make him king,
[1:43:49] &gt;&gt; but it wouldn't work
[1:43:51] &gt;&gt; because it was not the season.
[1:43:54] &gt;&gt; And so Jesus never administrated or
[1:43:57] administered. He never sent out his
[1:44:00] disciples to be representatives of his
[1:44:03] kingly role.
[1:44:05] &gt;&gt; He never said, "Now you go out. You're
[1:44:07] representatives of the king."
[1:44:10] &gt;&gt; No, he sent them out. preach the gospel,
[1:44:13] &gt;&gt; heal the sick,
[1:44:14] &gt;&gt; raise the dead, do all manner of these
[1:44:16] things. Why? Because it was part of his
[1:44:18] priesthood.
[1:44:20] &gt;&gt; And he told him, "Don't go till the Holy
[1:44:22] Spirit comes." Because it had to come
[1:44:24] under another administration.
[1:44:26] It can't come under this administration
[1:44:29] of prophet. It has to come under another
[1:44:31] administration. And the Bible says that
[1:44:33] after he died, he entered into the
[1:44:36] holiest of all.
[1:44:39] [Music]
[1:44:39] [Applause]
[1:44:41] into the holiest of all with his own
[1:44:43] blood.
[1:44:46] &gt;&gt; I thought the blood was shed and went to
[1:44:48] the ground. It did. But he had the he
[1:44:50] had the blood of his of his sacrifice
[1:44:53] and he entered into the holiest of all.
[1:44:54] Just think of it friends. The blood that
[1:44:56] cleansed you.
[1:44:58] &gt;&gt; The blood that is representing you today
[1:45:01] came before almighty God.
[1:45:04] where you and I we can't even imagine
[1:45:06] entering into that presence when the
[1:45:08] saraphims of the great creatures of of
[1:45:11] holiness come before him and and and say
[1:45:15] holy holy holy holy holy holy holy you
[1:45:20] talk about a holy presence but Christ
[1:45:22] came there on your behalf
[1:45:24] &gt;&gt; in that office as priest and entered
[1:45:27] into his high priestl
[1:45:35] entered into his priesthood
[1:45:37] &gt;&gt; and then came another administration.
[1:45:40] &gt;&gt; And so he said to the disciples, "Don't
[1:45:41] go tarry in Jerusalem until you're
[1:45:44] endued with power from on high. Another
[1:45:48] supernatural thing is going to come from
[1:45:50] another dimension and infuse your being.
[1:45:53] It's going to turn a coward Peter into a
[1:45:55] bold preacher of the gospel."
[1:45:57] Hallelujah. It's going to transform
[1:46:00] those men. It's going to turn James into
[1:46:02] a prayer warrior.
[1:46:06] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:46:07] &gt;&gt; This is a life-changing thing.
[1:46:13] &gt;&gt; I've been thinking some of you young
[1:46:14] people, don't you even dream of going on
[1:46:17] in the same way that you've gone on.
[1:46:19] This is this gospel is not about that.
[1:46:21] This gospel is a transformation.
[1:46:23] [Applause]
[1:46:26] Hallelujah.
[1:46:29] &gt;&gt; This isn't something just slip and slide
[1:46:31] along.
[1:46:32] &gt;&gt; It's a transforming gospel.
[1:46:35] &gt;&gt; If you mean business with God, he'll
[1:46:36] mean business with you.
[1:46:39] &gt;&gt; Jesus said, "Don't go till you're endued
[1:46:41] with power from on high." And those
[1:46:42] young men,
[1:46:44] &gt;&gt; they went out into the highways and
[1:46:46] byways and begin to deliver this gospel.
[1:46:49] It wasn't the message of the king.
[1:46:52] &gt;&gt; And it wasn't just a message of a
[1:46:53] prophet. It was the message of the
[1:46:55] priest.
[1:46:57] &gt;&gt; It was a message of uh uh intercession.
[1:47:01] It was a message of mercy. It was a
[1:47:03] message of healing.
[1:47:05] &gt;&gt; And so in the end time,
[1:47:07] &gt;&gt; oh my, help me now. In the end time, he
[1:47:10] had to introduce it because the
[1:47:12] priesthood is going to come to a cease.
[1:47:16] &gt;&gt; It's going to cease.
[1:47:18] &gt;&gt; And he had to come with that same
[1:47:20] ministry of Jesus Christ. Amen.
[1:47:22] &gt;&gt; It had to have the same characteristics
[1:47:25] had to come out of nowhere.
[1:47:27] &gt;&gt; And they even spoke about Jesus
[1:47:29] language,
[1:47:30] &gt;&gt; the language, the Galilean language, a
[1:47:32] gutal language, a plain simple language,
[1:47:35] the language of the poor. What did
[1:47:38] William Brandon preach? The language of
[1:47:40] the poor
[1:47:45] &gt;&gt; had to come with the same
[1:47:46] characteristics.
[1:47:48] But he came and his prayers were simple,
[1:47:52] &gt;&gt; the Lord Jesus Christ. But someone from
[1:47:56] another realm
[1:47:57] &gt;&gt; heard the prayer
[1:47:59] &gt;&gt; and a thing happened
[1:48:01] &gt;&gt; without a bunch of shouting. It
[1:48:03] happened.
[1:48:06] &gt;&gt; And here comes another messenger and he
[1:48:08] prays a simple prayer and the child
[1:48:11] crippled up begins to straighten out the
[1:48:14] same power, the same miracles because
[1:48:17] it's the same God.
[1:48:20] &gt;&gt; And now it's under another
[1:48:21] administration, the revealing of the son
[1:48:23] of man. But he has to come the same way
[1:48:28] &gt;&gt; with the supernatural attendance, with
[1:48:30] the phenomena. It has to come that way.
[1:48:34] &gt;&gt; But then as Jesus continued in his
[1:48:37] ministry, then he had to come with his
[1:48:39] message.
[1:48:43] &gt;&gt; His message.
[1:48:45] I and my father are one.
[1:48:48] &gt;&gt; Oh, I have it in my message. I wish I
[1:48:51] could take to you. When God took Eve
[1:48:55] from Adam,
[1:48:57] God didn't give her a big message.
[1:49:00] It was Adam that gave her a message.
[1:49:04] &gt;&gt; And the message that Adam gave her,
[1:49:07] you are bone of my bone. Told her where
[1:49:09] she come from.
[1:49:13] &gt;&gt; You're flesh of my flesh.
[1:49:17] &gt;&gt; And therefore shall a man leave father
[1:49:19] and mother
[1:49:21] &gt;&gt; and be joined to his wife. And he came
[1:49:25] and gave her a message of oneness. Amen.
[1:49:30] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:49:33] &gt;&gt; And the message of the messenger in this
[1:49:35] hour came exactly the same
[1:49:37] &gt;&gt; with a message of healing, restoration.
[1:49:40] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:49:42] &gt;&gt; And redemption had to come. Then had to
[1:49:45] come the message of oneness.
[1:49:48] &gt;&gt; Total oneness.
[1:49:50] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:49:51] &gt;&gt; Tell her. Had to tell the bride where
[1:49:53] you come from.
[1:49:55] had to tell the bride who you belong to.
[1:49:59] &gt;&gt; Had to tell the bride where you were
[1:50:01] going.
[1:50:02] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:50:04] &gt;&gt; Glory.
[1:50:08] &gt;&gt; And it was necessary, absolutely
[1:50:11] essential that that messenger under his
[1:50:14] administration should now begin to
[1:50:16] introduce Melzdc
[1:50:19] &gt;&gt; as another high priest. Oh, I'd like to
[1:50:22] start preaching now on the
[1:50:23] administration of Melchazdc.
[1:50:26] [Applause]
[1:50:27] &gt;&gt; And you may not be aware of it, but
[1:50:29] that's that's the high priest order that
[1:50:32] we're under.
[1:50:33] &gt;&gt; You're not under Aaron.
[1:50:36] &gt;&gt; You're under Melzdc.
[1:50:38] &gt;&gt; And if you're not familiar with the
[1:50:40] name, you need to get familiar with the
[1:50:41] name. He's in charge.
[1:50:47] He became Jesus Christ.
[1:50:52] &gt;&gt; And now Melzdc
[1:50:56] &gt;&gt; is king of Salem.
[1:50:58] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:50:59] &gt;&gt; And priest of the most high God
[1:51:01] &gt;&gt; that came to Abraham.
[1:51:04] &gt;&gt; And now in this generation, king of
[1:51:06] Salem,
[1:51:07] &gt;&gt; priest of the most high God, came to his
[1:51:10] messenger
[1:51:12] &gt;&gt; in the end time. And he came back there
[1:51:15] to show Abraham what his children what
[1:51:18] his seed would come to in their final
[1:51:22] end.
[1:51:23] &gt;&gt; And then when the children arrive, the
[1:51:26] children of the final end.
[1:51:30] &gt;&gt; He had to show them what kind of body.
[1:51:34] &gt;&gt; He had to reveal to them the kind of
[1:51:36] body they would come to.
[1:51:38] &gt;&gt; And that's in a different office.
[1:51:43] Hallelujah.
[1:51:47] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:51:49] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:51:49] &gt;&gt; We'll get into that tonight, Lord
[1:51:51] willing.
[1:51:57] &gt;&gt; It's wonderful.
[1:52:00] &gt;&gt; And that's why that's why
[1:52:03] your messenger had to come to you and
[1:52:05] say, and he only preached one message on
[1:52:08] it. preach it in the in the Hebrew
[1:52:11] series and Apostle Paul. You can read it
[1:52:15] before tonight. Read the seventh chapter
[1:52:17] of Hebrews. You can also read the fifth
[1:52:20] chapter.
[1:52:21] Apostle Paul who gave the doctrine of
[1:52:25] the to the early church. He says plenty
[1:52:28] about Melkisedc. You want to read it.
[1:52:30] And he also says to his people with
[1:52:33] everything that he said, there's much
[1:52:35] more that I need to say about this. But
[1:52:39] he said, "You're children right now and
[1:52:41] you're not able to bear it." So what is
[1:52:44] that saying? There has to be a there has
[1:52:46] to be a people come who can bear it.
[1:52:49] There has to be a people come who can
[1:52:51] hear it.
[1:52:52] &gt;&gt; And so now you have a messenger in end
[1:52:54] time come. Who is this?
[1:52:56] &gt;&gt; Melzdc. Not who was that
[1:52:59] &gt;&gt; or who will it be? He's saying who is
[1:53:02] this?
[1:53:11] Who is it?
[1:53:13] &gt;&gt; The high priest.
[1:53:15] &gt;&gt; After the order of Melzdc.
[1:53:19] &gt;&gt; How beautiful.
[1:53:21] &gt;&gt; I'll just give you two tidbits and then
[1:53:24] we'll close.
[1:53:26] What did Melzdc administer?
[1:53:30] Well, he administered
[1:53:32] bread and wine
[1:53:35] &gt;&gt; after the battle.
[1:53:38] &gt;&gt; You may think that you've got all kinds
[1:53:40] of struggles,
[1:53:42] &gt;&gt; but the messenger
[1:53:44] the messenger in this day, you have been
[1:53:47] recipients
[1:53:50] &gt;&gt; of sustaining bread
[1:53:53] &gt;&gt; and mana from above.
[1:53:56] And if it hasn't brought stimulation,
[1:53:57] you just haven't drunk from the right
[1:53:59] cup yet.
[1:54:00] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:54:02] &gt;&gt; We've received bread and wine.
[1:54:05] &gt;&gt; You said, "I thought this is going to be
[1:54:06] after." And the same prophet said, "The
[1:54:09] battle's over.
[1:54:10] &gt;&gt; The battle's finished.
[1:54:12] &gt;&gt; And the victory's won
[1:54:14] &gt;&gt; and the joy bells are already ringing."
[1:54:19] &gt;&gt; You might say, "Well, that's not in my
[1:54:21] world." Or you need to step into the
[1:54:23] next one. You need to step into the next
[1:54:25] kingdom. It's already over. It's already
[1:54:28] finished.
[1:54:30] &gt;&gt; I don't care what you face.
[1:54:33] &gt;&gt; It's already done.
[1:54:34] &gt;&gt; There is nothing. There's no weapon.
[1:54:38] &gt;&gt; There's no weapon formed that can
[1:54:40] prosper against a child of God.
[1:54:45] &gt;&gt; That's the scripture. Hallelujah.
[1:54:48] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:54:50] &gt;&gt; That's the administration we're under.
[1:54:56] What a glorious thing.
[1:54:58] &gt;&gt; What a glorious thing.
[1:55:00] &gt;&gt; It's a glorious church without spot or
[1:55:02] wrinkle.
[1:55:09] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:55:10] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:55:12] &gt;&gt; Brother Rod, I'll probably need to
[1:55:14] I don't have much of a voice to sing,
[1:55:16] but maybe you can help me.
[1:55:19] And you know where the brothers in the
[1:55:22] sound room were correct.
[1:55:24] I was to have a baby dedication.
[1:55:26] Actually, I was going to have two this
[1:55:28] morning. And I contacted the one
[1:55:33] parent.
[1:55:34] And I do have a valid excuse
[1:55:37] for forgetting things. Brother Raymond,
[1:55:40] I actually have a valid excuse. And I
[1:55:43] think you would probably agree with me.
[1:55:45] My wife is away.
[1:55:47] [Applause]
[1:55:52] We're going to dedicate brother Raymond
[1:55:54] and Sister Raisesa's child.
[1:55:57] You're going to help me, brother
[1:55:58] Raymond. You're the father. You're going
[1:56:01] to help me. And sistera and the
[1:56:04] grandparents are here from I believe
[1:56:08] Toronto
[1:56:10] or the east and also from the west. So
[1:56:13] east meets west right here.
[1:56:16] and Ree's parents are here. Brother
[1:56:19] Raymond's mother's here. And we're
[1:56:22] delighted. And hey, do you know what? We
[1:56:25] don't have any special program.
[1:56:28] &gt;&gt; We're going to give this baby a
[1:56:30] dedication.
[1:56:32] &gt;&gt; Amen. Let's just sing a little chorus,
[1:56:34] Brother Rod, while Brother Raymond and
[1:56:38] Sister Reissa come.
[1:56:51] [Music]
[1:56:53] I am so glad that our father in heaven
[1:56:59] tells of his love in the book he has
[1:57:04] wonderful things in the Bible I see. And
[1:57:09] this is the dearest that Jesus loves me.
[1:57:14] Oh, I am so glad that Jesus loves me.
[1:57:19] Jesus loves me. I know Jesus loves me.
[1:57:24] Oh, I so glad that Jesus loves me. Jesus
[1:57:31] loves me.
[1:57:36] Though I forget him and wander away,
[1:57:41] still he does love me wherever I stray.
[1:57:46] Back to his dear love. He
[1:57:50] [Music]
[1:57:54] Jesus loves me. I am so glad that Jesus
[1:58:00] loves me. Jesus loves me. Jesus loves
[1:58:05] me.
[1:58:07] I am so glad that Jesus loves me.
[1:58:12] Jesus loves me and
[1:58:17] I am so glad that Jesus loves me. Jesus
[1:58:23] loves me. Jesus loves me. I am so glad
[1:58:30] that Jesus loves me.
[1:58:33] Jesus loves me.
[1:58:36] &gt;&gt; Take that course again.
[1:58:39] &gt;&gt; I'm so glad that Jesus loves me. It's
[1:58:43] on.
[1:58:44] &gt;&gt; I am so glad that Jesus loves me.
[1:58:49] Jesus loves me. Jesus loves me.
[1:58:54] I am so glad that Jesus loves me.
[1:59:00] Jesus loves
[1:59:02] me.
[1:59:05] I am so glad that Jesus loves me. Jesus
[1:59:11] loves me.
[1:59:13] Jesus loves me.
[1:59:16] I am so glad that Jesus loves me.
[1:59:21] Jesus loves me.
[1:59:27] Sister Reissa's voice has blessed us all
[1:59:31] &gt;&gt; over and over again.
[1:59:34] &gt;&gt; And if I had a voice like that, I
[1:59:35] probably wouldn't even try to talk. I
[1:59:37] just sing my way through life.
[1:59:41] God bless you, Seresa. Now, where you're
[1:59:44] going to help me, Brother Raymond, has
[1:59:46] give me the names. This baby's carrying
[1:59:49] got some heavy names
[1:59:52] and you know what they mean. And I don't
[1:59:54] have the names with me in front of me.
[1:59:56] &gt;&gt; Uh, her name is Tea.
[1:59:58] &gt;&gt; Tea.
[1:59:59] &gt;&gt; Abigail. Zion.
[2:00:01] &gt;&gt; Abigail. Zion.
[2:00:03] &gt;&gt; Young.
[2:00:06] &gt;&gt; That's it. Tea means precious. Um,
[2:00:09] Abigail is the father's joy. And Zion.
[2:00:17] &gt;&gt; We've arrived.
[2:00:23] and tella Abigail Zion is just sleeping
[2:00:26] through the whole thing.
[2:00:29] &gt;&gt; You don't bother her a bit. She's not
[2:00:30] nervous.
[2:00:33] And the Bible says, "And the and the
[2:00:36] parents, the mothers and the fathers
[2:00:39] brought and the word is really wonderful
[2:00:41] because you're not just bringing her
[2:00:44] here in a ceremony, but they brought
[2:00:46] them to the word. They brought them to
[2:00:48] Christ. And that's not just a single
[2:00:52] event.
[2:00:53] You'll be bringing them, but they wanted
[2:00:56] her and their children to be blessed as
[2:00:59] you have brought her. And they brought
[2:01:01] young children to him that he would
[2:01:03] touch them. And his disciples rebuked
[2:01:06] them that brought them. But when Jesus
[2:01:08] saw it, he was much displeased.
[2:01:11] Something special in his heart for these
[2:01:14] gifts because he knows where they come
[2:01:16] from.
[2:01:16] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:01:19] And he said unto them, "Suffer the
[2:01:20] little children to come unto me, and
[2:01:22] forbid them not, for if such is the
[2:01:24] kingdom of God.
[2:01:26] For verily I say unto you, whosoever
[2:01:28] shall not receive the kingdom of God as
[2:01:30] a little child, he shall not enter
[2:01:32] therein." And he took them up in his
[2:01:35] arms,
[2:01:36] put his hands upon them, and blessed
[2:01:39] them. And that's what we're going to do.
[2:01:43] Taking this precious little one, Tea.
[2:01:54] I tell you what, she's a sweet bundle.
[2:01:59] I put my hands upon her.
[2:02:03] Dear Father,
[2:02:06] in the sacredness of this moment,
[2:02:09] I'm a poor substitute for Jesus Christ.
[2:02:14] But Lord Jesus, in this moment, I pray
[2:02:17] that you'll just take and indwell my
[2:02:20] body in such a way that our brother
[2:02:23] Raymond and sister Reisa
[2:02:27] and their loved ones that are here with
[2:02:29] them may know that God, creator of
[2:02:33] heavens and earth and giver of every
[2:02:35] good gift, blesses now this child in the
[2:02:39] name of Jesus Christ, the son of God.
[2:02:42] Father, I pray that you'll take this
[2:02:44] tea, Abigail, and Zion.
[2:02:48] Oh God, may your hand be upon her for
[2:02:52] good and not for evil. May these
[2:02:55] parents, Lord, bring her often into your
[2:02:59] presence and teach her the ways of God.
[2:03:03] I pray your blessing will be upon the
[2:03:05] home. I ask you'll bless this child with
[2:03:08] good health, oh God. Keep evil from her.
[2:03:12] keep sickness from her. And I pray that
[2:03:15] when her ears first hear and her mind
[2:03:19] and heart registers the name of Jesus
[2:03:23] Christ, may there be something special
[2:03:26] within her. May it be a special
[2:03:28] response.
[2:03:30] &gt;&gt; May there be a special love that are
[2:03:32] well up in her heart. And may she serve
[2:03:34] you in her youth and in her childhood. I
[2:03:37] pray that you will you will protect her
[2:03:39] and watch over her. And on that day, may
[2:03:42] she too stand there, I pray, robed, oh
[2:03:45] God, with the righteous. And I pray,
[2:03:48] Father, if if if time go on, allow her
[2:03:51] to sing like her parents sang. Give her
[2:03:54] a voice, oh God, like her mother. And
[2:03:56] may she sing praises to you. May she be
[2:03:59] an example to other young people. I pray
[2:04:02] in your name, I ask it now. And Lord, I
[2:04:04] dedicate her to you. I dedicate tea
[2:04:08] Abigail Zion in the name of the Lord
[2:04:11] Jesus Christ. Amen.
[2:04:15] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:04:15] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:04:19] &gt;&gt; God bless you, brother Raymond.
[2:04:22] Amen. God bless you, Sister Teresa.
[2:04:24] Amen. God bless you.
[2:04:30] Isn't he lovely?
[2:04:35] Amen. Would you like to just stand and
[2:04:49] I want to thank the Lord for the day
[2:04:50] that he's given us
[2:04:54] and I trust you'll come back this
[2:04:56] evening. Lord willing. I want to I want
[2:05:00] to continue where we left off this
[2:05:02] morning.
[2:05:05] We started by singing in the presence of
[2:05:07] Jehovah, but I would like to sing He
[2:05:09] came to me.
[2:05:12] He came to me.
[2:05:14] You didn't go to him, but he came to
[2:05:16] you.
[2:05:18] I wonder if he came to you this morning.
[2:05:21] Did he make himself real to you this
[2:05:23] morning? God bless you. God bless you.
[2:05:27] pray for the service this evening and
[2:05:30] the service in Seattle this afternoon.
[2:05:32] Yes. Amen.
[2:05:35] He came
[2:05:37] to me.
[2:05:42] He came
[2:05:44] to me.
[2:05:49] I would not come
[2:05:53] to where he was.
[2:05:56] [Music]
[2:06:01] We thank you.
[2:06:03] [Music]
[2:06:19] I

[2:06:24] He came to me.
[2:06:30] He came to me.
[2:06:37] He came to me
[2:06:44] [Music]
[2:06:48] to where he was he
[2:06:53] to
[2:06:58] as my
[2:07:02] [Music]
[2:07:05] cal
[2:07:11] [Music]
[2:07:15] to where he was.
[2:07:19] He came to me.
[2:07:23] [Music]
[2:07:26] &gt;&gt; I'd like to just say from my heart to
[2:07:28] your heart,
[2:07:30] thank you. God bless you for every
[2:07:34] prayer you've prayed
[2:07:36] for myself, for the meetings, for the
[2:07:38] ministry,
[2:07:41] for the bride of Christ.
[2:07:43] Thank you. God bless you. And I pray
[2:07:46] that God's richest blessings be upon you
[2:07:50] and that you'll go from victory to
[2:07:52] victory to victory. I believe in victory
[2:07:57] and the ultimate victory.
[2:08:00] And one day, please remember this as we
[2:08:03] close.
[2:08:05] We're going to be in another gathering
[2:08:08] &gt;&gt; by his grace.
[2:08:10] &gt;&gt; I want to be there more than anything in
[2:08:12] life. I think of it every day. I think
[2:08:14] of it every day. I think of it
[2:08:15] throughout the day. I want to be there.
[2:08:19] I want to be there. I don't feel worthy,
[2:08:22] but I just know that his grace will be
[2:08:24] sufficient.
[2:08:24] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:08:25] &gt;&gt; I want to be there. I want to hear the
[2:08:28] singing of the redeemed.
[2:08:32] &gt;&gt; I want that overwhelming,
[2:08:35] overwhelming,
[2:08:37] consuming
[2:08:38] feeling that must come through a body
[2:08:40] that's beyond
[2:08:43] sin and sickness.
[2:08:45] that consume allconsuming
[2:08:48] realization.
[2:08:50] It's over.
[2:08:53] &gt;&gt; It's over.
[2:08:55] &gt;&gt; No temptation can come my way. No
[2:08:59] problem can come my way. It's all over.
[2:09:04] &gt;&gt; Oh, I hope that's a reality to you.
[2:09:07] &gt;&gt; We thank him for it and that's why he
[2:09:09] came to us. We'll bow now and be
[2:09:11] dismissed.
[2:09:12] Our
[2:09:16] dear father,
[2:09:19] this great great plan,
[2:09:22] this scheme of redemption,
[2:09:25] this thing that you have ordered,
[2:09:28] you have caused it to be effective upon
[2:09:31] the earth. From your throne and from
[2:09:34] your domain,
[2:09:36] you have from this invisible realm, this
[2:09:40] invisible kingdom. Yet you have pressed
[2:09:43] through into this realm. You have
[2:09:46] brought us as individuals, as humans.
[2:09:49] You've brought us under the impact and
[2:09:52] under the effects of the Holy Spirit of
[2:09:55] God. You have transcended the
[2:09:57] dimensions. You sent your messenger, oh
[2:10:00] God, and on a constant basis as a
[2:10:04] demonstration to the people of this day.
[2:10:07] Oh, I trust we can appreciate it what
[2:10:09] you have done, Lord, in all of the
[2:10:12] glorious reality. How he transcended,
[2:10:15] Lord, and and made the eternal realm so
[2:10:18] real and brought it so near to us. And
[2:10:21] now, Father, let that continue. I pray
[2:10:24] that when the word is preached that your
[2:10:26] children, your elected, your appointed
[2:10:29] ones will be elevated up, oh God, into
[2:10:32] heavenly places. You have not made that
[2:10:36] term in the Bible in the heavenly places
[2:10:38] in Christ Jesus as some idol phrase. You
[2:10:42] brought it so it could be a reality. May
[2:10:45] the young men and young women, oh God,
[2:10:47] the families and the couples, I pray and
[2:10:50] the seniors, Lord, and all who are
[2:10:52] listening to my voice, let them be
[2:10:54] carried up, oh God, on the wings, I
[2:10:58] pray, of faith into the heavenlies of
[2:11:01] Christ Jesus. Bless the service this
[2:11:03] afternoon in Seattle. Oh Lord, be with
[2:11:07] the people that gather there. And as we
[2:11:09] gather this evening here, I pray you'll
[2:11:12] help us in Jesus Christ's name, dismiss
[2:11:15] us now in your grace. Amen.
[2:11:18] &gt;&gt; Amen. God bless you. You're dismissed in
[2:11:21] Jesus name. Go get some refreshment and
