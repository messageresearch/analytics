[24:39] [Music]
[24:50] How sweet
[24:53] that sound
[24:55] that
[25:00] like me
[25:05] on
[25:09] [Music]
[25:15] I
[25:18] But now
[25:19] I see
[25:21] &gt;&gt; it was amazing grace.
[25:25] Amazing
[25:27] grace.
[25:29] How sweet
[25:32] that sound
[25:37] [Music]
[25:39] like me.
[25:44] I
[25:46] was
[25:49] nowind.
[25:52] [Music]
[25:59] &gt;&gt; Can we sing that with just our voices
[26:01] this morning?
[26:03] [Music]
[26:10] &gt;&gt; The sound
[26:13] and save
[26:15] a rest
[26:18] like me.
[26:21] [Music]
[26:23] I
[26:26] was lost
[26:29] but now
[26:38] [Music]
[26:40] I see.
[26:42] Amazing grace.
[26:46] &gt;&gt; Amazing
[26:49] grace.
[26:51] How sweet
[26:54] the sound
[26:58] [Music]
[27:02] like me.
[27:08] I
[27:10] was lost.
[27:11] [Music]
[27:21] Now
[27:23] I see
[27:26] when we
[27:29] [Music]
[27:32] thin
[27:34] [Music]
[27:39] as
[27:41] the
[27:42] [Music]
[27:45] we
[27:51] sing
[27:52] God's praise
[27:55] when
[27:57] we
[27:59] [Music]
[28:04] &gt;&gt; I don't believe we'll ever tire of
[28:06] giving him praise.
[28:09] my every once in a while we get a little
[28:12] glimpse of the greatness of God and and
[28:16] it just uh
[28:19] it defies our imagination. It defies our
[28:22] ability. We cannot even begin to gather
[28:27] uh the mental powers to think of the
[28:30] greatness of God. And uh I've been
[28:33] really thinking about it lately, really
[28:36] affected by thinking how how God can be
[28:40] eternal, how he can fill all time and
[28:43] space. Uh I I'm just I'm done when I say
[28:48] those few words.
[28:50] And then the what man has discovered,
[28:54] you know, about time and space, uh what
[28:57] he's discovered just within himself, it
[29:00] just completely completely
[29:04] defies our mental capacity.
[29:08] Amen. And I'm glad it does.
[29:10] &gt;&gt; If we could understand him, it wouldn't
[29:13] be wouldn't be God. If we could just
[29:17] understand all about him, just wouldn't
[29:19] be him.
[29:21] So I I think you know he's everywhere.
[29:25] He's everywhere. He's all around where
[29:27] you're sitting. And yet he fills the
[29:30] universe.
[29:32] This great being. My brother Brandham
[29:35] said he'd be so mystical. People
[29:37] couldn't understand it. That's why that
[29:38] God had to come down that funnel of love
[29:42] called Jesus Christ
[29:44] and began in simplicity and humility to
[29:47] make himself known to us.
[29:49] and began to display his attributes.
[29:53] Heal the sick, deliver the bound.
[29:58] Oh my. Well, better not get preaching
[30:00] before I get preaching.
[30:02] His presence is wonderful and we love it
[30:04] so much. I'm glad that you're all here.
[30:07] We're glad for the invisible
[30:10] congregation.
[30:12] I noticed the other day, I don't look
[30:15] maybe once every few months, but I
[30:18] noticed the other day in one of the
[30:20] services there was a 178 locations all
[30:25] around the world that were live
[30:27] streaming while you're here and they're
[30:30] with us. Amen. And we're together. And I
[30:34] want to greet them all in the name of
[30:35] our Lord Jesus Christ. Wherever they may
[30:37] be in whatever time of the day or night
[30:39] it might be for them. Some I understand
[30:42] get up very very early in the morning in
[30:45] the wee hours of the morning, much
[30:47] earlier than any of us had to get up
[30:49] today to be in church and be with us
[30:52] today. And I say God bless them.
[30:55] &gt;&gt; Each one beautiful bride of Jesus
[30:58] Christ.
[30:59] Just going to make one comment about the
[31:03] uh a meeting brief meeting after the
[31:06] service this morning that brother Tom
[31:07] has called brother Jess regarding the uh
[31:11] camp. Now we're having the convention
[31:14] which is July 1st to the 8th and we had
[31:17] a marvelous turnout must have been close
[31:19] to 200 people that turned out to give
[31:23] themselves to assist or do whatever they
[31:26] could for the convention. And that's
[31:28] great because we just don't know how
[31:30] many bodies and people we're going to
[31:32] draw on. We never really
[31:36] uh
[31:38] we never put the finger on those that
[31:42] have helped out at the camp so much.
[31:44] Some of the people that have taken a
[31:46] more senior position at the camp, we did
[31:49] not put a finger on them to be team
[31:51] leaders or whatever more. There's a lot
[31:53] of capable people. And one of the
[31:55] reasons for that was we want you to be
[31:57] free and and if you have not, you know,
[32:01] uh if you've not uh been assigned
[32:04] anything for the convention, then we are
[32:07] certainly going to need some counselors
[32:10] for the convention for the camp, family
[32:13] camp. You might say, well, that's an
[32:14] awful lot to happen. That's correct, but
[32:17] the convention is one thing and the
[32:19] family camp is quite another. And we
[32:21] want to have as complete a camp as
[32:23] possible. And uh if we need to readjust
[32:26] it a wee bit, well, we will do so. But
[32:29] we just feel that if you come forward
[32:31] and there's uh support for counselors
[32:34] and everything, we'll we'll have a
[32:36] family camp. I think that uh we've never
[32:39] this is going to be 20 or 21 years. And
[32:42] uh it has been a marvelous just a
[32:45] marvelous uh component of the of the
[32:50] this church and for our church where we
[32:53] don't do it so much for the convention
[32:55] is for people that are everywhere and
[32:57] throughout the world and so on. And uh
[33:00] speaking brother Tim Puit yesterday
[33:04] uh and he plans to come probably he and
[33:07] his wife as well which we're happy for.
[33:11] So uh but the family camp I think is a
[33:14] very very important part. I think the
[33:16] young people and children uh I I believe
[33:20] that they need it. I I believe do you
[33:24] &gt;&gt; Amen. All right.
[33:28] And if I had children, I'd be making
[33:30] myself available in whatever way I
[33:32] could. And even if I didn't if I didn't
[33:35] have children in the camp, it's still
[33:38] still it's a wonderful opportunity to be
[33:40] able to do something for the Lord.
[33:44] Amen. Well, we'll stand and going to
[33:47] read some scripture.
[33:50] Um I'm going to begin by reading in
[33:53] Isaiah the 61st chapter. We're going to
[33:56] read in three places.
[33:59] Isaiah 61.
[34:02] Then we'll read in 1 John two verses.
[34:06] 1 John 2. And then we'll read in 1
[34:10] Thessalonians 4.
[34:13] So we'll begin in Isaiah 61. And I'm
[34:18] just reading verses 1 through3.
[34:22] The spirit of the Lord God is upon me
[34:26] because the Lord hath anointed me to
[34:28] preach good tidings unto the meek. He
[34:32] hath sent me to bind up the
[34:33] brokenhearted,
[34:35] to proclaim liberty to the captives, and
[34:39] the opening of the prison to them that
[34:42] are bound.
[34:44] to proclaim the acceptable year of the
[34:46] Lord and the day of vengeance of our
[34:49] God, to comfort all that mourn,
[34:53] to appoint unto them that mourn in Zion,
[34:58] to give unto them beauty for ashes, the
[35:01] oil of joy for mourning, and the garment
[35:04] of praise for the spirit of heaviness,
[35:07] that they might be called trees of
[35:09] righteousness, the planting of the Lord,
[35:13] that he might be glorified.
[35:18] And then we will read also now in first
[35:22] John
[35:26] uh the second chapter.
[35:31] We're going to read verse 20.
[35:35] But ye have an uncction from the Holy
[35:38] One,
[35:40] and ye know all things.
[35:43] In verse 27,
[35:46] but the anointing
[35:49] which you have received of him abideth
[35:52] in you, and you need not that any man
[35:55] teach you, but as the same anointing
[35:58] teacheth you of all things,
[36:01] and is truth and is no lie, and even as
[36:06] it hath taught you, you shall abide in
[36:09] him. I would like to just say before we
[36:12] read the next scripture that the word
[36:15] the uncction that you've received in
[36:18] verse 20 the word uncction and the word
[36:21] anointing in verse 27 are exactly the
[36:24] same word they are the same Greek word
[36:27] and they have to do with the anointing.
[36:30] So the anointing, the first scripture we
[36:32] read, for the spirit of the Lord is upon
[36:35] me, which was a prophecy concerning
[36:37] Jesus Christ. And Jesus repeated that
[36:41] same scripture in Luke the 4th chapter
[36:45] when he took the book and read from
[36:48] Isaiah and closed the book halfway
[36:51] through the second verse to proclaim the
[36:55] acceptable year of the Lord. But he
[36:57] closed it before he come to the day of
[36:59] vengeance of our God because it was not
[37:02] for his time. And now that was the
[37:05] anointing that Christ received. And now
[37:07] John is saying but you have received an
[37:10] anointing. It's not enough just to know
[37:12] that Christ had received anointing but
[37:14] you have received an anointing.
[37:17] And I am wanting to direct my thoughts
[37:20] today and not my thoughts alone. I trust
[37:23] they're the thoughts of God that were
[37:26] brought to me and then I'm able to
[37:27] convey them to you. But I would like to
[37:30] take the subject anointed for rapture.
[37:35] And so we will read in first
[37:36] Thessalonians concerning the rapture in
[37:39] the fourth chapter of 1 Thessalonians
[37:42] starting at verse 15.
[37:45] For this we say unto you by the word of
[37:47] the Lord,
[37:49] that we which are alive and remain unto
[37:52] the coming of the Lord shall not prevent
[37:54] them which are asleep.
[37:56] For the Lord himself shall descend from
[37:58] heaven with a shout, and with the voice
[38:01] of the archangel,
[38:03] and with the trump of God, and the dead
[38:05] in Christ shall rise first. Then we
[38:08] which are alive and remain shall be
[38:11] caught up together with them in the
[38:13] clouds to meet the Lord in the air. And
[38:16] so shall we ever be with the Lord.
[38:19] Wherefore comfort one another with these
[38:23] words. And may we be comforted today by
[38:26] these words. May we be encouraged and
[38:28] may all doubt and question be banished
[38:31] in his presence. We'll pray.
[38:35] Oh almighty God, I come to you in that
[38:39] holy righteous name of Jesus Christ. We
[38:43] come to you Lord with a sense of feeling
[38:47] unworthy and yet we come because we know
[38:51] we are accepted in the beloved. And who
[38:54] could bring us before your throne? Who
[38:57] could declare, oh God, so that we would
[39:01] not have any shame? Who could declare us
[39:03] before the throne? But this one that we
[39:06] have accepted and received as our
[39:09] savior, the lovely Lord Jesus Christ,
[39:12] our bridegroom and the husband of the
[39:15] bride. Oh God, we are coming because
[39:19] you're the God of Abraham and you made
[39:21] promise to him. You're the God of Isaac
[39:24] and the God of Jacob. You spoke to Moses
[39:27] from a burning bush that was not
[39:29] devoured by the flame. You made yourself
[39:32] known to the prophets down through the
[39:34] ages and to the messengers and to the
[39:37] apostles. And you brought forth Jesus
[39:40] Christ as a sacrifice for our sins and
[39:43] gave him freely. Oh, how terrible our
[39:46] sins must have been. What a chasm. What
[39:49] a separation from a holy God. But you
[39:52] sent forth Jesus Christ with the pure,
[39:56] spotless lamb of God, the blood of God
[39:59] as our sacrifice today. And we stand
[40:01] here washed. We stand here cleansed. We
[40:05] stand here perfect in your sight, Lord,
[40:07] because the sacrifice, our sacrifice was
[40:10] perfect. We don't feel that perfection
[40:14] as such, but we know that you have said
[40:17] so in the word. And so, we're coming on
[40:19] the basis of your promise. We're coming
[40:22] on the basis of your provision. And I
[40:24] pray now the Holy Spirit come and take
[40:27] full charge and control of this meeting.
[40:30] Take full control of every mind. Oh God,
[40:33] bring into bring every mind and every
[40:36] thought into subjection to the will and
[40:39] plan of the Holy Ghost. May your purpose
[40:42] be accomplished not only within the
[40:44] confines of this building and this
[40:46] sanctuary, but out wherever the service
[40:50] today is streamed. I pray father let the
[40:53] Holy Spirit come into every room into
[40:56] every place and now God give liberty I
[40:59] ask in the name of Jesus Christ
[41:03] for your glory alone. Amen. You may be
[41:06] seated.
[41:18] Brother Brandham addressed the subject
[41:20] of rapture in the rapture message at the
[41:23] very beginning
[41:25] by saying that the word rapture does not
[41:27] even appear in the Bible which it
[41:29] doesn't. What appears in the Bible is
[41:32] that we shall be caught up.
[41:36] And uh he said that
[41:40] uh the Bible said caught up being caught
[41:42] up. And we read he read in Thessalonians
[41:47] this order. He calls it the order of
[41:51] this great rapture that will take place
[41:54] in the last days.
[41:59] this rapture.
[42:01] There's uh uh an aspect about the
[42:04] rapture which I just want to touch on
[42:06] before we come into the anointing
[42:08] because my subject is largely upon the
[42:10] anointing.
[42:12] The apostle Paul
[42:14] related an experience which he had.
[42:18] He said, "I knew a man in Christ about
[42:21] 14 years ago.
[42:23] Whether in the body I cannot tell or
[42:26] whether out of the body I cannot tell.
[42:30] God knows.
[42:32] Such a one caught up to the third
[42:34] heaven.
[42:38] He said how that he was caught up into
[42:40] paradise and heard unspeakable words
[42:44] which is not lawful for a man to utter.
[42:50] And then this one who had experienced
[42:53] that kind of an experience, he was the
[42:56] one who could
[42:58] say what he said concerning the rapture
[43:00] or being caught up
[43:03] and give us a give us just a a very very
[43:07] fundamental foundation.
[43:10] We were that are alive and remain. We
[43:13] will not prevent them that are asleep.
[43:16] And he's he's crossing dimension them
[43:18] that are asleep and we that are alive
[43:20] and remain and then they will be li
[43:22] raised up and we'll be caught up
[43:24] together with them to meet the Lord in
[43:26] the air. He's just he's spanning such a
[43:29] an enormous amount of of of thought
[43:33] here. A person has to really give
[43:35] themselves to think about that
[43:39] and that is the rapture. And he saw
[43:42] unspeakable things.
[43:44] And so he said he was he was caught up
[43:48] 14 years ago. I cannot tell but he he
[43:51] uses the same phrase. He was caught up
[43:56] into the third heaven.
[43:59] And now this catching up to be caught
[44:01] up. And brother Brandham uses the phrase
[44:03] catch up
[44:05] literally in the Hebrews to seize. And
[44:09] it's to seize by force.
[44:12] It's to seize, to claim for oneself
[44:15] eagerly. It's not just to seize.
[44:19] It's not just that act, but it's to
[44:21] seize quickly and eagerly for one's own
[44:24] self. In other words, it would be to
[44:26] say, "This is mine."
[44:28] &gt;&gt; And I'm taking it quickly.
[44:31] &gt;&gt; I'm retrieving it. It belongs to me.
[44:35] &gt;&gt; To save it eagerly.
[44:38] And furthermore, it comes from a base
[44:41] word that is not only to take away. Not
[44:44] only to take it, not only to seize it,
[44:46] but to lift it up. So the act is to
[44:48] seize it, take it to myself eagerly,
[44:50] quickly and to lift it up, to raise it
[44:53] up. It is something that is not just it
[44:56] doesn't give the impression that we just
[44:58] take it and hold it to ourselves here in
[45:01] this place. But the purpose of seizing
[45:03] it and taking it to oneself eagerly is
[45:06] so that they might bear it away. To take
[45:10] away and to lift up it come from arrow
[45:12] to lift it up heavenly that which is
[45:15] seized and that which belongs to the one
[45:18] who is seizing it to take it by force.
[45:23] The Bible says that the last enemy to be
[45:27] destroyed is death.
[45:30] I want you to think about that.
[45:33] Death is not anybody's friend.
[45:37] Death is not anyone is not one that any
[45:41] one of us want to invite.
[45:44] Death comes to our homes and our
[45:47] families as an unwanted guest. And it
[45:50] will always be an unwanted guest. It is
[45:54] an enemy. And I can well imagine that
[45:57] the last enemy to be destroyed is death.
[46:01] This is going to be the most fierce of
[46:03] all struggles. This is going to be the
[46:06] ultimate battle
[46:09] when God destroys death.
[46:14] &gt;&gt; Death which reigns in our physical
[46:16] bodies at this moment.
[46:18] &gt;&gt; You have it right in you.
[46:21] &gt;&gt; We are dying as of this moment. We're a
[46:25] dying people. So, it's not I'm not
[46:27] speaking about something that is out
[46:29] here, you know, something that's up in
[46:31] the future. You have it with you.
[46:35] &gt;&gt; And there's only one counterattack to
[46:37] that, and that's life. If you're here
[46:40] without Christ, you're dying without
[46:42] hope.
[46:44] &gt;&gt; And you are certainly dying. If you're
[46:47] here and you're in a backsliden state,
[46:49] you're in a terrible condition. If
[46:52] you're here and just living in some
[46:54] lukewarm cool half, you know, kind of
[46:59] half uh just go along situation which
[47:03] often happens in a church. Young people
[47:06] or parents or husbands or wives, we're
[47:09] all susceptible to it perhaps. I trust
[47:11] by the grace of God even after the
[47:13] service that that will not exist in any
[47:16] heart here because it's a terrible thing
[47:18] to be under the reign of death. It's a
[47:21] terrible thing to be under the hold and
[47:23] the grip of your enemy.
[47:25] &gt;&gt; And death is an enemy.
[47:29] &gt;&gt; I don't need to even have you say amen
[47:32] to that. I can say amen to that. Death
[47:34] is an enemy.
[47:36] &gt;&gt; I don't like it in I don't like it when
[47:39] it happens and I don't like it in slow
[47:41] motion. I don't like sickness. Sickness
[47:44] is death. I don't like sickness. I don't
[47:47] like infirmity. It's all part of Satan's
[47:50] kingdom. It's foreign to us and we're
[47:53] opposed to it. Hallelujah. We believe in
[47:57] We believe in deliverance.
[47:59] &gt;&gt; We believe in healing. We believe in
[48:02] supernatural. We believe it because our
[48:04] God is that
[48:06] &gt;&gt; and we can't be anything else.
[48:12] The last enemy to be destroyed
[48:15] is death.
[48:17] And the word destroyed is to render
[48:21] idle.
[48:23] The last enemy to be re to be
[48:25] inactivated
[48:27] is death to cause a person to have no
[48:31] further efficiency.
[48:33] God is going to cause death to be in
[48:37] inactive.
[48:39] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[48:40] &gt;&gt; He will not be active. Satan cannot be
[48:43] active through the angel of death upon
[48:45] the believer anymore simply because how
[48:48] do we know that? Simply because it's
[48:49] been said.
[48:51] &gt;&gt; And that's the only basis that we have
[48:53] to believe that. Otherwise, we just die
[48:55] like animals.
[48:57] &gt;&gt; And I resist that
[49:00] &gt;&gt; and resent that.
[49:02] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. I would not allow Satan to
[49:04] even impose that upon our minds. And you
[49:07] want to be sure to shut it out of your
[49:09] mind today. He has no right. He has no
[49:12] claim. I'm not his in any way, shape, or
[49:15] form.
[49:16] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. This message came to me on
[49:19] the wings of healing.
[49:21] &gt;&gt; Glory to God. On restoration, healing
[49:24] under his wings, and there I will abide.
[49:28] &gt;&gt; Glory to God.
[49:30] &gt;&gt; It's to cause a person or a thing to
[49:33] have lose its efficiency, to deprive it
[49:36] of force. The last enemy to be destroyed
[49:39] is death. God is going to deprive it of
[49:42] force
[49:44] &gt;&gt; on behalf of the on behalf of those that
[49:46] are caught up.
[49:49] &gt;&gt; I don't know if I were here today and I
[49:52] even had an inkling that I'm one of
[49:53] those that's going to be caught up and
[49:56] defy that God is going to defy the power
[49:59] of death. You ought to be a rejoicing
[50:01] people today. You ought to you ought to
[50:04] be able to express your liberty
[50:07] &gt;&gt; that that here's a people that actually
[50:09] believes they're going to uh they're
[50:11] going to bypass death. That death on
[50:14] their behalf is going to be rendered
[50:16] inefficient.
[50:18] &gt;&gt; Inactive.
[50:25] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. to abolish,
[50:28] to cease, to be done away, to be severed
[50:32] from. Oh, my brother, my sister, I I
[50:38] can't wait for the day when I enter into
[50:41] that realm, enter into that place. And I
[50:44] don't think it's somewhere far in the
[50:46] distance. I believe it's right here.
[50:48] This God that made this word, sent this
[50:51] word, sent forth Jesus Christ, anointed
[50:54] these apostles, took took the Apostle
[50:57] Paul into the third heaven so he could
[50:59] write about these things. He knows
[51:01] something about the last enemy that's
[51:02] going to be destroyed is death.
[51:05] &gt;&gt; And I draw on the God that wrote this
[51:08] word.
[51:11] &gt;&gt; We draw on him. He's all around.
[51:13] &gt;&gt; He's right where you are now. say all
[51:16] you have to do is exercise faith in what
[51:18] he says so that that presence can come
[51:20] to you. Now I want to bring it very near
[51:22] to you. It's all around you. You just
[51:25] have to absorb it
[51:27] &gt;&gt; by the word and by faith. You have
[51:29] faith. Just absorb it so it can come
[51:32] into your heart,
[51:33] &gt;&gt; into your being, even into your body and
[51:36] into your mind.
[51:38] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[51:42] the anointing of the Holy Spirit.
[51:45] Now, the anointing of the Holy Spirit,
[51:48] it is not something that's very well
[51:50] understood. And that's why I thought
[51:52] that I would go into it with some in
[51:54] some depth this morning.
[51:57] One of the reasons why it is not really
[51:59] understood,
[52:01] anointing is something that comes from
[52:04] the eastern culture.
[52:06] It is not part of western culture. And
[52:09] so we have a a really a wide array of of
[52:14] thought of what the anointing is. Oh,
[52:17] that was sure an anointed song. What do
[52:19] you mean? Oh, wasn't he anointed when he
[52:22] spoke?
[52:24] Define that for me. You'd have a hard
[52:27] time. Well, you say, well, it came
[52:29] across with such power. I know all kinds
[52:31] of inspirational speakers that come
[52:34] across with power.
[52:36] I know people, gifted people. I know
[52:38] people that just have a natural talent
[52:40] of having control of of they know how to
[52:43] do it. They're not anointed. I used to
[52:45] be in the auction business. I I I know
[52:47] what a what an auctioneer can say, "Oh,
[52:49] what an anointed auctioneer. Why?" Well,
[52:51] because he got good prices for
[52:53] everything. Doesn't mean he was
[52:55] anointed. That's what What is the
[52:57] anointing? He just had a natural talent
[52:59] to pull the money out of the people's
[53:01] pocketbook.
[53:03] Oh, that was such an anointed song. What
[53:06] was it? Because it was the volume
[53:08] because they knew how to handle the mic
[53:11] or they knew how to play. That was such
[53:13] an anointed piece. What was it? I know I
[53:16] kind of got you baffled. That's just
[53:17] what I want to do.
[53:24] We're acquainted with the phrase
[53:28] of the anointing,
[53:30] but it's important we really know what
[53:31] we ask for when we say, "Lord, anoint
[53:35] me,"
[53:37] what are we saying? What are we asking
[53:38] for? What are we actually even
[53:40] expecting?
[53:45] So God has used, and I'm just going to
[53:48] take it very quickly, going to move it
[53:50] through the scripture, but God has taken
[53:53] what was an eastern custom and not
[53:56] unique to the Jews alone or to the
[53:58] Hebrews. It was an eastern custom and I
[54:02] won't spend a lot of time on this but to
[54:05] anoint as far as the Hebrew terminology
[54:08] is concerned. It was to actually smear
[54:13] or usually with oil anointment over an
[54:18] object or on an object and that was to
[54:21] anoint that object uh with as I said
[54:25] usually an oil and then it had the
[54:28] connotation that you were consecrating
[54:30] it. it it was being set aside or this
[54:33] was a special this had a special meaning
[54:36] and they'd actually put an oil on
[54:38] something and I found in India which in
[54:41] a heathen heathen practice for I was in
[54:44] a in a temple I believe that's what
[54:47] where you were brother David and and the
[54:50] brothers uh and we did the video and we
[54:54] got special permission there was a lot
[54:56] of high priestesses women that were uh
[55:00] uh that were there in charge of doing a
[55:02] lot of things. And so we got into an
[55:04] area that the average person doesn't get
[55:07] into, just the worshippers. And the
[55:10] people that belong to that particular uh
[55:12] it was indeed a cult. And so we we got
[55:15] in there and and there was a little
[55:17] building, a little room, and the people
[55:19] were just looking. They because they
[55:20] couldn't draw near to it because that
[55:22] was their holy of holies. The whole
[55:25] thing is, you know, Satan, he copies and
[55:29] impersonates the genuine. And in this
[55:32] holy of holies was a was a stone. And uh
[55:36] so I queried what was so special about
[55:39] this stone. And they were smearing oil
[55:42] over this stone and they with their
[55:44] hands and anointing this stone because
[55:47] this was such a sacred sacred spot. This
[55:50] was their holy of holies.
[55:53] So I said what is special about this
[55:56] stone? Well, it is said that a great
[55:59] storm
[56:00] came through here and when the storm
[56:03] came through here here the stone
[56:06] appeared out of the out of the ground
[56:10] and then he built this whole thing. This
[56:13] temple was mammoth and they had uh tens
[56:17] of thousands of people would walk even
[56:20] up to 400 kilometers about 240 50 miles
[56:25] would walk and we saw them on the road
[56:27] walking to come to this place. It was
[56:30] just unbelievable the amount of uh
[56:34] influence that they had. I invited them
[56:37] to come to Saskatchewan where I could
[56:39] show them where strong winds had left
[56:41] lots of stones up above the ground and
[56:44] they would have all kinds of stones to
[56:46] put oil on them if they wanted to
[56:49] or the Midwest or some places that you
[56:51] know Eastern Oregon has them stones all
[56:55] over it. Look just like all kinds of
[56:57] stones I had but there they were uh
[57:00] smearing this oil over it. But in the
[57:03] Bible, some of the first instances we
[57:06] find Jacob,
[57:09] Jacob anointed a pillar. The Bible says
[57:11] there was a pillar. And I looked to see
[57:14] what the Hebrew term was for that
[57:17] pillar. It said it was probably wood,
[57:20] something like a a stump. And and uh
[57:24] Jacob anointed that pillar in a place
[57:27] where he had met with God. Then Moses
[57:30] was commanded by God to have spices and
[57:34] these spices were for the anointing oil
[57:38] and so that the anointing oil now would
[57:40] become fragrant. And it is in Exodus 25
[57:44] and6 and oil for the light spices for
[57:48] the anointing oil and for sweet incense.
[57:52] And then the act of anointing took on a
[57:56] new significance. It became it it it it
[57:59] began to be shaped differently in the
[58:02] minds of the people because God was
[58:04] moving something they were familiar with
[58:07] and giving it more significance and more
[58:10] spiritual application and meaning all
[58:12] the time. And now God commanded Moses
[58:16] that he should anoint now the sons of
[58:19] Aaron. And so now it was going not just
[58:23] from a stump or from a stone or from
[58:25] something else or to anoint a special
[58:28] place, but now he said, "Now you've got
[58:31] this oil and this fragrant oil and
[58:34] you've got spices for the oil. Now
[58:36] you'll anoint the sons of Aaron.
[58:40] And thou shalt put upon them upon Aaron
[58:44] thy brother and his sons with him. Thou
[58:46] shalt anoint them and consecrate them.
[58:51] Because now the act of anointing them
[58:54] was indicative that they were being set
[58:56] aside for a special purpose, for a
[59:00] special ministry, that this act of
[59:04] anointing them, set them aside from all
[59:07] the others that were of the people. and
[59:11] you will anoint them, consecrate them,
[59:13] and sanctify them that they may minister
[59:16] unto me in the priest's office. And so
[59:18] now you have to see that a very
[59:21] important thing here that's going to
[59:23] that is going to take place in the next
[59:25] two three scriptures is that the
[59:27] anointing of the people was setting them
[59:30] aside to a to a special office uh a
[59:34] special ministry or a special position
[59:38] that God was giving them and that and
[59:41] the go and God says that they may
[59:44] minister unto me in the priest's office.
[59:47] So you have to see that the act of
[59:50] anointing them was something that God
[59:53] Almighty was going to acknowledge.
[59:56] If they were not anointed, there's
[59:58] nothing for God to respond to. So you'll
[1:00:01] anoint them that they may minister unto
[1:00:04] me. And God was going to acknowledge
[1:00:06] that that they would they would then be
[1:00:09] in the priest's office.
[1:00:13] And then it moves moves further. It
[1:00:16] takes on increasing significance in uh
[1:00:19] Exodus 29 and 7.
[1:00:22] Thou shalt take the anointing oil and
[1:00:25] pour it upon the head. This was upon the
[1:00:29] head of Aaron. Now, it's not just anoint
[1:00:32] his sons, but now you'll take this
[1:00:34] anointing oil and you're going to pour
[1:00:37] it on the head of Aaron, the high
[1:00:40] priest, and anoint and appoint him.
[1:00:44] because now he would become the high
[1:00:48] priest. And so the anointing takes on
[1:00:51] even a greater a greater significance at
[1:00:55] this time.
[1:00:56] Then it moves even further. Are you with
[1:01:00] me?
[1:01:02] &gt;&gt; Then God said, "Now you will anoint the
[1:01:04] altar."
[1:01:06] There's objects that are special within
[1:01:10] the temple or the tabernacle that was
[1:01:12] built. I want you to anoint the altar.
[1:01:16] And it was the same thing. Anoint them
[1:01:18] with oil. Then we move further through
[1:01:21] the scripture. And when God was telling
[1:01:24] Samuel how that he shall select a king
[1:01:28] for Israel, Saul had been selected, Saul
[1:01:33] had fallen away and backsliden in a into
[1:01:36] a a state that was displeasing to God.
[1:01:40] And God said to Samuel, "You go," and he
[1:01:44] directed him to go to the house of
[1:01:46] Jesse, and you will take anointing oil,
[1:01:49] take the horn of anointing with you
[1:01:52] because now you're going to anoint a
[1:01:55] king.
[1:01:56] Not just a priest or the high priest,
[1:01:58] but now you're going to anoint a king.
[1:02:02] And a supernatural event is taking place
[1:02:07] actually when the anointing takes place.
[1:02:09] So on earth there's a horn of oil that's
[1:02:12] being poured onto an individual. But in
[1:02:15] the mind of God, God already from the
[1:02:18] foundation of the world had chosen this
[1:02:20] young strippling of a boy that he'll
[1:02:23] have a kingdom and his kingdom will
[1:02:25] never never pass away. And I'm going to
[1:02:28] give something out of my loins to be his
[1:02:31] son. He'll be called the son of David.
[1:02:34] This anointing was not a light thing,
[1:02:36] friends. And this anointing was moving a
[1:02:39] young shepherd boy from the position of
[1:02:41] being a shepherd boy, actually
[1:02:44] transferring him into a kingly position,
[1:02:47] a kingly role, a kingly office, and he
[1:02:50] was anointed, although he was still a
[1:02:52] young lad.
[1:02:55] But as far as God was concerned, he was
[1:02:57] already in another position.
[1:03:00] It's important you get this now. As far
[1:03:02] as God was concerned, when that
[1:03:04] anointing was poured out, it already
[1:03:06] happened.
[1:03:08] &gt;&gt; It couldn't be reversed. God wouldn't
[1:03:10] take it back.
[1:03:12] &gt;&gt; He never would send his prophet and say,
[1:03:13] "Take it back.
[1:03:15] &gt;&gt; Go and retrieve that oil that you
[1:03:17] poured. I made a mistake." No, you
[1:03:19] anoint him.
[1:03:21] &gt;&gt; He is the one I've chosen.
[1:03:23] And so Samuel is there and the boys
[1:03:25] start to come by strong.
[1:03:29] Oh, beautiful of stature. And Samuel
[1:03:32] even himself was impressed. This must be
[1:03:35] him. It's not him. The next one, the
[1:03:39] next one. All of them come by. Samuel is
[1:03:42] sure that some of these fine young men
[1:03:46] are the one to be anointed king.
[1:03:50] He has to ask the father,
[1:03:52] "Don't you have a Isn't there another
[1:03:54] one?"
[1:03:56] Well, yeah. Yeah, there is. He's out
[1:03:58] actually out looking after the sheep.
[1:04:02] Call him.
[1:04:04] In comes this ruddy little fellow.
[1:04:07] Maybe had a slingshot hanging down on
[1:04:10] his side from his belt,
[1:04:14] bewildered of what is happening.
[1:04:17] And the and the scripture says
[1:04:20] this is him.
[1:04:23] &gt;&gt; This is him chosen of him. Anoint him.
[1:04:27] And the Bible says, "Then Samuel took
[1:04:30] the horn of oil and anointed him in the
[1:04:34] midst of his brethren. and the spirit.
[1:04:37] Notice now and ha and and Samuel took
[1:04:41] the horn of oil in the midst of his
[1:04:44] brethren and anointed him and the spirit
[1:04:49] of the Lord came upon David from that
[1:04:53] day forward.
[1:04:56] &gt;&gt; So Samuel rose up and went to Rama.
[1:05:01] So now almighty God, the very spirit of
[1:05:06] God
[1:05:07] is now being moved.
[1:05:11] Is now
[1:05:13] is now in motion just by the simple act.
[1:05:17] It's come a long ways, friends. Come a
[1:05:19] long ways from putting some oil on a
[1:05:21] stump. It's come a long ways.
[1:05:24] Do you agree?
[1:05:26] &gt;&gt; You see that? It's it's a it's a moving
[1:05:29] it's it's a it's a moving uh teaching.
[1:05:32] It's a moving doctrine. It's something
[1:05:34] that God had in his mind and it is
[1:05:38] increasing in its magnitude and now in
[1:05:42] fact is this became so significant with
[1:05:45] the people of the Hebrews is that the
[1:05:49] word anointed
[1:05:51] is is a synonym of king. When you say
[1:05:55] anointed, they think of king right away.
[1:06:00] It's synonymous with kingship.
[1:06:03] And thus we come now to the term the
[1:06:08] anointed
[1:06:09] one,
[1:06:11] the Messiah,
[1:06:14] the anointed one. And they knew that
[1:06:18] that who is the anointed one must be
[1:06:22] king.
[1:06:24] That's why he was called when he came.
[1:06:27] This is Jesus, the king of the Jews.
[1:06:31] Jesus, thou son of David, have mercy on
[1:06:35] me. There was something of that was
[1:06:38] kingly about him, his demeanor,
[1:06:43] his power. Which king did they have that
[1:06:46] fed 5,000
[1:06:48] out of a basket of loaves and fishes?
[1:06:52] This is a kind of king we want who heals
[1:06:54] the blind and causes the lame to walk.
[1:06:58] What king did we ever have? Saul didn't
[1:07:01] do it. Solomon didn't do it. But we have
[1:07:03] a king now. Jesus, the son of David,
[1:07:07] that is doing these things, manifesting
[1:07:09] something, and it moved them.
[1:07:15] And here is really the depth. I want you
[1:07:18] to catch this before I continue.
[1:07:22] among the Hebrews.
[1:07:24] It was believed
[1:07:28] it was not only that it it affected that
[1:07:31] anointing that it affected a
[1:07:34] transference
[1:07:36] to the anointed one
[1:07:39] of something of the holiness
[1:07:42] and the virtue
[1:07:44] of the deity in whose name and by whose
[1:07:48] representative the right the right the
[1:07:52] act of anointing was performed. formed.
[1:07:55] So now when Samuel, he's the
[1:07:58] representative
[1:08:00] and he has gone by commission to a
[1:08:03] certain house
[1:08:05] of a certain lineage
[1:08:07] to a certain people.
[1:08:10] He's gone by divine
[1:08:13] uh direction guided by the God that he's
[1:08:17] a representative of to a certain place
[1:08:21] to wait for a certain boy, a certain son
[1:08:26] that has certain seed within him and are
[1:08:29] going to anoint him and as the king of
[1:08:34] Israel. And so the Hebrews believe that
[1:08:38] the deity the God that this prophet
[1:08:42] represented when he did the act that
[1:08:46] there was something actually at that
[1:08:48] moment transferred. They believed that
[1:08:52] that there was something transferred
[1:08:54] from the deity to the individual by the
[1:08:58] act of the anointing.
[1:09:00] &gt;&gt; Oh,
[1:09:01] I hope you have spiritual minds.
[1:09:07] I want to really dwell on this point.
[1:09:10] The transfer,
[1:09:12] the transferal
[1:09:14] of holiness,
[1:09:16] the transferral of righteousness, of
[1:09:20] virtue and of special endowment by the
[1:09:24] Holy Spirit. If you have the right
[1:09:27] representative
[1:09:30] &gt;&gt; and that that representative has come to
[1:09:33] the right people,
[1:09:36] Then the very act of his pouring out
[1:09:40] &gt;&gt; has a divine effect
[1:09:42] &gt;&gt; upon a specific group.
[1:09:47] &gt;&gt; It didn't mean anything to a lot of
[1:09:49] miracle seekers.
[1:09:53] &gt;&gt; It didn't have an effect.
[1:09:56] But as soon as uh David was there, the
[1:09:59] right representative, the prophet of
[1:10:01] God, come to the right house, to the
[1:10:04] right people, to the elected one. Then
[1:10:08] he took what he had, what he had been
[1:10:10] given, what he had been uh uh entrusted
[1:10:14] with and poured it out on that people,
[1:10:18] and a divine thing took place.
[1:10:26] In the message, why are people so tossed
[1:10:28] about?
[1:10:30] Brother Brandham says, "Some people get
[1:10:32] the wrong impression of what the
[1:10:34] anointing is."
[1:10:36] Did you ever think of that? When was the
[1:10:39] greatest anointing ever give to anyone?
[1:10:42] And what did they do when they had the
[1:10:46] anointing?
[1:10:47] The greatest anointing that was ever
[1:10:49] given to anyone was Jesus Christ.
[1:10:53] We have the spirit by measure. He had it
[1:10:56] without measure. And one day he entered
[1:10:59] into the temple and picked up the scroll
[1:11:02] to read. The spirit of God is upon me.
[1:11:06] He has anointed me to preach the go
[1:11:08] preach the acceptable year and to bind
[1:11:11] up the broken hearts and to heal the
[1:11:14] sick and give sight to the blind. And
[1:11:16] now we would think if such an anointing
[1:11:19] was on him that had been prophesied 800
[1:11:23] years before that it would come. And
[1:11:26] here he was with the type of anointing
[1:11:29] with that type of anointing the full
[1:11:33] blessing the anointing of the Lord upon
[1:11:36] him. Are you listening? We would want to
[1:11:39] run. He said we would want to run all
[1:11:41] over the building and scream and holler.
[1:11:44] But the Bible said he laid down the
[1:11:47] scroll
[1:11:48] and went and sat down
[1:11:51] and precious words proceeded from his
[1:11:55] mouth. He said that's what he did under
[1:11:58] the anointing.
[1:12:03] &gt;&gt; The anointing, he said, is not an
[1:12:05] emotion.
[1:12:06] The anointing is supreme power in
[1:12:11] control.
[1:12:13] The anointing is supreme power in
[1:12:17] control.
[1:12:19] &gt;&gt; He said like knowing exactly
[1:12:22] what and how
[1:12:25] and that's what's here.
[1:12:29] He said like exactly knowing what and
[1:12:31] how.
[1:12:32] He hesitates and that's he said what's
[1:12:35] here because God had sent a special
[1:12:39] anointing.
[1:12:41] And so the scripture which we read and
[1:12:43] when Jesus said the spirit of the Lord
[1:12:45] is upon me because he hath the Lord hath
[1:12:49] anointed me and I like you now to notice
[1:12:51] what the Lord had anointed him for
[1:12:55] to preach good tidings
[1:12:57] unto the meek. Number one,
[1:13:01] to bind up the brokenhearted. Number
[1:13:03] two, to proclaim liberty to the
[1:13:07] captives. Number three,
[1:13:10] and the opening of the prison to them
[1:13:12] that are bound. Number four,
[1:13:15] and to proclaim the acceptable year of
[1:13:18] the Lord. Number five, and that is when
[1:13:22] he closed the book
[1:13:26] to preach the acceptable year of the
[1:13:29] Lord. He's anointed me. And that is
[1:13:32] where now from Hebrew we come to the
[1:13:35] Greek Christos
[1:13:37] or Messias is where it comes from.
[1:13:41] Consecrating Jesus to the Messiah office
[1:13:45] and furnishing him with the necessary
[1:13:48] powers for the administration.
[1:13:51] And then in Acts it says of Christ of
[1:13:54] this how God
[1:13:56] anointed Jesus of Nazareth. And now this
[1:14:00] is being spoken to them that did not
[1:14:02] really believe, but how God anointed
[1:14:05] Jesus of Nazareth with the Holy Ghost
[1:14:08] and with power, who went about doing
[1:14:11] good and healing all that were oppressed
[1:14:13] of the devil. For God was with him.
[1:14:20] You know, it takes the anointing.
[1:14:23] It's not enough just to get up and
[1:14:25] preach. But the scripture says that
[1:14:28] Jesus, he declared the Lord hath
[1:14:32] anointed me.
[1:14:35] And if it takes the anointing
[1:14:37] on Jesus Christ, the son of God, to
[1:14:40] preach, it sure takes it for us poor
[1:14:43] humans.
[1:14:45] &gt;&gt; It's not some ability, human ability,
[1:14:47] some talent. I got a gift with words.
[1:14:50] That has nothing to do with it. It takes
[1:14:52] the anointing
[1:14:54] &gt;&gt; even if a person hasn't got a gift of
[1:14:56] words.
[1:14:57] &gt;&gt; I think of Smith Wigglesworth.
[1:15:01] A plumber
[1:15:03] past 40 years old and his wife was the
[1:15:06] preacher. She was the one gifted with
[1:15:09] words.
[1:15:11] She was the one who really led the way
[1:15:13] in the home spiritually speaking. And
[1:15:17] Smith Wigglesworth was just a plumber.
[1:15:20] But one day the Holy Spirit came on him
[1:15:24] and he became filled with the Holy
[1:15:26] Ghost. He became sealed with God. And I
[1:15:30] can say that that sealing on him, God
[1:15:33] transferred something divine into that
[1:15:37] man and he became known as the apostle
[1:15:39] of faith. Amen.
[1:15:44] &gt;&gt; He was sent of the Holy Spirit to a
[1:15:47] place and a woman had died and she was
[1:15:50] on a slab
[1:15:53] and he knew he'd been sent there to
[1:15:55] raise her from the dead and he commanded
[1:15:58] her in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ
[1:16:00] to rise and walk and zero nothing
[1:16:04] happened.
[1:16:07] The report is he took her by the
[1:16:09] shoulders
[1:16:11] and stood her up against the wall and he
[1:16:14] said, "I said walk and let go and she
[1:16:17] walked."
[1:16:20] &gt;&gt; Apostle of faith.
[1:16:22] &gt;&gt; Mighty man of God. Brother Brandon
[1:16:25] mentioned his name to me and he died in
[1:16:27] 1949. Brother Brandon was saying how
[1:16:29] that ministry was just fading out when
[1:16:31] other was coming in.
[1:16:33] &gt;&gt; Different kind of a ministry.
[1:16:39] And then now we have the anointing has
[1:16:43] moved all the way
[1:16:45] to the uh thought and the understanding
[1:16:48] that we have that the Messiah is the
[1:16:51] anointed one.
[1:16:54] And they knew that it was associated
[1:16:56] with kingship,
[1:16:58] the anointed one.
[1:17:01] You know, brother Brandham talks about
[1:17:03] the sign of Messiah
[1:17:05] over 300 times.
[1:17:08] He makes the reference to the sign of
[1:17:10] the Messiah.
[1:17:14] Abraham knew that there was something
[1:17:16] special
[1:17:18] when this visitor
[1:17:21] who he had revealed to him were not was
[1:17:24] none other than Lord. And he uses the
[1:17:26] term Lord.
[1:17:28] But when that visitor said, "Where's
[1:17:30] Sarah thy wife?"
[1:17:32] &gt;&gt; He knew this is a different visitation.
[1:17:35] &gt;&gt; Even though he has not moved through all
[1:17:37] this process that I have just in my
[1:17:41] weakness given to you today of the
[1:17:43] anointing, but he knew that this was
[1:17:45] different. He knew this was a different
[1:17:47] sign. He had never encountered this
[1:17:49] before. Where's Sarah, your wife?
[1:17:52] &gt;&gt; She's in the tent behind you. I will
[1:17:56] certainly visit her according to the
[1:17:58] time of life and she shall have a son
[1:18:02] &gt;&gt; and she laughs in the tent. He knew that
[1:18:06] was a special sign. Why did Sarah laugh?
[1:18:10] She says in her heart I didn't laugh.
[1:18:11] But you did.
[1:18:15] This was now a revealing of the secret
[1:18:19] of the heart. This had never happened in
[1:18:21] Abraham's life.
[1:18:24] This one that's standing before me is
[1:18:26] revealing the secret of my wife's heart
[1:18:29] in the tent behind him. This is a
[1:18:32] special sign.
[1:18:34] &gt;&gt; And he believed the sign. He believed
[1:18:37] the sign. He believed that one. And a
[1:18:40] prophet comes in the end time. You've
[1:18:42] never heard it before. He said that was
[1:18:44] Elohim standing before him. Elohim in a
[1:18:48] body revealing the secret of the heart.
[1:18:51] &gt;&gt; It was a sign. It was a sign that would
[1:18:54] be projected into the future of the
[1:18:56] Messiah sign be the sign of Messiah.
[1:19:01] &gt;&gt; Do you know that people live for
[1:19:03] centuries and never saw it and never
[1:19:07] heard of it? They didn't even know it
[1:19:09] existed. Do you know that there's
[1:19:11] multitudes just like you that God didn't
[1:19:15] even allow to hear a word about that? Do
[1:19:19] you know there's a multitude of people
[1:19:21] untold millions and hundreds of millions
[1:19:24] and perhaps into the billions that never
[1:19:27] even heard or knew the concept that
[1:19:30] there's such a thing as an anointed one,
[1:19:35] &gt;&gt; a Messiah.
[1:19:38] Here you have it on your shelves. You
[1:19:40] have it in your books. You have it by
[1:19:43] voice. You have the evidence of it. I
[1:19:45] tell you friends, there's no time for us
[1:19:47] to sit idly by because God's going to
[1:19:50] hold us accountable. What did I send
[1:19:52] you?
[1:19:54] &gt;&gt; What did I send you? I sent you the sign
[1:19:56] of Messiah.
[1:20:00] &gt;&gt; Furthermore, friends, he what is this
[1:20:04] generation going to be accountable for?
[1:20:06] He sent you and I the sign of the
[1:20:09] resurrection.
[1:20:11] &gt;&gt; If there's anybody believes in a
[1:20:12] rapture, it should be us. There's
[1:20:14] anybody who believes in the change of
[1:20:16] the body, it should be us.
[1:20:18] &gt;&gt; We've received an undisputable sign of
[1:20:21] the resurrection.
[1:20:25] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:20:26] &gt;&gt; There's been healing, all kinds of
[1:20:28] healings that have taken place under all
[1:20:30] these different ministries. But healing
[1:20:33] under this ministry has a different
[1:20:35] scope
[1:20:36] &gt;&gt; because it is it is a healing under a
[1:20:39] particular called representative
[1:20:42] &gt;&gt; that had a particular sign. And so he
[1:20:46] could say about healing under this sign
[1:20:48] that that healing is the token evidence
[1:20:51] of the resurrection.
[1:20:55] It may not have been that under other
[1:20:57] ministries
[1:21:00] because that had not been what had been
[1:21:01] poured out, but what had been poured out
[1:21:04] now was not only just supernatural
[1:21:07] signs. And thus those that went after
[1:21:10] the signs
[1:21:11] never received what was actually poured
[1:21:14] out.
[1:21:22] the woman at the well.
[1:21:25] How many times you've heard it and how
[1:21:27] many times it's so common to us. But the
[1:21:30] woman said unto him, speaking to Jesus,
[1:21:34] I know that the Messiah's cometh,
[1:21:38] which is called Christ. I know the
[1:21:42] anointed one is coming.
[1:21:45] &gt;&gt; Oh my. Think about the scene
[1:21:50] she was at that moment
[1:21:53] as some that perhaps are here today.
[1:22:00] I know there's something supposed to
[1:22:02] happen,
[1:22:04] but they don't realize
[1:22:06] that the very one who's going to cause
[1:22:09] it to happen is right in their presence
[1:22:12] at that moment.
[1:22:15] I know when the Messiah cometh,
[1:22:21] he will tell us.
[1:22:24] He will tell us all things. He'll
[1:22:27] certainly reveal a secret of the heart.
[1:22:30] And she already had been told,
[1:22:33] "You've had five husbands and the one
[1:22:35] you're with now is not your husband."
[1:22:38] &gt;&gt; That smote her.
[1:22:42] &gt;&gt; That is the truth.
[1:22:45] She knew that was a sign of Messiah.
[1:22:49] I know when the Messiah cometh, he'll
[1:22:52] tell us all these things.
[1:22:57] Went into a city and the only thing
[1:22:59] Jesus had said to her, you've had five
[1:23:01] husbands and the one you have now is not
[1:23:02] your husband. But she went into the city
[1:23:05] and the and the the whole realization
[1:23:08] that she had was come and see a man that
[1:23:10] told me all that ever I did. In other
[1:23:14] words, when he spoke that her whole life
[1:23:16] was exposed.
[1:23:19] How many times we've even had people
[1:23:20] come into church into right here and and
[1:23:23] and and the the minister, whoever it
[1:23:26] might be, in a simplicity
[1:23:28] preaches the word of God and that
[1:23:31] individual and you've experienced it.
[1:23:33] Who told him everything?
[1:23:35] &gt;&gt; Who told him all about my life? Who
[1:23:37] exposed me like that? The same Messiah.
[1:23:41] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:23:42] &gt;&gt; And that's why the prophet of God says
[1:23:45] if you had an angel that come from
[1:23:46] heaven or an angel standing at the
[1:23:48] pulpit, which one's the greater? He said
[1:23:50] the angel at the pulpit is greater.
[1:23:54] &gt;&gt; You think I have to make much something
[1:23:55] out of myself? I don't have to make
[1:23:56] anything out of myself at all. That's
[1:23:58] what a prophet said. You either take
[1:23:59] what he said or just forget it.
[1:24:03] Amen.
[1:24:04] &gt;&gt; Right now, as of this moment,
[1:24:07] if an angel from God came from heaven
[1:24:09] sinless and stood here beside this
[1:24:12] pulpit, I know you would be distracted.
[1:24:15] But if you really believed what a
[1:24:16] messenger said, you'd say, "The one that
[1:24:19] is the most important to me right now is
[1:24:21] the one behind the pulpit. The one
[1:24:23] that's been redeemed, the one that knew
[1:24:26] sin, the one that's been made spotless
[1:24:29] by the blood of the lamb. And the one
[1:24:31] he's he's giving the horn of oils been
[1:24:33] poured upon him for this service to this
[1:24:37] people. And I am that person."
[1:24:41] &gt;&gt; That's the only way you can get it.
[1:24:44] That's when you really get something.
[1:24:47] &gt;&gt; And yet on the other hand, we're just
[1:24:50] brothers and sisters.
[1:24:53] &gt;&gt; I'm absolutely nothing. And you're
[1:24:56] nothing without him.
[1:24:57] &gt;&gt; But with him, we all have our place.
[1:25:00] &gt;&gt; Have our place.
[1:25:02] &gt;&gt; Isn't that wonderful?
[1:25:03] &gt;&gt; You believe that?
[1:25:06] &gt;&gt; The sign of Messiah.
[1:25:08] The sign of Messiah was Nathaniel.
[1:25:12] In John 1, Nathaniel answered and said
[1:25:14] unto him, Jesus just said,
[1:25:19] "Before Philip called you when you were
[1:25:21] under the fig tree, I saw you."
[1:25:25] That's not a big profound sermon, is it?
[1:25:29] You say, "Well, what what could happen
[1:25:30] out of that?"
[1:25:33] before just as common as before the
[1:25:36] brother or before the sister came to you
[1:25:38] yesterday
[1:25:40] and said certain things to you.
[1:25:45] You say, "Well, my that was just I was
[1:25:47] just in the house or I was just outside.
[1:25:49] I was under a tree.
[1:25:53] I was just doing something." But he
[1:25:55] realized the one speaking to him
[1:25:58] knew what happened yesterday.
[1:26:01] &gt;&gt; And that was enough. He didn't need
[1:26:03] sermons. He didn't need a wall of books
[1:26:05] or tapes.
[1:26:07] &gt;&gt; He identified the sign.
[1:26:09] &gt;&gt; That's a sign. Wow. That's a sign of
[1:26:12] Messiah.
[1:26:14] &gt;&gt; And with that, he makes a declaration.
[1:26:19] You're the son of God.
[1:26:24] You're a rabbi.
[1:26:26] Thou art the son of God.
[1:26:29] Notice now, thou art the king
[1:26:32] &gt;&gt; of Israel.
[1:26:34] &gt;&gt; You're the anointed one. And the
[1:26:36] anointed one is a synonym of the king.
[1:26:39] You're the He says, "Rabbi, thou the son
[1:26:42] of God. Thou the king of Israel. You're
[1:26:45] the anointed one. I see the sign of
[1:26:48] Messiah
[1:26:50] &gt;&gt; for my time.
[1:26:52] &gt;&gt; And just that one thing turned Nathaniel
[1:26:57] into a believer.
[1:27:01] And quickly
[1:27:03] in a revelation of Jesus Christ series,
[1:27:07] the prophet says they knew that he was a
[1:27:09] prophet. They knew the sign of the
[1:27:12] Messiah would come only through the
[1:27:15] prophet.
[1:27:16] That was John 41. John 1:41 speaking of
[1:27:20] Nathaniel
[1:27:21] in the message of Queen of Sheba. He
[1:27:24] said, "What was Jonah?" A sign of the
[1:27:27] resurrection.
[1:27:29] Hallelujah. The resurrection. And that's
[1:27:32] the thing we're seeing now, the sign of
[1:27:35] the resurrection. Telling people 40
[1:27:38] years ago, what you're seeing right now
[1:27:42] is the sign of the resurrection.
[1:27:47] And greater than Solomon is here says in
[1:27:50] this generation has to receive the sign
[1:27:53] of the resurrection to dovetail with my
[1:27:57] last night's sermon of the signs that he
[1:28:00] did then. He spoke that message of the
[1:28:02] signs that he did then. and he's never
[1:28:04] done them since in all the age until the
[1:28:09] closing of the gentile dispensation and
[1:28:13] that we're now living in in this wicked
[1:28:16] and adulterous generation.
[1:28:19] &gt;&gt; This Christrejecting generation has
[1:28:22] received not will has received the sign
[1:28:26] of the resurrection.
[1:28:28] &gt;&gt; Listen to it. The last sign
[1:28:31] &gt;&gt; to the church.
[1:28:34] said there won't be another one.
[1:28:42] &gt;&gt; This wicked and adulterous generation
[1:28:44] seeketh after a sign. Jesus said,
[1:28:48] brother Brandham said the sign of the
[1:28:51] resurrection, this is greater than
[1:28:52] Solomon is here. Says you get it. the
[1:28:57] sign of the resurrection.
[1:29:00] Christ alive
[1:29:02] &gt;&gt; tonight amongst us doing the same things
[1:29:06] that he did.
[1:29:08] &gt;&gt; Did a wicked and adulterous generation
[1:29:10] receive it? No. But he wasn't sent to a
[1:29:13] wicked and adulterous generation. The
[1:29:16] sign and that anointing that came with
[1:29:19] the sign was sent to a certain
[1:29:21] household,
[1:29:22] &gt;&gt; to a certain place,
[1:29:24] &gt;&gt; to a certain person. Amen.
[1:29:26] &gt;&gt; No, it's not this one. It's not this
[1:29:28] one. Maybe you had a prayer card. You
[1:29:29] were called in the prayer line. You
[1:29:31] lived in that day, but I was one that
[1:29:33] never saw it. I was one that never heard
[1:29:35] it. But now, now you come by and you're
[1:29:38] you're gripped by it and you stop.
[1:29:42] &gt;&gt; What is this?
[1:29:43] &gt;&gt; Who is this?
[1:29:45] &gt;&gt; This has a different sound because it
[1:29:48] was sent to you and God had ordained
[1:29:51] before the foundation of the world. Take
[1:29:54] the horn
[1:29:55] &gt;&gt; of oil. Take the message and pour it on
[1:29:59] them.
[1:30:04] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:30:05] &gt;&gt; And it wasn't something that just went
[1:30:07] on the head. But Apostle John had the
[1:30:10] revelation when he said, "And you have
[1:30:13] received an uncction.
[1:30:16] You have received an anointing in verse
[1:30:18] 27 that is abiding with you and is in
[1:30:23] you.
[1:30:25] &gt;&gt; You have received it.
[1:30:28] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:30:32] &gt;&gt; An uncction not from a man.
[1:30:36] &gt;&gt; David the strippling boy could have
[1:30:38] said, "Where did the oil come from?"
[1:30:41] Well, the oil come from the olive oil
[1:30:45] press, I suppose. Where did this man
[1:30:47] come from? I don't know him. I only know
[1:30:50] he's the prophet. He's the one that has
[1:30:53] it. He's the representative. But it's
[1:30:55] not just a representative. He could have
[1:30:57] said it came from came from Samuel.
[1:31:01] Didn't come from him.
[1:31:03] &gt;&gt; He w Samuel wouldn't even be there.
[1:31:06] &gt;&gt; He wouldn't even have a horn. He
[1:31:09] wouldn't have oil in the horn unless
[1:31:11] there was someone else who he was
[1:31:13] representing. Go to that place. Go to
[1:31:17] that town. Go to that house. Go to that
[1:31:20] factory. Go to that store. Buy that
[1:31:23] house. That neighbor needs it. Ride that
[1:31:26] bus.
[1:31:27] Talk to that man. Sit on this seat in
[1:31:30] the airplane. Hallelujah. I got a
[1:31:33] message. You received an anointing and
[1:31:35] it's in you. It's an uncction. You've
[1:31:37] got to speak.
[1:31:40] [Music]
[1:31:42] &gt;&gt; I'm sent to this house. I'm sent to this
[1:31:45] person.
[1:31:48] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. I have their lineage written
[1:31:51] in my book, in my home in heaven. I have
[1:31:55] their name. And you're sent to them.
[1:32:00] [Music]
[1:32:01] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:32:07] The uncction,
[1:32:14] the anointing,
[1:32:17] it's been sent.
[1:32:20] I want to just take a few moments now.
[1:32:25] I want to make this statement. The horn
[1:32:30] of God's message
[1:32:33] poured out.
[1:32:35] That would be a good message title.
[1:32:38] The horn
[1:32:40] of God's message poured out
[1:32:45] in the message. Blasphemous names.
[1:32:47] Notice the message. Blasphemous names.
[1:32:51] Multitudes,
[1:32:53] all kinds of church groups and whatever
[1:32:58] making claim
[1:33:00] to the anointing.
[1:33:04] Are you ready?
[1:33:06] And they are anointed
[1:33:09] &gt;&gt; with the genuine Holy Spirit,
[1:33:12] &gt;&gt; but that does not save an individual.
[1:33:16] &gt;&gt; There are some that are anointed.
[1:33:20] Samuel,
[1:33:22] had Samuel poured the oil on the first
[1:33:25] son
[1:33:27] and the second and the third, what would
[1:33:30] have happened? Nothing.
[1:33:33] because it wasn't theirs.
[1:33:35] &gt;&gt; It wasn't for them. It wouldn't have
[1:33:37] done anything. The spirit would not have
[1:33:40] come onto them from that day forward.
[1:33:45] Because it it would have been an
[1:33:46] exercise in futility.
[1:33:49] And so in this day, then it's poured
[1:33:52] out.
[1:33:54] The spirit of the Lord, Jesus said, is
[1:33:56] upon me because he hath anointed me to
[1:33:59] preach. And so he preached, did he not?
[1:34:03] &gt;&gt; Did he preach?
[1:34:05] &gt;&gt; Did he proclaim?
[1:34:08] &gt;&gt; And they all were recipients of that
[1:34:10] outpouring.
[1:34:13] &gt;&gt; But were they saved?
[1:34:19] &gt;&gt; They were some of the same ones that
[1:34:20] said, "Crucify, crucify."
[1:34:28] Some of the same ones.
[1:34:30] &gt;&gt; Some of the same ones that were out to
[1:34:32] destroy his influence. And then
[1:34:34] Caiaphas, Caiaphas, he's actually
[1:34:38] prophesied out of the scripture, things
[1:34:40] that were in the scripture. There must
[1:34:42] be one that must die for the people. And
[1:34:45] he he prophesied a true prophecy, but
[1:34:48] himself was false.
[1:34:56] That is why if you can catch it
[1:34:59] of the s services in the last couple
[1:35:01] weeks where God even told brother
[1:35:04] Brandham,
[1:35:05] keep it quiet, keep it still. Don't show
[1:35:09] it to all the people because it'll only
[1:35:12] cause impersonations.
[1:35:14] &gt;&gt; And I'll teach you how to fish. I'm
[1:35:16] going to come to that in a moment. And
[1:35:19] he's tried to explain the gift. try to
[1:35:21] explain how it worked. This is a sign in
[1:35:22] my hand. This is why. And I gave the
[1:35:25] example of a people I know that stood on
[1:35:28] the platform and he showed the sign in
[1:35:30] his hand.
[1:35:33] I was with him in a restaurant.
[1:35:38] And in fact is uh elder in our church
[1:35:43] who is sister Cindy Bergen calls him
[1:35:47] Grandpa Haney. and I'm going to be with
[1:35:50] his son tomorrow who was a deacon in our
[1:35:52] church up there. And there was just the
[1:35:54] three of us as I remember and brother
[1:35:57] Haney getting up in years,
[1:36:00] great saint of God. How we love him.
[1:36:03] And I introduced brother Bram. I said,
[1:36:05] "This is brother Haney."
[1:36:07] And he just reached across took his
[1:36:10] hand. And and this is exactly what
[1:36:12] happened. He he took his hand and he
[1:36:14] jerked and he looked at me like that. He
[1:36:16] said, "Did you get that?
[1:36:19] wasn't my hand. It was his hand.
[1:36:23] That that gift, that sign.
[1:36:26] And he got what his trouble was. Never
[1:36:29] said another word. Never said another
[1:36:32] word. But he wanted to know how I got
[1:36:33] it.
[1:36:38] Sorry, Brother Brandham. You're talking
[1:36:41] to the wrong man. I just don't have
[1:36:44] that.
[1:36:47] But you hear it on tape and and he and
[1:36:50] he's got a person up there and I believe
[1:36:52] it's a woman again and he and his and
[1:36:55] his hand shows the sign.
[1:36:58] There was a the remarks and so on and he
[1:37:01] called it vibrations
[1:37:03] and he told her exactly what it was and
[1:37:05] he just said
[1:37:07] I'm asking everyone else he said to
[1:37:09] close their eyes and bow their head but
[1:37:12] I want you to stay watching my hand
[1:37:15] and I'm going to pray.
[1:37:18] He says and if my hand becomes normal
[1:37:22] the child is healed. If it does not, God
[1:37:26] has chosen not to heal the child. Wasn't
[1:37:29] that simple?
[1:37:31] Isn't that profound?
[1:37:33] Does a man have thousands of people in
[1:37:35] front of him and puts himself on that
[1:37:37] kind of a position? Do you know why? He
[1:37:39] had absolute confidence in the one who
[1:37:42] had sent him. He knew he was
[1:37:43] representative of God Almighty. And so
[1:37:46] he just prayed and right in front of the
[1:37:48] eyes of that individual hand just become
[1:37:51] normal. He said, "There he is. There you
[1:37:53] are. Just normal.
[1:37:57] You've had your request. The child is
[1:38:00] healed.
[1:38:01] Is that marvelous how simple it is? You
[1:38:04] say, "Why am I going back and making
[1:38:06] that so simple?" Because that was a
[1:38:08] sign. But yet the people
[1:38:12] that it wasn't the sign that did it. It
[1:38:15] wasn't even the anointing that did it.
[1:38:17] It's the anointing to the right
[1:38:19] individual. And that does something
[1:38:21] special. I'm speaking to you today
[1:38:24] because listen to me. You may not be
[1:38:28] where you ought to be.
[1:38:30] You may know that in your heart of
[1:38:32] hearts, but deep down at the very
[1:38:35] bottom,
[1:38:37] you may know there's something there
[1:38:39] that is anchored. You say, "I know that
[1:38:43] I've been called to this message.
[1:38:46] I'm not perhaps living it the way I
[1:38:48] should, but I know I've been called.
[1:38:52] I know that I am a son of God.
[1:38:57] I know I'm a daughter of God.
[1:39:00] Then this service is for you.
[1:39:05] This service is to allow you to know, to
[1:39:11] allow you to be impressed.
[1:39:14] And I felt before I came to the service,
[1:39:16] this is the direction it was going to
[1:39:17] go. And I even have a song that was
[1:39:21] directed to have for the last song that
[1:39:23] we're going to sing, whiter than the
[1:39:25] snow.
[1:39:27] You may well know, and I'm way ahead of
[1:39:30] myself in the message,
[1:39:33] that there's something missing that
[1:39:36] there are some spots.
[1:39:38] You're just living too close to the
[1:39:40] world. You're living too distant from
[1:39:43] this message. You're living too distant
[1:39:45] from the Lord. This service is for you
[1:39:48] today.
[1:39:50] And I want to before I close, I'm going
[1:39:52] to take a few more minutes.
[1:39:55] I want to impose upon your mind and
[1:39:58] indelibly mark you
[1:40:02] that God,
[1:40:04] a sovereign
[1:40:06] act of God on this generation.
[1:40:09] and he sends as it were a little servant
[1:40:14] thrusts him out. He held him in the
[1:40:16] right hand. There were seven messengers
[1:40:19] in the right hand. Think of it, seven.
[1:40:22] And at the appointed time, God sent out
[1:40:25] the first one. Jesus had just departed,
[1:40:28] had just ascended, and soon he had seven
[1:40:32] in his hand, but he sent the first one
[1:40:34] out. And the apostle Paul and that's why
[1:40:37] there was an Apostle Paul it was he was
[1:40:40] driven and he had to go here and go
[1:40:43] there and make his journeys and
[1:40:45] establish this gospel that God had given
[1:40:48] and by divine revelation. He'd been
[1:40:51] taken into the third heaven. He could
[1:40:52] talk about the rapture being caught
[1:40:54] away. He could span the dimensions and
[1:40:56] lay down the whole the whole doctrine
[1:41:00] and write the Corinthians and the
[1:41:02] Thessalonians and the Colossians and the
[1:41:04] Ephesians and the Galatians and to write
[1:41:07] to Timothy and to Titus and to give them
[1:41:09] the instruction and he lay out almost
[1:41:11] the entire doctrine of the New
[1:41:13] Testament.
[1:41:14] And then the second one and the third
[1:41:16] one and the fourth one and down they
[1:41:18] came. And finally a Martin Luther and a
[1:41:22] Wesley.
[1:41:24] And now we have he only has one left in
[1:41:26] his hand. Only one.
[1:41:30] He's going to send them with a horn of
[1:41:32] oil.
[1:41:34] Anoint. You must anoint a people. Now
[1:41:37] you're not anointing the sons of Levi
[1:41:40] and you're not anointing Aaron the
[1:41:42] priest. You're not anointing an altar
[1:41:44] and you're not anointing something in
[1:41:46] the Holy of Holies. I've got a I I'm
[1:41:50] calling out a people and I'm going to
[1:41:53] send you with a sign that's indisputable
[1:41:55] and if they don't hear the voice of the
[1:41:57] first sign, I'll cause them to hear the
[1:41:59] voice of the second because I'll make
[1:42:01] them to even know the secret. I'll make
[1:42:03] you to know the secret of their heart.
[1:42:05] He didn't have to tell him that's the
[1:42:07] sign of the Messiah because that angel
[1:42:09] of the Lord that would be with him was
[1:42:11] telling him and instructing him. And
[1:42:13] here he came. He said he even told me
[1:42:14] the scriptures. Imagine having an angel
[1:42:17] of the Lord that God himself in a form
[1:42:19] telling a a servant what scriptures.
[1:42:22] Point them to Nathaniel. Point them to
[1:42:24] the woman at the well and let him know
[1:42:27] that's the sign of the Messiah. Tell
[1:42:29] those people it's a sign of the Messiah.
[1:42:31] Tell them it's a sign of the
[1:42:33] resurrection. Tell them this time has
[1:42:34] come. There's a certain people in the
[1:42:37] land. There's a certain people in the
[1:42:39] world and they're all over. They're in
[1:42:41] these churches. They're in the
[1:42:43] denomination. They're in these man-made
[1:42:44] cages. They're in their prisons. They're
[1:42:47] in their tombs as it were. take this
[1:42:49] voice to them
[1:42:52] &gt;&gt; and cry it out and take the horn that I
[1:42:55] have filled of the oil of the Holy
[1:42:58] Spirit for this generation and pour it
[1:43:01] out on this age.
[1:43:05] You do that. And the same one who sent
[1:43:09] the spirit of the Lord upon David from
[1:43:11] that day forward, he said, "You pour it
[1:43:13] on them and I'll put it into them."
[1:43:16] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. until the Apostle John could
[1:43:19] say, "You have an uncction." And I can
[1:43:21] say to you today, you have an uncction.
[1:43:24] You have an uncction from the Holy One.
[1:43:29] &gt;&gt; You received an uncction from the Holy
[1:43:31] One to understand what you understand,
[1:43:34] to see what you have seen.
[1:43:37] &gt;&gt; And it is a sign of the resurrection.
[1:43:41] You have had poured out onto you and
[1:43:43] into you the anointing
[1:43:46] &gt;&gt; for the rapture.
[1:43:54] &gt;&gt; Perhaps it'll be good for you to just
[1:43:56] hear this.
[1:43:58] In this church age, the message is being
[1:44:02] poured
[1:44:03] into the church.
[1:44:05] Speaks of this tabernacle. He was at his
[1:44:08] own tabernacle.
[1:44:09] He said this tabernacle is not a Holy
[1:44:12] Ghost tabernacle.
[1:44:14] There is no such a thing. I can say this
[1:44:17] building is not a Holy Ghost building.
[1:44:19] It's you that are sitting here that are
[1:44:21] Holy Ghost tabernacles who the message
[1:44:24] has been poured into.
[1:44:26] &gt;&gt; Do you accept it? You believe it with
[1:44:29] everything that's in you.
[1:44:34] individuals that come into this church
[1:44:37] are the Holy Ghost tabernacles.
[1:44:40] &gt;&gt; I want you to be able to identify
[1:44:42] yourself.
[1:44:43] &gt;&gt; I don't want you just to sit here and
[1:44:45] listen to a preacher. I want you to take
[1:44:47] those words and say, "I am that
[1:44:49] tabernacle.
[1:44:52] &gt;&gt; The altar of my heart has been anointed
[1:44:55] &gt;&gt; by the anointing of the Almighty, the
[1:44:58] Holy One of Israel has anointed me." and
[1:45:01] chosen that I should hear this message
[1:45:06] &gt;&gt; and come under the horn
[1:45:08] &gt;&gt; of the oil of the message of the hour
[1:45:17] said they are tabernacles these
[1:45:19] individuals they are tabernacles that
[1:45:21] contain the Holy Ghost but not the
[1:45:24] church in the body of a group. He says,
[1:45:28] "But what this man who was pouring the
[1:45:31] water," brother Brandon was referring to
[1:45:33] a dream that a person had, and he
[1:45:35] interpreted the dream and spoke of that
[1:45:37] dream in blasphemous names. And he says,
[1:45:40] "But what this man who was pouring the
[1:45:43] water, the messenger to the church,
[1:45:46] pouring the message
[1:45:48] &gt;&gt; into the church."
[1:45:52] Friends,
[1:45:54] &gt;&gt; you can consider myself way offbeat if
[1:45:57] you wish, but I believe it would do you
[1:46:00] good to say, "God
[1:46:04] has sent
[1:46:06] the greatest voice
[1:46:09] with the greatest sign
[1:46:11] &gt;&gt; that has ever been
[1:46:14] &gt;&gt; to me
[1:46:15] &gt;&gt; to pour into me."
[1:46:19] &gt;&gt; What devil?
[1:46:21] What devil can stand withstand that?
[1:46:25] &gt;&gt; What temptation can overcome that? When
[1:46:28] you know and you can confess that God
[1:46:31] has sent this kind of a voice to my
[1:46:35] address, to my home, to my place and
[1:46:40] poured the oil of the rapture into me.
[1:46:45] &gt;&gt; I've been anointed for rapture.
[1:46:48] &gt;&gt; Not just anointed for healing. You get
[1:46:50] healed and you die.
[1:46:52] &gt;&gt; Not just anointed for a better job or to
[1:46:54] sing a song. I've been anointed for the
[1:46:57] rapture.
[1:46:58] I've been anointed to defy death.
[1:47:03] &gt;&gt; I've been anointed to destroy death.
[1:47:10] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:47:14] &gt;&gt; It's not David who thought it up to be
[1:47:16] anointed. It's not the apostles who
[1:47:19] thought it up.
[1:47:20] &gt;&gt; It wasn't Nathaniel who thought it up.
[1:47:22] It wasn't the woman at the well who
[1:47:24] thought it up. It was God who sent it.
[1:47:28] &gt;&gt; God has sent this anointing. This
[1:47:30] uncction that you have.
[1:47:35] [Music]
[1:47:37] &gt;&gt; This anointing
[1:47:39] that you have received is not just for
[1:47:42] blessings of life. This anointing that
[1:47:45] this generation has received is to be
[1:47:48] the changed in the body.
[1:47:58] &gt;&gt; Didn't he say
[1:48:00] all that was in God,
[1:48:03] where did it go?
[1:48:05] &gt;&gt; Say it.
[1:48:07] &gt;&gt; He poured into Christ.
[1:48:10] &gt;&gt; You believe that?
[1:48:13] without any diluted. You don't dilute
[1:48:16] that.
[1:48:17] &gt;&gt; All that was in God,
[1:48:18] &gt;&gt; he poured into Christ.
[1:48:20] &gt;&gt; And all that was in Christ.
[1:48:24] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. He poured into the church,
[1:48:27] poured into the bride.
[1:48:29] &gt;&gt; All that was in God.
[1:48:32] &gt;&gt; And whatever was in the heart of Christ
[1:48:35] has been poured into the church. And I
[1:48:37] can tell you that the heartbeat of
[1:48:39] Christ oh is for to be united and to
[1:48:42] take this bride that he has been united
[1:48:44] to. Take her beyond this dimension of
[1:48:47] this veil of this flesh, the veil of
[1:48:49] this weak flesh and take her into his
[1:48:52] realm. Come to my home. Come to my
[1:48:55] house. Come to my place. There be no
[1:48:58] more sin. There'll be no more
[1:49:00] temptation. There'll be no more
[1:49:02] weakness. There'll be no more frailty.
[1:49:05] Hallelujah.
[1:49:06] Do you like it? Do you desire that
[1:49:09] there'll be no more?
[1:49:11] &gt;&gt; That's his promise.
[1:49:13] &gt;&gt; There'll be no more.
[1:49:15] &gt;&gt; What you experienced yesterday will
[1:49:17] never be again.
[1:49:19] &gt;&gt; There'll be no more.
[1:49:24] &gt;&gt; I can't imagine anybody wants to stay
[1:49:26] here.
[1:49:27] &gt;&gt; Can't imagine anybody who wants to stay
[1:49:28] in this world. Can't imagine anybody who
[1:49:30] wouldn't want to stand up and rejoice
[1:49:32] and say, "Oh, Brother Ed, you're
[1:49:34] speaking my language. You're speaking my
[1:49:37] heart.
[1:49:39] &gt;&gt; That's my language.
[1:49:43] &gt;&gt; Glory to God.
[1:49:45] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:49:49] &gt;&gt; Let's give him a thank offering.
[1:49:52] We give you praise, oh God.
[1:49:56] We give you praise, oh God.
[1:49:59] We give you praise, oh God. Hallelujah.
[1:50:02] We give you praise, oh God.
[1:50:13] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:50:15] Hallelujah.
[1:50:17] Hallelujah.
[1:50:19] [Applause]
[1:50:27] [Music]
[1:50:33] Praise God. Praise God.
[1:50:37] Praise God. Praise God.
[1:50:42] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:50:44] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:50:51] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:50:53] Glory,
[1:50:56] [Music]
[1:50:57] &gt;&gt; how marvelous,
[1:50:59] [Music]
[1:51:01] &gt;&gt; oh blessed,
[1:51:04] blessed lamb of God.
[1:51:17] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:51:23] They wonderful.
[1:51:52] That's the calling.
[1:51:54] &gt;&gt; Oh, that's the calling.
[1:51:57] &gt;&gt; Drink it in.
[1:51:59] &gt;&gt; The anointing that you have received.
[1:52:03] &gt;&gt; The anointing that you have received.
[1:52:06] This uncction is from the Holy One.
[1:52:09] &gt;&gt; Do not come from a man.
[1:52:15] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:52:32] Hallelujah.
[1:52:35] &gt;&gt; I'd like to leave you with just a little
[1:52:38] further thought before we
[1:52:41] and I want to I don't want to step out
[1:52:43] of this presence. You
[1:52:46] Stay with it.
[1:52:53] And if you're here,
[1:52:56] I'm saying very very serious thing. Now,
[1:52:58] if you're here and unmoved,
[1:53:03] unmoved by this anointing, probably is
[1:53:06] not for you.
[1:53:08] May not be for you.
[1:53:12] You say that's very s serious. Listen,
[1:53:16] it's going to be even more serious when
[1:53:17] the final finality of it all happens.
[1:53:22] There is going to be some go
[1:53:25] and there is some left behind.
[1:53:29] And when even the sheep and the goats
[1:53:30] are divided in the in the resurrection,
[1:53:34] there is some that will go to the right
[1:53:37] and some that will go to the left.
[1:53:41] I will say to this congregation, even if
[1:53:43] you feel as a servant of Christ,
[1:53:46] I speak. Even if you have the least
[1:53:49] tingle in your heart,
[1:53:52] I would respond to it. It's not to me,
[1:53:56] not to this service, not to this sermon,
[1:53:59] but I'd respond to it to the God that
[1:54:02] sent the representative with the horn of
[1:54:05] the message and poured it out in this
[1:54:07] age. And if we didn't have that message,
[1:54:09] I wouldn't really have anything to
[1:54:10] preach. I'd have some little little
[1:54:14] things and I can assure you I wouldn't
[1:54:16] be speaking. I would not be preaching. I
[1:54:18] would have given up the ministry many
[1:54:20] many years ago.
[1:54:23] We're not here for our enjoyment.
[1:54:26] We're not here because this is an easy
[1:54:28] job.
[1:54:29] We're here out of a burden
[1:54:32] for the people.
[1:54:35] Now I want to just take you one step
[1:54:37] further. Do we have a few moments?
[1:54:40] &gt;&gt; Just one step further and then I want to
[1:54:43] conclude because I said it was anointed
[1:54:45] for rapture.
[1:54:47] The Bible says because Enoch is our
[1:54:51] type.
[1:54:53] The Bible says by faith
[1:54:56] Enoch was translated
[1:54:59] that he should not see death
[1:55:02] and he was not found because God had
[1:55:05] translated him.
[1:55:07] For before his translation
[1:55:10] he had this testimony that he pleased
[1:55:12] God.
[1:55:14] And the word that is used there is a
[1:55:16] very very common word in a world of
[1:55:20] education.
[1:55:23] And it has a variety of applications.
[1:55:27] It refers to linguistics and the
[1:55:29] language and the way language and
[1:55:32] sentences are structured. It's called
[1:55:34] metathesis.
[1:55:37] Before he was metathesis,
[1:55:40] before he was translated, he had this
[1:55:43] testimony.
[1:55:45] Brother Brandham and I will come to it
[1:55:46] in a few moments. He speaks of where we
[1:55:50] are spiritually
[1:55:53] with where the world of science has gone
[1:55:56] in technology.
[1:55:59] And that science has gone and moved
[1:56:01] through all of the scientific
[1:56:03] achievement until they came to an
[1:56:05] astronaut age.
[1:56:07] And it came to an astronaut age because
[1:56:10] we were arriving at that time.
[1:56:14] The world has arrived. The world has has
[1:56:17] done various things to achieve
[1:56:20] sufficient technology, sufficient power,
[1:56:24] something that was absolutely
[1:56:26] unthinkable just a few years before. Now
[1:56:29] they're sending man beyond the grip and
[1:56:32] the hold of gravity and sending him in a
[1:56:35] pressurized container so he can go
[1:56:39] beyond the grip of the Earth. And he
[1:56:41] says, "We've had astronauts."
[1:56:45] And he refers to Enoch,
[1:56:48] which Enoch is the bride's type. He
[1:56:51] said, he said he even went up slow
[1:56:53] motion because he just started walking
[1:56:56] with God, which is what I'm speaking to
[1:56:59] a group of people today. And you're
[1:57:01] already on your way up.
[1:57:04] &gt;&gt; I announce to you, you're already on
[1:57:06] your way up. Enoch walked with God. And
[1:57:09] it may seem to you like it's slow
[1:57:11] motion, but the conclusion, the blastoff
[1:57:14] takes place.
[1:57:16] You won't have to have any physical
[1:57:18] reaction to it at all. You'll just be
[1:57:20] changed. And this what I want to speak
[1:57:22] about.
[1:57:25] &gt;&gt; And he was translated. He was
[1:57:26] metathesis.
[1:57:28] and metathesis in the chemical reaction
[1:57:32] in that realm. We won't deal with it in
[1:57:35] linguistics or language in the in the
[1:57:38] form of language or words but I want to
[1:57:41] speak of it just as it is out of the uh
[1:57:45] in in connection with the chemical
[1:57:47] reaction. A metathesis is a process in
[1:57:52] which one or more substances
[1:57:54] are changed into others.
[1:58:00] &gt;&gt; Enoch was met theis.
[1:58:04] &gt;&gt; He was walking in one substance and he
[1:58:08] was changed into another substance
[1:58:11] &gt;&gt; because he walked with God by faith.
[1:58:15] &gt;&gt; And God sends a messenger. Listen to me.
[1:58:18] Good. If I ever preached again, I want
[1:58:20] to preach this one out to the end. And
[1:58:22] God sent a messenger with a word with a
[1:58:26] word of metathesis for the people.
[1:58:29] You'll pour out this horn of oil and
[1:58:32] this horn has the power in it to change
[1:58:35] the substance.
[1:58:41] &gt;&gt; This is a metathesis message.
[1:58:48] Hang on to your seats.
[1:58:53] &gt;&gt; And metathesis also
[1:58:56] is it creates a chemical reaction in
[1:58:59] chemistry.
[1:59:02] a bi biol
[1:59:05] biular
[1:59:09] biomolecular I'm sorry biomolecular
[1:59:12] process involving the exchange of bonds
[1:59:17] between the two reacting chemical
[1:59:20] species.
[1:59:21] We're going to change our bond by this
[1:59:25] by this meth metathesis that's taking
[1:59:28] place. We've been born in sin, bound to
[1:59:32] a husband of this old nature. And now he
[1:59:36] has come with a message that divorced us
[1:59:39] from that and bonded us to Christ.
[1:59:45] &gt;&gt; It changed the bonding structure
[1:59:49] &gt;&gt; from this human existence
[1:59:52] and united us to Christ.
[1:59:55] [Music]
[1:59:57] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:59:59] This message was not a group of sermons.
[2:00:01] This isn't just 1,100. This is a message
[2:00:04] for the rapture.
[2:00:06] &gt;&gt; This horn of oil had the oil for the
[2:00:08] rapture poured out for the rapture. It
[2:00:12] has the power of metathesis in it. It'll
[2:00:14] change the chemistry.
[2:00:19] &gt;&gt; Look how scientific the prophet's
[2:00:21] message is. Where did he say you'll
[2:00:24] change?
[2:00:26] Where did he say you'll change in your
[2:00:28] atoms?
[2:00:30] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:00:32] &gt;&gt; In your atoms.
[2:00:34] &gt;&gt; You have received this anointing.
[2:00:39] &gt;&gt; That's what I was called to the pullpit
[2:00:40] today to say. You have received an
[2:00:43] uncction. You have received. You have
[2:00:46] it. Will you accept it?
[2:00:48] &gt;&gt; Do you believe it? You have received the
[2:00:52] anointing,
[2:00:55] the translation,
[2:00:57] the metathesis,
[2:00:59] the change of the bond.
[2:01:05] &gt;&gt; You shall leave.
[2:01:07] You shall leave and be separated from
[2:01:10] the bond of death.
[2:01:13] &gt;&gt; You're already resurrected
[2:01:16] &gt;&gt; in Christ.
[2:01:22] anointed
[2:01:24] &gt;&gt; for the rapture.
[2:01:29] &gt;&gt; He said, "You see, the progress of the
[2:01:30] church has followed the progress of time
[2:01:37] and we've changed now from airplane to
[2:01:39] astronaut."
[2:01:41] And there's got to be a change.
[2:01:44] &gt;&gt; There's got to be a metathesis.
[2:01:47] There has to be a release of one bond
[2:01:51] &gt;&gt; in the chemistry that God gave and unite
[2:01:54] us
[2:01:55] &gt;&gt; inseparably
[2:01:57] &gt;&gt; to another one.
[2:01:59] &gt;&gt; Even Christ our husband,
[2:02:01] &gt;&gt; we're united with him.
[2:02:06] &gt;&gt; And he says, "And we've seen three
[2:02:07] changes come in the progress of
[2:02:09] transportation of power."
[2:02:12] It always takes an added power, an added
[2:02:14] power, and an added power. keep more and
[2:02:17] more and more. Says, "Why didn't the
[2:02:20] airplane get up there?"
[2:02:23] And that's when the church was there.
[2:02:25] Why didn't it get up there? Hasn't got
[2:02:28] the power to do it. The astronaut has
[2:02:31] the power.
[2:02:35] Elijah was an astronaut
[2:02:40] &gt;&gt; and he experienced a metathesis
[2:02:42] so that he could come back on Mount
[2:02:44] Transfiguration.
[2:02:46] and stand there in a body
[2:02:49] &gt;&gt; to represent those
[2:02:52] &gt;&gt; and Moses came down and he was in a
[2:02:55] body. Moses had died and came back.
[2:02:59] Elijah was translated and came back and
[2:03:02] Jesus stood there in a body and had a
[2:03:04] metathesis and was glorified. And the
[2:03:07] apostle Peter said, "And we beheld him.
[2:03:12] &gt;&gt; We saw him.
[2:03:15] We saw it happen.
[2:03:18] &gt;&gt; We beheld him.
[2:03:21] &gt;&gt; You think for a moment that this one who
[2:03:22] stood there in a glorified body would
[2:03:24] send a messenger out of his hand and
[2:03:26] say, "Here's the horn. Here's the horn
[2:03:28] of the message. Here's the horn. Pour
[2:03:30] out the revelation. Not just a bunch of
[2:03:33] sermons in a book. Not just a bunch of
[2:03:34] tapes or a bunch of discs. Pour out this
[2:03:37] anointed word into those people.
[2:03:44] until another little pastor could come
[2:03:46] up and say, "You have this uncction. You
[2:03:49] have this anointing."
[2:03:53] &gt;&gt; And I say to this congregation, young
[2:03:55] and old, give yourself to it.
[2:03:59] &gt;&gt; This is the anointing for the rapture.
[2:04:02] &gt;&gt; This isn't just some nice words. This is
[2:04:04] the anointing for the rapture.
[2:04:06] There's never been a message that's been
[2:04:08] sent to the earth for that purpose
[2:04:11] outside of this message.
[2:04:16] &gt;&gt; It has in it
[2:04:18] &gt;&gt; the content of it
[2:04:21] is the power of metathesis. It's the
[2:04:24] power of change.
[2:04:35] I have to just read this to you and then
[2:04:37] I'm done.
[2:05:01] Brother Brandham was asked a question.
[2:05:06] Will the bride be gathered in one place
[2:05:12] and will it be in the west? He says,
[2:05:13] "Nope.
[2:05:16] Don't have to be here. Don't have to be
[2:05:18] there." Yes, the bride will be gathered
[2:05:20] together in one place. That is true.
[2:05:24] but not until the resurrection.
[2:05:28] Quotes the scripture, we that are alive
[2:05:30] and remain unto the coming of the Lord
[2:05:32] shall not prevent or hinder those which
[2:05:35] are asleep universally. He says, for the
[2:05:38] trump of God shall sound and the dead
[2:05:40] and Christ shall shall rise and we shall
[2:05:43] be caught up together with them to meet
[2:05:45] the Lord in the air. says the
[2:05:47] resurrection will set in first.
[2:05:51] The resurrection of those that are
[2:05:52] asleep.
[2:05:55] There will be awakening time
[2:05:58] and those which are asleep in the dust.
[2:06:01] Now, not all those that are asleep in
[2:06:04] sin
[2:06:06] because they sleep right on.
[2:06:09] They don't wake for another thousand
[2:06:10] years.
[2:06:12] But those who are sleeping in the dust
[2:06:14] will be waken first.
[2:06:16] And these corruptible bodies will put on
[2:06:19] incorruption
[2:06:20] &gt;&gt; in the rapturing grace of our Lord.
[2:06:24] &gt;&gt; This I stop here to say this uncction
[2:06:28] you have.
[2:06:31] Either that or I am
[2:06:34] found to be false and to be a liar.
[2:06:38] And I I tremble at even the thought of
[2:06:41] that.
[2:06:43] And I think of those things while I
[2:06:45] study, while I prepare. We have such a
[2:06:49] solemn responsibility to speak truth to
[2:06:52] the people.
[2:06:54] And he says,
[2:06:58] "And these incorruptible
[2:07:00] bodies will put on incorruption
[2:07:03] in the rapturing grace of our Lord." I
[2:07:05] say this message came in an abundant
[2:07:08] grace to a very wicked and adulterous
[2:07:11] generation.
[2:07:13] who now has received the sign of the
[2:07:16] Messiah and has received the sign of the
[2:07:19] resurrection. And we've had the
[2:07:21] technology to keep it real, to keep it
[2:07:24] alive, to hear the voice. They didn't
[2:07:27] hear that centuries ago. You can hear
[2:07:29] the actual voice.
[2:07:33] &gt;&gt; You can hear the shout.
[2:07:35] &gt;&gt; You don't have to think what it's like.
[2:07:37] You can hear the shout.
[2:07:40] &gt;&gt; You can feel the impulse.
[2:07:42] You can catch the divine vibration of
[2:07:45] God
[2:07:46] &gt;&gt; sent to and when you listen you used to
[2:07:48] say others have never had this.
[2:07:52] &gt;&gt; Why oh God you give it to me because he
[2:07:56] came to your house came to your place
[2:08:00] &gt;&gt; to pour the oil because it was not for
[2:08:03] their day but it is for our day. Good
[2:08:06] people, godly people, holy people,
[2:08:08] martyrs and all the rest of it. But they
[2:08:10] had a different horn poured out upon
[2:08:12] them. They had a different message. Are
[2:08:14] you with me? But we've had a horn with
[2:08:17] rapturing grace. Rapturing grace
[2:08:20] &gt;&gt; poured out.
[2:08:21] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:08:22] &gt;&gt; Into the church.
[2:08:23] &gt;&gt; Rapturing grace.
[2:08:25] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:08:26] &gt;&gt; And you haven't even begin to experience
[2:08:29] all that is that rapturing grace because
[2:08:32] he goes on and this is the process,
[2:08:34] friends.
[2:08:36] And then we'll all get together.
[2:08:39] And when they begin to get together,
[2:08:43] then we which are alive and remain shall
[2:08:45] be changed. When they begin to get
[2:08:47] together, then we which are alive and
[2:08:49] remain shall be changed. These mortal
[2:08:52] bodies will not see death, but just of a
[2:08:56] sudden there will be like a sweep. Says
[2:09:00] another place will be changed in your
[2:09:02] atoms.
[2:09:04] There be a sweep.
[2:09:07] Go over us and you're changed.
[2:09:11] &gt;&gt; It's already been spoken.
[2:09:14] &gt;&gt; This is part that was in the horn.
[2:09:16] &gt;&gt; They didn't have this in other
[2:09:18] generations, but it was in our horn of
[2:09:21] oil. This already been poured on you
[2:09:24] children. Already been poured on you
[2:09:27] believers. Already been poured out. The
[2:09:30] power of metathesis, the power of the
[2:09:32] change, the power to loose you from one
[2:09:34] bond and to bind you to another is
[2:09:37] already here.
[2:09:40] &gt;&gt; And if you're still bound to the world,
[2:09:43] I say the power is here. Maybe you have
[2:09:46] ignored it. Maybe you haven't given
[2:09:48] yourself to it. You need to give
[2:09:50] yourself to it. You need to listen to
[2:09:52] this message. You need to hear it in the
[2:09:54] hear the word in the light of this
[2:09:56] message as though it's something that
[2:09:58] God has sent to you personally to your
[2:10:01] address to take you from this place to
[2:10:04] that place. And that's what should
[2:10:06] always be the undergirling, the
[2:10:07] underpinning thought in your mind. It's
[2:10:11] not how do I get through this day and
[2:10:13] how do I pay my bills and how do I get
[2:10:16] my car fixed. Oh friends.
[2:10:19] Oh friends, it's so far beyond that. So
[2:10:24] far beyond these little earthly things.
[2:10:26] I can tell you that once you rise into
[2:10:29] the heavenly places that God has
[2:10:31] naturally be all kinds of things come
[2:10:33] against us. There'll be hard times but
[2:10:35] in the good times we'll praise his name.
[2:10:38] And in the bad times we'll do the same
[2:10:41] and we'll just keep moving on. And then
[2:10:43] I just finished with this.
[2:10:46] You're turned back like Abraham was.
[2:10:48] See, Abraham was changed. He had the
[2:10:51] change. Enoch was changed. Jesus was
[2:10:54] changed. The seed had to fall. He said
[2:10:57] this man has spoke cruel things against
[2:11:00] him. He says he doesn't understand the
[2:11:02] seed has to has to die and rot.
[2:11:08] &gt;&gt; In order to go through a a metathesis,
[2:11:11] it has to go through and rot and come
[2:11:14] out something different.
[2:11:16] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:11:19] Glory.
[2:11:26] &gt;&gt; You're turned like Abraham was from an
[2:11:29] old man to a young man, from an old
[2:11:32] woman to a young woman. What's this
[2:11:35] sudden change? And after a while, after
[2:11:38] a while, you are traveling like a
[2:11:42] thought. And you can see those then who
[2:11:46] are already resurrected.
[2:11:51] &gt;&gt; That's the process
[2:11:53] &gt;&gt; where a sweep is going to come. It's
[2:11:55] going to be a thing we don't comprehend.
[2:11:58] We don't understand it. And we're going
[2:12:00] to we're a changed in our atoms. I mean
[2:12:04] Jesus was changed in his atoms. He stood
[2:12:06] there in a glorified state, walked up
[2:12:07] the mountain, changed back and went back
[2:12:09] down.
[2:12:11] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:12:12] Don't tell me that Peter wasn't changed
[2:12:14] in his atoms. What do you He was in a
[2:12:16] prison
[2:12:17] &gt;&gt; with bars and doors and and and and and
[2:12:20] he goes through. How did he go through?
[2:12:22] He changed.
[2:12:24] &gt;&gt; I don't know. This whole gospel is the
[2:12:26] gospel of transformation. Changed.
[2:12:30] &gt;&gt; And those that have gone, they're not
[2:12:31] far away. They're here.
[2:12:33] &gt;&gt; The great host of witnesses are here.
[2:12:36] &gt;&gt; The angels are here. Your theophony is
[2:12:39] here. It's not somewhere else. Is this
[2:12:42] the truth? Is this what he preached? Is
[2:12:44] this what you believe?
[2:12:46] &gt;&gt; Say, I receive it. I receive it in the
[2:12:49] name of Jesus Christ. I receive this
[2:12:51] anointing
[2:12:55] &gt;&gt; and I'm done
[2:12:57] &gt;&gt; to say this.
[2:12:59] When David had the oil
[2:13:02] &gt;&gt; poured on his head, you're anointed for
[2:13:04] the king. And the spirit of God came on
[2:13:06] him. Dory had to go, brother Roger. He
[2:13:09] had to go back to his studio.
[2:13:12] He had to go back. He had to go back to
[2:13:14] his shape.
[2:13:16] &gt;&gt; Brother V had to go back to his
[2:13:18] landscaping or whatever he was doing.
[2:13:21] &gt;&gt; Had to just go back to his house. Had to
[2:13:23] go back and clean out the barn. Had to
[2:13:26] go to what he does. Maybe when I go home
[2:13:29] tomorrow morning's garbage morning. My
[2:13:31] wife say, "Honey, take out the garbage."
[2:13:33] I'm anointed. You sure are. There's
[2:13:36] still garbage to take out. Hallelujah.
[2:13:39] We still do what we always do, but we're
[2:13:41] anointed for the rapture.
[2:13:44] Hallelujah.
[2:13:46] &gt;&gt; Glory to God.
[2:13:48] [Applause]
[2:13:53] Isn't he wonderful?
[2:13:55] &gt;&gt; Oh, I want to sing. Whiter than the
[2:13:58] snow. Whiter than the snow. And if
[2:14:01] you're here and still too connected and
[2:14:03] hung up with this present world, let it
[2:14:06] be separated from you now. Let a
[2:14:09] metathesis of the word of God come into
[2:14:12] you now and separate that bond
[2:14:16] &gt;&gt; now and forever.
[2:14:21] &gt;&gt; I am dead to the world.
[2:14:23] &gt;&gt; Your struggle with the world, young
[2:14:24] people, you can die to the world. And
[2:14:27] the world is not a part of you anymore.
[2:14:32] Not only young people.
[2:14:34] &gt;&gt; 638 I believe it is
[2:14:40] &gt;&gt; wetter than the snow. There's two of
[2:14:41] them. It's 658. I'm sorry. 658.
[2:14:46] Everybody feeling good?
[2:14:49] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:14:50] &gt;&gt; That's where Marilyn got her song from.
[2:14:52] That quote, "We'll travel like a
[2:14:54] thought."
[2:14:57] Maybe she could add a verse to that.
[2:14:59] We'll travel like a thought and then
[2:15:02] &gt;&gt; we'll meet those that are resurrected.
[2:15:04] &gt;&gt; H I just got to speed up a wee bit.
[2:15:08] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:15:10] &gt;&gt; Just got to go a little faster.
[2:15:12] &gt;&gt; Einstein almost had it.
[2:15:15] &gt;&gt; He said in his theory of relativity, if
[2:15:18] you get matter traveling at the speed of
[2:15:21] light, matter can pass through matter
[2:15:23] without disturbing the molecules of
[2:15:25] either or the atoms of either. Oh, what
[2:15:28] a glorious thing. You can pass through
[2:15:30] matter.
[2:15:33] &gt;&gt; Jesus in his resurrection in the
[2:15:35] prophecies. This message is the sign of
[2:15:38] the resurrection.
[2:15:40] &gt;&gt; It's the sign of a group of people
[2:15:42] that's going to pass through matter,
[2:15:45] passing through matter.
[2:15:47] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:15:55] our brother and sister Esther Hazel able
[2:15:59] to visit with them last Sunday and you
[2:16:02] gave me that DVD on the privileged
[2:16:04] planet and maybe some have seen it here.
[2:16:07] I'd not seen it. He said especially the
[2:16:10] special features. I'm glad you said that
[2:16:12] because
[2:16:14] I turned the special features in the
[2:16:17] privileged planet and you all were here
[2:16:19] when I showed the little pale blue dot.
[2:16:22] That's where that comes from that and
[2:16:25] the scientists that are on there have
[2:16:27] done that work and put that there. But
[2:16:29] in the special features
[2:16:32] it takes us on the earth says now we're
[2:16:35] going to start a journey. We're leaving
[2:16:37] here and we're traveling at the speed of
[2:16:39] light. Oh my, you're talking my language
[2:16:43] now.
[2:16:44] And we're just leaving here and they
[2:16:46] just start moving. We got to go through
[2:16:47] our galaxy first. And they start moving
[2:16:50] at the speed of light. Just
[2:16:52] passing this planet and passing that
[2:16:54] one. We've been three and a half minutes
[2:16:57] and we've gone so many billion miles and
[2:16:59] we've just passed Mars or we've passed
[2:17:03] and they keep going. is that we've been
[2:17:06] going for a thousand years, light years,
[2:17:09] and we're still in our galaxy. And then
[2:17:12] we start seeing other galaxies passing
[2:17:15] by. They're like stars, one one galaxy,
[2:17:18] another. And I think they finally take
[2:17:20] you till you've been traveling a billion
[2:17:22] plus, maybe 10 or 100 billion years, and
[2:17:27] you're still going
[2:17:29] &gt;&gt; that. Oh my goodness,
[2:17:32] I lost track of it now.
[2:17:36] How do you figure that one out? My
[2:17:38] father made it all.
[2:17:41] &gt;&gt; He fills it all.
[2:17:43] &gt;&gt; This great God,
[2:17:46] how he can fill all of that. And that
[2:17:48] even helped me here this morning in the
[2:17:50] message. I thought, how glorious, how do
[2:17:53] you what are we friends? And here we get
[2:17:56] down here tied up in our little world.
[2:17:59] Oh, I feel I feel so sad even about
[2:18:03] myself. You get all affected and
[2:18:05] afflicted by this little thing and that
[2:18:07] little thing and and then I then then I
[2:18:09] think of that great big I think about
[2:18:11] traveling
[2:18:15] just been a short time just a few
[2:18:18] minutes and here we are way out our God
[2:18:22] and that's what brother Bram says in the
[2:18:25] Christ the mystery of God revealed said
[2:18:27] he loved fatherhood
[2:18:30] he loved fatherhood and he had to make
[2:18:32] himself known
[2:18:33] as a son of man so we could understand
[2:18:36] him.
[2:18:38] You know what friends?
[2:18:41] I hope you see my heart. I am so
[2:18:44] thankful. I want to thank this father,
[2:18:47] our heavenly father,
[2:18:49] publicly today for not just leaving, not
[2:18:53] just leaving us with a written record
[2:18:57] of the son of man,
[2:19:02] Jesus Christ, 2,000 years ago. And we
[2:19:05] have to sit here and try. But what grace
[2:19:08] is this? They sent it across our
[2:19:12] generation
[2:19:13] &gt;&gt; so we get it as close to us as we are.
[2:19:18] And I I hope that we all are able to
[2:19:21] sweep across in the rapture.
[2:19:24] I don't know if I've ever said this, but
[2:19:25] I will say it. I don't like to say it
[2:19:29] because I want to go in the rapture. I'm
[2:19:32] counting on going in the rapture.
[2:19:34] But if God should call me away before
[2:19:38] that time,
[2:19:39] you're going to have to start having
[2:19:41] some new language in your in your
[2:19:43] vocabulary.
[2:19:45] You'll have to say, you know, I had a
[2:19:47] pastor that actually was with this
[2:19:49] prophet.
[2:19:51] I had a pastor that actually he told us
[2:19:55] about these things, but it'll be
[2:19:57] different then. You can say you have a
[2:20:00] pastor right now that's been there, saw
[2:20:02] that, felt that, was next to that angel
[2:20:06] of the Lord, sat as close as I am to
[2:20:09] these brothers while the visions were
[2:20:11] coming and have this messenger say those
[2:20:14] kind of things and speak truth. You want
[2:20:16] to take advantage of what I'm saying to
[2:20:19] you now say, "I take it. I receive it.
[2:20:23] It'll make a change in my life. I will
[2:20:25] change my I will change my activities.
[2:20:28] I'll change my priorities.
[2:20:30] I believe what has been sent to me. I
[2:20:32] believe what has been said. I have been
[2:20:35] anointed for the rapture, for the
[2:20:38] change, for the sweep, for the change of
[2:20:40] the atoms.
[2:20:42] And I am one.
[2:20:45] I am one
[2:20:48] that have been ordained
[2:20:50] to travel like a thought and to meet the
[2:20:52] resurrected of all the ages.
[2:20:56] And I don't know how many are here that
[2:20:58] can say that from their heart, but I
[2:21:02] felt that this is the message that God
[2:21:04] give me for you today.
[2:21:06] Let's stand, shall we? And before we
[2:21:09] sing,
[2:21:11] I'd like to pray with you.
[2:21:16] Lord, as we have
[2:21:19] come to this time of this service, have
[2:21:22] taken a little extra time, but I'm
[2:21:25] asking, Father, that you'll do something
[2:21:28] special.
[2:21:29] There are people that I'm burdened for.
[2:21:33] Some are present, some are not present.
[2:21:36] There's no walls that are going to
[2:21:39] hinder you or stop you. to send your
[2:21:41] spirit, I pray, into the rooms where
[2:21:43] individuals are, which I've prayed for
[2:21:45] already before I came to the pullpit,
[2:21:47] and we're praying now.
[2:21:49] There's uh certain ones that are on on
[2:21:51] the hearts of the people that are here,
[2:21:53] Lord. And we are determined. We're
[2:21:56] determined that they too must be in this
[2:21:58] rapture crowd, this host that is to be
[2:22:02] to be taken and caught up to meet the
[2:22:05] Lord in the air. Father, I have poured
[2:22:08] out, oh God, what you poured into my
[2:22:10] heart. And now send this upon these
[2:22:12] people, even in a greater reality, I
[2:22:16] pray. And for those, Lord, that
[2:22:19] something stands in their way. May they
[2:22:21] be washed even now as we sing this song.
[2:22:24] May they take it as a prayer. May they
[2:22:26] appropriate it. And may the Holy Spirit,
[2:22:31] you're not done, Lord, with this
[2:22:32] service. We may be counting on closing
[2:22:34] it fairly soon, but you're not done. And
[2:22:37] I pray that your presence will go with
[2:22:39] the people long after they have departed
[2:22:42] the sanctuary. In Jesus Christ's name, I
[2:22:45] commit it to you now, Lord. Amen.
[2:22:50] Blessed be the fountain of
[2:22:55] a world.
[2:23:00] Blessed be the dear son of God.
[2:23:05] Only by his stripes we are healed.
[2:23:11] Though I wondered far from his
[2:23:16] bringing to my heart pain and wambow
[2:23:24] [Applause]
[2:23:25] [Music]
[2:23:31] [Music]
[2:23:40] than the
[2:23:43] Wash me in the blood of the lamb
[2:23:48] and I shall be wer
[2:23:56] [Music]
[2:23:59] and his body or
[2:24:05] grievous words
[2:24:07] [Music]
[2:24:12] in vain.
[2:24:15] Oh, may I fans
[2:24:22] my sins here below.
[2:24:26] Wash me in the blood that he shed
[2:24:31] and I shall be
[2:24:34] snow.
[2:24:36] [Music]
[2:24:44] than the snow.
[2:24:47] Wash me in the blood of the lamb
[2:24:52] and I shall be wher
[2:24:57] [Music]
[2:24:59] I am from thee
[2:25:03] of my heart
[2:25:06] [Music]
[2:25:09] do my sins to me
[2:25:14] can wash them
[2:25:19] Jesus to the mountain of
[2:25:23] [Music]
[2:25:26] thy promise I hope
[2:25:31] by
[2:25:32] [Music]
[2:25:36] shall be
[2:25:43] than the snow.
[2:25:48] [Music]
[2:25:52] Wash me in the blood of the lamb
[2:25:57] and I shall be.
[2:26:00] [Music]
[2:26:01] As I sang this song to myself this
[2:26:04] morning and sang this third verse,
[2:26:08] I thought that it is certainly relevant
[2:26:12] to
[2:26:13] our lives. If you please put up the
[2:26:16] third verse.
[2:26:19] This world is so intent,
[2:26:23] so determined
[2:26:25] to cause us to wander,
[2:26:27] to be distracted.
[2:26:31] And I thought this writer was certainly
[2:26:33] had the mind of God. Often is my heart
[2:26:36] gone astray.
[2:26:38] Crimson do my sins, I'm glad to say,
[2:26:41] seem to me. Our errors, our mistakes,
[2:26:44] our sins, the things we do wrong, and
[2:26:47] none of us are immune to it. And that's
[2:26:50] what Satan would love to use as a tool
[2:26:53] to condemn. I deny him that right.
[2:26:58] for the next line. Jesus,
[2:27:02] to that fountain of thine,
[2:27:05] &gt;&gt; leaning on thy promise I go.
[2:27:09] &gt;&gt; Cleanse me by thy washing divine.
[2:27:13] And the conclusion, and I shall be
[2:27:15] whiter than snow.
[2:27:20] &gt;&gt; Lord spoke to my heart today, friends,
[2:27:24] people sitting right here. I didn't
[2:27:25] preach this message in vain.
[2:27:28] There's some that are right here now and
[2:27:31] you need to enter into the whole
[2:27:33] experience
[2:27:35] of this anointed verse.
[2:27:38] I will now go to the fountain.
[2:27:44] I will now be released.
[2:27:46] I will give myself to this oil of this
[2:27:50] horn of the message that's been poured
[2:27:54] out.
[2:28:02] How many here?
[2:28:06] You really believe and you have felt
[2:28:10] you have felt the effects of the oil
[2:28:12] being poured out on you of this message.
[2:28:15] How many you're not ashamed to raise
[2:28:16] your hand? Say, "I felt that effect."
[2:28:21] Those of you that couldn't raise your
[2:28:22] hand, I'm looking at you.
[2:28:25] You should
[2:28:27] you should be able to raise your hand.
[2:28:29] You should have enough in you to say
[2:28:31] it's been poured out on me. And if you
[2:28:34] can't, then I'm going to sing this song
[2:28:37] and I'm going to pray this prayer that
[2:28:39] you will be able to.
[2:28:42] Everybody put their hands down. How many
[2:28:44] were not able to raise their hand, but I
[2:28:45] want to.
[2:28:47] I want to be able to do it. Don't be
[2:28:50] ashamed. Raise your hand up.
[2:28:53] I would like to be able to.
[2:28:56] No one.
[2:28:59] Well, if you couldn't raise your hand
[2:29:01] and you don't raise your hand,
[2:29:04] I have great fear in my heart. How would
[2:29:07] you expect a rapture? I could ask the
[2:29:09] next thing. Do you want to go in the
[2:29:10] rapture?
[2:29:15] Only a fool would say, I I don't want to
[2:29:17] go in the rapture.
[2:29:21] What kind of a person would say I don't
[2:29:23] want to go to heaven?
[2:29:27] There are some I suppose.
[2:29:35] You may be taking up a good seat where a
[2:29:37] believer wants to sit.
[2:29:41] Say, "Brother Ed, you've never spoken
[2:29:42] like that, but we've come to that time."
[2:29:46] either mean business with God in the
[2:29:49] vision of this congregation, the vision
[2:29:51] of this message, or go find yourself a
[2:29:53] place, but you feel aligned to.
[2:29:56] &gt;&gt; This is not your place.
[2:29:59] And I say to this congregation, if you
[2:30:01] hear anything that's outside of the
[2:30:02] vision that God has given to us in this
[2:30:04] message, you refuse it and have no
[2:30:08] fellowship with it whatsoever.
[2:30:11] &gt;&gt; We're far too far along. It was far too
[2:30:13] serious at time.
[2:30:18] I'll say something else to you now that
[2:30:20] I'm on the subject. Somebody says to
[2:30:22] you, "Well, I know things that are
[2:30:24] wrong. There isn't one person in this
[2:30:26] congregation that I can't find something
[2:30:27] wrong with."
[2:30:29] &gt;&gt; And if you're honest, you can't find,
[2:30:31] you know, your own life. There's
[2:30:32] something wrong with your own life. So,
[2:30:34] what good is it? Have we been I
[2:30:36] authorize you? Have we been authorized
[2:30:38] by God to find something wrong with the
[2:30:40] people?
[2:30:40] &gt;&gt; No, that isn't it. You've been
[2:30:42] authorized of God to be a brother, to be
[2:30:44] a sister that knows how to pray.
[2:30:47] &gt;&gt; He said, "If you find something, if you
[2:30:49] find a a person in need, you pray for
[2:30:51] them."
[2:30:52] &gt;&gt; And if it still remains there, I said,
[2:30:53] "You ought to pray some more." Then God
[2:30:55] hasn't heard your prayer.
[2:30:57] &gt;&gt; You does this congregation believe that.
[2:30:59] &gt;&gt; We're trying to get a people ready. I'm
[2:31:01] expending my energy. I'm expending my
[2:31:04] life as an old man, expending my life
[2:31:07] that you'll go in the rapture. And I
[2:31:09] need to announce to you today, you've
[2:31:11] been anointed for it. You received an
[2:31:13] uncction from the Holy One of Israel to
[2:31:15] be in the rapture. And if you don't make
[2:31:17] it, don't blame me. Don't blame this
[2:31:20] preacher. I preached everything that I
[2:31:22] got in my heart. You've been anointed
[2:31:23] for this rapture.
[2:31:27] &gt;&gt; God sent a little messenger. what he
[2:31:29] went through, his toil and his labors.
[2:31:34] And I I bow my head in shame when I
[2:31:36] think how he traveled on old prop planes
[2:31:40] through thunderstorms of Africa and
[2:31:42] think that I fly on jets far above it. I
[2:31:45] think, oh God, I don't I'm not deserving
[2:31:47] of this message. I'm not deserving of
[2:31:49] this servant. I'm not deserving of the
[2:31:51] efforts. The same as I don't feel
[2:31:54] deserving of the martyrs of ages past.
[2:31:56] But that was their life. That was their
[2:31:59] day. That was their oil that was poured
[2:32:02] on them. We've been anointed
[2:32:04] &gt;&gt; by a message.
[2:32:08] &gt;&gt; You have received that uncction.
[2:32:10] &gt;&gt; You have received that. Walk like kings.
[2:32:14] &gt;&gt; Walk like the anointed ones.
[2:32:16] &gt;&gt; And a prophet of God. You believe him?
[2:32:19] &gt;&gt; Do you believe him? Do you believe what
[2:32:20] he said over you? Not that I'm trying to
[2:32:22] make you feel good. You believe what he
[2:32:24] said? You're Messiah.
[2:32:27] He's the anointed one, our Lord Jesus
[2:32:29] Christ. And you are anointed because of
[2:32:31] him.
[2:32:33] &gt;&gt; You're the anointed
[2:32:35] &gt;&gt; sent to this generation.
[2:32:41] &gt;&gt; And perhaps God's dealing with you. I
[2:32:44] just urge you to give yourself to him
[2:32:45] now. It's between you and him.
[2:32:49] Father, I have wondered from thee.
[2:32:55] often has my heart
[2:33:03] single
[2:33:07] [Music]
[2:33:19] on thy proise.
[2:33:23] Cleanse me by thy washing
[2:33:29] and I shall be wer than snow.
[2:33:33] [Music]
[2:33:42] than the snow.
[2:33:46] Wash me in the blood of the lamb
[2:33:51] and I shall
[2:33:55] &gt;&gt; wash me in the blood. Wash me in the
[2:33:58] blood of the lamb
[2:34:02] and I
[2:34:05] [Music]
[2:34:08] wash in the blood of the lamb.
[2:34:13] [Music]
[2:34:23] &gt;&gt; Come by here, my Lord.
[2:34:25] Come by here.
[2:34:28] [Music]
[2:34:39] Come here.
[2:34:42] My
[2:34:47] [Music]
[2:34:59] Come by
[2:35:03] [Music]
[2:35:09] my
[2:35:14] pray.
[2:35:22] [Music]
[2:35:26] Someone's great
[2:35:32] come
[2:35:33] [Music]
[2:35:58] With every head bowed, please and our
[2:36:01] eyes closed in reverence and respect to
[2:36:05] this one. No one moving around. Please
[2:36:07] don't leave the sanctuary.
[2:36:13] Perhaps you didn't have
[2:36:17] the conviction or the strength or the
[2:36:20] you wanted to be honest and you couldn't
[2:36:21] raise your hand.
[2:36:25] But deep in your heart of hearts,
[2:36:29] there is a cry for truth, for
[2:36:32] righteousness,
[2:36:34] for deliverance,
[2:36:36] for a walk with God.
[2:36:39] something that perhaps you had do not
[2:36:41] have right now and have not had for a
[2:36:43] long time.
[2:36:44] And others of you may say, I need to
[2:36:47] draw so much closer
[2:36:50] than I have been. I need to I really
[2:36:53] need to tighten up the res.
[2:36:57] I need to get the things arranged
[2:37:01] in a different order and get ready for
[2:37:04] this crossing over.
[2:37:07] I need to feed myself
[2:37:10] on this word that has been sent to
[2:37:13] strengthen myself in the inner man. And
[2:37:16] I need to cut and sever myself from
[2:37:20] certain relationships,
[2:37:22] certain friendships,
[2:37:25] and from the enemy that is haunting and
[2:37:28] tempting me. I turn from him
[2:37:32] and I deny him this right because I know
[2:37:37] I'm a child of God.
[2:37:39] If I have described you
[2:37:42] and you wish to raise your hand, I will
[2:37:45] pray with you and for you.
[2:37:49] Almighty, righteous, kind heavenly
[2:37:53] father,
[2:37:55] with mercy that is new every day.
[2:38:00] Oh longsuffering one,
[2:38:04] patient,
[2:38:05] patient you are.
[2:38:08] You see us, Lord, as we seek to make our
[2:38:11] way through life.
[2:38:14] Do you see how the howling of the enemy
[2:38:16] has come against some
[2:38:19] dear ones, precious ones, some of your
[2:38:23] children, oh God,
[2:38:25] and I'm giving now myself with all that
[2:38:28] is in my heart and soul to pray for
[2:38:30] them.
[2:38:32] I pray that there will be a release of
[2:38:35] the Holy Spirit upon them. And I pray
[2:38:38] there will be a release of the grip of
[2:38:40] the enemy upon their lives. For I
[2:38:43] address you, Satan, in the name of the
[2:38:46] Lord of Hosts, the Lord Jesus Christ.
[2:38:50] Take your hand off of God's property.
[2:38:54] You have no right. And the church of the
[2:38:57] living God calls for you to be defeated
[2:39:02] and to depart.
[2:39:04] Some may be in the visible audience,
[2:39:06] some may not be in the visible audience,
[2:39:07] but you know, oh God, you're not
[2:39:10] restricted to time or space. And so we
[2:39:12] pray for those that your sons and
[2:39:14] daughters are praying for. Bring them
[2:39:17] into a deliverance, oh God. Bring them,
[2:39:20] I pray, into the way of truth and into
[2:39:23] the way of life.
[2:39:26] Separate them from the bond of the enemy
[2:39:29] and the bondages of sin.
[2:39:32] &gt;&gt; Oh God, let a meththesis take place. Oh
[2:39:36] Lord, I pray and there'll be a change.
[2:39:40] And now, Father, thank you for this
[2:39:42] praying people. Thank you for their
[2:39:44] hunger and sincere desire for the many
[2:39:47] miles that they drive in the time they
[2:39:49] give to be here. And may this day be
[2:39:52] solely dedicated to you. I pray, Father,
[2:39:55] lives will be healed, bodies will be
[2:39:58] healed,
[2:39:59] &gt;&gt; homes will be healed, oh God, and may we
[2:40:03] dwell in the full inheritance that
[2:40:05] you've intended for us. I thank you for
[2:40:07] the prayers of your people, Lord. May
[2:40:09] they continue to pray more than they
[2:40:11] have in the past. May they pray for the
[2:40:13] ministry. We pray for the service
[2:40:14] tonight. Oh God, come and do the
[2:40:17] spontaneous and the unexpected amongst
[2:40:19] us. Lord, bless this people, I pray, and
[2:40:22] dismiss us with your grace in the name
[2:40:24] of Jesus Christ.
[2:40:27] Amen. Amen. And while we greet one
[2:40:31] another, I'd like you to sing the song
[2:40:34] in truth. Somebody's praying. me. No,
[2:40:37] brother Brandham had the people in the
[2:40:39] tape I just heard last night. He had the
[2:40:41] people actually lay hands on one
[2:40:43] another, just touch one another, say,
[2:40:45] "No, somebody's praying for them." But
[2:40:48] as you shake hands with the people
[2:40:49] today, as many as you can and say it
[2:40:52] sincerely and say it with meaning and
[2:40:54] when God brings them to your thought, to
[2:40:56] your mind, say prayer for them. I think
[2:41:00] the church would be much much
[2:41:03] strengthened if we prayed for one
[2:41:04] another without ceasing. We shake hands
[2:41:07] with one another now and God dismiss you
[2:41:09] in Jesus name. Someone's praying.
