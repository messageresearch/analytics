[17:49] their prayers, for all the love that was
[17:51] shown

[18:37] I bless you, brother Darren, if you'd

[18:45] Let's pray.
[18:52] Lord Jesus,
[18:55] Lord, I want to say thank you that it is
[18:57] well with my soul.
[19:00] Lord Jesus, that you came to each one of
[19:02] us one time at the appointed hour, that
[19:05] you revealed yourself to us. You took
[19:09] away the the veil of sin, dear Lord. You
[19:12] opened up our eyes, dear God, to behold
[19:15] your glory, to behold your beauty, Lord,
[19:18] not just to behold it, but to partake of
[19:20] it, Lord Jesus, that we could not only
[19:23] partake of it, Lord, we could live it
[19:25] every day. That we could live with you,
[19:27] Lord Jesus. we could walk in this
[19:29] blessed way that you prepared for us,
[19:31] Lord. Father, before the foundation of
[19:34] the world, you predestinated us, Father,
[19:36] to be members of the bride of Jesus
[19:39] Christ. You predestinated us, Father, to
[19:42] glorify you, to praise you, to fulfill
[19:45] your purpose, your plan for our lives,
[19:47] Lord, in this great plan of redemption,
[19:50] Lord Jesus. And Father, we just labor in
[19:52] it, Lord God. We just fight for that
[19:55] which is ours. Dear God, when the enemy
[19:57] comes in like a flood, you said you'd
[19:59] raise up a standard against it, Lord.
[20:01] And Father, that for our healing, Lord,
[20:03] we remember our sister Barb Drake, Lord.
[20:05] How the devil's battling her, dear God.
[20:07] But you said one would slay a thousand,
[20:09] two, 10,000, dear God. So we bind our
[20:12] hearts this morning Lord Jesus on behalf
[20:14] of birth sister Barb Lord and any others
[20:16] dear God who are not feeling well in her
[20:18] body Lord whether it's here on the phone
[20:21] hookup Lord the streaming father those
[20:24] that are in our hearts Lord God for the
[20:26] blood of Jesus Christ Lord Jesus paid it
[20:29] all Lord by your stripes who were
[20:30] already healed Lord it's the finished
[20:33] work of Calvary Lord I believe it was
[20:36] was Wednesday we heard it all it's
[20:37] finished father everything you've done
[20:39] for us dear God you've already done it
[20:41] Lord It just takes us to appropriate
[20:42] that faith. Lord, just to take a hold of
[20:45] those promises of God. Lord, we just
[20:47] pray that you'll just encourage our
[20:48] sister Barb. Lord, it's nothing but a a
[20:50] lying vanity, dear God, that's keeping
[20:52] her down, dear God. But his daughter of
[20:54] God will raise up, Lord. She'll take
[20:56] that word. She'll take it by faith, dear
[20:58] God, and walk in it, Lord. She'll put
[21:00] her foot upon the neck of that devil,
[21:02] dear God, that's trying to keep her
[21:04] down, and she'll be walking in victory,
[21:06] Lord. I'm believing even for today, Lord
[21:08] Jesus. And father, we're so thankful for
[21:11] these promises you've given us, Lord.
[21:13] Salvation for our loved ones, Lord.
[21:15] Father, so many promises, Lord, for
[21:18] financial needs, dear God. Those that
[21:20] have financial needs, Lord. You've given
[21:22] us comfort, Lord God, for the Daz
[21:24] family, Lord Jesus, at this time. We
[21:26] thank you, Lord, that all we have need
[21:28] of your hand has already provided it,
[21:29] Lord. And Father, we just thank you for
[21:32] this opportunity to be here this
[21:34] morning, Lord. Father, for how we just
[21:37] approach you now, dear God, that you
[21:38] would revelate us, Lord. Lord, as the
[21:41] man of God has waited upon you, we so
[21:44] thank you for our pastor, Lord. We thank
[21:46] you for the men of God that stand behind
[21:48] this pull pit. No, Lord Jesus, we don't
[21:50] come here to be seen by anybody, Lord,
[21:53] but Lord Jesus, that you would see us,
[21:55] Lord, not that we'd have any accolades
[21:57] or any applause by man, dear God, but we
[21:59] could look to you, Lord Jesus. We can
[22:01] see your smile of approval in our lives,
[22:03] dear God. Lord, that we could labor for
[22:06] the kingdom, Lord. So help us to labor
[22:07] this morning to pull upon the gift, Lord
[22:10] Jesus. We may not have a specific need
[22:12] that we can think of, Lord, but there's
[22:13] needs, Lord. As those hands were raised
[22:15] last service, there's needs all around
[22:17] us, Father. Let us pull upon the gift
[22:19] that the answer, Lord, so our prayers
[22:22] would be heard, would be received this
[22:24] morning. So anoint our faith this
[22:26] morning, Father. Anoint the speaker, the
[22:28] hearer like, dear God, as we pray this
[22:31] that you'll just drop in that revelation
[22:32] into our hearts this morning. as we wait
[22:35] upon you, Father, in the name of Jesus
[22:37] Christ, and we ask these mercies,
[22:39] Father. Amen.
[22:47] If that is un

[27:10] Amen.
[27:14] Thank you for singing my special.
[27:18] You sounded wonderful.
[27:22] Jesus said that's when they shall know
[27:26] that you're my disciples. When you have
[27:28] love one for the other. And I believe
[27:32] that's the only thing that we can truly
[27:34] express
[27:35] that God part within us is when we love
[27:38] one another. God bless you this morning.
[27:42] Want to turn the service right to our
[27:43] pastor. Give him as much time as he
[27:46] needs this morning. Want to remember our
[27:48] brother Thomas. He's ministering down in
[27:51] the Steamman church down in Sarasota,
[27:52] Florida this morning. Remember brother
[27:54] Ernie this afternoon as he'll be taking
[27:56] the service down in Seattle. Brother
[27:58] John took the service on Friday evening.
[28:01] He'll be ministering here this evening.
[28:02] I think the Lord has a wonderful day in
[28:05] store for us today. Amen. As our pastor
[28:09] comes,
[28:12] let's sing uh 10:41 if we could on the
[28:14] screen. All I want to see is Jesus
[28:19] living in me. The time is coming near.
[28:22] That's all we really want to have
[28:24] reflected in our lives. Not our own
[28:26] nature, not another nature that we pick
[28:30] up off of somebody else, but we truly
[28:32] want the life of God living within us.
[28:35] Amen. Let's sing this together this
[28:36] morning as we turn the service to
[28:38] brother Ed.
[28:42] Oh, I know the time is near where
[28:48] everything
[28:50] that I hold dear will lay before the
[28:55] holy
[28:58] consuming
[29:00] fire.
[29:03] All my words and all my deeds. And every
[29:09] praise on my knees will lay before the
[29:16] holy
[29:18] suming
[29:20] fire.
[29:23] All I want to see
[29:27] is Jesus.
[29:33] All I want to see
[29:38] is
[29:40] me.
[29:43] All I want to see
[29:47] is Jesus
[29:53] shine
[29:57] through me.
[30:02] hurt and selfinflicted
[30:05] pain and everything
[30:09] that I thought gave were lay before the
[30:14] holy
[30:16] cons
[30:22] of knowledge in his name and healing
[30:27] hands and touches
[30:30] We're late for the holy
[30:35] soothing
[30:37] fire.
[30:41] I want to see
[30:47] Jesus.
[30:50] I want to see. I want to see.
[30:59] All I want to see
[31:03] is Jesus.
[31:08] He sh
[31:13] through
[31:17] here.
[31:19] I want to hear
[31:34] Oh,
[31:45] I faithful.
[31:55] All I want to see
[31:58] is Jesus.
[32:04] All I want to see
[32:08] is
[32:13] All I want to see
[32:17] is Jesus
[32:24] shining
[32:26] through
[32:27] me.
[32:32] I want to hear him say,
[32:37] "Oh, well done.
[32:42] You're my precious, precious.
[33:08] Amen.
[33:10] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[33:11] &gt;&gt; All we want to see this morning is
[33:13] Jesus.
[33:14] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[33:15] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[33:20] I want to
[33:22] appreciate the atmosphere and we want to
[33:25] be remembering our brother Ivan has uh
[33:29] returned to China for a very quick trip
[33:33] and we'll be gone perhaps a couple of
[33:35] weeks and then
[33:39] you know what is happening the Bible
[33:41] says that there'll be a very short work
[33:45] and he'll cut it short It certainly
[33:48] seems that we're there. There is so so
[33:52] much that is taking place. We have a
[33:55] hard time staying a breast of it and
[33:57] we're happy that
[33:59] very very happy just to be a part of it.
[34:03] &gt;&gt; I don't know. I I delight to see God's
[34:06] work
[34:08] uh wherever it takes place, wherever he
[34:10] chooses it to take place. We're thankful
[34:13] for what he's done here.
[34:15] the testimonies. I've been just turning
[34:19] them over in my mind this last week and
[34:23] seeing what God has done in a
[34:25] supernatural. And we we should fully
[34:27] expect it, should we not?
[34:29] &gt;&gt; Do you agree with that?
[34:31] &gt;&gt; We should fully expect it.
[34:33] &gt;&gt; And uh so I just want you to remember
[34:36] brother Ivan in prayer. I will tell you
[34:39] I I probably wouldn't be able to
[34:42] describe exactly what is taking place,
[34:44] what is happening. There is uh there's
[34:46] something that is taking place and
[34:48] they're working on right now that is
[34:52] uh just so remarkable. You have to
[34:56] you'll have to turn your thoughts loose
[34:59] and one day soon we want to let you know
[35:03] what it is that is actually taking place
[35:06] there. uh the use of the use of
[35:08] technology and the use just the way God
[35:11] has ordained things uh and it's it is so
[35:16] so very remarkable.
[35:19] I will just give you this little clue.
[35:22] The King James version of the Bible as
[35:25] you have it and as prophet of God used
[35:28] it is uh not translated into Chinese. it
[35:32] is uh they have the NIV
[35:36] and uh the that version that they use
[35:39] and it's very very different from the
[35:42] from the scriptures as brother Brandham
[35:44] read them and so uh uh we hope to be
[35:49] able to let the people be able to have
[35:52] the King James version
[35:55] and uh and each time there's a question
[35:58] in their mind about what the scripture
[36:01] in that version means the technology
[36:04] that they have will direct them directly
[36:07] to brother Brandham's message. And I
[36:10] think that is remarkable.
[36:13] &gt;&gt; Absolutely remarkable. So I've just told
[36:15] you that much and and uh we we we're
[36:19] happy to be engaged in this kind of
[36:21] thing.
[36:22] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[36:24] &gt;&gt; Give the winds a mighty voice.
[36:28] &gt;&gt; Glory to God. We talk about a message,
[36:30] friends, but I'll tell you, it's a
[36:32] remarkable message. It's a glorious
[36:34] message.
[36:35] &gt;&gt; Amen. We're also
[36:39] uh happy to have uh our brother uh
[36:44] brother Caleb, who is brother Dio's
[36:47] younger brother and his brother Oed's
[36:50] uncle. And I wonder, brother Caleb, if
[36:53] you would stand, please. And brother,
[36:56] there's brother Caleb. I'd like you to
[36:58] greet him.
[37:04] God bless you.
[37:07] I have a great admiration for the way
[37:10] certain people approach various things.
[37:12] Our brother Caleb is from Paris
[37:15] and he flew from Paris, France
[37:18] to come here to ask some spiritual
[37:21] questions and to view the school.
[37:25] I tell you that's a long ways to come.
[37:28] Some may not feel uh it essential to go
[37:32] across the street, but here's a a man,
[37:36] whatever God has put in his heart, and
[37:39] he has some children, and he's concerned
[37:42] about those children and flew here to
[37:45] see the school and to ask some spiritual
[37:48] questions. And I say, "Brother Caleb, I
[37:51] was happy to sit down with you and and
[37:54] answer whatever I could." And thank you,
[37:57] brother Oed, for bringing your uncle
[37:59] down. Brother Oed came down from they
[38:01] drove down from Edmonton. And so we say,
[38:04] God bless you.
[38:06] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[38:08] Um,
[38:11] also our brother and sister,
[38:15] uh, Hank Iverson are here. I know that
[38:17] they've been greeted already. Uh,
[38:20] brother Nathaniel Iverson's mother and
[38:23] dad and uh, Sister Iverson's father was
[38:28] brother Vanise
[38:30] who was pastor in Gent, Belgium for over
[38:35] 40 years and we were there at their 40th
[38:38] anniversary meeting. He has gone on to
[38:41] be with the Lord now. So, uh, I don't
[38:45] know just how old he was, but he's about
[38:47] 18 or 20 about now. And, uh, we'll we'll
[38:52] be introduced to him someday soon.
[38:56] &gt;&gt; Uh, amen. Great. Join the great host of
[38:59] witnesses.
[39:01] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. You believe that?
[39:02] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[39:03] &gt;&gt; Of course we do. So, we're happy to have
[39:05] our brother and sister Iberson here. And
[39:09] uh uh they took the time to drive my
[39:12] wife and I to the Amsterdam airport when
[39:16] we were just over there recently and had
[39:18] the meetings in Germany, Belgium, and
[39:21] and in Holland. And so,
[39:25] um about a three-hour trip took about
[39:28] five or six hours because of the
[39:30] traffic. And I just want to say, Brother
[39:34] Iverson, we really appreciated it very
[39:37] much. God bless you. Amen. Well, um,
[39:43] would we like to turn to the word?
[39:46] &gt;&gt; I was asked by brother Roy Flor if we
[39:50] had if I was going to take another uh an
[39:54] one more series on uh, let this mind be
[39:58] in you. And he said, "Do you have do you
[40:00] have one more?" And I said about 2 and
[40:01] 3/4. So if you pray and and now you pray
[40:06] and and we'll we'll read the scripture
[40:08] and uh if you'll stand with me. Thank
[40:11] you musicians. God bless you.
[40:16] I want to uh have you turn once again
[40:20] to uh Philippians the 2 chapter. We're
[40:24] we're only going to read verses 5 to8.
[40:27] And then we will read also John out of
[40:31] John 12
[40:34] uh verses 27 and 28
[40:37] and John 17 and 1.
[40:42] Before we read, let us pray.
[40:47] Almighty God, we just have such a
[40:50] desire, a hunger in our heart to come
[40:54] into your presence and to have your Holy
[40:57] Spirit speak to us. We are people that
[41:02] have come from uh different paths. Uh we
[41:05] live in different places. We have
[41:08] different backgrounds and different
[41:10] upbringings, but we have been all
[41:13] birthed by the same spirit into the
[41:16] family of God. And we're so thankful for
[41:19] the family of God. So thankful for the
[41:22] teacher, the Holy Spirit that teaches
[41:24] us. So thankful for the message that you
[41:27] sent and a messenger that was
[41:30] uncompromising with the word and you
[41:32] laid it on the line. And oh God, we pray
[41:36] you'll keep us always to be true to your
[41:39] word. And may that hunger never eb or
[41:43] may we never become slack, oh God, in
[41:46] this great great race that we are
[41:49] running now. We pray you'll bless
[41:51] brother Ivan today, oh God. We pray
[41:54] you'll bless those that are with him.
[41:56] Pray father you bless our brother Jean
[41:58] Chimpaka. Oh God and the translator
[42:01] which he has just been in touch with.
[42:04] Lord God how we know that your your word
[42:07] must go to many peoples and you it is
[42:10] you that is seeking out every last one
[42:13] of your own sheep and you will bring
[42:15] them for there will be none lost. Oh God
[42:19] none will escape your hand. In the name
[42:22] of Jesus Christ, we pray you'll bless
[42:24] every effort by every member of the
[42:27] bride of Jesus Christ, every minister
[42:29] that ministers to the bride. Inspire
[42:32] them, oh God, and bless them. We lift
[42:35] them up in your name, oh God. And we
[42:38] thank you that we can be members of this
[42:39] great bride body of Jesus Christ. And
[42:42] now anoint us, Lord, for service to
[42:45] speak and also to hear in Jesus' name we
[42:48] pray. Amen.
[42:50] Hallelujah.
[42:52] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[42:54] &gt;&gt; We'll read a few verses out of
[42:56] Philippians the 2 chapter starting with
[42:58] verse 5. Once again, let this mind be in
[43:02] you which also
[43:05] uh which was also in Christ Jesus,
[43:09] who being in the form of God, thought it
[43:12] not robbery to be equal with God, but
[43:15] made himself of no reputation, and took
[43:17] upon him the form of a servant, and was
[43:21] made in the likeness of men. and being
[43:24] found in fashion as a man, he humbled
[43:27] himself and became obedient unto death,
[43:31] even the death of the cross. I'm
[43:34] stopping to read there and then we will
[43:36] read from John's gospel, the 12th
[43:39] chapter
[43:41] vers 27 and 28. I had told those on this
[43:45] streaming it would be verse 28, but I'd
[43:48] like to read verse 27 also.
[43:52] And before we read, if you can, uh, I'd
[43:55] like to place the scripture,
[43:58] if your Bible has notes, it will tell
[44:00] you that it is at the supper of Bethany.
[44:05] And that supper was just 6 days prior to
[44:08] the Passover
[44:10] at the time when Jesus would be going to
[44:12] be crucified.
[44:14] And then if you read in the 12th chapter
[44:18] then it will tell you uh that the next
[44:22] day after when you're reading here the
[44:25] supper Bethany was where Jesus was
[44:27] anointed and then the next day he had
[44:30] the triumphal entry into Jerusalem. We
[44:34] know now all events are racing very
[44:37] quickly, rapidly towards his crucifixion
[44:42] and death and resurrection.
[44:45] And so now then 6 days prior to the
[44:49] Passover and then the next day, which
[44:51] would have been 5 days prior, he has the
[44:54] trump triumphal entry.
[44:57] And so all of these things which he's
[44:59] speaking now to his disciples, many of
[45:02] them are only recorded in John's gospel.
[45:05] And of course, John was that eagle
[45:07] spirit. We know in the beginning, he
[45:11] starts in the beginning. He starts
[45:12] different from the other four gospels,
[45:14] the other three gospels. And so now we
[45:17] will go to verse uh 27.
[45:22] Now is my soul troubled, and what shall
[45:25] I say? Father, save me from this hour,
[45:30] but for this but for this cause came I
[45:35] unto this hour.
[45:37] Father, glorify thy name. And then came
[45:42] there a voice from heaven, saying, I
[45:44] have both glorified it and will glorify
[45:48] it again. in John 17 and 1. This was our
[45:55] Lord Jesus prayer. It's only recorded in
[45:58] John's gospel as well.
[46:02] These words spake Jesus and lifted up
[46:05] his eyes to heaven and said, "Father,
[46:09] the hour is come. Glorify thy son that
[46:14] thy son also may glorify thee."
[46:17] &gt;&gt; Amen. And all the glory is to our God.
[46:21] Amen. You may be seated.
[46:30] The cross stands
[46:33] as a monument.
[46:38] All Christianity I I see crosses of
[46:41] every kind. the crosses in front of
[46:43] churches, crosses in our cars,
[46:47] crosses hanging on the necks of all all
[46:51] kinds of people.
[46:53] And I don't know what it means to them,
[46:57] but to the congregation today,
[47:00] the cross stands as an emblem
[47:04] of a defeated enemy. Amen.
[47:08] &gt;&gt; The cross stands as an emblem of a
[47:11] mighty victory,
[47:13] &gt;&gt; a great battle that was won and a mighty
[47:17] victory. The cross stands for that. And
[47:21] God has always had the plan of
[47:23] redemption
[47:26] perceived in his mind. He always had the
[47:29] redemption in his mind. The Bible speaks
[47:32] of the of the lamb that was slain before
[47:35] the foundation of the world.
[47:38] So, you know, there is no time as such
[47:41] in eternity. But the lamb of God was
[47:45] slain. God knew there was going to be a
[47:48] fall. God knew he'd have an enemy. God
[47:52] knew because he's omnipresent and he's
[47:55] omnisient. He knows all things. God
[47:58] cannot learn anything. And this is hard
[48:01] for us to grasp. We cannot grasp it. We
[48:03] cannot. All we can do is accept it. God
[48:06] knew this great God, eternal God knew
[48:11] these things were going to happen. And
[48:12] he also knew that he was going to
[48:14] destroy this enemy. And I quite frankly
[48:17] myself just as a personal belief believe
[48:20] that this civilization and the creation
[48:23] of the earth and the creation of mankind
[48:27] all came about for the purpose of
[48:30] destroying his enemy.
[48:32] &gt;&gt; He's going to do away with sin.
[48:35] &gt;&gt; He's going to do away with sin. And I
[48:38] doubt really I doubt very very much that
[48:42] we as humans realize that we were we
[48:47] represent the the highest order of God's
[48:52] creation.
[48:54] &gt;&gt; He created the heavens and they're
[48:56] wonderful and glorious. Created the
[48:58] stars and the galaxies and the universes
[49:00] and whatever more and that's all
[49:03] wonderful. But when God was done and he
[49:06] had a man in his own image,
[49:09] a man in his own image, we have to
[49:12] recognize that that was the there was
[49:15] nothing beyond that.
[49:18] &gt;&gt; There was nothing beyond that. You know,
[49:20] they talk about al evolution, but there
[49:23] was nothing beyond nothing could evolve
[49:25] beyond man. Man was the highest order
[49:29] &gt;&gt; and we are in the image of God. And
[49:31] Satan would like you to believe
[49:33] something less about yourself.
[49:36] &gt;&gt; But whatever we are, we are by the grace
[49:39] of God.
[49:41] &gt;&gt; And uh in the in the message uh that he
[49:44] spoke on Job, he said God always had a
[49:48] plan of redemption. And that's been
[49:51] through blood ever since the very
[49:55] beginning of and dawn of time perceived
[49:58] in the mind of God before the world ever
[50:02] came into existence.
[50:05] Let this mind be in you. God before the
[50:10] dawn of time thought of redemption.
[50:14] &gt;&gt; He's going to redeem not only the
[50:16] creation, he's going to redeem this
[50:19] place. this earth where he uh he
[50:23] ordained it of all the
[50:26] planets. He ordained that he would have
[50:29] this one wi with an abundance of seed of
[50:32] every kind of every type of creatures uh
[50:36] multitudes of them extinct today. But
[50:39] God is going to cleanse it and renovate
[50:41] it and make it a worthy place for
[50:44] himself and his people.
[50:46] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[50:47] &gt;&gt; We believe that. Amen.
[50:50] &gt;&gt; So, he had redemption and the prophet
[50:52] said he had redemption in his mind. I'm
[50:55] preaching today because I'm desiring by
[50:58] the Holy Spirit to have that that
[51:01] thought that he had of redemption in
[51:05] your mind.
[51:07] &gt;&gt; Let let this mind be in you which was
[51:10] also in Christ Jesus. Uh that we should
[51:12] be consumed with redemption.
[51:15] And I want to if I by the grace of God
[51:19] just to index that and turn it around
[51:22] for a moment that you will see
[51:24] redemption as having been an incredible
[51:27] battle.
[51:29] &gt;&gt; And an incredible victory.
[51:33] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[51:34] &gt;&gt; Tell you what friends, when we look at
[51:36] the cross, that's where the crossroads
[51:39] of eternity or not eternity but
[51:42] humanity. That's the crossroads of all
[51:44] humanity. And there Jesus said he's
[51:48] coming to that hour and he's saying
[51:51] glorify thyself.
[51:54] I was thinking of uh you know we think
[51:56] of uh glory and the word glory and we
[52:00] have uh there's there's many words that
[52:04] in English does not describe fully what
[52:08] the full extent of the depth of the
[52:11] meaning of the word. not just so much
[52:13] the meaning of the word but other
[52:15] reflections of of the word. For example,
[52:18] when we think of glory and the and the
[52:22] language that it comes from uh and and
[52:25] their songs about it, but usually we
[52:28] think of of of the first uh the first
[52:32] meanings which would be of honor and of
[52:36] praise and of worship uh of splendor and
[52:40] magnificence and preeminence. We think
[52:43] of those things. But it it also goes
[52:46] much further than that. Uh we think of
[52:49] something that is that honor and worship
[52:53] belongs to God and to his kingly majesty
[52:58] and to Jesus Christ. We give him worship
[53:01] in our songs. We freely interchange you
[53:04] know God and we interchange father and
[53:07] we interchange and speak about uh the
[53:10] lord Jesus Christ because they are in in
[53:13] our understanding in the teaching of the
[53:15] scripture they are one
[53:18] and uh but it also comes from another
[53:20] word and this is going to be a surprise
[53:22] to you. We think of I'm speaking about
[53:25] honor now and I'm thinking about glory
[53:27] and glorious
[53:30] it is it comes from a root word to think
[53:35] to suppose
[53:38] to be an of to be of an opinion.
[53:43] I think and I judge things to be such.
[53:46] Now just hold it there.
[53:50] God focused on redemption. That was in
[53:54] his mind.
[53:56] And when Jesus said, "The hour is come,"
[53:59] that was the hour God had been thinking
[54:02] about.
[54:03] &gt;&gt; This is the hour I'm going to destroy my
[54:07] enemy.
[54:09] &gt;&gt; This is the hour I'm going to strip him.
[54:13] &gt;&gt; This is the hour I'm going to do away
[54:15] with death.
[54:17] This is the hour I'm going to free my
[54:19] children.
[54:22] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[54:24] &gt;&gt; And I began to think about the great
[54:25] battles. And I looked up some of the
[54:28] great battles. I'm not going to bore you
[54:30] with it, but there's the battle of
[54:31] Trfalgar and the battle of uh in Russia.
[54:34] In fact, as Russia's just been going
[54:36] through celebrations,
[54:38] uh I don't know, they have 15 days of
[54:40] celebrations or something. And uh Mr.
[54:43] Putin has just been up and he spoke of
[54:46] the glorious army and the glorious
[54:50] nation and the glorious Russian people
[54:54] and the glorious this. Why? because they
[54:56] won certain victories in the Second
[54:58] World War when uh Nazi armies came
[55:01] through France and they came, you know,
[55:04] the the arc of triumph or whatever and
[55:07] then they were able to march through
[55:09] there and and people always think of it
[55:12] the glories of the spoil, the glories of
[55:16] the victory, the glories of this army.
[55:19] And yet they're rejoicing over death and
[55:21] destruction and turmoil and broken homes
[55:24] and broken lives and broken bodies and
[55:27] spilled blood on the earth. How can that
[55:30] be glorious? But this is a glorious one.
[55:33] One was going to die.
[55:35] &gt;&gt; One was going to shed his blood.
[55:38] &gt;&gt; And it was going to be the blood of the
[55:40] new creation.
[55:41] And this is where, as I said last week,
[55:44] this new creation, this blood cell,
[55:46] that's where Satan got stopped. And God
[55:49] was going to break that blood cell.
[55:52] Hallelujah. And let the spirit from that
[55:54] one come back into his children again
[55:58] and have sons and daughters of God.
[56:01] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And that's why it's a
[56:03] glorious a glorious cross, a glorious
[56:07] victory. And that's the focus of
[56:10] eternity. Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[56:13] Hallelujah to the lamb.
[56:17] Glory to God. Don't you ever be ashamed
[56:20] to give glory to God and the Lord Jesus
[56:24] Christ that paid the price.
[56:26] &gt;&gt; For this hour, for this cause, I came
[56:33] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[56:35] Uh, brother Brandham spoke in the Srian
[56:38] church age said when the Holy Ghost came
[56:42] upon Mary, he created within her womb
[56:46] the cell that would multiply and become
[56:49] the body of our Lord Jesus. And he said
[56:53] that cell was created. It was the
[56:56] beginning of the creation of God.
[57:02] Those of you that follow the message,
[57:04] you know that is the statement that was
[57:07] made to the last messenger, the
[57:10] Leodysian church. Thus said the amen and
[57:14] faithful and true witness, the beginning
[57:17] of the creation of God. He announced it
[57:20] himself and he only announced it to the
[57:22] seventh church age messenger. He wanted
[57:25] to let him know because that messenger,
[57:27] a prophet messenger had to also be
[57:30] invested with creative power in a third
[57:33] pole ministry. Speak the word
[57:37] &gt;&gt; and so shall it be.
[57:39] &gt;&gt; Glory to God.
[57:41] &gt;&gt; What a glorious message we have. This
[57:43] isn't mere religion, friends. We're not
[57:46] a We're not a gathering like most
[57:48] gatherings are. We have a different kind
[57:51] of a message. I don't know you a
[57:53] different kind of a a vindication. We
[57:56] have a message that's been proven,
[58:00] &gt;&gt; a proven message
[58:03] &gt;&gt; and you can have confidence in it.
[58:06] &gt;&gt; The cell was created the beginning of
[58:08] the creation of God.
[58:11] That is who Jesus is. And that and that
[58:15] holy one was filled with holy blood. Oh,
[58:18] listen to these words. This is
[58:20] incredible. That holy one was filled
[58:23] with holy blood, even the blood of God.
[58:26] For the scripture says so. That
[58:28] tabernacle came to birth. He said he
[58:31] grew to be a man. He went to Jordan and
[58:34] there the sacrifice was washed of John
[58:37] in the river called Jordan. And when
[58:40] that acceptable sacrifice rose out of
[58:43] the water, God came and dwelt in him,
[58:46] dwelt him, filling him with the spirit
[58:48] without measure. And when he died and
[58:52] shed his blood, that perfect life of God
[58:55] was liberated to come back upon the
[58:58] sinner who would accept that Christ as
[59:01] his savior.
[59:02] &gt;&gt; That's the whole story in one paragraph.
[59:07] &gt;&gt; You talk about a victory.
[59:10] He said, "And when that blood cell and
[59:12] the token when that blood cell was
[59:14] broke, it released God through the
[59:17] sanctifying power that the blood had to
[59:21] come back to the believers."
[59:23] &gt;&gt; That's why in the whole Old Testament,
[59:25] all the blood that was shed, the animal
[59:26] blood, but the there was nothing to no
[59:29] life to come back upon the believer.
[59:32] Now, I take a quick turn. For those of
[59:35] you that know the message and those of
[59:37] you that don't know it that well, you
[59:39] should come to know it. In the messages
[59:42] conferences in Tucson,
[59:44] now in 63,
[59:47] he speaks of the seven seals. And when
[59:49] the lamb came forth to claim his
[59:53] redemption,
[59:55] &gt;&gt; what he'd redeemed,
[59:57] &gt;&gt; time was finished then. And he's in the
[59:59] he's in the work now.
[1:00:01] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:00:02] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:00:04] He's in the work now.
[1:00:06] &gt;&gt; I'm glad he's in the work now. Aren't
[1:00:09] you?
[1:00:10] &gt;&gt; Doing the work of redemption.
[1:00:14] &gt;&gt; Someday he walks from the sanctuary to
[1:00:18] take up the book of redemption which was
[1:00:20] right there in the seals. He comes and
[1:00:23] takes the book of redemption that he's
[1:00:25] purchased with his own blood. Now we're
[1:00:28] talking about Calvary. And then we're
[1:00:30] talking about him taking the book of
[1:00:31] redemption. But someday he walks from
[1:00:34] the sanctuary to take up the book of
[1:00:35] redemption that he's purchased with his
[1:00:38] own blood. Then the hour is over. He
[1:00:41] comes forth then to claim what he has
[1:00:44] redeemed. So this morning I want to
[1:00:47] begin by saying the reason why Calvary
[1:00:51] is such an incredible
[1:00:54] uh uh uh not merely an experience but an
[1:00:57] incredible emblem for us is that number
[1:01:00] one there's two things. Number one, he
[1:01:03] made the purchase
[1:01:05] &gt;&gt; and then when he would be revealed again
[1:01:08] in the end time he makes the claim
[1:01:11] &gt;&gt; on what he purchased. Number one, when
[1:01:14] he made the purchase, we're in the
[1:01:16] devil's pawn shop.
[1:01:18] &gt;&gt; But when he comes and claims it, we're
[1:01:20] out of the devil's pawn shop.
[1:01:23] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And so the cross stands for
[1:01:26] two things, very important things.
[1:01:28] Number one, God took the devil to task.
[1:01:31] God broke the powers of the enemy.
[1:01:34] Hallelujah. And then he comes in the end
[1:01:37] time to make his final claim. Amen.
[1:01:41] &gt;&gt; He's made his claim, friends.
[1:01:44] &gt;&gt; And the dead in Christ shall rise. Those
[1:01:47] who died in the faith. And I would say
[1:01:50] we have to be alive and quickened and
[1:01:53] filled with the Holy Spirit that we
[1:01:55] might identify. Not all will see those
[1:01:58] that raised from the dead. Matthew 27
[1:02:01] said that many bodies of the saints were
[1:02:04] seen in Jerusalem. They were seen in
[1:02:07] Jerusalem. But what it doesn't tell us
[1:02:08] is who saw them.
[1:02:12] &gt;&gt; The disciples saw them cuz they wrote
[1:02:14] about them.
[1:02:16] &gt;&gt; Herod didn't see them.
[1:02:18] &gt;&gt; Ananas the high priest didn't see them.
[1:02:20] Pharisees didn't see them. Scribes
[1:02:22] didn't see them. Synagogues didn't see
[1:02:24] them. Rabbis didn't see them. But some
[1:02:26] believers saw them.
[1:02:28] &gt;&gt; And if you go to Luke the 24th chapter,
[1:02:30] you'll find even even believers had
[1:02:33] trouble.
[1:02:35] Jesus, the word himself, walking with
[1:02:37] them in that new body, walking with
[1:02:39] them. And the prophecy now coming at the
[1:02:42] end time, one of the last sermons that
[1:02:44] was preached for you to read, tells us
[1:02:46] that that is a prophecy. If it's a
[1:02:49] prophecy, then it must be fulfilled. And
[1:02:52] if they had trouble back then, there's
[1:02:53] going to be folks having trouble today.
[1:02:57] They'll have trouble today. What's
[1:02:59] happening? The whole thing's falling
[1:03:01] apart. The message is falling apart. No,
[1:03:04] it's not falling apart, friends. It's
[1:03:06] right on time.
[1:03:09] Hallelujah. It's right on time. It's
[1:03:12] right on schedule. It's us that get out
[1:03:15] of time. And I say we need to get in
[1:03:18] harmony with this word of God. We need
[1:03:20] to get in harmony with this message.
[1:03:23] &gt;&gt; We need to give it foremost.
[1:03:25] &gt;&gt; It needs to become supreme in our minds.
[1:03:28] Let this mind be in you.
[1:03:32] This is what God had in his mind. This
[1:03:35] is what God had in his thoughts.
[1:03:37] Victory.
[1:03:39] Victory.
[1:03:40] Destruction of the enemy.
[1:03:43] Purchasing my children. Filling them
[1:03:46] with my spirit. Making them part of the
[1:03:49] new creation by the Holy Ghost.
[1:03:52] Hallelujah. And claiming them in the end
[1:03:55] time and taking them home.
[1:04:00] Glory.
[1:04:02] &gt;&gt; That's the message.
[1:04:05] &gt;&gt; That's the message.
[1:04:10] &gt;&gt; Glory to God.
[1:04:13] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. I hope you can participate.
[1:04:16] I'm not just excited as a preacher. I'm
[1:04:18] excited at the word.
[1:04:22] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:04:24] I can come to this pulpit feeling like a
[1:04:26] stick of wood. But before I start
[1:04:28] reading some of the things God's prophet
[1:04:30] said, it just comes with new life.
[1:04:34] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:04:37] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. He
[1:04:39] &gt;&gt; said when the seven seals were opened
[1:04:43] &gt;&gt; and thus he reads the scripture also
[1:04:47] brother Brandham in the seals
[1:04:53] first in the rising of the sun I'm going
[1:04:55] to read two or three quotes here
[1:04:58] &gt;&gt; but I'd like to say
[1:05:01] so glory
[1:05:04] to glory is also to have it in your mind
[1:05:08] and That's what was in God's mind.
[1:05:10] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:05:11] &gt;&gt; And it also is to show or to expose
[1:05:16] to vision,
[1:05:17] &gt;&gt; to expose to the eyes and to give
[1:05:20] evidence and proof.
[1:05:23] And I tell you what, Calvary in the
[1:05:26] resurrection was proof of who he was.
[1:05:30] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. He didn't just live and
[1:05:32] claim some things. He proved them. Amen.
[1:05:36] &gt;&gt; This message didn't come as a new way to
[1:05:39] believe. This message did not come to
[1:05:41] establish some more churches
[1:05:43] &gt;&gt; or just to or or even just to give us
[1:05:45] some things that were lost down. This
[1:05:47] message came as proof
[1:05:50] &gt;&gt; that he was resurrected. And that's why
[1:05:53] the messenger said all the time in the
[1:05:55] in the earlier part of his ministry to
[1:05:57] prove and let God let the God who I've
[1:06:01] spoken of. If this is the truth, let him
[1:06:03] come now and prove what I've spoken is
[1:06:07] the truth. Listen to me, my brother, my
[1:06:09] sister, and all who are on the internet
[1:06:11] and all who may be on the telephone
[1:06:12] hookup. Listen, I have a statement to
[1:06:15] make. This message has been proven by a
[1:06:18] supernatural act of almighty God to have
[1:06:21] been true
[1:06:24] &gt;&gt; by multitudes of healings and multitudes
[1:06:26] of the revealing of the secret of the
[1:06:28] heart. You can hear it if you have time.
[1:06:31] And the and the fact that seven angels
[1:06:33] came in a great cloud from the heavens,
[1:06:36] angels in a split, that was only another
[1:06:39] one of the proofs.
[1:06:42] &gt;&gt; Just another one of many. Amen.
[1:06:46] &gt;&gt; All you folks need to rejoice over that
[1:06:48] &gt;&gt; to think that that God called you
[1:06:51] &gt;&gt; and made that known to you.
[1:06:54] &gt;&gt; And if it's not revealed to you, say,
[1:06:56] "Oh God, make this real to me before I
[1:06:59] leave this place.
[1:07:02] &gt;&gt; Let it be real to me."
[1:07:05] Hallelujah.
[1:07:10] &gt;&gt; Jesus Christ was the evidence of the
[1:07:13] deity
[1:07:14] &gt;&gt; of God here on earth.
[1:07:17] &gt;&gt; His resurrection was the evidence of the
[1:07:20] defeat of Satan.
[1:07:22] &gt;&gt; Listen to me, friends. Satan is
[1:07:24] defeated.
[1:07:26] &gt;&gt; I determined when I was coming to the
[1:07:28] pulpit today, I'm going to rejoice over
[1:07:31] his defeat.
[1:07:33] I'm going to rejoice over his
[1:07:34] wickedness.
[1:07:36] &gt;&gt; I'm going to rejoice over the spoils of
[1:07:38] this victory we have sitting here. Those
[1:07:41] that have been healed, I rejoice over
[1:07:44] the spoils of victory.
[1:07:48] This to me is the glory of God.
[1:07:54] &gt;&gt; I want to move it away from just singing
[1:07:56] a song
[1:07:57] &gt;&gt; and imagining worship.
[1:07:59] &gt;&gt; I want to bring it to a reality. We have
[1:08:03] the glory of the spoils of victory over
[1:08:07] Satan.
[1:08:10] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:08:12] &gt;&gt; And we have some who are afflicted and
[1:08:15] some who are sick and some who are still
[1:08:17] bound and some who are still blinded. I
[1:08:20] want to rejoice with you that your eyes
[1:08:23] can be opened
[1:08:24] &gt;&gt; and that your life and soul can be
[1:08:26] loosed
[1:08:28] &gt;&gt; from the enemy.
[1:08:30] And some of you who may be calling on
[1:08:33] God for those that are not here in his
[1:08:35] presence, we claim them in the name of
[1:08:38] Jesus Christ. And I have also spoken my
[1:08:42] own words in prayer. Satan, you have no
[1:08:45] power.
[1:08:47] I am gloring in Calvary.
[1:08:51] I'm gloring in the cross.
[1:08:54] I'm gloring because you were defeated.
[1:08:58] And I want to inspire you to believe.
[1:09:03] &gt;&gt; We have nothing else here.
[1:09:05] &gt;&gt; What are we going to glory in?
[1:09:07] &gt;&gt; Some education, some university, some
[1:09:10] college. What are we going to glory in?
[1:09:12] Uh some team wins. Our favorite hometown
[1:09:16] team wins. What are we going to glory
[1:09:19] in? No, we glory in the cross.
[1:09:22] &gt;&gt; We glory in the victory of our heavenly
[1:09:25] father.
[1:09:27] Hallelujah.
[1:09:28] &gt;&gt; Why do we say praise the Lord?
[1:09:32] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:09:33] &gt;&gt; We're going to freely give him glory.
[1:09:37] &gt;&gt; The devil has held you long enough.
[1:09:39] &gt;&gt; The devil has shaded your eyes long
[1:09:41] enough.
[1:09:43] &gt;&gt; As a as brother Murphy said on the last
[1:09:45] meeting, push the button.
[1:09:48] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Release the bomb.
[1:09:51] Let the enemy know he's defeated
[1:09:54] &gt;&gt; and he can't hold you any longer.
[1:10:02] &gt;&gt; And the ministry of Luke 17:30,
[1:10:05] the revealing of the son of man in this
[1:10:08] day is the evidence.
[1:10:11] &gt;&gt; Don't lose the evidence.
[1:10:13] &gt;&gt; If you come into a court, you'll need
[1:10:15] evidence.
[1:10:17] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And we have the evidence.
[1:10:22] that he had returned
[1:10:24] &gt;&gt; to claim his own.
[1:10:27] &gt;&gt; We're living in the time of redemption's
[1:10:29] claims.
[1:10:31] &gt;&gt; Glory to God.
[1:10:34] &gt;&gt; In the rising of the sun, he said that
[1:10:37] is the identification that we are
[1:10:39] beneficiaries with him
[1:10:41] &gt;&gt; in the resurrection.
[1:10:43] &gt;&gt; He proves what he's talked about.
[1:10:46] &gt;&gt; That's the evidence we have. He has
[1:10:49] proved what he talked about.
[1:10:51] &gt;&gt; Our Lord Jesus in the messengers
[1:10:53] ministry, that ministry that called you
[1:10:56] into this service today, he proved what
[1:10:59] he was talking about.
[1:11:02] &gt;&gt; We don't just have some theology. We
[1:11:04] have a proven message.
[1:11:07] &gt;&gt; One that never never God never let the
[1:11:10] words fall to the ground.
[1:11:14] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:11:16] a proven message.
[1:11:18] &gt;&gt; He said, "What he promised to do in
[1:11:20] Christ, he proved it
[1:11:22] &gt;&gt; in the resurrection. What he promised to
[1:11:25] do in the days of Moses, he proved it.
[1:11:28] What he promised to do in the days of
[1:11:30] Enoch, he proved it.
[1:11:32] &gt;&gt; In the days of the apostles, he proved
[1:11:35] it." That's wonderful, isn't it? But
[1:11:38] then he goes on, "And now."
[1:11:41] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. You ought to say it. And now
[1:11:45] in this day, he proves what he said.
[1:11:50] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:11:51] &gt;&gt; And that's why we have a congregation of
[1:11:54] people that rejoice. And what we're
[1:11:57] rejoicing in is a victory at Calvary,
[1:12:01] the crossroads of humanity. And here we
[1:12:04] are in the end time rejoicing because he
[1:12:08] proves his claim.
[1:12:12] Hallelujah.
[1:12:16] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:12:17] &gt;&gt; When he came to the first seal,
[1:12:20] now we have seven seals.
[1:12:23] Follow me closely.
[1:12:27] I've always desired if I could convey to
[1:12:29] the people
[1:12:31] the supernatural aspect of this message.
[1:12:36] &gt;&gt; Amen. Brother Brandham when he preaches
[1:12:38] and you you're hearing words and say,
[1:12:40] "Well, I heard a tape. I heard a
[1:12:42] message. I read a message." I must
[1:12:44] convey to you one line he may be
[1:12:48] speaking about the congregation or
[1:12:50] what's right there. One line he might be
[1:12:52] speaking about somebody who's sick and
[1:12:54] afflicted, whatever. And the next line
[1:12:57] he may be completely into the eternities
[1:13:00] &gt;&gt; and bringing a thought
[1:13:03] &gt;&gt; from God into your mind. Amen.
[1:13:07] &gt;&gt; And you might be inclined to think,
[1:13:09] well, you know, kind of where what is he
[1:13:12] saying and where did that come from?
[1:13:13] That's for you to ponder and to pray and
[1:13:16] to say, let this mind
[1:13:20] &gt;&gt; be in me,
[1:13:22] &gt;&gt; which was also in Christ, and it's in
[1:13:24] the revealing of Christ.
[1:13:26] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:13:28] &gt;&gt; God. And in this day, he proves what he
[1:13:30] said because they are a part of that
[1:13:33] seed that was represented
[1:13:36] &gt;&gt; on the book of life that he came to
[1:13:39] redeem back to God again.
[1:13:41] &gt;&gt; Oh, he said, "Oh, what a message."
[1:13:45] &gt;&gt; He's the preacher, but he said, "Oh,
[1:13:47] what a message." Because it wasn't his
[1:13:50] message.
[1:13:53] &gt;&gt; It's God's message.
[1:13:57] So we come to the first seal and in the
[1:14:00] first seal you'll find a long I don't
[1:14:03] want you to get lost in the technical
[1:14:05] parts but he about paragraph 145 when
[1:14:09] you're in your seals book and he says
[1:14:13] because he's just starting
[1:14:15] &gt;&gt; hallelujah
[1:14:16] &gt;&gt; he said well you say
[1:14:21] well him coming to the end of the road
[1:14:25] and you got trouble.
[1:14:28] What does it make you think when some
[1:14:31] great spiritual thing happens that
[1:14:34] troubles you? Now, not trying to
[1:14:36] interpret this for you, but he just was
[1:14:39] reading the scripture.
[1:14:41] He was reading the scripture. Now, my
[1:14:43] soul is troubled.
[1:14:45] He just read that scripture.
[1:14:52] And now Jesus is saying, "And now my
[1:14:56] soul is troubled."
[1:14:59] Not troubled because he thought he's
[1:15:00] going to be defeated,
[1:15:03] but the awful suffering that was coming,
[1:15:08] the weight of the world.
[1:15:12] &gt;&gt; Listen folks, sometimes, most times, we
[1:15:15] can't we can't handle the weight of our
[1:15:17] own failures.
[1:15:21] We can't handle the weight of our own
[1:15:23] past.
[1:15:24] &gt;&gt; We have trouble with the weight of our
[1:15:26] own sin.
[1:15:28] &gt;&gt; Here's one. The beginning of the new
[1:15:31] creation
[1:15:32] &gt;&gt; that has the sin of the world upon his
[1:15:35] shoulders.
[1:15:38] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:15:39] &gt;&gt; You didn't understand that.
[1:15:41] &gt;&gt; The sin of the world.
[1:15:43] &gt;&gt; Not your failures only. The sin of the
[1:15:45] world.
[1:15:46] &gt;&gt; The sin of every prostitute. the sin of
[1:15:49] every criminal, the sin of every the sin
[1:15:52] of the world. This is the one who knows
[1:15:55] how to do battle with Satan.
[1:15:59] &gt;&gt; And he came as a result of the word for
[1:16:03] a virgin shall conceive. And that's how
[1:16:05] he was born. And the words of God were
[1:16:09] locked were lodged in the womb of a
[1:16:11] virgin. And thus came this God man,
[1:16:16] &gt;&gt; the son of God.
[1:16:18] Hallelujah.
[1:16:20] &gt;&gt; And God was in him
[1:16:22] &gt;&gt; reconciling the world to himself.
[1:16:25] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:16:26] &gt;&gt; We can't comprehend that. And so in
[1:16:28] saying now, Father,
[1:16:32] I'm troubled.
[1:16:37] And now is my soul troubled. And what
[1:16:40] shall I say?
[1:16:43] Father, save me from this hour.
[1:16:48] For this cause came I into the world.
[1:16:53] &gt;&gt; But it's a dark hour. It's a hard hour.
[1:16:57] &gt;&gt; The spirit's going to leave him and he's
[1:16:59] going to cry out when even his closest
[1:17:02] disciples like you and I might see
[1:17:05] ourselves as being faithful disciples.
[1:17:08] But because of the heaviness of their
[1:17:10] own heart heart and seeing their master
[1:17:13] in his heaviness, they fell asleep.
[1:17:16] in the garden of called Gethsemane.
[1:17:19] And there he falls on his face and sweat
[1:17:21] from his face as though it were great
[1:17:23] drops of blood. And he's crying out,
[1:17:26] "Father, if it's possible,
[1:17:29] &gt;&gt; let this cup pass from me,
[1:17:32] &gt;&gt; but nevertheless,
[1:17:34] &gt;&gt; not my will, but thine be done."
[1:17:38] &gt;&gt; What an example.
[1:17:41] &gt;&gt; What a savior. What a shepherd. What a
[1:17:43] leader.
[1:17:47] who for the joy that was set before him
[1:17:50] &gt;&gt; endured the cross.
[1:17:54] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:17:55] &gt;&gt; Counting the shame as a joy.
[1:17:59] &gt;&gt; Because he knew who was it? Who was the
[1:18:02] joy that what what was the joy that was
[1:18:04] set before him?
[1:18:06] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:18:07] &gt;&gt; My wife,
[1:18:09] &gt;&gt; my wife, my bride,
[1:18:12] &gt;&gt; my elect. Amen.
[1:18:14] &gt;&gt; We can't feel worthy of that. But we
[1:18:16] must accept that was it
[1:18:18] &gt;&gt; because he came and called you. He came
[1:18:20] and he came and found you.
[1:18:22] &gt;&gt; He came and reached down maybe through
[1:18:24] gener generations of families and found
[1:18:27] you.
[1:18:31] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:18:33] &gt;&gt; We had some wanderings and some
[1:18:34] stumblings and look where we came from.
[1:18:37] Look where you came from.
[1:18:43] Who for the joy
[1:18:45] if you could only find yourself in that
[1:18:48] place today and say
[1:18:51] he saw me.
[1:18:52] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:18:55] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:18:55] &gt;&gt; He saw me. He knew I would be here.
[1:18:59] &gt;&gt; He knew I'd hear his voice.
[1:19:02] &gt;&gt; He knew I'd recognize it as a great
[1:19:04] shepherd.
[1:19:05] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:19:07] &gt;&gt; He knew I'd be moved. He knew I had to
[1:19:10] give myself and surrender my life
[1:19:12] &gt;&gt; to him who for the joy that was set
[1:19:14] before him endured the cross
[1:19:19] and now my soul and brother Brandham is
[1:19:22] reading these scriptures. Now listen
[1:19:25] and please
[1:19:27] have
[1:19:29] some discernment
[1:19:31] have a spiritual mind. Now he's here's
[1:19:34] seven angels of first in December he's
[1:19:38] had a serious time
[1:19:42] and he's had the vision
[1:19:44] &gt;&gt; of the meeting of the angels of God.
[1:19:46] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:19:47] &gt;&gt; Saying they will come from eternity when
[1:19:50] he tried to describe it they came out of
[1:19:52] the eternities in a split.
[1:19:53] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:19:55] &gt;&gt; Didn't have even a moment to think about
[1:19:57] it.
[1:20:01] And in the vision, he's in a room and
[1:20:04] his wife is tapping on the door,
[1:20:08] it says, "And it seems that my Bible was
[1:20:11] open."
[1:20:12] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:20:14] &gt;&gt; I'll let you have an exercise.
[1:20:17] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:20:17] &gt;&gt; Take your Bibles.
[1:20:27] Open it to Romans.
[1:20:31] where you find the ninth chapter.
[1:20:49] Now he's going to tell
[1:20:51] the vision.
[1:20:54] You got it open to Romans nine.
[1:20:59] Is it open to any special verse?
[1:21:04] No, it's just open to Romans 9.
[1:21:09] But if you read in the seals, he'll tell
[1:21:12] you it was open to Romans the 9th
[1:21:15] chapter, the 33rd verse.
[1:21:24] Now, just before you get too caught up
[1:21:27] in that verse, let me tell you what's
[1:21:29] happening.
[1:21:31] Here is this messenger.
[1:21:35] And Elijah spirit that has come been
[1:21:37] sent onto the earth.
[1:21:40] The last messenger to come
[1:21:42] &gt;&gt; had to be a prophet messenger to tell
[1:21:44] what has been and what will be. Amen.
[1:21:48] &gt;&gt; And now he's coming right to the crux
[1:21:50] &gt;&gt; of his message, the critical. This is
[1:21:52] the very epic part.
[1:21:55] &gt;&gt; He's coming right to that one. And so
[1:21:58] before he even comes, God gives him
[1:22:00] another vision. He's had thousands of
[1:22:02] visions
[1:22:03] &gt;&gt; and has proved them
[1:22:06] &gt;&gt; over and over
[1:22:08] &gt;&gt; and made it made it available to you
[1:22:10] scientific people. You can read it. You
[1:22:13] can hear it. You can bring it out of
[1:22:16] space, do whatever you want, but God is
[1:22:19] going to judge this world because he
[1:22:20] gave him an opportunity. And they didn't
[1:22:23] even take the time
[1:22:25] &gt;&gt; to determine. He says, "Here's my proof.
[1:22:27] I'm proving it to you. I'm proving it to
[1:22:29] you."
[1:22:30] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:22:31] &gt;&gt; Wouldn't you like something proven? And
[1:22:33] yet, we open up our ears to every kind
[1:22:35] of gobblegook and this, that, and the
[1:22:37] other thing, and no proof to it
[1:22:39] whatsoever. Just a bunch of fantasy and
[1:22:42] a bunch of nonsense. Here we have a
[1:22:44] proven message.
[1:22:47] &gt;&gt; Friends, I'm going to dig it into the
[1:22:49] devil good today.
[1:22:52] &gt;&gt; The devil has nothing like this.
[1:22:56] &gt;&gt; The church world has nothing like this.
[1:23:01] &gt;&gt; God has proven this to you. And all of
[1:23:04] you that are sitting here listening to
[1:23:05] me, I'm going to dig it in deep. God
[1:23:07] proved it to you.
[1:23:12] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen.
[1:23:13] &gt;&gt; He will be without excuse.
[1:23:15] &gt;&gt; He's brought the world to a court case.
[1:23:18] &gt;&gt; And that's why the prophet spoke the
[1:23:20] trial again and again and again. And he
[1:23:24] was a representative
[1:23:27] &gt;&gt; for the almighty God
[1:23:30] &gt;&gt; cuz he could stand and prove
[1:23:33] &gt;&gt; this God. This pillar of fire who I said
[1:23:36] is here standing between I and the woman
[1:23:38] or I and the man standing here at the
[1:23:41] pulpit not two feet away from me over
[1:23:43] and over and over again and then proved
[1:23:45] that he was there
[1:23:48] &gt;&gt; in the supernatural
[1:23:55] &gt;&gt; and so now the seals that have been
[1:23:57] sealed in the back part of God's mind
[1:23:59] the secrets
[1:24:01] &gt;&gt; and what does he say in that verse and
[1:24:03] he tells his messenger. His messenger
[1:24:05] says, "It seems that my Bible was open
[1:24:07] to Romans 9:33."
[1:24:10] 9:33 is an announcement. Behold,
[1:24:14] &gt;&gt; attentional.
[1:24:17] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:24:19] &gt;&gt; I lay in Zion,
[1:24:21] &gt;&gt; a stumbling stone.
[1:24:23] &gt;&gt; Who is it? The revealing of Jesus
[1:24:26] Christ.
[1:24:28] &gt;&gt; And the rock of offense.
[1:24:31] Not a rock of acceptance, but a rock of
[1:24:33] rejection. The same one that was
[1:24:36] crucified. Hallelujah. But there the
[1:24:39] cell was broken. And now he's going to
[1:24:42] claim what he what he purchased.
[1:24:50] &gt;&gt; Isn't it worthwhile rejoicing, friends?
[1:24:54] &gt;&gt; I come to claim you. We talk about this
[1:24:57] message, but this message is his claim
[1:25:00] on you.
[1:25:01] &gt;&gt; He's claimed you
[1:25:03] &gt;&gt; and that's why it means something to
[1:25:04] you.
[1:25:05] &gt;&gt; If you're here this morning, it doesn't
[1:25:07] mean a thing to you.
[1:25:09] &gt;&gt; I'd be worried.
[1:25:11] &gt;&gt; If it doesn't mean a thing to you, you
[1:25:13] better prepare for the tribulation.
[1:25:16] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. I'm not trying to be harsh.
[1:25:18] I'm just trying to be gentle.
[1:25:20] &gt;&gt; You need to rejoice
[1:25:23] &gt;&gt; that he claimed you.
[1:25:26] for his own. This message is his claim.
[1:25:30] &gt;&gt; And the spirit of God that brought the
[1:25:32] message is the same spirit that
[1:25:34] quickened you to it.
[1:25:42] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:25:46] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Yeah.
[1:25:47] &gt;&gt; And so he's in the first seal
[1:25:50] and he's saying,
[1:25:52] &gt;&gt; "Father,
[1:25:54] glorify thy name."
[1:25:58] &gt;&gt; And there came a voice from heaven
[1:26:00] saying,
[1:26:01] &gt;&gt; "Praise God." Amen.
[1:26:03] &gt;&gt; I have both glorified it
[1:26:07] &gt;&gt; and will glorify it again.
[1:26:12] &gt;&gt; It was a glory. It was a glorifying over
[1:26:16] the defeat of Satan and over the
[1:26:18] purchase of God's children. But he would
[1:26:21] glorify again in the end time when the
[1:26:24] seals are open and the family of God is
[1:26:27] gathered.
[1:26:32] &gt;&gt; I want to say to you that God is present
[1:26:35] on the scene now glorying himself. He's
[1:26:39] being glorified. that what he purchased
[1:26:42] back there is being gathered together
[1:26:44] and he's going to defeat the ultimate
[1:26:46] death and raise his children out of the
[1:26:49] grave.
[1:26:52] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:26:56] &gt;&gt; And going to change these bodies. How? I
[1:27:00] don't know. But there'll be a sweep
[1:27:02] that'll go over us.
[1:27:04] &gt;&gt; I assume you'll be taking one step in
[1:27:06] time and the next step in eternity.
[1:27:10] Glory to God.
[1:27:15] Here's our word. We shall not all sleep.
[1:27:19] We shall not all sleep, but we shall all
[1:27:22] be changed.
[1:27:26] &gt;&gt; That's his word. And if he proved every
[1:27:29] other one, he'll prove this one also.
[1:27:34] &gt;&gt; Glory to God.
[1:27:41] And that's why at the first seal, he
[1:27:43] must bring this in.
[1:27:45] &gt;&gt; At the very beginning of the first seal,
[1:27:49] I have both glorified it
[1:27:51] &gt;&gt; and will glorify it again.
[1:27:53] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:27:55] &gt;&gt; And he said, "And I saw when the lamb
[1:27:58] opened one of the seals,"
[1:28:00] &gt;&gt; he said, "what happened."
[1:28:01] &gt;&gt; And I heard as it was a noise of a
[1:28:04] thunder. Amen.
[1:28:05] &gt;&gt; And oh, he said, I'd like to dwell on
[1:28:07] that just a few minutes. I hope now that
[1:28:09] all the people that know these things
[1:28:12] and are waiting for the consolation of
[1:28:14] the Lord
[1:28:15] &gt;&gt; and those that are, and I said, I'm
[1:28:17] speaking to people that are here and
[1:28:19] waiting for the consolation of the Lord.
[1:28:22] &gt;&gt; He said, well, now study real close.
[1:28:25] &gt;&gt; So, you don't only be here waiting for
[1:28:27] the consolation of the Lord, but study
[1:28:30] real close. That's why I'm preaching
[1:28:32] today. I'm preaching this in detail so
[1:28:35] that you and I together can study real
[1:28:38] close.
[1:28:42] &gt;&gt; What it is that this messenger is saying
[1:28:46] &gt;&gt; study real close and on the tapes also
[1:28:48] that you think of this. The first thing
[1:28:51] happened when the lamb broke the first
[1:28:54] seal
[1:28:55] &gt;&gt; a thunder roared.
[1:28:57] &gt;&gt; He said now that's got a significance.
[1:29:00] It's got a meaning. Yeah,
[1:29:02] &gt;&gt; it's a meaning. Nothing happens without
[1:29:04] a meaning.
[1:29:06] &gt;&gt; All right, he said a thunder, a thunder
[1:29:08] roared.
[1:29:09] &gt;&gt; Wonder what the thunder was. And he goes
[1:29:11] back to John's gospel where it says in
[1:29:14] that verse and and there was a thunder.
[1:29:17] He said, "Glorify thyself. I have
[1:29:20] glorified and I will glorify it again."
[1:29:23] &gt;&gt; And they said, "And a thunder spoke
[1:29:25] out."
[1:29:25] &gt;&gt; Amen. and and and Jesus said that was
[1:29:29] that that that voice came
[1:29:32] &gt;&gt; not for me but for you.
[1:29:35] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:29:36] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:29:37] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:29:38] &gt;&gt; Glory.
[1:29:39] &gt;&gt; Oh, thank you, Jesus.
[1:29:42] &gt;&gt; Am I going too fast?
[1:29:43] &gt;&gt; No, sir.
[1:29:44] &gt;&gt; You're all right.
[1:29:47] &gt;&gt; All right. And Jesus answering them,
[1:29:49] saying, "The hour has come
[1:29:51] &gt;&gt; that the Son of Man should be
[1:29:53] glorified."
[1:29:55] &gt;&gt; Glorified. what glorified in victory.
[1:29:58] &gt;&gt; What was it that had come?
[1:30:01] Now, if you were wise enough and if God
[1:30:04] allowed you to know
[1:30:06] the hour's come,
[1:30:08] &gt;&gt; amen
[1:30:09] that I am to depart this world.
[1:30:16] &gt;&gt; I'm going to be going now in just a few
[1:30:18] days.
[1:30:21] I have heard and I know and I met some
[1:30:25] who God allowed to know that
[1:30:28] there's a brother, a very humble pastor.
[1:30:31] I don't think he even had a church, but
[1:30:33] he was a worker.
[1:30:35] This brother,
[1:30:38] he would get on a a train in South
[1:30:40] Africa.
[1:30:42] He lived in one of the areas just out of
[1:30:44] Cape Town and he get on the train in the
[1:30:48] morning. He didn't care where the train
[1:30:50] was going. He just would and he would
[1:30:53] witness and hand out tracks and speak of
[1:30:56] the message and tell people of the
[1:30:57] message of the hour and the and what
[1:31:00] what God has done this time and he'd go
[1:31:03] for maybe half a day and then he'd just
[1:31:04] step off that train, get another one is
[1:31:06] going back and he just preached on the
[1:31:08] trains all the time one day and he had a
[1:31:12] prayer he had a a little building at the
[1:31:14] back of his property. lived real poor
[1:31:17] and he had a little building at the back
[1:31:19] of his property where he went and prayed
[1:31:22] and that was his place.
[1:31:24] His children had never been in there.
[1:31:28] The reason I know this so well is
[1:31:29] because his son who his son wanted me to
[1:31:34] adopt him and bring him to Canada.
[1:31:38] So I know these details very very well.
[1:31:41] And one day he said to his son, he said,
[1:31:44] "Uh, come with father."
[1:31:48] So he took his son and they went back to
[1:31:52] the back of the property
[1:31:54] and his son had never been in that place
[1:31:59] and he was he was somewhat spooked.
[1:32:02] I'd never been where father prays.
[1:32:06] And he went into place and there was
[1:32:07] pictures of some of the great ministers
[1:32:12] on the wall
[1:32:16] very holy sacred place.
[1:32:20] And he said now son he said
[1:32:24] you have become a man
[1:32:27] and you must be a man now. He said
[1:32:30] father's leaving.
[1:32:33] He said but where are you going? No. He
[1:32:35] said, "Father's going to be leaving you
[1:32:38] now."
[1:32:40] And here and he went and he got some
[1:32:43] things, some papers. He said, "Here's
[1:32:46] the payments on the car."
[1:32:48] And there's only one, it was either one
[1:32:51] or two payments that were left to be
[1:32:53] paid.
[1:32:55] And he got a little box and he said,
[1:32:57] "Here's the extra set of keys for the
[1:32:59] car.
[1:33:01] you are a man now
[1:33:03] and I want you to take good care of
[1:33:05] mother
[1:33:07] cuz father is leaving.
[1:33:10] And it was either the next day or the
[1:33:12] next day he just laid down and went to
[1:33:17] be with the Lord.
[1:33:19] There's no sickness.
[1:33:22] And that son, he was so moved, so
[1:33:26] effect, you can well imagine.
[1:33:28] and he and I communicated and I knew
[1:33:31] that
[1:33:33] uh he I could not take him. He was he
[1:33:36] was very very intently desiring. It
[1:33:40] wasn't just a passing. He warned me
[1:33:41] please adopt me so I may be your son.
[1:33:48] I don't know what became of his life but
[1:33:52] that was a wonderful brother and I've
[1:33:54] seen him a number of times.
[1:33:57] that brother, he was a minister, but he
[1:33:59] never had a church to my knowledge.
[1:34:04] Jesus
[1:34:05] knew he was going
[1:34:08] and he told his disciples and said, "The
[1:34:11] son of man must be slain."
[1:34:14] And the chief priests, he even said,
[1:34:16] "Who will do it?" The chief priests and
[1:34:18] the scribes, they will slay the son of
[1:34:21] man.
[1:34:24] And I'm leaving. And that's why when you
[1:34:26] read John's gospel, don't just read it
[1:34:28] like a book.
[1:34:30] &gt;&gt; It starts back in about the 13th chap
[1:34:33] 12th chapter, the supper at Bethany.
[1:34:35] This is just 6 days before he's going.
[1:34:37] He's going in a few days. And then he
[1:34:40] has a triumphal entry and they get a
[1:34:42] little colt of an ass and he rides into
[1:34:46] Jerusalem and they're waving palms and
[1:34:49] hosana and throwing their coats and
[1:34:52] jackets on the ground. So the so he can
[1:34:56] come over it and giving him such you'd
[1:34:59] say that's glory. No,
[1:35:03] when the cross
[1:35:05] with the blood, God's blood drenching
[1:35:08] out of that body
[1:35:10] &gt;&gt; soaking the earth, that was glory.
[1:35:14] &gt;&gt; That's where we were born. That's where
[1:35:16] the price was paid.
[1:35:19] &gt;&gt; Your healing was paid for in full. Your
[1:35:23] deliverance was paid for in full.
[1:35:27] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:35:29] &gt;&gt; Healing for every negative thing.
[1:35:32] &gt;&gt; I said to the brothers, a lot of us came
[1:35:35] from perhaps difficult backgrounds or
[1:35:40] whatever.
[1:35:42] Some perhaps didn't have much of a home.
[1:35:44] Some of you maybe here didn't have much
[1:35:47] of a home. Don't let Satan take that and
[1:35:50] hold it in front of you. say you can't
[1:35:53] be anything for God because of that.
[1:35:55] That was paid for.
[1:36:00] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:36:01] &gt;&gt; And you can take the most difficult
[1:36:03] thing in your life. You can take the
[1:36:05] most tumultous background in your life.
[1:36:09] It can never be an excuse for failing in
[1:36:12] God's kingdom because God paid for
[1:36:14] success for you.
[1:36:18] Hallelujah.
[1:36:20] &gt;&gt; I'm going to put it in the devil's face,
[1:36:22] friends.
[1:36:25] &gt;&gt; I'm not going to give personal
[1:36:26] testimony, but um my life was broke up.
[1:36:29] My whole home was broke up with mother's
[1:36:31] departure at 32 years old,
[1:36:35] gone
[1:36:36] in the home. And mother and father,
[1:36:38] stepmother and father were all over in
[1:36:41] construction camps. And I was boarded
[1:36:44] out here, there, this farm, that farm,
[1:36:46] this preacher's house, that place,
[1:36:48] blind, this blind woman's house, and her
[1:36:51] husband never had any children.
[1:36:56] When I got into my late teens, I decided
[1:37:00] now I can just become bitter about this.
[1:37:03] &gt;&gt; I haven't had a home.
[1:37:06] &gt;&gt; I haven't had a proper education.
[1:37:08] I haven't had the chances these other
[1:37:10] young people have had. I can become
[1:37:13] bitter about this or I can just take the
[1:37:16] things that I really feel
[1:37:19] &gt;&gt; I missed and I'm going to index it
[1:37:22] around and let it be a blessing to me.
[1:37:25] &gt;&gt; I'm going to let it make my heart more
[1:37:27] tender.
[1:37:29] &gt;&gt; I didn't have a home. I'll see that my
[1:37:30] kids have a home if God gives me his
[1:37:32] children.
[1:37:34] &gt;&gt; Didn't have that. a lot of things we
[1:37:36] didn't have and decided that the life
[1:37:39] that was really worthwhile is to pour
[1:37:42] all my strength and all my effort. Don't
[1:37:45] just listen to me now because I'm coming
[1:37:46] down very very I'm coming to your
[1:37:49] address. I just decided I'm going to do
[1:37:52] whatever I can. If the church needs to
[1:37:54] be swept, I'll sweep the church. If it
[1:37:56] needs some help building something, I'll
[1:37:58] build something. I'll be there. I'll
[1:38:00] work out in the yard. I'll work out on
[1:38:02] the porch. I'll do whatever. if I can be
[1:38:04] there and learn to play the guitar. So,
[1:38:06] I sat up and played the guitar. God
[1:38:07] bless you musicians. I just did that.
[1:38:10] Did that. And you just do that. And as
[1:38:12] God opens the door, I'm there. Whatever
[1:38:14] I can do, I'll be there. Do you hear me?
[1:38:20] &gt;&gt; Somebody needs to pick up the mantle.
[1:38:23] &gt;&gt; Even the prophet of God, he wondered who
[1:38:26] will carry this message on.
[1:38:30] We are privileged to carry a proven
[1:38:33] message on
[1:38:35] &gt;&gt; and give it voice.
[1:38:36] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:38:37] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And extend it
[1:38:40] &gt;&gt; and do whatever we can. What can I do?
[1:38:42] God will show us. He'll open a door for
[1:38:45] us. Where you work, where you live,
[1:38:47] where you shop, whatever it is, you
[1:38:50] young men and young women, what an
[1:38:53] opportunity you have. I wish I was your
[1:38:56] age again. I say, "Oh, with the
[1:38:58] songwriter, oh, for a thousand tongues,
[1:39:01] for a thousand lives, every opportunity
[1:39:04] I would have to live it for Christ."
[1:39:07] &gt;&gt; You say, "Well, you're up preaching."
[1:39:09] Don't forget I worked.
[1:39:11] &gt;&gt; I work for a living.
[1:39:13] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And I want to work and want
[1:39:15] to present myself as a Christian,
[1:39:18] &gt;&gt; a real Christian.
[1:39:20] &gt;&gt; Wherever we are, just be a real
[1:39:22] Christian.
[1:39:23] &gt;&gt; Be a real example of this message. Don't
[1:39:26] be interested in the world, young
[1:39:27] people. The world has nothing to offer
[1:39:30] you. Trouble, heartache, death.
[1:39:34] &gt;&gt; And I'm preaching today about him who
[1:39:37] was who was defeated at Calvary.
[1:39:40] &gt;&gt; And has no hold on your life.
[1:39:45] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:39:47] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:39:49] So brother Brand says, "So now
[1:39:53] we're at the end of an age."
[1:39:55] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:39:56] &gt;&gt; He said, "You see, you're at the end of
[1:39:58] an age here. There his ministry is
[1:40:01] ending."
[1:40:02] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:40:03] &gt;&gt; So was Brother Brener's ministry ending.
[1:40:05] This was coming to it's another
[1:40:07] fulfillment.
[1:40:08] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:40:09] &gt;&gt; His ministry was ending.
[1:40:12] So he says, "You're at the end of an age
[1:40:14] there. His ministry is ending. The
[1:40:16] hour's come. the son should be
[1:40:19] glorified.
[1:40:21] &gt;&gt; He breaks.
[1:40:23] He asks you this question.
[1:40:27] What about the hour has come
[1:40:30] &gt;&gt; when his bride must be taken away?
[1:40:35] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:40:35] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:40:37] &gt;&gt; Isn't that incredible?
[1:40:38] &gt;&gt; Amen. pulling it right out of the
[1:40:40] scripture
[1:40:42] &gt;&gt; just when Jesus is saying in John 14 and
[1:40:45] he's telling them now he he get he moves
[1:40:47] along further
[1:40:48] &gt;&gt; John 13 John 14 he says now uh uh I I'm
[1:40:54] I must leave it I must leave let not
[1:40:56] your heart be troubled neither let it be
[1:40:59] uh uh afraid said and I I'm I'm leaving
[1:41:03] I must I must leave but if I go away
[1:41:06] I'll come again
[1:41:07] &gt;&gt; and receive you under myself. There's
[1:41:10] the same same two things. He was leaving
[1:41:13] then, but he was going to come again to
[1:41:15] receive us to himself.
[1:41:17] &gt;&gt; He wasn't going to come down into
[1:41:19] Satan's Eden again. He came to Satan's
[1:41:22] Eden back then. And he gave his life
[1:41:24] then. This time he's coming in his
[1:41:27] dimension to take us from this dimension
[1:41:30] to that dimension.
[1:41:33] &gt;&gt; Are you with me?
[1:41:35] &gt;&gt; That where I am
[1:41:39] He's not here to die and suffer again
[1:41:42] where I am. He's in that other realm.
[1:41:45] &gt;&gt; And God sent you and I a messenger that
[1:41:49] stood here and constantly in that realm
[1:41:52] and had interchange with that realm,
[1:41:54] interaction with it to prove to you and
[1:41:57] I that's where we're going.
[1:42:03] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:42:05] Amen.
[1:42:09] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:42:13] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:42:15] &gt;&gt; What about the hour has come
[1:42:18] when his bride must be taken away?
[1:42:21] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:42:21] &gt;&gt; What that hour has come that time shall
[1:42:25] be no more. Not the clocks are going to
[1:42:26] stop.
[1:42:28] &gt;&gt; Amen. But they they'll call on God and
[1:42:30] call on God
[1:42:33] and not receive the answer
[1:42:36] that they have anticipated. There's no
[1:42:37] life coming back to respond to it.
[1:42:43] The same churches
[1:42:44] &gt;&gt; that have hard rock bands on the
[1:42:47] platform and men and women tattooed like
[1:42:51] devils and they read the same scriptures
[1:42:54] you read
[1:42:56] &gt;&gt; and expecting the same Lord Jesus
[1:42:58] Christ. I'm sorry friends. He's coming
[1:43:01] for a bride that's got the character of
[1:43:04] a bride that loves his word.
[1:43:09] And those that hear this kind of message
[1:43:11] and say, "I have no part of that." Then
[1:43:14] they're simply saying, "I have no part
[1:43:16] of him."
[1:43:19] &gt;&gt; Is this too hard?
[1:43:25] &gt;&gt; What about the hours come that time
[1:43:27] shall be no more?
[1:43:28] &gt;&gt; Is all the first seal. He's breaking
[1:43:31] into it.
[1:43:31] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:43:32] &gt;&gt; Setting the stage for it. The angel is
[1:43:35] ready to set one foot on the land and
[1:43:38] the other one on the sea with a rainbow
[1:43:41] over him with his feet and say, "Time's
[1:43:44] run out."
[1:43:47] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:43:48] &gt;&gt; And besides that, he raised up his hand
[1:43:51] and swore that it would be no more. And
[1:43:54] when that happened, how perfect it is. A
[1:43:57] sworn affidavit to the church.
[1:44:01] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:44:03] Now, it's a sworn affidavit.
[1:44:06] &gt;&gt; Here's what an affidavit is.
[1:44:09] &gt;&gt; It's a legal document.
[1:44:11] &gt;&gt; It's an affidavit.
[1:44:13] &gt;&gt; If you're going to swear something
[1:44:15] before a court of law, they will ask you
[1:44:18] to make an affidavit.
[1:44:20] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:44:20] &gt;&gt; This is what an affidavit is. It's a
[1:44:23] written declaration.
[1:44:24] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:44:26] &gt;&gt; Made on oath.
[1:44:28] &gt;&gt; You you give an oath. You can say,
[1:44:31] "Well, you know, my my word is good."
[1:44:35] Well, fine. That's fine, but let's make
[1:44:37] it a little stronger. Okay, I'll make
[1:44:39] you a promise. Okay, that's good, too.
[1:44:42] I'd like to make that a little stronger.
[1:44:44] Okay, I I will swear on it.
[1:44:47] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:44:48] &gt;&gt; Okay, but what are you what are you
[1:44:49] declaring? I will make an oath.
[1:44:53] &gt;&gt; I'll swear on an oath. Now you have
[1:44:57] double compounded it
[1:44:59] &gt;&gt; and an affidavit is made an oath.
[1:45:03] An oath before somebody
[1:45:07] &gt;&gt; authorized to administer oaths
[1:45:11] usually setting out the statement of a
[1:45:13] witness for court proceedings.
[1:45:16] &gt;&gt; Let me tell you friends, this one that's
[1:45:19] invisible to you and I became visible to
[1:45:22] this messenger.
[1:45:23] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. and told him, "Go to the
[1:45:26] people. This is my word and this is my
[1:45:29] oath
[1:45:31] &gt;&gt; and I will prove it.
[1:45:33] &gt;&gt; I will prove it. Though they can't see
[1:45:35] me,
[1:45:36] &gt;&gt; I will prove it. And you'll stand
[1:45:39] between this world and the next one.
[1:45:42] &gt;&gt; You'll stand between time and eternity."
[1:45:45] &gt;&gt; And you hear him say, "I'm in two
[1:45:47] worlds.
[1:45:48] &gt;&gt; I'm in two worlds." Have you heard him
[1:45:51] say that?
[1:45:52] &gt;&gt; That's where he is. between two worlds.
[1:45:55] I'm standing between two worlds. I'm
[1:45:57] standing in two worlds.
[1:46:01] &gt;&gt; Says one time, "These things are all
[1:46:02] available to you." He's talking to a
[1:46:05] woman right there in the platform. He
[1:46:06] said, "That pillar of fire you see a
[1:46:09] picture of that pillar of fire stands
[1:46:12] between I and the I and the woman."
[1:46:14] &gt;&gt; He said, "I am speaking through it."
[1:46:20] &gt;&gt; You talk about a filter, friends.
[1:46:23] You talk about a filter.
[1:46:25] &gt;&gt; Could anything go through the pillar of
[1:46:28] fire and be untrue on the other side?
[1:46:34] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:46:35] &gt;&gt; Help me out, friends.
[1:46:37] &gt;&gt; Help me out. I feel beside myself
[1:46:39] actually.
[1:46:41] &gt;&gt; Help me out.
[1:46:47] &gt;&gt; What a filter.
[1:46:50] &gt;&gt; What a filter.
[1:46:51] I'm speaking through that pure. See how
[1:46:54] close it was?
[1:46:56] &gt;&gt; I sat at a dinner table in brother
[1:46:59] Southwick's little campground
[1:47:02] home. We sat there from supper till late
[1:47:05] in the evening and the daylight still
[1:47:07] stays up north. You from the Yukon and
[1:47:10] up north, you know that it's daylight
[1:47:12] still maybe 10:00, 11:00 at night
[1:47:16] and further it stays daylight all night.
[1:47:20] That's in the summer
[1:47:23] and I'm sitting right beside brother
[1:47:25] Brandham
[1:47:26] and he's telling all the various
[1:47:28] accounts and brother brothers such south
[1:47:30] are there and their five sons were all
[1:47:33] there never heard these things in our
[1:47:34] lives
[1:47:36] mouths was open
[1:47:39] just with a baited breath
[1:47:42] waiting like for the next account of
[1:47:46] what happened in Finland when the boy
[1:47:47] was raised from the dead and what
[1:47:49] happened here? What happened there? And
[1:47:51] then he just jerked like this and put
[1:47:53] his finger up, looked at me, and he
[1:47:55] says, "Brother Eddie," he said, "That
[1:47:57] pillar of fire isn't 2 feet from any one
[1:48:00] of us at this moment."
[1:48:02] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:48:03] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:48:04] &gt;&gt; I didn't have to say, "Can you prove
[1:48:06] that?"
[1:48:07] &gt;&gt; What an atmosphere.
[1:48:09] &gt;&gt; What an atmosphere.
[1:48:11] &gt;&gt; Friends, it's as close as you want to
[1:48:13] believe it.
[1:48:15] Lo, I am with you always.
[1:48:20] Always.
[1:48:22] Hallelujah.
[1:48:24] Lo, I am with you always. Even to the
[1:48:28] end of the age.
[1:48:33] &gt;&gt; We dare to believe it.
[1:48:36] &gt;&gt; We dare to believe it, do we not?
[1:48:39] &gt;&gt; Anything can happen in this atmosphere.
[1:48:41] Anything can happen.
[1:48:44] Hallelujah.
[1:48:45] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. The resurrected Christ.
[1:48:56] &gt;&gt; Would you like to hear him say, "What
[1:48:58] would you have me to do?
[1:49:01] &gt;&gt; What would you have me to do for you?"
[1:49:04] And you'll find in the Bible this same
[1:49:07] Jesus. Every time he was asked,
[1:49:10] &gt;&gt; every time he was asked, he he gave it
[1:49:14] to them.
[1:49:16] &gt;&gt; Blindness, a leper, whatever it was,
[1:49:19] they received it.
[1:49:23] &gt;&gt; Lord, that I might have my sight.
[1:49:32] &gt;&gt; Oh, Fred, we got to go way beyond
[1:49:34] church.
[1:49:36] We got to go way beyond while I'm at
[1:49:38] church.
[1:49:39] &gt;&gt; What would you like him to do?
[1:49:49] &gt;&gt; So, we're right at the beginning
[1:49:54] and he goes on right after.
[1:49:58] He said, "The hour has come that the Son
[1:50:00] of Man should be glorified. Verily,
[1:50:01] verily, I say unto you, except a corn of
[1:50:05] wheat falls into the ground and dies, it
[1:50:07] abides alone. But if it die, it bringeth
[1:50:10] forth fruit.
[1:50:12] Father, glorify thy name. And then came
[1:50:15] a voice from heaven,
[1:50:18] saying, I have both glorified it, and
[1:50:20] will glorify it again.
[1:50:23] And the people said that stood by that
[1:50:25] heard it, they said it thundered. And
[1:50:29] when the lamb took the book and broke
[1:50:32] the first seal, God spoke from his
[1:50:35] eternal throne to say
[1:50:37] &gt;&gt; what was what that seal was to be
[1:50:40] revealed.
[1:50:42] &gt;&gt; And when it's placed there before John,
[1:50:45] it was a symbol. When John saw it, it
[1:50:49] was still a symbol. It was still a
[1:50:50] mystery. Why? It wasn't even revealed
[1:50:54] right then. Amen.
[1:50:56] &gt;&gt; It cannot be revealed until what he said
[1:50:59] here at the end time.
[1:51:02] &gt;&gt; He said, "But it came in a symbol." And
[1:51:04] notice the first seal when it was open
[1:51:07] in the symbol form back then it
[1:51:10] thundered. Now, what about when it's
[1:51:13] opened in the reality form? What was the
[1:51:16] reality form? Listen to me. The reality
[1:51:19] form was God's highest form of of of
[1:51:22] creation. a man with God in him speaking
[1:51:26] what the seal was and that was the
[1:51:30] thunder from God.
[1:51:35] &gt;&gt; Friends, the voice of God has been heard
[1:51:40] on the earth.
[1:51:41] &gt;&gt; How can we say that? Because he proved
[1:51:43] it. He proved it. You don't have to
[1:51:46] believe it, but he proved it.
[1:51:48] &gt;&gt; Take any message. Take identification.
[1:51:51] Take we would see Jesus. Show us the
[1:51:53] father. Take any message and he'll prove
[1:51:56] it to you.
[1:52:06] &gt;&gt; Blessed are you, Lord Jesus.
[1:52:08] &gt;&gt; And notice the first seal when it was
[1:52:09] opened now in reality form. He said,
[1:52:12] "The lamb's blood paid the price.
[1:52:16] &gt;&gt; It thundered when he spoke it out. And
[1:52:18] when he did, a white horse rider started
[1:52:21] out and it still was a symbol
[1:52:25] &gt;&gt; because we didn't know what the white
[1:52:26] horse rider and I have read theologians
[1:52:29] said it was the Holy Ghost.
[1:52:32] &gt;&gt; And the prophet comes who has been
[1:52:34] proven says it's the devil.
[1:52:38] &gt;&gt; How can you get further away from the
[1:52:40] Holy Ghost? Who do you want to hear? The
[1:52:43] Holy Ghost and no proof or it's the
[1:52:45] devil and God proves it.
[1:52:49] Hallelujah.
[1:52:55] &gt;&gt; He said, "Now watch." He said, "It would
[1:52:57] be known in the last day.
[1:53:00] &gt;&gt; But it comes forth. It comes forth in a
[1:53:02] church symbol.
[1:53:04] &gt;&gt; Do you understand it, church? It comes
[1:53:06] forth in a symbol of a church that they
[1:53:09] know there is a seal. That's what they
[1:53:12] know. But just what it is yet, they
[1:53:15] don't know because it's a white horse
[1:53:17] rider.
[1:53:18] &gt;&gt; It's a white horse rider. He's just
[1:53:20] coming to it. Are you with me, friends?
[1:53:23] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:53:23] &gt;&gt; This is the beginning of the first seal.
[1:53:25] And now the seal's going to be broken.
[1:53:28] &gt;&gt; And we'll know it's not just a symbol.
[1:53:30] It's not just a white horse rider. It's
[1:53:32] the devil
[1:53:34] &gt;&gt; riding in with deception.
[1:53:37] &gt;&gt; And he rode in with persecution.
[1:53:40] &gt;&gt; He rode in with blood and suffering. He
[1:53:42] rode in with famine.
[1:53:44] &gt;&gt; He rode in with darkness in the dark
[1:53:46] ages.
[1:53:47] &gt;&gt; And then end time, he rides in with a a
[1:53:50] a a kind of a gray horse, pale horse.
[1:53:57] &gt;&gt; And if you take that word in the Greek,
[1:53:59] it says it's a it's a blood disease.
[1:54:03] &gt;&gt; This generation's got a blood disease.
[1:54:07] &gt;&gt; And it isn't cancer.
[1:54:09] &gt;&gt; It's that they don't have the blood of
[1:54:10] Jesus Christ. Hallelujah. And you have
[1:54:14] had a blood transfusion. Hallelujah.
[1:54:17] &gt;&gt; For that blood produced this word.
[1:54:20] &gt;&gt; And you believe this word. You've had a
[1:54:22] new birth.
[1:54:26] &gt;&gt; You've had a blood transfusion.
[1:54:31] &gt;&gt; The cell of God was broken
[1:54:34] &gt;&gt; to bring forth this word
[1:54:37] &gt;&gt; at this time.
[1:54:41] The actual seal is broken.
[1:54:44] &gt;&gt; Broken to who? Not Christ, but to the
[1:54:47] church. I hope the church truly
[1:54:48] understands it. You people, I'm going to
[1:54:51] call you bride.
[1:54:54] &gt;&gt; That's now first time. I'm not going to
[1:54:55] call you church anymore. Isn't it
[1:54:58] wonderful to have Elijah says, "I'll
[1:54:59] call you bride."
[1:55:02] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen.
[1:55:05] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:55:07] &gt;&gt; Revelation 5 and9 says
[1:55:10] &gt;&gt; the fifth chapter. It's when the lamb
[1:55:13] took the seals and you can read it when
[1:55:15] you go home. And they sung a new song.
[1:55:18] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:55:20] &gt;&gt; They've never sung this song before. And
[1:55:22] they sung a new song. And thou art
[1:55:25] worthy to take the book.
[1:55:28] &gt;&gt; What is this? This is a glorious
[1:55:30] victory.
[1:55:31] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. over the enemy's defeat.
[1:55:35] This is not the battle of Stalin Grod.
[1:55:38] This is not the battle of Trfalgar. This
[1:55:40] is not the second world war. This is not
[1:55:43] V day when men died. This is the day
[1:55:46] that one man died.
[1:55:51] This is the day that man rose from the
[1:55:53] dead and said to you and to me, "Behold,
[1:55:57] I live. And because I live, you shall
[1:56:01] live also.
[1:56:09] &gt;&gt; And that is why they sung a new song.
[1:56:13] &gt;&gt; They sung a new song. Thou art worthy.
[1:56:16] &gt;&gt; You're worthy to take the book
[1:56:19] &gt;&gt; and to open the seals thereof.
[1:56:21] &gt;&gt; Why?
[1:56:23] &gt;&gt; For thou was slain. Amen.
[1:56:27] &gt;&gt; This is part of your victory.
[1:56:31] &gt;&gt; Because you died, you can take the book.
[1:56:37] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:56:39] &gt;&gt; Listen, folks.
[1:56:42] &gt;&gt; Your name
[1:56:44] was in that book.
[1:56:49] &gt;&gt; You plan to go to heaven.
[1:56:52] &gt;&gt; Every person plan to go to heaven. You
[1:56:54] young people plan to go to heaven. If
[1:56:57] you really believe that, your name had
[1:56:58] to be in that book. And he had to die to
[1:57:01] take the book.
[1:57:03] &gt;&gt; If he didn't die, you could never get
[1:57:05] there. He died to take the book. You're
[1:57:08] worthy. Glory. Glory. Glory. Because you
[1:57:13] were slain.
[1:57:20] &gt;&gt; Because he died. You talk about a
[1:57:22] victory march.
[1:57:25] &gt;&gt; You're a people that can have a victory
[1:57:26] march.
[1:57:28] &gt;&gt; Go home and have the victory march.
[1:57:30] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:57:32] Every promise in that book is mine. He
[1:57:35] has purchased it. He paid for it. And I
[1:57:38] will not give the devil any
[1:57:42] &gt;&gt; glory whatsoever.
[1:57:52] I'm closing in just a few minutes.
[1:57:57] &gt;&gt; You know what? One of our big problems
[1:57:58] is
[1:58:00] ours. I said because it's mine also.
[1:58:05] We look at symptoms.
[1:58:09] &gt;&gt; The world is full of symptoms.
[1:58:12] &gt;&gt; I see the symptoms of judgment
[1:58:15] &gt;&gt; everywhere.
[1:58:16] I see the symptoms of insanity.
[1:58:20] &gt;&gt; I say it every day. Every day to my
[1:58:22] wife, the world's crazy.
[1:58:25] &gt;&gt; True.
[1:58:25] &gt;&gt; They're crazy.
[1:58:27] &gt;&gt; This world's insane.
[1:58:30] &gt;&gt; Is that supposed to be music?
[1:58:33] &gt;&gt; That's insane.
[1:58:35] &gt;&gt; I don't know if you've done it. I've
[1:58:36] turned on the radio. I try to hear the
[1:58:38] news. We never have the radio on our
[1:58:40] home, but I like to get the news. I like
[1:58:41] to get the weather once in a while. like
[1:58:43] to my wife likes the weather and I try
[1:58:44] to find what the traffic's doing. So,
[1:58:46] we're a good team.
[1:58:49] She said, "Don't shut that off. It's
[1:58:50] just coming to the weather now." Oh,
[1:58:52] okay.
[1:58:53] And I tell her, "It's just going to tell
[1:58:56] us what's happening with the traffic. I
[1:58:57] want to know what's happening at the
[1:58:58] border." This was yesterday.
[1:59:01] So, we make a good team,
[1:59:05] but I say all the time. Then it comes on
[1:59:08] and then the background is boom boom
[1:59:10] boom boom boom boom and I can barely
[1:59:13] hear the guy's voice. I'm listening with
[1:59:15] all what did he say?
[1:59:19] Boom boom boom boom. Why don't they shut
[1:59:22] that off so I can hear the man's voice
[1:59:24] and hear what the weather says. And I go
[1:59:27] into going to eat. Go you go into your
[1:59:29] favorite restaurant. What you'll hear is
[1:59:31] kaboom tick kaboom tickity tickity. No
[1:59:35] music. Just like we we we've got to, you
[1:59:37] know, eat to the beat or something.
[1:59:41] It's wild.
[1:59:43] &gt;&gt; It's insane.
[1:59:44] &gt;&gt; Symptoms of insanity everywhere.
[1:59:48] &gt;&gt; You kids, you got it in your school.
[1:59:50] &gt;&gt; If you're in the wrong school,
[1:59:54] &gt;&gt; but you've got it there. You've got it
[1:59:56] on the streets. You've got it
[1:59:57] everywhere.
[1:59:59] I walked into a restaurant here some
[2:00:02] days ago and there was mom and dad and a
[2:00:06] girl. She was about 12 or 14. Guess what
[2:00:10] they were doing? Anybody got an idea?
[2:00:14] &gt;&gt; What were they doing?
[2:00:16] &gt;&gt; You're scared to say it.
[2:00:19] They were all busy texting,
[2:00:24] adjusting the buds,
[2:00:26] listening. never said one word to each
[2:00:29] other.
[2:00:31] &gt;&gt; They might as well gone to three
[2:00:32] different restaurants.
[2:00:38] &gt;&gt; I get worried driving down the street
[2:00:40] like I'm going to hit somebody cuz they
[2:00:41] they got those things in their ears and
[2:00:43] they're going to step off the sidewalk
[2:00:45] &gt;&gt; cuz they got control of the world.
[2:00:48] &gt;&gt; You know what? Don't forget it. This is
[2:00:52] Satan's Eden.
[2:00:54] And Satan, this devil, this devil, he
[2:00:57] got into God's Eden, crept under the
[2:00:59] garden walls, and polluted the bride.
[2:01:03] &gt;&gt; Jesus came down in Satan's Eden and took
[2:01:05] his bride and made her a virgin.
[2:01:12] Not a forgiven woman, a virgin woman.
[2:01:15] and thus sent a messenger that to make a
[2:01:18] statement that most people have a hard
[2:01:20] time with, you never did it in the first
[2:01:23] place.
[2:01:25] That word turns people back to
[2:01:28] virginity.
[2:01:30] That was William Brandon. William
[2:01:32] Brandon couldn't say that. That had to
[2:01:35] be God himself.
[2:01:41] &gt;&gt; You got things in your life you're
[2:01:42] ashamed of. They're gone. You got things
[2:01:46] you're sorry about, they're gone. You
[2:01:48] got mistakes that made, they're gone. I
[2:01:51] can say that on the authority of this
[2:01:53] spoken word where the seal has been
[2:01:56] opened. You've got sins that Satan will
[2:01:58] stuff down your memory. They're gone.
[2:02:03] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:02:05] &gt;&gt; They're gone.
[2:02:09] &gt;&gt; It's already done.
[2:02:12] &gt;&gt; It's been spoken. It's already done.
[2:02:16] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:02:20] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:02:22] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:02:25] &gt;&gt; I just have to say what he said. Oh,
[2:02:27] what a message.
[2:02:29] &gt;&gt; Oh, what a message.
[2:02:33] &gt;&gt; And it's true, friends.
[2:02:35] &gt;&gt; It's true.
[2:02:36] &gt;&gt; I feel like I'd like to sing. Brother
[2:02:39] Ryan, if you'll come up here and folks
[2:02:42] get ready. I'd like to sing. Years I
[2:02:45] spent in vanity and pride,
[2:02:48] &gt;&gt; caring not my Lord was crucified.
[2:02:52] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:02:54] &gt;&gt; And then he came. Aren't you glad?
[2:02:57] &gt;&gt; Isn't that wonderful news, friends?
[2:03:00] &gt;&gt; It's wonderful news.
[2:03:02] &gt;&gt; It's right at the opening of the seal
[2:03:04] &gt;&gt; and it thundered. It was a thunder. And
[2:03:07] what will it be when the bride shall be
[2:03:10] taken?
[2:03:13] &gt;&gt; You may be weary of waiting. Don't
[2:03:15] weary.
[2:03:17] &gt;&gt; Don't be tired.
[2:03:19] &gt;&gt; We're living right in that hour.
[2:03:24] &gt;&gt; If it's today, wonderful. If it's not,
[2:03:26] we got more opportunity to serve him.
[2:03:29] &gt;&gt; What a glorious message you have.
[2:03:34] &gt;&gt; God bless you.
[2:03:35] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:03:38] Well,
[2:03:44] &gt;&gt; is there more of a fourth part? Maybe.
[2:03:48] &gt;&gt; I got on page three
[2:03:50] &gt;&gt; and I thought I'm going to be a nice boy
[2:03:52] today. I'm just going to stand here and
[2:03:53] be quiet.
[2:03:55] I'm just going to speak and just, you
[2:03:57] know, say it so everybody can hear it
[2:03:59] and understand it. But friends, just
[2:04:02] forgive me. I I just got to
[2:04:12] Hallelujah.
[2:04:20] I wanted so bad. I wanted so much to dig
[2:04:24] it into the devil.
[2:04:27] I saw ourselves marching.
[2:04:30] Hallelujah.
[2:04:32] Giving him glory
[2:04:35] over the defeat of our enemy.
[2:04:39] Hallelujah.
[2:04:40] Hallelujah.
[2:04:43] Lord bless you
[2:04:46] in the name of Jesus Christ. Let's stand
[2:04:49] and sing it together. You don't have to
[2:04:52] clap even though it is a happy song, but
[2:04:55] just as you want to rejoice, it's fine.
[2:04:59] Heat. Heat. Heat.
[2:05:09] Oh my god.
[2:05:39] Oh,
[2:05:55] heat,
[2:06:04] heat.
[2:06:06] Heat.
[2:06:17] Heat.
[2:06:26] Heat
[2:06:31] up
[2:06:38] here.
[2:06:51] Yeah.
[2:07:09] Heat.
[2:07:36] Heat. Heat.
[2:07:40] Very
[2:07:56] long ago here in this city, the city
[2:07:58] disgraced its name by bunch of hoodlams,
[2:08:02] tens of thousands of them on the street.
[2:08:05] Not in a victory march because the
[2:08:07] Canucks didn't get to win the game. Oh
[2:08:10] my. Burning up cars, smashing doors, uh
[2:08:15] smashing windows, all kinds of nonsense.
[2:08:18] And we got a name around the world as
[2:08:20] being bad. But there's a name, there's a
[2:08:23] name of a people, I'll call you bride.
[2:08:26] &gt;&gt; Elijah said, "I'll call you bride."
[2:08:29] &gt;&gt; I can see that one beyond the curtain of
[2:08:31] time saying to him, "Call him bride.
[2:08:35] &gt;&gt; Don't call him church anymore. Call him
[2:08:38] bride.
[2:08:41] They throw their hats in the air and do
[2:08:43] all kinds of things. You can clap your
[2:08:45] hands if you want. That might be a
[2:08:46] tradition. I'm going to wave my
[2:08:48] handkerchief. Wave your Bible. Do
[2:08:50] whatever you want to do.
[2:08:55] &gt;&gt; I'm going to ask brother Oed to come up
[2:08:57] and say a prayer here before we close.
[2:09:00] But we're going to sing before you pray,
[2:09:02] brother Oed. Is that all right? Good.
[2:09:05] We're going to do it anyway.
[2:09:08] Oh, the mighty golf that God did. That
[2:09:10] the last verse. The last verse. Oh. Oh,
[2:09:13] the love that drew salvation's plan.
[2:09:25] Yeah.
[2:09:30] Heat.
[2:09:48] Yeah.
[2:09:59] Heat.
[2:10:22] There may be somebody here saying, "I
[2:10:25] wish I could sing it like that. I wish I
[2:10:28] had freedom. I've been walking the wrong
[2:10:31] direction. I've been doing the wrong
[2:10:34] things." You know how long it ch takes
[2:10:36] to change that? just this minute.
[2:10:40] &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham had people right in
[2:10:41] front of him. This is this message now.
[2:10:43] And they couldn't pray for them. It
[2:10:45] couldn't be healing. And he would say to
[2:10:46] them, "Do you receive the Lord Jesus
[2:10:48] Christ as your personal savior?" They he
[2:10:50] said, "I do. God bless you." And pray
[2:10:53] for him right then.
[2:10:55] &gt;&gt; That's how long it takes.
[2:10:58] &gt;&gt; In a moment,
[2:10:59] &gt;&gt; don't go out of this place in this
[2:11:02] moment.
[2:11:03] &gt;&gt; Say, "God, I receive your word.
[2:11:08] Mercy there was great
[2:11:11] mercy
[2:11:13] there great
[2:11:56] When the redeemed, I got to sing a verse
[2:11:59] or two. when the redeemed are gathering
[2:12:01] in.
[2:12:02] &gt;&gt; Oh, they tell me,
[2:12:05] &gt;&gt; "Glory to God."
[2:12:07] &gt;&gt; I'm not doing this for you folks. I'm
[2:12:09] doing it for myself.
[2:12:10] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:12:12] When I get out out of here, I won't have
[2:12:14] the same kind of opportunity to rejoice.
[2:12:16] I'm rejoicing together with you.
[2:12:18] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:12:24] &gt;&gt; I am thinking
[2:12:26] started off.
[2:12:29] and thinking of a rap.
[2:12:56] Yeah. Heat.
[2:13:15] I'll have you just wait a moment.
[2:13:20] Remember, he said just like a child, if
[2:13:23] there's been an affliction,
[2:13:25] if there's been an affliction,
[2:13:28] here's a prophet. See it no more. Amen.
[2:13:32] &gt;&gt; If there's been a disease,
[2:13:35] &gt;&gt; it's there no more.
[2:13:37] &gt;&gt; Just ignore any symbols
[2:13:41] &gt;&gt; or symptoms.
[2:13:45] &gt;&gt; Anything that's contrary to what's been
[2:13:47] asked.
[2:13:48] &gt;&gt; Every child that comes to God's got to
[2:13:51] be tried. And we're tried to see if we
[2:13:54] believe it or not. and you'll have wars
[2:13:57] and troubles, but remember we're on our
[2:14:00] march.
[2:14:02] &gt;&gt; He said, "Ignore the symptoms."
[2:14:06] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:14:08] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:14:11] &gt;&gt; They throw their aprons in the air. He
[2:14:14] say, "Long as you look at the symptoms,
[2:14:16] you're not going to see nothing else but
[2:14:19] your symptoms. It depends on what you're
[2:14:21] looking at." Amen.
[2:14:23] &gt;&gt; What I'm looking at right now, friends,
[2:14:24] I said to God all through my studies
[2:14:26] this last week, I said, "Give me the
[2:14:29] eyes of faith.
[2:14:31] &gt;&gt; Father, I want to see what you're
[2:14:32] looking at.
[2:14:34] &gt;&gt; I want to see what's in your mind."
[2:14:36] &gt;&gt; And so, this little tidbit that we have
[2:14:38] this morning is what is in his mind.
[2:14:41] &gt;&gt; Then I begin to think of the great the
[2:14:43] great crisis, the great moment, the
[2:14:46] great victory. And since then, since I
[2:14:49] saw the glories of the battle and the
[2:14:51] glories of the victory that's go out of
[2:14:54] this place, friends, don't forget it.
[2:14:57] When you leave this place, say, "I'm
[2:14:59] rejoicing.
[2:15:00] &gt;&gt; I'm not at the Ark of Triumph. I'm not
[2:15:02] at some other place. I'm not at some war
[2:15:04] victory. I'm not at some game.
[2:15:08] &gt;&gt; We're in the race of our lives."
[2:15:13] &gt;&gt; And what we're singing about is going to
[2:15:15] be exactly that way. Amen.
[2:15:17] &gt;&gt; I want to be there.
[2:15:19] &gt;&gt; I want to be with you folks.
[2:15:21] &gt;&gt; I want to march in
[2:15:22] &gt;&gt; when the saints are marching in.
[2:15:25] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. There'll be a table spread.
[2:15:27] You believe it, friends?
[2:15:30] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. God bless you.
[2:15:32] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:15:34] &gt;&gt; When you said, "I believe it."
[2:15:36] &gt;&gt; God bless you.
[2:15:37] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:15:38] &gt;&gt; I take that exactly as a man or the
[2:15:40] woman standing in front of the
[2:15:41] messenger.
[2:15:42] &gt;&gt; Do you believe that?
[2:15:44] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:15:46] possible it is
[2:15:48] man crying Jesus saying what would you
[2:15:52] have me do unto you
[2:15:56] it's not complicated
[2:15:58] what would you have me do for you
[2:16:02] that I might receive my sight
[2:16:06] give it to him
[2:16:08] &gt;&gt; you know what friends I just I am so
[2:16:12] gripped to preach faith to you
[2:16:14] &gt;&gt; until what you're calling for and what
[2:16:16] you're desiring comes about.
[2:16:19] &gt;&gt; This word has promised it.
[2:16:22] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:16:23] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:16:24] &gt;&gt; God bless you, brother Matthew. Sister
[2:16:26] Geneva, thought of you much. Hallelujah.
[2:16:28] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:16:29] &gt;&gt; You got to realize we're ignoring the
[2:16:32] symptoms.
[2:16:33] &gt;&gt; I don't care where the symptoms are.
[2:16:35] We're ignoring them. It's part of this
[2:16:37] world, part of this devil's kingdom. And
[2:16:40] that's why our Christ was on Calvary
[2:16:43] &gt;&gt; so that I could preach to you this
[2:16:44] morning and say, "Look to the cross.
[2:16:47] &gt;&gt; Look to the lamb of God."
[2:16:52] &gt;&gt; Glory, glory, glory. Let's sing one more
[2:16:54] verse and then
[2:17:00] then the Savior will give orders. He's
[2:17:02] already given the orders. Then the
[2:17:05] Savior will give orders.
[2:17:08] Heat. Heat.
[2:17:37] Heat.
[2:17:46] Heat.
[2:17:49] down.
[2:17:51] Heat. Heat. Heat.
[2:18:01] Heat. Heat.
[2:18:14] Hallelujah.
[2:18:19] Brother John Andy is going to be
[2:18:20] ministering tonight.
[2:18:23] I trust that you just got now come in
[2:18:25] that same atmosphere. Come with the same
[2:18:27] expectation. Brother Oed, welcome home.
[2:18:32] &gt;&gt; You agree?
[2:18:34] &gt;&gt; Welcome home.
[2:18:35] &gt;&gt; Our lost son has returned.
[2:18:40] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Praise the Lord.
[2:18:43] God bless you, brother Old.
[2:18:45] &gt;&gt; Well, I just want to give you greetings
[2:18:47] from uh our pastor, brother Herold. And
[2:18:51] uh he sent his greetings to the pastor
[2:18:53] and brother John.
[2:18:54] &gt;&gt; Thank you.
[2:18:55] &gt;&gt; It's been a while. We He also called
[2:18:57] brother John his lost son. So I don't
[2:19:00] know who's lost where.
[2:19:04] Right. Let's pray. Our Lord Jesus,
[2:19:09] what a privilege this morning
[2:19:13] &gt;&gt; to hear the message of this day,
[2:19:17] &gt;&gt; Lord God,
[2:19:19] &gt;&gt; as it just stuck with me as the prophet
[2:19:22] said, "Oh, what a message."
[2:19:27] &gt;&gt; Lord Jesus,
[2:19:29] we come to you this morning just to
[2:19:32] thank you, Father, for opening our eyes.
[2:19:36] As the prophet says, we are living in a
[2:19:39] time where people are being blinded.
[2:19:42] But there is a bride of Jesus Christ
[2:19:45] that has her eyes open to see the
[2:19:49] mystery being unfolded before us.
[2:19:52] &gt;&gt; Lord, we are so privileged this morning
[2:19:54] to hear the word of God himself speaking
[2:19:58] through the prophet of today. Amen.
[2:20:02] &gt;&gt; Lord God, there is no much we can say
[2:20:04] but just to give you praise,
[2:20:07] &gt;&gt; to give you honor, to glorify your holy
[2:20:10] name, glory
[2:20:11] &gt;&gt; for what you have done for us today to
[2:20:14] call us the bride of Jesus Christ.
