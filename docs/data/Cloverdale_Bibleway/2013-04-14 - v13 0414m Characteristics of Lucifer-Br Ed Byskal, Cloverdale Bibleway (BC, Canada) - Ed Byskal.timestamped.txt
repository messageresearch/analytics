[0:03] [Music]
[0:40] Savior
[0:42] is Jesus my Lord.
[0:46] A wonderful
[0:49] Savior
[0:51] to me.
[0:54] For he hideth
[0:57] my soul in the depth of a rock where
[1:04] rivers
[1:05] of pleasure I see. He hideth my soul. He
[1:12] hideth my soul
[1:16] in the cliff of the rock that shadows
[1:22] a dry thirsty
[1:25] land.
[1:27] Oh, where he hideth my life
[1:32] in the depths of his love
[1:37] and covers me there with his hand
[1:45] and covers
[1:48] me there
[1:50] with his hand.
[1:52] Verse two, a wonderful
[1:56] Savior
[1:58] is Jesus
[2:00] my Lord.
[2:02] Oh, he taketh
[2:04] my burden away.
[2:10] Oh, he holdeth
[2:13] me up and I shall not be moved.
[2:19] He giveth me strength as my day.
[2:26] Oh, he hide in my soul
[2:31] in the cl
[2:34] of the rock
[2:36] that shadow
[2:38] [Music]
[2:39] thirsty.
[2:41] [Music]
[2:43] When he hideth my life
[2:48] in the deck
[2:51] with love
[2:53] and covers me there with his hand.
[3:01] When covers me there
[3:05] with his hand with numberless blessings
[3:10] with numberless
[3:12] blessings
[3:14] each
[3:17] crown
[3:18] and fil with his fullness
[3:22] divine.
[3:26] I sing
[3:28] in my rapture.
[3:30] Oh, glory to God.
[3:34] For such
[3:36] a redeemer
[3:39] as mine,
[3:42] for he hide in my soul.
[3:49] Oh, of the rock
[3:51] that shall
[3:54] dry thirsty
[3:57] land
[3:59] where he hid.
[4:03] Oh, in the depths of his hand
[4:08] and covers me there with his hand.
[4:15] Oh, when he covers
[4:19] [Music]
[4:21] with his hand. Oh, let's sing the fourth
[4:23] verse. When clothed in his brightness,
[4:25] when clothed in his brightness,
[4:30] transported
[4:32] I rise
[4:34] to
[4:36] him in clouds of the sky.
[4:40] Oh, his perfect salvation. His perfect
[4:44] salvation,
[4:46] his wonderful
[4:49] love.
[4:50] I'll shout
[4:52] with the millions on high
[4:59] behind
[5:14] [Music]
[5:18] my life in the depth of his love and
[5:24] covers
[5:26] me there with his hand
[5:33] and covers
[5:35] me there.
[5:37] With his hand.
[5:41] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Only you, Lord.
[5:45] Only you. Blessed be the Lord.

[8:22] hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[8:25] Amen. I'm going to ask maybe the
[8:28] brothers can prepare for the morning
[8:29] offering as we're just going to prepare
[8:30] to go to prayer also as we want to sing
[8:33] onlyly believe. Sister Linda, we have
[8:35] quite a few prayer requests this
[8:36] morning. Amen. I'm not going to read all
[8:40] of them, but we do just want to mention
[8:42] the names before you and ask that God
[8:44] would just move on their behalf. Our
[8:46] sister Rebecca Hegman has a silent
[8:48] prayer request. Our brother Levi Drake
[8:50] needs healing. Brother Sam and Sister
[8:52] Renie also asking that the Lord would
[8:54] grant them a healing touch. Amen. And
[8:56] our sister Sylvia is asking we'd
[8:57] remember her mother, Mother Sergeya for
[9:00] a friend, Sister Grace going into
[9:01] surgery and her prayer request for
[9:03] Sister Dorothy McGowan. There's many
[9:05] needs. Amen. There's needs in our
[9:07] bodies, needs in our hearts and our
[9:09] families. Amen. So, why don't we just
[9:11] sing onlyly believe, only believe all
[9:13] things are possible. Amen. I'm going to
[9:15] ask that our brother John Andy's would
[9:17] just come and lay his hands on these
[9:18] requests and remember them before the
[9:20] Lord.
[9:23] Only believe. Amen. Brother Brand said
[9:25] the angel of the Lord loved this song
[9:26] and I believe he's here this morning to
[9:28] meet our needs. Amen. So why don't we
[9:29] sing this as we prepare our hearts to go
[9:32] to prayer.
[9:34] Only
[9:36] believe.
[9:41] Only
[9:43] believe
[9:46] that all things
[9:49] are possible.
[9:53] Holy
[9:56] be.
[9:58] [Music]
[10:11] All things are possible.
[10:17] Holy. Why don't you just hold something
[10:20] in your heart now as you sing, "Lord, I
[10:22] believe. Lord,
[10:25] I believe." Just lay it at his feet this
[10:28] morning. Lord,
[10:31] I believe.
[10:35] For all things
[10:37] are possible.
[10:40] And Lord I
[10:43] believe,
[10:46] Lord
[10:48] I believe.
[10:50] [Music]
[10:52] Lord
[10:54] I believe.
[10:58] For all things are possible.
[11:06] [Music]
[11:08] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah Lord. Hallelujah, Lord.
[11:11] Hallelujah, Lord. We want to come with
[11:14] thanksgiving in our hearts, praisees on
[11:16] our lips, Lord, that the very water,
[11:20] Lord, that we're anointing, Lord, this
[11:22] word with this morning, it's going to
[11:24] carry us into a body change. So, as an
[11:27] assembly, Lord, we just want to approach
[11:28] you with thanksgiving, with a giving,
[11:31] Lord, pouring out of ourselves. We want
[11:34] to be willing, Lord, to lay it all down,
[11:36] God, and praise you and worship you.
[11:38] Recognize your presence among us, Lord.
[11:41] Recognize your word that has brought us
[11:43] to such a time as this, Lord. Recognize
[11:47] the angels that are lying in these
[11:48] walls, Lord. Recognizing the redeemed
[11:51] that's standing next to us, Lord.
[11:54] Recognizing your word that's been broken
[11:56] for us. Oh, angel of the Lord, lead us,
[11:59] Lord, through this nighttime, Lord. the
[12:02] pillar of cloud by day and the fire by
[12:05] night. Lord, we believe your
[12:06] supernatural is all around us. We
[12:09] believe you've come inside of us now as
[12:11] a people and you're looking to our
[12:13] words. You're looking to our confession.
[12:16] You're looking to our faith now. We've
[12:18] moved into another channel. We've moved
[12:20] into another bracket. There's been
[12:22] another people rise up on the face of
[12:24] the earth who your word is now within
[12:27] their lips. You're within their heart.
[12:30] She knows what you want done with the
[12:32] word. We're approaching you with that
[12:34] revelation, not of an elementary infant
[12:37] faith, but a wife who's making herself
[12:40] ready, bursting, Lord, under
[12:42] anticipation for the pregnancy that
[12:45] we've endured for these 50 years now.
[12:48] That it would bring forth a rapture.
[12:50] That it would bring forth a redeem,
[12:52] Lord, through the womb of our souls.
[12:55] We're asking for revelation today, God,
[12:58] that you would just blanket this whole
[13:00] address and this property, especially
[13:03] the sanctuary with your divine presence.
[13:07] Take control of the nursery, the
[13:08] fellowship hall out over the internet.
[13:11] Lord, we pray that your third pull would
[13:14] move within the hearts of a people. Our
[13:17] hearts are beating with anticipation.
[13:20] We're expecting, Lord, a move of the
[13:21] Holy Ghost. Even today we believe as a
[13:25] special day. Our hearts, Lord, have been
[13:27] primed for a word, Lord. A change. As
[13:31] eagles, we feed off of you, Lord. We're
[13:33] asking your presence, God, would take
[13:36] control of the vessel that you've
[13:38] provided for us through our pastor. And
[13:41] Lord, may he feel such a liberty to
[13:44] speak under that divine channel. The
[13:46] Holy Ghost would minister to every life
[13:48] that's here. We trust you. We have
[13:51] confidence in you, Lord. We're laying
[13:53] hands on all of these prayer requests,
[13:55] this prayer clause. Lord, there's
[13:57] unspoken requests. My hands are lifted
[14:00] up, Lord. Hands are lifted up throughout
[14:02] the world. We're looking unto Jesus, the
[14:05] author and finisher of our faith.
[14:10] Heavenly Father, you are the one that
[14:12] has trumpeted out this message that this
[14:15] is our Jubilee time and everyone can go
[14:19] free. You've delivered a word for our
[14:21] souls. You brought us into your very
[14:24] heart, God. Our spirits, Lord, are
[14:26] brought into a rapturing change. Lord,
[14:30] our bodies, Lord, are being healed.
[14:32] You're doing miracles, Lord. Even this
[14:34] past week, Lord, you've done miracles
[14:36] for some in our congregation and many
[14:39] throughout the land of the bride. And
[14:41] these prayer requests are great, and
[14:43] they are many. Would you minister to our
[14:45] families, minister to these individual
[14:48] hearts, God? break out upon us, Lord,
[14:50] with your divine hand as the water and
[14:54] the blood flow from your side. May the
[14:57] Holy Spirit be unleashed, Lord, in
[15:00] divine healings and miracles,
[15:02] deliverances.
[15:07] We're silent, Lord, in your presence,
[15:10] but there's a great opening that's
[15:12] happened. Our hearts are just pulsating
[15:16] with that divine anticipation of the
[15:19] move of the Holy Ghost. Bless the
[15:21] morning service. Bless this offering. We
[15:24] dedicate it to you. Everyone that gives,
[15:27] those that cannot give, may you multiply
[15:29] it for your kingdom in Jesus name. Amen.
[15:35] Amen.
[15:40] Glory.

[17:27] and everyone in the name of our Lord
[17:28] Jesus. We're happy to have you here with
[17:29] us this morning. And I'm going to ask
[17:31] our sister Natasha if she would just
[17:33] come. She has a special for us. There's
[17:36] a couple testimonies that we also wanted
[17:38] to share. Our brother Quibbus wants to
[17:39] give all the glory to the Lord. He says,
[17:41] "A back it felt as if I was losing my
[17:43] sense of hearing in my right ear. And
[17:44] after the service, Brother John prayed
[17:46] for me. And the very next morning early,
[17:48] my right ear came open and is still
[17:49] open. Thank you, Jesus." Amen. And also
[17:53] a note of thanks from our sister
[17:54] Leverne. I want to give God all the
[17:56] honor, glory, and praise for he is
[17:58] worthy. Stanley, my son, is recovering
[18:00] speedily and is in rehab and working
[18:02] very hard to learn how to get around
[18:03] without part of his right leg and foot.
[18:05] But all is well. I thank everyone for
[18:07] praying for me and my family. God bless
[18:09] all. I am so thankful for the family of
[18:11] God. All my love, Sister Leverne
[18:13] Clemens. God bless you, Sister Leverne.
[18:15] Amen. We want to remember the prayer
[18:16] meeting this Friday also here at the
[18:18] church at 7:30.
[18:20] Amen. We'll turn to the word after
[18:22] Sister Natasha sings. Amen. May God
[18:24] bless you, sister Natasha.
[18:28] [Music]
[18:39] I know you're going through the fire.
[18:45] It's getting hard to stand the heat.
[18:51] But even harder is the wondering
[18:57] is God's hand still on me.
[19:04] [Music]
[19:05] It's lonely in the flames when you're
[19:09] counting days of pain.
[19:13] But the potter knows the clay,
[19:18] how much pressure it can take,
[19:24] how many times around the week
[19:30] till their submission to his will.
[19:36] He's planned a beautiful design,
[19:42] but it will take some fire and time.
[19:49] It's going to be okay.
[19:55] Cuz the potter knows the clay.
[20:00] [Music]
[20:04] friend. I just came through that fire
[20:07] [Music]
[20:10] not too long ago.
[20:15] And looking back, I can't see why.
[20:21] And that my God was in control.
[20:29] But on the hottest days I'd cry, "Oh
[20:33] Lord,
[20:34] isn't it about time?"
[20:40] But the potter knows the clay.
[20:45] How much pressure it can take.
[20:51] How many times around the week
[20:57] till there's submission to his will.
[21:03] He's planned a beautiful design,
[21:08] but it will take some fire and time.
[21:15] It's going to be okay.
[21:20] Cuz the potter knows the clay.
[21:26] He's planned a beautiful design.
[21:32] But it will take some fire and time.
[21:38] It's going to be okay.
[21:44] Cuz the potter, he knows the clay.

[22:10] out situ number 1248.
[22:12] Thank you, Sister Natasha. Appreciated
[22:14] that. I've just had this song on my
[22:17] heart for weeks now and felt that we
[22:19] could just sing it in worship. Lord,
[22:21] pour your spirit out on me. Fall just
[22:23] like the rain. Amen. Why don't we start
[22:25] with the first verse? Lord, I seek you.
[22:33] Oh Lord, I seek you.

[22:43] How I need your touch. Oh, just as a
[22:48] prayer, find my dry and broken places.

[23:14] if I've wondered
[23:19] far away from you.
[23:23] You are all I've ever needed, Lord. Oh,

[23:30] [Music]
[23:31] ever needed.

[23:43] spirit out on me,

[23:58] soul. Oh, come and pour aresh on me
[24:04] and fill my cup again. Oh, heal my
[24:09] heart, Lord.

[24:16] [Music]
[24:18] I need
[24:20] you now
[24:23] for your spirit.
[24:26] Can we just sing that verse once again
[24:27] as a prayer? Lord, I seek you. Oh Lord,
[24:32] I seek. Are you seeking the Lord this
[24:34] morning? Hallelujah. He'll be found of

[25:18] You are all
[25:22] You are
[25:25] [Music]
[25:33] and your spirit
[25:39] on me
[25:41] and my
[25:46] Oh s

[25:55] on me
[25:57] [Music]
[25:59] again
[26:04] my heart
[26:06] and
[26:10] [Music]
[26:12] I
[26:14] for your spirit. For your spirit,
[26:19] [Music]
[26:33] [Music]
[26:36] Heat. Heat. Heat.
[26:41] [Music]
[26:46] Hey,
[26:49] my heart
[26:51] and me.
[27:00] [Music]
[27:29] Wait for a couple of days.
[27:37] [Music]
[27:53] Thank you. had quite serious blockage in
[27:57] the arteries and uh so it was just it
[28:00] was just the Lord that uh it all
[28:03] happened right then that way and they
[28:05] were able to and I think then they put a
[28:08] stint in and actually I'm happy to
[28:10] report they're on their way home right
[28:12] now. So we say praise the Lord for that.
[28:15] &gt;&gt; And
[28:17] [Music]
[28:22] uh our sister Buucy who lives right
[28:23] across the parking lot from us is she's
[28:26] uh she became very very weak and we
[28:29] weren't aware of it for some time and uh
[28:32] uh so they've been doing some checks and
[28:36] on her and and we visited her yesterday.
[28:39] She's in the hospital weak, but she uh
[28:42] she's gaining in her strength. And uh
[28:45] she preached to me for about half an
[28:48] hour. So I said, and I said, "I can see
[28:50] you're getting a little tired." I said,
[28:52] "You've been preaching for h about a
[28:54] while." And uh and she she wanted to be
[28:57] here in service this morning. Uh she's a
[29:00] real soldier. Amen. So I'd like to ask
[29:02] the congregation we'd remember her in
[29:04] prayer when we ask God's blessing upon
[29:06] the word. uh uh if I've ever asked for
[29:10] your keen attention, it'll be today. And
[29:14] I'm approaching
[29:16] uh a subject and saying things that
[29:19] perhaps I've never said. I may share a
[29:22] little part of my testimony at the end.
[29:27] And uh the testimony is because
[29:30] uh uh I had a I had a conversation a
[29:33] personal conversation with brother
[29:34] Brandham and I have not shared this in
[29:38] the 50 years except to one or two people
[29:41] or maybe a handful of people. And so
[29:45] you'll just stay real alert. You won't
[29:47] understand it unless you understand the
[29:50] message.
[29:51] And uh
[29:55] so we're just going to ask God's
[29:56] blessing upon the word and I'll ask for
[29:59] your very very kind attention and no
[30:02] movement uh unless absolutely necessary.
[30:06] May God bless all the people that are
[30:08] streaming and I would ask them to be the
[30:11] same not to be distracted while uh while
[30:15] they're listening
[30:17] &gt;&gt; and may God help us.
[30:20] Let's have prayer.
[30:22] Heavenly eternal father,
[30:26] we are so privileged to be able to add
[30:30] our father,
[30:31] &gt;&gt; my father.
[30:33] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[30:34] &gt;&gt; How you care for your people.
[30:37] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord, for these that have
[30:40] needed you in a moment, Sister Heidi.
[30:42] &gt;&gt; And in a moment of crisis, you come
[30:44] through, oh God,
[30:46] &gt;&gt; and you back away the enemy. our
[30:49] precious sister Buucy. Lord, we just
[30:52] pray she'll be restored in her strength,
[30:54] Lord. And whatever has has been
[30:56] troubling her at all, Lord. You know the
[30:58] cause. Remove the very cause. I pray in
[31:02] the name of Jesus Christ. And for all
[31:04] that are here today, Lord, you know
[31:07] exactly what we need. And I pray that
[31:10] we'll be able to receive and the hearers
[31:13] whether they're streaming on what
[31:15] continent they may be or what country
[31:16] they may be in or those that may hear
[31:19] the archive service. I pray father in
[31:22] the name of Jesus Christ that you will
[31:24] uh gain great victories and we pray that
[31:27] it'll be a contribution to the kingdom
[31:29] of God. We say thy kingdom come thy will
[31:32] be done on earth as it is in heaven.
[31:34] Forgive us our sins, Lord. Forgive us
[31:36] our wrongs and forgive us our debts as
[31:39] we forgive others. Father, I pray that
[31:41] you will be glorified in the name of
[31:44] Jesus Christ. And give us a tent of
[31:46] hearts, a tent of minds, and receptive
[31:49] hearts in the name of Jesus Christ. And
[31:52] may you and you alone be glorified.
[31:55] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[31:57] &gt;&gt; If you'd like to turn in your Bibles,
[31:59] please, with me, to Isaiah the 14th
[32:02] chapter. We're going to read just uh two
[32:04] or three verses
[32:06] starting at verse 12.
[32:32] How art thou fallen from heaven, oh
[32:34] Lucifer,
[32:36] son of the morning? How art thou cut
[32:39] down to the ground, which did weaken the
[32:42] nations? For thou hast said in thine
[32:45] heart, I will ascend into heaven. I will
[32:48] exalt my throne above the stars of God.
[32:52] I will sit also upon the mount of the
[32:54] congregation in the sides of the north.
[32:57] I will ascend above the heights of the
[32:59] clouds. I will be like the most high.
[33:04] Yet thou shalt be brought down to hell
[33:07] to the sides of the pit. May God bless
[33:10] his word to our heart as you have your
[33:13] seat.
[33:23] This is not a sermon. This is a uh a
[33:27] subject that I'm going to leave with
[33:30] you. I feel it is something that God
[33:34] wants me to say
[33:37] uh as we've journeyed along in this uh
[33:41] message in this end time message which
[33:44] God has brought us to. As we've
[33:47] journeyed along, we've uh we've
[33:50] experienced many things and and uh uh
[33:54] some now, you know, have, you know,
[33:58] arrived at some questions in their heart
[34:00] and uh we've we've just had a long
[34:04] journey and uh and so I want to address
[34:08] uh some of these things, but I want to
[34:10] speak on
[34:12] with God's help the I have a title and a
[34:17] subject and the title is the
[34:19] characteristics of Lucifer
[34:22] and the subject is
[34:24] uh the evolution
[34:27] of Lucifer
[34:30] because he has evolved from one thing to
[34:33] another. Uh the characteristics the word
[34:36] characteristics is the showing of the
[34:40] character the showing of the character
[34:43] or traits.
[34:45] It is it can be a feature of a person or
[34:48] a thing that serves to identify it.
[34:52] &gt;&gt; So you see a certain feature you see a
[34:54] certain thing happening and then you can
[34:58] identify it
[35:00] and uh the characteristics can also be
[35:03] the appearance or the attribute.
[35:06] So we say the attribute now
[35:10] uh
[35:12] we we go from Lucifer and this I'll be
[35:16] going through this in the service now
[35:18] from Lucifer
[35:21] to the serpent
[35:23] and from the serpent to Satan and from
[35:27] Satan to the devil.
[35:31] And it's surprising you I until I got
[35:35] into this subject and I have spent it's
[35:37] going to be hard for me to put maybe 40
[35:40] hours into one hour, hour and a half or
[35:43] two. So I may have to I've already
[35:46] spoken with brother Tom. If necessary I
[35:48] may break it and come in the evening but
[35:51] I I I would feel badly if everyone
[35:54] wasn't able to be here to have it all
[35:57] together.
[36:00] uh but even in the scripture
[36:03] you'll find that these various titles
[36:06] came in at specific places in the
[36:09] scripture and that's very amazing very
[36:13] amazing very significant
[36:16] over the years in our Christian walk we
[36:19] have yearned to
[36:22] uh we have yearned and studied the
[36:24] characteristics of Jesus Christ we've
[36:26] desired his character her.
[36:29] &gt;&gt; We've yearned to be like him and we've
[36:32] sung songs and we've prayed and we've
[36:36] asked God that we might be like our Lord
[36:40] Jesus Christ and and often perhaps we
[36:43] have felt uh somewhat discouraged
[36:45] because we don't seem to attain to what
[36:48] we desire about him. But the the the the
[36:53] prophet has said, "Study
[36:57] the enemy."
[36:59] &gt;&gt; We've never really studied the enemy.
[37:03] &gt;&gt; We've never made a study of it because
[37:05] it's it's preachers don't like to really
[37:07] preach about it. I don't really like to
[37:09] preach about it because it's a it's such
[37:11] a negative and can cast such a cloud on
[37:14] people. So, don't you allow Satan to
[37:17] bring, you know, uh, condemnation or
[37:20] anything along that nature, but you do
[37:23] do need to know, uh, where where we're
[37:27] at.
[37:29] &gt;&gt; So, he said, study the enemy.
[37:33] What's he going to do?
[37:35] &gt;&gt; What's his move?
[37:38] &gt;&gt; And and then, uh, I'll also ask maybe
[37:42] those that are saying, "Amen."
[37:45] if you'll just you know don't don't
[37:48] disturb the people and and I asked
[37:50] others to say amen when something
[37:53] strikes you. So so what's he going to do
[37:58] and what's the move and then how to meet
[38:01] him
[38:04] and that's what we're here for. The
[38:07] prophet says that's what we're here for.
[38:12] study the enemy's move and knowing how
[38:15] to meet him,
[38:18] the thing that will overcome him.
[38:23] So
[38:26] that's what we're here for.
[38:29] &gt;&gt; That's what this service is all about.
[38:32] The word of God is always the focus of
[38:35] Satan's attacks. The word of God. Yes,
[38:38] sir. Wherever you find the word of God,
[38:42] that will be the focus of his attacks.
[38:47] &gt;&gt; The message and the integrity of the
[38:51] revealed word of God is being questioned
[38:54] by some. That's no surprise to you.
[38:58] It's always been questioned, but it's
[39:01] been questioned in the past largely by
[39:04] those that are considered, you know,
[39:07] considered in opposition to the message
[39:10] and the messenger.
[39:12] But now of recent times, recent years,
[39:17] even questions have risen from within
[39:19] the body of believers. And that's no
[39:22] surprise to you. And so, let's not be
[39:24] ostrich and put our head in the sand.
[39:26] That's just the facts. And so some have
[39:28] relaxed from it because they don't want
[39:30] to really deal with it and are living a
[39:34] substandard life
[39:38] &gt;&gt; and we don't want that.
[39:42] The prophet said he hates all scripture
[39:46] &gt;&gt; and yet and it's the whole cannon of
[39:49] scripture. But if anything he despises
[39:52] mostly is Revelation
[39:55] and Genesis
[39:57] because Genesis tells the beginning and
[40:00] Revelation reveals what's going to
[40:02] happen to him in the last day. And I I I
[40:07] thank you for your keen attention
[40:08] because by God's help today, I plan to
[40:12] uncover him
[40:14] &gt;&gt; and I want I want it uh to be a
[40:17] stabilizing thing in your heart.
[40:21] To understand a subject, we need to
[40:23] start at the beginning.
[40:27] In the beginning, God dwelt alone
[40:32] with his attributes. That's his
[40:34] thoughts. And there was nothing just God
[40:37] alone. But he had thoughts.
[40:41] And he created angels to worship him.
[40:45] They worshiped him and made him go.
[40:50] In the message adoption, he said he
[40:52] being created his own being created
[40:56] creatures to worship him. His own being
[41:00] in Christ is the mystery of God
[41:02] revealed. He said, "So my opinion, the
[41:06] first thing that he made was angels and
[41:10] then they worshiped him and made him go
[41:14] and he started from there." Lucifer was
[41:17] there.
[41:22] All of those that he deceived were there
[41:26] &gt;&gt; and participated in making him God
[41:31] &gt;&gt; because they worshiped him.
[41:36] &gt;&gt; Now, if there's a statement or two that
[41:38] I make uh that you don't quite see,
[41:41] that's fine. Just hold it there.
[41:44] He created angels so he could be God. He
[41:47] said in Abraham's covenant.
[41:51] So I will say angels are skilled in
[41:54] worship.
[41:59] &gt;&gt; They're absolutely skilled. They know
[42:01] more about worship than you and I will
[42:03] ever discover, I would think, except we
[42:06] can worship at a different level. They
[42:08] have never been redeemed. We have been
[42:10] redeemed.
[42:12] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[42:14] &gt;&gt; In Easter Seal, he said in order to be
[42:16] God, they there had to be something to
[42:18] worship him. So he created angels and
[42:22] beings and cherubams and so forth to
[42:27] worship him.
[42:30] Lucifer was part of that heavenly
[42:32] creation.
[42:37] And there was war in heaven. Michael and
[42:40] his angels fought against the dragon.
[42:43] And the dragon fought in his angels.
[42:47] Revelation 12:8. and prevailed not.
[42:51] Neither was their place found anymore in
[42:54] heaven.
[42:57] And the great dragon was cast out, the
[42:59] that old serpent called the devil and
[43:02] Satan, which deceiveth the whole world.
[43:05] He was cast out into the earth,
[43:09] &gt;&gt; and his angels were cast out with him. I
[43:12] asked the question, why was Satan cast
[43:16] out into the earth?
[43:18] this little speck of of material
[43:23] uh that is so insignificant in the
[43:27] universe. Why wasn't this enemy cast to
[43:30] the outer reaches of the of the cosmos
[43:34] &gt;&gt; so that he couldn't be found for
[43:36] billions of years?
[43:38] &gt;&gt; Why didn't that happen? No, he's cast
[43:41] out into the earth. This is all a plan
[43:45] and God is aware of the plan. He's cast
[43:49] out and the message, notice now, the
[43:51] message is the key that opens up all of
[43:55] these subjects and glorious things. And
[43:58] so the prophet says the earth was the
[44:00] womb.
[44:02] &gt;&gt; The womb for God's seed. God chose the
[44:06] earth where he would direct his spoken
[44:09] word to the seed his seed spoken word
[44:14] seed to the earth and that life would
[44:17] spring forth all manner of life and the
[44:21] life that you have is a result of that
[44:24] spoken word.
[44:28] So it was part of a plan
[44:31] and uh I will I will go to say this that
[44:35] he was cast out to the earth. There was
[44:37] war in heaven and now the prophet says
[44:41] in the greatest battle ever fought and
[44:43] that war now fell upon humans. That war
[44:47] that was the war amongst angels has now
[44:51] fell upon humans. So I want to say to
[44:54] you very clearly the there's a battle.
[44:58] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[44:59] &gt;&gt; And the war that was once in heaven is
[45:01] simply continuing now here on earth.
[45:05] &gt;&gt; This is still the war.
[45:07] &gt;&gt; You are in a warfare.
[45:09] &gt;&gt; And it's important to study your enemy's
[45:12] moves and his tactics
[45:15] &gt;&gt; and his character.
[45:18] &gt;&gt; Yes sir. Amen.
[45:21] And the war continues because the war
[45:24] was not won in heaven.
[45:27] It wasn't won. It began in heaven.
[45:31] Now you may say, is there war in heaven?
[45:33] Well, whatever part of the heavens uh
[45:36] this is this refers to there was war
[45:39] there. The scripture says so. And he was
[45:42] cast out to the earth. And we're not
[45:45] surprised to say there's war taking
[45:48] place here. And the war is on here
[45:51] because the war hasn't been won yet.
[45:54] &gt;&gt; Even though Jesus Christ has won the
[45:56] victory, it's still there's still a part
[45:59] that we're playing.
[46:04] &gt;&gt; And the war will be concluded according
[46:07] to the divine plan in the scriptures.
[46:12] This great first battle that was ever
[46:14] fought is the greatest battle ever
[46:17] fought began in heaven when Michael and
[46:20] his angels fought against Lucifer and
[46:22] his angels. It first started the first
[46:25] battle was in heaven. So sin did not
[46:28] originate on earth. It originated in
[46:30] heaven and then it was thrown down from
[46:33] the heaven cast out of heaven to the
[46:36] earth and fell on human beings.
[46:40] Then that battle from angels became
[46:43] became human battles. Another place and
[46:46] it says have been raging ever since.
[46:51] &gt;&gt; So now the first
[46:54] the first human that this battle fell
[46:57] upon was Adam's bride.
[47:02] &gt;&gt; The first human it fell upon
[47:05] was Eve. Adam's bride.
[47:09] Lucifer needed a vessel.
[47:14] &gt;&gt; A body to manifest through.
[47:19] &gt;&gt; So the he he chose the closest thing to
[47:23] the human race.
[47:26] Now please watch closely.
[47:29] So brother Brandham says that
[47:33] Satan was the Lucifer was the right-hand
[47:36] man of God.
[47:40] and we'll come to it later on. And when
[47:43] he's cast to the earth, he comes to the
[47:46] right hand man or the closest that was
[47:50] next to Adam
[47:52] and the only one. And the and the
[47:55] prophet says he he knew that that was
[47:58] the only one that could mix the seed mix
[48:01] with the human seed because it's too far
[48:04] apart from the other animals.
[48:07] So the closest thing to the human race
[48:11] was the serpent.
[48:13] The serpent he said was like a
[48:15] prehistoric mo man. Something like
[48:18] something next
[48:21] a prehistoric man. He says something
[48:23] next to next to man.
[48:28] Serpent.
[48:30] He said the serpent
[48:32] which was a being more like a man in the
[48:36] mark of the beast.
[48:38] In questions answers he said he was upon
[48:40] his feet stood upon his feet like a man
[48:47] in heaven. Lucifer was right next to
[48:49] God. and on earth he entered and used
[48:53] the serpent which was right next to man
[48:56] who was who was the god of the earth.
[49:01] &gt;&gt; So now the same it's it's a it's
[49:04] something that's evolving. You're
[49:05] following me thus far
[49:10] in the mark of the beast. He said Satan
[49:13] could not have been he said Satan could
[49:16] not have been that serpent.
[49:18] Satan could not have been that serpent.
[49:21] He said, "Oh, I'm sorry." He said, "You
[49:24] say that Satan could not have been that
[49:25] serpent." 2 Corinthians 11:14, the Bible
[49:29] said that he transformed himself into an
[49:32] angel of light.
[49:35] He said, "You just underestimate Satan.
[49:40] &gt;&gt; That's all." Yes, sir. He made himself
[49:42] into an angel of light. If he could come
[49:45] into that kind of a substance,
[49:48] then why could he not come into a beast
[49:52] next to a man?
[49:57] &gt;&gt; Notice Satan changes his mask.
[50:03] &gt;&gt; And the scripture says, "We are
[50:05] instructed by the word of God less Satan
[50:08] should get an advantage of us, for we
[50:11] are not ignorant of his devices." How is
[50:14] it that we're not ignorant of his
[50:15] devices? Because we've learned,
[50:18] &gt;&gt; we've been taught.
[50:20] &gt;&gt; We are to be instructed.
[50:22] &gt;&gt; We are to study the enemy
[50:24] &gt;&gt; and know his tactics. And when he starts
[50:27] moving, I I do a lot of counseling and
[50:31] there's perhaps people here you in the
[50:34] morning you get up and something just
[50:36] doesn't go right and you just kind of
[50:38] feel a heavy weight and so on.
[50:41] You just be you need to know his
[50:43] tactics. He's setting you up for a punch
[50:54] &gt;&gt; less Satan should get an advantage. For
[50:56] we are not ignorant of his devices. In
[50:58] Ephesians says, "Put on the whole armor
[51:01] of God that you may be able to stand
[51:04] against the ws of the devil." And the ws
[51:08] is the methods
[51:10] &gt;&gt; of the devil. He has he has methods that
[51:13] he uses
[51:15] &gt;&gt; and uh we need to be able to withstand
[51:18] it. The wilds is actually method. It's
[51:22] it's
[51:23] methodia in Greek or in the Greek but
[51:27] it's method. It is his scheming, his
[51:31] craftiness, his strategy and his deceit.
[51:35] So, have we studied his strategy?
[51:38] Say, "Oh, well, you know, I've got I I'm
[51:42] uh uh you know, uh
[51:47] I I I have depression."
[51:50] Oh, maybe it's not depression. Maybe
[51:53] it's a devil
[51:55] &gt;&gt; that is troubling you and bothering you.
[51:57] I'm not saying you're possessed. I'm
[51:59] just saying that you allow things to
[52:03] happen that is not glorifying to God.
[52:07] &gt;&gt; I'm just live. Why live in depression?
[52:10] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[52:11] &gt;&gt; Is this of God? No, it's not of God. So,
[52:14] let's let's get rid of that.
[52:18] &gt;&gt; Jesus paid for it already.
[52:24] For we wrestle not against flesh and
[52:26] blood, but against principalities,
[52:29] against powers, against, notice the word
[52:32] against, against rulers of the darkness
[52:36] of this world, against the spiritual
[52:39] wickedness in high places.
[52:42] So I say once again, know your enemy.
[52:46] Prophet said, "A real good fighter, he
[52:48] knows and studies his opponent. He
[52:52] studies his licks or his blows." As you
[52:55] know, Brother Brandham was a boxer in
[52:57] his younger years. And he he said you
[52:59] you'd study how he moves. Sometimes a
[53:03] boxer pulls back and and just how he
[53:06] strikes out. We need to study not only
[53:10] the enemy, we need to study what defeats
[53:13] him
[53:15] &gt;&gt; and what we must do as believers.
[53:18] And I believe, hey, there's no way we're
[53:21] going to get through, uh, this age just
[53:24] by, you know, uh, living well. If the
[53:28] circumstances are just right, you know,
[53:30] then it must be God's will. No,
[53:32] sometimes that isn't what works at all.
[53:34] We have to take the initiative. We have
[53:37] to not be on the offensive but the not
[53:39] on the defensive but the offensive.
[53:42] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[53:47] &gt;&gt; In the questions and answers he said
[53:49] again study. Now I don't want you to
[53:50] think I'm being repetitious. I'm being
[53:52] I'm being repetitious like they say coax
[53:55] the real thing. We've heard it a million
[53:58] times too many
[54:01] because they just keep pumping that
[54:03] forward, you know, because they hope
[54:06] that they'll get people
[54:08] uh into their product. So study the
[54:11] enemy, what he's going to do, what's his
[54:13] move, and then to know how to meet him.
[54:17] And that's what we're here for.
[54:20] So I'd like you now to notice please the
[54:22] I'm going to show some slides and the
[54:26] evolution
[54:30] of Lucifer.
[54:34] Lucifer, how art thou fallen from
[54:36] heaven? Oh Lucifer, son of the dawn.
[54:41] The dawn is the word for the morning in
[54:45] the Hebrew word.
[54:49] I'm going to suggest to you, this is not
[54:51] a doctrine, but I'm going to suggest to
[54:53] you, I'm going to give you a couple
[54:55] quotes, that Lucifer may well have been
[54:59] the first one created. You say, "What
[55:02] about Jesus?" No, Jesus was the creator.
[55:09] &gt;&gt; You say he may have created his own
[55:11] enemy. He may be,
[55:14] he may have.
[55:16] Because this war had to conclude, had to
[55:19] come to an end. And I believe that this
[55:22] creation on this earth has happened to
[55:25] do away because he's going to be cast
[55:28] into a lake of brimstone and fire.
[55:32] &gt;&gt; And this thing is going to end, friends.
[55:35] &gt;&gt; We are not going to go into another
[55:37] realm and be into another battle. The
[55:40] one thing that this word of God has
[55:41] promised is that this is going to end.
[55:45] And that's why he died. That's why the
[55:48] beginning of the new creation of God, a
[55:50] new seed, a new spoken word seed spoken
[55:54] by prophets and anchored in the womb of
[55:57] a virgin woman Mary and brought forth a
[56:00] son, the lamb of God, and died for our
[56:04] sins. He'll never die again.
[56:08] &gt;&gt; He'll never pay that price again. This
[56:10] was all done. We're actually seeing no
[56:13] wonder the prophet says the greatest
[56:15] week in all of history,
[56:18] &gt;&gt; his death and his resurrection. How
[56:20] glorious.
[56:22] &gt;&gt; And here we are if we really believe it
[56:24] that this is an end time message, a last
[56:27] messenger, prophet messenger declaring
[56:30] these things and having given us the key
[56:33] to open the message. Let us not reduce
[56:36] this to a church.
[56:39] Let us not reduce this just to some form
[56:42] of worship. We have the greatest thing
[56:45] &gt;&gt; that's ever struck the globe
[56:50] &gt;&gt; and we should be on we should just be so
[56:53] alert. We should be on the very edge of
[56:55] our seats to think that God has allowed
[56:57] you to be born to come in this age to
[57:00] see the conclusion.
[57:04] Even to think that we are here to see
[57:06] the to have live with the prospects of
[57:08] seeing the end
[57:11] &gt;&gt; of the reign of darkness.
[57:14] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[57:16] &gt;&gt; No reason. We have every reason in the
[57:18] world to rise up and say, "Glory be to
[57:21] God that allowed me to withstand
[57:23] darkness and the principalities and the
[57:27] powers and has equipped me with the thus
[57:30] sayeth the word of God.
[57:40] A quote from the seal of the antichrist.
[57:44] The right-hand man of Almighty God was
[57:46] Lucifer, the son of the morning, the
[57:50] first.
[57:53] God granted him almost co-workers with
[57:56] him. He was a co-worker partly equal
[57:59] with him. only Satan could not create.
[58:03] Notice that only thing he could not
[58:06] create. So if he was the first,
[58:10] then in the beginning when God spoke and
[58:14] Satan was standing there and heard it
[58:21] &gt;&gt; and he saw that spoken word going out
[58:24] and creating
[58:26] &gt;&gt; and it's the only thing he was held back
[58:28] from.
[58:30] So it's that's why he said, "I'll
[58:31] ascend. I'll be like the most high. I
[58:35] want to create."
[58:37] &gt;&gt; And the closest thing he could get to
[58:39] creating was to pervert what was
[58:42] created.
[58:50] &gt;&gt; And then we move from Lucifer, we come
[58:54] down to serpent. Now he's coming down
[58:59] He said he was probably perhaps better
[59:01] looking than Adam.
[59:07] And the serpent was more subtle than any
[59:09] beast of the field. In the mark of the
[59:12] beast says the serpent was a being more
[59:15] like a man. He was right he was right
[59:18] next to the man.
[59:21] And so he who was right next to God,
[59:26] the God now is using an instrument, a
[59:30] vessel that was right next to the God of
[59:33] the earth.
[59:37] &gt;&gt; Think about it.
[59:40] From right next to right next,
[59:43] &gt;&gt; there's a pattern.
[59:45] &gt;&gt; There's an intent.
[59:47] &gt;&gt; There's an agenda.
[59:49] &gt;&gt; And we're studying him. And that is why
[59:52] he would come to the message.
[59:59] &gt;&gt; That's precisely why he will come to the
[1:00:02] spoken word message
[1:00:05] &gt;&gt; to do exactly the same thing he did in
[1:00:08] heaven and did did in Eden. Amen.
[1:00:14] &gt;&gt; Serpent is the meaning of the word is
[1:00:17] snake or reptile in the English
[1:00:21] but it's to practice divination
[1:00:25] insight
[1:00:27] foretelling.
[1:00:29] You'll be like gods.
[1:00:32] He says to Eve you'll be like gods. They
[1:00:36] were already like gods.
[1:00:39] But he's practicing divination.
[1:00:42] &gt;&gt; And it's seeking knowledge by
[1:00:44] supernatural means to discover some
[1:00:47] hidden knowledge.
[1:00:49] That's what serpent is.
[1:00:54] So now we have gone from Lucifer, son of
[1:00:57] the morning, son of the dawn, one that
[1:01:00] has saw creation unfold
[1:01:03] to one who is a part of the creation,
[1:01:06] but he's right next to the God of the
[1:01:09] earth.
[1:01:13] Now
[1:01:16] we move on in this evolution, and this
[1:01:19] is actually just my very preliminary
[1:01:22] part of this message.
[1:01:24] We move on to Satan and now he's an
[1:01:27] adversary. So he's gone from the son of
[1:01:29] the morning
[1:01:31] to a skillful
[1:01:34] diver, one who practices divination,
[1:01:37] uh, subtility,
[1:01:40] the most subtle. Now he's not so subtle.
[1:01:43] He becomes an adversary.
[1:01:45] &gt;&gt; Open adversary.
[1:01:48] &gt;&gt; Now you watch. He'll never He'll never
[1:01:53] leave that pattern.
[1:01:56] He comes like, you know, oh, he'll come
[1:01:59] right in the midst of the most glorious
[1:02:02] service or the most glorious thing
[1:02:04] that's happened. He'll come right in the
[1:02:06] midst of it. And like one who enjoys the
[1:02:10] light is a part of it and then begins to
[1:02:14] uh use his craft and his cunning
[1:02:20] one who withstands or opposes
[1:02:24] uh in in purpose or act.
[1:02:27] And the first time that this appears
[1:02:30] that this title appears in the Bible, he
[1:02:33] is now an adversary of Israel. The first
[1:02:36] time the word Satan, that title appears
[1:02:39] is in Coron, 1 Coronicles 21:1. And
[1:02:43] Satan stood up against Israel. Now, he's
[1:02:47] not so subtle anymore.
[1:02:50] &gt;&gt; And you'll find it even in the
[1:02:52] individual life, and I I haven't got
[1:02:54] anything specific in mind, but you'll
[1:02:56] find it, and each of you can apply it as
[1:02:59] it comes to you, but I I mainly want to
[1:03:01] answer questions about the message as a
[1:03:04] whole. You hear this and you hear that
[1:03:06] and all the rest, it don't worry about
[1:03:08] what you hear. Just worry about the
[1:03:10] individual walk with God. and uh and
[1:03:13] we'll come to some conclusions in the
[1:03:15] end. But Satan finally withstood Israel
[1:03:19] and provoked David to number Israel,
[1:03:21] which was one of David's great errors
[1:03:24] and sins. He numbered Israel. I haven't
[1:03:27] got all the answer for that, but he
[1:03:29] numbered Israel. For some reason, that
[1:03:32] was a great sin against God that he
[1:03:35] would number Israel and God was very
[1:03:37] displeased.
[1:03:39] that happened because because Satan now
[1:03:43] exposes himself as an adversary. So now
[1:03:47] the son of the morning has reduced is
[1:03:49] down to an adversary of God's people.
[1:03:55] &gt;&gt; And the king that God is going to make
[1:03:58] an everlasting covenant with. So he's
[1:04:01] become an adversary. Isn't it amazing
[1:04:04] that this one when he's cast out of
[1:04:06] heaven, he he found the serpent.
[1:04:09] Now he's transformed into another mask
[1:04:14] of Satan and he's found David.
[1:04:21] &gt;&gt; And he hasn't got any problem finding
[1:04:23] you.
[1:04:29] &gt;&gt; That Satan is an adversary.
[1:04:32] This is kind of the whole overview of
[1:04:35] the message.
[1:04:38] Now, devil in the singular does not
[1:04:42] appear in the Old Testament.
[1:04:45] Devils do and it's translated into
[1:04:48] demons
[1:04:50] and certainly those that Satan drew down
[1:04:53] with him. But devil singular
[1:04:57] does not appear in the Old Testament.
[1:05:01] Now, he's a he's not just an adversary,
[1:05:04] but he's a slanderer
[1:05:06] and a false accuser.
[1:05:09] And the first time that it appears that
[1:05:12] the word devil appears in the Bible is
[1:05:15] then was Jesus led up of the spirit into
[1:05:18] the wilderness to be tempted of the
[1:05:20] devil.
[1:05:22] &gt;&gt; And this is Matthew 4 and1. This is
[1:05:24] right at the very beginning of the Lord
[1:05:27] Jesus. And the Bible says that he now
[1:05:29] has fasted and and he's and hungered.
[1:05:33] And so he's weakened.
[1:05:36] &gt;&gt; And Satan knows exactly when we're
[1:05:39] weakened.
[1:05:40] &gt;&gt; He's an opportunist. He knows when
[1:05:43] you've been deprived of the services or
[1:05:45] the fellowship of the saints and you
[1:05:48] become weakened. Uh things things of
[1:05:51] life have weakened you. And he uses he
[1:05:54] uses economics and he uses all kinds of
[1:05:57] things adversity and all kinds of things
[1:06:00] to come and then finally to slander you
[1:06:03] even within yourself with self. What is
[1:06:05] self- condemnation is slander.
[1:06:09] &gt;&gt; Don't slander yourself.
[1:06:12] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:06:15] &gt;&gt; Don't bring false accusations upon
[1:06:17] yourself.
[1:06:19] I I don't even know if I'm going to make
[1:06:21] the rapture. I don't feel like a son of
[1:06:23] God. Don't slander yourself. Don't say
[1:06:27] something about yourself that God has
[1:06:28] said something opposite.
[1:06:32] &gt;&gt; God says you're my son.
[1:06:35] &gt;&gt; Don't reduce that.
[1:06:38] &gt;&gt; If you reduce it, it's a false
[1:06:40] accusation.
[1:06:48] &gt;&gt; That's it.
[1:06:49] &gt;&gt; Say it, brother Roy.
[1:06:51] Hallelujah.
[1:06:55] &gt;&gt; Then was Jesus led up the spirit into
[1:06:58] the wilderness to be tempted of the
[1:07:01] devil.
[1:07:04] Now
[1:07:09] you'll bear with me.
[1:07:32] I'm going to share with you some things
[1:07:33] that I've never ever seen, never ever
[1:07:39] put together.
[1:07:41] This didn't come out of a book.
[1:07:44] I have taken a great deal of time to put
[1:07:47] one scripture after the other and one
[1:07:49] quote after the other. But I want you to
[1:07:52] think of the serpent for a moment. I
[1:07:56] just want to take a step back.
[1:07:58] So now
[1:08:00] Satan has used this vessel
[1:08:04] and he has polluted and entered into
[1:08:07] humanity.
[1:08:09] And when he did that, when he did that,
[1:08:13] when he got a hold of Adam's bride and
[1:08:16] got to her first and implanted the only
[1:08:19] seed that would mix, and the prophet
[1:08:22] says that the that Lucifer knew that
[1:08:27] from his great knowledge and
[1:08:29] understanding of being right next to
[1:08:32] God, he knew that
[1:08:33] &gt;&gt; as the only one that would mix.
[1:08:36] And he got into the serpent, which was
[1:08:39] the next thing so fine,
[1:08:43] structured, handsome,
[1:08:46] perhaps a specimen of almost humanity.
[1:08:50] And the prophet said he almost had a
[1:08:52] soul.
[1:08:56] &gt;&gt; Certainly had a body, but almost had a
[1:08:58] soul. Had a place for one.
[1:09:03] And so then he's cursed by almighty God
[1:09:07] and he's completely changed in his
[1:09:09] entire structure. There's nothing in a
[1:09:12] reptile that that looks like a man. He's
[1:09:16] completely That's the curse.
[1:09:19] &gt;&gt; And God prophesied to him while he's
[1:09:22] still upright
[1:09:24] in the garden. God spoke to him and
[1:09:26] prophesied that uh that the I'll put
[1:09:30] enmity between you and the woman and
[1:09:32] between your seed.
[1:09:35] &gt;&gt; And if anybody ever question about
[1:09:36] serpent seed, just go to that Genesis
[1:09:39] 3:15. Ask them what that means.
[1:09:42] &gt;&gt; You please tell me what the serpent seed
[1:09:44] is. And if they say, "Well, it's
[1:09:46] something." No, no, it's not a migraine
[1:09:48] headache. I'm sorry. It's not something
[1:09:50] in the head. It's not something she
[1:09:52] thought. God didn't say now because you
[1:09:55] thought this. He said because you did
[1:09:57] this.
[1:09:59] And he says it to the serpent because
[1:10:00] you did this. It was an act.
[1:10:07] &gt;&gt; And then he was he said the the seed of
[1:10:10] the woman which doesn't have a seed
[1:10:12] until God gave her a seed.
[1:10:17] &gt;&gt; And it was a spoken word seed that
[1:10:20] produced the new creation. Amen.
[1:10:24] &gt;&gt; And that's what we are a part of this
[1:10:26] morning.
[1:10:27] &gt;&gt; We might look like a church. We're not a
[1:10:29] church in that sense of the word. We
[1:10:31] might look like a denomination. We're
[1:10:33] not a denomination in that sense of the
[1:10:35] word. We're part of a new creation
[1:10:38] &gt;&gt; that came by that spoken word of God.
[1:10:41] And God has not become dumb. He still
[1:10:43] speaks.
[1:10:50] So now, so the serpent,
[1:10:52] the reptile, the serpent became a an
[1:10:58] image or image or symbolic
[1:11:01] of sin cursed.
[1:11:09] &gt;&gt; The prophet says that God was speaking
[1:11:12] through Moses.
[1:11:15] and that Satan was speaking through
[1:11:17] Pharaoh.
[1:11:19] &gt;&gt; So now, now we've moved from the garden
[1:11:23] hundreds of years, many hundreds of
[1:11:25] years, into the palace of Pharaoh.
[1:11:30] And Moses had been the right-hand man
[1:11:34] of Pharaoh.
[1:11:37] &gt;&gt; Now things have just changed
[1:11:40] &gt;&gt; and he's God's man.
[1:11:45] And so
[1:11:48] when God speaks to Moses and he says,
[1:11:51] "Well, the people won't believe me."
[1:11:56] And God says, "What do you have in your
[1:11:58] hand?"
[1:12:00] A rod, a staff, which is an emblem of
[1:12:03] the word.
[1:12:06] Says, "Cast it down."
[1:12:09] Oh, I hope you can follow me. So he cast
[1:12:13] the word down and it became a reptile
[1:12:19] &gt;&gt; and Moses fled from it.
[1:12:21] &gt;&gt; He said, "Don't pick it up." So he picks
[1:12:24] up the emblem of sin cursed.
[1:12:30] &gt;&gt; He picks it up by the tail and it
[1:12:32] becomes a rod again.
[1:12:35] &gt;&gt; In the final end, friends, there going
[1:12:37] to be complete victory over this
[1:12:39] judgment.
[1:12:41] [Applause]
[1:12:43] And so he held it by the tail. It became
[1:12:45] a rod again. Put your hand in your
[1:12:47] bosom. It came out. It was lepous. White
[1:12:50] and lepous. Put it in again. You have
[1:12:53] the answer for sin. You're holding the
[1:12:55] rod which is sin judge.
[1:12:59] &gt;&gt; I judged it in Eden. Yes, sir.
[1:13:01] &gt;&gt; And this is the emblem of it.
[1:13:05] And then we find Moses now
[1:13:09] &gt;&gt; has been told Aaron will be your prophet
[1:13:13] and you'll be God to him
[1:13:15] and go into Pharaoh and say let my
[1:13:18] people go. And after a series of times
[1:13:23] Moses had Aaron and Aaron cast down the
[1:13:28] rod in front of Pharaoh.
[1:13:31] God is in Moses.
[1:13:33] Satan's in peril.
[1:13:35] &gt;&gt; The two are meeting again.
[1:13:39] &gt;&gt; And so now to display who's speaking.
[1:13:44] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:13:44] &gt;&gt; Aaron cast the rod down. It become a
[1:13:46] serpent.
[1:13:48] &gt;&gt; And the other pharaoh, Satan now says
[1:13:52] that's a cheap trick. calls in his wise
[1:13:56] men, anointed men,
[1:13:58] and uh we don't know if they'd ever done
[1:14:01] it before, but they could do it in that
[1:14:02] atmosphere. They cast theirs down and
[1:14:05] theirs become serpents. So, that wasn't
[1:14:08] very convincing.
[1:14:11] Brother Brandham says that Moses rod
[1:14:15] gulped gulped those up gulp gulp gulp
[1:14:18] and went into the wilderness and did
[1:14:20] miracles with it.
[1:14:26] Think about it.
[1:14:27] &gt;&gt; Well, I can tell you one thing. They're
[1:14:31] they're uh
[1:14:34] uh what do I want to say? Not replicas,
[1:14:36] but they're counterfeits.
[1:14:38] &gt;&gt; Their counterfeits were gobbled up by
[1:14:40] the original.
[1:14:42] &gt;&gt; And the prophet of God had that
[1:14:44] original.
[1:14:46] &gt;&gt; It's a prophet that had the rod.
[1:14:48] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And it's a prophet that
[1:14:50] threw it down. and let it become a
[1:14:53] serpent and picked it up by the tail and
[1:14:55] it was back to a rod once again.
[1:15:00] &gt;&gt; Then on into the wilderness, serpents
[1:15:03] came and bit
[1:15:05] &gt;&gt; the children of Israel,
[1:15:08] &gt;&gt; children of Israel. And they're crying
[1:15:11] out. And what does Moses do? He makes a
[1:15:15] serpent of brass. Brass is judged. It's
[1:15:20] something that's been judged. And the
[1:15:22] serpent demonstrating now to all the
[1:15:25] people, not to Pharaoh, but to all the
[1:15:28] people. Sin has been judged. Friends,
[1:15:31] this is something God's been trying to
[1:15:33] get to his people through all these
[1:15:36] centuries of generations. Sin has been
[1:15:39] judged.
[1:15:44] &gt;&gt; And you must accept that. you you ought
[1:15:47] to rejoice over that sin has been
[1:15:50] judged. And God constantly reminded them
[1:15:54] sin has been judged. And all they had to
[1:15:57] do, he didn't have to crawl on their
[1:15:59] stomachs or do they didn't have to fast
[1:16:01] and pray. Just look at sin being judged
[1:16:05] and you'll be healed.
[1:16:08] [Music]
[1:16:10] &gt;&gt; Glory.
[1:16:11] &gt;&gt; Let the congregation say, "Praise be to
[1:16:14] God.
[1:16:19] Hallelujah.
[1:16:22] &gt;&gt; And Moses made a serpent of brass and
[1:16:24] put it upon a pole. And it came to pass
[1:16:29] that that if a serpent had bitten any
[1:16:32] man.
[1:16:35] &gt;&gt; When he beheld the serpent of brass, he
[1:16:37] lived.
[1:16:39] &gt;&gt; Isn't it wonderful the way God can be so
[1:16:41] concise? Any man, any woman, any young
[1:16:45] person, you've been bitten by the
[1:16:47] serpent. I'm here to announce to you,
[1:16:50] he's been judged.
[1:16:53] &gt;&gt; He already has been judged. And all you
[1:16:56] need to do is look at the judgment and
[1:16:58] you'll be free.
[1:17:05] &gt;&gt; Free friends.
[1:17:09] This isn't an in this is not an
[1:17:11] intermission and you have a recess from
[1:17:13] it. You're free.
[1:17:15] &gt;&gt; The price has been paid.
[1:17:17] &gt;&gt; Let this church know and all who ever
[1:17:20] will stream it know. I wish to make this
[1:17:23] announcement under the inspiration of
[1:17:25] the Holy Spirit. The bride of Jesus
[1:17:28] Christ is a sinless, spotless bride.
[1:17:32] &gt;&gt; Virgin bride.
[1:17:35] &gt;&gt; That's what he died for.
[1:17:37] Don't dilute it.
[1:17:41] &gt;&gt; Don't live below your standard.
[1:17:45] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:17:48] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:17:52] &gt;&gt; And then, oh, I can't hardly wait. I'm
[1:17:55] so
[1:17:59] I've been so nervous to come
[1:18:02] so anxious to come to the pulpit
[1:18:05] this morning.
[1:18:10] And then comes
[1:18:13] Jesus on the scene,
[1:18:16] the son of man,
[1:18:20] the new creation.
[1:18:23] And he just comes after 40 days and he's
[1:18:26] hungered.
[1:18:29] And now the devil
[1:18:32] is not now just the son of the morning.
[1:18:35] He's not just one that practices
[1:18:37] divination. He's he's much more than
[1:18:40] that. Now he's not just a slanderer, but
[1:18:43] now he's an accuser.
[1:18:47] &gt;&gt; And the two look at each other in the
[1:18:50] face again.
[1:18:53] The two that fought in the heavens
[1:18:57] are now face to face
[1:19:00] &gt;&gt; on the earth
[1:19:02] &gt;&gt; where the war has continued.
[1:19:06] And the same one who has such a brazen
[1:19:11] attitude
[1:19:12] now he comes not as to divine or to to
[1:19:16] interpret the scripture so much but he's
[1:19:18] coming and he's setting him up as a
[1:19:20] false accuser. If you're the son of God
[1:19:25] make these stones to be bread you're
[1:19:27] hungry.
[1:19:29] He was not saying there is no son of
[1:19:32] God. He was saying if you're a son of
[1:19:34] God,
[1:19:36] &gt;&gt; he doesn't come saying there's no bride.
[1:19:39] &gt;&gt; He doesn't come saying there's no
[1:19:41] believers.
[1:19:42] &gt;&gt; He comes saying, "Do you think you're
[1:19:44] one?
[1:19:48] &gt;&gt; Rise up against him this morning."
[1:19:51] &gt;&gt; Say, "Based on the word of God, I deny
[1:19:54] you, Satan.
[1:19:56] &gt;&gt; You're the same serpent from the
[1:19:58] beginning.
[1:20:00] I know your origin
[1:20:02] &gt;&gt; and I know your end
[1:20:04] &gt;&gt; and I'm in the midst of a battle and I'm
[1:20:07] here to tell you you are not victorious.
[1:20:10] &gt;&gt; You will not win the victory over this
[1:20:13] individual.
[1:20:15] &gt;&gt; Bloodbot,
[1:20:17] &gt;&gt; a new creation.
[1:20:20] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:20:22] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:20:25] &gt;&gt; And so Jesus honored his ministry. Now
[1:20:28] he's coming he's coming towards the
[1:20:32] great victory of Calvary.
[1:20:35] So he says, "And as Moses
[1:20:39] lifted up the serpent in the wilderness,
[1:20:44] so must the Son of Man be lifted up."
[1:20:48] Because now the real proof of his
[1:20:51] judgment has come onto the earth. And in
[1:20:55] the greatest week of all history, it's
[1:20:57] going to hang the new creation of God
[1:21:01] and take the flesh to death
[1:21:04] &gt;&gt; and bring it back in a resurrection.
[1:21:09] &gt;&gt; Let's say hallelujah.
[1:21:11] [Music]
[1:21:12] &gt;&gt; Oh, glory to God.
[1:21:20] &gt;&gt; Amen. Yeah.
[1:21:22] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:21:24] &gt;&gt; And if anything would restrict you from
[1:21:27] giving praise to our Lord Jesus Christ,
[1:21:30] I can tell you it's coming from the
[1:21:32] kingdom of darkness.
[1:21:35] &gt;&gt; The kingdom of light wants to thank him.
[1:21:37] The kingdom of light wants to praise
[1:21:39] him. The kingdom of light, hallelujah,
[1:21:43] &gt;&gt; your children of the day, the scripture
[1:21:47] says,
[1:21:55] Hallelujah.
[1:21:58] &gt;&gt; And now this progresses.
[1:22:04] Now
[1:22:06] Lucifer
[1:22:08] has moved on down.
[1:22:13] Jesus the great shepherd has acquired
[1:22:18] a little congregation
[1:22:23] 12.
[1:22:26] He's given them power.
[1:22:29] They've seen him demonstrate and
[1:22:31] manifest the power of God.
[1:22:33] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:22:35] &gt;&gt; And they believed on him.
[1:22:38] But now Satan is moving up close
[1:22:42] and he has one who will become
[1:22:46] &gt;&gt; the son of predition.
[1:22:49] &gt;&gt; And so the son of God and the son of
[1:22:52] predition.
[1:22:54] Now Satan once again has become like the
[1:22:57] right-hand man. He's the treasurer.
[1:23:03] &gt;&gt; Listen friends, I can only say what the
[1:23:05] Bible says.
[1:23:07] He's holding the bag
[1:23:10] &gt;&gt; and he deals with the finances
[1:23:13] &gt;&gt; of the congregation
[1:23:23] &gt;&gt; and the two of them are together.
[1:23:29] They look into each other's eyes
[1:23:33] and they pro progress until they're at
[1:23:36] the last supper, the last Passover
[1:23:40] &gt;&gt; that our Lord Jesus is going to have
[1:23:44] is in the company of his enemy
[1:23:48] &gt;&gt; who he cast out of heaven
[1:23:53] &gt;&gt; and they're having the last communion
[1:23:55] together.
[1:24:00] The disciples are filled with questions.
[1:24:06] Things have gotten strange in the
[1:24:08] message. Who Who's going to betray him?
[1:24:11] He said, "Somebody's going to be
[1:24:12] betrayed."
[1:24:14] Do you know, Brother Tim? Do you know,
[1:24:16] Brother John?
[1:24:18] Who who would do such a thing?
[1:24:20] &gt;&gt; Mercy.
[1:24:24] &gt;&gt; And Jesus dips the stop.
[1:24:27] that was like a choice thing
[1:24:30] and gives it to Judas
[1:24:33] and says, "What thou doest do quickly."
[1:24:39] Then Satan entered him
[1:24:44] &gt;&gt; and he became this son of predition
[1:24:48] and went out and sold the Lord Jesus for
[1:24:52] a measly 30 pieces of silver.
[1:24:55] I'll say to you young people, adults in
[1:24:58] this congregation,
[1:25:00] don't sell out
[1:25:02] &gt;&gt; the most precious thing
[1:25:04] &gt;&gt; for some measly material stuff.
[1:25:10] &gt;&gt; Don't sell it out for an education.
[1:25:13] &gt;&gt; Don't sell it out for money. Don't sell
[1:25:16] it out for material things. Don't sell
[1:25:19] it out because you haven't got time.
[1:25:24] [Music]
[1:25:28] The day will come when we'll look on
[1:25:30] these things and say
[1:25:33] this is nothing.
[1:25:35] &gt;&gt; This doesn't mean anything.
[1:25:38] &gt;&gt; And I'm not suggesting for a moment that
[1:25:40] we don't that we cease living the lives
[1:25:42] that we have to live and working and
[1:25:44] paying our bills and all of those
[1:25:45] things. That's how the kingdom of God
[1:25:48] continues. And I trust that you tithe
[1:25:50] when that time comes. That's the best
[1:25:53] money that you can invest.
[1:25:56] &gt;&gt; Can I hear amen from that?
[1:26:00] &gt;&gt; That's how God's work continues. And
[1:26:03] I'll tell you, we're
[1:26:05] we be good stewards
[1:26:07] by God's help. That's why people from
[1:26:10] near and afar
[1:26:12] send offerings
[1:26:14] to this church because they know that
[1:26:18] something happens with it.
[1:26:20] Whether it be print stations, whether
[1:26:22] it's translators, whether it's I don't
[1:26:24] know how it happens, but that's how it
[1:26:26] happens.
[1:26:27] &gt;&gt; You give and God's work continues on.
[1:26:29] And we all give as ministers.
[1:26:32] &gt;&gt; Not I'm not talking about time. I'm
[1:26:34] talking about of our earnings. We give.
[1:26:36] &gt;&gt; I think it's a joy.
[1:26:39] &gt;&gt; Earn all you can, give all you can.
[1:26:55] In the first seal,
[1:26:59] though you young people have been going
[1:27:00] through the seals, in this act tonight,
[1:27:03] in the first seal, brother Brandham says
[1:27:06] in this act
[1:27:08] tonight, we're going to see that it's
[1:27:11] Satan changing his mask.
[1:27:15] and all actors. Christ acting the part
[1:27:19] as he did when he became from a spirit
[1:27:22] to man.
[1:27:24] He only put on an actor's garment,
[1:27:27] &gt;&gt; human flesh, and came down in the form
[1:27:30] of a man in order to be a kinsman
[1:27:33] redeemer.
[1:27:36] In the third seal, he says the second
[1:27:38] rider, horse rider it is, uh was exactly
[1:27:42] the same man only he was on another
[1:27:46] horse which is another power. He just
[1:27:48] used another power. This power now was
[1:27:52] this era was over. He get on another
[1:27:54] power. What was rising? And the the
[1:27:57] power that exists today in the world is
[1:28:00] not uh one of, you know, uh maybe
[1:28:04] centuries ago, but things change. We're
[1:28:08] in a high tech area now,
[1:28:10] &gt;&gt; high-tech part. And Satan knows how to
[1:28:13] use it, does he not?
[1:28:16] &gt;&gt; And he uses it to damn people.
[1:28:20] &gt;&gt; And at the same time, he sends It's the
[1:28:22] same It's the same battle. It's the same
[1:28:25] thing that's going on. And in the
[1:28:27] heavens, there's still a incredible
[1:28:30] struggle because God is is giving his
[1:28:35] word. And he'll let that pure word be
[1:28:38] out there in the midst of all of this
[1:28:41] incredible filth.
[1:28:44] &gt;&gt; But he'll also burn and cleanse the
[1:28:46] heavens.
[1:28:47] &gt;&gt; The prophet said in future home that the
[1:28:50] heavens will be on fire. According to
[1:28:52] Peter's gospel, the heavens will be on
[1:28:54] fire. He said, because the demons, the
[1:28:56] demon powers and the powers of darkness
[1:28:58] in high places, all of those things are
[1:29:01] going to be burned up. He said, it will
[1:29:03] not be merely a literal fire. It'll be a
[1:29:05] holy fire.
[1:29:06] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. For a holy fire from God.
[1:29:10] Yes, sir.
[1:29:13] &gt;&gt; He says he's riding he's on another
[1:29:16] horse. What happened? He said he changed
[1:29:19] his ministry.
[1:29:23] Are you too weary?
[1:29:27] &gt;&gt; He said, "We found out he was an
[1:29:29] antichrist
[1:29:31] and he had changed his position.
[1:29:35] &gt;&gt; We found out that when he first when he
[1:29:38] first just was a white horse, he became
[1:29:41] a doctrine.
[1:29:44] &gt;&gt; Listen real close now." And then in the
[1:29:45] second seal again he said he started in
[1:29:48] with a demon of a false teaching.
[1:29:53] Listen very close with a demon of a
[1:29:56] false teaching and that teaching became
[1:29:59] a doctrine.
[1:30:01] &gt;&gt; And that doctrine become incarnate in a
[1:30:04] false prophet.
[1:30:06] That's the evolution of it.
[1:30:10] You know, maybe I'll just break into a
[1:30:13] little further in the service, but
[1:30:16] he say what kind of approach does he
[1:30:19] come with?
[1:30:21] His approach is exactly as it was to
[1:30:25] Eve.
[1:30:27] &gt;&gt; His most cunning approach was when he
[1:30:30] came and said,
[1:30:32] "Did did God say
[1:30:36] &gt;&gt; he wasn't an enemy? He wasn't an
[1:30:38] adversary. He wasn't I I need to
[1:30:40] introduce something now. So he just
[1:30:43] comes with a simple question on the
[1:30:46] message.
[1:30:48] &gt;&gt; Was it God that did God say that?
[1:30:54] Fine. Smooth. Brother Brandham said he's
[1:30:57] a slicker.
[1:30:59] &gt;&gt; He said don't try to challenge him with
[1:31:01] the word. He knows more about the
[1:31:02] scripture than you do.
[1:31:05] &gt;&gt; Don't try to answer him.
[1:31:07] That's exactly what he wants is somebody
[1:31:09] to respond and answer
[1:31:11] &gt;&gt; and try and justify your position. You
[1:31:14] don't have to justify your position.
[1:31:16] Say, "Well, what about this? What about
[1:31:18] this question? I've got all kinds of
[1:31:21] questions. I just leave him to God.
[1:31:24] &gt;&gt; If he wants me to know, it might be like
[1:31:27] the disciples that said, "Is this the
[1:31:29] time you'll restore the kingdom?" And he
[1:31:31] said, "It's not for you to know the
[1:31:32] times of the seasons." What kind of
[1:31:35] answer is that? is saying it's none of
[1:31:36] your business.
[1:31:38] And that's God's own prerogative. He can
[1:31:41] say that. It's not for you to know.
[1:31:43] Heath freely given us all things that
[1:31:45] pertain to life.
[1:31:48] &gt;&gt; That's what the scripture says.
[1:31:50] &gt;&gt; I know this is resounding in your heart.
[1:31:52] He He's given us all things that pertain
[1:31:54] to life. We got all kinds of questions.
[1:31:57] How many angels can stand on the head of
[1:31:59] a pin? How does that do? Is that got
[1:32:01] anything to do with your salvation? Is
[1:32:03] he coming on a cloud or is he coming on
[1:32:05] a horse or he's coming who cares? He
[1:32:07] said he's coming.
[1:32:10] &gt;&gt; We don't care how he comes or any of
[1:32:12] that. That's his business.
[1:32:19] &gt;&gt; I'm coming home now. So, what what what
[1:32:22] made the cloud? We have a picture of a
[1:32:24] cloud. What made the cloud? All kinds of
[1:32:26] things. Was brother Brandham there?
[1:32:28] Wasn't he there? Was he standing on the
[1:32:30] ground? Wasn't he standing on the
[1:32:31] ground? I'll say a person only shows
[1:32:33] their ignorance by trying to explain it.
[1:32:38] &gt;&gt; If you want to start there, go back to
[1:32:40] Ezekiel and and and tell me about the
[1:32:42] book of Ezekiel.
[1:32:44] &gt;&gt; Tell me about the wheel within the wheel
[1:32:46] and how it moved and the living
[1:32:48] creatures and where they went. What's
[1:32:50] the whole story about? I don't know, but
[1:32:52] it's in the Bible and I believe it.
[1:32:58] &gt;&gt; Moses was told to strike the rock. He
[1:33:01] hit it twice.
[1:33:04] &gt;&gt; And because that he didn't get to go
[1:33:05] into the promised land, but it didn't
[1:33:08] change him as a prophet. He still
[1:33:10] remained a prophet.
[1:33:11] &gt;&gt; He was the word of God to the people.
[1:33:18] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:33:19] &gt;&gt; Go ahead, folks. Let the word free you
[1:33:21] up.
[1:33:27] Moses comes with thus sayaith the Lord
[1:33:33] &gt;&gt; and Moses says you shall not make any
[1:33:36] graven image
[1:33:37] &gt;&gt; of any likeness of anything that's on
[1:33:39] earth or in heaven
[1:33:41] &gt;&gt; and then the same God comes and tells
[1:33:43] him something that's irreconcilable.
[1:33:46] Now you'll make uh you'll make you make
[1:33:48] these images of cherubams and you'll put
[1:33:51] them in the most holy place right over
[1:33:54] the mercy seat.
[1:33:56] &gt;&gt; I'd like somebody to explain that
[1:34:00] &gt;&gt; here. Here's here's another one even
[1:34:02] more difficult
[1:34:04] says more than one time. Thus sayith the
[1:34:07] Lord in the scripture and please
[1:34:09] remember I want everybody's attention.
[1:34:12] Please remember that when Jesus was here
[1:34:15] on earth, the only word they had was the
[1:34:19] Old Testament. That was the cannon of
[1:34:22] scripture.
[1:34:24] &gt;&gt; And they and the scripture says the word
[1:34:27] says, "You shall not eat any meat that
[1:34:30] has blood in it.
[1:34:32] &gt;&gt; You will not eat the blood of it, nor of
[1:34:35] a beast, or of anything because the life
[1:34:38] is in the blood." And I have the
[1:34:40] scripture. You shall not eat anything
[1:34:43] with blood in it and no flesh with blood
[1:34:45] in it because the life is in the blood
[1:34:48] and says it once, twice, three times,
[1:34:50] maybe four times. And and the and the
[1:34:53] and the people that lived in Jesus time
[1:34:56] had thus saith the Lord by the prophet
[1:34:59] Moses. Now, here arises this young
[1:35:03] prophet out of Galilee, and he sang to
[1:35:06] the people. And now the people, he's got
[1:35:09] a small congregation about him and look
[1:35:11] like a cult.
[1:35:16] &gt;&gt; And then he comes right down to his
[1:35:18] message part when it starts getting real
[1:35:20] squeak. He says, "Except you eat my
[1:35:22] flesh
[1:35:23] &gt;&gt; and drink my blood, you have no life in
[1:35:26] you." They said, "Ah, away with that."
[1:35:31] &gt;&gt; Amen. I'd like some of the people of
[1:35:33] this day to rise up and please explain
[1:35:35] that for me.
[1:35:38] &gt;&gt; Come on folks, free yourself.
[1:35:42] &gt;&gt; Explain that one.
[1:35:45] &gt;&gt; You have a thus sayith the Lord and a
[1:35:47] thus sayith who?
[1:35:51] &gt;&gt; You have a thus sayith the Lord and a
[1:35:53] thus sayith the Lord. And I say to you,
[1:35:55] the Lord can do what he wants.
[1:35:59] &gt;&gt; He can do what he wants. He can say what
[1:36:01] he wants because we don't understand
[1:36:04] everything he's saying.
[1:36:11] [Music]
[1:36:14] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:36:19] &gt;&gt; But he keeps progressing.
[1:36:22] So he he he he can come as a question as
[1:36:25] just uh s uh and then I want to say
[1:36:29] something to you and please
[1:36:33] put this down in your heart behind the
[1:36:37] question is an agenda.
[1:36:41] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:36:42] &gt;&gt; And it's not the question or the answer
[1:36:45] to the question he wants. He wants to
[1:36:47] put forward his agenda. And his agenda
[1:36:51] is to get you to de disbelieve.
[1:36:56] &gt;&gt; And you see people maybe they have a a
[1:36:59] problem or difficulty with a brother or
[1:37:02] a sister or something and and then
[1:37:05] finally it it causes them to step out of
[1:37:09] the fellowship and they're not in the
[1:37:11] company of the believers anymore. You
[1:37:13] know the direction. That's when an
[1:37:16] agenda is in effect. That's right.
[1:37:18] &gt;&gt; Not an answer to a question. That's an
[1:37:21] agenda.
[1:37:22] &gt;&gt; And the agenda and listen to me friends.
[1:37:25] Some of these that come questions into
[1:37:27] your mind or someone raises question in
[1:37:30] your mind. It's not a question for a
[1:37:33] spiritual answer. The agenda is behind
[1:37:37] the question. And the agenda is to get
[1:37:40] you to disbelieve this word.
[1:37:43] [Music]
[1:37:44] &gt;&gt; Go ahead and let it free you.
[1:37:48] Go ahead and rejoice.
[1:37:51] &gt;&gt; God has provided a way.
[1:37:54] &gt;&gt; He's provided an answer and he's the
[1:37:57] answer.
[1:37:59] &gt;&gt; If he wants to say things that sound
[1:38:01] completely irreconcilable,
[1:38:03] so be it. Because we we puny
[1:38:07] insignificant. We got brains that aren't
[1:38:09] even worth a a teaspoon of ashes. And
[1:38:12] we're going to understand what's going
[1:38:14] on in another dimension.
[1:38:17] We creatures of time are going to
[1:38:19] understand timelessness and eternity.
[1:38:27] &gt;&gt; And don't forget this one.
[1:38:29] &gt;&gt; Anyone that has a question concerning
[1:38:32] anything the prophet of God has spoken
[1:38:35] and you see that there's an agenda
[1:38:37] behind it, know your enemy.
[1:38:42] know the subility
[1:38:44] &gt;&gt; and simply answer with this.
[1:38:48] Yes, that's correct. That's what he did
[1:38:50] say.
[1:38:52] And uh but I have perhaps two or three
[1:38:56] thousand
[1:38:58] things that he said to individuals in
[1:39:00] public
[1:39:01] &gt;&gt; and they said it's true. It's true all
[1:39:03] the time.
[1:39:04] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:39:05] I want you to come with one of those
[1:39:09] &gt;&gt; revealing of the secret of the hearts of
[1:39:11] the people. I want you to come with
[1:39:13] that. I want you to duplicate that. And
[1:39:16] once you have, then I will listen to
[1:39:18] you.
[1:39:19] &gt;&gt; But not until then. And don't even come
[1:39:22] back to me until you can do that.
[1:39:25] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:39:27] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:39:29] [Applause]
[1:39:30] &gt;&gt; Glory to God.
[1:39:32] &gt;&gt; Because that was our God.
[1:39:35] And I'm so glad I can listen to those
[1:39:37] tapes or listen to that however reading
[1:39:39] that book. And when I do, my heart is
[1:39:41] moved. I say that's my God.
[1:39:46] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:39:47] &gt;&gt; That's his characteristics.
[1:39:52] &gt;&gt; That's how he works.
[1:39:54] &gt;&gt; That's how he speaks. And that's how he
[1:39:56] manifests himself.
[1:40:01] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:40:03] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:40:05] Hallelujah.
[1:40:08] &gt;&gt; Glory.
[1:40:15] &gt;&gt; Says in questions and answers, he says,
[1:40:17] "And then train for the knockout
[1:40:19] punches."
[1:40:21] &gt;&gt; That's what we're doing right now.
[1:40:23] &gt;&gt; Don't train for a little, you know, a
[1:40:26] little click on the chin. Train for the
[1:40:29] knockout punches. I think I just gave
[1:40:31] you one. You come back when you can do
[1:40:35] what my prophet did and once you can and
[1:40:38] don't come back until then
[1:40:43] &gt;&gt; because your question is not an answer.
[1:40:53] &gt;&gt; He says and now the enemy is going to
[1:40:55] study your strategy.
[1:41:00] The enemy is going to study our strategy
[1:41:02] with the word. And now Satan studied
[1:41:05] that studied that all out so perfectly
[1:41:09] till he come to Eve and he had the best
[1:41:12] strategy he could use upon her and that
[1:41:15] was to reason with the word.
[1:41:18] &gt;&gt; That is his best strategy
[1:41:22] &gt;&gt; is to reason with the word.
[1:41:27] doesn't even have maybe an answer, but
[1:41:29] he reasons with the word. Now, he says
[1:41:31] this. Now, listen. I have highlighted in
[1:41:34] red. Now, you never want to reason with
[1:41:38] God's word.
[1:41:40] &gt;&gt; Just believe it.
[1:41:42] &gt;&gt; Don't try to explain it.
[1:41:44] &gt;&gt; Don't try to figure it out. He says,
[1:41:47] "Now, you cannot figure God out."
[1:41:52] &gt;&gt; So, God is the word, and it's just made
[1:41:55] to believe. Amen.
[1:41:57] &gt;&gt; He said, "Know your enemy, know his
[1:41:59] attacks."
[1:42:04] &gt;&gt; And when he came to Eve,
[1:42:07] this is one of the significant
[1:42:09] characteristics, he offered her more
[1:42:11] light.
[1:42:16] I I've seen more things in my years in
[1:42:19] the message come in and people get all
[1:42:21] enthused. Oh boy. I've had them come up
[1:42:24] to me says, "If you don't see this,
[1:42:26] you're you're you're out of it. You're
[1:42:28] you're just serpent seed or you're a
[1:42:30] shock or whatever more." Well, I'll just
[1:42:32] have to wait till the right now. It
[1:42:34] hasn't happened. No, it hasn't hasn't
[1:42:38] clicked in.
[1:42:41] You're so nice and quiet. I suspect
[1:42:43] you've heard the same thing.
[1:42:48] &gt;&gt; I've had people come with a box of
[1:42:50] tapes. You got to hear these. You got to
[1:42:52] hear these. If you don't hear these,
[1:42:53] you're out of it. You know what? I can't
[1:42:57] even find them today amongst the company
[1:42:58] of the believers.
[1:43:00] &gt;&gt; They're gone. Elder Skel are gone
[1:43:03] everywhere. Why? Because they got
[1:43:05] enticed
[1:43:06] &gt;&gt; and began to reason with the word of
[1:43:09] God. We cannot reason with the message.
[1:43:12] And then they'll turn around and say,
[1:43:13] "Oh, you're just gullible. You're
[1:43:15] exactly right. I just eat all he says
[1:43:19] [Applause]
[1:43:21] &gt;&gt; and I just wait for it to come to pass.
[1:43:26] &gt;&gt; I' I've had questions in this message
[1:43:28] that have stayed with me for years.
[1:43:32] &gt;&gt; But I'm going to share a part of my
[1:43:35] testimony in a few minutes in public
[1:43:40] only because someone else has made it
[1:43:42] public.
[1:43:44] They didn't know I was there, but they
[1:43:46] put it out as though brother Brham was
[1:43:50] false or speaking presumptuously.
[1:43:54] And that's the word they used from the
[1:43:56] Old Testament. Or speaking beyond the
[1:43:59] boundaries of your
[1:44:02] authority,
[1:44:04] speaking inappropriately,
[1:44:06] that's what it means. And I I just felt
[1:44:09] if anyone
[1:44:11] wants to raise that,
[1:44:14] you have to forgive me because
[1:44:17] I'm going to tell you part of a
[1:44:18] testimony I've held for almost exactly
[1:44:21] 50 years
[1:44:24] and I have never told it publicly.
[1:44:27] I'm going to conclude the service with
[1:44:29] it in just a few moments.
[1:44:46] he offered more light
[1:44:50] and then in victory day
[1:44:54] he said Eve failed to hold her focus
[1:44:58] I say to this church to all that are
[1:45:01] streaming
[1:45:03] whatever you You don't become
[1:45:06] distracted. Hold your focus and sharp
[1:45:10] focus. I'll keep my eye upon that word
[1:45:13] and I'll I'll just wait for it to
[1:45:15] happen. I'll wait for it to be
[1:45:16] fulfilled.
[1:45:29] &gt;&gt; This has to do with the brown bear
[1:45:31] vision.
[1:45:35] And I had a I had a pastor actually call
[1:45:38] me and ask me if if I knew something
[1:45:43] about that and he thought that perhaps
[1:45:45] you can clarify some questions
[1:45:50] and uh so I I thought I'll go back and
[1:45:54] see
[1:45:56] uh where was the source you know I don't
[1:45:59] know exactly how I will answer this Yes,
[1:46:04] I contacted him and I said I I was there
[1:46:07] then I got other people that were asking
[1:46:09] and
[1:46:11] and so on a on the website called
[1:46:15] believe the sign.
[1:46:18] Uh they they have that up as a big brown
[1:46:22] bear vision
[1:46:24] and that uh I have some slides actually
[1:46:30] but I wanted to tell you that I was
[1:46:32] there
[1:46:34] and in the in the account they give two
[1:46:39] quotes and I'm going to give them to
[1:46:40] you. The two quotes where brother
[1:46:43] Brandham speaks about the big brown
[1:46:44] bear. talks about the caribou and the
[1:46:47] grizzly
[1:46:49] which I was in that vision and then it
[1:46:53] took about six hours to be fulfilled
[1:46:56] and then he says and I'll get another
[1:46:58] bear
[1:47:00] and you wait and see a big brown bear
[1:47:03] and he describes it in in several
[1:47:05] different places he doesn't give quite
[1:47:07] the details like the measurement of the
[1:47:10] horns and so on he doesn't give the same
[1:47:12] details and I want to stop right now
[1:47:15] because the question came to to my own
[1:47:18] heart and people will say
[1:47:21] what's what's the issue about shooting a
[1:47:24] big brown bear? Well, I will take you to
[1:47:27] the scripture and say the very God
[1:47:30] himself.
[1:47:32] Jesus Christ, God in flesh, says to his
[1:47:35] disciples,
[1:47:37] "Cast your net on the other side."
[1:47:39] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:47:40] &gt;&gt; And they catch a net full of fish.
[1:47:44] What's fish got to do with salvation?
[1:47:46] What what's what's fish got to do with
[1:47:48] our religion? What's fish got to do? It
[1:47:50] meant something to them.
[1:47:53] &gt;&gt; And they caught 153 great fish and the
[1:47:57] net and the that was number one miracle.
[1:48:00] Number two, the net didn't break. Number
[1:48:02] three, they got to shore and the one who
[1:48:04] spoke has fish already cooking.
[1:48:08] &gt;&gt; Come and dine.
[1:48:13] And John says,
[1:48:15] "I think it's the Lord."
[1:48:21] Hallelujah. What's that got to do?
[1:48:23] What's with the brown bear got to do
[1:48:25] that? That's God's business. If he wants
[1:48:28] 153 fish or 3,000 fish, it that's none
[1:48:31] of my business. That's what's in the
[1:48:33] word of God. Did they catch it? Yes,
[1:48:35] they caught it and ate some. And I don't
[1:48:38] know what they did with the rest. That's
[1:48:39] not my business. you know, twist around
[1:48:42] dispute and so on. God knows what he's
[1:48:45] doing.
[1:48:47] &gt;&gt; Are you satisfied with that?
[1:48:48] [Music]
[1:48:52] So,
[1:48:55] uh
[1:48:57] let's see what we have here
[1:49:07] in May 1962.
[1:49:10] I'll have you look at the dates
[1:49:12] carefully in the message possessing all
[1:49:15] things. Many of you remember the vision
[1:49:17] that I had where I had shot the grizzly
[1:49:20] bear, nine- foot grizzly bear. And
[1:49:23] church remembers me telling it here in
[1:49:25] the caribou.
[1:49:27] And I had and that's where I was
[1:49:29] standing with a check green checkered
[1:49:31] shirt. And I seen a and I seen I seen a
[1:49:35] great huge brown bear. That might be a
[1:49:38] Kodiak. And it wouldn't have worked down
[1:49:41] there in Canada cuz they're not there,
[1:49:44] you see. But wherever and now Kodiak are
[1:49:46] not there and wherever it will be it
[1:49:49] it'll be it will be that's thus sayeth
[1:49:53] the Lord it will be
[1:49:58] then in June the next month in message
[1:50:02] presuming
[1:50:04] now I'm going back into the country that
[1:50:06] you might know when I come back next
[1:50:09] year I'm going to get a brown bear
[1:50:13] that's almost twice that size. You see
[1:50:16] if it's you see if it's right or not. I
[1:50:19] seen it when he was standing when he was
[1:50:23] standing put my hands on his hunches
[1:50:27] laying on the ground like that and I
[1:50:29] could put my hands on his hips like that
[1:50:32] and him laying down there. Now you find
[1:50:35] out if that's right or not.
[1:50:38] Uh you find out if that's right or not.
[1:50:42] Then this is what you people just watch
[1:50:47] me first rather than read.
[1:50:49] You people are the first people
[1:50:53] that I have as a congregation
[1:50:56] put this quote up and have told what's
[1:51:00] taken place
[1:51:02] and I felt that I was responsible to
[1:51:05] you.
[1:51:07] I don't know if God would call me away,
[1:51:09] but I want you to have this.
[1:51:11] And so in September 1962, and I have
[1:51:16] after the hunt.
[1:51:18] Now on the website, believe the sign.
[1:51:22] They say William Brham, and I'll read it
[1:51:25] for you later on, but they say William
[1:51:27] Brham was
[1:51:29] on Vancouver Island in 1962 and held six
[1:51:32] services and did not shoot that bear.
[1:51:36] He returned to northern British Columbia
[1:51:39] with Perry Green in 1964
[1:51:43] and he did not shoot that bear. So their
[1:51:46] conclusion was that William Brham the
[1:51:50] thus said the Lord did not take place
[1:51:53] and he did not get that bear and
[1:51:56] therefore what is what is the what is
[1:51:59] the agenda?
[1:52:01] Well, the agenda is obvious in the
[1:52:03] direction the supporters of that have
[1:52:05] gone.
[1:52:07] &gt;&gt; Let's not play games.
[1:52:09] &gt;&gt; People are either serving God uh or or
[1:52:13] serving God in the light of this message
[1:52:15] or they've chosen a different way.
[1:52:17] &gt;&gt; And and uh uh so they said he returned
[1:52:21] in 1964. What they don't know is
[1:52:25] that he returned in 1962.
[1:52:29] Now you know and in 1962
[1:52:34] he says he says and this is in September
[1:52:37] which is just after the hunt
[1:52:42] and I was with him on that hunt and he
[1:52:46] says so I in these 30 going on 32 years
[1:52:51] of ministry I have tried to stay true to
[1:52:54] the word
[1:52:56] &gt;&gt; that's the subject matter
[1:52:59] I have tried to stay true to the word. I
[1:53:01] don't know of one thing I've ever had to
[1:53:04] alter
[1:53:05] &gt;&gt; alter on because I just read it out of
[1:53:08] the Bible
[1:53:11] said just what the Bible said and let it
[1:53:14] go like that. And so I haven't had to
[1:53:17] take back or rearrange because I just
[1:53:21] said it the way that the Bible says it.
[1:53:25] &gt;&gt; You understand where his source is?
[1:53:27] He said, "And I find out
[1:53:33] if God has spoken anything, then we must
[1:53:37] go with that word in order, we must go
[1:53:41] with that word in order to make it be
[1:53:45] fulfilled."
[1:53:47] &gt;&gt; Is that clear?
[1:53:51] &gt;&gt; I don't think there's a person here and
[1:53:53] I don't think there's a man alive ever.
[1:53:56] But what was instructed or led or told
[1:54:01] of God to do a certain thing and then we
[1:54:05] ended up we didn't do it.
[1:54:08] &gt;&gt; There wouldn't be a person here that
[1:54:10] wouldn't say that I haven't that I have
[1:54:14] never ever ever ever disobeyed
[1:54:17] the word of God.
[1:54:19] &gt;&gt; It's not it's it's just human.
[1:54:25] &gt;&gt; We are humans. And we do that. I'm not
[1:54:28] setting you up. I'm saying truth. And if
[1:54:31] you're here and you've never disobeyed
[1:54:32] God, I ask you to please stand. We want
[1:54:35] to all applaud you.
[1:54:39] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:54:40] &gt;&gt; It's amazing.
[1:54:44] &gt;&gt; So, we all have confessed that we have
[1:54:47] disobeyed at some time.
[1:54:55] He says
[1:54:58] he says uh
[1:55:03] and then this is following the same
[1:55:05] quote. He says we seen that in other
[1:55:08] words what did he see
[1:55:11] that God has spoken anything then we
[1:55:14] must go with that word in order to make
[1:55:16] it be fulfilled.
[1:55:19] We seen that
[1:55:21] &gt;&gt; as I told you last night of a vision
[1:55:24] just recently. See,
[1:55:27] I had to be there and warning to be
[1:55:30] there and telling me 6 months before to
[1:55:33] be on that spot and stand there and
[1:55:36] saying go down there three times with
[1:55:40] them. I was one of the them.
[1:55:44] And I just walked on with the other man
[1:55:48] and the vision passed through exactly
[1:55:53] God's part.
[1:55:56] &gt;&gt; And I was left standing.
[1:56:01] &gt;&gt; So we want to remember we've got to stay
[1:56:03] on the word, stay right with the word.
[1:56:07] And where the word leads, you go right
[1:56:09] with the word and it'll bring you out.
[1:56:12] All right. I'm sure
[1:56:23] &gt;&gt; brother Brandham, Billy Paul,
[1:56:27] Brother Southwick, and his son Blaine,
[1:56:28] and myself,
[1:56:30] we went out.
[1:56:33] Uh we rode from Brother Southwick's
[1:56:35] place up at mile 441 on the Alaskan
[1:56:38] Highway
[1:56:39] and rode in uh a full day's journey on
[1:56:44] horses into the mountains and it was a
[1:56:47] beautiful beautiful day and the next day
[1:56:50] we got up and it was a beautiful day
[1:56:53] and now I'm just telling you this as
[1:56:55] testimony. I have it all written here
[1:56:57] which you can't have but anyway I just
[1:57:00] here for reference and uh so the we rode
[1:57:04] in and then the next day we we got up
[1:57:07] and it was a beautiful day and the sun
[1:57:11] just shining beautiful in the mountains
[1:57:13] and brother brother Bud I remember he
[1:57:17] just standing and he kind of he kind of
[1:57:18] mumbled but I was the more or less the
[1:57:21] point person because I arranged the
[1:57:23] hunts I bought the food and did those
[1:57:26] things and arrange for however many were
[1:57:28] going because you actually count how
[1:57:31] many slices of bread you're going to
[1:57:32] use, how many eggs you want, and you
[1:57:36] count everything because these are
[1:57:38] having to be carried in maybe 25 or 30
[1:57:42] miles on horses. So, you you count
[1:57:45] everything.
[1:57:47] So, we got up that morning and and bud,
[1:57:50] he's kind of looking down like this and
[1:57:52] he says, "Uh, well, I I think Brother
[1:57:55] Brandham, no, I'm sorry." He said, "Uh,
[1:57:58] Blaine," he said, "you you take, uh,
[1:58:02] Brother Billy, Paul, and Eddie, and go
[1:58:05] someplace." I didn't pay any attention
[1:58:07] because they were just up in the
[1:58:08] mountains. I don't know one valley or
[1:58:10] one creek from another, one river from
[1:58:13] another. You go this way. And he said,
[1:58:16] "And brother Brandham, uh, Brother
[1:58:18] Brandham and I, we'll just go up on a
[1:58:21] hill here behind the camp." It was
[1:58:24] beautiful. It was just mostly grass. In
[1:58:28] fact, is it happens to be the same
[1:58:30] valley where brother and I were sitting
[1:58:33] on the edge of that mountain. And it was
[1:58:36] soon after he went beyond the curtain of
[1:58:39] time. And he looked down this valley
[1:58:41] this way and looked down this way and he
[1:58:45] said,
[1:58:47] "Brother Eddie, on the other side it is
[1:58:51] very much like this.
[1:58:54] And when you cross over," he said,
[1:58:56] "you'll find little paths."
[1:58:59] &gt;&gt; He said, "You walk down one of those one
[1:59:01] day and you'll find me."
[1:59:05] &gt;&gt; I believe that's thus sayith the Lord.
[1:59:10] And it was that valley and they were
[1:59:11] going to go up. Now the reason they were
[1:59:13] going to go up the hill, the mountain
[1:59:15] just behind it was a more gentle slope.
[1:59:19] And brother Bud, which no one knows
[1:59:22] except there might be one or two here,
[1:59:24] he had angina quite bad. Angina just
[1:59:28] restricted him to exert himself very
[1:59:31] much. So he'd he'd climb for a little
[1:59:34] short distance and then he'd have to
[1:59:36] rest. if he had to run after the horses.
[1:59:38] He'd have to stop and catch his breath
[1:59:40] and he had a lot of pain. And then he he
[1:59:44] was also thinking of brother Brandham
[1:59:46] because this was the first day out and
[1:59:49] both of them are about double our age.
[1:59:52] Uh and uh and so they were going to take
[1:59:55] the mountain just behind the camp.
[1:59:58] So we struck off and where we uh down
[2:00:02] this valley and then then the first
[2:00:05] mountain that we came past there was a
[2:00:07] little little narrow valley. They just
[2:00:09] went up and ended in a in a basin and it
[2:00:13] just it it just flared out like that on
[2:00:16] this mountain and on this mountain and
[2:00:19] we were up about a quarter of the way
[2:00:21] onto a ledge.
[2:00:24] Not a lot of trees or stuff there. Just
[2:00:26] mostly willows and so on because we're
[2:00:29] above timber.
[2:00:31] And we just got on this ledge and we're
[2:00:34] looking up this little basin and here
[2:00:37] comes a big bear. He was big. I'm going
[2:00:40] to describe him. And he was he was
[2:00:43] coming right at the V only he was just
[2:00:45] on the other ledge on the other side.
[2:00:48] And he's just going down slowly and
[2:00:50] turning over stones and looking for
[2:00:53] rodents and things to eat. And grizzlies
[2:00:55] eat also roots. So they dig roots or
[2:00:58] whatever. And he was So we watched him
[2:01:00] and watched him and we stopped right
[2:01:03] then. We're right on the knob of this
[2:01:05] big valley going this way and this
[2:01:06] little one going up here. And we just
[2:01:09] stopped and we we crouched behind some
[2:01:11] willows and we watched him come and he
[2:01:14] came down and just taking his time. And
[2:01:17] I think we watched him for perhaps half
[2:01:19] an hour.
[2:01:21] And he came right down to the little
[2:01:24] bald point of this uh valley right
[2:01:27] across from us. And and he just standing
[2:01:30] there and you know looking over the
[2:01:33] whole country and and brother Billy and
[2:01:36] brother Blaine they're kind of egging me
[2:01:39] on. I said, "Shoot him, brother Eddie.
[2:01:41] Shoot him." and I had quite a powerful
[2:01:45] uh 7mm magnum weapon and uh was flat
[2:01:49] shooting in the mountains and I said,
[2:01:50] "No, no, I wouldn't even think of
[2:01:53] shooting him." I said, "Brother Brandham
[2:01:54] hasn't fired a shot, you know." He said,
[2:01:58] "You ought to shoot him. Why don't you
[2:01:59] shoot him?"
[2:02:01] this bear. I I've lived in the north a
[2:02:04] good part of my life and I have seen
[2:02:07] probably hundreds of bears because where
[2:02:09] I lived they were more common than a
[2:02:12] dog. I didn't have a dog but we had
[2:02:14] bears in the camp every day and and this
[2:02:18] bear was massive. In fact, his brother
[2:02:21] Blaine Southwick, who is a grizzly bear
[2:02:23] hunter and guide, told me he has never
[2:02:27] seen one that size.
[2:02:30] He was big. He looked almost black to
[2:02:33] me, but he wasn't black like a black
[2:02:35] bear. He was just dark. But he was most
[2:02:38] unusual. I'm going to describe him for
[2:02:40] you. And my description now is 100% the
[2:02:45] truth.
[2:02:46] &gt;&gt; I have never seen a bear of this type
[2:02:49] before. He had right behind his ears
[2:02:53] coming around his neck like that and
[2:02:56] down to about his hump. and I would
[2:02:58] estimate about a foot wide, a band. And
[2:03:02] that band came down and down his chest
[2:03:07] completely over his cape area. And he
[2:03:11] was the color of ripe, golden ripe wheat
[2:03:16] in the harvest time. And I cannot tell
[2:03:20] you what kind of bear that was. I can
[2:03:23] only tell you I have never seen one.
[2:03:25] Blaine has never seen one. And he was
[2:03:28] the most magnificent animal that you
[2:03:31] could imagine. And we looked at him a
[2:03:34] long time. And so a couple two, three
[2:03:37] times said, "Shoot him. Shoot him,
[2:03:38] brother Eddie." I said, "No, no, no. I'm
[2:03:40] not I'm not." And then I saw this
[2:03:43] massive head. He just standing out there
[2:03:45] like that. We're right over here. And he
[2:03:48] and he stand there and he he puts that
[2:03:50] head up in the air. Oh boy. I knew what
[2:03:52] he was doing. He he got a scent of
[2:03:54] something, you know. And I got poor
[2:03:56] eyesight, but incredible, incredible
[2:03:59] scent. And he's waving that massive head
[2:04:01] back and forth like this, getting then
[2:04:03] he just went like this
[2:04:08] and just like burned two holes straight
[2:04:10] through those little bushes we were
[2:04:11] trying to hide behind. And I knew he
[2:04:14] knew exactly where we were. And we just
[2:04:16] sat there and he just took another
[2:04:18] moment and he just whirled like this and
[2:04:21] took off straight up this mountain. And
[2:04:23] this mountain was snowcapped. And he
[2:04:26] galloped. He galloped. And I was waiting
[2:04:28] for him to stop and have a rest. He
[2:04:30] galloped. He kept on galloping. Then he
[2:04:33] hit the he hit the glacier which was
[2:04:35] snow. And I saw these massive tracks in
[2:04:37] the glacier. We're looking at him
[2:04:38] through the glasses and he goes right up
[2:04:40] over the glacier and uh disappears over.
[2:04:44] It took between 12 I think 12 to 15
[2:04:46] minutes and he was gone. Thought what an
[2:04:50] incredible creature this was.
[2:04:54] And so we we continued on that day when
[2:04:56] we got home that afternoon.
[2:04:58] So we tell brother Bud and brother
[2:05:00] Brandham, "Oh, we saw a big bear. You
[2:05:02] know, we're not thinking about vision.
[2:05:04] We're not trying to fulfill things and
[2:05:06] figure things out. They've just we're
[2:05:07] out hunting. You know, I got brother
[2:05:10] Brandham out there for a rest and I hope
[2:05:11] we're having a good time." And and uh so
[2:05:15] we told them about, you know, the day
[2:05:16] that we had had. And actually, if you
[2:05:18] ever come to my house, I'll show you the
[2:05:20] caribou I got that day. And then
[2:05:24] that night sometime, I don't know, we
[2:05:26] were sleeping, it it started to rain.
[2:05:29] And if you've ever been in the mountains
[2:05:31] and decides to rain and it we call it
[2:05:34] socked in. It just socked in.
[2:05:38] And we got up in the morning and it
[2:05:40] rained that day, rained that night,
[2:05:43] rained the second day, rained the second
[2:05:46] night, rained the third day, rained the
[2:05:49] third night, rained the fourth day, and
[2:05:52] after breakfast the fourth day,
[2:05:54] everything isn't wet. It's just sogging.
[2:05:59] You have to understand, we haven't seen
[2:06:01] a We haven't seen a ray of anything.
[2:06:04] just nothing but soaked in uh clouds
[2:06:07] hanging low and pouring rain most of the
[2:06:09] time.
[2:06:11] And uh
[2:06:14] that's what Bud says. He says kind of in
[2:06:16] mumbling to me. He said, "I think
[2:06:19] brother Brandham wants to go home."
[2:06:22] What? I turn. We're all in the tent.
[2:06:25] We've got cabin fever.
[2:06:28] They They're not hunters.
[2:06:32] Cabin fever is when you're all locked
[2:06:33] together f you know five persons in one
[2:06:36] tent for four days you get cabin fever.
[2:06:40] You know we just want to get out of
[2:06:41] here. We love each other but we we'd
[2:06:45] like to have a recess.
[2:06:48] And so
[2:06:51] I I go to I said brother Brham do you
[2:06:54] want to leave? You want to go home? Oh
[2:06:56] he said brother Eddie said we've had a
[2:06:59] wonderful time. I thought
[2:07:03] I just felt so discouraged,
[2:07:06] you know, we haven't even started. And
[2:07:09] and I said, ' But but you haven't even
[2:07:11] fired a shot. He says, "That means I can
[2:07:14] come back next year." I thought, "What a
[2:07:17] way of looking at things. That isn't the
[2:07:20] way I want to look at it. I want to go
[2:07:22] out there and, you know, whatever."
[2:07:25] And and so I just stood there. I thought
[2:07:29] and Bud starts packing things up into
[2:07:32] the paniards and they have to be even
[2:07:34] weight from one side to the other on the
[2:07:36] horse otherwise he goes lopsided and you
[2:07:38] have trouble.
[2:07:40] So he's starting to pack up and I am
[2:07:43] depressed. I am really depressed. I
[2:07:47] thought, you know, all the effort and
[2:07:49] all the time to come up here and all the
[2:07:52] preparation and and bud to take the best
[2:07:55] part of his season is worth a lot of
[2:07:58] money to him. I wasn't thinking of the
[2:07:59] money and I was just thinking we came up
[2:08:02] here to give brother Brandham a rest and
[2:08:04] we've somehow it hasn't happened.
[2:08:07] So
[2:08:09] you have to if you don't understand
[2:08:12] you please I'll try to dramatize this.
[2:08:16] Everything is so wet and cold and we're
[2:08:19] frozen and we're miserable and
[2:08:22] everything is wet. The ground is wet.
[2:08:25] The horses are wet. They're ornery. They
[2:08:28] hate to be packed. They don't want the
[2:08:31] cinches up tight on them and making them
[2:08:33] cuz they're wet and cold and they don't
[2:08:36] want the saddles on them and they just
[2:08:38] are, you know, everything's difficult.
[2:08:41] The tent weighs about three times its
[2:08:43] weight.
[2:08:46] And uh
[2:08:48] so I I think the tent we had down when
[2:08:51] we got the stuff out, we've got a stove,
[2:08:53] we've got everything to pack. All of our
[2:08:55] bed rolls have to be packed. And so I
[2:08:58] I'm standing outside
[2:09:01] and brother Brham, Brother Brham comes
[2:09:04] up and he says, "Brother Eddie," he
[2:09:06] said, "Where did you brother see that
[2:09:08] bear?" And I said, "Well, right up here.
[2:09:12] You just go up this valley here and that
[2:09:15] right this first hill, this little
[2:09:16] valley going in there. I said he was
[2:09:18] right in there.
[2:09:20] Oh, and and and I've seen brother
[2:09:22] Brandon this way more than once. You
[2:09:25] know, when he when something is very
[2:09:27] much on his mind, he and he kind of gets
[2:09:32] a little jerky with his movements. And
[2:09:35] so, uh, Bud, how long are we gonna be?
[2:09:38] You know, and I I think I asked Bud as
[2:09:39] well, you know, how long are we gonna
[2:09:41] be? You know, Brother Bud says, "Oh, you
[2:09:43] got lots of time, but we won't get out
[2:09:46] of here till maybe noon, you know,
[2:09:48] couple hours away." And so, Brother
[2:09:51] Brandon put his gun and then struck off
[2:09:53] right through the willows, the low
[2:09:55] willows like this. And away he was gone.
[2:09:59] And I had my horse now and had the horse
[2:10:01] saddled and
[2:10:03] tied up just to a twig here.
[2:10:05] and
[2:10:07] Bud and Blaine were were over about as
[2:10:10] far as that door is with the horse and
[2:10:14] they were starting to pack these
[2:10:17] paniards and you have to do it with a
[2:10:18] diamond hitch and it's a lot of
[2:10:21] uh I have never learned how to tie that
[2:10:24] hitch. So, they were busy doing that and
[2:10:27] getting all the horses packed and
[2:10:30] and uh I'm sitting on my horse now. I
[2:10:33] get on my horse. We got our rain gear.
[2:10:35] And you have to understand the woods and
[2:10:38] the willows and the trees, everything
[2:10:41] you touch is just laden with water.
[2:10:45] And
[2:10:47] even our rain gear wouldn't keep it all
[2:10:49] out. So I'm sitting on my horse maybe an
[2:10:52] hour, hour and a half, two hours later
[2:10:55] and uh brother Brandham comes out and he
[2:10:58] comes and stands right now. I'm I'm
[2:11:01] sharing with you now a personal
[2:11:02] conversation.
[2:11:04] And the reason why I haven't ever made
[2:11:07] it public is and I'm going to leave one
[2:11:10] line out because brother Brown was very
[2:11:12] private with me, very personal, but I'm
[2:11:15] going to give this to you.
[2:11:19] I'm sitting on the horse. He says,
[2:11:22] "Brother Eddie
[2:11:24] points up the sky, says this is on
[2:11:25] account of me."
[2:11:28] He said, And he made another little
[2:11:30] statement about disobeying the vision.
[2:11:34] He said, "It's the only time,
[2:11:36] the only time I know, this is the only
[2:11:39] the second time I know that I disobeyed
[2:11:41] a vision." He said, "The other time, you
[2:11:44] know," he says, "You know, in Africa and
[2:11:45] so on." And he was just going off and
[2:11:48] and about Africa and and the vision. And
[2:11:51] I I knew about something when the
[2:11:53] ministers pressed him, you know, and he
[2:11:55] he built he surrendered under the
[2:11:58] pressure of the ministers to do a
[2:11:59] certain thing and then suffered for for
[2:12:01] it. And so I'm not offering to say
[2:12:04] anything, you know, says that's only the
[2:12:07] second time I disobeyed a vision. He
[2:12:09] says, he says, he just went like this,
[2:12:12] but it's over and we'll ride out of here
[2:12:15] dry.
[2:12:22] That's the most incredible statement
[2:12:26] you could hear.
[2:12:29] We're just sogged wet. Horses are wet.
[2:12:34] Tent is wet. Everything is just
[2:12:38] completely
[2:12:39] soaked.
[2:12:41] And for a man to stand there and say,
[2:12:43] "We're right out of here dry.
[2:12:46] There's no break in the sky. The clouds
[2:12:49] are just heavy laden down.
[2:12:52] &gt;&gt; I didn't even know how to respond.
[2:13:01] &gt;&gt; And he goes about
[2:13:03] starts doing whatever maybe with his bag
[2:13:05] or whatever. And I'm just sitting there
[2:13:09] and uh
[2:13:12] I'm not thinking about the statement.
[2:13:14] I'm just discouraged that he hasn't got
[2:13:16] anything. And we're on our way out.
[2:13:21] And I'm I'm sitting and I remember like
[2:13:23] it was five minutes ago, not yesterday,
[2:13:25] like five minutes ago.
[2:13:28] And it wasn't it wasn't a wind, it
[2:13:29] wasn't a it wasn't a breeze. It was a
[2:13:32] puff of air, like air current and it
[2:13:36] went
[2:13:38] past me like that. And the only reason I
[2:13:41] remembered so well, it was so warm.
[2:13:44] &gt;&gt; I thought, "Boy, that was nice.
[2:13:47] just such a nice warm just a puff just a
[2:13:51] current of air. It maybe wouldn't have
[2:13:53] happened again, but then you know the
[2:13:56] air current just begin to move. move.
[2:13:58] There's air currents moving like that
[2:14:00] and pretty soon it turned into a little
[2:14:02] light breeze and and the willows which
[2:14:04] are just over where those doors are are
[2:14:07] shaking like this and the water's
[2:14:10] falling off of the leaves and bud keeps
[2:14:12] on uh getting the horses saddled up and
[2:14:17] and I I sit there
[2:14:20] and it's like five minutes ago I'm
[2:14:22] sitting there
[2:14:24] and the horse and I just thought this is
[2:14:27] you Oh, I like this air current. It's
[2:14:30] nice. It's the warmest air I've felt in
[2:14:32] the last several days.
[2:14:35] And out in out in front of me, probably
[2:14:39] where the boys and sister Darlene and
[2:14:41] you folks are right there. I'm sitting
[2:14:43] here like this. My horse is pointed this
[2:14:45] way. And I I look and there's a big
[2:14:48] patch of sunlight
[2:14:50] just shone down on the ground, like a
[2:14:54] great big round patch of sunlight.
[2:14:56] probably 30, 40 feet across, 50 feet
[2:14:59] across and and and I just instinctively
[2:15:02] I just went like this and it just a big
[2:15:05] hole. I just looking straight up a big
[2:15:07] hole through the clouds at a beautiful
[2:15:10] blue sky and I remember like I thought,
[2:15:13] boy, that looks good. I haven't seen
[2:15:16] that for days. That just looks so good.
[2:15:20] I wasn't thinking of any vision. I
[2:15:22] wasn't thinking of anything. I didn't
[2:15:24] dream I'd ever have to say it over a
[2:15:25] pulpit.
[2:15:28] And it was just my own personal
[2:15:30] experience
[2:15:31] that I've held
[2:15:33] 50 years.
[2:15:36] And uh while I'm sitting there just
[2:15:39] looking at that, the air just gets warm.
[2:15:42] Mo the current of air is moving now.
[2:15:44] It's into a breeze. Never gets into a
[2:15:47] wind. Just a wonderful breeze. And it
[2:15:50] just blowing around like that. in a
[2:15:52] patch of sunlight is before our horses
[2:15:56] took a step. The sky was I won't say
[2:16:00] cloudless, but you would say cloudless.
[2:16:05] Just totally blue sky. And I would say
[2:16:09] that happened in about 20 minutes.
[2:16:12] And the reason why I'm so moved,
[2:16:15] these poor people don't know
[2:16:19] and they should not have tampered with
[2:16:21] it.
[2:16:23] &gt;&gt; He was there.
[2:16:25] &gt;&gt; They've tampered with the prophet's life
[2:16:27] and they tampered with a vision that
[2:16:30] came past. He said passed through.
[2:16:34] Exactly. There we were, the three little
[2:16:37] fellows. There was the bear's massive
[2:16:39] bear. There was everything. And now
[2:16:41] we've had four days of storm and we have
[2:16:44] a a a man who under that inspiration
[2:16:47] says we'll ride out of here dry. I want
[2:16:50] to say to everyone who will ever hear
[2:16:52] this, if I rode out wet, I would not be
[2:16:56] here.
[2:16:57] &gt;&gt; That's just how much I believe it. If I
[2:17:00] rode out wet, I would not be here. I
[2:17:03] wouldn't be standing here telling you
[2:17:04] this. I rode out in my shirt sleeves. I
[2:17:08] had to take off the gear, take off my
[2:17:10] rain gear, and we rode out dry for eight
[2:17:14] hours.
[2:17:28] And that's my testimony and personal
[2:17:31] witness. And that's precisely what
[2:17:33] brother Brandham is referring to. And I
[2:17:36] conclude this. You say, why do you put
[2:17:39] this on the end of this? Because that is
[2:17:42] only one of perhaps many. If I wanted to
[2:17:45] raise questions, I could raise
[2:17:48] questions. It's up to God.
[2:17:51] &gt;&gt; The disciples minds and hearts were
[2:17:53] filled with all kinds of questions. I
[2:17:55] got questions about the resurrection. I
[2:17:58] don't know. I got questions about the
[2:17:59] earthquake. I don't know. But I can
[2:18:02] assure you one thing. what God has
[2:18:05] ordained and intended to happen is going
[2:18:07] to happen exactly according to his plan.
[2:18:11] And and and and I said to this pastor, I
[2:18:14] just said, and God bless him. I've
[2:18:17] contacted him since, but I just said to
[2:18:19] him, I said, I was there. I was in the
[2:18:22] storm. I heard what the prophet of God
[2:18:25] said. It has never even entered my mind
[2:18:30] that that had any effect upon him in his
[2:18:32] office. I I I respected him even more
[2:18:37] for saying, you know, this is on account
[2:18:39] of me. He didn't have to say that. We
[2:18:41] could have just gone out and rode out
[2:18:43] wet. We've done that lots of times. But
[2:18:46] when he said that and we wrote out
[2:18:49] absolutely dry and then and then and
[2:18:51] then I came across, he never told me to
[2:18:53] read this. I was reading the message one
[2:18:56] day and there I'm in September 1962. I
[2:19:00] said, "That's right after our hunt."
[2:19:02] Wow. There he refers right to it. And
[2:19:05] and I think that is so that just make
[2:19:08] fills my heart with such admiration. And
[2:19:11] so I want to say to you and all who care
[2:19:13] to listen to me, I just say we had thus
[2:19:16] sayeth the Lord
[2:19:18] &gt;&gt; and the vision passed through perfectly.
[2:19:21] He is a human. He is a man. And then
[2:19:24] someone will try to discredit and say,
[2:19:26] "Listen, I just want to say to you, we
[2:19:28] have Isaiah, Ezekiel, Daniel, all not
[2:19:32] everything that those men did is written
[2:19:34] in the Bible. It's not everything they
[2:19:37] said is written in the Bible. It's that
[2:19:39] which God has ordained should be in the
[2:19:41] scriptures in the scripture." And we
[2:19:43] have had we have a word prophet. We have
[2:19:46] a living message. And there are just and
[2:19:48] I I'll conclude with this. If anyone
[2:19:51] ever wants to even even if the devil
[2:19:53] comes to your mind says, "Well, what
[2:19:55] about this or what about that?" Just
[2:19:57] say, "Well, I have one for you, Satan."
[2:19:59] Uh, you you come with the kind of the
[2:20:02] kind of and they call it a gift. That's
[2:20:04] not a gift of healing. That was that was
[2:20:06] God taking possession of the vessel,
[2:20:09] speaking directly to people, revealing
[2:20:11] the secret of their heart to prove to
[2:20:14] the whole world that he had an obedient
[2:20:17] messenger on the earth that he could
[2:20:19] control sufficiently so that he he he
[2:20:22] was he would have sufficient uh uh uh
[2:20:26] qualifications so that he could take and
[2:20:29] speak the opening of the seals, things
[2:20:31] that have been sealed since the
[2:20:33] foundation of the world, and speak it to
[2:20:35] us to a group of people that are
[2:20:37] believers
[2:20:39] &gt;&gt; and I believe it
[2:20:41] &gt;&gt; with all my heart.
[2:20:42] &gt;&gt; God bless you
[2:20:44] &gt;&gt; in Jesus name.
[2:20:46] &gt;&gt; Would you like to stand with me?
[2:20:56] I hope that you've been able to receive
[2:20:58] this
[2:21:00] as not a sermon and not an ordinary
[2:21:04] service, but it'll it'll provide light
[2:21:07] and guidance for you in the coming days.
[2:21:13] Heavenly Father,
[2:21:17] I do not know exactly how to express
[2:21:20] myself to you and to the people that sat
[2:21:23] so attentively
[2:21:25] and how I was so directed
[2:21:30] and see this evolution of Lucifer.
[2:21:34] And we're down here to the last moments
[2:21:37] of time
[2:21:39] when uh the scripture, your scripture
[2:21:42] tells us that he comes down with great
[2:21:44] wrath because he knows his time is very
[2:21:47] short.
[2:21:48] &gt;&gt; And we're thankful that his time is
[2:21:50] short.
[2:21:52] &gt;&gt; We're giving you praise, Lord God,
[2:21:54] because you're in control of everything.
[2:21:56] &gt;&gt; Whether the things we see and understand
[2:21:58] or things we do not see and do not
[2:22:00] understand, we say you're God. You're
[2:22:04] the creator of heavens and earth and all
[2:22:06] things that are therein. You're eternal
[2:22:09] in your being. And we cannot even begin
[2:22:11] to grasp that. How your prophet said
[2:22:13] you'd be so mysterious for all these
[2:22:16] billions and trillions of years that
[2:22:18] you've existed. I cannot understand
[2:22:20] that. I couldn't even begin to try to
[2:22:22] explain that. But we believe it. And we
[2:22:25] believe that when we draw our last
[2:22:26] breath or when that sweep comes over us,
[2:22:29] just like that puff of warm air, that
[2:22:31] sweep will come over us and we'll be
[2:22:33] changing our atoms in a moment and in
[2:22:36] the twinkling of an eye. And as sure as
[2:22:39] the testimony which I just gave and the
[2:22:41] people believe it, Lord. And I certainly
[2:22:43] believe it cuz I lived it. Father, I
[2:22:46] want to give this testimony to you and I
[2:22:48] pray that you'll take the Holy Spirit
[2:22:50] and drive it as far as it needs to go
[2:22:53] and let it be received in every heart
[2:22:55] where it needs to be received. And
[2:22:57] Father, I pray that you will energize us
[2:23:00] to withstand the enemy and to stand firm
[2:23:04] and strong in this generation. I pray,
[2:23:07] Father, that people will receive this uh
[2:23:10] when we see such an invasion into the
[2:23:12] message. This is a message that's a call
[2:23:14] to arms. We resist the enemy in the name
[2:23:18] of Jesus Christ. Satan, you serpent, you
[2:23:22] have no power and you have no control
[2:23:26] and you have no part with us. We be the
[2:23:29] children of the day, the children of
[2:23:31] night, not the children of darkness, and
[2:23:33] the children of night. And in the name
[2:23:36] of Jesus, we claim glorious victory.
[2:23:40] Hallelujah.
[2:23:41] Hallelujah to the lamb of God. Oh, we
[2:23:45] praise your name, Lord.
[2:23:47] &gt;&gt; In Jesus Christ's name, I ask your
[2:23:49] blessing upon the people, Father. And as
[2:23:52] we prepare for the evening service and
[2:23:55] our brother Tom Ray comes to speak, I
[2:23:58] ask that you will anoint him mightily,
[2:24:00] oh God, and give us a refreshment this
[2:24:03] afternoon in Jesus Christ's name. And
[2:24:06] for your glory,
[2:24:08] hallelujah.
[2:24:10] Hallelujah.
[2:24:12] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Praise God.
[2:24:16] &gt;&gt; Amen. And amen.
[2:24:18] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:24:18] &gt;&gt; Glory to God. I wonder if we could sing
[2:24:21] victory in Jesus my savior forever. He
[2:24:24] bought me and he sought me. Come
[2:24:26] brother.
[2:24:32] Of course.
[2:24:38] in Jesus my savior forever
[2:24:45] and my
[2:24:48] redeeing love
[2:24:52] I do and all is to him
[2:25:01] the cleansing blood I heard all story
[2:25:06] How he gave the glory. How he gave his
[2:25:11] life on Calary to save like me. And I
[2:25:19] rolling my fresh
[2:25:23] and I
[2:25:27] Heat. Heat.
[2:25:37] Heat. Heat.
[2:25:45] [Music]
[2:25:54] [Music]
[2:25:56] I heard about his
[2:25:59] mother
[2:26:04] to walk again and
[2:26:08] see
[2:26:11] Jesus come
[2:26:15] [Music]
[2:26:16] Somehow Jesus
[2:26:27] [Music]
[2:26:37] [Music]
[2:26:44] victory. Glory.
[2:26:49] &gt;&gt; I'd like to sing that chorus. I lift up
[2:26:52] your name. You know the risen lamb.
[2:26:57] I lift your name. Let's just end with a
[2:27:00] worship is one of my favorite courses of
[2:27:04] brother Hilderbrand led us in. I I got
[2:27:07] carried away with it at time. Just think
[2:27:14] Lord, I live
[2:27:17] your name.
[2:27:20] [Music]
[2:27:27] [Music]
[2:27:31] Heat. Heat.
[2:27:45] [Music]
[2:27:51] [Music]
[2:27:53] My heart
[2:27:56] [Music]
[2:28:10] is
[2:28:11] You're
[2:28:34] [Music]
[2:28:45] [Music]
[2:28:50] Just before we sing it one more time,
[2:28:53] I'm touched. I'm so touched when I sing
[2:28:56] those words, my comforter,
[2:28:59] my king. And if you're here this morning
[2:29:03] and you have a need, God knows exactly
[2:29:06] what that need is. And he wants to meet
[2:29:09] it. He paid too great a price
[2:29:12] &gt;&gt; for you.
[2:29:14] &gt;&gt; You're his
[2:29:16] and he wants to take you to his kingdom.
[2:29:19] He said, prophet said he only asked for
[2:29:21] one thing in all of the Bible. He asked
[2:29:24] for your fellowship. And I had a
[2:29:27] scripture in my service and I'll give it
[2:29:30] to you in last. Jesus in his prayer,
[2:29:36] he said to the father,
[2:29:38] "I've lost none."
[2:29:40] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:29:41] &gt;&gt; All that you've given me, I lost none.
[2:29:44] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:29:45] &gt;&gt; Except the son of predition. It's the
[2:29:48] only one he lost.
[2:29:50] And he didn't lose him. He was ordained
[2:29:52] to that.
[2:29:54] Listen, friends.
[2:29:56] Please hear me. I didn't this service
[2:29:59] I've toiled over it for two solid weeks.
[2:30:03] You can ask my wife. I've been locked
[2:30:05] into my study. I was just nervous
[2:30:09] and I couldn't wait to
[2:30:13] release myself from it. But I want to
[2:30:16] say to you, this to me is a milestone
[2:30:19] message.
[2:30:21] And don't forget the evolution of
[2:30:23] Lucifer.
[2:30:25] And I I don't mean to put any damper on
[2:30:28] the service.
[2:30:30] But if he came to the supper table of
[2:30:33] our Lord Jesus Christ,
[2:30:36] if he stood at the right hand of
[2:30:38] Almighty God and watched creation take
[2:30:40] place, he's not afraid of these doors.
[2:30:44] &gt;&gt; He's not afraid of the doors of your
[2:30:45] house.
[2:30:47] He's not afraid of sitting at with you
[2:30:49] at the table and looking across the
[2:30:51] table. I'm not talking about people
[2:30:53] looking across the table. I'm talking
[2:30:54] about his presence right there. And when
[2:30:56] you ever sense or feel and sense that
[2:30:58] presence and have you sensed him drawing
[2:31:01] you away and making something glamorous
[2:31:04] of this world and drawing you away to
[2:31:06] that, you deny him. He's not worth it in
[2:31:10] the name of Jesus Christ. He's not worth
[2:31:12] it.
[2:31:13] &gt;&gt; He's a serpent. He's a diver trying to
[2:31:17] entice people away. He'll get into
[2:31:20] everything. And our prophet was
[2:31:22] absolutely truthful when he said he's in
[2:31:26] he's a god of the denomination.
[2:31:29] He's a god of all politics. He has every
[2:31:33] kingdom in his hand. He showed them to
[2:31:35] your Lord and Savior me when he stood
[2:31:38] eye to eye face to face with him. He's
[2:31:41] not ashamed of it. And it's up to you.
[2:31:43] That's why you've been equipped so
[2:31:45] completely and you want to stand up and
[2:31:48] aggressively say you have no part with
[2:31:50] me.
[2:31:54] &gt;&gt; I I'll hear none of that
[2:31:58] &gt;&gt; because the moment you receive it,
[2:31:59] there's an agenda behind that. Don't you
[2:32:02] hear it? You say, "My ears are stopped
[2:32:05] to that." Say, "Amen, friends."
[2:32:07] [Music]
[2:32:09] Make sure that you take it as a real
[2:32:11] solid warning and teaching and caution
[2:32:15] today. We have studied his movements.
[2:32:18] &gt;&gt; We've studied how he handles things. We
[2:32:21] study his his his kind of conversation
[2:32:24] and how he comes so subtle. Next thing
[2:32:26] you find out, he's your adversary.
[2:32:29] Next thing you find out, he's saying all
[2:32:31] kinds of slanderous things and even
[2:32:33] causing you to feel slanderous about
[2:32:35] yourself. That's the enemy.
[2:32:38] &gt;&gt; What he's done is neutralized you.
[2:32:41] &gt;&gt; We're not here. And the and the prophet
[2:32:43] speaks about him paralyzing our faith.
[2:32:47] I'm standing here as an old warrior. I'm
[2:32:49] not going to allow him to paralyze my
[2:32:51] faith.
[2:32:53] And I'll do everything in my power to
[2:32:55] see it doesn't paralyze yours.
[2:32:58] &gt;&gt; And there isn't a soul here I don't want
[2:33:00] to see. Come with us. Come with me to my
[2:33:02] father's house.
[2:33:04] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:33:06] Hallelujah.
[2:33:08] &gt;&gt; God bless you, Brother Edwin. Brother
[2:33:09] Edwin's rejoicing.
[2:33:11] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:33:13] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:33:15] Glory to God. We're going to sit across
[2:33:18] the table from one another, brother
[2:33:20] Edward. Glory to God. And rejoice
[2:33:24] through all eternity.
[2:33:26] &gt;&gt; Isn't it blessed, friends? Isn't he
[2:33:29] wonderful?
[2:33:31] &gt;&gt; Isn't he wonderful?
[2:33:34] Amen.
[2:33:36] Just notice Matthew and Sonda Adele's
[2:33:41] son there. Stand there. Heard about you
[2:33:43] being baptized.
[2:33:45] Wonderful.
[2:33:47] &gt;&gt; Take up the soldier. Take up the war
[2:33:50] swore sword and take up the battle.
[2:33:53] Hallelujah. We need some young men. Are
[2:33:56] you young men ready for it? Good. See, I
[2:33:59] said good before you said amen.
[2:34:02] Hallelujah. Let's just sing it one more
[2:34:03] time. Brother Tim, if you would close in
[2:34:05] prayer.
[2:34:12] [Music]
[2:34:18] Yeah.
[2:34:20] [Music]
[2:34:26] [Music]
[2:34:32] The
[2:34:36] am
[2:34:42] [Music]
[2:34:56] &gt;&gt; I'm just going to say one thing before
[2:34:57] we bow our heads in a word of prayer. I
[2:34:59] wasn't thinking of it till I just
[2:35:01] stepped up to the pulpit.
[2:35:03] Brother Ed said that he had only
[2:35:05] mentioned this to a handful of people
[2:35:07] over the years and I realized as I was
[2:35:10] sitting there I was one of the handful
[2:35:12] and I didn't know why.
[2:35:15] Many years ago, I heard that testimony
[2:35:18] and then as I was in Switzerland,
[2:35:22] Brother Ed told it to me again.
[2:35:25] And then I heard it tonight the third or
[2:35:27] today the third time. And I'll just say
[2:35:30] it was exactly the same every time.
[2:35:35] &gt;&gt; I'm so thankful that God has witnesses.
[2:35:40] Amen.
[2:35:41] &gt;&gt; Believers don't need uh some kind of
[2:35:44] assurance to believe.
[2:35:46] &gt;&gt; But what we got this morning was another
[2:35:48] weapon in our hands
[2:35:50] &gt;&gt; to use against the enemy.
[2:35:53] &gt;&gt; Let's just thank God for it this
[2:35:54] morning. Heavenly Father,
[2:35:58] Lord, we're so grateful
[2:36:01] &gt;&gt; for all of the gifts that you have put
[2:36:03] in the body.
[2:36:05] &gt;&gt; Your body, Lord, that you have redeemed
[2:36:07] by your own blood. Amen.
[2:36:10] &gt;&gt; You have not forsaken us, Lord.
[2:36:12] &gt;&gt; You have given us all things that is
[2:36:14] necessary.
[2:36:15] &gt;&gt; And Lord, this morning, you have
[2:36:17] anointed your servant to speak some
[2:36:20] things. And we saw, Lord, with our own
[2:36:22] eyes how much these meant to our dear
[2:36:26] brother Ed, Lord. And Lord, these are
[2:36:29] things that he has held in his heart for
[2:36:31] years. And Lord, that you have given him
[2:36:34] personally. And now you have led him to
[2:36:36] share them not just with the body
[2:36:38] locally here but out over the internet
[2:36:41] and all of those that will watch the
[2:36:43] service in the days to come just to let
[2:36:46] them know Lord that these things are
[2:36:48] true.
[2:36:49] &gt;&gt; They are yay and amen. And Lord you
[2:36:52] didn't owe us these things but Lord in
[2:36:55] your grace you have provided us these
[2:36:57] things. And so we pray that you will
[2:37:00] just take this service and that Lord,
[2:37:02] you will send a special anointing upon
[2:37:04] it as everyone would listen to it in the
[2:37:06] days ahead. And Lord, may the anointing
[2:37:09] that is present here in our midst this
[2:37:11] morning, Lord, may you just take it and
[2:37:14] deliver your children from every snare,
[2:37:17] every trap, every onslaught of the
[2:37:20] enemy, every reasoning idea that the
[2:37:23] enemy would try to bring against your
[2:37:25] children. In the name of Jesus Christ,
[2:37:28] we claim the victory this morning and we
[2:37:31] accept it for the glory of the kingdom
[2:37:34] of God. Bless brother Bisll. We saw how
[2:37:37] much he was moved this morning.
[2:37:38] Strengthen him. And Lord, may your peace
