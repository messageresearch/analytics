========================================
There's a land that is fairer than day. And by faith we can see it all. For the father who waits over the way to prepare us a dwelling place in the sea by we shall be on that Oh, in the sea thall.

He shall be on that beautiful sh in the sea by we shall be on that beautiful soul to our fle we will offer our pray of praise. For the glorious kingom is and the blessing in the sweet by we shall be on the show in the sweet I And we shall be on that beautiful shore. &gt;&gt; Amen. Going to be there. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; I'd like to also sing number 468. Had it not been, you know, the only way we could we could get to that shore is because of our Lord that died for us. just reading in in the family altar, I guess it was. Brother Brandon was saying, "Well, I I sure wouldn't want to try and get to heaven on our own merits." And it was something actually to hear him say, "Wouldn't want to try and get to heaven on my preaching. I wouldn't want to try to get to heaven on my visions." I thought, "Well, if if he couldn't do it, how how are we ever going to how are we ever going to see that land? It's it's only through Christ." Amen. So, that's why we come this morning. Just focus on him. Let's all stand as we sing it. Oh, had it not been for a place called Mount of Calvary, had it not been for Jesus and forever my soul. Glor of Jesus. And forever my soul for Happy for Jesus and forever my soul. I am redeemed with a power. Oh Jesus has changed my whole life. If anybody just I am telling I am I just I am I am I am my will. Jesus has changed my whole life. If anybody asks you just who I am telling I am. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I'm going to ask at this time if brother David Bernoff you'd come and lead us in a word of prayer. Amen. We're so glad we can approach the throne of God and with that on our lips we are redeemed. Amen. we can come boldly in his presence this morning. Brother Dave, if you comeless, let's bow our heads. Heavenly Father, I'm so thankful, Lord, that I can lift up my voice and say, I am redeemed, Father. And the prophet of God's taught us that our body will come subject to our confession, Lord. We confess this morning, Lord, that we are redeemed by the blood of the lamb, Lord. &gt;&gt; And Father, we like our brother was saying earlier, we know it's not on our merits, Lord Jesus. If there's a word that just keeps getting bigger and bigger to me, Father, and it's grace, &gt;&gt; grace, grace, grace, Father, Lord, we realize none of us are going to make it in this flesh, Lord. It's it's solely trusting in the work of Calvary, Father. And yet, Lord, we want to do what we can in this life to live a life worthy of the gospel, Father. So, Lord, we're here to hear your word once more. We pray that you will bless your servant who's waited on you. We've tried to prepare our own hearts, Father. We're we want to enter your courts with praise and thanksgiving because you are worthy, Lord. So bless us in divine presence. &gt;&gt; Take this meeting under your divine control Lord and let no one go out of this building without feeling the touch of God in their lives. We I pray father in Jesus name. Amen. &gt;&gt; Sing it one more time before we have our seats. I am redeemed. Heat. Heat. Heat. Heat. Heat. I am tell I am free. Amen. You can have your seats. Sister Melissa Snow has a special for us this morning. If she'd come at this time. Want to greet everyone that's here and those that are joining with us on the internet and on the phone hookup.

Free free from this world of sin. Oh, I've been washed in the love of Jesus before again. Hallelujah. I'm save my wonderful way. I'm glad I found now he could bring me out and show me the way. For a long time I tra my heart was so heavy and I said go then I heard about Jesus wonderful I found out he could bring me his saving power. Oh, thank God. Thank God I am free. I'm free. Free of this world of sin. I've been washed in the blood of Jesus. I've been born again. Hallelujah. In my wonderful way, I'm glad I bow down the rain. Show me your way. Like a bird out of prison has taken its flight. like climb and that God gave back his son like fortune and I found out how he could bring me out to his holy name. Thank God I am free. We s Jesus be born again. Hallelujah. Save by wonderful grace. He will bring me out. Show me the way. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Glad to be in the house of God. &gt;&gt; Amen. Come with expectation. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Then God will certainly see that you're not disappointed. &gt;&gt; If you put in for a small order, that's what you get. &gt;&gt; But we ask largely, &gt;&gt; then that's what we'll get. Amen. God bless you. You may be seated. I'm just going to make a couple of uh announcements. First, the deacons have asked me to uh make more clear regarding the um announcement which we made uh regarding prayer requests rather than bringing them here and having us read them. Uh but they wanted to know and I guess there were some questions to them. Are are the people that are not well here able to be prayed for? Oh my goodness. Absolutely. That's what we're here for. And you're come and be prayed for. All it was was concerning long writtenout requests and we're reading them and reading them service after service. So we said that bring a cloth. Bring an anointed cloth. bring a bring something that you would like to have prayed over and we'll pray for it here. And uh I I think maybe just writing out a request comes a lot easier. And uh I I noticed since we made that request, we haven't had a single handkerchief. And that's what the Bible says. So, if you if you're really burdened and you really want to have somebody prayed for that's not here, you'd like to send something to them and have them have have a a cloth or anointed cloth prayed for over, then that's what we'll do here. Because I noticed brother Brandham says on the tapes, we've got all these anointed. We got these claws and these handkerchiefs and aprons and whatever more and they took from the bodies of the apostles and and gave those claws and people were healed. And so I just want to go back to the pattern. I think that's fine. I really think that's fine. When we were a lot smaller and it is actually this isn't this isn't anything sudden at all. has been really on my mind for a long time. And I'm rather slow to move and do things sometimes. But Moses was slow. Brother Brandham said he was slow. So I'm in good company. We'll all be slow a wee bit. Don't want to be too slow preaching. However, we take too much time. Uh so I hope that that is clear. We we're just happy to pray with anybody that's here physically that's not well. You feel free as always to come and be prayed for. And this is the house of deliverance. Not only a house of worship, a house of deliverance. And I quite frankly am a very firm believer that he confirmed his word with signs following. And if the word is being preached, you should expect an answer from God. Don't come here not expecting to receive from God. You should come expecting to receive whatever your need is. Amen. Going to be turning to the word in a few minutes, but there's a verse of a a song, a very common song at Calvary, which we all know. And uh uh the last verse, we're just going to sing the chorus and the last verse. And then the chorus, the last verse says, "Oh, the love that drew salvation's plan. Oh, the grace that brought it down to man. Oh, the mighty gulf that God did span at Calvary." And we're coming up to Easter now. We got a flyer in the mail and perhaps you did too. It was from Jehovah's Witnesses. And they were making a an announcement. The greatest man, the death of the greatest man that ever lived. And I had glanced it over, but they didn't say anything about his resurrection. Might have something to do with what they believe. I don't know. I have some pretty good idea. But we're not celebrating a death only. We're celebrating a resurrection. We're not just not just the death, but it's the life that we're celebrating. And it was a life it was a body that couldn't corrupt. It was a life that couldn't stay in the tomb. And it's a life that's been passed on. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Oh, the love that drew salvation's plan. And oh, the grace that brought it down to man. This is very, very much in line with what I want to speak about today. And so, I've got to try to capture capture your thoughts early. Would ask you to be very focused and for me, help me. All right, you do that. It'll really help me. God bless your brother Tony. Haven't even been shaking brother Tony's hands at Rebecca since I've been back. And Amen. Nice to have everybody here. Oh, the love that through salvation plan. Oh, the grace that brought it down to land. Oh, the might of God is at mercy. There was great and grace was free. And there was multip we sing the last verse once again. All the love from salvation plan. Oh down to earth mighty God. Grace was free. There was multip Let's thank him, shall we? How gracious, how wonderful you are, Lord. We're thinking of this time of the year especially, Lord, the time of you entering in and the people were praising and worshiping and throwing their garments down, waving palms and a short time later crying, "Crucify! Crucify!" But there was no great voice or shouting except the angels rejoicing when you raised came out of the tomb and began to make yourself known. And today we're here to give you thanks, Lord Jesus. How thankful we are that you have made yourself known. Almighty God, by the Holy Spirit, you have sent the spirit of revelation. and you've sent the anointing upon us that we have been given eyes to see. And we thank you for what we see. We thank you, Lord, for the things that you'll still show us. And we pray that you will magnify yourself amongst us, oh God. I pray that you will demonstrate your power. Bind every evil spirit, every hindering spirit. Lord, I pray you'll loose, oh God, our our minds that seem so so encumbered sometime. I pray that you'll remove all the weights, oh God, and the things that so easily be satisfather in the name of Jesus. Give liberty to your word, I pray. Give uncction to it. Let the Holy Spirit be the speaker, I pray. And may each person receive what they have need of. Bless all that are with us, Father, streaming at this moment. May it not just be a stream of our my voice, but may there be a stream of the Holy Spirit, the very presence of the divine one coming into their rooms and into their places of worship. In Jesus Christ's name we ask it. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Good morning. &gt;&gt; I'll invite you to take your Bibles and turn to John's Gospel, the first chapter. And we're going to be reading such a familiar scripture starting with verse one down to verse 5 and then we'll read verse 14. Keep your Bibles open because we're turning to other uh brief scriptures after this. In the beginning was the word and the word was with God and the word was God. The same was in the beginning with God. All things were made by him and without him was not anything made that was made. In him was life and the life was the light of man. And the light shineth in darkness, and the darkness comprehended it not. Down to verse 14. And the word was made flesh and dwelt among us, and we beheld his glory, the glory as of the only begotten of the father, full of grace and truth. Down to verse 18. No man hath seen God at any time. The only begotten son, which is in the bosom of the father, he hath declared him. Turn to chapter 8 if you would please and verse 42. Jesus said unto them, "If God were your father, you would love me, for I proceeded forth and came from God." Oh, the grace that brought it down to man. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; For I proceeded forth and came from God. Neither came I of myself, but he sent me. &gt;&gt; Turn to chapter 20. In verse 21, he just showed them his hands in his sight after the resurrection. Then said Jesus to them again, "Peace be unto you, as my father hath sent me, even so send I you." And when he had said this, he breathed on them and said unto them, Receive ye the Holy Ghost as my father hath sent me said, I proceeded forth from God. &gt;&gt; And now he's saying after his resurrection, as my father hath sent me, &gt;&gt; even so send I you. And when he had said this, &gt;&gt; he breathed on them and said, "Receive ye the Holy Ghost. You may be seated." The scripture tells us also Peter preaching and soon after this experience and they'd received the Holy Spirit. He's telling the people how that God anointed Jesus of Nazareth with the Holy Ghost and with power, who went about doing good and healing all that were oppressed of the devil, for God was with him. Whenever we read John 1, it always confronts a minister with a tremendous challenge because we're starting in the beginning. In the beginning was the word and from the beginning you can go anywhere. It's so vast. It's so such an expanse of of place to go. It's always a little bit of a challenge to where do we go from here in the beginning. But I want to I want to focus our thoughts because I've been speaking the last two Sundays on anointed for rapture. So I want to tie together I want to continue with this subject of anointing. And in the first message, I brought the uh process of anointing and how it was an eastern it was in the eastern culture and I I took it on the physical side and how the first time anointing really comes in. God actually referred to Jacob anointing or it doesn't even say he anointed but he poured oil upon the pillar that he had slept on. It was stones stones that he had made for a pillow. And it was at that time he had that dream and he saw the angels ascending and descending and the ladder was on earth but it stretched into heaven. And he had that dream and he was so impacted by that dream, so affected by that dream and the presence that it left him with. He said, "This is Bethl. This is the gate of heaven." and he called it Bethl which is a house of God. And he was so affected by that that was the first instance he made an altar or raised up those stones that he'd slept on and used as a pillow and he poured oil upon them. And then God later reminded him and God used the word the pillar that thou dst anoint and the and the vow that you made and he made the vow if you'll be with me. And so that was the first instance of the anointing. I just take you quickly through it. And then God told Moses then later now it's it's the abraham's children. So he told Moses, "Make oil and make it fragrant oil. Make it for anointing oil and you'll make it fragrant." And then later he told them, "Anoint the priests, the sons of Aaron." And then later he anoint Aaron, the high priest, and anoint the altar and anoint the things that are in the tabernacle. And it just began to ex expand in its understanding and meaning. And the people understood because they had used that they used that even in in in their daily life. I won't say daily life but they were acquainted with the act of anointing but now it was taking a whole spiritual becoming very very sacred. And to the Hebrews they understood that anointing in the sacred sense when something was being anointed was being consecrated and the and the fact the very act of the anointing upon the individual especially when it was on an individual. their understanding was, and this is really fundamental to the message this morning as it was to the last two messages, but I I want to really nail this down is because God in his people, which were the Hebrews, they understood that when something was anointed in the in another realm, in the divine realm, they understood that something from God was being transferred from the divine one to that individual. And so now you want to think of this transferral because the message this morning I want to consider this incredible transferral that from the beginning in the beginning was the word. I want to start from the beginning or from the eternal one transferal from him came the word in the beginning was the word but in the very beginning there there was God alone the prophet describes him I'm not going to spend a lot of time in it but he was alone God by himself and from him came the logos or the word logos simply the Greek term for word. And then that word came and was made flesh that was transferred on further down. Oh, the grace that brought it down to man. And now it's it's a transferral and it came on down into man and from Christ into spirit form and from spirit form into a people. It's a great operation that God had in his mind. That is the that that's why we have that idea or that concept of the anointing. And this was the concept they had that when something was anointed, it was something all the way from the divine one through some process that God had in his mind to bring it and and transferring something that was actually divine, holy, sacred to that individual. &gt;&gt; Amen. Ignatius say said this for there is one God who made himself manifest through Jesus Christ his son who is his logos proceeding from his silence saying Ignatius is bringing the thought that God was silent but now he brings forth a voice he brings forth a sound through Jesus Christ. This process, I don't know if God was silent or not, but that is what Ignatius had said. Jesus said, "I've proceeded from God." And when he used the word proceeded, it isn't just that I've come forth from God or that I've come forth. To proceed, we say, "Well, to proceed is to make progress, to go forward, and to have motion, proceed." But when Jesus used the word, it was not just to say that there was movement, but it was to identify where the movement commenced. And that is why he said, I have proceeded and come forth from God. &gt;&gt; He identified where he he came from. I proceeded forth and came forth from God. And as the Father hath sent me, so send I you. We are to know emphatically where we came from. &gt;&gt; We didn't originate We didn't originate in our mother's womb. &gt;&gt; We didn't originate in our father's sperm. We originated in the mind of God. &gt;&gt; We came from God. Jesus knew that. Jesus never identified himself. say, "I come from Mary's womb. &gt;&gt; I come from God." &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; It's a great plan, a great operation. I've come from God and I go to God. It is that I've proceeded. I have come from one place to another. I've come down. I've made my appearance. And thus Jesus was anointed. Brother Brandham said in and show us the father in Tom's service on Wednesday night. I was so so very blessed and I know that you were as well. And he was speaking on show us the father and it sufficeth us. And I thought it was just really marvelous how he was bringing the thought from it sufficeth us. It will be sufficient. It's enough. That's what I need. And whatever our situation was, just to repeat a little of his words, whatever whatever your situation is today, he used it for Wednesday, I'll use it for this morning. Whatever wherever you're at spiritually or materially or physically or any other way, BUT JUST SHOW US THE FATHER AND THAT'LL be sufficient. All we need to do IS SEE HIM. &gt;&gt; ALL YOU need to do, you don't need to see me. You don't need to see your friends, your peers. You don't need to see who you're have so much wonderful fellowship with in the church. You need to see him AND THAT'LL SUFFICE. THAT'LL BE SUFFICIENT. &gt;&gt; WE NEED TO say that's all that I really need. And in that message, show us the father. Uh brother Brandham, he said, let's take a little trip. He's he's he's actually making this a a drama. Let's take a little trip to see who he was. And he said, "You can find out whether God was in his son or not. Take a little trip." And he goes a 100 million years before there was ever a star in the sky. There was God. And God was there then. And I'm I'm abbreviating some of this. He says, "And then the logos," and don't get lost when we just say that the word now he's giving the process. And then the logos went out from God which was Christ. The anointing that went out and I haven't been able to escape this for the last weeks. The logos, this great eternal being, the divine one, the God that fills all times, the God that's so mysterious that you couldn't begin to understand him. I couldn't begin to understand him. But he wants to be known. He wants to reveal himself. He wants to have fellowship. Brother Brandham said Jesus when he was here on earth, he only asked for one thing, FOR OUR FELLOWSHIP. WHY? BECAUSE HE CAME FORTH FROM GOD. HE PROCEEDED FROM GOD. Had the he was the attributes of God. He wanted fellowship &gt;&gt; if we could grasp that. And so he came forth from God and the logos went out of God which was Christ the anointing that went out. So no wonder the Jews or the Hebrews had that understanding that something was being transferred. I've looked into what some other scholars have said about the anointing and about the logos and about the great eternal one and I can tell you that no one and I have I've read some things that make your head spin a bit but when a prophet comes he can say it in such a way so that you can you can actually grasp a hold of it. You've got something that you can sink your teeth into. you can get around it with your mind. And even though it may jar us a little bit, yet it it it it captivates you. It's so wonderful. And so when he begins to say the anointing that went out and now he said, "No, man." He said, "We're standing on the banister watching the creation come into existence and see whether he was his son, whether say whether he's his son now." But now watch this transferal. The logos, the word went out from this great being. Brother Bram says another place perhaps a little light. We see it. It starts to circle out and it's the logos. It's something coming out from God. But now what's in the mind of God? Because now that is why the Jews had this this something is being transferred. And what's this transferral? Now it comes in what we have in the scripture. In the beginning, in the beginning was the word. But this the Bible says tells us in the beginning and God said let there be and we find now that it begins to transfer the transferal comes into a creation. And I don't want to go in uh spend a lot of time on it but he begin to transfer life. He chose and selected this planet that we're on. &gt;&gt; Oh my. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; This molten mass, this little speck of nothing as it were. The prophet calls it a clinker that perhaps flew off the sun. This little here we're sitting today and we're all part of what came out of the ashes, out of the remains. And God was making in his mind was making a structured person. He was laying out his 2x4s like a contractor making the uh calcium and the potassium and whatever more goes into make up our bodies that were sitting in here today. God had us in his mind billions of years ago. If there is such a thing, do you believe that? &gt;&gt; And now he's bringing it. And now he begins to transfer himself. He begins to transfer life. And the and the prophet said he he spoke because there were seeds down there. The seeds were buried. Let there be light because there had to be something that the light could re that the seeds could respond to. And so light comes. Light is born in a region that is that this earth can respond to. and he's chosen this earth and he's actually anointing the earth as it were because he's pouring out he's pouring out the horn of his creative power upon the earth this earth and then he says let the earth bring forth WHAT'S HE DOING HE'S TRANSFERRING SOMETHING THAT WENT OUT FROM HIMSELF it went out of THE BOSOM OF ALMIGHTY GOD WAS THE LOGOS it was the word and the word spoke. NOW, I DOUBT IF HE SPOKE ENGLISH. I DOUBT IF HE SPOKE HEBREW. I don't know what he said. I DON'T KNOW HOW IT WAS. BUT IT WAS AN UTTERANCE. LET THE EARTH BRING FORTH. AND THE EARTH BEGAN TO BRING FORTH. Something from this logos was transferred to the very earth. And out of the earth began to grow herb and trees and all manner OF THINGS AND FLOWERS of the field. And it IT IT JUST BLOSSOMED WITH A MASSIVE AMOUNT OF LIFE BECAUSE IT WAS COMING OUT OF THE BOSOM OF GOD. &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; AND THAT WASN'T SUFFICIENT. HE HAD MORE in his bosom. And so HE SAID, "LET THE WATERS BRING FORTH AND THE WATERS came alive." I don't care whether it took a million, 10 million or 100 million years. Had nothing to do. I don't care HOW IT HAPPENED, BUT IT HAPPENED. AND THAT'S HOW IT happened because God said, "Let it bring forth." And the animal kingdom came forth and higher and higher and higher came this because God is transferring. &gt;&gt; IT'S LIKE HE'S ANOINTING THE EARTH WITH LIFE. HE'S TRANSFERRING UPON IT, pouring out the horn of his life. &gt;&gt; And then he must have his own image there. and he makes a man. Let us make man in our image. And when he had done that, there was no no one to till the ground. Man was made an image of God. God is a spirit, Jesus said. So he must make a man to till the ground and to care for the earth in the garden. And he brings forth and forms him out of the earth, out of the elements. And there was a body. And then the scripture says, "And he breathed into man into his nostrils, and man became a living soul." That is different from just spoken word. He spoke his word and the earth brought forth. He spoke his word and the waters brought forth. He spoke his word and all of the life came forth. All the levels of life came forth, but he never breathed into them. It was this breath that separated the man from all other. Even though it all came out of God, came out of the very bosom of God. He's expressing himself, but he breathed into him and man became a living soul. And Jesus when they had heard his word, they heard the spoken word AND THEY HAD THE SPOKEN WORD OF THE PROPHETS, BUT IT REQUIRED SOMETHING FURTHER. &gt;&gt; And he told them, "As the father hath sent me, as a FATHER HAVE SENT ME, so send you." Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; As I have come out of the father, AS I HAVE proceeded out FROM GOD, THAT'S HOW I AM SENDING YOU. &gt;&gt; I CAME FROM THE BOSOM OF GOD. AND YOU ARE JUST AN EXTENSION OF THAT COMING FORTH. AND NOW I SEND YOU EXACTLY AS I HAVE BEEN SENT. I SEND YOU. I came OUT FROM GOD. I AM A I'VE BEEN TRANSFERRED FROM GOD, OUT OF GOD, OUT OF HIS VERY BOSOM, OUT OF HIS VERY ATTRIBUTES. I'VE BEEN SENT OUT. AND AS I'VE BEEN SENT, I SEND YOU. &gt;&gt; You have no more to You have no more right to doubt that than Jesus had to doubt that he came out of God. &gt;&gt; You have no right to doubt that. AND WHEN HE HAD SAID THIS, WHEN HE HAD SAID THIS, he breathed on them &gt;&gt; AND SAID, "RECEIVE YE THE HOLY GHOST." IT WASN'T SUFFICIENT EVEN TO SAY IT, JUST TO SAY IT. THEY KNEW THAT THEY MUST GO AND TARRY. They must go and wait. And there WOULD BE SOMETHING THAT WOULD LITERALLY TAKE PLACE. AND WITH AND there was a rushing mighty wind AND THAT FILLED THE WHOLE PLACE. AND THEY WERE ALL FILLED WITH THE HOLY GHOST. AND AT THAT MOMENT, THAT 120 WAS THE ONLY 120 ON THE EARTH THAT WAS DIFFERENT FROM ALL OTHER MANKIND. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; EVEN AS ADAM WAS DIFFERENT FROM EVERYTHING ELSE, FROM ALL OTHER, ALL OTHERS HAD LIFE. BUT THESE HAD A DIFFERENT KIND OF LIFE. THE TRANSFERRAL OF GOD HIMSELF, OF HIS OWN BREATH, OF HIS OWN LIFE, OF HIS OWN NATURE, OF HIS OWN CHARACTER come into the people. &gt;&gt; And that IS STILL IN FORCE TODAY. And that is what's needed amongst the believers OF THIS MESSAGE IS THE TRANSFERAL. NOT JUST TO HEAR A TAPE, NOT JUST TO READ A BOOK, BUT TO HAVE THE AUTHOR OF THE BOOK TO BREATHE INTO YOU &gt;&gt; the breath. And I want to tell you whatever you think of me or whatever anyone who ever hears this service hears what I have to say and this I believe that when God when he spoke and creation came and so on then he began to speak directly to a people in the mountain. God speaking to the people and the people came to the prophet. Moses was already a prophet. They came to Moses their prophet and said, "Don't have God speak to us. &gt;&gt; We can't bear this. LET GOD SPEAK TO YOU and you speak to us." And so God agreed. He complied. AND NOW THAT WAS THE FIRST INSTANCE. Now we have a vessel. God decreed that a vessel, a human vessel shall be his it will be his uh uh conduit is as I if I can say it that way. It will be his his his METHOD HIS PROCESS TO CONVEY his breath &gt;&gt; FROM HIMSELF TO THE PEOPLE. AND SO HE WOULD HAVE HIS PROPHETS, HIS SEERS. &gt;&gt; Sometimes they were called seers. And again, I refer to brother Tom's message on Wednesday. Whenever God would do something to manifest himself, a remarkable way he WOULD HAVE A SEAR TO IDENTIFY THAT changing of his mask. Amen. &gt;&gt; And when WE GRASP AT THE PRINCIPLE, THEN WE CAN TRANS then we can in our minds take that principle and move it up to the present time. &gt;&gt; GOD HE HAD TO NOW HE HAD IS PART OF HIS PRO AND HE KNEW THAT BEFORE THE FOUNDATION OF the world that this would take place AND SO NOW GOD RAISES UP PROPHETS AND THE PROPHETS BECOME HIS INSTRUMENT THROUGH WHICH HIS BREATH WILL FLOW. &gt;&gt; AMEN. IT'S NOT THROUGH THEIR MIND. IT IS SIMPLY THROUGH THEIR MOUTH. AND MOSES SPOKE ONE LANGUAGE. BROTHER BRANDHAM SPOKE ANOTHER LANGUAGE. THE MESSENGER SPOKE OTHER LANGUAGES. PAUL SPOKE ANOTHER LANGUAGE. HE SPOKE MORE THAN ONE LANGUAGE. BUT IT ALL WAS THE SAME THING. GOD TRANSFERRING &gt;&gt; WHAT WAS COMING OUT OF HIM. WHAT THE HEBREWS CALL AN ANOINTING. GOD. He in he impregnated his word with his life. &gt;&gt; YOU COULD NOT SEPARATE THE LIFE OF GOD FROM THE WORD OF GOD. YOU COULD SAY THE WORD IS HIS LIFE AND THE LIFE OF HIS is his word. It's synonymous. It's one AND THE SAME. SO GOD INFUSED, HE IMPREGNATED HIS WORD WITH HIS OWN LIFE AND THEN BREATHED THAT WORD THROUGH HIS PROPHETS. IT WAS ACTUALLY THE BREATH OF GOD. &gt;&gt; So when YOU RECEIVE THAT, NOT JUST WHEN you read it with your eyes or hear it with your physical ears, BUT WHEN YOU RECEIVE IT IN YOUR SOUL, THEN THAT LIFE, THAT'S WHY JESUS SAID THE WORD IS THE SEED. IT HAS WITHIN IT, IT HAS ALL THE COMPOUND UH UH UH ALL THE COMPOUNDS THAT'S ESSENTIAL FOR BRINGING FORTH WHATEVER THAT WORD IN ITS SEASON SAID. AMEN. &gt;&gt; And that is why Jesus could take in Luke 4 and say, "The spirit of the Lord hath anointed me TO PREACH THE GOSPEL, TO HEAL THE BROKENHEARTED, TO LOOSE THE PRISONERS BECAUSE THAT WORD WAS FOR HIM, AND TO PREACH THE ACCEPTABLE YEAR OF THE LORD. THIS DAY IS THIS SCRIPTURE FULFILLED IN YOUR EARS." AND THAT PROMISED WORD WHICH WAS PROPHESIED BY MALACHI AND BY ISAIAH WAS IN HIM AND IT CAME FORTH TO LIFE IN HIM. &gt;&gt; HE RECEIVED IT. &gt;&gt; HE DID NOT RECEIVE A MESSAGE FOR A RAPTURE, taking a whole group of PEOPLE INTO A BODY CHANGE. BUT THE PROPHET, THE PROPHET uh Paul, HE GAVE THAT PROPHETIC SEED AND GOD BREATHED OUT FROM HIM IN SEED FORM THOSE PROMISES THAT WE SHALL NOT ALL SLEEP, BUT WE SHALL ALL BE CHANGED. I ASK YOU, WHO WAS THAT FOR? WHO WAS THAT INTENDED FOR? WHO WHO WHO WAS WHAT WHAT WAS THE PURPOSE OF GOD SPEAKING THAT? WHO IS IT FOR? AND THEN COMES A SEER, A PROPHET SEER IN THE END TIME AND SHOWS A SIGN OF THE RESURRECTION AND SAYS, "NOW IS THE TIME. THIS IS THE SEASON, MY FRIENDS. Whether I see it or not, YOU WANT TO BELIEVE THAT WITH ALL YOUR HEART. TO BELIEVE IT IS TO RECEIVE IT. TO BELIEVE IT IS TO BE THE RECIPIENT. TO DOUBT IT IS DEATH. TO DOUBT IT, YOU'LL STILL GO TO CHURCH. TO DOUBT IT, YOU MAY STILL SPEAK IN TONGUES. TO DOUBT IT, YOU STILL PLAY IN A ORCHESTRA. TO DOUBT IT, YOU CAN STILL SING SONGS THAT HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH IT. &gt;&gt; YOU'LL MISS IT. &gt;&gt; BUT THAT WORD IS INFUSED. IT'S PREGNANTATED &gt;&gt; WITH THE rapture life. &gt;&gt; AND IT IN ITSELF ALREADY IS ANOINTED. You know, just little thoughts along the side in the Bible, God told them, "Anoint the altar, anoint it with oil." And they did. and had and because I can say the earth to me could couldn't find where brother Brandham said it but in my studies the earth to me was like God's altar because here on the earth doesn't say he poured out his spirit on the sun or poured out his spirit on the moon or poured out his spirit on Pluto or Jupiter or Saturn or other galaxies. We have no record. But his spirit moved over the face of the earth. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Moved. And the prophet said he cooed. &gt;&gt; He brooded. He cooed in love and he brooded upon the face of the earth. Why? Because he loved the water. NO. BECAUSE WHAT WAS IN THE EARTH? &gt;&gt; YOU WERE LAYING THERE. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. YOU WERE LAYING THERE. &gt;&gt; Do you believe that? Amen. &gt;&gt; And there's many that are asleep in the earth. And the same Holy Spirit is couping over this earth waiting ON THAT PROMISE. I'M GOING TO BRING THEM FORTH. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. I'M GOING TO BRING THEM FORTH. &gt;&gt; WE SHALL not all sleep. But those that are asleep in Christ shall BE FIRST RAISED. THEY'LL FIRST BE RAISED. DO YOU KNOW ANYBODY THAT'S GOING TO BE RAISED? ARE YOU LOOKING FOR SOMEBODY THAT'S GOING TO BE RAISED? THEY'LL FIRST BE RAISED. HALLELUJAH. AND THEN WE WHICH ARE ALIVE AND REMAIN, HERE'S THE SEED. HERE'S THE SEED. SHALL BE CHANGED &gt;&gt; IN A MOMENT, IN A TWINKLING OF AN EYE. IS THAT YOUR promise &gt;&gt; that was in seed form and now we're in the manifestation part of it? AND WE'VE RECEIVED THE SIGN, RECEIVED THE PROPHET SEER who the breath of God could come through. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That is why that ministry is so different. And you know the altar also had to be sprinkled with blood. And this earth as God's altar was sprinkled with blood. his own blood. He says, "I'll make it new blood. I'll create blood again and it'll be sprinkled, spattered on the earth. I'll claim that little speck of dust out in its orbit." Friends, this would just be some star. And even scientists that try to understand try to understand this earth they try to understand these things try to understand our place in the universe and in the in the tens of billions billions of galaxies. If you go into it you just get lost. If you go into it as a believer you're bound to say God how great thou art. You're bound to say, "How did you ever find me? How are you aware of me that God should think of me? That God should be concerned that I'm a sinner that God should be concerned about my need. THAT GOD SHOULD BE CONCERNED. I HAVE A PAIN. I have a sickness. I HAVE A DISEASE. THAT GOD SHOULD BE SO CONCERNED. I'LL COME DOWN I'LL CONDESCEND DOWN AND I'LL MAKE A WAY WHERE YOU CAN BE FREE OF YOUR GUILT, FREE OF YOUR SIN, FREE OF YOUR DISEASE, FREE OF ALL THE GRACE THAT BROUGHT IT DOWN to man. I &gt;&gt; tell you what, friends, if I shut this service down right now and you didn't praise him, I'd say you'd be nigh unto a sinner. HOW CAN A HOW CAN A REDEEMED ONE HOLD THEIR PEACE? &gt;&gt; HOW CAN YOU FULLY UNDERSTAND WHAT HE DID AND BE AT PEACE AND BE SILENT? NO. GOD NOW HAS PUT SOMETHING IN THE PEOPLE. &gt;&gt; GOD DESIRES WORSHIP AND WE'RE HERE TO WORSHIP HIM. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. the concept or the understanding of the anointing even before the beginning and that's where I've brought you from in thought I've tried to bring you along and then I want to just give you uh another thought if you could for a moment. follow with me. You see Jesus saying, I proceeded forth from God. I would like you to see him as the branch coming forth from the stalk. And the Bible says of him, Isaiah speaking, he said, "And there shall come forth a rod," or the rod, the word in the Hebrews actually a branch. There shall come forth a branch or another meaning is a twig out of the stem which is the trunk or the stalk of Jesse and a branch shall grow out of his roots. Jesus was like in his coming here is like a a branch of Jesse a twig coming forth. And then Jesus would say, "I'm the true vine. My father's the husbandman." And if there's a true vine, something that is is very unique in Brother Brandham's ministry. And I I'm just giving this to you. I'm sewing this thought because you've run into it many, many times. And it has a great deal of meaning to me because I was when I was with brother Brandham, I was really quite I was distressed, I guess would be the right word at all. The anointed things that I saw took place and I made reference to them before. I heard prophecies that were not accurate did not happen and they were anointed and I couldn't understand it and great manifestations saw miracles and other things. I saw three deaf and dumb persons in a man's meeting and a small handful of people compared to brother Brandham's meetings or or Roberts's meetings or Tommy Hicks or Tommy Osburn or any of these other men. We always think of the big tents and the biggy big auditoriums, but this was out in the field out in the open. And over a period, I think of two or three days in two small towns, both in British Columbia. I saw three deaf and dumb persons prayed for by a man I still remember his name. I won't name it just now. And he was from California, a preacher. Only saw him then, never saw him again. He He took control of that demon and cast that deaf and dumb spirit out and had that person hear and speak right there at the platform. &gt;&gt; And I was about 15. I never forgot that. Anointed? &gt;&gt; Absolutely. And was that from God? Absolutely. It's from God. And I wouldn't ident fine man. But with all even today you think anointed singing. We hear anointed singing and anointed preaching and anointed because Jesus said in the last days in the last days it would be so close &gt;&gt; so as to deceive the very elect if possible. it was. So, it's going to be so close and you won't find it anywhere else. You just don't find it. But now, Brother Brandham brings false anointed ones and that has such a significant place in my life and my experience because I sat there on that log and had him when I raised the question and he said, "Have you heard my tape or my message on false anointed ones?" And I felt bad and I felt somewhat embarrassed that I had not heard it. I'd heard a few tapes but not many. And uh so I said no I haven't heard it. So then he went into the scriptures and in the scriptures one of the scriptures was in the last days sayith God I will pour out what is it pouring out. It's like an anointing. I will pour out my spirit upon all. And brother Brandon when he came to that he said I'll pour out my spirit upon and I said all. I answered because he waiting for the answer. I said all and he said a ll flesh but not all flesh is saved. &gt;&gt; I said that is correct. He said the wheat and the tears. You remember the parable? Yes. I said, he said, "You tell me what the wheat what caused the wheat to grow, what caused the wheat to rejoice, what caused what gave the wheat strength, and I'll tell you what the tears rejoiced in cuz they both had the same source." And he went through two more scriptures and then I tell you what, friends, it was like an explosion took place. And I also said to myself, I said to myself, I felt very very uh humbled because I said to myself, you have read those scriptures hundreds of times. Why haven't we why haven't I seen that before? And then I realized that the word coming in its season out of the right mouth had a different had a whole different power to it. And it's the same scripture. It just took on a whole new scope, a whole new meaning. &gt;&gt; And then when you get into false anointed ones, you'll find in several places you'll say, "Now, he was to this brother's place, and there's a a citrus tree, an orange tree, and in there is growing lemons and grapefruit, and tangelos, and several other fruits, but they're all citrus. and the branches are all growing out of this orange tree. And brother Brandham says, "Well, how is that? How can they all be manifesting these other things?" And he says, "Well, because that's what they are. That's the branch they are." Oh. He says, "So now next year, next year these will all grow oranges." He said, "Oh no, &gt;&gt; no. The lemon branch will bring a lemon." And the tangelo will bring a tangelo and the grapefruit will bring IT EVEN NEXT YEAR. YES, it'll keep on bringing that. But it's drawing life from the vine. It's drawing life from the tree. And now this whole series of messages has actually erupted from this next phrase which he makes. And whether it is that service, whether it is anointed ones, false anointed ones, but he's he makes this statement. They have the life like that. But then his statement is, "But they're bearing false witness to the tree." &gt;&gt; And that's why I said the anointing that came out from God, the purpose of that is to bring a true evidence &gt;&gt; to the tree. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. SO WHEN JESUS CAME, &gt;&gt; HE COULD SAY I'M THE TRUE VINE &gt;&gt; BECAUSE HE WAS BRINGING FORTH A TRUE EVIDENCE, &gt;&gt; THE ANOINTING. HE SAID, "THE SPIRIT OF THE LORD IS UPON ME BECAUSE HE HATH ANOINTED ME." HE WAS ANOINTED NOT ONLY TO BRING EVIDENCE, BUT TO BRING A TRUE EVIDENCE OF THE ORIGINAL STOCK. AND MY BROTHER, my sister, YOU'RE ORDAINED. YOU ARE ORDAINED BY GOD. GOD'S PURPOSE TO BRING THIS MESSAGE IS TO LET IT COME INTO YOUR HEART AND TO ANOINT IT BY THE HOLY SPIRIT SO THAT YOU WILL BRING A TRUE EVIDENCE. &gt;&gt; A TRUE EVIDENCE. YOU'RE ANOINTED TO BRING FORTH A TRUE EVIDENCE of the original vine. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; That's why he SENT THIS WORD. WE'RE NOT JUST HERE TO BE ANOTHER CHURCH. WE'RE NOT JUST HERE TO BE IDENTIFIED as as a a some kind of a group of people. We have been ordained by God. WE'RE NOT HERE TO BRING FORTH A Baptist branch, a Pentecostal branch, a Catholic branch. THEY MAY ALL GET THEIR LIFE FROM THAT VINE. BUT there are those that come from an original twig, an original branch. AND THAT ORIGINAL BRANCH WILL ALWAYS BRING FORTH ORANGES. IT'LL BRING FORTH THE ORIGINAL LIFE. &gt;&gt; How many believe that? &gt;&gt; And that branch, that life has been ordained for the rapture because I came from God AND I RETURN BACK TO GOD. &gt;&gt; You've got to believe that. &gt;&gt; Do you believe that? &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. There shall come forth a branch. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; That's why Jesus could go on and say Jesus coming forth who was the word himself &gt;&gt; proceeded OUT FROM GOD. HE WAS THE BREATH of God. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; HE WAS NOT A PROPHET OF GOD. HE was the God prophet. Prophets of God were instruments through which the breath of God COULD COME. &gt;&gt; BUT JESUS CHRIST WAS THE WORD. HE WAS THE VERY BREATH OF GOD. &gt;&gt; IN HIM WAS LIFE. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. AND THAT LIFE WAS THE LIGHT OF MAN. &gt;&gt; BUT OTHER PROPHETS CAME AND THEY WERE INSTRUMENTS THROUGH WHICH THE BREATH of God came was breathed through. AND THEN THAT'S WHY BROTHER BRANDON MAKES A DISTINCTION. HE says now he said when you hear that thus sayaith the Lord it's not me speaking. &gt;&gt; That's a different breath. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. You follow me? You know, just to make it clear. Jesus did not say some things, for example, that brother Brandham said. Brother Brandham could say, "Oh, I've just made so many mistakes." He's a man. I've made so many. You never hear Jesus saying, "I've made so many mistakes." Brother Bram said, "I was a sinner. I repented of my sins. You never hear Jesus say that. &gt;&gt; Jesus said, "My blood is drink indeed and my flesh is meat indeed." Brother Brandon couldn't say that. &gt;&gt; You understand? &gt;&gt; One was the logos himself and the other was a vessel of the logos. It's important to understand that because people go on both sides. Then some people use those maybe statements similar to mine and say, "Well, there was a difference in you only you only pay attention to what brother Brandham said when he said, "Thus sayith the Lord." I don't accept that. &gt;&gt; I don't accept that either. &gt;&gt; I probably should, you know, people have used that. Ministers have used that sadly because they want to go toodling off on their own direction. They have their own revelation and they end off way off in some wilderness. And the sad part is I wouldn't mind if they want to go riding off there but they take a whole group of people with them and it's really sad saying well you know try to indicate infer that the message is unreliable. The message isn't unreliable friends. It's an absolute to us. It is the revelation of God's word to us &gt;&gt; but it'll always harmonize with the word. &gt;&gt; Always harmonize with the word. Amen. &gt;&gt; And so my desire &gt;&gt; for the congregation here, my desire for this congregation is that we will bear and I've been I've been praying for you. I hope you've been praying for me. Praying for you as a congregation, appreciating you as a congregation. And the message I've just been listening to, testimony of a true witness. Brother Brandham has just lost his mother and I was with him just before that. and he had the vision of the hunt and everything. And then he explained to the people in another service right after his mother departed that God gave him that hunt to comfort him &gt;&gt; in what he was going to be facing. But when he comes in November of 61, I believe it is, he comes and he's just lost his mother. And that is he spends so much of the service on how how what he thought of his mother and what his mother meant to him and how she was just such a he goes back into her conversations that he had with her and then he began to thank the people you know and he I you can just see he becomes so melancholy and he becomes so expressive to the people. was like he's talking to them one on- one and tells them how much he loved them and and thank you for coming and sitting with mother and thank you for being there with me and being there for our time of grief and he goes on and on and on. and it takes a long time in the service, but he's preaching on a testimony of a true witness. And I'd like to say to you, I just pray my prayer to God for this congregation is we don't have another church to be our example. We don't have any other place to be our example. Our example must be a word messagebased example and live by that. and I say, "Oh, God, I wouldn't want to have labored all this 34, 35 years." And then and then end up with a say a group of people or a church, not worried about you so much as worried about, you know, the influence that the world has and the influence of our jobs and the influence just of of the whole civilization that we're we're we're forced to live in. The influence of your schools, young people, the influence of your friends, the influence of the fashion industry, the influence of the sports, the influence that is so infiltrates every part of our life. You can't even hardly move or turn around before you can feel that impact of that influence. Your neighbors and your work, people that you work with and all over. I pray that God will by his divine grace allow you, my precious brothers and sisters, my precious young people, that we will when all is said and done and you surely will stand also before him that you will hear his voice, well done. You have borne, you did bear a true evidence, &gt;&gt; of the tree of life. &gt;&gt; You bore a true evidence. You were not a false witness to this tree. You were a true witness to this tree. &gt;&gt; Amen. The Bible says, "Then said Jesus to them again, peace be unto you as I would like to say exactly as prec precisely as the Father hath sent me. I've proceeded out from God. I've come out of the bosom of God. As he came out, so have you come out. I want to take you back not just in some mental picture but in reality long before your greatgrandfathers and mothers and your lineage way way back to the many many countries that are represented here. Long before that listen to me you young people especially sitting here with your mother and dad. God bless them. how we thank God for godly parents. But long before that, if you could only see, if you could only recognize it, you're believing the words of your Lord Jesus as I came from God, as I've been sent, even sent with a purpose. Somebody I was just talking to in this congregation. I don't see them, but they're probably sitting here listening to me. I don't have permission to say this, but I'm going to say it. Been on my heart very, very much. I've been aware for some months God dealing with a man in this congregation very, very deeply. when he's out on a relaxation, he's carrying his Bible and I met him on occasion when he was on a relaxation on vacation. He was carrying his Bible, had his Bible in the vehicle and he starts to tell me about how God is speaking to him out of his out of the scriptures and he's weeping. He can't hold himself together and he's weeping. And I and I see now months have gone by and I've just seen a change transformation in this man. I had a conversation with him this last week, maybe two weeks ago, and he was driven to prayer. He said, "My house is busy. Children in the house, but he said, I found a place under the stairs and I've made a room where I can be alone with God." On another occasion, this isn't flash in the pan. This is not come up to the front and be prayed for and walk away and forget all about it. Another occasion just I'm being waked up early in the morning and I felt even sometimes in the night I just need to get out and pray and I start praying. He said I think I'll only pray for maybe a short time before I know it it's daylight and he has to work and he has to work hard. It's going week in week out week in week out. not long ago in the last few weeks. He's not preaching to his wife. He's not trying to bring anything down, bring her into subjection. He just concerned told me yesterday, "All I want to talk about, I just want to I want to be with you." He said, "I just want to talk about the Lord. I just want everything you can tell me about God." and his wife is in the house and has some kind of experience and God comes upon her and speaks to her and says to her Jesus Christ is in your husband. I said what is happening to you? There's a purpose in that. Now you must scan as it were to know the mind of God. what are you doing this for and what is the purpose? I said, there's someone else perhaps in the congregation you're to have an effect on. And I said, what I'm praying, I'm praying, oh God, let that be the experience not of one, &gt;&gt; but of others. I feel like God is doing something. I've had you speak. I've had you email. I've had phone calls. And I myself know the word is different. I know that God is doing something different. I'm hearing the other brothers minister and God is dealing with our congregation. If I was to go off the scene today, I'd want you to remember God is dealing with this congregation in a different way. &gt;&gt; You believe that? &gt;&gt; You feel it, don't you? You sense it. It's something deep within. &gt;&gt; You know what I believe it is? I believe it's the rapture word. I believe it's the anointed word for rapture. &gt;&gt; I believe that what God is doing is getting a people ready to leave. &gt;&gt; It's not just a song. It's not just a song getting ready to leave. &gt;&gt; BUT IT'S SOMETHING THAT'S TAKING PLACE THAT HAS TO DO SO. &gt;&gt; OUR EXAMPLES AREN'T OUT IN THE WORLD. IT'S NOT IN THE STREET. IT'S NOT IN THE MALL. IT'S NOT WHERE WE WORK. IT'S NOT IN THE SCHOOL. IT'S NOT IN THE COLLEGE. OUR EXAMPLE IS IN THE WORD AND THE WORD HAS CALLED US TO SUCH A A DEPTH IN HIM. AND I BELIEVE THAT THAT WORD WHICH CAME WAS BREATHED OUT OF GOD, CREATED THE CREATION OF THIS EARTH WHEN OUR BODIES WERE STILL IN THE SOIL AND SENT HIS WORD DOWN THROUGH HIS VESSELS THROUGH HIS PROPHETS, THE BREATH OF GOD TO THE PEOPLE IN SEED FORM. AMEN. &gt;&gt; THEN IT CAME TO ITS MANIFESTED FORM AND GOD SENT A MESSENGER IN THE END TIME PROPHET MESSENGER THROUGH WHOM HE COULD TRANSMIT THE VERY BREATH OF GOD. &gt;&gt; SO JESUS COULD SAY AS I HAVE BEEN SENT AS I HAVE BEEN SENT OF THE FATHER SO SEND I YOU. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. DOES THIS CONGREGATION UNDERSTAND WHAT'S IN MY SPIRIT AND SOUL TODAY? &gt;&gt; YOU HAVE BEEN SENT BY GOD. YOU DON'T LOOK BACK AT JUST WHERE YOU CAME FROM OR YOUR HERITAGE HERE ON EARTH. YOU'VE ISSUED OUT &gt;&gt; FROM THE BOSOM OF GOD. AND GOD knew you were going to BE HERE. KNEW YOU WERE GOING TO SIT HERE IN THIS MEETING. KNEW YOU WERE GOING TO HEAR THIS THING. YOU CAME FROM GOD TO BE AN EXPRESSION OF GOD ON EARTH AND TO BEAR A TRUE WITNESS. OF THE VINE. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; Do you agree with that? &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; That's what we're here for. &gt;&gt; It's an incredible time that we're living in, friends. And I pray that the spirit of God just keeps urging us on further that tomorrow will not be as yesterday and next week won't be like this week. &gt;&gt; And that you'll be used of God to have such an effect and such an influence. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; How far can we go? Who knows? There is no limits. &gt;&gt; We're birthed by God. Some here no doubt do not have that baptism. I'm not speaking about the gift now. I'm talking ABOUT THE PERSON HIMSELF &gt;&gt; COMING INTO the individual. And it's not something we you know it's not something that we determine within ourselves. But there's one thing that we can do and that is you can create an atmosphere. You can allow God to give a hunger IN YOUR HEART DOWN INTO YOUR SOUL, A CRAVING. IF YOU HAVEN'T GOT IT, YOU CAN. THAT'S ONE THING YOU CAN DO. YOU HAVE A VOICE. YOU HAVE SOMETHING THAT CAN EXPRESS YOUR HEART. &gt;&gt; DO YOU HAVE A REAL DESIRE FOR GOD? &gt;&gt; THEN IF I WERE YOU, I WOULD TELL HIM SO. I SAY, "I HAVE SUCH A THIRST FOR YOU, SUCH A HUNGER FOR YOU. I WILL PUT MY MIND IN MY THOUGHTS. I WILL FOCUS UPON YOU. I'LL KEEP THINKING ABOUT YOU. I'LL KEEP THINKING ABOUT THE PROMISE OF THIS TIME. I WON'T LET IT GET FAR FROM ME. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; I'm going to close early. I want to close in this atmosphere. As I look across the congregation and now when I make my next statement, make the next few comments, I do not want you to think of, you know, perhaps the little difficulties that you have. We all have difficulties. We all have those. We have financial difficulties. We have, you know, just life life is a can be troublesome. We all have that. But I began to ask myself this last week, what is the anointing for? What is this? I can see I can see it all happen. I hope I've been I've hope I've been able to dramatize it a we bit. Do you believe it? &gt;&gt; You believe it? &gt;&gt; You believe it come out of the bosom of God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Here come you know, Brother Bram's trying to describe it to here comes this little light. It's the logos out of this great being that is so completely under indescribable it cannot be understood. Here comes this little light and there comes transferring out of the bosom of God. Let there be light. Brother said if there was a mist that came it wasn't the word of God. Let the earth bring forth. Let the waters bring forth all the living kind and animal kingdom. Let us make man in our image. Now he begin he's transferring himself. Now he's got one that looks like him. Just like him, my son. You be the god of the earth. Then the fall and the sin and the death and the earth that he made has been bathed in blood. &gt;&gt; Yes. cruel blood. But the scripture says the righteous blood of Abel. &gt;&gt; The blood of Jesus speaks better things than that. And then God now out of his bosom, he's got to bring the redemptive plan. He's going to redeem this back. I cannot lose it. I cannot be God and lose this. And he's going to bring the redemptive plan. And that that very low goss that went out from him sets in motion the redemption. And now he begins to act it out and play it out. And he brings his masterpiece Christ. Christ Christ himself was the lost just here for a little brief moment of time and he leaves and his spirit comes into 120 and they're birthed. They're different kind of people. They're God people. &gt;&gt; There never been people like this on the earth. They're even different from the prophets. The prophet had the word going through them, but now these were born. &gt;&gt; BORN BORN BY GOD. &gt;&gt; THEY WERE BIRTHED BY GOD. &gt;&gt; And Jesus because God himself breathed when the creation was finished. GOD BREATHED INTO ADAM AND HE BECAME a living soul. And when the new creation WAS FINISHED, &gt;&gt; JESUS BREATHED ON THE DISCIPLES, RECEIVE YE THE HOLY GHOST, &gt;&gt; SHOWING THAT HE WAS THE BEGINNING OF THE NEW CREATION, BUT IN HIM IT WAS COMPLETED. IT WAS DONE. AND HE BREATHED on them. Receive ye the Holy Ghost. And now these 120. And now God begins to live in a people bringing and claiming back all that was his from the very beginning. And so that breath that was breathed into us. I've received that breath. You have received that breath. If you haven't here, if you're not if you have not received that breath, set yourself aside. say, "I I I need to receive that very breath of God. A newborn creature in Christ Jesus." That's what it's about. And friends, I'll tell you, I can go back in my life and this person I was speaking to, you're listening real close. I want to really bear it down. I said to this individual, the one thing that happened with you is it's over. &gt;&gt; There's no more struggle. &gt;&gt; No more struggle. I'm not going to say this because we're strong people. I and my wife, we lack. We have many, many lacks. I could go on a confession time right now and confess, you know, that we have a lot of weaknesses. And yet, you know, because I don't know whether it's because of the ministry what it is, but my wife and I have never never been to a minister for counseling. We've never been to anyone for counseling. God has been our counsel. I'll tell you part of that is when you settled it &gt;&gt; and you were born &gt;&gt; of the spirit of God, you got the very source within you and then it's all over. And that's what you need. That's what a person needs. &gt;&gt; My brother, my sister, I'm not opposed to I love to sit down and counsel with people to give you any kind of wisdom that I can. But I can tell you friends that we have a source. &gt;&gt; Amen. We have a source. Do you believe it? We have A SOURCE. THE ALMIGHTY GOD IS OUR SOURCE. &gt;&gt; And when you have that kind of a experience in Christ by the Holy Spirit, it's all over. &gt;&gt; It's all over. You mean we won't have a tough time? We'll have hard times, BUT YOU'LL GO STRAIGHT THROUGH IT. &gt;&gt; YOU'LL GO STRAIGHT THROUGH IT. &gt;&gt; YOU BELIEVE THAT? &gt;&gt; YOU WILL INDEED GO STRAIGHT THROUGH IT. YOU WON'T BE UP TODAY, DOWN TOMORROW, SAVED TODAY, LOST TOMORROW. THERE'S NO SUCH A THING WITHOUT OUR GOD. WE'VE BEEN BORN BY GOD. AND WE KNOW I CAME FROM THE BOSOM OF THE FATHER. &gt;&gt; AND WHETHER YOU'RE CALLED HOME TODAY OR TOMORROW, THIS WEEK, NEXT WEEK, SOME PEOPLE JUST WANTING TO GET OUT OF THE WORLD. I WANT TO BE HERE AS LONG AS HE WANTS ME HERE. I WANT TO BE A TESTIMONY. I WANT TO BE A POWERFUL TESTIMONY. I DON'T CARE IF THIS WHOLE PACIFIC NORTHWEST THINKS WE'RE A BUNCH OF FANATICS UP HERE. I DON'T CARE WHAT IT I'M NOT GOING TO BE A FANATIC FOR THE SAKE OF BEING A FANATIC, BUT WE WANT TO BE WHAT HE WANTS US TO BE. I WANT TO BEAR A TRUE WITNESS TO THE VINE. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; And this is what it says. I'm closing in just a couple minutes. And it shall come to pass in that day, Isaiah said, that his burden shall be taken away from off thy shoulder, and his yoke from off thy neck, and the yoke shall be destroyed because of the anointing. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; One thing the anointing will do, &gt;&gt; you may have some yoke. You may have something that has pressed you down. You may have something that Satan has used against you. I will announce to you today unequivocally and without any apology. The word that has come has the POWER TO BREAK THAT YOKE. &gt;&gt; IT IS THE ANOINTING. IT IS THE BREATH OF GOD. IT'S THE VERY BREATH OF GOD. AND WE HAVE MAYBE PERSONAL THINGS IN OUR LIVES AND SAY, "OH GOD, OH GOD, WHERE'S THE DELIVERANCE FOR IT?" THE DELIVERANCE IS RIGHT HERE. IT DOESN'T HAVE TO BE SOME SPECIAL, YOU KNOW, EMOTIONAL THING THAT YOU HAVE. YOU'VE JUST GOT TO BELIEVE IT. TO DISBELIEVE IT IS TO CARRY YOUR YOKE ON. YOU'LL CONTINUE ON WITH THE YOKE ON YOU. BUT IF YOU BELIEVE IT, THE YOKE, THE ANOINTING WILL BREAK THE YOKE. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; Does somebody need it? &gt;&gt; I'm here to do business with God. You want that yoke broken, you can stand to your feet and God will break that yoke at this moment. Don't be ashamed and don't be don't be embarrassed. That's what it came for, TO BREAK THAT YOKE. YOU BELIEVE THE WORD. YOU BELIEVE THE WORD AND THE ANOINTING WILL BREAK THE YOKE. YOU'VE RECEIVED AN ANOINTED WORD. &gt;&gt; Now you pray. You pray. YOU CALL ON THEM. FORGET WHO'S BESIDE YOU. WHETHER IT'S YOUR WIFE OR HUSBAND OR WHO IT IS, YOU PRAY. &gt;&gt; BREAK THAT YOKE. IN THE NAME OF JESUS CHRIST, I HAVE RECEIVED THE WORD. I HAVE RECEIVED THE PROMISED WORD. I HAVE RECEIVED THE BREATH OF THE ALMIGHTY GOD &gt;&gt; in the name of Jesus Christ. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Receive it now. &gt;&gt; Receive it now. &gt;&gt; Let that yoke be broken. &gt;&gt; I can TELL YOU FRIENDS, SATAN IS FIGHTING HIS HARDEST RIGHT NOW. You deny him. DON'T YOU LET HIM LIE to you. Don't you let him SAY IT'S GOING TO BE THE SAME. YOU SAY IT'S GOING TO BE DIFFERENT. IT'S GOING TO BE DIFFERENT. THAT YOKE IS BROKEN. THE ANOINTING WHICH I RECEIVED BREAKS THAT YOKE. THANK YOU for your &gt;&gt; Going to pray with you. &gt;&gt; Father, I know. &gt;&gt; You will not deny this people. &gt;&gt; You will not deny your word. &gt;&gt; You will deny Satan any opportunity for victory here this morning. &gt;&gt; You'll deny the powers of darkness. Oh, how he wants to fight. Oh, how he wants to resist. Oh, he wants to procrastinate. AND OUR LORD JESUS, YOU IDENTIFIED HIM. YOU SAID HE'S A LIAR FROM THE BEGINNING. SATAN, you are a liar. And we are not influenced by your lies. We're not influenced BY YOUR PRESENCE. WE'RE NOT INFLUENCED BY YOUR RESISTANCE. IN THE NAME OF JESUS, WE DECLARE YOUR HEAD has been crushed. YOUR REASONING we do not accept. YOUR LIES OUR EARS ARE CLOSED TO. WE HAVE ACCEPTED THE WORD OF the Lord. &gt;&gt; And by that word, we have received what we have come for. Lord, we believe that we have proceeded FROM GOD. WE BELIEVE as the father sent you and you said so send I you. We've been sent into this earth AT THIS SEASON. WE WERE SENT TO HEAR WHAT WE have heard. We've been SENT TO BE BORN IN THE HOMES we were born in. We've been sent to be gathered together in this company of people. And Lord, let the individuals that are in this congregation this morning know, REGISTERED IN THEIR HEARTS. THEY'VE BEEN SENT TO HEAR THIS MESSAGE THIS MORNING. LET THEM KNOW THAT THE HOLY SPIRIT HAS BEEN SENT TO FILL THEM. LET THEM KNOW THAT THE HOLY SPIRIT HAS SENT TO BREAK EVERY BONDAGE in the name of Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And I would pray Lord that you would go even beyond the walls of this building. Go out into the utter other parts of the world Lord where the hearers are listening and where they are praying and where they are standing at this moment. Make them fill that room I pray. Father go beyond into the regions of the darkness. Oh shepherd, there are lost ones that we are praying for. They're bound. They're bound with chains and feathers. Oh God, WE SEND NOW OUR PRAYER. Send your presence to them. SEND YOUR PRESENCE. Oh God, SEND YOUR PRESENCE. BREAK THE YOKE. BREAK THE YOKE OF SIN. BREAK THE YOKE of evil habits. BREAK THE YOKE OF SATAN UPON THEIR lives in the name of Jesus. &gt;&gt; Let their lips begin to speak &gt;&gt; things of truth. &gt;&gt; Let their heart be opened and let the son of righteousness shine in the name of Jesus Christ for your glory. &gt;&gt; For your glory. for your glory. We give you all the praise and the glory. &gt;&gt; Oh, we give you all the praise and the glory. &gt;&gt; I believe it would be appropriate for us to thank him, &gt;&gt; to enter into worship, to his in his august presence. &gt;&gt; Oh God, I so thank you. Thank you for the testimony I was able to give. Thank you for what you're doing, Lord, in the homes, in the families, in the hearts. Thank you for what you're doing, oh God. Oh God, continue, Father.

I pray, oh God, that let him know that he shall go out of this place having received what he came in for. What caused him to rise so quickly? Let him receive that answer for every person. Every person. I pray for them now in the name of Jesus Christ. I wonder if you're standing by someone who's standing. Why don't you lay your hand on them? Just lay your hand upon their shoulder. Say, "Oh God, I do this." This example was also given to us by our messenger. I pray for this one. I pray, oh God, that the very thing that they have stood for will now be banished. Oh God, the very thing that they stood for will be answered in the name OF JESUS CHRIST. LET THE church of the living God enter into their inheritance and receive the full benefit in Jesus name. In Jesus name. Hallelujah. Let deaf ears be opened. Let our minds be enlightened. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; God. Praise God. Praise God. Praise God.

Praise the Lord &gt;&gt; for the lion of the tribe of Judah has prepared praise and lifted up to Lord Dear heavenly father, so many times I do not even feel worthy to call upon you, but you have made us accepted in the beloved. And today I can say within the hearing of these people, we have a sacrifice that's been found perfect. Our Lord Jesus Christ was examined. And through this next week that we are having as a memorial and remembrance, he was held up and examined. And he was found perfect. It wasn't only Pilate who could say, "I find no fault in this man." But you looked upon him. YOU WERE SATISFIED WITH THE SACRIFICE. YOU WERE PLEASED WITH THE SACRIFICE. And sin's grip was broken over the face of the earth. And man could come now to full redemption. And here we are standing today at the end of the ages as it were almost feeling like we're on the balcony looking into eternity standing here in time but we're leaning forward. We're looking over the banisters at where and we see a great eternal horizon that is risen Lord. We hear marvelous words that come to us through the prophetic voice that you sent. We hear descriptions of you, oh God, that no one seems to be able to to say it like that. AND WE HEAR GLORIOUS things about your bride. Lord, we identify ourselves with that those descriptions. I pray that you will go with these people. And I ask, oh God, if there's any person that yet has been untouched and do not feel that moving within them, I ask Lord that you will deal with them in such a way. Move close to them. Lord, make yourself so present with them and set up a hunger and a desire within their heart. Lord, I pray I pray that there will be a great great transformation. Some here need it more than others. Lord, I just pray they'll identify it where that's why we preach. That's why I preach this morning. Lord, I've done what I could do. Now take it I pray and do the supernatural with it I ask in the name of Jesus Christ dismiss us now Lord with your grace your blessings I pray. Amen. Amen. God bless you name of our Lord Jesus Christ. Lord willing, we'll see you this evening. And our brother Lance Laroo as we're preparing, waiting on God for the service tonight. You will enjoy it. Amen. God bless you. You're dismissed in Jesus name. Heat. Heat. Amen. Christ my Just holdj of the spirit. And so Lord, you open the way in every situation and lead him and trust him.
