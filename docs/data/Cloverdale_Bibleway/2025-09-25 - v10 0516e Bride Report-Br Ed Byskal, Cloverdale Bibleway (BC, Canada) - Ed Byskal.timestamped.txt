[5:17] Praise the Lord.
[5:20] &gt;&gt; Well, as we walk along this journey, we
[5:22] have needs. Sometimes I don't have any
[5:24] written requests, but I'm sure you have
[5:26] things in your heart. Ask Brother Gary
[5:29] to lead us in prayer. Brother Gary St.
[5:31] John, if you've got a need, slip your
[5:33] hand up to the Lord. Know our brother
[5:35] Hughes leaving on Tuesday for Germany
[5:38] for a few weeks. We want to remember him
[5:39] and unspoken request. God bless you,
[5:42] brother Gary.
[5:45] [Music]
[5:52] Heavenly Father, you know that's every
[5:54] one of our desires, Lord, just to travel
[5:57] on, Lord, to that dimension, Lord. Lord,
[6:00] the one we're looking for, Lord, the one
[6:02] we're laboring for. The one we're
[6:05] pressing for, Lord, as Brother Tom
[6:07] preached, Lord, just pressing across the
[6:09] finish line, Lord Jesus. Lord, gaining
[6:12] that last little bit of character, Lord,
[6:14] that you'd have us to get, Lord, knowing
[6:15] that's all that will take with us,
[6:17] Father, is that character, Lord, as we
[6:19] join you in that banquet supper, Lord.
[6:22] Lord, how long it'll take, I don't know,
[6:23] Lord. Lord, how many friends will be
[6:25] there, Lord, we're counting on the whole
[6:27] multitude to be there with us, Lord
[6:29] Jesus. Lord, we're looking forward to
[6:31] your word tonight. We're looking forward
[6:33] to your spirit, Lord, blending in with
[6:35] our spirits tonight, Lord Jesus.
[6:38] hearing, Lord, what's going on overseas,
[6:40] Lord, it just warms our hearts to know,
[6:42] Lord, that now they have what we have,
[6:45] Lord Jesus. A place to gather, Lord, a
[6:47] place to worship, a house of the go
[6:49] house of the Lord that they can go into
[6:51] every service, Lord, without, Lord,
[6:53] having to gather in homes, Lord, or or
[6:55] by the wayside, Lord. We just ask, Lord,
[6:57] you'd bless them them places, Lord.
[7:00] Bless the brothers as they come forth
[7:01] tonight, Lord, and share the burden that
[7:04] they had, Lord, while they were there,
[7:05] Lord. Bless our PLA pastor, Lord. Bless
[7:08] brother John, Lord, Brother Tom, the
[7:09] remainder of the service, Lord, all the
[7:11] ministry, Lord, as they press to lead us
[7:14] across and lead us in, Lord Jesus. Help
[7:16] us, Lord, to just be so desirous of your
[7:19] word, Lord. Making it first and foremost
[7:21] in our lives, Lord, let's preach this
[7:23] morning, Lord. First things first, Lord.
[7:25] Lord, be at the height and and just the
[7:28] pinnacle of our lives, Lord. Be first in
[7:30] everything, Lord Jesus. Be first in our
[7:32] worship, Lord, this morning, Lord. Bless
[7:35] the the visitors this evening, Lord.
[7:37] Bless Brother Hugh, Lord, as he travels
[7:39] overseas, Lord. Let let him be a great
[7:41] blessing, Lord, wherever he goes. Bless
[7:44] his feet, Lord. Put a band of angels
[7:45] around him, Lord Jesus. Bring him back
[7:47] safely home, Lord. Lord, we just ask you
[7:50] to take the rest of the service and move
[7:52] in a mighty way. And we just love you
[7:54] and thank you in Jesus name.
[7:56] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[7:58] &gt;&gt; Amen. Brothers, can help us sing one
[8:00] more? Why don't you turn around and
[8:02] shake hands? We're going to stand and
[8:03] sing one more song. Brother Larry
[8:05] Codddle, you're going to sing tonight a
[8:07] special, right? So, why don't you just
[8:09] come and prepare and we'll sing Give Me
[8:12] That Old Time Religion.
[8:14] Give me that old time religion. It's
[8:17] number 497.
[8:19] Amen. You can remain standing. This will
[8:22] be our song, a standup song. Give me
[8:24] that old time religion.
[8:26] Amen. Our brother Larry, he's coming.
[8:29] All right. Oh, give me that. Old time
[8:33] religion give me that. Oh time religion
[8:38] give me that. Oh time religion
[8:42] it's good enough for me. It's now time
[8:49] and
[8:53] that's the reason
[9:14] we sing the next verse. Brother Butler,
[9:16] you you seem to be enjoying that. I want
[9:17] you to come up here and sing with these
[9:19] brothers. We're not going to let you off
[9:21] that easy. I I had you in my notes to
[9:23] come on up, Brother Butler. You don't
[9:25] come and visit us enough. So, we want
[9:28] you to feel at home tonight.
[9:30] All right. Second verse.
[9:34] It will make you stop.
[9:38] It will save you when you're dying. It
[9:42] will stop.

[11:45] [Music]
[11:53] &gt;&gt; You can have your seats tonight. God
[11:54] bless you, Brother Larry.
[11:59] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[12:01] &gt;&gt; It's so good to be back home with my
[12:03] family. Amen. Hallelujah. And it's good
[12:06] to be one in a million. Amen.
[12:08] Hallelujah. We'd just like to thank each
[12:10] one of you for your prayers
[12:14] and your thoughts of us while we were
[12:16] gone. And you're the reason that we were
[12:18] sustained in many situations. If I can
[12:21] take just a moment, a small testimony.
[12:24] Uh a couple of great highlights uh in
[12:27] the trip. We went into 20 states and um
[12:32] drove over 17,000 miles.
[12:35] And uh while I was in Pensacola, I
[12:38] stayed in um a property of my cousin
[12:42] Scott. And he had two workers that were
[12:44] there. And every night we would get
[12:47] together, Scott and I, and we would pray
[12:49] and and read the Bible and listen to the
[12:52] prophet and some DVDs that I had
[12:55] brought. And he was so hungry and
[12:57] thirsty for what we have already been
[13:00] given here at Cloverdale. So, I was
[13:03] sharing that for about a week and it
[13:06] made these two um non-Christians
[13:10] so hungry and thirsty that about a week
[13:13] into our coming together, one of them
[13:16] came to us and says, "I want to know
[13:19] about this Jesus."
[13:21] &gt;&gt; Amen. And uh we begin to share with him
[13:25] and uh he said, "I want to be saved,
[13:27] too." Amen.
[13:28] &gt;&gt; So we knelt down on the carpet and he he
[13:31] gave his heart to the Lord Jesus Christ.
[13:34] We prayed with him there in the living
[13:36] room. And the amazing thing that his
[13:40] friend said, "I'm not going to be left
[13:43] out. I want to get saved, too." So he he
[13:45] came and got down on his knees and began
[13:47] to pray and uh gave his heart to the
[13:50] Lord Jesus Christ. And um we were going
[13:53] to baptize them and was thinking about
[13:55] it. It was 18° outside in Florida, so
[13:58] y'all had summer weather up here while
[14:01] we were freezing down there. But um my
[14:04] cousin Scott sounded out and said,
[14:06] "Well, I got a big bathtub." So we took
[14:08] both of them into the bathroom and
[14:10] baptized them in the name of the Lord
[14:12] Jesus Christ. And of course, the harvest
[14:15] goes to our Lord Jesus Christ. He's the
[14:17] one that does the conviction. And we
[14:19] just want to thank him for his glory and
[14:22] for bringing us back here safely to our
[14:24] family. And again, we appreciate your
[14:26] prayers. Amen. Amen.
[14:31] A little more keyboard in the monitor,
[14:33] please.
[14:36] Hallelujah.
[14:38] [Music]
[14:40] Troubles sometimes
[14:42] are here, filling men's hearts with
[14:48] fear. Freedoms we all hold dear
[14:54] now are at stake.
[14:59] Humbling ourselves to God.
[15:04] Savage from the chasing
[15:07] rod. We're going where pilgrims
[15:12] try. Christians awake.
[15:16] Sing it with me. Jesus is coming soon.
[15:19] Jesus is coming
[15:22] soon. Morning or night
[15:25] or noon. So many will meet their doom.
[15:32] Trumpets will sound
[15:37] and all of the dead
[15:39] shall rise.
[15:42] Righteous meet in the sky. Going where
[15:47] no one dies.
[15:51] Christians away.
[15:56] Love of so many
[15:59] cold, losing their homes of gold. This
[16:05] in God's word is told. When evils
[16:12] abound,
[16:14] when these signs come to pass, nearer
[16:20] the end at last,
[16:24] it will come very
[16:27] fast.
[16:29] Hallelujah. Amen. Sing this with me now.
[16:32] Jesus is coming. Jesus is coming
[16:36] soon. Morning or night or noon,
[16:42] many will meet their doom.
[16:47] Trumpets will sound
[16:51] and all of the dead shall rise.
[16:56] Righteous meet in the sky. We're going
[17:01] where no one dies.
[17:05] Heaven bound.
[17:10] Troubles will soon be whole or happy
[17:15] forever
[17:18] more.
[17:19] When we meet on that shore, free from
[17:24] all cares.
[17:28] We're rising up to the sky, telling the
[17:34] world goodbye.
[17:38] Homeward within will fly.
[17:42] Glories to share. Stand and sing it with
[17:46] me. Jesus is coming
[17:50] soon. Morning or night
[17:54] or noon. So many will meet their doom.
[18:00] Trumpets will sound
[18:05] and all of the dead shall rise.
[18:10] Righteous meet in the sky. Going where
[18:15] no one died. Heaven word bound. Sing it
[18:22] again. Our Jesus is coming
[18:27] soon. Morning or night or noon. Many
[18:33] will meet their doom.
[18:38] Trumpets will sound
[18:42] and all of the dead shall rise.
[18:47] Righteous meet in the sky. We're going
[18:52] where no one died.
[18:56] Heaven were bound.
[19:01] All of the dead shall rise.
[19:05] Righteous meet in the sky. We're going
[19:10] where no one dies.
[19:14] Heaven word bound.
[19:18] We're going where no one dies. Heaven
[19:25] bound.
[19:37] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[19:40] &gt;&gt; You happy to be here?
[19:42] &gt;&gt; We certainly are. Well, uh, we don't
[19:46] have to talk about or worry about being
[19:48] too formal because we
[19:51] we certainly won't have any. We'll we'll
[19:53] break all the, uh, forms tonight for
[19:56] sure. We like that. God bless you. And
[19:58] we're uh, we're going to have u
[20:01] different ones participating and taking
[20:03] part. And I just like the way a number
[20:06] of brothers, you're all up here and
[20:08] brother John getting brother Butler up.
[20:10] I mean, you know, we got to just make
[20:12] sure there's no rust accumulated here.
[20:17] Hallelujah.
[20:19] Uh, I'm going to have you turn in the
[20:22] Bible. What, uh, I'll have you turn to
[20:24] book of Romans.
[20:27] And what I would like to do now while
[20:29] you're just finding the place in Romans
[20:31] the 12th chapter
[20:34] uh I I just want to give a little brief
[20:36] overview
[20:38] and not of what is going to be said and
[20:41] taking place but why we are having this
[20:44] kind of a a service
[20:47] and there are there's very good reason
[20:49] for it.
[20:51] There there's one commission that
[20:53] brother Brandham called the great
[20:55] commission and Christianity calls it the
[20:57] great commission and it is go ye into
[21:00] all the world and preach the gospel to
[21:03] every creature
[21:04] &gt;&gt; and that has never changed and that
[21:07] while that can mean your nextdoor
[21:09] neighbor but we also know from some
[21:12] things that the prophet of God has said
[21:15] it's all over the globe
[21:17] &gt;&gt; and it used to be that if you want to go
[21:19] and see your neighbor you maybe had to
[21:21] ride a horse or a camel or an ox or
[21:24] something. But today, your neighbor
[21:26] might be just a few seconds away on the
[21:29] other side of the world. Might be a
[21:32] phone call away, might be uh uh via the
[21:35] internet. There's people on the internet
[21:37] streaming that are actually a
[21:38] congregation. And they write and say, "I
[21:41] am part," and they're not ashamed to say
[21:43] it. I'm a part of the internet
[21:45] congregation. They worship with you.
[21:47] They stand when you're standing. They
[21:50] look and see where you're sitting and
[21:51] hear the different names of different
[21:53] people and those that sing and whatever
[21:55] more. And if they change position place
[21:57] in the church, they ask me when I travel
[21:59] there, where's that brother gone or
[22:01] where's that sister gone? And we just
[22:03] say, well, they moved back to the uh
[22:05] other side of the church or they're
[22:07] sitting over with their family or
[22:08] something. Then they're all unhappy
[22:10] again.
[22:12] Amen.
[22:14] The bride's a wonderful bride. I'm just
[22:16] calling this tonight because I'm just
[22:18] taking a few minutes to begin with. I'm
[22:20] calling it a bride report and it will
[22:23] largely be on regarding Europe, India,
[22:26] Indonesia,
[22:27] and Russia. We're going to try to get
[22:30] that that all done this evening and then
[22:32] we have a baptism.
[22:34] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[22:36] &gt;&gt; Nothing like adding another member to
[22:37] the bride body of Jesus Christ.
[22:40] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Just before we read,
[22:42] let's pray. Father, once again, we're
[22:45] approaching you. We're coming humbly.
[22:48] We're coming, oh God, seeking your
[22:50] favor. We're approaching you through the
[22:53] name of Jesus Christ, which is the name
[22:55] you have given us. And thou shalt call
[22:58] his name Jesus, for he shall save his
[23:00] people from their sins. And we can say
[23:03] to you, oh our father, here we are. Oh,
[23:06] we have been the recipients and the
[23:08] beneficiaries of this sacrifice. And
[23:10] here we are free. Here we are cleansed.
[23:13] Here we are, oh God, rejoicing and so
[23:16] happy in Jesus. Pray you'll bless the
[23:19] people tonight, Lord, and all that is to
[23:21] take place and all that will participate
[23:24] and our sister that is to be baptized.
[23:26] Will you fill her with the Holy Spirit?
[23:29] I pray. This is my request, oh God, in
[23:32] Jesus Christ's name. Amen. Amen.
[23:36] In the 12th chapter of Romans,
[23:41] I want to read two verses. Verse four
[23:43] and five.
[23:45] For as we have many members in one body,
[23:50] and all members are not the same office.
[23:54] So we being many are one body in Christ,
[23:59] and every one members one of another.
[24:04] Amen.
[24:04] &gt;&gt; We can say amen to that. We are members
[24:08] one of another. Didn't say if they're in
[24:11] your same church, but we are members one
[24:14] of another.
[24:16] &gt;&gt; They can be in another country, speak
[24:17] another language, be another color, but
[24:20] we are one of another.
[24:22] &gt;&gt; Amen. We're together. We're one of
[24:24] another. Every one of us are members.
[24:27] Then if you'll just turn to 1
[24:28] Corinthians the 12th chapter
[24:32] and we'll read from verse 12 three
[24:34] verses.
[24:39] For as the body is one and hath many
[24:42] members and all the members of that one
[24:45] body being many are one body, so also is
[24:50] Christ. For by one Spirit are we all
[24:53] baptized into one body, whether we be
[24:57] Jews or Gentiles, whether we be bond or
[25:01] free, and have been all made to drink
[25:05] into one spirit. For the body is not one
[25:09] member, but many.
[25:12] &gt;&gt; Can we read that 14th verse together?
[25:16] For the body is not one member, but
[25:19] many. We say praise be to God. Amen. You
[25:23] may have your seat.
[25:28] So just stay with me real uh quickly
[25:30] because I want to be as intense as
[25:32] possible and and then and then I'm going
[25:34] to move out and and others will be
[25:36] taking their part. uh the re the
[25:40] revelation
[25:41] that the body of Jesus Christ, the bride
[25:44] body when I write it in my notes or I
[25:47] write letters I usually say almost
[25:50] always the bride body of Jesus Christ
[25:54] the revelation that it is I mean the
[25:56] revelation the reality that it's a many
[26:00] membered body is not easy for us humans
[26:04] to to achieve because we are so
[26:08] materially connected, physically
[26:11] connected, naturally connected. We come
[26:14] here and we see one another. We see
[26:16] maybe some of our friends that aren't
[26:17] able to be here. I noticed, you know,
[26:19] some are down to Sister Shanahe's
[26:21] wedding and they're not here tonight.
[26:23] But that's uh uh that I won't say it's
[26:26] irrelevant. We'd love to have them here
[26:29] and we'd love to have every member of
[26:31] the bride of Christ here. But remember
[26:33] that the bride of Jesus Christ is a many
[26:37] membered body. You'll see some you'll
[26:40] see perhaps some video. I don't know
[26:42] what's what you'll see tonight. And
[26:44] incidentally, the brothers that are on
[26:45] the lights, be sure and dim them soon as
[26:47] things come on the screen. But uh the
[26:49] many membered body uh as soon as you see
[26:54] some brothers and sisters up there,
[26:56] there should be something just spark in
[27:00] your heart. There should be a flame in
[27:01] your heart. Oh, that's my sister.
[27:04] &gt;&gt; That's my brother.
[27:06] &gt;&gt; We were the other day. We were over at
[27:08] brother uh brother Luis and sister uh
[27:12] Elizabeth Diaz to have kind of a welcome
[27:15] for brother Larry and and sister
[27:18] Darlene. And he he had a video he wanted
[27:20] to show us. And so he was introducing
[27:23] all the different people. I couldn't see
[27:25] everybody but I just watched his face.
[27:27] And then when their grandkids come on
[27:29] there, oh yes, my grandkids,
[27:34] it wasn't just showing us somebody else.
[27:36] I mean, this my grandkids, this is my
[27:39] family. This is this my brother.
[27:43] &gt;&gt; And I took that and I thought to say to
[27:46] you, it shouldn't be one bit different
[27:48] tonight.
[27:49] &gt;&gt; Amen. When you see them, whatever
[27:52] whatever color they are, whatever part
[27:55] of the world they're in, whatever
[27:57] language they speak, you should be able
[27:59] to look at that screen and have
[28:01] something well up in your heart and say,
[28:03] "They're just like me.
[28:05] &gt;&gt; We resemble one another.
[28:07] &gt;&gt; We speak the same language."
[28:10] &gt;&gt; And I was thinking on that and Brother
[28:12] Kim just stepped in and and I said,
[28:14] "Well, are you are you ready?" And he
[28:15] said, "Yeah, I I wasn't able to just get
[28:17] everything I wanted." But he said, "Uh,"
[28:20] he said, "Wherever we went," he said, "I
[28:22] did. I taped the people as they sang
[28:25] only believe in their language." And I
[28:28] wanted to make a clip of every one of
[28:30] those in their language. He said, "Soon
[28:32] as you hear," it doesn't matter what
[28:34] language it comes in. Soon as you hear
[28:36] them start to sing, he said, "I just
[28:38] melt."
[28:40] &gt;&gt; Why? Because you you you relate to it.
[28:44] say, "That's my song. That's our song.
[28:46] That's our theme. Only believe." Doesn't
[28:49] matter what language is it it's in. It
[28:51] all means the same thing.
[28:53] &gt;&gt; And that's what we're here for tonight.
[28:56] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[28:57] &gt;&gt; So, it's it's something that I desire
[28:59] that this evening will achieve uh uh
[29:03] achieve that in your heart or at least
[29:05] move you in that direction.
[29:08] In the message,
[29:10] uh behold, I stand at the door. uh
[29:12] brother Brandham just he mentions these
[29:15] makes this statement. We become so
[29:18] earthbound
[29:20] with our finite way of thinking
[29:23] to this great infinite mind till we just
[29:27] get one little course set up and we feel
[29:30] like we we're just going fine. But he
[29:34] said, "If we could only look and see as
[29:38] God sees,
[29:40] how much different things would look to
[29:43] be for us."
[29:45] &gt;&gt; And I I'm going to be coming to this in
[29:47] a in a in a service in the near future.
[29:51] And I'm I've entitled that message, Lord
[29:54] willing, things are not as They appear
[29:56] to be.
[29:59] And God said to I'll just give you a
[30:02] couple leads, but God said to Samuel
[30:05] after Samuel had gone through all of
[30:07] David's sons, big strapping fine
[30:10] handsome fellas, you know, black hair
[30:13] perhaps. You know what I mean? Could
[30:15] have been blonde, but I mean, here we
[30:17] are and and says, "Surely it's this
[30:19] one." No, no, he's rejected. He's
[30:21] rejected. He's rejected. Reject them
[30:24] all.
[30:26] &gt;&gt; Have you got another one?
[30:28] Is there one more? Uh oh yeah, he's out
[30:32] hurting the sheep. Bring him in. And
[30:35] they brought this little ruddy scraggly
[30:37] guy in. And God told him, "Don't look at
[30:40] the outward.
[30:42] &gt;&gt; Don't look at what you see.
[30:43] &gt;&gt; It's not what it appears to be. I see a
[30:46] warrior. I see a king."
[30:49] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. I see one who will hold my
[30:53] promise. In fact is I see a friend. He's
[30:56] my friend. In spite of his errors, in
[30:59] spite of his mistakes or what he will
[31:01] eventually be, God was not just looking
[31:03] at the little ruddy kid.
[31:06] &gt;&gt; He was looking at what he would become.
[31:08] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. By the promise, God's not
[31:10] just looking at you the way you are
[31:12] tonight. Don't look at yourself just as
[31:14] a physical way that you are tonight.
[31:16] Look at yourself the way God looks at
[31:18] you. That's what's important. Can you
[31:20] say amen to that?
[31:22] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. You need to see. in factors
[31:24] in the world, you know, they try to get
[31:25] you to look within yourself and see your
[31:27] potentials and and uh uh uh achieve your
[31:31] goals and all of these things. Well,
[31:33] I'll tell you what, friends. Believe me,
[31:36] God has some goals.
[31:38] &gt;&gt; He's got some goals for every one of his
[31:41] children.
[31:42] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And there isn't a thing in
[31:44] this world that can stop it
[31:47] &gt;&gt; cuz God's going to bring it to its end.
[31:49] And so when he saw David, when he saw
[31:52] David, he saw so much more. He saw a
[31:54] kingdom. He saw a nation. He saw
[31:56] royalty. He saw a man that would look at
[31:58] the heavens and say, "Oh God, how great
[32:02] thou art. You're my father. Hallelujah."
[32:05] He saw one that would worship him. He
[32:08] saw one who wouldn't be carried away
[32:09] with the gold or the material things. He
[32:12] saw one who was truly his son. And God
[32:16] so loved him for that. said, "Your
[32:18] kingdom will be forever and ever and
[32:22] ever." And furthermore, God attributed,
[32:26] he loved him so much, he attributed his
[32:28] seed to David and allowed the first
[32:32] verse, the first opening verse of the
[32:33] New Testament, the testimony of Jesus
[32:36] Christ, the generation of Jesus Christ,
[32:39] the son of Abraham, the son of David.
[32:43] &gt;&gt; Quite a compliment, isn't it? Amen.
[32:45] &gt;&gt; That's a long ways from the little ruddy
[32:47] kid that was standing in front of
[32:48] Samuel. And Samuel was so moved he
[32:51] poured his oil on. The question was
[32:53] asked brother Brandaman questions and
[32:55] answers. Is the bride of Christ and the
[32:58] body of Christ the same? And he said,
[33:00] "Yes, sir."
[33:02] What you're going to see tonight is the
[33:04] body of Christ. The bride of Jesus
[33:07] Christ. One that Jesus Christ is Jesus
[33:11] Christ a reality to you?
[33:13] &gt;&gt; I ask you that tonight. is a reality to
[33:15] you. You're going to see the faces of
[33:18] individuals. And don't forget every time
[33:20] you come into the house of God in the
[33:22] sanctuary and meet believers, remember
[33:25] that these are this is one that Jesus
[33:28] Christ himself of all the peoples
[33:31] elected to be with him.
[33:34] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Elected to sit at the at the
[33:37] marriage supper table. Oh, hallelujah.
[33:40] &gt;&gt; Excuse me, but I start feeling pretty
[33:42] enthused about it. He said when God gave
[33:45] Christ his bride, the spirit gave the
[33:48] flesh the bride. He said he was pierced
[33:51] in the side under his heart and water
[33:54] and blood and spirit came forth that
[33:57] become flesh of his flesh and bone of
[34:00] his bone. We We are the flesh and bones.
[34:07] The bride will be the flesh and bones of
[34:10] Christ. That is his bride. We're sitting
[34:14] here and we've got different flesh and
[34:16] different colors and different people
[34:18] and different backgrounds. But I want to
[34:20] say we
[34:23] &gt;&gt; we
[34:24] &gt;&gt; Why don't you say it with me? We are the
[34:27] flesh and bones
[34:29] &gt;&gt; of Jesus Christ,
[34:30] &gt;&gt; the bride of Jesus Christ. And I there
[34:33] won't be anything greater you can say
[34:35] about yourself tonight. Amen.
[34:40] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[34:43] God was going to show his prophet
[34:46] just in his last few years of his
[34:47] ministry after about 30 years of
[34:50] preaching. He was going to show me. He
[34:52] said,
[34:53] "I'll show you the bride.
[34:56] &gt;&gt; I'll give you a preview of the bride."
[34:58] Well, it wasn't those sitting here in
[35:00] Cloverdale Bible Way merely. It wasn't
[35:03] just those sitting in some other church.
[35:06] It wasn't those of United States. Wasn't
[35:08] those of Canada. Wasn't those of Europe.
[35:11] But he saw them starting to march. And
[35:14] he saw them in their national garb
[35:17] after the other. And he saw them all. I
[35:20] tell you what, friends, if those doors
[35:22] flew open here tonight and they started
[35:25] walking in here from Russia on this side
[35:27] and from China over here and from the
[35:30] Philippines over here and from Africa
[35:33] over here and these doors broke open,
[35:35] they all started marching in here. There
[35:37] wouldn't be a dry eye in this building.
[35:40] &gt;&gt; Have you heard a voice from heaven? This
[35:43] is my bride.
[35:45] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. I've chosen them out of all
[35:48] the peoples. I've chosen them to be my
[35:51] very own.
[35:52] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. To sit with me in my
[35:55] kingdom.
[35:58] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[35:59] &gt;&gt; Don't just sit nonchalant, friends.
[36:01] &gt;&gt; That's either going to happen for you or
[36:03] not going to happen for you. I say it's
[36:05] going to happen for the bride of Jesus
[36:07] Christ. What? How do I know it's going
[36:09] to happen? Because God sent the call.
[36:11] The rapture call. He sent that call
[36:14] right to you to your address
[36:17] &gt;&gt; wherever wherever you were. Just think
[36:19] of and if you were born into a
[36:21] believer's home before you were born, he
[36:23] sent it there already prepared.
[36:28] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[36:30] And he said, "And then here come little
[36:32] ladies again, and each one of them was
[36:36] dressed in their national garb from
[36:39] where they came from, like Switzerland
[36:42] and Germany and so forth. Each one
[36:44] wearing the kind of garb all along with
[36:47] long hair just exactly like the one at
[36:52] the first." And here they're coming,
[36:54] walking onward Christian soldiers
[36:57] marching as to war. Brother Brennham saw
[37:01] an international group of people.
[37:07] That's what we're connected to.
[37:09] &gt;&gt; An international
[37:11] bride
[37:12] dressed in their national garments.
[37:15] If we look at the scene with the natural
[37:18] eye, we will only see what our senses
[37:21] proclaim.
[37:23] If we only see with the natural eye. And
[37:26] you know friends, if you want to be if
[37:30] you want to live below your potential,
[37:34] if you want to live below what Christ
[37:36] has for you, just look with the natural
[37:39] eye. But if you want to look
[37:41] &gt;&gt; and see the things as God sees them, oh
[37:45] God, I pray, Father, give us eyes to
[37:48] see.
[37:49] &gt;&gt; May we see the things that are not seen,
[37:53] but the eternal. May our eyes be open to
[37:57] see the eternal. Hallelujah. The I I
[38:01] love being around people that are
[38:03] speaking about things that are not just
[38:06] local things and things of my home or
[38:09] things of my family uh or things of the
[38:11] church or whatever or my work or
[38:14] whatever more. So wonderful when you can
[38:16] see things that go beyond
[38:19] &gt;&gt; beyond that. Don't you desire that?
[38:22] Amen.
[38:23] &gt;&gt; You know, I'll just drop this in. I
[38:25] don't want to take up much time,
[38:28] but
[38:30] and this might sound unrelated, but just
[38:34] yesterday, you know, we just the kids
[38:37] play on our street because it goes into
[38:40] quiet culde-sac on the end. And just
[38:42] right on our street, there's two, three
[38:44] houses and then somebody's sitting on a
[38:47] fairly large piece of property, couple
[38:49] of acres, and then there's our house.
[38:52] And uh there's some fathers are out
[38:55] there with their kids and they always
[38:56] got a uh a net, you know, hockey net out
[39:01] in the middle of the street and so they
[39:03] have to slide that off every time we
[39:05] come back and forth, which is two, three
[39:07] times a day.
[39:09] And last night, uh we had been listening
[39:13] to a tape and then we listened on our
[39:16] headphones so we can hear it. and I just
[39:17] had finished the tape and just laid my
[39:19] head down and and uh to
[39:25] start to doze off and it was around
[39:27] midnight and I just started to doze off.
[39:29] I just nicely dozed off and I heard
[39:33] real sharp fast and I leaped up and I
[39:37] said to my wife, I said, "Someone's
[39:41] knocking at the door." I said, "Did you
[39:44] hear it?" because I thought maybe I just
[39:45] dreamed it. And I said, "Did you hear
[39:48] it?" Yeah. Yeah. She said, "I did." And
[39:50] so, you know, I don't know how how
[39:52] equipped I should go when I go to the
[39:54] door. So,
[39:58] I uh I I I jumped out and went to the
[40:00] door and look, we have lights on. Nobody
[40:04] there. I go to the back door. The inside
[40:05] of the house is all black. I go to all
[40:07] the different curtains and things and
[40:09] look out. I can't see anybody. And I
[40:11] watch it. come back into the into our
[40:14] bedroom and our bedroom faces the
[40:15] street. Our windows open. So I start
[40:19] lifting the blinds and and our neighbors
[40:22] lights which are a motion activated are
[40:25] going on and then one shuts off and a
[40:27] little few minutes later it goes on
[40:29] again and and then my wife says there
[40:32] there's somebody walking down the street
[40:34] and of course anybody can walk there I
[40:36] suppose 12 little after midnight and so
[40:39] we look and he disappears
[40:42] and uh so then we hear house sirens and
[40:47] then I heard
[40:48] uh sound like an ambulance or police
[40:50] siren or something and off in a distance
[40:53] and and then these lights coming on
[40:55] again and they're going off and I
[40:57] thought, "Oh goodness, you know, this is
[40:59] all I need before Sunday. You want to
[41:01] get a good rest and we uh finally go
[41:05] back to bed again. And I get up again
[41:07] and go back to bed and and uh then then
[41:11] I heard at the front door
[41:14] and then on the glass
[41:17] with keys on my glass. So I go there and
[41:20] there's a RCMP police and uh they said
[41:24] we'd like to know if you heard anything.
[41:26] Yeah, we did.
[41:28] And uh we've been prowling around our
[41:31] house looking and two doors down from us
[41:34] or the third house down from us a man
[41:36] has just been shot and and what we heard
[41:40] was the gunfire. Those first real rapid
[41:43] which I thought was knocked was actually
[41:45] the gunfire. And so we want to know is
[41:48] the man is he how is he? She said well
[41:52] uh he's not very good. And then before
[41:55] she left she said well they've taken him
[41:57] away now. So, and actually he was he was
[42:00] murdered. He was killed. So, we had to
[42:02] go to barricades coming to church this
[42:05] morning, three barricades, ask questions
[42:07] at every barricade, show our driver's
[42:10] license and everything. And and they
[42:12] still are crawling all over the place.
[42:14] Several houses and just before I came to
[42:16] church, I had a another police officer
[42:20] from the integrated homicide squad, you
[42:22] know, asking us questions and trying to
[42:25] jar our memory and everything. And so
[42:27] this morning, you know, I was pondering
[42:29] that while brother Tom was speaking and
[42:32] throughout this day and I thought, isn't
[42:33] it amazing? He was 32.
[42:36] And just yesterday, there he is on the
[42:38] street with his kids and other father
[42:41] and another young couples, you know, and
[42:43] they moving their stuff so we can go
[42:46] through and and I thought,
[42:50] isn't it incredible
[42:53] within two seconds
[42:56] that fast that man left here?
[43:00] He left the physical and went into the
[43:04] an unseen realm, but it's a it's more
[43:08] real than the realm you're sitting in
[43:09] right now. That's right.
[43:13] &gt;&gt; And he just gone and the kids are
[43:15] without a father and the wife's without
[43:18] a husband and we don't know any of the
[43:20] details. I perhaps I don't know anything
[43:23] more about it, but I just thought,
[43:25] "Father," and I prayed just before I
[43:28] came to this pulpit. I got on my knees
[43:30] and prayed, "Lord, because we do not
[43:33] know at what time we're going to be
[43:36] called, I want to be able to stand.
[43:40] I want to be able to know that I'm
[43:44] uh that everything's right. I want to be
[43:46] able to walk into your presence with
[43:48] peace.
[43:49] I want to know that everything is all
[43:51] right.
[43:53] My friends,
[43:56] because of what
[43:59] I have to say to you tonight,
[44:02] I came actually to this place and I
[44:05] began to think about how God and I'm
[44:08] going to stray from my my subject, but I
[44:10] began to think about how God when he
[44:13] called, that's why I said about David,
[44:14] he saw David as a Samuel saw him as a
[44:17] ruddy child, a young fellow. Never
[44:20] forget when I first walked into Brother
[44:22] Brandham's
[44:23] into his motel.
[44:25] Billy Paul says, "Brother Eddie, Brother
[44:28] Brandham, Daddy." He says, "Brother
[44:30] Eddie's here to see you." Oh. Oh. He
[44:32] said, he called me Brother Biscll.
[44:33] Actually, he said, "Oh, bring him in."
[44:36] Brother Brandham sitting on the edge of
[44:38] his bed and I just walk in because we
[44:40] had communicated with a letter and he
[44:43] looked up and I could see he was
[44:44] startled and he kind of jerked a wee bit
[44:47] and put his finger up. He said, "Oh." He
[44:49] said, "Are are you Brother Biscll?" I
[44:52] said, "Yeah."
[44:53] Oh. He said,
[44:55] he said, "I I thought you were older."
[44:57] He said, "You're you're just a child."
[45:01] And I just smiled. I said, "Well, you
[45:03] know, what you see is what you got sort
[45:06] of thing. That's that's all we can be."
[45:10] But, you know, about 4 days later, he
[45:12] said, "Uh, I made some comment about you
[45:15] when you came into the motel room." I
[45:17] said, "Yeah." He said, "I said I was you
[45:20] said something about you were just
[45:22] child." Yeah. He said I said something
[45:23] about that. He said uh and he he got
[45:26] serious and he kind of winked his eye a
[45:28] wee bit and he said I I found out you're
[45:31] a man. He said, "You've had your fingers
[45:34] burnt a few times."
[45:37] Whoa. Did I ever have my fingers burnt a
[45:39] few times? And I said, "Well, that
[45:42] that's that's right." And uh uh you know
[45:46] I thought that God when he talked to
[45:49] Abraham
[45:51] and there he is you know 75 years old no
[45:55] family
[45:57] a a wife who can't bring forth any
[45:59] children there. He's been there all this
[46:02] time and but God gives him a promise and
[46:05] he believes the promise and God God in
[46:09] his heart because God knew the beginning
[46:11] from the end. You're my friend.
[46:13] You're my friend, Abraham, because you
[46:16] believe me. And you know what? God
[46:18] didn't see just Abraham and Sarah. He
[46:21] saw people like the dust of the like the
[46:24] sand of the sea. He saw people. He saw
[46:26] nations. He saw kings. He saw a people
[46:30] coming out of out of his loins. He He
[46:33] saw the end from the beginning.
[46:36] &gt;&gt; And tonight, I'm so glad you're going to
[46:38] see some of the people you're going to
[46:40] see on the screen. You're going to see
[46:42] them in reality.
[46:44] &gt;&gt; Let me say something else to you. By
[46:46] faith, you're going to hug some of these
[46:48] people.
[46:51] &gt;&gt; Is that all right?
[46:52] &gt;&gt; Would you be willing to do that?
[46:54] &gt;&gt; When you see them, you say, "Praise God,
[46:57] there's a sister.
[46:58] &gt;&gt; There's a brother." In reality,
[47:01] &gt;&gt; Brother Ed, Brother Milo, Brother Randy,
[47:03] or somebody may have seen them, Brother
[47:05] Peter. But you're going to have an
[47:08] opportunity because God sees the
[47:10] beginning from the end.
[47:12] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[47:14] &gt;&gt; And then Paul, God showed Paul, I'm just
[47:17] going to take about another six, seven
[47:19] minutes, brother Kevin. Bob, God showed
[47:22] Paul uh the heroes of faith and he wrote
[47:25] about them in Hebrews. And then when he
[47:27] came to the end, he said this.
[47:30] Wherefore, seeing we are also comp we
[47:34] are also compassed about with a great
[47:37] cloud of witnesses. Let us lay aside
[47:40] every weight. I think we need to see the
[47:43] great cloud of witnesses and see beyond
[47:46] these walls and see beyond this little
[47:48] realm and see beyond where we live and
[47:51] our friends, our associates, you know,
[47:53] our family. See way beyond it. Are you
[47:55] prepared to do that? I'm preaching to
[47:57] you friends right out of my heart. See
[48:00] beyond that and see this great cloud of
[48:02] witnesses. It will help us to lay aside
[48:04] every weight.
[48:06] &gt;&gt; And the sin was just so easily beset us.
[48:08] And let us run with patience the race
[48:11] that is set before us. That's what he
[48:13] said. Apostle Paul points us to the
[48:15] great cloud of witnesses. He didn't just
[48:17] see the handful of people that was with
[48:19] him or the even the multitude that was
[48:21] with him, but he saw a great cloud of
[48:23] witnesses. And as he said in Romans
[48:25] which we read, so we being many,
[48:29] we are one body in Christ.
[48:32] And so the call of God is not to one,
[48:34] but it's to to all.
[48:38] And uh and I I wrote down what what God
[48:40] spoke to Samuel when he looked and but
[48:43] the Lord said to Samuel, "Look not on
[48:46] his countenance or on the height of his
[48:49] stature because I have refused him. For
[48:52] the Lord seeth not as man seeth, for man
[48:56] lookth on the outward appearance, but
[48:58] the Lord lookth on the heart. God forbid
[49:01] that we look on the outward appearance.
[49:04] We know that the outward appearance
[49:06] according to the word of God is we know
[49:08] what's correct. But I'm speaking of uh
[49:11] judging a person's spirituality. And he
[49:14] God said to uh David, he said, "I took
[49:16] you from the sheep coat."
[49:19] Thus said the Lord, I took you from the
[49:21] sheep coat, from following the sheep to
[49:23] be ruler over my people Israel. And
[49:26] that's what God saw. And before you
[49:31] see the rest of this evening, I want to
[49:34] say when I moved to this town in 1967,
[49:40] they were having the armistice, November
[49:43] the 11th armistice gathering at the
[49:46] senotap for the world uh war men who had
[49:53] fought in the war.
[49:55] And they were celebrating that. and I
[49:58] moved into what was to become the
[50:01] Cloverdale Bible Wayhouse. The passion,
[50:05] I'm not saying this just for uh
[50:08] information. I'm saying this as an
[50:09] announcement and laying this on you and
[50:13] asking God to drive it to the very
[50:15] depths of your soul. The passion was I
[50:19] knew in my heart. I saw all these young
[50:21] people and the hippies at that time
[50:24] wandering around and looking for
[50:26] something real and and and they were so
[50:29] lost and they were fed up with their
[50:31] parents' money and materialism. They
[50:33] were fed up with their old formal
[50:36] churches twice dead and plucked up by
[50:38] the roots. They were fed up with all of
[50:40] their society things and everything.
[50:42] They just wanted to, you know, they just
[50:45] wanted to be happy. And I've talked to
[50:47] them and said, "We just want to be
[50:48] happy." And I knew that I had down here
[50:52] what they needed to have in order to be
[50:54] happy. And I knew something. I didn't
[50:57] know all that much about the message,
[50:58] but I knew that message was the answer
[51:01] for this generation. And my friends, God
[51:04] has proven that to be so.
[51:06] &gt;&gt; And that's why. And brother Thomas just
[51:08] one of them. And there were so many
[51:10] others. Brother Don Alexander was one of
[51:12] the first and other young men came and
[51:14] they some of them lived in the basement
[51:16] had another old house and some of them
[51:17] stayed there and some of the girls uh uh
[51:20] some of the girls to get them off the
[51:22] streets and they were went into the
[51:23] girls' house and it went on then it went
[51:25] on from that to the radio and went on
[51:28] from that to the tapes and cleaning the
[51:30] tapes and duplicating them filtering
[51:32] them and duplicating them and brother
[51:34] Lance duplicated one year almost a
[51:36] 100,000 tapes. He he made cassettes for
[51:40] them and they then they were duplicated
[51:42] and given out to anybody on their radio
[51:44] broadcast whoever wrote and 500 about
[51:47] 500 a month in Canada about United
[51:50] States and Canada about 500 a month over
[51:52] in Africa and brother Billy Ratif was
[51:55] looking after it and it just went on
[51:56] from that then it goes from there to
[51:58] discs and goes on from that into video
[52:01] and people came in and people were
[52:03] birthed by the word and all I can say
[52:06] friends that passion in this man's heart
[52:10] right now has never changed one iota.
[52:14] I'm more consumed with it probably
[52:16] tonight than I ever have been in my
[52:19] life. And it doesn't mean that you have
[52:20] to stand up and preach. I wasn't
[52:22] preaching. I was working for a living.
[52:25] But I knew that these boys needed to
[52:27] hear it. These young ladies, they need
[52:28] to hear it. They need to hear. I know
[52:30] that what was on that tape, that voice,
[52:33] it changed your life. Amen.
[52:36] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[52:37] &gt;&gt; You can't just toot along and not hear
[52:38] it. You heard brother Ton this morning.
[52:40] That voice will literally change your
[52:43] life. That is transforming power.
[52:46] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[52:48] &gt;&gt; I got a long email. We haven't got time
[52:50] for a long email out of China's uh
[52:52] forwarded by brother Murphy, brother
[52:55] Ivan, I guess. And and and and when I
[52:58] finished that, Brother Ivan, I simply
[53:00] said, I have just read the next chapter
[53:02] of the book of Acts.
[53:04] I was so moved here. I've I've read the
[53:08] Bible all my life. I said, I've just
[53:10] read the next chapter of the book of
[53:11] Acts. That's what's happening, friends.
[53:14] &gt;&gt; We don't want to just sit and think it's
[53:15] not happening. It is happening. It's a
[53:18] supernatural work that God is doing.
[53:23] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[53:25] &gt;&gt; Step into what God is doing.
[53:27] &gt;&gt; Amen. you can do something even even so
[53:29] very very little and so simple. And so
[53:34] we want to we want to enter into a a
[53:38] state of real brotherhood.
[53:40] And uh I'm what we're what we're here
[53:43] for and what you see when you see what's
[53:47] taking place tonight. you young men and
[53:49] you young ladies and you young families,
[53:52] we're interested in fostering
[53:55] &gt;&gt; uh and advancing this message
[53:59] &gt;&gt; and uh believers everywhere
[54:02] &gt;&gt; whatever means and whatever possible way
[54:04] that God allows us and by his grace over
[54:07] these many years we have been able to do
[54:11] that and continue to do so.
[54:14] &gt;&gt; We'll continue to do so.
[54:16] &gt;&gt; Amen. It's absolutely amazing what has
[54:19] been taking place and you'll you'll see
[54:22] a lot more. Now, I'm going to turn the
[54:23] service over to brother Kim and I just
[54:26] pray that God will so inspire
[54:28] uh all of you brothers and that you'll
[54:31] just speak with uh speak with conviction
[54:34] and just tell what you have met and how
[54:36] you have seen things and uh uh uh I I
[54:40] just believe that it will be a real
[54:43] blessing to the people.
[54:46] Hallelujah.
[54:48] &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham said, "Look away to
[54:51] Jesus. I may not do it, but this message
[54:55] will introduce Jesus Christ to the
[54:58] world."
[54:59] &gt;&gt; For as John the Baptist was sent to
[55:03] forerrun the first coming, so is the
[55:05] message to forerrun the second coming.
[55:08] And John said, "Behold the lamb of God
[55:11] that takes away the sin of the world."
[55:14] He said, "So, it's paralleled in every
[55:16] way, and I know it will." And I could
[55:20] say, "Brother Brandom, if he was
[55:21] standing here today, and it has, and we
[55:24] are so thankful for every little part,
[55:27] every time you have prayed, we're not
[55:29] taking up an offering. We're not even
[55:31] interested in that. We're interested in
[55:33] you feeling a part. And when you see
[55:36] another person up there, you say, "That
[55:38] might be an arm. That might be a
[55:40] finger." Listen, in the body of Jesus
[55:42] Christ, do you think there's any member
[55:44] of his body that isn't delightful and
[55:47] precious to him?
[55:49] &gt;&gt; Everyone is.
[55:50] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[55:50] &gt;&gt; Absolutely.
[55:52] &gt;&gt; Absolutely.
[55:53] &gt;&gt; He said the day is breaking. The
[55:56] daybreak is coming and this great one,
[55:58] the spirit of God, that'll come upon
[56:01] somebody in these last days that'll
[56:04] herald this message and will bring the
[56:06] hearts of the children back to the
[56:09] Pentecostal fathers. I say it into the
[56:12] name of the Lord Jesus Christ, it has
[56:14] happened. It is happening and we're able
[56:17] to were able to have some little part.
[56:19] It would wouldn't make what part
[56:21] wouldn't mean one business one makes no
[56:24] difference to me. Listen, I Brother
[56:26] Brandham said, I worked and he was a
[56:28] linesman and he was a game warden and
[56:30] all the rest of it. I've swept floors.
[56:33] I've washed windows. I've scrubbed
[56:36] people's floors for $2 an hour so that I
[56:40] could go to the native Indian people. I
[56:43] know what it is to work. I peel logs for
[56:45] the church for the other church and peel
[56:48] logs for another church as well. It it
[56:51] makes no difference. I think it's a it's
[56:53] a pleasure. It's an honor and it's a
[56:56] it's a it's just a wonderful thing to be
[56:58] able to do anything
[57:00] &gt;&gt; for the Lord.
[57:01] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[57:01] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. For any brother, for any
[57:04] sister, for whoever they are, it's an
[57:06] honor.
[57:07] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[57:08] &gt;&gt; I'm not preaching that for you. I'm
[57:10] saying it out of my own heart. It's an
[57:12] honor.
[57:12] &gt;&gt; I I think it's an honor to do something
[57:14] for God's people. Do you say amen?
[57:17] &gt;&gt; God bless you. God bless you immensely.
[57:20] Brother Kimman, God bless you.
[57:22] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. I I can tell you one thing.
[57:24] This brother worked hard and
[57:27] accomplished great things in in in India
[57:30] after he left us. And God bless you,
[57:32] brother Kim.
[57:32] &gt;&gt; Bless.
[57:33] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[57:35] &gt;&gt; Well, it's wonderful to be here with you
[57:37] this evening. When brother Bis said I'm
[57:38] going to be another six or seven
[57:39] minutes, I hoped he meant 67 minutes.
[57:43] He could have just took the evening.
[57:44] Amen.
[57:47] Amen.
[57:49] So, we want to spend the evening tonight
[57:51] talking about some of the things that
[57:52] are going on overseas. You know, there,
[57:54] you know, sometimes in the congregation,
[57:57] we don't get time to share it. And my
[57:59] wife says to me, you know, you get up
[58:00] there and you talk so nervously and so
[58:02] fast, people don't even understand what
[58:03] you're saying. So, I'm going to try and
[58:05] slow down a little bit and really just,
[58:08] you know, I'll I might take a little
[58:10] more time than I'm comfortable with, but
[58:11] I want to really help you to understand
[58:14] what the vision of our pastor, what the
[58:16] burden is to get the message out to
[58:18] people and then talk about the different
[58:20] ways that we're that that we're doing
[58:22] that. If we could have the overheads on,
[58:24] please.
[58:26] So, we just recently returned from a a
[58:29] little over a fiveweek trip, which is a
[58:32] which is a long time to be away from
[58:34] home, longer than I like to be. And
[58:38] and when we when we left originally,
[58:40] there was some meetings that Brother
[58:42] Biscll was was planning to have in
[58:44] Switzerland. And you know, I thought,
[58:47] well, it's Switzerland, it's Europe, and
[58:49] I don't usually go to Europe. But
[58:50] brother Biscll pressed me a little bit.
[58:52] He said, I think you need to be there.
[58:53] And of course after a while, you know,
[58:55] you learn to listen to your pastor,
[58:57] right? You know, if your pastor says
[58:59] that's where you need to be, then that's
[59:00] probably where you need to be. So,
[59:04] so the the the meetings were in
[59:06] Switzerland. We're going to be over a
[59:07] weekend and then four weeks later there
[59:10] was another series of meetings in
[59:11] Moscow, which of course those two places
[59:13] are fairly close together. We'll look at
[59:15] the map in a minute. And I thought,
[59:17] well, I could go and come back. But then
[59:19] I looked at the price of tickets and I
[59:20] found out, well, you know, that's going
[59:21] to cost us, you know, I thought I'm I'm
[59:24] not that far from India. Maybe I should
[59:26] slip down to India and Indonesia and
[59:28] some of these other places. So that's
[59:29] what we did. We set up an itinerary and
[59:31] we just traveled around some of those
[59:33] areas and then met up again in Moscow.
[59:35] So if you could just put that onto the
[59:37] next slide. I'm going to talk a little
[59:38] bit about, you know, what our objectives
[59:41] were, our agenda for tonight. Um, we're
[59:43] going to talk a little bit about the
[59:44] meetings in Switzerland and from
[59:46] Switzerland. We went through Cro Croatia
[59:48] and Slovenia and Israel. Brother Milo is
[59:51] going to come talk to us about those
[59:52] things. Um, Brother Richard's been
[59:54] involved for a very long time in the
[59:56] humanitarian things and some of the
[59:58] outreach things that have been going on
[59:59] in some of the former East Block
[1:00:01] countries. Some of you know about that
[1:00:03] and some of you don't. Uh and then
[1:00:05] brother Randy Snow is going to come talk
[1:00:07] to us about the uh the meetings in
[1:00:09] Russia and then when they're finished
[1:00:12] I'll take over and we'll talk about
[1:00:13] Indonesia and the things that are going
[1:00:15] on in India and some of the things with
[1:00:17] with the with the going forward with the
[1:00:19] message hub. You know we've been working
[1:00:21] very hard in India for the last few
[1:00:22] years and haven't even really told you
[1:00:24] what we're doing there. So so we want to
[1:00:26] bring you up to speed on that. Uh so if
[1:00:29] I can have the next slide. The the
[1:00:31] objectives of this trip was really to
[1:00:33] establish coordinators for languages all
[1:00:36] around the world. We're currently
[1:00:37] working in the message on the message
[1:00:39] hub. We have 43 different languages that
[1:00:42] we're working in. Um I have banked up
[1:00:46] eight or nine more languages that are
[1:00:48] ready to go up on the hub. I just don't
[1:00:50] have the arms and legs to get them
[1:00:51] there. Um, so what we're doing is
[1:00:54] establishing people that can coordinate
[1:00:56] the activity in a certain language to
[1:00:58] get the messages up onto the hub. So a
[1:01:01] language coordinator identifies location
[1:01:04] uh and and needs for mesh material and
[1:01:07] translation and print stations. They
[1:01:09] install print stations and train them
[1:01:11] how train people how to use them and
[1:01:12] work with translating and formatting get
[1:01:14] the messages up. We also wanted to
[1:01:17] modernize the operation in India to
[1:01:19] remove the old printing equipment and
[1:01:20] establish coordinators for languages.
[1:01:22] I'll talk a little bit more about that
[1:01:23] later. And uh on this trip we provided
[1:01:26] print stations and trained operators in
[1:01:28] Russia, Indonesia, India and Israel on
[1:01:31] this trip was really the objectives of
[1:01:32] this trip. So if we can go to the next
[1:01:34] slide. Uh this is a map of the world as
[1:01:37] you can see to kind of show you where we
[1:01:40] went. Um maybe you can just follow with
[1:01:42] your pointer up there. We we started in
[1:01:44] Vancouver and traveled through to uh and
[1:01:48] and traveled through to Zurich where we
[1:01:50] had the meetings. From Zurich, we
[1:01:52] slipped down to Israel. Let me tell you
[1:01:54] how that happened. Um I didn't really
[1:01:56] have a desire or a thought to go to
[1:01:58] Israel. And just a few weeks before this
[1:02:01] trip was to was to happen, a sister came
[1:02:04] to me and said, uh, and and she's a
[1:02:07] single sister, an elder sister, and came
[1:02:10] to me and said, "Brother Kim, what does
[1:02:11] a print station cost?" And I said,
[1:02:13] "Well, it's about $1,200 is about what
[1:02:15] it costs." Okay, that was the whole
[1:02:17] conversation. And the next weekend, she
[1:02:19] came to me with an envelope in her hand,
[1:02:21] and she says, "I was praying and the
[1:02:23] Lord told me to give you $1,200 to put a
[1:02:25] print station in Israel."
[1:02:28] And I didn't know there was believers in
[1:02:30] Israel. I didn't know that we needed a
[1:02:32] Prince station in Israel, but the
[1:02:33] Heavenly Father did. And so a few days
[1:02:36] later, Brother Milco came to me and he
[1:02:38] says, "Brother Kim, why don't we go to
[1:02:39] Israel?" And I'm thinking, "Okay."
[1:02:43] And so out of the mouth of two or three
[1:02:45] witnesses, you know, God put that
[1:02:46] together. And you'll hear from Brother
[1:02:47] Milo the wonderful things that happened
[1:02:49] there in Israel, and you'll see why that
[1:02:50] happened that way. From there, from
[1:02:53] Israel, we traveled on to uh we we
[1:02:57] actually traveled on to um sorry, we
[1:03:00] went I traveled through to Singapore and
[1:03:04] Malaysia and Indonesia to meet with
[1:03:06] brother Eto. Uh brother Eto's a brother
[1:03:08] who's been translating there in
[1:03:10] Indonesia and we've been trying for a
[1:03:13] couple of years actually get a print
[1:03:14] station to him and different people said
[1:03:16] to me, well, I'm going I'll take one and
[1:03:17] this and and it just never got there.
[1:03:19] So, so, so we went there. Then from
[1:03:22] there from Indonesia we went to the
[1:03:24] number five bullet up there which is to
[1:03:26] India and spent a little over a week in
[1:03:28] India and then flew up to Moscow to meet
[1:03:30] with the brothers there for the meetings
[1:03:32] there and then uh from from there we
[1:03:34] flew back home. One of the things that
[1:03:37] happened that brother Biscll mentioned
[1:03:38] the other day while we were in uh in
[1:03:41] Zurich maybe you could just put the next
[1:03:42] slide up. While we were in Zurich
[1:03:45] one morning, I was thinking, you know,
[1:03:47] it would be really good if we had a
[1:03:49] small book, you know, this little book
[1:03:52] that you can put in your shirt pocket.
[1:03:54] And I was so happy the other day when
[1:03:55] Brother Biscll gave us testimony about
[1:03:57] the Lord dealing with them on this
[1:03:58] because he said, "I read the little book
[1:04:00] that Brother Kim gave me." And no matter
[1:04:03] who I give one of these books to, a few
[1:04:05] days later, they come back with a
[1:04:06] testimony. I was reading in this book
[1:04:09] because this little book fits in your
[1:04:10] pocket. And if you're at the doctor's
[1:04:12] office, on the bus, wherever you are,
[1:04:14] it's there. And and and you end up, you
[1:04:16] pull it out. And I find I read the
[1:04:17] message a lot more now that I have this
[1:04:19] little book in my pocket. It's just just
[1:04:20] always there. And so I was sitting
[1:04:23] thinking, you know, we really should do
[1:04:25] this. And then brother Daniel Coenberger
[1:04:28] came up to me and said, "Have you
[1:04:30] thought about making a small book the
[1:04:32] same day?" And I said, "Well, yeah,
[1:04:34] yeah." I said, "As a matter of fact, I
[1:04:35] was thinking about it this morning." So
[1:04:37] he's quite an industrious man. So then,
[1:04:39] so a few hours later, he came back with
[1:04:41] one in his hand. He said, "What do you
[1:04:42] think of this format?" And so that's
[1:04:44] kind of how that happened. And so we
[1:04:47] traveled in all of these countries.
[1:04:50] Everywhere I went, we were installing
[1:04:51] print stations. So I was printing these
[1:04:53] books. Literally, when I walked down the
[1:04:55] aisle after showing him in the church in
[1:04:57] Moscow, a brother I was walking with in
[1:04:59] my hand, he reached right out and he
[1:05:00] grabbed them from me as I walked by. And
[1:05:02] I had to wrestle one back because I
[1:05:04] needed one to show show to people. And
[1:05:06] so I found that everywhere that I went
[1:05:09] of this these these these little books.
[1:05:12] So let me ask you a question. How many
[1:05:14] would like to have this kind of a book?
[1:05:18] Oh, I'm so glad to see that because what
[1:05:20] the what we need to do to get this these
[1:05:22] little books on the hub is is about
[1:05:24] 1,000 hours of work. That's what it's
[1:05:27] going to take. And I see that we've had
[1:05:28] about 300 hands. So that's only about
[1:05:31] three hours each, right?
[1:05:35] And this is the type of engagement that
[1:05:37] we're doing everywhere we go around the
[1:05:39] world. You know, I was I was standing in
[1:05:41] the meeting hall. You see the picture
[1:05:43] there where brother Murphy is in this
[1:05:44] meeting hall before the meeting started.
[1:05:46] And I was just walking up and down. I
[1:05:48] was watching the young men working,
[1:05:49] setting up the sounding, doing all these
[1:05:51] things. And the Holy Spirit spoke to me
[1:05:54] and said, "You need to engage these
[1:05:56] people in this work because you've got a
[1:05:59] bunch of young men. You know, Brother
[1:06:01] Biscllow's known them for some time.
[1:06:02] have a bunch of young men who are
[1:06:04] anxious to do something for God and
[1:06:06] there's much to be done and so it's a
[1:06:09] matter of engaging them and and I want
[1:06:10] to do the same here and I did the same
[1:06:12] in India and I did the same in Indonesia
[1:06:14] and the same in the Philippines is is to
[1:06:16] say there are things to do and outside
[1:06:19] of brother Peter when brother Peter
[1:06:20] comes up all the people that are going
[1:06:22] to talk to you tonight are not preachers
[1:06:24] and they don't work in the realm of
[1:06:25] ministry I don't work in the realm of
[1:06:27] ministry everywhere I go the brethren
[1:06:29] ask me can you preach tonight and I say
[1:06:31] Oh, well, why not? Well, I'm not called.
[1:06:35] It's really quite simple, you know, and
[1:06:38] and and so uh and so that's not the
[1:06:41] realm I work in. That's not that's not
[1:06:43] what I do. But yet getting the message
[1:06:46] into the hands of the people and and
[1:06:48] equipping them to be able to print the
[1:06:50] messages for themselves. You know, I
[1:06:52] asked a brother when I was in Indonesia.
[1:06:54] There was another brother traveling
[1:06:55] through and I asked him a very simple
[1:06:57] question. And I said, "Brother," I said,
[1:06:58] "you like to travel through and maybe
[1:07:00] have a weekend of services." And I said,
[1:07:02] "You have a weekend of services and go
[1:07:04] away." I said, "I'm here for the weekend
[1:07:05] and I'm going to leave a print station
[1:07:06] behind and I'm going to spend three days
[1:07:08] training the brothers how to get the
[1:07:10] messages up on the hub, how to print
[1:07:11] their own books, and how to have access
[1:07:13] to the message. Which one's going to
[1:07:14] have the more lasting impact?" Right?
[1:07:17] You're putting the message in the hands
[1:07:19] of the people, right?
[1:07:22] So, starting in Zurich, you know, the
[1:07:26] the the
[1:07:27] I thought it was tremendous. The end of
[1:07:29] the Zurich meetings, Brother Biscll
[1:07:31] stood up and and and said he had one
[1:07:34] little phrase that he wanted to
[1:07:35] summarize the entire meetings with. And
[1:07:38] he just looked at the people and he
[1:07:39] said, "Do something."
[1:07:42] And that was really the summary of the
[1:07:43] Zurich meetings was, you know, do
[1:07:45] something. There's much to be done. So,
[1:07:48] with that, I'm going to leave I'm going
[1:07:49] to leave I'm going to leave off Zurich.
[1:07:51] if you want to come out, brother Milco,
[1:07:52] and talk to us about Zurich, Croatia,
[1:07:54] and I'll talk to you a little bit more
[1:07:55] about Indonesia when we're when we get
[1:07:57] there.
[1:08:12] &gt;&gt; God bless you. It's when I listen to
[1:08:16] this uh service tonight, just a few
[1:08:19] minutes, it's such a privilege to be
[1:08:20] part of the plan of God. We know that
[1:08:24] we're in the will of God, whatever we
[1:08:26] do. And I'm just so happy and it's like
[1:08:29] brother Ed said is an honor. It's a
[1:08:31] privilege to be in the service of the
[1:08:35] Lord.
[1:08:37] Now, we just came from a long trip um
[1:08:39] starting again in Switzerland.
[1:08:42] Uh you see brother and sister Tutas from
[1:08:45] Romania. They drove about close to two
[1:08:47] days from Romania just to be the at the
[1:08:50] meetings. Uh he's a translator
[1:08:54] and he wanted to see the hub situation.
[1:08:58] He wasn't quite sold on it yet, but
[1:09:00] after speaking to brother Kim here for a
[1:09:03] few minutes, he says, "I'll let all the
[1:09:06] messages go on the hub." And he has
[1:09:08] quite a few of them in Romanian
[1:09:09] languages. very wonderful couple. They
[1:09:12] stayed for the whole time and then drove
[1:09:14] back
[1:09:16] back to Romania.
[1:09:19] Uh my experience in in Switzerland was
[1:09:23] again like last year a spirit of unity,
[1:09:26] hunger, people are tired like if I
[1:09:30] wouldn't do what I'm doing um in the
[1:09:34] word
[1:09:35] would would die. what what else is there
[1:09:37] to do
[1:09:39] &gt;&gt; but to take the message to somebody else
[1:09:41] &gt;&gt; you know that's the only life we have
[1:09:43] anything else doesn't matter it's just a
[1:09:46] supplementary thing that so um from
[1:09:52] the meetings in Turi which were just
[1:09:54] wonderful and you can see the fruits of
[1:09:56] the spirit and fruits of the work and
[1:09:58] brother Ed's ministry and brother uh
[1:10:01] Murphy spoke and uh it was just a
[1:10:04] wonderful time the way people are hung
[1:10:06] hungering receiving the message and they
[1:10:08] want to go on with it and do something
[1:10:10] like brother Ed said at the end and they
[1:10:12] caught that and they do want to do
[1:10:14] something it's starting a fire and this
[1:10:19] uh hub is something else is just
[1:10:21] unbelievable there is opposition to it
[1:10:23] is people don't understand not because
[1:10:26] they don't want to they just don't
[1:10:27] understand what this is all about and
[1:10:30] once it is explained and they see books
[1:10:33] popping out they just, you know, they
[1:10:36] just grab like brother Kim said and they
[1:10:38] want more and more and more. So, it's
[1:10:41] it's a revolution out there with a hub
[1:10:44] and I think we'll see some great things
[1:10:46] in very near future.
[1:10:49] Um, we decided to take some time off and
[1:10:52] we drove down to with the brother Kim,
[1:10:56] sister B and sister Hedi to Italy,
[1:11:01] Slovenia, Croatia
[1:11:03] and um met with the Lerga family first,
[1:11:08] brother Jonathan, the whole family for
[1:11:10] about um we were there overnight.
[1:11:14] Uh then we went to east northeastern
[1:11:18] Slovenia to meet. Can you do the next
[1:11:20] slide please?
[1:11:23] Yes. Uh here we are in Slovenia in
[1:11:26] Croatia. Here on the right side I'm
[1:11:29] explaining there's a castle that brother
[1:11:30] Ed knows very well about where my
[1:11:32] forefather had something to do there.
[1:11:36] And um and that's the family in Croatia.
[1:11:41] uh we spend you know a couple of days
[1:11:43] with them. The next slide
[1:11:48] then here you have in the bottom brother
[1:11:51] Roman and sister Sonia. They are the
[1:11:53] trans new believers just couple of years
[1:11:56] in the message. Um they came they came
[1:12:00] to the message over the internet and
[1:12:03] they started reading and to make long
[1:12:05] story short
[1:12:07] they were adriatic sea of the holidays
[1:12:10] and they said we must be baptized. So
[1:12:12] they baptized each other.
[1:12:16] &gt;&gt; But later on as they met brother uros
[1:12:18] they saw that they should be properly
[1:12:20] rebaptized again. And there you have
[1:12:23] brother Uros and family on the left on
[1:12:26] top and that's who we were all together
[1:12:29] in his house the whole group. Uh brother
[1:12:34] Uros by the way he
[1:12:36] said to brother Kim that he will uh work
[1:12:40] with him and start sending on messaging
[1:12:44] to the hub. And I just received a large
[1:12:46] email from him that uh he has about 15
[1:12:50] messages that are uh some are ready
[1:12:53] about seven of them. Uh the rest are
[1:12:56] still to have to be proof read and some
[1:12:57] are just in the process of being
[1:12:59] translated.
[1:13:01] And uh but the other couple Sonia and uh
[1:13:05] and Roman they translated seven. We have
[1:13:08] seven already on the hub and there's
[1:13:10] more to come. They're very uh anxious to
[1:13:13] translate and keep on going.
[1:13:16] Next.
[1:13:18] And here we are in Israel.
[1:13:21] Um these are my very
[1:13:38] sorry
[1:13:40] my very dear friends.
[1:13:46] Uh on the left here you have brother
[1:13:48] Sergey. looks like he will be the leader
[1:13:51] in that group. It's possible. We don't
[1:13:53] know yet, but the inclination is that
[1:13:56] way. Brother,
[1:13:58] he's the one that um after being in
[1:14:02] Alusha, Ukraine meetings two years ago,
[1:14:05] he watched brother Kim demonstrating the
[1:14:10] uh the hub. He came to Israel right away
[1:14:13] and
[1:14:19] Sorry.
[1:14:25] Printed about 25 messages right away.
[1:14:30] Uh, Sister Julia on top, she's our
[1:14:32] interpreter. She's and her husband are
[1:14:34] the only two that speak English. They're
[1:14:36] Russian Jews.
[1:14:39] Some are partly this. We have gain in
[1:14:41] the middle is 100% Jews. Jew. Brother
[1:14:46] Victor
[1:14:47] uh who travels also to Alusha to the
[1:14:51] meetings many times. He lives in
[1:14:53] Eshkolon and the rest of them are in Tel
[1:14:55] Aviv.
[1:14:57] And um we left them um printing station
[1:15:02] and I just received an email from them
[1:15:12] and they said um
[1:15:17] I sent them an email and they said I
[1:15:18] I'll she said Julia who's a translator
[1:15:21] she said I'll read your message to
[1:15:24] everyone and say hello from you. Thank
[1:15:26] you very much for hub printer. We read
[1:15:30] the sermons and hand them out. I was
[1:15:33] very blessed by the sermon why are
[1:15:36] people so tossed about and rem
[1:15:39] recommended it to all my friends and
[1:15:42] relatives and people at work
[1:15:45] and then she said we're waiting for
[1:15:47] brother and sister Biscoll to come and
[1:15:48] visit us.
[1:15:51] Amen.
[1:15:54] So, um, they're very,
[1:15:57] uh, hungry for the message. They want
[1:15:59] to, they're looking for a translator
[1:16:02] into Hebrew language.
[1:16:05] They,
[1:16:07] they're just, we just, they're just so
[1:16:09] blessed. They told me privately how
[1:16:10] blessed they are that they have a
[1:16:11] printer that they can just print any
[1:16:13] message they want right now in Russian,
[1:16:15] especially in Russian language.
[1:16:18] And um
[1:16:21] so they will send you please give our
[1:16:23] love and greetings to church in
[1:16:25] Cloverdale
[1:16:27] Julia and message believers of Israel.
[1:16:31] Also in the Croatian language we have 59
[1:16:35] languages on the hub right now and that
[1:16:37] they continue to translate all the time.
[1:16:40] Serbia brother Alladin who was here last
[1:16:42] year is still translating has 91
[1:16:46] messages on the hub with and he works
[1:16:48] with Drago Dragoir who is a has a small
[1:16:51] church close by and uh Alladin and him
[1:16:56] they created live streaming so that many
[1:16:58] people in uh different countries who
[1:17:01] don't speak any other language but
[1:17:03] Serbian they could listen directly into
[1:17:06] the services Serbian languages es
[1:17:10] and uh the Croatians, Serbians, and
[1:17:12] Slovenians too. They're all sending a
[1:17:14] lot of books, DVDs, and CDs all over the
[1:17:17] world in the country. People are writing
[1:17:19] in. So, we don't know what and what will
[1:17:22] happen, but the the word is going out.
[1:17:26] And uh the last one is brother Miracle
[1:17:29] in Chicago. Brother Tom, I guess we'll
[1:17:31] have to go this week at the end of the
[1:17:33] month. They're waiting for us. And I
[1:17:35] believe Mira's wife, Jifka, wants to get
[1:17:38] baptized and they're waiting for a tomb
[1:17:41] and bring the word to them. Amen. Well,
[1:17:45] I thank you and forgive me and God bless
[1:17:47] you. Amen.
[1:17:55] Amen. And if you've traveled abroad and
[1:17:58] have met the saints other in in other
[1:18:00] countries, you'd fully understand how
[1:18:02] brother Milco feels tonight. You know,
[1:18:04] they they when I came home, the first
[1:18:07] song I I led, if you recall, was I'm so
[1:18:09] glad to be a part of this family of God.
[1:18:11] They've taken me into their into their
[1:18:13] heart, and I had just met all these new
[1:18:15] believers around the world, and they've
[1:18:16] taken me into their heart, and I'm just
[1:18:18] so glad to be a part of this family.
[1:18:20] &gt;&gt; Amen. You know, everybody in the world
[1:18:22] is looking for a place to belong. I'm so
[1:18:25] thankful that I belong to Christ and the
[1:18:27] body of Christ.
[1:18:28] &gt;&gt; Amen. Uh just to recoup a few of the
[1:18:31] things in uh in Zurich. Um you saw the
[1:18:34] picture. Maybe just back up too if you
[1:18:36] don't mind the the picture of the
[1:18:38] brother who's uh back up one more.
[1:18:41] Brother
[1:18:43] Reggu
[1:18:45] Radu on the on the top there and his
[1:18:47] wife. He sent me yesterday the first
[1:18:49] book in Romanian that they they've now
[1:18:50] got formatted and ready for the hub. And
[1:18:53] so he's just uh he's just working away
[1:18:55] at it. We spent time and trained them
[1:18:57] there when we were there. Much the same
[1:18:59] as what the young people are doing here,
[1:19:00] getting them formatted up onto the hub.
[1:19:02] He found that the the translations that
[1:19:04] were available, he felt needed some
[1:19:07] work. So he's going through and editing
[1:19:10] and and rewarding and re and and
[1:19:12] upgrading them all and getting them
[1:19:13] ready. So that we got right away. Um,
[1:19:16] also, uh, we got an email, brother
[1:19:19] Biscll and I both got the same email
[1:19:21] today from brother Daniel who's, uh,
[1:19:24] working with the German language. And
[1:19:26] brother Biscll really pressed the German
[1:19:28] people, I felt, when we were there in
[1:19:30] the meetings in Zurich to say, why don't
[1:19:32] you have more messages available? And
[1:19:35] and brother Daniel really took it to
[1:19:37] heart. And he's been busy. Uh we spent
[1:19:39] time with brother Gird and all the
[1:19:40] different German people that I ran into
[1:19:42] at the different parts of the trip like
[1:19:44] when we got to Moscow all said that they
[1:19:46] had had a call from Daniel looking
[1:19:48] desperately for German translations.
[1:19:51] So he's the the pressure he's feeling
[1:19:54] the pressure and he said that they have
[1:19:56] found about right now we have about 72
[1:19:59] German messages on the hub. He found
[1:20:01] about 280 of that. There's about 178
[1:20:05] different ones and he's working to get
[1:20:07] permission from all of the different
[1:20:08] translators to get them up onto the hub.
[1:20:11] And again, seeing how that, you know,
[1:20:14] often times a translator gets
[1:20:15] discouraged because he translates and
[1:20:17] nobody prints the book, so he can't
[1:20:18] afford to print the books and they don't
[1:20:20] get printed and so they get discouraged.
[1:20:22] So what we see is a real renewal now
[1:20:24] when people say, "Okay, well put it up
[1:20:26] in the hub now. Print it immediately."
[1:20:29] It's actually inspiring the translators
[1:20:32] to to to to get back into translating.
[1:20:34] So, we're seeing a a a big growth and
[1:20:37] part of what I want to convey to you
[1:20:39] tonight. You know, some people have
[1:20:42] said, "Well, we've heard you're not
[1:20:43] working so much in the Philippines and
[1:20:44] India and things are kind of winding
[1:20:46] down at Bible believers." Let me tell
[1:20:48] you, it's exactly the opposite. It's
[1:20:50] absolutely opposite. We're currently
[1:20:52] working, as I said, in 43 languages. I
[1:20:55] have another nine I need to get on the
[1:20:56] hub and I don't physically have time to
[1:20:59] do it. I mean I can handle three or four
[1:21:01] languages myself and brother Murphy is
[1:21:03] looking after Chinese and brother Ivan
[1:21:05] and brother Ivan's looking after a few
[1:21:06] more languages which means we are
[1:21:08] currently behind in about 35 languages
[1:21:11] of messages that need to be up and work
[1:21:13] that needs to be done and we just need
[1:21:16] we need arms and legs. That's what we
[1:21:17] need. So the some of the other brothers,
[1:21:20] um, Brother Iverson, your brother
[1:21:23] Jonathan came to me and said, "There's
[1:21:25] more Dutch messages. Why aren't they up
[1:21:27] on the hub?" And I said, "I don't know.
[1:21:29] You probably want to ask the Iversons
[1:21:30] cuz they put all the rest up." And asked
[1:21:33] them why they're not up on the hub. So
[1:21:36] So uh, he basically said, "Oh, you mean
[1:21:38] I can do that myself?" And I said,
[1:21:40] "Mhm." So he's going to go to work and
[1:21:42] do that. He also he also uh agreed um
[1:21:46] offered actually uh to work with the
[1:21:48] Italian messages because we don't have
[1:21:50] any Italian messages on the hub and
[1:21:52] again there's some around so he's now
[1:21:54] starting to do the work of contacting
[1:21:55] all the different translators and going
[1:21:57] to get that together. So I really felt
[1:22:00] that uh there was some really lasting
[1:22:02] things that happened in the meetings in
[1:22:04] Zurich in that many people became really
[1:22:06] engaged in the concept and stirred up.
[1:22:09] You know, we talked to the brothers, you
[1:22:10] know, we've talked to you before about
[1:22:11] Sister Fasia who's in uh Algeria and
[1:22:14] received the message over the internet
[1:22:17] and uh you know, she's quite a little
[1:22:18] missionary and she has three or four
[1:22:20] converts now and they have a little
[1:22:22] group and I encouraged the brothers in
[1:22:24] in Switzerland, you know, brother
[1:22:26] Francois who who speaks French like she
[1:22:28] does and it's an hour and a half flight
[1:22:30] for him to go see her and I said, you
[1:22:31] know, why don't you get on an airplane
[1:22:33] and go see her? you know, it's difficult
[1:22:35] for me all the way from North America or
[1:22:37] for brother Bisco and we don't speak the
[1:22:38] language when we get there. So really
[1:22:41] really working to engage and partner
[1:22:44] with as many people as we can to do this
[1:22:46] to do this great work and the same going
[1:22:48] through Slovenia and and and Croatia
[1:22:51] working with the different translators
[1:22:53] there and we met so many I just have to
[1:22:56] say wonderful people on this trip. If I
[1:22:58] look at brother Jonathan Larga and and
[1:23:01] you know some of you some of you
[1:23:02] actually know him. He's a young man. Uh
[1:23:05] Milco, how old is he?
[1:23:06] &gt;&gt; 28.
[1:23:07] &gt;&gt; He's 28 years old. Um the services that
[1:23:12] come from here. He he went and bought a
[1:23:15] computer and set it up so that it can
[1:23:17] stream. So he sits and streams the
[1:23:19] services as they come from Cloverdale
[1:23:21] and he translates them into
[1:23:24] &gt;&gt; Croatian. He translates them into
[1:23:26] Croatian live and streams them out from
[1:23:29] his places to several locations all over
[1:23:31] Croatia so that people can actually hear
[1:23:33] the services. And nobody's paying him to
[1:23:36] do that.
[1:23:37] &gt;&gt; He does that on his own, you know, and
[1:23:40] and we ran into so many people like
[1:23:42] that, you know, the the the the other
[1:23:44] couple uh brother Roman and his wife. I
[1:23:46] mean, they're just translating. They
[1:23:48] have a burden to get the message to the
[1:23:50] people that speak their language. You
[1:23:52] know, there's certain people you meet
[1:23:54] them and you realize they either either
[1:23:56] the Holy Spirit spoke to them directly
[1:23:58] or they read the message convinced then
[1:24:00] concerned
[1:24:01] &gt;&gt; because if you're really convinced this
[1:24:03] is the truth,
[1:24:04] &gt;&gt; you're concerned about your brother
[1:24:06] &gt;&gt; and and I can't hardly imagine that I
[1:24:08] would know another language. You know,
[1:24:10] so many places I go where they have
[1:24:12] four, five, six messages or or even 50
[1:24:15] messages. You know, I I asked a brother
[1:24:16] in Africa once I said, "How many message
[1:24:18] do you have in Swahili?" He said, "About
[1:24:20] 50." I said, 'Well, do you realize
[1:24:22] you've you've exposed your people to
[1:24:24] less than 5% of what God sent in this
[1:24:27] age? And you know, it was it was brother
[1:24:29] Zephaniah Peters. And he looked at me,
[1:24:31] he says, 'Oh, brother, that sounds so
[1:24:33] bad when you say that, but but it's
[1:24:35] still the truth, you know.
[1:24:38] So, so I really felt that the time in
[1:24:41] Europe was really, really well spent in
[1:24:43] that many people have been engaged in
[1:24:46] the work. You know, there's just so many
[1:24:48] people that, you know, one of the
[1:24:50] ministers the other day, it might have
[1:24:51] been brother Biscell, I heard say, you
[1:24:52] know, it's not just go to church, come
[1:24:54] home, go to church, come home. That's
[1:24:56] like that's like driven cattle. You
[1:24:58] know, let's get engaged and let's be
[1:25:00] part of this work. And and I can't think
[1:25:03] of anything more humbling than to be
[1:25:04] involved when we look at, you know, all
[1:25:07] the great things of this earth and think
[1:25:08] about what is God doing in our
[1:25:10] generation today? the God of heaven of
[1:25:13] all ages. What is he doing in this age?
[1:25:16] You know, he's calling a people by his
[1:25:19] word.
[1:25:20] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:25:20] &gt;&gt; And he's asked us to be a part of it.
[1:25:23] &gt;&gt; I mean, it's it's it's an incredibly
[1:25:24] humbling thing. We're going to ask
[1:25:27] brother Randy to come talk to us about
[1:25:28] Moscow. Where you hiding, Randy?
[1:25:32] Behind there. Come, Randy. And Ry's
[1:25:34] going to talk to us about about the
[1:25:36] meetings in Moscow. It was good to have
[1:25:38] Randy along. You know, when you're
[1:25:40] traveling in a foreign country, you
[1:25:41] know, it's always good to have a big guy
[1:25:43] with you. Amen. Come, Randy. Amen.
[1:26:01] &gt;&gt; Well, God bless you guys.
[1:26:04] Um, I don't know why they got me into
[1:26:06] this, but I'll give you the best shot I
[1:26:08] can give you.
[1:26:12] &gt;&gt; You know, I it was a real p privilege to
[1:26:14] go with brother Ed on this trip to
[1:26:17] Moscow.
[1:26:18] Um,
[1:26:20] well, I can't see, so I'm going to turn
[1:26:22] around. Anyway, um I wrote some notes
[1:26:26] here and I says, you know, um
[1:26:29] you know, it was an honor to go with him
[1:26:31] to travel with a friend and my pastor to
[1:26:34] see all he goes through to get to the
[1:26:37] word out and all the other ministers. So
[1:26:40] like I it blew my mind that what he has
[1:26:44] to go through to get to these places to
[1:26:48] preach to give the word out and you know
[1:26:50] it's not a vacation. It's um
[1:26:55] basically hard. It's really hard. And
[1:26:58] just to throw you to show you some of
[1:27:00] the pictures, that's when we're getting
[1:27:02] into the to the uh airport after 15
[1:27:07] hours or 17 hours or who knows. And you
[1:27:11] can see the carts with with the print
[1:27:13] stations,
[1:27:16] brother Biscoll, brother Richard Drake,
[1:27:19] some of the brothers there. And the
[1:27:21] bottom picture is where they u brother
[1:27:24] Sergey picked us up and then uh we were
[1:27:27] all dead, right? We're ready to go to to
[1:27:29] to uh bed, but they decided that they
[1:27:32] wanted to feed us. So,
[1:27:35] um away we go. So, the next next slide.
[1:27:40] So, there's the uh a little bit of the
[1:27:42] church, pictures of the church. We're
[1:27:44] looking at the church. Uh I was quite
[1:27:47] impressed with the way they built the
[1:27:48] place. The only thing I was a little
[1:27:50] bummed about is there was one only one
[1:27:51] only one exit getting out of there and
[1:27:53] they had no exit signs and no fire
[1:27:55] extinguishers, but that's just sort of
[1:27:57] me.
[1:27:59] &gt;&gt; They're going in the raptor, brother.
[1:28:01] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:28:02] So, uh again, that was just me. So, uh
[1:28:07] just little notes, I guess, in
[1:28:08] construction. Uh and then the next
[1:28:10] slide.
[1:28:12] And then this is um a picture of Brother
[1:28:15] Sergey's house. And the way brother Eda
[1:28:17] was explaining to me and brother Sergey
[1:28:19] was that they had to build it to build
[1:28:23] to get the building built. He had to
[1:28:25] move and so they had to build his place
[1:28:26] first and then try to build the rest of
[1:28:28] the church. So that's all the brothers
[1:28:31] sitting there in the kitchen there with
[1:28:33] uh brother and sister Sergey uh eating
[1:28:37] breakfast. Now the only other thing I'll
[1:28:39] say because I think that's the last
[1:28:41] slide, right? is um that you know,
[1:28:45] brother Ed asked me to say sort of what
[1:28:47] I thought of the trip and why uh what I
[1:28:50] got out of it. And so I guess in my own
[1:28:53] words, the best way I can say it is um I
[1:28:57] learned how dedicated the saints are,
[1:29:00] you know, going there and uh how hungry
[1:29:03] they were for the word um and brother
[1:29:06] Brandham's message. So it was like wow.
[1:29:10] And then um I get then I you know I
[1:29:13] wrote another note again this is again
[1:29:16] just me. I said I guess what I
[1:29:18] personally brought back from the trip is
[1:29:21] how much we have if I can read this
[1:29:25] compared to what the saints in other
[1:29:26] countries have. In other words, and so
[1:29:28] I'm going to use a word I've got in
[1:29:30] trouble with for but we're spoiled.
[1:29:33] And um
[1:29:36] sing here.
[1:29:37] In other words, um like they were so
[1:29:40] happy to see brother Kim the messages.
[1:29:42] They both happy to hear brother Gearwell
[1:29:44] Rotoall. They were so happy to hear
[1:29:46] brother Ed and uh brother Kim show the
[1:29:50] print stations. They were like and I
[1:29:51] don't want to say it wrong. They were
[1:29:52] foaming at the mouth. They were ready
[1:29:55] for everything. And um
[1:29:58] you know we me I guess growing up in the
[1:30:01] message have taken it so common.
[1:30:08] So anyway, that's what I got out of it.
[1:30:11] That is maybe
[1:30:14] we need to be better, get a little
[1:30:17] stronger and try to help get this stuff
[1:30:19] out. And u
[1:30:22] I'd go again, but uh Brother Ed and all
[1:30:26] these ministers, they they deserve a
[1:30:27] medal.
[1:30:30] &gt;&gt; Anyways, thank you.
[1:30:33] [Music]
[1:30:41] Amen. Thank you, brother Randy.
[1:30:45] Moscow, we're going to have brother
[1:30:47] Richard come and talk to us shortly. Um,
[1:30:49] you know, in Moscow, we took a print
[1:30:52] station there that Brother Biscll and
[1:30:54] Brother Randy each carried a carried a
[1:30:56] print station all the way there, and
[1:30:57] that's that's always a challenge in
[1:30:58] getting it through the airport. the one
[1:31:00] that we took all the way to Indonesia.
[1:31:02] We started with it in Vancouver and took
[1:31:04] it to Zurich and from Zurich we went to
[1:31:06] Israel and Israel to Singapore and
[1:31:07] Singer the port of Malaysia and carried
[1:31:09] this print station all the way as as we
[1:31:11] got there. And it was interesting
[1:31:13] getting out of Israel because of course
[1:31:15] there's very heightened security there.
[1:31:17] So I I wheeled up with this thing. You
[1:31:20] know how it is trying to get some of
[1:31:21] this odd stuff through an airport, you
[1:31:22] know, and especially Israel. So, they're
[1:31:25] careful about what they allow on an
[1:31:26] airplane in case it's got something
[1:31:28] unfriendly in the package, you know. And
[1:31:30] so, I wheeled it up to security and they
[1:31:33] just looked at that and started shaking
[1:31:34] their head right away. And she and the
[1:31:36] woman asked me in security, she says,
[1:31:37] "What's in that box?" I said, "It's a
[1:31:39] printer. Where's it going?" "It's going
[1:31:41] to Indonesia." "Why are you taking a
[1:31:43] printer to Indonesia?" "Well, they need
[1:31:44] a printer." "Are there no printers in
[1:31:46] Indonesia?" "Yes, there's printers in
[1:31:48] Indonesia, but you know," and I
[1:31:49] explained the whole thing. And what are
[1:31:51] you printing? Well, we're printing
[1:31:52] Christian literature. do you have a
[1:31:53] sample? I had a pocketbook.
[1:31:56] And I said, "Yeah, I got a sample right
[1:31:57] here." And I handed it to her. And you
[1:31:59] know, it was, "Believest thou this?" And
[1:32:01] so she looks at this and she starts
[1:32:03] flipping through and she starts reading
[1:32:04] this and reading this and reading this.
[1:32:08] And after a while, she says to me, "Who
[1:32:09] is this guy?" I said, "He's the f he's a
[1:32:11] prophet, the fulfillment of Malachi 4,
[1:32:14] preparing the hearts of the children for
[1:32:15] the coming of the Lord." and she just
[1:32:17] kind of looked at me
[1:32:21] and said, "Okay, over there in the high
[1:32:24] security, we got a nutcase here, you
[1:32:26] know, but uh you know, by God's grace,
[1:32:29] we got it through and got it all the way
[1:32:30] to Indonesia, but it's it's it's it's
[1:32:33] always a challenge to get it, you know,
[1:32:35] to to get things done." And you know to
[1:32:37] to add to what brother Randy said, you
[1:32:39] know, when you're traveling, you know,
[1:32:40] it's it's it's annoying enough to get
[1:32:42] through airports and whatnot, let alone
[1:32:44] having a 70 lb printer or as we did when
[1:32:46] we got to Zurich, three of them, you
[1:32:47] know, and trying to get through the
[1:32:48] customs and security and all that. So
[1:32:51] that's why I'm really happy to be
[1:32:53] partnered with the with the work that
[1:32:54] Brother Richard is doing of sending
[1:32:56] things all over the place because
[1:32:58] brother Richard sends boxes of clothes
[1:33:00] and we slide in their printers and toner
[1:33:02] and cartridge and all those things to
[1:33:03] get them around the world. So come talk
[1:33:05] to us about what you're working with,
[1:33:06] Brother Richard.
[1:33:15] Uh just before I uh uh start here, just
[1:33:18] if I just read a scripture, uh Galatians
[1:33:21] chapter 6. I've read it before and uh
[1:33:24] it's just uh one of my favorites. Um and
[1:33:27] I'm going to start in verse 7.
[1:33:29] Be not deceived.
[1:33:32] God is not mocked.
[1:33:34] For whatsoever a man sweth that he also
[1:33:38] that shall he also reap. For he that
[1:33:40] sweth to his flesh so shall of the flesh
[1:33:43] reap corruption. But he that sweth to
[1:33:45] the spirit shall of the spirit reap life
[1:33:48] everlasting.
[1:33:50] And let us not be weary in welloing.
[1:33:55] For in due season we shall reap
[1:33:58] &gt;&gt; if we faint not. As we have therefore
[1:34:02] opportunity,
[1:34:04] let us do good unto all men, especially
[1:34:08] unto them who are of the household of
[1:34:10] faith.
[1:34:12] &gt;&gt; Um, you know, God put it on my heart. He
[1:34:15] gave me that opportunity in 2001
[1:34:20] and uh is to respond to a natural need
[1:34:22] for the saints. I know you can uh the
[1:34:25] denominational world has perfected the
[1:34:27] art of works and although I don't
[1:34:30] subscribe to that at all. Um it has to
[1:34:33] be balanced. If you ever decide to read
[1:34:34] the book of James, James talks about how
[1:34:37] your works should be demonstrating the
[1:34:39] kind of faith you have on the inside. So
[1:34:41] there is a balance to all that. And um
[1:34:45] the saints in the former Soviet Union um
[1:34:48] were under extreme economic duress in
[1:34:50] 2001
[1:34:53] 99201
[1:34:55] and God gave me this opportunity um you
[1:34:58] know sometimes if you're a young man
[1:35:00] going to work and I was pushing a broom
[1:35:02] for the school board and I kept thinking
[1:35:05] God I wanted to work for the school
[1:35:07] board so I could be in contact with
[1:35:09] young people so I could witness the
[1:35:10] gospel and suddenly I find myself
[1:35:13] pushing a broom after all the kids have
[1:35:15] gone home. Why am I here doing this?
[1:35:19] Well, it it gave me the opportunity to
[1:35:21] come across a um uh the vast majority of
[1:35:24] of clothing that initially went to the
[1:35:26] third world and the communist countries
[1:35:28] and that kind of thing was lost and
[1:35:30] found from schools. So, it gave me a
[1:35:33] contact. Everything you do in life, God
[1:35:35] has a purpose for it. So, don't worry
[1:35:37] about the box God put you in, you're
[1:35:39] there for a reason. Okay. So, um, the
[1:35:42] there's three basic things that people
[1:35:44] have in life. That's shelter and food
[1:35:47] and clothing. And so, I just looked at
[1:35:49] this and thought if I can just simply
[1:35:50] give them some clothing, surely they'll
[1:35:52] have a little leftover, some better
[1:35:53] shelter and, you know, to be able to
[1:35:55] feed themselves. Um, I know that over
[1:35:58] the years it's proved to be exactly
[1:36:00] that. It's worked out very, very well.
[1:36:02] Uh, my trip to these meetings, I wasn't
[1:36:05] actually going to go. Uh, I kept tossing
[1:36:08] it around. It's expensive. It's uh I
[1:36:10] wasn't really going for it's not a very
[1:36:12] long time that I was going to be over
[1:36:13] there. Um I mean I was there in 2007. I
[1:36:18] got a good perspective of what the
[1:36:19] country was about um with brother Gido
[1:36:22] and of course I came back. I never ever
[1:36:23] gave a report on that because I kind of
[1:36:25] landed here right at the the the Sunday
[1:36:27] before the missions 2007 convention and
[1:36:30] the whole church was immersed in that
[1:36:32] and uh and time went on. So, but it gave
[1:36:35] me a really good basis to find out that
[1:36:37] uh
[1:36:39] how would I put this? Um
[1:36:42] well, I'll put it this way. In Matthew,
[1:36:45] uh chapter 24, I think it is, uh Jesus
[1:36:49] has the young lady's come in and she's
[1:36:50] broke the alabaster box on his head. And
[1:36:53] uh everybody's all up in arms and saying
[1:36:54] that should have been sold and given to
[1:36:56] the poor. And and Jesus made the
[1:36:58] statement, "The poor you have with you
[1:36:59] always.
[1:37:01] me you don't have with you always. And
[1:37:04] Karl Marx's philosophy of from every man
[1:37:07] according to his ability and to every
[1:37:08] man according to his need did not get
[1:37:10] rid of Jesus Christ statement that the
[1:37:11] poor you have with you always. The
[1:37:13] Soviet Union definitely had the poor.
[1:37:16] However, I could go to one place which
[1:37:18] is Shushinskoy in central Siberia just
[1:37:20] above the Mongolian border in the
[1:37:21] mountains and find that I could feed
[1:37:23] four people at the restaurant for about
[1:37:25] nine bucks US and they were quite full.
[1:37:28] And then I went up the road on the Trans
[1:37:29] Siberian railway to Kimiero and it cost
[1:37:32] N bucks just for one person because in
[1:37:35] that city everybody had a job. In the
[1:37:37] other city they don't. So um putting in
[1:37:40] perspective that's Shushinsko is one of
[1:37:42] the places where we send humanitarian
[1:37:44] aid stuff to. Um anyway, when I was at
[1:37:48] these meetings in Russia, I thought,
[1:37:49] well, you know what, it there's been a
[1:37:51] financial crisis in in uh globally and
[1:37:54] uh things have changed. So, it's it's
[1:37:58] it's um well, this church of all
[1:38:01] churches knows what the differences in
[1:38:03] culture is like. We have a lot of
[1:38:04] cultures that sit here and uh even from
[1:38:06] Canada to the United States, it's a
[1:38:07] difference in culture. People think
[1:38:09] differently. They respond differently to
[1:38:10] different things. And um it's tough to
[1:38:14] try to get information from east block
[1:38:16] countries from an email or you ask them
[1:38:19] you know how's it going what's happening
[1:38:22] um and it's oh don't worry about it
[1:38:23] brother Lord always looks after us
[1:38:24] everything's just fine it's like that's
[1:38:26] why not not the question that I asked
[1:38:27] you I need to know what's going on and I
[1:38:30] don't it's just really hard so
[1:38:32] consequently I thought well you know
[1:38:33] what here's the golden opportunity
[1:38:35] there'll be a lot of brothers there from
[1:38:36] all over I can find out what's going on
[1:38:38] so anyway
[1:38:40] Um
[1:38:44] let's see
[1:38:47] some places in Russia weren't affected
[1:38:48] at all by the international problem of
[1:38:51] the the big monetary fund situation and
[1:38:54] uh some places were completely
[1:38:56] devastated. So the kind of scenario we
[1:38:59] had as far as economic crisis is
[1:39:00] concerned in 2001
[1:39:02] uh where people were out of work, the
[1:39:04] churches were kind of putting together
[1:39:06] money to even be able to feed some
[1:39:07] families. Uh they couldn't afford, you
[1:39:09] know, clothes for their children. Um
[1:39:11] that kind of thing. There was some
[1:39:13] places that are right back in exactly
[1:39:15] the same situation again. Um Ukraine
[1:39:18] still seems to be uh probably the
[1:39:20] highest on that priority list. Ukraine
[1:39:22] has really got hit really hard. I asked
[1:39:24] brother Victor from Nova Kaznetsk. said,
[1:39:25] "Um, did the economic crisis affect any
[1:39:28] of the folks in the church there?" And
[1:39:30] he just smiled at me and said, "Well,"
[1:39:32] he said, "we're poor people, so we
[1:39:33] didn't notice." So, it uh they're
[1:39:37] actually doing they weren't doing bad
[1:39:38] then and not doing bad now. Um just a
[1:39:41] quick note that from 2001 to 2009
[1:39:45] this particular project whether it's
[1:39:47] been uh you know assisted with uh men of
[1:39:50] vision or Bible believers um we've spent
[1:39:54] just a bit over $37,000
[1:39:57] and we've shipped just a little right
[1:40:00] around 36
[1:40:02] uh metric tons of clothing to the east
[1:40:05] block countries. That's about 80,000 lbs
[1:40:08] of clothes. uh it's around 17 or 1,800
[1:40:12] boxes of clothes. Um in perspective, uh
[1:40:16] you know, the United States has 309
[1:40:18] million people. Uh Russia's got 142
[1:40:21] million. Canada's only got 34 million.
[1:40:25] But in as far as land area is concerned,
[1:40:27] Russia's number one, Canada's number
[1:40:28] two, US is number three. Okay? It's a
[1:40:31] big place. Uh Russia's huge. It's twice
[1:40:35] the size of Canada. Uh, if you took the
[1:40:37] lower 48 from Seattle to New York,
[1:40:39] you've got four time zones. Russia's got
[1:40:42] 11. Okay? It's a big place and it's very
[1:40:46] difficult to get stuff around. If I send
[1:40:47] a box today, it'll arrive about 8 months
[1:40:50] later. Okay? It takes a long time to get
[1:40:53] things from here to there. Um, it rushes
[1:40:55] forever changing the rules all the time.
[1:40:58] uh some printers that I sent for brother
[1:41:00] Kim a year and a couple of months ago,
[1:41:03] 14 months ago, I think it is. They're
[1:41:05] stuck in Germany because they changed
[1:41:06] all the rules. So, uh it can take a long
[1:41:09] time. It uh right now it takes about it
[1:41:12] takes $2.60 US to get a box, well, the
[1:41:15] best per pound of what's ever in a box
[1:41:18] to Russia.
[1:41:20] Takes 79 cents to get it to the Ukraine.
[1:41:22] So, the Ukraine tends to get more. So,
[1:41:25] um I know that we have um I I haven't
[1:41:28] made a shipment because, you know, with
[1:41:29] with the economic crisis in the United
[1:41:31] States and Canada and well Europe and
[1:41:33] everything else, um there's less
[1:41:35] disposable income for a lot of people
[1:41:37] here too because there's places here
[1:41:39] that were impacted really hard and other
[1:41:41] places not so much like the British
[1:41:43] Columbia is not doing too bad and um but
[1:41:46] it it when you don't have disposable
[1:41:47] income uh you know offerings are a
[1:41:50] little harder to make sometimes and that
[1:41:52] kind of stuff. So, we've got enough
[1:41:53] money together to make another shipment,
[1:41:55] which I'll do on Tuesday. I was supposed
[1:41:56] to do it Saturday, but they they had to
[1:41:58] cancel on me, the other group. And, uh,
[1:42:00] so, um, but that'd be the first shipment
[1:42:02] I've made since September of last year.
[1:42:04] And, uh, I only wanted to mention that
[1:42:06] when I was in the meetings,
[1:42:09] well, brother Vladimir, uh, Royabove,
[1:42:13] who's the pastor in Daetsk, um, I got a
[1:42:16] chance to talk to a lot of different
[1:42:17] ministers, what was going on in their
[1:42:18] churches, kind of get the feel of
[1:42:19] things. Uh, brother Vladimir simply told
[1:42:22] me that when they heard about the
[1:42:23] economic crisis,
[1:42:25] first thing the brothers went was,
[1:42:26] "Well, there goes that source." Um,
[1:42:29] we'll probably won't see anything else
[1:42:31] show up. And, uh, about 3 weeks later,
[1:42:36] there came a bunch of boxes. And they
[1:42:38] were really grateful. They, well, well,
[1:42:39] that's probably the end of it. And then
[1:42:41] a couple of months later, another bunch
[1:42:43] of boxes. And so uh and he said the
[1:42:45] brothers were really surprised quite
[1:42:46] actually that um that the believers here
[1:42:49] were still giving. And um by the time
[1:42:52] the fourth set of boxes had come uh they
[1:42:55] were just like really really amazed. And
[1:42:57] I told him I says well it's been a
[1:42:59] little while since I've done it. So I
[1:43:00] said so there's going to be a gap but
[1:43:03] you know but God willing we'll still be
[1:43:04] sending some things. He did mention to
[1:43:06] me that there was a family there uh well
[1:43:08] not more than one family there. They
[1:43:09] haven't had work of any kind in over a
[1:43:13] year.
[1:43:14] And the church is taking up offerings to
[1:43:16] be able to buy them food to eat. And so
[1:43:19] in order to put clothes on their
[1:43:20] children and in order to have shoes,
[1:43:22] because of course walking is what they
[1:43:24] do primarily if they live in the city
[1:43:25] because owning a vehicle is excessively
[1:43:27] expensive. Um
[1:43:30] if it wasn't for what we sent them, they
[1:43:32] wouldn't have it. Just that simple. And
[1:43:34] uh he said they have been extremely
[1:43:36] grateful for what they've been getting.
[1:43:38] Um
[1:43:41] let me take a look at my notes here. Let
[1:43:42] me see if I forgot anything. Um,
[1:43:50] now I'm going to get in trouble for
[1:43:51] doing this, but I'm going to do it
[1:43:52] anyway. Um, you always get in trouble
[1:43:54] for doing these kinds of things cuz I
[1:43:56] might forget somebody, but if I did,
[1:43:57] well, you'll forgive me. I'm sure I have
[1:43:59] to ask the people that I'm going to
[1:44:00] really impose upon to forgive me as
[1:44:02] well. So, um, I walked into the church
[1:44:06] when we first, Brother Randy, show you
[1:44:07] the picture. We went from the airport
[1:44:08] straight to the church. And when I
[1:44:10] walked into the church, a brother
[1:44:11] stepped out of a of a room. He's going
[1:44:13] to be he's watching me. I know he's
[1:44:14] watching me. He told me he was going to
[1:44:16] be doing this. So, and he just went,
[1:44:18] "Oh, praise the Lord. Brother Drake is
[1:44:20] here." And I went, I don't know this
[1:44:23] guy. Who's this guy? And then I said,
[1:44:25] "Oh, he's familiar." I think I remember
[1:44:27] seeing a picture of him once. Is one of
[1:44:29] the translators, Brother Dimma. He
[1:44:31] actually translated for Brother Gird
[1:44:33] Rudol during the preaching services.
[1:44:35] Come to find out, as many of the
[1:44:38] brothers and sisters all knew who I was
[1:44:40] because they know, oh yeah, you sit on
[1:44:42] the right hand side of the church about
[1:44:43] two to three seats back on the and I'm
[1:44:45] going, "Oh, okay. Yeah, yeah, oh, we
[1:44:47] really miss you when you're not there.
[1:44:48] That's okay." So, they serve they stream
[1:44:50] all of our services. So, they're going
[1:44:51] to be streaming now. But there's
[1:44:53] something that I always get I I feel
[1:44:55] guilty about. I feel really bad about.
[1:44:56] And that's the fact that when I go over
[1:44:58] there or when I'm corresponding with
[1:45:00] them, it's like I'm the guy that's doing
[1:45:02] all this stuff. Well, I'm not. And so
[1:45:05] therefore, for those that are streaming,
[1:45:07] I want you to be watching very
[1:45:09] carefully. I would like to have the Ron
[1:45:12] Caldwell family stand up, please.
[1:45:18] And I'd like to have the Revas family
[1:45:19] stand up, please.
[1:45:23] Sister Gail, can you stand up?
[1:45:27] Ah, can I have the Weber family stand
[1:45:28] up, please?
[1:45:32] Got one, two, three. And I want my
[1:45:33] family to stand up, please, too, cuz
[1:45:34] they're Americans as well, believe it or
[1:45:36] not. There we go. So, for those of you
[1:45:40] that are looking on the streaming, these
[1:45:42] are the people that put the clothes in
[1:45:43] the box, and without them, this thing
[1:45:45] could simply wouldn't take place.
[1:45:47] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:45:48] &gt;&gt; And I want to thank you all for that.
[1:45:52] God bless you.
[1:45:55] Amen.
[1:46:00] Amen. Thank you, brother Richard. I've
[1:46:02] uh with printing and toner and all those
[1:46:06] things, you know, I encourage brother
[1:46:07] Richard, make sure you keep sending to
[1:46:09] sending clothes to the Ukraine and to
[1:46:11] Russia and those places cuz I need to
[1:46:13] fill the boxes with toner because the
[1:46:16] brothers in those countries need
[1:46:17] supplies for their printers. um as well
[1:46:20] in Moscow. One of the one of one of my
[1:46:23] main reasons for being there, a number
[1:46:24] of the people who have have already
[1:46:27] received print stations uh were at the
[1:46:29] meetings and we did some training with
[1:46:31] them as well. There was another brother,
[1:46:33] brother Victor from Siberia that came
[1:46:35] and was looking for a print station. We
[1:46:37] met brother Pavville, some of you know
[1:46:39] who he is, brother Nikolai's son in uh
[1:46:42] in Israel and he specifically asked
[1:46:44] there's a brother way up in Siberia that
[1:46:46] needs a print station for his
[1:46:47] congregation. he's going to be at the
[1:46:48] meeting. So that's why we took printers
[1:46:50] again to Russia. Um there's about 15
[1:46:53] print stations throughout through the
[1:46:55] throughout that region of the world,
[1:46:56] Latvia, Lithuania, Ukraine, and Russia.
[1:46:59] So there's about 15 print stations there
[1:47:01] now. I was busy in the basement on on
[1:47:04] the Sunday morning um and Sunday
[1:47:06] afternoon printing books. And you know,
[1:47:09] I've I've gone around the world and you
[1:47:11] know, some people say to you, "Well, I
[1:47:12] don't know why you print these books.
[1:47:13] Nobody needs them." So, so we started
[1:47:17] the printer Sunday morning while brother
[1:47:19] Bisc was printing was preaching. I got
[1:47:21] it all set up and I started I started
[1:47:22] the printer going and I just went until
[1:47:25] I ran out of paper. I printed um 80some
[1:47:27] books and I didn't have any left to show
[1:47:29] anybody what a book looks like. I mean
[1:47:30] as fast as we could print them, people
[1:47:31] were taking them and going with them.
[1:47:33] So, so there's a real need. So, we what
[1:47:35] we did was set up the Moscow church as
[1:47:39] kind of a center. We spend significant
[1:47:41] time with the brothers there teaching
[1:47:42] them how to set up computers and print
[1:47:44] books and all of that and get the
[1:47:46] messages up onto the hub and and they
[1:47:49] will act as a depot now so that anybody
[1:47:51] in that region of the world, anybody
[1:47:52] from Russia that needs a print station
[1:47:54] will travel to Moscow and and pick up a
[1:47:57] print station and get their training and
[1:47:59] all that. And then we'll be sending
[1:48:00] supplies into Moscow and that's where
[1:48:02] they'll that's where they'll get all
[1:48:03] their supplies. So, we basically set it
[1:48:05] up there as a as a center for that for
[1:48:07] that whole region where print stations
[1:48:09] will go out. So, if we can have the uh
[1:48:12] overhead back, I'd like to I'd like to
[1:48:15] talk to you about Indonesia.
[1:48:18] Um, when we left when we left the uh
[1:48:22] when we left Israel, you know, my wife
[1:48:24] doesn't particularly like to travel
[1:48:26] internationally. Some of you know that.
[1:48:28] And so when we when we left Israel, you
[1:48:31] know, and my wife found out that I was
[1:48:33] going this way and she was going this
[1:48:35] way, she was not really happy that I was
[1:48:36] stranding her in the Middle East, you
[1:48:38] know, and abandoning her. And I said,
[1:48:40] "This is really easy. You get on the
[1:48:42] airplane, you fly to Zurich, you wait in
[1:48:44] the airport 2 hours, you get on another
[1:48:45] airplane, you get off that one, you'll
[1:48:46] be at home, your daughter will be at the
[1:48:47] airport waiting for you." Simple, right?
[1:48:51] &gt;&gt; Till she got to Zurich.
[1:48:52] &gt;&gt; Yeah. and there'd been a volcano and she
[1:48:54] got to spend 5 days in Xerx changing
[1:48:56] hotels every day because they were all
[1:48:58] busy and all all all that she had. So in
[1:49:00] the meantime I went in the opposite
[1:49:02] direction and went to Asia to spend time
[1:49:03] there before going to Moscow. So
[1:49:07] the plan already was that I would fly
[1:49:09] all night Thursday and all day Friday
[1:49:13] and I would get a nice hotel and have a
[1:49:14] nice rest on on Friday night and then
[1:49:17] fly Indonesia early in the morning
[1:49:19] Saturday. But I got a call from my wife
[1:49:21] when I hit uh when I hit Singapore to
[1:49:23] say I'm stranded in Zurich. I don't have
[1:49:25] a flight. I don't have a hotel. So I
[1:49:27] spent all that night trying to make
[1:49:28] connections for her. So then I then I
[1:49:32] went straight from doing that straight
[1:49:34] onto the airplane and straight into
[1:49:35] Indonesia. So when I hit Indonesia, I
[1:49:37] had been I hadn't seen a bed in 3 days.
[1:49:39] Like I it had been from essentially
[1:49:42] Thursday morning and it was now Saturday
[1:49:44] morning. and and uh the brothers were so
[1:49:46] excited to see me because you know they
[1:49:48] knew I was bringing you a print station
[1:49:49] and whatnot. So they again you know how
[1:49:51] it is you you you you feel like going
[1:49:53] and hiding somewhere but they took me
[1:49:55] straight to the church. Okay, let's get
[1:49:57] set up and let's get training, right? So
[1:49:59] and we had to do that because I only had
[1:50:01] three days there, you know, Saturday,
[1:50:03] Sunday, Monday and my flight went out
[1:50:04] Monday night. So, we right away went
[1:50:07] over there and we had a lot to cover.
[1:50:09] The in in the pictures here up in the in
[1:50:11] the top corner, you see brother Eto in
[1:50:13] the in the red shirt. Um, I think he
[1:50:16] probably weighs about 85 lbs. He's quite
[1:50:19] a quite quite a thin man. Um, but again,
[1:50:22] he's absolutely convinced that this
[1:50:25] message is the truth. He's 37 years old.
[1:50:28] He has a little congregation. He
[1:50:30] pastors. He's translated 78 messages
[1:50:34] into Indonesian. And let me tell you
[1:50:36] about Indonesia. Indonesia is the
[1:50:37] highest populated Muslim country in the
[1:50:40] world. Very high percentage of Muslim
[1:50:42] people and that's who he works among. Um
[1:50:45] he's translated 78 messages. They have a
[1:50:48] radio broadcast every Sunday night. A
[1:50:50] halfhour radio broadcast and they get
[1:50:52] between 50 to 100 letters every week
[1:50:56] from the radio broadcast. It reaches
[1:50:58] over most of Indonesia. And you know
[1:51:01] we've been trying to get a print station
[1:51:03] to them. we've been talking via email
[1:51:05] because with the with the radio
[1:51:08] broadcast they get all these letters but
[1:51:10] they don't have sufficient material to
[1:51:12] to give them anything. They have nothing
[1:51:13] to give them because they have no they
[1:51:15] have no way to print books. They have
[1:51:16] nothing. So we set up the print station
[1:51:20] and we set up that print station and the
[1:51:22] books started coming off the print
[1:51:24] station. Uh, brother Eto, his trustee,
[1:51:26] and his song leader were all standing
[1:51:27] there watching this, and these were men
[1:51:29] that were 35, 40 years old, and they
[1:51:32] were giggling like little school girls.
[1:51:35] They just stood there and giggled. They
[1:51:37] giggled uncontrollably. And they're
[1:51:39] holding these books and
[1:51:41] I mean, they were just so excited
[1:51:43] because because what it was to them was
[1:51:46] they have a stack of letters to answer
[1:51:49] &gt;&gt; and now in each one, they can put this
[1:51:50] little book and they can send a little
[1:51:52] book to each one of these people. And so
[1:51:55] when you see the impact that the message
[1:51:57] hub, you know, to be able to put the
[1:51:59] message into people's hands, you know,
[1:52:02] they have a burden,
[1:52:04] &gt;&gt; you know, I don't go there to preach.
[1:52:06] &gt;&gt; I go there as a servant to the ministry.
[1:52:09] And I tell them that right when I get
[1:52:10] there, as soon as I get there, they say,
[1:52:11] "Okay, we're having a service tonight
[1:52:13] and you're preaching." And I just say,
[1:52:14] "No, I'm not. I'm here to serve you. I'm
[1:52:16] here to hear you preach." Right? And it
[1:52:18] is a little bit of a privilege that I
[1:52:20] have because often when you travel with
[1:52:22] ministry, you never get to hear the
[1:52:24] local ministers preach. If I traveled
[1:52:26] overseas with brother Tom, I'd hear
[1:52:28] Brother Tom preach, which is okay. I'm
[1:52:30] I'm okay with that. But often you don't
[1:52:32] get to hear the local ministry preach.
[1:52:34] And and so I had the privilege of
[1:52:36] hearing brother Eto preach on Sunday.
[1:52:38] And this is a message believer. Straight
[1:52:40] up hardcore message believer. I mean I
[1:52:42] mean there was nowhere you could go and
[1:52:45] fellowship with him in the message where
[1:52:46] he just wasn't right there with you, you
[1:52:48] know. So and and and he's absolutely
[1:52:50] convinced. And so what what we've done
[1:52:53] now, I talked to him about what we're
[1:52:54] doing with our young people here. You
[1:52:57] know, many of you know that our young
[1:52:58] people have been engaged here in
[1:53:00] transcribing the message and formatting
[1:53:02] the message. And I want to hand out a
[1:53:03] little bouquet here. You know, Brother
[1:53:05] Brandham talks about how God can get
[1:53:07] more done with one man surrender than he
[1:53:08] can with a whole army. Right.
[1:53:11] &gt;&gt; Well, recently we had a situation where
[1:53:12] we had to we we had to format 150
[1:53:16] messages to get the last 150 messages in
[1:53:18] English up on the hub. So, we put it
[1:53:21] before the young people. One young man
[1:53:25] who's how old is he? 17. One 17-year-old
[1:53:29] man did 115 of them in two weeks. He had
[1:53:32] two weeks off school. During that time,
[1:53:35] he flew, he went to camp. It was our
[1:53:37] brother Timothy Andes. And he basically
[1:53:39] did 115 messages in that time. You know,
[1:53:43] that's not to take away from what
[1:53:44] everybody else did. The rest got the
[1:53:46] rest of the message up. They transcribed
[1:53:48] transcribed other messages. And if they
[1:53:51] were if you were waiting for me to try
[1:53:53] and get those sever, you know, three or
[1:53:55] 4 hundred messages that we got up in the
[1:53:56] hub, you'd still be waiting. I'm busy.
[1:53:59] And so, you know, engaging the young
[1:54:02] people.
[1:54:02] &gt;&gt; Amen. You know, I I you know, you get in
[1:54:05] these countries and and and of course
[1:54:07] they look at you and you're I'll say
[1:54:09] like this, they look at you and you're
[1:54:10] old and you've been in the message a
[1:54:11] long time and so they want to ask you a
[1:54:12] whole bunch of questions, you know. So
[1:54:14] there was a young man asked me that
[1:54:16] asked me a question at the young
[1:54:18] people's meeting here in Indonesia. And
[1:54:19] he said, um, brother Kim, um, and it was
[1:54:22] through through brother ET Talk was
[1:54:23] interpreting. He says, "Brother Kim," he
[1:54:24] says, "I go to university. I've got a
[1:54:27] job. I just don't have time to read the
[1:54:28] message." you know, he said, "What what
[1:54:30] what should I do?" And I looked at him
[1:54:33] and I said, "You ever been in love?"
[1:54:36] And he was sitting among our young
[1:54:37] people. And apparently that's that's a
[1:54:39] little bit embarrassing to ask in front
[1:54:40] of all the young people. I said, "Cuz
[1:54:42] the day you get to be in love, you're
[1:54:44] going to be the guy sitting there in the
[1:54:46] classroom with your telephone underneath
[1:54:47] the edge texting her, and you're going
[1:54:50] to find time in the evening to spend two
[1:54:51] hours with her. You just need to fall in
[1:54:54] love with this, and you'll find time for
[1:54:56] it." And I told him, I said, "When the
[1:54:58] professor, when you're in a class in the
[1:55:00] university and you got your textbook
[1:55:02] here and the professor is talking about
[1:55:03] something you're not particularly
[1:55:04] interested in, take this little
[1:55:05] pocketbook and put it inside and you can
[1:55:08] just read this little pocketbook with
[1:55:09] your textbook on the outside."
[1:55:12] I shared that with brother Isaac in
[1:55:14] India and he said, "That's how I got
[1:55:16] through university." He said,
[1:55:20] "And so if that's what you know, what
[1:55:23] whatever your priorities are, wherever
[1:55:25] your heart is, as brother Tom said this
[1:55:27] morning, that's what you're going to
[1:55:28] find time to do."
[1:55:29] &gt;&gt; So we we met, you'll see me sitting
[1:55:31] there with a whole group of their young
[1:55:33] people and we met with their young
[1:55:35] people in the afternoon on Sunday
[1:55:37] afternoon. We spent five hours with them
[1:55:39] and talked to them about translating
[1:55:41] because I talked to brother Eto and I
[1:55:42] said, "How many messages are you getting
[1:55:43] done right now?" Well, he said, ' With
[1:55:45] all my responsibilities, it's really
[1:55:46] tough to get more than one a month done.
[1:55:48] I said, 'Well, what if you engaged all
[1:55:50] the young people? I said, most of them I
[1:55:52] can talk to, so they speak English, and
[1:55:54] what if they did the first few levels of
[1:55:56] translating? They could translate it.
[1:55:57] They could proofread among them, and
[1:55:59] then you do the last part of it. And and
[1:56:01] and he caught it right away. He caught
[1:56:03] it. He said, "If we did that, we could
[1:56:04] get four or five a month done." Right?
[1:56:06] And so, that's what they've done since
[1:56:08] I've been there. They've done four
[1:56:09] messages. Um they sent me the first one
[1:56:12] uh the revelation of uh um revelations
[1:56:16] chapter 5 or bruise serpent. They did
[1:56:17] this they did this message. It's now
[1:56:20] ready to go up in the hub all formatted
[1:56:21] and going and they're you know he has a
[1:56:23] group of of of a half a dozen young
[1:56:26] people from the ages of about 18 to 22
[1:56:28] and they're all full of energy and
[1:56:30] they're just excited to be engaged in
[1:56:31] this project. And so they're busy
[1:56:33] translating, getting the message up,
[1:56:35] printing the small books and it's just a
[1:56:37] little factory going on there. Since we
[1:56:39] left, they told me that they have, you
[1:56:41] know, I've only been home for, I don't
[1:56:42] know what has it been, 2 weeks, 3 weeks,
[1:56:44] and they told me that they've printed
[1:56:46] now five different titles, 200 of each
[1:56:48] book. So, they've printed over a
[1:56:49] thousand books since we left with the
[1:56:50] print station.
[1:56:52] &gt;&gt; So, I know that they're going to be
[1:56:53] looking for consumables right away. I
[1:56:55] got an email that I I I meant to bring
[1:56:57] here tonight and forgot from Brother
[1:56:58] ETO, who wanted to express the thanks
[1:57:00] for the people here. With Brother Eto,
[1:57:03] you know, they're busy with translating.
[1:57:05] And I asked him, I said, "Would you like
[1:57:07] us to support the translating?" I said,
[1:57:08] "We could offer some financial
[1:57:10] assistance for the translating." And he
[1:57:12] said, "No." He said, "I had a meeting
[1:57:13] with the ministers throughout Indonesia.
[1:57:15] There's about eight churches throughout
[1:57:17] Indonesia." He said, "I had a meeting
[1:57:19] with the brothers recently, and he said,
[1:57:20] I think it would be wrong for us to take
[1:57:22] support for translating. We need to
[1:57:24] support this ourselves from our own
[1:57:25] churches." So, I I literally we we left
[1:57:29] him a print station. I couldn't give him
[1:57:31] any financial support. He wouldn't
[1:57:32] accept it from me. And so when you see a
[1:57:35] situation like this, he sent me an
[1:57:36] email. Since I've been gone, he's been
[1:57:38] at a minister's meeting. And at the
[1:57:40] minister's meeting, they've they've kind
[1:57:41] of figured out what they need for
[1:57:42] Indonesia. They need another three print
[1:57:44] stations. Well, you know, three more
[1:57:47] print stations is about $3,500. So, I'm
[1:57:50] going to speak about a few needs
[1:57:51] tonight. They need three more print
[1:57:53] stations in Indonesia to be able to
[1:57:55] cover the whole country and be able to
[1:57:57] get books to everywhere they need. And
[1:57:59] when you see that and when you see their
[1:58:01] ambition and their desire to get this
[1:58:03] word out and they're only asking for a
[1:58:05] little bit of help, right? You want to
[1:58:07] get behind that. You know, it's
[1:58:09] something I learned from Brother Biscll
[1:58:10] and from Brother Hildebrand, my former
[1:58:12] pastor, is find somebody who's doing
[1:58:14] something and see what you can do to
[1:58:15] help them. You know, as opposed to
[1:58:17] trying to find somebody who's not doing
[1:58:19] anything and say, you know, do you want
[1:58:21] to do something? Find somebody who's
[1:58:22] doing all he can and then do what you
[1:58:24] can to enable him.
[1:58:26] So, Indonesia was was was quite an
[1:58:29] exciting trip. Um, we, like I say, I was
[1:58:32] only there for 3 days. The Saturday that
[1:58:33] I was there training, we were we were
[1:58:35] training the same as Brother Timothy's
[1:58:37] been doing on uh on Monday evenings. And
[1:58:39] those of you who haven't been there
[1:58:40] should be there. Monday evenings,
[1:58:42] Brother Timothy is training people how
[1:58:44] to format the messages. We need to get a
[1:58:46] thousand of these reformatted into this
[1:58:48] small size. Who said they'd like to have
[1:58:51] one of these?
[1:58:53] Just about as many still want to have
[1:58:55] one.
[1:58:56] And so the if you've got a computer and
[1:58:59] a little bit of time, you can do these
[1:59:01] reformats and and get these up onto the
[1:59:03] hub so they're available. We don't only
[1:59:05] want to do the English on the message
[1:59:06] hub today. There's about 4500 messages
[1:59:09] as we if we total up all the different
[1:59:11] languages and how many books. We want to
[1:59:13] format them all in this small size for
[1:59:15] everybody around the world. So it's a
[1:59:18] big job. There's there's there's much to
[1:59:19] be done. So when I was training the
[1:59:22] brothers though, brother Timothy, you
[1:59:23] know what it's like. So, I was training
[1:59:24] the brothers on how to do the formatting
[1:59:27] and like I say, it had been three days
[1:59:28] since I'd had a bed. So, I would show
[1:59:30] them, okay, you format like this and you
[1:59:32] do like this. Okay, now you do it and
[1:59:33] I'll watch.
[1:59:35] And then and then I then I realized I
[1:59:37] was snoring.
[1:59:39] And they felt it quite humorous because
[1:59:41] they would they would try it. Okay, now
[1:59:43] when they got it right, they'd wake me
[1:59:44] up and say, "Okay, do we have it right?
[1:59:45] Yes, you got it right. Okay, let's do
[1:59:47] the next step." And that's kind of how
[1:59:48] our Saturday session went.
[1:59:51] So um it was just a wonderful time to be
[1:59:54] with them. Um you know the the the
[1:59:56] church where that brother Eto is
[1:59:58] pastoring recently split off from a
[2:00:00] larger church and the way that happened
[2:00:03] in Indonesia they can't have a church
[2:00:05] that has more than 70 people in it.
[2:00:07] There's government laws around that and
[2:00:09] so uh they had a church that was kind of
[2:00:11] growing just over that size and there
[2:00:13] was a whole group of people that had
[2:00:14] come to the message recently on the
[2:00:17] other side of the city from where the
[2:00:18] church was. So they just agreed it would
[2:00:21] be better for brother Eto to go over
[2:00:22] there and start a church over there and
[2:00:25] uh and the pastor actually came over and
[2:00:27] preached the dedication services. It was
[2:00:28] it was quite a nice atmosphere and uh so
[2:00:32] so he's over there with u the other
[2:00:34] outside of himself the longest anybody's
[2:00:37] been in the message in his church is two
[2:00:38] years and most of them are under a year
[2:00:40] and so they're very enthusiastic.
[2:00:42] They're they're I I expect to just see
[2:00:44] exponential growth there. They're
[2:00:46] they've got the radio broadcast. The the
[2:00:48] young people are out on the street
[2:00:49] witnessing. You know, I was listening to
[2:00:50] Brother Biscll talking about what we did
[2:00:54] when when we first got the message 30
[2:00:55] years ago. And that's what's that's the
[2:00:58] atmosphere that you find in in in
[2:01:00] Indonesia today.
[2:01:02] So then uh the the printer that got
[2:01:04] mixed up in uh in Israel and kind of got
[2:01:07] rooted all over the place showed up
[2:01:09] Monday morning and I was leaving Monday
[2:01:11] afternoon. So we trained on the
[2:01:13] formatting on Saturday. Sunday we spent
[2:01:15] service with them and uh between
[2:01:17] spending service with them, teaching
[2:01:19] some new songs, they taught me some new
[2:01:20] songs they like to bring to the
[2:01:22] congregation over time. And then and
[2:01:24] then Monday we went to the airport to
[2:01:26] find this printer that kind of got got
[2:01:28] there late behind me. And uh I looked at
[2:01:30] the we went into the airport and they
[2:01:32] said, "No, no, it hasn't arrived." And I
[2:01:33] looked in the corner and there it was.
[2:01:34] It was on a on a cart over there in the
[2:01:36] corner. And I said to brother ET, I
[2:01:37] said, "Okay, that's my printer over
[2:01:39] there. We're just going to go get it.
[2:01:40] We're going to head straight out the
[2:01:41] door. We're not talking to anybody."
[2:01:43] because we didn't have time. We only had
[2:01:44] a couple hours and I had to fly away and
[2:01:46] I had to train them how to use it. So
[2:01:48] that's basically what we did. We just
[2:01:50] got the cart and we just headed straight
[2:01:51] for the door. And a customs guy just as
[2:01:54] I was going out the door looked at me
[2:01:55] and says, "What's in that box?" I said,
[2:01:57] "A printer." And I just kept out the
[2:01:59] door we went and away we
[2:02:03] went. So uh that's pretty much how we
[2:02:05] got around the world with that uh with
[2:02:07] that equipment. Um, so we just had a
[2:02:11] wonderful time and that's that that is a
[2:02:13] group of people that you know that you
[2:02:16] meet that are they're on fire. You just
[2:02:18] want to do what you can. So what I
[2:02:20] committed to them, we're going to find a
[2:02:22] way to get them three more print
[2:02:23] stations. We're going to find a way to
[2:02:25] get get them there. We're going to find
[2:02:27] a way to supply them with their toner.
[2:02:29] You know, to print a regular size book
[2:02:32] costs about 7 cents for paper and about
[2:02:34] about 5 cents for toner to print a book
[2:02:37] like this. and there's no postage. So,
[2:02:39] we're going to find a way to ship toner
[2:02:42] to them to be able to supply them with
[2:02:43] their consumables on an ongoing basis to
[2:02:45] supply those print stations. And that's
[2:02:47] the only thing I could give him. There
[2:02:49] was nothing else I could give him. He
[2:02:50] said, "No, no, we're going to do the
[2:02:51] paper. Um, no, we don't want any support
[2:02:54] for translation. We're going to do it
[2:02:55] ourselves. They're going to engage the
[2:02:56] young people." And then just after I
[2:02:58] left, brother ET talk went to a
[2:03:00] ministers meeting and engaged all the
[2:03:02] other churches to do the same thing and
[2:03:04] really get the ministers in each church
[2:03:06] committing to a couple of messages every
[2:03:08] month. And we're going to see growth of
[2:03:09] that in Indonesia like like crazy.
[2:03:12] So it was a it was a wonderful time in
[2:03:15] Indonesia. Can I have the next slide,
[2:03:16] please?
[2:03:18] From there, we went to India and uh and
[2:03:23] India was was a was a challenge. Um it
[2:03:26] was a it was a little different
[2:03:27] situation. The pictures that you see
[2:03:29] here on the top of there you'll see the
[2:03:32] room where the inventory was stored of
[2:03:34] books in India. Um a year ago there was
[2:03:38] a little over a million books in stock
[2:03:40] in Chennai. Just a lot of books that
[2:03:43] were there because in in the model that
[2:03:45] was happening in Chennai
[2:03:47] u maybe just go to the next slide and
[2:03:48] then we'll come back to this one. We had
[2:03:50] the big H highidleberg press. I think
[2:03:52] you've all seen pictures of it over the
[2:03:54] years and the cutting and folding
[2:03:56] equipment and stapler and all that. And
[2:03:58] basically that press by the time you
[2:04:00] turn it on and turn it off, you get a
[2:04:01] thousand books out of the back of it,
[2:04:02] right? So you can't print small orders.
[2:04:05] So basically what would happen is, you
[2:04:07] know, someone would translate a book,
[2:04:09] they would then print several thousand
[2:04:11] copies knowing that that book won't be
[2:04:13] printed again for years. And then so you
[2:04:16] had to have you had to have a stock of
[2:04:17] books so that when people ordered that
[2:04:19] book again, you could you could fill
[2:04:21] that. So you know we're working in 13
[2:04:23] different languages in India. Some
[2:04:25] languages have as many as as 120 titles
[2:04:28] or 170 titles actually. So there's about
[2:04:31] you know 1,000 or,200 different titles
[2:04:33] available. And then if you start
[2:04:35] inventorying it takes up a lot of space.
[2:04:36] So go back to the previous slide. There
[2:04:38] was uh so there's actually two floors of
[2:04:41] the building. the the Glattus Dao
[2:04:43] Memorial Building um you know is a
[2:04:45] threetory three-story building about
[2:04:47] 3,000 square ft on each and two floors
[2:04:50] are just completely filled with
[2:04:51] inventory. And then the printing
[2:04:53] equipment is on the bottom floor. Um
[2:04:55] that's brother Moses there in the in the
[2:04:57] corner who who most of you know who he
[2:04:59] is. He's been managing the work there
[2:05:01] for a number of years. And so our really
[2:05:05] our challenge there in India was to say
[2:05:08] you know how do we make this a more
[2:05:10] efficient you know a more efficient way
[2:05:12] of doing things because when we looked
[2:05:13] in India we found that about 50% of all
[2:05:16] books that were being printed were being
[2:05:17] printed for inventory you know because
[2:05:20] you'd print enough to meet a book order
[2:05:24] let's say we're printing in Tamil and
[2:05:25] we've got 4,000 people that need to
[2:05:27] receive books so we maybe print about
[2:05:29] 5,000 and keep a thousand in stock and
[2:05:32] then believers believers are believers,
[2:05:34] you know, so they they really believe in
[2:05:36] the scripture that says ask largely that
[2:05:38] your joy might be full. So if you need
[2:05:40] if you need one book, you ask for two
[2:05:42] because you want to have one to give
[2:05:43] someone else as well. And so when we
[2:05:45] looked around India, we just found a lot
[2:05:47] of inventory and you know of the titles
[2:05:49] that were translated, there was there
[2:05:51] there was and still is a lot of books in
[2:05:53] inventory. But when you're trying to run
[2:05:56] a massive country like India that has
[2:05:58] you know a billion people um and you
[2:06:02] know 26 official languages it's really
[2:06:04] like 26 countries jammed together and
[2:06:06] you're trying to run that from a central
[2:06:08] location. It's difficult when somebody
[2:06:10] asks for books in Delhi you know well
[2:06:12] how many actually send them you haven't
[2:06:13] been there you don't really know. So, so
[2:06:16] consequently we were looking for a
[2:06:18] different model for for for how to how
[2:06:21] to work in India and and and really that
[2:06:23] model was the print station model. If we
[2:06:26] look at the Tamil language where they
[2:06:28] print maybe 5,000 books every time they
[2:06:30] do a book and they do maybe one new book
[2:06:32] a year in the region where the Tamil
[2:06:34] people live, you know, we can print
[2:06:36] about a thousand books a month on a
[2:06:38] print station quite comfortably. So if
[2:06:39] we put five print stations in that
[2:06:41] state, that would cover all the printing
[2:06:43] needs for that state. And therefore, you
[2:06:45] don't have shipping, you don't have
[2:06:47] inventory, you don't have all all of
[2:06:48] these issues. And so that was really
[2:06:51] what our challenge was. So we had uh we
[2:06:54] needed to move all of the inventory. If
[2:06:56] we can go to the next slide, we had to
[2:06:57] move all of the inventory um out. We had
[2:07:01] to sell all that printing equipment that
[2:07:03] you're looking at. And then the next
[2:07:04] slide. And so that's what we began to
[2:07:07] do. And to to move the inventory, what
[2:07:09] we did was talk to all of the different
[2:07:11] churches that spoke the Tamil language.
[2:07:13] And basically, we sent all that
[2:07:15] inventory to those churches and to those
[2:07:17] people that that are speaking that
[2:07:19] language. So, this is a group of
[2:07:21] brothers that were actually from brother
[2:07:22] Isaac's church. And brother Isaac has
[2:07:24] about 500 people in his church. And they
[2:07:27] basically just took 200 message of each
[2:07:28] title that we had in stock. He has a
[2:07:31] large church and was able to store it
[2:07:33] properly. So, they'll be able to
[2:07:34] continue distributing that. Um and so
[2:07:37] that was the books going out there. Um I
[2:07:39] couldn't do I you can't do a
[2:07:41] presentation on India without a picture
[2:07:42] of brother Swami and his wife. Um those
[2:07:44] of you who've been engaged with with
[2:07:47] with India. Um let me tell you this
[2:07:50] about brother Swami. Brother Swami is
[2:07:52] 88.
[2:07:54] He is a fiery preacher. He's engaged. He
[2:07:58] was in every meeting that I had when I
[2:07:59] was there. All the meetings about the
[2:08:00] print shop and just as sharp as attack.
[2:08:03] And so that tells me that we got at
[2:08:05] least another dozen years in our pastor.
[2:08:07] Amen.
[2:08:15] So yeah, brother I really enjoyed
[2:08:19] brother Swami you know anytime you talk
[2:08:21] with brother Swami you know he comes
[2:08:23] over and he sits beside you and he takes
[2:08:24] your hand and he holds your hand the
[2:08:26] whole time he's talking to you and
[2:08:27] explaining the his burden about getting
[2:08:30] the message out to people and he takes
[2:08:32] you by both hands and holds your hands
[2:08:34] and leans in and looks you right in the
[2:08:35] eye to make sure you understand what
[2:08:37] he's what where his heart is you know
[2:08:40] and And anytime he talks about brother
[2:08:43] Biscll, he gets tears in his eyes every
[2:08:45] time. Tell that man that I love him. You
[2:08:48] know, he's got such a gruff push. Tell
[2:08:50] that man that I love him. You know, and
[2:08:53] so we just really enjoyed Brother Swami
[2:08:55] and his wife. And this picture was an
[2:08:57] interesting picture. I was in his home
[2:08:59] and I said, "Brother Swami, I can't go
[2:09:00] home without a picture of you and your
[2:09:02] wife." And Sister Swami was pretty much
[2:09:04] like all of our wives are, "No, you're
[2:09:05] not taking my picture. No, no, no, no,
[2:09:07] no, no, no." And brother Swami just said
[2:09:09] come here and sit
[2:09:12] and she sat and smiled and we had the
[2:09:14] picture.
[2:09:17] So so it was a wonderful time there with
[2:09:19] the with brother Swami. Can I have the
[2:09:21] next slide? So we started shipping out
[2:09:23] books. Uh we don't have semis.
[2:09:26] This is how we ship out books. Um this
[2:09:29] is the auto rickshaw the cargo version.
[2:09:31] And uh I have no idea. I mean, you got
[2:09:34] to realize when you load that up thing
[2:09:35] up with books, it is very heavy. And
[2:09:38] then these things going out and and then
[2:09:40] traveling from there out to the
[2:09:42] different churches to to take the books
[2:09:44] out. Uh, next picture. Next slide.
[2:09:47] Sorry. So, this is now where the
[2:09:49] printing equipment used to be. We had to
[2:09:51] break up the floor in in front of the
[2:09:53] building. Those of you who have been
[2:09:54] there, we had to dig a big trench out in
[2:09:56] the front of the building actually to
[2:09:57] get the equipment out. So, we sold all
[2:10:00] of the equipment when I while I was
[2:10:01] there. It was sold. it was moved out of
[2:10:03] the building. The inventory was moved
[2:10:05] out. Um we listed the building for sale
[2:10:08] and the the reason that we did that is
[2:10:11] because the reason for having the
[2:10:13] building was because we had all this
[2:10:14] inventory that we had to carry and we
[2:10:16] don't need all that space. So the the
[2:10:18] the the the new model now is to sell the
[2:10:22] building and then take the money that we
[2:10:24] get from selling the building and put it
[2:10:25] into a trust account so that they can
[2:10:28] continue to the operation in India for
[2:10:30] many years from the from those funds.
[2:10:33] And so uh uh the next slide please.
[2:10:37] So the same time we were I don't know a
[2:10:41] diplomatic way to say this other than
[2:10:43] you know grinding the current operation
[2:10:45] down to a stump to really really rebuild
[2:10:47] and start again we were working with
[2:10:49] several brethren to install print
[2:10:52] stations and actually get them to take
[2:10:54] responsibility for the languages and the
[2:10:56] translating themselves. This is brother
[2:10:59] Freddy Gray. He lives in Haididerbad. He
[2:11:01] speaks Telugu and he's been working with
[2:11:03] the Telugu language. One of the things
[2:11:06] that we did both in Indonesia and Europe
[2:11:09] and India, everywhere we went, we
[2:11:12] borrowed Brother Murphy's model of how
[2:11:14] to get the messages in audio format.
[2:11:17] Now, I don't know if you realize it, but
[2:11:18] in the last few months, Brother Murphy's
[2:11:20] been when he came back from China last
[2:11:22] time, the Chinese believers really
[2:11:24] pressed them and they said, "We need
[2:11:25] more audio messages in Chinese." And so,
[2:11:28] Brother Murphy committed to do 80
[2:11:30] messages in 3 months.
[2:11:33] Now I expect to hear whoo after that
[2:11:35] because you know if you understand what
[2:11:37] kind of a commitment that is. I mean
[2:11:39] brother Murphy's days look like you know
[2:11:41] he goes up there and I I I hear him from
[2:11:44] downstairs you know when I used to be
[2:11:45] underneath him down here and I hear him
[2:11:47] and basically he listens to brother
[2:11:48] Brandham in one ear. He takes the
[2:11:50] translated book in his hand and he reads
[2:11:53] the book. But have you ever seen brother
[2:11:55] Murphy preach? You know he doesn't
[2:11:57] preach like this and he doesn't read
[2:11:59] like this either. All right. I mean, he
[2:12:02] preaches it under the same inspiration
[2:12:03] and anointing that brother Brandon
[2:12:05] brought it in. And and so then he does
[2:12:07] that in the morning. In the afternoon,
[2:12:09] he gets prepared for tomorrow's message.
[2:12:11] And the message goes to brother Ivan,
[2:12:12] brother Ivan edits it, and then they put
[2:12:15] it on a tape or on a on a CD with uh
[2:12:18] with brother Brandham on the right
[2:12:20] track, brother Murphy on the left track,
[2:12:23] and therefore the person that's
[2:12:24] listening to it can mix that however
[2:12:26] they want it. So there's some software
[2:12:28] involved in all that. So basically I had
[2:12:30] brother Ivan train me before I left so
[2:12:32] that I would know how to do it and I
[2:12:34] went overseas and with brother Eto we
[2:12:36] trained him and he's already laying down
[2:12:38] tracks. Uh the brothers in Croatia in
[2:12:42] India uh brother Isaac's church is doing
[2:12:44] it already. So they're doing the same
[2:12:46] thing because places like Indonesia you
[2:12:48] have a fairly high illiteracy rate as
[2:12:50] you do in India where 30 or 40% of the
[2:12:53] people that you want to hear the message
[2:12:55] don't read. So even if you give them a
[2:12:57] book in their own language, it doesn't
[2:12:59] do them any good. And when we go back to
[2:13:01] the first coming of Christ, who was it
[2:13:03] that heard him? It was the poor, it was
[2:13:05] the ignorant, it was the unlearned.
[2:13:07] That's who heard him then. And I think
[2:13:08] that's who's going to hear him again,
[2:13:10] right? And so I really think that making
[2:13:12] the message accessible in an audio
[2:13:15] format and then more books, I think, is
[2:13:18] just going to break another revival in
[2:13:20] those areas because, you know, the
[2:13:21] revival can be measured by the amount of
[2:13:23] the word that you have in your midst,
[2:13:24] right? And so, uh, that's one of the
[2:13:27] other things that we did as we traveled
[2:13:29] through with all the brethren and
[2:13:30] trained them how to do that and got them
[2:13:32] set up with all the equipment they
[2:13:34] needed to get, uh, to get doing the
[2:13:36] audio work as well. So, that's what we
[2:13:38] did with brother Freddy Gray in
[2:13:40] Haididerbad. Um, he lives in
[2:13:41] Haididerbad. He lives and works among
[2:13:43] the Telugu people. Um, he actually his
[2:13:46] father was from England and his mother
[2:13:47] was from India and he went to to school
[2:13:50] in South Carolina for a few years. uh
[2:13:52] fellowshipped with at that time brother
[2:13:54] Dan Dasley and uh then his father passed
[2:13:57] away and he moved back to India and took
[2:13:59] over the church there and uh so he's
[2:14:02] working with them to get the message
[2:14:03] into the into the Telugu language. We
[2:14:06] did the same with brother Isaac. We
[2:14:08] spent uh we basically spent all day at
[2:14:10] the print shop doing what doing the
[2:14:12] business that we had to do there and
[2:14:13] then every evening and weekend we were
[2:14:15] actually with brother Isaac's people uh
[2:14:17] training them how to how to use a print
[2:14:19] station how to get the audio tracks done
[2:14:22] how to get the me how to do the
[2:14:23] translating and and that's basically
[2:14:25] what our evenings were busy with and so
[2:14:27] brother Isaac's church got busy again
[2:14:30] I've only been out of India for a couple
[2:14:31] of weeks and they sent me the first
[2:14:33] message that was translated by their
[2:14:34] young people um in the Tamil language
[2:14:37] and they thought this would be a good
[2:14:38] one to start with. It's called Faith.
[2:14:40] And so that was their that was their
[2:14:42] first one they did. It's now translated,
[2:14:44] formatted, and ready and ready for the
[2:14:45] hub that we've got a little bit of
[2:14:47] adjustment to do on the format. And then
[2:14:49] it's ready to go. And that's their
[2:14:50] that's their to start the ball rolling.
[2:14:53] Brother Isaac really got really really
[2:14:56] caught the vision of of the power of the
[2:14:58] message hub and getting the message to
[2:15:00] the people. And so he uh he he speaks
[2:15:04] most of the conventions in the Tamil in
[2:15:07] the Tamil area. He's actually speaking
[2:15:08] he's I think since I've been there has
[2:15:10] spoke two or three different
[2:15:11] conventions. And he's just basically
[2:15:14] continually just passed that same burden
[2:15:15] on telling people if you've got people
[2:15:17] in your church that speak English and
[2:15:19] speak Tamil, you need to be translating.
[2:15:21] And so he's engaged a whole number of
[2:15:23] churches. So all all we really need to
[2:15:25] do with him is to continue to support
[2:15:28] him. Get them consumables for their
[2:15:30] printer. They're going to supply the
[2:15:31] paper. They're not asking for financial
[2:15:33] help for translation. And brother uh
[2:15:36] brother Isaac said, "If we need
[2:15:37] financial help for translation, we'll do
[2:15:39] it ourselves. That's what we need to
[2:15:40] do." And so it was really a time of of
[2:15:44] passing, you know, and I heard it was
[2:15:45] preached while I was away of passing the
[2:15:47] baton.
[2:15:49] And so I was sitting in the service
[2:15:51] Sunday morning at brother Isaac's.
[2:15:53] Brother Isaac preached and uh you know
[2:15:55] as as typical kind of a thing you know
[2:15:59] different people have streamed here you
[2:16:00] know it was the same when I was when I
[2:16:01] was in Europe and people walk up to you
[2:16:03] say oh it's so nice to meet you in the
[2:16:05] flesh we've met you so many times on the
[2:16:07] internet and they feel like they know
[2:16:08] you cuz they've heard you and they kind
[2:16:11] of heard you say and they know a little
[2:16:12] about who you are and and of course you
[2:16:14] don't know them at all right and so
[2:16:17] and and so uh
[2:16:20] now I just derailed my derailed I
[2:16:22] thought they were uh where was I?
[2:16:28] &gt;&gt; Passing the baton. Thank you. So, man,
[2:16:31] it used to be just Brother Harold did
[2:16:32] that as as he got older and now I'm
[2:16:34] doing it.
[2:16:36] I remember brother Harold always doing
[2:16:37] that when he was preaching. Um so, in
[2:16:39] the passing in the passing of the baton,
[2:16:43] you know, I did a little demonstration
[2:16:44] with him because as I was sitting, oh, I
[2:16:46] started to say, you know, you're sitting
[2:16:47] in service and they know you. So, you of
[2:16:48] course they've seen that I lead songs
[2:16:50] here. So I'm just happily standing in
[2:16:52] service, you know, and just enjoying the
[2:16:53] the worship and the atmosphere. And they
[2:16:55] go to sing an English song and a runner
[2:16:57] comes down and hands me a cordless mic.
[2:16:59] I'm leading that one. And he hands you a
[2:17:01] cordless mic and you get to you get to
[2:17:02] lead that song. And of course the you
[2:17:04] know in India the timing is a little bit
[2:17:05] different and the tunes a little bit
[2:17:07] different. You know, it's a different
[2:17:08] style of music. They have notes we don't
[2:17:10] have, right? And so so anytime they sang
[2:17:13] anything in English, they handed me a
[2:17:15] microphone and I was now the song
[2:17:16] leader, right? So, uh, you know, I sang
[2:17:19] a song with him in in the morning and
[2:17:21] gave a little testimony. And so, it was,
[2:17:23] uh, afterwards though, I really, I was
[2:17:25] really impressed by the Holy Spirit that
[2:17:28] something supernatural had happened
[2:17:30] while I was there. And that was, you
[2:17:32] know, we did the printing, we did the
[2:17:36] translating, we funded all that. And I I
[2:17:38] don't mean me. I don't mean you, I mean
[2:17:40] Bible believers. And the the body of
[2:17:41] believers from around the world did
[2:17:43] that. And I really felt that what was
[2:17:45] happening was we were passing that baton
[2:17:47] into their hand. And so afterwards,
[2:17:50] brother Isaac asked me to meet because I
[2:17:53] talked to them, you know, and I asked
[2:17:54] the question I ask everywhere, you know,
[2:17:56] how many people speak English and Tamil
[2:17:58] and you know, 30 hands go up and I say,
[2:18:00] "Brother Isaac, there's 30 translators
[2:18:02] here. Then why aren't they working?"
[2:18:03] Right? And so afterwards, um, you know,
[2:18:07] Brother Isaac asked how many people
[2:18:08] could type in Tamil. And so we basically
[2:18:11] assembled a whole crew of volunteers
[2:18:13] like we've done with the with the young
[2:18:14] people here and after the service he
[2:18:17] gathered about 50 or 60 people together
[2:18:19] and uh asked me to talk to them about
[2:18:21] translating and typing and being
[2:18:23] involved. And so it just really struck
[2:18:26] me the concept of the baton being tossed
[2:18:28] because you know we being being handed
[2:18:31] because we were now really stopping the
[2:18:35] method that you know we're not shutting
[2:18:36] down the operation in India and people
[2:18:38] have said to me well I guess you know
[2:18:40] we're not doing anything in India
[2:18:41] anymore. Well let me tell you we have
[2:18:42] much more work to do in India today than
[2:18:44] we did two years ago
[2:18:46] &gt;&gt; because for the last several years you
[2:18:48] know basically we sent them a check and
[2:18:51] they printed books. That's what we did.
[2:18:53] Well, now we've said we have a better
[2:18:55] idea and now what we need to do is find
[2:18:57] 13 more brother Isaac's throughout India
[2:19:00] and train them and get them print
[2:19:01] stations and work with them and
[2:19:02] encourage them. So we've actually taken
[2:19:04] onto ourselves a whole lot more work
[2:19:06] than what we've had in India. So I want
[2:19:08] to let you to understand that like we're
[2:19:10] not we're not stopping what we're doing
[2:19:11] in India. And so as I was talking about
[2:19:15] handing off the baton, I did a little
[2:19:17] example and maybe brother David you
[2:19:18] could come up here if you don't mind. I
[2:19:19] want to do this. Um, I was kind of
[2:19:21] debating whether I would do this. But
[2:19:23] basically what I said, I need you to
[2:19:25] move a little quicker cuz you're going
[2:19:26] to take a baton. We're in a relay race.
[2:19:28] So turn around now. You have to be fast
[2:19:30] moving in a relay race. So I told the
[2:19:33] brothers, I said, now you know it came
[2:19:35] all the way down through Luther handed
[2:19:36] the baton to Wesley and all the way down
[2:19:38] and down and down and and then down to
[2:19:40] brother Brandham. Did it stop there? The
[2:19:43] baton was passed to the bride. And then
[2:19:45] in India, you know, with brother
[2:19:47] Biscll's burden and Dr. Jacobs, there
[2:19:49] was a burden to print and so we really
[2:19:52] took responsibility for it and I
[2:19:54] explained to them what we're doing is
[2:19:56] handing it off to you now. And in a re
[2:19:58] Have you ever run a relay race?
[2:20:00] &gt;&gt; Okay. So you know that when you're
[2:20:01] running a relay race, if the goal's over
[2:20:03] there, you're never going to look at me,
[2:20:04] right? Cuz you never look back in a
[2:20:06] relay race. So you're going to look that
[2:20:08] way, right? You're going to look that
[2:20:11] way. And and I'm going to come up and
[2:20:13] I'm going to give him the baton. And as
[2:20:14] I told him, I don't want you looking
[2:20:16] back to Chennai, the printing operation,
[2:20:18] the William Brennham Good News Society.
[2:20:20] We're passing the baton to you, and now
[2:20:22] you're responsible to get this message,
[2:20:24] and you're going to feel this thing come
[2:20:26] into your hand. Now, we know that the
[2:20:28] fastest runner is saved to the last.
[2:20:31] &gt;&gt; Your best runner is your last runner,
[2:20:33] right?
[2:20:34] &gt;&gt; And so, I told the brothers, I said,
[2:20:35] "Okay, now don't look back." You see,
[2:20:37] you're wanting to look back, aren't you?
[2:20:40] We have that thing. We always want to
[2:20:42] look back to that other age. We feel
[2:20:44] comfortable back there. I don't want you
[2:20:45] looking back. You're going to hear me
[2:20:46] breathing and coming up behind you and
[2:20:48] you're going to feel this thing in your
[2:20:49] hand. And now you're going to run with
[2:20:50] it. You have to run.
[2:20:52] &gt;&gt; You're going to run with it.
[2:20:55] Now, let me ask you this. I don't have a
[2:20:57] baton in my hand. Am I sad?
[2:21:01] &gt;&gt; I'm not sad.
[2:21:03] &gt;&gt; He's younger than me.
[2:21:05] &gt;&gt; He can run faster than me.
[2:21:07] &gt;&gt; And I'm going to cheer him on because
[2:21:09] when he reaches the goal, I reach the
[2:21:12] goal.
[2:21:19] And so that's ostensibly what we did
[2:21:21] with the brothers with with at at at
[2:21:23] brother Isaac's and and they really
[2:21:26] caught it. They really caught it to say,
[2:21:28] "Okay, we're responsible
[2:21:31] &gt;&gt; and you trust us and God trusts us. God
[2:21:33] trusts us that we're the we're the
[2:21:35] fastest runner. He put us at the end."
[2:21:37] &gt;&gt; And they were they were so inspired by
[2:21:39] that. And it was it was just wonderful
[2:21:41] to see God do that transference like
[2:21:43] that. It was it was it was it was a
[2:21:45] wonderful thing to see. And so what we
[2:21:47] want to do is encourage them. You know,
[2:21:50] when David's running, I'm going to say,
[2:21:51] "Run, run, run. You can do it. Run." And
[2:21:55] that's what we want to continue doing
[2:21:57] with the brothers in India is to stand
[2:21:58] back and say, "Keep running. You need
[2:22:00] you need toner, here's toner. You need
[2:22:02] another printer, here's a printer. You
[2:22:04] need you need help with a computer,
[2:22:05] we'll teach you how to do that." And
[2:22:07] basically that old old saying of you
[2:22:09] know give them a fish or teach them how
[2:22:10] to fish. We want to teach them how to
[2:22:12] fish and give it to them and think about
[2:22:15] how they felt when they were able to
[2:22:17] send me this first message.
[2:22:19] &gt;&gt; I got a wonderful email along with this
[2:22:21] message. They were so thrilled to send
[2:22:23] this to me because I told them I said I
[2:22:25] want to put a little pressure on them.
[2:22:26] I'm I'm like that you know. I want to
[2:22:28] put a little pressure on them. I said in
[2:22:29] a few weeks I'm going to be standing up
[2:22:31] giving a testimony of what happened in
[2:22:32] India and I want a message in my hand
[2:22:34] when I stand there. I don't want to be
[2:22:36] here empty-handed. I don't want to have
[2:22:37] a theory, and this is an academic way to
[2:22:39] translate books. I want a book in my
[2:22:41] hand.
[2:22:42] &gt;&gt; And so, you know, after a few days, they
[2:22:43] emailed me and said, "Well, well, we're
[2:22:45] not sure if we're going to make it." I
[2:22:46] said, "You have to."
[2:22:49] I was encouraging them and they sent the
[2:22:52] book. Amen. And so, we want to, you
[2:22:54] know, in all of these areas where we
[2:22:56] were, whether it was India, Indonesia,
[2:22:59] in Europe, all of these brethren need
[2:23:01] our prayers. You know, they're under
[2:23:03] tremendous pressure. They're under
[2:23:05] pressures to quit. You know, I'm going
[2:23:07] to show you a little clip, a little
[2:23:09] video clip from uh Brother Isaac's
[2:23:12] church. You know, they're all under
[2:23:14] pressure. You know, in Indonesia,
[2:23:16] they're under pressure from the Muslims
[2:23:17] to stop handing out books. In Israel, we
[2:23:20] found that among the people that, you
[2:23:22] know, we said, "You can print books and
[2:23:23] stand on the street corner and hand them
[2:23:24] out." I thought, "Oh, that's scary."
[2:23:27] Remember, you remember you remember,
[2:23:27] Brother Milo? because, you know, they
[2:23:30] they they moved there from Russia
[2:23:32] because they've got a little bit of
[2:23:33] Jewish or completely Jewish in their
[2:23:35] history, which gives them entrance into
[2:23:36] into into Israel. But in Israel, if
[2:23:40] you're found trying to convert people
[2:23:42] from Judaism to Christianity, you can be
[2:23:44] deported.
[2:23:46] And so that's the pressure those people
[2:23:47] are under. So they're trying to live
[2:23:49] just, you know, and they come from a
[2:23:50] communist background where, you know,
[2:23:52] the the the the paradigm is a little
[2:23:54] bit, you know, you kind of walk quietly
[2:23:55] and hope nobody notices you.
[2:23:57] And so that's kind of where they are. We
[2:23:59] we we you feel that among the Russian
[2:24:01] people. And so that's kind of where they
[2:24:03] are in Israel. They need our prayers.
[2:24:06] They need our support. And it's the same
[2:24:09] in Indonesia. It's the same in India.
[2:24:11] And so there's a lot of work to be done
[2:24:13] in India. You know, people I came home
[2:24:15] and people said to me, "Oh, so you're
[2:24:16] done in India now? India's done." I
[2:24:19] thought, "Brother, we just started." You
[2:24:20] know, we've got we've got we've got the
[2:24:22] the Tamil moving forward. We got the
[2:24:24] Telugu moving forward. We have 13 13
[2:24:27] languages. We have 11 more languages to
[2:24:29] keep moving forward. And there are 13
[2:24:32] languages in India that we've never
[2:24:34] translated a thing into. We're barely
[2:24:37] started in India. We're barely started
[2:24:39] throughout the world. And when we look
[2:24:40] at this effort that we have here of
[2:24:44] Uganda and Tanzania and Kenya and and
[2:24:46] Rwanda and everywhere in the world,
[2:24:49] there is no end of things to do. There's
[2:24:52] absolutely no end of things to do.
[2:24:54] Um, can I get the next slide?
[2:24:59] Oh, I don't know if we need that one in
[2:25:00] here. I should have taken that one out.
[2:25:01] But basically, it's the sample tools. We
[2:25:03] found we found a way to uh to fill
[2:25:06] toner. Um, if we buy toner from HP, they
[2:25:08] cost us about $225 and we get 600 books.
[2:25:12] Um, with the help of Brother Kelly from
[2:25:14] Mexico, we figured out how to refill
[2:25:15] these toners for about $6 or $7 and we
[2:25:18] still get 600 books out of them. So,
[2:25:19] we're just in the pennies per book to to
[2:25:22] be able to uh and so we everywhere we
[2:25:24] go, we train the brothers how to refill
[2:25:26] their own toner, and all we need to do
[2:25:28] is find a way to get the toner to them,
[2:25:29] and they become self-sufficient. The
[2:25:32] next one,
[2:25:34] um, so just some some quick stats on the
[2:25:36] on the on the message hub. You know,
[2:25:38] last year there was 39 languages. By the
[2:25:41] end of this year, we'll have 50. Um,
[2:25:43] audio titles. I'm not going to go
[2:25:44] through these numbers. if you could uh
[2:25:46] what we're going to do if you want to
[2:25:47] just put this off. I'm going to play a
[2:25:49] short clip for you, a short video clip,
[2:25:52] and I need to explain it to you before I
[2:25:54] do it because it's only a few minutes
[2:25:55] long and it'll be over and you won't
[2:25:57] know what it's all about. So, I'll just
[2:25:59] explain it to you a little bit. Brother
[2:26:01] Isaac's congregation is in Chennai and
[2:26:05] he has about 500 people. And in his
[2:26:09] church, uh they had a problem with all
[2:26:11] the neighbors complaining because they
[2:26:12] make too much noise. And let me tell
[2:26:15] you, if you compare our congregation
[2:26:18] with their congregation, we might think
[2:26:19] they make too much noise cuz they are
[2:26:21] very enthusiastic in their worship,
[2:26:23] right? And so the neighbors complain,
[2:26:26] not during the preaching, but during the
[2:26:27] time of worship that they're too loud.
[2:26:29] So they basically they have a a a
[2:26:32] two-story building that's a church, and
[2:26:34] they raised it, right? They they they
[2:26:35] tore it right down to the first level,
[2:26:38] leaving the first floor on and have to
[2:26:40] completely rebuild the whole church with
[2:26:42] soundproof walls and everything. So that
[2:26:44] so that the neighbors won't complain and
[2:26:45] you know new windows and because a lot
[2:26:46] of the buildings in India you know you
[2:26:48] don't you don't need glass you don't
[2:26:49] because you know it's it's never cold
[2:26:51] there as you know it was 39° most days
[2:26:54] when I was there and when you're like me
[2:26:56] built like a polar bear you kind of melt
[2:26:57] in that climate but but uh so they're
[2:27:01] they're they're just currently
[2:27:03] rebuilding their church and and it was
[2:27:06] amazing to see them all engaged
[2:27:08] everybody in the in the congregation
[2:27:09] engaged and you know it's nothing but
[2:27:11] persecution Because right across the
[2:27:14] street is the Catholic church. And when
[2:27:17] I was there and I stayed at at in
[2:27:19] Brother Isaac's church, they have a
[2:27:20] little guest room where I stayed for a
[2:27:22] few days. And every night at the
[2:27:24] Catholic church, there was either a rock
[2:27:26] concert or a bingo
[2:27:29] 52 all night long.
[2:27:32] You know, it drove me crazy and I
[2:27:33] thought I'd much rather listen to Saints
[2:27:35] worship than listen to the bingo all
[2:27:37] night long, you know. And you know, it's
[2:27:38] a it's a huge building with a massive
[2:27:41] sound system. And so you realize it's
[2:27:43] nothing but religious persecution. So
[2:27:45] that in any case, the city said, "You'll
[2:27:47] either do it or or we'll shut you down."
[2:27:49] So they're in this project. All of the
[2:27:52] work is being done by the believers in
[2:27:54] the church.
[2:27:55] And when I say all of the work, I don't
[2:27:57] mean they have people operating cranes
[2:27:59] from the church. Um, if you've seen how
[2:28:02] buildings have been built in in in
[2:28:04] India, you know, the truck comes and
[2:28:05] dumps the dirt out on the front street
[2:28:07] and it has to be hauled up three stories
[2:28:09] or two stories and the bricks have to be
[2:28:10] hauled up. That's all being done by hand
[2:28:12] and it's all being done by the believers
[2:28:14] in the church. So, while they're doing
[2:28:16] that, they're in a they're in a church
[2:28:18] right now, pardon me, they're renting a
[2:28:20] school gymnasium where they're having
[2:28:21] services. I mean, I was amazed because
[2:28:23] when I was there last time in February,
[2:28:25] I mean, there was a church there. It'd
[2:28:27] be like walking into here and here's the
[2:28:28] church. And the next time I go, I mean,
[2:28:30] this thing was raised right to the floor
[2:28:32] level and they're just busy now
[2:28:33] rebuilding the walls and the roof. So,
[2:28:35] if we can just if we can just run that.
[2:28:36] This is Brother Isaac, the pastor of the
[2:28:38] church there in Chennai.
[2:28:43] &gt;&gt; You better turn that up.
[2:28:48] because
[2:28:52] we are making too much noise.
[2:28:54] The complaint is that our worship is
[2:28:58] &gt;&gt; that's why we are reworking our project
[2:29:02] &gt;&gt; so that we had a sound group so we can
[2:29:05] worship our Lord the way we want
[2:29:07] &gt;&gt; right and who's doing all this work
[2:29:09] &gt;&gt; who's doing all the work
[2:29:11] &gt;&gt; all the work is all these our believers
[2:29:13] &gt;&gt; right
[2:29:13] &gt;&gt; so you can see now our children's unders
[2:29:18] &gt;&gt; so there's the crane getting the sand up
[2:29:19] to the next level that's the Sunday
[2:29:21] school class
[2:29:22] &gt;&gt; youngsters are our believers
[2:29:25] is also working with this building.
[2:29:26] &gt;&gt; Mhm.
[2:29:28] &gt;&gt; While I was there, they moved three dump
[2:29:30] truck loads up to the next floor.
[2:29:37] &gt;&gt; And the sisters got to be part of the
[2:29:39] work as well, the ladies.
[2:29:43] [Music]
[2:29:46] That's
[2:29:46] &gt;&gt; hard work.
[2:29:48] It was 39° and I couldn't hardly imagine
[2:29:51] doing that kind of work in that weather.
[2:29:53] &gt;&gt; They wanted to work. Uhhuh.
[2:30:00] &gt;&gt; Most of them are
[2:30:02] &gt;&gt; right
[2:30:05] behind
[2:30:07] me.
[2:30:09] &gt;&gt; All the rest of them are believers.
[2:30:14] So, you may not be able to hear that,
[2:30:15] but he said they're all all believers
[2:30:17] doing the work except for the
[2:30:19] stonemason.
[2:30:23] [Applause]
[2:30:30] [Music]
[2:30:31] [Applause]
[2:30:35] Heat.
[2:30:39] [Applause]
[2:30:43] Heat.
[2:30:45] [Music]
[2:30:46] [Applause]
[2:31:13] [Applause]
[2:31:19] All the children sit right on the front
[2:31:20] on here on the floor. That's where all
[2:31:22] the children are sitting.
[2:31:25] [Applause]
[2:31:29] Sunday school teachers sit with the
[2:31:31] children.
[2:31:39] [Applause]
[2:31:55] Amen. So that's the church in India.
[2:31:58] &gt;&gt; So again, brother Isaac, you know,
[2:32:00] brother Isaac, I asked them, I said,
[2:32:02] "How you paying for this?" Oh, I don't
[2:32:05] know. You know, we just uh the Lord's
[2:32:07] going to work it out for us. You know,
[2:32:08] he didn't ask for anything, but you
[2:32:11] know, I think if you felt it on your
[2:32:12] heart to get behind that work, they need
[2:32:14] to put that second story up on their
[2:32:16] church. Um, I think it would be nice to
[2:32:18] give him an offering. He didn't ask for
[2:32:20] it and he'd be embarrassed to know that
[2:32:21] I even made it known to you that there's
[2:32:23] any kind of a need. So, we're uh
[2:32:28] overall we really felt that it was a
[2:32:30] very successful five weeks when we look
[2:32:32] at the impact that was had in Indonesia
[2:32:35] and in India, Israel, all the different
[2:32:38] places we were. And I think one of the
[2:32:40] biggest impacts that we had was the
[2:32:42] number of partnerships that were formed
[2:32:44] and the people that were encouraged to
[2:32:46] get involved in the work of the Lord. Uh
[2:32:48] we spent a fair amount of time with
[2:32:50] brother Gird Roalt. He was in the Moscow
[2:32:52] meetings and of course he's been engaged
[2:32:55] in missions work for a very very long
[2:32:57] time and after seeing what we were doing
[2:32:59] with the message hub in in Moscow and
[2:33:02] kind of seeing how it worked and how
[2:33:03] we're filling the needs in you know that
[2:33:05] in Chennai we'll still maintain a
[2:33:07] central office there that will have a
[2:33:09] print station that will send books out
[2:33:11] because we don't want to leave anybody
[2:33:13] behind you know some churches we'll send
[2:33:15] a print station there they can print
[2:33:16] their own books and they can print for
[2:33:18] other local churches in other cases they
[2:33:21] can't print themselves. They don't have
[2:33:22] power. They're in a they're in a rural
[2:33:24] area and they just can't do it. So,
[2:33:25] we'll still be sending books to some of
[2:33:27] those areas. So, when Brother Gird saw
[2:33:29] how that was how that was done, um he
[2:33:32] really got behind it himself and he
[2:33:34] said, "I'm going to send you 10
[2:33:35] addresses where I'd like you to send
[2:33:36] print stations and they're going to
[2:33:37] support that from Germany." Um, Brother
[2:33:40] Gird's Church continues to support the
[2:33:42] work in China. So, I just I I was I was
[2:33:45] really happy. I I'll just say it like
[2:33:47] this. When a minister says to you, I'm
[2:33:49] going to give you my contacts. Well,
[2:33:51] then you know that you're on the right
[2:33:52] side on the right side of them, right?
[2:33:55] And so the the partnerships that were
[2:33:58] formed, those are eternal,
[2:34:00] &gt;&gt; you know, and the bonds that were formed
[2:34:02] with the different brothers and whatnot
[2:34:03] around the world. And we just I I just
[2:34:06] want to encourage you, as I said
[2:34:08] tonight, you know, I'm a lay member. I'm
[2:34:09] not a minister. You know, God's given me
[2:34:12] certain gifts and talents in my life.
[2:34:14] You know, I I don't know if we could
[2:34:16] really quantify what they are. However,
[2:34:18] he's found a way. And you know, I was
[2:34:21] listening this morning when I was
[2:34:22] getting ready for a song service for
[2:34:24] song service. I was singing a song, you
[2:34:25] know, um Jesus, if I die upon a foreign
[2:34:29] field someday would be no more than love
[2:34:31] demands, no less could I replay. And he
[2:34:34] said, "If just a cup of water I place
[2:34:36] into your hand, then just a cup of water
[2:34:38] is all that I demand."
[2:34:39] You know, if God didn't give you the
[2:34:41] gift,
[2:34:42] &gt;&gt; right?
[2:34:42] &gt;&gt; He actually doesn't want it.
[2:34:45] &gt;&gt; You understand? If God didn't didn't
[2:34:47] give you the ability, he's looking to
[2:34:49] give you something that you give back to
[2:34:51] him in whatever form it is. You know, I
[2:34:53] look at those young boys. I mean, my
[2:34:55] goodness, it was 39°. I was standing
[2:34:57] there and I was exhausted running the
[2:35:00] video camera, you know, in that heat.
[2:35:02] And those boys were going up and down
[2:35:04] the ladder, up and down the ladder with
[2:35:05] buckets of sand. And you know, they're
[2:35:08] putting a balcony on the church. So,
[2:35:09] it's it's the equivalent of this is on
[2:35:11] the first floor and then a balcony
[2:35:12] above. And they were hauling the this
[2:35:15] gravel from the street out front where
[2:35:17] the truck dumped it bucketloads at a
[2:35:19] time all the way up to the top. All the
[2:35:20] way up to the top all day long. And uh
[2:35:22] you know, Brother Isaac said, "Yes, this
[2:35:24] is the Sunday school class. We're having
[2:35:25] an object lesson here." you know, so and
[2:35:29] so it's uh and a little bit, you know, a
[2:35:33] little bit, you know, that on the
[2:35:35] horizon there's this building that may
[2:35:36] appear outside and I wanted you to show
[2:35:39] the sacrifice that they're that they're
[2:35:40] making in India to have their building.
[2:35:42] And I think if we're going to have a
[2:35:43] school building, we're going to have to
[2:35:44] make the same sacrifice that, you know,
[2:35:46] we're just going to have to get behind
[2:35:47] it and and use what what God has given
[2:35:50] us to be able to do that.
[2:35:52] So, I'm thankful. I'm I'm I'm really
[2:35:54] thankful when when a person is traveling
[2:35:56] for your prayers. You know, we want to
[2:35:59] continue to remember brother Victor is
[2:36:00] on the field tonight. Brother Brother
[2:36:02] Timothy's on the field tonight. You
[2:36:04] know, when you're traveling sometimes
[2:36:06] out of bed for two and three days and
[2:36:09] and you know, you're you're involved
[2:36:11] with different things and different
[2:36:13] forces working against you and you're
[2:36:14] just going going. You don't always have
[2:36:16] the time to eat properly and to sleep
[2:36:18] properly and to actually to feed your
[2:36:21] spiritual life the way you should. And
[2:36:23] so, you know, when I came home and
[2:36:25] brother Tom preached about being weary
[2:36:27] and he said, "I don't know why I'm
[2:36:28] thinking about you, brother Kim." He
[2:36:30] might as well have just dismissed the
[2:36:31] rest of you
[2:36:33] because he was ringing my bell, right?
[2:36:36] and and and and so it is very worrisome
[2:36:39] and it's so it's it's so wonderful to
[2:36:41] know that there's a body of people
[2:36:42] behind you and and and you know what
[2:36:45] gave me such confidence was you know
[2:36:47] when I was doing things in India and you
[2:36:49] know I came to the place of realizing
[2:36:51] some hard decisions needed to be made
[2:36:53] and I felt those were outside of my
[2:36:55] scope so I phoned my pastor and I said
[2:36:57] pastor what should I do and so my pastor
[2:36:59] said do this and so now I I can relax
[2:37:02] I'm I've got a body of believers behind
[2:37:04] me I'm under the headship of my pastor
[2:37:06] and I'm just going ahead and and and
[2:37:08] carrying out the marching orders. And so
[2:37:10] it's wonderful. I I I want to thank you
[2:37:12] for your prayers, for your support. And
[2:37:15] uh I just really I it's almost
[2:37:19] impossible to try and find a way to to
[2:37:23] express um really what's in my heart as
[2:37:26] far as we can get behind these people in
[2:37:29] Indonesia and in India and in Israel.
[2:37:32] It's not that difficult for us to do. We
[2:37:34] might have to lay down having a quad. We
[2:37:37] might have to lay down, you know, having
[2:37:38] some recreational time and spend the
[2:37:41] evenings, you know, transcribing
[2:37:43] messages and doing these kind of things.
[2:37:45] But, you know, I told I told the people
[2:37:48] in Indonesia, I said, "Can you imagine
[2:37:49] when you get to the other side?" Because
[2:37:51] every message has a key in it. You know,
[2:37:53] you've all read a message at one point
[2:37:55] and you've read something in there and
[2:37:56] you found this little key and that
[2:37:58] little key unlocked something in your
[2:38:00] life and set you free from something
[2:38:01] that was troubling you. It it it it
[2:38:04] raised your faith up enough to receive
[2:38:05] healing.
[2:38:07] &gt;&gt; Could you imagine getting to the other
[2:38:08] side, Brother Timothy, and somebody
[2:38:10] walking up to you and say, "Brother
[2:38:12] Timothy, thank you for getting those
[2:38:13] messages on the hub. I read that and I
[2:38:16] got healed. I read that and I got
[2:38:18] saved."
[2:38:19] &gt;&gt; That's laying up for the eternal. Amen.
[2:38:23] &gt;&gt; So, we're going to ask brother Peter to
[2:38:26] come. We need a preacher. We can't have
[2:38:29] an evening without a preacher. Amen. So,
[2:38:31] come, brother Peter. and uh share with
[2:38:33] share with the congregation what the
[2:38:34] Lord's put on your heart. As he comes,
[2:38:36] let's change our position just for a
[2:38:38] minute. We're going to stand and do like
[2:38:39] we do in India. Sing a capella, Amazing
[2:38:41] Grace. Stretch a little, refresh
[2:38:44] yourself, and let's get ready to hear
[2:38:46] the word this evening. Amen.
[2:38:49] Amazing
[2:38:52] grace,
[2:38:55] how sweet
[2:38:57] the sound.
[2:39:01] I see
[2:39:04] a rich
[2:39:06] like me.
[2:39:09] [Applause]
[2:39:12] I once
[2:39:15] was lost
[2:39:17] but now
[2:39:21] I found.
[2:39:24] I was blind,
[2:39:26] but now
[2:39:30] I see.
[2:39:35] And we
[2:39:39] [Music]
[2:39:40] 10,000
[2:39:44] years
[2:39:46] bright shine
[2:39:48] [Applause]
[2:39:50] as
[2:39:52] the sun.
[2:39:57] We go
[2:40:00] [Applause]
[2:40:01] [Music]
[2:40:03] to sing
[2:40:06] God's praise.
[2:40:09] And when
[2:40:12] we first
[2:40:14] [Applause]
[2:40:16] [Music]
[2:40:21] praise God,
[2:40:24] praise God.
[2:40:27] Praise God.
[2:40:30] Praise God.
[2:40:33] Praise God.
[2:40:36] Praise God.
[2:40:40] Praise God.
[2:40:45] Praise God.
[2:40:48] Praise God.
[2:40:51] Praise God.
[2:40:55] Praise God.
[2:40:58] Praise God.
[2:41:01] Praise God.
[2:41:08] &gt;&gt; I just want to say a word. Brother Peter
[2:41:11] has journeyied uh with me or I've
[2:41:14] journeyed with him to Ukraine to
[2:41:18] Usbekiststan
[2:41:20] and there he did all the interpreting.
[2:41:23] uh and I can say is a real uh real
[2:41:27] servant of Christ. And so I was going to
[2:41:30] cap off the service, but I just said no
[2:41:32] on brother Peter just to take what's on
[2:41:35] his heart and immediately after and
[2:41:37] Sister Tina uh Dickinson's going to be
[2:41:40] baptized.
[2:41:40] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:41:41] &gt;&gt; God bless you, brother Peter.
[2:41:42] &gt;&gt; Praise God.
[2:41:44] &gt;&gt; Well, Amen.
[2:41:46] Praise God. Uh well, I just would like
[2:41:48] to make one correction. I I'm not a
[2:41:50] preacher. I just
[2:41:53] I would like to just share some things
[2:41:54] that God has uh made real to me. Um
[2:41:58] because
[2:41:59] like I've said before,
[2:42:02] anyone that listens to the message,
[2:42:03] anyone that feeds upon the word, um when
[2:42:05] you hear the message, there's always
[2:42:07] something that jumps out at you. There's
[2:42:08] always something that becomes real to
[2:42:10] you. And there's some things, you know,
[2:42:12] that you might hear and some person may
[2:42:15] listen to it and to him it would be just
[2:42:17] an uncertain sound. But to another
[2:42:19] person, you may hear the same exact
[2:42:21] message, but you will hear something.
[2:42:22] You receive something because there's an
[2:42:24] answer. There's a key.
[2:42:26] &gt;&gt; And so, I'd like to just share some
[2:42:28] things. Uh, if you'd like to open
[2:42:31] in the book of John,
[2:42:33] Gospel of John,
[2:42:38] we're going to just read the first uh
[2:42:40] 10, chapter 10, verse 1
[2:42:46] through 3.
[2:42:48] Verily, verily, I say unto you, he that
[2:42:51] enterth not by the door into the
[2:42:53] sheepfold, but climbth up some other
[2:42:56] way, the same is the thief and a robber.
[2:42:59] But he that enterth in by the door is
[2:43:02] the shepherd of the sheep. To him the
[2:43:04] porter openeth, and the sheep hear the
[2:43:06] his voice, and he calleth his own sheep
[2:43:09] by name, and leadth them out. May God
[2:43:12] bless the reading of his word.
[2:43:16] You could sit down. I'm sorry.
[2:43:22] Well, brother Ed had asked me to speak a
[2:43:25] little bit about Moscow trip and uh the
[2:43:28] things that that that are happening
[2:43:30] there. Just to to maybe sum it up and
[2:43:34] say it in a few words. Uh like I said
[2:43:37] before, it's amazing to see people in
[2:43:40] the on totally other side of the world,
[2:43:43] but they have the same spirit. They have
[2:43:45] the same the same zeal. They have the
[2:43:47] same uh desires only because they're
[2:43:50] feeding upon the same word because
[2:43:52] they're feeding upon the same message.
[2:43:54] And uh I was uh I was there in the
[2:43:57] minister's meetings and brother Sergey
[2:43:59] the pastor he said this uh thought
[2:44:02] uh they were discussing some issues and
[2:44:04] he said that
[2:44:06] they were going through some troubles in
[2:44:08] their church and they were going through
[2:44:09] some turmoil and they couldn't they
[2:44:11] couldn't just connect because they they
[2:44:13] they've come together from different
[2:44:15] backgrounds and different u different
[2:44:18] understandings of the message or of the
[2:44:20] scripture. And like brother Tom spoke
[2:44:22] this morning, we all have opinions. And
[2:44:25] uh but he said that God laid something
[2:44:28] upon his heart. And what they did is
[2:44:29] they started while they were building
[2:44:31] the church, they started just to listen
[2:44:33] to the messages. They started listening
[2:44:34] from I think it said 1962 and just from
[2:44:37] that year and they started uh going in
[2:44:39] the numerical order as as brother
[2:44:41] Brandon preached the preached the
[2:44:42] messages and he said just the preaching
[2:44:45] of the word he said has changed people's
[2:44:47] lives so much that it actually set the
[2:44:49] church in order. He said people realize
[2:44:52] who they are what they what position
[2:44:53] they have to take and what they have to
[2:44:55] do in their in their in their situation
[2:44:57] and in their uh in the things that
[2:44:59] they're doing in their daily life. And
[2:45:01] he said
[2:45:03] to to everyone that was there and it was
[2:45:06] mainly ministers, he said, "I could
[2:45:07] truly say that this message is Jesus
[2:45:10] Christ."
[2:45:10] &gt;&gt; And so if we if we approach the message
[2:45:12] that we have today the same way as that
[2:45:15] it's not a book. It's not just a a
[2:45:18] format. It's not just something that we
[2:45:19] have on the page, but it's Jesus Christ
[2:45:22] in written form. Then we would receive
[2:45:24] something from it. we'll get something
[2:45:26] from it and we'll realize something that
[2:45:28] maybe the uh the other gen the other
[2:45:31] people that we're that we're living with
[2:45:33] where we're rubbing shoulders with the
[2:45:34] world they don't see it because they
[2:45:37] don't have the message but if you have
[2:45:38] the message you have the person Jesus
[2:45:41] Christ and the reason why I chose the
[2:45:43] scripture here is that it says here that
[2:45:46] the porter openeth and the sheep hear
[2:45:48] the his voice and he calleth his own his
[2:45:50] own sheep by name and leadth them out.
[2:45:53] You know the porter is there was there's
[2:45:55] been seven porters seven seven people
[2:45:58] who've been basically stand at the door
[2:46:00] seven church age messengers and we had a
[2:46:03] messenger that has come in this last
[2:46:04] generation to bring the word to open the
[2:46:07] door for us so that the sheep could hear
[2:46:09] his voice so that the sheep could feed
[2:46:11] upon upon the word which is Jesus Christ
[2:46:13] which is God. And like I've I've spoke
[2:46:15] on this before and I I don't want to I
[2:46:18] don't want to be just repeating what
[2:46:19] I've said before, but it's something
[2:46:21] that has opened and become real to me
[2:46:22] and I I just can't get it off my mind,
[2:46:24] off my off my off my heart that in Luke
[2:46:28] 24:45
[2:46:30] when uh when when when Jesus Christ rose
[2:46:33] from the dead and he was walking with
[2:46:35] those uh with those who were uh on the
[2:46:37] road to Emmas and when he when he came
[2:46:39] back to them and there was there was 11
[2:46:41] of them gathered and that Jesus Christ
[2:46:43] said,
[2:46:44] I'm just going to read that verse 44 and
[2:46:47] 45. And he said unto them, "These are
[2:46:50] the words which I spake unto you while I
[2:46:53] was yet with you, that all things must
[2:46:55] be fulfilled which were written in the
[2:46:57] law of Moses and in the prophecies and
[2:47:00] in Psalms concerning me." Then he opened
[2:47:03] their understanding that they might
[2:47:05] understand the scriptures. And the thing
[2:47:08] is I always wondered how did God open
[2:47:10] how did Jesus Christ open their
[2:47:11] understanding? How did he open their
[2:47:13] mind? And if we read if we look at the
[2:47:15] at the at the key verse verse 44, he was
[2:47:18] pointing to the to the things that have
[2:47:20] been fulfilled in their generation in
[2:47:22] their day maybe few days before or even
[2:47:25] starting from his birth. He was pointing
[2:47:27] back and telling them look this
[2:47:29] scripture has just been fulfilled in in
[2:47:31] your in your day. He this scripture
[2:47:34] Isaiah 6 was just fulfilled beginning
[2:47:37] when I was born. This scripture was
[2:47:39] Psalm 21 was fulfilled three days ago.
[2:47:42] This scripture was fulfilled this day.
[2:47:44] And so he was pointing to them and
[2:47:45] showing them that this scripture has
[2:47:47] become alive. And brother Bram says
[2:47:49] modern events made clear by prophecy.
[2:47:51] It's not the it's not the prophecy made
[2:47:53] clear by the events, but it's but the
[2:47:55] but the but the events are made clear by
[2:47:58] the prophecy. So when when we have the
[2:48:01] word that that has come to us and I
[2:48:04] spoke to my relatives uh and we had a
[2:48:07] little get together with my cousins and
[2:48:08] relatives and a lot of them are
[2:48:10] Pentecostal and we actually rented a
[2:48:13] build rent rented a cabin at the Bible
[2:48:16] camp and so we decided to have a little
[2:48:18] church gathering on the on the on the on
[2:48:20] the large deck there and I had a chance
[2:48:22] and opportunity to speak to them and
[2:48:25] Lord Lord really kind of gave me the
[2:48:28] inspiration and courage to speak to them
[2:48:30] because they really they they they think
[2:48:32] that we're just following a man. They
[2:48:34] think that we're just following
[2:48:35] something some man or some doctrine. And
[2:48:38] I the first thing first question I asked
[2:48:39] them is, "Do you know where you are
[2:48:41] positionally today in the scripture?"
[2:48:43] &gt;&gt; And they they're sitting there and
[2:48:45] they're looking at me and I could see
[2:48:47] that they don't have a clue. They have
[2:48:48] no no understanding of what I'm talking
[2:48:50] about. But the thing is Jesus Christ
[2:48:53] when he came and he fulfilled the
[2:48:54] scripture that was written of him. When
[2:48:56] he came in flesh all that was that was
[2:48:58] the fulfillment of the prophecies that
[2:49:00] was written in that day. So today when
[2:49:02] we have when we're living in our day we
[2:49:05] are just living out a certain part of
[2:49:07] the scripture in our day in our
[2:49:08] generation. So when Jesus Christ came
[2:49:12] and he's he was he was telling the
[2:49:13] disciples that this scripture you know
[2:49:16] beginning from Moses him and Psalms he
[2:49:18] he was showing them the scriptures that
[2:49:20] were fulfilled within maybe the last 30
[2:49:22] years or the majority of the scriptures
[2:49:24] were fulfilled in the last few hours of
[2:49:25] his life and he was telling them look
[2:49:27] back this was just fulfilled yesterday
[2:49:29] this was fulfilled 3 days ago and so the
[2:49:31] people this this way he opened their
[2:49:33] understanding where they could see that
[2:49:35] this is what God has done and they
[2:49:37] realize that who we are and where we are
[2:49:39] positionally in the scripture. And
[2:49:41] because of that, I believe that apostle
[2:49:43] Peter and the 11 that rose up with him
[2:49:45] on the day of Pentecost, he could say,
[2:49:47] "This is that which is written by the
[2:49:49] prophet Joel that I shall send my spirit
[2:49:53] upon all flesh." And he started saying
[2:49:55] all these things only because he
[2:49:57] realized who he was. He realized where
[2:49:59] he is in the economy of God. He realized
[2:50:02] where he is in the scripture today. And
[2:50:04] so today when we are living and we have
[2:50:06] such word that we as we have the message
[2:50:08] that we have today if we look at it not
[2:50:11] only as a book or as a as something on
[2:50:14] the page but if we look at it as a
[2:50:15] person Jesus Christ and like it's like I
[2:50:18] said to my friends and relatives I said
[2:50:20] I've never seen a man that could take a
[2:50:22] scripture and that could say this day
[2:50:25] this scripture is fulfilled. To me that
[2:50:27] message is not just just not it's not
[2:50:29] just a message to me it's a
[2:50:31] proclamation. To me, it is something
[2:50:32] that comes comes to life. And I asked
[2:50:35] him, I said, "Could that man just be out
[2:50:37] of his mind that he doesn't know what
[2:50:38] he's talking about, or he's really led
[2:50:40] by the spirit of God to where he he has
[2:50:42] the courage and uh he has the strength
[2:50:45] to say that this scripture, Malachi 4,
[2:50:47] he's he could say that this scripture,
[2:50:49] Luke 17:30, he could say that this
[2:50:51] scripture, Revelation 10:7, he could say
[2:50:53] that this scripture is fulfilled." And
[2:50:55] because of that I said I believe that
[2:50:57] this man he came and he proved that
[2:50:59] Jesus Christ is the same yesterday,
[2:51:01] today and forever. And so today you and
[2:51:04] I we could say that based upon that that
[2:51:07] Jesus Christ was made real in in our
[2:51:09] generation we could say that this day
[2:51:11] the scripture is fulfilled and we are
[2:51:13] basing looking at that upon that upon
[2:51:15] the basis of this of what he has proved
[2:51:18] what he has shown to us it opens our
[2:51:20] eyes and we could say that we are living
[2:51:22] in the time of Revelation 10:8. We are
[2:51:25] living in the time of uh of the of the
[2:51:27] rapture of of Thessalonians 4:16. We can
[2:51:30] say that this is us. This is that which
[2:51:32] was written of us. We are part of that
[2:51:34] scripture. We are part of that word. And
[2:51:37] so just like uh brother Brandham, he
[2:51:40] said that this day this scripture is
[2:51:41] fulfilled. And when Jesus Christ was
[2:51:43] there, he said this day he t was talking
[2:51:46] about Moses. This day this scripture of
[2:51:48] Moses of Psalms of all these things that
[2:51:50] was written of me, they're fulfilled.
[2:51:52] And because of that their mind was open
[2:51:54] and they could see themselves in the
[2:51:56] scripture. Today we could see ourselves
[2:51:57] in the scripture where where we are in
[2:52:00] the program of God where we are in the
[2:52:02] in the in the program that God has in
[2:52:04] the time that God has ordained for us to
[2:52:06] live. And so because of that we could
[2:52:08] say we can we could come to a
[2:52:10] realization that we are in the word of
[2:52:12] God. Our we have a part that we have we
[2:52:15] have to fulfill. We have a part that God
[2:52:17] is bringing out, living out the prophecy
[2:52:20] through our lives, through our everyday
[2:52:22] walk with him, through our everyday just
[2:52:25] work, everything that we do. And
[2:52:26] brother, brother Ed when we were in
[2:52:28] Moscow, he said this phrase after they
[2:52:31] uh dedicated on Sunday, they the
[2:52:33] dedicational prayer and the service. And
[2:52:35] brother Ed said this that even though
[2:52:38] even if the rapture is going to be today
[2:52:40] or tomorrow the all this work that
[2:52:42] you've spent all this effort and time
[2:52:44] that you've spent it would not be in
[2:52:46] vain because it was built it was done
[2:52:48] for with the right objective with the
[2:52:49] right motive with the right goal for the
[2:52:51] glory of God. So whatever we are doing
[2:52:54] we are we're fulfilling part of the
[2:52:56] scripture. We're fulfilling our part
[2:52:58] that is written of us because we have a
[2:53:01] prophecy that needs to be fulfilled
[2:53:02] through our lives because we are the
[2:53:04] bride. If we believe the word, if we
[2:53:06] believe the message that God has sent,
[2:53:09] then we are the bride and we have that
[2:53:11] part where we could say this is that
[2:53:13] which was written of us in Thessalonians
[2:53:15] 4:16. This is that which is written of
[2:53:18] us. Revelation 10:8-11 and different
[2:53:20] scriptures, we could say that this is
[2:53:21] us. Just like apostle Peter could say
[2:53:24] this is that which was written in book
[2:53:26] of Joel. So may God bless you and um I
[2:53:29] just wanted to share that and may God
[2:53:32] may God bless you and just make this
[2:53:34] make this message more real to you and
[2:53:36] may this all of we heard and all of the
[2:53:38] that we've seen today that God is moving
[2:53:42] and God is not he's not done with his
[2:53:44] bride and she has a part to play. And I
[2:53:46] was speaking to a pastor in in Moscow in
[2:53:50] Moscow. He's from Barus and he was
[2:53:51] saying that he was telling me that I was
[2:53:53] translating for him and he was sharing
[2:53:55] he's saying that when he goes into
[2:53:56] little villages in Russia and he goes in
[2:53:59] there and there there could be a Baptist
[2:54:00] or a Pentecostal church. He goes in
[2:54:02] there he starts preaching. He shares
[2:54:03] them shares the message with them and
[2:54:06] they the people just get ignited. They
[2:54:07] start they just start they just fall in
[2:54:10] love with it and they they start asking
[2:54:12] for messages and and things like that
[2:54:14] and they you could see that there's
[2:54:15] they're ignited. They're just they're
[2:54:17] they're just asking where are you
[2:54:18] getting this? Where did this come from?
[2:54:20] How come we've never seen this? And then
[2:54:22] they uh a pastor or someone would call
[2:54:24] the the city and then the city would
[2:54:26] call the state and they would end up
[2:54:27] going to they would call to us and you
[2:54:30] know the archbishop or someone would say
[2:54:32] you have to go and investigate and then
[2:54:34] the people start realizing that they're
[2:54:36] under some control. They're under some
[2:54:37] headship and but they want to get out of
[2:54:39] that. They're saying he's saying they're
[2:54:40] realizing that they're in slavery.
[2:54:42] They're in bondage and so they're trying
[2:54:43] to get out of it. It makes them realize
[2:54:45] that we actually under bondage and it
[2:54:48] makes them get out, makes them want to
[2:54:49] get out even faster out of that
[2:54:51] organization, that system. And so they
[2:54:53] see that. And so I was telling the
[2:54:55] brother that by seeing what he was
[2:54:57] telling me, I realized that work in
[2:54:59] Russia and other parts of the world is
[2:55:01] not done, not over. And so God is moving
[2:55:04] and his his word is true. And we we all
[2:55:06] have a part to play. May God bless you.
[2:55:09] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:55:11] [Music]
[2:55:18] Well, I hope you enjoyed the evening.
[2:55:20] &gt;&gt; We took uh we took enough time because
[2:55:22] we didn't want to uh we didn't want to
[2:55:26] no put a put the clamps on any of the
[2:55:29] brothers. Just let them say what's on
[2:55:31] their heart. Uh we're going to have a
[2:55:34] baptism now. And uh I wonder if we could
[2:55:36] just have someone to the piano. Uh,
[2:55:41] good. That's saying I'm part of the
[2:55:44] family of God. I'm so glad I'm a part of
[2:55:46] the family of God. You take a microphone
[2:55:48] there.
[2:55:52] Amen. Why don't we stand once more and
[2:55:54] just change our position where we're
[2:55:56] glad for Citrina
[2:55:58] &gt;&gt; baptized.
[2:56:00] Pray
[2:56:02] that the Holy Spirit Amen.
[2:56:04] &gt;&gt; come upon we don't want people just go
[2:56:06] in dry and come all wet.
[2:56:08] says, "Repent
[2:56:11] and be baptized, every one of you, in
[2:56:14] the name of Jesus Christ, and you shall
[2:56:17] be filled with the Holy Ghost." You
[2:56:19] shall receive the gift of the Holy
[2:56:21] Ghost. We want them to receive that.
[2:56:24] That makes all the difference. All
[2:56:25] right, let's just sing it together.
[2:56:29] I'm so glad
[2:56:31] I'm a part
[2:56:34] of the family
[2:56:36] of God.
[2:56:38] I am walk
[2:56:41] in the fountain
[2:56:43] and
[2:56:46] his love
[2:56:48] joy
[2:56:50] with Jesus
[2:56:52] as we travel

[3:01:27] talking about the Lord. Oh, let's go on.
[3:01:32] Let's go on talking about this.
[3:01:37] Let's go on. Let's go on.
[3:01:42] Oh, yes. The de
[3:01:47] talking about this way.
[3:01:51] We don't like it.
[3:01:54] So, what are we going to do? Let's go.
[3:01:58] Let's go.
[3:02:00] talking about this way. Let's go on.
[3:02:05] Let's go on talking about feeling so
[3:02:09] much feeling so much better.
[3:02:13] Talking about this
[3:02:16] feeling so much better.
[3:02:19] talking about the Lord. So, let's go on.
[3:02:24] Let's go on talking about this little
[3:02:28] way. Let's go on. Let's go on talking
[3:02:33] about the Lord.
[3:02:36] Hallelujah. You can have your seats.
[3:02:43] Praise the Lord.
[3:02:46] &gt;&gt; Well,
[3:02:48] let's see.
[3:02:49] We heard about India,
[3:02:52] &gt;&gt; Switzerland,
[3:02:54] &gt;&gt; Indonesia,
[3:02:55] &gt;&gt; Russia,
[3:02:57] &gt;&gt; Russia,
[3:02:59] &gt;&gt; Israel,
[3:03:00] &gt;&gt; Israel.
[3:03:02] &gt;&gt; Now we're missionaring.
[3:03:04] &gt;&gt; All right. All right.
[3:03:05] &gt;&gt; In Cloverdale.
[3:03:07] &gt;&gt; All right.
[3:03:08] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[3:03:08] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[3:03:10] &gt;&gt; I mean, this is this is as more
[3:03:13] important than if if you want to put it
[3:03:14] this way. Brother Bram said, "First, you
[3:03:16] must missionary in your own backyard
[3:03:19] &gt;&gt; before you can go overseas."
[3:03:21] &gt;&gt; And because we're doing this in our own
[3:03:23] backyard, God sends the men of God
[3:03:25] &gt;&gt; overseas.
[3:03:27] &gt;&gt; And I think it's a wonderful thing,
[3:03:28] Sister Tina.
[3:03:29] &gt;&gt; Yes,
[3:03:30] &gt;&gt; we're going to take our time.
[3:03:31] &gt;&gt; It's not 3,000 being baptized tonight.
[3:03:36] &gt;&gt; But it is the book of Acts being
[3:03:38] baptized tonight.
[3:03:39] &gt;&gt; Amen. And it was just as real to them as
[3:03:43] it is for me as it is for Sister Tina
[3:03:45] Dickinson to be in the waters of
[3:03:47] baptism. This is a wonderful event and
[3:03:49] we've been waiting a lot of years.
[3:03:51] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[3:03:53] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[3:03:54] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[3:03:55] So, I'm um I'm going to take a a look at
[3:03:58] a scripture that is very familiar to us
[3:04:00] in Acts chapter 8. Sister Tina, we've
[3:04:04] had the privilege to sit down with Tina,
[3:04:05] Joanna, and myself, and go over
[3:04:08] scripture over a number of hours, and
[3:04:11] we've met twice. And um
[3:04:15] &gt;&gt; Oh, God.
[3:04:15] &gt;&gt; It's been wonderful.
[3:04:16] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[3:04:17] &gt;&gt; It's wonderful. She's almost as hard a
[3:04:19] nut to crack as I was.
[3:04:24] &gt;&gt; True.
[3:04:26] You know, some people when they hear the
[3:04:27] gospel, they respond right away. Another
[3:04:29] person hears the gospel and you know,
[3:04:31] it's just like fishing. And you feel the
[3:04:32] tug. You want to pull them into the
[3:04:33] boat.
[3:04:34] &gt;&gt; Mhm.
[3:04:35] &gt;&gt; And by the grace of God, she's landed.
[3:04:39] &gt;&gt; And this is real. It's not something
[3:04:41] that somebody has persuaded her into. A
[3:04:44] mother has come, sisters have come. This
[3:04:47] is an individual affair that is
[3:04:49] happening to you, sister Tina.
[3:04:51] &gt;&gt; And that's what we said. Everybody has
[3:04:53] their own path. And the scripture says,
[3:04:55] "He knoweth the way that I take."
[3:04:58] &gt;&gt; And he knew the way that you would go,
[3:04:59] Sister Tina. He knew the years that
[3:05:02] would go by. But as in a garden, and
[3:05:05] we're in garden season, we're planting
[3:05:06] gardens. The radishes, the the different
[3:05:08] lettuce, the different things that
[3:05:10] spring up right away for your salads,
[3:05:12] &gt;&gt; they are sprouting.
[3:05:14] &gt;&gt; But the corn,
[3:05:15] &gt;&gt; the squash, the things that are coming
[3:05:18] up in the garden at the end of the
[3:05:19] season,
[3:05:20] &gt;&gt; they take a little longer.
[3:05:22] &gt;&gt; And so, Sister Tina, you might take a
[3:05:24] little longer. I'm not going to call you
[3:05:26] a squash.
[3:05:28] &gt;&gt; I was going to
[3:05:30] But can I say she's corn
[3:05:35] &gt;&gt; at harvest time?
[3:05:37] &gt;&gt; And it's a great wonderful thing
[3:05:40] &gt;&gt; that God can start dealing with hearts
[3:05:42] amongst a church such as this.
[3:05:45] &gt;&gt; You don't know what's going on, but God
[3:05:47] is working behind the scenes, Sister
[3:05:48] Tina. And heaven's come down and he's
[3:05:50] dealt with your soul.
[3:05:51] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[3:05:52] &gt;&gt; And it's a great thing that I'm standing
[3:05:55] here tonight. Glory
[3:05:56] &gt;&gt; with a a young lady that has a desire
[3:05:59] for the things of God. And I'll tell you
[3:06:01] one thing, they're very few and far
[3:06:02] between.
[3:06:03] &gt;&gt; Yes, they are.
[3:06:04] &gt;&gt; And I feel very privileged to be a part
[3:06:06] of this tonight. And the Bible says,
[3:06:07] "And the angel of the Lord spake unto
[3:06:09] Philip, saying, arise, go towards the
[3:06:12] south unto a way that goeth from
[3:06:14] Jerusalem unto Gaza, which is desert."
[3:06:19] My Bible tells me God knew
[3:06:22] &gt;&gt; where that Ethiopian
[3:06:24] unic would be. and sent a messenger.
[3:06:27] &gt;&gt; And I believe God knew Sister Tina
[3:06:29] exactly where you would be at the time
[3:06:32] of life that you're living and God
[3:06:34] interrupted you.
[3:06:35] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[3:06:37] &gt;&gt; And many many have the same testimony.
[3:06:40] Come to church
[3:06:41] &gt;&gt; and not really even feel that God spoke
[3:06:43] to you.
[3:06:45] &gt;&gt; Come and watch another baptism.
[3:06:47] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[3:06:48] &gt;&gt; And wonder what am I doing here?
[3:06:52] But God works in mysterious ways, his
[3:06:54] wonders to perform.
[3:06:56] &gt;&gt; And God started to deal with your life,
[3:06:58] Tina.
[3:06:58] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[3:06:59] &gt;&gt; And I believe that this is an eternal
[3:07:01] work that he's done in your life.
[3:07:04] &gt;&gt; Turned you around.
[3:07:05] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[3:07:06] &gt;&gt; You've lost desire for the things of the
[3:07:08] world. And God has given you a heavenly
[3:07:10] taste for the things of God. Glory to
[3:07:13] God.
[3:07:13] &gt;&gt; And we're thankful that you've turned
[3:07:14] your heart to Christ
[3:07:16] &gt;&gt; and you've accepted him as your personal
[3:07:18] savior. Have you not?
[3:07:19] &gt;&gt; Yes, I have. All right, let's bow our
[3:07:22] heads in a word of prayer.
[3:07:25] &gt;&gt; Father,
[3:07:30] &gt;&gt; Lord, we've sung the song already
[3:07:32] tonight. This is like heaven to me.
[3:07:35] &gt;&gt; I'm sure, Lord God, that the angels of
[3:07:37] God are rejoicing yet even tonight
[3:07:40] over decisions that are made.
[3:07:43] &gt;&gt; She's put first things first.
[3:07:46] She's looked at Jesus Christ, the author
[3:07:48] and finisher of her faith. And there is
[3:07:51] something that's beating in her heart,
[3:07:52] the once more of God. And so, Lord, your
[3:07:56] word is declared if you repent and are
[3:07:58] baptized in the name of Jesus Christ for
[3:08:00] the remission of your sins.
[3:08:02] You shall then grant to her, Lord, you
[3:08:05] shall fill her with the Holy Ghost and
[3:08:08] fire. So we're praying Lord that as
[3:08:10] brother Biscol had said, we just don't
[3:08:12] want to baptize her to get wet, but we
[3:08:14] desire that the great baptizer come
[3:08:16] down. Fill her heart and fill her soul
[3:08:20] &gt;&gt; with the thing of God, the great holy
[3:08:23] presence of Jesus Christ.
[3:08:25] &gt;&gt; Would you bless her, Lord? Would you
[3:08:27] fill her
[3:08:28] &gt;&gt; and make her life fruitful and may the
[3:08:31] meekness and spirit of Christ ever be
[3:08:34] her portion?
[3:08:35] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[3:08:36] &gt;&gt; Bless sister Tina now. God
[3:08:39] &gt;&gt; in Jesus name.
[3:08:41] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[3:08:42] &gt;&gt; Amen. Sister Tina.
[3:08:47] &gt;&gt; By your confession that Jesus Christ is
[3:08:50] your savior, I baptize you in true
[3:08:53] Christian baptism in the name of our
[3:08:56] Lord Jesus Christ. Amen.
[3:09:04] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[3:09:06] [Applause]
[3:09:11] [Music]
[3:09:17] Oh, wonderful. Let's just stand. We're
[3:09:20] going to thank him. I just want to sing
[3:09:23] the chorus on the wings of a snow white
[3:09:25] dove. This is
[3:09:28] This is
[3:09:31] for Tina, for Sister Tina.
[3:09:34] On the wings of a snow white dove, God
[3:09:37] sends his pure, sweet love. A sign from
[3:09:42] above, on the wings of a dove. May that
[3:09:46] dove be with her this evening and
[3:09:49] throughout all of her days.
[3:09:53] On the wings of the stores
[3:09:59] [Music]
[3:10:01] his pure
[3:10:03] sweet
[3:10:04] love a sign from above.
[3:10:11] On the wings of a
[3:10:15] gain of course now on the wings of a
[3:10:19] storm
[3:10:29] [Music]
[3:10:36] on the way.
[3:10:39] Let's just sing it real softly and
[3:10:41] prayerfully once more. On the wings of a
[3:10:46] snow
[3:10:48] white
[3:10:49] dove,
[3:10:51] God sends his pure
[3:10:54] sweet
[3:10:56] love, a sign from above
[3:11:04] on the wings of
[3:11:09] [Music]
[3:11:10] our Lord Jesus,
[3:11:12] one day you stood good as you just came
[3:11:14] up out of the water and the heavens were
[3:11:18] opened and a dove in the spirit in the
[3:11:22] form of a dove came down. The prophet of
[3:11:26] God said as a a light from heaven as an
[3:11:30] angel light came down from heaven and
[3:11:33] father through the lips of our Lord
[3:11:36] Jesus Christ. That same one who spoke
[3:11:40] and said, "You shall receive power
[3:11:45] after that the Holy Ghost has come upon
[3:11:48] you." And may our sister Tina, Father,
[3:11:51] be infused with his a great and mighty
[3:11:55] power. I pray, Father, that she will be
[3:11:58] completely permeated and saturated. And
[3:12:02] I pray, oh father, a mighty deliverance
[3:12:04] will be her portion and that her lips
[3:12:07] will be anointed, oh God, to give
[3:12:10] witness and testimony and testify of the
[3:12:13] glorious work that you have done. This
[3:12:16] is a work of creation.
[3:12:18] &gt;&gt; Lord, let this creative work, let Christ
[3:12:21] be formed in her. May Christ Jesus, may
[3:12:25] you be seen. This is your work, not
[3:12:28] man's work, your work. Pray you'll bless
[3:12:32] this group of people, Lord, that have
[3:12:34] been through this service this evening.
[3:12:37] Those that have traveled far from
[3:12:39] Seattle Tacoma. Lord, I pray
[3:12:43] now you'll hear me. I know you will. Let
[3:12:46] your presence be in their audible bills
[3:12:49] of the people as they journey in their
[3:12:53] homes when they go to their room
[3:12:56] tonight. May there just be a strange and
[3:12:59] wonderful presence. Testify of yourself,
[3:13:03] Lord, to each one. I pray for the peace
[3:13:07] of God will fill every heart and life,
[3:13:10] oh God. And I ask, Father, that the joy
[3:13:14] of the Holy Spirit as your prophet spoke
[3:13:17] of such wonderful joy that the apostles
[3:13:20] and the disciples had. Fill every heart,
[3:13:23] I pray, with joy unspeakable and full of
[3:13:27] glory. And give your children a glorious
[3:13:30] week. I pray. I commit them to you now
[3:13:33] in Jesus Christ's name. Thank you for
[3:13:36] each one, each one that testified, each
[3:13:39] one that spoke. I pray, Father, that
[3:13:42] something that's been spoken will anchor
[3:13:44] in our hearts. And we'll give you all
[3:13:47] the praise and all the glory in Jesus
[3:13:51] Christ's name. Amen.
[3:13:54] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[3:13:55] &gt;&gt; And amen. I say we can greet one another
[3:13:59] and if we don't have another Lord's day,
[3:14:03] we'll see you on the other side,
[3:14:06] &gt;&gt; will we?
[3:14:08] &gt;&gt; Amen. God bless you. Remember, next next
[3:14:12] Sunday is just one service uh one
[3:14:15] service on account of the long weekend.
[3:14:17] So, next Sunday we'll have one service
[3:14:19] in the morning. See you Wednesday, Lord
[3:14:21] willing. Friday prayer meeting.
[3:14:25] You're all dismissed in Jesus name.
[3:14:28] Bless you.
[3:14:30] God bless, brother John.
