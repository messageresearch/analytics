from Europe overseas Switzerland god bless you and all those that are here this morning it's just just a wonderful time to be in the presence of God looking forward to the word looking forward to a wonderful week I just got one announcement for we have brother David come to the front and minister how many are unable to be at the camp on Sunday next Sunday morning how many despite lifting up your hand give me an idea who can't be there okay way high so I can just understand what we'd like to open the church and have a streaming here so for those that can't make it down there we'd like to make it very special for you and we've normally last few years opened up the sanctuary and and had the streaming here in the sanctuary so that's what we are planning and we'll have a deacon here next week and so service will be starting 10 o'clock next Sunday morning at a Mount Baker Bible Way camp so the service here will be starting also at 10 o'clock well we've got the privilege this morning to introduce to you brother David and he's going to come and minister to us he's been a very special friend over the years I've had the privilege to be in Switzerland where people from brothers and sisters from around the world actually have gathered to to be together to hear the word of God and Without Borders and it's been marvelous and the words that had been spoken by men of God it had been tremendously life impacting and there had to be young men that God raised up to make an event take place a lot of people say well I'd like to do something and it's always a light to do but never do but then they're men that actually like to do something and they do it and brother brother Bisco will be coming to say maybe a few words but brother Daniel : Brenner and brother David Maher they have worked together over these years now many years and people from all over the world have travelled to be in Switzerland and so we're bringing a little bit of that here this morning and I'm expecting a wonderful wonderful move of the word within our lives seeing what God's done in Switzerland he's doing here he's doing it around the world and we feel very privileged to have you here brother David and God bless you he blessed us at camp last year took both morning services and we were immensely strengthened in the Lord and this morning I know you will be blessed so I'm just gonna ask brother ed if you would just come give a greeting thank you while you're still standing I just want to I want to welcome each of you and I want you to know that this brother behind my brother David Meyer we all have different gifts his is a gift of pressure and because of that we have gone that's why one day say to this congregation that's why we've gone each Easter to Switzerland is because he starts putting on the pressure and he has a unique gift we're happy to have an as brother tom has said and his brother David's children David and children and well welcome you to this service and each you that are visiting brother John lay I'm glad it gets hot down there Louisiana it is hot here but alas as our sister from Tucson said it's not this is just lonely your heat is just wonderful well we were happy to hear that anyway I just wanted to say before brother David comes to minister this morning early I just began to ponder the Word of God and the statement that the prophet of God made in his last service and I want to emphasize the last service leadership and he asks the question who's leaving you now so we don't want the weather to lead us we don't want financial conditions to lead us we don't want you know are just a realm of fellowship to lead us I want to say to this congregation that he who came and used profit in a very special way there were many people perhaps many more than are here but each one that came up and they began and then he would come he speaking of our Lord Jesus Christ the angel of the Lord would be at the pulpit and now our brother Branham is not here but the God he served is here the God he served remains the same and this God friends knows every one of you and he knows me I'm so glad he knows me I'm so glad he knows you and the word that our brother David will speak is the word that is a discerner of the thoughts and the intents of the heart and so you better have come you've been led here somehow some way you've been led I want you to recognize I'm here because I've been led here and the one who lair has led me knows me and knows my unique special need and he is here to give me the answer I want to throw this week to listen very closely to the meetings to the preaching in this morning listen very close by the James sister Shirley thank you for the lovely afternoon at your place and evening we really appreciate that brother Murphy for your labors of love god bless you brother David take your liberty please public Spithead thank you no pressure amen good morning Saints there's something about being in the presence of God amen hallelujah and certain certainly a great honor and privilege to be standing before the redeemed of the Lord amen and I pray you will help me preach I'm not used to speaking English but I'll try my best and I pray it will be a blessing for you first of all I want to thank brother Tom and brother ed for the confidence you have and may God richly bless them they've been a great blessing to us every time we had them over not just to us personally but for the bride on the other side of the ocean and different continents they have been a great great blessing in our lives and in many many lives so we really want to give God the glory amen because God is using vessels amen and we sure happy to have vessels that's fully surrendered amen so but certainly I want to thank you personally for letting your pastor go and sharing and brother ed says I put pressure but they put pressure on me now so may God help us amen but it's a great honor to be standing before the redeemed of the Lord amen and I hope you came up prayed up you came here prayed up amen because you know prayer is a powerful weapon if you didn't came prayed up for the brand says you can pass right by God's blessing and not know it if you're not prayed up amen so prayer is not a little something you do five minutes before entering church amen we want to get a blessing out of the service I don't want it to be just an ordinary service Amen or camper glory be to God we're gonna have a wonderful camp Aimie but i don't know what tomorrow holds now i want my blessing amen and if there is a deep calling there's gonna be a deep that will answer amen amen and how wonderful it is a man to know that that we live in a glorious time I'm just gonna keep you a few moments not long but we know the Bible says every time Satan comes up like a flood the Lord raises his standards and we know through the Bible and the message how the four horse riders the the wide the red the black and the pale went forth but God sent anointings amen so there was a lion to meet a Roman age next was the the second horse that the Beast that went to meet was an ox and an ox is a beast of sacrifice and like brother bran said they went down and martyrdom during the Dark Ages the third beast was the the beast with a face of man that was the intellectual age the Reformers Luther Wesley Calvin Knox Finney etcetera but then he says notice what went forth in the evening time what time are we living in brothers and sisters a man what went forward in the evening time is an eagle and for a brother cries out a needle amen prophetic back again it shall be light in the evening time so we have so much to rejoice amen when he come into the house of God we cannot have a sad face I keep saying back home in church I like to see smiling faces because God gave us so much we have so much to be happy about amen so I pray this morning you're gonna be happy because God oh yes arise and shine for your glory has come a man so but what a grace it is to be living under the anointing of the ego when you look to the four animals there's only one not earthbound that's not a coincidence we're flying out of here soon and very soon amen I'm gonna meet my Lord and Savior amen so let us rejoice and be glad in it amen amen amen and Satan can come around and make you lots of promises amen you know he comes around whether we young whether we all he comes around and makes lots of promises am I the only one he makes promises to help me preach now he makes many promises but he has nothing to give you amen because he don't have nothing you hear me well he don't have nothing amen what is Satan run around says anything contrary to the word amen amen amen so how thankful I am for the Word of God amen and the anointing that we're living under a man because the God doesn't make any mistakes God is perfect amen and his plan is certainly perfect when we look to the Sun you see the magnetic power how it holds the stars the planets everything the moon in place but now what about the power of the s o N amen oh he knows his eyes are on the sparrow his eyes are on each and every I don't know what you're going through but I know the one who holds everything in his hands and amen and he's certainly worthy of our praise a many many men not to keep you longer if you can take the Word of God so I bring you greetings on behalf of my wife and family and the church back home and again I say thank you for for sharing Brad Brad the ministry and and your precious precious aim and hallelujah let's say the word of God and Galatians 4 Galatians 4 verse 1 you can say Amen when you're there now I say that the air as long as he is a child deferred nothing from a servant though he be Lord of all verse 2 but is under tutors and governors until the time appointed of the Father even so we when we were children we were in bondage under the elements of the world but when the fullness of time was come God sent forth his son made of a woman made under the law to redeem then them that were under the law that we might receive the adoption of sons and because ye are sons God has sent for the spirit of his son into your hearts crying Abba Father wherefore there are no more servant but a son and if a son then an heir of God through Christ hallelujah that's shouting material amen Ephesians 1 verse 4 seasons 1 verse 4 according as he had chosen us in him before the foundation of the world that we should be holy and without blame before him in love having predestinated us unto the adoption of children by Jesus Christ to himself according to the good pleasure of his will to the praise of the glory of His grace wherein he had made us accepted in the beloved hallelujah one final portion of the scripture John 16 verse 28 Jesus is saying I come forth from the father and I'm coming to the world again I leave the world and go to the Father may God had a blessing to the reading of his word let us pray our precious Heavenly Father how we counted such a great honor and privilege to be in the house of God knowing father that your word says there were two or three are gathered in my name that you are amongst us so father God we don't just gather for for a gathering but Lord we come under expectation and we gather in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ knowing father that you know what I have lead off so I pray Lord God may you have total Liberty this morning may you take me out of the way father God ohai me behind a cross Lord and may you use me father Lord to speak to the bride Lord to each and every one of us father we are a needy people but oh you are a mighty god so bless each and every one father God and through the preaching of the word may people be Lord delivered may they be healed made a be set free Lord God you're still the Great God ship of a father so lord have liberty this morning we pray and ask these things in Jesus Christ's name Amen and amen and amen you may be seated hallelujah amen and and prayer when brother Tom asked me to take this morning service I was praying and looking for searching the will of God and because it's not just preach a sermon many good sermons can be preached but we want to seek the will of God because God he knows what you have need of a man and I was thinking and and I appreciate what brother had said just before about amen leadership Amen how he is leading us amen and I was thinking about the great mind of God and then and I was reading an article and and something was said about Einstein I don't know how many have heard about Einstein but I presume everybody has heard about Einstein I'm not gonna preach about about Einstein you know about his different theories of relativity e equals MC square and so on that's not important but he did say one thing that caught my attention and I like the quote he says I want to know God's thoughts the rest are details hallelujah I want to know God's thoughts the rest are of none importance now I can have many thoughts about brother Tom brother ed brother Joe or whoever or even bout my life or about my family but that's not what is important I want to know God's thoughts about me hallelujah and that's what we're gonna look into this morning amen to to go into the great mind Eamon and how thankful we can be amen the Eagle anointing God sent as a prophet messenger that could go back in the back parts of his mind amen to show us who we are what we are why we are here so all the rests young people and all the people my retirement or my career or whatever is of none importance I'm sorry that's easy for you to say brother David no it ain't it's nothing but the Word of God people are so focused and we just read John 16 Haman Jesus saying I come from the Father and I'm coming to the world again I leave the world and go to the Father now listen brother Branham says we come out of eternity stepped into a little time-space here and step out of time back into eternity so no matter if you have 100 years under 2150 let's be generous this morning 150 years of good health and everything you can think of is nothing compared to eternity Laurie hallelujah so for a title this morning I would like to take how precious are thy thoughts unto me so if you think you know better than God you know you're not gonna like the preaching but how precious are thy thoughts unto me 1 John 3 verse 2 says beloved now are we the sons of God and it does not yet appear what we shall be but we know that we know that not intellectual knowing but by revelation given by God Himself we know that when he shall appear we shall be like him Damon for we shall see him as he is hey man now a lot of Christians today message believers have a problem accepting and and the songs were perfect arise possess your inheritance Damon it's there for the taking I have to take my inheritance you have to take your inheritance your blessing but I've to do the same each and every one we have to take but that's our blessing and if you don't want it I'll take yours but many believers today have problems accepting their position mm-hmm because they look through their eyes and not through the eyes of God so it's not a complicated message I'm gonna preach this morning I have no new message sorry I've got one doctrine that is Christ amen and now I'm gonna preach Christ amen so if you heard it before well give glory to God God knows Amen what we have need of amen so the problem is if we look through our eyes we're gonna see all kinds of crazy things but if you look through the eyes of God that's what matters that's what really matters amen Romans 3 says let God be true but every man be a liar so no matter what a man can say how beautiful it can sound let that be alive but God's Word be the absolutes amen now to lay a foundation hey man let's continue and I'm gonna build up so be patient with me I'm on holiday so hi I'm Brad Brent says I'm a believer in what God says in his word now he says I can show you by the Bible where God has given the authority has given the power but know where I can find where he has taken it away come on bride hallelujah nowhere in the Bible I can find where God has taken it away so we are living under our god-given privileges because the power is there Haman but God is looking he says we need man who is willing to stand on what God said to be the truth now I'm gonna include the sister sorry I'm gonna add a little here we need men and women who's willing to stand on what God said to be the truth that's the atmosphere we need that's my prayer for this morning that's the atmosphere we need and that's why we come to church being prayed up because we don't want to have another church I want another blessing another portion amen Oh hallelujah so that's the atmosphere we need and you know everybody is a creator we have to create the atmosphere so I can look to brother and brother Tom or you can look to your neighbor but it's up to you to create your atmosphere amen you have her love the World Cup and the football and people they go crazy and things like that for a bowl at the end of the game they still have problems they still have all their trouble going to but now here God tells us know where I can find in the word where the power has been taken away so if you have a need this morning he is still the same so there's a lot to read oh brother David you want emotions oh no I want to get glory to God he's worried of my praise listen he needs man who's willing to stand stand on the word Peter you know the story Peter was in with his disciples and the boats and then Jesus came along now Peter didn't walk on water Preda David what are you saying I'll make it clear to you Matthew for 1428 says and Peter answered to him and said lord if it be thou bid me come unto thee on the water and the Lord answered he said come so Peter walked on the world [Applause] but at UM last Sunday he said we stand on the word now so God is looking for brothers and sisters that don't look to circumstances around but I'm looking on the world of God I don't know how high the mountain can be how deep the water can be but I know my Lord will never heaven and earth will pass away but the Word of God will never pass away so we have to cease to listen to our own IDs I have to decrease he has to increase Isaiah 55 talking about the thoughts of God for my thoughts are not your thoughts neither are your ways my ways save the Lord so stop wasting your time with your thoughts and concentrate on God's thoughts for your life 2 Corinthians 10 verse 5 casting down imaginations and every high thing that exalteth itself against the knowledge of God and bringing into captivity every thought to the obedience of Christ [Applause] that's where the greatest battle is false but God gave us what we have need of to be victorious so if you feel this morning spiritually dry do like Moses raise your hands and win your battle because with God and the Word of God amen there's no defeat all the laws of gravity or no matter how many laws that can be they don't apply when the word when you live by the word when you walk by the word amen hallelujah so just raise your hands and like brother Brown says you defy gravity I like to show Satan's soon and very soon name just like Enoch I'm gonna go home a many many men but now Haman in verse four it says it talks about strongholds now some of our thoughts can have a very strong hold on alive mm-hmm and those strongholds they lead to complexes frustrations depressions hatreds everything that's from Satan but now relevance says dull listen to any reasoning lest your crown be taken and give to another don't take any reasoning at all just believe what God said is just through it and stay with it not just believe one day and the next service you're down again the word says from glory to glory so come on our slaw should be getting bigger and bigger the powers of testimony should becoming bigger and bigger cool hallelujah hallelujah amen so we're at Ephesians 1 by calling as he had chosen us in him a Mandir so there's no mention about us doing something you agree he had chosen us in him before the foundation of the world talking about Amazing Grace amen amen amen so why would we need to inject my ID or somebody's ID when this is God's own idea about it it is that simple and though it creates so many problems because we have our human thoughts mm-hmm John 15 says ye have not chosen me but I have chosen you hallelujah that that's for me just this verse is enough to worship him for the rest of the service it wasn't depending on me relying on me on how strong how good how bad or whatever he chose me hallelujah to God be glory hallelujah amen amen so the Bible is not a book of system another book of morals or a book of history it is the revelation of Jesus Christ amen it is a revelation of Jesus Christ listen brethren says God himself revealed from word to flesh hallelujah Oh brothers and sisters we are living in a time where God sent his prophet messenger a son of God revealing the son a minutes hallelujah this is a glorious time brothers and sisters Hey many many many men then this if that is a revelation of Jesus Christ and he chose us in him then this is the revelation of who we are I'm not inventing anything here I I am simple I love simple preaching but oh how deep it is because when the bride gets a real revelation of who she is then the rapture will take place Haman so there's something about a man getting the revelation not mental but a revelation from God amen I came from God amen stepped into a little time a little lapse of time but I go back to eternity Laurie a many many many many man the message listened the message is not about brother Branham and with all respect the message is about us listen talking about thoughts that's the way he was he was in the beginning by himself God well the long is his source he'll never do that again cuz his thoughts are being made manifest and that's why we are right here this they amen that's why we are right here this day God fellowshipping with his thoughts being manifest [Applause] yeah now let's look to the thoughts of God the Deacons should open the door so Satan and all his demons can run out you should be I often quote it you should be Satan and all its demonic powers worst nightmare there's the question all the thoughts of God eternal God is unchangeable in both essence and behavior he's omniscient never had a new thought about anything oh you think about it brother Tom never had a new thought about anything thus the thoughts of God are eternal and it doesn't end there they are real [Applause] so 139 for thou hast possessed my reigns thou has covered me in my mother's womb I will praise thee for I am fearfully and wonderfully made away with all the complexes my nose is too sexual my ears of my hair on my skin or this or that to talk to them come on the world God says I am fearfully and wonderfully made [Applause] marvelous are thy works and that my soul knoweth right well my soul right well God is not looking for jellyfish he's not looking for jellyfish Christians hey man you'll never get anything by being a little jellyfish Christian although we live in Lao DC we see many jellyfish the waves bring them brother Branham says and here comes a crab and cups them in pieces so that's why when you feel spiritually dry start praising God say thank you Lord for my blessing brother David I don't see my blessing given praise and good and about times it's worthy of the praise he loves to be praised we need some Christian not jellyfish but with a backbone battle strand like Peter on the world of God the ways when he looked through his eyes and with his thoughts it was wow that is a big wave yeah and that's how we look in our lives brothers and sisters I've been struggling with this I had this sickness for so many years and we look through our eyes our thoughts but now he says by His stripes I am already here ask and ye shall receive but when you look for the word of God and stand upon the world of God mother jellyfish and loudly say Amen ho but stand on the pure knowledge doesn't world of God how are you gonna have the victory because this is the year of Jubilee amen let's continue my substant was not hid from thee when I was made in secret and curiously wrought in the lowest part of the earth then eyes did see my substance yet being unperfect and in the book all my members were written which in continuance were fashioned when as yet there was none of them how precious are also guys thoughts unto me Oh God how great is this some of them listen in the amplified version for you for my innermost parts you knit me together in my mother's womb I will give sounds and praise to you for I am fearfully and wonderfully made wonderful are your works and my soul knows it very well my frame was not hidden from you when it was being formed in secret and listened and intricately and skillfully formed as if embroidered with many colors in the depths of the earth Oh God he's so good he many many many many men now God hath thoughts it and we see no the thought there was eternal and had to be expressed now we can see we can find Moses Jeremiah John the Baptist and each one of them brother had brother Tom brother John brother Tim brother David come on you can put your name there he had chosen us in him before the foundation of the world Haman and each one of these were God's eternal thoughts expressed in its season but glory be to God he chose us for the very best and [Applause] although it's very dark cloudy sea is very dark very cold and even in some way a great temptation Satan comes with many promises but he has nothing to offer but God comes with the Eagle anointing he meant to say how we can live a victorious life a man so stop listening to the nonsense of Satan and start obeying the Word of God and your body will have to obey the Word of God so we are God's thought expressed in its season now listen that gives I have many atomic bombs here that's how I don't call them Nuggets sorry because the Word of God is almighty that gives an eternal quality to the elect you want to talk about quality mm-hmm you can't get away from that so even if you want to try you can't get away of the eternal quality because you are chosen in him God's elect we sang this song possess your inheritance so that means somewhere we have an inheritance a preach sell it back home about several service our inheritance so when you receive an inheritance the smile comes on the face yeah wonderful I got your attention we have obtained an inheritance somebody has to leave you something says brother branham God before the foundation of the world left you something and that's what we're looking into now this morning if what did he leave us what did he give us so we can walk out of here victorious possess our inheritance because this is the year of Jubilee God before the foundation of the world left you something a name written on the book that when the lamb would be slain you'd be recognized with it to God be the glory talking about an inheritance that's more precious than gold that's why God wrote my name your name in the Lamb's Book of Life before there was even a star before there wasn't an atom before there was there was nothing but God had his plan made up he had thoughts eternal quality and he expressed them now he sealed the book with seven seals he seals it but he opens it for who for who possess your inheritance now God he went talking about the eternal quality he says the picture brought around this picture is the main thing when was it taken before there was a foundation of the world they was put in God's great file and I don't care what they would do to you how many trials hmm don't get quiet on me now I don't care what they would do with you they cannot destroy that profile that picture in God's great gallery of their it cannot be destroyed because it's eternal quality [Applause] aren't you happy God expressed his thoughts I wouldn't be here we wouldn't be here but you said let there be and there is oh I'm still billing Jeremiah 29 verse 11 for I know the thoughts that I think toward you hallelujah I know the thoughts that I think toward you say the Lord thoughts of peace and not of evil to give you an expected end [Music] God gave us something our inheritance he gave us a man he says burn around what is this book of redemption this title deed abstract title deed what does an abstract means good question that means it search all the way back to its beginning before you were even formed in the womb of your mom there was a title deed mm-hmm hallelujah and then he says amen it's Redemption means all legal possession to all that was lost by Adam and Eve he says oh my brother branham claps his hands together amen what ought that to do to a born-again Christian so I wonder this morning what I ought to do to us when we hear God talking to us know brother Dave brother Dave is nobody but God I'm just echoing the Word of God because I love to hear what God thinks of me don't you flori you didn't become a Christian just by coincidence you are not here rather I'd mention it you are not here by coincidence you can think maybe you're smart now be careful when you think you're smarter than God you think you chose you chair God knew he knows how many hairs I have he knows my heartbeat he knows my blood pressure he knows he knows everything about you you didn't become a Christian just by coincidence because you become a Christian before he was in the world in this world before you were born God ordained you to be a Christian your mind is darkened to that now sure that's why we can say thank you Lord because he came to me when I was completely in a mess and all maybe a religious system or maybe in the world or maybe an alcoholic or a drug addict or whatever he came to me hallelujah do you know what predestinate means predestination of anything was pre saw by God mm-hmm now don't stumble at this word that's what program says God had thoughts and the word came out word is a thought expressed hainan so God in the beginning was life the eternal one in him was attributes and those attributes became words and the word became flesh Jesus was the Redeemer and to redeem means to bring back just like we saw so you see all people listen up Brennan says all people will never be able to see it because all people wasn't in the beginning in God's talks call brother David you are being so mean this morning am i it's nothing but the Word of God so yes some people will never see it that's why you see a lot of people they can hold on hold on for years and all of a sudden they fall astray how is it possible oh you think you're somebody brother David you think you're a favorites of God I had didn't have found favor in God's eyes just like all of us but that's God's choosing not mine and that's God's plan a many many many men now he elected us before the foundation of the world and when I was a young kid I'm still young thank you [Laughter] like when we wanted to play soccer we took two two guys and we made up teams and of course as a kid you want to be on the best of the you know the best soccer player or the best baseball player or whatever basketball player so you're there I hope I'm in his team I hope I'm in his team but now by God's grace it's not up to me I hope I hope I hope I God by grace chose me chose you in him from before the foundation of the world Amen so he's worthy of all my praise because when I was small and I was not in a good team well you know I was Old Town but now by the grace of God I can't rejoice with Lori to God even when I'm in a big trial election looks back to foreknowledge and predestination looks to destiny that City that's my destiny where you had a brothers I'm going home soon and very soon I'm going home it's only a matter of moments now amen Israel the time clock Oh God some pieces right on time so you better be in the atmosphere of the rapture by full military force so is knowing that he was a savior Amen there was no Angels no nothing just God ella ella him the self-existent one nothing but him alone he was a savior Emma was a savior amen many pretends what's he's going to safe there's nothing lost knowing that he know that this great attribute in him would project something out yonder that he could save then when it did that by forage he looked down and he saw every one that would accept it how great is our God that's how powerful God is though I became a Christian because I wanted to but no that's nonsense God pre sign from be father from the world I knew I was going to say yes hello and then by doing so he said to save that the only way I can do it I will become down myself and be made flesh and take the sin of man upon him and die for him amen listen that I may be the one that's worshipped do you hear me correctly that I may be the one that is worshipped so not brother so-and-so not brother so-and-so brother Brown says the C gene found you what did I do to see gene found me hmm doesn't get any more complicated than that but how do I react on that word come on now you want a plain language thank you brother John in very plain language the true Bride of Christ was in the mind of God eternally though not expressed until each H came forth but thus this bride is the literal spoken word seed bride let that being a bride without spot or wrinkle brother David you still have lots of spots and wrinkles you're not looking through the right eyes your thoughts on the GOP's thoughts because god's thoughts are eternal quality I know what I used to be maybe I know what I ought to be but I'm on my way we did not become seed by the rebirth we were seen and therefore were reborn for only the legs can be reborn and so were you sons of god and daughters of God before there even was a moon a star Michael for there's only one form of eternal life and that was you before that shouting material hey man no sickness can't stand in the presence of your mighty if you want to talk about the eternal quality when Jesus walked even the demons come no don't don't torment us now we saw in the Word of God that this power is cylinder Josh Laurie as soon as sure as just your gene had to be in your father before your natural birth your spiritual gene had to be in God because you're an expression Laurie do you hear me you are an expression of the attributes of his thoughts before the foundation of the world Wow my my my isn't that something the C gene found you what is a gene now I'm going to give a definition that's very complicated there may be some doctors here or some nurses and you will understand everything but there are some parts that are very interesting in the definition definition of a gene a heredity unit controlling a particular character what character are we talking about Christ okay this genetic element corresponds to a segment of DNA or RNA located at a specific location on a chromosome each region of the DNA that produces a functional RNA molecule is a gene whew that's Chinese sorry brother Murphy listen the nucleus of the cell is the library which contains all the hereditary heritage of the individual the chromosome is a book of this library and the gene is one page of the book Oh God before the foundation of the world wrote down my name in the Lamb's Book of Life I'm one page maybe of the book but God be to God [Applause] you've got your page in it and by God's grace the book has been opened the scenes were broken now now I can see my name in the Lamb's Book of Life that's your inheritance boy since I saw my name in the book of redemption Amon now I am so happy now I can rejoice hey man give glory to God I'm glad my name isn't it says brother Brandon the names written in heaven on the Lamb's Book of Life Oh hallelujah and that's the who's who of God who's the biggest who's the greatest who's the richest who's that I don't care about that I want to look to God says who's who that's the Lamb's Book of Life no one was worthy to open the book hey man John Sean no one was worthy but he came a bloody line man hallelujah he took the book open the seals thereof face and revelation passe and they sung a new song saying thou art worthy to take the book and to open the seals for thou was slain and hast redeemed outside to God by the blood out of every kindred and tongue and people and nation oh there's a bride rising all over the world and she walks in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ joy and hast made us unto our God kings and priests and we shall reign on the earth this is not a little happening the Angels the cherubims the four and twenty elders the beasts everything uncrowned himself fell down before the throne and said worthy are thou John said everything in heaven heard me hollering hollering [Applause] heard me hollering a men screaming hallelujah and praises to God the scream went up why their names was in the book to be revealed and revealed it not will reveal they're talking about a happy time I'm quoting the Prophet let us rejoice and be glad for a bride has made herself ready what would nothing but the pure Word of God talking about a happy time when the seals broke John which is a type of the bride John must have looked in and see past the curtain of time and said there is John hallelujah okay brother David that's very nice John he went beyond the curtain of time to see there's John okay no problem you know the prophets of God they don't make mistakes so this message this word is perfect sorry if you don't agree with me that's what I believe God doesn't make mistakes now listen brother branham he had an experience women where he went beyond the curtain of time we all know this story hallelujah brother brother Brennan said and I see [Music] include yourself but I'm sorry I let it be according to your face God gave me all I've need of a man for perfect factor now even the rapture is in Jews hey man so the rapture will just be won by by world people can think you're crazy or that I'm crazy I wonder who will be crazy at the end but now that's where we have to play our role we have to go if you look to Revelation then it says I have to go and take the little book eat the little book in order for me to become the little book now Jeremiah says thy words were found and I did eat them and thy word was unto me the joy and rejoicing of mine hearts now when the ministers the men of God come every Wednesday every no matter what day it is preach the Word of God how is your heart responding to the Word of God can you say and thy word is unto me joy and rejoicing of my heart for I am called by thy name o Lord God of hosts brother Bram says after the opening of the seals I'm gonna call you bride miss Jesus Christ I'm called by his name now all Devils out of hell can't erase your name out of there [Applause] [Music] no matter they can be lined up in front of you by the authority of God's Word you can speak and say you cannot erase my name out of the Lamb's Book of Life so he can boast himself he can Bluff he's a good bluff err but you've got the power the authority in Jesus name Amen and he brought unto you Christ and you are secure with Jesus Christ a man you're not standing with your own you're standing in him with one thing I believe God only believe all things are possible now only believe has nothing to do with your thoughts but it has all to do with the Word of God the thoughts of God how do I respond to the Word of God amen all we can go through all the different examples in the Bible but they acted upon the Word of God let it be down according to that well [Applause] but I will be done then Bergeron says why did I fear look at the joy that I missed then many times we come to church services or time meeting sets and then at the end of the service or the end of the camp amen no way no way God wants to bless us so let's not miss your blessing let's not say well the joy that I missed no let's look at every victory I'm gonna take you don't need to take big steps don't worry but every step where your foot hallelujah is yours Satan you're backing up [Applause] now the predestinated is the only one that's considered in Redemption to redeem anything is to bring back to its original place that's why God sent us a prophet messenger to reveal the whole world the whole word all the parts that were left he gathered them and reveal them to us hmm what happy people we ought to be now let's start acting upon the Word of God and let's be happy and take our blessings amen oh it's happy why oh the Sun is going to call it right back oh yes hallelujah I missed the beginning of that one sorry Thank You Rita brother Brown tells the story makes a parallel he talks maybe you've heard it about a little dew drop he says I don't know too much about chemistry but it must be the congealing of humidity or atmosphere and when the knee gets cold and dark it falls from the heavens and drops upon the ground its fell from somewhere but the next morning before the Sun comes up it's lay there the little fellow shivering but just let the Sun come up hallelujah come on Bob just let the Sun come up glory what should go to shine it's happy why the Sun is going to call it right back to come from and that's the way with a Christian we know when we walk into the presence of God something in us when we come into the hands of God something English tells us that we come from somewhere and we're going back again by the power that's pulling us with a bride the Sun is up we have to do is ripen the little Jew drop he listens he shines and he shouts a man that's an attribute of God born of God knows hallelujah when he come in contact with the Son of God he is going to be drawed up from here someday there's no mention about maybe 99.99 percent he might be with God there's no maybe let there be and there is will there be a rapture oh yes and I'm one of them [Applause] how much time do I have when did I start hallelujah oh lord help us we know Leviticus 23:10 it speaks about our gonna read it speak unto the children of Israel and say unto them when you be coming to the land which I give unto you and you shall reap the harvest there of Dan you shall bring a sheaf of the first fruits of your harvest unto the priest and he shall wave the sheaf before the Lord to be accepted for you on the morrow after the Sabbath the priest shall wave it now run Americans and he says now did you notice the seventh day no no not that the first day what we call s UN day it's not s UN anymore it is the som they the Sun day today is the som day that for that corn of wheat God's first one up from the dead is to be waved over the congregation that we are his seed and that's the first of the seed of those that slept wave upon the first day of the week and he raised up waved us goodbye now he continues it's in the rising of the Sun now towards the end God had quickened us his quicken his life raised him up from the dead and he was the first truth of those that slept the first rule he was the show they were the sheaf the first one to come to maturity and it was waved as a memorial of Thanksgiving to God believing that the rest me and you all of us that the rest of them would come [Music] to maturity hallelujah the first he was the first son of God to come to full maturity oh what a glorious lesson he was waged over the promised seed that had promise of life and now to be waves again we realize in the last day according to Luke 1713 in the Sun Bay again Esso and day again in the day of the sson of man that will be revealed or waved again over the people brothers and sisters this is a glorious time that we're living as Christ was the first one to raise from all the prophets and so forth although typed in many places he was the first one of those that slept in the bride coming of Christ coming out of the church there has to be a sheaf waved again in the last days oh my waiting of the sheaf what was the sheaf the first one that come to mature the first one that proved it was a week that proved it was a sheaf now he says hallelujah still in the rising of the Sun I'm sure you see what I'm talking about I ask you the question glory it was waved over the people and the first time they will come forth for the bride age brother David is it another age new the brightest is in laude SIA so there's not going to be an age H I'm not going into there just to put a good foundation he came to call us out of the nomination so I am we are in the bride age although we're still a now this year hmm but now he says Amen for the bride aids for a resurrection out of the dark denominationalism will be a message hallelujah that the full maturity of the world has turned back again in its full power that's for us talking about a happy time talking about a happy people we got lots to be happy about brothers and sisters Amen so he restore he says I will restore say the Lord that means to return to the former owner to bring back to the former estate of condition he's still following eyes back home I say when they when you fall asleep just raise up you'll wake up and you can me see it again but feel free never the Lord is there in spirit Lord is there's Liberty do you know there are some things that we have to do that God cannot do until we do it he furnaces the energy but we got to do the job it becomes personal now redeem is not create something redeem is to bring back that which what was already what has already been so it's not complicated our name was put in a lands book of life and written as redeemed praise the Lord before the before even yeah I was shaped iniquity born in this world and sin but even before all this happened God wrote on this page and he wrote next to it redeemed hallelujah then what are we scared about I asked you the question if God tells you next to your name it says ready what are we scared about Britta David will I make it do you think I will make it God told me I will make it I've already made it because his word says in Ephesians and we read it according as he had chosen us in him before the foundation of the world that we should be how that we should be holy and without blame before him in love the greek lexicon calls his word without blame amended us you don't know what speaks greek here I believe but the French Bible uses a word that I like which is irreproachable either push-out irreproachable the definition of that is honest recommendable reliable consensus incorruptible honest flawless impeccable innocent not guilty authentic sincere perfect the see Jean found me that's what I'm talking about but Brett and David I don't feel like somebody holy and blameless you're looking through your eyes and your thoughts you know a diamond we can all see diamonds and you're all diamonds now we don't see any difference it glitters it shines but now the experts they can categorize on different types of diamonds but now a diamond there's something special because no matter what they look like on the outside listen listen carefully no matter what they look like on the outside all diamonds are made of the same perfect chemical and atomic composition inside it's not wonderful so we can look different but on the inside there's a part of God that he placed in me in us so let's not stop looking on her you so now I want to be like you and I know I want to be like him you work with us to make it to be a son and a daughter of God you're the virtuous Bride of Christ watch in the blood of Christ boy listen Christ couldn't help being what he was now what about a bride hey I'm very simple here but all its mighty powerful Christ couldn't help being what he was and that's the same thing for predestination it brings you right back where you were predestinated you were in God stops to give you the Holy Ghost that's why I said God gave all we have need of but it's up to us to use the Word of God and to live by the Word of God mm-hmm how are you going to stop it [Music] your trials new problems you think that will stop the plan of God your thoughts you think you will stop the plan of God how are you going to stop it all Devils in hell you might as well quit fussing about it because there's going to be a bride without spot or wrinkle we ought to walk like that Satan cannot do anything about it he has nothing to give he lost it all but God he has a dose system at the OS Britta Michael are you know somewhere it's not a disk operating system but it's a divine operating system the C gene of God found you and it cannot fail it's got perfect quality many people talk today about artificial intellect intelligence you know and we upgrade and we upgrade and become smarter and smarter I know one intelligence and that is Christ the head and he's the one I want to follow he's my guide in all things and the good and the bad and then and the biggest storm you might be in and you want to talk about intelligence that's real intelligence because before the foundation of the world he doesn't need to change his thoughts through the ages before there was anything he thought of me he thought of you and he's worthy of my life he's worthy of my praise he was worthy of my all and therefore he paid a price that I can be free a man so he's worthy of all glory amen he was a man that was his purpose of coming I'm winding up now amen to bring God to man and make God and man 1 again this is God's great mystery of love expressed that God and man became one see the whole thing is gone a man gone and man was one there and God and man is one here there's a uniting time going on the wedding supper a man oh I'm going to the wedding supper you know eating time is here I'm gonna do two feast it's a feast and I have a chair with my name on it hey you name it you speak your victory hallelujah aim and what is it being filled with his spirit him having the preeminence that's God's person purpose to do that that he might be in Christ and Christ in us and all this together one I'm winding up now but listen God represented Christ as the Lamb and himself as the Dove when John baptized Jesus at the river of Jordan one of the greatest events that had ever taken place the Lamb the meekest of all creatures of the earth and the Dove the meekest of all fowls of heaven now that's the only way that they could ever be united it's the only way that the dog would ever come on the land as John saw Jesus and he said behold the lamb of God that they could do sin of the world that's when God and man became one the Dove and the lamp United together that's when heaven and earth embraced each other that's when God was made flesh that's when God came down from the spirit form I was made and man and voluminous that's when all eternity embraced each other that was the greatest event this world has ever seen and we'll see can we say amen to that but I love what brother Branham says after until until Christ and the church has united together again that's when God a man became one heaven and earth embraced each other and kissed each other's and saddled listen now and settled the same question the same question forever when the doll and the lamb United together when friend let me tell you something we are God's Lambs he's liking us as sheep and he's my shepherd my guide [Music] maybe some of you have heard the story how in wars they used pigeons to send out messages and there was one pigeon there's a particularity there have equality in themselves where pigeons they are completely devoted to their families and most have an extraordinary ability to home back to them now there was one pigeon in World War one named Cheramie dear friend wha a friend we have in Jesus he's more precious than a brother than his sister he's a real friend when you are down he's by your side when you're in need he's there all you have to do is ask your friend now call your friend in school calling for a friend on the job just call on Jesus and cherami he was a messenger pigeon that flew from the US Army and it's courage and determination saved the lives of almost 200 soldiers on October 4 1918 the 308 battalion in the 77th division hallelujah seven church ages seven seals you know what the name was of that Division Liberty Division and they were trapped in a small depression on the side of a hill behind enemy lines taking deadly fire out of the food and water and they attached messages to their carrier pigeons requesting urgent support the first new pigeon sent was shut bound by German forces they had but one pigeon left Cheramie dear friend the battalion Road on the last message which they attached to Cheramie desperately hoping that she would somehow make it through Cheramie was also shot behind with by enemy fire she was shot in his chest by the German forces while flying across the battle fields with a bullet in her chest one leg hanging what made me think of your testimony brother Tom one leg hanging by a single tendon Jeremy flew 25 miles in 25 minutes to headquarters to deliver the message when she arrived she was blind in one eye covered in blood with a bullet in the chest and a leg literally hanging by a thread the message she delivered saved the lives of 194 men and Jeremy became the hero of the 77th division the Liberty division but now that was a great thing for a little pigeon to do that it costs his blood his blood was on the message but one day it wasn't a pigeon it was a dove when sin had the sons of God pinned down there was no hopes there was nothing that they could do all hope was gone but there came a dog 1,900 years 2,000 years ago born in a manger dying on a cross but he reached heaven with the blood of his ownself on the message and he deliberated the sons of God that now we can be again sons of God and daughters of God to live in holiness and purity to live in its presence oh I'm so thankful for a dog the dogs that came down from glory that took the message that I was in need and he flew back to heaven with it and it was bloody all over where the sins of the world had done but today 29th of July 2018 that's today today I am liberated and free and so glad today you can't be set free today you can be healed the message got there and he got the message to us as brother brother he got the message to us my friends telling me where I come from tell me where I'm going before I stepped into this mask I was already in his thoughts he told me he paid your tempers for me then I can be free this morning [Music] while the musicians come understand I don't need to be a slave anymore I don't need to be a slave many people they think they're

story what a God gave us this morning is my real story this is my story this is my song praising my Savior all day and night long [Music] hallelujah don't miss him now tomorrow we can say oh I missed the joy I miss my blessing I don't want to miss it I don't even know what tomorrow holds brother David you can say that and repeat but it's the truth maybe if you can play the just play softly he chose us in Jesus Christ the devil he ain't even in the race do you hear me little bride do you hear me not brother David God tells us this morning Satan ain't even in the race Satan and all his demons cannot erase my name his thoughts are so precious unto me [Music] how I'm going to make it brother David you've already made it [Music] Christ paid the price for me you wasn't born for this world you was created in the image of God to be what to be a son and a daughter of God I'm no longer a slave to fear I am a child of God it's about time we we believe the word of God and take him at

garlic I believe you're under great expectation for camp so am I this morning now is my moment I don't want to be a slave any longer because I'm a child the king of kings I've been struggling with complexes with many things for years with a sickness but God told me to smile he put something in me of eternal quality and Satan cannot change it but now you got the authority to speak the word talk to our dear friend Jesus calling on the scene and let him do what maybe you've been trying to do for years the woman at the well she came she was trying and trying and trying stop trying just take God

that he opened up with in Psalms 139 17 how precious are thy thoughts unto me O God that's wonderful and we heard a tremendous message this morning but the psalm goes on to say Oh God how great is the sum of them and I thought how perfect was the message this morning not just that we knew the thought of God but he brought us into the some of it I'm getting ready to leave in a twinkling of an eye we
