[3:09] are going to burst wide open.
[3:14] When the angels set
[3:18] my spirit free,
[3:23] going to take my life
[3:27] like a mighty

[3:36] start calling me.
[3:40] Oh, this house of flesh
[3:46] is my py
[3:52] [Music]
[3:56] soul.
[3:59] But the doors of clay
[4:03] are going to burst wide open.
[4:08] When the angels set
[4:12] my spirit free,
[4:16] I'm going to take my flight
[4:21] like a mighty eagle
[4:25] when the hill of home
[4:30] start calling me. Let's sing it again.
[4:34] this house of
[4:37] we're going to step out of this body.

[12:30] Lord, you're found in the praises of
[12:33] your people where two or three would
[12:35] gather. Lord, it's not just words that
[12:37] are written on the page of a book, but
[12:40] it is your mind expressed down to us,
[12:43] Lord, to give us the confidence, Lord,
[12:45] to allow faith to rise up in our souls
[12:48] this morning, to take you at your word.
[12:52] We have gathered this morning not

[13:43] Oh,
[13:45] [Music]
[13:47] how we long
[13:49] to worship
[13:52] you.
[13:56] Hallelujah.
[13:58] Amen. I asked brother David Adamore to
[14:01] come and just lead us in prayer this
[14:03] morning. We have couple of requests to
[14:05] make known. I look down and I see the
[14:07] Ricardo family is together this morning
[14:10] for the Ricardo and Sister Buffy and
[14:12] family. May God bless you.
[14:15] Brother Ricardo wants to ask for prayer
[14:17] for
[14:19] the daughter of his boss at work. He's
[14:22] going into surgery to remove a growth on
[14:24] the brain on Monday.
[14:26] Just ask that the Lord would touch her
[14:29] life.
[14:34] There's a John and Rita Simmons. Rachel
[14:37] Simmons is asking request on their
[14:39] behalf.
[14:40] Uh vehicle Thursday morning
[14:44] hit the side of the house asking for
[14:46] prayer for the family. The father is
[14:48] very distraught asking that he would
[14:51] touch their lives this morning.
[14:54] Sister Ronda Redell has a thanksgiving
[14:58] to express to the congregation for
[14:59] everyone for their prayers and support.
[15:01] All of those who brought food and
[15:03] flowers. May the Lord richly bless you.
[15:05] Most of all, I just want to thank the
[15:07] Lord for always being so faithful to be
[15:09] right by your side, holding your hand
[15:11] every step of the way to carry you
[15:14] through with his peace. All glory and
[15:17] praise be to God. Thank you for bringing
[15:19] back that report, Sister Rhonda. Amen. I
[15:23] think that's the true heart of every
[15:24] believer is to be the one out of the 10
[15:27] lepers that got released. You know, when
[15:30] you have leprosy, you're not allowed to
[15:32] fellowship. You're not allowed to go
[15:34] over to company's house,
[15:36] sit down and have a meal together. You
[15:38] can't come to church when you have an
[15:41] affliction. But when Jesus came and set
[15:43] them free, they could go about normal
[15:44] activities once again.
[15:46] &gt;&gt; But only one found it in their heart to
[15:48] come back. And I think that's the heart
[15:51] of every believer is to come back and
[15:52] give thanks to the Lord
[15:54] &gt;&gt; when he delivers us out of each one of
[15:56] our situations.
[15:58] Amen. Brother David, why don't you come
[15:59] and
[16:01] lead us in prayer this morning? If you
[16:02] have a need upon your heart or you just
[16:04] want to thank the Lord for something
[16:05] that he has done, the house of the Lord
[16:08] is full this morning. It's good to see
[16:09] the saints from Seattle. Brother
[16:11] Machmood, brother Peter I saw just a
[16:13] moment ago and the different ones,
[16:15] Brother Oed, Brother Israel and your
[16:17] families. Brother Solomon, God bless
[16:20] you.
[16:22] This is a great great house of worship.
[16:24] May you just be free in the Holy Spirit
[16:26] this morning to worship God. Brother
[16:29] David,
[16:36] let's just bow our heads and our hearts.
[16:39] &gt;&gt; Our dear heavenly father, we we worship
[16:41] you this morning, oh God. Father, it's a
[16:44] privilege, Lord, to stand with brethren
[16:46] of like, precious faith
[16:48] &gt;&gt; that Lord, we can gather together like
[16:50] this, Lord, and know that we have one
[16:52] common goal, Lord Jesus, and that's to
[16:54] see you glorified, oh God. Father, we we
[16:57] start with thanksgiving, Lord Jesus. We
[16:59] thank you, oh God, for good health,
[17:01] Lord. We thank you for the salvation, oh
[17:04] God, that you brought to us, oh God. We
[17:06] thank you for the Holy Spirit, Lord. We
[17:08] thank you for your salvation, Father.
[17:10] Father, we know, oh God, without you,
[17:12] Lord, we can do nothing. We know, oh
[17:14] God, that we're just mortals, Lord.
[17:17] Father, vessels of clay, Lord. Father,
[17:19] as a microphone, as it were, but Lord,
[17:21] it's your spirit that makes a
[17:23] difference, Lord. how we're reminded of
[17:25] the service once again, Lord, when Jesus
[17:27] came.
[17:28] &gt;&gt; And Father, it's when you came, Lord,
[17:30] that you made the difference, Lord. And
[17:32] we thank you, oh God, that you've
[17:33] considered us this morning to come in
[17:35] our midst, not only, Lord Jesus, in
[17:37] healing Sister Rhonda, Lord, but Father,
[17:39] in the breaking of the bread of life,
[17:41] Lord Jesus. Father, we thank you, oh
[17:44] God, for the healing of the body, not
[17:46] just spiritually, Lord, but physically,
[17:48] Lord God. And father, with these
[17:50] thanksgiving, we come with faith in our
[17:51] hearts, knowing that you can meet every
[17:53] need, Lord, for this little one who's
[17:55] going for surgery, Lord Jesus. Father,
[17:57] you're the one that created the brain,
[17:59] Lord. You're the one that created the
[18:00] heart. You're the one that created the
[18:02] body, Lord Jesus. And Father, when we
[18:04] come, oh God, with faith in our hearts,
[18:06] Lord, we know that everything is
[18:07] possible, oh Lord God. Because, Father,
[18:10] you said whatsoever we can believe for,
[18:12] we can have it, Lord. So, Father, we lay
[18:14] our hands by faith upon these requests,
[18:16] oh God, asking that you would you would
[18:18] touch this young lady, Lord. Father, if
[18:21] it be your will to go through this
[18:22] surgery, Lord, we pray you'd give the
[18:24] physicians, oh God, the wisdom, direct
[18:26] their hands, oh God. Father, may they be
[18:29] precise, Lord Jesus. And may this little
[18:31] one turn around to give glory to you,
[18:33] Lord. Father, for this family, Lord, who
[18:36] had the the vehicle on the side of the
[18:38] house, Lord Jesus, the husband, Father,
[18:41] the house is distraught. Father, you're
[18:43] the great comforter, oh God. Father, if
[18:46] he does not have the peace of Jesus
[18:47] Christ, we ask, oh God, that you would
[18:49] go to him where even now, Lord, that
[18:51] you, oh God, will supply his every need,
[18:54] Lord, you would keep him in composure,
[18:56] Lord. You will keep his mind, oh God, at
[18:58] peace. You keep his heart, oh God, at
[19:00] peace, Lord. But most of all, Lord, may
[19:03] he look up to you. May he, oh God,
[19:05] recognize that it's your grace, oh Lord,
[19:07] that has sustained him to this time,
[19:08] Lord. Father, Lord Jesus, for I believe
[19:12] um the brother, oh God, I don't remember
[19:16] the name just now, but God, I just all
[19:19] the needs, all the requests that were
[19:20] made, Lord, we we bring it before you,
[19:22] Lord Jesus.
[19:24] Father, it's upon my heart also to give
[19:26] thanksgiving to to you, Father, for
[19:28] Brother Ed's granddaughter, Lord, the
[19:30] special report that has come back, Lord.
[19:33] Father, I I rejoice, Lord, with with the
[19:35] brethren, oh God, that Father, you have
[19:37] found it in your heart, Lord, to touch
[19:39] this little one, Lord. Thank you for the
[19:42] doctor's report, Father. Thank you, dear
[19:44] God, for the faith of the believers,
[19:46] Lord, to continue to hold on. But,
[19:48] Father, it's in my heart, Lord, because
[19:50] the work is not completely done yet.
[19:53] Father, I want to see her, oh God,
[19:54] walking perfectly. I want to see her, oh
[19:57] God, free from every aid, Lord. But,
[19:59] Father, giving you praise, Lord, and
[20:01] rejoicing, Lord Jesus. That's my heart
[20:04] desire, Lord. And I make it known to you
[20:05] as I'm sure, oh God, is all of our
[20:07] hearts desires, Lord. Father, we have
[20:09] many things to be thankful for, oh God.
[20:12] Father, as the word of life would come
[20:14] even this morning, Lord Jesus. Father,
[20:16] there many in this congregation, Lord,
[20:18] who are not saved, Lord, many who might
[20:20] not be filled with the Holy Spirit,
[20:21] Lord. Many, oh God, who are here, Lord
[20:24] Jesus, or are not even here, Lord.
[20:26] Father, we pray that the bread of life
[20:28] will be broken to each member.
[20:30] That your Holy Spirit, oh God, would
[20:32] reach out, Lord, to each lost soul,
[20:34] Lord. And father in your own special way
[20:36] God that you would deliver that you
[20:44] power this morning
[20:47] &gt;&gt; God almighty that you deliver Lord
[20:53] [Music]
[20:55] &gt;&gt; have your own way
[20:58] &gt;&gt; God you said in your word
[21:00] &gt;&gt; that it's not your will that any should
[21:02] perish
[21:05] Lord.
[21:07] &gt;&gt; And oh God, I pray that you deliver this
[21:10] morning.
[21:18] &gt;&gt; Lord, I remember my brother Daniel.

[21:31] and your power.

[21:36] man, Lord,
[21:38] &gt;&gt; but I pray you would anoint the man
[21:40] behind this pulpit this morning.
[21:51] Hallelujah.
[21:54] &gt;&gt; God, it's a blessed time to walk with
[21:56] you, Lord.
[22:02] &gt;&gt; Pray you give the man of God the words
[22:04] to speak.
[22:06] &gt;&gt; He doesn't have to speak many words,
[22:08] God. But if he can only speak one,
[22:13] God, just the way you got a hold of my
[22:15] heart.
[22:20] She can only speak one word, God.
[22:26] &gt;&gt; Father, but I'm confident, Lord, that
[22:27] you do all things well.

[22:33] &gt;&gt; Thank you for all the families that are
[22:35] represented here. Oh God,

[22:44] request.
[22:46] And father, I don't know if we can speak
[22:48] it over the pulpit, Lord, but you've
[22:50] done it before, Lord.
[22:53] &gt;&gt; We pray, God, not.

[25:29] in your life.
[25:32] Reach out and pray.
[25:37] by those chains
[25:42] and they will fall

[27:45] &gt;&gt; May the church say, "Praise the Lord."
[27:47] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[27:48] &gt;&gt; Amen. God bless you this morning.
[27:53] &gt;&gt; God bless y'all. Um, I would just like
[27:55] to say it's been such a blessing to be
[27:57] here sojouring with you for a few weeks.
[27:59] Um, I felt such a welcoming spirit here
[28:01] and your many expressions of love and I
[28:05] want to thank everyone um, for making us
[28:07] feel so welcomed.
[28:09] Um, I would just like to give a little
[28:11] testimony before I sing this song if
[28:12] that's okay.
[28:14] Um, I was in a speech class in college,
[28:18] um, back in 2005 and we had an
[28:21] assignment to write a poem and
[28:24] I began writing the poem and I wrote the
[28:27] first four lines of it and um, I I
[28:30] wasn't serving the Lord at the time and
[28:33] I we were supposed to write a poem about
[28:36] something that really meant a lot to us
[28:38] and um, of course that was the Lord to
[28:40] me, you know, even though I wasn't I was
[28:42] running from
[28:43] Um, and so
[28:47] I'm sorry.
[28:49] Um, so I I began writing the poem. I
[28:52] wrote the first four lines and then I
[28:54] wasn't able to complete it because I
[28:55] wanted to end it on a positive note and
[28:57] I wasn't able to do that without having
[28:59] the experience of the Lord in my life.
[29:02] And so um, a couple months after that
[29:04] course,
[29:06] the Lord got a hold of my life. I
[29:08] finally surrendered. And uh and then
[29:10] about a year and a half after
[29:12] surrendering my life, I was praying one
[29:15] day. I had my my brother was very
[29:16] burdened on my heart and I began to pray
[29:19] for him and it was just such a special
[29:21] time of prayer. Uh I was just really
[29:24] beside myself and and it it was just
[29:27] such a blessing and it during prayer um
[29:32] the Lord spoke to me and said, "Get up
[29:34] and finish the poem." And I just thought
[29:37] it was a distracting thought and I kind
[29:39] of tossed it aside. I was just, you
[29:41] know, I just I was like, why would I
[29:43] have that thought while I'm while I'm
[29:44] sitting here praying, you know, but then
[29:46] the urge came on so strong and uh to to
[29:50] where I picked myself up and and I just
[29:52] went over to search for the beginning of
[29:54] the poem that I had started and um and
[29:57] the Lord just gave me the lines. It just
[29:59] flowed. He he just completed the whole
[30:01] thing. And and I'm just so thankful to
[30:04] have my brother here with me today. He's
[30:06] here visiting and it's just such a
[30:08] blessing. Um and so
[30:12] I also um am just very thankful um you
[30:16] know to be able to be here myself and
[30:17] and this poem that the Lord has given um
[30:22] he's been really dealing with me in song
[30:23] lately. So I'm going to try and sing it
[30:26] by the grace of God. So just please pray
[30:29] for me. God bless you all.
[30:33] [Music]
[30:51] There's a yearning
[30:54] deep down inside of my heart.
[31:01] Something is missing
[31:04] and I'm falling aart.
[31:08] The curtains are closing
[31:13] and the time is near.
[31:17] I should be rejoicing,
[31:21] but instead I'm in fear.
[31:25] I know there was a promise
[31:29] that was made long ago,
[31:33] but the cares of this world have brought
[31:38] me so low.
[31:41] I feel trapped down here now
[31:45] with no way to get out.
[31:50] If only I could understand
[31:54] what the cross is all about.
[31:58] A sense of urgency sweeps over me. And
[32:03] deaths at my door.
[32:07] Jesus Christ then comes to mind. And my
[32:11] knees soon hit the floor.
[32:15] In desperation
[32:17] I cry out. Sing. There's nothing I can
[32:22] do.
[32:24] He seems so distant from me. Will I be
[32:28] able to break through?
[32:31] I have heard about his love and how he
[32:36] sets the captive free.
[32:40] But all the sin that I live in, how
[32:44] could it be for me?
[32:48] And suddenly he reminds me and I begin
[32:54] to see.
[32:57] He paid the price so long ago on a hill
[33:01] called Calvary.
[33:04] I then ask him for forgiveness
[33:09] for all my unbelie.
[33:12] [Music]
[33:13] Just like a mighty rushing wind, he
[33:17] quickly sends relief.
[33:20] Something inside of me responds
[33:25] and reality sets in.
[33:30] I wasn't meant to live this life a slave
[33:33] in bondage to sin.
[33:37] I cannot begin to explain it. But her
[33:42] death has taken place.
[33:46] New life has sprung up in me. The joy is
[33:50] written all over my face.
[33:53] What seemed to be impossible
[33:57] has just been made so clear.
[34:02] All this time I have been running as he
[34:05] has tried to draw more near.
[34:10] This is just the beginning of our
[34:14] journey through this land. I am hanging
[34:18] on to his promise
[34:21] as we walk together hand in hand.
[34:25] I know I will make many mistakes and
[34:29] many times I will fall down,
[34:34] but by his grace I'll get back up. I'm
[34:37] predestined to receive a crown.
[34:41] I've been made an overcomer
[34:45] by his mercy and his grace.
[34:50] Thank God for authority to put the devil
[34:53] in his place.
[34:56] Satan has no more dominion over this
[35:01] tabernacle of clay.
[35:05] But my maker will attend it with care
[35:08] each and every day.
[35:12] I am thankful beyond words
[35:16] for the love he shares with me.
[35:21] I see him in my brothers and sisters
[35:24] which brings true unity.
[35:28] I am thankful for his keeping path which
[35:32] gives eternal security.
[35:36] I will praise his wonderful holy name
[35:40] throughout eternity.
[35:44] Yes, I will praise his wonderful holy
[35:48] name throughout eternity.
[35:51] [Music]
[36:02] Amen.
[36:05] &gt;&gt; Amen. We want to welcome I didn't catch
[36:07] your brother's name.
[36:09] &gt;&gt; Michael.
[36:10] &gt;&gt; Michael. God bless you, Michael. It's
[36:11] good to have you here. Let's give
[36:12] Michael a hand.
[36:14] [Music]
[36:17] Amen. Oh, it's good to be in the house
[36:20] of the Lord.
[36:21] &gt;&gt; It's good to hear the testimonies
[36:23] &gt;&gt; of the redeemed.
[36:25] &gt;&gt; Amen. And why don't we stand this
[36:26] morning? We'll give the Lord a hand clap
[36:28] of praise. He is worthy.
[36:32] Hallelujah.
[36:34] Hallelujah.
[36:37] Amen.
[36:40] Praise the Lord. Something's making me
[36:43] feel awful relaxed. I don't know what it
[36:44] is. Maybe you better turn around and
[36:45] shake hands with somebody. Tell them,
[36:47] "Welcome to the house of the Lord this
[36:49] morning."
[36:50] &gt;&gt; It's good to be in the presence of the
[36:51] Lord.
[36:52] &gt;&gt; Why don't we sing the word is working on
[36:54] me. Do you know that, Elena?
[36:56] We're going to invite our pastor to come
[36:59] take his liberty this morning. We have a
[37:01] communion service this evening,
[37:02] footwashing at 4:00.
[37:05] Remember that 4:00, we'll have communion
[37:07] footwashing. The service will start
[37:09] right away at 4:00. So, make sure that
[37:11] you're here and get a good seat this for
[37:15] this evening's service. Brother John
[37:16] will be ministering. I know it's going
[37:18] to be a wonderful day today. Amen. So,
[37:22] as our pastor comes, why don't we sing
[37:24] this together?
[37:26] The word is working mightily in me.
[37:32] The word is working mightily.
[37:35] Oh, in me. No matter what the
[37:39] circumstance or what I feel or see, the
[37:42] word is working mightily in me.
[37:47] The word is working.
[37:51] Praise God. The word is working finally.
[37:56] [Music]
[37:58] No matter what the circumstance or what
[38:01] I feel or see, the word is working
[38:05] finally in me. Well, the word is
[38:09] working.
[38:11] Oh, in me. The word is working
[38:16] in me.
[38:18] No matter what the circumstance,
[38:23] [Music]
[38:30] &gt;&gt; I agree.
[38:32] God bless you. Yeah. Just have your
[38:34] seats for uh a while, would you please?
[38:37] While I I have uh a number of important
[38:40] announcements to make and uh to speak
[38:44] with you about some of these things.
[38:46] very very happy for all that are here.
[38:50] all who are forming part of the
[38:52] congregation that we don't see the
[38:54] invisible congregation
[38:57] last Sunday I don't always check on this
[39:00] but last Sunday uh there was 177
[39:04] locations
[39:06] that were streaming and some of those
[39:09] are groups and some of those are
[39:11] families and some of those might be one
[39:14] but 177 locations so it' probably be
[39:18] somewhere around 400 people that are
[39:23] right today joining with you and many
[39:28] many have been streaming for years.
[39:33] They stream every service. And so we
[39:36] just want to say to them, God bless
[39:37] them. God bless you.
[39:39] &gt;&gt; And God bless us together.
[39:42] &gt;&gt; The Apostle Paul said, we're one bread.
[39:46] And so that's God's choosing.
[39:50] I have a number of announcements. So I
[39:52] just want to uh
[39:56] follow those closely. Uh the communion
[39:59] service which brother Derek has already
[40:02] announced at 4:00 this afternoon, but
[40:05] there are those from Seattle, Tacoma,
[40:08] and perhaps other places that have uh
[40:12] come to be with us today. And so I would
[40:14] just like to if you are here and you
[40:18] have driven h you are not going to be
[40:20] going home obviously and uh those on the
[40:24] US side uh those of you that are not
[40:26] going home and you are going to be
[40:29] remaining uh it won't be that long
[40:32] between the services but if you don't
[40:34] have a place to go and you're free this
[40:38] afternoon I'd like to know how many I'd
[40:41] like to see how many I say we're not
[40:43] going home and we're going to be
[40:45] remaining here uh until the afternoon
[40:49] service, but you don't have a place to
[40:51] go. I'd like to have you raise your hand
[40:54] so the rest of the congregation could
[40:56] see. Why don't you raise your hand? All
[40:58] right. Uh Sister Shannon and brother
[41:00] Terry Schmouth. Uh
[41:04] and over here, please just hold your
[41:06] hand up so everyone can see. All right,
[41:09] that's brother Matt Desmet
[41:14] upstairs
[41:16] balcony. My most of the people are taken
[41:19] care of.
[41:21] But you that are that are here and uh
[41:24] part of the congregation and are local,
[41:27] you you see these hands and those who
[41:30] are here, it would be just grand to
[41:33] invite them, have them over, put another
[41:36] cup of water in the soup.
[41:39] It'll still probably be nourishing or in
[41:42] the stew or whatever. You can always do
[41:46] some imaginative things. I read about uh
[41:51] a a young man in a Jewish family in New
[41:53] York and they were very very poor, very
[41:56] poor. And he wrote in his wasn't in his
[42:00] memoirs but in his articles cuz he was a
[42:03] journalist of some kind. And uh I
[42:06] thought it was so typical.
[42:09] It was uh just so typical. And so if
[42:12] they were having guests over, they
[42:14] didn't have enough food. Mother didn't
[42:16] have enough food. So, she'd say to the
[42:19] children, "Now, don't you dare uh don't
[42:22] you dare take vegetables because we
[42:25] haven't got enough to go around." So,
[42:27] the kids, they pass the vegetables up.
[42:29] "No, I don't want any. I don't want
[42:31] any." So, when it came to the dessert,
[42:33] she'd say, "Now, you kids didn't eat
[42:35] your vegetables, so you don't get any
[42:36] dessert."
[42:38] And that's how she made it enough to go
[42:40] around. So, whatever you folks have to
[42:43] do to make it go around, just make sure
[42:45] everybody here is welcome and has a and
[42:48] has a a place to go and put their feet
[42:50] up and have a bite to eat, and God will
[42:52] bless you. It's wonderful. It's really
[42:54] wonderful to be able to do that. Uh,
[42:57] this Friday, we're having also a prayer
[43:00] meeting, but we've been inviting the
[43:01] young people. Normally be a young
[43:04] people's meeting. It won't be a young
[43:05] people's meeting in that sense, but we
[43:08] want to be able to combine it. So, they
[43:11] are welcome. It'll be a prayer service.
[43:13] Brother Don Alexander, he takes charge
[43:15] of the prayer service, but we also will
[43:18] be h having perhaps a testimony and and
[43:21] we'll speak together about that, Brother
[43:23] Dawn. uh because we just want to make it
[43:26] so that uh families come and those of
[43:29] you that have come, we've heard such
[43:30] good reports and this last Friday we
[43:33] weren't able to be here uh to the
[43:35] service, but we heard some very
[43:38] wonderful reports from it. So, you are
[43:41] invited to that. Brother Derek spoke of
[43:44] the uh winter youth camp, but I want to
[43:47] just say a little bit more about it. You
[43:50] know, friends, these aren't just events.
[43:52] These are spiritual things, spiritual
[43:55] events. We're not doing it to have an
[43:57] event. We're not doing it for any
[43:59] entertainment. That's not why we put all
[44:02] this effort forward. We do that because
[44:05] some of you that are sitting here, God
[44:08] moved on you in a very real way in some
[44:12] of those meetings, camp meetings,
[44:14] wherever they were over the last 20 or
[44:16] 21 years. And we probably there's
[44:19] probably been maybe 200 or more that
[44:22] have been baptized as a result. And
[44:24] sometimes it's months later that a young
[44:27] person
[44:28] &gt;&gt; and believe me I believe in that.
[44:31] &gt;&gt; I was young once, believe it or not. And
[44:34] I remember clear crystal clear what God
[44:38] did for me as a youth. And I would not
[44:41] trade those moments for all the money or
[44:44] gold in the world. Those are eternal
[44:47] moments and we want to create that
[44:49] atmosphere. I think it's wonderful to be
[44:51] able to create an atmosphere and have a
[44:53] place where people's minds can be so
[44:56] solely on Christ and on eternal things.
[44:59] &gt;&gt; Do you agree with that?
[45:01] &gt;&gt; So that's what this is all about. The
[45:03] speaker will be brother Kedri Diggs.
[45:07] Brother Tom and he shared a a special
[45:11] meetings together. And so those that are
[45:14] streaming that this is your church and
[45:18] you pay tithes here. Some many people
[45:21] who are in the local area who may be in
[45:24] the Okonogan up in the uh valley down in
[45:27] the Tri Cities or over in Idaho. We had
[45:31] a phone call from uh uh uh sister
[45:36] uh brother Lane and Athena his wife and
[45:41] they wanted she just so urgent. I want
[45:44] my young people to be in that meeting
[45:47] and they stream all the time. They're
[45:48] part of the congregation by streaming.
[45:51] You don't see them but these eyes these
[45:54] eyes register very little compared to
[45:56] what God is doing.
[45:59] And so by all means we want to let them
[46:02] know that uh those are welcome to come
[46:06] and it'll be on a first come first serve
[46:08] basis however many were able to handle
[46:13] on in August first week of August is
[46:17] going to be a family camp and brother
[46:20] Ron Spencer will be the speaker
[46:24] &gt;&gt; and we're so happy that he was free and
[46:26] able to come and wanted to come.
[46:28] And I'm sure we want him to come. He and
[46:32] his wife, Sister Connie, we expect them
[46:34] to be here. And I asked him to try to
[46:37] persuade his father. We've tried to get
[46:39] Sister Conniey's father and mother to
[46:42] come. And if they are able to come at
[46:44] some time, uh you will you'll never
[46:48] forget them. I tell you that brother
[46:50] Frasier when the Lord made him, he threw
[46:53] the pattern past Pluto. I'm sure because
[46:57] you'll never never see another person
[46:59] quite like him. And uh brother Charlie
[47:03] Spencer, I don't know whether he and his
[47:04] wife can come, but brother Ron has asked
[47:07] us to pray especially for brother
[47:09] Frasier, sister Conniey's dad, because
[47:12] he's having he's had just had an
[47:15] operation on his sinuses and so on. And
[47:18] this man's a fighter. This man's a old
[47:21] warrior. I mean, he he fell out of a
[47:24] tree and broke up all the bones in his
[47:27] body. He's got more wires and rods in
[47:30] his back and all of these things. And
[47:32] they thought he'd never walk again. Hey,
[47:34] he's up doing everything that anyone
[47:37] else can do. And if you to see him walk
[47:39] in here, you wouldn't think anything's
[47:40] wrong with him. He just uh a real
[47:43] determined. I like to see people that
[47:45] are real fighters like that.
[47:48] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[47:50] And you don't have to be an older person
[47:52] to do that. Uh
[47:55] you might even want a pencil to jot some
[47:57] of these things down. Brother Richard
[47:59] Dioa uh he is emailed he was planning to
[48:03] be here in January. We sent invitations
[48:06] letter invitation letters so they get a
[48:08] visa and he wasn't able to come and the
[48:11] reason why he's not been able to come
[48:13] the first time he couldn't get a visa
[48:15] quick enough he wasn't able he had to go
[48:17] down to South Africa to get it the
[48:19] second time they have bought a a a piece
[48:23] of property that is five hectares now
[48:26] the place that they have right now I
[48:28] think is about seven hectares where they
[48:30] have Shikina publications and all the
[48:33] translation buildings and things and
[48:36] it's a it's a wonderful work just a
[48:38] wonderful work and uh we have been there
[48:41] on several occasions we were I was there
[48:45] for the dedication several were here
[48:47] from here were over there for the
[48:49] dedication of uh Shakina publications uh
[48:53] property and but they don't have a
[48:55] church the church is on our boulevard
[48:57] further into the city
[49:00] but it's too small and I've been there
[49:02] several times you don't even see the
[49:05] whole congregation. The church seats
[49:08] probably 8 to 10,000 people and they the
[49:13] last time we were there they tore the
[49:14] whole wall out and had about a thousand
[49:17] men working for a week tore the wall out
[49:20] and extended it by onethird and now it's
[49:24] too small. So, they have purchased this
[49:27] 5 hectare uh piece of property and have
[49:31] the materials to put up a steel
[49:33] building, but he's been very uh burdened
[49:36] with that. So, let's pray for him. He's
[49:39] a small man with a big heart and a big
[49:43] vision, and God has really used brother
[49:45] Dioa, and I I would like to just even
[49:49] just have him here to show friendship
[49:52] and to strengthen him. And let me tell
[49:55] you, we don't have enough time in the
[49:58] day to tell you how the enemy fights
[50:01] against a man like that.
[50:04] &gt;&gt; So, you're spiritual.
[50:07] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[50:08] &gt;&gt; You can just know that Satan has far
[50:12] more demon powers and spirits that's
[50:17] waring against him than he even has in
[50:19] his congregation.
[50:21] He's got he's got just hordes of spirits
[50:24] and demons that would fight him and
[50:27] every turn of the road. And it is the
[50:30] children of faith
[50:32] &gt;&gt; and the men of God
[50:34] &gt;&gt; that declare the word of God
[50:37] &gt;&gt; and and will absolutely will not bend
[50:41] &gt;&gt; to the enemy.
[50:42] &gt;&gt; And so we want to show our support. It's
[50:45] not a visit, friends. It's not just a
[50:47] somebody to come and visit and speak.
[50:49] That's not why he's he's coming. He just
[50:51] wants to be uh with you again and with
[50:54] the congregation and and uh perhaps
[50:57] speak of uh what God is doing out of out
[51:00] of his heart or in his heart. And I just
[51:03] say God bless our brother Dioa. And
[51:07] we're going to attempt to have him here
[51:09] in February. We sending just sent out
[51:11] invitational letters now.
[51:14] I've been in contact, direct contact
[51:17] with uh a brother in Haiti. He's he's an
[51:21] elder brother in the church that has
[51:23] 2,000 members.
[51:26] And uh he has told me now that of the
[51:30] number of people uh there was 12 in that
[51:33] congregation that lost their lives. And
[51:36] he just puts it different. He said uh
[51:38] now in the all the tally of the I think
[51:42] that not all the churches necessarily in
[51:43] Haiti because I haven't got uh contact
[51:46] with all of them but there's he said we
[51:49] have 18 believers that have gone to be
[51:52] with the Lord and uh uh so they're not
[51:55] sad about that but they just wanted us
[51:58] to know that they said that the
[52:00] immediate need was for food and for
[52:03] water and then uh brother John had uh
[52:07] sent this from taken from brother Pat's
[52:09] website but we also have had contact and
[52:13] uh brother Pati is over there
[52:17] and they have formed I'll just read a
[52:19] little bit of this they have formed a
[52:20] distribution committee with the pastors
[52:23] and leaders of the churches from Porta
[52:25] Prince and two other areas two other
[52:28] cities and there are uh 4,500
[52:33] brothers and sisters gathered in those
[52:35] three areas alone alone. And although
[52:38] the international help is now starting
[52:41] to be available, violence is all too
[52:44] often a part of it such that the
[52:47] brethren shy away from it. So the needs
[52:50] are so great that all the funds could be
[52:53] used up just in order to cover very
[52:56] basic food and water requirements. And
[52:59] incidentally, the church here and you
[53:01] people gave an offering. some that are
[53:04] streaming gave uh and sent offerings in
[53:07] and nice offerings. So, we have sent
[53:11] $8,000
[53:13] uh to brother Pat's account uh so that
[53:16] he could take those funds and have them
[53:18] down there to meet the immediate need.
[53:21] So this committee has they determined
[53:24] that they would take a first installment
[53:26] of uh $5700
[53:30] and buy uh by the immediate things that
[53:32] are essential to cover the essential
[53:35] needs
[53:37] and uh this was combined with
[53:40] Jeffersonville donations as well. People
[53:43] have given from all over. They even gave
[53:45] from Europe. And brother brother Pat
[53:48] very precise that he has an account and
[53:51] from that account is he's very
[53:53] accountable and food and and water are
[53:56] the first things and then they will have
[53:59] needs. I asked a brother about clothing
[54:02] in my email and he said we will need
[54:05] clothing because the people have lost
[54:08] everything everything. They don't have
[54:11] homes to go to. Many of them are living
[54:14] even at the church or in tents or just
[54:17] under tarps or whatever they have and
[54:20] they just have the clothing that they
[54:21] had on their backs. So, I'm not only
[54:25] asking this congregation, but those that
[54:27] are streaming and to tell anyone else uh
[54:30] if you wish to uh don't give parkas or
[54:35] wool garments, but this is a fairly hot
[54:38] climate, but you could bring uh
[54:41] appropriate clothing. I've spoken with
[54:43] brother Richard Drake and uh although he
[54:47] cannot do the work so I'm I'll come to a
[54:50] second part of that but he will be the
[54:52] point man and uh uh what we want to do
[54:56] is be able to collect clothing and be
[55:00] able to send it to those people. So we
[55:02] will need secondly we'll need workers
[55:05] and those that are able or would like to
[55:08] put in a little bit of time or just help
[55:10] in some way not necessarily in this but
[55:14] uh there may be sisters there may be
[55:16] brothers and I would like to just say
[55:18] something to you'll never regret making
[55:22] yourself available
[55:24] &gt;&gt; for service to the bride of Jesus Christ
[55:28] &gt;&gt; in whatever way and start young
[55:32] Start young. I was peeling logs for a
[55:35] church at about 16 years old. And do you
[55:39] think I regret that? Not for a second.
[55:42] &gt;&gt; I would clean that church when I was
[55:44] about 18 and already felt a call for the
[55:46] ministry. I wasn't trying to get
[55:49] somebody to open up a pulpit. I just
[55:51] wanted to work for God.
[55:53] &gt;&gt; I don't care whether I'm cleaning the
[55:54] church or whether I'm uh playing the
[55:57] guitar or whether I'm singing or
[56:00] whatever it is. just want to bless the
[56:02] people.
[56:03] &gt;&gt; And that's what God appreciates and just
[56:06] use my energy, use your strength, use
[56:09] your resources.
[56:10] &gt;&gt; I can tell you. And brother Brandham
[56:12] said about uh he said about building a
[56:15] church, which I'll come to in just a
[56:17] moment. He says, "If you're building a
[56:18] house, put it on up." Because he was
[56:20] asked about the coming of the Lord and
[56:22] and what they should be doing. If you're
[56:24] building a house, put it on up. If Jesus
[56:27] comes tomorrow, you'd be found faithful
[56:30] at the duty. If you're building your
[56:32] church, go on, put it up. I'd rather be
[56:35] putting my money in something like that
[56:37] than be found with it in my pocket. So,
[56:40] just keep on continue as you are. And
[56:42] so, whatever we're doing towards the
[56:45] Lord's work, your life is an expression.
[56:48] And uh uh you know, you have to help me
[56:51] so I won't go too far with this, but
[56:53] this is all announcements. That's part
[56:55] of it. And I I feel very very urgent
[56:58] today. Whatever a person does, if you're
[57:01] working at the at the camp for the young
[57:03] people, it's not the camp, it's the
[57:05] young people. It's God's people. It's
[57:07] God's children. And you have to think of
[57:09] it in terms of I'm helping, I'm
[57:11] assisting to create an atmosphere to be
[57:14] here for our children. And I work for
[57:17] our children like they're my own
[57:19] children, like they're my own teenagers
[57:21] and my own kids. I just love them. And I
[57:25] think we ought to all feel that way.
[57:27] They don't have to be part of your
[57:28] family. I think it's just wonderful.
[57:30] We've got these little ones that come
[57:32] around here and I always shake their
[57:34] hand and they're always find me in the
[57:36] foyer and they're, you know, they're
[57:38] coming. They don't want their parents
[57:39] even to drag them past. They want to be
[57:41] sure and shake hand. And I always want
[57:43] to make sure I shake hand with them,
[57:45] too. I think that's wonderful.
[57:47] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[57:49] &gt;&gt; Also, uh
[57:52] so that is about Haiti.
[57:55] And now I want to uh make announcement
[57:58] for the Switzerland Easter convention.
[58:02] Not that it has such a great bearing
[58:04] here, but it does for you to be praying
[58:06] for it. And that is going to be on April
[58:09] the 2nd, 3rd, 4th, and 5th.
[58:13] and it is at the campus
[58:16] uh of uh Cersei Convention Center and uh
[58:20] brother Murphy Wong will be uh there as
[58:24] well speaking along with myself
[58:28] uh brother Frank Kronite had planned to
[58:32] be there and he is uh having he's had to
[58:35] work during this time so he's not able
[58:38] to be there but uh pastors brother
[58:40] Fransis Lipacar who was here and also
[58:44] brother Jeanjax Gerard. Uh there there
[58:48] are two brothers, two pastors that are
[58:50] cooperating and participating in the
[58:53] meetings. There'll be other ministers
[58:55] from Europe that are expected to be in
[58:57] attendance. And also I want to uh
[59:01] especially for those that are streaming
[59:03] from Europe, whether in Holland or
[59:05] Belgium or Germany or Switzerland, we
[59:09] want to be sure that you know that you
[59:12] are invited to be a part of these
[59:14] meetings. And we have on the screen the
[59:17] address and the uh phone numbers that
[59:20] you can call uh brother David Meyer or
[59:24] brother Daniel Culenbrunner and uh you
[59:27] can call the numbers that are on the
[59:29] screen and they will be able to give you
[59:32] further information regarding those
[59:34] meetings. There's going to be several
[59:36] that are coming from here. Uh brother
[59:38] Kim and sister Hedi Dingwall plan to go.
[59:42] Uh there's about uh 12 or more from from
[59:45] the church here that are planning to go
[59:48] to attend these meetings. Brother Murphy
[59:50] will be going uh further. He will be
[59:54] going to brother Gear Rotos. I spoke
[59:56] with brother Garrett Rotoald also this
[59:58] last week and we were I was I and my
[1:00:01] wife were supposed to go too but we just
[1:00:02] feel we won't do that. And uh then
[1:00:06] brother he's arranging also in the week
[1:00:10] for brother uh Murphy. So pray for him.
[1:00:13] And sister Tracy may be going as well.
[1:00:15] They're going to be at brother Rodwell's
[1:00:18] and perhaps brother Hank Dystra and up
[1:00:20] in Holland has asked for brother Murphy
[1:00:23] to come by could go to uh near Crayfeld
[1:00:27] Doozeldorf area where uh I was there
[1:00:30] last year with brother Murphy as well
[1:00:32] and I met him and heard him speak. And
[1:00:35] so uh you see these people friends you
[1:00:38] know you have the opportunity of hearing
[1:00:41] firsthand
[1:00:43] uh these people but there are people
[1:00:46] that go year in and year out and never
[1:00:48] hear and so I trust that you appreciate
[1:00:52] I mean people give all their almost give
[1:00:54] their eye it teeth to hear somebody that
[1:00:57] just returned from as we did on
[1:00:59] Wednesday night brother Timothy M from
[1:01:01] about two and a half months from
[1:01:03] Vietnam. Who else do you know who's been
[1:01:05] in Vietnam for two and a half months?
[1:01:07] Who else do you know who's who's maybe
[1:01:09] baptized 150 people in Vietnam? I say
[1:01:12] thank God we can be a part of that.
[1:01:15] Thank God we can even as support and say
[1:01:18] amen.
[1:01:19] &gt;&gt; God bless you, brother. How many enjoyed
[1:01:21] brother Timothy on Wednesday night? It
[1:01:23] was wonderful. Just wonderful. I should
[1:01:26] say so.
[1:01:29] And brother Murphy having been up in the
[1:01:31] interior. I've been to China several
[1:01:33] times, but I can't go where he goes.
[1:01:36] Brother Brandon was aware of that. He
[1:01:37] says the the native of the country, he's
[1:01:39] the one that can really go there and he
[1:01:41] can get to these distant places. So,
[1:01:44] we're we're looking forward to a
[1:01:46] gracious time there. And then on April
[1:01:49] the 29th through May the 2nd is going to
[1:01:53] be a dedication of the church in Moscow.
[1:01:56] I've given little tidbits of but I just
[1:01:59] decided to take time with the meeting
[1:02:00] this morning. The church in Moscow is uh
[1:02:04] is a there was three groups uh three
[1:02:08] small groups and they're gathering in
[1:02:10] different parts of the city.
[1:02:12] Incidentally, Moscow is a city of just
[1:02:14] under 12 million people. That's
[1:02:17] according to census 12 million and one
[1:02:20] of the most expensive cities in the
[1:02:22] world. Far more. You think things are
[1:02:24] expensive here? How do you like to spend
[1:02:26] several thousand US dollars a month for
[1:02:29] a condominium rent?
[1:02:33] They do. You say, "How do they live?"
[1:02:36] Well, you just have to get uh accustomed
[1:02:40] to some of these things. So, these three
[1:02:43] groups, one of them was meeting or maybe
[1:02:44] they were two of them, I don't know, but
[1:02:46] they're meeting a little storefront,
[1:02:48] some kind of commercial place, and they
[1:02:50] lost they weren't able to use that
[1:02:52] anymore. and shifted from here to there.
[1:02:55] And they and the people, you know, with
[1:02:58] the they're just peasants and poor
[1:03:00] people and maybe some are businessmen,
[1:03:03] but they put together $80,000 US over
[1:03:06] the years. They saved and scrimped and
[1:03:08] saved $80,000 and they bought a piece of
[1:03:12] land, but they could go no further.
[1:03:15] That's as far as they could go. and
[1:03:17] brother Sergey and brother Garrett Roal.
[1:03:21] Brother Sergey is brother was brother
[1:03:23] Rodal's right-hand man and he actually
[1:03:27] was in like down in Pakistan or
[1:03:29] Usbekiststan or one of those countries
[1:03:32] in the southern which was a former
[1:03:34] Soviet Union and one of the states and
[1:03:37] brother Sergey is a young man probably
[1:03:40] in his late teens or early 20s. He
[1:03:43] witnessed this message and there was
[1:03:45] some people that came in and a church
[1:03:48] was formed out of that. And so God I
[1:03:51] mean this just what happened. And then
[1:03:53] he moves to Germany and he marries a
[1:03:55] German girl and ends up in brother G
[1:03:58] Roal's church and what is isn't God full
[1:04:02] of accidents? No. It's all a plan.
[1:04:06] &gt;&gt; And here what does brother Roto needs?
[1:04:08] He needs an interpreter. He needs a
[1:04:10] translator in the Russian language. And
[1:04:12] God provides one and sticks it right in
[1:04:14] his office.
[1:04:17] &gt;&gt; Thanks, brother John.
[1:04:19] &gt;&gt; I want you people to get electrified
[1:04:21] with this.
[1:04:23] &gt;&gt; Isn't that wonderful the way God works?
[1:04:26] &gt;&gt; He just brings the right person, brings
[1:04:28] them right in, sets him right in the
[1:04:29] office. So, he became brother Gerro's
[1:04:32] right-hand man. And then the church, the
[1:04:36] three groups came together in Moscow and
[1:04:38] they they called for brother Sergey and
[1:04:41] had to come up and minister and he would
[1:04:43] go out and minister and they said, "We
[1:04:45] want you to be our pastor." Oh, brother
[1:04:48] Ger Rotoald really had to go to prayer
[1:04:50] over that one. And he he he let him go
[1:04:53] just very reluctantly, you know, but now
[1:04:56] he's already up there. But in order for
[1:04:58] them to get there, I'm just telling you
[1:05:00] now what we've been through over the
[1:05:02] last months. In order for him to move
[1:05:05] there, they had to have a place. His
[1:05:07] wife naturally, they have four children
[1:05:10] and one was just a little infant in arms
[1:05:13] and she wasn't really anxious to pick up
[1:05:15] and move from her native country and
[1:05:18] move into Russia and had no place to
[1:05:21] live. And an apartment is so costly they
[1:05:25] couldn't even begin to afford it. So the
[1:05:27] only thing to do was to put up a
[1:05:29] building of some sort on this piece of
[1:05:32] land. And the people just said, you
[1:05:35] know, put up in the first place that we
[1:05:37] should finish as a place for the pastor
[1:05:39] to live. And I thought that was
[1:05:41] wonderful for the people and so
[1:05:43] different, you know, they got architects
[1:05:45] and all the rest of it and a a builder
[1:05:47] brother from Ria Latvia. He's a pastor
[1:05:50] of a church there. And uh uh
[1:05:55] oh my goodness, there's just so much. I
[1:05:57] mean, my mind is just racing. Uh if I
[1:06:01] just begin to tell you, you know, even
[1:06:03] this brother's from Latvia, he's the son
[1:06:05] of the old man that we visited in 1990
[1:06:09] that saw a vision of brother Brham and
[1:06:12] told his people. And in this vision, he
[1:06:15] saw a man riding a horse and a voice
[1:06:17] spoke to him and said, "That man can
[1:06:20] tell you what you need to know."
[1:06:23] And later
[1:06:25] he saw the name on a book and uh in a
[1:06:28] Russian language and told the people,
[1:06:30] "This is the man." It was brother
[1:06:31] Brandham's name.
[1:06:33] &gt;&gt; How do you like that? And he sat right
[1:06:36] beside the pullpit here in a little
[1:06:38] chair at 80ome years old and just stared
[1:06:41] down into the people while I was able to
[1:06:43] stand behind the pulpit and said, "Your
[1:06:46] pastor saw a vision of the man who I was
[1:06:52] with
[1:06:53] and now I will stand here as a living
[1:06:55] witness to his vision."
[1:06:59] &gt;&gt; You think that didn't have some effect?
[1:07:01] And that and out of that church came the
[1:07:04] people that is the believer's work in
[1:07:07] that area right now. And I'll never
[1:07:10] forget and the brother who's in charge
[1:07:12] of that work, he's a monster of a man
[1:07:15] driving us back to where the city, which
[1:07:18] we shouldn't have left at that time. And
[1:07:21] we left, you know, kind of secretly and
[1:07:24] had because you're not supposed to leave
[1:07:25] from the city, but we went, we had to go
[1:07:27] to these churches. And uh so we're
[1:07:29] driving past and I'm looking at this car
[1:07:32] and uh this great massive Russian man
[1:07:35] and he's just hunkered over this
[1:07:38] steering wheel and driving this car back
[1:07:40] to this city. And I'm I said
[1:07:45] uh
[1:07:47] what's make is this car?
[1:07:50] He says I made it.
[1:07:53] So that's the car we were driving in and
[1:07:56] he's looking after this work now. Well,
[1:07:58] it is it is that the pastor that old
[1:08:01] pastor his son who's now a man probably
[1:08:05] 50 60 years old. He's a pastor in in
[1:08:08] Latvia
[1:08:10] in Ria Latvia. And he went down to
[1:08:14] Russia to see this church that they were
[1:08:16] planning to build. And he said, "No,
[1:08:18] this isn't the way you do it. you need
[1:08:20] to put a second floor on it and it won't
[1:08:22] cost anymore because they had a real
[1:08:24] nice roof. Take that roof off and just
[1:08:26] raise it up and and he doubled the space
[1:08:30] for just a few more loads of concrete
[1:08:32] blocks. And so they wrote here and said,
[1:08:35] "If we just can get 16 more loads of
[1:08:37] concrete blocks or something, we can
[1:08:39] have a whole second floor." And and so
[1:08:42] anyway, make a long story short, the
[1:08:45] pastor has moved and he's in the he's
[1:08:48] now got his quarters finished and they
[1:08:51] have a they have a the sanctuary is
[1:08:54] pretty primitive, but they that's why we
[1:08:57] sent some more funds just recently in
[1:08:59] December, I think it was. And so the
[1:09:02] churches in in Europe and church here
[1:09:05] and and the believers that are sent
[1:09:09] through Bible believers and so on, we've
[1:09:11] been able to send them something over
[1:09:13] $100,000.
[1:09:14] And so this will be the dedication of
[1:09:16] this church. Uh
[1:09:19] brother uh I will be attending along
[1:09:22] with brother Garrett Rodald to share in
[1:09:25] the meetings. Uh the pastor's name is
[1:09:28] brother Sergey Vulov and I I spoke to
[1:09:32] brother Peter Iban from Tacoma and his
[1:09:36] passport has expired and I have to send
[1:09:40] it to Russia to get it renewed. So I
[1:09:44] believe brother Peter is here. Are you
[1:09:45] here in the service, brother Peter? Yes.
[1:09:49] All right. And anyway, I sent an email,
[1:09:52] which I didn't get an answer to yet, and
[1:09:54] said, "Don't let them send it by mail,
[1:09:58] send it by FedEx,
[1:10:00] send it by DHL or something so he can
[1:10:04] get it back a little faster because I
[1:10:06] sure want to see him to be able to
[1:10:09] attend those meetings." And uh, Brother
[1:10:13] Kim Dingwall will be there. Brother
[1:10:15] Randy Snow is planning to go. Brother
[1:10:17] Milco and two brothers from the US plan
[1:10:20] to meet us in New York. And I just
[1:10:22] learned this morning that brother
[1:10:23] Richard is going with his his son Levi,
[1:10:27] I believe, also. So we will have not
[1:10:30] only good representation from here, but
[1:10:33] uh uh it will be a great encouragement
[1:10:35] to them over there.
[1:10:39] All right, you still with me?
[1:10:40] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:10:41] &gt;&gt; Good. Good. We want to remember
[1:10:46] also this morning, we don't want to uh
[1:10:48] there isn't a whole lot to say. Brother
[1:10:50] Billy Paul uh had some test, but he said
[1:10:54] he's all right. Brother Randy Snow was
[1:10:57] speaking uh to Brother Billy and uh
[1:11:01] because they know each other very well
[1:11:03] and he said he had those tests, some
[1:11:05] tests just recently, this last week, but
[1:11:08] he said he's feeling real fine. Now, we
[1:11:10] want to have prayer. You've already
[1:11:12] prayed this morning. I'm conscious of
[1:11:13] our time. We've been quite a while. But
[1:11:16] we have brother Kim is in India right
[1:11:18] now. And I've got to say, can I take a
[1:11:21] few minutes?
[1:11:21] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:11:23] &gt;&gt; We've been in India now this year 30
[1:11:25] years.
[1:11:28] Do I hear something more than silence?
[1:11:31] &gt;&gt; Isn't that wonderful? Amen.
[1:11:33] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:11:34] &gt;&gt; And from the first month, we have never
[1:11:37] missed a month printing the messages in
[1:11:41] the prophet's language.
[1:11:45] &gt;&gt; That printing press and the printing
[1:11:47] presses have never printed one of my
[1:11:50] messages.
[1:11:52] &gt;&gt; That's not what's important. They've
[1:11:54] printed the prophet's message every
[1:11:57] month and have gone from one language
[1:12:00] now to 11 languages. I believe it is.
[1:12:03] And God has given very very faithful
[1:12:05] people over there. Brother D brother uh
[1:12:09] brother Dr. Jacobs and he's passed away
[1:12:11] and gone to be with the Lord now. But he
[1:12:14] was the right man to get it all up and
[1:12:16] running and established. The work there
[1:12:18] has had as many as 15 full-time staff
[1:12:22] and was a heavy financial burden. But
[1:12:24] people gave. I tell you what, people
[1:12:27] gave. a woman that has never been there.
[1:12:30] A woman a very very dear friend of I and
[1:12:32] my wife and she's now gone on to be with
[1:12:35] the Lord herself.
[1:12:37] She had she cared for as many as a
[1:12:40] hundred young people, not at once, but
[1:12:43] they've gone through her home. She had
[1:12:46] no husband all the years that I've known
[1:12:48] her. And she had as many as a hundred
[1:12:51] mentally challenged
[1:12:54] young people and children and young
[1:12:56] people in her home and she cared for
[1:12:59] them so that she could have the funds
[1:13:02] and send them to Bible believers
[1:13:06] to support the work in India. And
[1:13:09] besides that, she raised canaries,
[1:13:13] little song birds, and she raised them
[1:13:16] and sold them and would send
[1:13:20] probably most every year somewhere
[1:13:22] between 2,000 and 2500. I'm not taking
[1:13:25] up an offering. I'm telling what people
[1:13:27] have done.
[1:13:28] &gt;&gt; I'm telling you what they've done. If a
[1:13:30] person has the will, you'll find a way.
[1:13:32] And not everybody has the same burden.
[1:13:34] But they were burdened for India before
[1:13:36] they even came to the message. They were
[1:13:38] burdened while they were still in
[1:13:40] Pentecost. When they came into the
[1:13:42] message, praise God,
[1:13:44] &gt;&gt; we can we now know what we're that what
[1:13:48] we're doing and why we're doing it.
[1:13:50] &gt;&gt; Listen, friends, don't be satisfied with
[1:13:53] uh with what we have here. And we're in
[1:13:56] a land of plenty. It could just
[1:13:58] disappear like that. Amen.
[1:14:00] &gt;&gt; It could just disappear like uh like
[1:14:02] what's happened in Haiti. It could just
[1:14:05] disappear like it's going to happen in
[1:14:07] Los Angeles.
[1:14:09] &gt;&gt; It's going to be gone.
[1:14:10] &gt;&gt; The good life is going to be gone. And I
[1:14:13] can tell you when that happens, banks
[1:14:15] will fail.
[1:14:17] &gt;&gt; Insurance companies will disappear
[1:14:20] because they won't be able to support
[1:14:21] that. The whole lifestyle of this grand
[1:14:24] North America, Canada as well, going to
[1:14:27] slide right down the tube. and I'm going
[1:14:29] to not slide with it. I'm going to
[1:14:31] ascend and go up.
[1:14:33] &gt;&gt; That's the promise that God's given us.
[1:14:35] This message that we've gathered around
[1:14:37] sitting here today has said, "Thus
[1:14:40] sayaith the Lord, it's going to slide
[1:14:42] into the ocean
[1:14:44] &gt;&gt; and the ocean will weep its way into the
[1:14:47] desert."
[1:14:48] &gt;&gt; And that's thus sayith the Lord.
[1:14:50] &gt;&gt; And that's the message that we're
[1:14:51] around. Whether it happens today,
[1:14:54] tomorrow, or a year from now, or 10
[1:14:56] years from now, it's irrelevant with me.
[1:14:58] It's going to happen.
[1:15:00] &gt;&gt; Like I had a Pentecostal pastor's wife
[1:15:03] who nibbled on this message. They knew
[1:15:06] us, I and my wife, they knew us so so
[1:15:08] well. And this p this pastor's wife was
[1:15:12] a pianist for us when we first began to
[1:15:15] pastor up in Dawson Creek. And they just
[1:15:18] couldn't. They wanted they wanted
[1:15:20] something out of the uh to be respected.
[1:15:23] Excuse me, musicians for a moment. But
[1:15:26] they wanted to be respected and they
[1:15:27] couldn't let go of wanting to be a wee
[1:15:30] bit popular and recognize they could not
[1:15:32] let go of that and take a hold of the
[1:15:35] message. But a earthquake took place at
[1:15:39] uh right while a ball game was t
[1:15:41] happening I think at Candle Park in LA
[1:15:44] in in San Francisco and shook and the
[1:15:47] highway overpasses fell down. How many
[1:15:50] remember that?
[1:15:51] &gt;&gt; Quite a number of you remember that
[1:15:53] right while a ball game was happening
[1:15:55] and I heard a news reporter says
[1:15:58] somebody
[1:16:01] trying to tell us something.
[1:16:03] And I say, you know, something was
[1:16:05] speaking to him and and I don't know how
[1:16:08] many people lost their lives, but the
[1:16:11] first thing that happened is I got a
[1:16:13] phone call right away from this pastor's
[1:16:15] wife who could not accept the message,
[1:16:17] but soon as the earthquake happened,
[1:16:19] she's on the phone. She asked me, she
[1:16:21] said, "What did Brother Brandham say
[1:16:23] about the earthquake in California?" And
[1:16:25] somebody was saying that there he said
[1:16:27] that there's going to be three. Hey,
[1:16:29] it's already too late. If you're going
[1:16:31] to wait till after the fact, it's
[1:16:34] already too late. So, well, I'll find
[1:16:36] out then. No, it's already too late.
[1:16:42] &gt;&gt; We know now. We've been told now. We've
[1:16:45] been warned now. We've been instructed
[1:16:46] now. And so, we don't have to wait for
[1:16:49] that to take place.
[1:16:53] &gt;&gt; So, I thank God. and and and now in in
[1:16:56] India,
[1:16:58] Brother Kim sent a wonderful wonderful
[1:17:00] report and and advanced things much much
[1:17:03] further than I thought could be done
[1:17:05] just in a few days. He's only been there
[1:17:08] two three days. He's been with brother
[1:17:10] Moses. This is what I need you to pray
[1:17:13] about.
[1:17:14] We have had for about a year, a year and
[1:17:17] a half uh all in the works to change the
[1:17:21] work in India dramatically
[1:17:23] because today technology will allow that
[1:17:27] we can do do better with less people in
[1:17:32] a smaller location. We've got a large
[1:17:34] three-story building which was built
[1:17:36] there for this work for the William
[1:17:38] Brandham Good News Society. And now we
[1:17:42] need to move that to a much smaller
[1:17:45] place much uh much tighter uh uh uh unit
[1:17:51] and it's going to be a large digital
[1:17:54] printing unit so that a pastor could
[1:17:57] call and simply say I need 200 of this
[1:18:00] title now with the hub it ties in with
[1:18:02] the hub and it's going to be a regional
[1:18:05] distribution area instead of this big
[1:18:07] building three stories we got one whole
[1:18:10] floor of inventory of books because if
[1:18:14] you start fire up that big press, you
[1:18:17] need to keep it running in order to
[1:18:20] print enough so that you'll have a few
[1:18:22] thousand left over for churches that
[1:18:24] come and believers that come for the
[1:18:27] next year or two because you're not
[1:18:28] going to print those again. But now
[1:18:30] that's not the case anymore. And so you
[1:18:33] just work from a much smaller press. So
[1:18:36] the all the equipment this big press and
[1:18:39] so on which was bought from Nova Scotia
[1:18:42] that all that press and that equipment
[1:18:44] will be sold
[1:18:46] we don't need the packing people because
[1:18:49] now it's just on demand and that to me
[1:18:52] I'm so enthused and so happy about it
[1:18:54] you know listen friends I don't have
[1:18:56] relatives in India I don't have any
[1:18:58] emotional ties there but God opened a
[1:19:01] door there and I thank God for it I want
[1:19:04] to be able to stand before the Lord
[1:19:05] Jesus and say, "Well, we did what we
[1:19:07] could and I spoke to the people and we
[1:19:10] spoke to the world and spoke about it in
[1:19:13] conventions and did we did what we
[1:19:15] could.
[1:19:16] &gt;&gt; We got the word out as we could." And
[1:19:18] how many here have how many here have
[1:19:20] been blessed by reading a message.
[1:19:24] &gt;&gt; Absolutely.
[1:19:30] &gt;&gt; Have to forgive me. And so that's what's
[1:19:33] happening right now. And we just wanted
[1:19:35] the people in India. And here God put it
[1:19:37] in their hearts and they went right
[1:19:40] moved right into it. And this is what
[1:19:41] brother uh Kim has been doing in India.
[1:19:45] Brother Victor Adamora is still in
[1:19:47] Nigeria and will be until March. And so
[1:19:50] we want to pray for them. Uh but this is
[1:19:54] this is the plan. Brother Tony has sent
[1:19:56] an email and I'm sure many here received
[1:19:59] it as well that that some uh believers
[1:20:02] or Christians in Iran. I don't know
[1:20:05] them. Does uh do you know brother
[1:20:07] Matthew knew those people? Sister
[1:20:10] Geneva.
[1:20:12] They're in Iran. I don't know if you
[1:20:13] heard about it, but uh I I'm sure that
[1:20:16] because those are the contacts brother
[1:20:18] Tony actually got I think from brother
[1:20:20] Matthew. And so we want to remember
[1:20:22] them. They're under a death threat right
[1:20:24] now.
[1:20:25] All right, I'll have you stand.
[1:20:29] It's not the usual I take this much
[1:20:31] time, but I would like to
[1:20:35] uh
[1:20:41] Okay.
[1:20:43] Yeah, I made I made an error, but
[1:20:45] brother brother Jean Jax I said Gerard
[1:20:49] actually is brother Michel. I'm sorry.
[1:20:52] Brother Jean Jax Michel. So you'll
[1:20:54] forgive me, brother Jean Jax, when you
[1:20:56] hear this. All right, we want to have
[1:20:58] prayer and remember these requests. Will
[1:21:01] you join with me? I wonder if we could
[1:21:03] just sing, have faith in God. Have faith
[1:21:06] in God for the answer. Will you pick it
[1:21:08] up for me?
[1:21:10] [Music]
[1:21:13] &gt;&gt; Faith
[1:21:15] in God.
[1:21:18] [Music]
[1:21:21] Have
[1:21:24] faith
[1:21:25] in God.
[1:21:32] Have
[1:21:34] faith
[1:21:36] in God for the answer.
[1:21:41] Have faith
[1:21:44] in
[1:21:46] God.
[1:21:49] Dear heavenly father, we're coming to
[1:21:51] you because we do have faith in God, the
[1:21:54] living God, the only true living God.
[1:21:58] You are the God that Abraham worshiped,
[1:22:02] the God of Abraham. You're the God that
[1:22:04] Isaac worshiped, the God of Isaac.
[1:22:07] You're the God that Jacob worshiped and
[1:22:10] the prophets of the Old Testament, the
[1:22:13] seers and the sages, the patriarchs.
[1:22:16] You're the God of the apostles. You're
[1:22:19] the God and father of our Lord Jesus
[1:22:21] Christ that sent him for to be a
[1:22:23] substitute for us. You're my substitute,
[1:22:25] Lord Jesus. And today in your name, we
[1:22:28] come and we ask that your name will be
[1:22:30] lifted up and glorified in this service.
[1:22:33] We pray that you will bless the people
[1:22:34] that we have spoken of. Whether it be in
[1:22:37] Switzerland, whether it be in Russia,
[1:22:39] whether it be in China or Vietnam or
[1:22:42] India, we pray that you will bless the
[1:22:44] believers. Oh God, the bride of Jesus
[1:22:47] Christ around this globe. It is your
[1:22:50] inheritance. How we were speaking of it
[1:22:52] this morning, Lord. This is what you
[1:22:54] have on the earth. This is your family.
[1:22:57] These are your children, oh God. Bless
[1:23:00] brother Kim. Give him wisdom, strength,
[1:23:02] and courage. I pray watch over him,
[1:23:04] Lord. our brother Victor Adam Moore. Oh
[1:23:06] God, as he moves around amongst the
[1:23:09] people, I pray you'll you will be
[1:23:12] mindful, oh God, and give him the kind
[1:23:14] of wisdom he needs, words that will come
[1:23:16] to him, Lord, at the right moment. And I
[1:23:19] pray you'll bless our brother Dio, oh
[1:23:21] God, under a great strain at this time.
[1:23:24] He's bearing a great burden. We remember
[1:23:26] when Moses was so burdened with such a
[1:23:29] great burden of such a multitude of
[1:23:31] people. I pray you'll strengthen our
[1:23:33] little brother's body, oh God. That you
[1:23:35] will encourage him and infuse him,
[1:23:37] Father, with wisdom from above. May the
[1:23:40] Holy Ghost prepare the way ahead and
[1:23:44] provide for them, Lord, as they have
[1:23:46] need. And now for this morning, we have
[1:23:48] need, Lord. I have need. I'm so
[1:23:51] depending upon you. I'm praying that the
[1:23:53] word will have entrance into the hearts
[1:23:56] of the people. Cause them to be
[1:23:58] receptive, oh Lord. cause them to be in
[1:24:00] expectation. Father, in the name of
[1:24:03] Jesus Christ, bless your word now as it
[1:24:06] goes forth, I pray, amen.
[1:24:08] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:24:09] &gt;&gt; And everybody said,
[1:24:10] &gt;&gt; "Amen." Thank you. Open your Bibles if
[1:24:13] you would. Thank you for musicians for
[1:24:16] staying so long. Now, I want to read out
[1:24:19] of Luke's gospel. Going to move along as
[1:24:22] quickly as I can.
[1:24:24] uh the fourth chapter
[1:24:28] reading a
[1:24:31] from the 16th to the 21st verse.
[1:24:37] And he came to Nazareth where he had
[1:24:39] been brought up. And as his custom was,
[1:24:42] he went into the synagogue on the
[1:24:44] Sabbath day and stood up for to read.
[1:24:47] And there was delivered unto him the
[1:24:49] book of the prophet Isaiah. And when he
[1:24:51] had opened the book, he found the place
[1:24:54] where it was written. That's one of the
[1:24:55] most marvelous
[1:24:58] statements in the Bible for me. He found
[1:25:02] he found the place where it was written.
[1:25:06] In other words, he found the place of
[1:25:08] the promise for that very moment.
[1:25:11] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen.
[1:25:12] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:25:13] &gt;&gt; The spirit of the Lord
[1:25:16] &gt;&gt; is upon me because he hath anointed me
[1:25:19] to preach the gospel to the poor. Can we
[1:25:22] say praise the Lord?
[1:25:23] &gt;&gt; He hath sent me to heal the
[1:25:25] brokenhearted. Can the brokenhearted
[1:25:27] say, "Praise the Lord."
[1:25:29] &gt;&gt; To preach deliverance to the captives.
[1:25:32] We can say, "Praise the Lord." And
[1:25:34] recovering of sight to the blind. To set
[1:25:37] at liberty them that are bruised. Praise
[1:25:40] God. Hallelujah. to preach the
[1:25:42] acceptable year of the Lord. And he
[1:25:44] closed the book and gave it again to the
[1:25:47] minister and sat down. And the eyes of
[1:25:50] all them that were in the synagogue were
[1:25:52] fastened on him. And he began to say
[1:25:55] unto them, "This day is this scripture
[1:25:58] fulfilled in your ears."
[1:26:00] &gt;&gt; And then a scripture that we all know so
[1:26:03] well, Jesus Christ the same yesterday,
[1:26:08] &gt;&gt; today,
[1:26:09] &gt;&gt; and forever. Amen.
[1:26:11] &gt;&gt; I want to speak about
[1:26:13] &gt;&gt; today,
[1:26:15] &gt;&gt; the promise for today.
[1:26:18] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:26:19] &gt;&gt; And for those of you and the young
[1:26:21] people that are maybe not so familiar
[1:26:23] with the message, if you want to read
[1:26:25] and hear about the other half of the
[1:26:29] scripture, Isaiah 61 and2 where it says
[1:26:33] to preach the acceptable year of the
[1:26:35] Lord and he closed the book. That's half
[1:26:38] of the scripture. If you want to read
[1:26:40] the other half, go into birth pains in
[1:26:44] 1965.
[1:26:45] And brother Brandham had a brand new
[1:26:47] Bible and couldn't get to find the
[1:26:49] scripture he wanted to read. And a
[1:26:51] priest came from behind and said, "Here,
[1:26:54] read it out of my book." And he said
[1:26:56] something about this is the Lord. Read
[1:26:58] it out of my book. He read it out of the
[1:27:00] priest's book and handed it back to him
[1:27:03] and and preached birth pains that the
[1:27:06] earth is in a the throws of another
[1:27:10] birth pain. And he says, "This one's
[1:27:12] going to cause it to go right into
[1:27:14] eternity."
[1:27:16] &gt;&gt; And then he preached right immediately
[1:27:18] after that this day. Cuz then when he
[1:27:21] got back out of there, he he saw the
[1:27:23] whole thing unfold out of the scripture.
[1:27:25] And then he came back and preached this
[1:27:27] day. Is this scripture
[1:27:30] &gt;&gt; fulfilled in your ears?
[1:27:33] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. We're not here on a history
[1:27:36] program, friends. We're not here for
[1:27:38] some pie in the sky in the future. We're
[1:27:40] here because this promise is for this
[1:27:43] day. This message is for this day.
[1:27:46] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. God bless you as you have
[1:27:48] your seats.
[1:27:51] &gt;&gt; God has ordained certain things to
[1:27:53] happen.
[1:27:55] in a certain season
[1:27:57] &gt;&gt; for a certain time.
[1:27:59] &gt;&gt; And that's always been his way.
[1:28:01] &gt;&gt; And by his spoken word, God brought
[1:28:04] forth
[1:28:05] &gt;&gt; and will finish his will and his purpose
[1:28:09] in his in his season.
[1:28:12] &gt;&gt; The Bible tells us quickly, and so
[1:28:14] you'll just stay real attentive because
[1:28:16] I'm going to move along real quickly.
[1:28:18] And God called the light day and the
[1:28:21] darkness he called night in Genesis 1
[1:28:23] and5 as the Bible is being opened. And
[1:28:27] the evening and the morning were the
[1:28:29] first day. I could spend quite a long
[1:28:32] time on the evening and the morning were
[1:28:34] the first day.
[1:28:37] In 1 and8 and God called the firmament
[1:28:39] heaven, and the evening and the morning
[1:28:42] were the second day.
[1:28:44] and 1 and 12. And the earth brought
[1:28:46] forth grass and herb yielding seed after
[1:28:50] his kind, and the tree yielding fruit,
[1:28:52] whose seed was in itself. And the
[1:28:55] evening and the morning were the third
[1:28:57] day. In Genesis 1 and 16, and God made
[1:29:01] two great lights, the greater light to
[1:29:04] rule the day, and the lesser light to
[1:29:05] rule the night, and he made the stars
[1:29:08] also, and the evening and the morning
[1:29:10] were the fourth day. God had a program
[1:29:13] and he stuck right with the program. He
[1:29:16] did on the second day and the third day
[1:29:18] and the first day and the fifth day what
[1:29:21] he wanted to do on that day
[1:29:24] &gt;&gt; in that time. And God created great
[1:29:27] wield great whales and every living
[1:29:30] creature that moveth which waters
[1:29:33] brought forth abundantly after their
[1:29:35] kind. And the evening and the morning
[1:29:38] were the fifth day. And God said, "Let
[1:29:41] the earth bring forth a living creature
[1:29:43] after his kind, cattle and creeping
[1:29:45] things, and the beast of the earth after
[1:29:49] his kind." And it was so. And God made
[1:29:52] the beast of the earth after his kind,
[1:29:55] and the cattle after their kind, and
[1:29:57] everything that creepeth upon the earth.
[1:30:00] And God said, "Let us make man in our
[1:30:03] image, after our likeness, and let them
[1:30:06] have dominion over the sea, and over the
[1:30:08] fowl, and over the cattle, and over the
[1:30:10] earth, and over every creeping thing."
[1:30:12] So God created man in his own image, in
[1:30:16] the image of God created he him, male
[1:30:19] and female created he them. And God saw
[1:30:23] everything that he had made. And behold,
[1:30:26] it was very good. And the evening and
[1:30:28] the morning were the sixth day.
[1:30:31] And on the seventh day, God ended his
[1:30:34] work which he had made and he rested on
[1:30:37] the seventh day from it all. In other
[1:30:40] words, God did specific things. And we
[1:30:44] say, well, that day was a thousand years
[1:30:46] long. And we also have a message which
[1:30:50] the prophet has spoken of that is the
[1:30:52] message of this day, but it's not a
[1:30:54] 24-hour period. It's a certain it's a
[1:30:58] certain period of time and and that's
[1:31:01] all within God's God's spirit may fall
[1:31:04] and come at a certain moment and you
[1:31:07] know as it did on the day of Pentecost
[1:31:09] and then there'll be a moment there will
[1:31:11] be there will be a point in time when
[1:31:14] the Holy Spirit actually lifts off of
[1:31:16] the earth.
[1:31:18] the Holy Spirit will lift off of the
[1:31:20] earth and God will leave all wickedness
[1:31:23] to itself void of any restraint.
[1:31:27] &gt;&gt; You think it almost looks like that
[1:31:29] right now and sometimes I think it
[1:31:31] almost is like that. But I'm glad for
[1:31:33] the tug of the Holy Spirit. We may not
[1:31:36] see where the kite is, but we got the
[1:31:39] string in our hand and we can feel the
[1:31:41] pull of the Holy Spirit and it's pulling
[1:31:44] us upward
[1:31:45] &gt;&gt; all the time. And and the prophet of God
[1:31:48] said in the message shalom, the word of
[1:31:50] Moses time did not work in the days of
[1:31:53] Jesus time. Jesus couldn't come with
[1:31:56] Moses message. The word in the days of
[1:31:59] the apostles does not work. He said in
[1:32:02] this day,
[1:32:03] &gt;&gt; it's a promised word for this day.
[1:32:06] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:32:07] &gt;&gt; You believe that? Amen.
[1:32:09] &gt;&gt; And so the scripture says the apostle
[1:32:11] Paul when he's speaking now to the
[1:32:13] Hebrews that were believing in Moses and
[1:32:18] they would always refer back to Moses.
[1:32:20] He said, "Wherefore, holy brethren,
[1:32:23] those these were Hebrews and Jews who
[1:32:26] had come out uh and and and and as a
[1:32:29] result of the early church and the power
[1:32:32] of God in the church, there had been
[1:32:34] Hebrew believers. And now he's speaking
[1:32:36] to them because he doesn't want them to
[1:32:38] lapse back into the previous age like
[1:32:42] many even in the message unfortunately
[1:32:45] have lapsed back to a denominational
[1:32:48] methods denominational ideas and even
[1:32:51] even so into the message a
[1:32:54] denominational doctrine.
[1:32:58] &gt;&gt; Wherefore holy brethren he's saying
[1:33:00] partakers of the heavenly calling.
[1:33:03] Wherefore, as the Holy Ghost saith, who
[1:33:06] sang it? The Holy Ghost saith
[1:33:09] &gt;&gt; today,
[1:33:11] &gt;&gt; if you will hear his voice,
[1:33:13] &gt;&gt; he said, take heed, brethren, verse 12,
[1:33:16] lest there be in any of you an evil
[1:33:19] heart of unbelief in departing from the
[1:33:21] living God. And when when Jesus was
[1:33:24] confronted with the apost not the
[1:33:26] apostles I'm sorry the scribes and
[1:33:28] Pharisees and the religious leaders and
[1:33:32] about the resurrection and various
[1:33:34] questions
[1:33:35] and and and Jesus had to tell them God
[1:33:39] is not a god of the dead.
[1:33:41] &gt;&gt; God is a God of the living.
[1:33:44] &gt;&gt; When he says God's a God of the living,
[1:33:46] what's he saying? God's a God of the
[1:33:48] now.
[1:33:49] &gt;&gt; God's a God of today. Amen.
[1:33:52] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:33:53] &gt;&gt; Jesus Christ the same yesterday, today,
[1:33:56] &gt;&gt; and forever.
[1:33:58] &gt;&gt; That's what's important. Brother
[1:33:59] Brandham used that phrase, Jesus Christ
[1:34:02] the same yesterday, today, and forever
[1:34:06] over 600 times in his ministry, starting
[1:34:11] at the very earliest of the message and
[1:34:14] starting and it goes on service after
[1:34:16] service every year. every year and
[1:34:20] multitudes of days, multitudes of
[1:34:22] cities. I ask you, was there any time
[1:34:26] that he spoke that that Jesus was not
[1:34:28] effective on that day?
[1:34:33] &gt;&gt; You get my point?
[1:34:35] &gt;&gt; Here's a prophet on earth and he's
[1:34:36] saying in 1947 448 Jesus Christ the same
[1:34:41] yesterday, today, and forever. Was he
[1:34:44] impre was he trying to impress the
[1:34:47] people that he was the he that it was
[1:34:49] yesterday or that it's tomorrow he's
[1:34:52] concerned with? No. He wants the people
[1:34:54] to be impressed with it's today.
[1:34:57] &gt;&gt; Jesus Christ today. And so he said now
[1:35:01] I'll prove the resurrection of Jesus
[1:35:03] Christ. He said if you believed it back
[1:35:05] then you might say he said oh if I was
[1:35:08] back then I would have believed it. He
[1:35:11] said, "It's the same one who's here now.
[1:35:14] &gt;&gt; I'm here to prove he's here today.
[1:35:17] &gt;&gt; This message is not a message of
[1:35:19] yesterday. It's not a whole bunch of
[1:35:21] scheming about tomorrow or the future.
[1:35:24] We're not trying to study and dissect
[1:35:27] every age and every time and how this
[1:35:30] person did it." But all we look at the
[1:35:32] past is to say that's the way he was
[1:35:35] back there and he had believers back
[1:35:37] there who believed he was alive today.
[1:35:40] Amen.
[1:35:41] &gt;&gt; All through the whole New Testament,
[1:35:43] they had a witness of the Holy Spirit.
[1:35:45] He's alive today and they received what
[1:35:48] he what they had. Some some didn't have
[1:35:51] it. They were thinking of only the
[1:35:53] future. And brother Brandon says that's
[1:35:55] that's the problem with man. We we
[1:35:57] rejoice in what he was and we have
[1:36:00] anticipation of what he will be, but we
[1:36:03] miss what he is. Now,
[1:36:06] &gt;&gt; let this congregation know we're not
[1:36:08] talking about the past or the future.
[1:36:11] We're talking about this moment.
[1:36:13] &gt;&gt; We're talking about this service.
[1:36:16] &gt;&gt; We're talking about this moment where
[1:36:18] you sit and what you hear.
[1:36:20] &gt;&gt; What we believe is a God
[1:36:23] &gt;&gt; by the Holy Spirit.
[1:36:25] &gt;&gt; I believe that he's present now.
[1:36:28] &gt;&gt; I believe what he did back there, he is
[1:36:31] here to do now again. If
[1:36:34] &gt;&gt; you have not been filled with the Holy
[1:36:36] Ghost, he will fill you with the true
[1:36:38] Holy Spirit. Hallelujah. Which is which
[1:36:42] is the full revelation and understanding
[1:36:44] of the word of God.
[1:36:46] &gt;&gt; The Holy Spirit's the author of this
[1:36:48] word. It's the Holy Spirit that was
[1:36:51] speaking through a prophet in this time.
[1:36:54] That was the Holy Spirit. It's not
[1:36:56] yesterday. It's now today.
[1:37:00] &gt;&gt; You need a drink from the fountain. You
[1:37:02] don't want stagnant water from the past.
[1:37:05] You don't want to think about, oh, there
[1:37:07] might be some rain in the future. You
[1:37:09] want to say, today
[1:37:11] &gt;&gt; the showers of blessing are falling.
[1:37:14] &gt;&gt; Today I have a resource.
[1:37:18] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:37:20] &gt;&gt; This is the day.
[1:37:25] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen.
[1:37:27] &gt;&gt; Wherefore, holy brethren,
[1:37:30] &gt;&gt; he's a God of the living.
[1:37:32] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:37:33] &gt;&gt; The living God is nothing less than the
[1:37:36] living word.
[1:37:37] &gt;&gt; This message
[1:37:39] &gt;&gt; is not just a series of books and tapes
[1:37:41] and discs.
[1:37:42] &gt;&gt; This message is a living word.
[1:37:46] &gt;&gt; It's alive.
[1:37:47] &gt;&gt; It's vibrant. It has a personality
[1:37:50] because it's none less than Jesus
[1:37:52] Christ.
[1:37:53] &gt;&gt; You can feel him. Yes,
[1:37:55] &gt;&gt; you can talk to him.
[1:37:58] &gt;&gt; It's a living person.
[1:38:01] &gt;&gt; If you think it's a book, you'll never
[1:38:02] you'll miss him.
[1:38:04] &gt;&gt; If you think it's something of 40 years
[1:38:06] ago, you'll miss it.
[1:38:08] &gt;&gt; It's not 40 years ago. Brother Brandon
[1:38:11] was proving he was the same then. Jesus
[1:38:13] Christ the same yesterday in 48, in 49,
[1:38:17] in 1950, in 51, in 52, up in 64, 65,
[1:38:24] into the last messages.
[1:38:27] Why? Because he was the same one.
[1:38:31] &gt;&gt; And he was proving meeting after
[1:38:34] meeting, month after month, that he is
[1:38:36] alive.
[1:38:38] &gt;&gt; And that's what you and I are here for.
[1:38:40] &gt;&gt; We're not here just to be blessed. We're
[1:38:42] here to prove that he is alive
[1:38:45] &gt;&gt; and that indeed he lives in me and he
[1:38:48] lives in you and that's your purpose of
[1:38:51] being here.
[1:38:52] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:38:54] &gt;&gt; May it be so.
[1:38:56] &gt;&gt; In the name of Jesus Christ, may the
[1:38:59] Holy Ghost fall upon this congregation
[1:39:03] and give you a revelation that you are
[1:39:05] here on a mission. You are here. You are
[1:39:08] called of God. You're here for a special
[1:39:12] purpose.
[1:39:13] &gt;&gt; To prove that he's alive
[1:39:16] &gt;&gt; so that he can get glory.
[1:39:19] &gt;&gt; We are here to get glory to the name of
[1:39:21] Jesus Christ.
[1:39:24] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:39:25] [Applause]
[1:39:27] &gt;&gt; Jesus said to the leaders that they had
[1:39:30] aired. He says, "I'm the God of Abraham
[1:39:33] and the God of Isaac and the God of
[1:39:35] Jacob." God is not the God of the dead,
[1:39:39] &gt;&gt; but of the living.
[1:39:41] &gt;&gt; He's for the living.
[1:39:43] &gt;&gt; He's in the time of the living.
[1:39:46] &gt;&gt; He's here to do whatever it is that we
[1:39:49] have need.
[1:39:50] And Jesus said unto him in Luke 24:43,
[1:39:54] "Verily I say unto thee, speaking to the
[1:39:58] thief on the cross, who was changed, a
[1:40:01] treacherous man,
[1:40:03] &gt;&gt; a man who lived by treachery
[1:40:06] &gt;&gt; and horrible crimes.
[1:40:09] They It was the worst of criminals that
[1:40:11] hung on a cross.
[1:40:13] &gt;&gt; And he was hanging there. And the Bible
[1:40:15] says in two of the two of the epistles
[1:40:18] that the thieves plural railed on him.
[1:40:22] &gt;&gt; They railed on him. They railed on Jesus
[1:40:25] Christ. But no one some some kind of an
[1:40:29] atmosphere. Something came over him and
[1:40:33] he began to see that this man and he
[1:40:36] even rebuked his friend. He said this he
[1:40:39] said we suffer justly for our crimes.
[1:40:43] This man has done nothing.
[1:40:45] &gt;&gt; He's done nothing. And finally, his eyes
[1:40:49] were opened and he saw something. He
[1:40:52] received a revelation the apostles
[1:40:54] didn't have.
[1:40:56] &gt;&gt; He received a a revelation that Mary,
[1:40:59] who the Catholic Church lifts up to
[1:41:01] heaven, Mary didn't have it.
[1:41:05] &gt;&gt; None of the women had it.
[1:41:07] &gt;&gt; None of the men had it.
[1:41:09] &gt;&gt; But the thief on the cross got it.
[1:41:13] [Music]
[1:41:14] Hallelujah.
[1:41:15] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:41:17] &gt;&gt; And he was the last one
[1:41:19] &gt;&gt; under that dispensation.
[1:41:22] &gt;&gt; The last one that came in.
[1:41:24] &gt;&gt; He didn't see the first pull. He didn't
[1:41:26] see the second pull of Jesus ministry.
[1:41:29] He didn't hear his message of his third
[1:41:32] pull. But on the cross, he got a
[1:41:35] revelation that was beyond any of them
[1:41:37] that heard. Amen.
[1:41:39] &gt;&gt; It was beyond those that ate the bread
[1:41:41] and the fishes.
[1:41:44] &gt;&gt; It was beyond those that just got
[1:41:46] blessed at a camp or in a service.
[1:41:48] &gt;&gt; He got a revelation from God.
[1:41:52] &gt;&gt; Lord,
[1:41:54] &gt;&gt; Lord,
[1:41:56] remember me.
[1:41:58] &gt;&gt; When you come into your kingdom,
[1:42:01] &gt;&gt; he recognized he was a king.
[1:42:03] &gt;&gt; He recognized there was a kingdom. And
[1:42:06] he recognized he wasn't dying, but he
[1:42:08] was coming into his kingdom.
[1:42:16] &gt;&gt; And what was Jesus first word? Today,
[1:42:21] &gt;&gt; why don't you say it? Today
[1:42:24] &gt;&gt; you'll be with me
[1:42:26] &gt;&gt; in paradise.
[1:42:29] &gt;&gt; Not tomorrow. Not some pie in the sky.
[1:42:33] &gt;&gt; Not some history from the past. Today
[1:42:37] &gt;&gt; you'll be with me in paradise.
[1:42:42] &gt;&gt; I say hallelujah.
[1:42:45] &gt;&gt; Glory to God.
[1:42:49] &gt;&gt; It's hard for me to lower my voice.
[1:42:52] &gt;&gt; I just I feel so enthused, so gripped
[1:42:56] and so moved.
[1:42:59] &gt;&gt; This is the same Jesus.
[1:43:02] The same one that stood on hung on the
[1:43:04] cross and said today he's here today.
[1:43:08] &gt;&gt; He's here in this service. His holy
[1:43:10] spirit is here. And his holy spirit is
[1:43:14] pleased that I'm telling you he's a god
[1:43:16] of the living. He's a god of today. He
[1:43:20] wants to fill you. He wants to move you.
[1:43:23] He wants to do things for you.
[1:43:26] &gt;&gt; You're his children.
[1:43:31] Hallelujah.
[1:43:34] [Music]
[1:43:37] &gt;&gt; Brother Bren says, "Man is still the
[1:43:39] same.
[1:43:40] &gt;&gt; He's always thanking God for what he has
[1:43:42] done.
[1:43:44] &gt;&gt; Looking forward to what he will do
[1:43:46] &gt;&gt; and ignoring what he is doing.
[1:43:49] &gt;&gt; I want you to be able to look up and
[1:43:51] say, "Father, I'm not ignoring what
[1:43:53] you're doing. You're a God of the now.
[1:43:57] &gt;&gt; You're a God of this moment.
[1:43:59] The only thing that stands in our way is
[1:44:01] our unbelief.
[1:44:02] &gt;&gt; We put it off or we elevate our problem
[1:44:07] &gt;&gt; higher than his power to deliver.
[1:44:10] &gt;&gt; God is not concerned about your problem
[1:44:13] because his power is greater than your
[1:44:15] problem.
[1:44:18] [Applause]
[1:44:19] [Music]
[1:44:26] &gt;&gt; You believe it?
[1:44:33] There's too many today
[1:44:36] within the ranks of the message.
[1:44:39] They read what the Holy Ghost has spoken
[1:44:42] in this day and yet somehow ignore it or
[1:44:47] simply will not receive it.
[1:44:52] I have read the powerful truths of the
[1:44:56] message to those who have professed to
[1:44:59] be believers and who have sat in
[1:45:01] churches claiming and they have a
[1:45:04] profession but I have found it to be an
[1:45:06] empty profession because when they say
[1:45:09] this is what the word says this is
[1:45:11] exactly what pro God's messenger has
[1:45:14] said and somehow they will take their
[1:45:18] events or they will take what their
[1:45:21] thoughts are and somehow ev it evolves
[1:45:26] into something else. And really what it
[1:45:29] is, really what it is, listen to me very
[1:45:32] closely now.
[1:45:34] There's a danger lest we take the
[1:45:38] circumstances of our lives
[1:45:41] &gt;&gt; or where we are in our present life and
[1:45:43] our present condition or our present
[1:45:46] experience and take the message and the
[1:45:49] message says something different.
[1:45:51] Rather, as the prophet says, we need to
[1:45:54] make surrender our lives to be molded to
[1:45:59] that.
[1:46:00] &gt;&gt; But what they do instead is adjust this
[1:46:03] until it fits their present situation.
[1:46:06] &gt;&gt; That's not what God wants.
[1:46:09] &gt;&gt; That's not the program of God
[1:46:11] &gt;&gt; to to take the message.
[1:46:14] &gt;&gt; Amen. And I I thought of, and I'm not
[1:46:16] wanting to put any uh
[1:46:20] any bondage on you, but to say, why are
[1:46:23] you here?
[1:46:27] &gt;&gt; Well, I'm here because my friends are
[1:46:29] here.
[1:46:30] &gt;&gt; Sorry, that's the wrong reason.
[1:46:34] &gt;&gt; I'm here because my husband or my wife
[1:46:36] is here. Even that's the wrong reason.
[1:46:40] &gt;&gt; I'm here because I was born and raised
[1:46:42] in the message. And uh uh and so I just
[1:46:46] this is the pattern of my life. That's
[1:46:48] the wrong reason.
[1:46:50] &gt;&gt; What a person you say well what is the
[1:46:52] right reason. The right reason is I have
[1:46:55] had an experience with this living God.
[1:46:58] &gt;&gt; He has spoken to me. I have felt his I
[1:47:01] have felt him in my heart. I have felt a
[1:47:04] a work within my soul. I feel him
[1:47:06] moving. I hear him speaking. I have a
[1:47:09] relationship with him. And I know that
[1:47:11] he's alive. And I come to hear the word
[1:47:14] of God preached. I come to have my soul
[1:47:18] edified. And that's why I come to the
[1:47:21] house of God. I come here also to be a
[1:47:24] blessing to someone else. I come here
[1:47:26] because I'm a member of the body of
[1:47:28] Jesus Christ. I come to shake their
[1:47:30] hand. I come to let my words, the best
[1:47:32] words out of my mouth. God bless you.
[1:47:36] &gt;&gt; That's why I come. That's why I'm here.
[1:47:38] Then we're here for the right reason.
[1:47:41] And if we have a church full of people
[1:47:43] that come for those reasons, then you're
[1:47:45] going to see things move. You're going
[1:47:47] to see the supernatural happen because
[1:47:50] you cannot stop it.
[1:47:53] [Applause]
[1:47:56] &gt;&gt; I want to address the young people for a
[1:47:58] moment, the youth, and those of you that
[1:48:00] are in your teens and so on. What a
[1:48:02] wonderful time of your life. What a
[1:48:06] wonderful era when you got your youth
[1:48:09] and your strength and your beauty and
[1:48:12] your your physique for you young men.
[1:48:15] What an opportunity.
[1:48:17] &gt;&gt; What a glorious time
[1:48:20] &gt;&gt; to give it to God's work and to God's
[1:48:23] people. What a wonderful privilege it is
[1:48:27] to be able to say, "Well, I'm so
[1:48:29] thankful I could give my time and give
[1:48:33] my energy to the work of God. Don't get
[1:48:36] quiet on me now.
[1:48:39] &gt;&gt; I thought of you, Brother Raymond,
[1:48:41] Sister Ree, or your wife. I thought of
[1:48:42] you. I thought of you, Sister Karen. I
[1:48:45] thought of the meals that have been I
[1:48:46] thought of you sisters that have worked
[1:48:48] amongst the uh young people." Yeah.
[1:48:51] &gt;&gt; And you you say, "Well," and some might
[1:48:53] say, "Oh, well, I I haven't got any time
[1:48:55] for that. I haven't got I don't even go
[1:48:57] off to those camps. I haven't got any
[1:48:58] time." What about the cup of cold water?
[1:49:03] &gt;&gt; What about the cup of cold water?
[1:49:05] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:49:05] &gt;&gt; We could preach a cold water
[1:49:07] &gt;&gt; doctrine. What about that cup of cold
[1:49:10] water?
[1:49:10] &gt;&gt; You got times I take and hand a cup of
[1:49:13] cold water. Not if somebody comes
[1:49:15] panting and and and desperately needing
[1:49:18] a cup. That's not it. You offer it,
[1:49:21] &gt;&gt; you give it. Lighten up their load and
[1:49:24] make their life easier and you bless
[1:49:26] them with it.
[1:49:27] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:49:29] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:49:30] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:49:31] &gt;&gt; One year I and my wife,
[1:49:34] we said, you know, our ch our children
[1:49:38] were quite small and we naturally have
[1:49:40] them home around the Christmas holidays
[1:49:43] and that time. So, you know what we're
[1:49:45] going to do? We're going to invite
[1:49:47] people, not friends. These are people we
[1:49:50] hardly know. We're going to invite them
[1:49:53] to our home. We're going to have them
[1:49:55] here for dinner. We did that on one
[1:49:58] occasion. We did it on another occasion
[1:50:00] when we were we're still in the log
[1:50:02] church. We said, "We're going to have
[1:50:04] people that don't have a home and don't
[1:50:07] have a family and we know they have no
[1:50:09] place to go. We're going to have them
[1:50:12] for over Christmas season." And it was
[1:50:14] one of those that sat uh he he he was a
[1:50:17] he was a believer brother working in the
[1:50:19] logging camps and he sat on our couch
[1:50:22] and I was sitting right across from him.
[1:50:24] He took his billfold out and pulled out
[1:50:26] a little picture and it was a picture of
[1:50:30] the boy from Finland that had been
[1:50:32] raised from the dead and he held the
[1:50:34] picture up. Now this is a stranger, not
[1:50:36] a stranger entirely, but he was not a
[1:50:39] part of the our church. She was over
[1:50:41] living on Vancouver Island going to Mike
[1:50:42] and Maryland's uh church and he just
[1:50:45] held this little picture up. He says,
[1:50:47] "Do do you have you seen this picture?"
[1:50:49] "Oh, yes." I said, "I've seen that
[1:50:51] picture. That's the boy that was raised
[1:50:53] from the dead in Finland." He said,
[1:50:55] "Yeah, that's right." He says, "I was
[1:50:57] just in his home. I was just visiting
[1:50:59] him." I thought, "What a reward."
[1:51:04] &gt;&gt; All we had to give was a little bit of
[1:51:06] turkey or chicken or something. And here
[1:51:08] I'm sitting with a brother that has
[1:51:10] talked with this boy that been raised
[1:51:12] from the dead. He said he's a he's a
[1:51:15] traffic policeman now outside of the
[1:51:17] city of Helsinki. That's the only man
[1:51:20] I've ever met in all my life that sat
[1:51:23] and talked to that boy.
[1:51:27] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:51:28] &gt;&gt; And here we hadn't even fed him yet.
[1:51:31] &gt;&gt; And God already gave me a reward before
[1:51:33] we even had a chance to feed him. I
[1:51:36] thought, how wonderful. Here I am. I
[1:51:38] don't know how many people in the world
[1:51:40] got to sit with him. How many people I
[1:51:42] saw that picture many times, but now I
[1:51:44] can say to you, I got to talk to the man
[1:51:47] who sat and talked to the boy that was
[1:51:49] raised from the dead. Hallelujah.
[1:51:52] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:51:52] &gt;&gt; He's a God of today.
[1:51:56] &gt;&gt; And you young people, believe me, you
[1:51:59] will never regret.
[1:52:01] &gt;&gt; Amen. Even the children, you'll never
[1:52:04] regret giving your heart to Jesus
[1:52:07] Christ. And you parents and older
[1:52:09] people, you'll never regret praying for
[1:52:12] them. You teachers, God bless you.
[1:52:14] Sister Jenny, brother uh Terry John,
[1:52:17] Sister Ramona, God bless you teachers,
[1:52:20] you'll never regret
[1:52:22] &gt;&gt; harboring those children, praying for
[1:52:24] them, and letting them get a part of
[1:52:26] your heart. You'll never regret it. You
[1:52:29] people here, you'll never regret having
[1:52:33] identified yourself with Jesus Christ in
[1:52:35] this day.
[1:52:37] &gt;&gt; He's been crucified again.
[1:52:39] &gt;&gt; He's despised,
[1:52:41] &gt;&gt; but we've been given an opportunity to
[1:52:42] bring him another drink of fresh water.
[1:52:47] &gt;&gt; Do it.
[1:52:48] &gt;&gt; Give him the best part of your life.
[1:52:51] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:52:52] &gt;&gt; Thought a lot about you, brother Daniel.
[1:52:54] What was it? 14 years old. you start to
[1:52:58] do something. I I thought of this
[1:53:00] brother. He needs to give his testimony
[1:53:02] for you young people.
[1:53:04] &gt;&gt; And here he started as a young just a
[1:53:06] young teenager with just a passion to do
[1:53:09] something for God and wrote me an email
[1:53:12] in the last few days. You know what his
[1:53:14] the title on his email is? Forgive me
[1:53:17] for saying this. His email is last week.
[1:53:20] My preoccupation.
[1:53:23] &gt;&gt; I'm preoccupied.
[1:53:25] Right.
[1:53:26] &gt;&gt; I can't get this out of my mind.
[1:53:28] &gt;&gt; I'm here to do something for God.
[1:53:31] &gt;&gt; May God open doors for you.
[1:53:34] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:53:36] &gt;&gt; Want you to know they got a hold of my
[1:53:37] heart cuz I was about that same age and
[1:53:40] I had that was my preoccupation but I
[1:53:43] didn't know it at the time.
[1:53:44] &gt;&gt; I just couldn't get rid of it.
[1:53:46] &gt;&gt; I'm not here because I have to have a
[1:53:48] pulpit to preach in. I got invitation
[1:53:51] from South America, from Brazil, and
[1:53:53] from Peru. And I got about four or five
[1:53:56] in one week last week.
[1:54:00] &gt;&gt; People think they can discredit a
[1:54:01] ministry.
[1:54:09] &gt;&gt; It ain't going to happen that easy,
[1:54:10] friend.
[1:54:12] &gt;&gt; From Germany and from Switzerland and
[1:54:14] from Moscow and from Peru and from
[1:54:16] Brazil and from Cape Town, South Africa
[1:54:19] in about about 10 days time. Can't even
[1:54:22] go to them. Amen.
[1:54:24] &gt;&gt; Can't even near go to them.
[1:54:26] &gt;&gt; I feel a responsibility. But I'm saying
[1:54:28] here to this church,
[1:54:30] &gt;&gt; this God,
[1:54:32] &gt;&gt; and I I I I'm here behind this pulpit to
[1:54:34] tell you the truth of God's word is the
[1:54:37] same in my heart today as it was
[1:54:39] yesterday as it was when I was 18 or
[1:54:42] when I was 20.
[1:54:44] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen.
[1:54:46] &gt;&gt; There's nothing to get in a car and
[1:54:48] drive all night to go to another place,
[1:54:50] drive through the mud, pick up kids, let
[1:54:53] a new car get full of mud because why?
[1:54:56] Just wanted to do something for God.
[1:54:58] &gt;&gt; Pounded over some of the worst roads you
[1:55:00] could imagine to go to the native Indian
[1:55:02] people to have a meeting outside. Oh,
[1:55:05] was it some big arrangement? No. We just
[1:55:07] went there and they gathered. And do you
[1:55:09] think I regret it? Not for a minute.
[1:55:13] &gt;&gt; Not for a minute.
[1:55:15] put our kids in the back of the station
[1:55:16] wagon and drive all night to get home so
[1:55:19] they can go to school in the morning. I
[1:55:22] never regret that.
[1:55:24] &gt;&gt; No. And you mightn't say, "Well, that's
[1:55:25] your situation." That's exactly right.
[1:55:27] But in your place, you can brighten the
[1:55:30] corner where you are.
[1:55:32] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. You don't need We don't need
[1:55:34] a big pulpit. We don't need a big church
[1:55:36] for you to be able to do that.
[1:55:39] &gt;&gt; Be fruitful
[1:55:40] &gt;&gt; in the kingdom of God.
[1:55:42] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:55:44] You have to help me to shut down.
[1:55:47] &gt;&gt; I'm not getting anywhere with my sermon.
[1:56:00] &gt;&gt; As part of my burden,
[1:56:05] I've witnessed and I feel I have to say
[1:56:08] these things. I've witnessed in this
[1:56:11] message
[1:56:12] very troubling things I've witnessed in
[1:56:16] this message where ministers and
[1:56:20] believers and where ministers will even
[1:56:22] allow
[1:56:25] their people and not only allow their
[1:56:28] people will lead their people
[1:56:31] because they themselves they've allowed
[1:56:34] the message to evolve into something
[1:56:37] nothing more than an empty profession.
[1:56:42] &gt;&gt; It's an empty profession.
[1:56:45] &gt;&gt; And they're just certain they know the
[1:56:47] right language and know the right words
[1:56:49] and talk about Malachi 4 and Luke 17:30
[1:56:52] and and Revelation 1 and 10 and 1 and
[1:56:55] and all of these things.
[1:56:57] &gt;&gt; To me, it's not an empty profession.
[1:57:00] It's a living, burning presence of a
[1:57:04] living God
[1:57:07] &gt;&gt; that's alive now today.
[1:57:11] &gt;&gt; And I want some that some of what I'm
[1:57:14] feeling to pour off onto you.
[1:57:17] &gt;&gt; If you don't feel it, let it pour onto
[1:57:19] you.
[1:57:20] &gt;&gt; Even just say this morning, "Oh God, let
[1:57:23] what let what Brother Ed is feeling, let
[1:57:26] let it pour into me as well. Let my soul
[1:57:29] be consumed
[1:57:32] &gt;&gt; to live for you.
[1:57:33] &gt;&gt; Even if you live quietly, live for him.
[1:57:36] &gt;&gt; Spend your life for him.
[1:57:40] &gt;&gt; Let it be, as our brother Daniel said,
[1:57:42] &gt;&gt; preoccupation.
[1:57:45] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:57:46] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. It's not enough just to
[1:57:48] admire somebody else and admire brother
[1:57:51] Murphy or brother Ivan or brother
[1:57:54] Timothy or some of these. We don't have
[1:57:57] to be out in front.
[1:57:59] &gt;&gt; We don't have to be that. We just have
[1:58:01] to be at our post of duty.
[1:58:03] &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham, here he is. Who who
[1:58:06] had a bigger portion? Nobody. And nobody
[1:58:09] had a bigger portion in this generation.
[1:58:12] But to have him say, "If you're a
[1:58:13] housewife,
[1:58:15] &gt;&gt; you're a housewife here. God bless you.
[1:58:18] You have a tremendous mission on earth.
[1:58:21] Young man, young woman,
[1:58:23] &gt;&gt; singles, whatever we are, children,
[1:58:26] young people, farmers, be the best one.
[1:58:29] &gt;&gt; Whatever you can do.
[1:58:32] &gt;&gt; You're in business, be the best one.
[1:58:34] &gt;&gt; You're a worker, be the best one you can
[1:58:36] be. Let that be your testimony. Say,
[1:58:39] "Until God moves me out of here, I'm
[1:58:41] going to be the best I can
[1:58:43] &gt;&gt; right where I'm at.
[1:58:44] &gt;&gt; And I'm going to make myself available.
[1:58:51] Hallelujah.
[1:58:59] &gt;&gt; I just wish I could do so much more.
[1:59:03] &gt;&gt; I just have a fire burning in my bones.
[1:59:10] Have people some people that come by
[1:59:13] hear it all the time. Ridicule.
[1:59:16] Maybe something that I've had missions
[1:59:19] ridiculed.
[1:59:26] &gt;&gt; They haven't looked
[1:59:28] into the faces of people like brother
[1:59:30] Daniel
[1:59:34] and look into my eyes and I look into
[1:59:37] those dark eyes
[1:59:40] and he wants the message if I can only
[1:59:43] have it. Do you know how I can get it?
[1:59:48] And then I come home to say, "Oh, that
[1:59:51] missions."
[1:59:59] &gt;&gt; You know, somebody put himself forward
[2:00:01] as a minister.
[2:00:03] They talked about missions.
[2:00:06] Of course,
[2:00:08] we've been out there in front for a long
[2:00:10] time.
[2:00:19] And some of the stuff you don't want to
[2:00:20] hear, but you might as well hear it. I
[2:00:22] had to hear it.
[2:00:30] &gt;&gt; And he said, "Missions."
[2:00:32] And spat on the platform.
[2:00:41] you're quiet
[2:00:48] and I had some great revelation.
[2:01:01] Do you think I can say a little what you
[2:01:04] said in your email, Sister Karen?
[2:01:11] a minister
[2:01:13] of this message supposed to be I don't
[2:01:16] consider a minister not the message I
[2:01:18] know
[2:01:23] &gt;&gt; taking groups of young girls young
[2:01:25] ladies
[2:01:29] &gt;&gt; and he doesn't have a wife at this time
[2:01:32] and he's taking young ladies on scuba
[2:01:35] diving trip
[2:01:39] to some other country s southern country
[2:01:42] in the Caribbean
[2:01:44] minister this message says he is and
[2:01:48] people hold him as a pastor and afraid
[2:01:53] to leave. I tell you what this prophet
[2:01:56] said if a pastor doesn't preach this
[2:01:58] message and doesn't believe this word
[2:02:01] I'd leave him.
[2:02:04] &gt;&gt; And that'd be my advice to anybody here
[2:02:06] in this congregation or streaming. If a
[2:02:08] me if a pro if a minister of this
[2:02:11] message wouldn't declare the whole
[2:02:12] council of God and believe it and live
[2:02:15] by it, I'd leave him.
[2:02:18] &gt;&gt; And if I don't believe every part of
[2:02:20] this word, then you're free to leave it
[2:02:23] &gt;&gt; and leave me.
[2:02:25] &gt;&gt; But first, before you do, pray for me.
[2:02:30] &gt;&gt; That'd be the most important thing.
[2:02:32] &gt;&gt; Pray for the man of God.
[2:02:35] But I wouldn't I wouldn't couch out of
[2:02:37] that. I wouldn't give into that.
[2:02:40] &gt;&gt; And regardless of how many may speak
[2:02:41] against missions or against they don't
[2:02:44] they haven't experienced what I've
[2:02:46] experienced. You could not take it. It's
[2:02:48] a part of my own soul. You'd have to cut
[2:02:50] my heart out.
[2:02:52] &gt;&gt; And that's the way the people What about
[2:02:54] Jesus Christ? What is the last
[2:02:56] commission? And the prophet of God said
[2:02:58] the great commission.
[2:02:59] &gt;&gt; And God never took that commission away.
[2:03:02] He says it'll be a part of the church
[2:03:04] till we go home.
[2:03:06] &gt;&gt; Go ye
[2:03:08] &gt;&gt; into all the world
[2:03:09] &gt;&gt; and preach the gospel.
[2:03:12] &gt;&gt; This is the gospel.
[2:03:14] &gt;&gt; You have the gospel. God's entrusted to
[2:03:17] you the gospel of this hour because it
[2:03:20] is a living word.
[2:03:24] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:03:25] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:03:26] &gt;&gt; It's not a word of yesterday.
[2:03:29] &gt;&gt; It's today. If you hear his voice,
[2:03:32] &gt;&gt; harden not your heart. As in the
[2:03:35] provocation when they when I he tried
[2:03:38] him in the wilderness. Don't harden your
[2:03:40] heart. Don't have any resistance. Just
[2:03:42] say, "Oh God, I throw my heart's door
[2:03:45] wide open.
[2:03:47] &gt;&gt; Talk to me.
[2:03:49] &gt;&gt; Invite him.
[2:04:02] Sometimes people feel well you shouldn't
[2:04:03] say anything negative over the pulpit. I
[2:04:05] Jesus said quite a few things were
[2:04:06] negative.
[2:04:08] &gt;&gt; But when you say them in a certain way
[2:04:09] then they can be a positive thing.
[2:04:12] &gt;&gt; A warning can be a positive thing.
[2:04:25] an end time message. End time messenger.
[2:04:29] Can I have a few more minutes, please?
[2:04:34] Brother Brandon was talking about the
[2:04:35] woman at the well and he said she left
[2:04:37] her water pot and ran into the city and
[2:04:40] said, "Come see a man that told me all
[2:04:42] things that ever I did. Isn't this the
[2:04:44] very Messiah?" That's him. He said, "If
[2:04:46] the people could only see that today."
[2:04:49] &gt;&gt; He was going back there 2,000 years ago,
[2:04:51] but then he brings it forward 2,000
[2:04:53] years. If the people,
[2:04:55] &gt;&gt; are we people?
[2:04:57] &gt;&gt; We're humans.
[2:04:59] &gt;&gt; He's talking about us. If they could
[2:05:01] only see it today,
[2:05:04] &gt;&gt; he says, "Then they'd know the day we're
[2:05:06] living in."
[2:05:08] &gt;&gt; And they would see it's God's promise
[2:05:11] for this day. Amen.
[2:05:14] &gt;&gt; God said it would be this way.
[2:05:17] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:05:17] &gt;&gt; I love the scripture which we read
[2:05:19] because I
[2:05:20] &gt;&gt; if you were there in that day, you'd
[2:05:22] have seen where Jesus actually was
[2:05:25] searching through the scripture
[2:05:27] &gt;&gt; to find the place
[2:05:29] &gt;&gt; that was speaking of him for that
[2:05:32] moment.
[2:05:34] &gt;&gt; I tell you my friends, God has given us
[2:05:36] a laser guidance into the scripture.
[2:05:40] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:05:41] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:05:42] That's why we never tire of them.
[2:05:44] &gt;&gt; I read you can read revelation
[2:05:47] &gt;&gt; 3 and 14
[2:05:50] where they the message to the Leodysian
[2:05:53] church. You could read it this afternoon
[2:05:56] and then you want to utter a prayer in
[2:05:59] this day and say, "Oh God, I'm so
[2:06:02] thankful I'm not a part of that.
[2:06:05] &gt;&gt; I'm so glad you've delivered me from
[2:06:07] that.
[2:06:10] Amen.
[2:06:11] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:06:20] &gt;&gt; You know, Jesus could have spoke of
[2:06:22] himself out of all the scriptures.
[2:06:30] &gt;&gt; Every scripture in the Bible speaks of
[2:06:33] him. He could have spoken of himself
[2:06:35] from all the scriptures
[2:06:37] &gt;&gt; as he had the two men on the way to
[2:06:39] Emmas and he's speaking to Cleopus. He's
[2:06:43] he's telling them and the Bible says he
[2:06:45] spoke to them out of all the scriptures
[2:06:47] the things concerning himself. But now
[2:06:50] when he stood in the synagogue that day
[2:06:53] and it was delivered to him the the
[2:06:56] scroll of the prophet Isaiah and he
[2:06:58] rolls it out and he's looking until he
[2:07:01] finds the place because it had to be
[2:07:03] that scripture for this very day and
[2:07:06] that same Lord Jesus Christ. Now when
[2:07:09] he's gone his Elijah his spirit of
[2:07:11] Elijah prophet messenger in this time
[2:07:15] and something takes place and he doesn't
[2:07:17] quite he's even anxious over it why I
[2:07:20] couldn't get the scripture this Bible's
[2:07:23] been misprinted and then then a few
[2:07:26] hours later or the next day or so God
[2:07:30] tells him and points him to this
[2:07:32] scripture
[2:07:33] &gt;&gt; and lets him know that's what happened
[2:07:35] again
[2:07:36] &gt;&gt; because it's me back in Luke 4. And it's
[2:07:40] me here in this day.
[2:07:43] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:07:44] [Applause]
[2:07:45] &gt;&gt; And you're witnesses of it.
[2:07:48] &gt;&gt; And you're here
[2:07:50] &gt;&gt; and everyone else
[2:07:52] &gt;&gt; of Christianity. They can read Luke the
[2:07:55] 4th chapter
[2:07:57] &gt;&gt; and they see it and believe that's
[2:07:58] happened to Jesus Christ.
[2:08:00] &gt;&gt; But it's not the God of yesterday.
[2:08:02] &gt;&gt; He's a God of the living. Amen.
[2:08:05] &gt;&gt; Those people who Jesus read the
[2:08:07] scripture to are all in the grave.
[2:08:11] &gt;&gt; He's not the God of those that are gone
[2:08:14] and not the God of history. He's the God
[2:08:16] of the living.
[2:08:20] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[2:08:25] &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham saw in the scriptures
[2:08:28] certain ones he looked at what was to
[2:08:31] happen in this day
[2:08:34] &gt;&gt; and watch closely for the fulfillment in
[2:08:37] the third seal. He said when I see that
[2:08:40] God has promised to do a certain thing
[2:08:42] in this day when he promised to break
[2:08:46] open break off these seals till this
[2:08:49] till this last day and you don't know
[2:08:52] the joy and you don't know the joy and
[2:08:55] the glory when I seen him reveal this
[2:08:58] stand there and watch it happen and know
[2:09:01] that I'll take any person or charge and
[2:09:05] char or charge he never did say one
[2:09:08] thing to us but what had happened that
[2:09:12] way and then to see the joy that's in my
[2:09:15] heart when I see his promise
[2:09:19] &gt;&gt; for this last day
[2:09:24] &gt;&gt; what is he saying what am I saying to
[2:09:26] you listen friends if you don't have a
[2:09:29] joy
[2:09:30] &gt;&gt; from having seeing these things
[2:09:32] happening in your day then you need to
[2:09:34] pray about that to begin with oh God
[2:09:37] restore Pour unto me the joy of my
[2:09:40] salvation.
[2:09:41] Let it let the joy and the glory that
[2:09:44] you gave to the prophet when he saw
[2:09:46] these things happening.
[2:09:51] &gt;&gt; It's this day.
[2:09:54] &gt;&gt; You're alive.
[2:09:56] &gt;&gt; You're here.
[2:09:58] &gt;&gt; You're present.
[2:09:59] &gt;&gt; The Holy Spirit is present.
[2:10:02] &gt;&gt; God is present.
[2:10:03] &gt;&gt; The pillar of fire is here.
[2:10:07] The very pillar of fire that Moses
[2:10:09] talked to
[2:10:10] &gt;&gt; and God spoke through that pillar of
[2:10:12] fire in a burning bush. That pillar of
[2:10:15] fire is here today.
[2:10:18] &gt;&gt; You say, "But where's the burning bush?"
[2:10:20] &gt;&gt; I'm one bush.
[2:10:23] &gt;&gt; You're another bush, Brother Andes.
[2:10:25] &gt;&gt; Are you another bush, Brother Nathan?
[2:10:27] &gt;&gt; Are we flaming bushes
[2:10:31] &gt;&gt; and no man can put the fire out?
[2:10:36] We've been chosen to burn in this time.
[2:10:42] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:10:45] &gt;&gt; Glory to God.
[2:10:46] &gt;&gt; Thank God for burning bushes.
[2:10:50] &gt;&gt; And there's a voice in the bush.
[2:10:52] &gt;&gt; And there's a voice in these bushes.
[2:10:58] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:11:00] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:11:03] The same God
[2:11:05] &gt;&gt; is here in these bushes.
[2:11:07] [Applause]
[2:11:09] &gt;&gt; Do you believe it?
[2:11:11] &gt;&gt; And you can't put it out.
[2:11:13] &gt;&gt; You might say, "Well, I don't feel that
[2:11:15] fire." You stay here today and you will
[2:11:17] feel that fire.
[2:11:22] I remember when
[2:11:24] &gt;&gt; brother Milo Ravar, God bless him when
[2:11:26] he got when he met this fire and it
[2:11:29] began to flame in his own soul
[2:11:32] &gt;&gt; and he's in the airlines of purser and
[2:11:34] for the airlines and they're serving
[2:11:37] liquor and he doesn't want to serve
[2:11:38] liquor let the girls do it and they're
[2:11:41] coming with their shag hair. He felt so
[2:11:44] sorry for him. They used to look good to
[2:11:46] him.
[2:11:48] Excuse me, brother Milco.
[2:11:51] But now they look like he said, "Look,
[2:11:55] you look like you a dog that's had a
[2:11:57] bath."
[2:12:03] &gt;&gt; And then the union
[2:12:05] &gt;&gt; and and the and the the management said,
[2:12:10] "Shut it off." He said, "I can't find
[2:12:13] the stop button. It's getting me into so
[2:12:16] much trouble. Show me the stop button so
[2:12:18] I can push it. But nobody could find the
[2:12:20] stop button. He couldn't find the stop
[2:12:22] button. There is no stop button on this
[2:12:25] bush. There's a burning bush.
[2:12:29] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen in the balcony?
[2:12:32] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:12:33] &gt;&gt; You say, "Oh, you're just enthused,
[2:12:35] brother Biscll." You're right. I am
[2:12:37] enthused. Amen.
[2:12:42] &gt;&gt; I thought of Caleb this morning
[2:12:44] &gt;&gt; and I even said when he was in his 80s,
[2:12:46] 85 or something and 40 years before, he
[2:12:50] said, "My strength is not diminished."
[2:12:53] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Give me this mountain.
[2:12:56] &gt;&gt; I say, "Give me the resurrection.
[2:12:59] &gt;&gt; Give me the rapture."
[2:13:03] [Applause]
[2:13:06] We got the best thing on earth.
[2:13:10] &gt;&gt; Did you hear Vancouver has the Olympics?
[2:13:14] &gt;&gt; Someone might rise as high as get on a
[2:13:16] pedestal. I'm going higher.
[2:13:19] &gt;&gt; We're going higher than some pedestal
[2:13:23] &gt;&gt; to have a gold medal around their neck.
[2:13:25] I got the gold of Christ's character
[2:13:28] inside this meeting.
[2:13:30] Hallelujah.
[2:13:32] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:13:32] &gt;&gt; The gift from God,
[2:13:34] &gt;&gt; not from some Olympic committee.
[2:13:37] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[2:13:40] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[2:13:50] &gt;&gt; What is promised for this day? I've got
[2:13:52] to quit.
[2:13:53] &gt;&gt; But what is promised for this day? If
[2:13:55] you want something interesting, go and
[2:13:57] punch it in your computer and just punch
[2:14:00] this in with italics on both sides. The
[2:14:04] bride will
[2:14:06] &gt;&gt; Thank you, my friend.
[2:14:09] &gt;&gt; The bride will.
[2:14:11] &gt;&gt; Can I just give you a few?
[2:14:14] &gt;&gt; The bride will
[2:14:16] &gt;&gt; when not yesterday, today.
[2:14:20] The bride will be called out
[2:14:23] &gt;&gt; during this time.
[2:14:25] &gt;&gt; Can you say, "I've been called out."
[2:14:28] &gt;&gt; Not yesterday. Not in history. I've been
[2:14:30] called out.
[2:14:34] &gt;&gt; The bride will be a lovely lady.
[2:14:37] &gt;&gt; I don't have to tell you how nice you
[2:14:39] are. Elijah told you how nice you are.
[2:14:43] The bride will be a lovely lady,
[2:14:47] &gt;&gt; a lady of the word,
[2:14:49] &gt;&gt; unadulterated,
[2:14:51] not touched by any man's organization
[2:14:54] and any man-made theory.
[2:14:57] &gt;&gt; Thank God.
[2:14:59] &gt;&gt; And you don't need to say just the
[2:15:00] bride's a lovely lady. You have to say
[2:15:03] yourself.
[2:15:06] [Music]
[2:15:08] &gt;&gt; I'm a masterpiece.
[2:15:10] &gt;&gt; He said I'm a masterpiece. Amen.
[2:15:13] &gt;&gt; I'm a lovely lady
[2:15:15] &gt;&gt; of the bride of Jesus Christ.
[2:15:17] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:15:18] &gt;&gt; The bride will know her husband.
[2:15:23] &gt;&gt; We're not going to sit there and kind of
[2:15:25] &gt;&gt; uh what's that about the word?
[2:15:28] &gt;&gt; No. No. When she hears things about him
[2:15:34] &gt;&gt; and and a prophet said something else
[2:15:36] and I love it. I keep it as a phrase.
[2:15:39] It's branded in my mind.
[2:15:42] The bride is attracted to the
[2:15:46] bridegroom.
[2:15:49] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:15:50] &gt;&gt; When you say this is this is what the
[2:15:53] this is what the word of God says. This
[2:15:55] is the unveiling of him by his
[2:15:58] messenger.
[2:15:59] &gt;&gt; And then you look at it and people won't
[2:16:02] have a downcast and say, "Isn't that
[2:16:03] wonderful?"
[2:16:06] She'll be attracted to the bridegroom.
[2:16:11] &gt;&gt; The bride will be the flesh
[2:16:13] &gt;&gt; and bones
[2:16:15] &gt;&gt; of Jesus Christ.
[2:16:20] &gt;&gt; Is this just a statement on paper?
[2:16:23] &gt;&gt; Are these just some words that spoken
[2:16:25] out of William Brandon's mouth
[2:16:27] &gt;&gt; or did this come as thus sayeth the Lord
[2:16:29] to you?
[2:16:30] &gt;&gt; Do you receive it as a message from
[2:16:32] Jesus Christ?
[2:16:34] That's exactly what he said about you.
[2:16:37] You're the flesh and bones
[2:16:39] &gt;&gt; of Jesus Christ.
[2:16:43] &gt;&gt; It'll take on new meaning when you hear,
[2:16:46] &gt;&gt; "I'm the body of Jesus Christ."
[2:16:51] &gt;&gt; You will walk different.
[2:16:55] &gt;&gt; You'll feel different.
[2:16:58] &gt;&gt; Lord,
[2:16:59] &gt;&gt; you will be different.
[2:17:05] Praise God.
[2:17:09] &gt;&gt; The bride
[2:17:11] &gt;&gt; that fell into the ground at Naa has
[2:17:16] come back to original word grain again.
[2:17:21] [Music]
[2:17:23] &gt;&gt; And now going to close in a few moments.
[2:17:26] The bride will say
[2:17:31] &gt;&gt; the bride will say
[2:17:33] the spirit and the prophet and the bride
[2:17:35] will be saying the same thing.
[2:17:38] &gt;&gt; He said the authenticated prophet of God
[2:17:41] who appears in this last age what he
[2:17:44] says from God the bride will say
[2:17:49] &gt;&gt; she'll say the same thing.
[2:17:54] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:17:56] If you hear someone else punching
[2:17:57] something else, this is what I think or
[2:17:59] this is what we think. Don't give a
[2:18:01] second moment to it.
[2:18:03] &gt;&gt; Your mind is too valuable. It's a womb
[2:18:06] for the word of God.
[2:18:09] &gt;&gt; What the authenticated prophet has said,
[2:18:11] the bride will say,
[2:18:15] [Applause]
[2:18:16] &gt;&gt; we can surely say amen to that.
[2:18:22] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:18:23] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen.
[2:18:26] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:18:27] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:18:28] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[2:18:29] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:18:34] &gt;&gt; The bride will be married to Jesus
[2:18:36] Christ.
[2:18:38] &gt;&gt; They and the bride will be so much like
[2:18:40] him,
[2:18:41] &gt;&gt; they will even be in his very image.
[2:18:44] &gt;&gt; The bride will be caught away.
[2:18:46] &gt;&gt; The bride will be caught away.
[2:18:49] &gt;&gt; She's not going to be on the phone
[2:18:51] asking, "What did Brother Brham say
[2:18:52] about the earthquake?
[2:18:55] not going to be saying, "What did he say
[2:18:57] about this or what did he say about
[2:18:58] that?"
[2:18:59] &gt;&gt; The bride will be caught away.
[2:19:02] &gt;&gt; All you have to do is rest in that.
[2:19:05] &gt;&gt; He said it.
[2:19:06] &gt;&gt; We believe it.
[2:19:08] &gt;&gt; And that settles it.
[2:19:10] &gt;&gt; The bride
[2:19:12] &gt;&gt; will be caught away.
[2:19:14] [Music]
[2:19:14] [Applause]
[2:19:15] [Music]
[2:19:17] &gt;&gt; Don't miss it.
[2:19:19] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:19:21] Amen.
[2:19:21] &gt;&gt; You'll be taking a step one day perhaps.
[2:19:24] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:19:25] &gt;&gt; You may be sitting at a table. You may
[2:19:27] be at your work
[2:19:30] &gt;&gt; and you'll take one step
[2:19:33] &gt;&gt; at a time
[2:19:35] &gt;&gt; right into eternity. Brother Brandham
[2:19:37] said when he was taken beyond the
[2:19:39] curtain of time and that was actually
[2:19:40] like a translation,
[2:19:42] &gt;&gt; he told me with his own lips. He said,
[2:19:44] "Brother Eddie,
[2:19:46] &gt;&gt; he said, "I I was laying right there."
[2:19:50] He said, "I had my hands behind my
[2:19:52] head." And he said, "I was just saying,
[2:19:55] well,
[2:19:57] Bill Brandham, if you're going to do
[2:19:59] anything for God, you're now 52. If
[2:20:02] you're going to do anything for God, you
[2:20:03] better get up and get going." said just
[2:20:06] then
[2:20:08] one stood beside the bed
[2:20:11] &gt;&gt; said I've come to show you things that
[2:20:12] you've asked about
[2:20:14] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah
[2:20:14] &gt;&gt; things you've questioned and wanted to
[2:20:16] know
[2:20:17] &gt;&gt; he says there was no sensation of
[2:20:19] movement
[2:20:20] &gt;&gt; I was immediately
[2:20:22] &gt;&gt; standing looking at my body
[2:20:24] &gt;&gt; from maybe 20 ft away
[2:20:26] &gt;&gt; I was still sitting there
[2:20:27] &gt;&gt; still sitting there leaning against the
[2:20:29] wall with hands behind his head
[2:20:31] &gt;&gt; he said and immediately instantly no
[2:20:33] feeling no sensation
[2:20:35] Yes sir.
[2:20:36] &gt;&gt; He said then he looked and here was here
[2:20:38] was a millions of people
[2:20:40] &gt;&gt; looked like to him
[2:20:41] &gt;&gt; and he saw the ladies first
[2:20:48] &gt;&gt; when he said another place I saw you all
[2:20:50] there
[2:20:52] &gt;&gt; I want to say to our sisters
[2:20:55] &gt;&gt; maybe you were part of that number
[2:20:59] &gt;&gt; and they come running
[2:21:02] &gt;&gt; to him. Isn't this amazing? And they
[2:21:04] said, "Our brother, our precious
[2:21:06] brother."
[2:21:07] &gt;&gt; And then the men came.
[2:21:09] &gt;&gt; And our brother, our precious brother.
[2:21:12] &gt;&gt; And brother Brandham is saying to the
[2:21:14] one that's with him, "Who are these?"
[2:21:17] &gt;&gt; He said, "These are your people."
[2:21:19] &gt;&gt; He said, "Are brands?"
[2:21:21] &gt;&gt; No. He said, "The ones you've won to
[2:21:24] Christ."
[2:21:26] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:21:28] &gt;&gt; Multitudes of them.
[2:21:32] He said, "Brother Eddie, I bit my
[2:21:34] finger."
[2:21:36] &gt;&gt; He said, "I pinched my hand."
[2:21:38] &gt;&gt; And I felt for my hair. And he says,
[2:21:42] "All my hair, my head was full of hair
[2:21:44] again."
[2:21:46] &gt;&gt; Oh.
[2:21:47] &gt;&gt; He said, "It's very much like this."
[2:21:49] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[2:21:50] &gt;&gt; Beautiful wilderness of northern
[2:21:53] &gt;&gt; British Columbia.
[2:21:55] &gt;&gt; He said, and that's why he said to the
[2:21:58] people, I can never be the same.
[2:22:00] &gt;&gt; Amen. William Brandham again.
[2:22:02] &gt;&gt; There's nothing to fear. He always
[2:22:04] wondered. He wondered if there'd be like
[2:22:06] a a mist go by and he wondered if that's
[2:22:08] brother Neville and he wouldn't have a
[2:22:10] hand that I could shake cuz his hand is
[2:22:12] there in the grave and and rotted away.
[2:22:16] But here they're not in the tomb.
[2:22:18] They're not in a grave. They're living
[2:22:20] person.
[2:22:21] [Applause]
[2:22:23] &gt;&gt; Another body.
[2:22:25] &gt;&gt; He told you about the body and he told
[2:22:27] you about the place. He's not a God of
[2:22:29] the dead.
[2:22:30] &gt;&gt; He's a God of the living.
[2:22:34] [Applause]
[2:22:37] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:22:39] &gt;&gt; And he said some other words,
[2:22:43] whatever you do,
[2:22:45] don't miss it.
[2:22:54] &gt;&gt; Let's pray for one another.
[2:22:56] We don't want to miss it.
[2:23:03] &gt;&gt; What shall a man do if he gain the whole
[2:23:05] world
[2:23:06] &gt;&gt; and lose his own soul? What do you want?
[2:23:08] Never want to miss it. If you're here,
[2:23:12] young person and hanging in the balance,
[2:23:16] don't hang any longer.
[2:23:19] &gt;&gt; Don't miss it.
[2:23:21] &gt;&gt; Cast the world aside. Cast all your
[2:23:24] ambitions aside.
[2:23:26] &gt;&gt; Cast all your wants and all your uh
[2:23:29] whatever it might be. Just cast it aside
[2:23:32] &gt;&gt; because there nothing is worthy of
[2:23:35] missing that moment.
[2:23:37] &gt;&gt; I've had people say to me, "Well, I I'll
[2:23:40] just, you know, I'll I'll go through the
[2:23:42] great tribulation. If you can't stand
[2:23:45] now, you'll never stand then."
[2:23:49] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:23:50] &gt;&gt; That's the truth.
[2:23:52] [Music]
[2:24:02] Can I close with some potent words,
[2:24:05] please?
[2:24:11] He's talking about everything
[2:24:14] of Christianity and those that claim. He
[2:24:18] said, "Now it's began to pull away.
[2:24:21] The wheat has begun to be seen.
[2:24:24] This is not a Pentecostal age.
[2:24:28] &gt;&gt; This is the latter day age.
[2:24:32] &gt;&gt; This is the bride age.
[2:24:34] &gt;&gt; This is the evening light.
[2:24:36] &gt;&gt; This is when Malachi 4 must be fulfilled
[2:24:39] to follow God's pattern.
[2:24:42] &gt;&gt; This is Luke 17:30 to be fulfilled. This
[2:24:45] is the book of Jeremiah and all the rest
[2:24:48] of them that Joel has spoke of these
[2:24:51] days. This is that day.
[2:24:55] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:24:56] &gt;&gt; I've heard Lord that it was coming, but
[2:25:00] now I see it with my eye.
[2:25:03] &gt;&gt; See, the day might be this 20 might be
[2:25:05] this 24-hour period. I think of the
[2:25:08] people that, you know, they've they've
[2:25:09] seized upon a certain opportunity.
[2:25:12] Brother Brandham talks about the woman.
[2:25:14] Excuse me for taking just a few more
[2:25:16] minutes. He talks about the woman. I sat
[2:25:18] real close to him when he was talking
[2:25:20] about the woman that washed his feet
[2:25:22] with her tears.
[2:25:25] I have never seen such an expression of
[2:25:28] emotion. He was weeping so hard. His
[2:25:31] face was just reened, beat red. And he
[2:25:35] kissed his hand. And he was going
[2:25:41] depicting how she kissed his feet.
[2:25:44] friends, that was not what people
[2:25:47] regularly do when a guest, honored guest
[2:25:50] is invited for supper.
[2:25:53] &gt;&gt; She wasn't interested in
[2:25:56] what was proper
[2:25:59] &gt;&gt; and what was right.
[2:26:01] &gt;&gt; I've seen people in a service
[2:26:03] &gt;&gt; and the spirit of God would fall upon
[2:26:06] them
[2:26:07] &gt;&gt; and they might do something irregular,
[2:26:10] &gt;&gt; but it was so pure. It was so holy
[2:26:14] &gt;&gt; and everybody knew it was God because
[2:26:16] that person would never do such a thing
[2:26:20] if if they in their own in their own
[2:26:22] self. This woman brother Ben Brandham
[2:26:24] describes he said she saw him sitting
[2:26:26] there. She saw him with dirty feet. She
[2:26:29] saw him unwelcomed and she said this
[2:26:32] isn't right. Somehow it's not right.
[2:26:35] Amen.
[2:26:39] &gt;&gt; If I was in a church,
[2:26:42] even if I was the pastor of a church and
[2:26:45] they had zero interest and they fought
[2:26:48] against and resisted anything uh any
[2:26:52] effort, any attempt to speak to others
[2:26:55] or to let others or to translate the
[2:26:58] message or to use any means possible,
[2:27:01] whether it be cleaning the tapes as we
[2:27:04] were all these years ago and duplicating
[2:27:06] them and making even making cassettes so
[2:27:10] we could put the prophet's words on and
[2:27:13] sending them out over the radio or
[2:27:15] sending them anywhere we could. My
[2:27:18] brother, my sister, if God blesses a
[2:27:21] life or blesses a church, he'll do it
[2:27:23] for that. If I wasn't amongst a group of
[2:27:25] people that believed in that,
[2:27:28] &gt;&gt; don't worry about you leaving me. I'd
[2:27:30] leave you.
[2:27:33] I'm interested in people that have the
[2:27:34] same vision and the same burden and the
[2:27:38] same zeal.
[2:27:39] &gt;&gt; Tell me what's wrong with zeal.
[2:27:42] &gt;&gt; I'm not asking you like an athlete to
[2:27:45] get up at 5 in the morning or 4 in the
[2:27:47] morning and be at the gym at 6:00 and
[2:27:49] work yourself out till you're in a total
[2:27:51] sweat and almost wasted of your energy
[2:27:53] and eat this kind of food to do that.
[2:27:56] Not today and not this week, this month,
[2:27:59] this whole year. and maybe years of your
[2:28:02] life. Listen friends, this isn't a myth.
[2:28:04] This isn't a story. Vancouver's full of
[2:28:06] them right now.
[2:28:08] &gt;&gt; And people who put an incredibly more
[2:28:11] importance on some fleshly natural uh uh
[2:28:16] pride. I don't know what it is. I'm not
[2:28:18] opposed to them. I'm just saying that we
[2:28:21] as believers,
[2:28:22] &gt;&gt; we as believers, we have a greater
[2:28:24] cause.
[2:28:26] &gt;&gt; We have a greater reward.
[2:28:28] We have a greater call.
[2:28:35] [Music]
[2:28:36] [Applause]
[2:28:39] [Music]
[2:28:46] I'm going to close now, but I'm going to
[2:28:48] close with this statement.
[2:28:57] Brother Brandon went to great lengths
[2:29:00] to describe for the people that God
[2:29:04] chooses
[2:29:05] a person or he may choose
[2:29:08] an individual
[2:29:11] to be a channel
[2:29:14] and then he describes how a prophet is
[2:29:17] even born in a certain way
[2:29:20] &gt;&gt; because he is a channel. Amen.
[2:29:22] &gt;&gt; And the last two, three services, I've
[2:29:25] used the phrase the prophet channel,
[2:29:28] &gt;&gt; not a history channel, not a discovery
[2:29:31] channel, but a prophet channel.
[2:29:34] &gt;&gt; And you have to you have to turn it and
[2:29:37] get onto that channel.
[2:29:39] &gt;&gt; And God raised up a prophet who was the
[2:29:43] channel
[2:29:44] &gt;&gt; and people could say what they wanted to
[2:29:46] say. And they did
[2:29:48] &gt;&gt; and people used him
[2:29:50] &gt;&gt; and people abused him. But it never
[2:29:53] changed the channel.
[2:29:55] &gt;&gt; People resisted it. People blackened his
[2:29:58] name. They tried to do everything to
[2:30:00] destroy him and to destroy the work.
[2:30:03] Hey, we were here a handful of people. I
[2:30:06] know what it's all about. I'm telling
[2:30:08] you. I'm telling you with all my heart.
[2:30:10] We were here eight or 10 people sitting
[2:30:12] on rough unplained planks for benches on
[2:30:16] blocks of wood and I was the president
[2:30:18] of a company. I was respected by banks
[2:30:21] as an appraiser and yet and my and my on
[2:30:24] Sunday and and Tuesday and on Friday
[2:30:27] we're sitting there with young people,
[2:30:29] &gt;&gt; former drug addicts and whatever more.
[2:30:32] You've heard them testify.
[2:30:38] And I sat there because I believed in
[2:30:41] this message.
[2:30:42] &gt;&gt; And I believed that the message was the
[2:30:45] only thing that could change these young
[2:30:47] people.
[2:30:49] &gt;&gt; And we sat there with a handful of
[2:30:51] people.
[2:30:52] &gt;&gt; Eight or 10 people.
[2:30:58] All I can tell you
[2:31:00] is if I had to do it again, I'd do it
[2:31:02] exactly I would do it again.
[2:31:06] &gt;&gt; God was in it. Amen.
[2:31:11] &gt;&gt; Some of them heard it in school, didn't
[2:31:13] they, Karen?
[2:31:16] &gt;&gt; I'll never forget. You've seen Sister
[2:31:18] Karen. You know what she is. I just
[2:31:21] Sister Karen came with Joanne into our
[2:31:23] home, walked in a pair of jeans. I'm not
[2:31:25] saying that to embarrass her. That was a
[2:31:27] thing for young ladies to do. She's in a
[2:31:29] pair of jeans, sat at our table, and I
[2:31:33] just began to speak to her and went
[2:31:34] right into the serpent seed. Wasn't
[2:31:38] me that revealed it.
[2:31:41] &gt;&gt; God,
[2:31:43] &gt;&gt; not of yesterday.
[2:31:44] &gt;&gt; She begin to realize there's a God.
[2:31:47] &gt;&gt; There's a living person.
[2:31:49] &gt;&gt; This Bible says something that's
[2:31:51] relevant now.
[2:31:55] &gt;&gt; Not back there.
[2:31:59] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:32:01] &gt;&gt; I just feel a pull.
[2:32:04] I feel a real strong pull. And I know I
[2:32:07] know that you would never dispute or you
[2:32:09] wouldn't even disregard the fact that
[2:32:13] the prophet's a channel.
[2:32:15] &gt;&gt; But do you know what he said?
[2:32:17] &gt;&gt; He said you,
[2:32:19] &gt;&gt; the bride of Jesus Christ, is the
[2:32:22] channel.
[2:32:24] &gt;&gt; You are now the channel.
[2:32:26] &gt;&gt; His voice is still and he is not here,
[2:32:29] but you are here. God's a God of the
[2:32:32] living.
[2:32:35] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:32:36] &gt;&gt; And you are the channel.
[2:32:39] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:32:40] &gt;&gt; And you're the one to whom it's
[2:32:41] committed
[2:32:43] &gt;&gt; this gospel
[2:32:44] &gt;&gt; of Jesus Christ. Live it, speak it,
[2:32:48] &gt;&gt; present it, however. But God has chosen
[2:32:51] you
[2:32:53] &gt;&gt; and he's said further
[2:32:55] &gt;&gt; that you're the voice,
[2:32:58] &gt;&gt; the final voice. Amen.
[2:33:01] &gt;&gt; The final voice
[2:33:03] &gt;&gt; to the final age.
[2:33:05] [Music]
[2:33:11] &gt;&gt; Why do you teach, brother Phillip?
[2:33:15] Do you expect the students to hear you?
[2:33:21] You expect them to remember
[2:33:24] what you've studied and prepared for
[2:33:26] them?
[2:33:28] I would hope so.
[2:33:30] And I would hope that your students
[2:33:35] would do that and be benefited.
[2:33:38] That's what teachers do.
[2:33:41] &gt;&gt; That's what preachers do.
[2:33:46] &gt;&gt; I believe Philip believes it. I believe
[2:33:47] Brother Terry John. I believe Sister
[2:33:50] Ramon and Sister Jenny. believe that
[2:33:51] they I believe that ministers
[2:33:55] &gt;&gt; and we don't want to ever get to be the
[2:33:57] place where he says and I said a little
[2:34:00] while ago, oh my oh my, I hope you stay
[2:34:02] with me just a few more moments. I'm
[2:34:04] going to close. But he said preachers
[2:34:06] will preach for a
[2:34:10] bread ticket
[2:34:13] &gt;&gt; for a living.
[2:34:14] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[2:34:16] And so they fit the gospel
[2:34:19] &gt;&gt; to fit their situation.
[2:34:22] &gt;&gt; That's not what we're here for.
[2:34:25] &gt;&gt; We study the word, the whole word, the
[2:34:27] whole council of God, and bring it to
[2:34:29] the people. This is what has been said.
[2:34:32] This is a message for this hour. And now
[2:34:34] we're preaching it not just to live
[2:34:37] somehow a better life. We want to show
[2:34:39] the scriptures that have unfolded and
[2:34:41] the scriptures that are being unfolded
[2:34:43] as of this time and what he said the
[2:34:46] bride is. Then I want to say to you this
[2:34:49] is what she is.
[2:34:51] &gt;&gt; What he said the bride will do. I want
[2:34:53] to repeat it. This is what the bride
[2:34:55] will do.
[2:34:58] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:34:59] &gt;&gt; Whether I see it or whether I feel it is
[2:35:01] irrelevant.
[2:35:02] &gt;&gt; This is what she will do.
[2:35:04] &gt;&gt; You will do it
[2:35:06] &gt;&gt; as a people. You will do it.
[2:35:11] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:35:13] &gt;&gt; I thank the Lord for it.
[2:35:16] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:35:27] &gt;&gt; So everything that God has spoken his
[2:35:29] word
[2:35:31] received into the right channel.
[2:35:33] &gt;&gt; Yes sir.
[2:35:35] &gt;&gt; Will
[2:35:36] &gt;&gt; Amen. will materialize that word.
[2:35:40] [Music]
[2:35:42] &gt;&gt; The promise of God,
[2:35:44] &gt;&gt; not in theology, but the promise of God
[2:35:46] in the right channel.
[2:35:48] &gt;&gt; I'm closing, friends. He has declared
[2:35:52] &gt;&gt; and there cannot be a higher authority.
[2:35:55] &gt;&gt; There's never been a voice so vindicated
[2:35:57] as this voice. God, how can we forget?
[2:36:01] How can we even even question it? It
[2:36:04] says, "And they doubted back there." And
[2:36:06] so we're not doubting.
[2:36:08] &gt;&gt; We're saying, "Lord, I believe
[2:36:12] &gt;&gt; this is a scripture for this day.
[2:36:14] &gt;&gt; If you will hear his voice
[2:36:16] &gt;&gt; today,
[2:36:18] &gt;&gt; if you will hear his voice,
[2:36:20] &gt;&gt; harden not your heart." So he has said
[2:36:23] the channel is the bride of Jesus Christ
[2:36:26] and the promise of God in the right
[2:36:29] channel
[2:36:30] &gt;&gt; will cause that promise to materialize.
[2:36:37] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:36:38] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:36:40] &gt;&gt; And I say this is the right word.
[2:36:43] &gt;&gt; It came by the right messenger.
[2:36:45] &gt;&gt; It came in our day.
[2:36:47] &gt;&gt; It came for this people. And we are that
[2:36:50] people.
[2:36:51] &gt;&gt; We've been called out
[2:36:53] &gt;&gt; and we responded
[2:36:55] &gt;&gt; and we were married to him.
[2:36:57] &gt;&gt; We are the channel.
[2:37:00] [Applause]
[2:37:07] &gt;&gt; Friend, what is the wife of a husband
[2:37:09] for?
[2:37:10] &gt;&gt; She's the channel
[2:37:11] &gt;&gt; for his seed.
[2:37:13] &gt;&gt; She receives his seed
[2:37:15] &gt;&gt; and she brings forth his image. And the
[2:37:18] prophet said further, that's why she was
[2:37:19] given to the husband to the man that she
[2:37:22] might bring forth his seed
[2:37:24] &gt;&gt; or his image.
[2:37:30] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:37:35] &gt;&gt; Said if she would refuse his seed,
[2:37:38] &gt;&gt; she should be put away.
[2:37:40] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[2:37:41] &gt;&gt; Why? Because she refusing to bring forth
[2:37:43] his image. Amen.
[2:37:45] &gt;&gt; And that's why it says, "Harden not your
[2:37:47] hearts
[2:37:48] &gt;&gt; as it was in the day of the
[2:37:49] provocation."
[2:37:51] &gt;&gt; In other words, open your heart. Open
[2:37:53] the womb of your mind. Say, "God, what
[2:37:55] you're speaking, I believe it.
[2:37:57] &gt;&gt; I haven't figured it out, but I believe
[2:37:59] it.
[2:38:00] &gt;&gt; I may not understand it, but I believe
[2:38:02] it."
[2:38:03] &gt;&gt; And the promise of the word in this
[2:38:05] channel will cause it to materialize.
[2:38:09] &gt;&gt; Say, "I I want I need a deeper life in
[2:38:11] Christ. I need to be changed. I need to
[2:38:14] be transformed. That's what this word
[2:38:16] came to do.
[2:38:18] &gt;&gt; Forgive me for taking up so much time.
[2:38:20] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:38:21] &gt;&gt; Amen. Let's stand, shall we?
[2:38:25] &gt;&gt; I thank you for your sincerity and I
[2:38:28] thank you for allowing me this time.
[2:38:31] &gt;&gt; You forgive me
[2:38:34] &gt;&gt; if I need to be. I want to sing a happy
[2:38:37] song. I want to sing a song that is from
[2:38:40] the scriptures. This is the day
[2:38:44] &gt;&gt; that the Lord hath made
[2:38:46] &gt;&gt; and we will be glad
[2:38:48] &gt;&gt; and rejoice in it.
[2:38:50] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.

[2:44:40] star? You all have, I'm sure.
[2:44:45] &gt;&gt; It's a beautiful sight, isn't it?
[2:44:49] Well, the prophet of God, he preaches
[2:44:51] watchmen one of the night
[2:44:55] and he tells us tells you tells me the
[2:44:59] evening star that was here in the
[2:45:02] evening time.
[2:45:04] &gt;&gt; This this very one that was here was the
[2:45:07] evening star.
[2:45:09] &gt;&gt; And then he says in another place, the
[2:45:11] evening star and the morning star are
[2:45:14] the same star.
[2:45:18] They're the same star
[2:45:20] &gt;&gt; and one's announcing that the evening is
[2:45:23] here.
[2:45:24] &gt;&gt; That's why the evening and the morning
[2:45:27] &gt;&gt; was the first day.
[2:45:29] &gt;&gt; Evening and the morning.
[2:45:31] &gt;&gt; And in the evening time,
[2:45:33] &gt;&gt; we had an evening star. Declared a
[2:45:36] message for the evening time.
[2:45:39] &gt;&gt; But before the resurrection came, he had
[2:45:41] to announce
[2:45:43] &gt;&gt; the sun is rising.
