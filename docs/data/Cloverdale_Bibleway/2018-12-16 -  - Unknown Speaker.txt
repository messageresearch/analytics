is requesting prayer for herself she has diverticulitis and is in a lot of pain and discomfort just asking that the Lord would touch her desires not to go for surgery God's been merciful in our family over many years she had appendicitis the doctor was ready to go in for surgery and just after she got saved and she said just check one more time doctor went in and checked and he said how did you get a brand brand-new appendant appendix it looks like a newborn's amen that's our God he can do things just like that so she's just asking one more time amen if you have a need upon your heart as we go to prayer this morning brother Tim [Music] physical needs this morning certainly our burden for those you know the body is not just a local body it's a international worldwide body and there are many needs we are a needy body as long as we're in these mortal bodies we'll be a needy body we're looking forward to a body change and God is doing great things to get his bride ready for that tonight before we go to prayer just want to say that we've just published the latest edition of the believers faith Challenge report and it will be hitting the mail this week thanks to brother Matthew in his outreach group they'll be doing a work effort this week to put it in the mail we mail thousands of these around the world and the people that are interested in them and you can get your copy before anybody else does they're on the back table by the office and there's some unique articles in here we have one we were actually hoping to have brother Jason Jackson with us from Arkansas here just last month but he got pulled aside because of the hurricane that they had down there in Florida and he went to have some meet with some and help some family members but he helped us to put an article together of the impact of his church sponsoring a print station in Angola and that is such a unique article you'll want to read that personally it has had a huge impact on their church I won't I won't give you any spoilers as they say the Uganda what's happening in Uganda is in here usually we published one or two pages per we could say project or per item and you get for Uganda we went to four pages in this in this magazine and and there's a lot of detail and pictures in there that you'll enjoy reading about China and what's happening in China and some of the details brother Murphy couldn't necessarily share over the internet they're in there in the faith Challenge report greetings from our pastor what's happening on the message up many other things you want to get your copy and you'll be inspired by it that's what it's called the faith challenge report it'll challenge your faith amen we want our faith challenge you know faith has to have a challenge in order to operate if there's no need there's no need for faith amen and but we thank God that he challenges us and puts a pressure to our faith but he gives us a faith to overcome the challenge and let's believe together not just for what's happening overseas but let's believe together this morning as we pray especially for these individual needs I don't know if you felt that way as brother Derrick was reading them I felt that these were people that really needed a touch from God and let's bow our heads together and if you need also a need a touch from God have a desire in your heart why don't you just make that known before the Lord a wonderful Heavenly Father you are our God we are your people we are not ashamed to be called your people Oh Lord we are called mrs.

[Music] god bless you this is my story also all the day long and I have another story I'd like to just sing a wee bit about he came to me when I could not go to him he came to me and I trust that would be your experience today I stood right about where Thomas sitting and we were singing he came to me I remember even looking up in the balcony over to this side I don't know why I just looked over there and I said yes you came to me you came to me in my element you came to me and in the wilderness as it were and you came to me there you came to me in a profit and you answered many questions you came to me and like you if you would stand if you wouldn't mind and just sing that and I'd like your thought to be upon that very thought perhaps this is the moment he would just come to me in a special way lets us say him [Music] [Music] have you singing I'll have you sing once again with me and rather than singing it like a lullaby we'll say it like a song like putting words to your putting music to your words he came to me he came to me when I could not come to where he was he came to me saying it like a like an event in your life would you do maybe you want to close your eyes and just think about that I'm just wanting to create that kind of an atmosphere say your brother [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] now his prey a moment please our Heavenly Father we're indebted forever then you came to us when you came our life was changed our life was transformed by the transforming power which we could not even begin to comprehend but you have done it and we've gathered here this morning for various reasons perhaps some say well it's Sunday and we always go to church but may it be more than that may it become a time when we come and speak to you and you speak to us may it be a time the old God that this will be a house of prayer a house of communicating with you Heavenly Father bless your word now and now we pray that we'll be worthy to read your words things that you've spoken things that were in your heart things that you had intended shall be and they shall be Oh God whether we see it or do not see it they shall be thy will be done on earth as it is in heaven we speak O Lord to you as our Father we pray your will be done in Jesus name Amen anointest Lord we pray amen well you enjoyed I'm sure brother God's comments about faith challenge report well I haven't read it yet I'm certainly going to read it and I trust you be blessed this week as you ponder the things that God has for us made this Sunday be a Sunday are we different from others I just pray that you will have a testimony such as I had just a moment ago I maybe just said it quickly I was standing where brother Thomas sitting and I was standing and I was just singing he came to me it was just another course but that day it was a different course that day it was different words and I don't even know if the author of this song felt what I felt thought that day he came remember when he looked at you saw you what did he see in you and so I I pray that today will be a blessed time in his presence amen amen I'll have you take your Bible and because I'm going to be speaking from I'm going to speak from the old creation and the new creation our first birth and our second birth and why believers even believers have a lot of trouble have a lot of difficulty because we're living in both places at the same time that's and brother Ernie you lead a wonderful foundation for that on Wednesday it was really wonderful someone was asking me I was smiling of course I was smiling through the whole time I just enjoyed I enjoyed the word real a whole lot is what I'll say and a few a few weeks ago brother Tom preached the series and I don't know if you caught it as in a series but he started on the theme here ye him and and the second service he spoke on those that heard him said but blessed are your ears for they hear for the things they hear and your eyes for the things a lot of people could see physically but they weren't seeing what they were given to see and then I think the third service was and you'll just forgive me Tom if I'm not exactly on cue here but I think the third service was that you could see and you could hear even if you wanted to you could see in here only by his grace and by his predestinated and you'll only see in here what you hunger and really hunger after today it won't it's God's not going to force it down your throat it's something you will need to hunger for you desire for you think about it you ponder it and you think about his greatness and your unworthiness and when you see things in a in the light that they really are and I'm just seeking to prepare you for what I have further to say amen and then in that third service the the last service at least whether it was the third or fourth service it was that we we are predestinated to a certain purpose and God does he opens our eyes causes us to see causes us to hear because it is to direct our life in a certain pre-planned direction and God has his intent in fact is that's why you were perhaps some of you may be born in the home you were born in he wanted you to hear certain things perhaps others of you worked with someone who you worked with a colleague or you ran into somebody and they just casually said something to you and it just that was different and you followed on or you got invited to church this this is a church it's not a church Church this is just a building that we come we come to hear the word of God we come to let the Holy Spirit have his way and that's the whole desire and failing that we fail completely there's all kinds of churches all kinds of buildings their monuments is what they are and we don't want this to be just a monument we don't want this just to be a formality if there's just a formality to you as to the Holy Spirit Jarre me from that jar me out of that and let me know that I'm here for a divine purpose for Tomita to have of a divine meeting with the Holy One of Israel amen god bless you now with I'll just have you take your Bibles if you would if you don't have a Bible shared with one right next to you because I like you to read from John the seventeenth chapter and the eleventh to the sixteenth verse and while you're turning I might as well say this to you because that came to my mind today and I said father let me be worthy to read these words this was not just some printed words on a page this is the prayer of Jesus Christ we're not worthy to even read it cause us to be worthy and it's a conversation earlier in John Jesus had a recession with Nicodemus and we will turn to that just after I'm going to turn this on so you can read it and now I am no more in the world like you notice the word in the world but these are in the world and I come to the Holy Father keep through then all name those whom thou hast given me that they may be one as we are while I was with them in the world I kept them in thy name those that thou gave us me I have kept and none of them is lost but the son of perdition that the scripture might be fulfilled and now I come to thee and these things I speak in the world that they might have my joy fulfilled in themselves not his not a distress but a joy fulfilled in themselves not something hilarious or jovial as such but a deep settled joy verse 14 I have given them thy word and the world hath hated them because they are not of the world and I would like you to notice now the word of of' they are not of the world they haven't proceeded from the world they may have gone through the school system that may have gone through further education but they're not of the world they may earn a living there and survive and raise a family but they're not of the world they're not a product of the world and the world have hated them and they are not of the world even as I not of the world I pray that thou sure to take them I pray not that thou shouldn't take them out of the world but that thou should has keep them from the evil they are not of the world even as I am NOT of the world verse 16 and I'm going to turn back to in John's Gospel - John the 3rd chapter and I just want to read a couple of verses starting John 3 and the 3rd verse jesus answered and said unto him that was Nicodemus verily verily I say unto thee except a man be born again he cannot see the kingdom of God so there's another birth except a man be born again except a man be born again he cannot see the kingdom of God Nicodemus saith unto Him how can a man be born when he is old can he enter the second time into his mother's womb and be born and I want to answer no he couldn't because if he with the birth that he had entered into the second second time in his mother's womb and was born it would still be flesh it would still be death it would still be sinful and I'll talk about that in just a moment so jesus answered verse 5 jesus answered verily verily I say unto thee except a man be born of water and of the spirit he cannot enter into the kingdom of God god bless you you may be seated now we had our first birth and that's why we're here you're all here and you have a father and a mother someplace but you were born in sin and you were shaping in iniquities and you came with a human nature and you came as a result of unbelief you're the product of unbelief Eve disbelieved the word Adam went to redeem her and so the first birth we were born in sin and shapen in iniquity x' secondly we're born subject to pain to disease to sickness you're born subject to those things we have Wars all kinds of infirmities and because of that birth this birth that I'm speaking of now the second birth the second birth is the beginning of the creation of God I'd like you to if you have your Bible if you just turn also to Revelation the third chapter and I was very affected by this particular verse revelation the third chapter and the fourteenth verse and unto the Angel of the Church of the Laodiceans write these things saith the Amen now a few moments ago we were reading words that he spoke on earth spoke to mortal ears the very few that will understand these words but now he's still speaking and under the angel of the church of the laodiceans under the messenger of that church he has a special message and he didn't even say speak he said write these things saith the angel these things saith the Amen the faithful and true witness the beginning of the creation of God this is the beginning of another creation the beginning of the creation of God it isn't that God failed in the first creation God knew it was going to go that direction because we sit here in a body through that creation and we're all born in sin I don't care how good you are I don't care what you've believed that has nothing to do with it we are born in sin and shapen iniquities and in this body we will get older we will get weaker brother branham even asked a man he said is it not true that as I eat food and as digested in this body he may not have used those words but he said as I ate food and I eat vegetables and so on I get stronger yes he said that that's correct you get stronger it's because it's bringing blood cells into the bloodstream and you get stronger he said then how is it that I eat today I still eat the same food I still eat the same potatoes they made the same meat and so on but I get weaker and the man didn't have an answer form he gets weaker you get weaker eating the same food but you don't regenerate the same as you do when you're younger so we have a mixed audience here today we have some of you that are receiving the benefits of what you eat on that end but gradually as time goes on you'll find that it becomes more more weight than you want it doesn't do what you want it to do you know I said I used to be able to always do this I could always do this well we don't anymore sister biscuits sitting back there she used to run like an antelope today it's more difficult even to walk steady same thing with myself and so that is one birth and Jesus said to Nicodemus you must you must be born again you cannot see the kingdom of God until you're born again it isn't friends that you sit in this church or any other church that will not give you the vision that you need to have you can clean your glasses that do whatever you wish but that doesn't give you the vision you must be born again and then you shall see the kingdom of God except a man be born again he cannot see the kingdom of God he cannot enter the kingdom of God and I can tell you that this life that you're representing today sitting in the seat that you're in will end then a prophet of God his words will mean so much to you when his words that he spoke and said that this life are you listening this life only changes there's no change actually you you and this life you step into another life you just take one footstep as brother Ernie was describing to us on Wednesday night and you take one step it'll be in time and you'll take another step and you'll be an eternity if you're born again amen allow me just to read I want to read something that I thought of you brother Ken Andes because you put so much meaning and depth to the church ages and I really appreciate that brother Branham says in the church ages just a moment please it's in the layout of sin church age page 336 he says but now he is standing in the midst of his church speaking of Christ as he stands there revealing who he is in this last age he calls himself the author of the creation of God which we just read he calls himself the author of the creation of God this is another creation this has to do with the church this is a special designation of himself he is the creator as John's Gospel says in the beginning was the word and the Word was with God and the Word was God all things were made by him and without him was nothing made that is made he created all things so now he is saying this is another creation this has to do with the church in other words he's going to create something this is a special date designation of himself he is the creator of that church the heavenly bridegroom created his own bride as the Spirit of God as the Spirit of God he came down and created in the Virgin Mary the cells from which his body was born I want to repeat that he created the very cells in the womb of Mary for that body it was not enough for the Holy Spirit to simply give life to a human ovum supplied by Mary that would have been sinful mankind producing a body that would not have to the last Adam are you receiving this of him it is it was said lower body has no father has now prepared for me God not Mary provided that body Mary was the human incubator and she carried that holy child and brought him to birth it was a god man he was the son of God he was the new creation man and God met and joined he was Colossians 1 and 18 for he is the head of the body the church who is the beginning the firstborn from the dead hallelujah and in and in all things he may he may have the preeminence 2nd Corinthians 5 and 17 therefore if any man be in Christ I wish to have this on the slides but I don't have it prepared for you therefore if any man be in Christ he is a new creation you believe that you are a new creation If any man be in Christ he is a new creation old things have passed away and behold all things become new there you can see that though man was of the old order or creation now in union with Christ and here's the key in union with Christ he has become the new creation of God Ephesians 2 and 10 for we are his workmanship created in union with Christ unto good works visions 4 and 24 and that you might put on the new man this is how you do it which after God is created in righteousness and true holiness this new creation is not the old creation made over or it could not be called a new creation this is exactly what this this is exactly what it says it is new creation it is another creation distinct from the old one no longer is he dealing by the ways of the flesh this was this was how he dealt with Israel he chose Abraham is the mammoth of the flesh and of Abraham's issue see God had promised him seed of Abraham's issue through the godly Isaac lion but now out of every kindred tribe and nation he has proposed a new creation he is the first of the that creation he was God created in the form of man now by his Spirit he is creating many sons unto himself God the creator of creating himself a part of his creation is not wonderful this is the new revelation this is the new revelation of God this was his purpose and then I have underlined and highlighted this purpose took form through election and I could continue on but I want to just stop there you cannot supersede the election of God you're sitting here by his election you owe a debt to him to thank him to worship Him because he simply elected that you'd be born in a certain place I want to just speak about these two births for a moment I've been pondering them for days weeks and you that are mothers and fathers well bye with technology maybe you didn't know it was a boy or a girl but you knew very little and and and that's not thanks to you that's thanks to technology when my daughters were born they wouldn't even let me go into the to the sea where the children were I was not permitted I could only look at them through a glass you say how horrible well that's part of my life as a horrible part of my life you know I couldn't even see my daughters I couldn't even see him my children that's you know for a husband to stand there it's very humiliating yeah it's my seed but I can't even see them I can't they've got to put this glass between me and my child and my wife is sitting there our last daughter that is sitting here today Tom's wife Joanne I was working and so I raced home because I was going to fix myself something to eat real quick and run down to the hospital and so I phoned nurses station and I said how's Ruth Fiscal said she bought the same I said okay fine I had lots of time so about 25 minutes later I got a phone call and it's from the hospital my wife was on the phone I said oh hi I just talked with the nurses station and she said well it's a girl I said come on I said aye aye aye I know better I've just talked to the nurse and she said everything's probably the same no she said it's a girl I said you're kidding and what I didn't know is that her father came in to see her and the bed was empty and there was another sister there we knew and related by marriage and and she was there she said well I I think she maybe just went down to the washroom or something so he said well I'll just go there's another old timer here I'll go and visit him and then I'll come back so he came back in the boat 20 minutes or half an hour he came back after a little time of visiting and and she's in her bed and well he said I was just in here she said well it's a girl and there was a shock to him as well and so I I raced out of the hospital of course it was a girl and I had prayed because I had doubted my own prayer I guess I prayed for a son and I said if it's a girl just make it that they all can sing and so that part of my request I got but the other part I didn't have I wanted a boy but I never got a boy got three girls all right that's natural birth but isn't it in it incredible that something this dynamic something so life-changing something that's going to change your entire home and your life at home and maybe your job and all of these things you don't have anything to say about it is that amazing heavenly father something like this I don't have anything to say about it and I'd furthermore you have nothing to say about their nature or their character or what you're going to like her what they're going to dislike you you have very little whether they've got skills or whether they're gifted you don't know anything about it you say well I'll do everything I can well you can do everything you can but if the kid hasn't got it they don't have it you can't put it in them I know a little bit about that I had I had one daughter you know I I have a lot of experience and I had one daughter and she would she would come and tap on my cheek at about 3:30 in the morning many many mornings yes Marilyn she'd be standing there in their little nightgown and tapping and she it was like the Chinese torture treatment I believe they had and she would just tap on she would tap on there as long as it took for me to open my eyes and she couldn't say her arse either at that time which is no surprise I couldn't say until I was about 8 but she would tap on my face and then when I had opened my eyes she'd say I need a pencil and a paper because she was going to be an artist someday now you ought to see when she takes a pen in her hand and I and and I said there and say how do you know to do that well it was back there I should have known when she was saying I need a pencil in the paper that she was trying to tell me I got it in me and I have to do something about it I need a pencil and a paper so I get up and get her a pencil and a paper that was a natural birth natural birth as wonderful as it might be we're born in sin and Chafin iniquities doesn't regardless of how beautiful you are or how young you are or and that has nothing to do with that you're still gonna get stooped over and you're still hair is gonna turn white in they're still gonna get wrinkled and and and shaking when you get older you that happens it's and that's this life thank God that there's a new birth thank god there's another birth it's not wishful thinking it's not in our mind and I want to talk about these two do I have a few minutes we have a second birth the beginning of the creation of God the beginning of the creation of God comes and washes away that deformities of the first birth it's either a weaker birth or it's a stronger birth and my conviction to you is it's a stronger birth there's a light that comes within the body to this in this flesh in this beginning of the creation of God or this shall I say this old creation and you know there's some light we have light I don't know how to describe it exactly we can say well because you can speak or because you can see or because well it has a measure of light but the second birth is a perfect light the second birth your thinking will be correct and your thinking will not be of doubt or unbelief there's a complete change between the new birth second birth and the first birth the beginning of the creation of God comes and washes away the deformities of sin and the Mar of the effects of unbelief you know when the serpent and Eve had their initial conversation it wasn't just what was spoken but it was a displacement of headship the Bible says clearly that she should have been able to go and talk to her husband but neither was he able to give her the kind of instruction that she needed I'm just thinking of something that I perhaps should say and I don't want to say but and I have said this over the pulpit here when brother Branham speaks about the masterpiece and how Michelangelo struck that masterpiece when he finally sought what was an image in his mind and he finally sought there and he says they may be picked at it for years and someone maybe would say why are you picking at that why you hitting that stone but when they finally saw the image of what he had in his mind he thought it should speak to him and he struck it on the knee and made him are he marred the image and he said speak because he thought it should speak to him it looks so real it was such a fulfillment of what he saw in his mind and brother Branham says and it could only take a prophet you couldn't say this with human intellect he said Tamar is what made it the masterpiece and we think now of the Mahr of the first birth and we were marred you can take a child out of a good home on a good Christian parents and put them up in the mountain where he'll never see any evil or never never contact anything he won't see other peers of his of his age dabbling in sinful things but he'll still have a sinful nature he'll still come against things that are right and pure and so on and that's because he'll be he could be better but the gospel didn't come to make people better the Prophet said in the message he swore by himself he says in Jesus Christ formed from a blood cell and the outside shield of the cell itself which is billions times billions smaller than a human eye can see but that was the body the Lord Jesus inside of that was God himself wrapped himself around the blood cell in order to take his own blood and to spill his own blood or give it freely that we through the breaking of that blood cell to our to our mortal to our mortal when when it breaks and our life leaves from here to go out through the redemption of the blood that God required we can we can be brought into that body and brought a part of God himself as a son of God brother if you can digest that it'll share do you good I wish I had some way to just show you what it what what it is just think of God Jehovah coming down into the womb of a woman overshadowed come down in that in the down in this down to spirit and he's in them where is he he's the creator himself he made the very woman in the womb he made the very woman in the womb that that he was in right then God made I excuse me but it's not always easy to easy to read exactly as the Prophet speaks God made himself little came down and got into his blood own into this blood cell and his and he began to build something around him what was it he said when the Holy Ghost overshadowed her and put a blood cell in into her womb in creation God the creator made that made that and and that came to be the son of God amen outside of believing that you're lost by all you could do you have to believe that in order to be saved now here we have the beginning of the creation of God I have a thought that I want to convey to you and I think that I will just speak it to you now I've established there is a new birth there's an old birth and a new birth I want this congregation to understand except ye be born again you cannot enter the kingdom of God you can do a lot with this you can go shopping you go fix it up you get your hair cut you ma'am you can look fine you can go to the gym and all of that other stuff but still one day you're going to lay on a cold slab whether you're a Bill Gates with twenty or thirty or forty billion dollars just paper or where you're somebody who's in debt you'll all lay on the slab and that's where you'll find common ground when the ecumenical movement was moving and everybody was joining this and speaking in tongues and so on and so forth I was in a house on Vancouver Island as a result of the radio broadcast and the family who's who owned that house their own brother Roger Smith's church in Abbotsford to this day and they invited me to come there and brother Amy Mullin how many remembers brother Amy Mullin put your hands up high so he's not a stranger to the congregation brother Amy Mullen was in his brother was his brother in the flesh he was a hopeless hopeless hopeless alcoholic he was a good Catholic and he gave himself to go to Borneo and the islands in the South Sea to work on a gospel ship he thought surely I will find peace with God and I will find freedom from this demon of alcohol and he came to the knowledge of the message as a result of my visit over there he wasn't there he heard of it through his brother but I remember they were seated on the floor started here went around some in chairs there was 22 people and I said I didn't know what to say really I just came there as a visitor and I was looking to the Lord that I could say something of value so I said now I don't know you you're all strangers to me I said this person over here might be Salvation Army this one might be Catholic and this one over here might be a Baptist and I I went around this maybe jovis witness this baby whatever and I just named all the different groups that I could recall quickly and I said now would like to have the Bible says now I'm quoting the Bible the Bible says that Jesus the Word was made flesh I said I would like the real Jesus to stand up nobody stood up I said and I read from the scripture I said this is Christ this is him and I said I know that the Salvation Army they described Jesus one way and Catholics another way and Baptists another way and I know that they do not agree I said who has Jesus I'm confused I want to know who has Jesus and and as a result the owner of the home gave his life to this Jesus that he was hearing now I'm coming to my main thought in just a moment so I want your listening real nice and I said this Jesus this word this we will refer often to the word but the words of God please just give me your full attention thank you your mother when your father's seed I'm speaking to adults now your father's seed came to the womb of your mother and your mother a of the vegetation of the earth the herbs the fruit whatever more you are a product of the Word of God even this shell here you are a product of the Word of God in that in that sense you also our product of Eve's and Eve's disobedience of disbelief that's why a prophet comes and says sin is not the drinking and the smoking and the gambling that's not simple that those are the attributes of said even adultery and all of those things as the attributes of sin the sin is not believing the fullness of the word of God that's the sin I hope you get that we all came the same way our mothers and fathers were product of the earth Jesus Christ Himself the body was formed the Bible says she believed let it be unto me as thou has spoken she believed the Virgin Mary believed the Word of God that a virgin would conceive and a prophet of God you'll not hear it anywhere else so pay real strict attention the prophet of God said those words those words that were spoken by the Prophet because it wasn't a man it wasn't just Isaiah speaking it was God issuing his intent concerning the new creation through Herman through there his mouth said a virgin shall conceive and he says those words anchored in her heart in her in the womb of Mary and the end and those words anchored in her womb here she is a vessel of the earth and those who eternal words that were spoken by the mouth of God had a different intent I hope you're able to understand even though even though she herself was a product of the earth her mother ate the vegetables and so on and she's going to continue to eat to give a human life to a man and God would be in him reconciling the world to himself and that is why he went to Calvary people celebrate Easter they know nothing about Easter I tell you that this is a new creation walking amongst an old creation and Friends here's the struggle that you and I have we are a new creation we're no creation by the Holy Spirit of God he brooded over the earth and up came the flowers and up came and God said let the earth bring forth and it brought forth trees and herbs thou shalt eat of all the herbs and the plants and the things and they could eat of it but they could not partake of the tree of knowledge of good and evil and of that tree in other words there was an object that would present itself and they must not partake of that and I can tell you friends today this is not just my own thoughts but you have to have the wisdom of the Holy Ghost one person goes through further education and they can come out fine because they keep eating from another tree they keep eating from the tree of life which is greater than the tree of knowledge of good and evil the light that's in the believer is greater than the darkness that's in the world you say amen to that the message is greater and now we have a people birth by the Holy Spirit and feeding on the word that God gives to the believer it's a divine thing you have nothing you go to the you go to the stored you go to the fruit stand and you say well I'll have some of this and I'll have some of this dill and I'll have some turnips and I'll have you had nothing to do with bringing that forth the people who we did the garden had nothing to do with it it grew because God said it back there let the earth bring forth and I Drive past the fields here on 40th Avenue and I think Oh God how man just is so benefited from the from what you said hundreds and thousands of years ago let the earth bring forth every season it brings forth and we go to the store and we think that we're wonderful I'm able to save on foods or safely or wherever mourn by all of these vegetables we didn't have anything to do the man who put them there didn't have anything to do the man who bought them and paid for them and the farmer who sprayed it he doesn't have anything to do with that the earth brought it forth and our mothers and fathers ate it and produced us by the act of marriage we didn't have very little to do we had very little to do with bringing ourselves forth and then you went to a church you went to a certain place and this one preaches that and that one preacher something else it and they made denominations and made creeds and made books and you had to believe these books or some and then Satan is so subtle he said say they just got books yeah they just got something to believe well Jesus also believed something he said what Moses said to do that do but don't be as these people who say it but don't do it I stood here in red and I felt unworthy reading John 17 don't John 17 ever don't ever look upon John 17 as just some verses in the Bible it's more than that it's a man of God the Son of God son of the Living God speaking these things to his father and it says father I'm no longer in the world but these are in the world be with them I've kept them from the world he's kept you from the world and then he turned around and said these are not of the world even as I am NOT of the world I'm not the product of the world I'm the product he didn't even came to be the product of Adam and Eve he was a product of Almighty God and we have been birthed by the Holy Ghost we've been birthed that's not just a phrase we've been birthed by the Holy Spirit of God it has brooded upon this word these seeds this happens to be God's seed human seed brings forth all kinds of life human seed brings forth all kinds of life some that God will destroy and some that God will take as his own family human seed you know who are yours your relatives whatever more but God's seed is this and the Holy Spirit comes and broods upon this seed and splashed to life [Applause] the human seed the sperm of the man I'm speaking now to adults the human sperm of the man goes and you'll understand something in just a moment but it goes and of all those billions of germs one will go and attach itself to the egg of the female and to the wall where it's intended and the organs who put those organs there God himself he made the whole thing who did the conception God and by election he elected some some he elected this will be my child he doesn't care where they were born he doesn't care what color they are he doesn't care what he gave them the color their eyes and the color of their hair he gave it all at that time that's God's doing aren't we glad for God's plan oh thank you friends we think we thank our Heavenly Father it is such a marvelous plan and then now here is a god he brought about the first creation and it fell he brought about the second creation and it does not fall it does not fail and down through the centuries he sent his messengers and the world slew them jesus said you kill the prophets fill up the cup of the prophets because fill up the cup of wrath because he do they were not accepting him are you following me and Almighty God who created all things and the earth and all of these things he's not going to allow he's not going to allow the product of the new birth to be overcome by the product of the earth he's not going to book he's not going to allow the new creation to be overcome by the old creation and so the Holy Spirit brooded upon the earth we know that and up came the growth and the vegetables and so on and so forth of the Prophet brother branham even speaks of it and I hope that you have the capacity to understand that the product of the old birth has brought this life and Satan he just plays games he tantalize and with it and all kinds of things and makes things that are so have such an effect upon the emotions and brother Ernie that's why I so enjoyed the service that he took the power of the senses and how Satan so tantalizes those senses and and anyone who has not got the new birth they'll be taken by these but when you have the new birth it's not when you're old and naturally when you have the new birth I didn't have any interest in the world when I was just a teenager before we were married I had a vehicle and I had guys that could come by they come by where I worked and say do you want a drag race I thought drag race are you crazy why did I think that what he thought was exciting was it crazy to me I don't know I don't know I can't explain that I just can't explain that and here I got something you know I want to ask you I was age some of you young men I had to work to we had to work and earn very little money it was before credit cards and I couldn't run up the gas pumps and get money that way get credited that way but I had a hunger just want to want to ask you about that's why I'm standing here today had a hunger a hunger I was so hungry for the things of God so we heard that there was a meeting my wife went with a friend and some pick up her car or something I didn't know it was 350 miles for where we lived I got on a motorcycle I had a motorcycle I had to work until 5 or 6 o'clock and after that that I got on the motorcycle and started to drive into Alberta to northern Alberta to a city called Manning Alberta there was very little pavement it was mostly it was cold colder that it is outside but it reminds me of the time this is still the same person it was these legs I threw over a motorcycle and I got and we didn't have nice outfits that you could buy there were weather proof and I drove tell away late in the night and it was becoming one on two o'clock in the morning and past Grand Prairie brother Tim and over the smokey River and I got it got very cold at night and I was pounding these legs to keep them from freezing yeah these lace legs of the earth legs is the first creation but inside was another creation inside there was a hunger the no man was so hungry for God and I pulled into a place I see light often and I just have something in the human nature I just oh I don't want to bother people I don't want to I don't want to interrupt their evening as one as put two o'clock in the morning and then there was light right beside the road in a little log house so I just pulled quickly off I couldn't go any further and I leave my motorcycle against the wall came to the front door just heard of man inside y'all come on em so I opened the door and here's a guy at the back and he's got his feet up on the table he's reading a book he said you ever hear this author he named the author I thought I'm a total stranger but we know we never worried about anybody coming in to rob anybody yeah that was out of our mind and he said do you ever read a book by this soul I said no I haven't no I never did so I said listen I I just I just came up with a motorcycle I said I didn't hear I said yeah I parked it right outside and I said I'm just wondering if he got a place I should kind of camp over the night oh yeah I says bedrooms right there you can stay there I don't know why I don't know his name I don't know anything about him I don't know if it was married or not married it probably wasn't but anyway said you didn't just stay there I'll make it bacon eggs in the morning and so I never did find out his name and I prayed God just make a place to give him a bed some place some time and I got up in the morning and went the rest of the way you know why and then there was about four inches of snow fresh snow and the cars were going by an a started to melt and they thought it was fun you know they just splash splash me up with with their cars they sped by that was the only direction only time we had a little better pavement and I finished off the trip why I'm just hungry for a meeting I just want to be in church that night I don't know the name of the pastor yes I do his name was Erickson I think he was a Baptist Baptist and organization didn't mean nothing didn't mean nothing it was in that atmosphere the prophet of God's ministry was born and that's one we just accepted this is just a natural thing and you know what we said we said he's a prophet we didn't we didn't know any of the scripture we didn't know Malachi for we didn't know revelation 10 we said there's a prophet this is what a prophet does this is what a prophet says and so we went to that meeting and and I'm just gonna tell you this and I'm finished with it that night I stated in the sleeping bag with four or five other brothers at the back of the church in the kitchen or something and I got down in that sleeping bag and I got such a burden I got I to intercede I didn't know what a hardly intercession was but I knew what a burden was friends this is a real life this isn't just going to church Sunday morning this is going so hungry and so sensitive to the Holy Spirit that the Holy Spirit can speak or can lay something on your heart you don't have to be thinking about what you're going to do tomorrow it's God Almighty thinking what he's going to do tomorrow and so I I rolled and I wept and I groaned and I didn't know what I was praying for and I groaned and rolled until I just was weak and I finally just went to sleep in the morning the pastor I've never heard he got up in the morning and he said we grieved the holy spirit last night he said we grieved the holy spirit last night I didn't know what he was talking about then he said somebody prayed and I went to him right after the service and told him what happened to me said that was it he never said anything further so there was a almost like a little mystery to the whole thing you know brother Branham speaks about people who are led by the Holy Ghost and there are almost mystics to the world the world can understand that isn't two and two makes four that is that's above algebra that's that's something from another realm but when you're born again you're dictated to by the Holy Spirit and we have those things I don't tell about a lot of those things that happen regularly in this congregation supernatural things and that's what makes me to know there's a God in heaven as ordained Himself is ordained that we should believe and furthermore that is why ministry comes behind this pulpit and begins to speak from the message from the word and here I'm going to make known to you something that perhaps hasn't come to your mind the Prophet said lay sell upon sell sell upon sell do you know anything about your body forming that you're sitting in right now is you you know anything about performing you weren't around did you give any instruction or direction did your mother or father give any instruction or direction is how he's going to be this house she's gonna be it didn't have anything to do with it and now a message comes and you don't know anything about the servant the vessel and God is pushing himself himself through clay redeemed clay and it takes a vessel and people to me it's so absurd forgive me but I think that people will rise themselves up in their mind and say well I this is what I think of William Branham and this is what I think of the Pope and this is what I think who cares what you think God's already decided God's already got election God is saying and I am saying on his behalf God says election is mine I do what I will I do what I intend to do and I will fulfill it you you can wrestle all you wish friends but God in the end his Will shall be done and the elects sake I will be done on earth as it is in heaven this is mine you are my father and this is my attitude towards you I bless your name I worship you because you have brought me your holy spirit has has brooded over the words how will I how I know which words it is he selected certain ones he selected a message for Philadelphia for Thyatira and verse artists and he selected a message from Laodicea and he says to John write and tell him who's speaking I'm the faithful one I'm the a man of God I'm the faithful messenger and write these things to the angel or to the messenger the angel of the church and I wonder I had not intended on saying much about this you're familiar with all the destruction that's been taking place and I'm just reading what others have said the 2018 wildfire session is the most destructive on record in California with a total of seven thousand five hundred and seventy nine fires burning an area of 1 million six hundred and sixty seven thousand eight hundred and fifty five acres the largest amount of burned acreage recorded in a fire season according the California Department of Forestry brother branham spoke a message in Yuma Arizona right on the border on December the 4th in 1965 listen close now if you were Almighty God women man if you were Almighty God and you could sit on your throne you say well now this is the last message and I send it to the earth and I've said to my Apostle John I showed him gave him the message to the lay of the sins now I want you to write write it and send it to the angel of that church and now the great eternal God when that season comes his spirit is directed his spirit who's the author of this word see now there's a certain thing that must be said and I want you now to brood over these cells brood over this might eternal life giving Word of God there will be some elected people they will be living by the first birth but I am not willing that they shall be destroyed I am not willing that my enemy our enemy Satan should foil my plan they shall come forth and I shall send this holy spirit my spirit to brood over the earth now the word has gone yeah they put it into books they put into all kinds of theological seminaries etc and have declared this and that and the other thing but I have a prophet down there and I want you to get this message to him and let him identify himself in the scripture in my word let him identify himself he's the one who must speak and say these things and this is the one this is the almighty speaking this is the Amen the faithful and true witness furthermore this is the beginning of the creation of God and brood over these words and as it's brooding over the words the brooding of the great son of God shines upon stones nothing happens shines upon some part of Earth and maybe vegetation comes but signs upon some wheat gathered into my car I have much to say and at the end of this age these are the things that are going to take place and this prophet his book is the message of rapture you plan to be in the rapture he spoke about the rapture this is the fourth the last message that he speaks and as three hours and 41 minutes by car to go to Rialto California and there he will preach things that are to be and this is where much of this message even came from he speaks of the relationship and now of the coming of the children coming forth and then 40 minutes from there 40 minutes he'll speak the next night in San Bernardino and he will speak their modern events made clear by prophecy and in that service he says this is a horrible time but it's the most glorious time in the world to preach the gospel what's he talking to talking about the tooth to move to to creations it's a horrible time for the lost it's the most glorious time to preach the gospel that's the only way you can have a horrible time in a wonderful time my friends believe her friends this is a horrible time but it's a glorious time to stand for Christ and for the new creation of God the most glorious time to preach the gospel if I could have stood on the brink of time before it came into existence and the father would have looked at me and said what time down through the ages would you want to preach I'd want it right now that's right just before the coming just before the coming of hell oh if I could only preach just before he comes just before this rapture which he described just two days ago I would want to preach at this time even though it's a terrible time it's a wicked time and the thoughts of man's mind and intent are only evil continually friends this world is fitted for destruction California will be just child's play alongside of what's going to happen the prophet of God spoke about the earth erupting and coming forth I'll tell you what even down in Hawaii they even tried to figure out how to stop the lava they couldn't stop it and couldn't stop it from burning the tribe this prophet of God said and you can take whatever direction you want to take I just say I believe it he said the earth will burst forth so I don't believe in some someone might say I don't believe in the hell you're standing on Earth is sitting this morning Sunday morning on a whole globe full of it 40 minutes from San Bernardino and he was in Covina to preach the last service I suggest you read all of those rapture three hours 40 minutes later things that are to be 40 minutes another direction to Covina and Neri preaches leadership and he asks in there who's leading you now who's leaving you now what about a young fellows well my teacher or my professor said such-and-such his voice will be silent he won't even be around my boss my superior said I was doing this I was doing that but what does he say that's the one to listen to that's the one to listen to and all these other things we may just use use them but say this life will be given to hunger after God that doesn't mean we just walk around you know and do nothing no but we have a direction and God is our direction I hope these things have meant something to you I've been very affected by it and so now say well what what did you say and I'm closing what do you say in the last two hours while you've sat here there may be somebody you may have conceived I'm speaking very plain there may be some mother here that is conceived and you don't even know it you have no way of knowing it but there may be an infant that has been conceived we don't know but in the new in the new birth maybe someone has conceived maybe a life has come into the individual heart so I I don't know where the spot is but wouldn't that be more important the other one's gonna bring a human this one's gonna bring a son or daughter of God born again of the Spirit of God what are they gonna do is it's gonna be another Fanny Crosby or is it going to be what is it going to be another ministers wife or another preacher of the gospel we don't know we have no way of knowing and it's not our business I say thy will be done it'll be faithful to this word somebody will hear it somebody will be moved somebody will be fed Oh precious young people precious young people just give your strength give your future days to him will you bow your head with me Heavenly Father we've spoken what you've laid upon our heart and I have sought to deliver it to them to the people of congregation that you've gathered here today I pray father you'll take this chart pray you'll take the congregation the song leaders in the worship leaders the musicians Oh God those that attend to the streaming and sending this word out oh god we want to we we are not afraid to be identified with your messenger Oh God we thank you that you send them we thank you that you have sent the Holy Ghost you've not only guided him but now you guide us into this word and here we are Lord representing the message to the Laodicean Church we see a world that is falling apart Oh God we see such confusion and everybody to be the truth we thank you all God you speak your truth and you confirm your truth you vindicate your truth and we ask you to come forward Lord and vindicate father I pray the power of Christ the power of Calvary in healing Oh God our brother Peter Oh God raised him up father not for our glory but for your glory raise him up of God our sister Helen bills Berger raise her up Oh God give her the use of her body old father I pray in Jesus Christ's name there may be many others that are suffering Lord or there are others that Satan has attracted and he has done everything he can Lord to draw them aside I pray father it will be in vain as of now let the Holy Spirit them and invalidate what he is attempting to do Lourdes perhaps people that have been invited are visiting for the first time oh I pray oh god I pray father in the name of the son of God Jesus Christ that they will feel a sensation of a pull a drawing oh god a drawing that we cannot understand one that will say I will go I will seek out these things Lord may they be like the Bereans I pray father you'll bless this service and the service tonight and our brother John that will journey with his family down to Renton Oh God moved by your Holy Spirit on this West Coast we pray in the name of Jesus Christ we give you all the glory amen and amen amen god bless you isn't it wonderful he's wonderful yes he is brother tom [Music] thank you for your attention [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] the musicians continued to play I thought it was just the Lord that we showed a picture of a little baby at the beginning of a service the natural but how greater is that spiritual birth that joy that bring that little baby will bring a home will be just tremendous but the joy that brings the body of Christ is a new birth and that is the most important thing not allowing the new creation to be overcome from the old creation this new creation that God is creating there's a deep calling to the deep I don't know about you but that's all I've been in in the last few days future home things that are to be it's a call it's a poll we're living in the two realms in the two worlds but I'm so thankful at a horrible time as the pastor was saying this is the most glorious time for the elect of God and if you haven't come to this knowledge of salvation or Jesus Christ as a personal Savior maybe this is your service and the Holy Spirit is tugging at your heart saying just surrender I feel appalled I want to pass from death unto life I want to go into his glorious Kingdom I want to be carried away I want to be raptured I want to be changed maybe the word is speaking to you because each and every one must be born again I feel [Music] [Music] it's bow our heads in a word of Prayer maybe there's somebody here this morning that actually feels the pole or the tug of the Holy Spirit and God's dealing with your heart and you on a surrender in a greater way a more consecrated way a more dedicated way as a scripture was read this morning you must be born again it's not an option it's it's it's something that it comes from within and if you're here this morning you just want to lift up your heart lift up your hand and say lord save me deliver me set me free from the entanglements of sin and depression for the burden of being lost no hope nowhere to go but there's something within you that it feels the pull that said Lord here am i Lord save me save me Lord and Lord with these hands and different ones raised around the room you know the heart you know the reason where some feel the pull and others it just goes right over so father I pray that that hand and lift it up that God you'll reach down your hand and he'll start and Kindle a fire that will never be quenched Lord that the Holy Spirit Himself would breathe upon that life and bring forth a new creation by the word of life that was spoken this morning confirm your word Lord confirm it in the hearts of your children and let the Holy Ghost have its free course and committing these hands in these lives and these needs to you in Jesus precious name

today to reveal it to the sons and daughters of God how happy we should be how thankful we should be that actually we did feel the pull of God amen then I don't know what to say coz brother Driscoll just just broke the last half of his erector turned over to brother John I said I'm in a heap of trouble I'm preaching on fire tonight birthed by the fire of God so God has a continuity and we just pray that you'll come expecting come pray that we also could have the fire of God there's a reason why there's fires going on because there's a holy fire descending and there's another fire that's come so that we can ascend may God bless you may the presence of God go with you may you ponder these things as Mary did when she heard the salutation of an angel she pondered these things within her heart we've heard from God this morning so god bless you greet one another you're dismissed in Jesus name Amen [Music]
