It's so wonderful to be anchored into him, isn't it? This morning, Amen. I have one prayer request. I'm going to ask brother John Andy's to come and take this before the Lord. Please pray for healing for sister Louise who has a bad cold and a cough. Also like to remind you to pray for brother Louise and his son brother Louise Jr. They left this morning for South America. You know it was just spent some time with him last night. Just such a wonderful testimony of how God's dealing in their life and God's dealing at the other end. So they're going to be gone for five weeks. So we don't want to pray for them just this morning. the next five weeks, who's going to remember brother Louise &gt;&gt; every day. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. That God would lead him, that God would bless him, and make him make make him a blessing. Amen. Brother John. Amen. Let's join our hearts together. Heavenly Father, it's good to be in your house, Lord Jesus. Lord, a place that we can open up our hearts and our mouths and lift up our hands and shout hallelujah, Lord. Let the glories roll, Lord. We just come this morning into your presence, God. Just un knowing what you're going to do. Uh expecting the unexpected, Lord. But we want to confess that we are looking for you, Jesus. We're looking for you in the song service. We're looking before the service. We've come waiting, lingering. We've come praying, Lord. And even now throughout the congregation, we want to look away from any sin or any idol, any unbelief or any shackle of the enemy that he would be trying to put onto us. We're looking away from that and we're looking to your word, Father. Your word has the answer. Your word is our source of release. It's in your presence, God, that we can let off the pressure. You have made us as believers to look to you to look to this not to this place of made of wood and stone but to the place of your presence Lord where the shikina is where your glory is where your word is present ever near. And this morning we're looking away from our sickness. We're looking away from our pain or our suffering or what would come into our human minds. We're looking away from that. We're looking to the unseen. We're looking to our new bodies, Lord. We're looking to that eternal dimension where all things are possible. We're looking away from money and men and women and houses and lands. We're going beyond this earthly realm that we are so attached to. Lord, we cast it aside this morning, Jesus. What we can see, what we can feel, what we can taste. Lord, we're looking to that faith realm. We're looking to that soul ram, Lord. We've been trained as eagles to soar, Lord. Lord, we love eagle food, Lord. Where the carcass is, that's where the eagles are going to be gathered. We believe in the rapture season that we are in now that the dead in Christ shall rise. We which are alive and remain shall be joined with them. Our hearts are tuned in to that that channel this morning, that soul channel, Father. Lord, that food is coming down, Lord, to meet the need for the hour. And we're under breathtaking anticipation for what you're even going to do in this service, God. Miracles could happen, Lord. May the faith bank be so strong this morning. Let it be milky in this service, God. That even the minister wouldn't even be able to stand, Lord, and speak his own mind, but the mind of Christ would take so charge of our lives, Lord. That it would discern the very needs and hearts and situation that while we yet hear the word, Lord, our lives could be filled, sisters could be filled, brothers could be filled, needy hearts, unspoken requests. Hands are lifted up throughout the service. Those on the internet, Lord, on the phone, hook up Jesus. We're lifting our hand to you, Lord, the author and the finisher of our faith. Who for the joy that was set before you, you endured the cross. May we also as your bride with joy that is set before us, take up our cross and follow you today. We pray for Sister Louise, God. We pray that you would touch her, God, today. That you would minister to her life, minister to her need. And our precious brother Louise and his son, God, may your Holy Spirit be with them even as they travel today. May they feel a surge of your Holy Spirit that you are with them even in them all the way to the end. Father, you're wrapping up this Gentile dispensation and you're blending into that dispensation of the Jews. But may we as your people not lose heart or lose faith that you have not left us without a seed. But you are among us, God, even to that very hour of our taking away. You're our El Shadi. You're our healer. You're our deliverer. You're our only source of hope, God. Jesus, we have confidence in your word today that what you're going to speak is exactly what we need. And we cry, "Aba, Father. Our Father has adopted sons and daughters. We take you at your word. It's thus sayaith the Lord." And we're holding on to it, Lord. Hallelujah, Lord. Let's just worship him. Let's just worship him together. We receive your word, God. God, we receive this morning our need. Lord, we just put it before you, God. Believing that you have all that we have need of, God, we receive it today, God. We receive your Holy Spirit, God. We receive healing and deliverance, Lord. We receive the mind of Christ. We receive leadership and direction, the shepherd of the flock. Lord, we turn to you today, Lord. lead and guide us throughout this service, Lord. And we'll give you the glory and the honor and the praise, Lord. And we thank you, Jesus, for being ever present, Lord, being near to us as you promise you never forsake us. You'd be with us all the way to the end. Thank you, Jesus, for answering every prayer, God. Even before we see the results, we want to say thank you, God. Thank you for coming in this service, God. Thank you for coming, Lord. Thank you for ministering to us, God. Thank you that we can give back to you, God. And we can give to one another to be a hand extended, Lord. Anoint every life, fill every vessel, Lord. May Satan be defeated on every front. &gt;&gt; We look forward to your appearing, Jesus. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen.

Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Isn't it wonderful to be in his presence? &gt;&gt; Wonderful Lord Jesus. &gt;&gt; So good to have you have you all here to worship. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; We don't want to be rushed. &gt;&gt; We just want to flow in what he has for us. &gt;&gt; Praise God. So good to see you, Brother Gary. Amen. Praise the Lord. Well, we we've just had a lot of thoughts in our our mind concerning this morning's service and are just praying that the Holy Spirit will place on each one of us a spirit of revelation. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That we may see things that we've never seen before. &gt;&gt; Amen. And we may we may be impacted in a special way. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. I think of the scripture where Jesus said he said in Matthew 22 he said what think ye of Christ? That was an interesting question. and uh he was speaking to very very learned men, leaders, teachers, ministers, whatever more. And three or four verses down, the Bible says, "And no man was able to answer him." I just I'm giving you a few thoughts before we have prayer and read the scripture. Today we're here and quite frankly I'm I'm very conscious that God Almighty, all knowing, knew of this service, knew precisely the time that we all would be here. He knew exactly who was going to be here. And I'm absolutely convinced there was just nothing by accident. &gt;&gt; Now, people are gathered in all kinds of meetings and all kinds of churches and all kinds of places, all kinds of theories and all kinds of doctrines and all kinds of who knows what. And we're just not concerning ourselves with that right now. We're concerning ourselves with ourselves that we're here. And because God knew about this, I wonder what God's thought was &gt;&gt; for this meeting. &gt;&gt; And somehow I I I believe that he thought he would like to have a close fellowship with us. &gt;&gt; Amen. I think that in his thought it would be he'd really like to make himself known &gt;&gt; to us in a way that you have never known him before. Maybe just even a just a touch closer. Just something a little bit different about it. And maybe that's what was in his mind. So the service this morning is going to be going along these lines. And before we turn to the word where we'll be looking at John's gospel, the fourth chapter. Uh but we'll we'll have a a moment of prayer if you would please and then we'll read the scripture. Dear heavenly father, we've been so conscious from last night on into this morning as the song service has been uh conducted and our brother Kim leading the people in worship and the people so so openly worshiping you. Father, I pray that you will be pleased with it in such a way that you will come amongst us. I pray that you will speak so that the individual will hear you. I pray that we will be so attuned to the spiritual that we will want to uh be removed from the things of this life. And may we be so made ready, oh God, for your word. I pray, Father, that you will speak to us in a special way. And may this be a special day. I pray you'll bless us, oh God, as we are also thinking of the service this evening. And our brother Ernie Villanoeva who has not been before us for some time. And I pray, oh God, that the things which are been placed on his heart and and those things that he will tell us of of Philippines and where else, Lord, I pray that you'll use him. Bless this congregation of people in the name of Jesus Christ with supernatural blessings. I pray in Jesus name. Amen. I'm going to ask uh brother Tom if you'll read for me. We're going to turn to John's Gospel, the fourth chapter. Thank you, musicians. This is quite a lengthy reading. I'm I hope you won't mind. We're going to start reading from the fifth verse. and down through and including the 29th verse. It's a it's a very very familiar story, very familiar account. But now, while we read this, here's what I want you to be uh thinking of. When Jesus began to speak to this woman at the well, she had conducted her life with her own thinking. Obviously, like anyone, I'm sure that she did the best that she could. I believe she wanted happiness. I believe she wanted fulfillment of life. I believe that anything that a woman of Samaria may have desired, she desired it. And so her life was conducted with her own thoughts by her own thoughts. So Jesus had to in this process, he had to move her from her thoughts and actually bring her into the very thought of God. Right. &gt;&gt; And it's a very interesting as you as you listen and read it with that in mind. She lived her life by her own thoughts and now she had an in an interruption as it were in her normal life. And here's one that starts to speak to her about things that are not strange or unusual. But he moves he moves her and she she becomes transient from the natural until Jesus brings her into the very mind of God. Amen. &gt;&gt; And when that happened because I want to speak on conditions for change part two &gt;&gt; and that this woman was changed. &gt;&gt; Dramatically, wonderfully, gloriously changed. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Brother John Tom, if you will just read please for us uh from verse 5 to 29. Then cometh he to a city of Samaria which is called Saikar near to the parcel of ground that Jacob gave to his son Joseph. Now Jacob's well was there, and Jesus therefore being wearied with his journey, sat thus on the well, and it was about the sixth hour. There cometh a woman of Samaria to draw water. And Jesus said unto her, "Give me to drink, for his disciples were gone away unto the city to buy meat." Then saith the woman of Samaria unto him, How is it that thou being a Jew askest, drink of me, which I'm a woman of Samaria, for the Jews have no dealings with the Samaritans? And Jesus answered and said unto her, If thou kneest the gift of God, and who it is that saith thee, Give me the drink, thou would have asked of him, and he would have given thee living water. The woman said unto him, "Sir, thou has nothing to draw with, &gt;&gt; and the well is deep. From whence then hast thou living water? Art thou greater than our father Jacob, which gave us the well, and drank thereof of himself, and his children, and his cattle?" And Jesus answered and said unto her, "Whosoever drinkketh of this water shall thirst again, but whosoever drinkketh of the water that I shall give him shall never thirst. But the water that I shall give him shall be in him a well of water springing up into everlasting life." &gt;&gt; The woman said unto him, "Sir, give me this water, that I thirst not, neither come hither to draw." And Jesus said unto her, "Go call thy husband, and come hither." The woman answered and said, "I have no husband." Jesus said unto her, "Thou hast well said, I have no husband." For thou hast had five husbands, and he whom thou hast is not thy husband, in that thou, and thou sayest thou truly. The woman said unto him, Sir, I perceive that thou art a prophet. Our fathers worshiped in this mountain, and ye say that in Jerusalem is the place where men ought to worship. And Jesus said unto her,"Woman, believe me, the hour cometh when you shall neither in this mountain nor yet at Jerusalem worship the Father. Ye worship ye not know not what we know what we worship, for salvation is of the Jews. But the hour cometh, and now is, when the true worshipper shall worship the Father in spirit and in truth. For the Father seeketh such to worship him. God is a spirit, and they that worship him must worship him in spirit and in truth. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And the woman said unto him, I know that the Messiah cometh, which is called Christ, when he has come, he shall tell us all things. Jesus said unto her, I that speak unto thee am he. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And upon this came his disciples, and marveled that he talked with the woman. Yet no man said, Why, what seekest thou? Or why talkst thou with her? The woman then left her water pot, went her way into the city, and saith to the man, Come see a man which told me all things that ever I did. Is this is not this the Christ? &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; It's almost enough to have had a service already. God bless you as you have your seats. You know, sometimes coming before a congregation, incidentally, I want to say to everyone that's gathered here, I don't want you to ever think of coming here to church as simply, you know, we're gather uh as individuals having fellowship. That's wonderful. But I want you to feel much closer. I want you to feel that you are an integral part of a body. I want you feel a certain level of commitment. Say this is my life. These are my people. This is where I fellowship. This is where I worship. This is where I receive spiritual food. That's way we want to feel that way. &gt;&gt; Amen. I want to take this scripture uh because and if you'll forgive me, I just I want to express some very very personal uh thoughts uh for a moment. Uh I I feel this way about believers. I feel that uh there are most wonderful group of people uh in the world. I feel that they have such a unique belief and faith and message because no one else has followed and heard a vindicated prophet like they have &gt;&gt; like you have and because I feel that way I feel that the people are very special. That's not enough to say oh you're special you're special because now I want to take the other side. I feel that there's very much lacking uh and if we individually each of us individually if we and I've said this before but I want to uh be more clearly uh have it more clearly defined. If each of us now said uh I said put down on a list and think real deep for a few moments. What is your deepest and most important thing in life? What is the most important thing if you could change something or you would like to change or you would like to receive? Uh where would you like to go? What would you like to be? What would you what would you like to attain to in God? Uh at what spiritual level? What is it that you really want from him? I am absolutely convinced that the things which you would begin to list even if you put them and prioritize them they would start with spiritual thing. your spiritual life, something to do with your walk with God would be right at the top of the list. And I'm sure that that's in God's mind. And so, because we desire that, &gt;&gt; and because we've not quite attained to it, that's what I'm referring to. And I believe that we come here to the house of God to hear things that might even sound a little strange or a little difficult for us to grasp. But if we will only think on those things. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I think of the great inventions that happened and the great things that have taken place in the world in the natural world. You know, you know why we have what we have? Somebody sat down one day and thought about it. Amen. &gt;&gt; We're flying in airplanes because, you know, the Wright brothers and a whole lot of other brothers thought about it &gt;&gt; and they looked at the bugs and they looked at the flies and they looked at the birds and they said, "We ought to be able to do that." And they thought about it. And by going through that thought process and they wouldn't stop until that thought process brought tremendous changes &gt;&gt; to society to the world simply because somebody got thinking about it. &gt;&gt; Now there are some people that get something in their mind and they think about it and they think about it and they think about it and brother Brandham talked to them and said if you continue with that you'll go insane. So that was going to take them in completely a different direction. &gt;&gt; So it wasn't constructive. It wasn't beneficial. It wasn't they were just going to go insane if they harbored that and thought about it. And so our our power of thinking is incredibly important and and and and has effects upon us far beyond our understanding. I believe that. And that's kind of where I'm going to be going uh this morning. I spoke uh on conditions for change and that's what I'm going to speak about right now. Uh what what does change mean and how does it come about? Uh I understand that just from some of the meaning to change is to become different or to make something different or to make somebody different to exchange to substitute or replace something to make something pass from one state to another. As brother Brandham in the future home, which I'm in a great deal in the future home this morning, he said that the world will pass away and the heavens will pass away with a great noise. So he said, well, they're not actually annihilated. Nothing happens to the frame. He said he simply that he Satan is removed from it. &gt;&gt; The same as he took the devil away from you. He takes Satanise &gt;&gt; Satan's effect off of the earth &gt;&gt; and it passes away, but it passes into another into another realm. It passes not into another place in the universe, but it just passes into a a a new and that's why the Bible says he'll make a new heaven and a new earth. &gt;&gt; Uh I want to bring one aspect here. I'm laying I'm just going to be ponderous for a few moments to get get certain principled foundation thoughts down. During the last uh US election, it was President Obama which actually was swept, I would say, on a on a frenzy of euphoria because it was change. You know, we want change. And so a whole nation of over 300 million people, not all of them voted for him, but it was a sweep of the people. Now, what I want to bring to you is that you can speak a certain word. Change. Even here in the congregation this morning, I could say change. We want change. But it would have a whole myriad of meetings. Whole myriad. Because what what perhaps this brother wants is not exactly what this brother wants. What this sister expects isn't what that sister expects. We all have different expectations. So we could say, "Yeah, yeah, change." And millions, yeah, we all want change and we're all swept away on it and but but what this guy wants and what this person wants and what that what that state expects and this state expects are completely different. And so then as time goes on, and politicians know this so well, they're so fine-tuned to it, you know, they know right well it's not going to happen. &gt;&gt; They'll try to do, you know, what what they can do, but there's a whole lot in in and much of what was put forward was we're going to bring our boys back from Iraq. Wonderful. Well, oh, there's hundreds of thousands that are in favor of that. we're going to uh you know bring dignity and uh seek to bring equality to the working man and the bluecollar worker. And so the unions got on the bandwagon. Yeah, change. We want this kind of change. And then uh part of the platform was uh Medicare and we got ahead Medicare for everybody and there's millions that are sick and they said, "Yay, that's the kind of change we want." Well, then as time went on, when the boys didn't come home, there was a bunch of disillusioned people, didn't change the way they wanted. And when maybe everybody didn't get their uh medical needs met, they weren't satisfied. And so now a whole bunch of people start to be disenchanted and disillusioned because the word means so many different things. So now we talk spiritually. We can say the coming of the Lord. Oh, the coming of the Lord. And the whole Christian community says, "Yay, we're all here for the coming of the Lord." One expects them on a cloud coming down. Another one says, "He's already here." And another one's got that they got them all over the place. &gt;&gt; You understand what I mean? So the phrase the coming of the Lord, it just depends what it means to you or what it means to this person or the next person. And so it's it's not just the thought because we can make a phrase, we can make a statement and then we we we've got it all figured out what it is. &gt;&gt; Oh, there's so many places I could go here. You just have to help me a little bit now. So somebody can say, uh, a pastor. &gt;&gt; Oh, yeah. Yeah. I need a pastor. And then everybody has a different reason for needing a pastor. Some think, "Oh, I've got to sit in church and hear the word of God." And next one says, "He's going to fix my problems. He's going to help me raise my kids. Going to tell me what to do. Going to tell me if I should buy a car or not." Some so I've had people and they told me they said their pastor, "I couldn't even go on vacation till I would discuss it with the pastor if I could go on a vacation at a certain time or I felt I should buy a car." And they would go and discuss it with the pastor. Well, I'll tell you folks, if you intend to buy a car, don't come and talk to me. If you want to take a vacation, don't talk to me. Uh, you know, where the pastors called for certain things, but it depends what people have in their mind from the phrase, &gt;&gt; you know, we want change or or we we want a certain government or or whatever more. are so many things that uh that the people and so it's it is not only the word but it's what the word means to the individual people and I would say that today so many are in their expectation of their own brand uh of of of what they expect to happen now so when the results when the results are different from the expectation uh right away then a person's thoughts change because uh at one time they say I'm in favor of this person I'm in favor of this leader I'm in favor of this political party and then or I'm in favor of this church or I'm in favor of this doctrine because it seems to suit what I think it should it should today uh whether even when it comes to spiritual things and so I will say that untold multitudes have spiritual expectations that simply will not happen. Right. &gt;&gt; I've been thinking I've been think I I have given quite a bit of thought recently because I think of all the people every once in a while I look at the orbituary page and I see all the pictures of the people on there. We don't get a newspaper. Once in a while I get it on the weekend paper. They always have the orbituary. In this country, we never used to have pictures, but what have been over in other foreign countries. I always saw they had big pictures and big elaborate pictures of the people that died and the story of their life. And I I found the pictures very interesting. Now you see the pictures and they have it here in the Vancouver Sun. So you see all kinds of pictures of the people. I know I know that the one who stood in front of their families and the mourers and the loved ones said nice things about those people. I've conduct a lot of funerals and I know that they will strive to put the person in heaven or put them in a nice place. And I think what a serious position for a minister to stand up and have to lie &gt;&gt; to the people. It's true &gt;&gt; because for the most part, for the most part, and I'm not anybody's judge, but according to the scripture, few there are that are saved. &gt;&gt; And brother Brandham, now he stressed that. And I was listening to him the other day and uh he said, "A man came to me and said, "Brother Brandon, you really shook me because you said there's so few that'll be saved." Amen. And he said, "Well, that's right." He said, "Now, in the ark, there were eight." And but he says, "But that was a type of the church with with with Enoch there was one." Now, we're we're not, you know, speaking about numbers per se, but nevertheless, that is a that's a very significant truth. So, it's not just we're not just here to be a a glob of people. We're not here just to have a good time and we're not here just to shake hands with one another. We're here to hear truth &gt;&gt; regardless of what it shake how it shakes us &gt;&gt; or how it strips us. &gt;&gt; Friends, I will sooner hear truth &gt;&gt; and know that my soul is saved &gt;&gt; and know that I'm being brought into shape and into condition. &gt;&gt; I want to hear what God has to say about us. That's what I'm concerned about. When Jesus started to speak to this woman, he wasn't, you know, becoming uh, shall I say, emotional and saying you've had a hard time and you've had a hard life and I know that you'd like to be you want to be happy and have joy and you've had so many reversals in life and and which would have been the way that so many of the religious people and even within the message would approach it and you know get sympathetic with Jesus wasn't that way. He just told her plainly. And when she recognized he was a prophet, and this is how she recognized when he said, "You spoken right. You haven't a husband. You've had five. And the one you have right now is not your husband." In other words, you're a prostitute. &gt;&gt; You're living in sin. &gt;&gt; He He knew what the word of God could say about it. He He said, and he just told her the truth. That was the only way to get her to his objective. &gt;&gt; That was the only way to get her was to deal with the truth &gt;&gt; concerning it. &gt;&gt; And so, Brother Brandham speaks about straight as the gate. He says there's sure going to be some great disappointments at the judgment. Oh, he said the bootleggger, he knows where he's going to be at at the judgment. So does the beer hound knows where he's going to be. So does the prostitute know where she'll stand. So does the gambler know where he'll stand. So does the drunkard know where he'll stand. He'll not be disappointed. But where the disappointment is going to be is those who at the judgment where they thought they were right. &gt;&gt; You know, so it's not enough for us just to think that we're right. You want to know in your heart of hearts, &gt;&gt; I am believing this word with all. It's not a matter of doing a lot of things. It's a matter of how you believe. What's in your mind? &gt;&gt; I believe it. &gt;&gt; Do you believe? &gt;&gt; So he said that's where the disappointment now in God is his own interpreter. You'll just have to follow very very close and say, "Oh God, give me capacity for thought just now." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; God is his own interpreter. &gt;&gt; He said, "Now all we are today is the display of the attributes in God. &gt;&gt; All of us, all we are, we're a display of his attributes." First, he was not even God. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; I'll I'll put it here. I have it for you. So, why don't we do it that way? And here's the quote. Now, all we are today is the display of his attributes in God. First, he was not even God. We just have to call him the eternal one. Now friends, this is where we have to start. This isn't uh this is like a a a lesson. But a prophet of God is teaching us these things. He said because the English word God means object of worship and there was nothing to worship him. So he was the eternal one, &gt;&gt; the main fountain of all intelligence. Yes sir. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And in this fountain of all intelligence, there was not an atom, molecule or nothing, light, nowhere, star, moon, nothing else. God, what we know as God, the great spirit that was eternal, never did begin, never did end, he was there. And in him was attributes. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; It was attributes to be God. &gt;&gt; See, he wasn't a God yet. There was nothing to worship, but he had an attribute to be God. &gt;&gt; Attributes to be a father, attributes to be a son, attributes to be a savior, attributes to be a healer. &gt;&gt; All these attributes was in him. These things that was unfolded, these things that has unfolded since then are just his attributes being made manifest. &gt;&gt; So it's a God this great fountain. You know, I have so much difficulty thinking of of a being that never began. &gt;&gt; I have problem with that. And a being that never ends. Eternal eternity really uh uh gives me difficulty mentally is I always feel something has to start someplace but God never had a beginning. &gt;&gt; So I just have to declare what he says about it. &gt;&gt; This great fountain and he had an attribute in him to be worshiped. He had an attribute to be God. &gt;&gt; And so, uh, an attribute to be a son and to be all of these things. Now, in uh in the future home, Brother Brandham, I'm I'm going to just take you on a little bit of a journey. He said, "I can't say post lest I think post." &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; I can't say man lest I think man. And when I think of man, then I say man. He said the thinking and here we go. The thinking is my attribute. Now I'm not talking about God's attribute. I talking about his your attribute. The thinking is my attribute and the expression is the word. &gt;&gt; So he says I think I can't say post unless I think post. So he thinks post or I think man. So I think of man and then he expresses it and says man or we think I may think I think vile brother vile. Now I speak it and I I express what I thought but the thought was the attribute. Now I could think it and not say it. &gt;&gt; Okay. &gt;&gt; So but the thought your thought is the attribute. &gt;&gt; It's powerful. So the attribute or thought is God's and the expression or word is through the prophet. &gt;&gt; Amen. Now many of you wonder how that discernment comes and I'm going to tell you. &gt;&gt; Amen. Now, just hear me real good for a moment. &gt;&gt; The discernment, we call it the discernment or the revealing of the secret of the heart. When Jesus was at the well with the woman, that is the one thing, the only thing he did was revealed the secret of her heart. &gt;&gt; Amen. There was nothing supernatural about the water or the well or the bucket or the rope. Are you greater than Jacob who gave us this well? None of none of that would be moving her into another dimension. None of that would bring change &gt;&gt; to her. She came a prostitute. She was going to go a prostitute. She came living with a man who wasn't her husband. And she would go living with a man who wasn't her husband. None of that would change. We have become very very spoiled in that we've heard messages and heard prayer lines etc etc for for decades and for years and years and years and it it it begins to come a very very common place but I want to just say to the congregation once again today that was God Almighty &gt;&gt; coming on the scene &gt;&gt; to separate &gt;&gt; brother Brandham's ministry from all other ministries. &gt;&gt; Exactly. Right. &gt;&gt; To separate it and to identify it as to be the mouthpiece that was going to speak the mystery secrets of the word of God. &gt;&gt; The the God was identifying a mouthpiece that this this mouthpiece is going to speak my thoughts. &gt;&gt; Thoughts that I've held back. Thoughts that I have concerning the end time. thoughts I have concerning specifically, especially those people that are going to be drawn to the voice from this messenger. &gt;&gt; I have special things to say to them. &gt;&gt; I'm going to attract them. Multitudes of others have been attracted, but there's going to be some that will be attracted differently, and they won't understand the attraction. But I want to bring them into the channel of my thought. And I'll have a vessel here that will speak my thought. &gt;&gt; And that thought will change those people. That thought will even change their bodies because my thought has control over the atoms of their system. My thought has control over the cancer that Satan has tried to impose upon them. My thought is more powerful than the demons of hell that are trying to hold them and bind them. My thought when they come in contact, they won't understand it, but they will be free. They will be changed. Is it not true? &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. [Music] [Applause] &gt;&gt; I said now, brother Brandham comes to this. He said, "You've wondered." &gt;&gt; Many of you wonder how that discernment comes. And I'm going to tell you, it's a word that I say &gt;&gt; and it isn't my thinking. &gt;&gt; I've been pondering this one very, very deep. &gt;&gt; It's a word that I say &gt;&gt; but it doesn't come through his mind. &gt;&gt; I even wondered. I said, "Lord, how does he say a word? &gt;&gt; How do I speak a word without my thinking?" &gt;&gt; And I got thinking back. I got re into my memory and thinking back, I I've prayed with people. I've prayed myself. And then something just overwhelms you. And you say, "Oh, God, help me. I'm a sinner." &gt;&gt; But you never even thought about it. &gt;&gt; You didn't sit and think, "I'm a sinner. I think I'll say I'm a sinner." Like brother Brandham says, "I can't say a post unless I think I'm a post or I think of a post." I said, "I just I have to think of it first." But when a person comes under the very uh under the dominion of the Holy Ghost, they'll start saying things that they're not thinking about. &gt;&gt; It doesn't even come to your mind. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. In the natural, in the natural, your own mind might be saying, "You're a failure. You're a miserable, hopeless wretch." But there's something in you that says, "I'm this blood, &gt;&gt; son and daughter of God." &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And that's how people when they are even on a on a deathbed. &gt;&gt; If a if the revelation of the truth of God's word, they can't they they think I'm sick. I'm weak. I'm frail. But something and it's not even a thought. But out of their mouth, they say a word. I'm healed. &gt;&gt; I receive it. &gt;&gt; The promise is true. &gt;&gt; And the devil is a liar. Yes. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Listen friends, &gt;&gt; it works. &gt;&gt; And so he said, "It's not my thought. &gt;&gt; It's a word that I say." And brother Brandham had to say so many words that never came into his mind as a thought. &gt;&gt; And even when he come out, he said, "I don't know what I said." because his memory channel didn't have like when you speak something then in a moment or two later your memory channel has access to that because it's in the past but he would speak things but even the memory channel which is in the in the in the realm of the spirit had no access &gt;&gt; back to that &gt;&gt; think of it isn't that marvelous &gt;&gt; and he said he said to me personally he said it's like a record and unless un it's like it has to play again and unless God will play it again, he said, then I can't remember it. I can't recall it. He hasn't got any recall facility for this kind of thing because it's God's attribute. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. We don't have automatic access into God's mind just to draw a thought when we want to. But when God makes his thoughts known to us, my brother, my sister, we want to jump on the bandwagon. say, "I'm here to catch all that God has to say." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; So, so he said, "Because it it isn't my thinking because I don't know. I don't know of the thinking of it. How can I tell you where you were and and came from when I don't know you? How can I tell you what you done 10 years ago &gt;&gt; when I never seen you in my life? &gt;&gt; How can I tell you where you where you do and what you will do 10 years from now? How do I know the future? &gt;&gt; But it is somebody else's thought. &gt;&gt; So it never even comes in his mind. It's not as though God illuminates his mind and he begins to it is a word that he speaks &gt;&gt; and the thought is someone else's &gt;&gt; and he's he's com making a comparison now we think of a certain thing we we think of my car I'm going to go to my car and we speak a certain thing I'm going to after church I'm going to because we've got those thoughts and and the thought is our attribute you may not speak it you don't necessarily utter it but you have thoughts and their attributes. The world is full of men and women's thoughts, &gt;&gt; but they're not God's thoughts. &gt;&gt; They are their personal attributes. &gt;&gt; And they might they might think about something and decide, I'm going to change. I'm going to do this. I'm going to do that. And it may be perfectly fine. It may be great. It's a good thing for them to do. I'm going to take this job. I'm going to take this schooling. I'm going to I'm going to go to this city or whatever more. We can have those thoughts and it's not necessarily God's thoughts. In fact, it's for the most part, it's just human thoughts. Like brother Brandham says now, I take every spirit in this building under my control for the glory of God. &gt;&gt; He brought those spirits under his control. Hallelujah. Those people didn't even realize it. But God came down and took those spirits under his control for the glory of God. So that then the Holy Spirit could come and command the attention of the people. And that discernment which we call discernment which was not discernment per se. He said it is Hebrews where 4:12 where the word of God the word of God. Amen. &gt;&gt; And what is the word of God? The word of God is the attribute being made known. For the word of God now, the word the word the thought was already God already had the thought, but now he's got a vessel on earth through whom he is projecting his word. And the word of God is quick and powerful and sharper than any two-edged sword, piercing even to the dividing aunderder of soul and spirit. Now it's the only thing that can divide us under as I said many times not between body and spirit but between soul and spirit. That is why so many people so many people so much of religion is all caught up with the emotional side of things we feel and you know and that is where our affection and our family relationships and all of these things. And let me say this to this congregation. We do not want to come here and fellowship based on that realm. &gt;&gt; I don't want you here because I'm here or because your wife or somebody else is here. You've got to know in your heart of hearts what is the mind of God concerning you and where you're going to hear the word of God for your life. Amen. &gt;&gt; And this is not speaking uh uh negatively about anyone else or any other people that worship elsewhere. People within the message. They they have all all manner and different reasons for gathering and where they gather and how they gather and their times of their services and it's a whole myriad. Everybody must have their own diet. But you must know what your diet is. definitely must know what your diet is. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And so it's someone else's thought. Now I sincerely believe that we really have no concept of the power of the attribute the thought that God has given us. And that is why the prophet also said that the mind is the battle ground. &gt;&gt; And in this day and age, don't lose me there. I just felt like it was a dark cloud for a moment. The mind is the battleground &gt;&gt; and you should make a daily practice of kicking your enemy out of that battleground. &gt;&gt; He's not there for good. He's there to bring all kinds of worry &gt;&gt; and toil and turmoil and confusion and all kinds of things. &gt;&gt; We need to kick him out and say, "Well, what would you recommend?" I'd recommend saying, "Father, I know you have an attribute, a thought &gt;&gt; concerning this day that I'm living in. &gt;&gt; You have a thought, and I want to know what that thought is. Even if it doesn't come into my mind, help me to speak it. &gt;&gt; Help me to say it. &gt;&gt; Help me to live it. [Applause] &gt;&gt; Whatever he has said about us is exactly what we must say. &gt;&gt; Yes. Now, so the prophet is saying now the thinking is my attribute and the expression is the word. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So I think a post, I say a post. I think a man, I say a man. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Now I want to take it a little bit further with this woman at the well. &gt;&gt; Amen. This is still in a quote. Let this mind be in you which was also in Christ. &gt;&gt; Let it be in you. Let the mind that was in Christ be in you. See then it isn't your thinking. &gt;&gt; It's his thinking through you. &gt;&gt; And you're not expressing your own words. You're expressing his words. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; The supernatural is God's confirmation or agreement &gt;&gt; that the attribute thought and the word confession is one of the same and the same. &gt;&gt; Can we say that again? The supernatural is God's confirmation or agreement that the attribute thought and the word confession is one and the same. That's when you have something happen. &gt;&gt; When a person, when we as a group of people or an individual can move into that channel, &gt;&gt; catch the mind of God. &gt;&gt; You might say, "How do we move into that channel?" I I've been speaking a couple messages now. The messenger is the channel. &gt;&gt; You don't have a history channel and a sports channel and all this. We have a prophet channel. &gt;&gt; That was God's channel. &gt;&gt; God proved who that channel was. &gt;&gt; So, we have the channel. &gt;&gt; Because the woman at the well was an attribute. Jesus the word spoke what the seed what the seed in her heart declared. &gt;&gt; Amen. Now just hold that as we come a little bit further here. Now here is what was in this little woman. She was one of his attributes and there was a priest representing the light and he had learned it from the Bible. He had learned that God was God. He had learned that holiness was right. And he was learned that there was a law of God. He learned it because of intellectual conception. And he was born of the right lineage. He was a Levite. But the but he only knew it only knew it by intellectual conception. They learned that Malachi 4 &gt;&gt; was right. &gt;&gt; They learned that it was to be Luke 17:30. &gt;&gt; And they learned that there was a messenger to to the Leodysian church. And they learned it was the Leodysian church age. And they learned that the conditions of the age actually were there. They learned it and they accepted it. And they were the right lineage. They were born into families and they were they they worked with people and they learned that they learned all of these things. They learned what happened on Sunset Mountain and they they learned how the cloud and they learned all about the cloud and what the cloud was and they learned these things. Let me tell you, it takes a lot more than learning it. &gt;&gt; There's people aren't even in church today that have learned those things. And they can talk to you about that inside out and backwards and upward up and down. They can give quotes and all the rest of it. That's not where it's at, friends. &gt;&gt; I mean, if I if I went and sat down went to my study right now and left you with that, that's as true as it can be. &gt;&gt; And that's why there's a lot of people wonder about within the message. They wonder about, you know, others around them or things that they hear from and say, "Well, how can that be in the message?" It's not in the message. &gt;&gt; That isn't the message. &gt;&gt; You can know all about, we can have learned all about it for years and years. &gt;&gt; I want to say the learning &gt;&gt; is not where it's at. Right. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; So now, Brother Brandham says that he had learned that he had learned that holiness was right and he had learned about God and he was a Levite himself. So he knew he was in position for it. He was in line for it and he had learned all these things. But he had only learned it by intellectual conception. Now God has given us all an intellect. And we hear the word this morning, but it has to go beyond that. And this is where I'm really asking God to help me and to help you especially. I've been pondering this very, very deep for a number of days now. So now the Bible says this concerning her. I guess this is where I need to go. He learned it by what? Brother Brandham says by what had happened, not what was happening. &gt;&gt; And that's where it all hangs. &gt;&gt; He learned it by what had happened. &gt;&gt; So this this had taken place. This is all part of the history, but not what was happening. &gt;&gt; So the woman even at the well, she says to Jesus, she says, "Are you greater than Jacob?" She knew all about Jacob. Who gave us this? Well, she knew all about this was Jacob's well. She knew that Jacob was are you greater than our fathers? She knew that he was the father of the one of the fathers of the faith. She she had a knowledge of these things. She also knew about worship. She said, well, the you know the Samaritans say we should worship in this mountain and the Jews say we should worship in Jerusalem. There was a lot of things that she knew &gt;&gt; and she had learned it also. &gt;&gt; But the one thing that the attribute of God is determined to do is to connect the future or the past with the present. &gt;&gt; Actually make a connection &gt;&gt; and the connection was I am he. [Applause] And brother Vanam said she only had one one little thing down there. &gt;&gt; She only had one little thing. That little seed down there. &gt;&gt; All she knew. And it was a word. &gt;&gt; It was a word. &gt;&gt; And it was somebody else's thought. &gt;&gt; It was not even her own conception because she couldn't figure it out. She said, "I I I I know when the Messiah comes, he'll tell us everything." &gt;&gt; She never learned that &gt;&gt; because she had never experienced it, &gt;&gt; but she just knew when the Messiah comes, when that happens, when when when his coming and and the and and the expectation of the future and the present merge together. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And he said, "I that speak to thee am he." No, &gt;&gt; she didn't say, you know, give me a lesson on that. &gt;&gt; Are you following me this morning? &gt;&gt; I that speak to thee am he. &gt;&gt; And there was a merging together &gt;&gt; of what she had understood. But Jesus Jesus kept moving her because it was that seed that was in her that was the attribute. She was an attribute of God. She was a thought of God. And now the the whole word, the whole word was standing there. &gt;&gt; Jesus was the fullness of the word. &gt;&gt; And I read so many times in this last week, brother Brandon went over and over and over again when he talked about us being an attribute. You're an attribute of his thinking from the beginning. &gt;&gt; But he says, "But when he was here on earth, he was the fullness." So he included all of that that was in God in the beginning. &gt;&gt; And that is why even in this day when he revealed himself again as a son of man, the words that he spoke out, touched and reached something within you because you were an attribute and that and he was called, he was ordained to bring you back. &gt;&gt; In other words, that's how redemption was to take place. &gt;&gt; I hope I'm saying this right. It's such a deep truth to me. You were an attribute in God. And then the prophet said, "That's why you went with him to Calvary. &gt;&gt; You died. You died with him." That's not some little poetic license. You hung on Calvary with him. &gt;&gt; You went to the grave with him &gt;&gt; and you actually raised the third day with him. because he was the fullness and you're a part of the fullness. &gt;&gt; You're an attribute and she was an attribute. And there they both are at the well. The the priest couldn't get it cuz he wasn't an attribute. The prophet said he had no representation. &gt;&gt; But but she was an attribute. And so Jesus just stood there and he just he just pushed aside all of the trouble of her life and all of the sin and all of the confusion and all of the chaos until he uncovered the attribute. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; That's what the word comes for. Amen. &gt;&gt; When you hear the messages and I hear them, I feel I'm not even worthy. &gt;&gt; And oh, I I I I I look again this morning. How many times he said this this ministry, this revealing of the secret of the heart of the people, this is the sign of the resurrection. &gt;&gt; You and I have received the sign of the resurrection. I want to declare to you in front of the whole world today and whoever is streaming, I believe that that was the sign of the resurrection and I have received the sign of the resurrection. &gt;&gt; I've already received it. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. It responds to that seed down inside. &gt;&gt; I may not see all the signs in the world that I want to see. I may not see it happening, unfolding the way I would like to see it unfolding. That's not for us to determine. &gt;&gt; It is for you and I to agree &gt;&gt; with what he said. &gt;&gt; And if he said &gt;&gt; this is a sign of the resurrection, &gt;&gt; if he said this is the last great sign, you can go along every day and say, I am identified with the sign of the resurrection. &gt;&gt; I am identified with the last great sign. I am identified with a messenger who actually spoke the very thoughts of God. Speaking the thoughts of God is speaking the attributes of God. &gt;&gt; And there's no wonder that you responded. If you were an attribute, you had to respond to it. &gt;&gt; You could say, "You're speaking my language, prophet. &gt;&gt; You're speaking my language. &gt;&gt; That's what I understand. Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And that is why &gt;&gt; it is the most amazing thing I have experienced. Brother Milo and I we've been in you know in in Yugoslavia before it became Slovenia and Macedonian, Serbian, Bosnia and all these different states. And I'm just going to make a confession now. I'm a very precise person and milk is a very general person and we all know that. Oh yeah, it'll be fine. Sure. You know, just he said, you know, just a bowl full of cherries with a banana on top or a bowl full of bananas with a cherry on top. And I thought, you know, Milco, be more specific. And I found out it was a trade of the people over there. God bless our brother Larry and I'm sure brother Jonathan is translating right now. But I was so anxious to know because he was translating the message and brother Brandham and brother Brandham's message and brother Mila would read it and he said, "Oh, this is so perfect, so wonderful." And I had such difficulty because brother Lar didn't speak English. He didn't speak English. And I had I was in a dilemma. And not only that, you know, Milco remembers I said, "How can it be so perfect? How can the translation be perfect when he doesn't speak English?" &gt;&gt; He said, "I don't know, but it's beautiful." &gt;&gt; And after a few years, Mila won out. I lost because he I'm not Serbian. I'm not Croatian. He can read the language. He can read English book. I didn't have that advantage. He just said it's perfect. It's just beautiful. These can be translated and these can be printed. And that's exactly what's happened. Those very messages been translated been printed. So, one time I was in brother uh Eva's car. We were driving. Were we in Germany, weren't we? Had been in a had he came up from Yugoslavia to Germany and we were in a convention. And so, Brother Mila was there and I wanted to find out how the message was doing. And I'm always very keen on how it's, you know, how the translations are happening, how the books are being distributed because you're so anxious for others to enjoy this wonderful truth. So I said, "Brother Eva, how is the message, you know, how is the message uh happening? How is it taking place? How is it progressing in in uh in your country, in your area? There's quietness for a little while. He said, "Well, I live in a little village by the sea." And I thought, "What does this have to do with it? I want to know how the message is doing. He's telling me I live in a little village by the sea." And he's going to start telling me a story. You remember it? And I just kind of give up right then. I wasn't I wasn't prepared to go all the way from a village by the sea to what was happening, right? I wanted to know exactly what was taking place at that time. But I learned a great lesson. You might say to me, "Well, how how how does that work?" I don't know how that works. But I I can tell you that I have been in places I've been in Malawi and I've been in Zimbabwe and in places in Africa where the people didn't have a real good grasp of the of the perhaps the language. But it was incredible how the Holy Spirit gave them accuracy &gt;&gt; in translating the message &gt;&gt; because somehow they could catch the spirit of it. I don't know how. I'm not going to go any further than that, but I'm going to tell you that that has happened. &gt;&gt; And that is one place that I know it has happened. And there's many of those books that our brother Larga translated and they're the ones that are probably on the hub today and everything else. &gt;&gt; You see, it is the it is God has his own way. When brother Brandham, I want you to think about this. He said, "I just say a word." And this is where we kind of get lost. I'm kind of lost myself. But I just say a word. But I can tell you that it's very it's very very possible. It's very possible. It's a reality for a person. And I have experienced that many times here at the pulpit or praying. You start praying for someone and while you're praying or you might be at home praying over a situation and you get into prayer and you're speaking and finally you realize that it's bypassed your mind &gt;&gt; and you start to say things &gt;&gt; and even your mind I be I pray for people this is one thing that happens quite frequently I pray for people and when you're pray in prayer and other people are praying and then suddenly Even my mind catches that the words that are coming out &gt;&gt; are not my own words, &gt;&gt; not my own thoughts. &gt;&gt; Right &gt;&gt; now, you're going to think that I'm really, really gone off the deep end. Sometimes, and this is not unusual either, uh a man of God, I can only speak about myself. You get preaching and the preaching and the word it starts coming and the Holy Spirit and it just starts flowing through you and you're speaking and saying things not in your notes and not in your mind. In fact is my mind feels like it's over here independent and I'm listening to what's being said &gt;&gt; and I actually have heard whole statement and my mind said that was good. In other words, I got blessed after the fact. Now you're going to think we're really in a loony place. No. No. The prophets spoke things that they didn't know. and they didn't understand. And brother Brandham said, "If they had known what they were saying, they would in no wise have said it." So they didn't have a comprehension. They didn't have what I'm trying to say is that and to bring to you today, friends, it's it's not just that we have a learning. It's not just that we have a history in the message. But the the what we have in the message and what we should really fully realize is that these are attributes of God. The thought is the attribute. And it's so glorious to me to think that God would rear up a man, raise a man that didn't have good learning. &gt;&gt; And kept saying, "I have a hard time reading. I only have a grade seven education." So God even saw to it that he was he was uh uh uh hindered in that in that aspect. And yet you talk about speak things. You get into the future home of the heavenly bridegroom, earthly bride. Brother Brandham says more in three pages than Bible schools teach in years. &gt;&gt; You just wonder where does this wisdom come from? What is this man tapped into? I can tell you he's tapped right into the very mind of almighty God. &gt;&gt; And he's bringing to us. And when you hear the messages and you hear it preached and you hear it declared by God's servants reminding you and and impressing you that that is not just a sermon that is not just a book and people think of it where some kind of cult or whatever they can think what they want to think but this there is no message on earth that has been so powerfully vindicated by God himself. And that's why he says, "How can I tell you where you're from and where you were 10 years ago and what you're going to do 10 years from now?" What he's trying to say, that is the dividing line. &gt;&gt; That is the separating line. &gt;&gt; That's what declares this is God's thought. &gt;&gt; Friends, that has never happened. &gt;&gt; Never happened in the history of mankind. &gt;&gt; We ought to wake up. We ought to be fully aware. say, "Oh God, why did you do this in this generation? This must be a very significant time." It is. &gt;&gt; It's resurrection time &gt;&gt; and it's the change we all have been waiting for &gt;&gt; and they shall be changed and God said because in God's mind he had in his mind I'm going to change them. &gt;&gt; And so he had apostle Paul says we will all be changed. But then in the end time he sends a messenger with exactly the ministry of Jesus Christ exactly with the same ministry out of the same atmosphere and environment out of poverty out of the wilderness a man of the wilderness. All the very same characteristics of Elijah. He sent it to for one purpose. Not so brother Brandham could hunt and do a number of things but so that we could look back and identify This is the mouthpiece &gt;&gt; to tell us of the hour that we're in &gt;&gt; so we can bring the past and tie it together with the present. &gt;&gt; That one who was speaking to the woman at the well. That is the one who has called you and I. &gt;&gt; That is the one who has spoken in this age. &gt;&gt; That is the one who used a prophet messenger. That is the one whose words himself is life and life eternal. Hallelujah. And so I can say to you, I'm not looking forward to the resurrection. The resurrection's already here in the in the power of the word that's already been spoken. The word for the change is already here. The word for the rapture is already present. The past and the present have united together. &gt;&gt; And we're not speaking by intellectual what has happened. We're speaking about what is happening. Amen. &gt;&gt; And that's the difference. That's why we're here at church this morning. You can say, "What did you do at church?" I found out about things that are happening. &gt;&gt; I'm involved with what is happening. &gt;&gt; The woman, she proved she was an attribute by identifying what was happening, what is happening. &gt;&gt; And the priest, he only knew what had happened. Far be it &gt;&gt; from Cloverdale Bible Way to have become identified as a church. Oh, we know about Sabina Canyon and we know about this place. Nothing wrong with those places. I've been there myself. That's we're we're not that's we're not living on a historical plane. We're not even living about the phenomena. We're living in how that relates to now right now. And friends, you need to pray for the ministry. We need a ministry who can identify those things in the scripture and say, "This is where we're at &gt;&gt; because that's what's going to inspire faith in your heart to believe because it is by fearing. And it is by faith that cometh by hearing." And you will be inspired to believe. This is the time and this is the hour. Not whether it's today or tomorrow. I don't care. But I'm in the present. &gt;&gt; I'm in the present. &gt;&gt; This word is a present word. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. [Music] &gt;&gt; How wonderful. We've had all I can say over and over and over and over again. Never tired of it. We've had the God sent channel. &gt;&gt; How important is that? Without that channel, there is no change. If &gt;&gt; you don't identify that channel and believe in that channel, &gt;&gt; there is no change. &gt;&gt; This will never come through a university. This will never come through learning. This will never come through school. Never come even through preaching. It'll come by a minister just being able to get before God and saying, "There it is, folks. &gt;&gt; There's the light there. &gt;&gt; There's the angel there. Follow him. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Follow this word. It'll bring about the change in your life, in your character, and in your body. [Applause] &gt;&gt; Glory. &gt;&gt; Glory to God. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Now, I I won't have time to go all into this, but just some things for you to think about and go home and go back and study it. In the restoration of the bride tree. In the restoration of the bride tree. Brother Brandham he reads uh two main scriptures. He reads in Joel where the palmer worm and the canker worm and so on. Those four had eaten the tree. And he talked how about they how they had eaten the tree. Jesus was the tree of life. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But they couldn't destroy it. The life went back to the roots and came back up. &gt;&gt; He talks about the bride tree which was in Eden. &gt;&gt; And now it's being restored again. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Now he's saying it's being restored again. &gt;&gt; Now you might think me overboard, but I'm staying with this channel. Now, this channel, here's this channel, this identified channel, none like it. He's not talking about philosophy, and he's not talking about how to live better. And this is not a social gospel. We've got a channel now. &gt;&gt; Who is who's speaking about the restoration of the bride tree? He says she's being restored again. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; All right. And that's why I'm tying it to future home as well. He reads two scriptures. And the one scripture is out of Joel which says I will restore again. And then he goes the second scriptures in Genesis where uh uh Abraham takes Sarah and they go down into Egypt into Gerrar and the Aimilec the young king he said sees her as beautiful as she is and he says she's a grandma but she sees beautiful and and uh this is about two different occasions and Abraham arranged with her with Sarah that you'll be my sister but she was a halfsister. but you'll be my sister because they might kill me." And so she goes down as as his sister. And the princess and so on saw her so fair and beautiful took her to Pharaoh and uh and uh the king Aimilec and Aimilec now he's brother Brandham describes getting ready for the evening and maybe put his pajamas on and whatever more. And God speaks to him &gt;&gt; and says, "You're as good as a dead man." &gt;&gt; Right. Now we have a messenger. Please stay with me now. Close. We have a messenger now that is bringing this out to the surface. That's not come out like that before. &gt;&gt; So he's actually he's an announcing messenger. He's saying back there now that's happening again. Amen. &gt;&gt; See Joel, it was it was Apostle Peter stood up on the day of Pentecost and he could read back to Joel where Joel says, "In the last day, Seth God, I'll pour out my spirit upon all men." And so he went, it wasn't something he had just learned, but now he picked up what he had learned and united it with the present. And that is when the learning has it has it has effectiveness when it's united with what is happening. So this is that which was spoken of by Joel the prophet. Now brother Brandham goes to Joel and he says I will restore Seth the Lord. &gt;&gt; And then he goes to Genesis now. So he takes uh the the scripture refers to the whole body of believers. But then he takes a scripture that refers to Abraham's wife and God speaks to Aimilec and he says restore the man his wife. God has issued an edict upon this generation through a prophet's messenger. And there's not enough devils in hell to hold back any member of the body of Jesus Christ, the bride of Christ, because God has told the devil, "You're as good as a dead man anyway. You are destined for hell, and you are going to restore every one of my kids. You're going to restore them back. You can't hold them. Why? This is the time. This is the hour. And I sent my messenger with a decree. Give her up. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And that you have to know whether you're young or middle-aged or family or elderly, whatever it is, you have to know that this this whole generation is under a decree &gt;&gt; of Elijah, &gt;&gt; the messenger. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Who is a who was ordained to reveal Jesus Christ, &gt;&gt; the bridegroom, speaking through him to this generation. Give her back. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. There's nothing can hold you. &gt;&gt; And let that be in your thoughts. &gt;&gt; That is the attribute of God. &gt;&gt; That's the thought of God for this generation. &gt;&gt; And this we've got the right channel. &gt;&gt; We've got the right time. &gt;&gt; Amen. And we've got the right people. &gt;&gt; You've been called by that word. &gt;&gt; Don't let that ever leave you. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; That's thus sayaith the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Isn't that wonderful? [Applause] &gt;&gt; Oh, that's so wonderful. Thank you. &gt;&gt; We can just worship him and thank him. [Applause] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; You just want to enter into that, friends. God sent us for you. &gt;&gt; He sent us for you for this time. &gt;&gt; Amen. And that is why &gt;&gt; and I really must close but but that is why in the future home you have to if you could read the messages and see them and put them all in that perspective. This is not a sermon. This not just a message by brother Brandham. This happens to be God issuing a decree. &gt;&gt; I've called my bride. I've shown who I am. &gt;&gt; I expressed and manifested myself clearly. &gt;&gt; I did everything I did in the Bible. I did it all again. &gt;&gt; I revealed the secrets of the hearts. I told the people. I healed them. The whatever whatever condition, nothing could stand before his prayers. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Because it wasn't a man. &gt;&gt; It was God in the man. &gt;&gt; It wasn't his thoughts. This is not my thoughts. &gt;&gt; I don't know what I'm saying, &gt;&gt; but he spoke &gt;&gt; and it happened. &gt;&gt; And then he comes and begins to tell a people who have been called out &gt;&gt; by this voice. Begins to tell them now of a future home and what it's going to be like and how how Apostle Peter spoke about it. But Apostle John, he just referred to it. I make a new heavens and a new earth. But Apostle Peter speaks about how it's going to happen and how the earth is going to be on fire and how it's going to belch and it won't lose its it's a it won't lose its identify in it as its framework the same as God cleaned you up. But you didn't lose your framework. He just took the sin away from you and he took you away from Satan. He's going to take the world away from Satan. And that's why the heavens are going to be on fire. Oh my friends, this is a time for us to rejoice. &gt;&gt; Every demon spirit &gt;&gt; is going to be annihilated. &gt;&gt; Every spirit &gt;&gt; that's ever tormented you. &gt;&gt; Every evil thought that ever came your way, &gt;&gt; the source of that thought is will be gone forever. &gt;&gt; And I don't want to just speak about a pie in the sky. I'm here to tell you that God's messenger, his validated messenger, has already put the earth under the decree. &gt;&gt; It's as good as finished. &gt;&gt; God's already declared it. &gt;&gt; And friends, you might say, "Well, a minister can get up and say that." That's not a minister got up and said that. &gt;&gt; The attribute from God, God thought about the world being renewed. God thought about him coming back to the earth, &gt;&gt; not to the Eden that fell, but he thought of thought of himself coming back to a multitude of people that would be sons and daughters, and he's going to live with them, and they're going to worship him. &gt;&gt; It's already been decreed &gt;&gt; by his validated voice. &gt;&gt; It's already been decreed. &gt;&gt; You might say, "What can I do?" Agree with it. &gt;&gt; Say, "I believe that. Let something well up within you and say, "Yay and amen. &gt;&gt; I believe that. &gt;&gt; A new heaven &gt;&gt; and a new earth." &gt;&gt; In the midst of all this ungodliness and darkness, &gt;&gt; wherein dwells righteousness, &gt;&gt; let us say that. Wherein dwells righteousness a new heaven and a new earth. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; There will be no more death. There'll be no more mounds of soil on the hillside. There'll be no more earthquakes such as Haiti. There'll be no more tsunamis. There'll be no more cyclones. The prince of the power of the air will be bound and destroyed. Hallelujah. God has sent his messenger to declare that this is the time. [Applause] Glory. &gt;&gt; Glory. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; God sent you his best &gt;&gt; with the announcement. [Music] [Applause] And let me even say &gt;&gt; even as Tommy Osburn who wasn't able to receive the fullness of the message &gt;&gt; he said it is brother Brandis memorial he said I'll be misunderstood &gt;&gt; but he said God walked through this generation [Applause] &gt;&gt; and he said don't misunderstand me &gt;&gt; there won't be another &gt;&gt; and I say amen to that there won't be another. &gt;&gt; There's not another messenger. &gt;&gt; There will be no other voice like this. You'll never have a series of,00 tapes or messages like this. You'll never have someone else be able to elaborate on the future home the way this messenger told you about the future home. And he declared clearly that you are being restored back even now &gt;&gt; to the bride tree. back to Eden. &gt;&gt; I'll make this announcement. You are on your way &gt;&gt; back to Eden again. &gt;&gt; And this word is the empowers you. This word you just step on it and this word is taking you there. &gt;&gt; You don't have to try to get there. This word will take you there. This word will change you. This word will rapture you if this word will resurrect you if you die. We have it all, friends. We have it all. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Why don't we just stand to our feet? Give him praise. Hallelujah. He's provided everything. [Applause] &gt;&gt; He's provided everything that we have here. &gt;&gt; Glory. Glory. &gt;&gt; Oh, glory. [Music] &gt;&gt; What grace is this and what power is this? You'd send us to a wretched people such a message as you have. &gt;&gt; Oh God, &gt;&gt; give us a mighty voice. &gt;&gt; Give us a voice that will reach the winds of the earth. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; I want the church to be in prayer for the meetings in Switzerland. God is doing marvelous things, great and glorious things. He's raising up an army of people that have been in the message for years, but they have been quickened by the Holy Spirit. praying for the ministers, the pastors, brother Frasar and also brother Jean Jax and other ministers that will be taking place. Oh, we pray that God will so inspire the ministers that will be there for these meetings up into Germany with brother Garald and about three weeks later into Moscow where the church has been built and they're just there sitting on little rough benches. They've built and worked hard all winter, but they're going to have the dedication, Lord willing, May one. Pray God send a mighty voice &gt;&gt; through those people through Russia and the surrounding nations. Oh, what a day that will be, friends, when the gates swing open wide and the redeemed are marching in, marching home. Oh, to be in that number. Oh, to be in that number. Glorious, glorious Jesus Christ. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Are you in that number? &gt;&gt; Not how you feel, but are you in that number? Tell the devil, I'm in that number. I'm out of your reach. I'm beyond the scope of your grip. You cannot hold me. Tell the devil he's under a decree. Elijah has brought a decree upon him. You've lost your power. &gt;&gt; Tell the devil what Elijah said. You're a bluff. &gt;&gt; Tell your sickness what God's attribute thought about it. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; There be no more sickness. &gt;&gt; Glory to God. Glory to God. Glory to God. How about we just sing in I'm in that number. I'm in that number. &gt;&gt; I'm in that number. I'm in that number. I'm in that number. Roll in. I'm in that number. I'm in that number. I'm in that number rolling. I'm in that number that was in that number. And in that number that was the first and in that number John saw that number that was number John saw that number rolling John saw that number that was John saw that number. &gt;&gt; I tell you what, brother Brandham said, "I saw you all over there." &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Is that just a Is that just a little bit of &gt;&gt; poetic life? Is that a reality? &gt;&gt; So, you over there. &gt;&gt; What joy is this? Amen. &gt;&gt; All right. &gt;&gt; Over there, friends. &gt;&gt; Not here at home in Cloverdale, Washington or wherever. Mary'sville, Seattle, Tacoma, Abbottzford, wherever. No, he saw us over there. &gt;&gt; Brother never said, "I saw you here struggling and I saw you here failing and I saw you here in all your misery." No, he said, "I saw you there. [Music] Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; There's even a place in British Columbia that I don't think but very very few people, very few ever see, ever saw. And I've lived here all my life pretty well, but I never saw it till I was up there and we took Brother Brandham up with Brother Southwick. If I could describe it to you, it'd be hard for you to believe, but it would be right on top of the mountain ridges. They call it alpine country, but it's more than alpine. And it just grass and flowers so delicate. So delicate. About half the size of my fingernail. Just tiny pink. I put my camera down, took pictures of these flowers. I sat there and and saw them just coming and cropping up out of the shale and out of the rock and I thought, "Oh, God, why do these things even happen here?" The most delicate, magnificent flowers and the grass and everything. And and we sat there eating our lunch. Brother and I just sitting there and down there a bunch of mountain sheep, stone mountain sheep. So he just started counting 38 and they were having their lunch while we had our lunch. I thought this is like heaven, brother Nathan. &gt;&gt; It's like heaven. &gt;&gt; And and Brother Graham, he just looked up. There's just a vast valley up this way and this thousands of acres of grass and way down below maybe river or streams look like human hair. and he looked down the valley this way and up this way and say, "You know, brother Eddie, on the other side, &gt;&gt; it's just very much like this. [Music] Why wouldn't we want to go there? That's where we're going." &gt;&gt; Yeah. He said, "When you get over there, you'll find little trails." &gt;&gt; He said, "You walk down one of those one day and you'll find me." &gt;&gt; Amen. Whatever happens in this life, that's the one thing I'm counting on. I'm I'm looking for a trail. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Is it just something, you know, a picture in our mind? No. No. A reality. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It's beyond that. It's true and it's real. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Glory. Well, I'd like to just think, too, there's been a change in me since Jesus set me free. So, we're declaring already there's been a change. And perhaps, Brother Nathan, I could have you come up and just close in prayer. Brother Ernie will be speaking tonight. Come early, please. Cuz it's a going to be a great service. in a change in me since Jesus set me free. I [Music] &gt;&gt; that's the past. I'm born again. That's the present. Turn around. My feet are on solid ground. Someday I'll wear my crown. Oh, what a change. Do you believe it for yourself? There's been a change in me. Jesus set me free. I calary and born again. [Music] I cannot turn around. My feet are on ground. Someday I'll wear a crown. Oh, &gt;&gt; why don't you turn around and shake hands with a few people? Hands you're going to shake on the other side. Isn't that all right? [Music] See you on the other side, brother sister. Come, brother Nathan. There's been a change [Music] since Jesus said I [Music] cannot turn around. Oh no, my feet are on ground. [Applause] I'll wear a crown. Oh, what a change. And let everyone say, I believe it. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; God bless you, brother Nathan. [Music] Oh Lord Jesus, &gt;&gt; what a promise.

We love you and adore you, Father. Oh, thank you, Lord Jesus. Thank you, Jesus. In your name we pray, oh God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. Thank you, brother Nathan. And God bless you. We're just missing you all. And we would like you not only remember the service tonight, our brother Ernie is going to be speaking to us on Wednesday evening and Friday evening. Uh was there young people's this coming Friday or no? Cuz we wanted to have the uh like to we're having the prayer service. We started just last Friday. Uh, and I wanted to come. I generally I'm studying on Friday night or visiting has been so hard. But we just decided I said to my wife, I want to be to the prayer service. So, we went there and it was lovely, lovely presence and a nice group of people, probably 50 people or so were there and young people and families were there. So, I just want to encourage you on Friday night, we'll be in the fellowship room and and uh in another week or two, we're going to be just adjusting the order of it a wee bit because there's certain certain ones which I have been very very blessed with their testimony and so maybe after prayer we might just hear somebody give their testimony and that way we get better acquainted with one another. And I tell you, there's some rich testimonies here. So, God bless you and all of you, brother Oed and uh Brother Israel or those that have come from Seattle. Uh I I hope that you have a place to eat and something to eat and a place to put your feet up and that you'll be looked after. Amen. We appreciate you coming this long ways. God bless you. You're dismissed in Jesus name. &gt;&gt; Amen. [Music] [Music] Hallelujah. [Music] Heat. Heat. [Music] [Music] Hallelujah. [Music] God. [Music] Glory to the Lord. [Music]
