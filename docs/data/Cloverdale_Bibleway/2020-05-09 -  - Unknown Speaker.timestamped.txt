[1:20] coming home the other night or the other
[1:22] day or just for come home
[1:24] I was fell into a vision and I seen some
[1:29] little fellas theme look like young boys
[1:31] or something head on cat and we were
[1:34] standing hunting and I'd shot a mammoth
[1:37] big brown looking bear and then they
[1:40] turned around and said to me said but
[1:43] there's some confusion about the meeting
[1:45] I said no matter what the confusion is
[1:47] if I suppose go wherever it was
[1:49] I'll go anyhow see it doesn't matter in
[1:51] the vision stop I don't know where
[1:54] that's at but this is on Katie it's
[1:56] going to happen
[1:56] just remember it's going to happen
[1:58] Division on one of the trips we had just
[2:03] arrived and made camp and brother
[2:10] brothers Southwick said Blaine why don't
[2:13] you and Billy Paul and brother Ed go
[2:18] this direction and I and brother branham
[2:21] will will will go up the mountain just
[2:24] behind us here and I think that he
[2:27] wanted to do that because on the first
[2:29] day of the hunt he wanted to build take
[2:34] brother Brent a little bit easier and he
[2:36] wanted a little easier for himself as
[2:38] well because he had you know suffered a
[2:41] wee bit with that in China so they were
[2:44] going to take it easier and we made our
[2:46] way down the valley and then up into
[2:52] another little valley and we just
[2:55] climbed up on a bench and there was a
[2:57] giant bear coming down the other side of
[3:02] this valley not far from us and he was
[3:05] making his way and we kind of positioned
[3:08] ourselves behind some willows I never
[3:11] saw a bear like this before or since and
[3:15] he was quite dark very large and right
[3:21] from behind his ears and Overhill over
[3:24] his hump and on his down his cape down
[3:29] his breast like so he was just the color
[3:32] of
[3:33] golden wheat I never saw a bear like
[3:36] that it was the most magnificent thing
[3:38] and large and he was turning over stones
[3:41] and looking for ants and things that
[3:45] maybe rodents and so on and he's making
[3:48] his way down and I know that Grizzlies
[3:51] are very poor sighted but they're
[3:56] hearing and and especially their smell
[3:59] is so accurate we don't know that world
[4:04] at all but God has given them that and
[4:07] he when he walked out to there where the
[4:12] hills turned into this valley and he
[4:16] just across from us and Billy Paul and
[4:20] brother Blaine and myself we got down in
[4:23] the Willows there was just small willows
[4:26] there and we were watching this bear and
[4:28] he came down and he was across from us
[4:31] he was probably four or five six hundred
[4:34] yards across the mouth of this little
[4:37] Valley it was I started like a wash from
[4:41] a basin and we were watching him and the
[4:48] other brothers thought I should try a
[4:50] shot at it and I said no I wouldn't do
[4:53] that I said brother branham hasn't fired
[4:55] a shot yet that I know of I said I
[4:58] wouldn't want to do that we didn't know
[5:02] had not connected it with the a vision
[5:06] brother branham had had on a large big
[5:10] brown bear and this was him and we
[5:14] watched him for probably half an hour
[5:16] and then I saw that bear and he just put
[5:20] that giant head up into the air in the
[5:24] wind and he he was a tossed his head
[5:28] back and forth and he was trying to get
[5:31] our scent and then he just went like
[5:35] this and looked straight across the
[5:37] valley at us and then he wheeled around
[5:41] and started on a gallop and
[5:45] and straight up this mountain I timed
[5:47] him it was probably 1012 minutes and it
[5:51] went right right over the top of this
[5:53] mountain up into the glacier and his big
[5:57] paws and we were watching in the glasses
[5:59] and he ran right over the top of this
[6:02] mountain and disappeared that day
[6:08] brother Billy Paul had gotten a caribou
[6:11] and I also got a caribou later in the
[6:15] afternoon and the next day was just
[6:20] cloudy stormy weather and a rained and
[6:24] it was cold and that night and the next
[6:28] day and the next day and the next day
[6:31] four days we were locked into the tent
[6:36] and I heard brother South wake he kinda
[6:41] came by because I was kind of the point
[6:44] man and arranged the hunts and what the
[6:49] food and not things you know organized
[6:51] for the hunt and so he kind of it just
[6:57] came by me said I think brother branham
[6:59] wants to go home
[7:01] all I said you know that was a shock to
[7:05] me I couldn't believe that he wanted to
[7:07] go home we hadn't really started the
[7:10] hunt in earnest
[7:11] so I said to brother Brennan why I said
[7:14] but the Branum do you do you want to go
[7:16] home all he said we've had a wonderful
[7:19] hunt I said but you haven't even fired a
[7:23] shot he said well that means I can come
[7:26] back next year and he took it so nicely
[7:29] and and I felt I felt kind of
[7:34] downhearted that to me it hadn't been
[7:37] completed and it was raining and cloudy
[7:43] and clouds were hanging low and it was
[7:47] cold it was just very miserable weather
[7:50] so bud started to pack up things and
[7:54] make ready to go and it was I was
[7:58] feeling quite down cast and we had the
[8:01] horses outside and now I'm starting to
[8:04] put the panniers on them and this is
[8:07] quite a lengthy process probably take
[8:11] two and a half three hours and I was
[8:15] outside with my horse and brother
[8:17] Brennan he came up and he said brother
[8:21] anywhere was it that you saw that bear
[8:23] and I said well I pointed down the
[8:27] valley I said it's right down here and
[8:30] where those that little valley comes in
[8:34] to this one I said oh you just turn left
[8:38] and he'd go right up in there and he was
[8:40] right on that bench of the mountain and
[8:45] he said how long are we going to be so
[8:49] we asked bud how long are we going to be
[8:52] all he said you have lots of time you
[8:55] just take your time and Odin and you
[8:58] know you've got a lot of time probably a
[9:00] couple of hours yet so brother branham
[9:03] just disappeared and no those short
[9:05] willows and he was gone and and brother
[9:09] bud carried on and I was standing with
[9:13] my horse and we were in our rain here
[9:16] and this was really remarkable and then
[9:21] finally I got all on my horse and I was
[9:24] sitting on my horse and brother branham
[9:27] about an hour and a half or two hours
[9:29] later he came out he he'd been out he'd
[9:34] actually been alone with God I believe
[9:37] and he came out and he came up right
[9:41] beside my horse and this is what
[9:45] happened to me this is what I heard and
[9:49] this is my testimony
[9:52] and he said put his finger up he said
[9:57] this was on account of me he he said and
[10:02] some people might be offended with this
[10:04] but this is what he said I'm the Jonah
[10:07] in this group he said I knew I should
[10:10] have been with you little fellows he
[10:13] said that's the only time I know that
[10:15] I've disobeyed a vision only twice only
[10:19] twice they're like no one I've disobeyed
[10:21] a vision and he said like this was the
[10:25] second time and he said but he said that
[10:31] this is over and will ride out of here
[10:35] dry dry the leaves on the bushes were
[10:40] just labeled with rain and wet and if
[10:45] you just went a few meters few yards
[10:49] into the woods because there were short
[10:53] willows but if you would just go a few
[10:56] yards you'd be soaking wet and I was
[10:59] just I was bewildered I didn't know what
[11:01] to say I didn't know how to respond and
[11:04] I just sat there and I was sitting there
[11:08] about maybe 10 minutes and pondering the
[11:13] words that I've just heard but we'll
[11:17] drive we'll ride out of here dry it's
[11:21] over he said it's over and we'll ride
[11:25] out of here dry so all I knew is that
[11:30] whatever disappointment there was or
[11:35] he'd settle something with God or
[11:37] whatever I wasn't questioning I didn't
[11:41] try to figure things out
[11:43] I just knew it was over and in about ten
[11:48] minutes
[11:49] not more than 10 12 15 minutes at the
[11:53] most
[11:54] there was a puff of air warm air that
[12:00] just kind of blew by by me and I thought
[12:04] why that was not
[12:06] that was nice warm air and I we hadn't
[12:10] felt that for a number of days and just
[12:14] a little puff of hair and then a little
[12:19] while later there's a little breeze and
[12:22] the leaves were shaking and I noticed uh
[12:27] probably 20 30 yards or meters in front
[12:31] of me a sudden the Sun was shining just
[12:36] a big round spot where the Sun was
[12:38] shining that probably I looked up there
[12:42] was a hole in the sky and I was looking
[12:45] at blue sky and the Sun was shining
[12:48] straight through there on the ground and
[12:51] a little warm breeze was just like a
[12:54] Hawaiian breeze was blowing just dog
[12:59] lovely little breeze and the leaves were
[13:02] shaking and before our horses took the
[13:07] first step it was hot sunshine I took
[13:12] off rain gear that I had on and we rode
[13:16] out of there in our shirt sleeves and it
[13:19] was very warm weather and we rode all
[13:22] the way home about eight hours in
[13:26] perfect sunshine and just a lovely day
[13:31] you couldn't have had a more
[13:32] picture-perfect day than that day and we
[13:36] just rolled out dry I want to say to the
[13:39] viewers if we'd wrote out wet you
[13:43] wouldn't be hearing this testimony we
[13:46] wrote out dry that's what he said and
[13:49] that's exactly what happened and I want
[13:53] to give all the glory to our Lord Jesus
[13:56] Christ the people and many people don't
[14:01] understand some don't think well it's
[14:04] not fulfilled etc I would like to I have
[14:07] a couple of slides here that we'd like
[14:10] to refer to and I'd like to quote
[14:18] this is in September 1962 after the hunt
[14:23] and it's in the message countdown
[14:26] brother Branham says so I in these
[14:29] thirty going on thirty two years of
[14:32] ministry I have tried to stay just read
[14:39] it out of the Bible is that just what
[14:41] the Bible says and let it go like that
[14:43] and so I haven't had to take back or
[14:45] rearrange because I just said it the way
[14:48] that the Bible says it and I find out if
[14:52] God has spoken anything then we must go
[14:57] with that word in order to make it be
[15:00] fulfilled we've seen that as I told you
[15:03] last I have a vision just recently that
[15:06] if I had to be there and warning to be
[15:09] there and telling me six months before
[15:11] to be on that spot and standing there
[15:14] saying go down there three times with
[15:16] them I just walked on with the other man
[15:18] and the vision passed right through
[15:20] exactly God's part I was there standing
[15:22] so we want to remember you've got to
[15:25] stay on the word stay right with the
[15:27] word where the word lead you go right
[15:29] with the word and you bring out all
[15:32] right I'm sure and that that for my part
[15:38] is the absolute solution and to the
[15:42] vision I I'm just sorry that a lot of
[15:49] people either don't ask their pastors or
[15:53] they don't research it in the message
[15:56] and then some just speak presumptuously
[15:59] that's without authority of any kind
[16:02] they don't have any super national
[16:04] authority they don't have the attendance
[16:06] of the angel of the Lord and they go
[16:09] ahead and say that brother Branham spoke
[16:12] presumptuously well I can I can declare
[16:16] he did not he spoke with great authority
[16:19] and great clarity and furthermore I was
[16:23] right there
[16:24] it never belittled her to me
[16:26] him when he said this is on account of
[16:28] me never occurred to me that that it
[16:32] made less of him I always thought it was
[16:34] great it was greater that he could
[16:38] actually say it this is on account of me
[16:41] I mean that I didn't want to be selfish
[16:45] but the fact that we wrote of dry and
[16:48] the weather changed I said what kind of
[16:52] man is this you know that speaks of the
[16:55] wind and the waves and speaks to the
[16:57] storm and the clouds and what is this
[17:01] what's God doing for me you know I
[17:03] always thought that it was just beyond
[17:08] beyond what was almost necessary you
[17:13] know that we that we that I I would be
[17:18] privileged to experience that and hear
[17:21] it and baffled me that people would find
[17:24] that as a reason to disbelieve I thought
[17:27] what in the world is going through their
[17:31] minds I just I can't even understand
[17:35] that today I just can't understand it he
[17:38] just lived lived it lived a full life of
[17:42] the Lord Jesus Christ whether it was
[17:47] whether it was in honor or whether he
[17:50] was admitting that he wasn't standing
[17:53] where he should be as he said in the
[17:55] message and he told it right publicly to
[17:58] the people and you have to be standing
[18:01] were you standing with the word if it's
[18:04] to be fulfilled and then it'll be all
[18:06] right
[18:08] [Music]
[18:17] you
