[0:00] [Music]
[0:55] with love.
[0:57] As I walk with a heavenly love,
[1:02] let me go all the while with a song and
[1:07] a smile. Fill my way every day with
[1:11] love.
[1:14] Amen.
[1:16] Every day with his love. Could you need
[1:19] anything else?
[1:22] No, not a whole lot. Not a whole lot. We
[1:25] bring you greetings in the name of our
[1:26] Lord Jesus Christ. It's very good to see
[1:29] each and every one of you. The more
[1:30] comfortable I get, I can actually try to
[1:32] look in your faces as I look around. So,
[1:35] it's a little bit different for me. I
[1:36] told Brother DDA one uh one evening on
[1:39] the way down to Seattle. I said, "Well,
[1:41] the trick is you just close your eyes.
[1:43] They disappear.
[1:45] Go right away." He said, "I might have
[1:47] to try that sometime." So, I don't know
[1:49] if he's done it or not, but it's uh one
[1:52] of those things where you have to just
[1:54] be comfortable with yourself, not worry
[1:56] about who's around you, not worry about
[1:58] who's looking back at you. Just sing
[2:00] unto the Lord.
[2:02] &gt;&gt; Amen. I want that kind of blessing.
[2:06] &gt;&gt; Amen. That Jacob got.
[2:11] Can we start with a chorus?
[2:18] I want I want that kind of blessing that
[2:24] safe and deep and sad my soul. I want I
[2:31] want that full salvation till pillows of
[2:36] heaven or me roll. Oh, I want I want
[2:43] that kind of blessing that saves and
[2:47] keeps and satisfies my soul. I want I
[2:52] want that full salvation till
[2:58] of heaven or roll.
[3:02] When Jacob met the Lord upon that lonely
[3:06] night and wrestled there alone until the
[3:11] morning light
[3:13] on a princely title to g him for the
[3:17] ride. I know I want that kind of
[3:21] blessing.
[3:23] Oh, I want I want that kind of blessing
[3:29] that saves and keeps and satisfies my
[3:34] soul. I want I want that full salvation
[3:42] of heaven or evil. We'll sing it for us
[3:45] again. I want I want that kind of
[3:50] blessing that saves and keeps and
[3:55] satisfies my soul. I want I want that
[4:00] kind of salvation till below of heaven
[4:05] or below.
[4:08] You saved my soul when I was lost.
[4:12] You've surely been good to me. You saved
[4:15] my soul when I was lost. You've surely
[4:18] been good to me. You saved my soul when
[4:23] I was lost. You've surely been good to
[4:26] me. You have done what this world could
[4:30] not do.
[4:32] Oh Lord, Lord, Lord, you surely been
[4:37] good to me. Oh Lord, Lord, Lord, you've
[4:42] surely been good to me.
[4:45] Lord, Lord, Lord, you surely been good
[4:49] to me. You have done what this world
[4:53] could not do.
[4:56] Oh, you filled me with the Holy Ghost.
[4:59] You surely been good to me. Has he
[5:02] filled you?
[5:02] &gt;&gt; You filled me with
[5:04] &gt;&gt; the Holy Ghost. You've surely been good
[5:07] to me. me. You filled me with the Holy
[5:10] Ghost. You've surely been good to me.
[5:14] You have done what this world could not
[5:17] do. And singing, Lord, Lord, Lord,
[5:23] you've surely been. Oh Lord, Lord, Lord,
[5:28] you surely been good to me.
[5:32] Lord, Lord, Lord, you've surely been
[5:35] good to me. You have done what this
[5:39] world could not do. If he's healed you,
[5:42] oh, you healed my body when I was sick.
[5:46] You surely been good to me. You touched
[5:48] me, Lord.
[5:50] &gt;&gt; When I was sick, you surely been good to
[5:53] me. You healed my body. When I was sick,
[5:57] you surely been good to me. You have
[6:01] done what this world could not do. Oh
[6:06] Lord, Lord, Lord, I know you surely been
[6:11] to me. Oh Lord, Lord, Lord, you surely
[6:16] been good to me.
[6:18] Lord, Lord, Lord, you surely been good
[6:22] to me. You have done what this world
[6:26] could not do.
[6:29] [Music]
[6:31] Amen. 2565
[6:35] I have a maker.
[6:37] He's formed my heart. Has he given you a
[6:39] new heart?
[6:40] &gt;&gt; Taken out the old stony heart. That
[6:43] heart that couldn't even make a good
[6:46] decision. Couldn't even go down the
[6:48] right road. He had to come and take out
[6:51] your heart. Give you a heart of flesh.
[6:54] One that you could actually say, "Aba,
[6:56] father
[6:58] on your own." It's a hard hard road.
[7:02] But if you turn your life over to his
[7:03] hands and you can sing this song with a
[7:06] true conviction, it'll mean something.
[7:10] I have a maker
[7:16] before
[7:18] my heart
[7:23] and before even time began.
[7:28] My life was in his hands.
[7:36] He knows my name.
[7:43] He knows my every
[7:46] thought.
[7:49] He sees each tear that falls.
[7:55] And he hears me when I call.
[8:02] I have
[8:04] a father.
[8:09] He calls me his own.
[8:15] And he'll never leave
[8:19] me.
[8:21] No matter where I go,
[8:28] he knows my name.
[8:35] He knows my every
[8:38] thought.
[8:41] He sees each
[8:45] that fall
[8:46] and he hears me when I call.
[8:54] He knows my name. Does he know your name
[8:58] tonight?
[9:01] He knows my every thought.
[9:07] He sees each
[9:10] that
[9:12] and he hears me when I call.
[9:20] He knows my name. Do you got to you got
[9:25] to recognize his voice, saints? He knows
[9:28] my every
[9:30] thought.
[9:33] He sees each tear that falls
[9:39] and he hears me when I call.
[9:46] Hallelujah.
[9:48] Hallelujah. Lord, where would we be,
[9:51] Father, if we had not heard that voice?
[9:55] That voice that could call out our name,
[9:59] could give us a new heart.
[10:03] How we love you tonight, Father.
[10:07] Hallelujah.
[10:10] Hallelujah.
[10:12] [Music]
[10:17] Quiet me. Key of F.
[10:25] Quiet
[10:27] me.
[10:29] Let peaceful waters flow.
[10:34] Learn to be still
[10:38] my soul.
[10:40] [Music]
[10:45] &gt;&gt; Oh Jesus walking near.
[10:50] Touch me, Lord, and quiet
[10:54] me.
[10:58] Quiet
[11:00] me.
[11:01] Let peaceful waters flow.
[11:05] Oh, learn to be still, my soul.
[11:10] [Music]
[11:13] Let me hear
[11:16] Jesus walking.
[11:19] Oh, touch me, Lord, and quiet
[11:24] me. Let's all stand and sing it. Oh,
[11:27] quiet
[11:29] me.
[11:31] Let peaceful waters flow.
[11:35] Learn to be still my soul.
[11:42] Let me hear.
[11:46] Jesus walking near.
[11:49] Touch me Lord and quiet
[11:53] me. Quiet me Lord.
[11:57] Quiet
[11:58] me.
[12:00] That peaceful waters flow.
[12:04] Learn to be still my soul.
[12:11] Let me heal.
[12:15] Jesus walking. Oh, touch me Lord and
[12:20] quiet.
[12:22] Oh, if we can just close our eyes and
[12:24] sing it now. Quiet
[12:27] me.
[12:29] Let peaceful waterers flow.
[12:33] Learn to be still
[12:36] my soul.
[12:41] &gt;&gt; I want to hear him tonight.
[12:44] walking amongst his people once again.
[12:47] Touch me Lord and quiet
[12:51] me.
[12:55] Hallelujah.
[12:58] Hallelujah. Father,
[13:01] quiet our spirits, Lord.
[13:05] Lord, let a
[13:08] peace fall upon the people this evening,
[13:10] Lord.
[13:12] Lord, such a quietness, Father, that we
[13:14] could hear you, Lord, moving in amongst
[13:17] us, Lord, working that which we don't
[13:19] even expect.
[13:22] Dealing with lives, Lord, opening
[13:25] hearts, Father,
[13:27] changing us from glory unto glory
[13:30] &gt;&gt; in that realm which cannot be seen.
[13:33] &gt;&gt; But Lord, we want to manifest fruits
[13:35] from that realm. Lord Jesus,
[13:40] help us tonight. We pray. Father,
[13:44] &gt;&gt; Brother Mike Gier, I'm going to ask you
[13:45] to come,
[13:49] take us to the Lord in prayer this
[13:51] evening.
[13:53] Amen. Who has a need upon your heart
[13:56] that in faith you've looked in the word,
[13:59] you've studied it, you said, "Lord, I
[14:01] know this particular verse is my
[14:05] situation. This particular chapter is
[14:08] right where I'm living and you desire
[14:10] that the Lord would come by your way
[14:12] tonight.
[14:14] That's faith. When you can match up the
[14:16] desire in your heart with the word, he's
[14:19] duty bound to act on it.
[14:22] Your needs are the prayer requests we're
[14:24] going to take tonight. What you each
[14:26] have upon your heart, I don't know.
[14:28] Brother Mike doesn't know. But the one
[14:30] that can do something about it knows.
[14:33] Right where you're living tonight.
[14:35] Brother Mike, would you come?
[14:39] I'm going to ask Brother Mike if you'd
[14:42] help sing 2548. I die believing.
[14:46] [Music]
[14:49] That's the commitment
[14:51] that you have to make.
[14:54] Jesus went to the cross
[14:56] and he died believing.
[14:59] The word was written of him. If you can
[15:02] have that testimony tonight, we'll sing
[15:05] it together. Brother Mike,
[15:22] &gt;&gt; I die
[15:27] a to make. Oh yes, Lord.
[15:31] I die believing
[15:36] if that's what it takes.
[15:39] [Music]
[15:43] I die believing
[15:47] the catching away of your bride.
[15:51] I die believing
[15:56] you're living inside.
[16:02] I die.
[16:06] Difference a token makes.
[16:10] I die believing.
[16:15] If that's what it takes.
[16:21] I die believing
[16:25] the catching away of your bride.
[16:29] I died believing
[16:33] you're living inside.
[16:38] My precious Lord Jesus. Lord truly
[16:42] we are believers oh God
[16:45] &gt;&gt; and our whole desire is Lord to have
[16:48] that rapturing faith to get out of here
[16:50] Lord God. We believe your promises for
[16:53] us in this day Lord. We've been called
[16:55] in this hour, Lord. As your prophet
[16:57] said, this bed in time, Lord God, we've
[16:59] been placed here for a reason, Lord God.
[17:02] Lord, you didn't call us to leave us
[17:04] behind and you didn't call us, Lord God,
[17:06] that we would sit on our hands as it
[17:08] were, Lord God. But you've called us,
[17:10] Lord, to be a people up and about your
[17:12] word, Lord God, doing those things,
[17:14] Lord, that you desire in our lives, Lord
[17:16] God. And father, this night, Lord, we
[17:19] gather, Lord, once again around your
[17:22] word, Lord Jesus, we're longing to be
[17:25] fed, Lord, to come up higher in Jesus
[17:28] Christ, oh God. To take our full and
[17:30] rightful position beside you, Lord God,
[17:32] to be the people you've called us to be,
[17:35] Lord. to be Lord the word in flesh this
[17:38] day Lord God as your prophet said the
[17:40] three-fold manifestation the three-fold
[17:43] purpose of God in this day Lord God was
[17:45] to be in a people to Lord just to bring
[17:48] them to that rapturing condition Lord
[17:50] that they could be the bride on display
[17:53] Lord God that we could usher in that
[17:55] millennium oh God and Father Lord
[17:58] tonight we look to you for these needs
[18:00] amongst your family Lord God in this
[18:03] congregation Lord and we just ask you to
[18:06] go to each and every heart. Lord God,
[18:09] Father, you know what's behind each hand
[18:11] that is lifted. Lord, there are
[18:14] sicknesses, Lord. There are troubles,
[18:16] Lord. There are finances, Lord. Lord,
[18:19] there are family members that are
[18:20] weward, Lord. And Lord, I just think of
[18:23] our brother John Annie and how I believe
[18:26] it was a prophecy. He said, "At this
[18:28] camp, you'll see your children coming
[18:29] in, Lord." He he had declared Lord from
[18:32] your word Lord by the evidence Lord that
[18:34] is stacking up all around us Lord that
[18:37] this is the season that we we are in the
[18:39] rapturing faith in the rapturing
[18:41] condition and we're expecting Lord God
[18:44] Lord we are that quick short work oh God
[18:47] and Lord we're just coming into our
[18:49] place Lord Jesus that all these things
[18:52] that are ours God and just claim them
[18:54] all Lord and Father we just ask you to
[18:57] remember the Bergen family Lord Broaden
[18:59] Cindy
[19:00] Lord, brother Rod's dad passing. Father,
[19:04] he had this testimony, Lord, that he
[19:05] pleased you, Lord God. And Lord, he just
[19:08] took one more step and he's on the other
[19:10] side. But, Father, it's for us that are
[19:12] left behind, Lord, that we grieve. We
[19:15] grieve not for our for our loved one
[19:17] that's passed on, but for ourselves,
[19:19] Lord, as I heard your prophet say today
[19:22] on tape, Lord, we we just want to hold
[19:24] on. We just want to hold on to those
[19:26] people, Lord. We don't want to let them
[19:27] go. We don't want to.
[19:30] But Father God, we just pray that you'd
[19:33] comfort the hearts and oh, just
[19:36] encourage and strengthen them, Lord.
[19:38] Bless them to be a continuing testimony,
[19:40] Lord, for your glory. And as we turn to
[19:43] the word, Lord, just feed our souls.
[19:45] Draw us closer and commit ourselves to
[19:48] you in Jesus precious name. Amen.
[19:53] &gt;&gt; Amen. God bless you as you have your
[19:55] seats. Jeremy Waldner has a special for
[19:58] us tonight before we turn the service
[20:01] over to our pastor, Brother Biscll.
[20:04] We've got uh one announcement as Jeremy
[20:07] comes.
[20:09] The volunteers that were needed for the
[20:12] tent set up at the camp over in Birch
[20:14] Bay on Saturday has been uh shifted a
[20:18] little bit to 2:00. and all of those
[20:20] volunteers that have come forward and
[20:23] talked to our brother Tom Frey. Um, we
[20:25] appreciate all of your support and I
[20:28] believe that brother Tom has enough. But
[20:30] if you're looking for something to do at
[20:31] 4:00 and you don't want to just stand
[20:33] around and fellowship the help away, I'm
[20:36] sure they'd appreciate you coming out
[20:37] giving them a hand. God bless you.
[20:52] So many times our friends will tell us,
[20:56] "I won't let you down."
[20:59] But when the storms are threatening
[21:02] danger, they cannot be found.
[21:06] But there's a friend whose name is
[21:09] Jesus, and his promise is real. There is
[21:13] no doubt he'll bring me out when he says
[21:17] I will. I will fight all of your
[21:22] battles. Give them all to me. I can make
[21:27] all of your trials end in victory.
[21:32] I have all power and glory. It is mine
[21:37] to give. Oh, what a blessing. I am
[21:41] resting for he said I will. The devil
[21:46] tries to make me stumble, make me so
[21:50] afraid, but I'll wrestle him all through
[21:54] the night till the breaking of the day.
[21:58] They're holding fast to God's dear
[22:00] promise. Glory is revealed.
[22:04] He stands there waiting, gently saying,
[22:07] "Child, you know I will. I will fight
[22:12] all of your battles. Give them all to
[22:15] me. I can make all of your trials end in
[22:21] victory.
[22:23] I have all power and glory. It is mine
[22:28] to give. Oh, what a blessing I am
[22:32] resting for. He said, "I will. I will
[22:38] fight all of your battles. Give them all
[22:41] to me.
[22:43] I can make all of your trials end in
[22:47] victory.
[22:49] I have all power and glory. It is mine
[22:54] to give. Oh, what a blessing. I am
[22:59] resting for he said I will. Oh what a
[23:04] blessing I am resting for. He said I
[23:08] will.
[23:11] [Applause]
[23:18] &gt;&gt; When he said I will
[23:20] &gt;&gt; you didn't have to say and I will.
[23:24] &gt;&gt; It's a paradox isn't it? In simplicity,
[23:28] God reveals himself.
[23:31] He says, "I'll take this upon me. I will
[23:34] give you rest."
[23:36] &gt;&gt; As our pastor comes, we'll sing 20001 on
[23:40] the screen.
[23:42] At the campground, 2:00. Don't know if
[23:45] anybody got confused on that. It was
[23:47] originally at 4. We want you out there
[23:49] at 2:00 to help set up the tent. And
[23:52] those in the choir, make sure that
[23:53] you're here at 700 PM Friday evening for
[23:56] a practice.
[23:59] We'll start with the chorus.
[24:04] We will
[24:07] of God
[24:10] still hold
[24:13] me closer
[24:15] till I
[24:18] am holding
[24:23] in
[24:29] God
[24:33] be closer
[24:35] till I
[24:38] am
[24:41] lost
[24:43] in thee
[24:46] will
[24:48] of God
[24:50] still hold
[24:52] me closer
[24:55] till I
[24:58] and all
[25:00] lost
[25:02] in the
[25:04] sweet
[25:07] of God.
[25:09] Till
[25:12] me closer,
[25:14] till I
[25:17] am holdy
[25:20] lost.
[25:22] Take thee one more time. Sweet will
[25:27] of God
[25:29] still hold
[25:32] me closer
[25:34] when I
[25:37] am
[25:40] lost
[25:42] in the
[25:44] sweet
[25:45] [Music]
[25:52] me closer
[25:54] Till I
[25:56] am holy
[25:59] lost
[26:01] in thee.
[26:05] &gt;&gt; If we ever get lost, that's the place we
[26:07] want to be.
[26:09] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[26:11] &gt;&gt; Well, we have uh just before we turn to
[26:13] the word, we have a couple of
[26:15] announcements we'd like to make. And I
[26:18] don't know, did they say anything but
[26:19] brother Rod's dad? They prayed for him
[26:23] as you had prayer. I I didn't hear
[26:26] everything in the study. Brother Rod
[26:28] Bergen's father passed away early this
[26:31] morning a little bit after midnight.
[26:35] And uh passed into the presence of God.
[26:40] uh as you know, of course, he's not just
[26:42] Rod's father, but he's a granddad to a
[26:46] lot of the uh couples and families that
[26:50] are here in the church and uh all the
[26:53] Bergen children and Jeremy and Jake and
[26:57] Anna
[27:00] uh and Jonathan.
[27:03] So, we want to remember them and their
[27:04] spouses.
[27:06] Uh, Brother Berg and I've known him for
[27:09] a lot of years. Just a lot of years. And
[27:12] one thing I I just sent Rod a little
[27:17] email this morning. I always found him
[27:20] to have a just a not only a twinkle, but
[27:24] his eyes flashed when you'd speak about
[27:27] anything that you know would touch his
[27:30] heart spiritually.
[27:32] And um the congregation many of you
[27:35] perhaps most of you don't know but Rod's
[27:39] parents went to Ern Baxter's church and
[27:44] Ern Baxter was one of brother Brandham's
[27:46] first managers
[27:48] and do you hear brother Brandham talk
[27:49] about him all the time and he was a
[27:52] Vancouver pastor and Rod and his Rod's
[27:56] parents went to that church and that
[27:58] that was their pastor for many many many
[28:00] years. So uh they've been uh acquainted
[28:04] with the early ministry of course
[28:08] and uh so we'll remember that the family
[28:11] each of them and remember especially
[28:12] Rod's mother
[28:15] uh she has lost a daughter
[28:19] a granddaughter
[28:22] and a husband
[28:24] in just the last little while very short
[28:27] time that's a heavy heavy loss and I
[28:31] have a granddaughter in an accident and
[28:33] a daughter by cancer and now her
[28:36] husband. And regardless of how ready a
[28:39] person might think they are, you're
[28:41] never really fully ready, you know, for
[28:43] that moment of such separation. So, we'd
[28:46] like to remember Rod's mother and uh
[28:51] pray that even in this in this time of
[28:54] crisis, and that's what I've always
[28:55] believed, in a time of crisis is a great
[28:59] opportunity for God to make himself
[29:01] known to a person. And that's what we
[29:03] want to pray. And no one knows him as
[29:06] well as we should.
[29:09] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[29:10] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[29:11] Now, we're coming up to the camp time
[29:15] and uh people are gearing up that are in
[29:18] the different departments and areas of
[29:20] help. And I just so appreciate it. I
[29:23] mean, let me say from my heart that a
[29:25] camp of this magnitude just plain
[29:28] wouldn't happen if we didn't have
[29:31] willing people that just get in there
[29:33] and and I find the whole congregation is
[29:35] is willing and whatever area you're able
[29:38] to just lend a hand or be called on. Uh
[29:43] there are so many that are taking
[29:45] responsibility and how how appreciative
[29:48] I am and how indebted we are as a
[29:51] congregation to have uh have a a people
[29:55] like this that are not only uh you're
[29:58] giving people of your own hospitality
[30:01] and that's what we have to ask for right
[30:04] now. We're getting calls from the from
[30:07] the saints in the Seattle Tacoma area
[30:09] and there's quite a number of them would
[30:11] like to come up and take in the meetings
[30:14] but they're not able of course to have
[30:18] uh to get motel and all all of that.
[30:21] They can't afford that. So we do need
[30:24] accommodation but the accommodation I
[30:26] think uh brother diddy you were saying
[30:28] needs to be on the US side. Is there any
[30:32] &gt;&gt; preferably preferably because then we
[30:34] won't have the border to contend with
[30:36] during the meetings. So
[30:40] now for all of you that are living on
[30:42] the US side, if you can accommodate
[30:46] one or two or a family or whatever more,
[30:49] if you would please uh contact the
[30:52] office, call the office and speak with
[30:54] Sister Bonnie. If she's not there, speak
[30:56] with brother Dier. And if you, you know,
[30:59] if you can roll out a sleeping bag or
[31:01] something, uh, or we can pretend we're
[31:05] an Indian, just roll out a little grass
[31:07] mat, whatever. But if you can
[31:09] accommodate anyone and give them nice
[31:12] hospitality for these few days of
[31:14] meetings or maybe just the weekend, uh,
[31:16] just let uh, Sister Bonnie or brother
[31:20] Dier know.
[31:23] All right,
[31:26] that's good. And remember in your in
[31:28] your giving when you're giving your
[31:30] tithes and offerings now like you to
[31:33] remember that the we the camp is a very
[31:37] heavy cost and we uh we've never really
[31:41] said anything. We don't make any appeals
[31:43] about it. We think that you're uh you
[31:46] know you're adult. you know how things
[31:49] are and you know what things cost and uh
[31:52] you know in time you rent chairs and and
[31:55] the grounds and so on and then there are
[31:57] a lot of children that come. We like to
[32:00] make certain that all the children can
[32:02] come. We don't want anybody of this
[32:04] congregation at least
[32:07] uh to not be able to come because of
[32:11] cost. We say bring them anyhow. Doesn't
[32:14] the congregation you agree with that?
[32:16] bring them anyhow. And we want them in
[32:19] that atmosphere. And the young people,
[32:21] we want them in that atmosphere. And
[32:23] we're going to make sure that
[32:24] everything's covered. God has always
[32:26] blessed it. Amen. Every time. Has always
[32:30] blessed it. Do you remember the time
[32:33] that the Baptist campground undercharged
[32:36] us by $11,000?
[32:41] How many know about that? How many don't
[32:44] know about it? Oh, there's a whole lot
[32:46] more don't know about it. Well, the
[32:49] undercharged it was all settled because
[32:51] we're we're one group and we're probably
[32:54] the only group is from what I finally
[32:56] heard that the night the meeting is
[32:59] over. We write a check and we're all
[33:02] done. We're out of here. We're history.
[33:04] Goodbye. And so, Brother Tom wrote the
[33:07] check and uh what was his name? Bill,
[33:10] wasn't it? Yeah, brother Bill. Bill, I
[33:12] call him brother.
[33:15] And uh so we we we were on their case a
[33:18] lot of times. We were on their case over
[33:20] the food and we were on their case over
[33:22] the rough necks they had around and the
[33:24] long-haired and all the rest of it. And
[33:26] I mean, you know, and and uh I couldn't
[33:30] understand how they did business. I just
[33:32] couldn't understand. We offered to fix
[33:34] their cabins up because they were just,
[33:35] as far as I was concerned,
[33:38] and I hope they're listening, just
[33:40] ratinfested things. And I we offered to
[33:43] fix their cabins up. We'll f we'll do it
[33:45] free. We'll go and fix your cabins up.
[33:47] Oh, no, no, no. And then one year they
[33:51] didn't have power to the grounds where
[33:53] we pitched the tent. So, brother Jim
[33:55] Douly came down there with his brought a
[33:58] great big telephone pole and those
[34:00] things, you know, cost nothing but
[34:01] money. and his great big augur digger
[34:05] truck and dug a hole and put up that
[34:08] professional pole and that's all his and
[34:10] strung the cables and everything in
[34:13] there and they finally had power to
[34:15] their that ground. After camp was over
[34:18] they asked us come and move that pole
[34:20] out.
[34:22] So we did go ahead and took the pole
[34:24] out. That's the way they did business.
[34:27] this one time, one of the last times,
[34:30] Brother Tom and Joanne were driving home
[34:33] and you know when you're trying to
[34:34] figure out three times a day times so
[34:37] many young people and so many counselors
[34:39] and then three times a day for the meals
[34:42] and so on so forth. We should have said
[34:43] one time a day cuz those hush puppies or
[34:46] whatever it is they feed you just and
[34:49] corn dogs are my goodness, aren't you
[34:53] glad that's over?
[34:55] We ought to have a roar of amen from the
[34:56] young people. My goodness, I'm glad
[34:59] that's over. And uh we we they're
[35:02] driving home and they're saying, "It
[35:03] seems like there's a mistake.
[35:06] You know, we paid the bill, but it seems
[35:08] like something's just not right." And
[35:10] here they've been already an hour away,
[35:13] almost home. And they finally conclude
[35:17] they've got to be figures as near as we
[35:21] can figure it 11,000. and they
[35:23] undercharge us $11,000.
[35:25] It was all done, finished. We paid them
[35:28] goodbye.
[35:30] So Tom and Joanne turned around and
[35:33] drove back. And by this time, it's, you
[35:36] know, midnight, the wee hours of the
[35:38] morning. And there there's a little
[35:40] light glowing over the dining room
[35:42] table. And there's Bill and his wife,
[35:44] you know, and they're they're they're
[35:46] grinding it out. So Tom knocks on the
[35:49] door.
[35:51] Bill, what are you doing? What are you
[35:54] doing here, Tom? Well, I think you
[35:57] undercharged us. I think you've made a
[35:59] big mistake.
[36:01] He says, "We're trying to figure that
[36:03] out." He, we've been figuring that out.
[36:06] We're trying to figure that out. Well,
[36:08] Tom says, "Well, we figured it out and
[36:09] you've undercharged us by about
[36:11] $11,000."
[36:13] And he said, "And you come all the way
[36:16] back?" He You could have come tomorrow.
[36:19] He was just happy we'd come back,
[36:20] period.
[36:22] He said, "And you come all the way back
[36:25] just to do this?" Tom says, "Well, I
[36:28] didn't think you'd sleep very much, and
[36:29] I knew I wouldn't sleep very much." So,
[36:32] yeah, we came back, sat down, wrote him
[36:34] out a check.
[36:36] He said, "You people are Christians.
[36:39] Real Christians." Tom says, "Well, why
[36:42] isn't that what anybody would do?" He
[36:45] said, 'You wouldn't believe how many
[36:47] churches owe us money yet? For years,
[36:50] they've owed us money.' Tom says, "What
[36:53] kind of people?" He says, "Baptists."
[36:56] [Laughter]
[36:58] So, I was glad we had a better
[37:00] testimony. Amen. Hallelujah.
[37:06] We should be able to have a good record
[37:08] of those on the outside. Amen.
[37:12] What was it we were just singing? Let
[37:14] let's sing. Uh we are standing on holy
[37:16] ground. We just stand up will you please
[37:18] with me? All right. Lift it up to him
[37:21] now.
[37:24] We are standing
[37:30] on holy
[37:32] ground.
[37:36] And I know
[37:39] there are angels
[37:43] all around.
[37:48] Oh, let us praise
[37:54] Jesus.
[37:55] Now
[37:59] we are standing in
[38:04] his presence on holy ground.
[38:09] &gt;&gt; We'll bow in a moment of prayer.
[38:11] Heavenly Father,
[38:13] we believe as we have read in your word,
[38:16] when men or a man or woman or a people
[38:21] when they meet with their maker, meet
[38:25] with their God, then that is a sacred
[38:28] place. We believe tonight this is a
[38:31] sacred place. It's a sacred place
[38:34] because you have spoken. You have given
[38:37] us your word. You've delivered it, oh
[38:40] God, through such a faithful voice and
[38:43] messenger. And now we want to be
[38:45] faithful to the cause. We want to be
[38:47] faithful, oh God, as a witness. And you
[38:49] shall be witnesses, Jesus. You said you
[38:53] shall be witnesses. And here we are at
[38:55] the end of the consummation of the ages.
[38:58] And Lord Jesus, we're here in
[38:59] anticipation for tonight, for this
[39:02] weekend coming up, the beginning, oh
[39:04] God, of of the families coming together
[39:06] and from out of town and wherever. Oh
[39:09] God, may it just rain down with the
[39:12] glory of God upon the people. Do mighty
[39:16] things above all we could ask or think.
[39:19] Lord, I pray the hearts of the people
[39:21] will be not only in expectation, but
[39:24] they will come prepared and ready. And
[39:28] as the minister prays, I pray that they
[39:30] will be in prayer. May they be in prayer
[39:32] through the day and in their work, oh
[39:34] God. Just saying, Lord, have your way.
[39:37] Lord, move amongst us. Lord, prepare my
[39:39] heart. May I be a vessel to receive and
[39:42] be filled to overflowing. Lord, I ask
[39:45] that you will anoint brother Ron
[39:47] Spencer. Uh the singers that sing and
[39:50] the musicians that play, the people who
[39:52] are on the sound and working in the
[39:54] grounds and the deacons, oh God, and the
[39:57] video people, everyone, Lord, the
[39:59] sisters at work and brothers as well,
[40:02] you know, to feed the people. I pray
[40:03] that you will just somehow, oh God, you
[40:06] will do as you've done over all these
[40:08] many, many years. You will give energy
[40:10] and strength to the people. May we serve
[40:13] you with great joy in Jesus name. Now
[40:16] I'm depending upon you, Lord. I pray
[40:19] you'll bless these words tonight and the
[40:21] people as they receive it, anoint me, oh
[40:24] God, to say what needs to be said in
[40:26] Jesus Christ's name. Amen.
[40:30] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[40:31] Going to start from by reading out of
[40:33] Romans the 9th chapter.
[40:38] kind of starting from a little different
[40:40] angle tonight, but I still I want to
[40:42] fill in some
[40:45] uh blanks if I can from Sunday morning
[40:49] and uh where I was speaking on your
[40:51] identification for rapture and uh just
[40:56] you know announce the meeting the
[40:59] service from a little bit of natural
[41:02] things which today is so we grow up with
[41:06] uh having to have identif
[41:07] identification. But I'm interested in
[41:10] identification for rapture. Now, we're
[41:12] going to start to read about verse
[41:17] uh
[41:18] I think we'll read from verse 9. For
[41:22] this is the word of promise at this time
[41:25] will I come and Sarah shall have a son.
[41:28] And not only this, but when Rebecca also
[41:30] had conceived by one, even by our father
[41:33] Isaac, for the children being not yet
[41:35] born, neither having done any good or
[41:39] evil, that the purpose of God according
[41:41] to election might stand. Watch that
[41:44] please. That the word of God, the
[41:46] purpose of God according to election
[41:48] might stand, not of works, but of him
[41:51] that calleth. It was said unto her, the
[41:54] elder shall serve the younger. As it is
[41:57] written, Jacob have I loved, but Esau
[41:59] have I hated. What shall we say then? Is
[42:02] there unrighteousness with God? God
[42:04] forbid. For he saith to Moses, I will
[42:07] have mercy on whom I will have mercy,
[42:10] and I will have compassion on whom I
[42:12] will have compassion. So then, it is not
[42:15] of him that willth, nor of him that
[42:18] runth, but of God that showeth mercy.
[42:21] Amen. God bless you as you have your
[42:24] saints.
[42:28] Verse 18 of this chapter says,
[42:31] "Therefore hath he mercy on whom he will
[42:36] have mercy and whom he will he
[42:40] hardenth." He has mercy on whom he will
[42:43] have mercy and whom he hardeneth whom he
[42:46] willth he hardens. And the scripture is
[42:50] bringing out the sovereignty of God.
[42:53] This is a subject that we can never
[42:57] fully grasp or fully understand. If you
[42:59] could, you'd probably understand God and
[43:02] and he's just beyond our comprehension.
[43:05] Uh now, the reason I'm bringing this
[43:08] from this direction is because the
[43:12] rapture for sure falls under the
[43:15] sovereignty of God. Because brother
[43:18] Brandham says the rapture is a
[43:20] revelation
[43:22] and revelation God is sovereign in his
[43:25] revelation. He's absolutely sovereign.
[43:28] And the the clay or the vessel cannot
[43:32] say to the potter, why hast thou made me
[43:35] thus?
[43:37] &gt;&gt; In the message, who is this Melzdc? I'm
[43:41] laying a foundation. Now, he said, you
[43:43] remember how we read of the scripture
[43:45] which we just read. Now,
[43:47] not him that willth nor him that runth,
[43:51] but God which showeth mercy. See, and
[43:54] that his predestination
[43:56] might stand true. That his
[43:59] predestination
[44:00] might stand true. God's sovereign in his
[44:05] choosing. Would you say amen to that?
[44:08] &gt;&gt; He said, did you know that God's
[44:10] sovereign? Who was back yonder to tell
[44:13] him a better way to make the world?
[44:16] &gt;&gt; Who would dare tell him he was how he
[44:19] was running his business wrong?
[44:22] Even the very word itself very
[44:25] sovereign. Even now here's what I want
[44:27] to get across to you. Even the
[44:29] revelation is sovereign. He reveals to
[44:33] whom he will reveal.
[44:36] &gt;&gt; Amen. I think of course there's a
[44:39] there's a part that we need to play. The
[44:42] part you need to play and I need to play
[44:45] is that we need to be conditioned. We
[44:48] need to keep ourselves in preparation.
[44:51] We need to have ourselves spiritually
[44:54] minded. We also need to yield to the
[44:57] spirit, not to the flesh. If we yield to
[44:59] the flesh, we'll be blinded and we'll
[45:02] we'll we'll have we'll go down the wrong
[45:05] trail. But if we are spiritually minded
[45:08] and he said he reveals to whom he will
[45:10] reveal. He said the very revelation
[45:13] itself is sovereign in God. Now, this,
[45:17] you know, I tell you what, some of
[45:19] brother Brandham's statements really uh
[45:21] cause us to think and turn our head
[45:22] around a wee bit. And I don't want you
[45:24] to uh be, you know, lazy in your mind. I
[45:28] want you to be real thoughtful because
[45:31] it I know it takes me some time to just
[45:34] sit and ponder what it is he's saying.
[45:37] So, I had this up to go onto the screen,
[45:39] but I want to take the time tonight. The
[45:42] very revelation itself is sovereign in
[45:46] God. And that's how people talking about
[45:49] others now. He said they will pound at
[45:51] things and jump at things and hit at
[45:55] things. In other words, there's all
[45:56] kinds of enthusiasm, excitement, and
[45:59] emotion that can take place and not
[46:02] knowing uh what they're doing. He said
[46:05] God is sovereign in his works. I've been
[46:08] in meetings where they, you know, take
[46:09] people, are going to shake people, are
[46:10] going to force them to, you know,
[46:12] whether they speak in tongues are going
[46:14] to force them to get healed or force
[46:15] them. God is sovereign.
[46:17] &gt;&gt; He's just absolutely sovereign. And the
[46:20] more we rest in it, the easier it is.
[46:23] &gt;&gt; We just say, "God, you're sovereign."
[46:27] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[46:28] &gt;&gt; It's not of one who runth. Uh, it's of
[46:32] God who showeth mercy. Not of him that
[46:35] wills or him that runs or what all our
[46:38] stewing and so on. It doesn't achieve
[46:40] anything. It's God that shows mercy. God
[46:44] rich in mercy.
[46:46] &gt;&gt; So we don't want to pound at things. We
[46:48] don't want to just put a whole lot of
[46:50] energy out and not obtain. God is also
[46:55] sovereign in the revelation of the
[46:57] rapture. He's sovereign. And as I have
[47:00] been in this subject and been pondering
[47:02] these things now for some time, I am
[47:06] thoroughly convinced that the truth and
[47:10] the experience of the rapture, as I said
[47:14] several times now and certainly said in
[47:16] a lot of meetings, I do not believe that
[47:19] the the subject of the rapture is
[47:21] something that we just gain more
[47:23] knowledge of the raptures and revelation
[47:26] of the rapture is not more knowledge.
[47:28] The revelation of the rapture is more
[47:30] relationship. We enter into a
[47:32] relationship with him. It's a life with
[47:36] him, a communion with him, an intimacy
[47:39] with him. And until it is like it was
[47:41] with Enoch, who was our type, and we're
[47:43] going to go back to it again this
[47:45] evening. Until God took him,
[47:48] &gt;&gt; his communion with God. He walked with
[47:51] God. He didn't just walk with God,
[47:54] taking a step at a time, but he had a
[47:56] walk with God. had a communion with God
[47:59] and God took him. We'll perhaps come to
[48:01] that a little bit later on. So, I'm
[48:03] convinced that the rapture is a
[48:06] revelation. But that does not take away
[48:09] I want to say it quickly and want you to
[48:11] hear it when we say it's a revelation
[48:15] and I have heard where people uh in the
[48:18] message put so much emphasis on well the
[48:21] rapture is a revelation that you don't
[48:23] know whether they have any belief that
[48:27] there's anything of a physical event
[48:29] that takes place. But the re the rapture
[48:33] is not just some mental exercise. The
[48:37] rapture is an event.
[48:39] &gt;&gt; But I believe that it is a revelation to
[48:42] the believer before it becomes an event
[48:45] to them.
[48:48] &gt;&gt; Salvation is
[48:50] &gt;&gt; even healing is
[48:52] &gt;&gt; it's something that is made real to you.
[48:55] It's made alive to you and then you
[48:57] enter into it.
[48:59] And so now in the message, the rapture,
[49:02] brother Brandham says, "But to the
[49:04] church, the bride, the rapture is a
[49:07] revelation to her." That's why I believe
[49:10] it needs to be preached, needs to be
[49:12] spoken about if God leads in that way.
[49:14] And he's certainly been leading me in
[49:16] this direction. He said it's revealed to
[49:18] her that the revelation the true bride
[49:23] of Christ will will be watch him
[49:27] prophesy now will be waiting
[49:30] &gt;&gt; for that revelation of the rapture.
[49:34] &gt;&gt; Not just a revelation but that
[49:36] revelation of the rapture. The true
[49:38] bride will be waiting for that
[49:42] revelation
[49:45] &gt;&gt; of the rapture. said, "Now it is a
[49:47] revelation for the revelation is faith."
[49:51] Now watch, he takes it onto another
[49:53] little angle. The revelation is faith.
[49:55] You cannot have a revelation without it
[49:59] being faith.
[50:01] &gt;&gt; Faith is a revelation because it's
[50:04] something that's revealed to you. Faith
[50:07] is a revelation. Faith is something that
[50:10] has been revealed to you like it was to
[50:13] Abraham.
[50:14] &gt;&gt; Amen. that could that could call
[50:18] anything contrary to what had been
[50:21] revealed to him as though it was not.
[50:24] Anything that was contrary to what was
[50:27] revealed to him, he disregarded it as
[50:30] though it was not.
[50:32] &gt;&gt; You'll have a child. Your wife will bear
[50:35] a son. And the scripture says in the New
[50:38] Testament that he staggered not at the
[50:41] promise of God. He believed in God.
[50:45] Amen. And you could not get him
[50:49] convinced that his body was dead beyond
[50:52] producing a child. He didn't know how,
[50:55] but he knew it was going to happen
[50:56] because God had said so. And his wife
[51:00] is, regardless of how withered up and
[51:02] dried up and and passed beyond the age,
[51:06] far beyond the age of bringing forth
[51:08] life. And that all speaks to us because
[51:12] it regardless of how far circumstances
[51:16] may come in your own personal life if
[51:22] God has said so. If God has called you
[51:26] to be a believer, you know, one thing,
[51:28] one thing that's good for us when things
[51:30] go really sideways and we experience
[51:33] reversals and have all kinds of
[51:35] difficulties and whatever more in this
[51:37] age, it's good just to bring it down to
[51:40] the lowest common denominator and that
[51:44] is, are you a child of God? Are you a
[51:48] son of God, a daughter of God? You say,
[51:50] "Well, when you reduce it down, I know
[51:52] I'm not a child of the devil. I hate the
[51:55] world. I have no interest in his ways. I
[51:58] have no interest in his pleasures. I
[52:00] have no interest in where he's going."
[52:04] &gt;&gt; I know I'm a child of God.
[52:07] &gt;&gt; And once you have made that declaration,
[52:10] then I can assign to you all the
[52:13] righteousness of Jesus Christ. I can
[52:16] assign to you all the power of heaven on
[52:19] your behalf. I can assign to your
[52:21] account and I can take off of your
[52:24] account all the sin, all the unbelief,
[52:27] everything else because Jesus Christ
[52:30] bore it for you. Hallelujah. I can
[52:33] attribute to you all his righteousness
[52:35] and take away all your unbelief. You are
[52:38] justified in the presence of God and
[52:41] accepted in the beloved.
[52:43] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[52:44] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And sometimes we have to get
[52:45] down to that point.
[52:49] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[52:50] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And one s, you know, you
[52:54] might say, I haven't got a trace of
[52:57] feeling. I haven't got an ounce of
[53:00] emotion. I I don't think my prayer could
[53:03] reach the ceiling. All of that's fine.
[53:06] But when you get down to that lowest
[53:09] that get down to ground zero,
[53:13] I am a child of God.
[53:17] You've got a revelation that hell can't
[53:19] shake.
[53:21] &gt;&gt; That's that's what we're talking about.
[53:23] And right there, faith will act on that
[53:26] confession.
[53:30] &gt;&gt; Amen. Now, we have been a great deal in
[53:33] uh into Luke the 24th chapter, and I'm
[53:36] sure you know it well now. I'm sure that
[53:38] most everyone has been reading it and
[53:40] has been pondering on it. I'm not
[53:42] speaking out of it, but I need to keep
[53:44] referring back to it because it has
[53:48] really it has set for myself personally.
[53:51] It has actually set my whole range of
[53:55] thinking in a different direction. I
[53:58] I've been pondering so long and now over
[54:02] some years how how the prophet has
[54:05] called Luke 24 a prophecy a prophecy
[54:12] made clear uh made clear by the prophecy
[54:16] events made clear by the prophecy that
[54:19] is a powerful thing that God has and
[54:22] then I begin to see how God laid out so
[54:25] many things in the scriptures and to and
[54:27] for myself now tonight and I've been
[54:30] speaking to you as I uh I said I would
[54:35] be speaking to you as God is dealing
[54:36] with me and that I am doing. I'm not
[54:39] here preaching a series of services now
[54:42] as as God keeps dealing with me. I keep
[54:45] bringing it to you and sometimes I don't
[54:48] have a whole lot of you know feeling or
[54:50] enthusiasm about it but I I just see it
[54:53] is something is different and something
[54:56] is seems to be magnified. God takes a
[55:00] certain portion of it and just keeps
[55:02] grinding on it, grinding it down and
[55:05] that's why I keep bringing it to you
[55:07] because it keeps coming in my mind and I
[55:09] can't get away from it. And so when I
[55:12] begin to see over all these many months
[55:14] and even some years that Luke 20 I
[55:17] pondered that for so long years ago I
[55:19] preached on Jesus himself drew near. You
[55:22] may remember that that's that's some
[55:24] years ago. This was already grinding on
[55:27] me then said there is something there.
[55:30] There is a key. There is a secret. When
[55:34] I I thought that was so astounding that
[55:36] brother Brandham and then it became with
[55:38] a greater impact when I realized it was
[55:41] his second last service, second service
[55:44] from the last. And he's talking about
[55:46] now this event's a prophecy. So soon as
[55:50] I looked at as a prophecy, it put it all
[55:52] another light. This these men are
[55:54] walking on the way to Emmas. They don't
[55:56] know. They're actually laying down a
[55:59] prophecy that's going to happen in
[56:01] reality to someone else. It's happening
[56:04] to two people there. But they they're
[56:06] walking with the resurrected Christ. But
[56:09] there's going to be a whole group of
[56:10] people that are going to walk with the
[56:12] resurrected ones. This is their this is
[56:15] their prophecy. And it's going to happen
[56:18] in in a in a in a full way. Amen. Oh,
[56:24] and when you think then it's got to go a
[56:27] step further. It has to come to the
[56:30] place where you identify and that's why
[56:32] I come to identification. You identify
[56:34] with a specific scripture that scripture
[56:38] is speaking of me.
[56:41] Who are you John the Baptist? Who are
[56:45] you?
[56:46] Who are you? He could have said
[56:49] Elizabeth's my mother. Zachcharias is my
[56:52] father. You've known me since, you know,
[56:55] since my birth. All of these things.
[56:57] We've lived here. My father has he has
[57:00] been in the temple all the time. But his
[57:03] only identification was, I am one.
[57:07] &gt;&gt; I am the voice of one crying in the
[57:10] wilderness. Isaiah had to say that. When
[57:14] Isaiah said that, he was prophesying of
[57:17] one man. And when that one man came on
[57:20] the scene, he reached right back because
[57:22] he also was a prophet messenger. Reached
[57:25] right back, laid hold of that scripture
[57:27] and says, "This is my ID."
[57:30] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. This is my identification.
[57:34] &gt;&gt; If you want to know who I am, this is
[57:36] who I am.
[57:38] &gt;&gt; Amen. Didn't say I'm John or didn't say
[57:41] anything.
[57:42] When Jesus was asked many times about
[57:46] where did he get his authority and why
[57:48] are you doing a certain thing and this
[57:50] is the Sabbath and why have you done
[57:52] this? Why have you commanded this man to
[57:54] you know carry his bed and all of these
[57:56] things? Why why don't your disciples pay
[57:58] tribute and washing of hands and all of
[58:00] these things you know he never gave
[58:03] himself an identity back to his parents.
[58:08] never gave himself or to his mother, I
[58:10] should say, never gave himself any
[58:12] identity to Joseph. Never gave himself
[58:15] identity to the synagogue or to the
[58:17] priesthood or to the high priest or to
[58:21] the Levites. Never gave himself any
[58:24] identity that way. His identity was
[58:26] always, "It is written."
[58:29] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. It is written. We as
[58:32] believers in this end time really need
[58:34] to let that be absorbed and not
[58:37] forgotten when we go out this door. We
[58:39] need to be able to go far beyond where
[58:43] we were born and what country we lived
[58:46] in and where we've been educated. That
[58:49] stuff ought to leave us essentially and
[58:51] say, "I am here because God called me.
[58:55] God called my name. I can tell you the
[58:57] place. I can point back to the place
[58:59] where God dealt with me and different
[59:02] stations in my life. I've been to Bethl.
[59:05] I've been to this mountain. I've been in
[59:07] that valley. I've been in a lot of
[59:09] places. But that's my identity. My
[59:12] identity is here in the word of God.
[59:15] &gt;&gt; And that's really the direction I'm
[59:17] coming from.
[59:20] &gt;&gt; I think that's really the direction that
[59:22] we need to come from.
[59:24] We need
[59:26] to have a whole lot less connection
[59:30] with everything that's down here. We're
[59:33] involved with it. You can be involved as
[59:36] involved as you need to be, but as far
[59:39] as feeling that real connection, you
[59:43] know, we don't have to be connected to
[59:45] it.
[59:47] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[59:51] &gt;&gt; This is our church.
[59:53] Uh, we love this place.
[59:56] We've put a lot of hours, hundreds of
[59:59] hours, and we've put our earnings and
[1:00:02] all of this. I tell you what, this
[1:00:04] building and this land and this parking
[1:00:07] lot means just about nothing to me.
[1:00:11] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. I'm ready to leave it at a
[1:00:13] moment's notice.
[1:00:15] &gt;&gt; Anything that we have and not not
[1:00:17] necessarily even to go in a rapture. If
[1:00:20] God would say, "Leave this and go over
[1:00:23] here. Leave this and I want you to go to
[1:00:26] the native Indians." And he spoke to me
[1:00:28] the way he spoke to me to come here in
[1:00:30] the first place. I can tell you what,
[1:00:32] friends. I can tell you I've left too
[1:00:34] many things to to say anything
[1:00:36] otherwise. I'd be history. I'd be out of
[1:00:39] here. I'd call the board together and I
[1:00:41] say, "God has said something to me." And
[1:00:43] how it's going to happen, I don't know.
[1:00:45] And what's going to happen when I get
[1:00:46] there, I don't know. But I'm on my way.
[1:00:49] Hallelujah. We've got to be able to hang
[1:00:51] on to things loosely.
[1:00:56] &gt;&gt; So now, the sovereignty of God is so
[1:00:59] evident in Luke the 24th chapter. Just I
[1:01:03] just want to draw and filling in some
[1:01:04] blanks. Now the sovereignty of God when
[1:01:08] the scripture says and it came to pass.
[1:01:11] Now this is the prophecy. And it came to
[1:01:14] pass and I can say that here tonight as
[1:01:17] I look from one face and one family to
[1:01:20] another to another. I can say and it
[1:01:22] came to pass as it did here in the as it
[1:01:25] did in the prophecy. So has it in the
[1:01:28] fulfillment that Jesus himself drew
[1:01:31] near.
[1:01:33] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. It wasn't another person. It
[1:01:36] wasn't just a good sermon. It might have
[1:01:38] been in a meeting. It might have been in
[1:01:40] a special place or or someplace that
[1:01:43] wasn't special that the Holy Spirit
[1:01:46] begin to speak to you. And we can say
[1:01:48] tonight and it came to pass. It was here
[1:01:51] in the it was here in the prophecy.
[1:01:53] Amen.
[1:01:54] &gt;&gt; But now in the end time, hallelujah,
[1:01:57] when a prophet says that this is a
[1:01:59] prophecy for this time, I can say, "And
[1:02:02] it did come to pass in the end times
[1:02:05] that Jesus himself, the resurrected one,
[1:02:09] drew near
[1:02:12] &gt;&gt; and went with them."
[1:02:17] &gt;&gt; God in his sovereignty.
[1:02:20] Oh,
[1:02:22] &gt;&gt; I need you to absorb that
[1:02:26] &gt;&gt; in his sovereignty.
[1:02:28] &gt;&gt; Now, you might wonder about yourself
[1:02:29] tonight and say, "Well, I don't know if
[1:02:31] that really I don't know if that really
[1:02:33] uh has reference to me." What are you
[1:02:34] doing here?
[1:02:36] &gt;&gt; How did you get here?
[1:02:39] &gt;&gt; I say that you're here. You're here on
[1:02:41] this Wednesday night. even young people,
[1:02:44] teenagers, whatever more. There's a
[1:02:45] there's all kinds of places where
[1:02:47] teenagers are tonight in malls and this
[1:02:49] and that and all kinds of entertainment
[1:02:51] of the world. And all of you people uh
[1:02:54] got jobs and responsibilities and
[1:02:56] mothers with children and whatever more.
[1:02:58] And if you're unattached, you got all
[1:02:59] kinds of places you could have gone, but
[1:03:01] you're here in the house of God. I say,
[1:03:04] why are you here? I can tell you you're
[1:03:06] here whether you want to accept it or
[1:03:08] not. You're here because Jesus Christ
[1:03:10] himself drew near and went with you.
[1:03:15] [Applause]
[1:03:16] &gt;&gt; He's the one who talked with you when
[1:03:19] you didn't realize who was talking to
[1:03:21] you. He was the one you poured your woes
[1:03:24] out to.
[1:03:26] And this is the sovereignty of God.
[1:03:29] There was a lot of people in Israel.
[1:03:32] And there were disciples, mighty
[1:03:34] apostles.
[1:03:37] But Jesus,
[1:03:39] God himself, selected these two men. One
[1:03:44] has never been named.
[1:03:49] That's what we know about him.
[1:03:52] But you will meet him one day and you'll
[1:03:56] find you'll discover who it was that is
[1:03:59] called Cleopus's friend.
[1:04:02] You'll meet him. But in the mind of
[1:04:04] Almighty God, this unnamed man,
[1:04:08] unnamed,
[1:04:12] you'll find that in the mind of God, it
[1:04:16] was predestinated
[1:04:18] by election that he would be the one
[1:04:21] that would walk and have opportunity to
[1:04:24] speak with the Lord Jesus and be the
[1:04:26] first to do so at that on that level.
[1:04:30] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:04:32] This is the bride's type.
[1:04:34] &gt;&gt; This is your type.
[1:04:37] &gt;&gt; Who are you?
[1:04:40] I'm in Luke 24.
[1:04:43] &gt;&gt; I'm one of those that Jesus Christ
[1:04:45] himself drew near.
[1:04:47] &gt;&gt; He came on my pathway. Who are you? I
[1:04:51] heard the resurrected Christ speak.
[1:04:54] [Applause]
[1:04:55] [Music]
[1:04:56] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:04:58] and he told me and instructed me,
[1:05:01] revealed to me. He was alive. It is a
[1:05:04] personal revelation. It's not something
[1:05:06] I just gained in my mind. This isn't an
[1:05:08] Easter story I heard a preacher preach.
[1:05:11] This is something I experienced. I
[1:05:14] walked down the road. He walked with me.
[1:05:17] My pathway, not the synagogue, not the
[1:05:20] church. My road. My pathway. Hallelujah.
[1:05:24] my problem, my trouble, my sadness. He
[1:05:28] walked with me. Why? I don't know.
[1:05:31] That's his choosing. But he did it.
[1:05:33] That's the sovereign God. Sovereign
[1:05:36] almighty God.
[1:05:38] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Why did he choose to? None
[1:05:40] of our business. Who they are? None of
[1:05:43] our business. Why did he choose you?
[1:05:45] None of our business. He did it.
[1:05:47] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Why did you hear it? I don't
[1:05:50] know. None of my business. He did it.
[1:05:53] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. You heard it. Why are you
[1:05:55] young people born in a believer's home?
[1:05:57] I don't know. None of my business.
[1:05:59] That's God sovereign.
[1:06:02] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:06:04] &gt;&gt; I say hallelujah.
[1:06:06] &gt;&gt; Are you worthy? None of us is worthy.
[1:06:09] You'll never be worthy.
[1:06:11] &gt;&gt; You'll never be worthy. You'll never
[1:06:14] gain that status.
[1:06:16] &gt;&gt; Why did he do it? Because he's God.
[1:06:18] Because he's sovereign. The revelation
[1:06:20] is sovereign. Faith is sovereign. The
[1:06:22] whole thing is sovereign
[1:06:25] &gt;&gt; and the clay has no business. Pass the
[1:06:28] potter. Why did you do it thus? Why did
[1:06:31] you do it thus? Why did they have to
[1:06:33] live it back there? I don't know. But
[1:06:35] they did it for us.
[1:06:37] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:06:39] &gt;&gt; And that made the whole Bible
[1:06:41] &gt;&gt; a different book for me, too. Amen.
[1:06:44] &gt;&gt; Just in the last short time,
[1:06:46] &gt;&gt; begin to realize those men were, Brother
[1:06:48] Brandham says, those prophets spoke
[1:06:50] things they would never have said.
[1:06:55] &gt;&gt; They would never have spoke it if they
[1:06:57] knew, but they were moved. The scripture
[1:07:00] says they were moved
[1:07:02] by the Holy Ghost and they spake. And as
[1:07:06] I said, Sunday and David said, "All my
[1:07:09] bones, they stare at me."
[1:07:13] at me and brother Brandham says me
[1:07:15] speaking of himself it sounded personal
[1:07:18] but he's speaking right he was speaking
[1:07:20] of Christ
[1:07:22] now
[1:07:24] I had a question and I I know that a lot
[1:07:27] of people had the question
[1:07:30] and brother Brandon makes a statement
[1:07:32] and I'm just going right to the right to
[1:07:34] the core of it right now he said when he
[1:07:37] says but the brightest of she is him
[1:07:40] he says another place that the wife come
[1:07:43] out of the, you know, the wife is part
[1:07:46] of the husband
[1:07:47] because he's talking from a spiritual
[1:07:49] sense. The wife is part of the husband
[1:07:51] and the husband and the wife through
[1:07:53] holy marriage and bring forth the
[1:07:55] children. They all it all all comes from
[1:07:59] him in a spiritual sense because it all
[1:08:02] comes from the father.
[1:08:04] You understand?
[1:08:06] &gt;&gt; Are you with me?
[1:08:08] &gt;&gt; All right. Now, so the Holy Spirit of
[1:08:12] God
[1:08:15] way back, we'll say back because we're
[1:08:19] creatures of time, caused men to say
[1:08:23] certain things and to speak and they
[1:08:24] were moved by the Holy Spirit and caused
[1:08:27] women who were the type of the bride to
[1:08:30] do certain things, but they were moved
[1:08:32] of the Holy Spirit. They were moved of
[1:08:35] God.
[1:08:35] &gt;&gt; Amen. You can you can never convince me
[1:08:38] that Tamar
[1:08:40] could explain to anybody what she was
[1:08:43] doing.
[1:08:44] &gt;&gt; You could never get anybody to anybody
[1:08:47] who's a sound Bible believer to to
[1:08:50] believe that that Tamar had it all
[1:08:52] figured out. She didn't have anything.
[1:08:54] All she knew she also was being moved.
[1:08:58] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:08:59] &gt;&gt; Because it was written that he shall be
[1:09:03] of the tribe of Judah. And Satan was
[1:09:06] trying to eliminate them.
[1:09:09] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And it was just hanging on a
[1:09:10] thread, but she was moved of God. Cast
[1:09:14] down her reputation.
[1:09:16] &gt;&gt; And as the songwriter said, she stared
[1:09:19] the burning and the sword in the face.
[1:09:21] And the stone, she should have been
[1:09:23] stoned, but she paid no attention to
[1:09:25] that because there was something driving
[1:09:27] her, moving her. There must be a son in
[1:09:30] this lineage.
[1:09:33] &gt;&gt; She couldn't explain that.
[1:09:35] Sovereign Almighty God driving her
[1:09:38] &gt;&gt; beyond all of her reasoning.
[1:09:41] &gt;&gt; She's a type.
[1:09:44] &gt;&gt; You're laying down a prophecy.
[1:09:46] &gt;&gt; Laying down a prophecy in her life that
[1:09:49] there would be those kind of people that
[1:09:51] would be driven beyond all reason,
[1:09:54] beyond all understanding, beyond their
[1:09:56] own, beyond any measure they think that
[1:09:58] they possess. They're driven.
[1:10:01] &gt;&gt; Why? Because Christ must be expressed
[1:10:05] &gt;&gt; in this day.
[1:10:08] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:10:09] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:10:14] &gt;&gt; God and his sovereignty.
[1:10:17] You could never get them to understand
[1:10:20] what it was and what was causing them to
[1:10:23] do what they were doing.
[1:10:28] Prophet said in modern events once again
[1:10:31] said Jesus is up from the dead and
[1:10:34] living among his people. And what a
[1:10:37] beautiful thought. He's here the same
[1:10:40] today as he was that day and the day
[1:10:45] he's referring to. I I spoke this but I
[1:10:47] did not give you the actual quote. He
[1:10:50] spoke this in reference to the two men
[1:10:53] on the way to Emmas and Jesus is there
[1:10:57] walking with them. Was it real?
[1:11:00] Absolutely it was real.
[1:11:04] Couldn't be more real.
[1:11:06] A living person walking with them. And
[1:11:09] he says and he is here. He's here the
[1:11:13] same. And the same now in identification
[1:11:17] is identical.
[1:11:19] It's identical. You cannot show another
[1:11:21] picture at the border. When you cross a
[1:11:24] border, it has to be your picture.
[1:11:26] &gt;&gt; It has to be a recent picture. It's time
[1:11:29] sensitive.
[1:11:30] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:11:31] &gt;&gt; And we are not going back 500 years
[1:11:34] trying to have our example back there.
[1:11:37] Our example is one of today. This is the
[1:11:40] message of the hour. This is an end time
[1:11:43] message to an end time people as a it's
[1:11:47] a solution to end time conditions. Do
[1:11:50] you believe it?
[1:11:51] &gt;&gt; It's an answer to end time problems.
[1:11:54] Hallelujah. It's the solution for end
[1:11:57] time children, end time families, end
[1:12:00] time churches. Hallelujah. I'm glad I'm
[1:12:03] part of the end time people, the Exodus
[1:12:06] people. Amen.
[1:12:09] &gt;&gt; This is not some weak watered down
[1:12:11] message that we have.
[1:12:13] &gt;&gt; And he's here today as he was that day.
[1:12:18] &gt;&gt; That was the prophecy. And I'd suggest
[1:12:21] that the fulfillment, if anything, is
[1:12:24] more real than even the prophecy.
[1:12:29] &gt;&gt; More real.
[1:12:30] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:12:36] Jesus is moving amongst his people today
[1:12:39] more than he did even in other ages.
[1:12:43] And yet the people are having exactly
[1:12:45] the same response.
[1:12:48] Now,
[1:12:51] brother Brandham had to point to his his
[1:12:53] scriptures
[1:12:57] and you know where part of his
[1:12:58] scriptures was
[1:13:00] in Revelation 3.
[1:13:03] and he identified it. I read it today.
[1:13:07] He only referred to the scripture.
[1:13:11] They put him out.
[1:13:14] &gt;&gt; They put Jesus out.
[1:13:16] &gt;&gt; They put him on the outside. Thrust him
[1:13:18] out. And he just kept bringing the
[1:13:21] scripture. I'm going to read you another
[1:13:23] quote in just a moment reading pointed
[1:13:26] to a scripture just like just like John
[1:13:29] the Baptist said, "I'm the voice of one
[1:13:31] crying in the wilderness." And they
[1:13:33] said, "Ah, you're no voice." He could
[1:13:35] have said, "What are you doing here
[1:13:36] then?
[1:13:38] Why are you here?" People talk about
[1:13:41] brother Brandham said, "Oh, he's no
[1:13:43] prophet or he's this or they're just
[1:13:44] following a dead man." Well, then what
[1:13:46] are they what are they so stirred up
[1:13:47] about
[1:13:49] &gt;&gt; if it's just nothing? If it doesn't mean
[1:13:51] anything and the person was nobody, what
[1:13:54] what's all the excitement? What's all
[1:13:55] the stir? Why are you here?
[1:13:59] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen?
[1:14:01] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. We've heard a certain sound.
[1:14:04] &gt;&gt; Glory to God.
[1:14:06] &gt;&gt; And so the prophet, he just he just goes
[1:14:08] to Luke, I'm sorry, to uh Revelation the
[1:14:12] 3rd chapter verse about 2021 and there
[1:14:16] and behold, I stand at the door and
[1:14:18] knock. He said he was thrust out
[1:14:21] and right at the time he was thrust out.
[1:14:24] &gt;&gt; That's what he's talking about. That was
[1:14:26] the prophecy.
[1:14:27] &gt;&gt; That was prophetic and he's living it
[1:14:30] out.
[1:14:31] &gt;&gt; His ministry is a fulfillment of it.
[1:14:36] John the Baptist says of him, could we
[1:14:40] identify him with any denomination?
[1:14:42] He came in the same at the same time
[1:14:45] there was many denominations
[1:14:47] and he never affiliated himself with any
[1:14:50] of them.
[1:14:51] &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham is saying that because
[1:14:53] it extends further. He said so we
[1:14:56] couldn't say that he was a Pharisee or a
[1:14:59] Sadducee
[1:15:00] &gt;&gt; or so forth. We wouldn't identify him
[1:15:04] with a certain denomination.
[1:15:07] So we couldn't say he was a Pharisee or
[1:15:10] Sadducee. says he come for the people.
[1:15:13] He goes on to say if he come he would
[1:15:16] have see the same way he's here tonight
[1:15:20] to heal those who accept him to save
[1:15:22] those who will accept him. He comes in
[1:15:24] in the form in the same form in the same
[1:15:27] way if he come he would have to come in
[1:15:31] a scriptural identification now that's I
[1:15:35] want you to catch that phrase scriptural
[1:15:38] identification. If he came,
[1:15:42] Jesus who came and visited earth when he
[1:15:45] came he didn't identify himself with a
[1:15:48] synagogue
[1:15:49] &gt;&gt; or his earthly family or his lineage. He
[1:15:53] never gave it.
[1:15:57] Never identified himself with any of
[1:15:59] these things.
[1:16:02] &gt;&gt; He always identified himself with a
[1:16:04] scripture. It would be good for us not
[1:16:07] to hear this just as a Wednesday
[1:16:09] service, but to go out from this place
[1:16:11] and say that has to be my pattern.
[1:16:14] &gt;&gt; I have to see myself in the scripture
[1:16:17] and make that my identification.
[1:16:21] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:16:23] &gt;&gt; Who are you?
[1:16:25] &gt;&gt; I'm a person that's heard a certain
[1:16:27] sound.
[1:16:29] &gt;&gt; I've heard a certain sound. I've heard a
[1:16:32] voice. What voice did you hear? was
[1:16:34] Malachi 4 5 and 6. I heard a voice,
[1:16:39] &gt;&gt; a restoring voice,
[1:16:42] &gt;&gt; a prophetic voice. I've heard that
[1:16:45] voice. That's why I am what I am.
[1:16:49] &gt;&gt; That's why we are who we are.
[1:16:54] &gt;&gt; In Jesus Christ, the same yesterday,
[1:16:55] today, and forever. Just listen. Now,
[1:16:57] this this carries on just a wee bit. And
[1:16:59] I've only taken very selected uh very
[1:17:02] selected verses. I mean uh portions out
[1:17:05] of this account. Jesus identified
[1:17:08] himself as prophet revealing the secrets
[1:17:11] of the heart. That's how he identified
[1:17:13] himself. And brother Brandham said
[1:17:16] Jesus identified himself a scriptural
[1:17:19] identification to the Jews. Please
[1:17:21] notice the identification. I gave it I
[1:17:24] gave it to you in quite some detail on
[1:17:28] Sunday. But he said to the Jews that he
[1:17:32] was the Messiah by being a prophet. That
[1:17:36] was his identification.
[1:17:39] &gt;&gt; Who are you? So he he manifested or he
[1:17:43] showed himself. He showed his life and
[1:17:48] he he demonstrated that he was a
[1:17:51] prophet. And by demonstrating he was a
[1:17:54] prophet,
[1:17:56] that proved he was the Messiah.
[1:17:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:18:01] &gt;&gt; By being a prophet, that was his
[1:18:04] identification.
[1:18:05] A Messiah is the anointed one.
[1:18:08] &gt;&gt; And Christ is the anointed one.
[1:18:11] &gt;&gt; The prophets were anointed ones.
[1:18:15] &gt;&gt; You are anointed ones.
[1:18:17] &gt;&gt; And there are false anointed ones.
[1:18:25] Are you with me?
[1:18:26] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:18:28] &gt;&gt; Absolutely.
[1:18:30] But this was his identification.
[1:18:33] And Jesus identified himself as a
[1:18:35] prophet by revealing the secrets of the
[1:18:37] heart. He identified himself as a
[1:18:39] messiah to the Jews by perceiving the
[1:18:42] thoughts that was in their heart by
[1:18:45] speaking to them their names and
[1:18:46] different things. And they knew that he
[1:18:49] was the prophet that the Lord had
[1:18:51] promised to raise up. Now listen, those
[1:18:54] real true ones
[1:18:58] who was predestinated
[1:19:00] to that.
[1:19:02] &gt;&gt; They were predestinated to that proof.
[1:19:06] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:19:07] &gt;&gt; I'm going slow.
[1:19:10] Take that as a prophecy. There are real
[1:19:14] true ones
[1:19:16] &gt;&gt; in this last hour
[1:19:19] &gt;&gt; that
[1:19:23] they are predestinated to that sign.
[1:19:26] They're predestinated to that voice. You
[1:19:29] are here waiting for it. You didn't
[1:19:31] perhaps even know it, but you were here
[1:19:33] waiting. Nothing else fit.
[1:19:36] &gt;&gt; Nothing else actually satisfied
[1:19:40] to the depths. It didn't fit you
[1:19:42] completely. Oh, you tried this and you
[1:19:44] tried that. You tried the world. You
[1:19:46] tried sin. You tried church. You tried
[1:19:48] religion. This one, that one, and the
[1:19:50] other one. But somehow it didn't fit.
[1:19:53] Then one day, one day, not because we're
[1:19:56] saying so, but one day is my experience.
[1:20:00] &gt;&gt; I'm testifying tonight. One day
[1:20:03] something just came to me inside and the
[1:20:06] answers of my soul were the questions
[1:20:10] were answered.
[1:20:11] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And it fit.
[1:20:14] &gt;&gt; It was just perfect.
[1:20:16] &gt;&gt; And I never had to search again. It was
[1:20:18] all over. The search was done.
[1:20:21] &gt;&gt; Not because I was a minister. I wasn't I
[1:20:23] wasn't at that time I couldn't minister
[1:20:25] those things because they weren't a
[1:20:26] reality to me.
[1:20:28] &gt;&gt; I was a young fellow with a lot of
[1:20:30] questions. But one day the answer came.
[1:20:33] One day the voice came. One day the book
[1:20:36] became a totally new book.
[1:20:39] &gt;&gt; And it kept unfolding and unfolding and
[1:20:41] still a new book.
[1:20:45] &gt;&gt; And so he says
[1:20:47] he identified himself as the Messiah to
[1:20:51] the Jews by perceiving the thoughts that
[1:20:54] was in their hearts. Now he's speaking a
[1:20:56] message here and he's actually got a
[1:20:59] prayer line in front of him. Notice how
[1:21:01] he moves through this. I actually have
[1:21:04] gone back in my experience
[1:21:06] to a greater simplicity than perhaps I
[1:21:10] have even I haven't had the same degree
[1:21:12] of appreciation for the simplicity.
[1:21:16] I wish I could. I'm just going to tell
[1:21:19] you I I gave you a whole about eight or
[1:21:23] 10 of him just calling the people by
[1:21:25] name. Listen to me, my brother, my
[1:21:28] sister, for this little brother up here
[1:21:31] called Ed Biscll. To me, that is one of
[1:21:33] the most astounding,
[1:21:36] indescribable
[1:21:38] mysteries.
[1:21:40] I cannot grasp. I cannot even explain
[1:21:44] where a man goes that stands there on
[1:21:47] the floor like any other man stands on
[1:21:49] the floor and looks like anyone else and
[1:21:52] when he gets warm persspires and
[1:21:54] whatever more and and and stand there
[1:21:57] and and look at people and be obviously
[1:22:02] in some other place.
[1:22:05] Where is he?
[1:22:08] And if you can explain some kind of a
[1:22:10] gift where people have been trying to
[1:22:11] explain it for decades, why did God do
[1:22:14] it?
[1:22:15] &gt;&gt; Obviously, it's not of man.
[1:22:18] &gt;&gt; It's something that's supernatural.
[1:22:20] &gt;&gt; And we cannot find any place in history
[1:22:22] it's ever been done. Why was it done
[1:22:25] now? Why was it done? Well, we could
[1:22:28] say, "Well, it was the end time." All
[1:22:29] right, fine. It's the end time. But
[1:22:31] what's going to happen in the end time?
[1:22:33] I can tell you now if you're going to go
[1:22:35] back to the same man who spoke these
[1:22:37] things, he said that was done to the
[1:22:40] Jews because that was a sign to the real
[1:22:44] true elect ones
[1:22:48] &gt;&gt; to them. And he said he did it to the
[1:22:50] Jews and he did it to the Samaritans but
[1:22:53] never once did it to the Gentiles. Never
[1:22:56] once. Never once. Never once. And then
[1:22:59] suddenly here in your generation and in
[1:23:02] my generation here it comes.
[1:23:06] &gt;&gt; Never was done before. Who are you?
[1:23:09] &gt;&gt; The two men on the way to Emmas. Who are
[1:23:12] you ladies who run to the tomb? Who are
[1:23:14] you? I can't explain it, but he did it.
[1:23:17] &gt;&gt; And I don't know why he did it, but he
[1:23:19] did it. He did it because he's
[1:23:21] sovereign. He did it because he does
[1:23:24] what he willth.
[1:23:26] &gt;&gt; And we have no choice. We have nothing
[1:23:29] to say about it. He touched your heart
[1:23:31] wherever you were.
[1:23:34] &gt;&gt; Oh my. I just got to be forceful tonight
[1:23:37] and bring this home to you, my friend.
[1:23:40] It's God.
[1:23:42] &gt;&gt; It is God. It is not your doing or my
[1:23:44] doing. It's not a preacher. It's not
[1:23:47] even William Brandom. It's the God that
[1:23:49] chose him.
[1:23:50] &gt;&gt; He said he didn't even want that life.
[1:23:52] He wanted to be a trapper.
[1:23:54] &gt;&gt; It wasn't him. He wanted to be a
[1:23:56] trapper. He couldn't be a trapper
[1:23:58] because God is sovereign.
[1:24:00] &gt;&gt; It's God who said you're going to live
[1:24:01] in you're going to live in motel. You're
[1:24:03] going to live in hotels. You're going to
[1:24:05] be driven around. You're going to have
[1:24:06] people pulling at you. You're going to
[1:24:08] have people waiting for you. You're
[1:24:10] never going to have hardly a moment's
[1:24:11] notice. You're going to have to run to
[1:24:13] even get a little time by yourself.
[1:24:15] You're going to have to run.
[1:24:18] &gt;&gt; It's not our doing.
[1:24:20] &gt;&gt; It's not our choosing. Not his choice.
[1:24:22] It's not your choice. God called you.
[1:24:25] &gt;&gt; Amen. Sovereign God said, "You're going
[1:24:28] to come.
[1:24:29] &gt;&gt; You're going to leave your family.
[1:24:31] You're going to leave your friends.
[1:24:32] You're going to leave your associates.
[1:24:34] And you're going to follow me."
[1:24:36] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:24:37] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:24:39] &gt;&gt; And I'm going to reveal myself to you.
[1:24:43] &gt;&gt; I'm going to stay with you. And Jesus
[1:24:45] himself drew near and went with you.
[1:24:48] &gt;&gt; Went with them.
[1:24:50] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. You thought you're going to
[1:24:51] run away from it, but you couldn't run.
[1:24:53] You couldn't get away from him because
[1:24:55] he went with you.
[1:25:03] The real true ones.
[1:25:08] I said I wanted to find out what what he
[1:25:10] really meant by real.
[1:25:13] The real ones. Real is to have actual
[1:25:16] existence.
[1:25:19] Real is not theoretical.
[1:25:22] Real is not theory.
[1:25:25] &gt;&gt; Real is not imaginary.
[1:25:27] &gt;&gt; Real is to have genuine existence.
[1:25:31] &gt;&gt; That's real. And so what he's saying is
[1:25:35] the real or the the the the true ones
[1:25:41] have and and true and and real ones.
[1:25:45] And to be true is to be faithful
[1:25:50] to fact or reality, conformable to an
[1:25:54] existing pattern that's true ones, true
[1:25:58] to the pattern. And he goes on in the
[1:26:01] same message, Jesus Christ the same
[1:26:03] yesterday, today, and forever in Hot
[1:26:04] Springs, Arkansas.
[1:26:08] And he goes on, notice now, I just want
[1:26:10] you to stay with me. He said he promised
[1:26:12] here to identify himself among us the
[1:26:16] same way that he did. He keeps going
[1:26:18] back. He promised to identify himself.
[1:26:21] He said he he used the scriptural
[1:26:23] identification
[1:26:25] and he promised to identify himself. He
[1:26:28] says now you say
[1:26:30] here it is. But you say but how did he
[1:26:36] identify himself?
[1:26:38] He asks a question. Then he answers it.
[1:26:41] If we can hear him speak,
[1:26:44] if we can hear him speak,
[1:26:47] then that identifies him of being with
[1:26:51] us.
[1:26:54] &gt;&gt; I want to say to you tonight,
[1:26:56] if we can hear him speak,
[1:27:00] isn't that complicated? No. It's so
[1:27:04] simple. If you stumble over anything,
[1:27:06] you could stumble over that. If we can
[1:27:08] hear him speak,
[1:27:10] say, "Open your ears.
[1:27:12] Open your hearts." If you can hear him
[1:27:15] speak, that means he's identifying
[1:27:19] himself with you.
[1:27:22] You may not understand what he's saying,
[1:27:25] but if you can hear him speak, maybe
[1:27:27] you're hearing Brother Ed Biscll
[1:27:28] tonight, but there's something that's
[1:27:30] beyond that voice. There's something
[1:27:31] even beyond the service tonight say, you
[1:27:34] know, something is moving within my
[1:27:36] heart. It is something more than just a
[1:27:38] sermon, more than just Wednesday night.
[1:27:41] Then that identifies him going with you.
[1:27:55] and to know that he's among us and can
[1:27:58] reach up and realize now he says now
[1:28:01] it's identification of Christ among his
[1:28:04] people God working in human flesh
[1:28:09] &gt;&gt; God was working through that prophet's
[1:28:11] flesh
[1:28:14] &gt;&gt; he said you remember
[1:28:16] now he's going back oh my I I I
[1:28:21] hope you're able to stay with me just a
[1:28:23] few more minutes
[1:28:25] Now he goes back to his prophecy.
[1:28:28] &gt;&gt; He says, "Now remember it. It didn't go
[1:28:31] to Babylon and it didn't go to Sodom."
[1:28:34] So he's immediately back to the three
[1:28:36] messengers.
[1:28:38] &gt;&gt; He goes back to the three messengers and
[1:28:41] immediately identifies that he didn't go
[1:28:44] to Sodom.
[1:28:46] &gt;&gt; It didn't go to Sodom. The voice you
[1:28:49] heard never went to Sodom.
[1:28:51] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:28:53] &gt;&gt; It stayed
[1:28:54] stayed on the other side of the desert.
[1:28:57] &gt;&gt; Stayed before Abraham and it stays
[1:29:00] tonight before Abraham's seed.
[1:29:03] &gt;&gt; Doesn't go to Sodom. Said it never went
[1:29:05] to Babylon. Glory to God. It's not down
[1:29:09] in those denominations. You won't find
[1:29:11] it in those big tombstones. You won't
[1:29:14] find it there, my brother, my sister.
[1:29:16] You will not find it there. It stayed
[1:29:18] with Abraham and his children.
[1:29:23] Amen.
[1:29:24] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:29:24] &gt;&gt; And because you heard his voice
[1:29:26] &gt;&gt; that identifies that's your
[1:29:29] identification.
[1:29:30] &gt;&gt; You can walk out of here tonight and
[1:29:31] says, "I got my spiritual ID." What is
[1:29:34] it? He spoke to me in the way.
[1:29:37] &gt;&gt; I have my ID.
[1:29:42] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:29:44] &gt;&gt; Never went to Babylon. Did not go to
[1:29:46] Sodom.
[1:29:47] &gt;&gt; It was to the called out. I'm called
[1:29:50] out.
[1:29:51] &gt;&gt; Why don't you say that? I'm called out.
[1:29:54] &gt;&gt; You want to say that? Identify yourself.
[1:29:56] I am called out. And he has identified
[1:29:59] himself with me.
[1:30:00] &gt;&gt; Glory to God.
[1:30:02] &gt;&gt; I tell you, my brother, my sister, I
[1:30:04] don't know about you, but I'm having a
[1:30:05] feast on this subject.
[1:30:08] I want to preach it with the full
[1:30:10] intended in intention of leaving out of
[1:30:12] here.
[1:30:14] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:30:18] Oh my.
[1:30:20] &gt;&gt; He says, "But this Lord Jesus Christ in
[1:30:22] the form of the Holy Spirit moving among
[1:30:24] his people doing the same thing that he
[1:30:26] did when he was here on earth
[1:30:28] identifying himself." He says it again
[1:30:30] all the way through this. Jesus Christ
[1:30:32] the same identifying himself. How do we
[1:30:34] know he's identifying himself? Because
[1:30:36] you hear his voice.
[1:30:40] &gt;&gt; And he says, "I do not know." Now he
[1:30:43] moves right up. He says, "I do not know.
[1:30:45] Only God made the promise." Now, he's
[1:30:47] he's like he's saying he's confessing,
[1:30:49] "God's sovereign. I don't know if he's
[1:30:51] going to do anything. There's a woman
[1:30:53] standing here. I don't know if he's
[1:30:54] going to do anything." Isn't that
[1:30:56] humble? Isn't that simple? Isn't that
[1:30:59] beautiful? It puts it down in all of our
[1:31:02] understanding. He's here. I I don't know
[1:31:04] if he's going to do anything. What's he
[1:31:06] saying? With as much as he knows and as
[1:31:08] many visions as he's had, he's saying to
[1:31:10] the people, "God is sovereign.
[1:31:13] I don't know if he's going to do
[1:31:15] anything.
[1:31:16] &gt;&gt; He says only God made the promise.
[1:31:20] &gt;&gt; But if he will
[1:31:22] &gt;&gt; identify himself here,
[1:31:24] &gt;&gt; if he will identify himself here,
[1:31:28] &gt;&gt; sir, we would see Jesus. And that's the
[1:31:30] only way that you, he said, you can't
[1:31:32] impersonate that
[1:31:34] &gt;&gt; cuz it's a miracle. And now here stands
[1:31:37] a woman. And I haven't a bit more idea
[1:31:40] what that woman's standing here there
[1:31:42] for, than anybody does. What is a
[1:31:45] messenger doing? He's gone through a
[1:31:47] whole long series of statements and
[1:31:49] paragraphs bringing the people so
[1:31:52] tenderly all the way up. All the way up.
[1:31:55] How will he identify? How will you know
[1:31:56] it be identified? Because he speak to
[1:31:58] you. What is he preparing them for? cuz
[1:32:00] the same son of God is going to speak
[1:32:03] out of that mouth to identify himself
[1:32:07] there on the platform.
[1:32:09] &gt;&gt; And you're a chosen elected people.
[1:32:12] You've heard his voice. You didn't have
[1:32:14] to stand on the platform. Blessed are
[1:32:16] they who believe who have not sinned.
[1:32:20] &gt;&gt; I don't know where those people are, but
[1:32:22] for the most part, they're all gone. But
[1:32:25] here you are.
[1:32:26] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Here you are.
[1:32:28] &gt;&gt; Glory to God. Here I am. I'm I'm not
[1:32:32] preaching tonight. I'm rejoicing. I'm
[1:32:34] rejoicing in my own salvation.
[1:32:37] Hallelujah. I'm rejoicing that I at
[1:32:40] family and been able to be a family in
[1:32:43] in the midst of this family as brothers
[1:32:46] and sisters have heard the same voice.
[1:32:48] I'm rejoicing.
[1:32:50] &gt;&gt; This thing's a reality to me.
[1:32:52] &gt;&gt; We're not wasting our time, friends.
[1:32:54] We're not here playing church. We're on
[1:32:57] our way to this real place.
[1:33:00] Hallelujah.
[1:33:01] [Applause]
[1:33:04] &gt;&gt; And if he'll identify himself and he
[1:33:07] says, "Here stands a woman. I have no
[1:33:08] idea what what's wrong." Uh he says,
[1:33:11] "Standing here or that than anybody else
[1:33:14] does. And here he is to identify his
[1:33:18] church to give it rapturing faith." And
[1:33:21] here he is.
[1:33:22] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:33:24] &gt;&gt; To identify himself. Number one. To
[1:33:27] identify himself. And number two, to
[1:33:29] give them rapturing faith.
[1:33:32] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:33:33] &gt;&gt; They missed it.
[1:33:34] &gt;&gt; And there's a group of people that got
[1:33:36] it.
[1:33:38] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:33:40] &gt;&gt; He's identified himself.
[1:33:42] &gt;&gt; I can put you on the spot saying,
[1:33:44] "You're here, aren't you?
[1:33:45] &gt;&gt; You're here.
[1:33:47] &gt;&gt; You've driven away from home. You've
[1:33:48] driven across the land. You've come
[1:33:50] across why did you? You needed to hear
[1:33:52] this. Your body on the other side was
[1:33:54] calling for this service.
[1:33:57] You need to hear these things.
[1:33:59] &gt;&gt; The Holy Spirit is bringing it to you
[1:34:02] cuz the body is calling for it.
[1:34:05] &gt;&gt; Glory to God. Rapturing faith. Why do he
[1:34:08] identify himself? To give you rapturing
[1:34:10] faith and that faith of revelation.
[1:34:17] &gt;&gt; And the lady, he said he's the lady's
[1:34:19] just come from an operation. Said, "I
[1:34:22] don't know if he's going to do anything.
[1:34:23] He's sovereign.
[1:34:25] &gt;&gt; But if he will, he'll be identifying
[1:34:26] himself. Identifying himself for the
[1:34:29] purpose of letting you know that he's
[1:34:31] going to speak to you. And number two,
[1:34:33] that you're your He's going to give you
[1:34:35] rapturing faith.
[1:34:37] &gt;&gt; And he said, "She's here. The lady's
[1:34:39] just come from an operation." That is
[1:34:42] right. A female trouble and you've had
[1:34:45] an operation and you're suffering from a
[1:34:47] real weakness and nervousness. That is
[1:34:50] right. Can't hardly recover from it. And
[1:34:53] tonight before coming, you prayed that
[1:34:56] you would be able to get here and be
[1:34:59] prayed for in a prayer line. Brother
[1:35:01] Phantom is so specific. Other times he
[1:35:03] says, "I hear you praying and you prayed
[1:35:06] that I would call you."
[1:35:08] &gt;&gt; This time he said, he even named her
[1:35:10] prayer. He said, "You prayed that you'd
[1:35:12] get in the prayer line." And she's
[1:35:14] standing there as the first person in
[1:35:16] the prayer line. He said, "Raise up your
[1:35:18] hand. I'm not reading your mind. You'll
[1:35:21] believe with all your heart, Mrs.
[1:35:22] Gideon.
[1:35:24] &gt;&gt; Believe.
[1:35:26] &gt;&gt; What have they just seen? They've seen
[1:35:28] the rapture sign. They've heard the
[1:35:30] rapture voice from the rapture prophet.
[1:35:34] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:35:35] &gt;&gt; But they didn't catch the sign. They
[1:35:37] thought it was a little gift. But I can
[1:35:39] tell you our type Ruth, she wasn't
[1:35:41] excited about the gifts. Rebecca wasn't
[1:35:44] excited about the gifts. Rebecca said,
[1:35:46] "Just give me Isaac."
[1:35:48] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Ruth was just saying, "Just
[1:35:50] redeem me. Just redeem me. Hallelujah.
[1:35:54] I'm not interested in the field. I'm not
[1:35:56] interested in the barley. Just redeem
[1:35:58] me." That's our type. Hallelujah.
[1:36:02] &gt;&gt; Glory to God.
[1:36:05] &gt;&gt; It's our identification in the Old
[1:36:07] Testament. It's all over the Old
[1:36:10] Testament.
[1:36:15] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:36:17] Amen.
[1:36:19] &gt;&gt; Well,
[1:36:22] &gt;&gt; I don't feel like quitting. I don't feel
[1:36:24] like going on. So, I'll just quit. I
[1:36:28] think
[1:36:30] what I'll do. Maybe we'll save a little
[1:36:32] bit for Sunday.
[1:36:34] &gt;&gt; It's all right to fill in some blanks,
[1:36:36] isn't it?
[1:36:37] &gt;&gt; You like those blanks?
[1:36:41] Ah, hallelujah. It's our subject,
[1:36:44] friends.
[1:36:45] &gt;&gt; It's our life.
[1:36:47] We've got a baptism. And the baptism is
[1:36:51] this young one's going to be identified
[1:36:53] with him in his death.
[1:36:56] &gt;&gt; And when she comes out of the water,
[1:36:58] she'll be saying, "I'm identified in his
[1:37:01] resurrection."
[1:37:02] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:37:04] &gt;&gt; And I believe as God seals her into the
[1:37:06] kingdom of God, she'll be identified in
[1:37:09] the res in the rapture as well, walking
[1:37:12] with the saints in white.
[1:37:14] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:37:15] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Brother Derry, come and help
[1:37:17] me with a song. My voice about gone.
[1:37:20] Let's have the sister go and get ready
[1:37:22] for baptism for the Tom. Hallelujah.
[1:37:26] &gt;&gt; Oh, we just uh I don't know. Things are
[1:37:29] just building up. We just got a phone
[1:37:31] call today from uh
[1:37:34] oh, brother Marcus, sister Anne's dad
[1:37:38] from New Zealand. Greetings to the
[1:37:41] congregation. A special love to you,
[1:37:43] Sister Anne and Brother Marcus. And uh
[1:37:46] he's going to be arriving the 29th and
[1:37:49] uh I don't know what you've got planned
[1:37:50] as a family, but I'll announce publicly
[1:37:53] I've got him slated for one of the
[1:37:55] weekends.
[1:37:58] He said, "Whatever whatever is planned
[1:38:00] for me, but oh, I love hearing Brother
[1:38:02] Donaldson minister.
[1:38:03] &gt;&gt; He just got a fire down within his
[1:38:06] bones. It's just so rich and wonderful.
[1:38:08] He got a man of prayer. I really love
[1:38:10] him." Amen. Well, let's sing a song.
[1:38:13] Brother Derek, you can come up here.
[1:38:18] Amen. Isn't it wonderful? Will you pray
[1:38:21] for Sunday?
[1:38:23] &gt;&gt; We need all the prayers we can have. God
[1:38:26] bless you.
[1:38:29] I've been changed.

[1:38:54] it made
[1:38:57] his way. All my life, praise God, has
[1:39:01] been changed.
[1:39:04] And I've been to the water and I've been

[1:39:13] lamb.

[1:39:41] Lord has his way. All my life. Praise
[1:39:46] God. As we change
[1:39:50] my sins as far, they're white as snow. I
[1:39:56] was found, but today I am free.
[1:40:01] I was lost in darkness, but now I found.
[1:40:07] I was blind, but now I see.

[1:40:36] And when at last in his presence I stand
[1:40:40] above. Oh, he will wipe everything from
[1:40:45] my eyes.
[1:40:47] And I'll thank him for living
[1:40:52] like me. I
[1:40:55] belong.

[1:42:32] &gt;&gt; My heart is set right.
[1:42:35] &gt;&gt; We'll start with the first verse.
[1:42:37] Amazing
[1:42:40] grace, how sweet the sound that save a
[1:42:46] rest like me.

[1:45:44] Amen. God bless you as you have your
[1:45:46] seats, Brother Tom.
[1:45:48] &gt;&gt; Very appropriate,
[1:45:51] &gt;&gt; Sister Haley. I've got my mind made up.
[1:45:53] I've got my heart set right. What a time
[1:45:56] to be going into camp. If God's doing
[1:45:58] this before camp,
[1:46:00] &gt;&gt; what is he going to do after camp?
[1:46:02] Praise the Lord. God's in the saving
[1:46:04] business, isn't he?
[1:46:06] &gt;&gt; You know the wonderful thing about this
[1:46:07] identification with the road to Emmas,
[1:46:10] the Bible says, "And their eyes were
[1:46:13] open.
[1:46:14] and they knew him.
[1:46:16] &gt;&gt; So if the resurrection has come by your
[1:46:18] way then our eyes need to be open.
[1:46:21] &gt;&gt; And you know many times we we are
[1:46:23] expecting a great move and the great
[1:46:25] move is a soul.
[1:46:28] &gt;&gt; Brother Bram talked about the campaign
[1:46:29] going to Chicago. We preached over the
[1:46:32] years a great campaign will take place.
[1:46:33] A great revival will take place
[1:46:36] &gt;&gt; and they were expecting great numbers.
[1:46:38] And brother Bram said the revival took
[1:46:39] place when that little girl came
[1:46:41] &gt;&gt; and gave her heart to the Lord. I
[1:46:44] believe we're in a revival of the
[1:46:46] opening of the word. The rapture is on
[1:46:48] us and God is opening eyes of his elect.
[1:46:53] &gt;&gt; Amen. And sister Haley Mat is here in
[1:46:55] the baptismal tank with me this evening
[1:46:58] because God's open her eyes. Many young
[1:47:01] people come to church, young people, old
[1:47:03] people alike come to church, but if your
[1:47:06] eyes aren't open, you don't get
[1:47:08] identified with this death, burial, and
[1:47:11] resurrection. But once God opens your
[1:47:13] eyes, you can't keep a person from being
[1:47:16] identified with his death, burial, and
[1:47:19] resurrection.
[1:47:20] &gt;&gt; Amen. And that's what's wonderful. And
[1:47:22] then you got a a mother
[1:47:25] &gt;&gt; hear a preacher preach, confess it,
[1:47:28] speak it, speak it again, and speak it
[1:47:31] again. What' she speak? She said, "Lord,
[1:47:33] the salvation of my daughter."
[1:47:36] &gt;&gt; And that night, little Haley gave her
[1:47:39] heart to the Lord.
[1:47:42] It's a wonderful thing.
[1:47:44] &gt;&gt; And God is dealing mightily. And I I
[1:47:46] love what brother John the Baptist had
[1:47:49] said. He said, "I can indeed baptize you
[1:47:52] with water,
[1:47:53] &gt;&gt; but there's one coming
[1:47:55] &gt;&gt; that will baptize you, Sister Haley,
[1:47:57] with the Holy Ghost and fire." And may
[1:48:01] that be your portion as you surrender
[1:48:03] your life to Christ. Maybe you'd like to
[1:48:05] say something for the Lord, sister. You
[1:48:07] know, my she was when we came in.
[1:48:12] All right, let's just bow our heads in a
[1:48:13] word of prayer.
[1:48:16] Heavenly Father, you're doing something
[1:48:19] very special within the church of the
[1:48:21] living God. Lord, it's a great thing to
[1:48:24] see our children come to the realization
[1:48:26] of Jesus Christ as their savior. And
[1:48:29] Lord Haley has come to that place not
[1:48:31] only to identify Lord God in the
[1:48:34] salvation of her soul, taking a hold of
[1:48:37] Calvary, taking a hold of the cross. She
[1:48:40] wants to be identified in your death,
[1:48:42] Lord, to be identified in your
[1:48:43] resurrection. So, Father, I'm praying
[1:48:46] that you will take this little vessel,
[1:48:49] Lord, one that you've chosen before the
[1:48:51] foundation of the world. God, would you
[1:48:53] indeed baptize her with the Holy Ghost
[1:48:56] and fire? Lord God, I pray that you'll
[1:48:58] set her soul a flame, that she will know
[1:49:01] you in a greater way, Lord, that she
[1:49:03] will become into relationship with the
[1:49:06] living God. Fill her
[1:49:08] &gt;&gt; with the Holy Ghost
[1:49:10] &gt;&gt; is my prayer tonight. Father in Jesus
[1:49:13] name and sister Haley,
[1:49:16] by your confession that Jesus Christ is
[1:49:18] your savior, I baptize you in true
[1:49:21] Christian baptism in the name of our
[1:49:25] Lord Jesus Christ. Amen.
[1:49:31] [Applause]
[1:49:39] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:49:40] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:49:41] &gt;&gt; Amen. Let's all stand if we can. We'll
[1:49:44] sing one more chorus as we close. I'll
[1:49:47] ask brother DDA to come and dismiss us
[1:49:49] in a word of prayer. I'm not ashamed of
[1:49:52] the gospel.
[1:49:53] &gt;&gt; The gospel of Jesus Christ.
[1:49:58] I'm not ashamed
[1:50:02] of the gospel.
[1:50:07] The gospel of Jesus
[1:50:09] Christ.
[1:50:11] [Music]
[1:50:14] I'm not afraid
[1:50:18] to mountain,
[1:50:22] but I'm willing to hear.
[1:50:26] [Music]
[1:50:30] See, I'm ready to be
[1:50:34] all he wants me to be
[1:50:40] after.
[1:50:46] Oh, I am thou shame
[1:50:50] of the goel.
[1:50:53] [Music]
[1:51:05] Father, we're thankful tonight.
[1:51:08] Our hearts truly rejoice, too.
[1:51:11] hear your word and feel the Holy Spirit
[1:51:15] pressing this revelation into our
[1:51:17] hearts, oh God,
[1:51:19] Father, to see and to know that
[1:51:23] we are the substance of all the shadows.
[1:51:27] And we can look back in your word and
[1:51:30] see that you wrote it with us in mind,
[1:51:32] Father. Lord, tonight we do want to
[1:51:35] thank you for speaking to our hearts
[1:51:38] once again, Father.
[1:51:40] We believe that your word is that seed
[1:51:42] that has fallen into a good ground
[1:51:44] tonight that it'll bring forth a
[1:51:46] revelation. Oh God, it'll bring forth a
[1:51:48] closeness,
[1:51:50] a walk with you, God. I pray that your
[1:51:53] children will be encouraged and
[1:51:55] strengthened. That they'll go, God, with
[1:51:58] this atmosphere that we have sensed and
[1:51:59] felt tonight, they will take it with us,
[1:52:02] Father, knowing that you have drawn near
[1:52:04] to walk with us all the way to the end.
[1:52:08] Walk with us, Jesus.
[1:52:10] As we come to the end of the service, we
[1:52:13] commit every life into your hand. Your
[1:52:15] servant was preached and labored, oh
[1:52:17] God. Strengthen him, renew him for
[1:52:20] Sunday, Father, and every heart, oh God,
[1:52:23] as we look toward this week of camp. We
[1:52:26] just pray that you'll work every detail,
[1:52:29] Father, that all will be according to
[1:52:30] your perfect will. We commit all lives
[1:52:33] to you, Father, in Jesus name. Amen.
[1:52:41] &gt;&gt; Amen. God bless you as you go. Sunday,
[1:52:45] one service, Sunday morning, camp
[1:52:47] starts. Sunday afternoon, come prayed
[1:52:50] up. Amen. If you haven't paid for camp,
[1:52:53] make sure that you swing by the office
[1:52:56] quickly on your way out. Take care of
[1:52:58] those arrangements.
[1:53:00] God bless you. Meditate on these things.
[1:53:03] Speak often on these things that we have
[1:53:04] heard. Keep it in the forefront of your
[1:53:06] mind. If it's being preached, we need
[1:53:08] it.
[1:53:09] &gt;&gt; Amen. God bless you. See you on Sunday.
