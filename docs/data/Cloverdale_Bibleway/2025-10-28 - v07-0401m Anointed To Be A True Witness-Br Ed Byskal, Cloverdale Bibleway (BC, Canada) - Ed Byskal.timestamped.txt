[1:31] Good morning. Want to greet everyone in
[1:33] the name of our Lord Jesus Christ. I'd
[1:36] like to turn this morning to number 768.
[1:40] There's a land that is fairer than day.
[1:42] Amen.
[1:43] There are souls calling for.
[1:51] There's a [singing] land that [music] is
[1:53] fair.
[1:57] And by faith we can see it.
[2:03] For the father waits over the way
[2:09] to prepare [music] us a dwelling place.
[2:16] In the sweet [music]
[2:18] by and by
[2:22] we shall [singing] be on that [music]
[2:24] beautiful show
[2:28] in the sweet [music]
[2:34] shall
[2:36] that be.
[2:40] Oh, we shall sing on that beautiful
[2:44] shore.
[2:46] The melodious [music and singing]
[2:48] songs on the
[2:52] [music] spidey
[2:59] [music and singing]
[3:00] for the blessing of rest
[3:04] in the sweet. [music]
[3:10] We shall be [singing] on [music] that
[3:12] beautiful
[3:16] In the sweet [music]
[3:22] we shall be on that [music and singing]
[3:24] beautiful
[3:28] to our bount.
[3:30] [music and singing]
[3:34] He will [music] offer us a tribute of
[3:38] praise
[3:40] for the glorious [music and singing]
[3:42] gift of his love
[3:46] and the blessings [music]
[3:48] that have
[3:52] in [music] the sweet
[3:55] by and by
[3:58] we shall be [music]
[3:59] on that beautiful shore. Oh,
[4:04] in the sweet [music]
[4:07] and high
[4:10] we shall [music] be on that beautiful.
[4:16] &gt;&gt; Amen. Going to be there.
[4:21] &gt;&gt; I'd like to also sing number 468.
[4:26] had it not been, you know, the only way
[4:28] we could we could get to that shore is
[4:31] because of our Lord that died for us.
[4:35] Just reading in in the family altar, I
[4:37] guess it was, Brother Brandon was
[4:39] saying, "Well, I I sure wouldn't want to
[4:41] try and get to heaven on our own
[4:42] merits." And it was something actually
[4:44] to hear him say, [music] "Wouldn't want
[4:46] to try and get to heaven on my
[4:47] preaching. I wouldn't want to try to get
[4:48] to heaven on my visions." I thought,
[4:50] "Well, if if he couldn't do it, how how
[4:53] are we ever going to how are we ever
[4:54] going to see that land? It's it's only
[4:56] through Christ. Amen. So that's why we
[4:58] come this morning just focus on him.
[5:01] Let's all stand [music] as we sing it.
[5:04] Oh, had it not been for a place
[5:08] [singing] called Mount
[5:11] [music]
[5:14] [singing]
[5:18] [music]
[5:22] [music]
[5:26] of Jesus [singing]
[5:30] and forever
[5:32] my soul. Had
[5:36] it not been
[5:39] [music and singing]
[5:40] for
[5:45] [music]
[5:47] nothing
[5:50] [singing]
[5:51] [music]
[5:55] [singing]
[5:57] [music]
[5:59] of Jesus.
[6:03] Then forever [music]
[6:05] my soul
[6:07] would be
[6:11] not
[6:13] for a place called
[6:16] [music]
[6:19] it not
[6:21] for the old. [singing]
[6:24] [music]
[6:27] had nothing [singing]
[6:29] for a man [music]
[6:32] of Jesus
[6:35] and forever
[6:38] my soul.
[6:40] [music and singing]
[6:43] I am redeemed.
[6:47] Born with [singing]
[6:49] a [music]
[6:52] Jesus
[6:54] has changed my whole life.
[7:00] If anybody [music]
[7:03] asks [singing] you
[7:05] just who I am, [music]
[7:09] tell [singing] them
[7:11] I am
[7:14] [music]
[7:18] I am
[7:22] [singing]
[7:22] [music] with a
[7:26] Jesus
[7:28] changed My whole lifebody [music]
[7:39] just
[7:41] I am [music]
[7:43] telling [singing]
[7:45] I [music] am redeemed.
[7:52] I [music] am redeemed
[7:56] [music and singing] with a cross.
[8:00] Jesus
[8:02] has changed my whole life.
[8:08] If anybody [music and singing]
[8:11] asks you
[8:13] just who I am, [music]
[8:19] I am redeemed. [music]
[8:24] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[8:25] &gt;&gt; I'm going to ask at this time if brother
[8:28] David Bernoff, if you'd come and lead us
[8:30] in a word of prayer. Amen. We're so glad
[8:32] we can [music] approach the throne of
[8:34] God and with that on our lips, we are
[8:36] redeemed. Amen. and we can come boldly
[8:38] in his presence this morning. Brother
[8:40] Dave, if you come,
[8:45] let's bow our heads.
[8:49] Heavenly Father, I'm so thankful, Lord,
[8:50] that I can lift up my voice and say, "I
[8:53] am redeemed, Father."
[8:56] And the prophet of God's taught us that
[8:58] our body will come subject to our
[9:00] confession, Lord.
[9:02] We confess this morning, Lord, that we
[9:04] are redeemed by the blood of the lamb,
[9:06] Lord.
[9:08] &gt;&gt; And Father, we like our brother was
[9:11] saying earlier, we know it's not on our
[9:13] merits, Lord Jesus. If there's a word
[9:16] that just keeps getting bigger and
[9:18] bigger to me, Father, and it's grace,
[9:21] &gt;&gt; grace, grace, grace, Father,
[9:25] we realize none of us are going to make
[9:26] it in this flesh, Lord. It's it's solely
[9:30] trusting in the work of Calvary, Father.
[9:34] And yet, Lord, we want to do what we can
[9:36] in this life to live a life worthy of
[9:38] the gospel, Father.
[9:41] &gt;&gt; So, Lord, we're here to hear your word
[9:43] once more. We pray that you will bless
[9:45] your servant [music] who's waited on
[9:46] you. We've tried to prepare our own
[9:49] hearts, Father. We're we want to enter
[9:51] your courts with praise and thanksgiving
[9:53] because you are worthy, Lord.
[9:56] So bless us in divine presence.
[9:59] &gt;&gt; Take this meeting under your divine
[10:01] control Lord and let no one go out of
[10:04] this building without feeling the touch
[10:05] of God in their lives. We I pray father
[10:09] in Jesus name. Amen.
[10:14] &gt;&gt; Sing it one more time before we have our
[10:16] seats. I am [music]
[10:19] redeemed.
[10:22] [singing]
[10:22] [music]
[10:26] Jesus
[10:28] has changed [singing] my whole life.
[10:36] [music]
[10:40] just [music and singing]
[10:42] I am.

[10:54] Melissa Snow has a
[10:56] special for us this morning. if she'd
[10:58] come at this time.

[11:04] those that are joining with us on the
[11:07] internet and on the phone hookup. God
[11:08] bless you.
[11:11] We have an engagement announcement.

[11:15] Tim and Susan Hoffer are proud to
[11:17] announce the engagement of their
[11:19] children, Sister Stephanie Manard and
[11:21] Timothy Hoffer. Amen. So, God bless
[11:23] them.
[11:25] &gt;&gt; Sure, everybody knows Tim. And for those
[11:26] of you that don't know, uh, Sister
[11:28] Stephanie down in Phoenix, that'd be,

[25:56] &gt;&gt; Amen. Come with expectation.
[25:59] &gt;&gt; Then God will certainly see that you're
[26:01] not disappointed.
[26:03] &gt;&gt; If you put in for a small order,
[26:05] &gt;&gt; that's what you get.
[26:07] &gt;&gt; But we ask largely,
[26:10] &gt;&gt; then that's what we'll get. Amen. God
[26:13] bless you. You may be seated.
[26:16] I'm just going to make a couple of uh
[26:19] announcements. First, the deacons have
[26:22] asked me to
[26:24] uh make more clear regarding the
[26:29] u announcement which we made uh
[26:33] regarding prayer requests rather than
[26:35] bringing them here and having us read
[26:37] them. Uh but they wanted to know and I
[26:41] guess there were some questions to them.
[26:43] Are are the people that are not well
[26:45] here able to be prayed for? Oh my
[26:47] goodness. Absolutely. That's what we're
[26:49] here for. And you're come and be prayed
[26:52] for. All it was was concerning long
[26:55] writtenout requests and we're reading
[26:58] them and reading them service after
[26:59] service. So we said that bring a cloth.
[27:03] Bring an anointed cloth. bring a bring
[27:05] something that you would like to have
[27:07] prayed over and we'll pray for it here.
[27:09] And uh
[27:12] I I think maybe just writing out a
[27:14] request comes a lot easier.
[27:17] And uh I I noticed since we made that
[27:20] request, we haven't had a single
[27:21] handkerchief.
[27:24] And that's what the Bible says. So, if
[27:27] you if you're really burdened and you
[27:29] really want to have somebody prayed for
[27:31] that's not here, you'd like to send
[27:33] something to them and have them have
[27:36] have a a cloth or anointed cloth prayed
[27:39] for over, then that's what we'll do
[27:41] here. Because I noticed, Brother
[27:42] Brandham says on the tapes, we've got
[27:44] all these anointed. We got these claws
[27:46] and these handkerchiefs and aprons and
[27:48] whatever more and they took from the
[27:50] bodies of the apostles and and gave
[27:53] those claws and people were healed. And
[27:56] so I just want to go back to the
[27:58] pattern. I think that's fine. I really
[28:01] think that's fine. When we were a lot
[28:03] smaller and it is actually this isn't
[28:05] this isn't anything sudden at all. has
[28:07] been really on my mind for a long time
[28:09] and I'm rather slow to move and do
[28:12] things sometimes, but Moses was slow.
[28:15] Brother Brandham said he was slow. So,
[28:16] I'm in good company.
[28:19] We'll all be slow a wee bit. Don't want
[28:22] to be too slow preaching. However, we
[28:25] take too much time. Uh so, I hope that
[28:29] that is clear. We we're just happy to
[28:31] pray with anybody that's here physically
[28:34] that's not well. You feel free as always
[28:37] to come and be prayed for. And this is
[28:40] the house of deliverance. Not only a
[28:43] house of worship, a house of
[28:45] deliverance. And I quite frankly am a
[28:47] very firm believer that he confirmed his
[28:50] word with signs following. And if the
[28:54] word is being preached, you should
[28:56] expect an answer from God. Don't come
[28:59] here not expecting to receive from God.
[29:03] You should come expecting to receive
[29:05] whatever your need is. Amen.
[29:13] Going to be turning to the word in a few
[29:15] minutes, but there's a verse of a a
[29:18] song, a very common song at Calvary,
[29:22] which we all know. And uh
[29:27] the last verse, we're just going to sing
[29:29] the chorus and the last verse. In the
[29:31] chorus,
[29:33] the last verse says, "Oh, the love that
[29:37] drew salvation's plan.
[29:40] Oh, the grace that brought it down to
[29:45] man.
[29:46] Oh, the mighty gulf that God did span at
[29:51] Calvary." And we're coming up to Easter
[29:54] now. We got a flyer in the mail, and
[29:57] perhaps you did, too. was from Jehovah's
[29:59] Witnesses
[30:01] and they were making a an announcement.
[30:03] The greatest man, the death of the
[30:06] greatest man that ever lived. And I had
[30:08] glanced it over, but they didn't say
[30:10] anything about his resurrection.
[30:13] [laughter]
[30:13] Might have something to do with what
[30:15] they believe. I don't know. I have some
[30:17] pretty good idea. But we're not
[30:20] celebrating
[30:21] a death only. We're celebrating a
[30:23] resurrection.
[30:25] We're not just not just the death, but
[30:27] it's the life that we're celebrating.
[30:30] And it was a life. It was a body that
[30:32] couldn't corrupt.
[30:35] &gt;&gt; It was a life that couldn't stay in the
[30:37] tomb. [music] And it's a life that's
[30:40] been passed on.
[30:43] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. All the love that drew
[30:46] salvation's plan. And all the grace that
[30:50] brought it down to man. This is very
[30:52] very much in line with what I want to
[30:55] speak about today. And so I've got to
[30:56] try to capture capture your thoughts
[30:59] early. Would ask you to be very focused
[31:03] and for me. Help me. All right. You do
[31:07] that. It'll really help me. God bless
[31:08] your brother Tony head. But even shaking
[31:10] brother Tony's hands at Rebecca since
[31:13] they've been back. And
[31:16] Amen.
[31:18] Nice to have everybody here.
[31:26] Oh
[31:28] drew salvation [singing]
[31:31] plan.
[31:32] Oh the grace that brought it down
[31:36] [music and singing] to man.
[31:39] Oh, the mighty God that
[31:42] [singing and music] God desper
[31:48] [singing]

[31:53] [singing]
[32:01] [music]
[32:07] [music and singing]
[32:10] at
[32:14] stand as we sing the last verse once
[32:16] again. Oh the love from salvation.
[32:20] [music and singing]
[32:23] Oh, the race that [singing] brought it
[32:26] down to man.

[33:06] &gt;&gt; Let's thank him, shall we?
[33:09] How gracious, how wonderful you are,
[33:12] Lord.
[33:14] We're thinking of this time of the year
[33:16] especially Lord
[33:19] the time of you entering in and the
[33:23] people were praising and worshiping and
[33:25] throwing their garments down waving
[33:29] palms and a short time later crying
[33:32] crucify crucify. But there was no great
[33:36] voice or shouting except the angels
[33:38] rejoicing when you raised came out of
[33:42] the tomb and began to make yourself
[33:44] known. And today we're here to give you
[33:47] thanks, Lord Jesus. How thankful we are
[33:50] that you have made yourself known.
[33:53] Almighty God, by the Holy Spirit, you
[33:56] have sent the spirit of revelation. and
[33:59] you've sent the anointing upon us that
[34:01] we have been given eyes to see. And we
[34:05] thank you for what we see. We thank you,
[34:07] Lord, for the things that you'll still
[34:09] show us. And we pray that you will
[34:12] magnify yourself amongst us, oh God. I
[34:15] pray that you will demonstrate your
[34:17] power, bind every evil spirit, every
[34:21] hindering spirit. Lord, I pray you'll
[34:23] loose, oh God, our our minds that seem
[34:26] so
[34:28] so encumbered sometime. I pray that
[34:31] you'll remove all the weights, oh God,
[34:33] and the things that so easily be
[34:35] satisfather, in the name of Jesus, give
[34:38] liberty to your word, I pray. Give
[34:40] uncction to it. Let the Holy Spirit be
[34:43] the speaker, I pray. And may each person
[34:47] receive what they have need of. Bless
[34:50] all that are with us, Father, streaming
[34:54] at this moment. May it not just be a
[34:58] stream of our my voice, but may there be
[35:02] a stream of the Holy Spirit, the very
[35:05] presence of the divine one coming into
[35:09] their rooms and into their places of
[35:11] worship. In Jesus Christ's name we ask
[35:14] it. [music] Amen.
[35:16] Amen.
[35:19] I'll invite you to take your Bibles and
[35:21] turn to John's Gospel, the first
[35:25] chapter.
[35:26] [clears throat]
[35:27] And we're going to be reading
[35:32] such a familiar scripture starting with
[35:34] verse one
[35:37] down to verse five and then we'll read
[35:40] verse 14. Keep your Bibles open because
[35:42] we're turning to other brief scriptures
[35:45] after this.
[35:50] In the beginning was the word and the
[35:54] word was with God and the word was God.
[35:58] The same was in the beginning with God.
[36:02] All things were made by him and without
[36:05] him was not anything made that was made.
[36:09] In him was life and the life was the
[36:12] light of man. [clears throat]
[36:14] And the light shineth in darkness, and
[36:17] the darkness comprehended it not. Down
[36:20] to verse 14.
[36:24] And the word was made flesh and dwelt
[36:26] among us, and we beheld his glory, the
[36:29] glory as of the only begotten of the
[36:32] father, full of grace and truth. Down to
[36:36] verse 18.
[36:38] No man hath seen God at any time.
[36:42] The only begotten son, which is in the
[36:45] bosom of the father, he hath declared
[36:48] him.
[36:50] Turn to chapter 8 if you would please
[36:59] and verse 42.
[37:05] Jesus said unto them,
[37:09] "If God were your father,
[37:12] you would love me, for I proceeded forth
[37:17] and came from God."
[37:20] Oh, the grace that brought it down to
[37:23] man.
[37:25] &gt;&gt; For I proceeded forth and came from God.
[37:30] Neither came I of myself,
[37:33] but he sent me.
[37:43] Turn to chapter 20.
[38:00] In verse 21,
[38:04] he just showed them his hands in his
[38:06] sight after the resurrection.
[38:09] Then said Jesus to them again, "Peace be
[38:13] unto you,
[38:15] as my father hath sent me,
[38:20] even so send I you."
[38:24] And when he had said this, he breathed
[38:28] on them and said unto them, Receive ye
[38:32] the Holy Ghost
[38:35] as my father hath sent me, said, I
[38:38] proceeded forth from God.
[38:42] &gt;&gt; And now he's saying after his
[38:44] resurrection, as my father hath sent me,
[38:49] even so send I you. And when he had said
[38:53] this, he breathed on them and said,
[38:57] "Receive ye the Holy Ghost." You may be
[39:00] seated.
[39:06] [clears throat]
[39:06] The scripture tells us also Peter
[39:09] preaching and
[39:11] soon after
[39:13] this experience and they'd received the
[39:14] Holy Spirit. He's telling the people how
[39:18] that God anointed Jesus of Nazareth with
[39:22] the Holy Ghost and with power, who went
[39:26] about doing good and healing all that
[39:28] were oppressed of the devil, for God was
[39:31] with him. Whenever we read John 1,
[39:37] it always confronts a minister with a
[39:40] tremendous challenge
[39:42] because we're starting in the beginning.
[39:46] In the beginning
[39:48] was the word and from the beginning you
[39:51] can go anywhere. It's so vast. It's so
[39:56] such an expanse of of place to go and
[40:01] it's always a little bit of a challenge
[40:04] to where do we go from here in the
[40:07] beginning. But I want to I want to focus
[40:11] our thoughts because I've been speaking
[40:13] the last two Sundays
[40:16] on anointed for rapture. So I want to
[40:19] tie together. I want to continue with
[40:23] this subject of anointing.
[40:26] And in the first message, I brought the
[40:31] uh process of anointing and how it was
[40:34] an eastern. It was in the eastern
[40:37] culture and I I took it on the physical
[40:40] side and how the first time anointing
[40:43] really comes in God actually referred to
[40:47] Jacob anointing
[40:50] or it doesn't even say he anointed but
[40:53] he poured oil upon the pillar that he
[40:58] had slept on. And it was stone stones
[41:02] that he had made for a pillow. And it
[41:05] was at that time he had that dream and
[41:09] he saw the angels ascending and
[41:12] descending and the ladder was on earth
[41:15] but it stretched into heaven. And he had
[41:18] that dream and he was so impacted by
[41:22] that dream, so affected by that dream
[41:25] and the presence that it left him with.
[41:28] He said this is Bethl. This is the gate
[41:31] of heaven. And he called it Bethl which
[41:35] is the house of God. And he was so
[41:38] affected by that that was the first
[41:40] instance he made an altar or raised up
[41:44] those stones that he'd slept on and used
[41:47] as a pillow and he poured oil upon them.
[41:51] And then God later reminded him and God
[41:55] used the word the pillar that thou dst
[41:58] anoint and the and the vow that you made
[42:03] and he made the vow if you'll be with
[42:05] me. And so that was the first instance
[42:08] of the anointing. I just take you
[42:09] quickly through it. And then God told
[42:13] Moses then later now it's it's the a
[42:17] Abraham's children. So he told Moses,
[42:20] "Make oil and make it fragrant oil. Make
[42:25] it for anointing oil and you'll make it
[42:28] fragrant." And then later he told them,
[42:30] "Anoint the priests, the sons of Aaron."
[42:33] And then later he anoint Aaron the high
[42:37] priest and anoint the altar and anoint
[42:39] the things that are in the tabernacle.
[42:42] And it just began to ex expand in its
[42:45] understanding and meaning. And the
[42:47] people understood because they had used
[42:50] that they used that even in in in their
[42:53] daily life. I won't say daily life but
[42:55] they were acquainted with the act of
[42:57] anointing. But now it was taking a whole
[43:00] spiritual becoming very very sacred.
[43:04] And to the Hebrews they understood that
[43:08] anointing in the sacred sense when
[43:10] something was being anointed was being
[43:13] consecrated and the and the fact the
[43:16] very act of the anointing upon the
[43:19] individual especially when it was on an
[43:21] individual. their understanding was, and
[43:24] this is really fundamental to the
[43:27] message this morning as it was to the
[43:29] last two messages, but I I want to
[43:31] really nail this down is because God and
[43:36] his people, which were the Hebrews, they
[43:39] understood that when something was
[43:41] anointed in the in another realm, in the
[43:45] divine realm, they understood that
[43:47] something from God was being transferred
[43:52] from the divine one to that individual.
[43:56] And so now you want to think of this
[43:59] transferral because the message this
[44:02] morning I want to consider this
[44:05] incredible transferral that from the
[44:09] beginning in the beginning was the word.
[44:12] I want to start from the beginning or
[44:15] from the eternal one
[44:19] transferal
[44:21] from him came the word in the beginning
[44:24] was the word but in the very beginning
[44:27] there there was God alone the prophet
[44:31] describes him I'm not going to spend a
[44:32] lot of time in it but he was alone God
[44:36] by himself and from him came the logos
[44:40] or the word logos simply the Greek term
[44:44] for word. And then that word came and
[44:48] was made flesh that was transferred on
[44:52] further down. Oh, the grace that brought
[44:56] it down to man. And now it's it's a
[44:59] transferral and it came on down into man
[45:03] and from Christ into spirit form and
[45:07] from spirit form into a people. It's a
[45:11] great operation that God had in his
[45:14] mind. That is the that that's why we
[45:17] have that idea or that concept of the
[45:20] anointing. And this was the concept they
[45:22] had that when something was anointed, it
[45:25] was something all the way from the
[45:27] divine one through some process that God
[45:30] had in his mind to bring it and and
[45:33] transferring something that was actually
[45:35] divine, holy, sacred to that individual.
[45:43] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[45:45] Ignatius
[45:47] say said this.
[45:49] For there is one God who made himself
[45:53] manifest through Jesus Christ his son
[45:58] who is his logos
[46:01] proceeding from his silence
[46:04] saying Ignatius is bringing the thought
[46:07] that God was silent but now he brings
[46:11] forth a voice. He brings forth a sound
[46:15] through Jesus Christ. This process, I
[46:18] don't know if God was silent or not, but
[46:20] that is what Ignatius had said. Jesus
[46:23] said, "I've proceeded from God." And
[46:27] when he used the word proceeded, it
[46:29] isn't just that I've come forth from God
[46:32] or that I've come forth. To proceed, we
[46:35] say, well, to proceed is to make
[46:37] progress, to go forward, and to have
[46:40] motion. proceed. But when Jesus used the
[46:43] word, it was not just to say that there
[46:46] was movement, but it was to identify
[46:49] where the movement commenced. And that
[46:52] is why he said, I have proceeded and
[46:56] come forth from God.
[46:59] &gt;&gt; He identified where he he came from. I
[47:02] proceeded forth and came forth from God.
[47:06] And as the Father hath sent me, so send
[47:11] I you. We are to know emphatically where
[47:15] we came from.
[47:18] &gt;&gt; We didn't originate We didn't originate
[47:21] in our mother's womb.
[47:23] &gt;&gt; We didn't originate in our father's
[47:25] sperm. We originated in the mind of God.
[47:30] &gt;&gt; We came from God. Jesus knew that. Jesus
[47:33] never identified himself. say, "I come
[47:35] from Mary's womb.
[47:39] I come from God."
[47:42] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[47:43] &gt;&gt; It's a great plan, a great operation.
[47:46] I've come from God and I go to God. It
[47:49] is I've proceeded. I have come from one
[47:52] place to another.
[47:56] I've come down.
[47:59] I've made my appearance.
[48:02] And thus Jesus was anointed. Brother
[48:04] Brandham said in and show us the father
[48:08] in Tom's service on Wednesday night. I
[48:11] was so so very blessed and I know that
[48:14] you were as well. And he speaking on
[48:18] show us the father and it sufficeth us.
[48:21] And I thought it was just really
[48:23] marvelous how he was bringing the
[48:25] thought from it sufficeth us. It'll be
[48:28] sufficient. It's enough. That's what I
[48:30] need. And whatever our situation was,
[48:33] just to repeat a little of his words,
[48:35] whatever, whatever your situation is
[48:38] today, he used it for Wednesday, I'll
[48:40] use it for this morning. Whatever,
[48:42] wherever you're at spiritually or
[48:45] materially or physically or any other
[48:48] way, but just SHOW US THE FATHER AND
[48:51] THAT'LL be sufficient. All we need to DO
[48:53] IS SEE HIM.
[48:55] &gt;&gt; ALL YOU NEED to do, you don't need to
[48:56] see me. You don't need to see your
[48:58] friends, your peers. You don't need to
[49:00] see who you're have so much wonderful
[49:02] fellowship with in the church. You need
[49:04] to see him AND THAT'LL SUFFICE. THAT'LL
[49:07] BE SUFFICIENT.
[49:08] &gt;&gt; WE NEED TO say that's all that I really
[49:11] need. And in that message, show us the
[49:13] father. Uh brother Brandham, he said,
[49:16] let's take a little trip. He's he he's
[49:20] actually making this
[49:23] a a drama. Let's take a little trip to
[49:26] see who he was.
[49:29] And he said, "You can find out whether
[49:32] God was in his son or not. Take a little
[49:36] trip." And he goes a 100 million years
[49:38] before there was ever a star in the sky.
[49:42] There was God. And God was there then.
[49:47] And I'm I'm abbreviating some of this.
[49:49] He says, "And then the logos."
[49:52] And don't get lost when we just say that
[49:54] the word. Now he's giving the process.
[49:56] And then the logos went out from God
[50:00] which was Christ. The anointing that
[50:04] went out and I haven't been able to
[50:06] escape this for the last weeks. The
[50:09] logos, this great eternal being, the
[50:14] divine one, the God that fills all
[50:17] times, the God that's so mysterious that
[50:20] you couldn't begin to understand him. I
[50:22] couldn't begin to understand him. But he
[50:24] wants to be known. He wants to reveal
[50:27] himself. He wants to have fellowship.
[50:31] Brother Brandham said Jesus when he was
[50:32] here on earth, he only asked for one
[50:34] thing, FOR OUR FELLOWSHIP. WHY? BECAUSE
[50:37] HE CAME FORTH FROM GOD. HE PROCEEDED
[50:40] FROM GOD. HAD THE he was the attributes
[50:43] of God. He wanted fellowship
[50:47] if we could grasp that. And so he came
[50:50] forth from God. and the logos went out
[50:52] of God, which was Christ, the anointing
[50:56] that went out. So, no wonder the Jews or
[50:59] the Hebrews had that understanding that
[51:01] something was being transferred.
[51:05] I've looked into what some other
[51:06] scholars have said about the anointing
[51:10] and about the logos and about the great
[51:13] eternal one. And I can tell you that no
[51:17] one and I have I've read some things
[51:20] that make your head spin a bit. But when
[51:23] a prophet comes, he can say it in such a
[51:26] way so that you can you can actually
[51:29] grasp a hold of it. You've got something
[51:31] that you can sink your teeth into. You
[51:34] can get around it with your mind. And
[51:36] even though it may jar us a little bit,
[51:39] yet it it it captivates you. It's so
[51:42] wonderful. And so when he begins to say
[51:45] the anointing that went out and now he
[51:48] said no man he said we're standing on
[51:50] the banister watching the creation come
[51:53] into existence and see whether he was
[51:56] his son whether say he's whether he's
[51:59] his son now but now watch this
[52:02] transferal the logos the word went out
[52:06] from this great being brother Bam says
[52:08] another place perhaps a little light we
[52:10] see it it starts to circle out and it's
[52:13] the logos. It's something coming out
[52:15] from God. But now what's in the MIND OF
[52:18] GOD? BECAUSE NOW that is why the Jews
[52:20] had this this something is being
[52:23] transferred. And what's this transferal?
[52:26] Now it comes in what we have in the
[52:28] scripture in the beginning. In the
[52:30] beginning was the word. But this the
[52:32] Bible says tells us in the beginning and
[52:35] God said let there be and we find now
[52:39] that it begins to transfer the
[52:41] transferal comes into a creation and I
[52:44] don't want to go in uh spend a lot of
[52:46] time on it but he be to transfer life he
[52:50] chose and selected this planet that
[52:53] we're on.
[52:56] Oh my,
[52:59] &gt;&gt; this molten mass,
[53:03] this little speck of nothing as it were.
[53:07] The prophet calls it a clinker that
[53:10] perhaps flew off the sun. This little
[53:14] here we're sitting today and we're all
[53:17] part of what came out of the ashes, out
[53:21] of the remains. And God was making in
[53:24] his mind was making a structured person.
[53:28] He was laying out his 2x4s like a
[53:31] contractor making the uh calcium and the
[53:35] potassium and whatever more goes into
[53:38] make up our bodies that were sitting in
[53:40] here today. God had us in his mind
[53:44] billions of years ago. If there is such
[53:46] a thing, do you believe that? And now
[53:49] he's bringing it. And now he begins to
[53:51] transfer himself. He begins to transfer
[53:54] life. And the and the prophet said he he
[53:57] spoke because there were seeds down
[53:59] there. The seeds were buried. Let there
[54:02] be light because there had to be
[54:04] something that the light could re that
[54:06] the seeds could respond to. And so light
[54:10] comes. Light is born in a region that is
[54:15] that this earth can respond to. and he's
[54:18] chosen this earth and he's actually
[54:22] anointing the earth as it were because
[54:25] he's pouring out he's pouring out the
[54:27] horn of his creative power upon the
[54:32] earth this earth and then he says let
[54:35] the earth bring forth WHAT'S HE DOING
[54:38] HE'S TRANSFERRING SOMETHING THAT WENT
[54:41] OUT from himself it went out OF THE
[54:43] BOSOM OF ALMIGHTY GOD WAS THE logos it
[54:46] was the word and the word spoke. Now, I
[54:50] DOUBT IF HE SPOKE ENGLISH. I DOUBT IF HE
[54:52] SPOKE HEBREW. I don't know what he said.
[54:55] I DON'T KNOW HOW IT WAS. But it WAS AN
[54:57] UTTERANCE. LET THE EARTH BRING FORTH.
[55:00] AND THE EARTH BEGAN TO BRING FORTH.
[55:02] Something from this logos was
[55:04] transferred to THE VERY EARTH. AND OUT
[55:07] OF the earth began to grow herb and
[55:10] trees and all manner of things AND
[55:13] FLOWERS OF THE FIELD. AND IT IT IT JUST
[55:16] BLOSSOMED WITH A MASSIVE AMOUNT OF LIFE
[55:19] BECAUSE IT WAS COMING OUT OF THE BOSOM
[55:21] OF GOD.
[55:23] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen?
[55:24] &gt;&gt; AND THAT WASN'T SUFFICIENT. HE HAD MORE
[55:28] in his bosom. And so HE SAID, "LET THE
[55:31] WATERS BRING FORTH AND THE waters came
[55:34] alive." I don't care whether it took a
[55:36] million, 10 million or a hundred million
[55:38] years. Had nothing to do. I don't care
[55:40] HOW IT HAPPENED, BUT IT HAPPENED. AND
[55:43] THAT'S HOW IT HAPPENED because God said,
[55:46] "Let it bring forth." And the animal
[55:48] kingdom came forth and higher and higher
[55:51] and higher came this because God is
[55:54] transferring.
[55:56] &gt;&gt; IT'S LIKE HE'S ANOINTING THE EARTH WITH
[55:59] LIFE. HE'S TRANSFERRING UPON IT, pouring
[56:02] out the horn of his life.
[56:07] And then
[56:09] he must have his own image there. and he
[56:12] makes a man.
[56:15] Let us make man in our image.
[56:18] And when he had done that, there was no
[56:22] no one to till the ground.
[56:24] Man was made an image of God. God is a
[56:27] spirit, Jesus said. So he must make a
[56:30] man to till the ground and to care for
[56:34] the earth in the garden. And he brings
[56:37] forth and forms him
[56:41] out of the earth, out of the elements.
[56:44] And there was a body. And then the
[56:46] scripture says, "And he breathed
[56:51] into man
[56:53] into his nostrils, and man became a
[56:57] living soul."
[57:00] That is different from just spoken word.
[57:07] He spoke his word and the earth brought
[57:10] forth. He spoke his word and the waters
[57:12] brought forth. He spoke his word and all
[57:14] of the life came forth. All the levels
[57:17] of life came forth, but he never
[57:18] breathed into them.
[57:21] It was this breath that separated the
[57:25] man from all other. Even though it all
[57:28] came out of God, came out of the very
[57:31] bosom of God. He's expressing himself,
[57:34] but he breathed into him and man became
[57:37] a living soul. And Jesus when they had
[57:41] heard his word, they heard the spoken
[57:44] word AND THEY HAD THE SPOKEN WORD OF THE
[57:46] PROPHETS, BUT IT REQUIRED SOMETHING
[57:49] FURTHER.
[57:52] &gt;&gt; And he told them, "As the father hath
[57:55] sent me, as a father hath sent me, so
[57:58] send you.
[58:00] Amen.
[58:07] &gt;&gt; As I have come out of the father, as I
[58:10] have proceeded out FROM GOD, THAT'S HOW
[58:13] I AM SENDING YOU.
[58:15] &gt;&gt; I CAME FROM THE BOSOM OF GOD AND YOU ARE
[58:18] JUST AN EXTENSION
[58:20] OF THAT COMING FORTH. AND NOW I SEND YOU
[58:25] EXACTLY AS I HAVE BEEN SENT. I SEND YOU.
[58:29] I CAME OUT FROM GOD. I AM A I'VE BEEN
[58:32] TRANSFERRED FROM GOD, OUT OF GOD, OUT OF
[58:36] HIS VERY BOSOM, OUT OF HIS VERY
[58:38] ATTRIBUTES. I'VE BEEN SENT OUT. AND AS
[58:41] I'VE BEEN SENT, I SEND YOU.
[58:45] &gt;&gt; You have no more to You have no more
[58:47] right to doubt that than Jesus had to
[58:49] doubt that he came out of God.
[58:54] &gt;&gt; You have no right to doubt that.
[58:57] AND WHEN HE HAD SAID THIS,
[59:00] WHEN HE HAD SAID THIS, he breathed on
[59:04] them
[59:05] &gt;&gt; AND SAID, "RECEIVE YE THE HOLY GHOST."
[59:09] IT WASN'T SUFFICIENT EVEN TO SAY IT,
[59:11] JUST TO SAY IT. THEY KNEW THAT THEY MUST
[59:14] GO and tarry. They must go and wait. AND
[59:17] THERE WOULD BE SOMETHING THAT WOULD
[59:18] LITERALLY TAKE PLACE. AND and there was
[59:21] a rushing mighty wind and THAT FILLED
[59:25] THE WHOLE PLACE. AND THEY WERE ALL
[59:27] FILLED WITH THE HOLY GHOST. AND AT THAT
[59:30] MOMENT, THAT 120 WAS THE ONLY 120 on the
[59:34] earth that was DIFFERENT FROM ALL OTHER
[59:36] MANKIND.
[59:40] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[59:42] &gt;&gt; EVEN AS ADAM WAS DIFFERENT FROM
[59:44] EVERYTHING ELSE, FROM ALL OTHER, ALL
[59:46] OTHERS HAD LIFE, BUT THESE HAD A
[59:49] DIFFERENT KIND OF LIFE. THE TRANSFERRAL
[59:52] OF GOD HIMSELF, OF HIS OWN BREATH, OF
[59:55] HIS OWN LIFE, OF HIS OWN NATURE, OF HIS
[59:57] OWN character come into the people.
[1:00:02] &gt;&gt; AND THAT IS STILL IN FORCE TODAY. And
[1:00:05] that is what's needed amongst the
[1:00:08] BELIEVERS OF THIS MESSAGE IS THE
[1:00:11] TRANSFERRAL. NOT JUST TO HEAR A TAPE,
[1:00:14] NOT JUST TO READ A BOOK, BUT TO HAVE THE
[1:00:17] AUTHOR OF THE BOOK TO BREATHE INTO YOU
[1:00:22] the breath.
[1:00:27] And I want to tell you whatever you
[1:00:30] think of me or whatever anyone who ever
[1:00:31] hears this [sighs]
[1:00:34] service hears what I have to say and
[1:00:38] this I believe
[1:00:40] that when God
[1:00:43] when he spoke and creation came and so
[1:00:45] on then he began to speak directly to a
[1:00:48] people
[1:00:51] in the mountain. God speaking to the
[1:00:54] people and the people came to the
[1:00:57] prophet. Moses was already a prophet.
[1:01:00] They came to Moses their prophet and
[1:01:02] said,
[1:01:04] "DON'T HAVE GOD speak to us.
[1:01:08] We can't bear this.
[1:01:11] LET GOD SPEAK TO you and you speak to
[1:01:15] us." And so God agreed.
[1:01:20] He complied.
[1:01:22] And now THAT WAS THE FIRST INSTANCE. Now
[1:01:26] we have a vessel. God decreed that a
[1:01:30] vessel, a human vessel shall be his it
[1:01:34] will be his uh uh conduit is as I if I
[1:01:38] can say it that way. It will be his his
[1:01:41] his method HIS PROCESS TO CONVEY his
[1:01:45] breath
[1:01:47] &gt;&gt; FROM HIMSELF
[1:01:48] &gt;&gt; TO THE PEOPLE. And so he would have his
[1:01:53] PROPHETS, HIS SEERS.
[1:01:55] &gt;&gt; Sometimes they were called seers. And
[1:01:58] again, I refer to brother Tom's message
[1:02:00] on Wednesday. Whenever God would do
[1:02:03] something to manifest himself, a
[1:02:07] remarkable way he WOULD HAVE US SEAR TO
[1:02:09] IDENTIFY THAT changing of his mask.
[1:02:13] Amen.
[1:02:15] &gt;&gt; And when WE GRASP THE PRINCIPLE, THEN WE
[1:02:18] CAN TRANS THEN we can in our minds take
[1:02:21] that principle and move it up to the
[1:02:23] present time.
[1:02:25] &gt;&gt; GOD HE HAD TO NOW he had IS PART OF HIS
[1:02:29] PRO AND HE KNEW THAT BEFORE THE
[1:02:30] FOUNDATION OF THE world that this would
[1:02:32] TAKE PLACE AND SO NOW GOD RAISES UP
[1:02:35] PROPHETS AND THE PROPHETS BECOME HIS
[1:02:38] INSTRUMENT THROUGH WHICH HIS BREATH WILL
[1:02:41] FLOW.
[1:02:42] &gt;&gt; AMEN. IT'S NOT THROUGH THEIR MIND. IT IS
[1:02:45] SIMPLY THROUGH THEIR MOUTH. AND MOSES
[1:02:48] SPOKE ONE LANGUAGE. BROTHER BRANDHAM
[1:02:51] SPOKE ANOTHER LANGUAGE. THE MESSENGER
[1:02:53] SPOKE OTHER LANGUAGES. PAUL SPOKE
[1:02:55] ANOTHER LANGUAGE. HE SPOKE MORE THAN ONE
[1:02:58] LANGUAGE. BUT IT ALL WAS THE SAME THING.
[1:03:01] GOD TRANSFERRING
[1:03:04] &gt;&gt; WHAT WAS COMING OUT OF HIM. WHAT THE
[1:03:07] HEBREWS CALL AN ANOINTING. GOD. He in he
[1:03:11] impregnated
[1:03:13] his word with his life.
[1:03:16] &gt;&gt; YOU COULD NOT SEPARATE THE LIFE OF GOD
[1:03:19] FROM THE WORD OF GOD. YOU could say the
[1:03:21] WORD IS HIS LIFE AND THE LIFE OF HIS is
[1:03:24] his word. It's synonymous. It's one AND
[1:03:26] THE SAME. SO GOD INFUSED, HE IMPREGNATED
[1:03:31] HIS WORD WITH HIS OWN LIFE AND THEN
[1:03:34] BREATHED THAT WORD THROUGH HIS PROPHETS.
[1:03:38] IT WAS ACTUALLY THE BREATH OF GOD.
[1:03:41] &gt;&gt; SO WHEN YOU RECEIVE THAT, not just when
[1:03:43] you read it with your eyes or hear it
[1:03:46] with your physical ears, BUT WHEN YOU
[1:03:48] RECEIVE IT IN YOUR SOUL, THEN THAT LIFE,
[1:03:51] THAT'S WHY JESUS SAID THE WORD IS THE
[1:03:53] SEED. IT HAS WITHIN IT, IT HAS ALL THE
[1:03:57] COMPOUND uh uh UH ALL THE COMPOUNDS
[1:04:01] THAT'S ESSENTIAL FOR BRINGING FORTH
[1:04:04] WHATEVER THAT WORD IN ITS SEASON SAID.
[1:04:09] And that is why Jesus could take in Luke
[1:04:13] 4 and say, "The spirit of the Lord hath
[1:04:16] anointed me TO PREACH THE GOSPEL, TO
[1:04:20] HEAL THE BROKENHEARTED, TO LOOSE THE
[1:04:22] PRISONERS BECAUSE THAT WORD WAS FOR HIM,
[1:04:25] AND TO PREACH THE ACCEPTABLE YEAR OF THE
[1:04:27] LORD. THIS DAY IS THIS SCRIPTURE
[1:04:30] FULFILLED IN YOUR EARS." AND THAT
[1:04:33] PROMISED WORD WHICH WAS PROPHESIED BY
[1:04:36] MALACHI AND BY ISAIAH WAS IN HIM AND IT
[1:04:40] CAME FORTH TO LIFE IN HIM.
[1:04:45] &gt;&gt; HE RECEIVED IT.
[1:04:47] &gt;&gt; HE DID NOT RECEIVE A MESSAGE FOR A
[1:04:50] RAPTURE, taking a whole group OF PEOPLE
[1:04:54] INTO A BODY CHANGE. BUT THE PROPHET, THE
[1:04:57] PROPHET uh Paul, HE GAVE THAT PROPHETIC
[1:05:01] SEED AND GOD BREATHED OUT FROM HIM IN
[1:05:05] SEED FORM THOSE PROMISES THAT WE SHALL
[1:05:09] NOT ALL SLEEP, BUT WE SHALL ALL BE
[1:05:14] CHANGED. I ASK YOU, WHO WAS THAT FOR?
[1:05:18] WHO WAS THAT INTENDED FOR?
[1:05:21] Who who WHO WAS WHAT WHAT WAS THE
[1:05:23] PURPOSE OF GOD SPEAKING THAT? WHO'S IT
[1:05:26] FOR? AND THEN COMES A SEER, A PROPHET
[1:05:30] SEER IN THE END TIME AND SHOWS A SIGN OF
[1:05:34] THE RESURRECTION AND SAYS, "NOW IS THE
[1:05:37] TIME. THIS IS THE SEASON, MY FRIENDS.
[1:05:42] Whether I see it or not, YOU WANT TO
[1:05:44] BELIEVE THAT WITH ALL YOUR HEART. TO
[1:05:46] BELIEVE IT IS TO RECEIVE IT. TO BELIEVE
[1:05:48] IT IS TO BE THE RECIPIENT. TO DOUBT IT
[1:05:51] IS DEATH. TO DOUBT IT, YOU'LL STILL GO
[1:05:53] TO CHURCH. TO DOUBT IT, YOU MAY STILL
[1:05:55] SPEAK IN TONGUES. TO DOUBT IT, YOU STILL
[1:05:57] PLAY IN A ORCHESTRA. TO DOUBT IT, YOU
[1:05:59] CAN STILL SING SONGS THAT HAS NOTHING TO
[1:06:02] DO WITH IT. [cheering]
[1:06:03] &gt;&gt; YOU'LL MISS IT.
[1:06:05] &gt;&gt; BUT THAT WORD IS INFUSED. IT'S
[1:06:07] PREGNANTATED
[1:06:09] &gt;&gt; WITH THE rapture life.
[1:06:12] &gt;&gt; AND IT IN ITSELF ALREADY IS ANOINTED.
[1:06:20] You know, just little thoughts along the
[1:06:23] side
[1:06:26] in the Bible,
[1:06:28] God told them, "Anoint the altar, anoint
[1:06:32] it with oil." And they did.
[1:06:36] and had and because I can say the earth
[1:06:39] to me
[1:06:41] couldn't find where brother Brandham
[1:06:43] said it but in my studies
[1:06:46] the earth to me was like God's altar
[1:06:50] because here on the earth
[1:06:53] doesn't say he poured out his spirit on
[1:06:55] the sun or poured out his spirit on the
[1:06:58] moon or poured out his spirit on Pluto
[1:07:02] or Jupiter or Saturn or other galaxies.
[1:07:06] We have no record. But his spirit moved
[1:07:11] over the face of the earth. Hallelujah.
[1:07:14] Moved. And the prophet said he couped.
[1:07:18] &gt;&gt; He brooded. He cooed in love and he
[1:07:21] brooded upon the face of the earth. Why?
[1:07:23] Because he loved the water. NO. BECAUSE
[1:07:25] WHAT WAS IN THE EARTH?
[1:07:28] &gt;&gt; YOU WERE LAYING THERE.
[1:07:30] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. YOU WERE LAYING THERE.
[1:07:33] &gt;&gt; Do you believe that?
[1:07:36] And there's many that are asleep in the
[1:07:37] earth. And the same Holy Spirit is
[1:07:40] couping over this earth waiting on that
[1:07:42] promise. I'M GOING TO BRING THEM FORTH.
[1:07:46] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. I'M GOING TO BRING THEM
[1:07:47] FORTH.
[1:07:49] &gt;&gt; WE shall not all sleep. But those that
[1:07:52] are asleep in Christ shall be first
[1:07:55] raised. THEY'LL FIRST BE RAISED. DO YOU
[1:07:59] KNOW ANYBODY THAT'S GOING TO BE RAISED?
[1:08:01] ARE YOU LOOKING FOR SOMEBODY THAT'S
[1:08:02] GOING TO BE RAISED? THEY'LL FIRST BE
[1:08:04] RAISED. HALLELUJAH. AND THEN WE WHICH
[1:08:07] ARE ALIVE AND REMAIN, HERE'S THE SEED.
[1:08:10] HERE'S THE SEED. SHALL BE CHANGED
[1:08:13] &gt;&gt; IN A MOMENT, IN A TWINKLING OF AN EYE.
[1:08:17] IS THAT YOUR PROMISE?
[1:08:22] &gt;&gt; That was in seed form. And now we're in
[1:08:25] the manifestation PART OF IT. AND WE'VE
[1:08:27] RECEIVED THE SIGN, RECEIVED THE PROPHET
[1:08:29] seer
[1:08:30] who the breath of God could come
[1:08:32] through.
[1:08:36] &gt;&gt; That is why
[1:08:40] that ministry is so different.
[1:08:43] And you know the altar
[1:08:45] also had to be sprinkled with blood.
[1:08:49] And this earth
[1:08:51] as God's altar
[1:08:53] was sprinkled with blood.
[1:08:55] his own blood.
[1:08:58] He says, "I'll make it a new blood. I'll
[1:09:01] create blood again
[1:09:04] and it'll be sprinkled,
[1:09:08] spattered on the earth. I'll claim that
[1:09:11] little speck [snorts] of dust out in its
[1:09:15] orbit."
[1:09:16] Friends, this would just be some
[1:09:21] star.
[1:09:22] And even scientists that try to
[1:09:25] understand
[1:09:27] try to understand this earth they try to
[1:09:29] understand these things try to
[1:09:31] understand our place in the universe and
[1:09:34] in the in the tens of billions billions
[1:09:38] of galaxies.
[1:09:40] If you go into it you just get lost.
[1:09:45] If you go into it as a believer you're
[1:09:47] bound to say
[1:09:50] God how great thou art.
[1:09:54] You're bound to say, "How did you ever
[1:09:57] find me?
[1:10:00] &gt;&gt; How are you aware of me that God should
[1:10:03] think of me? That God should be
[1:10:06] concerned that I'm a sinner that God
[1:10:09] should be concerned about my need? THAT
[1:10:13] GOD SHOULD BE CONCERNED? I HAVE A PAIN.
[1:10:16] I have a sickness. I HAVE A DISEASE.
[1:10:18] THAT GOD SHOULD BE SO CONCERNED. I'LL
[1:10:20] COME DOWN
[1:10:22] I'LL CONDESCEND DOWN AND I'LL MAKE A WAY
[1:10:26] WHERE YOU CAN BE FREE OF YOUR GUILT,
[1:10:28] FREE OF YOUR SIN, FREE OF YOUR DISEASE,
[1:10:32] FREE OF ALL THE GRACE THAT BROUGHT IT
[1:10:34] down to man.
[1:10:38] &gt;&gt; Tell you what, friends, if I shut this
[1:10:39] service down right now and you didn't
[1:10:42] praise him, I'd say you'd be nigh unto a
[1:10:45] sinner.
[1:10:47] HOW CAN A HOW CAN A REDEEMED ONE HOLD
[1:10:50] THEIR PEACE?
[1:10:53] &gt;&gt; HOW CAN YOU FULLY UNDERSTAND WHAT HE DID
[1:10:56] AND BE AT PEACE AND BE SILENT? NO. GOD
[1:10:59] NOW HAS PUT SOMETHING IN THE PEOPLE.
[1:11:02] &gt;&gt; GOD DESIRES WORSHIP AND WE'RE HERE TO
[1:11:04] WORSHIP HIM.
[1:11:08] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[1:11:18] the concept or the understanding of the
[1:11:20] anointing
[1:11:22] even before the beginning. And that's
[1:11:24] where I've brought you from in thought.
[1:11:27] I've tried to bring you along.
[1:11:31] And then
[1:11:36] I want to just give you uh
[1:11:40] another thought if you could for a
[1:11:41] moment follow with me.
[1:11:45] You see Jesus saying I proceeded forth
[1:11:48] from God.
[1:11:53] I would like you to see him as the
[1:11:56] branch coming forth from the stalk.
[1:12:01] And the Bible says of him,
[1:12:06] Isaiah speaking, he said, "And there
[1:12:08] shall come forth a rod,"
[1:12:11] or the rod, the word in the Hebrew is
[1:12:13] actually a branch. There shall come
[1:12:15] forth a branch or another meaning is a
[1:12:17] twig
[1:12:19] out of the stem
[1:12:22] which is the trunk
[1:12:25] or the stalk of Jesse
[1:12:28] and a branch shall grow out of his
[1:12:30] roots.
[1:12:32] Jesus was like
[1:12:35] in his coming here is like a a branch of
[1:12:38] Jesse a twig coming forth. And then
[1:12:43] Jesus would say,
[1:12:45] "I am the true vine.
[1:12:48] My father's the husbandman."
[1:12:52] And if there's a true vine,
[1:12:55] something that is is very unique in
[1:12:57] Brother Brandham's ministry. And I I'm
[1:12:59] just giving this to you. I'm sewing this
[1:13:01] thought because you've run into it many,
[1:13:02] many times. And it has a great deal of
[1:13:06] meaning to me because I was when I was
[1:13:09] with brother Brandham I was really quite
[1:13:13] I was distressed I guess would be the
[1:13:15] right word at all the anointed things
[1:13:19] that I saw took place and I've made
[1:13:21] reference to them before. I heard
[1:13:23] prophecies that were not accurate did
[1:13:26] not happen and they were anointed and I
[1:13:29] couldn't understand it and great
[1:13:31] manifestations
[1:13:33] saw miracles and other things.
[1:13:37] I saw three deaf and dumb persons in a
[1:13:40] man's meeting and a small handful of
[1:13:43] people compared to brother Brandham's
[1:13:45] meetings or or Roberts's meetings or
[1:13:47] Tommy Hicks or Tommy Osbbor or any of
[1:13:50] these other men. We always think of the
[1:13:52] big tents and the biggy big auditoriums,
[1:13:54] but this was out in the field out in the
[1:13:56] open.
[1:13:58] And over a period of I think about two
[1:14:00] or three days in two small towns, both
[1:14:02] in British Columbia. I saw three deaf
[1:14:06] and dumb persons
[1:14:08] prayed for by a man I still remember his
[1:14:10] name. I won't name it just now. And he
[1:14:12] was from California, a preacher. Only
[1:14:14] saw him then, never saw him again. He He
[1:14:18] took control of that demon and cast that
[1:14:22] deaf and dumb spirit out and had that
[1:14:25] person hear and speak right there at the
[1:14:27] platform.
[1:14:30] And I was about 15. I never forgot that.
[1:14:35] Anointed?
[1:14:36] &gt;&gt; Absolutely. And was that from God?
[1:14:39] Absolutely is from God.
[1:14:42] And I wouldn't ident
[1:14:47] fine man. But with all even today you
[1:14:51] think anointed singing. We hear anointed
[1:14:53] singing and anointed preaching and
[1:14:56] anointed because Jesus said in the last
[1:14:59] days in the last days it would be so
[1:15:02] close so as to deceive the very elect if
[1:15:06] possible. it was. So, it's going to be
[1:15:09] so close and you won't find it anywhere
[1:15:11] else. You just don't find it. But now,
[1:15:14] brother Brandon brings false anointed
[1:15:16] ones and that has such a significant
[1:15:18] place in my life and my experience
[1:15:20] because I sat there on that log
[1:15:24] and had him when I raised the question
[1:15:27] and he said, "Have you heard my tape or
[1:15:30] my message on false anointed ones?" And
[1:15:33] I felt bad and I felt somewhat
[1:15:35] embarrassed that I had not heard it. I'd
[1:15:38] heard a few tapes but not many. And uh
[1:15:43] so I said no I haven't heard it. So then
[1:15:46] he went into the scriptures
[1:15:49] and in the scriptures one of the
[1:15:50] scriptures was in the last days sayith
[1:15:53] God I will pour out
[1:15:58] what is it pouring out. It's like an
[1:16:00] anointing. I will pour out my spirit
[1:16:03] upon all. And brother Brandon when he
[1:16:06] came to that he said, "I'll pour out my
[1:16:07] spirit upon." And I said, "All." I
[1:16:10] answered because you're waiting for the
[1:16:12] answer. I said, "All." And he said, "A
[1:16:14] ll flesh, but not all flesh is saved."
[1:16:19] &gt;&gt; I said, "That is correct." He said, "The
[1:16:22] wheat and the tears." You remember the
[1:16:24] parable? Yes. I said, he said, "You tell
[1:16:29] me what the wheat what caused the wheat
[1:16:31] to grow, what caused the wheat to
[1:16:34] rejoice, what caused what gave the wheat
[1:16:37] strength, and I'll tell you what the
[1:16:39] tears rejoiced in because they both had
[1:16:42] the same source." And he went through
[1:16:44] two more scriptures and then I tell you
[1:16:47] what, friends, it was like an explosion
[1:16:49] took place. And I also said to myself, I
[1:16:53] said to myself, I felt very very uh
[1:16:56] humbled because I said to myself, you
[1:16:59] have read those scriptures hundreds of
[1:17:01] times. Why haven't we why haven't I seen
[1:17:04] that before?
[1:17:05] &gt;&gt; And then I realized that the word coming
[1:17:08] in its season out of the right mouth had
[1:17:12] a different had a whole different power
[1:17:14] to it. And it was the same scripture. It
[1:17:17] just took on a whole new scope, a whole
[1:17:20] new meaning. And then when you get into
[1:17:22] false anointed ones, you'll find in
[1:17:24] several places, you'll say, "Now, he was
[1:17:27] to this brother's place, and there's a a
[1:17:31] citrus tree, an orange tree, and in
[1:17:34] there is growing lemons and grapefruit
[1:17:39] and tangelos, and several other fruits,
[1:17:42] but they're all citrus. And the branches
[1:17:45] are all growing out of this orange tree.
[1:17:48] And brother Brandham says, "Well, how is
[1:17:51] that? How can they all be manifesting
[1:17:54] these other things?"
[1:17:57] And he says, "Well, because that's what
[1:17:59] they are. That's the branch they are."
[1:18:01] Oh. He says, "So now next year,
[1:18:04] next year these will all grow oranges."
[1:18:08] He said, "Oh, no.
[1:18:10] No. The lemon branch will bring a
[1:18:12] lemon." And the tangelo will bring a
[1:18:14] tangelo and the grapefruit will bring it
[1:18:17] EVEN NEXT YEAR. YES, it'll keep on
[1:18:19] bringing that. But it's drawing life
[1:18:22] from the vine. It's drawing life from
[1:18:24] the tree. And now this whole series of
[1:18:28] messages has actually erupted from this
[1:18:30] next phrase which he makes. And whether
[1:18:33] it is that service, whether it is
[1:18:35] anointed ones, false anointed ones, but
[1:18:37] he's he makes this statement. They have
[1:18:40] the life like that. But then his
[1:18:42] statement is, "But they're bearing false
[1:18:46] witness to the tree."
[1:18:52] &gt;&gt; And that's why I said
[1:18:55] the anointing that came out from God,
[1:18:57] the purpose of that is to bring a true
[1:19:01] evidence
[1:19:03] &gt;&gt; to the tree.
[1:19:05] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:19:06] SO WHEN JESUS CAME, HE COULD SAY, "I'M
[1:19:09] THE TRUE VINE
[1:19:11] &gt;&gt; BECAUSE HE WAS BRINGING FORTH A TRUE
[1:19:13] EVIDENCE,
[1:19:15] &gt;&gt; THE ANOINTING." HE SAID, "THE SPIRIT OF
[1:19:17] THE LORD IS UPON ME BECAUSE HE HATH
[1:19:19] ANOINTED ME." HE WAS ANOINTED NOT ONLY
[1:19:22] TO BRING EVIDENCE, BUT TO BRING A TRUE
[1:19:25] EVIDENCE OF THE ORIGINAL STOCK. And my
[1:19:28] brother, my sister, YOU'RE ORDAINED. YOU
[1:19:31] ARE ORDAINED BY GOD. GOD'S PURPOSE TO
[1:19:34] BRING THIS MESSAGE IS TO LET IT COME
[1:19:36] INTO YOUR HEART AND TO ANOINT IT BY THE
[1:19:39] HOLY SPIRIT SO THAT YOU WILL BRING A
[1:19:41] TRUE EVIDENCE.
[1:19:43] &gt;&gt; A TRUE EVIDENCE. YOU'RE ANOINTED TO
[1:19:46] BRING FORTH A TRUE evidence of the
[1:19:49] original vine.
[1:19:52] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:19:54] &gt;&gt; That's why he sent THIS WORD. WE'RE NOT
[1:19:56] JUST HERE TO BE ANOTHER CHURCH. WE'RE
[1:19:58] NOT JUST HERE TO BE IDENTIFIED AS as a a
[1:20:01] some kind of a group of people. WE HAVE
[1:20:03] BEEN ORDAINED BY GOD. We're not here to
[1:20:07] BRING FORTH A BAPTIST BRANCH, a
[1:20:10] Pentecostal branch, a Catholic branch.
[1:20:13] They may ALL GET THEIR LIFE FROM THAT
[1:20:15] VINE. But there are those that come from
[1:20:18] an original twig, an original branch.
[1:20:22] AND THAT ORIGINAL BRANCH WILL ALWAYS
[1:20:24] BRING FORTH ORANGES. IT'LL BRING FORTH
[1:20:27] THE original life.
[1:20:29] &gt;&gt; How many believe that?
[1:20:33] &gt;&gt; And that branch, that life has been
[1:20:35] ordained for the rapture because I came
[1:20:38] from God AND I RETURN BACK TO GOD.
[1:20:43] &gt;&gt; You've got to believe that.
[1:20:47] &gt;&gt; You believe that?
[1:20:52] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:20:56] There shall come forth a branch.
[1:20:59] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:21:01] &gt;&gt; That's why Jesus could go on and say
[1:21:06] Jesus coming forth who was the word
[1:21:09] himself proceeded OUT FROM GOD. HE WAS
[1:21:13] THE BREATH of God.
[1:21:15] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:21:16] &gt;&gt; HE WAS NOT A PROPHET OF GOD. He was the
[1:21:20] God prophet. Prophets of God were
[1:21:24] instruments through which the breath of
[1:21:26] God COULD COME.
[1:21:28] &gt;&gt; BUT JESUS CHRIST WAS THE WORD. HE WAS
[1:21:32] THE VERY BREATH OF GOD. In him WAS LIFE.
[1:21:36] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. AND THAT LIFE WAS THE LIGHT
[1:21:38] OF MAN.
[1:21:41] &gt;&gt; BUT OTHER PROPHETS CAME AND THEY WERE
[1:21:43] INSTRUMENTS through which the breath of
[1:21:46] God came was breathed through. AND THEN
[1:21:51] THAT'S WHY BROTHER BRANDON MAKES A
[1:21:53] DISTINCTION. He says now he said when
[1:21:57] you hear that thus sayaith the lord
[1:22:00] it's not me speaking
[1:22:03] &gt;&gt; that's a different breath.
[1:22:07] Hallelujah. You follow me.
[1:22:13] You know, just to make it clear,
[1:22:20] Jesus did not say some things, for
[1:22:23] example, that brother Brandham said.
[1:22:25] Brother Brham could say, "Oh, I've just
[1:22:28] made so many mistakes."
[1:22:31] It's a man. I've made so many. You never
[1:22:33] hear Jesus saying, "I've made so many
[1:22:35] mistakes."
[1:22:36] &gt;&gt; Brother Bram said, "I was a sinner.
[1:22:39] I repented of my sins." You never hear
[1:22:42] Jesus say that.
[1:22:44] &gt;&gt; Jesus said, "My blood is drink indeed
[1:22:48] and my flesh is meat indeed." Brother
[1:22:49] Brandon couldn't say that.
[1:22:52] &gt;&gt; You understand?
[1:22:54] &gt;&gt; One was the logos himself and the other
[1:22:56] was a vessel of the logos.
[1:22:59] It's important to understand that
[1:23:01] because people go on both sides. Then
[1:23:03] some people use those maybe statements
[1:23:05] similar to mine and say, "Well, there
[1:23:07] was a difference in you only you only
[1:23:09] pay attention to what Brother Brandham
[1:23:11] said when he said, "Thus sayith the
[1:23:13] Lord." I don't accept that. I don't
[1:23:15] accept that either.
[1:23:22] I probably should, you know, people have
[1:23:24] used that. Ministers have used that
[1:23:25] sadly because they want to go toodling
[1:23:28] off on their own direction. They have
[1:23:30] their own revelation and they end off
[1:23:32] way off in some wilderness. And the sad
[1:23:34] part is I wouldn't mind if they want to
[1:23:35] go riding off there, but they take a
[1:23:38] whole group of people with them. And
[1:23:39] it's really sad saying well you know try
[1:23:42] to indicate infer that the message is
[1:23:44] unreliable. The message isn't unreliable
[1:23:46] friends. It's an absolute to us. It is
[1:23:48] the revelation of God's word to us
[1:23:51] &gt;&gt; but it'll always harmonize with the
[1:23:52] word.
[1:23:53] &gt;&gt; Always harmonize with the word.
[1:23:58] &gt;&gt; And so my desire
[1:24:00] &gt;&gt; for the congregation here, my desire for
[1:24:02] this congregation is that we will bear
[1:24:06] and I've been I've been praying for you.
[1:24:08] I hope you've been praying for me.
[1:24:10] Praying for you as a congregation,
[1:24:12] appreciating you as a congregation.
[1:24:16] And the message I've just been listening
[1:24:18] to, testimony of a true witness. Brother
[1:24:21] Benham has just lost his mother and I
[1:24:24] was with him just before that and he had
[1:24:26] the vision of the hunt and everything.
[1:24:28] And then he explained to the people in
[1:24:31] another service right after his mother
[1:24:33] departed that God gave him that hunt to
[1:24:36] comfort him in what he was going to be
[1:24:39] facing. But when he comes in November of
[1:24:41] ' 61, I believe it is, he comes and he's
[1:24:44] just lost his mother. And that is he
[1:24:46] spends so much of the service on how how
[1:24:49] what he thought of his mother and what
[1:24:51] his mother meant to him and how she was
[1:24:54] just such a he goes back into her
[1:24:57] conversations that he had with her. And
[1:25:00] then he began to thank the people, you
[1:25:02] know, and he I you can just see he
[1:25:04] becomes so melancholy and he becomes so
[1:25:07] expressive to the people. It was like
[1:25:09] he's talking to them one on- one and
[1:25:11] tells them how much he loved them and
[1:25:14] and thank you for coming and sitting
[1:25:16] with mother and thank you for being
[1:25:18] there with me and being there for our
[1:25:20] time of grief. And he goes on and on and
[1:25:23] on. It takes a long time in the service,
[1:25:26] but he's preaching on a testimony of a
[1:25:28] true witness.
[1:25:31] And I'd like to say to you, I just pray
[1:25:35] my prayer to God for this congregation
[1:25:38] is we don't have another church to be
[1:25:41] our example. We don't have any other
[1:25:44] place to be our example. Our example
[1:25:46] must be a word messagebased example and
[1:25:51] live by that. And I say, "Oh God, I
[1:25:55] wouldn't want to have labored all this
[1:25:56] 34, 35 years." And then and then end up
[1:26:01] with a say a group of people or a church
[1:26:04] not worried about you so much as worried
[1:26:07] about you know the influence that the
[1:26:09] world has and the influence of our jobs
[1:26:11] and the influence just of of the whole
[1:26:14] civilization that we're we're we're
[1:26:16] forced to live in. The influence of your
[1:26:19] schools young people. The influence of
[1:26:21] your friends. The influence of the
[1:26:24] fashion industry. The influence of the
[1:26:26] sports. the influence that is so
[1:26:29] infiltrates every part of our life. You
[1:26:32] can't even hardly move or turn around
[1:26:35] before you can feel that impact of that
[1:26:37] influence. Your neighbors and your work
[1:26:40] people that you work with and all over.
[1:26:41] I pray that God will by his divine grace
[1:26:47] allow you, my precious brothers and
[1:26:49] sisters, my precious young people, that
[1:26:52] we will when all is said and done. And
[1:26:56] you surely will stand also before him
[1:27:00] that you will hear his voice, well done.
[1:27:04] You have borne, you did bear a true
[1:27:08] evidence
[1:27:10] &gt;&gt; of the tree of life.
[1:27:13] &gt;&gt; You bore a true evidence. You were not a
[1:27:16] false witness to this tree. You were a
[1:27:18] true witness to this tree.
[1:27:25] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:27:43] The Bible says, "Then said Jesus to them
[1:27:46] again,
[1:27:48] peace be unto you,
[1:27:52] as I would like to say, exactly as
[1:27:55] precisely as the Father
[1:27:59] hath sent me. I've proceeded out from
[1:28:03] God. I've come out of the bosom of God.
[1:28:07] As he came out, so have you come out.
[1:28:13] I want to take you back not just in some
[1:28:15] mental picture, but in reality
[1:28:20] long before your greatgrandfathers and
[1:28:24] mothers and your lineage way, way back
[1:28:27] to the many, many countries that are
[1:28:29] represented here. Long before that,
[1:28:32] listen to me. You young people,
[1:28:34] especially sitting here with your mother
[1:28:36] and dad, God bless them. How we thank
[1:28:40] God for godly parents. But long before
[1:28:43] that, if you could only see, if you
[1:28:46] could only recognize it,
[1:28:50] you're believing the words of your Lord
[1:28:52] Jesus as I
[1:28:56] came from God.
[1:28:58] as I've been sent, even sent with a
[1:29:01] purpose,
[1:29:04] somebody I was just talking to
[1:29:12] in this congregation.
[1:29:15] Don't see them, but they're probably
[1:29:16] sitting here listening to me.
[1:29:19] I don't have
[1:29:21] permission to say this, but I'm going to
[1:29:23] say it. Been on my heart very, very
[1:29:24] much.
[1:29:28] I've been aware for some months
[1:29:31] God dealing with a man in this
[1:29:33] congregation
[1:29:35] very very deeply
[1:29:37] when he's out on a relaxation
[1:29:41] he's carrying his Bible
[1:29:44] and I met him on occasion when he was on
[1:29:46] a relaxation on vacation he was carrying
[1:29:49] his Bible had his Bible
[1:29:51] in the vehicle
[1:29:53] and he starts to tell me about how God
[1:29:56] is speaking to him out of his out of the
[1:29:58] scriptures. And he's weeping. He can't
[1:30:00] hold himself together. And he's weeping.
[1:30:02] I And I see now months have gone by and
[1:30:05] I've just seen a change, transformation
[1:30:10] in this man.
[1:30:18] I had a conversation with him this last
[1:30:19] week,
[1:30:24] maybe two weeks ago.
[1:30:27] and he was driven to prayer.
[1:30:31] He said, "My house is busy.
[1:30:34] Children in the house,
[1:30:37] but he said, "I found a place
[1:30:40] under the stairs
[1:30:42] and I've made a room
[1:30:45] where I can be alone
[1:30:47] with God."
[1:30:51] on another occasion. This isn't flash in
[1:30:53] the pan. This is not come up to the
[1:30:55] front and be prayed for and walk away
[1:30:56] and forget all about it.
[1:31:00] Another occasion just
[1:31:03] I'm being waked up early in the morning.
[1:31:06] I felt even sometimes in the night I
[1:31:08] just need to get out and pray and I
[1:31:11] start praying. I think I'll only pray
[1:31:13] for maybe a short time. Before I know
[1:31:16] it, it's daylight
[1:31:18] and he has to work and he has to work
[1:31:20] hard.
[1:31:22] It's gone week in, week out, week in,
[1:31:26] week out.
[1:31:30] Not long ago,
[1:31:32] in the last few weeks,
[1:31:35] he's not preaching to his wife. He's not
[1:31:37] trying to bring anything down, bring her
[1:31:40] into subjection.
[1:31:42] He just concerned
[1:31:44] told me yesterday all I want to talk
[1:31:46] about. I just want to I want to be with
[1:31:49] you. He said I just want to talk about
[1:31:51] the Lord. I just want everything you can
[1:31:53] tell me about God.
[1:31:56] And his wife is in the house and has
[1:31:58] some kind of experience and God comes
[1:32:01] upon her and speaks to her and says to
[1:32:04] her, "Jesus Christ is in your husband.
[1:32:13] I said what is happening to you? There's
[1:32:16] a purpose in that. Now you must
[1:32:21] scan
[1:32:22] as it were to know the mind of God. What
[1:32:26] are you doing this for and what is the
[1:32:28] purpose? I said there's someone else
[1:32:30] perhaps in the congregation you're to
[1:32:32] have an effect on. And I said what I'm
[1:32:34] praying I'm praying oh God let that be
[1:32:38] the experience not of one
[1:32:41] &gt;&gt; but of others.
[1:32:43] I feel like God is doing something. I've
[1:32:46] had you speak. I've had you email. I've
[1:32:49] had phone calls. And I myself know the
[1:32:52] word is different. I know that God is
[1:32:54] doing something different. I'm hearing
[1:32:56] the other brothers minister. And God is
[1:32:59] dealing with our congregation. If I was
[1:33:02] to go off the scene today, I'd want you
[1:33:04] to remember God is dealing with this
[1:33:07] congregation in a different way.
[1:33:12] &gt;&gt; You believe that?
[1:33:14] &gt;&gt; You feel it, don't you? You sense it.
[1:33:16] It's something deep within.
[1:33:19] &gt;&gt; You know what I believe it is?
[1:33:21] I believe it's the rapture word.
[1:33:25] &gt;&gt; I believe it's the anointed word for
[1:33:27] rapture.
[1:33:28] I believe that what God is doing is
[1:33:30] getting a people ready to leave.
[1:33:33] &gt;&gt; It's not just a song. It's not just a
[1:33:35] song getting ready to leave.
[1:33:38] &gt;&gt; BUT IT'S SOMETHING THAT'S TAKING PLACE
[1:33:40] THAT HAS TO DO. SO
[1:33:43] OUR EXAMPLES AREN'T OUT IN THE WORLD.
[1:33:44] IT'S NOT IN THE STREET. IT'S NOT IN THE
[1:33:46] MALL. IT'S NOT WHERE WE WORK. IT'S NOT
[1:33:49] IN THE SCHOOL. IT'S NOT IN THE COLLEGE.
[1:33:51] OUR EXAMPLE IS IN THE WORD. AND THE WORD
[1:33:54] HAS CALLED US TO SUCH A A DEPTH IN HIM.
[1:33:57] AND I BELIEVE THAT THAT WORD WHICH CAME
[1:34:00] was breathed OUT OF GOD, CREATED THE
[1:34:03] CREATION OF THIS EARTH WHEN OUR BODIES
[1:34:06] WERE STILL IN THE SOIL AND SENT HIS WORD
[1:34:09] DOWN THROUGH HIS VESSELS, THROUGH HIS
[1:34:11] PROPHETS, THE BREATH OF GOD TO THE
[1:34:14] PEOPLE IN SEED FORM.
[1:34:17] THEN IT CAME TO ITS MANIFESTED FORM AND
[1:34:21] GOD SENT A MESSENGER IN THE END TIME
[1:34:24] prophet messenger through WHOM HE COULD
[1:34:28] TRANSMIT THE VERY BREATH OF GOD.
[1:34:32] &gt;&gt; SO JESUS COULD SAY AS I HAVE BEEN SENT
[1:34:37] AS I HAVE BEEN SENT OF THE FATHER SO
[1:34:41] SEND I YOU.
[1:34:45] DOES THIS CONGREGATION UNDERSTAND WHAT'S
[1:34:47] IN MY SPIRIT AND SOUL TODAY?
[1:34:50] YOU HAVE BEEN SENT BY GOD. YOU DON'T
[1:34:52] LOOK BACK AT JUST WHERE YOU CAME FROM OR
[1:34:55] YOUR HERITAGE HERE ON EARTH. YOU'VE
[1:34:57] ISSUED OUT
[1:34:58] &gt;&gt; FROM THE BOSOM OF GOD. AND GOD knew you
[1:35:02] were going to be here. KNEW YOU WERE
[1:35:04] GOING TO SIT HERE IN THIS MEETING. KNEW
[1:35:06] YOU WERE GOING TO HEAR THIS THING. YOU
[1:35:08] CAME FROM GOD TO BE AN EXPRESSION OF GOD
[1:35:10] ON EARTH AND TO BEAR A TRUE WITNESS.
[1:35:14] OF THE VINE.
[1:35:16] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[1:35:21] &gt;&gt; Do you agree with that?
[1:35:26] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:35:29] &gt;&gt; That's what we're here for.
[1:35:33] It's an incredible time that we're
[1:35:35] living in, friends.
[1:35:37] And I pray that the spirit of God just
[1:35:39] keeps urging us on further that tomorrow
[1:35:43] will not be as yesterday and next week
[1:35:45] won't be like this week
[1:35:48] and that you'll be used of God to have
[1:35:51] such an effect and such an influence.
[1:35:55] Hallelujah.
[1:35:57] &gt;&gt; How far can we go? Who knows? There is
[1:35:59] no limits.
[1:36:02] &gt;&gt; We're birthed by God.
[1:36:05] Some here no doubt do not have that
[1:36:09] baptism. I'm not speaking about the gift
[1:36:12] now. I'm talking ABOUT THE PERSON
[1:36:13] HIMSELF
[1:36:15] &gt;&gt; COMING INTO the individual.
[1:36:18] And it's not something we, you know,
[1:36:20] it's not something that we determine
[1:36:22] within ourselves. But there's one thing
[1:36:24] that we can do and that is you can
[1:36:27] create an atmosphere. You can allow God
[1:36:30] to give a hunger IN YOUR HEART DOWN INTO
[1:36:33] YOUR SOUL, A CRAVING. IF YOU HAVEN'T GOT
[1:36:36] IT, YOU CAN, THAT'S ONE THING YOU CAN
[1:36:39] DO. YOU HAVE A VOICE. YOU HAVE SOMETHING
[1:36:42] THAT CAN EXPRESS YOUR HEART.
[1:36:44] &gt;&gt; DO YOU HAVE A REAL DESIRE FOR GOD?
[1:36:46] &gt;&gt; THEN IF I WERE YOU, I WOULD TELL HIM SO.
[1:36:49] I SAY, I HAVE SUCH A THIRST FOR YOU,
[1:36:51] SUCH A HUNGER FOR YOU. I WILL PUT MY
[1:36:53] MIND IN MY THOUGHTS. I WILL FOCUS UPON
[1:36:56] YOU. I'LL KEEP THINKING ABOUT YOU. I'LL
[1:36:59] KEEP THINKING ABOUT THE PROMISE OF THIS
[1:37:01] TIME. I WON'T LET IT GET FAR FROM ME.
[1:37:04] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[1:37:13] &gt;&gt; I'm going to close early.
[1:37:16] I want to close in this atmosphere.
[1:37:26] I look across the congregation
[1:37:29] and now when I make my next statement,
[1:37:32] make the next few comments,
[1:37:34] I do not want you to think of, you know,
[1:37:37] [clears throat] perhaps the little
[1:37:38] difficulties that you have. We all have
[1:37:41] difficulties. We all have those.
[1:37:44] We have financial difficulties. We have,
[1:37:47] you know, just life. Life life is a can
[1:37:50] be troublesome. We all have that.
[1:37:54] But I began to ask myself this last
[1:37:55] week, what is the anointing for?
[1:38:00] What is this? I can see I can see it all
[1:38:03] happen. I hope I've been I've hope I've
[1:38:04] been able to dramatize it a we bit. Do
[1:38:07] you believe it?
[1:38:08] &gt;&gt; You believe it?
[1:38:09] &gt;&gt; Believe it. Come out of the bosom of
[1:38:10] God.
[1:38:11] &gt;&gt; Here come You know, Brother Bram's
[1:38:13] trying to describe it to here comes this
[1:38:14] little light. It's the little ghost out
[1:38:17] of this great being that is so
[1:38:19] completely under indescribable cannot be
[1:38:22] understood. Here comes this little
[1:38:23] light.
[1:38:25] There comes transferring out of the
[1:38:27] bosom of God.
[1:38:30] Let there be light.
[1:38:32] Brother Bram said, "If there was a mist
[1:38:34] that came, it wasn't the word of God.
[1:38:36] Let the earth bring forth. Let the
[1:38:39] waters bring forth
[1:38:41] all the living kind and animal kingdom.
[1:38:45] Let us make man in our image." Now he
[1:38:49] begin. He's transferring himself. Now
[1:38:52] he's got one that looks like him. Just
[1:38:55] like him. My son, you be the god of the
[1:38:58] earth. Then the fall and the sin and the
[1:39:03] death and the earth that he made has
[1:39:06] been bathed in blood,
[1:39:10] cruel
[1:39:11] blood. But the scripture says the
[1:39:14] righteous blood of Abel, the blood of
[1:39:18] Jesus speaks better things than that.
[1:39:20] And then God now out of his bosom, he's
[1:39:24] got to bring the redemptive plan. He's
[1:39:26] going to redeem this back. I cannot lose
[1:39:29] it. I cannot be God and lose this. And
[1:39:32] he's got to bring the redemptive plan.
[1:39:35] And that that very low God said that
[1:39:37] went out from him sets in motion the
[1:39:40] redemption. And now he begins to act it
[1:39:43] out and play it out. And he brings his
[1:39:45] masterpiece, Christ. Christ himself was
[1:39:48] the log ghost just here for a little
[1:39:50] brief moment of time and he leaves and
[1:39:53] his spirit comes into 120 and they're
[1:39:56] birthed. They're different kind of
[1:39:59] people. They're God people.
[1:40:02] &gt;&gt; There never been people like this on the
[1:40:04] earth. They're even different from the
[1:40:05] prophets. The prophet had the word going
[1:40:08] through them. But now these were born
[1:40:12] &gt;&gt; BORN
[1:40:13] BY GOD.
[1:40:16] THEY WERE BIRTHED BY GOD
[1:40:18] &gt;&gt; AND JESUS because
[1:40:21] God himself breathed when the creation
[1:40:24] was finished. God breathed into Adam and
[1:40:28] he became a living soul. And when the
[1:40:30] new creation was finished,
[1:40:34] &gt;&gt; JESUS BREATHED ON THE DISCIPLES, RECEIVE
[1:40:37] YE THE HOLY GHOST,
[1:40:40] SHOWING THAT HE WAS THE BEGINNING OF THE
[1:40:42] NEW CREATION. BUT IN HIM IT WAS
[1:40:45] COMPLETED. IT WAS DONE. AND HE BREATHED
[1:40:48] ON THEM. Receive ye the Holy Ghost. And
[1:40:51] now these 120. And now God begins to
[1:40:55] live in a people bringing and claiming
[1:40:59] back all that was his from the very
[1:41:02] beginning. And so
[1:41:05] that breath that was breathed into us,
[1:41:09] I've received that breath.
[1:41:12] You have received that breath. If you
[1:41:15] haven't here, if you're not, if you have
[1:41:17] not received that breath,
[1:41:19] set yourself aside. Say, I I I need to
[1:41:23] receive that very breath of God.
[1:41:31] A newborn creature in Christ Jesus.
[1:41:36] That's what it's about. And friends,
[1:41:38] I'll tell you, I can go back in my life
[1:41:42] And this person I was speaking to,
[1:41:45] you're listening real close. I want to
[1:41:47] really bear it down. I said to this
[1:41:50] individual,
[1:41:52] the one thing that happened with you is
[1:41:56] it's over.
[1:41:59] There's no more struggle.
[1:42:01] &gt;&gt; No more struggle.
[1:42:04] I'm not going to say this because we're
[1:42:05] are strong people. I and my wife, we
[1:42:07] lack. We have many, many lacks. I could
[1:42:10] go on a confession time right now and
[1:42:11] confess you know that we have a lot of
[1:42:14] weaknesses
[1:42:17] and yet
[1:42:23] you know because I don't know whether
[1:42:24] it's because of the ministry what it is
[1:42:27] but my wife and I have never
[1:42:30] never been to a minister
[1:42:32] for counseling.
[1:42:35] We've never been to anyone for
[1:42:37] counseling.
[1:42:38] God has been our counsel. And I'll tell
[1:42:40] you part of that is when you settled it
[1:42:44] &gt;&gt; and you were born
[1:42:46] &gt;&gt; of the spirit of God. You got the very
[1:42:49] source within you and then it's all
[1:42:51] over. And that's what you need. That's
[1:42:53] what a person needs.
[1:42:54] &gt;&gt; My brother, my sister, I'm not opposed
[1:42:57] to I love to sit down and counsel with
[1:42:59] people to give you any kind of wisdom
[1:43:00] that I can. But I can tell you friends
[1:43:03] that we have a source.
[1:43:05] &gt;&gt; Amen. We have a source. Do you believe
[1:43:07] it? We have a source. THE ALMIGHTY GOD
[1:43:10] IS OUR SOURCE.
[1:43:13] &gt;&gt; And when you have that kind of a
[1:43:15] experience in Christ by the Holy Spirit,
[1:43:18] it's all over.
[1:43:20] &gt;&gt; It's all over. You mean we won't have a
[1:43:22] tough time. WE'LL HAVE HARD TIMES, BUT
[1:43:25] YOU'LL GO STRAIGHT THROUGH IT.
[1:43:27] &gt;&gt; YOU'LL GO STRAIGHT THROUGH IT.
[1:43:29] &gt;&gt; YOU BELIEVE THAT?
[1:43:30] &gt;&gt; YOU WILL INDEED GO STRAIGHT THROUGH IT.
[1:43:33] YOU WON'T BE UP TODAY, DOWN TOMORROW,
[1:43:35] SAVED TODAY, LOST TOMORROW. THERE'S NO
[1:43:37] SUCH A THING WITHOUT OUR GOD. WE'VE BEEN
[1:43:40] BORN BY GOD. AND WE KNOW I CAME FROM THE
[1:43:44] BOSOM OF THE FATHER.
[1:43:47] &gt;&gt; AND WHETHER YOU'RE CALLED HOME TODAY OR
[1:43:49] TOMORROW, THIS WEEK, NEXT WEEK, SOME
[1:43:51] PEOPLE JUST WANTING TO GET OUT OF THE
[1:43:53] WORLD. I WANT TO BE HERE AS LONG AS HE
[1:43:55] WANTS ME HERE. I WANT TO BE A TESTIMONY.
[1:43:57] I WANT TO BE A POWERFUL TESTIMONY. I
[1:44:00] DON'T CARE IF THIS WHOLE PACIFIC
[1:44:01] NORTHWEST THINKS WE'RE A BUNCH OF
[1:44:03] FANATICS UP HERE. I DON'T CARE WHAT IT
[1:44:05] I'M NOT GOING TO BE A FANATIC FOR THE
[1:44:07] SAKE OF BEING A FANATIC, BUT WE WANT TO
[1:44:09] BE WHAT HE WANTS US TO BE. I WANT TO
[1:44:11] BEAR A TRUE WITNESS TO THE VINE.
[1:44:18] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[1:44:22] &gt;&gt; And this is what it says. I'm closing in
[1:44:24] just a couple minutes.
[1:44:27] And it shall come to pass in that day,
[1:44:29] Isaiah said, that his burden shall be
[1:44:33] taken away from off thy shoulder,
[1:44:36] and his yoke from off thy neck, and the
[1:44:39] yoke shall be destroyed
[1:44:42] because of the anointing.
[1:44:46] &gt;&gt; One thing the anointing will do,
[1:44:49] &gt;&gt; you may have some yoke. You may have
[1:44:52] something that has pressed you down. You
[1:44:55] may have something that Satan has used
[1:44:57] against you. I will announce to you
[1:45:00] today unequivocally and without any
[1:45:02] apology. The word that has come has the
[1:45:06] POWER TO BREAK THAT YOKE.
[1:45:09] &gt;&gt; IT IS THE ANOINTING. IT IS THE BREATH OF
[1:45:12] GOD. IT'S THE VERY BREATH OF GOD. WE
[1:45:15] HAVE MAYBE PERSONAL THINGS IN OUR LIVES
[1:45:17] AND SAY, "OH GOD, OH GOD, WHERE'S THE
[1:45:19] DELIVERANCE FOR IT?" THE DELIVERANCE IS
[1:45:21] RIGHT HERE. IT DOESN'T HAVE TO BE SOME
[1:45:23] SPECIAL, YOU KNOW, EMOTIONAL THING THAT
[1:45:25] YOU HAVE. YOU'VE JUST GOT TO BELIEVE IT.
[1:45:27] TO DISBELIEVE IT IS TO CARRY YOUR YOKE
[1:45:30] ON. YOU'LL CONTINUE ON WITH THE YOKE ON
[1:45:33] YOU. BUT IF YOU BELIEVE IT, THE YOKE,
[1:45:35] THE ANOINTING WILL BREAK THE YOKE.
[1:45:42] &gt;&gt; Does somebody need it?
[1:45:44] &gt;&gt; I'm here to do business with God.
[1:45:47] You want that yoke broken, you can stand
[1:45:50] to your feet and God will break that
[1:45:52] yoke at this moment. Don't be ashamed
[1:45:55] and don't be don't be embarrassed.
[1:45:58] That's what they came for, to break that
[1:46:00] yoke. YOU BELIEVE THE WORD. YOU BELIEVE
[1:46:03] THE WORD AND THE ANOINTING WILL BREAK
[1:46:05] THE YOKE. YOU'VE RECEIVED AN ANOINTED
[1:46:08] WORD.
[1:46:11] Now
[1:46:14] you pray.
[1:46:16] You pray.
[1:46:18] You call on them. Forget who's beside
[1:46:20] you. WHETHER IT'S YOUR WIFE OR HUSBAND
[1:46:22] OR WHO IT IS, YOU PRAY.
[1:46:24] &gt;&gt; BREAK THAT YOKE IN THE NAME OF JESUS
[1:46:27] CHRIST. I HAVE RECEIVED THE WORD. I HAVE
[1:46:31] RECEIVED THE PROMISED WORD. I HAVE
[1:46:34] RECEIVED THE BREATH OF THE ALMIGHTY GOD
[1:46:39] &gt;&gt; in the name of Jesus Christ.
[1:46:42] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:46:45] Receive it now.
[1:46:47] &gt;&gt; Receive it now.
[1:46:49] &gt;&gt; Let that yoke be broken.
[1:46:51] &gt;&gt; I can TELL YOU FRIENDS, SATAN is
[1:46:53] fighting his hardest right now. You deny
[1:46:56] him. DON'T YOU LET HIM LIE TO YOU. Don't
[1:46:59] you let him SAY IT'S GOING TO BE THE
[1:47:01] SAME. YOU SAY IT'S GOING TO BE
[1:47:03] DIFFERENT. IT'S GOING TO BE DIFFERENT.
[1:47:05] THAT YOKE IS BROKEN. THE ANOINTING WHICH
[1:47:07] I'VE RECEIVED BREAKS THAT YOKE.
[1:47:17] going to pray with you.
[1:47:21] &gt;&gt; Father, I know.
[1:47:24] &gt;&gt; You will not deny this people.
[1:47:28] &gt;&gt; You will not deny your word.
[1:47:32] You will deny Satan any opportunity for
[1:47:34] victory here this morning.
[1:47:37] &gt;&gt; You'll deny the powers of darkness.
[1:47:40] Oh, how he wants to fight. Oh, how he
[1:47:44] wants to resist. Oh, he wants to
[1:47:46] procrastinate.
[1:47:48] AND OUR LORD JESUS, YOU IDENTIFIED HIM.
[1:47:51] YOU SAID HE'S A LIAR FROM THE BEGINNING.
[1:47:55] SATAN, you are a liar. And we are not
[1:47:58] influenced by your lies. We're not
[1:48:01] influenced BY YOUR PRESENCE. WE'RE NOT
[1:48:03] INFLUENCED BY YOUR RESISTANCE. IN THE
[1:48:06] NAME OF JESUS, WE DECLARE your head has
[1:48:10] been crushed. YOUR REASONING WE DO NOT
[1:48:13] ACCEPT. YOUR LIES OUR EARS ARE CLOSED
[1:48:17] TO. WE HAVE ACCEPTED THE WORD of the
[1:48:20] Lord.
[1:48:22] &gt;&gt; And by that word,
[1:48:24] we have RECEIVED WHAT WE HAVE COME FOR.
[1:48:28] LORD, we believe that we have proceeded
[1:48:30] from God. We believe as the father sent
[1:48:33] you [music] and you said so send I you.
[1:48:39] WE'VE BEEN SENT INTO THIS EARTH AT THIS
[1:48:42] SEASON. WE WERE SENT TO HEAR WHAT we
[1:48:46] have heard. We've been SENT TO BE BORN
[1:48:49] IN THE homes we were born in. We've been
[1:48:52] sent to be gathered together in this
[1:48:55] company of people. And Lord, let the
[1:48:58] individuals that are in this
[1:48:59] congregation this morning know, register
[1:49:01] it IN THEIR HEARTS. THEY'VE BEEN SENT TO
[1:49:04] HEAR THIS MESSAGE THIS MORNING. LET THEM
[1:49:08] KNOW THAT THE HOLY SPIRIT HAS BEEN SENT
[1:49:11] TO FILL THEM. LET THEM KNOW THAT THE
[1:49:14] HOLY SPIRIT HAS SENT TO BREAK EVERY
[1:49:16] BONDAGE in the name of Jesus Christ.
[1:49:19] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:49:22] And I would pray Lord that you would go
[1:49:23] even beyond the walls of this building.
[1:49:28] Go out into the utter other parts of the
[1:49:30] world Lord where the hearers are
[1:49:32] listening and where they are praying and
[1:49:36] where they are standing at this moment.
[1:49:38] Make them fill that room I pray.
[1:49:42] Father go beyond
[1:49:45] into the regions of the darkness.
[1:49:48] Oh shepherd, there are lost ones that we
[1:49:52] are praying for. They're bound. They're
[1:49:56] bound with chains and feathers. Oh God,
[1:49:59] WE SEND NOW OUR PRAYER. Send your
[1:50:03] presence to them. SEND YOUR PRESENCE. Oh
[1:50:06] God, SEND YOUR PRESENCE. BREAK THE YOKE.
[1:50:10] BREAK THE YOKE OF SIN. BREAK THE YOKE of
[1:50:12] evil habits. BREAK THE YOKE OF SATAN
[1:50:16] UPON THEIR lives in the name of Jesus.
[1:50:21] &gt;&gt; Let their lips begin to speak
[1:50:25] &gt;&gt; things of truth.
[1:50:28] Let their heart be opened and let the
[1:50:32] son of righteousness shine in
[1:50:35] the name of Jesus Christ
[1:50:38] for your glory.
[1:50:41] &gt;&gt; For your glory.
[1:50:43] for your glory. We give you all the
[1:50:46] praise and the glory.
[1:50:48] &gt;&gt; Oh, we give you all the praise and the
[1:50:50] glory.
[1:50:52] &gt;&gt; I believe it would be appropriate for us
[1:50:54] to thank him to enter into worship to
[1:50:58] his
[1:50:59] in his august presence.
[1:51:03] &gt;&gt; Oh God,
[1:51:06] I so thank you. Thank you for the
[1:51:08] testimony I was able to give. Thank you
[1:51:11] for what you're doing, Lord, in the
[1:51:12] homes, in the families, in the hearts.
[1:51:15] Thank you for what you're doing, oh God.
[1:51:17] Oh God, continue, Father. Continue.
[1:51:21] Continue. I pray
[1:51:23] these that are have stood and saw. Lord,
[1:51:28] I saw them stand him instantly.
[1:51:31] meet my brother, I pray, oh God, that
[1:51:36] let him know that he shall go out of
[1:51:38] this place having received what he came
[1:51:41] in for. What caused him to rise
[1:51:45] so quickly?
[1:51:48] Let him receive that answer for every
[1:51:50] person. Every person. I pray for them
[1:51:53] now in the name of Jesus Christ. I
[1:51:58] wonder if you're standing by someone
[1:52:00] who's standing,
[1:52:01] why don't you lay your hand on them?
[1:52:05] Just lay your hand upon their shoulder.
[1:52:09] Say, "Oh God,
[1:52:11] I do this." This example was also given
[1:52:14] to us by our messenger. I pray for this
[1:52:17] one. I pray, oh God, that the very thing
[1:52:22] that they have stood for will now be
[1:52:26] banished. Oh God, the very thing that
[1:52:29] they've stood for will be answered in
[1:52:33] the name OF JESUS CHRIST. LET THE church
[1:52:35] of the living God enter into their
[1:52:38] inheritance
[1:52:39] and receive the full benefit
[1:52:44] in Jesus name.
[1:52:46] In Jesus name. Hallelujah.
[1:52:50] Let deaf ears be opened. Let our minds
[1:52:54] be enlightened.
[1:52:59] Hallelujah.
[1:53:02] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:53:10] &gt;&gt; Praise God. Praise God.
[1:53:13] Praise God.
[1:53:17] Every
[1:53:20] fetter
[1:53:23] Jesus break
[1:53:32] &gt;&gt; every feather and he [music] sets
[1:53:38] me
[1:53:40] free. [singing]
[1:53:42] &gt;&gt; I will shout hallelujah. [music]
[1:53:49] &gt;&gt; [singing]
[1:53:50] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:53:52] [music]
[1:53:54] I will shout.
[1:53:58] [music and singing]
[1:54:04] Hallelujah.
[1:54:08] Hallelujah. [singing]
[1:54:14] &gt;&gt; For he set
[1:54:18] me
[1:54:20] free. [music and singing]
[1:54:22] &gt;&gt; Jesus breaks every feather.
[1:54:25] &gt;&gt; Jesus breaks
[1:54:27] &gt;&gt; every
[1:54:29] every [music]
[1:54:34] Jesus praise
[1:54:38] [music]
[1:54:41] heaven.
[1:54:44] Jesus [music]
[1:54:46] praise
[1:54:51] [music]
[1:54:54] and he set [music]
[1:54:58] me
[1:55:01] free. Could
[1:55:05] I ask our brother Mike G if you'll come
[1:55:06] here please? Brother Mike.
[1:55:18] Are you born again?
[1:55:22] &gt;&gt; That's good. Are you born again? Amen.
[1:55:25] &gt;&gt; The very breath of God produced that.
[1:55:30] &gt;&gt; Wasn't the breath of a preacher. It's
[1:55:33] the breath of God
[1:55:34] &gt;&gt; produced that.
[1:55:37] &gt;&gt; It's something to be born of God.
[1:55:40] &gt;&gt; And it's something to know that you've
[1:55:42] come.
[1:55:44] I want you to go out of this place today
[1:55:46] saying that great
[1:55:50] our father
[1:55:54] Father, I I was in your bosom.
[1:55:59] &gt;&gt; I was some there with a host of people.
[1:56:02] I was in your bosom.
[1:56:05] &gt;&gt; And then out from there I came.
[1:56:09] &gt;&gt; I'm in a little short journey
[1:56:12] and I'm on my way back.
[1:56:15] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:56:18] &gt;&gt; Oh, that can just be a revelation to
[1:56:21] you. I came out of the bosom of Almighty
[1:56:25] God. I'm here on a little SHORT JOURNEY
[1:56:28] AND I'M ON MY WAY BACK.
[1:56:34] &gt;&gt; Let's thank him.
[1:56:35] &gt;&gt; I'm on my way back.
[1:56:37] &gt;&gt; To the bosom of God.
[1:56:45] NOT DEATH,
[1:56:47] &gt;&gt; NOT THE GRAVE,
[1:56:50] &gt;&gt; nothing can overcome that.
[1:56:53] &gt;&gt; Well, that's what we have to know.
[1:57:04] &gt;&gt; I want you to early early this morning
[1:57:07] in the wee hours, I was going over this
[1:57:10] song and I said to her, [music] I want
[1:57:12] to sing it. I thought it was in the song
[1:57:13] book. My wife said, "No, that's a song
[1:57:15] that Brother Mike sang." So that's how
[1:57:18] it impressed me, Brother Mike. And so I
[1:57:21] want want you just to help take a
[1:57:22] microphone, would you? And we want to
[1:57:26] You know which one it is? Yeah.
[1:57:34] I don't know what parts. I can tell you
[1:57:36] the parts that really were already. Who
[1:57:39] is worthy?
[1:57:41] Four and 20 elders and four living
[1:57:43] creatures. 10,000 times thousands. Here
[1:57:47] we are.
[1:57:49] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:57:51] &gt;&gt; Singing around the throne.
[1:57:54] &gt;&gt; Glory,
[1:57:56] friends. We don't have this opportunity
[1:57:59] down the street or when we're out.
[1:58:00] You're going to go and have a bite to
[1:58:02] eat. You won't have this opportunity in
[1:58:04] the restaurant. TAKE ADVANTAGE OF IT NOW
[1:58:07] AND HERE. ENJOY THIS ATMOSPHERE.
[1:58:11] AMEN.
[1:58:12] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. You won't scare me.
[1:58:15] &gt;&gt; You won't scare your neighbor.
[1:58:19] &gt;&gt; You believe it's over. The yoke is
[1:58:22] broken. Death is conquered. Jesus is
[1:58:25] alive. And he's here.
[1:58:30] &gt;&gt; Absolutely.
[1:58:41] Listen friends,
[1:58:43] I see we all have our coats and our
[1:58:45] clothing intact.
[1:58:48] before he died, before he raised,
[1:58:52] before he showed himself alive, THEY'RE
[1:58:56] TAKING OFF THEIR COATS, throwing it on
[1:58:58] the ground,
[1:59:00] spreading it so the donkey could run
[1:59:02] over it, WAVING HOSANA, HOSANA. SAID,
[1:59:06] TELL THEM TO KEEP QUIET. IF THEY KEEP
[1:59:09] STILL, THE STONES will cry out.
[1:59:12] [cheering]
[1:59:15] He didn't say the stones will whisper.
[1:59:21] &gt;&gt; SOME SOMEBODY SAYS GOD ISN'T DEAF AND
[1:59:24] YOU CAN'T MAKE HIM DEAF EITHER.
[1:59:27] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[1:59:28] &gt;&gt; I believe heaven is full of noise,
[1:59:31] rejoicing,
[1:59:33] singing, music.
[1:59:39] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:59:45] Let's worship.

[2:00:06] &gt;&gt; Where's the words? The answer comes
[2:00:10] back. [music and singing]
[2:00:12] No one's worthy.
[2:00:16] Oh, through heaven
[2:00:18] and earth
[2:00:21] we look.
[2:00:25] No apostle
[2:00:27] or prophet
[2:00:30] or priest
[2:00:32] or king
[2:00:34] even on [singing]
[2:00:36] these pages.

[2:04:40] [music]
[2:04:47] [applause]
[2:04:57] &gt;&gt; The lion of the tribe of Judah.
[2:05:01] I think Satan thought he almost had it
[2:05:04] &gt;&gt; when Judah wouldn't give
[2:05:08] &gt;&gt; his last son to Tamar.
[2:05:13] And the ancient Nyian father said that
[2:05:17] Tamar, SHE SCOFFED AS IT WERE at the
[2:05:21] burning.
[2:05:23] SHE HAD NO THOUGHT
[2:05:25] ABOUT BEING STONED. SHE CARED nothing
[2:05:28] about that. she must bring forth. It was
[2:05:31] Christ
[2:05:34] &gt;&gt; prevailed.
[2:05:36] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[2:05:37] &gt;&gt; THE TRIBE, THE LION OF THE TRIBE OF
[2:05:39] JUDAH PREVAILED.
[2:05:41] &gt;&gt; And then ALL OF THE PROPHETS ALL DOWN
[2:05:43] THROUGH THE AGES EVEN THOUGH IT SEEMED
[2:05:45] AS THOUGH
[2:05:47] THERE WAS PARTIAL VICTORIES AND THE
[2:05:50] PEOPLE go into bondage AND GO INTO
[2:05:51] SLAVERY AND GOD'S PEOPLE LIKE ALMOST
[2:05:54] EXTINGUISHED IN EGYPT. But the lion of
[2:05:57] the tribe of Judah prevailed and the
[2:06:01] lineage kept coming on down.
[2:06:04] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:06:07] &gt;&gt; And the people kept, you know, THINKING
[2:06:09] ABOUT THIS GOD AND EVERY PROPHET DIED
[2:06:12] and they died and they died.
[2:06:15] No one had the key to come out. But
[2:06:18] finally, one
[2:06:20] &gt;&gt; entered into a new tomb and he had the
[2:06:24] key to come out. He was the anointed
[2:06:26] one. WHAT BROUGHT HIM OUT? THE WORD.
[2:06:30] &gt;&gt; THE WORD TOOK HIM IN AND THE WORD
[2:06:32] BROUGHT HIM OUT. The anointed word.
[2:06:34] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:06:38] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[2:06:40] &gt;&gt; For the lion
[2:06:43] of the tribe
[2:06:46] of Judah [music and singing]
[2:06:50] has prevailed.
[2:06:53] Praise [music]
[2:06:55] &gt;&gt; God and lifted up to much more.
[2:07:02] [music and singing]
[2:07:09] [music]
[2:07:15] [singing]
[2:07:17] Dear heavenly father,
[2:07:22] so many times I do not even feel worthy
[2:07:25] to call upon you, [music]
[2:07:28] but you have made us accepted in the
[2:07:31] beloved.
[2:07:33] And today
[2:07:35] I can say within the hearing of these
[2:07:39] people,
[2:07:41] we have a sacrifice that's been found
[2:07:43] perfect. Our Lord Jesus Christ was
[2:07:47] examined.
[2:07:49] And through this next week that we are
[2:07:51] having as a memorial and remembrance,
[2:07:54] he was held up and examined
[2:07:57] and he was found perfect.
[2:08:01] It wasn't only Pilate who could say, "I
[2:08:03] find no fault in this man."
[2:08:06] But you looked upon him.
[2:08:09] YOU WERE SATISFIED WITH the sacrifice.
[2:08:13] You were pleased with the sacrifice
[2:08:16] and sin's grip was broken over the face
[2:08:21] of the earth and man could come now to
[2:08:24] full redemption. And here we are
[2:08:26] standing today at the end of the ages as
[2:08:30] it were
[2:08:32] almost
[2:08:33] feeling like we're on the balcony
[2:08:37] looking into eternity
[2:08:39] standing here in time but we're leaning
[2:08:43] forward. We're looking over the
[2:08:45] banisters at where and we see a great
[2:08:48] eternal horizon that is risen Lord. We
[2:08:52] hear marvelous words that come to us
[2:08:56] through the prophetic voice that you
[2:08:58] sent. We hear descriptions of you, oh
[2:09:01] God,
[2:09:03] that no one seems to be able to to say
[2:09:06] it like that. AND WE HEAR GLORIOUS
[2:09:09] things about your bride. Lord, we
[2:09:12] identify ourselves with that those
[2:09:15] descriptions.
[2:09:17] I pray that you will go with these
[2:09:20] people and I ask, oh God, if there's any
[2:09:25] person that yet has been untouched
[2:09:28] and do not feel that moving within them,
[2:09:33] I ask Lord that you will
[2:09:36] deal with them in such a way. Move close
[2:09:39] to them, Lord.
[2:09:41] make yourself so
[2:09:44] present with them and set up a hunger
[2:09:46] and a desire within their heart. Lord, I
[2:09:50] pray
[2:09:52] I pray that there will be a great great
[2:09:55] transformation.
[2:09:57] Some here need it more than others.
[2:09:59] Lord, I just pray they'll identify it
[2:10:02] where that's [music] why we preach.
[2:10:04] That's why I preach this morning. Lord,
[2:10:06] I've done what I could do. Now take it I
[2:10:09] pray and do the supernatural with it I
[2:10:12] ask in the name of Jesus Christ dismiss
[2:10:16] us now Lord with your grace
[2:10:20] your blessings I pray. Amen.
[2:10:24] Amen.
[2:10:26] God bless you name of our Lord Jesus
[2:10:29] Christ. Lord willing, we'll see you this
[2:10:31] evening and our brother Lance Laroo as
[2:10:34] we're preparing,
[2:10:36] waiting on God for the service tonight.
[2:10:38] [music]
[2:10:39] You will enjoy it. Amen. God bless you.
[2:10:43] You're dismissed in Jesus name.
[2:12:38] My
[2:13:03] Lord, you walk away.
[2:13:06] Jesus
[2:13:21] name
[2:13:26] everyit.
