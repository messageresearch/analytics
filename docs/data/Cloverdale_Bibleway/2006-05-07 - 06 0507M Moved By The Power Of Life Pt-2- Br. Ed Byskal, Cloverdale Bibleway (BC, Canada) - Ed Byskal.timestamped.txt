[12:12] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[12:12] &gt;&gt; having a high priest to just go in once
[12:14] a year.

[12:19] off the scene. But Lord, not because you
[12:22] did not want to communicate with us, but
[12:25] because you wanted a one-on-one
[12:27] relationship.

[12:31] morning as you have so freely given it.

[13:42] to come and open the service in a word
[13:44] of prayer this morning.
[13:47] We've got a testimony from Sister Renee
[13:49] AO. Wednesday night on the way home from
[13:52] church, a sharp pain started to develop
[13:54] in the right side of my chest. It got so
[13:57] bad I couldn't breathe normally and I
[13:59] could only sleep lying on my back. My
[14:02] husband Mark, my son Billy, prayed for
[14:06] me. And the testimony is that the pain
[14:09] left.
[14:11] Amen.
[14:13] &gt;&gt; We want to give the Lord thanks for that
[14:14] this morning.
[14:17] We want to remember to pray for brother
[14:20] assistant or I'm sorry, brother Chris
[14:22] and sister Tabitha Hall from Johnson
[14:26] City, Tennessee as their son Jonah has
[14:28] burned himself badly this morning and is
[14:31] in the hospital. So we want to remember
[14:34] that little one this morning.
[14:38] Brother Ernie wants us to remember the
[14:39] meetings in Sacramento that'll be taking
[14:41] place in the coming week. The Lord would
[14:44] have his way there as well. If you have
[14:46] a need upon your heart, would desire
[14:48] that the Lord would meet you.
[14:51] Ask
[14:53] and believe and it shall be even as you
[14:56] say. God bless you, brother DD.

[35:15] &gt;&gt; That is our desire.
[35:19] &gt;&gt; Fathers, we bow before you.
[35:22] Prayers have been offered.
[35:26] Songs have been sung.
[35:28] We have come into your courts with
[35:30] praise and worship, adoration.
[35:34] for there's none worthy but you.
[35:37] We are here to give you praise.
[35:39] &gt;&gt; Amen. And we pray you'll receive the
[35:42] fruit of our lips.
[35:44] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[35:45] &gt;&gt; And the acts of our lives.
[35:48] &gt;&gt; And dear Lord, now as we are about to
[35:51] open your word, truly no one but the
[35:55] Holy Ghost can interpret and make known
[35:58] this word. reveal to those to whom it's
[36:02] not been revealed as yet. I pray you'll
[36:06] quicken it to those that it has been
[36:09] revealed to.
[36:10] &gt;&gt; And may it be renewed once again. And
[36:13] may the life of it, oh God, be vibrant.
[36:17] May the first love be a flame in the
[36:21] bosom of every believer, oh God. I pray
[36:25] for all that are under the sound of my
[36:27] voice today, Lord. And that voice will
[36:31] do nothing except that you shall be the
[36:34] speaker. I pray, Father, by the Holy
[36:37] Spirit, the same spirit that came upon
[36:41] the 120 on the day of Pentecost and
[36:45] continued on through the New Testament
[36:48] era. Be present with us this morning. Oh
[36:51] Lord, we're depending on you. We're
[36:53] depending on you. We do not depend on
[36:56] the arm of flesh. We're depending
[36:59] entirely upon you. Bless now the people
[37:03] and I as I stand here at the post of
[37:05] duty. I pray that your uncction, oh God,
[37:10] will be our portion and anoint your word
[37:13] now to our hearts. Lord, I pray that
[37:17] every need, spiritual need that is that
[37:20] is essential and that is here this
[37:24] morning, feed the flock, oh great
[37:28] shepherd is our desire in Jesus Christ's
[37:32] name. Amen.
[37:35] God bless you. Nice to see you all this
[37:38] grand day in the presence of God. Amen.
[37:42] Isn't he wonderful? He's been doing good
[37:45] things for us.
[37:47] &gt;&gt; For whereof we are glad.
[37:49] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[37:51] I'm going to have you turn directly to
[37:53] the scripture if you would please to our
[37:57] text of Wednesday night. It's second
[37:59] Peter the first chapter. We'll read
[38:04] fewer verses. We started from verse 15
[38:08] on Wednesday.
[38:11] I'm going to begin at verse 19
[38:16] and later on we will go back to these
[38:19] scriptures. I have some uh PowerPoint
[38:22] slides I would like to refer to in a in
[38:25] a few moments but we'll just read this
[38:28] scripture.
[38:32] We have also a four um more sure word of
[38:35] prophecy
[38:37] where unto you do well that you take
[38:39] heed as unto a light that shineth in a
[38:41] dark place
[38:44] until the day dawn and the day star
[38:47] arise in your hearts.
[38:50] Knowing this first that no prophecy of
[38:52] the scripture is of any private
[38:54] interpretation.
[38:57] For the prophecy came not in old time by
[39:00] the will of man, but holy men of God
[39:03] spake as they were moved by the Holy
[39:06] Ghost.
[39:08] And I think also we'll read first Peter.
[39:13] I referred to the scripture also on
[39:15] Wednesday, first scripture, 1 Peter the
[39:17] first chapter
[39:20] and verse 10 and 11.
[39:24] of which salvation the prophets have
[39:27] inquired and searched diligently,
[39:30] who prophesied of the grace that should
[39:32] come unto you, searching what or what
[39:35] manner of time the spirit of Christ
[39:39] which was in them did signify when it
[39:43] testified beforehand the sufferings of
[39:46] Christ and the glory that should follow.
[39:49] Amen. You may be seated.
[39:58] The Bible has many words that uh speak
[40:01] of being moved.
[40:04] Uh it speaks of being moved by
[40:08] afflictions,
[40:11] being moved with compassion. It's not
[40:14] the same word, a different word each
[40:16] time.
[40:18] being moved
[40:20] by uh some wind or something that would
[40:23] shake a person. they're being moved or
[40:27] being moved as it was when the chief
[40:30] priests moved the people to they
[40:33] motivated the people and we spoke a a
[40:36] good deal about that on on Wednesday and
[40:39] I would like to also bring that in if I
[40:41] may being moved by in by indignation
[40:47] those all different words but it's not
[40:51] the same as being moved by the Holy
[40:55] Ghost
[40:56] &gt;&gt; as a completely different word and it
[40:58] has a completely different connotation.
[41:01] And so I'll just have them uh put slide
[41:05] one up. If you would please
[41:09] uh which is the scripture which we have
[41:11] just read. For the prophecy came not in
[41:16] old time
[41:18] by the will of man, but holy men of God
[41:24] spake as they were moved by the Holy
[41:27] Ghost. Now while you're holding that
[41:29] scripture in front of you,
[41:31] remember the second scripture which we
[41:34] uh quoted
[41:37] in fact is it is I think uh
[41:43] it's the fourth fourth slide. We'll just
[41:46] bring it up as well. Of which salvation
[41:49] the prophets have inquired and searched
[41:52] diligently. Now we have the men who who
[41:55] spoke it
[41:57] searching diligently
[42:00] who pro these prophesied of the grace
[42:02] that should come and what they were
[42:05] searching for. They were searching what
[42:08] or what manner of time that the spirit
[42:11] of Christ which was in them.
[42:15] The spirit of Christ was in them and it
[42:18] was signifying it was testifying. It was
[42:21] speaking of the glories that should come
[42:24] and they they knew it. They could feel
[42:26] it, but they couldn't quite identify it.
[42:29] They didn't, you know, they they they
[42:32] couldn't define it. They just knew that
[42:34] it was there. It was laying there, but
[42:37] it was sealed up from them and yet it
[42:40] was such a reality. You know, I believe
[42:42] that believers believers are that way.
[42:45] We'll go back now to to the second slide
[42:49] two, please. So it says that they were
[42:52] moved by the Holy Ghost and now this
[42:56] movement because it relates directly to
[42:58] us. If we have received the word which
[43:02] we have and the revelation of the word
[43:06] which we speak about. This is not being
[43:09] moved is being shaken or being moved is
[43:13] being convinced or being moved by just a
[43:16] compassion. This is a different kind.
[43:19] There's a completely different
[43:21] connotation here that this is this is
[43:23] what the uh prophets of old what they
[43:27] experienced. They were being moved by a
[43:30] a a the spirit of God. And that spirit
[43:33] of God was a it it brought a burden to
[43:37] them. It it brought a burden to know
[43:40] that you know when you want to inquire
[43:41] about something when you don't know and
[43:44] you want to know and you intensely want
[43:46] to know it becomes a it becomes a burden
[43:49] to you. It becomes it's something that
[43:52] occupies your mind. You wake up with it
[43:55] in the morning. I need to know that I
[43:57] need especially when it was from the
[43:59] spirit of God. They just knew there was
[44:02] something out there. They just had to
[44:04] they were searching for it in the
[44:06] morning. They were searching throughout
[44:07] throughout one day to the next. It
[44:09] didn't make any difference. Although
[44:11] they may had a they they had to live,
[44:13] they had to eat, they had to work, they
[44:15] had responsibilities, but there was one
[44:17] thing that was occupying them. What is
[44:19] this wondrous thing that that God is
[44:22] witnessing, signifying within me? It's a
[44:25] reality. Is it for me? Is it for this
[44:28] time? Or what manner of time is it? But
[44:30] I need to really know. And God held it
[44:33] from them, but they never stopped
[44:34] wanting to know.
[44:38] And so it is a burden. The Bible speaks
[44:41] through Zachchariah the burden of the
[44:44] word of the Lord. The Bible speaks
[44:47] Malachi prophesied and he and he begins
[44:50] it. The burden of the word of the Lord.
[44:53] You see the word of the Lord which we
[44:55] receive does not come uh without a
[44:58] weight. There's a there's a
[44:59] responsibility to it to begin with. We
[45:02] become a responsible people when we
[45:04] receive the word of the Lord. And so
[45:06] this being moved is not a movement as
[45:10] such being motivated as such that way
[45:12] but it is something that is it's a
[45:14] movement within uh the individual to
[45:17] bring forth something and we do not
[45:20] maybe know what the full consequence or
[45:22] the result to carry some burden to bear
[45:26] with oneself and to be uh moved inwardly
[45:31] and I like this last word and that's why
[45:33] I highlighted and underlined it promise.
[45:36] ed an impulse motivated. There's
[45:40] something that motivates a person and we
[45:43] don't always understand our actions as a
[45:46] result of that motivation. We spoke of
[45:49] uh people who are highly motivated,
[45:51] people who are uh are they're mediocre
[45:54] about things, but they're not highly
[45:56] motivated. And we hear we hear these
[45:59] these kind of comments which we're are
[46:01] familiar with. Now, I like to just go to
[46:04] slide three. if you would please.
[46:07] Because the now the prophet in trying to
[46:10] do God a service, he speaks of the ark
[46:13] of the Lord and how it was to be carried
[46:16] was on the shoulders of his ministers.
[46:19] His ministers was the Levites uh put it
[46:23] up put it up over their left shoulder
[46:26] and packed that ark like that because it
[46:30] was up over their heart. They had the
[46:34] burden of the word on their heart.
[46:37] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[46:38] &gt;&gt; Now, so we can just take that off for a
[46:40] moment. They had the Now, that's that's
[46:43] what the messenger said, and I trust you
[46:45] believe that.
[46:46] &gt;&gt; Now, you are here this morning and you
[46:50] have a certain area of responsibility.
[46:52] You have a certain burden. Everybody's
[46:55] in a different capacity. They have
[46:57] Everybody has a different post of duty.
[46:59] But we all have a post of duty. You
[47:02] believe that? Every person here, I don't
[47:04] care how young you are, whatever God
[47:07] makes known to you, you have a post of
[47:10] duty, you have a a responsibility to be
[47:13] a witness. You have a responsibility to
[47:16] manifest the the word that God is has
[47:20] placed in your heart. You have a
[47:22] responsibility and that's that's not
[47:25] that's not just some light uh thing, but
[47:28] that is a serious matter. Amen.
[47:31] &gt;&gt; And I stand here this morning, you know,
[47:33] we come to the pulpit even after 45, 50
[47:36] years now of of being behind pulpits
[47:39] still trembling. You tremble not because
[47:42] of the people, but you tremble at the
[47:45] responsibility.
[47:47] &gt;&gt; Just think of a person. I I was on on my
[47:50] mind it on my mind uh uh often. What
[47:54] would Brother Brand says? Well, you
[47:56] know, the people that are before him, he
[47:59] loves them. Well, how would you lead
[48:01] them astray? Uh, you know,
[48:04] intentionally, what a responsibility to
[48:06] say something wrong and uh misdirect to
[48:09] life. My, what would that be in in in
[48:12] the other dimension in another eternity
[48:14] in eternity, it's such a responsibility.
[48:17] And so, a person, you know, each one of
[48:19] us. And so the burden of the word of the
[48:21] Lord, I stand here, you sitting there,
[48:24] you have your responsibility, I have my
[48:27] responsibility, but the burden of the
[48:29] word of the Lord was to be carried on
[48:31] the shoulders of the ministry. And God
[48:34] in God holds him accountable for that.
[48:38] And so I I trust that you understand
[48:40] that's the way it was. And brother
[48:41] Brandham said that in doing God a
[48:44] service without his will, as I said to
[48:46] you also on Wednesday. And I'm just
[48:47] covering a couple of the things from
[48:49] that service. We had a good time, didn't
[48:52] we?
[48:52] &gt;&gt; Amen. But he was talking to the
[48:55] businessmen because the Christian
[48:56] businessmen international felt that they
[48:59] could do the job. The ministry had
[49:01] failed. The ministry had divided the
[49:03] church all up into a into a whole lot of
[49:06] uh uh denominational uh you know,
[49:10] segregated them out and divided them up.
[49:12] And brother Brandham was was for them on
[49:16] that one on that one aspect to bring
[49:18] them together and and and let the walls
[49:20] of that divided them uh let them
[49:23] disappear. And he said when the you know
[49:25] when the when the ducks are in their
[49:27] various pens, they're all divided up.
[49:29] But when the water rises high enough,
[49:31] then they all mingle together and the
[49:33] fences are all gone. And so he was 100%
[49:36] for them. And he said he had opened up
[49:38] many chapters for them because there
[49:40] were certain aspects that he was very
[49:42] much in favor of. But being all divided
[49:44] up, he wasn't in favor of that at all.
[49:47] And so, but they they went over the
[49:50] boundary of their responsibility. They
[49:52] were businessmen. They had the money.
[49:53] They could do the things. And uh and so
[49:56] they said the ministry failed. We'll do
[49:58] it. And that's why he preached this
[49:59] message. It can't go on the shoulders of
[50:01] businessmen.
[50:02] &gt;&gt; It had to go on the shoulders of those
[50:04] that had the burden of the word of the
[50:06] Lord. Amen.
[50:08] &gt;&gt; All right. So, we can take that slide
[50:11] down, please. Thank you. And uh in the
[50:14] invisible union,
[50:16] just laying some foundation here as we
[50:19] move through. Invisible union of the
[50:22] bride. He said, "Would you imagine
[50:24] Peter, James, and John going before a
[50:27] psychiatrist?" Now, he's talking about
[50:28] those that handle the word of the Lord.
[50:32] Would you could you imagine Peter,
[50:33] James, and John going before a
[50:35] psychiatrist? because some organizations
[50:37] were requiring their ministry before
[50:39] they send them out, before they put them
[50:41] into ministry to go before a
[50:42] psychiatrist.
[50:45] He said, "Remember that 120 up there,
[50:49] they couldn't even sign their own names.
[50:51] Standing before a psychiatrist to see if
[50:54] their reflex was just right and so
[50:57] forth, he said they had a reflex,
[51:00] but it wasn't an intellectual conception
[51:03] or scientific research. It was through
[51:06] the power of God. They were motivated.
[51:09] They had an impulse. They had a reflex.
[51:12] They were motivated by the power of God.
[51:14] These men who who spoke the scripture,
[51:18] they were moved by the Holy Ghost. They
[51:21] spoke things they didn't realize. They
[51:25] did things that were strange to them,
[51:27] but they did it under the impulse of the
[51:30] Holy Spirit.
[51:32] There are some powers that are
[51:36] uh
[51:38] I would guess are all inclusive
[51:41] completely inclusive of all humanity.
[51:44] One of those is gravity.
[51:47] &gt;&gt; We're all subject to gravity.
[51:49] &gt;&gt; There isn't anybody here isn't subject
[51:51] to gravity.
[51:52] &gt;&gt; And it's very very rare when Enoch and
[51:55] Elijah
[51:57] became free of gravity. The Lord Jesus
[52:01] was free of gravity. But as far as
[52:03] humanity is concerned, we're all subject
[52:06] to gravity. That's one of the powers.
[52:09] And then the prophet comes and says,
[52:11] there's only two powers in the world.
[52:14] There's only two powers. The power of
[52:16] God and the power of Satan.
[52:20] &gt;&gt; The power of life and the power of
[52:23] death. And so this morning, I can say
[52:27] with authority,
[52:28] &gt;&gt; Amen. Every person here is being moved
[52:33] by one of those two powers.
[52:36] &gt;&gt; And you may not realize it. There are a
[52:39] lot of people being moved by the power
[52:40] of death that doesn't realize it. They
[52:43] think I'm having a great time. Oh, this
[52:46] is so uh this is so, you know, uh
[52:51] fulfilling to the flesh, but it's just
[52:53] the flesh.
[52:55] &gt;&gt; This is so satisfying. This is so
[52:57] gratifying. This is such a stimulating
[53:00] stimulating thing, but it's all death.
[53:04] &gt;&gt; And then there are believers that are
[53:05] going through grinding times, difficult
[53:09] times. Have you had it?
[53:13] &gt;&gt; Oh, we're going to talk about it this
[53:14] morning. Going through times and they
[53:16] say, "What's happening?"
[53:18] &gt;&gt; You've said it.
[53:20] &gt;&gt; Sure you have. What's going on?
[53:23] &gt;&gt; You've said it.
[53:24] &gt;&gt; Oh, all of us have. This isn't what I
[53:27] expected. my Lord, I need you now. And
[53:30] yet, they didn't realize it, but even
[53:33] the spirit of life, they're being moved
[53:35] by the spirit of life. It wasn't death.
[53:38] It's not death that's moving the
[53:39] believer. It's life that's moving us
[53:41] this morning. I can announce to you this
[53:44] morning, every believer, uh, the
[53:46] bornagain believer, the word of God, is
[53:49] being moved this morning by the Holy
[53:52] Spirit.
[53:54] You came into this service this morning
[53:56] moved
[53:57] &gt;&gt; by God.
[53:59] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. It wasn't the devil that
[54:01] brought you here.
[54:05] &gt;&gt; That is absolutely true.
[54:07] &gt;&gt; And yet anything that's contrary to the
[54:09] word is death. And there's a lot of
[54:12] people sitting in pews, in churches, in
[54:15] buildings, and in various places of
[54:18] gatherings. And they and they actually
[54:21] believe we're here by God's will for
[54:25] life and actually death is on the road.
[54:29] &gt;&gt; Death has moved them.
[54:30] &gt;&gt; Death has actually moved them because
[54:32] it's a deception. It's contrary to the
[54:35] word. I I've I've had people I've been
[54:38] in churches I've been in gatherings when
[54:41] you when they started out and it was
[54:43] just worship and oh they waved their
[54:45] hands and clap like you clap raise their
[54:48] hands like you raised their hand and
[54:50] then soon as I mentioned being baptized
[54:53] in the water in the name of the Lord
[54:55] Jesus Christ they become downcast
[54:58] &gt;&gt; immediately. So is it life that was
[55:01] moving them or death that's moving them?
[55:04] And the scripture tells us that the man
[55:06] of sin will even set himself up in the
[55:09] temple of God to be worshiped of God.
[55:11] And I guarantee you if he does that,
[55:14] there are those that are worshiping him.
[55:16] And the scripture tells us in Revelation
[55:19] that all all a ll whose names are not in
[55:23] the book of life will worship the beast.
[55:29] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[55:30] I say hallelujah because that's all part
[55:32] of the plan of God.
[55:36] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[55:41] And so
[55:43] he says he spoke of those in the upper
[55:46] room. It was through the power of God.
[55:49] He says, "And when it struck them,
[55:52] they knew nothing to do but act out what
[55:55] the Holy Ghost said
[55:57] &gt;&gt; to do."
[55:58] &gt;&gt; Amen. They didn't pay any attention to
[56:00] any intellectual.
[56:02] What the church said, what the priest
[56:05] said, and what this said and that said,
[56:08] they move by the spirit. Fearless men.
[56:13] &gt;&gt; That was it then and that is it today.
[56:17] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Fearless men, fearless
[56:21] women. Amen.
[56:24] &gt;&gt; So now
[56:26] some of these powers which I said
[56:29] earlier seem to be all inclusive. The
[56:32] power of the grave
[56:35] to this time
[56:37] is largely every person is subject to
[56:40] it. Many have tried to escape it. And
[56:43] many today, of course, we're occupied
[56:46] with living as long as we can. But
[56:49] eventually, outside of a change of this
[56:52] body and the rapture of the living
[56:54] church, outside of that, the grave is
[56:57] all inclusive.
[56:59] &gt;&gt; And the scripture says, David cried out
[57:02] in Psalms 49 and 15. He said, "But God
[57:05] will redeem my soul from the power of
[57:09] the grave, for he shall receive me." And
[57:13] the uh Paul says in Hebrews,
[57:17] for as much as then, for as much then as
[57:20] the children are partakers of flesh and
[57:22] blood, he also uh likewise took part of
[57:27] the same that through death, he might
[57:31] destroy him that had the power of death.
[57:35] Now, if he destroys him who has the
[57:37] power of death, then the power of death
[57:39] will cease to exist. And the scripture
[57:42] says that this is why Christ came and he
[57:45] took part of the same. We are partakers
[57:48] of flesh. He became a partaker of flesh
[57:51] and blood and and he and through death
[57:55] he went through death that he might
[57:57] destroy him who had the power of death.
[58:01] I thank you. I thank the Lord today that
[58:03] I can say to you there are some things
[58:05] which are potential our our eternal
[58:08] life. We are uh we already possess it.
[58:13] But there are many things incorporated
[58:15] or included in eternal life which
[58:18] presently are potential for us. There's
[58:21] there's those of the unbelieving. Satan,
[58:24] he's already potentially in a lake of
[58:28] fire.
[58:28] &gt;&gt; He's already potentially destroyed.
[58:32] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[58:34] In 1 Corinthians also 1:18, it said,
[58:38] "For the preaching of the cross is to
[58:41] them that perish foolishness, but unto
[58:44] us which are saved, it is the power of
[58:48] God." I want to say to this listening
[58:52] congregation this morning,
[58:55] &gt;&gt; the power of God for the believer,
[58:59] &gt;&gt; and you must include yourself or exclude
[59:01] yourself from it, but I include myself.
[59:05] Do you include yourself?
[59:07] &gt;&gt; The power of God is all inclusive to
[59:10] every believer.
[59:12] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[59:13] &gt;&gt; The power of God is all inclusive to
[59:17] every believer.
[59:18] Now, Paul was speaking in his own
[59:22] defense before King Agria.
[59:25] I love I love Paul's comments. Oh, you
[59:29] ought to read it sometime. Maybe you'd
[59:32] like to read it this afternoon. Acts in
[59:34] the 26th chapter. You might want to turn
[59:36] to Acts 26. We're going to uh read a few
[59:40] verses there. But he was relating how
[59:44] this great light and whose brightness
[59:47] was greater than the sun and that a
[59:50] voice spoke out of the light and that he
[59:53] Paul should go to the Gentiles. This is
[59:56] what he was relating to King Agria. And
[59:59] he says in verse 14, Acts 26, "And when
[1:00:03] we were all fallen to the earth, I heard
[1:00:06] a voice speaking unto me and saying in
[1:00:09] the Hebrew tongue, Saul, Saul, why
[1:00:12] persecutest thou me? It is hard for thee
[1:00:15] to kick against the pricks." And I said,
[1:00:18] "Who art thou, Lord?" And he said, I am
[1:00:22] Jesus whom thou persecutest, but rise
[1:00:25] and stand upon thy feet, for I have
[1:00:28] appeared unto thee for this purpose, to
[1:00:31] make thee a minister and a witness both
[1:00:33] of these things which thou hast seen and
[1:00:36] of those things in which I will appear
[1:00:38] unto thee. Just stop there for a moment.
[1:00:40] Hold your place.
[1:00:43] If you were to read the account of this
[1:00:47] happening that that Paul is now
[1:00:49] relating, if you read it in Acts the 9th
[1:00:52] chapter where it happened, none of these
[1:00:55] words appear there.
[1:00:58] &gt;&gt; Paul is actually giving King Agria a
[1:01:02] more complete picture
[1:01:04] &gt;&gt; of what happened. Even these words do
[1:01:07] not appear there. Paul is saying things
[1:01:10] to a grippa that God said to him at that
[1:01:13] day and this is the only place they
[1:01:15] actually appear this. But rise and stand
[1:01:18] upon thy feet. For I have appeared unto
[1:01:20] thee for this purpose, to make thee a
[1:01:23] minister, and a witness both of these
[1:01:25] things which thou hast seen, and of
[1:01:27] those things in which I will appear unto
[1:01:29] thee, delivering thee from the people,
[1:01:32] and from the Gentiles, unto whom now I
[1:01:35] send thee to open their eyes. And now
[1:01:39] listen, this is the verse I want you to
[1:01:40] notice. To open their eyes. This is why
[1:01:43] God was going to send Paul to the
[1:01:45] Gentiles to open their eyes and turn
[1:01:49] them from the darkness of light, from
[1:01:52] the darkness to light, and from the
[1:01:55] power of Satan unto God, that they may
[1:01:58] receive forgiveness of sins, and
[1:02:01] inheritance among them which are
[1:02:03] sanctified by faith that is in me.
[1:02:06] &gt;&gt; You know, friends, I I I'm just consumed
[1:02:09] this morning to think that God Almighty
[1:02:13] would take one man,
[1:02:15] &gt;&gt; Paul the Apostle, and tell him, "I'm
[1:02:18] sending you to the Gentiles." The very
[1:02:22] man who was who was obsessed. He was
[1:02:26] just obsessed to take every Christian
[1:02:29] and cast them into jail. And he says
[1:02:31] that he cast many into jail. He cast
[1:02:34] them into prison. He was hunting them
[1:02:36] down. And here God took that man. You
[1:02:40] talk about turning a person around. Turn
[1:02:43] him around from a from a a a a
[1:02:47] persecutor of the church and a renegade
[1:02:50] as he were. Turn him completely around
[1:02:52] and made him an apostle. And not only
[1:02:56] that, he says to open the eyes
[1:03:00] to turn them from darkness to light and
[1:03:03] from the power of Satan unto God. One
[1:03:06] man was being sent now and he was going
[1:03:09] to spearhead the movement of the early
[1:03:11] church.
[1:03:13] Think of the ministry that thing now
[1:03:16] that was no wonder he was so gripped. He
[1:03:19] was being moved by a spirit that was in
[1:03:22] him and that was going to turn actually
[1:03:26] turn the Gentiles from darkness to light
[1:03:30] and release them from the power of Satan
[1:03:34] unto God. The church, friends, the
[1:03:37] believer has, and I'm speaking of I'm
[1:03:40] speaking to believers today, has power
[1:03:44] &gt;&gt; over Satan.
[1:03:46] &gt;&gt; Power over darkness.
[1:03:48] &gt;&gt; And I think I should say, don't forget
[1:03:50] it.
[1:03:52] &gt;&gt; We have power.
[1:03:54] &gt;&gt; It's something that's moving. You don't
[1:03:56] feel it always, but it's something
[1:03:58] that's moving. We're being moved by the
[1:04:01] Holy Ghost. The Holy Ghost can never
[1:04:04] never be subject to Satan.
[1:04:07] &gt;&gt; The Holy Ghost can never be subject to
[1:04:10] the spirit of darkness.
[1:04:12] &gt;&gt; The Holy Ghost is life.
[1:04:14] &gt;&gt; And we are being moved by life.
[1:04:16] &gt;&gt; I want to announce that to you
[1:04:18] irrevocably. We're being moved by the
[1:04:21] power of life.
[1:04:23] &gt;&gt; Eternal life. Amen.
[1:04:27] &gt;&gt; Turn to be converted.
[1:04:31] Now
[1:04:39] there's a quote and this one I want you
[1:04:42] to listen very very closely to and I'll
[1:04:44] appreciate your undivided attention.
[1:04:49] In the fifth seal, brother Bram speaks
[1:04:52] about Polycarp.
[1:04:56] And on his
[1:04:58] uh road coming down, he was talking. He
[1:05:00] said he was walking with his head down.
[1:05:03] And the Roman centurion was saying to
[1:05:07] Polyarp, "You're an old man
[1:05:11] and you're well respected. Why don't you
[1:05:14] denounce the thing?"
[1:05:17] He just kept looking towards heaven
[1:05:21] and a voice spoke from somewhere. They
[1:05:24] couldn't understand where and said,
[1:05:27] "Poly carp,
[1:05:30] &gt;&gt; don't fear. I'm with you."
[1:05:34] &gt;&gt; Why? He was standing by that word.
[1:05:37] And when they begin to pile the wood,
[1:05:40] the boards on him to burn him, there was
[1:05:43] a heavenly music that came down and the
[1:05:47] anthems from some angelic somewhere
[1:05:49] singing songs. He never even one time
[1:05:53] batted an eye to them. That's gallant
[1:05:56] men. That's men who can stand. And now I
[1:06:00] want this the fifth slide up because
[1:06:03] this is the next part of this quote. The
[1:06:06] martyrs down through the ages. They
[1:06:09] suffered terribly.
[1:06:11] But what were they? They were under the
[1:06:15] inspiration,
[1:06:16] the spirit of God, the power. And don't
[1:06:20] forget this church.
[1:06:23] Please don't forget this church. How
[1:06:26] could man do anything else besides the
[1:06:30] power of God that had been released to
[1:06:34] them? And I am not talking about the
[1:06:36] martyrs now. They had their day.
[1:06:40] &gt;&gt; They had and sometimes death would
[1:06:42] actually be preferred over life.
[1:06:48] I can tell you friends, it is more
[1:06:51] difficult to live day after day and week
[1:06:56] after week and month after month and
[1:07:00] year after year with the forces of this
[1:07:04] power and that influence and the world
[1:07:07] and the oppression and the evil and the
[1:07:10] temptation and the sin that's everywhere
[1:07:13] and the sickness and the disease.
[1:07:15] disease and the death and everything
[1:07:17] that's around us. It is easier, it's
[1:07:20] preferable many times to say if they
[1:07:22] said deny this or die, you just say let
[1:07:26] me die
[1:07:27] &gt;&gt; and you're out of it and you cross over
[1:07:29] and you're gone home. But to fight with
[1:07:31] it every day, every day, every day. But
[1:07:34] I say I said I'll tell you my friends,
[1:07:36] the prophet still said this was the
[1:07:38] golden age.
[1:07:40] &gt;&gt; And there's not many going to come out
[1:07:44] of it victorious. But there are some.
[1:07:46] And the reason why they'll come out
[1:07:48] victorious, I want you to hear it and
[1:07:51] hear it good. Is because there has been
[1:07:53] a power
[1:07:55] &gt;&gt; released upon the church
[1:07:57] &gt;&gt; for this hour
[1:07:59] &gt;&gt; and they can do nothing else.
[1:08:04] We can respond no other way. We can only
[1:08:08] respond according to the power that's
[1:08:11] been released to us.
[1:08:13] &gt;&gt; And I guarantee you, God has not brought
[1:08:17] us here to this time to have a defeated
[1:08:20] church. She's a glorious church. The
[1:08:23] Bible says without spot and without
[1:08:26] wrinkle or any such thing.
[1:08:32] Glory to God.
[1:08:35] &gt;&gt; He says they couldn't do nothing else.
[1:08:40] &gt;&gt; On in the fifth seal as well, he said if
[1:08:43] God sends a certain spirit among them,
[1:08:46] that's the only thing that they can work
[1:08:48] by.
[1:08:49] &gt;&gt; If God sends a certain spirit, that's
[1:08:52] the only thing they can work by.
[1:08:54] &gt;&gt; God has sent a spirit in this end time.
[1:08:58] It is different from other times. The
[1:09:01] same spirit but a different intensity, a
[1:09:04] different capacity to achieve a
[1:09:07] different thing. I say God has sent a
[1:09:10] spirit that witnesses within the
[1:09:12] believer today that this is the third
[1:09:14] exodus. That this is the resurrection
[1:09:17] time, that this is the rapture time,
[1:09:20] that this is a time when when the bodies
[1:09:22] of men and women will experience a sweep
[1:09:25] of some kind, and they'll be changed in
[1:09:28] their atoms from mortal to immortality.
[1:09:31] That's what the spirit says within us.
[1:09:37] And we can do nothing else than be moved
[1:09:40] by that which has been released at this
[1:09:42] time.
[1:09:43] &gt;&gt; It's a resurrection time.
[1:09:45] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:09:47] &gt;&gt; We can do nothing else
[1:09:50] &gt;&gt; than act
[1:09:51] &gt;&gt; according to the spirit that's been
[1:09:53] released. If God hadn't released it,
[1:09:56] that's why I read the scripture in in
[1:09:58] first Peter.
[1:10:00] the the prophets, they prophesied of it
[1:10:03] and they searched what manner and of
[1:10:06] time what what manner and what manner of
[1:10:09] time that this should come and they
[1:10:11] spoke of the glories that should take
[1:10:14] place, the grace that should come to us
[1:10:18] and they desired to know.
[1:10:21] Brother Brandham says continuing in the
[1:10:23] fifth seal, he says, "We'll prove to you
[1:10:25] by the history of the church and by the
[1:10:28] opening of the seals and the powers that
[1:10:31] let loose." He said, "And watch exactly
[1:10:34] the church responded to the anointing
[1:10:37] and they couldn't do nothing else."
[1:10:42] &gt;&gt; You're here. You've been motivated by
[1:10:44] something. We haven't come here simply
[1:10:47] because we know someone or we have a
[1:10:49] certain uh uh a certain association. My
[1:10:53] friends are there. That's not why we're
[1:10:55] here. My parents are there or my
[1:10:57] children are there. That's not if that's
[1:10:58] what motivates us. That's as far as it
[1:11:01] goes. But there's a people that are in
[1:11:03] the land today that are being motivated
[1:11:06] by the anointing that has been released
[1:11:08] to us
[1:11:10] &gt;&gt; at this hour.
[1:11:11] &gt;&gt; And it's a victorious power. Amen.
[1:11:14] &gt;&gt; Glory to God.
[1:11:17] &gt;&gt; You may not always be and more than
[1:11:20] likely you won't be, you know, just
[1:11:23] dancing about and feeling, you know,
[1:11:25] jubilant as such because it's a battle.
[1:11:29] &gt;&gt; It's a real struggle.
[1:11:31] &gt;&gt; But I have to announce to you, I feel
[1:11:33] called to tell you today that we can do
[1:11:36] nothing other than than act and be
[1:11:39] motivated by the spirit that's been
[1:11:41] released to us. And I can tell you a
[1:11:43] spirit has been released.
[1:11:47] &gt;&gt; God sent a messenger to release the
[1:11:49] spirit of that word.
[1:11:53] &gt;&gt; See, he sends a word. He holds it back,
[1:11:56] &gt;&gt; but then he he releases the word at a
[1:11:59] certain season and then the Holy Spirit
[1:12:02] comes to make that word for that season
[1:12:06] come alive.
[1:12:08] &gt;&gt; And there is no other way for it to
[1:12:10] happen. Amen.
[1:12:12] &gt;&gt; The scripture tells us of the 120, the
[1:12:15] Bible says there were above, that's more
[1:12:18] than 500 people who heard the words of
[1:12:22] Jesus after he was resurrected.
[1:12:25] &gt;&gt; And the instructions go to Jerusalem and
[1:12:28] carry there for the Holy Spirit until
[1:12:31] you be endued with power from on high.
[1:12:34] Of the 500, more than 500, 380
[1:12:39] found other responsibilities and they
[1:12:42] were motivated to tend to their things
[1:12:45] while 120 were motivated to go and sit
[1:12:48] and do nothing.
[1:12:50] &gt;&gt; And wait for a for 10 days.
[1:12:54] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And maybe there was no
[1:12:56] feeling, but they thought maybe I got
[1:12:57] it. Brother Brand says of I believe
[1:13:00] Peter, maybe I got it. No, no, it wasn't
[1:13:02] yet. But when it came
[1:13:05] &gt;&gt; and they were not there, Jesus notice
[1:13:08] did not instruct the disciples or anyone
[1:13:11] in a special way like I would maybe say,
[1:13:14] "Brother Dy, you be brother John, you be
[1:13:16] sure and be there." The deacons, uh, you
[1:13:18] be sure and be there. This is very
[1:13:20] important. Jesus, he just, he just threw
[1:13:22] the word out,
[1:13:24] &gt;&gt; and those that had received the word
[1:13:26] were there.
[1:13:28] &gt;&gt; The Holy Spirit didn't come to Peter,
[1:13:30] James, and John. The Holy Spirit came to
[1:13:33] the word
[1:13:36] &gt;&gt; and they that had the word, they that
[1:13:39] had the word could do nothing else but
[1:13:42] respond.
[1:13:44] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:13:45] &gt;&gt; We're not here because we just feel
[1:13:48] we're certain class of people. We're
[1:13:50] here because God has sent a word and
[1:13:53] that word has shed a light in our hearts
[1:13:55] and we can do nothing else and act upon
[1:13:58] that word.
[1:13:59] &gt;&gt; There's something within us.
[1:14:02] And we can't explain it.
[1:14:04] &gt;&gt; We're a driven people.
[1:14:08] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:14:11] &gt;&gt; We're driven.
[1:14:15] &gt;&gt; For and against.
[1:14:17] &gt;&gt; There are things in this world I can't
[1:14:19] stand.
[1:14:20] &gt;&gt; There's things in this world that really
[1:14:24] are difficult for us as believers. Goes
[1:14:28] against us.
[1:14:31] It's hard,
[1:14:32] &gt;&gt; but there are things that we know we've
[1:14:36] been called to do and we must do it and
[1:14:40] we will do it.
[1:14:45] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:14:51] Turn to Acts the 10th chapter.
[1:14:58] in Acts the 10th chapter. I just
[1:15:00] referred to it and some of you may have
[1:15:03] read it referred to it Wednesday.
[1:15:09] The account is this because I'm just
[1:15:12] going to read just a very very little
[1:15:14] bit of it. But I want to give you the
[1:15:15] first account. The account of it is this
[1:15:18] that Cornelius
[1:15:19] the centurion
[1:15:21] of the Italian band.
[1:15:24] Don't don't forget that he was over a
[1:15:28] hundred men in the in the Roman army.
[1:15:32] The army which had taken Jesus under
[1:15:36] their possession
[1:15:38] and with their leaders had brought him
[1:15:40] to the cross. Don't forget it's his army
[1:15:43] that guarded the tomb.
[1:15:46] He's a member of this army of Rome.
[1:15:50] But he's a godly man.
[1:15:53] &gt;&gt; He does something the rest of the army
[1:15:55] doesn't do. He prays always
[1:15:58] &gt;&gt; and he's a giver of arms. And all when
[1:16:03] they Lord came and spoke to him and
[1:16:05] said, "Your arms and your prayers have
[1:16:10] come up for remembrance before God," he
[1:16:12] perhaps didn't ever realize that that's
[1:16:15] what was happening. But an angel came to
[1:16:17] him and said, "Send men to Japa and
[1:16:22] called for one, Simon Peter." He's at
[1:16:25] Simon the Tanner's house. And he sent
[1:16:28] men to them. And Peter had just had a
[1:16:32] vision and he saw this sheet coming down
[1:16:35] with all kinds of animals and fowl and
[1:16:38] creeping things in it. And a voice said,
[1:16:41] "Rise up, Peter. Take an eat." And he
[1:16:43] said, "I've never touched an unclean
[1:16:46] thing to my lips." And it came three
[1:16:48] times.
[1:16:51] And then
[1:16:53] immediately there's men at the door to
[1:16:56] receive him and to bring a message and
[1:16:58] to tell him about Cornelius that they've
[1:17:00] been sent. So Peter goes with them the
[1:17:03] next day on the marorrow. The Bible says
[1:17:06] Peter went with them and certain
[1:17:08] brethren from Japa and accompanied them.
[1:17:12] And I'm going to go on down to the 40 uh
[1:17:20] I guess we'll go down to about verse 32.
[1:17:26] And uh Cornelius now
[1:17:29] is speaking. He's speaking 4 days ago.
[1:17:32] Verse 30. I was fasting until this hour.
[1:17:36] Verse 32.
[1:17:38] Send therefore
[1:17:41] uh to Japa and call thither hither Simon
[1:17:44] whose surname is Peter. He is lodged in
[1:17:47] the house of one Simon a tanner by the
[1:17:50] seaside who when he cometh shall speak
[1:17:53] unto thee. Immediately therefore I sent
[1:17:56] to thee and thou hast well done
[1:18:00] that thou art come. Notice these words.
[1:18:03] Now therefore
[1:18:05] are we all here present before God to
[1:18:11] hear all things that are commanded thee
[1:18:14] of God. This man when he saw Peter he
[1:18:18] was so filled with respect. Here's Peter
[1:18:21] uh ignorant fisherman as he were. He's
[1:18:25] and all that Cornelius knows is that a
[1:18:29] one in shining clothing has come to him
[1:18:31] and said call for this man. He had such
[1:18:34] respect to that experience. He fell down
[1:18:37] to worship Peter. And Peter took him up.
[1:18:40] Said, "Don't worship me. I'm a man
[1:18:42] also." But he he's got exactly the right
[1:18:46] desire. He said, "We are all present."
[1:18:48] And the Bible says that he had gathered
[1:18:51] his friends. He gathered those that he
[1:18:54] had influence over. He was so confident.
[1:18:57] He was so filled with expectation that
[1:19:00] something was going to happen to him.
[1:19:02] And the Bible says, "And Peter opened
[1:19:04] his mouth and said, "Of a truth, I
[1:19:07] perceive that God," this verse 34, "is
[1:19:10] no respect of person, but in every
[1:19:12] nation, he that fearth him and workketh
[1:19:14] righteousness is accepted of him." And
[1:19:17] then he goes on into the account of
[1:19:20] Christ, and go down to verse 43. To him
[1:19:25] give all the prophets witness, that
[1:19:28] through his name, whosoever believeth in
[1:19:31] him shall receive remission of sins. And
[1:19:35] while Peter yet spake these words, the
[1:19:39] Holy Ghost fell on all of them which
[1:19:43] heard the word, and they of the
[1:19:45] circumcision which believed were
[1:19:47] astonished, as many as came with Peter,
[1:19:50] because that on the Gentiles also was
[1:19:53] poured out the gift of the Holy Ghost.
[1:19:55] For they heard them speak with tongues
[1:19:58] or languages, and magnify God. And then
[1:20:02] answered Peter, Can any man forbid water
[1:20:05] that these should not be baptized which
[1:20:07] have received the Holy Ghost as well as
[1:20:10] we? And he commanded them to be baptized
[1:20:12] in the name of the Lord and then prayed
[1:20:16] they him to tarry certain days. The
[1:20:20] Bible says that the Holy Ghost fell upon
[1:20:24] them. I was I was impressed with this
[1:20:28] and I wanted to go a little further, a
[1:20:30] little deeper into it. This fall, it
[1:20:35] wasn't just that they had this uh you
[1:20:38] know this sudden momentary thing, but
[1:20:41] the Holy Ghost fell upon them. The word
[1:20:43] is the Holy Ghost seized them.
[1:20:46] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:20:47] &gt;&gt; The Holy Ghost took control of them.
[1:20:52] &gt;&gt; It fell upon them.
[1:20:54] &gt;&gt; Amen. and took possession of him. He
[1:20:57] took possession of him that they would
[1:20:59] then continue to be used.
[1:21:02] And it says it took him in his in the to
[1:21:06] be used of the Holy Spirit in his
[1:21:09] inspiration and his impulse.
[1:21:12] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:21:13] &gt;&gt; Oh, I hope that you are following along
[1:21:16] with me. It wasn't just something just
[1:21:18] fell and they they spoke in other
[1:21:20] languages and other tongues. It wasn't
[1:21:22] that. It was indeed more than that. The
[1:21:24] Holy Spirit seized them.
[1:21:27] &gt;&gt; You know, we got a few hundred people
[1:21:29] here and many more on the internet this
[1:21:32] morning listening live.
[1:21:34] It may well be that the Holy Spirit
[1:21:38] hasn't seized a person. When it when
[1:21:40] you're seized, you'll understand it as
[1:21:42] we go on through the scripture and
[1:21:44] through the service this morning. You
[1:21:46] may not feel I can believe that one uh a
[1:21:50] person can be actually baptized and
[1:21:53] filled with the Holy Spirit. I'm not
[1:21:54] talking about the gift of the Holy
[1:21:55] Spirit. I'm talking about the Holy
[1:21:57] Spirit himself. Now, the person of the
[1:21:59] Holy Spirit and then you can go through
[1:22:01] reversals and you go through difficulty
[1:22:03] and you begin to question your own mind.
[1:22:05] And I I also have that quote right here.
[1:22:07] Brother Bam says, "Don't do that. That's
[1:22:10] the devil's language. Don't say I'm
[1:22:12] weak. Don't say I can't do it. Oh, I
[1:22:14] wonder if this and I wonder if that. You
[1:22:16] know that God seized you. But there are
[1:22:18] others may perhaps at no time in your
[1:22:21] life did the Holy Spirit actually sees
[1:22:23] you,
[1:22:24] &gt;&gt; take control of you.
[1:22:26] &gt;&gt; How do you know? Well, one way you'll
[1:22:29] know is because there's something that's
[1:22:32] continually within you,
[1:22:35] &gt;&gt; driving you forward,
[1:22:37] &gt;&gt; and you you have this that we spoke of a
[1:22:39] few moments ago. You can do nothing else
[1:22:43] than keep forging ahead when you can see
[1:22:46] no light at the end of the tunnel.
[1:22:48] There's no way to turn, but there's
[1:22:50] something inside. There's something
[1:22:52] within you that's driving you on to your
[1:22:56] ultimate goal.
[1:22:58] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen?
[1:23:01] &gt;&gt; That's the Holy Spirit.
[1:23:04] &gt;&gt; That's the spirit that's been released
[1:23:05] upon this generation. maybe others and
[1:23:08] it hasn't happened to you. I say you
[1:23:11] should not delay. You should not set
[1:23:14] that aside. Don't push it aside. You
[1:23:18] say, "Oh God, you that sent this spirit
[1:23:21] upon the early church and you have
[1:23:24] released a special allotment." And I
[1:23:28] going to come to that a special
[1:23:30] allotment at this time. you have
[1:23:34] assigned
[1:23:35] &gt;&gt; to this generation.
[1:23:38] &gt;&gt; How many believe the seals have been
[1:23:39] opened?
[1:23:41] &gt;&gt; How many believe the mysteries been
[1:23:42] revealed?
[1:23:44] &gt;&gt; Then that means God has has exposed has
[1:23:50] made known uh of his word which is a
[1:23:53] lifegiving word. Now he's opened it up
[1:23:56] not to become mental information. He's
[1:23:59] opened it up for the purpose that a
[1:24:01] people who have been born in the in a
[1:24:05] human community and raised to this.
[1:24:08] You've been born like Elijah was born.
[1:24:10] You've been born like Moses was born.
[1:24:12] You've been born like the early church
[1:24:14] was born. You're born like the men and
[1:24:17] women who are here when Jesus walked
[1:24:19] here.
[1:24:20] &gt;&gt; You're no different.
[1:24:21] &gt;&gt; You had a mother or father and you
[1:24:23] issued out into the world. And you came
[1:24:26] at this season.
[1:24:28] At this season when God would make
[1:24:30] known. So God released his word.
[1:24:33] &gt;&gt; He made known things that were not
[1:24:35] previously known.
[1:24:36] &gt;&gt; They were held back. People desired to
[1:24:39] know. They couldn't know. God held it
[1:24:41] back. And he released the word not to
[1:24:44] become mental information. But there was
[1:24:46] a people that were born in this age.
[1:24:50] &gt;&gt; And they were ordained of God to hear
[1:24:53] what had been released.
[1:24:55] Furthermore, they've been elected by
[1:24:58] God, chosen, and predestinated for this
[1:25:01] hour to receive that word which is
[1:25:04] spoken.
[1:25:05] &gt;&gt; And when they received that word in
[1:25:06] faith, the Holy Ghost came down upon
[1:25:09] that word
[1:25:11] &gt;&gt; and made that word to start to be thrust
[1:25:14] through, begin to manifest, begin to
[1:25:17] move itself through those people. And
[1:25:19] maybe they didn't realize what they're
[1:25:21] doing. Didn't realize what they're
[1:25:23] saying. They just couldn't realize it.
[1:25:26] Uh never thought they would do those
[1:25:28] things.
[1:25:34] &gt;&gt; And while Peter
[1:25:36] spake these words, the Holy Ghost, I
[1:25:40] want to say, seized them.
[1:25:43] &gt;&gt; The Holy Ghost took possession of them.
[1:25:47] &gt;&gt; I have testimony after testimony. We
[1:25:49] could stay all afternoon here. I look
[1:25:51] over this audience and see uh and look
[1:25:54] into your faces. I know the testimony of
[1:25:57] many here and how they fought. Hey, you
[1:26:00] know, brother brother Johnny Stemon,
[1:26:03] he's not here. He's pastor down in
[1:26:06] Florida. I was preaching in a house and
[1:26:10] his wife was sitting in the in the
[1:26:12] little group in the house and Johnny
[1:26:14] Stemon was unbeliever and he walked by
[1:26:18] the house. He told me and he laughs
[1:26:19] about it now. He said, "I shook my fist
[1:26:21] at that place.
[1:26:24] I was so angry. My wife was in there."
[1:26:26] &gt;&gt; And he said, "I uprooted her and moved
[1:26:29] the whole family to California." Said,
[1:26:31] "I'm getting away from this thing." Oh,
[1:26:33] he's just like a little bit of Apostle
[1:26:35] Paul. I'm going to fight this thing with
[1:26:38] everything that's in me. Shake my fist
[1:26:40] and say all kinds of nasty things. And
[1:26:43] God turned him around. I tell you what,
[1:26:46] God had him by the scuff of the neck and
[1:26:48] say, "Listen here, little boy. You're
[1:26:50] going to do what I got planned for you.
[1:26:54] &gt;&gt; You're going to be a pastor.
[1:26:56] &gt;&gt; You're going to shepherd some of my
[1:26:58] sheep.
[1:26:59] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:27:01] &gt;&gt; Oh, how I thank God some of you here how
[1:27:04] you fought it. Oh, how it wasn't for
[1:27:07] you. Now, that's not for me. I can I can
[1:27:10] just see it.
[1:27:12] &gt;&gt; Ah, yeah. You're running your own life.
[1:27:15] No, you aren't running your own life.
[1:27:17] God's got a hold of every one of his
[1:27:19] children. He's going to bring them
[1:27:20] through one knot hole, two knot holes,
[1:27:23] or three, but he'll bring you through.
[1:27:26] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:27:28] &gt;&gt; And God sees them. It fell upon them. He
[1:27:32] took possession of them and use them and
[1:27:35] they began to be under the inspiration
[1:27:38] and the impulse
[1:27:40] &gt;&gt; of the Holy Spirit.
[1:27:43] &gt;&gt; Oh, hallelujah.
[1:27:46] in the message beginning and ending of
[1:27:48] the gentile dispensation. Isn't this
[1:27:50] isn't that quite a title? The beginning
[1:27:52] and the ending
[1:27:55] of the gentile disper dispensation kind
[1:27:58] of takes us in there, doesn't it?
[1:28:02] And he says it's just the same tonight.
[1:28:06] I wonder what a man I wonder what would
[1:28:09] happen if a man here tonight had the
[1:28:10] power to strike a cross around and say,
[1:28:13] "Look, standing around this tabernacle
[1:28:15] tonight." He says, "You'd be a member
[1:28:19] here the rest of your life." He he's
[1:28:22] making reference to something he just
[1:28:23] said before. He said sometime when you
[1:28:27] can't see it with your natural eyes but
[1:28:30] you can feel the impulse of it something
[1:28:34] near a sixth sense that denotes that
[1:28:38] something is near.
[1:28:40] &gt;&gt; There's a sixth sense that denotes it
[1:28:43] testifies that something is near. I'm
[1:28:46] wanting to make you more sensitive to
[1:28:49] something than more than just what's in
[1:28:52] front of us
[1:28:54] &gt;&gt; or what's beside us. The scripture says,
[1:28:57] "While we look not at the things which
[1:29:02] are seen,"
[1:29:04] you were here Wednesday.
[1:29:07] Those of you that were here said, "If we
[1:29:09] look at the things which are seen,
[1:29:13] just the things that are seen,
[1:29:16] there's a lot here that could make us
[1:29:19] very negative people
[1:29:21] &gt;&gt; as a believer." as a believer. Now to
[1:29:24] those that are in the world, it's it's
[1:29:26] their diet.
[1:29:28] &gt;&gt; That's what they live on.
[1:29:30] &gt;&gt; They don't have anything else, I guess.
[1:29:33] And some of them are, you know, really
[1:29:35] void and vacant inside, but it's their
[1:29:37] diet. So, they party on the weekend and
[1:29:41] any other time they can and do their
[1:29:44] drugs and have their sports and do all
[1:29:47] of the things that are pleasurable to
[1:29:49] them. And I don't I don't I don't knock
[1:29:52] them for that.
[1:29:54] That's the best they got.
[1:29:58] &gt;&gt; An old brother used to say to me, old
[1:30:01] brother Mcgriff used to say about the
[1:30:04] world, said that's the best they got.
[1:30:06] &gt;&gt; That's the best they're ever going to
[1:30:08] have.
[1:30:09] &gt;&gt; Going to have their case of beer and go
[1:30:11] out for the weekend and drag all of
[1:30:13] their things with them, drag their boom
[1:30:16] boxes with them, and drag their
[1:30:18] televisions with them. make a big mess
[1:30:21] out in the out in the woods and they
[1:30:24] might as well stayed home because they
[1:30:25] just dragged everything from home out
[1:30:27] there.
[1:30:28] &gt;&gt; All they got away from that I can say is
[1:30:30] they got away from mowing the lawn.
[1:30:33] &gt;&gt; They just go out there and booze it up.
[1:30:36] And he says that's the best they're ever
[1:30:39] going to have.
[1:30:40] &gt;&gt; He says and just think this is the worst
[1:30:42] we're ever going to have.
[1:30:43] &gt;&gt; Just think it's the worst we're ever
[1:30:45] going to have. You say, "Well, it's
[1:30:46] tough, but it's the worst you're going
[1:30:48] to have. is only getting better.
[1:30:51] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:30:52] &gt;&gt; That's God's promise.
[1:30:57] &gt;&gt; And he says you can feel something near.
[1:31:00] It denotes or it it's it's something
[1:31:03] near you. And he said, "Watch them this
[1:31:05] morning."
[1:31:07] So many things that were happening at
[1:31:09] that time.
[1:31:11] And we all understand what it is to be
[1:31:14] motivated.
[1:31:16] Uh
[1:31:21] you perhaps don't know what's motivating
[1:31:23] you right now.
[1:31:27] Lots of things are motivating the
[1:31:29] people.
[1:31:32] Brother Brham says what went out for to
[1:31:34] see. He said, "Then when a then if a man
[1:31:38] or a woman," he said, "your anointing
[1:31:40] tells on you, whatever your spirit is
[1:31:43] moves you, and you're motivated by a
[1:31:46] spirit." And if the spirit of Christ is
[1:31:50] on the Christians, the believer, no
[1:31:52] wonder he's a peculiar person. No wonder
[1:31:55] there's something moving in him because
[1:31:59] God is in him. The spirit of Christ is
[1:32:02] motivating him and he has to move as the
[1:32:06] spirit moves him.
[1:32:09] &gt;&gt; Now
[1:32:14] different things motivate different
[1:32:15] people. I could say so much about that.
[1:32:18] But I want to speak about the brother
[1:32:20] Bram talks about the token
[1:32:25] and I was going to pass over this but I
[1:32:27] don't feel I should. It's here for
[1:32:29] somebody.
[1:32:31] He said, "Here's what you want to
[1:32:32] believe for. You want to believe you
[1:32:36] want your own safety.
[1:32:40] &gt;&gt; You believe for your safety." Then apply
[1:32:43] the token
[1:32:45] for the whole family.
[1:32:48] You say, "How can I do that?" Now,
[1:32:52] parents, mothers, fathers,
[1:32:55] here's an answer.
[1:32:57] How can I do that?
[1:33:00] He said claim it.
[1:33:03] He said if it worked on you
[1:33:07] then you and the word becomes one.
[1:33:11] &gt;&gt; Amen. He said and see it works for both
[1:33:14] of you. You and the word become one. You
[1:33:18] and the word are one. He says again.
[1:33:21] Then apply it to your children.
[1:33:24] Apply it to your loved ones. like Rahab
[1:33:27] did.
[1:33:27] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:33:28] &gt;&gt; She applied the token. And I thought
[1:33:30] today before I read on, Cornelius was
[1:33:34] one in the New Testament and Rahab was
[1:33:37] one in the Old Testament. Listen
[1:33:40] friends, these two are critical examples
[1:33:43] for us today because I would say if I
[1:33:47] asked for hands, which I will not, but I
[1:33:50] believe there'd probably be close to
[1:33:52] 100%
[1:33:54] of the adults in this assembly that
[1:33:58] would like to raise their hand for
[1:34:00] someone. The prophet is saying, "You
[1:34:03] became one with the word."
[1:34:06] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:34:07] &gt;&gt; You claim it. Now for the others, the
[1:34:10] Bible says of Cornelius that he and his
[1:34:14] household, he believed for his household
[1:34:17] that they would be saved. And we're all
[1:34:20] here, he said, to hear words of thee.
[1:34:22] The two spies said to Rahab, "You gather
[1:34:26] everyone, your brothers, your sisters,
[1:34:30] your mother, your father, and this
[1:34:33] harlot brought them into her house, and
[1:34:36] everyone in her house were preserved."
[1:34:42] &gt;&gt; God did not go in to find out are they
[1:34:45] worthy, did they do this, were they bad
[1:34:48] people, were they good people? He said
[1:34:50] nothing about that. He said, "If you
[1:34:52] bring them in under this token," in
[1:34:55] other words, you have made a covenant
[1:34:57] with God. You've made a covenant. God is
[1:35:00] regarding that covenant. You bring them
[1:35:02] in under this covenant and I will
[1:35:05] respect you. Keep your word, I'll keep
[1:35:07] my word, and they will be saved.
[1:35:10] &gt;&gt; No one will come to destruction. Isn't
[1:35:13] that marvelous?
[1:35:15] &gt;&gt; I believe other groups have tried to
[1:35:17] duplicate that and uh and and whatever
[1:35:20] more. We're not interested what other
[1:35:21] groups have done. We've got a vindicated
[1:35:24] message.
[1:35:26] &gt;&gt; And he says Rahab did. She applied the
[1:35:30] token to her father. She applied it to
[1:35:33] her mother. She applied it to her
[1:35:35] brothers and sisters and got them all
[1:35:39] in. He said, "You apply it. Say, Lord,
[1:35:43] I'm going after my son. I'm going after
[1:35:46] my daughter. I claim her. Satan, you
[1:35:50] turn her loose. I'm coming after her. I
[1:35:54] apply my token. The Holy Spirit, oh,
[1:35:58] Holy Spirit that lives within me, catch
[1:36:00] my daughter there. I'm going out. I'm
[1:36:03] going to her now with your anointing
[1:36:06] upon me. And he will do it. Amen.
[1:36:10] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:36:12] &gt;&gt; How long should we say it? Say it over
[1:36:15] and over.
[1:36:16] &gt;&gt; Say it until you believe it. Amen.
[1:36:19] &gt;&gt; Say it out loud.
[1:36:22] &gt;&gt; As we say on the quote Wednesday, say it
[1:36:25] over and over. Say it again. Say it out
[1:36:28] loud. Speak it. And continue it until
[1:36:31] you believe it.
[1:36:35] &gt;&gt; You know that's powerful
[1:36:37] &gt;&gt; because if a person doesn't really
[1:36:39] believe it, it's so hard to say it.
[1:36:43] &gt;&gt; So hard to say it.
[1:36:45] &gt;&gt; But you say it. harmonize with the word
[1:36:48] of God
[1:36:50] &gt;&gt; and say it over and over and say it out
[1:36:52] loud
[1:36:53] &gt;&gt; and say it until you believe it.
[1:37:11] All right,
[1:37:13] I'm going to read some scripture here in
[1:37:15] a moment.
[1:37:18] that I'd like to
[1:37:20] have you turn with me to Hebrews. I have
[1:37:23] two places I want to read yet.
[1:37:26] Hebrews
[1:37:28] the 11th chapter
[1:37:32] and we're going to just look at verse
[1:37:33] 24.
[1:37:43] By faith, Moses,
[1:37:46] when he was come to years,
[1:37:48] refused to be called the son of
[1:37:50] Pharaoh's daughter, choosing rather to
[1:37:54] suffer with the people of God than to
[1:37:57] enjoy the pleasures of sin for a season,
[1:38:01] esteeming the reproach of Christ greater
[1:38:03] riches than the treasures of Egypt. For
[1:38:07] he had respect under the recompense of
[1:38:10] the reward. And by faith he forsook
[1:38:13] Egypt, not fearing the wrath of the
[1:38:16] king, for he endured. And here's the
[1:38:19] last phrase, as seeing him who is
[1:38:23] invisible.
[1:38:25] I have taken I looked at this scripture
[1:38:27] carefully and I want you all to listen
[1:38:31] very closely because
[1:38:35] I know
[1:38:37] what our lives are like.
[1:38:40] I have good knowledge of it. I
[1:38:42] experience it every day myself.
[1:38:45] And I'm I'm very conscious that if I
[1:38:50] become or if we become
[1:38:55] uh
[1:38:57] dictated to or guided by the things that
[1:39:02] we see, it's impossible for us to live
[1:39:05] victorious lives. Amen.
[1:39:08] &gt;&gt; I said it quietly, but I think you
[1:39:11] understand what I'm saying. If we see
[1:39:14] the things that we see, the things that
[1:39:17] we're affected by, if if if we see and
[1:39:21] and what we see
[1:39:26] are really negative things. The world is
[1:39:28] a negative place. Oh, people have a
[1:39:31] front. They have a facade, but because
[1:39:33] you're a believer, you see through it.
[1:39:36] and you see through it and you say
[1:39:38] that's not real.
[1:39:39] &gt;&gt; You see all this giddy laughing and joke
[1:39:41] and so on. They're not fooling anybody.
[1:39:45] &gt;&gt; See all this hilarity and you know
[1:39:48] everything and oh we're going to go and
[1:39:49] have a great time. You know they're not
[1:39:50] going to have a great time.
[1:39:54] &gt;&gt; You see the way people conduct
[1:39:55] themselves. You see the way people
[1:39:57] dress. You see the way they speak. You
[1:40:01] see the things they do. And for the
[1:40:04] believer, it's a very unwelcome place.
[1:40:09] &gt;&gt; And so, we see all of those things.
[1:40:11] Then,
[1:40:12] if we don't walk by faith and we see
[1:40:15] things that we've prayed for, things
[1:40:16] that we've desired, and we see this kind
[1:40:18] of go sideways, and we see that person
[1:40:20] go this way, and we see this friendship
[1:40:22] dissolve, we see this relationship turn
[1:40:24] sour, we see all these things. We come
[1:40:26] here into the house of God, and and you
[1:40:28] know, this is this is our best time.
[1:40:31] none of you should even come into the
[1:40:32] house of God and this one rubs me the
[1:40:34] wrong way and that one doesn't shake my
[1:40:36] hand and all all those are negative
[1:40:38] things
[1:40:40] but those are all things that you happen
[1:40:42] to be seeing in the visible world
[1:40:46] &gt;&gt; now friends I can tell you that this
[1:40:50] prophet messenger brother Brandham's
[1:40:52] life the thing that you so rejoice in
[1:40:55] did not come because a man looked at
[1:40:58] what he saw around
[1:41:00] is a man who looked into the unseen
[1:41:04] realm.
[1:41:05] &gt;&gt; And I I I just put down what what Moses
[1:41:08] what Paul has spoken of Moses and what
[1:41:11] he did. The Bible says
[1:41:14] that he refused.
[1:41:17] He refused. Now, here are some words I'm
[1:41:19] going to just deal with and then I'm
[1:41:21] going to go to one other scripture. In
[1:41:23] verse 24, he refused. In verse 25, he
[1:41:27] chose. In verse 26, he esteemed and he
[1:41:31] had respect under the recompense. In
[1:41:34] verse 27, he forsook Egypt. He was In
[1:41:38] verse 27 also, he did not fear. In verse
[1:41:42] 27 also, he endured. In verse 21, 28
[1:41:46] rather, he kept the Passover.
[1:41:48] And verse 29,
[1:41:51] by faith they passed through the Red Sea
[1:41:53] on dry land. He did all of those things
[1:41:56] because he saw him who was invisible.
[1:42:02] &gt;&gt; He refused. In other words, he had the
[1:42:04] right balance.
[1:42:07] &gt;&gt; Hey, I just think about this. I never
[1:42:11] really thought about it before.
[1:42:12] Yesterday, I was thinking about this. He
[1:42:15] refused to be called the son of
[1:42:20] Pharaoh's daughter.
[1:42:22] a woman who had him taken up
[1:42:25] &gt;&gt; and who loved him and cared for him and
[1:42:28] provided for him and wanted him to
[1:42:30] become the pharaoh
[1:42:32] &gt;&gt; wanted him to become the president, the
[1:42:34] king, the pharaoh of the superpower of
[1:42:37] the earth. And he came because he saw
[1:42:42] he had an impulse in him
[1:42:44] and he felt connected to something that
[1:42:47] was in another realm.
[1:42:50] And that impulse caused him to look at
[1:42:53] these mud
[1:42:54] &gt;&gt; dobbers
[1:42:56] &gt;&gt; and say, "They're my brothers
[1:42:58] &gt;&gt; and they're my sisters."
[1:43:00] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:43:00] &gt;&gt; The impulse that was in him caused him
[1:43:03] to look upon him who was invisible. And
[1:43:06] by seeing him invisible, he had his eyes
[1:43:09] fixed there.
[1:43:11] I refuse to be called the son of this
[1:43:14] woman.
[1:43:17] I refuse the grandeur
[1:43:20] and the power
[1:43:22] that his flesh would have liked to have
[1:43:24] accepted. I refuse it because he had his
[1:43:27] eyes in the right place
[1:43:31] and he did not fear.
[1:43:33] His fear left him
[1:43:36] and he chose
[1:43:38] because he had his eyes. He began to
[1:43:40] choose every one of us. I am I'm in
[1:43:44] constant I have to say myself I'm in
[1:43:46] constant concern
[1:43:48] over the congregation, over my friends,
[1:43:51] over my family. I'm in constant concern
[1:43:54] over the choices they make, over our
[1:43:57] young people. I just I pray I hope I
[1:44:01] trust to make the right choices
[1:44:04] because I know choices are so critical
[1:44:07] and the choices well you know when our
[1:44:09] choices when our choices come
[1:44:13] what do we base it on well we look at
[1:44:14] this and we look at that we look at this
[1:44:16] possibility we look at that we look at
[1:44:17] the paycheck we look at the education we
[1:44:19] look at the skills we look at what the
[1:44:20] potential is we look at what it's going
[1:44:22] to do for me and the whole thing is
[1:44:23] material material material material
[1:44:30] Quite frankly, I realize that we've got
[1:44:32] to take those things into consideration.
[1:44:35] But what should we really be looking at?
[1:44:37] We should be looking at him who's
[1:44:38] invisible.
[1:44:40] &gt;&gt; We should say, you say, "How do I do
[1:44:42] that, Brother Ed?" I say, "You, Almighty
[1:44:45] God,
[1:44:47] that brought this word,
[1:44:50] you that sent this phenomenal ministry,
[1:44:53] you I see you
[1:44:56] You sent it down. Even against the will
[1:44:58] of the man who spoke it. You sent it
[1:45:01] down. Somehow it went in its network and
[1:45:04] it reached me. I see you. You're the one
[1:45:08] that's going to guide me.
[1:45:09] &gt;&gt; You're the one that's going to tell me
[1:45:11] what to do. I'll make this choice, but
[1:45:13] if you direct me another way, I'm
[1:45:15] prepared to go another direction. I'm
[1:45:18] prepared. Whatever it is, I'm prepared
[1:45:20] to go your way. I'm looking at the
[1:45:22] invisible. Are you folks with me this
[1:45:24] morning? I'm looking at the invisible.
[1:45:29] &gt;&gt; I'm going to make my choices based on
[1:45:31] the invisible.
[1:45:34] &gt;&gt; You brought this word to me, Lord.
[1:45:37] You know, I I'm just going to tell you
[1:45:38] some personal things. Going to be
[1:45:40] careful to close soon.
[1:45:45] Up till just this last week,
[1:45:48] I have wondered why. And I've said to
[1:45:51] you, I've said to you here in this
[1:45:53] congregation, I do not know why I'm so
[1:45:56] affected
[1:45:58] when I hear
[1:46:01] what we call the second pull,
[1:46:03] the revealing of the secret of the heart
[1:46:06] of the people
[1:46:08] that all my life has gripped me so
[1:46:12] deeply.
[1:46:14] I'm so affected by it. And I will listen
[1:46:18] to the tape and my ear is there and I
[1:46:21] begin to weep and I say so often
[1:46:25] I know it's God. I feel him. I feel that
[1:46:28] impulse
[1:46:29] &gt;&gt; and I say
[1:46:31] why why did you do this?
[1:46:34] Why did you do this?
[1:46:37] &gt;&gt; What is the whole purpose of this? I
[1:46:39] know we could say well it's to attract
[1:46:41] the people, gather the people. But I see
[1:46:43] that demonstration over and over and
[1:46:46] over and I can hear that little prophet
[1:46:49] behind the pullpit and you can feel the
[1:46:51] atmosphere is filled with animosity and
[1:46:54] indignation and even hatred and yet he
[1:46:57] plows ahead and keeps preaching it,
[1:47:00] keeps preaching it. Why? is almost like
[1:47:03] a torturous thing he's going through
[1:47:05] especially towards the end and then
[1:47:07] he'll come at the end and start to call
[1:47:09] someone would it help you if I tell you
[1:47:12] your name Mrs. Holt.
[1:47:15] I was listening again. He was just
[1:47:18] coming to it. He said, "We're going to
[1:47:19] have the prayer line." You know what he
[1:47:21] said?
[1:47:23] Blessed me.
[1:47:25] He said, "The revealing of the secret of
[1:47:27] the heart is a greater miracle than if a
[1:47:30] got up out of the wheelchair."
[1:47:34] &gt;&gt; He said, "A might get up out of
[1:47:36] a wheelchair by mental faith."
[1:47:39] &gt;&gt; But he said, "You can never reveal the
[1:47:40] secret of the heart that way." It was
[1:47:43] God said, "It's a greater miracle." And
[1:47:46] I began to realize that God was there
[1:47:49] was an impulse within me. There's a
[1:47:51] greater miracle. God demonstrated for
[1:47:54] this people. And when you say within
[1:47:56] your heart, when you can say this
[1:47:58] morning, there's an unseen. There's an
[1:48:01] unseen realm and that realm has anchored
[1:48:04] in my heart. God has seized me.
[1:48:08] &gt;&gt; I've been seized. Hallelujah.
[1:48:11] &gt;&gt; I've been taken into a grip.
[1:48:14] Something fell upon me and I cannot
[1:48:18] change it.
[1:48:20] &gt;&gt; That's a glorious thing.
[1:48:22] &gt;&gt; You got the same thing Moses had.
[1:48:25] &gt;&gt; I cannot I refuse things because I see
[1:48:28] the unseen. I choose things because I
[1:48:31] see the unseen. I endure things because
[1:48:34] I see the unseen. Hallelujah. the same
[1:48:37] spirit that was upon him. I esteem
[1:48:40] things because I see the unseen. I have
[1:48:42] forsaken things because I've seen the
[1:48:45] unseen. I've kept the Passover. We've
[1:48:47] kept the feast. We kept the we keep the
[1:48:50] ordinances of God. Not because, well,
[1:48:52] the pastors said, "Well, we're going to
[1:48:54] have the Lord's table and foot washing."
[1:48:56] We keep it because we see the unseen.
[1:48:59] &gt;&gt; Oh, my brother, my sister, I'm preaching
[1:49:01] to you now. If we see the unseen, well,
[1:49:04] our harmony and our relationship in
[1:49:07] families and husbands and wives, when we
[1:49:10] see the unseen, it will be as God has
[1:49:13] ordained it.
[1:49:15] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:49:20] &gt;&gt; Think I have just about about eight or
[1:49:22] 10 minutes. I'm going to close.
[1:49:26] The Bible says
[1:49:30] that we should take any part out of the
[1:49:31] word or add add any part. Brother
[1:49:34] Brennham dwells on that a great deal
[1:49:39] and he calls it God's allotted
[1:49:42] and he says this
[1:49:45] uh give me slide six would you please?
[1:49:51] God in every age
[1:49:53] allotted his word from the beginning.
[1:49:56] And every time and every time in which
[1:50:00] one of those ages passed by, God sends
[1:50:02] down an anointed prophet for that age.
[1:50:06] In the days of Noah, days of all of the
[1:50:09] rest of them, when he made the promises,
[1:50:12] I don't care what kind of a condition
[1:50:14] the church got into, he always does
[1:50:17] that. He sends a man anointed for the
[1:50:20] word of the Lord comes to the prophet.
[1:50:23] And the next one, please. Next.
[1:50:27] We couldn't have Moses message. Moses
[1:50:30] couldn't have had Noah's message. We got
[1:50:33] the message of the hour. We couldn't
[1:50:35] have had Luther's message. We couldn't
[1:50:38] have had Wesley's message. This is
[1:50:40] another time God allotted his word to
[1:50:45] each age. Can the church agree and say
[1:50:48] amen?
[1:50:49] &gt;&gt; And as that age comes along, he sends
[1:50:53] someone there to vindicate that word to
[1:50:56] prove that it's true. We'll just hold
[1:50:59] that on the screen for a moment. This is
[1:51:02] what we are. This is what we are under.
[1:51:06] &gt;&gt; This is what has taken place.
[1:51:09] &gt;&gt; This is another time. And God has
[1:51:11] allotted his word to each age. And as
[1:51:15] that age comes along, he sends someone
[1:51:18] there to vindicate. So he has sent his
[1:51:20] messenger to vindicate. But now he sends
[1:51:23] a people. We are sent
[1:51:27] &gt;&gt; to receive it.
[1:51:30] &gt;&gt; And by receiving it, the Holy Spirit has
[1:51:33] fell upon us
[1:51:35] &gt;&gt; and seized us.
[1:51:37] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:51:38] &gt;&gt; To manifest the word that was
[1:51:40] vindicated.
[1:51:42] That's what you've been sent for. And I
[1:51:45] I feel a it's incumbent upon me to re to
[1:51:48] announce to this congregation, you and I
[1:51:51] don't care who you are. I don't care how
[1:51:52] weak you feel. I don't care what's
[1:51:54] happened to you. If the Holy Spirit has
[1:51:57] made real this word and has anchored it
[1:51:59] in your heart, then God has has brought
[1:52:03] you to this season because he's going to
[1:52:06] he has released his spirit upon you
[1:52:09] &gt;&gt; to live out the word. that he has sent
[1:52:12] to this generation. We cannot apologize
[1:52:14] for it. It's something that God has
[1:52:16] done.
[1:52:18] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:52:19] &gt;&gt; Just surrender to it. Just yield to it
[1:52:21] and confess it and say, "That's what I'm
[1:52:23] here for. And I'm looking to the unseen.
[1:52:26] The God that brought it here. The God
[1:52:28] who sent the messenger. The God who
[1:52:31] vindicated it. The God who brought me
[1:52:34] all down through the centuries. who
[1:52:37] brought a a seed together and brought
[1:52:40] parents together, brought man and woman
[1:52:43] together and brought me on the scene at
[1:52:46] this time for a specific purpose. I have
[1:52:49] receive this word and now a power has
[1:52:52] been released upon me.
[1:52:57] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:52:59] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:53:00] &gt;&gt; I haven't got time to read it, but it's
[1:53:03] in Don't turn to it now. I'll just go
[1:53:06] over the account.
[1:53:09] There's a woman.
[1:53:12] She's the widow of Zerapath.
[1:53:15] She's a Shunomite.
[1:53:18] And Brother Brham preaches on her and
[1:53:20] Elijah and the meal offering.
[1:53:23] I want you to listen real close as I
[1:53:25] come to a close.
[1:53:38] She thinks
[1:53:40] that she is dying and she has every
[1:53:42] reason to believe she's dying and her
[1:53:44] son is dying.
[1:53:46] And if you listen to that, brother
[1:53:47] Brandham tells it in a story form. It
[1:53:49] doesn't sound like a great deep message,
[1:53:52] but he says he starts out like I can see
[1:53:55] the sun is.
[1:53:58] It's just breaking of day.
[1:54:01] It's going to be another hot day. Sun
[1:54:04] burning down on that blistering desert.
[1:54:08] It's been no water or rain for three and
[1:54:10] a half years.
[1:54:12] And he says, the boy is crying in the
[1:54:15] night.
[1:54:18] Mama, isn't there just a piece of bread?
[1:54:21] Can you just get me something? His
[1:54:24] little gaunt frame.
[1:54:27] He said she's lived an honorable life.
[1:54:31] She's been an honorable woman.
[1:54:35] She rises and it's very early and leaves
[1:54:38] him there. And brother Brandham
[1:54:41] describes the whole night. Said she
[1:54:44] didn't get much sleep,
[1:54:46] maybe just a little bit here and a
[1:54:48] little bit there because of the child
[1:54:51] and her own gauntness.
[1:54:54] And and and she knows that death is upon
[1:54:56] them.
[1:54:57] and she goes out
[1:55:00] and she's going to find just two sticks.
[1:55:04] Now, while she's doing this,
[1:55:09] God has already spoken to the servant,
[1:55:12] &gt;&gt; the man of God, Elijah. God has already
[1:55:15] spoken to him
[1:55:17] and told him, "You go,
[1:55:20] for I have commanded
[1:55:24] a woman
[1:55:27] to feed you.
[1:55:29] I've commanded her." When she was
[1:55:32] listening to her son, she was listening
[1:55:35] to those dying whimpers.
[1:55:38] She was already under a commandment to
[1:55:41] live.
[1:55:44] She thought everything
[1:55:46] &gt;&gt; the world's turned against God's turned
[1:55:49] against me.
[1:55:51] &gt;&gt; The weather, we haven't had rain. We're
[1:55:54] in a famine. People are dying
[1:55:57] everywhere. Animals dying everywhere. We
[1:56:00] have nothing. Everything's turned
[1:56:02] against us.
[1:56:04] &gt;&gt; We're in the judgment of God. God must
[1:56:06] be very, very displeased. and I'm caught
[1:56:09] in it
[1:56:12] and I must go.
[1:56:15] And while she's walking out, excuse me
[1:56:17] for demonstrating it, but she walks out.
[1:56:22] There's not much wood. She finds two
[1:56:25] sticks.
[1:56:30] When she picks them up, she's actually
[1:56:32] picked up the emblem of the cross.
[1:56:36] Brother BM said couldn't be three. It
[1:56:37] had to be two.
[1:56:39] &gt;&gt; It was two sticks
[1:56:41] and it pointed to the cross.
[1:56:45] And she had just a little bit of oil and
[1:56:50] a little bit of meal and the meal was
[1:56:53] the word
[1:56:55] and the oil was the spirit. She had just
[1:56:57] a little bit left. But she was under a
[1:57:00] commandment to live and she thought, "I
[1:57:04] am dying. My son is dying. We're going
[1:57:08] to expire in just a short time. But she
[1:57:11] doesn't realize that while she walks and
[1:57:12] while she's looking and while she's
[1:57:14] coming back, she's under a commandment.
[1:57:18] &gt;&gt; Something has been released upon her.
[1:57:21] &gt;&gt; But she doesn't know it. Right.
[1:57:24] &gt;&gt; And I felt so urgent to say to this
[1:57:26] congregation, you're white waiting your
[1:57:29] way through the darkness of Leodysia,
[1:57:31] through the deception of this age,
[1:57:34] through the dreadful time. There's never
[1:57:35] been an age like this age, and you're
[1:57:37] trying to make your way through it. It's
[1:57:39] a it's a treacherous time. But I say to
[1:57:42] you, in the name of the Lord, you're a
[1:57:44] power has been released upon you.
[1:57:47] Hallelujah. And you shall come to a
[1:57:49] resurrection. You shall come to a
[1:57:51] rapture. That is thus says the word of
[1:57:53] God. You've been called to it and God
[1:57:56] has sent a message to you and God has
[1:57:58] vindicated the message to you and you
[1:58:00] can do nothing else but make it.
[1:58:05] &gt;&gt; That's the word of God.
[1:58:09] &gt;&gt; And while she went about the things that
[1:58:11] she could see, she could see her son.
[1:58:14] She could see the little place she was.
[1:58:15] She could see the sky. She could see the
[1:58:18] sun. The things that were seen are
[1:58:21] temporal.
[1:58:23] &gt;&gt; She didn't realize that she was under a
[1:58:25] power.
[1:58:27] &gt;&gt; Strange power.
[1:58:30] She hears a voice.
[1:58:33] Woman.
[1:58:36] Brother Bren says she turned around saw
[1:58:39] a man kind of hairs hanging down. Said
[1:58:42] there was something about him. He was
[1:58:46] something kind about him.
[1:58:50] just get me a little water.
[1:58:55] Asking her for water. Haven't had rain
[1:58:58] for three and a half years. Water is
[1:59:00] such a precious commodity. But God was
[1:59:03] going to test her.
[1:59:06] &gt;&gt; And there was just something about that
[1:59:08] voice
[1:59:11] that God had come to her because she was
[1:59:13] such a quality within. She starts to go
[1:59:15] for the water. said, "Just excuse me a
[1:59:18] moment.
[1:59:20] Would you mind bringing a little morsel
[1:59:21] of bread with
[1:59:26] sir?
[1:59:27] Only have a little handful of meal. My
[1:59:31] situation is dust and a little bit of
[1:59:33] oil to mix with it.
[1:59:36] And my son is laying in there dying
[1:59:40] and I'm going to give it to him.
[1:59:42] We're going to die.
[1:59:46] Nevertheless,
[1:59:48] she went.
[1:59:50] And now while she's going, he says, "I
[1:59:54] say unto thee." Oh, he said, "It's the
[1:59:57] words that it's the words that we long
[1:59:59] to hear. Thus saith the Lord."
[2:00:04] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. We're not interested. Thus
[2:00:06] sayith the great man. Thus sayith
[2:00:07] somebody. Thus saith the Lord. The
[2:00:11] barrel of meal shall not fail. And the
[2:00:14] cruise of oil shall not waste away. It
[2:00:17] shall not fail. It's thus sayeth the
[2:00:20] Lord. And my brother, my sister, we
[2:00:22] don't have we're not following enticing
[2:00:25] things of man's wisdom. We've had thus
[2:00:28] sayeth the Lord. That's one thing I can
[2:00:30] say from message to message. It's thus
[2:00:32] sayith the Lord. And those things that
[2:00:34] have so gripped my own heart and soul.
[2:00:37] The greatest of miracles have revealed
[2:00:38] the secret of the heart. And that great
[2:00:40] miracle came to you and revealed the
[2:00:44] secret of your heart. And you you have
[2:00:47] accepted it and received it. And if you
[2:00:49] haven't, I urge you to do so today.
[2:00:52] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:00:52] &gt;&gt; And follow that impulse. Say, "Oh God,
[2:00:56] tell me friends, what would you lose?
[2:00:58] What would a man or woman, what would a
[2:00:59] young person lose by saying, I'm going
[2:01:01] to follow that impulse from an unseen
[2:01:04] realm? It will bring you to life. It
[2:01:06] will bring you to eternal life. I'm
[2:01:09] proud. I'm thankful for you that have.
[2:01:11] Don't ever let Satan tell you a lie.
[2:01:13] Don't ever believe his his deceit. Don't
[2:01:15] ever believe it'll take you on a wrong
[2:01:18] track. Don't look at the things that are
[2:01:20] around you.
[2:01:24] &gt;&gt; Say, "Oh, my friends. What friends?
[2:01:27] &gt;&gt; Who's going to be here 150 years from
[2:01:29] now?"
[2:01:30] &gt;&gt; Then what friends?
[2:01:31] &gt;&gt; My job. What job?
[2:01:34] &gt;&gt; What are you going to have when when the
[2:01:35] strength is gone from your body? And
[2:01:37] what are you going to have when you get
[2:01:38] as old as I do? What are you going to
[2:01:40] have unless we are unless we're
[2:01:42] connected, hallelujah, by an inside
[2:01:44] impulse and inspiration to the unseen
[2:01:47] realm. While we look not at the things
[2:01:49] that are seen, but the things which are
[2:01:51] unseen. If God gives you things that are
[2:01:53] seen, fine. Whatever God chooses to do,
[2:01:55] may he gives and he takes away. I say
[2:01:57] blessed be the name of the Lord.
[2:02:00] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:02:01] &gt;&gt; Yes, Lord.
[2:02:04] May we be
[2:02:06] our hearts made ready.
[2:02:09] Dear father,
[2:02:13] in the somnity of this moment,
[2:02:17] we hear and we read about
[2:02:20] both men and women.
[2:02:22] And I was so particularly moved a widow.
[2:02:29] How your prophet said she must have been
[2:02:30] a young woman
[2:02:34] and she was keeping herself to meet her
[2:02:38] mate on the other side.
[2:02:41] Oh God,
[2:02:44] you came to her and while she was
[2:02:47] struggling with the visible in the
[2:02:49] scene,
[2:02:50] she didn't realize it, but she was
[2:02:52] already under a commission
[2:02:55] for life.
[2:02:57] Life. She was being moved by the power
[2:03:00] of life.
[2:03:02] Father God,
[2:03:04] Father God, my dear father,
[2:03:07] look upon us here today. Look upon each
[2:03:10] person that is in their homes, in their
[2:03:12] rooms, in their gatherings, Lord, that
[2:03:15] may be streaming at this time. And may
[2:03:18] they confess openly. May they say it and
[2:03:22] make a verbal statement. I have been
[2:03:25] called of God. I have heard his voice. I
[2:03:30] have responded to it. I have heard the
[2:03:33] vindicated message of God. I have heard
[2:03:37] thus sayaeth the Lord. I've heard it not
[2:03:39] merely in my ears but down. It has
[2:03:42] resonated in my soul. And now I am here
[2:03:46] this morning confessing, oh God, that
[2:03:49] I'm being moved by a strange force
[2:03:53] called the power of life. Many times I
[2:03:55] haven't realized it, but I want to
[2:03:57] recognize it this morning. It is you, oh
[2:04:00] Lord. It is you that has guided my
[2:04:03] footsteps. It is you that have brought
[2:04:05] me to this hour. And I give all that I
[2:04:08] am or ever can be to you and to your to
[2:04:13] the blessing of your kingdom and to the
[2:04:17] furtherance of it. Jesus, I pray that
[2:04:20] you will just take every person here and
[2:04:24] seize us. That one that has not been
[2:04:27] seized, seize them. That one that has
[2:04:30] not been filled with the Holy Spirit,
[2:04:33] seize them. Let the Holy Spirit fall
[2:04:35] upon them. The name of Jesus Christ.
[2:04:40] Hallelujah.
[2:04:43] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. I wonder if there's someone
[2:04:45] here that is in special spiritual need
[2:04:48] and you want to just raise your hand.
[2:04:51] Say, "Remember me."
[2:04:53] Special spiritual need.
[2:04:58] All right.
[2:05:02] Thank you, Father.
[2:05:05] Father, with these hands raised,
[2:05:08] may just keep them up before God.
[2:05:12] Hearts that are honest,
[2:05:16] hearts that are desperate before you,
[2:05:20] seeking spiritual guidance,
[2:05:23] seeking to know what you'd have them to
[2:05:26] do,
[2:05:28] seeking, oh God, that you would make
[2:05:30] yourself known and reveal yourself to
[2:05:32] them in a much deeper way.
[2:05:37] Let this morning be a morning, Lord. Let
[2:05:39] it be a milestone in their lives.
[2:05:43] Oh almighty God,
[2:05:47] you've been present with us today. You
[2:05:51] have a purpose.
[2:05:53] You have a plan for your people. And I
[2:05:57] pray that it will be fulfilled.
[2:06:00] And no obstacle, Lord, will be able to
[2:06:03] detain your people or hinder them in any
[2:06:05] way.
[2:06:07] Move mightily, oh God. Put within the
[2:06:10] hearts of the people, especially those
[2:06:12] of the younger of the younger group, oh
[2:06:15] God. Put a such a zeal within them, such
[2:06:18] a determination within them. Make them
[2:06:21] fearless
[2:06:22] &gt;&gt; for the glory of God. May they be the
[2:06:25] fearless men and women, young men and
[2:06:28] young ladies that you've spoken of in
[2:06:31] Jesus Christ's name.
[2:06:34] Amen.
[2:06:37] Hallelujah.
[2:06:45] Hallelujah.
[2:06:53] I want to
[2:06:55] I want to turn and sing. 22:45.
[2:07:01] in the great triumphant mourning.
[2:07:05] You can stand if you will please.
[2:07:08] The reason I chose this song was
[2:07:12] this is what we've been called for.
[2:07:16] Is what you've been called for.
[2:07:21] Can you imagine
[2:07:24] the multitude that you're going to sh
[2:07:25] you're going to rub shoulders with this
[2:07:27] weekend are headed for a great
[2:07:30] tribulation.
[2:07:33] &gt;&gt; There's things that move things of foot
[2:07:36] in the world today and I see those
[2:07:38] things and I I have no desire to remain
[2:07:43] here while those things are in effect.
[2:07:45] Those of you that got young families,
[2:07:47] you want to thank God the children that
[2:07:50] you're raising up are raised under under
[2:07:53] the shadow,
[2:07:54] under the glory cloud, under the pillar
[2:07:58] of cloud, under the pillar of fire. You
[2:08:00] want to thank God for that? Hallelujah.
[2:08:05] Do you believe what I've said this
[2:08:06] morning?
[2:08:07] &gt;&gt; God has allotted a certain portion of
[2:08:10] this word to you. Listen, the plagues,
[2:08:14] that was Moses' part.
[2:08:18] The Exodus, that was Moses' part. No one
[2:08:20] else could do that. That was his part.
[2:08:23] &gt;&gt; Mount Carmel, that was Elijah's part.
[2:08:25] That was his part.
[2:08:27] Peter in the fishing boat, that was his
[2:08:29] part. Catching 154 fish or whatever it
[2:08:32] was, that was his part. I wasn't there.
[2:08:34] I couldn't do it. You weren't there.
[2:08:37] [Music]
[2:08:39] 120. That was their part.
[2:08:42] &gt;&gt; That was their part and they did it
[2:08:46] &gt;&gt; and they were ordained to it.
[2:08:48] &gt;&gt; They did it and then the many others and
[2:08:51] then from then on how it spread on that
[2:08:54] was their part.
[2:08:57] I say to you unequivocally
[2:08:59] there is a certain allotment
[2:09:02] and God has sent that allotment down
[2:09:05] &gt;&gt; and released it.
[2:09:07] &gt;&gt; There's no doubt here it's been released
[2:09:09] has it? No doubt here in this
[2:09:10] congregation has been released and God
[2:09:13] brought you up out of the earth
[2:09:15] &gt;&gt; to meet that release of the word and to
[2:09:18] have received it and he has sent his
[2:09:21] spirit to make that word alive and
[2:09:23] quicken it to you.
[2:09:26] I adjure you in the name of Jesus
[2:09:28] Christ, do not allow the things that you
[2:09:32] see in this visible realm to affect
[2:09:36] that.
[2:09:39] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:09:41] &gt;&gt; I feel that, you know, Satan, he doesn't
[2:09:43] he doesn't he doesn't really like this,
[2:09:46] but I'm going to really lay it in. He
[2:09:48] doesn't want it. He's He's all taken up
[2:09:50] with this visible realm and we're to be
[2:09:53] we're not to be distracted by it.
[2:09:55] &gt;&gt; We live in it, but we're not of it.
[2:09:58] &gt;&gt; Amen. Use it up, but we're going to
[2:10:01] another place. We're going to another
[2:10:03] world.
[2:10:04] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:10:06] &gt;&gt; You'll be benefited by this service. I
[2:10:09] know you will.
[2:10:10] &gt;&gt; And if you need to hear it again, you
[2:10:12] can stream it again.
[2:10:16] Amen. Amen. And I've been very moved by
[2:10:18] this since I was in Africa, even till
[2:10:22] now.
[2:10:24] Hallelujah.
[2:10:25] In the great triumphant morning when we
[2:10:30] hear the bridegroom cry and the dead
[2:10:34] in Christ.
[2:10:37] Now we'll be changing
[2:10:43] [Applause]
[2:10:45] [Music]
[2:10:46] in the sky.
[2:10:49] We shall rise.
[2:10:52] We shall all
[2:10:55] him. The morning and the day Christ
[2:10:58] shall rise.
[2:11:01] We shall all rise to meet him. We shall
[2:11:05] all go to dreaming
[2:11:08] and we'll have a merry supper in the sky
[2:11:14] in the great triumph. But more what a
[2:11:17] happy time will be
[2:11:22] in Christ arise.
[2:11:24] [Applause]
[2:11:26] The Lord descends his glory. Sets him
[2:11:29] waiting children free. And we meet
[2:11:33] him in the sky.
[2:11:37] We shall all rise to meet him. We shall
[2:11:41] all go to greet him in the morning. When
[2:11:44] the dead in Christ shall rise,
[2:11:48] we shall
[2:11:51] shall
[2:11:53] greet him
[2:11:55] and shall have a merry supper in the
[2:11:59] sun. Now that sec that second verse
[2:12:02] spoke of him descending. He has
[2:12:05] descended.
[2:12:07] We don't question that at all.
[2:12:10] And if he didn't, he descended with an
[2:12:12] open book in his hand. So these saints
[2:12:14] were writing these songs prior to a lot
[2:12:17] of the things we've already experienced
[2:12:19] and we're not confused about that. Let's
[2:12:22] sing the last verse please. The fourth
[2:12:23] verse.
[2:12:25] In the great triumphant warning all the
[2:12:28] kingdoms will possess. Then the dead
[2:12:33] in Christ shall rise.
[2:12:36] Reign as kings and priests eternal under
[2:12:40] Christ forever blessed after me
[2:12:45] in the sky.
[2:12:47] We shall all rise to meet him. We shall
[2:12:51] all go to reach him the morning when the
[2:12:55] dead in Christ shall rise.
[2:12:58] We shall all rise to meet him. We shall
[2:13:03] all the great
[2:13:06] and shall have a merry supper in
[2:13:09] disguise.
[2:13:11] Somebody somebody has been ordained
[2:13:16] &gt;&gt; to experience the resurrection.
[2:13:20] &gt;&gt; And what I understand of this message
[2:13:23] that that had to prelude the actual
[2:13:26] physical resurrection of the saints.
[2:13:29] &gt;&gt; Somebody's going to meet him.
[2:13:32] Are you one of those?
[2:13:34] &gt;&gt; Grant it, Lord. Grant it. Oh my. I
[2:13:37] trust. I keep looking for them.
[2:13:39] &gt;&gt; Why shouldn't we?
[2:13:41] &gt;&gt; It's our part.
[2:13:43] &gt;&gt; Amen. Hallelujah.
[2:13:47] Amen. I'm just going to dismiss you.
[2:13:50] We've gone a little longer than we
[2:13:51] wanted to.
[2:13:54] Father, I pray that you will throughout
[2:13:57] this afternoon,
[2:13:59] I'm asking that there'll be a sweetness
[2:14:01] of your presence,
[2:14:04] a sweetness of the spirit of
[2:14:06] expectation.
[2:14:08] Expectation, Lord. And I do not know
[2:14:10] what our brother John Andy's will
[2:14:12] minister tonight,
[2:14:14] but I feel and sense, oh God, that
[2:14:17] you're setting this day aside to do a
[2:14:20] supernatural work, supernatural things
[2:14:24] in our lives.
[2:14:27] Lord, I'm so happy to see all that are
[2:14:30] here that are present.
[2:14:34] So thankful, Lord.
[2:14:37] so thankful.
[2:14:39] They're here, oh God, as trophies of
[2:14:41] your grace.
[2:14:44] They're here, oh God, as evidence of
[2:14:46] Satan's miserable defeat.
[2:14:49] &gt;&gt; And we give you praise over that. We
[2:14:52] thank you for the powerful power of the
[2:14:55] cross of Christ.
[2:14:58] Bless these people in the name of Jesus
[2:15:00] Christ. Dismiss us now.
[2:15:03] Amen.
[2:15:04] Amen.
[2:15:06] Hallelujah.
[2:15:08] &gt;&gt; Glory to God.
[2:15:11] &gt;&gt; I'm dismissing you in the name of our
[2:15:13] Lord Jesus Christ. But as I look down
[2:15:16] upon you, I tell you what, my soul, my
[2:15:18] heart is just throbbing.
[2:15:20] As I look across this congregation
[2:15:23] and think how how defeated Satan is.
[2:15:31] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[2:15:33] He delivered us from the power of
[2:15:35] darkness to the power of his light.
[2:15:38] &gt;&gt; From the power of death to the power of
[2:15:40] life.
[2:15:42] &gt;&gt; You people go. Don't forget these words.
[2:15:45] You are moving. Moving by the power of
[2:15:49] life.
[2:15:51] &gt;&gt; Amen. You're dismissed in Jesus name.
[2:15:54] God with you. Amen.
[2:16:00] God bless you, brother John.
[2:16:02] [Music]
[2:16:24] Heat. Heat.
[2:16:27] [Music]
[2:17:02] Hello.
[2:17:07] Good morning.
