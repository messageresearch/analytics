[0:00] circumstances
[0:02] you can't get through
[0:07] right now. It seems like there's no way
[0:11] out and you're going under.
[0:17] But God's proven time and time again,
[0:22] he'll take care of you.
[0:27] And he'll do it again. He'll do it
[0:31] again. He'll do it again. He'll do it
[0:36] again. If you just take a look at where
[0:41] you were now, where you are now,
[0:43] &gt;&gt; where you came,
[0:46] what hasn't he always come through for
[0:52] you?
[0:52] &gt;&gt; He's the same now as then.
[0:55] &gt;&gt; Don't you know God cannot?
[0:58] &gt;&gt; You may not know how. You may not know
[1:02] when, but he'll do it again.
[1:08] God knows the pain that you're going
[1:12] through and he knows how you're hurting.
[1:16] [Music]
[1:18] You see, he knows just how your heart
[1:23] has been broken into.
[1:28] But he's the God of the stars and of the
[1:31] sun and of the sea. And he is your
[1:35] father.
[1:38] He can come storm and find a way to fix
[1:44] it for you.
[1:47] And he'll do it again.
[1:50] &gt;&gt; He'll do it again.
[1:53] &gt;&gt; He'll do it again. He'll do it again.
[1:58] Just take a look.
[2:01] Where you are now, you are now where you
[2:07] [Music]
[2:08] always come through for you. He's the
[2:13] same now.
[2:15] &gt;&gt; Don't you know God cannot?
[2:18] &gt;&gt; You may not know how. You may not know
[2:22] when to do it again.
[2:27] Oh, he's still God.
[2:31] &gt;&gt; Yes, he's still God.
[2:33] &gt;&gt; He will not fail you.
[2:37] Oh,
[2:38] he's still God.
[2:43] He will not change.
[2:47] Oh, I know that he's
[2:51] [Music]
[2:53] fighting for you.
[2:56] Woo!
[2:58] Just like Moes. Just like Moses. Just
[3:01] like Daniel. Just like Daniel. Just like
[3:04] Shadow. Like,
[3:11] &gt;&gt; he'll do it again. He'll do it again.
[3:16] He'll do it again. He'll do it again. If
[3:21] you just take away where you are now,
[3:26] you are where you
[3:30] can always come through.
[3:35] &gt;&gt; He's the same now.
[3:38] &gt;&gt; Don't you know God cannot.
[3:41] &gt;&gt; You may not know how.
[3:43] &gt;&gt; You may not know how.
[3:45] &gt;&gt; And you may not know where. You may not
[3:49] know where. You may not know how. You
[3:53] may not know where.
[3:57] But I'm glad
[4:00] he'll do it again.
[4:04] Do it again.
[4:08] Do it again.
[4:11] [Applause]
[4:13] [Music]
[4:15] [Applause]
[4:23] Amen. Are you expecting this morning?
[4:27] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[4:31] &gt;&gt; This is uh we're turning to the word now
[4:33] as brother Ebiscll's coming. Let's just
[4:36] be praying. If you got a desire this
[4:39] morning,
[4:41] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[4:43] &gt;&gt; Bible says if you hunger and thirst
[4:45] after righteousness, you shall be
[4:46] filled. Amen.
[4:48] &gt;&gt; And I was sitting at a restaurant the
[4:49] other day and uh that's the waiter came
[4:52] up and said, "What's your what do you
[4:53] desire?" You know, and you know, if
[4:56] you're not hungry,
[4:59] not much. Right? But if you've come
[5:01] hungering and thirsting, say, "I'm
[5:03] really hungry. There's something on this
[5:04] menu that I want." Amen. And that's what
[5:08] we should be. You should be hungering
[5:09] and thirsting, desiring this morning to
[5:11] hear from God. Let's sing it. This is my
[5:14] desire to honor you, Lord, with all my
[5:17] heart. I worship you.
[5:19] [Music]
[5:25] This is my desire
[5:28] [Music]
[5:30] to honor
[5:33] you,
[5:36] Lord. With all my heart
[5:40] I worship you.
[5:43] [Music]
[5:47] All I have within me, Lord, I give you
[5:54] praise.
[5:58] All that I adore
[6:01] is in you,
[6:08] Lord. I give you my heart. I give you my
[6:13] soul.
[6:16] I live for you alone every day.
[6:22] As long as I
[6:27] have your way with me,
[6:33] Lord,
[6:35] this is my desire. I want to
[6:46] with all my heart
[6:49] I worship you.
[6:54] Lord,
[6:56] all I have
[7:00] for I give you praise
[7:05] for all that I know
[7:10] is
[7:11] [Music]
[7:17] Lord. I give you my heart.
[7:20] I give you my soul. Oh, I for you alone
[7:27] every day
[7:30] and I
[7:34] for your way.
[7:38] Lord, I give you my heart
[7:42] my soul.
[7:45] I live for you know every breath that I
[7:50] take. Every moment I
[7:56] have
[7:58] me.
[8:00] [Music]
[8:02] &gt;&gt; You sang that like you meant it.
[8:05] &gt;&gt; I believe it was from your heart.
[8:08] And anything that comes from our heart,
[8:10] God's going to honor that. Hallelujah.
[8:16] wonderful day that the Lord's given us.
[8:19] Sunshine outside. And for all of those
[8:21] that are uh streaming, we want them to
[8:25] know it's not raining here. We're
[8:29] enjoying the sunshine outside and we're
[8:31] enjoying the sunshine inside.
[8:35] &gt;&gt; God bless you each one. Isn't it
[8:38] wonderful to serve a living Christ,
[8:41] &gt;&gt; living gospel?
[8:43] Amen.
[8:45] Our I heard our brother Randy Snow was
[8:48] here. Where's Brother Randy do? Oh,
[8:53] brother Randy, you sent me an email to
[8:57] uh in thanking the people. Why don't you
[9:00] come down and
[9:03] you're here in the flesh? Wouldn't it be
[9:05] better that he would do it than me? I
[9:07] think so.
[9:12] Brother Randy, sister Lori along with uh
[9:16] their family and and friends and
[9:19] believers there in Phoenix have been
[9:21] praying earnestly for their daughter
[9:23] Amanda and we've been uh staying very
[9:27] very close of course with them while
[9:29] she's gone through this time. Cancer
[9:33] struck her body and uh uh there just
[9:37] been some developments this week. So, I
[9:40] thought that brother Randy, it would be
[9:42] good for him to come. He just wanted to
[9:43] thank the Just Come on, Brother Randy,
[9:45] and you say what's on your heart.
[9:50] I know you won't forgive me for this for
[9:52] a day or two, but I'll we'll get even.
[9:58] I don't scrap with this fellow.
[10:06] &gt;&gt; You caught me off guard. Get up close. I
[10:09] just sent an email to brother Ed. Uh,
[10:12] you know, my daughter went through, uh,
[10:19] you know, cancer stuff. Anyway, long
[10:22] story short, um
[10:26] God he God healed her, you know, even
[10:29] though she had to get the operation and
[10:31] stuff, but Thursday they took her poured
[10:34] out, which is some kind of thing, but
[10:36] they they they needle her and give her
[10:40] blood, give her test and everything. And
[10:43] so anyway, it's done.
[10:46] So they say she they they won't tell her
[10:48] she's 100%
[10:51] They say she's in remission and they got
[10:54] to check her every year and so on, but
[10:56] we're saying that she's done and it's
[10:58] history. So, I want to thank everybody
[11:01] for praying
[11:11] &gt;&gt; and take our love and greetings uh back
[11:14] also to Sister Lori and to Amanda. We're
[11:18] so happy, delighted.
[11:22] Uh at the
[11:24] last meeting in
[11:27] in Bell Horizante,
[11:30] uh they brought a man up. I just
[11:32] finished preaching. Just just finished
[11:35] sat down. They only have two chairs on
[11:37] the platform. And just sat down. And the
[11:41] pastor came forward
[11:44] and he was
[11:47] I guess uh I should say inspired very
[11:52] inspired and
[11:54] many times during the preaching of the
[11:56] word he'll come up and join me at the
[11:58] pullpit let the people know he's in
[12:01] support of that what's being said.
[12:04] Didn't want any mistake. Sometime he
[12:06] came around kind of to the front and
[12:08] almost like he's preaching at me. So I
[12:10] just kept on going. I thought if he's
[12:13] happy and the people are happy then God
[12:15] must be happy and we're all happy. And
[12:18] uh so
[12:21] apparently he said under the inspiration
[12:25] he spoke under the inspiration that a
[12:28] man would walk in three days.
[12:32] And they there was a man there
[12:35] uh and they began to bring him down a
[12:37] very crowded aisle. There was a lot of
[12:39] people there and I just looked around
[12:42] the side of the pulpit. They said they
[12:45] were bringing this man forward for
[12:47] prayer
[12:49] and uh there were several men probably
[12:51] four men uh helping him. He could not
[12:55] walk. In fact is I don't think his legs
[12:58] were even really touching the floor. And
[13:01] there were many other men probably six
[13:04] or eight around him and ministers came
[13:06] and prayed for him. We just received
[13:09] this email. Brother Tony forwarded it to
[13:11] me and it's from a brother in the
[13:14] church. I believe he plays in the
[13:16] orchestra. He said, "You asked me about
[13:20] that testimony of that crippled man for
[13:23] who the pastors prayed on Sunday in the
[13:27] morning. He wasn't a Christian. Just his
[13:30] mother is a true Christian and belongs
[13:33] to our church. Her name is Selena,
[13:37] an old woman.
[13:39] He is a deacon's neighbor.
[13:43] And last Wednesday, they phone to tell
[13:46] me that he was walking to every place
[13:49] and he will be baptized Sunday. That's
[13:52] today.
[13:58] Amen.
[14:02] He said, "Tomorrow I will send you an
[14:04] email with the complete history."
[14:07] Now, we try to be uh as careful as
[14:11] possible, but it's important that we
[14:13] share some of these things with you that
[14:17] uh need to be prayed and held up in
[14:20] prayer because right even today while we
[14:23] sit here, there's uh real crises and
[14:26] critical things are happening in China.
[14:29] You must understand and I hope that you
[14:32] fully realize or as fully as possible
[14:36] that little building that sits out in
[14:39] our parking lot is actually a nerve
[14:42] center
[14:43] for the work in China. You can't
[14:46] possibly grasp what is happening. Uh
[14:50] translations are going back and forth
[14:53] from there to China. They are
[14:56] translating in China. They're being
[14:58] proof read in that building. The proof
[15:00] read copies are going back and forth
[15:02] until they're until they're ready for
[15:05] print. They're made onto discs and made
[15:08] ready for books. They're put up on the
[15:10] internet so that people anywhere in
[15:13] China can bring them down, can read
[15:15] them, can can uh print them out on
[15:18] little pieces of paper. And they've said
[15:20] it's better if it's on pieces of paper
[15:22] like this rather than in a in a in a
[15:25] book because if it's in a book then it's
[15:28] considered a formal book, a formal
[15:30] teaching and that could be considered
[15:33] much more uh on the illegal side or or
[15:37] uh you know something that would be uh
[15:41] uh as opposed to the or be restricted.
[15:46] But this is not so restricted because if
[15:48] it's like this, it's considered more for
[15:49] your personal use, not for public
[15:52] distribution.
[15:53] So they can print it. And all of this is
[15:57] happening, but it's causing such a stir.
[16:00] And then in those brethren that go uh uh
[16:04] go over there and minister and go up
[16:06] into the different areas, they have then
[16:10] they have the backup, the support
[16:12] because they can tell them, you know,
[16:14] this isn't only what I'm preaching, but
[16:15] now you can go on the internet and you
[16:17] can you can pull this down and you can
[16:19] hear these messages and brother Murphy
[16:21] has getting close to a hundred that are
[16:24] voice over. Uh, brother Bram's message
[16:27] is voice over so they can hear and
[16:29] there's about 160 or more messages that
[16:32] have been translated. Now, you'll
[16:36] understand more when the service is
[16:39] over, Lord willing, what is what this
[16:42] all means, but this is a a nerve center
[16:45] that is that is right here on our
[16:47] parking lot. And I thank God that we can
[16:51] all have some part of what's taking
[16:54] place.
[16:56] Aren't you happy? Aren't you glad before
[16:59] God? We we we only have one life. And
[17:02] it's just what we do for God. That's
[17:04] what really counts. And in this letter,
[17:07] uh, Brother Murphy, you won't have to
[17:09] worry. I'm not going to expose any
[17:11] names, but
[17:14] um because brother Murphy right now is
[17:17] translating everything I'm saying into
[17:19] Chinese and so every service is
[17:22] translated. He's sitting in my study
[17:24] translating it at this moment.
[17:27] But there is a province
[17:29] uh
[17:31] where it is called the cradle of uh
[17:34] Chinese communism
[17:36] and it's a very strict and backward
[17:39] communist center.
[17:41] Then God sent a revival because a
[17:44] brother had traveled through there and
[17:45] had ministered for several months. And
[17:48] they sent a uh God sent a revival in
[17:52] those places and there were about
[17:56] 200 to 250 people baptized.
[18:00] A minister who was a member of a local
[18:04] three self church. The three self church
[18:06] in China is the only uh government
[18:11] recognized church and it doesn't have
[18:14] any real specific strict doctrine. It's
[18:16] just kind of a homogenized thing. So it
[18:19] doesn't offend anyone and doesn't offend
[18:21] the government of course and and and
[18:24] anyone anyone who believes anything in
[18:27] God or Christianity uh usually goes to
[18:30] that church. But a minister who was a
[18:33] member of the local three self church
[18:36] headquarters uh came to this message and
[18:41] all his whole church too. He is a very
[18:46] influential person in the area and many
[18:49] churches invited him to minister to
[18:52] their group both self and the home
[18:55] church. They have little groups in
[18:57] homes. after he was converted. It caused
[19:01] a tremendous stir in that area. Even the
[19:05] chairman of the three self church has
[19:08] interested in this message because many
[19:11] people were healed. Uh there as they
[19:16] they as they preach this message people
[19:19] who were paralyzed and death and cancer
[19:24] all healed by God miraculously.
[19:28] All the sisters threw away their pants
[19:31] and wear dress. Actually, we donated all
[19:35] addresses for them. And lots of things
[19:38] happened over the past few months. Even
[19:40] some elders in the three self church
[19:43] request that all the churches in this
[19:46] town need to baptize the people in the
[19:49] name of the Lord Jesus Christ from this
[19:51] year.
[19:52] &gt;&gt; Amen. Now the three self church
[19:54] headquarters in this town calls some
[19:57] ministers from another city which is
[20:00] considered the Jerusalem in China for
[20:04] most of the people there are Christian
[20:07] to hold a Bible study for all the
[20:10] ministers in this town maybe in brackets
[20:14] a dispute about the strange doctrines
[20:16] they've heard. There were there are
[20:19] going to be a big convention for all the
[20:23] ministers in this brother's town on next
[20:26] Monday the 28th and I believe that's
[20:30] today tomorrow. More than 200 ministers
[20:34] in this area from almost 100 churches
[20:38] both three self and registered home
[20:41] church will attend this convention and
[20:45] this brother might have a chance to
[20:48] share what he believes this time. So we
[20:52] ask if we can pray for him earnestly. So
[20:55] that the Lord will give him a bold heart
[20:58] to share this message even if there is a
[21:01] resistance as we know it is very
[21:04] dangerous for this brethren now for they
[21:06] knew they know what he believes. It
[21:09] might cause him to be persecuted.
[21:13] And then we have also from another city
[21:17] the three self church called all the
[21:20] people who were baptized last time and
[21:24] threatened them and uh they have
[21:27] reported them to the police that's in
[21:29] another city where there has been a
[21:31] stir. So to say the least, friends, we
[21:34] sit here on a Sunday morning, beautiful
[21:38] day outside, but there's a great
[21:41] spiritual warfare going on. And I cannot
[21:44] impress upon you sufficiently while you
[21:47] sit here this morning and hearing uh and
[21:51] in participating in the worship and and
[21:55] however you came prepared for the
[21:57] service. But there's a great spiritual
[22:00] warfare and we're part of it. Amen.
[22:02] &gt;&gt; This is one body. It isn't them there
[22:05] and us here. It isn't brother Tony and
[22:08] those in Brazil and us here. It is one
[22:11] body. You believe that with all your
[22:13] heart and we are a part. And as I prayed
[22:16] before I came to the pulpit, I so can
[22:19] see these these people in China and how
[22:23] they will pull their little plastic
[22:25] chairs out of the closet and people well
[22:28] educated and and uh just the common
[22:31] people as well and they'll bring the
[22:33] little chairs out and sit and they'll
[22:36] sit so eager and they'll sit so long and
[22:39] they'll sit so attentively and listening
[22:42] and drinking in just every hanging on to
[22:45] every word. It's so marvelous. And and
[22:48] and there's a pressure every time
[22:51] there's a knock on the door and someone
[22:53] else is coming in. You don't know. We've
[22:55] been there. We've done that. My wife has
[23:00] gone through that. Sister Rebecca's gone
[23:02] through that. Others many times. You
[23:05] hear that knock and your heart just
[23:07] takes a flip because you just don't know
[23:09] who's coming through the door. And uh
[23:12] and and they're there. They're there.
[23:14] That's how they're meeting right now. We
[23:17] don't have that pressure. Sometimes I
[23:20] think it might be a do us a whole lot of
[23:23] good if we did have some pressure and it
[23:25] would make us appreciate one another and
[23:29] appreciate that our freedom and
[23:31] appreciate what it is that we have and
[23:34] the liberty that we have and the access
[23:37] that we have, the resources that we
[23:39] have. we would appreciate them a whole
[23:42] lot more. And and so we don't have to
[23:45] wait for a persecution. I believe that
[23:48] we can condition ourselves and say, "Oh
[23:50] God, I am thankful.
[23:53] I am grateful. I do appreciate and I do
[23:57] respect it what you're doing amongst
[24:00] us." And it's so wonderful. God bless
[24:03] you all. I don't want to get preaching
[24:05] before I should be preaching.
[24:09] been in touch with brother with Rabbi
[24:12] Richmond
[24:13] and he Lord willing will be with us in
[24:16] May May 15th uh to the 17th those days
[24:23] he expects to be here the Lord willing
[24:26] his daughter now has been engaged to an
[24:29] officer in the IDF and they have just he
[24:34] just informed me this morning that
[24:39] uh the people that they are displacing
[24:41] that the Israeli government old soldiers
[24:46] who fought for the land are not merely
[24:49] giving the land away. They're displacing
[24:53] 8,500
[24:55] Jewish people who are third generation
[24:59] and they spilled their blood and lost
[25:01] their sons and their daughters to have
[25:04] the land and to build in the area which
[25:07] this Bible says is theirs.
[25:10] &gt;&gt; And now they're not merely being taken
[25:13] away by force. Jewish people, dragging
[25:18] Jewish people off of their inheritance
[25:22] and giving it back to their enemies and
[25:26] destroying the very buildings they built
[25:29] with their hands and sweat, blood, and
[25:31] tears. It is a it is something that is
[25:34] so incomprehensible that we can't hardly
[25:38] grasp it. And we look into the word just
[25:40] to see, you know, I say, God, what is
[25:43] happening? What is taking place? And
[25:45] Rabbi Richmond told me this morning that
[25:48] this another twist has come that a rich
[25:52] wealthy Arab has come forward and said,
[25:56] "Why destroy the buildings? Why destroy
[25:59] them? We will buy them from you." And so
[26:02] now they're seeking to actually purchase
[26:04] them and take legal ownership through
[26:07] buying. And I guess the Israeli
[26:10] government is considering it. I don't
[26:12] know. But I can tell you one thing. Our
[26:15] prophet said everything is ticking
[26:18] absolutely on time. And when we see
[26:21] these things happening, you can you can
[26:24] just be absolutely assured your
[26:26] homegoing, my homegoing is a lot closer
[26:30] than we thought before.
[26:33] &gt;&gt; Amen. Let's stand to our feet. Would you
[26:36] like to turn please in your Bible to
[26:39] First Peter the 2 chapter and we're
[26:44] going to read from verse one. Do you
[26:48] enjoy hearing a little bit of the news
[26:50] from other places? I'm sure you do.
[26:56] First Peter
[27:01] chapter 2. And before we read, let's
[27:04] just bow reverently in prayer.
[27:08] Oh gracious,
[27:10] loving and kind, merciful,
[27:14] long-suffering
[27:15] heavenly father,
[27:17] we're so unworthy, Lord. We don't even
[27:21] feel worthy to be called your children.
[27:24] But yet in your bosom and the great
[27:28] fountain
[27:30] of your love, oh God, you have reached
[27:34] out to us. You have reached out to your
[27:39] children. You have declared, "I will
[27:42] redeem them." And Lord, we see the very
[27:47] attributes of God were expressed in
[27:50] Jesus Christ. And as our sister Margaret
[27:53] sang and how I love that song, He'll do
[27:56] it again. You You have done it again.
[27:59] Thank you for the triple man you healed.
[28:02] Oh God, in Bella horizonty
[28:08] beyond physical work and what is taking
[28:11] place just now. We're praying for our
[28:13] brother Tony Lord at uh I believe is
[28:15] ministering right at this moment, an
[28:18] evening service. Oh God, pray that the
[28:21] Holy Spirit will drop like a glory cloud
[28:25] upon that congregation, upon the pastor,
[28:28] the deacons, and the musicians, upon the
[28:31] whole service. And pray you'll anoint
[28:33] our brother Tony. Strengthen him,
[28:35] Father. Pray you'll be with our brother
[28:37] Ernie wherever he is tonight. Lord, I
[28:40] ask, oh God, especially for the service
[28:43] now that we have responsibility for. I
[28:46] stand at the post of duty. Lord, we do
[28:49] not stand in human strength, but in the
[28:52] power of the Holy Spirit. And I pray
[28:54] you'll manifest that power to every
[28:57] believing heart and that you'll cast out
[29:00] every doubting demon in the name of
[29:03] Jesus Christ. Lord, I pray that every
[29:06] restriction and hindrance that might
[29:08] hinder the people, Lord, will be
[29:10] dispensed with, will be cast away, will
[29:14] make every spirit impotent, oh God, and
[29:17] cause them to be cast out. Lord, we pray
[29:20] you'll bless every person that now
[29:22] listens whatever part of the earth they
[29:25] are in or whatever time zone they're in.
[29:28] I ask that you'll meet the needs of the
[29:30] people. Bless us together, Father, in
[29:33] the name of Jesus Christ. And may the
[29:35] words that you have selected be the
[29:37] words that will be spoken. We give you
[29:40] praise in Jesus name. Amen.
[29:44] Read from verse one.
[29:47] Wherefore laying aside all malice and
[29:51] all guile and hypocrisies and envys and
[29:55] all evil speakings,
[29:57] as newborn babes, desire the sincere
[30:00] milk of the word, that ye may grow
[30:03] thereby.
[30:04] If so be ye have tasted that the Lord is
[30:07] gracious, to whom coming as unto a
[30:10] living stone, disallowed indeed of men,
[30:14] but chosen of God and precious. Ye also
[30:19] as living stones are built up a
[30:22] spiritual house, a holy priesthood to
[30:26] offer up spiritual sacrifices
[30:28] acceptable to God by Jesus Christ.
[30:32] Wherefore also it is contained in the
[30:35] scripture, behold, I lay in Zion a chief
[30:38] cornerstone, elect precious, and he that
[30:42] believeth on him shall not be
[30:44] confounded. Unto you therefore, which
[30:47] believe, he is precious. But unto them
[30:50] which are disobedient, the stone which
[30:52] the builders disallowed, the same is
[30:55] made the head of the corner, and a stone
[30:58] of stumbling, and a rock of offense,
[31:00] even to them which stumble at the word,
[31:03] being disobedient, where unto also they
[31:06] were appointed. But ye are a chosen
[31:09] generation,
[31:11] a royal priesthood,
[31:13] a holy nation, a peculiar people, that
[31:18] you should show forth the praises of him
[31:22] who hath called you out of darkness into
[31:25] his marvelous light.
[31:27] &gt;&gt; Amen. God bless you. You have your
[31:30] seats.
[31:34] Now, if I don't get done this morning,
[31:37] Brother Tom said, I could just continue
[31:39] this afternoon this at 5:00, which I may
[31:43] do because I I have I had these other
[31:46] things I needed to take and it takes
[31:48] about 15 minutes out of the service. So,
[31:51] I want you to be sure and kind of
[31:55] get into the burden that's on my heart.
[32:00] I had an unusual time in Brazil in some
[32:04] way. It was a very very busy, very busy
[32:08] time. It was as though our
[32:13] uh we had to have our running shoes on.
[32:16] We spent just so many hours in meetings
[32:19] and in study and uh ministers meetings
[32:23] and then the main services.
[32:25] But perhaps you're not as familiar with
[32:28] Brazil as I am now. And I certainly
[32:31] wasn't this familiar uh just a few days
[32:34] ago. But I thought I would do a little
[32:36] bit of study and because my message uh
[32:41] is a is a is a part of what I now have
[32:45] to say. Brazil
[32:48] is the fifth largest country in the
[32:51] world
[32:52] both in land mass and in population.
[32:58] It has a size of 3,287,195
[33:05] square miles. It's uh 8 8 12 million
[33:10] plus square kilometers.
[33:13] It's larger than the continental United
[33:15] States and it's the fifth largest nation
[33:19] in the world behind USA.
[33:22] The population of Brazil has a
[33:26] population of over 180 million
[33:29] and 55% are white, 38% are milatto, 6%
[33:36] are negro and 1% are other, Japanese,
[33:40] Arab, etc.
[33:43] The religion is 89%
[33:46] Catholic.
[33:48] The largest population in the world. The
[33:51] largest Catholic population in the world
[33:54] in a given country. Seventh day
[33:56] Adventist. It has the largest population
[34:00] in the world of Seventh Day Adventists.
[34:03] Jehovah's Witnesses. It has the second
[34:05] largest population in the world only
[34:08] behind the United States. and other
[34:10] religions including spiritist, Islam,
[34:14] Buddhist, Mormons, Assembly of God and
[34:18] others.
[34:20] The age distribution and this just give
[34:22] you a little quick overview of the
[34:24] country. The age distribution, the
[34:27] population below 20 years old is 46.7%.
[34:34] It's a very young nation. The church in
[34:38] Bellow Horizonte is a very very youthful
[34:42] church. Not many old people. Some places
[34:46] we go, it's full of old people. I felt
[34:49] so much at home at Bella Horizonti
[34:52] because there was so many young people
[34:55] and young families and young men and
[34:57] young women. It was just marvelous. And
[35:00] uh I thank God that we have been able to
[35:03] have the same. The literacy
[35:06] 83%
[35:08] of the total population of 15 years of
[35:12] age and over can both read and write.
[35:15] 83%.
[35:17] This is not a backward. As a country, it
[35:20] is rich in minerals.
[35:24] It has an educated population
[35:27] and all that is essential, I would say,
[35:30] for prosperity.
[35:32] And yet uh in one way they remain
[35:36] povertystricken.
[35:38] Uh it's a nation that has
[35:43] no I won't say no structure but has need
[35:47] of structure to channel its resources
[35:50] down to the people. And of course this
[35:53] is not uncommon. in fact is Brazil is a
[35:58] very upand cominging uh modern country
[36:02] but we have other countries where the
[36:05] situation is very very grave and we have
[36:08] a lot of uh a good number of our people
[36:11] here in this church from Congo. Now
[36:14] there are there are countries
[36:17] that the cost of their resources their
[36:21] resources not the cost of their
[36:23] resources but the wealth of their
[36:26] resources is being utilized for human
[36:29] suffering in that it is you used to pay
[36:33] for war. It's used and war has brought
[36:37] untold suffering to the people.
[36:41] uh in Congo for example and I had
[36:44] intended on reading this a little later
[36:46] on but it's uh appropriate at this
[36:48] moment
[36:50] the profits of this very wealthy country
[36:54] speaking of Congo now just for a moment
[36:56] are not invested back into the
[36:58] communities from where they came but
[37:02] rather are effectively looted by
[37:05] individuals and the majority of them are
[37:08] non congalles
[37:11] The UNICEF
[37:13] who concerns themselves with children
[37:16] estimates that there are currently
[37:19] between three and 3 and 12 million
[37:23] children aged between 6 and 11 who are
[37:27] not receiving any formal education.
[37:32] Now I just you'll be thinking of this on
[37:34] a spiritual level in a few moments.
[37:36] Further, it is widely reported that the
[37:40] substantial tax revenue on minerals is
[37:43] actually financing war. When we think
[37:46] about war, soon as we say war, you can
[37:49] just say suffering and children and
[37:53] orphans and lack of food and all of
[37:56] these things which are taking place.
[37:58] It's it is financing war rather than the
[38:02] development of services for people. that
[38:04] behind the figures lies a human tragedy.
[38:09] Now this is not just statistics but
[38:11] these statistics represent people like
[38:15] you. You that are parents sitting here
[38:18] today, you should look at your child or
[38:22] recall in your mind your children. And I
[38:26] can assure you, your babies
[38:29] and your children
[38:32] and your wife and your husband doesn't
[38:35] mean one bit more to you than it does to
[38:38] somebody over there. your friends and
[38:42] those that you're sitting with today
[38:44] doesn't mean one bit more. It can't. And
[38:47] as a prophet would say so often, they
[38:50] love their children.
[38:52] They love their children. They They have
[38:55] their families. They have their ties.
[38:58] and the tragedy in human tragedy. The
[39:02] war is likely to have cost over 2
[39:05] million
[39:07] lives in just the last 3 years. Now, I
[39:11] want you to think about this, friends.
[39:13] You that live here in the lower mainland
[39:15] and this Pacific Northwest, this would
[39:19] be like someone giving a sentence and
[39:21] saying, "Empty out this entire lower
[39:25] mainland."
[39:27] and slay every person in the next 36
[39:31] months.
[39:33] &gt;&gt; That is what has happened. And finance
[39:35] it by the timber and by the fishing and
[39:39] by the resources and the people don't
[39:42] get it. We don't get any benefits.
[39:44] Forget your hospitals and forget your
[39:46] schools and forget everything else. This
[39:48] is going to finance some uh warlords and
[39:52] rebel people who who have greed in their
[39:55] heart and a few will get perhaps rich
[39:58] off of it and they will protect
[40:00] themselves with armies and pay for guns
[40:02] and bullets and all of these things and
[40:05] you won't have any of that and all these
[40:07] people are going to die as a result of
[40:09] it in the next 36 months. That is the
[40:12] Congo,
[40:13] &gt;&gt; right?
[40:15] And these brothers and sisters that are
[40:17] sitting here know what I'm talking about
[40:19] and they know it is the truth. And our
[40:22] nations, America and Canada and other
[40:25] nations as well have accepted and
[40:28] received many of the people on a refugee
[40:31] basis on other bases. And that is a a
[40:34] human tragedy
[40:37] because of greed, because of sin,
[40:40] because of of of wickedness that's in
[40:44] Satan's Eden at this time. But at the
[40:48] spiritual level,
[40:50] hear me, that power of Satan is no less
[40:57] relentless upon the body of Christ. And
[41:00] I can tell you there's one message he
[41:02] hates, and it's this one.
[41:04] &gt;&gt; And there are certain people that he
[41:06] hates, and it's the bride of Jesus
[41:08] Christ. He can't stand the very thought
[41:12] that there is a virtuous woman that he
[41:15] can't get to. And he's doing everything
[41:18] he can to get at her and to sew his
[41:21] seeds of of dissension and darkness and
[41:24] doubt and suspicion and everything that
[41:27] he can to every crack and crevice and
[41:30] cranny and every mind and every thought.
[41:32] He's there to He's there to uh show his
[41:36] own ideas and his own reasoning right
[41:38] amongst the bride of Jesus Christ. And
[41:41] we have the power
[41:44] &gt;&gt; to resist him
[41:46] &gt;&gt; and to see that he does not do his
[41:48] destructive work
[41:50] &gt;&gt; amongst the believers.
[41:52] &gt;&gt; Do you believe it?
[41:58] In Congo, there's 2,000 doctors for a
[42:03] population of 50 million.
[42:09] You have trouble getting to a doctor
[42:11] here.
[42:15] You wouldn't get to one. 2,000 doctors
[42:18] for 50 million people.
[42:23] While I was in Brazil,
[42:28] I see the country. I see the people. I
[42:32] see that it's churches better than ours,
[42:36] larger.
[42:39] I see deacons, pastors, ministers,
[42:43] qualified,
[42:45] dressed nice, educated.
[42:52] They said
[42:55] the brother got up and he's he's
[42:57] probably got he's got a group of
[42:59] churches actually he's in charge of he's
[43:01] a pastor but he's also as far as we know
[43:05] the best translator in the country
[43:08] has three sons they speak English they
[43:11] work as a team his wife does corrections
[43:14] and so on and they work as a complete
[43:16] team and he's devoted himself for some
[43:18] years to you know to translate the
[43:20] message again. But he's a pastor. He's
[43:22] got a number of churches he's
[43:23] responsible for. His time is somewhat
[43:25] limited.
[43:28] I had a pastor come to me two years ago
[43:31] when we were in Chapelco
[43:33] and he he consulted with me and I didn't
[43:38] recall exactly the content of the
[43:41] conversation, but he reminded me this
[43:43] time, but he had a burden to do
[43:45] something for the message and I
[43:46] encouraged him to go forward. And so he
[43:48] started, he doesn't speak any English,
[43:50] but he had a brother that does
[43:52] apparently. And so they have started
[43:54] doing some translation work. And the
[43:57] first brother
[43:59] uh he does 5,000 of any copy that he
[44:02] does. And this brother in just the last
[44:03] 3 years started doing 2500.
[44:08] And uh
[44:10] so this the the first brother who is the
[44:13] most senior uh translator and pastor, he
[44:16] stood up. He's not the most senior
[44:18] pastor, but he's the most senior
[44:19] translator. He stood up at the
[44:21] minister's meeting and and I his son was
[44:24] interpreting for me and he was saying
[44:26] that, you know, brother Bisco, brother
[44:27] Adma have arrived. He said, "We really
[44:29] don't know what to do. Uh we uh we have
[44:33] called them and what they say is what
[44:36] we're going to do. They've got the
[44:38] agenda. They're going to take all these
[44:40] ministers meeting." I was sitting at I
[44:42] was sitting expecting to speak two
[44:44] sessions perhaps one today and one
[44:46] tomorrow and this m minister's meeting
[44:48] is is starting at 8:00 is going to run
[44:50] till 12 or 12 or 1:00 is 4 4 and 1/2
[44:54] hours long and then they're going to
[44:56] break in the afternoon and go into an
[44:58] evening session starting the next
[45:00] morning at 8:00 and run again till noon
[45:03] and then the next day we're having an
[45:05] evening service and the Saturday morning
[45:08] another minister's meeting and Saturday
[45:10] night
[45:11] public service and Sunday morning of
[45:13] public service. And after that, we met
[45:15] with some some other pastors on other
[45:17] issues. And he said, "Now, these
[45:20] brethren, they're going to take the
[45:22] they're in full charge of this meeting."
[45:25] I thought, I I thank God for Tony. He
[45:28] had had already God must have inspired
[45:30] him and he set an agenda and it was it
[45:33] was just the hand of God that that kind
[45:36] of gave us some direction. But I had
[45:38] some things on my heart and God began to
[45:40] move in a wonderful way. But I came
[45:43] forward and I just said to the pastors,
[45:46] I said, "How many message books have you
[45:49] received in the last year?"
[45:52] And everybody's hand went up. Four.
[45:56] Four.
[45:58] And after that meeting, they actually
[46:01] came to Brother Tony. I'd gone back to
[46:03] the hotel. They said, they told Brother
[46:06] Tony, it wasn't four in the last year.
[46:08] Really, it's four in the last two years.
[46:14] I I'm trying to assimilate this
[46:19] a country
[46:21] of a country of of of substance of
[46:25] resources.
[46:27] uh a people, a resourceful people,
[46:31] sound system as good as ours, marvelous
[46:34] musicians,
[46:35] singers, deacons, ministers,
[46:40] buildings.
[46:42] Another pastor came up and handed me a
[46:44] card, said, "I'd like you to come to my
[46:45] church dedication in August." I'm
[46:48] waiting another art way far to the north
[46:50] and he gave me a postcard with a picture
[46:52] of artist
[46:54] rendering of his church.
[46:57] architecturally nicer than anything I've
[47:00] ever laid eyes on. Beautiful big
[47:03] building.
[47:05] And uh
[47:08] I I I just started getting moved. I
[47:10] said, "How how does this happen? How
[47:12] many messages have you got?" Well, it's
[47:15] been about 300, but about 200 of them
[47:18] are bad.
[47:20] Oh, so they're they're not good because
[47:24] they're not complete. And the one who
[47:26] was in charge, very very senior man who
[47:29] was in charge, when he ran into
[47:31] something in the message he didn't agree
[47:32] with, he just left those portions out
[47:34] and continued on with what he was in
[47:37] agreement with. So I I'm beginning to
[47:39] see, you know, major major difficulties.
[47:42] And so that I said, well, why do you
[47:44] have anything to do with it? Oh, well,
[47:46] he's first generation.
[47:48] Excuse me. Well, he's first generation.
[47:51] What does that mean? Well, first
[47:53] generation and in their culture now we
[47:55] have a clash with culture in their
[47:58] culture in that country and I see
[48:01] brother Harter you must know something
[48:03] about this uh uh in that culture those
[48:07] that are first generation which are
[48:09] considered senior kind of first people
[48:12] to perhaps uh work uh in the area and
[48:18] minister the message even if they would
[48:21] go way into false doctrine or fall into
[48:24] sin, which apparently this man did. But
[48:28] he holds still over 200 ministers under
[48:32] his sway and they have such allegiance
[48:35] to him as like brother Brandham said a
[48:38] minister God prospers him and and the
[48:42] church grows and and then uh uh you know
[48:46] the people he becomes endeared to the
[48:48] people and so on so forth and he gets
[48:50] lifted up in himself and then he begins
[48:53] to feel brother says that he can get
[48:55] away with anything right?
[48:58] &gt;&gt; Begins to feel that way. And now we have
[49:01] problem number two is a you have a first
[49:05] generation have a clash of culture. I
[49:07] said to the people if a man is not
[49:10] giving you the full word and the true
[49:11] word, forget it. Move on in another
[49:15] direction. That's what I said two years
[49:17] ago. And so now I hope I'm going to be
[49:20] able to make myself clear. I I then then
[49:24] it was just like a realization of of the
[49:28] uh rich resourceful nation but I
[49:33] encountered something I never
[49:34] encountered before. And then God really
[49:38] spoke to me because it's a it's a real
[49:43] it's a danger even here.
[49:45] &gt;&gt; It's a danger anywhere. And that is that
[49:48] we become content
[49:50] &gt;&gt; with what we have. Amen.
[49:53] &gt;&gt; And they don't have even half, not even
[49:57] half or maybe not maybe not even a third
[50:01] of the message available to them. But
[50:04] they've the church is functioning. They
[50:06] come to church all the time. The meeting
[50:07] is there. The pastor will be there
[50:08] preaching. He'll preach a good service.
[50:10] Musicians are there. Everything is
[50:12] there. And what else do we need? Cuz
[50:16] this is going to go on next Sunday, next
[50:18] Wednesday. The meeting's going to be
[50:19] there. You know, we're going to be
[50:21] there. and God's going to do things and
[50:23] we're going to have, you know, the
[50:24] meeting's going to be uh enthusiastic
[50:27] and it's going to be exciting and we're
[50:29] going to worship and we're going to
[50:30] everything's going to happen and and uh
[50:32] there is no inner hunger or need. They
[50:37] don't see a need for more.
[50:40] &gt;&gt; And if we don't see a need for more, why
[50:42] exhaust yourself? And why sacrifice? and
[50:46] why go through all this exercise to get
[50:48] something that you know you don't feel a
[50:51] need of. And that is a tragedy.
[50:55] &gt;&gt; And there I begin to see
[50:58] I begin to see on the natural side
[51:01] nations rich in resources, but it's not
[51:05] getting to the people. God put the
[51:08] wealth there, but it's not getting to
[51:10] the people. And I just got so burdened
[51:14] in my own heart. Oh God, don't let us
[51:17] ever fall into that snare. Don't ever
[51:20] let us become at ease in Zion. Let us
[51:23] lay hold of everything that you've given
[51:26] us and all the wealth and all the riches
[51:29] that you have given us within the word
[51:32] of God and the unveiling of Christ at
[51:34] this time. Don't let us ever uh sit back
[51:37] as it were and be satisfied and we're
[51:40] just kind of content. I got my job and
[51:42] got my family. We got, you know, we got
[51:44] this and we got our our objective, our
[51:47] school. We got our agenda and we got our
[51:49] education. We got, you know, what what
[51:52] uh what we kind of uh uh consider is a a
[51:56] reasonably decent life and and we just
[51:58] are are are settled settled back with
[52:01] that. That must never be our case. Amen.
[52:06] &gt;&gt; And so from that, I'm actually just
[52:08] working up to a message. I want to speak
[52:12] to you on a holy,
[52:15] resourcerich nation.
[52:18] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[52:18] &gt;&gt; And that is no nation on earth except
[52:21] the one that Peter spoke about. This is
[52:24] a holy nation.
[52:26] &gt;&gt; The believers are a holy nation
[52:29] &gt;&gt; and they are a resourcerich nation. But
[52:32] we don't want the resources to be
[52:35] undeveloped
[52:36] &gt;&gt; and we don't want them to be wasted
[52:39] &gt;&gt; and we don't want them to be used for uh
[52:43] personal gain.
[52:44] &gt;&gt; But I I'm not talking about financial
[52:46] gain. I'm talking about I'm right,
[52:48] you're wrong. I'm of God, you're the
[52:49] devil, I'm this, you're serv,
[52:53] you know, I'm something righteous.
[52:55] though that kind of thing it only
[52:57] deteriorates cause it diminishes the
[52:59] power and the effectiveness of the body
[53:01] of Christ.
[53:11] The day before I arrived
[53:14] in Brazil,
[53:16] a a woman, 74 year old woman was shot
[53:20] four times. She actually was a Catholic
[53:23] nun.
[53:25] But she had given her life to the people
[53:28] in the deep Amazon.
[53:30] And she was resisting the illegal
[53:34] loggers who are who are raping the
[53:37] country, just raping it and taking from
[53:41] the local people a little plot of ground
[53:43] so they can grow a few vegetables and so
[53:45] on so forth. and and and uh uh she has
[53:51] withstood these people for I think 40
[53:54] years and she'd been threatened dozens
[53:57] and dozens of times. Well, the threat
[53:59] became a reality on the 12th. I left on
[54:02] the 14th and on the 12th she was shot
[54:08] and the government said that they're
[54:10] going to really take some strong
[54:12] measures against this. But it it it it's
[54:16] people of power because they don't want
[54:20] the resources of the land to come down
[54:24] to the people. Here's people just trying
[54:25] to ek out a little bit of a living. And
[54:27] they've said that criminals continue to
[54:31] rule in the Amazon and silencing those
[54:36] that protect its people and its forests.
[54:42] We have God laid the wealth and riches
[54:48] within the earth.
[54:50] But if you for a moment can just see
[54:53] that, let us not be temporal
[54:57] people controlled by just what we see
[55:00] and what we hear. But off here in
[55:03] another world that you can't see, but
[55:07] your real body is just a breath away
[55:10] from you.
[55:12] &gt;&gt; This one's not going to last very long.
[55:15] &gt;&gt; This one is fading away.
[55:18] &gt;&gt; This one is subject to pain and sickness
[55:21] and whatever more and and short of the
[55:23] rapture, you're going to go by the way
[55:25] of the grave. But there's another world
[55:28] where the scripture says there is no
[55:30] pain and there is no suffering and there
[55:33] is no injustices and it's another world.
[55:36] It's a reality. It's a real world like
[55:38] this one only it's going to the prophet
[55:41] said God is going to annihilate
[55:45] &gt;&gt; and I think it's so beautiful. I tell
[55:47] you what uh not that I'm telling you
[55:49] what but I'm just telling you what
[55:51] stands out to my mind. No, brother
[55:54] Brandham can say things in a very very
[55:56] simplistic way, but if you stand and
[55:59] look at it for a while and let your mind
[56:01] and spirit and soul absorb what he says.
[56:05] He talks in about the future home and he
[56:08] said he talked about the atmospheres. He
[56:11] said uh it's only the atmospheres around
[56:14] it. Talked about this world being
[56:17] consumed and uh great fire will purge
[56:20] it. He said it's not going to God's not
[56:22] going to annihilate this, but he's going
[56:25] to purge it. He's going to make it fit
[56:27] for another people who also have been
[56:30] purged now in preparation of going
[56:33] there.
[56:35] &gt;&gt; And he said, "It's only the atmospheres
[56:37] around it and the sin that's upon it,
[56:40] this earth, the atmosphere that's around
[56:42] it and the sin that's upon it." Listen
[56:45] to me, my friends. of this my last
[56:47] breath. God is going to destroy sin and
[56:51] eliminate it.
[56:54] &gt;&gt; God's going to cast Satan and his angels
[56:58] and all wickedness and all wicked lovers
[57:01] into hell.
[57:03] &gt;&gt; That is the truth of God's word. People
[57:05] would like to have God some kind of
[57:07] sugar daddy that there is no judgment.
[57:10] God, the scripture says he loves
[57:12] righteousness and hates sin.
[57:16] both. He can't be one without being the
[57:18] other.
[57:20] &gt;&gt; And he said,
[57:24] and now we realize the heavens, he said,
[57:27] means the atmospheres
[57:29] above
[57:31] for the Bible says the heaven and the
[57:33] earth will be on fire. And then he says,
[57:36] "And these these thistles and sickness,"
[57:40] now just stop there. thistles, that's
[57:43] the earth. Sickness, that's our body,
[57:47] and death. So, he's covered both the the
[57:50] the earth and what it brings forth. And
[57:53] our bodies and death and politics and
[57:58] sinful men and sinful women and evil
[58:01] spirits will all be gone. I say, "Oh,
[58:06] God, let that hour be now. If that took
[58:09] place in the next five minutes, I'd be
[58:11] the happiest man alive.
[58:19] &gt;&gt; And they will be annihilated. It has to
[58:22] be done that way because we are going to
[58:26] live right here.
[58:28] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[58:30] Oh my,
[58:33] what a reality.
[58:41] So now I say,
[58:44] how is it
[58:47] that a nation
[58:52] and I speak now of this holy nation?
[58:57] We are very very
[59:01] rich in resources
[59:04] and as some nations in the world are
[59:07] wealthier than others and there are
[59:09] povertystricken areas.
[59:12] There are places and it just so happens
[59:16] that you and I live in a very very
[59:20] blessed land. Not only materially and
[59:24] I'm not speaking materially so much as I
[59:27] am speaking of what God has poured out
[59:33] spiritually and the message of the hour
[59:36] and how available it is to us. We are
[59:41] so blessed. We have established
[59:44] churches,
[59:47] pastors and evangelists,
[59:50] other ministers
[59:52] and the message happens to be in our
[59:55] language.
[59:58] And though we have
[1:00:02] and hope you'll bear with me now. And
[1:00:05] though we have
[1:00:07] our
[1:00:09] church as a congregation,
[1:00:11] we come here and attend the service. We
[1:00:14] have our musicians
[1:00:17] and singers, our song leaders, our
[1:00:20] deacons at their posts, our trustees,
[1:00:25] our ministers.
[1:00:29] Satan is not against that. He's not
[1:00:31] really opposed to that.
[1:00:33] He doesn't really care about that. But
[1:00:37] what he is really opposed to is the word
[1:00:41] of God itself.
[1:00:44] And the scripture says, "Being born
[1:00:47] again, not of corruptible seed,
[1:00:51] but of incorruptible by the word of God
[1:00:55] that liveth and abideth forever." It's
[1:00:57] the word that he's opposed to. He's not
[1:00:59] opposed to the fact we're in church
[1:01:01] today.
[1:01:02] He's not really opposed to that. Even
[1:01:04] some may not have come to church. That's
[1:01:06] fine. That's, you know, that's up to
[1:01:08] that's them. That's up to them. But
[1:01:10] Satan's not so opposed to that. He
[1:01:13] wouldn't. Now, the reason he is opposed
[1:01:15] to it on on on account, I believe, as
[1:01:19] far as we're concerned, is because he's
[1:01:22] afraid somebody's going to hear the word
[1:01:24] of God. But it's the word that's
[1:01:25] supreme.
[1:01:27] &gt;&gt; Amen. Right.
[1:01:29] &gt;&gt; I'd like you just to notice for a moment
[1:01:30] the swer in the seed
[1:01:36] in Matthew. You won't have to turn to
[1:01:38] it. He says, "And when one heareth the
[1:01:41] word of the kingdom and understandeth it
[1:01:44] not,
[1:01:46] then cometh the wicked one and casteth
[1:01:49] away that which was sown in his heart."
[1:01:52] That's number one.
[1:01:54] And yet he said yet hath he not root in
[1:01:57] himself and this is another one but
[1:02:00] dareth for a little while and when
[1:02:02] tribulation or persecution ariseth
[1:02:04] because of the word by and by he is
[1:02:06] offended. So one the birds came and took
[1:02:09] it. The next was in rocky places and the
[1:02:12] next was amongst thorns and so on. And
[1:02:15] he became offended and and the and the
[1:02:18] word offended which I may come to a
[1:02:19] little f further on is to have a
[1:02:21] stumbling block or to put a stumbling
[1:02:23] block or an impediment in someone else's
[1:02:26] way and or to cause a person to begin to
[1:02:30] distrust and desert one whom he ought to
[1:02:33] trust and obey.
[1:02:37] That can be so subtle. say, "Well, you
[1:02:39] know what I heard or you know what I
[1:02:42] think or you know," and they just cast a
[1:02:44] little shadow, maybe against a minister,
[1:02:47] against a brother, against a family or
[1:02:49] whatever more. And the next time those
[1:02:53] people meet, that thing is back
[1:02:56] &gt;&gt; in the back of their mind. And it may
[1:02:59] not be so at all. It may not be an ounce
[1:03:02] of truth to it. It might only be
[1:03:04] someone's idea, but they've cast a
[1:03:06] shadow and it becomes a stumbling block
[1:03:10] in that person's mind and impedes and
[1:03:13] hinders the kind of fellowship and the
[1:03:16] unity that God requires. And what what
[1:03:19] are you really doing? I'm going to show
[1:03:21] a little later on that unity is one of
[1:03:24] our great resources.
[1:03:28] And it begins to it begins to detract
[1:03:32] and take away the unity of the body of
[1:03:36] Christ which is an absolute essential
[1:03:40] element amongst the bride of Jesus
[1:03:42] Christ in order so we can be effective.
[1:03:47] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen.
[1:03:49] &gt;&gt; The unity that I'm speaking about, and
[1:03:51] I'm getting a little ahead of myself
[1:03:53] now, but the unity I'm speaking about is
[1:03:56] not the fact that we come together and
[1:03:59] and are are seated together in one
[1:04:01] building. That's not the unity I'm
[1:04:03] talking about. The unity is not the fact
[1:04:06] we shake hands with one another after
[1:04:08] service and smile and give a good warm
[1:04:11] shake and are even able to say, "God
[1:04:14] blessed you." That's not the unity that
[1:04:16] I'm speak. That's wonderful and I'm glad
[1:04:19] we have it, but that's not the unity
[1:04:21] that I'm speaking about. And so, it's
[1:04:24] not the fact that we fellowship
[1:04:26] together, we shake hands, we know one
[1:04:28] another, may pick up the phone and speak
[1:04:30] with one another, and and we have a free
[1:04:32] and easy uh uh uh conversation with one
[1:04:36] another. That's not the unity I'm
[1:04:38] speaking of. I'm talking about the unity
[1:04:41] of the body of Christ, which is one
[1:04:44] spirit. You feel something. You sense
[1:04:47] something that moves from spirit from
[1:04:50] one heart to another heart. And you know
[1:04:53] that you're one. It's something that you
[1:04:56] can't describe. It's something you can't
[1:04:58] fully express. But when you look into
[1:05:00] that brother's eyes and sister's eyes,
[1:05:03] you know that there's something that
[1:05:05] goes deeper than just merely the
[1:05:07] handshake or merely the verbal uh
[1:05:10] exchange of words. God bless you. I'll
[1:05:13] pray for you. Those kind of things. But
[1:05:15] there's something that is within and you
[1:05:18] know you have a revelation. You've been
[1:05:20] birthed into one family. Indeed, you're
[1:05:23] one bread. Indeed, you are the body of
[1:05:27] Jesus Christ.
[1:05:30] And it's a marvelous body.
[1:05:33] &gt;&gt; It's a wonderful body. And Satan hates
[1:05:38] that body.
[1:05:41] &gt;&gt; Despises
[1:05:43] all she is and all she stands for. But
[1:05:47] God loves her.
[1:05:50] &gt;&gt; She's the husband, the wife of Jesus
[1:05:52] Christ, our husband. Amen. Amen.
[1:05:55] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:05:57] &gt;&gt; So I'd like you to notice
[1:06:01] he that received it amongst the seed
[1:06:03] amongst thorns is he that heareth the
[1:06:06] word and the cares of this world and the
[1:06:09] deceitfulness of riches choke out the
[1:06:12] word and he becometh unfruitful. I'd
[1:06:15] like you to notice please the fowls of
[1:06:19] the air,
[1:06:20] the tribulation or persecution,
[1:06:25] being offended,
[1:06:27] the cares of this world, and the
[1:06:30] deceitfulness of riches. These five all
[1:06:34] all come from the same source. Satan is
[1:06:38] the he's the uh uh he he he's the
[1:06:42] initiator of all of them. And all of
[1:06:45] them are uh uh attacking one thing and
[1:06:49] that's the seed.
[1:06:51] &gt;&gt; They simply use different means,
[1:06:53] different methods to make it ineffective
[1:06:58] to re to reduce it down and make it
[1:07:01] ineffective.
[1:07:02] And so whether he choke it out or
[1:07:04] whether he steals it or takes it by the
[1:07:06] birds of foul air, all of them are are
[1:07:10] uh they're opposed to one thing. They're
[1:07:14] not opposed to our singing and our
[1:07:16] worship and our whatever more. They're
[1:07:19] not opposed to me preaching, but they
[1:07:21] are very very much opposed to the fact
[1:07:24] that I would or any other minister would
[1:07:26] lay before God and say, "Oh God, open up
[1:07:30] this word that you sent. Don't leave my
[1:07:32] mind. Don't leave my mind darkened and
[1:07:36] don't leave it confused and don't leave
[1:07:38] me hindered. Don't leave me restricted."
[1:07:41] And the church needs to say, "Oh God,
[1:07:43] don't let the man of God who's going to
[1:07:45] stand in the place behind the pullpit,
[1:07:48] don't let him be hindered. Don't let him
[1:07:50] be restricted. Don't let anything in me,
[1:07:53] don't let any thought that I have, don't
[1:07:55] let any relationship that I have within
[1:07:58] the body of Christ. Don't let it hinder
[1:08:00] in any way
[1:08:03] &gt;&gt; this bride, this body, the body. It's
[1:08:07] not what I feel or what I think."
[1:08:09] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:08:11] It's what is benefit the greatest
[1:08:13] benefit to the body of Christ.
[1:08:18] &gt;&gt; So we met these brethren.
[1:08:22] One brother translates in one area. One
[1:08:25] brother translates in another area.
[1:08:29] Those two brothers
[1:08:31] had one heard that the other one had
[1:08:34] said certain things about him and vice
[1:08:36] versa. And they don't communicate.
[1:08:38] Period. They just don't communicate.
[1:08:41] They don't exchange their translations
[1:08:43] to one another.
[1:08:48] They're both pastors. They've got
[1:08:50] churches. They're preaching probably
[1:08:52] right now.
[1:08:57] But the people because one wants to say,
[1:09:01] "Well, I was offended.
[1:09:04] I heard that you said such and such and
[1:09:07] we just we just stay you stay in your
[1:09:10] corner I'll stay in mine.
[1:09:15] The resource is they got command of the
[1:09:18] language.
[1:09:20] &gt;&gt; The resource is they can translate. The
[1:09:23] resource is they're not poor.
[1:09:26] They each have that and others.
[1:09:29] But the rest of the country says
[1:09:32] bread,
[1:09:33] &gt;&gt; bread.
[1:09:34] &gt;&gt; We just want bread.
[1:09:36] &gt;&gt; And when we left, they said here's
[1:09:39] pastors been ministering for 30 years.
[1:09:41] Don't leave us. Don't leave us alone.
[1:09:45] Whatever you tell us to do, that's what
[1:09:46] we're going to do. We see we've heard
[1:09:48] we've heard what's happening in India.
[1:09:50] We've heard what's happening in these
[1:09:51] other places. And we showed them the
[1:09:53] Congo video and and the minister sat
[1:09:55] there just a small screen there behind
[1:09:57] the pullpit maybe 50 60 70 ministers.
[1:10:00] And when the Congo video was done and
[1:10:02] the people worshiping in that stadium, I
[1:10:04] tell you what, those ministers were on
[1:10:06] their feet, hands in the air. There's as
[1:10:09] much roaring going on right there in
[1:10:11] that building as there was on the video
[1:10:13] itself. And the video shut down. They
[1:10:15] just carried right on. They were swept
[1:10:17] away and they were caught. They saw I
[1:10:19] said now what you're going to see here
[1:10:21] you're going to see what people did in
[1:10:23] the Congo. This is Congolese people made
[1:10:25] in Congo not made in America is made in
[1:10:28] Congo for the Congolese done by the
[1:10:31] Congalles. This is and and now it's
[1:10:33] going to over 50 nations around the
[1:10:35] country from one of the poorest nations
[1:10:37] on earth because they have not counted
[1:10:40] on a natural resource but they've
[1:10:42] counted on their spiritual resource.
[1:10:46] I said, "Oh God, Gloverdale Bible way.
[1:10:49] Oh God, we need we need a stirring
[1:10:52] within our heart so that we we lay hold
[1:10:56] of the resources that we have within us.
[1:11:02] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:11:04] &gt;&gt; And we do have them.
[1:11:06] &gt;&gt; It's a rich nation. This holy nation
[1:11:10] &gt;&gt; rich."
[1:11:13] &gt;&gt; And Satan is this. He's uh despises this
[1:11:17] word.
[1:11:19] We may think about the labor and the
[1:11:21] work that's involved.
[1:11:23] I thought about when people said, "Well,
[1:11:25] my,
[1:11:27] you know, you've you've traveled and so
[1:11:28] on and and it's hard." Yes, it is.
[1:11:32] I I thought of and I'm on a jet. I think
[1:11:34] of brother Brandham on a turb just a
[1:11:38] prop plane flying through the
[1:11:42] just incredible weather of Africa and
[1:11:44] the thunderstorms and the the the
[1:11:48] sheer winds and everything else that
[1:11:50] takes place and wind wings flapping in
[1:11:52] that old plane flying for hours and
[1:11:55] hours and hours to get to a place and
[1:11:58] have the length of meetings that he had
[1:12:00] and the expenditure of his strength and
[1:12:03] his energy and his life poured out
[1:12:10] and have him say,
[1:12:12] "And if I had 10,000 lives,
[1:12:16] I'd like to give every bit of it for
[1:12:18] this word."
[1:12:21] &gt;&gt; For it's the word of Jesus Christ.
[1:12:26] &gt;&gt; We want to be able to stir people in the
[1:12:28] right way.
[1:12:29] Brother Vanderly I guess told someone
[1:12:32] else. So I I don't have
[1:12:35] don't have the language but he told
[1:12:37] someone after the meetings were all over
[1:12:38] and
[1:12:40] someone came and just said brother
[1:12:43] Biscll several of the pastors the
[1:12:45] pastors are coming to brother Vanderlay
[1:12:47] and saying that you you have you know
[1:12:50] you've embarrassed them and made them
[1:12:52] feel. I said well what was that? Oh, he
[1:12:56] said they were telling brother Vanderly,
[1:12:59] we we preach so hard and we preach so
[1:13:02] deep. We preach, you know, so such the
[1:13:04] depths of the word of God and we feel
[1:13:07] that we work so hard and we saw brother
[1:13:10] Biscll at 70 years old up there acting
[1:13:12] like he was 17. He said, "We felt
[1:13:15] embarrassed. We felt ashamed of
[1:13:17] ourselves." Well, I just thank God if
[1:13:19] that's the way they saw it. Maybe they
[1:13:20] were seeing a vision. I thank God that
[1:13:23] that stirred them in the right
[1:13:24] direction.
[1:13:26] &gt;&gt; As long as I'm able to preach, I hope
[1:13:28] I'm able to preach as a as a as a young
[1:13:31] man. God grant that. And then when I see
[1:13:33] this, if I had 10,000 lives, I'd like to
[1:13:36] just live it for him. Like you just pour
[1:13:39] it out for this word. And so let's not
[1:13:42] look at the 10,000 lives say, "God, at
[1:13:44] least you give me one. And this one
[1:13:47] shall be used for your glory. This one
[1:13:49] shall be used for your kingdom. I'm here
[1:13:52] to make a mark.
[1:13:56] &gt;&gt; God bless you, Sister Sarah, for that
[1:13:58] song. I think it'd be good to hear that
[1:14:00] again.
[1:14:06] &gt;&gt; I'm going to just be another few minutes
[1:14:07] and I'm going to quit and if it's all
[1:14:09] right, I'll start again this afternoon.
[1:14:19] I would like us and if you could
[1:14:21] possibly make an effort to be here this
[1:14:23] evening.
[1:14:26] I would like you to be thinking about
[1:14:28] the potentials within us
[1:14:32] in the message here ye him in Lima Ohio.
[1:14:36] Brother Brandham said, 'I want to say
[1:14:38] this before I start preaching that the
[1:14:39] greatest need of healing tonight
[1:14:42] and the sickest body that I know of in
[1:14:46] all of the world is the body of the Lord
[1:14:49] Jesus,
[1:14:51] the church.
[1:14:54] Now, I know I've made reference to this
[1:14:57] and I've said I believe the bride of
[1:14:59] Christ is a marvelous, beautiful body
[1:15:02] and I do. But brother Brandham was
[1:15:04] seeing something else also. And I just
[1:15:06] and I need it for reference to this this
[1:15:09] this service today
[1:15:12] in the message also in 1964 and Jesus
[1:15:15] keeps all his appointments.
[1:15:17] He said and we believe tonight though we
[1:15:20] see you make the blind to see. Now
[1:15:22] notice what he says. Though we make the
[1:15:24] blind to see, and the deaf to hear, and
[1:15:28] the lame to walk, and by doctor
[1:15:31] statements have seen you raise up five
[1:15:34] people from the dead in different times,
[1:15:37] in different nations. But yet tonight, I
[1:15:41] believe the most sickest thing I know of
[1:15:44] tonight is the body of Christ here on
[1:15:48] earth, the church. It's really sick.
[1:15:51] Heal it tonight, Lord.
[1:15:56] We might be afflicted.
[1:16:00] And I believe in this church,
[1:16:03] we also need healing.
[1:16:06] Because I'm speaking of something deeper
[1:16:08] than just coming together.
[1:16:11] You know, you know well from the society
[1:16:14] that we live in, there are lots of homes
[1:16:19] out there, and I trust not here, but
[1:16:22] lots of homes where the father and the
[1:16:25] mother and the children and the and the
[1:16:29] occupants of the house really are
[1:16:31] nothing more than just people who
[1:16:33] gravitate around their own little circle
[1:16:35] and they've got their own little orbit
[1:16:37] and they come and meet under one roof
[1:16:39] and do their own little thing and then
[1:16:41] they're gone and they they live all they
[1:16:44] are is living in some sort of isolation
[1:16:46] and they they they communicate what they
[1:16:49] need, you know, what they need to
[1:16:51] communicate, but but everybody's busy.
[1:16:53] The wife's got her circle, and the
[1:16:55] husband has his circle, the kids got
[1:16:57] theirs, and they're all orbiting in
[1:16:59] their own little spheres, and they only
[1:17:00] meet under one roof.
[1:17:03] This church
[1:17:05] and any believer's church has not been
[1:17:09] intended by God that you have your own
[1:17:12] little circle and you have your own
[1:17:13] little family and you've got your own
[1:17:15] little things and you've got your
[1:17:16] concerns out there and you've got your
[1:17:19] direction, you have your agenda, but we
[1:17:21] all just kind of, you know, there are
[1:17:23] certain set time and part of our agenda
[1:17:24] is that we kind of come here and rotate
[1:17:26] together for a few moments and then
[1:17:28] we're all gone our own individual ways
[1:17:30] again. That's not the unity I'm talking
[1:17:33] about. I'm talking about the unity that
[1:17:36] it's on your mind. You're thinking of
[1:17:39] some believers every day. You're
[1:17:41] thinking of a brother. You're thinking
[1:17:43] of a sister. You're thinking of another
[1:17:44] family. Maybe not here but elsewhere.
[1:17:47] And it's on your mind. And it's on your
[1:17:49] heart. And you're consumed with them.
[1:17:53] Even though you're busy with your own uh
[1:17:55] things and things a dayto day that you
[1:17:57] have to attend to, but your your your
[1:17:59] your whole interest is this body of
[1:18:03] Jesus Christ. Oh, where's my other hand?
[1:18:07] Where's my other finger today? Where's
[1:18:09] the other part of this body? And how are
[1:18:12] they doing? And and this is the thing
[1:18:14] that is uppermost in our minds, I
[1:18:17] believe, more and more. And as that day
[1:18:18] approaches, that's what's going to
[1:18:21] consume our thoughts.
[1:18:28] &gt;&gt; And I think in this area
[1:18:31] we could do with some healing. Yes,
[1:18:41] &gt;&gt; we have some great potentials
[1:18:44] and I'm just going to name one and then
[1:18:47] we'll go on this evening.
[1:18:50] We have the potential for unity
[1:18:58] endeavoring to keep the unity of the
[1:19:00] spirit in the bond of peace.
[1:19:06] You know, it's hard
[1:19:09] maybe if you hear that someone
[1:19:12] thinks a certain thing of you or someone
[1:19:16] has done a certain thing
[1:19:20] and it offended you, hurt you, hurt you
[1:19:23] very very deeply, maybe cut you, wounded
[1:19:26] you.
[1:19:28] Perhaps it came to you on good
[1:19:30] authority, but you're not too sure. Or
[1:19:34] uh just something took place maybe
[1:19:36] within the church or within the body uh
[1:19:39] of believers or whatever more. Uh uh
[1:19:44] Satan is not short on ideas.
[1:19:47] &gt;&gt; Amen. He's got lots of them.
[1:19:50] &gt;&gt; And then that thing,
[1:19:52] you know, it lays there like a heavy
[1:19:54] weight.
[1:19:56] He wants you to think about that.
[1:19:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:19:59] &gt;&gt; He wants you to ponder that. But I am
[1:20:02] here today to declare to you in the name
[1:20:06] of the Lord God of Israel,
[1:20:08] the Lord Jesus Christ. I declare to you
[1:20:12] that you possess the resource within you
[1:20:15] to actually forget that
[1:20:18] &gt;&gt; you actually possess you have the
[1:20:21] potential within you to lay that down.
[1:20:24] &gt;&gt; You have the potential within you to
[1:20:27] forget your hurt and to lay it down even
[1:20:30] at a great cost to lay it down. Well,
[1:20:33] why would I lay it down? I lay it down
[1:20:35] for the benefit of the body of Christ. I
[1:20:38] lay it down so that will be no hindrance
[1:20:40] when I walk into the church. In fact, is
[1:20:43] I so lay it down. I take that brother, I
[1:20:46] take that sister around the neck and
[1:20:48] give them an embrace and let them know
[1:20:51] my spirit is pure.
[1:20:56] &gt;&gt; Now you've done something.
[1:20:58] &gt;&gt; Now you've done something. You've mined
[1:21:01] out a reserve. You've mined out some
[1:21:04] more out of the out of the body of
[1:21:07] Christ. You've you've reached down into
[1:21:10] the resources of the body of Christ and
[1:21:13] have given it out to the benefit of the
[1:21:15] whole body.
[1:21:18] &gt;&gt; You didn't keep it as your own little
[1:21:20] pet peeve, your own little pet hurt.
[1:21:23] Well, I'm going to I'm going to have my
[1:21:25] own pity party and I'm just going to
[1:21:27] keep this way and I'm going to be
[1:21:29] miserable and I I don't care what
[1:21:31] anybody thinks. I'll make everybody
[1:21:33] else's no I'm miserable. I'll be
[1:21:36] downcast. I'll be sour. I'll be
[1:21:38] whatever. And when I look at someone,
[1:21:40] they'll be despondent, too, just because
[1:21:42] the way I look. I say that's a shame and
[1:21:45] a disgrace to the body of Christ. I say
[1:21:48] in the name of Jesus Christ, lay that
[1:21:51] thing down
[1:21:55] &gt;&gt; and let it depart
[1:21:59] &gt;&gt; so that there is a a glorious
[1:22:03] spirit that God can come and visit with
[1:22:07] his presence and he will come and attend
[1:22:10] with you.
[1:22:13] &gt;&gt; I say hallelujah.
[1:22:15] &gt;&gt; We have that resource. It is here with
[1:22:18] us. The prophet told us we have every
[1:22:21] resource that we have need of.
[1:22:23] &gt;&gt; Do you agree?
[1:22:25] &gt;&gt; You agree with him? We have that
[1:22:27] resource.
[1:22:29] &gt;&gt; I say glory be to God.
[1:22:31] &gt;&gt; I have found this nation rich in
[1:22:34] resources.
[1:22:38] Amen.
[1:22:40] &gt;&gt; But oh,
[1:22:43] how the enemy in all of his cunning and
[1:22:46] craft
[1:22:47] will devise
[1:22:49] so many things.
[1:22:52] I say to you today, you have the power,
[1:22:57] not only the resource of unity, you have
[1:22:58] the power of forgiveness.
[1:23:03] &gt;&gt; Some people say, "I have such a
[1:23:04] difficult time. I've never been able to
[1:23:06] say I'm sorry." Forgive me. Try it out.
[1:23:11] &gt;&gt; How do I do it? Open your mouth is the
[1:23:13] first thing.
[1:23:15] &gt;&gt; And then down in your heart
[1:23:17] &gt;&gt; and let it come from the heart, not from
[1:23:19] the lips. Say it from the heart. Why do
[1:23:22] I say it from the heart? Because God's
[1:23:24] word says you should do it.
[1:23:30] &gt;&gt; But he did wrong. So how long we going
[1:23:34] to live with that? Amen.
[1:23:36] &gt;&gt; But you did say it. So,
[1:23:41] &gt;&gt; how long you going to live with it?
[1:23:53] few days ago
[1:23:57] in the last 30 days
[1:24:02] there was a debt that was owed
[1:24:06] and it wasn't a few hundred but it was a
[1:24:08] few thousand dollar.
[1:24:11] I did not owe the bill
[1:24:15] but I felt somehow responsible.
[1:24:21] I kind of brought the people together
[1:24:24] and in their coming together was left
[1:24:27] with a debt.
[1:24:33] And
[1:24:34] so the man let me know he was a a
[1:24:38] lawyer. He let me know that he was going
[1:24:40] to go after these people legally.
[1:24:45] So I thought about it for actually
[1:24:48] probably 3 4 months
[1:24:55] and I got dressed up my suit
[1:24:58] and told my wife I'm going into the
[1:25:00] city.
[1:25:02] She didn't know what I was going in for.
[1:25:04] And I went with the purpose of going to
[1:25:06] that man's office because I had already
[1:25:08] decided what I was going to do
[1:25:13] and he was away.
[1:25:23] But that didn't make any difference
[1:25:26] as I'm already set on that course.
[1:25:29] So I did some other things and came
[1:25:32] home. I sat down with my wife and I said
[1:25:36] that account that's owed by these men.
[1:25:41] I said I was awake early in the morning
[1:25:44] and I had already decided. So, I went
[1:25:47] into town to see this lawyer and I'm
[1:25:50] telling him, "I can't just do it right
[1:25:54] this minute, but if you will be a little
[1:25:56] bit patient, I'm going to pay that bill.
[1:26:00] And if it's only a certain amount each
[1:26:03] month, but I will pay that bill. Do not
[1:26:06] pursue these men any further."
[1:26:10] And my wife said,
[1:26:13] "I admire you."
[1:26:16] That was worth
[1:26:18] the debt.
[1:26:20] Just to have those words. My wife has
[1:26:22] never heard me say this, but she just
[1:26:25] said, "I admire you." She knows I don't
[1:26:27] owe the bill.
[1:26:29] And I admire her for not saying, "Are
[1:26:32] you crazy?
[1:26:35] What's the matter with you? We can use
[1:26:37] that money elsewhere. We need it
[1:26:39] somewhere else. Why give it to that
[1:26:40] unbeliever?
[1:26:42] Now, that's all the words she said. I
[1:26:44] admire you
[1:26:46] and I say to you as the body of Christ,
[1:26:51] I try to set an example.
[1:26:56] When Men of Vision was started,
[1:27:00] I had a pastor of this message
[1:27:04] write me a long letter signed by over 50
[1:27:09] members of his congregation, some who I
[1:27:12] personally brought to the message and
[1:27:15] said, "You have brought forth a bastard
[1:27:18] child
[1:27:20] because I wanted to do something for the
[1:27:23] believers." And the fact that these
[1:27:26] brethren have gone overseas
[1:27:29] to build houses for the believers who
[1:27:33] are homeless today. The fact that they
[1:27:35] went and networked
[1:27:38] uh all the computers so that the
[1:27:41] messages could be better and more
[1:27:44] effectively printed in the Congo. And
[1:27:46] because of all of that, because of the
[1:27:48] things that these brethren have done,
[1:27:50] and yet a minister said, "You know what?
[1:27:53] If he was here at this moment, it
[1:27:56] wouldn't be it would not be at all an
[1:27:59] effort for me to cast my arms around his
[1:28:03] neck and to embrace him and to say,
[1:28:06] "You're my brother."
[1:28:08] &gt;&gt; You perhaps didn't understand, but
[1:28:10] you're my brother. Why would I do that?
[1:28:13] Not because I feel constrained. Not
[1:28:16] because I feel under pressure. Not
[1:28:19] because I'm preaching this message to
[1:28:21] you, but I believe we have the resource
[1:28:23] within us to be void of an ill feeling.
[1:28:27] I believe we have the resource within us
[1:28:30] to be as Jesus Christ was. And we have
[1:28:33] to put him as our as our example.
[1:28:39] &gt;&gt; Whatever he would do, that's what I want
[1:28:42] to do.
[1:28:43] &gt;&gt; And we want to be void of offense. Not
[1:28:46] for our feelings, not for our position,
[1:28:48] but for the body of Christ. Be void of
[1:28:51] offense. Be absolutely void of it. You
[1:28:54] have the resource in you. And I tell
[1:28:56] you, in the name of Jesus Christ, don't
[1:28:58] go out of this building the way you
[1:29:00] walked in. You might have to do some
[1:29:02] tall thinking. You might have to do some
[1:29:04] deep, deep pondering in your heart. But
[1:29:07] I tell you, you have a resource. If
[1:29:09] you're a member of the body of Jesus
[1:29:10] Christ, you have a you are part of a
[1:29:14] nation that is extremely resourceful and
[1:29:17] extremely rich.
[1:29:19] &gt;&gt; And all you need to do is tap into some
[1:29:21] of that that you have.
[1:29:23] &gt;&gt; It is your possession.
[1:29:25] &gt;&gt; And it's not given you for your own
[1:29:27] personal benefit, but it's given to you
[1:29:29] for the benefit of the body of Jesus
[1:29:32] Christ. Amen.
[1:29:37] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen?
[1:29:41] &gt;&gt; It doesn't take a strong man or a strong
[1:29:43] woman to hold a grudge.
[1:29:49] It is not
[1:29:52] It is not weakness
[1:29:54] to say, "I've forgiven you."
[1:30:00] It doesn't take a strong person to say,
[1:30:03] "I was right and I'm holding to it and
[1:30:06] that's all there is to it." Or, "This
[1:30:07] person said that or they did this or
[1:30:09] whatever." So what? How long is that
[1:30:10] going to go on?
[1:30:13] &gt;&gt; You want to cross the bar actually
[1:30:15] thinking that, feeling that? I say, "No,
[1:30:17] sir. No, sir. I tell you now before God
[1:30:22] over this holy word of God, you don't
[1:30:24] want to cross the bar that way. You
[1:30:26] don't want to enter into the rapture
[1:30:27] that way. You want to enter into with
[1:30:29] purity,
[1:30:31] &gt;&gt; hallelujah, with a righteous, holy, and
[1:30:35] endeavoring to keep the unity, as I
[1:30:38] said, not the unity of getting together.
[1:30:40] And we have a wonderful congregation,
[1:30:43] absolutely a marvelous congregation. I
[1:30:45] just love you so dearly, all of you.
[1:30:48] every segment of this congregation I
[1:30:51] love. And and and if there's any reason
[1:30:53] why I shouldn't, I'm I'm absolutely
[1:30:56] naive to the whole thing. People talk
[1:30:58] about stuff going on in the church. I'm
[1:30:59] I'm so glad I'm ignorant about it. I
[1:31:01] don't I don't I don't hardly know about
[1:31:03] it. I love the people. I love the
[1:31:06] congregation. And each one of you, I
[1:31:09] just have such a a relationship. But I
[1:31:12] tell you, over over this word of God, we
[1:31:15] want to uh I believe that there's a
[1:31:18] healing that can take place.
[1:31:20] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And now I've only covered we
[1:31:23] have the resource and the potentials for
[1:31:27] unity and for forgiveness.
[1:31:30] &gt;&gt; We have that. You don't have to get it.
[1:31:33] You say, "Well, you know, is it going to
[1:31:34] come? Is it going to drop down?" No,
[1:31:35] it's inside of you. You already possess
[1:31:37] it. You already have it. Isn't that
[1:31:39] wonderful?
[1:31:42] &gt;&gt; Brazil has it.
[1:31:46] And I close with this translator here.
[1:31:50] Translator over there. You know what
[1:31:51] brother Tonyy's doing today? He's
[1:31:54] driving. He's flying. He's one man. He's
[1:31:58] a oneman revival right now. One man. is
[1:32:01] going and and and speaking to this
[1:32:03] brother and to that pastor and to
[1:32:05] another and this translator. And
[1:32:10] if we wanted to give up, I'd have given
[1:32:13] up. I sat in the meeting
[1:32:18] and we said, "We need brothers. This is
[1:32:20] going to be a made in Brazil
[1:32:23] for Brazil.
[1:32:25] You've got all the resources. You don't
[1:32:26] really need us. If you want us just to
[1:32:28] be here to kind of bring it together,
[1:32:31] we'll do that. If you want us to
[1:32:32] administrate it, we'll administrate it
[1:32:34] as long as you need it. But as soon as
[1:32:35] you say we can do it cuz you brothers
[1:32:37] can do it, we're gone. We're out of
[1:32:38] here. But we'll help you. We're not here
[1:32:41] to build anything.
[1:32:43] &gt;&gt; No. They said, "We don't want you to
[1:32:44] leave. Don't you leave us alone."
[1:32:48] I said, "Well, we need you. The first
[1:32:50] thing is we need this senior brother and
[1:32:53] we need this senior brother. You've got
[1:32:55] to sit on it. You've got to be the
[1:32:57] directors. You got to be on the board.
[1:33:02] The one brother says, "If he's on the
[1:33:04] board, I will not sit on the board."
[1:33:11] I just about said, "Where's my airline
[1:33:12] ticket?
[1:33:14] I'm out of here. Here we've been
[1:33:16] preaching. Here we've been doing all I'm
[1:33:18] out of here." Wouldn't you feel that
[1:33:20] way?
[1:33:21] &gt;&gt; No. We just had to start keep slugging
[1:33:23] it out. And you say, "Well, where'd it
[1:33:25] go from there?" Well, it went straight
[1:33:26] downhill from there before that meeting
[1:33:29] was over. I mean, I thought I was below
[1:33:31] zero, below ground level.
[1:33:34] And then then it just get into a little
[1:33:36] bit. Well, I heard you say this and I
[1:33:38] heard you say that. And brother Tony and
[1:33:40] I just sat there and twiddled our
[1:33:42] thumbs, wait till all of that got over
[1:33:44] and say, well, here we go again. We're
[1:33:46] going to give up to that devil. Not a
[1:33:48] chance. We're going to pull him by the
[1:33:49] scuff of the neck and pow pow and let
[1:33:52] him know we're here for the long term.
[1:33:54] We're not here for the short term. And
[1:33:56] we let the brothers know we're not going
[1:33:57] to leave you alone.
[1:33:59] &gt;&gt; Going to be right here with you.
[1:34:01] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And that's what he's doing.
[1:34:03] &gt;&gt; Praise God.
[1:34:05] &gt;&gt; You might come in here and say, "Well, I
[1:34:06] don't know if I'm ready to do that where
[1:34:08] I'm going to keep pounding with the word
[1:34:10] and keep preaching the word and the
[1:34:12] other brother's going to keep preaching
[1:34:13] it and we're going to draw on these
[1:34:15] resources that we have."
[1:34:17] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:34:19] &gt;&gt; Praise God. It's a glorious church
[1:34:23] &gt;&gt; without spot or wrinkle. Let's stand,
[1:34:26] shall we?
[1:34:28] &gt;&gt; Heavenly Father, we have not spoken
[1:34:31] these words merely
[1:34:33] for the people to have uh some
[1:34:35] enthusiasm, but we can see that it is
[1:34:38] striking accord. It's striking something
[1:34:41] in their hearts that's declaring by the
[1:34:44] Holy Ghost, it's true. It's true. And I
[1:34:47] believe that I possess that. I accept
[1:34:50] it. I receive it. And Lord Jesus, I pray
[1:34:53] that it will bring forth. This seed
[1:34:55] that's been sown will bring forth much
[1:34:57] fruit in the name of Jesus Christ. Bless
[1:34:59] the congregation. Bless as they have a
[1:35:02] short time away, Lord, a rest and some
[1:35:05] refreshment and food. And then I pray
[1:35:07] that you will bless the service, the
[1:35:09] gathering this afternoon. In your name
[1:35:12] we ask it. Amen.
[1:35:15] &gt;&gt; Let's just sing a verse or two of this
[1:35:16] song.
