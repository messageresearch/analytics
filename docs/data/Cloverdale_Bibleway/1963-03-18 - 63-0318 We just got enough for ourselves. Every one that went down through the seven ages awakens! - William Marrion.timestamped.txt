[0:00] be saved and for this cause God has sent
[0:04] them strong
[0:06] delusion that they should believe
[0:12] AE it should be translated there as
[0:14] looks in the lection
[0:16] thei not AI thei same one he told Eve
[0:21] that they might be damned who believed
[0:25] not the truth but had pleasure in
[0:28] unrighteousness
[0:31] what a statement
[0:33] mom as the bride is taken away then this
[0:39] man of sin will reveal
[0:43] himself she the true bride of Christ has
[0:47] been elected out of every Church age now
[0:51] the other day I made a statement the
[0:53] bride could go home and you never know
[0:54] anything about it that's
[0:56] true somebody said uh brother Brown that
[1:01] would be a mighty small group Jesus said
[1:04] as it was in the days of
[1:07] Noah I you talk to him about
[1:10] it wherein eight Souls were saved by
[1:16] water so shall it be in the coming of
[1:19] the son of
[1:22] man if they were
[1:24] 800 went in the Rapture tonight you
[1:28] never hear a word about it tomorrow the
[1:30] next day or no other time it'd be gone
[1:33] you didn't know nothing about it it just
[1:35] be the same thing what am I trying to
[1:38] say I'm not trying to scare you wear you
[1:41] um I want you to be on your
[1:43] toes amen be ready watching every minute
[1:47] quit your nonsense just get out to
[1:50] business with God because it's later
[1:52] than you think now remember the true
[1:56] bride now there is a false bride we get
[1:59] that in Revelation 17 he said I am a
[2:03] widow and have no need of nothing and
[2:05] see sitting up on this scar cold beet
[2:07] and so forth the Beast brother now but
[2:09] the true bride will be made up of
[2:13] thousands times thousands of people but
[2:16] it will be the elect out of every Church
[2:19] age every time a message went forth and
[2:23] the people believed it and accepted it
[2:25] in all the light it was when they were
[2:28] sealed away until that day of
[2:31] redemption Jesus speak the same thing
[2:33] when he said the sound come and the the
[2:37] seventh watch that's the last Church age
[2:40] and said behold a bridegroom coming
[2:42] throughout the meeting then the sleeping
[2:44] virsion come rub your eyes and said
[2:46] suppos I already has some that are to so
[2:49] uh maybe you better have some and the
[2:50] real true bride we just got enough for
[2:53] ourselves we just got enough get in or S
[2:57] we can't give you nothing if you want
[2:58] something you go pray up and while she
[3:00] was gone the bridegroom come and in went
[3:03] the bride and then the remnant there the
[3:06] ones that were absolutely virgins the
[3:08] church was left
[3:11] outside and he said there will be
[3:14] weeping and wailing and nashing of PE
[3:17] see now that's the elect and when the
[3:21] sound come the bridegroom cometh then
[3:25] every one of those that F down through
[3:28] those ages
[3:30] awaken
[3:32] everyone see it isn't God as we' think
[3:35] just go to Honey mount a few thousand
[3:37] people of this age and take them it's a
[3:40] very elected out of every age and that's
[3:44] the reason Christ has to stay on the Met
[3:47] Road seat back here as an intercessor
[3:49] until that last one comes in at the last
[3:53] age and these Revelations out of what
[3:56] has been breaks forth upon the people
[3:58] and then see what's happened
[4:00] you get it now all right but in the days
[4:04] of the voice of the seventh angel when
[4:06] he shall begin to sound the mystery of
[4:08] God should be finished as he hath
[4:10] declared to his servants the prophets
