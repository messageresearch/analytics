So, the regular church uh takes care of it and looks after it and has the sound and the seats and all. It's a really, really nice situation. So, uh real happy for the saints down in the Seattle area have a nice place to worship and meet on Friday and Sundays. Brother John will be going down this evening and taking their uh their first service in the new facility this evening at 5:00. So, we just trust they have a really wonderful time.

Looks like he'll be uh he's in the military. It looks like we'll be in Afghanistan for his sixth tour. Very dangerous assignment. Want to remember brother Ed Dods. [Music] in the nursing home this morning as well. It's now been two and a half years since he has sat had his stroke. I want to remember that on behalf of Sister Sally Dodds this morning. God bless you, Sister Sally. It's good to have you here. We'll have brother John come and lead us in prayer this morning. If you have a special need upon your heart or it's desired that the Lord would speak to you in a special way, let's make it known by the uplifted hand as we go to prayer. Brother John. Heavenly Father, just to be in your house is a privilege, Lord, to be able to lift up our hearts and our hands and sing praises to your holy name. Lord, we just want to open up our mouths right now and say, "Thank you, Jesus. Glorify your name, God. For without you, where would we be this morning? out in the world somewhere, some pig pin, some slop of this world that is swiftly fading and degenerating into a horrible hell. But Lord, you've spoken a word and a message to us, saying, "Come a little higher, little bride. Come a little higher. Spread your wings, eagles, and fly up into the heavenlies where all things are possible." Lord, to be able to sing the songs of victory and of faith gives us encouragement, Lord, that we are not alone in this battle, but you are with us, even in us all the way to the end. And Lord, we just want to come into your presence, God, humbly, Lord, realizing it's all amazing grace and mercy. It's all because of your choosing and your election that we even have a desire for you. So we just pray that you would open the floodgates of your heart today, God. And may there be a mutual response from us, Lord. That there would be a communication, God, and a reaching out in praises and waving of our hands and shouting hallelujah. And Lord, let us all be worshippers today, God. We're not here to spectate, God. We're here to participate, God, and get into salvation. get into our healing, God, as hands are lifted up all over the service, Lord, showing that we have needs, God, and but we serve a great God. And we pray that you'd release the power, God, and every heart to believe that all things are possible for them, Lord. And as sheep, Lord, we come to eat on sheep food today. And as eagles, God, we're gathered around the carcass. We believe we're hearing a word that's going to take us in a rapture. It's getting us ready for a body change, God. And I pray that you would lift up our eyes and lift up our affection from our own uh situations or our own little petty things that's in our lives and get a vision of the bride, God. And what you're doing in the word, Father, as vision, God, is so quicker than our natural sight, Lord. Take us up into that six sense today, God. God, and pour out revelation through our pastor, God, that we as your people, God, could come up into heavenly places, God. We long for the supernatural, as David said, to see the glory. And we hunger and thirst, Lord, to see you, God, high and lifted up in all your beauty. Lord, would you forgive us all of our sins, of our iniquities, God? We don't want there to be any blockages today, God. Keep the way clear. Let nothing be between us, Lord. &gt;&gt; Lord, we're not here to hide behind anything or anyone else. We need Jesus. &gt;&gt; We need the Lord today, God. And we're in your house, God. Just may you meet every need as our brother Edwin Dods. Lord, be with him and his family on this Father's Day, God. And this other gentleman going into service for his country. I just pray for him and his family. be with all of us today, God. This special day, God, this day of your appearing. I pray that your word would be precious. May you meet every need divinely beyond what we could ever ask or think, God. And may there be waves upon waves of your glory in the services today, Lord. We love you. We love you, Jesus. And we thank you for answering every prayer for your glory and your honor in Jesus name. Amen. [Music] &gt;&gt; Amen. You may have your seats this morning. I think they got those slides for us on the sanctuary, the new facility in Tuck Willis. So, this is a quick look at the sanctuary from back at the sound booth. So, I don't know how many know in the past they've had to carry in the soundboard. they've had to carry each Friday night and each Sunday. So, they basically set up church down there from scratch. You set up all the chairs. Well, now they don't have to do that. So, you can see they've got a very nice uh seating facility there. And uh go to the fourth slide if you could. They have a baptismal tank right in the church. So, they don't have to go down and try and uh get a hotel that has a little swimming pool where we've done the baptisms in the past. They have a nice little um the next slide over number five that's connected to the sanctuary. So the sanctuary actually seats about 130 150 people and then they have a wall that's removable and uh this is on the other side of the wall so you can have uh little meetings over there in outside of the regular services. This is a hallway showing down into the uh sanctuaries there on the left. This is the kind of the foyer sitting area. just as you come in. They have a very nice nursery. So, just show the nursery real quick to the moms. That's a very important aspect. So, that'll be fine. Aren't we happy for them? &gt;&gt; Amen. Let's give the Lord a a hand. We appreciate his provision. Amen. I know they've been praying and desiring a place for quite some time. As the Sunday school children come in, Brother Ellie's going to come and bless us with a special this morning. So, if Brother Ellie could come in, and I think the Sunday school children are ready to come in this morning. Why don't we just sing uh Lord, I lift your name, your holy name. Lord, I lift your name. your holy name. your home God, the great I am, the lamb, my comfort. earth and he Lord I live your name your holy name Jehovah God &gt;&gt; is Oh, the great I am the lamb. I come. [Music] In this tri when Christ from glory has already descended, many hearts are failing and filled with fear. We know the end time is already here. So just be faithful, believe his word, stay with the message that you have heard, listen to his prophet, his message he walk in the light where they still live in every church has shown bright to help God's people are true to find in this light Search it. A star shine bright. So friend, receive it. Walk in the light. So just be faithful. Believe his word. Stay with the message that you have heard. Listen to his prophets. His message here. Walk in the light where they start to live. Do not be fearful or filled with dread. Your prophet sleep. He is not dead. The bride is waiting. Now for that voice, the voice in you for this home. We can now rejoice. &gt;&gt; So just be faithful. Believe his word. Stay with the message that you have heard. Listen to his prophets. His message he walk in the light where this th live. His word of promise he gave the bride from the white charger. Abraham cried yet more one time shall I ride this trail to say the Lord only can never pass. I look and see are throwing picture they move so hard and selfish came but remember this this message came for you not for somebody else not for somebody else it is for you it depend on the revelation you may get and don't be sober but you may stay sober if you want but same spirit that rise Christ from the death if it is in you you will not care who is right left whatever okay so I'm still singing [Applause] I look and seeing picture the world is most for selfish care they hold his hand for his life and comfort no see they don't see his soul The end is here. It's now at the bride is gathering. The world is failing. Is awakening. Nations are breaking our brand and to we believe the end. Have you considered the end message? Have you considered Malachi 4, Revelation 10:7 and say Luke 17 proclaim this message now and they are forever more. The end is here. It now the bride is gathering. The world is failing. Is awakening. Nations are breaking our brand and to as we believe the end is here. Sir is the time Brana spoke of the angel came with a shout. The mountain sure as the voice cried out time is no more loud and the shadow went for the end is here. It's now our turn. The bride is gathering. The world is failing. Isire awakening. Nations are breaking. Abraham to as we believe at the end is God bless. &gt;&gt; Amen. Can't you see why I'm happy? Oh, can't you see [Applause] why I'm so happy? For I've accepted the word of the Lord, the revealed word that was spoken by the prophet of Malachi. Oh, can't you see why I'm so happy [Applause] I've accepted the word of the Lord. A revealed word that was spoken by the prophet of Malachi. [Music] I'm amazed. So we invite our pastor to come this morning. It's good to have our brother Tom back. &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise the Lord. Sister, God bless you. Good to have you back this morning. So, brother Aaron and heard brother Phillip on the phone. Different ones. Spiritual Israel visited natural Israel. Now, they've come back and they've brought some fruit, I'm sure, here this evening. Praise the Lord. So happy to be in the house of the Lord. It's good to have our pastor come and minister. The Lord has laid on his heart. Did it plant some expectation in your hearts when he came Wednesday evening after brother Murphy spoke and the Lord's already changing the direction? &gt;&gt; Amen. We appreciate the yielding to the Holy Spirit. We invite brother Biscoll to come this morning. Why don't we stand and sing this together? I'm amazed that you love me. I [Music] through your preious love I found for you. [Applause] And I saw [Music] wash away. All my sins are wash away. I'm that love me. How you [Applause] through your preious blood I found for you and my sins my [Applause] wash away all my Oh, I believe I believe that you love me. I believe that you through your preious love. I found part and my s are there. All washed away. All I see are [Music] &gt;&gt; what a glorious realization. &gt;&gt; Amen. I'm going to just sing that once again in a moment, but I had a a email first thing this morning and uh brother Milo was with brother uh Jonathan Larga and it said here we are in Croatia and brother Milco is with us and they're watching the service right now. So it's live streaming and he is interpreting for others I would imagine that are of the Croatian language and then on Thursday they will fly to Macedonia and you've read in the Bible about Macedonia. That's where Paul went. So they're going to be having services there. uh they don't know of any believers there as yet, but I told you I think last week of the of brother Jonathan putting profile of brother Bam's message on the Facebook and they had a number of inquiries of people from Macedonia and so they're going to be with them I believe and take the message down there. Isn't it wonderful? Wonderful to have a part of it, isn't it? &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. And tonight we're going to hear about the believers that are in Israel and the meetings that brother Tom, Sister Joanne had there, brother Milo, Brother Phillip, Brother Aaron were also there. And so we're happy to do whatever we can to strengthen and edify and build up the body of Jesus Christ. That's what we're here for and we're all part of it. We build up one another, we strengthen one another. And we're just so thankful for that. Amen. Let's just sing that chorus once again. I'm amazed. [Music] [Applause] &gt;&gt; Let's give him praise now. [Applause] How you through your preious love I found in you and my all my sins are give him praise once I'm amazed that you love me. I'm [Applause] [Music] through your preious blood. party and my sins. Oh, they're all they're all washed away. All my sins are [Music] &gt;&gt; just before we turn to the word, let's just bow our heads in prayer. Prayer is always in season. Father, I'm approaching you now through the name of Jesus Christ, the beloved son of God, our redeemer, our savior, our healer, and whatever needs may exist here in this sanctuary today or whatever needs may exist in all of the places where this uh service is being streamed right now. I pray, oh God, that hearts of men and women everywhere, young people and even children everywhere will realize that God is nigh to them. And as we speak, Lord, the things you've placed upon my own heart today, I pray that it will be quickened by the same Holy Ghost, the author of this word. In the name of Jesus Christ, bless speaker and hearers, we pray. Amen. Amen. God bless you. Thank you for standing. I'll have you open your Bibles please to Matthew 24th chapter. And we know that Matthew 24 have special place in the seals spoke of the spoke of the seals in the first part of it. But we're going to go to verse 31. And he shall send his angels and a great sound of a trumpet and they shall gather together his elect from the four winds and from one end of heaven to the other. I was listening to brother Ellie singing and he kept singing about repeating the gathering of the bride. I thought that was quite a confirmation. Now learn a parable of the fig tree when his branch is yet tender and putteth forth leaves. Know that the summer is nigh. So likewise ye when you shall see all these things, know that it is near, even at the doors. Verily I say unto you, this generation shall not pass till all these things be fulfilled. Heaven and earth shall pass away, but my words shall not pass away. &gt;&gt; If you'll turn then please to Genesis the 49th chapter. Going to just read one verse there. Jacob speaking of his uh sons and he asked them to gather themselves together in verse one that I may tell you that which shall befall you in the last days. And then in verse 49, he says, "The scepter shall not depart from Judah, nor a lawgiver from between his feet until Shiloh come, and unto him shall the gathering of the people be. The scepter shall not depart from Judah, nor a lawgiver from between his feet until Shiloh come. And unto him shall the gathering of the people be. And I want to take those that last phrase as a text for the morning service. And unto him shall the gathering of the people be. May God bless his word as you have your seats. In questions and answers, brother Brandham said, "Now the gathering will be unto the Lord." Shiloh was a place, but Shiloh was also a person. It must be because it said unto him. But Shiloh was a place in the Bible. was one of the uh notable cities when brother Brandham preached uh why little Bethlehem he said yes why little Bethlehem because it could have been at Gilead or it could have been at uh Shiloh or one of the other notable cities, notable places of worship and they did go up to Shiloh to worship. But he went on to say, "When Shiloh comes, and the gathering will be unto him, there will not be a lawgiver uh from between the feet until Shiloh come," speaking of Judah, "and to him shall the gathering be." There's uh untold numbers of of gatherings in the world. Uh there's gatherings both large and small and I am wanting to just begin the service this morning uh but by asking why are we gathered here and what has gathered you here? Uh what is it? Is it uh you know is it a friend? Is it family? Is it what is the gathering? And I want you to just keep that in mind. There's uh large and small gatherings. There's political gatherings, religious gatherings, sports gatherings, entertainment gatherings. And then when these great, you know, mobs of people or crowds of people gather, I think it's a I think it's a a a worthy question. You know, what has gathered these people here? Um, I have a few slides and I want to just sports event. So, something's gathered them. Brother Beam talks about people getting into the spirit of something. So, they're in the spirit of something. I don't even know what event it is and I'm not concerned about it. This is the freedom march in Washington and a lot of people gathered there. They probably traveled uh on trains and flew on planes and spent a lot of money and staying in motel. So they feel that there's some worthy uh objective for them to be there. And then uh we have also spiritual gatherings. This is a Billy Graham meeting. And we could have gone on and on and on with this, but we're I just want to make a point. All these people have gathered. The Bible says, "I'll send my me I'll send my angels and they will gather." Brother Brandham said, "Brother Billy Graeme is a messenger." And he gathered uh tens of thousands and into the millions of people when it when it becomes a total. Now, here's a gathering. And these are prisoners of war in a war camp. This is in 1945. Uh I want to make a distinction between these other gatherings which I just showed and they are people went there of their own valition. &gt;&gt; They went there of their own accord. And there there is uh to be understood there's a certain degree of oneness. We are all here to see this sports event. We are all here to hear this musical group. And so people gather and they have a oneness and a unity of of intent and objective. Now these men that are here are all prisoners of war and none of them wanted to go there. They are in one place. They are unified in in I would imagine unified in one thought and that is we want to get out of here. I think that we are unified in that thought. &gt;&gt; We want to get out of here. Amen. &gt;&gt; This place here probably was a bit of a pest house with rodents and fleas and bed bugs and whatever more and they want to get out of there. So, they didn't go there uh of their own valition. This is a group of people. These are Jewish women that have been gathered up. They didn't want to go to the ghettos. They didn't want to be torn from their children and families. They have arrived at a death camp. They don't know perhaps it's a death camp. They have been reduced from uh almost dehumanized but this was a long process and I won't want to get into that but this is another group which they have gone a wee bit further into the process. They have had all of their hair removed. I had pictures of huge bales of hair and I have been in Awitz more than once and have seen uh what was which they had not bailed up yet and piles of toothbrushes and combs because they dehumanized them and took away combs, took away toothbrushes and it was all a process to make them feel almost uh unhuman. And I have been with people. I've met quite a few of the survivors and one became a very very good friend of mine in Toronto and his mark was branded in his hand, his number which he could not possibly get out. And uh he didn't really want to speak of those things because it was such a process. And here's a group of men. Now these men, none of these people wanted to be there. They're not unified in desire of wanting to be there. I would say they're unified in the desire to get free from there. And this is them as s not the same men, but these are some by by uh survivors. One is holding his metal tag on this side. And of course it becomes much more gruesome than that, but I'm not going to go into that. Uh these were some of the uh young people. And uh these were children. They're all behind the barbed wire and they don't know what their future. And this is another group. I told you this would be a little different service. Satan put them behind that barb wire, but God allowed him to do it. Satan inspired dictators &gt;&gt; and violent men filled with hatred, filled with vengeance and filled with death, the spirit of death and slew untold millions of these people, &gt;&gt; none of them wanting to go. It was a mark on a whole face, a wound on the whole face of the entire earth and one that everyone vows we never want to see again. But I can tell you those same spirits are alive and well yet today. And they've got more ways to take people down into but these people that you see behind these walls or behind this bar of wire and see them. God has white robes for them. &gt;&gt; And you would never have a preacher be able to tell you that unless you got a prophet that could see into the word of God. &gt;&gt; And here's what we read. I think that's just one of the things that's holding this nation, speaking of America, together because they've always respected the Jew. Give him a place. You honor a Jew and God will honor you. Now, there's a bunch of Jews that's renegade just like there's Gentiles the same way. But the real Jew, God's put his name on the book before the foundation of the world. And here he was murdered down in this time. And remember, think of it now how perfect this is. Right after them millions of slaughtered Jews, innocent people by the nations of the world. Here the scripture says right in this time that there each one under the altar realized uh what has happened and they are given white robes. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And the scripture says the scripture says and when he had opened the fifth seal I saw under the altar the souls of them that were slain for the word of God. Now please notice the scripture is is different in the book in revelation. It speaks about those who held the testimony of Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; These are not holding the testimony of Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; The scripture says that they were slain for the word of God. &gt;&gt; They are those uh that that the apostle Paul says they the covenants have come by them. The law has come by them. The patriarchs came by them. And and all of the Old Testament came by them. So whatever spirit put these behind uh these kind of uh death camps. And listen friends in Europe there was I have volumes I have volumes entire volumes. I have construction plans and the volumes of how some of these places were built and then expanded and the and the movement of the people and the exact count of those that were killed in certain locations before they even got to death camps. There was a thousand at least a thousand 1,000 killing places in Europe in the Ukraine and in Poland and all of those countries. God had something else in his mind. He did not sovereignly. When I say he did not sovereignly, it was not as though he sent his spirit and moved on them to gather into death camps. They were gathered there the same as Pharaoh had had the people and brought them into slavery in in in in uh in Egypt. &gt;&gt; And they were not there willingly. He gathered them there. But God said to Pharaoh, "I raised you up &gt;&gt; and I gave you the power and hardened his heart so that he would hold those people so that God would manifest his strength and deliver them out." &gt;&gt; God has permitted Satan to come to this era in this day that you're living in. This is Satan's Eden &gt;&gt; and it is filled with darkness. &gt;&gt; It is Le Oysia and there isn't a power, there isn't a hope of you ever getting out of here outside of God's program. And I find it this very very significant and unique that while these people are being uh gathered while they're being gathered into into these places right at the same time while they're being gathered here and then something comes over them that we must have a homeland. We must go home. We must go home. At the same time, there's a people that are crying out to God that have they've seen all the churchity and all the religious and there starts to be movement. Uh there in the nations there can be league of nations and then a united nations and in the church world starts to be an ecumenical movement and then a world council of churches and there and a and a spirit of just kind of gathering gathering together because we uh there's some strength in in in some kind of union. So there's this union and the European Union and some other union and whatever more but it's not the answer. And then the religious one are gather were going to gather in a great big uh order of an ecumenical council. At that same time, God sends a voice. &gt;&gt; One single voice. &gt;&gt; And God, the spirit of God, like he moved over the whole face of the earth, moves over the whole face of the earth. &gt;&gt; He literally moves over the face of the earth. It doesn't happen in a corner. &gt;&gt; Friends, I want you to get my thought. When God said, "Let there be light." It wasn't light in just one zone or one time zone. It was light. And the earth turned. On one side, it was darkness. On the other side, it was light. Then God said, "Let the earth bring forth." And the earth brought forth all around the globe. All over the earth. And when the when the resurrection takes place, it's not going to be in one location. It's going to take place everywhere because the word of God already is in place to cause that to happen. &gt;&gt; And so God sends one single voice. It it it it it's irrelevant that the voice whether the voice was Isaiah and Israel or Elijah over there or Moses over there. We we've come under the effect of it in our time at the right time. We've come under the effect of those voices. God raised up a voice in this time. He raised up, Brother Brandham, in this time. Malachi 4, he raised up the voice. He raised up the voice of Revelation 10:7. It was one voice. But there was a strange thing happening. There was something that moved over over the people. Uh, and and people weren't even born yet. Something that moved over them that hungered for something. And and it was what came from this voice was the only thing that could satisfy that hunger. &gt;&gt; And so I want to say to you, that's why you're here today. &gt;&gt; That's why you've you've been gathered to that voice. &gt;&gt; And what's really remarkable, friends, I want you to really catch this is that these people here that are being uh driven to these death camps, it was you can never find such a strange and profound statement. and almost a paradoxical statement. It was the tender hand of Jehovah. &gt;&gt; How you how you going to say it's a tender hand of Jehovah? &gt;&gt; Tender hand of Jehovah. I said that to Gerson Solomon. I said it to Rabbi Richmond. This a this is the tender hand of Jehovah. Why? Driving them back to their homeland. You didn't catch that &gt;&gt; tender hand of Jehovah. &gt;&gt; You ought to see the stacks of corpses, the tender hand of Jehovah. And I said to Gerson Solomon, "Anything less than that would not have driven you people back." He said, "That's exactly the truth." &gt;&gt; I said, "God can only bless the Jew in their promised land, and God can only bless you in your promised land. You can't be someone just coasting along. God can only bless you in the promised land. I'm talking about now here comes a here comes a prophet messenger and begins to take the word of God begins to lay the word of God out. But in behind that comes the Holy Spirit quickening that word and making it alive. &gt;&gt; This is Mexico City. 1956. This is Durban, South Africa. And that's only a fraction. This whole section down here on the bottom where the where the horses raced is filled just like that. Choked the city. They were going to have a 10-day meeting and it ended up being a three-day meeting because it completely choked the city. We were lined up down the streets and the city couldn't hardly move. And this was one of the uh I say now all these people had gathered uh whatever gathered them but they many of them most of them did not hear the voice that you heard &gt;&gt; they went there they got healed they saw miracles I believe it was either it was in Durban brother Brennham told me that seven truck loads big steak truck loads farm trucks loaded with crutches and wheelchairs and and all manner of implements of the w of the injured and the infirmed and driving down the street and people coming in behind singing uh I singing only believe only believe now that was their their gathering. Okay, now we can end that off please. And when he had opened the fifth seal, &gt;&gt; he saw under the altar. So under the altar souls of them that were slain for the word of God and for the testimony which they held. And they cried with a loud voice, saying, How long, O Lord, holy and true, dust thou not judge and avenge our blood on them that dwell on the earth? and white robes were given unto every one of them. And brother Brandham brings out very clearly, if they were righteous and had been believing on Jesus Christ, they would have already had white robes, but white robes were given unto them. &gt;&gt; We haven't got time to go into all the the questions that there could be. And it was said unto them that they should rest for a little season until their fellow servants also and their brethren that should be killed as they were should be fulfilled. In the sixth seal, he said, "And and those Jews coming in from all over the world, everywhere being gathered over there," because now in the sixth seal, he's referring to those that have gathered as a result of this. they gathered what drew them there was there was no great uh program to attract them to Israel or to Palestine. In fact is Britain and the uh I don't know whether the League of Nations or whoever more were there and blockaded them and they arrived with chips and they wouldn't allow them to even unload &gt;&gt; but they were driven &gt;&gt; with the same Holy Spirit that you're being driven &gt;&gt; because they had to fulfill a certain part of the scripture. They had to return back and at the same time that Israel is being made a nation. Here the world is receiving another voice. &gt;&gt; Why? Because once again the even the type of the scripture has to be perfectly and this may not be just elementary ABCs but I hope that you'll get it. And if you don't write a note down I'll be happy to try and answer it. But it had to happen at that same time in in or orchestrated the Holy Spirit only he could orchestrate it so that Naomi who's the Orthodox church is going back home while a voice has come out to get the gentile bride Ruth to get her gathering because she has to be moving towards her home at the same time. &gt;&gt; It has to be in unison. Naomi and Ruth go back together. &gt;&gt; It had to be a a prophet coming to the Gentiles to gather the bride &gt;&gt; while Naomi is going back home &gt;&gt; at the same time. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. [Music] It &gt;&gt; says after England and had went in there during the time of General Allenbe in the in the decline of the world's war, then they give it back to Israel and she's been growing as a nation. And now notice now remember I just said Naomi and Ruth have to go back to redemption together. And here's a prophet saying, "And now she is a perfect nation." &gt;&gt; You may not have even been called when this was spoken in 63 in the opening of the seals. You may not have even been called. You may not have even been born yet. But God is an eternal being. &gt;&gt; His word is absolutely eternal. It is time locked. And what he speaks of a certain age or a certain time or certain generation or certain people, that word remains effective till the last one of those people are in and believe it. &gt;&gt; And he said, "And now she's a perfect nation." I will say the holy nation is a perfect nation. It's a perfect nation. The bride of Jesus Christ is a perfect nation. He said she's a perfect nation. her own money, her own currency, her own flag, her own army, and everything else. She has everything that she has need of. &gt;&gt; When the message was finished, the bride of Jesus Christ had everything she has need of. &gt;&gt; You are absolutely equipped, fully equipped. You have everything you have need of to take you from here to there. in whatever part of the journey you're in. Some may still been back in Europe, but they had everything they needed because because God had moved upon the the nation of Israel, upon Naomi's part, and a nation was created, and they could go back home. And the nation opened their arms, said, "Come back home. As soon as you land at the airport, you've got a place to go. You've got clothes to wear. You might come here almost ragged and naked, but you've got a home. You may have come where you had no food. You may have gone back as many of them did back to their homes in Europe, wherever it was in Europe. And many of them were in the Poland, Ukraine, and Germany and Austria and so on. They were all over. They were scattered. But the word says, "I'll scatter you." &gt;&gt; And the word says, "And I'll gather you." &gt;&gt; God just spoke that. He could have spoke it centuries ago, thousands of years ago. It was still effective in 1947. in 1948 1945 and I met uh I met an old Jewish man Kaman his his name was and he never got caught in this because in 1939 when they were just devising this plan he said I was of four sons and my father had a successful tailoring business but something came over me that I must return here to Palestine and he came there and and became the uh uh the initiator or or or the originator of one of the kabutzas where we where we happen to stay. I and my family stayed there. And what is remarkable friends is that I stood there looking at him realizing that there was a a divine movement &gt;&gt; to gather him &gt;&gt; to gather him to where he had to go. according to the scripture, he had to go there. And the 144,000 will be there. &gt;&gt; They are the ones that God has uh selected. &gt;&gt; And so you remember that they go together. He said in the 10 virgins, the real Jews are gathering into Palestine again. And just exactly what the prophet said, &gt;&gt; as Ishmael and Isaac were at one another's throats, their fighting uh predicted they'd be there in the last day. And there they set Ishmael out there and about a city block here. And here's Isaac. And both of them, he said, Muhammadans and Jews are fighting one another in no man's land. In the message, you must be born again. He said, "I'm wondering this morning as we are gathered here, and I have I'm reading this because this is this is out of my heart. I'm wondering this morning as we are gathered here together, brothers and sisters and you ministers and Sunday school teachers and whatever you are, what does this all mean? &gt;&gt; Why are we here? And what's the great struggle? That's right. &gt;&gt; Doesn't that fit everybody? &gt;&gt; Doesn't that fit everybody? &gt;&gt; Why are we here? &gt;&gt; And I am asking that question because I want to also answer it because you were compelled by a strange spirit from another world, &gt;&gt; from almighty God. &gt;&gt; You were compelled. You were directed in a in a way that you it was even mysterious to you. Some of you have come from different countries, from different parts of the world. How amazing that God has done it. And not because this is the only place. God works in one place and he works over the whole world at the same time. He said, "Let there be light and there was light." &gt;&gt; I want you to remember that God speaks his word. It's effective over the whole earth. &gt;&gt; God can speak about the resurrection. He can speak about it whether it be in America or in Palestine. And it's going to happen. If he has it in his mind that not just one is going to come up, but the whole body is going to come up, then that's what's going to happen. &gt;&gt; And God's already knows exactly who's coming up in the first resurrection. &gt;&gt; And he knows who's coming up in the general resurrection. He knows all about it. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; You following me? &gt;&gt; And so we're gathered to one. Thank you, brother Ellie, for your song. &gt;&gt; Just want you to be mindful of this now and others that heard it. We're gathered here to one who spoke from another world. &gt;&gt; If you're gathered here just to hear me or another one of the ministers speak, it's really the wrong purpose. Amen. &gt;&gt; It doesn't fully answer &gt;&gt; how you have been led. &gt;&gt; We've been gathered here because there is one true God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And he has given abundant and infallible infallible I say infallible evidence of his personal being and presence. We are here because that one has called us from another realm. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; From another world, &gt;&gt; from another place, another dimension, &gt;&gt; for the purpose of receiving us to himself, &gt;&gt; that's why we are here. &gt;&gt; We're not here to have a church. &gt;&gt; We're not here just to have services. We're not here to have some formal kind of religion. We have left the formal religion. We have left the old dead formal religion. We are here because someone living has called us from another world and that we've heard that voice &gt;&gt; and we're here and we've felt his presence &gt;&gt; and we know his reality. &gt;&gt; We can say it's a message. We say it's Christ. We can say some say it's the Bible. I can say it's Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; He's the word and the word was made flesh and dwelt among us. And that word said he'll send Malachi for and he sent a prophet messenger in this time with infallible proof. &gt;&gt; Infallible proof &gt;&gt; with a voice even till a man could say it's not my voice. It's it's someone else speaking. You've heard my voice, but it's not me speaking. &gt;&gt; I don't know these things. It's that one of all wisdom &gt;&gt; and all knowing that has called you and that's why you're here. If we're here for any other reason, then we've missed the point &gt;&gt; and we actually stand in jeopardy. This one has revealed has been revealed as the Lord Jesus Christ and is now gathering is now gathering has been and is gathering us to himself. &gt;&gt; You young people, you didn't come just to a young people's meeting or to a Sunday school. You've come because your teacher has heard this voice and is and your parents have heard this voice have heard this message and are seeking to bring it to you. Bring it making it a reality to you. &gt;&gt; There's more taking place this morning, even at this time that in the unseen world &gt;&gt; than we can even begin to imagine or understand. And we need to be mindful of it. Even though we can't put it all together, we need to be mindful of it. &gt;&gt; You say, "Well, Brother Biscll, you're taking me way beyond my, you know, I I want something down here that's going to help me live today, tomorrow, and the next day." I'm trying to speak so to make sure you get on the other side. &gt;&gt; I'm trying to speak. You didn't come here by your own choice. You didn't say, you didn't have a choice. Same with the prisoners of war. You're in a trap. Brother Brandham says about the women of this age, he says, "They're caught in a web and I feel sorry for them." &gt;&gt; Aren't your sisters glad someone felt sorry for you? &gt;&gt; You're caught in the web. You you know the the whole the whole thing is contra. If you want to live holy, this isn't the place. &gt;&gt; If you want to live a clean, holy, righteous life, everything in this world is opposed to that. If you want to just give yourself to to the darkness and to the world and the perversion, then you can you're at home. &gt;&gt; But if you're if you say I have a call and that call within me is for a holy God. &gt;&gt; And as when I pray, I don't pray as a formality. I say, let thy kingdom come. [Applause] &gt;&gt; Let thy will be done on earth as it is in heaven. Let righteousness rain. &gt;&gt; Let purity rain. &gt;&gt; Does your soul cry out for that &gt;&gt; because that's what tells you you're not for this place. &gt;&gt; You didn't come here by your own choosing. &gt;&gt; You didn't come here as an accident. Your mother and father and the mother who bore you didn't even know. She didn't know what you were going to be like. God knew what you were going to be like. And God even saw your footsteps and saw your pathway and saw how you would make contact with this one or work or fly to that place or whatever more. He knew exactly how he was going to get you. But it's for us to be aware. This came from another world. &gt;&gt; And God sent a messenger that was in constant contact with the other world. Why did he do that? Because it was not it was not a man calling you. It was not a man orchestrating it. It was another movement from another realm say, "I'll pull them to me. &gt;&gt; I'll call them to me." &gt;&gt; I don't leave you comfortless. I will come to you. That's the same one. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; He said, "In my father's house are many mansions. If it were not so, I would have told you. I go to prepare a place for you. And if I go and prepare a place for you, I will come again and receive you unto myself. How does he receive you? By sending his angel, his messenger. I'll send my messengers and they'll gather the elect &gt;&gt; from the four corners of the earth. &gt;&gt; From the four winds, wherever they are, &gt;&gt; I'll gather the elect, &gt;&gt; and nothing could stand in front of their place. Apostle Paul said, "While we look at the things which are not were which are seen, while we look, I'm sorry. While we look not at the things which are seen, but at the things which are not seen, for the things which are seen are temporal." Everything you see is temporal. &gt;&gt; You see my body, it's temporal. We look at one another, we're temporal. We're just on a little journey, friends. &gt;&gt; This building here is just temporal. &gt;&gt; Everything you see is temporal. &gt;&gt; But you have a soul inside you that's worth a million worlds. &gt;&gt; You have a seed in you &gt;&gt; that came from God. &gt;&gt; If you have eternal life, you always had it. &gt;&gt; There's no beginning to eternal life. There's no end to it. You always had it. And that life called out for father. &gt;&gt; Father, you sent me. What am I doing here? &gt;&gt; Potter, you sent me here. &gt;&gt; Father, &gt;&gt; what is this all about? &gt;&gt; What do you want me to do? What is my mission? And we we need to be conscious of the gathering the people. Who is gathering us? What are we being gathered for? And what are we being gathered to? Apostle Paul said in Romans 10:8, "And what sit? The word. The word is mighty." Now I'm going to go off into some swimming water and you can just I I can't answer all the questions but I do I want to pose some. The word is nye even in thy mouth and in thy heart that is the word of faith which we preach. &gt;&gt; And I've put here whatever that phrase means the word. We hear it hundreds and thousands of times. The word this and the word that and the word something else. And I think it possibly could have be used in different in different uh settings. Jesus answered and said unto them, "Verily I say unto you, if you have faith and doubt not, you shall not only do this which is done to the fig tree, but also if you shall say, &gt;&gt; Amen. unto this mountain, be thou removed, and be cast into the sea, it shall be done. &gt;&gt; That's the words of one who cannot tell a lie. &gt;&gt; That's the words of Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; Not that we're on a mission. Of course, I know that we do things according to the will of God. But the but there are some things that we know are the will of God concerning our families, concerning the place where we worship, concerning our individual lives. We know what the will of God is concerning that. And there's every kind of force, every kind of influence, every kind of lying spirit, everything in the everything that even the mind of Satan can contrive to offset you and derail you. &gt;&gt; I say this word has power over all of that. And it's not God's intent that his children are bound and subjected to all the influences and the pressures of Satan's kingdom. &gt;&gt; My father, your father, created the whole universe. &gt;&gt; And if it's expanding, so be it. &gt;&gt; If there's more galaxies to come, so be it. But my father did it. &gt;&gt; Amen. In the beginning, God created the heaven and the earth. In the beginning, the one I worship created the heaven and the earth. In the beginning, my father, &gt;&gt; Papa God, created the heavens and the earth. &gt;&gt; The one I came from created the heavens and the earth. The one who has sent his own special messenger with a voice to attract me, my father, my father, Papa God. He's the one who did that because he wants me to come home &gt;&gt; and I'm not happy here. &gt;&gt; I'm not pleased. I'm not at home down here. &gt;&gt; This world, this world is not my home. I'm just passing through. &gt;&gt; Satan wants to bog you down. He wants to make you completely occupied with this place. And you're going to live here a very short time. I don't care what age you are. You're going to live here a very short time. We're not home here. &gt;&gt; We haven't been gathered behind this barb wire. &gt;&gt; On our own accord. &gt;&gt; We've been sent here. And even God himself allows Satan to put you in the fix that you get into. And you it's a whole lot less than the barb wire and the death camps that some of these people were in. But God allowed you that he might manifest his power in you and show you that he can deliver you and keep you. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah to God. &gt;&gt; I'm going to give him praise today, friend. &gt;&gt; Right in the face of the enemy. &gt;&gt; This is a devil's world. &gt;&gt; And he is he he's God of this evil age, the scripture tells us. But he's not God of us. &gt;&gt; And we're not here because he did anything. &gt;&gt; We're here in spite of him. We're here because our father said another voice [Music] &gt;&gt; along this line. I'm going to watch watch my time and not be long, God willing. But I'd like to just take it from a little different direction for a moment. I'd like to put the emphasis upon the voice, the word of God. In the beginning, God created the heaven and the earth, and the earth was without form and void, and darkness was upon the face of the deep. And the spirit of God moved upon the waters. I want, please just stay with my thought and as little movement as possible. And the spirit of God moved on the face of the waters, on the face of the deep. And the spirit of God moved upon the face of the waters. And God said, "Let there be light." And there was light. Brother Brandham said, "If a fog came, it wasn't the word of God." If something else happened, it wasn't the word of God. Let there be light and there was it. It may not have come then. might not have come for 10,000 years, I don't know, or hundreds of years. But he said the reason he said that was because there was seeds. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And the seeds Now, now here's where we where we maybe get a little bit in the swimming water. I don't know, did God speak Hebrew or or was there anything audible or who did he say it to? There was nothing living. I don't know. But there's there's there's an essence. There's something God is beyond all of our comprehension. But there's something that was able to the essence from his thought and mind moved out into a into a logos. The logos was the word and moved out of the bosom of God. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And through this and that was called the son of God. and he be to create things. I can't put it down perhaps in in precise and define it exactly so but let us just say that the word of God in whatever that phrase comprises and whatever it involves the word of God however whatever essence or substance if it was a substance perhaps there was no substance yet but something came out from this great eternal being who fills all time and space who you can't and I can't comprehend neither can any man comprehend But something moved out of this being and said, "Let there be light." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And once that was once that was issued out of God, &gt;&gt; in whatever form it came, audible or inaudible &gt;&gt; uh or whatever language or no language, whatever came out from God, then one thing is certain, that precise thing is going to take place. Yeah, &gt;&gt; that's the point I want to make. It's going to take place. If you get that really solidly in your mind and then you know that it was that God speaking through this man, then you know that's going to happen. &gt;&gt; And then when you find these people or some people who begin to question that voice that came through this vessel, they are on dangerous ground. In fact is they don't have any crown. &gt;&gt; This is the only eternal being there is. &gt;&gt; There is no other eternal being &gt;&gt; other than God and his children. &gt;&gt; And there's none of the children that are going to say, "I don't think that was my father speaking." &gt;&gt; If it was the father speaking. Amen. &gt;&gt; The true word of God. I'm saying some things. I hope you will take it very seriously because I'm saying some things that I've pondered and wrestled with. The true word of God possesses transforming power. &gt;&gt; Amen. within it &gt;&gt; to bring about whatever was issued in that word thought. [Applause] It has within it wi-i contained within that word and it may not be an English word, a Hebrew word or any word but it is the thought of God that came into word form &gt;&gt; and the that that word itself possesses within itself the power to transform &gt;&gt; and to make what was in his mind. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. It may come in seed form but it will end up in the full form of full manifestation. It might be a grain of when he said let the herb bring forth. He had wheat and barley and rye and every kind of plant and herb and and tree and fruit tree and let the seed and let the life be in the seed. &gt;&gt; Let it be in its own seed so that it can reproduce and bring forth. All of that was in the mind of God once it was spoken. And the prophet said, "The reason why he said, "Let there be light," is because those seeds were laying down there. &gt;&gt; When he died at Calvary, your seed was laying someplace. &gt;&gt; And he had to go to Calvary to redeem and bring light to that seed. &gt;&gt; And there may be another seed. There may be another one that this light has not struck. And that light, oh my God, help me. But that light, he said, when you live the manifestation of the word by revelation to you, then you become light. &gt;&gt; And you have to cast that light on some seed that hasn't even come yet. &gt;&gt; But we are going to fulfill our purpose. &gt;&gt; We're going to fulfill our call. As the father hath sent me, so send I you. Now, do you know where I was coming from? &gt;&gt; As the father hath sent me. And that's why at Calvary when and and the brutality of of the cross and and the how they were extinguishing his life and finally he could say, "It is finished." &gt;&gt; And hung his head and gave up the ghost. Why? because the spirit that was in him had fulfilled every last iota of the promise &gt;&gt; concerning him. &gt;&gt; But what was concerning him is not concerning you. You and I have our part to play. &gt;&gt; And I want to say today before God Almighty, Father, help us to realize and help these people to realize and help them to confess we shall fulfill our part. every part. I will not lax back. I shall fulfill my part. &gt;&gt; Do I have your consent? &gt;&gt; We're not here just to fulfill a position, a place, a father or mother or carpenter or worker or whatever we are. &gt;&gt; We're here to fulfill a much greater purpose. &gt;&gt; And even as we do our daily activities, we are a light. &gt;&gt; You are the light of the world. He said, &gt;&gt; "So God spoke it." And what actually took place when God spoke it or what was involved in God speaking? His word is unknown. It's unknown to us. What, how, all of the aspects of it. But we do know that he spoke it. He said it. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; However, there was a materializing of what he said. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And then we saw what was in God's mind. &gt;&gt; There's a power in that act &gt;&gt; to produce precisely what God had in his mind. &gt;&gt; In the beginning, God spoke. It remains a mystery what the original act of speaking was. However, we have absolute evidence or proof that however it what and or however or whatever God spoke came into being. &gt;&gt; We are given to understand &gt;&gt; that by his word that his word are seeds &gt;&gt; and thus the seeds possess the power &gt;&gt; within themselves to transform from seed to fullness of life. &gt;&gt; Amen. Are you with me? &gt;&gt; The oak seed became an oak tree, not a palm tree. &gt;&gt; And the palm tree became an oak. It be a palm tree became a palm and not an oak. &gt;&gt; And he says in God's power to transform. Now he says now this word transformed. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It's something that's changed. &gt;&gt; It's to be changed. Transformed. Made different than what it was. Amen. &gt;&gt; Its character and everything has been changed in it to transform. &gt;&gt; Said this world was without form and void. Darkness was upon the earth. Nothing but a complete chaos. And when this world was in that condition, the spirit of God moved upon the face of the water. &gt;&gt; And the entire picture was changed from a total chaos to a garden of Eden. &gt;&gt; That was because there was an essence. There was a power within that spoken word to produce that. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I'm laying all this foundation. So, we come home to your address in just a few moments. And God said, "Let there be light." And there was light. That was God &gt;&gt; in Mark. And Jesus moved with compassion, put forth his hand, and touched him, and Seth and Seth unto him. He didn't say to the whole earth. He didn't say to all humanity. He said to him, "I will be thou clean." &gt;&gt; That's what he spoke. Be thou clean. Not in my language, not in your language, but in that language. So now God can speak in language. Brother Brandon says, "God can speak. God can hear. &gt;&gt; God can write. &gt;&gt; He wrote the commandments in stone. Oh, I tell you, he has technology that we know nothing about. &gt;&gt; And he said, "I will be thou clean." And as soon as he had spoken, &gt;&gt; now the Hebrew language doesn't have that power. The Galilean language doesn't have that power. &gt;&gt; Simple audible sound coming from a man's lips doesn't have that power. &gt;&gt; So where is that power? The word is nigh even in your mouth. &gt;&gt; That's what this book says. &gt;&gt; Let's not call the Apostle Paul a liar. &gt;&gt; Let's say the Apostle Paul is true. &gt;&gt; Let's say God, you spoke through him and that's true. &gt;&gt; And the prophet in this day took the same scripture and said, "Speak. &gt;&gt; Don't be backward." Right. &gt;&gt; I would like to see a congregation of people that were bold enough &gt;&gt; to speak what the Holy Spirit will give them faith to believe. &gt;&gt; And as soon as he had spoken, immediately &gt;&gt; the leprosy departed. What is this essence in this sound? What is this in this audible word that caused the whole cell system within a man's body and the lepers say left him immediately? &gt;&gt; This is our God. &gt;&gt; This is who brought this message. &gt;&gt; This is who's going to bring you and change your body. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And I'm preaching to give you faith to believe in that change because you've got to have faith to be raptured. &gt;&gt; We're preaching rapturing faith. &gt;&gt; You can stay here if you want. I don't want to stay here. I don't want to be in the tribulation. I don't want anything this world has to offer. Immediately the leprosy departed from him and he was cleansed. &gt;&gt; That's not a story. I read that. That's my father. &gt;&gt; That's your father. &gt;&gt; Your God. He came then to the tomb of a man. Now this was a living man who was cleansed. Now we have Lazarus in a tomb &gt;&gt; with a stone rolled over it. He's been there four days in that hot country and they don't embomb people. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And he is already corruption set in. The prophet said his nose is already collapsed in this man is rotting. And when he had thus spoken Jesus in 11th ch 11th chapter and when he had thus had and when he thus had spoken he'd said some words where have you laid him and when he had thus spoken he cried &gt;&gt; with a loud voice &gt;&gt; voice &gt;&gt; Lazarus &gt;&gt; come forth &gt;&gt; and he that had been dead &gt;&gt; something happened. You know what it was? The same word that said, "Let there be light," was here in a body &gt;&gt; on earth. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And death and Satan who had brought death had to become subject to him. &gt;&gt; And he reversed the power of Satan. He reversed the power of death and created again in him his organs and his body and his structure. And he came out. He could have said, "Come out loosed." &gt;&gt; But there was something for the people to do. When he came out, they had bound him. So he said, "Loose him." &gt;&gt; You loose him. &gt;&gt; Something for you and I to do. &gt;&gt; You confess it. &gt;&gt; You say it. &gt;&gt; Dust thou believe? You believe. &gt;&gt; Can you deny Satan? Deny him. &gt;&gt; He's lying to you. &gt;&gt; Deny him. He wants you to doubt this. deny him. &gt;&gt; That's the same God that spoke through this man we call our prophet William Brandham. The same God. &gt;&gt; That is why brother Wayey was raised from the dead. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Little fishy. &gt;&gt; God gives you life. &gt;&gt; And he flips over and continues to swim. &gt;&gt; Squirrel after be a squirrel. The same one that brought Lazarus up, brought a squirrel on edge, on the limb. And that same God's calling you out of this death camp. &gt;&gt; He's calling you out of this death camp. [Applause] &gt;&gt; Behind the barb wire of this world. And the son of God has set you free. &gt;&gt; Liberation time has come. Hallelujah. [Music] &gt;&gt; If thou can't believe, say to this mountain, &gt;&gt; that thing tried to control you, that spirit tried to lie to you, you tell him he's a liar &gt;&gt; and the father of lies, &gt;&gt; and you will not accept it. &gt;&gt; I won't have this spirit on me anymore. I won't have this devil &gt;&gt; try to trap my life any longer. &gt;&gt; When that prophet's message came and those people were liberated out of their out of their literal camp, that was a sign. That was Naomi's group. &gt;&gt; What about Ruth's group? &gt;&gt; Naomi got her inheritance, but Ruth got Boaz. &gt;&gt; Ruth got him. They got their land. They got their nation. They got their flag. But we got the redeemer. &gt;&gt; We got the lover. We got the Boaz. [Music] &gt;&gt; Oh, hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Just give me Jesus. &gt;&gt; Give me Jesus. &gt;&gt; Give me this living word. &gt;&gt; Give me this living spirit. giving me this breath of life. [Applause] &gt;&gt; Now that was in one specific location and Jesus had to journey there to come to that tool. Then Jesus said after his resurrection and he was getting ready to depart, he specifies another place and he says, "Now tarry in Jerusalem. &gt;&gt; Go to that city and you stay there &gt;&gt; until you're endued with power from on high." &gt;&gt; So a group of people, 120 of them of all that heard him, and there were many more that heard him. So it goes to show and it behooves us friends. &gt;&gt; It behooves us to be serious. &gt;&gt; Am I part of the 120? &gt;&gt; Or am I part of another group that just I heard the Galilean speak? Yes. And I knew supernaturally he had raised I knew he was a well I even I believe he was a prophet. There's people who say I'm in the message. I don't like that phrase. I'm not interested whether you're in the message. What is that? What does that mean? &gt;&gt; You've got to have this living word in you. &gt;&gt; You've got to be You got to have the message in you. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; I'm in the church or I'm in this or I'm in something else. Nonsense. &gt;&gt; Excuse me for being blunt, but I I'm going to just speak my heart. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; You got to have that word in you. Yeah. And &gt;&gt; if you have that word in you, you'll be living that life &gt;&gt; because that word, whatever it is, whatever that word is, it contains &gt;&gt; and has the very essence of almighty God, eternal power. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; You possess that. &gt;&gt; Now, there's a lot of people believe the Bible, but they don't have the word. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Understand? I'm making a distinction between just the mechanics. The letter kleth. In other words, what? The word kleth. &gt;&gt; Just the letter of the word kleth. But the spirit gives life. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And so he says, "Go to Jerusalem and tarry &gt;&gt; until you be endued." And the scripture tells us that they were gathered. They were assembled in one in one accord. And suddenly, &gt;&gt; there came a sound from heaven &gt;&gt; as of a rushing mighty wind &gt;&gt; and it filled all the house &gt;&gt; where they were sitting. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The same God could have said &gt;&gt; now could have spoke through Jesus and said, "Now I send the spirit, the promise of the father upon you and it'll just cover the whole earth." Well, it didn't do it right then. It came it came to the room where they were sitting and they were all filled and they were told, "Now you go and tell it." &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Say, "Oh, this is a glorious message." And God found me. Yeah, he did. He found you. He knew precisely where you were. And then he filled you for a purpose. And when you heard the word and it became alive to you, then he quickened you to go and tell it and to live it. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Why were they there sitting? Like why are you here sitting? Well, they were there sitting because they were expecting something. &gt;&gt; If you're just expecting church, that's just exactly what you're going to get. &gt;&gt; Well, I went to church this morning. Good for you. &gt;&gt; Have a happy two and a half hours or whatever. No, I went to church. &gt;&gt; I became transfigured. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. I received transforming power. In fact is I can't wait to get out of here and give that devil a black eye. &gt;&gt; I'm going to give him trouble. &gt;&gt; I'm getting on his case. &gt;&gt; I'm going on the offensive. &gt;&gt; Not on the defensive. Oh, you know, I've had such a hard time and oh, listen. Let's get over that. &gt;&gt; Everybody has a hard time. &gt;&gt; We've all had those times. But let's become on the offensive. I'm going after him. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; They had come under the voice of the creator. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Those that were sitting there had come under the voice of the creator. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Who made all things and they were sitting there waiting for the fulfillment or the transforming power of that voice to happen. &gt;&gt; Amen. And the Bible tells us, &gt;&gt; Peter speaking, "And he commanded us to preach unto the people, &gt;&gt; and to testify that it is he which was ordained of God, to be judge of the quick uh to uh to be the judge of the of quick and dead. To him give all the prophets witness, &gt;&gt; that though his name and through his name, whosoever believeth in him shall receive remission of sins, &gt;&gt; and while Peter yet spake, &gt;&gt; now Peter's speaking, &gt;&gt; it's not God said in the beginning. It's not Jesus. It's not Moses. Now it's Peter. &gt;&gt; Peter who just a few days ago cursed. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Amen. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Come on, holy, righteous ones. &gt;&gt; But now he was full of the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; He put that behind him. &gt;&gt; He never repeated it again. &gt;&gt; And while he spake these words, the Holy Ghost, that's the spirit of the creator. And the spirit of God moved over the face of the whole deep. Now that Holy Spirit, that spirit is right there in the room. &gt;&gt; And it says, "And the Holy Ghost fell on all them which heard the word." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; They weren't just hearing some words. They were hearing the word. &gt;&gt; Coming now through a vessel, &gt;&gt; a redeemed vessel &gt;&gt; full of the Holy Ghost. And while he spake, the creator, the spirit of creation came upon them that heard the word. &gt;&gt; Listen friends, if I'm speaking my own thoughts today, then it'll do nothing for you. If you receive it as something coming from God, you can receive something divine this morning. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; There were certain conditions. I'm moving forward as as quickly as possible now. There were certain conditions that would have to spread over the whole earth at the season or the time of the coming of the revealing of the son of man. heaven. &gt;&gt; And the scripture says Jesus speaking, "Heaven and earth shall pass away in Luke 21." Heaven and earth shall pass away, but my words &gt;&gt; shall not pass away. And take heed to yourselves, lest at any time your hearts be overcharged with serpenting and drunkenness and cares of this life, and so that day come upon you unawares. What day? &gt;&gt; What snares? &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. It says, "Heaven and earth shall pass away, but my word shall not pass away. For as a snare shall it come on all them that dwell on the face of the whole earth." You know, it could be taking place and probably is taking place at this moment. &gt;&gt; The earth is filled with violence. It's filled with the deepest and the most perverted uncleanness. &gt;&gt; Until godly people have a good reason to be concerned. Those of you with families, we're concerned about our families. We're concerned about our partners, our other brothers and sisters in Christ. We're concerned about them. As parents, we're concerned about our young people. We have good reason to be. This school building out here, that's not just a pile of concrete. I can tell you what. If we can preserve, if you can preserve your children from the influence &gt;&gt; of this world, &gt;&gt; my counsel to you is do so. &gt;&gt; Amen. If there's any possibility, if there's any possible way you can preserve them and you as other believers to do whatever you can do, I can tell you that Israel did not have the Canaanites and the Gegosites and the Perizzites and all the other itesites teaching their children that we'll trust them to you. That was not the case. This is only a sideline. I'm only just tossing that in for the moment. As a snare, it shall come on all them that dwell on the face of the earth. We could become very negative at this time. There's floods, there's earthquakes, there is nuclear nuclear meltdowns. There is contamination on our shores, on our beaches. I don't know if you've thought about it, but the salmon you eat and the salmon that I love to eat, it leaves our shores and these rivers, and it takes a 4-year journey to Japan. And Japan's waters are absolutely polluted with radioactivity for many, many miles out in the ocean. And for us to think that those salmon are going, nobody's told me this. I haven't read it. But if you think that our salmon going to swim and feed over there and grow to be from fingerlings to big salmon and come back and not be affected, we were listening to a tape this last week and brother Brandham speaks about the hybriding. Now he talks about the hybriding of food and what it does to our bodies. And I said to my wife, "That's why we pray, but we we we still do everything we can to eat healthy." But he says, "The hybriding of the food," he says it it it actually is destroying us and turning us just to unhealthy people. &gt;&gt; And he says, "And remember, the brain is also cells." He says, "The brain is also flesh." And you know, you look at brother Ed up here. I lived I lived till I was way into my adult life before I ever heard the word Alzheimer's. I lived till I was in high school before I heard the first case of leukemia. And that cancer is a demon of this age. For when an angel from God came and stands h in bodily form before our prophet and said, "I've been sent from the presence of God to tell you that you will take a ministry of healing to the world and you'll stand before kings and potentates and so on." and then over the Ohio River a voice nothing will stand before if you can get the people to believe &gt;&gt; nothing will stand before your prayers in other words nothing will stand before your words &gt;&gt; not even cancer &gt;&gt; why did an angel from God's presence say not even cancer it's a demon of this generation &gt;&gt; and we need to have a congregation of people that recognize that and believes against it. &gt;&gt; We're in opposition &gt;&gt; as a praying people. &gt;&gt; As a believing people, &gt;&gt; we're in opposition. &gt;&gt; We don't just want to call when we hear about it. We want to know now that we're against it. &gt;&gt; We're in opposition to it. Why? Because we have received the voice of the creator. &gt;&gt; The creator. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He could have said, "Let there be another galaxy." But he chose to say instead, "Not even cancer will stand before you." &gt;&gt; And I receive that word. &gt;&gt; I receive that word in the name of Jesus Christ before these people as a testimony. I'm not preaching. I'm making a declaration. I receive this message. [Music] Amen. &gt;&gt; We were speaking yesterday with some folks that are sitting right here and they have friends far far away. After 16 years in the message, they just left the message, went back to a Pentecostal church, I believe it was. So, how does this happen? Well, I can tell you one thing that happens for absolutely certain that message didn't become uh they weren't birthed by this word. &gt;&gt; And when you ever hear or see even evidence of people drifting back, I can tell you, you say what you wish, it's Orpa going back to her gods and her people again. The heart has gone back. &gt;&gt; Already gone back. May physically they maybe they could sit in a they could sit in a message church. Doesn't mean a thing to me. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Doesn't mean a thing. It's what's in your heart. &gt;&gt; And I'm seeking to plant into your very being. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The fullness of this word. And while one might say, and I've heard it said even recently, that the the Bible is their absolute, the message is no longer their absolute. That's a very dangerous statement. And I'll I'll tell you I'll tell you what I do with statements like that because I've heard those statements 30 years ago at where people make a distinction. &gt;&gt; They make a distinction between the Bible and the message. Yeah. &gt;&gt; Then I have a threeletter word and it's why. &gt;&gt; Why does that person or why does that group make a distinction between the Bible and the message? It's simply because and I'm giving you the direct answer and deep in their heart is because they do not believe that the message is the perfect revelation of the word of God. And they have their own thought that they want to interject which is different from the message and from the word. [Applause] &gt;&gt; Might as well say amen. &gt;&gt; It's absolutely the truth. &gt;&gt; Then that causes an individual to lift themselves up &gt;&gt; as someone who can give the interpretation of what this is as an absolute. If you're going to if you're going to say and I've said it myself when brother Brandham preached the absolute he held the Bible in his hand because the Bible is the absolute. But the second part of that is he said in this day we have the perfect interpretation of the Bible. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And that's why we immerse ourselves within the message of the hour because it is the perfect interpretation of the absolute. &gt;&gt; Hey, we've had the we've had the absolute for a thousand 2,000 years. &gt;&gt; And men have given their lives and they become theologians about this and they don't agree. They don't agree because they haven't got the author of the book. But now you have a messenger, but the author of the book speaking through him. &gt;&gt; And you know he's speaking through him because he tells you, tells me, tells others the very secret of their heart while the word is being spoken. You've experienced it. I've experienced it. &gt;&gt; And we have the secret of our heart. Then we have to conclude this wisdom comes from another world. &gt;&gt; And speak the word and the cancer falls off. &gt;&gt; A lot of people who don't believe the message get healing. Brother Brandham says prostitute will come up and get healed and a godly woman won't get healed because healing operates by faith and faith is a law. If you believe it shall be. doesn't say if you're a nice person, if you go to church, if you pay your tithe, if you're if you're free from sin, doesn't say that. Just says if you believe it, &gt;&gt; you'll be healed. &gt;&gt; So, the fact people have all kinds of miracles and so on, that's not it. But when you can speak a word and breathe a word that gives a perfect interpretation to the absolute, then you have an absolute. You have a you have something like it's an oath and it's sworn on the oath. &gt;&gt; Oh, I love that. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; I hope it sings indeed. &gt;&gt; And that's the only way we can do what we're called to do. where he said &gt;&gt; I finished the work &gt;&gt; that you sent me to do. &gt;&gt; That's where I was coming from last week. Now then we that's the only way we can say that &gt;&gt; I've received the same spirit. The author dwells in me &gt;&gt; and now I proceed with my life. And now let me say something just comes quickly to my mind. This is sent to the elect, to the chosen, to the I try to find. I'll just leave it. But when we say that we're elect, that doesn't mean that we're proud or that we are to be conceited. &gt;&gt; Has nothing to do with that. You just know who you are &gt;&gt; and you just go and live your life &gt;&gt; and live your life peacefully &gt;&gt; and go with that knowledge. This word came to me. &gt;&gt; This living Christ came to me. &gt;&gt; Luke 17:30, Malachi 4, whoever, whatever identification you want to give it, but it came to me. &gt;&gt; And I don't know about others. I will do all that I can do to be a light &gt;&gt; as he said in things that are to be the gene of your life. I quoted it from I'm quoting it from last Sunday. The gene of your life, the spiritual life tonight was in God the Father &gt;&gt; before there was even a molecule. &gt;&gt; You believe that? &gt;&gt; Before there was a molecule. &gt;&gt; The gene of your life, your spiritual life that's in you was first in God before there was a molecule. Before there was an earth, before there was anything. &gt;&gt; And he says, "And he also for ordained men." Amen. &gt;&gt; I'm sorry. And you are nothing but You are nothing but the manifestation &gt;&gt; of the gene of life that was in God as a son of God. &gt;&gt; And now you're expressed after his word has come into you &gt;&gt; to light up this age. How did his word come into you? It had to be said. It had to be spoken. &gt;&gt; And you were English or French or German or some other language and it came in your language. I had an experience. There was a pastor, a minister, well-known minister. Some of you know him very well. And I had about six or seven people. I had brother Leon, I believe it was, and brother Milco and several. And I felt to do that when I was in Missouri. I've only done it only did it here once and did it down there. And I wanted them all to speak Acts 2:38. Repent and be baptized every one of you in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of your sins and you shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost. And I had them all speak it in their own language. And there's hardly anybody understood. I had one woman in Missouri. She came up. I said, "What lang what what what language do you speak?" She says, "I speak four. Well, I said, "Let's just pick one of them." And so we had Romanian and Croatian or whatever. We had them put five or six lined up in French. And they all just blurt out these words and the people just they don't know what it is. Nobody's responding. pastor came to me after and he said that I traveled here for this answer. He said I was trying to wanting to do something for God. He says and I got I got a log jam. I just couldn't go any further because he says it was I thought that you know the the people will have to hear the the voice in their ear. But hey, most of the world doesn't understand English. They don't understand brother Bram's tapes. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Well, you say, "Well, it gets interpreted." Yeah, it gets interpreted. Now they're hearing completely different sound, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; But the same the same scripture produces the same thing because it's the essence of what's in that word. &gt;&gt; The transforming power is not in English. &gt;&gt; It's not in French. It's not in German or any other language. The transformation power is in the revelation of what was said. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Glory. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Is it okay? &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Aren't you glad he reached you? &gt;&gt; Amen. And I won't go any further because now we now we come to the point where I just thought it was just a perfect place to go into. And now God has allotted God. This same wise God and you can be thinking about this. I touched on it last Sunday, but he allotted. That's an allotment. He gave a specific allotment to you. No one else &gt;&gt; can live your part. &gt;&gt; Amen. The only part that I have a little struggle with is if we don't do good, well, the Bible speaks about rewards. So, the reward won't be the same. But you live fervently. the part that God and I want to establish this morning before we close that if you can get it resolved. I mean absolutely resolved that we believe this message because it came from another world. &gt;&gt; It came divinely sent. &gt;&gt; It came beyond man's wisdom. It came even beyond, as brother Benham says, went beyond his own his own better judgment. &gt;&gt; He thought things over, but it went beyond that. I thank God it went beyond man's wisdom. And he said it whether it fit the people or whether they like to what they heard or whether they as we heard in he speaking in Phoenix the other day and and and and preaching and I can tell you those people are so silent because he's blasting the denominations. Why? Because the denominations become those men's absolute and the word of God, the perfect interpretation of the word is coming right out of his mouth and they're rejecting it. They want like children, you know, pipe us a nice music and show us a sign and tell us the secret of our heart and heal somebody and oh, they get all taken with that. &gt;&gt; But that's not what it's about. It's about what he said. &gt;&gt; And the essence of the word that he spoke. &gt;&gt; Glory to God. &gt;&gt; Oh, we're so thankful. &gt;&gt; I'm so glad. &gt;&gt; I'm so glad for this word. Aren't you? Let's stand to our feet, shall we? &gt;&gt; Let's just take a moment &gt;&gt; to thank him. We thank you, Father. &gt;&gt; Thank you for sending it. Why don't you thank him for sending it to you? Forget who's beside you. You just thank him. Say, "Jesus, thank you for coming to me. Thank you for coming to me. Thank you for bringing it to me. Thank you for opening up my darkened heart, oh God, quickening me. I wonder if we could just sing like to sing that chorus. He came to me. He came to me. When I couldn't come to him, he came to me. [Music] If this is your testimony then you can you sing it as it is your testimony. [Music] to me. When I could not come to where he was, he came to me. [Music] That's why he died on Calary. [Music] When I could not come to where he was, he came to me. Now, before we sing it again, I want you to think while we even say these words. I'd like you to think in your own life, the spot, the place where it was that he actually came to you. I look back and see sister Sally Dodd Senior and her and brother Edwin and Sister Sally has a phrase all the time when he caught up to us. when he caught up to us and she has said it to us probably dozens and dozens of times and it was branded my heart when he caught up to us said to Sally great brother Edwin Forest we're so glad he caught up to you &gt;&gt; you were on your way and you were in you know all in the societies and all the rest of it that he caught up with you I know there's some when you were in your workplace and he caught up to you. I came into a a a petrol station in Cape Town, South Africa and there was a black man sitting there and he was sitting reading a a I looked he was reading this little pamphlet. I looked it was a message book. I opened the window and got out. I said it's a good book. Yes. He said that's a good book. I says, "Where'd you get it?" He says, "In the trash can." Somebody cleaned out their car and threw it in the trash can. So for one person, it was trash and the other person it was. It was a wonderful thing. &gt;&gt; He came to you. He came to me. [Music] &gt;&gt; He caught up with us. &gt;&gt; He came to me. Oh, he came to me when I could not come to where he was. He came to me and that's why he died. on Calary. [Music] When I could not come to where he was, he came for me. [Music] &gt;&gt; I'd like to sing a chorus of that song 468. Had it not been for a place called Mount Calvary, had it not been, it not been for a place called bound free. And had it not been for the old rock. And had it not been for a man called Jesus. And forever my soul will be. Oh, had it not been so thankful for a place called Mount Calary. and had it not been for the old rock. [Music] And had it not been for a man called Jesus, then forever my soul would be lost. Hallelujah. [Music] &gt;&gt; Thank you Lord Jesus. Thank you Lord for saving us. Thank you Lord for making me home. Thank you Lord for giving to me. I bring salvation so rich and free. Our dear Lord Jesus, I ask I'm asking expressly that you'll go with every person. Father, lift the heavy load. There are situations, oh God, that we that weigh heavy upon our heart and we ask you to intervene &gt;&gt; in a supernatural way. We agree and testify you're the Almighty. &gt;&gt; We speak your word by saying, "Greater is he that is in you than he that is in the world. Greater is he that is in you, church, than he that's in the world. You that might be down or you that might be almost at a place of defeat. I say greater is he that is in you." These are the words of Jesus Christ, your shepherd. Lord Jesus, I ask that you will be in attendance, be near. May your presence be felt. Oh God, I pray you'll change the atmosphere in homes. Change the atmosphere as the as your children move about. And may they realize that the one that is in them is greater than the environment. Greater than any opposition. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Greater greater is he. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Father. You're the creator. You even you even created Lucifer in the day he was created. And you'll be the one that'll destroy him. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; The tempter shall be destroyed. Thank you, Father. I pray in the name of Jesus Christ, you'll have a people on earth that will believe you, Lord, after all this evidence that has come after all this infallible evidence that has been you have presented to us that we'll believe it. &gt;&gt; With all of our heart and soul, Lord, let us be fanatics for the gospel. &gt;&gt; Glory to your name. &gt;&gt; You're worthy, worthy, worthy. And we want to go praising you. I pray that you'll give safe journey to the people that you'll bless the service tonight. Oh God, here and the service this afternoon in Seattle. Thank you for providing the place that you've provided just in the nick of time. Oh God, just when we needed it here, you provided it. Thank you, Father. Bless the people as they gather. And now as we're dismissed, thank you for all the kind attention of the people. I pray that you'll bless them for it in Jesus name. Amen. Amen. I want to say God bless you. Thank you for wonderful attendance this morning and all. I trust that you receive something. Amen. Take it. Maybe even want to hear it again. If you got a question, just put it down on a note paper and put it into the office and I'll try to do better. God bless you. You're dismissed in Jesus name. Greet one another. [Music] Thank you.
