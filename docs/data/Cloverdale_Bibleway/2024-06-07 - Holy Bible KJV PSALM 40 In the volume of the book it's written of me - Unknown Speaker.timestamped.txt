[0:00] Psalm 40 to the chief musician a Psalm
[0:03] of David I waited patiently for the Lord
[0:06] and He inclined unto me and heard My Cry
[0:09] he brought me up also out of an horrible
[0:11] pit out of the mey clay and set my feet
[0:14] upon a rock and established my goings
[0:18] and he hath put a new song in my mouth
[0:20] even praise unto our God many shall see
[0:23] it and fear and shall trust in the Lord
[0:26] blessed is that man that maketh the Lord
[0:28] is trust and respect eth not the proud
[0:31] nor such as turn aside to lies many oh
[0:34] Lord my God are thy wonderful Works
[0:36] which thou Hast done and thy thoughts
[0:39] which are to us word they cannot be
[0:41] reckoned up in order unto thee if I
[0:43] would declare and speak of them they are
[0:45] more than can be numbered sacrifice and
[0:48] offering thou did not desire mine ears
[0:50] hast thou opened burnt offering and sin
[0:53] offering hast thou not required then

[1:07] in the great congregation lo I have not
[1:10] refrained my lips oh Lord thou knowest I
[1:14] have not hid thy righteousness within my
[1:17] heart I have declared thy faithfulness
[1:19] and thy salvation I have not concealed
[1:22] thy loving kindness and thy truth from
[1:24] the great congregation withhold not thou
[1:27] thy Tender Mercies from me oh Lord let
[1:29] let thy loving kindness and thy truth
[1:31] continually preserve me for innumerable
[1:34] evils have compassed me about mine
[1:37] iniquities have taken hold upon me so
[1:39] that I am not able to look up they are
[1:41] more than the hairs of mine head
[1:43] therefore my heart faileth me be pleased
[1:46] oh Lord to deliver me oh Lord make haste
[1:50] to help me
