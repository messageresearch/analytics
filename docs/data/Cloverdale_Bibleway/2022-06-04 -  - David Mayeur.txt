========================================
brother biscuit would you come and say something please let's greet our dear path amen [Applause] we're so thankful for you each one and for those men that are here on the platform that have left their churches yes brother david meyer and son have come from switzerland brother tim pruitt and brother tim pruitt has said he said again at our table and i believe it with all my heart he said brother ron spencer is a miracle amen when he stands and preaches every week and i know something about that and he's the man who prayed a prayer when i was laying in the hospital and i suddenly i jerked my head because i knew my family was waiting and i said i don't know and i said out loud i don't know if i'm going to come out of there i had had brother ron spencer pray and i said i'll just call his cell you don't mind standing do you a few moments i'll call his cell and if he answers then i know that god is has put it together and i call his cell and i said brother ron i called you once for prayer now i'm calling you again for prayer the first time it was just a physical thing but this time it's a spiritual thing and i don't know whether i'm going to come out of this place and he said sure brotherhood and he prayed a prayer and he started to pray and i thought while he was praying i thought i'm going to hang on to the words because this is my turn the woman at the well it was her turn but now this is my turn and i brought it up to today and friends i moved i moved because god answered the prayer and i said i i prayed and i said would you have pray for me i have 14 blockages 90 in the main artery i have not told all of this and down to 30 in other and my cardiologist had a look at it and they said to my wife he said the man that did the bypass and he didn't turn on any of the bypass equipment he said this is off pump and that's what they said on the document it was an off-pump operation and they operated on my heart for three and a half hours and the chung was his name and i thought it was dr watson going to be doing the operation so i i just when brother ron spencer was praying he said anoint the person anoint he didn't even say the person or the man or the woman or the doctor he said anoint them anoint them so that they will rise to the challenge and i thought well i know who the person is is dr watson and i went back into dr watson's office or no i'm sorry i didn't go back into his office i was laying on the bed and he said unfortunately we have to leave i have to leave tonight and i will not be there to do your surgery i said who's going to do it he said dr chung he will be in charge of the i said dr watson you look awfully awful lot like a man that stood at the foot of my bed who was dr watson he said i am dr watson but i can't do your operation and he said we have great teams i said would you [Music] be standing there as i am laying here would you be as happy if dr chung was doing your surgery and the head of the team he said that was the only time he smiled he cracked a little smile and he said all of our people our teams are good and i said would you trust him with your life and he said yeah i think so i would i said that's good because he's the same yesterday today and forever and there was a sister here sister shirley brother james's wife and she's up in the recording room yes and i said to her sister shirley brother james i said to her i've missed you i miss you from seeing your face and she said i'm up in the recording room and i am doing it in chinese for the chinese people and i said praise god god bless you god bless you brother james and andy and i know that it's right it's right that shirley should be up there and i know it was right and dr chung he was ready to do the surgery for me and he i want to say this my daughters were there and they tapped real quick and my for my wife's sake and brought up the google search and brought up dr chung's name and he got famous by transplanting three human hearts in one evening and that was a fifteen he stood on his feet for 15 hours and transplanted those three hearts and nana i felt okay i felt okay and in the morning he said hi i'm dr chung i said nice to see you he said this is dr kang from singapore he's going to be assisting me and watching while i do the surgery i said well great i prayed for you all both of you and by name dr chung i prayed for you dr kang i prayed for you and they said well thank you they accepted that but i i wanted to get that in and i had prayed for them and a man who was a cardiologist was not even there but he was looking at the pictures and he said well he said we have 14 blockages and we've bypassed those and the dr chung was able to bypass them with about three only three bypasses it was just miraculous and uh so i was standing there and he said he said you have this bypass and that bypass and you have a uh an extra one he says and my wife said to him why do we have that he said it's because he's a man of god and he's jewish he was jewish cardiologist but he said well he's a man of god and so they operated on it and he he wouldn't let michael in the room michael wanted so badly to go in michael is our in-house doctor but he this was above him apparently anyhow michael that was the other part of the story and that's why they wouldn't let because i had said to my wife nobody goes in and sees until the tube is out of i don't i don't want them to see in tube and that was because my grand my son-in-law who's married to linda ordeal and kenneth ordeal was there and i said i do not want them to see them moving that two boat two weeks before he had saw he had had to give the word for his mother to have the tube taken out and she didn't last and they had a funeral for her and i said i don't want that right i i don't want that to happen i want to him to know that it's all done and it's finished and the man who was doing it he said can you hear me yes i said i can hear you he said the last little thing i'm going to do is take the tube out and i took it out i wasn't in tube anymore and i was perfectly fine and i've been perfectly fine ever since praise god spencer thank you
