Who's ever been to a meal, been with a meal with someone and seen them put uh pepper and salt all over their meal? Just liberally, just all over. Who's ever seen that before? And it's like they're drowning it in salt and pepper. I feel our services ought to just be filled with praises and thanksgivings when we hear the word. It ought to just not be sporadic here. Amen. Praise you, Jesus. It ought to just be full. That's the house of the Lord. We ought to just be filling it up. Thank you, Jesus. Glory to God. Enter into his gates with thanksgiving, courts with praise. Heavenly Father, we want to enter into your gates, Lord, with hands lifted up, our hearts wide open, our mouths expressing our love to you. Lord, we love you today, Lord. You've been so generous. Lord, you've opened up heaven to us. You've given us healing. You've given us salvation. You've given us deliverance. You've given us promises of a future home of a millennium. There's no reason for doubt. There's no room for fear. There's no room for Satan this morning. In fact, even now, we claim deliverance and we claim healing and your power to be poured into this service, Lord. Let the appearing of your word and the appearing of your presence be strong today, Lord. And let the bride of Christ respond, Lord, from our lives, not in coolness or starchiness, but may it just be wide open, Lord, of receiving. Thus, sayeth the Lord. We've been instructed to rally around the gift of God, the Holy Spirit, the presence of God. So, we want to be faithful today, Lord, to rally around the opening of your presence. And may the Holy Spirit be poured out into this meeting, God. coming against every unbelief, every doubt, and everything of Satan's kingdom, announcing to him that he is defeated, that we are on the winning side. Satan's already lost the battle. The struggle is over. The battle is over. It is finished, Lord. And we are receiving the benefits of your power, God. Oh, let the word today be strong among us. Let the power of God be released Lord into every life, every situation, God. May every believer, Lord, be responding to the word of God that this is our day of jubilee. This is the year of jubilee. Oh God, may your Holy Spirit, Lord, be so felt within our bodies, Lord, that sicknesses would leave, cancers would leave, tumors would fall off, illnesses, Lord, would would be would be delivered out of the people's lives. Spirits would be mended, Lord. Hearts would be brought back into fellowship that there would be such a love, such a pouring out of your presence, Lord. It'd be joy unspeakable, Lord. there be a spontaneous praise, God. And may our souls be fed on the word of God. Strengthen our pastor today, Lord. We believe in these closing moments of time, Lord, that we want to be tuned into that other dimension. We want the spirit of God, Lord, to come so near to us and that we would recognize your presence. Bless today, God. We give it to you, Lord. Be with our sister Jenny Gray. Lord, bless her, Lord. And may her body be healed and delivered of this condition. And may the faith that she has in you, Lord, as her physician just guide the surgeons, Lord, and as we all of us would desire healing and to to give our lives to you for service, then that we would be free of any inhibitions or thing of Satan's kingdom. Would you grant grace and mercy to Sister Jenny and to many unspoken requests? Hands are all throughout the building and on the internet. Lord Jesus, you are everything to us. We invite your nearness today. Everything that you're going to say to us, we agree with it already and we say amen, Lord. We we are so happy to be on the winning side, Lord, and to know that we can get behind what you're doing, Lord, and rally around, Lord, the spoken word of God, and that the atmosphere can be created, the environment can be right, Lord Jesus. We just love you, Lord. Come down among us and bless Brother Ryan and all the musicians, our brother Tim Dodd tonight, Lord. May this whole day just be filled with your glory, Lord, and the glory of the Lord filling the house. Bless your name, Jesus. We're under expectation for what you're going to do and what you're doing among us. Bless Brother Tom, Lord, there and brother Dutch Scott, Lord, in the meetings as he comes back home. May his heart be full, Lord, to be able to give back to us, Lord, what you've dealt with his life. We just love your gifts, Lord. All of them, Lord. be thankful for every service and every moment, Lord. Every musician, every giver and the sound and the video, the Sunday school teachers, Lord, we're all together, Lord, to see the move of God among us. Oh, Father, we love you. Take the service in Jesus name. Amen. [Music] Amen. God bless you. You may have your seats. Want to welcome everyone in the name of our Lord Jesus. We're happy to have each and everyone with us here this morning. Amen. He's already provided Sister Elena. I'm going to ask our brother Nathan Hilderbrand if he'd come ready to sing for us. Want to welcome those on the internet telephone hookup to say God bless you. We're glad you can be a part of the service this morning. Amen. There's a great unseen host out there and they're part of our family. Amen. I just hear so many wonderful things. And then you travel and you walk into someone's house and they're playing songs that we sing here and that the choir sung and it goes out all over the world and it's a it's a blessing to those. And so I just want to say God bless you and all those who put in effort and those who sing. It's an incredible blessing and we want to say God bless you for it. Brother Nathan, why don't you come as we sing? He's already provided everything you need. Oh, he's already provided. Yes, he's already provided. Oh, everything you need. Oh, he's already provided. Every promise you can make. Every proise you can make. Just ask it in his name. every day. Oh, he's our proider. Oh, he's already Yes, he's already providing. [Music] Bless everything you need. He's already Oh, and every promise you can make. Just ask it in his name. everything you see. For I know from [Music] &gt;&gt; Good morning. &gt;&gt; God bless you. It's good to be here. Amen. The &gt;&gt; song I want to sing is called He's Standing By. I hear a song though the night is silent. I see a star though dark clouds hide the sky. [Music] I feel a touch. Although my friends have left me, I'm not alone, I know he's standing by. He's standing by. I feel his presence with me. Like Moses when he climb Mount Sunny, he's standing by. He knows how much I need him. He loves me so I know he's standing by. I went away into a far off country. In pain and wants, he heard my lonely cry. He brought me back. He put a new robe on me. It cost his life. I know he's standing by. He's standing by. I feel his presence with me. Like Moses when he climbed Mount Si. [Music] He's standing by. He knows how much I need him. He loves me so I know he's standing by. Now I can sing a song of full redemption. He dwells within his lovely little bride. The bleeding word transforms her to his image. Till she is him. Oh, I know he's standing by. He's standing by. I feel his presence with me. Like Moses when he find Mount Si, [Music] he's standing by. He knows how much I need him. He loves me so I know he's standing by. Can we sing it together? Oh, he's standing by. I feel his presence with me like Moses when he climbed Mount A. He's standing by. He knows how much I need him. He loves me so I know he's standing by. [Applause] Amen. As the children come in from Sunday school and the deacons make ready, we're going to take up an offering at this time. Amen. &gt;&gt; It's good to come into the house of Lord of the Lord and worship him. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And giving is a part of that worship. And we want to lift an offering to him this morning as a sacrifice. &gt;&gt; Amen. Worship is always a sacrifice. You know, Brother Brandham said, this almost sounds like I'm pulling for money here. Just a second. But worship in general is a sacrifice. &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham says if it if it feels easy, then there there's no spiritual sacrifice in it. &gt;&gt; Sometimes it doesn't we don't feel like raising our hands. &gt;&gt; Amen. But we raise them anyway &gt;&gt; as a sacrifice unto the Lord. &gt;&gt; Sometimes we don't feel like taking up an offering. And it's not just you folks that don't feel like giving. Sometimes sometimes we as ministry, we don't we don't feel like well, you know, we've taken up lots of offerings and maybe the people will won't like it if we take up another offering, but it's a sacrifice &gt;&gt; and we want to give as unto the Lord. Amen. Let's just bow our heads in a word of prayer. Heavenly Father, &gt;&gt; Lord, sometimes we don't always know where the right words come from &gt;&gt; when we speak something that is necessary for the benefit of the hearer. And &gt;&gt; Lord, we're in such anticipation this morning of the word. &gt;&gt; But Lord, there's a part of worship that comes in giving, Lord. And I'm reminded, Lord, of your prophet that said many times he had a meetings and he and there was the odd time that he would try and get by of the meeting without taking up an offering and it just wasn't the successful that it ought to have been. And Lord, we just know that it was because we have a part to give. We have something to play in the service, oh God. And our giving is a part of that worship. And so now, Lord, as we come to give, we pray that you'll accept it as a sacrifice in your presence, Lord, we lift it not to a church or to a a deacon. We lift it unto the living God. &gt;&gt; And we ask, Lord, that you'll receive it and that you'll bless it to the kingdom of God. And may all our small part, though it be just two might, may you increase it to the purpose that you have predestinated it for. We commit the offering to you asking your blessing upon it in Jesus Christ's name. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Here I am to worship. Amen. Just as the offering's being taken up, we're going to prepare our hearts for the word. Brother Bisco is going to be coming and speaking for us. Just want our hearts to be ready. Amen. Light of the world. Oh light of the world, you step down into darkness. Oh, open my eyes. Let me see. Oh, such beauty that made this heart. The joy of the life spent with you. Oh, here I am to worship, Lord. Here I am to bow out. Here I am to say that you're my God. Lord, you're all together lovey. You're all together worthy, allto together wonderful to me. King of all things. Oh, the king of all. Oh, so highly exalted. Your glorious in heaven above. So humbly you came to the earth that you created and all of sin. We came for here I am to worship. Lord here I am to bow down. Here I am to say that you're my God. [Music] All together love more. [Music] Oh, wonderful to thee. I'll never know. Oh, and I'll never know just how much it costs for to see my sin upon that cross. And I'll never know how much it cost to see my sin upon that cross. Oh my. Oh, here I am first. [Music] Oh, it's my to say that you're my God. [Music] Oh yes, you love me Lord and you are worthy. Oh wonderful to me. Here I am and to worship. Here I am to bow hell. Here I am to say that you're my God. [Music] For you are lovely. Oh you are worthy. Wonderful. [Music] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Have you come here to worship him this morning? Hallelujah. To bring the sacrifice of praise. He's worthy, saints, of everything we have to offer. As our brother John said, it should just be an outpouring of thanksgiving, of worship, and of praise. He's worthy of more than just a a nodding of the head or raising of the hands. We've been given voices and lifts to praise and with. If we don't, the rocks will cry out. Oh, we want there just to be an anthem of thanksgiving from the redeemed this morning, saying that here we are to worship, Lord. Here we are to give you thanks, Father, for what you've done for us. For you are worthy, Lord. Blessed be your name, Lord Jesus. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. We want there to be such an atmosphere that when the word comes, it would just come forth with power and with deliverance, that there would be healing in our midst. Hallelujah. Why don't we invite our pastor to come and as he comes sing blessed be blessed be your name. Hallelujah. Oh blessed be. Oh blessed be we sing. Blessed be the name. Oh blessed. Oh God, bless me. Oh, bless you. We sing the second verse. Oh Lord our soul. You're the mountain more than my heart always thirsts for. The Lord makes me whole. You're the love of my soul. And whatever comes my way. I know you're in control. I say blessed me. Oh Lord, blessed me. Blessed me for the blessing. Oh Lord, blessed me. Oh, bless. Hallelujah. Let your people proclaim and let your people proclaim. [Music] You are holy. Oh, we sing you our holy God. We lift up your name and give him glory. Hallelujah. Sing that again. Let your people and let your people [Music] That is our [Music] God and we [Applause] [Music] glory. You see everything [Music] that you are holy [Music] and glory [Music] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Blessed be the name of Jesus. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Lord, we cry out you are holy this morning. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Blessed be your name. [Music] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. a wonderful atmosphere. [Music] &gt;&gt; Amen. Wonder if we could all stand. We I want to go to the word immediately, but just before we turn to the word, I'd like to just say with regards to brother Tim's comments on the on the offerings, you notice we're we are taking up offerings in the Sunday morning services and some other services. And and this does not replace the the uh offering box. And those of you that have been here for years and you're accustomed to your tithes, tithes are for the ministry of the word. And we send out tithes. Sometimes send out uh hub stations because it's the word. Sometimes tithes pays for the special ministry that comes, the ministry that is here, anything to do with the word. And then uh offerings is to the provide for the utilities and the upkeep of the church. And missions of course is strictly the missions and many much of the offerings go to missions as well. But the reason we started taking up offerings is there we have guests that come and a lot of visitors come and that's number one. Number two, we have a lot of young people that have gone up from 12 to 17, from 15 to 20. And in that time they've have gone into the workforce or they started working whatever more. And I think that it gives them an opportunity to become uh initiated and to know that this is a part of Christian living. And quite frankly, you're looking at a person right now. I think giving is a wonderful thing. I love giving not only in the church but to people or to help out in whatever way. And and I think uh you know it has been said whatever comes into your hands hold it loosely cuz the Lord may want it and and if you happen to get uh one or two uh items count to give one away. That's a that's a good spirit. Hallelujah. And I thought we would start even a website maybe called uh lof living for others. Living for others.com. How would that be? Hallelujah. The bride of Jesus Christ. Amen. We've got a glorious gospel. So, I thought I would just make that comment. I don't want to take up any other time because I need it for the word this morning. Are you ready for the word? &gt;&gt; Amen. I'm looking down seeing brother Kyle Morton uh brother Kyle has uh has written and we've had under discussion the the prayer meeting. So the prayer meetings which have been just suspended for a short time uh they're not they're not cancelled at all. We're just rearranging things and discussing some things and and because uh I I think a a successful church is a praying church and we have lots to pray about and I'm so thankful for those of you that feel a burden to pray and I just ask that that the spirit of prayer will come upon this congregation. Amen. Hallelujah. And we know we don't only pray here in church. Of course not. But it's wonderful to get together at the hour of prayer. Amen. We'll turn in the Bible please to uh scripture reading which we started with last week. Ephesians the 6th chapter. And I'm going to be taking from a different direction but the same subject, the spirit world. And uh you might as well prepare to say amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I Lord willing I just uh this been on my mind so long and I see it from so many directions and I just couldn't get stopped last night and so I tried to stop about 8:00 and getting close to 11 or still I just couldn't. And I said, 'Lord, I you have to give me the strength and the energy cuz I just feel like preaching right now. That's something. Amen. Isn't he wonderful? &gt;&gt; Let's just bow our heads in a moment of prayer. Oh father, our father, which art in heaven, glorified and hallowed be your name. And we do say again this morning, let your kingdom come and may your will be done in every life and every home and every family. Lord, we pray that you'll provide and break the bread to us today and give us our daily food. May we be strengthened thereby. I pray, oh God, that you'll forgive us our sins, our wrongs, anything that we have has come between you and I or grieved us, you grieved you. We pray, Father, in the name of Jesus Christ, you'll forgive us as we forgive others. We pray that you'll bless this congregation and those that are streaming at this time. And we thank you for answered prayers. And now we pray you'll anoint your word mightily, anoint the people and the speaker in the name of Jesus Christ and for his glory alone. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Last week, we were asked to pray, I believe it was last week, the week before for Sister Angela Michel's brother and sent me an email this morning that God had answered that prayer. And uh now we're just praying that his soul will be touched and moved towards God. Amen. All right, we're going to begin reading in the 10th verse. Finally, my brethren, be strong in the Lord and in the power of his might. Put on the whole armor of God that you may be able to stand against the ws of the devil. Now, notice we're standing against, in this case, the ws of the devil or the methods of the devil, &gt;&gt; his program, &gt;&gt; his strategies, &gt;&gt; and there's no end of them. But but this is different from trials and tribulations and whatever more. So we in this case we stand against them. For we wrestle not against flesh and blood, but against principalities and powers, against the rulers of the darkness of this world, against spiritual wickedness in high places. Wherefore take unto you the whole armor of God, that you may be able to uh to withstand in the evil day, and having done all to stand. Stand therefore, having your loins gird about with truth, and having on the breastplate of righteousness, and your feet shaw with the preparation of the gospel of peace, above all, taking the shield of faith, wherewith you shall be able to quench all the fiery darts of the wicked, and take the helmet of salvation, and the sword of the spirit, which is the word of God. I have a second reading in 2 Corinthians chapter 4 16 and 17. And then we will go to 1 Peter 1:es 5-7. 2 Corinthians 4:16-1 17. For which cause we faint not, but though our outward man perish, yet the inward man is renewed day by day. For our light affliction, notice that, which is but for a moment, workketh for us far more a far more exceeding and eternal weight of glory. &gt;&gt; Amen. And then in first Peter 1 starting verse 5, we are kept by the power of God through faith unto salvation, ready to be revealed in the last time, wherein you greatly rejoice, though now for a season if need be, you are in heaviness through manifold temptations, that the trial of your faith being much more precious than than of gold that perisheth though it be tried with fire might be found under praise and honor and glory at the appearing of Jesus Christ. Amen. &gt;&gt; You may be seated. And I would like to ask that there be just as little movement as possible in the congregation and the young people and their children. Uh this is not just a sermon this morning. This is something that's really been uh very uh very real to me and I like I remembered what brother Brandham said when he was coming in the seals. He said he just wished that he would be able to convey it and make it real the way it comes to him. And so that's what I think every minister goes through. And I'm praying especially and and you've been so attentive and I really really appreciate that. I want to get right into it and I'd like to give you just an overview to begin with so you know where we're going. And there isn't anybody in the audience, the streaming audience or this audience that I wouldn't be speaking to even from the younger youngest to the eldest of us. But I would like to speak on how God uses the forces of circumstance. I want you to think about this now. The forces of circumstance often, you know, circumstances take on a life of their own. Things happen, things take place, things come into our lives, into our homes, into our into our environment uh uninvited. And some of them we wish we could show the exit door to but somehow they remained there and uh some things sometimes we had high expectations for something but it turned sour and uh things go sideways uh unplanned unpredicted uh but nevertheless I want you to lift your eyes above that because I'm speaking last week and this week on the spirit spirit world. Uh the spirit world is something we are not nearly as conscious of as we should be. Uh sometime you're talking to someone or there's just so many examples and sometime we may not even know ourselves but we're being influenced by the spirit world and I trust we're being spirit influenced by the um spirits of angels which are to be ministering to us. The Bible says they're ministering spirits. &gt;&gt; Do you believe that &gt;&gt; present here? God will never never leave his people outside of the influence of the Holy Spirit and the spirit of God. So we we understand that. So the forces of circumstance and he uses these to form or to move things forward according to his plan or the full plan of redemption. Now you'll really see in a in a few moments. This is a glorious truth. The travail of birth painans will be very much part of this subject. The distress and the pressures of spiritual trials. The squeeze. And we are familiar with that term, the squeeze. I think you'll have a different view of the squeeze by the time we're done the service. uh the squeeze and the result of the squeeze the squeeze when the first atom was formed because that's what the word formed goes into and actually means in Hebrew the squeeze when the first atom was formed the squeeze that the life of Jesus Christ details his life was a life acquainted with grief and sorrow, the distress and the pressures of spiritual trials and the squeeze and the result of the squeeze and our experience today. What we experience in the masterpiece, I've not started the subject yet. I'm just laying a little bit of a prefoundation here. And in these weakening conditions, notice it's a masterpiece. and in these weakening conditions and afflictions and things of the world that's put upon us sometime to perfect us. &gt;&gt; He said, "Think it not strange that these trials come? They're only working out for our good and to perfect us and bring us into that place." Now, we may consider that place as a spiritual attainment here, but I want to carry it further because what we're really here for is for an eternal purpose. And I want to refer to that place as the place where Jesus said, "I go to prepare a place for you." And I want to tie together the things that we're experiencing which we think are just daytoday struggles. We need to like the boy on the bicycle. Look at the end. &gt;&gt; You'll never be able to handle or conduct ourselves the way we ought to with the present situations &gt;&gt; because we feel swallowed up. We may feel overwhelmed. But if you look at the end, &gt;&gt; then you'll be able to understand the present. And so he said, "Think it not strange concerning the trials that come. They're only working for our good and to perfect us and to bring us into that place." These great and I love this phrase. I would like to have had it on the screen for you, but if you would remember, this is one of the This is a piece of literature. these great deserts of experience where righteous men are molded into saints. We thank thee for these experiences where righteous men are molded into saints. These experiences, these deserts of experience, deserts are not oases. Deserts are not mountaintops. Deserts are not some glorious scenery. Deserts are where people die and die for thirst and burn their feet and searing deserts. These experiences because the prophet also knew where it'll take us. The squeeze and the pressure of distress on the message. I want to speak of that as well. So from Adam, the first Adam, Jesus, the second Adam, even the prophets of God, the Bible speaks of them and the pressure that is on us as individuals and the squeeze on the message. Let me say it at at this point also, if you are a believer and you are the word, you cannot expect that the message would be squeezed and you're not. You could not expect that the message will be disdained and hated and you're not. &gt;&gt; Jesus said they hated me, they'll hate you. &gt;&gt; Why? Because you're a believer and a follower of me. &gt;&gt; We can't expect that we're going to just go along and, you know, life's going to be great and all the rest of it. This has nothing to do about conditions. You know, things may be difficult economically. They may be great economic. That doesn't change the pressure that a person may feel and the forces. Remember the forces of this world and the prince and the power of the air is not for us. He's against us, &gt;&gt; against the word of God and is going to do everything he can to have you doubt and believe God's promises or believe that what's happening to you is actually for your benefit. &gt;&gt; Glad you all agree. The Bible in these scriptures of which we read speaks of the ws of the devil and our light affliction and the trial of our faith in the three scriptures which we read. And we cannot equate the two, the ws of the devil with the trials and persecutions or the trials uh of our faith. Because the Bible, the Bible does not say the ws of the devil are more precious than gold. The Bible says that the trial of your faith is more precious than gold. more precious than gold that perisheth. &gt;&gt; I need you, this is a class this morning, but I need you to really hang on to that. Remember, gold that perisheth. The trial of your faith is much more precious than that of gold which perisheth. The trial, I'm getting ahead of myself, but the trial that you experience is like the gold that perisheth. &gt;&gt; The trial will disappear. &gt;&gt; But what God is working in you will remain. &gt;&gt; What God is working in you is going to carry you further forward in the plan of God. &gt;&gt; Amen. and eventually birth you into a new world. &gt;&gt; Brother Brown says if you want to know something, he said we'll have to go back to the beginning. So I just go back to the beginning for a moment. God is a spirit. &gt;&gt; And as we spoke, this will tie into last week just a wee bit. And the first man, I'm abbreviating it and making it a short and going over it quickly, so you'll have to hang on. The first man was a spirit man. And then God brought that man down and placed the spirit man into the flesh. And the Lord God formed man of the dust of the ground and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life. And man became a living soul. And God knew that from that flesh man he would take and separate the feminine part &gt;&gt; and that the fall would come as a result of them being formed into flesh. And so now, but he didn't take the spirit man out. &gt;&gt; So now we have a spirit man in a flesh man that is not capable of fulfilling everything, all the attributes and all the character and all the desire. Now you'll understand it right away when you you there isn't a person here but what has been at a time when they you know you've gone to a funeral and and a loved one is laying here in the casket and you are meeting the family what are you going to say uh I'm so sorry your your spirit inside you can feel volumes you want to express volumes you come here into the house God said, you know, if I could just somehow release what's inside, if I could really say what's on the inside &gt;&gt; in our family relations and and and our uh association with one another, we say, "Well, well, God bless you." But you'd like to There's volumes that I'd like to say. What is it? It's it's a spirit of God that is within us that can express so much more than the tongue can say, than the mind can think. And this body is a confinement. We're we're imprisoned. &gt;&gt; And so the Bible says that God formed man. And the and the word formed is yatsar which is through the squeezing into shape and furthermore to be formed or fashioned or created in a frame to bind to be distressed or in distress I'm not talking about your trials now I'm talking about this frame to be to be cramped to make narrow or to be squeezed. And brother Brandham said in God's power to transform, but God is a spirit and the first man that he created was spirit man and he was in the image and in the likeness of God and then he put this man in flesh and man fell. So then God came down and became in the image of man that he might redeem that fallen man. Now you may have heard all of this long before I gave the same quote may feel as though oh but I'm going to ask you don't project it like well yeah I've heard all that I know exactly where you're going cuz I don't think you perhaps do know exactly where we're going this morning. So then God came down and become in the image of man that he might redeem the fallen man or the fallen flesh. That's the real gospel story to my opinion. When man fell, the spirit man became imprisoned. Now here I'm starting. When man fell, the spirit man became imprisoned, confined, trapped in a body of flesh. In this fallen state, he was not permitted to eat of the tree of life. All his qualities, his attributes, his authority, his power diminished. The spirit was still there. But all of these things that all these qualities and attributes of the spirit, that's why you feel what you feel. Say, "Oh God, if I could just oh for a thousand tongues &gt;&gt; to give my father's praise." Listen friends, this is my message this morning when I come to an end, if I can come to an end, is that is where we're headed. you are headed. In fact, I want to tie together the very ministry we refer to as the message and the messenger and the prophet of this age and that there was no ministry like it is for this exclusive purpose to give you a hint of where you're going. &gt;&gt; When you had a messenger, your messenger, your prophet say I'm in two worlds. Scientists might call it another dimension. Can if you could only see what I'm looking at. I'm looking at uh I'm I'm looking at him. &gt;&gt; Jesus Christ of Nazareth is right here. And I say to you that same one is right here because you are sitting here as evidence that I'm a believer of this message. And he came exclusively for the elect, for the believers of this message, so that they would have an indication of where they're headed. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And he would tell us at the same time the things that we suffer, the things that we endure, and you are simply experiencing the testing of the word. And he said, when the testing of this word is over, I'll read it for you later. When the testing of this word is over, then we go to that other body. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And that other body is being formed right now while you're believing his word. &gt;&gt; It's a word body. I don't understand this body. Neither do you. &gt;&gt; We don't understand the mystery of its forming. &gt;&gt; We don't understand the mystery of its coming together. Oh, we have pictures and all of these things, but ah, we don't understand it. We don't understand all the supernatural things that take place when a mother gives birth. And in the travail and in the constraint and in the restriction of birth, that child is coming from a place where it can't see anything and doesn't really breathe and it's coming into a whole new world &gt;&gt; where it sees colors and smells flowers and sees sights and and can begin to express something. That's just this flesh. &gt;&gt; What about What about when this is released? &gt;&gt; That's why you're experiencing what you're experiencing. It's not a downer, it's an upper. &gt;&gt; So in his fallen state, he was not permitted to eat of the tree of life. Prophet said he lost his original condition and brought the whole world subject to death. And in the bridge it says when he lost his life he also lost his inheritance in his life. See a person can lose their life but they may not have an inheritance. But Adam had an had an inheritance and he lost his inheritance when he lost his life also. In the angel of God message, he said he was the first one who had the jurisdiction over everything. He was the first one that had the jurisdiction over everything in the earth and he lost his power. &gt;&gt; Now we can talk about what he lost. But now we have a a messenger who looked into two worlds, who was in two worlds, who was in another dimension, tells us about that dimension, tells us that every believer is going there. Do you believe that? I need to ask you. &gt;&gt; And this messenger said, everything Adam lost has been brought back. We may not be able to exercise everything. This body may hold us back from it. Our minds can't comprehend it. That doesn't change the word. The word says everything he lost has been given back has been purchased back by Jesus Christ. And I want to stand here publicly and say I believe that. &gt;&gt; And thus it is our light affliction. &gt;&gt; Our light affliction. Why? Because that is the gold that perisheth. &gt;&gt; The light affliction. The Bible says our light affliction which is but for a moment workketh for us. &gt;&gt; Your light affliction which you want to get rid of is working for you. Your light affliction is an employer employee. &gt;&gt; It's doing something for you. &gt;&gt; You say, "Well, I don't really care for it." Well, I uh I went to school for a few years and I didn't I wasn't really in love with everything I had to do and all the restrictions and all the things of school and you know and a lot of kids why are they so happy when holidays come there's no school there's no confinement I'm imprisoned in this classroom at least we feel that way but when we're get out we finally say I got a diploma But what we went through to get it, &gt;&gt; you know. All right. Can I keep going? He said that man was made as a secondary God on the earth. He was given the power to control things. All elements of the earth that was Adam. Now, I I I was sitting on on my horse on one of the hunts with brother Brandham. And now some people may not understand that. I'm not going to try to make you understand it. There are many today that are waiting for brother Brandham to come and because he said they they said that there's a vision of a large bear which he didn't get and no vision can fail. I saw that bear and that's perfectly fine if he comes back and gets it because I will be there for sure and God's gonna have to do something in that bear to make it young again. But anyway, we came into a storm right the day after I saw this bear. Came into the storm. One day we sit in our tent. Two days we sit in our tent. Three days we sit in our tent. Four days rain, rain, storm, just socked in. And we decide to leave. The horses are wet. All the tent is wet and heavy. And you that hunt and camp, you know what this is all about. It's just plain ugly. And the horses are miserable. And we're miserable. And brother Bud was packing them up, and he's miserable. And it's just nasty. Uh and and Brother Bam came out and he said, "Brother Bud, how long will we be?" Oh, he said, "Uh, oh, we got you got lots of time." He said, "We're going to be a while here, a couple hours or more." He came over to me. He says, "Brother Eddie," he said, "Uh, this is on account of me." Said, "I knew better. I was supposed to be with those little fellows." and he and brother Bud went one direction and Billy Paul, brother Blaine and myself went another direction and brother Bud sent us that way and uh he said this is on account of me and I won't say everything he said but he said u he said where'd you see that bear so I told him exactly and he he left and he come back a while later and uh I was I was sitting there and he said he walked up to Let me put his finger up like this. Now, you have to understand, you people in Vancouver, in the Northwest, you understand what it is when a socked in. I mean, there it's not clouds. It's just socked in. And this man comes up, Brother Brandham comes up and he says, "This is over and we'll ride out of here dry. &gt;&gt; Dry. We're We are in a rainclose and just uh the distance from here even to the doors is where the bush and the willows thick willows are. And you're not going to go through those willows even for 3 minutes without be soaking to your hide unless you got rain clothes on. Is this drenched? And I'm still sitting there about 15 20 minutes later. Her blood is still packing the horses and it just exactly it just by in front of me a warm wind. I thought where'd that come from? And I just kind of look, you know, that was so warm. And then uh uh and a little while later, you know, this blew a wee bit and there was warm wind. I thought, my that's nice. And uh it wasn't it wasn't 10 or 15 minutes and a big hole appeared in the sky and the sun sun was shining straight through and I just looked up like that looked straight through the blue sky and before before our horse my horse took a step. The sky was totally blue and we rode out in shirt sleeves dry and warm. Now I tell you what friends, if that hadn't happened, I wouldn't be here preaching. &gt;&gt; When a person says, "We'll ride out dry and I had w dried out. I had rode out soaked to the hide," it'd be a different kind of a preaching. &gt;&gt; That's why I can say, "Thus sayaith the Lord, &gt;&gt; I saw and you believe it." And you have to believe what the word of God says that his righteousness, he has taken all of our sins. He's replaced it with all of his righteousness. He said, "I go to prepare a place for you." And what we're experiencing here is simply molding us and shaping us for that place. &gt;&gt; And we had demonstrated here that same power. Adam had power over the elements. And now we have a message and a messenger demonstrated and a few witnesses that can still declare we saw the weather change. &gt;&gt; We don't just have to hear about something in Colorado. We had it right in British Columbia. We've had it in the United States. We've had it in Canada. And I don't say that's the only time it's ever happened. Maybe happened for you and a special moment. But I want to say to this congregation, if you could only see beyond this little veil of flesh for a few moments, it would change your life forever. &gt;&gt; Listen to this. Brother Brandham says things that I don't think we'll live long enough to really fully understand. And this is one of the statements and I start to read just where I was. Man was made as a secondary God on earth. He was given the power to control all things, all elements of the earth. That was Adam. Adam was given, now listen to this, Adam was given these great powers. But then the power that he was given to make himself is where he fell. He couldn't bring forth himself in his original condition. He could bring forth an able, but he couldn't bring forth himself in his original condition. He lost his power to bring forth himself. &gt;&gt; You're wondering God who gave him that power. God brought forth himself in Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; It wasn't a sexual birth. &gt;&gt; He brought forth himself. &gt;&gt; Adam lost the power to bring forth himself. &gt;&gt; He could not bring forth another Adam in his original condition. &gt;&gt; Now it was a the whole enterprise was fallen. Are you with me? &gt;&gt; And so God stay now close. So God took the same elements of which he made Adam's body and brought forth himself &gt;&gt; so that he could take those elements through to the curse &gt;&gt; which was death &gt;&gt; and go through death and bring back and they went to the tomb to see the body and it wasn't there because he had changed those elements &gt;&gt; and brought them forth into another body which could never suffer, could never go to the cross, would never have to pay for sin again. That's where you are going. [Music] &gt;&gt; Think about it. &gt;&gt; That's the program. &gt;&gt; And he came in the body of the elements of this flesh. Jesus had a body like you had a body. But he suffered. &gt;&gt; He was betrayed. &gt;&gt; He was accused. He went through all sort of things. He gained friends. He lost friends. &gt;&gt; As brother Brandham said in what I believe was his squeeze in the seventh seal, this will cause 10,000 &gt;&gt; of my friends to leave me. &gt;&gt; That's a squeeze, friends. if you lose a friend or two friends, but when you lose a entire association of of entire churches and support of thousands of people, I'm not talking about financial support. I'm talking about the support of people who who believe in you and love you and follow the message and follow you and then begin to say, "Ah, he went off and and he's gone into false doctrine and he never should have been teaching. He should have just stayed with the gift and all kinds of things." and 10,000 friends leave, don't tell me it's not a squeeze. And if you believe the same message that he spoke, you will experience the same squeeze. &gt;&gt; And if you think that we're going to go through this and just enter into some happy uh land uh you know, heavenly place with no obstacles, you're mistaken. &gt;&gt; But they are for your benefit. They are precious trials. &gt;&gt; It says now that was in the beginning of man. That's what God gave him power over everything on the earth. Now though he fell, though he fell, he lost that power. Then when he lost the power then he became becomes unconscious to the fact unconscious to the fact after losing his relationship and friendship and fellowship with the father he becomes unconscious. Then he lost that and all of his great channels became clogged up and he couldn't get through. God sends a message to unclog those channels &gt;&gt; so that you can get through &gt;&gt; and bring us to be conscious again. &gt;&gt; We were unconscious &gt;&gt; to what God had done for us. But I thank God for this message that has brought a consciousness back and we're coming alive and we're able to say, "Praise God and worship him in spirit and in truth &gt;&gt; because we're conscious again." &gt;&gt; It's a little girl. She was shot in the head uh because she wanted to go to school uh and the Islam extremist shot her in the head and she just coming to and her father was sitting beside her and they were just so ecstatic because she's trying now to speak. I'll tell you what, God, &gt;&gt; his heart is filled with joy because now he's sent his prophet word back to the people. And there's a people who have regained consciousness again and begin to know what kind of worship is acceptable to God. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. I'm calling and speaking to our people who have become conscious again. You've been unconscious of what God's program was. And now maybe you can say it. And if you can't, you need to hang in there until you can say, "I see it. I see it. I'm getting my vision back. I'm getting my speech back. Glory to God. I'm getting my understanding back. My brain that was dead has become alive again." &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; Don't forget this. Don't forget this message. &gt;&gt; This is taking you from Genesis to Revelation. &gt;&gt; This is the program of God. &gt;&gt; God went back. He says what Godam was in God, what Adam was in God, Christ has redeemed us back to that. I would like you to hear that and not take me as a reader of that quote. But if you believe that quote, I'd like to hear you acknowledge it. &gt;&gt; What Adam was in God, Christ has redeemed back has redeemed us back to that. [Music] Now a redeemer to redeem anything is to bring it back to its origin again. &gt;&gt; That is why the apostle Paul says these are precious these are precious trials more precious than gold which perisheth. &gt;&gt; This body will perish. &gt;&gt; The gold will perish. &gt;&gt; But that which it is accomplishing will live forever. So God went back before the beginning with the spoken word prophesied. Number one, he prophesied of redemption through Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; Number two, he created the spoken word of his promise, a seed in the womb of Mary. &gt;&gt; And see, that seed only came to the womb of Mary because it was already a spoken word by the prophets. a virgin shall conceive as part of the program. Number three, he came forth in a body of flesh just like we did. So up till now, he is exactly like us. He's come in a body of flesh like we did. Even though he came from a virgin birth, virgin seed, seed from God, he was born like we are born. He got tired like you get tired. &gt;&gt; He wept like you weep. &gt;&gt; He got weary. &gt;&gt; He experienced all the feelings that we experience. &gt;&gt; He was tempted in all points like you are. &gt;&gt; Can you believe that? &gt;&gt; People get Jesus on a pedestal, but he wasn't like you. He was like you. And that was important. And he came forth in a body of flesh like we did. He took that body to the death of the cross like we it's appointed unto man once to die. I say it to the boys. I say it to the girls. I say it to the young couples. I say it to the aged. Unless we would have a change in the body. We are all appointed unto death. It's appointed un man once to die and after this the judgment. But Jesus did something else after death. He came back &gt;&gt; in another body. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And if you are living your life and being educated and working for a living and going through this life without that as your objective, you're wasting your time. [Music] &gt;&gt; Go eat, drink, and be married for tomorrow we die. &gt;&gt; If everybody's going to die and go down into a six-foot hole, what's the difference whether it's sooner or later? Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; But he took that that body that body &gt;&gt; to the death of the cross &gt;&gt; and he rose victorious &gt;&gt; with a body that did walk. &gt;&gt; A body that did talk. &gt;&gt; A body that did listen and carried on a conversation. And a body that ate. And a body that could be handled. but a body that could vanish. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And a body that could ascend into the heavens. &gt;&gt; Do you believe that he had that kind of body? &gt;&gt; Have a look at your body. &gt;&gt; It's not very great. You can pretty it up and whatever more. I I uh Brother Brandham talks about he was in a museum and he saw the the a bunch of young people looking at the at a figure of a man or something 150 pounds and great strong young man. And it said on there he was worth 84 cents. And that was based on 3.71% inflation. And I took and worked that back to 62 years. That was a lengthy time of work for me. And I figured he's worth seven and 3/4 cents today. Hello, young man full of muscles and all. I say 7 and 12 cents of it. 7 and 3/4 cents. You young ladies, I hope you're not 150 pounds or you might be that. It might be more. You just have more to have. Beautiful, that's all. But you're worth 7 and 3/4 cents. And found some calculations said maybe even up to 12 cents. Isn't that great? Maybe that's some country didn't have as much inflation. And so you put a nice hat on or a suit on or nice scarf and get all fixed up. And don't forget, you're walking into this church with about seven and 3/4 cents. And if you happen to come from a good country, you might be worth 10 cents. 10 cents walking out of here. Not very much, folks. &gt;&gt; And if we carry on the way we're going, we're going to be below water. &gt;&gt; Young ladies, do you like what I'm saying? &gt;&gt; What am I worth? The same prophet says, "Your soul is worth 10,000 worlds." &gt;&gt; God's got 10,000 worlds in 10 cents worth of flesh. &gt;&gt; You talk about gold that perisheth. And your trial, where's your trial gone when you're gone? It's gone. Amen. &gt;&gt; It's going to disappear. &gt;&gt; What is your trial? Nothing. &gt;&gt; It's not even worth 10 cents. You say, "Oh, brother Biscll, if you only know, you listen to me." &gt;&gt; Your trial is issuing you, distressing you, and pushing you through a narrow spot called this life &gt;&gt; to put you into that place. &gt;&gt; And every demon of hell is coming against it. But God is determined to take you to it. &gt;&gt; Don't forget when Jesus was being squeezed a man of sorrows and acquainted with grief and the and and and brother Brandon talks about him being the lily and he was just crushed until that opium would come forth from that lily. Don't forget you were there. You were there &gt;&gt; and he had to be squeezed so that he could issue into a new body. &gt;&gt; It was that squeezing and that crushing that put him into a new body and you went into it with him. &gt;&gt; Glory to God. &gt;&gt; Does this sound like it's dream world or over your head? No. I'm sure this is very simple and fundamental and some of us our our circumstance and our situation in our life might make it difficult for us to believe it. I say you don't have an option. &gt;&gt; You must believe it. &gt;&gt; It is the only hope for the believer. &gt;&gt; This is not brother Ed's ideas. This is the word as clear as it can be. So he rose victorious in a new body. Bringing the elements of the body back. Listen. Bringing the elements of the body is God took of the clay and formed a body and breathed that spirit man into him. And he was god of the earth. Then the fall. Jesus came in a body back and took those same elements and restored them back to their original purpose in God's mind. A body that cannot fall. A body that cannot come into unbelief. the body. He brought forth the same elements back to prefall condition &gt;&gt; and that's where we're going. &gt;&gt; And I don't care how it happens or exactly when it happens. It'll happen in God's. But this is the program. &gt;&gt; This is the program. &gt;&gt; And that is why angels are, you know, we think angels in attendance and so on. That's why they're here because God has dispatched them. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Dispatch them to be by your side. Encourage them. Influence them. Cause them to feel your nearness. &gt;&gt; My own spirit will overshadow them. Seek to come into the service and overshadow them until they can be without question that it's God &gt;&gt; that's amongst them. I sent them a prophet who stood be in front of them and said, "Uh, you wonder what I'm looking at? I'm looking at him." &gt;&gt; Jesus Christ of Nazareth. Where was he in the building? &gt;&gt; If I could get you to believe, I could say, "All things are possible to them that believe these things, and nothing shall be impossible to them that believe it." Is this God's word? &gt;&gt; Is this the Bible? We're not just living here for a better job, for a better school, for a diploma. Well, that has nothing to do with that's worth 10 cents. &gt;&gt; I'm not even worried about people being delivered out of their problems or out of their trouble or out of their country or whatever more it is. It's only worth a few cents. But what God is seeking to do with this message you believe is to issue issue you with distress and pain of birth into a new world. [Music] And this message is here and that's why we're preaching such you say well we've heard that that might be even before this evening's service &gt;&gt; and you need this kind you in fact is your soul is calling for this message and this kind of preaching. So I said earlier, the Bible speaks of the ws of the devil. Why? Because he's got you targeted. &gt;&gt; I'm going to do everything in my power to get them to disbelieve or get them to hear something so they will doubt it. &gt;&gt; Don't you surrender up your faith. &gt;&gt; People if they want to disbelieve, it's up to them. &gt;&gt; If they want to have some other scheme, that's up to them. But don't you disbelieve this word. And there is no message and no person that I have ever found that God has vindicated like this message and say you want to just say I'm staying with the vindicated word of God and you do what you want with it. And I have brother Brandham's quote where he says now there it is. You do what you want with it. Amen. &gt;&gt; So our light affliction workketh for us and the trial of our faith is much more precious than gold that perisheth. The scripture says, "Who are kept by the power of God through faith unto salvation, ready to be revealed in the last time, &gt;&gt; wherein you greatly rejoice? Because we're to be revealed in the last time, we are we greatly re rejoice. Though now for a season, if need be, may not be everyone. If need be, you are in heaviness through manifold many temptations, that the trial of your faith, being much more precious than that of gold that perisheth, though it be tried with fire, might be found unto praise and honor and glory at the appearing of Jesus Christ. That's when the purpose of the trial will be made known. &gt;&gt; Amen. and for a season if it need be. &gt;&gt; That doesn't mean that we, you know, slug it out under incredible crushing burdens all the time, but when they come, and they will, then you know how to take them. I got my eye at the end. I see the end of this. I see the objective of God. now conditions and pressures of our time. And brother Brandon said this was a pressure age and some of you may not be experiencing it right now. Don't worry, you will. and others may appear not to have any and they have plenty or even more. Don't let me dwell on that, but I feel that's essential. He said, "Now this body, listen closely. I'm going to go slow. Now this body is subject to the spirit." This body is subject to the spirit. have not yet entered into the word form. This body is subject to the spirit. Have not yet entered into the word form, but we are still in the flesh form, but subject to the word. That's why you need to be here at church. That's why you need to hear the preaching of the word. Death in the flesh will take us there. How many here has had someone in your immediate family die and you went to their hold your hand up high, would you please? The Bible says that death is the last enemy. And I don't think there's any one of you that raised your hand that would say, "I found it a a a wonderful uh it was a friendly time and it was so wonderful." No, we were separated. We We perhaps didn't even understand it. I was the age of one of these boys. No doubt. I remember it like it was yesterday. I won't go into it. That's not why I'm here. It's an enemy. And the last enemy to be destroyed is death. And even even death with its reality, it's a squeezing. It's a distressing time. I'm going to preach. &gt;&gt; Our brethren in the world, the scripture says, experience the same things. &gt;&gt; But to them, it's a hopelessness. It's an end. It's a great dark tunnel. It's a nowhere. We're going nowhere. But to the believer, to the elect, that that is the last of the squeeze, the last of the pressure on this flesh. And this flesh gives in and surrenders and the call and the purpose of God and the testimony that person lived as the elect of Jesus Christ. They die in the faith. And their faith is greater than death itself. &gt;&gt; And they will rise in a new body. They'll rise. They heard the word all the time. And they were faithful to the word. They believed the word and they will rise to a word body. What kind of body? I don't know. I don't care. The prophet said it. If thus sayeth the Lord. And just like I couldn't understand this body when I was still in my father's uh in his loins. I don't I couldn't understand this body. Now I'm in it. And I still don't understand it. I don't understand why it gets stronger, why it gets weaker. All of these things. I don't understand it, but I believe it. And this body and God has allowed the trials and he who is the God of this evil age to encircle you and to do all kinds of things and to create obstacles and everything else so that God can prove that that life that is in you by predestination will only be improved by those struggles. not be overcome but will overcome them &gt;&gt; even though now for a season we may experience these things. Are you staying with me? &gt;&gt; He says and then when this robe of flesh is dropped I'm not going to keep you long today. So just I just want your attention. When this robe of flesh is dropped, there is a natural body theophony, &gt;&gt; a body not made with hands, neither born of a woman that we go to. That we go to. Let me hear everybody say that we go to. &gt;&gt; That we go to. &gt;&gt; I didn't hear it loud enough. That we go to. &gt;&gt; I want to hear you say that I go to. &gt;&gt; That I go. &gt;&gt; There is a body that I go to. Amen. &gt;&gt; When the body of this flesh is dropped, there's a body I go to. &gt;&gt; Not made with hands and not born of a woman, it is a word body. &gt;&gt; It's the same kind. Jesus demonstrated that body when he came out of the grave. &gt;&gt; He said, "Handle me. I'm not a spirit. Handle me." [Applause] And men, brethren, like us, handled the body that we go to. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; For the scripture says he will give us a glorious body like unto his glorious body. &gt;&gt; And let me say something further so that you don't disconnect it. And that is why God sent a prophet who could stand on the pull at the platform in front of the multitudes and say to you who are locked in this physical frame, I'm looking at him. [Music] &gt;&gt; Oh my friends, I'm so moved. I would just like to go to my study and bury my head and thank him. It's so real. It's so real. &gt;&gt; And to think that God Almighty, he didn't have to do it, but he did it for you and he did it for me. &gt;&gt; Whatever you do, don't take this lightly. &gt;&gt; I'm having respect for the message and what's being preached. And he said that we go to then then this is the program then that body talking about yours and mine that we're going to this one came from a natural birth. The other one came from a spiritual birth. We're talking about the spirit world. We were born again by the spirit of God. &gt;&gt; By the word of God. And by the spirit, the spirit came to the word. And thus, we became alive, a new person in Christ Jesus. &gt;&gt; Now, don't get it lost in the phrases of born again. All these world talks about born again. Forget it. &gt;&gt; Just think what a messenger has said about the new birth. &gt;&gt; And then we're born again, a spirit man. He says, "Then the body returns back and picks up the glorified body." And that's the reason Jesus went to hell when he died and preached to the souls that were in prison. &gt;&gt; In prison, &gt;&gt; they're locked into another kind of a framework &gt;&gt; that they cannot get out of. &gt;&gt; They can repent and pray, but never get out of that prison. Oh, aren't you thankful to God that while you're imprisoned in this body of flesh, you were able to hear the gospel of Jesus Christ that overcome this prison and broke the bars. Amen. &gt;&gt; I think of Dy Rambo's song. This house of clay is but a prison and bars of bone hold my soul. But the doors of clay are going to burst wide open. When the angel sets my spirit free, I'll take my flight like a mighty angel. when the hills of home start calling me and I will say as a public declaration over this pulpit and to all who hear me, the angel has already come and the bursts of the the doors of the of the doors of bone and the have burst open and the soul and the spirit that God has placed in there has come out and with the faith to believe what the old Ed Visal could not believe. And today I believe it. &gt;&gt; And today I cannot disbelieve it. There's no capacity in me. I hear everything everybody is saying. And this world is so filled and so vulgar and so unclean. We are we're we're not made for it. &gt;&gt; Am I preaching to this congregation? &gt;&gt; I'm not mad. I'm serious. And he returned to the souls that were in prison and preached to the souls that were in prison and turned back into that theophony. Oh, marvelous. He said, "Thank God. We may not understand. I tell you what, if we had a prophet, we could understand everything he said. It wouldn't be much of a prophet. &gt;&gt; Read it. read the book of Ezekiel and come and tell me and write a write a thesis on it. &gt;&gt; I tell you what, they'll put you in a loony boony bin. It's come from inspiration of God. &gt;&gt; And then he speaks of the he goes on to say the earthly body be dissolved. This earthly tabernacle we have another. So we have bypassed that to come straight from God. &gt;&gt; Amen. And then he he quotes that scripture and then he says then we become the word. &gt;&gt; Here we are formed to the word image to be a partaker of the word feed on the word by being predestinated since the beginning. &gt;&gt; Then we become the word &gt;&gt; because even the traces of this body are gone. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Jesus said, now we talk about him for a moment. Jesus said in Luke 12:50, "But I have a baptism to be baptized with, and how am I straightened straight in a straight?" How am I straightened until it be accomplished? I have a baptism. He asked the disciples. They wanted so much to follow him. He said, "Are ye able to drink the cup that I drink and be baptized with the baptism? Are you willing to enter up into enter the straits?" &gt;&gt; Listen friends, you're in the straight. &gt;&gt; Every time you go to Victoria, cross the straight of Wanda Fuca or the straight of Georgia or something. What is it? It's a whole ocean coming into a narrow place. You have a whole ocean. &gt;&gt; A whole ocean. &gt;&gt; A whole ocean of the almighty God. [Music] &gt;&gt; That has put you down and has put a part of himself into you. And that is why you feel so constrained and so restricted and oh, I'd like to just burst out of this. You're quiet. And I know why you're quiet. Because I've hitten the nail on the head. &gt;&gt; Every person is that way. Sometimes I get disappointed with myself. I can't express myself to my wife, so I don't say anything. And they say, "Well, some say you should tell your wife that you love her every morning." Well, that might be okay, but I say don't say it unless you really mean it. And not likely as every morning. Said, "Don't just feel like it." There's one time when you should do it, even if you don't feel like it. Now you come into the church and and and David said, "I will say to my soul, &gt;&gt; praise the Lord." &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. He tells his soul, "You do it. &gt;&gt; I don't care how you feel and I'm disregarding this body." You say it anyway. &gt;&gt; So let us say, "Praise the Lord." &gt;&gt; Don't let anybody in here say, "I don't feel like it." Because God doesn't care how you feel. I don't care how you feel. It's the devils that are trying to work on it. Amen. &gt;&gt; He he spoke of Jesus Christ the lily of the valley. Let me just go for a little bit more and I'm I'm not going to be too long now. He says, "And how am I straightened till it be accomplished?" And straightened is here's what it is. It is to be pressed on every side. Has anybody here felt like that? &gt;&gt; Like a straight forces a ship into a narrow channel. Like a cattle squeeze pushing in on each side. Forcing the beast into a position where it cannot move. To completely, i.e. to hold fast a prisoner to constrain to be held with to be afflicted with to be suffering from. This is what it is. I'm in a straight &gt;&gt; and I can't move from it. I must do it. &gt;&gt; And even as I said last week when he came to the garden, he asked the disciples, "Could you wait with me?" &gt;&gt; He even desired he was a man. &gt;&gt; Could you wait with me &gt;&gt; and watch with me? And they were unable. And he said, "Father, if it be possible, let this cup pass from me, but nevertheless, not my will, but thine be done." &gt;&gt; He was formed. You might you might wonder why I'm taking so much of this service because we need to hear it &gt;&gt; and it will help us to take the whimper away. I do not like the trials and persecutions. You do not like the trials and persecutions. Now, these are not the ws of the devil. The ws of the devil you withstand. &gt;&gt; Satan is fighting and struggling and he's trying to get me to disbelieve. He's trying to get me to doubt the promise of God. I refuse him. I reject him and I resist him. He's trying to put an affliction on me. It's not from God. I resist him. I'm going to abide by the word of God. Is that all right? &gt;&gt; But Jesus was squeezed under pressure. And that is to be like a man of sorrows. I've said a a man with a sense of infinitely greater capacity. Notice Jesus was God in the flesh. No one has really fully experienced. He was the fullness of the godhead bodily. In him &gt;&gt; was the power to speak universes into existence. A man that walked here on the same soil. If you believe that Bible, if you don't believe that, you better pitch the Bible away. That's what it is. He was God in the flesh. &gt;&gt; And people could not believe he was God in the flesh. He who spoke worlds into existence. You realize the tree that he hung on, his own word brought forth that tree. &gt;&gt; His own word brought forth the iron that made the nails that held him there. He could have called for 10,000 angels or millions if he'd wanted to. He could have destroyed the world and started all over again. But he was hanging there. And you and I were hanging with him. He must bring forth and he come forth and under that incredible pressure and strain. And the prophets uh the prophet uh enlarges on how he was how he how he was under the agony and he was brutalized. &gt;&gt; Oh, I have so much to say. God help me and God God help you to stay alert. going through the narrow straits of death because out of that he was going to burst into a new world and just the other side of it he will have accomplished it so he'd be able to say it is finished &gt;&gt; it is finished &gt;&gt; I have dispensed with the curse. I have brought back the original purpose. I took the soil of the earth and brought it to its judgment. And now I'm going to rise. No man takes my life from me. I lay it down. I give it up &gt;&gt; and I'll take it up again. &gt;&gt; The reason why I'm stumbling around is because I have another what thought that I do not want to pass over and a thief. &gt;&gt; That's right. on this side, &gt;&gt; and a thief on this side, both going through the same straits, &gt;&gt; both going through the same squeeze, &gt;&gt; both having experienced incredible trials, but one ended up with Christ &gt;&gt; and the other one ended up with Judas. &gt;&gt; Are you still with me? And so for one his trials were worth nothing didn't meaningless and the other one his trials were also meaningless but he had no he had no objective and this one on Jesus right side he entered into paradise you know people today I try to entice people to become Christians oh you know Jesus loves you. He does. But don't you want to be happy? Of course you do. You know, and they try to entice them, you know, that Jesus is just nice and just waiting for you and so and so. That wasn't it. Jesus didn't try to entice him. He didn't say, "Hey, do you want to be in paradise with me tomorrow?" &gt;&gt; He let him suffer like a man. &gt;&gt; He let him die like a man. &gt;&gt; He didn't try to entice him with anything. He just said, "Today you'll be with me in paradise." &gt;&gt; And he died. But what he suffered and I don't know about his life. I don't know what brought him to be a criminal. I don't know what brought him to be a treacherous man. And they said those kind of people that had those kind of deaths generally burglarized and and committed crime even maybe by murder to get their get what they wanted. And this man everything he went through was erased. He went through the straits and entered into a new birth, into a new life. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; I'm not done. So just hang with me please. It was pressed on every side, formed and squeezed under the pressure and tested. Jesus was God in the flesh. &gt;&gt; And the suffering of the flesh pressed or restricted or squeezed until the spirit was released. Oh, I thank God &gt;&gt; that he didn't escape it &gt;&gt; until the spirit was released. &gt;&gt; Listen to me. Bible way. &gt;&gt; Listen to me. Everyone that may be streaming. That was absolutely essential. &gt;&gt; If if he hadn't been struck with the spear and the spirit was released and he released his spirit, &gt;&gt; that's what gave you life. You were imprisoned in that body. &gt;&gt; That was your whole hope. &gt;&gt; Not only for to be a Christian here. That's just the beginning of it. &gt;&gt; It is another life. Don't you want to go to heaven? &gt;&gt; Don't you want to have another body? &gt;&gt; Don't you want to have another life? &gt;&gt; That's this gospel. And that's why this God sent this messenger &gt;&gt; with this message. &gt;&gt; And I'm moving you on &gt;&gt; in that direction. &gt;&gt; And that's why I said at the beginning of this service, this is not just a message. It's not just a sermon. The suffering of the flesh body was indeed a bitter cup. Even Jesus himself saying as I said earlier, "Oh my father, if it be possible, let this cup pass from me. Nevertheless, not my will but thine be done." I suppose not many. But how many knowath the old olive tree? Do you know, Linda? Maybe get a microphone to to my wife. You won't. You can't. Then I will some of these old saints had such incredible capacity. Just before we come to that, listen to here's a I don't think this is a song, but it's a part of a poem. Do I have a little time? &gt;&gt; Oh, mean may seem this house of clay, yet it was the Lord's abode. Our feet may mourn this thorny way. Yet here Emmanuel trod. This fleshly robe the Lord did wear. This watch the Lord did keep. These burdens soar the Lord did bear. These tears the Lord did weep. This world the master overcame. This death the Lord did die. Oh vanquished world. Oh glorious shame. Oh hallowed agony. Oh veil of tears no longer sad wherein the Lord did dwell. Oh holy robe of flesh that clad our own Emmanuel. Our very frailty brings us near unto the Lord of heaven. To every grief, to every tear, such glory strange is given. But not this fleshly robe alone shall link us, Lord, to thee. Not only in the tear and groan shall the dear kindred be. We shall be reckoned for thine own because thy heaven we share because we sing around the throne and thy bright raignment wear. Thou who was clothed in our clay and stricken in ourstead will put on us thy bright array. Thy joy on us will shed a body like unto his glorious body. Almighty grace our life to live to make our earth divine. Almighty grace thy heaven to give and lift our life to thine. In order to do that he went alone. He asked his most faithful three, will you wait with me? And they failed him. And he went alone. Neath the old olive trees. Neath the old olive trees went the Savior alone on his knees. Not my will, thine be done, cried the Father's own son, as he knelt the old olive trees. Neath the old olive trees. Neath the old olive trees went the Savior alone on his knees. Not my will. Thine be done, cried the father's own son as he knelt neath the old olive trees. Neath the old olive trees. Beneath the old olive trees went the Savior. Alone on his knees. Not my will. Thine be done, cried the Father's own son, as he knelt neat the old olive trees. And then the agony began. But I was crying out for birth. I was in a womb of this world and I was crying for birth. &gt;&gt; Not this life, another life. I need to go back to my origin. &gt;&gt; What did you intend? What was my purpose? &gt;&gt; And God allowed you to be born. While a prophet walked and while a message came, a message that would in every way acquaint the people. Acquaint a few people that will see it and understand it. Acquaint a few people. Oh, there there is another world. While this one looks like this is all there is. All the trinkets and all the little fan dangles as brother Bradup calls it. While the world and Satan is dazzling the world and enchanting and hanging everything in front of them and nice cars and nice clothes and nice this and that that more technology trying to seduce them. But then comes a little light through the darkness and a word comes and I realize there's another world and that's what my soul has cried for. &gt;&gt; I cannot be content with this. &gt;&gt; Great men have gone. I say the pharaohs and the super powers of the past. Where are they? &gt;&gt; People have risen up against this prophet. &gt;&gt; Where are they? &gt;&gt; I drove across. I was on the freeway. I was listening to the prophet of God speak. And I just thought, here's the traffic. It's many lanes of traffic going every direction. And I just looked up and I thought, "How many are hearing what I'm hearing?" How many hear this? &gt;&gt; How many hear a man, a human born like I was, born in sin like I was? I say there's another dimension. I mean that dimension. And then tell me someplace else. You go as a Christian to that dimension. Oh God, I don't want to miss that. I'm crying out to this congregation. Don't miss that place. You young men just starting out, you if you have not already, which you probably have, but you'll face a lot of things yet in life. Your own. They're your own. You young ladies, you'll face many trials, but you stay with this word. &gt;&gt; Maybe a testing, stay pure, stay godly. You young families and husbands, mothers, assume your full responsibility and don't worry about who the next what the next person is doing. It's irrelevant. It's not even worth 10 cents. All these trials and all these things that come your way, they are only a means. And the scripture says it clearly. They work for you. And so when it comes, that's why these old-timers say, "Come trial. &gt;&gt; Come burdens, &gt;&gt; do your work." &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. I'm being perfected &gt;&gt; and I'm being issued into another world. &gt;&gt; You believe that? Jesus so knew. He so knew because he was the word and yet because he was a natural man just like you and I. There was that side of him that didn't want to suffer, but yet the other side of him. So here's here's two phrases that I'm closing. Father, in the agony and great drops of sweat as though it were blood, they say that they even the vessels inside it broken. Father, if it be possible, let this cup pass from me. Nevertheless, not my will thine be done. And the same person, I'll say it over to this side, said to the leaders, destroy this temple, and I'll raise it up in three days. &gt;&gt; Welcome. Come ahead. Destroy this temple. because he knew the word of God. He could not see corruption. &gt;&gt; And he would put that word to the test. Beyond their persecution and beyond their ridicule and beyond their false accusations, I'll put my faith in the promise of God. This flesh shall not see corruption. &gt;&gt; And he only believed the word that you have to believe. Exactly the same word. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. And so he said, "Destroy this temple." And if you wish to look it up as I close, he was saying the word destroy is used two different ways in the Greek language. And the one is pull it down, destroy it, and and completely do away with it. The other one is loose it. The other destroy is loose it. And one time Jesus used it and it is to destroy and completely annihilate something. Bring it down. Tear it down. But when he said destroy this temple, he said literally loose me. &gt;&gt; You have no power. All you can do is loose me. &gt;&gt; I'm going through the straight, but on the other side I'll be loosed. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. I have power to lay it down. I have power to take it off again. Larry, are you listening to me? The prophet of God said, "You can say that." &gt;&gt; Why? Because you believe the same word he believed. And then when he stood and when he stood and they brought they called him and I won't go into the story, but Lazarus was in the grave already, already stinking four days in the grave in that hot country. And he said, "Lazarus, come forth." And he came forth bound cuz they put the they put the swaththing on him and he said, "Loose him. &gt;&gt; Let him go." That was exactly the same word. Loose me. Destroy me. And all you can do is loose me to the greater work. All you can do is loose me to the greater calling. Friends, I want to go on I want to go on uh on on testimony today. I want to testify to the world. I want to say to the spared world, Satan, you have no power over us. You have no power over me. All you can do is loose us. Even if you should succeed in taking me to death, all you can do is loose me to my greater calling, to my higher calling, to the purpose that God sent me here for. Loose me. Hallelujah. When Satan comes against you, you can say the same thing. In the name of Jesus Christ, I have power over you. Loose me. [Music] to my full purpose. &gt;&gt; And when it looks as though he's conquering you and and sending you to defeat, you know, you will rise beyond that. Not only victorious, &gt;&gt; I'm looking at you young people. The reason I look at you is I was young. &gt;&gt; My wife was young and now we are old or seasoned or whatever you want to call it. But I can tell you there isn't a there isn't a second of my life that I would have traded for this life. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And I'm so thankful for God for having opened up. If the message hadn't opened up, if the prophet of God hadn't come and preached this message, I wouldn't have been able to preach this service today. These things are unlocked by the message of the hour. I say glory to God. And Satan can do nothing with all the antics he has in this age and all the enticements he has in this age. The only thing he can do is is is is squeeze you further. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. It's just squeezing you on. &gt;&gt; And the prophet talks about birth pains &gt;&gt; and he says that this world cannot take another one. That's the world now. Not you, but the world. I'm not talking about worldly man. I'm talking about the earth. said they had one birth pain, World War I, second birth pain, World War II, and it says with everything it has in the ground now and the missiles and atomic warfare and so on, it can't stand another one. &gt;&gt; Another one will birth it right into a new world. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Glory to God. Friends, we're there. &gt;&gt; We're there. Let's bow our heads together, shall we? Father, I am mindful today. So mindful of the cost and what you have done and what you have brought us in the message you have sent us, the reality of it. in all humility. Lord, I thank you for another opportunity to stand and declare the faith that is in my soul and in my being. I thank you for this message. I want the world to know how much we uh believe it and love it. Lord, we love you. We love you. We love you. Oh, how we love you, Lord. And I trust that this group of people that are here present can only say we love this word, this Lord Jesus Christ. And indeed, you have come. You have come in word form to tell us where we're going and how to get there. You've told us how to deal with the issues of this life and how not to be overcome by it and how not to surrender up to it. Lord, we will not surrender our faith and our our our joy and our we just will not surrender up this revealed word. Lord, I pray blessings upon this people. I pray that there will be a release of the Holy Spirit upon them &gt;&gt; and may there be a sense of joy and peace and comfort in Jesus Christ's name. Lord Jesus, for any that are here and while I'm praying now, you may want to raise your hand if you are one that is burdened beyond expression and you need a friend. Oh, what a friend. What a friend we have in Jesus. Oh spirit of God, you came here and walked with us and walked amongst us and you know every detail of everything that we experience. I pray father would you at this moment allow that your presence your your personal presence by your holy spirit and the attending angels to come and surround oh god &gt;&gt; you said the angels are wanting to influence us towards him and the cherubam's inviting the people to come back to the tree of life. &gt;&gt; Oh God. Oh God. May they come and may they freely eat. And we have eaten today. Lord, I pray you'll bless your people as we partake in the name of Jesus Christ. Thank you, Lord. Thank you, Lord. Let's stand, shall we? If you feel a need to linger, you feel a need of prayer, we're happy to do that for you. Let's sing. Oh, what a friend. A friend who walks beside me to hold my hand and safely guide me. Safe in his arms. He always hide me. All the bre [Music] my way. He car around my pathway [Music] and he'll take me through take me through when [Music] Oh my [Music] he knows the
