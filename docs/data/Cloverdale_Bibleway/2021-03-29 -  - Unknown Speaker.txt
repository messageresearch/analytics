TRANSCRIPT
========================================
the standard is the standard is every seed must bring forth after his own kind and god is the first one that prophesied he gave a prophecy god actually prophesied and the prophecy is concerning seed and he comes to the serpent and he says i'll put enmity between you and the woman and between your seed and her seed and her seed was going to be nothing other than the new created seed of almighty god god was god was speaking and prophesying again that he's going to create a new seed and jesus christ would be the beginning of a new creation hallelujah and i say to you today he transformed himself into spoken word and uttered his word and spoke in this generation the spoken word is the original seed and has brought forth original children after his kind and there's a great struggle going on for us to to dilute and to water down and to take away from the emphasis and the importance of it i resist the spirit of this laodicea with everything that's in me i resist it in the name of jesus christ it is the enemy of god and i wanted this church rise up because this is your time to shine this is your time to make yourself known this is your time to be able to tell the world we're not just a church we're sons and daughters of the living god we've been birthed by the eternal seed of almighty god and i refuse to be reduced down to a nominal christian it's a lukewarm generation hallelujah i refuse it in the name of jesus christ and as a servant of christ today i say satan you're defeated hallelujah you perverter of the seed of god you cannot pervert this seed [Applause] hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah he's filled our streets with filth and vile things you rub shoulders with it every day i deny it in the name of jesus christ with everything that's in me i deny it this perverted spirit will have no part of the message i'm not talking about the perversion of the flesh i'm talking about the perversion of the word of god
