We're born to fly. &gt;&gt; We're not born to be earthbound. We're not born to be natural. Just live a life and then that's it. Job saw something more. And I believe that that's our revelation as well. I've asked brother Michael Ray to come and help us sing this morning. When believing becomes my victory. I appreciate brother Michael. God gives gifts in the body and I believe it's for all of us to enjoy. So you help him sing. I'm going to enjoy it. I told him if it's for one, sign me up. It's for me. I love this song. I love to hear the saints of God sing it. Amen. &gt;&gt; It's not hard to believe. Standing on the mountain tops of glory. Amen. Oh, and you can hear the songs of angels and the breeze from heaven send your spirit so real. Oh, but in the valley once more, will Jesus still be Lord? That's the question. Cuz believing in believing isn't easy. That is the testing. Well, I need for a time when the sun does not shine and the mountain top is just a memory. When there's no sign to be seen and I don't feel to the word of God and I tr my way and I just don't understand what it means. That's when nothing else will you do. It alone will see me through and believe it becomes my victory. Oh, it's not hard to believe things are going well. The skies are sunny. Oh, when you feel making progress, doing good time, would you still keep the faith? That's the question. Oh, cuz believe when is easy. Oh, when the sun doesn't shine is just there's no sign to see and I don't do the word God and I pray for when troules come my way just understand what he well that's when nothing else will do the Lord will see me And while we stand for again to Heat. Heat. I for the day when the tr come my way and that's when nothing else will do. May the Lord see through and believe becomes my victory. I sh Have you ever been there? Do your work.

I believe you're my more than enough for me. Jesus. I believe I might. You are. Oh, let faith drop in your heart. this morning, saints. He is more than enough for us. Hallelujah. He's more than our daily bread. We need his word. Hallelujah. Jesus, you're just lifted up once more. Sing it out again. Hallelujah. I believe you're mighty healer. I believe you are all I believe. I believe. I believe you're my I believe for me. Jesus, you're all I need. Hallelujah. Why don't we just pray together this morning? Heavenly Father, your word has declared it and we believe it. &gt;&gt; As Jacob said, we have enough. &gt;&gt; You, oh God, are all that we need. &gt;&gt; Oh God, we stand behind your word this morning. Just reflecting on a little story that our prophet told us. There was a battlefield one day and everything was destroyed. But underneath the rock, a little flower was pushing up. Beneath all the debris, beneath all the confusion, all the death, a little flower was pushing up because it had been hidden behind the rock. Lord, may we find ourselves this morning hidden behind that rock of ages. Lord, if one has not found themselves there, may they fall upon that rock, Lord. May they cry out, "Oh God, save me as blind Barnameus cried out one day." Oh son of David, have mercy upon me. Lord, we stand in a generation, Lord, that's cold and indifferent. They don't want to cry out to you, Lord, but we want to cry out and say, "Come quickly, Lord Jesus. &gt;&gt; Be our portion today. Father, &gt;&gt; be with the minister, Lord, as he comes. Take our pastor, Lord. &gt;&gt; Lord, use him this morning to speak to your people. Feed the sheep and feed the lambs. Take our brother Tom this morning, Lord. Even as he's prepared his heart for this service this evening in Seattle, your children are gathering, Lord, to feed upon the body word of the Son of Man. Lord, may each and everyone receive their portion. Oh God, that is good for today. Lord, if there's one that has need of healing in their body, may faith drop into their heart this morning, see you as that risen lamb that has come, spend their propitiation, Lord. If there's one that is dead in sin and trespasses, would they look to Calvary this morning and see the blood, Lord, and claim that blood of Jesus Christ that was shed on their behalf? You sent your only son into the world to save the lost. &gt;&gt; Lord, we thank you for redemption's price that has been paid. Oh God, we have received the atonement and we give you thanks this morning to be able to stand in the household of faith as your bride being robed in your righteousness. &gt;&gt; We accept it this morning. &gt;&gt; We believe it. There's nothing that we have done that would merit it. Father, &gt;&gt; but this morning we want to say thank you, Jesus. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. And may your Holy Spirit so overshadow this congregation this morning that one would not be able to leave and say that they did not see you. May we be different this morning, Lord. Meet us in a special way, we pray. We'll be sure to give you all the thanks and all the glory and the honor. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Brother Jim Douly and family, we'd like to thank you all so much for your prayers. God has and thank God for his grace and healing power. Touching brother Jim, the family has asked that refrain from visiting for the next week or so as he is very weak and tired in his body needs to recover. So we trust that you'll honor that request from the family. Amen. He is at home resting. God bless you, Sister Patricia. Brother Ules. Amen. You may have your seats this morning. Sister Elena Hendrickson's got a special for us. It's a song that I believe that you wrote. It's called My Story. So, it's real nice. The verses are very good. So, listen to the words. Brother Roger Gerard, you here this morning? Is that Brother Roger? Why don't you stand up, Brother Roger, with your wife this morning, Sister Sandre, God bless you. Why don't we welcome them this morning from Tucson, Arizona. Good to have you here with us. I believe that's your daughter from up in se down in Seattle, actually. So, you're up visiting her and it's very nice to have you here the service this morning. There's any other visitors with us, we certainly want to say God bless you and welcome you to the service. those on the internet hook up say God bless you to you as well sister Elena. Satan picked up a pen and he wrote down what I used to leave. He placed all he could in a book. Displayed it for the world to see. But when I knelt at the cross and gave Jesus my life, I laid that book at his feet. He opened the cover, dipped in his blood, and wrote, "Redemption complete." But that's not the end of the story. God wrote a new chapter for me. Then he tore out the pages, stained and unclean, and wrote that I'm pardoned and free. The blood covered all of my sin and regret. All the past was fully erased. When God, the great author, reached down in his grace and took all those pages away. And now I'm walking with him. As he works his plan out in me, he gives me new mercy each morning and blessings abundantly. And sometimes when Satan still comes to remind me he once had power and sway, I simply remind him what happened back there and stand on the word. As I say, that's not the end of the story. God wrote a new chapter for me. And then he tore out those pages stained and unclean and wrote that I'm pardoned and free. The blood covered all of my sin and regret. All the past was fully erased. When God the great author reached down in his grace and took all those pages away. One day I'll close the book forever. When my work on earth is done, I'll stand in his presence forgiven and clean. When this race of life is run, he'll open the book up and see all the pages he wrote through all of my days. Then say, "Take your place. My spot is bright. Nothing stands in your way." But that's still not the end of the story. The last chapter only begins. For together in heaven, we'll talk of his grace and rejoice all over again. Give him all glory for all that he has done. And by his side I will praise and thank the redeemer for that wondrous day when he took all my old life away. I will thank the redeemer for that wondous day when he took all those pages away. Amen. Amen. Thank you for that special sister Lena. It's not the end of the story. &gt;&gt; Amen. Why don't we sing together my hope is in the Lord as we get ready to change the order of the service. Ask our pastor to come this morning. Amen. It's good to have everybody here this morning. I stand in all within the presence of the Lord. Through the wisdom of the aes. The raing of the se the living source of life. Oh my god mercies con every rising The sour Heat. Heat. Heat. Heat. Forever is the Lord. Forever more. Why we sing the first verse again? I stand in all the presence of Lord. Heat. Heat. Heat. Heat. Heat. Heat. Heat. Heat. Heat. Heat. Ever forever more. Let's blend our voices together. My hope is in the Lord. from this time on and ever more. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Yes, Lord. Forever. &gt;&gt; My hope is in the Lord. From this time on and ever more. Oh my hope is in the Lord forever. &gt;&gt; Amen. Good morning to everyone. &gt;&gt; It's a good day when we can come into the house of God &gt;&gt; and have the freedom and liberty. &gt;&gt; Amen. To worship the living God. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; I want to say before we go any further that we certainly appreciate all of those that are live streaming the service. We uh appreciate your uh the time that you take to some people have to get up in the middle of the night and but they want to be in that service and they can get it archived but they like to have it live streamed and be here in real time. So, however it works out and I do want to say that we appreciate so much the emails that you send and the encouragement sometime perhaps you may think that uh there's nobody on this end. We're here and I read them all and I answer most of them. I have a uh for those you haven't got an answer, it's coming. It'll just be a few days. We just have a a lot of things that are going on. And I also want to thank you for your offerings and your gifts. And it does there is costs associated with it. You have to have people involved and and there are some costs with it. And and so I'm glad for those of you that are conscious of that and you give it just is really appreciated on this end. And then others hear about mission projects and they send in offerings. They send in offerings. two of them I think at least uh brother Louise came from for Argentina and Chile came from the internet and we really appreciated that. God bless you in your giving. And uh also I wonder should we be saying something about the camp? It's rushing right up on us. &gt;&gt; Why don't you say something about it then? Send the man who knows. &gt;&gt; Amen. Who's excited about camp coming on? Amen. &gt;&gt; I've talked to brother Aaron McGiri, talked to brother Danny Stemann, and they are are both just under great anticipation and expectation to be a part of this camp this year. So, we put ourselves aside and I'm sure there's many ones that have have prayed. Uh I know the prayer meetings have have uh remembered the camp. You know, we've had some tremendous camps. This is our 25th year. And I I think it's a great privilege that I've uh been u a part of this this burden for our young people to see our children grow up in the presence of God and then to see young men and young ladies raise up and they're the they're our strength and they're our helpers at this camp. I want to thank you all all the counselors that have preparing themselves for their cabins. I want you to know young people, we do this because we love you. And as I said to the counselors last week, Brother Ed, I hope you just don't mind a moment. I took the scripture where Paul said to King Agria, I was not disobedient to the heavenly vision. &gt;&gt; And I believe our pastor had a vision 25 years ago that this would not just be a young people's camp that this would be a family camp where our families, our daddies and our mommies could come together and have a special time in his presence. And I can say with Paul, I have not been disobedient to that vision. That we have put our efforts together to move this church forward to have a blessed time in his presence. And may God come down on this 25th anniversary and give us a special camp. Amen. That will be starting next week in August. Now, I've got my dates going around in my head. We start the 10th. August 10th on the Monday 8th. Sorry. August 8th, 8th, 9th, and 10th for the young people. And then we'll go into our senior camp. God bless you. Remember brother Danny Stemann and brother Aaron McGary. Thank you. See, we don't even make a very big thing at the 25th anniversary. You know why? Eternal beings. What's What's 25 years? It's not even a breath. Uh we're we're going right into eternity. We're not saying we're going to have eternal life. We have eternal life. &gt;&gt; Amen. We're just enjoying it. Uh we're don't enjoying it as much as we can down here right now, but we're on our way to enjoy it a whole lot more and we're living for that day. Uh so you know it's wonderful to have people engaged in the camp and a good number of them that were that are working there now were actually dedicated on the platform dedicated as children on the platform. It's nice to see them you know at at full uh uh shall I say in the full responsibility. So we're we're really happy about that. Uh I also wanted to give a word of thanks and this is sincere. This isn't to fill in time for those that have uh have come and labored on a daily basis or as often as you could to assist our brother Kim Dingwald, brother Ben, his son working with him. And then uh their family, I mean there's quite a few of the family that have come, the brother Kim's family, sister Hedi and Beth and and then I want to say that there are other families uh brother Tom Frey and sister Kim their family and their their sons are around there working almost on a daily basis. In fact, as I said to Kim this last week, do you live here? seemed like she lived there every time the meal is on and the sisters have been providing uh evening meal and and lunch at noon and but evening meal and it's just a it's really surprising and amazing what is taking place and it needs to take place. I just saw a little note this last week. The enrollment for the school has gone up 30% over last year of those that want to be there this year. And uh uh we have Sister Sapora is here from Edmonton. Sister Zapora, would you just stand please at the back? Uh they are they are just acquiring a home and four of their five children are being enrolled in the c in the school and that's that just happened very very recently and there are others uh like sister Zapora and her husband who is in Ghana right now waiting to uh find a way just to be here on a permanent basis. And let's take that up in prayer. I want to say something to the congregation. I just want to speak hearttoheart for a moment. This civilization and the prophet, our prophet said, "This civilization's of the devil." Did he say it? &gt;&gt; Did he say it? &gt;&gt; Do you believe what he said? &gt;&gt; This civilization has has it it's it's wonderful a lot of ways. You can get on a plane and be on the other side of the world in a in a few hours. But also, Satan has used that in his civilization. This is Satan's Eden. And he'll take a family and put a family here and the fathers on the other side of the world or the fathers on the other side of the country. And and yet that's not what's in their heart. What's in their heart is to be home with their family, to be home with their children. And uh and that's God's order. And so I find that we as a body of Jesus Christ, we need to pray and do more than pray. We need to put feet to our to our prayers. And I personally have been working very very hard because I've seen this and just recently I've seen this as a real attack against the program and the structure of God's order for homes, for families, for churches, scatter people all over the face of the globe and and dismember. That's the first thing he did in the Garden of Eden was dismember the family. And we're here to put it back together again. And if the immigration's against it, we're going to try to find a way. If something else is against it, we're going to try to overcome it. And sometimes uh I I I don't hesitate. If a if a job is going to permanently put a husband and wife and family and father away from each other on a permanent basis, I realize there are times when we have to put our best foot forward and there's an opportunity and we we have to do something. I would say outside of the gospel of Jesus Christ, sometimes the gospel of Jesus Christ calls for men to be away in the ministry and whatever more, but outside of that, I like to see families united. Don't you think so? &gt;&gt; I hope I can have a solid amen out of this congregation. And so, God bless you that are laboring. I can tell you there's there's been incredible amount of uh of of progress that has been made. And I'm anxious for it. not merely for the school. We we need what is being used by the school right now. We need that to expand and extend the missions. We need some of those rooms up there and they're also used for Sunday school. And there are functions which are taking place within the church which we don't have room to handle it right now, but we'll be able to use the school gymnasium for that. And so we're anxious to see it done because we just believe it's God's work. And when it's done, we'll just hand it over in the tribulation. Whoever wants it can have it. &gt;&gt; We're out of here. &gt;&gt; I say we're out of here. &gt;&gt; And they can have it. &gt;&gt; Who's going to have it? I don't know. Antichrist or somebody. I couldn't care less. &gt;&gt; Say, "Well, I'm doing all this work." No, you're not doing it for him. You're doing it for God. We're do everything as unto the Lord. &gt;&gt; All your giving and all your sacrifice. God bless you. God bless you. I did see on the screen our brother Roger Gerard and Sister Sandra stand up and their daughter. I appreciate that. God bless you, brother Roger, Sister Sandra, your daughter. And uh tonight we're going to be down in Seattle. Uh, I'm going to drive down today because there's going to be a they're going to have like a a little special time of fellowship after and and since they got the new building and brother Tom will be ministering down there. So, we're just thankful for the people from Seattle, Tacoma, Mount Vernon, wherever they come from. Some of our people are away today. This is a long a long weekend holiday weekend in Canada. of some of the people are away and and uh let's stand and I want to sing I'm amazed that he loved me and then we're going to read the scripture mother that he loved me. Yeah. Heat. Heat. Heat. Yeah. Heat. Heat. Heat. Heat. Heat. Heat. Heat. Heat. I see my how we thank you, Father, that you've made yourself known in a perfect redemption. I pray now as we will turn to your word that you will bless your people with an understanding. Bless your people, oh God, with the grace of God, the anointing of the Holy Spirit. May the spirit of revelation be upon us. May every obstacle be moved out, oh God. May there be no hindrance whatsoever in any man, any woman's mind. I pray, Lord, that you will grace us with your presence. All we want is you. Only you, Lord Jesus. I pray that you will endow us with your power. May the word not be in word only, but in demonstration and power of the Holy Spirit. Reach out into the audience, oh God, whether it be here or whether it be streaming elsewhere around the world. Reach out into the rooms. Father, I pray you will rebuke the enemy on behalf of those that are sick, on behalf of those that are afflicted, and may we hear the testimony of deliverance and the creative power of Almighty God. And here in the congregation, Father, we're looking for mighty things to take place. Anoint us now, Lord, both speaker and hearers for your glory alone in Jesus name. Amen. &gt;&gt; We certainly give him all the glory. I'll invite you to turn with me to Luke's Gospel the 13th, the 11th chapter. And we're going to begin reading at the fifth verse. And then we'll also turn to First Thessalonians 2 chapter. Luke 11:5. And he said unto them, "Which of you shall have a friend?" And shall say unto him at midnight, and say unto him, "Friend, lend me three loaves. For a friend of mine in his journey is come to me, and I have nothing to set before him." And he from within shall answer and say, "Trouble me not. The door is now shut, and my children are with me in bed. I cannot rise and give thee. I say unto you, though he will not rise and give him because he is his friend, yet because of his importunity, he will rise and give him as much as he has as he needeth. And I say unto you, ask and it shall be given you. &gt;&gt; Seek and you shall find. Knock and it shall be opened unto you. For everyone that askketh receiveth, and he that seeketh findeth, and to him that knockketh it shall be opened. &gt;&gt; If a son shall ask bread of of you, that is a father, will you give him a stone? Or if he ask a fish, will he give uh for a fish, give him a serpent? Or if he shall ask an egg, will he offer him a scorpion? If ye then, being evil, know how to give good gifts unto your children, how much more shall your heavenly father give the Holy Spirit to them that ask him? &gt;&gt; How much more, &gt;&gt; hallelujah, shall he give the Holy Spirit, not something else, but the Holy Spirit? &gt;&gt; I will read also in first Thessalonians the 2 chapter. We'll start at verse 7. But we were gentle among you, the Apostle Paul writing, even as a nurse cherisheth cherisheth her children. So being affectionately desirous of you, we were willing to have imparted unto you not the gospel of God only, but also our own souls, because you were dear unto us. For you remember, brethren, our labor and travail, for laboring night and day, because we would not be chargeable unto any of you. We preached unto you the gospel of God. You are witnesses, and God also, how holy and justly and unblamably we behaved ourselves among you that believe. as you also as you know how we exhorted and comforted and charged every one of you as a father doth his children that you would walk worthy of God who hath called you unto his kingdom and glory. Notice please verse 13. For this cause also, thank we God, without ceasing, because when you received the word of God, which you heard of us, you received it not as the word of men, &gt;&gt; but as it is in truth, the word of God, &gt;&gt; which effectively workketh also in you that believe. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; When you receive the word of God, and I'm speaking the second part on receiving him. When you receive the word of God, they could have said, "Well, that's just apostles. That's Apostle Paul's idea, or he was taught under Galius. This is some hangover from Gal or this is something from the Sanhedrin." But when these people who were from Thessalonica heard heard Paul, you received the word of God, which you heard of us. And you received it not as the word of man, but as it is in truth, the word of God, which effectively workketh also in you that believe. It would not have worked effectively if they had received it as the word of man. But as they received it as the word of God, then it worked effectively. That's the automatic reaction to the person who's receiving it. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. God bless you. You may be seated. You may want to take some notes. If you have a question, it's fine. Put it down. I'd like you to I'd like to God will help me to give more of a study this morning. Last week we had a lot of slides. This week I don't have any but it will need your full attention. I just want to make some statements throughout the service and uh because I'm trying to deal with something that uh I have observed within the message. I'm talking about within the body of believers who hold the message as their faith and uh the revelation of it. It is today as it was when Jesus was here and as as it always has been in the Old Testament as well. But it is that people hear uh and they receive at various levels. I'm just reiterating the beginning of last week. They received Jesus as uh some received him as the son of Joseph and Mary which he was not. So they were wrong even to begin with. &gt;&gt; And obviously could go nowhere with it. &gt;&gt; There were others that received him as a good man, the Bible says, or they received him as a teacher, they received him as a rabbi. Uh and they received him as a prophet, right? &gt;&gt; Uh they wondered who he was. And and even when you start getting to a prophet, they thought that maybe he was John the Baptist that had raised Herod thought that uh they thought that he was u perhaps are you Elias uh or one of the prophets? And Jesus said to the disciples, "Who do men say that I am?" Well, they think that you're maybe one of the prophets uh because they could see that these mighty works and they weren't willing to write the works off, but yet they were not willing to receive the word either. &gt;&gt; And so they had all of these different layers of acceptance &gt;&gt; and recognition. And I want to say something right at the very beginning and please take heed to this. When I will be speaking of the respect and the recognition to a person or to an office that a person occupies, don't think for a moment I am speaking on my behalf or on any individual's behalf because the one that does the recognition, the one that does the respecting, they are the ones that benefit. It's not. For example, I'll just use the home for a moment for a quick example. You that are young people, children, and some of you who are now grown and married and and you have some of that earlier life behind you. The respect the Bible says, "Honor thy father and thy mother that thy days may be prolonged on the earth." Yeah. &gt;&gt; Doesn't say that your parents' days will be prolonged or that they get the benefit. There isn't any benefit that flows to the one that's respected. &gt;&gt; The benefit flows to the one that does the respecting &gt;&gt; in every case. &gt;&gt; And I will come to a quote where the prophet says that you respect the pastor or respect the deacons. It doesn't do anything for them. You're the one that benefits. respect the prophet of God. And so people say, "Well, Brother Brandham was this. He was that, and I'm going to go through it in depth." Well, he was Malachi 4. And fine, he was more than Malachi 4. Oh, well, he was Luke Luke 17:30. Well, he wasn't Luke 17:30, but he revealed Luke 17:30. He revealed he was a son of man revealing the son of man. And then people uh move forward and say, "Well, I know who William Brham is. I was he God's prophet? Absolutely God's prophet. That's wonderful. But you haven't gone far enough. &gt;&gt; He was the vessel that God hid. &gt;&gt; He was the veil of God so that he could reveal Jesus Christ who was the son of God who came out of the bosom of the father. &gt;&gt; And there's something a whole lot more that we have to get uh other than these aren't just my words. I will substantiate these things as we move along. And then Jesus had said, this is one of our texts last week. And he came to his own, and his own received him not, but to as many as received him. To them gave he power to become the sons of God. It wasn't he who was received that got the benefit. &gt;&gt; It was them who received him. They got the power to become the sons of God. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So, please have that established in your mind. The beneficiary is the one that does the respecting, &gt;&gt; the honoring, the one that gets the revelation. &gt;&gt; You're the one &gt;&gt; that benefits from it. And so I want you all to say within your own heart, "Oh God, help me to be in in such a tent of it expectation that I will receive the full measure of what you have for me &gt;&gt; out of your word and by the Holy Spirit." &gt;&gt; I want you to receive it not as the word of man, but as the word of God today over this pullpit. &gt;&gt; I'm not here for my health. I'm not here because I even want to be here. I'd sooner maybe be somewhere else right now. But because of a call of God, because of the burden of the word of the Lord, we're here to to stand at the post of duty. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We're out in not out enjoying the sunshine yesterday. Just after many hours of just waiting on God, Friday the same and and trying to take care of things. So, I don't speak personally. Do not take it that way or you're going to miss the entire service. The beneficiary is the one that does the that that checks the office. For example, I'll just use it on a natural level. Whether it be the prime minister of Canada, the premier of the province, uh uh the president of the United States, you may not agree with the man, but his office demands respect. &gt;&gt; The Bible speaks of those that are in authority. They're they're they're just men of the world. They say the Bible says he doesn't carry the sword in vain. He's an officer on the street. Perhaps he's a police officer or whatever more. You may not agree with them. They they they may have their bad side and all the rest of it. That's not that's not the point. The point is that the office requires some respect. &gt;&gt; The mother father requires respect. The Bible teaches that you that are laboring for someone who's an employer, you respect him as an you may not agree with him. You may not even agree with some of his tactics or whatever more. You may not he said you may say, "Well, he's an unbeliever." So, that may be so. But that's why the Bible even says we pray for our leaders. We pray we pray for We may not agree with the system. &gt;&gt; That's not the point. We are a beneficiary because God has simply said it. And so much more so we agree and uh respect the offices that God has established for the body of Jesus Christ. We respect those. We're required to respect it. It's not an option. We're required to expect it. Respect it. And if people don't, then they are the ones who who really suffer as a result of it. Amen. &gt;&gt; So when he received the word, he received it not as the word of man, but as it is in truth, the word of God. &gt;&gt; And God does reveal himself in different forms. He reveals himself, don't ask me why. I can't explain it, but he reveals himself at different levels. He reveals and has hid himself. He's been veiled behind badger skins. He was veiled in the in the Old Testament behind the the in in the tabernacle and uh that's just the way God does things that but he remains the same as the prophet said God is in his nature. God is in his universe. &gt;&gt; Uh God is in his son. God is in his word &gt;&gt; and God is in his people. &gt;&gt; Now that's not to be diluted. As we go through, we look at nature, we say, "Oh, yes, God's in nature. That God's in his people. &gt;&gt; That God is present here this morning." &gt;&gt; And don't water it down. Say, "Well, God's in creation. I see the glory. I see the power. I see the magnificent." That magnificent God's in his people. &gt;&gt; In no less measure, in fact, is in a greater measure. He's not giving eternal life to, you know, just things in nature, but he's giving eternal life to his children, to his family. &gt;&gt; God has hid himself behind veils in the unveiling of God. He said he's he he always was veiled. Veiled in his church &gt;&gt; with skin on him. &gt;&gt; He was in his human temple, veiled in a human being. &gt;&gt; That's always the way that he's been. &gt;&gt; He was in his prophets. Amen. &gt;&gt; He has revealed himself. They weren't exactly prophets. Listen, they weren't exactly prophets. They were gods. &gt;&gt; With a small G. They were gods. He said so. For what they spoke was God's word. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; They were the flesh that God was veiled in. &gt;&gt; I like that. &gt;&gt; They were the flesh that God was veiled in. &gt;&gt; Does this church acknowledge that &gt;&gt; you do you receive him at that level? The prophet was the veil, but the word was God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; If you accept that, you will benefit today. &gt;&gt; There's perhaps another level you can take it to today. &gt;&gt; He said he never changed his nature, only his form. Hebrews 13:8, he's the same yesterday, today, and forever. Like I change from husband, brother Brandham says like I change from husband when my child is born. Then I am father. When my grandchild is born, I'm grandfather. &gt;&gt; But I don't change. It's still me. &gt;&gt; That's God. &gt;&gt; It's just I change my form. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Says another place. But it's the same person &gt;&gt; all the time. The same person. &gt;&gt; God all the time. In this way he reveals himself to his people in doing this &gt;&gt; in changing his form. But this is the mystery of it. This is why uh you know the world is so given over to its knowledge and to what its its its ability to learn and wisdom. The wisdom of the world is foolishness to God. &gt;&gt; Always has been. Still is. The world talks about Socrates, but the Bible doesn't talk about Socrates or Plato or any of these philosophers. &gt;&gt; Doesn't talk about them because they don't have any place in God's economy. &gt;&gt; God, when he came, he came and he veiled himself in in a a poor language, the Galilean language, a gutal language that was short of perhaps words and expressions. He veiled himself. He veiled himself by being with the poor people, not the sophisticated people, by being with the poor people. That's part of his veil. &gt;&gt; He veiled himself by uh by being humble and being with in humility. &gt;&gt; He h he he veiled himself that way. And he's still the same. &gt;&gt; He wants to do exactly the same. God may give you nicer clothes or a nicer home or nicer. Don't forget God has nothing to do with that. That just may be part of his blessings. But the real the real test is that God remains the same in his nature. &gt;&gt; God loves simplicity. &gt;&gt; God loves honesty. God loves integrity. God loves purity. &gt;&gt; That God will never change. Amen. &gt;&gt; Let's be friends &gt;&gt; and realize that this is the God that we we serve. &gt;&gt; He speaks in a simple language. &gt;&gt; Jesus said, brother Brown, I'm quoting him. He hid it from the eyes of the wise and the prudent and revealed it unto babes such as would learn. So receiving him at the depth, at the depth of respect, at the depth of reverence, at the depth of honor, and to cherish what is acceptable with God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You know, we should be lovers of those things that God loves. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Receiving him to whip. The Bible says that God was in Christ reconciling the world to himself. But Jesus Christ was not popular. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Preach it. &gt;&gt; He was not the popular person we think and that that the world, the Christian world so-called, has made him to be. &gt;&gt; And beautiful crosses. The cross isn't beautiful. &gt;&gt; The cross was bloody. The pro the cross was a a a vicious place. &gt;&gt; The cross is an emblem of sorrow and shame. That's where bad men hung. &gt;&gt; We don't have a nice cross here &gt;&gt; on the wall. And if we did, I wouldn't want it to be that nice. &gt;&gt; I don't want to be identified with something that's been refined &gt;&gt; to that point. Amen. &gt;&gt; God gives a good building or gives a good school or gives us whatever whatever or good equipment and and men that can run it. Wonderful. Only wonderful for one point to get this same message further out into somebody else's heart. &gt;&gt; And if it doesn't get in somebody else's heart, I'm not interested in it. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. The vision remains the same. Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; The commission remains the same. going into all the world and preach the gospel of Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; We don't care whether it's refined or not. That's not the point. Just get it out. &gt;&gt; I'm not interested in how beautiful the spoken word books are. If they're nice, we like to do things nice. We like to have it in good quality. But but however it gets there, get the word out. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; If you can't preach, you can tell how the candle got lit. Tell somebody. Amen. &gt;&gt; Don't know why I'm on that subject. &gt;&gt; So God was in his prophet when when the woman, the Shunomite woman, and Elijah said to Gahhesi, Gahhesi, his his servant, take my staff and go and lay it upon the baby. Brother Brandham says, "And God has a provided lamb. Take this staff and go and lay it on the baby." This woman was had she was being uh you know she had impertunity as well. She was being persistent. That's what the one who came to the door and I'll come back to that. She was being persistent. Take my staff laid on the baby. He said he knew everything he touched was blessed. &gt;&gt; And so you remember he said Paul didn't pray over the handkerchiefs. He took them off of his body. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; That was the prophet's faith. Amen. &gt;&gt; So you see, he said, "Take my staff, and if anybody salutes you, don't salute back. Lay it on the baby." But the woman's faith wasn't in the staff. It was in the prophet. &gt;&gt; Her faith wasn't in what the man touched. &gt;&gt; Her faith wasn't even in the man. But she recognized she was he had the word of God. &gt;&gt; He had the word of life. &gt;&gt; So her faith wasn't in the staff. It was in the prophet and she said, "I'll not leave. As surely as your soul lives, I'm not going to leave you." &gt;&gt; That's what gave life to her child. &gt;&gt; Amen. When Jesus was here, the very upright and people who they couldn't lay your finger on, scribes, Pharisees, and so on. And they said, "If we had been in the days of our fathers, we would not have been partakers with them in the blood of the prophets." Nothing really changes. Wherefore, Jesus said, "Wherefore, ye be witnesses unto yourselves that you are the children of them that killed the prophets." Nothing's changed. You You're upholding the same thing your fathers upheld. &gt;&gt; And why did they kill the prophets? Because they didn't receive them. &gt;&gt; The prophets, the prophets weren't damaged &gt;&gt; when the people didn't receive them. The prophets weren't even damaged when they got killed. &gt;&gt; Right. Right. &gt;&gt; But what did it do for those that did the did the rejecting? It heaped condemnation upon them. &gt;&gt; They were the recipients of their own rejection. So you need to be so careful &gt;&gt; and we are so careful that we abide and stay with the program of God. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; God in the form, fire in the bush, a light, a dove, a lamb, a man, the Holy Spirit, the pillar of fire, a human being, Christ in the word. It is nigh unto impossible, and I'm careful with I'm being selective with my words, but it's nigh unto impossible to give due honor and respect and worship to the very person of Jesus Christ. Unless the Holy Spirit reveals him to us &gt;&gt; in the form that God has chosen to show himself in that particular time. &gt;&gt; Amen. In modern events made clear Jesus when he come he was a prophet and today before Jesus comes again the full manifestation of the person &gt;&gt; of the person of Jesus Christ is manifested in flesh &gt;&gt; how do we how do we give sufficient recognition and response and and reverence to the word. We say the message be careful folks &gt;&gt; be careful &gt;&gt; if we really really in depth &gt;&gt; and we say it's revealed to us that's the word of God in that vessel how casually are we taking that how casually do we deal that deal with that like I've said and I don't hesitate saying it the message is not background music. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; I'll turn it on and you know just hear it and around the house. That's fine. &gt;&gt; But make sure you take quality time &gt;&gt; and sit down &gt;&gt; and hear &gt;&gt; what God delivered &gt;&gt; to this generation. &gt;&gt; And today before Jesus comes again, the full manifestation of the person of Jesus Christ is to be manifested in flesh. He said, "Think of it." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Jesus said, "As it was in the days of Sodom, so shall it be in the coming of the Son of Man. When the Son of Man is being revealed, uh what is revealed, unfolded, made known, the secret had been brought forth, revealed." &gt;&gt; And listen friends, the you know, we have seven seals, the seven seals have been open, etc., etc. The book uh the seven seals, that book's not another book. That book is a secret &gt;&gt; that was in God's mind &gt;&gt; and you have the privilege &gt;&gt; of actually seeing what was in God's mind &gt;&gt; in Christ is the mystery of God revealed. Brother Brandham says what was way in the back of God's mind. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Way in the back of God's mind. And I want to just give you something simple which I've spoken here many times but I'm putting it I'm really laying it in your lap. A prophet stands here and perhaps a woman stands there and he says you were you were uh before two doctors. They're rather large men. You were before them. That's yesterday or last week. He she was before them. And he says I hear them speaking. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Where's he? Amen. &gt;&gt; She they she was there some days ago in an office in another building maybe in another town. Here's a man standing here. What kind of vessel is that? I hear them speaking and tells her what they said. &gt;&gt; And then tells her what will be. &gt;&gt; If God knows what was &gt;&gt; and I this is my comment. If he can go back yesterday or last week, can he not go back a hundred years or a thousand years or millennia into the mind of God? &gt;&gt; Way back before there was a blade of grass, &gt;&gt; before any human drew breath, &gt;&gt; before there was a creation &gt;&gt; and bring it down to you. That's the seals. Amen. &gt;&gt; Sure. In the seals, it sure speaks about say the Roman Catholic Church cuz he knew it would be here. He knew it would be here in its refinement, in its glory, and all of its sophistication. And he knew that Satan would put his uh put his nest himself there, put his throne there &gt;&gt; and and have its control over the peoples of the earth. And God is demonstrating and showing how he hates that thing. And way before the foundation of the earth, he already called her a harlot. &gt;&gt; You call her the great harlot. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Give the wind a mighty voice. Let this sound go. &gt;&gt; Let the internet hear it. Let every people who heard it receive it. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. God knew she was a harlot. God knew she was unfaithful. &gt;&gt; And that man would sit there and all the pump and all the glory, all of it's man's glory. Yes, &gt;&gt; this church ought to be in full agreement with that. I tell you what, &gt;&gt; that's a cursed system. &gt;&gt; And God's going to cast her in a fire, lake of fire. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. So, we have receiving by hearing of the ear &gt;&gt; and then receiving by appropriating. If you hear something today friends, you and you say that is true. I accept that. Brother Bisco, preach it. I accept that. &gt;&gt; Then you're duty bound to go out of these doors and appropriate what you heard. &gt;&gt; Say that's what the word says. That's what the vindicated message says. And I'm going out of here and doing it. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. It's not a lot of legalism. It doesn't have nothing to do with legalism. &gt;&gt; That's a word that man has invented. Has nothing to do with legalism. It has to do with we finally see who he is. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Like a young man, young woman coming to get married and will you be true? Will you be faithful to this man, this woman alone as long as you both shall live? It's a commitment. &gt;&gt; It don't say, "Oh man, that's a whole bunch of legalism." you. Nobody talks about legalism. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; I read a a little note. I sent it to my wife that uh somebody said, and I I I I'm glad I don't have his kind of marriage, but he said that the wedding rings were the smallest handcuffs in the world. If you feel that way, if you're truly married on a love basis, you don't consider them handcuffs. I've never thought that this was a handcuff, dear. Do you Did you put handcuffs on me? &gt;&gt; It's not handcuffs. &gt;&gt; It's not some bondage. &gt;&gt; It's a love affair. &gt;&gt; Amen. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; For this cause also, Paul, I'm repeating this scripture. Uh we thank God without ceasing. &gt;&gt; We thank God without ceasing. Paul was filled with thanksgiving because when you heard the word, when you heard the word, when you received it, the word of God which you heard of us, &gt;&gt; you received it. Not as two different words. When you received it, as I showed last week on the on the screen, paralambo, when you received the word of God that you heard from us, you received it not as the word of men, but as it is the word of God. &gt;&gt; Those people took that and said, "We've heard the word of God." &gt;&gt; Think what would happen if we walked out of here today and I just say, "God, God's the one that can sort it out." But if we walked out of here today and said, "We've quoted from the messenger. We've quoted uh and stayed with that word just as close as we know how." Some might say, "Well, there's a whole lot of quotes." That's the level your benefit will come. &gt;&gt; I could read all the Bible. And someone could say, "Well, I can go home and read all of that." All he did was read scripture. &gt;&gt; Uh all he did was give some quotes. I can go home and read those quotes. But when the Holy Spirit says, "Say it this way. &gt;&gt; Put it this way and structure it in this order." That's the way he wants it to come into your mind and into your heart. &gt;&gt; And if you hear it, it'll produce faith. &gt;&gt; Don't tell me you don't need faith. Everybody in here needs faith at some level. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; This is still a God who cast the all of the galaxies out in space. that God can work on your behalf &gt;&gt; on my behalf. And we have something we need him to do. Let's receive the word as it is the word of God indeed. &gt;&gt; And you can have what you ask. &gt;&gt; That's what Jesus was preaching. That's what he was saying. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. All right. I There's a big difference between receiving the word as it is the word of man or receiving it as it is indeed the word of God. Receiving the word as it is in truth, the word of God. receiving this Christ, receiving this message at a different level. And now I just come to this scripture and this person and Jesus is saying, "Which of you shall have a friend?" There's friends and then there's friends. And sometimes we find that a friend uh was a friend for a certain period of time. Uh I know of marriages that have come apart and uh the partners say, "Well, we're we're the best of friends." Well, I don't understand that, but it means something to them. I guess they have some they interpreted, we have some association. We're the best of friends or we still have remained as friends. And Jesus said, "Which of you shall have a friend?" I'd like you to notice how this is used. And shall go unto him at midnight. He said, "Well, I'm I have a friend." And now this friend said, "A friend of mine has come." &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; So now this one is here at this at her friend's door and what do you want? It's midnight. I need three loaves of bread. Uh don't trouble me. I I'm in bed and the door's locked and my children are in bed and they just keep pounding because they says a friend of mine &gt;&gt; came. So when that friend of theirs came, they got up. &gt;&gt; They got dressed. &gt;&gt; They went down the road to their friend's place. &gt;&gt; And so they all got a different understanding what friendship is. &gt;&gt; I got a friend to come to my door and I don't have anything to offer them. So, I've come to you because you're my friend. &gt;&gt; And this friend says, "No, you know, just leave me alone. I'm in bed and the door's closed and everything is everything's the way it should be." But they kept pounding. And Jesus is saying here, I say unto you, though he will not rise and give him because of that he is a friend. So he didn't rise and give him and respond to this need because of friendship. Said he will not rise and give him uh because he's a friend yet because of his importunity &gt;&gt; because of his importunity. And that importunity is a you know a a persistent annoying &gt;&gt; aggravating almost. It's someone that can get on your nerves &gt;&gt; because you just prevail. &gt;&gt; You cannot deny me. &gt;&gt; I am your friend. &gt;&gt; What do you say? Oh, father God, I'm coming and I am your son. &gt;&gt; The prodal son knew and he came home. He said, "My father's servants are better off than me in this pig pen. I'm going to return back to my father, &gt;&gt; my father, because he even treats his servants better than I'm being treated. And I will say to my father, I've sinned against you, but I'm coming home and make me as one of your hired servants. But that father, he he he had a revelation of the offices. He knew he was father and he knew this was his son. And he knew this son had been a scoundrel and had taken half the estate and blew it &gt;&gt; right &gt;&gt; on a foul living and riotous living. And who knows what he spent it on. &gt;&gt; I wouldn't hardly want to think of what he spent it on. He spent it foolishly. And he came home broke. &gt;&gt; And the father had a right to say serves you right. &gt;&gt; I give you half of my estate and you blew the whole works. I worked hard for that. &gt;&gt; But the father had a revelation also. I am the father &gt;&gt; and he is my son &gt;&gt; and his son has come back home. &gt;&gt; I'm not interested in material things. I'm interested in sunship. &gt;&gt; Listen friends, there isn't anybody here. We blew it. &gt;&gt; Sometimes God give us health and we blow the health. He gives us all. He gives us friendship. He gives us spiritual blessings. And sometimes we just blow it. We're you know we're we're just laxidasical about it. He wants to do something and he wants to change us. &gt;&gt; And he comes time after time in a meeting by the Holy Spirit &gt;&gt; and we fail to see it. We fail to grasp who he is. &gt;&gt; Amen. Listen friends, I I'm I'm not saying this for my benefit cuz I don't get the benefit you do. I understand, if I understand the message correctly, a man of God who gives counsel, he may even say not exactly the correct thing, but if you will honor the office, &gt;&gt; if you will honor the office, God will make it come out right for you. &gt;&gt; Not because the council was exactly right, but because your attitude was right. And God responds to your attitude. &gt;&gt; And somehow when it is brought to you, it comes right. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I'm just starting on that. &gt;&gt; Prophet speaks about your approach. Your approach. &gt;&gt; And he takes in believe thou this and then also in other messages perseverant. He takes the approach and one of the people he speaks about at length in different messages is Martha &gt;&gt; and Mary. But Martha and they and Mary had sent word to Jesus, your friend, &gt;&gt; Lazarus &gt;&gt; is sick. &gt;&gt; They weren't coming just to another another person. They were coming to the one that they had given their lives for. They were coming to the one that they had got kicked out of church for. They were no longer accepted by the scribes and the Pharisees and and that's the basis they were. We were coming to you. We've given everything to come to you &gt;&gt; and now your friend is sick &gt;&gt; and he journeys to another city until the friend dies. &gt;&gt; Now put yourself there. &gt;&gt; Don't put yourself up here a couple thousand years. &gt;&gt; Put yourself back then. So, you know what? I called for the ministry. You know what? I called for brother Ed and I wasn't I wasn't all that bad, but this thing has gotten really really things took a big downturn. He never even came by my door. Didn't even come and visit me. Don't tell me you wouldn't have some little feelings. We are just that way. I called for brother. I called for I called for my father. I called for my mom. Now it's going to get real quiet. &gt;&gt; That's just the way I want it. &gt;&gt; God will honor you for your respect. &gt;&gt; To your mother, your father. &gt;&gt; Do you know why? Because it's an office. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; I've gone through this before. I'll go through it again. Maybe some of you haven't been here in the past, but when a child is born in the world, it's a girl. Another child is born in the world, it's a boy. And as they come into the world, they have certain they have certain rights because they have come into the human community. You cannot abuse that child. You cannot do it something that would be a unacceptable in the human community because they have they they're to be fed. We have a catastrophe right now taking place over in Somalia and Ethiopia about 10 people and there's just all kinds of pages of ads and because people the world community, the United Nations, everybody else is wanting to, you know, do everything you can. The Canadian government will match your donation to to feed these people. have sent over $50 million. Hope it gets there. But because the child has rights, but now it becomes a young fellow. He has a right to an education. She has a right to an education. But now they get some responsibilities. Okay, honey. Do I want you to do the dishes and you go out and get some wood or mow the lawn. Now they get a little bit older. When they get about 15, 16 years old, they say, "Hey, Dad, you know, I got my learner's license. What about the car, Brother Alan King? Yeah, thank you, brother Allen. You sent me Sometimes I get this kind of notice. It It helps me out even in preaching. Uh boy came to his dad and he said, "Hey, Dad. Uh I got my driver's license now. Can I get the keys to the car?" He said, 'Well, I've been thinking about that and I'd like you to do a couple of things for me. He said, 'I want you to bring your grades up from B or from C to average B. Bring all your grades up. And number two, I want you to read your Bible. I want you to study it. and take time with your Bible every day. And number three, I want you to get a haircut, he thought for a moment, okay, you have we have a deal. So some weeks went by, help help me to get back to where I was. So, some weeks went by and uh he came to his dad and his dad said, 'You know, son, I I've I've noticed that you've brought your grades up and I've been very pleased with that and you've brought them up to B average. I'm happy with that. And I've noticed that you've been reading your Bible every day and actually giving some quality time and studying your Bible. Uh and he said, "And I'm happy with that." But he says, "You still haven't gotten a haircut." Well, he said, "You know, Dad, that's interesting." He said, "As I was reading the Bible, as I was reading the Bible, uh, it appears that John the Baptist had long hair and the prophets had long hair." And there's good reason to believe that even Jesus had long hair. And uh, his father said, "Uh, well, that's right." He said, "In your studies, did you notice that they all walked as well?" So, they hadn't quite got the full message. See, it's not a matter of, you know, exactly what's being said. It's a matter of who is saying it. &gt;&gt; The office of the father or mother is absolutely so significant. And uh it is this acknowledgement. Then you see these young couples or young men, young woman. And then they become beyond that. And young man, young woman see have eyes for each other and say, you know, I think I like this person. Sometime they come to me and say, I think that I have a liking for this person. I I said I always ask, do you think it's mutual? Uh, yeah, I think so. Uh, what makes you think that? Well, I was walking through the foyer and I happened to see her looking at me. Oh, that's that's really supernatural. So, uh, so anyway, we go on from there. But let's just say that finally it does come around to be uh uh an engagement. Now, now they become you know engaged or betrothed to one another and that becomes very serious because they are approaching into an office and then they become married and that's why it's such a sacred thing because now he becomes a husband and she becomes a wife and those are offices. They have now entered into offices that God has ordained. And then that office becomes compounded. Then comes life and children come and she becomes a mother. You ought to read what the Bible says about mothers and he becomes a father. He becomes a provider. He enters into an office. And God requires that office be regarded and and respected. And that is why here comes Elijah the prophet and he speaks on church order. &gt;&gt; He speaks on the position of of of of the deacons and the five-fold ministry and the trustees. He lays it out because they're offices. &gt;&gt; He's not he's not trying to say something glamorous about the men. Right. &gt;&gt; And when he spoke about it and he was telling about uh the the vessel that the prophets avail and and he he describes it that uh this messenger of of of revelation uh 3 and 14 and this revelation of revelation 10 and he describes that and that revelation 10:1 is Christ. it is Christ and 10:7 is to reveal him &gt;&gt; and he is the fulfillment of 17 uh uh Luke 17 and 30 and he puts and then he says and don't think that I'm speaking about myself &gt;&gt; then I'll I'll show you places where he said I'm no prophet &gt;&gt; why was he saying that because he was actually he was indeed a prophet revealing what was in the man's heart who had approached him because the man didn't believe he was a prophet. &gt;&gt; So, he simply said what was in his heart. I'm no prophet. &gt;&gt; Said it several times. Now, how do you get that? And then yet, on the other hand, bring it right down to such a fine line that people even have a hard time separating a son of man revealing the son of man and God himself veiled behind the skin and in the flesh and revealed again in a human being. All of that is absolutely the truth. And I received those words not as a word of a man, but as indeed it is the word of God. &gt;&gt; When did you ever receive? Hey, you young people, you got Google and do all your all your uh uh research in history. Find me another ministry like that. And when you do, come and show me. Come and tell me about it. Find another ministry in history. You can go through all the philosophers and all the great men and all the mediums and whatever more. You'll never find another ministry like that. I haven't been able to find it. And the reason I say you won't because the Bible doesn't speak of another one. &gt;&gt; The Bible says there'll be this one. &gt;&gt; When you got Vancouver and Tel Aviv and San Francisco and all the places in the world with their gay parades, I tell you what a sight of uncleanness. What an age we're living in. &gt;&gt; I'm amazed God hasn't already destroyed this world. &gt;&gt; And we're here for a purpose &gt;&gt; to live in this unclean world, dark world as a light. And you only have light because the revealed word of God is light. &gt;&gt; Help me out. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And the same principles apply. The same identical principles apply as we find them in the in the scripture and in the scripture which we read. this friend coming to another friend and and brother Brandham taking that and and speaking about Martha and this is what she said and and he was referring to Elijah for a moment and she wouldn't she wouldn't uh accept Elijah or Elijah coming and but but then he switches right away and he comes to uh uh to Martha he said if God was in Elijah surely he was in his son this is in Martha's thinking now if he's in his in is Elijah. He's certainly in his son. And she knew if she could get to him, she could find why her brother died. He now he'd already died. She'd asked him to come. I want every person in this congregation to put yourself back there to see where you are here today. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Does that make sense? &gt;&gt; Put yourself back there to see where you are today. &gt;&gt; Now, your loved one has died and he didn't come. He even went to another city and waited and didn't come. But your your heart is saying if God was in Elijah and I'm confident that this is his son. She uh and she pushed on by them critics. She had lots of people around coming to bewail the death of her brother, but she pushed by the critics and went right on out. And Jesus hadn't got to town yet. And she got to where he was. &gt;&gt; And now watch. He said, look like she had a right to upgrade him. &gt;&gt; Looked like she had a right to scold him and say, "Why didn't you come?" &gt;&gt; See, that would have been an attitude of a average person perhaps. And I pray it wouldn't be anyone here that would have that kind of attitude. And oh, I thought you could heal. If she would have if she would, the miracle would never have taken place. &gt;&gt; So often, friends, I'm going to bear right down. So often things that we want to have happen so deeply don't happen because our approach to the office of God is incorrect. Our approach to the messenger that brought this message is not right. Our approach to one another isn't right. Our approach to husbands and wives needs to be corrected. And the scripture, this scripture you love says that Sarah called her husband Lord &gt;&gt; not because she thought he was perhaps extra especially spiritual but it was his office &gt;&gt; and she was approaching his office. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Yes, he lied but it was still Abraham. Yes, the prophet said he backslid and went to Gar, but he was still Abraham. &gt;&gt; Nothing would change that he was Abraham. &gt;&gt; Listen, the gift and calling are without repentance. You were born who you are, &gt;&gt; and you've been given the gift of God, and God will never repent over that. &gt;&gt; Do you believe that? Amen. &gt;&gt; People who are ministers, I say ministers, ministers indeed. If you talk to them as I have talked to them, that's the last thing in the world they want. They don't want to be behind the pullpit. They don't want to spend their day studying. They don't want to spend their life serving. They don't want to do all the counseling and hearing of the, you know, the trouble and the woes and try to fix things. And the burden bearer, they don't want to bear the burdens. You understand that? And people have said to me kind of smiling, "Well, you're a burden bearer. you know, the the ox of the team, you're a burden bearer. That's not what I want to hear. I tell my wife, if I only had my burdens in this life, it'd be a cakewalk. &gt;&gt; It'd be simple. I only have to worry about, you know, earning enough to keep family and soul and skin together. That'd be fine. That's not the thing. And so, it's it's it's an office. And people approach an office. &gt;&gt; That's exactly what it is, friends. It's an office. and the wife is an office. &gt;&gt; You children when you go to your mom and brother Bar Brown said one of the things he hates to hear somebody calling their mother and father the old man and the old woman. &gt;&gt; He said and then God calls them off the scene &gt;&gt; and you and you see them wheel them out of the out of the room head first. You'll find out. He said that was your best friend on earth. &gt;&gt; You young people ought to say amen. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; Amen. I was a fairly young man and I held I held my dad's hand right here in the Vancouver General Hospital. This house that we were just building here 40 years ago, by the way, was a young church and I had this lot. Anyway, I won't go into a lot of detail, but we were building it and I talked to my dad the night before and said uh he was going to come and help me to lay some weeping tile around the basement. And so he was going to come, he was going to try and get my brother-in-law to come and it didn't work out. And so I said, "Okay." I said, "Why don't you come over early and we'll have breakfast and then just go on up to the site." Okay, that was the plan. Okay, Dad. I'll see you in the morning. That was my last words. I just wasn't I didn't know which morning it was. &gt;&gt; I'll see you in the morning. &gt;&gt; And in the morning, he didn't come. He didn't come for breakfast. So, I thought, well, he's got tied up. He's trying to find my brother-in-law and so and so. Anyway, I went up here just over here on 180th. And I'm there and my wife drives up in the station wagon and she I can see a strange look on her face and she said, "Ed, I think you better come. Your dad's been taken to the hospital in an ambulance. Oh. I said, "What happened?" Said, "I don't know. The woman in in the house that lives upstairs said she found him laying on the floor." Oh, I said, "He must have hit his head. He must have fell and hit his head." I just I couldn't accept. My dad and I were taken like brothers. We He was so youthful. And anyway, in a hour or so, they said, "Well, you better get his health record and get down to the hospital." And I went down, walked into the emergency, met one of the doctors, and I said, "Uh, I'm I'm Ed Biscll, Fred Biscll's son." He said, "Well, I I said, "What happened?" He said, "I think he's had a massive cerebral hemorrhage." What? And I walked in behind the curtain and they shaved part of my dad's head and he had aged 20 years from last night to this morning. He just aged 20 years. and he was in a deep unconscious state and I took and I held his hand and uh God began to deal with me and let me know that he was going and I I I refused it. I just refused it. I just could not accept it. He's he's strong. He's health. He's never hardly been sick. And one time then I had one day I just had to hold his hand and I said, "God, I don't know where dad is. Uh, I know from the message that they're here by their senses. They see, they hear, they smell, they taste, they feel. And he hasn't got those senses. All he's doing laying here breathing, breathing strong. His chest just billowing out, you know, such a strong man. And I said, he's not here. I don't know where he is. If you could bring him, I'm believing that he'll raise up. he has to raise up. But 6 days they operated and um said he'll probably just last a short time and he did just another few days and slipped away and I didn't get a chance to talk to my father who was my best friend. He really was my best friend. And the prophet said, "Someday, and if time goes on, you'll remember this service and these words, somebody that's very close to you and somebody you love. You'll see them wheel them out, like you said, head first." And you'll attend a funeral. You say, "Well, I didn't get a chance to say what I wanted to say. I didn't I didn't have an opportunity." Part of my service today is that we need to respect with a godly respect the offices. God, listen to me. God will never change his mind about that office. &gt;&gt; You young people, you were born from the womb of your mother because God knew that before the foundation of the world. And that mother can never change that. And she is in that office. that father, the seed come from father. And that and that is and and if I could convey to you, you that have children that are not born again, you have a holy right before God, God Almighty, you gave me those children, predestination or no predestination, I believe it all. I believe everything this prophet said, but I also believe what he said. Ask what you will. and it shall be done. &gt;&gt; That's why I'm preaching today. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Not something for 2,000 years ago or 2,000 years hence, but for today now you can anchor that in your heart. I hold that before God. I hold that before God. Ask. &gt;&gt; And that's what the scripture was about. The man came and asked, you're my friend. We're not just Jesus said, "I I I now call you friends because I've told you everything the father has told me." I'll tell you what, friends. We went way beyond that in this prophet's in this prophet's ministry. &gt;&gt; He was the forerunner &gt;&gt; and the bridegroom himself &gt;&gt; veiled himself in that skin &gt;&gt; to tell you your position with him. &gt;&gt; You are my bride. I've elected you. I came and called you. &gt;&gt; This is my voice &gt;&gt; coming through this messenger. Do you accept that folks here? &gt;&gt; Do you accept that up in the balcony? &gt;&gt; Do you accept that up here? &gt;&gt; Do you accept that, friends? &gt;&gt; It was God veiled. God veiled in skin &gt;&gt; to tell us it's wedding time. &gt;&gt; I'm inviting you to a wedding. our wedding &gt;&gt; and we stumbled along and finally we wake up and say, "Oh, I'm amazed that he loves me." Well, friends, with everything that's been said, we should have discovered a long time ago that he's bringing us into a possession, into an office, &gt;&gt; not just as a bride, but as a wife. And the prophet of God goes to Ruth in the Old Testament. Ruth who had been a who had been whatever she had been a boite and found herself in the field like you have maybe found yourself. You're here today. Listen to me. And you find yourself in this field of &gt;&gt; Boaz. &gt;&gt; And remember when she was in the field of Boaz, she was still picking up little just little bits and surviving. Maybe that's where you're at today, but that's not where he wants you. He wants you to realize he's the mighty man of wealth. &gt;&gt; He wants you to realize that's his field. &gt;&gt; And he set his eyes on you. &gt;&gt; And he spoke to his servant said, "Who is this woman? &gt;&gt; And she's the maiden. &gt;&gt; She's the Moabitete. She wasn't born right. Neither were you. &gt;&gt; We're not born right. We didn't come into this world maybe the right way, &gt;&gt; but he's here &gt;&gt; to give you a new birth. &gt;&gt; He's here to buy you &gt;&gt; and you'll be his. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And then she wasn't interested in just getting some gifts. I'm talking about receiving him. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Give me a few more minutes. Once you receive him, if anybody receives their husband and is only interested in what he can give her, it's not in for a good, it's in for a rocky relationship. &gt;&gt; We're not in for what we can get out of this marriage. &gt;&gt; And get, you know, get something to, you know, tickle ourselves with. She got him the person. &gt;&gt; She received him the person. &gt;&gt; Listen to me, friends. Don't just receive a message. received a person &gt;&gt; of Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; He's in the message. &gt;&gt; The message is what he's &gt;&gt; is the message he's conveying to us. He's talking about Am I making it clear? &gt;&gt; Am I making it clear? &gt;&gt; He's a person. &gt;&gt; Every once in a while there's books that are written and the author becomes a great person and then they'll put an ad in the paper and people who have read the book, "Oh, I've just read that book. I'm so excited about that book. And they say, "Well, the author's going to be downtown in a bookstore." They'll be at Chapters or uh Nobles bookstore and and they'll be be down there and and signing and people flock up there and line up because they want to meet the author. &gt;&gt; Oh, you're the person you're the person that this is written about. This is your story. and they sign it. &gt;&gt; Well, I Jesus &gt;&gt; have sent mine angel. &gt;&gt; I Jesus &gt;&gt; have written this book. &gt;&gt; I Jesus, &gt;&gt; he is the He is the husband. &gt;&gt; He's the one that's taking you on a honeymoon. Listen, friends, this isn't some pie in the sky. This is reality. You're sitting in a pew today, but you're going to sit on a chair &gt;&gt; in a bride's in a supper, a wedding supper. You're going to sit there. &gt;&gt; You're going to sit beside another one. &gt;&gt; Might be one you're sitting beside now or might be someone different, but they will be bloodbought. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Came into this world for one purpose, &gt;&gt; to be a son of God or a daughter of God. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Some of you don't have uh Christian parents. Some of you have Christian parents. That's not an accident if you're born in a Christian home. That was ordained by God &gt;&gt; to make you a family unit like that. &gt;&gt; That's a special unit. &gt;&gt; Special offices, &gt;&gt; honorable, wonderful. &gt;&gt; And maybe you didn't have that. Maybe you, you know, had a different kind of a background. I don't care what background you have. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I don't care what the background is. God ordained &gt;&gt; and sent this word. &gt;&gt; And if you haven't heard it before, you're hearing it this morning. &gt;&gt; This is God's This is God's call &gt;&gt; to this people. I feel very much urged &gt;&gt; I feel very much commissioned &gt;&gt; of God to say certain things &gt;&gt; and I even wondered as I was uh studying and giving myself to it. This congregation needs to receive this at a different level. &gt;&gt; Not down here. We're not just a group of people to fellowship. That's not what it's about. We're not here just to fellowship. We're here because each of us have received the bridegroom. &gt;&gt; We've received him as our husband. And nothing can change that &gt;&gt; ever. &gt;&gt; I don't care whether you understand it. &gt;&gt; You that are Americans, do you understand everything that's happening in the White House right now? Do you understand everything about the national debt? Do you understand everything about the gold reserve or the or the Fed the Feds? Do you understand that? No, you don't understand it. But you're still Americans, &gt;&gt; are you not? &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. That wasn't a very strong name. Amen. How many Americans have we got? Oh my goodness. Half the congregation. &gt;&gt; Do you understand everything was in happening in the in the White House? Do you understand it all? Do you understand perhaps the laws and all the negotiations going on right now? Raise your hands. You understand it all. Thank you. We got one. He's a hero. Brother Jim Weber. He understands it. Well, I'll tell you what. I understand quite a bit of it. even being a Canadian. And I understand it cuz a cuz a prophet came along told me they were broke. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; About 50 years ago told me they were broke. &gt;&gt; And you that are grandchildren, you that were just babies years and years ago, he he said that you're going to be paying off your grandparents debt. Amen. &gt;&gt; All you need to do is get about 14 plus trillion dollars and divide it by 330 million and you find out how much each of you owe. &gt;&gt; Do you know what happened in Canada? I don't know what happened. I don't even know the laws they passed last week. They passed laws. I don't know what they are. Does that change my position? No. I'm still a Canadian. &gt;&gt; Proud of it or sad about it or whatever. You're still you are what you are. You're German, you're French, you're Russian, you're something else, you're Ukrainian, African, whatever it is, God knew that before the before time began. &gt;&gt; He saw you coming. &gt;&gt; And what you have to settle in your heart, God had me coming here cuz he want me exactly as I am &gt;&gt; and I'm here for his glory. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And when you respect that, and listen, this is probably a final one. I've got to close, but I I could go on for, you know, another hour or two. I got so much on my plate, &gt;&gt; but one of the people you have to respect is yourself. Amen. &gt;&gt; You have to respect the fact that God called you, &gt;&gt; that God thought enough of you to hunt you down &gt;&gt; to find you where you were &gt;&gt; and then to send his spirit to you &gt;&gt; and begin to move over you &gt;&gt; and begin to break you down until you said yes &gt;&gt; and begin to illuminate your mind till it was a revelation. &gt;&gt; And you have to respect that. Amen. &gt;&gt; You know, one of the hardest things I have to have respect. Yesterday afternoon, yesterday all day, beautiful day. I had to respect the office &gt;&gt; of a minister, a minister's responsibility. Sit at your desk. &gt;&gt; Wait on God. &gt;&gt; Read these scriptures. See what God's messenger said. See what my prophet said. Hear what he said. Tell the people what he said. That's my responsibility and I have to respect that. &gt;&gt; You have to respect that you're a mother, a father or a young person. You have to respect that. What is my duties? What is my responsibilities? And I touched on it last week. And as husbands, as fathers, we have a responsibility to be godly, &gt;&gt; to give an example, &gt;&gt; to show the children, show the family spiritual leadership, &gt;&gt; integrity. Oh God, just give us more of that. &gt;&gt; I'm so thankful when I see these godly families that have been raised up by the message, cultivated by the message. What a blessing it is. &gt;&gt; What a blessing to have people come around here at this construction and see the young people working and see the fathers and see the sisters working and you young ladies are working, sanding the walls and whatever more. You think you're sanding the walls. God speaking to somebody &gt;&gt; and they come and hear old rough construction men say, "Where in the world do you get like young ladies like that? Where do you get young men like that?" &gt;&gt; Because they're cultivated &gt;&gt; by the word and the message of the hour. And I respect that message. He said, "It's your approach to a divine gift." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; What brings the results? &gt;&gt; It's the way you come to it. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He said another place in perseverance, and I'm closing quickly. Martha, when she went to meet Jesus, if there was anyone that had a right to condemn, it would have been Martha. because she had sent for Jesus to come and pray for her brother. She'd come to him in a dark hour. Come, I need a loaf of bread. I need a healing. My brother is sick unto death. They'd left the church. They'd come out of the old dead movement that they were in and had followed the Lord Jesus believing him to be the anointed Messiah. And then his very friend Lazarus that he come up that he come up with and they'd been excommunicated from their church. Did didn't just leave a church or leave a denomination. They'd been put out, &gt;&gt; cast out. You're not welcome here. &gt;&gt; They've gone through that. &gt;&gt; And now was the hour at midnight. I need you. &gt;&gt; It's desperate. Your friend is sick. Talking about approach, friends. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; And when you go out these doors, if you're going to really receive him, appropriate this word. &gt;&gt; In other words, put it into practice. &gt;&gt; Amen. and his very friend that he came up with was laying sick at the point of death and the doctor could do him no good. And she sent for Jesus and Jesus simply ignored her sending and he went to another city and he did the same thing there and they sent again and he just ignored it and went on. But she ran up to him when he came. She ran up to him and she had a right to upgrade him. She had a right to tell him saying, "Now, why didn't you come when I called you?" And when she got to him, she approached him in the right way &gt;&gt; and she said she give him his title. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; She recognized his office. &gt;&gt; There was people who came around, brother said, "Prophet, prophet, prophet this, prophet that, prophet that." They hadn't received him &gt;&gt; as a prophet of God. &gt;&gt; But there are other people. And she came and she said, "Lord, not upgrade him, but Lord, if thou would have been here, my brother would not have died. Oh my, I can see him pull up his little tired body together." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; If you'd have been here, my brother would not have died. But even now, &gt;&gt; whatever you ask God, &gt;&gt; God will give it to you. &gt;&gt; Amen. And you don't know what that did to me when I was reading that. What a responsibility it puts. &gt;&gt; There's nothing wrong with a child or a young person going to their parent said, "Father, not old man, not just dad." &gt;&gt; Nothing wrong with saying, "Dad, father, you're my father. You're my dad." &gt;&gt; You know God in a different way than I do. I'm a child and the Bible says foolishness is bound in the heart of a child. I've done a lot of foolish things, but I need this God that you have lived in front of me. I need this God that you've talked about. &gt;&gt; I remember one time when Leah, who's here listening, sitting back here now, she has four children. and they had a carpenter remodeling in their house and she was standing on little store steps and with her hands and she was just looking through the railing. So when the workman come up, this carpenter come up, they were just eye to eye and he says, "Where's your dad?" And she just staring absolute blank face. He's talking to Jesus. I guarantee that carpenter never heard that before. &gt;&gt; And he was stunned into silence. To have a child, just a young girl, stare him right in the face that say he's talking to Jesus. That's something kids remember. &gt;&gt; Amen. when my daughter Joanne, who's here, was going through her struggles as a teenager. And it wasn't struggles with the world. It was just little things of character. People have certain strengths. and I sat her down in my study in a chair. That chair is in my office and I won't let anybody recover it because that's where she sat when she was 15. And I said, Joanne, that's where daddy nails and that's where God talks to him. And I said, you need God to do something for you. And she started to break down, which she was standing very, very rigid. But the Holy Spirit, I just sense, not because she was, she didn't weep, she just started to break down. She was resisting it a bit, trying to maintain her composure. And she said, "I've tried. I've tried. I've tried and it doesn't work for her." And I said, Well, I'm going to pray for you. And the next Sunday, I believe it was, and that's the only only message that's ever been printed that I know of that I spoke. And it was sinners die alone. And God laid that on my heart. We're just in the house down here. Maybe 40, 50, 60 people crowded in the house. When I'm getting to the end of that service, sinners die alone. And I spoke on the on the beggar at at the gate of the rich man. And the rich man died. Lazarus died and the angels were there and bore him up into the bosom of Abraham. But the rich man died. There was no angels. There was nobody to receive him. And I got the message, sinners die alone. And I was just in the ending of that message and I was weeping and sobbing while I was preaching and I cried out and I said, "Joanne, it's you. I'm talking about a God that works. &gt;&gt; I'm talking about a God that speaks." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And she came and knelt a chair right then and that's been it. &gt;&gt; That's been it. That's the way it's supposed to be, friends. Yes, &gt;&gt; we'd love to have things perhaps different in other situations, but if we can get a revelation &gt;&gt; of what you are &gt;&gt; and you need to have the respect from almighty God of your own position and what you are and your you that are have husbands and wives to believe and accept them in the light of the scripture as they are. I guarantee you your homes will be different. Your relationships will be different. This church will be different. And we will be what we're supposed to be. Friends, you're going to cross over. I'm going to cross over. &gt;&gt; Listen to me. I come over here and speak to you, young man. I remember so well. It's just gone by like that. I remember being exact. I remember standing and sitting and listening to ministers preach. It's not going to be any time at all. And you're going to be on the other side. We're going to be sitting here right together. You'll be who you are and I'll be who I am. Death changes nothing. &gt;&gt; Is that what he said? Death changes nothing. You say, "Well, this is a different kind of a service." It certainly is a different kind of a service. We're not here just to have church. We're here to get ready to cross over. &gt;&gt; And I need to do absolutely everything I can &gt;&gt; in this life. &gt;&gt; Whether we live a year or 10 years or 50 years, that has nothing to do with it. I that's irrelevant to me. But let us live it according to the word of God in the place that God has given. I say God bless you. &gt;&gt; Young men, young ladies, God bless you. &gt;&gt; Fathers, mothers, God bless you. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. God bless you. &gt;&gt; And God honor you. God will honor you. &gt;&gt; And let's make sure our approach now is a godly approach. &gt;&gt; Amen. like to have brother Derek come and help me with the song if he would please. Now just give me your attention. Brother Brandham said these phrases when he had people. They were there to get something. They were there to get a loaf. They were in their dark hour. But this is what he said. Do you believe me to be God's prophet? Said it 93 times. Do you believe me to be his servant? 102 times. Do you believe me to be do you believe me to be his uh you believe me to be his prophet? You believe me to be his servant? 113 times. Do you believe me to be God's servant? Do you believe me? Do you believe that I am his servant? And there's several hundred times. Why would he say that? Number one, he's having to have respect to his office. &gt;&gt; I am God's prophet. &gt;&gt; I am God's servant. I am his prophet. I am his servant. However he wanted to say it. And he had to say it to them and get a commitment from them. I believe that. &gt;&gt; And he told them clearly, if you believe that, then I can help you. And I have all of those quotes. If you believe that, then I can help you. If you don't believe it, I can't help you. friends, I I'm going to go and talk to Brother Ed. Forget it. &gt;&gt; It won't work. &gt;&gt; Say, "Well, I went and talked to Brother Ed. I went and talked to Brother Tom. I went and talked to Brother John. I went and talked to I I I I talked to my husband. I I I talked We talked it over." Did you? That's great. What was your approach like? &gt;&gt; Said, "Brother Ed, we didn't expect to be squeezed down like this." &gt;&gt; I'm putting the screws to it. This has to This has to change. &gt;&gt; Don't ever come to me as Brother Ed. &gt;&gt; You need to find out what office &gt;&gt; it is. &gt;&gt; Approach the office. If I'm a janitor, then approach me as a janitor. I'll be I'll be honored. &gt;&gt; If I'm a servant of God, then approach me as a servant of God. If I'm your pastor, approach it as that. Whatever. There's a man of God. He's a bearer of the word of God. The Holy Spirit. He gives himself to the Holy Spirit. What kind of honor? You know what the scripture says? Double honor. &gt;&gt; Amen. I've seen it in my own family and I don't want to raise that as an example but that's the only example I've known. I've told you here this I' I've told you here but sometime we come here for healing sometimes it goes in one ear and out the other. I don't want it to go in one ear and out the other. My my wife had an affliction come back on her which was a dangerous affliction and a gynecologist said to her if you ever have this come back on you you contact me immediately and she was good for about 15 years right here while we had this church. We were just getting ready to leave to go to Tacoma and she had her hand on the door knob just to open the door and she took her hand off the knob and she turned and she said, "Honey, that thing has come back on me that I had in Victoria." I said, "When did it happen?" She said, "About 3 weeks ago. And I want you to get the bottle of oil." And we always had the oil on the window sill. I want you to get the bottle of oil and anoint me with oil. She wasn't coming to Oh, honey or hubby or whatever more. She was coming to the office. &gt;&gt; I want you to take the bottle of oil and I want you to anoint me with oil. And I said, "Yes." We walked back into the kitchen. I took two chairs out. She knelt at the chair. I anointed with oil in the name of the Lord. And before we got back to the door, which was less than five minutes, she was completely healed. &gt;&gt; Does it work? &gt;&gt; Worksmen &gt;&gt; every time. If it doesn't work, I say, God, you're God. &gt;&gt; If you want us to carry this for a time yet, yet you're God. &gt;&gt; And I know one thing, we're going to walk on the other side in perfection. &gt;&gt; Are you with me? &gt;&gt; Did the congregation say amen? Let's say &gt;&gt; praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Isn't he wonderful? &gt;&gt; He's indeed wonderful. &gt;&gt; Let me just pray. Father, I do not know what all this strange service is to mean to the people or to those that are out and streaming, but my heart is going out to the people in a in a just strange way. I don't even know how to express it, but you know, oh God, reach into the lives and into the hearts. &gt;&gt; Perhaps someone is here that is weward. Perhaps there's a young person, oh God, that needs to take a step this morning. And if you are here, I'm now speaking to you. I'm interrupting the prayer to speak. If you are here and God has spoken to you very powerfully and you're prepared to come with a correct approach, you can stand where you are in your seat right now, man, woman, whoever you might be, and just stand and I will continue to pray. Father, these that you have touched or spoken to, whether seated or standing in whatever place they are. Oh God, we are not here filling in time. We're not here just to have a lovely service. We're here to do battle with the enemy. And we pray that you will slay him. We pray you'll bring him down and bring him low. We pray that you will break, oh God, complexes which have held people perhaps for years. take and smash those things. Oh God, I pray you'll destroy those shackles. Oh God, in the name of Jesus Christ, I pray, Father, that you'll take there's any spirit of disrespect, you'll remove it from the people. It'll hold them back from your blessings. Oh God, in the name of Jesus Christ, may there be vows renewed. May there be hearts that are made right. Oh father, we know that this is not an accidental meeting. This is an ordained by almighty God. Father, I submit myself to you now and present this congregation to you and present all those who are streaming. Father, just wonderful people. How we love them. Oh Lord, I pray you'll do for them what is needful. And now, oh God, your will be done on earth as it is in heaven. In Jesus Christ's name. Amen. &gt;&gt; I want to sing. I keep listening for another sound. You sing with me. here. See family in the land. There's questions in the children's eyes. Trouble in the east again. The whole world is shaking. There's no sure place to stand and a mortal sound is heard throughout the land. Let's just stand together, shall we? Sing. I keep listening for a different sound. Sound of the city that shall bow down. Sound of the crowd be united with the group. I keep listening. I keep listening. I keep listening for a different I remember the preacher saying it shall come to pass there will come a generation that will be the last. I can't believe I'm standing here seeing the end of time and the master in my mind but I keep listening the sound of seeing down. Sound of rising with the I'm listening. I keep listening. I'm listening. I keep listening for a different last words. I remember I remember the preacher saying you remember today shall come to pass. There will come a generation and that will be the last. I can't believe I'm standing here. in the end of time. And the creatures and we keep listening for different Sound of the brightest. I miss I listening for of Christ with the I keep listening. I keep listening. I keep listening for a different people. We've heard a different voice and we respond to a different sound. Friends, there's churches all over this whole Pacific Northwest. Not many, a few, but not many. Hear the voice that you have heard. &gt;&gt; That's what's made such a difference in our lives. Can ask brother Joe Waldner, you'll come. Brother Joe. Brother Joe heard his voice in a colony in Manitoba and brought his whole family and other sons came that are here. These are sons of the minister of the colony and that their father was reading the message books for a couple years before he passed away. I understand. Brother Joseph, his wife, their children, and sister Kathy. We sent airline tickets and the colony didn't even know that they were gone. And I believe her brother went in, drove in a car, and they all piled in with just shopping bags, left home, left furniture, left possessions, left mother, aged mother behind, couldn't come. And that's the that's the decision they came to. and came here. And God has honored that decision. My brother, my sister, I say to you in the name of the Lord, you will never regret &gt;&gt; receiving this word for at the level that it is. You'll never regret it. Hallelujah. Brother Roy. Glory to God. I'm rejoicing with you. I can feel what's in your heart. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. God bless this congregation. Amen. &gt;&gt; Brother Joel, privilege to turn the congregation to you for a word of prayer. Amen. Bow our heads in our hearts this morning.
