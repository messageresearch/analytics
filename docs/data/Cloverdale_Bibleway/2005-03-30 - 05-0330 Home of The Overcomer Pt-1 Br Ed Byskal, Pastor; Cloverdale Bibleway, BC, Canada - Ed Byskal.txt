Oh God, &gt;&gt; maybe the flesh is dark, but may the inside be full of light and happiness and joy. &gt;&gt; Raise her up, oh God, from her weakened state, bed of affliction. May she be in the house of the Lord Sunday morning where I know she desires to be. And Lord, I just lay my hands on these other requests. Oh God, Jesus, we believe there's a still a bomb in Gilead. We're thankful and grateful for the great supernatural mighty miracles that were done by you through our prophet William Brham. But we don't have to go back 20 and 30 and 50 years.

And some of the folks still lingering on from the wedding. We're thankful that you're here with us. God bless you. I'm going to ask you to open your Bibles to First Timothy the third chapter. And we also uh are going to look at second Corinians the fourth chapter. 1 Timothy 3 and 16. And without controversy, great is the mystery of godliness. God was manifest in the flesh, justified in the spirit, seen of angels, preached unto the Gentiles, believed on in the world, and received up into glory. I'd like you to notice because we're just reading this one scripture in this chapter. Great without without controversy, great is the mystery of godliness. God was manifest in the flesh. &gt;&gt; And part of that manifestation was justified in the spirit, seen of angels. That's all part of it. preached unto the Gentiles. That's how he was manifest in the flesh. Believed on in the world and received up into glory. Would you like to turn also to 2 Corinthians and the fourth chapter? I'm sorry. I think it's the fifth chapter. Yes. Chapter 5 and verse 18 and 19. And all things are of God, who hath reconciled us to himself by Jesus Christ, and hath given to us the ministry reconciliation. Number one, he hath reconciled us to Christ. That's number one. Number two, he's given to us the ministry of reconciliation to which that God was in Christ reconciling the world unto himself, not imputing their trespasses unto them, and hath committed unto us the word of reconciliation. Let's just pray. Our dear Lord Jesus, it is in your name that we approach to the Almighty God. We have an access this evening. We're so thankful we have a channel that's open to us. Job, as your prophet said, had a channel open to him by revelation. He came to know who God was. So I pray father that this evening you will open to us the channel of your word. Any man with strength can turn the pages but only the holy ghost can reveal what is in the pages and in the words. I pray that the very essence of them the very essence of your thought will come through Lord. Not into our emotional channel, not into just the realm of the our spirit, our human spirit, but down into the soul. Lord, do a transforming work. Let your work word be active within us tonight. Lord, I pray in the name of Jesus that you'll do whatever's needful in each of our lives. For your glory, we ask it. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. You may be seated. I said I would be speaking on the home of the overcomer. When the brothers came down, you know, there the brothers from the sound booth always come down of late because they want to be really efficient and and get the title of the message ahead of the service. So I said, "Well, here's the title, but it hasn't got anything to do with what I'm going to be speaking on." So So don't let the title throw you. But I I told you I would be speaking on Home of the Overcomer. So I will just call this part one. The last time we took a series, we were about six six services into it and we still weren't really done. But uh uh this will tie this will tie in for sure and you'll see which direction we're going. Uh said home of the overcomer. But the scripture says which we read, God was manifested in the flesh. And the scripture said to God was in Christ reconciling the world to himself. The scripture says in John, you can just listen to these now. John 1 John 4 2 and 3. Hereby know ye the spirit of God. Every spirit that confessth that Jesus Christ is come in the flesh, not has come in the flesh, but is come in the flesh. There's a big difference between this tense. He has come in the flesh because much of the world whether they believe on him or don't believe on him, they believe that he came in the flesh and lived and died and rose again. But that isn't what this scripture is saying. It says that he is in the flesh. Jesus said, "I in you." That's Jesus Christ in you and you in me and I in the Father. So he says, "Hereby know ye the spirit of God. Every spirit that confessth that Jesus Christ is come in the flesh is of God. And every spirit that confesseth not that Jesus Christ is come in the flesh is not of God." And this is that spirit of antichrist whereof ye have heard that it should come and even now already is it in the world. Now uh I've been speaking on this holy resourcerich nation. Could I have you agree with me that Jesus Christ was God's resource in the earth but he developed this resource? Everything didn't come to Jesus Christ on a silver platter. In fact is the scripture says who in the days of his flesh in the days of his flesh when he had offered up prayers and supplications with strong crying and tears unto him who was able to save him from death and was heard in that he feared. And though he were a son, yet learned he obedience by the things which he suffered. &gt;&gt; God developing this resource that was in the earth called Jesus Christ and developed that resource till God in his fullness dwelt in him. and was pleased to dwell in him. This is my beloved son in whom I'm pleased to dwell. The scripture says that there are many deceivers gone into the world. This is 2 John 1 and7. Who confess not that Jesus Christ has come in the flesh. This is a deceiver and an antichrist. In Hebrews the 10th chapter, it also reads verse 5, "Wherefore, when he cometh into the world, he sith, sacrifice and offering, thou wouldst not, but a body hast thou prepared me." This was a prepared body, not just a fashion here, a child being born. That's not what we're talking about. We're talking about a body. Hast thou prepared me? I will say and I would like you while while we each one and every Christian every believer likes to think well uh you know Jesus said I go to prepare a place for you and that's where we're going and he's preparing a place and not only that but he's preparing a people to that to go to that place and that preparation is something you know that is taking place and it's a very very real action of God &gt;&gt; in our lives &gt;&gt; very real and sometimes s it may not be all that pleasurable because even as it was with Jesus Christ, it says that he with strong crying and prayers and supplications and tears and he was heard of God. But nevertheless, he became he was he was a son and became obedient through the things which he suffered. So Hebrews continues in burnt offerings and sacrifices for sin thou thou hast had no pleasure then said I lo I come in the volume of the book it is written of me to do thy will oh God above when he said sacrifice and offering and burnt offerings and offering for sin thou wouldst not neither hast pleasure therein which are offered by the law. Then said he, "Lo, I come to do thy will, oh God." He taketh away the first, that he may establish the second. By the which will we are sanctified through the offering of the body of Jesus Christ once and for all. Now, you know, people will say amen to that and we accept that. But I want you to know that even though God was manifest in the flesh in a body, that body endured some incredible suffering. I'm not talking just about the cross. I'm talking about the rejection. I'm talking about the the hatred. I'm talking about the animosity. Talking about the misunderstanding. I'm talking about all kinds of things that we which Christ is still in the flesh. And if you expect that Christ is going to dwell in you, you can very well expect that these same responses are going to be to you as well. And it doesn't mean that God is against you. Has nothing to do with that. It's just a natural response of an evil age, an evil generation, and a godless world to a people who have Christ living in them. It's a natural outcome. It's a natural response. But the other thing is this is a there's a double benefit here. Not only is God dwelling in us and dwelling in our hearts and in our lives and in these vessels of clay. Not only that, but he is this is I want you to see now if Jesus Christ was God's resource that he would develop. I would say that some of the things that you are going through and you'll understand it a whole lot better after this service is over is God actually developing you &gt;&gt; as his resource in the earth and through you he's going to reflect himself and through you but he's like the song the kids used to sing he's still working on me &gt;&gt; in the fourth seal brother Brandham said in the fourth seal God's like a big contractor. He lays out all his material on the earth and then he builds his building. Now remember, before there was a grain of seed on the earth, before there was a sun that ever struck the earth, your body was laying on the earth. this body which is dust to dust. It was laying here on the earth &gt;&gt; because you are the dust of the earth. You you are and God's the contractor. &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham said when Jesus came up out of the water and John had baptized him and the dove in the future home and I love this phrase says he came up out of the water and the Holy Spirit coming down. He was the word made flesh and the Holy Spirit coming to the word and the word coming to the prophet. How perfect it is. John the prophet, Elijah and Jesus coming to him and the Holy Spirit coming to the word. And he says, "This is my part of the earth which I have redeemed. I've claimed it." That was a first part. He said that's my first part of the earth. &gt;&gt; That was the first one claimed by God. This is my son. &gt;&gt; He claimed it. &gt;&gt; This is my own. They're standing there in a body of flesh. That's very, very significant. Standing in a body of flesh. He said, "This is my son." He claimed it. And then the prophet says, "And through that part, he'll claim all the rest." &gt;&gt; Is that marvelous? &gt;&gt; And through this part, &gt;&gt; I will claim all the all the rest. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; God was manifest in the flesh. &gt;&gt; God was in Christ reconciling the world to himself. God developed that resource. Amen. &gt;&gt; And &gt;&gt; though he were a son, yet he learned obedience by the things which he suffered. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And brother Brandham's saying, then God's like a contractor. He lays all his materials out. And the scripture says in Hebrews 3:4, for every house is builded by some man, but he that built all things is God in a future home, which I'm going to show a lot of slides on it this evening, the Lord willing, giving me time. that God through this age, he said, is gathering up his material. In this age, he's gathering up his material. He's saying, "These parts are mine. &gt;&gt; These children are mine. This is my son." There's a lot of perhaps good men in the world when Jesus was walking here. But Jesus was his first part that he was claiming. And through that part, he'll claim all the rest. his materials. Let's talk about his materials for just a moment. David the Psalmist said 139 and 15, a scripture that you know well, "My substance was not hid from thee when I was made in secret and curiously wrought in the lowest parts of the earth. Thine eyes did see my substance yet being unperfect. And in thy book all my members were written, which in continuence were fashioned, when as yet there was none of them. That boggles the mind a wee bit. God saw our substance. &gt;&gt; Saw what we were before we were. &gt;&gt; He knew exactly how he was going to put us together. Amen. &gt;&gt; Like to make this statement. God's people are his resource in the earth. &gt;&gt; God's people. &gt;&gt; Listen to what he says. He says that Jacob, the Lord's portion, he said the Lord's portion is his people. &gt;&gt; Let it sink in. That's it. God's not interested in, you know, a whole lot of other things in the world. God's interested in his people. &gt;&gt; His people get a just get a picture of &gt;&gt; who God is for a moment. Let your imagination loose. Amen. &gt;&gt; Let the boundaries of your mind be broken and think who he is almighty holiness who we're not even we're not even worthy to even approach unto him. And yet this God is saying my people who I these parts that I've purchased these parts that I've claimed that's my portion. Amen. &gt;&gt; That's why we read in Ephesians uh a scripture that I thought of earlier and uh now it just comes back to me. So just give me a moment while I while I go to it quickly. Scripture you've heard many times and you know we've been speaking out of Ephesians because Ephesians is our inheritance chapter, our inheritance book. Ephesians is Joshua for us. &gt;&gt; All right, but listen to part of this. We could say, "Oh, the people of God, the children of God were going into their land, going into their inheritance, going into their inheritance." But just a moment, the scripture which we just read says that they were God's inheritance. They were God's evidence in the world. In other words, God through them was going to prove that he was God. He was going to prove that he would bring forth his plan with all of their failures and with all of their errors and with all of their sins and all of their rebellion and all of their captivity and and into Egypt and into Babylon and everything else. All of it nevertheless brought forth Jesus Christ &gt;&gt; brought forth salvation. Brought forth the covenant. brought forth the word of God &gt;&gt; of the Old Testament. &gt;&gt; And the New, &gt;&gt; Paul a Jew, &gt;&gt; Peter a Jew, &gt;&gt; they were Jews. Israel gave us this book. &gt;&gt; Is it true? &gt;&gt; Absolutely. So, they were God's portion in the earth. And they could say, "Well, we're moving into our inheritance." But God was saying, "But you are my inheritance." Let's read this scripture. Listen to it now. The eyes of your understanding being enlightened that you may know what is the hope of his calling and what the riches of the glory of his inheritance in the saints. &gt;&gt; This is a double a double reaction here. God wants you to know what's yours, but at the same time, he wants you to know that you are his. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; You are his inheritance. Amen. &gt;&gt; God wants to demonstrate and that's the only way he can demonstrate is through his own people. He'll demonstrate that he's God. How else is he going to manifest himself? And so because you are his resource in the earth and some of these things you've heard here before, I'm going to make reference to uh something that took place. God beginning with Abram. And it says in Genesis 22, "And it came to pass after these things." Abram had been through many things and finally had his name changed to Abraham and God had promised him a son and Ishmamail came along and all of these things happened and uh the way wasn't all that easy. But then it came to pass after these things that God did tempt Abraham. I want to bring you back to this thought because I've spoken on it before, just touched on it. I want you to take it so you can apply it to yourself. God did tempt Abraham and said unto Abraham, and he said, "Behold, here am I." And he told him, "Then take your son, your only son, and offer him in a place that I will show you." &gt;&gt; That was his greatest trial. And God let him go right through to the knife was raised. You know, you need to translate that into your life. God will let you go right through to the very point it seems that there is absolutely no way out of this thing. &gt;&gt; God will let you go that far. &gt;&gt; And God likes to do that. You'd say, "What purpose would that be?" Because as it as he tempted Abraham, the scripture here in the word tempt and it's very very interesting. It is to test and there's a certain part of this which I have emphasized before and I want to emphasize again and then carry on from it. It is to test and to try to prove but to assay. Assay which they use is a word used in mining often. It is after they take the drill core of uh uh when they send a drill down, they take a core of the earth and the rock and whatever more and then they will take that into a lab and they will grind up that that ore or the just the core the sample. And I've seen it with I've seen it myself in the mining labs and you see great long boxes just one after the other because as it goes down you can just see the the the earth in see the the structure of the earth as you look at that core and they can take a certain segment of it and they know exactly at what depth that came and then they they assay it. They grind it up to just powder. Just powder. And then they sift through that powder and they put it through the chemical process. And then they then they do uh there's a whole process which I want to get into a little bit later. And then they can tell how much silver is in there and how much of this metal is in there and how much of that metal. That is the assay. But you cannot stand on top of the earth and just you know guess what's happening down there. You can't just drill it. You can't just You've got to take that sample. And that's just a sample. And once they've taken that sample, now they're going to develop. They're going to develop a resource in the earth. And I'm talking now not about you looking at your potential. I'm talking about God developing you and his people as his only resource in the earth. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And friends, it doesn't come easy. It just plain doesn't come easy. &gt;&gt; And the first thing that you do in this kind of an industry is they have to discover. They make a discovery. And they discover here lies some wealth down here. And God found you. &gt;&gt; God discovered you. We say that often that you didn't find God, but God found you. In other words, someday, one day you were in some dark pit. &gt;&gt; One day you were under some some cloud or whatever more. But one day you were surely in a lost state &gt;&gt; and God discovered you. &gt;&gt; God found you. And then once you find this kind of uh wealth and they determine that this wealth is here, we have discovered that there's something here, that's not the end of it. They they don't go, you know, jumping and having a a great big party just yet because we haven't got it out. Then it calls for some real hard work. And they call it removing the overburden. And that is the earth and maybe rocks and whatever more that's on top of this uh this ore. But they've got to develop the ore. And I tell you what, friends, you come in with a big load of baggage. You come in with a lot of overburden on you. You come in with a lot of ideas, your own ideas. And God isn't even interested in your ideas. You come in with dogmas and you come in with traditions and you come in with religion and you come in with all kinds of man's ideas and God wasn't interested in it at all. So the first thing they had to do is start removing it. &gt;&gt; One of the things they need to do is they get in there and they blast it out. And you know, you can't always do it easy. You can't just, you know, help the he can't help the chick out of the egg. You know, he's got to pick his own way out. But there's a lot of times someone comes in, they come into the house of God. I've had him come in here say, "I got to save somebody out of that old cult." And they come in there and I know Brother Milo was one of them. He said, he said, "I just got blasted right between the eyes." I don't know what it was, but sometimes we need to have a blast, a big blast happen, and just split the thing open. What's it doing? It's just exposing something that is down inside, that is of value, that is of worth, and something that God wants. Now, I'll tell you what, friends, believe me, God will go to some real God will go to extremities. He'll go to extremities saying I'm going to I am going to develop that &gt;&gt; ore and he's looking for gold. &gt;&gt; It's God's gold &gt;&gt; and you might as well just give into it right now because he's going to he's going to develop it. &gt;&gt; He's going to put a thing through the mill. And once they've blasted it, that's just the beginning. Listen, I'm going to give you some scriptures in a few moments. I'm going to give you some scriptures. You'd be surprised how much in the scriptures that this is identified and then he you get removed out of there. You get you need to be conveyed someplace. So somebody brought you to church. &gt;&gt; Somebody got you under the sound of the gospel. I know one fell in Singapore. They were wanting to he was they invited him to come and see Deep Call of the Deep or one of the videos or something. I think it was Deep Call to the Deep. And uh this fellow was in uh in the army in Singapore and he didn't he didn't really want to go but he you know he this this believer had just been on his case and says come on come on you know I want to so he didn't want to go alone so he asked this other fellow he says I I'm going to see a picture tonight you know I'm going to see a they want to I want to see a film tonight some people are after me invited me will you come along cuz he wanted company guy he didn't know what it was about he said sure I'll come along you know so he just goes as company for this fella cuz this fellow was kind of scared scared and this guy who just went along, he just got smitten. And he's the one who came in, got saved. The other fellow never saw him again. This fell, that's how he came in. God knows how. He knows exactly how to do it. He knows how to get a hold of you. &gt;&gt; He knows how to convey you. Oh, he's not just conveying you to a bed of roses. &gt;&gt; No. When the ore comes out and they finally found something that's worthwhile and God has discovered something in the earth that's worthwhile, you know where he he conveys it. The first thing it has to go is to the crusher. &gt;&gt; It goes to a big jaw crusher or a cone crusher. And I have seen I've seen huge monstrous stones rock that was many many tons rock almost the size of half a house go into a huge cone crusher and in 3 minutes it's all gone. Sometime we may think am I going to survive? Well not in the state that we were in when we hit the crusher. We're going to survive but not in the same condition. We're going to come out the other end as fine powder, but in the powder is some gold. &gt;&gt; In the powder is something worthwhile. And it's still not done. Then it's conveyed. It's conveyed to a a ball mill or a rodmill or some kind of a mill. And it's just ground finer and finer and finer. And there's every believer. There isn't a believer in this place. But would have said, "I just don't know if I can take another day. Can anything else happen? And before you've even finished saying it, something has happened. &gt;&gt; Maybe not with you, but with me. &gt;&gt; How many honestly can say amen? &gt;&gt; My look at all that. My got a wonderful lot of friends here. That's exactly the way it happens. And we think it's the end of the world, but it's just the beginning. &gt;&gt; It's not It's not the It's not bad things, one bad thing after another bad thing. It's one good thing after another good thing. I tell you what, brother Tom, Brother Tom Ray, when he preached that message, you know who says it's bad. &gt;&gt; Now, we've all coined that phrase, maybe it's good. &gt;&gt; I'll tell you why. Now, maybe get a little bit serious. God God knew Abraham had faith &gt;&gt; but the assay proves what is actually there &gt;&gt; and then after that it's down to the finest powder. They put it into huge huge what they call separators and they got paddles in there and just a motor turning it slowly and that's a separator and it begins to separate and stuff begins to come out and come to the top and finally that water goes out into some uh quite often I don't want to get technical here but I' I've understand it quite well and they come into vibratory boards and these boards got little grooves grooves in them. It's the simplest thing in the world. Just little grooves. It looks like it's lino off the floor, you know, and they got little cut cut cut grooves in it and all this water that's coming. And if you looked out and saw this 200 ton truck hauling these monstrous stones and these great big crushers and all these conveyors and all of this equipment and all of these bulldozers and everything. And then you get through finally the end here's here's a little trickle of water coming out and his vibratory board is shaking like that. And that's what all of this four $500400 million mine is all about. And when it's done off the end comes a little bit of gold and some silver and other other types. and they keep refining it and they'll get a a brick of gold. I was in South Africa, my wife and I, and we went to a place and maybe some of you been there and Brother Gabe, you may have seen it. They got that big mine just out of Johannesburg and uh the gold came running right down. They had it all molten. Boy, it was pretty. It just come b pouring right down into a brick about that big about that thick. It was on a pedestal. Then they had one on a pedestal right there. They showed us how they poured it. But then they had one that was already cooled is on this pedestal. So they the small crowd there, maybe 40, 50 of us. There was some guys there muscles as big as my waist almost, you know. I think they kind of knew. And so they made an announcement. They said, "Whoever can pick this brick up can have it." It was worth about five or six or $700,000 at that time. Whoever This guy came down, I tell you what, he got a hernia. He was going to lift that thing. It was the last thing he did, but he couldn't lift it. Couldn't get off because now it had some real weight. But one day it was just under a great big pile of sod and dirt and mud and trees and all kinds of garbage and trash and had to remove that overburden. And one day you were in a pretty sad state. One day you just were all darkened and confused and whatever else. What am I saying? And God has brought you. And it hasn't been all easy, has it? &gt;&gt; We can say it's been wonderful, but it hasn't all been easy. &gt;&gt; Now, I'm just going to take you serious for a moment. Brother Brennan had a meeting right in Saskatoon, Saskatchewan. And he told about standing and he said this was I was at I remember the time standing at my latest temptation and my hardest. My wife was laying in the morg, just a young wife. And my little baby was lying dying. He's probably the age of you fellas right here. This young man, you can well imagine some of you just having a child. And the baby was 8 months old. And he said, "My little baby was laying dying, healthy little child a few hours before, but it took menitis." And he'd just come back from hearing his wife. He just come to the hospital. They said his wife died while he was there. Got home and they sent word for him to come immediately cuz his baby was dying. He said that was his hardest trial. Now listen close. I'm not telling just a sad story. This is a true story. This happened in our time. I went to the hospital and they had it in isolated ward and the flies were all over its little face, its eyes. I was just a young minister about 25 years old, mother dead and baby dying. I went in reverently. I got on my knees and I said, 'Lord God, what have I done? We all say that. What have I done? Here's Has there been anything that I've done to transgress you? Are you doing this? Oh, why are you tearing my heart apart? Don't take my little baby's a man that's going to stand before hundreds of thousands of people and call people that are just a shadow of life off of off of stretchers out of wheelchairs by the thousands. And he's pleading with God, save my little girl. Don't tear my heart in two. And he said, "She was just big enough that when I come around the corner and blow the horn, she'd raise her little hands out and say, "Goo." He said, "I just love children." And there she laid, and the menitis draw her all up. And just in a few hours, her little blue eyes had crossed and her little hand trying to wave goodbye to me. He said, "I couldn't stand it. I thought, "Oh, God, what can I do?" And I knelt down to pray. And when I prayed, I looked and a black sheet came down and God refused to hear me. He says, "I raised up and looked at the little thing." He was telling the same account and he said, "I never could stand because what happened?" He said he shued the eyes, he shued the flies from her face, from her eyes. And he says, "And when she looked at me, she was suffering so hard till those little baby blue eyes crossed. She was in such suffering. And when he saw that little darling her eyes cross under that pain, he says, "I never could stand I never could stand it to see a crosseyed child from then God finally developed the character to where he needed it to be." says, "From then I could never stand to see a crosseyed child and never." He said, "Never." He said, "And I have seen 400 and something cases of croseyed children healed in six months." Those mothers and fathers and those children who had crossed eyes didn't know what it took to bring a vessel &gt;&gt; to a place &gt;&gt; where he'd pray &gt;&gt; and God would hear him because God had developed the resource, &gt;&gt; right? and brought a son to obedience. &gt;&gt; Not because he had sinned, not because he had done something wrong, but because God want to develop it. And many times, most times, we don't understand. And 400 in 6 months, over 400 in 6 months. And it touches me because I sat just three rows down from the front right about where Sister Iris is sitting while a girl stood right here. And all she had was whites for her eyes. And I was so close. Sister Iris, I could look and I could just see a little bit of the ball of one out in the one eye stuck right up at the top of her eye. She was so pathetic. stone blind right in Vernon, British Columbia. And he prayed seven times because God had developed that resource and he knew her eyes. And every time he would look at her and when he finally prayed that seventh prayer, he never looked at her. He just turned her with her by the shoulders and turned her like that to the audience and lifted her up. And that girl's eyes were as straight as yours or mine. &gt;&gt; Several thousand people there that night. Friends, we say, "Oh, isn't this wonderful? Isn't it wonderful?" But how did it come? &gt;&gt; How did it come? young man, 25, with his wife not yet buried, just a young bride, not yet buried, and his first baby, second baby laying there. The Lord's portion is his people. And Malachi the prophet said, "And he shall sit as a refiner as a refiner and a purifier of silver. And he shall purify the sons of Levi and purge them as gold and silver that they why that they may offer unto the Lord an offering in righteousness." He wasn't doing it because because God's, you know, so gleeful with trying his people, but he does it because he's developing a character. He's developing something in us. And we ought to say, "Here I am, Lord. &gt;&gt; Here I am." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; A refiner who's one that is he takes and and and is it's like a smelter. Refine. And uh And even in the the word is called in the Hebrew it's called the proof test to prove it. David knew something about it. And I I pray that we'll have the same kind of attitude. Thou has proved my heart. Thou hast visited me in the night. Thou has tried me. And that's exactly what it is. tried is that same word refined. You have refined me in the nighttime. You've tried me and shall find nothing. I am purposed that my mouth shall not transgress. Amen. &gt;&gt; In 66 and 10 said, "For thou, oh God, has proved us and thou hast tried us as silver is tried. Give me a box of Kleenex. My you know we in the very first opening parts of the scripture opening chapter of Genesis you know brother Brandham says that if you don't see Christ in every every scripture you read it again. This whole scripture thinks this whole Bible is Christ. Right. In the very first part of the scriptures talking about the creation and so on and it and it talks about some rivers and it says the name of the first is Pishon that is which compasseth the whole land of Havilla where there is gold. God know where the gold is. &gt;&gt; He put it there. &gt;&gt; And the gold of that land is good. &gt;&gt; Amen. That's in the scripture. And I want to say here we are in this end time. God knew where he put the gold. &gt;&gt; God knew where he put the character. &gt;&gt; God knew that it was good gold. &gt;&gt; I put good gold there. &gt;&gt; And he knows all about refining it. and developing it until it shows. Brother Ram talked about the early times in uh in Arizona. It says that the native people there would take gold and they would beat it and beat it and beat it until they could see the very reflection of the beater in the gold. beat out all the dross and the pyite and all of the things. Beat it all out till they can see themsel in it. You know, this helps you to understand cuz quite frankly, I don't I think it's I think it's folly just to preach an easy gospel. It's not going to be an easy way. It's going to be a difficult way. And we are, as he said, going to fight for every inch. And when you know that, then then you're not going to be deterred by it. Because, you know, I'm actually tired of people that get slack and give up cuz I'm going through a trial. God wants you to go through it. &gt;&gt; God wants to be glorified in it. God wants to bring you out. God wants to demonstrate that he is God. You are his inheritance. You are his portion. He needs that. Glory. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Oh, I know that this isn't, you know, maybe what you want to hear on a Wednesday night, but &gt;&gt; it's what you're going to hear. Amen. &gt;&gt; It says in Revelation, I counsel thee to buy of me gold, not just gold, tried in the fire, that thou mayest be rich, and white raignment, that thou mayest be clothed, and that the shame of thy nakedness do not appear. and anoint thine eyes with eyes that thou mayest see in the masterpiece of God said before that they had the smelter they take the gold and beat it that's how he describes it and they beat all the iron iron pyite and the dross and the dirt out of it until the beater could see his own reflection like a mirror God's developing ing his. But there is a gold of God, the trial of your faith being much more precious than gold that perisheth. And he says, "The gold of God is a Christlike character produced in the fiery furnace of affliction." That is the right That is the right kind of gold. said, 'You'd better come before it's too late, sayaeth the Lord, and buy of me gold that's tried in the fire, and then you will be truly rich. And he said, listen, listen to me. Naked, I want you to hear it. Many of you believers have read it perhaps many times. Naked physically we came into the world but naked spiritually we will not leave it. &gt;&gt; Oh no we are going to take something with us and what that something is is all we can take with us nothing less and nothing more. So we had better be real careful now to see that we take something that we will that will make us right before God. You're going to take something with you. &gt;&gt; And so then we what will we take with us? We will take our character. &gt;&gt; So always watch that character. Always watch that character. He says, "Now, what kind of character will you take with you?" See, he didn't say that to bring condemnation on the people. He said that so that we be, you know, we would examine our heart. what kind of character you know if we if we don't understand the assay test if we don't understand it I don't think it does anything for us spiritually to cry out to God every time we come into a test a trial and we say um now just hear me out oh God deliver me out of this thing. Oh God, deliver me out. What if what if it's a what if it's something that God wants to do? &gt;&gt; What if it's something that God is developing? &gt;&gt; Wouldn't it be better to say, "Lord, here I am. &gt;&gt; This is a difficult time, but I know that you'll deliver me if that's what you want to do. But nevertheless, here I am. &gt;&gt; I'll submit myself &gt;&gt; to whatever it is. Your will be done." As we heard Sunday night on earth and in earth as it is in heaven, let your will be done. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; This age can be nothing other than has been declared to be. And it's an age of pressure. &gt;&gt; It's an age that's complex &gt;&gt; and it will increase to be that because it's going to be worse and worse. &gt;&gt; Hear me out. We have all kinds of dilemmas and all kinds of complexities. And whether it be family or whether it be marital or whether it be on the job or whether it be uh whatever it is, it just becomes more involved and more entanglements and all the rest of it. And the believer has to be very very focused &gt;&gt; on the kingdom. We've got to be very focused to see the eternal side of it. said the character that's what you'll take with you. Will it be like his whose character was molded by the suffering in the fiery furnace of affliction? Or will it be the softness the softness you know in this this age? I mean, you know, if you got the least pain or the least, you know, you got indigestion, you overeat, you got this little thing. Hey, maybe this is just a meat and potatoes service. But I'll tell you what, this age is not something that develops rugged people. &gt;&gt; But the prophet of God called for rugged believers. And I think that we should expect, we should expect that if we have the same, if we're going to be uh the very agent, the very vessel for the Lord Jesus Christ, then I announce to you in the name of the Lord, you are going to have all kinds of difficulties come your way. But you, it's it's how you respond to them. And you can just say, "I'm going through whatever it takes, and this is happening for a good reason, for a good purpose." And God knows. &gt;&gt; God knows whether it's with much or whether it's with little, whether things seem to be going ahead or whether they seem to be uh going in reverse. The thing that you have to know is that your heart is right before God. That's what a person needs to know. They need to know that their heart is in a place where you you have communion with God whether it's difficult or whether you know things seem to be uh relatively quiet and easy. The softness of this age I know what it's all about. You know, we don't want to go back to you. Ladies don't want to wash on a washboard. You want the latest automatic thing there is with all the bells and whistles. The men, they don't want to go back to an old beat up kind of vehicle that uh can't hardly operate. No, we want something. Check it all out. Make sure it's soft enough. I'm on your case. Don't worry. The lease just got up in my car and I've been looking around. So, I'm driving my wife's old clunker. You're very quiet. She said that she just she does. I said, "You need to have another car." She said, "No, I do not want another car. Don't buy me another car." I said, "This is a an this is an old" She said, "It's 14 years old." She said, "I'm just happy to tell everybody that." &gt;&gt; She just said that to me in the car as she come to church. So, I'm just happy it's 14 years old. I love to tell people this 14 years old. I said, "This is like a 1938 Chevrolet that this car is. It's all little old thing. I like to get rid of it." No, she doesn't want me to get rid of it. She said it's a good car and I just want to keep it. But you know when I get you know he can we're all human I feel it's nice and soft and all the things that's his age you know the biggest pressure is to say no to it that's the hardest thing in the world say no now I'm going to show you a few slides because uh and then I'm not going to comment comment much on these but this is I'm taking I'll tell you what I'm doing and then you'll understand it because I will be coming back to it. This is a some very potent statements out of a future home because God is developing a people for a place. And I'd like to say this before we just go to them. He said that the exact same process that he's bringing the whole earth for a millennium where you are going God's people are going to live. You are part of the earth. And so he's bringing you through the same process by baptism and justification, by sanctification, and by a sealing of a baptism, a fire of the Holy Spirit. Those three, making you fit for a dwelling place for God himself to come and indwell you. You got that? Now he said he baptized the earth under under Noah and when Christ dropped his blood on it and claimed it that was the act of sanctification. He claimed it for his own and it will have its baptism of fire which Apostle Peter in his epistle said that the heavens were on fire and the earth and the heavens passed away. And the prophet describes how it it didn't annihilate it that he is he is renovating it to make it a fit place not just for God but for God and his people. And so the reason why we're caught in a very difficult place is because we've been justified. Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; We've been sanctified. &gt;&gt; We've received and been sealed by the Holy Spirit. &gt;&gt; We've gone through the three. But we're in a world that's only gone through two. &gt;&gt; We're in a world that is awaiting its baptism of fire. &gt;&gt; We're in a world that's not yet purged and cleansed. We're in a world that's violent with all kinds of filth and evil and perversion. And we're uncomfortable. We're not at home &gt;&gt; because we've already been cleaned and claimed, justified, and sanctified, and baptized with the spirit of God. And we're in a place that's unfit &gt;&gt; for a believer. &gt;&gt; It's unfit for us. &gt;&gt; And you can't possibly feel at peace and at rest. And this happens and this influence and these words and and that picture and this magazine and that newspaper and this radio broadcast and that joke and this person you work with and this cussing and damning and this site and that site and and the thump thump of the boom box and all the rest of it. It's it's uncomfortable. &gt;&gt; We're not at home. &gt;&gt; But even in the midst of it, don't let it ever get the best of you. It's not intended. It's intended that you should be victorious over it. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And we're going to come to our ultimate goal victoriously. &gt;&gt; That's according to the scripture. &gt;&gt; And brother Brandham starts out and I'm going to just move through these rather quickly and not going to keep you late. I'm watching the time here. Now I want to see I want you all to read as we go one at a time. Says we are here to turn our attention towards eternal things and the life that lays beyond this mortal rage. I would like to take those two lines and brand every heart in this building with that we're here in this life every day if we should focus and turn our attention &gt;&gt; because Satan in this world is is so demanding of your thoughts and your time and your focus and your attention. You can be as busy as you want, but you can still be heavenly minded. &gt;&gt; People say they get so heavenly minded or no earthly good. I say that's absolutely incorrect. You're no earthly good till you are heavenly minded. &gt;&gt; Heavenly minded and a life that lays beyond this mortal reach. We pray in prayer that you will give us your direction. Believe that prayer was answered. How that we must turn, what we must do in the future and even in the present now to gain that place that we have been promised. How many want to gain that place that we've been promised? That's why you're here. &gt;&gt; He says, I've wrote down some scriptures, some notes just to hit the highlights. So remember, it's just a highlights where it'll let you study. He that overcomemeth, that's why I call this the home of the overcomer, shall inherit all things, and I will be his God, and he will be my son. Second Peter. Now you if you want to jot these down. Second Peter the 3 chapter and Revelation 21 both are speaking the same subject. However, we understand that this great home of the bride is to be here on earth. But John never wrote it out like Peter did. John just said, "I saw a new heaven and a new earth." Now, I just want to stop there a moment. Number of weeks ago spoke on worlds colliding. Remember the ancient Hebrews have no understanding of the world as the Greek cosmos, the world system. They have no understanding. They have no word that compares with that. What the ancient Hebrews had in order that they might understand the world. The world to them was history because that's how God, in other words, they could see how God dealt with the people. History and covenant. Those two, history and God's promise. They could see the trajectory of how God dealt with people, how he kept his word and covenant. That to them was the world. I wish we had that understanding that we would look back and see how God has worked in the past. And the prophet said, "If God ever did it once, he'll do it the same time if those conditions are met once again." If God ever honored faith, he'll honor it again tonight. Do you believe that? &gt;&gt; If God ever did it, if he ever showed a certain compassion in a certain way, met a certain set of circumstances, when he sees it again, he'll do it the same. Because God cannot change his mind about his word. And so the ancient Hebrews, they looked back, they they saw what God had done, and then they remembered his covenant. And that to them was God's order, God's system, God's program. That was God's cosmos. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; That's far better than this arrangement that we have. &gt;&gt; And so he said I and then the scripture says in the beginning God created what? The heavens and the earth. And that was the Hebrew understanding of it. I John saw the holy city come down from God out of heaven prepared as a bride adorned for her husband. But we turn back to second Peter now and find out Peter explains how this process will come about. What John said it sounds like for the first heavens and the first earth were passed away or annihilated. But it's clear that both of these apostles and prophets are t talking of the same thing. But these passages, by these passages, one may think or be led rather to believe that the whole planet of this earth will be destroyed. I make a new heaven and a new earth that the heavens will be gone and the earth will be gone completely annihilated. But a close study and with the help of the Holy Spirit, we can see that the truth of this and that's what we're going into. It is only the atmosphere around it and the sin that's upon the earth that will be destroyed. Then these thistles and sicknesses and death and politics and sinful men and sinful women and evil spirits will be gone away and annihilated. That's what'll be annihilated. Amen. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Now, we're talking about the overcome, the home of the overcomer, &gt;&gt; or the overcomer's home, however you want to have it. I'd like you to notice I'm trying now as I show you this to get you into my study thoughts. It's how I study. Then these I watch this then these thistles. That's his earth. When the fall came says, "And now the earth will bring forth thistles. It'll bring forth thorns. It'll be hard." So that's the earth. And sickness, that's this earth. &gt;&gt; And sickness to me is a big thistle. Sickness to me is no friend. So he's talking about the earth itself. He's talking about the men and and people that are on it and death. That's the end that it comes to and politics, the system, the cosmos that they're under. And sinful men and sinful women and evil spirits will all be gone. Brother Brandam in one little paragraph has actually handled the whole thing. &gt;&gt; What she's saying is it's all going to be cleaned up. It's going to be purged by a holy fire from Almighty God. A fire that doesn't just burn wood. A fire that just doesn't purify gold, but a fire that will take an evil spirit and put them to a whisp of of nothing but flame, smoke, and gone. &gt;&gt; I tell you what, that spirit, that demon that dealt with you today, &gt;&gt; and you say, "Are are you sure?" Absolutely sure. Because there isn't a person here. If no, if no demon power tried to persuade you or tried to put a thought in your mind or a word in your mouth or something else, then you aren't any of God's. Because I'll tell you, every servant of God, every child of God is under test by every day, every hour of the day. &gt;&gt; And that spirit that tries the child of God, God despises that thing. But he's even just using it to bring forth something out of you because he's finding out that that spirit can that spirit cannot he's got one focus that's to destroy you. You've got another focus that is that we return to eternal life. That's our focus to our immortality. That's our focus. And a person needs to keep their focus on that. Otherwise, you become very very disheartened. Oh God, when are we going to get out of this thing? Just say, we're going to get out when God wants us out. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And after you have tried me, I'll come forth as pure gold. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Do you believe it? &gt;&gt; And all of this is in existence that's in the earth now. Man-made systems. politics and sin, all kinds of evil spirits that the world is contaminated with. And all the heavens above us in here is contaminated with evil spirits. And I can tell you that is absolutely for sure. Amen. &gt;&gt; You know, after brother Brandham was done meetings, after even a single meeting, say those demons that had been cast out would try to torment and haunt him and keep him from rest and sleep. &gt;&gt; Absolutely true. I know men have been with him when he's walked right into a hotel room. He just looked around said they can't stay here and he told me when they were in England and in a some auditorium or something. He told me about what he could see and what he saw in the other realm. Friends, you don't have to see it to know that it's very real and very present. very real and very present. But I'm here to tell you tonight, it's only sent for the benefit of the believer. &gt;&gt; That enemy can do nothing against you that will that will succeed. Nothing. &gt;&gt; In fact, God is allowing it to prepare you and make you even more fit and ready. Isn't that something? &gt;&gt; Making you more fit and ready. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. It has to be done that way because we're going to live right here. We'll prove that by the Bible. Right here is where we live. All this exists in the heavens or atmospheres and the earth which is now. This earth holds these things. But it wasn't made for that purpose. This earth wasn't made for that purpose. It was made by God the creator. And all of our bodies that we live in now were put on the earth when God created it. You're out of the dust of the earth. What did God say to the serpent? Dust shalt thou eat all the days of your life. It's really unusual, but these old physical bodies are consumed. And the scripture also says dust to dust. But just like God said to Satan who came before him when he wanted to come against Job, God allowed Lucifer, allowed Satan to attack his body. But that's as far as he would allow him to go. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Thus far and no further. You can consume his flesh, but you cannot, God said, you cannot touch his life. &gt;&gt; You might get sick. You might get afflicted and you might die. Those that are not raptured, we're all doomed to death. And yet, it's not a doom. &gt;&gt; It can only convey you into the very presence of God. Even death itself cannot defeat the believer. That's why we can be so victorious even in a funeral because it is just a the the horse has been hitched up to the to the cart and has taken you into the presence of God. &gt;&gt; I just thought I'd put that in as a bonus. It was all laid out here when God himself created it. You were in his thinking and in him the great eternal was the thought which is his attribute. And now sin caused all this to happen. God through this age. I should have underlined this is gathering up his material. That is not just a little light statement. That happens to be a very powerful thing. In fact is if you want to know what I personally believe, I personally believe that's why you are even here. &gt;&gt; God is gathering up his material. God gathered you. God didn't just find you. &gt;&gt; God didn't just discover you. &gt;&gt; God blasted you out &gt;&gt; of the earth, &gt;&gt; out of your place where you were so nicely thought you were so nicely settled. God conveyed you to a place where he broke you down, &gt;&gt; crushed you, &gt;&gt; did he not? &gt;&gt; And brought you to the mill and put you in the separator. took you to the potter's house and you felt the flame and the fire and the oven, but you come out of it and here you are to be a fit vessel for the spirit of God and God himself. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; That's the purpose of God. &gt;&gt; And in this age, he's gathering up. He is gathering up. Wasn't you say, I decided to go to I decided to be part of this group. No, it's not that at all. You can't even come if God didn't call you. And the call of God was his act of gathering up. When he called, he's already saying, "You are mine. You don't belong to anybody else. You don't belong to any church. You don't belong to any denomination. You don't belong to any man. You don't belong to any system. You belong to me. &gt;&gt; Excuse me, Sister Elner, you don't mind if I just make this personal. I'm going to close in now just a moment, but sister Sister Ellen Drake, I think you were a Sunday school teacher, weren't you? Sunday school teacher and for years and years and years the United Church of Canada and she came to the knowledge of Christ in the light of this message. I'm sure she lived a good life even in the United Church, but she was under that system. Came and find out denomination is not of God. And so she thought in all kindness and respect she should write them and let them know that they wanted to take her name off the book. And so they wrote back and said, "We did a search and we can't find your name on our book." And she was a member there and said she just praise the Lord. She never was a member on that. [Music] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; There's another book that'll be open &gt;&gt; and there'll be names on that book. And every every one every particle that God gathered, that name is already on that book. &gt;&gt; And nobody can take it out. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Well, God in this age is gathering up his material. And I think that's just where we'll end. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Thank you for giving me an extra few minutes. I want to sing this house. that that song will always have something special for me. This house, I don't know why. Why did they choose that for the for for the anniversary? Do you know? I don't know. But it's very suitable. This house. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. We might not be much, but just want to be a house &gt;&gt; for God to dwell in. &gt;&gt; Shine in me. Manifest. Can you think of anything higher? &gt;&gt; No. &gt;&gt; Any of you folks on the balcony or anywhere, can you think of any calling higher &gt;&gt; than to have God himself say, "I want to dwell in you. I would like to show myself tomorrow to somebody. I'd like to just manifest myself. Will he be my house? &gt;&gt; Will he be my vessel? Don't whine and whimper when things go sideways &gt;&gt; cuz all he's doing is fixing his house. &gt;&gt; Somebody have to help me here. &gt;&gt; You know, uh the one I sang at the anniversary, this is your house. Come and dwell. This is your house. Brother Derek, can you help me? [Music] Let's stand. This is your house. Come and dwell. This is your house. It's a holy house of prayer where the lost hand we bring our burdens and their cares. This is our house. This is your house. Come and dwell. &gt;&gt; Find those nice words. Sing it again. This is your house. [Music] Come and dwell. This is your house. [Music] It's a holy house of prayers where the lost and the lonely bring their burdens and their cares. This is your house. [Music] This is your house. coming well. [Music] Our dear Lord Jesus, lovely Christ. These people that have gathered here tonight have not gathered here in vain. They've not gathered here to show socialize. They've not gathered here to just be seen or to put in another Wednesday evening. But they gathered that they might hear something that would touch their soul. They gathered that there might be a fresh breeze of the Holy Spirit that would fan the embers. Lord, this world has a cooling effect. It would cool our spirits, cool our zeal, cool our fervor. But oh God, we resist all of that in the name of Jesus Christ. And we say, "Oh, Holy Spirit, breath of God, &gt;&gt; wind that came, a mighty wind in the upper room of the day of Pentecost. &gt;&gt; I pray that you'll breathe and blow upon every heart, every soul, every person that is in this place, oh God, that is under the sound of my voice on the internet or wherever they may be this evening. And I pray for those that are out of touch, out of fellowship. Oh God, cool in their experience and perhaps tonight engaging in something that they ought not to do. I pray that you'll speak to them and deal with them and bring them, oh God, and let conviction fall upon them. your children, oh God, though they may go into bondage and though they may get cold and though they may disob disobey you, I pray forgive them, oh God. Forgive them, Father, in the name of Jesus Christ, I ask that you'll permeate the very atmosphere here. We hear how your messenger, your prophet messenger, oh God, speaks of these atmospheres and how well we know that they're contaminated. We think of what is traveling through that fourth dimension being picked up by televisions and transmitted, oh God, around the world and into space. Oh God, but one day, one day it will be purged with a holy fire. And we say, "Bring it on, Lord. Bring it on." Oh Lord, we say even now, oh God, we are, we feel ready, Lord, we just feel ready. We want to step into that perfect place that you are creating a home for the overcomer. I pray dear Lord that you'll strengthen, you will invigorate, you will give grant courage to every believer. This is my prayer. I'm calling on you Lord to do this that you'll strengthen. Some are perhaps in a difficulty maybe in a physical situation. We think of our sister Marge Miller. Oh God, what a valiant soldier she is. Oh God, what a radiance upon her face. I pray, oh father, that you'll fill that room and fill her body with the virtue of Jesus Christ. Let resurrection life, oh God, rule. Let resurrection life press everything else out that's contrary to that life. It is our prayer, oh God, our desire you'll bring her out from that hospital bed in the name of Jesus Christ. Hallelujah. We pray, Father, that you will work your work in our lives. And when things do not seem to go the way we expected it, may we not question you. &gt;&gt; May we just simply dedicate ourselves more completely and say, "Thy will be done on earth and in this earth as it is in heaven." In the name of Jesus Christ and for the glory of God. Thank you for these lovely, sweet people that have come out, Lord, and are here tonight to with their presence to bless one another. I ask that you'll go with them. Give them safe journeys. Dismiss us with your grace and your blessings in Jesus Christ's name. Amen. This is your house. [Music] Come and dwell. Can you say that? This is your house. Come and dwell. Isn't that nice? This is your house. This is your house. Come and dwell. Amen. Shake hands with another vessel. another pilgrim. Amen. Bless you, brother Derek. [Music] Hallelujah. [Music] Yes. [Music] Everything [Music] Hallelujah. [Music]
