[15:18] Hoffman. Brother Darren, if you'd come

[15:21] this morning. There's a request that's
[15:24] come from uh brother Ron Borthwick
[15:27] and this requesting we pray for sister
[15:30] Karen Belarski's parents. Um

[15:48] buried yesterday and last night her
[15:51] mother, dad and died and uh sister Karen

[15:58] probably have to do a repeat in a few
[16:00] days time. and the two children, Shar
[16:03] Sarah and Jonathan. Um
[16:06] I said, "Brother Tony has kept so busy
[16:08] with all two and he's now concerned for
[16:10] his wife's health and um
[16:14] the funeral was just finished when she
[16:16] got the call from the hospital to attend
[16:18] her dying mother and her mother didn't
[16:20] even know that her husband had died. So
[16:22] we want to pray for sister Karen this
[16:25] morning. Uh there's a request that we
[16:27] pray for brother Dutch Scott's family.
[16:29] his dad passed away. Want to remember

[16:48] request prayer. She's at home sick. We

[17:37] them as they go overseas and keep them
[17:39] in the center of his will and also
[17:41] there's a testimony here from our sister
[17:43] Lisa St. John, the doctors in Florida
[17:46] and Washington had thought Samuel was
[17:48] having seizures when he's sleeping, and
[17:50] we finally had him tested at their
[17:52] insistence. Praise God, there were no
[17:55] seizures, and want to thank God publicly
[17:57] for his faithfulness in healing Samuel
[17:59] completely. We give God all of the
[18:01] glory. Amen.
[18:06] So, let's remember these requests this

[18:10] this morning, hasn't been mentioned, the
[18:12] Lord knows what it is. And if you're

[18:17] take it before the Lord as you go to
[18:18] prayer and the D.
[18:26] Let's pray.
[18:32] Heavenly Father, we are thankful, Lord
[18:34] Jesus, we can come,
[18:37] Lord, that we can come before you this
[18:40] morning.
[18:42] Lord, we're truly such a needy people,
[18:44] Father.
[18:46] Well, I'm thankful, Lord God, that we
[18:47] have one who is allsufficient.
[18:50] One that is able to hear our heart's
[18:51] cries, Lord. One that sees our
[18:54] conditions. One who experience what
[18:56] we're going through. You know the pains,
[18:58] Lord. You know the agonies, Father. You
[19:00] know the tears, Lord, that we go through
[19:02] each day, Lord. You're mindful, Father,
[19:04] of of your children, Lord, and what
[19:06] they're going through, Father, and how
[19:08] that can give us such comfort, Lord
[19:10] Jesus, knowing that we're not alone,
[19:12] knowing that you're by our side. You
[19:14] said you'd never leave us nor forsake
[19:16] us, but that you'd be with us, even in
[19:18] us to the consummation of the ages,
[19:20] Lord. And this morning, Lord Jesus,
[19:22] you've heard, Lord, the prayer requests
[19:24] that Brother Rod has mentioned, Lord. So
[19:27] many of them, Father. Many more, Lord
[19:29] Jesus, that weren't even mentioned,
[19:31] Lord. prayers that are being tucked
[19:32] within the hearts of your people. Lord,
[19:34] those that are sick, Father, those that
[19:36] are in need of financial help, Lord,
[19:39] those that are need of spiritual help,
[19:42] uh, mental health, Father, we ask, Lord
[19:44] Jesus, that you are as you are the
[19:46] provider of our every need, Lord, that
[19:48] you go to each one of these needs, Lord.
[19:50] Those that have have that have their
[19:52] hands raised up, Father, may they not be
[19:54] left out, Lord Jesus. those on the
[19:56] internet, Father, those that are part of
[19:58] the congregation, Lord, may you go to
[20:00] them and meet them in their hour of
[20:01] need, dear God. Lord, we think of these
[20:04] ones that have lost loved ones, Lord.
[20:06] Our sister Karen, I believe our brother
[20:08] Dutch Scott, Lord. Father, I pray that
[20:10] you'll go to them, Lord Jesus. I pray
[20:12] that you'll bring them comfort, Lord.
[20:14] How there are missing lives in their in
[20:17] missing people in their lives now,
[20:18] Father. Lord, there's there's holes,
[20:20] Lord Jesus, where which were once filled
[20:22] with loved ones. Lord, I pray that
[20:24] you'll go and that you'll be very near
[20:26] unto them. And Lord Jesus, through the
[20:29] trial, Lord God, bring them strength,
[20:31] Lord. Bring them comfort, Father. May
[20:34] they be stronger, Lord God, through this
[20:36] trial. Lord, we think of all those that
[20:38] are ailing in body, Lord Jesus. So many,
[20:41] Father. Lord Jesus, we Lord, we know
[20:44] what you've done for little brother
[20:45] Samuel, Lord. Father, Brother Bram, if
[20:47] we just have the right mental attitude
[20:49] toward any promise of God, you'd bring
[20:51] it to pass, Lord. So give us that right
[20:54] mental attitude. Father, let us confess,
[20:57] Lord Jesus, that we're already healed.
[20:59] Let us claim the promises of God.
[21:01] Father, increase our faith, Lord Jesus,
[21:04] that unbelief would scatter, dear God.
[21:06] And Lord Jesus, that you would back up
[21:08] our confession by bringing to pass your
[21:10] word, Lord, not the words of a man, but
[21:13] words of Almighty God. Lord, that we can
[21:16] confess, that we can claim for ourselves
[21:18] and for our loved ones. Lord, we ask,
[21:21] Lord Jesus, that you'll meet each one.
[21:24] Father, we ask that you'll come and
[21:26] speak to us through our pastor this
[21:27] morning, Lord. Father, we're a needy
[21:29] people. We need our faith increased,
[21:31] Father. We're in that cycle of the
[21:33] rapture, Lord. And where are we today,
[21:35] Father? We're closer and we want to be
[21:38] ready for it, Lord. Father, we want to
[21:40] be used this year, Lord, as you just
[21:43] been speaking to our pastor about this
[21:44] being the year of witness. Let us be
[21:47] witnesses, Lord. Let us be bright and
[21:49] shining lights. Let us brighten the
[21:51] corners where we are, Father. That our
[21:53] loved ones would see the glory of God.
[21:55] That they would see Jesus Christ veiled
[21:57] once again in human flesh. That they
[21:59] would desire what we have, Lord. Father,
[22:02] because it's for them. Because you said
[22:04] the promises unto you and to your
[22:05] children, to them that it's far off, as
[22:07] many as the Lord our God shall call. So
[22:09] we're claiming our loved ones, Father.
[22:11] We're claim each and every one of them,
[22:13] Father. We'll not leave one of them
[22:14] behind. So give us strength, give us
[22:17] courage, father, to press on in this
[22:18] year, Lord Jesus, to be better examples,
[22:22] better witnesses of the resurrection of
[22:24] Jesus Christ. This is our desire, Lord,
[22:27] to honor you, to worship you, Lord, to
[22:30] praise you. And Lord, just thankful that
[22:33] your word says that these signs shall
[22:36] follow them that believe, Lord. and all
[22:38] these prayer requests that we've spoken
[22:40] of. Lord, help us, Lord God, as we wait
[22:42] upon you, knowing that these shall come
[22:44] to pass. Those things we've asked for.
[22:47] Be with us now the remainder of the song
[22:48] service. Lord, strengthen us, we pray,
[22:52] Lord, and just remembering Brother
[22:53] Burkhard, Sister Doris, Father, as
[22:54] they'll be traveling, give them
[22:56] traveling mercies, Lord. Father, just
[22:58] pray that they'll have a blessed time, a
[23:00] fruitful time, Lord, and bring them back
[23:02] to us safely. We ask in Jesus Christ's
[23:05] precious name. Amen.

[42:06] This is my song
[42:09] praising myior
[42:15] all the day.
[42:19] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[42:22] Thus, we're here this morning to give
[42:25] him praise and thanksgiving. Hallelujah.
[42:28] Wonderful presence of the Lord. I really
[42:32] appreciate
[42:33] everyone who's here
[42:36] and uh
[42:38] just before we read the scripture and
[42:41] all if you don't mind remaining standing
[42:44] for just a moment and you'll be you'll
[42:46] be seated in a bit. Uh we we join with
[42:51] congregation of our brother
[42:54] pastor Schumacher in Germany who was
[42:57] called to be with the Lord in the last
[42:59] couple days. And uh this is the brother
[43:03] he had uh he had a some heart difficulty
[43:08] and I think a kind of a minor heart
[43:11] attack or a major heart attack. I don't
[43:12] know which. And here he was he came
[43:15] right to the pulpit a day or two right
[43:17] afterwards and has been taking his post
[43:20] there and we don't have any other
[43:22] details and just to say that he was
[43:25] called to be with the host of witnesses
[43:28] &gt;&gt; just quickly
[43:30] we've prayed for our sister Norma Smith
[43:33] uh who has pneumonia she was taken to
[43:34] the hospital last night about uh
[43:37] midnight and her daughters and
[43:40] granddaughter Sister Jen Johnson other
[43:42] sisters are with her and Sister Sharon
[43:45] Braxton. I believe I really have a great
[43:49] deal of respect for Sister Norma Smith
[43:52] just as quiet spirit godly woman and
[43:58] comes always to the house of God under
[44:01] any circumstances or condition. And so I
[44:05] know that she'd just dearly love to be
[44:07] here this morning. And we say, "May
[44:09] God's Holy Spirit hover in that room and
[44:12] be near our sisters that are there. And
[44:15] may his perfect will be done. I don't
[44:18] want to see her suffering at all." So,
[44:20] God be with her.
[44:22] We didn't have a time on New Year's Eve
[44:25] to say everything we would like to have
[44:28] said. Uh but I I want to make a comment
[44:32] uh regarding our our brother Richard
[44:35] Drake who's standing here. And our
[44:39] brother Richard Drake is a has been a
[44:42] been here since been a a young teenage
[44:44] boy in a long time. And he has a a
[44:48] responsible position with the Translink
[44:51] and the bus system, but he has a
[44:53] responsible position also amongst the
[44:56] bride of Jesus Christ. and he has taken
[44:59] as a personal commission really to send
[45:03] humanitarian aid to the Ukraine to
[45:07] orphanages to Russia to Siberia in the
[45:11] far north has worked with brother Gido
[45:14] and it unbeknown to perhaps many in the
[45:18] congregation that we need to take time
[45:20] and think about it uh and because I
[45:23] believe that as much as you have done it
[45:25] under one of the least of these my
[45:27] brethren
[45:28] you've done it unto me. And brother
[45:31] Richard has collected clothing from
[45:34] schools uh because he used to work in
[45:36] the school system and has connections
[45:39] gets clothing that's left at the schools
[45:42] uh that's left on the buses that is sent
[45:45] here from churches in different places
[45:47] until we've had to tell people don't
[45:49] send anymore. But this year's this last
[45:53] year's shipping totals was 9,752
[45:59] pounds to the believers and orphans of
[46:02] the Ukraine. That was a total of 212
[46:05] boxes
[46:08] and 29 boxes
[46:11] uh to the believers and orphans in
[46:13] Siberia.
[46:15] And from the initiation of each of these
[46:18] projects, from the initiation of each of
[46:20] these projects, our monthly average for
[46:23] boxes that have been shipped stand at 16
[46:28] boxes per month to the Ukraine and one
[46:32] and a half boxes per month to Siberia.
[46:35] That's since the program was initiated.
[46:38] And I want to say to uh brother Richard
[46:42] and uh the men of vision under whose
[46:45] opaces this has all been happening
[46:47] during this time. God bless you for the
[46:50] last year. And God prosper you even much
[46:53] more in the f in the future years. And
[46:55] it's not just clothing but other things.
[46:57] They've sent dried food and the and the
[47:00] thanks the letters of thanks that have
[47:03] come from these places. in fact is the
[47:06] the director of the orphanages in the
[47:09] Siberia has said that men of vision is
[47:12] the only organization
[47:14] that stood by their promise and said
[47:17] they would do something and have done it
[47:20] and I say God bless you brother Richard
[47:22] and those that help you. Amen. I think
[47:24] they deserve.
[47:34] Amen. Let's just have a word of prayer,
[47:36] please, before we turn to the word.
[47:39] Lord, our hearts are filled with
[47:41] thanksgiving
[47:43] that we could be called the sons and
[47:46] daughters of God to be birthed into this
[47:49] family to have Lord the opportunity and
[47:53] the privilege, the honor to call others
[47:56] that are around on the surface of this
[47:59] globe in other countries our brothers
[48:03] and sisters. Lord, you have called our
[48:05] brother Schumacher to come into your
[48:08] presence to a higher calling to join
[48:13] this great host of witnesses. Pray for
[48:16] his assembly. Pray for those that are
[48:18] stepping into his uh place of
[48:21] responsibility.
[48:22] Give them wisdom, oh God. Give them
[48:25] courage, I pray. May they declare your
[48:28] word with a mighty witness. And father,
[48:31] as we are gathered here today, we have
[48:34] uh uh many needs amongst us. We've heard
[48:37] the prayer already that's been prayed,
[48:40] but now we pray especially, Father, as
[48:43] your word lays open before us that it
[48:46] will be illuminated. And may we be a
[48:49] quickened people. May we be illuminated
[48:52] by the Holy Spirit. And father, I pray
[48:54] that all of the flu, all of those
[48:57] channels of the flesh and all of those
[49:00] channels to of the spirit that all the
[49:03] memory and the imagination and all the
[49:06] other affections, oh God, and things
[49:08] which would be hindrances, I pray that
[49:11] the Holy Spirit of God, the flame of
[49:14] God, the fire of God will burn everyone
[49:17] clear, Lord, and may the word have free
[49:20] access to the soul And let that one
[49:24] channel, Lord, be filled with faith. Let
[49:27] it be supercharged with faith, oh God.
[49:30] And as the word is spoken, I pray, Lord,
[49:33] it'll be illuminated every individual in
[49:35] the name of Jesus Christ. Anoint us now,
[49:38] Lord. We thank you for it. Amen.
[49:41] &gt;&gt; Amen. We believe it, don't we?
[49:45] &gt;&gt; Turn in your Bibles, please, to John,
[49:49] John's Gospel, the 12th chapter.
[49:53] We're going to read some verses from
[49:56] starting with verse 27.
[50:20] Now is my soul troubled,
[50:23] and what shall I say? Father, save me
[50:26] from this hour.
[50:28] But for this hour came I But for this
[50:31] cause came I unto this hour. Father,
[50:35] glorify thy name. Then came there a
[50:39] voice from heaven, saying, I have both
[50:42] glorified it and will glorify it again.
[50:48] Then down to on down to verse 32.
[50:51] The people therefore that stood by and
[50:53] heard it said that it thundered. Others
[50:56] said, "An angel spake to him." Jesus
[51:00] answered and said, "This voice came not
[51:02] because of me, but for your sakes. Now
[51:06] is the judgment of this world. Now shall
[51:09] the prince of this world be cast out.
[51:13] and I, if I be lifted up from the earth,
[51:17] will draw all men unto me. I'll have you
[51:21] read that verse 32 together with me, and
[51:25] I, if I be lifted up from the earth,
[51:29] will draw all men unto me. While you're
[51:33] still standing, Brother Brandham made uh
[51:38] I think a very very significant point
[51:41] when he came to this verse. He turned to
[51:45] it in the first seal
[51:47] before the seals were now to be
[51:49] delivered and preached and he turned to
[51:52] John the 12th chapter
[51:55] and began with the 23rd verse.
[51:59] And he said, "Now listen here real
[52:02] close,
[52:03] and then you won't have to wonder no
[52:06] more what it is." And Jesus answering
[52:10] them said, "The hour is come that the
[52:13] son of man should be glorified."
[52:16] So you're at the end of an age
[52:20] there.
[52:22] His ministry is ending.
[52:25] I draw want to draw your attention. The
[52:27] prophet's ministry too was ending.
[52:31] The hour has come that the son of man
[52:34] should be glorified. And he said, "Then
[52:36] what about the hour has come that when
[52:40] his bride must be taken away?"
[52:44] What that hour? What the hour has come
[52:48] that time shall be no more? And the
[52:51] angel is ready to set one foot on land
[52:53] and the other on the sea.
[52:56] With a rainbow over him, that's the
[52:58] covenant.
[53:00] With his with feet and say, "Times run
[53:03] out."
[53:04] &gt;&gt; And besides that, he raised up his hand
[53:07] and swore that time
[53:10] would be no more. And the scripture says
[53:12] that it's that time will be no more.
[53:15] There'll be no more delay for those
[53:17] things that have been sealed.
[53:19] &gt;&gt; Amen. And now he says and and he says
[53:22] time has run out and besides that he
[53:24] raised up his hand and swore that that
[53:27] would be that time would be no more when
[53:30] this happened. How perfect it is. He
[53:33] said a sworn affidavit to the church.
[53:38] The hour is come that the son of man
[53:40] should be glorified.
[53:42] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And he is glorified in the
[53:45] fulfilling of his promise.
[53:47] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[53:49] I'll have you read with me two other
[53:51] scriptures, three scriptures actually.
[53:53] Isaiah the 11th chapter
[53:58] and we'll read verses 10, 11, and 12.
[54:05] And in that day
[54:08] there shall be a root of Jesse which
[54:10] shall stand for an end sign of the
[54:12] people.
[54:14] To it shall the Gentiles seek and his
[54:17] rest shall be glorious. And it shall
[54:20] come to pass in that day that the Lord
[54:24] shall set his hand again the second time
[54:26] to recover the remnant of his people
[54:29] which shall be left from Assyria and
[54:31] from Egypt and from Pathos and from Kush
[54:34] and from Elam and from Shinar and from
[54:37] Hamoth and from the islands of the sea.
[54:41] And he shall set up an end sign for the
[54:44] nations, and shall assemble the outcasts
[54:47] of Israel, and gather together the
[54:50] dispersed of Judah from the four corners
[54:53] of the earth. God bless you as you have
[54:55] your seats.
[55:02] I want to greet you all the wonderful
[55:05] name of our Lord Jesus Christ
[55:08] and all who
[55:10] are joined with us today
[55:13] from many places around the world and
[55:16] it's an increasing congregation
[55:19] and we say God blessings upon them as
[55:22] well gathering in rooms
[55:26] in perhaps
[55:28] places where they've chosen to gather
[55:31] and so they are with us and we are one
[55:33] body
[55:34] &gt;&gt; in Christ.
[55:36] I want to speak to you today on the ends
[55:41] message. Nine ens
[55:46] the end sign.
[55:49] The scripture says that he will set up
[55:52] an end sign.
[55:55] And an end sign
[55:57] is simply something that is lifted up, a
[56:01] standard,
[56:03] a signal or a banner.
[56:06] An end sign is a rallying point,
[56:10] something we rally around.
[56:13] It is something that is not only to be
[56:16] lifted up, but we think of an end sign
[56:19] as a a flag or something that we
[56:21] identify with.
[56:24] And uh
[56:28] we all are identified as as as
[56:31] individuals
[56:33] we are identified immediately we think
[56:36] of we're identified with a certain
[56:38] nation.
[56:40] Uh I understand that even this month
[56:43] there has been a great deal of pressure
[56:45] upon the Canadian government by the
[56:48] American government
[56:50] to cause the people within this country
[56:53] that do not yet have uh legal status as
[56:57] a as a passport.
[56:59] They're perhaps on visas, student visas,
[57:03] visitors visas, etc. within Canada and
[57:08] America wants them to have Canadian
[57:11] passports. And so there's a enor
[57:14] enormous Russian crush at this time for
[57:18] everyone to get their passports and
[57:20] hundreds are lining up trying to get
[57:23] their passports so that they will be
[57:25] able to freely cross the border back and
[57:27] forth. What is America saying? We want
[57:31] we want a a country to step up to the
[57:34] plate and take responsibility that these
[57:37] people are indeed citizens of the
[57:40] country and then they have freedom to go
[57:42] back and forth. And uh of course I don't
[57:45] want to get into this but Canada says
[57:46] well give us a little more time because
[57:48] there's so many people that are here and
[57:51] we've got to process all of these
[57:53] documents. As individuals,
[57:56] we are identified with a a country or a
[58:00] nation or a place or a people, but yet
[58:03] we we may not have been
[58:07] uh personally in attendance when great
[58:12] events took place and unfolded within
[58:16] the country to which we are associated
[58:18] with or identified with. But yet we are
[58:21] identified with what that country stands
[58:24] for.
[58:26] &gt;&gt; And when they put up their flag and uh
[58:29] uh we we have respect and awe and
[58:32] reverence to what that flag represents
[58:35] because it represents a people. It
[58:38] represents a culture. It represents an
[58:40] idea. It represents uh either democracy
[58:44] or dictatorship or freedom or or
[58:47] whatever. it it represents a free market
[58:50] or it represents something that we say I
[58:53] identify with that and uh uh however we
[58:57] we may not you know be in agreement with
[59:00] everything that our nation stands for
[59:04] but uh
[59:06] we are still identified with it and
[59:09] brother Brandham says to be an American
[59:13] I must be identified
[59:15] with my nation
[59:18] When I am born here in this country, I
[59:22] become a citizen and I'm identified with
[59:25] this nation. All it is, all that it is,
[59:29] I am. All that it has been, I am. For
[59:35] I'm identified as an American. Then I
[59:37] have to take all of its shame,
[59:41] all of its glory. Whatever it is, I am
[59:45] because I'm identified with it. And
[59:48] Almighty God unveiled. He said, "I'm
[59:51] identified with a group that feels the
[59:54] spirit of God."
[59:57] &gt;&gt; I'm identified with a group that knows
[1:00:00] he's unveiled.
[1:00:02] &gt;&gt; I'm identified with that group.
[1:00:04] &gt;&gt; I can say that.
[1:00:06] &gt;&gt; You can say that. I trust you can say
[1:00:08] that. I'm identified with a group of
[1:00:10] people that believe that the bride of
[1:00:13] Jesus Christ has been called. I'm
[1:00:16] identified with a group of people that
[1:00:18] believe we have heard indeed the rapture
[1:00:21] call and we're on our way in that
[1:00:24] direction. I believe that. And he said
[1:00:27] he's identified with a group that knows
[1:00:30] that he's unveiled and knows he's the
[1:00:34] same yesterday, today, and forever. were
[1:00:37] identified with that group of people,
[1:00:39] identified with that kind of a message.
[1:00:42] Do you believe that?
[1:00:45] &gt;&gt; Just laying a foundation now.
[1:00:49] &gt;&gt; There was only a few, I would say, brave
[1:00:52] American Marines
[1:00:56] that were actually on
[1:00:59] the hill called Euima.
[1:01:02] But a whole nation
[1:01:04] identifies
[1:01:06] with it. One of the most famous pictures
[1:01:11] that's many know perhaps and don't even
[1:01:15] know why it's a famous picture, but they
[1:01:19] they they see it, but there's a people
[1:01:21] and a nation that is identified with it.
[1:01:25] And there's a reverence and respect that
[1:01:29] is attached to such an event.
[1:01:34] When a flag or an end sign is
[1:01:38] desecrated,
[1:01:41] stepped on, spit on, and burned.
[1:01:45] There's a a resentment or a disgust that
[1:01:49] comes within a person that that because
[1:01:53] there is a a feeling that's being
[1:01:55] expressed not not to a piece of cloth
[1:02:01] but to a whole people to a whole idea to
[1:02:05] a whole thought to a whole way of life.
[1:02:07] We're saying these people hate the way I
[1:02:10] live. They hate the country and the
[1:02:13] things that we stand for. And so it's
[1:02:16] something that is really raises feelings
[1:02:19] of resentment.
[1:02:22] An end sign is raised to be looked upon
[1:02:25] with a sense of pride,
[1:02:29] awe,
[1:02:31] respect
[1:02:33] and to give courage.
[1:02:37] Also,
[1:02:39] it identifies ownership. It's an
[1:02:42] evidence of ownership.
[1:02:47] We fellowship around a message. And I
[1:02:50] want to come to just a moment in a few
[1:02:53] moments, but I'm going to show you
[1:02:58] some end signs
[1:03:01] and just to recap in visual form what we
[1:03:06] have
[1:03:07] uh what I've been saying up to this
[1:03:09] point. And thanks brother Aaron Hardy
[1:03:11] for assisting me. And I wonder now if
[1:03:14] the brothers would just run through
[1:03:15] these video clips. All that you see here
[1:03:19] are identified in this congregation. And
[1:03:21] perhaps we've missed some
[1:03:39] just about couple two three seconds.
[1:03:42] Congo,
[1:03:44] Trinidad,
[1:03:46] Bosnia,
[1:03:48] Germany,
[1:03:51] Holland,
[1:03:53] Belgium.
[1:04:51] I want to show you a short actually clip
[1:04:56] of what took place for this famous
[1:04:59] picture
[1:05:04] of the Marines on
[1:05:11] Just takes a moment for the brothers
[1:05:13] too.
[1:05:16] Bring it around.
[1:05:30] This cost
[1:05:32] while we're going back to the picture.
[1:05:34] This cost 4,000
[1:05:38] uh American lives
[1:05:40] in just a very very short time. 4,000
[1:05:45] more than died in 911
[1:05:48] and 20,000 Japanese that were attempting
[1:05:52] to defend
[1:05:54] just they say, well, it's just a piece
[1:05:57] of rock.
[1:05:59] Uh
[1:06:01] but it has some significance
[1:06:04] and it was a strategic point.
[1:06:08] And when these boys, you'd think when
[1:06:09] there's artillery and mortar shells and
[1:06:13] ships blasting the this piece of stone,
[1:06:18] this rock, and dive bombers bombing it,
[1:06:22] just bombing it to gravel, to pebbles,
[1:06:25] and all of this cost. and men lying
[1:06:28] everywhere wounded and crying and
[1:06:31] screaming and men dying. Uh that's
[1:06:36] 24,000
[1:06:38] men in a short 24,000.
[1:06:41] A reasonable city that perished in a
[1:06:44] short time in an island that has that
[1:06:47] has no buildings on it, no nothing. And
[1:06:50] in the boy's minds,
[1:06:52] in the boy's minds with all of this
[1:06:56] noise and the den of war and the emotion
[1:06:59] of the moment, somehow
[1:07:03] they had it in their hearts and minds
[1:07:06] to go up that steep hill several
[1:07:10] hundreds of feet and there raise the
[1:07:13] flag of their nation, old glory. And
[1:07:18] this picture was shot and it's very very
[1:07:21] famous picture and we may go to the next
[1:07:24] one. We have a
[1:07:30] an end sign.
[1:07:38] &gt;&gt; This came at great cost.
[1:07:42] This is the one that's been raised up.
[1:07:45] He was lifted on this pole
[1:07:52] for the world to see,
[1:07:54] desecrated,
[1:07:57] spit upon,
[1:07:59] beaten,
[1:08:01] hated, despised, rejected,
[1:08:05] and still is today.
[1:08:08] This one has gone through a second
[1:08:09] crucifixion.
[1:08:11] You know that this living Christ is
[1:08:13] alive today and is despised by the world
[1:08:17] and hated by the world. But God has
[1:08:21] lifted him up
[1:08:23] &gt;&gt; high and lifted up
[1:08:25] &gt;&gt; is this end sign is this banner. And
[1:08:29] he's in our end sign. Hallelujah.
[1:08:33] &gt;&gt; And we'll rise to whatever position we
[1:08:36] need to. We'll climb whatever hill.
[1:08:39] We'll span whatever country. We'll cross
[1:08:42] whatever ocean. We'll go up to every
[1:08:45] mountain and cross the mountain ranges,
[1:08:48] whatever is necessary to lift up this
[1:08:50] end sign and say, "He's not dead. He's
[1:08:54] alive." Hallelujah. And the life of him,
[1:08:58] it's not a piece of cloth, but the life
[1:09:01] of him has come down into me, into you
[1:09:05] as by the Holy Spirit. And he I can
[1:09:08] declare he's alive.
[1:09:11] &gt;&gt; He represents my country.
[1:09:14] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:09:17] &gt;&gt; That's more than stars and stripes,
[1:09:19] friends. It's more than crosses and
[1:09:21] emblems of different kinds. This is our
[1:09:25] end sign.
[1:09:27] &gt;&gt; And God sent a messenger in our time to
[1:09:31] declare to you, he's not in the grave.
[1:09:34] He's alive. Amen.
[1:09:36] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And to tell us we are
[1:09:39] citizens of another country.
[1:09:42] &gt;&gt; Our citizenship is not here.
[1:09:45] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:09:47] &gt;&gt; Maybe something went through our heart
[1:09:49] as we saw the different flags of my
[1:09:51] country. Some are more patriotic than
[1:09:53] others. But I'll tell you when this when
[1:09:55] this one comes up that I identify with
[1:09:58] him. Identify with this end sign. I
[1:10:02] identify with this message to some
[1:10:05] people perhaps the message doesn't mean
[1:10:07] anything but when I say the message of
[1:10:09] the hour it has come here at great cost
[1:10:12] and I say this is he identifies he
[1:10:16] represents my nation he represents my
[1:10:19] citizenship I have my passport in his
[1:10:23] countrymen
[1:10:27] &gt;&gt; and he will turn he will turn and reveal
[1:10:31] himself
[1:10:33] to the people of this next flag.
[1:10:35] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:10:40] &gt;&gt; And they too
[1:10:41] &gt;&gt; shall know that this one is their king.
[1:10:46] &gt;&gt; This one is their end sign also.
[1:10:51] &gt;&gt; Thank you.
[1:10:58] Thank you brothers.
[1:11:03] We're identified
[1:11:05] with all of its glory.
[1:11:08] We're here today as part of the human
[1:11:10] community.
[1:11:13] And as humans, we're identified with all
[1:11:16] of the failures of humanity.
[1:11:19] We're identified with Adam and Eve's
[1:11:21] transgression
[1:11:23] and their fall. We're identified with
[1:11:26] the deception that took place in the
[1:11:28] Garden of Eden. We might say, "Well, I
[1:11:31] don't identify with as a human in the
[1:11:33] human community." We all are marked
[1:11:38] &gt;&gt; in our bodies
[1:11:40] &gt;&gt; by what happened in Eden
[1:11:42] &gt;&gt; because every man, every woman, every
[1:11:44] child here is identified by death.
[1:11:49] &gt;&gt; In a as a human, we're dying. But as a
[1:11:53] son of God, we're alive.
[1:11:56] &gt;&gt; We have eternal life. And that eternal
[1:11:59] life never had a beginning and does not
[1:12:01] have an end.
[1:12:03] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:12:04] &gt;&gt; And if we don't have that, you're lost.
[1:12:07] &gt;&gt; Hopelessly lost.
[1:12:09] &gt;&gt; And if you haven't come to the time
[1:12:11] where you say, "I switch my allegiance
[1:12:14] from my country
[1:12:16] &gt;&gt; to that end sign of the word of God."
[1:12:20] Hallelujah.
[1:12:22] Doesn't mean we reject our country. Not
[1:12:24] at all. I say that the only real true
[1:12:27] good citizen of a country is a bornagain
[1:12:31] &gt;&gt; son or daughter of God.
[1:12:39] &gt;&gt; We are identified with it.
[1:12:41] We're identified with Adam's
[1:12:43] transgression. And the Bible says, "For
[1:12:46] if by if by one man's offense death
[1:12:51] reigned by one,
[1:12:55] I may be misunderstood and perhaps I may
[1:12:58] have to even go back and explain some
[1:13:00] things, but the scripture says that
[1:13:03] death reigned." Reigned that's supremacy
[1:13:08] by one death became king.
[1:13:16] Much more they which receive abundance
[1:13:18] of grace and of the gift of
[1:13:20] righteousness shall reign in life by one
[1:13:25] Jesus Christ.
[1:13:27] &gt;&gt; That as sin hath reigned unto death,
[1:13:30] even so might grace reign through
[1:13:35] righteousness unto eternal life by Jesus
[1:13:38] Christ our Lord. Now the believer can
[1:13:40] say grace is king. Amen.
[1:13:43] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:13:44] &gt;&gt; Death was king. Death reigned by one
[1:13:47] man. And in the human life in the human
[1:13:50] body, we're identified in our body.
[1:13:53] We're marked
[1:13:55] &gt;&gt; by his transgression.
[1:13:57] You you can say this morning as I spoke
[1:13:59] last Sunday on attribution by
[1:14:01] attribution, you can say, "I didn't ask
[1:14:03] for this. I didn't ask to be born in a
[1:14:06] world filled with sin and trouble and
[1:14:09] injustice. And I didn't I didn't ask to
[1:14:12] be born in a world that's full of war
[1:14:14] and our best boys dying on the fields.
[1:14:18] &gt;&gt; 54 million
[1:14:20] &gt;&gt; died in the last Second World War. 54
[1:14:23] million. And you never heard it until a
[1:14:25] prophet came and said the earth was
[1:14:27] suffering a birth pain.
[1:14:30] &gt;&gt; It had a great birth pain in the First
[1:14:32] World War. and and men were gassed and
[1:14:35] laid out on the on the grounds of of of
[1:14:38] the best of all of the countries. We're
[1:14:40] not in we're not here to take up the
[1:14:42] sight of one against the other or this
[1:14:44] one against that one. It's it's it's
[1:14:46] sin.
[1:14:48] &gt;&gt; It's the devil. It's death.
[1:14:50] &gt;&gt; It's is all that comes. It's from Satan.
[1:14:54] &gt;&gt; And the pride of man and the deception
[1:14:56] of man has cost us a very great price.
[1:15:01] &gt;&gt; No wonder. I mean, it it should beat in
[1:15:04] the heart of every of of any man, any
[1:15:07] woman that even has a basic human
[1:15:09] intelligence. They ought to say,
[1:15:11] "Whoever started this entire globe here,
[1:15:14] this little piece of dust that's
[1:15:16] circling out into the great universe,
[1:15:19] whoever started it, it's time for him to
[1:15:21] come back. It's time for him to correct
[1:15:24] it all. It's time for him to take and
[1:15:26] burn this pollution out of the earth and
[1:15:29] out of the air." And the prophet says,
[1:15:31] "And he shall do it and make it a thick
[1:15:34] dwelling place for himself and his
[1:15:36] bride." Hallelujah. I rejoice in that,
[1:15:39] friends. It's going to be a whole lot
[1:15:41] more than an evila.
[1:15:43] Calvary. That piece of rock on Calvary
[1:15:46] where they put the cross of Jesus Christ
[1:15:49] and hung the son of God there dying for
[1:15:52] you and dying for me. I tell you, that's
[1:15:54] our end sign.
[1:15:58] The boys fought a bloody battle getting
[1:16:00] up on top of bee with Jima. But I'll
[1:16:03] tell you another one. He didn't go with
[1:16:05] a whole bunch of guns. He didn't go with
[1:16:07] a bunch of ships backing them up. He
[1:16:09] didn't go with dive bombers coming down.
[1:16:12] He walked up there alone.
[1:16:14] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. He walked up alone. God in
[1:16:18] the flesh.
[1:16:20] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:16:20] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:16:22] &gt;&gt; And he would not be deterred from his
[1:16:25] footsteps. Those are the bloody
[1:16:27] footsteps that walked up to the Mount
[1:16:30] Calvary Goltha and there hung alone
[1:16:34] before a world.
[1:16:36] I tell you my brother, my sister, that's
[1:16:38] why you're here.
[1:16:40] &gt;&gt; We're not here just having church. We're
[1:16:42] here to say I swear allegiance to the
[1:16:44] lamb.
[1:16:48] With all that I am, with all that I can
[1:16:51] be, with all that I have and all that I
[1:16:54] am,
[1:16:55] &gt;&gt; I swear allegiance to this one.
[1:16:58] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:17:00] &gt;&gt; And the scripture goes on to say,
[1:17:03] "Nevertheless,
[1:17:05] death reigned from Adam to Moses." Death
[1:17:09] reigned. Death was king from Adam to
[1:17:12] Moses. Why? Because it was not until
[1:17:15] Moses when God would raise up this one
[1:17:20] who was first a prophet with the word in
[1:17:23] his mouth and come down from another
[1:17:26] mountain si with the word in his mouth.
[1:17:29] And it says and death reigned from Adam
[1:17:31] to Moses even over them that had not
[1:17:35] sinned after the similitude of Adam's
[1:17:39] transgression.
[1:17:42] You might say, "I didn't sin like Adam
[1:17:44] sinned. I didn't do that. I didn't want
[1:17:46] that."
[1:17:49] But we're identified with it
[1:17:52] &gt;&gt; as humans.
[1:17:54] And the penalty came upon us by
[1:17:57] attribution.
[1:18:01] &gt;&gt; I know a little bit about death. So do
[1:18:04] you.
[1:18:07] I've stood by
[1:18:09] the caskets of too many people. I've
[1:18:11] stood in the in the rooms of too many
[1:18:14] people
[1:18:17] that are dying.
[1:18:19] How brother Brandon says nothing wants
[1:18:21] to die. Animals don't want to die.
[1:18:23] Things always are are doing everything
[1:18:25] they can to escape death and the agony
[1:18:28] of death. They don't want to die. Birds
[1:18:30] don't want to die. Nothing wants to die.
[1:18:32] They try to escape. says a man struggles
[1:18:36] and he says with the death gurgling in
[1:18:38] his throat striving trying to struggling
[1:18:42] to just get another breath and live a
[1:18:44] little bit longer. He doesn't want to
[1:18:46] die but he says the dying tree and the
[1:18:48] dying flower the dying man down here
[1:18:51] only testifies that there's another land
[1:18:54] where the tree doesn't die and the
[1:18:56] flower doesn't die and the man the woman
[1:18:59] doesn't die. Hallelujah. Do you want to
[1:19:02] go there?
[1:19:04] &gt;&gt; Do you plan to go there? Have you made
[1:19:06] your reservations? Do you plan to be
[1:19:08] there?
[1:19:12] &gt;&gt; That's why we're here.
[1:19:14] &gt;&gt; We're not here just having church. We're
[1:19:16] not here just to have a good time. We're
[1:19:18] certainly not here to be entertained.
[1:19:20] We're here to be a participant in this
[1:19:23] great body called the body of Jesus
[1:19:25] Christ,
[1:19:26] &gt;&gt; the bride of Jesus Christ.
[1:19:28] &gt;&gt; And the message that you say you
[1:19:30] believe. Even we've come here in comfort
[1:19:32] of your car or your automobile and come
[1:19:34] into this uh into this sanctuary and sit
[1:19:36] here today in the comfort of this room.
[1:19:39] Just remember this message did not come
[1:19:41] here in that kind of comfort.
[1:19:43] &gt;&gt; This message came here with a little
[1:19:45] prophet. You ought to you ought to
[1:19:47] listen to and and hear a service and
[1:19:49] just watch where he went the next day
[1:19:51] and the next day and the next day week
[1:19:53] in and week out and month in and month
[1:19:55] out with hardly a moment rest for his
[1:19:58] body. And I I can't even imagine knowing
[1:20:01] what time it takes for me to study and
[1:20:03] prepare for a service. And he's going
[1:20:05] night after night after night and having
[1:20:08] the people come forward and and they're
[1:20:10] pulling on him and the visions that are
[1:20:13] coming till they're almost packing him
[1:20:15] out. Literally are packing them out.
[1:20:17] That's how this message came.
[1:20:21] &gt;&gt; Didn't come for us to sit and quibble
[1:20:23] about. didn't come for us to sit and try
[1:20:25] to find some little uh special thing
[1:20:28] that ex excludes everybody else. That
[1:20:31] isn't why it came. It came so we could
[1:20:34] include the others.
[1:20:37] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:20:42] And as we did not transgress after
[1:20:45] Adam's transgression, after the
[1:20:48] similitude of his transgression, the
[1:20:50] penalty of his transgression passed upon
[1:20:53] all.
[1:20:55] &gt;&gt; Okay. What is the way out? What is the
[1:20:58] answer for this? God has made a program
[1:21:03] and the program happens to be very
[1:21:06] simple. But it is absolute.
[1:21:09] &gt;&gt; And that program is this. God speaks his
[1:21:13] word.
[1:21:15] God confirms that word as being his
[1:21:18] word.
[1:21:20] You and I are responsible to believe
[1:21:24] that word.
[1:21:26] &gt;&gt; And in the simple act of believing it,
[1:21:29] God looks down and says, "You are
[1:21:32] righteous."
[1:21:33] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:21:35] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. By my decree, you are
[1:21:38] righteous.
[1:21:40] &gt;&gt; On this side is an unbeliever. By his
[1:21:43] decree, you're a dying human
[1:21:47] &gt;&gt; and you're already dead spiritually. But
[1:21:50] by his decree, if you simply believe
[1:21:53] what he said and believe it's his word
[1:21:56] and say, "I believe it," he declares
[1:21:59] you're righteous.
[1:22:02] &gt;&gt; And he he gives you the gift of eternal
[1:22:04] life. though you could never earn it.
[1:22:08] &gt;&gt; It is that simple.
[1:22:11] &gt;&gt; Some say, "I want a deep res
[1:22:13] revelation." That's a deep one.
[1:22:17] &gt;&gt; That's a deep one.
[1:22:19] &gt;&gt; Because if Satan wants to do anything,
[1:22:22] he'll he'll sidetrack people, get their
[1:22:24] minds going a multitude of different
[1:22:27] directions, trying to get you away from
[1:22:29] the main main uh theme. And that theme
[1:22:32] is do you believe or do you disbelieve?
[1:22:43] As I mentioned last week,
[1:22:46] when God had raised
[1:22:49] out of the dust of the earth,
[1:22:53] you might not even looked at flags
[1:22:56] and whatever you thought when your flag
[1:22:58] came up,
[1:23:01] it it it wouldn't even begin. It
[1:23:03] wouldn't even be a spark of what was in
[1:23:06] God's
[1:23:09] mind and heart
[1:23:12] when he saw all of his creation was made
[1:23:16] and came up and let the grass bring
[1:23:18] forth and let the waters bring forth and
[1:23:21] created created his Eden
[1:23:25] &gt;&gt; and it was so marvelous.
[1:23:29] And then he put his own son there
[1:23:32] &gt;&gt; an end sign
[1:23:34] that this is mine. This is mine. And it
[1:23:38] was so wonderful when he had finally
[1:23:42] took out of the dust of the earth and
[1:23:44] raised the dust to its highest position
[1:23:47] &gt;&gt; and had one like himself
[1:23:50] &gt;&gt; and he came down
[1:23:52] &gt;&gt; and had to have fellowship with his son.
[1:23:56] &gt;&gt; Oh, and he walked with him. I believe
[1:23:58] there's just something very special in
[1:24:01] the very mind and heart and bosom of
[1:24:03] God. It's coming now, the cool of the
[1:24:06] day.
[1:24:07] &gt;&gt; Amen. Oh, I look forward to this time in
[1:24:10] the cool of the day when I'll be able to
[1:24:13] go down and fellowship with my son and
[1:24:16] walk with them in the in the beautiful
[1:24:19] gardens of paradise and have the trees
[1:24:22] and the and the uh the birds singing and
[1:24:26] be there and have fellowship.
[1:24:29] &gt;&gt; That was his end sign. And he raised it
[1:24:32] up. This is my standard. This is my
[1:24:36] image. And then the image fell.
[1:24:39] &gt;&gt; The image was worse than spit on. The
[1:24:44] image was disgraced
[1:24:46] and it was crushed and it no more
[1:24:49] resembled him.
[1:24:55] The prophet says he went right away.
[1:24:58] &gt;&gt; I will raise it up again.
[1:25:01] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. I will rebuild it again. I
[1:25:04] cannot leave it laying down there in the
[1:25:06] dust. I cannot leave it there stepped
[1:25:08] on. I can't leave it there dying.
[1:25:13] &gt;&gt; I will raise it up again.
[1:25:17] &gt;&gt; And he could only raise it up by finding
[1:25:19] those that would believe
[1:25:23] &gt;&gt; him. And Abraham believed God. And the
[1:25:28] scripture says, "And it was counted to
[1:25:31] him for righteousness."
[1:25:33] In other words, Abraham believed God and
[1:25:37] God took the attribution of death from
[1:25:40] him and attributed him with
[1:25:42] righteousness and said, "You are as you
[1:25:45] were supposed to be."
[1:25:47] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. You're dying. You're an old
[1:25:49] man. But I I decree that you are as you
[1:25:54] were supposed to be, as you were
[1:25:56] intended to be in my mind, in my
[1:25:59] thoughts.
[1:26:01] &gt;&gt; We'll walk again.
[1:26:03] In the paradise of God.
[1:26:06] &gt;&gt; And all down through the centuries of
[1:26:08] time came people. And God faithfully in
[1:26:13] each generation sending his word for his
[1:26:17] word was his end sign. And the people
[1:26:19] would look upon the end sign and they
[1:26:21] would see the end sign and something
[1:26:23] would move in their heart say that's
[1:26:25] that's my country.
[1:26:30] In this end sign, it spoke.
[1:26:35] &gt;&gt; These flags can't speak. We just have
[1:26:38] something in our heart because our mind
[1:26:41] and our memory and our imagination is
[1:26:43] filled with what it I what it represents
[1:26:46] and we say I'm identified with that
[1:26:48] representation.
[1:26:50] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:26:50] &gt;&gt; But now was another one
[1:26:54] &gt;&gt; and this end sign spoke said I go to
[1:26:57] prepare a place for you. Hallelujah.
[1:26:59] &gt;&gt; That where I am, there you shall be
[1:27:03] also.
[1:27:05] &gt;&gt; This end sign speaks.
[1:27:07] &gt;&gt; This end has a voice.
[1:27:12] &gt;&gt; This ends sign had a secret.
[1:27:15] So, I'm going to hold the secret
[1:27:18] till the very end time when I'm ready to
[1:27:20] call them home to the place that I've
[1:27:23] got ready for them. And then I'm going
[1:27:26] to come myself. I'm going to come. Oh my
[1:27:29] friends, I'm going to be short this
[1:27:31] morning. Even I got so much in my heart.
[1:27:34] But he said, I'm going to hold it. And
[1:27:37] this secret only the lamb himself can
[1:27:40] speak this and can loose it. I'm going
[1:27:42] to I'm going to come to receive them to
[1:27:44] myself. And the prophet says that that
[1:27:47] was the very revelation. That was the
[1:27:48] message in hearing the message and
[1:27:50] receiving it was him receiving you, not
[1:27:53] you receiving him.
[1:27:56] &gt;&gt; Amen. to receive them.
[1:27:58] &gt;&gt; I will come and receive them to myself.
[1:28:01] And that is when you heard his voice.
[1:28:04] &gt;&gt; And he drew you to himself.
[1:28:06] &gt;&gt; He was already receiving you, which is
[1:28:09] part and parcel of his coming.
[1:28:12] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. That's part of his coming.
[1:28:14] People are waiting to say, "Oh, when the
[1:28:17] Lord comes, when the Lord comes, he he
[1:28:19] already has arrived
[1:28:21] &gt;&gt; in word form.
[1:28:24] &gt;&gt; His word coming. to speak the word.
[1:28:28] &gt;&gt; And a group of people will say, "I don't
[1:28:30] believe that. I can't swallow that." But
[1:28:33] there's another one says, "And their ch
[1:28:35] they're Abraham's children by
[1:28:37] attribution."
[1:28:39] &gt;&gt; And they're like their father.
[1:28:41] &gt;&gt; They're like Abraham. I can't understand
[1:28:43] that. I don't understand how my body's
[1:28:45] going to be changed. I don't understand
[1:28:47] how I'm going to bring forth Christ.
[1:28:49] &gt;&gt; I'm so needy.
[1:28:53] &gt;&gt; He knows that.
[1:28:55] But he attributes
[1:28:57] &gt;&gt; his life
[1:28:59] &gt;&gt; by attribution.
[1:29:05] &gt;&gt; I say, is there nothing for us to do? Oh
[1:29:07] yes, of course. But our works,
[1:29:11] our works do not bring us any. I say
[1:29:15] zero righteousness.
[1:29:18] His
[1:29:20] righteousness is because he attributes
[1:29:22] it to you.
[1:29:24] &gt;&gt; Our works is that what we do because he
[1:29:27] has because he has loved us because he
[1:29:31] has saved us. We do it out of love. We
[1:29:33] don't do it out of service. We do it out
[1:29:35] of love.
[1:29:37] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:29:43] Sin
[1:29:46] through an inherent sinful nature
[1:29:49] and death through sin
[1:29:52] passed upon all.
[1:29:55] And now I'm going to read a number of
[1:29:57] scriptures.
[1:29:59] And this if you want to follow along,
[1:30:01] it' be good for you to turn to Romans
[1:30:03] the 5th chapter.
[1:30:12] We start reading at verse 12
[1:30:16] just so it gets really established in
[1:30:19] your heart.
[1:30:21] Wherefore as by one man sin entered into
[1:30:24] the world and death by sin so death
[1:30:28] passed upon all men for that all have
[1:30:33] sinned. For until the law, sin was in
[1:30:37] the world, but sin is not imputed
[1:30:40] when there is no law. Nevertheless,
[1:30:44] death reigned from Adam to Moses, even
[1:30:47] over them that had not sinned after the
[1:30:49] similitude of Adam's transgression, who
[1:30:52] is the figure of him that was to come.
[1:30:57] But not as the offense, so also is the
[1:31:00] free gift. For if through the offense of
[1:31:03] one many be dead, understand that. For
[1:31:08] if through the offense of one, many be
[1:31:11] dead, the many are dead by attribution.
[1:31:14] They did not sin as as the original
[1:31:17] parent did. Much more the grace of God,
[1:31:21] and the gift of by grace, which is by
[1:31:25] one man, Jesus Christ, hath abounded
[1:31:28] unto many, and not as it was by one that
[1:31:33] sinned, and not as it was by one that
[1:31:36] sinned, so is the gift. For the judgment
[1:31:40] was by one to condemnation, but the free
[1:31:43] gift is to many offenses unto
[1:31:47] justification. And the people could say,
[1:31:50] "Amen."
[1:31:51] For if by one man's offense death
[1:31:54] reigned by one, see, death became king,
[1:31:57] much more they which receive abundance
[1:32:01] of grace and of the gift of
[1:32:03] righteousness shall reign in life by one
[1:32:07] Jesus Christ. Therefore, as by the
[1:32:10] offense by of one, judgment came upon
[1:32:14] all men to condemnation,
[1:32:18] even so by the righteousness of one, the
[1:32:22] free gift came upon all men unto
[1:32:26] justification of life. Hallelujah.
[1:32:30] &gt;&gt; Oh, we want to say grace is king.
[1:32:35] &gt;&gt; Let's say it together. Grace is king.
[1:32:38] Amen.
[1:32:39] &gt;&gt; King of my life, I crown thee now my
[1:32:43] thine that let the the the glory be king
[1:32:46] of my life. Grace this morning is king.
[1:32:52] &gt;&gt; Remember that
[1:32:54] &gt;&gt; not condemnation is king. Not death is
[1:32:56] king. You say well I am dying. I am
[1:32:59] getting older. But grace is king
[1:33:02] &gt;&gt; because who is greater? The one who
[1:33:05] brought the offense or the one who
[1:33:06] brought the free gift? the grace. He's
[1:33:09] the great one.
[1:33:13] &gt;&gt; And one more verse,
[1:33:16] verse 21. Now, that as sin hath reigned
[1:33:20] unto death, even so might grace reign
[1:33:24] through righteousness unto eternal life
[1:33:27] by Jesus Christ our Lord. And to reign,
[1:33:32] I say grace is king, but to reign. It is
[1:33:37] not only to be king, but to exercise
[1:33:40] kingly power, to exercise the highest
[1:33:43] influence. There was a time, and you
[1:33:45] know what? There are people who say they
[1:33:47] are believers, say they are Christians,
[1:33:50] but condemnation reigns in them.
[1:33:57] And I'm not surprised that you're here
[1:34:00] this morning.
[1:34:02] And you live with condemnation.
[1:34:06] You can never tell me that condemnation
[1:34:08] makes you feel and have a sense, well, I
[1:34:11] just want to worship God. I just want to
[1:34:14] serve him. Condemnation doesn't do that.
[1:34:16] Condemnation drives you down. Drives you
[1:34:19] down. And I can tell you that Satan is
[1:34:22] filled with glee when he sees you under
[1:34:25] condemnation. And death is king.
[1:34:28] Condemnation which came by death which
[1:34:30] comes by this this uh foul enemy.
[1:34:33] Condemnation's a real thing.
[1:34:37] You c you cannot find manic depression
[1:34:40] in the Bible. But you can find
[1:34:42] condemnation in the Bible and all of
[1:34:45] these nice terms that they have. And
[1:34:47] they have uh medicinal uh you know uh
[1:34:51] the pharmacy the local pharmacy can give
[1:34:54] you something the local doctor can
[1:34:56] prescribe something for for this
[1:34:58] depression. I got a name for depression.
[1:35:01] The letter is still D and it's called
[1:35:03] the devil.
[1:35:04] &gt;&gt; It is the devil. The prophet says you
[1:35:07] may call it cancer. That's a name you
[1:35:09] give it. It is a devil. And I respect I
[1:35:13] respect with all my heart not just what
[1:35:16] a man was saying said brother Brandham
[1:35:17] said that to me he represented
[1:35:21] he represented and spoke a word that for
[1:35:24] my part is the end sign in the end time.
[1:35:28] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:35:30] &gt;&gt; And unless you are prepared to hold that
[1:35:34] end sign up I mean you you should be
[1:35:37] prepared.
[1:35:42] Even more so than the brave Marines on
[1:35:45] Ewaima. You should be more prepared
[1:35:48] whatever the cost and whatever it takes
[1:35:51] and whatever resource, whatever energy,
[1:35:54] I have a loyalty in my heart to this one
[1:35:57] who's I'm on Calvary.
[1:36:00] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And my allegiance goes to
[1:36:02] him. Amen.
[1:36:05] &gt;&gt; And if that's not in your heart, sir,
[1:36:08] &gt;&gt; it's a hypocrisy to say I'm a Christian.
[1:36:12] &gt;&gt; We're not riding along on easy street
[1:36:15] just to be identified. I'm identified
[1:36:17] with Bible way. You can go straight to
[1:36:20] hell with that.
[1:36:21] &gt;&gt; People say I'm identified with
[1:36:23] Christianity. You can go straight to
[1:36:25] hell still with that on your lips. But
[1:36:29] when you say God has spoken, God has
[1:36:32] sent his word. God has confirmed his
[1:36:34] word. God has clearly identified that
[1:36:37] this is of him
[1:36:39] &gt;&gt; that he sent this.
[1:36:43] &gt;&gt; I say, who did this vindication?
[1:36:46] &gt;&gt; Who did this vindication
[1:36:49] &gt;&gt; in this message? Who vindicated this
[1:36:51] message?
[1:36:55] &gt;&gt; I wouldn't advise you to do this, but I
[1:36:57] have done it.
[1:36:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:36:59] I've sat with people that were
[1:37:02] antagonistic
[1:37:04] against the servant of God, against the
[1:37:07] prophet of God, against his ministry,
[1:37:09] against his message.
[1:37:12] And when I get right into that tight
[1:37:14] tight time, when they're so opposed to
[1:37:16] it,
[1:37:18] I say to them, and I have said it on
[1:37:21] occasion, but I don't recommend unless
[1:37:23] you've been fully led by the Holy Spirit
[1:37:26] to do so, but I felt I was led. And I
[1:37:28] said, "Well, then say that he was of the
[1:37:33] devil.
[1:37:36] Say that this message is of Satan."
[1:37:40] And they become silent.
[1:37:42] And I don't let them go. Brother Ernie,
[1:37:44] I said, "Say say it. I want you to say
[1:37:47] it.
[1:37:48] Go ahead and say it. Say this message is
[1:37:51] of the devil and say this ministry is of
[1:37:54] the devil and say that he was of the
[1:37:55] devil
[1:37:57] and their own silence condemns them.
[1:38:00] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:38:05] &gt;&gt; They may be very religious and they'll
[1:38:07] tangle and antagonistic against it, but
[1:38:10] they're afraid.
[1:38:13] &gt;&gt; But this prophet wasn't afraid to say,
[1:38:15] "Your denomination is of the devil.
[1:38:18] your denomination came from Rome.
[1:38:21] &gt;&gt; It was birthed at Naa and it's of the
[1:38:24] devil.
[1:38:27] &gt;&gt; He wasn't afraid to say what was of
[1:38:29] Satan. And I say today uh before this
[1:38:33] end sign that's been lifted up in this
[1:38:35] end time, this vindication was none
[1:38:37] other than God himself.
[1:38:40] &gt;&gt; That's why he said he's a mighty God
[1:38:42] unveiled.
[1:38:44] Not veiled, not hidden, unveiled.
[1:38:48] &gt;&gt; Why unveiled? So the people would be
[1:38:50] forced to look at it.
[1:38:53] &gt;&gt; This cross that hung on Mount Calvary on
[1:38:56] that rock pile called Gol Gotha. And he
[1:38:59] the prophet said that day the mercy seat
[1:39:03] which was always hidden in the in the
[1:39:05] holy of holies of the tabernacle. But
[1:39:08] this day God pulled the veil off
[1:39:11] &gt;&gt; and he hung there. He said the mercy
[1:39:14] seat was fully exposed.
[1:39:19] &gt;&gt; And the Bible says they walked by.
[1:39:23] People who never were able to see the
[1:39:26] mercy seat
[1:39:28] &gt;&gt; walked by
[1:39:30] &gt;&gt; and looked on the mercy seat in full
[1:39:33] view
[1:39:35] &gt;&gt; and Bible says they wagged their heads.
[1:39:38] &gt;&gt; They thought it was such a failure. They
[1:39:40] thought it was such a a loss. He was a
[1:39:44] good man. He was a great teacher. What a
[1:39:46] shame.
[1:39:49] &gt;&gt; And there was God when they thought all
[1:39:53] they thought the whole system was
[1:39:54] collapsing. There was God taking off the
[1:39:58] veil and the seals
[1:40:00] &gt;&gt; and say it's in full view.
[1:40:02] &gt;&gt; The mercy seat's in full view.
[1:40:06] God's end sign was hanging on Calvary on
[1:40:10] another pole. Not Ewima, Mount Goltha.
[1:40:19] &gt;&gt; There came another mountain called Mount
[1:40:21] Sunset
[1:40:23] &gt;&gt; and a redeemed son,
[1:40:25] &gt;&gt; a saved, a born again, a redeemed son
[1:40:28] had come to maturity.
[1:40:31] Said, "Now the time has come. a sworn
[1:40:34] affidavit to the people.
[1:40:37] &gt;&gt; And a sworn affidavit is a legal
[1:40:39] document absolutely binding. Not by some
[1:40:44] attorney or not by your attorney or your
[1:40:47] lawyer, not by that, but by God himself.
[1:40:51] &gt;&gt; Says, "I bind myself to this word." And
[1:40:54] he descended with one foot upon the land
[1:40:57] and one foot that was amongst the
[1:40:59] people.
[1:41:00] &gt;&gt; The land and the sea identify the
[1:41:02] people. He came down amongst the people.
[1:41:06] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:41:08] &gt;&gt; My goodness. And declared, "This is a
[1:41:10] legal binding document."
[1:41:13] &gt;&gt; And I have a servant on earth that's
[1:41:15] been proven and tested. And everything
[1:41:17] that he spoke has been true, true, true.
[1:41:20] &gt;&gt; This is the spirit of truth.
[1:41:22] &gt;&gt; He is my ordained vessel, predestinated
[1:41:25] at the last messenger. And now I give to
[1:41:28] the people my binding document
[1:41:32] &gt;&gt; and I raise up for them
[1:41:35] &gt;&gt; the end sign
[1:41:37] &gt;&gt; once again
[1:41:40] &gt;&gt; and they still walk by sir
[1:41:44] &gt;&gt; wag their heads
[1:41:46] nice
[1:41:48] they're nice people kind of funny
[1:41:52] got some strange ideas
[1:41:55] but I like them they're nice. He was a
[1:41:58] good man.
[1:42:00] It's a nice message.
[1:42:04] But they have not the wherewithal
[1:42:06] to understand
[1:42:09] the legal document, the seals,
[1:42:13] &gt;&gt; unveiled,
[1:42:15] &gt;&gt; and the mercy seats in plain view for
[1:42:18] all to see.
[1:42:19] &gt;&gt; Not a flag on Euima. Not with a few
[1:42:23] thousand men laying dead around the
[1:42:26] cross. One man
[1:42:28] &gt;&gt; on the cross. One man. I say one man.
[1:42:32] &gt;&gt; And he's the same yesterday,
[1:42:35] &gt;&gt; today, and forever.
[1:42:38] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Our end sign stands before
[1:42:41] us today.
[1:42:43] &gt;&gt; To me, it's glorious.
[1:42:46] When you see this picture of the
[1:42:48] bleeding figure, something, oh my, their
[1:42:51] emotions get but my emotions just go
[1:42:53] screaming out. Oh, how glorious is that?
[1:42:57] How glorious is this scene?
[1:43:04] &gt;&gt; I don't even feel like I'm preaching to
[1:43:06] you this morning. I'm just having my own
[1:43:08] relationship with him.
[1:43:11] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. I've taken put my arms
[1:43:14] around that cross for the one that hung
[1:43:16] there as my end sign in the end time.
[1:43:21] I'm identified with him. I'm represented
[1:43:24] with him with all of its shame and all
[1:43:27] of its glory.
[1:43:31] &gt;&gt; My end sign came out of the tomb. My end
[1:43:35] sign corruption couldn't take him. My
[1:43:38] end sign. This stone couldn't hold him.
[1:43:43] Hallelujah.
[1:43:44] My end sign.
[1:43:48] &gt;&gt; Oh, I pledge allegiance to him.
[1:43:51] Hallelujah.
[1:43:53] What about you young people? Is he worth
[1:43:54] your youth? Is he worth your strength?
[1:43:57] Is he worth your energy? Is he worth
[1:43:59] your beauty? Young ladies, what is he
[1:44:01] worth? He's worth it all.
[1:44:07] Is he worth your job?
[1:44:08] &gt;&gt; Is he worth your business?
[1:44:10] &gt;&gt; What's he worth?
[1:44:13] &gt;&gt; Everything.
[1:44:15] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. He's worth everything.
[1:44:18] &gt;&gt; These boys said it was worth everything.
[1:44:20] &gt;&gt; They said it's worth it.
[1:44:22] &gt;&gt; This rock pile is worth it.
[1:44:25] &gt;&gt; We're going to drag this flag up these
[1:44:27] several hundred feet. It's worth it.
[1:44:33] It is worth it.
[1:44:44] We couldn't do a lot for it
[1:44:51] because of our
[1:44:55] weakness of this flesh
[1:44:58] which came by attribution.
[1:45:01] I tell you in all honesty, if you would
[1:45:04] to ask me, brother Ed, is your flesh
[1:45:07] weak? Everybody's flesh is weak. Mine is
[1:45:10] weak. The prophet says his biggest
[1:45:14] biggest problem was himself.
[1:45:16] William Brandham, your biggest problem
[1:45:18] is yourself.
[1:45:20] &gt;&gt; And you got that by attribution. The
[1:45:22] flesh is weak. It was weak yesterday.
[1:45:24] It's weak today. It'll be weak tomorrow.
[1:45:27] Don't say, "I'll serve him when my flesh
[1:45:29] gets strong." That doesn't work. Let Let
[1:45:32] grace come to you by attribution.
[1:45:35] The free gift. The free gift. Say it.
[1:45:38] The free gift. Say it again. The free
[1:45:40] gift.
[1:45:44] &gt;&gt; He saw you bankrupt. He saw you as you
[1:45:47] have nothing. He said you can never do
[1:45:49] it. You can never live the life. You can
[1:45:51] never have it. I'm going to deposit it
[1:45:53] in your account.
[1:45:56] &gt;&gt; You can't earn it. You can't buy it.
[1:46:00] I'm going to deposit it in your account
[1:46:04] &gt;&gt; and I'm going to reckon.
[1:46:06] &gt;&gt; I'm going to impute to you righteousness
[1:46:10] &gt;&gt; and I will not impute your sin.
[1:46:14] &gt;&gt; You say, "Well, is this kind of a loose
[1:46:16] arrangement of grace?" Not at all.
[1:46:19] &gt;&gt; Before that happens, you have to
[1:46:20] believe.
[1:46:22] &gt;&gt; When you believe,
[1:46:24] &gt;&gt; he does it.
[1:46:25] when you believe.
[1:46:27] &gt;&gt; Oh, it's so simple.
[1:46:29] &gt;&gt; People make it so complicated, but it's
[1:46:31] so simple.
[1:46:32] &gt;&gt; We're having a baptismal tonight.
[1:46:36] The brother of baptizing,
[1:46:38] one of our native brothers from Canada.
[1:46:41] He spent about four years in the
[1:46:43] Marines,
[1:46:45] Terry Thomas.
[1:46:48] He's going to be baptized tonight.
[1:46:52] I'm sure when he saw the flag going up
[1:46:55] in Euima, something moved in his heart.
[1:46:58] That was a Marine. Brother Gary St. John
[1:47:02] was a Marine. Something moves in their
[1:47:04] heart when they see old glory
[1:47:07] raised up. But in this day,
[1:47:11] in this day, something moves in my
[1:47:14] heart. I see him raised up before the
[1:47:18] people. Amen.
[1:47:19] &gt;&gt; And that why you see the prophet, the
[1:47:21] prophet, I tell you what, he was so
[1:47:23] moved. He was so moved by his beauty
[1:47:27] when he saw him raised up. He saw the
[1:47:29] message being raised up. And I can see
[1:47:31] as it were his hands on that pole,
[1:47:35] raising it up so the raising up high on
[1:47:39] the hill so the people can see. The
[1:47:42] people can see far. It'll go far and
[1:47:45] wide. and he knew there'd be a company
[1:47:47] of people.
[1:47:49] I I I'm amazed sometime when he'd be
[1:47:52] speaking to just a handful of people and
[1:47:54] he said, "These tapes go to the jungles.
[1:47:58] These tapes go around the world."
[1:48:01] &gt;&gt; He saw there would be people that would
[1:48:03] come and they would be gathered.
[1:48:05] &gt;&gt; When I saw those flags go by on the
[1:48:07] screen and as the brothers were putting
[1:48:09] it together and I was going over them
[1:48:11] and saying, "Don't forget this country.
[1:48:14] Don't forget that country. and we see
[1:48:16] our flag go up there. Some may feel a
[1:48:19] sense I I need to, you know, I need to
[1:48:22] salute. I need to stand. I need to put
[1:48:25] my hand up across my heart. But I am
[1:48:28] raising up for you today an end sign.
[1:48:32] The one that was on Calvary, but the one
[1:48:34] that is here now, the one that's been
[1:48:36] raised up in this end time. And I trust
[1:48:39] that he becomes so visible to you in
[1:48:41] word form that you say, "I give my all.
[1:48:44] I give my all. I believe it with all my
[1:48:47] heart. I don't understand it, but I
[1:48:50] believe it with everything in me.
[1:48:53] &gt;&gt; And the life, the life from that end
[1:48:56] sign, either I'm a liar or this is the
[1:48:59] truth of God's word. The life from that
[1:49:01] end sign will come into you and dwell in
[1:49:05] you and make you make you one with it.
[1:49:11] We can stand before a flag and say what
[1:49:15] it is. I am.
[1:49:17] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:49:17] &gt;&gt; I'm identified with everything. I'm
[1:49:20] identified with it shame. I'm identified
[1:49:22] with this glory. I was there at the
[1:49:25] Boston Tea Party. I was there with
[1:49:26] George Washington. I was there. And yet
[1:49:29] it all has to be imagined.
[1:49:32] &gt;&gt; But this identification doesn't have to
[1:49:34] be imagined. This identification is a
[1:49:37] reality.
[1:49:40] &gt;&gt; This identification is the same spirit
[1:49:43] &gt;&gt; that was in him comes into you.
[1:49:49] &gt;&gt; Do you believe it?
[1:49:53] &gt;&gt; We are one
[1:49:55] &gt;&gt; with him.
[1:49:57] &gt;&gt; And God is dealing with you and speaking
[1:49:59] to you. I would take about one tenth of
[1:50:02] one second to respond to it. I wouldn't
[1:50:05] I wouldn't wait and say, "Well, I'm
[1:50:06] drafted and I'm pulled and I'm trained
[1:50:09] before I come up to my this mountain." I
[1:50:13] would say, "No, I'm going to come. I
[1:50:14] give my life. I surrender all that I am
[1:50:17] to him right now."
[1:50:23] &gt;&gt; And he will pass upon you,
[1:50:26] &gt;&gt; not death,
[1:50:29] but his righteousness.
[1:50:32] all of his righteousness.
[1:50:36] &gt;&gt; You didn't get half of Adam's
[1:50:37] transgression
[1:50:39] &gt;&gt; in this flesh. You didn't get half of
[1:50:41] the penalty. You're not half dying. You
[1:50:45] are dying.
[1:50:48] Not long after you're born, you start to
[1:50:50] die.
[1:50:53] And if times should go on, we all
[1:50:56] perhaps from different countries,
[1:50:58] different cultures, different
[1:50:59] backgrounds, we'll all find common
[1:51:02] ground. And it's on a slab
[1:51:04] in a mortuary
[1:51:06] or someplace.
[1:51:08] I can tell you friends, for the
[1:51:10] believer, that's why you're here.
[1:51:14] &gt;&gt; I will not be in that slab, and neither
[1:51:16] will you. By God's grace, by a gift, by
[1:51:19] the free gift, I will be another place.
[1:51:22] I will be I'll be watching them say like
[1:51:25] brother uh our
[1:51:28] brother brother Mark and brother
[1:51:30] Ricard's grandfather
[1:51:32] who passed away in a hospital after an
[1:51:35] operation and I sat with him while he
[1:51:38] told me what took place and how after
[1:51:42] his the nurse said to the wife sister
[1:51:47] uh just forget her name just now but he
[1:51:50] said to her Brother Duply, brother Con,
[1:51:54] Brother Dupy, he said to her, "Go, go,
[1:51:57] go, go. You need to go."
[1:52:02] And she was working with the tubes in
[1:52:04] his throat and one of the tubes had come
[1:52:07] against a part of his body and he wasn't
[1:52:11] able to get any air and he died right
[1:52:13] there. He wasn't dead for a few moments.
[1:52:16] He was dead for between 12 and 15
[1:52:18] minutes.
[1:52:19] So the brain is completely gone.
[1:52:23] While his wife stood on the other side
[1:52:24] of the bed, he watched the tears form in
[1:52:27] her eyes, described it to the letter.
[1:52:31] And the nurse, he saw the nurse working
[1:52:34] with the tubes in his throat.
[1:52:37] And he stood there. He said about the
[1:52:39] height of the door. And he watched her.
[1:52:43] And he thought, if this is death,
[1:52:47] this is nothing to be afraid of. If this
[1:52:49] is death,
[1:52:51] wonderful brother, wonderful, one of the
[1:52:53] most lovely believers I have ever met,
[1:52:57] trustee in brother Ratif's church.
[1:53:00] And says, and and when he got to a
[1:53:02] certain point, he said he couldn't know
[1:53:03] anymore. He said to his wife, "You you
[1:53:06] know, you have to fill in your part."
[1:53:09] And when the nurse says, "You leave now.
[1:53:11] You must leave." She stepped out into
[1:53:14] the passageway of the hospital and one
[1:53:17] of her two daughters, one of the
[1:53:19] mothers, either Rickart's or or Marco's
[1:53:24] mother, was in the hall
[1:53:26] and said, "Come quick. Daddy's leaving
[1:53:29] us." And she had written, I think, on
[1:53:33] her hand the number of the doctor's cell
[1:53:37] phone or automobile phone's mobile
[1:53:40] phone. And she went quickly to the pay
[1:53:43] phone and called the doctor and said
[1:53:46] said uh duplic duply emergency duplic
[1:53:51] operation emergency and he's on the
[1:53:53] freeway already has left the hospital
[1:53:56] he's miles away on the freeway and at
[1:53:58] that moment friends nothing s nothing
[1:54:01] happens by accident at that moment the
[1:54:03] other attending physician was going on
[1:54:06] the freeway and he motioned to him like
[1:54:08] this to go back go back And they both
[1:54:11] turned around and came back.
[1:54:14] Brother Duplo
[1:54:16] saw the doctor get out of his car and he
[1:54:20] even had some difficulty with the car
[1:54:22] getting out or whatever it was or or
[1:54:24] locking it or something. He described
[1:54:26] the whole scene. He's in a brick
[1:54:28] building.
[1:54:30] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:54:31] &gt;&gt; That's the body I want.
[1:54:35] &gt;&gt; Described the whole thing. And the
[1:54:36] doctor comes running down the
[1:54:38] passageway. And while he's running, he's
[1:54:40] throwing his coat off. And the nurse is
[1:54:43] standing going like this.
[1:54:46] Don't don't don't hurry yourself. Don't
[1:54:48] bother yourself. He's already gone. And
[1:54:52] the next thing Brother Dupy knows, he
[1:54:55] just comes to Sister Dupy is patting his
[1:54:57] cheek, saying, "Lovey, lovey,
[1:55:01] lovey." Patting his cheek like that, and
[1:55:04] he just comes alive. He says, he says to
[1:55:07] me after that, he says,
[1:55:09] Brother Ed. Brother Eddie. He calls me
[1:55:11] Brother Eddie. He says, "I'm better now.
[1:55:14] I feel like I'm 21 again."
[1:55:17] &gt;&gt; And he still lives tonight.
[1:55:20] &gt;&gt; What a testimony.
[1:55:22] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:55:23] &gt;&gt; And the prophet went beyond the curtain
[1:55:25] of time said in one place said, "I saw
[1:55:29] you all there."
[1:55:31] &gt;&gt; Oh, I hope he saw me.
[1:55:33] &gt;&gt; Saw millions of people.
[1:55:36] &gt;&gt; Is this a fairy tale? This is reality.
[1:55:39] &gt;&gt; And if it's not it, we're living a fairy
[1:55:41] tale down here. This is a passing human
[1:55:44] parade.
[1:55:48] &gt;&gt; Do you like what you see?
[1:55:51] &gt;&gt; Do you like what you see on the street
[1:55:55] &gt;&gt; in a sad place?
[1:55:57] Trouble everywhere. And I won't measure
[1:56:00] on that. I'm done. I'm done preaching.
[1:56:03] But there is a land.
[1:56:06] There's a land
[1:56:08] &gt;&gt; and my my end sign represents that land.
[1:56:13] &gt;&gt; My end sign, the life of my end sign
[1:56:16] represents everything that my soul cries
[1:56:18] for.
[1:56:19] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:56:20] &gt;&gt; I love that life.
[1:56:22] &gt;&gt; Glory to God.
[1:56:23] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:56:24] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:56:24] &gt;&gt; We love everything he represents.
[1:56:26] &gt;&gt; And I'm I'm proud. I'm happy to be
[1:56:30] identified with its failure.
[1:56:31] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:56:32] &gt;&gt; What the world considers a failure. What
[1:56:34] the world considers a shame, they think
[1:56:36] it's a shame.
[1:56:39] &gt;&gt; Many in the world think that you sisters
[1:56:41] are so oppressed.
[1:56:43] &gt;&gt; I glory in it.
[1:56:46] &gt;&gt; They think our men are so deprived. I
[1:56:48] glory in it.
[1:56:50] &gt;&gt; So, oh, you have such talent and you
[1:56:51] have such this and you could do this and
[1:56:53] you could do that. We're not interested
[1:56:55] in it. We're not interested in that.
[1:56:57] We're not interested in the biggest
[1:56:59] church. We're not interested in that
[1:57:00] stuff. We're interested in what the
[1:57:02] kingdom. Well, what's right for the
[1:57:04] kingdom? What's right for my country?
[1:57:10] &gt;&gt; Are you with me?
[1:57:12] &gt;&gt; Am I just using up a bunch of energy
[1:57:13] today or is this touching your soul?
[1:57:24] &gt;&gt; I close with this.
[1:57:27] It's not a flag.
[1:57:30] It's a life,
[1:57:34] &gt;&gt; not a flag.
[1:57:37] And let us not have men
[1:57:41] and women who've devoted their lives to
[1:57:44] fight for their country put you and I to
[1:57:48] shame
[1:57:49] with the allegiance that they have for a
[1:57:53] country that is passing off the scene.
[1:57:58] And you and I that are sitting here, let
[1:58:01] us not be put to shame by men and women
[1:58:03] who belong to some denomination or some
[1:58:05] organization and they will just serve
[1:58:08] that thing just night and day. I urge
[1:58:11] you with all that's in me. Give your
[1:58:13] best
[1:58:15] &gt;&gt; to this kingdom, to this end sign that
[1:58:19] is raised up in this end time.
[1:58:23] And I'll close with this.
[1:58:26] In 1962
[1:58:29] in Phoenix, I believe it was, Brother
[1:58:31] Brandon preached an end sign
[1:58:35] and he just what the end sign was
[1:58:40] and what it is today and who it is. He
[1:58:44] preached on the end sign. He says, "I've
[1:58:45] lifted up before you." And he calls the
[1:58:48] people to prove that that was our end
[1:58:52] sign. And he tells one after the other
[1:58:55] after the other after the other the
[1:58:58] supernatural truth of vindication so
[1:59:00] that we could sit here today and say,
[1:59:02] "Oh God,
[1:59:04] &gt;&gt; how wonderful it is.
[1:59:06] &gt;&gt; It's without error,
[1:59:09] &gt;&gt; without a mistake.
[1:59:11] &gt;&gt; It's truth."
[1:59:13] &gt;&gt; My end sign.
[1:59:15] &gt;&gt; I don't care which flag came up today.
[1:59:17] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:59:17] &gt;&gt; I don't care which flag you're
[1:59:19] represented with. There isn't a man or
[1:59:22] woman in the right mind that can stand
[1:59:24] up and say my flag represents truth.
[1:59:30] &gt;&gt; It doesn't
[1:59:32] &gt;&gt; the you can put the best men the best
[1:59:35] women in the government but the there's
[1:59:37] a system will corrupt them.
[1:59:41] Even the prophet said that even men that
[1:59:44] go into the priesthood or a nun that
[1:59:46] goes to be a nun and cloister
[1:59:48] themselves, he said they don't go there
[1:59:50] to be bad people. They go there to be
[1:59:52] good people. But the system corrupts
[1:59:55] them.
[1:59:57] &gt;&gt; Politics corrupt the people. Politics in
[2:00:00] the church corrupts people. We're not
[2:00:02] interested in politics. We're interested
[2:00:04] in truth. But I can point to my end
[2:00:07] sign. My Christ is lifted up. I can say
[2:00:11] he is truth, all truth. There's no error
[2:00:15] in him. There's no weakness in him.
[2:00:18] There's no frailty in him.
[2:00:21] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:00:22] &gt;&gt; He deserves
[2:00:23] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:00:24] &gt;&gt; your all.
[2:00:26] &gt;&gt; Your all. And I would urge you today
[2:00:29] &gt;&gt; to give him your all.
[2:00:32] &gt;&gt; And don't hesitate.
[2:00:33] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:00:34] &gt;&gt; Give him your all. I wonder if we could
[2:00:36] stand and sing.
[2:00:38] I pledge allegiance
[2:00:40] to the lamb.
[2:00:42] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:00:48] &gt;&gt; I pray that you'll be able to sing it
[2:00:50] different.
[2:00:52] [Music]
[2:00:54] If you know the words, you may want to
[2:00:56] just close your eyes.
[2:01:00] And if you can't sing it,
[2:01:03] you may want to come here
[2:01:06] and we'll pray with you till you can
[2:01:08] sing it.
[2:01:11] Dear friends,
[2:01:15] my brothers and sisters,
[2:01:17] [Music]
[2:01:19] is a serious moment.
[2:01:22] You know as well as I know you're
[2:01:25] passing from this scene.
[2:01:28] We're just crossing the little stage of
[2:01:30] life.
[2:01:32] [Music]
[2:01:33] And when you take your last breath,
[2:01:38] I want to ask what then? It's a
[2:01:41] songwriter. What then? Where will you
[2:01:44] be?
[2:01:46] What will it be then?
[2:01:49] Whatever you do, don't leave this
[2:01:51] service. be disappointment to me if you
[2:01:54] leave this service and say really spoke
[2:01:57] deep to me really spoke deep but I for
[2:02:00] one reason or another I just couldn't
[2:02:01] make that step I couldn't make that move
[2:02:04] I couldn't make that consecration
[2:02:09] what about tomorrow you don't know about
[2:02:11] tomorrow anyway leave it in God's hands
[2:02:13] this is now right here now
[2:02:17] I pledge allegiance
[2:02:20] to the lamb not the flag of life.
[2:02:22] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:02:24] &gt;&gt; I pray now the Holy Spirit
[2:02:27] come and take over in this meeting.
[2:02:30] Do all manner of
[2:02:33] marvelous victories amongst us. Oh God.
[2:02:37] Oh God. Oh God. We've so rejoiced in
[2:02:41] what you have done in the recent year
[2:02:45] year that we've just passed through. But
[2:02:47] now we're looking for greater victories,
[2:02:49] oh God. even greater victories. Come, oh
[2:02:53] Holy Spirit.
[2:02:55] &gt;&gt; Brood upon this congregation. Let every
[2:02:58] man and woman that believes this word
[2:03:00] pray with me. Brood upon this
[2:03:03] congregation, Lord. Brood upon our
[2:03:05] hearts. Move us, Father. Move the enemy
[2:03:09] out of the camp.
[2:03:12] [Music]
[2:03:13] &gt;&gt; Break his power, oh God. break his hold.
[2:03:19] &gt;&gt; The name of Jesus, lovely one. In the
[2:03:23] name of my Lord Jesus,
[2:03:29] I pledge
[2:03:32] alrenor
[2:03:35] [Music]
[2:03:52] is
[2:03:56] our
[2:03:58] [Music]
[2:04:05] course once again
[2:04:09] [Music]
[2:04:16] with all my strength.
[2:04:21] With all I am, I will sing
[2:04:27] to
[2:04:30] his
[2:04:31] command.
[2:04:34] [Music]
[2:04:44] Before we sing it, just once again, and
[2:04:46] while we sing it, I want you to take
[2:04:50] Take inventory,
[2:04:52] a mental inventory of your life,
[2:04:55] where you're at at this moment.
[2:04:58] We're starting a new year.
[2:05:02] Will it be just a repeat of last year?
[2:05:05] Or will it be different? Will it be
[2:05:07] different? You might say, "Well, I don't
[2:05:09] have the strength." That's not what I'm
[2:05:11] asking you.
[2:05:13] I don't have the ability. That's not
[2:05:14] what I'm asking you.
[2:05:17] I'm asking you, are you willing?
[2:05:19] &gt;&gt; Are you just willing? Are you just
[2:05:22] willing?
[2:05:24] Are you willing? Is this congregation
[2:05:26] willing?
[2:05:28] &gt;&gt; God bless you.
[2:05:31] God bless you.
[2:05:36] I pledge
[2:05:38] &gt;&gt; al
[2:05:42] [Music]
[2:05:44] with all my strength
[2:05:49] with all I am. I will seek
[2:05:55] to honor
[2:05:58] his
[2:05:59] command.
[2:06:01] I
[2:06:04] [Music]
[2:06:12] &gt;&gt; first I have heard
[2:06:16] how
[2:06:18] long
[2:06:22] were
[2:06:23] [Music]
[2:06:29] They were told
[2:06:32] that we would spend
[2:06:36] their lives.
[2:06:40] [Music]
[2:06:45] &gt;&gt; Oh, but one by one
[2:06:51] to
[2:06:54] the son of God.
[2:06:57] They will not
[2:07:03] [Music]
[2:07:09] I can
[2:07:13] there
[2:07:16] [Music]
[2:07:25] we All my strength
[2:07:30] and all
[2:07:33] I will see
[2:07:35] to
[2:07:38] his
[2:07:40] command.
[2:07:42] I pledge
[2:07:46] to
[2:07:52] and the years have come and the years
[2:07:59] have gone.
[2:08:03] [Music]
[2:08:05] &gt;&gt; It still
[2:08:07] goes on now.
[2:08:10] The time has come
[2:08:13] to
[2:08:14] &gt;&gt; the cost to reject.
[2:08:18] &gt;&gt; We'll make it more than a song, Lord.
[2:08:23] &gt;&gt; The cost.
[2:08:28] &gt;&gt; Let us live our lives
[2:08:32] for the one who died
[2:08:36] to give us life.
[2:08:39] Good
[2:08:42] sound.
[2:08:47] Let us proudly stand
[2:08:52] and
[2:08:54] sing.
[2:08:57] [Applause]
[2:08:58] Alance
[2:09:00] to
[2:09:02] the lamb.
[2:09:04] With all my strength,
[2:09:08] with all I am, I will see
[2:09:14] to all
[2:09:16] his
[2:09:18] command.
[2:09:20] I pledge allegiance
[2:09:24] to
[2:09:27] the lamb to the lamb of God. to the lamb
[2:09:33] of God.
[2:09:35] Who bore my pain?
[2:09:39] Who took my place?
[2:09:43] You my
[2:09:47] shamb.
[2:09:48] [Music]
[2:10:05] &gt;&gt; I want to sing that verse again.
[2:10:08] And when we come to who bore my pain, a
[2:10:13] lot more than our pain he bore. He bore
[2:10:15] our stain.
[2:10:17] I was stained. I was marked. You were
[2:10:19] marked
[2:10:21] by the transgression of Adam. It passed
[2:10:23] upon you. And death passed upon you.
[2:10:27] And time shall go on. My words will be
[2:10:30] proven true.
[2:10:33] There'll be more services take place in
[2:10:35] this church perhaps. with a wooden box
[2:10:38] here.
[2:10:42] If it so happens I have to go the way of
[2:10:44] death and you see my casket here, I want
[2:10:47] to make this declaration before that
[2:10:49] happens. I want to go down in a blaze of
[2:10:52] fire.
[2:10:54] &gt;&gt; I want to go down and someone that if I
[2:10:57] see these boys on Ewima, I see Christ on
[2:11:00] Calvary and he just demands everything.
[2:11:02] He demands my all. Everything you can
[2:11:04] do, everything you can be. Amen.
[2:11:06] &gt;&gt; Does he not?
[2:11:08] &gt;&gt; Am I alone? No, I'm not alone.
[2:11:11] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:11:12] &gt;&gt; I know that God is
[2:11:13] &gt;&gt; gripping your heart. How many are
[2:11:15] resolved?
[2:11:16] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:11:18] &gt;&gt; Brother Ed, I'm resolved. Want to see
[2:11:20] you young people raise your hand. I'm
[2:11:21] resolved. Want to see right here at the
[2:11:23] front. Want to see you young people
[2:11:25] doing everything that you can.
[2:11:29] &gt;&gt; Your spirit, your whole will,
[2:11:31] &gt;&gt; your whole mind, your strength.
[2:11:34] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:11:35] I call this church to dedication.
[2:11:38] Dedicate yourself
[2:11:40] &gt;&gt; body, soul, and spirit.
[2:11:43] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:11:45] &gt;&gt; Glory to God.
[2:11:49] &gt;&gt; To the lamb of God.
[2:11:55] [Music]
[2:12:00] &gt;&gt; Your place. and my shame.
[2:12:03] &gt;&gt; Lord, you're saved.
[2:12:05] &gt;&gt; I will seek to seek,
[2:12:09] &gt;&gt; seek to obey.
[2:12:11] Just come out.
[2:12:13] [Music]
[2:12:21] &gt;&gt; To the lamb. Once again to the lamb of
[2:12:26] God
[2:12:32] who my face
[2:12:35] and my shame
[2:12:39] I will sing
[2:12:41] to
[2:12:43] his
[2:12:48] [Music]
[2:12:51] to
[2:12:55] the
[2:12:57] &gt;&gt; with our heads bowed.
[2:13:00] Father, God of Abraham, Isaac, and
[2:13:03] Jacob,
[2:13:05] God of Moses, Elijah, the prophets,
[2:13:10] God of the apostles, and of the
[2:13:11] messengers, God that stood in attendance
[2:13:15] continually
[2:13:16] with our prophet, messenger, our
[2:13:18] precious brother Brandham. And you are
[2:13:21] the God and father of our Lord Jesus
[2:13:23] Christ. You brought him forth.
[2:13:26] He was conceived in the womb
[2:13:29] of a woman, Mary, a virgin.
[2:13:34] And from there, he took a body
[2:13:37] of this earth, the same dust that we are
[2:13:39] in.
[2:13:42] And the word was in him, and he was the
[2:13:45] word.
[2:13:46] [Music]
[2:13:48] &gt;&gt; He lifted up and reclaimed this earth as
[2:13:51] his own possession.
[2:13:53] and was raised up high. We can say
[2:13:57] today, high and lifted up,
[2:13:59] &gt;&gt; higher than Goltha,
[2:14:02] &gt;&gt; higher than the heavens,
[2:14:04] higher than the angels to the right hand
[2:14:07] of the majesty on high. You are raised
[2:14:11] up. And we see we see the end sign. We
[2:14:15] see the banner, our standard. And oh
[2:14:19] God, not a prayer but my very soul
[2:14:23] rising up within me. Say we we we are we
[2:14:27] pledge our allegiance
[2:14:29] &gt;&gt; to this end sign, this lamb of God, this
[2:14:33] sacrifice that bore our stain. And now
[2:14:37] send forth your Holy Spirit.
[2:14:40] And I ask that it shall continue with
[2:14:43] the people. Surround them, permeate
[2:14:46] them,
[2:14:47] &gt;&gt; and do not allow these words to escape
[2:14:50] their minds.
[2:14:52] &gt;&gt; Seal it in the womb of their minds.
[2:14:55] &gt;&gt; Oh God, let every life be holy, fully
[2:14:59] surrendered, so much in oneness and
[2:15:01] unity until you just come, oh Lord, and
[2:15:06] you'll be so pleased to be in
[2:15:07] attendance. Come tonight, oh God, as our
[2:15:10] brother Lance comes and as he opens up
[2:15:13] the scriptures, I pray, Father, it'll be
[2:15:15] such an illumination. Come and
[2:15:17] fellowship with us.
[2:15:21] &gt;&gt; We want to walk in this Eden, not
[2:15:24] Satan's Eden, but this Eden that you
[2:15:27] have made for us.
[2:15:28] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:15:29] &gt;&gt; Have fellowship with you.
[2:15:32] Father, I commend this word
[2:15:35] and the burden of the word of the Lord
[2:15:39] which was in my heart today
[2:15:41] and delivered by the Holy Spirit to the
[2:15:43] people
[2:15:45] and now it's the Lord Jesus on their
[2:15:47] hands.
[2:15:49] May they
[2:15:51] ponder deeply
[2:15:53] these things. And I pray that in the
[2:15:56] coming days and even beginning today,
[2:16:00] there will be dramatic changes that will
[2:16:02] take place by the power of the Holy
[2:16:04] Ghost.
[2:16:06] Let all manner of glorious things take
[2:16:08] place. May the sick be healed.
[2:16:12] &gt;&gt; May the demonp possessed be free.
[2:16:15] &gt;&gt; May Satan be rebuked even now. The Lord
[2:16:18] rebuke you, Satan.
[2:16:20] You cannot hold God's property. Whether
[2:16:23] it be present in this building or
[2:16:25] elsewhere, you cannot hold it. For we,
[2:16:29] oh God, are your servants. We, oh God,
[2:16:33] are your ministers on earth. I pray that
[2:16:36] even now, Father, you'll bring the bring
[2:16:39] those that are in bondage and set them
[2:16:42] free that they may be here in the house
[2:16:44] of God, rejoicing in the liberty
[2:16:47] wherewith Christ has made us free.
[2:16:50] &gt;&gt; Let this word be anchored and lodged in
[2:16:52] our hearts.
[2:16:54] Lord, as we depart this place, I pray we
[2:16:58] will do so with all somnity.
[2:17:00] [Music]
[2:17:02] &gt;&gt; I commit this congregation to you.
[2:17:06] In the beloved name of our Lord Jesus
[2:17:08] Christ, our end sign, lifted up, our
[2:17:11] wave chief waving over us,
[2:17:14] &gt;&gt; we give ourselves to you.
[2:17:17] &gt;&gt; We bless your name.
[2:17:20] Bless your people
[2:17:23] in Jesus Christ's name. Amen.
[2:17:28] &gt;&gt; I'm going to dismiss you without any
[2:17:31] further words.
[2:17:34] you obey the Lord. Have the kind of
[2:17:38] afternoon that would be pleasing to him.
[2:17:41] Don't let these things slip out
[2:17:44] of your mind and out of your thoughts,
[2:17:46] but I would encourage you to ponder them
[2:17:49] and let them have an effect upon you.
[2:17:52] God bless you. You're dismissed in the
[2:17:55] name of Jesus Christ.
[2:18:00] [Music]
[2:18:21] I want to mention also that next Sunday
[2:18:24] evening is the Lord's table. We have
[2:18:26] communion foot washing next Sunday. God
[2:18:29] bless you.
