Video clip with End Time Message through God's vindicated prophet of Malachi 4:5-6, William Marrion Branham, from 1909 to 1965. It's Jesus Christ revealing Him just before the end time. See Luke 17:30 and Rev 10:7

AMOS 3:7
  7    Surely the Lord GOD will do nothing, but he revealeth his secret unto his servants the prophets.

REVELATION 10:7
  7    But in the days of the voice of the seventh angel, when he shall begin to sound, the mystery of God should be finished, as he hath declared to his servants the prophets.
TRANSCRIPT
========================================
and so now before we start I would just like to say that if anybody wanted to see this article on um a Church Rock as the drums roll the Presbyterian Minister here um uh leading his congregation in rock and roll a program for the for the sacrament let me just see just a minute youthful members swing out to jazz jazz Passion Play tells of the crucifixion in modern iom rock and roll the pastor here leading all the teenagers up there and going through the passions of Christ the crucifixion played out and rock and roll in jazz well it's in Maryland now isn't that something and then here is the picture of those uh I was telling you this morning of those Beatles The Return of Beatles And there's the articles you just should read it out of the magazine and all of the different thing as it were had founded a new religion now they're a manager I've got a note out of the paper here you haven't got time if anybody wants to read these I put them on the bulletin board and you can read them I just want to show you the hour that we're living in shocking you might not understand it but people try to understand it that what these things are I've asked brother capsy got a good education and can read better than I I've asked him to read this article from the manager of the Beatles you do it brother the Caps states that the Beatles wonder about themselves and draw no answers it's incredible absolutely incredible says Derek Taylor The Beatles press officer here are these four boys from Liverpool they're rude they're profane they're vulgar and they've taken over the world it's as if they'd founded a new religion they're completely Antichrist I mean I'm Antichrist as well but they're so Antichrist they shock me which isn't an easy thing but I'm obsessed with them isn't everybody I'm obsessed with their honesty and the people who La them most are the people who should be outraged most in Australia for example each time we'd arrive at an airport it was as if deal had landed or better yet the Messiah The Roots were lined solid cripples threw away their sticks sick people rushed up to the car as if a touch from one of the boys would make them well again old women stood watching with her grandchildren as we'd passed by I could see the look on their faces it was as if some savior had arrived and all these people were happy and relieved as if things somehow were going to be better now Taylor paused and stuck a cigarette in his mouth the only thing left for the Beatles he said is to go on a healing tour isn't that what he said many shall come to me in that day and say Lord have not I se now can't you see that you can't P your trust in heating campaigns you can't put your trust in any kind of a sign like that the only thing you can put your trust in is thus sayeth the Lord from the Bible I church that is a exactly where I have tried to keep you my children and if something happens to me and God takes me out of this Earth don't you never fail remember this with all your heart stay with that word don't you leave that word anything contrary to it leave it alone no matter what it is then you know it's right a healing campaign now sinful man that even shocked their own man with their Bulger and dirt and filth and people throw away their crutches and get healed by looking at these boys it's so filthy and dirty and Antichrist you see it's Satan on a mock campaign see he does anything that the Christ can do but he can't confirm the word he'll take part of it year and part of it year but he can't take it all together see he can't get it together so you see no wonder the Bible said that would almost fool the very elected if it was possible the Antichrist Spirit now even their own press manager here press agent he's for him believes in him and said he's possessed of the same thing because they've wanton him over them evil things and now don't you see women why I am trying to tell you about this short wearing hair cutting bobbing and things it's a spirit it is a spirit here it is right in our leading magazines and everything of what showing not rock and rolling stuff in the church why it's a setup exactly for Satan and there's still churches and denominations back to the word children is fast as you can go don't you dare to leave it you stay right with that word see how that Antichrist Spirit it can speak in tongues you can show signs and wonders you can heal the sick you can do all these things see them people thinking they're approaching God at the boys where God sent because the church has let down on the [Music] word those boys belong to church Elvis Presley is a Pentecostal Pat Boon is a Church of Christ look at them guys Pentecostals Church of Christ and all those like that with them evil spirits on them read fully a golden voice Church of Christ sing the religious songs like nobody can sing them and rock and roll in the next Voice by their fruits you know them look what churches they belong to Elvis Presley and members of the Assemblies of God there you are each one of them wanted that and Satan give it to them don't you see friends how don't let loose of that word see it's a spirit that gets on you now I tell these women when they make themselves look sexy in these dresses that God's going to make you answer for committing adultery if you believe me to be what you say God's servant a prophet listen to what I'm telling you see you might not be able to understand it if you can't then you just do what I tell you to do God will hold me responsible for what I say see you listen real close and remember that those things are Spirit ordinarily maybe the person don't you remember God with skin I preached so not long ago see see God it with skin on it now just remember some of us are sent to this world to break into these rims to tell us these things see it's the for knowledge it's God speaking showing when you judge anything by the flesh why they're innocent look here fine people honest wouldn't tell yall l or nothing and the whole thing is a devil religious even starting a healing campaign see of just exactly Antichrist as Presbyterian and all that you see them denominations how they do right the same thing well here in London England just recently they had a rock and roll team to impersonate Christ and Judas and all that and uh they called Christ Daddyo and talked all those c words them crazy kids talk see the teenage kids tuck over the world now you know that the Bible predicts that unthankful Unholy without natural affections truth Breakers false accusers disobedient to parents teenage taking over the world and it's done it I went into a place the other day there playing this one of these old dirty Juke boxes all that stuff I didn't even want to take my family I said to that lady how much is them records cost 10 cents a piece how many would have play an hour she told me I said here's the money unplug it well she said I couldn't do that them kids come in here to play that then I couldn't spend no money there I went somewhere else see well that stuff that make you nervous you'd have to go down and get a bunch of prizers to say actually hearing the crazy stuff that just irks a Christian if you like that kind of stuff you know what's wrong with you you need to get saved cuz what's in you is feeding on something besides the word it's feeding on you couldn't imagine Jesus doing a thing like that could you could you imagine one of the prophets doing such a thing don't you see fans the whole thing all over is the devil and the Bible said how he would come in form of religion and just do just exactly like the Christ see but the only way you'll ever be able to tell it is not join this church or join that church stay with the word he is the word but in the days of the voice of the seventh angel when he shall begin to sound the mystery of God should be finished as he hath declared to his servants the prophets
