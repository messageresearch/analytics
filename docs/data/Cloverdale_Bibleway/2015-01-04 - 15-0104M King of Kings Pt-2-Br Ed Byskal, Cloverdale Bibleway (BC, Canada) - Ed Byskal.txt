I believe he's just so pleased with your worship this morning. Blessed be your name, Lord. Amen. I'm going to ask our brother Tim God if he would come open the service for us in a word of prayer. Amen. We do have a testimony from the Snow family. They wanted to let be known before you. So we wanted to return thanks to the Lord for his mercies and all who prayed for Ryan. He had developed cysts on his back and in his chest. And the doctors had ordered tests to be performed. A couple of weeks ago, we came up for prayer and after all the tests, the report came back and all is normal and the cysts have already begun to disappear. All praise to him. Thank you, Lord. Hallelujah. Amen. And also my family. Just wanted to extend a warm heartfelt thanks to all the phone calls and emails and texts and cards and everything that we've just received over the past weeks. We're truly so appreciative for all the giving and all the prayers. You've been remembering us through this time. We just wanted you to know that even if we haven't been able to respond to each one that we deeply appreciate it and we love you and we're very thankful be a part of the family of God. Amen. Brother Tim, why don't you come? Amen. Isn't the Lord good to us? &gt;&gt; Amen. You're looking forward to 2015. &gt;&gt; Just think of the mighty things God has done this last year. How much greater is this coming year going to be? &gt;&gt; Amen. And I was spoken speaking with brother Sam Ray just before the service and and he and sister Rebecca uh would like to thank the Lord for answered prayer after watch night. Uh they brought uh young Jack up. He had been troubled four nights in a row not being able to sleep all night. And so you can well imagine what that does to a young child. And they brought him up to up for prayer. We prayed with them and they just want to know want everyone to know the Lord has touched him and he has slept wonderfully since that time. Our God is a mighty healer and a mighty deliverer. I wonder if you have a need this morning, why don't you just raise your hand to him? And I'm sure he sees everyone individually. Heavenly Father, &gt;&gt; Lord, we are so thankful to serve a living God, &gt;&gt; not a God of history. Not a God who said, "I am the I was," but he said, "I am the I am." &gt;&gt; Lord, the very present God. You're a very present help. You are our healer, our physician. Lord, you are our very help in a time of trouble. Lord, you're the one that delivers us from all our situations. You are our salvation. You're our joy. You're our hope. You are our peace, our rest, oh God. In you do we put our trust. And Lord, we just come confessing at the beginning of another year, even as we made the transition on watch night, we are in such expectation every service, oh God. Lord, we are looking forward to every meeting with you. We're looking forward to great things that you shall do. And Lord, we thank you this morning that we could gather together in your presence. Lord, you're here because you said in your word that wherever two or three are gathered in your name, you are here in the midst of them, you keep your word. And we believe that with all of our hearts. And you see these requests represented by the hands that are raised. Lord, may you come as you are a personal God to each and every individual circumstance. Lord, deliver and heal and touch and meet needs and give the desires of their heart, Lord. Oh, Father, we thank you the way that you deal with us and that you know our need better than we know it ourselves. You know the right answer, Lord. And so we pray not our will but your will be done. We ask Lord this morning as brother Bisll would come behind the sacred desk Lord may you anoint him Aresh. We're so looking forward to because we love your word. We love your servant. We appreciate your love gifts to the body, Lord. And we ask once again that you'll minister through your servant this morning. Bless the song service. And Lord, even as we offer up this offering this morning, as the ushers, the deacons are ready to take the offering, we do it as unto you, Lord. Not as unto a man or a church or or or just some kind of earthly kingdom, but Lord, you've blessed us. And we want, Lord, that you would accept our offerings as we lift it unto you as may it be pleasing in your sight. We commit ourselves, this service, all things into your hands in the wonderful name of Jesus Christ. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. [Music] Amen. God bless you. Have your seats. Amen. Maybe if brother Eba could come, he's going to sing a special for us. As he comes, why don't we sing the same God that spoke to the woman at the well. It's the same God that's living in me. This came in my mind as brother Tim was praying. Amen. Let's sing the first verse. Oh, I look back on history. I see a mighty God, proving over and over that his word has never failed. But I can't keep on dwelling on the past memory. [Music] Cuz he's the same God who's living in me. Oh, I ask the same God who spoke to the woman at the well. is the same God who wonders too many to tell. The same God raing. He's the same God. [Music] Somewhere just across the Jordan River. He's a place of everlasting joy and peace. We the tree of life is blooming there forever. And a crown of life is waiting there for me. That sounds like home to me. Cuz where I always want to be, there'll be no tears that will dim my eyes again. The hills will go with the story as we sing his love and glory. Where the saints of God will be that sounds like home to me. The sus manion dear inside that city. [Music] A crystal river flowing by the tree of life. No pain, no disappointment will have a hot horse. And Jesus Christ himself will be the light. That sounds like home to me. That's where I always want to be. There'll be no tears that will dim my eyes again. The hills were going the story as we see his grace and glory where the saints of God will be that sound like home to me. [Music] That sounds like home to me. That's where I always want to be. There'll be no fears that will deep our eyes again. Though he will know it, the story has seen his grace and glory where the saints of God will be. That sounds like home to me. [Music] [Applause] Good morning. God bless you. Well, it's wonderful to be in the house of God on a snowy, cold, wintry day. To be where the sun is shining, &gt;&gt; where the warmth of God's presence is amongst us. We're thankful that we have a place that we can run into and are safe. This morning, we have a baby dedication. Sister Melissa and Dave Monley have their daughter to be dedicated this morning. So, why don't we have Sister Melissa come with her family and sing my favorite song? Jesus loves me, this I know. Jesus loves this I know. For the Bible tells me so. Little ones. To him belong. They are weak. But he is strong. Yes. Jesus loves me. Yes. Jesus loves me. &gt;&gt; Yes. Jesus loves me. The body tells me so. &gt;&gt; Well, standing here this morning, Sister Melissa, who I have known since a little girl, and now she's grown up to be a mother, a lovely young lady, and cradling in her arms is a a little darling, and it's Deanna Grace Molley. And um I just want to read a scripture that is I believe fitting sister Melissa because we have to see ourselves in the Bible and the Bible is the most important thing to us. That's what we live for. And there was a woman in a scripture that uh Jesus talks about and Matthew writes about in Matthew 15 and 22 and said that there was a woman of Canaan that came out of the coast and cried unto him saying have mercy on me, oh Lord, thou son of David, my daughter is grievously vexed. And I thought the love of a mother. What will a love of a mother do? And I looked up of course to the message what the prophet said. The love of a mother who mother is the fifth gospel is one of the strongest force there are. And this woman was willing to to go against all that they said against Jesus. All the religious people were calling him nasty things. But she realized the answer for her daughter was Jesus. And even the disciples gave her a problem and said, "Lord, send her away. Send her away." And yet her faith looked to the lamb of God, knowing that he was the answer for her daughter. And she was persistent until finally she got to the master. And even the Lord then said, you know, is it meat that the that I give the children's bread to dogs? And she was a Canaanite. She was a Sarapheneician. She was somebody that was not even in the kingdom of God. And she said, "Yay, Lord." And the humility that she had, Sister Melissa, your humility, she said, "Even, yay, Lord, even the dogs will eat the crumb from the master's table." And that humility turned the heart of God. The love of a mother turned the heart of God that God delivered that little girl that moment. And I thought, well, here's this little jewel that God has given this Moly family. And how a mother now, she knows that the world doesn't have the answers. The world will tear her apart. She'll be grievously vexed. But she knows there's one thing that could help this little girl, and that's Jesus. Jesus Christ the living word. &gt;&gt; Amen. And this little jewel is called Deanna Grace Molley which means divine. Her middle name grace divine grace. And I believe sister Melissa that I don't know how you and Dave came to the conclusion to name your daughter that. But it doesn't matter where you go through the scriptures. Wherever God met somebody, they gave a special name to that place. And God met this our dear sister Melissa one day at church, God kindled, rekindled her heart. And there was a special name that came at that time, divine grace. And thus, we have this little darling this morning that we want to dedicate to the Lord. We don't baptize babies because the Bible says repent and be baptized. We dedicate our children to the Lord that God would receive them back from the very one who gave us this child. We ask God would you take care of this child and watch over divine grace Deanna Grace Moly. Amen. Let's pray. Precious Lord, in my arms this morning is a gift of God that you have given Sister Melissa and Dave Moly. Lord Deanna Grace, divine grace. Would your hand be upon her, Lord? Would you always put a wall of fire around her? Keep her from all harm and sickness. And Lord Jesus, as this little woman in the scriptures found that Jesus was the answer, Lord, sister Melissa has found that Jesus is the answer. &gt;&gt; And God sovereign grace stepped on the scene and you've given them thus this darling girl. I just pray that Lord that your hand of blessing be upon her. May the grace of God ever go before her. And Father, as the name indicates, one who is like God. May she reflect your glory and your grace at a young age. Bless this little darling, Lord, as we dedicate her to you this morning. And may your Holy Spirit shine upon her and may the love of God overshadow her in Jesus name. We give her to you for the glory of God. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Maybe I should have had girls. I only had boys. Amen. God bless you all this morning. Amen. We're going to invite our pastor to come. Why don't we sing Blessed Assurance, Jesus is mine. 681. [Music] Amen. Oh, blessed assur Jesus is mine. Oh, what a taste of glory divine. I'm an air of salvation, virt. [Music] Oh yes, this is my story. Yes, this is my soul. I'm praising my savior all the day long and this is my story. This is my song. I'm praising my savior all the day long too. Oh, perfect sufficient perfect as [Applause] [Music] my son. [Music] Angels descend from [Music] mercy. Whispers of love. Oh yes, this is my story and this is my song. I'm praising my savior all the day long. This is my story. This is my song. I'm praising myior all the last verse. Oh, and perfect salvation and all is as I say [Music] am happy and blessed. I'm watching and waiting [Music] filled with his goodness. Lost in this is my story. Yes, this is my song. I'm praising my savior all the day long. This is my story. This is my song. Praising myior. [Music] &gt;&gt; Amen. Well, God bless you all this morning. Are you having a happy eternity? &gt;&gt; That's good. Uh, I wanted to give you greetings. I must give you greetings which just arrived yesterday from brother Garrett Rodal in Germany and uh they have the church there just in Basillesburg. Been there a long time. have a wonderful church and he wanted to send his greetings to you. Also, there was greetings from uh brother Yenko uh in Serbia and he had a phrase in his his email that I just thought you all need to hear. He said, "Your fellowship is like a beehive full of honey from the field. If someone comes to steal it away, when they come back, there's only more. So, I thought to all of you bees that are bringing honey, that's what someone out there is receiving. &gt;&gt; It just seems like a beehive full of honey. I thought that was so sweet and so wonderful. We also want to be remembering uh uh brother Tom and brother Murphy going to be going to China uh first part of February and be having a number of meetings there but also one of the one of the main objectives which I I trust we'll be able to achieve and that is that we'll be meeting with different pastors and having pastors ministers meetings as well as other uh meetings. But we have the Bible Bibles for China. The Bible translation is complete ready. Uh now uh thanks to brother Darren and his uh work. I don't want to even call it work or endeavor. It's just a a mission to write a program so that it can be searched. The Bible can be searched in any language and but we're going to have the Bible printed, the new translation printed. So, it's two things. One is a Bible reader and the other is the Bible itself. And there's a lot of uh a lot of decisions that need to be made with regards to the Bible printing itself. Uh whether in a hard cover or some in a hard cover, some in a soft cover, a leather cover. Um, and the Bible will be for all all people, all Christians as a whole. And uh, it it it's a just a tremendous thing for me to stand here. I feel so humbled to think that God allows us and allows people that God has sent here. We didn't know brother Murphy, Sister Tracy. Uh we didn't know many of the people that are here now. Uh we didn't know that that would be an open door for China. Uh a nation that I don't think the prophet of God was able to actually visit and and yet it seems that there's something left for us to do. And I think it's wonderful. &gt;&gt; And then to see what is happening within uh uh Africa uh and the many many churches that are rising up even though we know and we believe that the scripture is true. When he returns shall he find faith on the earth? And the prophet of God comes and tells us. He said, "I can tell you one thing. It will be very, very few." So, I'm glad that we can be one of the few. &gt;&gt; Amen. We've heard the word. Also, we're going to be in prayer for and with our brother Timothy Ono. Uh he is leaving this next week to go back to Johannesburg for a season. And uh what we're praying for, you said, "Well, what should we pray for?" Pray that the season will be very short. And so will you pray for that? &gt;&gt; You join with me and pray that the season will be very very short. I know that his family will be praying for it. But that we are his family. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And we dearly love our brother Timothy and uh pray that he we will see him very soon. All right. Now, uh, one place, Brother Brennham said, "You know why I'm stalling?" And I guess I'm stalling, too. We bit. We just want to have the right moment and the right atmosphere for the service this morning. I have I want to carry on from last week uh speaking on the King of Kings. And I would like to say a couple things. You know, you you stand here and this is the format of a church and a preacher and a service and the ministry and so on so forth. But uh we are not here to gain some information. &gt;&gt; And we're not here just to gain some spiritual knowledge. &gt;&gt; But there comes a time when there must be implementation. &gt;&gt; One is where we gain or we may rejoice or we may be happy. We may have a service like the watch night service, but one of the hardest things is implementation. I'm sure that there's a number of people here where you've read all kinds of things about diets. Implementation is difficult. My wife reminds me uh that the treadmill upstairs is rusting out and uh there's uh there's nothing wrong with the equipment and there's nothing wrong really with me but it's just for me to get upstairs and the implementation part is very difficult. Now, some of you folks look so sanctimonious like you never you've never run into that. No, I know better. Implementation is is tough. So, now I'm preaching this morning for the purpose of implementation. And so, we know that that is u more more challenging, shall we put it that way. I wonder if you would uh stand with me and I I would like to sing one uh just a course of uh verse maybe in a course of redeemed. Redeemed how I love to proclaim it. Uh I'm sorry I didn't get the number. [Music] Redeemed how I love to proclaim it. And I'd like you to make the declaration when we come to that course. Redeemed redeemed. redeemed by the blood of the lamb. Amen. [Music] Love to proclaim redeemed [Applause] [Music] through his mercy. His power forever. I am redeeing [Music] my blood of the lamb. Redee [Music] is forever. I am the first I know I shall see his beauty but he is my delight. You died in my footsteps and given me songs in the night. [Music] his child forever. [Music] &gt;&gt; And everyone could say, "Praise the Lord." &gt;&gt; Amen. We're going to be reading in Ephesians the 6th chapter and we'll read from verses 11-1 17. Before we read, I would like to say because uh we will be uh merging with the service from last week and we spoke of Joshua and the he he numbers the kings, names the kings and cities, many of them uh and I will be referring to that. But I want to make the statement and have it very emphatically understood that what was physical in the Old Testament is now spiritual. And and as we speak of uh Joshua, Joshua simply means Jehovah Savior. And so when Joshua was preparing, now here's the setting. I went home a couple weeks ago and I was thinking or a week ago, I was thinking, how did he prepare for these incredible battles that he had? And he he was absolutely ruthless and how does that how does that apply to us and how do we implement it? And uh then I immediately thought of Jesus because Jesus Joshua savior Jesus was the savior and Joshua prepared and he prepared the pe people and went to into incredible battles. Now that's either just a story with no meaning to us or it has a direct meaning to us and we we we may if we don't grasp it, if we don't catch it, we won't have this victory that he enjoyed. And if he is giving the people their inheritance, we're the people and we're the people with the inheritance. And so how does that apply to us? So I got thinking how did Jesus coming to the battle of the ages, the struggle of the ages, the battle of the ages when he was coming to Calvary. And I was pondering just to myself for several days, how did he prepare himself to come to this incredible battle where he would actually crush the head of the serpent and fulfill the prophecy, the first prophecy that was ever given, which was given by God himself, that the seed of the woman would bruise the serpent's head. And here he's coming to that battle of the ages and the victory of the ages &gt;&gt; and how is he preparing to do that and uh I will come to that and that will have to be our example but Jesus was preparing now and he he wouldn't be uh he wouldn't be protect uh guarding himself with the sword and shield and those things, but yet it had a spiritual application. I'm going to try to make it very very clear and expect that the congregation will be able to take something home that will make life different. That's what I actually pray for. And implementation is very very awkward and very hard. But we need to implement some things. &gt;&gt; I believe that be pray. You know, we're talking about the rapture and the coming of Christ and the fulfillment of the scripture. And I believe that uh it takes some doing and and not that it's works, but it just takes a different a different way of believing. And I'm going to conclude with one thing and that is the prophet said it's the simplicity. It's the simplicity. Does everybody hear me? It's the simplicity that we stumble over. So I pray that God will give us uh a special divine quickening so we'll understand what is the simplicity. We don't want to stumble over something that's so simple. &gt;&gt; And so God help us. Now we're going to read. I'm going to read you one verse before we read Ephesians. And you don't have to turn to it. It's just a oneline verse out of First Corinthians 14. and 8. For if the trumpet give an uncertain sound, who shall prepare himself to the battle? If we are going to call in and conquer, who's going to prepare themselves to battle? Now, we'll read in Ephesians 6 and 11. Put on the whole armor of God that you may be able to stand against the ws of the devil. For we wrestle not against flesh and blood, but against principalities, against powers, against the rulers of the darkness. May I say that again? Against the rulers of the darkness of this world, against spiritual wickedness in high places. Wherefore take unto you the whole armor of God, that you may be able to withstand in the evil day, and having done all to stand. Stand therefore, having your loins girded about with truth, and having on the breastplate of righteousness, and your feet shaw with the preparation of the gospel of peace, above all, taking the shield of faith, wherewith you shall be able to quench all the fiery darts of the devil. I would like you know rose above all take the shield of faith &gt;&gt; and take the helmet of salvation and the sword of the spirit which is the word of God. Heavenly father, we stand here in your presence. We stand as your children. We stand as those that have been purchased by the blood of Jesus Christ. We stand, oh God, that we might take our position. We stand, oh God, that we might put on the whole armor of God and and and not just to meet the uh opposing forces, but to have victory over them. &gt;&gt; Lord, we're not wallowing in defeat, &gt;&gt; but we are rising in victory, and we are praising your name for what you have achieved for us. In the name of Jesus Christ, we pray. Amen. You may be seated. To wrestle, we wrestle not against flesh and blood, but to wrestle is a contest between two individuals and in which one endeavors to throw the other and which is decided when the victor is able to hold his opponent down. Not just throw him down, but hold him down. Put his hand upon his neck. A ruler. We need these just for we can move forward. A ruler is uh it's only used once in the New Testament. The Greek terminology for the ruler only used once, but it's a ruler, lord of the world, prince of this age. The devil and demons are called this and that is directly out of the uh Greek not Greek Bible but the Greek meaning for the word. I just want you to have that and hold that. And then it it also is tied into the world ruler of the world and the world which is the cosmos. It's not the world that the ground that we're standing on, but the world it is the the arrangement or the constitution. Uh you have a constitution in the United States. Uh we have a constitution in Canada. Many countries have constitutions. It's the order or the arrangement by which the country operates. And that's the cosmos. That's the world. And every country has perhaps a different set of regulations, rules, taxation, education, all of these various things. And they all look upon it differently. But it the the world is also world affairs. The aggregate, the complete aggregate of things earthly, the whole circle of earthly goods, endowments, riches, advantages, opportunities, pleasures, etc. which allow which although hollow hollow vain and fleeting because they pass and change so quickly. They stir the desire and seduce from God and are obstacles to the cause of Christ. &gt;&gt; Was that well said? the ungodly multitude of people alienated from God and therefore hostile to the cause of Christ. That is the world. &gt;&gt; The multitudes and masses which are alienated from God and opposed to God, &gt;&gt; that's the world. And that's not to affect the believer. &gt;&gt; But we are in the world. Jesus said we are in the world, but we are not of the world. The world has not produced us. &gt;&gt; The world has not produced this message. &gt;&gt; The world has not produced our faith. &gt;&gt; The world has not produced what the believer is. I'm talking about the dedicated surrendered believer. &gt;&gt; And we're going to make some distinction on these things. So now that's the world. So the the the scripture that Paul is saying, we wrestle not against flesh and blood. But we do wrestle against principalities &gt;&gt; and against powers. We do against rulers of the darkness of this world. When you read that, you cannot feel like you're being a pathy. &gt;&gt; You know what I mean? &gt;&gt; You cannot feel as though someone who's just got their arms hanging down. In fact is I cannot read this and just view someone we come to church on Sunday. &gt;&gt; That's not what this is talking about. This is talking about people that have force and they realize that they're fighting a struggle every day and they realize they've been called to victory. &gt;&gt; And everyone, you know, we we perhaps face times in our lives where it seems that we come against a stone wall. But that stone wall is not to prevent you in your spiritual life. &gt;&gt; You may have it. You may hit it. You may come against it. But you will have you are you are elected. You are called to have victory over that. &gt;&gt; And then you think, well, victory over what? I want to be very specific today. Whatever your inheritance, whatever Christ bought for you, that is your inheritance in Christ. And if you have something that is just ramming at you and hindering you and and preventing you from coming into what you know in your heart is yours, rightfully yours, then you want to be very aggressive and very persistent and exercise your faith towards that. I know that God is not intending that I go through life lacking this and being without this. He bought it for me. Jesus went to Calvary for me. And I know that this is mine. &gt;&gt; This is part of my inheritance. You have to decide what your inheritance is. And then also this world this this word ruler which it involves world it also involves comes from a word strength and strong and to have power to be powerful to be chief this is what is in Satan's mind to be powerful to be to have power to be powerful to be chief to master to be the master and to rule. That says the part of of against the rulers of darkness. This is what in the mind to get possession of, to become master of, to take hold of, you know, it was spoken of here just a few days ago. It says, well, maybe one of our young people that they would uh that they would excel in in in sports. I hope not. I hope not. You say, "Well, why? That's what we everybody we want them to excel." Well, then they will be they'll be called and and and and put into teams and they want them to play on Sunday. That's why a believer needs to go to the heart of the subject right away. &gt;&gt; We're going to talk about king economy. We're &gt;&gt; going to talk about king immigration. &gt;&gt; We're going to talk about king education. &gt;&gt; They're all good, but they're not to become king. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Our jobs. They want to rule and Satan would like to rule. And and when you have a prophet that just gives a oneliner, &gt;&gt; every kingdom is of Satan. &gt;&gt; You'll need to agree with that because that's exactly the case. &gt;&gt; Every kingdom, king taxation, &gt;&gt; king economy. You're not in charge of the economy. The gas goes up, the gas goes down, the rent is this, the rent is that. You This is what you pay. Things have gone up in price and so on and so forth. You're not You're not in control of things, King. Inflation. You're not in control of inflation. &gt;&gt; My You're nice and quiet because this is the world we live in. &gt;&gt; You know, you can go here to a a collectible store and and see some old magazine and I guarantee you, you'll smile. Take an old 1930s magazine and you'll see a Ford and Ford car or you know Chev car or whatever beautiful page or advertising. Hey, they were getting the attention of the people back there. &gt;&gt; But the whole car is $928. Of course you smile and say, "And that car is $32,000 today." You say, "Well, things have really gone up." That's the world you live in. And you didn't say, you didn't decide it was worth 32,000. The world, the world, &gt;&gt; strong world, &gt;&gt; tells you what it's worth, what you're going to pay, what you're going to earn, I better get off that, but I'm trying to be a trumpet. If the trumpet gives an uncertain sound and then the in the message a trumpet gives an uncertain sound. Brother Brandham says, "Oh, the things that's got our democracy so corrupted until it's real shaky." We used to could put a lot of confidence in our democracy and which I do think it's the best form of government but still our uh our democracy is shaky because we see this nation our people we have a constitution and this constitution is our ultimate but yet that our constitution is shaky &gt;&gt; because it's it's already been broken. broen many times. &gt;&gt; It's shaky because it's been broken many times. And he carth for you. You like that title? He carth for you. You need that. When when I as I read it, you just keep thinking he carth for you. Satan is the ruler of every nation. He carth for you. &gt;&gt; Every kingdom belongs to Satan. He carth for you. You excuse me. I'm just having some I'm enjoying it. He rules them according to his own way of ruling. But did not he offer them to the son of God one day? These are mine. I do what I what I do with them whatever I want to do. All the kingdoms of the world. He offered them to Jesus Christ. He said that's the reason they fight and kill and murder. But Jesus said, "Get thee behind me, Satan. Isn't that wonderful the way he puts it together? Get thee behind me, Satan. For he knew that he would fall heir to them. &gt;&gt; And that's the position of every believer. Yes, it might be the way they want to run Christmas. Isn't it an amazing thing? You talk about You talk about king economy. Talk about who who's who would stand and say there's no commercialization over Christmas? At Christmas, it's even a pagan holiday. &gt;&gt; It's not even the It's not even the birth of Christ. But Satan somehow got control of it and brought it over to uh Christmas period. And a prophet has to come and say he's a lamb and he's born in the spring. &gt;&gt; He's not born in the winter. &gt;&gt; He's born in the springtime. And then here we come and now the whole thing is a complete chaotic time of party and depression and drunkenness and sin and revalry and all of these things. And this is Christ's birth that is a demon of hell &gt;&gt; that has taken and turned that into this kind of a and it's a total commercialization. And then after Christmas you're dealing with king economy, &gt;&gt; right? And I said, "Prince credit card." All right. In the uncertain sound again, he said, "If the trumpet gives an uncertain sound, who can prepare himself for battle?" So, I'm trying to give a clear sound this morning so we can prepare ourselves for battle. It's going to surprise you a few more a little ways down the road here. He said, "If it's if it's uncertain, what would a soldier do if it was preparing for battle? And if they give the sound and didn't sound like the regular sound to go to battle, he wouldn't know whether to retreat or whether to go to battle or whether to sat down or whether to eat his dinner or what to do or go to bed if it didn't give a certain distinct distinction in the sound. So God's word &gt;&gt; doesn't does not make any scruples. It gives a certain sound. Certain sound. When God speaks to an individual, &gt;&gt; and I pray he'll speak to individuals this morning. When he speaks to an individual, it's certain. &gt;&gt; I don't care what anybody else says, what science says, or what the nation says, what the world says, what the church says. And we can talk about king religion. Well, my religion who well my king &gt;&gt; listen I'm interested in one the king of kings &gt;&gt; and his and how he dispatches his word and how he handles his word. I'm interested in that. And if the king of kings decided I'm going to have a prophet and I'm going to stand beside him. I'm going to prove that I'm on the platform with him. I'm in the auditorium with him. That's the voice I want to hear. &gt;&gt; Say, well, the voice of my government or the voice of my church or the voice of my priest or the voice of my religion is different from that. Then you got to decide which one you're going to hang to and hold to. &gt;&gt; Whether it's the nation or whether it's the world or what the church says or what anybody else says, my friends or my associates. If they don't say what the word of God says, it's the end of it. &gt;&gt; And you can't pancy around with it. You can't soft glove the thing because if they're a real friend, if they're a real associate, they'll be affected by a real decision. People want reality. They want something that means something to a person. I heard last night from brother Murphy who's testifying now or he's speaking this in interpretation but we were talking about what God had done and it's it was such a joy brother Jason and to hear the testimony of your parents and the change in a man's life, in a young man's life. And brother Murphy was saying to me, it was about a year and a half after brother Jason was here. Now, this is the first time, Brother Jason, you've ever heard this. I sat on this platform and would see you at sitting in different places in the church. I actually saw that change coming on you. I saw God dealing with you. I saw you receiving the word of God. And I know that this word of God has transforming power. &gt;&gt; This is not a paperback book. It's not an ordinary book. It is it can take a hold of a man and it can take a hold of a girl and just change her. &gt;&gt; And they saw the change in you, Mary. Not that they didn't see changes other people, but we've seen the transforming power. I have sat here on the platform and saw the transforming power. I saw the transforming power in John Waldner. I've saw the transforming power in Jonathan Dertie and many many of you others and families here who've seen the transforming power. not leaving anyone out. But it's wonderful when you can see a young man or a young woman today and God gets a hold of their lives and and lays a hold of them. God knows what he wants to do with them. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And you simply want to say now we're in implementation. You want to say I will yield to you. &gt;&gt; Whatever you say, oh God, that's what I'm here to do. I'm not here to attend church. I'm here to come under the influence of the Holy Spirit and be transformed &gt;&gt; from an old man to a new man, &gt;&gt; from a from one kind of a son to another kind of a son. &gt;&gt; I say to Jason's mother and dad. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Apostle Paul said, "I'm not what I used to be. &gt;&gt; The things I once loved, I now hate. &gt;&gt; The things I once hated, I now love. That's the kind of change &gt;&gt; that's repentance. &gt;&gt; That's turning around and going the other direction. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So, I would like to I'm not going to get done today either. I won't try. But I would like to speak just give these two phrases to you. Life in the land or life in your inheritance. and the fruits in the land. &gt;&gt; The fruits. And that's going to be a shock to you. The fruits of your inheritance, &gt;&gt; they're yours. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Not what the world, we don't want the peace that the world tries to give. They can't find peace. &gt;&gt; We want the source and the author and the prince of peace. &gt;&gt; So the life in the land, what is the promised land? I'm sorry I don't have this for you on a PowerPoint. What is the promised land? The Holy Ghost. He said what laid what laid between Joshua and the promised land was the Jordan. We heard sung about it this morning. And possessing all things the land belongs in other words the Holy Ghost or your life. Your life in the Holy Ghost. I'm speaking to every person here on an individual personal level. Your life in the Holy Ghost is your inheritance. It's already been purchased. It's already been paid for. And there shall be nothing, nothing must be permitted or allowed to hinder you from that. And if something is hindering you from that, then you must become aggressive. &gt;&gt; You must say, "If this takes prayer, I'll pray. If this takes forgiveness, I'll ask forgiveness. Whatever this takes, whatever is holding me back, I'm going to see that this is removed out of my way and I'm going to enter into my inheritance. &gt;&gt; Lord, &gt;&gt; I'll just put this in here. Sometimes I I I I can show you in the scripture where some of these kings that come against you. It it says in the in the that this king heard a certain thing was happening, a certain victory was taking place. And it's not just history now, but this was in the natural. And when they heard about it, then they would call other kings and consult together and say, "Help me &gt;&gt; to come against this." &gt;&gt; And now you've you that are followers of the message, you've heard it. &gt;&gt; And a prophet of God will be standing right here behind the pullpit and he will and I'm going to go through and dissect one incident, one event where he said it very very clearly. And he said to the woman, "I am stalling and you don't know why I'm stalling. I don't want to get ahead of myself." But when he begins to deal with it, he said, "Now that now that demon is calling for another one to help him." &gt;&gt; And he identify where the other one is. &gt;&gt; And sometimes it might be a a sickness or a disease. Now friends, you're sitting here, but there's a whole host &gt;&gt; of spirits that's in opposition to you. &gt;&gt; It will I I if you're given over to criticism, you'll find something to criticize. &gt;&gt; If you're given over to doubt, you'll find something to doubt. &gt;&gt; If you're given over to whatever it is might be. But if you're given over to faith, &gt;&gt; you'll be given faith. If you're given over to the Holy Spirit of God, I want him dwelling in me. I want the fullness of the Holy Spirit. There's only one thing that you need to do, and that is you must be determined to yield to that Holy Spirit, whatever he says to do. &gt;&gt; And there were people in the scripture that that needed to have victory. There were there were believers, people who were going to have the inheritance, but they realized themselves that they weren't they weren't sufficient within themselves. And there's nothing wrong with a believer calling another believer and saying, "Help me here. Help me here. I need strength. I need a strong believer. I don't want somebody who's waffling around back and forth. I want somebody that knows where they stand. I want somebody who knows their God. I want somebody who knows how to pray, who knows how to believe. I want that person, come and pray with me, stand with me because I'm determined to have victory in this case. &gt;&gt; And God will honor that. &gt;&gt; We've had the experience at our own home. My wife has suffered sometimes and one one time it was so distinct and I I was I'm happy that it happened. So I have it as a testimony. We were just on our way to Tacoma to visit and she had her hand on the doororknob just going out the back door of our house and she said and she took her hand off as her coat. We both have our coats on. She turns around. She said, "Now notice this. I want you," is a wife speaking to a husband, "I want you to get the bottle of oil and anoint me with oil and pray for me. That thing has come back on me." And I said, "That thing had been from years ago." And the specialist said, "If that ever comes back, you get in contact with me right away." So that's how serious it was. Said, "I want you to get the bottle of oil and pray for me and anoint me with oil." And I and she said, "That thing has come back." I said, "When did it come back?" She said, "About 3 weeks ago." I said, "Why didn't you tell me earlier?" I went back into the kitchen. Listen to this. And I slid out a chair. I took the oil, which we had a little bottle of oil to anoint. if anybody needed prayer off the window sill. I anointed my wife with oil, prayed for her as we both knelt at a chair and got up and walked to the door. And by the time she put her hand on the door knob, she was healed. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; You know what it is? &gt;&gt; It's reading the textbook. &gt;&gt; Follow this textbook. &gt;&gt; And now she wasn't just speaking to her husband. And she was speaking to the office. &gt;&gt; The office. You're the pastor. You're the office. You're the one ordained. Take this bottle of oil and pray for me. And by the time God has to honor that. By the time we got to the door, it was gone. &gt;&gt; And it's never come back since. &gt;&gt; Let the congregation sing and say, "Amen." &gt;&gt; That's your God. And we're talking about a God that we can implement &gt;&gt; his instructions. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So the the fruit the life in the land and the fruits of the land. Okay. What is the fruits? We say well the fruits of the spirit and this is where I went right away. The fruits of the spirit is love, joy, peace, longsuffering, goodness, gentleness, faith, meekness, temperance. Against such there is no law. And that's all wonderful, but that goes right over our head because what does all of those things mean? But here's what the prophet says about the fruits. said the fruits and look what this Jesus of Nazareth done the other day. In other words, let me let me premise it by this. The fruits is the manifestation or the manifesting of a life. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The fruits of your life. But the fruits of the spirit is manifesting the promised word for this hour, for this day. And so now I'll I'll just finish reading this quote, please. And look what Jesus of Nazareth done the other day. What he ever do for the fruit of the spirit? He was coming into the temple. The money changers were there. You remember this story? and the sellers of oxen and sheep and doves and he was talking to businessmen. It was a message was paradox and he says he come and he kicked them things out and he emptied them up and told them there that they were a den of thieves. Not much fruit of the spirit there is there. He said your kind old priest never gets out of humor. This fellow, speaking of Jesus, planted ropes together and kicked the tables over and run them out of there and look angered at them. He said, "What is the fruit of the spirit?" Here's your question and here's your answer. The manifestation of the promised word. &gt;&gt; That's the fruit of the spirit. The spirit of God that authored this word, &gt;&gt; he didn't only he didn't only write it so that it would be spoken by uh men of God or churches or ministers or God's prophet to this day. That's not the full reason. The full reason is that it would then be believed &gt;&gt; come down into your heart &gt;&gt; and the spirit of God would come upon you. That's why it says you'll be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ. You repent and be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ and you shall you shall receive the gift of the Holy Spirit. And and and people ask what is that? It's the life of Christ. It's not your life that you came from your mother and dad. It's the life of Christ. It's another life from another land, from another world living in you in this world. That's right. &gt;&gt; Sons and daughters of God. &gt;&gt; Follow me thus far. &gt;&gt; I'm making this very very elementary. And he said the fruit of the spirit is a manifestation of the promised word. If he said if they had just stopped to look, he did not have these things that they had fruit of the spirit or anything. But the word that was promised for that day was manifesting himself and that was exactly the light of the hour and that was it. &gt;&gt; That's the fruit of the spirit. And no matter how much education or how kind &gt;&gt; or how much you might speak with tongues &gt;&gt; or how kind and gentle and everything you are, I've seen people that are uh almost I would admire they were just so kind and so gentle and so on and so forth. And that is good. There's nothing wrong about that. But but when it comes time to stand firm &gt;&gt; on this word, &gt;&gt; to stand absolutely on this word, &gt;&gt; whatever comes, &gt;&gt; whatever comes, &gt;&gt; say, "Well, this is going to cause a disaster. This is going to cause a rift in my family. This is going to cause whatever it costs. &gt;&gt; I'd hang my soul on the word of God. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; I'm looking at man down here, brother Milco Rabbar. You know him, but you maybe don't know the Milco that I know. He was a purser in an airlines. He was a head man, head honcho in the aircraft. He got saved. He came to this message. Been the airlines for years. You get to the top, you're the purser on a big jet. And I'm with him. I'm his pastor. So I hear about the things. I hear about his struggles because he goes on there. He goes on the plane and sees the women the way they're dressed. Well, now he's got different eyes. &gt;&gt; He says, "This looks terrible." And he tells them, "You look terrible. What are you saying?" So they go to the union and he gets in trouble and he comes to me says I'm in trouble with the union. They want to fire me but the union won't let them. The company wants to fire me cuz the people are and then uh you know they serve drinks. He says I don't I don't serve it anymore. So he just tell the other girls you do it. You do it. So suddenly he's he's he's not doing his job. You do it. Others do it. I can't do that anymore. And finally they told him uh at one point believe I have this pretty right I heard it enough times and they said to Milo you've got to stop that you stop talking about these things. He said I can't find the stop button. Where's the stop button? So he comes to me. He said I I can't find the stop button. So it became a mutual separation. He's one of two people. There was two. There's another person. I don't know who the other person is, but he was one of two people ever to get uh free flights from then on the rest of his life. And you say, "Wow, wow, wow, I could travel." No, no, no. That's why he gets on a plane and sometimes he'll fly to Ottawa just to get visas for us because he can fly there and back for next to nothing. And then that's why he goes with myself to be a help or goes to someone else to help them or takes uh takes message books or goes to encourage somebody over in Macedonia or over in uh Russia or wherever more cuz and when he comes with me generally his world flight cost about $150 and that's why they gave it to him. That's why he had to get fired. &gt;&gt; That had to happen. You say, "Well, you don't go down and say, "Well, you know what? I got fired." Praise God, I got fired. &gt;&gt; I wouldn't holler booze around. &gt;&gt; And I wouldn't lie about how people looked. &gt;&gt; Don't be quiet, folks. &gt;&gt; Be aggressive. &gt;&gt; I'm trying to put some something into your bodies. Spiritual bodies. &gt;&gt; Say, "Who had the fruits of the spirit?" He said, "Jesus." He said, "Search the scriptures. &gt;&gt; You think uh them you think you have eternal life. They testify of me. They tell of who I am." Never did come out and say who he was. He didn't tell them and why he got his congregation uh that great. He said, "Unless you eat the flesh of the son of man and drink his blood, as I said last night, you have no you have no life." And serves uh we would see Jesus, he said, "You want to see what the fruit of the spirit is? Watch what the Bible promises &gt;&gt; for a certain hour, &gt;&gt; then watch for that to be vindicated." &gt;&gt; You want to know what the spirit is? the fruits of the land, the fruits of the land. As you watch to see what God vindicates, &gt;&gt; you watch the word of God to see, look in here to see what is the promise of your day, of this hour. Then you watch for God &gt;&gt; to vindicate it and prove it. &gt;&gt; That's the fruit of the spirit, the fruit of the land. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; All right. Now, I said earlier Joshua divided up the land and his giving his last charge. If you want to read it when you get home, you can go to Joshua, the book of the book of Joshua, chapter 23 and 24. Don't go there now. But he he uh he had led them into the promised land, had already divided the inheritance to the tribes of Israel, and now was gathered all Israel to give them his last charge. And last week I gave you the chapter 12 where he gave the names of 31 kings. And these kings I just just to give a quick summary. These kings were there in God's plan and program. They were there. They were men of renown. They were men that were smart. They were men who could persuade people. They were kings. They were looked upon and re and respected as as a king. things that may oppose you in this world from being the kind of believer that you want to be. &gt;&gt; He's not your friend. &gt;&gt; He's your enemy. &gt;&gt; Anything that would try to persuade you away or to have a soft touch or to question or to what whatever position anyone might take. And sometime it can be a job. Sometime it can be a promotion. Sometime it could be a rose. Sometime it could be something that's natural in that some some men are built with physiques and bodies that I admire, but that might be your biggest trap. Some girls may be born with a certain attributes of beauty. That could be your biggest danger. You understand? &gt;&gt; That's the thing. Satan will throw roses down. Uh I I was at um I was at a a ceremony, graduation ceremony some years ago at one of our schools and they had a a lady there speaking. I think she was a professor. And she told the people that were graduating and all the people were that were there and there was hundreds of us there. And she said, "Now you people, you students will probably have five different occupations because and the bluecollar worker is uh going out completely. Bluecollar workers, those that for trades and all of those things and I just said to my wife, she's crazy. respectfully. She didn't know what she's talking about. You say, "Well, how do you say that? Why would you be disrespectful?" I said, I just said to my wife quietly, I said, "Where's the plumbers? Where's the electricians? Where's the guys who's going to fix the car? Where are these bluecollar workers?" Said, "You're never going to be done with them." But anyway, these young people were being fed and and they came past and uh you have to forgive me. I'm just I'm just Brother Biscll now. And they and the girls come by in all their robes and their hats and so on so forth. And uh this I I'm going to study psychology and then I'm going to take a year and travel to Europe and da da da. And I said she's going to be married and have a couple kids before she knows it. you know, and I I don't know how many I counted. We're going to study psychology. &gt;&gt; How is it &gt;&gt; terrible? &gt;&gt; It's terrible. &gt;&gt; Psychology where they question everything. &gt;&gt; Well, I was using psychology sitting in the listening to them. I say I I question that that she's going to travel for Europe for a year and then go do this and study and you know going to go take further education and I'm going to go to college. You know who was speaking? King education. &gt;&gt; Was it wrong to go to college? Not a bit. Not a bit. I wish I could have gone. I maybe learned something or whatever more. But I've had people come up and you know it didn't matter. I preached for 30 years. They'd say, "Where do you go to school?" It's called the school of hard knocks. &gt;&gt; It's called the school of of learning through making errors &gt;&gt; and and being able to recognize and say, "That was a wrong decision." I've had people come to me out of this congregation and said, "I've been offered a this wonderful wonderful uh promotion, and there's a huge increase in salary, but I have to I have to be out of out of touch with the believers. I have to be someplace else." There was a brother. He was sitting here in a watch night service and I looked up at him. His wife is here today. He came to me and he said, "Brother Red, I've been offered a job this years ago. I've been offered a job out way up in the north in the Yukon." He said, "And are going to fly me home about every 10 days or something." And but he said, "And they're going to pay me $80,000 a year net net just to be up there." He says, "I just said to them, and leave my church." Does that sound strange? No, he turned it down flat. &gt;&gt; He just turned down flat &gt;&gt; and that was that was his position. Uh, I'm I'm going to jump here as I want to. Shall I go on? &gt;&gt; Okay. No, it's on your It's your fault what I say. The first king, the first king that Joshua mentions is not even a king he had to deal with, but he mentions he goes right back to Abraham and moves forward. Then the first king, this may not mean much to you, but it means a whole lot to me. The first king was king of Moab, and he speaks of Bailac and Balam. And he says, uh, but God said about Moab, I've given Moab this country and don't want you fussing with them, Brother Brham says, or procelitating. Just move through gently. You know where you're going. &gt;&gt; Don't take their habits. And when Jesus, he he talks about Moab. Moab, for those of you that may not be as familiar with your Bible, Moab was the son of Lot by his daughter, by his eldest daughter. and the nation that descended from the son of Lot, the land inhabited by the descendants of the son of Lot, that was Moab. And uh Moab made some terrible choices. But now I want to come I I I was thinking and I would like you to come with me. And I know exactly. I want to I want to take this very very carefully and slowly because now I want to if it were the my last opportunity on life I would like to pass this principle off to you and this is the simple one that we stumble over. I thought what did Jesus do? How did he prepare for this great battle? I don't see him gathering strong men around him. I don't see him gathering influence. How is he preparing himself? If the trumpet gives a sound, how will we know if it gives an uncertain sound? How will we know to prepare ourselves for battle? And I I I just got thinking, friends, here we're sitting here. I'd like to sit across the table from you and say the reason why you're here is because we really are anticipating a rapture. &gt;&gt; I'm not coming to church in vain. I'm really here because I intend to make the rapture. &gt;&gt; I intend to go to another land. I intend to fulfill the scripture that says by Apostle Paul, we shall not all sleep, but we shall all be changed. And I think that everybody here wants to say yes. Amen. &gt;&gt; That's me. &gt;&gt; That's why I'm here. You've hit it, Brother Biscll. You've hit it the nail on the head. I'm here because I want to be changed. Amen. &gt;&gt; And the prophet says, "If we don't have faith for healing, how we have faith for a rapture?" &gt;&gt; So now that's what we're talking about. &gt;&gt; Oh, hear me friends. &gt;&gt; Hear me now as I approach this. How did Jesus prepare him? And I was asking myself this and one thought came to me and I know it was the Holy Spirit. Said, "Thou will not leave my soul in hell &gt;&gt; or suffer thy holy one to say corruption." And I thought, I want to see what the prophet of God said about that. He said, "And faith cometh by hearing." Now, I'm laying the principle. Watch this principle very closely. First we'll take it in Christ. Then we'll take it in the prophets of life and we'll take it to us now today here this morning. And he said in prayer when you came when you come to the earth you believe the word of God. You knew that God would keep his word. &gt;&gt; And that's the reason you said destroy this temple. Yes, &gt;&gt; he was facing his enemies. Destroy this temple. I will raise it up in three days. For David had said, "I will not leave his soul in hell. Neither will I suffer my holy one to see corruption." He said, "You believed," brother Brandham, speaking now to the Lord in prayer. You believed the word of God on that one promise. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. I got to nail this down. You believed the prophet of God praying now. You believed the word of God on that one promise. had on his way &gt;&gt; to the battle of the ages. &gt;&gt; I believe he will not leave my soul in hell nor suffer. &gt;&gt; He recognized who he was, thy holy one &gt;&gt; to see corruption. &gt;&gt; He believed that and he was prepared to go to the agonizing death of crucifixion. He was prepared to go through the mockery. He was prepared to go to the tomb and have the sele. &gt;&gt; Now friends, this isn't little poetic stories. &gt;&gt; This isn't just history. This is a principle that Jesus, your Lord, who's in you now, &gt;&gt; he went to the tomb be and allowed it to be sealed because he believed that one promise. &gt;&gt; And I thank the heavenly father for setting the example. &gt;&gt; This is the example, friends. This example. Let me get this. I pray that God help me get this across to you. And I thank the for heavenly father for setting that example. And now we accept it tonight and believe it. and I now coming to him 2,000 years later and I go forward to challenge and not for a show but for the glory of God that the men and the women and the boys and the girls who are sitting here in this little group tonight might know and believe that truly you raised up your son Jesus from the dead and he lives among us tonight and we living received resurrected to the Lord Jesus. And it confirms the scripture. It confirms the scripture that Jesus Christ now he's going to the word. Jesus Christ is the same yesterday, today, and forever. Now, now he's saying now I am standing here to accept this challenge. &gt;&gt; The very same faith. &gt;&gt; I'm coming to your address now like never before in my life. I don't believe. The very same faith that brought our Lord Jesus out of the tomb &gt;&gt; is the same faith that brother Brandham used. And by completely surrendering himself &gt;&gt; to the spirit of God and now facing now he was facing any and every demon of hell or shall I say king &gt;&gt; of the earth. &gt;&gt; He said I don't know whether it's marital problem. I don't know whether it's financial. I don't know whether it's this. I don't know whether it's that. I don't know whether it's sickness. I don't know whether it's a family problem. I don't know what it is. But I I face the challenge. &gt;&gt; And he had to use the same principle. And I'm telling you friends tonight or this morning rather, your feelings cannot get you there. &gt;&gt; Your emotions cannot get you there. You're going to have to come to the place where God said it, &gt;&gt; I believe it, and that's finished. You have to come to that place. &gt;&gt; Some of these things are withstanding us from entering into the full inheritance of the full promise. And so now out in the audience when he's saying that now I'm I'm going back just a few years. I don't go back 2,000 years, but maybe go back 50. The same thing. If it's Jesus Christ, if it's not Jesus Christ the same yesterday, today, and forever, I want to leave this pulpit, and you folks ought to go out the doors and never come back. But if it is Jesus Christ the same yesterday, today, and forever, then that's why we're here. &gt;&gt; And either this book works or doesn't work. &gt;&gt; Doesn't work. &gt;&gt; Doesn't work. That's right. And now this is the point I I don't know whether I could make it convey it. Now he's speaking to the people. Those people are facing every enemy that Satan has. You face every enemy. Some of you will face king education. Some of you will face king sports. Some of you will face or are facing king economy. Some of you are facing king immigration or every any other jurisdiction because we face what the prophet said and we're not opposed to it. We're we're called to pray for our leaders. &gt;&gt; That is true. We're called to pray for our leaders. So, there's a razor's edge between you being king, allowing the King of Kings &gt;&gt; to live in you, to be your thought and your mind. &gt;&gt; Christ, &gt;&gt; if we really believe the scripture, and I'm tying it together, Jesus said, Jesus said, Jesus said, I will be in you. &gt;&gt; Amen. This prophet knew that he would be in him. &gt;&gt; I will be in you &gt;&gt; and you will be in me. &gt;&gt; You have I'm not announcing something you don't know. You have the King of Kings within you. &gt;&gt; Then I say, "Let him rule." [Music] &gt;&gt; Let him rule. He says, "But just now, now now he's going to put this into action. He's going to implement. &gt;&gt; I want you to watch this implementation." Now, just to speak with you, he has a woman there and I'm waiting for his anointing. You know, I'm stalling. for that because we're just standing here like this. You're standing here just as helpless as can be, he says to the person. You're standing here just as helpless as can be. I never seen the woman. Could you want to put yourself in this position? And he says to the audience, "Would you want to put yourself in this position, friend?" He said, "I wouldn't either. I, William Brandham, I wouldn't want to put myself in this position either. If that angel hadn't stood out by me and said he would do it, &gt;&gt; here's the key. Now he says, "Now I believed him. &gt;&gt; I He said the second time, I believe him. &gt;&gt; Put yourself in that place. Don't know who's coming up. I I'm standing here. I don't know what your situation is. every detail. I don't know. Somebody might have sickness and is a demon of hell or demon of death trying to rob you of your health. Some might have financial problems. I'm home at your address. Some of you could have marital problems. Some of you could have whatever whatever it might be. I can tell you without any hesitation or apology, Satan, who is the prince of the power of the air, &gt;&gt; has every one of his fallen spirits up to war against you from entering your inheritance. &gt;&gt; And friends, it's already been paid for. &gt;&gt; It belongs to you. And that's the first position you have to come to. This land and the Holy Ghost is mine. &gt;&gt; It's been given to me by the author of the universe. &gt;&gt; God Almighty, the one God has said to me, if I believe on him, I shall inherit this. Does this congregation believe that? &gt;&gt; Do you believe that? Because we can't go any further until you confess and say, "I believe that." &gt;&gt; Here you've had a prophet say &gt;&gt; that Jesus believed that one scripture, I'll not leave his soul in hell, &gt;&gt; my holy one to see corruption. And the prophet said he had one verse to believe. and for healing. He said, "There's over 600." And he said to the people, I won't have time to quote it all. He said to the people, and we sit here slumbering. What's he saying? They're slumbering at its simplicity. They're slumbering at its historical aspect. They're slumbering for whatever reason. And they're coming before a prophet of God and have every opportunity. And he's only standing there because he said, "That angel, I believed him. I believed him. &gt;&gt; He said, "I'll stand with you." I believed him. &gt;&gt; Look what happens when a person believes. &gt;&gt; But now just just speaking to you. He said, "I'm stalling." He said, "Could you want to put yourself in this position?" I wouldn't. He said, "If that angel hadn't stood out by me and he said he would do it," Jesus said, "I'll be in you &gt;&gt; and I will do it." &gt;&gt; He will do it. &gt;&gt; He said some things here &gt;&gt; and I believed it. &gt;&gt; I want to believe it. I say, "Help thou my unbelief. &gt;&gt; Help thou my unbelief, Lord." But here we're here in Cloverdale Bible Way. I don't know what your position is. I don't know where you're from. Some of you may be strangers or visitors here to the church. I don't know anything about that. But nevertheless, you're a human going. You're going to run this road and run this race just once. &gt;&gt; And then the author of faith will call every life. The author of life will call every life, every person sitting in this place, small, large, young, old, whatever is this. He'll call every life to give an answer for we have run this race through life. And I want to be one and I want you to be one to say a message came by my way and I believed him. [Music] That's all I have. I I haven't got any great works to offer you. I haven't got any great things to offer you. But you said a word and I heard your voice and I believed him. &gt;&gt; I believed him. &gt;&gt; And because of that, I am what I am. &gt;&gt; Because of that, you've been so gracious to me. &gt;&gt; I believed him. &gt;&gt; And he says, "If this woman's sick and I could heal her, I'd be a brute if I didn't do it." Watch this principle he's implementing now. He says, "But if I but if I couldn't heal her, but I couldn't heal her, God's already did that." &gt;&gt; He He's saying exactly what this is in the simplest form. God's already done it. &gt;&gt; So often when we have sickness, we're afraid to say that. &gt;&gt; Here's a man. Here's a prophet of God. I can't heal you. But they're coming up there. Thousands of them want to come up. They want him to lay hand on them. And he tells them over and over and over again, "I can't heal you. You already been healed. &gt;&gt; Jesus paid it all. God can correct all wrong. He said, "I couldn't heal her. God's already did that." If it's something else, no, he doesn't know. He doesn't know what kind of king he's going to face. You following me? He doesn't know what he's facing. If it's something else, why then? He says, "God can correct all wrong." I say to you, God can correct all wrong. &gt;&gt; God can correct all wrong. if she's not a Christian. He said if she's not a Christian, God knows that I don't. If she is a Christian, God knows I don't. And now he's here. And now he's here. Now in the name of Jesus Christ, this is implementation. The son of God, I take every spirit in here under my control for God's glory. You may say, why am I reading that? Because maybe you in your prayer closet, you have to say, Lord Jesus, I know you're here now. &gt;&gt; You have come and witnessed this to me. I take charge of every situation. I take charge of every spirit &gt;&gt; that would come against me in the name of Jesus Christ and for the glory of God. Would you be afraid to do that? You may need to do that this morning. &gt;&gt; Friends, we're not here to go out and have a picnic. &gt;&gt; We're here to go out and be soldiers. &gt;&gt; What I'm seeking to do now is to arm you. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; I take every spirit in here under my control for God's glory. And now faith begins to act. Listen very close. Now faith I this implementation number one. Now, he said, "You're conscious that something's going on." And you may be sitting right here in this service. I'm not a prophet or a son of a prophet, but I have a witness to this message. &gt;&gt; And you maybe have sat in a lot of services, but you're saying, "This is different. &gt;&gt; God is speaking to me." And he said, "Now you're conscious that something's going on." That's number one. Number two, he announced you're in his presence. And somebody here, I'm not a I'm not hesitant. I'm not not apologetic to say you are in his presence. &gt;&gt; And number three, you know that something's happened just then and that was him. How does he know it's him? Now it's coming to me. Now it's coming to me. That's number four. And you are a Christian. Now he knows it. And you are a Christian. And the Lord bless you. Your trouble is in the stomach. And it's some kind of a growth. That's number six. and some kind of a growth in there, a lump in your stomach, a growth, a tumor. You're in you're in need of an operation. Number seven, but only God alone can make it for you. Is that the truth? You know, she's at the end of the road now. Whatever what taken place just now, whatever it was that's on me knows your life now. It's not just your stomach knows your life. Everyone's on me now knows you and it knows me. And I'm so submitted. Here's the key. &gt;&gt; I wanted to give the church a key. And I'm so submitted to it till I have no control of my own self. It controls me now. Friends, I'd like to tell you, I wish that this was in practice every day in our lives or in my life, but there have been times even recently where you make a decision that makes no sense. The world would never make that kind of a decision. If I don't dare go out and ask any advice because the advice would turn me completely away &gt;&gt; from what I feel in my heart that I must do. I must do it. And it comes down where the rubber hits the road. I don't know whether I should tell some of these things or not. We sometimes sit here in the blessings of God, but we don't know where the blessings come from. But I feel sometime you need to know He said, "You've got someone, some loved one you're interested in or something." Number 13. Somebody's got something with a foot. Isn't that right? It's in a cast or something. It's your husband and he's got his toes are broken or something. Isn't that right? What do you have Elijah sent to a person to try to inspire their faith and tell him you have a husband and I his foot's in a cast and his toes are broken? God almighty, is this what you're doing? Amen. &gt;&gt; Telling a poor little woman her husband's got his foot in a cast and he broke his toes. Listen friends, this is a simplicity. Don't stumble over it. And I see a streak of darkness. This is probably where she wouldn't want anybody to go. Said, "I see a streak of darkness standing between you all. You're ha you're having domestic troubles." Isn't that right? Some sort of trouble between you and you're worried about it. And by the way, you you all are separated or something. There's something between you and and that you all have separated. Is that true? 18 things and he ends up with probably the closest thing. And another thing that's on your heart, your husband, you're separated. You're having marital problems. You're separated. So, you're worried about that. In fact, is you are separated. Was that the end? No, that wasn't the end. Well, come here. What an invitation. What an invitation. Is this all true? Yes, it's all true. We'll come here. This is implementing the one phrase. He said it and I believed it. &gt;&gt; He's not implementing anything. He said Jesus didn't use of all of his glorious gifts. He didn't use any when he came against Satan. He just said, "It is written." &gt;&gt; You got a mouth. &gt;&gt; I'd like to hear it say, "It is written." &gt;&gt; It is written. &gt;&gt; It is written. &gt;&gt; It is written. &gt;&gt; Would you say that, please? &gt;&gt; It is written. And say one more phrase. I believe it. &gt;&gt; I believe it. &gt;&gt; He has said it. And I believe it. &gt;&gt; That's your greatest weapon. [Music] That's your greatest weapon. How long shall I confess it? He said, "Confess it till you believe it." &gt;&gt; And if you died and left this world confessing it, you'll have been done the best thing you could possibly do. &gt;&gt; Well, come here now, master of life. While you're standing so close and so present to do your great miracle work, I bless this woman who stands here for every need that she has need of. May it be met this night. I pronounce this blessing upon the upon under the anointing of your holy spirit in the name of Jesus Christ your son that our sister you will receive what you what she has asked for. Amen. And God bless you sister. God be with you and bless you and help you and give you everything that you have asked for. This is a person now who has come against all of these demons of hell. demons of sickness, &gt;&gt; marital trouble and affliction, all of these things, and a tumor in her stomach seeking to take her life. Here comes us. Here comes a Joshua in the form of William Brham, Jesus savior to say, "Come here. I'm going to bless you." &gt;&gt; Glory to God. Does God have the answer? has every answer. For young fellows, for teenagers, for elderly people, for you families, God has the answer for every situation. &gt;&gt; And either that God will perform his word or we die confessing it &gt;&gt; or this book is not true. &gt;&gt; I say this book is true. &gt;&gt; I say this is God's word. You know, friends, I'm going to close, but we have, and I'm far from over, but these kings, the king of all of these kings, the prince of the power of the air, has the audacity to come to your Lord, to your savior, and say, "Bow down, all worship me. He doesn't he doesn't know any shame. He's not hesitant to come to you and sew a seed of doubt. He's not hesitant at all to come to you in some nice accepting way and try to persuade you. You need to identify your enemy. I said that last week. You need to identify him. You need to identify your leader. What you're under. I'm under the Lord Jesus Christ. It wasn't William Brandham that brought this message. I can tell you one thing for sure. It wasn't William Brandham that said these 18 things. 18 things. 5, 10, 15, and three. 18 specific things to one woman that she might believe. And that was not exclusively. He was going back 2,000 years. He said he had one scripture and he believed it. &gt;&gt; He spoke to me and I believed him. &gt;&gt; That's the key. That's the key. And all you need to say, and I say with everything that's in me, identify your leader. Say, "He spoke to me and I believe him." Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And you can have &gt;&gt; you can have it. It's that simple. &gt;&gt; We can't pamper with him. As long as you pamper with him, he'll stay on your he stay on your back. &gt;&gt; You have every right to say, "Get behind me, &gt;&gt; Satan. You have no part of my home. You have no part of my life. &gt;&gt; You're not going to dictate to me. Be aggressive. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. I'm going to close now. Pilate. I know well because I thought that this might be in the minds of some. He come as son of man, son of God, and son of David, prophet, priest, and king. And brother Brown said he's king to the Jews. But he's king of kings. When he was born, the angel Gabriel told that he would be on the throne of David, his father. But the wise men came and wanted to know where the king was born. And that disturbed him. And then when it came to the time of his crucifixion, Pilate said, "Art thou a king?" He said, "Thou sayest it, and to this end was I born." And they put over his over his cross Jesus, the king of the Jews. They didn't leaders didn't like it. take that down. They said, "What I've written?" Pilot said, "I've written." He had a horrific thing even happening in his household. His wife had terrible dreams for this man said, "I've had dreams have nothing to do with this." But he blundered on anyway and washed his hands, said, "Art thou a king? Thou sayest it." We don't come with some kind of royalty. We're not coming with some kind of fineries. We come in our simplicity. Listen friends, you're sitting here in nice pews. This man sat when I was working, when I had a business before this church was established, and some of you were here. A few of you were here at that time. And we had planks to sit on with blocks of wood under it. And the planks were not planed. And I sat on those planks and I thought, wouldn't it be interesting for the bank managers and the big people downtown to see me now? But here's where here's where my son-in-law Ken Ardo was saved in that place. My son-in-law Tom Ray was saved in that place. And I tell you what, friends, this God, he's not he's not interested in just, you know, fine nice little things. He does things in his own way. And I have perhaps never told this to most of you anyway, but somebody just gave great praises to God enough to scare anybody. And I walked over to Kim just a few steps and I said, "Do you think this is for you?" He said, "I think so." I said, "Would you like to pray?" I said, "I think I would." I said, "Why don't you kneel here?" There's a old kitchen chair. He said, "Right here." They don't do that in his church. He was the organist from the church right across the street. And my neighbor was a choir leader. The lady who lived next door was a choir leader. And they would have choir practice. And now he's he's in this chair. He said, "Right here?" I said, "Yeah, right here." He turned around, knelt at the chair. I'll never forget it. He took a hold of the rungs of the chair up here was hanging onto them. And I laid my hand on his back and begin to pray. And I have to be honest with you. I wondered is this is anything going to happen? Is anything going to take place here? Everything was And then I I I felt his body shaking like that and I actually opened my eyes and he was convulsing in tears. It had to happen. There has to come a time of yielding. &gt;&gt; And his hands while he tried to hang on to the to I watched his hands as he tried desperately to hang on to the rungs of the chair, but they slid to the bottom and finally his chest. That's Kenneth Ardal. His chest was on the chair. He was born again &gt;&gt; that day. And nothing has changed from that day to this. &gt;&gt; Has it all been easy? It's not all easy. That's not what we're here for. We're here for truth. &gt;&gt; All I can tell you that Bible works. &gt;&gt; The word of God works. &gt;&gt; I challenge you in the name of Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; And it's worked for others. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; And if there's anybody here that's just hanging on the balance, don't even wait another second. &gt;&gt; I'd give myself unreservedly. I'd say that's my God. &gt;&gt; And he has spoken &gt;&gt; and I feel his presence and I'm willing to yield myself and give myself to it completely. And what the future is I know not. &gt;&gt; How many can say amen? &gt;&gt; I agree. Amen. &gt;&gt; Heavenly Father, I sense and feel that this is the time to bow our heads and bow our hearts. And I do not know what you have in store. I do not know what it is you want to do, but I ask that you'll do things that need to be done, &gt;&gt; lives that need to be changed. &gt;&gt; Oh, yes. &gt;&gt; May it take place, oh God. And I'll say, Lord Jesus, all for you, all for your glory, that you might be praised. I want to say before this congregation of people, this angel of the Lord that spoke through this vessel, I have believed him. &gt;&gt; I believe him. &gt;&gt; I believe you're the same God. And I've seen you come down over the years. I've seen you protect us. I've seen you pre preserve us. I've seen you bless, oh God, those that didn't feel they were worthy, but you blessed them. You've given healing, Father. You have given miracles one after the other. And I'm standing here tonight to give you praise and to give you glory and to thank you for all that you have done and all that you yet will do. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Father. &gt;&gt; I wonder if someone I don't need you to stand. I don't need you to do anything. But maybe you need to stand. Maybe you need to just say, "I've stood opposed too long and I've just allowed Satan to bat banter me around. Somehow this morning, I see and I hear. I see it clearly. I see it in Joshua's day. I see the people that he took in. I see it in the day of Jesus. And it wasn't always easy for them to take their inheritance. And I see it in the prophet's ministry. It wasn't always easy, but he showed us. And I see it very, very clearly the principle of simply believing. And I believed him. Oh God, let all doubt in the name of Jesus Christ, we take the sword of the spirit against a demon, a doubt that would try to invade the believer's homes and the believer's lives. And Satan, I declare that you are a liar and the father of lies. And you have no place within this message. You have no place within this congregation. You have no place. And I say to those that have confessed your name, bless, oh God. Bless now these homes. Bless these lives. Bless the single people, oh God. Bless each one in the name of Jesus Christ. Bless those that may be in need of healing. Bless those that are in need of deliverance. Blessing, oh God, I pray upon them. You've invited us. Now come here. We draw near to you. Thank you, Father. Thank you, Father. Now, my instruction to you, it's whatever he has said, just do it. Just believe him and do it. [Music] Thank you, Father. Will you stand with me? Hallelujah. What if we could sing? I'm giving myself away. Do we sing that? [Music] Brother Ryan can sing this and you can join in. I'm giving myself away on the altar. Now I'm giving my life away. laying it down on the altar.

I sense that there's perhaps some struggling with I've tried so many times. Put that out of your vocabulary. Put it out of your mind right now saying, "Lord, you have come. You have given so vivid, so clear, and by God's grace, I sought to speak it as clearly and slowly as possible that you might you might be able to not only grasp, but take in and implement. Bring it into your own soul. Give yourself away to him. Say, I'm going to yield to the spirit of God. And if the spirit of God has spoken to you today, now I'm going to just take a moment and and that you might have this opportunity to yield yourself to him. Families, I have a special place in my heart just now for families. You here with young children. And I know the struggles of that.

Help us, Father, in the name of your son, Jesus Christ, to inherit the full measure of this glorious word that you have sent. Some need, I know that there's a great need of revelation of your word, Lord. And I'm praying, oh God, create in me a hunger for your word. Create in the people a hunger for your word, for the voice of the hour, the message of the hour. Live, live, live in us, oh God. Remove every obstacle. Remove every hindrance.

Lord Jesus, what would you have me to do? Lord Jesus, master, king of our lives, king of our lives. Lord Jesus, king of my life, I crown thee now. And I'm praying on behalf of these that are holding this question in their heart. What would you have me to do? And if you're one of those, why don't you just speak that to him now in prayer? Lord, that's exactly what I've been saying. What would you have me to do? And now I ask, oh eternal one, that you will make clear your will. You'll make clear your voice. You'll make clear your presence. And I pray that even before they walk out of this sanctuary today, they will know that you heard them and you are answering them and you will give them a clear-cut answer, oh God, in the name of Jesus Christ, that they might know what decision they are to make that they might know what exactly what they are to do. And you may show them something that they have not even yet seen. and make the way clear, make the path clear, make the footsteps. And Lord, we don't have to see way far ahead, but may we just see a footstep ahead of us. And as the prophet of God has said, a bloodstained footprint, and we'll follow it, Lord. I'm following you, Lord Jesus. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Thank you, Lord. Thank you, Lord Jesus. I don't know if Brother Ryan if you know this, but I want to sing as a testimony before I leave.

And Lord, from the youngest to the oldest, Lord, we can truly say the King of Kings himself has come and spoken deeply to our hearts. And Lord, we just want to say, Lord, be Lord of every corner and crevice. We open every door to our hearts that you will guide us and lead us in your perfect will. Father, we've heard the word and now we want to implement that word within our lives. We want to do a consecration this morning. We want Lord you to live supreme. We want you to take control. We want the word to be preeminent. We want the Holy Spirit to anoint us. Lord, we want to take thus, sayeth the Lord this morning, and apply it to our lives. So, Father, as we have thirsted, you have filled us. Where we've hungered, Lord, we can say we've ate from your table. We pray, God, that you will go with each and every one of us. Let the spirit of God watch over our families on the road. We will come tonight expecting, Lord, to hear from the throne of grace one more time. Lord, we just pray that the blanket of your glory will rest upon us as we give our lives to you and say, "Use us, Lord." Whatever God you have for us this year, we want to consecrate ourselves and dedicate ourselves. Say, "Lord, use me." If you have to take the coal from off the altar, burn out the sin within our lives, let the Holy Ghost reign supreme. Lord, we're willing to say, "Here am I. send me. Use us for the glory of God. Go with us now. And Father, may your blessing be upon us as we commit now the service to you. Bring us back with expecting hearts as our dear brother Kyle will be ministering. We pray you'll anoint your servant one more time. We ask this in Jesus' name. Amen. Amen. God bless you. Greet one another. You're dismissed in Jesus name. Amen. [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] Heat.
