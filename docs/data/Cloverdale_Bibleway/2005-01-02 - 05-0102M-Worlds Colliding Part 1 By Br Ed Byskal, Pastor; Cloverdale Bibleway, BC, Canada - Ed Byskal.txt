Beautiful Christ. King of my life is he [Music] beautiful Christ. Beautiful Christ. King of my life is he. Oh, beautiful bride, beautiful bride. Keep mine ever more he shall be. Good morning. God bless you. Sometimes we go through a lot of pain, suffering, discouragement. [Music] And a lot of times we think we don't deserve it and we say, "Oh, woe is me." But this morning, if you'd allow yourself to be transported into another dimension where the inspiration came for the man that wrote these words, "Oh, what a savior." Not, "Oh, is me or woe is me," but oh, what a savior. We're here this morning because of his grace, aren't we? So when the inspiration flowed in 1948, the same time that Israel was made a nation, these words were pinned. I trust they'll be a more than just a song with words, but an inspiration to you this morning. Once I was straying [Music] in sin's dark valley no hope within could I see they searched through heaven. heaven and found a savior [Music] to save a poor lost soul like me. [Music] Oh, what a savior. Oh, hallelujah. His heart was broken on Calary. His hands were nailed guard. His side was ri. He gave his life's blood for even me. [Music] He left the father with all his riches with calmness. Sweet and soaring came down from heaven and gave his life blood to make the vilest sinner. free. [Music] Oh, what a savior. Hallelujah. His heart was broken on Calary. His hands were nails scarred. His side was ri. [Music] He gave his life's blood for dear and me. [Music] test chilly waters. I may soon be crossing, but his hand will lead me [Music] safely. [Music] I'll join the chorus in that bright city and sing forever, [Music] ever more. Oh, what a savior. [Music] Oh, hallelujah. His heart was broken on Calary. His hands were nails scarred. His side was r. [Music] [Applause] [Music] He gave his life blood for even me. Oh, what a savior. [Music] [Applause] Thanks, brother Swanson. Aren't you glad you know him? &gt;&gt; Amen. What a savior. the uh I've asked the choir to sing again this morning. I was so blessed by this song they sang uh on uh Friday night. Jerusalem. Amen. &gt;&gt; It's not a earthly city. We're looking for a city whose builder and maker is God. So maybe they could come at this time. And while they're coming, let's sing uh it's number 3028 on the screen. In Christ alone I place my trust. Find my glory in the power of the cross. [Music] In Christ alone I place my trust and find my glory in the power of the cross. In every victory, let it be said of me. My source of strength. My source of hope is Christ alone. Christ alone. I place my trust and find my glory in the power of the cross. In every victory, let it be said of me. My source of strength, my source of hope is Christ alone. [Music] John saw a city that could not be hid. John saw the city. Oh yes, he did. John caught a glimpse of the golden throne. Tell me all about it. Go right on around the throne. He saw the crystal sea. There's got to be more. What will it be? I want to go to that city he saw. New Jerusalem. [Music] [Applause] Jerusalem. I want to walk the streets that are golden. [Music] And I want to run where the angels have Jerusalem. I want to rest on the banks of your river in that city. City of God. John saw the lion lay down by the lamb. &gt;&gt; I want to know everything about that. John saw the day but did not see night. &gt;&gt; The lamb of God must be the light. &gt;&gt; He saw the saints worship the great I am crying worthy. Worthy is the lamb. &gt;&gt; I want to go to that city he saw Jerusalem. [Applause] Jerusalem. I want to walk those things that are worth. [Music] And I want to walk where the angels have terrorist.

City of God. Jerusalem. [Music] Jerusalem. City of God. City of God. [Music] [Music] [Applause] Praise God. Amen. Is that your destination? &gt;&gt; Amen. And that king &gt;&gt; of that city, he knows you by name. Amen. And he loves you. Let's sing it together. Jesus loves even me. We've got a baby dedication. Uh Jar and Joan, if you'd come at this time. I am so glad that our father in heaven tells of his love in the book he has given us. Wonderful things in the Bible I see. But this is the dearest that Jesus loves me. Oh, I am so glad that Jesus loves me. I know Jesus. [Music] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. We have a lot of wonderful things that are occurring uh not only Sunday by Sunday but year by year. And today we have our brother Jeremy and sister Joanna Brryer uh Bergen. I said that uh the way all these young couples are getting together and getting married between the few names in the families, it'll be just like a colony anymore. We get the Walders and the Stalls and the Hoffers, you know, you've got a lot of people out there in Manitoba. Isn't that right? Wherever it is. And so we have brother Jeremy and Sister Joanna. They're bringing their daughter Lana Mariah to be uh dedicated to the Lord. And uh if you haven't heard, which I don't believe I've dedicated anybody by the name of Lana, that is uh it's uh not only the name of brother Jeremy's greatg grandmother's middle name and uh or her grandmother's name and the middle name of her sister, his sister Anna. Uh, but it is uh uh the name of the national flower of Sweden. And I actually looked it up and had a look at the flower. So I know what I was talking about and I found out that uh even the name is associated with a very famous botanist uh in Sweden who did a lot of study on these things and uh it's a kind of a just associated with one of their great trees as well. uh massive tree which they make musical instruments out of and uh um make rope out of the bark and it's a very very useful tree. But so but the child we're talking about today I have some things that I want to say to brother Jeremy and sister Joanna today. Uh we hear a lot about underprivileged children or less privileged children and we hear a good deal also about privileged children and the world has a they've they've got their assessment of what is underprivileged or less privileged or what a privileged child is. So the privileged children according to some of the things which I have gathered they get a good education. This was the assessment of a Jewish rabbi. They have access to decent health care and they live in secure homes and they enjoy good nutrition and have enough clothing. But even he determined that that wasn't sufficient. I say this child has been born a privileged child, not because of any of these things. I'm happy they have these things, but a lot of children have these things, but don't have a real mother and a father. They don't have grandparents. And I understand that this child has greatgrandparents here on both sides of the family, on the Bergen side and on the Briner side. So many children today don't have parents that give themselves freely and completely to their children. Raising a child is a long-term job. And it requires that parents would lovingly give themselves freely and completely to the child. And that child then is a privileged child even though they may not have all of these other things. It's wonderful if they do have them. Plus, but if I had to take a choice between one or the other, I'd say, "Give me godly parents. Give me parents that are devoted, committed, committed, dedicated themselves first to God, and then they that will dedicate their children to God. and whether they get along on meager fair, whether they don't have access to the best education in the world, and whether they don't travel, whether they're not able to plan and and maintain a uh, you know, a family name. All of those things really are quite secondary when it comes to spiritual things. And I think this congregation will agree. There's been many that are classed by the world as being privileged children, but they end up in the later in their lives as suffering, desperately suffering and needful and lacking in many areas of their lives. When I was speaking to the school and brother Randy Timberman had asked me to say a few words. It was while I was speaking brother Randy there and I spoke out of the scripture for they have sown to the wind and they shall reap the whirlwind it hath no stock the bud shall yield no meal. If so be it yield the stranger shall swallow it up. And I thought of that scripture in reference to young people. And while I was speaking it, I thought of this dedication. I thought this child as well as other children here are privileged children because they have parents that are going to protect them and keep them from sewing to the wind so that they shall not reap the whirlwind. And as I look out over the young people of today, you see them on the streets. You see them with such an aimless, haunted look in their eyes. And our brothers who are here, who are, you know, on the police force have told me that some of the most violent are the young ladies that are 15 years old at that age group. And I thought, what a tragedy. It isn't even that little girl's fault. They've been deprived. And here we have Lana Mariah being privileged to be in this atmosphere this morning. Even though although she knows nothing about it, she's privileged that she will be guided by a godly father and a godly mother so that she will not sew to the wind and by God's grace shall never reap the whirlwind. Hallelujah. And it's on that basis I want to dedicate her in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ. Heavenly Father, it is with joy in my heart that I embrace and hold this child. And as you touched them, laid your hand upon them, you knew more about them than even the parents did. And today you knew more about this child. You gave it before it was formed in the womb. You knew it, oh God. And you gave the life, Father, that should now be expressed. And I believe that you have brought her forth, Lord, that she could express a part of the Lord Jesus Christ. I ask that you will cause Lana Mariah to be a blessing in the home. We thank you for what you've done just recently for her, Lord, touching her body and touching her system and giving her a peace, Lord, that she had not had. And Lord, I pray that you will receive our thanksgiving to you today. And as you have given her so graciously and so freely into the arms and the hearts of brother Jeremy and sister Joanna, I ask now Lord that you will see their hearts as they stand here before this crowd of witnesses saying we give her back to you Lord Jesus. Our arms and our hands will guide her and our arms will hold her and love her. But there are times when we won't be able to reach her. Then we ask Lord that you will hold her, that you will take her by the hand and that you will guide her. I pray that you'll bless her father and mother, Lord, our brother Jeremy, sister Joanna, give them wisdom, give them leadership, and I pray above all things you'll give this child eternal life in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ. Guide her to those gates, Lord, that will open. And may this family be unbroken that day at the great supper table. I dedicate Leah Lana Mariah in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ. Amen. Amen. God bless you Joanna. God bless you. God bless you, brother Jeremy. Sister Marilyn, Sister Joanne, Sister Linda have a song for us just before we turn to the word. And as they come and prepare, let's sing. We place you in the highest place for you are the great high priest. We place you in the highest place. For you are the great high priest. We place you high above all. Oh yes, Lord and we come to you inship. [Music] We place you Lord in the highest place. For you are the great high priest. We place you high above. Oh, [Applause] what else can we come to and worship? [Music] [Music] Hey, Angels appeared unto shepherds, bearing the news of his birth. Glory to God in the highest. God had come down to the earth. Shepherds sought till they found him. And wise men brought treasure and my surely one spoke to the others. We will never be what we once were. Glory to God. Glory to God in the highest. [Music] Peace and good will. Peace and good will be to men. Immanuel, Emmanuel has forgiven my sin. Glory to God. I am not what I have been. [Music] Oh, how my heart well remembers the first time I heard the sweet news of this Jesus, born of a virgin, a carpenter, king of the Jews. Though I was not with the shepherds, and had less to bring than wise men, I too have been changed since I met him. I am not what I have been. Glory to God. Glory to God in the highest. [Music] Peace and good will. Peace and good will be to men. [Music] Immanuel Emmanuel has forgiven my sin. Glory to God. I am not what I have been. [Music] Shalom bars top shalom glory. [Music] Immanuel. Immanuel say [Music] oh she [Music] has forgiven my sin. Glory to God. I am not what I have been. Glory to God. I am not what I have been. [Music] [Applause] This is our only service today. So, it isn't that we're going to drag it out, but we're not going to hurry either. &gt;&gt; Brother and Sister Swanson, so nice to see you and to hear you sing. Uh it's always such a joy. God bless you. Nice that we we have a little bit of temptation here for you now to you know to be with us sometime. Amen. Uh this Thursday we're going to be having a memorial service. For those of you that have not heard, our brother Mark Kemper passed away on Saturday. Uh believe it was, was it Saturday? Friday or Saturday? I'm sorry. I just lost track of my days. The uh service will be here in the church Thursday at 11:00 a.m. And so we would like as many of you as are able. We know that it's a morning, a work day for perhaps many, but it would be very nice for you to be here in support of our brother Lyall, sister Hannie, their family, brother Roger, sister Gail, and their family. And I was able to visit Mark a couple of times in the hospital, and he requested that we would have a service for him here in the church. And uh so we will be doing so and we're we're thankful to God for the promise that he has left us that uh we don't look upon death and passing as uh some final conclusion to things. It's a crossing over. And I certainly wouldn't want to call him back even if we had the opportunity. And I'll never forget I'll just never forget when my father crossed over. Uh a very youthful man. Not only my father but my sister Anne's father. Sharon, my sister who's not here. and he was 64, six years younger than myself at this time and hardly a gray hair in his head. And when he crossed over and I called brother McGriff to let them know and he just gave a little exclamation and said, "Praise God." He said, 'Well, you wouldn't want to call him back even if you could.' And I never forgot those words. I said, 'Now, that's right. I wouldn't want to call him back even if I could. For me, selfishly, we would like to have, but for him, it was far better where he was. So, if you'll remember that Thursday, please at uh 11:00 a.m. Now, for those of you that saw last Sunday, we were in Ghana, and I guess you saw a little bit of it. Uh we have just a few minutes of uh clip that brother Dier has taken on uh video. And uh would you like to take just a few minutes? It's it's four or five minutes at the very most. And this will show you now what the other people didn't show you. This is more the congregation and and so on. I'll just give you a little little taste of last Sunday and uh then you'll know why I'm so happy to be here this morning. Also, God bless you while you view this. Greetings from Columbia. Powerful. We have Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Nobody. Hallelujah. Praise the Lord. Hallelujah. Got to feel at home here. A lot of that what you see happening was happening while I was preaching. That brother that's all up by himself there sitting at the front. I was in the middle of the message. He just ran up and threw himself down. And some of the other people, you know, dancing around and they were just rejoicing. They get excited about the word. Hallelujah. I I think I we call that riboth as well. There was room for everybody. That's what it says in the scripture. They call it riaboth. There's room for everybody. That's what brother doa has called the new shakina translation or shakina publication. Riaboth, which means there's room for us all. &gt;&gt; And he was saying that in reference to getting the message out. There's room for us all. But they were dancing down there. Brother did Diddy. I figured that's really both as well. There's room for everybody. I just couldn't understand how they're one right behind the other and all their eyes is closed. They're going like this, you know, right behind the other. And how in the world they know they're not going to bump into the fellow, you know, if he stops. But everything just kept moving. And and then one one just got completely carried away. And I mean, he's he's taking up the space of half a dozen people. And they just make room for him. I mean, you know, they they seem to have special discernment to know this fellow needs more space. give him more room because he's going to do it a different way. And I I I just think it's wonderful. &gt;&gt; As individual as we are, that's how God made us. And we want to just be thankful and worship however God uh uh directs us. Amen. Well, that was last Sunday, so I mean, you know, have patience with me. It's a real It's a real jerk to go from one atmosphere to another. So, don't be too quiet. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Well, we're going to read some scripture. Thanks for the song, for the specials, for the choir, and I I enjoyed Matthew singing last night with Brother Jake, didn't you? My was just wonderful. I I want to hear uh I told him right away, I want to hear another one. Not next year. real quick. We need to hear one of those once a month as far as I'm concerned. &gt;&gt; I'm going to read out of uh second Peter the third chapter. And I certainly appreciate your prayers and your prayer support. And I know that on behalf of brother Tay, he asked me to give greetings to you. They were very appreciative of the reception that you gave him as their pastor. We I dedicated also a book uh that they have just done. They did I think the part three of the Daniel uh 70 week series. and uh the church here we gave a 20 $2,500 US contribution towards the printing of those books and they were very very thankful. He said that's the first time that had ever happened to them where someone had had given towards uh their work. So, I was happy that we were able to do that. And uh I want you to know that we we want to be a giving church, not just financially, but giving of ourselves and and uh hospitable church. We want to be that way. I believe that's the way Jesus was and that's what he'd have us to be. Now in second Peter the 3 chapter we'll read and these verses in part are part of brother Brandham's text to future home starting at verse five. For this they willingly are ignorant of that by the word of God the heavens were of old and the earth standing out of the water and in the water whereby the word that then was I'm sorry the world that then was being overflowed with water perished but the heavens and the earth which are now by the same word are kept in store reserved unto fire against the day of judgment and predition of ungodly men. But beloved, be not ignorant of this one thing, that one day is with the Lord as a thousand years, and a thousand years as one day. The Lord is not slack concerning his promise as some men count slackness, but is long-suffering to usward, not willing that any should perish, but that all should come to repentance. But the day of the Lord will come as a thief in the night, in the which the heavens shall pass away with a great noise, and the elements shall melt with fervent heat, and the earth also, and the works that are therein shall be burned up. Seeing then that all these things shall be dissolved, what manner of persons ought ye to be ought you to be in all holy conversation and godliness, looking for and hastening unto the coming of the day of God, wherein the heavens being on fire shall be dissolved, and the elements shall melt with fervent heat. Nevertheless, we according to his promise look for new heavens and a new earth wherein dwelleth righteousness. &gt;&gt; Let's just bow in prayer with reverence with sincerity and humility. Oh God, we come to you presenting ourselves Lord. just presenting ourselves as what we are. We can be nothing more than you allow us to be. We can say I am what I am by the grace of God. We are what you have allowed us to be. We could do nothing. We could not have even come to you or approached you had you not called us. So we thank you oh God for the call and that you have justified. You have cleansed and sanctified and you have sealed by the spirit of promise every elected son and daughter of God. We can say this morning we stand redeemed by the blood of the lamb. That precious blood that stained the earth and claimed it as your very own. And you will complete this process. Oh God, you are bringing the earth through the same process your prophet said that you are bringing each individual and cleansing us by fire by a baptism of fire that we might be a suitable dwelling place. Oh dwell in us richly we pray. Oh God dwell in us richly. Bless Lord not only those that have gathered here but those that are gathered with us heart to heart, attribute to attribute. Lord, those that far away in the invisible audience in whatever country, whatever place, whatever room, wherever they find themselves, Lord, I pray that you'll take your word this morning and cause it to be a blessing. Anoint the hearers, Lord. Anoint myself, oh God, for without you, we confess we are nothing and can do nothing. We have no ability. May the ability be that of God. We pray your blessing now as we approach your word in Jesus Christ's name. May you be glorified amongst us. Amen. &gt;&gt; You may be seated. Keep your Bibles open if you would. I would just like you to notice uh some phrases here where we began to read in verse five. For this they willingly are ignorant of that. Please notice by the word of God the heavens whereof old and the earth standing out of the water and by the word of God this was taking place. And then uh verse six, verse 7, but the heavens and the earth which are now by the same word are kept in store. So it's it's it's the word of God that are is holding things back or bringing things on. &gt;&gt; And it's reserved under fire against the day of judgment and the predition of ungodly men. So, if you'll just notice, I wanted you to notice the position and the place of the word of God. Uh, I will be reaching out into some distance. Uh, I pray that God will give us really a divine inspiration and understanding. I'm thinking in terms of uh the beginning of this year and where we're at and our our calendar. Brother Brennham talks about the various calendars in uh Daniel 70 weeks and he refers to the astronomy calendar, the Julian calendar, the Roman calendar and the Christian or prophetic calendar. And he said that I'm not going to be reading it but because of the position of the earth it cannot none of those calendars only the prophetic calendar is correct. None of the other calendars are are are correct because the earth is in such a position and it's in that position he says uh back in the days of Job and so forth that they kept time by the stars. See, they kept time by the stars. And back before that time, he said the world stood upright. So, it was in a different position. The earth was in a a little different position. And then, and then in the sin of man, the overflow of the world and it tilted and the floods came. The actual earth tilted and the floods came. Therefore, we have the great ice age and the glaciers and so forth. And he speaks of that. He says, "We we know that the earth does not sit up straight. Does not sit up. It's it sets tilted. That shook it out from where the moon and the stars were they were looking at and misplaced them. uh or you could not keep time by it anymore because it's sitting lopsided. Uh then he goes on in another continues on just a little bit. Listen very closely. It's laying back in that condition and and that only shows that this is just a period of time. It's tilted. It's lopsided. that's in that position showing that this is only a period of time. And he asks, "Can't you see God doesn't have things out of cater?" &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So this is only it's only out of lopsided as it is, off some degrees as it is, tilting back. He uses all of those phrase, but it's only that way for a time. He's just letting it run like that for a time. And I truly believe that I truly believe that that thing was done. And at this last days is when God's going to reveal these secrets to the church. &gt;&gt; Amen. He goes on, "And the spirit of wisdom comes into the church to make known to the church by the revelation of the Holy Ghost, bringing the church in and revealing what day that we're living in." Just the same as Gabriel came to Daniel, the Holy Spirit comes to the church in the last days to reveal these great deep secrets. And do you understand? Now he said, so there are are things that are dropped in. It may not be like some uh essay that you can just read through. God doesn't do it that way. If you read uh in the book of Acts and if you read Paul's writings, his epistles, he will reach back into Genesis and just take a phrase and then he'll be in Psalms and take one phrase out of one verse and then over in another chapter and another phrase out another verse and maybe out of Hosea and one phrase out of one verse. And he pieces and links all of those together and gives you a picture of what is happening at that time. And we have just such a prophet &gt;&gt; in a Leodysian church age. Now I'm just put piecing some of these things together. In the seventh stage, uh, Brother Brand was talking about the last eclipse. There was a sign in the heaven. It was a total eclipse of the moon. In the last eclipse of the moon was a total eclipse. It waned to a total darkness in seven stages. In the seventh stage, the total darkness came. Now watch this. The total darkness, the it it waned and the eclipse of the moon. Moon being church, moon being a reflector of the sun and it's a woman. And it waned and its light went completely out. In the seventh stage, the total darkness came as the pope of Rome, Pope Paul V 6th went to Palestine to make a holy tour of Jerusalem. And Jerusalem, he said, is the oldest church. And God in the heavens testified that the light went completely out when this enemy of the church went for the first time in history to Jerusalem. &gt;&gt; God declared it in the heavens. The astronomers didn't pick it up. &gt;&gt; The nations of the earth didn't pick it up. United Nations never picked it up. But a prophet picked it up. And he said to make a holy tour of Jerusalem. He was the first pope to ever go to Jerusalem. And the pope was named Paul I 6th. Paul was the first messenger. And this man goes by that name. You understand these are not the pope's names. They take those names. &gt;&gt; He said notice it. the moon or the church went into total darkness said this is it. This is the end. The generation shall not pass away until all be fulfilled. Even so, Lord Jesus come quickly. Now, that visit by Pope Paul, the first pope to ever go to Jerusalem was was January of 1964. And now we've come our 40 years. We're at a generation. What does it mean? What is this generation? There's a few during that visit. And now this present Pope Pope Paul II has made his visit recently. and to assure the Jews that uh that there was some sensitivity within the Roman church concerning the things that had happened. And the main thing was that they have been uh have have placed the responsibility of the death of Jesus Christ upon the Jews and the Jews placed it upon the Romans and that is the way that that thing has been there for 2,000 years. And so there has to come a place of unity. Now when that first visit in 1964, one generation ago, this was the basis. During his short trip to Israel, it lasted only 11 days. Pope Paul V 6th never once called Israel by name, and went out of his way to avoid using the word Jews. In those days, the Vatican saw Israel as a non-country and its people as a non-nation. Pope Paul V 6th even used the occasion to praise his mentor Pope Pas I 12th defending Pope Pas I 12th's his silence total silence during the Holocaust. never raised up one word of defense on behalf of six million people being slaughtered. And the current visit, by contrast, this current visit of Pope Paul II will be seen by many as cementing the establishment 7 years ago of full diplomatic relations between the Vatican and Israel. And here a prophet to this generation said they will make a covenant &gt;&gt; as the only preacher that I have ever heard or read that declared thus sayeth the Lord. The Vatican and the Jews will make a covenant. And the first prime minister was Goldier that went to the Vatican to commence those relationships some years ago. And now those things are are coming into fruition. Not only did this prophet say they would make this covenant, he said they will also break this covenant. &gt;&gt; If he is correct on this point and the next one and the next one and the next one, you better hear what he said about those things that haven't happened yet. And you might as well settle it this morning and be as certain, as certain as you're sitting here breathing God's fresh air, at least free air, that what he spoke is going to take place. The newspapers at during this first visit hailed the announcement of Pope Paul's visit as astonishing saying he clearly wished to go beyond the historical precedent. The pope they said was careful to stress that his pilgrimage was a purely religious act. absolutely had nothing to do with any kind of political or temporal considerations. But the visit now 40 years later of Pope Paul II was entirely different. It was for political reasons and it was for the unification of the brethren because this pope said he that he had dedicated he dedicated that 40 years ago to Christian unity especially especially between Catholics and the Greek Orthodox Church rather than the reconciliation of different religions. But 40 years later, because a prophet has declared that they will, he said, "It may sound strange, but they will take it all over." &gt;&gt; And 40 years later, it's agreed by the papers that you read and whatever newscasts you hear, it is openly declared that this pope has succeeded in bringing them all together. &gt;&gt; Now, that that hasn't been just predicted. It's been prophesied. And so, uh, we're living in it. And I say to you, young and old alike, where are we at? &gt;&gt; Does 40 years mean anything? And he dedicated to Christian unity just especially to the Catholics and the Greek Orthodox. Two years had elapsed since the second Vatican Council convened by Pope John the 23rd in 1962. which set out to dismantle they started in 1962 to dismantle the charge that Jews were responsible for killing Jesus. So that was 1962 it came into the mind of the Vatican. We've got to set in motion uh a a direction here so that the that the we can dismantle this belief in the world that we the Vatican believe that the Jews killed Jesus. Nevertheless, even though they started that 1962, Israel's statethood was still unrecognized by the Vatican. They still don't recognize the statethood of Israel. The Vatican only recognized the Jewish state 46 years after the creation of the state. They only recognized it 46 years after the United Nations recognized it like the rest of the international community. And it does not does not as of this moment today in 2005 does not recognize Israeli sovereignty over East Jerusalem. So, here's a here's a power on earth that is saying Jerusalem, we will not acknowledge that Jerusalem belongs to Israel when God himself almighty says it's theirs. This present pope, Pope Paul II, journeyed to Jerusalem in an in an attempt to heal the division between the Vatican and the Jews. One of the things too that is outstanding uh that has taken place in our time is that this present pope also was instrumental almost singlehandedly bringing down communism in a in a magazine Front Line and it's from a book John Paul II and the fall of communism. Just briefly, it said it took time. It took the Pope's support from Rome, some of it financial. It took several more trips in 1983 and in 1987. But the flame was lit. It would smolder and flicker before it burned from one end of Poland to the other. Millions of people spread the revolution, but it began with the pope's trip home in 1979 as the leader of uh Poland said that was the detonator that detonated what took place. And you have seen here in the church uh the video that we showed where the pope joined with the United States and with President Reagan and designed the downfall of communism and they did succeed. It shows them joining. Here's what a prophet said in 1961. The Jews are in their homeland for the span and space of time 40 years. The new city's been built. They're watching for what? A coming Messiah. When will it be? I don't know. When that stone smites the image here, she's gone. It's all over then. Now, notice here in the middle of the week, three and a half years. He breaks the covenant and causes the sacrifice and oblation that they will have set up already. cuz they'll go right back and say now, now he says, "Now look, you all are churches. You can be received in this image under the beast. We'll have a fellowship." He He's saying that's what they will say. We'll have a fellowship. We'll get rid of communism. We'll just wipe communism all the way out. And they can do it. And they will do it. &gt;&gt; Who who had sufficient stamina, not stamina, insight, &gt;&gt; revelation. And he said earlier, if you caught it, and God will send the spirit of knowledge into the church in the end time to reveal these things. This is what I'm reading. This is the spirit of knowledge &gt;&gt; that is informing you. And now we look back and say, "Oh my goodness, I didn't see that. I didn't know that was happening." And these things are just happening on on a world scale like world events. And there are so many things we think are world events and they're not. They are the fulfillment of the scripture. &gt;&gt; But you wouldn't even know where to look unless you had a prophet to tell you that scripture. There it is and there it is and here it is &gt;&gt; and we're seeing it. They'll wipe communism and communism at the time of 1961, 1962 happened to be the missile crisis in Cuba 90 miles off the American coast &gt;&gt; and the Russia was had sweeping Europe, African nations, India leaned to communism. When I was there, that's all you could read about in their national h the the Hindu the newspaper. They leaned towards communism. They got their help there. The Arab nations all surrounding Israel. Communism was sweeping like a flood. And every preacher, every preacher you could hear on the radio was blasting out against communism. We must preach against communism. And here stands one voice and says, "It makes me sick. to hear all that makes me sick. It's just a bluff. It's just a tool in God's hand and it's going to fall and God's going to wipe it out. &gt;&gt; I say blessed be the name of God. The God of Elijah, &gt;&gt; the God of William Brham is the God that we want to serve and &gt;&gt; believe in. &gt;&gt; And if you ever heard anything, you want to hear these things and listen to them. 40 years. The recent earthquake happened to be the largest in 40 years. And as I said at watch night, this last year was like it was uh had a book end of an earthquake on one end and a earthquake on the other. Now we're 40 years in this last year. had a massive earthquake in Bam Iran. 90% of the city gone and now what the world is coping with. This one was different. This one was not in a country. This one did destruction in 13 nations. And I had a list of them which I won't weary you with. But all of the nations that are involved, including United States and Canada and Norway and Sweden and New Zealand and Australia and South Africa, Brother Dawn and Brother Leon Gave lost an aunt and uncle in this uh tsunami. And we don't we're waiting to hear about believers, but we believe God is protecting them. That's all we can do is believe that God is protecting them. Uh is is this significant? Of course, it's significant. It is the they said it was like 750 times anything that they've had in the recent 5 years. It is every earthquake in the last five years put together. And this one's greater than all of those. They said it actually sped up the rotation of the earth, one of the reporters, he said the 33 ft tidal waves there perhaps were higher in some place. This is what he reported was described by Gordon Brown as a disaster of almost biblical proportions. This thought was echoed by the Washington Post reporter, Michael Dobs, who was swimming off Sri Lanka Island when the tidal wave flooded in. He said, "The speed with which it was it all happened seemed like a scene from the Bible." Isn't it amazing how they all turn to the scripture &gt;&gt; to identify and describe what's happening? &gt;&gt; He said a natural phenomenon unlike anything I had experienced before. Italy's National Geoysics Institute said it was so strong that it even disturbed the rotation of the earth. The last 30 years have been a dramatic increase in killer earthquakes. the most devastating to date happening on the 28th uh July 28th, 1977, 1976 rather in China when 240,000 were killed. There's never been anything like this in recorded history like this one. They said a multination disaster and it requires a multi-nation response. And there shall be signs in the sun and in the moon and in the stars and upon the earth distress of nations and for with perplexity the sea and the waves roaring and men's hearts failing them for fear and for looking after those things which are coming on the earth. For the powers of the heaven shall be shaken. Now, this prophet said, spoke of the pope, spoke of the darkening out, spoke of this visit, spoke of another visit, spoke of the 40 years, and all of these things are happening in this 40-year span. He says, "God's going to sink Los Angeles. You think this one's bad? &gt;&gt; God's going to sink Los Angeles. &gt;&gt; And perhaps this is why there's a video apparently uh I know nothing about it. I have not seen it. I It's entitled It's been titled Death by Entertainment. And it's a brief analysis of the material that's available on video and it's speaking I believe it's of a warning nature. The video gives a historical perspective. Now these people know nothing of the message. But now I'm putting out to you who are familiar with the message. And if you're not, you should be. &gt;&gt; You young people need to get into it to hear. You may think that it's just a sermon. As I said to the people in Ghana, Brother Brandham's messages are not sermons. They are announcements. They announce things that are happening and tie them to things that have happened. And you may think that you're just reading a sermon. You may think, I don't understand it. It It's not whether you understand it. It's what the Holy Spirit is putting in you so that you will understand the day that we're in &gt;&gt; and the time that we're living in. The video, this video gives a historical perspective showing how the most corrupting, the most corrupting influences in Hollywood were held back. Listen now, they were held back. The most corrupting of them were held back between 1933 and 1966. 1933, God sends a messenger, &gt;&gt; a prophet messenger to the earth with a message. &gt;&gt; And here's people who are actually writing and and developed a video of warning death by entertainment because they are so concerned of the wave of evil that has spread across the earth and stands a profit. And for those exact years in 1966, he's gone. And the relief is gone. And this is what they've said further that from 1933 to 1966, it was held back by the motion picture code which was which was produced and monitored by the churches in 1966. Now the prophet's gone right at the end at the first of 1966 he's gone. And at the end of 1966 the liberal national council of churches which the prophet screamed out against all his years screamed out against that council of churches and they they abolished this code. The churches. &gt;&gt; Can you grasp this? the churches, &gt;&gt; the National Council of Churches abolished the code so that the corruption could be released. &gt;&gt; Where are we at? &gt;&gt; And God, a holy God in heaven, has looked down upon this, and he's not going to sink that place. And a council of churches abolished this code and effectively abandoned any Christian influence on Hollywood. Listen to this. These are not believers. These are people who are dreadfully concerned because now they're being swept in a title wave of iniquity and sin and perversion and terrible wickedness and evil. And they said from that point on the floodgates were opened for violence, explicit sex, oult influences to take over and for any opposition to this to be dismissed as censorship of artistic freedom. God held it back. by a prophet's message, by the influence of one man on the earth, God held it back. And when that voice was silenced, it was let go and away they went. The average child, this is now today, the average child watches 28 hours of TV a week. The average teenager 23 hours. By mid- teen years, children have watched 15,000 hours of TV, more time than spent with teachers, parents, and friends put together. Their friend, their teacher, their associate has been a television. &gt;&gt; That's right. And by the age of 18, they've seen 16,000 murders and 200,000 acts of violence. And by the age of 11, they have watched 400,000 400,000 by the age of 11 acts of sexual innuendo primarily between non-married persons. The growing number of films and TV programs encourage young people to be involved in sorcery, witchcraft, and alternative religions. Onethird of criminals convicted of violent crime admitted that they were copying what they had seen on the media. They did a test, and I guess this isn't exactly my message, but it certainly sets a tone for it. They did a test. They took three year children, three-year-old children, put them in a room, and they w had them watching a television screen. And on the screen was introduced a little doll. And the doll was taken and caressed and cuddled and held and showed in in love. And then they took the children in the room and that doll was there. And they said everyone of the children that were in that test took that doll and cuddled it and cradled it and caressed it as they had seen on the television. And then they took the same children and put them in and they watched a watched a a film then and people had that doll there in the room and they took a hammer and beat on that doll and took those same children into another room where that doll was on the floor and every one of them took the hammer and beat on that doll. One man said, "For us to believe," and this man was from Washington DC. He said, "For us to believe that we could expose our people and especially young people to this kind of explosion of violence, sin, and corruption." This man's not a preacher. He said for us to believe that we could choke and that they can come out as wholesome young people without a life of crime. He said is for us to believe that you can take a healthy person and send them into an infirmary that's contaminated with disease and all kinds of germs and expect them to come out healthy. &gt;&gt; It doesn't make any sense. What is it? It's insanity and capital letters. It total insanity. And this has flooded from Hollywood. It's been exported in a message. Who do you say this is? He said, "We find ourselves at this Christmas." And this was 1964 and this is 40 years ago. a prophet's voice saying 40 years ago, a generation ago, now we find ourselves at this Christmas just about like they did the first Christmas. The world's just about to fall apart. And as I preached once somewhere about a Christmas message, the world falling apart. And this world again is just about to come to pieces. Look at the earthquakes over here in California. And I predict before the coming of the Lord Jesus that God will sink that place. And I believe that Hollywood and Los Angeles and them filthy places over there that God Almighty will sink them. They'll go beneath the bottom of the sea. And it's so much sin. You see, it's the barrier. Because of the sin, God is going to sink it. &gt;&gt; Civilization has traveled with the sun and it started in the east going west and now it's at the west coast. If it goes any further, it'll go back east again. And so that's the barrier and sin has traveled with civilization and it becomes a cesspool of all ages. &gt;&gt; This congregation ought to be able to say amen. &gt;&gt; And you ought to thank God that you see what you see and that you hear what you hear. And more than that, that there's something within your soul that responds to it positively. Some people don't want to hear these things. I don't only want to hear them. I want a heart that believes them. And you that have not heard them. And you young people, you want to be warned. If I don't see it, you surely will say it. I'm expecting to see it any time because we're right there. You don't want to wake up like a lot of folks today have woke up in nation after nation after nation, many nations and find themselves devastated and at a great loss and ashamed of him. He said, "I was surely standing there under that inspiration." Put judgment on that West Coast and then followed it right up here. He says, "The sinking of Los Angeles. She's gone." That's right. It will happen. When? I don't know. &gt;&gt; And choosing of a bride, which was in Los Angeles, California, 1965, his last time. said he stretched himself out further in this service than at any other time. And he closes off. He said, "Remember, one day you'll be laying at the bottom of the sea. Your great honeycomb under you right now. The wrath of God is belting right beneath you. How much longer he'll hold this sandbar hanging over that?" And science has even shown that Dr. Dr. uh Jacobs from India was here who his special his specific field of of study is the earth's crust and he described for us the actual structure of the earth's crust under Los Angeles and he said what brother Brandham said it will slide into the ocean he said is exactly correct because uh layers of the substance that are under California which is a bench they know that he said is actually similar to graphite ite you would understand the people would understand graphite. He gave the technical term to it and he said it's like graphite and when that earthquake takes place he says that bench will literally slide into the ocean. He said that holding that sandbar over there. But when that ocean out yonder a mile deep will slide in there plum back to the salt and sea, it'll be worse than the last day of Pompei. I've been to Pompei. I've seen the people with their hands and their arms all in a grotesque manner. That that dust Pompei and that heat wave that blew in there caught them. Exactly. You can see in places they still left the bodies there and they're and they're just encased in that volcanic dust. And you ought to hear what the prophet speaks about the volcanics and the volcanic dust caught them on their knees going towards the door, their hands, their fingers all stretched out. You want to go and see Pompei. And Pompei was a city of sin. Pompei was where the rich Romans went and it faced the ocean out there. And they would they were the the the the rich and the famous and the powerful within the Roman Empire would go there and their sin the the uh the paintings that are still on the wall depict their sin. You go down one street, this was the brothel. All of these places where they had their prostitutes and God and and they went there. went there to to uh to rejoice over the destruction of Jerusalem. They went there and rejoiced over the destruction of Jerusalem and God destroyed them on the spot. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; I tell you, I feel like doing a dance myself, rejoicing in the God of my salvation. What a mighty God we have. And he does all things right. I tell you, the only justice we know, we know a God of justice is going to destroy sin and destroy sinners. And if you love sin, you're doomed with it. &gt;&gt; And if you love God and holiness and righteousness, you have been set free from it. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; It'll be worse than the last days upon pay. He said, "Repent, and the rest of you, turn to God. The hour of his wrath is upon the earth. Flee while there's time to flee and come into Christ. &gt;&gt; Our time is gone. &gt;&gt; I want to preach to you on worlds in collision. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; That's where we're at. &gt;&gt; Worlds in collision. Jesus said, "I am not of this world." He said in another place, "No man has ascended up to heaven but the son of man who is in heaven." while he was standing on the earth. &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham says he was in two worlds. &gt;&gt; No one could understand him. And every believer, every bornagain believer has been born into another world. &gt;&gt; This world is demanding. &gt;&gt; This world is consuming. This world uh I is a world that imposes itself upon you that you must do certain things. You must go at a certain pace. You must be in a certain place geographically and physically involved in a certain way. But there's another world &gt;&gt; that is that is merging in colliding with this one. Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Two worlds. The one that God made and the one that we live in. And then the plurality of the two that a born again believer lives in both at the same time. &gt;&gt; Amen. I want to describe for a moment. Oh my, I wish I had I wish I had the rest of the afternoon to preach what's on my heart. &gt;&gt; But the first world, the one that God made, people have such a twisted concept. They they quote John 3:16, "For God so loved the world that he gave his only begotten son that whosoever believeth in him should not perish." It's not this world that he loved. &gt;&gt; How can he love this world? &gt;&gt; Perverted, hellbent, &gt;&gt; lovers of pleasure more than lovers of God, haters of God, feeding on iniquity in the cesspool of iniquity. That's not the world that God loves. The world that he loves is the one he made in the beginning. &gt;&gt; The world he loves is the one he's going to restore back &gt;&gt; and he dropped his own stained his own blood at Calvary and stained the earth with his own newly created blood claiming it that I will purify it and I'll bring it back to his holy state. &gt;&gt; And that's the world I want to walk in. As the choir sang, I want to run and I want to walk where the angels trod. That's the world. And it's a real world. It's more real than the one you're sitting in today. This one's passing away, but that one will not pass away. &gt;&gt; And that one is not complete till you arrive there. The principle in the Old Testament, the principal understanding of world in the Old Testament, they do not have a single word in the Hebrew for world as such. And that is why the scripture says in the beginning God created the heaven and the earth. is two separate Hebrew words to describe the heaven and the earth. And that's how the Hebrews understood it. The concept of the world to the Israelites, the concept of world, when you said world to the Israelites, it was a a combination of history and the covenant of God. and how those two elements related to their relationship with Jehovah. So it was the history, the events that had taken place along with the covenant of God and how those things together blended together how they uh are how they are in relationship with their association with Jehovah that to them was the world the covenant and the happening the fulfillment of it and their relationship with God that was the world &gt;&gt; that's not the world today &gt;&gt; that is foreign to the world today. The world on there out here today, they don't they don't have any concept of the covenant of God. They're not looking at the covenant of God in relationship to what's happening. But we have a prophet who did. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; You get as excited as you like this morning. This is something for the people of God to rejoice over. I say to the redeemed of God, you ought to rejoice. And if there isn't something in your heart to rejoice over, you ought to repent. [Music] &gt;&gt; This ought to be your joy. This ought to be your love. This ought to be your excitement. This is what you should be stimulated over. If this doesn't stimulate you, you need to be at this altar. They say, "Oh God, in this hour when these things are happening, stir me to my bootstraps. &gt;&gt; I can't I can't conceive the blindness of people that can't see these things, especially when they're spoken." And so the Hebrew understanding is quite different from the Greek which simply says cosmos. And you all know cosmos. There's a restaurant by the name of cosmos. But cosmos in the Greek is a it is the arrangement of the world. It's a harmonious or supposed to be harmonious arrangement of the world. It's the world order. Right. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Cosmos can also refer to the entire universe. And so it's a it's a broader word, a broader understanding as far as the Greek is concerned, not deeper. It's just the one single word is broader. And in the Hebrew, they actually have several words. They have heaven and the earth. And then a a second word which has to do with uh uh uh with the time span but we won't get into it just at this time but the word in the Hebrew and so in the New Testament we have cosmos and sometimes it refers to universe sometimes it refers to the world order and at other times it refers to the ages of time as they are as they progress. So it can be re referring to all of those as it says in Luke's gospel and it came to pass in those days that there went out a decree from Caesar Augustus that all the world should be taxed. So in this case it's not the universe that's being taxed and it is not the entire world of all mankind because they certainly didn't have control of them but at this time it was the the constitution or the government or or those that had control of world affairs. So and now in Genesis as I said earlier in the beginning God created the heaven and the earth. The scripture also tells us through faith we understand that the worlds were framed by the word of God so that the things which are seen were not made of things which do appear in Ephesians. and to make all men see what is the fellowship of the mystery which from the beginning of the world hath been hid in God who created all things by Jesus Christ &gt;&gt; in Matthew 13 and49 so shall it be at the end of the world the angels that's not the end of the universe that's not even the end of the framework of this earth but this earth. This scripture that I read at the beginning, please don't weary. It says it is being preserved by the same word. &gt;&gt; Now, just so you see where I'm going in case you won't be here next Sunday, that is why I read of current events where the world is reporting this this whole thing was held back. All this corruption was held back. All of this terrible evil and iniquity which was going to flood the earth and be ex and and and and and be exported out of Hollywood was held back from 1933 to 1966. It wasn't the National Council of Churches that held it back. It was the word of God that held it back. And then when a prophet came at the end and said it's over, &gt;&gt; then it was over. &gt;&gt; Then it was loosed. Then it was world falling apart. &gt;&gt; And then it was choosing of a bride also. And then it was the invisible union of the bride. And then it was who do you say this Melzdc is? And then it was third Exodus because these things were on. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. So shall it be in the end of the world. The angel shall come forth and sever the wicked from the just. I believe it's happening now. &gt;&gt; We're in another world. I'm in another world. They can think I'm crazy as they want. I that only make me rejoice. If somebody who I know is insane thinks I'm crazy, then I know I'm right where I'm supposed to be, the original world, the heavens and the earth, the divine arrangement of God, God and his children in fellowship. That's the world I'm speaking of just now. Give me just a short time and I'm going to be done. I'll I'll just break is what I'll do. I have a a spot in my mind where I want to break. The prophet speaks in oneness. The first man and the first woman in the Garden of Eden. You've heard these before, but now hear them in reference to the context of the message this morning. The first man and woman in the Garden of Eden was in perfect harmony with God so much that God could come down at any time he desired and talk lip to ear with Adam and Eve. I say, "Oh God, let that be now. Don't let this world so consume me or so consume you. Let don't let this world make so many demands on you. Don't let this world so impose itself upon you that God has to stand off. The Holy Spirit has to stand off. I can't get to them. Can't get to their mind. Can't even move them. They're so locked in. They're so encased. Oh, we want to. You say, "Well, I've got things to do. I've got work to do." Even while you're doing it, I don't care where you are. You can be God conscious. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. You can have your mind on God. What are you doing today, Lord? I want to be in tune with you. Here I am in school. Here I am in my studies. Here I am at my place of employment. Here I am doing the dishes. Here I am keeping the housework. But oh God, my soul is in tune and I am living in another world. &gt;&gt; I'm not of this world. &gt;&gt; That God could come at any time. He said, "Now that is perfect oneness, God and his creation, God speaking lip to ear with Adam and Eve." And they were so perfect in harmony with God till they were one with God. God and his family was one. I can tell you that that's I'm not I'm not just preaching something to you that is a bunch of hearsay. I have my mind on God when I'm washing my hands or whatever I'm doing. So often in the car, driving down the road, any time you can just have your mind set on God, he will keep him in perfect peace whose mind is set upon God. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen. &gt;&gt; But in this in this world, that's the world. That is the arrangement. If you use the Greek, it would be cosmos. If you use the Hebrew, he created the heavens and the earth. And in the earth he set an order and a and of things from creeping things to things in the oceans and magnificent creatures which many are extinct today. And there everything was in order and the stars and the heavens and the earth was not lopsided. Hadn't been blown off its axes yet which is and that's only set that way for a period of time. And a prophet says it'll come back again. Oh, bless God. Going to come back again because it has to be set in order. It has to be put into perfection. But that was the order that God had. And it was marvelous. None of the things that we're so uh acquainted with today were in existence in that place. and God coming down at any time and and speaking lip to ear to his children. That was the arrangement. That was perfect oneness. That's what we desire and crave for. But in that world came colliding another one. &gt;&gt; One who was well organized. &gt;&gt; Amen. one with great leaders, &gt;&gt; wicked &gt;&gt; and violent, of leaders that knew worship, of leaders that had been in heaven, &gt;&gt; of great angelic beings that fell to the earth and they were in a certain order and they had a leader. He was a master. &gt;&gt; I'm not glorifying him. Brother Brandham said he's a slipper. He said he's a theologian. &gt;&gt; He's a lover of beauty. &gt;&gt; This isn't just some wimp. &gt;&gt; It was a whole world. &gt;&gt; He had been in the presence of God. He had been at the right hand. He stood behind him. He was called the son of the morning. &gt;&gt; He was a creature of beauty. He walked through the garden of God with all the the stones of God as it were, with the beautiful colors and whatever more he was decked with. &gt;&gt; And it came that world with all of his ingenuity and all of his deception. &gt;&gt; A master of cunning. &gt;&gt; So cunning. Tell you what, you don't tackle him on your own. &gt;&gt; People to say, "Oh, I'm going to do this with my life and I'm going to be happy and I'm going to do this." Nonsense. &gt;&gt; People to say, "I don't have to listen to I don't have to listen to the word. I don't have to listen to the message. I don't have to listen to the preacher." You're doomed. &gt;&gt; You can take it on my word. You're doomed. &gt;&gt; Absolutely doomed. God has his order. He's got his arrangement. And he will He will work through no other. [Applause] &gt;&gt; Anybody says, "I'm going to have my own pipeline directly to the reservoir." You don't have it. God set his own pipeline in order. He set his own He set his own uh He has his own arrangement. He has called apostles prophets. If you ignore the prophet, there's no way you're going to receive the word. For the word comes to the prophet. The apostle and establisher of the work, the pastor, the feeder and burden bearer, a teacher of the word and evangelist goes burning out. That is God's order. And God will never change that order. And God will bless nothing that ignores that order. &gt;&gt; And that's thus sayith the word of God. He will bless nothing that is God's order. That's not brother Ed Biscll's order. I have nothing to do with it. That comes directly out of the word of God. Thus sayaith the word of God. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; There is no other way. &gt;&gt; But here he came. Here's what a prophet said about him. Now folks, I was with brother Brandham and he told me, he said, "Brother Eddie, you don't know what it's like." Sometime before I would come out on the platform, he would come to me and tell me, "When you step out, there'll be a woman up in the balcony in a yellow coat, and there's a man sitting down in the center. and the demon that's in her and the demon that's in him is going to join forces against you. But fear not, I'll be with you. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And he said, "Brother Eddie, you don't know what it was like to walk out. I'd walk out. I'd look up in the balcony and see that woman in the yellow coat and look down and see that man sitting in the middle and to know you don't kill me friends. You never convince me that there wasn't another world. And that's why when he stood there and to begin to reach into another realm, he would say, "Now I'm in another world." Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; I'm talking about a world, friends. Another place, another arrangement, a place of power, &gt;&gt; a place of infinite knowledge. [Applause] &gt;&gt; Who knew the secrets of the hearts and your problem is and your name is and where you live is here. And he knew everything about nothing was hidden in front of that infinite wisdom because it was not that of a man. It was that of God from another world. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Thank you, &gt;&gt; Lord. &gt;&gt; He fought a multitude of devils, battles with them. He said that told me that after a evening when they cast them out, he'd go home, they'd be screaming at him. Screaming at him &gt;&gt; where they had no dwelling place. &gt;&gt; Think of it, friends. It's a real place. It just it just frightens me when I see young people, young men trusting in their strength or young women in their beauty. That's a trap of the devil. &gt;&gt; What you got up here isn't worth two cents outside of God. It will only take you away from God. People think they're going to reason things out in their mind. You'll never figure out anything in your mind. &gt;&gt; You're nothing. Your strength can be gone in the next minute. &gt;&gt; God only has to call a breath out of your body and then you'll be in the presence of God to give answer for the life you live down here. And I assure you, he'll ask you what you did with the service. &gt;&gt; He'll ask you what you did when you heard the word of God &gt;&gt; and you'll stand speechless &gt;&gt; because there'll be no answer. Here's what the prophet said &gt;&gt; of this enemy. &gt;&gt; He's a slicker. &gt;&gt; He's a real wise man, educated to the spot in worldly wisdom. He's beautiful. Organized his army with worldly wisdom. He's polished. I mean, he's smart. PhD, LLD, and all the rest of it. Just as wise and shrewd as he can be. Don't you fool with him. Unless you know what you're talking about. &gt;&gt; He's a slicker. He's wisdom. He's educated. He's organized. He said he's a slicker behind the pullpit or some little Ricky with his hair combed down like a duck sitting on his back out there to harm some mother's daughter. That's the guy come around with that little cute little He describes it. He said it's appealing. Sin is appealing. &gt;&gt; That describes him. It's a whole world. It's a world of beauty. It's a world of wisdom. It's a world of reasoning. It's a world and we become so susceptible to it. &gt;&gt; It's another order, another arrangement with Satan as its head. And that world sin entered the per perfection of God's cre blessed creation. Not merely one single act of of transgression that took place, but rather an entire realm, an entire world penetrated, pierced, collided with God's world. &gt;&gt; And it came, it came in on the power of one word. &gt;&gt; This whole &gt;&gt; Don't think I'm a fanatic now. This entire kingdom, &gt;&gt; this entire world crashed and collided in a horrific collision with the world that God had arranged on one word n. And if that kingdom came and collided with this one on the basis of one word, then I say to you that God, it's incumbent upon him to send a prophet in this day with a word in his mouth to rid us of that kingdom &gt;&gt; by the power of the same word. &gt;&gt; And that is why I take those those are not merely quotes. That's That's say the Lord. And he's dismantling this kingdom and taking you into another world. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. I say hallelujah to our father. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Oh, there's so much. &gt;&gt; I'm not even started. Our first parents, they began to experience what was strange to them. That pure mirror of their conscience and their mind. now became clouded. That immediate reflection with God and communion now was clouded. And they found something strange. They found a heaviness and a weight that they' not known. They found it something they never experienced. The sadness gripped them and tears came into their eyes. They had never cried before. And the prophet says, "Now they could weep. Now they could weep." And he said, "The tears begin to come down." He's not just telling some sad tear joking story. He's telling exactly what happened. &gt;&gt; This was new to them. They didn't understand that. And he said the tears went down Adam's face and dropped onto the bosom of his lovely bride and mingled on down with the blood that was flapping against their legs with the skins flapping against their legs. And there was this tears of sorrow. They could cry now. They could weep now. They'd never done this before. &gt;&gt; And another world was being introduced. I don't care who you are. I don't care who you are. We've all known what our parents knew. We've all had that heaviness overwhelm us. We've stood, some of us beside the coffin of a loved one. We have had to say goodbye to somebody or maybe a home torn to shreds by this enemy. Let me tell you, my brother, my sister, and you that are here, and children, young people, and maybe older ones raised, and I have read some testimonies, it is so heartwrenching to read what some have gone through. And when I think of what some are going to be going through for years, I'm talking even about believers. Every one of us have known a heart that's been wretched and squeezed and tears came down our face and we cried out to God. One of my prayers, it's a consuming prayer and I don't know perhaps I'll just share it with you. It's very personal. But quite often I get very broken before God. And this is very personal now. And the words, it's hard for me to say it, but the words that come from my lips are, I'm so sorry that I couldn't do more. I'm so sorry that I couldn't be a a better servant or a better Christian. I would like to be I'd like to be able to glorify your name more. I would if you just give me an opportunity. Help me. We miss these wonderful opportunities. And it has nothing to do with works, friends. Just get that out of your mind. It has nothing to do with works. It's just wanting that relationship and that fellowship with him. And I just wish Lord because I'm so aware this is my this is our only chance. I wish I was the age of some you younger man. I wish I was the age that you are. I tell you what, you want to give every moment of your life to him because we are not of this world. &gt;&gt; We are of another world. We are in this world but we are not of this world. and death came and all of its consequences. And brother Brandham describes it in such magnificent literature. They're mortal now and they can cry now. But this world didn't only have that streak in it. It was also tantalizing. There's a aspect of it because he's a master of beauty. He makes it exciting. He makes it enchanting. Makes it very reasonable. This is the thing to do. And he majors upon your talents and your gifts and your abilities and says you can go places, but you watch where it is he wants you to go. &gt;&gt; Make sure that's the place you want to go. &gt;&gt; You can be something. Make sure that's the something that you want to be. But it's so enticing and there's so much enjoyment and as the scripture says of of of Moses that he chose to suffer with the children of God rather than to en enjoy the pleasures of sin for a season. He looked to another world. When this season is over, &gt;&gt; when the season of this little uh this little enjoyment is over, then what? &gt;&gt; And so they soon found that this became this world became filled with pain and sorrow and sickness and death. And they found also according to as as the scripture says and the world passeth away. This world is passing away. How is it passing away? It'll pass away by the same word of God that brought it into existence. &gt;&gt; Can I carry on a few more minutes? &gt;&gt; Just a few more minutes and then I'm going to close. I have a spot I want to close. and the world passeth away and the lust thereof. The Bible speaks of the pleasures of the world and that there will be lovers of pleasure. The scripture speaks of and when the seed was sown amongst thorns, he said, "And it was choked with cares." That's of this world. choked with cares and riches and pleasures of this life. Whether it be cares, there's a master. Maybe he can't get you riches. Maybe you haven't got riches, but he gives you cares and weigh it down with cares and burdens and choke choke choke the life of that seed out of you. Don't let him do it. I say in the name of the Lord, that is this world. But I'm still talking about this world. This world is laden with cares. Mark speaks of the cares of this world and the deceitfulness of riches. This world is controlled by a prince. Jesus said, "Hereafter, I'll not talk much with you. For the prince of this world, this world has a prince. &gt;&gt; He's got a plan. He's got a scheme. He's a slicker. He's smart. He's wise. He's a theologian. He's a preacher. &gt;&gt; Oh, thank God for the protection of the word of God that we have in this hour. If you didn't have the message, you'd be listening to some preacher today and he might just be a slicker bleeding for your money, your finances, this gimmick, this program for the young people. and and you young people get there and jiggle along and and have a high old time and think you're having some enjoyment and you'd be deceived and going to hell. &gt;&gt; We wrestle not against flesh and blood, but against principalities, against powers, against the rulers of darkness, against the rulers of darkness of this world. That's right. &gt;&gt; The one that we have a duality. We're living in this world, but we're not of this world. We have been born again by the spirit of God into another world. eyes in its own conceits. But the world we're in and our leader has said, "I have made foolish the wisdom of this world." Where's the scribe? Where's the disputer of this world? Hath not God made foolish the wisdom of this world? This world is filled with perplexity. They don't have answers. Even the churches don't have answers. The preachers don't have answers. It's filled with questions and questions and talk shows and the answer man and on and on we go. Am I wearing you out? &gt;&gt; This world is filled with perplexity. And there shall be signs in the sun and the moon and stars and upon the earth distress of nations. Right today there's very much distress of nations. Every radio broadcast and every newspaper, television, whatever more is filled with that the world is filled with perplexity. And that perplexity is is it's filled with doubt. That perplexity in the Greek is it means that they are without resources. &gt;&gt; They don't have the answer. Even in this catastrophic situation we have, you know, they get a half a billion dollars worth of aid, but they don't have the they don't have the the wherewithal or the infrastructure to deliver it to the people and where they are. I'm not preaching on it. I'm just saying this is just one of the massive sources of this time of doubt. What do we do? We don't have the answer. &gt;&gt; Like one man sent me an email. He said the United Nations couldn't even put on a good tea party, let alone get down food to these people and so on and so forth. Oh, that's this world. And why is it that way? People are saying, "What do I do with my children? What do we do with this family? What do we do with this situation?" My brother and my sister, the world that we come from has the answer. we that world will never run out of resources of what to do. We want to make sure we're not going by our mind that we're depending upon him. And the wisdom that comes from all mighty God has been expressed to us in the message of this hour. And then the prophet says in Thotyron church age about the pressures of this age, I'll put no other burden upon you. Each age had its pressures. And for example, the great burden of the last age is the pressure of riches, soft living, and nervous tension. We may not we may not be that mindful of it but we go and sit in our automobile. It it came from the tree of knowledge of good and evil. &gt;&gt; It is good but it's also evil. &gt;&gt; You have a radio in the house. It's good but it's also evil. &gt;&gt; Whatever it is, there's good attached to it and there's evil. You get an education that's good but Satan can anoint it and take you the wrong direction. You use it for God and God will bless you for it. Everything must be subject to another world, &gt;&gt; subject to another wisdom, another source of wisdom. &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; And the pressures of a soft age that we seem unfitted to live in. He said in this fourth generation, this fourth age seems to have had a clear-cut burden. It was to defy Rome and stand up for the word even unto death. And I would say we should defy the enemy. &gt;&gt; Defy the onslaught and the wave of this generation. &gt;&gt; It's a perverted age that we're in. It's an age of damning and cursing and terrible vulgarity. We ought to turn our backs on it. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. and stand after righteousness and holiness and be unashamed of the gospel of Jesus Christ. [Applause] Brother Brandham spoke and I'm coming now to a close but he spoke a Christmas message that time and he said the world now is about where it was when Jesus came and was born. Satan now had had 4,000 years. He was master building his Eden, gaining control. He could see how he was going to manipulate the kingdoms and how he he had a scheme in his mind, how he's going to use Rome, a world kingdom, and how he was just going to uh just change his colors and change his mask. Instead of being a pagan Rome, he'll just become papal Rome. And I'll raise up another office. Oh, it will be pompous. It will be filled. It will come to such power and glory. It just touch his hand. You understand that the nations of the world have given a half a billion dollars thus far for the suffering people down there. And you know what? The Vatican has given a voice. The richest the richest of all organizations on earth haven't given a penny yet. &gt;&gt; Just said that we should give. Right. &gt;&gt; Let all the people give. &gt;&gt; That'd be great. &gt;&gt; What good would it be for me to stand say we've had a disaster. All you people give. You have a right to say, "What about you?" &gt;&gt; And I say, "What about them?" &gt;&gt; Worth billions upon billions. They can't even total amount that they're worth on earth and haven't given five cents. &gt;&gt; I say it's a damnable system. And I hope this goes around the world on the internet and let them hear it. And I hope they're piping it right into the Pope's inner office. It's a damnable system. That's why we're against it. And the spirit that was in the church back there would defy them. And I defy that system. It's a damnable system. Rob the people and would give nothing back. Thank God I was delivered out of it. I was born in that home. I was born a Catholic. My sister was born a Catholic and we've been our mother and father. Oh, thank God we're delivered from that pain. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; She's the mother of Pilots. &gt;&gt; And the prophet said her daughters are with her. &gt;&gt; Say they're nice people. They got to come out of there. It's an image to the beast. Protestantism is an image to the beast. &gt;&gt; And Rome is the beast. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And that system is of this world. &gt;&gt; And we're of another world. &gt;&gt; And they had power. &gt;&gt; And they were in control of the then known world. They were the superpower of that time 2,000 years ago. And their armies marched proudly all through. And they had all their all their Caesars and all their various governors over this state and over this place. And their chariots marched. Oh, there was nobody like them. And they took and seized control of Jerusalem. We're in charge of Jerusalem. But God decided it was time for another world to collide. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. And it came down in a blood cell into the womb of a woman married. Hallelujah. One that they would call their goddess. But God used that womb and is bringing another world. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Hallelujah. The great I am. The great I am is coming down colliding with this world. I am. Hallelujah. The great I am with healing in his wings. The great I am. Who can say I am the resurrection and I am the life. I am the light and I am the bread that came down from heaven. I am the capstone and I am the foundation stone. I've come now to introduce a new world. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. [Applause] Hallelujah. [Applause] &gt;&gt; Oh God. Oh God. Oh God. Oh God. Oh God. [Applause] [Music] Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; The great I am. &gt;&gt; The great I am &gt;&gt; who spoke to Moses in the bush. The Elohim &gt;&gt; who came to Abraham in the tent &gt;&gt; has come to us. [Music] &gt;&gt; Just stay in the atmosphere. Stay the way you are. &gt;&gt; God took a piece of the old earth. &gt;&gt; The old earth. He knew what it was to be tempted. &gt;&gt; In that body of flesh, he to buy a body like we do, &gt;&gt; like we have. And he suffered sorrows and pains. And he had all of those. And God took that piece of clay and passed it through death. &gt;&gt; And that piece of clay came back. For in the resurrection, they went to look in the tomb, and the body was not there. It was a new earth, a new earth, the beginning of a new world. And behold, I make all things new. &gt;&gt; I make a new heaven and a new earth. [Applause] &gt;&gt; New earth. &gt;&gt; A new earth. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; A new earth rising up out of the earth. &gt;&gt; A volcanic eruption. &gt;&gt; Up from the grave he arose. &gt;&gt; And the mountain filled the whole earth. &gt;&gt; And I'll start on the next service how he filled that earth. He fills it again the way he filled it the first time. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; We are not of this world. We're in another world. Friend, &gt;&gt; don't let the devil ever tell you anything different. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Oh, I think we ought to just sing. &gt;&gt; Down from his glory. &gt;&gt; Ever loving story. My God and Savior came and Jesus was his name born as he was. Hallelujah. [Applause] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Worship him. Worship him in spirit and truth. Just before we sang on, have you bow your head in prayer? Father, we're so thankful. Oh God, I'm thankful that you have given this people. I just love them because they love your word and I know that you love them. You love them so deeply. You've purchased us and this morning we're rejoicing in your word, Lord. And I just feel trembling inside. Oh God, we want to cross over, but not before our time is fulfilled. Help this congregation and this body of people to be a mighty, mighty voice. &gt;&gt; Let them be a mighty army, oh God, &gt;&gt; standing for truth and righteousness. We give you all the praise and all the thanksgiving. I thank you for your presence with us now in Jesus name. [Music] Brother Lord, would you come please down from his glory? &gt;&gt; Lift it up to him now. [Music] My God, savior came and Jesus Heat. Heat. [Music] [Applause] Oh, how I love how I brea [Music] my [Music] [Applause] creatior. Amen. Let's prepare our hearts as well. We're going to have a baptismal now. Amen. Someone's being touched by this great creator. Amen. But let's just be praying that God would have his perfect way at this time. Amen. The second verse.

Bless his holy. Bless his holy name. For he has done great things. For he has done great things. Oh, he has done so many great things. He has done great things. Let's see his holy holy name. For he has done great things. He has done so many great things. So many great things he has done. [Applause] And you can have your seats. &gt;&gt; What a sacred moment. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; What a glorious time. Yeah, &gt;&gt; very special moment for myself to be here in the water with brother Roger Monk. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; It was the right service. He always had said to me, I certainly want I want the right time &gt;&gt; and this was the right time. The whole thought that was on my mind in regards to brother Roger and I direct these comments to him. Paul said that ye put on the new man and the new man is the theme which after God is created in righteousness and true holiness. And once again, Brother Rogers, the only way that God can create us in righteousness and true holiness &gt;&gt; is the way he did the first creation by his word. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; By his spoken word, &gt;&gt; and Paul said again in Colossians, "And hath put on the new man which is renewed in knowledge after the image of him that created him." And the word that Paul used was new as recently made. Brother Roger, I put you down into the water. Jesus came out. A different Christ than he went in. Different. The same yet different. &gt;&gt; The image will be the same when you rise, but Jesus rose with a different body. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. New, recently made, &gt;&gt; fresh, unused, which is recently made. That which is recently made is superior to that what you shall rise with, my dear brother Roger Monk, is superior to that went into the water. And I would say in a natural no one can take our place in life and spiritually speaking, brother Roger, no one can take your place in the plan of God. And I leave you with this quote from the scripture. Therefore, if any man be in Christ, he is a new creature. Old things are passed away and behold all things are become new. And brother Brandham said in this regard, "Oh brother," says stop looking at yourself and look at your sacrifice. &gt;&gt; If you can find any fault in that and the sacrifice, all right, but if you find no fault in that, then you're perfect. &gt;&gt; Because it's not you that God's accepted. If he's accepted Christ &gt;&gt; and Christ accepted you &gt;&gt; and you are dead and your life is hid in God through Christ sealed by the Holy Ghost and all the devils in hell can't turn you out of there. &gt;&gt; For you are God's property. &gt;&gt; God never looks at you. He looks at Christ. Brother Roger, would you like to just say how you God has dealt with you? &gt;&gt; Brother Ed reminded me this morning of a of a time that we were together some 30 years ago and it's made me think about that since. And each level of creation has different speeds and maturity and gestation. you know, some mice can get conceived and get born and and die within a couple of years. In myself, it's taken 30 years to get to the stage. And uh but it's a very special moment. And I couldn't be with more special people. And but the Biscals, their offspring and their family who have adopted me and been very kind and generous to me, as have most of you, as I've been here for nearly 5 years now, and I know more and more of you. I know you better and better every day and uh I thank God for that and it's a it's a wonderful family. So, thank you. Let's pray. Almighty God, divine arranger of this new world, the origin originator of this new life. You conceived it in your great thoughts and you've made them known to us. Today, Father, I want to give you a special thanksgiving out of my own heart, able to stand here with one that you brought forth into this world as we have known our brother Roger Monk. And oh God, we've seen your hand dealing with him, your voice speaking to him, touching him very deeply. And now, Father, we do know that he has repented. We do know, oh God, that now standing in the water to be baptized, identified with your death, your burial, and your resurrection, Lord Jesus. And you have said you shall give him and fill him with the Holy Spirit, that spirit of power, that spirit that raised up Jesus Christ from the dead. You are the one, Lord, that shall live in him and through him. And I pray you shall send him forth from this water, oh God, a new man in Christ Jesus, according to the promise of God. Not according to our efforts, not according to our attempts or our mental powers, but according to your promise. It is yay and amen to them that believe. We stand here today believing. And now let your presence, let your dove over us. in Jesus Christ's name. Brother Roger, according to the confession of your faith in Jesus Christ, I am baptizing you in true Christian baptism in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and into this new world which he has spoken of in Jesus Christ's name. Amen. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Praise God. &gt;&gt; Amen. Feel like dancing, &gt;&gt; brother Oette? &gt;&gt; Praise God. Let's stand together. Maybe we can sing a song together as we leave this place. &gt;&gt; Amen. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Praise God. &gt;&gt; You should be able to lift the roof off this place this morning. Amen. I appreciate when our pastor speaks from his heart. And uh song says, "Oh God, let us be a generation that seeks your face." Amen. If we could go from this place today having that same desire that our pastor expressed in his heart. Lord, what could we do for you? Amen. Let's go forth in this year seeking his face. Amen. Let's uh sing it together. Give us clean hands. Give us clean hearts. [Music] We bow our hearts. We bend our knees. Oh spirit come make us humble. We turn our eyes from evil things. Oh Lord, we cast down our idols. Give us clean hands, oh God. Give us pure hearts. our prayer. Lord, let us not lift our souls to one another. Give us clean hands. Oh Lord, give us clean, pure hearts. Let us not lift our souls to another. Oh God, let us be a generation that sees sees your face. Oh God of Jacob. Oh God, let us be a generation that sees sees your face. Oh God of Jacob, [Music] we bow our hearts. Lord, we bend our knees. Oh spirit, come make us humble. We turn our eyes from evil things. Oh, we cast down our idols to give us clean hands and give us pure hearts. Oh, let us not lift our souls to another. Give us clean hands, oh God, and give us pure hearts. Oh, let us not lift our souls to another. Oh God, let us free. A generation that sees seeks your face. Oh God of Jacob, God generation that seek. Oh that seeks your faith. Oh God of Jesus. Oh God, let us be a generation that seeks. Oh that seeks your face. Oh God of J. Oh God let us be a generation I see. [Music] What a wonderful presence this is, Lord. &gt;&gt; Lord, it's just something that we just want to turn aside. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Lift up hands. &gt;&gt; Worship. &gt;&gt; Worship. &gt;&gt; Worship a God that is real. a God that is alive and amongst his people again. Lord, we worship you this day. We've come to your house, Lord, not to be turned away, but to lift up our eyes to know that our redemption is drawing nigh. And Lord, there's something in our hearts that says, "Oh, kingdom come. Thy will be done in this earth as it is in heaven. Anoint us, Lord. anoint us to the perfect will of God within our lives. That we would only seek your face. That we would be a humble people. That Lord God that you could use us again. Lord, we're rejoicing with Brother Roger. &gt;&gt; We're rejoicing Lord that you can deal with hearts of men. And Father, if there be any this morning that feels the beckoning and the tug of the Holy Ghost, I pray God you'll deal with them mightily and bring them to the waters of life. living waters that have been opened up, Lord, in this glorious hour. Bless our brother. Fill him with the Holy Ghost and fire. Lord, we heard a tremendous word this morning. We believe it was fresh from the throne of God. We're thankful for a godly pastor. Lord, we pray that you'll anoint him mightily. Strengthen him, oh God. Let that word of God flow through him was our prayer. And father, as your people have received that word, let them tuck it within their souls, in their hearts, and God, may it become a reality to each and every one of us. Bless your people once again. Go with us, Lord. And Father, for the days that lay ahead, may the peace of God rest mightily upon your children. Father, we ask now you go with each and every one of us. In Jesus name we pray. Amen. Amen. [Music] Wow. You love the word. &gt;&gt; You love his people. &gt;&gt; Well, then greet one another and you're dismissed in Jesus name.
