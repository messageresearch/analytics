She believes." So we want to do that this morning. Uh, Sister Ruth, I'm not sure which Sister Ruth that is, but please pray for my mother who's in the hospital with flu. Just want to remember that also in prayer. And any other needs that we have, we can bring them before the throne of grace this morning believing. Amen. Let's just ask brother Dave to come.

We have breath in our lungs that we can give our God praise and glory one more time. Father, we're so grateful, Lord, to be counted in this great number, Lord, of the redeemed this morning. The blood washed as we sang of that precious blood. Lord, still can wash a sinner whose vile, Lord, is white as snow this morning, Lord Jesus. Lord, we thank you for that blood that was shed at Calvary. Lord, it just washes us every day from the filth of this world. Lord, &gt;&gt; thank you for this gathering. Lord, the requests have been lifted up before you, our sister Claire and Sister Ruth, Lord, in these needs. Lord, and we stand agreeing as a body of people this morning, Lord. Scripture says that we would agree touching any one thing, Lord. &gt;&gt; They've asked the church to pray. They've showed confidence that Lord that you hear our prayers and you we believe you do hear our prayers Lord Jesus. So we lift our voices into that great altar of incense this morning Lord and in the and our prayers would ascend into your presence Lord and something would happen in the supernatural realm and you would send forth and dispatch healing virtue to these needs this morning. Lord, we believe that's your plan, your program. Lord, we utter that on our lips, Lord, and and God, you hear those prayers and you answer the heart of faith this morning, Lord. So, we agree for those needs, Lord. Pray that you'd get glory from it, Father. And may we hear a good report from it, Lord. We pray you meet every need also in divine presence. I'm sure there's many unspoken needs for sickness and health and and Lord spiritual needs and financial needs. We just touch everyone and Lord for your word for Lord we are just so anxious to sit at your table this morning Lord as eagles Lord we pray you'd break the fresh meat to us this morning. Take your servant as you have so many times faithfully over the years and the decades, Lord, and put your word in his mouth. &gt;&gt; Anoint him. Bless him. Father, we are just so anxious to hear what the spirit wants to say unto the church this morning. Meet every need in divine presence from the youngest to the oldest. Lord, we just completely open the doors of our souls this morning and say, "Heavenly Father, feed us, Lord, &gt;&gt; from the bread of life. We love you for it, Lord. And we commit the day to you now in Jesus name. Amen. [Music] &gt;&gt; God bless you as you give this morning and just have your seats. Let's sing. What a fellowship.

I &gt;&gt; just have one announcement to make before they sing. Uh, brother Kale and sister K, brother Gil and sister Karen Ashdown would like to announce with great pleasure the wedding date of Sarah Anne Ashdown and Timothy Allen Dodd. The families would like you to join them to share their joy by extending a personal invitation to all those who attend this assembly. The wedding will take place Saturday, May 17th, 2014 at 11:00 with reception following. And due to limited seating space, there will be an age limit of 18 and over. Amen. God bless you. [Music] Through so many ders and toss of this life, I have already come. And he keeps on giving all the grace and the strength to just keep pressing on. He's given a promise and I am going to stand on every word his holy word has said. and holding his hand. I'll never fear whatever lies ahead. I'm going to make it. He's already said that I would. I'll keep on trusting that he's working everything for my good. He walks beside me and heaven is in my view. Oh, I'm going to make it through. In spite of the good intentions I've had, sometimes my strength can fade. And though I have tried the very best that I could, my weaknesses prevail. But then I remember the promise he gave that in my weakness strong. That's when I know whatever may come. His hand will lead me on. I'm going to make it. He's already said that I would. I'll keep on trusting that he's working everything for my good. He who walks beside me and heaven is in my view. Oh, I'm going to make it through. He walks beside me and heaven is in my view. Oh, I going to make it. He said I'll make it. I'm going to make it through. [Music] [Applause] Amen. Praise the Lord. Thank you. &gt;&gt; Let's sing My Hope is in the Lord. We'll ask Brother Ed to come. We've got a baby dedication this morning for um the child of Brother Dominic and Sister Astred Sangamina. If they'd like to prepare as brother Ed also comes, we'll just sing this. I stand in awe within the presence of the Lord. [Music] I stand in awe within the presence of the Lord. [Music] They knew the wisdom of the [Music] For the raing of the sea, the living, the only source of Heat. Heat. [Music] forever. His tender mercies, His tender mercies come with every rising sun to me for all to [Music] [Applause] We'll find you. [Music] Heat. Heat. [Music] [Music] forever. My is [Music] from Praise him. [Music] Let's sing that second verse again. His tender mercies come with every rising sun to me. [Music] [Applause] And you will find my home. [Music] All [Music] my [Music] forever. [Music] &gt;&gt; Amen. Isn't it wonderful? &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. You may be seated. So important to worship him in spirit and in truth. And we're going to have a a baby dedication. Our brother Dominic and sister Astred Samina have their little one to be dedicated. So we're going to invite them if they would come please. This is the second son. It's one thing to have one son, but it's real honor have two sons. &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. God bless you, brother Dominic. God bless you, Sister Astred. Now, you just come just a little way. I want the people to be able to look at you and see you. These people do things a little different. Brother Dominic came into my office and he said, "I feel it's time to get married." That's a wonderful revelation. And he said, I said, "Do you have someone in mind?" "Yes, there's a young lady and uh she's way in the Washington DC." "Oh, does she know anything about this?" No, but I'm going to tell her. And so he went and uh I had to inform them there was a church. Brother Wall's church is nearby. And uh in within a few days, Brother Dominic sends me an email says, "Praise the Lord." She said, "Yes, I got to shake hands with a man that got faith like that. Shake hands with a woman that responds to that faith." So, these two children are born into a wonderful family. Uh, the second son, Brother Dominic and Sister Astred, has named Gabriel Michael. And I thought I would just say there's we have other Michaels in the church and other Gabriels in the church, but now this couple felt to call their son after two archangels. I don't know what your thoughts were when you named your child that, but that's what their thoughts were. And uh there's been many people that have been named after other great people and many people are named after a location or a place and something I could tell you that you probably wouldn't know but brother Bud Southwick his second name is Dawson which is named after my hometown because I guess he was born there. People are named after great people, named after great places or places that mean something to them. And now you have named this son after two archangels. The scripture says, "And of Zion, it shall be said, this and that man was born in her, and the highest himself shall establish her. The Lord shall count when he writeth up the people that this man was born there. And so I am having confidence that before brother uh brother Dominic and sister Astrid named this child that perhaps the names of the archangels represent they come from a wonderful place. Number two, they dwelt in the presence of the Almighty God. Number three, their existence was for eternal purposes. And number four, I am praying that this may be the purpose of this boy, that he may dwell in the presence of the Almighty God, and that the Holy Spirit will be present with him and near him. And I know that your desire was that he might fulfill a place in God's kingdom. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; May his life on earth have an eternal purpose and glorify God. And may this son Gabriel Michael uh who announced Gabriel announced the birth and conception of Jesus Christ. And he was the first one. I don't know how he conveyed it but he said now shall call his name Jesus and from that Mary was the first mortal person to say that name. She had received it direct from this archangel Gabriel. Tell you they have important places and we're at a quite a time in history and may this son grow up. Brother Brandham was praying for a son that came up from dedication and he was started to speak about Gabriel and he said, "You announced his first coming and you shall announce his second." In all of God's treasures, that is the greatest thing. What is the greatest thing that you found? And it's like he's in a conversation. He's asking Gabriel, "What's the greatest thing that you've found?" And he receives the answer. And life is the greatest thing that there is. &gt;&gt; God has given you a life to care for. And he prayed and I'm just going to read his prayer. Our heavenly father, we come with little Michael and we place our hands upon him in dedication of Jesus Christ. You placed this in their care, in the parents care. and they know that they are insufficient without your help. So they bring their little family to dedicate them. And now I give little Michael here to you for a life of service in Jesus Christ's name. And bless the father and mother and may they live long happy lives to see their children in service of God. And we ask this blessing for the glory of God. And it's with that prayer I'm going to receive your son to pray for him and to dedicate him to God. Heavenly Father, this mother and father, our brother Dominic and sister Astrid have bought their son Gabriel Michael. You gave him to them and they may feel insufficient to care for him the way they ought to, but I pray you will guide them by the Holy Spirit. I pray that you'll give this son a healthy body, that you'll keep him strong. I pray you'll give him a mind that will understand and ears to hear the voice of the Holy Spirit. That you make real yourself to him when he comes of age. And may he sense your presence in the home, oh God. This home, this Sangamina home. I pray you'll bless it. Father, I ask, oh God, your protection upon this son. And I pray that you'll use him. May he realize, oh God, that this life has come from a sacred place. And may he come to this world for a a a divine purpose. And may he live if time shall go on to be an example to others, to his peers. And now I dedicate him to you in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and for his glory. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. God bless you, Sister Astred. God bless you, brother Dominic. Amen. Hallelujah. Well, we got a I got a text from Sister Rael Russell yesterday and informing us that her mother had been promoted to be a young woman again. &gt;&gt; Sister Semler went to be in the presence of the Lord on Friday morning sometime between 6:00 and 9. I don't know exactly when and we we don't have any more information than that but she just said that uh that we had contributed so much to their lives and to their spiritual uh spiritual lives and they just wanted us to know so if we hear anything further as we hear it we will let you know and perhaps post it on the board. Amen. So we're happy for sister Samler. We're uh certainly I I don't know if we can rejoice as much as she's rejoicing. Won't it be wonderful when when we are there? &gt;&gt; All done. All done. Uh labors and toils and but while we're here, we want to do what's right and what our very best. Amen. I'll ask you to stand if you would and we're going to have prayer and then turn to the word of God. We'll be reading out of Matthew the 3r chapter and also the 17th chapter. But before we read, let's just have a word of prayer. Father, we have been invited to pray. Lord Jesus, you even taught us how to pray that we should address the Almighty as our father which art in heaven. We say with all that is within us, hallowed be thy name. And oh God, our we express our desire not just in words but with everything that's in us. Thy kingdom come and thy will be done on earth as it is in heaven. Father, we see a earth that is filled with violence and turmoil and questions. But we pray that your kingdom come, the kingdom of trust, the kingdom of holiness and justice and equality. We pray oh God that thy kingdom come. pray you'll forgive us, oh God, our sins, our failings and weaknesses as we forgive others our their trespasses against us. And I pray, oh God, that you will be glorified. And for your yours is all of the power and the glory in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ. Now, as we turn the pages of this book called the Bible, we know clearly, Lord, that anyone with any strength can turn it, but only you can reveal it. &gt;&gt; We pray and trust that the Holy Spirit will now take, oh God, the vessels as I stand here to speak. I pray that you will anoint the word, oh God. Anoint the thoughts. I pray you will inspire the people. Father, may they be receptive to hear and more than that, may they may may they be illuminated to see, oh God, the time and the season that we are in. In the name of Jesus Christ, we look to you now, Lord, and we say, "Have thine own way, Lord. We are the we are the clay. You're the potter. Mold us as you would and glor be glorified in Jesus name. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. We pray God will bless those that are away. And yet, I don't know whether I want to pray too big a blessing on them away. I pray that God will bless them with the desire to be home, be here. Amen. But they have spring break. And I I know that's something new in in my books. I uh we never had spring break. So, uh, and I always try to arrange things so I'm home here or home at the at the post of duty, whatever that is. Always wanted to have my family in church. I think it's the best place you can be. &gt;&gt; Amen. Do I hear it from you? &gt;&gt; All right. Now, we'll turn to Matthew's Gospel. I want to read the third chapter. Uh, Matthew 3 16 and 17. And then we'll go to chapter 17 and read verses 1-5. And Jesus, when he was baptized, went up straightway out of the water, and lo, the heavens were opened unto him, and he saw the spirit of God descending like a dove and lighting upon him. and lo a voice from heaven saying, "This is my beloved son in whom I am well pleased." In Matthew 17 verse one, and after six days Jesus taketh Peter, James, and John his brother, and bringeth them up into the into a high high mountain apart, and was transfigured before them, and his face did shine as the sun, and his raignment was white as the light. And behold, there appeared unto them Moses and Elias talking with him. Then answered Peter, and said unto Jesus, Lord, it is good for us to be here. If thou wilt, let us make here three tabernacles, one for thee, one for Moses, and one for Elias. And while he yet spake, behold, a bright cloud overshadowed them. And behold, a voice out of the cloud which said, "This is my beloved son in whom I am well pleased." I want to speak on uh this is my beloved son. And this will be almost like a part two. If you're a real alert, you could perhaps make some links together with a message I spoke just recently, guardians of the revelation of the son of man. Because I would like to put the emphasis upon Jesus Christ as a son of man, as a son of God, and as the son of David. God knew that he was going to manifest himself &gt;&gt; in this vessel. And I have quite a bit to say about that. And then he was going to manifest himself and not confusing as the woman who came and cried to him, Jesus, thou son of David. And he didn't respond to her because he was not the son of David to her. Then she said, Lord, and he gave her her request. And then uh I want to also emphasize, excuse me for having you stand just another moment. I want to emphasize that if this is the son and he is the one that is revealing almighty God, then why should people look? If he is the word and they have the word, why do we look for another? or why do we become distracted to other persons or other personalities and the world is full of it. &gt;&gt; World is full of it. And I'll be saying some more about that. You may have your seats. Brother Benham said concerning the message, the message which God had called him to bring, he said, "I I may not do it, but this message will introduce Jesus Christ to the world." &gt;&gt; Amen. For as John the Baptist was sent to forerun the first coming, so is this message the message to forerun the second coming. That's just an introduction. Think about that now. &gt;&gt; So, has he been introduced or hasn't he been introduced? Now uh so if this in this message who is God. So he first was God. I just want to I want to lay a a foundation for some moments here. So he first was God Jehovah. And out of him he said, "Let's just picture now a little drama so you can get uh get it. Let's see coming out of space where there's nothing. Let's make a little white light like a mystic light halo." And that was the logos that went out of God in the beginning. That was the son of God that came out of the bosom of the father. That's what John the Baptist had said. Came out of the bosom of the father. And that was that was what was in the beginning was the word. And the word was with God. And the word was God. And the word was made flesh and dwelt among us. In the beginning was God and then out of God came the logos a part of God that went out of God. This friends is the son. &gt;&gt; This is the person. This is the person. This is the key person. Everything else that is taking place in the world is almost almost irrelevant. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And almighty God would say this &gt;&gt; is my beloved son. &gt;&gt; Hear ye him. It's really amazing that we have institutions and thousands of organizations and whatever more &gt;&gt; and all declaring to have the absolute truth. &gt;&gt; And yet God would take one man and identify him &gt;&gt; and to the people. Now it's not simple. It's not simple because for John the Baptist to be there and as far as the people was concerned here come Jesus walking who in their minds Joseph was Jesus uh father &gt;&gt; and Mary his mother don't we have them here and John was his cousin &gt;&gt; and John is standing in the water doing something that has never been done before they don't have any record in the Torah or in the in the Bible that existed at the time of baptism taking place and and someone speaking the way he was and calling all the religious leaders and righteous people and the brother Brandham says he couldn't even put their finger on their life, their father's life, their grandfathers or great greatgrandfather's life. They had had such a holy lineage. And then he says, "Ye vipers, &gt;&gt; who's going to understand that? &gt;&gt; Who's going to accept that?" And yet there was some there was some intensity and some power in what he was saying and some conviction that was backing it up and and so the people were startled and they were coming to the water and and he says behold the lamb of God that takes away the sin of the world. Tell me who's going to understand that? &gt;&gt; If God wasn't helping you then you'd never catch it. And if God doesn't help you now, you'll never catch it. &gt;&gt; That's all there is to it. There was always ample ample reason. I've been reading about this transition period. &gt;&gt; Uh the transition period from son of man which was the his prophet office to son of god. God is the spirit. So he was a son of god in the ages of the of the uh dispensation of the new testament all that period all that era son of god. And at the end of that there's the son of David. And then the prophet says, "And then just between he reveals himself again as the son of man." Jesus said that. Luke 17:30, "When you see the days of Noah again, we got them." &gt;&gt; When you see the days of Sodom again, we got them. &gt;&gt; Even thus will it be in the day not localized as it was Sodom and Gomorrah at that time or Noah at that time. But when you see the days when you see that in a global &gt;&gt; in a global manner and there nobody today that has open eyes that would that would deny &gt;&gt; it's here. &gt;&gt; It's in my town. It's in your village. It's in your community. It's all over. It's in the airplane. It's in the restaurants. It's everywhere. It's on the streets. It's in parades. It's being published about. These are those days. Even thus shall it be when the son of man shall be revealed. &gt;&gt; And now you have a prophet coming on the scene doing exactly the same thing. &gt;&gt; Appearing out of a a place of simplicity and and with a simple speech and coming amongst a common people but showing the sign of Messiah and the sign of the resurrection doing what man cannot do. Amen. &gt;&gt; There's been all kinds of prophets rise, but they don't stand there as some that I I will tell you even today before we have another baby dedication tonight. But standing there and and and telling people that standing total strangers to them &gt;&gt; and this is your name &gt;&gt; and this is your address, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; And you have a lump on your breast and and or or to someone else that you've had an operation, it didn't go well. talking to a woman in the congregation. Oh, that poor woman. You've had one, two, three, four, five operations and they didn't find out what the problem was. Feeling a compassion for her and said they couldn't find it. But that devil can't hide from God. Who's doing that? The son of man is doing that. Not don't be distracted to the vessel. And then he would even say, "Don't look at me. It's not me. It's him." &gt;&gt; And it was him that people were failing to see. Amen. &gt;&gt; Even in Moses time, in Moses time and 2,000 years or not, perhaps 1600 years after Moses was present, here come a a class of people and they they just studied the word and they studied what Moses and they studied all the commandments and kept all the commandments, kept it without flawlessly kept it. And then when Jesus, this young prophet of of from Nazareth would come and they would say uh about Moses, we we we hear Moses, this is what Moses said. And they and Jesus said, "If you heard what Moses said, you'd believe me." &gt;&gt; They spoke of what what Moses said. But then Jesus spoke about what the voice said in the burning bush. &gt;&gt; That was another person. Yeah, &gt;&gt; they were talking about Moses. &gt;&gt; But he'd say when Moses stood before the burning bush, &gt;&gt; the voice said, &gt;&gt; "I am the God of Abraham, &gt;&gt; of Isaac, and of Jacob, &gt;&gt; he's a God of the living, not a God of the dead, &gt;&gt; so it's very very significant, very important that we don't become distracted. uh we regard offices, we regard positions, we regard ministries, we regard those things and I believe it's proper to give them their proper place and then their proper respect. But on the other hand, we never want to get be distracted away from this is my son &gt;&gt; and that son was the word of God made flesh and that's what I want to get into. It is said in John 1:18, "No man hath seen God at any time, &gt;&gt; the only begotten son, which is in the bosom of the father, he hath declared him." &gt;&gt; I just want to refer to the first creation for a moment. I've got to take you on a bit of a journey and I'm going to watch my time. Adam was his first created son. Brother Bren saying this in power in power of transformation. Adam was his first created son. Jesus was his only begotten son. &gt;&gt; See, he was begotten by a woman. Adam was not begotten. Jesus had to be begotten by a woman because he came to deal with sin. &gt;&gt; But Adam was straight from the hand of God in the creation. And God's word calls for total separation. Just laying a case now. The first man, Adam, was separated himself from the word to go with his wife. That's the next step. And that questioned whether God kept his word or not. But when the second Adam was created in the womb of a woman and came to the world, he was a Nazerite to the word of God. He was separated from the world to the word. &gt;&gt; So the first one was separated from the word to the world &gt;&gt; and the second one was separated from the world to God &gt;&gt; to the word. and Nazerite to the word of God. He was separated from the world to the word. And then in thirsting for life, the logos that went out of God, the word of eternal sunship of God, the word, he's referring to the word of eternal sunship of God. The word doesn't even make sense to me. The word eternal means eternity &gt;&gt; which had no beginning or has no end. &gt;&gt; And son means had a beginning. &gt;&gt; It could be a eternal godship but never an eternal sunship. &gt;&gt; A son is one that's begotten so it has a beginning. Yes. &gt;&gt; For God so loved the world that he gave his only begotten son that whosoever believeth on him should not perish but have everlasting life. He gave his only begotten son. It was the world that needed saving friends. &gt;&gt; So God gave his begotten son. He was begotten. He was birthed. He was born of a woman. I I'm glad you're thinking. The body of Jesus Christ. Now, we're going to get into some swimming water. If you have a question, I'd be very, very happy for you to write it down. But the body of Jesus Christ was taken from the cursed earth when Adam sinned. When the serpent sub seduced the woman and sin was committed, Adam, the serpent was cursed. The woman was not cursed, but she would she would bring forth children in sorrow and in pain and in conception. But the man was not cursed. Adam was not cursed, but the earth was cursed. And then he said, "Because thou hast done this, uh, from dust thou hast come and to dust thou shalt return." And he was taken a body of the earth, &gt;&gt; cursed earth &gt;&gt; for a body. &gt;&gt; And so the germ of life and Christ is the same yesterday, today, and forever. So the germ of life in this case came from Jehovah speaking of the begotten son. The germ of life of in this case came from Jehovah God the father of Jesus Christ the great creator. And you believe that he created in the womb of this little virgin girl a blood cell that developed into the son of the living God. &gt;&gt; Amen. He was the son of the living God. &gt;&gt; Came from a a a new creation. Thus Jesus could say that thus sayeth the beginning of the creation of God. &gt;&gt; Listen friends, if that wasn't the beginning of a new creation, then then we're only part of an old creation. &gt;&gt; There has to be a new creation. And that's why there's a new birth. &gt;&gt; Amen. And a new birth is more important than the birth that brought you sitting here. &gt;&gt; We're all here because we've been begotten of a woman. &gt;&gt; We had a birth. &gt;&gt; Nobody's here without a birth. Nobody's here without a father of some kind. &gt;&gt; But Jesus, his father, was almighty God. And God began another creation &gt;&gt; through a virgin birth &gt;&gt; and brought forth a man child. And the mother would eat of the things of the earth out of a cursed earth &gt;&gt; and formed a body &gt;&gt; for Jesus Christ, the son of God. And when he was birthed, he he uh was tempted in all points like we are. &gt;&gt; He got hungry. &gt;&gt; He got tired. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He would go to sleep. &gt;&gt; He did all things that we humans do. &gt;&gt; Because he had a body. But the difference was God was in Christ. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Manifesting himself. Amen. &gt;&gt; Showing his attributes. &gt;&gt; God was a healer. Thus Jesus healed. &gt;&gt; God was a deliverer. Thus he Jesus delivered people. &gt;&gt; God was a creator. Thus Jesus created. He was manifesting. We couldn't understand this God that fills all time and space. How can we understand that? And if we could go back trillions and trillions of years, you can't understand that God had to come down and tabernacle himself with us poor humans born in sin and shapen in iniquities and show us that there is another life, there's another creation. And he stood here and it took a revelation from God to understand that that man was from another realm. &gt;&gt; He didn't come from Joseph. He came from heaven &gt;&gt; hallelujah &gt;&gt; and Mary just carried that seed &gt;&gt; and brought forth the righteous one Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; So now watch please. So the sentence was not upon Adam but the sentence was that he would return to the ground from which he was taken. That was the sentence. And that's why the second Adam had to take that earth &gt;&gt; to death. &gt;&gt; But he never turned to dust. &gt;&gt; He was one that was born of a woman whose body never went to dust. &gt;&gt; And when they went to the seurel, the body, they couldn't find the body. Why do you seek the living amongst the dead? The body was gone. He had to take the body to death &gt;&gt; and pierce death &gt;&gt; and come back victorious over death &gt;&gt; so that he could say because I live you shall live also. &gt;&gt; Otherwise those words are meaningless if he just was born of a man. But not only was he born of a of a seed, a righteous seed, but it was equally important that he should take that body &gt;&gt; of the earth &gt;&gt; which had been cursed. &gt;&gt; And so the Bible says, "Cursed is he that hangeth on a tree." He took the curse to the tree. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And the last word of the Old Testament, the last word in the Old Testament, and the last promises, behold, I will send you Elijah the prophet before the coming of the great and dreadful day of the Lord. And he shall he shall &gt;&gt; turn the heart of the fathers to the children, &gt;&gt; which is John the Baptist, and the heart of the children to their fathers, another prophet at the end of the age. &gt;&gt; Lest I come and smite the earth with a curse. &gt;&gt; The last word of the Old Testament, lest I smite it with a curse, this ministry must come. This revelation of this son, this son, my beloved son, he will be revealed in a prophet's ministry. And thus came a message in this hour. Thus came a vindicated prophet in this hour that stood before the multitudes of people and performed the same things that Jesus Christ did in his first coming. He had to do it in the second coming. lest I come and smite the earth with a curse. Because he had to reveal there was a revelation of this one, &gt;&gt; this son of man, son of God, son of David. &gt;&gt; And my message title last time was you are guardians &gt;&gt; of this revelation. &gt;&gt; You're to live it. &gt;&gt; You're to be a true witness of the true vine. &gt;&gt; You're not a witness of a denomination. You're not a witness of some Bible school. You're a witness of the true vine. &gt;&gt; He who stood here and said, "I'm the true vine." &gt;&gt; By saying true vine means there's false vine &gt;&gt; and there's others that can be grafted in. &gt;&gt; Oh yes. &gt;&gt; We're not tangelos or lemons &gt;&gt; in an orange tree. And he said, "If the prophet said, if this tree ever puts forth another bud, it'll be an original &gt;&gt; book of Acts church." &gt;&gt; And that's why I'm thankful I can stand behind this desk today and say we are seeing a Holy Ghost book of Acts church. &gt;&gt; We're seeing it. &gt;&gt; I sent email this morning to Uganda. We heard Wednesday night. Those you haven't heard Wednesday night, if you want to get on the archives and hear our brother Murphy just speak of the last three months that he spent in China. &gt;&gt; I tell you what, friends, we cannot hear that and realize that we're just hearing a little tidbit &gt;&gt; of what God is doing. &gt;&gt; Our brother's sitting up here &gt;&gt; right behind that glass interpreting this now in Chinese. And it's not this ministry. It's not this man. We are only guardians of a message which revealed Jesus Christ. And you as a church are called to be witnesses of that message. &gt;&gt; Witnesses of this revelation of Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; Things that perhaps are ordinary to you. They're not ordinary to a lot of people. &gt;&gt; And so he took the earth. The Bible says, "And out of Adam he said, because thou hast hearkened unto the voice of thy wife, and hast eaten of the tree of which I commanded thee, saying, Thou shalt not eat of it, cursed is the ground for thy sake, and in sorrow shalt thou eat of it all the days of thy life. And in the sweat of thy face shalt thou eat bread till thou return unto the ground. For out of it thou was taken. For dust thou art, and unto dust shalt thou return. There isn't anybody here that that's a shock to. We've all been to a funeral of some kind. When we're children, we don't understand. I certainly understand. And I don't want to repeat this again, but I was six and a half standing in front of my mother's casket. and knowing something was terribly wrong. Three days ago she was here. &gt;&gt; Three days ago we were a happy family &gt;&gt; and suddenly someone comes to the school takes me out of grade 1 says mother has been taken to heaven. I couldn't understand that. And somebody a woman took some big Easter lilies. It was in the springtime and broke off one and put my hands together and stuck that Easter lily in my hand. And I'm looking at this big white Easter lily looking at the gray cloth coffin that my mom at 32 years old picture of perfect health beautiful mother and glorious Christian saved out of Catholicism out of the depths of Catholic dartless and only a short time and God just took her. I didn't know a lot of things. I didn't understand all the mysteries. I didn't all I could in my young heart I remember distinctly looking at that lily looking at that coffin something's terribly wrong. &gt;&gt; This isn't what was this isn't the way it was meant to be. &gt;&gt; That's all I know. &gt;&gt; I thank God for the message. &gt;&gt; I thank God for the sign of Messiah. &gt;&gt; I thank God for the sign of the resurrection. I thank God that one who came with that kind of indication could say this is the evidence of the resurrection and this is the evidence that he who is dead is alive today not back in history today &gt;&gt; and that I could say he that is alive this is my beloved son and this is the one this congregation needs to see anyone hearing my voice that's the one our eyes must be on and he is the word He is the revealed word and he'll never be anything else. He's the revealed word. There is a message a re a message that reveals him &gt;&gt; and there's a message that unveils the serpent unveils the original sin. Unveils the godhead. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And so he says, "Out of your ground," I have to just stop or I would be preaching. "Out of the ground, out of dust thou art and to dust thou shalt return, and his body will return to the ground, but the second Adam will come to redeem it." Yes. &gt;&gt; The fallen nature, &gt;&gt; his fallen nature and the whole earth by taking a body of the earth and bringing it subject to the original nature &gt;&gt; and bringing it subject. Listen friends, when the Apostle Paul says, "I I bring my body under and and many of you that are young men and young women, I can tell you that the power of transformation &gt;&gt; by the by the living Christ who is the revealed word of God can can has power &gt;&gt; more than sufficient &gt;&gt; to keep a man and to keep a woman and to keep a family." Amen. &gt;&gt; And so God God be now I want to I want you to see you see not just not just the seed that was created in the womb of the Mary but there was a faith lineage and God gave a promise to Abraham &gt;&gt; going to give you a son. &gt;&gt; Now think please think with me. Here's Abraham chapter 18 of Genesis. He's out in the heat of the day sitting in the says three men coming. He identifies them as my Lord and two go to Sodom and one remains with Abraham. And he does exactly what's been done in public today hundreds of times. Where's Abraham, your wife? &gt;&gt; Said she's in the tent behind you. I sat in the service right over here in Port El Bernie where brother Brandham was standing there and turned his back and I've done this. He looked up at the up at the gable of the place and he said there's a man there's a man uh behind me is praying for a man that's paralyzed. I knew the man behind him. I knew the man who was paralyzed. I thought the man that was paralyzed was up in a house. That was the last place he was. The man who was sitting right beside me had visited him that morning in Port El Bernie. And brother Brandham said, "The man's not here in this city." He said, "He's paralyzed and he's in a city, I believe it's called Nanimo." He'd been taken to Nanimo that afternoon. &gt;&gt; "What is this? Is this work &gt;&gt; or is this the son of man?" &gt;&gt; Not the man. He's the vessel. Don't look at me, he said. Look at him &gt;&gt; because that's the word of truth coming out &gt;&gt; and he wheels around says, "Isn't that right, Mike?" &gt;&gt; And I knew Mike, &gt;&gt; a native brother. &gt;&gt; Isn't that right? Hundreds of times. &gt;&gt; Bombay saw it. Durban saw it. Johannesburg saw it. Houston saw it. &gt;&gt; Saskatoon saw it. Prince Albert saw it. Edmonton saw it. All over the country. all over the country. How many times like Tommy Osbborne says, "How many times do you need to say it?" &gt;&gt; He said, "I saw it once." &gt;&gt; Are you with me, friends? &gt;&gt; That's that's the vessel through which God said he would reveal the son of man, &gt;&gt; a prophet ministry. We're not prophets. We don't have that &gt;&gt; and we don't want to have the responsibility of it. &gt;&gt; But he could not be persuaded by money. &gt;&gt; He could not be persuaded by organizations. &gt;&gt; All kinds of organizations wanted for membership. &gt;&gt; He's not interested in membership. &gt;&gt; We're interested in godship. [Applause] And so God begins to prepare a body way back there, a faith seed &gt;&gt; because the sin came by doubting. &gt;&gt; And now God, listen to me real close now. And now God would take a born begotten of a woman and born in sin and shapen in iniquity. But there would be a an election within them. There would be a a seed within them. There would be a predestinated seed within them. There would be a force within them that would bring that body subject &gt;&gt; to the faith that was in them. &gt;&gt; And they believed God. &gt;&gt; I don't know why. I don't know how. But the Bible says, "And Abraham believed God." And so the Bible says this, and you know the verses real well, and I'm going to just say it quickly as you give me your full attention. By faith, Abel &gt;&gt; offered to God a more excellent sacrifice than Cain. By faith, Enoch &gt;&gt; was translated when he that he should not say death. By faith, Noah, being warned of things not yet seen, moved with fear, prepared an ark to the saving of his house. By faith, Abraham, when he was called to go out into a place which he should after receive for an inheritance, obeyed through faith also Sarah received receive strength to conceive seed. Therefore, therefore says these all died in faith, not having received the promise. By faith, Abraham when he was tried, he offered up Isaac. By faith, Isaac blessed Jacob and Esau concerning things to come. By faith, Jacob, when he was dying, blessed both the sons of Joseph. By faith, Joseph, when he died, made mention of departing of the children of Israel, and gave commandments concerning his bones. By faith, Moses when he was born was hid three months by his parents. By faith, Moses when he came to years refused to be called the son of Pharaoh's daughter. By faith, the walls of Jericho fell with Joshua uh marching around it. By faith, the harlot Rahab perished not with them that believed not. And what shall I say more? For the time would fail me to tell of Gideon, and of Barack, and of Samson, and of Jeth, and of David, and of Samuel, and the prophets, who through faith subdued kingdoms, and wrought righteousness, and obtained promises, and stopped the mouths of lions, quenched the violence of fire, and escaped the edge of the sword. Out of the weakness, out of weakness were made strong and waxed valiant in fight. In fight, turn to turn to flight. the armies of the enemies. But now they desire a better country, that is an heavenly. Wherefore God is not ashamed to call them their to be called their God, for he hath prepared for them a city. That was verse 16. Further up, I I I just replaced that. These believers These believers all confessing &gt;&gt; faith &gt;&gt; in a body cursed to dust. They did it, friends. &gt;&gt; And that's not just history. &gt;&gt; That's got to be current events. &gt;&gt; That's exactly what you've been called to. &gt;&gt; They did that because they identified. Abraham said, "God spoke to me." How do we know? What did he say? What language did we use? We don't know and we don't care. &gt;&gt; We believe God spoke to him. Amen. &gt;&gt; Who was there to prove that a voice spoke out of a burning bush? Nobody. You believe it because you you're made to believe it &gt;&gt; because it ties in with the rest of the scripture. &gt;&gt; We believe that Samuel was rejected. We believe that David was a friend of God and was a king. We believe that Sam that that Solomon essentially had almost like a a millennium. &gt;&gt; We believe those things. We believe that the Rahab was was brought forth out of her lineage, &gt;&gt; really a cursed lineage, &gt;&gt; but she married into and received the seed &gt;&gt; of Israel &gt;&gt; and became of the chosen race. &gt;&gt; We believe that. &gt;&gt; We believe that Ba Sheba &gt;&gt; was forgiven. Yes. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; He said, "We have to believe those things." &gt;&gt; Are you listening to me? &gt;&gt; Bas's wife. &gt;&gt; We don't we don't uh we don't perhaps say, "Well, that isn't within my scope of of belief or understanding." That's not for us to say. We don't say this is a criteria for everybody to live. That's not it. But she had to bring forth. She had to bring forth Solomon. &gt;&gt; None of the other wives of David could bring him bring that man forth. She had to bring him forth. I don't know how. All I'm saying is we don't know everything about God. &gt;&gt; This God is is way beyond our thoughts. This God beyond the trillions and of light, space, and mind, beyond any human mind. How can you figure that one out? We don't know how God I don't know how God works in your life and why he creates and causes certain things. &gt;&gt; I was perhaps 50 years before I really found out why I was standing in front of my mom's coffin &gt;&gt; because I learned that I had to be shuffled over here and shuffled over there and lived in 13 different places in about eight years. Move. This is your place now. This is the bed you sleep in. Okay, fine. This is the school you go to. All right. And I just became kind of numb. And then many years later, I find myself traveling over many parts of the world and India and Africa and Malawi and all of these different places. And this is your bed. And being told, you know, uh wish we had another piece. We only have one cloth on these boards. You can either sleep under the cloth or on top of the cloth. Okay. That's the way it was. My only friend, my only companion was a lizard that came and hung on the wall every night. And know we weren't there just one night. I wasn't there just for a few hours. We were there for days. But we were there because of this gospel. &gt;&gt; And we're happy to say we tried to be a true witness &gt;&gt; to the revelation of the son of man to be a guardian of this revelation. And I'll tell you what, friends, it is catching the elect. [Applause] We could tell you right here in this church, in this congregation, right from the days of the house and the days of the log church and the days how one man I walked down a pair of a set of stairways that he helped make. Brother Amy, Brother Amy was a devout Catholic and he was an alcoholic and he did everything to break that demon of alcohol. everything that was within him. And he told me when he heard of the message through his brother over in over on Vancouver Island, he said he said he he knew enough about the Bible, he even went down to Guinea, New Guinea to be on a missionary boat, a Catholic missionary boat. He thought if I just get isolated, if I just get out, I'll somehow break this thing, this terrible habit. It's a demon. Yes. &gt;&gt; And he came to the knowledge of the message and found out that a messenger had come and God had sent an Elijah ministry. &gt;&gt; And when he saw that the word of God and and the Trinity and all of these things have been so false, when he received it, &gt;&gt; he was free. &gt;&gt; I tell you what, he lived 20 years free. &gt;&gt; I took his funeral, but he lived free. &gt;&gt; Don't talk to me about it, friends. I have tried and proven that this is a gospel of Jesus Christ. Jesus Christ came on the scene and freed him &gt;&gt; and he went he called his mother and he said, "Mother, I'm free." &gt;&gt; And she said, "Oh, we've heard that before. You know, we've heard that." And he come to me all sad. He said, "What'll I do?" Yeah. She said, she said, "She doesn't believe it." I said, "Call her in 6 months." &gt;&gt; So he called her in 6 months. He said, "I'm still free." &gt;&gt; And she says, "Well, you know, I don't believe it yet." And he was really sad. them. He said, "I waited 6 months. Now what I do?" I said, "Wait another 6 months. Call her in a year." He called her in a year. They never became believers like he was, but it was a reality to him. And he told me, he said, "I" he said, with all the knowledge I had of of the scriptures. He said, "I could have argued this thing so many different ways, but he said, I knew one thing. I believed that I had faith in this God." See, he saw the son. He didn't understand everything. &gt;&gt; I was even reading, excuse me for bouncing all around, but I was reading where they start to bring accusation against Jesus Christ at this transition which were taking place of his death, his burial, and his resurrection. And he rose in this transition from son of man to son of God. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And they said they looked for witnesses and they couldn't find any. Then they found some false witnesses and they said, "What do you say?" He said, "I will destroy this temple and re up raise it up in three days." That's not what he said. &gt;&gt; You read it in the scripture. He said, "Destroy this temple." &gt;&gt; He was telling them, "Destroy this temple." &gt;&gt; Because he wasn't even talking about the temple. He was talking about his body. &gt;&gt; Destroy this temple and I'll raise it up in three days. And the temple they tried to destroy. And the word destroy is even different from other places in the Bible. He was saying, you know, he was saying uh uh free me. &gt;&gt; Set me free. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And that's what he did. &gt;&gt; He was free of the begotten body &gt;&gt; and took it through death &gt;&gt; and raised it up. The son of God. Hallelujah. He was the son of God before it, but he was in a human body for you, for me, for those people, but they couldn't see it. &gt;&gt; I say, God, give us eyes. &gt;&gt; God, give us spiritual eyes to see the hour that we're in. You think I'm just excited? I'm not excited. I'm burning up &gt;&gt; with a living fire. &gt;&gt; God, give it to you, young men. see him. &gt;&gt; May your eyes be open, you young ladies, that you see him. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah &gt;&gt; to this congregation, seeing him &gt;&gt; and all of the little things and trials in your job and this and that and the other thing. That's meaningless. [Music] &gt;&gt; Who hasn't got trials? &gt;&gt; Who hasn't got all kinds of things? You got to overcome them. &gt;&gt; The power lays within you. &gt;&gt; Not your power, his power. [Applause] &gt;&gt; And so by faith, what what was he doing? Because that 11th chapter of Hebrews takes it all the way through. All the way through. And then what finally apostle says, what can we say more? time would fail us &gt;&gt; of all of these people of whom the world is not worthy. This world wasn't worthy of them. What was God doing? God was reaching down in the dust of the earth and forming a body not of the earth but of he for he he brought people out of the earth. Abraham was out of the earth. Isaac, Jacob, Joseph, all of these. Moses, Samuel, David, Solomon, all the prophets out of the earth. But there was something within them. Their confession was greater than even the bodies they lived in. &gt;&gt; They believed in the eternal God even though they were aging. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen. &gt;&gt; And those of you that are more like myself, your hair is turning color and maybe losing some of it and whatever more, but there is a a eternal seed of eternal life. He that believeth on me, this son said, shall never die. &gt;&gt; Is that what he said? &gt;&gt; And that's what God meant. &gt;&gt; And so now we have a prophet saying this. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Every masterpiece &gt;&gt; is put on a foundation. &gt;&gt; Trying to watch my time. I'm sorry. Every masterpiece is put on a foundation. So God in preparing this masterpiece, he put it on a foundation of the patriarchs. First Abraham, then Isaac, then Jacob, then Joseph, the four corners. &gt;&gt; And now the bodywork that came that come on this great masterpiece was the prophets which was the word. &gt;&gt; They spoke thus saith who? &gt;&gt; Say it again, please. &gt;&gt; Do you believe that? &gt;&gt; They spoke thus sayith the Lord. So now God took of the cursed earth and let these bodies come and he anointed them says you'll be a prophet. You'll speak my word. You'll say thus saith the Lord. &gt;&gt; It wasn't that they were infallible. It wasn't that they didn't make mistakes. It wasn't that they were all understood. They were misunderstood &gt;&gt; and they were not popular. &gt;&gt; And Jesus said when he came, which of the prophets haven't you killed? &gt;&gt; You killed them all. and you're the children of them that killed them and you garnish and make and they they finally shined up the prophets till they were acceptable. That's not the kind of gospel we want. &gt;&gt; And so the the body part was made by the prophets for they spoke the word. He said not the law, the prophets. For the prophets was the vindicated word of God which makes the body, &gt;&gt; not the patriarchs. The prophets were the word. And the greatest of all of them was John. The Bible said so. Jesus said, "There is not a man ever born of a woman as great as John the Baptist, for he was the one that that was that could introduce the word in its fullness, &gt;&gt; the fullness of the Godhead bodily &gt;&gt; and the world didn't say, "Oh, how wonderful." &gt;&gt; They beheaded him &gt;&gt; because a little girl danced. &gt;&gt; And you'd say, "Me join that group?" Not a chance. He only ministered for a few months and he was the one who identified that prophet in that young man, that prophet in Nazareth. He was the one, look at the title, look at the death he had. &gt;&gt; People say and on the internet or whatever more say, oh, William Brighton was killed in a in a car accident. Yeah. By a drunken driver. And he had said, and you can go back in the message and find that drunken driving. He said, "A person that gets drunk and they willingly get drunk, they willingly get behind an automobile wheel and willingly drive down the highway and kill somebody." He said, "It's it it's as a firstderee murder. &gt;&gt; Did he say it?" &gt;&gt; Then how was he killed? &gt;&gt; Then how did he lose his life? Say, "Well, why would God allow that?" Tell me why God allowed a little girl to dance &gt;&gt; and run to her mother and said, "What will I ask? Who want to give be half of the kingdom? Ask for John's head." John's head &gt;&gt; to that demon-possessed woman &gt;&gt; who was living wrong, &gt;&gt; not with her husband. &gt;&gt; That the head of John the Baptist, I'd say I'm proud of it, was worth half the kingdom. and furthermore worth more than that because that was his conviction &gt;&gt; and he would not veer away from the word of God. [Applause] [Music] I was with brother Brennham. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; And he gave me the account when that wealthy, I believe, uh, dairy man in California whose wife was healed from cancer sent him a check. It was actually a bank draft or it was a letter. And he said a knock came to the door and and Sister Brandham, I guess, answered. He said, "Is Reverend Brandham here?" Yes. And so he came to the door and he said, "Uh, are you Reverend Brandon?" He said, "Yes, sir." He said, "Do you have some evidence or some proof? Could you identify yourself?" Then he was concerned. He said, "Has something happened to my son or something?" "No, no." He said, "Nothing's happened. We just need to assure that we have the correct person." And so he showed him, I think, his ministry card or something. And then they took a letter out and said, "This is a letter. Do you know of Mr. So and so?" Well, yes. He said, 'I do. I believe his wife was healed from cancer. He He's from California. Said, "That's right. He has sent you $1.5 million. That's not only $14. That's about 1960s or 1950s dollars. That'd be a lot of money today." He sent you a million and a half dollars. Oh, he said, "I couldn't accept that." He said, he said, "I I I could not accept." He said, "You don't have to accept it. It's already in your account. You just have to go and identify yourself. It's been sent here to the bank, I think, in Louisville." And he said, "Well, well, I could." He said, "A million half dollars." He said, "That drive me crazy. I wouldn't even know what to do with it." They said, "Well, that that's has nothing to do with us. They were actually FBI. They were sent with the FBI to identify the right man for this money, and he didn't accept it. And he said, "Send it back to the man. &gt;&gt; Send it back to him because I I cannot accept it." And that's what happened. How many &gt;&gt; How many television evangelists would do that? &gt;&gt; How many who have a a I will say a fake or phony or a very very cheap substitute say, "Oh, somebody's here uh here. You got a backachche." Of course you got a backachche. I got one. &gt;&gt; We all got back. You have trouble in your knee. How many people have trouble in their knee? Well, of course, all kinds of people have trouble in their knee. That's not what this was. [Applause] This was to prove to this generation that Jesus Christ &gt;&gt; who went to the tomb &gt;&gt; took the body of this earth &gt;&gt; through death &gt;&gt; and brought it back, &gt;&gt; a changed body, &gt;&gt; a transformed body and say that we will have a glorious body like his body. &gt;&gt; Do you want it? &gt;&gt; Do you want it, folks? That's what this gospel is all about. &gt;&gt; That's what this message is all about. This isn't a hope so. &gt;&gt; This is it shall be so. &gt;&gt; This is my beloved son. [Music] &gt;&gt; Hear ye him. &gt;&gt; And this son also knew to speak. &gt;&gt; He also knew to be silent. And when they even misqued him and said, he said, "I will destroy this temple and I'll raise it up in three days." &gt;&gt; They asked him, "Dust thou not answer?" And he answered him, "Not a word." &gt;&gt; You can't make a believer out of an unbeliever. &gt;&gt; You might say, "Well, well, just a second. Just a second. We all were unbelievers." Well, yeah, but we were made to believe. when the light struck your soul. &gt;&gt; You believed &gt;&gt; and you might have even said to yourself, why am I believing this &gt;&gt; because truth &gt;&gt; truth registers &gt;&gt; in one's heart. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And then finally came and the greatest of all of them was John. And then finally came the great head, the head of all of it. The rest of the body just spoke of it. Abraham spoke of it. Isaac spoke of it of a promised son. Joseph, the son of prosperity, spoke of it. David, the king, spoke of it. They all spoke of it. But he was it. Finally, he came. Finally, the masterpiece came &gt;&gt; and the rest of the body spoke of it. The foundation was laid by the patriarchs, but the body was built by the word which was the prophets. And here comes the head of it all. Jesus came on the scene. We find in him the perfect reflection of the word for he was the word, the fullness of the word. Now again God has a masterpiece &gt;&gt; again &gt;&gt; friends the masterpiece he this beloved son could not be here in his fullness as long as the seals were not open as long as there was mysteries still unveiled but that's why he had to come and take the book and loose the seals and say and say here I am &gt;&gt; here I am. &gt;&gt; Love me or hate me, but here I am. &gt;&gt; And that's what he did when he opened up the seals and declared those things which have been hidden from the beginning before the foundation of the world. God held it in his mind. And what he held in his mind, the prophet in Christ the mystery, God revealed. He tells what he wanted to do. What God wanted to do, he wanted to reveal himself. He wanted to reveal himself so desperately nothing can stop him. Death can't stop him. And the fact is, I'll curse the earth, but I'll use that earth. &gt;&gt; I'll make that earth confess &gt;&gt; eternal things, &gt;&gt; and I'll unfold myself in a body of cursed earth, and I'll take it to the curse, &gt;&gt; and I'll raise it up again &gt;&gt; into the original form &gt;&gt; that I had in my mind. Believest thou this. &gt;&gt; Hello. Believest thou this. [Applause] &gt;&gt; That's what this message is all about. &gt;&gt; This message came &gt;&gt; from heaven. &gt;&gt; He the son came from heaven. &gt;&gt; That's why he said in John 3, even so, the son of man who is in heaven standing right on the earth. Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; That's why the prophet of God stood right here. He said, "In another dimension. I'm in another world right now." Oh, how I thank God for that. &gt;&gt; And I believe it with all my heart, friends. &gt;&gt; It touches me very deep. I I I knelt in this study today before coming here thanking him &gt;&gt; that I could sense and feel his presence &gt;&gt; and let him know how I love that presence. Amen. &gt;&gt; I don't just say a man telling someone some things and getting enthused about that. I sense him. &gt;&gt; That's the son, &gt;&gt; my beloved son. &gt;&gt; And when you love the word of God revealed, listen, &gt;&gt; when you love the word of God revealed, &gt;&gt; you are loving the son who was the full object of the father's love. Hello kids. Did you hear that? &gt;&gt; Not just a sermon. I'm just telling you some things. This whole congregation, the whole purpose of all of these years is to tell people in the day when the son Jesus himself the son saying when you see these conditions again &gt;&gt; and you confess yourself they are here &gt;&gt; you girls are in university you young men you're in university isn't it Oh, &gt;&gt; you kids in high school, your parents are walking the shops. And I can tell you friends, someday, someday we may feel a whole lot more pressure. The whole gay community, I don't call it a gay community. To me, there's nothing gay about it at all. It's unclean. &gt;&gt; Absolutely unclean. &gt;&gt; You folks ought to be able to say amen to that. &gt;&gt; It's vile and unclean. &gt;&gt; Look what they do with the seed. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; The seed. The seed is so precious to God. &gt;&gt; He's the giver of life. Look what they do with it &gt;&gt; in utter disdain. Amen. &gt;&gt; Put a mockery to God. &gt;&gt; But when that time comes, &gt;&gt; even thus shall it be when the son of man, he was the son of man standing on the earth. Even thus, he was pointing to a forward time. Even thus shall it be when the son of man is again revealed. &gt;&gt; Just so happened God knew you were going to be born at this season. God knew you were going to be here &gt;&gt; and God knew that he would cast a light your way. Somebody would bring it your way and and and uh would would the light would illuminate you within. &gt;&gt; Come on, friends. &gt;&gt; We're done with just being, you know, &gt;&gt; having a having a soother in the mouth. &gt;&gt; It's time for men and women to stand up and declare their physician &gt;&gt; and they come subtle and maybe say, "You know what? Uh, we'll take away your charity status. We will not give receipts anymore for tax deductions." And they start putting the screws down. Then what happens? &gt;&gt; Nothing happens. &gt;&gt; Absolutely nothing happens. &gt;&gt; We're not here because we get a tax receipt. &gt;&gt; We're here because we heard a voice. &gt;&gt; We heard a man. This man. &gt;&gt; That's why we're here. &gt;&gt; Have you heard him? &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Thank you. God bless. Can I have a few more moments, please? &gt;&gt; I realize I'm not preaching to a Sunday school picnic. &gt;&gt; And the spirit of Elijah was to forrun the victorious coming of the righteous one. &gt;&gt; It says in Malachi, "And he shall turn the heart of the fathers to the children, and the heart of the children to their fathers, lest I come and smite the earth with a curse, or that is completely destroy or dedicate for destruction. And then in Acts the 7th chapter uh in that glorious message they I believe it's Stephen that is speaking which of the prophets have have not your fathers persecuted and they have slain them which showed before of the coming of the just one. Even when they showed before of the coming of the just one they killed them &gt;&gt; for speaking of it. Listen friends, Jesus, your Lord and Savior, said, "The world has hated me &gt;&gt; and it will hate you." &gt;&gt; Is that what he said? expect to, you know, win any accolades over this, but nevertheless, I'm going to just say what's on my heart if you can give me another few minutes. And so, forming out of the cursed earth a body that God himself would indwell, and through him will become the final and ultimate sacrifice for sin. Galatians 3:13, Christ hath redeemed us from the curse of the law, being made a curse for us. For it is written, cursed is everyone that hangeth on a tree. So when this masterpiece was perfected, then he had to smite it. He God had to smite it. &gt;&gt; The world argues whether the Jews killed him or the Gentiles killed him or the Romans killed him. God let him be slain. God slew him because that was God in Christ &gt;&gt; taking the body that had been cursed and the soul that could not approach God without the blood atonement. And he says so when this masterpiece was perfected in the masterpiece and then he had to smite it to take from him another piece not another creation but of the same creation. Now I'm speaking of your beginnings. &gt;&gt; You are a new creation, God. But this is where you came from. And if he took from him the original creation to make the bride for him, he never made another creation. When Adam was put to sleep, the first Adam and a rib was taken from him. It was taken from him. It wasn't another creation. It was part of that original creation. &gt;&gt; And now he who was on the cross hanging for us, he was hanging there because he was the word &gt;&gt; because he was the word of God expressed. &gt;&gt; And that's why they hated him because he was the word. &gt;&gt; And here we have now a messenger in this day said, "It isn't me that they hate, &gt;&gt; it's the message." &gt;&gt; They didn't want to hear that. This is just one God. Here you Israel, your God is one God. He's in three three offices. He's in the fatherhood. He's in the sunship. And he is this Holy Spirit. He's a spirit. &gt;&gt; God is a spirit. The Bible say, does it say it? &gt;&gt; It's so simple, friends. And people, they just, you know, they stumble over it willingly. &gt;&gt; I've said to trinitarians, "How many are you going to see when you get there?" Well, they said, "One." I said, 'Excuse me, you have three persons down here and you're going to see one. How does that work? &gt;&gt; The man that led me into the ministry, he said, 'Well, I I could only see two. &gt;&gt; So, I was a young minister and I met I met the prophet of God. I'd been baptized in the name of Father, Son, and Holy Ghost. That's what the Bible said. &gt;&gt; That's the way I was baptized. &gt;&gt; And uh God had, don't ask me, I don't know, three, yeah, we believe in the Trinity. Uh, how many are there? Well, I don't know. I think that there's just one, but anyway, because I read the scripture here, oh, Israel, your God is one, right? &gt;&gt; So, I thought, well, you know, but but here's Jesus on earth and all of these things that everybody. So, then I sat sat with the prophet of God and asked him, you know, I didn't even ask him. And he just said, it's the same God in three offices. Wow. You're just all over. Of course. &gt;&gt; Of course. Who who who can imagine who can plum the depths of almighty God? So God and and the prophet said in Christ is the mystery of God revealed. He said the first thing was God wanted listen this very closely now absorb it please. Yes. &gt;&gt; The first thing that God wanted to reveal himself to the people. That's the first thing. God, this great being. This one that's indescribable beyond all of our thoughts or words or what are we? We're pieces of dust on a little piece of earth. An orb out here. I don't even know how God could locate it in the universe. &gt;&gt; But this was his womb for life. It was a profusion of seeds. That's where he'd focus the full focus of his word. Let there be. &gt;&gt; And there was. Let there be light. Let there be waters. Let the waters bring forth. Let the earth bring forth. Let the dry land appear. Maybe it took trillions of years. I don't know. I couldn't care less. But it happened. &gt;&gt; And here we come. Individuals that have something within us that cry out &gt;&gt; for this eternal being. &gt;&gt; And we're here because God &gt;&gt; that you call your God wanted to make himself known and reveal himself. &gt;&gt; And listen how perfect this is. And he couldn't do it as the great Jehovah. God who covered all space, &gt;&gt; time, and eternity. He could not. He's too great to ever be revealed to people because it would be too mysterious. I'm going to close in a moment. How could he, that great being that never did begin? &gt;&gt; You don't understand that. I don't understand that. that after you went out beyond the cycle of hundreds and billions and trillions. You might say, "Well, I've heard it read before." Well, I'm reading it to you again. &gt;&gt; You know, all your mathematics and your calculus and all of your brother Jean is studying artificial intelligence. That's way up here someplace. artificial intelligence at SFU. I tell you what, this isn't artificial intelligence. This is the original intelligence. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And after you went out, trillions and trillions of years of light space. And here you have a man with a a man that vessel with a seventh grade education using a scientific term. You hear it all the time. years of light space. &gt;&gt; Think of it. &gt;&gt; When I first read it, I said, "That's a scientific terminology." &gt;&gt; Where'd he get that? &gt;&gt; Praise God. &gt;&gt; Not in Kentucky. &gt;&gt; From a divine source. &gt;&gt; Tell them who I am. Now he's asking a a cultured and educated way up here that I made education of God. Now they're asking you explain that. &gt;&gt; And he said he couldn't. &gt;&gt; It couldn't be explained. &gt;&gt; But he gives the answer. Amen. &gt;&gt; And after you went beyond the cycle of hundreds of billions and trillions and trillions of years of light space and on out into the infinite into the eternity &gt;&gt; and a great creature that was all of that and still is &gt;&gt; he says but what he wanted to do &gt;&gt; listen now you'll never grasp this without someone that a prophet messenger that could actually reach into the mind of God. Don't tell me how. Don't ask me how. I do not know. &gt;&gt; I cannot even I can't even know. My wife is sitting back there. Her dad is had a massive heart attack. Hung between life and death for five weeks in an oxygen tent. We had William Brandham up to Port El Bernie and then Victoria and then he's just leaving and I'm outside his motel and his wife and children are in the motel and it's the last it was just deep dusk and I was saying brother Brandon may you have a nice journey and God be with you and something we're just having our little final things. My wife had wanted to talk to him and ask him about her daddy. Had not been a professed Christian as such, but was a very, very good man. They want him to be mayor of the city they lived in. So that was his stature in amongst the people, but he didn't know Jesus Christ as a savior. And there he's laying hanging between life and death. And while we're having these words, Brother Bram just goes like this to my wife. By the way, Sister Biscll, your father will be all right. &gt;&gt; Say, "Well, that was just a nice word." He didn't know anything about it. &gt;&gt; Hadn't got to talk to him yet. What does all right mean? All right means that you're born again. &gt;&gt; You can't be all right and not be born again. &gt;&gt; And he received Jesus Christ after this. [Music] He said he couldn't do it. He said, but what he wanted to do, what he wanted to do, please let this sink very deep. He loved fatherhood. &gt;&gt; Here's this great indescribable being full of attributes. &gt;&gt; He's God. Yeah, &gt;&gt; he created all of these things, &gt;&gt; millions of species on the earth. He created all of this. But that wasn't what is. He didn't say, "Well, look at the dinosaurs. Look at these giant creatures. Look at all the sea and everything that's in." That wasn't it. He loved fatherhood. &gt;&gt; I want to have a family. &gt;&gt; He craved to have fellowship. &gt;&gt; Amen. Yes. &gt;&gt; Do you hear me? &gt;&gt; This God picks us drags &gt;&gt; of the earth. I'm going to make you worthy. &gt;&gt; I'm going to come myself. I'm going to love you &gt;&gt; into my kingdom. &gt;&gt; And you will love me. &gt;&gt; You because you see what I did for you &gt;&gt; and there's no sin. Who can separate us from the love of God? &gt;&gt; Nothing. &gt;&gt; No height, no depth, no trouble, &gt;&gt; no money problems, no economic problems, nothing can separate us from the love of God. &gt;&gt; If something could separate us, who is God? &gt;&gt; Not this God. &gt;&gt; And he loves fatherhood. And he said, "For he was a father." &gt;&gt; And I I'd like you if you could repeat it. The only way &gt;&gt; say the only way &gt;&gt; that he could express it was to become a son of man. &gt;&gt; It's the only way. There's no other way. &gt;&gt; And thus when he came in a body of earth, taken out of the earth that God himself had cursed, he saw him coming up out of the water, having heard his Elijah prophet and being baptized of him. When he comes up out of the water, no wonder a voice spoke out of the heavens. This is my beloved son. &gt;&gt; God couldn't hold it back anymore. He loved fatherhood. I've got a son. I've got a son &gt;&gt; and this son is going to pay the penalty. &gt;&gt; He's going to obedient be obedient to every word of God. &gt;&gt; And that is why even when his friends and his disciples couldn't understand it and said, "You'll never go to death. &gt;&gt; I'll go with you." Peter said, &gt;&gt; Jesus said, "Get behind me, Satan. You don't perceive. You don't understand the things. He never cursed him. He never damned him. He didn't. And Peter didn't betray him. He denied him, but he didn't betray him. Judas betrayed him. Right at this great transition time, &gt;&gt; and I haven't got time to get into it, &gt;&gt; but all of this rubbish and stuff that goes around and says, "Well, he said this and he said that." And God knows what he said. And God, who knows what he said, stood right with him on the platform, night after night to the very end. [Music] &gt;&gt; Pentecost, old, he went off at the end. Oh, did he? He spent the last 30 days of his life, almost every service, speaking for them. &gt;&gt; So I cast right back them. Oh, you had someone who went off teaching and preaching to you? No. Don't be hypocritical now. You loved that. What you call a gift wasn't a gift. It was a prophetic ministry. &gt;&gt; And they've never had it since &gt;&gt; and the world will never see it again. &gt;&gt; He said the very next thing is the resurrection and the rapture. And that's why this message came. That's why this Lord Jesus revealed himself. I am he that was. I am he that is. And I am he that will be. There's no other son that can say I'm the first and I'm the last. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; I'm the beginning and I'm the end. &gt;&gt; Glory to God. &gt;&gt; That's this son of God. &gt;&gt; That's this son of man. &gt;&gt; This son of God. And he will show himself to the Jews as son of David. &gt;&gt; I say hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And I'm closing with this simple phrase. God has made you Cloverdale. By the way, I don't care what the name is. I don't care what term, what name you give yourself as a group. You either have this revelation or don't have it. &gt;&gt; And those that God has revealed himself to, &gt;&gt; only he can give it. &gt;&gt; He that reveals himself has made you a witness and a guardian &gt;&gt; of the revelation &gt;&gt; of the son of man. Amen. &gt;&gt; You that are having the meetings at SFU, &gt;&gt; that's what you're testifying. &gt;&gt; You that have had an experience with God, &gt;&gt; perhaps you that have been to camp, you that have been baptized in this tank, that's what this is all about. &gt;&gt; That's what this is all about. &gt;&gt; We're not here to hanker or quibble about is it this way, is it that way? God has said which way it is, &gt;&gt; and God is honoring what he honors. I understand that two more want to be baptized this evening. &gt;&gt; Oh my my &gt;&gt; I wonder brother Nathan if you could come please. I had written down my hope is in the Lord &gt;&gt; and from this time on &gt;&gt; I wonder if you can sing it with me in a new way in a living way. This is my this isn't only my hope. This is my faith. I'm here at this end. &gt;&gt; God knew I would live in this age, in this generation, this time. &gt;&gt; We're not here to preach politics, &gt;&gt; but I I come from the Ukraine or my greatgrandparents came from the Ukraine and my grandpa came from the Ukraine. Came from where the hetic Jews sect that have the curls. There was a it's a Horidena and it's a small village but I understand it became very well known that Jews have about 500 years of history in the Ukraine. Russia has just amassed a 100,000 troops and they talk about Crimea. There is no trouble in Crimea. And I'm not here to discuss politics. I'm simply to say you and I don't know. We could be in a we could be in a war tomorrow morning. &gt;&gt; We don't know how it's going to happen. &gt;&gt; Don't start calling then. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; Say, "I give my life now. &gt;&gt; I'm giving myself now." You may be a believer. You may be a Christian, but you need to take a whole new grasp of it. Say, "I didn't realize some of these things. God, do what you would with me. I'm the clay. You're the potter. Do what you would like to do. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Let's not let's not just treat it as another Sunday &gt;&gt; in the name of Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; Brother Vernon Manahan uh from the Philippines is just ending his trip. He'd be arriving in Seattle tomorrow night, Monday night, and then they're just having a little bit of a gathering. Lord willing, I would like to go down. Uh, I'd like you to remember him and the other brethren, Brother Nester, Brother Delmundo, and there's other pastors. I'm happy for those people. I don't know, maybe you weren't here when he said it, but I called as soon as I heard about the super typhoon and the terrible thing. I didn't know if believers had lost their homes or lost lives or whatever more. I called I I sent an email immediately to Pastor Nester and I said, "Tomorrow morning when our office opens, we will send immediately $10,000." I didn't know whether we had it or what, but I knew that it would happen. And so we sent that and they said we were some of the first to respond. Three pastors took their position to take responsibility for the area. They divided the whole devastated area into three areas. I'm just telling this very quickly to you to let you know that I said when when we give on behalf of the people. I said we want to have a high high degree of accountability. Not just that you receive the funds and not just that you give the funds to needy people, but that you see that those funds do for those people what they need. If they need a house that it's built, if they need income and especially food and water and clothing right now, they lost everything. Lost absolutely everything. And in the short time since that typhoon, these three brothers and the giving of believers all over the country have built over 200 homes. These are small, they're simple. They're just maybe two rooms, but at least they're not under a piece of tin. &gt;&gt; And they're not on the ground with thousands of snakes, &gt;&gt; which a lot of them were troubled with because the snakes flood waters came. And with the typhoon, the water came and swept it all in. Dead bodies were still when Brother Vernon was here a few days ago, said there's still people. They haven't uncovered everyone. We're sitting here. you're going to go to a nice room and maybe a nice home or go for something to eat. But brother Vernon, don't forget he's going back to the situation. They built six churches and over 200 homes. And they build a they can build a home there for, you know, maybe 1,500, a couple thousand dollars or less. And the and the believers gave and unbelievers and even officials said, "What kind of organization do you have?" said, 'We don't have any. &gt;&gt; We don't have an organization. Well, how did you get I mean, we've got all of the, you know, the jurisdiction of the various government agencies and large agencies and everything else said, "No, this came right away." People sent right away and they got building materials and they started to build. I just say, well, I thank God for that and thank the people for that. Thank everyone for their, you know, that's that's one of the material things. But there's a day coming &gt;&gt; when there'll be no more typhoons &gt;&gt; and there'll be no more death. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And there'll be no more sorrow. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And there'll be no more tears. &gt;&gt; You might have had tears this last week. I tell you, in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ, through this beloved son, there will be no more tears. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. Amen. &gt;&gt; There'll be no more pain. &gt;&gt; Behold, he said, I make all things new. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah to his name. Why don't we stand? Say, my hope is in him. I trust that you were able to grasp, hang on to some of these things today. Will you do that? &gt;&gt; And tonight are having two more baptisms tonight. Brother Tom Ray will be ministering and uh we have another baby dedication this evening and we're happy about that. All right, let us just sing this song together in closing. [Music] My heart is in the Oh, my home is in the Lord forever. [Music] I stand in all within the presence of the Lord in the ways of all the aesthe [Music] [Applause] Jesus the living.

To meet the sinner in his brokenness, [Music] to offer healing and forgiveness [Applause] and those who trust in him will find their heart and your confession now in the Lord. Oh [Music] my go [Music] forever. Let's just sing that second verse again. I'm going to ask brother Kyle. Brother Kyle, would you be able to come and pray a prayer with this congregation? Find a willing sister for that child. God bless you. His tender mercies come with every rising sun. &gt;&gt; Yes. to be. [Music] Say yes to him now. [Music] [Applause] [Music] will find their hearts and my there is no one else forever. Amen. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Lord Jesus, I don't even know what to say, Lord. I'm just so thankful that it's about you, Lord Jesus. It's you, Lord, that's arrested our lives, Lord, that's come and grabbed a hold of our soul, Lord Jesus. The the bridegroom call came through the message, Lord Jesus. And how we're so thankful for that, Lord. We're thankful to be here, Lord, to be able to hear the word this morning. We want to thank you for that, Lord. May you bless Brother Ed. May you strengthen him, Lord Jesus, and just continue to move in our midst, Lord. It's not just about being in church, Lord. It's about you just moving and having your way upon different lives, different brothers and sisters, Lord Jesus. So, would you help us as we go for lunch, Lord? Be with us in our conversation. And Lord, would you help our minds and our spirits be refreshed so we can come again and hear the word this evening, Lord? Bless Tom as he prepares, Lord. And Father, I just I just pray you be with the children, Lord. how we love what you're doing amongst the young people, Lord. And there's we how we we're so happy to see with Dominic, Lord, and his second son, Lord. Bless them, we pray, Lord. Bless all the young kids, Lord. Protect them, Lord, from this wicked age, Lord Jesus. Oh, God. May your hand be upon them so strong, Lord. Be with the children, Lord. How we just so love them, Father. And be with the older ones, too, Lord. We don't want to leave anybody out. We just love you. Pray you have your way this day, Lord. We give it to you in Jesus name. Amen. [Music] Thank you, brother Kyle. And listen, there's one more important notice tonight. We're also going to have a a short video clip to that will give you the uh give you the instructions, not so much instruction, but show you how you can link up. And over the last few weeks, uh, the brothers of Brother Michael Ray, Brother Tom have been working very, very hard, uh, to get the testimonies of some of the people that you perhaps have met, maybe you haven't even met, uh, the students from SFU, uh, different families that have been deeply deeply affected within the congregation, the Florent family, &gt;&gt; uh, the Adamora family, how we thank God &gt;&gt; for the sovereign work of God. &gt;&gt; This young man right here, Jonathan Walder, over a year ago, August, God be to speak to him. I didn't know it. And he was sitting right here in the second seat and then on the first seat and and others gave testimony the same thing. I just thought saw the glory of God on it. I didn't know who he was cuz I hadn't seen him for about 4 years and God just laid his hand on him out in the world and brought them right in the kingdom of God. So we have the testimonies of these people. I haven't even heard them. I don't know know how that all happened. It was happening too fast. And how do you have like there's about 37 been baptized in the last 13 months. Now two more tonight to be 39. Do you realize that's the size of some little bodies of people? 39 people in in in a in 13 months. I just say this is of God. &gt;&gt; And furthermore, I'm also willing to say the wind can blow and pass and you may not see it for another 13 months. &gt;&gt; But I say to you that have experienced it, God gave it to you for one purpose, to be a true witness &gt;&gt; of the revelation that God made it to you. Brother Steven, God called you &gt;&gt; sovereignly &gt;&gt; and gave you such a clear revelation &gt;&gt; without any without any prompting. Harley, you just begin to see things. And many can say the same thing. I say, "God bless you as you're dismissed. And if you'd come a little bit early tonight, please come a little bit early. Maybe we'll start the song service a few minutes, maybe 10, 15 minutes early, so we have time for all of these things." All right. God bless you. Greet one another with a good handshake. Amen.
