[11:27] he's going to take, but we have one that
[11:29] was just brought up here from Brother
[11:31] Milco and uh, his wife Johanna.
[11:34] Um, sends her greetings. Would very very
[11:37] much like to thank the church for
[11:38] praying for her. She was operated on
[11:40] last Thursday, removed her left kidney.
[11:43] Next day she went for a short walk and
[11:45] she's feeling very good. She'll be
[11:47] coming home um in a few days for
[11:51] recovery and uh brother Milco's just
[11:54] praying that the Lord would continue to
[11:55] work on her soul. And uh if you want to
[11:58] visit, you're welcome, but please phone
[12:01] first. So, let's just pray for Johanna
[12:04] that God would just really deal with
[12:05] her. And if you've got a need that you
[12:08] uh
[12:09] have on your heart this morning, you're
[12:12] listening over the internet, you've got
[12:13] a need, you just lift it before the Lord
[12:15] as we go to prayer. Amen. Nathan,
[12:19] [Music]
[12:23] bow our heads.
[12:25] Dear gracious heavenly father, Lord,
[12:27] it's such an honor and a privilege to be
[12:28] able to come here this morning.
[12:31] Lord, we just come expecting to hear
[12:33] great things, to be changed in our
[12:35] lives, Lord. And we ask that you just be
[12:38] with our pastor as he comes and breaks
[12:40] spread a life to us, God. That you see

[12:56] here, Father. Each person has a request.

[13:01] just ask that you would speak to each
[13:02] heart, dear Father. And Lord, we're a
[13:05] needy people, God. We need you
[13:07] constantly, Father. We thank you for
[13:09] your goodness and your mercy to us, dear
[13:11] Lord. We ask now that you'd just be the
[13:13] remainder of the service. Be with our
[13:15] worship, Lord. That it be pleasing to
[13:16] you, dear God. We thank you for your
[13:19] goodness, Lord. Be with us now in the
[13:20] precious name of Jesus Christ. Amen.
[13:24] [Music]
[13:27] Amen. You may be seated.
[13:36] [Music]
[13:38] I want to welcome all those who are
[13:40] visiting with us. If you're here this
[13:41] morning, we just uh we're very happy to
[13:44] have you here with us. And a special
[13:46] welcome to have brother Ben and Sister
[13:48] Beth Dingwald down with us. Always happy
[13:50] to have them here. And uh Sister
[13:53] Patricia Briner has a song for us this
[13:55] morning as uh Sister Patricia comes.
[13:58] Let's sing together. I just want to
[14:00] please the Lord. I've had that song just
[14:02] uh keeps going over and over through my
[14:04] mind and that's all I want to do. Amen.
[14:06] Is it your desire as well? You sing it
[14:09] to him as a real confession as sister
[14:11] Patricia comes.
[14:14] &gt;&gt; I just want to please
[14:18] the Lord.
[14:22] Be in his will in every way.
[14:29] To be lost in his presence,
[14:34] found in his likeness.
[14:37] hear and say, "Well done."
[14:42] Oh,
[14:44] I just want to please
[14:48] the Lord,
[14:52] be in his will in every way.
[14:57] Want to be lost in his presence,
[15:03] found in his likeness.
[15:06] here and say, "Well done."
[15:09] Someday
[15:12] [Music]
[15:29] [Music]
[15:44] Lord, you are my shepherd.
[15:50] You're the keeper
[15:52] of my heart.
[15:57] You guide my steps when I can't find my
[16:05] way.
[16:11] And yet I know
[16:14] deep within for you to truly
[16:21] lead.
[16:23] I must live in such a way
[16:29] that when you call my name,
[16:37] your whisper
[16:39] is enough.
[16:43] When I'm close enough to hear.
[16:50] When my one desire
[16:55] is just to have you near
[17:01] me.
[17:02] You still the storms around me with
[17:09] tender
[17:11] words of holyness.
[17:16] I want to live so that your whisper
[17:22] is
[17:23] enough.
[17:37] Is it any
[17:39] wonder
[17:42] that it's hard to hear your voice
[17:48] when we're so consumed by the cares of
[17:54] this world.
[17:57] [Music]
[18:00] But in an age that competes with
[18:07] everything
[18:09] you say,
[18:11] Lord, please give me ears to hear
[18:18] above the noise it makes.
[18:23] Till your whisper is enough
[18:30] and I'm close enough to hear
[18:36] when my one desire
[18:41] is just to have you
[18:45] near me. You still the storms around me
[18:52] with tender words of holyess.
[19:00] I want to live so that your whisper
[19:06] is
[19:07] enough.
[19:09] [Music]
[19:13] I want to live so that your whisper
[19:20] is
[19:22] enough.
[19:26] [Music]
[19:45] Thanks, Sister Patricia. Is it your
[19:47] desire?
[19:48] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[19:49] &gt;&gt; Just to be able to hear a whisper from
[19:50] the Lord and to be sensitive enough to
[19:53] know what his will is. Amen.
[19:56] I know the master of the sea.
[20:00] Let's sing that as the choir is going to
[20:02] come just before brother Biscll comes to
[20:04] bring the word.
[20:10] I know the master of the way.
[20:15] [Music]
[20:18] I know the maker of the
[20:25] He can
[20:30] shine.
[20:33] I know.
[20:37] &gt;&gt; Oh, I know the Lord.
[20:46] &gt;&gt; Oh, I know.
[20:48] &gt;&gt; I know.
[20:55] where he can promise and make the sun
[20:59] shine again.
[21:03] I know the master of the way.
[21:10] &gt;&gt; And just before choir sings, I was
[21:13] thinking of this
[21:15] scripture this morning because uh
[21:17] knowing the song they're going to sing.
[21:19] It says, "But now, oh Lord, as Isaiah
[21:21] said, thou art our father. We are the
[21:24] clay and thou art and thou are potter
[21:28] and we all are the work of thy hand."
[21:30] Amen. We just want to be molded by him.
[21:32] Amen. And is that your prayer?
[21:52] Beautiful
[22:10] Lord,
[22:12] wonderful Savior.
[22:16] I know for sure
[22:19] all of my days are held in your hand,
[22:26] crafted into
[22:29] your perfect
[22:33] plan.
[22:36] You gently call me into your presence,
[22:43] guiding me by
[22:46] your Holy Spirit.
[22:49] Teach me, dear Lord,
[22:52] to live all of my life
[22:56] through
[22:58] your

[24:18] guiding me by
[24:21] your holy spirit.
[24:24] Teach me, dear Lord,
[24:26] to live all of my life.

[27:51] &gt;&gt; Let's all stand together.
[27:54] [Music]
[27:57] Take me.
[28:03] You
[28:06] feel me?

[28:29] I give my life

[28:38] [Music]
[28:41] &gt;&gt; We're ready to give oursel
[28:44] &gt;&gt; unreservedly.
[28:46] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[28:47] Hallelujah.
[28:50] The choir be excused now. Thank you. God
[28:52] bless you.
[28:59] You can turn in your Bibles if you would
[29:01] please to uh Genesis the 49th chapter
[29:06] just while the choir is finding their
[29:08] seats.
[29:10] We'd like to say how happy we are that
[29:12] you are all here.
[29:15] We're really ha happy to have our
[29:17] brother Dioa with us again after
[29:21] uh long absence.
[29:24] &gt;&gt; We were having him at least I think once
[29:26] a year and now it's been two years. So
[29:30] uh our brother Dioa will be speaking to
[29:32] us tonight. Amen. And we're
[29:37] I I I just one service really isn't
[29:40] enough for me to hear what God is doing.
[29:43] And you just feel the heartbeat of of
[29:45] what God is doing in the Congo. It's
[29:48] really remarkable, friends. We we don't
[29:50] want to think about the great things God
[29:52] did yesterday and the great things God
[29:54] is going to do tomorrow. We want to be
[29:56] in tune with what God is doing right
[29:58] now. And I I I want to try to feel, you
[30:00] know, what the heart of God is. When
[30:04] when you see that he's just brought
[30:06] masses of people within the Congo, it
[30:08] didn't happen by accident. It happened
[30:11] because people had a burden and had an
[30:13] effort. And I see our brother Dioa. He's
[30:17] not a large man in stature, but he has a
[30:21] he has a heart that somehow God has been
[30:25] pleased to honor and has reached out to
[30:28] multitudes and not without a great deal
[30:31] of difficulty. Satan always uses every
[30:34] means to hinder. But I can say that uh
[30:39] much of what I will have to say this
[30:41] morning and what Jacob said about
[30:44] Joseph, his son, certainly is applicable
[30:47] to the bride of Jesus Christ and to men
[30:50] such as brother Dioa. He's been fruitful
[30:53] in spite of the arrows.
[30:56] &gt;&gt; Fruitful in spite of the difficulties
[31:00] and that's the way we are to be that God
[31:03] has given that to us. Uh before we read
[31:07] uh I'm going to take some prayer
[31:09] requests that have come in and uh our
[31:13] brother Ed Nicaroo
[31:15] has uh needs prayer for his hip.
[31:19] Uh and so we want to pray for brother
[31:21] Ed. Uh Sister Clara Wman said that her
[31:25] mom is requesting prayer. Isn't that
[31:29] nice? from the colony is requesting
[31:32] prayer for her brother Chris, that is
[31:36] Sister Wman's brother Chris who has had
[31:39] two accidents in one week and we believe
[31:42] that God is trying to get his attention.
[31:44] We pray for a quick recovery.
[31:46] Brother Jeff Mitchell injured his back
[31:49] yesterday. Please pray that he'll
[31:51] recover quickly. We had a prayer request
[31:54] phoned in from our sister Glenda
[31:58] uh
[32:03] Lancov
[32:05] and uh she did not phone. I believe her
[32:08] husband phoned
[32:10] and she had pieces of bone in her neck
[32:14] have been breaking off and she is in
[32:17] excruciating pain at this time. It's
[32:19] pressing on several nerves
[32:22] and even giving her morphine is not
[32:24] doing anything to control it. And she's
[32:28] meeting with a surgeon on the 15th. So
[32:31] that's this week. They desired that the
[32:33] Lord would touch her. I just got off the
[32:36] phone also with brother Glenn Grunert.
[32:40] And yesterday afternoon I felt to call
[32:43] Sister Shauna and spoke to her at the
[32:45] hospital regarding her mom, Sister Marge
[32:47] Miller.
[32:49] And it came to me earlier in the day,
[32:53] just before I called Sister Shauna, that
[32:55] Sister Marge is holding on till her sons
[33:00] are all there.
[33:02] And uh Brad, her youngest son, is on the
[33:05] on the island, I believe.
[33:08] And I said to Sister Sean, I said, "She
[33:10] is refusing to go. She God has given her
[33:14] such a strong will. She's just such a
[33:16] strong spirited woman. She has held on
[33:20] so steadfastly for those sons. I said
[33:23] she's waiting till they're there. And
[33:25] they just uh they were all together last
[33:29] night and spent the night with her. And
[33:32] it it seems that this morning that her
[33:34] breathing had just became very very
[33:36] weak. And but she was able to speak with
[33:39] the sons and express her love for them.
[33:43] and even in that weakened condition
[33:45] raise her arms out and take them. And I
[33:48] tell you
[33:49] uh uh we've had a wonderful soldier
[33:52] amongst us.
[33:54] &gt;&gt; And uh this kind of faith and if if it
[33:57] would glorify God, I say before this
[34:00] congregation and all who listen, I would
[34:03] not be shocked in I would not be shocked
[34:06] one iota to see her walk through the
[34:08] doors tonight. Amen.
[34:10] &gt;&gt; Our God, as Ge as Martha said to Jesus
[34:15] when her h when her brother was still
[34:17] dead in the tomb said, "Even now,
[34:20] &gt;&gt; whatsoever you will ask, it'll be done."
[34:23] We know that. And so, we just know that
[34:26] our Lord Jesus who's amongst us, we want
[34:28] him to make his will perfectly known.
[34:31] And we want to remember Brother Murphy
[34:33] as well. I know that he's on a tiring
[34:36] schedule in China. So, if you'll just
[34:39] bow and we're going to praise before we
[34:41] break open the word. Our dear heavenly
[34:44] father, there's one thing that we can
[34:46] say and I believe that would be in
[34:48] complete unison within the whole
[34:50] congregation. We love you our God. We
[34:54] love you from the depths of our heart.
[34:56] We love your ways and how you call
[34:59] people. And as we sung in the chorus,
[35:02] how you mold us. You are the potter and
[35:05] we love how you how you mold us, Lord.
[35:08] How you deal with us. It's not always
[35:10] the way we intend it to be. It's not
[35:13] always what we thought it would be. And
[35:15] no one can predict how you will work
[35:17] with your people, Lord. Sometimes it
[35:19] looks like it's going backwards when
[35:21] it's going ahead. Oh God, sometimes it
[35:24] looks like it's just a all these
[35:26] reversals, but it's not a reversal.
[35:28] There is no reversal. There is no
[35:30] defeat. There is nothing negative with
[35:32] you. Your plan is moving on. Your church
[35:36] is moving on. The Holy Ghost is moving
[35:38] on. And your people, Lord, are in
[35:41] they're in harmony and in tune with your
[35:43] program. And this morning, Lord, if
[35:46] there would be any here or under the
[35:48] sound of my voice that would be out of
[35:50] touch with you, may they be brought into
[35:52] harmony. May evil, every evil spirit, oh
[35:55] God, be defeated and sent far, oh God,
[35:59] from the doors of this place, from the
[36:01] hearts of the people. We pray, Father,
[36:03] for our sister Marge Miller, that even
[36:06] now, oh God, we know you could raise her
[36:08] out of that bed and bring her, Lord
[36:11] Jesus, to a healthy life and give her
[36:14] some years, Lord, of life if this would
[36:17] be a pleasing thing to you. But we say,
[36:20] "Oh God, not our will, not our thoughts,
[36:24] not our human instinct, but may your
[36:27] name be glorified." We pray. I pray,
[36:30] Father, that her prayers concerning her
[36:33] children and her sons. I pray, Father,
[36:35] that you'll break down every wall, every
[36:38] barrier that hinders them and bring and
[36:41] bend their knees to repentance in the
[36:44] name of Jesus Christ. Holy Spirit, take
[36:47] control. I pray of their minds and of
[36:49] their lives. Uh bring them no peace.
[36:52] Lord, let them not have rest at night.
[36:54] Oh God, let not prosperity come their
[36:57] way until you have dealt with them. Oh
[37:00] God, I pray you will deal with them in a
[37:02] mighty way. Bless sister Shauna and
[37:04] Sister Pat. Lord, strengthen the family.
[37:07] I pray especially sister Shauna and
[37:10] Sister Pat have spent so many days. I
[37:12] pray, oh God, you'll be their companion
[37:14] and be their source of virtue at this
[37:17] time. Oh Lord, we know that you hear us.
[37:20] Our brother Ed Nicaroo is suffering. Oh
[37:22] God, brother Jeff Mitchell with an
[37:24] injury in his back. Oh father and our
[37:27] sister Glenda Lancov. Oh God,
[37:31] we we have the authority to resist these
[37:34] evil things, Lord, and remove this curse
[37:37] from off of them, oh God, that they
[37:40] might have their uh peace and might have
[37:43] their uh their full health restored back
[37:46] to them and all other needs, oh God,
[37:48] wherever they may be represented at this
[37:50] time. And Lord, we're in need. I'm in
[37:53] need. We're standing with a in a few
[37:55] moments with your word in our hands, but
[37:59] only you, the author, can open it. Make
[38:02] it known to us. I pray let be said what
[38:06] you would have said.
[38:09] Bless our brother Dioa amongst us,
[38:11] Father, his congregation at home in
[38:14] Kenshasa. I pray, oh God, you'll bless,
[38:17] oh father, his work, and that it is not
[38:20] his work but your work. prosper the work
[38:23] I pray even more and may the message be
[38:26] sent out with a mighty mighty voice very
[38:29] quickly I pray dear Lord Jesus we say
[38:33] your will be done we want to bless you
[38:36] now worship you in hearing your word in
[38:39] Jesus Christ's name amen
[38:42] &gt;&gt; amen bless you I'm going to read
[38:47] out of Genesis the 49th chapter
[38:51] and we'll look at verses 1 and two.
[38:55] I'm actually going to be speaking, it
[38:57] may not sound like it
[39:01] harmonizes, but I spoke on Wednesday
[39:04] night, fight the good fight of faith.
[39:06] Fight the good fight of faith. And
[39:08] that's what we're going to be continuing
[39:10] on with part two. We were taking
[39:13] Joseph's life because Joseph was a
[39:16] perfect type of Jesus Christ.
[39:20] We do not have much of the early life of
[39:24] Jesus recorded but we have considerable
[39:27] of the life of Joseph and he was a
[39:29] perfect type. Now it goes further than
[39:33] that that Christ that's in us should be
[39:36] expressed with these attributes.
[39:39] It says in verse one of Genesis 49, "And
[39:42] Jacob called unto his sons
[39:46] and said,"Gather yourselves together
[39:48] that I may tell you that which shall
[39:51] befall you in the last days.
[39:54] Gather yourselves together and hear, ye
[39:58] sons of Jacob, and hearken unto Israel
[40:02] your father." And he begins then a third
[40:04] verse with Reuben, his firstborn. And I
[40:07] want to go then to the 22nd where he
[40:11] speaks of Joseph. 22nd verse. Joseph is
[40:15] a fruitful bow, even a fruitful bow by a
[40:18] well whose branches run over the wall.
[40:22] The archers have sorely grieved him and
[40:26] shot at him and hated him. But his bow
[40:31] rem abode in strength and the arms of
[40:35] his hands were made strong by the hands
[40:38] of the mighty God of Jacob. From fence
[40:41] is the shepherd the stone of Israel.
[40:45] Amen.
[40:47] &gt;&gt; And the scripture tells us in 1 Timothy
[40:51] 6 and12 Paul saying fight the good fight
[40:54] of faith. lay hold on eternal life where
[40:58] unto thou art also called and hast
[41:02] professed a good profession before many
[41:05] witnesses. Amen. You may have your
[41:08] seats.
[41:19] We just discovered, I will review a wee
[41:22] bit of Wednesday, but very little.
[41:26] We discovered that this is a good fight.
[41:30] There are some fights that are good.
[41:32] Most are not good, but there are some
[41:33] that are good.
[41:35] This is an excellent fight.
[41:38] It's a useful fight. It's an admirable
[41:41] fight
[41:43] and it's necessary.
[41:46] Timothy saying, "I have fought a good
[41:48] fight. I have finished my course and
[41:51] I've kept the faith."
[41:53] This is a this is a good striving
[41:57] because to fight is to strive.
[41:59] It is not only to strive, but it it
[42:02] could be to labor fervently
[42:07] to enter into a contest. I'm prepared
[42:10] and willing to enter into this contest.
[42:13] I'm prepared to struggle. And that's not
[42:17] what we really, you know, physically in
[42:20] our flesh. We don't really want to
[42:22] struggle or exert ourselves. But this is
[42:26] a this is a worthy cause, friends, that
[42:30] we have today. It's a worthy cause. It's
[42:33] worthy of uh exercising ourselves and
[42:38] and spending our energy, mental energy,
[42:43] our focus, our concentration,
[42:45] whatever it is we do in life or even our
[42:49] physical work, we expend a lot of
[42:51] energy. But if we realize that the real
[42:54] goal of all of this expenditure of my
[42:57] time and my energy and my resources, the
[43:00] goal, my goal beyond that is spiritual
[43:05] &gt;&gt; and that's what's important. So we
[43:07] strive fervently because it's a very
[43:10] worthy struggle that we're in. In first
[43:13] Peter, we read 1 Peter 5:8, "Be sober.
[43:19] Be vigilant
[43:21] because your adversary," See, this is
[43:23] why we have a we're striving. This is
[43:26] this is what the struggle is all about.
[43:28] There isn't one person under the sound
[43:31] of my voice that does not have an
[43:34] adversary.
[43:35] And and we ought to learn something
[43:37] about him because we all have the same
[43:40] adversary.
[43:41] He works different tactics, but he is
[43:44] the same adversary. He is the adversary,
[43:47] the devil. And your adversary, the
[43:50] devil, as a roaring line, walketh about
[43:55] seeking whom he may devour. That is his
[43:59] intent. So, we are in a good fight.
[44:02] We're in an admirable fight. We know who
[44:05] our enemy is, and we have been given the
[44:08] weapon to defeat him. The word is our
[44:11] weapon. The word. Not what I think the
[44:14] word is, but the word. That's why it is
[44:17] so uh essential to stay with it. Be
[44:21] sober. And sober is to be watching. It
[44:26] also is this word in the Greek is very
[44:28] interesting, but it's to be calm and
[44:32] collected. Just to be calm. Uh because
[44:36] your adversary, the devil, is a roaring
[44:38] lion walketh about. So, we want to be
[44:40] sober, to watch, to be calm and
[44:44] collected in spirit. We're not in some
[44:46] kind of a frenzy or some nervous type of
[44:50] of of warfare. We're to be calm and
[44:53] collected in our spirit to be temperate,
[44:56] to be dispassionate and circumspect.
[45:00] Brother Brandham said in in in Melkazedc
[45:03] the great prince he said if he said if
[45:07] we'll approach this subject today real
[45:10] sensibly then he goes on calmly and
[45:15] never be excited. Now it doesn't mean
[45:17] never be happy or never be enthusiastic
[45:20] but never be excited. That nervous
[45:23] excitement that almost agitation faith
[45:26] never gets excited.
[45:29] Hallelujah.
[45:31] &gt;&gt; Faith never rushes itself. Faith knows
[45:36] what it's talking about. And so the
[45:39] people, we are children of faith. We
[45:42] don't have to be in some kind of nervous
[45:44] agitation and wonderment and this way
[45:47] and that way and and cast about, you
[45:50] know, and unsettled and nervous. No. Be
[45:53] sober is to be watching, but you're calm
[45:58] and collected in your spirit.
[46:01] In faith, once delivered to the saints,
[46:03] he said, "Every person that's born of
[46:05] the spirit of God that knows the Holy
[46:08] Spirit's in you rests assure
[46:12] God knows his destination and walk
[46:16] calmly before him."
[46:18] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[46:21] &gt;&gt; Be sober. Then he goes on to be vigilant
[46:25] also starting off with its main emphasis
[46:28] to to watch.
[46:31] So if it's be sober, watch, be vigilant,
[46:34] watch. And then they go off into
[46:37] different directions. Be vigilant is to
[46:39] be awake also and give strict attention
[46:44] to be cautious. We're here this morning
[46:46] to be vigilant.
[46:48] &gt;&gt; But when we go out from here, we even
[46:50] need to be more vigilant, watching, be
[46:54] cautious,
[46:56] &gt;&gt; be active, and take heed lest through
[47:00] remission and indolence or indolences to
[47:03] be apathetic, to be lethargic, to be
[47:07] idle, to be lazy. lest we through this
[47:11] kind of a a a sluggishness, some
[47:14] destructive calamity suddenly overtakes
[47:17] us. We haven't got any uh reason with
[47:21] the message that we hold. We must not
[47:24] slack off at any point.
[47:26] &gt;&gt; This thing that God has done amongst you
[47:28] young people, I'll urge you one thing.
[47:30] This is some good solid teaching for
[47:32] you. Don't slack off. That's exactly the
[47:35] spirit that Satan wants that kind of
[47:38] attitude, that kind of atmosphere so he
[47:40] can work in that. Don't don't become
[47:42] sluggish. Don't become lazy with your
[47:45] spiritual life. And that's good for all
[47:47] of us.
[47:50] &gt;&gt; To be vigilant is to be roused from wake
[47:55] for your adversary, the devil. And now
[47:58] here's interesting. I'm just laying a
[48:00] foundation here. your adversary.
[48:03] Adversary is your opponent. You have an
[48:06] opponent that you're struggling with. An
[48:09] opponent may be one who's in a in a in a
[48:13] suit of law. They can come against you
[48:16] because it has a judicial reference, can
[48:20] be an enemy, but your opponent. and uh
[48:24] your adversary. The adversary is
[48:28] actually made up of of of a couple of
[48:30] words in the Greek. I'm laying all this
[48:32] in as a foundation
[48:34] because first it is anti. And we know
[48:38] what anti is. That's in opposition to
[48:42] anti is over or against opposite to.
[48:45] Your adversary is opposite to what you
[48:48] believe. Your adversary is against your
[48:52] witness.
[48:53] &gt;&gt; Your adversary is an opponent to what
[48:56] you want to live.
[48:58] &gt;&gt; You have that. That's just the first
[49:00] part of it. He's he's your opponent.
[49:03] He's your enemy and he's against it. May
[49:06] be expressed in different ways, but he's
[49:09] against what you believe and hold
[49:11] precious. What you hold precious, he
[49:14] wants to trample underfoot.
[49:16] &gt;&gt; That's your adversary. He's he he's anti
[49:20] or he's opposite to what you believe in.
[49:23] And then secondly, it comes from a
[49:26] second word. I won't bother going into
[49:28] it, but there's a there's a certain uh a
[49:32] judgment that it's an anti-judgment or
[49:35] an anti-position
[49:37] which makes it a decision. It's an
[49:40] anti-decision to your decision. You
[49:43] know, you have a decision and say, "I'm
[49:45] going to do this for God." And then all
[49:47] kinds of things come in that are
[49:50] opposing what you really feel you should
[49:53] be doing or feel what you should be
[49:56] saying. You You could be sitting in a
[49:58] church. You could be sitting in this
[50:00] meeting and perhaps God has been dealing
[50:02] with you and really deep down, you know,
[50:06] well, I'm just giving you an example
[50:08] now. I should I I I ought to really
[50:10] surrender that up or I ought to really
[50:12] do that or I ought to really go to that
[50:14] person or I ought to you know whatever
[50:16] you think whatever the Holy Spirit
[50:18] whatever the Holy Spirit is initiating
[50:22] our opponent is against it.
[50:25] &gt;&gt; He's anti. He's opposing it. And not
[50:28] only does he oppose it, but now it comes
[50:30] in with the second part of this
[50:32] adversarial work. And that is that he he
[50:35] he comes with a judicial he'll come with
[50:38] a decision. He'll come weighing the
[50:41] thing out like it would be held in a
[50:43] court of law and things are debated and
[50:45] weighed out. And then he'll come with
[50:47] with all the reasons why you should not
[50:50] do what God is telling you to do.
[50:54] &gt;&gt; There'll be another time. There'll be a
[50:56] more opportune time. This isn't just
[50:58] working right just now. He's got all
[51:01] kinds of reasons. What is he doing? He's
[51:04] actually instructing you
[51:07] in opposition to what the Holy Spirit is
[51:10] telling you to do.
[51:11] &gt;&gt; And that's what adversary is. I want to
[51:14] go into that quite deeply. It's a
[51:17] judicial decision
[51:20] es especially of condemnation. It's an
[51:23] execution of a sentence. Uh it it it is
[51:28] it is to show or he gives reason to give
[51:32] evidence or proof of a thing and to show
[51:35] by words or to teach. I want to go over
[51:38] that slowly. An adversary,
[51:42] his whole intent, his whole purpose is
[51:45] to be and you have this adversary. God's
[51:49] word said so. You have this adversary,
[51:51] your adversary,
[51:53] the devil. So now what's he going to do?
[51:56] He's going to be in opposition.
[51:58] &gt;&gt; He's not merely going to be in
[51:59] opposition. He's going to give you
[52:01] reason why he's right.
[52:05] &gt;&gt; He's going to weigh out, well, yeah, you
[52:07] know, you feel to do this and you know,
[52:10] yeah, maybe that's the Holy Spirit is
[52:12] dealing you, but there's this reason and
[52:15] there's that reason. or there's the
[52:17] family or there's the job or there's
[52:20] this or there's something else and I
[52:22] have all these other reasons and he's
[52:25] actually working you into he's working
[52:28] you he's teaching you in another
[52:31] direction
[52:34] &gt;&gt; oh yes I know God's word says this
[52:36] regarding baptism how many people how
[52:39] many trinitarians for example how many
[52:42] people have been baptized in the titles
[52:44] have sat under the sound of the gospel
[52:46] and heard clearly from the word of God
[52:49] that that baptism clearly is in the name
[52:52] of the Lord Jesus Christ. And there
[52:54] wasn't one person between the covers of
[52:56] the book that I ever been baptized any
[52:59] other way. And you cannot tell me that
[53:01] the Holy Spirit does not witness in
[53:03] their heart that that is the truth.
[53:07] &gt;&gt; But the opponent, the adversary comes in
[53:10] immediately and begins to reason. And
[53:13] really what he's doing, he's teach he's
[53:16] teaching them. And that's really what
[53:18] this finally comes down to is that he's
[53:21] teaching them in opposition to what the
[53:24] word is.
[53:28] &gt;&gt; It's to show or to give evidence. That's
[53:30] what happens in a court case. An
[53:32] adversary or the opponent, you have the
[53:35] plaintiff and the defendant, and each
[53:37] are giving their case. Each are stating
[53:39] their case before a judge. Well, I can
[53:42] tell you that the judge has already
[53:44] declared his truth right here.
[53:47] &gt;&gt; But he wants to be a teacher to show by
[53:50] words or to teach.
[53:54] Now,
[53:56] in Exodus 4:12, I'm just going to read a
[53:58] verse. He said, "Now therefore, go," God
[54:00] speaking to Moses, "go, and I will be
[54:04] with thy mouth and teach thee. I am
[54:08] going to teach you what you shall say.
[54:13] And then in Exodus 4:15, it goes on,
[54:16] "And then thou shalt speak unto him
[54:20] uh and and and put words in his mouth."
[54:23] I believe this was now to Aaron. And I
[54:26] will be with thy mouth and be with his
[54:29] mouth and will teach you what you shall
[54:32] do. I am going to teach you. I'm going
[54:36] to be your teacher. I'm going to be your
[54:39] instructor. Did he have Did he have an
[54:42] adversary? Did he ever? He had many
[54:45] adversaries from within and from
[54:48] without. But God's word still could ne
[54:52] would always prevail. There's no way for
[54:55] God's word and God's program to fail.
[54:59] &gt;&gt; I'm going to teach you now. teach in the
[55:02] Hebrew has a very very interesting and
[55:05] very wonderful in fact I'm having a
[55:07] wonderful experience right now because I
[55:09] just chose these last scriptures for a
[55:11] text that I was going to read today. I
[55:14] had some other scriptures but I decided
[55:15] to read out of Genesis 49 and how the
[55:19] scripture says that uh that the archers
[55:22] have sorely grieved him. This was Joseph
[55:25] but his bow abode in strength. The word
[55:30] teach in the Hebrew
[55:33] is a a simple word. It's it's yah. Yah,
[55:37] which is to shoot
[55:40] to shoot arrows.
[55:43] God says, now you have to think about
[55:44] that for a moment. God says, "I'm going
[55:47] to teach you literally, I'm going to
[55:50] shoot this like an arrow into your
[55:53] heart.
[55:54] &gt;&gt; I'm going to I'm going to penetrate.
[55:58] There's nothing going to stop the arrow
[56:00] of God. I'm going to pull my bow back
[56:04] and I'm going to teach you. Yah. I'm
[56:07] going to penetrate into the very deepest
[56:10] resource regardless of what I'm going to
[56:13] go beyond your reasoning. I'm going to
[56:15] go beyond your circumstance.
[56:18] My word is going to anchor in your heart
[56:22] and you will not be able to escape it
[56:24] because it'll be revealed to you.
[56:27] Hallelujah.
[56:29] &gt;&gt; Can you not be thankful this morning?
[56:30] Say, "Praise God."
[56:32] &gt;&gt; God's word has been anchored in my
[56:34] heart. Circumstances have tried to tear
[56:37] it out. Friends tried to tear it out. My
[56:40] associates tried to tear it out. My
[56:42] family tried to tear it out. But nobody
[56:45] could remove it out from me.
[56:47] &gt;&gt; God had anchored it in my heart.
[56:51] Amen.
[56:53] &gt;&gt; I will teach you
[56:57] to show
[57:00] to direct and teach and instruct.
[57:04] Moses is now in the 24th chapter it says
[57:09] 12th verse. And the Lord said unto
[57:10] Moses, "Come to me into the mountain and
[57:16] be there, and I will give thee tables of
[57:19] stone and a law and commandments which I
[57:22] have which I have written
[57:25] that thou mayest teach them." Now, it
[57:30] isn't only God going to teach Moses, but
[57:32] now Moses going to teach the people.
[57:35] &gt;&gt; And the method remains the same.
[57:37] &gt;&gt; It's still God's arrow.
[57:39] Hallelujah. It's God's bowl.
[57:42] &gt;&gt; I'm going to I'm going to be the one
[57:44] that's going to energize this truth
[57:47] &gt;&gt; and it's going to go through you now as
[57:48] a vessel, but it's going to go into the
[57:51] hearts of the people.
[57:53] The same pillar of fire, the same pillar
[57:57] of fire that spoke that God used to
[58:00] speak through to Moses in the prophets
[58:04] in the message principles of divine
[58:06] healing. He said, "It's been a long
[58:08] time, my dear friends, here in
[58:11] Jefferson, Jeffersonville, probably no
[58:13] doubt at all, but a few years ago, that
[58:17] some of the people thought I'd mentally
[58:19] slipped when I begin to speak of speak
[58:22] of God being the same yesterday, today,
[58:24] and forever." Things that people said
[58:27] people thought that he began to mentally
[58:29] slip. He says, "In my heart." This is
[58:33] when he in his early ministry. But he
[58:35] said, "But in my heart there was
[58:37] something that anchored there that I
[58:40] could not get away from."
[58:47] &gt;&gt; God said to Moses, "I am going to teach
[58:51] you
[58:52] &gt;&gt; and then you will teach the people."
[58:56] Here in the very early years,
[58:59] Dr. Davis, the man who ordained the
[59:02] prophet, said, "You need to get next to
[59:04] yourself, Billy.
[59:07] You gone off the deep end
[59:09] getting into all of these all angels
[59:12] speaking to you and all of these
[59:14] things." But he said, "He was anchored
[59:17] there forever.
[59:19] &gt;&gt; I couldn't get away from it." Why?
[59:21] Because God had taught it.
[59:24] &gt;&gt; That that was the supernatural. It'd be
[59:26] like saying to Joseph, "Joseph,"
[59:31] his brothers tried to tell him, "All
[59:33] your dreams, your dreams about the our
[59:37] sheavs,
[59:39] bowing down to yours, you young
[59:42] strippling
[59:43] daddy's little favorite boy with your
[59:46] little colored coat. Get out of here."
[59:51] That's what he heard. And the Bible says
[59:54] they couldn't speak peaceibly to him.
[59:56] That was every day. Couldn't speak
[59:58] peaceibly. He had that every day that
[1:00:01] just nattering, that feeling, that
[1:00:03] attitude. All the older brothers and not
[1:00:05] only not only just didn't like him,
[1:00:07] hated him.
[1:00:09] &gt;&gt; Hated him.
[1:00:11] &gt;&gt; But he couldn't get rid of it. He
[1:00:13] couldn't get rid of it. Why' they say?
[1:00:15] Because he couldn't help it. It was in
[1:00:17] him. That was a spiritual part. That
[1:00:20] spiritual part that God does is divine.
[1:00:23] You can have all the harassment. You can
[1:00:26] have all the opposition. You can have
[1:00:28] all the criticism. You can have whatever
[1:00:30] you want. But you can never move it
[1:00:32] because that spiritual part come is
[1:00:34] divine. It come from God. And what come
[1:00:36] from God happens to be, my friends,
[1:00:39] eternal.
[1:00:40] &gt;&gt; Eternal.
[1:00:42] &gt;&gt; I've had people try to tell me all kinds
[1:00:44] of things. They might as well talk to a
[1:00:45] telephone pole.
[1:00:47] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:00:48] &gt;&gt; Amen. It's not me that's stubborn.
[1:00:51] &gt;&gt; It's not that. It has nothing to do with
[1:00:53] the human will. It has to do, can you
[1:00:55] imagine that it's still Satan that
[1:00:57] raises himself up to use his instrument
[1:01:00] to try to attack the very divine thing
[1:01:03] that God has done in an individual life.
[1:01:06] &gt;&gt; And you can always tell God God's things
[1:01:10] because they're clean,
[1:01:12] &gt;&gt; they're holy,
[1:01:13] &gt;&gt; they're righteous. It's in harmony with
[1:01:15] the word of God. You know that it's
[1:01:17] spiritual. Amen.
[1:01:20] &gt;&gt; So now to teach,
[1:01:24] he said something had anchored there
[1:01:26] that I could not get away from
[1:01:29] and I know that someday God would give
[1:01:32] me the privilege to prove that it was
[1:01:35] right because it was the scripture.
[1:01:37] Amen.
[1:01:39] &gt;&gt; In the unpardonable sin, he said, "I've
[1:01:42] seen 23 years now of leading by the Holy
[1:01:46] Spirit to yield myself to him and not
[1:01:49] pay any attention to what nothing says."
[1:01:53] Just imagine people could look at that
[1:01:57] uh and actually see that gift
[1:01:59] demonstrate itself and try and speak
[1:02:02] against it.
[1:02:04] &gt;&gt; Satan's brazen. Amen.
[1:02:06] &gt;&gt; Is he brazen?
[1:02:09] &gt;&gt; And we're just starting on that.
[1:02:12] He said
[1:02:14] uh
[1:02:20] he said it's it's put a something in my
[1:02:22] heart that's anchored there and I didn't
[1:02:26] put it in myself.
[1:02:28] This isn't something that we learned or
[1:02:31] just got educated into. But God, the
[1:02:34] Holy Ghost, he said, put it there.
[1:02:38] A scripture that is used frequently in
[1:02:41] the message. Whom shall we whom shall he
[1:02:44] teach knowledge?
[1:02:46] And whom shall he make to understand
[1:02:49] doctrine? Them that are weaned from the
[1:02:52] milk and drawn from the breast? For
[1:02:56] precept must be upon precept, and line
[1:03:00] upon line, line upon line, here a
[1:03:03] little, and there a little. For with
[1:03:04] stammering lips, and another tongue will
[1:03:07] I speak to this people. And to whom he
[1:03:10] said, this is the rest, wherewith ye may
[1:03:14] cause the weary to rest, and this is the
[1:03:17] refreshing, yet they would not come.
[1:03:19] Here God is offering them the very uh
[1:03:21] the very thing that their soul cries out
[1:03:24] for but and yet they would not come.
[1:03:26] Line upon line and precept upon precept.
[1:03:29] He said who will we teach? Who shall he
[1:03:32] teach knowledge?
[1:03:35] And then uh it it says in John Jesus
[1:03:38] speaking of the Holy Spirit, but the
[1:03:41] comforter which is the Holy Ghost when
[1:03:44] whom the father will send in my name, he
[1:03:47] shall teach you all things and bring all
[1:03:50] things to your remembrance
[1:03:53] whatsoever I have said unto you. And in
[1:03:57] Timothy, it says first 2 Timothy 2:2,
[1:04:00] "And the things that thou hast heard of
[1:04:04] me among many witnesses, the same commit
[1:04:08] thou to faithful men who shall be able
[1:04:12] to teach others also." So you see the
[1:04:16] process is God speaks to his appointed
[1:04:19] servant. God to Moses. God spoke to
[1:04:24] Paul. Jesus spoke to the disciples. And
[1:04:26] he chose certain disciples. That's
[1:04:29] that's just the way he works. And God,
[1:04:32] whether the people want to accept it or
[1:04:34] not, he called one man in this
[1:04:36] generation. Only one had that kind of
[1:04:39] vindication.
[1:04:41] The the the vindication was simply to
[1:04:44] identify the vessel that God was going
[1:04:46] to teach. Amen.
[1:04:49] &gt;&gt; Shall I say that again? The vindication
[1:04:52] and all the supernatural was to attract
[1:04:54] the eyes of the people so that they
[1:04:57] could focus and see the one vessel that
[1:05:00] God was using in that capacity because
[1:05:03] that was the one that God was going to
[1:05:05] teach.
[1:05:07] &gt;&gt; That was the supernatural divine aspect
[1:05:10] of God. And that's why I said as I
[1:05:12] repeated on on Wednesday, he said, "I
[1:05:15] couldn't do anything about it. I can't
[1:05:17] do anything about that because the very
[1:05:20] he he he'd be standing there in front of
[1:05:22] a person and the pillar of fire would
[1:05:24] move from there and go out over the
[1:05:26] congregation and rest over another
[1:05:28] person and he'd have he'd have to go
[1:05:29] over there. Who who is that? That's God
[1:05:32] teaching him. It's not him, it's her."
[1:05:36] &gt;&gt; How else would he know that kind of
[1:05:38] instruction? And so that's what he was
[1:05:40] depending on all the time. He was
[1:05:42] depending on that pillar of fire when
[1:05:44] the seals were being made known. He was
[1:05:46] depending on that. He said, "I'd have
[1:05:48] been I'd have made such a horrible
[1:05:50] mistake if he hadn't come." He said,
[1:05:52] "That pillar of fire hanging there for
[1:05:54] for all those hours about 8 hours. What
[1:05:57] what what was it?" It was God teaching
[1:06:00] him so then that he could teach us and
[1:06:04] he could teach the ministry. And he goes
[1:06:06] on to say in the smian
[1:06:09] church age in every age we have exactly
[1:06:13] notice the same pattern.
[1:06:16] &gt;&gt; I'd like the congregation to say it same
[1:06:19] pattern. It's not some other some other
[1:06:23] guy's idea.
[1:06:24] &gt;&gt; It's not what the it's not what the uh
[1:06:27] theological school or anyone else or any
[1:06:29] preacher anything else. It's the same
[1:06:32] pattern. He said, "And that is why the
[1:06:34] light comes through this through some
[1:06:37] God-given messenger in a certain area
[1:06:42] and then from that messenger there
[1:06:44] spreads the light through the ministry
[1:06:46] of others who have been faithfully
[1:06:49] taught." Do you believe it?
[1:06:51] &gt;&gt; That that is the pattern.
[1:06:55] &gt;&gt; It's not that the prophet simply
[1:06:58] delivers it to the sheep and then all
[1:07:00] the sheep start teaching themselves.
[1:07:02] Amen.
[1:07:03] &gt;&gt; Or teaching one another.
[1:07:05] &gt;&gt; It's that God sends his message to his
[1:07:08] Moses or his messenger or his prophet
[1:07:11] and from there it is given to the
[1:07:13] ministers.
[1:07:14] &gt;&gt; And the ministers are also to take the
[1:07:17] same word and teach the people under
[1:07:20] that same uncction.
[1:07:22] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And I thank God this morning
[1:07:24] for that same Holy Spirit.
[1:07:28] I thank God for its testimony here in
[1:07:30] this congregation. I thank God for its
[1:07:33] testimony around the world. I thank God
[1:07:36] that I could go and visit brother Dio's
[1:07:38] work and see that mighty thing that God
[1:07:40] had done in the Congo and stand there in
[1:07:43] in a humble state and say, "Oh God, this
[1:07:47] work is of you."
[1:07:49] &gt;&gt; No man, no system, no other program
[1:07:53] could do this. Hallelujah. Why doesn't
[1:07:56] the congregation rejoice over God's
[1:07:58] work?
[1:08:00] Why aren't you thankful? I'm sure you
[1:08:02] are. Express it. How wonderful it is
[1:08:06] that a god could come down and United
[1:08:10] Nations call it the poorest nation on
[1:08:12] earth. But in my assessment, it was it's
[1:08:15] the richest nation on earth.
[1:08:18] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:08:22] &gt;&gt; Glory to God.
[1:08:24] &gt;&gt; Rich in spiritual resource.
[1:08:27] I would love to be able to have the
[1:08:28] testimony and say here in the Pacific
[1:08:30] Northwest, we've sent out 5 million
[1:08:33] books in the in 205.
[1:08:36] &gt;&gt; You're quiet. I'd love to be able to say
[1:08:39] I'd love to be able to say we're able to
[1:08:41] achieve that. No, that wasn't God's
[1:08:44] choosing. God took people who were of of
[1:08:47] a poor estate. God took people where
[1:08:49] they had almost 100% unemployment.
[1:08:53] God took people and he just does it like
[1:08:55] he delivered Israel when they didn't
[1:08:57] have guns and weapons and anything else.
[1:09:00] God does things so that it's evident I'm
[1:09:02] doing it. Hallelujah. There's no room
[1:09:05] for any flesh to glory. God does it.
[1:09:08] Hallelujah. I rejoice today. I love it
[1:09:12] when God does it.
[1:09:15] &gt;&gt; And I'm so thankful if God just sets out
[1:09:17] and says, "Okay, Coil, you can have a
[1:09:19] little peace. You can just have a little
[1:09:22] part of this, but I'm the one that's
[1:09:23] doing it. I'll take your little gift and
[1:09:26] I'll I'll expand it. I'll take your
[1:09:29] little handful, your little offering or
[1:09:31] whatever, and I'll send it out to
[1:09:32] multitudes. Oh God, multiply our little
[1:09:36] loav, multiply our little fishes.
[1:09:38] Hallelujah. Fill the baskets full. Feed
[1:09:41] the hungry people.
[1:09:45] &gt;&gt; Amen. Hallelujah.
[1:09:48] &gt;&gt; And he gives it to the messenger and the
[1:09:51] messenger spreads it through the
[1:09:53] ministry to the others who have been
[1:09:55] faithfully taught. Tell you friends,
[1:09:58] this isn't something you just drop down
[1:10:00] pour out of a can. This is when people
[1:10:03] wait on God.
[1:10:05] I've been around a lot of churches and
[1:10:08] ministers and I I I have to say publicly
[1:10:12] my heart has been heavy and grieved some
[1:10:14] time because I've known that the
[1:10:16] minister doesn't seem in at least by my
[1:10:20] assessment to spend much time with the
[1:10:23] word or much time in the message. But if
[1:10:26] you're going to have a people that's
[1:10:28] faithfully taught or a minister that's
[1:10:30] faithfully taught, he's got to give
[1:10:32] himself and let the Holy Spirit teach
[1:10:34] him. Teach. Amen.
[1:10:38] &gt;&gt; And if you haven't got that spiritual
[1:10:40] part that's been deposited there for
[1:10:42] that gift and for that calling, you can
[1:10:44] never receive that instruction the same
[1:10:47] way.
[1:10:48] &gt;&gt; It's a spiritual thing. Yes.
[1:10:54] &gt;&gt; Joseph's brothers all may have had
[1:10:55] dreams, but none of them were recorded
[1:10:57] in the word of God.
[1:10:59] &gt;&gt; No doubt they dreamed, but none of them
[1:11:00] were recorded because his dream was a
[1:11:02] spiritual dream.
[1:11:04] &gt;&gt; His work was a spiritual work.
[1:11:06] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:11:07] &gt;&gt; Not saying the people don't have
[1:11:09] spiritual things. I think you understand
[1:11:10] me. But brother Brandham says this is
[1:11:12] the pattern.
[1:11:14] &gt;&gt; That's the pattern. There is no other
[1:11:16] pattern. Never has been another pattern.
[1:11:19] That is the pattern.
[1:11:23] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:11:25] &gt;&gt; Satan's kingdom is full of teaching,
[1:11:28] teaching spirits.
[1:11:31] Satan's kingdom is full of teachers.
[1:11:34] Again, the devil taketh him up into an
[1:11:36] exceeding high mountain and showeth him
[1:11:39] all the kingdoms of the world and the
[1:11:42] glory of them. How brazen.
[1:11:46] And this pattern never changes. How
[1:11:49] brazen.
[1:11:51] &gt;&gt; Satan himself, that spirit. I say, hell
[1:11:54] is full of instructors.
[1:11:57] &gt;&gt; Full of instructors.
[1:12:00] &gt;&gt; How brazen that that fallen archangel
[1:12:04] could come to the very word himself
[1:12:09] and try to teach him what the scripture
[1:12:12] meant.
[1:12:17] and showeth him all the kingdoms of the
[1:12:21] world and the glory of them.
[1:12:26] He attempts to teach the word
[1:12:30] to the word in flesh himself.
[1:12:33] and the adversary,
[1:12:38] that one that has the least or even zero
[1:12:42] qualifications.
[1:12:45] &gt;&gt; Zero qualifications. What was his
[1:12:48] qualifications? There he is standing.
[1:12:52] What is his qualifications?
[1:12:57] Zero.
[1:12:58] no qualifications whatsoever to start to
[1:13:01] instruct, to start to teach, but he
[1:13:05] wants to now remember the adversary
[1:13:08] wants to penetrate and put it in your
[1:13:10] heart and they have things that are anti
[1:13:14] in opposition to what God obviously has
[1:13:19] done
[1:13:21] &gt;&gt; even to the point it'll start to deny
[1:13:23] the work that's happened in your own
[1:13:25] life.
[1:13:29] I've seen it at work. I've seen it at
[1:13:31] work. I'll describe it so he can pick it
[1:13:33] up sometime.
[1:13:36] There's a minister came by through here,
[1:13:38] minister of the message. And it was kind
[1:13:41] of off on a certain
[1:13:44] grand revelation.
[1:13:47] One of the first things they need to do
[1:13:48] is destabilize the person they're
[1:13:50] talking to. Cuz here the here's the
[1:13:53] individual and they're feeling, you
[1:13:56] know, they have a sense of assurance and
[1:13:58] confidence and they're just moving on in
[1:14:00] God. When Satan comes in, the adversary,
[1:14:03] your adversary always comes in first
[1:14:06] thing first thing is a a word that tries
[1:14:09] to destabilize.
[1:14:12] &gt;&gt; He looked at a brother
[1:14:15] uh looked at a brother and I happened to
[1:14:17] be standing by. He said kind of it was
[1:14:20] the whole at attitude, the whole
[1:14:22] atmosphere. It was intimidating
[1:14:24] atmosphere and the and the whole
[1:14:26] expression was intimidating. Just looked
[1:14:28] at him said, "Do you have the Holy
[1:14:30] Ghost?"
[1:14:33] Well,
[1:14:36] the brother u Well, yeah,
[1:14:41] the answer to that is I most certainly
[1:14:43] do. Do you have it? Amen.
[1:14:47] &gt;&gt; That's the answer. But that just that
[1:14:50] intimidating way because behind that if
[1:14:52] you could just get him to destabilized a
[1:14:55] wee bit, you know, then he come in and
[1:14:57] said, "Well, I have the answer for it. I
[1:14:59] got the real way that, you know, I got I
[1:15:01] got a special doctrine and this will
[1:15:03] really settle you." He was already
[1:15:05] settled before he tried to unsettle him.
[1:15:08] &gt;&gt; See that? That is that's just how brazen
[1:15:10] they are. come right up and you're all
[1:15:14] you're you're walking in the light and
[1:15:15] walking in faith and walking in trust
[1:15:17] and walking confidence and right away
[1:15:19] there's a a try to destabilize. That's
[1:15:22] exactly what he tried to do. If thou art
[1:15:23] the son of God,
[1:15:26] &gt;&gt; make these stones bread.
[1:15:29] &gt;&gt; If you're the son of God, try to
[1:15:31] destabilize them and question
[1:15:34] his office. He didn't say that there is
[1:15:37] no son of God. He was just saying if you
[1:15:39] think you're that, do you really think
[1:15:41] that you're bride? You think you're
[1:15:44] bride? You think you're born again? You
[1:15:46] think, "Oh, that's him. That's his
[1:15:49] pattern."
[1:15:50] &gt;&gt; Always his pattern.
[1:15:56] &gt;&gt; What does the What does the adversary,
[1:15:58] the devil do? And what is his nature or
[1:16:01] his character? I'm going to give you
[1:16:04] brother Brham's
[1:16:06] complete what I think is a marvelous
[1:16:10] answer.
[1:16:13] Marvelous answer. Remember you have this
[1:16:16] adversary.
[1:16:19] Taking sides with Jesus.
[1:16:21] He said, "But Jesus," now you see this
[1:16:24] is a pattern. If and if he used that
[1:16:27] pattern here, he use it all the time. He
[1:16:30] said, "But Jesus, they just tried to
[1:16:32] find every little shadow that they could
[1:16:37] find to try to belittle him."
[1:16:41] &gt;&gt; Still do.
[1:16:45] &gt;&gt; In the sight of the people, to try to
[1:16:48] belittle him in the sight of the people.
[1:16:52] And that's what the devil wants. They
[1:16:55] want to hurt your influence before the
[1:16:58] people.
[1:17:00] I tell you what, I have seen I've seen
[1:17:04] his tactics
[1:17:06] and I hear I I hear it all the time
[1:17:09] about the message about the messenger
[1:17:12] and he and he uses the same tactics
[1:17:14] within the congregation within the
[1:17:17] message. He'll use exactly the same
[1:17:19] tactics.
[1:17:21] It absolutely staggers my imagination
[1:17:26] how intelligent so-called people
[1:17:31] can take 33 years of ministry
[1:17:34] of the most unusual
[1:17:37] profound ministry that the world has
[1:17:40] ever seen and just dis and and just
[1:17:44] remove it from you know their conscious
[1:17:48] thought by just a word or two say, "Oh,
[1:17:51] well, he went off in the end.
[1:17:56] &gt;&gt; He went off in the end." Excuse me. That
[1:17:58] one sentence does it for 33 years of
[1:18:01] ministry. Can what what about what does
[1:18:04] the word say? What is what is what does
[1:18:06] the scripture say? I said, well, uh,
[1:18:11] in fact is
[1:18:13] strange. is hard for me to say, but
[1:18:15] someone that I love very, very deeply
[1:18:16] and one who helped me in the ministry,
[1:18:20] made a special trip to my house and sat
[1:18:24] on my sofa with me, just the two of us.
[1:18:28] And he came with a purpose in his mind.
[1:18:31] Was he evil? No. He loved me. He thought
[1:18:35] he was going to do the right thing.
[1:18:39] And he said, I want to ask you a
[1:18:41] question.
[1:18:45] He said, "Why do you think Brother
[1:18:47] Brandham was killed in a car accident?"
[1:18:52] You see, I'll just stop there now. That
[1:18:56] as much as I love that brother, I love
[1:18:58] him with everything I have. As much as I
[1:19:01] loved him, was he godly? A very godly
[1:19:04] man. Did he have the revelation of the
[1:19:05] message? No. But I recognized right away
[1:19:08] that that statement came to destabilize
[1:19:11] me. Amen.
[1:19:15] &gt;&gt; And out from my mouth shot an answer
[1:19:17] before I had even thought. I said, "For
[1:19:20] the same reason John the Baptist had his
[1:19:22] head cut off."
[1:19:28] &gt;&gt; And I was I was in a state of awe myself
[1:19:30] that I had said that.
[1:19:33] Amen.
[1:19:35] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:19:35] &gt;&gt; And my brother, my precious brother,
[1:19:38] opened his mouth, but there was no air
[1:19:41] that came out,
[1:19:43] &gt;&gt; much less words. Nothing came out.
[1:19:47] &gt;&gt; And then I felt the strength and the
[1:19:49] surge of the spirit of God.
[1:19:53] &gt;&gt; And I said, called him by name. I said,
[1:19:56] "My family here, they're in another part
[1:19:59] of the house.
[1:20:00] I said I love them more than I love my
[1:20:03] own life. I said I have committed them,
[1:20:06] my children and my wife to this message
[1:20:09] and nothing can change that. And that
[1:20:11] was our last conversation. Did we become
[1:20:14] enemies? Not a bit. We were as dear
[1:20:17] friends as could be right to the end of
[1:20:20] his life. You see friends, that is how
[1:20:24] Satan works. And you have to know that
[1:20:26] that's how he works because you have
[1:20:29] that adversary. That adversary will come
[1:20:32] your way at some time or another. And
[1:20:34] don't forget, I'm going to give you a
[1:20:36] title for him. He's a teacher.
[1:20:39] &gt;&gt; He's a teacher.
[1:20:40] &gt;&gt; He's going to try to take the word and
[1:20:42] instruct you.
[1:20:43] &gt;&gt; And instruct you in something that is
[1:20:45] anti to what you have received, to what
[1:20:49] you believe, to what you hold dear. your
[1:20:52] friendship, your fellowship, your
[1:20:54] church, your pastor, your deacons,
[1:20:57] whatever more. He'll be anti maybe with
[1:21:00] with the situation. You young people, he
[1:21:03] will be anti. You've been brought up and
[1:21:05] you've been raised in a certain way and
[1:21:07] you'll get things that kind of
[1:21:08] destabilize you and and and start to put
[1:21:11] distance between you and your godly
[1:21:12] parents. Shoot it down. Deny the thing
[1:21:15] right there. Give no ear to it
[1:21:18] whatsoever. That enemy is a teacher.
[1:21:21] Yes.
[1:21:22] &gt;&gt; And he'll belittle.
[1:21:25] He'll belittle and try to hinder the
[1:21:27] influence. They want to hurt the
[1:21:29] influence before the people. And that's
[1:21:31] the way you want to watch. He said,
[1:21:34] "Careful." That's what the scripture
[1:21:36] says, be sober, be vigilant. And he
[1:21:40] says, "Walk like real men of God. Talk
[1:21:43] like men of God. Act like men of God.
[1:21:47] Live like men of God." I wonder if I
[1:21:50] could say those again and have you say
[1:21:52] amen if you believe it. He said, "Walk
[1:21:56] like real men of God
[1:21:58] &gt;&gt; and talk like men of God and act like
[1:22:02] men of God and live like men of God." He
[1:22:07] said, "Because the devil, your
[1:22:09] adversary, is going about like a roaring
[1:22:12] lion trying to devour what he can." But
[1:22:15] that's his system. That's how he works.
[1:22:18] Amen.
[1:22:20] &gt;&gt; He says, "And what did they uh why did
[1:22:23] they do this? They were jealous of him."
[1:22:28] &gt;&gt; Why do people take the position they do
[1:22:30] of the messenger? Because they were
[1:22:33] jealous of that ministry. And you see
[1:22:36] any man that tries to do something for
[1:22:39] God, I'm not going to play games,
[1:22:41] friends. We got a man sitting on the
[1:22:43] platform and I tell you what, they have
[1:22:46] flown across oceans. They have sent men
[1:22:50] have done all kinds of things to try to
[1:22:52] destroy uh brother Dio's influence.
[1:22:56] &gt;&gt; I've heard the word come back to me said
[1:22:59] a certain brother said he's going to
[1:23:01] destroy your influence everywhere or
[1:23:03] anywhere he can in the world.
[1:23:07] &gt;&gt; What do you do with it? Just go on.
[1:23:11] &gt;&gt; Just say let God be the witness. Yeah.
[1:23:14] &gt;&gt; If he be true,
[1:23:16] &gt;&gt; if that be true and my influence needs
[1:23:18] to be destroyed by God's will, so be it.
[1:23:23] &gt;&gt; Because it's not going to doesn't amount
[1:23:25] to any. I want God's will.
[1:23:27] &gt;&gt; You want God's will.
[1:23:28] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:23:30] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:23:32] &gt;&gt; I love the attitude a prophet gave. He
[1:23:35] said, you know, if there is no heaven
[1:23:37] and if there is nothing, if I if I'm not
[1:23:39] going to uh if I'm not even going to
[1:23:42] attain to heaven and I'm going to be
[1:23:44] cast to hell, he said to me personally,
[1:23:47] he said he said, "If I get to crawl up
[1:23:50] on my hands and knees to his feet,
[1:23:52] Brother Eddie, and he kicks me over into
[1:23:56] hell," he said, "I'll still look up and
[1:23:58] say, "I love you."
[1:24:01] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:24:02] And I wondered why he said that to me,
[1:24:04] but I learned a great secret. What what
[1:24:07] what attit what what what kind of thing
[1:24:10] can the devil do to that kind of
[1:24:12] attitude?
[1:24:13] &gt;&gt; Here's a man says I love him even if he
[1:24:15] kicks me over into hell. It's not I got
[1:24:18] to have this, I got to have this and
[1:24:19] give me this and give me that. He says,
[1:24:22] I'm going to live this anyway. I read it
[1:24:24] just the other day. I'm going to live
[1:24:26] this anyway.
[1:24:29] &gt;&gt; Am I preaching to you?
[1:24:32] reaching down to you.
[1:24:34] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:24:36] &gt;&gt; And they were jealous of him. That's
[1:24:39] that was what's the reason they tried to
[1:24:41] belittle him. They were jealous of his
[1:24:44] ministry and that's the reason they were
[1:24:47] trying to belittle. He goes on, but he
[1:24:50] had the ministry of God and they knew
[1:24:53] that. But it was contrary to their
[1:24:56] creeds. So they were trying to belittle
[1:24:59] him.
[1:25:00] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[1:25:01] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:25:03] &gt;&gt; Wednesday, it was really special for me
[1:25:05] to have that little segment of tape that
[1:25:09] God used to speak to our brother David
[1:25:12] Laws and to have him up. I'm sure it had
[1:25:15] some spec it was special for you.
[1:25:20] &gt;&gt; But I didn't tell you this.
[1:25:23] I went to my I was looking for another
[1:25:25] tape and I was just on a different uh
[1:25:29] kind of a thought a theme
[1:25:32] and I have about almost a thousand tapes
[1:25:34] in in my closet there all set out in the
[1:25:38] years
[1:25:40] and just as I opened the door
[1:25:43] I opened the double doors of the cabinet
[1:25:45] and I was just scanning uh in the area
[1:25:48] of of the time that I thought the
[1:25:51] message I was wanting would be and my
[1:25:54] eyes just fell on
[1:25:57] uh fell on a a tape and it I just
[1:26:00] happened to scan the title cuz I'm just
[1:26:02] whole hundreds of titles in front of me
[1:26:05] and it it says u Christ identified the
[1:26:09] same in all generations and I thought
[1:26:11] you know he's he's had similar ones
[1:26:13] before but that was just worded
[1:26:15] different and I thought that's just
[1:26:17] different and then I kept on scanning
[1:26:19] and I thought you know that was worded
[1:26:21] different I went and looked at it again
[1:26:22] and read it and I thought Christ
[1:26:24] identified the same in all generations.
[1:26:26] Well, that I don't remember hearing
[1:26:28] that, you know, and uh at least not
[1:26:30] recently. And so I just kept on looking
[1:26:32] and I I thought, well, I was just having
[1:26:34] to go someplace in the car, so I thought
[1:26:37] I'm just going to take that. And I take
[1:26:39] that and when I get brother Brandham
[1:26:43] starts laying out the ministry,
[1:26:46] the prophetic ministry.
[1:26:49] And while he's going through it, I
[1:26:52] hadn't heard him. If you want to hear
[1:26:53] it, he na he nails that down so tight,
[1:26:56] there's no place to move. And I thought,
[1:26:59] ooh,
[1:27:01] he he would said, "I'm so happy to be in
[1:27:03] Tampa, Florida, and it's my first time
[1:27:06] here." And always wanted to come down be
[1:27:08] with you grand people. And he goes on
[1:27:10] like that. And then he starts laying out
[1:27:12] the ministry. He takes every scripture.
[1:27:14] And he takes the condition of the age,
[1:27:17] just takes every one. And I thought,
[1:27:19] "Ooh, is he ever is he ever getting them
[1:27:23] ready for something?
[1:27:25] He's nailing this down so tight. I just
[1:27:27] know." And they were so quiet. Oh, they
[1:27:30] were so quiet, you know, and uh he's
[1:27:34] amongst all the Pentecostal Assemblies
[1:27:36] of God people and so on. I thought it
[1:27:38] just to me, you know, as a believer, you
[1:27:41] just know that the Lord's coming in with
[1:27:42] a punch,
[1:27:44] a double knockout punch. And he comes at
[1:27:47] the end, he says, "Let let's just call
[1:27:48] some people." So, he calls uh 10 people
[1:27:53] and uh what number will we call? and he
[1:27:56] starts with A1 to 10 and he can't find
[1:27:58] A1 and you know and I'm I'm sitting
[1:28:01] there listening I think you know this is
[1:28:03] you know there's almost spending so much
[1:28:05] time where's A1 and so on so forth when
[1:28:08] you think that kind of ministry for me I
[1:28:10] just like to get on with it you know and
[1:28:13] uh so he gets the 10 people up and
[1:28:15] they're there and while he's in the
[1:28:17] midst of dealing with these 10 you know
[1:28:19] and he goes down into the audience and
[1:28:21] how many here don't have prayer cards oh
[1:28:23] yes there's many you know and you you
[1:28:25] know that you're stranger to me. We
[1:28:27] don't know each other and so on. And
[1:28:29] after a little while, you know, he calls
[1:28:31] this one out and calls that one out. And
[1:28:33] I thought, and now the people, of
[1:28:35] course, the people are responding. And
[1:28:37] while I was listening to that, just like
[1:28:39] the Holy Spirit spoke to me and said,
[1:28:41] "Now, when Jesus did that to the woman
[1:28:44] at the well,
[1:28:46] she didn't have a a great emotional,
[1:28:50] you know, uh, release when he began to
[1:28:54] reveal the secret of her heart. That is
[1:28:57] when she got it." These people were dead
[1:28:59] quiet. But then when he began to
[1:29:01] manifest it, then they went into
[1:29:02] rejoicing. When when when Jesus revealed
[1:29:05] the secret of her heart, she felt
[1:29:07] silent.
[1:29:09] &gt;&gt; She recognized, "You must be a prophet
[1:29:13] here. He's doing it and they're not
[1:29:14] getting it." And I thought, "They're not
[1:29:17] getting it.
[1:29:18] &gt;&gt; They're not getting it.
[1:29:20] What the woman at the well got, they're
[1:29:22] not getting.
[1:29:25] &gt;&gt; And that's why they couldn't go to the
[1:29:26] next step because they didn't get that
[1:29:28] one." Amen.
[1:29:30] &gt;&gt; And I'm just listening on and finally I
[1:29:32] hear him call out and say, "There's a
[1:29:35] man sitting down there in a a white
[1:29:37] shirt. You need a job and you need the
[1:29:40] Holy Ghost and you need a job, too." And
[1:29:42] I thought, "There it is." And I've been
[1:29:44] searching for that one. Been searching
[1:29:45] for where God had called our our brother
[1:29:48] David Laws out. And and there it was
[1:29:50] right on that tape. But I didn't want to
[1:29:52] tell you on Wednesday. I didn't have the
[1:29:53] time to tell you how it was so
[1:29:55] supernatural that I had come to it. And
[1:29:57] I was actually looking for another one
[1:29:59] was directed to that one.
[1:30:01] &gt;&gt; And then I called Sister Violet and I
[1:30:03] called uh Brother David a little bit
[1:30:05] later. They couldn't remember exactly
[1:30:06] the title, but when I began to uh you
[1:30:09] notice when I had brother David up here,
[1:30:11] he actually was saying the words while
[1:30:12] it was being said because they
[1:30:14] remembered so well. You know, the
[1:30:16] supernatural part of God that's eternal.
[1:30:21] &gt;&gt; There's no time. There's no limit on it.
[1:30:24] And it's the supernatural part that they
[1:30:27] were jealous over the supernatural
[1:30:29] thing. I want to say to you, you
[1:30:32] wouldn't be sitting here today if God
[1:30:33] had not done a supernatural work in your
[1:30:36] life.
[1:30:37] &gt;&gt; When I look across this congregation and
[1:30:39] just go back a few years in your life, I
[1:30:41] remember it all very well. And I my mind
[1:30:44] is just filled with uh not testimony.
[1:30:47] It's not testimony.
[1:30:49] People say it's testimony. My mind is
[1:30:52] just filled with a supernatural God
[1:30:55] doing supernatural things, taking
[1:30:58] children out of the very depths of
[1:31:01] darkness and confusion, out of their
[1:31:03] terrible state, some religious, some in
[1:31:06] despair, some in the world, some in
[1:31:08] snared in terrible situations, and God
[1:31:12] just deliver them in a moment. I want to
[1:31:15] say today publicly, our God's a great
[1:31:17] God.
[1:31:19] &gt;&gt; And he has done supernatural things.
[1:31:22] &gt;&gt; And that supernatural thing is an
[1:31:25] eternal thing.
[1:31:27] &gt;&gt; That's not for time. It's eternal.
[1:31:30] &gt;&gt; And that's what God is continuing to
[1:31:32] build on is that supernatural
[1:31:35] &gt;&gt; work.
[1:31:37] Amen.
[1:31:39] &gt;&gt; All right, let me just carry on.
[1:31:48] God promised Israel that if they would
[1:31:51] obey the voice of his angel,
[1:31:55] then he would be then he would be an
[1:31:58] adversary to their adversary.
[1:32:02] I want to announce to you as a
[1:32:04] congregation and all that are hearing my
[1:32:06] voice
[1:32:08] in this day particularly
[1:32:11] I want God to be an adversary to my
[1:32:15] adversary.
[1:32:22] &gt;&gt; I want him. And in the Old Testament, it
[1:32:25] has a slightly different meaning,
[1:32:28] but it is that God would bind
[1:32:35] my adversary,
[1:32:37] that God would put my adversary, who's
[1:32:40] here contending with me and contending
[1:32:43] with you, I want to announce to you, God
[1:32:46] will bind that adversary.
[1:32:50] &gt;&gt; He will distress him. Amen.
[1:32:53] &gt;&gt; The word means and God gave uh God gave
[1:32:57] some commandment and listen I want to I
[1:32:59] want you to catch listen this whole
[1:33:01] congregation please carefully. He said
[1:33:04] through Moses he said behold I send an
[1:33:08] angel before thee to keep thee in the
[1:33:12] way and to bring thee to the place which
[1:33:15] I have prepared. I want to stop there.
[1:33:18] He has sent his angel before them. That
[1:33:21] angel of the Lord, that same angel of
[1:33:24] the Lord has been with God's people from
[1:33:28] all time. That same angel, he manifested
[1:33:31] himself in a very special way to a
[1:33:34] generation that was given over to
[1:33:36] technology. He allowed his picture to be
[1:33:39] taken not only in America, in Germany or
[1:33:43] at Switzerland. In Germany for sure and
[1:33:46] you can see it coming down from the
[1:33:47] ceiling. They shot it with the camera
[1:33:49] several times. It's not just a a double
[1:33:53] exposure, which they try to say this one
[1:33:54] was it it had. And of course, George E.
[1:33:57] Lacy proved it wasn't, but they actually
[1:34:00] shot it several times coming down from
[1:34:02] the ceiling and going back up.
[1:34:05] &gt;&gt; The angel of the Lord, the pillar of
[1:34:08] fire. Do you believe that?
[1:34:10] &gt;&gt; And he said that, "Behold, I send an
[1:34:13] angel before thee to keep thee in the
[1:34:16] way." That's number one. He's assigned
[1:34:19] to keep you in the way.
[1:34:22] &gt;&gt; Why keep you in the way? Because you've
[1:34:24] got an opponent. You've got an adversary
[1:34:27] that's trying to bump you off the trail,
[1:34:30] &gt;&gt; trying to distract you from the main
[1:34:33] purpose. Hallelujah.
[1:34:35] &gt;&gt; To get us on another agenda. He's so
[1:34:38] subtle.
[1:34:40] &gt;&gt; He'll try to get natural things to mean
[1:34:42] more than spiritual things. try to get
[1:34:44] all kinds of pressures upon you so that
[1:34:47] your life and the supernatural part of
[1:34:49] your life. Oh, I want to make that your
[1:34:51] focus. I don't care how busy you are. I
[1:34:54] don't care about those things. That's
[1:34:56] not the part of it. Or what kind of work
[1:34:58] you do or what kind of profession you
[1:35:00] have and and what you aim to do in your
[1:35:02] future life, young people. But the main
[1:35:04] thing is if you don't have your
[1:35:06] spiritual, the thing that God did for
[1:35:08] you spiritually as your main focus,
[1:35:10] you're going to miss out. Amen. That's
[1:35:13] right.
[1:35:13] &gt;&gt; On the rich things of God.
[1:35:17] &gt;&gt; I've sent my angel before thee to keep
[1:35:19] thee in the way and to bring thee into
[1:35:22] the place which I have prepared. I go to
[1:35:26] prepare a place for you. This angel of
[1:35:30] the Lord has been commissioned to take
[1:35:33] us to the place that's been prepared for
[1:35:36] us. We don't have a physical land. We
[1:35:39] don't have a land of Israel to that.
[1:35:41] that we're going to be gathered to. We
[1:35:43] only have one land. And I'm going to ask
[1:35:45] you, friends, when this short life is
[1:35:47] over and it's a reality to us today, one
[1:35:51] of our own people is perhaps moments
[1:35:53] away, moments away or an hour or two
[1:35:56] away from crossing over to that land. Is
[1:35:58] it real or isn't it real? Is it a real
[1:36:01] place?
[1:36:03] &gt;&gt; And you're going to end at that door
[1:36:05] someday, young people. You're going to
[1:36:06] end there either sooner or later, but
[1:36:09] you're going to end there unless the
[1:36:11] rapture takes you ahead of time, but
[1:36:12] you're going to end there. You want to
[1:36:14] know that you've made that your focus,
[1:36:16] that you made that spiritual thing that
[1:36:19] God did in your in your heart and life,
[1:36:21] that's your focus.
[1:36:23] &gt;&gt; Don't let Satan ever take it away and
[1:36:25] make it second place for you.
[1:36:30] &gt;&gt; And he said, beware of him
[1:36:33] and obey his voice. Provoke him not, for
[1:36:37] he will not pardon your transgressions,
[1:36:38] for my name is in him. But if thou shalt
[1:36:41] indeed obey his voice, listen, and do
[1:36:44] all that I speak, then I will be an
[1:36:49] enemy unto thine enemies, and an
[1:36:53] adversary unto thine adversary. If
[1:36:56] you'll hear this angel, if you'll hear
[1:36:59] this voice, then I will be an enemy to
[1:37:02] your enemy. and I'll be an adversary to
[1:37:06] your adversary. I say, God, let me stand
[1:37:10] right in that place.
[1:37:12] I want you to take my adversary and bind
[1:37:15] him.
[1:37:16] &gt;&gt; I want you to hinder his way.
[1:37:19] &gt;&gt; I want you to steal his voice.
[1:37:22] &gt;&gt; And the yah, the scripture is that I he
[1:37:24] I'll put him in distress.
[1:37:28] &gt;&gt; Glory to God.
[1:37:31] Rather than you be in distress, why not
[1:37:34] you be in joy and have him in distress?
[1:37:38] &gt;&gt; I'll put him in distress.
[1:37:40] &gt;&gt; If you'll just hear my voice.
[1:37:43] &gt;&gt; Follow this pattern. I'm going to teach
[1:37:46] Moses. Moses going to teach the Aaron,
[1:37:50] the Levites. They're going to teach the
[1:37:52] people the ministry. It's
[1:37:54] responsibility.
[1:37:56] I'll tell you what, friends. You don't
[1:37:58] know what it is. the kind of pressure
[1:38:00] and the kind of responsibility that it
[1:38:03] is to wait on God and seek to have the
[1:38:06] word of God for the people on at at a
[1:38:08] given meeting. It's a great burden, a
[1:38:11] great responsibility. And I seek to
[1:38:13] discharge it with all the sincerity of
[1:38:15] my heart because you need to be able to
[1:38:17] go out of here and be guided because I I
[1:38:21] recognize this morning you have an
[1:38:23] adversary. You have an opponent. You
[1:38:26] have an enemy. is anti to what God has
[1:38:29] for you.
[1:38:32] &gt;&gt; God wants to prosper you. He'll bring
[1:38:34] you to drought. God wants to pour water
[1:38:36] upon your life. He wants to bring you to
[1:38:38] a famine and a dry time. I say, "Deny
[1:38:42] him."
[1:38:43] &gt;&gt; Amen. Hear the voice of the angel of God
[1:38:48] &gt;&gt; and you'll have good success.
[1:38:54] The angel of the Lord has confirmed the
[1:38:57] supernatural element of this message.
[1:39:00] Listen, without the supernatural
[1:39:02] element, I'm belaboring these points a
[1:39:05] wee bit, but stay with me, please.
[1:39:08] Without the supernatural element, the
[1:39:10] supernatural, as I said Wednesday, is
[1:39:12] the element. I can't help it.
[1:39:15] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:39:16] &gt;&gt; Moses couldn't help it that there was a
[1:39:18] burning bush. Amen.
[1:39:20] &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham couldn't help it. Paul
[1:39:23] couldn't help it that he wasn't
[1:39:24] following Jesus in the flesh, but he
[1:39:26] couldn't help it that the revelation of
[1:39:28] God came to him. He couldn't help it
[1:39:30] that God gave him that position.
[1:39:34] That supernatural
[1:39:36] one day when something struck you, you
[1:39:40] couldn't help it.
[1:39:42] Look at you young people here at this
[1:39:44] last camp. We've had camp for 20 years.
[1:39:48] We've had uh a number always gets really
[1:39:51] stirred and moved. And there's people
[1:39:53] here that are now married and got
[1:39:54] families that could say it was at a
[1:39:57] certain camp maybe 20 years ago, 15
[1:40:00] years ago at a certain camp. Maybe it
[1:40:03] was a certain service. It's not just
[1:40:04] always camp, but there was a a breeze
[1:40:06] that began to something of God,
[1:40:09] something divine
[1:40:12] &gt;&gt; that begin to happen.
[1:40:14] &gt;&gt; I want to glorify that. Amen.
[1:40:20] &gt;&gt; Some of you young men, you could in no
[1:40:22] wise deliver yourself
[1:40:24] &gt;&gt; from what you were in.
[1:40:26] &gt;&gt; And if God had told me uh 3 months
[1:40:28] before that in another 6 months, these
[1:40:31] men are going to be delivered. These
[1:40:33] young women are going to be sitting
[1:40:34] here. They're not they're not going to
[1:40:37] be a concern. They're going to be a
[1:40:38] concern to the devil.
[1:40:41] &gt;&gt; They're going to be sitting there. I'm
[1:40:42] going to deliver them.
[1:40:44] &gt;&gt; I'm going to do this thing.
[1:40:46] I' I'd have been I I'd have had a hard
[1:40:48] time believing you. So when God did it,
[1:40:50] it startled me.
[1:40:53] &gt;&gt; And when that happens, you want to give
[1:40:55] God all the glory.
[1:40:58] &gt;&gt; You want to keep uh want to keep moving
[1:41:00] everything forward in that direction.
[1:41:04] &gt;&gt; I say continue to listen to that voice,
[1:41:06] &gt;&gt; that thing that spoke to you,
[1:41:09] &gt;&gt; that thing that moved you.
[1:41:11] &gt;&gt; All you have to do is you say, "Well,
[1:41:12] what do you do when you get
[1:41:13] discouraged?" you just go go for a walk,
[1:41:18] go in your room and go back to that
[1:41:21] moment and say, "I know that was you.
[1:41:24] &gt;&gt; I know that was you that spoke to me,
[1:41:26] God. I know that was you that talked to
[1:41:29] me,
[1:41:30] &gt;&gt; and I'm going to thank you for that
[1:41:31] moment.
[1:41:32] &gt;&gt; I don't feel it now, but I thank you for
[1:41:35] that moment because that was a
[1:41:37] supernatural thing, and that is you."
[1:41:39] Amen.
[1:41:41] &gt;&gt; And you'll find that same God will come
[1:41:43] back and honor
[1:41:44] &gt;&gt; that moment with you.
[1:41:54] &gt;&gt; Take the supernatural
[1:41:57] out of this message. If you take the
[1:41:59] supernatural element out of this
[1:42:01] message, all you have is a bunch of
[1:42:03] doctrines.
[1:42:07] just quickly.
[1:42:11] I don't want to bore you,
[1:42:13] but here's the title of a number of
[1:42:15] messages, and I have something I want to
[1:42:17] get to you before I close. In the
[1:42:20] message, Moses commission. Brother Bram
[1:42:22] says, "If thou will indeed obey his
[1:42:25] voice," he's reading this scripture. "If
[1:42:27] thou will indeed obey his voice, do all
[1:42:29] that I speak, then I will be an enemy to
[1:42:31] thine enemy, an adversary to thy
[1:42:33] adversaries. For my angel shall go
[1:42:35] before thee, gifts and callings without
[1:42:37] without repentance. But if thou intend
[1:42:39] indeed obey his voice, do all that I
[1:42:42] speak, then I'll be an enemy to thine
[1:42:44] enemies, an adversary to thy adversary.
[1:42:46] For my angel shall go before thee. Obey
[1:42:49] the voice of the angel. But if thou will
[1:42:51] indeed obey his voice, and do all that I
[1:42:53] speak, then I'll be an enemy to thine
[1:42:55] enemies, and an adversary to thy
[1:42:57] adversaries, for mine angel shall go
[1:42:58] before thee. Manifestation of the
[1:43:00] spirit. But if thou wilt indeed obey his
[1:43:02] voice and do all that I speak, then I
[1:43:05] will be an enemy unto thy enemies, and
[1:43:07] an adversary to thy adversaries. For my
[1:43:09] angels shall go before thee. My angel
[1:43:12] shall go before thee. That message. And
[1:43:14] if thou will be indeed obey his voice
[1:43:16] and to all that I speak, then I'll be an
[1:43:18] enemy to thine enemies and an adversary
[1:43:20] to thy adversary. For my angel shall go
[1:43:22] before thee in the message of pillar of
[1:43:24] fire. But if thou indeed obey his voice
[1:43:27] and do all that I speak, then I'll be an
[1:43:29] enemy to thine enemy and an adversary to
[1:43:31] thy adversary. For my angel shall go
[1:43:33] before thee. Friends,
[1:43:35] &gt;&gt; I haven't gone halfway through them. Do
[1:43:38] you think for a moment? Will you
[1:43:41] seriously ponder that this messenger was
[1:43:45] going back to that
[1:43:48] and and recalling before the people and
[1:43:52] before God?
[1:43:54] I have. He had all kinds of critics and
[1:43:59] enemy out there, adversaries that he was
[1:44:03] trusting in. What was he trusting in the
[1:44:06] supernatural part?
[1:44:09] &gt;&gt; It was God that sent the angel. It was
[1:44:11] God that pillar of fire that came down.
[1:44:14] That was God. He's spinning his
[1:44:15] confidence back there. You did that.
[1:44:20] &gt;&gt; Joseph when he got to Egypt. Joseph when
[1:44:22] he was sold. Joseph when he was in
[1:44:24] Piper's house, Joseph when Piper's wife
[1:44:27] tried to seduce him and and left his
[1:44:30] coat in her hand and because of that he
[1:44:32] gets thrown into prison. He could have
[1:44:34] been saying all the time, all I know is
[1:44:36] I dreamed a dream. All I know is I
[1:44:39] dreamed a dream and I saw I saw 11
[1:44:42] chiefs fall down and bow before me. All
[1:44:45] I know is I saw the stars 11 stars and
[1:44:48] the sun and the moon. I saw that he
[1:44:50] could only go back and that my brother,
[1:44:52] my sister, he never got any animosity.
[1:44:56] He never got any bitterness. I get so
[1:44:59] sick and tired of people have one little
[1:45:01] flaw, one little thing happen in life
[1:45:03] and they just grind on that and grind
[1:45:07] till they get better. I say grow up.
[1:45:11] &gt;&gt; Amen. Grow up in the name of the Lord.
[1:45:14] How in the world are is that thing so
[1:45:16] important that we're going to let our
[1:45:18] spiritual life just be dried up out of
[1:45:21] us? I say forget the thing. Hallelujah.
[1:45:24] Someone did you wrong? Forgive him.
[1:45:28] Forget it. Somebody's owe you money.
[1:45:30] Forget it.
[1:45:32] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:45:34] &gt;&gt; Well, how can I forget it? If you don't,
[1:45:36] you'll dry up. I say I sooner stay
[1:45:39] prosperous and in my spiritual life and
[1:45:42] have a have a a clear face before God
[1:45:45] almighty. And Joseph I Joseph's a
[1:45:48] wonderful example.
[1:45:50] &gt;&gt; A wonderful example.
[1:45:52] He is the example of Jesus Christ and
[1:45:55] he's our example because we want to be
[1:45:58] like him. And that's why I've been
[1:45:59] saying we don't have a lot of record of
[1:46:02] Jesus in his early life but we have it
[1:46:04] in Joseph and he never had. Just think
[1:46:06] of it friends. His very dream that the
[1:46:09] people hated was the very thing that was
[1:46:13] going to save them.
[1:46:16] &gt;&gt; And you have a testimony. You have a
[1:46:18] life in God. You have something and
[1:46:21] people don't understand it. Maybe family
[1:46:24] don't understand it. But let it be known
[1:46:26] to you that you actually possess. And
[1:46:28] the spiritual supernatural thing that
[1:46:30] God has done in you is their very
[1:46:32] salvation.
[1:46:35] Hallelujah. It's their very salvation.
[1:46:38] And it took years for it to happen. But
[1:46:41] he just kept going on day after day and
[1:46:44] year after year. He was forgotten in
[1:46:47] jail, in prison, and had to spend two
[1:46:49] years there
[1:46:52] &gt;&gt; because a woman tried to seduce him and
[1:46:54] got misunderstood and his his master was
[1:46:57] wroth with him. And then the butler and
[1:47:00] the baker and the butler forgets him.
[1:47:03] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:47:04] and they and continually he has that
[1:47:06] supernatural thing still leading him on.
[1:47:09] But he's but but look his condition.
[1:47:11] Look his estate.
[1:47:13] &gt;&gt; You weren't in you weren't in his
[1:47:14] prison. You haven't had that kind of
[1:47:17] reversal. That was Christ in Joseph.
[1:47:21] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. We don't have any right to
[1:47:23] have the feelings we have.
[1:47:25] &gt;&gt; Absolutely none whatsoever. He just kept
[1:47:27] a pure spirit before God.
[1:47:31] Hallelujah. He kept a pure spirit before
[1:47:33] God.
[1:47:38] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:47:38] &gt;&gt; He didn't put his own self forward.
[1:47:42] He just had such a pure spirit.
[1:47:45] No wonder Brother Brandon read about
[1:47:46] Joseph, began to weep and went into his
[1:47:49] closet and said, "Oh, God, I'd so thank
[1:47:51] you that you sent a man by the name of
[1:47:53] Joseph by my way and was inspired to
[1:47:55] call his son Joseph when he when he
[1:47:58] would be born."
[1:48:00] What a thing it was.
[1:48:02] And then he gets gets hauled out of the
[1:48:06] prison.
[1:48:07] Save yourself.
[1:48:10] And he goes before Pharaoh now. Not
[1:48:12] Piper, but Pharaoh.
[1:48:16] And tells him, you're going to have
[1:48:18] seven years of plenty, seven years of
[1:48:20] famine. You need to store everything up,
[1:48:23] and you need to do it this way. What's
[1:48:24] he doing? He is teaching
[1:48:28] Pharaoh how to run the country.
[1:48:31] &gt;&gt; That's what he's doing.
[1:48:32] &gt;&gt; He's actually teaching him. And he got
[1:48:35] taught because he had a supernatural
[1:48:38] part of him
[1:48:40] &gt;&gt; given to him.
[1:48:42] &gt;&gt; And they that mocked him said, "Oh, he's
[1:48:44] a dreamer." The very dream that saved
[1:48:47] nations,
[1:48:50] &gt;&gt; that very ability.
[1:48:53] &gt;&gt; But he never once. And then his brothers
[1:48:55] come
[1:48:56] and he sees the vision fulfilled and he
[1:48:58] sees them bowing before him with their
[1:49:01] faces right to the ground.
[1:49:04] There was not one twinge in him. I told
[1:49:07] you so.
[1:49:11] &gt;&gt; Before you put me in the pit, I told you
[1:49:13] so. There wasn't that at all. There
[1:49:16] wasn't one twinge,
[1:49:19] not one twinge of of of gratitude in his
[1:49:21] heart. Well, finally it happened.
[1:49:28] We're so given over to these kind of
[1:49:31] fleshly attitudes.
[1:49:32] &gt;&gt; Say, "Oh, God, wash it away from us."
[1:49:36] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:49:37] &gt;&gt; And then they start to weep and oh, this
[1:49:41] is Joseph now the recompense comes. No,
[1:49:45] no, no. He said
[1:49:49] God did this.
[1:49:51] This is God. God. He saw God in it all.
[1:49:54] God did this
[1:49:55] &gt;&gt; to preserve life.
[1:49:59] &gt;&gt; Oh, what a marvelous,
[1:50:01] &gt;&gt; marvelous character. What a marvelous
[1:50:03] attitude.
[1:50:12] I would say that supernatural aspect of
[1:50:15] his life is what taught him,
[1:50:20] guided him and preserved the life of his
[1:50:23] people.
[1:50:29] Hallelujah.
[1:50:36] I'm just going to close with this little
[1:50:37] thought.
[1:50:41] It's not really a little thought. I'd
[1:50:43] like to spend some time on it.
[1:50:46] But there is a
[1:50:48] you know there's a characteristic and
[1:50:50] that's why I can I can go to Joseph's
[1:50:52] early life and then just bring it right
[1:50:54] up to today.
[1:50:58] But in the very first part of his life,
[1:51:01] before he's gone into Egypt, before he's
[1:51:03] gone and been sold and so on, he's
[1:51:06] already hated as a favored son. He's
[1:51:08] hated
[1:51:12] and the and the Bible says his brethren
[1:51:14] cannot speak peaceibly. So that's the
[1:51:16] condition. He's he's in such a
[1:51:20] difficulty with his family, with his
[1:51:22] brothers and and and the thing you can
[1:51:24] see there's such hostility. Now I
[1:51:26] remember
[1:51:28] all of us. He had 11
[1:51:30] against him with such hostility.
[1:51:34] And his father calls him says, "Joseph,
[1:51:40] I want you to go to your brethren."
[1:51:44] What he's doing, he says, "I want you to
[1:51:46] send I want to send you up to these
[1:51:48] fellas that hate you."
[1:51:50] He doesn't put it in those words, but I
[1:51:52] want you to go to your brethren and
[1:51:53] they're tending the sheep and tending
[1:51:55] the flocks and go and see them and see
[1:51:58] how they're fairing and and come and let
[1:52:01] me know. And Joseph said something
[1:52:06] that I would like to superimpose upon
[1:52:08] the hearts and souls of the people this
[1:52:10] morning.
[1:52:12] He said these three words.
[1:52:15] Here am I.
[1:52:19] That
[1:52:21] that attitude never left Joseph.
[1:52:29] &gt;&gt; Wherever wherever life led him, he just
[1:52:32] kept saying as it were in that attitude,
[1:52:35] here am I.
[1:52:38] &gt;&gt; You're being elevated. You're over
[1:52:40] Piper's house. Here am I.
[1:52:45] You're a man of distinction, a man of
[1:52:47] prosperity. Everything's prospering
[1:52:50] under you. Says, "Here am I." In a few
[1:52:53] days, he's in prison.
[1:52:58] Here am I.
[1:53:00] &gt;&gt; Whatever it is, in adversity,
[1:53:04] here am I.
[1:53:08] And then come to the very
[1:53:11] apex of his life under Pharaoh.
[1:53:14] It was still just here am I? He was
[1:53:17] never moved off of that. And then his
[1:53:20] brethren coming and finally his father.
[1:53:24] And this to me is a very outstanding.
[1:53:28] None of us can imagine because we have
[1:53:30] never been put in that position and
[1:53:32] never will be when he is next to the
[1:53:35] pharaoh
[1:53:37] in such wealth and such power and such
[1:53:40] dignity, such integrity and such uh God
[1:53:47] has so raised him up. Then he comes to
[1:53:50] his father who's now aged. Goes to see
[1:53:54] his father.
[1:53:58] He loses all of that dignity. He loses
[1:54:02] all of that. It's still that here am I.
[1:54:05] It's just that humility, you know,
[1:54:07] whatever the situation calls for. And he
[1:54:10] runs and embraces his father and and
[1:54:14] weeps upon his neck, the scripture says,
[1:54:16] a good while. And that father remained
[1:54:19] so endeared to him. I thought you know
[1:54:22] this is remarkable
[1:54:24] especially young men they get feeling
[1:54:26] you know kind of their strength and the
[1:54:28] strength of their youth and the girls
[1:54:31] perhaps uh you know their attractiveness
[1:54:33] and their maturity and everything else
[1:54:35] and and and this world's attitude is
[1:54:38] right away that the that the the father
[1:54:40] or the mother the the respect and the
[1:54:43] dignity seems to just dissipate.
[1:54:47] This world really friends what I'm
[1:54:49] saying is strange language because this
[1:54:51] world knows nothing of that kind of that
[1:54:55] kind of thing but because Jacob and he
[1:54:58] knew that he knew that the promise of
[1:54:59] God was from Abraham Isaac and Jacob it
[1:55:02] re it was irrelevant that he had become
[1:55:06] the most powerful man on earth
[1:55:08] &gt;&gt; under Pharaoh most powerful
[1:55:10] &gt;&gt; right
[1:55:12] &gt;&gt; but he humbled himself
[1:55:18] You may not understand my words, but
[1:55:20] that's exactly
[1:55:22] that was in Jesus Christ.
[1:55:25] &gt;&gt; Jesus Christ could have spoke one word
[1:55:27] and caused the men that were tormenting
[1:55:29] him to vanish. And you listen to the
[1:55:32] message. You You listen to You listen to
[1:55:35] the tapes, friends. That exact spirit
[1:55:38] &gt;&gt; was in Brother Brenham.
[1:55:40] &gt;&gt; That exact spirit. And he would sit
[1:55:42] there and come to a platform, come to a
[1:55:45] pulpit and and give such high regard to
[1:55:48] brethren who were opposing him,
[1:55:51] &gt;&gt; men who were in opposition to him. And
[1:55:53] he give such high regard to them,
[1:55:55] knowing knowing that in the next few
[1:55:57] minutes he was going to exercise
[1:56:00] something that no man on earth could do.
[1:56:03] Amen.
[1:56:07] &gt;&gt; Now, if you knew
[1:56:09] &gt;&gt; you're going to stand the next few
[1:56:11] moments and do something not only that
[1:56:14] these behind him couldn't do and neither
[1:56:17] of those in front of him could do or the
[1:56:19] president could not do or no king could
[1:56:22] do, no man on earth could do. And in the
[1:56:25] next few moments, you're going to
[1:56:27] exercise something divine. How did he
[1:56:29] know it? Because he had a supernatural
[1:56:31] contact. Amen.
[1:56:35] &gt;&gt; One that he could say, "I didn't do it.
[1:56:38] &gt;&gt; I couldn't help it.
[1:56:40] &gt;&gt; I have no control over this."
[1:56:42] &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham says to me, Brother
[1:56:44] Eddie, he says, "The people think I have
[1:56:46] visions." He said, "It's not me. It's
[1:56:48] their faith
[1:56:49] &gt;&gt; that brings the vision on." And he says,
[1:56:52] "And when the vision comes, I can't stop
[1:56:55] it.
[1:56:56] &gt;&gt; And when it's over, I can't bring it
[1:56:59] back again." My brother, my sister, what
[1:57:02] kind of a message do we have? I'm trying
[1:57:04] to say to you today, it's been confirmed
[1:57:07] like no other message ever on earth
[1:57:10] ever. Ever.
[1:57:13] Then no message confirmed such as the
[1:57:15] message you believe. If there is, you're
[1:57:17] under obligation to show it to me.
[1:57:21] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[1:57:22] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:57:24] &gt;&gt; Glory to God. Amen.
[1:57:26] &gt;&gt; And man shall live not by word alone,
[1:57:28] but by not by bread alone, but by every
[1:57:30] word that proceedth out of the mouth of
[1:57:33] God.
[1:57:34] &gt;&gt; Satan is well able to take some choice
[1:57:37] phrases, choice selected out of the very
[1:57:41] message you believe because he he knows
[1:57:43] that's what you believe. And so if he
[1:57:46] wants to if he wants to try to uh turn
[1:57:49] you aside or get you derailed or get you
[1:57:51] off, he'll use the message you believe.
[1:57:53] He'll get just certain selected things
[1:57:55] and and and try to uh in in his attempt
[1:58:00] to oppose you, try to derail you or get
[1:58:02] you off of your main focus. But you we
[1:58:05] need to stand by every word that God has
[1:58:08] spoken.
[1:58:10] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:58:11] &gt;&gt; And to me to me that is
[1:58:15] that is a fighting a good fight.
[1:58:20] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:58:21] &gt;&gt; That's fighting a good fight. when you
[1:58:24] have the opportunity
[1:58:26] uh given the opportunity as Joseph was
[1:58:29] given but he didn't succumb to that he
[1:58:32] didn't give into it when I see it the
[1:58:35] generation that we're in
[1:58:39] and the opportunities that are presented
[1:58:41] to this generation
[1:58:45] it's a very important thing for us to
[1:58:46] keep our focus
[1:58:48] &gt;&gt; on the spiritual thing the supernatural
[1:58:51] thing
[1:58:52] &gt;&gt; that God has done for us in your life.
[1:58:55] Amen.
[1:58:57] Let's just have prayer. Heavenly Father,
[1:59:03] all your word is for eternally settled
[1:59:06] in heaven. And how I thank you for it. I
[1:59:10] thank you, oh God, that you are the one
[1:59:14] who has initiated it. You're the one who
[1:59:17] brought it to us. There was no way for
[1:59:18] us even to imagine
[1:59:22] that you would do these things in our
[1:59:24] time. I think, oh God,
[1:59:28] uh when I first begin to hear of these
[1:59:32] glorious things, it was so strange to
[1:59:35] our ears. And yet there was a witness of
[1:59:38] the Holy Spirit within us. How true and
[1:59:42] how blessed. And the word of God just
[1:59:44] became such a living book to us. Oh, we
[1:59:47] bless your name, Lord. We bless your
[1:59:50] name. And today, I pray that you'll be
[1:59:52] honored in the hearts of the people. I
[1:59:55] pray that you'll be lifted up, oh God.
[1:59:57] And may the people be instructed in all
[2:00:00] truth. And I pray, Father, that we'll be
[2:00:02] instructed in the whole counsel of the
[2:00:06] word of God. As the Apostle Paul spake,
[2:00:09] that he had not he had not hindered or
[2:00:12] he had not uh shunned to declare the
[2:00:15] whole council. Your messenger did not
[2:00:17] shun to declare the whole council. And
[2:00:20] we we just take it, Lord, and soak it in
[2:00:23] and saturate ourselves with it. We thank
[2:00:26] you, Father, for this word that you have
[2:00:29] given us. And we want to give you glory
[2:00:32] by a lived out life in Jesus Christ's
[2:00:35] name. Amen.
[2:00:38] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. I want to uh I want to
[2:00:42] sing that song.
[2:00:46] We bless your name. We bless your name.
[2:00:49] I had the number here, but I just Would
[2:00:52] you like to stand with me while we sing
[2:00:54] this
[2:00:55] big 2520 in the book?
[2:00:58] [Music]

[2:02:32] Heat.
[2:02:42] Yeah. Heat.
[2:02:48] [Music]
[2:02:54] Yeah.
[2:02:57] Heat.
[2:03:08] You
[2:03:17] are
[2:03:21] the truth.
[2:03:26] I bless your name.
[2:03:30] I bless your name.
[2:03:35] Open my eyes.
[2:03:42] [Music]
[2:03:50] in your mind.
[2:03:54] We
[2:03:55] pray
[2:04:03] and they will.
[2:04:08] [Music]
[2:04:10] Yes, they will.
[2:04:12] I
[2:04:17] bless your name. Hallelujah.
[2:04:21] [Music]
[2:04:30] You are
[2:04:35] the truth.
[2:04:39] I bless your name.
[2:04:44] I bless your name.
[2:04:47] [Music]
[2:04:48] Now before we
[2:04:50] sing the chorus once more too
[2:04:55] this pattern that I just
[2:04:57] closed out the message on here I am. I
[2:05:01] find it in Abraham.
[2:05:05] &gt;&gt; He'd say here I am.
[2:05:07] &gt;&gt; Here am I.
[2:05:09] I find it in Isaiah.
[2:05:11] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:05:13] in the sixth chapter when he saw the
[2:05:16] condition
[2:05:18] and then condition of the people he was
[2:05:20] in.
[2:05:22] Here am I
[2:05:25] use me.
[2:05:27] I see it in Samuel
[2:05:30] as a boy 12.
[2:05:33] He kept saying he kept thinking it was
[2:05:34] Eli but see the spirit the attitude
[2:05:37] didn't change whether it was Eli or the
[2:05:40] Lord. He just kept saying, "Here am I.
[2:05:42] Here am I." And Eli said, he realized it
[2:05:45] was God. He said, "If he speaks again,
[2:05:47] just say your servant heareth."
[2:05:50] That attitude. I see it in Jesus.
[2:05:54] He didn't say those exact words. But
[2:05:56] when he was in Gethsemane, that's really
[2:05:58] what he said.
[2:06:00] &gt;&gt; Here am I. Whatever it is, whatever your
[2:06:03] purpose is, my brothers, my sisters, my
[2:06:07] precious, precious friends,
[2:06:12] that attitude will always be victorious.
[2:06:18] [Music]
[2:06:20] &gt;&gt; Number one, don't forget it. Number one,
[2:06:23] acknowledge.
[2:06:25] Never let anyone take it out from you.
[2:06:28] Acknowledge the supernatural thing that
[2:06:31] God has done and deposited in you. You
[2:06:34] can't change that. There's nothing you
[2:06:36] can do about that. God has done it. You
[2:06:40] might say, "What is it, Brother Biscll?"
[2:06:42] Do you have a believing heart that
[2:06:44] didn't come from this world? That came
[2:06:45] from God. You had a revelation of this
[2:06:48] word when it just a flash went on
[2:06:50] inside. You saw it. I believe that.
[2:06:53] That's a supernatural part of God. You
[2:06:56] can never take that out. Hold that that
[2:06:59] supernatural thing. And now say, I give
[2:07:03] myself to that supernatural
[2:07:06] element.
[2:07:08] As I said a moment ago, take the
[2:07:12] supernatural element out of all of the
[2:07:14] message that you people believe. Take
[2:07:16] the supernatural element out and we
[2:07:18] don't have anything but a bunch of
[2:07:20] words. Amen.
[2:07:21] &gt;&gt; You'll have the same number of books and
[2:07:23] the same number of tapes, but it's just
[2:07:25] a lot of doctrine and different opinions
[2:07:29] and whatever more on the scripture. You
[2:07:31] understand what I mean? If you take the
[2:07:32] supernatural element out, but when you
[2:07:35] have the supernatural element and say
[2:07:37] God has spoken,
[2:07:39] &gt;&gt; that's thus saith the Lord.
[2:07:44] &gt;&gt; Friends, I don't want any man's idea. I
[2:07:46] want thus saith the Lord. That's right.
[2:07:50] &gt;&gt; When you know you have that,
[2:07:53] &gt;&gt; then you put all your confidence in that
[2:07:55] and say, "I know I have that. Things are
[2:07:58] going good. Here I am.
[2:08:00] &gt;&gt; Things are going better. Here I am.
[2:08:03] &gt;&gt; Things took a turn for the worse. Here I
[2:08:05] am.
[2:08:06] &gt;&gt; My my health has been taken from me.
[2:08:09] Here I am.
[2:08:10] &gt;&gt; My friends leave me. Here I am. Whatever
[2:08:13] happens, here I am. Here I am. Here I
[2:08:16] am." That is the attitude that God
[2:08:19] loves.
[2:08:23] &gt;&gt; Amen. And I want to send you from this
[2:08:26] place
[2:08:28] with that phrase on your lips. Here I
[2:08:31] am. I want to bless you Lord with my
[2:08:33] life. God bless you each one. God bless
[2:08:37] you. I trust you have been fed this
[2:08:39] morning. And if you'll come early
[2:08:41] tonight, our brother Dio, I don't know
[2:08:43] what's on his heart, but one one service
[2:08:46] really isn't enough.
[2:08:49] I would have given him this morning's
[2:08:50] service, but I wanted to speak to you
[2:08:51] since I came back from China.
[2:08:54] I bless your name.
[2:08:59] I bless your name.
[2:09:04] I give you
[2:09:07] honor. give you praise.
[2:09:12] You are the life
[2:09:17] through the way.
[2:09:21] I bless your name.
[2:09:26] I bless your name.
[2:09:30] We bless your name.
[2:09:35] We bless your name.
[2:09:38] Oh, thank you, Lord.
[2:09:41] We give you honor. Give you praise.
[2:09:48] You are the life,
[2:09:52] the truth, the way.

[2:10:06] Brother Tom, would you close in prayer,
[2:10:08] please?
[2:10:12] [Music]
[2:10:15] &gt;&gt; Father, we're
[2:10:17] so thankful for the moving of God upon
[2:10:19] the word of God this morning.
[2:10:22] [Music]
[2:10:24] Lord Paul had it all in his heart and he
[2:10:26] said, "I was a Pharisee of the
[2:10:28] Pharisees."
[2:10:30] But when that supernatural element came
[2:10:33] by, struck him off his horse. Lord, the
[2:10:37] first thing he said, "Lord, here am I.
[2:10:40] Whatever you have me to do, I'm willing
[2:10:41] to go." Lord, we had a seed within our
[2:10:44] soul. But when that supernatural element
[2:10:46] came, there's something in our heart
[2:10:48] says, "Lord, use me. Direct me. Anoint
[2:10:52] me. Father, here am I this morning under
[2:10:55] the sound of your gospel." We say, "Use
[2:10:58] us as a body. Direct your children.
[2:11:01] Anoint us for service." Lord, let that
[2:11:03] word have its way within our lives.
[2:11:06] Father, we're thankful for what we've
[2:11:08] heard. And we pray, Lord, that the word
[2:11:09] will keep on stirring us. Lord, Joseph,
[2:11:12] Lord, was under that anointing. He
[2:11:14] couldn't help it. And Lord, we can say
[2:11:16] this morning, we can't help it. Lord,
[2:11:18] our eyes are looking to you. And we're
[2:11:20] just desiring more of God within our
[2:11:22] lives. Anoint us, use us, go with your
[2:11:26] people again, we pray. And Father, as
[2:11:28] brother Deoku would come this evening,
[2:11:31] stir us again. Lord, we know Lord, this
[2:11:34] is the hour, the catching away. And Lord
[2:11:37] Jesus, we just want to be prepared and
[2:11:39] ready, not knowing what tomorrow holds,
[2:11:41] but you're the God that holds tomorrow.
[2:11:44] So Lord, would you bring a word into due
[2:11:47] season for us this evening? Father,
[2:11:50] anointing both speaker and hearer that
[2:11:53] you after it all would be glorified. We
[2:11:56] pray. Go with us now in Jesus name.
[2:11:59] Amen. Amen.
[2:12:05] God bless you.
[2:12:07] Like to keep this sweet atmosphere
[2:12:11] as you leave, as you shake hands with
[2:12:13] one another and get a little rest and
[2:12:16] refreshment this afternoon. And we'll
[2:12:18] see you this evening, Lord willing. God
[2:12:21] bless you. You're dismissed.
[2:12:25] All the light.
