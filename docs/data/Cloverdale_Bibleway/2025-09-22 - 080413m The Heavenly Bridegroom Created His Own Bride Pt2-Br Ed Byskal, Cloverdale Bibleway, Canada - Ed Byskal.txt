Brother Brandham said, "Let the great Holy Spirit that come down on the mountain the other day up there. I pray that it'll saturate every heart in here &gt;&gt; with his goodness and mercy, with understanding. We realize, Father, that that's what we need is to understand. For if we do not know what we're doing, then how do we know how to do it? But we must have understanding. As Daniel said, he had understanding by the prophet Jeremiah's writing. Father, we have understanding by the Holy Spirit's writing. He's revealed it to us in this hour. Give it to us, Lord. The desires that we have for thee. Is that your desire this morning? Amen. I'm thankful for the understanding what's going on in this earth that the Lord's given us. Amen. And if you don't understand what's going on, you can. Amen. We may not understand what happens to us day by day, but we've got someone whose thoughts are above our thoughts. Whose ways are above our ways. Amen. Whose ways are past finding out. Amen. All we want to do is walk in those bloodstained footprints. Amen. Let's sing the third verse together. Well, I don't know. I found you. Well, it may bring me poverty.

So, you can come up, get ready. If you don't know, we're all in trouble. Um, I've got an announcement this morning. Uh our uh uh brother Curtis and sister Melissa Walman are happy to announce the safe arrival of their son Kingston Edgar Walman. Boy, that's a big handle. Born on April the 10th at 9:59 p.m. weighing 7 lb 7 oz and 19 and a quarter inches long for you statisticians. So, we're thankful that mother and baby are doing well. Um, an announcement regarding uh lost and found. All lost and found items from the winter camp and recent church functions will removed by next Monday, April 14th. So, today's your day. Even if you don't know, you're look, you know, you're missing something, check it out. Uh, there's a bunch of Bibles. I don't know how you can lose a Bible and not realize it, but maybe you've got lots at home. Uh, but anyways, all the Bibles are going to get sent to the Philippines, so someone will receive your Bible and wonder who your who this person is. His name's at the front of the Bible. Anyways, please check take a moment to check the tables in the fellowship hall. And uh going forward, all lost and found items will be removed on the first Monday of every month. Okay, which is really difficult I guess if you lost it the day before, but um also uh there's going to be an iPod information session on Thursday, April 17th, 7 o'clock in the evening. So if you don't know what an iPod is or you've seen them but don't know what they do or how to get things onto the iPod or maybe get things off and put something new on, then you want to be there.

Signup sheets are on the bulletin board at the back. God bless you. He lets me walk down roads of disappointment. [Music] He watches and he knows what's best for me. The more I try, the better. He can mold me and change my life completely that it can fit his perfect way. That's just his way of telling me he loves me. It's a love beyond all human understanding. [Music] And I won't question trials that bring me to my knees. That's just his way of telling me he loves me. When I'm successful walking through this valley, he'll give me strength to climb the highest hill. My greatest strength comes through my darkest trials. [Music] And my greatest joy is knowing that he can trust in me. That's just his way of telling me he loves me. It's a love beyond all human understanding. And I won't question trials that bring me to my knees. That's just his way of telling me he loves me. That's just his way of telling me he loves me. It's a love beyond all human understanding. And I won't question trials that bring me to my knees. That's just his way of telling me he loves me. &gt;&gt; He loves you. &gt;&gt; Praise God. &gt;&gt; We're going to turn to the word at this time. And as brother Ed comes, let's turn on the screen to number 1053. Um, what key is this in? G. Okay. So, you can put on the screen afterwards so we know what key it's in. Man, so if you know it, you can sing it along with me. Amen. This road isn't easy all the time. Amen. But I'm thankful he's there with us every step of the way. Amen. Sing it. So many times I've questioned certain circumstances, things I could not understand. [Music] Anytime trials, weakness blurs my vision and my frustration gets so out of hand. Instead, I am reminded that I've never been forsaken and I've never had to stand one test alone. As I look at all the trials, the spirit rises up in me and it's through the fire my weakness is made strong. [Music] He never promised that would not get heavy and he would not be hard to he [Music] without [Music] standing in the valley and the adversary will He will take you through the fire again. I know within myself that I will surely perish. But if I trust my hand of God, his shield fl [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] and he would not be hard. Well, he never [Music] Just show and he will take you through the fire again. He never promised that the cross would not be and he would not be [Music] will never our victory The mighty will always [Applause] [Music] show up willing. He will take you through the fire again. [Music] &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Well, we're glad for that promise &gt;&gt; and we're standing firm. &gt;&gt; He's the one we can hold on, but he's the one that's holding on to us. &gt;&gt; That's what's important. while you're standing and with the words of that course in our in our hearts and in our mouth and I trust in our soul as well. Uh we are remembering a young lady that was baptized here just about 3 weeks ago. Uh Sister Megan Williamson. And Megan uh is Silas's Silus O'Brien's girlfriend. And uh they really uh there's much that could be said about that. But um in fact is just a short time ago some time ago brother Silas I'll I'll go this far to say he felt that he wanted to so separate himself uh to to a relationship with Christ and he decided to just withdraw from uh the boyfriend girlfriend relationship which he and Megan were having and were experiencing and so it was something very very personal and I uh I I'm so hesitant to make as much very much public but he just felt to uh separate himself to his relationship with Christ and all of that you know through the days of the last month that we have spoken here in the congregation. And so when I said to you that he had taken steps, this was one of the major steps. And then uh he just felt that until God would supernaturally reveal himself to her and that she would feel within her own heart, not because of him, but because of her own God's dealing with her. And that's what happened about three weeks ago. She just decided that whatever went on in her heart, but she just said, "I'm going to go to the waters of baptism and and begin my life with Christ." But prior to that, she had been coming here to the church faithfully on her own, not with any not with any ulterior motive that that uh we were at all aware of, just on her own coming without support of uh other friends etc. except the young people who she knew. But she came here steady to the meetings for quite some time and then decided to be baptized. Megan was struck down with an aneurysm yesterday and uh was taken uh unconscious to uh the uh St. Joseph's Hospital and uh the family uh gathered there her father and he may be here this morning. uh brother Murray Williamson uh the mother was there and uh brother and sister O'Brien because she's been like a daughter to uh brother Roger and sister Michelle and so we began to pray of course and many were praying and she's been transferred now as of this morning to uh uh to the Vancouver General Hospital. I will just say this that uh she was in a very very critical condition. Uh but a nurse yesterday was uh last night I believe was changing the sheets and uh was with her and asked Megan open your eyes. And at this time you have to understand they've already performed a a a brain surgery just to determine exactly what their condition was. and uh and they have an induced coma. But they asked asked her to open her eyes and she opened her eyes. Then the nurse asked her, "Megan, if you can hear me, squeeze my hand." And she squeezed the nurse's hand. And then she said, "Can you wiggle your toes on both feet to see that both sides of the body were functioning?" And she wiggled her toes on both feet. And in that state, we are thankful. What I have prayed, I'd just like to let you know what I've been praying. I asked initially for God to cauterize the leak of that blood vessel. And uh so they are planning to do surgery, some surgery today. And uh we just want we want to bear her up. And I think of uh the the the paragraph, my wife loves it. Not that I don't, but she loves it as one she came across where brother Brandham simply said, "We bring her into your presence by prayer." &gt;&gt; I want you to think about that. &gt;&gt; That puts the onus on us and the privilege on us. We have that wonderful privilege to bring her into his presence. by prayer. &gt;&gt; So when we're praying now, I want you to be thinking of that every single person. I'm I'm uniting my heart in this one purpose to bring her into your presence by prayer. And he also has said in his presence, the supernatural is happening. &gt;&gt; You believe that, don't you? Amen. Says this is not an emotion. And this is a promise. Amen. So, we're wanting to just hold up now and bring our sister Megan. I said to her, "Father, I said she raised I watched her raise out of the waters of baptism with such a radiant face." And he said, "Mr. Episcopal. He said, "Megan has been a different girl since she's been coming to your church." Now, that is a that's the that's the kind of testimony you want to hear. Lifech changing, nature changing, reality changing God. Amen. So, we're just going to have prayer now. Oh loving heavenly father, you have invited us to come to come freely to make our petitions and our needs known before you. You have come oh God and told us to come and to bring not only our needs and our petitions but to bring our desires before you. And father today as this entire congregation and the invisible congregation that is not within this building but they are with us hearttoheart attribute to attribute. Their thoughts oh God have now blended with ours. This entire body of believers, this this part of the body bride of Jesus Christ is coming before you knowing, oh God, that you so loved that you gave your own son. You so loved us that you led him to Calvary. You so loved us, oh God, that you gave him as a sacrifice. And father, the blood of Jesus Christ cleanses us and by his stripes we are healed. We're bringing Megan Williamson, oh God. We're bearing her before you on our prayers, oh God, lifting her up before you, Father, while a surgeons and medical team do everything in their power. But we have been told by your messenger, you just begin where man ends his ability. Where man is finished, oh God, that's just where you're starting. Oh God, I pray that you'll take charge and and bring this entire need. Oh God, this physical need under your supreme control. And we know great physician that you are the greatest of all. The great physician that can cause bones that are deformed to become straight. You cause, oh God, the maimed and those with short legs to be lengthened. You do the supernatural. You can remove a bad thing and you can create, oh God, a new thing. I pray that you will just bring the whole circulatory system into its order, oh God, into its designed order, Father, and raise the girl that was raised up, oh God, out of these waters of baptism, let her rise, Father, to the glory of the name of Jesus Christ. And may may the testimony, Lord, of this message, I pray, be made just your name made great. Oh God, you're the only one that's worthy of praise. And so we thank you for that. And Father, as we're going to be coming now to the word, I pray that you will give us understanding. Lord, I pray you'll give us quiet spirits, reverent spirits. Father, may we just be in wrapped attention, dear Lord. Pray that you'll take, Father, these lips of clay and use them for your glory as an instrument. and may the word fall into good ground. I ask in Jesus Christ's name. Amen. Amen. Amen. I'd like you to join with me and sing in the presence of Jehovah. In the presence of Jehovah. That's where we are, friends. And if you don't sense that presence, just ask him, Lord, let it envelop me and draw me in. Make my heart ready now for your word and for your holy spirit in Jesus name. Would you help us brother Roberty? [Music] [Music] Praise the [Music] trance [Applause] [Music] [Music] the [Music] Amen. With that melody on our lips, I'd like you to turn to the word. I appreciate the body of Christ in a very special way. Uh I I may take this evening service as well. I'm going to see how far we get along this morning. Brother John has so graciously and I never asked a person to do this, but I asked him if he could be prepared in case I, you know, just don't feel led. He said, "You go right on." I said, "I'll be ready even if you just announce it during the service." So, here I am. He's my backup today. Thank you, brother John. He said, "Just to be relaxed." And I do. I feel very very relaxed and at peace about it. But we just want to see how far some of these subjects, you know, uh are things that have been pondered and things that God has dealt with a minister perhaps for years and then things more come more common and it it gets fit together and then during those years young people turn from 10 years old to 20, you know, and what they grasped at 10 isn't what they're grasping at 15 and 18 and 20. Now we have young men and young ladies amongst us and need to hear some of these things that maybe you that have been here many years have heard before but now we want to hear it in a certain context. Last Sunday I spoke on the heavenly bridegroom created his own bride and I'm going to take part two of that. But the the title of the message does does not directly indicate the subject matter. uh only as we get into the subject matter can you see how it kind of begins to fit together. And that's why I say I may have to take this evening service. I I'm planning on doing so. So you just pray that God will give us strength. So I'm not going to carry a long long uh service this morning if I take this evening service as well. I'll have you turn with me to two readings. We're going to read Isaiah 9 and verses 6 and 7. And then we'll be reading in Hebrews the 3 chapter. All right. In he in Isaiah 9, for unto us, verse six, unto us a child is born, unto us a son is given, and the government shall be upon his shoulders, upon his shoulder. and his name shall be called wonderful counselor, the mighty God, the everlasting father, the prince of peace. Of the increase of his government and peace there shall be no end. uh upon the throne of David and upon his kingdom to order it and to establish it with judgment and with justice. From hence even forever the zeal of the Lord of hosts will perform this. In Hebrews the 3 chapter, "Wherefore, holy brethren, partakers of the heavenly calling, consider the apostle and high priest of our profession, Jesus Christ, Christ Jesus, who was faithful to him that appointed him, as also Moses was faithful in all his house. For this man was counted worthy of more glory than Moses, in as much as he who hath built the house hath more honor than the house. For every house is builded by some man, but he that built all things is God. Amen. &gt;&gt; God bless you. You may be seated. Now, whoever has the slides on in front of me, they can please take it off. It's distracting. They're trying to tell me I forgot something, but I didn't. They just don't know. I had already looked after it. [Laughter] Amen. For unto us a child is born, and unto us a son is given, and the government shall be upon his shoulder. Now I want to speak uh considerable time this morning on uh on the subject of of of the government said now the title of the message is that God the heavenly bridegroom created his own bride and that's exactly right. Uh but as and I went last Sunday I I paged my way through the Old Testament saying God was making his son. He was making you remember that God was making a son. Then into the New Testament, God was making his bride, his wife now for that son. But when the when when the son came, the son was under uh he was under a certain administration that was there present. He there was the laws of the the Jewish order. There was the laws of Rome. Uh there were certain taxes to be paid and that's even when he was born they had to go where they went because taxes there was a certain administration in place and they were subject to that and Jesus grew up under that administration and there were certain regulations and things that continued. They had the Passover at a certain time. They kept their certain celebrations and and various things. And Jesus, he he lived live lived subject to those things. And so now the bride of Jesus Christ, well, let me just back up a moment and say although Jesus lived subject to the laws of the land, he was not a lawb breakaker. But bey be beyond that and there was another kingdom. There was another realm which he was subject to and it is the realm of of it was the realm of God. It was the realm of the supernatural. Brother Brandham said he lived in a world of his own and he was subject to that. I mean when he was being led and directed, he must needs go to Samaria or he must needs go to a certain place because he must needs me to certain person that was not directed by Rome or by Judaism. That was being directed by another kingdom, another realm. And so the bride of Jesus Christ, we live in, we've been brought to this particular time and moment in time. And we come from different countries. We come from different backgrounds. And the nations that or the country that you came from originally and are presently living in, they have their own uh they have their own set of laws, their constitution. Uh they have their regulations. Then if you live in a certain city or a town or a village or a municipality wherever you live there are certain requirements which are made upon the citizens and we must abide by we are called upon to abide by those. So we get the point. But now within these governments and within uh within this natural realm there are men and people men and are individuals who are either elected or appointed to administer the what the governing body or the government decides is important and what they what their party plan is. They have been ordained. They've been ordained to come and do this thing and to administer it to the to the people. And so that I want to talk about this administration now. Uh have you you've got that point? That's that's important for me. Now and also one blends into the other. uh there is a it it's not like uh one age or one period just cuts off at we say well at a certain point in time midnight tonight this one is over and the next one comes into being uh even when governments change there's a period when uh there's an overlapping and uh the new government or the new party with their new uh platform with their main program they have to come but they just can't start it like that and the other one just can't end like that one has to blend into the other and so it is also in the scripture of the seven church ages and brother Brandham talks about it how they are they overlap one age into the other and so I would like to just uh let allow me to read uh just a wee bit which gives a uh I think a real good clear understanding of that because it's a it's a critical point in this in the service this morning said in order to understand the wealth of meaning involved in behold I set before you an open door and no man can shut it. That's the the scripture spoken to the Philadelphiaian church age. He said we must now recall what has been said about each age running over into another age. there is an overlapping or a melting or fading into rather than an abrupt end and a clear start. I want you to listen very very closely to this because I want to make a statement when we're when we're done done reading this paragraph. He said, "This age particularly flows into the next age." And not only does this age overflow into the last age, but the last age is in many respects simply a carrying on of the sixth age. And the seventh age, a very short age, that's the Leodysian age. A very short age gathers up into itself for one quick work all the evil of every age and all the reality of Pentecost. &gt;&gt; Once the Philadelphiaian age was about to run its course, the Leodysian age quickly comes in bringing both the tears and the wheat to harvest. And so now once again we have a duplicity uh a dual happening here. We have uh we have the evil as I was preaching last Sunday that the one is uh one the the the whole body or the whole movement of evil is increasing into a state of disorder. And in the midst of the disorder, in the midst of that disorder, God is bringing to his uh final conclusion and he's bringing an order to the body of believers. He's building a bride, a body of Jesus Christ. In the midst of evil, he's bringing purity. In the midst of disorder, he's bringing order. in the midst of evil and all every unclean thing. He's bringing forth not only purity but holiness until he will say that she's a church without spot or wrinkle or any such thing. &gt;&gt; Isn't that the promise of God? &gt;&gt; But the same word of God says that the things in the world will wax worse and worse. &gt;&gt; Is that so? &gt;&gt; Do you see that happening? And so then I will say that we have we have a a a a duel happening right now. You are living in it. You contact it every day. And that is a world system. Remember this is according to the scripture Satan's Eden. &gt;&gt; And Satan's Eden cannot be a an order of righteousness. It's an order of unrighteousness. &gt;&gt; It's something that is coming into disorder. If these are the days which are prophesied to be the days of Sodom and the days of Noah. In the days of Noah, the earth was filled with violence. That does not sound like order to me. &gt;&gt; That sounds like utter disorder. &gt;&gt; That sounds like chaos to me. That sounds like darkness and confusion to me. And we are not a part of that darkness and confusion. We are coming into the order. And the only thing that can bring divine order is a divine spoken word of God. &gt;&gt; There's no other way to come to order. &gt;&gt; And so that is the state. And now what we have, if you are listening real closely, I personally believe this world is being fitted for not only destruction but tribulation. And I believe that the elements of tribulation are set in motion now. &gt;&gt; And that is why, not to be negative, I'm a very optimistic person. &gt;&gt; But in the midst of this world is being fitted for destruction, being fitted for judgment, being fitted for, and the fact is it's moving in to it. It's in the it's in the beginning stages of the tribulation. &gt;&gt; In fact is if God withdraws as he has said he would withdraws his holy spirit withdraws his righteous or the exodus people his elected or appointed ones withdraws them from this world you'll see the you'll see the mess that Satan has created. &gt;&gt; And I say we don't want to see that. We don't want to be a part of it. I don't want to be here to view it. Amen. Right. &gt;&gt; And so while that is happening, I believe also the elements of the millennium &gt;&gt; are in place. &gt;&gt; Like the elements of evil, so are the elements of righteousness going side by side. The kingdom of this world and the kingdom of God. The tribulation on its way in and the millennium on its way in also. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And the prince of peace shall surely rule. The government is on his shoulder. That's the government I want to speak about &gt;&gt; because in every government in every government there are those appointed ones who are ordained or appointed or elected even in the world and we're are familiar with those terms and I'm trying to use terms that you are familiar with to bring it into the spiritual uh scenario because within the spiritual realm within the natural realm we have those that are elected and appointed. In the spiritual realm, we have those that are elected and appointed. &gt;&gt; And the Bible says, now you can go back and see how these how these ser services are tying together. What might we do that we can do the works of God? Jesus said, "Believe on him &gt;&gt; whom God hath sent." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Is the work of God. if you believe on him because it's not man who has elected a certain man or a certain person or a certain people or a certain party to be in control. It is now God says I'll do it. &gt;&gt; I'll do the choosing. Thank you very much. &gt;&gt; I'll choose whoever I wish. &gt;&gt; I'll choose a man that perhaps you don't think is prepared for the job, but I will endow him. I will endow those people. You may not feel that you're capable to carry the testimony that God has uh has has ordained us to carry, but I can assure you God does not give us a task to fulfill without giving us the power and the authority &gt;&gt; and the necessary equipment to fulfill the job. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. And so to believe on him whom God hath sent, the authorities of this land, we have and a very specific departments. And I'm going to speak a great deal about the offices. We have the department of finance. We have the department of defense. We have the department of of of of parks and and uh uh you know those those things that control the the environment. We have all different departments. We have the department of fisheries, the department of lands and forests. We have the department of natural resources &gt;&gt; and the and and the department of justice. Now, if you have a financial matter, it is just fruitless to go and say, "But I want to intreat the Department of Justice on this financial matter." I said, "You're in the wrong department." Or, "I've got a problem with the with the income tax department. I want to talk to a Supreme Court judge or I want to talk to the lands of, you know, the parks and the forest to say, "You're in the wrong department. We deal with trees. We don't know anything about income tax." Amen. &gt;&gt; You getting my point? &gt;&gt; And God has appointed, he has elected that there will be prophets and apostles &gt;&gt; and they shall be the foundation and that you can't do anything about it. That happens to be the department and the offices that control those things. &gt;&gt; And God has pastors and he has evangelists. He has teachers. He has apostles. He has prophets. He has all of these. He's put them into place. He had a Moses. And believe it or not, Moses was not just for the Jews and the Hebrews that lived at that time. The words that God spoke through Moses have run through have run through the ages and have power and are effective even today. And that has been upon billions and billions and billions of people. And you say, you mean that one man, one man has uh is going to have an effect upon billions of people? That's God's choosing. That's God's doing. &gt;&gt; And then we might bring it down and say, "Are you trying to infer that there's a handful of people that have believed on him who God sent and in this end time that there's a small group of people that's called the bride of Jesus Christ and that she has a certain status above any other uh who even uh who even have some testimony or some claim on the cross or claim of Easter or claim of the resurrection that happens to be the truth of God's word. &gt;&gt; Amen. God chooses whoever they are. I don't know who they all are, &gt;&gt; but God knows every single one of them. And I can tell you one thing. How do you identify them as opposed to anyone else? They have to believe on him whom God have sent. &gt;&gt; Now tell me that that pillar of fire that was with William Brandoms of the devil. &gt;&gt; Now tell me, come forward and tell me that that was not of God. Tell me when he stood there and said that you come from a certain place. You don't come from this city. You come I see you traveling from the east coming west and you have a you you are going to see your daughter and in fact there's a letter from hers in your purse. Tell me that's of the devil. That's not of the devil. &gt;&gt; That's God. How does that happen time and time and time and again? So then I asked the question that's that's not like Pentecost called oh some little gift or something. That has nothing to do with the gift. This is a special endowment to identify him whom God has sent. God is trying to tell a blind world, open your eyes. &gt;&gt; And now I ask another question. What kind of administration? What is that to administrate? What is the administration? What what is that? What kind of effect is that to have? What is it to do? Primarily, it's to bring you to be a believer of the word. to believe the word in its fullness and in its strength &gt;&gt; and to believe on him whom God has sent. &gt;&gt; I believe that God sent you. That's just how how much I believe it. &gt;&gt; I believe that God has sent you to a specific place maybe where you work &gt;&gt; or where you live or where you shop. Maybe even do you know that administration is in effect today? Right while you're sitting here, the government is in an effective administration. Do you know that there are people working on your behalf? It's not just that there are laws. It's not just that. There are benefits. &gt;&gt; There's wonderful benefits. &gt;&gt; Do you know that we have a certain freedom? We're sitting here in a perfect freedom. You could go into some countries where they have a law in place and they have the people administrating it and they have the they have the police and whoever else they if if you try to have this kind of gathering in some places I know they shut you down real quick &gt;&gt; because they don't only have the law in place they have the people to affect it. &gt;&gt; But here in this country we happen to have the freedom. We can gather like this and that we just take it for granted because this is where we live and we have people that protect us. And I'm happy for that freedom. &gt;&gt; Aren't you? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I'm happy that I can say, "Praise the Lord." I'm happy I can go out on the street and cry my lungs out if I want to. Thank God &gt;&gt; and nobody can stop me &gt;&gt; cuz we're in a free land. Express yourself. [Applause] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; That's just the kind of place it is. But in the spiritual realm, because we're not just in the natural, in the spiritual realm, I'd like to make the congregation more conscious because we're a very materially and materialistic generation and age. I think we need to be more conscious of the invisible, of the other dimension, of the other realm. And that is why I'm intrigued. I'm not only intrigued, I'm very keenly interested. I have been impacted. My life has been changed when I met the prophet of God and saw and heard said now that's the angel of the Lord. &gt;&gt; That is the Lord Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; That is the Holy Spirit. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I tell you what, I had an awe. I was impacted from a young man and I'm more impacted today &gt;&gt; than I was then &gt;&gt; because now I realize this this one this one that was in another realm. Well, he would say, "Can you see that?" I couldn't see that. But I knew that it was true because he said, "Now it's it's over a man. It's over this woman." And this is exactly why you're here. To think that the compassionate high priest in another realm is administrating the power of another kingdom upon the people, us poor people. Oh, and so find that sinners come and waited down with sin and heard him speak the other day. Now you're the thing that is troubling you is you're not a Christian. You're holding a baby, said a young woman. You're holding a baby and you want the baby, but he says the big thing is you're not saved. You're not a Christian. Oh, administration coming from another realm, from an invisible realm, coming and meeting these poor individuals are here, lost and not knowing which way to go, solving our solution, answering our questions. That same Holy Spirit is present right now. Yeah. &gt;&gt; But for us to think that just some kind of loosey goosey and anybody has access, there's nothing in the Bible that says that. &gt;&gt; You might say, "Well, whosoever will may come." That's right. Come. &gt;&gt; Come God's way. &gt;&gt; Come believe on God's plan. &gt;&gt; Come and believe God's program. And you do have access to it. Right? &gt;&gt; People don't like that. But that happens to be. I tell you what, you know, you go and build a house here in Siri or build a house in your district and and and and then when you want to hook onto the water, just say, "Oh, no, no, no, no, no. I'm living in a free country. I want a pipeline direct to the reservoir. I want my own line. I don't want to hook up to this system that you got in place. I don't believe in this system. I don't believe in any system. I want my own line. &gt;&gt; You know what'll happen to you? Your faucet will be dry. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You won't have any water. &gt;&gt; Because you're either going to come with the with the the system of the city and that happens to be what's in place. Well, God happens to have a system in place, friends. &gt;&gt; He has apostles and prophets who's the foundation of the church and it's built upon them and there's nothing else you can do about it. Well, here I am preaching and I haven't even started. Now I want to talk about the body. The bride of Jesus Christ. The church of God is called a number of things. It's called the bride of Christ. It's called the body of Christ. It's called a holy nation. Now, when we think of the body of Christ, we think of a church. And it can be that. It's also called a spotless church. &gt;&gt; It's called the new Jerusalem. &gt;&gt; It's called a holy nation. &gt;&gt; It's called the habitation of God. And all of those have reference direct reference to us as a group. &gt;&gt; So on one hand we can see ourselves as a collective body. On another hand we can see ourselves as an individual within that body and nothing really changes. The body in a corporate manner is called a bride of Jesus Christ. It is also called a masterpiece. But you as an individual must be a masterpiece within that corporate body. Because if you are not a masterpiece, then the whole body can't be a masterpiece. Each individual must be a masterpiece. &gt;&gt; And this is something if we could get to unity on this one point, it would make a great effect, a great change in the atmosphere. It would make a great change in the answer to our prayers if we had every person every person identified down the roads of this congregation and and every single person within the sound of my voice could say with a truth and a w with a a confirmation and assurance within their heart by the grace of God by the work of God by his sovereign work in my life I am a masterpiece of his handiwork. &gt;&gt; See, even even the amen was weak. &gt;&gt; See, that's where it gets if we if we always say, "Oh, the body of Jesus Christ, worldwide, wonderful body." People say, "Amen." Then we say within a congregation, within a church, and it's a body of Jesus Christ, bloodbought, spotless, without any any wrinkle or any such thing. Say amen. And now we want to bring it home. &gt;&gt; Say, what about you as an individual? &gt;&gt; Say, well, I can say amen for somebody else. I could say amen for the world and amen for a whole church, but I have a tough time saying amen for me. See even that is a downer. &gt;&gt; See how negative we are. &gt;&gt; It's not saying that you have achieved some great thing. It's saying that he has achieved it. &gt;&gt; We say we are a masterpiece because Jesus first paid for it. &gt;&gt; He bought it. And if we if we cringe from that, if we diminish from that, then we take away from the effect of his sacrifice at Calvary. We're saying, well, it was a great sacrifice, but how somehow not sufficient enough to make me a masterpiece. &gt;&gt; The bride of Jesus Christ is a masterpiece. She's a glorious church without spot or wrinkle. She is the new Jerusalem with the light of the lamb in her. &gt;&gt; That's what this book says. &gt;&gt; And now we want to agree with what it says. &gt;&gt; And you want to repeat the same thing. You want to say what it says. It is a glorious church. I'm part of that church. I'm part of the glorious church without spot or wrinkle or any such thing. That's what this book says. &gt;&gt; Amen. every person right away, we tend to look at our frailties or our failures and whatever more. And I'm not trying to get your uh not not trying to get you to deny that, but I'm trying to get you to agree with the word of God and let God look after the frailty. &gt;&gt; You you've got to look after my frailty. You have to look after If you don't do it, it can't happen. &gt;&gt; I can't do it on my own. And if I did it on my own, what glory would that get him? Say, "Send the Holy Spirit." If you need a cleansing, just call on him and believe him to do the cleansing right now. You need some molding. You need some transforming power in your life. You can't generate it. Just say, "God, you come and do it." Amen. &gt;&gt; Sometime people wait for years, months or years to be baptized because they want to get themselves in a state of perfection before they're baptized. Forget it. &gt;&gt; Even if you could get yourself to a state, who says God's going to accept that? &gt;&gt; So, well, I did it. I quit. Not saying that we shouldn't have that resolve, but if you mean business with God, if you really mean business with God, I can tell you God's got the system in place &gt;&gt; to bring upon and bring effective in your life everything that we have need of. &gt;&gt; Do you believe that? &gt;&gt; This is a wonderful government. &gt;&gt; The government's on his shoulder. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. It's a government that's increasing. Amen. &gt;&gt; It's a government increasing in its order. &gt;&gt; It's increasing in its peace. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And this is the house that Christ built. &gt;&gt; And it says this, Ephesians, in whom ye also are builded together. I wonder if we can say amen to that. In whom ye &gt;&gt; in whom you &gt;&gt; Yes, me. Yes, &gt;&gt; you believe that &gt;&gt; in whom I &gt;&gt; am builded together &gt;&gt; for inhabitation of God &gt;&gt; through the spirit. Would you agree with this? Apostle Paul's writing &gt;&gt; 100%. I'm trying to get total agreement here. &gt;&gt; See, I don't need your excitement. I need your agreement. &gt;&gt; I just want you to say yay and amen to the word. Amen. &gt;&gt; And then he goes on in the Corinthians, he says, "What know ye not that your body is a temple of the Holy Ghost which is in you which you have of God and you are not your own?" These are powerful. &gt;&gt; Your temple always saying, "Ah, I know that I'm a temple and so on so forth." I want you to re I want you to experience it. I want you to express it. I want you to especially confess it. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; If you're here and may you may well be here that are not filled with this Holy Spirit. And remember the Holy Spirit will never deny the word that he's the author of &gt;&gt; never. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And your body is the temple of the Holy Ghost which you have in you which is in you which you have of God and you are not your own. Amen. &gt;&gt; And then 1 Corinthians 3:9, for we are laborers together with God. &gt;&gt; So we're all laborers together, &gt;&gt; not just a ministry. We are laborers together. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I didn't witness to Megan. I never had an opportunity to witness to her, but somebody ministered to her. &gt;&gt; She was at youth camp. &gt;&gt; Brother Burley Williams ministered to her. I'm sure the O'Brien family has ministered to her. Somebody witnessed to her. &gt;&gt; I thank God for that witness. [Music] &gt;&gt; I thank God I'm in support of. There's a lot of people that are here who've come to the new birth that I didn't witness to or maybe didn't hear a sermon that I or anybody else preached behind this pulpit, but somebody spoke to them. Somebody handed them a book. Somebody handed them maybe a tape or whatever more. &gt;&gt; And a lot of you young people are here because you've heard through your parents, dedicated parents guiding. What a wonderful thing. And you've heard it again and again. It's it's it's incumbent upon you to to this morning to receive this message that that is not just my parent or my friend or someone I know or my associate or somebody I'm working with that happens to be part of this mechanism called the administration of the Holy Spirit that is being effective from an unseen realm and coming down into the visible realm and having effect in moving someone to speak out of their mouth words of life. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And it's important to realize in fact as I I come here to the pulpit this morning I would have sooner been maybe someplace just having my feet up. But I I I feel I am I'm a duty bound. And furthermore, I'm not going to cower or back away from what I really believe. I believe I'm commissioned to be here tomorrow morning this morning and to say these very things. &gt;&gt; I didn't have everything all set up and planned. I just say, "God, you take order of the things. I feel this in my heart. I feel the burden of the word of the Lord. You put it together in a structure. You say to the people what needs to be said. I don't know who all is out there. I don't know who all is listening, but you know exactly who's listening and exactly what they need to hear. It's up to you to pick up that nugget. &gt;&gt; It's up to you to pick up that thing that God has for you. I can guarantee it will be here in this service because God is not a God of accidents. This isn't just some great gathering of happens. You're here by divine by divine order of God. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; I believe that. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So, you are God's building. We're laborers together. And you are God's husbandry. 1 Corinthians 3:9. And you are God's building. &gt;&gt; Like this congregation to say, "I am God's building." &gt;&gt; We say it together. I am God's building. Now, that has a two-fold meaning. Doesn't just mean I am God's house, but I am the I am the result of God's work. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Both of those things. &gt;&gt; And if God has been building you, then he intends to own you and inhabit you. &gt;&gt; So, I am God's building. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And especially I want to dwell on now I am the consequence. I am the result of God's handiwork. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I am God's handiwork. I couldn't save myself. I couldn't cleanse myself. I couldn't rid myself of old habits. I couldn't rid myself of of of uncristlike nature and character &gt;&gt; and desires. I am God's building because God has done the work. Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And it works. &gt;&gt; We are God's building. &gt;&gt; How long should I say that? Well, brother Vandom said, "Say it till you believe it. &gt;&gt; I am God's building." &gt;&gt; Right in the middle of your failure, say, "I am God's building." When something rises up within you, say that's not that's not what I should be thinking, say, "I am God's building." &gt;&gt; Oh, Holy Spirit, come and make an effect upon me. I am God's building. &gt;&gt; So we are both we are both a masterpiece of his work and also a dwelling place for him. In the masterpiece message, God the great sculptor has made him a masterpiece. For it is a piece of his first masterpiece like he made in the Garden of Eden. He took a piece from and made another piece and that was marred and felled. Now he's been Now he's been all this time building it up again. and he brought forth this masterpiece and was smitten in order uh that part that part that was smitten was in order to bring back again that masterpiece again. &gt;&gt; Talking about the Eve that came from Adam. If Adam was a masterpiece and God who could make no error took her from him, I ask was she a masterpiece? &gt;&gt; She was. Amen. &gt;&gt; Says there never was. Prophet said never was a woman like her. &gt;&gt; She's magnificent masterpiece. And how they two must have strolled through Eden until the serpent came along and promised her more light and she believed it. We don't want to get on into that. But he said further, "So the masterpiece and the son of God, the masterpiece and the bride, the masterpiece, Jesus Christ and the bride, he said, and it's a piece of him, &gt;&gt; which must be the fulfilling of the word." If it's a piece of him, if he was the fulfilling of the word, what about his wife's part? &gt;&gt; She's a fulfilling of the word. Amen. &gt;&gt; You need to say that I am a fulfilling of the word. &gt;&gt; That is my part. I am a fulfilling of the word. My husband, masterpiece, fulfilled the word. I am a part of him. &gt;&gt; Word of his word, spirit of his spirit, bone of his bone, flesh of his flesh, word of his word. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Here we are. Regardless of what you what kind of week you had, I can say because the word of God says we have his spirit. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Being born again, not of corruptible things, but of incorruptible by the word of God. &gt;&gt; We're birthed by the word of God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We need to keep preaching it. &gt;&gt; We need to keep saying it and you need to keep confessing it. Let us where we have victory over all the powers of darkness, but it's by your confession. &gt;&gt; So God is like a great contractor. Brother Brandham said in building this masterpiece, God has many trades. &gt;&gt; We won't talk now about materials because he talks about the 16 elements. But I wanted to just digress from that. I want to talk about the administration. He's got many trades. You see some of these highrises and these skyscrapers that are downtown especially. I want you just to think for a moment uh what trades, what skilled people. I've sat on 747 jets. You know, my mind works in very childish ways. I sit there in that big jet and I think like the little woman who first saw the first train threw her apron up in there and said, "It'll never go. It'll never go." And when the train got chugging about 20 miles down the down the track, she threw her apron up again and said, "It'll never stop. It'll never stop." I I've been on some of these planes when they loaded them with so many people and I sit there and I watch all those carts of all the suitcases and tons and tons and then the freight coming in. Yeah. &gt;&gt; I said, "This thing's never going to get off the ground. &gt;&gt; I just know it." And then in my perhaps juvenile thought, I look at the rivets in the wings. Yeah. &gt;&gt; And when I look at those rivets and I see how this plane is put together, I get very very humbled when I realize before before this was ever a piece of aluminum or metal in a in a in Boeing's plant in Seattle. Before that, some guy sat at a drawing board and dreamed up this wing. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; And dreamed up where every rivet's supposed to go. And he has to draw he has to draw it where everyone is. These are going to be x space apart. I hope you don't think this is too childish, but he thinks that it's got to be exactly so many, you know, millimeters or whatever they work on. And every rivet has to go into place. And that's what I think about. I think about before before this thing even came into being, somebody dreamed it up on a piece of paper. &gt;&gt; What a plan. And then the thing roars down the down the runway and actually takes off. &gt;&gt; Well, I'm glad somebody drew a right kind of plan. &gt;&gt; But there happens to be another plan. &gt;&gt; And God put it on paper first. &gt;&gt; Before it became flesh, it was word &gt;&gt; and he put it on paper. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And the word became flesh &gt;&gt; and dwelt among us. &gt;&gt; And he was a masterpiece. &gt;&gt; You talk about flying. He didn't need any rivets. &gt;&gt; He didn't need any wings. &gt;&gt; He ran up to Bethany and blessed them and departed. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. I like what brother Brandham says. Oh, they talk about astronauts in this age. We've had astronauts for centuries. Enoch was an astronaut. &gt;&gt; Elijah was an astronaut. Jesus was an astronaut. And there's a bunch of them sitting here today. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Who shall be changed. We shall not all sleep, but we shall be changed. That's what the scripture says. We shall be changed in a moment, in the twinkling of an eye, before you even bat your eye for a next blink. It could happen. &gt;&gt; You'll be changed. And the prophet of God says the atoms of this body will be transformed. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; That's the kind of administration I want to be under. Amen. &gt;&gt; Now, brother Brandon made just a comment. He said, he said, "You could pour gallons of oil or whatever term." He said, "You could pour oil all over a person's head, cast out every devil you can dream of or think of, that devil will sit right there &gt;&gt; unless you know exactly." How will you know? By the discernment of the Holy Spirit and by the plan that God has put in place. Hallelujah. There's a certain order. God has a certain order. You can't ignore the order and expect the results. &gt;&gt; You can't ignore God's man and get the results. &gt;&gt; You try to ignore the things that God has laid down in this message. &gt;&gt; And you think, and you could lay it down, say, "Well, you know, it doesn't really mean it. Says 30 miles an hour out here, but it doesn't really mean it. I'll go 50." Yeah. Well, you may get away with it for a while. And I've had people deny the message, walk right away once, but they've even said to me, "Yeah, nothing happened to me." Oh, we're not talking about whether it happened today. I see them speeding here in front of the school and they they they just go by. They could say when they go through, "No, nothing happened to me." H don't put that fear thing on me. But then one day you run into the policeman. &gt;&gt; He's there. &gt;&gt; Then something happens. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; For every house, the scripture says Hebrews 1 3 and 4, for every house is builded by some man, &gt;&gt; and he that built all things is God. right? &gt;&gt; We can only imagine the multitude of skilled people that are taken to build even some of these things that we see around us. Now listen closely to this paragraph. Why are we in the condition that we're in? He's speaking to the whole church. Why are we in the condition that we're in? We could say Christendom or full gospel people. He says or we can even say believers of this message. He says there it is. If a contractor and he goes back now the same way that I'm making references today. If a contractor laid out a plan for his men to build a house such and such a way. Each man ignored the blueprint &gt;&gt; and they built the house according to the way that they thought each man should build it. What kind of a looking house would it be? &gt;&gt; So now you are a house &gt;&gt; in part of this whole it could be corporate and it can be individual. You are part of this house and how you take and how you receive what's been laid out. We talk about a message. I can I can prove to you by God's vindication that that was God's administrator for this age. Amen. &gt;&gt; That's God's administration for this age, meeting out what is needful for this age. &gt;&gt; So, well, we ignore it. We ignore the warnings or we say, "Well, you know, I I I think maybe that was just kind of Brother Brandham's own thought." Mhm. Okay, fine. Or I think that's just the pastor's, you know, I think that's his idea. You know, I I'm going to say something here. This is this is you maybe, you know, I might make more enemies than friends, but I believe that if a person comes to the right office and the right attitude and asks with sincerity for a question that even if they got the wrong answer, God would honor their process. &gt;&gt; God would honor them &gt;&gt; and make it turn out right. See, God has his program. God has and it can be in such simplicity. I mean, you know, who was going to take who was going to take brother Brennham's uh who's going to take his advice? Yes. For healing or for something that they had need of. I hope you're staying with me. But who's going to take his advice and counsel on how the doctrine of the church should be and what should be taught and so on and so forth. To me, it's a paradox. How do you say this is right? This was all truth, but over here it's all wrong. &gt;&gt; Hello. You know, I'm just trying to be very very pragmatic. I'm just trying to be very Listen, we're not talking about, you know, having a better life and having a little better social structure outside. We're talking about eternal life. Amen. &gt;&gt; So these are things that I want you to really ponder and think about. So we have all these different trades. We're we're looking towards building uh a school building here in the corner of the property. And we've got the architects and those who have skill in drawing. But think of the trades. Think of the electricians. I've looked at blueprints. They don't mean anything to me. It's just a whole lot of it's a confusion. &gt;&gt; But a man who's trained in it, he knows what he's looking at. I have questions come up almost every week from people and they say, "Uh, I don't understand this." I got one I got a text from my daughter last night and she says, "Did you speak one time about standing in the water and out of the water? The earth standing in the water and out of the water." She said, "I'm reading it right now in in St. Peter's epistle. I'm reading it and it seems to me you spoke on it sometime." And I said, "Yes, it's in Genesis. It was the earth standing in the water and out of the water in the beginning of the creation. And then we came to where Jesus who the prophet said was the first part of the earth that God took in his redemptive plan. That body of Jesus Christ was the first part of the earth that he was going to redeem and it went and stood in the water and was out of the water and the dove came down said this is my son. Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And then in this day, here come the messenger that was to reveal him in his second coming standing in the water. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; The one that would receive the word of God. &gt;&gt; Some of you getting it. &gt;&gt; Sen. She sends me a text back. That's so enlightening. I'm glad a person can have even, you know, a daughter that can appreciate that. &gt;&gt; And every house is builded by some man, but he that built all things is God. &gt;&gt; That was Hebrews 3 and 4. And we can only only imagine just for a moment. I'm not going to be much longer now because I want to I want to carry on tonight, the Lord willing. And I just going to give you a little tidbit of where we'll be going tonight. But you can just imagine all the different I look around in this congregation. I see all the different ones that God uses here and use there. And and you just couldn't do without them. The body of Christ, this little unit of the body of Christ here, we just couldn't work without it. to the sisters that take care of, you know, you have a a funeral or you have a reception or you have something and and it's a part of the ministry. You need to you need to be able to have that. And if people look after it and they look after the music or they look after another part or they look after the people and I think of the deacons and I think of the trustees and they go way beyond and there's people that aren't trustees and aren't deacons that give all kinds of time and people that help one another and people that I heard someone was in need and their home was in need and and some brothers got together and went and and fixed the thing and looked at that that to me is ministry. That's all part of it. And something we hear about and a lot we don't hear about. It takes all of that. And no one person's going to do all that. No one can begin to do all that. And I think where the message goes and where God has intended it for it to go, it can only be a working organism, a working body that that achieves this. &gt;&gt; And one can't do it from, you know, uh- within themselves. And anybody who thinks they can do it all just cannot a big mistake. But he says, "A contractor lays out his plan for his men to build. If each one ignored the blueprint and they built the house according to the way they thought each man would build it, what kind of a a looking house would it be?" &gt;&gt; So now we have the foundation of the apostles and the prophets, Jesus Christ himself being the chief cornerstone. you know, just as a just as a phrase, Jesus Christ himself, and there's songs about it, Jesus being the chief cornerstone. I don't know what people think about, but and if Jesus is the builder of the house and you are the house, he has to be the chief cornerstone &gt;&gt; in your life. And if he happens to be this and if he has made this has revealed this through the prophet's message then if we ignore that chief cornerstone you're not going to be built upon it. &gt;&gt; Let me go on. &gt;&gt; He promised that the chief cornerstone shall we say or Christ they said unto us a son is born. It's going right back to the beginning. Unto us a child is born. Unto us a son is given. And the government shall be upon his shoulder. Those are just nice phrases, but you need to really get into the message to see what what that the government shall be upon his shoulder. And I'll perhaps read it later on or maybe tonight, but it goes back to the old wedding ceremony. Oh my, I wish you could tie this together because when it would be wedding time, &gt;&gt; our day, then it would be made known what that language even means. And the scripture says also through the prophet Isaiah, that the that the that the key of David, the key of David would be upon his shoulder. Now, you got to really concentrate for a moment. The key of David, not the key of Moses or of Elijah or someone else, but the key of David, the key of kingship would be upon his shoulder. And the whole scenario, the whole picture that's being described, Brother Brandham takes it and says it's the ancient wedding ceremony that is being depicted here in a beautiful way. So now remember the wedding ceremony is at the at a time it's king and king is identified in the scripture as a lion the lion of the tribe of Judah and so now and here that same scripture comes back over into the book of revelation that the key of David is upon his shoulder and the wedding ceremony was that the veil and sometime we have it in wedding ceremonies here. And perhaps you don't fully understand what it is. It may just look like it's a nice thing to do. And and the wedding ceremony was that the bride will take her veil off from herself and drape it and lay it over her groom's shoulder. He said, and I'll read it perhaps tonight, identifying, indicating that she is surrendering her entire being. She's surrendering all of her rights. She's surrendering all that she is to him. Now to put it in other language to that the bride of Jesus Christ who has been called and elected in this time because this is bride time. You've never heard so much about bride as you hear it in this message because it's a bride message &gt;&gt; and it happens to come at a certain season. This is not Luther's administration or Wesley's administration. And he said clearly, it's not Pentecost. &gt;&gt; Pentecost can never produce the bride of Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; Because she denies the word &gt;&gt; hangs on to trinitarian things. It's not in the Bible. &gt;&gt; She can never bring it. &gt;&gt; Do you support me? &gt;&gt; It's a bride message. And it has to be the time when the bridegroom is coming into his kingship. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Remembering the overlapping &gt;&gt; of the age. &gt;&gt; He's son of man, prophet &gt;&gt; on earth. I've got to come to it just a wee bit and give you a little teaser for tonight. Son of man was his identification as prophet on earth during his earthly visit. And the Bible tells us that and Jesus referred to it. He spoke it himself that they were determined to make him king. &gt;&gt; And he knew that this was not his kingly time. &gt;&gt; And the people even tore off the branches just prior to crucifying him. Tore the branches. Are you with me? &gt;&gt; Tore the branches and and and waved them. Hosana in the highest. Blessed is he that cometh in the name of the Lord. And they wanted to make him king, &gt;&gt; but it wouldn't work &gt;&gt; because it was not the season. &gt;&gt; And so Jesus never administrated or administered. He never sent out his disciples to be representatives of his kingly role. &gt;&gt; He never said, "Now you go out. You're representatives of the king." &gt;&gt; No, he sent them out. preach the gospel, &gt;&gt; heal the sick, &gt;&gt; raise the dead, do all manner of these things. Why? Because it was part of his priesthood. &gt;&gt; And he told him, "Don't go till the Holy Spirit comes." Because it had to come under another administration. It can't come under this administration of prophet. It has to come under another administration. And the Bible says that after he died, he entered into the holiest of all. [Music] [Applause] into the holiest of all with his own blood. &gt;&gt; I thought the blood was shed and went to the ground. It did. But he had the he had the blood of his of his sacrifice and he entered into the holiest of all. Just think of it friends. The blood that cleansed you. &gt;&gt; The blood that is representing you today came before almighty God. where you and I we can't even imagine entering into that presence when the saraphims of the great creatures of of holiness come before him and and and say holy holy holy holy holy holy holy you talk about a holy presence but Christ came there on your behalf &gt;&gt; in that office as priest and entered into his high priestl entered into his priesthood &gt;&gt; and then came another administration. &gt;&gt; And so he said to the disciples, "Don't go tarry in Jerusalem until you're endued with power from on high. Another supernatural thing is going to come from another dimension and infuse your being. It's going to turn a coward Peter into a bold preacher of the gospel." Hallelujah. It's going to transform those men. It's going to turn James into a prayer warrior. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; This is a life-changing thing. &gt;&gt; I've been thinking some of you young people, don't you even dream of going on in the same way that you've gone on. This is this gospel is not about that. This gospel is a transformation. [Applause] Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; This isn't something just slip and slide along. &gt;&gt; It's a transforming gospel. &gt;&gt; If you mean business with God, he'll mean business with you. &gt;&gt; Jesus said, "Don't go till you're endued with power from on high." And those young men, &gt;&gt; they went out into the highways and byways and begin to deliver this gospel. It wasn't the message of the king. &gt;&gt; And it wasn't just a message of a prophet. It was the message of the priest. &gt;&gt; It was a message of uh uh intercession. It was a message of mercy. It was a message of healing. &gt;&gt; And so in the end time, &gt;&gt; oh my, help me now. In the end time, he had to introduce it because the priesthood is going to come to a cease. &gt;&gt; It's going to cease. &gt;&gt; And he had to come with that same ministry of Jesus Christ. Amen. &gt;&gt; It had to have the same characteristics had to come out of nowhere. &gt;&gt; And they even spoke about Jesus language, &gt;&gt; the language, the Galilean language, a gutal language, a plain simple language, the language of the poor. What did William Brandon preach? The language of the poor &gt;&gt; had to come with the same characteristics. But he came and his prayers were simple, &gt;&gt; the Lord Jesus Christ. But someone from another realm &gt;&gt; heard the prayer &gt;&gt; and a thing happened &gt;&gt; without a bunch of shouting. It happened. &gt;&gt; And here comes another messenger and he prays a simple prayer and the child crippled up begins to straighten out the same power, the same miracles because it's the same God. &gt;&gt; And now it's under another administration, the revealing of the son of man. But he has to come the same way &gt;&gt; with the supernatural attendance, with the phenomena. It has to come that way. &gt;&gt; But then as Jesus continued in his ministry, then he had to come with his message. &gt;&gt; His message. I and my father are one. &gt;&gt; Oh, I have it in my message. I wish I could take to you. When God took Eve from Adam, God didn't give her a big message. It was Adam that gave her a message. &gt;&gt; And the message that Adam gave her, you are bone of my bone. Told her where she come from. &gt;&gt; You're flesh of my flesh. &gt;&gt; And therefore shall a man leave father and mother &gt;&gt; and be joined to his wife. And he came and gave her a message of oneness. Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And the message of the messenger in this hour came exactly the same &gt;&gt; with a message of healing, restoration. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And redemption had to come. Then had to come the message of oneness. &gt;&gt; Total oneness. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Tell her. Had to tell the bride where you come from. had to tell the bride who you belong to. &gt;&gt; Had to tell the bride where you were going. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Glory. &gt;&gt; And it was necessary, absolutely essential that that messenger under his administration should now begin to introduce Melzdc &gt;&gt; as another high priest. Oh, I'd like to start preaching now on the administration of Melchazdc. [Applause] &gt;&gt; And you may not be aware of it, but that's that's the high priest order that we're under. &gt;&gt; You're not under Aaron. &gt;&gt; You're under Melzdc. &gt;&gt; And if you're not familiar with the name, you need to get familiar with the name. He's in charge. He became Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; And now Melzdc &gt;&gt; is king of Salem. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; And priest of the most high God &gt;&gt; that came to Abraham. &gt;&gt; And now in this generation, king of Salem, &gt;&gt; priest of the most high God, came to his messenger &gt;&gt; in the end time. And he came back there to show Abraham what his children what his seed would come to in their final end. &gt;&gt; And then when the children arrive, the children of the final end. &gt;&gt; He had to show them what kind of body. &gt;&gt; He had to reveal to them the kind of body they would come to. &gt;&gt; And that's in a different office. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We'll get into that tonight, Lord willing. &gt;&gt; It's wonderful. &gt;&gt; And that's why that's why your messenger had to come to you and say, and he only preached one message on it. preach it in the in the Hebrew series and Apostle Paul. You can read it before tonight. Read the seventh chapter of Hebrews. You can also read the fifth chapter. Apostle Paul who gave the doctrine of the to the early church. He says plenty about Melkisedc. You want to read it. And he also says to his people with everything that he said, there's much more that I need to say about this. But he said, "You're children right now and you're not able to bear it." So what is that saying? There has to be a there has to be a people come who can bear it. There has to be a people come who can hear it. &gt;&gt; And so now you have a messenger in end time come. Who is this? &gt;&gt; Melzdc. Not who was that &gt;&gt; or who will it be? He's saying who is this? Who is it? &gt;&gt; The high priest. &gt;&gt; After the order of Melzdc. &gt;&gt; How beautiful. &gt;&gt; I'll just give you two tidbits and then we'll close. What did Melzdc administer? Well, he administered bread and wine &gt;&gt; after the battle. &gt;&gt; You may think that you've got all kinds of struggles, &gt;&gt; but the messenger the messenger in this day, you have been recipients &gt;&gt; of sustaining bread &gt;&gt; and mana from above. And if it hasn't brought stimulation, you just haven't drunk from the right cup yet. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; We've received bread and wine. &gt;&gt; You said, "I thought this is going to be after." And the same prophet said, "The battle's over. &gt;&gt; The battle's finished. &gt;&gt; And the victory's won &gt;&gt; and the joy bells are already ringing." &gt;&gt; You might say, "Well, that's not in my world." Or you need to step into the next one. You need to step into the next kingdom. It's already over. It's already finished. &gt;&gt; I don't care what you face. &gt;&gt; It's already done. &gt;&gt; There is nothing. There's no weapon. &gt;&gt; There's no weapon formed that can prosper against a child of God. &gt;&gt; That's the scripture. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; That's the administration we're under. What a glorious thing. &gt;&gt; What a glorious thing. &gt;&gt; It's a glorious church without spot or wrinkle. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Brother Rod, I'll probably need to I don't have much of a voice to sing, but maybe you can help me. And you know where the brothers in the sound room were correct. I was to have a baby dedication. Actually, I was going to have two this morning. And I contacted the one parent. And I do have a valid excuse for forgetting things. Brother Raymond, I actually have a valid excuse. And I think you would probably agree with me. My wife is away. [Applause] We're going to dedicate brother Raymond and Sister Raisesa's child. You're going to help me, brother Raymond. You're the father. You're going to help me. And sistera and the grandparents are here from I believe Toronto or the east and also from the west. So east meets west right here. and Ree's parents are here. Brother Raymond's mother's here. And we're delighted. And hey, do you know what? We don't have any special program. &gt;&gt; We're going to give this baby a dedication. &gt;&gt; Amen. Let's just sing a little chorus, Brother Rod, while Brother Raymond and Sister Reissa come. [Music] I am so glad that our father in heaven tells of his love in the book he has wonderful things in the Bible I see. And this is the dearest that Jesus loves me. Oh, I am so glad that Jesus loves me. Jesus loves me. I know Jesus loves me. Oh, I so glad that Jesus loves me. Jesus loves me. Though I forget him and wander away, still he does love me wherever I stray. Back to his dear love. He [Music] Jesus loves me. I am so glad that Jesus loves me. Jesus loves me. Jesus loves me. I am so glad that Jesus loves me. Jesus loves me and I am so glad that Jesus loves me. Jesus loves me. Jesus loves me. I am so glad that Jesus loves me. Jesus loves me. &gt;&gt; Take that course again. &gt;&gt; I'm so glad that Jesus loves me. It's on. &gt;&gt; I am so glad that Jesus loves me. Jesus loves me. Jesus loves me. I am so glad that Jesus loves me. Jesus loves me. I am so glad that Jesus loves me. Jesus loves me. Jesus loves me. I am so glad that Jesus loves me. Jesus loves me. Sister Reissa's voice has blessed us all &gt;&gt; over and over again. &gt;&gt; And if I had a voice like that, I probably wouldn't even try to talk. I just sing my way through life. God bless you, Seresa. Now, where you're going to help me, Brother Raymond, has give me the names. This baby's carrying got some heavy names and you know what they mean. And I don't have the names with me in front of me. &gt;&gt; Uh, her name is Tea. &gt;&gt; Tea. &gt;&gt; Abigail. Zion. &gt;&gt; Abigail. Zion. &gt;&gt; Young. &gt;&gt; That's it. Tea means precious. Um, Abigail is the father's joy. And Zion. &gt;&gt; We've arrived. and tella Abigail Zion is just sleeping through the whole thing. &gt;&gt; You don't bother her a bit. She's not nervous. And the Bible says, "And the and the parents, the mothers and the fathers brought and the word is really wonderful because you're not just bringing her here in a ceremony, but they brought them to the word. They brought them to Christ. And that's not just a single event. You'll be bringing them, but they wanted her and their children to be blessed as you have brought her. And they brought young children to him that he would touch them. And his disciples rebuked them that brought them. But when Jesus saw it, he was much displeased. Something special in his heart for these gifts because he knows where they come from. &gt;&gt; Amen. And he said unto them, "Suffer the little children to come unto me, and forbid them not, for if such is the kingdom of God. For verily I say unto you, whosoever shall not receive the kingdom of God as a little child, he shall not enter therein." And he took them up in his arms, put his hands upon them, and blessed them. And that's what we're going to do. Taking this precious little one, Tea. I tell you what, she's a sweet bundle. I put my hands upon her. Dear Father, in the sacredness of this moment, I'm a poor substitute for Jesus Christ. But Lord Jesus, in this moment, I pray that you'll just take and indwell my body in such a way that our brother Raymond and sister Reisa and their loved ones that are here with them may know that God, creator of heavens and earth and giver of every good gift, blesses now this child in the name of Jesus Christ, the son of God. Father, I pray that you'll take this tea, Abigail, and Zion. Oh God, may your hand be upon her for good and not for evil. May these parents, Lord, bring her often into your presence and teach her the ways of God. I pray your blessing will be upon the home. I ask you'll bless this child with good health, oh God. Keep evil from her. keep sickness from her. And I pray that when her ears first hear and her mind and heart registers the name of Jesus Christ, may there be something special within her. May it be a special response. &gt;&gt; May there be a special love that are well up in her heart. And may she serve you in her youth and in her childhood. I pray that you will you will protect her and watch over her. And on that day, may she too stand there, I pray, robed, oh God, with the righteous. And I pray, Father, if if if time go on, allow her to sing like her parents sang. Give her a voice, oh God, like her mother. And may she sing praises to you. May she be an example to other young people. I pray in your name, I ask it now. And Lord, I dedicate her to you. I dedicate tea Abigail Zion in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; God bless you, brother Raymond. Amen. God bless you, Sister Teresa. Amen. God bless you. Isn't he lovely? Amen. Would you like to just stand and I want to thank the Lord for the day that he's given us and I trust you'll come back this evening. Lord willing. I want to I want to continue where we left off this morning. We started by singing in the presence of Jehovah, but I would like to sing He came to me. He came to me. You didn't go to him, but he came to you. I wonder if he came to you this morning. Did he make himself real to you this morning? God bless you. God bless you. pray for the service this evening and the service in Seattle this afternoon. Yes. Amen. He came to me. He came to me. I would not come to where he was. [Music] We thank you. [Music] I to where he was. He came to me. He came to me. He came to me [Music] to where he was he to as my [Music] cal [Music] to where he was. He came to me. [Music] &gt;&gt; I'd like to just say from my heart to your heart, thank you. God bless you for every prayer you've prayed for myself, for the meetings, for the ministry, for the bride of Christ. Thank you. God bless you. And I pray that God's richest blessings be upon you and that you'll go from victory to victory to victory. I believe in victory and the ultimate victory. And one day, please remember this as we close. We're going to be in another gathering &gt;&gt; by his grace. &gt;&gt; I want to be there more than anything in life. I think of it every day. I think of it every day. I think of it throughout the day. I want to be there. I want to be there. I don't feel worthy, but I just know that his grace will be sufficient. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I want to be there. I want to hear the singing of the redeemed. &gt;&gt; I want that overwhelming, overwhelming, consuming feeling that must come through a body that's beyond sin and sickness. that consume allconsuming realization. It's over. &gt;&gt; It's over. &gt;&gt; No temptation can come my way. No problem can come my way. It's all over. &gt;&gt; Oh, I hope that's a reality to you. &gt;&gt; We thank him for it and that's why he came to us. We'll bow now and be dismissed. Our dear father, this great great plan, this scheme of redemption, this thing that you have ordered, you have caused it to be effective upon the earth. From your throne and from your domain, you have from this invisible realm, this invisible kingdom. Yet you have pressed through into this realm. You have brought us as individuals, as humans. You've brought us under the impact and under the effects of the Holy Spirit of God. You have transcended the dimensions. You sent your messenger, oh God, and on a constant basis as a demonstration to the people of this day. Oh, I trust we can appreciate it what you have done, Lord, in all of the glorious reality. How he transcended, Lord, and and made the eternal realm so real and brought it so near to us. And now, Father, let that continue. I pray that when the word is preached that your children, your elected, your appointed ones will be elevated up, oh God, into heavenly places. You have not made that term in the Bible in the heavenly places in Christ Jesus as some idol phrase. You brought it so it could be a reality. May the young men and young women, oh God, the families and the couples, I pray and the seniors, Lord, and all who are listening to my voice, let them be carried up, oh God, on the wings, I pray, of faith into the heavenlies of Christ Jesus. Bless the service this afternoon in Seattle. Oh Lord, be with the people that gather there. And as we gather this evening here, I pray you'll help us in Jesus Christ's name, dismiss us now in your grace. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. God bless you. You're dismissed in Jesus name. Go get some refreshment and we'll see you this evening. Amen. Hallelujah. Heat. Heat. [Music] Heat. Heat. [Music] Glory [Music] to God. [Music] Thank you. [Music] Thank you. [Music] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. [Music] That's wonderful. [Music] [Music]
