there for this pool drinking what he wish to and Ravens the feeding then it comes a time when they begin to H want for Elijah and they went out to try to find this man of God now I want you to order

Tuesday night and Tuesday afternoon to pray for the rain listen close Elijah said first go call up 400 of them prophets go call your opposition and bring it up here and said when you get it up here said then let's cut a Bullock and two and you give them their chance and let them call on their God and then you give me a chance to call on my God and I want you to notice after they P went up into the heathens that cared over their religion and so forth it was it was dead there was nothing and Elijah walked out put his hands across his breast maybe this way and said why don't you call a little louder maybe he's pursuing maybe he's in battle why don't you speak to him yes sir now you have a beer party down here to start your Gat or have a big picnic somewhere and let the whole world turn into that and bring rain on the Earth are you let let's try that ton night you just open up every Salon give everybody all the drinks you can and make the Christians stay home and not pray and

call out to God and Watch What Happens that the god that answers be God that's still trial I've seen that triy of many times I said you get one of the persons un let bring the sick and Afflicted and find out who's God God will be the same thing in this if you people around this area here want an oldfashioned pouring down ring you just get down on your knees and all of you around and start calling out to God with a sincere heart burn up everything in your house take that beer bottles out of the ice box throw that deck of cards away take your children and take off to Sunday school next and stay

represented the tribes coming together then the sacrifice the Bullock was laid on top of the ston that's the blood of Jesus Christ covering all his children then he said now to be sure that's not false or anything about it everything God does is in above Bo he said now bring me seven barrels of water and it Pour the barrels of water up on top of the sacrifice and they made a trench and the water run all down around like that said you see there's no fire around it it's absolutely genuine churches together the sacrifice laying bleeding now Elijah walked out to Lord God I've done all this at your command let it be known today that thou God and I am thy Prophet about that time the power of God begin to fall begin to lick up the the sacrifice and all the water around tuck up the
