[1:48] A different sound.
[1:52] The sound of the city that John saw
[1:57] coming down.
[1:59] The sound of the bride being united with
[2:05] the groom.
[2:07] Yes, I keep listening.
[2:11] I keep listening. Oh, I keep listening
[2:18] for a different sound. I keep listening.
[2:24] But I keep listening for a different
[2:29] sound. It's the sound of the city that
[2:36] John saw coming down.
[2:39] The sound of the bride being united with
[2:45] the groom. Yes, I keep listening.
[2:51] I keep listening.
[2:55] I keep listening for a different sound.
[3:02] Amen. I'm glad there's a different sound
[3:04] to be listening for than what we hear in
[3:07] this world. Amen. number 594.
[3:10] Amen. You're happy to be here this
[3:12] morning. Want to greet each and every
[3:13] one of you. Name of our Lord Jesus. We
[3:15] have a very full wonderful day planned.
[3:18] We're just looking forward to a full day
[3:20] of the Lord's presence with us. Amen.
[3:22] Why don't we sing an old hymn on a hill
[3:24] far away stood an old rugged cross of
[3:27] communion this evening. Baptismal baby
[3:29] dedication. It's going to be a wonderful
[3:31] day. Amen. Let's sing the first verse.
[3:35] On a hill
[3:37] far away, there stood an old rugged
[3:43] cross,
[3:45] the emblem
[3:47] of suffering
[3:50] and shame.
[3:53] And I love
[3:56] that old cross
[3:59] where the dearest
[4:02] and best
[4:04] for a world of lost sinners
[4:08] was slain.
[4:13] Oh, I'll cherish
[4:15] the old rug
[4:18] cross
[4:22] till my cross
[4:25] at last night.
[4:29] I will sing.
[4:32] I will plead to the rocking
[4:37] cross
[4:41] and exchange it some faith for a crown.
[4:47] Second verse.
[4:50] Oh that old
[4:53] cross
[4:55] so despised
[4:57] by the world
[5:00] has a wonderous
[5:02] such action
[5:05] for me.
[5:08] Oh for the dear
[5:11] lamb of God. He left his glory
[5:16] above
[5:18] to bearish
[5:21] dark.
[5:22] [Music]
[5:27] Oh, so I'll cherish
[5:30] the old
[5:33] cross
[5:36] till my throne is at last.
[5:45] And I will clean
[5:48] the alling
[5:51] cross
[5:55] and extend it someday for a wrath in the
[6:02] old rugged cross.
[6:04] When the old
[6:06] ruged cross sty
[6:11] [Music]
[6:22] was on
[6:26] Jesus suffered
[6:30] and died
[6:32] to pardon
[6:34] and saved
[6:36] my me.
[6:40] So I'll cherish
[6:43] the old rug in cross
[6:49] until my face
[6:52] at last.
[6:58] And I will leave
[7:01] the all rocking
[7:04] cross
[7:08] and exchange it someday for a crown to
[7:15] the old rugged cross. Oh to the old
[7:19] rugged cross
[7:21] I will never
[7:24] be true.
[7:26] the shame
[7:28] and reflection.
[7:30] [Music]
[7:56] the old
[7:58] cross.
[8:02] Till my glory
[8:05] at last
[8:11] when I sing
[8:14] to the old
[8:17] rock
[8:21] and exchange it some
[8:26] [Music]
[8:30] hear the cry Eyes of the shackle
[8:35] from the onset
[8:38] time
[8:40] for the change
[8:42] of the
[8:44] no
[8:49] and see the tears
[8:51] of the broken,
[8:54] the cries
[8:56] of the slave.
[8:59] Is there no one?
[9:01] Sing that verse again. Hear the cries of
[9:04] the shackle.
[9:08] Hear the cries
[9:10] of the shadow.
[9:13] The onset
[9:15] of time.
[9:17] The chains of defeat. There's no peace
[9:26] and see the tears
[9:28] of the broken
[9:31] eyes
[9:33] are the slaves.

[9:38] worthy?

[11:59] Why don't we stand and sing the second
[12:01] verse again? Then the crying is all that
[12:05] must.

[20:17] Hallelujah. Blessed be your name, Lord.
[20:21] Amen. I'm going to ask our brother Tim
[20:22] Dodd if he would just come open the
[20:24] service for us in a word of prayer. We
[20:26] have a testimony. We want to give glory
[20:28] to God. We prayed for our brother Jorge
[20:30] Flores in Argentina who had a stroke. He
[20:33] is already in the process of healing and
[20:34] was even able to speak on the phone this
[20:36] past week. They want to thank us for our
[20:38] prayers and send greetings. Amen. We
[20:40] just pray for a complete healing for our
[20:42] brother Jorge. Brother Tom Freys asked
[20:45] that we'd remember his sister-in-law
[20:46] Helina Frey. Yesterday she asked for
[20:49] prayer. She has found out she has cancer
[20:50] for the second time and has given up
[20:52] hope. Even started smoking again. And we
[20:54] just ask that God would grant her
[20:56] salvation, deliverance from smoking and
[20:58] her healing. Amen. There's something on
[21:01] your heart that you just like to raise
[21:02] before the Lord as our brother Tim would
[21:04] come. Amen. Just let it be known with an
[21:06] upraised hand. Amen.
[21:09] Hallelujah.
[21:11] Amen. Let's pray.
[21:15] Heavenly Father,
[21:18] when has there been an age where a
[21:21] people could sing with all their hearts,
[21:23] "It's already done. The battle is over.
[21:26] The book has been redeemed. The lamb has
[21:29] claimed his bride. Or the people have
[21:32] responded to the call. Lord, we're
[21:35] rejoicing in what you've done. Lord,
[21:37] we're not looking forward or looking
[21:39] back. We're in the presence of the
[21:41] living God. Lord, we're living in your
[21:43] realities at this moment. And we know
[21:45] you're the same yesterday, today, and
[21:48] forever. Lord, your redemptive blessings
[21:51] are here this morning. We thank you for
[21:53] what you did for the brother in Chile.
[21:55] Lord, thank you for the touch. Lord, we
[21:57] know he's a wonderful brother and we
[21:59] just give you praise and honor and glory
[22:01] for the change that you did in his
[22:03] mortal body. In a moment of need, you
[22:05] came on the scene and provided. And
[22:08] Lord, there might be many this morning,
[22:09] oh God, that have the same need or a a
[22:12] need in their bodies. Lord, touch them
[22:14] even now, Lord. We pray as your word
[22:17] goes forth, may the virtue flow from
[22:19] your word into the lives as is necessary
[22:22] this morning. Whatever the need might
[22:24] be, it might not be physical. It might
[22:26] be financial. It might be spiritual. It
[22:29] might be emotional. Lord, there's
[22:30] different levels. But Lord, may you pour
[22:32] out your spirit to the meeting of each
[22:34] and every situation. We believe it. We
[22:37] claim it. And Lord, we remember this
[22:39] woman, oh God, from the Frey family in
[22:42] need, Lord, this morning.
[22:45] Lord, I I read the request.
[22:48] Father, I remember one day that there
[22:50] was a blind man called Bararddmus
[22:53] sitting by the side of the road and he
[22:55] be to cry out, "Oh, thou son of David,
[22:58] have mercy on me." Lord, this woman's
[23:01] not a believer. But Lord, we're crying
[23:03] out on her behalf. Oh, son of man, have
[23:06] mercy on her. Lord, reach down to where
[23:09] she is this morning. She's in need.
[23:12] Lord, have mercy on her. We pray. Maybe
[23:15] there be somebody this morning that
[23:17] feels that way in their own lives. Oh
[23:19] Lord, have mercy on me this morning.
[23:21] We're crying out to you and we believe
[23:23] as a predestinated seed touched your
[23:26] heart 2,000 years ago and stopped you
[23:28] and received a blessing. May your virtue
[23:32] be met to every need this morning. We
[23:34] pray.
[23:36] We're so thankful to have brother Ed
[23:38] back, brother Biscoll back with us,
[23:40] Lord. We thank you for him. We ask that
[23:43] you'll anoint him, strengthen him, use
[23:45] him this morning for our benefit. You
[23:48] know our hearts. You know our
[23:49] expectations, our needs. Bless him,
[23:51] Lord. We pray. Bless every exercise of
[23:54] this service. We ask in Jesus Christ's
[23:57] name.
[23:58] Amen.
[24:01] [Music]
[24:05] Amen. You turn out, shake hands. Another
[24:08] one of the redeemed. Say, "God bless
[24:10] you." You're welcome to have your seats.
[24:12] Once again, we want to greet each and
[24:13] everyone gathered here this morning.
[24:15] Those connected with us by way of the
[24:18] internet and the phone hookups, we just
[24:19] want to say God bless you. Amen. Our
[24:21] sister Victoria Andy, Sister Jessica
[24:23] Caldwell are going to come sing a song
[24:24] for us. Why don't they come and get
[24:26] ready? And as they're coming, why don't
[24:27] we sing Greater than all greater than
[24:30] all my sin.
[24:33] Oh, greater than all
[24:37] my sin is the blood that still cleanses
[24:45] me. Is the grace that still sets
[24:50] me free.
[24:53] Lord to praise him
[24:57] and I above
[25:03] I'm walking in
[25:07] this light and I cannot fall for it's
[25:13] greater than all. The love that I see it
[25:18] once more is greater than all.
[25:21] It's greater than all
[25:24] my sin. Is the blood that still cleanses
[25:31] me is the grace that still sets
[25:36] will set me free.
[25:39] full of graces
[25:44] and I know the blood
[25:48] of life. I'm walking in newness
[25:54] of life.
[25:56] I cannot fall for it's greater than all.
[26:01] The blood I will sing. I know the blood
[26:04] supply of life.
[26:06] Oh, and I know the light
[26:10] of life. I'm walking in goodness
[26:17] of life. And I cannot fall for it's
[26:22] greater than all the blood of the lamb.
[26:29] [Music]
[26:46] [Music]
[27:06] Lord, I'm trying to find the words to
[27:10] say.
[27:11] how much I really love you, Lord.
[27:15] And I'm trying to find the words to say
[27:20] how much I really care.
[27:24] But it seems like words are not enough
[27:28] to express this love. I feel
[27:32] you're wonderful.
[27:36] So wonderful,
[27:40] Lord. You're wonderful
[27:45] in every single way. More beautiful
[27:52] than words could ever say. Lord, I love

[28:04] wonderful.
[28:06] You're beautiful
[28:08] and I'm so in love
[28:12] with you.
[28:19] You were there for me when no one's
[28:22] there to comfort and protect me. And you
[28:27] gave me strength to keep resting on when
[28:31] all my strength is gone. You died for me
[28:36] upon the cross. You drive away my fears
[28:41] and doubts. What would I do
[28:46] without you?
[28:49] Lord, you're wonderful
[28:53] in every single way. More beautiful
[29:00] than words could ever say. Lord, I love
[29:06] you
[29:08] and all I want is more of you. You're
[29:11] wonderful.
[29:13] You're beautiful.
[29:15] And I'm so in love with you.
[29:32] When I see your grace and mercy and the
[29:36] love that you outore,
[29:39] I just can't help but love you, Lord,
[29:43] more and more. My desire is to please
[29:49] you in everything I do. Take all of me,

[33:15] because
[33:17] thou hast first
[33:21] love
[33:23] me
[33:26] and merces
[33:30] my Oh,
[33:37] [Music]
[33:42] I love
[33:46] your
[33:50] [Music]
[33:59] Heat. Heat.
[34:06] [Music]
[34:17] Amen.
[34:19] God bless you, brother Eugene. Brother
[34:22] Kenny,
[34:24] said Regina. God bless you.
[34:28] Well, we've added another one to the
[34:31] family of God.
[34:34] Amen.
[34:36] Um,
[34:38] brother Eugene and sister Gina have
[34:42] brought their son
[34:44] and uh to be uh not only dedicated but
[34:47] and I know they don't bring him to a man
[34:51] to a person or to a church but I know
[34:54] that they're doing this because it is in
[34:57] the scripture and they brought them to
[34:59] the Lord Jesus Christ and he and he said
[35:03] suffer the little children to come unto
[35:05] me and forbid them not.
[35:11] &gt;&gt; I asked brother Eugene in an email. I
[35:15] said, "Give me his names and give me why
[35:19] you called him these names." And I was
[35:23] touched by that, uh, Brother Eugene. And
[35:25] I'm going to say just a little bit about
[35:28] it.
[35:30] They've named their son first Paul
[35:34] being humble or small
[35:38] and he said uh the name Paul is after my
[35:41] grandfather
[35:43] who was a minister of a small
[35:44] Pentecostal church.
[35:47] As a little boy I knew him to be a
[35:49] perfect example
[35:51] of a Christian man. And even in time of
[35:55] communism, people respected him for his
[35:58] Christian stand.
[36:01] So the first I was affected by the fact
[36:04] that brother Eugene was influenced
[36:09] and affected
[36:12] as a little boy
[36:14] and your son will be a little boy
[36:18] in not too many years.
[36:21] The second name they called him Vladimir
[36:25] to rule with greatness.
[36:28] And he said, "The name Vladimir is after
[36:31] my father
[36:33] whom once again I noted I look up to
[36:37] as the best Christian that I know
[36:39] because I see his life, his everyday
[36:44] life and he lives for Christ."
[36:48] And the third name was after yourself
[36:52] if Guinea
[36:54] wellborn.
[36:56] If Guinea is after me as I try to be the
[37:01] best Christian that I can.
[37:04] And I want him to grow up to be a
[37:06] Christian no matter what he becomes in
[37:09] life as long as he is a Christian. And I
[37:13] took those three
[37:15] uh brother Eugene and I thought
[37:19] uh here's a a man and I'll come to you
[37:21] in a moment Jana but here's a a young
[37:24] man and he's naming his son and he
[37:28] thinks of what affected him when he was
[37:30] a boy
[37:32] then what is affecting him now as a man
[37:36] a young married man I respected my
[37:39] grandfather
[37:41] for his Christians stand even under
[37:44] difficulties and persecution
[37:46] and I respected my father. I respect him
[37:49] now. I see his everyday life and he's a
[37:53] Christian. My grandfather's a Christian.
[37:57] My father's a Christian and I seek to be
[38:02] influenced and live the kind of lives
[38:05] that they live. And so I say to you,
[38:08] Brother Eugene, keep the heritage going.
[38:12] Okay. Let it live on.
[38:14] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[38:15] &gt;&gt; If time should go on and this son should
[38:18] raise and be a young man and marry and
[38:21] have a child, may he be able to stand
[38:24] where you're standing
[38:25] &gt;&gt; and say, "And my father,
[38:28] left an example for me."
[38:31] &gt;&gt; The grandparents of these this child,
[38:35] both grandparents are believers.
[38:38] on Sister Gina's side and brother
[38:42] Eugene's side and we're so thankful for
[38:45] their godly lives.
[38:48] And I was thinking as a mother, Sister
[38:50] Gina,
[38:52] how you, the prophet said, you no doubt
[38:54] will hold your son's hand when he maybe
[38:58] takes his first step. And you will
[39:00] certainly be holding his hands and
[39:03] guiding him as he takes his first steps.
[39:06] But it won't end there.
[39:08] I want to ask you that you shall walk
[39:11] and both of you shall walk so he can see
[39:14] your footsteps and say, "I'm not ashamed
[39:17] of their footsteps. I'm not ashamed of
[39:20] the way they conducted their lives and
[39:22] and and teach him that the things you're
[39:26] bringing them here to the house of God
[39:27] to be dedicated. Bring them to the house
[39:30] of God." You don't even know when
[39:32] they're so small and such infants, yet
[39:34] they they come under the atmosphere.
[39:36] They feel the presence of God and
[39:39] they're moved by it. And then you need
[39:41] to go home and teach them what it is
[39:44] they felt and what that presence of God
[39:46] is like.
[39:49] And he said, "Your life," the prophet
[39:51] said, "your life will impress your
[39:54] children and have influence on your
[39:57] children by the example that you set
[40:00] before them." So may God direct you in
[40:03] such a way as my prayer. And my prayer
[40:06] is that, and I even type my prayer
[40:08] before I take your boy and pray for him,
[40:12] is that he will be molded
[40:14] by the presence of the Holy Spirit.
[40:18] and that the and that the preaching of
[40:20] the word in the house of God that his
[40:23] life will be molded by that and that you
[40:26] as his parents will teach him
[40:29] how to put into practice the godly
[40:32] things that he hears in the services.
[40:36] Amen. We're going to dedicate
[40:44] what shall I call him.
[40:50] Eugene Vladimir Paul. Paul.
[40:55] God bless Paul. Let's bow our heads.
[40:59] Heavenly Father, I hold this gem that
[41:01] you have dropped down and given to our
[41:04] sister Gina and brother Eugene, their
[41:07] first son. They've called him Paul. I
[41:10] pray in the name of Jesus Christ that
[41:12] there'll be just a part of the Apostle
[41:14] Paul that'll be upon him. I pray oh God
[41:18] that that inheritance and and
[41:20] characteristics of his grandfather and
[41:23] his father Lord Jesus will be imparted
[41:27] to him by the Holy Spirit. I dedicate
[41:32] him now to you in the name of the Lord
[41:35] Jesus Christ that Paul Vladimir
[41:40] will live for Christ and may his life be
[41:43] a testimony oh God for you. I pray, oh
[41:47] father, in the name of Jesus Christ,
[41:49] you'll keep him in good health and give
[41:51] him long life if our Lord Jesus shall
[41:54] continue and allow that. And I pray
[41:57] you'll bless sister Gina, father, as she
[41:59] holds him in the home, as she feeds him,
[42:02] as she directs his life. I pray, oh God,
[42:05] that you'll bless this couple. Bless
[42:07] them with divine wisdom in a very wicked
[42:09] generation. And may their light be a
[42:12] place of home, Father, and then in their
[42:14] home of light, oh God. And that light
[42:16] will prevail in their son's life. In the
[42:20] name of Jesus Christ, for the glory of
[42:23] God, I pray. Amen.
[42:26] Amen. God bless you, Sister Gina.
[42:33] Hallelujah.
[42:40] Praise God.
[42:43] Isn't he wonderful?
[42:45] &gt;&gt; Thank you for your prayers. My wife and
[42:46] I were away on some rest time and we
[42:50] enjoyed it very much. Well, we're doing
[42:52] a lot of uh we have a full day. We've
[42:57] got baby dedications. We have baptisms.
[43:02] We have the preaching of the word. We
[43:04] have Lord's supper. and foot washing.
[43:07] And isn't this wonderful?
[43:10] Hallelujah. And by the time we're done a
[43:13] time like that, somebody should be
[43:15] getting saved.
[43:18] We we've had that happen also. Looking
[43:21] down, Sister
[43:23] Debbie Gier, she came in on a day like
[43:25] this. I think we her we baptized her
[43:28] husband, believe it was. We had Lord's
[43:31] table and we had foot washing. By the
[43:34] time we were done all that, I went back
[43:35] to talk to her and her eyes were her
[43:38] eyes were just red with tears, all
[43:40] almost bloodshot. I could see then uh
[43:44] she was done.
[43:46] &gt;&gt; And about two weeks after that, we had
[43:48] her in the tank as well.
[43:50] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[43:51] &gt;&gt; Glory to God.
[43:54] Says, "Rejoice with them that rejoice."
[43:56] And so we have uh our brother
[44:01] brother Hughes message and sister Sylvia
[44:03] have just are celebrating their 50 one
[44:07] days of marriage 51st anniversary
[44:13] &gt;&gt; uh to the day. Amen.
[44:24] Brother Hugh has said that they were
[44:27] joined together in the presence of God
[44:29] as husband and wife and such was his
[44:31] love for us that he blessed us with five
[44:35] beautiful daughters.
[44:37] Uh I thought I did well at three but
[44:41] five beautiful daughters and they in
[44:43] turn blessed them with nine
[44:46] grandchildren.
[44:48] And there was a time, he said, in the
[44:50] darkest of nights when the storms of
[44:52] life almost sunk this ship. But the good
[44:55] Lord, who is mighty in battle in our
[44:58] darkest hour, placed his right foot on
[45:01] the prow of the boat. And to the winds
[45:04] of the strife and contention in our
[45:06] lives, he simply commanded them to
[45:08] cease.
[45:09] &gt;&gt; Amen. So we can rejoice with them that
[45:12] rejoice.
[45:13] &gt;&gt; Amen. And he said, "Peace." And to the
[45:16] waves of man's foolishness and strife,
[45:19] he commanded them to be still. That's
[45:21] very lovely. Brother Hugh, without his
[45:25] sovereign hand in our lives, that which
[45:27] God had joined together, we would have
[45:30] been torn aunder. But to God be the
[45:32] glory.
[45:33] &gt;&gt; Great things he has done.
[45:35] &gt;&gt; Let this be a testimony not only here,
[45:38] but to all those that may be streaming
[45:40] in whatever country. And friends, I'm
[45:42] happy again to be able to say today we
[45:45] hear from all over the world. We heard
[45:47] from Malawi in the last we heard from
[45:49] Singapore in the last few days. And
[45:51] we're just so delighted that this
[45:54] service today we can reach out with our
[45:57] rejoicing and with our testimony whether
[45:59] it be Norway or any place in Europe or
[46:02] our friends in Switzerland. How we love
[46:04] to we've established this hasn't been
[46:07] overnight, friends, but this has been
[46:08] for a long time. And as they as the
[46:12] camera uh you know uh spans or the
[46:17] congregation
[46:18] uh we go to many many places and they
[46:20] say where's brother so and so and
[46:22] where's sister so and so and they
[46:24] they've listened so intently they hear
[46:26] the names and different ones introduced
[46:29] or spoken to and and we'll probably hear
[46:32] how's brother Hugh and Sister Sylvia
[46:34] someday and we'll just say just fine and
[46:37] brother Hugh is finished we love you and
[46:39] our deeply appreciative of your kindness
[46:42] and especially of your prayers. Amen.
[46:47] &gt;&gt; This last last few days, uh, we've had
[46:50] one of us, one of our people leave, not
[46:53] of this church, but did come to this
[46:55] church for quite a long time. Brother
[46:58] Harp Senior, Brother Dalton Harp Senior,
[47:01] has gone to be in the presence of the
[47:04] Lord. And so, he's rejoicing. So, we're
[47:07] not going to be sad about it, but we're
[47:09] remembering the family, the entire
[47:11] family. And I have I had one picture and
[47:15] then brother Frank Prader had the
[47:19] service just this morning. So, this is
[47:22] uh just in the last uh few hours, last
[47:26] couple two, three hours. And for those
[47:29] of you that remember our brother Dalton,
[47:33] uh, Dalton Harp Senior, his son Dalton
[47:37] and Teresa, their family went here for
[47:39] years. And, uh, they're down in
[47:42] Arkansas. Also, Brother Harp Senior, and
[47:45] his wife, Sister Mary, they were
[47:47] attending here for years and are at
[47:49] brother Frank Prader's church. So, I
[47:52] thought I would just show a couple of
[47:54] these slides. Uh this is as of this
[47:57] morning
[48:00] and uh
[48:03] passed on September 13th.
[48:06] So this is the 16th. There they are as a
[48:09] young family,
[48:11] lovely, handsome family.
[48:14] And Sister Debbie and brother Mark
[48:16] Lowry. Sister Debbiey's a daughter.
[48:19] She's standing there, the tallest one.
[48:22] This is the life he loved.
[48:25] He even looked like that when he was
[48:27] playing a guitar.
[48:30] How many enjoyed his singing while he
[48:32] was here? Amen.
[48:37] I'm That's me baptizing him in a horse
[48:40] trough.
[48:42] So I thought that that is in keeping.
[48:45] And I baptized six and uh and several of
[48:49] them were quite a bit over six foot. And
[48:52] I studied the end of that tank and I
[48:55] said to them, I said, "You fellas better
[48:57] bend your knees a little bit while I put
[49:00] you down. I don't want to strike your
[49:02] head on the end of this tank." Uh, and I
[49:05] finished Brother Harp Senior and I had
[49:10] finished I think six of them and uh
[49:14] baptized. The water was cold
[49:15] incidentally.
[49:17] And then then there came a minister and
[49:20] his brother J. shepherd and he was
[49:23] dressed in one of the nicest powder blue
[49:25] suits that I've seen. It was uh had a
[49:30] vest, a four-piece suit or three-piece
[49:33] suit, and he had his old vested and he
[49:36] was just as prim. He was ready for the
[49:39] pullpit.
[49:42] He said, "I want to be baptized." I had
[49:44] already changed. So, they run in. I had
[49:47] to put my wet clothes on again and come
[49:49] out. And I saw him in that beautiful
[49:51] powder blue suit. It was just too pretty
[49:55] to put in that water.
[49:57] And I said I said, "Well, do you have
[50:00] some baptismal clothes?" He said, "Just
[50:02] like this." I said, "Well, do you have
[50:05] something to change into?" He said,
[50:07] "Just baptize me."
[50:10] I tell you, he was urgent. So I stepped
[50:12] in my wet clothes and he stepped in his
[50:15] beautiful powder blue suit and I
[50:18] baptized him in his suit. I don't know
[50:20] how much it shrunk after that but anyway
[50:24] he didn't care and I didn't care.
[50:26] Hallelujah.
[50:29] And the testimony kept rolling on.
[50:33] &gt;&gt; Praise God.
[50:34] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[50:35] &gt;&gt; There's uh brother Dalton with his two
[50:38] sons and gr and step and son-in-law. Oh,
[50:41] I should say brother Mark Lowry.
[50:45] There he is in one of his favorite
[50:46] poses.
[50:52] And I guess that's with them, too. I
[50:54] don't recognize him. That brother Prader
[50:56] is over here. Second from
[50:59] Brother Mark. And there they are at
[51:02] their 50th wedding anniversary
[51:07] also in 205.
[51:11] God bless our brother Harp
[51:14] and you remember the family in prayer.
[51:16] They're going to miss him. He's got uh a
[51:20] lot of grandchildren and and great
[51:23] grandchildren.
[51:25] So, we're so thankful. Are you ready for
[51:27] the word?
[51:29] &gt;&gt; Amen. Why don't we just stand to our
[51:31] feet?
[51:40] And before we open the scriptures, let's
[51:44] just pray.
[51:46] Nice to see you all here and saints from
[51:50] Seattle, Tacoma coming for the communion
[51:52] tonight. We're thankful,
[51:56] Father.
[51:58] how indebted we are and how thankful we
[52:02] are. Oh God, we just are rejoicing in
[52:08] your salvation. We're rejoicing in the
[52:11] deliverance. We're rejoicing in the
[52:14] victory over all the powers of the
[52:17] enemy. Oh God, we're mindful of the day
[52:20] that you redeemed us and you called us
[52:23] out of our life of doubt and unbelief
[52:27] and sin and how you have set us free and
[52:30] set us in heavenly places.
[52:32] &gt;&gt; Oh God, and we're rejoicing today that
[52:35] we can be gathered together in this time
[52:38] of fellowship. I pray that the sweet
[52:41] Holy Spirit will come and just bind our
[52:44] hearts in a wonderful, wonderful bond of
[52:47] love and peace. And I ask, Father, that
[52:50] you will give great liberty to your word
[52:52] now and give great revelation to our
[52:54] hearts that we might understand
[52:56] something more of this great eternal
[52:59] God. Oh, how great is our God and how
[53:04] marvelous are your ways past finding
[53:06] out. I pray that you will anoint father
[53:09] my my voice and anoint oh god my mind
[53:12] and the hearts of the people in the name
[53:14] of Jesus Christ. Let your word be as it
[53:17] is a living word
[53:20] &gt;&gt; healing wording
[53:22] &gt;&gt; delivering word and I pray that the
[53:24] supernatural will be in attendance with
[53:27] us father in Jesus Christ's name we ask
[53:30] it. Amen.
[53:33] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[53:34] I'm going to break from the normal. Do
[53:36] you mind that?
[53:38] &gt;&gt; I've been singing a song to myself
[53:41] and uh I think you know it, Elena. I was
[53:45] there when Jesus saved me. I was there
[53:47] when he saved me.
[53:50] Under the life he gave me. He took away
[53:52] my heavy burden.
[53:56] How many know it? We've sung it here
[53:58] many times.
[54:00] [Music]
[54:08] The very one my free. Oh, he took away
[54:13] my heavy burden and he gave me peace
[54:17] with him.
[54:20] Tried to take me down to me down.
[54:26] I was there when halfway and I guess I
[54:31] ought to know.
[54:34] I was there when Jesus saved me.
[54:37] The very moment he forgave me. Think
[54:40] about it. He took away my heavy burden
[54:44] and he gave me peace with him.
[54:47] Hallelujah.
[54:48] &gt;&gt; Satan tries to make me doubt it.
[54:52] &gt;&gt; But I'm going to shout it.
[54:55] shouting.
[54:56] &gt;&gt; I was there when it happened.
[54:58] &gt;&gt; And I guess my heart ought to know.
[55:04] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[55:05] I just felt I had that breakth
[55:08] [Music]
[55:11] on a Sunday morning. You weren't
[55:13] expecting that. But I've been singing
[55:15] that. I was there
[55:17] &gt;&gt; when it happened.
[55:19] &gt;&gt; No use anybody arguing about it. I was
[55:21] there.
[55:23] They're too late.
[55:24] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[55:26] &gt;&gt; You like that, don't you?
[55:28] &gt;&gt; I was there when Jesus saved me.
[55:31] The very moment he forgave me,
[55:35] he took away my heavy burden and he gave
[55:39] me peace within
[55:43] me.
[55:46] I'm sorry.
[55:53] I ought to know.
[55:58] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[56:00] &gt;&gt; Praise God.
[56:02] &gt;&gt; That should give us a good start.
[56:06] &gt;&gt; I want you to turn in the Bible, please,
[56:09] to Ephesians, the 5th chapter,
[56:13] and we're going to read three verses
[56:15] there.
[56:17] verses 14- 16.
[56:37] Wherefore he saith, Awake thou that
[56:40] sleepest, and arise from the dead, and
[56:44] Christ shall give thee light.
[56:46] See then that ye walk circumspectly,
[56:49] not as fools, but as wise, redeeming the
[56:53] time, because the days are evil.
[56:58] &gt;&gt; And those are the words I want you to
[57:00] remember in this service this morning.
[57:02] Remember redeeming the time because the
[57:06] days are evil. Please turn back to
[57:07] Psalms the 90th chapter
[57:12] and we'll read a few verses starting
[57:14] with verse 4
[57:16] down through verse 12.
[57:27] For a thousand years in thy sight, or
[57:30] but as yesterday, when it is passed, and
[57:34] as a watch in the night, thou carest
[57:37] them away as with a flood. They are
[57:40] asleep.
[57:41] In the morning they are like grass,
[57:43] which groweth up. In the morning it
[57:46] flourisheth, and groweth up. In the
[57:48] evening it is cut down, and witherth.
[57:51] For we are consumed in thy by thine
[57:54] anger, and by thy wrath. Are we
[57:57] troubled? Thou hast set our iniquities
[58:00] before thee. Our secret sins are in the
[58:03] light of thy countenance.
[58:05] For all thy days are passed away in thy
[58:09] wrath. We spend our years as a tale that
[58:13] is told. The days of our years are three
[58:17] score years and 10. And if by reason of
[58:20] strength they be four score years, yet
[58:24] is their strength labor and sorrow. For
[58:28] it is soon cut off, and we fly away.
[58:31] Who knoweth the power of thine anger,
[58:33] even according to thy fear, so is thy
[58:37] wrath. So teach us to number our days,
[58:42] that we may apply our hearts to wisdom.
[58:46] So the scripture says our our years are
[58:49] three score years and 10 and if by
[58:51] reason of strength they be four score
[58:54] years yet is their strength and labor
[58:57] and sorrow. And we're I I'm very pleased
[59:01] today that we have someone who God has
[59:03] given a lot more strength to and that's
[59:04] our brother Henry Hayes Senior.
[59:09] Our brother Henry Hayes right back here
[59:11] in the middle section I believe. I
[59:15] believe he's been given extra strength
[59:17] to about 93 years, isn't it? Is that
[59:21] about it?
[59:25] &gt;&gt; 94.
[59:27] &gt;&gt; 95.
[59:29] And standing there, do I hear 96?
[59:34] Hallelujah.
[59:37] I believe our brother Hayes should have
[59:39] a hand.
[59:42] I baptized brother Hayes in this tank
[59:46] &gt;&gt; and here he is this morning. God bless
[59:49] you all as you have your seats.
[59:58] &gt;&gt; I'll need to have your full attention. I
[1:00:01] hope I am able to say something that you
[1:00:04] can take away from here.
[1:00:08] I've been pondering this service for uh
[1:00:12] probably three weeks and I spent a good
[1:00:15] deal of the time away while I was away
[1:00:17] because I couldn't shake it and I
[1:00:19] couldn't get away from it. And
[1:00:21] furthermore, it's challenging. You know,
[1:00:24] we have a we have a a great eternal God
[1:00:28] who we as humans
[1:00:32] sometimes we are always,
[1:00:35] you know, we are we are so inclined to
[1:00:38] put him into a box and to try to bring
[1:00:41] him into this realm and you can't do
[1:00:43] that because he'll never he's eternal.
[1:00:48] &gt;&gt; So, I'm I'm going to challenge your mind
[1:00:51] and your thoughts today.
[1:00:54] And I want you to apply it to be able to
[1:00:57] apply it into your own lives.
[1:01:00] I'm I've entitled this message
[1:01:05] something I've never spoken on or tried
[1:01:07] to approach quite like this. But what is
[1:01:09] time? Begin to ask myself the question,
[1:01:12] what is time?
[1:01:15] And I thought another title I'd like to
[1:01:18] have given it is living in the now
[1:01:21] for the moment.
[1:01:24] And I read what some scientists have
[1:01:26] said and but brother Brandham he talked
[1:01:29] about uh I don't know whether he was
[1:01:31] speaking about Einstein. I was looking
[1:01:33] for the quote, but he spoke about, you
[1:01:36] know, the scientists and the those that
[1:01:39] delve into the beginnings of the earth
[1:01:42] and the big bang theory and all of this
[1:01:46] evolution and so on. But he was speaking
[1:01:49] about Einstein, I believe it was, and he
[1:01:51] just said that they what they were
[1:01:53] missing was the supernatural aspect.
[1:01:56] said that scientists had broken into
[1:01:58] God's laboratory, but they've just
[1:02:01] missed the supernatural aspect.
[1:02:04] If you take the equation, if you take
[1:02:07] God out of the equation, then the
[1:02:08] equation won't won't make any sense.
[1:02:12] &gt;&gt; And so that's why they're still trying
[1:02:14] to find that speck, that smallest of uh
[1:02:18] a particle. And they keep coming up with
[1:02:21] they find they think they found the god
[1:02:23] particle. And then if they can find the
[1:02:26] smallest, most minute, most invisible
[1:02:30] almost to the naked eye. It would be
[1:02:32] invisible to the naked eye. They have
[1:02:34] hopes that they would be able to
[1:02:35] understand the universe. Well, if they
[1:02:38] just read the Bible, they could
[1:02:39] understand the universe.
[1:02:41] &gt;&gt; But somehow it's not within their being
[1:02:44] to to just believe.
[1:02:47] &gt;&gt; And and yet they want other people to
[1:02:49] believe what you don't see. So, well, I
[1:02:51] can't see a quark, but but it's there
[1:02:53] because we can determine that, you know,
[1:02:56] light curves and what whatever more.
[1:03:00] I'd like to I'd like to suggest to you
[1:03:02] also that brother Brennham was tied into
[1:03:05] science in a big way, in a major way.
[1:03:09] And I've got a number of quotes. So, I'm
[1:03:10] going to go I I want to first just give
[1:03:14] you I have some things some slides here
[1:03:16] as well. And uh
[1:03:21] I want to have you read some with me.
[1:03:39] This is just how it came to me and I
[1:03:41] wanted to start the service with this.
[1:03:43] God the creator
[1:03:45] created the heavens and the earth and
[1:03:48] all things therein.
[1:03:50] Remember that's the only thing that
[1:03:52] Satan couldn't do. That's critical at
[1:03:54] this point. God the creator created this
[1:03:58] profusion of life and things which Satan
[1:04:02] could not do. Concluding his creation
[1:04:06] with one in his own likeness, Adam,
[1:04:09] putting him into time space. And that
[1:04:12] phrase time space is one that brother
[1:04:15] Brham used. It's a very scientific
[1:04:18] phrase and scientists and physicists use
[1:04:21] it and brother Brandham has used it many
[1:04:24] times starting very very early in his
[1:04:26] ministry.
[1:04:30] God allowed the fall of creation. He
[1:04:32] knew there would be a fall.
[1:04:35] He allowed the fall of creation to
[1:04:37] display his power and attributes of
[1:04:41] redemption.
[1:04:45] He created time as we know it as seasons
[1:04:50] in which he would manifest his great
[1:04:53] being
[1:04:54] that through the revelation of himself,
[1:04:58] his will and plan to ultimately destroy
[1:05:03] Satan, his enemy and the d the and the
[1:05:08] destroyer of his creation.
[1:05:12] And here's a quote I want to I'm giving
[1:05:15] you these two to begin with. Now this
[1:05:19] great chain of perfection,
[1:05:22] this is in the message perfection. Now
[1:05:24] this great chain of perfection was
[1:05:27] broken by time space. One of the times
[1:05:30] he uses it. Time came because of Sam.
[1:05:36] I'd like you all to say that with me.
[1:05:39] Time came because of sin. That is that
[1:05:43] is critical to my message this morning.
[1:05:47] What is time?
[1:05:49] Why is there time or is there time?
[1:05:55] Scientists some of the some of the
[1:05:57] senior scientists in the world believe
[1:06:01] believe and it's true. I believe it's
[1:06:03] true. There is no time.
[1:06:07] God created or brought about
[1:06:13] time so that his creature who he created
[1:06:17] could have something to relate to
[1:06:21] night and day
[1:06:23] &gt;&gt; and so on and so we'll go into it quite
[1:06:27] deeply
[1:06:30] because of sin he said let's draw a
[1:06:32] picture of time let's see a perfect
[1:06:35] circle
[1:06:36] forever, forever. And then all of all at
[1:06:39] once, sin dropped in and put a little
[1:06:43] hickey. Brother Bren had his wife call
[1:06:45] it a hickey or a little drop in that
[1:06:49] chain. That chain was a perfect circle.
[1:06:52] And so it comes down. Now, eternity
[1:06:55] continues on, but it's not in its
[1:06:58] perfect condition.
[1:07:01] There's a little gap comes down and
[1:07:03] breaks over this way. goes out this way.
[1:07:07] And God had to do that because Satan had
[1:07:11] caused it.
[1:07:14] And it dropped down to a space of time
[1:07:17] for the trying
[1:07:20] and the perfection and for the purging
[1:07:23] of the lost. That God by his sovereign
[1:07:27] grace might someday lift that little
[1:07:30] hickey or gap back into the perfect
[1:07:33] circle. And then she rolls on just the
[1:07:37] same.
[1:07:41] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:07:54] &gt;&gt; In the message Jesus Christ the same
[1:07:55] yesterday, today, and forever.
[1:07:59] We read, "We've had years now. There
[1:08:02] hasn't been so much done. Notice now all
[1:08:06] the references to time. We've had years
[1:08:08] now.
[1:08:09] There hasn't been too much done. But I
[1:08:13] truly believe that we're entering into
[1:08:14] the greatest time this world has ever
[1:08:18] seen. I certainly believe that there's
[1:08:21] coming a time
[1:08:24] that it's at hand now
[1:08:27] of God going to make himself manifested.
[1:08:31] the greatest he's ever done in all ages.
[1:08:33] I want to suggest to you that as
[1:08:36] Christians, as believers, we don't
[1:08:38] really have
[1:08:41] time
[1:08:42] as such. What they are is seasons of
[1:08:46] God's manifestation. He determines
[1:08:49] within his own great being. He'll
[1:08:51] manifest himself a certain way. He'll do
[1:08:55] certain things for a certain season.
[1:08:58] Then you can't bring it back. It's gone.
[1:09:00] So we say, well, that ended, you know,
[1:09:02] in in 1865.
[1:09:05] That's our calculation. It just all it
[1:09:09] was with God. He ceased that movement.
[1:09:12] He ceased that that he Jesus had seven
[1:09:16] messengers in his hand. So he sends one
[1:09:18] out. And we say, well, it's a certain
[1:09:20] time. All it is with God, he determines
[1:09:24] that in his great plan. Now it now it
[1:09:27] comes that he wants to reveal himself a
[1:09:29] certain way. So he sends a certain
[1:09:31] message and a certain group believes it
[1:09:34] and a certain group doesn't believe it
[1:09:36] and they go their ways and some are in
[1:09:39] cemeteries and and others are in a great
[1:09:42] host of witnesses someplace and then
[1:09:45] comes another message and then comes
[1:09:47] another one. Then come what is it? it.
[1:09:49] They are events of the eternal God just
[1:09:53] revealing himself in a continuation of
[1:09:56] creation
[1:09:58] &gt;&gt; in bringing back the perfection
[1:10:00] &gt;&gt; of that which fell.
[1:10:02] &gt;&gt; And I and and I will bring it to you in
[1:10:06] and I'm going to be repeating myself. I
[1:10:08] really believe that this season or what
[1:10:11] scientists are trying to determine is
[1:10:13] time and what is time and what was the
[1:10:16] origin and if we could only figure out
[1:10:18] the origin. I believe that everything
[1:10:21] that we know of and see as a as humanity
[1:10:26] and creation. I believe that God created
[1:10:31] this little orb called the earth with a
[1:10:34] profusion of life and creation
[1:10:38] &gt;&gt; to demonstrate to Satan, his archeneemy
[1:10:41] who had been cast to the earth that he
[1:10:44] can't do that.
[1:10:46] &gt;&gt; This is one thing you've always lusted
[1:10:48] to do and this is one thing you can't
[1:10:50] do. You were son of the morning and you
[1:10:52] were you were one of the leading angels,
[1:10:55] but you you lusted after and desired and
[1:10:59] were lifted up in pride. And here's
[1:11:02] something you can't do. And he creates
[1:11:04] all the things and the living creatures
[1:11:06] and the oceans are full of all kinds of
[1:11:09] creatures and all kinds of creatures on
[1:11:12] the earth and animals and so on so forth
[1:11:14] and ends up with his son, one like
[1:11:16] himself. And this is something Satan you
[1:11:18] can't do. And God knew that Satan was
[1:11:22] going to come and the fall was going to
[1:11:24] come. And so the second thing I believe
[1:11:26] that he intended to do is that he in in
[1:11:29] this season of manifestation, this
[1:11:32] series of seasons of manifestation of
[1:11:34] himself. I it's it's irrelevant to me
[1:11:38] how many thousands of years or millions
[1:11:40] of years or whatever it takes, but God
[1:11:43] was going to final finally come to the
[1:11:46] great climactic event of destroying his
[1:11:50] enemy.
[1:11:53] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:11:54] &gt;&gt; And and this little hickey or this
[1:11:57] little drop in the perfect circle of
[1:11:59] eternity is going to come back up.
[1:12:02] And during this time and all of these
[1:12:04] seasons of events are only seasons of
[1:12:07] redemption.
[1:12:09] &gt;&gt; And in each one there's a group of
[1:12:11] people that believes it.
[1:12:13] &gt;&gt; They believe the prophets.
[1:12:15] &gt;&gt; They believed in Jesus Christ.
[1:12:18] &gt;&gt; And some doubted and they went their
[1:12:21] way.
[1:12:22] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:12:24] &gt;&gt; Are you with me?
[1:12:26] &gt;&gt; And all the messages of the messengers
[1:12:28] come. And and then the last one has to
[1:12:30] be a prophet. Why? Because the word of
[1:12:34] God, the word which was Christ has to
[1:12:37] come to him
[1:12:39] &gt;&gt; in a certain way.
[1:12:42] &gt;&gt; I want you to pray, "God, give me a
[1:12:44] spirit of revelation
[1:12:46] &gt;&gt; this morning. Not tomorrow. Today, now.
[1:13:06] He says this is the ending up of the
[1:13:08] time and time will be no more one of
[1:13:11] these days. Uh we come out of eternity
[1:13:15] stepped into a little time space here
[1:13:19] and stepped out of time back into
[1:13:22] eternity.
[1:13:23] Uh we was before there was a world.
[1:13:27] Then we came into the world and we go
[1:13:30] out of the world back into the unknown
[1:13:34] to us now.
[1:13:39] And now in here we've had our savior
[1:13:42] come in here in this life in this world.
[1:13:45] We've had our savior come here to the
[1:13:47] earth. God himself made himself
[1:13:51] manifested. That's one of the seasons.
[1:13:55] You didn't live in the time Jesus was
[1:13:57] here on earth. We would have liked to,
[1:13:59] many of us. God chose that you should
[1:14:02] not live here when he was here on earth.
[1:14:05] God chose that you would live in another
[1:14:07] season.
[1:14:09] &gt;&gt; And you say, "Oh, if I'd only lived
[1:14:10] then, I'd have I'd have done this or I'd
[1:14:13] have done that." No, you'd have done
[1:14:14] exactly what you're doing now.
[1:14:18] &gt;&gt; Amen. and he made himself manifested to
[1:14:22] us and give us the hope of everlasting
[1:14:25] life, eternal life.
[1:14:29] I'll come on to
[1:14:31] well maybe I'll just carry on here a
[1:14:33] little bit.
[1:14:35] Time is a very precious commodity.
[1:14:41] You have been given a very small portion
[1:14:43] of it to manage.
[1:14:46] Every person is given the same amount to
[1:14:48] spend each day.
[1:14:52] It cannot be rolled over into the next
[1:14:55] day or added
[1:14:57] uh onto the end of one's life.
[1:15:01] It is spent entirely in that 24-hour
[1:15:04] period.
[1:15:07] &gt;&gt; Some people spend their time attaining
[1:15:09] wealth or fame, and many seek pleasure
[1:15:13] or fulfillment in other activities.
[1:15:16] And there are those who spend much time
[1:15:18] cultivating closer, deeper relationships
[1:15:21] with family and friends. And most of us
[1:15:24] spend a good deal of our allotted time
[1:15:27] in discharging our responsibilities and
[1:15:30] just dealing with daily life. And still
[1:15:33] others waste the precious time they have
[1:15:37] that they've been given and wonder how
[1:15:39] and why their lives have passed them by.
[1:15:46] There's volumes that have been written
[1:15:48] about time management and even spiritual
[1:15:51] time management.
[1:15:54] You have been sent here for a season and
[1:15:58] for a specific purpose. I'm going to
[1:16:00] turn your thoughts with God's help and I
[1:16:04] want to
[1:16:06] be able to bring you to the point is
[1:16:11] when the spirit of God moves or God
[1:16:14] speaks
[1:16:16] that is a instant that's given to you
[1:16:21] and when it's gone
[1:16:24] you cannot bring it back.
[1:16:27] Amen.
[1:16:30] &gt;&gt; Brother Brandaman speaking and when the
[1:16:32] angel of the Lord is right there,
[1:16:33] imagine the angel of the Lord, the
[1:16:35] pillar of fire, whatever you want to
[1:16:36] call him, right there at the platform
[1:16:39] manifesting himself and directly
[1:16:42] speaking to an individual in the
[1:16:44] congregation. And that God has not
[1:16:46] changed.
[1:16:48] &gt;&gt; He's exactly the same. I'm not him and
[1:16:52] you are not those people. But this God
[1:16:55] that I speak of is exactly the same God.
[1:16:59] He cannot change. He has not diminished
[1:17:02] in any one of his attributes. He's got
[1:17:05] as much mercy, as much power, as much
[1:17:07] supernatural here today as he has at any
[1:17:10] time. And whether he does something or
[1:17:13] doesn't do something, that's up to him.
[1:17:16] &gt;&gt; But one thing is absolutely critical is
[1:17:18] if the spirit of God or the voice of God
[1:17:21] is heard to you. I want to announce to
[1:17:24] you, you won't hear it the same in about
[1:17:27] two or three hours
[1:17:29] &gt;&gt; because it is right at that moment. And
[1:17:31] even brother Brand speaking to an
[1:17:32] individual and he says, "Oh God, she's
[1:17:35] going to miss it.
[1:17:37] &gt;&gt; What is she missing?" She's missing that
[1:17:39] instant
[1:17:42] &gt;&gt; in time that God has given to an
[1:17:45] individual and God knew it was going to
[1:17:48] happen. knew that person was going to be
[1:17:50] there, but they're whe whether they're
[1:17:52] so consumed with their condition or
[1:17:55] their circumstances or whatever it might
[1:17:58] be. And I want to say to this
[1:18:00] congregation, all that will ever hear
[1:18:02] this service and all who are streaming
[1:18:05] even now, don't miss your moment.
[1:18:09] &gt;&gt; Seize your moment.
[1:18:14] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:18:17] In the message countdown, he said if
[1:18:19] everything if everything serves God's
[1:18:21] purpose, it's got a resurrection.
[1:18:25] But if if only if but it can only rise
[1:18:29] if it serves God's purpose.
[1:18:33] &gt;&gt; But you can't keep anything in the
[1:18:35] ground that serves God's purpose that
[1:18:37] comes forth to testify of a
[1:18:39] resurrection. Why do we bring a
[1:18:40] resurrection in? Because resurrection is
[1:18:43] a continuation.
[1:18:44] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:18:47] this life in even even sin itself. He
[1:18:50] called that just a hickey. That's just a
[1:18:51] drop down in the cycle of perfection.
[1:18:57] &gt;&gt; In remembering the Lord, he said, "And
[1:18:58] if a man serves God's purpose, if we
[1:19:01] here serve God's purpose, there is a
[1:19:04] resurrection just as sure as anything.
[1:19:08] &gt;&gt; Only thing you have to do is God's just
[1:19:10] waiting on time,
[1:19:12] &gt;&gt; just like he is now. Amen.
[1:19:16] &gt;&gt; You think you're sitting in a Sunday
[1:19:17] morning service, but I have news for
[1:19:19] you. We happen to be sitting in a season
[1:19:22] of God's manifesting of himself.
[1:19:26] &gt;&gt; And we either will catch it or miss it.
[1:19:30] &gt;&gt; One or the two.
[1:19:33] &gt;&gt; In the message paradox,
[1:19:36] he said, "I believe in paradoxes. I
[1:19:38] believe in them with all of my heart."
[1:19:39] We said it's it's a paradox when all the
[1:19:42] smart men there was in the world and God
[1:19:46] put the key to the kingdom in the hands
[1:19:49] of one that was considered the ignorant
[1:19:52] and the unlearned and God put the hands
[1:19:55] uh put the key in the hands of those
[1:19:57] that were unlearned and ignorant put the
[1:20:00] key of the kingdom of God in their hands
[1:20:04] &gt;&gt; and bypassed the wise and the
[1:20:07] intelligent. He said, "And what's the
[1:20:09] most important thing in the world?" Here
[1:20:11] he's asking, and I would like, if
[1:20:13] brother Brandon was standing here asking
[1:20:14] you, I'm only echoing his voice. What is
[1:20:17] the most important thing in the world?
[1:20:21] &gt;&gt; The world you live in, the world you've
[1:20:23] been educated for, the skills you've
[1:20:25] learned, the the schooling you've had,
[1:20:27] the education you've received,
[1:20:30] everything that you have experienced,
[1:20:32] and the experience that you have gained.
[1:20:34] But what is the most important thing in
[1:20:36] the world? He said, "Is God's church?"
[1:20:41] &gt;&gt; That was a weak amen.
[1:20:43] &gt;&gt; For a question and an answer that the
[1:20:45] prophet has given to his own question.
[1:20:48] It's is God's church. God made the
[1:20:52] earth.
[1:20:53] &gt;&gt; That's pretty allencompassing, isn't it?
[1:20:56] God made the earth. He made it for a
[1:21:00] purpose
[1:21:02] &gt;&gt; to take a church out of it,
[1:21:04] &gt;&gt; a bride. And that's the most important
[1:21:08] important job in the world.
[1:21:12] &gt;&gt; So I don't care what it is that we're
[1:21:14] doing or what status we have in life or
[1:21:17] how humble or how high or whatever more.
[1:21:20] The most important thing in the world is
[1:21:22] the church.
[1:21:24] &gt;&gt; Number two, God made the earth. That's a
[1:21:27] pretty big statement, isn't it? He made
[1:21:29] the earth for the purpose of bringing
[1:21:33] out a church or a bride. And that's the
[1:21:37] most important job in the world. I'm
[1:21:40] giving these brief statements here not
[1:21:42] to preach a service to say things that
[1:21:45] may be uh that may anchor in somebody's
[1:21:49] heart
[1:21:50] &gt;&gt; and that will change the direction of
[1:21:52] your life
[1:21:53] &gt;&gt; that you'll go out of this service and
[1:21:55] say that's different.
[1:21:58] I've got to look at life different. I
[1:22:00] have to look at myself different.
[1:22:03] &gt;&gt; I have to look at the time that I've
[1:22:05] been given.
[1:22:06] &gt;&gt; Teach me, oh God, to number my days.
[1:22:16] The Bible has a great deal to say about
[1:22:18] our days spent here upon the earth and
[1:22:22] how they are spent and how they end.
[1:22:27] And God doesn't call a man to judgment
[1:22:29] without first warning him. He said, "God
[1:22:31] has put us here on the earth for a
[1:22:33] reason."
[1:22:34] &gt;&gt; So I announce to you, I feel that I am
[1:22:37] announcing, making some announcements.
[1:22:39] God has placed you. You, every one of
[1:22:44] you on the earth. God placed you here.
[1:22:48] &gt;&gt; Your mother and father didn't place you
[1:22:50] here. God placed you here.
[1:22:53] &gt;&gt; We just dedicated a little boy. God
[1:22:56] placed him here.
[1:22:57] &gt;&gt; He only used the parents to bring him.
[1:23:01] &gt;&gt; God sent you here. I need to make that.
[1:23:05] I need to emphasize that. You you you
[1:23:08] may have a family name, but God sent you
[1:23:11] here.
[1:23:12] &gt;&gt; You may have come from a certain
[1:23:14] background, a certain ethnic group, but
[1:23:17] God sent you here
[1:23:20] &gt;&gt; in this season
[1:23:22] &gt;&gt; at this time to use the number of days
[1:23:26] that he has allotted to you. And they
[1:23:29] have been allotted. And I read where the
[1:23:31] prophet said, "If a person is sick, God,
[1:23:34] the doctor may give you some medicine.
[1:23:36] And he may give you some uh uh
[1:23:38] antibiotics. He may give you something
[1:23:40] he said which is actually some poison
[1:23:42] into your system to kill the the germs
[1:23:47] and not too much otherwise it would kill
[1:23:49] you. Said that just to kill the germs
[1:23:51] and through that your life may be
[1:23:54] extended. But he made the announcement.
[1:23:56] He said he he said if if if your time is
[1:23:59] up there isn't amount any amount of
[1:24:01] medicine that will keep you here.
[1:24:04] And he said, "And if your time is not
[1:24:07] up, there's nothing in the world that
[1:24:09] can take you out of here.
[1:24:12] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Glory to God. God sent you
[1:24:17] here."
[1:24:18] &gt;&gt; This might be a simple message, friends,
[1:24:20] but it's going to be a mind shaker. God
[1:24:22] sent you here.
[1:24:24] &gt;&gt; And this isn't something that you just
[1:24:26] need to be enthused about now. It's
[1:24:28] something you need to go out these
[1:24:30] doors. You need to you need to mark it
[1:24:32] down in your calendar. Put it down in
[1:24:35] your book. Write it and inscribe it in
[1:24:37] the heart of your mind by the Holy
[1:24:39] Spirit. God sent me.
[1:24:41] &gt;&gt; Every day you need to rise saying God
[1:24:44] sent me here.
[1:24:45] &gt;&gt; This has nothing to do with my mother,
[1:24:47] father, my heritage, my background. God
[1:24:50] sent me here and he gave me my parents
[1:24:52] to perhaps uh in his great mind that I
[1:24:56] would have certain characteristics and
[1:24:58] certain abilities and certain something
[1:25:00] and I made a certain way. God made me.
[1:25:05] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:25:10] &gt;&gt; Even Peter and the apostles, brother
[1:25:13] Brown talks about James the prayer
[1:25:15] warrior. And Peter is as as rambunctious
[1:25:18] as Peter was. And you know, he was the
[1:25:20] one to step out of the boat and he was
[1:25:22] the one who drew his sword and he's
[1:25:24] going to kill this high uh high priest,
[1:25:27] the servant of the high priest. He's
[1:25:29] going to cut and he cut off his ear. He
[1:25:31] was going to do these things that God
[1:25:34] never took that out of him.
[1:25:37] &gt;&gt; He wanted that in him. All he did was
[1:25:39] index it around till it came under the
[1:25:41] control of the Holy Ghost and said under
[1:25:44] the control of Peter. And when they were
[1:25:46] all filled with the Holy Ghost on the
[1:25:48] day of Pentecost, it was Peter that
[1:25:50] stood up cuz he still had to have that
[1:25:52] nature. Hear my voice.
[1:25:56] &gt;&gt; Cuz he had been given the keys to the
[1:25:57] kingdom. He needed that nature. God gave
[1:26:01] you a certain nature. You might be more
[1:26:03] of a quiet person. He God gave it to you
[1:26:06] that way. And don't try. That's why
[1:26:08] brother Brandham says, "Don't try to be
[1:26:10] somebody else. Just be who you are. But
[1:26:13] surrender it all to God and God will use
[1:26:16] it for his kingdom. Someone else might
[1:26:18] preach the gospel all of the years. You
[1:26:20] might just be a quiet, quiet one on the
[1:26:22] sidelines say, "Nobody knows me. Nobody
[1:26:25] sees me." Whatever more. You may win one
[1:26:28] soul to Christ.
[1:26:29] &gt;&gt; If you live for Christ, you will be a
[1:26:31] testimony and win one soul for Christ.
[1:26:34] He doesn't say that that the servant of
[1:26:36] the Lord must be successful. Says he
[1:26:38] must be faithful.
[1:26:40] &gt;&gt; We must be faithful.
[1:26:42] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:26:49] &gt;&gt; God has put us here on the earth for a
[1:26:51] reason. And that reason that he has put
[1:26:53] us here for, we are responsible to him
[1:26:57] for that reason. You're not responsible
[1:26:59] to the church. You're not responsible to
[1:27:01] me. You're not responsible to anybody.
[1:27:04] You're responsible to God for that
[1:27:06] reason. And if God put you here to be to
[1:27:09] be an example to someone else, then
[1:27:11] you're responsible to them.
[1:27:12] &gt;&gt; If God as parents has given you
[1:27:14] children, you're responsible to the
[1:27:16] children. You brought them into the
[1:27:18] world. Now you have a responsibility to
[1:27:20] them to live a certain kind of life to
[1:27:22] teach them in a certain way.
[1:27:24] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:27:26] &gt;&gt; Glory to God. He says, "And then if our
[1:27:28] life is on the earth here, then we
[1:27:31] should go to the one who put us here."
[1:27:34] Now, this is where I feel that many in
[1:27:37] this congregation, that's what we need
[1:27:39] to do. What I'm going to read now, then
[1:27:42] we need to go to the one who put us
[1:27:45] here.
[1:27:47] &gt;&gt; Maybe you've gone to your parents or
[1:27:48] you've gone to somebody you admired and
[1:27:51] said, "What do you think I ought to do?"
[1:27:54] God is saying you need to go to the one
[1:27:56] who put you here. And after this
[1:27:59] service, you know, God put you here. We
[1:28:01] need to go to God and and who put us
[1:28:05] here. And Lord, what would you have me
[1:28:08] to do?
[1:28:12] &gt;&gt; It may not be just at the way
[1:28:14] circumstances fall that that's what you
[1:28:16] do. Say, "Well, I do this because of
[1:28:18] this, this, this." You know, God doesn't
[1:28:21] say, "Well, I will create the
[1:28:23] circumstances and then you will, you
[1:28:26] know, go according to the
[1:28:27] circumstances." No, we go to him and we
[1:28:30] ask him, "What would you have me to do?
[1:28:32] What must I do? Why am I here?"
[1:28:37] &gt;&gt; And if it's to be a housewife,
[1:28:40] there's many here that are.
[1:28:44] If it's to be a housewife, a dishwasher,
[1:28:47] if it's to be whatever, whatever God
[1:28:50] wants you to do, then you do that the
[1:28:53] very best that you know how to do it. No
[1:28:56] matter how little it is, you must do it.
[1:29:00] &gt;&gt; And that ought to resolve things for us.
[1:29:03] &gt;&gt; Whatever it is, there's no big eyes or
[1:29:06] small U's in this economy.
[1:29:10] and to whom we would go. He said, "And
[1:29:13] if we could sat down and take an
[1:29:15] inventory and ask the question of why
[1:29:18] are we here, how come that we ever come
[1:29:22] to this earth and what brought us here
[1:29:25] and where is our eternal destination
[1:29:28] going to be?"
[1:29:30] &gt;&gt; I haven't just selected certain things,
[1:29:32] friends. I pondered these very, very
[1:29:35] deeply.
[1:29:36] This generation is mentally consumed and
[1:29:41] occupied because Satan has filled this
[1:29:45] earth with in Satan's Eden. He's filled
[1:29:47] it with everything and especially this
[1:29:51] fits us all
[1:29:54] time.
[1:29:56] Who's got too much time? No, we don't
[1:29:58] have enough time. The kids in school
[1:30:02] don't have enough time. Everybody's all
[1:30:04] in a in a great big fluster. And
[1:30:09] my wife has a favorite phrase. Says, "I
[1:30:11] haven't got time."
[1:30:13] I said, "We're retired. That's all we
[1:30:15] have is time."
[1:30:22] So, I wanted to do it, but I just don't
[1:30:23] have enough time. And that's gone all
[1:30:26] over the world, dear. So,
[1:30:29] of course, you've never said that.
[1:30:33] Let's be honest.
[1:30:35] &gt;&gt; I want to preach to real people today.
[1:30:38] &gt;&gt; We just don't have enough time.
[1:30:40] &gt;&gt; We're under time constraint and time
[1:30:44] dict. So I started asking what is time?
[1:30:47] And I was happy to find some scientists
[1:30:49] that actually started to agree.
[1:30:53] They said time's an illusion.
[1:30:57] &gt;&gt; There's no such a thing as time.
[1:30:59] &gt;&gt; I said amen.
[1:31:01] That's going to be my doctrine.
[1:31:04] &gt;&gt; By the time I'm done preaching, you're
[1:31:06] going to know that I don't I believe
[1:31:07] there's no time
[1:31:12] &gt;&gt; and you're going to say, "Amen."
[1:31:15] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:31:18] &gt;&gt; I hope those 10 people are here when I'm
[1:31:20] done.
[1:31:24] Praise God.
[1:31:28] &gt;&gt; I say again, God
[1:31:31] created time as we know it for our
[1:31:34] purpose and for his own purpose rather
[1:31:38] to deal with sin and destroy the works
[1:31:42] of the devil.
[1:31:43] &gt;&gt; I'm going to give you scripture now.
[1:31:45] &gt;&gt; To destroy and to destroy him that had
[1:31:49] the power of death.
[1:31:52] Hebrews 2:14. You can write it down, but
[1:31:56] just listen while I read it to you,
[1:31:57] please. For as much then as the children
[1:32:02] are partakers of flesh. Now, children
[1:32:05] come into the family at a certain
[1:32:07] season, at a certain time. And he says,
[1:32:10] the children are partakers of flesh and
[1:32:14] blood. He also himself likewise
[1:32:19] took part of the same. He had to come
[1:32:22] and at a certain time he was born.
[1:32:25] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:32:26] &gt;&gt; And took part of flesh and blood
[1:32:29] that through death
[1:32:32] he might destroy him
[1:32:36] &gt;&gt; who had the power of death.
[1:32:39] &gt;&gt; So this is not the destroying of bad
[1:32:41] things. This is destroying of the author
[1:32:44] of bad things.
[1:32:47] &gt;&gt; God created time. The prophet said it.
[1:32:51] The Bible tells it. We'll come to it.
[1:32:53] God created time. Space time. Science
[1:32:57] can't figure it out. They say it must be
[1:32:59] an illusion.
[1:33:03] And you'll think about that in a few
[1:33:04] moments a lot deeper. But I say God
[1:33:07] created it. I was saying this in some
[1:33:11] messages even months perhaps some years
[1:33:14] ago
[1:33:16] and I couldn't quite support it but I
[1:33:19] was throwing it out to the people. I
[1:33:22] believe that God made time created time
[1:33:25] to destroy the devil
[1:33:28] &gt;&gt; and then then this scripture comes as
[1:33:30] such a such a quickening I was so
[1:33:33] quickened to it that he might destroy
[1:33:35] him
[1:33:36] &gt;&gt; who had the power of death.
[1:33:39] So if you destroy him who has the power
[1:33:42] of death, guess what? Death goes and he
[1:33:45] goes.
[1:33:48] &gt;&gt; And what is that? That's nothing less
[1:33:50] than the lake of fire.
[1:33:51] &gt;&gt; I'm not interested where it is or when
[1:33:54] it is. He's doomed.
[1:33:57] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And by the same God and by
[1:34:00] the same creator, I and you and everyone
[1:34:04] who is given the faith to believe, we
[1:34:07] have eternal life. We've just dipped
[1:34:10] down into this hickey called a trial.
[1:34:13] &gt;&gt; We're just here for a little trial
[1:34:15] season. And he said it's the word.
[1:34:19] &gt;&gt; It's to prove his word is faithful and
[1:34:21] true. And God's going to put it in the
[1:34:24] devil's face one of these days. You
[1:34:27] thought you could get them. You could
[1:34:29] not get them. I ordained them. I
[1:34:32] predestinated them to eternal life. This
[1:34:35] hickey is going to end now. And you're
[1:34:38] going to your
[1:34:40] place
[1:34:42] and I am done with you now. You will
[1:34:45] never stand beside the throne in heaven
[1:34:48] again. I cast you to the earth and then
[1:34:51] I did my creation on the earth. It was
[1:34:54] the womb for my seed.
[1:34:56] &gt;&gt; And he he said and and God said and he
[1:34:59] created two great lights.
[1:35:02] &gt;&gt; God said let there be light. Why did he
[1:35:06] say that? So that one would control the
[1:35:08] day and one would control the night.
[1:35:12] Amen.
[1:35:13] &gt;&gt; And everything that we have here as
[1:35:15] humans, we have it. We have a scale to
[1:35:19] relate things to say, "Oh, that is 10 ft
[1:35:23] away by from by what measurement?"
[1:35:28] Oh, no, it's not 10. It's it's 3 m.
[1:35:33] Oh, you're going to go out and you're
[1:35:35] going to step in your car and you're
[1:35:36] going to drive down the road 50
[1:35:38] kilometers an hour.
[1:35:41] By what scale? Well, by the speed of
[1:35:45] motion across the ground. The only thing
[1:35:48] so we weigh we weigh things in pounds
[1:35:51] and kilos etc.
[1:35:55] Everything is in a relationship.
[1:35:58] &gt;&gt; But time is is scaled. The scale for
[1:36:03] time is motion.
[1:36:05] &gt;&gt; So we say, well, he's going 60
[1:36:07] kilometers or he's going 60 miles an
[1:36:09] hour down the road.
[1:36:12] That's 60. He's going a certain distance
[1:36:16] motion
[1:36:18] in one hour. And that hour relates
[1:36:21] directly to the sun and the movement of
[1:36:24] the earth. The movement of the earth in
[1:36:28] its rotation in relationship to the sun.
[1:36:31] That's how come we have an hour.
[1:36:34] &gt;&gt; This light will be for days and for
[1:36:37] time. So now we have a relationship
[1:36:40] &gt;&gt; and you're going to live a certain
[1:36:42] length of time. And God says, "Teach me
[1:36:45] to number my days." Listen folks, I'm
[1:36:48] giving some announcements today. You
[1:36:50] only have so many.
[1:36:56] &gt;&gt; And we can live just to grind our way
[1:36:59] through life. Say, "Well, I'm going to
[1:37:02] get an education." That's fine. And it
[1:37:05] doesn't matter whether you're a
[1:37:06] housewife, a dishwasher, a plumber, or a
[1:37:09] carpenter, or uh a scientist or a
[1:37:12] teacher or whatever more. You do it for
[1:37:16] an eternal purpose.
[1:37:18] &gt;&gt; I'm here in a certain season to manifest
[1:37:22] that a God sent a certain word
[1:37:25] &gt;&gt; at this time to tell us that we're at a
[1:37:28] certain point in the word of God.
[1:37:30] &gt;&gt; I've been sent here to live out my
[1:37:33] portion of the word so that the world
[1:37:35] will know it's not just the end and bad
[1:37:38] things are happening and what's
[1:37:39] happening to this world. But a person
[1:37:42] lives in this world says, "You know
[1:37:43] what? I think he knows where he's going.
[1:37:46] &gt;&gt; I think his head is screwed on straight.
[1:37:49] Excuse my terminology. I think this guy
[1:37:52] has got it. He's got it together.
[1:37:55] &gt;&gt; Why is he saying that? Because believers
[1:37:57] are different.
[1:38:00] &gt;&gt; Believers are different.
[1:38:03] I held one slide back which was brother
[1:38:06] Harp
[1:38:07] with his siblings,
[1:38:12] his two brothers and his sister.
[1:38:19] I can tell you if I didn't know if I
[1:38:22] didn't know the man's name or I never
[1:38:24] met him, I could identify instantly the
[1:38:27] believer.
[1:38:30] &gt;&gt; Why? He's got it together.
[1:38:33] &gt;&gt; He knows who he is.
[1:38:35] &gt;&gt; He's got it. It's all over his face.
[1:38:37] It's all over his whole being. I don't
[1:38:39] even have to hear a word. I just look at
[1:38:41] him and say, "He knows where he's
[1:38:43] going."
[1:38:44] &gt;&gt; He's a different kind of a person. He's
[1:38:47] a different creature. He's got it
[1:38:49] together.
[1:38:53] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen?
[1:39:06] In the falling apart of the world,
[1:39:08] you'll need to really try to stay with
[1:39:10] the structure. I labored very very much
[1:39:13] and for very very many hours and days
[1:39:18] to structure this so that I hope it will
[1:39:21] stay clear in your mind and I try not to
[1:39:23] interrupt myself too much.
[1:39:28] in the falling part of the world. He
[1:39:29] says, "The one who created the heaven
[1:39:31] and the earth expresses himself back
[1:39:35] through his creation."
[1:39:41] &gt;&gt; What he has, what he is in his program.
[1:39:47] &gt;&gt; God has a program.
[1:39:50] &gt;&gt; Friends, these are very deep statements.
[1:39:53] They're not mine. There are prophet
[1:39:55] statements who tapped into eternity all
[1:39:57] the time.
[1:40:00] &gt;&gt; The one who created the heaven and the
[1:40:02] earth. Don't let this sound so big. You
[1:40:05] mean the very the very air you're going
[1:40:08] to breathe is part of this creation. The
[1:40:10] grass you walk on, the water you drink,
[1:40:13] everything is part of this creation. And
[1:40:15] you are part of this creation. And you
[1:40:17] have to say as I am saying, why are we
[1:40:20] here? And why has God given us this span
[1:40:23] of time? And then what is time?
[1:40:26] &gt;&gt; And God has said in his word that we
[1:40:30] need to teach us to number our days. And
[1:40:34] he said further, we need to redeem the
[1:40:36] time.
[1:40:37] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:40:37] &gt;&gt; And in redeeming the time, it goes a
[1:40:40] little bit. I'd like to put this down.
[1:40:43] To redeem the time is to secure to
[1:40:46] redeem it is to secure the season for
[1:40:49] yourself.
[1:40:51] That's what the dagot says. Secure this
[1:40:54] season for yourself.
[1:40:56] &gt;&gt; So I'm living here 2012. So what? What's
[1:40:59] 2012? Doesn't exist. It's an illusion.
[1:41:02] Your own scientists say it's an
[1:41:04] illusion.
[1:41:06] Amen.
[1:41:12] &gt;&gt; In contempt for the faith, he said, "For
[1:41:14] if he was God's expression," speaking of
[1:41:17] Jesus Christ, he asked the people, "Do
[1:41:19] you believe that?" God was expressing
[1:41:21] his attitude towards his fallen creation
[1:41:24] through the Lord Jesus Christ. He
[1:41:26] expressed himself that way. And in the
[1:41:30] message, I am the resurrection. And then
[1:41:32] I'm going to just change direction for a
[1:41:34] moment. In the message, I am the I am
[1:41:36] the resurrection and the life. He says,
[1:41:38] "And God the great creator who's
[1:41:40] expressed himself through all of his
[1:41:43] creation." God the creator who has
[1:41:47] expressed himself through all of his
[1:41:50] creation. Hello folks.
[1:41:54] &gt;&gt; Are you part of his creation?
[1:41:57] &gt;&gt; Are you part of his creation?
[1:42:02] You say, "Well, Brother Ed, that's a
[1:42:04] foolish statement." No, it's not a
[1:42:05] foolish statement because we may put our
[1:42:08] hand up and say, "I'm a part of his
[1:42:09] creation." And walk out these doors and
[1:42:11] live like we're disconnected from it.
[1:42:16] &gt;&gt; I want to go on from there. If you
[1:42:18] really believe you're part of his
[1:42:20] creation, then you were sent here by him
[1:42:24] for a purpose.
[1:42:25] &gt;&gt; Amen. Then we need to ask ourselves, am
[1:42:28] I serving that purpose?
[1:42:31] &gt;&gt; Am I working? What am I working for?
[1:42:34] What am I living for? What am I doing?
[1:42:37] Am I just seeking to make life easier
[1:42:40] here? Are we just getting things better
[1:42:43] here? Or am I just going on day after
[1:42:45] day after day? Or am I living here to be
[1:42:48] a to be uh do I have a divine purpose
[1:42:51] and a divine direction in this life? And
[1:42:54] hey, it doesn't it doesn't have to be
[1:42:56] some great big achievement. It's not
[1:42:58] that. You just live every day.
[1:43:00] &gt;&gt; And somebody who's standing beside you
[1:43:03] knows,
[1:43:04] &gt;&gt; uh we we sat on the plane. There's a
[1:43:06] couple in front of us. And I said to my
[1:43:10] wife after we just getting ready to land
[1:43:12] in Bellingham, I said, "There's a nice
[1:43:14] couple."
[1:43:16] I said, "I've been watching them. I've
[1:43:18] been watching her because just foot in
[1:43:22] front of me.
[1:43:24] I said, "They're nice." You know, I I
[1:43:26] like them. They look like a real good
[1:43:28] solid couple.
[1:43:30] And uh
[1:43:32] I said, you know, she's got her hair
[1:43:34] drawn back and a big bread up here and
[1:43:38] so on. I don't know. They might be here.
[1:43:40] We told them where we were. And uh
[1:43:44] and I said, "They're nice couple." When
[1:43:45] we got off the plane, we were the kind
[1:43:47] of the last one just at the baggage, not
[1:43:50] the baggage counter, but where they give
[1:43:52] you the bags off the plane was small, so
[1:43:54] they take your carry-on. So, we're there
[1:43:56] at the carry-on cart. And uh so I said,
[1:43:59] "Well, are you folks home?" And he said,
[1:44:03] "Well, well, she is. I'm not." Oh. I
[1:44:06] said, "Well, well," she says, "Yeah."
[1:44:08] She says, "I I live here, but he he
[1:44:10] works up in Alaska." Oh my goodness. So
[1:44:13] we had a little conversation, you know,
[1:44:15] just real real quick. And so I said,
[1:44:17] 'Well, then you live in Bellingham. No,
[1:44:18] he says, 'I live in Lynon.' I said, '
[1:44:20] Okay.' And uh I says, 'Well, my wife, I
[1:44:24] said, she's she's half Canadian, half
[1:44:27] American. And he says, well, yeah, my
[1:44:29] wife, she was uh she wasn't born here
[1:44:32] either. I says, "Oh, I slapped him on
[1:44:35] the shoulder. I said, 'What do you have
[1:44:36] to do? Come up to Canada, get a wife?"
[1:44:38] "No, no, no." She says, "I'm not
[1:44:39] Canadian. And I'm said, I was born in
[1:44:42] Switzerland and but my parents were
[1:44:44] missionaries and we lived in South
[1:44:46] Africa. Oh. I said, 'Well, isn't that
[1:44:49] interesting? I said, I'm a pastor. Oh,
[1:44:51] they said, what what church? And I said,
[1:44:53] Cloverdale Bible Way. And they said,
[1:44:55] what's the name? Cloverdale Bible Way.
[1:44:57] And uh I said, we're we're just up in in
[1:45:00] Canada. And uh so a moment or two later,
[1:45:04] you know, just a couple moments later,
[1:45:08] his wife was from Lyndon. So he and he
[1:45:12] was interested. I so we got talking
[1:45:13] about Sitka, Alaska, where he is and why
[1:45:15] he's up there and he's electrician. And
[1:45:18] so we're just having, you know, a little
[1:45:19] conversation. So he said, "Where's your
[1:45:22] church?" And she said, "It's in Siri."
[1:45:26] So we knew right away they'd heard about
[1:45:28] us.
[1:45:31] They're a nice couple. Real nice couple.
[1:45:34] So, they've been they've been affected
[1:45:36] by the gospel. I can tell they've been
[1:45:38] affected by the gospel. At whatever
[1:45:40] degree you you receive it, I I believe
[1:45:43] it's fine. But believers of this message
[1:45:45] have been affected,
[1:45:47] &gt;&gt; by another power,
[1:45:50] &gt;&gt; by another spirit.
[1:45:52] &gt;&gt; You can't hide it.
[1:45:54] &gt;&gt; It's just evident.
[1:45:55] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:45:56] &gt;&gt; People know it right away. And I say,
[1:45:58] hallelujah.
[1:45:59] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And you have been brought
[1:46:01] here for this season. And we are in the
[1:46:04] season of the seventh angel.
[1:46:08] &gt;&gt; Oh, what a privilege.
[1:46:10] &gt;&gt; We are in a season of the redemption,
[1:46:14] the conclusion of redemption. We're here
[1:46:16] to see the windup.
[1:46:24] &gt;&gt; Give me another few minutes, would you?
[1:46:28] &gt;&gt; Okay. creation as of time as we know it.
[1:46:31] And God said, "Let there be lights in
[1:46:33] the firmament of the heaven to divide
[1:46:36] the day from the night and let them be
[1:46:39] for signs and for seasons and for days
[1:46:43] and for years."
[1:46:45] In the 16th verse, and God made two
[1:46:47] great lights, the greater light to rule
[1:46:50] the day and the lesser light to rule the
[1:46:53] night, and he made the stars also. And
[1:46:57] so because of that, we have hours and
[1:47:00] weeks and days and months and years, but
[1:47:05] don't mean a thing.
[1:47:08] &gt;&gt; Only for us while we're here.
[1:47:11] &gt;&gt; Are you with me?
[1:47:14] &gt;&gt; So everything is in relationship to
[1:47:16] that.
[1:47:18] And we have a scale that we can relate
[1:47:20] the events to. Events that God brings
[1:47:24] into being. We say, "Well, that happened
[1:47:27] 13 years ago or as brother Hugh Messi
[1:47:30] says, 51 years ago today.
[1:47:35] We were united in marriage." Well,
[1:47:38] that's all in relationship. You say,
[1:47:40] "Well, why is that important?" It's very
[1:47:43] important, friends. Very important.
[1:47:48] Because I am convinced
[1:47:55] And you don't want to be one of the ones
[1:47:56] I'm speaking about now. There are many
[1:48:00] who have been touched by the message,
[1:48:04] who've heard of the message,
[1:48:07] who have read what God himself did
[1:48:12] &gt;&gt; through a prophet
[1:48:14] &gt;&gt; to the people. And you are also
[1:48:18] witnesses
[1:48:19] &gt;&gt; of what God has done in this season.
[1:48:22] Amen.
[1:48:23] &gt;&gt; But there are multitudes. And as I
[1:48:25] travel, I see that it's like a a wave
[1:48:30] that can consume the people to such a
[1:48:33] degree that they lose sight.
[1:48:36] &gt;&gt; They lose sight of what their purpose is
[1:48:40] &gt;&gt; on earth.
[1:48:41] &gt;&gt; Why am I here? And they lose sight. And
[1:48:44] the spirit of God comes in. I was
[1:48:47] listening. Do you have a little time?
[1:48:48] Amen.
[1:48:51] &gt;&gt; I listened to a service and I can give
[1:48:53] it to you now. I listened to a service
[1:48:56] years ago
[1:48:58] and the air was so tight and the service
[1:49:02] was so tight I could do nothing but have
[1:49:05] just compassion and oh it's one of those
[1:49:07] service you don't hardly want to sit in.
[1:49:09] And brother Brandham just hewed to the
[1:49:11] line and came down and oh my and you can
[1:49:16] see that there's no response to the
[1:49:18] people and and and then and then he
[1:49:21] starts and he does something very
[1:49:22] unusual. He doesn't usually have a long
[1:49:25] altar call but he starts calling for
[1:49:28] people to come. Is there someone and he
[1:49:31] spoke on influence?
[1:49:34] And he he said, "Is there someone that
[1:49:37] would need Christ if you need Jesus
[1:49:39] Christ?"
[1:49:41] And they're thinking, "When the coal of
[1:49:44] fire touch the prophet,
[1:49:48] making him as
[1:49:51] clean could be." Is there someone
[1:49:55] is someone want to give their heart to
[1:49:57] Christ? you're here without Christ and
[1:50:01] you know you should be saved. And he
[1:50:03] went on and plead no one. He said,
[1:50:05] 'Well, if everyone must be saved. Is
[1:50:09] there anyone that's a backslider? Are is
[1:50:11] anyone here a backslider? He carries on.
[1:50:15] No, you just come forward and we'll pray
[1:50:18] for you. There's nobody.
[1:50:22] Carries on. They're singing and playing.
[1:50:25] says, "Is there anyone here that needs
[1:50:27] the baptism of the Holy Ghost? Would you
[1:50:31] like to come down to the front?
[1:50:34] Anyone needing the baptism?" No one
[1:50:36] comes. No one comes. No one comes.
[1:50:42] Finally, one man comes. Said, "God bless
[1:50:48] this humble brother.
[1:50:50] May he be another Isaiah."
[1:50:54] and he's down to the front
[1:50:57] and then he says something along this
[1:50:59] order
[1:51:01] now. He said,
[1:51:04] "You've done the most horriblest thing
[1:51:09] that you could have ever done in your
[1:51:12] life."
[1:51:15] That was that moment.
[1:51:18] &gt;&gt; They did not recognize that voice.
[1:51:24] And then God through his servant begins
[1:51:28] to call out calls out a man. Nobody up
[1:51:31] before him on the platform calls out a
[1:51:33] man. And he said, "You, sir."
[1:51:37] And he begins to reveal the secret of
[1:51:39] his heart. He said, "And your name is
[1:51:41] Mr. Blackwood,
[1:51:44] and this is what's wrong with you." And
[1:51:47] then another person and another woman
[1:51:52] and he called tells Mr. Blackwood where
[1:51:54] he lives. And then this woman and
[1:51:57] another woman by name and another woman
[1:52:00] by name and another woman by name calls
[1:52:03] out four of them by name. and then
[1:52:06] others just what what what they're what
[1:52:09] what what is they're there for and what
[1:52:12] and the secret of their heart to begin
[1:52:15] unveiling one after the other after the
[1:52:17] other across that audience. Now, who
[1:52:20] wants the Holy Ghost and they flooded
[1:52:22] down and packed the altar and packed the
[1:52:27] sides of the building and the aisles and
[1:52:30] he says this and you'll find it. He
[1:52:32] said, "I did this to show you that I
[1:52:36] spoke the truth,
[1:52:40] &gt;&gt; they wouldn't come to the truth,
[1:52:43] &gt;&gt; but they would come because they people
[1:52:44] have been called out. So, they came as a
[1:52:46] result of the gift."
[1:52:48] &gt;&gt; And you know what he fed end up saying?
[1:52:52] I did this to show you you've been
[1:52:54] deceived. Right.
[1:52:56] &gt;&gt; And the deception was that they would
[1:52:59] come to something that emotionally
[1:53:01] pulled them
[1:53:02] &gt;&gt; but would not come to the preaching of
[1:53:04] the word
[1:53:05] &gt;&gt; and they missed their moment.
[1:53:09] &gt;&gt; When the word is preached
[1:53:11] &gt;&gt; and something is tingling down inside,
[1:53:14] seize the moment
[1:53:16] [Applause]
[1:53:19] cuz it's not going to happen tomorrow.
[1:53:21] It's not going to happen in the shopping
[1:53:23] mall. It's not going to happen at
[1:53:25] school. It's not going to happen on the
[1:53:27] job site. You want to seize the moment.
[1:53:32] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen?
[1:53:34] &gt;&gt; You ought to say, "God, help me seize
[1:53:36] the moment."
[1:53:40] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:53:42] &gt;&gt; Say, "Well, God's spirit speaking to
[1:53:44] me." Reach out.
[1:53:46] &gt;&gt; Seize that moment. It's not my moment.
[1:53:48] It's your moment. Amen.
[1:53:51] &gt;&gt; You're the one that changes the service.
[1:53:54] &gt;&gt; You're the one that turns it.
[1:53:56] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:53:58] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Friends, we've been called
[1:54:00] under. We want to seize the moment. When
[1:54:03] we talk about this message, we're not
[1:54:05] talking about some little idol thing.
[1:54:07] We're talking about the greatest thing
[1:54:08] that God did
[1:54:10] &gt;&gt; during civilization
[1:54:12] &gt;&gt; of humanity.
[1:54:14] It's hard for us to recognize. may be
[1:54:16] hard for us to identify or hard for us
[1:54:19] to confess. We are living in the
[1:54:22] greatest manifestation that God ever did
[1:54:26] upon the earth.
[1:54:28] [Applause]
[1:54:30] &gt;&gt; And we ought to rise to it
[1:54:32] &gt;&gt; and say, "What a moment
[1:54:34] &gt;&gt; that God has called me to be here.
[1:54:38] &gt;&gt; What an hour.
[1:54:42] &gt;&gt; What a privilege.
[1:54:44] &gt;&gt; What an honor.
[1:54:46] Oh father,
[1:54:48] &gt;&gt; you who sent me here
[1:54:51] &gt;&gt; for a divine purpose,
[1:54:53] &gt;&gt; I will not waste idly the time you have
[1:54:56] given.
[1:54:58] &gt;&gt; I will not waste the energy that you
[1:55:00] have put into this body.
[1:55:02] &gt;&gt; I will use it for your glory.
[1:55:05] &gt;&gt; Whether I'm a housewife or a worker or a
[1:55:07] student or whatever I am, you can live
[1:55:10] for Christ.
[1:55:11] &gt;&gt; Live such a testimony.
[1:55:35] I've said quite a bit about science and
[1:55:37] I don't want to
[1:55:39] take up too much more time,
[1:55:43] but scientists have much to say about
[1:55:45] time.
[1:55:47] The the Bible has much to say about it
[1:55:51] and brother Brandham said much about it
[1:55:54] as well. And they have said there's many
[1:55:57] questions about the nature of time and
[1:55:59] what is time and what causes time. So
[1:56:02] they say time is an emergent concept
[1:56:06] and there there is an underlying process
[1:56:08] of motion and forces from which time
[1:56:12] emerges
[1:56:13] and what we perceive of time is mostly
[1:56:16] an illusion. Now listen closely. Number
[1:56:18] one,
[1:56:21] our memory creates
[1:56:24] the illusion of the past. That's as
[1:56:27] science has described it. We all have a
[1:56:30] past.
[1:56:33] Conscious perception of events
[1:56:36] gives us the feeling of the present.
[1:56:40] And the future is a metal construct,
[1:56:42] something we construct,
[1:56:45] patterned on our memory experience of
[1:56:47] the of the past. It's our future.
[1:56:53] You know what science was missing? Jesus
[1:56:56] Christ.
[1:56:58] the same
[1:56:59] &gt;&gt; yesterday,
[1:57:02] &gt;&gt; today,
[1:57:03] &gt;&gt; and forever.
[1:57:07] &gt;&gt; Past,
[1:57:09] &gt;&gt; present
[1:57:11] &gt;&gt; to science, it's an illusion.
[1:57:14] &gt;&gt; But if you have Jesus Christ in your
[1:57:17] past,
[1:57:18] &gt;&gt; that's as real as it is now. Amen.
[1:57:21] &gt;&gt; If you have Jesus Christ and today they
[1:57:25] have said that the past is a series of
[1:57:28] you know things that are in our memory
[1:57:31] and the future is in our anticipation.
[1:57:34] And all listen to me closely. All you
[1:57:38] actually have
[1:57:41] is called an infatismal.
[1:57:45] Scientists have called it infatismal.
[1:57:48] Now
[1:57:50] &gt;&gt; you have this moment.
[1:57:59] &gt;&gt; Say, well, you know, I don't feel
[1:58:02] I don't feel like reaching out. I don't
[1:58:05] feel really moved. You don't need to
[1:58:08] feel it. You just need to sit down and
[1:58:10] think about it real deep.
[1:58:15] My greatest decisions don't come in a
[1:58:17] moment of excitement.
[1:58:22] &gt;&gt; I sit at home or I go away and I ponder.
[1:58:30] What's life all about?
[1:58:33] What's this ministry all about?
[1:58:36] And I know
[1:58:40] I'm going to see him.
[1:58:45] And I even tell you some of my private
[1:58:47] prayers
[1:58:49] while I was away.
[1:58:51] Lord,
[1:58:53] when my time comes, receive me in peace.
[1:59:00] &gt;&gt; I know what's going to happen. And I
[1:59:02] know I'm not going to go to
[1:59:05] as believers, we're not going to go
[1:59:08] and die as a dog and be buried
[1:59:13] in some grave.
[1:59:17] I began to let my life and my my whole
[1:59:22] mind go over my life.
[1:59:26] Then you begin to thank God. I thank
[1:59:29] God. And you know what I respond? I
[1:59:31] don't I don't rejoice over the times
[1:59:34] that I ignored his voice.
[1:59:38] &gt;&gt; I grieve over that.
[1:59:40] &gt;&gt; But I rejoice over the times I obeyed
[1:59:42] his voice
[1:59:45] &gt;&gt; because what I did at that time and what
[1:59:47] you're doing and what we do here in this
[1:59:49] church and what we want to continue to
[1:59:51] do and and I'm giving you everything
[1:59:54] that's in my heart as my last service.
[1:59:57] sees the moment
[1:59:59] &gt;&gt; cuz it's the only time you have
[2:00:02] &gt;&gt; you do not have to be filled with some
[2:00:04] excitement or enthusiasm. All you have
[2:00:07] to do is sit and quietly think this is
[2:00:10] my time. I will not let it bypass. I am
[2:00:14] going to stand and I'm going to dedicate
[2:00:17] all that I am because the enthusiasm may
[2:00:21] leave you and it will leave you in the
[2:00:23] next few moments. But when you say, "I
[2:00:26] am done. I'm done with my waste." Or, "I
[2:00:30] am done with the the casual attitude
[2:00:33] that I've had. I'm finished."
[2:00:36] &gt;&gt; Satan is trying to rob me of my reward.
[2:00:39] &gt;&gt; And I am now rising against it.
[2:00:43] &gt;&gt; And I changed my course by God's grace.
[2:00:48] &gt;&gt; And I am finished with the enemy.
[2:00:52] I'm finished with this waste
[2:00:54] &gt;&gt; of my energy.
[2:00:56] &gt;&gt; I have been called as a son and daughter
[2:01:00] of the creator of heavens and earth.
[2:01:04] &gt;&gt; And he has sent me here with a divine
[2:01:08] purpose and by his grace I shall fill
[2:01:12] this race.
[2:01:19] &gt;&gt; Seize the moment.
[2:01:21] I'm not talking about another moment.
[2:01:23] I'm not talking about after church. I'm
[2:01:25] talking about this moment.
[2:01:28] &gt;&gt; Say, I sense the spirit of God.
[2:01:31] &gt;&gt; I sense the voice of God talking to me.
[2:01:35] Seize the moment.
[2:01:37] &gt;&gt; Whatever you do, don't let it bypass
[2:01:39] you.
[2:01:40] &gt;&gt; Say, well, enter. He say, how do I seize
[2:01:42] the moment? Enter into it. Oh, God,
[2:01:45] don't let this bypass me now. I'm here
[2:01:48] to receive it. I'm here. Whatever I need
[2:01:51] to do. Whatever I need to do, oh God.
[2:01:54] But keep speaking. Speak on.
[2:01:59] [Music]
[2:02:04] &gt;&gt; Some of you been struggling. You're
[2:02:06] struggling with the world or struggling
[2:02:08] with the enemy, struggling with Satan.
[2:02:10] You need to change that now.
[2:02:15] &gt;&gt; Seize a moment. Amen.
[2:02:19] &gt;&gt; See some of you young people.
[2:02:27] I remember
[2:02:29] going to church
[2:02:31] when I was younger than you fellas
[2:02:37] and I used to sing a song as a little
[2:02:40] boy and they'd have me stand up and sing
[2:02:42] in church or in a meeting.
[2:02:46] Oh, there's honey in the rock, my
[2:02:48] brother. There's honey in the rock for
[2:02:51] you.
[2:02:53] Leave your sins for the blood to cover.
[2:02:58] There's honey in the rock for you. How
[2:03:02] old were you, brother Ed? I was about
[2:03:05] four and a half.
[2:03:10] And I sang it then and I can still sing
[2:03:13] it today
[2:03:14] &gt;&gt; because it's exactly the truth.
[2:03:18] &gt;&gt; And I found there was honey in a rock as
[2:03:20] a boy. And that's why Eugene,
[2:03:25] your words meant something to me because
[2:03:27] I was studying this subject. I looked to
[2:03:29] my grandfather when I was a lad, when I
[2:03:32] was just a boy,
[2:03:35] and I said, "Thank God."
[2:03:37] He didn't know anything about the
[2:03:39] message, but he seized the hour. He
[2:03:41] seized the moment. Even under the
[2:03:43] communism and under the persecution,
[2:03:46] there was men who stood
[2:03:48] &gt;&gt; and would not be moved for God.
[2:03:51] &gt;&gt; Listen to me, friends. This this world
[2:03:54] that you're living in, you're going to
[2:03:55] go to your home. This world you're
[2:03:58] living in, this Bible says, shall wax
[2:04:01] worse
[2:04:03] &gt;&gt; and what?
[2:04:04] &gt;&gt; Worse.
[2:04:05] &gt;&gt; And what? Worse.
[2:04:07] &gt;&gt; Do you kids hear that? And worse.
[2:04:10] &gt;&gt; Not better or worse. Not because I'm
[2:04:12] saying it. That's what this says it.
[2:04:15] &gt;&gt; He who created all things, he knows what
[2:04:17] the future's going to be. It's going to
[2:04:19] get worse and worse.
[2:04:31] &gt;&gt; I want to show you this next.
[2:04:34] Here's
[2:04:38] a diagram.
[2:04:42] Can we turn the lights down just a wee
[2:04:44] bit? Here's a diagram
[2:04:47] that scientists, a leading scientist by
[2:04:50] the name of
[2:04:52] McTagert.
[2:04:55] They proposed that the passage of time
[2:04:58] is is an illusion suggesting that only
[2:05:00] the present is real.
[2:05:04] You say, "Well, tomorrow I'm going to do
[2:05:06] this or tomorrow. Tomorrow, tomorrow."
[2:05:09] You don't have any tomorrow. You don't
[2:05:11] know about tomorrow.
[2:05:14] You can only anticipate tomorrow.
[2:05:17] I'm going to do this. And then you
[2:05:19] project that because you you pulling
[2:05:21] from your memory. That's how you do it.
[2:05:24] Tomorrow I'm going to get in my car
[2:05:26] tomorrow. You only know that because you
[2:05:28] got in your car before, but it's an
[2:05:30] illusion.
[2:05:32] you anticipate it and we don't we don't
[2:05:36] want to take anybody's expectations away
[2:05:38] but this is what science has said
[2:05:43] that the past
[2:05:47] here we have the past
[2:05:50] and here we have the future but here
[2:05:52] this little moment this little red arrow
[2:05:56] right up the middle
[2:06:00] that's you in church Today
[2:06:03] you have this moment.
[2:06:06] This is the only moment that's actually
[2:06:08] real.
[2:06:10] And what's last week in the last service
[2:06:13] in the last camp and that's why things
[2:06:15] at camp and special meetings and
[2:06:17] everything because people sit and they
[2:06:20] kind of you know the way it was back
[2:06:22] there and you kind of draw that back.
[2:06:25] Sorry folks that was that moment.
[2:06:29] &gt;&gt; This is another one. Amen.
[2:06:34] &gt;&gt; And you can dream all you want and you
[2:06:36] can think and you can anticipate and you
[2:06:38] can try and you know to have that once
[2:06:40] again I'm sorry that's is gone
[2:06:43] &gt;&gt; and as as time goes on as we know it as
[2:06:46] as this motion of life continues that
[2:06:49] goes further into the past
[2:06:51] &gt;&gt; and the present and the and and the and
[2:06:54] the present you're living at just now
[2:06:55] but the future this afternoon is is
[2:06:58] moving up to us and this will go further
[2:07:00] into the past.
[2:07:02] &gt;&gt; Now, in God's economy, if we do what
[2:07:05] we're supposed to do at this moment,
[2:07:08] and if we have a future, if we have
[2:07:10] tonight, and we have the communion, and
[2:07:12] we have the Lord's table, that can even
[2:07:15] be that much more blessed because we
[2:07:17] say, "Oh, I'm going to seize this
[2:07:20] moment.
[2:07:22] &gt;&gt; I got this moment. I can wash our
[2:07:24] sister's feet. I got this moment. I can
[2:07:26] wash this brother's feet. I got this
[2:07:29] moment that God has given me to to be
[2:07:32] even as Jesus as Jesus has said, uh, if
[2:07:36] you do these things, happy are you? Oh,
[2:07:40] and I have this moment.
[2:07:42] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:07:43] &gt;&gt; And somebody here may say, well, my
[2:07:46] preacher, my minister or someone on the
[2:07:48] internet, my preacher, our church
[2:07:50] doesn't do that. We're not interested
[2:07:52] what anybody's church does.
[2:07:56] We're not interested what anybody that's
[2:07:58] why we're not interested in what anybody
[2:08:00] thinks.
[2:08:02] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:08:02] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:08:04] &gt;&gt; You say, "Well, now you'll maybe realize
[2:08:07] why I spoke certain services." I hinge
[2:08:10] everything on that vindication.
[2:08:13] &gt;&gt; And here we have in the in in the
[2:08:14] message influence in Tulair. Tulair,
[2:08:18] California is that service. And if you
[2:08:21] want to read it and it comes to the end,
[2:08:23] you want to hear it even better. Hear
[2:08:25] it. And it comes to the end of the
[2:08:27] service. And then and and can you
[2:08:30] imagine?
[2:08:32] Can you imagine where this generation
[2:08:34] has gone? Elijah and Jesus Christ, the
[2:08:38] pillar of fire,
[2:08:40] &gt;&gt; standing in front of those people
[2:08:43] &gt;&gt; and can't move them.
[2:08:52] And they came two 300
[2:08:55] 100 150 200 came and packed the altar.
[2:08:59] What did they get, brother Ed? I don't
[2:09:01] know.
[2:09:04] I I'm not too sure what they got.
[2:09:07] They should have seized the moment.
[2:09:11] &gt;&gt; They should have been able to say
[2:09:12] earlier, never a man's fake like this
[2:09:15] man.
[2:09:18] But there's women there who cut their
[2:09:20] hair and they resisted it cuz they cut.
[2:09:22] Can you imagine making hair that
[2:09:25] important
[2:09:30] &gt;&gt; and letting that stand in the way?
[2:09:33] &gt;&gt; Friends, are you with me? Am I
[2:09:41] &gt;&gt; We have this moment
[2:09:47] They've said just as a matter of
[2:09:50] explanation, I'm going to finish in just
[2:09:52] a couple few minutes. Now,
[2:09:55] they've likened the future to or the the
[2:09:58] past to recorded messages. We've already
[2:10:01] recorded it. I have a reason for saying
[2:10:04] this. It's already recorded
[2:10:07] and we got it on a recording someplace.
[2:10:10] And the future's like a blank tape or
[2:10:12] blank CD.
[2:10:14] And we're going to put that in
[2:10:16] infotismal needle there
[2:10:20] on the CD
[2:10:22] to catch
[2:10:25] the moment
[2:10:27] and record it and it goes into the past
[2:10:30] cuz now we've recorded it's gone back
[2:10:33] your life.
[2:10:36] There's a needle in your life
[2:10:39] &gt;&gt; and you are recording. And Jesus Christ
[2:10:43] whose yesterday, today, and forever has
[2:10:45] said that our lives are recorded in
[2:10:49] heaven.
[2:10:50] &gt;&gt; Everything's recorded. Oh my friends, I
[2:10:54] could start now and start preaching. How
[2:10:56] wonderful it was that we have a a
[2:10:59] playing head that recorded everything,
[2:11:02] but we also have a a perfect delete
[2:11:06] button.
[2:11:07] &gt;&gt; We have a perfect redemption
[2:11:10] &gt;&gt; because the purpose the purpose of our
[2:11:13] lives here. Please get it. I'm this as
[2:11:16] deep as I can get with my my thoughts to
[2:11:18] you. But the purpose of the purpose of
[2:11:21] all these events from the beginning to
[2:11:24] the very end is a series and God put
[2:11:27] lights in the heavens light for the sun.
[2:11:31] So we have hours, days, weeks, years,
[2:11:33] etc., etc. But God keeps it by this is
[2:11:37] the era, season of this manifestation.
[2:11:40] Then there's another one. And during
[2:11:42] this time, he raises up people that can
[2:11:45] manifest what he has determined shall be
[2:11:48] manifested in that season.
[2:11:52] &gt;&gt; I'm I'm telling you friends, in the name
[2:11:54] of the Lord Jesus Christ and in
[2:11:56] opposition to every demon power that
[2:11:59] would be opposed, Satan hates the
[2:12:01] expression of Jesus Christ.
[2:12:05] He hates to see his enemy expressed in
[2:12:09] his power.
[2:12:11] &gt;&gt; And God set you here so that you could
[2:12:14] demonstrate it.
[2:12:16] &gt;&gt; Don't live like some weak need so-called
[2:12:19] Christian. We're more than that.
[2:12:25] [Applause]
[2:12:25] [Music]
[2:12:27] &gt;&gt; We're not here to wallow around in
[2:12:29] Leodysia. We're here to say, "My vision
[2:12:32] is clear.
[2:12:35] My call is clear.
[2:12:38] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:12:39] &gt;&gt; My dedication is clear.
[2:12:42] &gt;&gt; I've given myself entirely to this word.
[2:12:50] &gt;&gt; I'm not Elijah. I'm not a prophet or a
[2:12:52] son of a prophet. But I have a prophet's
[2:12:55] message.
[2:12:56] &gt;&gt; And you have the same message. You can
[2:12:58] live it as you can live it as God has
[2:13:01] called you to live it. And you shall do
[2:13:03] so because God will not be God's program
[2:13:07] will not be foiled. It will not be
[2:13:10] distracted. It will not be derailed.
[2:13:13] He's going to achieve his purpose.
[2:13:18] &gt;&gt; And I can tell you friends what's
[2:13:20] deepened my soul. We're not called here
[2:13:23] just to go to church on Sunday or just
[2:13:25] to go to church on Wednesday. We're
[2:13:27] called here to live this life in such a
[2:13:30] way
[2:13:48] I'm going to going to just finish with
[2:13:50] this.
[2:13:51] There's a man in the Bible.
[2:13:54] I think brother John Andy's has
[2:13:56] mentioned him. I'm not too sure.
[2:13:59] Somebody has. Maybe brother Tom Shamgar
[2:14:04] he's there's only one little scripture
[2:14:06] of him can I take this moment have your
[2:14:09] attention
[2:14:11] there's just one scripture of him
[2:14:14] doesn't say much about him but it says
[2:14:17] this and after him was Shamgar
[2:14:21] the son of Anith
[2:14:24] who slew the Philistines 600 men with an
[2:14:28] ox go an ox cross goat as a stick
[2:14:32] and he delivered
[2:14:35] he also delivered Israel.
[2:14:38] That's the verse about him.
[2:14:41] Brother Brandham he says the Philistines
[2:14:44] were coming
[2:14:47] and stealing their grain
[2:14:50] and leaving the children of Israel
[2:14:53] povertystricken.
[2:14:58] And Shamgar was a judge,
[2:15:02] but he was just an ordinary man. He
[2:15:04] says, "And here Shamgar," he says,
[2:15:06] "Let's see him now. He's probably
[2:15:07] standing in his barn."
[2:15:11] And, uh,
[2:15:14] he says, uh, he's had a pretty good crop
[2:15:16] this year.
[2:15:19] And the and the grain is the grainery is
[2:15:22] full in the barn. And he's happy. He's
[2:15:26] thanking God
[2:15:28] for the crop they had. And he hears
[2:15:30] thump thump thump thump thump thump. And
[2:15:34] hear the clang of the of the shields.
[2:15:38] Thump thump. 600 men coming or maybe
[2:15:42] more.
[2:15:44] And he's got a little family says little
[2:15:46] ragged kids around him. He's thinking,
[2:15:50] "Here they come again.
[2:15:52] Here they come.
[2:15:55] But he says
[2:15:57] he didn't have time to go and learn how.
[2:16:03] &gt;&gt; He says it almost every time. He didn't
[2:16:05] have time to go and get practiced up.
[2:16:07] &gt;&gt; He didn't have time to learn how to be a
[2:16:10] warrior.
[2:16:12] &gt;&gt; Some of you say, "Well, I I some of you
[2:16:14] younger people might say, "Well, when I
[2:16:16] get a little older, when I when I'm
[2:16:18] finished this, when I'm finished that,
[2:16:19] there are there are times in God's
[2:16:21] economy there isn't time Right.
[2:16:28] &gt;&gt; Says he didn't have time. He looked
[2:16:30] around and here they're coming and he
[2:16:32] looked around and all there was was an
[2:16:34] ox gold. He says a a stick with a maybe
[2:16:37] a brass end on it and and they might use
[2:16:39] it to push the dirt out from between the
[2:16:42] discs or the implement in the field. And
[2:16:45] he took that. He didn't have time, but
[2:16:47] he says, "I'm a Jew.
[2:16:50] &gt;&gt; I'm circumcised.
[2:16:52] I'm one of God's children.
[2:16:55] &gt;&gt; He didn't he he didn't say I'm a king
[2:16:57] and I'm a preacher and I'm a prophet or
[2:16:59] I'm something else. He's like one of
[2:17:01] you.
[2:17:03] &gt;&gt; That's who I am.
[2:17:05] &gt;&gt; I'm a mother.
[2:17:08] &gt;&gt; Come on, folks.
[2:17:09] &gt;&gt; I'm a father.
[2:17:11] &gt;&gt; I'm a believer.
[2:17:13] &gt;&gt; I heard this message. We don't go down
[2:17:16] say, "Well, maybe I'm not where I ought
[2:17:17] to be." That's not that's not the point
[2:17:20] here. The enemy is coming.
[2:17:22] &gt;&gt; And let me tell you something, friend.
[2:17:23] The enemy comes to church.
[2:17:26] &gt;&gt; And he'd like you to miss this moment.
[2:17:29] &gt;&gt; And you got a little preacher up here
[2:17:31] saying, "Size a moment. I don't care how
[2:17:33] old you are. I don't care how young you
[2:17:35] are. Don't lose this minute.
[2:17:40] &gt;&gt; This is the only time you have.
[2:17:42] &gt;&gt; You don't have tomorrow.
[2:17:45] &gt;&gt; You certainly don't have yesterday. and
[2:17:48] you haven't got next Sunday's meeting.
[2:17:50] What do you have? You have this moment.
[2:17:55] This moment's being recorded. You might
[2:17:58] be called on say, "Well, I need to do
[2:18:00] something I never did before."
[2:18:02] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:18:03] &gt;&gt; That'd be perfectly fine. Oh, God. I'm
[2:18:06] not going to let this moment go.
[2:18:12] &gt;&gt; You're speaking to me. You spoken in my
[2:18:15] heart. Things cannot continue as they
[2:18:18] have.
[2:18:21] &gt;&gt; How many of you want to say that? Things
[2:18:23] must not continue as they have.
[2:18:29] &gt;&gt; I'm looking at you.
[2:18:32] &gt;&gt; It's a Shamgar.
[2:18:34] &gt;&gt; Oh, he said he wanted to meet him. He
[2:18:37] what a bold little fellow. And he took
[2:18:40] that ox code and he just began to beat.
[2:18:43] He didn't know how. He only knew one
[2:18:46] thing. He knew who he was. I'm a Jew.
[2:18:50] I'm circumcised.
[2:18:52] He says, "I'm the the God of Abraham is
[2:18:55] my God. The God of Isaac is my God and I
[2:18:59] stand there."
[2:19:02] &gt;&gt; I say to this congregation, in the name
[2:19:04] of Jesus Christ, I don't intend to
[2:19:07] preach this message again here, but I
[2:19:10] say seize a moment.
[2:19:11] &gt;&gt; Amen. Hey, Shamgar sees the moment.
[2:19:14] Amen.
[2:19:18] &gt;&gt; I'll say to every person here as a
[2:19:20] testimony and everyone on the internet
[2:19:23] that should hear this service,
[2:19:25] whatever your dilemma is, whatever
[2:19:28] you're faced with,
[2:19:30] &gt;&gt; God wants you to get your vision and
[2:19:32] your eyes off of it
[2:19:35] &gt;&gt; and get your eyes off of the problem and
[2:19:37] get your eyes onto the promise
[2:19:40] &gt;&gt; and you go out of here and say, "This is
[2:19:42] what God has said."
[2:19:43] &gt;&gt; Amen. And whether I live or die, this is
[2:19:45] what I will believe.
[2:19:47] &gt;&gt; And God has furthermore, he has sent and
[2:19:49] confirmed it over and over and over. And
[2:19:52] I say, Father, you did so much more than
[2:19:54] you needed to do.
[2:19:57] &gt;&gt; You did so much more.
[2:20:01] &gt;&gt; Why didn't they believe? I don't know.
[2:20:04] Why weren't they moved? Why didn't they
[2:20:06] seize the moment?
[2:20:10] &gt;&gt; This has the answer. This vindicated
[2:20:13] word has the answer.
[2:20:15] &gt;&gt; I say all glory to be the name of Jesus
[2:20:18] Christ. All hail King Jesus. All hail
[2:20:22] Emmanuel. Come brother
[2:20:27] Ryan and help me sing.
[2:20:30] Let's stand to our feet.
[2:20:34] And I don't care if you break
[2:20:37] from the ritual. I'm not interested in
[2:20:40] any ritual.
[2:20:42] I'm interested in I'm not interested
[2:20:44] even in closing this service the way we
[2:20:46] would always close it. There's a
[2:20:49] baptismal, isn't there, brother John and
[2:20:51] brother do brother Tom, maybe you and
[2:20:53] the people want to be baptized.
[2:20:56] What a moment.
[2:20:58] &gt;&gt; What a moment to seize
[2:21:01] those that are going to be baptized.
[2:21:05] What an atmosphere.
[2:21:09] Dear friends and believers,
[2:21:12] we have this moment and I think we ought
[2:21:14] to reach out.
[2:21:16] &gt;&gt; Maybe you've never raised your hand, but
[2:21:17] I think you ought to maybe raised your
[2:21:20] hand. At least listen to your heart and
[2:21:23] do what your heart is saying for you to
[2:21:25] do. Pray the kind of prayer your heart
[2:21:28] is saying. Hallelujah. Let it become a
[2:21:31] voice.
[2:21:33] Oh God, Father, I'm bringing this
[2:21:35] congregation before you. I'm bringing
[2:21:38] this service before you while we're here
[2:21:41] in this moment and we have this uh this
[2:21:44] little sliver of time to make this
[2:21:47] service, Lord, may it conclude the way
[2:21:49] you want it to conclude. May the
[2:21:52] individuals whose lives need to be
[2:21:54] touched, let them be touched. Oh God, I
[2:21:57] pray Father that you'll take control of
[2:22:00] the life of the service of the word of
[2:22:04] all the moments of this closing of the
[2:22:07] service and those that are going into
[2:22:09] the water to be baptized. Oh God, let
[2:22:14] your Holy Spirit fill them. Let them
[2:22:18] rise in a resurrection of newness of
[2:22:21] life in the name of Jesus Christ.
[2:22:25] In the name of Jesus Christ.
[2:22:28] Hallelujah.
[2:22:30] Hallelujah.
[2:22:36] I'd like to encourage you.
[2:22:41] Are you listening to your heart?
[2:22:44] What is the spirit of God saying to you?
[2:22:48] Would you like to say, "Yes, Lord."
[2:22:51] Lord,
[2:22:52] &gt;&gt; yes, Lord.
[2:22:54] Yes, Lord.
[2:22:58] [Music]
[2:23:00] They would change that. Speak my lord.
[2:23:04] When uh fire of
[2:23:08] touch the prophet.
[2:23:12] When the cool of fire touched the
[2:23:16] prophet
[2:23:19] making him as pure as pure can be.
[2:23:26] Then the voice of God said, "Go for us."
[2:23:33] Then he answered, "Here are my friend.
[2:23:40] Speak my Lord.
[2:23:45] Speak my Lord.
[2:23:50] Speak and I'll be equipped to answer
[2:23:54] thee.
[2:23:57] Sleep my Lord.
[2:24:01] See my Lord.
[2:24:07] Sing me and I will answer.
[2:24:11] Lord.
[2:24:16] &gt;&gt; Soon the time of reaping will be over.
[2:24:24] towards
[2:24:26] the harvest.
[2:24:30] May the Lord harvest smile upon us.
[2:24:37] May we hear his blessed child well done.
[2:24:42] How many want to hear that?
[2:24:45] &gt;&gt; Speak my lord.
[2:24:49] &gt;&gt; Speak my lord. Let us worship him now.
[2:24:54] Sweet man, I'll be
[2:24:58] answering.
[2:25:01] Speak my Lord.
[2:25:06] Speak my Lord.
[2:25:11] Speak and I will answer.
[2:25:16] Lord send me.
[2:25:19] &gt;&gt; I'm going to sing the chorus once more.
[2:25:22] [Music]
[2:25:24] And I sense that perhaps there are those
[2:25:26] that are saying,
[2:25:28] "Brother Ed, I'm just wondering how do I
[2:25:30] seize the moment? This is how."
[2:25:35] For every person that somewhere along in
[2:25:37] the service,
[2:25:40] you heard the voice of God
[2:25:44] speaking, maybe a still small voice
[2:25:47] speaking deep within.
[2:25:49] Then what you need to do, you just lift
[2:25:52] your hands and say, "Speak on, Lord.
[2:25:55] Speak on. Speak on. Don't don't cease.
[2:25:58] Don't stop. My heart is open. My ears
[2:26:01] are open. My soul is open. My heart is
[2:26:04] open. God, my mind is open. Speak on,
[2:26:07] Lord. Speak on. Speak on." Just lift
[2:26:11] your hands to him. And we'll sing it. We
[2:26:14] will sing it just quietly and
[2:26:15] prayerfully once again. Speak my Lord.
[2:26:18] speak my Lord and then you just let your
[2:26:21] voice, let your words, let your mouth be
[2:26:23] open. Don't be ashamed of him. Don't be
[2:26:27] ashamed of him. If that's him speaking
[2:26:29] to you, don't be ashamed. Yes, Lord.
[2:26:32] Yes, Lord. What is it that you'd have me
[2:26:34] to do? What would you have me to change?
[2:26:36] Oh, God. How many here? How many here
[2:26:40] will raise their hand and they sense
[2:26:42] that God has been speaking to them? I
[2:26:44] just have my hands up. I'm not looking
[2:26:46] around. Let let us sing it once again,
[2:26:49] brother Ryan, as a prayer. Now,
[2:26:51] everyone, speak my Lord.
[2:26:57] Speak my Lord.
[2:27:02] Speak and I'll
[2:27:06] answer.
[2:27:11] Speak my Lord.
[2:27:16] Speak my Lord.
[2:27:22] &gt;&gt; Speak and I will answer.
[2:27:26] [Music]
[2:27:30] &gt;&gt; With our hands still raised, our hearts
[2:27:32] open. Heavenly Father,
[2:27:36] I want to before this congregation of
[2:27:38] people, I want to thank you
[2:27:41] for having spoken to my own heart during
[2:27:45] the last days and the last few weeks,
[2:27:48] speaking in my own home, oh God, and I
[2:27:51] and my wife having opportunity to speak
[2:27:54] about the things that are so deep upon
[2:27:56] our hearts. I thank you, oh God, for
[2:27:59] every time you have moved in the past.
[2:28:02] But Lord Jesus, we're not living in the
[2:28:04] past. We're living in the now. I'm
[2:28:07] living in this very moment, oh God. And
[2:28:09] I just so desire or so hunger, Lord. I
[2:28:12] hunger for these people. I hunger that
[2:28:14] you will be such a reality to them. I
[2:28:17] pray, oh God, in the name, blessed name
[2:28:20] of my Lord Jesus Christ, I love thee,
[2:28:23] Lord. I love thee. I love you with all
[2:28:25] my soul. Oh God, may you be such a
[2:28:27] reality to these people. I pray, Father,
[2:28:30] let your presence fill her bosom, fill
[2:28:32] her heart, fill her life, fill her car,
[2:28:34] oh God, fill her home, Father,
[2:28:40] prevent it. Protect us against the
[2:28:43] spirit of this age. Protect us against
[2:28:46] the lukewarmness. Protect us against the
[2:28:50] world. Protect us, oh God.
[2:28:53] Let this congregation live as soldiers,
[2:28:57] true soldiers of the cross of Jesus
[2:29:00] Christ. I commit them to you. Thank you
[2:29:04] for their kind attention.
[2:29:08] In Jesus name.
[2:29:10] In Jesus name.
[2:29:13] Amen.
[2:29:14] You may be seated.
[2:29:16] Sorry, brother Tom.
[2:29:18] &gt;&gt; I want to live
[2:29:23] away.
[2:29:25] He wants me
[2:29:27] to live. I want to give
[2:29:32] until there's just no more to give. I
[2:29:39] want to love
[2:29:41] [Music]
[2:29:43] till there's just no more.
[2:29:49] rise together.
[2:29:53] [Music]
[2:30:00] Amen. That song has a significance to
[2:30:02] the very reason why we're standing here
[2:30:05] because I believe a couple,
[2:30:07] brother Mike Hoffer, Sister Ela Hoffer,
[2:30:10] they're seizing their opportunity.
[2:30:13] &gt;&gt; This is their time.
[2:30:15] &gt;&gt; They didn't want to let it go by another
[2:30:17] week. They didn't want to go back to
[2:30:18] South Dakota. They knew that they had to
[2:30:21] be together in the baptism, in the
[2:30:23] waters of baptism,
[2:30:25] &gt;&gt; knowing that God has done a great work
[2:30:26] within brother Mike's heart. Sister
[2:30:29] Elaine just rededicating her life as a
[2:30:31] family. I say, "Let's just seize the
[2:30:33] opportunity." And that's why we're in
[2:30:36] the in the baptismal thing. I thought,
[2:30:37] "What a perfect message, Brother Mike.
[2:30:40] &gt;&gt; What a perfect message.
[2:30:42] &gt;&gt; They weren't going to let a Sunday go
[2:30:44] by.
[2:30:46] I want to be identified in his death,
[2:30:49] burial, and resurrection.
[2:30:51] &gt;&gt; I want to be baptized before I take
[2:30:53] communion.
[2:30:54] &gt;&gt; I need God within my home.
[2:30:57] &gt;&gt; Brother Mike, you said something that
[2:30:58] touched me very deeply. You said you
[2:31:01] want to live that kind of life that you
[2:31:04] heard that prophet speak.
[2:31:09] &gt;&gt; I want to live that kind of life that he
[2:31:11] heard the prophet speak. Amen.
[2:31:14] &gt;&gt; And my mind immediately went to
[2:31:16] invisible union.
[2:31:19] &gt;&gt; Brother Bram says this, the anointed
[2:31:21] word of God being vindicated before any
[2:31:23] man that's born to be a son of God with
[2:31:27] the predestinated germ in him for his
[2:31:30] hour. He'll see God's message as sure as
[2:31:34] there's a God in heaven.
[2:31:36] &gt;&gt; I say praise be to God, brother Mike.
[2:31:39] There is that germ within you
[2:31:41] &gt;&gt; at this particular season
[2:31:45] that God was going to interrupt your
[2:31:47] life.
[2:31:48] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:31:50] &gt;&gt; He said the real genuine eagles hear my
[2:31:54] sheep know my voice and a stranger
[2:31:57] they'll not follow.
[2:31:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:32:02] &gt;&gt; Brother Bram goes on to say, and this is
[2:32:04] the part that I love. You saw a being
[2:32:07] you wanted to be like,
[2:32:10] &gt;&gt; a deep calling to a deep.
[2:32:14] &gt;&gt; He said, "Those hundred-year-old
[2:32:15] messages didn't do nothing for me in the
[2:32:17] colony.
[2:32:18] &gt;&gt; But when I heard a prophet minister,
[2:32:20] that's the kind of life I want."
[2:32:23] &gt;&gt; That is a gene calling out to God,
[2:32:26] seeing a being he wanted to be like. And
[2:32:29] you say, "Well, how do I get to be like
[2:32:31] that being?" You repent and be baptized
[2:32:33] in the name of Jesus Christ for the
[2:32:35] remission of your sins and you shall
[2:32:37] receive the gift of the Holy Ghost.
[2:32:39] Brother Mike.
[2:32:41] &gt;&gt; Amen. And you will be like that being by
[2:32:43] coming by the word of God.
[2:32:45] &gt;&gt; Sister Elaine, by your desire also of
[2:32:49] following in the word of God with your
[2:32:51] husband, rededicating your life to Jesus
[2:32:54] Christ. We will baptize you both in the
[2:32:58] name above all names.
[2:33:00] In the name of our Lord Jesus Christ,
[2:33:02] brother might the thing that you
[2:33:03] desired. Amen. Won't you just step
[2:33:05] forward here?
[2:33:08] Let's turn around this way. Would you
[2:33:10] like to say anything? Too nervous.
[2:33:13] &gt;&gt; Too nervous. All right.
[2:33:19] Our
[2:33:24] dear heavenly father,
[2:33:27] just sitting in a room just a few days
[2:33:29] ago and hearing brother Mike declaring
[2:33:33] Lord his love for you and how that
[2:33:35] you've turned his heart around that
[2:33:37] could only be the Holy Ghost himself
[2:33:40] speaking to a predestinated seed. I pray
[2:33:43] father as he has desired the very life
[2:33:46] of Jesus Christ that you will baptize
[2:33:48] him with the Holy Ghost and fire that
[2:33:51] Lord wherever you would lead his
[2:33:52] footsteps Lord that he would have the
[2:33:55] fire of God burning within his bones
[2:33:58] that he will testify that his life Lord
[2:34:00] will testify of the very presence of
[2:34:03] Jesus Christ the living word Lord we
[2:34:07] commit him into your divine care now in
[2:34:10] Jesus name and brother Tonight by your
[2:34:13] confession that Jesus Christ is your
[2:34:15] personal savior, I baptize you in true
[2:34:19] Christian baptism in the name of our
[2:34:22] Lord Jesus Christ. Amen.
[2:34:28] [Applause]
[2:34:39] Let's bow our heads in a word of prayer.
[2:34:46] What a marvelous thing it is, Lord,
[2:34:49] &gt;&gt; that you would take a husband and wife
[2:34:51] together to walk down this path of life.
[2:34:55] Lord,
[2:34:55] &gt;&gt; and sister Elaine, Lord, has spoken,
[2:34:57] Lord, she has a love for you. Always
[2:34:59] has. But
[2:35:01] &gt;&gt; God, I just pray now that as she is
[2:35:03] being baptized
[2:35:05] this morning in water that you would
[2:35:07] baptize her with the fire of the Holy
[2:35:10] Ghost. Yes,
[2:35:12] &gt;&gt; truly indeed. I can baptize her with
[2:35:14] water, but there's one greater than I.
[2:35:17] Let the dove come down and let the
[2:35:19] spirit of God consume her. Let her life,
[2:35:22] Lord,
[2:35:23] &gt;&gt; be blessed with your presence live in
[2:35:26] her. I pray, Sister Elaine, by your
[2:35:29] confession that Jesus Christ is your
[2:35:32] personal savior. I baptize you in true
[2:35:35] Christian baptism in the name of our
[2:35:37] Lord Jesus Christ. Amen.
[2:35:43] [Applause]
[2:35:56] talked about seizing the opportunity.
[2:35:59] We have one more.
[2:36:03] &gt;&gt; Flow through me.
[2:36:16] Glory.
[2:36:19] Holy Spirit.
[2:36:29] I
[2:36:32] to
[2:36:33] [Applause]
[2:36:34] [Music]
[2:36:35] [Applause]
[2:36:37] my
[2:36:39] name.
[2:36:40] [Music]
[2:36:52] We have brother David Fzen here
[2:36:55] and he actually I actually had it wrote
[2:36:57] down here. Brother David, the next
[2:37:00] baptism, we will seize the opportunity.
[2:37:04] &gt;&gt; I thought that was remarkable.
[2:37:06] &gt;&gt; And when I walked into church this
[2:37:07] morning, I said, "There will be a
[2:37:08] baptismal service this morning. Let's
[2:37:11] just seize this opportunity."
[2:37:13] &gt;&gt; And brother David was baptized as a
[2:37:15] young boy. And you know, we just want to
[2:37:17] put the we want to put the devil on the
[2:37:19] run.
[2:37:20] &gt;&gt; And it's been plaguing him for years the
[2:37:22] way that he was baptized. And so he just
[2:37:25] said, "I need to put it to rest, brother
[2:37:26] Tom. I need to stand in the waters of
[2:37:29] baptism. I want to go on with God and I
[2:37:32] want to put the devil and doubt behind
[2:37:33] me.
[2:37:34] &gt;&gt; Well, here's our time. God bless brother
[2:37:37] David for his boldness to stand before
[2:37:39] the people of God and to be identified
[2:37:42] with Jesus Christ.
[2:37:44] &gt;&gt; Amen. Brother David,
[2:37:46] you have a great desire to walk with
[2:37:48] God. Satan has plagued your mind these
[2:37:50] many years. But to put you at rest to
[2:37:54] know that there is a way that seems
[2:37:56] maybe right unto man. That's the way of
[2:37:58] death. But there is the right way, the
[2:38:00] correct way, God's way, the word way.
[2:38:03] And I know that's the way that you
[2:38:04] desire to walk. And so by your
[2:38:07] confession that Jesus Christ has been
[2:38:09] and is your personal savior, we baptize
[2:38:13] you in true Christian baptism in the
[2:38:16] name of our Lord Jesus Christ. Amen.
[2:38:29] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:38:38] &gt;&gt; Glory.
[2:38:40] &gt;&gt; You might as well smile with me. The
[2:38:42] devil's defeated.
[2:38:44] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:38:45] &gt;&gt; And God, our God is victorious.
[2:38:49] Hallelujah. He's so wonderful. Amen. I'm
[2:38:52] going to appeal to
[2:38:55] uh everyone in the congregation.
[2:38:59] We've u we we sent out the faith
[2:39:02] challenge report and we've gotten a a
[2:39:05] number back. People that moved and have
[2:39:08] got and I know especially like all you
[2:39:10] young people that are there's probably a
[2:39:12] hundred. Brother John told me about a
[2:39:14] hundred at the service Friday night. And
[2:39:17] I know that you must know somebody. You
[2:39:20] might know one, you might know two
[2:39:21] people you've met
[2:39:24] uh someplace wherever, another young
[2:39:26] person. They probably in all likelihood
[2:39:29] did not get a Faith John's report. This
[2:39:32] report is so outstanding. I just got a
[2:39:35] email from Singapore. I got an email
[2:39:38] from a brother and in fact is he's going
[2:39:41] to be ministering here. There's no
[2:39:43] service Wednesday. He'll be ministering
[2:39:46] Friday and Sunday, both services. And
[2:39:49] that's brother Joseph Hammed from
[2:39:51] Murphy'sboro.
[2:39:52] And he told me when he just saw those
[2:39:56] things, he said sent me an email. He
[2:39:58] says, "I'm in awe,
[2:40:00] just in awe at what is taking place and
[2:40:03] the people there that are working with
[2:40:05] brother Ivan, Brother Murphy's back now,
[2:40:07] and Sister Tracy and and other young
[2:40:10] people. We have three three of them.
[2:40:12] Sister Mary and two more came and are in
[2:40:15] the school, international students.
[2:40:17] We're so thankful. God bless them. But
[2:40:20] uh but you young people, I don't want to
[2:40:22] get away off of my thought. If you would
[2:40:24] just come forward and say, I have two or
[2:40:29] three people. I can send one of those
[2:40:31] two and I will take them and I'll just
[2:40:33] send it myself. You know the address and
[2:40:36] you send them. You can get them at the
[2:40:38] office. And I I I'd be I'd feel very
[2:40:42] very bad if there wasn't at least 30,
[2:40:43] 40, 50 people that would want to get a
[2:40:46] couple and send it to people that you
[2:40:48] know in all likelihood have not received
[2:40:52] it. And they ought to hear it. They
[2:40:54] shouldn't they hear that people that sat
[2:40:57] right here or brother Ivan, sister
[2:40:58] Aeneth has gone back to be with them
[2:41:00] because he can't he just can't he's so
[2:41:02] burdened he just can't get home. And
[2:41:05] they are correcting and changing and
[2:41:07] making this Bible will be the most
[2:41:09] accurate Bible China has ever had in
[2:41:14] their history.
[2:41:25] and you have a chance to just send out
[2:41:27] the notice that this is what's happening
[2:41:29] before you send it. If you haven't read
[2:41:31] it from back back to front, front to
[2:41:33] back, get it and read it and then send
[2:41:36] it out to some people. And I'm I'm
[2:41:39] appealing to you now because we've sent
[2:41:40] it out and a bunch have been returned
[2:41:43] and so we have extras now. And I know
[2:41:45] that there are people that have not
[2:41:47] heard and they want to hear. They want
[2:41:49] to be a part of it. God bless you. Let's
[2:41:51] stand and let's just sing. Blessed be
[2:41:54] the tie that binds our hearts in
[2:41:58] Christian love.
[2:41:59] &gt;&gt; Do you feel that way?
[2:42:02] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. And we'll see you this
[2:42:05] evening. Lord willing for four or
[2:42:08] five:00 and then we'll have the Lord's
[2:42:10] table. Greet hand greet. Shake hands
[2:42:13] with one another as we sing blessed be
[2:42:15] the tithe that binds.
[2:42:19] Our
[2:42:24] hearts in Christ love
[2:42:30] the fellowship
[2:42:33] of men
[2:42:36] is light to have above
[2:42:42] before our father's throne.
[2:42:47] [Music]
[2:42:48] We hold our heart and prayers.
[2:42:54] Our fears, our hope, our
[2:42:59] want, our comforts, and our prayers.
[2:43:06] God bless you. You sat down. I'm
[2:43:08] dismissing you in Jesus name. You're all
[2:43:11] dismissed. We'll see you this evening.
[2:43:13] God bless you.
[2:43:28] [Music]
