TRANSCRIPT
========================================
There was something on the little child's heart and said, "I really want to do something for for God, something for Christ." And he emptied emptied his piggy bank, $60. Every year we think, well, what can we do? What can be a good missions project for our school? We will run, walk, rollerblade, scooter, whatever way we can get there. We're going to get to Monterey, Mexico. We ran over 4,600 km. Through that, we were able to raise well over $700. I think our number right now is what? 800 and growing. &gt;&gt; Greetings. I'm Brother Derek Paris of Bible Believers. And here with us today is Brother Randy Timberman's of Bible Waych Christian Academy. Brother Randy, nice to have you here with us. &gt;&gt; Thanks for having me, brother Derek. Appreciate &gt;&gt; you're the principal of the school, Bible Waych Christian Academy. That's correct. And uh in in what you're involved in with the school, being affiliated with the church, um missions comes up every once in a while. It's a discussion. It's something that the children are closely associated with the the church and wanting to get behind something in missions. So the Lord has laid certain things on your heart over the last couple of years and specifically this year. So, we'd like to hear a little bit about what you've experienced with um allowing the children to be able to participate in getting the message into the hands of the people around the world. &gt;&gt; Absolutely. Well, uh at Bible Way Christian Academy, um we've been fortunate enough to have just some some wonderful people around us, uh wonderful teachers, and also because the school uh operates in in our church building, uh we're also surrounded by ministry and and fine brothers such as brother Derek uh in the missions department. um as a school uh an actual certified school in British Columbia, there are certain requirements that we have as far as education and curriculum, but um because of our unique position that we are a method school, we're able to uh integrate &gt;&gt; into our into our coursework uh you know, things of Christ and uh every year uh we try to do something very special um where the kids have an opportunity to give back to the Lord because the Lord's been so good to us in our school and uh through consultation with the with the missions department here at Cloverville, by the way. And um we've had the opportunity to do some really interesting and unique uh uh missions projects to uh to be a blessing. A lot of our children uh they want to do something for the Lord. They're young. They're they're five, six, seven and the in the early grades all the way up to to 15 years old, but each one wants to do their part for the Lord and they know that, you know, truly a blessing comes from giving. And so what we've done in the past is um every year we like to do at least one major missions project. And if I think back a few years ago, we uh we sent some care packages to to Russia and Ukraine for some orphan children there. And the children really enjoyed doing that. Just being able to select some things like toothpaste and and little games and and just things that we take for granted here in North America. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Certain little things that the orphan children in Ukraine wouldn't have and Russia wouldn't have. And we know those those things have really really blessed those children. Um I think it was last year um talking with brother Derek we we uh raised some money for Bibles for India. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; And I think it was about 500 500 Bibles we purchased. &gt;&gt; Yes it was &gt;&gt; somewhere some somewhere in that vicinity. And uh the children felt so blessed that they had done something to further the spread of the gospel to further the spread of Christianity uh in a nation such as such as India. And I'm always amazed at how these children they are so incredibly generous. Uh a little story I have of a child in uh in grade three um had about $60 saved in his in his piggy bank and uh we always make sure that the children ask their parents first, &gt;&gt; right? Right. So he asks there was something on the little child's heart said I really want to do something for for God something for Christ and he emptied emptied his piggy bank $60 and gave it to the school to give to the missions proh project last year which was Bibles for India &gt;&gt; and um but this year uh should we go into that brother Derek talk about the the message hub? &gt;&gt; Well I think it would be great u there's a great testimony that comes out of that. &gt;&gt; Sure. Uh this year um through through the the whole missions department here at at the church um we've been doing a they've been working on the whole message hub and so we every year we think well what can we do what can be a good missions project for our school and for our children something they'll really get behind so they can do their little part and I think it's important for the young students for young children to feel like they're doing something. Um, and I try to often tell them in devotions that, you know, whether your part's little, uh, you can give 25 cents, a dollar, uh, those monies can be so beneficial to the bride of Christ by purchasing things that will help, uh, ministry around the world, uh, and different and different different people. But this year um just by being in and about the church and seeing the work of the message hub and hearing reports from from different brothers about what a blessing these message hubs have been in different countries around the world and the teachers and myself and the students thought we do something with message hub and uh through consultation with yourself brother Derek we realized we need to raise around 700 or so dollars right &gt;&gt; to purchase a message hub print station and we were excited about that we thought what a terrific idea so what we've done essentially is um we decided to actually run to Monterey, Mexico. Now, it's not really physically possible for us to do that, but a part of the British Columbia uh education curriculum is that each student in British Columbia is required to do 30 minutes of daily physical activity, supervised daily physical activity. So, we thought, how can we somehow incorporate and integrate our daily physical activity with doing something for for the Lord and for getting this this print station in Monterey, Mexico. So what we decided to do through the help of some teachers here at the school is we decided we will run, walk, rollerblade, scooter, whatever way we can get there, we're going to get to Monterey, Mexico. So we actually in effect through the last 4 months we would chart every day how far we walked, ran, scootered, some of the children sprinted u and we ran over 4,600 km which brought us to Monterey, Mexico &gt;&gt; in just several months. Yeah. So, we started around late September and right around Christmas time, uh, Decemberish, we arrived, &gt;&gt; so to speak, in Monterey, Mexico, and that was our goal to get there. Now, while we were running, we were, uh, we were holding little events at our school, uh, you know, special days, like a hat day or wear your jeans day, and then we just had basically days where they could just donate to the to the to the fund, the message hub fund. And, uh, through that, we were able to raise well over $700. I think our number right now is what 800 and growing. So, we're just going to keep it going and maybe we can even get two hubs. We'll see what the Lord has. The children have been so generous and it was it was kind of a really nice momentous event where we crossed that finish line and we realized that we had actually gone to Monterey, Mexico uh travel those 4,600 km and uh we're looking forward to presenting you, brother Derek, with with those monies so that we can uh officially pay for that message hub and see it blessing the the saints in Monterey. &gt;&gt; Well, I know the saints in Monterey are very excited. Pastor Australia, we've received an email from him and they will be blessed by being able to print &gt;&gt; messages directly from the message hub in their own language. Well, we appreciate your time today. We appreciate all that Bible Christian Academy does to support the missions work around the world and we look forward to next year's project, brother. &gt;&gt; Absolutely. We're excited about it and you know, like I said, it's such a blessing. It's a blessing to give. Absolutely. And the children, they get so much from it and it's a really good educational experience as well for them to see where the saints are around the world. Well, I don't want to put you on the spot, brother Randy, but uh next year's right around the corner. Can you tell us what uh what you might have coming for us next year? &gt;&gt; Oh, we we have to keep that a secret, I think, for now because we're we're not 100% sure. &gt;&gt; All right. &gt;&gt; But we just pray about it and we'll see if the Lord lays something on our heart and uh we're looking forward to though cuz we want to be a blessing to the bride of Christ. &gt;&gt; Well, we appreciate it. Thanks. &gt;&gt; God bless you. We look forward till we see you next time. [Music] Heat. Heat. [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] and let the world around me. and fail.

And we were on we were out with some folks and they had a hockey game going and you know it was there was a bunch of people walk watching it. But you know, if you go to that hockey game, those people, they're insane, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; Cuz they're worshiping their God. You know, they said, "Well, you know, Brother Rod, some of those guys, you know, they may be drinking and they kind of let some loose up." Well, you're supposed to be drinking the new wine. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. There shouldn't be nothing holding you back here. &gt;&gt; Amen. Great joy.

I remember an evening at camp and brother Ed stood up and said, "I give you your families. Stand up and claim it." I'm so thankful for that. &gt;&gt; Amen. And uh I can't understand some parents don't seem to care about their kids. It's just bizarre, you know, and they'll blacks slide and go into the world and not thinking they'll have any impact on their kids, right? Just totally destroys a family. I am so thankful. &gt;&gt; God's grace. So, let's sing this song this morning and uh just worship God as brother Bisll comes. [Music] Father of life, seated on your throne of grace.

God's heard us. &gt;&gt; God's answered our prayers so many times. &gt;&gt; We have evidence of it here today. Amen. So good to see our brother Ed Nikaroo. Hasn't been here for a few weeks. doctors &gt;&gt; and more doctors and specialists and more specialists and hospitals and another hospital and they can't find what the problem is. But we have a great physician and our our prophet has said that when man and all of his wisdom when he runs out that's just where God starts. Brother Ed, it's so wonderful to have you here today. There's a man that Hallelujah. There's a man that's been eaten up with fever for weeks and they could never find out why, how, what it was. Could never identify it. But God identified it. I think of so many times even the prophet would say to someone that's standing in front of him that the doctors couldn't find it &gt;&gt; but he announced you devil you can't hide &gt;&gt; from God &gt;&gt; hallelujah &gt;&gt; he couldn't hide from God brother Ed and brought you out walking into the into the church and saw brother Jim Weber standing also uh I rejoice that God is able to uh prove that there's nothing he can use a doctor, but he's he's the only one that can heal the body. So, we're thankful for that healing so so much. And uh we had a a request from Sister Buffy Gonzalez for her grandfather's been given just a few weeks to live from cancer. I know nothing more about it, but his name is Art Godfeed. And if you'd like to all stand, we're going to just go to prayer. I'd like to just sing God is so good. God is so good. Just before we go to prayer, Brother Rod, please. &gt;&gt; Let's just worship him now again. &gt;&gt; My God, God is so good. Oh, God is so good. He is so good to me. He saved my soul and he set my spirit free. [Music] my broken heart. He's so good to me. [Music] &gt;&gt; Heavenly Father, receive our thanksgiving. I'm going on notice to thank you, oh God, for your grace, compassion, and mercy, for your healing power, your virtue that has come to the bodies of the needy ones. We see different ones that are standing in the congregation today, knowing that a short time ago, they were not well. They were even beyond the doctor's diagnosis, but not beyond yours. Thank you for your glorious power that has been manifested amongst us. We thank you for the strength and the courage, oh God, that you have given to your people. And we stand here, the bloodwashed by the blood of Jesus Christ. We can truly say with a songwriter, there's a fountain filled with blood drawn from Emanuel's veins. Sinners plunge beneath the flood and lose all their guilty stains. Glory, glory, hallelujah to the lamb of God. We're here to praise and worship you. Thank you, Father, for watching over us while we were away and bringing us home. Thank you for the prayers that have been prayed. And we pray, oh God, for Sister Buffy's grandfather. And I pray, oh God, that as you look upon her heart today, and those that are praying for this man, that you'll see the his soul, Lord, and see his body. And I pray that you will cause the cancer cells to leave him, Father. We ask that this will be done for your glory and your glory alone. And now, dear Lord, for your word as we are soon approaching it, I pray that you will anoint the word, the speaker and the hearers and all of those that are with us today, oh father, from uh different parts of the world where they may be listening. I pray that you'll see the desire that's on their heart. And I ask that you'll bring it about and bring answers, oh God, as faith reaches out to you now to lay hold of the promise in the name of Jesus Christ. We thank you. Amen. Amen. And the people said, "Amen." I'm going to allow you to have your seats for a few more moments before we read the word because uh we have a few slides. Also, we want to show you uh of the work in in Moscow, the progress of the church, which we just received some of these slides just a few days ago. But even before we show you the slides, I would like to honor our mothers. It's a mother's day, but the brother brother Brandham said we should honor them every day of the year, not just on Mother's Day. But I think if we're, you know, uh there's nothing wrong with having a a time when we give some special uh attention. We give some special notice and appreciation for our mothers. They're prophet said they're the backbone of the nation. They're the hub of the home. And I I would hesitate to think what some of our young people would be if we didn't have the kind of mothers that we have sitting in the congregation today. And so I say to all of you mothers, God bless you. Do not be discouraged. uh things don't always go just the way we plan it to go and life as uh the prophet's mother even said it's all just part of the wheel you know it's all just part of the part of life and uh brother Brandham was standing by our bedside and saying we've broken your heart many times and so on said that's just all part of it that's part of life but in spite of in spite of the reversals or disappoint appointments or whatever more. There's one thing that is certain uh that God has raised up the office of mothers and and I want mothers to know today of course of fathers as well but mothers especially I want you to know that there is a special strength there's a special uh characteristic that God has imparted to you and never never back down from that special place that God has given to you in the home, in the community, in this church. And I just want to say God bless you abundantly. Amen. All right. I'd like to just show you these uh slides. Now, we have we, as you know, we've been supporting this work very much. This This is the little building that they moved out of in Moscow and it got burned down. Uh, that's one shot. There's another shot of it. So, I'm glad that we're able to show you the next pictures because they wouldn't have had much. There's the building that is they decided to put the second when we we made uh mention here that if they could if they could get about six more truckloads of concrete blocks, they'd go up another story. And that's what they've done. Uh so that they'll have almost like double the space. And I think that was a very good move about $18,000. Put that second floor on. Uh the some of the brothers from Ria Latvia are going there I believe next week to put the roof on. So we're very very thankful for that. That's the inside. The uh lumber that you see down here in in the right hand corner is for the trusses. So they have the material for the trusses. That is it there. And uh this is the going to be the main entrance into the sanctuary. Another look at the inside. And that's that's it. But I thought we'd like to show you they they're doing almost all the work themselves. Uh they're paying for very very little of the work. And we have now, I believe, sent a little over $70,000. They put about 80,000 of their own money in. They bought the land and uh I expect the Lord willing before the snow flies this season, they'll be in there fellowshipping and worshiping. Amen. And uh we're in fact as we have some more funds that came in and we're going to be sending them on uh Lord willing on Tuesday this week. So we're very happy for that. Thank you for your prayers for the meetings in Switzerland and uh of course uh this evening service for them. So they those that stream they gather and I just want to greet them because uh we indeed had a wonderful time and I want to thank them for the uh for the invitation that they they gave. It was a bit of a surprise and and a sovereign move of God I believe. Uh in fact, as I'm absolutely convinced, it was a sovereign move of God. Uh the the two brothers, very very fine uh brothers that put it on took it on their hearts to arrange the meeting just so that believers that were scattered to different places could come. One was brother Daniel Culen Bruner and uh brother David Mayer. These brothers, they took it on themselves just to find a place, which they did. They located a place. They had had a similar meeting maybe a couple of years ago and invited a couple brothers, brother Gido from Belgium and brother uh Frank Kronite from which I believe are well known to the Dross family and he sends his greetings to you as well. and they had invited him so uh I think a year or two ago and I had never met brother Kankite just this time. Uh but they had about 60 people that gathered from different places and uh so this time they had gotten a building and a kind of a convention center where the people could have rooms and have their meals and then have a a a meeting room at the same time. they have a lot of those places in Europe which we don't have so many of them here but uh they had about 60 people out and so they thought they even told me if we had maybe 60 70 people uh they thought that might be fine then it grew to 100 and 120 and then 160 and 180 and with the uh there was I think with the children there was around 200 or maybe 200 plus but it was uh different believers came from they came from France and Germany, Belgium and on the website they announced the meetings uh from our website and a a pastor, a Philippine pastor down in Milan, Italy saw the announcement and so he came up with eight or 10 of his people. There was a young man from Singapore who is studying and I think working in Germany and he saw the uh he saw the announcement and so he came and so people were gathering from different places but uh largely from the area in in Switzerland and there was a number of ministers besides uh brother Frank Kankite and brother Gido uh brother Jean Jacques uh you know we the church here along with saints from many different places. Prayed for our brother John Jacques. He was struck down about two weeks after we were there in October and uh with a a brain they didn't know whether it was a stroke or what it was but it turned out to be menitis in a fluid around his brain. There was a nurse in these meetings and there's medical people here but that registered nurse told us that with a menenitis in the fluid if there has a fluid around the brain said that first that is a certain death and secondly that fluid cannot dissipate in the body with the menitis that type of fluid and it did both. He lived and the and the flu is gone and he stands up and preaches today. So we're thankful to God for that. Amen. Brother France Leakard that's known to many of you here. He wants to send his greetings and be remembered to you. And he was in the meetings along with brother Coulen Bruner and uh from Germany and brother Albert. He brother Albert took the church of brother von Heath who is the grandfather of our our brother Nathaniel I IO and then his brother David who's been ordained to the ministry was also there and the pastor from Milan Italy and I don't have his name but we're we're just thankful for these brothers the I guess the outstanding thing I could probably just tell you I received this email just a few minutes before I left the home this morning and uh it was from brother Daniel Cen Bruner who was uh one of the brothers who was doing a lot of the uh took the responsibility of setting up and incidentally uh they they were they just cast all caution to the wind said whatever whatever it takes whatever it costs we're just going to see this gathering happening we believe that it is of the Lord and uh He said, "We would like to take this opportunity to thank you from the bottom of our hearts for the burden that you had to come to the meetings in Switzerland. We have no words to express our thankfulness to what the Lord has done to us. It looks like the bride is going back into steps singing onward Christian soldiers. Never have I been at a convention with people coming from so many different groups and at the same time there was just such a unity between the believers only the true word of God inspired by him is able to unite us. Amen. And so we're so thankful. He said, "Sometimes in life there are milestones where you really know that you have met God and he is in control of everything. We now move on with what we have received in our hearts believing that God will continue to reveal himself to us. Amen." And so you're a part of that if you prayed uh and uh ascending us. Brother Milco was there. We were so happy to have him and uh to mingle with the people. Our daughter Linda came with us partly to look after my wife, but more than that, there were so many young mothers that were there and she was able to be with them throughout the daytime because you weren't going anywhere. You're you were staying right there. And she thought it was just so wonderful cuz these mothers, they they had monitors, you know, so they could hear their their children and their babies. And they actually took their children and locked them in a room and and they were they'd be there just weeping and rejoicing. Then they'd grab a monitor and listen to see if everything was okay. But it seemed that God put a spirit of sleep on their kids. And uh and they were able they said, "We haven't been able to enjoy meetings like this." And this is just marvelous. And they all had their monitors laying in their laps and and had their children locked up in the rooms or in a room and uh enjoyed the services immensely. And just one after the other just came and said and there was one phrase, we are so happy. And it's wonderful when God's people get happy. &gt;&gt; And I I trust that you're happy this morning. Thank you for your patience and this little time. If you'd stand with me, we're going to read some scripture in Matthew's Gospel, the 11th chapter, a short reading of just three verses. Matthew's Gospel, the 11th chapter, and starting with verse 25. Just one more time, we'll bow our heads. Dear Father God, your Holy Spirit is the author of this word and you have signed it and confirmed it. Now I pray that you will anoint us each one in the name of Jesus Christ. May the very thoughts of God sink down into the deep regions of our heart in Jesus name and for his glory. Amen. Amen. At that time Jesus answered and said, "I thank thee, oh Father, Lord of heaven and earth, because thou hast hid these things from the wise and prudent, and hast revealed them unto babes. Even so, Father, for so it seemed good in thy sight. All things are delivered unto me of my Father, and no man knoweth the Son, but the Father, neither knoweth any man the Father, save the Son, and he to whomsoever the Son will reveal him. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And we pray that that's what will take place in our lives. God bless you. As you have your seats, you might want to just keep your Bibles open. I'm going to just refer to another scripture, one that is well known to each of you and you'll need to follow very very carefully and cautiously I may say don't try to read too much between the lines but sometimes uh there are things that you know a pastor would like to bring to the people that we cannot become just as specific or definitive as we would like to be, but yet you feel that you you you must approach it at least. And so that's the way I feel this morning. I just want to approach something uh in the message that uh is is evident throughout the scripture. And uh the the title of my uh service which I really really struggled over is uh is quite revealing in in in the subject matter. I want to speak on from human knowledge to revelation. And I would like you to envision in your mind that there is a chasm. There is a there is a chasm. There's a a deep valley between human knowledge. And I want to say chasm because uh there's no way just to you know work your own way from human knowledge into revelation. There's a place where your human knowledge just ends. &gt;&gt; You run out of mental space. &gt;&gt; You run out of imagination won't do it. Nothing will do it. You just completely run out. And you know that there's something more. And how are you going to get over there? Well, I will just summarize it by saying you'll have to see what God has said in his word about what's over there. Then you will have to cast yourself unreservedly and believe the promise of God and trust that the Holy Spirit then will take by your faith, honor your faith and deliver you to the other side. That's revelation. &gt;&gt; And there's no other way that it can happen that I know of. And revelation is extremely important because we are a people that are in in anticipation of a rapture. And I can tell you, brother Brandham said himself that we scarcely have faith for healing. What about rapturing faith? And so I'm here today. I'm speaking on my own behalf. I want to live in in in such a fashion that I can be in not only in expectation of the rapture, but also uh hear the things that God sent through his messenger concerning the rapture. And I can tell you that for me some of the things are really quite mysterious. And so I want to uh just suggest that we uh approach it from that direction. Now Jesus, he asked uh Peter in uh in the 16th chapter of of Matthew and we know it so well. You won't have to read it because I'm just going to summarize it. But he asked uh the disciples, who do men say that I am? And some of them said that you're John the Baptist, uh Elias or Jeremiah or one of the other prophets. And then he asked the question, but who do you say that I am? Brother Brandham was also speaking this in 1964, which is a long ways, many years from the time Jesus said it. He said, "It's not enough." He said it it that wasn't the question uh who do who do others say that I am but he asked the second question then who do you say that I am? He said now it's not enough that he asked them back then. We can't just read it as an account of what what he asked them but he said now in 1964 it's today 1964 and I want to say it's in 2009 we need to also be approached by the same question. Who do you say that this is? &gt;&gt; Amen. So the greatest of all revelations because Peter finally said, "Thou art the Christ, the son of the living God." Now I I want to just have you bear in mind that Jesus had been with the disciples now maybe some between two and three years. So they knew him as a man. They ate together, perhaps slept in the same rooms or buildings or wherever. Uh participated in the miracles, uh delivered the food and the supernatural uh increase of the loaves and the fishes to the people, gathered up the remnants or the leftovers. Uh so they were a part of all of this and yet there was a mysterious part that they couldn't fully grasp. They couldn't fully It was that supernatural aspect of him. There was a uh something strange about him. He would say things and they couldn't quite grasp it and especially towards the end when he began to say that the son of man will be uh killed and and after 3 days he'll be raised again they couldn't grasp they couldn't understand that that's why they were still bewildered after the resurrection and I'll be coming to that also so the greatest of all the greatest of all revelations is is this that God reveals himself as he unveils himself because what what it was 100 years ago or 200 years ago or 50 years ago or even a month ago, revelation is a moving it's a moving target. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Revelation is a moving thing because it's a living thing. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. And so it's not just what he revealed or what we saw, you know, a year ago or a few months ago. We can see physical manifestations. People do see physical manifestations. We can actually hear the word of God, study the word of God, and get all the mechanics as it were in place. We can study times and we can study all of these things and we can even do the requirements of the word. Sisters can say, well, I'm going to be uh, you know, I'm going to be in moderation. I'm going to grow my hair and do it because it says so in the word. And we can mechanically do these things and and men can, you know, straighten their lives up and so on and so forth. And a lot of people do it outside of the message and a lot of people do it within the message. But then we have to say, you know, what is it and why are we actually doing that? Is it something that we learned or we grew up with all of you young people? You said, well, this is what my parents imposed on me. This is what was required. This is the way we live because we're believers. But it may not become a revelation to you yet. &gt;&gt; It may not be a reality to you. But once it's a reality to you, the struggle's all over &gt;&gt; because it has become a part of your life. It's a part of your fiber. It's a part of everything. It's like trying to argue uh you know that uh I I get I I I go off the road and get stuck in the ditch and finally get out and somebody said, "Nah, you weren't stuck in the ditch." Hey, don't don't don't don't give me any problem. I'm the one that experienced it. I was stuck. I couldn't get out by myself and someone helped me out. &gt;&gt; You understand? So you have an experience. Nobody a person's argument is no competition &gt;&gt; for another person's experience. &gt;&gt; And once you have the experience &gt;&gt; and revelation is an experience that goes beyond works, &gt;&gt; goes beyond knowledge, goes beyond all the learning, &gt;&gt; it it goes far beyond that. So Jesus called his disciples. He called them his own. He called them his elected. He called them those that the father had given him. And yet yet even after two three years and he knew that they were elected. He knew that they were given. He knew that the father had given them. Yet he needed to pose this question. Who who do you say I am? Who who is this? even after he'd called them come follow me I'll make you fishers of men now those people could have said you called us I didn't call you to follow you that's what I'm doing but he wants to know who do you say who do you say this is I'm just posing that question in uh like now here here we come to kind of a a mysterious part in the unveiling of God brother says now my subject this morning. I trust that God will reveal this and each time if you who take the tapes listen and I hope and trust that you have a spiritual understanding of what uh that God has been trying to get out to the church without saying it uh without without saying it right out. In other words, without just making a straight flat statement, it it it remains a wee bit veiled. And this is in the message, the unveiling of God. So even in the unveiling of God, there can be that part. He said, I trust that you'll have spiritual understanding. I'm praying that I'm praying for myself. I've been much in prayer. God, I want to have a spiritual understanding, a spiritual grasp, not enough just to read a message. Not enough just to hear a message. Not enough to just come to church here. Not enough to sing the songs and worship. That's not enough. &gt;&gt; We need the spirit of God &gt;&gt; on an individual basis &gt;&gt; to reveal to us what it is we're actually participating in. &gt;&gt; This is not because it's my friends or my family or my parents or or or even because I have an office in the church or even because I'm I'm the pastor of the church. That's not sufficient. I say, "Well, I'm the pastor." They could have said, "Well, we're disciples. We're mighty apostles. We've been called by the master himself." It wasn't enough. &gt;&gt; Who do you say that I am? Have you actually been able to identify and recognize who this is &gt;&gt; and where we're at at this at this particular time? And he said, he went on to say, "It's a thing sometimes we have to say things in such a way that it might thin down." Amen. &gt;&gt; It might bring some to go out, some to leave, some to ponder over. Look, when uh the L the angel of God came to Mary and began to tell her what part she would play in the in the birth of Jesus Christ, how can these things be, seeing, I've not known a man? And he said, 'The spirit of the Almighty will be overshadow thee and and you shall conceive a son and and and begin to describe some of the event. And the Bible says that she held those things and pondered them. Why did she ponder them? Because she didn't fully understand it. &gt;&gt; But she believed &gt;&gt; and said, "Let it be according to your word." And that kind of faith took her across the chasm from where her understanding ended &gt;&gt; and faith took her across &gt;&gt; and span that place &gt;&gt; of that mysterious part that mysterious aspect. &gt;&gt; He says then it might be that some would say you mean that God would purposfully do a thing like that. Listen now. He said he certainly did &gt;&gt; and he does yet. &gt;&gt; I say we're here anticipating a resurrection. We're here anticipating a rapture. We're here anticipating a change of our body. &gt;&gt; We are a people who have received number one the sign of the Messiah. &gt;&gt; Yes sir. Number two, we have received the sign of the resurrection. &gt;&gt; Number three, he has said we have received the last great sign. &gt;&gt; And we know that we have received a vindicated forerunner who has both come and gone. &gt;&gt; Where are we? &gt;&gt; And could you tell me how is it going to happen? How was it actually going to take place? Can you define for me how that resurrection, how are we going to recognize it and identify it when we have a record here in the scripture that even after he was resurrected and seen of many many uh bodies of many were seen in the streets of Jerusalem. There's no record in history that the outside of the scripture that the people history never recognized it. Caiaphas never saw it. Herod never saw it. The Roman Empire never saw it. It was to some believers, but it did happen. Can you Can you understand? A prophet of God said that that God in that resurrection emptied out emptied out paradise. You know, all the prophets, all of those, the patriarchs, all of those that had believed, he emptied out paradise, and many bodies of the saints were seen in the streets of Jerusalem, and no one outside of the believers knew anything about it. How is this resurrection going to be taking place? We can we can, you know, speak about it. I hope not too glibly or glibly at all and not too lightly at all. But there's going to be those and and the only record we have is when Jesus was resurrected himself, Mary couldn't recognize him. The two on the way to Emmas couldn't recognize him. So, we have a fundamental truth in the scripture that it's going to take a divine revelation from God and God is going to have to stay with you and walk with you until you identify and know what is actually happening. [Music] &gt;&gt; That's the mysterious part of it and how we're going to be changed. So, this is kind of where I'm going. And the greater than Solomon is here. He said, now I have a lot of quotes, but they are in I have labored over this because I'm trying to identify uh some big questions in my own heart. So I'm not just giving you a bunch of answers today. I'm actually just giving you some quotes that I am pondering. So I share my my pondering thoughts with you. But in sincerity he said men do receive God number one and believe him number two and then they pull themselves off. They believe God. They receive him and they pull themselves off. And he says we got this that there that that's all there is to it. Some say well well that's all there is to it. And then they separate themselves. We've seen it even within the message. And then they won't take no new revelation. They organize it. This is it. This is our doctrine. This is the end. And they said they end with a period. He says if you if you'd have a denomination and you would end your denomination or end your doctrine with a comma. He said we believe this plus as much as God will show us then that's all right. So I want to say today that uh you know say if say well I'm a message believer Malachi 4 praise God Luke 17:30 and the messenger to you better put a comma at the end of it &gt;&gt; because the revelation is a moving living thing &gt;&gt; and it's not for us to imagine what it is. God's going to make it very very clear. We don't have to go on and presume or go on presumption. &gt;&gt; We don't have to assume anything. God's going to make it very very clear. But we want to be So you might ask, and I have this for later on in the service, well, what should be my posture? How should I conduct myself? I would say this. You cannot absorb yourself too much with what God has given us in the message. I don't believe that you can OD &gt;&gt; on the word of God. &gt;&gt; I believe you need to absorb it, hold it, ponder it, even say, "I don't understand it." Stay with it, ponder it, read it again, pray about it, be sincere. [Music] &gt;&gt; I believe that is essential for this rapture. Amen. &gt;&gt; Don't put a period, &gt;&gt; put a comma. It's a continuous unveiling of God &gt;&gt; in the message. Notice the message now. Who do you say this is? &gt;&gt; He said, "Time hasn't changed. People are designed the same as they were then." He's the same yesterday, today, and forever. He said the question isn't to them anymore. The question is not to them back there anymore. They asked they asked who it is. But in 1964, and I put in 209, the question is, who do you say it is? What's this all about? Have you stopped to search the scriptures? And who do you think this is? The and today the scripture promised for this hour friends is fulfilled right in our midst hour after hour. And who do you think it is? Amen. &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham was posing this and friends after showing and demonstrating God in front of the people and now we have such a uh complete and comprehensive uh message. You have hundreds and hundreds of times when the secret of people's hearts was revealed. And he went back to that and that's what he was saying to them. Who do you think this is? Who's doing that? They had it well as it's a gift. It's a gift of knowledge or it's a gift of one of the gifts of the Holy Spirit. And that caused them to bypass it. And then there were others that said, "Well, you know, we go down to the restaurant, we eat with him, and so on and so forth." And he became too common, and that caused him to bypass it. Yeah. &gt;&gt; And so we come here and we say, "Well, this is what we believe and this is who we fellowship with. These are the songs we sing and these are the, you know, these are the officers of the church and here's and these are the ministers and these are our ministers." It can just get just too common and cause a person to really miss the very essence. And you and you might say, "Well, you know, maybe that's not so serious." It's real serious when the resurrection rapture taking place. Amen. &gt;&gt; You don't want to be in that state when that's happening. And furthermore, let me shock you. It may be happening in a different fashion than you expected it to happen. And things could be happening around us because I'm also going to take you to one of the profound truths that's in the message and all through the word of God that the thing that was foretold was so clearly stated and it should have it should have registered and did register in the human mind. But the people were uh trusting that they understood it and that and and and the chasm between understanding it and having the mechanics of it and the dynamics or the revelation of it. That chasm they they were because what they they didn't they didn't understand what they what the actual meaning of it was. And so they kind of put that out and you know put a period behind I guess what they believed and uh uh never came to the full understanding the full revelation didn't participate in it. &gt;&gt; And and and brother Brandham says it passed by. &gt;&gt; He says another place it passed right through them. And one was John the Baptist who prophesied. Couldn't have been any clearer. prophesied his father was a priest and and he prophesied even his father turned dumb and couldn't speak &gt;&gt; as a result of not believing the message. So the people who came to the synagogue or wherever he he ministered before the Lord, they they knew John's father Zachcharias. They they knew him. He spoke fluently. Suddenly he can't speak. An angel came told me I'm my my my wife aged wife Elizabeth's going to have a son and she gets pregnant and has a son. All of this is taking place and the son lives and grows up. In the meantime, the Messiah comes and he's there for 30 years. Who knows about it? That's the mysterious part. &gt;&gt; It's been prophesied by Isaiah, prophesied by prophesied by uh the Psalms, prophesied by Moses, prophesied all through the And here he is the fulfillment of it all. And it's passing right by them. It's &gt;&gt; passing right through them. And they're not catching it. &gt;&gt; Not it, not a day, not just something that just happened overnight. this passed by, you know, one month and the next month and six months and a year and it was all passing by. The fulfillment, the revelation, the fulfillment was going by, but and they had a knowledge. Oh, we know him. His mother, his his brethren are here and his, you know, we we know him. We know where he we know where he was born. We know where he slept. So, why is why is brother Brandham saying that? because he's talking to a group of people that I that identify that much about him, but he's telling them you're missing it. &gt;&gt; And I don't want us to just become, you know, uh claiming to be believers and uh and the dangerous part is we put a period behind that when we ought to be having a comma behind it. And and and what what what are you saying, brother Ed, by saying we ought to have a calm? I'm saying you should be moving on. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; In the revelation of the word, &gt;&gt; you should be progressing in your spiritual walk with God. You should see that. And if you don't see that, then you got to you got to get down, get real serious with God. &gt;&gt; Amen. So only the revelation of Matthew 16 can span the chasm from human knowledge to the revelation. Now brother Bram says about faith. Faith is the only direct and positive sense and it's the sixth sense. Faith is more than sight. &gt;&gt; Faith is more than feeling. &gt;&gt; You do not feel faith. You don't taste faith. You don't smell faith. You don't see faith. Faith is the substance of things &gt;&gt; hoped for &gt;&gt; and the evidence of things not seen. &gt;&gt; You believe that? &gt;&gt; So the everpresent God. Now I touched on this while I was away and it really quickened some of the things I want to bring to you this morning and that is that you know we we are uh in our human uh our human understanding. We I know that we think of God as being you know in the heavens our father which art in heaven and uh but really where is he and then a prophet comes and says that God is everywhere he we we say he's omnipresent he's omnisient he's everywhere so God is right beside me uh the the the very attributes the influence the angels of God are present Amen. &gt;&gt; And uh and and I'm going to come to that because there are things while God changes. You pray for yourself and pray for me. &gt;&gt; While God changes and the reason he changes and in the message the unveiling of God, brother Brandham uses a whole series of statements, phrases. He will use changing his form, changing his mask. He will use right in connection with that coming down. What's he doing? He's coming down where hopefully you can reach through by faith and find out and discover he's not somewhere distant place but he happens to be right here. &gt;&gt; And when you finally come to that uh not just understanding revelation of it, he's right present. Then you begin to find out that his attributes are also present. &gt;&gt; Healing is not something you have to pull down. It's right present. &gt;&gt; His mercy is right present. &gt;&gt; All of his attributes are right present. &gt;&gt; And when you have a group of people that begin to understand and believe that and enter into the revelation of the present God, how do I know he's present? He's revealed himself to me. &gt;&gt; I see him beyond the senses of the body. I've entered into the sixth sense &gt;&gt; and my faith has touched him. &gt;&gt; My faith has laid hold of him &gt;&gt; and it has his his his word has become substance to me. You can never take it away. &gt;&gt; And that is called his descending. So faith is is uh brings the God into the present. &gt;&gt; Now on the day of Pentecost, now Peter after he said, "Thou art the Christ, the son of the living God." Then Jesus responded to him and said, "Blessed art thou Peter, flesh and blood has not revealed this to you, but my father which is in heaven. And I say unto thee, thou art uh thou art Peter, and I will uh uh upon this church, upon this revelation, uh I will build my church. Flesh and blood has not revealed it to you. And then Peter when he was done, he stood up on the day of Pentecost and he reaches into the Old Testament to the book of Joel. And this is what's important. Now, just follow these principles. And he brings the book of Joel second chapter right forward to the present moment. And when he's done he tells them this Jesus &gt;&gt; this Jesus not way back there but Joel's prophecy now this happened and he told them this Jesus whom you knew this Jesus who you crucified he has resurrected and we're witnesses of the resurrection. And he said and this Jesus hath God raised up whereof we are all witnesses. And they were pricricked in their hearts said, "Men and brethren, what must we do?" Because bringing the historical Christ and bringing him alive in front of the people in a current event that had just taken place, bringing it forward and and and because it became absolutely they became confronted with an event. They knew about the event. They knew that Jesus had been crucified. They knew all of that, but they didn't realize it tied to the scripture. And when they found that the scripture had been fulfilled and it was actually on the verge of passing through them &gt;&gt; leaving them in the in the past leaving it as a fulfilled thing then they became pricricked in their heart what must we do and he said to believe and be baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ. So I want to conclude this part by saying that God worked through Peter to uncover or reveal Jesus of Nazareth whom they knew. That was their understanding. But he had to bridge that chasm and bring them to a revelation and let them know this Jesus whom you knew. This Jesus of Nazareth who you knew dwelt in Nazareth and walked the shores of Galilee and did all these various things. He is both and by the scripture he is both the Lord and Christ. &gt;&gt; Here it is right now at this moment. &gt;&gt; I want you to hold that. Just hold that as I'm I'm going to take some time with it. You know, we we see and hear of things and probably read in newspaper and hear it on the news or whatever more. I just wondered if it might mean something uh here the last few days uh Pope Pope Benedict uh he's he's in a Muslim nation and he's telling them that I have such deep respect for the Muslims and uh he's called he called on for reconciliation between Christians and Jews. A day after stressing, this is the day after stressing his deep respect for Islam. On his first trip to the Holy Land as pontiff and on the second day of his visit in to the Middle East, Pope Benedict stressed the need for harmony and unity between Christians and Muslims. The prophet of God has said that that system is a beast system. &gt;&gt; And he said that America is found in the 13th chapter, Revelation &gt;&gt; and our new president of America. And the the scripture says that there was a another beast that raised up out of the land and it was like a lamb &gt;&gt; but it spake &gt;&gt; as the dragon. &gt;&gt; And now we have the beast system. I'll say system. I don't identify the man but I'll say it is a beast system. &gt;&gt; Cruel, rich, &gt;&gt; pompous. an incredible system. And here we have it. The head of it is in a Muslim nation reconciling with the Muslim people. And the most powerful and richest nation on earth, their leader is going to make a major speech, his first major speech outside of America. and he chooses Egypt because he wants to appeal to the Muslim people. And it is said of President Obama will travel to Egypt next month. This is scarcely 30 days apart to deliver his promised address to the Muslim world culminating at a long and politically sensitive selection process by choosing as his venue an Arab nation. Hey, I have nothing against the Arab people at all. I'm just saying this is seems to me to be more than a coincidence &gt;&gt; that the scripture says that the lamb beast will say the same thing that the dragon will say. &gt;&gt; And here we are scarcely 30 days apart. And you have the beast system of revelation making overtures and making statements about the Muslim world. And friends, their God is not the God of the Bible. &gt;&gt; Are you listening? &gt;&gt; So is perhaps I'm not saying it is, but perhaps it is something say, "Well, I didn't even know that." Well, that's just what like a whole lot of other things going to happen &gt;&gt; and it'll slip and pass right by. and you say, "Oh, well, I thought &gt;&gt; I thought Elijah was supposed to come." Do you know? I want you to try to appreciate where you're sitting today. Do you know that there are churches filled with thousands and tens of thousands of people are waiting for Malachi 4? Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; And Malachi 4 has passed by &gt;&gt; in 30 years of ministry, and a handful of people know about it. you know about it. &gt;&gt; It's already happened. &gt;&gt; And so on one side of the street, they are waiting and looking for this forerunner and he's supposed to come to forrun the Messiah. And here's another group of people maybe just across the street and saying, "Thank God, &gt;&gt; he's already come. Thank God we've already heard it. Thank God we've received the voice, vindicated voice. Thank God. What a change it's made. &gt;&gt; Oh, what a change it's made. &gt;&gt; Has it not? &gt;&gt; Did he do it? &gt;&gt; Not our goodness that brought it on. &gt;&gt; Nothing that we did. &gt;&gt; Even nothing that you did that God selected and said, "I'll show it to you." &gt;&gt; And your mind was boggled. Said that, "Can that be?" And he stayed with you. &gt;&gt; And he stayed with you. and your maybe your friends and your parents said you've gone off the deep end. &gt;&gt; That isn't what it means. Look at what this theologian said. Look at what this doctor said. Look what this uh these high educated people. Look what they said. Said, "But my heart is saying that I've what I've heard is the truth." Who did that? Not you. You didn't learn it. Didn't happen Sunday school. Didn't happen. Didn't even come over this pullpit. But something by the sovereign act of God &gt;&gt; caused you to believe it &gt;&gt; even when your own mind was saying there's something a miss here I it doesn't reconcile. Uh there's things that I can't reconcile in the message but your heart kept saying it's the truth. It's the truth. It's the truth. and you hung on to that and then on down the road, woo, there it is. &gt;&gt; And you look back &gt;&gt; and you see things that have happened that you know only God can do. &gt;&gt; He said, uh, I'm just putting this in in the Philadelphiaian church age. He said, "Furthermore, the elect will not only be kept, but as this move becomes the image erected to the beast, the saints will be gone in the rapture." &gt;&gt; There's going to be events happening just like are happening right now. &gt;&gt; And the saints are going to be gone in a rapture. And this little delightful winsome movement that started out in fellowship at Ephesus in the first church age will become the monster of Satan that defiles and deceives the whole world. That's what the scripture says. for the church system of the Roman Catholic and the Protestant in coming together for this great ecumenical movement will control the whole wealth of the world system and force the whole earth into its religious trap or will kill them by refusing them the privilege of buying and selling whereby they would make a living. This will be accomplished simply for the harlot's daughters &gt;&gt; are all but gone back to her &gt;&gt; already &gt;&gt; all but gone back to her. In the meantime, Rome has acquired nearly all. &gt;&gt; I'm being very specific now. Rome has acquired nearly all the supplies of gold. The Jews have the bonds and all the paper. &gt;&gt; At the right time, the harlot will destroy the present day money system. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; By calling in all the paper and demanding gold. With no gold, the system falls. I listened to a professor who was speaking on behalf of the nation of Sweden and the investigative reporter was asking because they're all consumed with and even to this day very much consumed with the economic system and you hear it all over the place. The old system will not function anymore. They must have a new economic system. And it will be a one one world monetary system. It doesn't mean that your money will be the same as everyone else's money but or that everyone will have euros as many of the nations just uh uh use euros today and they gave up their local currency and others are more resistant to it. The British want their pound and and the and the Norwegians want their croner and and the same thing with the Swedish people. But this man was speaking on behalf of the government and the reporter said just in lay in layman's terms tell me what the economy is. What is the economy? He said that's very difficult to answer that but he said it is not a it's not an economy of currency. It's not a economy of money. It's not that. He said it's an economy of of of confidence. &gt;&gt; Doesn't matter how many billions of dollars in paper you have or whatever more. If the people lose their confidence, they aren't investing and they aren't spending. They aren't it isn't moving. The whole economy grinds to a halt. people who you work for, they say, "Well, we're not going to be doing that just now or we're cutting back." And people lose their jobs and everybody and they say, "Well, then I'm not going to buy a home. I'm not going to buy a car. I'm not going to invest." And the whole economy starts to crumble because the confidence is gone. And he was saying it's it's an economy of confidence, not an economy. Now, I want to say this to you. This can pass by. Rome can have all the gold or have control of it. Not that they got it all stored in tons and tons in the Vatican. They control it. &gt;&gt; And the Jews have the paper. What's the paper worth? Nothing. It's an economy of confidence. And then Israel begins to find out that they're being squeezed out of their favored position &gt;&gt; with America. &gt;&gt; And it's already well into the wind that America is not going to provide them with the arms, the greatest friend that America has in that country of all dictators. &gt;&gt; But they're going to woo. &gt;&gt; That's it. &gt;&gt; And that's exactly what the scriptures say. And I want to say this congregation, how do you know that some of this isn't already passing right through us at this moment while we're sitting here? &gt;&gt; And the people, hey, the Jews, the Jews, don't forget the Jews in Israel. Israel is full of millions of people and they're still looking for they're still looking for Jesus Christ who hasn't who's come and gone 2,000 years ago. Amen. &gt;&gt; Listen, this is how it passes by. The Bible says, and I've looked up this, I haven't got time, but the Bible says God will say, "I will send a famine." &gt;&gt; Exactly. &gt;&gt; He says, "Other place, I will scatter you &gt;&gt; to all the nations." That's right. &gt;&gt; He says another place uh I'll raise up this Nebuchadnezzar in Babylon and you will go into bondage. &gt;&gt; And I Jeremiah got up and prophesied you'll be there for 70 years. &gt;&gt; And there were others that raised up and says we'll only be there for two. And so they had uh dispute about that. But God said you'll be there and you'll be under bondage for 70 years. Do you know what they did? It passed right by. They went into bondage and a lot of the Jews prospered. &gt;&gt; They went into famine. They said, "Well, do you know what? We're in tough economic times." They never got any revelation from it. &gt;&gt; They were right in the midst of God's judgment, &gt;&gt; but never got any revelation. It didn't turn the people to God. It didn't say, "Oh, God sent this. We want to return to God." No. What I'm saying to you is that judgment can pass by and people aren't awakened by it. &gt;&gt; God's forerunner of Christ not only can pass by, but does pass by. &gt;&gt; The spirit of Elijah passed by in John the Baptist didn't waken them up. &gt;&gt; They were attracted to it. Came by the thousands, filled up the wilderness, but passed by. And the fulfillment of the scripture passed by. &gt;&gt; The resurrection passed by. &gt;&gt; The ascension of Jesus passed by. &gt;&gt; And it says, why gay up into heaven? This same Jesus who came shall come back in like manner. &gt;&gt; So it says, well, we're looking for the clouds and we're looking for this. Hey, he he ascended and the whole thing passed by. The ascension passed by without them even knowing &gt;&gt; what's wrong with the descension. &gt;&gt; Passing by. &gt;&gt; And quite frankly, I believe he has descended. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Amen. I cannot I cannot take this entire ministry 33 years of ministry unlike anything since Adam. &gt;&gt; I'm not preaching at you. I'm making a statement. You can read whatever book you want to read. I'd be happy for any person here or on the internet to bring me any book where there's any record of any ministry that even remotely resembles &gt;&gt; what God sent at this time. where do you have a man standing? And people lined up and even turns from them, starts pointing down into the audience. Friends of mine from Alaska who adopted uh an Eskimo boy and now they were down in New Mexico. And the little boy began to run at his nose and his sinuses ran till he had this just massive cold sores all over his lips and they couldn't figure out what to do with him. who wasn't able to get any medical treatment for him. And that prophet of God stands right there. Those people lived in my town. My wife and I know them well. We know the little boy and they moved down to New Mexico and went over to a meeting of brother Brandon. They're sitting in the audience. They don't know him at all. And he points down says to this couple, "You have a a son, a little boy." And he he described the trouble and the sores that he has. And he says, "Uh, I see mountains and I see tall trees." He said, "It's Alaska. The little boy's from Alaska." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And he's not accustomed to this heat that's down here. And that set up an allergy in him. He's allergic to it. and has caused them to be this way. That's thus sayeth the Lord. &gt;&gt; Where did you have that? &gt;&gt; I'm I'm confronting the congregation today. Where did we have that? That and he even said clearly. I have many quotes and I think that you know it. He said that's not a man, that's Christ. &gt;&gt; It's not a man, that's Christ saying that. And here's where you have to get the line of demarcation. when a when a prophet of God was saying thus sayith the Lord &gt;&gt; even brother Brandham says that was God to the people &gt;&gt; because without that the people didn't have any concept of God raised up the man and spoke the word of God to the people so they could recognize God is amongst us &gt;&gt; God is in Israel &gt;&gt; God is in his tabernacle how could they say that was because God was speaking through the man. &gt;&gt; And then as soon he said, as soon as that was over, it was just Moses again. &gt;&gt; And as the prophet would stand, he says, "I'm helpless. I'm your brother. &gt;&gt; I'm just your brother. &gt;&gt; Unless he comes, I'm helpless. Can't do anything. But I want you to identify. I want you to ponder this." When that voice came, when that thus sayeth the Lord, and you don't have to decipher where it is and where it isn't in the message. I tell you, take every word &gt;&gt; that God sent &gt;&gt; and it'll make you feel sometimes as I have been feeling quite mysterious because it you just can't reach out and take a hold of God or the revelation of God like I can reach brother Ernie's hand and shake it. It doesn't happen that way &gt;&gt; because it can pass right by &gt;&gt; and we don't even know. We say, "Oh, economic system. How do we know it isn't this right here?" &gt;&gt; You say, "Well, are you saying it is?" No, I'm not saying it is. How do you know that it's not? Amen. &gt;&gt; How do you know that the two leaders are going the greatest of of all religious order and the greatest of all the nations, the super the single superpower of the earth, both going within 30 days of each other. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; As far as I'm concerned, this lamb beast that is raised up with two horns, political and ecclesiastical, that that beast is saying the same thing. And he says, "And when he spake, he spake as the dragon &gt;&gt; and the dragon speaks first &gt;&gt; and then the lamb speaks again." &gt;&gt; And they say the same thing. We must make peace with these people. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And my message to you is, are you really ready for the rapture? &gt;&gt; Is it possible that it could? And brother Brandham says he's he's talking to he's talking to believers. He says, "And some will say, "Wasn't there to be a rapture?" And he says clearly, "It will have already &gt;&gt; gone by." &gt;&gt; You may be saying, "Oh, Brother Ed, are you ever bringing this down home? Is this ever serious?" That's exactly what I intend to do. &gt;&gt; I think it's I think it's very serious business. Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And the Queen of Sheba, he said, "The thing that we're seeing now, as I want to back this up, I'm taking time on this. I'm not preaching just a normal service." Said, "The thing, what was told you was the truth." He said, "Is that right, sir?" Then he said, "Who did that?" The Messiah, &gt;&gt; Christ. &gt;&gt; He was only using a son of man &gt;&gt; to reveal the son of man. &gt;&gt; And the son of man was Messiah. &gt;&gt; How many of those people How many of those people do you think actually caught the revelation? No. They had the physical man except we hear his words. He doesn't speak very good English. How many of those people do you think and maybe those thousands of people over there actually said that's the Messiah. Why do I say that? Because that's the only one who did it in in John's gospel. He revealed the secret of the heart of the woman at the well. He's the one who told Nathaniel before that Philip called you, I saw you under the tree, said thou art the Christ. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; How many those people catch that? I decided that I would just unload it today. &gt;&gt; Put yourself back in that meeting. &gt;&gt; Exactly. &gt;&gt; And what would you have identified? You'd probably been like the rest of the people. I would have too. I'd just been so taken up. Oh, isn't it wonderful? Praise God. I'm so excited. Do it again. Do it again. Oh, I wish I was up there. I wish they'd call my card. I wish he'd call me. I have all kinds of questions. I've got a Oh, I've got deep troubling things. I wish he would. I wish he'd call me. &gt;&gt; No. How many might have said that's the Messiah, not the man. Only the Messiah can say that something's happening here. Something is passing through this building. Something's passing through this audience of people that they're not catching. &gt;&gt; You know, I know of one case, Sister V. Coral, your uncle, brother Baker, I believe in about 1947, very early. He's sitting amongst hundreds of people in Edmonton, Alberta, and he saw the manifestation of God through the prophet Messenger, and he just said, "That is God's prophet." &gt;&gt; Amen. and he separated himself from everything else and lived the rest of his days as a believer. &gt;&gt; It's the only one I know. I'm moved because there'll only be few. There will only be few. There won't be many. Brother Bram says 500 people can disappear off the earth today. just here. We've got several policemen here in the building right this minute and I can tell you that they've got files of of missing pe persons and they haven't even got time to go and search for them. &gt;&gt; Young people are missing, fathers are missing, mothers are missing. All kinds of people are missing. And the prophet of God likens that and says they'll just be gone. You say, "Well, I would know if somebody's gone." Yeah. You get on the phone. Who do you want to call? Oh, somebody's gone. Your wife's gone. Your husband's gone. A believer that you know is gone. So, you get on the phone. I'll call 911. Say, "I've got a missing. I want to report a missing person." They said, "Well, just a moment. Just a moment. You know when were they missing? What is your name? What is your address? What is your phone? Have you ever done it? I've called 911. Try to call the police. God bless our police. Try to call them. Is this an emergency? If it's emergency, please call this number. If it's not emergency, just hold the line. &gt;&gt; And they come on. Say, I want to report someone's missing. My wife's missing. My husband's missing. say just be calm. Take your address and everything. Take your name. That's exactly what would happen. &gt;&gt; And you think, so you think the whole world's going to respond. No. No. They'll say, "Well, we'll we'll call you back or we'll try and get in touch with you. We'll Hey, it happens all the time. &gt;&gt; Maybe it's not going to be just like we thought. Just whole church empty of people. says, "The angel came down and said, as John was sent to wind up the Old Testament and bring forth the introduction of Christ, your message will wind up the loose ends and will introduce the Messiah just before his coming." &gt;&gt; That has happened. Amen. &gt;&gt; The Messiah has been introduced. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; That has already happened. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Just before the coming. That's what the angel of God said. And look away to Jesus. He said, "I may not do it, but this message will introduce Jesus Christ to the world." &gt;&gt; You may wonder why we go and why we send people, why we are desirous. We don't have a kingdom. We don't have a denomination to build. We have one thing to make this Christ who is the word the fulfilled word in this season to make that known to the people. &gt;&gt; Don't be an expectation to this to happen. It has happened. &gt;&gt; This message will introduce Christ to the world. For as John the Baptist was sent to forerrun the first coming, so is this message to forrun the second coming. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And John said, "Behold the lamb of God that takes away the sin of the world." So it paralleled it in every way and I know it will be and the message will go on. &gt;&gt; Do you know how fervently they've tried to stamp this message out? Do you know how they have spoken every kind of people I have people that contact me uh not infrequently contact me and said I was searching on the website I was searching the Google I was searching for prophets I was searching for angels or whatever more and then I came upon uh William Brandham's name and I began to search he says there's a lot of nasty things that said I tell you what any book that you want to find they'll call Call it a cult, &gt;&gt; call it whatever. &gt;&gt; And they cannot lay their finger on one single negative thing of his lifeactly, &gt;&gt; of his actions or of his ministry. &gt;&gt; They say that it's not according to the word of God. But when you take the word and speak to them as I have and say and I have I've sat with even leaders of it, I have said now the absolute will be exactly what this word says. Amen. &gt;&gt; And if you if you come to a a if you come to a a log jam on water baptism, for example, and I show you that every person in this Bible from one cover to the other that was baptized in water was baptized in the name of the Lord or the Lord Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; Will you be baptized that way? Well, my church will not ask you about your church. my Bible school. Not asking you about your Bible school. &gt;&gt; Not ask you about anything. Asking you, have you been baptized? You know, my wife is sitting here. This is Mother's Day. I'm glad for a wife and a mother. &gt;&gt; I wanted to be rebaptized. And I waited 3 4 months. We didn't have a didn't have a church that would baptize us. And she said, "Well, I was baptized and I feel very satisfied with my baptism." She was baptized about 12 years old. I said, "Okay." We didn't It wasn't It wasn't a big thing that we discussed at all. And one day she just said to me, she said, "I I would like to be rebaptized." And what she did was she took every she decided, "I will take every instance of every person that was baptized in the New Testament in the book of Acts." And every single one was baptized in the name of Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So they they'll cast maybe a bad name, oh you're Jesus, holy you're I don't care what you want to say. Call me a hypocrite or call me Bill's above or whatever, but I'm going to do what this book says. &gt;&gt; They say, "Oh, baptize in the name of the father." That's not a name. In the name in in the Son, that's not a name. in the in the Holy Spirit. That's not a name. In three titles, go down to the bank and try and cash a check in your title. Say, "I'm a husband." Say, "Well, I have to have more than that." Well, I'm a father. I'm sorry. Well, I'm a grandfather. No, that's not I'm a greatgrandfather. Surely you can give me some money. I need it bad. No, it says, "What's your name?" &gt;&gt; What's your name? &gt;&gt; You're going to transact any business, we want to know what your name is. Yeah. &gt;&gt; Like old old brother Evans in India. Hey, Warhorse stood in the water while the people were being baptized and he told them clearly, "It wasn't the father that died for you. You're going to go to the water to be buried. The father wasn't buried. &gt;&gt; The Holy Ghost didn't die on the cross. The Holy Ghost wasn't buried in a sephilar. God didn't go to a sephilar. Jesus Christ went to the selicer. Jesus Christ was buried and you're going to be buried with him. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And how many people can you convince? And because they have another theory or another doctrine, I have to ask where did it come from? &gt;&gt; Not from here. Amen. &gt;&gt; And Jesus said, "This is the seed." &gt;&gt; And there's no life outside of the seed. &gt;&gt; Hold a seed in your hand. There's no life outside of the of the seed on this side or this side. And I say there's no life anything outside of this word of God. This is God's word. [Music] &gt;&gt; In s we would see Jesus. Now, let me just stay with this a few moments. I'm not going to be much longer. Brother Lance is ministering tonight and I will be taking this up because I have a I have a lot of PowerPoint. I want I want you to read some of these quotes with me and a whole lot that I haven't I won't have time for with this morning. Is this all right? If we take a service like this in service, we would see Jesus. He said, "Remember before this," and brother Brandham was talking about the judgment. Before this happens, before the judgment happens, the church has to go. So, we're at the end time. We're right in the shadows of his coming &gt;&gt; right now. &gt;&gt; 1957. &gt;&gt; I'm so thankful to see that he's come down to prove his word. &gt;&gt; Amen. He's done what? &gt;&gt; He's come down to prove his word. &gt;&gt; If it's before a dozen or before a million, but it'll pass right through the people. The million will never know about it. A million people, half the population of Vancouver. It will pass right through them. &gt;&gt; Amen. And they won't know a thing about it. &gt;&gt; They won't even say, "I just had a funny feeling." No, there'll be no feeling at all. &gt;&gt; And the scripture will have been fulfilled. &gt;&gt; This isn't what you expected to hear this Sunday morning, I'm sure. But this is intended to send you away pondering &gt;&gt; very, very deeply. &gt;&gt; That's good. &gt;&gt; And it'll pass right through. He said, "It's always been that way." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The prophets, pastor, oh my, I could start preaching on it. I I I hope you can bear with me. He said, "It's always been that way and it always will be that way." &gt;&gt; And we're we're not in it always was that way, but we are in the all will be that way. He says, "And then they'll wonder something. Well, I didn't uh really I didn't know it. Uh God's God God eyes but can't see. Brother Brandham says in a message a door in a door. &gt;&gt; He says, you know, one day the Bible had foretold of a great coming prophet that was going to gather Israel together. And when he came, you know, he passed right through the people and they didn't know it. And then one day Jesus was speaking to his disciples, the son of man's going up to Jerusalem and so forth. And they said, why why did the scribes say that Elias must first come? Now his own disciples are asking him, why did the scribes, this other group say that Elias must first come and restore all things? And he said, I say unto you, truly Elias will first come, but I say that Elias is already come and you didn't know it. telling the disciples, "You didn't know it. He went right through." &gt;&gt; They didn't know it. Likewise, the son of man. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hello, friends. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Cloverdale Bible Way. &gt;&gt; Help us, Lord. &gt;&gt; I would be honest with you. You know, some are satisfied just to be associated with believers. So, well, you're good people, nice people. I want to be part of it and my children to the school. I I see the young people. I want I see the young ladies. I want my teenagers to be this way. I want And there may be others who say, "I'm going to go completely the other side." say, "Brother Biscll, it's been a real struggle for me. I don't even know why I'm hanging on, but there's something inside that won't let me go. &gt;&gt; It will not let me go. I'm going to be perfectly honest, perfectly frank. That's why I came here today. &gt;&gt; I didn't want to preach this morning. I've been suffering severe jet lag. I'm going to tell you if the rapture happened right now and I was asking myself are there any in this church going to be left &gt;&gt; and I say yes there will be &gt;&gt; at this time you say are I I I would like to hear something positive. This is the most positive thing you can hear &gt;&gt; is you need to pull up your spiritual bootstraps. &gt;&gt; You need to get real serious with God. Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; It's not a sufficient say, well, we'll come to church on Sunday morning or it doesn't matter if we miss or you know, I can just live I can live partway in the world. I live partway here. Sometimes I see a face come in and maybe don't see them for weeks and weeks, but they come in some shake hands and how are you? I call them sister. I call them brother. But you'd want me to be honest. If they said to me, "Brother Ed, do you think I'm going to make it?" I'd say, "No, I don't think you are not living where you are." And I think if you asked yourself that question down in your own heart and soul, I this isn't condemnation now because there is a people who say, "Absolutely. &gt;&gt; Absolutely. I know. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; I've tried to let go lots of times. I can't let go cuz he won't let go of me. &gt;&gt; Hey friends, we're not here to go to church. &gt;&gt; We're here to participate &gt;&gt; in the in the taking away of the church. &gt;&gt; We're not even looking for his coming. &gt;&gt; That's what the forerunners message is all about. &gt;&gt; He says, "You will introduce &gt;&gt; the bride to Jesus Christ." and she goes from here to the to the supper. &gt;&gt; I'm not looking for something to dispense out of the sky. &gt;&gt; Christ has come in that regard &gt;&gt; and it's passing directly. His first coming passed through the Jews and his second coming passed through the Gentiles. [Music] Now, there's been those that have gone off, maybe gone off and assumed certain things and made certain statements, made certain declaration. We don't have to make any declarations. Anything I'm saying, I'm going to back it up by a by a quote. &gt;&gt; I back it up by the word of God. &gt;&gt; Even when the prophet of God says it'll pass right through, I want to see it in the scripture. And I see where the spirit of Elijah passed through in the form of John the Baptist. I see where Jesus Christ passed through. I see where the resurrection passed through. I see where the ra where the catching away and the ascension of Christ. It all passed through. &gt;&gt; And I'm going to say the same characteristic is with us today. &gt;&gt; Don't think that anything has changed. It's the same characteristic. &gt;&gt; And we can say, well, you know, we're we're we're a special elected of the elect of the elect and all the rest of it. Don't put a period behind it &gt;&gt; because this revelation is keeping on moving &gt;&gt; and there's door and a door and Jesus said as it was in the days of Noah. Notice what he's doing. He's going back. Can I just have five more minutes? I'm going to close. As it was at the days of Noah, so shall it be in the coming of the son of man, wherein eight souls were saved by water. What if today the rapture came and he took two from Tucson and one from Phoenix and around the world as a universal rapture will be. And the ones that rise from the dead will go to meet him in the air and steal away a mysterious thing. He asked the question, a mysterious thing. And then one of these days, judgment drops upon the earth. Remember my comment. God judged the earth. He judged nations. He said, "I'm going to send a famine." They didn't. The woman in in Elisha's time was caught in the famine. The nation wasn't recognizing, "Oh, this is what God said." No, they're just saying, you know, we're having tough times. We don't have as much food as we had yet. We don't have as much money as we had. We don't have as much things. We have to really tighten our belt. Things have really tightened up. It wasn't. They didn't recognize God's word and judgment was passing through the land. &gt;&gt; They didn't know it. &gt;&gt; And you know what? And then God allows and on down the road, good times come. &gt;&gt; And now they got lots of rice and lots of oil and lots of meal. And so good times. That's exactly what happened. True. &gt;&gt; It's all through the scriptures. You might be saying and I hope it is. Oh, this is a very very mysterious. Yes, there is a very mysterious aspect because then I have to come and uh and this same prophet said, brother Brandham said very clearly, they'll be preaching after the rapture happened. They'll be preaching. And I just say, "Oh God, I don't want to even preach to you folks today." I say, "My heart, oh God, don't let me be standing here &gt;&gt; thinking that I have a sermon &gt;&gt; after this has happened." He says, "People will be coming to the altar &gt;&gt; and they will be repenting and thinking they're getting saved." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Now, if you want to throw that away, then throw it all away. Exactly. &gt;&gt; If you want to believe it, then let's believe all of it. &gt;&gt; That's the way it's going to happen. &gt;&gt; That is the way it's going to happen, friends. &gt;&gt; Go to Israel. I've been there several times. And I I dare you to try to live the life that they live strict. live by what Jud Gerson Solomon said 600 and some laws of the Old Testament and keep them and have their hair curls or whatever more the hetic Jews and they go through all of the ceremony. Two of them were Gershan and his wife were sitting in in my home and my wife wanted to confirm their airline and she got airlines on the phone on the Shabbat on Sabbath and they said well we need to speak with Mrs. Solomon. So my wife says you know hands the phone says Naomi they need to speak to you. Gerson says Naomi Naomi she said it's just to confirm the flight. Naomi, Shabbat. Shabbat. Okay. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; She went and sat down because electricity is fire and you don't have any fire on the Sabbath on Shabbat. That's how strict they are. Would you live by those laws? And yet the redeemer has already come. &gt;&gt; Amen. and already passed through and walked their land and spoke to them and left a record and left them apostles and left them a testimony and left them several hundred that were witnesses of the resurrection. And where did it go? Nowhere. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; And even that nation, it saddens my heart. some of the most corrupt out of Hollywood, Fox Brothers, Warner Brothers, and the movie star and the industry that has corrupted so much of the world has come from backsliden Jews &gt;&gt; that have backsliden from their faith, from the original faith. And that's why the prophet says, I'm not talking about Wall Street Jews. I'm talking about those. And that's why the scripture says that God reserved 144,000 to himself. But then I looked and I saw another crowd. I saw another group of people, white robed people, thousands upon thousands, the bloodwashed of all the ages. My brother, my sister, the Holy Spirit didn't bring this message to your ears to play with it like a toy. He brought it to your ears because he intends to take you out from mortality to immortality. And I want to know if that's what's in your heart. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; And if this is no more than just a an association of people, then then you should just dispense with yourself and go and do your thing and fill your belly full of all the uh goblygook of the world and all the filth and the perversion. If that's what you want, have it. But you've got a tribulation coming. Thus sayaith the Lord. You've got a time coming that you'll call and he will not answer. &gt;&gt; That's according to the word of God. &gt;&gt; Am I angry? Not a bit. My heart is filled with compassion. I'm holding myself back because I just feel like bursting inside with weeping and tears. For we preach the gospel and people will hear the message, but they don't bend to that word. They don't heed that word. You need to heed it. &gt;&gt; And maybe you've seen it and you've got a certain understanding of it and you see the physical part and oh yes, I know brother Ed, sister Ruth, that's not it. &gt;&gt; I know the deacons and I know this. We go to church and we know it's 10:30 and so on. That had nothing to do with it. This whole place exists for one purpose and that is to see a people go from this world to another one. Because if this if this Bible teaches anything, it teaches that the last enemy to be defeated is death. &gt;&gt; And oh my brother, my sister, I want to see that happen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. I want to see death defeated. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; I've thought more about my mother in the last few years than I have in probably 60. I missed a lot in life. Your boys, Brother Ed was six and a half. I remember like it was yesterday. I was standing right here and a little simple casket was right here. This isn't to make you feel sad or make you feel sorry for me, but I I was sitting right there. There were some big white liies, about three of them, on top of the casket. And a lady, she stepped over. I don't remember exactly who, and she broke one of these liies off and took my hands and put them together and pushed that lily down. And I was holding this big white lily in my hand and looking at that gray box. She was 32, never been sick. And I was holding that lily. Said something's wrong. Something's wrong. Something's terribly wrong. Our life could be so destroyed. I didn't understand death, but I'm holding this close to my heart. And that promise, the last enemy &gt;&gt; to be destroyed is death. &gt;&gt; And oh, you can't feel what I feel. How fervent I am anxious to see that death destroyed. &gt;&gt; And the same book says, "We shall not all sleep, but we shall all be changed." I hold that to my bosom. &gt;&gt; Have your money, have your position, have your job, have all of that, have your education, have it all. But for me, I'll have Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; I'll have him who revealed himself in this hour. &gt;&gt; And if I go by the way of the grave, I have this promise also that we shall rise. &gt;&gt; We shall rise. and that resurrection morning we shall rise. &gt;&gt; So friends, I've been over my five minutes and so I'm going to close with this at this point. And I'm going to take this up probably starting right here where we're at. And you might want to bring a notebook. Next time, I don't know just what day, whether it be Wednesday or Sunday, but I'm going to give you a paragraph. I'm going to give you scripture. I've already commenced preparing for it. And this is really this is not this is not something that I just dreamed up or studied in the last few days. This has been burning on me for a few years. And I have seen this. And if you want if you want to do something for your own benefit, if you have not got the message, the unveiling of God, believe it's volume nine, book one. Brother Brandham says more in this two or three pages than you will hear in the best and the biggest ministry in years. &gt;&gt; They can preach for years. And if you stay and absorb it, you might want to absorb it like I do. You know how long I've been reading? 22 pages? Probably a week. Probably a week. I've been reading 22 pages. And Marco, if you're here, you picked up on that. I'll read a paragraph and I'll go back over it. And when I just read something like this simple, now my subject this morning is to reveal or unveil that God. &gt;&gt; That's enough to stir me right to the bottom of my souls of my feet. The subject this morning is to unveil that God. And I say and I want you to be able to say, "Oh, Father God, reveal yourself to me. You sent this message for that precise purpose." And I can guarantee you this messenger doesn't vary from the word of God. Everything that is in there, you'll find it in the word of God. It is unveiling God of the word. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; I'll have the musicians and I'm going to sing one of my favorite songs, if not my favorite songs. Blessed Assurance. &gt;&gt; Jesus is mine. &gt;&gt; Oh, what a foretaste of glory divine. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; We're born of his spirit and washed in his blood. And there may be those of you. I'm not having an altar service, but there may be some, and I know there are, that need to make an altar right where you're at. Say, "Oh God, I consecrate and I dedicate myself to you in a new and a living way. I dedicate myself. I have been I have not been serious about my soul. You people that are working, you have jobs. How do you think your employer would look upon you if you treated your job or your profession the way you treat this message? Well, you know, if I have time or if it works into my schedule, that won't work, friends. That won't work. And quite frankly, I'm not here to win any medals. I'm here to speak the truth. &gt;&gt; And if this was my last service, I won't apologize over it. And if I get one or two that take me serious today and say, "Brother Ed, that service changed the way I'm looking at things. It has changed. It's changed my agenda." That's what I pray. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Why don't we stand, brother? &gt;&gt; Sing it up with me, please. Jesus is. [Music] Oh, what a [Music] taste of glory. air of salvation. [Music] Lord of his spirit and washing [Music] for this is my story. This is my song. I praise my [Music] for this is my story. This is my song.

[Music] This is my story. This is my song. Praising my Savior all day long. &gt;&gt; Before we sing that last verse, I know that your heart is pricricked and stirred and you might be saying, "Brother Ed, you spoke very, very serious. Brought me to a very serious moment. But tell me what to do. Don't leave me. is hanging here with all these questions. What must I do? I'll tell you exactly what to do. And I feel that the Lord led me this morning to say this to you. You should take the same exact pattern of the two men on the way to Emmas. I cannot get away from this because brother Brandham said this is a prophecy. &gt;&gt; Amen. of thing of modern events made clear by the prophecy. That's the prophecy. And those two men represent all kinds of people &gt;&gt; because number one, they were believers of the message. &gt;&gt; Do you believe it? &gt;&gt; Are you a believer? &gt;&gt; They were following Christ, &gt;&gt; the word. &gt;&gt; Are you? &gt;&gt; Amen. things were happening that they didn't understand. Have you had that happen? &gt;&gt; Yes. And now they're doing more. They're pondering it, Brother Ernie. They're communing with one another. They're not saying, "Oh, hi Peter. How do things go today? How's the job? You got a new job? Oh, what's the schedule like? What what's the salary? Oh, we're having tough times. Oh, what's the economy?" They weren't talking about that. &gt;&gt; They were talking about him. &gt;&gt; What's happening, sir? &gt;&gt; How's things going, brother Ernie, with the believers? How are things down there? How's God dealing with you? How's What do you think about this time that we're in? &gt;&gt; Amen. When my wife went to high school, I see some of you young people in high school. You're going to be graduating shortly. My wife was in high school. She had one of her dearest friends. And they had decided, well, we'll never have a chance to get married. We'll never have a chance to have children because he's coming any moment. We're going to be gone. We're going to be 55 years married in a few days. Don't ask my wife. Ask her, "Are you sorry, Sister Biscll, that you believe that? Are you sorry that you had those feelings back then? Are you sorry as a teenager that you thought you may never get married, you may never have children, you may never experience these things?" I can tell you her answer right now. She says, "Not sorry one bit. &gt;&gt; I'm glad I believed it then. &gt;&gt; And I believe it more today than I believed it back then." There's no regrets &gt;&gt; serving God. Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I hope you folks understand me. I'm not going to ask you to forgive me. I don't think I've said anything I want any forgiveness over. I just want your heart to be pricricked so deep. I want to see such a transformation. &gt;&gt; I even see this whole congregation, this whole church turned Godward. &gt;&gt; What's wrong with living a more holy life, a more separated life? Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And if you're hearing God speaking to you, don't go out of these doors before you sacrificed and consecrated and left everything on the altar and saying, "I am thine, O Lord. I've heard your voice." [Music] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. I'm going to pray the Holy Spirit come down with such a mighty move so gripping in your heart that you won't be able to shake it. Even after you've left here, you won't be able to shake it. &gt;&gt; And here's the first word of this next verse. Perfect. &gt;&gt; Submission. &gt;&gt; All is at rest. I am my savior. I'm happy and blessed. ex. [Music] I am my savior [Music] and happy and blessed. [Music] Watching and waiting. Looking out with his goodness and are lost in his for this is my soul. This is my song. I'm praising my savior [Music] for this is my story. This is my song. I'm praising my savior all the day long. I'm going to sing this song just across on the other side &gt;&gt; and I hope by his grace I expect to be there and I trust that you'll join your voice in &gt;&gt; and that we of this congregation &gt;&gt; will be able to sing. told someone the other day and this was really remarkable. I think I've told it here in the church. Sister Marlene Hilderbrand was on her last moments of life. She was not an old woman. And God laid it on Joanne's heart to fly up there to be at her bedside to deliver a specific message to her. And my wife went with her, asked her mom, "Will you come with me?" She walked up to the bedside. She said, "Sister Marlene, I don't know all her words, but said, "I feel that God sent me here." Brother Brennan's wife, Sister Hope, was passing away. And they called for him quick, but he didn't get there quite in time. And she had just passed. And he called her name, "Hope, Hope." And she stirred and opened her eyes. A young woman in her early 20s with two babies and the one baby dying right beside her of menitis. And her words were, "Why did you call me back? Why did you call me back?" Oh, Bill, it is so beautiful. She couldn't describe it. And Joanne said to Sister Marlene, she said she had so much to live for. She was just a young woman. She could have said, "Oh, Bill, I'm so glad you called me back. My babies need me. You need me. You need me in the ministry. God is using you. You need me." No, that wasn't in her mind. Right? &gt;&gt; Just why did you call me back? Dear friends, I speak as your brother. I speak as your companion who walks with you. I speak to you as one who experienced life. You're 14. I'm 15. or I was 14 when I was praying and the Holy Spirit came on me and I just an old man raised his hand and said, "Make Eddie a preacher." That's the last thing in the world I wanted. But Jesus was 15. Jesus was 17. Jesus was 20. you young people. Jesus knows Jesus was had desires like anybody and he was tempted in all points like we are and yet without sin. This prophet said one more thing and I'm going to leave you with it. We're going to gather around a table. I expect to be at that table. &gt;&gt; It's called a marriage supper &gt;&gt; of the lamb. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And he says that the king will come in. I expect it with everything that's in me. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He'll come in and we'll be having such tears of joy. It's over. Just think, not another temptation. &gt;&gt; Not another trial. &gt;&gt; We're not going to have any of this anymore. and it says, "Don't weep anymore, children. It's all over." &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; That is why I am preaching. That is why we're here. That is why I've come to such a subject as this. Because this must go beyond church. It must go beyond religion. It must go beyond just a profession. It must be something that is a revelation. It must go beyond your understanding into the unknown that you can't even understand and say, "I don't understand it, but I do believe it. [Music] Lift your hand if you wish and we'll pray together. Dear loving and precious Lord Jesus Christ. You're the one that suffered. You're the one that died and rose again. You're the one that spoke things that just baffle us, baffle my mind at times. And today Lord I felt so pressed for the last many days and pondering what it was that that you have actually done and what is happening in this message that is carrying on. And this message has not carried on to establish more groups and just establish some movement of people and a certain class of people. That's not the purpose you're calling. Oh God, you're calling us from this realm. You've called us from another dimension. You've spoken to us so clearly. Lord, make it make it abundantly clear. And I'm praying for those that have been lax. Those that have not been fervent, those that have not been zealous and they are standing here today and they know in their own heart, oh God, that where where they're at isn't sufficient. I pray that you'll move them on up, Lord. loose them in the name of Jesus Christ. And Lord Jesus, I pray that the powers of heaven now will honor my prayer as I come against the enemy Satan who's tried to bind, who's tried to burden down the people. They're encumbered with business. They're encumbered with their learning. They're encumbered with all kinds of things. I pray, Father, they'll rise above it &gt;&gt; in the name of Jesus Christ. May they be loosed to serve you in the full capacity of their calling. I thank you for it. I commit them to you. I commit this word to you in Jesus Christ's name. &gt;&gt; Let it be so. This is my story. Just sing the chorus again, please. &gt;&gt; This is my story. This is my song. [Music] I'm praising my Savior [Music] all day long. For this is my song. This is my song. Praising my Savior all the day long. Hallelujah. Sing the wondrous love of Jesus. Sing his mercy and his praise. in the manion bright and blessed. prepare for us a place when we all [Music] rejoicing that will be when we all see Jesus will sing and shout the victory. Glory. For when we are into heaven, what they are rejoicing will be for Jesus will say and shout. Amen. Amen. I said God bless you. Go get some refreshment. If you feel like staying and being in prayer, that's fine. We won't we'll just dismiss in this way. Ask you to go quietly, reverently, and prayerfully and ponder what you have heard. If you have an opportunity, take out the unveiling of God. There's another one, the mighty God unveiled, but this is the unveiling of God. And if you read that this coming week carefully, prayerfully, and uh ponder what is in there, just there's some very strange things that he said in there, and I want you to be benefited by it. God bless you. You're dismissed in Jesus name. Amen. God bless you. [Music] Heat. Heat. [Music] Heat. Heat. [Music] Hey [Music] there. [Music] behind. [Music] You are [Music] happy. [Music] Heat. Heat. [Music] [Music] Heat. Heat. [Music]
