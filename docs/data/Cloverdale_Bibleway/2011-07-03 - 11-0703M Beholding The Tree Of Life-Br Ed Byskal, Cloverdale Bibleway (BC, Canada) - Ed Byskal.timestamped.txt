[14:41] Jesus, you're all I need.
[14:48] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[14:51] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. That's why we're here this
[14:53] morning, Lord. Because we are believers,
[14:56] Lord.
[14:57] &gt;&gt; We're believers in your supernatural
[14:59] power.
[15:01] We're believers, Lord, in a prophet.
[15:04] Lord, we're not believers in this cosmos
[15:06] of this world, Lord, that's quickly
[15:08] fading away. We're believers in the
[15:11] supernatural, Lord, that you can change
[15:14] hearts, Lord, that are once going
[15:16] astray.
[15:18] You can change lives, Lord. You can
[15:21] change situations
[15:23] at the preaching of your word, Lord.
[15:27] Chains of bondage can be loosed.
[15:31] the captivity can be set captive this
[15:33] morning.
[15:36] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. We believe this morning,
[15:38] Lord.
[15:39] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. As we go to prayer this
[15:41] morning, it's good to have our brother
[15:43] Ernie Villa back. We'll just have you
[15:45] come and
[15:47] pray over the requests. Brother Ernie,
[15:50] we do have a couple of testimonies. How
[15:52] many believe that the Lord is your
[15:53] healer?
[15:55] &gt;&gt; Sister Ella Joy believes that the Lord
[15:57] is her healer. She came up for prayer.
[16:00] It's the other service. The Vanenter
[16:03] family would like to give God praise for
[16:05] touching Ella. Last Sunday, we took her
[16:08] up for prayer as she was in a lot of
[16:10] pain after having a cast removed to
[16:13] stretch her muscles for about 3 weeks.
[16:15] She has had no pain from that time on.
[16:18] &gt;&gt; Amen. We believe this is just one step
[16:21] closer.
[16:23] Hallelujah.
[16:26] Praise the Lord.
[16:28] It's the full restoration
[16:30] &gt;&gt; we're believing for. Amen. Thank you all
[16:33] for your constant prayers.
[16:35] &gt;&gt; Sister Karen Hendrickson believes in the
[16:38] healing power of God.
[16:40] &gt;&gt; God bless you, Sister Karen. She came up
[16:42] for prayer after facing an illness that
[16:44] brought her to the point of death. She
[16:47] is healed.
[16:49] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. I don't think we can
[16:51] overemphasize it, friends. Amen. I don't
[16:54] think we can overemphasize it.
[16:57] We do want to pray for several requests.
[17:01] Um
[17:03] Rebecca Hegman, please pray about her
[17:06] employment situation and that she can
[17:14] Yes. So that she can get free of the
[17:16] situation that she is currently in.
[17:19] Amen. I believe that God will honor that
[17:21] request.
[17:22] There's a brother in Siberia by the name
[17:25] of Boris who uh is a minor and he was in
[17:28] a severe mining accident was nearly
[17:30] crushed to death and the doctors give
[17:32] him about 2% to live. So that's where
[17:35] God steps in. Amen. I believe we can
[17:37] pray this morning with faith believing
[17:39] in our hearts that God will answer
[17:42] prayers of the saints and though he has
[17:44] many that are praying for him in Russia
[17:46] and around the world and we just want to
[17:47] join our hearts with them. want to
[17:49] remember the believers in the
[17:50] Philippines from the recent floods in
[17:53] just the last week or so. And uh brother
[17:56] Ernie, I'll let you read this testimony.
[17:58] God bless you this morning.
[18:02] Boy, it's good to be back into this
[18:05] wonderful supernatural presence.
[18:09] something that uh it's it's so real each
[18:13] time you come back when you've been away
[18:14] for a while and you walk in those doors
[18:16] and you just know that you've entered
[18:19] into a place where where saints have
[18:21] prayed and you can just feel it's like
[18:23] walking into the Holy of Holies. I'd
[18:26] like to thank you each one of you that
[18:28] uh has prayed over the past few months
[18:30] for my uh my stepdad who's passed away
[18:33] and my mom who's now home and she's
[18:35] doing she's doing very very well and uh
[18:39] had an opportunity to speak. We had uh
[18:41] two memorial services, one at the
[18:45] funeral home and the other one at the
[18:47] military service, which was uh was quite
[18:50] dramatic and uh I was just amazed at how
[18:54] many people my stepdad touched along
[18:56] along the way, the years of all of us
[18:59] children growing up and the friends that
[19:01] he made and the friends that he had at
[19:03] work and it was just an awesome
[19:07] privilege to be able to speak to friends
[19:09] and relatives that I had not seen for a
[19:11] long time and not to be in a Catholic
[19:13] setting because he was not a Roman
[19:15] Catholic as most of my other family was.
[19:18] And uh they just gave us total freedom
[19:20] and liberty to be able to speak the word
[19:22] on two occasions and there was some very
[19:24] very dramatic results. And then I had
[19:27] opportunity to go to New York and uh
[19:29] speak at several assemblies there. And
[19:32] uh one thing happened, it was so
[19:34] supernatural. You know, there never had
[19:36] been anybody that I'd ever met who was
[19:38] in Rhode Island that that was in the
[19:40] message. And while I was there, just
[19:42] coming back from the funeral service, I
[19:45] got an email and it was from a brother
[19:46] Matthew. And I hadn't heard from him for
[19:49] so long, but he was an associate pastor
[19:51] of a church down in Boston. And while
[19:54] I'm sitting there in my mother's home
[19:56] just after the memorial service, he
[19:58] sends me an email and says, "Brother
[20:00] Ernie, I just want to inform you that
[20:02] there is now a lighthouse here in Rhode
[20:05] Island. Me and my family and one of the
[20:07] family have moved here and we have
[20:09] established a church and they're going
[20:12] to go on radio and uh they have a a
[20:15] great desire to reach out that little
[20:18] the smallest state in the union with
[20:20] about a million people there." So, and
[20:22] then I called him right back and he
[20:24] says, uh, I told him, I says, "Brother
[20:26] Ernie," he says, "Well, how are you
[20:27] calling me on a 401 area code?" He said,
[20:30] "That's the area code I'm in." So, I
[20:32] told him that I, you know, why I was
[20:34] there and the circumstances that had
[20:36] passed and we met and had some wonderful
[20:38] fellowship. And so, please pray for that
[20:41] uh that small assembly that's uh
[20:43] starting to grow in Rhode Island. And
[20:46] again for the saints in the Philippines,
[20:48] they've gone through some very very
[20:50] tragic events over the past week. Some
[20:52] flooding has just uh inundated several
[20:56] of the the the churches and uh many
[20:59] people were were lost and sent many of
[21:02] them are still missing. But as far as we
[21:04] know, some of the believers were
[21:05] injured, but as far as we know, there's
[21:07] been no casualties. But some churches
[21:09] have been devastated. So please keep
[21:11] those in your prayers. Let's bow our
[21:13] heads.
[21:16] Father, we thank you for
[21:18] this great supernatural symphony that
[21:21] you have sent to us in this day. A
[21:25] symphony, Lord, that that we can have
[21:27] confidence in. We can take it as an
[21:30] absolute because it comes from a
[21:32] supernatural realm. Came from the voice
[21:35] of a vindicated prophet. Lord, we just
[21:38] thank you for that confidence for for
[21:40] thus saith the Lord. when we open that
[21:43] that that message book or listen to the
[21:46] voice, Father, we know that we are
[21:48] hearing from you and and all things are
[21:51] working together for your good. Father,
[21:53] we know that you are going to cause in
[21:56] this last day supernatural conditions to
[22:00] squeeze the bride into the position for
[22:02] a rapture. Father, we're all trusting.
[22:04] We're all waiting. We're all believing
[22:06] on that, Father. And Lord, for those who
[22:09] have put their petitions in for prayer,
[22:12] we thank you for the testimonies. We
[22:14] thank you for the healings that we have
[22:17] heard for Sister Karen and and uh for
[22:19] brother Boris. Lord, just read about how
[22:23] his body was crushed in that mining
[22:25] accident. Lord, just pray that you would
[22:27] raise him up as as a as a testimony to
[22:31] the believers in that area. And Lord,
[22:34] for for uh Sister Rebecca Hegman, Lord,
[22:38] with this need that she has, I pray that
[22:41] you would open the windows of heaven,
[22:42] Father, as she goes out looking for
[22:45] employment, that you would open the
[22:46] right door for her to walk into, that
[22:49] she would be able to organize and
[22:52] position her life in a in a way that
[22:54] would be pleasing to you. And Father, we
[22:57] thank you for for for the the
[23:01] opportunity to be with believers, to be
[23:04] with such a a wonderful loving family of
[23:07] God. Ones that pray for each other, ones
[23:10] that love each other, ones that
[23:12] recognize the filler of fire that is
[23:15] lying inside of each person. Lord, we
[23:18] thank you for all the workers and the
[23:20] laborers in the church, Lord, and in the
[23:23] school building. And Lord, the those
[23:25] that clean the church, those that that
[23:27] that play in the musicians, for our
[23:29] deacons and our trustees, Father, the
[23:32] ministers, Lord, we just thank you for
[23:34] for such a a wonderful a wonderful
[23:38] supernatural existence, a life, Father,
[23:40] that that that is so far above, a love
[23:44] beyond our wildest dreams has come to
[23:46] us. Father, let us fully embrace it.
[23:49] Lord, let us fully manifest that life
[23:52] that you would have us to live. Lord, I
[23:55] pray that the hunger and the thirst for
[23:56] the word of God would grow greater and
[23:59] greater. And Lord, our desire to reach
[24:01] out. We thank you for Brother Matthew,
[24:04] Lord, and for all those that are
[24:05] reaching out to the to the lost that are
[24:08] on the streets of Vancouver and
[24:10] Bellingham and all over Victoria.
[24:13] Father, thank you for Brother Kyle and
[24:15] the labors that he's doing. Lord, we
[24:17] pray for brother Timothy and brother
[24:19] Murphy and the works they're doing
[24:20] overseas. So Lord, we just thank you now
[24:23] and pray that you would come this
[24:25] morning. We've come expecting our hearts
[24:28] are are in great anticipation that you
[24:31] will speak to us the very words that we
[24:34] need to hear. Pray that you bless our
[24:36] pastor, Lord, and as he comes, let him
[24:38] have just a freedom and a liberty, Lord.
[24:40] Let everybody be on the edge of their
[24:42] seat, Lord. Let everybody enter into the
[24:45] service, Lord, with their amens. Father,
[24:47] we just thank you for this great and
[24:49] grand privilege that we have to stand
[24:51] here, knowing there are many thousands
[24:53] around the world that would love to be
[24:55] sitting in the seats that we're sitting.
[24:58] But Lord, you've ordained for us to be
[25:00] here, and we want to take full advantage
[25:02] of that.
[25:03] &gt;&gt; We ask it all in your precious, holy,
[25:06] and wonderful name of our Lord Jesus
[25:08] Christ. Amen. Amen.
[25:11] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[25:12] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. God bless you this
[25:13] morning. You may have your seats.
[25:17] Amen. Amen. Once again, we want to say
[25:19] God bless you and welcome all those that
[25:21] are visiting with us and pray for those
[25:23] that are away. Keep them on our hearts.
[25:26] Some are just starting the vacation
[25:29] season and some are at a wedding up in
[25:31] Edmonton. So, we want to say God bless
[25:33] you to them.

[41:03] Hallelujah.
[41:06] &gt;&gt; Well,
[41:08] praise God.
[41:10] &gt;&gt; I'll have you turn in the scriptures to
[41:13] Romans the 12th chapter.
[41:19] And uh while we're reading the
[41:21] scriptures, you do what I've been doing
[41:23] for a couple of weeks now and just say,
[41:25] "God,
[41:26] uh step in in a special way and help me
[41:30] &gt;&gt; to grasp
[41:32] uh the revelation of your word. Help the
[41:35] minister to speak
[41:38] &gt;&gt; and give me ears to hear."
[41:40] &gt;&gt; Amen. And and I believe all will go
[41:42] well.
[41:44] I want to feed.
[41:46] &gt;&gt; And I prayed that the great shepherd
[41:48] would feed the sheep today.
[41:52] &gt;&gt; When you feed and have a good meal,
[41:54] you're strengthened. You're comforted.
[41:58] Amen.
[42:00] Just before we read, we'll pray.
[42:02] Father, I so thank you for this group of
[42:06] people that have gathered,
[42:08] for all that are with us and even saying
[42:10] amen that are streaming.
[42:13] all that may ever hear this service,
[42:15] Lord, that you would have ordained it to
[42:18] go and to them to their personal walk,
[42:22] their personal life. I pray, Father,
[42:25] that you will inspire us with a holy
[42:27] divine inspiration.
[42:30] I ask that you'll give utterance, oh
[42:32] God, to my lips, that they'll cause them
[42:34] to say just what you'd have said.
[42:36] There's somebody here, Lord. There's
[42:38] some some one of your children, your
[42:40] sons and your daughters, and you want to
[42:43] speak to them. You want to become very
[42:45] near to them today, personal. You want
[42:48] to touch them. You want to give uh them
[42:50] supernatural strength and virtue. And I
[42:53] pray, oh God, that this service will be
[42:55] a supernatural service. Lord, touch
[42:58] every life. Rebuke the enemy, our foe,
[43:01] your archeneemy. Rebuke him, oh God, and
[43:05] bring him down. And may this service,
[43:07] Father, I pray in eternity it will go
[43:10] down in record as having a victorious
[43:13] effect for the bride of Jesus Christ and
[43:17] a great defeat for the enemy. This is
[43:19] our prayer in Jesus Christ's name. We
[43:22] surrender ourselves to you now
[43:24] completely and we thank you. Amen.
[43:29] All right. In Romans the 12th chapter,
[43:32] you're going to read verses 1 and two.
[43:35] I beseech you therefore, brethren, by
[43:37] the mercies of God, that you present
[43:40] your bodies a living sacrifice, holy,
[43:43] acceptable unto God, which is your
[43:46] reasonable service, and be not conformed
[43:50] to this world, but be ye transformed by
[43:54] the renewing of your mind, that you may
[43:57] prove what is that good and acceptable
[43:59] and perfect will of God. I have a second
[44:03] reading and it'll be in Genesis the 3
[44:05] chapter.
[44:13] We'll begin reading at verse 4.
[44:28] Chapter 3 begins and tells us the how
[44:31] subtle the serpent was, more subtle than
[44:34] any beast of the field. And he asked Eve
[44:37] the woman whether they could eat of the
[44:40] trees of the garden.
[44:43] And she had answered that they could eat
[44:44] of the trees, but you shall not touch,
[44:47] neither shall you touch the
[44:51] uh but the fruit of the tree which is in
[44:53] the midst of the garden, you shall not
[44:54] touch it. And verse four, and the
[44:57] serpent said unto the woman, ye shall
[44:59] not surely die.
[45:02] For God doth know that in the day you
[45:06] eat thereof, then your eyes shall be
[45:09] opened, and you shall be as God's,
[45:12] knowing good and evil." And when the
[45:15] woman saw that the tree was good for
[45:18] food, and that it was pleasant to the
[45:21] eyes, and a tree to be desired to make
[45:24] one wise, she took of the fruit thereof,
[45:27] and did eat, and gave also unto her
[45:30] husband with her, and he did eat. You
[45:34] may be seated.
[45:36] You may wonder how these two
[45:38] scripture readings fit together. Well,
[45:41] they obviously have to fit together
[45:42] because it's Christ from Genesis to
[45:44] Revelation.
[45:46] So, nothing is nothing's different, but
[45:49] we just need to uh have have
[45:53] understanding. And I would like to say
[45:55] that when we go back and we read about
[45:58] the two trees in the garden, I want to I
[46:02] want to lay a lot of emphasis on the
[46:05] symbols of the tree of knowledge of good
[46:07] and evil and the tree of life.
[46:11] and you pray that God will give you
[46:13] personal your own personal revelation of
[46:17] how that's to be interpreted in your
[46:19] life because uh
[46:23] uh I can tell you that the the tree of
[46:26] knowledge of good and evil
[46:29] represents a power to
[46:34] conform
[46:36] to a power of influence to cause people
[46:39] to conform form
[46:41] and the tree of life is the power of
[46:45] life to transform.
[46:48] &gt;&gt; And so the two scriptures which we have
[46:50] read in Romans be not conformed
[46:56] &gt;&gt; but be transformed.
[46:58] They go right back to the two trees. One
[47:01] is the power with influence to cause the
[47:05] people of this day to conform
[47:09] &gt;&gt; and the other is the power to transform
[47:13] and they're completely different. I want
[47:15] to lay a lot of emphasis on the power of
[47:17] transformation
[47:19] but also uh this scripture be not
[47:24] conformed. I just have a couple of uh
[47:27] slides here that I want to bring to you.
[47:31] Conformed
[47:36] is to make or be like in form or
[47:40] character.
[47:43] to act or be in accord
[47:47] to act or fashion in accordance with
[47:50] current customs and modes or we could
[47:53] say fashions.
[47:56] It is to conform oneself to another's
[47:59] pattern.
[48:02] &gt;&gt; Conformed describes what is transistory,
[48:07] changeable and unstable.
[48:10] &gt;&gt; And I think that you need to Really keep
[48:13] that in mind. To be conformed what is
[48:17] con what has been conformed to describes
[48:21] what is transistory
[48:23] transitions. It just it's it's
[48:26] transistory changeable and unstable. And
[48:28] the reason for that is because the world
[48:31] is in a constant state of flux.
[48:35] &gt;&gt; It's constantly changing.
[48:37] &gt;&gt; So styles change.
[48:40] medical science, all sciences change and
[48:43] we are called upon to conform to those
[48:46] changes
[48:47] &gt;&gt; just to keep moving. And so it keeps
[48:49] people in a state of constant, you know,
[48:53] it really adds to the rat race if you
[48:56] want to put it that way. Everything
[48:58] changes, styles change, uh automobiles
[49:01] change, everything changes. Uh the whole
[49:04] tech the whole world of technology is
[49:07] changing so fast that you can scarcely
[49:10] keep up with it.
[49:12] &gt;&gt; You might as well say amen to that
[49:13] because that is the truth. And you'll
[49:15] get some object and have it for a few
[49:18] months and then it'll tell you it's just
[49:20] a boat anchor.
[49:22] &gt;&gt; You chuck that and take it to the
[49:24] recycle bin because it's not useful
[49:27] anymore. That is being conformed.
[49:30] Transformed however is is something
[49:33] different. To be transformed is to give
[49:37] a different form to
[49:40] to trans it was the same word that is
[49:42] used be ye be transformed is in in
[49:48] Matthew the 17th chapter when Jesus and
[49:51] took his disciples Matthew uh Mark I'm
[49:55] sorry uh Peter, James and John on the
[49:58] mount of transfiguration. And the Bible
[49:59] says he was transfigured before them
[50:03] which is the same same word. It's to
[50:06] alter in disposition and it or to
[50:09] convert and that uh the the to be
[50:14] conformed doesn't convert a person. It
[50:17] just kept them moving from one state to
[50:20] another.
[50:22] Now,
[50:24] brother Brandham in a message at the
[50:26] towards the end of his ministry in 1964
[50:29] in God's power to transform
[50:32] this quote here and everything under
[50:35] control to bring forth its kind.
[50:40] When he put the seed in the earth, the
[50:43] seed can only come forth with the power
[50:45] of life within it to transform it from
[50:49] seed to a plant. Now, that's not
[50:52] converting it uh in that sense of the
[50:55] word or it's not just changing its
[50:57] appearance. It's taking the life that's
[51:00] actually in the seed and bringing it
[51:02] forth to another form.
[51:05] &gt;&gt; But it's the same life all the time.
[51:07] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[51:09] And whatever it was, his transforming
[51:12] power, God put the seed in there with
[51:15] potentials that it would be what he said
[51:18] it would be. And that's key, that it
[51:21] would be what he said it would be. That
[51:24] all of that potential is in the seed to
[51:27] be what he said what he said it would
[51:30] be. And what he said was before it was
[51:33] seed. He spoke before it was seed. And
[51:36] then what he spoke the seed had to bring
[51:39] forth because he had said it he said it
[51:41] out of his own desire out of his own
[51:42] thoughts. And uh and incidentally I'll
[51:46] just say because I'm going to come to
[51:48] it. You have before you were born God
[51:52] had already not only given thought but
[51:55] spoke a seed word or a word seed that is
[52:01] actually he ties it to your soul. That's
[52:04] why you've craved you crave something
[52:07] the world could never satisfy. You crave
[52:10] something religion could never satisfy.
[52:13] You crave something that just uh just a
[52:16] message formality will never satisfy.
[52:20] It'll never satisfy it because your soul
[52:23] craves for something further because God
[52:26] spoke it
[52:28] &gt;&gt; in the beginning. And as long as it
[52:31] stayed in its right category, it would
[52:34] be just exactly what God said it would
[52:37] be.
[52:38] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[52:39] &gt;&gt; And each one of those seeds has power in
[52:42] itself to transform itself.
[52:47] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[52:48] &gt;&gt; That seed life that's in you doesn't
[52:52] depend on your efforts. It depends on
[52:55] and it doesn't depend on how grand the
[52:58] church might get to be or the music or
[53:01] anything else. It doesn't depend on
[53:03] that. It depends on the craving of the
[53:06] soul. And God has put in that soul to
[53:10] transform you, transform itself into
[53:13] what God had in his mind in the first
[53:16] place. It's already resident there. All
[53:18] the potentials are there. And what you
[53:21] are experiencing spiritually is the
[53:23] product of that potential.
[53:25] &gt;&gt; I feel I want to really make that a a
[53:28] very important part of it. So power in
[53:31] itself to transform itself into the
[53:34] species that I desire it to be. Now let
[53:38] me just stop there. The prophet speaks
[53:40] of a super race. And I know that when he
[53:42] says that you might feel, well, I don't
[53:45] really feel very super. I don't feel I'm
[53:47] part of a super race. That has nothing
[53:49] to do with that.
[53:50] &gt;&gt; That has absolutely nothing to do with
[53:52] it. You can't dilute the word of God.
[53:54] You can't make God's word less powerful
[53:56] than it is. I mean, when God thinks
[53:59] something and he speaks something and he
[54:01] says, "And it shall be." There's no way
[54:03] to change that. That's what you're going
[54:05] to be. You're predestinated to be that.
[54:08] And whatever he ordained you to be, the
[54:10] best for for you to do is to agree with
[54:12] him.
[54:13] &gt;&gt; Say, "He said through a prophet's voice,
[54:15] it's a super race." All right. That's a
[54:18] good enough for me. It's a super race.
[54:20] And then the devil comes around, wants
[54:22] to point you to this and point you to
[54:23] that failure, point you to something
[54:25] else. You can just say, "Get behind me.
[54:27] Get behind me, Satan. I don't care what
[54:30] weakness you point to. I don't care what
[54:31] failure you point to. I don't care what
[54:34] you to point to. This is what has been
[54:36] declared by God. And that's exactly what
[54:39] it's going to be.
[54:41] &gt;&gt; And I possess the potential. If I what
[54:44] I'm lacking, I already I already have
[54:46] what I'm lacking.
[54:49] &gt;&gt; I already possess what I'm lacking. You
[54:52] already possess it.
[54:54] &gt;&gt; What you're lacking. Would you agree
[54:55] with that?
[54:57] &gt;&gt; All right.
[54:59] That's what it must be because I have
[55:02] given every seed transforming power to
[55:05] make out of itself in in its potentials.
[55:09] now to make out of itself exactly what I
[55:13] want it to be. God has never changed.
[55:16] Just the same today as he was then. God
[55:19] is determined to do something. He He'll
[55:23] do it and nothing's going to stop him
[55:29] &gt;&gt; in God's provided way. In the Garden of
[55:33] Eden, there were two trees. One of them
[55:35] was the tree of life, the other the tree
[55:37] of death. or the tree of knowledge. And
[55:41] when man left the tree of life to eat
[55:44] from the tree of knowledge, the first
[55:46] bite he took, he separated himself from
[55:49] his maker. There's two trees, two seeds,
[55:54] &gt;&gt; two natures, two destinies, one to life
[55:57] and one to death.
[56:00] &gt;&gt; And that's where I'm wanting to go.
[56:04] &gt;&gt; Amen. I turn the lights back on.
[56:10] So that's why I feel it was necessary
[56:12] and we needed to go back to Genesis to
[56:15] get the uh to get the setting
[56:20] for
[56:21] being conformed or not
[56:24] be not conformed to this world. And this
[56:29] world is a changing world, rapidly
[56:31] changing world. And so if you if you
[56:35] decide to conform to it, you young
[56:37] people here, I can tell you if the time
[56:40] should go on and the Lord Jesus terries,
[56:43] by the time 20 years goes by, this world
[56:46] will be pressuring you to conform all
[56:48] the way along.
[56:51] &gt;&gt; And the colors will change and the
[56:53] styles will change and the fashion will
[56:55] change and the automobiles and the boats
[56:57] and everything else. the housing will
[56:59] change, building materials will change,
[57:01] everything will very very few things.
[57:04] Brother Brennan even pointed out, he
[57:05] said, "Now, if if you, you know, if you
[57:09] use the same medical
[57:12] uh
[57:14] the
[57:16] medical treatment of a 100 years ago,
[57:20] uh they they think you're crazy, you
[57:23] know, pull a fingernail or something and
[57:25] bleed you a bit to get rid of something
[57:29] and tell you they didn't know anything
[57:31] about, oh, they're making such
[57:33] advancements.
[57:34] Uh I heard a man I heard a man on the
[57:37] radio. They were interviewing him. He
[57:39] was a uh really an advanced in the
[57:42] medical world and the research and they
[57:45] asked him
[57:47] what do you see 20 years from now?
[57:51] Well he said that's hard that's very
[57:53] very difficult question to answer. But
[57:55] he said what about operations without
[57:57] blood?
[57:59] And the the announcer, he's startled. He
[58:02] says, "Pardon?" He said, "Yeah, how how
[58:04] about operations without blood, without
[58:06] any bleeding." And so, I mean, he's
[58:10] going way out there where even the man
[58:12] who was asking him couldn't know. How do
[58:14] we know what's in the future? We we we
[58:17] if we just look back, no wonder no
[58:19] wonder the prophets were considered mad.
[58:23] &gt;&gt; Insane people
[58:24] &gt;&gt; because what they were prophesying about
[58:26] our prophesying about the chariots
[58:29] jostling in the streets and all. Well,
[58:31] you're you're in the chariots right now.
[58:34] &gt;&gt; You're the one you you you you call it a
[58:37] gridlock.
[58:38] Uh that isn't what they call it, but
[58:40] that's what you call it because things
[58:42] have changed and and and we've conformed
[58:45] along with it. But be ye not conformed
[58:48] to this world, but be transformed by the
[58:52] renewing of your mind.
[58:54] &gt;&gt; So you get the mind of God instead of
[58:56] the mind of the world. Be transformed.
[58:59] &gt;&gt; And the power that's in you, all you
[59:01] have to do is believe in it.
[59:04] &gt;&gt; You do you do that? I'm sure.
[59:07] All right. In the garden was these two
[59:08] trees, two trees, two seeds, two
[59:11] natures, two destinies, one to life and
[59:15] one to death. And Jesus said, now the
[59:18] tree comes in physical form. He was the
[59:21] tree. He Jesus said, "I'm the way.
[59:25] &gt;&gt; I'm the truth.
[59:27] &gt;&gt; I'm the life.
[59:29] &gt;&gt; He's the tree of life.
[59:32] &gt;&gt; And no man cometh to the father but by
[59:34] me."
[59:36] Now the reason I want to just I I
[59:40] inserted that scripture there is because
[59:42] between the tree of life and the tree of
[59:46] knowledge of good and evil here and over
[59:48] in Revelation is only the tree of life
[59:51] is because
[59:53] God the word became flesh
[59:57] and and
[59:59] he didn't just become flesh.
[1:00:02] Watch it closely now.
[1:00:05] He
[1:00:07] He died. He went to death. He took that
[1:00:11] body of flesh to death, which was the
[1:00:14] sentence. But he gave it a resurrection.
[1:00:17] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:00:18] &gt;&gt; That was unheard of.
[1:00:20] &gt;&gt; Others were brought from the dead,
[1:00:22] &gt;&gt; but Jesus Christ had a resurrection.
[1:00:25] &gt;&gt; He had a different body.
[1:00:27] &gt;&gt; Others came back from the dead, but they
[1:00:29] lived out their life and died again. But
[1:00:32] he came back from the dead and was
[1:00:34] resurrected. Elijah was translated. But
[1:00:39] but Jesus died
[1:00:41] &gt;&gt; and was resurrected
[1:00:43] &gt;&gt; and was transl trans transformed into
[1:00:46] another body
[1:00:47] &gt;&gt; and he showed that be on the mount
[1:00:49] transfiguration. He was transfigured. He
[1:00:52] was transformed which is the same word
[1:00:55] be ye transformed
[1:00:58] &gt;&gt; by the renewing. Be ye transformed. And
[1:01:01] and it says that we will have a body
[1:01:03] like unto his glorious body. Listen
[1:01:07] friends, this is a you might say, well,
[1:01:09] you know, if we always put things up in
[1:01:11] the future, our future is the brightest
[1:01:14] future.
[1:01:15] &gt;&gt; We can't look back or even looking to
[1:01:17] the future here in this world, it's not
[1:01:20] a pleasant it's not a pleasant thing.
[1:01:22] Look at the world today. I don't want to
[1:01:24] even get into it. It's a total chaos
[1:01:26] until I received a letter just a day or
[1:01:28] two ago and a brother says, you know, he
[1:01:31] says, "It seems to me we're in a
[1:01:32] tribulation.
[1:01:34] &gt;&gt; Everywhere you look, there isn't good
[1:01:36] news. It's a tribulation. The world is
[1:01:38] in a convulsion.
[1:01:41] &gt;&gt; Even the earth is convulsing.
[1:01:43] &gt;&gt; And the pollution and all of these
[1:01:45] things is just a convulsion. And the
[1:01:48] prophet said, the prophet has already
[1:01:50] said it can't it can't afford it can't
[1:01:54] take or handle a third birth pain. He
[1:01:57] said it will bring it right into a new
[1:01:59] heaven and a new earth. Amen.
[1:02:03] &gt;&gt; So one had to come in between
[1:02:06] between Eden and between Revelation with
[1:02:09] mortal life and then he took the death
[1:02:12] paid the penalty crushed the head of the
[1:02:15] serpent and that's why in Revelation you
[1:02:18] don't find the tree of knowledge of good
[1:02:20] and evil anymore. He's gone.
[1:02:23] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. He's gone. Rejoice all ye
[1:02:25] saints that believe the word of God.
[1:02:27] He's gone.
[1:02:30] You won't have him to contend with
[1:02:32] anymore.
[1:02:34] &gt;&gt; You want some good news? That's good
[1:02:36] news.
[1:02:38] &gt;&gt; That's the gospel.
[1:02:40] &gt;&gt; He's not there. And he's not there
[1:02:42] because the tree of life from Eden
[1:02:43] became flesh.
[1:02:44] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:02:45] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And took the penalty. He
[1:02:48] stood there while they ate from the
[1:02:50] other tree. He stood there and he took
[1:02:52] the penalty and crushed the head of the
[1:02:54] serpent.
[1:02:56] &gt;&gt; And he's he's not in existence anymore.
[1:03:00] Hallelujah.
[1:03:02] &gt;&gt; So the tree of knowledge versus the tree
[1:03:04] of life.
[1:03:07] &gt;&gt; The good in the tree of knowledge.
[1:03:12] &gt;&gt; The good in the tree of knowledge.
[1:03:15] &gt;&gt; It's a tree of knowledge of good and
[1:03:18] evil.
[1:03:19] &gt;&gt; But the good in the tree of knowledge is
[1:03:22] never to be compared with
[1:03:25] &gt;&gt; the life from the tree of life.
[1:03:31] There is good
[1:03:35] &gt;&gt; say I'm I'm a hunter. Lots of brothers
[1:03:37] here are hunters waiting for the hunting
[1:03:39] season now. So they'll take
[1:03:44] their bullets
[1:03:46] which come from the tree of knowledge.
[1:03:49] &gt;&gt; The gunpowder in them the prophet even
[1:03:52] said come from the tree of knowledge.
[1:03:55] because he'll go out and he'll say,
[1:03:57] "Well, I'll go and get myself an animal
[1:03:59] and I'll get some meat for my family.
[1:04:01] That's good."
[1:04:04] But then the same bullet goes and kills
[1:04:06] a man in war
[1:04:09] &gt;&gt; and it's evil.
[1:04:11] So a man will take, he's not sinning if
[1:04:14] he takes up his gun, but don't forget it
[1:04:18] came from the tree of knowledge.
[1:04:20] &gt;&gt; And it's not a sin when he buys a box of
[1:04:23] bullets. But just remember it come from
[1:04:26] the tree of knowledge,
[1:04:27] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:04:28] &gt;&gt; And he goes out and he gets his animal
[1:04:30] and he brings the meat home.
[1:04:32] That's fine. He's fed his family, maybe
[1:04:35] fed guests and whatever more. And it's
[1:04:38] good.
[1:04:40] But he said, well, you know,
[1:04:43] the tree of knowledge, the life from the
[1:04:46] tree of knowledge always has to control
[1:04:50] the tree of I mean, the life from the
[1:04:52] tree of life has to control the good in
[1:04:57] the tree of knowledge.
[1:04:59] &gt;&gt; And he says, "Well, you know what? Uh,
[1:05:02] I'm just going to get away a little
[1:05:04] early. I don't really care to, you know,
[1:05:06] I don't necessarily need to be in church
[1:05:08] anyway and I'll go hunting on on Sunday.
[1:05:11] Now, that's not good.
[1:05:17] &gt;&gt; You know, this might be symbolic, but
[1:05:19] you're going to it's going to get so
[1:05:21] down to earth. You say, "Can't we have
[1:05:23] something deep?"
[1:05:27] So, there's all kinds of things. Well,
[1:05:30] uh uh you know the the life from the
[1:05:36] tree of life which we have in us needs
[1:05:39] to control
[1:05:41] our our daily activities.
[1:05:45] You in education,
[1:05:47] you in your jobs, you in your business,
[1:05:50] you in your off time, you in your
[1:05:53] vacation, you in your relaxation,
[1:05:56] whatever more. The tree of life needs to
[1:06:00] control that.
[1:06:01] &gt;&gt; And the tree of life needs to in infuse
[1:06:05] you with the gift of discernment so you
[1:06:08] can discern between the two. And
[1:06:10] sometimes it's not easy.
[1:06:13] Sometimes it's not easy.
[1:06:16] You really need to have the gift of
[1:06:19] discernment.
[1:06:21] Now,
[1:06:24] some of these things you may know. Some
[1:06:25] of these things you may have never
[1:06:26] heard,
[1:06:29] but in the Ephesian church age, brother
[1:06:31] Brandham says, "Religion and the
[1:06:34] spiritual world are made of those two
[1:06:37] trees
[1:06:38] which had their roots in Eden. Both the
[1:06:42] tree of life and the tree of knowledge
[1:06:45] of good and evil stood in the midst of
[1:06:48] the garden and no doubt
[1:06:51] no doubt their very branches intertwined
[1:06:55] with one another
[1:06:58] or with each other. He says the church
[1:07:01] is made up now the church is made up of
[1:07:04] good and bad. Two vines make the church.
[1:07:09] They are like the wheat and the tears
[1:07:12] growing up side by side. But one is the
[1:07:15] true and the other is the false. Now God
[1:07:19] will speak to each one and he will talk
[1:07:24] about each one. He will call them the
[1:07:28] church and only the elect will really
[1:07:32] know which is the true spirit. Only the
[1:07:35] elect will not be deceived. Right. Amen.
[1:07:39] &gt;&gt; Now, that's one you really need to say
[1:07:40] amen to. That's one you need to if you
[1:07:43] want to. It's it's Ephesians church ages
[1:07:46] 92-3
[1:07:48] the paragraph.
[1:07:51] So he said no doubt their branches
[1:07:54] intertwined each other. Now I I want to
[1:07:58] bring something out very quickly here. I
[1:08:00] have it further in my message, but
[1:08:03] brother Brandham talks about the corn,
[1:08:06] stalks of corn, and while he was out
[1:08:10] walking one day, he sees a branch that
[1:08:12] is tore off in uh it fell off of a tree
[1:08:15] and it fell across a stock of corn and
[1:08:18] how that corn struggles. Now, he's
[1:08:22] talking about a corn, true corn, being
[1:08:25] deformed. Yes.
[1:08:27] &gt;&gt; You see this is what happens if we a
[1:08:31] real son and daughter of God. They can
[1:08:34] come under the influence of conformity
[1:08:37] and the power of conformity until the
[1:08:40] until the author until Satan himself
[1:08:44] causes a deformity. But he said yet it's
[1:08:48] still corn. Right?
[1:08:50] &gt;&gt; So now it's not just true or false, but
[1:08:52] a true one can can come under a
[1:08:55] deformity.
[1:08:58] &gt;&gt; Become deformed because but if you lift
[1:09:01] that branch off, if you get rid of that
[1:09:04] thing that's causing the deformity, then
[1:09:06] it'll come back straight again
[1:09:09] &gt;&gt; because that's the power that's in the
[1:09:11] seed. Amen.
[1:09:14] &gt;&gt; So the two trees now also speak of
[1:09:17] relationship.
[1:09:20] &gt;&gt; They speak of relationship
[1:09:23] because they they speak of seed as well.
[1:09:28] So the two trees speak of relationship.
[1:09:31] Before Eve received the seed of the
[1:09:35] serpent, she had refused the word of God
[1:09:40] because God had already spoken. And that
[1:09:43] was God's seed word.
[1:09:45] &gt;&gt; He had already spoken. So she turned
[1:09:48] that down and turned her ear this other
[1:09:50] way and she refused the word or the seed
[1:09:54] of the tree of life. She had accepted uh
[1:09:58] this is from a quote from the end time
[1:10:01] seed sign. She had accepted a seed of
[1:10:04] unbelief.
[1:10:06] And I've I've
[1:10:10] used that phrase seed of unbelief before
[1:10:12] I even know that brother Brandham had
[1:10:14] used it. So I want you to pay real
[1:10:16] strict attention. She had accepted a
[1:10:19] seed of unbelief against God's word
[1:10:23] because it produced something to her
[1:10:26] more brighter
[1:10:28] &gt;&gt; and she wanted more knowledge.
[1:10:31] &gt;&gt; And then he said later there was a
[1:10:33] defilement in the womb of her thinking
[1:10:37] &gt;&gt; before it was in her physical womb. It
[1:10:40] was in the womb of her thinking. a
[1:10:42] defilement because she'd already started
[1:10:46] turned from uh from the commandment of
[1:10:49] God to what the serpent was telling her
[1:10:52] and and Satan himself was speaking
[1:10:54] through that being.
[1:10:57] &gt;&gt; Is that too much for you? I'm sure not.
[1:11:00] &gt;&gt; So, there was a defilement of the womb
[1:11:02] of her thinking. Just a little later in
[1:11:05] the same paragraph, Satan the serpent
[1:11:08] got to Eve before Adam got to her.
[1:11:12] that's in Satan's Eden. So, in a in a
[1:11:15] sense, both trees have seed. Seed is
[1:11:20] associated. There's a relationship. They
[1:11:23] both symbolize a relationship. Now, they
[1:11:27] both symbolize a seed
[1:11:29] &gt;&gt; because they both have a seed. One is
[1:11:31] the seed of unbelief
[1:11:33] &gt;&gt; and the other is the seed of the word of
[1:11:35] God.
[1:11:36] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:11:38] And so further in the Ephesians church
[1:11:40] age
[1:11:42] said before Adam ever had coral
[1:11:44] knowledge with Eve the serpent had that
[1:11:48] knowledge ahead of him and that one born
[1:11:53] of it was Cain.
[1:11:56] &gt;&gt; I'm going slowly deliberately.
[1:11:59] I would like to have had this all up but
[1:12:00] I didn't want you just to be reading
[1:12:02] ahead of me. So that one that was born
[1:12:05] of it was Cain. Now listen to this. This
[1:12:08] is startling. Cain was born of and he
[1:12:12] says begotten of that wicked one.
[1:12:16] According to first John 3 and2 Cain who
[1:12:19] was of that wicked one, the devil.
[1:12:22] &gt;&gt; Now and now this is against those who
[1:12:25] can't see the serpent seed. Just listen
[1:12:27] to this. Cain was a born was uh was of
[1:12:32] or born of or begotten of that wicked
[1:12:35] one. 1 John 3:12. The Holy Spirit in
[1:12:40] John could not in one place call Adam
[1:12:44] the wicked one
[1:12:46] &gt;&gt; if he was Adam's son.
[1:12:48] &gt;&gt; How could the Holy Ghost call
[1:12:52] Adam the wicked one? for that is what he
[1:12:56] would have that is what he would be if
[1:12:59] he fathered Cain and in another place
[1:13:02] called Adam the son of God
[1:13:05] &gt;&gt; according to uh according to Luke 3:38.
[1:13:08] So he couldn't be called the son of God
[1:13:10] in one place and called the wicked one
[1:13:12] in another place by the same Holy
[1:13:14] Spirit. You understand then the Holy
[1:13:16] Ghost is the author of this word. I tell
[1:13:18] you, you know, the serpent seed is a
[1:13:20] very powerful and very fundamental and
[1:13:23] is a pillar truth not only of the
[1:13:25] message but of the of the entire gospel.
[1:13:29] &gt;&gt; And you'll that's why it was blood from
[1:13:31] Genesis right through to Revelation.
[1:13:33] That's why they had to be circumcised.
[1:13:35] They say that circumcision had something
[1:13:37] to do with the uh with the cleanliness.
[1:13:40] That had not it had nothing to do. God
[1:13:42] was marking that part of the male body,
[1:13:44] letting the whole chosen people of
[1:13:47] Israel know that he was going to bring
[1:13:49] redemption without that human
[1:13:51] instrumentality.
[1:13:53] &gt;&gt; And that's why Mary had to have a b a a
[1:13:57] virgin birth. A birth. She was a virgin.
[1:14:00] She had a conception. She had the child
[1:14:02] in her. She was still a virgin. And
[1:14:04] Jesus was born uh of a virgin birth.
[1:14:08] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:14:10] So in a sense both of these trees had
[1:14:13] seed
[1:14:15] and he said he could not be called both
[1:14:17] the wicked one and the and the uh son of
[1:14:20] god at the same time.
[1:14:23] Cain turned out I've read this two or
[1:14:25] three times to catch the impact of it
[1:14:27] myself. Cain turned out in character
[1:14:31] like his father.
[1:14:33] &gt;&gt; A bringer of death. That's the first
[1:14:36] thing he did was bring death.
[1:14:38] a murderer.
[1:14:41] &gt;&gt; He his utter defiance of God when faced
[1:14:44] by the Almighty in Genesis 4 59 13 and
[1:14:48] 14 show him to be absolutely unhumanlike
[1:14:54] in characteristics seeming even to
[1:14:57] surpass any account we have in the
[1:15:00] scripture concerning a confrontation of
[1:15:03] Satan by God.
[1:15:05] This is one of the greatest
[1:15:07] confrontations and conversations that
[1:15:10] took place. Cain spoke more than the
[1:15:13] devil has spoke in an absolute
[1:15:15] confrontation with God. And he he lied.
[1:15:19] He was a murderer.
[1:15:21] &gt;&gt; And that's the fruit. And you could
[1:15:23] never attribute that to Adam.
[1:15:26] &gt;&gt; What why do I say all that? Why do I put
[1:15:28] this emphasis? Not just to establish a
[1:15:30] serpent seed doctrine, but to say to you
[1:15:33] that that was what was in the seed.
[1:15:36] That's what he was.
[1:15:38] &gt;&gt; And what he was had to come out.
[1:15:41] &gt;&gt; He was sown in unbelief.
[1:15:47] &gt;&gt; He said the in Ephesians church age
[1:15:50] again he said the tree of knowledge
[1:15:52] produced clever men
[1:15:54] &gt;&gt; and men of renown.
[1:15:57] used to take men of renown and the and
[1:15:59] those were the ones rose up against
[1:16:01] Moses.
[1:16:02] &gt;&gt; He said, "The tree of knowledge has
[1:16:04] produced clever men and men of renown,
[1:16:07] but their ways are the ways of death.
[1:16:11] &gt;&gt; God's people are simple,
[1:16:13] &gt;&gt; but spiritually minded,
[1:16:15] &gt;&gt; leaning toward God and nature, calmly
[1:16:19] tilling the soil, caring for truth
[1:16:22] rather than for wealth. The seed of the
[1:16:25] serpent has brought tremendous commerce,
[1:16:28] wonderful in inventions, but with it all
[1:16:31] comes death.
[1:16:34] &gt;&gt; Their gunpowder and atomic bombs kill in
[1:16:37] war and in peace time. Their mechanical
[1:16:40] inventions such as the car kill even
[1:16:43] more in the time of peace than do the
[1:16:45] inventions of inventions of war to
[1:16:48] destroy in times of trouble. Death and
[1:16:51] destruction are the fruits of her
[1:16:53] labors.
[1:16:57] &gt;&gt; The nature of Satan was injected and
[1:17:00] this is very very intriguing to me and I
[1:17:03] trust it will be uh something that you
[1:17:06] might not need it today, you might not
[1:17:08] need it tomorrow, but if you take this
[1:17:11] and put it in your script bag, I'm sure
[1:17:13] it will be helpful to you. So the nature
[1:17:17] we can say well
[1:17:19] okay how does this how do the effect how
[1:17:23] did that nature
[1:17:25] get into the into the seed? How how did
[1:17:28] how was that nature injected in and uh
[1:17:32] how does the nature of God
[1:17:35] uh being restored through Jesus Christ.
[1:17:38] So the nature of Satan was injected into
[1:17:41] the human liferee
[1:17:44] through hybrid.
[1:17:46] &gt;&gt; Remember now he is not a creator.
[1:17:49] &gt;&gt; He is a perverter.
[1:17:51] &gt;&gt; He's not a transformer. He's a
[1:17:53] conformer. Right.
[1:17:58] &gt;&gt; So now the nature
[1:18:00] now in leadership last service brother
[1:18:03] Brandon preached he said God gave you
[1:18:06] five senses
[1:18:08] not to contact him
[1:18:11] &gt;&gt; your earthly home you see taste feel
[1:18:14] smell and hear. Then you have a spirit
[1:18:17] on the inside of that and it has five
[1:18:20] outlets. Conscience, love and so forth.
[1:18:23] And you contact the spirit world through
[1:18:26] that. But with your spirit, your
[1:18:29] physical contacts the physical. Your
[1:18:33] spiritual contacts the spiritual. But
[1:18:36] inside of that,
[1:18:38] he's talking about spiritual. Not
[1:18:40] talking spiritual in the sense of of the
[1:18:42] of the supernatural or of God, but your
[1:18:45] spirit realm contacts the spirit. That's
[1:18:48] why brother Brandham would say, I take
[1:18:50] every spirit under my control
[1:18:54] &gt;&gt; for the glory of God. That's what I'm
[1:18:56] saying. What comes from the tree of life
[1:18:59] has to control
[1:19:01] &gt;&gt; the rest.
[1:19:02] &gt;&gt; And because the human spirit, you know
[1:19:05] well yourself, you can have all kinds of
[1:19:07] emotions.
[1:19:09] They're not of God.
[1:19:11] &gt;&gt; You can have emotions that are of God
[1:19:14] because if you have a you have a
[1:19:16] supernatural experience, you'll have
[1:19:18] some emotion.
[1:19:19] &gt;&gt; That's perfectly fine. But there's all
[1:19:22] kinds of emotions. And I would say for
[1:19:23] the most part emotions emotions don't
[1:19:26] trust them
[1:19:28] &gt;&gt; because they're so close to the spirit.
[1:19:31] &gt;&gt; Only the word of God. For the word of
[1:19:33] God is quick and powerful, sharper than
[1:19:37] any two-edged sword, dividing even to
[1:19:41] the dividing aunder of soul and spirit,
[1:19:45] not of body and spirit, but soul and
[1:19:47] spirit. So only the word of God can
[1:19:50] divide and discern what is of of the
[1:19:54] human nature and what is of the God
[1:19:56] nature
[1:19:57] &gt;&gt; and give a person a a an understanding
[1:20:01] this is of God because it agrees with
[1:20:04] the word of God.
[1:20:05] &gt;&gt; If it doesn't agree with the word of God
[1:20:07] then it just come from the world.
[1:20:10] &gt;&gt; It came from the conforming to the
[1:20:12] world.
[1:20:15] &gt;&gt; All right. He says, "And but in the
[1:20:17] inside,
[1:20:19] in that beneath that spirit realm,
[1:20:22] inside of that, you've got a soul. And
[1:20:26] that soul is that gene that come from
[1:20:30] God."
[1:20:31] &gt;&gt; So inside of you, you can't see it, you
[1:20:34] can't handle it, but inside of you, you
[1:20:38] have a soul. And that soul is the gene
[1:20:42] of God. It come from God. If it didn't
[1:20:45] come from God, if you don't have that
[1:20:48] really,
[1:20:50] then the gospel is not for you.
[1:20:54] &gt;&gt; But if you have that gene of God and so
[1:20:57] how, brother Bisc, how do I know I have
[1:20:59] that gene of God? Well, it's not
[1:21:01] satisfied. It's not satisfied with the
[1:21:04] superficial experience to begin with.
[1:21:07] It's not satisfied with that. It's not
[1:21:10] even satisfied with just being blessed.
[1:21:13] all kinds of people not satisfied with
[1:21:16] say a healing or a supernatural
[1:21:18] something. We're not satisfied. We we we
[1:21:21] desire and hunger and thirst after
[1:21:23] something that is more a reality
[1:21:26] &gt;&gt; that is beyond that.
[1:21:28] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:21:29] &gt;&gt; And the seed of God, the gene of God,
[1:21:33] can do nothing but bring forth what God
[1:21:36] had in his mind in the first place. And
[1:21:38] it will bring forth a masterpiece for
[1:21:40] sure. It will bring forth a spotless
[1:21:44] pure holy son and daughter of God. And
[1:21:47] there's nothing that will satisfy a
[1:21:49] believer other than that.
[1:21:54] &gt;&gt; So the soul now
[1:21:56] he said that soul is the gene that come
[1:21:59] from God.
[1:22:02] He said also in the token there's a
[1:22:05] blood because the blood had to be shed.
[1:22:08] In the animal,
[1:22:10] there's a blood,
[1:22:12] there's a life, a blood, there's a
[1:22:15] blood, a life, and a soul in the life.
[1:22:21] And he said the soul is the nature of
[1:22:24] the life. Now this I wanted to come down
[1:22:28] to this point. So now we're talking
[1:22:30] about the nature.
[1:22:33] So when God
[1:22:36] when God was speaking forth his word
[1:22:40] and as I said last time I spoke here it
[1:22:44] wasn't just did he speak Hebrew
[1:22:48] did he speak
[1:22:50] some other language
[1:22:52] no was there some verbaliz verbal sound
[1:22:56] verbalizing or vocalizing of the I don't
[1:23:00] know all I know is that went out from
[1:23:03] him.
[1:23:04] &gt;&gt; Now, just to give you kind of where I'm
[1:23:07] going, I want you to think deep about
[1:23:10] this.
[1:23:12] Now, the woman that came and touched the
[1:23:14] hem of his garment.
[1:23:18] She didn't hear any particular sound.
[1:23:22] She didn't hear him commanding her or
[1:23:25] saying to her, "If you just come, if you
[1:23:27] just press through this crowd, if you
[1:23:29] just reach out your hand, if you just
[1:23:31] grab a hold of my garment," she didn't
[1:23:33] hear any sound.
[1:23:35] &gt;&gt; Are you with me?
[1:23:37] &gt;&gt; But there was a language. There was
[1:23:38] something that she was hearing. There
[1:23:41] was something forcing her, I must touch
[1:23:44] his garment.
[1:23:47] &gt;&gt; And there was a faith in her. There was
[1:23:49] a faith in her that was responding and
[1:23:52] somehow she knew and the Bible says that
[1:23:55] when she touched him, he felt virtue go
[1:23:59] out from him.
[1:24:01] &gt;&gt; Something went out from him and she
[1:24:04] received what went out from him. All I
[1:24:06] can say to you, I don't know what
[1:24:07] language God spoke, but when he thought
[1:24:09] of you, but something went out from God
[1:24:13] for this generation, for this age, for
[1:24:16] this time, and it went down into you as
[1:24:19] a being, and you were birthed into this
[1:24:22] world. God allowed you to have human
[1:24:24] parents. You came into this world, but
[1:24:27] inside of you is a soul that came from
[1:24:31] God. Didn't come from mom, dad. didn't
[1:24:34] come from Russia, Britain, or or some
[1:24:36] other country. It came from God. It came
[1:24:40] from heaven. And you were given that by
[1:24:44] predestination.
[1:24:46] And that seed will bring forth the life
[1:24:48] of God.
[1:24:50] &gt;&gt; It has nothing to do with anything
[1:24:52] human.
[1:24:53] &gt;&gt; It's God life.
[1:24:56] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And you will do what it
[1:24:59] tells you to do.
[1:25:01] Yes, sir.
[1:25:02] The preacher doesn't have to say,
[1:25:04] "You're not satisfied. You're not
[1:25:05] satisfied. You're craving for something
[1:25:07] else." It's you that's saying that
[1:25:09] because something inside is saying, "I
[1:25:12] crave something more.
[1:25:16] &gt;&gt; I crave more than just quotes.
[1:25:18] &gt;&gt; I crave more than just tapes. I crave
[1:25:21] more. I crave the one who gave it,
[1:25:26] &gt;&gt; the one who's speaking." Amen.
[1:25:29] &gt;&gt; So ask yourself, I'm trying to bring it
[1:25:31] on a very human, very, very down to
[1:25:33] earth level. Ask yourself what caused
[1:25:36] that woman to reach through? Who told
[1:25:39] her to do that? And then you'll
[1:25:41] understand better. When the prophet is
[1:25:43] trying to describe how things happen, he
[1:25:45] said he sees like a little light coming
[1:25:48] out of that great eternal being.
[1:25:51] &gt;&gt; That little light coming out. He's
[1:25:53] trying to describe it so he can see it.
[1:25:55] He said it's the logos. It's the word.
[1:25:59] &gt;&gt; It's the son of God.
[1:26:01] &gt;&gt; Something had to come out from God.
[1:26:04] &gt;&gt; And then it had to be transmitted. He
[1:26:08] talks about it being materialized one
[1:26:10] place. He talks about it uh uh he he
[1:26:13] talks about it being materialized and
[1:26:15] and and he speaks of that coming out
[1:26:17] from God. What came out from God? What
[1:26:21] what is it? Can you you can't see that
[1:26:23] soul. You can't feel that soul. But that
[1:26:26] came out from God.
[1:26:32] &gt;&gt; Came from God. Friends,
[1:26:34] &gt;&gt; if you have a soul, I'm talking about
[1:26:38] what came out into you was the nature of
[1:26:41] God.
[1:26:43] &gt;&gt; Because it's the nature, the soul, he
[1:26:45] said, is the nature of the life. Amen.
[1:26:49] &gt;&gt; And that is why you can't be content
[1:26:52] with just the world because the nature
[1:26:55] is the wrong nature.
[1:26:57] &gt;&gt; The nature wants fame. You don't want
[1:26:59] fame. That seed is not the the nature
[1:27:02] wants great wealth and great position.
[1:27:05] You don't want that. You don't crave for
[1:27:07] that. The nature doesn't want anything
[1:27:09] tainted with the world and uncleanness.
[1:27:12] And that's why you're offended. That's
[1:27:14] why you feel uh so uh almost uh violated
[1:27:19] when you see you walk down the street,
[1:27:21] you hear the music. I just said to my
[1:27:24] wife, I say it all the time. I said
[1:27:25] allum,
[1:27:29] we just have to tell them, I get
[1:27:30] nervous. I can't even eat.
[1:27:33] &gt;&gt; Tell them, please shut that down.
[1:27:35] &gt;&gt; And I'm very vocal with it. There's
[1:27:37] nobody here that is enjoying that. We're
[1:27:40] trying to visit. Everybody here is
[1:27:41] trying to visit. We can't even hear
[1:27:43] ourselves think.
[1:27:45] &gt;&gt; Who inspires that? The tree of
[1:27:48] knowledge.
[1:27:49] &gt;&gt; It didn't come from God. It violates a
[1:27:52] It violates a clean spirit.
[1:27:55] &gt;&gt; You don't want that.
[1:27:57] &gt;&gt; And the fashions of the world violates
[1:28:00] &gt;&gt; the spirit of God that's in us.
[1:28:02] &gt;&gt; Why? Because we have a different nature.
[1:28:05] &gt;&gt; It's the seed that's in you. The soul,
[1:28:08] the seed of God. That's the gene of God.
[1:28:13] &gt;&gt; Friends, you ought to be so thankful if
[1:28:15] you possess that.
[1:28:17] &gt;&gt; Brother Bram talks about he goes into a
[1:28:19] man's office, sees a bunch of pinups
[1:28:21] there and whatever more. He said it's
[1:28:24] that he he said he's feeding that demon.
[1:28:28] &gt;&gt; He's feeding another nature.
[1:28:34] &gt;&gt; So the soul is the nature of the life.
[1:28:36] Amen.
[1:28:38] &gt;&gt; And he says in the future home, your
[1:28:41] soul is part of God. An attribute of God
[1:28:46] &gt;&gt; displayed here on earth in a body.
[1:28:50] Here you are in a body.
[1:28:53] &gt;&gt; But the it's an attribute of God that's
[1:28:55] displayed here in the body. The body is
[1:28:58] to be redeemed. Now the soul's redeemed
[1:29:04] &gt;&gt; because it was in sin.
[1:29:07] &gt;&gt; The soul was in sin or the soul was in
[1:29:09] unbelief.
[1:29:11] So by injecting his own thoughts
[1:29:15] and I don't know just exactly this I
[1:29:17] can't make the full connection and I
[1:29:19] hope you don't think that I haven't
[1:29:22] studied enough. I've pondered this very
[1:29:24] very deep and prayed about it. I'm not
[1:29:26] trying to bring something deep to you,
[1:29:27] but maybe these are things you've
[1:29:29] thought about is is how does a a word of
[1:29:32] unbelief come
[1:29:34] and a person
[1:29:37] as Eve disbelieved
[1:29:39] and then Satan went in to save I mean
[1:29:42] I'm sorry Adam went in to save her and
[1:29:46] but somehow
[1:29:48] the very nature of Lucifer got
[1:29:51] transferred
[1:29:53] &gt;&gt; through that act. It got transferred.
[1:29:56] Unbelief, friends,
[1:29:58] &gt;&gt; is a is a terrible, terrible thing.
[1:30:03] &gt;&gt; Unbelief is so hated by God,
[1:30:06] &gt;&gt; he's going to eliminate the very source
[1:30:08] of it.
[1:30:09] &gt;&gt; And the serpent was changed in his
[1:30:11] physical structure and God is going to
[1:30:14] cast Satan and all of the angels which
[1:30:18] he deceived and cast them into a lake of
[1:30:20] fire. It's going to be annihilated
[1:30:23] &gt;&gt; and unbelief will be gone forever.
[1:30:26] &gt;&gt; You will never be tempted by unbelief
[1:30:28] &gt;&gt; again. I speak to every son and daughter
[1:30:31] of God. You will never be you'll never
[1:30:33] be uh tempted again by unbelief.
[1:30:36] &gt;&gt; You'll be never be tempted to disbelieve
[1:30:38] something from God.
[1:30:41] &gt;&gt; Even some within the message are are are
[1:30:44] inclined towards disbelieving what the
[1:30:47] prophet of God said. I tell you that is
[1:30:49] the most dangerous thing. Don't you ever
[1:30:52] be conformed to that.
[1:30:55] &gt;&gt; Don't you ever be moved to that.
[1:30:57] &gt;&gt; Say I am a believer
[1:30:59] &gt;&gt; and I believe every word.
[1:31:01] &gt;&gt; This is not a smorgus board where I pick
[1:31:03] and choose. I believe all that he said.
[1:31:07] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:31:08] &gt;&gt; Whether it suits me or whether it fits
[1:31:10] me or whether it makes me joyful or not.
[1:31:13] Sometimes it has to make us sad
[1:31:15] sometime. But it's the truth. And it's
[1:31:17] the truth. We must believe it.
[1:31:25] &gt;&gt; So in the Smyrnian church age,
[1:31:28] he said you tamper with God and you reap
[1:31:31] exactly what you injected.
[1:31:34] &gt;&gt; If you tamper with God, the prophet is
[1:31:37] saying then you reap what you injected,
[1:31:39] you're injecting something into it.
[1:31:42] He said, "Man ought to learn that from
[1:31:45] nature he has tampered with nature.
[1:31:49] He has injected his own ideas into
[1:31:52] nature and rearrange the molecules.
[1:31:56] Isn't this incredible? Before all of
[1:31:58] this uh hybriding of foods
[1:32:02] &gt;&gt; and and and all this recent very very
[1:32:06] very recent technology.
[1:32:09] In fact, as the governments are
[1:32:11] struggling
[1:32:12] and there's great resistance within the
[1:32:15] government, both Canada and the United
[1:32:16] States because you know their politics
[1:32:19] is corrupt and so they bend to the where
[1:32:22] the votes are the most or the pressures
[1:32:25] the most and the lobbying goes on
[1:32:28] fiercely
[1:32:29] &gt;&gt; and there's people said we want to know
[1:32:32] what we're eating,
[1:32:33] &gt;&gt; right? We want labels on the food that
[1:32:36] tell us whether it's half strawberry and
[1:32:38] half pig.
[1:32:42] &gt;&gt; That's not so far. That's not even so
[1:32:44] humorous, but it is the fact. We want to
[1:32:47] know what this is. We want to know
[1:32:49] what's in this grain. We want to know
[1:32:51] what's in this animal. We want to know
[1:32:53] what's been injected into it. And
[1:32:55] there's strong strong power up till now
[1:32:58] have been successful at saying no, we're
[1:33:01] not going to put it on the label
[1:33:04] &gt;&gt; and you're not going to know what you're
[1:33:06] eating.
[1:33:07] &gt;&gt; Well, I think that the I'm not into
[1:33:08] politics, but I believe we have a right
[1:33:10] to know.
[1:33:12] &gt;&gt; At least when I get a moose, I know that
[1:33:14] he's eaten the al tops off of alder
[1:33:17] trees cuz I can see where he bit off the
[1:33:19] altars and he eats some of the leaves
[1:33:21] off the altars. And I'm so amazed that
[1:33:23] God can turn that wood into meat.
[1:33:28] [Music]
[1:33:34] &gt;&gt; Anyway,
[1:33:35] &gt;&gt; it is true.
[1:33:36] &gt;&gt; Now, some of you folks have trouble with
[1:33:38] wild meat. It's not wild meat
[1:33:41] &gt;&gt; anymore than God's a wild manufacturer.
[1:33:46] &gt;&gt; It's the tamest meat and the calst meat
[1:33:48] in the world.
[1:33:50] Amen.
[1:33:54] &gt;&gt; At least I thought the hunters would
[1:33:55] shout amen and stand at their feet.
[1:33:58] What are you doing, brother Blake?
[1:34:04] Anyhow,
[1:34:08] &gt;&gt; so how' they inject this
[1:34:11] nature?
[1:34:13] He says, "And they
[1:34:15] has injected his own ideas into nature."
[1:34:19] That's the nature and the world and
[1:34:21] rearrange the molecules etc. And now
[1:34:24] he's reaping a whirlwind. He said now if
[1:34:27] you fool with nature you get a
[1:34:29] monstrosity
[1:34:31] &gt;&gt; and a backfire that will happen if you
[1:34:33] change the truth into a lie.
[1:34:36] &gt;&gt; The answer is you will breed.
[1:34:41] &gt;&gt; You ready?
[1:34:43] &gt;&gt; Said the answer is you'll breed an
[1:34:45] antichrist.
[1:34:46] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:34:49] Exactly right.
[1:34:51] &gt;&gt; You will.
[1:34:53] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:34:55] You'll breed an antichrist
[1:34:57] &gt;&gt; if you inject something that's against
[1:35:00] the word of God.
[1:35:02] &gt;&gt; Well, it might not just show up
[1:35:04] tomorrow, but he'll be a he'll be an
[1:35:06] unbeliever to the word of God. And you
[1:35:09] know, when a person sets on a direction
[1:35:11] to disbelieve, what's you know what
[1:35:13] really happens? They just disbelieve
[1:35:15] more
[1:35:16] &gt;&gt; and more
[1:35:17] &gt;&gt; and more all the time till they've
[1:35:20] disbelieved the whole word.
[1:35:22] &gt;&gt; People who have rejected the message,
[1:35:24] for example, they didn't start off one
[1:35:26] day and just said, you know what? I'm
[1:35:28] done with this message. I'm done with
[1:35:30] it. No, they start off, they start,
[1:35:33] well, I have a problem with that. See,
[1:35:35] and then I have a problem with that.
[1:35:37] Then I have a problem with something
[1:35:38] else. And then that turns into unbelief.
[1:35:41] And once they find, and I've had them
[1:35:43] I've had them write up into my office
[1:35:44] and said, "I can't believe in the cloud
[1:35:47] anymore." I said, "Well, I don't preach
[1:35:48] a cloud. I preach Christ."
[1:35:50] &gt;&gt; They said, "Well," he said, "I have I
[1:35:53] have evidence that that picture of the
[1:35:55] cloud, they destroyed a missile over uh
[1:35:58] Edwards Air Force Base, I think, in
[1:36:00] Southern California. They destroyed a
[1:36:02] missile and the prevailing winds blew
[1:36:05] that cloud over Arizona." And that's and
[1:36:08] that was his cloud theory. I said,
[1:36:09] 'Well, I said, uh, uh, Elijah, Elijah,
[1:36:14] they they said sent his servant out and
[1:36:17] said, ask him what he sees. He said, he
[1:36:20] sees a little cloud.
[1:36:22] He
[1:36:22] &gt;&gt; sees a little cloud rising up from the
[1:36:25] ground. I said, what was it? Was it
[1:36:26] mist?
[1:36:28] Was it a day that there was mist on the
[1:36:30] what? What? What caused that? I said, I
[1:36:32] don't care. He said, then he wanted to
[1:36:34] know what's the shape of it. It's the
[1:36:36] shape of a man's hand. Yeah.
[1:36:38] &gt;&gt; I said, "This cloud, I don't care what
[1:36:40] caused it.
[1:36:42] &gt;&gt; You You have your own theories. I have
[1:36:44] mine." But what was the shape of it?
[1:36:51] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:36:52] &gt;&gt; And nobody had to nobody had to
[1:36:55] indoctrinate me. Brother Brandham took
[1:36:57] it up in the in the service and he had
[1:36:59] the picture of it. He said, "How many
[1:37:01] have seen this?" Well, all kinds of
[1:37:03] people have seen it at Life magazine. He
[1:37:04] said, "They got it the right the wrong
[1:37:06] direction. It needs to be this way. And
[1:37:09] soon as he turned it, the whole the
[1:37:11] whole congregation, I was sitting there
[1:37:12] as well. I gasped.
[1:37:15] &gt;&gt; Oh, it's Jesus.
[1:37:17] &gt;&gt; I took the picture home. Just some
[1:37:20] little playmates of my daughters in the
[1:37:22] in the townhouse complex and one come
[1:37:25] running in. I said, "Who's this?" She
[1:37:27] said, "It's Jesus." I said, "Even a
[1:37:29] child.
[1:37:31] &gt;&gt; Even a child knows it.
[1:37:33] &gt;&gt; We don't care what caused it. God
[1:37:35] brought it in.
[1:37:37] Hallelujah. And I would say if it was a
[1:37:40] rocket, that would be to me more
[1:37:42] glorious. God took a human
[1:37:44] instrumentality and he let he let the
[1:37:47] human mind construct something and put
[1:37:49] it right into his own his own his own
[1:37:52] description, his own faith. But it
[1:37:54] wasn't that because it was seven angels
[1:37:57] &gt;&gt; and it came from the eternities
[1:38:00] &gt;&gt; in a split.
[1:38:01] &gt;&gt; Dust thou believe?
[1:38:04] &gt;&gt; I do believe. Hallelujah. They came from
[1:38:07] the eternities in a split with a message
[1:38:11] that you need to hear.
[1:38:13] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:38:14] &gt;&gt; They came with the message of the tree
[1:38:16] of life.
[1:38:19] &gt;&gt; Friends, I'm getting ahead of myself,
[1:38:21] but we got the tree of life. You got the
[1:38:22] tree of life back again. Brother
[1:38:24] Brandham said, "It's not back on Adam
[1:38:26] and Eve anymore. It's on your shoulders.
[1:38:29] &gt;&gt; They had a tree of life. You have the
[1:38:31] tree of life.
[1:38:33] [Applause]
[1:38:41] He said, "As the seed of the woman was
[1:38:43] literally God reproducing himself in
[1:38:47] human flesh, the seed of the woman." He
[1:38:50] even spoke it to the serpent. He said,
[1:38:53] "Her seed already prophesying of
[1:38:57] himself,
[1:38:58] her seed." Because he would become that
[1:39:01] seed. Amen.
[1:39:02] &gt;&gt; Her seed will bruise your head.
[1:39:05] &gt;&gt; He was announcing, "Serpent, I'm going
[1:39:07] to crush your head." And you look at the
[1:39:10] word is crush. Bruised is crushed. I
[1:39:13] will crush your head.
[1:39:15] &gt;&gt; I will crush the mind that this ever
[1:39:17] came from. I will crush this mind of
[1:39:19] unbelief.
[1:39:22] &gt;&gt; Glory to God.
[1:39:25] &gt;&gt; I'll do away with it.
[1:39:28] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Aren't you glad he did away
[1:39:30] with it in your case? Amen.
[1:39:31] &gt;&gt; He made you a believer.
[1:39:35] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[1:39:38] &gt;&gt; And he said, "So the seed, so the seed
[1:39:41] of the serpent is the literal way that
[1:39:44] Satan found his found he was able to
[1:39:48] open the door to himself into the human
[1:39:51] race." And that's as close as I can get
[1:39:53] it. That's how he found his way.
[1:39:57] A literal way. literal way that Satan
[1:40:01] found he was able to open the door to
[1:40:03] himself into the human race. And thus
[1:40:07] the world that you rub shoulders with
[1:40:09] every day is possessed with a nature,
[1:40:13] &gt;&gt; this beast nature.
[1:40:17] &gt;&gt; We live in a very unclean world,
[1:40:19] friends. And that world may be Satan
[1:40:22] being as cunning as he is, he doesn't
[1:40:24] show you his brazen or his uh
[1:40:28] unvarnished self,
[1:40:30] &gt;&gt; but he polishes it all up so it will
[1:40:32] look attractive to you, so it'll look
[1:40:35] enticing to you. But once he gets a hold
[1:40:37] of a life where it goes to,
[1:40:40] &gt;&gt; it's a it it is uh
[1:40:44] &gt;&gt; it's a real shame.
[1:40:48] Young people, I speak to you in the name
[1:40:51] of the Lord. Don't ever
[1:40:54] let yourself to start to becoming
[1:40:56] conformed.
[1:40:58] I got to conform.
[1:41:00] I got to talk like my peers. I have to
[1:41:03] talk like my schoolmates. I have to
[1:41:06] dress like them. They do crazy things. I
[1:41:08] kind of have to do crazy things. Maybe
[1:41:10] not as crazy as them, but I'm I'm I'm
[1:41:13] conforming. I'm attracted to it. I'm
[1:41:16] changing.
[1:41:18] My language is changing. How I do
[1:41:20] things, how I think is changing. Don't
[1:41:22] ever get caught in that trap.
[1:41:24] &gt;&gt; That goes good for anybody.
[1:41:28] &gt;&gt; He found his way into the human race. He
[1:41:32] said it was impossible for Satan, for he
[1:41:35] is only a created spirit being. It was
[1:41:39] impossible for Satan to reproduce
[1:41:41] himself in the manner which God
[1:41:44] reproduced himself. He couldn't
[1:41:47] reproduce himself. So the Genesis
[1:41:50] account tells how he produced his seed
[1:41:53] and injected or injected introduced or
[1:41:56] injected himself into the human race.
[1:42:00] &gt;&gt; Now this has always been a mystery to
[1:42:01] me, but this clears it up. Also recall
[1:42:05] that Satan is called the serpent. It is
[1:42:09] his seed or injection into the human
[1:42:12] race that we are speaking of.
[1:42:18] &gt;&gt; Are you following me?
[1:42:24] &gt;&gt; And then brother Brandham goes on in the
[1:42:25] Ephesian church age and he says, "Let me
[1:42:28] try to crystallize your thinking."
[1:42:32] He wants to crystallize our thinking
[1:42:37] &gt;&gt; on this subject so you can see the
[1:42:40] necessity of our going into the serpent
[1:42:43] seed doctrine as I have. He said we
[1:42:45] start with the fact that there were two
[1:42:48] trees. Now he's going back. We start
[1:42:51] with the fact that there were two trees
[1:42:53] in the midst of the garden. The tree of
[1:42:55] life was Jesus.
[1:42:57] &gt;&gt; Amen. And the other tree was definitely
[1:43:00] is definitely Satan because of what came
[1:43:04] forth of the fruit of that tree. And I
[1:43:07] want to now move towards that.
[1:43:13] &gt;&gt; Say some things in a few moments that
[1:43:15] might be a little bit startling.
[1:43:18] Now then he said we know that both of
[1:43:20] these trees had a relationship to man.
[1:43:25] And if both trees are still here, they
[1:43:27] have a relationship to man
[1:43:30] &gt;&gt; or they would never have been placed
[1:43:32] there.
[1:43:33] They must they must have had a part in
[1:43:36] the sovereign plan and purpose of God
[1:43:41] in their relationship to mankind
[1:43:44] and to himself or we would never impute
[1:43:48] omniscience unto God.
[1:43:51] He said, "Now the word most definitely
[1:43:53] sets forth that from before the
[1:43:56] foundation of the earth, the purpose of
[1:43:58] God was to share his eternal life with
[1:44:02] man."
[1:44:03] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:44:03] &gt;&gt; Now, both trees are here.
[1:44:08] &gt;&gt; And their branches are still
[1:44:10] intertwined.
[1:44:11] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:44:12] &gt;&gt; Very much so.
[1:44:14] &gt;&gt; And they spread out their branches over
[1:44:16] the entire earth, this globe.
[1:44:19] They've the branch is spread out over
[1:44:22] Bellingham and Seattle, London,
[1:44:25] Vancouver, Surrey,
[1:44:29] over the entire earth over the country
[1:44:31] or state you move from. The branches are
[1:44:34] there
[1:44:36] and the people are picking the fruit.
[1:44:41] They're enjoying
[1:44:44] maybe the fruit of science.
[1:44:48] the fruit of politics,
[1:44:52] the fruit of education, and it has a
[1:44:55] fruit. I'm standing here today as a
[1:44:58] witness to tell you I have seen people
[1:45:00] sucked away into a pit of despair by
[1:45:04] eating the fruit of education.
[1:45:07] &gt;&gt; I've seen other people eat from the
[1:45:09] fruit of education and use it because
[1:45:11] they kept it controlled by the life from
[1:45:14] the tree of life.
[1:45:17] And that's the only success.
[1:45:19] &gt;&gt; Otherwise, it will swallow you up.
[1:45:24] &gt;&gt; You might as well say, "Amen. I know
[1:45:26] that it's true."
[1:45:30] &gt;&gt; I know that is true.
[1:45:35] &gt;&gt; I'm speaking about people that sat in
[1:45:37] the congregation,
[1:45:39] a congregation of the believers.
[1:45:42] And that and and that spirit that was in
[1:45:46] that
[1:45:48] segment or that part of this world, this
[1:45:52] world be not conformed to this world.
[1:45:56] And they began just little by little
[1:45:58] becoming conformed and conformed. And
[1:46:00] they became enamored. They were told how
[1:46:04] smart they are.
[1:46:06] Oh,
[1:46:11] &gt;&gt; you have to forgive me and yet don't
[1:46:13] forgive me cuz I just talk in private.
[1:46:16] My wife was saying and referring to
[1:46:18] something and saying, "Oh, they are so
[1:46:21] smart and so intelligent." I said, "No,
[1:46:23] they're stupid.
[1:46:25] They're not smart at all. They're
[1:46:26] actually stupid. They can't figure out
[1:46:28] even how to conduct their own lives. How
[1:46:31] can I be so smart and yet be empty and
[1:46:35] be dissatisfied in all of this?
[1:46:42] &gt;&gt; Hey, listen. I'm talking from
[1:46:43] experience.
[1:46:46] &gt;&gt; I'm a school dropout.
[1:46:48] &gt;&gt; All right.
[1:46:50] &gt;&gt; I'm not lifting that up. I don't want
[1:46:52] anybody to be school dropout. We got We
[1:46:54] got kids out of If they drop out of this
[1:46:56] school here, we're going to do damage to
[1:46:58] you.
[1:47:02] But we were we were having conducting a
[1:47:04] big sale one time and and one of the men
[1:47:07] was
[1:47:09] and you know one of the people members
[1:47:11] of the company he says see that fellow
[1:47:14] down there I said yeah you know what he
[1:47:16] was doing he was sweeping the floor he's
[1:47:19] sweeping the sales floor
[1:47:22] he said he he is so advanced in UBC he's
[1:47:27] got all kinds of education
[1:47:29] and and he's he doesn't know exactly
[1:47:32] what he wants to be. He's permanent
[1:47:34] school. He's a permanent student. He
[1:47:37] just you ever don't be so silent now.
[1:47:40] I'm telling you my experience.
[1:47:43] And there he was.
[1:47:45] He was intelligent. Oh, did he ever have
[1:47:47] it up here? But when it translated, it
[1:47:50] went down to his hands. It became a
[1:47:52] broom hands on a broom
[1:47:56] because he hadn't figured out where he
[1:47:57] was going to be.
[1:48:00] &gt;&gt; Anybody who's really smart ought to know
[1:48:02] at least where they're going
[1:48:03] &gt;&gt; and what they're going to do and what
[1:48:05] they want to be
[1:48:06] &gt;&gt; anyhow.
[1:48:11] &gt;&gt; I said that cuz I needed to say it.
[1:48:15] &gt;&gt; I'm I'm totally exasperated.
[1:48:18] Look at Look at the laws. some of the
[1:48:21] laws that control your life,
[1:48:23] &gt;&gt; control how you bank, control the
[1:48:26] financing. How can such brilliant people
[1:48:29] not foresee the meltdown we've just had?
[1:48:32] How can a brilliant mind not realize
[1:48:35] that a man who gets a hundred million
[1:48:39] dollars as a bonus cuz he's so smart? He
[1:48:42] runs a financial institution and robs
[1:48:45] the people.
[1:48:48] Who needs $100 million for a bonus?
[1:48:54] &gt;&gt; You people buy gas?
[1:48:56] &gt;&gt; You gas your cars up. Do you think they
[1:48:59] need to charge what they're charging?
[1:49:01] &gt;&gt; They don't need to charge it. It's smart
[1:49:04] people that are stealing it.
[1:49:07] &gt;&gt; I mean, people might say, "Well, that's
[1:49:09] not even the gospel." Absolutely, it's
[1:49:10] the gospel. But the prophet of God said,
[1:49:13] "These things are of the devil.
[1:49:16] They came from the But you have to pay
[1:49:18] it. That's right. And you drive a car.
[1:49:20] That's good. It came from the tree of
[1:49:22] knowledge. But we use it for the kingdom
[1:49:24] of God. You drive to church with it. A
[1:49:27] lot of other people don't. You You
[1:49:29] control it.
[1:49:31] &gt;&gt; What you're going to do with it.
[1:49:33] &gt;&gt; You have to control this life.
[1:49:35] &gt;&gt; Everything from the tree of life
[1:49:37] controls what come from the tree of
[1:49:39] knowledge.
[1:49:43] I'm going to preach it till I feel I'm
[1:49:44] done.
[1:49:46] [Applause]
[1:49:54] &gt;&gt; Says the other tree is Satan because of
[1:49:56] what came forth of the fruit of that
[1:49:59] tree.
[1:50:01] Now both of these trees had a
[1:50:03] relationship with man and they had a a
[1:50:06] place a part in the sovereign plan of
[1:50:08] God.
[1:50:10] Now he says man could not directly come
[1:50:13] and partake of that tree of life in the
[1:50:16] midst of the garden. That eternal life
[1:50:19] of the tree had to become flesh first.
[1:50:23] &gt;&gt; That's why God drove man out lest he
[1:50:26] take of the fruit of the tree. So he had
[1:50:29] to drive man out. But before God could
[1:50:32] raise and save a sinner, he had to have
[1:50:35] a sinner to raise
[1:50:37] &gt;&gt; and save. Amen.
[1:50:39] &gt;&gt; Oh friends, if you want something deep
[1:50:41] that's deep.
[1:50:43] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:50:44] &gt;&gt; Before he could save a sinner, he had to
[1:50:46] have a sinner
[1:50:48] &gt;&gt; to save.
[1:50:50] &gt;&gt; What kind of God is We're not
[1:50:51] questioning what kind of God. That's
[1:50:52] God.
[1:50:53] &gt;&gt; He can do what he wishes to do. He had
[1:50:56] to have a sinner to save. He wanted to
[1:50:57] show his great his great power to
[1:50:59] forgive and to redeem and take the the
[1:51:02] the the worst of them. Paul said he was
[1:51:05] the chief of sinners. I don't know. But
[1:51:07] he said man had to fall. The fall which
[1:51:10] would be caused by Satan had to have
[1:51:13] flesh to make to make fall. Satan had to
[1:51:16] come through flesh also. But Satan could
[1:51:19] not come through human flesh to make the
[1:51:23] fall as would Christ come in human flesh
[1:51:25] to restore the fallen.
[1:51:30] &gt;&gt; This doesn't really sound like someone
[1:51:31] from a seventh grade education in
[1:51:33] Kentucky, does it?
[1:51:38] I
[1:51:38] &gt;&gt; tell you what, friends, this came from
[1:51:40] higher than anything here on this
[1:51:42] planet.
[1:51:43] &gt;&gt; It came from the the throne of God.
[1:51:49] &gt;&gt; Do you agree?
[1:51:53] He says, "But there was an animal, a
[1:51:55] serpent
[1:51:57] so close to man that Satan could get to
[1:51:59] that beast and through that beast he
[1:52:03] could get to human flesh and cause the
[1:52:06] fall and inject himself." This is why
[1:52:09] I'm belaboring this point to because it
[1:52:11] it's it's almost mysterious. and inject
[1:52:14] himself thereby into the human race even
[1:52:18] as Jesus would come uh as Jesus would
[1:52:21] one day come and inject himself into the
[1:52:25] human race into human bodies even to the
[1:52:28] extent of a resurrection wherein we
[1:52:30] would have bodies like unto his glorious
[1:52:33] body. So when he injected his seed the
[1:52:37] soul into the believer there's a
[1:52:39] resurrection in you. Amen.
[1:52:44] &gt;&gt; There's a resurrection in you. You have
[1:52:46] it right now. If you get if you run out
[1:52:48] on the street and get killed today,
[1:52:50] don't worry. There's a resurrection in
[1:52:52] you.
[1:52:53] &gt;&gt; And you that are believers, are you
[1:52:55] believers in this message? There's a
[1:52:56] rapture in you. It's already in you.
[1:53:00] &gt;&gt; That seed that God spoke, it has the
[1:53:03] power of rapture. Has the power of
[1:53:05] resurrection. It's greater than the
[1:53:07] atoms that make up your body.
[1:53:10] It's the word of God.
[1:53:15] &gt;&gt; He said, "Let there be." I don't know
[1:53:17] what the sound was. I don't know exactly
[1:53:19] what the verbiage was. And it's
[1:53:21] irrelevant to me. It's immaterial to us
[1:53:24] because we know that God has spoken it.
[1:53:26] He put it in his word in written form so
[1:53:30] we wouldn't have to mistake what he
[1:53:32] meant.
[1:53:36] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:53:37] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:53:40] And so now having said that, I'll just
[1:53:43] recquote this please.
[1:53:46] But there was an animal, the serpent,
[1:53:49] because I learned even in school that we
[1:53:51] are of the mammal.
[1:53:55] Biology students, is that right?
[1:54:00] Wouldn't make any difference whether it
[1:54:01] says right or not. He said it
[1:54:05] &gt;&gt; so close to man that Satan could get to
[1:54:07] that beast and through that beast he
[1:54:11] could get to the human flesh. That's
[1:54:13] what he wanted to when he said I will
[1:54:16] ascend
[1:54:18] &gt;&gt; to the sides of the north
[1:54:20] &gt;&gt; to the congregation to the sides of the
[1:54:22] north. And if you read it and take it
[1:54:24] down and break it down into the words
[1:54:26] that is in the Hebrew language, it is
[1:54:29] the sides of the north as a place of
[1:54:31] procreation.
[1:54:34] &gt;&gt; I will ascend. I will go to that place.
[1:54:38] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:54:39] &gt;&gt; That's what was in his mind. And that's
[1:54:41] where he had to go because he wanted to
[1:54:44] inject himself into the human race
[1:54:47] because he wanted to be where God,
[1:54:49] listen, he wanted to be where God wants
[1:54:51] to be. God wants to rule and reign in
[1:54:55] your life.
[1:54:56] &gt;&gt; And that is why Satan desired it in the
[1:54:59] first place. I want to be I want to be
[1:55:01] lifted up. I want to be worshiped. And
[1:55:03] he becomes the beast in the book of
[1:55:05] Revelation. And all whose names are not
[1:55:07] found in the book of life, they worship
[1:55:10] the beast.
[1:55:13] &gt;&gt; Listen to me, my brother, my sister. the
[1:55:16] seed that God put in you, you want to
[1:55:18] thank God for it because it's on the
[1:55:20] basis of that seed that you will not be
[1:55:22] found worshiping him.
[1:55:25] &gt;&gt; There's something in you that resists
[1:55:26] that.
[1:55:28] &gt;&gt; And it's the seed in you. It's not your
[1:55:30] mind. You're not figuring out what's
[1:55:32] good, what's right, what's what's
[1:55:34] according to the word. We're not. It's
[1:55:35] your soul
[1:55:37] &gt;&gt; and it witnesses to you. That's not
[1:55:39] right.
[1:55:41] &gt;&gt; Listen to that soul.
[1:55:43] &gt;&gt; Listen to that voice. Amen.
[1:55:49] &gt;&gt; So the tree of knowledge of good and
[1:55:50] evil has spread its b branches over all
[1:55:54] the earth. Eve wanted wisdom and
[1:55:57] believed that by partaking of this tree,
[1:56:00] she would become wise as gods. And
[1:56:03] here's where I want to come to yet. I
[1:56:05] still have just a little ways to go.
[1:56:07] And when the woman saw
[1:56:12] that the tree was good for food and that
[1:56:14] it was pleasant to the eyes and a tree
[1:56:18] to be desired to make one wise,
[1:56:22] she took the fruit. So when she came to
[1:56:25] that place and she had reasoned it out,
[1:56:28] this is pleasant.
[1:56:30] This is good for food.
[1:56:35] And when she saw when she looked upon it
[1:56:39] and this is where I want to come to and
[1:56:41] I might not get there completely so I'll
[1:56:43] just say the phrase
[1:56:48] we
[1:56:52] as children of God
[1:56:54] do not want to be and must not look to
[1:57:00] the tree of knowledge for the answers
[1:57:04] to our spirit. spiritual dilemma, our
[1:57:06] spiritual question or what we think we
[1:57:08] need to know. We cannot be looking to
[1:57:10] the tree of knowledge for our answers in
[1:57:13] life.
[1:57:17] &gt;&gt; I want you to memorize that. I must not
[1:57:21] look to the tree of knowledge for the
[1:57:23] answers to my life.
[1:57:28] &gt;&gt; The tree of knowledge has lots of
[1:57:29] answers. It'll it is there. The
[1:57:32] enticement was this will make you wise.
[1:57:34] This will even make you spiritual.
[1:57:36] You'll be like gods and you know the
[1:57:39] difference between good and evil.
[1:57:41] &gt;&gt; And all of that was very attractive to
[1:57:43] her.
[1:57:46] The fruits from the and they and and
[1:57:50] don't forget
[1:57:52] the branches are intertwined.
[1:57:56] So when you look up,
[1:57:58] you'll have to have something else
[1:58:01] &gt;&gt; that will tell you
[1:58:03] that's the tree of knowledge of good and
[1:58:06] evil.
[1:58:07] &gt;&gt; But this branch over here is the tree of
[1:58:09] life.
[1:58:13] &gt;&gt; You'll have to have a special
[1:58:15] &gt;&gt; inner
[1:58:17] &gt;&gt; Holy Ghost
[1:58:19] &gt;&gt; wisdom.
[1:58:24] Amen.
[1:58:30] I can say a lot of things right now. I'm
[1:58:32] just holding back a little bit. And when
[1:58:35] she saw,
[1:58:37] now he says, the prophet says the devil
[1:58:40] always works in beauty.
[1:58:44] &gt;&gt; So the things that come from the tree of
[1:58:46] knowledge look nice.
[1:58:50] &gt;&gt; They are attractive.
[1:58:53] I'm not speaking down just physical the
[1:58:56] physical beauty or the physical
[1:58:59] individual
[1:59:01] but he he works in beauty
[1:59:04] and you that God has you that are in the
[1:59:08] beauty of your youth don't become caught
[1:59:12] away with that
[1:59:14] you know you're strong you're healthy
[1:59:16] you're young you got a good physique and
[1:59:18] the girls you know you got that
[1:59:20] brightness and that that uh shining eyes
[1:59:25] and and all the things. And then and
[1:59:27] then there are things and you go through
[1:59:29] the department store and
[1:59:34] look at something that can maybe add to
[1:59:37] that beauty
[1:59:40] and kind of there's a desire say you
[1:59:42] know that might be nice if I you know
[1:59:46] you move along through hey why do you
[1:59:48] think you go in these department stores
[1:59:50] right here the fir the first thing is
[1:59:52] all the all the beauty items
[1:59:56] You think some Holy Ghost preacher
[1:59:58] designed that? No. They didn't call a
[2:00:00] Holy Ghost preacher in there and say,
[2:00:02] "What should we put right at the
[2:00:03] entrance to the shopping center?" No,
[2:00:05] they put all the things there that want
[2:00:07] to, you know, that will appeal to you.
[2:00:10] &gt;&gt; And you know what? They don't put the
[2:00:12] men's work boots out there.
[2:00:15] Even though the man has to go out and
[2:00:16] wake up, make a living, but they don't
[2:00:18] put the man's work boots out there.
[2:00:19] They're not Hey, fellas, they're not
[2:00:21] interested in us.
[2:00:23] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:00:24] Oh, you might find some clone that
[2:00:28] smells nice
[2:00:29] &gt;&gt; somewhere buried amongst all that
[2:00:31] perfume.
[2:00:35] How can you say that, brother? Cuz I've
[2:00:37] been there
[2:00:38] &gt;&gt; and have to go like almost hat in hand.
[2:00:41] Have you got any after shave? Oh, you
[2:00:44] mean bomb? No, not bomb. After shave.
[2:00:47] Oh, I don't know if we got any. dig
[2:00:49] around all this perfume and all these
[2:00:51] things and you got strips that you can
[2:00:53] smell it.
[2:00:58] Who who who you putting it on for?
[2:01:03] &gt;&gt; I say to my wife, "Make sure you're
[2:01:05] putting that on for me."
[2:01:09] So you you've smelled a few and they
[2:01:10] said, "Well, here, just take a new one."
[2:01:16] What are we doing, friends? It's right
[2:01:18] on the door. I'm telling you, you know
[2:01:19] what?
[2:01:21] You know what? We become so conformed to
[2:01:23] it, we don't even think twice. I just go
[2:01:26] barging right through and here they're
[2:01:27] flowering all the girls up and with the
[2:01:29] thing on their face and you know all the
[2:01:31] brushes and everything else and this
[2:01:33] color and that color and this and and
[2:01:35] they're all in nice smoks like they know
[2:01:37] something and
[2:01:40] they're buticians
[2:01:43] and some other kind of
[2:01:46] you know what they're out for? They're
[2:01:48] out for this.
[2:01:52] All right.
[2:01:55] &gt;&gt; Forgive me. You didn't expect this kind
[2:01:57] of a service. Neither did I. But anyway,
[2:01:59] that that's the world.
[2:02:01] &gt;&gt; That's the world. And they're they're
[2:02:03] out there to get you to conform to it.
[2:02:05] &gt;&gt; Say, "Well, well, I'll you know, and
[2:02:07] once they hook you on one, then you go
[2:02:09] to another one anyway."
[2:02:12] &gt;&gt; All right.
[2:02:14] So
[2:02:17] he says in the Thotyron church age and
[2:02:19] he says I'll I'll I will put no other
[2:02:22] burden on you. The word for burden is
[2:02:25] weight or pressure. The pressures the
[2:02:28] pressure of the dark ages was either
[2:02:30] bend or be broken. Bow or die. It was
[2:02:34] the Inquisition. And that was, you know,
[2:02:37] maybe army or soldiers or whatever more
[2:02:39] could come in here from the government
[2:02:41] and say, "You're going to believe this.
[2:02:43] If you want to believe this, you can
[2:02:44] recamp till you go out the doors. Once
[2:02:46] you go out the doors, we're going to
[2:02:48] we're going to behead you or we're going
[2:02:51] to kill you or we're going to put you to
[2:02:53] the stake." Well,
[2:02:56] I'm not going to lay any heavy on you,
[2:02:58] but that was the Inquisition.
[2:03:01] &gt;&gt; And so, some wouldn't bend, they
[2:03:03] wouldn't bow, they wouldn't burn. and
[2:03:04] many others did bend and uh
[2:03:10] uh it was the power of the empire
[2:03:12] backing up satanic worship to be
[2:03:15] organized or pay with your life. Each
[2:03:18] age had its pressure. For example, the
[2:03:21] great burden of this age is the pressure
[2:03:25] of riches of soft living and nervous
[2:03:29] tensions. You might not have pressure of
[2:03:32] riches on you. You might not even have
[2:03:35] the pressure of soft living. However, I
[2:03:36] think most of us do. You know, we're out
[2:03:39] we're not out there to make life more
[2:03:42] grueling,
[2:03:43] to make it more difficult.
[2:03:46] We want to make it easier. Listen,
[2:03:49] friends, my father was a carpenter. I'm,
[2:03:52] you know, I'm I'm speaking now from what
[2:03:54] I know. You have to forgive me. I kind
[2:03:57] of got tainted with brother Kyle on
[2:03:59] Wednesday night. He just talked from his
[2:04:01] personal experience. Uh,
[2:04:04] I I I I knew a little bit about
[2:04:06] carpenter work. I go over here to help
[2:04:08] brother Kim and his men and they got
[2:04:11] stuff I've never seen in my life. Said,
[2:04:15] "We have to, you know, we have to go in
[2:04:16] and we have to cut around that." Oh, no,
[2:04:18] don't use that. He said, "We we got a we
[2:04:20] got a saw that'll do that, man." And and
[2:04:24] the the they they do things with stuff
[2:04:26] I've never seen. Said, "Can that all
[2:04:29] happen?" Well, yeah. We just pulled that
[2:04:32] saw right off the tree of knowledge.
[2:04:34] &gt;&gt; Well, I'm glad that it's building a
[2:04:36] school
[2:04:37] &gt;&gt; for you kids.
[2:04:45] &gt;&gt; But it's a pressure of easy living. You
[2:04:48] know, we just want it easier and easier
[2:04:50] and easier and that's that's fine. I
[2:04:53] don't want to go back to the scrub
[2:04:54] board. I don't want to see my wife doing
[2:04:56] this. I don't want to see the old sewing
[2:04:59] washing machine or sewing machine. Yes,
[2:05:01] we do. But not washing machine.
[2:05:04] And we we don't we don't want to go
[2:05:07] backwards,
[2:05:08] &gt;&gt; but we better control our forward
[2:05:10] movement.
[2:05:17] &gt;&gt; And nervous tensions. Well, there's no
[2:05:19] use saying anything about that because
[2:05:21] none of us have that,
[2:05:24] &gt;&gt; do we?
[2:05:27] Some of you that have the simplest life.
[2:05:29] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[2:05:30] &gt;&gt; It should be so simple. It should be so
[2:05:32] easy.
[2:05:35] &gt;&gt; And you got all kinds. How about you
[2:05:37] young couples that just got married or
[2:05:38] you that are going to get married or you
[2:05:40] that have been married for a little
[2:05:41] while? How about you that got children?
[2:05:43] You have no tensions.
[2:05:45] You're smiling, James. You're honest.
[2:05:49] How about the rest of you folks? No
[2:05:52] nervous tensions. Well, I and my wife,
[2:05:54] we have no we have no tension because
[2:05:56] we're just coasting along now.
[2:06:02] You want to come to my house on a Sunday
[2:06:04] morning?
[2:06:07] Trying to get the printer going and
[2:06:09] trying to do this and trying to do that.
[2:06:10] Why? So I can get here and speak. And I
[2:06:13] don't want to be, you know, I don't want
[2:06:16] to be searching and looking for things.
[2:06:17] I want to be able to have had spent I
[2:06:20] don't know what this means to you, but
[2:06:21] I've spent two weeks
[2:06:23] just in this message because the one
[2:06:27] thought I have and I'm going to be
[2:06:29] concluding soon is I I just came to the
[2:06:32] conclusion
[2:06:35] we are so inclined and so pressured to
[2:06:39] look
[2:06:41] soon as something happens our life we
[2:06:43] must not look to the tree of knowledge
[2:06:47] &gt;&gt; for the immediate answer.
[2:06:49] &gt;&gt; I believe we should look to the tree of
[2:06:51] life. Amen.
[2:06:54] &gt;&gt; Okay, I'm going to carry on just a
[2:06:55] little bit more, please, for a few
[2:06:57] minutes.
[2:06:59] He said, "Oh, if we are the sons and
[2:07:02] daughters of the king, the king of
[2:07:05] kings, let's conduct our character as
[2:07:09] Christians.
[2:07:10] We are aliens. We're pilgrims and we're
[2:07:14] strangers here. This is not our world.
[2:07:17] We're seeking a kingdom to come that is
[2:07:20] to come. This is not our home. Though we
[2:07:23] be tossed about and made fun of by the
[2:07:26] world and called this and that and the
[2:07:29] other and old fashioned and all like
[2:07:31] that, what do we care? You don't want to
[2:07:35] be partnering yourself with some kind of
[2:07:39] a movie star or some television star or
[2:07:43] something. You're a daughter of God. You
[2:07:45] notice what he said? He said uh you know
[2:07:48] even a pastor's wife or or someone else
[2:07:51] within the church or you you see he
[2:07:54] talks about a movie star that is why God
[2:07:57] so hates that whole system called
[2:08:02] Hollywood because it is polluted and he
[2:08:06] said we are transporting all the
[2:08:08] iniquity and the evil and the filth to
[2:08:11] Paris where it used to come from. Listen
[2:08:14] friends, it comes right from our own
[2:08:17] country. They call Vancouver Hollywood
[2:08:19] North. I don't think that's anything to
[2:08:21] boast about. I think that's a disgrace.
[2:08:23] That's why we got so much perversion
[2:08:25] around. Get all this kind of talented uh
[2:08:28] artists and people and so on. And you
[2:08:31] get all this perversion that's around.
[2:08:33] It's a great pressure.
[2:08:36] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:08:40] &gt;&gt; It's a great pressure.
[2:08:49] You're a daughter of God. You're a son
[2:08:51] of God. Let's act like God. We are the
[2:08:55] children of God. We know that we're sons
[2:08:57] and daughters of the king. Let our own
[2:09:00] Let our own character, let our character
[2:09:03] reflect his presence, no matter how
[2:09:06] rough it gets.
[2:09:09] &gt;&gt; I tell you, this is looking for rugged
[2:09:10] men and women.
[2:09:11] &gt;&gt; Amen. Let's let our character reflect
[2:09:15] his presence. Now, in the in the Old
[2:09:18] Testament, I'm just going to drop this
[2:09:19] in quickly. In the Old Testament, and
[2:09:22] you've probably read it, they had what
[2:09:24] was called the frontlets between the
[2:09:26] eyes, and that was the little square
[2:09:29] boxes. How many have seen that? Yeah,
[2:09:31] many of you. Okay. They have the little
[2:09:33] square boxes and they also put one on
[2:09:35] the arm. It is because in there the real
[2:09:38] strict orthodox there's a certain
[2:09:40] variety of them sect of them that have
[2:09:43] the actually the word of the law written
[2:09:46] uh written in that on a little wee tiny
[2:09:48] scroll and it's placed in there because
[2:09:51] they're giving testimony that they're
[2:09:53] keeping the word before them all the
[2:09:55] time. And that was the purpose of it to
[2:09:58] keep keep the word before. And that's
[2:10:01] why it means only the frontlets. And the
[2:10:04] word for frontlets means only that one
[2:10:06] should always be preoccupied with the
[2:10:09] words. This is from the from the some of
[2:10:11] the uh Hebrews, the Jews. It means only
[2:10:14] that one should be preoccupied with the
[2:10:17] words of the Torah as if they were in
[2:10:20] front of one's eyes all the time. You
[2:10:22] see, and that's why Apostle Paul said,
[2:10:25] "While we look not at the things which
[2:10:27] are seen,
[2:10:28] &gt;&gt; the things which are seen are passing,
[2:10:31] but at the things which are not seen,
[2:10:34] for the things which are seen are
[2:10:36] temporal."
[2:10:37] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:10:37] &gt;&gt; But the things which are not seen are
[2:10:40] eternal.
[2:10:40] &gt;&gt; The things which are seen, friends, now
[2:10:43] we may take u we we'll we'll strip the
[2:10:46] land. We'll strip the soil. We'll cut
[2:10:47] down the trees, put it through a mill
[2:10:49] and all the rest of it, and we reshape
[2:10:52] it from from a big tree to a piece of
[2:10:56] lumber and we build a house out of it.
[2:10:58] We have to do that. We have pieces of
[2:11:00] iron come out of the and different
[2:11:02] metals and plastics and so on come out
[2:11:03] and we have a car we drive. We're we're
[2:11:06] glad that we have that and we need that.
[2:11:08] But remember remember this messenger
[2:11:12] said that that civilization will have
[2:11:15] none of these things
[2:11:18] &gt;&gt; and that soul within you and me cries
[2:11:22] out for that civilization.
[2:11:25] I don't know what it's going to be like,
[2:11:27] but my soul yearns for it because this
[2:11:30] one I see nothing but death and trouble
[2:11:33] and and and sin and uncleanness. And our
[2:11:37] soul cries and and people will wait,
[2:11:40] they wait for death to be released from
[2:11:42] it.
[2:11:44] &gt;&gt; But there's a group of people, we
[2:11:46] shouldn't just look to death to be
[2:11:48] released from it. We look to life to be
[2:11:50] released from it. The life that's in me
[2:11:52] says we are here to be changed. Say, "Oh
[2:11:55] God, bring that rapture change. Oh God,
[2:11:59] what should we always look? That should
[2:12:01] be the prize of the high calling in
[2:12:03] Christ Jesus." We constantly never get
[2:12:05] tired of looking for that.
[2:12:09] &gt;&gt; Keep that in front of you all the time.
[2:12:11] Amen.
[2:12:24] &gt;&gt; Brother Bannon was talking and speaking
[2:12:26] about Luke
[2:12:28] and he was speaking about Job
[2:12:31] and he said the first he's called a
[2:12:34] redeemer talking about Job's phrase
[2:12:38] and next he's God.
[2:12:41] I know my redeemer liveth. Notice now,
[2:12:46] please notice. I know my redeemer
[2:12:49] liveth. And the last days he'll stand on
[2:12:52] the earth.
[2:12:54] &gt;&gt; And though the skin worms destroys this
[2:12:57] body, yet in my flesh shall he see God.
[2:13:01] Brother Brham is saying to us that the
[2:13:04] revelation is is a deepening revelation.
[2:13:08] It's an increasing revelation. First he
[2:13:11] knows it's his redeemer. I know my
[2:13:13] redeemer liveth.
[2:13:16] And he shall stand on the earth and with
[2:13:18] my own eyes I shall see God.
[2:13:21] &gt;&gt; Now
[2:13:24] whom I shall see for myself and my eyes
[2:13:26] shall behold and not another. He said
[2:13:29] when he was dying and his body rotting
[2:13:32] and while he was in the flesh he looked
[2:13:37] he looked till he seen the resurrection.
[2:13:42] &gt;&gt; So he kept looking. Look at I I'm
[2:13:45] appealing now to you that are sitting
[2:13:47] here ones I'm speaking to. If the
[2:13:51] resurrection or if the rapture or the
[2:13:54] change of this body or the or or or the
[2:13:57] promise of God is not a reality to you,
[2:14:00] then you need to take this principle.
[2:14:03] You know, you know what I'm doing today?
[2:14:05] I'm looking hard at the tree of life
[2:14:08] with you and encouraging you to look at
[2:14:11] that tree of life and I'm catching these
[2:14:13] principles. He said that Job looked and
[2:14:16] while he looked he saw he was his
[2:14:18] redeemer and as he kept looking he saw
[2:14:20] that he was his God and as he kept
[2:14:23] looking he saw the resurrection. I would
[2:14:26] say we as a people we need to keep
[2:14:28] looking. You keep looking at that word.
[2:14:30] You keep looking at that we call it a
[2:14:32] message. You keep looking at the promise
[2:14:34] of God that God you just keep looking at
[2:14:37] it. Not just looking at a book but
[2:14:39] looking at
[2:14:42] &gt;&gt; I have I have I have the power of
[2:14:44] transformation here and I just take line
[2:14:48] by line don't change your nature line by
[2:14:53] line
[2:14:54] underline it
[2:15:01] blessed me see if the attributes of God
[2:15:04] speaking forth and it's placed on paper
[2:15:07] the attributes of God speaking forth and
[2:15:10] he placed it on paper because he knew
[2:15:12] that generations would have to read it.
[2:15:14] So we keep looking. Don't look. Don't
[2:15:17] look friends for your satisfaction from
[2:15:20] the tree of knowledge. It's abundant.
[2:15:22] &gt;&gt; It's just hanging with all kinds of
[2:15:24] things. Don't look for the answers to
[2:15:26] this life on the tree of oh if I only
[2:15:29] get that then I'll you know I'll kind of
[2:15:31] be out of the uh I'll be out of the this
[2:15:35] this great burden that I have. No. No.
[2:15:38] Satan in this world has another one
[2:15:40] fixed for you.
[2:15:42] &gt;&gt; We ought to govern our lives entirely by
[2:15:46] the word of God.
[2:15:48] &gt;&gt; We want our excess our success when we
[2:15:50] get done. We want our success to be well
[2:15:53] done. Yeah.
[2:15:55] &gt;&gt; Thou good and faithful servant.
[2:15:57] &gt;&gt; That's what you want to hear. I'm
[2:15:59] telling you, that's what you want to. If
[2:16:01] you don't hear that, we've missed
[2:16:03] everything.
[2:16:04] &gt;&gt; Well done, thou good and faithful
[2:16:06] servant. We don't have to be somebody
[2:16:08] spectacular in the kingdom of God. We
[2:16:11] don't have to be, you know, some vocal
[2:16:13] person. Don't have to be a preacher.
[2:16:16] Don't have to be a singer. Just have to
[2:16:18] be faithful in the calling that God has
[2:16:20] for you. And the best thing that you can
[2:16:22] do is say, "Lord, I'm here for your
[2:16:25] purpose. I'm here to live for you. I'm
[2:16:28] here to do the most menial thing if I
[2:16:30] need to, but I'm here to be faithful to
[2:16:33] the call of God."
[2:16:34] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:16:36] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[2:16:40] &gt;&gt; Now,
[2:16:42] I I need to just put a couple.
[2:16:47] He said,
[2:16:49] because I want to let you know that
[2:16:51] there were some who saw,
[2:16:53] but it didn't do any good.
[2:16:58] &gt;&gt; There's some who see this message and
[2:17:00] they say, "Oh man, anybody can see
[2:17:03] that." I gave the serpent seed to about
[2:17:05] three young men and they were so they
[2:17:08] they they almost were were levitating
[2:17:11] off of my front room floor. He said and
[2:17:14] and one slid off the sofa and slid right
[2:17:16] onto the floor. He was so transfixed.
[2:17:18] And I said, "Well, now uh you know, keep
[2:17:21] this to yourself." Oh, he said, "My
[2:17:23] pastor will see this." I said, "No,
[2:17:25] don't take it there. You just take it
[2:17:27] for yourself." Oh, they were so filled
[2:17:31] they left there and never saw him again.
[2:17:35] Do they see something? Absolutely.
[2:17:38] &gt;&gt; So, Brother Brandham says that what I'm
[2:17:43] trying to say is this, that they see
[2:17:46] clearly
[2:17:47] the clearly a vindicated word like
[2:17:50] Pilate and the rest of them did.
[2:17:53] &gt;&gt; They saw clearly the vindicated word
[2:17:57] like Pilate and the rest of them did and
[2:18:00] like the Roman soldier. But you are
[2:18:03] going to wait too late
[2:18:05] &gt;&gt; to get anything about it. He said he
[2:18:08] should have used the spear the other
[2:18:11] way. The doors will be closed like it
[2:18:15] was in the days of Noah and then it was
[2:18:17] too late. You might wake up some morning
[2:18:19] and say, "I intend to get out of this
[2:18:21] mess." Don't wait too long. You better
[2:18:24] look and live now.
[2:18:26] &gt;&gt; That's what he was saying. Yeah. Amen.
[2:18:29] &gt;&gt; The centurion, the Bible says, "And when
[2:18:31] the centurion and they that were with
[2:18:33] him watching Jesus
[2:18:38] saw the earthquake and those things that
[2:18:41] were done, they feared greatly, saying,
[2:18:45] They feared greatly." When they saw the
[2:18:47] earthquake
[2:18:49] and all the other signs,
[2:18:52] they said, "Surely this was the son of
[2:18:55] God."
[2:18:56] &gt;&gt; Too late. That's right. Amen.
[2:19:02] &gt;&gt; We as a congregation of people,
[2:19:05] one thing for sure,
[2:19:08] we're not to have any excuse for being
[2:19:11] too late.
[2:19:12] &gt;&gt; You say, "Well, what what would I do,
[2:19:14] brother Bisc? What should I do?" I would
[2:19:16] press with everything that I have.
[2:19:19] Listen, I have read and studied this
[2:19:21] message for
[2:19:24] many, many years, probably for close to
[2:19:27] 40 years.
[2:19:29] You know what? One of my greatest
[2:19:30] desires is to immerse myself
[2:19:34] &gt;&gt; further into this word because I know
[2:19:37] it's not just so I get a nugget for this
[2:19:39] time or find a secret for this time. I I
[2:19:42] know that in there is the secret of the
[2:19:45] resurrection. in there. Rapturing faith
[2:19:49] is on the tape. It's in that voice. It's
[2:19:53] actually there. If we knew that your
[2:19:55] rapture, the thing that your soul is
[2:19:57] crying out for, it's literally there.
[2:20:00] &gt;&gt; Shouldn't we find everything? It might
[2:20:02] be that he'd say, "It's not even the
[2:20:04] time. It's maybe not just the time." But
[2:20:06] I would say to you and I, I'm saying it
[2:20:09] to myself. I want to give myself. That
[2:20:12] is one of the great thirsts I have in in
[2:20:14] my soul is just to give myself, immerse
[2:20:17] myself, read it line by line, paragraph
[2:20:20] by paragraph, and and make a note where
[2:20:23] it speaks to me. I urge you to do that.
[2:20:25] I can tell you your life will never be
[2:20:28] the same. And you'll never never regret
[2:20:30] it. You'll never regret it. If people
[2:20:33] say, "Well, I put too much emphasis on
[2:20:35] the message." Let me say to you, I am
[2:20:37] prepared to go to the judgment bar of
[2:20:40] Almighty God and have him tell me, "You
[2:20:42] put too much emphasis on my prophet's
[2:20:45] voice."
[2:20:47] &gt;&gt; I don't think that's ever going to
[2:20:49] happen.
[2:20:49] &gt;&gt; I think that those that have loved it
[2:20:51] and embraced it, he's going to say,
[2:20:54] "Blessed are you. You love my voice.
[2:20:58] &gt;&gt; You love what I said.
[2:21:00] &gt;&gt; You believed it.
[2:21:02] &gt;&gt; Enter on in."
[2:21:04] You know why he's going to say enter in?
[2:21:05] Because he's going to say you're going
[2:21:07] to hear more of it.
[2:21:08] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:21:12] [Applause]
[2:21:15] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[2:21:17] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[2:21:19] &gt;&gt; I called this message today and I'm
[2:21:21] giving the title at the end, Beholding
[2:21:25] the Tree of Life.
[2:21:28] &gt;&gt; Just beholding it.
[2:21:31] &gt;&gt; Just looking and beholding him.
[2:21:36] something that can you know when two
[2:21:39] people love one another
[2:21:41] &gt;&gt; they don't have to say a whole lot of
[2:21:42] things they don't have to do a whole lot
[2:21:43] of things sometime they just look at
[2:21:45] each other
[2:21:47] &gt;&gt; say you just appreciate that person
[2:21:50] appreciate them for what they are you
[2:21:52] appreciate them for their character for
[2:21:54] their nature for their loyalty their
[2:21:57] integrity you appreciate them
[2:22:00] you don't have to have a whole lot of
[2:22:02] exper confession and I urge you just
[2:22:04] take the take the message. It's not
[2:22:09] it's not just some words.
[2:22:14] You've had a you've had a relationship
[2:22:16] with this book,
[2:22:17] &gt;&gt; right?
[2:22:20] &gt;&gt; You know why you have a relationship?
[2:22:21] Because it's a person.
[2:22:26] &gt;&gt; And this person
[2:22:28] is a man and you're the bride. Amen.
[2:22:31] &gt;&gt; And this person has seed
[2:22:34] &gt;&gt; and that seed comes into your soul
[2:22:37] &gt;&gt; and that seed is ordained of almighty
[2:22:39] God to bring forth certain things and it
[2:22:42] will do so. Oh, I thank him for it. I
[2:22:46] want to maybe if we have the musicians
[2:22:49] please.
[2:23:01] Amen. Let's just bow our heads moment.
[2:23:04] Father in the quietness of this moment
[2:23:08] as we had prayer this morning and been
[2:23:12] praying till just coming to the pullpit
[2:23:15] praying oh God that your Holy Spirit
[2:23:19] would move in near to each individual.
[2:23:23] Take the words that have been spoken. I
[2:23:25] pray father they will be inspired by the
[2:23:27] Holy Ghost to look upon you to see you
[2:23:30] as a person to see the person of Jesus
[2:23:34] Christ to see the almighty one to see
[2:23:37] the creator for he has spoken all things
[2:23:40] into existence. Oh God that we might see
[2:23:43] you in all of your beauty in all of your
[2:23:46] glory that we might be inspired by
[2:23:49] looking. Father, I pray that your
[2:23:51] blessing, more than your blessing, but I
[2:23:54] pray that your voice, oh God, will be
[2:23:56] heard in the inner regions of our soul
[2:24:00] in Jesus Christ's name that you might be
[2:24:02] glorified.
[2:24:04] We ask it. Amen. I'll have you stand and
[2:24:08] I want to sing, turn your eyes upon
[2:24:10] Jesus. look full in his wonderful face,
[2:24:14] and the things of earth will grow
[2:24:16] strangely dim in the light of his glory
[2:24:19] and grace.
[2:24:22] [Music]
[2:24:30] &gt;&gt; Your eyes upon Jesus.
[2:24:37] Look forth
[2:24:39] in his wonderful
[2:24:42] face
[2:24:46] and the things
[2:24:48] of earth will grow strangely
[2:24:53] dim
[2:24:55] in the light
[2:24:57] of his glory
[2:25:00] and praise.
[2:25:04] Oh, turn
[2:25:06] your eyes upon Jesus.
[2:25:13] Look for
[2:25:15] in his wonderful
[2:25:18] face.
[2:25:22] And the things
[2:25:24] on earth will grow strangely
[2:25:29] dim

[2:26:43] Isn't it something that
[2:26:46] is almost overwhelming that God when we
[2:26:50] think when I think of all of creation
[2:26:52] and all that he's done and all of
[2:26:54] humanity
[2:26:56] I marvel how he found an individual how
[2:27:00] he found me.
[2:27:01] &gt;&gt; How he found you where you were and then
[2:27:04] in our state he showed mercy. Oh God,

[2:27:58] God rich in mercy.
[2:28:02] And while I was in prayer this morning,
[2:28:04] I began to say, "Let the beauty of Jesus
[2:28:08] be seen in me. All his
[2:28:13] wonderful love." Would you sing, Brother
[2:28:15] Derek, please help me out here

[2:29:18] nature, oh thou spirit divine,

[2:32:11] Oh blessed Lord,
[2:32:14] blessed Lord Jesus,
[2:32:16] [Music]
[2:32:18] precious Lord Jesus.
[2:32:20] If you had not become me,
[2:32:23] we could never become you.
[2:32:28] You became me.
[2:32:31] You took my load. You took our load.
[2:32:35] All of these inadequacies and All this
[2:32:39] fleshly life, oh God, you took it. That
[2:32:43] we could come to know you in the beauty
[2:32:45] of holiness and righteousness.
[2:32:49] That we become like you and find out
[2:32:52] that we are possessors of eternal life.
[2:32:56] Oh God, oh God, what grace is this? What
[2:33:00] grace is this, Lord, that you should
[2:33:02] look upon us? You looked upon us so that
[2:33:05] we could look upon you.
[2:33:07] We didn't know you, oh God. We were so
[2:33:10] weward. We were so confused. But you
[2:33:13] looked upon us and you looked upon us as
[2:33:15] you spoke through the prophet. You saw
[2:33:17] us in the wilderness. You saw us in the
[2:33:19] desert. You saw us wallowing in our own
[2:33:21] blood.
[2:33:23] You came and you had mercy and you
[2:33:25] picked us up and you bathed us and you
[2:33:27] washed us, oh God. And you said, "You
[2:33:29] are clean now. You are clean through the
[2:33:31] word that I spoke."
[2:33:34] Oh God, as we hear this word, give this
[2:33:36] people a revelation that what has been
[2:33:37] spoken through your prophet, through
[2:33:39] your messenger, through your servant is
[2:33:41] one that is a washing water of the word,
[2:33:45] oh God, to cleanse us. And how we need
[2:33:48] this cleansing daily, daily. We need
[2:33:51] this cleansing. Cleanse our minds.
[2:33:53] Cleanse our thoughts, oh God. Cleanse
[2:33:56] our nature, Father. Refine it, I pray.
[2:33:59] Refine it.
[2:34:01] refinest, Lord, until you begin to see
[2:34:05] your own image in the beaten gold. The
[2:34:08] gold, the nature, the character, the
[2:34:11] gold character. Oh God, I pray for all
[2:34:15] that are under the sound of my voice
[2:34:17] that you'll create within them a great
[2:34:19] desire, a hunger. Create within them an
[2:34:22] intense desire for you,
[2:34:25] Lord. It seems as though we can't even
[2:34:28] really know love without you putting it
[2:34:30] in our hearts.
[2:34:31] &gt;&gt; Oh, what grace is just put the love in
[2:34:33] our hearts, oh God, that we might
[2:34:36] express it to you.
[2:34:38] &gt;&gt; Blessed Lord. Blessed Lord. Thank you
[2:34:41] for this time, Lord. We we hear of those
[2:34:43] that are suffering in the Philippines
[2:34:45] and other parts of the world. Lord, in
[2:34:48] those prayer requests which have been
[2:34:49] prayed, and there are many that were
[2:34:51] unspoken,
[2:34:52] oh God, many needs, homes that are in
[2:34:56] need, lives that are in need. Oh,
[2:34:58] Father, reach out to those, oh God, who
[2:35:01] are yet resisting you and yet resisting
[2:35:04] you w- without any purpose, Lord. And
[2:35:08] they know that it is it's impossible for
[2:35:10] them to continue the direction they're
[2:35:13] going because they must yield. They know
[2:35:15] that they're children of God. They must
[2:35:17] yield. And there may be some even here
[2:35:20] today, Lord, who have not been fully
[2:35:23] touched or fully yielded to you. I pray,
[2:35:25] oh God, you'll break every obstacle that
[2:35:28] hinders them. Break every hindrance that
[2:35:30] hinders them, Lord. And may they cry out
[2:35:33] and call out and say, "You are my Lord.
[2:35:35] You're my God. You're my redeemer.
[2:35:39] You're my all and all. And all that I
[2:35:42] have, I surrender to you. I give to you.
[2:35:47] Oh Jesus,
[2:35:49] we want to tell you before this service
[2:35:52] is over. That we love you
[2:35:55] that you ever reached out to us. It's
[2:35:58] beyond our understanding. It's beyond
[2:36:00] the grasp of our thoughts. But that you
[2:36:03] did indeed. For God so loved the world.
[2:36:06] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Not only the world but we as
[2:36:09] individuals.
[2:36:11] He gave his only begotten son. Oh God,
[2:36:17] we thank you now.
[2:36:19] &gt;&gt; How we thank you
[2:36:23] my Jesus.
[2:36:28] I love thee.
[2:36:32] I know
[2:36:34] thou art mine
[2:36:39] for thee
[2:36:43] all the fallies
[2:36:48] of sin.
[2:36:50] I resign.

[2:37:30] I love
[2:37:32] thee, my Jesus
[2:37:38] is done. Could you say that again? If
[2:37:43] ever
[2:37:46] &gt;&gt; I love
[2:37:50] my Jesus.
[2:37:56] &gt;&gt; Isn't that lovely just to say it? My
[2:38:00] Jesus,
[2:38:01] if ever I loved thee,
[2:38:04] my Jesus, it's now going to come.
[2:38:08] [Music]

[2:39:25] brother Brandham often did this and he
[2:39:26] had people reach out to a person next to
[2:39:28] them, near them, in front of them,
[2:39:33] put their hand upon their shoulder and
[2:39:36] pray for them. And as we sing this once
[2:39:39] again, I love you.
[2:39:43] Let's pray for someone that may be
[2:39:46] having a more difficult time.
[2:39:50] Pray that God will lift burdens. Pray
[2:39:52] that God will restore the joy of
[2:39:54] salvation. Pray that the Holy Spirit
[2:39:56] will draw them near to them. Let's pray
[2:39:59] for one another. Pray for your child,
[2:40:02] your young person that's beside you, a
[2:40:05] brother or a sister.
[2:40:07] My Jesus,
[2:40:12] I'll love
[2:40:15] thee.

[2:40:19] thou art mine.
