[13:58] We appreciate you, Father.
[14:01] We thank you for all your blessings,
[14:03] Lord.
[14:05] &gt;&gt; Amen. Just going to invite brother John
[14:08] Andes to come and lead us to the throne
[14:10] of grace. And I have a prayer request
[14:13] here from Sister Lorie Snow to pray for
[14:17] her dad who is undergoing surgery
[14:23] uh tomorrow for his eye. And she's just
[14:27] asking us to remember him and that the
[14:29] Lord would guide the surgeon's hand and
[14:31] all would be well. Amen.
[14:36] Bless you, brother John.
[14:40] just hold our needs up before the Lord
[14:42] together as believers.
[14:44] Lord, what a privilege to be able to
[14:46] come into your house.
[14:48] &gt;&gt; We want to say thank you, Lord, for
[14:49] providing this opportunity for us
[14:53] &gt;&gt; that in the midst of gross darkness,
[14:55] famine in the land,
[14:57] &gt;&gt; disaster all around, that you've brought
[15:00] us to your side and called us into your
[15:02] tent, Lord. Oh father, we come into the
[15:05] tent of this sanctuary and want to lay
[15:07] aside everything of our lives that's
[15:10] would be distracting or of this world or
[15:13] in our own lives. We just want to lay it
[15:15] aside right now. May the cleansing touch
[15:18] of Jesus and that blood that we've just
[15:20] sang about come down and touch each
[15:23] life. Lord, we believe and there's power
[15:25] in that blood is able to come into every
[15:28] heart and make the vilest sinner whole.
[15:31] Lord, it's limitless, Lord, what you're
[15:33] able to do in a heart that believes all
[15:36] things are possible. So Lord, as
[15:38] believers, we've come, Lord, wanting to
[15:40] shake off the world and come into this
[15:42] atmosphere of your divine presence, just
[15:45] wanting divine love to soak down into
[15:47] our innermost being.
[15:49] Oh, Father, Lord, what you can do in
[15:51] just a few minutes, just five minutes in
[15:54] your presence, just a word from you,
[15:57] Lord, can turn a life change a
[16:00] situation. We're looking for direction.
[16:02] We're looking for leadership. We're
[16:04] asking for your provision for every
[16:06] life. As the families gathered around
[16:09] the table, we have confidence in you,
[16:12] Lord. Just hearing your prophet this
[16:14] morning speak about the great wall and
[16:17] how there's gifts in the body that
[16:19] you've placed to look up over that wall.
[16:22] We came, Lord, myself, our families, all
[16:25] of us. Lord, we have confidence in the
[16:28] gifts of God. The prophet that looked up
[16:30] over the wall and saw way down to your
[16:33] coming that we would have meat and food
[16:36] in due season even for July 2014.
[16:40] There's power in the word. There's
[16:43] enough power in your word to give us a
[16:45] new body. Place us into the rapture,
[16:48] Lord, for our children, for our unsaved
[16:51] loved ones, for any sick that might be
[16:54] here. Sister Lorie's father has need of
[16:57] a great physician for his eye. Would you
[17:00] be present, Lord God? There's unspoken
[17:03] request here, Lord. We have confidence
[17:05] in you that you have brought us up over
[17:08] the fence to look into this evil age
[17:11] that there would be light at the end
[17:13] time. We believe our prophet was one of
[17:16] those gifts. We believe our pastor is
[17:18] one of those gifts. And as you use his
[17:21] gift, Lord, this morning to move us up
[17:24] over the wall of circumstance, up over
[17:26] the wall of unbelief, that we as eagles,
[17:29] Lord, will be able to dig down deep into
[17:31] the word. Hallelujah. Lord, we love your
[17:34] appearing.
[17:37] Don't just talk between the lines, Lord.
[17:39] There's needs among us. Take all the fog
[17:42] away, Lord. Any scales, Lord. This is
[17:45] our one service, Lord. We want to dig
[17:47] deep in the spirit of revelation. We
[17:50] don't want the world, Lord, to come in
[17:52] and blindside us. We believe, Lord,
[17:55] these gifts can look up over and see
[17:57] down the road. You can use these
[17:59] ministries. Our brother Tim Dodd, our
[18:01] brother Tom Ray, our brother Murphy, you
[18:04] used him. These gifts are in the body.
[18:06] We thank you for them, Lord, for they're
[18:09] given as the dress wear to clothe our
[18:12] nakedness that we be able to come into
[18:14] your presence and know that our sins are
[18:16] under the blood. We can have divine
[18:19] relationship with Jesus Christ. So take
[18:22] everything under your divine control
[18:24] today. In all of our lives, we bring
[18:26] subject and we fall down on our knees as
[18:29] worshippers. Bless this offering. Lord,
[18:33] multiply it, God. Some aren't able to
[18:35] give, but I know their hearts would be
[18:37] wanting to give. May you bless their
[18:39] lives and give those that do give, Lord,
[18:42] an extra blessing today. We are in your
[18:44] house, Lord. We are your family and we
[18:47] love your appearing and we love every
[18:49] time Lord that we can sing songs and
[18:52] lift up these hands and say amen to the
[18:55] word. Go out on the internet Lord and
[18:58] just may there be a great movement in
[19:00] your bride today Lord of faith and of
[19:03] believing all things are possible Lord.
[19:07] We love you Jesus. We thank you for what
[19:09] you're going to do today. We believe
[19:12] today, Lord, chains are going to be
[19:14] broken, God, and hearts are going to be
[19:16] set free. We're going to go home saying,
[19:18] "Our hearts we're burning within us
[19:21] today as we heard you step out of the
[19:24] shadows. And you spoke to me and my
[19:27] heart is full. My cup is overflowing,
[19:30] God. For you are the greatest thing in
[19:32] all of our lives, Lord.
[19:34] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Jesus. Lord,
[19:38] &gt;&gt; thank you for answering the prayers of
[19:39] your people. We give you this day, this
[19:42] morning service in Jesus Christ's name.
[19:46] Amen.
[19:47] &gt;&gt; Amen.

[23:04] &gt;&gt; Oh, he's worthy of our praise.
[23:07] &gt;&gt; Amen. Couple of announcements.
[23:09] Um there's a prayer meeting this Friday
[23:13] and also on the 25th. So, this is the
[23:15] 11th and then two weeks is the 25th. And
[23:18] brother Tom also has an announcement and
[23:20] I'm just going to call him up this time.
[23:26] &gt;&gt; Well, this is a camp announcement, but
[23:28] it's a a pre-amp announcement. Um, I
[23:32] don't know how many of you have been
[23:33] aware, but we are going to have uh a
[23:36] group from China coming to join us at
[23:39] camp. And the number right now is 24.
[23:43] So, um there's brothers that go out on
[23:45] the mission field. Now you can be the
[23:48] mission field. And uh we're just making
[23:50] a preliminary announcement because uh
[23:53] we're needing to billet them for uh
[23:55] they're coming in on the um 18th of July
[24:00] and we'll be leaving on the 8th of
[24:02] August. But in between that we have camp
[24:04] of course and we're going to be putting
[24:06] them up at camp for the whole week. And
[24:08] so it's just going to our camp this
[24:10] year. I don't know what is going on, but
[24:12] it's the largest camp we've ever had in
[24:14] all of our history of camps. And they're
[24:16] coming from the east and the west and
[24:18] north and the south. But we have a large
[24:21] contingent coming from China. And um
[24:24] which is going to be a challenge because
[24:26] right now they have their American
[24:28] visas, but they don't have the Canadian
[24:30] ones. So Lord willing this week we'll
[24:32] find out whether they get their Canadian
[24:34] ones. So as of right now we have 24
[24:37] coming into Seattle. We'll need to move
[24:39] them from Seattle to homes. And the
[24:42] challenge then, of course, is
[24:43] communication. And of course, Roy, you
[24:46] can speak Chinese. I know that.
[24:49] But Sister Mary is here and Jason's here
[24:52] and different ones can speak Chinese.
[24:54] So, we will be building them with one
[24:56] that can uh translate English Chinese.
[24:59] So, if uh your home is available on both
[25:02] sides, whether it be Canadian, because
[25:03] there should be some that will be
[25:05] getting some Canadian visas on this
[25:06] side. And I know the um brother uh
[25:09] Ozales has opened his home already.
[25:11] Different ones have mentioned that they
[25:12] will take four or five, whatever.
[25:14] Brother Glenn, of course, we'll be
[25:15] taking some. So, no problem there. Um
[25:20] so, there's two ways we can do this. You
[25:22] can volunteer or we will volunteer you.
[25:25] No, I'm just we're just looking forward
[25:27] to having a wonderful time. They've come
[25:29] because of the effect of our young
[25:31] people over in China, their confidence
[25:34] in Brother Murphy and what God has done
[25:36] through his ministry. They have come to
[25:38] see you. They've come to be a part of
[25:40] our camp. And we want to open our uh our
[25:43] doors of compassion. We want to be able
[25:45] to give them a wonderful time around the
[25:47] word of God and in our homes.
[25:49] &gt;&gt; So, if you wouldn't mind getting a hold
[25:51] of Sister Megan Drake at the office this
[25:53] week and um what what you can absorb in
[25:56] your home, that would be great. and then
[25:58] we will work it out over the next couple
[26:00] of weeks. God bless you, brother
[26:02] Clarence. Sister Audrey, nice to have
[26:04] you back. We've missed you. God bless
[26:06] you. Well, you're gone a month.
[26:09] &gt;&gt; Six weeks. It see it seemed like six
[26:11] months, but it's nice to have you back.
[26:14] God bless you all.
[26:21] &gt;&gt; Let's just sing uh a chorus together and
[26:24] Sister Joanne will have a special for
[26:26] us. Um, all hail King Jesus.
[26:31] All hail King Jesus.

[36:09] and greet you in the name of the Lord
[36:11] Jesus Christ.

[36:16] to all those from the US side. Uh you're
[36:21] you're celebrating your independence day
[36:25] and July the 4th and so we congratulate
[36:28] you for that. Uh, God bless our brother

[36:40] &gt;&gt; Love them so faithful. God bless you.
[36:44] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[36:44] &gt;&gt; Brother Edwin is a veteran from the US
[36:48] Air Force and and uh has certainly
[36:52] served a notable
[36:54] service to that country.
[36:58] And we also as Canadians we must say we
[37:02] appreciate America.
[37:04] Uh they've been a great protector for us
[37:08] as well. Have done very much. And uh so
[37:12] we we thank God for every person. Nice
[37:16] to see our brother and sister Gerard
[37:18] here from Tucson. God bless you. I did
[37:21] see you in the in the hallway. And then
[37:26] uh I see that brotherh
[37:29] brother brother Clarence and sister
[37:30] Audrey are back and have been welcomed.
[37:34] And uh we're all back.
[37:38] We're all here.
[37:39] &gt;&gt; Amen. Some away today on the on this
[37:42] vacation time, but we're glad you're not
[37:45] all on vacation or I wouldn't have
[37:47] anybody to preach to.
[37:50] But you're here. God bless you. Thank
[37:52] you. Let's just ask the Lord to bless
[37:55] the word a moment.
[37:58] Dear heavenly father, we stand amazed in
[38:01] the presence of Jesus Christ.
[38:06] &gt;&gt; Not only the Nazarene, but one that was
[38:09] loved and hated both.
[38:12] One that gave himself a sacrifice for
[38:15] us. We want to speak about that.
[38:18] Oh God, I pray that you will make this
[38:21] message more than a sermon.
[38:25] &gt;&gt; Make it something, Father, that'll be a
[38:27] milestone in the people's hearts. I pray
[38:30] &gt;&gt; we have not many days perhaps. We have
[38:33] not much time, oh God.
[38:35] &gt;&gt; We want to have the greatest effect we
[38:37] can upon the earth.
[38:38] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[38:39] &gt;&gt; Bless your people, I pray, and their
[38:41] witness, oh God. Let the Holy Spirit
[38:44] reverberate through every life
[38:47] &gt;&gt; that is not only here, but those that
[38:49] are away, those that are streaming the
[38:52] service. We've heard from some even in
[38:55] the last few days how they are blessed
[38:58] by streaming and being part of the
[38:59] congregation. And we say, Father, bless
[39:02] them. Send your blessings their way.
[39:06] regardless of what country they may be
[39:07] in or what condition they may be in. I
[39:10] pray that you will send your healing
[39:12] power to everyone that is sick and
[39:15] deliverance to those that are bound.
[39:18] &gt;&gt; I pray that you'll loose the people, oh
[39:20] God, and let a spirit of divine
[39:21] revelation
[39:23] &gt;&gt; come upon each one, Father, that we
[39:25] might see where we're at
[39:27] &gt;&gt; and the season of our time that we're
[39:30] in. Oh God, in the name of Jesus Christ,
[39:33] your blessings now we pray. Amen.
[39:36] &gt;&gt; Amen. I'm going to have you just have
[39:38] your seats for a few moments.
[39:43] There's only one service today and we're
[39:46] not going to try to abuse that. But I
[39:51] did want to say that uh I know that
[39:53] brother Tim Dodd had had uh held this
[39:56] message this book rather not message
[39:59] book but it's uh it's the revelation of
[40:02] Jesus Christ series. the entire series
[40:05] done in one book. It's done by Yola's
[40:08] father. Uh and uh we're h certainly
[40:12] happy to have Sister Yola here who has
[40:14] come. Would you stand Yola? So uh those
[40:19] there she is. That's brother Jacques's
[40:22] daughter.
[40:25] and uh
[40:27] brother Jacques he's they live in Czech
[40:29] Republic
[40:31] uh but have uh he's he he translates
[40:35] into the Polish language and I should
[40:37] say not just a translator he's a
[40:39] perfectionist in the language and this
[40:42] is uh I believe 296 pages no I'm sorry
[40:46] 496 pages and they had it printed in uh
[40:50] in in Poland for $166 per book and I
[40:55] thought that was remarkable.
[40:57] &gt;&gt; That's absolutely remarkable. So, we
[41:00] have committed ourselves to $2,000 to
[41:03] pay for the first 1,200 of these that
[41:05] he's ordered. He just ordered 1,200
[41:08] because he felt that was all that he
[41:10] could handle. So, we said that we I I
[41:13] committed myself while I was in in
[41:15] Switzerland that we would like to do
[41:17] that. That's a really a masterful piece
[41:20] of work and we really appreciate he's
[41:22] he's translated for about 30 years and
[41:25] if you you should just try translating
[41:27] one one message once you find out it's a
[41:30] it's a real task. So we we praise God
[41:34] for brother Jacques's work.
[41:35] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[41:37] &gt;&gt; Amen. I would like to say with regards
[41:39] to the service today,
[41:42] uh,
[41:44] I was sitting on the platform while
[41:45] brother Murphy was preaching and I
[41:47] already had a a phrase. Sometimes the
[41:51] Holy Spirit will just speak a phrase and
[41:53] how do you know it's the Holy Spirit?
[41:55] Well, the Holy Spirit won't let go. It
[41:58] just keep saying the same thing and just
[42:00] keep repeating the same thing. That's
[42:02] how you always know if it's if it's God
[42:04] or is it just your own mind or
[42:06] something. You'll just feel a a a nudge.
[42:09] You'll just feel uh a voice, inner
[42:12] voice. It'll just keep saying the same
[42:14] thing. Always the same thing. And uh
[42:17] it's not guilt and it's not
[42:19] condemnation.
[42:20] It's not it's not anything of that
[42:22] nature, but it it might be something you
[42:24] don't understand. And the phrase was
[42:28] uh the end thereof. The end thereof. And
[42:32] I thought, yeah, what about the end
[42:34] thereof? I know we're in the end time
[42:37] and the end thereof.
[42:39] And uh so I was thinking about that and
[42:43] just pondering it and I was listening to
[42:45] brother Murphy preach and a a strange
[42:49] scripture came to me. And uh it was as
[42:53] Jesus was coming to the end of his life
[42:57] here on earth. And uh and the Bible is
[43:01] telling us that the the the women and
[43:04] people were going along and he had been
[43:07] condemned. and and they went along and
[43:11] were weeping and lamenting over him. And
[43:15] then Jesus turned and said, "Uh, don't
[43:18] weep for me, but weep for yourself and
[43:22] for your children, for the days will
[43:24] come." So, right away, it it connected,
[43:27] and I didn't even recognize it
[43:28] connecting right at that moment. I was
[43:30] connecting with the end time for the
[43:34] days will come uh when they will say
[43:37] blessed are the womb that has not did
[43:40] not bear and the paps that did not give
[43:42] suck and I thought that was a strange
[43:46] statement. So the message is really
[43:50] uh having to do with that scripture, but
[43:52] it's not a sermon. That's not I'm not
[43:54] preaching a sermon. It's more of a more
[43:56] of a study. And we have quite a bit of
[43:59] reading because then I was directed into
[44:01] brother Brandham's message, the present
[44:04] stage of my ministry.
[44:06] &gt;&gt; And uh as a prophet, things are
[44:09] prophetic. and and it's just amazing how
[44:12] he he continued on a very precise
[44:17] uh course through that message and and
[44:21] not only speaking of the season that he
[44:23] was in but what it would come to. And so
[44:28] I wanted to see if he had said anything
[44:31] about
[44:32] Jesus when he said if this was done in a
[44:35] green tree.
[44:38] He said to the women, "Don't lament over
[44:40] me and weep over me. For if this was
[44:42] done for if they do this in a green
[44:44] tree, what will they do in a dry?" And
[44:48] right away I I while Brother Murphy's
[44:50] preaching, I'm thinking green tree, but
[44:53] he was the tree of life. and then uh a
[44:57] tree of life. And I thought, I wonder if
[44:59] Brother Brandham ever referred to that
[45:01] refers to it once and I'm going to go
[45:04] into it with you. It just incredible. It
[45:08] would take a prophetic eye
[45:10] &gt;&gt; to go where he went in the scriptures.
[45:13] And so, um, with that, I will, uh, I
[45:18] will have you stand and we'll read a
[45:21] scripture.
[45:25] It's uh found in Luke the 23rd chapter.
[45:34] And while you're standing and while
[45:36] we're getting ready to turn, uh or while
[45:38] you're turning,
[45:41] uh my comments this morning and what we
[45:43] will go into is not it not personal or
[45:49] or of any other person. This is not
[45:52] reference to myself personally or anyone
[45:55] else personal. Uh but the person of
[45:58] Jesus Christ
[46:01] uh everyone that has Jesus Christ
[46:04] dwelling in them will experience the
[46:07] same things,
[46:08] &gt;&gt; the same characteristics that we speak
[46:10] of this morning. And the message this
[46:13] morning is in reference to the
[46:16] revelation of Jesus Christ. Jesus Christ
[46:18] the person in this hour. Now, brother
[46:20] Brandham's ministry, I mean, I want to
[46:23] lodge this as a almost like a for
[46:26] statement. His ministry was a
[46:30] dispensational ministry.
[46:33] That is why it becomes the target
[46:36] of all of intense love.
[46:39] &gt;&gt; Right?
[46:41] &gt;&gt; Uh love that is so great that it is
[46:44] misunderstood.
[46:46] So they it's it's commonly said, well,
[46:49] they make him deity.
[46:52] Uh oh, I'll just stop there. Jesus said,
[46:55] I is he deity?
[47:00] &gt;&gt; Will be in you.
[47:02] &gt;&gt; What does that do? Well, depends on how
[47:05] much you want to water that down.
[47:08] &gt;&gt; If you want to water it down or if it
[47:10] means what it says.
[47:12] &gt;&gt; And I prefer to say it means what it
[47:14] says.
[47:14] &gt;&gt; Amen. It doesn't make us gods, of
[47:17] course, but it may make us messiahs
[47:22] &gt;&gt; because deity will be in you if you
[47:24] allow and yield to that.
[47:28] &gt;&gt; And uh and then uh now
[47:31] I want to also just make reference to
[47:34] life here.
[47:37] Life here in this place that we have has
[47:41] essential requirements
[47:43] that is placed on all of us. We have to
[47:46] have a home place where we live,
[47:51] family, friends or someone close.
[47:54] We need those relationships.
[47:57] We need pure religion or religion.
[48:00] People need religion. So all over the
[48:03] earth they worship somehow some way.
[48:06] &gt;&gt; They bow and do obesence to something.
[48:10] We have economics and we've got to earn
[48:13] and we have to pay our bills. We all
[48:15] have to do that. We need some RNR. We
[48:18] need to have time to relax to gather
[48:21] ourselves together to rest or
[48:24] and the world has the whole world of
[48:26] entertainment and the whole world of
[48:28] sports and the whole world of something
[48:31] to catch themselves up. People have to
[48:33] have that as well. We have to have our
[48:37] education
[48:39] uh regardless of how little or how much
[48:42] of it. But we need education
[48:44] and we need uh we have concerns
[48:47] concerning health health issues. Uh as
[48:51] you get older you think about you know
[48:53] how am I going to manage when I can't
[48:55] work
[48:57] don't have to say retirement as such but
[48:59] you know how how is that going to
[49:01] happen? What's going to happen if you
[49:03] know we fall sick or something like
[49:05] that. So we have those things but then I
[49:07] want to stop there and say all of these
[49:10] essential areas
[49:12] have been permeated. Are you listening?
[49:16] Have been permeated by Satan. Right.
[49:20] &gt;&gt; He's invaded every single one of those
[49:23] to such a degree and homogen homogenized
[49:27] himself with them until it's almost
[49:30] impossible to separate what is
[49:32] essential, what God recognizes as being
[49:36] essential to life and what Satan has to
[49:39] attract to distract us from the truth
[49:42] and to attract us to him.
[49:46] &gt;&gt; That's right. So with that we'll just
[49:48] read.
[49:52] &gt;&gt; And there followed him a great company
[49:54] of people. I'm sorry this is starting
[49:55] with verse 27.
[49:57] And there followed him a great company
[50:00] of people and of women all which also
[50:03] bewailed and lamented him. But Jesus
[50:07] turning unto them said,"Daughters of
[50:09] Jerusalem,
[50:10] weep not for me, but weep for yourselves
[50:14] and for your children. For behold, the
[50:17] days are coming, in the which they shall
[50:20] say, "Blessed are the barren, and the
[50:22] wombs that never bear, and the paps
[50:25] which never gave suck." Then shall they
[50:28] begin to say to the mountains, "Fall on
[50:31] us," and to the hills, "Cover us." For
[50:35] if they do the these things in a green
[50:38] tree, what shall be done in the dry?
[50:44] The prophet Jeremiah has said, you can
[50:47] just listen as I read this one verse.
[50:49] The prophets prophesy falsely,
[50:52] and the priests bear rule by their
[50:55] means, and my people love it to have it
[50:58] so.
[51:00] And what will you do in the end thereof?
[51:04] And that's where I came up to the title,
[51:07] what will you do in the end thereof? You
[51:09] may be seated.
[51:19] It'll be very necessary for you to keep
[51:21] your thinking caps on and to follow very
[51:23] closely
[51:26] because this service is one that I
[51:28] intend to hold to my notes as close as I
[51:31] can and and uh I have a lot that I will
[51:34] read with you as well.
[51:37] In the true Easter seal,
[51:40] brother Bram said, "He also broke
[51:42] another seal that I want to speak of
[51:44] here
[51:45] found over in Exodus. When man had
[51:48] sinned and separated himself from the
[51:50] presence of God, and he came to worship
[51:53] God, there was a veil that hung between
[51:56] the holy and the holiest of holies.
[51:59] Inside the holiest of holies was the
[52:02] shikina glory.
[52:04] They were not permitted to go in there.
[52:07] They were not permitted even to look of
[52:09] look of it. And a man going in there had
[52:12] to be anointed once a year, dressed
[52:14] right, blood on him, blood in his in his
[52:18] hand, blood in the charger to sprinkle
[52:22] the mercy seat. But oh brother,
[52:26] when it was sprinkled that day with the
[52:28] blood of Jesus Christ,
[52:31] &gt;&gt; the spirit of God rent the seal from the
[52:34] top to the bottom and brought man back.
[52:40] &gt;&gt; Jesus said, "If they do this in a green
[52:44] tree,
[52:46] that's the only place I found this in
[52:48] the message.
[52:50] If they do this in a green tree, what
[52:52] will they do in a dry? And if they did
[52:56] that to him being the green tree of
[53:00] life,
[53:02] what will it be done to the old dead
[53:04] formal tree that has no life? Now, when
[53:08] the wrath of God, now we're coming to
[53:11] the end because Jesus is just coming to
[53:13] when the full extent of God's wrath that
[53:16] will be poured out upon him.
[53:19] And when the wrath of God is poured out,
[53:22] how can the old dead formal tree stand
[53:24] it? When the green tree, it even
[53:27] perished. The green tree and sent it to
[53:31] hell. I was thinking of the tree of
[53:34] life.
[53:36] Listen friends, the tree of life
[53:38] &gt;&gt; went to hell for you and I
[53:41] &gt;&gt; because that was our penalty.
[53:43] &gt;&gt; And if it didn't, then it didn't. He
[53:45] didn't take the full penalty. Amen.
[53:48] &gt;&gt; He took the full penalty and sent it to
[53:51] hell. The wrath of God poured out for
[53:54] disobedience of sin sent the green tree
[53:57] to hell. What will it do in a dry tree
[54:01] when it strikes it? If the righteous
[54:03] will be scarcely saved, where will the
[54:07] sinner and ungodly appear?
[54:10] That person that rejects the way, that
[54:13] person that knows better, that person
[54:16] that's been revealed to him that he
[54:18] still refuses to walk in God's way. What
[54:22] will happen to that person? What is it
[54:24] going to be? Yes, he broke the seal that
[54:28] kept us from the shikina glory because
[54:31] sin was finished.
[54:35] Jesus gives a particular reason and I
[54:38] was reading of another writer I believe
[54:40] in Matthew Henry's commentary just
[54:44] portions
[54:45] uh because the message of the hour my
[54:48] commentary
[54:50] Jesus gives a particular reason why they
[54:52] should weep for themselves and for their
[54:55] children.
[54:57] He said that what people
[55:00] normally dread and these are my words uh
[55:03] as I read out of one writer in Matthew
[55:07] Henry's what people normally dread
[55:12] that they would actually desire
[55:15] said blessed are the they would the days
[55:18] will come when they will say blessed are
[55:20] the wombs that don't bear that's not
[55:22] what we desire
[55:24] &gt;&gt; people desire to have children desire
[55:27] ire to have someone to love. They desire
[55:31] that and some are not able to have that.
[55:33] We understand that. And there has been
[55:35] prayer made for those that have not had
[55:38] children and and God has answered
[55:40] marvelously. And then the others there's
[55:43] others and sitting here in this
[55:44] congregation and perhaps listening to me
[55:47] today and will listen to this that have
[55:49] not been able to have children and God
[55:51] knows that and there's some reason for
[55:53] that. But we commit that as if you're a
[55:55] believer then you just thank God for it.
[55:59] &gt;&gt; But there are some and then and but that
[56:01] is something. So Jesus is saying they
[56:04] will say blessed are the womb that
[56:06] blessed is the womb that doesn't bear.
[56:07] But yet that's not what a woman would
[56:10] desire. They would desire to bear and
[56:13] the paps that never gave suck. And he
[56:16] said for the days will come when they
[56:17] will say that because something's going
[56:20] to happen. In other words, it will be
[56:22] better that way for the conditions that
[56:25] are around for the things that are
[56:27] taking place for the world that has sunk
[56:31] into the vile filth and vengeance of
[56:35] this day. When law and order can
[56:38] scarcely keep things together and when
[56:41] we find the days and the conditions that
[56:43] we are in and people are saying it's
[56:46] better not to even have children.
[56:49] Multitudes, millions never get married,
[56:52] don't want to get married. It's too big
[56:55] a headache. The dangers are too the the
[56:58] potential for danger and heartbreak is
[57:00] too great. And are some that have had
[57:03] marriage and have had divorce and have
[57:05] had marriage and divorce and then they
[57:08] were filled with all that's why brother
[57:10] Brandham came to that subject and we're
[57:12] not coming to that subject. Those are
[57:14] painful things friends. Those are very
[57:17] painful things. You cannot even weigh
[57:20] the pain that people have have endured
[57:25] that. And so Jesus is saying the day
[57:28] will come.
[57:29] &gt;&gt; And that a lot of the writers in the
[57:31] commentaries want to uh attribute all of
[57:34] that, but Matthew Henry didn't attribute
[57:37] all of that to the destruction of
[57:39] Jerusalem. That the days are coming and
[57:41] that that would be when Jerusalem is
[57:43] destroyed by Titus that the people would
[57:46] say, "Oh, it better not to have
[57:48] children." Well, that wasn't the full
[57:50] reference to it because dispensationally
[57:53] now we've come to an end time.
[57:56] H how can you go in in one lifetime
[57:59] you're looking at a person that never
[58:01] used to lock their door? I never locked
[58:03] our door. I never locked the car. It
[58:06] didn't even I thought people were crazy
[58:09] and nuts to lock their door. What do you
[58:11] want to lock your door for? Nothing's
[58:13] going to happen. That was in my time.
[58:15] When I was a young married man with
[58:17] children,
[58:18] &gt;&gt; we never locked our door. Well, we do
[58:21] today. And and you say, "Well, don't you
[58:24] trust God?" Well, yeah. I trust God. I
[58:26] also trust the locks.
[58:30] There's just, you know, that's just uh
[58:34] Do you lock your door?
[58:37] &gt;&gt; I'm sure most people do. You have an
[58:38] alarm system and all of those things.
[58:41] Why, you know, anyhow, uh we'll go on
[58:45] from there.
[58:47] Often those that have no children envy
[58:49] those that have children.
[58:52] Then those that have children very often
[58:55] find themselves
[58:57] uh find them such a burden
[59:00] especially in attempting to escape the
[59:02] attraction of the world. These are my
[59:05] words or the grief of seeing them suffer
[59:09] and dying from famine
[59:12] from disease from wars.
[59:15] I'm sure that we can sit here in our
[59:18] comfort and sit here in the safety of
[59:20] this country. Let me tell you something.
[59:23] Safety can disappear very quickly.
[59:27] &gt;&gt; Things can change in a moment of time.
[59:30] People that put their trust in the e
[59:32] economy. The economics can collapse.
[59:35] Even the people who are in charge of the
[59:37] economics realize it can just go
[59:39] downhill overnight.
[59:41] &gt;&gt; We know that.
[59:42] &gt;&gt; And many here have experienced that.
[59:45] We've gone through recessions and
[59:47] depressions and whatever more. I stood
[59:50] as a boy watching my father peeling
[59:53] railroad ties
[59:56] for 10 cents a tie.
[59:59] You say, "Well, that was, you know, back
[1:00:01] in the dark ages." Not quite.
[1:00:04] That happens very, very quickly in one
[1:00:06] person's lifetime.
[1:00:08] Where'd the last 10 years go for you?
[1:00:12] Where some of you, where' the last 20
[1:00:14] years go for you? Just just gone like
[1:00:17] that. Isn't that so? And so they go on
[1:00:20] to say,
[1:00:22] and I just changed some words for my own
[1:00:24] self to make it more fitting. So we have
[1:00:27] the the the children that are in disease
[1:00:30] and the wars and so and I'm sure that
[1:00:34] those are people that have passed their
[1:00:36] mind too. Been better if I hadn't had
[1:00:39] these children to see their stomach
[1:00:41] swollen and to see you say, well I is
[1:00:44] this just to be, you know, is this just
[1:00:46] to kind of catch our attention? No. No,
[1:00:48] no, this is reality. This is what God
[1:00:51] sees. And there isn't one of those
[1:00:53] children that cry that but what God
[1:00:56] hears that if he hears the animals and
[1:00:58] the eagles and the birds and all the
[1:01:00] rest of it, he certainly hears creation
[1:01:03] &gt;&gt; that he made in his image.
[1:01:07] &gt;&gt; And and he says, "And they will envy
[1:01:10] those that have none, those that have
[1:01:12] brought children. Conditions will become
[1:01:15] and a good part of the world it's that
[1:01:17] way. even today
[1:01:20] &gt;&gt; when they will envy and blessed are the
[1:01:23] barren.
[1:01:24] But Satan is too subtle to just use like
[1:01:27] famine and disease and wars and
[1:01:29] sickness. What do we've got are
[1:01:34] gay parades?
[1:01:37] &gt;&gt; Are they celebrating children? Are they
[1:01:39] celebrating life?
[1:01:41] &gt;&gt; No, they're not.
[1:01:43] &gt;&gt; They're celebrating no children.
[1:01:46] They're celebrating no family.
[1:01:49] &gt;&gt; Are they celebrating raising children
[1:01:51] that are going to be scientists and
[1:01:54] astronauts or artists or teachers or
[1:01:57] preachers or what? No, they're not
[1:01:59] celebrating that. They're celebrating
[1:02:01] the fact that none are coming.
[1:02:06] Right?
[1:02:07] &gt;&gt; They're literally saying, "Blessed are
[1:02:09] the wombs that don't bear
[1:02:12] &gt;&gt; and the pops that don't don't give sir.
[1:02:18] &gt;&gt; I have your attention.
[1:02:21] &gt;&gt; This is the day.
[1:02:23] &gt;&gt; What will you do in the end thereof?"
[1:02:26] Yes.
[1:02:27] &gt;&gt; And Satan would like to uh I I I I
[1:02:31] prayed earnestly that God would help me
[1:02:32] and give me the words, but he's
[1:02:35] continuously and so persistently
[1:02:39] bringing something in front of the
[1:02:40] people, in front of message believers,
[1:02:43] just brings it. course language and vile
[1:02:46] living and all kinds of things and
[1:02:49] things that are and just such insanity
[1:02:52] just bring it until finally people say
[1:02:54] well you know that's the way it is and
[1:02:57] you know it becomes common place
[1:03:00] &gt;&gt; and finally accepted
[1:03:02] &gt;&gt; as the normal normal
[1:03:06] &gt;&gt; send Elijah send Moses send any of the
[1:03:09] prophets there would curse that thing
[1:03:12] &gt;&gt; and say this is not normal This is not
[1:03:14] holy.
[1:03:15] &gt;&gt; This is not of God. This is of another
[1:03:18] kingdom. This came from darkness.
[1:03:22] &gt;&gt; This is death.
[1:03:25] &gt;&gt; And the scripture tells us
[1:03:29] &gt;&gt; the scripture tells us that
[1:03:33] he will be very successful
[1:03:36] in the end. and all that dwell upon the
[1:03:39] earth shall worship him, do obedience to
[1:03:43] him,
[1:03:44] &gt;&gt; kneel to him. And that word is to
[1:03:46] actually like to take a hand and to kiss
[1:03:48] it and to be acceptance and to have a
[1:03:51] certain degree of reverence to it. And
[1:03:54] all that dwell upon the earth shall
[1:03:56] worship him whose names are not written
[1:03:58] in the book of life of the lamb's lamb
[1:04:01] from the foundation of the world. And
[1:04:03] when we read that, we must have
[1:04:05] something rise up within us. Thank you,
[1:04:08] Father, that you sent one worthy
[1:04:11] &gt;&gt; to open that book and to declare our
[1:04:14] names. And something that was spoken out
[1:04:17] from the revelation of Jesus Christ
[1:04:21] responds to me until I can say that's my
[1:04:25] name.
[1:04:28] &gt;&gt; I have been called. I don't know about
[1:04:31] the next person. I don't know about
[1:04:33] anyone else but my name was called
[1:04:36] something within says that's the life
[1:04:39] &gt;&gt; that's the craving I have
[1:04:42] &gt;&gt; that's what I respond to
[1:04:44] &gt;&gt; can you say amen to that
[1:04:50] &gt;&gt; don't get don't get comfortable
[1:04:52] &gt;&gt; with this world
[1:04:54] &gt;&gt; just keep saying this world is not my
[1:04:56] home
[1:04:58] &gt;&gt; I'm just a passing through
[1:05:01] My treasures are laid up somewhere
[1:05:04] beyond the blue.
[1:05:09] &gt;&gt; The results and consequences of sin
[1:05:12] evolve
[1:05:13] into con into into conditions so vile
[1:05:17] that a loving and just God responds with
[1:05:19] holy justice on a sin-loving Satan's
[1:05:23] Eden. Don't forget
[1:05:26] the green tree.
[1:05:28] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:05:28] &gt;&gt; The tree of life.
[1:05:31] paid a horrific consequence
[1:05:33] &gt;&gt; for us.
[1:05:34] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:05:35] &gt;&gt; Father, if it is possible,
[1:05:38] &gt;&gt; let this cup pass from me.
[1:05:40] &gt;&gt; Nevertheless, not my will, but thine be
[1:05:43] done.
[1:05:44] &gt;&gt; We don't want to just sit in so much
[1:05:46] comfort that we forget the penalty and
[1:05:48] as the prophet spoke, the terrible
[1:05:50] consequence and penalty of sin.
[1:05:53] &gt;&gt; We want to forever be thankful.
[1:05:56] &gt;&gt; We're thankful. We remembering on
[1:05:58] Remembrance Day those that have gone and
[1:06:01] and fought for us that we could be here
[1:06:03] in a in a degree of comfort and safety
[1:06:06] and so on. We're happy about that. We're
[1:06:09] thankful for that.
[1:06:11] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:06:12] &gt;&gt; And some of the best crop of the land of
[1:06:16] America, of Canada, and many other
[1:06:19] countries,
[1:06:20] &gt;&gt; right? They died in their youth 18, 19,
[1:06:23] 20, 21 in early 20s and and their blood
[1:06:27] soaked the earth
[1:06:28] &gt;&gt; so that we could have relatively
[1:06:31] relative freedom. But this can disappear
[1:06:34] very quickly
[1:06:35] &gt;&gt; and this is not, you know, something to
[1:06:38] startle the people. This is reality
[1:06:41] &gt;&gt; and much of the world is in a great deal
[1:06:44] of suffering because it's the end time.
[1:06:47] &gt;&gt; Amen. And the scripture says, God
[1:06:50] speaking, the scripture says, "And
[1:06:52] things shall wax worse and worse."
[1:06:56] &gt;&gt; Not better and better, but worse and
[1:06:58] worse.
[1:06:59] &gt;&gt; Friends, that's why we have an
[1:07:00] unchanging word of God,
[1:07:02] &gt;&gt; unchanging message and an uncompromising
[1:07:06] messenger. And I thank God for that.
[1:07:08] Amen.
[1:07:12] &gt;&gt; And then shall they begin to say to the
[1:07:15] mountains, "Fall on us, and to the
[1:07:17] hills, cover us." In other words, they
[1:07:19] would wish to be buried alive
[1:07:22] or hid in the darkest caves that they
[1:07:26] may be out of the noise of these
[1:07:28] calamities.
[1:07:32] and Revelation 6:16 that they would not
[1:07:35] flee to Christ for refuge but put
[1:07:38] themselves under his protection will in
[1:07:41] vain call for the hills and mountains to
[1:07:44] shelter them from his wrath. That's what
[1:07:47] the Bible speaks of.
[1:07:50] If they do these things in the green
[1:07:52] tree, what shall they do in the dry? If
[1:07:54] God delivers
[1:07:56] me up
[1:07:58] to such sufferings, speaking of Christ
[1:08:00] now, if God delivers Jesus up to such
[1:08:05] sufferings as the as these because
[1:08:08] because I made a sacrifice for sin, what
[1:08:12] will he do with sinners themselves?
[1:08:14] &gt;&gt; Christ was a green tree, fruitful and
[1:08:17] flourishing. Now if such things were
[1:08:20] done to him, we we may then infer what
[1:08:25] would have been done to the whole race
[1:08:28] of mankind if he had not interposed if
[1:08:31] he had not come
[1:08:34] &gt;&gt; and what shall be done to those who con
[1:08:37] who continue dry trees. Listen friends,
[1:08:40] I'm glad for a unco uncompromising
[1:08:43] message that identified the drive tree,
[1:08:48] &gt;&gt; the whole system of religion.
[1:08:50] &gt;&gt; I said earlier, Satan is so cunning.
[1:08:53] &gt;&gt; He's gotten into every area of life
[1:08:56] that's necessary to humankind. every
[1:08:59] area, whether it be politics, whether it
[1:09:02] be military, whether it be whatever
[1:09:04] power, whether it be educational,
[1:09:06] whether it be a person's love life or
[1:09:09] marriage or religion or whatever. And he
[1:09:12] he loves to be in religion so he can get
[1:09:15] behind the pullpit.
[1:09:23] &gt;&gt; He says, "If God did this to the son of
[1:09:27] his love,
[1:09:30] I was thinking very very deep.
[1:09:33] I've allowed my mind to go, my heart, my
[1:09:37] soul
[1:09:39] as I've read and pondered these things.
[1:09:42] God allowed Judas to betray him.
[1:09:45] &gt;&gt; God allowed Rome to play a part.
[1:09:48] &gt;&gt; God allowed the people to cry out,
[1:09:50] "Crucify! Crucify!" Right.
[1:09:53] &gt;&gt; But it was God's will
[1:09:56] &gt;&gt; in behind driving everything.
[1:09:59] &gt;&gt; And he gave those people an opportunity.
[1:10:02] &gt;&gt; Here he is. Do what you wish.
[1:10:04] &gt;&gt; That's why Jesus said, "You slew the
[1:10:06] prophets. You killed them everyone. I
[1:10:10] sent them to you
[1:10:11] &gt;&gt; and you did what you would
[1:10:13] &gt;&gt; to them."
[1:10:14] &gt;&gt; Right?
[1:10:15] &gt;&gt; In other words, they had the opportunity
[1:10:17] to hear the prophets.
[1:10:18] &gt;&gt; They had the opportunity to hear God's
[1:10:21] voice.
[1:10:21] &gt;&gt; Yeah. But God sent that so that they
[1:10:23] could make their choice and do what they
[1:10:25] wish to do with it. And now he said if
[1:10:29] God sent this if God did this to the son
[1:10:32] of his love when he found sin
[1:10:36] but but imputed to him. Jesus never
[1:10:40] sinned but taking your sin and my sin.
[1:10:44] And when God saw our sin
[1:10:48] &gt;&gt; on him,
[1:10:49] &gt;&gt; he sent the tree of life to hell
[1:10:52] &gt;&gt; to pay the full penalty. And in hell, he
[1:10:56] was still victorious. He was still a
[1:10:58] mighty conqueror. And he stripped the
[1:11:01] Satan of the keys of death, hell, and
[1:11:03] the grave. And arose again, and emptied
[1:11:06] out paradise. Hallelujah. From Eve and
[1:11:10] Adam all the way through. Who is it?
[1:11:13] It's the son of righteousness
[1:11:15] &gt;&gt; that has risen with healing in his
[1:11:17] wings.
[1:11:18] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:11:20] [Music]
[1:11:21] &gt;&gt; And he says and and what shall God what
[1:11:24] shall he do to the generation of his
[1:11:26] wrath?
[1:11:28] See, that's why I say it's not just
[1:11:30] Jerusalem.
[1:11:31] What shall he do? Look what he did with
[1:11:33] Titus and and all the rest of it because
[1:11:35] they rejected Jesus Christ. That might
[1:11:38] that's very localized. But now we're
[1:11:41] people of the earth. Yeah,
[1:11:42] &gt;&gt; we're people who are connected with the
[1:11:44] web.
[1:11:45] &gt;&gt; We're www. people. We're connected with
[1:11:49] the whole world. You sit in your office
[1:11:51] and you you you find out all kinds of
[1:11:54] things all over and talk to people and
[1:11:56] whatever more get questions answered.
[1:11:58] Whatever more God's talking about when
[1:12:01] Jesus said, "What will they do to a dry
[1:12:04] tree?" What will happen to people who
[1:12:07] have refused the green tree, the tree of
[1:12:10] life, and only take the tree of
[1:12:13] knowledge? What will happen friends? We
[1:12:15] don't want to be connected to that dry
[1:12:17] tree. We don't want these dead
[1:12:19] religions. I want no part of these dead
[1:12:22] religions. They can't be they can't bear
[1:12:24] my sin. I have that dry tree, the tree
[1:12:27] of life that took all of my frailties,
[1:12:30] and all of my uh wrongs and all of my
[1:12:34] mistakes and all of my sin and all of my
[1:12:36] iniquity and took it to hell and paid
[1:12:39] the price.
[1:12:41] &gt;&gt; And I want to give him praise,
[1:12:44] &gt;&gt; openly. Give him glory.
[1:12:46] &gt;&gt; No one could do that but him.
[1:12:49] &gt;&gt; He took the penalty upon himself
[1:12:52] &gt;&gt; and paid the price. Jesus paid it all.
[1:12:56] &gt;&gt; All to him I owe.
[1:12:58] &gt;&gt; Sin and left a crimson stain, but he
[1:13:02] washed it white as snow.
[1:13:04] [Music]
[1:13:06] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[1:13:10] &gt;&gt; What will he do? What will the just and
[1:13:12] holy God do?
[1:13:14] Why are you saying this, brother Bisl?
[1:13:16] Because you're rubbing shoulders with it
[1:13:18] every day. Amen.
[1:13:21] &gt;&gt; You may have the influence of it very
[1:13:23] near you, in your family, in your home.
[1:13:34] I was thinking of the conditions of the
[1:13:36] dry tree, the conditions of the world.
[1:13:40] In Satan's Eden,
[1:13:43] the prophet spoke and he said, "I wanted
[1:13:44] to speak to you something to bring
[1:13:46] something to enlighten you
[1:13:49] to the promise
[1:13:51] of God for this age.
[1:13:55] But I thought I would try to bring
[1:13:56] something to your mind with these
[1:13:59] scriptures I got written down
[1:14:02] that would enlighten you to know to make
[1:14:05] you a better soldier in the field that
[1:14:07] you're fighting in now. to learn the
[1:14:10] tactics of the enemy so that you can
[1:14:13] block everything before it gets to you.
[1:14:17] &gt;&gt; That's the main thing
[1:14:19] &gt;&gt; is to learn to keep the punches off you
[1:14:22] as much as possible.
[1:14:24] &gt;&gt; Listen, congregation Cloverdale Bible
[1:14:27] way and whoever hears this, what do you
[1:14:29] think that school building is standing
[1:14:30] there? Think that we're trying to make a
[1:14:32] name for ourselves? You think we're
[1:14:33] trying to make some presentation in the
[1:14:36] community? Not a bit.
[1:14:37] &gt;&gt; No. has to try to keep the punches off
[1:14:40] of our children.
[1:14:42] &gt;&gt; That's because we're trying to we we we
[1:14:45] read what Satan's tactics are.
[1:14:47] &gt;&gt; We studied him.
[1:14:49] &gt;&gt; We see what he's done through the
[1:14:51] schools. We see what he's done
[1:14:54] &gt;&gt; through the books, through the learning
[1:14:56] and all of these things. And we want not
[1:14:58] only no part of it, but it's up to us. I
[1:15:01] feel I feel compelled to protect the
[1:15:04] children and their minds
[1:15:07] and the purity of their minds from that
[1:15:09] thing. And God bless every mother and
[1:15:12] father that homeschools their children.
[1:15:14] I say, "God bless you."
[1:15:16] &gt;&gt; It's enough of this rotten sex.
[1:15:20] &gt;&gt; Why do they need to hear this when
[1:15:21] they're in grade one and grade two? Why
[1:15:24] do they need to read books that two two
[1:15:26] men are the same as a man and his wife?
[1:15:29] That's of the devil.
[1:15:31] that came from the pit. Or two women can
[1:15:34] be mother and father, not a chance. Not
[1:15:38] as long as we have a voice. And let your
[1:15:41] voice be heard.
[1:15:44] [Applause]
[1:15:46] &gt;&gt; That's not just a concrete building.
[1:15:48] That's to keep the punches off our
[1:15:50] children. And this church, every person
[1:15:52] ought to support it with everything that
[1:15:54] you have
[1:15:56] &gt;&gt; emotionally and financially in every
[1:15:58] which way.
[1:16:01] [Music]
[1:16:02] Do we want to see our children or see
[1:16:05] someone? I don't want to even see my
[1:16:07] enemy pay the penalty that Jesus had to
[1:16:10] pay.
[1:16:11] &gt;&gt; But if they do this in a green tree,
[1:16:13] what will they do in the dry?
[1:16:16] &gt;&gt; People going to trust their own mind.
[1:16:19] &gt;&gt; As in opposition to the into the
[1:16:22] messengers this kind of world that he
[1:16:24] came to.
[1:16:28] Amen.
[1:16:32] &gt;&gt; Now, let let us look at the great sinful
[1:16:34] day that we're now living in. I don't
[1:16:37] believe that there was ever a day that
[1:16:39] I've ever read in history.
[1:16:41] &gt;&gt; There's been greater days of
[1:16:43] persecution.
[1:16:47] when the children of God was put to
[1:16:49] death on every hand.
[1:16:55] &gt;&gt; But to see the de deceitfulness.
[1:16:59] &gt;&gt; Now here I want you to hang on to every
[1:17:01] word. But to see the deceitfulness of
[1:17:04] the enemy.
[1:17:07] We've never had a day like this
[1:17:10] like we're living in.
[1:17:13] It's the most cunning, deceitful day.
[1:17:18] Why am I emphasizing this? Because we
[1:17:21] need to have our senses sharpened.
[1:17:24] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:17:25] &gt;&gt; We need to become more aware.
[1:17:27] &gt;&gt; We need to allow our convictions to run
[1:17:30] deep
[1:17:31] &gt;&gt; and we need to be able to stand whether
[1:17:33] we say anything or not. We stand. Let
[1:17:36] people know I have no part of that.
[1:17:39] &gt;&gt; I'm not part of that. Amen.
[1:17:43] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:17:47] &gt;&gt; It's the most cunning and deceitful day.
[1:17:50] And when I see that, it brings this that
[1:17:53] the Christians has to be more on his toe
[1:17:57] today than ever was in any age. And I
[1:18:01] say to Cloverdale, Bible way, regardless
[1:18:04] of your position or where you are in
[1:18:06] life, we need to be more on our toes,
[1:18:09] not less on our toes, more alert,
[1:18:12] &gt;&gt; more conscious when we see things try to
[1:18:15] creep into your life or into your home
[1:18:17] or into the church. We we we have a we
[1:18:21] have a characteristic of resistance. I'm
[1:18:24] opposed to that. I don't have to strike
[1:18:27] and fight and war or whatever more. I'm
[1:18:30] opposed to that. I'm I'm withstanding
[1:18:32] that by my very life, by my very stature
[1:18:36] and posture.
[1:18:38] &gt;&gt; I am against that. Even my silence
[1:18:42] &gt;&gt; to things. My silence
[1:18:45] &gt;&gt; is in opposition to it.
[1:18:47] &gt;&gt; When they accuse Jesus, he remains
[1:18:50] silent.
[1:18:51] &gt;&gt; His silence condemned them.
[1:18:55] &gt;&gt; Sometimes it's not a war of words. It's
[1:18:58] just being silent. That's the hardest
[1:19:00] thing to do to be silent.
[1:19:02] &gt;&gt; And just to look.
[1:19:05] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:19:06] &gt;&gt; I remember once, I'll never forget it.
[1:19:11] Uh, you know, we never got into
[1:19:12] Halloween and all of those things, but
[1:19:14] this is before the message and my father
[1:19:17] was living staying with us. He was
[1:19:19] working for me and uh it was in Toronto
[1:19:24] and Halloween come and you know the
[1:19:26] girls wanted to go around and so they
[1:19:29] kind of dressed up in some simple little
[1:19:31] costume and
[1:19:33] and uh they were kind of running through
[1:19:36] the house and excited about going out is
[1:19:39] simple simple stuff but I saw my father
[1:19:42] look at them and I just saw the
[1:19:49] I won't say disregard but
[1:19:52] saw he I saw his disapproval all over
[1:19:57] his face. Never forgot it. I'm his only
[1:20:01] son. I just saw him look at them in
[1:20:04] total disapproval. He never said a word.
[1:20:06] Never said a word to me. Never said a
[1:20:07] word to them. I never forgot it. Did he
[1:20:10] preach me a message? Yep. Preached me a
[1:20:13] message. Was he still father to me?
[1:20:15] Yeah, he was father to me. Did he
[1:20:17] influence my life? Yeah, he influenced
[1:20:19] my life. Did he do his job? Yeah, he did
[1:20:21] his job. Never said a word.
[1:20:24] &gt;&gt; Here I am, 79 years old. I remember it
[1:20:26] to this day just exactly the way it all
[1:20:29] happened.
[1:20:30] &gt;&gt; And I knew right then he didn't approve
[1:20:32] of that. All right.
[1:20:38] The prophet said, uh,
[1:20:41] your birth here was pre-planned.
[1:20:44] &gt;&gt; So, what are we talking about? We're
[1:20:46] talking about the end time.
[1:20:49] God pre-planned you for this day.
[1:20:55] &gt;&gt; You're not an accident.
[1:20:57] &gt;&gt; You're not a myth. You're not somebody
[1:21:00] that just, you know, two man and a woman
[1:21:03] got together, a father and a mother, a
[1:21:05] husband and a wife, and decide, let's
[1:21:06] have some children. You're not the
[1:21:08] product of that desire.
[1:21:11] You that have become believers, you're
[1:21:13] the product of God's
[1:21:16] &gt;&gt; program.
[1:21:18] He's the one who determined you should
[1:21:19] come.
[1:21:23] &gt;&gt; You need to get there. You need to get
[1:21:24] to that point. I'm here by divine
[1:21:27] intervention.
[1:21:29] &gt;&gt; I'm here by a divine program.
[1:21:32] &gt;&gt; I am here on a commission.
[1:21:37] &gt;&gt; What are you here for?
[1:21:39] &gt;&gt; Just to make your way and struggle
[1:21:41] through life and, you know, rattle about
[1:21:43] this and rant about that and and
[1:21:46] complain about this and be happy about
[1:21:49] that. Is that what you're here for?
[1:21:52] &gt;&gt; No. Not believers.
[1:21:55] Amen.
[1:21:56] &gt;&gt; Not believers.
[1:22:00] &gt;&gt; You'll probably be happy when this
[1:22:01] service is over, but nevertheless,
[1:22:04] &gt;&gt; I'll leave you with some things to think
[1:22:05] about.
[1:22:10] &gt;&gt; You're pre-planned. I guess you believe
[1:22:12] that. Do you believe that?
[1:22:15] &gt;&gt; Every one of you knows that our birth
[1:22:18] was pre-planned. Did you know that your
[1:22:20] being here never originated just as a as
[1:22:24] at a myth or a thought? Everything was
[1:22:27] all pre-planned by God before the
[1:22:30] foundation of the world that you would
[1:22:34] be here.
[1:22:37] &gt;&gt; So, you're here and I'd like you all to
[1:22:39] agree with me on this. As much as I am
[1:22:43] called or any of these brothers are
[1:22:45] called, you are called.
[1:22:48] God has you here for a specific reason.
[1:22:52] &gt;&gt; I want you to go out of these doors
[1:22:53] today, say, "I was pre-planned by
[1:22:55] Almighty God
[1:22:57] &gt;&gt; to be here."
[1:22:58] &gt;&gt; And I've got more things to say about
[1:23:00] that as we go along.
[1:23:01] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:23:02] &gt;&gt; God also equipped you.
[1:23:04] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:23:05] &gt;&gt; For the day.
[1:23:06] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:23:07] &gt;&gt; He's not like a country that may send a
[1:23:09] soldier out and doesn't give doesn't I'm
[1:23:11] sorry, we don't have any guns or any
[1:23:12] bullets. No, he equipped you
[1:23:15] &gt;&gt; for this day. He equipped you
[1:23:19] The prophet also said there's two books
[1:23:22] that Satan really hates. He said while
[1:23:24] he hates the whole word of God but he
[1:23:27] hates Genesis and Revelations.
[1:23:29] &gt;&gt; Right?
[1:23:30] &gt;&gt; And of course this message is this
[1:23:32] message exposes him.
[1:23:34] &gt;&gt; He says but if anything he Satan
[1:23:37] despises mostly is Revelation in
[1:23:40] Genesis.
[1:23:40] &gt;&gt; Right? Remember this now because
[1:23:44] &gt;&gt; because Genesis tells his beginning
[1:23:48] &gt;&gt; and Revelation reveals what's going to
[1:23:50] happen to him in the last day.
[1:23:54] &gt;&gt; You think he's happy about this? He's
[1:23:56] not.
[1:23:57] &gt;&gt; He's roaring,
[1:23:59] &gt;&gt; ranting.
[1:24:01] &gt;&gt; Whether you hear it or not, it's not for
[1:24:03] your physical ears to hear or your
[1:24:05] physical eyes to see, but that's what's
[1:24:07] going on. And he's using the most
[1:24:10] cunning and every device and every
[1:24:11] deceiving thing to creep into our home,
[1:24:17] &gt;&gt; our life,
[1:24:18] &gt;&gt; our church,
[1:24:20] &gt;&gt; our whole society,
[1:24:22] &gt;&gt; our country,
[1:24:24] &gt;&gt; whatever more, whoever you identify
[1:24:26] with. And that is precisely why he
[1:24:29] inspires people to doubt the message.
[1:24:32] because by doing so he can conceal
[1:24:35] himself in their doubt.
[1:24:39] [Applause]
[1:24:41] &gt;&gt; I want to say that again.
[1:24:44] &gt;&gt; That is precisely why he hates this
[1:24:47] message.
[1:24:48] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:24:50] &gt;&gt; And why he inspires people to doubt the
[1:24:53] message because by doing so he can
[1:24:56] conceal himself
[1:24:58] &gt;&gt; in their doubt.
[1:25:00] Amen.
[1:25:02] &gt;&gt; There's no sin
[1:25:05] &gt;&gt; in not understanding something.
[1:25:08] &gt;&gt; I heard brother Brandon say the other
[1:25:09] day, he said, "I don't understand this."
[1:25:12] &gt;&gt; There's no requirement.
[1:25:15] &gt;&gt; There's nothing in the scripture that
[1:25:16] says, "And thou shalt understand all
[1:25:18] things."
[1:25:20] &gt;&gt; Jesus simply said, "Believest thou
[1:25:22] this."
[1:25:23] &gt;&gt; Do you believe this?
[1:25:26] &gt;&gt; I can tell you one thing. This message
[1:25:30] has found such a place
[1:25:32] &gt;&gt; within the human mind of religious
[1:25:36] people that it's impossible impossible
[1:25:40] to disregard it.
[1:25:41] &gt;&gt; Because I said to my wife driving here
[1:25:44] to this service, it was Jesus Christ
[1:25:46] when he was on earth. Both loved and
[1:25:49] hated.
[1:25:50] &gt;&gt; He was a good man, a good teacher, a
[1:25:52] good this, a good that. even wanted to
[1:25:55] make him king
[1:25:57] &gt;&gt; of the nation. That was the limits of
[1:26:00] their understanding. But when it came to
[1:26:02] crucify, crucify, they're out on the
[1:26:04] streets. Crucify him. Crucify him
[1:26:07] because there's no anchor there
[1:26:08] whatsoever. Were not born. Had no
[1:26:11] revelation that he was the word of God
[1:26:13] made flesh. Had no revelation that he's
[1:26:16] going to go to hell on their behalf.
[1:26:20] Amen.
[1:26:21] &gt;&gt; Oh,
[1:26:24] &gt;&gt; that just rocks me to my feet
[1:26:26] &gt;&gt; when I think of that.
[1:26:34] &gt;&gt; So, in in in a certain message, I'm
[1:26:37] going to read the dagot.
[1:26:41] Brother Brandon refers to the scriptures
[1:26:45] of Paul to Timothy.
[1:26:48] But understand this, we say in the last
[1:26:51] days perilous time shall come. But I
[1:26:54] like to read it from the dagot. Uh not
[1:26:56] the diagot rather, but the uh amplified
[1:26:59] version. But understand this that in the
[1:27:02] last days there will set in perilous
[1:27:05] times of great stress and trouble, hard
[1:27:10] to deal with and hard to bear. For
[1:27:14] people will be lovers of their self of
[1:27:16] self and utterly self-centered
[1:27:20] lovers of money and a and a and a
[1:27:23] aroused by an inordinate greedy desire
[1:27:26] for wealth. Proud and arrogant and
[1:27:31] contemptuous boasters. They will be
[1:27:34] abusive, blasphemous scoffers,
[1:27:37] disobedient to parents, ungrateful,
[1:27:40] unholy and profane. They will be without
[1:27:44] natural human affection, callous and
[1:27:48] inhuman. I didn't believe I would ever
[1:27:51] live to see the day where I could see
[1:27:53] men and women or women just up and leave
[1:27:57] their children.
[1:28:02] &gt;&gt; That may sound strange to you. I had an
[1:28:04] old house over here
[1:28:06] many years ago
[1:28:09] and it became a girl's house
[1:28:12] when God began to move upon the young
[1:28:14] people and I had a friend who was a
[1:28:16] carpenter and I took him through the old
[1:28:18] house and he he said better call in a
[1:28:21] bulldozer and just mow this thing down.
[1:28:24] And I felt in my heart because I could
[1:28:26] see God moving on the young people and
[1:28:28] there's young men on the streets and
[1:28:31] young ladies and they're getting saved.
[1:28:32] They're out of very dysfunctional homes
[1:28:34] and some of them were away from home
[1:28:36] because there was a lot of hippie and w
[1:28:39] and w w w w w w w w w w w w w w w w w w
[1:28:39] w w wand.
[1:28:41] So I thought, well, if God calls these
[1:28:43] people or calls any one of them, I'd
[1:28:45] have it. So I jacked it up and fixed it
[1:28:47] up and made a girl's home out of it. But
[1:28:50] prior to that, I was just letting people
[1:28:53] live in it at a very very low rent. And
[1:28:57] one day I got a phone call from a man
[1:29:00] and he said uh uh the family, he gave
[1:29:05] them my he gave them a name. He said uh
[1:29:07] you know that this family has left. I
[1:29:10] said, "No, I didn't know." And it had
[1:29:11] snowed and the wind was blowing
[1:29:14] and I want to describe it to you. And
[1:29:17] two of the boys went to school with my
[1:29:19] girls
[1:29:20] and they were in high school. I think
[1:29:23] one was in about grade 10. And so I went
[1:29:26] over to the house and I didn't have to
[1:29:29] push the door open. The door was open
[1:29:32] and snow had blown in. And you talk
[1:29:35] about a desolate. And I thought just
[1:29:37] think a family lived here. A man and his
[1:29:39] wife and about three boys lived in this
[1:29:42] house. And I I walked in. you can walk
[1:29:46] in with me. And there's the kitchen
[1:29:48] table and there's plates on the table
[1:29:52] that I could even tell you they had they
[1:29:54] had macaroni and meatballs or something
[1:29:57] cuz they were still dirty on the table.
[1:30:00] And I looked around. Here's the pictures
[1:30:02] of the family. Here's the mother with
[1:30:05] the children and and they're just gone.
[1:30:10] I've never seen them to this day.
[1:30:13] They're just gone.
[1:30:14] let those boys in school, two of them in
[1:30:17] school and those kids and this man told
[1:30:19] me, I don't know if you know, but those
[1:30:21] boys are sleeping there. There's no heat
[1:30:24] in the house. And and so he wanted me to
[1:30:27] try to do something. I walked over and I
[1:30:30] I just could not believe that those
[1:30:32] boys, two high school boys.
[1:30:36] These people are parents.
[1:30:38] This is a father.
[1:30:41] This is a mother.
[1:30:44] I'm not speaking friends of stories. I'm
[1:30:47] talking of experience.
[1:30:49] &gt;&gt; I'm talking about what God has said in
[1:30:52] his word. We're living in that day.
[1:30:55] &gt;&gt; People who are fathers, grandfathers,
[1:30:57] just gone. Not caring anything about
[1:31:00] seeing their children or their
[1:31:02] grandchildren or anybody else. Just
[1:31:04] gone.
[1:31:05] &gt;&gt; It just vacates them. I've
[1:31:08] &gt;&gt; seen children forget their parents, you
[1:31:10] know, put them away someplace and never
[1:31:13] go and see them again.
[1:31:14] &gt;&gt; I'll say to my kids that are here, don't
[1:31:16] you ever dare do that to me.
[1:31:21] I know they say no danger. I'll be on
[1:31:24] the phone. Hi, I need you.
[1:31:31] &gt;&gt; Is this all right? without natural or
[1:31:34] human affection.
[1:31:36] &gt;&gt; Just gone.
[1:31:41] &gt;&gt; And they'll be without natural or human
[1:31:43] affection, callous and inhuman,
[1:31:45] relentless, admitting of no truths or
[1:31:48] appeasement. They will be slanderers,
[1:31:51] false accusers, troublemakers,
[1:31:54] intemperate and loose in the morals and
[1:31:58] conduct, uncontrolled and fierce and
[1:32:01] haters of good. They will be treacherous
[1:32:04] betrayers, rash and inflated with
[1:32:07] self-conceit. They will be lovers of
[1:32:10] sensual pleasures and vain amusements
[1:32:14] more than and rather than lovers of God.
[1:32:18] And although they hold a form of piety,
[1:32:21] they'll go to church, they'll sing songs
[1:32:23] that you sang,
[1:32:25] &gt;&gt; they'll hold a book and hold a prayer
[1:32:27] book and whatever more. And although
[1:32:30] they hold a form of piety, true
[1:32:33] religion,
[1:32:35] that the form of true religion,
[1:32:38] they deny and reject and are strangers
[1:32:41] to the power of it. Their conduct belies
[1:32:44] the genuiness of their profession. Avoid
[1:32:48] avoid all such people.
[1:32:51] &gt;&gt; Turn away from them.
[1:32:57] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:32:59] &gt;&gt; God,
[1:33:00] &gt;&gt; are you listening? I have the quote
[1:33:02] here. God has not only pre-planned that
[1:33:06] you'd live here when these things exist,
[1:33:10] &gt;&gt; but he's empowered you to overcome them.
[1:33:14] &gt;&gt; He's empowered you to resist them. He's
[1:33:17] empowered you and given you knowledge so
[1:33:20] that you can understand what what's
[1:33:21] going on in the world.
[1:33:23] &gt;&gt; Listen to me, friends. Satan is in the
[1:33:26] average school. He's in the average
[1:33:28] church. He's in the average government.
[1:33:30] And the prophet said, "All governments,
[1:33:33] all education."
[1:33:36] &gt;&gt; Those are strong things to say. But the
[1:33:39] reason he's saying this is because that
[1:33:41] prophetic eye can see the enemy creeping
[1:33:44] in. He's in business.
[1:33:47] &gt;&gt; He's in He's in business. He's in your
[1:33:49] profession. He's in your workplace.
[1:33:52] &gt;&gt; He's in your computer.
[1:33:54] [Music]
[1:33:55] &gt;&gt; Come on. You might as well say, "Amen."
[1:33:57] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:33:58] &gt;&gt; Satan's in every computer.
[1:34:03] &gt;&gt; Do you think they would have used the
[1:34:05] web
[1:34:06] at a at a good purpose for their
[1:34:08] purposes back in the days of Jesus? Yes,
[1:34:12] they would have used it to full extent.
[1:34:15] and they would have said all kinds of
[1:34:16] things about them and you'd still be
[1:34:18] able to pull it up.
[1:34:21] &gt;&gt; And there's things that do you ever
[1:34:23] realize that it's not erased. It can't
[1:34:25] go any place.
[1:34:27] &gt;&gt; It's there. They put it up. That's the
[1:34:28] age that we're living in.
[1:34:30] &gt;&gt; But the prophet said, these are his
[1:34:33] words. I'll come to it. He said, "You've
[1:34:35] been pressurized for this age."
[1:34:39] &gt;&gt; And that I want you to agree with.
[1:34:42] &gt;&gt; And I want you to say it while you're
[1:34:43] sitting in your seat. I am pressurized
[1:34:46] for this age.
[1:34:48] &gt;&gt; I'm pressurized to resist it.
[1:34:55] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:34:58] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:35:04] &gt;&gt; The deception of this age is due to many
[1:35:08] cunning methods Satan uses.
[1:35:11] He presents anything that appeals to the
[1:35:14] senses of the fallen nature
[1:35:18] &gt;&gt; continuously
[1:35:19] and persistently.
[1:35:22] And I know that as you listen here, you
[1:35:25] may think that I'm going overboard. No,
[1:35:28] not any not any too much.
[1:35:31] Not any too much.
[1:35:33] We here behind this pulpit are not as
[1:35:36] relentless as Satan is
[1:35:40] &gt;&gt; in the world.
[1:35:42] &gt;&gt; He uses every possible means
[1:35:45] &gt;&gt; to get to your eyes, to get to your
[1:35:48] ears. And whether you like it or hate
[1:35:51] it, you'll hear it. You'll hear the
[1:35:53] thumping of the music in a restaurant
[1:35:56] where the food is nice because it's both
[1:35:58] good and evil.
[1:36:01] That's true.
[1:36:02] &gt;&gt; Why is all the fine spots, all you talk
[1:36:05] about beaches, say, "Oh my goodness, you
[1:36:08] went to a beach. I should be able to go
[1:36:10] to a beach without all the nakedness,
[1:36:14] &gt;&gt; without all the vile impurities, with
[1:36:16] all the I should be able to walk into a
[1:36:19] restaurant without the bars and all of
[1:36:22] this nonsense.
[1:36:24] We should be able to have it. Why should
[1:36:26] I have to live in the city where the
[1:36:28] where the uh gay community walk right up
[1:36:32] to the city hall, our new $130 million
[1:36:36] city hall and and insist on raising
[1:36:39] their flag with the flag of British
[1:36:42] Columbia and the flag of Canada. Can you
[1:36:44] believe that? You talk about that is the
[1:36:47] same spirit that is so brazen that would
[1:36:50] come to the tree of life himself and
[1:36:52] say, "Worship me.
[1:36:57] If you will worship me, I'll give you
[1:36:59] all this. But what's he saying? If
[1:37:02] you'll just worship me, I'll give you
[1:37:03] all this garbage.
[1:37:05] &gt;&gt; I'll give you all these kingdoms.
[1:37:07] They're going to fall anyway. Listen,
[1:37:08] friends, I'm preaching, you might as
[1:37:10] well say amen to it.
[1:37:15] &gt;&gt; And they will never forget being brazen
[1:37:17] because that's the spirit that's in
[1:37:19] them.
[1:37:20] to be brazen, to be proud, to make it a
[1:37:24] social a social standing in the
[1:37:26] community. They'll never make that
[1:37:28] unclean living comfortable for me.
[1:37:34] &gt;&gt; God has pressurized you. You better
[1:37:36] believe what this prophet said.
[1:37:39] &gt;&gt; God has pressurized you to this age.
[1:37:42] &gt;&gt; You don't have to fear it. You don't
[1:37:44] have to succumb to it.
[1:37:45] &gt;&gt; You don't have to give your ear to it.
[1:37:47] You don't have to give your eye to it.
[1:37:49] Amen.
[1:37:53] &gt;&gt; You've been made for another world
[1:37:55] &gt;&gt; and you've had a messenger come with a
[1:37:57] word that answers to your soul
[1:38:01] &gt;&gt; and that happens to be calling your name
[1:38:09] &gt;&gt; you just pray for me now.
[1:38:12] &gt;&gt; Endless voices of religion
[1:38:15] &gt;&gt; coarse language bizarre and outlandish.
[1:38:19] I I will get over this in just a moment.
[1:38:24] Outlandish.
[1:38:27] My wife and I, we we're told by our
[1:38:30] medical people, by the doctor, do you
[1:38:32] exercise? Do you exercise? Do you
[1:38:33] exercise? I hear that all the time. Do
[1:38:35] you exercise? And we say, well, we walk.
[1:38:40] So, we try to walk.
[1:38:43] And even even a little simple prominad
[1:38:46] in white rock,
[1:38:48] my wife says to me every once in a while
[1:38:50] said it just the other day, you can wear
[1:38:52] anything. I said, yeah, you don't have
[1:38:55] to wear anything.
[1:38:57] You can wear anything.
[1:38:59] He says, it's absolutely bizarre. Kinky,
[1:39:02] beyond kinky,
[1:39:05] insane. I said, no, they've just turned
[1:39:07] River, they just opened the doors of
[1:39:08] Riverview Institution. You know, we
[1:39:10] don't have an ins insane institution.
[1:39:13] You folks on the US side, you might have
[1:39:14] one. We don't have one. Canada just
[1:39:16] opened all the doors and let all the
[1:39:18] people out. And here a prophet said
[1:39:20] years ago, and I didn't understand what
[1:39:21] he said years ago, he said the streets
[1:39:23] would be full of insan insanity.
[1:39:28] &gt;&gt; We don't have Riverview. Riverview. I've
[1:39:30] been in Riverview.
[1:39:32] I've sat I've sat with I've sat with the
[1:39:34] doctors in Riverview over over a young
[1:39:36] man who was delivered and they were
[1:39:38] trying to find out, you know, with their
[1:39:40] mind what happened to him.
[1:39:42] He said, "What do you do? What do you do
[1:39:44] with your medication?" He said, "Well,
[1:39:47] I flushed it down the toilet." "Oh," he
[1:39:50] said, just in his quiet still voice.
[1:39:52] "Oh, you flushed it down the toilet."
[1:39:54] "Yes."
[1:39:57] He asked me,
[1:39:59] "What did we do with this young man that
[1:40:02] made such a change in five weeks?"
[1:40:05] So we we didn't do anything. We prayed
[1:40:07] for him.
[1:40:09] &gt;&gt; I said, "He worked in the garden." He
[1:40:11] was trying to figure out what what
[1:40:14] brought such a change to him. Totally
[1:40:17] demonpossessed young man had been. And
[1:40:20] then he sat there free. You know who I
[1:40:22] speak of.
[1:40:27] So
[1:40:29] he said,
[1:40:33] "Mr. Biscll, do you believe in
[1:40:35] exorcism?"
[1:40:37] Well, I know what exorcism is, casting
[1:40:39] out of devils. And so I wanted to play
[1:40:42] ignorant. I said, "What does that mean?"
[1:40:46] He said, "Well, it is it is the practice
[1:40:49] of casting out of devils." I said,
[1:40:53] 'Well, as Jesus practiced it, I believe
[1:40:56] in it.
[1:40:58] All right. Well, that didn't answer his
[1:41:01] question. So, he went on to another one.
[1:41:03] Do you believe in something else? And I
[1:41:06] do you believe in, you know, you can do
[1:41:08] this? And I said, well, as Jesus taught
[1:41:10] it and told us, I believe it. And then
[1:41:12] he asked a third question. I just went
[1:41:14] back, put my back against the Bible.
[1:41:17] Well, as Jesus said it,
[1:41:19] &gt;&gt; I believe it. Right. Amen.
[1:41:21] &gt;&gt; And I said, "Listen, doctor,"
[1:41:24] I said, "I'm sorry. I I I don't want to,
[1:41:27] you know, play games with you, but I
[1:41:31] said, if you want to know what I
[1:41:33] believe, I believe that all mental
[1:41:36] illness is first a spiritual illness."
[1:41:40] And he he just let down all the guard.
[1:41:41] He says, "Well," he says, "I tend to
[1:41:44] agree with you."
[1:41:47] So there's a psychologist in the insane
[1:41:49] asylum saying that all everything in
[1:41:52] there was really a spiritual problem.
[1:41:53] Why don't they deal with the spiritual
[1:41:55] problem if they feel that was what it
[1:41:57] was?
[1:42:00] &gt;&gt; Are you with me? Amen. Amen.
[1:42:08] &gt;&gt; He also received the deception of the
[1:42:11] cares and the and uh that are made
[1:42:15] superior to God. He also that receiveth
[1:42:17] seed among the thorns is that heareth
[1:42:20] the word and carth and the care of this
[1:42:23] world and the deceitfulness of riches
[1:42:25] choke the word and he becometh
[1:42:29] unfruitful.
[1:42:34] &gt;&gt; And just before I go to some slides and
[1:42:35] we'll read some things together. Are you
[1:42:38] not too weary?
[1:42:42] &gt;&gt; If thou hast run, this is in Jeremiah
[1:42:44] 12:5. If thou hast run with the footmen,
[1:42:48] and they have wearied thee,
[1:42:51] then how canst thou contend with the
[1:42:54] horses?
[1:42:56] And if in the land of peace, wherein
[1:42:58] thou trust us,
[1:43:01] you're living in a land of peace.
[1:43:06] And if in the land of peace, wherein
[1:43:09] thou trustest,
[1:43:11] they wearied thee.
[1:43:14] Now don't look at me and say I'm not
[1:43:16] weary. I hear from so many. I hear it in
[1:43:19] my own home. We get weary.
[1:43:23] You get weary.
[1:43:25] &gt;&gt; Life is wearing.
[1:43:27] &gt;&gt; I would say on probably 100% of the
[1:43:31] people here that are adult, life is
[1:43:35] weary.
[1:43:39] And if in a land of peace,
[1:43:43] wherein thou trustest,
[1:43:46] they weary they, then how wilt thou do
[1:43:50] in the swelling of Jordan?
[1:43:53] &gt;&gt; How will thou do
[1:43:56] when Jordan rolls in?
[1:43:58] &gt;&gt; In the end thereof,
[1:44:00] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:44:06] In the for forgotten biatitude,
[1:44:09] brother Brandham talks about John the
[1:44:11] Baptist and he said, "John,
[1:44:16] well, I have this on slide, so I'll if
[1:44:19] you'll just dim the lights a wee bit,
[1:44:21] please."
[1:44:27] John the Baptist, it thought, well, now
[1:44:28] I introduced a Messiah,
[1:44:31] that he had his fan in his hand, and he
[1:44:34] was going to purge the floors and take
[1:44:37] his wheat into the garner. And I told
[1:44:40] him that the axe was laid to the root of
[1:44:42] the tree, and he was going to take all
[1:44:44] the trash and burn it up. And here he
[1:44:48] is, instead of great mighty man like
[1:44:50] that, here he comes, meek and lowly.
[1:44:54] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:44:58] Something must have went wrong
[1:44:59] somewhere. He said, "There's no doubt,
[1:45:02] but something's wrong somewhere." He
[1:45:06] thought it isn't right. He became
[1:45:08] dismayed
[1:45:10] like many of us do. When we see things
[1:45:14] going on that isn't what we think is
[1:45:17] just right, we become dismayed.
[1:45:22] &gt;&gt; We've all been there.
[1:45:25] said,
[1:45:26] &gt;&gt; "And you may well be there this
[1:45:28] morning." And he goes on to say, "Don't
[1:45:31] be weary."
[1:45:32] [Music]
[1:45:34] &gt;&gt; It will be all right.
[1:45:40] &gt;&gt; I thank God
[1:45:42] &gt;&gt; for that kind of word.
[1:45:45] &gt;&gt; Don't be weary.
[1:45:49] &gt;&gt; It'll be all right.
[1:45:52] &gt;&gt; That's the God that we have. Yeah.
[1:45:54] &gt;&gt; So, well, you don't know what I'm going
[1:45:56] through. Yes, God knows what you're
[1:45:58] going through.
[1:45:59] &gt;&gt; If I don't know what you're going
[1:46:00] through, God knows what you're going
[1:46:02] through. God knows all about that thing
[1:46:04] because he's he knows that his arch
[1:46:07] enemy has permeated the entire
[1:46:10] civilization.
[1:46:11] &gt;&gt; More so, this is the end time, friends.
[1:46:14] &gt;&gt; This is the end time.
[1:46:16] &gt;&gt; Don't think we're not we're going to be
[1:46:18] there with without we're going to be
[1:46:19] here without a battle. We're going to
[1:46:21] have battles,
[1:46:22] &gt;&gt; but we're pressurized for this age.
[1:46:26] &gt;&gt; We're pressurized to withstand anything
[1:46:29] that comes.
[1:46:30] &gt;&gt; But you have to be able to resist it.
[1:46:32] You have to resist it.
[1:46:42] And I felt
[1:46:44] I felt led of the Holy Spirit
[1:46:48] to relate to them experiences. I know
[1:46:50] that they came to speak their heart, but
[1:46:54] instead I poured out my heart and they
[1:46:56] will understand more after this service.
[1:47:01] And I I felt that I I felt led to tell
[1:47:03] them of the opportunities, the great
[1:47:06] opportunities that Satan presented. Oh,
[1:47:10] it was so glamorous. It was so
[1:47:13] rewarding. It was Was there anything
[1:47:15] sinful? No, nothing sinful. It was just
[1:47:18] a such success and things and at that
[1:47:21] time and one night can't even sleep all
[1:47:24] night more than people would make in a
[1:47:27] lifetime was hanging right there already
[1:47:31] accepted. And I couldn't sleep.
[1:47:34] And in the morning I said, "Call them
[1:47:38] and tell them no, I won't do it. I can't
[1:47:42] do it." And first and foremost, I would
[1:47:44] have to leave the church for a year. I
[1:47:47] wasn't prepared to do that.
[1:47:49] Friends, sometimes the the the the most
[1:47:53] glorious thing that is presented to you,
[1:47:58] &gt;&gt; whether it be in business, whether it be
[1:48:00] in sports, whether it be in beauty, or
[1:48:03] whether it be in talents, I'm not here
[1:48:06] to be boastful at all. I'm just here to
[1:48:08] tell you the truth. If I pass away
[1:48:11] tonight or tomorrow and gone, at least
[1:48:13] I'll have this message off my heart.
[1:48:17] &gt;&gt; My daughter sang
[1:48:19] And they sang a song that I first picked
[1:48:22] up from down someone sang it at
[1:48:24] Jeffersonville.
[1:48:25] It is I be not afraid.
[1:48:28] And it it was it was rhythmic
[1:48:31] song, footapping song. Oh, it is I be
[1:48:36] not afraid. This is the reply that the
[1:48:39] master gave and I thought, you know, and
[1:48:41] they were just singing it with all their
[1:48:44] energy of their youth and so on so
[1:48:45] forth. the director that was one of the
[1:48:48] big studios downtown and the director
[1:48:50] was the director of the choir of the
[1:48:53] large Pentecostal church downtown and he
[1:48:56] says he says put that in my hands and
[1:49:00] I'll put them on the top 10 of gospel
[1:49:02] music and I answered immediately I said
[1:49:05] that's precisely what we don't want
[1:49:11] &gt;&gt; there's time to say no
[1:49:14] Amen.
[1:49:19] &gt;&gt; To this congregation, you will have
[1:49:22] opportunities.
[1:49:24] &gt;&gt; Your children will have opportunities.
[1:49:27] And as fathers, as parents, there's
[1:49:30] times when we have to put on the brakes
[1:49:33] &gt;&gt; and say, "No, that is not the direction.
[1:49:36] That happens to be the world. And I do
[1:49:39] not want Satan to get an advantage
[1:49:41] within this home, within this structure
[1:49:45] &gt;&gt; through their through their their super
[1:49:48] intelligence or their super ability or
[1:49:50] their super skill or anything else.
[1:49:54] &gt;&gt; You may be glad to see me get out of
[1:49:56] this pulpit, but I've got to let it all
[1:49:58] out.
[1:49:59] &gt;&gt; Do you support it?
[1:50:01] &gt;&gt; You understand it? I'm preaching for
[1:50:03] your benefit.
[1:50:06] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[1:50:08] &gt;&gt; Lord
[1:50:08] &gt;&gt; in the message shalom. Peace. Don't be
[1:50:12] weary.
[1:50:13] &gt;&gt; This is to you, friend. Shalom.
[1:50:16] &gt;&gt; Don't be weary. Why? He says Jesus is
[1:50:20] here.
[1:50:21] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Not some figment of your
[1:50:23] imagination. Jesus is here.
[1:50:26] &gt;&gt; The word is here.
[1:50:28] &gt;&gt; The answer's here.
[1:50:29] &gt;&gt; Don't go stumbling off your own
[1:50:31] direction in the shadows and in the
[1:50:33] darkness when the light is here. Jesus
[1:50:36] is here. The word is here. The
[1:50:39] revelation of him is here. His voice is
[1:50:41] here. You can hear it. You have the
[1:50:44] advantage of hearing it.
[1:50:46] &gt;&gt; You have the privilege of hearing it.
[1:50:49] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[1:50:52] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord Jesus.
[1:50:58] &gt;&gt; His great light has come to us and we're
[1:51:01] thankful for it.
[1:51:02] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:51:04] his word, the great mystery. Here he is
[1:51:08] today manifesting himself,
[1:51:11] doing the same as he did then. You might
[1:51:13] say, "Well, I don't see him manifesting
[1:51:15] himself." Open your eyes. Here we are.
[1:51:19] [Music]
[1:51:20] &gt;&gt; I stand here as a witness today and I'm
[1:51:22] unashshamed of the witness of Jesus
[1:51:25] Christ. Even though there's all kinds of
[1:51:27] opportunities in the world and whether
[1:51:30] it be whether it be women or whether it
[1:51:32] be men or whether it be whatever it is,
[1:51:35] God give a conviction inside for you and
[1:51:38] for me and for believers of this word.
[1:51:41] We we have a sharpened conviction
[1:51:43] inside. And that there's a time to say
[1:51:46] yes. I yield. And there's a time to say
[1:51:49] no.
[1:51:51] &gt;&gt; That's going to cost me too much. that's
[1:51:54] going to cost me spiritually. I'm going
[1:51:56] to say no.
[1:51:58] &gt;&gt; Don't be afraid. God will stand behind
[1:52:00] that.
[1:52:03] &gt;&gt; Go as far as you can. Get all the
[1:52:05] education you can. Get all the money you
[1:52:07] can. Give all you can. Do all you can
[1:52:09] for the kingdom of God. But one thing
[1:52:11] for sure, let your life be completely
[1:52:14] surrendered to God. Amen.
[1:52:18] &gt;&gt; I see some of you young ladies and maybe
[1:52:20] you've passed the pass through your mind
[1:52:23] think, "Oh, if I could only find Mr.
[1:52:25] Per," you won't find him.
[1:52:28] If I could only find him the right
[1:52:30] person, all my problems would be solved.
[1:52:33] Well, I'm here to tell you, no, all your
[1:52:36] problems just start.
[1:52:40] Not really. I've had a wonderful
[1:52:42] marriage, but
[1:52:44] they say they've been made in heaven,
[1:52:46] but there's a lot of work to do on
[1:52:47] earth.
[1:52:53] &gt;&gt; Do we still have a few more minutes,
[1:52:54] please?
[1:52:57] Now, I need your full attention just
[1:52:59] starting now.
[1:53:03] We are going to the message and I'm
[1:53:05] going to go through it by sequence
[1:53:09] and you're going to read with me parts
[1:53:11] of it which is the present stage of my
[1:53:14] ministry. Now don't forget it's
[1:53:15] prophetic.
[1:53:17] &gt;&gt; It's prophetic
[1:53:20] and and and he took it in such a way he
[1:53:22] said being very tired and worn
[1:53:27] of himself down the east coast and also
[1:53:30] up the west coast. If you notice the
[1:53:31] time, it's 1962, the 9th, which would be
[1:53:34] September. And he's just been with us in
[1:53:37] Victoria and over in Port Alurnie and
[1:53:41] with the native Indian people up the
[1:53:42] west coast into Canada and with the fine
[1:53:45] cooperation of all the different
[1:53:46] denominational churches. That was
[1:53:48] absolutely true. organizations which
[1:53:52] cooperated not just in those meetings
[1:53:54] but in that whole tour having great
[1:53:56] meetings had great success as far as
[1:53:59] could be called success today and
[1:54:02] perhaps maybe uh many would call it
[1:54:05] great but myself I'm a revivalist
[1:54:10] and the revival nationally speaking is
[1:54:14] just about ended so now you'll get the
[1:54:17] thought
[1:54:22] and now
[1:54:25] this is to the many peoples and friends
[1:54:28] of mine around the world I wish to state
[1:54:31] tonight here in the tabernacle
[1:54:33] people are packed in all around stand
[1:54:37] indoors and outside in their cars and
[1:54:41] things he's got the church is packed if
[1:54:44] he's not speaking to a handful of people
[1:54:46] the church is packed and all right, but
[1:54:48] nevertheless, this is what he's getting
[1:54:50] across to us. Regardless of whether the
[1:54:52] church is packed,
[1:54:55] but I've come to this place that I want
[1:54:59] to explain
[1:55:01] what stage of time
[1:55:04] &gt;&gt; we're living in
[1:55:05] &gt;&gt; according to the ministry that the Lord
[1:55:08] give me.
[1:55:10] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:55:10] &gt;&gt; And you're here under that.
[1:55:14] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:55:15] You're here under that ministry.
[1:55:17] &gt;&gt; You're product of that.
[1:55:19] &gt;&gt; That's why you're here. And so he says,
[1:55:22] I've come now to a place they want to
[1:55:23] explain. He wants to explain to you what
[1:55:28] you're experiencing and why we
[1:55:31] experience these things. And I wanted to
[1:55:34] record it from the tabernacle to come on
[1:55:36] my heart last spring, but I waited till
[1:55:39] I got back here so I could give uh get a
[1:55:42] recording of it and sent to the people
[1:55:45] of the world.
[1:55:48] He reads a scripture and I'm reading
[1:55:50] this scripture. We are in the stage of
[1:55:52] time and must be in the spirit of the
[1:55:55] world.
[1:55:57] He takes a scripture. I re I I charge
[1:55:59] thee therefore before God in the Lord
[1:56:01] Jesus Christ who shall
[1:56:04] judge the quicken the dead at his
[1:56:05] appearing. Preach the word be instant in
[1:56:08] season out of season. Reprove, rebuke,
[1:56:11] rebuke, exhort with all longsuffering
[1:56:14] and doctrine. For the time will come
[1:56:16] when they will not for the time will
[1:56:18] come when they will not endure sound
[1:56:22] doctrine.
[1:56:24] Say within your own self, by God's
[1:56:26] grace, I will not be part of that
[1:56:27] number.
[1:56:31] &gt;&gt; For the time will come. Why? Because of
[1:56:34] the age, because of the infiltration,
[1:56:38] &gt;&gt; because of the attack of the enemy,
[1:56:40] because of the invasion of darkness,
[1:56:43] &gt;&gt; yes,
[1:56:43] &gt;&gt; that will take place. For the time will
[1:56:45] come when they will not endure sound
[1:56:47] doctrine, but after their own lusts or
[1:56:49] desires shall heap to themselves
[1:56:52] teachers having itching ears, and they
[1:56:55] shall turn away their ears from the
[1:56:57] truth.
[1:56:58] &gt;&gt; They shall turn away their ears from
[1:57:00] people. We don't have to turn our ears
[1:57:02] away. We have to turn our ears towards
[1:57:05] the truth. Say, I'm here to hear that.
[1:57:09] &gt;&gt; And and shall be turned unto fables. But
[1:57:13] watch thou in all things. Endure
[1:57:15] afflictions. Do the work of an
[1:57:17] evangelist. Make full proof of thy
[1:57:20] ministry. And he said that fifth verse
[1:57:22] was a verse he always had stopped and
[1:57:24] that they'll be turned under fables. But
[1:57:26] he said now he felt inclined and felt
[1:57:29] urged to go to the fifth verse. But
[1:57:31] watch thou in all things endure
[1:57:33] afflictions and do the work of an
[1:57:35] evangelist. Make full proof of thy
[1:57:38] ministry. He said and and
[1:57:44] we live here now in three dimensions,
[1:57:49] light, matter and time and our five
[1:57:52] senses contact
[1:57:55] them dimensions.
[1:57:58] But we have contact
[1:58:00] through science, the fourth dimension,
[1:58:06] because coming right through the
[1:58:08] building now comes pictures, voices of
[1:58:11] radio, pictures of television, but our
[1:58:14] senses does not contact that.
[1:58:17] &gt;&gt; But yet they have a tube. I have a
[1:58:19] reason for saying this, friends. So stay
[1:58:21] with it, please. That picks up those
[1:58:23] other waves and manifests them. So all
[1:58:26] of these voices that are going through
[1:58:28] here, we have instruments or devices
[1:58:30] that will pick that up. I have a a cell
[1:58:33] phone. It'll pick up. They don't want me
[1:58:35] to have it here because it it messes up
[1:58:37] the sound. And he says, but and manifest
[1:58:41] them. They're here. We know it. They're
[1:58:44] absolutely truth. It proves to us that
[1:58:47] there is a fourth dimension.
[1:58:50] Now the fifth dimension
[1:58:52] is where the sinner
[1:58:54] &gt;&gt; the unbeliever dies and goes.
[1:58:58] &gt;&gt; And when a Christian dies he goes into
[1:59:01] the sixth dimension
[1:59:03] &gt;&gt; and God is in the seventh dimension.
[1:59:07] &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham at this point he just
[1:59:09] goes into some detail. I'm going to just
[1:59:11] rehearse it quickly. He saw a
[1:59:14] documentary or something on on I believe
[1:59:16] it was a television program or
[1:59:18] something. He saw this and it was of a
[1:59:22] deep sea uh submarine went way way deep
[1:59:27] into the ocean. And uh he said they saw
[1:59:31] really unusual and very hideous kind of
[1:59:34] sea life. And one was a fish that had no
[1:59:38] eyes.
[1:59:39] And and he said he had a sense with some
[1:59:42] kind of a sauna or something where he he
[1:59:44] could sense and get his food. And but he
[1:59:48] had no eyes. And he says, "And I thought
[1:59:52] that this fish that had no eyes." And he
[1:59:56] says, "But they were guided by another
[1:59:58] sense so they could contact their food."
[2:00:02] And he said, "I thought I thought then,
[2:00:04] oh, if if I could only guide that little
[2:00:08] fish, if I could just guide him, if I
[2:00:10] could if I could direct him, if he could
[2:00:13] have my eyes, if he could see like I
[2:00:16] see." And uh he said, "If I could have
[2:00:19] control of that little fish with my
[2:00:21] sight, how much greater could I supply
[2:00:24] his food and lead him places? How much
[2:00:28] greater my sight is than his radar? He
[2:00:32] contacts. He says, "And then and then it
[2:00:36] came to me."
[2:00:39] And then it came to me. If I could only
[2:00:41] surrender myself to God,
[2:00:44] &gt;&gt; how much greater is the sight and senses
[2:00:46] of God?
[2:00:47] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:00:48] &gt;&gt; Who could guide us much more than the
[2:00:50] things that we see.
[2:00:52] &gt;&gt; Amen. Because the faith that he supplies
[2:00:55] supplies us is the evidence of things
[2:00:58] not seen with our eyes. Then if that
[2:01:01] little fish could never come up then if
[2:01:04] that little fish could never come up to
[2:01:06] the top of the water like other fish
[2:01:09] because he's pressurized. Said if he did
[2:01:11] it explode but he said he's pressurized
[2:01:15] no more than we can go up higher and
[2:01:17] keep from exploding. We are pressurized
[2:01:21] for the place that we live in.
[2:01:27] &gt;&gt; Right?
[2:01:28] &gt;&gt; And everybody
[2:01:30] wants to be in agreement with that.
[2:01:34] &gt;&gt; Go out this door. Don't succumb.
[2:01:37] &gt;&gt; Don't feel weary.
[2:01:39] &gt;&gt; Well, I just can't stand it. Put your
[2:01:42] shoulders back. So, I'm a believer.
[2:01:45] &gt;&gt; God has sent me his own personal voice.
[2:01:48] It is answer to my soul.
[2:01:51] &gt;&gt; This isn't something that's just good in
[2:01:53] church, friends.
[2:01:54] &gt;&gt; I don't want this just to be a church
[2:01:56] service.
[2:01:57] &gt;&gt; We're pressurized for the place that we
[2:02:00] live in.
[2:02:00] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:02:04] &gt;&gt; But now, if that little fish
[2:02:07] could ever come up here and be and be
[2:02:11] me,
[2:02:12] would he ever want to be that little
[2:02:14] fish again down in the midnight of
[2:02:16] blackness?
[2:02:18] He'd never want to be a fish no more
[2:02:21] because he's something greater than a
[2:02:23] fish. He's a man. His senses are
[2:02:26] greater. His understanding is greater.
[2:02:28] His intelligent is supreme. Then
[2:02:32] multiply that by 10 million.
[2:02:35] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:02:36] &gt;&gt; Then you get what it is when you pass
[2:02:39] from this into the presence of God
[2:02:42] yonder. where the human being is so much
[2:02:45] farther than what we are here. You'd
[2:02:49] never want to be a human being like this
[2:02:52] no more down in this pest house of
[2:02:55] sickness and corruption.
[2:02:58] &gt;&gt; And I'm sure something down within you
[2:03:00] is saying that is true. Oh God, there is
[2:03:04] a place, there is a land.
[2:03:06] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:03:06] &gt;&gt; There is something. And that's why we
[2:03:08] live this life.
[2:03:10] &gt;&gt; That's why we fight these battles.
[2:03:12] &gt;&gt; Glory.
[2:03:14] Hallelujah.
[2:03:16] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:03:16] &gt;&gt; Praise God.
[2:03:27] &gt;&gt; And this 1962
[2:03:29] now friends, I have an advantage that
[2:03:31] I'm trying to pass off to you. I was
[2:03:34] with him just after the experience of
[2:03:36] beyond the curtain of time. And now he
[2:03:39] refers he relates to it
[2:03:44] beyond the curtain of time. He doesn't
[2:03:47] tell the account here but he just said
[2:03:49] when I seen that place
[2:03:53] and that condition
[2:03:55] and those people the condition those
[2:03:58] people were in and how beyond anything
[2:04:01] that this world could ever think of it
[2:04:04] was glorious.
[2:04:07] There could not be sin there.
[2:04:10] &gt;&gt; No death or nothing could ever enter
[2:04:12] that spot.
[2:04:15] &gt;&gt; Listen friends, I hope that I'm able to
[2:04:18] get this across to you. Churches in the
[2:04:20] land are filled.
[2:04:23] Go to any funeral home you wish to go
[2:04:25] to. They want to put that person that's
[2:04:28] laying there or their ashes are there.
[2:04:30] They want to put them in a glorious
[2:04:32] heavenly place.
[2:04:35] That is how successful Satan has gotten.
[2:04:39] When that individual
[2:04:43] hated anything that was pure, hated
[2:04:46] godliness, hated the Bible, maybe didn't
[2:04:49] say they hated the Bible, didn't have
[2:04:51] any time for it, didn't read it, didn't
[2:04:54] talk to God, wasn't interested in God.
[2:04:57] But then some person will get there,
[2:04:59] wave some metal, burn some incense, and
[2:05:02] want to put that person up in heaven.
[2:05:05] They didn't want it down here. What are
[2:05:07] they doing putting them up there?
[2:05:08] Somebody's telling a lie.
[2:05:11] &gt;&gt; Somebody's not being truthful. Amen.
[2:05:19] &gt;&gt; When you see a 100,000 people and you
[2:05:22] see a man come out in a frock and put up
[2:05:26] a couple fingers and say some things
[2:05:28] about peace, anybody could say it.
[2:05:32] &gt;&gt; You know, we we should be at peace and
[2:05:35] you know, may the world have peace and
[2:05:37] all of these things and all those
[2:05:39] people, what what what do they think?
[2:05:41] And then a man is is able to say these
[2:05:44] kind of things, say more in one
[2:05:46] paragraph than most people say in their
[2:05:48] lifetime and can't get the ear of the
[2:05:51] people, then you know how successful
[2:05:53] Satan has been at blinding the people
[2:05:56] and dulling their hearing.
[2:05:59] And it should behoove us when two men on
[2:06:02] the way to Emmas who were believers
[2:06:05] &gt;&gt; and were considering and and reasoning
[2:06:07] about these things and women from their
[2:06:10] church had had a vision had been to the
[2:06:12] sephiler and seen all these things and
[2:06:15] we've been preaching about it. I'm still
[2:06:16] on the subject of two worlds. This is a
[2:06:19] voice from another world.
[2:06:21] &gt;&gt; And I sat I sat with this man
[2:06:24] &gt;&gt; on the hillside. You've heard me say it.
[2:06:27] and he just looked down this magnificent
[2:06:29] Rocky Mountain trench with beautiful
[2:06:32] animals down below and and flowers and
[2:06:36] grass and little willows and just looked
[2:06:39] down this great vast valley said you
[2:06:42] know brother Eddie on the other side
[2:06:45] &gt;&gt; it's just very much like this
[2:06:49] &gt;&gt; and one day he said when you get over
[2:06:51] there
[2:06:52] &gt;&gt; you'll find little paths
[2:06:54] &gt;&gt; you walk down one of those paths and one
[2:06:57] of One of one day you'll find me.
[2:06:59] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:07:02] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:07:02] &gt;&gt; If you can't find me when you get over,
[2:07:05] I might just be walking down one of
[2:07:07] those trails.
[2:07:08] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:07:09] &gt;&gt; Say, "Oh, that's just a figment of
[2:07:11] imagination. I'd sooner live in that one
[2:07:13] than live in this one.
[2:07:15] &gt;&gt; I'd sooner live in the faith and the
[2:07:17] hope that these words and this Bible is
[2:07:20] true." And the apostle Paul, oh my, in
[2:07:24] the present stage of my ministry, the
[2:07:27] prophet talks about Deeus and how he
[2:07:29] left Paul. And he said, Paul is writing
[2:07:31] to Timothy and he's saying, you know,
[2:07:34] bring my coat and and all all have
[2:07:36] forsaken me.
[2:07:38] &gt;&gt; All have forsaken Paul.
[2:07:42] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. Right.
[2:07:46] &gt;&gt; Paul
[2:07:49] &gt;&gt; who met the pillar of fire.
[2:07:51] &gt;&gt; Paul
[2:07:53] &gt;&gt; and brother Brandham is so kind. He said
[2:07:55] Deus Deus was a a nice man.
[2:07:59] &gt;&gt; He said Deus
[2:08:01] was probably a good preacher.
[2:08:04] &gt;&gt; Deeus was a good friend.
[2:08:07] &gt;&gt; But he said he misunderstood
[2:08:09] &gt;&gt; Paul.
[2:08:11] He had the wrong opinion of Paul
[2:08:14] &gt;&gt; because he saw Paul as as as a had great
[2:08:19] had a great potential, a great ministry,
[2:08:21] but he's in jail.
[2:08:24] &gt;&gt; And now he's he's even asking for his
[2:08:26] coat. He's only got one coat.
[2:08:29] &gt;&gt; He could have been a success. He mixed
[2:08:32] he mingled soldier shoulders with
[2:08:34] millionaires. But there he is in in
[2:08:36] prison. And he said, "All have forsaken
[2:08:40] me." and they had
[2:08:43] &gt;&gt; come on
[2:08:43] &gt;&gt; and he's going to influence and we read
[2:08:46] his letters but I wonder friends I don't
[2:08:48] want us to be hypocritical that we would
[2:08:50] read his letters and be affected by his
[2:08:53] letters and yet yet if we had to put
[2:08:55] ourselves back there would we be
[2:08:57] standing with Paul or would we be with
[2:08:59] somebody else
[2:09:03] [Music]
[2:09:04] &gt;&gt; I'm being kind of blunt and I
[2:09:08] [Music]
[2:09:10] What's the use of having a a a faith or
[2:09:12] a a and putting forth an image here that
[2:09:15] we are a certain something, but if we
[2:09:18] live back there, we're not.
[2:09:20] &gt;&gt; I want to see ourselves as someone who'd
[2:09:23] be standing not on the side of the path,
[2:09:25] but standing with Jesus Christ, standing
[2:09:28] with the apostles, standing with those
[2:09:31] that are whatever they were called,
[2:09:33] fanatics
[2:09:35] &gt;&gt; or and that's what the prophet said. Oh,
[2:09:37] they don't want any of these tongue
[2:09:39] speaking, crying, shouting Pentecostal
[2:09:43] or or book of Acts people. He said Acts
[2:09:46] 2:38 people. He doesn't want any of
[2:09:48] them. Said make the church look like it
[2:09:51] like it it wasn't it it wasn't a nice
[2:09:54] nice church. They were impregnated with
[2:09:57] something else.
[2:10:02] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:10:09] No syndicate entered that spot. When I
[2:10:12] seen those people, he said, "I want to
[2:10:15] turn, you turn with me to Luke 4:14 and
[2:10:20] 20, and I want to show you something
[2:10:23] striking."
[2:10:24] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:10:28] And here's the scripture. And the spirit
[2:10:30] of the Lord is upon me because he hath
[2:10:32] anointed me to preach the gospel to the
[2:10:35] poor. He hath to preach the gospel to
[2:10:39] the poor. He has sent me to heal the
[2:10:40] brokenhearted, to preach deliverance to
[2:10:43] the captives and recovering of sight to
[2:10:45] the blind, to set at liberty them that
[2:10:47] are bruised, to preach the acceptable
[2:10:50] year of the Lord. And he closed the
[2:10:52] book.
[2:10:53] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:10:55] &gt;&gt; Now, friend, I'm I hope that you are
[2:10:57] really alert.
[2:10:59] I'm really at the heart of my subject
[2:11:01] right now. This Lord Jesus
[2:11:04] &gt;&gt; who said, "Don't weep for me.
[2:11:07] &gt;&gt; Don't lament for me. Lament for your
[2:11:10] children."
[2:11:12] &gt;&gt; So the days will come when they say,
[2:11:14] "Blessed are the wounds that don't bear
[2:11:17] and the paps that don't give suck."
[2:11:20] They'll say that now is this Lord Jesus
[2:11:24] saying he sent me to heal the blind and
[2:11:27] do these and to preach the acceptable
[2:11:29] year of the Lord and he closed the book.
[2:11:37] He says a reference then he referenced
[2:11:40] Isaiah 611 and two. Now, isn't it
[2:11:44] strange? And I'll I'll read Isaiah 61 1
[2:11:47] and 2 for you.
[2:11:53] Now, I know that many of you, you know,
[2:11:56] you know where I'm going, but I'm but
[2:11:58] this is in a different context.
[2:12:02] And the spirit of the Lord God is upon
[2:12:04] me because he hath because he hath
[2:12:07] anointed me to preach good tidings
[2:12:10] unto the meek. He hath sent me to bind
[2:12:13] up the brokenhearted, to proclaim
[2:12:15] liberty to the captives, and the opening
[2:12:18] of the prison to them that are bound, to
[2:12:21] proclaim the acceptable year of the
[2:12:24] Lord, and the day of vengeance of our
[2:12:27] God. And now he's saying this is such a
[2:12:29] striking thing because when he got to
[2:12:33] that part, the acceptable year of the
[2:12:36] Lord and he closed the book.
[2:12:39] &gt;&gt; I'm here to say to you,
[2:12:44] we're not just members of Cloverdale
[2:12:46] Bible Way to come here to hear a
[2:12:47] service.
[2:12:49] I'm here to say to you, and in our day,
[2:12:52] in this last day,
[2:12:54] &gt;&gt; he's opened the book.
[2:12:55] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen.
[2:12:56] &gt;&gt; The book that was closed, he's opened
[2:12:58] the book.
[2:13:01] &gt;&gt; And he goes on to say, he referenced now
[2:13:03] 61, Isaiah 61 and2. Now, isn't it
[2:13:07] strange that he stopped right there and
[2:13:10] the very next verse that was what was
[2:13:12] applied to his first coming and the
[2:13:15] second? Next verse is applying to his
[2:13:18] second coming at judgment. He stopped
[2:13:22] and closed the book and he he refers to
[2:13:25] Scofield's note a comparison with the
[2:13:27] message quoted Isaiah 61 and and two
[2:13:31] affords the he said where the scripture
[2:13:34] here preaching Jesus was to preach
[2:13:36] acceptable year of the Lord and the next
[2:13:38] verse comes out with his coming and and
[2:13:41] judgment and you see how he stopped
[2:13:44] right at that. Now I want to just stop
[2:13:46] there for a moment. When Jesus said,
[2:13:51] come now back to my text. When Jesus
[2:13:53] said, "For the days will come," when
[2:13:57] they say, "Blessed are the those that
[2:13:59] don't bear. Blessed are they that don't
[2:14:01] have children."
[2:14:03] He said, "Tday will come when they will
[2:14:07] say mountains fall on us and hills cover
[2:14:10] us." Right.
[2:14:13] &gt;&gt; Jesus was actually speaking of this very
[2:14:16] time
[2:14:17] &gt;&gt; that we're in.
[2:14:18] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:14:19] &gt;&gt; And I feel that I need to announce to
[2:14:22] you and say to you that Satan is far
[2:14:26] more cunning than we want to give him
[2:14:28] credit for.
[2:14:30] &gt;&gt; He invades every area of life.
[2:14:34] And I want to announce also that God has
[2:14:37] pressurized you
[2:14:39] &gt;&gt; and given you insight so that you can
[2:14:42] see
[2:14:43] &gt;&gt; what you need to see and given you the
[2:14:46] power to resist what you need to resist.
[2:14:49] It's not enough for a minister to do so.
[2:14:52] It is you have to take that place. You
[2:14:54] have to take that place. Say this is not
[2:14:57] in the word of God. This is not what
[2:15:00] they do in the word of God. And we need
[2:15:02] to hold that standard
[2:15:04] very very high
[2:15:16] &gt;&gt; in the end time. I just have this. I'm
[2:15:18] going to close.
[2:15:24] I just read that in this day, the end
[2:15:28] time.
[2:15:29] I don't know what that means to you.
[2:15:32] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:15:35] &gt;&gt; What would happen if you didn't have a
[2:15:36] church
[2:15:38] that believed that the word of God had
[2:15:40] become revealed?
[2:15:42] &gt;&gt; Where would you be?
[2:15:48] Says, "And he began calling his
[2:15:50] children." I want to read this roll call
[2:15:53] in heaven.
[2:15:57] If a man die, shall he live again?
[2:15:59] That's Job asked that. All the days of
[2:16:03] my appointed time will I wait till my
[2:16:05] change come. Thou shalt call and I will
[2:16:09] answer.
[2:16:11] &gt;&gt; I have no question that he has called.
[2:16:14] Now I'm asking you as a congregation. I
[2:16:16] want you to ask yourself seriously, have
[2:16:19] I answered?
[2:16:21] &gt;&gt; Not just to say yes, I surrender all or
[2:16:24] sing a nice song. have I surrendered.
[2:16:30] He shall call and I will answer thee.
[2:16:32] Thou will have a desire to the work of
[2:16:34] thy hands. He said the great shepherd is
[2:16:37] calling his sheep by name.
[2:16:39] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:16:40] &gt;&gt; The creative voice of God is calling
[2:16:42] them forth from the dust or changing
[2:16:45] their atoms even though they had not
[2:16:48] fallen asleep.
[2:16:49] &gt;&gt; It is the rapture. It is the great
[2:16:52] marriage supper of the lamb and his
[2:16:54] bride.
[2:16:56] &gt;&gt; Listen church, young people, everyone
[2:16:58] here that's listening to my voice,
[2:17:02] we refer to a message all the time. And
[2:17:05] I'm closing. It's not a Sunday morning
[2:17:07] service. If I walked off this platform
[2:17:10] and never came here again, I would feel
[2:17:13] that these next few moments would have
[2:17:15] fulfilled my purpose in life. It is to
[2:17:18] tell you this message. God sent this
[2:17:22] vindicated voice
[2:17:24] to call you from the dust of the earth.
[2:17:30] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:17:32] &gt;&gt; G.
[2:17:33] &gt;&gt; You're in dust.
[2:17:35] &gt;&gt; And that dust if time should go on is
[2:17:38] going to turn to a tablespoon of ashes.
[2:17:42] But that which is in you, that soul, God
[2:17:45] sent this message and this messenger
[2:17:49] uncompromisingly
[2:17:50] to let you know the state of the message
[2:17:54] and where it is and the present stage.
[2:17:57] And if you want to read uh the re read
[2:18:00] the present stage of my ministry, you
[2:18:02] should go home and read it. You'll find
[2:18:04] this sequence perfectly in place. And
[2:18:07] this call, this call is out. This
[2:18:11] message is actually calling out.
[2:18:14] &gt;&gt; And that is why that is why Satan is
[2:18:17] doing everything in his power. He wants
[2:18:20] to he wants to make the message and the
[2:18:23] ministers distraught or distressed or
[2:18:27] weary and the people weary. I hear this
[2:18:30] and I hear that.
[2:18:32] That's a place where you need to resist.
[2:18:36] Amen.
[2:18:37] [Music]
[2:18:40] &gt;&gt; That's when you need to resist.
[2:18:42] &gt;&gt; That's what you resist it.
[2:18:46] &gt;&gt; Don't give your ear to that
[2:18:48] &gt;&gt; any more than you'd give it to unclean
[2:18:50] living
[2:18:52] &gt;&gt; or something in the world.
[2:18:55] &gt;&gt; Movies don't attract us or entertain us
[2:18:58] or, you know, we we're not even
[2:18:59] interested in that. But something that
[2:19:01] sounds, you know, uh some some
[2:19:05] discussion about the message or whatever
[2:19:08] more that's if you need to hear it, we
[2:19:11] hear it from the messenger himself.
[2:19:14] [Applause]
[2:19:26] &gt;&gt; It's calling him forth from the dust of
[2:19:28] the earth.
[2:19:31] And I said to God this morning,
[2:19:36] it's the marriage supper of the lamb.
[2:19:40] I said, "You call, Lord.
[2:19:45] This is the call from the dust of the
[2:19:47] earth."
[2:19:47] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:19:49] &gt;&gt; I I've taken too many funerals.
[2:19:53] I've seen life pass so swiftly.
[2:19:57] And I can tell you young men, young
[2:19:59] ladies, the best thing that you can do,
[2:20:02] the best thing you can do,
[2:20:05] &gt;&gt; the best thing that you can do is to
[2:20:08] give your life to the gospel.
[2:20:10] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:20:12] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:20:13] Amen.
[2:20:23] &gt;&gt; I hope you understand me when I say
[2:20:30] I had a grandson and he was pretty good
[2:20:33] at
[2:20:35] basketball.
[2:20:39] And I just said to him, and he's
[2:20:41] probably listening right now, I said,
[2:20:44] "There's no future on bouncing that
[2:20:46] ball.
[2:20:48] There's no future in it.
[2:20:57] I had a little
[2:20:59] piece of history and I I didn't bring
[2:21:02] it.
[2:21:03] I thought it wasn't necessary to read,
[2:21:07] but it was the from the State Department
[2:21:09] in the United States
[2:21:12] from the economic department of what $5
[2:21:15] would buy and they went to 1913.
[2:21:18] Oh friends,
[2:21:21] I love you and I'd like to be able to
[2:21:23] say this and I'd like you to be able to
[2:21:24] hold on to it. said in 1913, they went
[2:21:27] back to 1913 because they said that was
[2:21:30] when the United States went off the gold
[2:21:34] standard
[2:21:36] and turned everything into the hands of
[2:21:38] the Federal Reserve,
[2:21:41] which I understand is just a private
[2:21:43] business
[2:21:45] and said then decided to run the country
[2:21:47] on printed money
[2:21:51] and that is how that economy they said
[2:21:54] on 1913 13. If you sent someone to the
[2:21:57] store with $5,
[2:22:00] you would not believe the list of things
[2:22:02] they could buy for $5.
[2:22:06] 10 lb of this and five lbs of chuck
[2:22:08] roast and so many steaks and on and on.
[2:22:12] So many pounds of rice and so many
[2:22:14] pounds of this and so many pounds of
[2:22:15] that. And at the end they said, "And
[2:22:18] then you you'll still have two cents
[2:22:20] left for some candy.
[2:22:23] $5 won't even buy you a a good mocha
[2:22:27] down in Starbucks.
[2:22:32] And what happened? And and and then and
[2:22:35] then you think that the prophet left
[2:22:37] that without saying something. No, he
[2:22:39] goes right to the gold standard.
[2:22:42] And I'm not even going to begin to speak
[2:22:44] to it, but he speaks. What is he doing?
[2:22:46] He's talking right at the roots of the
[2:22:47] economy.
[2:22:50] So why am I saying this to you? Don't
[2:22:52] put your faith in paper.
[2:22:59] &gt;&gt; You're looking at a man.
[2:23:02] I've had I've had right in front of me.
[2:23:05] Right in front of me. A shoe box. A shoe
[2:23:07] box full of money on its edge. Packed.
[2:23:15] Milk. This from your country.
[2:23:20] and the kids were playing with it and
[2:23:23] the people in that home had a sick child
[2:23:28] and that shoe box of money wouldn't even
[2:23:30] buy them some aspirins
[2:23:32] and furthermore they couldn't even find
[2:23:34] any because there was no medication.
[2:23:37] It's a modern city,
[2:23:38] &gt;&gt; right?
[2:23:41] &gt;&gt; This is place this
[2:23:43] economy people trusted in.
[2:23:47] They had universities. They had doctors.
[2:23:50] They had nurses.
[2:23:54] &gt;&gt; Don't trust in these things.
[2:23:59] &gt;&gt; I said, "Can I have some of this money?"
[2:24:01] They said, "Yeah." I took 30 billion
[2:24:05] dollars out of that shoe box. You
[2:24:08] couldn't even know it was gone. It had
[2:24:09] so many cir had so many zeros on it. And
[2:24:12] Milco says, "We've already taken four
[2:24:14] zeros off.
[2:24:19] My brother-in-law was in north in north
[2:24:21] Italy during the war and a woman was
[2:24:25] just begging for a loaf of bread, just a
[2:24:27] loaf of bread.
[2:24:29] And she's trying to get a man to give
[2:24:31] her a loaf of bread. And she had a whole
[2:24:33] bunch of money,
[2:24:35] millions of dollars in marks, German
[2:24:37] marks. Germany has come back up in the
[2:24:40] world, but not then.
[2:24:43] She had a whole wheelbarrow of this
[2:24:45] stuff wanting to buy a loaf of bread.
[2:24:50] And my brother-in-law, who was not
[2:24:52] converted then, he took a pack of
[2:24:54] cigarettes out of his pocket and just
[2:24:56] shook one out. One cigarette.
[2:24:59] Said, "Give her the bread." And I gave
[2:25:02] her a loaf of bread.
[2:25:06] We don't trust in vain riches.
[2:25:11] &gt;&gt; It's just paper.
[2:25:14] We don't trust this system.
[2:25:17] &gt;&gt; I've I've I've employed people
[2:25:23] and I I'm sitting upstairs and someone
[2:25:25] says to me, "You see that man sweeping
[2:25:27] the floor down there?" I said, "Yeah, he
[2:25:30] he's got some degrees in university.
[2:25:33] He's been going to university for 20ome
[2:25:35] years.
[2:25:37] He's got his master's degree in this or
[2:25:39] that or whatever more. He's so educated
[2:25:41] he can't get a job.
[2:25:45] said, "Well, well, that isn't my
[2:25:46] situation." It could be.
[2:25:50] &gt;&gt; That's the world we're in,
[2:25:51] &gt;&gt; right?
[2:25:52] &gt;&gt; That happens to be the world we're in,
[2:25:54] friends.
[2:25:55] &gt;&gt; And the economy, the economics, don't
[2:25:58] trust it.
[2:25:59] &gt;&gt; It can just go sideways.
[2:26:07] &gt;&gt; You're looking at a person. I've paid
[2:26:11] I've paid myself since I was 15 years
[2:26:13] old. I've paid into the Canada Pension
[2:26:16] Plan.
[2:26:20] They took it right off my paycheck.
[2:26:24] I paid into it all of these years.
[2:26:28] And now because they can write, they can
[2:26:29] write whatever regulations they want to
[2:26:31] write. So they say, "Oh, you're still
[2:26:34] working. You still have an income from
[2:26:36] the from the church." So, we claw all
[2:26:39] that back and anything that you wouldn't
[2:26:42] even buy a room for you. Wouldn't buy
[2:26:44] you room and gas for your car. $900 or
[2:26:48] something. And they claw all that back.
[2:26:51] Not even their money. Never was their
[2:26:53] money. They've been using it for 60
[2:26:56] years. They claw it all back.
[2:27:00] What are you going to do? Stomp your
[2:27:01] foot on the floor.
[2:27:04] What are you going to do? You say, "Oh,
[2:27:06] I have a 401k." Yeah.
[2:27:10] Well,
[2:27:12] I don't know what you have. Say, "Why
[2:27:14] are you preaching this way?" Because
[2:27:16] Satan has gotten into every government.
[2:27:19] Satan has got into every system. Don't
[2:27:21] forget it, friends. He is too cunning.
[2:27:24] He's got behind every religion. He's got
[2:27:27] behind all of these things. And for you
[2:27:29] to hear that he that he's using the
[2:27:31] internet or using this, I don't even
[2:27:33] talk about it.
[2:27:35] &gt;&gt; Of course he's using it.
[2:27:37] &gt;&gt; That's his kind of thing.
[2:27:43] &gt;&gt; You know,
[2:27:45] you see us up here in a suit and all the
[2:27:47] rest of it. I can tell you I and my wife
[2:27:51] I and my wife stood we've stood at the
[2:27:53] borders with armed guards trying to get
[2:27:57] across borders. There's people here who
[2:28:00] are sitting here in this service right
[2:28:02] now who had to hide. There's a man
[2:28:05] looking at me right now that told me I
[2:28:07] didn't see the sun for 15 months and 10
[2:28:10] days.
[2:28:17] There's people here in this church
[2:28:19] educated.
[2:28:20] They got degrees from other countries
[2:28:26] and they come to this country and have
[2:28:28] to get re-educated and hopefully get a
[2:28:31] number and hopefully get certified and
[2:28:33] hopefully maybe they can teach, maybe
[2:28:35] they can be a nurse, maybe be something
[2:28:39] because the whole thing had collapsed.
[2:28:42] &gt;&gt; Right.
[2:28:43] Don't put your trust in your youth or
[2:28:48] your strengths or your beauty or your
[2:28:51] skills or paper or the government or
[2:28:54] anything else. You can only put say
[2:28:56] where will we put our confidence? You
[2:28:58] better just say like Peter when Jesus
[2:29:01] said do you want to leave me?
[2:29:07] &gt;&gt; Amen. And when you read when you read
[2:29:10] the present stage of my ministry, put
[2:29:12] yourself there because that's this
[2:29:15] ministry is
[2:29:17] &gt;&gt; that's the call. If I can say anything
[2:29:21] to you and I'm done.
[2:29:25] I do not believe that there's another
[2:29:27] voice coming
[2:29:28] &gt;&gt; to call the people from the dust of the
[2:29:30] earth.
[2:29:33] &gt;&gt; There has to be a word with transforming
[2:29:35] power. Amen.
[2:29:36] &gt;&gt; That's it.
[2:29:37] &gt;&gt; And if this isn't it, then we have
[2:29:40] certainly been deceived.
[2:29:43] &gt;&gt; I tell you what, if this is not it, but
[2:29:46] if it is it, it deserves everything
[2:29:48] we've got. It deserves the best of our
[2:29:51] life. It deserves everything. It
[2:29:54] deserves your finances. And we don't
[2:29:56] need it. We don't want, we're not asking
[2:29:58] for that, but deserves everything.
[2:30:01] &gt;&gt; It deserves your youth, young people.
[2:30:04] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:30:05] Amen.
[2:30:07] &gt;&gt; And if I had mine again, I would do it
[2:30:09] exactly the same thing.
[2:30:11] &gt;&gt; I would give I I would do whatever I
[2:30:13] could.
[2:30:14] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:30:16] &gt;&gt; I hope you get a car.
[2:30:18] &gt;&gt; I financed and bought a new car. And
[2:30:21] what I'm doing with it the first Sunday,
[2:30:24] I'm picking up kids for the Sunday
[2:30:26] school
[2:30:27] &gt;&gt; to drive them to Sunday school. And
[2:30:30] today I heard an announcement. you know
[2:30:31] who got place to keep some of these
[2:30:34] people so on. We had people in our house
[2:30:36] all the time.
[2:30:38] &gt;&gt; God bless the Hoffman family. I talked
[2:30:40] to sister Hoffman. I said I heard
[2:30:42] somebody else can I said can I come to
[2:30:44] your house and live there? She said if
[2:30:47] just we have to find a bed.
[2:30:51] Can you take one more person? Well just
[2:30:54] as long as we have a bed. You get a
[2:30:57] mattress
[2:30:58] room for one more. and I went and picked
[2:31:01] up kids. Why am I telling you this? The
[2:31:04] gospel comes this way.
[2:31:07] &gt;&gt; This is It's on the shoulders of the
[2:31:09] gospel. It's on the shoulders of the
[2:31:11] working people.
[2:31:12] &gt;&gt; It's not on the shoulders of the rich.
[2:31:14] It's on the shoulders of the poor.
[2:31:17] &gt;&gt; I know I preached you out, but I'm going
[2:31:19] to preach it just till I'm getting it
[2:31:21] home.
[2:31:23] &gt;&gt; This is the word. And you you have to
[2:31:24] decide something probably this morning,
[2:31:27] not just a sermon. say, "Oh, Brother Tom
[2:31:29] or Brother John or Brother Tim or
[2:31:31] Brother Ed, somebody's preaching."
[2:31:33] That's not the point. Is this the
[2:31:35] message or isn't it the message? Is this
[2:31:38] the call? Is this the voice of God?
[2:31:41] &gt;&gt; Is this what it says? What Apostle Paul
[2:31:43] says
[2:31:44] &gt;&gt; who's in prison say, "You want to listen
[2:31:46] to a guy that's in prison that can't
[2:31:48] even have a following and has one coat?
[2:31:51] Bring my coat. It's cold."
[2:31:54] &gt;&gt; Have you been influenced? Are you
[2:31:56] influenced sufficiently? say, "Well,
[2:31:58] it's in it's in it's in the Bible." No,
[2:32:00] no. The man's in jail.
[2:32:03] &gt;&gt; The man hasn't even got a a
[2:32:05] congregation.
[2:32:07] &gt;&gt; The man hasn't got any money.
[2:32:10] &gt;&gt; He's just got a coat. All my friends
[2:32:12] have left me.
[2:32:13] &gt;&gt; All the counselors, all the big people
[2:32:15] have left.
[2:32:17] &gt;&gt; You want to be part of that church? You
[2:32:19] want to be part of Jesus church?
[2:32:21] &gt;&gt; Jesus church whose secretary just
[2:32:24] committed suicide. Is that the church
[2:32:26] you want to be? You got to have a
[2:32:28] revelation of who that man was.
[2:32:30] &gt;&gt; Nobody else would agree with you. Said
[2:32:33] this is the prince of peace. The prince
[2:32:35] of peace hanging on that cross. What are
[2:32:38] you telling me? Ah, you're wild. Let me
[2:32:41] be wild then. You're a fanatic. Let me
[2:32:44] be a fanatic. You want to listen to this
[2:32:47] man? Did you read the internet lately?
[2:32:49] No, I haven't read the internet lately.
[2:32:51] I've read the Bible lately
[2:32:54] and I can tell you one thing, this
[2:32:56] message has revealed Jesus Christ in
[2:32:58] this Bible.
[2:33:00] And if time will go on, that change the
[2:33:04] course of history has been changed by a
[2:33:07] man of God,
[2:33:09] &gt;&gt; a prophet of God has actually changed
[2:33:11] it. Who introduced a serpent seedl?
[2:33:17] &gt;&gt; So, oh, we heard that long time ago. I
[2:33:20] even heard that Catholics used to used
[2:33:22] to believe something along that line
[2:33:24] years ago. Rabbi Richmond told me that
[2:33:27] some of the mystics of the of the Cabala
[2:33:30] or the Jewish Orthodox Jewish faith,
[2:33:32] they believe that. And I said, "Well,
[2:33:33] they believe that that Cain was a
[2:33:36] product." No, he said they haven't gone
[2:33:37] that far.
[2:33:40] You got to have the twins.
[2:33:45] One man who used to profess this message
[2:33:47] met me down on the on the White Rock
[2:33:50] Prominad and says, "Oh, I've been I've
[2:33:52] been wanting to see you." I said, "Is
[2:33:53] that right?" I said, "I" He said, "You
[2:33:56] know what?" He said, "If I could have
[2:33:58] you for a little while, I could I I'd
[2:34:00] like to tell you that that serpent seed
[2:34:02] is not of not of God." I said, "Is that
[2:34:04] right?" I said, "I can." He said, "I can
[2:34:06] prove it." I said, "Is that right?" I
[2:34:08] said, 'Well, ju just have a look down
[2:34:10] this prominad and tell me that this is
[2:34:12] all all God's children.
[2:34:17] Have a look at all this nakedness and
[2:34:20] tell me that I said, "Come on."
[2:34:23] &gt;&gt; And he was without words.
[2:34:26] He's without words. The truth was
[2:34:28] silence on friends. You got to be
[2:34:31] convinced of this.
[2:34:32] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:34:34] &gt;&gt; You say you are enthused about this. I
[2:34:36] say I'm enthused about it.
[2:34:39] &gt;&gt; What a glorious thing that God's so
[2:34:41] privileged you
[2:34:43] &gt;&gt; to believe this word and to be able to
[2:34:45] say yes.
[2:34:47] &gt;&gt; This is my life.
[2:34:49] [Applause]
[2:34:51] &gt;&gt; And Satan doesn't want you to make that
[2:34:53] commitment because he's a he's afraid of
[2:34:55] the influence and the effect that you'll
[2:34:56] have. I said go out from this place and
[2:34:59] have a powerful effect. Don't just be
[2:35:02] carried along on a wave of, you know, uh
[2:35:04] of non-committal. be committed.
[2:35:08] &gt;&gt; Said to all you people on the balcony,
[2:35:10] wherever you are in this building, we
[2:35:12] need men and women committed.
[2:35:15] &gt;&gt; I find those in the scripture, we're
[2:35:17] committed. And I want to rub shoulders
[2:35:19] with them on the other side and feel
[2:35:22] that I've been true to my age.
[2:35:24] &gt;&gt; God bless you. Pressure eyes for this
[2:35:28] age.
[2:35:30] [Music]
[2:35:30] [Applause]
[2:35:32] &gt;&gt; You may not feel pressurized for
[2:35:33] anything. You need to be at this altar.
[2:35:35] Say, "God, I give myself to you.
[2:35:39] &gt;&gt; I'm pressurized for this age and I'll
[2:35:42] stand true to it."
[2:35:47] &gt;&gt; Lord God,
[2:35:48] &gt;&gt; dear heavenly father,
[2:35:50] &gt;&gt; we've done what we felt you would have
[2:35:52] us to do,
[2:35:54] &gt;&gt; to declare your truth and declare your
[2:35:56] word.
[2:35:57] &gt;&gt; Yes, Lord.
[2:35:58] &gt;&gt; And you will not stand behind anything
[2:36:00] that's not truth. I pray, Father, you'll
[2:36:03] take the fervor of spirit and baptize
[2:36:07] everyone with a fresh baptism of the
[2:36:10] Holy Ghost. I pray the same spirit that
[2:36:13] brought the word will live the word out
[2:36:15] through these individuals. I pray you'll
[2:36:18] bless these ministers that are here, oh
[2:36:20] God, bless them that have given
[2:36:22] themselves, given their lives, given
[2:36:25] their homes, given their families. Bless
[2:36:27] them, Father, in the name of Jesus
[2:36:29] Christ. Bless this congregation. I pray,
[2:36:33] oh God, that the fire of God will burn
[2:36:37] until it's attracted the people and
[2:36:40] those that are your calling. May they
[2:36:42] come. May they come and see what is
[2:36:44] happening. I pray, Father, in the name
[2:36:47] of Jesus Christ, you'll receive us.
[2:36:50] Forgive us for anything that we have
[2:36:51] said or done wrong. Now you we be washed
[2:36:55] by the only only blood, the only
[2:36:57] sacrifice, the sacrifice of Jesus
[2:37:00] Christ. Thank you, Father, for the
[2:37:03] people that so support your word, your
[2:37:06] work. I pray you'll bless the ministers
[2:37:09] of the bride of Jesus Christ
[2:37:12] &gt;&gt; around the world. Oh God, many of them
[2:37:15] are in severe difficulties. I pray,
[2:37:17] Father, you'll see our hearts. We desire
[2:37:20] that they will be provided for, Lord, in
[2:37:24] Jesus Christ's name. We're not here to
[2:37:26] serve with lip service. We're here to be
[2:37:29] active
[2:37:30] &gt;&gt; in your kingdom, oh God,
[2:37:32] &gt;&gt; in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.
[2:37:36] &gt;&gt; Amen. If you'd like to stand please,
[2:37:38] with me, Brother Nathan, if you'd come,
[2:37:41] please, I want to sing that song. I
[2:37:44] believe it was written by
[2:37:46] uh
[2:37:50] what's his name?
[2:37:52] Not Morai Ham, but
[2:37:58] Gypsy Smith, I believe, wrote this song.
[2:38:02] Like you to sing it with me.
[2:38:05] Jesus revealed in me.
[2:38:12] Sing it as you mean it.
[2:38:17] Just wait till we get it out, please.
[2:38:27] 869,
[2:38:28] [Music]
[2:38:38] making his glory
[2:38:41] shine.
[2:38:45] Oh, to reflect
[2:38:47] his grace,

[2:38:56] [Music]
[2:38:59] that will
[2:39:02] shall
[2:39:05] Jesus redee.
[2:39:09] &gt;&gt; Now, just before you sing these, I felt
[2:39:12] led to have this song.
[2:39:15] And I'm asking you as an individual
[2:39:18] individually
[2:39:20] you'll say say every one of these words
[2:39:23] from the depth of your heart and say
[2:39:25] this is the direction for me
[2:39:29] here Lord I bring my heart
[2:39:36] my love my strength my will
[2:39:40] [Music]
[2:39:43] cleanse
[2:39:44] in every
[2:39:46] heart
[2:39:49] with all my spirit
[2:39:53] filled
[2:39:55] [Music]
[2:39:59] his grace
[2:40:03] causing the world to see
[2:40:10] love and Oh, till the power shall go
[2:40:17] Jesus reveal
[2:40:20] in me. Every word now
[2:40:24] life is no longer
[2:40:27] [Music]
[2:40:34] to me.
[2:40:36] [Music]
[2:40:39] I
[2:40:43] God
[2:40:49] [Music]
[2:40:52] reflect
[2:40:54] his graing
[2:40:57] [Music]
[2:40:59] the world to sing.
[2:41:04] The man will
[2:41:09] sh
[2:41:11] Jesus
[2:41:14] in me.
[2:41:18] Tri
[2:41:21] is mine.
[2:41:25] Now Jesus reigns with
[2:41:31] he
[2:41:33] joing
[2:41:37] [Music]
[2:41:46] [Music]
[2:41:52] the world to See
[2:41:58] love that will grow.
[2:42:01] [Music]
[2:42:05] Jesus reveal
[2:42:08] in me.
[2:42:11] &gt;&gt; In a few moments, we're going to pray.
[2:42:14] I'd like to give you a secret about
[2:42:15] prayer. It's not a big complicated
[2:42:18] thing. You don't have to come up and
[2:42:20] pound the altar.
[2:42:24] Jesus is our pattern.
[2:42:27] &gt;&gt; And Jesus would ask, "Believe us thou
[2:42:30] this?" "Yay, Lord." And he gave them
[2:42:34] what they asked. That simple.
[2:42:38] Brother Brandon would have people
[2:42:39] standing here and I've watched it and
[2:42:42] he'd say, "Do you believe, sister?
[2:42:45] Do you believe, brother?" And a simple
[2:42:48] answer, "Yes, I do. God bless you." and
[2:42:52] would give them what they asked for.
[2:42:54] It's just that simple. What is that
[2:42:57] desire you have? Don't let the devil
[2:43:00] creep into this sanctuary and make you
[2:43:03] think that you've got to go through some
[2:43:05] antics and you have to reach up and you
[2:43:07] have to get some you've got to fast for
[2:43:09] days and you've got to do something. You
[2:43:11] don't have to do anything. Believe it.
[2:43:14] &gt;&gt; Just believe it.
[2:43:17] &gt;&gt; That's all. Believe it. that you're the
[2:43:20] one, oh God.
[2:43:21] &gt;&gt; You have to energize me.
[2:43:23] &gt;&gt; You have to give me the resisting power.
[2:43:26] You have to give me the Holy Ghost. I
[2:43:28] just believe it. Just simple. I've tried
[2:43:31] everything. He said, don't try to press
[2:43:33] yourself. You can't press yourself. You
[2:43:35] can't attain it. You've tried all of
[2:43:37] that. Just say, I believe it, oh boy,
[2:43:40] all this life is no longer mine.
[2:43:43] I give it all to you. If you can mean
[2:43:46] that, he'll come right now and do that.
[2:43:49] And we're going to pray. Life is no
[2:43:51] longer mine. Once more
[2:44:02] you all toe
[2:44:05] [Music]
[2:44:15] until I face the sea.
[2:44:21] [Music]
[2:44:23] to reflect his praise.
[2:44:29] Bring the world to see
[2:44:35] love that will
[2:44:38] [Music]
[2:44:40] shall go.
[2:44:43] Jesus reveal
[2:44:46] me.
[2:44:48] We will bow our heads in prayer.
[2:44:54] I'll ask you if you have a desire in
[2:44:57] your heart or a need.
[2:45:00] Perhaps you'd like to raise your hand to
[2:45:02] him. I'm not looking.
[2:45:05] Don't want anyone else to look between
[2:45:08] you and God.
[2:45:11] You see, Lord Jesus, the preacher just
[2:45:14] said, "All I have to say is I believe
[2:45:16] it. I'm coming to you now. I've tried
[2:45:20] all kinds of things. I've made promises.
[2:45:23] I failed.
[2:45:25] But now I come, I just say, I believe
[2:45:27] it. I believe in you. I believe that
[2:45:30] this is your word. I believe that this
[2:45:31] is your voice that you've sent.
[2:45:34] And now, Father, with the response from
[2:45:37] the people, whatever it may be, you know
[2:45:39] the heart. You know this, those that
[2:45:42] need it.
[2:45:43] You know what is what we have need of.
[2:45:46] And oh God, I have many needs. and the
[2:45:49] congregation perhaps have many needs,
[2:45:52] varied needs from different directions.
[2:45:54] They got different desires they're
[2:45:56] praying about. But I pray that none of
[2:45:58] those desires will have anything to do
[2:46:00] with this world. But it will have to do
[2:46:02] to position themselves for the world
[2:46:05] that is coming for the world that
[2:46:07] they've even been called into. And you
[2:46:09] have sent a voice, Lord. Let me say it
[2:46:10] plainly. You sent a voice to call the
[2:46:13] people out of the dust of the earth.
[2:46:15] &gt;&gt; This world. This world. Oh God, your
[2:46:19] voice is calling them out of this world
[2:46:22] into another place into a heavenly
[2:46:24] place. Heavenly place they can even
[2:46:27] dwell in heavenly places in Christ Jesus
[2:46:30] at this very moment. Take them. I pray
[2:46:33] that today. May there be a sacredness
[2:46:35] upon this day. May people be have the
[2:46:38] somnity of the Holy Spirit as they
[2:46:41] consider oh God what it is that you
[2:46:43] desire for them. I pray father that as
[2:46:46] we dedicate ourselves to you, we
[2:46:49] dedicate ourselves body, spirit and
[2:46:51] soul, every w we dedicate ourselves to
[2:46:54] you as a congregation. And now we thank
[2:46:56] you father. I thank you Jesus
[2:47:02] for experiencing hell
[2:47:05] on my behalf
[2:47:07] so that I would not have to go.
[2:47:11] &gt;&gt; I thank you Lord Jesus.
[2:47:14] I thank you, Lord Jesus.
[2:47:16] How true it was when you told the women,
[2:47:18] "Don't lament for me. Pray for yourself
[2:47:21] and for your children, oh God. And here
[2:47:24] we are, children of this day, but we're
[2:47:26] children of this message. We're children
[2:47:28] of this word. We're children who's been
[2:47:30] called by the voice of God. We're
[2:47:32] children, oh God, that have been elected
[2:47:34] and dedicated for the rapture of the
[2:47:36] church, for the catching away. We do not
[2:47:39] know how. We do not know when, oh God,
[2:47:42] but we say with all that is within us.
[2:47:45] Here I am, oh God. I'm here to be your
[2:47:48] testimony. I'm here to be your witness.
[2:47:50] I'm here to stand with Apostle Paul. I'm
[2:47:52] here to stand with the prophets of old.
[2:47:54] I'm here to stand with the messenger of
[2:47:56] this age. Oh God, I'm here to stand and
[2:47:59] say amen to that which has been
[2:48:01] preached. Father, here we are. We pray
[2:48:04] that you'll accept us and receive us in
[2:48:07] the name of Jesus Christ. We call it
[2:48:08] done and finished in Jesus name.
[2:48:13] We thank you Lord.
[2:48:15] Oh we thank you Lord Lord.
[2:48:19] &gt;&gt; Oh we thank you Lord.
[2:48:22] Hallelujah. God bless you. I'm sorry for
[2:48:26] keeping you as long as I have. I realize
[2:48:28] the time slipped along but something for
[2:48:31] you to think about. Something for you to
[2:48:32] give yourself to. You have heard the
[2:48:35] voice of God.
[2:48:37] That's what you've heard down in your
[2:48:39] soul.
[2:48:40] &gt;&gt; I say give yourself unreservedly to it
[2:48:44] &gt;&gt; and make it a dedicated so you don't
[2:48:46] have to do it over and over again. You
[2:48:48] don't have to do it over again.
[2:48:51] &gt;&gt; I can tell you friends, I can tell you
[2:48:53] do it once and it's done.
[2:48:55] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:48:57] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. None of this wishy-washy
[2:48:59] stuff. You just do it. You set your
[2:49:01] sights on the prize of the high calling
[2:49:03] and go in that direction. God bless you
[2:49:05] all. You're dismissed in Jesus Christ's
[2:49:07] name.
[2:49:09] Amen. God bless you.
