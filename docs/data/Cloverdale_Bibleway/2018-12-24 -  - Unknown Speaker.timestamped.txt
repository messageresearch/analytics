[26:56] season in time when it's a good time to
[26:58] give out and be a blessing and God bless
[27:00] you
[27:01] I saw you brother Nathan almost all of
[27:02] those photos and I think that's good hey
[27:05] man she keeps shining the light and
[27:08] tonight is the last service before
[27:11] Christmas and we just want to make the
[27:14] Lord encourage you tonight we stand
[27:16] again and turn right to the scripture
[27:21] Psalms chapter 89 if we could turn to
[27:24] two places
[27:25] thank you brother Derek it's hard to say
[27:28] see you next year but hey man it's good
[27:32] we'll see one another again him in
[27:35] Psalms 89 and then Matthew chapter 1 I
[27:40] think it's good to look at one another
[27:43] as gifts and be thankful amen do you
[27:48] agree with that and let's be happy as we
[27:50] see one another brother Marcos here all
[27:53] the way from Paradise California in the
[27:56] last few days and he's going back there
[27:58] I understand we just never know what's
[28:01] going to happen in our lives there was a
[28:04] brother I'll just say this as you're
[28:06] standing just a Wednesday night before
[28:08] last he was in the service down at
[28:11] brother Tim Pruett church for the
[28:12] Whistler really fine brother sits on the
[28:15] second row right row brother sterling
[28:16] sitting and I saw him raising his hands
[28:20] and worshiping God on the Wednesday
[28:22] night and by the Thursday morning he'd
[28:25] had a stroke and he had went to where he
[28:28] wasn't really a lot coherent and he
[28:31] passed away this last Wednesday morning
[28:33] and I thought from one week to the next
[28:36] week can have a brother or sister right
[28:38] in our church or it could be a family
[28:40] member and they could just be right
[28:44] among us and within just a few days they
[28:47] could be gone we want to make sure that
[28:49] we treasure one another and make sure
[28:51] that our offerings to one another is
[28:53] something that we appreciate so god
[28:56] bless you tonight we appreciate you
[28:58] Psalms chapter 89 verse 50 these are
[29:04] verses brother Branham read and a
[29:06] message Christmas message Psalms 89
[29:12] verse 50 remember Lord the reproach of
[29:14] thy sir
[29:15] servants how I do bear in my bosom the
[29:18] reproach of all the mighty people where
[29:22] with nine enemies have reproached Oh
[29:25] Lord wherewith have they reproached the
[29:28] footsteps of thine anointed but David
[29:32] didn't stop there he said blessed be the
[29:34] Lord forevermore amen and amen and
[29:38] tonight we'd like to speak on from
[29:40] reproach to a new born faith so let's
[29:44] turn to Matthew chapter 1 kind of a
[29:53] family night's sermon for us sermon
[29:57] before Christmas there's something real
[30:00] though that the Lord can give to the
[30:02] family Matthew chapter 1 verse 18 now
[30:08] the birth of Jesus Christ was on this
[30:11] wise when as his mother as you just
[30:16] listen really closely there's a lot of
[30:18] paradoxes in these verses when as his
[30:22] mother Mary was espoused or engaged to
[30:25] Joseph before they came together she was
[30:29] found with child of the Holy Ghost then
[30:35] Joseph her husband being a just man and
[30:39] not willing to make her a public example
[30:42] was minded to put her away privately but
[30:46] while he thought on these things behold
[30:49] the angel of the Lord appeared unto Him
[30:52] in a dream saying Joseph thou son of
[30:56] David fear not to take unto thee Mary
[30:59] thy wife for that which is conceived in
[31:03] her is of the Holy Ghost and brother
[31:07] Branham stops and he spoke about how
[31:09] they were engaged they were espoused but
[31:12] the Bible says they were married and thy
[31:15] husband and thy wife so engagements very
[31:19] serious it's not something to be taken
[31:21] lightly verse 21 and she she shall bring
[31:26] forth a son
[31:28] thou shalt call his name Jesus for he
[31:31] shall save his people from their sins
[31:34] now all this was done that it might be
[31:37] fulfilled which was spoken of the Lord
[31:39] by the Prophet saying behold a virgin
[31:42] this is Isaiah 7 a virgin shall be with
[31:46] child and shall bring forth a son and
[31:50] they shall call his name Emmanuel which
[31:54] being interpreted is God with us God
[31:57] with us hallelujah
[32:01] then Joseph being raised from sleep did
[32:06] as the angel of the Lord had bidden him
[32:09] and took unto him his wife and knew her
[32:14] not till she had brought forth her
[32:17] firstborn son and he called his name
[32:22] Jesus amen can we bow our heads our dear
[32:27] Heavenly Father we're so thankful that
[32:30] we have the truth of Christmas that you
[32:33] wasn't born in December but you were
[32:36] born like all lambs in the springtime
[32:38] but this was the season of the year that
[32:41] your prophet was led by the Holy Ghost
[32:44] to speak so many Christmas messages it
[32:47] was bringing the truth to the bride that
[32:50] it's not Jesus in a little manger but
[32:53] it's Jesus in our hearts Lord the world
[32:56] is going crazy even tonight in darkness
[32:59] as we heard this morning but there's a
[33:02] little bride that has a light the Star
[33:05] of Bethlehem is still shining bright the
[33:09] house is still full of God's bread the
[33:13] water is still clear there's still
[33:16] strength and and comfort in the presence
[33:20] of God Lord made tonight service be
[33:23] encouraging to the family at this time
[33:26] of the year when so many are together
[33:29] maybe with loved ones and family but we
[33:32] realize on this December 23rd Sunday
[33:36] evening when so many are canceling
[33:38] tonight's service but brother Tom
[33:41] brother
[33:42] Bisco felt to have this meeting I
[33:44] believe it's good Lord because there's
[33:47] many among us that we are their family I
[33:50] pray for them tonight that is who the
[33:53] service is reaching out for that you
[33:56] have not forgotten them those that labor
[33:59] among us throughout the year and maybe
[34:01] seem little or those that maybe are
[34:04] discouraged those that might be weary
[34:06] this is the reason for the service
[34:09] tonight I pray that you would bring it
[34:11] from a time of just a reproach and a
[34:14] hard time and turn it around and may
[34:18] there be new born faith may there be a
[34:21] freshness and an encouragement within
[34:23] the assembly that as we shout hallelujah
[34:26] praise the Lord and rejoice that the
[34:30] Holy Ghost could come to our souls could
[34:33] heal our bodies could cause our spirits
[34:36] to come to a rest and a Shalom that all
[34:39] is well Lord we praise you tonight God
[34:42] may the darkness of this Laodicea hour
[34:45] be split with the voices of angels and
[34:49] the sounds of singing and the glories to
[34:52] God would not be just words of music
[34:55] sang this time of year but may it be a
[34:58] revelation in our souls moving back
[35:01] Satan moving back the darkness moving
[35:04] back evil spirits that tonight service
[35:07] could be a time when you would come
[35:09] among us in a special way be born
[35:12] tonight within our lives in a new born
[35:14] faith in Jesus name Amen
[35:18] god bless you can have your seats amen
[35:23] nice to have brother Kyle and sister
[35:25] Christina you are a gift to us we love
[35:29] your family we dearly love you brother
[35:31] Kyle and well he could have spoke
[35:35] tonight but we're standing here hey man
[35:37] and Oh God's gifts always find their
[35:40] places tonight we want to take this
[35:42] thought under inspiration from reproach
[35:47] to new born faith and it comes from the
[35:51] message we have seen his star and come
[35:53] to worship Him
[35:55] brother branham spoke that after the
[35:56] seals in 63 he said a prophet or a seer
[36:00] don't go to sleep but he sees the angel
[36:04] standing there the other man just goes
[36:06] to sleep and he sees the angel talking
[36:10] about Joseph the angel said Joseph there
[36:14] isn't no riddle there's nobody there
[36:17] that can interpret it for you so I'm
[36:19] gonna tell you about it I'm gonna make
[36:22] it real to you because there's nobody
[36:24] there that can make it real don't fear
[36:27] to take Mary thy wife for that which is
[36:31] conceived in her is of the Holy Ghost
[36:34] and brother Branham said then when
[36:37] Joseph rose from his sleep oh how his
[36:41] heart must have been full of newborn
[36:44] faith that's where we get our title
[36:47] tonight newborn faith it was because God
[36:51] dealt with his life that mystery that
[36:54] had bothered him that something that he
[36:57] wanted to believe but that something
[37:00] that he dared to believe but it was so
[37:02] unusual yet was made known to him by a
[37:06] dream new faith sprung up into his life
[37:11] brother Brown said oh my he had faith in
[37:15] God he had faith in his wife then so
[37:20] before then it was a question before
[37:23] then it was a mystery before then he was
[37:26] a brother about in his 40s that was
[37:29] about ready to put away a teenage young
[37:32] lady in the message because this had
[37:34] never happened before that a virgin
[37:37] would conceive but from a moment of him
[37:40] putting her away to the next few moments
[37:44] he's embracing her as his wife you say
[37:47] what happened in between God dealt was
[37:49] his life and tonight we want to take you
[37:52] as a believer and put you into the story
[37:55] because we're all in a journey tonight
[37:57] and this message inand given your life
[38:00] to Christ many times there is a great
[38:03] reproach
[38:04] there's a great scorn and there's a
[38:06] great misunderstanding but tonight we
[38:09] want to leave that reproach and we want
[38:12] to turn to a newborn faith because
[38:15] Joseph came out of this experience with
[38:18] faith sprung up in his life he was
[38:21] already a righteous man he was already a
[38:24] just man so I'm not speaking about
[38:26] newborn meaning like a baby being born
[38:29] we're not talking about a baby in a
[38:31] manger and I'm not just speaking about
[38:33] the new birth this is something that
[38:35] happens to a believer that there's
[38:38] certain questions in your life or times
[38:40] of loneliness or times of fear or
[38:44] situations you find yourself in that God
[38:47] deals with our hearts with a newborn
[38:49] faith and something Springs out of your
[38:53] life but the Branham said he had faith
[38:57] in God he had faith in his wife then
[39:00] both faith in God and love for his wife
[39:03] and love and the one that he loved and
[39:05] there's no more question no more
[39:08] question about it he knew that was the
[39:11] angel of the Lord he knew that God had
[39:13] revealed to him just exactly the
[39:16] question that was in his mind so all the
[39:19] questions was gone I thought maybe if
[39:22] there's anyone here that has questions
[39:24] in your life the the angel of the Lord
[39:27] could minister to you tonight in God's
[39:30] gifts always find their places brother
[39:33] Branham said Joseph couldn't understand
[39:35] it it was just too unusual he was a good
[39:39] man nothing wrong with him he was a good
[39:43] man a just man but it was so unusual
[39:45] brother Branham said Joseph probably 40
[39:48] years old 45 something like that they
[39:51] claimed when he and Mary was engaged but
[39:54] here we find something that had never
[39:56] had happened a man espoused to this man
[40:00] sorry a woman espoused to this man and
[40:03] yet found to be with a mother it was so
[40:08] unusual Joseph was minded to put her
[40:10] away but right at that crucial moment
[40:14] God sent his angel
[40:17] and appeared to him in a dream and said
[40:19] don't fear to take to thee Mary thy wife
[40:22] for that which is conceived in her is of
[40:26] the Holy Ghost and brother Branham stops
[40:29] and he says what a newborn faith Joseph
[40:33] must have had when she rose up from
[40:36] there so he's already a believer he's
[40:39] already a just man where the brand said
[40:42] nothing wrong with Joseph but there was
[40:44] nothing wrong with Mary in fact tonight
[40:47] I wanted to bring before you it had
[40:49] never happened before that time and it's
[40:52] never happened physically since that
[40:54] time that a virgin would bring forth a
[40:58] child she went from bearing a reproach
[41:01] of people calling her a prostitute and
[41:04] don't even be near her and whoever she
[41:08] would bring forth with it would be an
[41:10] unclean saying - having a revelation
[41:13] this is of God and she didn't tear then
[41:17] what nobody thought and Joseph brother
[41:20] branham said when she rose up from there
[41:22] what a newborn faith he had see he never
[41:27] had need of any interpretation the dream
[41:30] wasn't in symbols it was right straight
[41:32] out don't fear to take Mary thy wife for
[41:36] that which is conceived in her is of the
[41:38] Holy Ghost
[41:39] there was no prophet to give the
[41:41] interpretation so it had to come
[41:43] directly right straight like that from
[41:46] God to Joseph
[41:48] God just bypass all the medium people
[41:52] tonight it's from God to the bride and
[41:55] there's gonna be a bride on the earth
[41:57] that does exactly what Joseph did when
[42:00] he heard the word he got right up and
[42:03] married Mary all the reproach was gone
[42:09] he went from putting her away privately
[42:12] and we don't want to embarrass her to
[42:15] marrying her openly saying I'm proud to
[42:19] be the father of the Messiah we're going
[42:22] to go into that just a little bit
[42:24] tonight I think it'll mean something to
[42:26] you so this word newborn let's just look
[42:29] at it for a little bit
[42:30] it means something fresh so coming from
[42:34] a reproach we'll talk about that in just
[42:37] a few minutes a reproach to a newborn
[42:40] faith means something fresh has happened
[42:43] in your experience something that a
[42:46] person already has but it was like
[42:49] something was reborn or born again it
[42:53] gives them a fresh start
[42:55] it gave Joseph fire to move forward it
[43:00] took all the questioned away about what
[43:04] God thinks about it and tonight maybe
[43:06] you've had a question maybe there's a
[43:09] question in your heart can any good come
[43:12] out of Nazareth or how could God do this
[43:16] in a teenager she's just a teenager in
[43:19] the message we're gonna go from little
[43:23] babies tonight to teenagers all the way
[43:26] up to men and women in their 80s Simeon
[43:29] and Anna so it doesn't matter your age I
[43:33] said it doesn't matter your age when God
[43:36] comes on the scene and when the
[43:38] supernatural takes place the bride
[43:41] responds to that and so no matter what
[43:43] is negative or bad in your life that's
[43:46] taken place no matter what scoffing and
[43:50] reproach that or scorn that you're
[43:53] bearing for the cause of Christ tonight
[43:55] God has given you strength by His Word
[43:58] you can bear that tonight you can stand
[44:01] the reproach of the word we're gonna
[44:05] look into the scripture and look at some
[44:07] examples in the message of men and women
[44:11] and believers that stood the reproach of
[44:14] the word in their day and it's so easy
[44:16] to look back and why that's wonderful
[44:19] and thank God for that so easy to look
[44:22] forward and say that's gonna be
[44:24] wonderful and that's gonna be good it's
[44:27] so difficult to look right where we're
[44:29] at but that's what we need to do tonight
[44:32] it's not looking back it's not just
[44:35] looking forward it's aimed this
[44:36] Christmas God give me a revelation God
[44:41] give one another and our family
[44:43] a revelation and I believe it would
[44:46] really lift our spirits and lift our
[44:48] hearts this Christmas may this service
[44:51] be a gift for some of you to know that
[44:56] we all are bearing a reproach at some
[44:59] level being a Christian is to be part of
[45:04] the minority we are a minority tonight
[45:08] so rather than taking that in the bad
[45:11] part it's good to look at the Christmas
[45:14] story and look at all of the ones that
[45:16] were faithful throughout that and say
[45:18] you know what they bore a reproach we're
[45:22] in the minority but rather than pulling
[45:25] the victim card turn it around and let
[45:28] it be a new born faith let something
[45:31] spring out of you like a freshness
[45:34] rather than looking at it it's so bad
[45:37] say thank you Jesus you've chosen my
[45:40] womb you've chosen my life you're
[45:43] looking at my situation I need a newborn
[45:47] faith Joseph was a good person Mary was
[45:54] a good young lady but this fresh start
[45:57] or this fire to move forward came after
[46:01] the angel appeared to them so when we
[46:05] speak about newborn tonight it's not
[46:08] speaking about just a baby being born or
[46:11] something being born like that like an
[46:14] infant but it's something that happens
[46:17] inside of a person to give them strength
[46:20] to give them vision it's something that
[46:24] happens in your journey you that have
[46:27] started out know what I'm talking about
[46:29] it's a newborn faith it's a vision and
[46:34] strength to move above the reproach
[46:38] let's go back to Psalms 89 together
[46:41] thank you brother Tom for having a
[46:43] Sunday night service so many churches
[46:46] are canceling tonight
[46:47] and it's so wonderful in the message
[46:51] that we have the family of God and to
[46:54] know that we're not alone
[46:57] take strength from services like this it
[47:01] means the ministry is not forgotten you
[47:04] we have not forgotten you
[47:07] we're here to stand with you some of you
[47:12] might not know but when we travel as
[47:14] ministers like we did last weekend
[47:16] there's times during a service during
[47:19] the meeting we'll give your testimonies
[47:21] without giving your name we'll speak
[47:24] about a young lady or a young man or a
[47:26] family in our church or a brother and it
[47:30] 100 percent of the time the people
[47:32] respond and are so happy praise the Lord
[47:36] and hallelujah and maybe even clap
[47:38] because they see that themselves when
[47:42] they hear the word or they hear a
[47:44] message and then when they hear a
[47:45] testimony it just triggers and something
[47:49] in their heart in their testimony that
[47:51] God's alive and if he can do that for
[47:54] them he can do that for us and it's like
[47:57] a newborn energy and faith comes through
[48:01] their lives that's what we need this
[48:03] Christmas in Psalms 89 verse 52 52 these
[48:10] few verses are verses that brother
[48:14] Branham read and a Christmas message 56
[48:18] years ago tonight December the 23rd 1962
[48:25] but the Branham preached the reproach
[48:27] for the cause of the word in
[48:30] Jeffersonville and he talked about how
[48:33] it's a very strange Christmas text but
[48:37] the Sunday before he had preached on the
[48:39] world falling apart and he says I want
[48:42] to speak on the reproach for the cause
[48:44] of the word and he read this scripture
[48:47] in Psalms 89 verse 50 actually had him
[48:50] read it again and repeated again
[48:53] remember Lord the reproach of thy
[48:55] servants how I do bear in my bosom the
[48:59] reproach of all the mighty people David
[49:04] is dealing with reproach where it could
[49:08] have been Ethan here and
[49:09] certain Psalm here the reproach verse 51
[49:14] where with thine enemies have reproached
[49:17] Oh Lord wherewith they have reproached
[49:21] the footsteps of thine anointed blessed
[49:25] be the Lord forevermore amen and amen
[49:29] a Christmas message on December the 23rd
[49:33] and brother Branham speaks this as a
[49:35] Christmas message on the reproach I have
[49:39] it here in front of me the reproach for
[49:41] the cause of the word I begin to look
[49:44] into that word of reproach means a
[49:46] reproached or to be reproached is like a
[49:50] disapproval to be disappointed to be the
[49:55] object of someone's disappointment to
[49:57] say I'm so disappointed in you
[49:59] hi we had such high thoughts and for
[50:05] your life and you are such a reproach to
[50:07] our family you are such a disappointment
[50:09] to your mother and I or to have a friend
[50:13] or a brother and sister a family member
[50:16] give you what the world would call a
[50:18] look of reproach means of disdain you
[50:21] look down on them it's like I'm putting
[50:24] up with you it's to be reproached is the
[50:28] word in the scripture is a thing that
[50:31] makes the failings of someone or
[50:33] something else more apparent or whenever
[50:37] you're around they're so convicted
[50:40] they're so condemned because whenever
[50:43] holiness is around it brings unholiness
[50:47] in a person another person to the
[50:50] surface and it makes it more apparent
[50:52] and it's like I just can't stand to be
[50:55] around you that's what a reproaches it
[50:58] could be in the family could be on the
[51:00] job or in the home some of you might
[51:03] experience it this week
[51:05] it's a disdain it's like a reproach is
[51:09] showing open district approval it can be
[51:13] like a disgrace or a discredit a source
[51:17] of shame to us or like a stain you're
[51:21] like a blot on
[51:23] family many believers have experienced
[51:26] that when they chose Christ did we not
[51:29] or embrace this message we realized that
[51:32] there's others that just don't see it
[51:34] the same as us and it causes a reproach
[51:37] I want to say this tonight and make it
[51:40] very clear to give your life to every
[51:42] Christ is to accept a reproach it's not
[51:48] an easy road and some of the elders
[51:53] should have could have been a little bit
[51:55] louder hey man we thought we thought it
[51:57] was gonna be so easy I thought if you
[51:58] gave your life to the Lord and we're in
[52:00] the Lord's army that this is gonna be a
[52:02] roar and a shout know many times you'll
[52:05] get more of disapproval there will be a
[52:09] discredit to you and a shame and a blot
[52:13] some of you've heard the phrase above
[52:15] reproach such as someone living above
[52:18] reproach that means there's no criticism
[52:20] that can be made of their lives but as
[52:22] believers we live in a land where we are
[52:26] reproached we are scorned we are
[52:28] criticized Jesus standing with Pilate
[52:32] and before those that were wanting to
[52:34] take his life didn't call a lawyer and
[52:37] he didn't try to use his cell phone or
[52:40] ask his disciples to get a lawyer he
[52:42] stood there like a lamb he was bearing
[52:45] the reproach they stripped off his
[52:48] clothes in shame it's like to be rebuked
[52:53] or reprimanded to be standing a reproach
[52:57] you're familiar with Isaiah 53 were the
[53:02] Bible prophesied of Christ and how there
[53:04] would be no beauty that we should desire
[53:06] him and the reason that I'm just
[53:09] speaking this for the next 2 or 3
[53:10] minutes is to let you know that if that
[53:13] was the bridegroom part and were the
[53:15] bride we're gonna bear it all so you can
[53:19] bear it we're not avoiding it this
[53:22] Christmas we're not pagans like the
[53:25] world but we're not gonna put off an
[53:28] opportunity to thank the Lord for coming
[53:31] but when he came there was no beauty
[53:34] that we would desire him he was despised
[53:36] and rejected of men a man of sorrows and
[53:39] acquainted with grief and we hid as it
[53:42] were our faces from him he was despised
[53:45] and we esteemed him not
[53:47] and if you join yourself with him you're
[53:49] gonna be despised you're gonna be
[53:54] smitten on people's going to take you
[53:57] wrong and we're going to get into that
[53:58] and a little bit about some results of a
[54:01] reproach or Consequences that we all
[54:03] should count as familiar but we're here
[54:06] on family night
[54:07] to let one another know that you've
[54:11] either gone through that you're going
[54:14] through that or you will experience it
[54:17] in the future the more you give your
[54:19] life to Christ it's not an easy road
[54:22] there is a reproach there is a cross I'm
[54:29] going to take it deep here and then take
[54:31] us from a reproach to newborn faith
[54:33] there is a cross but there is a crown
[54:36] there is an earth but there is a glory
[54:39] there is a natural body but there's a
[54:42] celestial body so I'm taking you now
[54:45] into this maybe seemingly negative or
[54:48] bad side so that by the end of the
[54:52] service we can go into a new born faith
[54:55] and say yes I have that but I have this
[54:58] the Bible says about Jesus he was
[55:01] despised and rejected and he bore our
[55:03] griefs carried our sorrows yet we did
[55:07] esteem him stricken smitten of God and
[55:10] afflicted he was wounded for our
[55:12] transgressions he was bruised for our
[55:15] iniquities the chastisement of our peace
[55:18] was upon him and with His stripes we are
[55:22] healed
[55:23] this Christmas received the gift of
[55:25] healing just receive it open it up
[55:31] spread back the wrapping hallelujah it
[55:36] might be unexpected you're gay you're
[55:38] being given a gift tonight just take it
[55:41] there might be deliverance in that
[55:43] package there
[55:44] be joy in that package there might be a
[55:51] gift of forgiveness in that package you
[55:53] came to the service thinking you're
[55:56] gonna be rejected and God has given you
[55:59] justification that's a gift don't reject
[56:04] the gift because of how you see yourself
[56:07] and your attitude and what you've done
[56:09] when the word is saying I forgive you
[56:14] this Christmas I'm justifying you and if
[56:19] a person receives that revelation what a
[56:22] newborn faith what a faith would come
[56:24] out of that it's like a person laying
[56:26] dormant and all of a sudden being
[56:28] energized quicken they would come out of
[56:32] that Jesus was oppressed and afflicted
[56:36] yet he opened not his mouth
[56:38] he is brought as a lamb to the slaughter
[56:41] and as a sheep before her Shearer's is
[56:43] dumb so he opened not his mouth he was
[56:48] taken from prison and from judgment wow
[56:50] this is a wonderful Christmas message
[56:52] isn't it a reproach I'm dipping down
[56:57] into the reproach a little bit this was
[56:59] the little baby that came that grew up
[57:01] and was giving his life that they want
[57:04] him in a bit in a manger where they can
[57:06] hold him and the bride is same but I
[57:09] want him I want to be married to him
[57:11] what do I need to do to get all the way
[57:17] he was taken from prison and from
[57:20] judgment who shall declare his
[57:22] generation he was cut off out of the
[57:24] land of the living for the transgression
[57:26] of my people was he stricken he made his
[57:29] grave with the wicked and with the rich
[57:31] in his death and it goes on to speak
[57:33] about how it pleased the Lord to bruise
[57:36] him he hath put him to grief seen the
[57:40] travail of his soul talks about how he's
[57:44] bearing our iniquities this is Isaiah 53
[57:48] therefore will I divide him a portion
[57:50] with the great and he shall divide the
[57:52] spoil with the strong because he hath
[57:55] poured out his soul unto death
[57:57] he was numbered with the transgressors
[57:58] and bear the sin of many and made
[58:01] intercession for the transgressors that
[58:04] was us
[58:06] that was all of us
[58:09] that was the reproach that came with
[58:12] bearing the name of Christ Lord this
[58:18] Christmas don't let us ignore what
[58:22] you're doing here clover to our Bible
[58:26] Way it's just the same as any other day
[58:29] people have looked back and they were
[58:31] looking back and looking at Isaiah and
[58:33] the priest was reading that in the
[58:34] temple and it was being read and then
[58:36] they missed him
[58:38] then people looking forward and what a
[58:40] day that's gonna be and it's gonna be
[58:42] wonderful when we get over yonder and
[58:44] then they ignore right in front of them
[58:47] the word that wants to be revealed and I
[58:51] say God this Christmas don't let us be
[58:54] so busy and distracted and worldly and
[59:02] caught up in the lights and the tinsel
[59:05] that we miss you miss you and our own
[59:09] lives miss you in one another amen don't
[59:15] let us make it a tradition and fail to
[59:18] see what God is doing
[59:20] can I speak about reproach a little bit
[59:22] more reproach too from a reproach to a
[59:27] newborn faith but a reproach is to be
[59:30] criticized to be reprimanded or blamed
[59:34] you are the one you always rain on our
[59:39] party you're never laugh at our jokes
[59:41] you you're all you never fit in and a
[59:45] real child of God
[59:47] it really hurts them but in their heart
[59:49] later they realize I don't fit in but
[59:54] rather than barren that as a man I just
[59:56] don't fit in what do I got to do to fit
[1:00:00] in take it as a newborn face tonight and
[1:00:03] say you know what God
[1:00:04] people have never fit in that's why God
[1:00:07] says I'm not gonna leave you here I'm
[1:00:09] gonna take you away hallelujah
[1:00:13] so when you are reproached and accused
[1:00:16] that means even scolded and rebuked you
[1:00:21] know you're not even in the message or
[1:00:24] you don't even believe in the Bible but
[1:00:26] in your heart you do for the Branham
[1:00:30] said a critical spirit will criticize so
[1:00:33] Paul and 2nd Timothy 3:12 I hope this is
[1:00:37] encouraging someone he said all that
[1:00:41] live godly in Christ Jesus shall suffer
[1:00:44] persecution that's just a wonderful
[1:00:47] Christmas message we'll all that live
[1:00:50] godly in Christ Jesus shall suffer
[1:00:53] persecution they don't want you they
[1:00:56] scoff at you they spit at you you're not
[1:01:00] part of the in-crowd and some of this
[1:01:03] persecution comes threefold number 1 it
[1:01:06] comes from the outside we're persecuted
[1:01:10] then there's a persecution from within
[1:01:12] and we know that bride don't persecute
[1:01:15] bride but there's still
[1:01:17] misunderstandings brother Branham
[1:01:19] preached on misunderstandings and he
[1:01:21] talked about that in questions even
[1:01:23] amongst us and things that go on all
[1:01:26] that live godly in Christ Jesus shall
[1:01:29] suffer persecution
[1:01:31] and lastly third because of decisions we
[1:01:34] make or choices that we make that are
[1:01:38] not necessarily us operating in God's
[1:01:41] perfect will it's called a personal
[1:01:44] persecution that we go through and I
[1:01:47] want to stand here tonight and say this
[1:01:49] as a believer you can go through all
[1:01:51] three of them when you receive
[1:01:56] persecution from without you can stand
[1:01:58] that when it happens from within and
[1:02:02] misunderstandings you just make sure
[1:02:04] you're the one that is spiritual and has
[1:02:07] the Spirit of Christ and lastly when
[1:02:11] there's decisions and choices that are
[1:02:13] made in your life or in your family or
[1:02:16] in your career whatever in your
[1:02:18] experience and it shows that you haven't
[1:02:21] walked in God's perfect will and then
[1:02:23] there's persecution or there's a maybe a
[1:02:26] comeback from that you can stand that
[1:02:28] you can go through that none of these
[1:02:32] persecutions are excuses enough for a
[1:02:35] believer to throw in the towel
[1:02:39] hallelujah in this season in this hour
[1:02:45] in this rapture change season that the
[1:02:49] bride is going through a reproach for
[1:02:52] the word I want to encourage you tonight
[1:02:54] stand stand for the word and when you've
[1:03:00] done all to stand just keep standing and
[1:03:03] when it seems like the storms 2018 was a
[1:03:07] storm
[1:03:08] maybe field year for you but you're
[1:03:12] still standing you've bore it hallelujah
[1:03:22] I'm speaking tonight on standing the
[1:03:24] reproach of the word but that means
[1:03:26] bearing it you can bear it in the
[1:03:29] university in the college in the school
[1:03:33] you can bear the reproach you can be the
[1:03:37] one believer that makes it in the
[1:03:39] rapture out of that hellhole in your
[1:03:43] family when there's others that are in
[1:03:45] denominations or other people that are
[1:03:47] just totally worldly or when there's
[1:03:51] people within that say they believe but
[1:03:53] they act at certain times in maturely or
[1:03:57] inappropriately that's no reason for you
[1:04:00] to fall apart
[1:04:01] you just keep standing you just keep
[1:04:05] being Christ this is December 23rd and a
[1:04:09] prophet priests the reproach for the
[1:04:12] cause of the word
[1:04:13] I think that's an encouragement 56 years
[1:04:16] later that we can stand the reproach of
[1:04:19] the word and the cause of Christ are we
[1:04:23] together tonight let's go to Luke
[1:04:25] chapter 2 as we get in
[1:04:27] to the story further it's good to look
[1:04:38] at believers in the scripture and see
[1:04:41] them in their real life struggles this
[1:04:44] wasn't easy for Mary and Joseph I mean
[1:04:49] who in this building has ever brought
[1:04:50] forth a child without knowing a man if
[1:04:55] you're a sister I mean if you're a
[1:04:56] brother that has a family when was the
[1:04:59] last time you could say we had a family
[1:05:01] and we you know there wasn't anything
[1:05:03] natural to it it was just a supernatural
[1:05:05] thing it's all supernatural but I'm
[1:05:07] speaking about Isaiah a virgin shall
[1:05:09] conceive it had never happened so we
[1:05:14] have someone in our youth group a
[1:05:16] teenager that comes up pregnant
[1:05:21] everybody's quiet I'm talking about Mary
[1:05:25] and Jesus pure and his virgin and his
[1:05:30] holy and no one believes her in fact
[1:05:37] when she's sharing this with Elizabeth
[1:05:39] which was an elder sister and remembers
[1:05:42] that Cariah this is all this whole story
[1:05:45] I don't want to say story that it's not
[1:05:47] true a fiction but the whole thing
[1:05:49] surrounding Christmas ought to be
[1:05:51] edifying to the believer these are
[1:05:53] believers Mary Joseph
[1:05:56] Zechariah Elizabeth Simeon and Anna it's
[1:06:01] like knowing those that made it in the
[1:06:03] ark it's always very few each one of
[1:06:07] them had a reproach um all of a sudden
[1:06:12] an angel appears in Zechariah about his
[1:06:16] ministry and he doesn't believe it how
[1:06:20] could it happen to my wife were we're in
[1:06:23] our elder years and and God smote him
[1:06:27] dumb can you imagine a minister being
[1:06:30] dumb and I'm not talking mentally I'm
[1:06:32] speaking he cannot talk he cannot talk
[1:06:35] he that's that's his way of carrying out
[1:06:38] his duties and
[1:06:40] from that time he was dumb he couldn't
[1:06:44] speak yet right on the tablet he bore a
[1:06:47] reproach just like we Solon Thursday
[1:06:50] night it's like talk to me talk to me
[1:06:52] and he's just writing on a tablet come
[1:06:55] on talk to me it was like it used to be
[1:06:56] able to do this and now you can't do
[1:06:59] that what a reproach and they'd laugh at
[1:07:02] him he was a believer he was a believer
[1:07:08] Elizabeth was a believer but yet in her
[1:07:11] womb was a something that hadn't moved
[1:07:14] for months and she's talking to a
[1:07:17] teenager in the church and and the
[1:07:19] teenager says this is what's happened oh
[1:07:21] but you didn't invite me to the to the
[1:07:23] wedding are you and Joseph are married
[1:07:25] and no no we're not married and how can
[1:07:29] these things be and an angel appeared to
[1:07:32] me and she's just given her testimony
[1:07:36] and Elizabeth wants to believe it had
[1:07:39] never happened before but here's now
[1:07:41] Mary talking to this elder in the church
[1:07:45] sister Elizabeth and she wanted to
[1:07:47] believe but as soon as she got to the
[1:07:49] name his name shall be called Jesus all
[1:07:53] of a sudden something moves inside of
[1:07:55] Elizabeth something that had been dead
[1:07:57] or not moving
[1:07:59] a newborn faith struck it it was there
[1:08:06] but it came alive the promise was there
[1:08:10] remember the angel said you're gonna
[1:08:12] bring forth a son his name's gonna be
[1:08:14] John but it had been laying there with
[1:08:17] no life but at the sound of the name of
[1:08:20] Jesus I wonder if we can say Jesus
[1:08:23] tonight Jesus something move from death
[1:08:27] to life wouldn't that be wonderful that
[1:08:31] happened tonight say all brother John
[1:08:33] you said let's all say Jesus no at the
[1:08:34] name of Jesus it is but they all bore
[1:08:43] reproach they all Boris coughing it's
[1:08:48] like how can these things be now let's
[1:08:51] look here in in Luke chapter
[1:08:54] to verse 21 I think a week or two ago
[1:08:57] two weeks ago we read some of this I'm
[1:09:00] gonna go back in a few minutes to
[1:09:01] something brother Michael Ray spoke on
[1:09:03] and this is where this whole message
[1:09:05] stemmed from Luke 2:21 and when eight
[1:09:09] days were accomplished for their
[1:09:11] circumcising of the child his name was
[1:09:13] called Jesus which was so called of the
[1:09:17] angel Luke 2:21 before he was conceived
[1:09:22] in the womb and when the days of her
[1:09:26] purification which was eight days if you
[1:09:29] look back to Leviticus 12 verse eight
[1:09:31] the days of her purification according
[1:09:34] to the law of Moses were accomplished
[1:09:36] they brought him to Jerusalem to present
[1:09:37] him to the Lord as it is written in the
[1:09:40] law of the Lord every male that openeth
[1:09:42] the womb shall be called holy to the
[1:09:43] Lord verse 24 and to offer a sacrifice
[1:09:47] according to that which is said in the
[1:09:49] law of the Lord a pair of turtledoves or
[1:09:52] two young pigeons and if you remember in
[1:09:54] Leviticus 12 you could bring a lamb and
[1:09:58] if you were poor like a peasant you
[1:10:00] could bring a turtle doves Mary was poor
[1:10:04] so hearing this message reproach for the
[1:10:08] cause of the word brother branham said
[1:10:10] what a reproach to Mary what a reproach
[1:10:12] to Mary and Joseph for his word he
[1:10:16] starts talking about how the scorn how
[1:10:19] they lifted up their eyebrows when they
[1:10:21] seen little Mary go by said to Joseph
[1:10:24] you're marrying a prostitute and
[1:10:26] remember brother adultery was death in
[1:10:28] them days to get her from being killed
[1:10:32] he's talking about what how Joseph was
[1:10:34] thinking to put her away privately but
[1:10:37] remember all the time God was dealing
[1:10:39] with them it was according to the word
[1:10:41] and they didn't know it a virgin shall
[1:10:43] conceive and Joseph looked and before
[1:10:47] the angel had visited him he said well I
[1:10:50] love her but I'm a righteous man and I
[1:10:52] can't marry a woman like that and the
[1:10:55] angel of the Lord appeared in to him in
[1:10:57] a dream and said don't fear to take unto
[1:11:00] thee Mary thy wife for that which is
[1:11:02] conceived in her is of the Holy Spirit
[1:11:04] Oh
[1:11:05] oh what a comfort would you agree the
[1:11:10] word brings comfort I want to say in
[1:11:13] 2018 9 to Christmas the bride needs
[1:11:17] comfort the Lord Jesus is our comforter
[1:11:20] the Holy Ghost is our comforter and may
[1:11:24] you receive it tonight receive comfort
[1:11:27] tonight in this busy stressed caught up
[1:11:32] world there's no one that brings the
[1:11:38] smile to his face like you as his wife
[1:11:41] walking into the room saying I love you
[1:11:44] Jesus and Mary on her road to the well
[1:11:49] the little virgin about 17 18 years old
[1:11:52] I'm quoting brother Branham 1718 married
[1:11:55] to a man that had been married before
[1:11:57] and had four children as an old man
[1:11:59] talking about Joseph a it was a widower
[1:12:02] he was older and she loved him and she
[1:12:06] didn't know why and he loved her and she
[1:12:09] didn't know why they didn't know why but
[1:12:15] tonight we know why because Joseph was
[1:12:19] of the house and lineage of David why
[1:12:24] was it Mary because she was a teenager
[1:12:27] that had kept herself pure God could
[1:12:32] have trust in Mary that she wasn't going
[1:12:34] to give in to the reproach and the peer
[1:12:37] pressure God said I want a teenager that
[1:12:40] I can trust that'll take me at my word
[1:12:43] that in spite of family friends whoever
[1:12:48] she was gonna stand on the Word of God
[1:12:51] she's standing in line with her little
[1:12:54] turtledoves and everybody has their
[1:12:56] lambs because they're more well often
[1:12:59] this is the Messiah and the mother and
[1:13:05] father are so poor they just have a
[1:13:07] turtle death for an offering I don't
[1:13:12] want to digress but some of us would
[1:13:14] miss apply and misunderstand
[1:13:17] back then or even today when the
[1:13:20] scripture says if you can't provide for
[1:13:23] your family you're worse than an infidel
[1:13:25] let me bring to your mind that when
[1:13:28] Jesus was born God Almighty
[1:13:31] couldn't even provide a room for him he
[1:13:34] was born in a stable he couldn't provide
[1:13:37] a bed for him he was born in a manger he
[1:13:41] had no blue blanket or no nice garment
[1:13:44] it was a teenager reaching up and
[1:13:46] grabbing swaddling cloths that was
[1:13:48] hanging over and that wrapped the lovely
[1:13:52] Lord Jesus
[1:13:53] that's Almighty God I would say very
[1:13:56] well he provided for his children do you
[1:14:00] agree tonight I mean is there anyone
[1:14:02] that's gonna accuse God of not providing
[1:14:04] he provided everything last Sunday night
[1:14:12] in Edmonton there was a sister that sang
[1:14:14] a special and I'm forgetting the words
[1:14:17] exactly but I'm paraphrasing I have no
[1:14:20] complaint to God after all he's done
[1:14:24] after all these years I have no
[1:14:27] complaint can we say that tonight after
[1:14:31] all he's done after all he's been and
[1:14:34] we've gone through I have no complaint
[1:14:36] about fifty percent of you I gotcha
[1:14:40] we have no complaint say but what about
[1:14:43] there so what about that you're
[1:14:45] describing the reproach you're talking
[1:14:47] about the cross you're talking about
[1:14:49] finances or or your bad health or you're
[1:14:53] talking about somebody misunderstood
[1:14:56] that's the reproach but tonight we're
[1:15:00] speaking about from reproach to a
[1:15:02] newborn faith we're talking about God
[1:15:05] doing something for you or for me in a
[1:15:07] moment of question in a moment of a
[1:15:10] misunderstanding in a moment when we
[1:15:12] don't know what to do God comes on the
[1:15:14] scene she's bearing a reproach standing
[1:15:21] in the in the temple a teenager and no
[1:15:24] one was rallying for her no one shook
[1:15:27] her hand as she went in and said go for
[1:15:29] it
[1:15:29] Mary I know you were a virgin you can do
[1:15:33] this he's the Messiah not a person she's
[1:15:36] standing on she's standing in the line
[1:15:38] because it's according to the word and
[1:15:40] everybody's saying don't even go near
[1:15:42] her and and the scoffers were there and
[1:15:45] and brother Branham says I wonder how
[1:15:48] little Mary felt I know we like sermons
[1:15:52] way up in the clouds here's a prophet
[1:15:55] I wonder how Mary felt probably about
[1:15:59] the way you've have failed in your life
[1:16:03] probably there's times in your life
[1:16:06] since you've given your heart to the
[1:16:08] Lord you felt like Mary did but the
[1:16:10] bottom said did you ever think of that I
[1:16:14] wonder if she felt scared he said and
[1:16:21] the scoffers were saying things and she
[1:16:24] came to the day of the dedication and
[1:16:26] all the women were keeping their
[1:16:28] distance and here she came up with the
[1:16:30] baby walking up with the baby and all
[1:16:32] they had their little fine needlework to
[1:16:34] dedicate their babies and nearly all of
[1:16:37] them pulling a lamb and she had two
[1:16:39] little turtle doves cleansing for her
[1:16:41] own purification the little baby wrapped
[1:16:44] in swaddling cloth made out of the yolk
[1:16:47] of a back of an ox's neck that was this
[1:16:52] swaddling cloth in the manger they had
[1:16:57] nothing for him they was too poor and
[1:17:01] here she stood I'd like to just take a
[1:17:09] real knock at that devil tonight that
[1:17:11] says you have to be wealthy and you have
[1:17:14] to have a lot of money and you have to
[1:17:17] be at a certain status I think we need
[1:17:21] to take a good whack at him sometimes
[1:17:22] and say I have Jesus that's sufficient
[1:17:28] but you don't have a nice blanket Mary I
[1:17:31] love Jesus you're a prostitute I know
[1:17:37] you were playing around you thought you
[1:17:40] all goody two-shoes and religious and
[1:17:42] you're nothing but somebody that you're
[1:17:46] living a lie and brother branham said
[1:17:49] she was poor but she just stood I would
[1:17:53] encourage you tonight stand on the Word
[1:17:56] of God no doubt he said all the women
[1:18:01] kept their distance from the little
[1:18:03] virgin see she's got an illegitimate
[1:18:05] child brother branham said see how God
[1:18:09] makes things so radical looking he pulls
[1:18:12] the wool over satan's eyes they were
[1:18:15] saying filthy dirty adultery she's an
[1:18:17] adulteress listen here that didn't stop
[1:18:21] that beat in little Mary's heart I pray
[1:18:26] the Lord Jesus will turn up the volume
[1:18:28] of Revelation tonight no matter what
[1:18:32] they're saying no matter what you're
[1:18:33] hearing condemnation you're bad you're a
[1:18:36] bad mother
[1:18:37] you're a bad daddy you're a bad provider
[1:18:40] just keeping on you the scorn and the
[1:18:44] mockery oh if we should have only done
[1:18:46] that and oh if you would have only dad
[1:18:48] but it didn't stop that beat in Mary's
[1:18:51] heart I'm here for my purification they
[1:18:56] kept their distance they're calling her
[1:18:59] Holy Roller fanatic but Mary knew whose
[1:19:03] baby that was hallelujah and the bride
[1:19:07] knows what we're carrying that it wasn't
[1:19:10] us that did this it wasn't us it was the
[1:19:14] angel that said to us
[1:19:15] you're the Bride of Christ I just
[1:19:18] believe the Angels say what are you
[1:19:21] doing standing there tonight what are
[1:19:22] you doing I'm standing because of the
[1:19:26] voice of an angel and from that time
[1:19:31] there's been a newborn faith there's
[1:19:36] been a freshness there's been an energy
[1:19:39] there's been a fire
[1:19:41] and this is what I pray this Christmas
[1:19:43] take it from being a sermon now right
[1:19:45] down to family time this is what I pray
[1:19:47] would happen to every single person and
[1:19:49] we desire for our children and for our
[1:19:51] spouses and one another and visitors and
[1:19:59] just at that time when everything is
[1:20:02] just silent and the scorn is just heavy
[1:20:04] on her all of a sudden comes hallelujah
[1:20:08] praise God hallelujah what is that noise
[1:20:12] it's Simeon come bursting into their
[1:20:14] mockery party father scuffing and
[1:20:17] mockery

[1:20:21] that had a revelation
[1:20:23] that's the Messiah I tell you something

[1:20:32] that brother look at that

[1:21:39] Lord saying I see the Spirit of God

[1:21:46] righteous man and you're not gonna die

[1:26:17] us or there's only five as it was in the
[1:26:24] days of Noah God dealt with them they
[1:26:27] were in harmony they got together and
[1:26:29] when Simeon came in there with a little
[1:26:32] baby was I'm still quoting he'd never
[1:26:34] heard nothing about it but here was the
[1:26:37] baby and Simeon sitting in the room and
[1:26:40] the spirit fell on him hallelujah didn't
[1:26:47] say saw the star
[1:26:48] he didn't give gold he didn't have it to
[1:26:52] give but he had a revelation he didn't
[1:26:57] know nothing about those things but the
[1:26:59] Spirit of God fell on him and said move
[1:27:01] out Simeon and here he went walking not
[1:27:04] knowing where he was going
[1:27:06] like Abraham he was seeking something he
[1:27:08] didn't know where it was at but he just
[1:27:11] kept moving maybe some of us were just
[1:27:13] kind of walking not knowing which way to
[1:27:15] go I don't know if it's this way I don't
[1:27:17] know if it's that way but I want to be
[1:27:19] moved by the spirit leave me Lord and
[1:27:22] I'll follow lead me out there and he
[1:27:25] said the Spirit of God fell on him and
[1:27:28] all at once he stopped and the Holy
[1:27:31] Spirit Monster said there he is there he
[1:27:37] is he reached over into Mary's arms took
[1:27:44] up the baby in his arms and looked up
[1:27:46] and said Lord let thy serve it now
[1:27:49] depart from this life in peace my eyes
[1:27:52] is looking at your salvation hallelujah
[1:27:57] he was looking with different eyes
[1:27:59] everybody else's scoffing mocking don't
[1:28:02] I don't want to be around
[1:28:03] Simeon walks right up here where's this
[1:28:05] baby if I could just touch this child
[1:28:09] you're all calling it you don't want to
[1:28:11] touch it you don't want to even look at
[1:28:12] Mary Simeon walks right into the
[1:28:15] scoffers and the mockers it's the same
[1:28:19] today they don't want your Jesus
[1:28:23] they want your innocence they want your
[1:28:26] purity they want your sound mind and
[1:28:30] we'll give them as much as we can make
[1:28:33] it through this life but our heart is
[1:28:35] the Lord's the very thing everyone was
[1:28:42] making fun of and the women was shunning
[1:28:45] Simeon said it's your salvation and
[1:28:49] about that time here comes the old blind
[1:28:52] woman wine and her way through
[1:28:53] staggering through the crowd she comes
[1:28:55] up prophesize oh my let you'd say give
[1:29:00] us a positive testimony Anna say
[1:29:03] something good do you all know what she
[1:29:05] said a sword shall pierce your heart but
[1:29:13] it'll reveal I'm reading brother
[1:29:15] branham's words here quoting Luke 2:35 a
[1:29:18] sword shall pierce their heart but it'll
[1:29:20] reveal the thoughts of many hearts oh
[1:29:23] you say mary had to look through the
[1:29:26] reproach and the sharpness of the word
[1:29:30] and the sword and say wow if that's
[1:29:37] going to reveal the hearts of many and
[1:29:40] this is your salvation but the Brenham
[1:29:44] said what was it I guess some of those
[1:29:47] woman said now look that see what kind
[1:29:49] of class it is that old woman cracked in
[1:29:52] the head there he is over there standing
[1:29:54] before that prostitute girl trying to
[1:29:56] say a thing like that that a
[1:29:57] illegitimate child
[1:29:59] old Anna sets there half starving
[1:30:02] herself to death fasting and they were
[1:30:10] saying starving herself to death going
[1:30:12] on like that she she don't have any fun
[1:30:15] like we do look at Mary she don't have
[1:30:20] no fun like all of us do look at Anna no
[1:30:24] she was about her father's business she
[1:30:27] was a bearing a big reproach some of you
[1:30:32] are beautiful tonight
[1:30:34] you bear a reproach you bear the scorn
[1:30:38] you bear the cross let's turn to Matthew
[1:30:42] chapter 1 let's turn back to Matthew
[1:30:53] our family evenings almost done it's
[1:30:56] almost finished but look Matthew 1:18
[1:31:00] again that the few verses after Matthew
[1:31:03] 1:18 how many paradoxes are in these few
[1:31:06] verses speaking about from a reproach to
[1:31:12] a newborn faith just from Matthew 1:18
[1:31:15] the birth of Jesus Christ was on this
[1:31:17] wise when as his mother Mary was
[1:31:21] espoused or engaged to Joseph before
[1:31:24] they came together she was found with
[1:31:28] child of the Holy Ghost that was a
[1:31:30] miracle then Joseph her husband he say I
[1:31:35] thought they were just a spouse I I
[1:31:37] thought they were just engaged this is
[1:31:40] how serious engagement is Joseph her
[1:31:44] husband being a just man and not willing
[1:31:47] to make her a public example was minded
[1:31:50] to put her away privately or privately
[1:31:54] he's not going to make it a big thing in
[1:31:56] the church he's embarrassed it's like
[1:32:00] how could my lovely engaged how could
[1:32:05] she do that and I'll just put her away
[1:32:07] privately it's not going to be a big
[1:32:10] thing but while he thought on these
[1:32:13] things while you're thinking on these
[1:32:17] things while you've been praying about
[1:32:20] God's will for your life and what you
[1:32:22] should do in Joseph's case the angel of
[1:32:28] the Lord appeared unto Him in a dream
[1:32:30] Saint Joseph so it's not vague and it's
[1:32:33] not about someone else and this person
[1:32:36] it's you I'm speaking to you now son of
[1:32:39] David fear not to take unto thee Mary
[1:32:41] thy wife she's your wife for that which
[1:32:46] is conceived in her is a tell you what a
[1:32:48] revelation if God would give that to a
[1:32:51] young man tonight and say that is your
[1:32:53] wife don't forget an angel can talk to
[1:32:56] her too so if it's got on one side it'll
[1:33:02] be God on the other these things are
[1:33:05] like paradoxes
[1:33:06] verse 23 we see a virgin shall be with
[1:33:10] child you say it's impossible you say it
[1:33:14] can happen but it fulfills Scripture a
[1:33:17] virgin shall be with child and shall
[1:33:19] bring forth a son and thou shalt call
[1:33:23] his name Emmanuel which being
[1:33:25] interpreted is God with us now verse 24
[1:33:28] when Joseph being raised from sleep did
[1:33:32] as the angel of the Lord had bidden him
[1:33:35] would you agree he got the revelation
[1:33:38] and took them to him his wife and knew
[1:33:43] her not until she had brought forth her
[1:33:45] firstborn son and he called his name
[1:33:47] Jesus our time is almost finished
[1:33:51] tonight but this is really the heart of
[1:33:53] the message a few weeks ago brother
[1:33:56] Michael Ray spoke on the token and spoke
[1:33:59] about Rahab the harlot and how she bore
[1:34:04] the reproach and how long it was from
[1:34:08] the time of the scarlet cord being in
[1:34:10] the window until her and her family was
[1:34:14] actually brought out it wasn't the next
[1:34:16] day it wasn't three days if you look
[1:34:18] from Joshua to all the way to Joshua 6
[1:34:22] it talks about the days and the weeks
[1:34:24] and the Passover then they crossed over
[1:34:27] Gilgal they had Passover they ate of the
[1:34:30] old corn of the land the manna stopped
[1:34:32] they had seven days of circling around
[1:34:35] Jericho up to April 23rd it's right
[1:34:38] there in the Bible until Jericho was
[1:34:41] destroyed and then Rahab and her family
[1:34:43] in Joshua 6 22 to 25 and all that she
[1:34:47] had was saved it was at least 15 days
[1:34:52] over two weeks that Rahab allowed that
[1:34:58] token scarlet cord to be in the window
[1:35:01] she was scoffed she was mocked it was a
[1:35:05] test but she stood the reproach
[1:35:07] everybody said look at that scarlet car
[1:35:11] look at that token
[1:35:12] look at that but down in her heart that
[1:35:14] was her safety I wonder if you would
[1:35:19] have the same revelation it's not just
[1:35:22] the next day or a week later no she kept
[1:35:25] it there and when everything else is
[1:35:28] being destroyed Rahab's house was
[1:35:30] standing hallelujah you say oh that's
[1:35:34] good for Rahab no it was good for the
[1:35:36] spice because God was confirming that
[1:35:40] it's not just Moses it's not just Joshua
[1:35:43] I'm gonna use the words of two brothers
[1:35:45] in the church and whatever they say is
[1:35:50] as good as my word and when everything
[1:35:53] else failed
[1:35:54] there's her house standing Joshua never
[1:35:58] said that it was two spies two brothers
[1:36:02] that believed the message hallelujah two
[1:36:04] men that kind of Revelation that
[1:36:07] whatever I say God will back it up
[1:36:09] you'll lay your hands on the sick they
[1:36:12] shall recover
[1:36:13] not just brother branham not just the
[1:36:15] pastor but now men and women operating
[1:36:19] how many you remember this morning Rahab
[1:36:22] walked out of there as a prostitute but
[1:36:26] she married Salman and brought forth a
[1:36:30] son that was right in the lineage of
[1:36:32] Jesus Christ all the scorn all the
[1:36:35] reproach of a mockery of years and years
[1:36:39] and years God was stamping the whole
[1:36:42] thing
[1:36:43] the spies Rahab and her family by saying
[1:36:48] I'm gonna bring my son my life right
[1:36:50] through that lineage y'all know where he
[1:36:53] was born in Bethlehem it's incredible
[1:36:57] this the cold Christmas story comes back
[1:37:00] to the token comes back to reproaches
[1:37:03] comes back to men and women and
[1:37:06] Bethlehem is the house of God's bread
[1:37:08] it's the staff of life it was the water
[1:37:12] capital where fresh water comes it was
[1:37:15] the well of Bethlehem that that David
[1:37:18] when he well you remember when the
[1:37:20] Philistines were garrisoned about that
[1:37:21] he
[1:37:22] I wanted some of that water and Men
[1:37:24] jeopardize their lives where are those
[1:37:27] men today
[1:37:28] that'll bear the reproach bear the scorn
[1:37:32] and say I'll fight my way through to
[1:37:36] bring you a fresh drink and he poured it
[1:37:38] out on the ground
[1:37:39] well the carnal mind would say what a
[1:37:41] waste and what are you doing pouring
[1:37:43] that on on the ground it's all speaking
[1:37:49] of Christ it's all men and women that
[1:37:52] when you look at it all just like us
[1:37:56] then I just take it a little further
[1:37:59] results of reproach many times leads to
[1:38:03] crying your hearts broken hurt feelings
[1:38:11] things that are against and there's a
[1:38:13] struggle and you're given one side and
[1:38:15] there's someone else on another side and
[1:38:17] there's a struggle and you're left with
[1:38:20] a reproach like a burden it's like
[1:38:22] really many times it's opposite
[1:38:26] differences of opinion and thoughts and
[1:38:29] mind they clash and your life that
[1:38:35] you're scorned you're looked on as being
[1:38:39] the one that's wrong and in air so they
[1:38:42] alienates you they separate from you
[1:38:46] we've mentioned scoffers that Peters
[1:38:49] talked about scoffers and mockers but
[1:38:51] you're given a bad name from that time
[1:38:53] on when you make that stand you're given
[1:38:56] a bad name you're reproached and you're
[1:38:59] made fun of or something bad happens to
[1:39:03] you and they used to be your friend or
[1:39:05] your brother or sister now they're like
[1:39:07] ah it's because of that ah ha ha the
[1:39:10] Bible says friends and family may leave
[1:39:15] you're called oddballs but I want to
[1:39:20] encourage you tonight it's not all about
[1:39:22] the reproach it's about a new born faith
[1:39:26] where God will come back around to you
[1:39:29] and give you a freshness I just read
[1:39:33] some scripture I wish I had more time
[1:39:34] but
[1:39:35] it was when Joseph realized that he's
[1:39:38] going to put away this beautiful lady
[1:39:42] that he was engaged to in brother
[1:39:46] Branham said no doubt but she rehearsed
[1:39:49] all of this to Joseph and Joseph was
[1:39:52] wondering and said the stems of it I'm
[1:39:54] engaged to if it is the way it is and
[1:39:59] she's been with someone else she should
[1:40:02] have been ravished she should have been
[1:40:05] stoned according to Deuteronomy 22 by
[1:40:08] the venoms saying the penalty of that
[1:40:10] but now she's to be mother not married
[1:40:14] and Joseph it seemed like that Mary was
[1:40:16] trying to get him to be her shield from
[1:40:19] the scoffers and scorners Joseph was to
[1:40:22] be her shield and to go ahead and marry
[1:40:25] her and be her shield he was to be a
[1:40:30] shield he wanted to believe her I really
[1:40:33] believe that he said he wanted to
[1:40:35] believe her but her story was so unusual
[1:40:38] it was hard for that believer to believe
[1:40:40] and he said so it is today the power of
[1:40:45] the Holy Ghost upon the earth today in
[1:40:47] the church is so unusual but it's the
[1:40:53] truth and the Bible said while he was
[1:40:57] thinking on these things he was a good
[1:40:59] man and he didn't want his own name
[1:41:01] marred and yet he knowed if that woman
[1:41:04] was that way he couldn't marry her she
[1:41:06] was to be a mother by another man that
[1:41:09] innocent little woman her life has been
[1:41:12] so pure as a lily and I want to believe
[1:41:15] her and I don't know what to do while he
[1:41:17] thought on these things here I want to
[1:41:19] bring it down to this tonight while he
[1:41:21] thought on these things and was minded
[1:41:23] to put her away privately he said I
[1:41:26] don't want to cause any great
[1:41:28] disturbance about it remember he had
[1:41:31] never taken the oath yet but yet he was
[1:41:33] espoused he was going to put her away
[1:41:35] privately while he was thinking on these
[1:41:37] things to the best of his knowledge he
[1:41:43] said he was a just man a good man he
[1:41:45] said brother sister let me say this if
[1:41:48] you are justice
[1:41:49] you're honest in your heart God is
[1:41:51] obligated to reveal the thing to you I'm
[1:41:55] glad we came to church Sunday night just
[1:41:59] be honest in your heart and God will
[1:42:02] reveal it to you and Joseph being a just
[1:42:05] man pondering these things how can these
[1:42:08] things be no doubt he sat and prayed he
[1:42:11] studied it in the scriptures how could
[1:42:13] this be and the angel of the Lord
[1:42:15] appeared to him he goes on to talk about
[1:42:20] some of his thoughts and how he's just
[1:42:23] praying lord I come through the lineage
[1:42:25] of David Jehovah God I'm a righteous man
[1:42:29] I'm trusting in you my beloved little
[1:42:31] sweetheart
[1:42:32] I'm a spouse to her I'll put her away
[1:42:36] I'm if I take her than I'm guilty
[1:42:39] she's to be mother and I don't know what
[1:42:41] is these things Lord she didn't know if
[1:42:44] she had told the truth it was all an
[1:42:47] unusual story and unusual happening and
[1:42:52] then the voice came Joseph thou son of
[1:42:58] David fear not to take unto thee Mary
[1:43:01] thy wife remember already his wife for
[1:43:05] that which is conceived in her is of the
[1:43:07] Holy Ghost God sent his angel and
[1:43:11] revealed that his revelation came to
[1:43:14] Joseph and there was no mystery in it he
[1:43:20] said Joseph there isn't no riddle I'm
[1:43:22] gonna make it real to you coz there's
[1:43:24] nobody can make it real don't fear to
[1:43:26] take Mary thy wife for that which is
[1:43:28] conceived in Arizona the Holy Ghost and
[1:43:30] when Joseph rose from his sleep
[1:43:32] oh how his heart must have been full of
[1:43:34] newborn faith that mystery that had
[1:43:37] bothered him something that he wanted to
[1:43:39] believe something that he dared to
[1:43:42] believe was so unusual yet it was made
[1:43:44] known to him by a dream new faith sprung
[1:43:48] up into his life he said oh my he had
[1:43:52] faith in God he had faith in his wife
[1:43:56] maybe you need faith for your husband
[1:43:58] faith for your wife
[1:44:00] - no a job to take her what direction to
[1:44:04] go trust God
[1:44:09] you might be thinking one way but God
[1:44:12] can speak to you and it be totally
[1:44:13] opposite he's wanting to put her away
[1:44:16] privately and God says no you take her
[1:44:22] said I'm gonna make it real to you and
[1:44:25] new faith sprung up into his life he had
[1:44:29] faith in God he had faith in his wife
[1:44:31] then both faith in God and love for his
[1:44:34] wife and love to the one that he loved
[1:44:35] there's no more question no more
[1:44:38] question about it he knew that was the
[1:44:40] angel of the Lord he knew that God had
[1:44:42] revealed to somebody need a revelation
[1:44:44] tonight let the angel of the Lord just
[1:44:49] come by your way would that be wonderful
[1:44:55] there's a sister that gave a testimony I
[1:44:58] heard it the other day she had cysts in
[1:45:00] her body she didn't want to make a big
[1:45:03] thing about it didn't put in a prayer
[1:45:04] request didn't tell her people she just
[1:45:06] had cysts in certain parts of her body
[1:45:08] she went up for prayer someone prayed it
[1:45:14] was a minister a visiting minister she
[1:45:17] went back home and the next morning she
[1:45:18] realized the sister gone there's no more
[1:45:22] sis she's given testimony to God that's
[1:45:25] our kind of a God tumors just fall off
[1:45:29] right there on your seat there you're
[1:45:31] back to straight right now you say what
[1:45:33] struck me the angel of the Lord came by
[1:45:36] if you talk about him he'll come around
[1:45:39] tomorrow and Tuesday just speak about
[1:45:42] Jesus welcomed him in how many would
[1:45:49] love for the question just to leave all
[1:45:51] the turmoil and you're going into this
[1:45:53] and all of us it's just gone it's just
[1:45:56] like peace just and the Bible says I can
[1:45:59] imagine sorry brother Branham said I can
[1:46:02] imagine how Joseph felt when that taken
[1:46:04] place the mystery was all over and when
[1:46:07] this was done he was found rejoicing
[1:46:10] hallelujah he was happy till then your
[1:46:14] your kind of clouded over you're bearing
[1:46:15] a reproach you're saying why me why us I
[1:46:20] thought we had the revelation and
[1:46:23] something bad happened but after God
[1:46:26] speaks and after God confirms it then
[1:46:29] you can rejoice then he said he was
[1:46:32] happy and we find out right away he
[1:46:35] married her no more question he took him
[1:46:38] marry the wife and knew her not as a
[1:46:40] wife until the child he said happy about
[1:46:42] it he was glad to be marry shield he was
[1:46:47] glad to bear her reproach now I'm not
[1:46:51] talking about just you but when you get
[1:46:53] a real revelation you're able to bear
[1:46:55] others reproaches people around you and
[1:46:59] what they're going through I pray that
[1:47:05] we wouldn't become just an old starchy
[1:47:07] Church as we get older you say I've been
[1:47:10] there I've done that but there's others
[1:47:12] that are going through things they need
[1:47:13] us to bear with them and they're going
[1:47:16] through times of reproaches when they
[1:47:18] feel like running - and they feel like
[1:47:20] going - just like you did that's the
[1:47:24] time we need to bear one another's
[1:47:25] reproach after this revelation Joseph
[1:47:28] could stand and say I'll be her shield
[1:47:33] you don't have to stand all alone Mary
[1:47:35] I'll be there with you
[1:47:38] anybody have anything to say talk to me
[1:47:41] okay I'll talk to you look at this woman
[1:47:44] no an angel appeared to us he said when
[1:47:49] a man can have it revealed that Jesus
[1:47:51] Christ is the same yesterday today and
[1:47:53] forever no matter how many creeds turn
[1:47:55] against it
[1:47:56] you're good you're glad to be a shield
[1:47:58] you're happy to be a shield let them say
[1:48:01] whatever this week let them say whatever
[1:48:08] but you got a big shield there to knock
[1:48:11] the fiery darts off you're happy to be a
[1:48:13] shield you're a doormat this is a
[1:48:18] wonderful way to close a Christmas
[1:48:19] message
[1:48:20] he said you're a doormat whatever it
[1:48:24] wants to be it doesn't matter it's been
[1:48:26] revealed to you by the Lord the Lord has
[1:48:30] showed it to you by his word it's the
[1:48:32] truth and confirmed it to you and made
[1:48:35] it live again you say there it is you
[1:48:39] know what that's when we say there it is
[1:48:42] let's stand tonight what a super sign
[1:48:46] what a super message there's room in the
[1:48:50] end Lord come by this in give us gifts
[1:48:55] this Christmas of forgiveness gifts of
[1:48:59] healing gifts of deliverance I pray for
[1:49:02] your homes there'd be gifts of joy and
[1:49:05] if there's no joy there you be the joy
[1:49:08] you say there's no peace in the
[1:49:10] situation you bring the peace for the
[1:49:13] jury I wrote it right down here a
[1:49:15] peaceful atmosphere bring a gift this
[1:49:18] year I wish I could give you a thousand
[1:49:23] dollars but my presence is my present
[1:49:26] yeah and everybody goes no bring peace
[1:49:30] bring joy bring a smile on your face
[1:49:34] hallelujah we could all use that
[1:49:36] sometimes and isn't it amazing that even
[1:49:41] balaam a prophet that went out of the
[1:49:45] way could prophesy of Christ in numbers
[1:49:48] 24:17 he said I shall see him but not
[1:49:52] now I shall behold him but not nigh
[1:49:54] there shall come a star out of Jacob and
[1:49:58] a scepter shall rise out of Israel he
[1:50:01] prophesied of Christ when they wanted
[1:50:04] him to see the hind ER parts of the
[1:50:06] church and the hind ER parts of the
[1:50:08] message he could only prophesy of Christ
[1:50:12] III have nothing good to but good to say
[1:50:15] I think that's good it's coming from a
[1:50:19] time of reproach into a new born faith
[1:50:22] as we bow our heads tonight
[1:50:24] I wonder tonight if the Holy Spirit
[1:50:29] could put his arms around individuals
[1:50:31] can play something brother Ryan
[1:50:34] wonder if the Holy Spirit is here as we
[1:50:37] come together in the congregation as
[1:50:42] we've seen over the years not everyone
[1:50:45] can bear this reproach
[1:50:49] not everyone can stand the reproach of
[1:50:51] the word they cave in they give in to
[1:50:59] the pressure they back up they stop
[1:51:04] fighting the reproach is too much
[1:51:10] the laughing what they said about you on
[1:51:15] the internet what they're emailing
[1:51:17] pictures you see and it brings a
[1:51:19] reproach and you feel laughed at and
[1:51:23] you're hurt say how can this be then the
[1:51:29] Holy Spirit comes behind it starts to
[1:51:33] minister to your heart then the angel of
[1:51:37] the Lord comes by your way you're my
[1:51:42] daughter you're my son
[1:51:48] maybe the service tonight wasn't for
[1:51:50] everyone maybe there's some tonight
[1:51:53] tomorrow Tuesday you have a lot of
[1:51:55] family you have a lot of maybe even
[1:51:57] believers maybe there's moms and dads
[1:51:59] and brothers and sisters cousins and
[1:52:02] aunts and uncles and grandpas and
[1:52:03] grandmas but maybe there's a few in our
[1:52:07] family that really needed the service
[1:52:10] tonight to let them know that it's not
[1:52:15] all about the reproach but this
[1:52:19] Christmas he wants to give you a new
[1:52:22] born faith to bring back the new again
[1:52:28] bring back the freshness
[1:52:32] to where you're not just talking about
[1:52:34] it and hearing sermons and going through
[1:52:37] the motions but an angel of the Lord can
[1:52:41] come by your ways and by the time he's
[1:52:46] done the questions our time
[1:52:50] the mystery about it all you rise up
[1:52:56] like Joseph and you're willing to go out
[1:53:00] there and do the exact opposite what you
[1:53:04] felt in you in your own heart was the
[1:53:06] right thing to do
[1:53:07] but the Lord Jesus when he comes he
[1:53:10] inspires you to do something so sacred
[1:53:15] so divine they laughed at the wise men
[1:53:20] they scoffed at him for coming these
[1:53:22] whole years months away from your
[1:53:25] business away from your family your wife
[1:53:27] your children your church two years
[1:53:33] where are you going they pass their
[1:53:37] Jerusalem and all the preachers and all
[1:53:39] the charts and all the people that
[1:53:41] should have known better they were lied
[1:53:45] to by Herod brother Branham talks about
[1:53:49] how the people in the streets laughed at
[1:53:52] them where is he that is born King of
[1:53:56] the Jews where is he that is born King
[1:54:00] of the Jews
[1:54:01] but the bomb said they laughed at them
[1:54:04] but when they stepped out of that spirit
[1:54:07] the star appeared again and led them all
[1:54:11] the way to the little house the little
[1:54:14] child that had grown up now from a baby
[1:54:18] now a little child the same Jesus the
[1:54:24] same Lord and they gave gold
[1:54:28] frankincense and myrrh
[1:54:32] again reproached scoffed at lied to if
[1:54:39] they gave and they worshiped I wonder
[1:54:41] who would want to worship this Christmas
[1:54:43] with your gift with your gift Here I am
[1:54:47] Lord Jesus like the Shepherd's I'm
[1:54:50] coming to this place because an angel of
[1:54:54] the Lord the seventh angel has appeared
[1:54:58] in our generation
[1:55:01] Heavenly Father let us respond 100% let
[1:55:06] us bear the reproach and if there's some
[1:55:09] in our church and our spiritual family
[1:55:11] that need a newborn faith made tonight
[1:55:15] be the start bring it all back new again
[1:55:20] appear to them Lord Jesus cause the
[1:55:24] message to come alive cause the
[1:55:27] Scriptures to become a new book I pray
[1:55:31] for them Jesus we pray for one another
[1:55:36] we give of our time we give of our
[1:55:39] energy we give of our money we diff for
[1:55:41] one another can we give our faith to one
[1:55:44] another and say we are gonna bind
[1:55:46] together in this great time of reproach
[1:55:50] Heavenly Father many raise their hands
[1:55:53] throughout the service and at the end
[1:55:55] now some have lifted up their hands you
[1:55:58] know every heart you know every life you
[1:56:01] know every situation wise men and wise
[1:56:05] women are still seeking for the Messiah
[1:56:07] whether it's a baby in a manger whether
[1:56:10] it's a little child whether it's a a
[1:56:12] teenager whether it's a man on the
[1:56:15] Jordan River whether it's a man hanging
[1:56:17] on the cross saying my God my God why is
[1:56:20] our forsaken me or whether it's 2018 the
[1:56:28] same message reproached scoffed and
[1:56:31] mocked looked down on but may that
[1:56:34] newborn faith rise out of our assembly
[1:56:37] out of our families out of the
[1:56:39] individuals that are fellowshipping God
[1:56:42] and may the Holy Ghost fall on them as
[1:56:45] you did Simeon move like you did Sir
[1:56:49] Joseph Mary from teenagers all the way
[1:56:53] up to Anna the elder ones let them be
[1:56:57] encouraged this Christmas
[1:56:59] that you have not forgotten them they
[1:57:02] are not alone
[1:57:07] we pray that you would send that angel
[1:57:09] by their address by their need if it's
[1:57:15] physical if it's in the spirit realm if
[1:57:19] a devil has haunted their soul I pray
[1:57:22] this year this season this time even
[1:57:25] tonight there would be a light as you
[1:57:29] ministered even recently here an arrow
[1:57:33] of your presence come shooting down into
[1:57:35] that blood cell and loose them Jesus
[1:57:41] that they could see even their
[1:57:43] frankincense or even their myrrh shows
[1:57:47] what they feel of Christ we accept that
[1:57:52] doesn't always have to be gold it
[1:57:55] doesn't always have to be frankincense
[1:57:57] another person may give another gift and
[1:58:00] have another expression Lord Jesus we
[1:58:06] want to see more of you among us we want
[1:58:09] to see more of these gifts manifested
