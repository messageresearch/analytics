[11:35] just lift it up before him as we go to

[11:43] you together, Lord, spirit and in truth,
[11:46] Lord. lifting up our hands. Our hearts
[11:48] are open. So grateful for this place we
[11:51] can come into and let off the pressure
[11:54] to know that your Holy Spirit's already
[11:56] been leading and guiding and preparing
[11:58] us for this day. Lord, your words of
[12:01] eternal life that will flow into our
[12:03] souls to give us answers to deliver us.
[12:06] We want to praise you, God. We want to
[12:08] lift up your name. We want to bless you,
[12:11] God. And Lord, you've made all the rough
[12:14] places smooth, all the high places low.
[12:17] You prepared us, God, from our before
[12:19] our birth, Lord, to be sons and
[12:21] daughters and to rise in this rapturing
[12:24] faith, God. So every need, we lift up
[12:27] our hands in a total surrender,
[12:29] believing that you're conscious. You're
[12:31] aware of it, Lord. We want our faith to
[12:33] be believing. All things are possible.
[12:36] All things are possible, Lord. There's
[12:39] nothing too far for you or too hard for
[12:42] you, God. So we just believe, Lord, that
[12:44] you're in the midst of your children
[12:46] today. May you, Lord, in great power and
[12:50] great demonstration, in simplicity, God,
[12:53] come to our souls. Come to our spirits,
[12:56] Lord. Come to our bodies, Lord. Let
[12:58] there be a total healing. Let every
[13:00] prayer be answered, God, according to

[13:12] through this service. Lord, take away
[13:14] all unbelief, all the shackles of fear
[13:17] and doubt and skeptical. Lord, would
[13:20] just leave. Lord, the people as we are

[13:33] you, the resurrection morning. May you
[13:36] come through every life. Take all
[13:39] nervousness away, Lord. All the looking
[13:41] around or looking to our flesh, Lord.
[13:44] We're looking unto Jesus. We're humbling
[13:47] ourselves to one another, Lord,
[13:49] realizing we all have needs. We all have
[13:52] areas in our lives that we need the
[13:54] supernatural. So, would you just take
[13:57] total control? And we believe that
[13:59] you're going to speak today in a
[14:01] supernatural way. Lord, we're thanking
[14:04] you for the answer. We're thanking you
[14:06] for the dealings of the Holy Ghost
[14:08] already preparing, God, and we're ready.
[14:11] May you win the battle and win the
[14:14] victory in every life. We love you,
[14:16] Jesus, and we praise you and we thank
[14:19] you, God. Let our hearts be together now

[21:08] ready at this time. Just as soon as
[21:11] they're done, we'll turn the service to
[21:13] our pastor and you can come and speak
[21:15] what the Lord has laid on our hearts. I
[21:17] trust it's like going to the
[21:18] refrigerator.
[21:20] You know, you need something that's
[21:22] inside the fridge. You're not quite sure
[21:24] what it is. And when you open it up,
[21:26] something inside calls to what's in
[21:28] there. And it says, "That's what I'm
[21:30] craving." And we've come that way this
[21:32] morning. Open hearts. Lord, we're coming
[21:34] to the service. I have a need. I have
[21:37] something that I'm craving inside me.
[21:39] We're looking to you to supply that
[21:41] need.
[21:42] &gt;&gt; Amen. We'll just come with open hearts
[21:43] this morning. Just one more quick
[21:45] announcement before they sing. How many
[21:48] brothers and sisters have been able to
[21:50] help at BCA? Build build BCA. Why don't
[21:53] you stand up so we can recognize you
[21:54] this morning? You've just done a little
[21:56] something. If you've put your shoulder
[21:58] all the way to the wheel, I know there's
[22:00] Where's Brother Kim Dingwall? He's got
[22:02] both shoulders against the wheel. He's
[22:04] got both feet digging into the ground.
[22:06] Brother Peta, Brother Mark, I know many
[22:09] of you have done so, so very much. And
[22:11] we so appreciate that. Can we give him a
[22:13] round of applause?
[22:16] Don't sit down yet. Don't sit down. I
[22:18] know it's Don't sit down yet. Don't sit
[22:20] down.
[22:22] For the rest of us brothers, and I'm
[22:25] physically sitting down, it doesn't look
[22:27] like it. We can get behind them and we
[22:31] can help them. Do you believe that?
[22:33] &gt;&gt; I believe it. The rest of us brothers
[22:34] that are still sitting down and
[22:36] comfortable in our chairs, they need
[22:37] help.
[22:39] &gt;&gt; The school still needs to be built.
[22:41] &gt;&gt; And I confess, I commit. I'm on camera.
[22:44] I'm in front of you. I will be there. I
[22:46] will help. I have a camp to to run, too.

[22:54] you this morning.
[22:56] Amen. We certainly appreciate all that's
[22:58] gone into the the efforts of the school.
[23:01] I believe in September there's a very
[23:03] strong possibility we can have our
[23:05] children in the school. And I think
[23:07] that's just a wonderful, wonderful
[23:08] thing. God bless you this morning as you
[23:10] enjoy the special.
[23:13] [Music]

[23:44] and cannot carry on.

[24:59] lives fall like grave.
[25:03] Their love that once was burning bright,
[25:07] now covered by their pain.
[25:11] So let us go and take the light to them
[25:15] that are afraid
[25:19] and carry forth the word to those
[25:23] longing to be saved.
[25:28] Not a one

[31:55] &gt;&gt; Good to be in the house of God.
[32:00] Last Sunday, uh, my wife and I were away
[32:03] and for about 3 4 days and visiting her
[32:08] brother and sister, Sister Dorothy
[32:11] McGown, who many of you know and uh uh
[32:15] her brother is 88 years old and
[32:19] moving him from a home where he lived
[32:22] for over 60 years
[32:24] uh into an apartment and Uh, of course
[32:28] she's been Sister Ruth has held on to
[32:33] him in her heart of faith for salvation.
[32:37] And uh, that's what we just continue to
[32:40] establish our testimony.
[32:43] Eternity is a long time. Fact is, it's
[32:45] not even a long time. It's forever.
[32:48] &gt;&gt; And so, whatever we can do down here,
[32:51] &gt;&gt; we better do it now.
[32:53] &gt;&gt; Do you agree?
[32:54] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[32:55] &gt;&gt; Amen. Well, this is Mother's Day. Is
[32:58] this Mother's Day? We have a lot of
[33:01] mothers.
[33:03] And I'm glad that we do or I wouldn't be
[33:06] here.
[33:07] &gt;&gt; Neither would you.
[33:10] We have our mothers to honor and be very
[33:13] thankful. Brother Brennham spoke about
[33:17] spoke a message actually uh Mother's Day
[33:21] and I just thought that I would like to
[33:23] read some of his comments.
[33:26] He said, "Mother's Day should be every
[33:28] day.
[33:29] &gt;&gt; Not just to send a bunch of flowers on
[33:32] Mother's Day, but to love her and care
[33:35] for her 365
[33:38] days and nights through the year."
[33:42] The commercial world has
[33:45] uh a great hold on in things like this
[33:48] and it depreciates mother.
[33:53] &gt;&gt; It depreciates mother. You might uh not
[33:56] understand that but if you don't just to
[33:58] buy a piece of just to buy a few flowers
[34:01] and take it over can depreciate mother
[34:05] because if that may be replacing
[34:07] something else we should be doing. And
[34:09] he goes on to say
[34:12] she'd appreciate a whole lot more
[34:15] just to sit down and talk to her just a
[34:19] little bit. Write her a line. Pat her on
[34:23] the shoulder, kiss her on the cheek,
[34:26] tell her you love her. It'll it'll go a
[34:30] lot further than all the flowers that
[34:32] you could buy from the florist.
[34:37] Some of us can't do that. Our mothers
[34:39] aren't here. Our mothers are gone. Our
[34:41] mothers are far away, but you could call
[34:44] or write or say something.
[34:47] Then he refers to the the film by Cecil
[34:50] uh De Mills, The Ten Commandments,
[34:54] and he said that he'd seen it, the the
[34:56] film The Ten Commandments, and he said a
[34:59] little remark always stuck with him
[35:03] after Moses had found out that he was a
[35:06] Hebrew
[35:07] and he decided to dwell with his people.
[35:11] And there sat his once beautiful mother,
[35:14] faded out with her gray hair and her
[35:16] wrinkled face, sitting in an old
[35:19] armchair, a typical mother.
[35:22] And and Pharaoh's daughter came in and
[35:25] Moses said, "Who son am I?"
[35:29] And when it was brought to light that
[35:31] Jacobed, Jockabed was his real mother,
[35:35] the daughter of Pharaoh with her paint
[35:37] and so forth and all fixed up. She said,
[35:40] "But look, he may be your son, but she
[35:45] said, I gave him wealth and splendor.
[35:49] You could have you you could give him
[35:52] nothing but the slime pits."
[35:55] But the aged gay-haired mother said,
[35:58] "But I give him life."
[36:02] And that makes the difference. I gave
[36:05] him life
[36:06] &gt;&gt; and God gave him eternal life.
[36:10] He said, "How true."
[36:13] &gt;&gt; He said, "I want to take his theme."
[36:15] Brother Brandham was taking a theme on a
[36:17] subject and he said, "And take another
[36:20] picture of what mother is." He said,
[36:22] "Most every message has got something
[36:26] about the resurrection.
[36:29] It's the cardinal resting place of the
[36:32] gospel. If he did not rise again from
[36:35] the dead, then all of us was in vain.
[36:39] He said it's the crowning of our
[36:41] consolation, the resurrection.
[36:44] I think it's the great coronation of the
[36:46] full gospel is the resurrection and the
[36:49] divine promises and the consolation that
[36:52] it gives those who are trusting in it.
[36:55] For it promises the great union of our
[36:58] uniting together again.
[37:01] It gives us the promise that someday
[37:04] that these old, weakening, feebled,
[37:08] gay-headed, broke down mothers will be
[37:11] changed. Not only will mother sit there
[37:14] by herself, but all of her family with
[37:18] her. And what a day that will be.
[37:21] &gt;&gt; And I would just like to add this
[37:23] scripture. All things are possible to
[37:26] them that believe.
[37:28] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[37:28] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[37:31] It's irrelevant to me what the state of
[37:34] the family is. But what is relevant is
[37:37] what is the mother believing.
[37:39] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[37:41] &gt;&gt; Mother's love is very powerful and
[37:43] strong.
[37:45] And he says, "And what a day that will
[37:48] be. What a time it will be when we look
[37:51] upon the faces of those who we have
[37:53] loved so well. What a difference on that
[37:56] morning when we shall see our loved ones
[37:59] and to watch what they'll be. Then all
[38:02] the affliction will be taken away. All
[38:05] the mars of suffering will be done. No
[38:08] more pale cheeks of death. No more tears
[38:12] from the eyes. The resurrection
[38:14] promises. all of this.
[38:18] &gt;&gt; When we see them standing yonder, our
[38:21] loved ones, our mothers, our kindreds,
[38:23] all of our friends, and to see them in
[38:26] their immortal bodies, their celestial
[38:28] bodies. Listen, friends, that ought to
[38:30] send shivers right down through our
[38:32] entire being that this is the reality.
[38:36] &gt;&gt; It's not the reality is not sitting here
[38:38] on a Sunday morning. The reality is here
[38:41] hearing the words of a prophet and speak
[38:44] about the time that is to come. That's
[38:46] the reality.
[38:49] &gt;&gt; Is it a reality to you?
[38:52] &gt;&gt; And their celestial bodies watching
[38:54] their character, seeing how they conduct
[38:57] themselves with the sweetness and
[38:59] quietness. No more nervousness or
[39:02] flusterations. You've had them this
[39:04] week. We all have. You won't have them.
[39:07] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[39:08] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. There's another gathering
[39:10] time. That's why we're here.
[39:13] &gt;&gt; Amen. To prepare for that time.
[39:17] &gt;&gt; To see them standing in the likeness of
[39:19] the Lord Jesus. That'll be a wonderful
[39:21] day. And each one of us in our minds are
[39:25] anticipating and longing for that hour
[39:27] of consolation when we meet them. Each
[39:30] one is thinking of their loved one.
[39:33] Maybe their mother that's gone on. And
[39:36] what a day it'll be when we see her
[39:39] again. And to dad and to brother and to
[39:43] all the loved ones, what a day it will
[39:46] be.
[39:47] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. That's why I stand behind
[39:49] the pulpit this morning because that's a
[39:52] reality.
[39:53] &gt;&gt; And he said the the almost every message
[39:56] has the resurrection in it.
[39:59] &gt;&gt; Praise God.
[40:01] &gt;&gt; Praise God. Praise God.
[40:03] &gt;&gt; I say praise God. Amen.
[40:05] &gt;&gt; He's greater
[40:07] &gt;&gt; than every demon force.
[40:09] &gt;&gt; He's greater than the deceiver.
[40:11] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[40:11] &gt;&gt; He's greater than the powers of hell
[40:14] &gt;&gt; that bind the souls of man. He's greater
[40:18] than that deceiver who tries to attract
[40:20] the young people. My God is greater.
[40:24] &gt;&gt; Calvary is greater.
[40:27] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[40:28] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[40:29] &gt;&gt; He's greater than any darkness.
[40:32] He's greater than any other ambition.
[40:35] &gt;&gt; Yes, he is.
[40:36] &gt;&gt; God knows how to turn people around,
[40:38] folks.
[40:39] &gt;&gt; And we need to believe that.
[40:41] &gt;&gt; Greater is he that's in you than he
[40:43] that's in the world.
[40:45] &gt;&gt; Who is it that he Who is he referring to
[40:47] he in the world?
[40:49] &gt;&gt; Satan.
[40:50] &gt;&gt; Greater is he that is in you.
[40:53] &gt;&gt; We must believe that.
[40:55] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[40:56] &gt;&gt; Well, I'm not preaching yet, but we're
[40:57] working up to it.
[41:00] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Isn't that wonderful?
[41:04] &gt;&gt; And I'm glad for this. I'm glad for the
[41:06] school
[41:07] &gt;&gt; and the teachers
[41:08] &gt;&gt; and what has been happening. I'm glad
[41:10] for it.
[41:11] &gt;&gt; I'll tell you why. Because it's uh if
[41:14] there's any time that goes on, we have a
[41:16] future. We have and and they are that
[41:20] future. We have some that are teenagers
[41:23] and in a short time they're going to be
[41:26] 18, 19, 20 perhaps and entering into
[41:28] married life and whatever more. We have
[41:31] children and I just want to speak about
[41:34] the the progress of the of the school
[41:37] for a moment and I'll tell you why I'm
[41:38] burdened. It's not just another
[41:40] building. It is not that. But the
[41:42] progress of the school has been
[41:44] absolutely remarkable and it is largely
[41:47] remarkable because of uh brother Kim
[41:50] Dingwall and the time that he has given.
[41:53] He has given himself unreservedly to
[41:55] that work and I think the congregation
[41:57] knows that and
[41:59] [Music]
[42:08] and there's much that isn't known. It's
[42:11] all the negotiation and uh doing
[42:15] everything that he can to get
[42:16] everything. Uh my wife and I speak about
[42:19] it quite often that he's the right the
[42:22] right person. No one else could do it
[42:24] just like that because he has the right
[42:26] character and the right type of approach
[42:28] to people and where someone else might
[42:31] be confrontational he achieves uh better
[42:34] things than greater things. uh just the
[42:37] other day, in fact, is they just uh
[42:39] dropped off this last week the entire
[42:43] uh wiring system, the uh I should say
[42:46] the breaker system for all the electrics
[42:48] in the entire building. And it was his
[42:51] thought to have it all come into one
[42:53] location
[42:55] uh and uh and the brothers have been
[42:57] engaged in it. But when he called the
[43:00] head man of square D and there they
[43:03] build some of the best there is. in fact
[43:05] is I think they are the best and these
[43:07] huge huge this is several feet high and
[43:11] several feet wide
[43:14] and the the total cost of those is to
[43:17] buy them is $54,000.
[43:20] and he called this man. He says, "We're
[43:22] on another charity project and because
[43:25] he had done some up in in Alberta in
[43:27] Edmonton and uh asked him, you know,
[43:30] what he could do, do his best. Well,
[43:32] that's not enough." And finally, the man
[43:35] is just I won't say exasperated, but he
[43:38] said, "You know, what do you want me to
[43:40] do?" And finally, we got those $54,000
[43:44] worth of switch gear for $18,000.
[43:48] Uh that's just oneird of the I don't I
[43:50] know they can't build it for that price.
[43:53] So we want to thank God first and that's
[43:56] just one of many many it just happens
[43:58] all the time but there's and and Ben uh
[44:02] Dingwal has given his time and I don't
[44:05] know just how this is going to work out
[44:07] but he's just there every day and I
[44:09] don't know I he he can't have his other
[44:11] job. They must have fired him a long
[44:13] time ago. and brother Gil Ashdown. He
[44:16] just retired from Finning Tractor and
[44:19] I'm so glad he retired because we hired
[44:22] him right away and we're going to pay
[44:24] him in the rapture.
[44:28] And so many others have been coming on a
[44:30] regular basis and
[44:32] uh brother Mark Powell has been been
[44:35] there. I think that's his his uh second
[44:37] job. And uh I can't begin to mention all
[44:41] that have been there, but I would like
[44:43] those that have uh worked at the school.
[44:47] I don't care if you've only been there
[44:48] half a day, but those that have been at
[44:50] the school and and the sisters that have
[44:53] cooked or cooked at home and
[44:54] contributed, sent something in. I'd like
[44:56] you just to stand for a moment if you
[44:59] would do that, please. The young people,
[45:01] have you been there? They had a
[45:03] professional uh day the other day at the
[45:06] school and uh the school was shut down,
[45:09] but they had all the young people go
[45:11] over and I think that was just
[45:12] wonderful. Uh I want to say to all of
[45:16] you, thank you. And for those that
[45:19] haven't had opportunity to go there, I
[45:23] would encourage you to take a day and uh
[45:27] give some time. I'll tell you why. I
[45:30] think that if we really put an effort to
[45:32] it, listen to me now, I believe we can
[45:35] make it by September.
[45:37] &gt;&gt; Now, that's asking for another miracle,
[45:39] but why not ask for a miracle? And if
[45:42] you have any time, uh, you could
[45:45] certainly do that. Now, you that are
[45:47] standing and you that are sitting, I
[45:50] realize that some are not able to be
[45:52] there. You're some distance away. And
[45:55] this isn't to embarrass anybody, but I
[45:57] just want to say something to you. The
[45:59] children that are going to be go to that
[46:01] school according to this book, God's
[46:05] holy word,
[46:07] their angels
[46:09] are constantly before the face of
[46:12] almighty God.
[46:14] They're before the face of God. And if
[46:17] and if God would see that we are so
[46:19] concerned and we are so interested that
[46:22] we are seeking to have a place where
[46:26] they can be under the atmosphere of Holy
[46:29] Ghost teachers,
[46:31] &gt;&gt; an atmosphere of people who pray,
[46:34] &gt;&gt; people who believe this message, just to
[46:36] have them in that atmosphere. What
[46:38] they're going to do, what those young
[46:39] people are going to do, we don't know.
[46:41] But we know one thing. We're
[46:42] contributing.
[46:44] &gt;&gt; Contributing to their upbringing. Amen.
[46:46] &gt;&gt; God bless you each one as you have your
[46:48] seats. We appreciate it and we would
[46:51] just like to encourage you to do
[46:53] everything you can. Every spare moment
[46:55] you say, "Well, we're I know that some
[46:57] are getting burned out. I know I told
[47:00] Brother Peter, I think I I saw him there
[47:03] yesterday again. I think he lives there.
[47:07] Every time I go there, he's there.
[47:10] I don't know when he works, but it's
[47:11] it's uh Yeah.
[47:14] You think that it's just another
[47:15] building? No, it's not. No, it just
[47:17] isn't. It isn't another building. It's
[47:19] the only place. If you knew, I'm not
[47:22] able to tell you, but if you knew what
[47:25] some of these people have gone through
[47:28] and are going through, just to see that
[47:31] their children can be in that
[47:33] atmosphere, it humbles me and causes me
[47:37] to want to do everything that I can to
[47:40] have them there. It's no, it's no
[47:42] feather in my hat at all. I love the
[47:46] young people and the children and I
[47:49] think those blessed innocent lives
[47:51] deserve the best.
[47:53] &gt;&gt; I I I really
[47:57] Oh,
[47:59] this is going on internet. But I tell
[48:01] you what, I drove past a school here
[48:05] when one of my daughters had to be in
[48:08] that school and there they all around in
[48:10] a little bit of a huddle and little we
[48:13] teeny boppers and puffing on their
[48:16] cigarettes.
[48:18] I just slammed on my brakes, threw my
[48:21] door open and ran across the street. And
[48:23] I tell you what, I skinned those kids
[48:26] and they turned white. And I think I was
[48:29] probably white, too. It says, "Be angry
[48:33] and sin not."
[48:34] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[48:34] &gt;&gt; And I was angry at the devil.
[48:36] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[48:37] &gt;&gt; I was angry that those kids were getting
[48:39] trapped in that kind of a thing. And how
[48:42] I would love to see that they don't have
[48:44] to be in that kind of an atmosphere. And
[48:46] everybody here ought to support that
[48:48] 100%.
[48:50] &gt;&gt; You want to have them hear their old
[48:52] filthy stories and cursings and going I
[48:55] I'd say we ought to do everything in our
[48:57] power to see that their ears aren't
[49:00] subjected to that.
[49:02] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[49:04] &gt;&gt; Well, so much for that.
[49:08] I wonder if we can sing. I am amazed
[49:10] that he loved me.
[49:12] &gt;&gt; Can we help me out, would you? But
[49:17] &gt;&gt; let's stand up, shall we?
[49:21] That he loved me.
[49:29] Heat. Heat.
[49:39] Yeah.
[49:42] Heat.
[49:45] [Applause]
[49:45] [Music]
[49:52] Heat. Heat.
[49:54] [Music]
[50:06] Heat. Heat.
[50:18] I for
[50:39] [Music]
[50:42] how do we thank you?
[50:45] How do we bring our offering to you?
[50:48] &gt;&gt; How do we bring our praise to you, oh
[50:50] God? We just pray that you will look
[50:52] upon our hearts and see what's in our
[50:54] hearts, Lord. How we desire to lift you
[50:57] up. How we desire to make the name of
[51:00] our Lord Jesus Christ known. All glory,
[51:04] all hail the power of Jesus' name. Let
[51:08] angels prostrate fall. Bring forth the
[51:12] royal diadem and crown him Lord of all.
[51:17] Glory be to your name. Be glorified now
[51:20] in the words that are going to be
[51:22] spoken. Be glorified, oh God, in the
[51:25] hearts of your people. For the kingdom
[51:28] of God is here represented amongst your
[51:30] children. We pray, Father, you'll anoint
[51:33] your people, anoint your word, forgive
[51:35] us for any wrong that we have done. May
[51:38] we be washed and cleansed and holy
[51:40] before you in Jesus Christ's name. Let
[51:43] the Holy Spirit reveal the word, oh God.
[51:48] Do more than we can even anticipate or
[51:51] expect or ask for in Jesus Christ's
[51:55] name. We thank you now. Amen.
[51:59] Amen.
[52:01] I'll invite you to turn to your Bible to
[52:03] Exodus the 12th chapter.
[52:10] And I would ask for your undivided
[52:12] attention. Sometimes we approach
[52:15] subjects that we are you may hear things
[52:19] that you've heard before or reference uh
[52:22] reference to scriptures and statements
[52:24] we I have made before but uh there's a
[52:28] area of this subject that I uh just I am
[52:34] not able to completely explore but I
[52:38] feel that I should approach it anyhow
[52:41] and see just how God will deal with deal
[52:45] with our hearts. In Exodus 12, we start
[52:47] at verse one. And the Lord spake unto
[52:50] Moses and Aaron in the land of Egypt,
[52:52] saying, "This month shall be unto you
[52:54] the beginning of months. It shall be the
[52:57] first month of the year to you. Speak
[52:59] unto all the congregation of Israel,
[53:01] saying, In the 10th day of this month,
[53:03] they shall take to them every man a lamb
[53:06] according to the house of their fathers,
[53:08] a lamb for an house. And if the
[53:11] household be too little for the lamb,
[53:13] let him and his neighbor next unto his
[53:16] house take it according to the number of
[53:18] the souls, every man according to his
[53:21] eating shall uh make your count for the
[53:24] lamb. Your lamb shall be without
[53:27] blemish, a male of the first year. You
[53:31] shall take it out from the sheep or from
[53:33] the goats, and you shall keep it up
[53:36] until the 14th day of the same month.
[53:38] And the whole assembly of the
[53:39] congregation of Israel shall kill it in
[53:42] the evening. And they shall take the
[53:45] blood and strike it on the two side
[53:48] posts, and on the upper doorposts of the
[53:50] houses wherein they shall eat it. And
[53:53] I'm going to skip from seven down to 13.
[53:57] And the blood shall be to you for a
[53:59] token upon the houses where you are. And
[54:03] when I see the blood, I will pass over
[54:05] you, and the plague shall not be upon
[54:09] you to destroy you when I smite the land
[54:12] of Egypt.
[54:13] &gt;&gt; I'd like you then to turn also to Isaiah
[54:16] the 53rd chapter, and we'll begin
[54:18] reading at verse one.
[54:26] Isaiah 53.
[54:38] Who hath believed our report? And to
[54:40] whom is the arm of the Lord revealed?
[54:42] For he shall grow up before him as a
[54:44] tender plant, and as a root out of dry
[54:47] ground. He hath no form or comeliness.
[54:51] And when we shall see him, there is no
[54:53] beauty that we should be that we should
[54:55] desire him. He is despised and rejected
[54:59] of men, a man of sorrows, and acquainted
[55:02] with grief. And we hid as it wear our
[55:04] faces from him. He was despised, and we
[55:07] esteemed him not. Surely he hath borne
[55:11] our griefs, and carried our sorrows. Yet
[55:14] we did esteem him stricken, smitten of
[55:18] God, and afflicted. And he was wounded
[55:20] for our transgressions. He was bruised
[55:22] for our iniquities. And the chastisement
[55:25] of our peace was upon him. And with his
[55:28] stripes we are healed. All we like sheep
[55:31] have gone astray. We have turned
[55:33] everyone to his own way. And the Lord
[55:36] hath laid on him the iniquity of us all.
[55:39] He was oppressed and he was afflicted.
[55:42] Yet he opened not his mouth. He is
[55:44] brought as a lamb to the slaughter and
[55:46] as a sheep. before her shears is dumb.
[55:49] So he opened not his mouth. He was taken
[55:52] from prison and from judgment. And who
[55:55] shall declare his generation? For he was
[55:58] cut off out of the land of the living.
[56:02] For the transgression of my people was
[56:05] he stricken. And he made his grave with
[56:08] the wicked and with the rich in his
[56:09] death. Because he had done no violence.
[56:13] Neither was any deceit in his mouth. Yet
[56:16] it pleased the Lord to bruise him. He
[56:20] hath put him to grief when thou shalt
[56:23] make his soul an offering for sin. He
[56:26] shall see his seed. He shall prolong his
[56:29] days, and the pleasure of the Lord shall
[56:32] prosper in his hand. He shall see the
[56:35] travail of his soul, and shall be
[56:37] satisfied. By his knowledge shall my
[56:40] righteous servant justify many, for he
[56:42] shall bear their iniquities.
[56:45] Therefore will I divide him a portion
[56:48] with the great and he shall divide the
[56:50] spoil with the strong because he hath
[56:53] poured out his soul unto death. Remember
[56:56] now the soul is the nature of the life
[56:58] and that's what Adam lost. And he shall
[57:00] pour out his soul unto death and he was
[57:03] numbered with the transgressors and he
[57:06] bear the sin of many and made
[57:09] intercession for the transgressors.
[57:12] Amen. God bless you as you have your
[57:14] seats and keep your attention to these
[57:17] words which we have read.
[57:22] The Passover lamb
[57:25] in the first Exodus,
[57:28] the Passover lamb was to be without
[57:32] blemish.
[57:36] However, the most perfect lamb
[57:40] that they could find amongst their herds
[57:45] could never fulfill
[57:47] the required meaning of blemish. Brother
[57:51] Brandham refers to words. He says we
[57:53] could say the word bored. Well, a board
[57:56] could be this.
[57:58] You could leave the service this morning
[58:00] and say, "I was just bored."
[58:03] You could have a a
[58:06] uh some kind of a game board. Uh you
[58:09] could have board say, "Well, I have room
[58:11] and board. I'm living here and I have
[58:14] room and board." And it's one word
[58:17] bored. Although maybe spelled slight
[58:19] slightly different, it is sounds the
[58:21] same. And the one word in English has
[58:24] many many different meanings. The word
[58:26] blemish in to us uh that speak the
[58:30] English language or have learned the
[58:32] English language, we understand a
[58:34] blemish to be a mark or a flaw
[58:38] or a uh uh something that an
[58:43] imperfection or something that spoils
[58:45] the appearance of something. It has a a
[58:49] blemish on it. It could be a blemish on
[58:51] a person's body or a blemish on a piece
[58:54] of uh work that we're doing. And a
[58:57] blemish also can be to spoil a
[59:01] reputation. Someone has a a reputation
[59:04] and something has taken place and it's a
[59:06] blemish uh a mark on them. But the
[59:09] blemish in the Hebrew is very very
[59:13] different. And it is this blemish is
[59:18] complete. Something that is complete,
[59:22] something that is whole, something that
[59:25] is entire.
[59:27] Something that is healthful, something
[59:29] that is unimpaired,
[59:32] something that is innocent,
[59:35] something that has integrity.
[59:38] This isn't a blemish like a mark that is
[59:40] spoiled. This is a that it must be
[59:43] without blemish. Something that is uh
[59:47] entirely in accord
[59:50] and and with truth and fact. It can't be
[59:54] something that is is just you know
[59:57] similar or something. It has to be in
[59:59] truth and it is actually in fact this is
[1:00:03] you can speak about an animal and I've
[1:00:05] heard them speak of horses for example
[1:00:08] and the integrity of the animal which
[1:00:10] has something to do with its breeding
[1:00:12] and something to do with the its
[1:00:15] structure and the way that it it's is
[1:00:17] very complete. It's a it has integrity
[1:00:20] as a as an animal. And so uh this lamb
[1:00:25] of the Old Testament, it could never
[1:00:27] complete and fully uh be what the word
[1:00:32] blemish was. But they were to do their
[1:00:35] utmost go and find a lamb of the first
[1:00:38] year. And this lamb is to be without
[1:00:41] blemish.
[1:00:43] It also is uh something not only to
[1:00:46] complete but to be finished to be at an
[1:00:50] end to be completely crossed over. And I
[1:00:54] want to approach that from this
[1:00:56] direction.
[1:00:58] God completely
[1:01:00] crossed over in the lamb of God that we
[1:01:05] know as Jesus Christ.
[1:01:07] &gt;&gt; Amen. He completely crossed over the
[1:01:10] great chasm that was that could not be
[1:01:13] crossed. when Lazarus the beggar died
[1:01:17] and the rich man died and the rich man
[1:01:22] he was in torment and he wanted Lazarus
[1:01:25] to dip his finger in water and cool his
[1:01:28] tongue and uh and he cried out to father
[1:01:31] Abraham and and and and the one he was
[1:01:34] speaking to responded and said that
[1:01:36] there's a great chasm
[1:01:38] &gt;&gt; between fixed between you and I
[1:01:41] &gt;&gt; and no one from here can go there and no
[1:01:44] one from there could go here. Listen to
[1:01:46] me friends as we're sitting here today.
[1:01:48] There's people in both both places.
[1:01:52] &gt;&gt; There are people that are in torment.
[1:01:55] &gt;&gt; There are people that will be in a state
[1:01:58] of torment and and seeing a cross or
[1:02:01] some how but it's a chasm that is fixed.
[1:02:05] But God crossed over that chasm. Amen.
[1:02:09] &gt;&gt; God came from the realms and the portals
[1:02:12] of glory and bliss and holiness and
[1:02:16] purity and came down into this Satan's
[1:02:20] Eden.
[1:02:22] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:02:24] The Bible says to it that God was in
[1:02:27] Christ, reconciling the world unto
[1:02:30] himself, not imputing their
[1:02:33] transgressions,
[1:02:34] uh, trespasses rather, unto them, but
[1:02:38] and hath committed unto us the word of
[1:02:40] reconciliation.
[1:02:42] No man has ever been able to cross, but
[1:02:46] God crossed over. In other words, this
[1:02:48] is part of bringing this without
[1:02:52] blemish.
[1:02:54] That lamb that they slayed was not able
[1:02:58] to even touch or had no knowledge of a
[1:03:01] chasm. right?
[1:03:02] &gt;&gt; Could not complete the act of being a he
[1:03:06] was a Passover lamb only foreshadowing
[1:03:10] that there was something coming,
[1:03:12] &gt;&gt; something that could cross over,
[1:03:15] &gt;&gt; something that could reach a fallen man,
[1:03:19] &gt;&gt; something that could come back to
[1:03:22] humanity and reconcile him back to God.
[1:03:26] &gt;&gt; That lamb could not do it.
[1:03:30] Brother Brandham said in the voice of
[1:03:32] the sign he said you remember the rich
[1:03:34] man in Lazarus there's a great gulf betw
[1:03:36] twix you and he that no man has ever
[1:03:39] crossed or ever will cross
[1:03:43] in the message fellowship he said the
[1:03:45] super sign Jehovah as a boy playing
[1:03:50] Jehovah a man toiling
[1:03:53] uh in the carpenter shop Jehovah himself
[1:03:56] made flesh and dwelt among
[1:03:59] And I love this phrase, stretched his
[1:04:01] tent
[1:04:03] &gt;&gt; down here.
[1:04:04] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:04:05] &gt;&gt; Made himself a body to live in to have a
[1:04:08] blood cell. And that that blood cell
[1:04:11] could be broken. Hallelujah. That was
[1:04:14] the lamb of God that was slain from the
[1:04:16] foundation of the world to and brings us
[1:04:20] eternal redemption. The Bible said so
[1:04:23] here. It brought us eternal redemption
[1:04:26] and we are purchased by the precious
[1:04:28] blood of Jesus Christ which was given
[1:04:31] which has given us eternal life. And how
[1:04:33] did he do it? He said I don't know.
[1:04:36] &gt;&gt; We don't know how he did it but he did
[1:04:38] it.
[1:04:39] &gt;&gt; He crossed over part of blemish. He'll
[1:04:43] be without blemish.
[1:04:44] &gt;&gt; He must be able to achieve this.
[1:04:48] &gt;&gt; And be not afraid. He said he was the
[1:04:50] son of God but yet he was God. God
[1:04:54] changed his cast from a spirit and
[1:04:57] stretched his tent uh and began he
[1:05:01] become us. He become us that we through
[1:05:04] his grace might become him. And that's
[1:05:07] the phrase I believe that inspired
[1:05:09] brother Donnie Reagan uh
[1:05:12] to write that course. He became me that
[1:05:15] I could become him.
[1:05:17] &gt;&gt; Amen. And in the message identified
[1:05:20] uh identified Christ of all ages. He
[1:05:24] said look at Mary. He said I believe she
[1:05:26] was a virgin woman certainly but she was
[1:05:29] just an incubator that God used to bring
[1:05:32] Christ to the earth.
[1:05:34] &gt;&gt; I tell you these are such powerful so
[1:05:37] profound statements. You won't hear this
[1:05:39] in a Bible school.
[1:05:42] &gt;&gt; You won't hear this by some theology.
[1:05:45] And here we sit as humble people.
[1:05:48] He believing this word take it into your
[1:05:50] heart
[1:05:51] &gt;&gt; and even if you just say I believe that
[1:05:54] &gt;&gt; God will honor that
[1:05:57] &gt;&gt; and brought used to bring Christ to the
[1:06:00] earth the house that God stretched his
[1:06:03] tent from being Jehovah to man. He was
[1:06:07] Emmanuel God dwelling among us camping
[1:06:11] with us. God handled in the flesh. God
[1:06:15] housed in a tent called a man that was
[1:06:18] the son of God.
[1:06:20] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:06:23] &gt;&gt; Now listen as we just make our way.
[1:06:24] You're listening close and I'm I I
[1:06:26] appreciate that. And lo a voice Matthew
[1:06:30] records in Matthew 3:17. And low a voice
[1:06:34] from heaven saying
[1:06:37] this is my son my beloved. This is my
[1:06:40] beloved son in whom I'm well pleased.
[1:06:45] But he wasn't wounded yet.
[1:06:48] He wasn't bruised yet. He hadn't
[1:06:51] fulfilled any of Isaiah 53 yet.
[1:06:55] He just came up from baptism.
[1:06:58] &gt;&gt; He didn't have a flaw yet. He didn't
[1:07:01] have a mar yet. He didn't feel the
[1:07:04] suffering of your sin and mine.
[1:07:09] And God is saying,
[1:07:13] "This is my beloved son in whom I'm well
[1:07:16] pleased."
[1:07:18] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:07:19] &gt;&gt; Then in Matthew 16 and coming into
[1:07:22] Matthew 17, the last verses of Matthew
[1:07:25] 16, Jesus said, "There are some here
[1:07:28] that will not taste of death until they
[1:07:30] see the kingdom coming, the the glory of
[1:07:34] God and the kingdom coming."
[1:07:37] Maybe I'll just read that so I have it
[1:07:39] exactly right.
[1:07:49] Verily I say unto you, there be some
[1:07:51] standing here which shall not taste of
[1:07:53] death till they see the Son of Man
[1:07:56] coming in his kingdom.
[1:07:59] &gt;&gt; And after a few And after six days,
[1:08:02] Jesus taketh Peter, James, and John,
[1:08:04] those three
[1:08:08] up into a high mountain apart.
[1:08:11] And he was transfigured before them.
[1:08:14] And his face did shine as the sun, and
[1:08:17] his raignment was white as light.
[1:08:21] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:08:21] &gt;&gt; And behold, there appeared Moses and
[1:08:24] Elijah
[1:08:26] &gt;&gt; talking with him. And as we've said
[1:08:29] before, and it's not new to most of you,
[1:08:31] but there was you were represented on
[1:08:35] that mountain.
[1:08:37] &gt;&gt; If you have eternal life, I'll read a
[1:08:39] quote for you. Brother Brandham says,
[1:08:40] "You were there.
[1:08:44] &gt;&gt; If you have eternal life, which could
[1:08:46] only come from Christ, you were there on
[1:08:49] the mountain.
[1:08:51] &gt;&gt; You're not just represented there, but
[1:08:52] you were there on the mountain. very
[1:08:54] life that you have in you was there on
[1:08:57] the mountain.
[1:08:58] &gt;&gt; But this time Jesus is glorified.
[1:09:01] &gt;&gt; Yes. Amen.
[1:09:03] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:09:04] &gt;&gt; Still has no marks.
[1:09:05] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:09:06] &gt;&gt; No. He wasn't there bruised. He wasn't
[1:09:09] there with a visage that was marred more
[1:09:11] than that of any man. He wasn't there
[1:09:13] with nail scars in his hand. He wasn't
[1:09:15] there with a spear in his side.
[1:09:19] And once again the voice cried out and
[1:09:23] said this is my beloved son
[1:09:26] &gt;&gt; in whom I'm well pleased. So now we have
[1:09:31] we have the voice saying this is my
[1:09:33] beloved son before the marring.
[1:09:35] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:09:36] &gt;&gt; Before the flaw.
[1:09:38] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:09:39] &gt;&gt; And the same thing being said after.
[1:09:41] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:09:43] &gt;&gt; It all happened.
[1:09:49] once before and once after because the
[1:09:52] after he's glorified.
[1:09:54] &gt;&gt; Now this is very significant in the
[1:09:57] Easter seal.
[1:09:59] He said, "Now look at the
[1:10:00] transfiguration. We're all represented
[1:10:02] there in transfiguration. Look what we
[1:10:05] are seeing." Notice just what we are
[1:10:07] seeing today.
[1:10:09] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:10:09] &gt;&gt; Quickening power of God.
[1:10:12] &gt;&gt; We was all there. Right.
[1:10:16] &gt;&gt; Because we're seeing the quickening
[1:10:17] power of God now. We were all there.
[1:10:23] &gt;&gt; He said there was the dead saints
[1:10:25] represented in Moses.
[1:10:28] &gt;&gt; There was the resurrection and Jesus
[1:10:30] Christ glorified
[1:10:32] &gt;&gt; Elijah. Elijah. Moses. Elijah. Moses.
[1:10:36] Elijah and Jesus. All standing on the
[1:10:38] mountain. The dead saints. The rapture
[1:10:40] saints. And Jesus glorified.
[1:10:42] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:10:43] And there was Peter, James, and John
[1:10:46] representing those that were living.
[1:10:50] And hear his voice. He said, "When Peter
[1:10:52] and John and James saw Moses and Elijah,
[1:10:55] they recognized them on Mount
[1:10:57] Transfiguration.
[1:10:59] &gt;&gt; But it's a body. But when but then when
[1:11:02] that body a kind of a celestial body
[1:11:05] when it returns back to the earth it
[1:11:07] picks up the substance that it once
[1:11:10] lived in and then becomes a glorified
[1:11:13] body. And that body is the one that
[1:11:15] we'll see the Lord Jesus in in his
[1:11:18] resurrected body.
[1:11:20] &gt;&gt; Whoa.
[1:11:22] What powerful things
[1:11:26] &gt;&gt; I'm speaking it that we might believe it
[1:11:29] &gt;&gt; and we may not understand it but we say
[1:11:32] those are God's words
[1:11:34] &gt;&gt; vindicated and confirmed
[1:11:37] &gt;&gt; and I am I believe that
[1:11:40] &gt;&gt; and I shall participate in that
[1:11:43] &gt;&gt; and we are participating this morning
[1:11:46] &gt;&gt; in the message the resurrection of
[1:11:48] Jesus. He said, "Look at his eyes. No
[1:11:51] more filled with tears." He said, "They
[1:11:53] couldn't even uh they could even pierce
[1:11:56] like the sun in the middle of the day.
[1:11:59] No more nail scars in his feet. They
[1:12:02] were like brass." He's speaking about
[1:12:04] Revelation chapter 1. They were like
[1:12:07] brass tried in the fire. He was free
[1:12:09] from all of that. He was glorified and
[1:12:12] his hands wasn't scarred more. And he
[1:12:15] was in the midst of his churches a
[1:12:18] blessing.
[1:12:19] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:12:20] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:12:20] &gt;&gt; He had indeed crossed over. He had come
[1:12:23] the whole distance.
[1:12:26] &gt;&gt; He'd come from the whole distance from
[1:12:28] his holiness. Can you even imagine just
[1:12:31] for a moment uh the the place of God
[1:12:35] where even saraphims just cry holy,
[1:12:38] holy, holy, holy
[1:12:40] &gt;&gt; and can scarcely approach to such a a
[1:12:43] being as that. And yet that God
[1:12:46] &gt;&gt; said, "I will cross over."
[1:12:49] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:12:50] &gt;&gt; Without blemish. I'll cross over.
[1:12:53] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. I'll come to a sinful world
[1:12:56] and be sinless.
[1:12:59] &gt;&gt; I will come and be born of a woman.
[1:13:03] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:13:04] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:13:05] &gt;&gt; The very God, I will stretch my tent
[1:13:09] &gt;&gt; further than no one can comprehend this.
[1:13:12] I'll stretch my tent.
[1:13:14] &gt;&gt; I'll let the life out of my being.
[1:13:17] &gt;&gt; I'll come down. I'll stretch my tent.
[1:13:20] I'll cross over.
[1:13:21] &gt;&gt; And because the blood cell in the first
[1:13:24] mother Eve because it was contaminated,
[1:13:28] &gt;&gt; hallelujah.
[1:13:30] &gt;&gt; Because it was contaminated and invaded,
[1:13:33] &gt;&gt; God came down.
[1:13:36] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:13:38] &gt;&gt; To finish and to complete it and to make
[1:13:40] it finish. Amen.
[1:13:42] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:13:43] &gt;&gt; To destroy
[1:13:45] and to make to make it sound.
[1:13:48] The Bible tells us in John 19:30, "And
[1:13:51] when Jesus therefore had received the
[1:13:53] vinegar, he said, "It is finished."
[1:13:57] &gt;&gt; That's what blemish is without blemish.
[1:14:01] Blemish is to finish.
[1:14:03] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:14:04] &gt;&gt; Has to be something that's finished. A
[1:14:05] lamb that's so complete has such
[1:14:09] integrity of being that it can finish
[1:14:12] the task that it was sent to do. The
[1:14:15] lamb that was laid there in its throat
[1:14:16] cut open couldn't finish it. It still
[1:14:19] left the man condemned.
[1:14:22] &gt;&gt; But this one crossed over.
[1:14:26] &gt;&gt; Came down to you.
[1:14:28] &gt;&gt; You're sitting here today, but this lamb
[1:14:30] I'm speaking of came to you. came to you
[1:14:34] in your sin, came to you in your
[1:14:36] darkness, came to you in your bondage,
[1:14:39] came to you in your sickness. He may be
[1:14:42] coming to you today because you're
[1:14:44] bound. You're you have fears, you have
[1:14:47] suspicions, you have bitterness, you
[1:14:49] have whatever more. He's here to come to
[1:14:52] you.
[1:14:53] &gt;&gt; I'm here to say he crossed over
[1:14:57] &gt;&gt; and said it is finished.
[1:15:00] &gt;&gt; I've completed this. I'm the lamb
[1:15:02] without blemish.
[1:15:04] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:15:06] &gt;&gt; I'm the lamb that can complete the job.
[1:15:09] &gt;&gt; I'm the lamb that can raise your body
[1:15:12] &gt;&gt; out of the grave.
[1:15:15] &gt;&gt; I'm the lamb that can give you healing
[1:15:17] today.
[1:15:18] &gt;&gt; If you can believe, all things are
[1:15:21] possible to them that believe.
[1:15:23] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:15:25] &gt;&gt; I felt so inspired. I felt that God
[1:15:28] wanted me to come here and call on this
[1:15:30] congregation and those that are
[1:15:32] streaming and all that will ever hear my
[1:15:34] voice. Whatever you do, believe on him.
[1:15:37] &gt;&gt; Believe his word.
[1:15:39] &gt;&gt; He is the lamb that came. There is
[1:15:42] nothing insufficient with him. He's
[1:15:44] complete.
[1:15:46] &gt;&gt; He finished the task.
[1:15:48] &gt;&gt; He finished it for you.
[1:15:50] &gt;&gt; He didn't need it.
[1:15:52] &gt;&gt; You needed it.
[1:15:53] &gt;&gt; And he came to you. You couldn't go to
[1:15:56] him. You couldn't cross over. You
[1:15:59] couldn't spam the chasm. He came to you.
[1:16:04] &gt;&gt; He is here coming to you this morning.
[1:16:08] &gt;&gt; You can believe it.
[1:16:10] &gt;&gt; There's not a devil in hell. There's not
[1:16:13] a demon of darkness. There isn't death
[1:16:16] itself. Greater is he that is in you as
[1:16:19] a believer.
[1:16:22] It's here. I don't care what kind of
[1:16:25] spirit
[1:16:26] &gt;&gt; has been on your trail
[1:16:29] &gt;&gt; and hounding you.
[1:16:30] &gt;&gt; You have you have perfect right to be
[1:16:33] free of him
[1:16:34] &gt;&gt; today. Let this not be another Sunday
[1:16:37] morning. Let this be the day. We don't
[1:16:41] care about a Sunday morning or what day
[1:16:43] it is. This is a day that the Lord hath
[1:16:46] made and we shall rejoice and be glad in
[1:16:49] it.
[1:16:51] Yes.
[1:16:53] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:16:57] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:16:57] &gt;&gt; He said, "It is finished."
[1:17:00] &gt;&gt; This was the lamb.
[1:17:01] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:17:02] &gt;&gt; That was without blemish.
[1:17:05] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:17:06] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. He crossed over
[1:17:09] from the portals of glory. He made
[1:17:11] himself of no reputation.
[1:17:13] Paul said in the Philippians, "And took
[1:17:16] upon him the form of a servant and was
[1:17:19] made in the likeness of men."
[1:17:22] Apostle Paul said in Romans 8:3, "For
[1:17:25] what the law could not do in that it was
[1:17:28] weak through the flesh,
[1:17:30] &gt;&gt; God sending his own son
[1:17:33] &gt;&gt; in the likeness of sinful flesh and for
[1:17:36] sin condemns sin in the flesh."
[1:17:41] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. I tell you, sin is
[1:17:42] condemned.
[1:17:44] &gt;&gt; Sin's under the sentence of death
[1:17:47] &gt;&gt; and annihilation.
[1:17:49] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:17:50] &gt;&gt; Isn't it wonderful to know that we'll
[1:17:52] have a we're going to live in a place
[1:17:54] without sin.
[1:17:56] &gt;&gt; Without temptation,
[1:17:58] &gt;&gt; without an evil thing,
[1:18:00] &gt;&gt; no wonder he said, "What a Mother's
[1:18:02] Day."
[1:18:04] &gt;&gt; It's going to be a time we're going to
[1:18:05] be gathered together. Hallelujah.
[1:18:08] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:18:10] &gt;&gt; And just one more time. Lord Phoenix,
[1:18:14] &gt;&gt; he said while I'm reading or speaking,
[1:18:16] he said while I'm reading or speaking,
[1:18:18] just remember
[1:18:20] the omnipresent God is always here
[1:18:22] present.
[1:18:24] &gt;&gt; And as a brother said about the
[1:18:26] epileptic
[1:18:27] of the last time we were here, God can
[1:18:31] heal cancer, parallelism,
[1:18:33] &gt;&gt; whatever it is, he has already done it.
[1:18:35] Amen.
[1:18:36] &gt;&gt; If he can just get you to believe that,
[1:18:41] &gt;&gt; there's nothing that's impossible today
[1:18:44] if he can just get us to believe that.
[1:18:48] &gt;&gt; He said, "You're not saved tonight.
[1:18:50] You've been saved.
[1:18:52] &gt;&gt; You were saved, 1900 years ago.
[1:18:55] &gt;&gt; And now he said, maybe tonight you'll
[1:18:57] accept that salvation,
[1:18:59] &gt;&gt; but it's already paid for. The debt has
[1:19:02] been cleared up. the devil that put you
[1:19:05] in the pawn shop. And that devil that
[1:19:07] put you in the pawn shop, Jesus came and
[1:19:10] redeemed you and opened up the doors.
[1:19:13] And the only thing you have to do is
[1:19:15] walk out
[1:19:17] &gt;&gt; and claim your liberty.
[1:19:20] &gt;&gt; That's all. You have a receipt from God
[1:19:25] &gt;&gt; that the debt is paid.
[1:19:28] Don't ever let anybody try to bring the
[1:19:30] the the consequence of that debt back on
[1:19:33] you. The debt has been paid.
[1:19:36] &gt;&gt; I'm going to glorify the cross.
[1:19:38] &gt;&gt; I'm going to glorify our lamb.
[1:19:44] &gt;&gt; And Jesus said in his last words, "It is
[1:19:47] finished."
[1:19:48] &gt;&gt; The prophet reconfirming it again, "It
[1:19:51] is finished."
[1:19:52] Every redemptive blessing was completely
[1:19:55] finished.
[1:19:56] &gt;&gt; When he said it is finished, that line
[1:19:58] in Exodus couldn't say it.
[1:20:01] &gt;&gt; But this one crossed over
[1:20:03] &gt;&gt; and he said it.
[1:20:06] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:20:07] &gt;&gt; Don't walk out with the same things
[1:20:09] hanging on you.
[1:20:10] &gt;&gt; Don't walk out even with the same
[1:20:12] physical phys physical sicknesses or
[1:20:14] diseases. Let's leave them here.
[1:20:18] &gt;&gt; Let's take a hold of the receipt.
[1:20:22] And I don't care what the thing is.
[1:20:26] &gt;&gt; I don't care what it is.
[1:20:28] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:20:30] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. To
[1:20:32] [Applause]
[1:20:36] &gt;&gt; the devil's a liar.
[1:20:40] &gt;&gt; He's trying to impose sicknesses and
[1:20:42] diseases
[1:20:43] &gt;&gt; and sins and fears and complexes and all
[1:20:46] kinds of things on God's people. We're
[1:20:49] not of this world.
[1:20:52] Amen.
[1:20:53] &gt;&gt; That's of this world, but we're not of
[1:20:55] this world.
[1:20:57] &gt;&gt; We're in the world, but not of the
[1:20:59] world.
[1:21:01] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:21:03] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:21:04] &gt;&gt; Now, I want to come to something that
[1:21:06] been difficult and I hope and I'm I've
[1:21:08] been have some trepidation within myself
[1:21:11] here just wondering if I can somehow
[1:21:15] make it as clear as it's it's stirring
[1:21:18] in my own heart.
[1:21:20] this lamb
[1:21:22] that crossed over
[1:21:25] and we read of it.
[1:21:28] It was our griefs,
[1:21:31] our sorrows,
[1:21:34] &gt;&gt; our infirmities,
[1:21:36] our the chastisement of our peace was
[1:21:39] upon him and with his stripes we are
[1:21:42] healed. He's despised.
[1:21:44] &gt;&gt; He's rejected.
[1:21:46] &gt;&gt; Amen. It was that was all ours
[1:21:50] &gt;&gt; that was laid on him
[1:21:53] &gt;&gt; and he took it our sickness in a grief
[1:21:56] and sorrows and trouble and wars and
[1:21:58] starvation and mental illness and the
[1:22:02] prophet said that in Eden when Eve fell
[1:22:06] and Adam then followed followed her all
[1:22:09] everything that we see every mental
[1:22:12] institution every every prison
[1:22:15] &gt;&gt; every every hospital bed.
[1:22:18] &gt;&gt; Go into the go into these senior
[1:22:20] citizens homes and see these poor people
[1:22:23] and and and see all of the uh uh mental
[1:22:29] conditions. And it is truly sad because
[1:22:32] it's all part of death.
[1:22:34] &gt;&gt; No wonder we're going to be restored to
[1:22:37] our youth
[1:22:38] &gt;&gt; once again.
[1:22:40] &gt;&gt; That is not a pipe dream.
[1:22:42] &gt;&gt; That's not a pie in the sky. That's a
[1:22:45] promise of God.
[1:22:47] &gt;&gt; And if that is not so, we are wasting
[1:22:49] our time.
[1:22:50] &gt;&gt; We should go out, eat, drink, and be
[1:22:52] merry, for tomorrow we die. But I say
[1:22:56] we, tomorrow we live.
[1:22:58] &gt;&gt; Receive the Lord Jesus Christ and thou
[1:23:01] shalt be saved.
[1:23:05] &gt;&gt; How soon, as early as you can understand
[1:23:08] that you children and young people,
[1:23:11] &gt;&gt; you want to be saved, you want to go to
[1:23:12] heaven. This might be meat and potatoes,
[1:23:15] but this is the truth.
[1:23:17] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:23:21] &gt;&gt; Sicknesses and grief and sorrows.
[1:23:23] Galatians says, Paul speaks in
[1:23:26] Galatians, idolatry and witchcraft and
[1:23:28] hatred and variance and emulations and
[1:23:31] wrath and strath and strife and
[1:23:34] seditions
[1:23:35] and heresies, envyings and murders and
[1:23:39] drunkenness. We have so much of it that
[1:23:41] we become immune almost. We become numb
[1:23:44] to the whole thing. We hear it all the
[1:23:47] time and we can't even imagine a place
[1:23:49] without that. Heaven will have none of
[1:23:52] this.
[1:23:53] &gt;&gt; The kingdom that has been born in our
[1:23:55] hearts will have none of this.
[1:23:58] and drunkenness and rellings and the
[1:24:00] such like of which I tell you before
[1:24:03] tell you before as I have also told you
[1:24:06] in time past that they which do such
[1:24:08] things shall not inherit the kingdom of
[1:24:11] God.
[1:24:12] &gt;&gt; And he said in Romans for we know that
[1:24:15] the whole creation groanth and travaleth
[1:24:18] in pain together until now. And he said
[1:24:22] in Corinthians 1 Corinthians 6:11, "And
[1:24:25] such were some of you,
[1:24:28] &gt;&gt; but you are washed,
[1:24:32] &gt;&gt; but you are sanctified,
[1:24:35] &gt;&gt; but you are justified
[1:24:37] &gt;&gt; in the name of the Lord Jesus
[1:24:39] &gt;&gt; and by the spirit of our God."
[1:24:42] &gt;&gt; And such were some of you. I will say
[1:24:44] such were all of us.
[1:24:46] &gt;&gt; But you were washed.
[1:24:50] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:24:51] Hallelujah. But you are sanctified.
[1:24:55] &gt;&gt; You're cleansed.
[1:24:57] &gt;&gt; Isn't this something worth rejoicing
[1:24:59] over?
[1:25:01] &gt;&gt; This isn't an NBA game. This isn't a
[1:25:03] hockey game. This is the game of life.
[1:25:07] &gt;&gt; And such were some of you.
[1:25:09] &gt;&gt; But you were washed.
[1:25:12] &gt;&gt; You are sanctified.
[1:25:15] &gt;&gt; You're cleansed
[1:25:16] &gt;&gt; by the blood of Jesus Christ.
[1:25:19] This lamb who crossed over
[1:25:22] &gt;&gt; and pitched his tent with us
[1:25:25] &gt;&gt; and felt everything that we failed and
[1:25:27] he was tempted in all points like you
[1:25:29] are.
[1:25:32] &gt;&gt; Don't have a pity story now. Don't have
[1:25:34] a pity party. He was tempted in all
[1:25:37] points
[1:25:38] &gt;&gt; like you are.
[1:25:39] &gt;&gt; Like I am. We all have a devil to fight
[1:25:43] and we all have a victory to win. And
[1:25:46] I'm preaching today that you might have
[1:25:48] victory in this service and go out and
[1:25:50] the rest of your life enjoy that. Enjoy
[1:25:53] that victory.
[1:25:56] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:25:57] &gt;&gt; If it's truth,
[1:25:59] &gt;&gt; God will vindicate it.
[1:26:01] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:26:02] &gt;&gt; And this is truth.
[1:26:04] &gt;&gt; I'm reading the prophet's words.
[1:26:06] &gt;&gt; It's truth.
[1:26:07] &gt;&gt; If it's a lie, it won't work.
[1:26:10] &gt;&gt; But I can tell you that it works.
[1:26:13] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. Yes sir.
[1:26:19] &gt;&gt; As individuals,
[1:26:21] &gt;&gt; we are often responsible
[1:26:24] for our own wounding and our own scars.
[1:26:28] &gt;&gt; Other times scars are brought upon us.
[1:26:33] Brought upon us by circumstances that
[1:26:36] are beyond our control.
[1:26:39] Right?
[1:26:41] &gt;&gt; And we do anything we could to get out
[1:26:43] of it.
[1:26:47] &gt;&gt; If we had to sit here and live with our
[1:26:49] past,
[1:26:50] no one survives.
[1:26:55] &gt;&gt; And such were some of you.
[1:26:58] &gt;&gt; But you are washed.
[1:27:01] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:27:02] &gt;&gt; Such were some of you. You failed in the
[1:27:05] past, but you are washed. Amen.
[1:27:08] &gt;&gt; Glory to God.
[1:27:10] &gt;&gt; Glory to God.
[1:27:12] &gt;&gt; I tell you what, friends. I'm going to
[1:27:14] preach it.
[1:27:16] &gt;&gt; But such were some of you.
[1:27:19] &gt;&gt; But you are washed.
[1:27:21] &gt;&gt; You failed. Yes, we all failed, but you
[1:27:23] are washed.
[1:27:25] &gt;&gt; You have sinned. We all sinned, but you
[1:27:27] are washed.
[1:27:29] &gt;&gt; You might be a good sinner or a
[1:27:31] sophisticated sinner or a rotten sinner,
[1:27:33] but we're all sinners.
[1:27:35] &gt;&gt; But you are washed. when you are
[1:27:37] sanctified.
[1:27:38] [Applause]
[1:27:42] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:27:43] [Music]
[1:27:48] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:27:55] Someone might be inclined to say,
[1:27:59] "Well, uh, I didn't experience those
[1:28:02] things." And I'm,
[1:28:05] "What does that do?
[1:28:07] I didn't experience those things. I was
[1:28:10] brought up in a good home, brought up in
[1:28:11] a Christian home, taught by the
[1:28:14] covenants of the word of God.
[1:28:17] I've lived clean and so on so forth."
[1:28:19] What does that do for you? I can tell
[1:28:22] you what. And you listen to me real
[1:28:24] close. That won't even open the G doors
[1:28:27] of heaven. Yeah.
[1:28:28] &gt;&gt; A fraction of an inch.
[1:28:30] &gt;&gt; So, well then what does it do for me? It
[1:28:32] makes your life down here better.
[1:28:34] &gt;&gt; You might have an easier life down here.
[1:28:37] If you don't have to have those things
[1:28:38] plague your mind, it has nothing to do
[1:28:40] with eternal life.
[1:28:44] &gt;&gt; By the law, no one is saved.
[1:28:46] &gt;&gt; By the law, no one is justified. By the
[1:28:49] works of the flesh, no one is justified.
[1:28:52] &gt;&gt; In fact, this brother Brandham says it
[1:28:54] very clear.
[1:28:56] He says, now reading out of Hebrews, now
[1:28:59] go on unto perfection.
[1:29:01] &gt;&gt; Jesus said, be therefore perfect as your
[1:29:03] father in heaven is perfect. And
[1:29:06] everyone, he says, and we're everyone.
[1:29:09] We are, he's including himself. We,
[1:29:12] William Brham, and you.
[1:29:13] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:29:14] &gt;&gt; We're everyone condemned.
[1:29:17] &gt;&gt; True. No matter what we ever do, we're
[1:29:20] condemned.
[1:29:22] &gt;&gt; We were born condemned.
[1:29:24] &gt;&gt; You remember when you were born? No, you
[1:29:26] don't remember when you were born. But
[1:29:27] the prophet said, "You were born
[1:29:29] condemned.
[1:29:32] &gt;&gt; We were born condemned." Your mama and
[1:29:35] papa was condemned.
[1:29:37] &gt;&gt; All condemned.
[1:29:39] &gt;&gt; All your ancestors were condemned.
[1:29:42] &gt;&gt; And was born in sin.
[1:29:44] &gt;&gt; All your ancestors born in sin. How are
[1:29:46] you going to rate anything?
[1:29:49] &gt;&gt; We're all sinners
[1:29:51] &gt;&gt; and shaped in iniquity. So, how are you
[1:29:53] ever going to get it?
[1:29:54] &gt;&gt; How are you going to be perfect?
[1:29:57] &gt;&gt; If you never done a thing, never stole,
[1:29:59] never lied, never done anything in your
[1:30:01] life, you're still condemned.
[1:30:04] &gt;&gt; You never been a bad person. You're
[1:30:06] condemned.
[1:30:08] &gt;&gt; How you going to get it? How you going
[1:30:10] to be perfect? Someone from perfection
[1:30:12] had to cross over.
[1:30:16] and pitch his tent next door to you.
[1:30:20] [Music]
[1:30:22] [Applause]
[1:30:23] &gt;&gt; You were condemned before you breathed
[1:30:25] your first breath.
[1:30:29] &gt;&gt; Now, somebody stand up and say, "I'm
[1:30:31] okay."
[1:30:33] &gt;&gt; Now, someone in the face of these words
[1:30:35] say, "Well, I'm, you know, I'm a little
[1:30:37] more sanctimonious." You're condemned.
[1:30:39] Before you breathed your first breath,
[1:30:41] you're condemned. your mama, your papa,
[1:30:44] your ancestors. We're all born in sin
[1:30:47] shape iniquities. We come here as
[1:30:49] sinners
[1:30:51] &gt;&gt; and there's no degree of sinners. We're
[1:30:54] all sinners,
[1:30:55] &gt;&gt; but you are washed.
[1:30:58] &gt;&gt; That was some of you, but you were
[1:31:00] washed.
[1:31:04] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:31:06] &gt;&gt; He said you were judged of God before
[1:31:08] you breathed your first breath. You were
[1:31:10] judged by the sexual desire of your
[1:31:13] father and mother who through their act
[1:31:15] brought you here on the earth and God
[1:31:17] condemned it in the beginning.
[1:31:21] &gt;&gt; How can we how can we come here sinless
[1:31:24] when we're the very act that brought us
[1:31:26] here
[1:31:27] &gt;&gt; was not God's perfect plan
[1:31:34] &gt;&gt; and you're condemned to start with. He
[1:31:36] said so every other person on the earth
[1:31:38] was condemned with you. Now, where are
[1:31:40] you going to get perfection?
[1:31:44] &gt;&gt; I kind of stepped ahead of myself to
[1:31:46] bring that in.
[1:31:52] &gt;&gt; Now,
[1:31:55] when we see, let me turn your focus and
[1:31:58] attention
[1:32:00] onto Christ, the perfect,
[1:32:04] spotless,
[1:32:06] &gt;&gt; sinless,
[1:32:08] &gt;&gt; son of God.
[1:32:10] And we could say as the prophet said, I
[1:32:13] was there.
[1:32:15] &gt;&gt; I died with him.
[1:32:17] &gt;&gt; But when you see his m and he talks
[1:32:20] about the masterpiece and here's the
[1:32:22] phrase in the masterpiece I have two
[1:32:24] different places. His brother Brandham
[1:32:27] says to me the masterpiece
[1:32:31] what made it the masterpiece was the
[1:32:34] stroke
[1:32:35] &gt;&gt; the mar
[1:32:37] &gt;&gt; that caused the flaw. that made it the
[1:32:39] masterpiece taking it from the from the
[1:32:43] uh uh Michelangelo's
[1:32:45] statue of of Moses and and he said when
[1:32:49] he saw in front of him what had been in
[1:32:52] his mind all of these times and he
[1:32:55] toiled all of these years and finally it
[1:32:58] was so perfect the image of his mind now
[1:33:01] put it in the spiritual what God had in
[1:33:03] his mind God had in his mind I'll cross
[1:33:07] over. I I will not lose my family. I
[1:33:13] will not lose my children. I will cross
[1:33:17] over this chasm and I'll pitch my tent
[1:33:20] with them.
[1:33:23] [Applause]
[1:33:24] &gt;&gt; I'll go the whole distance.
[1:33:27] &gt;&gt; That lamb couldn't do it. Abraham
[1:33:30] sacrificed and he brought he he brought
[1:33:33] Isaac to the mountain and raised his
[1:33:37] hand with a knife to bring it down which
[1:33:39] was a type of Christ.
[1:33:41] &gt;&gt; But that boy couldn't be bruised cuz he
[1:33:44] was born in sin.
[1:33:47] &gt;&gt; He couldn't be a sacrifice.
[1:33:51] &gt;&gt; No lambs could be a sacrifice.
[1:33:54] &gt;&gt; Even Isaac couldn't be a sacrifice.
[1:33:56] Yeah.
[1:33:57] &gt;&gt; And all through the scripture they
[1:34:00] sacrificed,
[1:34:01] &gt;&gt; but there was no redemption.
[1:34:03] &gt;&gt; But now we see one.
[1:34:05] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:34:05] &gt;&gt; And here he is.
[1:34:07] &gt;&gt; Here is the son of God.
[1:34:09] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:34:09] &gt;&gt; He's crossed over the whole distance.
[1:34:12] &gt;&gt; And so we say by faith, I'm identified
[1:34:15] in him.
[1:34:17] &gt;&gt; And there's a twofold thing here I want
[1:34:19] to get across. And I can say I'm also
[1:34:22] identified in the mar.
[1:34:24] &gt;&gt; Yes. Amen.
[1:34:27] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:34:28] &gt;&gt; Glory.
[1:34:29] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:34:30] &gt;&gt; I'm identified in the wound.
[1:34:32] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:34:34] &gt;&gt; That was there because I'm here.
[1:34:38] &gt;&gt; That wound was there when God smoked him
[1:34:41] and he was smitten of God.
[1:34:44] &gt;&gt; God smoked him. Yes. In this case, God
[1:34:46] allowed man to do it.
[1:34:49] &gt;&gt; God allowed man to do it. As I said, he
[1:34:51] allowed even Satan in the beginning. He
[1:34:54] allowed he allowed it to happen in Eden.
[1:34:57] Now he allowed the Roman soldiers and he
[1:35:00] allowed the the Jewish leadership and
[1:35:03] the scripture tells us and and even
[1:35:06] today in the world that you live in.
[1:35:08] This has been the ongoing argument for
[1:35:10] all of these centuries. The Vatican and
[1:35:13] Rome says the Jews killed him and the
[1:35:16] Jews said you killed him.
[1:35:19] &gt;&gt; It wasn't neither of them. God took his
[1:35:22] life.
[1:35:23] Jesus said, "No man, no man, no man, do
[1:35:28] you hear me? No man takes my life from
[1:35:30] me. I lay it down
[1:35:33] &gt;&gt; and I will take it up again."
[1:35:38] &gt;&gt; That, my friend, is crossing over.
[1:35:42] &gt;&gt; That's going the whole distance.
[1:35:45] &gt;&gt; And there isn't a man, woman, or a child
[1:35:47] in the sound of my voice. But what
[1:35:50] needed that to happen? And if he came
[1:35:53] over for the best person, he came over
[1:35:54] for the worst person. He came over for
[1:35:57] the prostitutes and the harlots. He came
[1:35:59] over for the drug addict, drug addicts,
[1:36:02] and all of the He came over for the weak
[1:36:04] and the strong. He came over for the
[1:36:06] good and those that live religious. He
[1:36:08] came over for you and he came over for
[1:36:11] everyone.
[1:36:14] &gt;&gt; And we're all in the same basket.
[1:36:18] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:36:20] Amen.
[1:36:22] &gt;&gt; In fact is
[1:36:27] it's not going to be the drunkard that's
[1:36:29] going to be surprised
[1:36:32] &gt;&gt; cuz he knows where he's going.
[1:36:33] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:36:34] &gt;&gt; It's going to be those that think I'm
[1:36:36] going to heaven.
[1:36:37] &gt;&gt; I'm going to heaven because I did this,
[1:36:38] because I did that,
[1:36:40] &gt;&gt; because I did all these different works.
[1:36:42] &gt;&gt; They're the ones going to be
[1:36:43] disappointed.
[1:36:45] &gt;&gt; That's true. Brother Brandham says
[1:36:48] those, he doesn't say those that are in
[1:36:50] the bars are going to be shocked when
[1:36:51] they find out the rapture happened.
[1:36:54] &gt;&gt; No, it's going to be those that come to
[1:36:55] church.
[1:36:56] [Music]
[1:36:59] &gt;&gt; Don't you, I say this with all the fear
[1:37:01] in my heart. Don't you dare
[1:37:05] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:37:06] &gt;&gt; come back to this church after the
[1:37:08] rapture happened. You make sure that
[1:37:11] you've gone also.
[1:37:13] &gt;&gt; You make sure you've changed. Why?
[1:37:16] Because he paid the price.
[1:37:20] &gt;&gt; Why would you miss such a gift? Why
[1:37:22] would you miss eternal bless? Why would
[1:37:25] you miss the rapture when it's been paid
[1:37:28] and we have the receive? It's already
[1:37:30] paid.
[1:37:33] &gt;&gt; Why risk it?
[1:37:35] [Music]
[1:37:39] &gt;&gt; Don't ever do that. Don't risk it. Don't
[1:37:41] lose it. Don't hang on to some little
[1:37:45] &gt;&gt; thing that seems so precious and a
[1:37:47] treasure to you and it's worthless.
[1:37:49] &gt;&gt; It's a piece of glass. It's not a
[1:37:50] diamond. It's a piece of glass.
[1:37:53] &gt;&gt; Don't hang on to some false hope.
[1:37:56] &gt;&gt; Just cast yourself completely. You know
[1:37:58] this is the truth. Amen.
[1:38:01] [Music]
[1:38:03] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:38:06] &gt;&gt; The masterpiece family
[1:38:09] was marred in Eden.
[1:38:12] And the prophet said that Satan came and
[1:38:14] crawled under the walls. They were
[1:38:16] protected by the word. And I must I
[1:38:19] don't want to take too much time. I'm
[1:38:22] seeking to watch it closely as we have
[1:38:26] the service tonight.
[1:38:29] But the dreadful effects, it was the
[1:38:31] dreadful effects of sin
[1:38:36] that brought the bruising and the
[1:38:38] wounding and the and the mar.
[1:38:44] &gt;&gt; So I I now this is what I want you to
[1:38:46] see. I'm coming right to the heart of it
[1:38:48] now.
[1:38:53] You say I'm identified in Christ
[1:38:56] and I'm I'm identified in the bruising.
[1:39:00] I'm identified in the mar.
[1:39:03] And this has always perplexed me. I've
[1:39:06] spoke on it a number of times, but I
[1:39:08] never came to this point yet.
[1:39:13] But brother Brandham said that the mar
[1:39:16] is what made it the masterpiece.
[1:39:20] I had to translate that and bring that
[1:39:22] on down because the mar
[1:39:25] represents
[1:39:27] I won't talk about you. I'll talk about
[1:39:29] me
[1:39:30] but you can take you can join me. It
[1:39:33] talks about our iniquity
[1:39:37] &gt;&gt; my failures
[1:39:40] &gt;&gt; our sin.
[1:39:42] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:39:45] our unbelief.
[1:39:46] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:39:49] &gt;&gt; Our criticism,
[1:39:52] &gt;&gt; everything that you can think,
[1:39:55] all the wars and all the starvation and
[1:39:58] all the things that happened, it just
[1:40:00] it's so magnified today. And I have to
[1:40:03] bring it down. But this is this was when
[1:40:06] I see the mar say that was my
[1:40:10] &gt;&gt; iniquities and my failures
[1:40:16] &gt;&gt; past and present and any that may be in
[1:40:19] the future.
[1:40:20] &gt;&gt; That's true.
[1:40:22] &gt;&gt; He was marred for me. Amen.
[1:40:25] &gt;&gt; And now a prophet comes and and and
[1:40:27] simply staggers
[1:40:30] our mental faculties by saying that
[1:40:36] stroke
[1:40:38] made it the masterpiece.
[1:40:40] &gt;&gt; Amen. And so I had to reduce it down and
[1:40:43] say how
[1:40:44] was it
[1:40:51] that our failings, our iniquities,
[1:40:55] &gt;&gt; our sins,
[1:40:58] how could that contribute to make him
[1:41:00] the masterpiece?
[1:41:03] And I've been pondering this very, very
[1:41:05] deeply and I'll tell you what I've can
[1:41:07] come to a conclusion.
[1:41:13] without what caused the flaw. We We
[1:41:15] caused the flaw.
[1:41:18] &gt;&gt; You agree with that?
[1:41:19] &gt;&gt; We caused the flaw,
[1:41:22] &gt;&gt; but it was the flaw that gave access to
[1:41:25] the attributes
[1:41:27] &gt;&gt; of Claw.
[1:41:30] &gt;&gt; Think about it now. The flaw
[1:41:32] &gt;&gt; gave access to the attributes because in
[1:41:35] the flaw was me or you as a sinner. But
[1:41:39] in the flaw then I could draw on the
[1:41:42] attributes of forgiveness.
[1:41:45] &gt;&gt; In the flaw was the sicknesses and
[1:41:47] diseases of the people. And in the flaw
[1:41:49] we could draw on the attributes of a
[1:41:51] healer.
[1:41:53] &gt;&gt; And the healer made him great. The
[1:41:55] healer made him. The forgiver, the
[1:41:57] savior made him great. And God God smold
[1:42:02] him
[1:42:02] &gt;&gt; so that out from God could come the
[1:42:05] attributes of God. Who could think of
[1:42:08] the long sufferings of God?
[1:42:11] &gt;&gt; Who could imagine his longsuffering?
[1:42:14] &gt;&gt; Who could imagine that kind of love?
[1:42:20] &gt;&gt; Someone who cursed and someone who
[1:42:23] damned God. Someone who hated Christ.
[1:42:27] And yet his love was greater than the
[1:42:30] hatred.
[1:42:32] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. and his love because he's a
[1:42:35] predestinated son and daughter of God
[1:42:37] living in his darkness living in this
[1:42:39] not only the slime pits but the swine
[1:42:42] pit
[1:42:48] &gt;&gt; are you with me
[1:42:54] &gt;&gt; and I have to bring something here
[1:42:58] &gt;&gt; and this is probably even more sensitive
[1:43:01] and more dangerous
[1:43:03] amongst believers. But the message has
[1:43:05] made us
[1:43:07] the message has has brought forth a
[1:43:09] super race has actually brought forth a
[1:43:11] a very very high standard of living
[1:43:14] people. People who live by a very high
[1:43:17] standard.
[1:43:18] &gt;&gt; But when if that should just become like
[1:43:20] a second nature to us and just we
[1:43:23] automatically do we we we do this. We
[1:43:25] wear our dresses a certain way. We wear
[1:43:28] our hair a certain way. We conduct
[1:43:30] ourselves a certain way. our homes are
[1:43:32] certain way because that's what we and
[1:43:34] that finally develops into a tradition.
[1:43:38] &gt;&gt; That tradition can become very dangerous
[1:43:42] &gt;&gt; because it's not something from the
[1:43:44] heart. It's not something alive. It's
[1:43:46] not vibrant. It's not the Holy Ghost.
[1:43:50] &gt;&gt; It's just something we learned.
[1:43:53] &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham said the priest and he
[1:43:55] had the priest. The priest was a good
[1:43:58] man. You couldn't even put your hand on
[1:43:59] it. couldn't lay a finger on his life
[1:44:02] and the woman at the well. And he's
[1:44:04] likening both of them to the same
[1:44:05] paragraph. He said the priest learned
[1:44:08] that the word of God was right. He
[1:44:10] learned that righteousness was correct.
[1:44:12] He learned that those things were right.
[1:44:14] And that's why he did it. But he said he
[1:44:17] had no representation.
[1:44:19] But the woman, she was lost. Had five
[1:44:21] husbands and living with the one now was
[1:44:24] not her husband. But she knew one thing.
[1:44:26] He said one thing. When the Messiah
[1:44:28] comes,
[1:44:29] [Applause]
[1:44:31] He will tell us all things.
[1:44:34] &gt;&gt; And she didn't need sermon. She didn't
[1:44:36] need a church to go to. As soon as he
[1:44:38] said it, she believed it.
[1:44:43] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:44:45] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:44:48] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:44:53] &gt;&gt; The flaw.
[1:44:55] &gt;&gt; I'm identified. You're identified in the
[1:44:57] flaw.
[1:45:05] And it gave access to the attributes of
[1:45:07] God.
[1:45:08] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:45:10] &gt;&gt; Part of the flaw was
[1:45:13] I personally
[1:45:15] had such confusion
[1:45:17] about the word of God. My confusion was
[1:45:20] in that flaw.
[1:45:21] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:45:22] &gt;&gt; Because I was in darkness.
[1:45:24] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:45:25] &gt;&gt; And many of you in some church and some
[1:45:27] religion And it's a dead religion. I
[1:45:30] marvel how the prophet of God spoke so
[1:45:34] harshly against denominationalism. Do
[1:45:36] you know why? Because denominationalism
[1:45:38] is not is not based on truth.
[1:45:42] &gt;&gt; It's based on a lie.
[1:45:45] &gt;&gt; And it has people believing in a
[1:45:47] multiplicity of gods, three gods, two
[1:45:49] gods, whatever more. Baptism, afraid of
[1:45:52] the name of Jesus Christ. What a
[1:45:54] darkness that is. Amen.
[1:45:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:45:58] &gt;&gt; True.
[1:45:59] &gt;&gt; I'm not here to be critical. I'm not
[1:46:01] here to be facicious. But every time I
[1:46:04] see you,
[1:46:06] &gt;&gt; God the Father, God the Son, and God the
[1:46:09] Holy Ghost,
[1:46:10] I say, "Which God are you talking about?
[1:46:14] &gt;&gt; Who is your God?
[1:46:16] &gt;&gt; Are you afraid of his name? Jesus
[1:46:18] Christ."
[1:46:19] &gt;&gt; In the name Jesus Christ.
[1:46:22] &gt;&gt; Of the Father and of the Son and of the
[1:46:25] Holy Ghost. and his name is the Lord
[1:46:27] Jesus Christ.
[1:46:30] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:46:31] &gt;&gt; We love that name.
[1:46:33] &gt;&gt; But my ignorance and my darkness and my
[1:46:37] confusion was in that flaw.
[1:46:40] &gt;&gt; And how I thank God for his patience.
[1:46:43] &gt;&gt; How I thank God for his attribute of
[1:46:46] revelation.
[1:46:48] &gt;&gt; Did you need revelation?
[1:46:49] [Music]
[1:46:51] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. If you haven't received it
[1:46:53] yet, don't stop at nothing
[1:46:57] &gt;&gt; till you have it as a living revelation
[1:46:59] within you.
[1:47:01] &gt;&gt; See yourself in the flaw.
[1:47:03] &gt;&gt; The flaw is yours.
[1:47:05] &gt;&gt; But the flaw made him greater.
[1:47:08] &gt;&gt; And when God saw that perfect lamb of
[1:47:10] God who had crossed over,
[1:47:12] &gt;&gt; he stro smoked him.
[1:47:16] &gt;&gt; Why? Because he had to die to go the
[1:47:19] full distance.
[1:47:23] Yes, sir.
[1:47:24] &gt;&gt; He had to go further in dying. He went
[1:47:27] to hell
[1:47:29] &gt;&gt; where you and I were destined to go.
[1:47:32] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And he emptied it out before
[1:47:35] you even got there.
[1:47:39] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:47:40] &gt;&gt; He emptied out paradise.
[1:47:44] &gt;&gt; Glory to God.
[1:47:46] &gt;&gt; Why did this masterpiece message have to
[1:47:48] be preached in this time? because he was
[1:47:52] made known
[1:47:53] &gt;&gt; in perfection.
[1:47:55] &gt;&gt; This message in the revelation of this
[1:47:57] message is a perfect revelation of the
[1:48:01] word of God.
[1:48:02] &gt;&gt; Now, I want you to believe that one.
[1:48:05] &gt;&gt; It may not You may not have a perfect
[1:48:07] understanding, but this message is a
[1:48:09] perfect revelation. There will not be
[1:48:11] another one.
[1:48:12] &gt;&gt; There's not another messenger.
[1:48:15] &gt;&gt; Excuse me raising my voice, but I want
[1:48:17] to get it through to you. There's not
[1:48:19] another messenger coming.
[1:48:21] &gt;&gt; There's not an eighth one.
[1:48:23] &gt;&gt; The seventh one, the last one. The
[1:48:27] others were reformers. This one was a
[1:48:29] prophet.
[1:48:30] &gt;&gt; There's nothing more coming.
[1:48:34] &gt;&gt; Settle it in your mind. There's nothing
[1:48:35] more coming.
[1:48:37] &gt;&gt; This is it.
[1:48:44] [Music]
[1:48:47] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:48:48] But once you see yourself,
[1:48:52] I'm not so worried about the bad people,
[1:48:54] people who live with big problems.
[1:49:05] I I've counseledled much of my life.
[1:49:13] You listening?
[1:49:17] And almost all of them,
[1:49:20] 99.9%
[1:49:22] in fact is is that they have a problem.
[1:49:26] They have a weakness. They have a
[1:49:29] prevailing
[1:49:31] unbelief or sin or something that
[1:49:35] they've done or something they're
[1:49:36] tempted, some temptation or something
[1:49:40] and we seek to bring them. I don't
[1:49:43] recall anyone ever coming to me and
[1:49:45] saying, "Brother Ed, my problem is I'm
[1:49:49] just too good.
[1:49:55] I'm just too good.
[1:49:58] And being so good, I don't feel a need.
[1:50:02] Being so good, I don't I don't feel
[1:50:05] conviction. I've been a good boy. I've
[1:50:07] been a good man. I've been a good
[1:50:09] father. I've been
[1:50:14] I've been a good wife, been a good
[1:50:16] mother, I've been a good young lady.
[1:50:20] I've just been too good, but I'm still
[1:50:23] missing something.
[1:50:27] That's the most dangerous spot.
[1:50:31] &gt;&gt; I'm a good believer. I'm a good church
[1:50:34] member.
[1:50:34] &gt;&gt; I'm there all the time. I pay my tithes.
[1:50:37] &gt;&gt; I do what I'm supposed to do. It's just
[1:50:40] like clockwork.
[1:50:41] &gt;&gt; I do I I live by the message of the best
[1:50:44] I know how to do. No,
[1:50:50] &gt;&gt; that's the danger spot.
[1:50:52] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:50:54] &gt;&gt; This morning, I want the good people
[1:50:56] to look at that terrible wounding and
[1:50:59] have and find where find where where the
[1:51:02] prophet of God describes his suffering.
[1:51:04] &gt;&gt; Yes. how he was brutalized and spit
[1:51:07] hanging on his beard and his ribs
[1:51:10] sticking out and a mass he said just a
[1:51:14] mass of bloody flesh.
[1:51:17] &gt;&gt; And then you say to yourself, that's
[1:51:19] because of me.
[1:51:21] &gt;&gt; I did that.
[1:51:23] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:51:23] &gt;&gt; I did that.
[1:51:26] &gt;&gt; And you won't feel very righteous.
[1:51:30] But when you say because
[1:51:33] because I'm identified in that mar
[1:51:36] &gt;&gt; hallelujah
[1:51:37] &gt;&gt; I have access
[1:51:40] &gt;&gt; I'm so glad you've been patient.
[1:51:43] &gt;&gt; So glad you found me as they sang today.
[1:51:46] So glad you found me. So glad you drew
[1:51:49] me. So glad you wooed. So glad that you
[1:51:53] kept speaking. Even when I didn't make a
[1:51:56] move, you kept speaking. You kept
[1:51:58] speaking. So glad you kept drawing me.
[1:52:02] Oh God.
[1:52:05] &gt;&gt; So glad.
[1:52:07] &gt;&gt; So glad you're longsuffering.
[1:52:10] &gt;&gt; So glad you didn't give up.
[1:52:14] [Applause]
[1:52:15] &gt;&gt; So glad you stayed there.
[1:52:20] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:52:24] &gt;&gt; It was Jesus who walked with the good
[1:52:26] people.
[1:52:28] And Jesus said to the good people, Jesus
[1:52:31] said to the believers, "Oh fools
[1:52:36] &gt;&gt; and slow of heart to believe all that
[1:52:40] the prophets have spoken."
[1:52:42] &gt;&gt; What to God
[1:52:46] suggested? Perhaps I should have just
[1:52:48] gone to my glory and forgotten all of
[1:52:51] this.
[1:52:53] &gt;&gt; But he stayed with them.
[1:52:56] He was determined.
[1:52:58] &gt;&gt; Perhaps two young men like you young
[1:53:00] fellows here,
[1:53:03] full of zeal,
[1:53:05] hung in there,
[1:53:07] stayed at the cross, was so disappointed
[1:53:11] in all that happened, but they thought
[1:53:12] the whole message had fallen apart. I
[1:53:14] can tell you the message hasn't fallen
[1:53:16] apart.
[1:53:18] [Music]
[1:53:20] &gt;&gt; The message is strong. The message is a
[1:53:23] pure vindicated word of God. I don't
[1:53:27] care what you see. I don't care where
[1:53:29] you where you look. But the word of God
[1:53:32] is absolutely flawless.
[1:53:35] [Music]
[1:53:38] &gt;&gt; This message came to make Christ known
[1:53:40] to you.
[1:53:41] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:53:43] &gt;&gt; This a flawless word.
[1:53:45] &gt;&gt; I hear people say message the message is
[1:53:47] a mess. I deny that. The message is the
[1:53:50] spotless bride of Jesus Christ.
[1:53:58] &gt;&gt; And the prophet of God has said if you
[1:54:00] believe the prophet of God that he's
[1:54:01] raised himself up another masterpiece.
[1:54:05] &gt;&gt; And if he the man was a masterpiece, she
[1:54:08] the woman must also be the masterpiece.
[1:54:11] &gt;&gt; She is a masterpiece.
[1:54:14] Yes, he is.
[1:54:14] &gt;&gt; Just turn aside from all the negative
[1:54:17] things that you may see
[1:54:18] &gt;&gt; or you may come in contact with. Just
[1:54:21] turn it aside. Say it has no part of me.
[1:54:33] flaw
[1:54:35] gave access to his attributes.
[1:54:40] &gt;&gt; We were identified with him
[1:54:43] in the flaw.
[1:54:47] A part of our life caused the flaw
[1:54:51] and the flaw made him the masterpiece.
[1:54:53] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:55:02] How would you like this attribute?
[1:55:07] There is therefore now
[1:55:10] &gt;&gt; no
[1:55:12] &gt;&gt; condemnation
[1:55:14] &gt;&gt; to them which are in Christ Jesus.
[1:55:17] &gt;&gt; How can you have any condemnation in
[1:55:19] Christ Jesus? There is none in him.
[1:55:22] [Music]
[1:55:24] &gt;&gt; There is therefore say amen.
[1:55:28] Now,
[1:55:29] &gt;&gt; amen. No condemnation to them which are
[1:55:33] in Christ Jesus, who walk not after the
[1:55:35] spirit, who walk not after the flesh,
[1:55:38] but after the spirit.
[1:55:39] &gt;&gt; You're here because you're walking after
[1:55:41] the spirit. That's why you're here.
[1:55:46] &gt;&gt; You're not here just to hear some good
[1:55:48] things or some nice things.
[1:55:51] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:55:52] &gt;&gt; Now, here's some things. I decided I
[1:55:54] would
[1:55:55] say some things to you and quote some
[1:55:57] things which are well known to you but I
[1:56:01] want you to think them and digest them
[1:56:04] together with me.
[1:56:05] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:56:06] &gt;&gt; You know what the blood now we're
[1:56:08] talking about the mar and we're talking
[1:56:10] about the attribute
[1:56:13] as we saw the mar I'm identified with
[1:56:16] the mar. I don't have any problem
[1:56:17] identifying with Jesus Christ, the the
[1:56:20] crucified one, the perfect one, the
[1:56:23] spotless lamb of God.
[1:56:25] &gt;&gt; Don't have any trouble identifying. But
[1:56:27] then when I see the mar and see the
[1:56:29] spear
[1:56:30] &gt;&gt; and see the blood and water coming out
[1:56:33] &gt;&gt; and saying, Edis, you did that.
[1:56:37] &gt;&gt; You did that. You're part of that.
[1:56:40] &gt;&gt; He died for you.
[1:56:44] &gt;&gt; You have to say that. You
[1:56:46] &gt;&gt; if you're not identified with the mar,
[1:56:48] you're not identified with the
[1:56:49] attributes that came as a result of it.
[1:56:55] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:56:56] &gt;&gt; He said, you know what the blood of
[1:56:58] Christ does
[1:57:00] &gt;&gt; now? If he had if there hadn't been a
[1:57:01] mar, there wouldn't be any blood.
[1:57:03] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:57:06] &gt;&gt; So my mar, your mar,
[1:57:09] &gt;&gt; our part in the flaw brought forth the
[1:57:12] blood. Amen.
[1:57:15] &gt;&gt; And here's what we say about the blood.
[1:57:17] Here's what a prophet says about the
[1:57:19] blood. Do you know what the blood of
[1:57:21] Christ does to confess sin?
[1:57:24] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:57:26] &gt;&gt; Could you imagine having a wash tub full
[1:57:30] of bleach
[1:57:31] &gt;&gt; and a little eyropper
[1:57:34] &gt;&gt; full of ink
[1:57:35] &gt;&gt; and you drop it this ink down into the
[1:57:38] wash tub? You've heard it before. But
[1:57:41] now I don't want you just to hear it. I
[1:57:43] want you to walk with it. I want you to
[1:57:45] digest it word by word and line by line.
[1:57:48] And you you drop the drop of ink in in
[1:57:52] the wash tub full of bleach. What
[1:57:54] happens to the ink? That's the question.
[1:57:57] &gt;&gt; What happens to the ink?
[1:58:00] &gt;&gt; My ink caused the flaw.
[1:58:02] &gt;&gt; My ink, your ink caused the flaw. What
[1:58:06] happens to the ink when you confess it?
[1:58:09] When you look upon him and say, "That
[1:58:12] was me. I am the sinner.
[1:58:14] &gt;&gt; I recognize you as a lamb of God. I
[1:58:18] confess my sin. I don't want to have any
[1:58:21] more to do with this life."
[1:58:25] &gt;&gt; When he said the ink becomes bleach,
[1:58:30] &gt;&gt; how can my ink become bleach?
[1:58:33] &gt;&gt; We don't understand the power of the
[1:58:35] attribute.
[1:58:38] The attribute crossed the whole
[1:58:40] distance.
[1:58:44] &gt;&gt; I could say it, but I'll read it.
[1:58:47] &gt;&gt; He asked, "What happened?"
[1:58:50] &gt;&gt; He said, "It doesn't hurt the bleach a
[1:58:52] bit."
[1:58:53] &gt;&gt; When the ink hit the bleach, when your
[1:58:55] sin hit the bleach, when your when your
[1:58:58] sin hit the blood, it didn't hurt the
[1:59:00] blood at all.
[1:59:03] &gt;&gt; What happened?
[1:59:04] [Applause]
[1:59:05] The blood didn't go into shock waves.
[1:59:08] &gt;&gt; The blood didn't go into some kind of
[1:59:10] spasm.
[1:59:12] &gt;&gt; The blood was made to take care of it.
[1:59:18] [Music]
[1:59:22] &gt;&gt; It doesn't hurt the bleach a bit. It
[1:59:24] just takes on and becomes bleach.
[1:59:29] &gt;&gt; What is the bleach?
[1:59:31] &gt;&gt; Righteousness.
[1:59:33] You say, "Explain that." I can't explain
[1:59:36] that.
[1:59:38] &gt;&gt; You can't explain that. That's what
[1:59:41] God's word is saying to you.
[1:59:47] &gt;&gt; And he says it becomes bleach. And
[1:59:49] that's what confessed sin does.
[1:59:53] When it's confessed upon the blood of
[1:59:56] Jesus Christ, it changes its color and
[2:00:00] becomes righteousness.
[2:00:02] [Applause]
[2:00:07] [Music]
[2:00:16] You'll never you'll never be able to
[2:00:19] explain that.
[2:00:21] &gt;&gt; You better just believe it.
[2:00:24] &gt;&gt; Otherwise, if you leave it hanging out
[2:00:26] here, Satan's got something to come and
[2:00:28] work on.
[2:00:30] &gt;&gt; It's not finished. It's not done. And to
[2:00:33] come and say, "Remember that." And you
[2:00:35] have a right to say, "I can't remember
[2:00:37] it. God can't remember it." And
[2:00:40] furthermore, it can't even be found. It
[2:00:43] cannot be found.
[2:00:46] And if you can find it, you're an
[2:00:47] instrument of Satan because you become
[2:00:50] part of the accusers's plan. I'll have
[2:00:54] nothing to do with the accuser.
[2:00:57] It can't be found.
[2:00:59] [Applause]
[2:01:01] God can't find it.
[2:01:10] [Applause]
[2:01:16] [Music]
[2:01:17] Yes, sir.
[2:01:17] &gt;&gt; If you see something different, you got
[2:01:19] a prophet to deal with.
[2:01:23] &gt;&gt; If you got a feeling that's adverse to
[2:01:25] this,
[2:01:27] &gt;&gt; you're in a dangerous spot.
[2:01:31] &gt;&gt; And that's not just one time. That's not
[2:01:33] just one quote.
[2:01:34] He says that in the message look
[2:01:38] &gt;&gt; and I'd like you to look.
[2:01:39] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[2:01:40] &gt;&gt; He says that one drop of ink
[2:01:42] &gt;&gt; can sign your death warrant.
[2:01:45] &gt;&gt; It can send you to the electric chair.
[2:01:49] &gt;&gt; Or that one drop of ink can pardon you
[2:01:51] from your sins.
[2:01:53] &gt;&gt; It was sent here for a purpose
[2:01:56] &gt;&gt; and we got to use it for the right
[2:01:58] thing. But for instance, it's finished.
[2:02:01] &gt;&gt; And we drop that one drop of ink into a
[2:02:04] tub of bleach.
[2:02:05] &gt;&gt; What happens to it?
[2:02:07] &gt;&gt; You don't see nothing happen.
[2:02:10] &gt;&gt; You don't see anything happen. You can't
[2:02:12] decipher and determine and analyze
[2:02:15] what's happening.
[2:02:16] &gt;&gt; But it he says what and you see nothing
[2:02:19] happen. But there's no more color.
[2:02:23] &gt;&gt; It was black ink, but now there's no
[2:02:26] more color. He's taking it from a
[2:02:28] different side. There's no more color.
[2:02:30] The color breaks up.
[2:02:32] &gt;&gt; The sin breaks up.
[2:02:33] &gt;&gt; The iniquity breaks up.
[2:02:36] &gt;&gt; Everything that caused the mar breaks
[2:02:38] up.
[2:02:40] [Applause]
[2:02:43] &gt;&gt; And you don't know where it went.
[2:02:46] [Applause]
[2:02:48] &gt;&gt; You ask me why I'm happy.
[2:02:50] &gt;&gt; So I'll just tell you why.
[2:02:53] &gt;&gt; My sins are gone.
[2:02:56] They're buried in the sea of God's
[2:02:58] forgetfulness.
[2:03:00] &gt;&gt; He can't remember them. The very mind of
[2:03:02] God who conceived my being here can't
[2:03:06] remember it.
[2:03:08] &gt;&gt; That is beyond our understanding.
[2:03:12] &gt;&gt; That God can forget it.
[2:03:15] &gt;&gt; God can decree to forget it.
[2:03:19] &gt;&gt; He has decreed to forget it. Amen.
[2:03:23] &gt;&gt; And I've had people who have whimpered
[2:03:25] and cried and and and pleaded with God
[2:03:29] over their failures and over their sin
[2:03:32] and over their past and all of these
[2:03:35] things. And when they heard when they
[2:03:37] heard there was one sister and she lived
[2:03:39] for years years under condemnation
[2:03:44] &gt;&gt; and she was sad
[2:03:47] and she'd go into very
[2:03:50] terrible
[2:03:51] fits of depression.
[2:03:56] And furthermore, this surprised her. She
[2:03:58] lived in our home with us
[2:04:02] and she would go into those and they
[2:04:03] would last for several days.
[2:04:07] And finally one day my wife just said to
[2:04:10] her
[2:04:15] even just talking to that spirit
[2:04:18] that spirit wanted to bring others down
[2:04:20] with it.
[2:04:24] &gt;&gt; I'm in a pout and I want everybody else
[2:04:26] to be in a pout. I've lost the victory
[2:04:28] and I want a whole bunch of people to
[2:04:30] sympathize with me. I'm going to make
[2:04:32] this home as miserable as I can.
[2:04:35] &gt;&gt; That's a devil.
[2:04:37] &gt;&gt; Don't you dare give in to that devil.
[2:04:40] &gt;&gt; And if he can bring an accusation
[2:04:42] against you, that's exactly what he
[2:04:44] wants to do.
[2:04:45] &gt;&gt; He wants to bring you down.
[2:04:47] &gt;&gt; And so said to this one one person, she
[2:04:50] said, "Begin to relate all the things."
[2:04:53] And said,
[2:04:55] "No,
[2:04:56] there's no use talking to God about it
[2:04:58] because he can't remember it. Right?
[2:05:02] &gt;&gt; No use going in prayer saying, "God, I
[2:05:05] did this and God, I did that."
[2:05:08] &gt;&gt; That's not the question. God wants to
[2:05:10] say, "Did you confess it?"
[2:05:12] &gt;&gt; You confessed it. I can't remember it.
[2:05:15] &gt;&gt; It doesn't exist. In fact, it doesn't
[2:05:18] exist.
[2:05:20] &gt;&gt; How does it become righteous? If you let
[2:05:22] God deal with it the way it should be
[2:05:24] dealt with, you'll be a better person
[2:05:26] for the kingdom of God. It'll turn that
[2:05:29] thing into righteousness.
[2:05:35] &gt;&gt; How else you going to make that? It'll
[2:05:36] turn it into righteousness.
[2:05:39] &gt;&gt; Do you hear me? It'll turn it into
[2:05:41] righteousness.
[2:05:43] &gt;&gt; You'll be a different person, a
[2:05:45] different man, a different woman.
[2:05:48] [Applause]
[2:05:53] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[2:05:54] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:05:55] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[2:05:58] I'm going to say things I've never said
[2:06:00] before. I had there's been a lot of
[2:06:02] people that have moved in here to the
[2:06:04] church over the many, many years and
[2:06:07] been blessed and very dear friends,
[2:06:10] wonderful, wonderful
[2:06:13] families,
[2:06:15] wonderful individuals. I had a pastor
[2:06:17] call me many years ago
[2:06:20] and said these people this that this
[2:06:24] that the other thing this that and
[2:06:27] related off a whole horror story and
[2:06:30] said and he said I will send you an
[2:06:32] airplane ticket so you can fly down here
[2:06:35] so I can tell you what these people are
[2:06:37] like.
[2:06:39] I thanked him
[2:06:42] but refused it. And I can tell you those
[2:06:45] people are some of the finest believers
[2:06:48] you could ever see in this world.
[2:06:52] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:06:54] &gt;&gt; Why would a minister even want to talk
[2:06:56] about
[2:06:57] &gt;&gt; things that have things that went into
[2:06:58] the tub of bleach?
[2:07:00] &gt;&gt; Didn't go into the tub of bleach, but
[2:07:02] went into this perfect lamb of God.
[2:07:04] &gt;&gt; And the blood that came out of his body
[2:07:06] and the sin that fell into that can't be
[2:07:09] found anymore. And it broke up its
[2:07:11] collar. It broke up. It's it's
[2:07:14] chemistry. It broke it up completely and
[2:07:17] became righteousness.
[2:07:24] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:07:28] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:07:30] &gt;&gt; Yes, Lord.
[2:07:32] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:07:50] The
[2:07:50] &gt;&gt; Bible says, "None are righteous, know
[2:07:52] not one."
[2:07:54] &gt;&gt; None are righteous.
[2:08:02] &gt;&gt; Now, to be a Christian, I'm coming to a
[2:08:05] close.
[2:08:07] Now to be a Christian,
[2:08:09] you have to be the same.
[2:08:12] All that he was.
[2:08:16] &gt;&gt; I'm identified.
[2:08:18] &gt;&gt; I'm identified with the flaw, but I'm
[2:08:20] also identified with the blood.
[2:08:24] &gt;&gt; I'm identified with the bleach.
[2:08:26] &gt;&gt; And all of my past went to the bleach.
[2:08:29] &gt;&gt; All of your past went to the bleach. And
[2:08:31] God help you if it hasn't gone to the
[2:08:33] bleach. What do I need to do, brother
[2:08:34] Bisco? What do I need to do? just
[2:08:36] confess it.
[2:08:39] &gt;&gt; You know how big a problem that is?
[2:08:42] Brother Brandham has people in front of
[2:08:43] him and he says, "Do you believe?"
[2:08:47] &gt;&gt; And they say, "Yes, I do." And you know
[2:08:49] what his next words are? God bless you.
[2:08:53] [Music]
[2:08:55] &gt;&gt; You'll never hear him once say, "Well, I
[2:08:58] don't know about that."
[2:09:02] &gt;&gt; Are you sure?
[2:09:04] Are you sure you've confessed it?
[2:09:07] &gt;&gt; Are you sure? You'll never hear him say
[2:09:09] that. Find me the quote.
[2:09:11] &gt;&gt; He'll say, "God bless you."
[2:09:13] &gt;&gt; You're blessed of God.
[2:09:16] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:09:18] Amen.
[2:09:26] &gt;&gt; And he says
[2:09:29] now to be a true Christian
[2:09:33] all that he was. I'm identified with
[2:09:35] him.
[2:09:36] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:09:37] &gt;&gt; And he is in me.
[2:09:39] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:09:40] &gt;&gt; The congregation should say, "Thanks be
[2:09:42] to God.
[2:09:44] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. He is in me.
[2:09:47] &gt;&gt; The marred one.
[2:09:49] &gt;&gt; The one that the lamb in Exodus couldn't
[2:09:51] do.
[2:09:52] &gt;&gt; Isaac couldn't do it.
[2:09:53] &gt;&gt; This one crossed over. The almighty
[2:09:56] divine one came down
[2:09:58] &gt;&gt; and found me.
[2:10:03] &gt;&gt; And when he came personally to me, I
[2:10:05] could say, "Forgive me.
[2:10:10] &gt;&gt; I'm sorry. Hallelujah.
[2:10:13] &gt;&gt; I hate this thing about me.
[2:10:16] &gt;&gt; I hate this weakness.
[2:10:18] &gt;&gt; This iniquity,
[2:10:20] &gt;&gt; this temptation, all of this weakness,
[2:10:23] this I don't want it. Remove it from me.
[2:10:27] &gt;&gt; When you confess it, it dropped
[2:10:30] &gt;&gt; into the bleach.
[2:10:32] &gt;&gt; If we don't have that, I don't have that
[2:10:35] quote. If I don't have that quote, I
[2:10:37] don't have a message. If we don't have a
[2:10:40] message, I'm done with the ministry.
[2:10:43] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:10:44] &gt;&gt; This is a message of power.
[2:10:46] &gt;&gt; This is a message of hope.
[2:10:48] &gt;&gt; This is a message of faith.
[2:10:51] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. This is a message. This is
[2:10:53] the resurrection message.
[2:10:56] [Applause]
[2:11:00] &gt;&gt; I'm beyond playing church, friends.
[2:11:02] &gt;&gt; I'm beyond playing games. Anybody
[2:11:04] doesn't want this word, I say, have a
[2:11:06] happy tribulation.
[2:11:08] cuz you certainly will be in a
[2:11:10] tribulation.
[2:11:14] [Applause]
[2:11:16] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. I'm having a hard time
[2:11:18] slowing down.
[2:11:21] &gt;&gt; He's in me
[2:11:22] &gt;&gt; and I'm in him.
[2:11:24] &gt;&gt; Then every Christian that's a real
[2:11:26] genuine Christian was with him.
[2:11:28] &gt;&gt; When the morning stars sang together,
[2:11:31] &gt;&gt; were you there?
[2:11:33] &gt;&gt; I was in him when the morning stars sang
[2:11:35] together.
[2:11:36] And when the sons of God shouted for
[2:11:39] joy, and that's why I'm still shouting
[2:11:41] for joy,
[2:11:44] &gt;&gt; I did it then, I do it now. And I do it
[2:11:47] now, and I'll do it again. Hallelujah.
[2:11:51] We'll rejoice together. And the sons of
[2:11:54] God and daughters of God shouted for
[2:11:57] joy.
[2:11:59] [Music]
[2:12:01] Hallelujah.
[2:12:04] Glory, brother Peter. Hallelujah.
[2:12:14] &gt;&gt; Before there was a foundation of the
[2:12:15] world,
[2:12:16] &gt;&gt; we were identified in the immortal
[2:12:19] realms and God 10 million years before
[2:12:22] the world was ever formed.
[2:12:24] &gt;&gt; If I've got eternal life, I was with him
[2:12:27] there. I was with Joseph when he was
[2:12:30] rejected
[2:12:31] &gt;&gt; of his brothers because he was spiritual
[2:12:34] and the rest of them was carnal. I was
[2:12:37] with him when he knew the reproach to
[2:12:39] stand by his own brothers. What's he
[2:12:41] saying? I was in the flaw.
[2:12:45] &gt;&gt; I'm identified with the rejection.
[2:12:48] &gt;&gt; I'm identified when he was despised.
[2:12:53] [Applause]
[2:12:53] [Music]
[2:12:55] &gt;&gt; What he was, I am. And what I am, he
[2:12:59] was. I was with Jacob that night that he
[2:13:02] wrestled all night. Jacob the shyster.
[2:13:05] Jacob the cheater. Jacob, I was with him
[2:13:08] and he wrestled all night with the
[2:13:10] angel. I've wrestled myself.
[2:13:14] &gt;&gt; I know what he spent went through. So I
[2:13:17] wrestled with Jacob the same time he did
[2:13:19] for I'm his brother.
[2:13:21] &gt;&gt; I was with Moses when he went down into
[2:13:24] Egypt. I was with Moses at the burning
[2:13:27] bush. If you're a Christian, you're
[2:13:29] identified with the Bible characters.
[2:13:32] And don't forget it.
[2:13:36] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:13:37] &gt;&gt; You're at the burning bush. Don't forget
[2:13:39] it.
[2:13:41] &gt;&gt; You're with Jacob wrestling with the
[2:13:42] angel. Why? Because you wrestled with
[2:13:45] the same angel.
[2:13:49] [Applause]
[2:13:54] I was with Daniel
[2:13:56] &gt;&gt; in the lion's den.
[2:13:59] &gt;&gt; I was with the Hebrew children in the
[2:14:01] fiery furnace
[2:14:02] &gt;&gt; when the fire couldn't burn them because
[2:14:04] of the presence of the fourth man of the
[2:14:06] lion.
[2:14:08] &gt;&gt; Why can you write a song? You were
[2:14:10] there.
[2:14:15] &gt;&gt; They wouldn't bend. They wouldn't bow.
[2:14:19] They wouldn't burn.
[2:14:21] You won't bend. You have not bowed and
[2:14:25] you shall not burn.
[2:14:28] [Applause]
[2:14:46] Because I was in the flaw, I'll be where
[2:14:49] he is on the throne.
[2:14:52] &gt;&gt; You'll be with me
[2:14:54] &gt;&gt; in my father's house.
[2:14:59] [Applause]
[2:15:02] &gt;&gt; I most surely
[2:15:04] &gt;&gt; was with him at Calvary.
[2:15:06] [Applause]
[2:15:08] I must be identified with him at
[2:15:10] Calvary, I must be there to a place
[2:15:13] &gt;&gt; that where not also I was identified
[2:15:15] with him at Calvary, I died with him at
[2:15:17] Calvary.
[2:15:19] &gt;&gt; Every Christian must die with him at
[2:15:20] Calvary.
[2:15:22] &gt;&gt; If you don't die with him at Calvary,
[2:15:24] you can't be none of his.
[2:15:27] &gt;&gt; I was there when he died and I died with
[2:15:30] him.
[2:15:32] &gt;&gt; You did.
[2:15:34] &gt;&gt; Is this just a word? Is this just a
[2:15:36] theory? Is this a reality?
[2:15:38] &gt;&gt; I died with him.
[2:15:41] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:15:43] &gt;&gt; In him. You died for your sins.
[2:15:47] &gt;&gt; He died for you.
[2:15:49] &gt;&gt; You were in him.
[2:15:51] &gt;&gt; G.
[2:15:52] &gt;&gt; And then I was with him
[2:15:54] &gt;&gt; when he raised up from the dead.
[2:15:57] &gt;&gt; I came up on Easter morning with him
[2:15:59] &gt;&gt; in the resurrection.
[2:16:02] &gt;&gt; Whatever he did, I was right there with
[2:16:04] him.
[2:16:05] Every believer was with him. I tell you
[2:16:07] what, friends, I'm leaving this here. I
[2:16:09] was with him when he stood as a platform
[2:16:13] &gt;&gt; and spoke through his own servant. I was
[2:16:16] with him when the prophet God spoke.
[2:16:20] &gt;&gt; I was standing with brother Brandham
[2:16:22] when he spoke because I believe those
[2:16:25] words.
[2:16:28] Hallelujah.
[2:16:29] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:16:31] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:16:33] And what he is, I am.
[2:16:36] &gt;&gt; I am.
[2:16:37] &gt;&gt; And what I am, he is.
[2:16:40] &gt;&gt; We partaken of his grace.
[2:16:43] &gt;&gt; Of his forgiveness, of his
[2:16:45] longsuffering, of his mercies
[2:16:48] [Applause]
[2:16:49] &gt;&gt; and new every day.
[2:16:52] &gt;&gt; Don't forget this service. When you
[2:16:53] leave this place and if anything comes
[2:16:56] haunting you and tries to say something
[2:16:58] different to you, you say, "Get behind
[2:17:01] me, Satan. Go back to the pit.
[2:17:10] &gt;&gt; My life stands before God,
[2:17:13] &gt;&gt; whiter than the driven snow."
[2:17:17] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:17:19] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:17:20] &gt;&gt; What does this do? Not to make you feel
[2:17:22] good, to glorify Calvary,
[2:17:25] &gt;&gt; to make the cross greater,
[2:17:27] &gt;&gt; to make his suffering greater,
[2:17:29] &gt;&gt; because through his wound came the
[2:17:31] attribute
[2:17:35] &gt;&gt; and turn my sin
[2:17:37] &gt;&gt; to righteousness.
[2:17:40] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Jesus.
[2:17:45] &gt;&gt; You'll never hear that
[2:17:48] &gt;&gt; in any denominational church.
[2:17:50] &gt;&gt; That's right. You'll never hear such
[2:17:52] words of power
[2:17:54] &gt;&gt; as spoken by this messenger.
[2:17:57] &gt;&gt; You'll never hear
[2:17:59] &gt;&gt; that your sin was ink and dropped into a
[2:18:02] tub of bleach and lost its color and
[2:18:05] lost its entire makeup and lost its
[2:18:08] chemistry and lost everything and cannot
[2:18:11] be found by almighty God. You'll never
[2:18:13] find it again.
[2:18:15] [Applause]
[2:18:19] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:18:21] [Music]
[2:18:28] And I close with this.
[2:18:32] If you become inspired
[2:18:35] to find something that already has been
[2:18:40] completely
[2:18:43] annihilated
[2:18:45] in the precious blood, whether it's your
[2:18:47] own faults,
[2:18:50] your own weaknesses, your own failures,
[2:18:55] your own sin or iniquity, whatever I
[2:18:58] call it that because that's what Satan
[2:19:00] would like to call it.
[2:19:02] Or if you find it in yourself or you
[2:19:05] find it in someone else or you find it
[2:19:08] in your husband or your wife,
[2:19:11] you're in dangerous ground.
[2:19:12] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[2:19:14] &gt;&gt; You find it in a brother or you find it
[2:19:16] in a sister.
[2:19:17] &gt;&gt; Say, "What business is that?" None of
[2:19:19] our business between them and God.
[2:19:21] &gt;&gt; And you know what the prophet will say?
[2:19:23] Pray for them. Pray for them. What would
[2:19:26] happen if this whole church began to
[2:19:28] pray for people? Pray for that brother.
[2:19:31] Pray for that sister.
[2:19:34] &gt;&gt; You think they had a telephone hook up
[2:19:36] there and said, "You know what? This
[2:19:38] this blah blah blah all this thing that
[2:19:41] is absolutely absolutely outside of the
[2:19:44] realm of God.
[2:19:46] &gt;&gt; All God knows about is I stretched my
[2:19:48] tent.
[2:19:49] &gt;&gt; I came the whole distance. I came
[2:19:52] without blemish. I crossed over
[2:19:55] &gt;&gt; the whole distance."
[2:19:58] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:20:00] Amen.
[2:20:01] &gt;&gt; He crossed over the whole distance.
[2:20:04] &gt;&gt; He reached even to you.
[2:20:08] &gt;&gt; Isn't it wonderful?
[2:20:10] &gt;&gt; He crossed over.
[2:20:12] [Music]
[2:20:14] &gt;&gt; Even to you.
[2:20:16] [Applause]
[2:20:20] &gt;&gt; There's a wonderful
[2:20:22] &gt;&gt; I tell you what, friends. I'm having a
[2:20:24] revival.
[2:20:25] &gt;&gt; He crossed over. Glory to God.
[2:20:33] &gt;&gt; And you know what he said? It is
[2:20:35] finished.
[2:20:37] &gt;&gt; It's done.
[2:20:38] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. It's done.
[2:20:42] &gt;&gt; And the prophet of God even went
[2:20:44] further. He said, "It's gone.
[2:20:48] It's gone.
[2:20:50] It's gone. Never to come back."
[2:20:54] Glory to God. Glory to God.
[2:21:00] [Applause]
[2:21:10] [Applause]
[2:21:20] [Applause]
[2:21:21] I'm amazed.
[2:21:26] Oh, I'm amazed that he cared.
[2:21:31] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:21:33] [Applause]
[2:21:36] You want to sing,
[2:21:38] &gt;&gt; you want to rejoice, let's say, thank
[2:21:41] you, Lord Jesus.
[2:21:43] &gt;&gt; Thank you, oh God.
[2:21:45] [Applause]
[2:21:46] [Music]
[2:21:48] [Applause]
[2:21:50] [Music]
[2:21:53] [Applause]
[2:21:55] &gt;&gt; Glory, glory,
[2:21:58] hallelujah, hallelujah.
[2:22:03] Hallelujah.
[2:22:06] &gt;&gt; Oh, thank you.
[2:22:10] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord Jesus.
[2:22:16] [Music]
[2:22:22] [Applause]
[2:22:27] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:22:29] [Applause]
[2:22:31] Hallelujah.
[2:22:33] Thank you Lord Jesus. Hallelujah Lord.
[2:22:38] [Music]
[2:22:48] &gt;&gt; I'm amazed. Let's sing it. I'm amazed
[2:22:50] that he loved me.
[2:22:52] &gt;&gt; Glory.
[2:22:57] [Music]
[2:22:59] &gt;&gt; We praise you Lord. Heat.
[2:23:04] Heat.

[2:27:08] Heat. Heat.
[2:27:12] [Music]
[2:27:19] Mothers, mothers, fathers, families,
[2:27:22] children. Some that are not here.
[2:27:26] Some that are perhaps still in darkness.
[2:27:29] Some that still need to identify with
[2:27:31] the mar, the wound, the flaw. Some that
[2:27:34] still need to be awakened.
[2:27:37] &gt;&gt; All things are possible
[2:27:40] &gt;&gt; to them that believe.
[2:27:42] &gt;&gt; I call on mothers to believe.
[2:27:44] &gt;&gt; I call on fathers to believe. that at
[2:27:47] that gathering the circle shall not be
[2:27:50] broken.
[2:27:53] &gt;&gt; I refuse to give the enemy
[2:27:56] &gt;&gt; any I refuse to give him a thought a
[2:27:59] space in my mind.
[2:28:02] &gt;&gt; We claim them.
[2:28:04] &gt;&gt; We claim them.
[2:28:05] &gt;&gt; We claim them
[2:28:07] &gt;&gt; in the name of Jesus Christ.
[2:28:09] &gt;&gt; And we have a right to claim him. The
[2:28:12] sacrifice
[2:28:14] &gt;&gt; crossed over
[2:28:16] &gt;&gt; came down
[2:28:17] &gt;&gt; to where we are
[2:28:21] &gt;&gt; when we've
[2:28:24] been there.
[2:28:31] Right.

[2:28:47] God praise
[2:28:50] and when
[2:28:52] we
[2:28:57] were going to sing in a moment, praise
[2:28:58] God. Praise God. Because he's worthy of
[2:29:00] all the praise. I'm going to ask brother
[2:29:02] Andrew Withers to come and ask God's
[2:29:05] blessing upon the people. has been to my
[2:29:08] mind since yesterday. Brother Andy,

[2:30:27] [Music]
[2:30:29] Are you glad they're all washed away?
[2:30:33] God bless you, Brother Andrew.
[2:30:39] It's good to be here, saints. Thanks uh
[2:30:42] to all you mothers out there. Make a big
[2:30:44] difference to all of us. Just uh bow our
[2:30:46] heads.
[2:30:47] [Music]
[2:30:49] Dear Lord, we're just so thankful to be
[2:30:51] here today, Lord, in your presence. We
[2:30:54] just thank you for blessing us and come
[2:30:56] down and touching each one of us, Lord.
[2:30:58] Ask that you just bring a special
[2:30:59] portion of all the mothers here this
[2:31:02] morning. We thank them so much, Lord. We
[2:31:04] love them so much. We just ask that you
[2:31:08] would touch each one of them. We thank
[2:31:10] you, Lord, for your your lamb, Father,
[2:31:12] that you gave for all of our sins.
[2:31:16] They're gone, Lord. We know they're
[2:31:18] gone. We just thank you for reminding us
[2:31:19] this morning, for encouraging us for the
[2:31:22] rest of this week, the month to come,
[2:31:25] Lord, that Father, no matter what, Satan
[2:31:28] can't bring them back. Father, they're
[2:31:30] gone.
[2:31:31] &gt;&gt; They're gone.
[2:31:33] &gt;&gt; We just love you, Lord Jesus.
[2:31:35] &gt;&gt; Lord Jesus,
[2:31:36] &gt;&gt; we ask that you bless the service this
[2:31:39] evening.
[2:31:39] &gt;&gt; Yes, Lord.
[2:31:40] &gt;&gt; Thank you for the service that you
[2:31:42] brought this morning
[2:31:44] in your wonderful, precious name. the
[2:31:46] name of the Lord Jesus Christ. Amen.
[2:31:50] God bless you. Why
[2:31:52] &gt;&gt; don't you turn around, shake hands with
[2:31:53] some redeemed. If we cross over this
[2:31:56] afternoon, might be a few million years
[2:31:58] before you get to shake their hand
[2:31:59] again.
[2:32:02] God bless you. You're dismissed in Jesus
[2:32:04] name. Our brother Tom is speaking this
[2:32:06] evening. So come and God bless you,
[2:32:09] Sister Sally Daw. Take greetings and
[2:32:10] love to brother Edwin for us. Amen.
[2:32:14] Amen.
