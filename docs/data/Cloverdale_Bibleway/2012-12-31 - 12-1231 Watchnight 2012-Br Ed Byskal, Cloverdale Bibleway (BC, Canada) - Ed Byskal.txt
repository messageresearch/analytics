Our dear heavenly father, we're so grateful and thankful to you &gt;&gt; that we can gather tonight, Lord Jesus, &gt;&gt; looking back through the years with testimonies, Lord, within us with many things [music] to praise you about. We can look back at junctions where you have spoken to us, where you have picked us up, where you have opened doors for us, where you have fought battles for us, Lord Jesus. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Junctions where we knew that [music] something supernatural happened. And if it had not been Jesus, [music] where would we be today? We're here to thank you tonight, Lord. We're here to give our hearts to you, Lord. We're here to surrender all, Lord Jesus. You've given us clarity of vision to understand. That is not by our strength. [music] Many of us would have gone away, would have given up under great pressure. [music] &gt;&gt; But Lord, you never let us go. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Hallelujah. You're the one that is holding us and &gt;&gt; keeping us through, Lord. [music] &gt;&gt; Father, we want to thank you tonight, &gt;&gt; the living God among us &gt;&gt; that you desire so much to show yourself in your people. [music] And oh, how blessed we are that we are the ones that you have chosen, [music] &gt;&gt; part of your bride. &gt;&gt; But we can say so by faith. Lord, we thank you for a marvelous thing you are doing among us and we have the life to show and to testify that it is true. Your word being made so clear to us, Father. Lord, we pray that you will show forth yourself amongst us tonight. [music] Our worship, Lord, we bring it to you, Lord Jesus. Identify yourself amongst us, Lord Jesus. And all our believing friends, Lord, some on the internet, Lord Jesus, and [music] many on the hookups, Lord.

As we relax a little bit. Amen. Why don't we sing, I'm amazed that you love me. Amen. Amen. Why don't you have your seats? Our pastor is going to be coming in just a moment, but I thought we would sing a song [music] that's stuck with us throughout the year. His love has been so amazing. It amazes me that he could [music] love a sinner such as I. That we could be part of one family. [music] I'm [singing] that you love me. [music] I live out [singing] here. [music] Through your precious blood I have and my [music] sh [music] [music] is the end of tonight. [singing] [music] Oh, how [music] [singing] [music] to your precious love. I bow [music] for you. And I [music] want all my &gt;&gt; [music] &gt;&gt; And that's who we believe. That's what's really amazing. &gt;&gt; It's all done. Hallelujah. Well, welcome to this watch tonight service and uh we're in for a good time and we're in for a long time. Hallelujah. We're going to go right from one year to the next. Uh we have some greetings and we want to give them and get out of the way right away because we've got a lot of the different groups that are going to be singing. And uh as I said to someone in an email today, I said they're going to be singing. We're going to have a group in Chinese and another group in Russian and a group in Congalles and a group and after I named them all I said and some will sing in English also. Greetings from Germany from brother Gear Rodwald's church. Uh brother um brother Marcus Becker who ministers there and also was the interpreter when I was there. Uh and he's the one that put out a book quite a book with all the uh uh events throughout supernatural phenomena throughout brother Reynold's ministry. And uh so he he just sent us an email and wished us uh he said it was a pleasure and a great privilege to meet you and to work with you in 2012 and I trust to meet you again in 2013. Also greetings and uh these are special greetings. People have taken time to uh not only uh think about you but they wanted to write. They wanted it expressed. So the saints in Switzerland all and you've met many of them. So they want to be remembered to you. Brother Benny Perry from South Carolina called today. Pastor Benny Perry and he wanted uh the church to be greeted so that you also can uh we can say God bless you because many of them will be listening on the archives as well. Uh, brother Richard Dioa called the other day and he wanted to be remembered from the church in the Congo and some of you have been in that church and attended it. Uh, we have been there and what a wonderful congregation. Uh, a growing congregation. I don't know how many they have now. Probably 10,000 or more already. Now, uh, brother Vladisovv Vladislov Jacques, he's from Czech Republic and he gave his greetings the other day on Sunday. He gave greetings to the church in person, but uh he wanted to be remembered to you. And he has also uh emailed back right away and said, "We we streamed the meeting and heard the greetings and they were so happy that uh that they could be a part of the service." We had a lovely testimony and I don't have the pictures to show you tonight, but they sent also the pictures from brother [clears throat] Radu Lutus. uh in Romania and he's been working with the uh with a lot of the gypsy people and uh they had a whole line of them alongside of a pool and they were just going in to be baptized and I think I counted 12 or more uh of them ready to be baptized and he he felt directed to go to a certain town. So he just sent that to a number of the ministers here and wanted us to uh rejoice with them about that also from uh brother Yano and sister Anna Thomas and uh children from Serbia. He's a pastor in Serbia and he sent special greetings to us. and John 1:16. And of his fullness have have all we received and grace for grace. May the Lord Jesus bless you and your family and also the saints and keep you in this new year of 2013. And from Uganda, uh, Brother Basabosi, and they may be streaming right now, but we want to be sure and let them know that we have a good connection with them. and many of the saints here have a connection with him. He put out started in university with just a youth letter and it has grown till he's uh simply been is known almost all over the world right now. So and and a a group of our senior young people are going to be going over there I understand by God's grace and be a part of his wedding. He's going to get married. So we wish him the best. Amen. Uh, brother Diversson from from Malawi, he's now lives [clears throat] in London, Ontario, and he sent us special greetings as well. Uh, and I think that about does it. Brother Tom received some as well. But anyway, I just wanted to give you those greetings because I think we have an obligation to give those greetings when they've been sent specifically greet the saints for us. And so I don't take it like pray for us, you know, and they don't really mean it. We we mean it. We say pray for us, you pray for us. If they say greet greet the saints, well then I'm here greeting the saints. God bless you all. Can we say God bless you? &gt;&gt; God bless you. &gt;&gt; Amen. That's for everyone that'll be on the streaming. Amen. God bless you, brother. &gt;&gt; Amen. Why don't we have the uh senior choir and uh brother Ryan and sister Shana are going to sing together healer of my heart, young people's choir. I have to be quite specific this evening. So, if brother Ryan corrects me, it's totally fine tonight. Okay. All right. So, let's have the young people's choir. Perfect. And uh let's sing together as they're coming. Lord, I lift your name on high. Lord, I love to sing your praises. Amen. Lord, [music] I lift your name on high. Lord, I love to sing [music] your praises. [music] I'm so glad you're in my life. [music] I'm so glad you came to save us. You came [music and singing] from heaven to earth to show the way. From the earth to the cross. [music] My daddy. From the cross to the grave. From [music] the grave to the sky. Lord I lift your name on [music] high. See you the microphone. Matthew, God bless you this evening. Are we on? Wonderful. Uh, Brother Tom had mentioned at a watch night last year how he appreciated having songs that meant something throughout the year. And this was a song that the Lord gave me before camp that I've received probably about as many comments on as any song I've written. And um I've been blessed by it. So I just trust that uh we can all testify that he truly is the healer of our hearts. Not just our physical healer, but our spiritual healer. Amen. So maybe brother, could we have the word the chorus maybe on the screen and the small screen as well for the choir so that those who wish to join us can and we just trust it'll be a blessing to you. Amen. &gt;&gt; [music] [music] [music] [music] [music] &gt;&gt; You are the healer. [music] &gt;&gt; [music] &gt;&gt; Healer of my [singing] heart, the maker and the God [singing] of [music] all.

Is that what you're looking forward to? Amen. Brother Kyle, why don't you come this evening? Brother Kyle's going to speak to us for a couple of moments what the Lord has laid on his heart. Amen. God bless you this evening, Brother Kyle. &gt;&gt; God bless everybody. Amen. Didn't that sound good? &gt;&gt; Doesn't it look so dapper and fine? Oh my man, sons of God are royal. Amen. And so I'm so thankful to be here. Um I was just thinking as I was sitting there, you know, I think we're realizing more and more uh this is my eighth watch night and um I think we're realizing more and more how much of a miracle it is to serve God in the light of this hour. &gt;&gt; Amen. I don't know if you've been finding that lately, but um I sure have. And I just want to share a little thought if the brothers can put up my slides there. Would that be wonderful? So here we are. Got it, Aaron? Wonderful. So man, here we are at watch night and I've been thinking about, you know, 2012 has just gone, 2013 is coming and um whether 2012 was a good year or a bad year, it just depends on your perspective &gt;&gt; and whether you're excited for 2013 or not just depends on your perspective. &gt;&gt; Is that true? &gt;&gt; Amen. So let's just go for it a bit. So perspective, what is that? It's a particular attitude toward or way of regarding something or a point of view. So if in 2012 you spent a whole lot of time uh researching Mayan prophecies and the end of the world in 2012. Uh 2012 was probably a very embarrassing year for you. You probably wasted a lot of time and energy and uh you I don't know what you're thinking about 2013, but you should start reading your Bible. &gt;&gt; Amen. Cuz there's a three and a half year tribulation first. So, you should know these things. But if you're here, you're in a good spot. Amen. If you really like the NHL, you're probably really sad. So far, there's been no games and so forth, but uh it doesn't bother me at all. Amen. Let the season go. Let NFL go. Let NBA go. Amen. Word perspective. &gt;&gt; Amen. And uh if you're really into economics and the government and so forth, the fiscal cliff uh probably makes you a little bit worried and a little bit nervous and so forth. But if you have a Bible perspective, you know, things have to go that way. Amen. You know, the beasts and the powers have to bring things to a one world government and do all kinds of things with the economy. So, Amen. Don't worry about that. The Bible does not say, "He that enjoys himself to the end shall be saved." Right? He that endures to the end shall be saved. Um, you know, thinking of living a snowbird existence is so 2005, right? We don't we're not just trying to live our life to have big houses and live here in the summer and go somewhere warm in the winter and really enjoy oursel in life. We're here to be rugged, to be rugged Christians. So, we just need to have, as in German, they would say, a bibble perspective. Amen. Not a zeitgeist perspective, which means the the spirit of the world. Amen. Sister Gabusi, that's for you. A Bible perspective. &gt;&gt; Amen. I'm half German and half English like Blimin Dodd. So, here is a picture of Sister Marilyn Chabernovs. I took this without her permission. So, I was thinking of Sister Marilyn. This is uh 216th Street. I drive down it many times, but she has kind of an artist perspective, right? and she has kind of a a naturalist perspective. So if you see in this picture here, you notice up here there's some crows and down here there's some uh rotten corn. So she calls this the corn roast on 216th, right? So she's noticing these there's there's these subplots &gt;&gt; happening on this road, right? She she's noticing these things. She has an artist perspective to catch a different layer &gt;&gt; that other people aren't catching. And if you were a hydro uh power line guy like brother Sterling or brother uh Sam Ray, you might think, man, these these branches over here look look pretty close to those power lines. I mean, if it if it gets windy, I better call my boss and get these done cuz this is a real street, right? So, he would have like a hydro person's uh perspective and and way at looking at things. Do you understand what I mean? &gt;&gt; Amen. And so, we want to have a word of God perspective. &gt;&gt; And we don't want to be narrow-minded. Brother Ram says that in the times of Jesus, the Pharisees and Sadducees were so narrow. If you'd put a pencil in front of their eyes, it would blind them. That's that's how narrow they were. And that's how come they weren't able to recognize Jesus. And we don't want to be like that. Amen. We don't want to. I I find uh myself and other people in the message, I find we get so narrow-minded. We think that God is only speaking to us when the preacher mentions the same quotes we've been reading and the same scriptures we've been reading. And if that's not happening, we think God's not speaking to us. Right? That's very narrow. Amen. God wants to speak to us wherever we go. And he wants us to be open and to be willing for him to deal with our heart. And so, we need to have a a more uh wider word perspective. Amen. It's good for believers to uh read the Bible. Amen. Read the message and so forth. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. And so, I'm going to take a little bit of a a sharp corner here if you don't mind, but it's going to be purposeful. So, here is the little church that we rent in Victoria. Amen. Pretty nice, right? &gt;&gt; Amen. Who's been there so far? That's quite a lot, right? Praise the Lord. That's quite a lot of people. And so, uh that's at 500 Admiral's Road uh in Victoria there. Just wanted to show that. Then here is a picture of uh Brother Raphael. He sang up here with Brother Ansam. He's a song leader there. He just got married to Sister Alen right here in the summertime. You remember that? And there she is right there. There's his wife. Praise the Lord. They're smiling and so happy and doing good. Amen. And here's a picture of uh the group that's also with some friends and families when brother John Andy's was there. It's a big group, right? &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise the Lord. It's been over two years now the services have been going. &gt;&gt; That's a miracle. &gt;&gt; Amen. Every Sunday now at 2:00 there's service in Victoria. &gt;&gt; There's a lighthouse in Victoria. &gt;&gt; Amen. and I try and go once a month or one of these brothers come or brother Alex he's back there he'll take services on Sunday brother an S and souls are coming &gt;&gt; there's been five souls baptized in two years &gt;&gt; amen &gt;&gt; and and and three are doing really really good that's wonderful &gt;&gt; amen just think in two years does anybody know of another church in Canada that started in a fresh city not from a split does anybody know one &gt;&gt; nobody so what's your perspect perspective of what this is. &gt;&gt; It's a miracle. &gt;&gt; It's a miracle of God. &gt;&gt; In Acts 19, Paul passed through the upper coast of Ephesus. He found 12 people. &gt;&gt; Amen. Look at this. Amen. They're not all all of them there aren't serving in the fullness, but they're coming. &gt;&gt; They're coming regularly. &gt;&gt; Amen. There's about 15 uh solid message believers there. &gt;&gt; Amen. It's a miracle. &gt;&gt; Amen. Perspective. Praise God. And I love the believers there. I love them. &gt;&gt; I love them. They're humble and they witness. Every time I go there, there's someone new. Brother Guay, can you stand up? Amen. He's been coming for about six weeks. He's going to stay overnight at my house tonight. Amen. Let's give him a round of applause. [applause] Amen. So, if anybody is from Thailand or Burma. Amen. That's where he's from. You can talk to him a little bit. But Tom met him, remember? &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Isn't that wonderful? &gt;&gt; Amen. Perspective. So, here's the Tom Ray. I love it. I love it. But Tom Ray came. Amen. And uh if you look right here, you can't really see too good. There's Abigail and the kids. There's Joel. Here's Michael singing a special. Sister Joanne Ray on piano. It was the first time she ever had to play piano to how Oh God, how great thou Arth [clears throat] Ghana style. Amen. I love it. Amen. Everyone's different. I'm I'm rigid in German and English, but I love it. Amen. And so we had a good time. I was thinking about Tom and his family. Uh they could be a traveling evangelical family, you know. Mike could song lead, Sam could deacon, Joel could be the guy in the pew. Amen. The the girls could do the Sunday school. So just keep that in prayer. Amen. So that was December 16th. Uh so I I was thinking there sorry I was thinking about how um we without knowing it we kind of make God very historical without knowing it. We we do you know we kind of think of things like this. Oh wow. There's the journeys of St. Paul and you know St. Paul went here and St. Paul went there and St. Paul did this right? We we have these maps in our Bibles and we know these things and so forth. But what about this here? The the journeys of St. Thomas Aay. Amen. Was home. Amen. Right. Started in uh Cloverdale here and took the ferry and boat. Right. &gt;&gt; Just like what's what's the difference? &gt;&gt; Right. Was Paul a saint? &gt;&gt; Is Blam a saint? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; His middle name is Arthur. 107th Journey Blom. Amen. I don't know what it but that's just 10 seven is a good number. So, I was just thinking, you know, what's our perspective of things? What's our perspective of who we are? Right? The Bible says, "It's God who workketh in you to do of his good pleasure." Philippians 2:13. So, you know, when I'm saying things about Victoria, it's not cuz we're tooting horns. You know what I mean? It's God. &gt;&gt; It's God who workketh in you to do of his own good pleasure. Amen. So, don't write off those inner workings and churnings. They're for a purpose. It's God working in you. &gt;&gt; Amen. Maybe in a future date we'll get into that. And so I was thinking of this too. We don't think of that. And we also kind of think, you know, if I was in China, I've been there. You wake up in the morning and you think, you know, I better have breakfast cuz I I need strength to serve the Lord today. I'm going to do this and visit this person and visit that, right? But here we're like, you know, eat breakfast, go to work, go home. We don't have that same perspective. Well, what's the difference? What's the difference between China having breakfast, wake up up in the morning, have a bowling of Cheerios, and then going out to work here? It's all about perspective. &gt;&gt; It's all about perspective and seeing yourself, who you are, and what's your what's God's purpose for your life. &gt;&gt; Amen. And then you'll see God doing special things around you. And don't get me wrong, I'm for missions in China. I'm for missions in Iran. I'm for the young people going to Uganda. Don't get me wrong, okay? But it's perspective about our lives. We're not just churchgoers. Amen. Sons and daughters of God. &gt;&gt; Amen. What Ram says, this is one of the Mike Hunt's favorite quotes apparently. I had it down, but I took it out. God, he says in God's simplicity, God hides himself in a man who puts his lunch under his arm and goes to work. He said he can do he can do things through him. An archbishop knows nothing about Amen. A man with his lunchbox going to work. God hiding himself in simplicity. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. And so here's another saint here. This is the the journeys of St. Orin Hilderbranch. Amen. He walks about 100 ft every day back and forth. School, home, school, home, school, home. Right. You can't even get the directions on Google Map cuz it's too close. So, I had to do it myself. And I I worked with Orin this summer. He's a saint. Amen. And I was It doesn't sound very dynamic, but what it comes down to is Orin, all you people in school, &gt;&gt; what are you doing in school? Who are you influencing for the good? What are you resisting for the good? You're around over a hundred people every day. I'm around maybe five, right? You're around so many people, but it's a perspective of who you are and what you're doing. &gt;&gt; Amen. More than math, more than science, &gt;&gt; more than all of these kind of things. And I was thinking, another five minutes. Okay. &gt;&gt; Okay. I know there's some great things coming up tonight. So, Ivan might connect with us, but it's it's perspective, right? I was driving the other day um down 176th toward the highway. Okay, do you know where that is kind of 176th Street toward the highway? It's in the valley. Then you go up this hill towards the highway. Does everyone kind of know what I mean? So I was driving in the valley and it was raining. I went up the hill and it was snowing. I thought right there it's raining. Right here it's snowing, right? Just by coming up a little bit higher. If you can come up a little bit higher, your atmosphere is different. Amen. Just by coming up a little higher here, it's snow. Here it's not. And somebody could be right here and it could be snowing. He could have a cell phone talking to somebody right here. And this guy could say, "It's snowing." And he would say, "No, it's not." Right? But and they're so close and yet such a different thing is taking place around them. Right? Just by coming up a little bit higher. And if we can come up just a little bit higher in our perspective, we'll see God more. &gt;&gt; Amen. It's so simple. Bel says, "Get God in you. You'll see him everywhere." &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. And for me, uh, in my mind to come up higher, the greatest way to do it is Matthew 23:11-2. I've been sharing this verse a bit. But he that is greatest among you shall be your servant. Whoever and whosoever shall exalt himself shall be abased, and he that humble himself shall be exalted. Amen. If you can humble yourself, God can take you to a higher plateau. Amen. If you can take the low route, God can take you higher, but it takes being humble, it takes being willing to serve, Jesus saying is whoever bes your servant, so who's ever serving the body of Christ, right? And God will take you higher, but you got to be willing to serve God. Amen. And being humble, as brother Kim said, being humble isn't just your nature. You know, God bless you, brother. God bless you. Because some people could be like that. you know, God bless you, brother, but I'm not going to go to church. I can just stay home and listen to tapes. I'm not Right. So, they're not they're not being humble to the word of God. Just their nature is humble, &gt;&gt; right? You have someone like Brother Benoa. I love I love him. He doesn't come across as super duper humble, but he's so humble. He's married now and he's still serving God wherever he can. He put up those basketball hoops in the gym that we so enjoy. A newly married man. He doesn't have to do that. He's humble, serving the body of Christ. And God, give him a wife and give him a house. He's going to live just down the street in a house, right? He's humble. Amen. And God takes him higher. Amen. Just willing to serve, willing to do something for God. God will take you higher. Amen. I don't want to have what I call, and excuse me if this offends you, but I don't want to have bride pride, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; I'm the bride of Christ. I'm so good. Uh if what would people do without me? Everybody else is serpent seed. Right? You you can be embarrassed to go to restaurants with people. No respect to the waiter. No respect to the waitress. How is that salty? You're just holding a message book with long hair and long skirt. Right? You're not you're not carrying yourself the right way. And it's like this. Am I going too long? I'm I'm sorry. But um and you get people say you have the David, can you come here? I love Blood David. He's humble to me. He loves the word of God. Here's an example. Okay, let's say I say to David, you know, Blood David, I really don't like the police. The police do this and the police do that and the police, they're such bad people, right? Let's say I'm making fun of the police to him. Right? If all a sudden I see a guy in my backyard with a crowbar and a hood, I'm not going to call the David. I'm calling the police. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; Right. So, we need to be humble. Oh, thanks for the David. Appreciate you. Right. The Bible says, "Let every soul be subject unto the higher powers. For there is no power but of God. The powers that be are ordained of God. Whosoever therefore resisteth the power resisteth the ordinance of God." &gt;&gt; Right. The Bible, the Bible, Sister Gerta. Right. Amen. We need to Oh, the border guard this and the border guard that. They're protecting the country. They've been shot at recently, right? So what if you're a nice person? I if they only knew me and so forth. Yeah. Right. Every day they have people going through there who aren't nice and they're mean and so forth. Be humble. Amen. Be willing to be salty. &gt;&gt; Amen. Don't just have pride pride. Amen. Jesus, look at his example. People tore his beard out and he washed feet, right? I gave you an example to be humble and to serve. Amen. So that's part of my uh thing for the new year. Have the a humble perspective. Almost done. My little Bethlehem, let me tell you, brother, no matter who you are, you want to know how important you are? I said to my little girl, stick your finger in a bucket of water and pull it out and try to find the hole. We're nothing. There's only one important. That's God. We must remember he's the one. Amen. God's the important one. Amen. God's the one who let us come in this church building tonight. Amen. And God's the one who let us let us go out these doors. He is the important one. Amen. And we want to serve him with all of our heart. Amen. And so we're so thankful for, you know, things like Mount Baker Bible Way Camp, the message hub, our church missions, and the schools, but it's the grace of God. &gt;&gt; Amen. And these things don't make us better than any other bride member around the world. Amen. These are things that God gave us for some sort of purpose. Amen. Please forgive me if this offends you, but one person time two people were talking here and someone was saying, you know, we have the best church and we have the best ministry and like this and like this and their brother said the bride of Christ has the best ministry cuz it's the bridegroom ministering to the bride. Amen. All God has people all around the world. Amen. Let's be humble. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Right? Be humble. &gt;&gt; Amen. We're a more visible church, but be humble. &gt;&gt; There's people out there who are serving God with all their heart. Brother Boz and Bozie, people you'll never hear about just as important to the body of Christ as you are or as I am. Amen. Be humble. Bill Graham says, "And humble thyself." Show me a church that's humble. I'll show you a church that has the power and favor of God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Humble. &gt;&gt; Amen. So, I'm I'm done here in about 10 seconds. So, 2013, whatever people are thinking this will happen, that will happen. farmers, almanac, and all this kind of stuff. Just have a Bible perspective. Say, God, just keep me in the middle of the road and man, let let the trash of fanaticism go this way and let the trash of just rigid Baptist go that way and just help me stay on the middle of the road and be humble and serve you, Jesus, and have a a right perspective. Amen. God bless you. I hope that something made sense. really appreciate uh eight years here. [applause] Thank you, brother Cal. Amen. Lord, I lift your name. Maybe you want to stand for a moment. [music] Lord, I lift your name. &gt;&gt; [music] &gt;&gt; your holy name. [music] beyond. [music] [music] [music] [music] &gt;&gt; [music] &gt;&gt; All I am [music] Glory.

So uh just may the Lord God one same yesterday, today and forever be with all of you and remember you and your sacrifice for the eternal home which is in heaven. So now we are fellow soldiers running the race of eternal vest. So as you know um you want to give a I want to give a a five minutes report what happened. Okay. &gt;&gt; Speak slowly. &gt;&gt; Fast &gt;&gt; slow. &gt;&gt; Okay. Um as you know um the Lord is that established the printing office in China through a group of humble believers here you can see on the back you can see they're working it's a working day busy day it's also our new year time in year 2012 we printed 94,000 books &gt;&gt; 94,000 Exactly. And we just received an order for the new year, the first month of new year. It's u 8,300 books, including 420 Korean messages and 100 Japanese message. So um from the start of the printing station to now we send sended 127,000 books up. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; You can hear the number. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Well, the spoken word is the original seed. All the original seeds are now satisfying and changing many hungry souls here in China. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. And now we are not only formatting the message for the PC users but also format it into tabs epo for the great number of smartphones and tablet users them to to be able to reach end time message. Amen. God sometimes spreading his gospel by many avenues many times high above our thoughts right &gt;&gt; for example last month two brothers came uh I went to McDonald's so I I know you know these two brothers pretty well and we talked to to them later on and u when we finished praying amen and a young lady just come approached and talk to us. She was just talking to her friends saying she wants to become a Christian and ready to be baptized trying to be baptized. When when she was talking to her friend, she heard amen from us. first team fellowshipped with us and uh so we spend a few uh time few hours and just fellowship with her and send her a few books. Last Sunday she was baptized in the name of Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Just two days ago. Well, what should I say then? God who makes Peter fishes of men for added to his his house. He's still ordering the steps of good man. So let us spread the word of God with boldness. &gt;&gt; Right? &gt;&gt; Uh I think brother Abraham said uh the gospel will go back to the oldest civil civilization China. But I think this world this word will not it is actually manifesting in front of your eyes. &gt;&gt; God bless you brother. &gt;&gt; Yes. That's you &gt;&gt; brother. We want to give you our love and greetings from Cloverdale. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; And we want to welcome you home soon. &gt;&gt; I'd love to. &gt;&gt; When are you? So that we know that you can give us a date. When are you coming home? &gt;&gt; I think around Chinese New Year. After Chinese, maybe a little bit after Chinese New Year. Well, we want to tell you, Brother Ivan, &gt;&gt; we want to tell you that we've held you in prayer. &gt;&gt; You and Sister ANA, &gt;&gt; you are in our constant thoughts. &gt;&gt; You are not alone. &gt;&gt; We have a church that loves you &gt;&gt; and we expect to see you back.

And greet the people and the saints from the living saints in Cloverdale. &gt;&gt; God bless you. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; God bless you all. &gt;&gt; God bless you.

And now maybe the Russian uh singer, the brothers and sisters that will be singing in Russian, why don't you come and make your way while I make a couple announcements here. We're looking forward to that. Come on down. Brother Ivan, I don't know if it was clear enough to you. Uh I was seeing it. You weren't seeing the picture, but Brother Ivan and his sister Aanath were standing right in front of their little camera. And behind them was a pile or shouldn't pile just a group of people that were making books. And they are working right now printing more the message to get out to China. &gt;&gt; And they had done over 127,000 books this year by hand. I say, "Praise the Lord." &gt;&gt; [applause] &gt;&gt; That's amazing. That is amazing to have in a little room a group of people come on down and have them staple, print, and put them together and have them ready to go out all through China. I think that is amazing. &gt;&gt; And you know, the footsteps of the righteous are ordered of the Lord. In everything that we do, God has an order. and that and we need to remember that and thank God for it. But brother Toby and my son Michael went to China just a few weeks ago. And what brother Ivan was saying is here's a a a cup here's brother Toby and my son in China. And Michael only will eat chicken. So he says, so they go to the rest this particular restaurant and they said, "Do you have chicken?" They said, "We're out of chicken." Michael says, "No way. We're I'm not eating here." So they went to a McDonald's and right across the street was a McDonald's. This is what brother Ivan was saying, that sister that was baptized. They were in McDonald's with brother Ivan, Toby, and Michael. And they bowed their heads and prayed over their food. And there was a lady sitting at another table watching them. And she was just saying to another lady, "I would like to ask a Christian some questions." And there God brought them right there at that little restaurant. Brother Ivan has just baptized her for the glory of God. Amen. [applause] Amen. [music] [music] Yes. Foreign speech. Foreign speech. Foreign speech.

If you get a chance when they're in town, don't rob yourself. Have them over. They really enjoy it. God bless you. There we don't uh we don't charge rent for our our bedrooms for our guests. So, I'm sure enjoyed our time with you, brother Derek. [music] [music] &gt;&gt; [music] &gt;&gt; It's not hard to believe. Standing on the [singing] mountain tops of glory. [music] When you can hear the song of angels [music] and the breeze from heaven sends your spirit soaring. [music] But in [music] the valley once more, will Jesus still be Lord? That's the question. For believing when believing isn't easy, [music] that is the testing. Oh, I [music] need faith for the time when the sun does not [singing] shine and the [music] mountaintop is just a memory. When [music] there's no signs [singing] to be seen and I don't feel a thing to the [music] word of God alone, I must cling and I need faith for the day [singing] when [music] trouble comes my way and I just don't understand [singing] what it [music] means. That's when nothing else will do. [music] Faith alone will get me through. And [music] believing becomes my victory. [music] It's not hard to believe [music] when things are going well and skies are sunny. &gt;&gt; [music] &gt;&gt; When you feel you're making progress, doing good, living [music] in a time of plenty. Oh, [music] but if all of that should change, would you still keep [music] the faith? That's the question. &gt;&gt; [music] &gt;&gt; for believing when believing isn't [music] easy. That is the testing. Oh, I need faith [music] for the time when the sun [singing] does not shine and the mountain [music] top is just a memory. when there's [music] no signs [singing] to be seen and I don't feel a thing [music] for to the word of God alone. I must cling. And I need [music] faith for the day when trouble comes my way. [music] And I just don't understand what it means. Oh, that's [music and singing] when nothing else will do. Faith alone will get me through. [music] and believing becomes my victory. Oh, [music and singing] I need faith for the time when the sun [music] does not shine and the mountain top is just a memory. [music] When there's no signs to be seen [music] and I don't feel a thing to the word of God alone, I must cling and I [singing] need [music] faith for the day. When trouble comes my way and I [music] just don't understand what it means. Oh, that's [music] when nothing else will do. Faith alone will get me [music] through. Yes, that's when nothing else will do. Faith alone will get me through. [music] And believing becomes my victory. [music] I pray for the time when the sun [music] does not shine and the mountain dog [singing] is just another [music] sign to be seen [music] and I don't feel the word of [music] God alone [singing] I must I [music] faith for the day when trouble comes my way [music] and I just don't understand what it means. [music] That's when nothing else will do. May the Lord will get me through [music] and believing becomes my victory. [music] &gt;&gt; [music] [applause] &gt;&gt; Amen. You believe that? &gt;&gt; You may have your seats. I'm not going to sing with you. That's the singer in the family. Amen. Well, it's been quite a year. &gt;&gt; It's been quite a year. Anybody had a trial this year? Anybody had a trial this year? &gt;&gt; Amen. Yeah. Me, too. &gt;&gt; It's been a good year. Amen. Anybody feel like they weren't going to make it through the trial? &gt;&gt; Yeah. Me, too. I felt like that at odd time, &gt;&gt; but we made it. &gt;&gt; Anybody glad to be here tonight? &gt;&gt; Yeah, me too. &gt;&gt; It's good to be here tonight. We made it. &gt;&gt; 2012. It's been quite a year. Every trial is is relative. Everybody has their own trial and everybody goes through what God sees that uh we have need of and what he and his sovereignty chooses to mold us in our character knowing that we all must be molded because character is not a gift. It's a victory. And that's what we appreciate about the revealed word of the hour is just knowing those simple little truths that carry us through. You can put that picture up if you would on the screen. And uh greetings from brother Murphy, perspective. Where's Brother Kyle? Perspective. I always knew I liked his sense of humor. I didn't realize till tonight he was half German and half English there. There was always something special about him. And uh brother Murphy sends his greetings tonight and he's in Grand Prairie as you can see by the picture here. He says, "I took this picture yesterday from the church." And he says, "All my impression about Grand Prairie is snow, snow, snow, and cold, cold, cold, but actually I like it." &gt;&gt; How come we were so quiet on that one? He says, "It's not as gloomy and raining miserable as at home. At least they got lots of sunshine here." He said, "We had two meetings yesterday. I trust the Lord had put something in the people's hearts that will help them down the road through the preaching of the word. He says they're a wonderful congregation. Brother Darren and the saints here asked me to pass the greetings and love to brother Ed yourself, all the ministers and all the saints in Cloverdale. So God bless you from brother Murphy tonight who is in Grand Prairie having his own trial. Actually, he's having a good time and uh we sure appreciate him going up there. The Saints, I got a letter, a note from Brother Darren. He said, "I I uh have lost count of all the wonderful blessings we have received this week through Brother Murphy. The saints have really appreciated it. And so, Sister Tracy, God bless you for sparing your husband. Uh put the extra blanket on the bed when he gets home and he'll want to warm up, I'm sure. Give him a sweater and whatever else he has in need of. Praise the Lord. Well, we've come to this time of year that we call uh turning the page of a calendar. And uh you know, time is just a figure of speech. It's just a word. And uh really as what you what we look back this year at is a uh a series of interconnected events that have brought us to the place that we now stand. The events of your life might be a little bit different than the events of my life, but God saw fit that we would go through those events. And and uh in the scripture when God refers to events, God refers to rather a space of time or a period of time. Most often, God does not refer to a a calendar, but he refers to a sequence of events that have brought a person to the place where they are now at. Because our life, we realize, has a destiny. Predestination, excuse [clears throat] me, predestination speaks to that. Speaks that there is a destiny. God speaking in Joshua chapter 24. He says, he says to Israel, "Thus saith the Lord God of Israel, your fathers dwelt on the other side of the flood in old time is speaking the flood is speaking of the Jordan River. The other side of the flood in old time, even Terra, the father of Abraham and the father of Nor and they served other gods. And I took your father Abraham from the other side of the flood, and led him throughout all the land of Canaan, and multiplied his seed, and gave him Isaac. And I gave unto Isaac Jacob and Esau, and I gave unto Esau mount Seir to possess it. But Jacob and his children went down into Egypt. And God goes on and he says, "And I sent Moses and Aaron, and I plagued Egypt." And as he lists these things in Joshua 24, as Joshua has come to the end of his life and his ministry, he's looking back over the things that have happened since the time that God called Abraham and Isaac and Jacob and the events of his life. And brother Brandham so took us through many things that that were key points that are brought out in the scripture for a purpose that were reflecting something that was to come. In one place he takes it he takes the scripture of Abraham uh taking Isaac on up on the mountain to sacrifice him at the uh at the command of God. And uh as he takes him up there on the mountain in Genesis 22, the angel of the Lord calls out and says,"Abraham, stay your hand." and and he calls to him the second time and he says, "By myself have I sworn, sayaeth the Lord, for because thou has done this thing and has not withheld thy son, thine only son, that in blessing I will bless you, and multiplying I will multiply thy seed as the stars of the heaven, and as the sand which is upon the seashore, and thy seed shall possess the gate of his enemies. Brother Brown takes that scripture and many times preaches on that and he and he calls it possessing the gates of your enemy, possessing the gates of the enemy and many times uses that title. But then in 1964, which I believe is the last time he preaches it, he calls it possessing the gates of the enemy after a trial. &gt;&gt; So it took the trial for Abraham to come to that place in his life. It took an event. It took God leading him. It wasn't a calendar. It wasn't that we can say, "Well, we made it through 2012, so we've arrived somewhere." If you haven't been through something this year, you haven't arrived. &gt;&gt; Oh, that was awful quiet. &gt;&gt; That's the way life is. It's not about we turn the calendar page. We didn't come here tonight to turn a calendar page. We come here tonight to say we've had some victories. &gt;&gt; Amen. We come here to say tonight, God's been with us. &gt;&gt; And if God before us, who can be against us? &gt;&gt; And we're rejoicing at the things that God has done for us this year. &gt;&gt; We're not rejoicing. We're not survivors. &gt;&gt; I I went to a funeral one time. It was a I shouldn't say it was I went to a funeral. It was my mother's funeral now that I think about it. And I was talking to a fellow who had lost his wife uh through uh um I believe it was cancer. And he said to me, he says,"Tim," it was a cousin of mine, and uh he said, "Tim, I want you to know I'm a survivor." He says, "I I know what you're going through. I'm a survivor." I says, "I appreciate the thought." I said, "But I'm not a survivor. I'm an overcomer. &gt;&gt; There's a difference. &gt;&gt; I didn't survive 2012. I overcame 2012." &gt;&gt; Are you with me tonight? &gt;&gt; You didn't survive 2012. You overcame 2012. Hallelujah. No what? No matter what the devil threw in front of you, you overcame it. &gt;&gt; And you're here tonight as an overcomer. &gt;&gt; Amen, brother Sam. We're overcomers. &gt;&gt; Amen. We are more than conquerors. &gt;&gt; Yes, we are. Right. &gt;&gt; So after God recounts in [snorts] Joshua 24, as I was referring, he says, "I've done this and I've I've led Abraham and Isaac and Jacob and and done all these things for you. And I sent Moses and Aaron, and I sent the plagues, and I brought you out with a mighty hand, and I brought you through the Red Sea, and I brought you through the flooding Jordan, and I brought you through all these things." And Joshua commands him and says, 'Now therefore fear the Lord and serve him in sincerity and in truth. Put away the gods which your fathers served on the other side of the flood and in Egypt, and serve ye the Lord. And if it seem evil unto you to serve the Lord, choose you this day whom you will serve. &gt;&gt; Amen. whether the gods which your father served that were on the other side of the flood or the gods of the Amorites in whose land you dwell. But as for me and my house, &gt;&gt; we will serve the Lord. &gt;&gt; I'm going to read that again. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; As for me and my house, we will serve the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. From about Joshua 18 to to this place in Joshua 24, Joshua is uh arriving at the end of his ministry. It's an end of an era. It's the end of his life. Time, as I said, is just a word, but it has gone on. They had been in the land for seven years, possessing the land. 47 years they were into the Exodus, 40 years in the wilderness, 7 years in the promised land. But there still remained much work to be done. And as Joshua recounts in Joshua 18 at the kind of the beginning of this whole segment of scripture, Joshua says, it says rather that there remained among the children of Israel seven tribes which had not received their inheritance. After 40 years in the wilderness and seven years in the promised land, 47 years, there remained seven tribes which had not received their inheritance. And Joshua said to the children of Israel, "How long are you slack to go and possess the land which the Lord God of your fathers has given you?" has given you. How long are you slack? Slack means disheartened. How long are you disheartened? It's a question in the time of the Exodus. In other words, he's saying it's not a time to slack the rains. As we've arrived at this time, I chose this scripture because we're 47 years past 1965 when the when the message was complete. The mystery of God was finished. The prophet was taken off the scene. And now we've been 47 years down the road. Here Joshua at the end of his ministry was 47 years down the road and said, "There's still much to do. &gt;&gt; It's not a time to get slack. &gt;&gt; It's not a time to just relax and say, "Oh, well, you know, we we've arrived." He says there some of you have not possessed your land yet. Matter of fact, the majority of the tribes had not possessed their land yet. &gt;&gt; And and it actually describes the land and says says that the the land was subdued before them or literally would say we would say the land was under their feet. As we know that footsteps is possession. And so anywhere that their foot would trod, God had given them that land. And Joshua commanded them. And the scripture describes it and said the whole land was subdued. But yet they hadn't gone out and possessed it all. And I could say this evening that the word of God is in full effect. &gt;&gt; That the bride of Jesus Christ has come to the fullness of the work. It's right in our hands, in our midst, in our mouth, in our hearts, in our lives, in our people. &gt;&gt; And are we possessing it the way that we ought to possess it? Don't slack. I'm convinced there's much more to do. I'm convinced there's there's much that lays ahead of us. And I when I say much, I don't necessarily mean we have much time, but we have much to do. And uh I think that we recognize this year that uh we are we could say as a body of Christ we're losing our Joshua and Calebs. I hope that's not too hard to say. We saw brother Lonnie Jenkins go home just a short time ago. Uh some of the old soldiers are beginning to leave us here. But Joshua's commission as he left was don't be disheartened. &gt;&gt; Don't be downcast. &gt;&gt; Don't be slack. And he commanded them to go and to find the land and go and search it out. And uh that if I could say this and I'm just trying to conserve time here, but if I could just say the word of God has been revealed, but the word revealed, that is to say, the title deed that Adam lost is our inheritance. &gt;&gt; And it's been defined. It's been described. And if there was anything that Israel lacked, it was the it was the energy to go and take that and make that a definition in their life and say this is our land. They did not lack going over Jordan. They did not lack for the new birth. It was the ones that had went over Jordan that want needed to go in and possess all the land. We appreciate the new birth. &gt;&gt; We must have the new birth. without crossing Jordan, you'll never possess the land. But when you're born again, don't stop there. &gt;&gt; That's not the end. That's the beginning. &gt;&gt; That's not that's not the the full journey. That's the beginning of the journey. &gt;&gt; That's entering into the land. And that's beginning to possess all of it. In the full possessing thereof, there is a rapture. &gt;&gt; In the full possessing of it, there is a rapture. Amen. &gt;&gt; In this word lays a rapture. &gt;&gt; In the revealing of those seals lays rapturing faith. &gt;&gt; Laying in there is your inheritance. &gt;&gt; Laying in there is your body change. And so I would say as Joshua told the children of Israel, not being a Joshua, but just as Joshua would say it, we need to just go and possess it. &gt;&gt; It's laying there for us. We need to lay hold of all of as we look forward to the new year. We appreciate what we've overcome last year. We appreciate the victories that God has given us. But life has a purpose and the purpose, and I'm going to steal your thunder, Steve. The purpose is not the training. I had him share a message he preached in Grand Prairie as we were out at Mount Baker at the campground. And he said something that inspired me, and we were sitting around fellowshipping. I said, "Now share that with everybody." And these young preachers, they don't like to always be the center of attention. But he was sharing some things and that was very profound in that your life has a purpose. And the purpose isn't the training. &gt;&gt; The purpose is the character. &gt;&gt; The purpose is the nature of Christ. The trials that we go through are only training towards a purpose that God has for us in this world. Amen. &gt;&gt; We sometimes get a little bit worried about the cares of life and all of the pressures of life and all of those things. That's not the purpose. The purpose isn't the job. The purpose isn't the hardships. The purpose isn't the little things we go through. Those are only necessary ingredients for the building of the Christlike character within the believer to possess all the inheritance. &gt;&gt; Because power without character is demonic, but power with character is fit to rule. Amen. &gt;&gt; So what is the purpose &gt;&gt; as we look forward? &gt;&gt; Praise God. &gt;&gt; There is a future. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Sometimes it might not have looked like it, but there is a future. &gt;&gt; What's the purpose? To live Christ. &gt;&gt; To display him. Sometimes we we we get focused on one act aspect of the purpose. As I close, one aspect might be, well, my purpose is to if I could just win somebody to Jesus Christ. That's a part of the purpose, you know, where we're we're we talk about it, you know, in missions as we're focused on missions and the things that we've done, whether it be, you know, the Chinese Bible or the the reader project, the the hub engine uh search project, search engine project, the family alter books, which are in uh uh regular format or digital format, the the faith challenge reports, hitting a million and downloads on the hub. Uh whether it be adding new languages like we have seen the the the Arabic, the Korean, the Erdo languages, some major languages in the world that are necessary to get the message into the hands of the people. The meetings uh been a lot of meetings since I've been here going, Brother Biscll's been traveling a lot. went with him to North Carolina. Then he was in Murphy'sboro while I was in Holland. And then he went over to Dallas and and different meetings and new meetings coming up in the new year and missionary meetings and and conventions and things that we'll be traveling and ministering and and we we have all of these things that we're doing and these we we might call them projects or we might call them uh necessary things that we have to do. I think brother Tom's going to China. I just dropped that in there just so uh we I always emphasize brother Tom's going to China and all of these things we get focused on. But now I just want to I just want to focus it right down and say the real purpose the real purpose is to live Christ to display him to be him &gt;&gt; in every moment in every situation. When the word was made flesh 2,000 years ago, Jesus did not take a holiday from being Christ. word made flesh in that day. &gt;&gt; And the bride is the word made flesh in this day. &gt;&gt; In whatever the situation is, whether you're on an airline sitting beside somebody and you share with them the gospel, whether you're in a supermarket sharing it with somebody there, whether you're on the job, whether you're in the school as we heard tonight, whatever it might be, the purpose is to be him. That's the entire purpose. It's not what would Jesus do, that's an old saying, but rather what is the word in me moving me to do &gt;&gt; this year. God bless you. &gt;&gt; In Jesus name. Amen. Let's sing together. In Jesus [music] name, we press on. We're going to have Sister Margaret Florence in the group come. And just after they've sung, Brother Leon, the Filipino [music] group, if you'd come and get ready just after Sister Margaret sang. &gt;&gt; [music] &gt;&gt; In [singing] Jesus name we press [music] on.

[music] We're getting stronger every day [music] through the blood [singing] of Jesus Christ. [music and singing] [applause] &gt;&gt; [music] &gt;&gt; I [singing] found me. &gt;&gt; [music] &gt;&gt; might allow me. [music] Oh my [music] Let [music] all [music] the glory I glory to my glory. [music] &gt;&gt; [music] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; I don't know if you've noticed, but I'm going to speak the obvious. Next New Year, we're going to have a group from Cloverdale that's going to come up and sing. And maybe we'll just call it from Canada just in case. just praise God. &gt;&gt; Uh I just give back the glory and thanks for the Lord that that's what he gave to our life. I don't know to to be uh you know emotional but it's good to be emotional in the Lord right not bad at all. Yeah. And thank you Lord God because brother Tom said that I will say something uh I must blow my horn. Yeah my friend's horn because I was a band members before too you know my you know and I was a member of the band members then my instruments a friend's horn and sometimes it's a bus. So if my conductor give me the sign to blow my horn, I must blow it. And the the one that are in the fronts that are always soloist, they they are waiting to blow my horn. So I must blow that one. So sometimes the masterpiece that we are playing is so port changing the beat sometimes it is go to change the bit into one half sometimes in three part and sometimes it become pass that's why we I must see to it I must see to it that my conductor I'm looking with the conductor and the word &gt;&gt; the note And I don't know when I was in the Philippines I was so I don't I don't expect that we are in your front. I am in your front but I believe that God bring me here &gt;&gt; and I we we I play the great masterpiece of God since I hear the message. I saw it so and I love it and he changed me. &gt;&gt; He changed me not only in my heart in my heart deep in my heart and I want him more more more &gt;&gt; and please Lord change me more and mold me more not only me and all the Filipino and all our brother and sister here. And and now I can see that we have a great masterpiece that we are playing in. If our great conductor will point us, give the signal to blow our horn, we must blow our horn. &gt;&gt; Especially when we are alone in the work or we are in the market or we are in McDonald, we must not be shy praying our food. That's the character of the Christian. &gt;&gt; And thank you Lord God in this church. &gt;&gt; I see the hands of God here. &gt;&gt; It changed me a lot. I was a backslider but still I stand up because he's with me &gt;&gt; by his grace. I do all his work. I do his word and I'm always praying that Lord God teach me more. Lord God, give me more your blessing and teach me more. Teach me more to wait third until your coming until the final and we call it the the final or the final say signs of the conductor will go like that and all will be stopped. &gt;&gt; Yes. Thank you for the Lord and we are singing. Hope you will be blessed in our &gt;&gt; our our peace Lord God. I know I am the [music] bride that you're returning for.

I will worship you. I [music] will bow myself down [singing] at your throne. I [music] will do anything. I will give everything to [music] you Lord. [singing] [music] [applause] Amen. &gt;&gt; Enjoying it. &gt;&gt; The last two lines of the song that the Filipino group were singing uh just fits in with exactly the few comments that I have. I'm going to be very brief, but I want to tell about two men that Jesus spoke about in just a few moments. But the two lines that they were in the chorus that the group were just singing, I will do anything and I will give everything. Uh that that happened to be a very very powerful statement. And uh I happen to have some quotes that were right in line with uh what they just sang and I want to leave them with you. Uh we're soon departing what we know as uh 2013 20 uh 2012 and going into 2013. And uh uh I was just thinking uh before coming to the service this evening, none of us really know what 2013 holds. Uh we always say well the next year holds we don't know what it holds. Uh and I think what the best uh counsel that I could give in the fewest words possible would be that we need to make preparation. We should be mentally prepared for whatever it holds that it's not going to move me. &gt;&gt; I'm not going to be shaken by it. And that calls for preparation. Now, we can do that even tonight. Say whatever it holds. I'm sold out to God. &gt;&gt; I just want to be sold out to his will. &gt;&gt; I will do anything and I will give everything just to be able to walk this road. And we've we've rejoiced tonight. Uh but we want to do just a little bit of serious thinking for just a few minutes. one the Jesus told the story of two men and they both uh built a house and both of them experienced winds and storms and a severe shaking &gt;&gt; and one of them stood and remained standing and one of them collapsed. Now those two men were probably men that Jesus knew or spoke of. I don't think it was just a parable and the only difference was they both heard the same words and one did them and one did not. And so Jesus describing the situation of the two men's lives probably both fine men probably had neighbors. Uh they were probably people that could sit in a service like this. They could clap their hands and enjoy the singing and enjoy the words and nod their head and perhaps say amen. Uh but one of them walked out and didn't do it &gt;&gt; and the other one actually did it. &gt;&gt; And the difference between the two is the one that did it, we might say, well, what is it that means to do the word or to do what we hear? I've been pondering a great deal upon what are the commandments of the Lord? What are the statutes? What are his precepts? What is his counsel? And I can tell you that anything that we have out here in the world. And when we leave this place and we're out on the out of education or places our places of our work or places of our endeavor, this world is not conducive to the word of God. This world is not conducive to living a godly spiritual life. And one thing that is an earmark of a spiritual life is it's a giving life. &gt;&gt; I will do anything and I will give everything. And and and you might say, well, soon as we talk about giving, we think about money. I'm not talking about money. I'm talking about your life. You got youth, you should use it. You got strength, health that come from God. There's a lot of people don't have health tonight. And I think about myself. I was just thinking in the last few days, uh, we have no guarantee. There's people, uh, there's people that are a whole lot younger than myself and younger than you sitting here that are stricken down. There's children in the children's hospital just hanging on by by a a thread of life, just children. And you go to the sick hospital and here at Christmas time and so on, people are visiting, the firemen visit and so on. And I look at that and I see that in the paper and so on. I I just think it's such a travesty and such a tragedy that the that we have that in the country, but yet we can't if if like brother Brandon said, if I were God, I would I would heal you. But that is something. And then people think that God's allowing this. Listen, friends, it's the world that it's the world that man has devised. Man has put this world together. &gt;&gt; It's man that has taken and and taken all the things and and has perverted it and and listen to things that we so enjoy. Some of them are very damnable things. They can corrupt a person. You can listen to music and it can be so corrupting. Thank God we're listening to good music tonight. Thank God we're listening to words that are true. Thank God we hear somebody stand up and read out of the scripture. And you can read about these two men in Matthew the 7th chapter. And the Bible says that one was wise and one was foolish. &gt;&gt; And the only difference between the two, the wise man dug deep. And that's I want to leave you with that tonight. I think in preparation for 2013, in preparation for the rest of your life, what you want to do is dig deep. &gt;&gt; You want to hear what you're hearing tonight and dig deep and build your life on a solid foundation and something that cannot shake. And the one thing that cannot shake is this word of God. It will never shake. And when God makes it real to you, uh, it will be a reality. I mean, it will be so real. I want to give you two or three quotes before I close because I would like you to prepare this next year to give yourself. &gt;&gt; Give what you have. In fact is I may want to shock you a wee bit tonight. We haven't even started. &gt;&gt; We haven't even started there. There's very few people that actually give themselves unreservedly. &gt;&gt; When I was a teenager like some of you young fellas here, God gave me a car. I was hauling kids to church every Sunday. &gt;&gt; Don't be quiet now &gt;&gt; because you see me, you know, my white hair and say, "Oh, yeah. I was fine for you. Uh, I was a teenager one day and I had a car and I got married young and we had little children and we had people in our house all the time. We had people over there all the time. You say, "Well, what do I do?" Well, start inviting somebody. There's people here probably tonight from Seattle or Tacoma, someplace. Maybe they haven't even got a place to stay. You say, "Well, if I got all prepared and maybe, you know, sometime in the future." They're not talking about the future, talking about tonight. Just give yourself. &gt;&gt; Give yourself to the gospel of Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; Give your strength. One day you might not have it. &gt;&gt; Give your youth. One day you won't have it. &gt;&gt; Because time is going to go on. 213 and 2014 and 2015. There'll be a time you won't have it. Say, "Oh my, if I only could do it." Don't wait till the future. Just do it now. &gt;&gt; You weren't expecting that, were you? Brother Brandham says this, and I'm going to give you three or four quotes and then close. What a perfect picture today when you begin to feel like you're slacking or the devil says it's no use. Has he ever said that to you? It's no use. Reach down, tighten up the belt a little bit, pull up the sword a little tighter in the hand and go forward. He said, I like that. Be ready for the march. &gt;&gt; I want to say to this congregation, whatever 2013 holds, tighten up the buckle. take a firmer grip upon the sword &gt;&gt; and go forward. &gt;&gt; I know what I'm talking about. &gt;&gt; The devil hates to hear that, but I'm saying to you in the name of the Lord, do that. And he says in another place, "And the angel of God which went before the camp of Israel," he's still here. &gt;&gt; He's here this evening in his watch night service. And the angel of God that went before the camp of Israel, that same angel of God that went before the camp of Israel is here. &gt;&gt; That's according to a prophet's word. &gt;&gt; You believe that? &gt;&gt; I believe that with all my heart. He's He's present. The same angel is here. We just need to recognize him. And he says, "And and they removed from the front and went behind them. And the pillar of cloud went from before before their face and stood behind them. And I want to say to you this evening, whatever 2013 holds, God who knows what you're going to face, he's the one that can go from in front and behind and surround you. And he'll be in front of you and be behind you as well. Be encouraging you on, be giving you wisdom, be thrusting you forward, take a hold of the sword. &gt;&gt; Amen. And so I decided even myself before I got up here to say these few comments, I decided I want to turn my life. I want to just find more. I want to squeeze more time out of the world. I want to squeeze more time out of my day and just ponder the word of God and ponder the message that the prophet of God that God used the prophet to send us and set ourselves in a direction for our lives. I I I think that that would be real wise. So he said, "And show us the father." So we are not here for that purpose. We are here to try to help you. And here's my theme in these last three four quotes. I'd like everybody to make this their resolution. if you make resolutions. He said, "We are here to try to help you, to try to do something to make the neighborhood here a little bit easier to do right and a little harder to do wrong. &gt;&gt; Make life a little more pleasant to you. And maybe that God will heal your sickness and lengthen your days and save the lost and help the churches. We're just here to help somebody." So many times he said that. He said, "But here's one consolation I have." He said, "When I find a few minutes to sleep, when I have my prayer before going to bed, I know this, that by God's grace, I've done the best that I could to make life a little better for my fellow man." He said another time he said, "It's to this end that I'm here to try to do that. To join hands with your doctor, to join hands with your chiropractor, with your surgeon, with your pastor, with your neighbor, and all try to make life just a little bit better." You know, there's a lot of people that Brother Brandham ministered to and did and made their life a little better that aren't going to heaven. &gt;&gt; There's a lot of people that he he tried to help that brand of people that maybe just will go through tribulation. He he [clears throat] didn't make any lines about that. He's just trying to make life better. &gt;&gt; Do you agree with that? &gt;&gt; Make life easier. I think that children, whether they get born again or don't get born again, they're better to go to Sunday school. They're better to go to a Christian school if they can. They're better to go and and and hear the gospel of Jesus Christ. You that are sitting here in this watch night service. I'm saying this without any apology. This the best place you can sit tonight in this entire valley in this entire Northwest because you're hearing things that are absolutely true that the angel of God stood behind and the angel of God supernaturally proved it. Said that's true. And here we are tonight and we we've got such a privilege. And so I just say to you, I was young. I've been I've had a young family. I've had children, educate them, and they're here tonight. Grandchildren are here tonight. But you know, we just constantly tried to give somewhere. just give some help somewhere and give you yourself. And I want to say to this congregation, God bless you and bless you as you seek to give of yourself and just seek every area you can that you can find. Let your let your radar be out there and see who you can help and who you can bless. And I think that I I I really pray that you take those words very very seriously. &gt;&gt; And I'll tell you one of the things that you'll face. People turn around and they'll almost envy you be because they see the blessing of God on you, but they don't know why the blessing's there. &gt;&gt; I want to I want to speak of just one family while I'm I'm here for this moment. I I I highly respect our sister Tracy and Brother Murphy. I told Brother Murphy I'd like to adopt him if he'd take the name Biscoll. He's got a family of his own was the same size as mine. And he's added other children and young people and Mary and Jason and the other sister here and and they're staying in their house. And they've just kept making their house bigger and and making more room for more people because not because it's easy, but because that's just there's really nothing else to do. &gt;&gt; You just do that. &gt;&gt; And when uh people read and they say, "Well, oh, Brother Ed, you worked amongst the native Indian people and and the native people." But when the native people came to Victoria and I lived in Victoria, uh, Brother Kyle, Sister Christine, I lived in Victoria and they felt welcome and they came and slept in the basement wherever there was room just like Cord would and and and I expected them to be there. I expected them because they were my friends. There were people that I and when I went and not one time, not one time in all the years that I went up there amongst them and the different reservations, not one time did I sleep in a motel or stay in a white man's house. I stayed with them every time and stayed in their place. My wife, I took her there and she stayed there and stayed in a three- room house for a few days of meetings and and there were 17 people in the house, one bedroom, and my wife and I had the bedroom. Listen, friends, people know when they're welcome. People know I'm just not talking about hospitality, but this this church, even what it is right now, it's because it's been a giving church. If somebody wants a tape, get a tape to them. And I have another quote here. Brother Brando said, you know, uh, we got some books. Well, you know, and and we got some pictures and things and, uh, we sell them for just what we have to pay for them, but if you want them and you can't pay, don't worry about it. You you can just have it. And that's the way we've been. &gt;&gt; And the people overseas, they know that's the way we've been. And if we can possibly do it, we just want to help them. I want that's been it's been up to 2013. And by God's grace, it'll continue in the coming years. Amen. God bless you. [applause] &gt;&gt; Wow. Amen. Well, we probably better have another group come up. So, let's have uh Daryl and Mayan and Karen come up and get ready. Just after they're done singing, we'll have Jessica and Charity Caldwell and Andrew Rivas come up and sing. Amen. As they're coming, why don't we sing 1199? How deep the Father's love is. [music] How deep the Father's love for us. How blessed [music] beyond all measure that he should give his holy [music] son to make his treasure.

And now [music] I can see that yesterday's [music] [singing] battles yesterday battles are today's [music] victory. [music] &gt;&gt; [applause] [music] &gt;&gt; In the foothills of sorrow, looking up from the valley [music and singing] of fear, you can see down off in the distance [music] and [singing] you're about to lose heart right here. But don't [music and singing] be discouraged. Don't never give up. God is with [singing] you [music] and you'll overcome. &gt;&gt; [music] &gt;&gt; The mountain will tell you that you can't [music] make it over. It will [singing] try to convince you [music] that it's way too high.

Michael Ray is going to come. We aren't [music] ready for that. Yeah. Just the chorus. [music] All the fourth man [music] between [singing] the plain and I when [music] there [singing] was no at all [music and singing] just in time [music] for Every time I say [music] I for the [music] I [music] [singing] for the we stand one more &gt;&gt; [music] &gt;&gt; He made a way to die [music] when there was no [music] [singing] glory.

Well, just as they're getting ready, we'll one more second. All right. We've looked around the room. Have you looked around the room a little bit? Amen. It's good to be amongst friends. &gt;&gt; It's good to have our families around us. &gt;&gt; It's good to have the body of Christ. Each one is a very integral part. If you've uh gone without a member of your body very long, you realize very quickly that it's missing. &gt;&gt; It's true. &gt;&gt; Try and go to work without being able to use your arm because it's bundled up because you've heard it. The other one has to do a lot of extra work. There's a lot of pain and suffering that happens when part of the body is missing. I see you're smiling, Brother James. It's good. It's good to have you back. Understand brother Joseph is packed and is heading down to Louisiana, but we understand those things. But it's good to have each one of you here. Bless you, brother Jeff. From the camp, we express our appreciation for a very wonderful year out of Mount Baker Bible Way Camp. The Lord has really, really blessed the camp. How many have been able to enjoy going out to the camp? I would like more of you to enjoy that. And I mean that sincerely. And I don't mean to come out and volunteer. Brother Steven came all the way from Grand Prairie to come and stay in a cabin for a couple of nights. Shame on us if we live close and we don't go out and enjoy the camp. The Lord's given it &gt;&gt; to the body of Christ for the body of Christ. Amen. We should use it thus. There's a lot of uh other churches that get to use the camp. There's a lot of other youth groups that get to enjoy the camp. I think it would be a shame if we don't enjoy the camp. &gt;&gt; Amen. God bless you. We look forward to another wonderful year serving the body. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Well, almost at the end of a year, I think maybe we will cross over during our song. It's been a wonderful year. But uh this little this song is a one of one of my favorites and I think it's a a for me it's a song that I'm privileged I can sing at the close of 2012. Uh it's how can we say thanks for the things that the Lord has done for us. And uh we I lassued my my aunts to sing backup for me. So forgive them if it's a if we uh you know bumble around a little bit but but it's only to give the glory to our Lord. And so uh maybe at the end if uh you can join in this very simple course and I'm sure many of you have heard it before. So hopefully it blesses you. [music] How &gt;&gt; [music] &gt;&gt; Can I say thanks for the things [music] you have done for me. [music] Things [singing] so undeserved. [music] Yet you give to prove your love for me. The voices [music and singing] of a million angels [music] could not express my gratitude. [music] All that I am and ever hope to [music] be. I owe it all to thee. [music] To God [music] be the glory. [singing] To God [music] be the glory to God. [singing and music] be the glory for the [music] things he has done. [singing] With his [music] blood he has [singing] saved me. [music] With his power he has raised to [music] God [singing] be the glory for the things he [music] has [singing] done. Just let me live [music] my life. Oh, let it be pleasing, [singing] Lord, to thee. And [music] should I gain any praise, [singing] let it go [music] to Calary. With his blood [music] he has saved [singing] me. With his heart [music] he has raised me to God [music] be the [singing] glory for the [music] things he has done. Just let me [singing] live. &gt;&gt; [music] &gt;&gt; my life. Let it be [singing] pleasing, Lord, [music] to thee. And should I gain any [singing] praise, [music] let it go to hell. With his [music] blood [singing] he has saved me. [music and singing] With his power he has saved me. [singing] To God [music] be the glory for the things he [music] has done. &gt;&gt; [music] &gt;&gt; Amen. Should we sing it together? It's a simple chorus. [music] To [singing] God be the glory.

[applause] Hallelujah. Glory. We thank him. Thank him for his word. Thank him for his presence. Thank him for his spirit. Thank him for what he's done for you this past year. Thank him for what he's going to do for you in this next year. &gt;&gt; There's a rapture to attain, saints. &gt;&gt; We're just crossing over. &gt;&gt; Amen. Glory. &gt;&gt; We want to praise him. We want to thank him. Just think, just think, just think, saints of God, if God hadn't come by with this resurrected message for you, you would be in some church somewhere, maybe in some pub somewhere, hitting some pans and pots together. I don't know what that means, but by the grace of God here, you're in the house of God with the redeemed of God. &gt;&gt; Glory. We're with the saints from Seattle. &gt;&gt; [applause] &gt;&gt; from the Philippines, from Canada, US. [applause] Heaven has come down amongst us. Glory [applause] My heart is filled. &gt;&gt; My heart is filled to see the ones that have have sung tonight, the brothers that have spoken tonight and those that have prepared and will not be singing tonight. You will be singing. &gt;&gt; There we do have other services. So don't you worry. But I want you to appreciate what is around you. &gt;&gt; I want you to look at one another and say, "That's the redeemed of God. God died on a cross for my brother, my sister. I want to appreciate them more in 2013. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; May have your seats. I'm just going to be a few minutes. And if you want to if you want to stand when I whatever I'm saying and you want to lift up your hand, Brother Bren, I just heard him the other day. He said, "Where are those days?" He said, "When you come to church and the Holy Spirit speaks to the brother and he just raises to his feet and lift up his hand, walks down the aisle and sits back down." He says, "We need that Holy Spirit again." &gt;&gt; Amen. Come on. &gt;&gt; The Bible says in Psalms 104, "Enter into his gates with thanksgiving and into his courts with praise. Be thankful unto him and bless his name." What I saw tonight was a thanksgiving &gt;&gt; for the thanksgiving. &gt;&gt; What I see tonight &gt;&gt; is the thanksgiving for the thanksgiving. &gt;&gt; And I am thankful for what Christ has done in every one of your lives. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I am deeply appreciated to my lovely Lord Jesus for your lives and how it's impacted me. Amen. &gt;&gt; I want to give God thanks tonight. &gt;&gt; I want to thank you for your kindness. I want to thank you for your generosity. &gt;&gt; I want to thank you for your giving, your cards, your emails, your letters, your prayers, your encouragement for myself and my dear wife, for my family which you are. I want to thank God for every one of you. Amen. &gt;&gt; I thank God for a visionary man of God, father in the faith, &gt;&gt; my pastor, your pastor. I thank God for the man of God. [applause] &gt;&gt; Let's enter his church with thanksgiving and praise. [applause] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. What a year. What an unvealing. What a word. What a blessing. [applause] Glory. [applause] Hallelujah. I will never ever be able to express through the eternities my thanksgiving. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I thank God for raising young men such as brother Kyla. I thank God for raising up brother Peter Ivanko and he couldn't be here tonight to greet you. So I want to greet you on his behalf. I want to greet you on brother Kelly Hildbrerbrand's pastor in Grandthal Saskatchewan. He wanted me to pass along his loving greetings. I talked to brother Jason Watkins also. These are brothers. These are precious brothers of the gospel. I'm thankful for their lives. I am thankful for the burden that you had, brother Kyle, to see what we saw tonight and what we'll continue to see. &gt;&gt; I never thought that I would be in the Bible like that. The travels of St. Thomas. I don't have that quite in my Cambridge Bible. Maybe you want to send them that map. But I wanted to say the other day, saints, listen, when we say the word saints and you stood and and you stood up in appreciation for what God's done for you last Sunday. To make a saint in the Catholic Church, there has to be one miracle within their lives. &gt;&gt; And sometimes they take five or seven or 15 years trying to find a miracle within their lives so that they can be a saint. I want to tell you, you are the miracle and you are the living saint of the Bible. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I don't have to look five years. I see it from service to service. How the Holy Spirit delivers, sets free, &gt;&gt; heals, and touches and saves. I say to God be the glory. &gt;&gt; Great things he has done. &gt;&gt; Amen. I want to thank God and I've had the privilege to be associated with the caliber of brothers that handle the word of God here at Cloverdale Bible Way. &gt;&gt; You have got brother John Andes. You have got brother Murphy. You got brother Timothy Maul. You have brother Ken Andes. You have brother Ernie Vil Noea. We've got brother Dominic that God is starting to use. and and move amongst us. Brother Tim Dodd has felt led to come and help us and soldiering with us here in Cloverdale. I thank God for these God called men, &gt;&gt; for wonderful deacons, &gt;&gt; for trustees that care for this church, &gt;&gt; that give of their time many hours. I thank God for their labors. For those that labor in the office that are it's hardly mentioned, but they are the ones that have kept this like it's it's it's just wonderful to see the gifts operating in the body and seeing how that God had put within the church and we hardly even recognize them. But Sarah who puts in so much, &gt;&gt; we thank God for sister Sarah Ash. [applause] &gt;&gt; [applause] &gt;&gt; not just say anything of sister Debbie and the years the years she has put in the church and brother Aaron and brother Michael. [applause] Praise the Lord. Brother Alex, God bless you. Thank you. Thank you. I am humbled. I am humbled that that man picks up my Kleenex. &gt;&gt; I'm humbled, Alex. And I thank God for you. &gt;&gt; I love you, too. Every volunteer that helps at our camps, every one of you that did just one little thing. And we've had the privilege to baptize over 250 of our young people over the years. I say to God, &gt;&gt; be the glory. &gt;&gt; Great things he has done. [applause] &gt;&gt; Praise him. Thank him. &gt;&gt; [applause] &gt;&gt; Brother Derek and Sister Debbie and what they've done and and all the sisters that have helped and labored and worked over the years. It it it's been marvelous to see every volunteer, every laborer in every area. I give you my humble appreciation for all you've done for the gospel. Means so much to me. &gt;&gt; We will hold this banner high. Amen. &gt;&gt; We will not let it fall to the ground. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Thankful indeed. I am. The Bible says in Philippians 4 and4, &gt;&gt; rejoice in the Lord always and I say rejoice. &gt;&gt; I rejoice in the Lord in the good times. &gt;&gt; And again I say rejoice. I say we will rejoice in the bad times. &gt;&gt; Then I say again to you the church, let's rejoice. &gt;&gt; Good times, bad times. &gt;&gt; We are going through. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You know what the Bible says in Matthew 2 and 10? When the wise men saw the star, you know what the Bible says? When they saw the star, they &gt;&gt; rejoiced. And I'm saying tonight because I saw the seventh star &gt;&gt; in the hand of God &gt;&gt; and that word is creating in me a new body. &gt;&gt; I want to say praise be to God. &gt;&gt; Could God be the glory great things he's not only done but he is doing now and will do. &gt;&gt; Have you rejoiced &gt;&gt; to see the star? 1 Thessalonians 5:16. We're 50 14 minutes into the new year and the world is just starting. &gt;&gt; But I do understand we are not children of the night. &gt;&gt; We're children of the day and I understand that. And so I will not hold you much longer. 1 Thessalonians 5:16 says, "Rejoice evermore." &gt;&gt; Then I ask you tonight, what are we rejoicing in? &gt;&gt; Watchmen, what of the night? &gt;&gt; It's dark here, Brother Tom. And it's gloomy, Brother Tom. And I can barely put up with what's out there. Brother Bram says, "Hey, you're always saying how dark it is." and how bad it is. He says, "Don't you see how bright it's getting &gt;&gt; and how powerful the church is getting?" &gt;&gt; I say, "Praise God, &gt;&gt; watchmen, what are the night?" Hey, it's the rising of the sun. &gt;&gt; It's the great emancipation. &gt;&gt; It's our deliverance that has come. &gt;&gt; And so I say to you tonight, can we rejoice &gt;&gt; in God's messenger? Can we rejoice in the message? &gt;&gt; Can we rejoice in the word of God? &gt;&gt; Amen. Because this message makes Christ alive. At the time when a people can actually say, "Give me that book." &gt;&gt; Can you rejoice tonight &gt;&gt; knowing that brother Bram said when you have taken the abstract title deed, &gt;&gt; when you've taken that title deed and you have possessed the abstract, are you ready? All your sins are gone. &gt;&gt; Can you rejoice tonight? Because the devil wants you to look back and see all your failures, but the word of God wants to see the victory that is in the revealing of the word. &gt;&gt; Glory. &gt;&gt; Amen. The abstract, all sins are gone. Your sins are struck out. and the blood of Jesus Christ, the Holy Ghost as an abstract to the title that God give me by grace by fornowledge. Oh my. &gt;&gt; Oh my. &gt;&gt; The abstract title deed. This is going to now come down to the close so that you can rejoice. The abstract title deed means your debt is settled forever. Amen. &gt;&gt; Saints, listen. &gt;&gt; Because Satan will come to you and he will point back to every one of your failures and mistakes &gt;&gt; and he is very good for that. But I want you to take first John 1 &gt;&gt; where it says that the blood of Jesus Christ &gt;&gt; cleanses me from &gt;&gt; all sle. &gt;&gt; I say again, &gt;&gt; rejoice. rejoice in what God has blessed us with this year and what he will continue to do in the year ahead. I wanted to actually speak on the bride's revival. &gt;&gt; And Lord willing, next time I minister, I want to minister on this is the bride's revival. &gt;&gt; And I say to you again, rejoice because the word of God has been open to you. And you are a possessor of that abstract title. All your sins are gone. Your debt is paid. And you can say tonight, I am free, free, free. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. [applause] [applause] &gt;&gt; Last scripture. This one, you can rejoice with me. This one put a smile on every one of your faces. This one, you're going to go out of the church of God tonight rejoicing because you are an abstract holder, a title deed holder. My Bible says, and your Bible says this in Hebrews 13:5, "Let your conversation be without covetousness. Be content with such things as you have. For he has said, for he has said, &gt;&gt; I will never leave thee, &gt;&gt; nor forsake thee." &gt;&gt; Amen. Can you rejoice tonight? [applause] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. What a promise of a work. &gt;&gt; Drive darkness away, won't it? Watchmen, what of the night? My Bible says, I will never leave you. I will never forsake you. &gt;&gt; The Lord is my helper, and I will not fear what men will do to me. &gt;&gt; I say, praise be to God. That's good scripture for you. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. That is the Bible. Are you ready for now another translation? Maybe help you to put a smile on your face at the end of this time. He God himself has said, "I will not in any way fail you nor give you up nor leave you without support. I will not. &gt;&gt; I will not." &gt;&gt; I will not. Can you imagine a translation putting that down three times because it's got to be in the mouth of two or three witnesses? &gt;&gt; The word of God is saying to you, I will not I will not I will not ever forsake you. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord, believers. God bless you for doing your part. &gt;&gt; Then I say to you tonight, let's press the battle like we've never pressed before. Let's run the race like we've never run before. &gt;&gt; Let's take up the charge that has been given us tonight from these faithful brethren. Let's hold the word dear to our hearts. Let's go on and say, "Onward, Christian soldier." &gt;&gt; Please stand with me. Musicians as they come. to thank him individually. Now, as we go to prayer and close the service, I'm going to ask brother Ken Andes to come. We missed you at the very beginning, so we're not going to miss you tonight. Brother Ken, you are on my minister's list of appreciation to thank you for your labors for many years. &gt;&gt; I still have the books. I will never put them down by the grace of God. And when I re when I read them, I think of you often &gt;&gt; and I thank God for you. &gt;&gt; Can we lift up our hands &gt;&gt; and in your own way? &gt;&gt; Thank the Lord &gt;&gt; coming into his courts &gt;&gt; with thanksgiving.
