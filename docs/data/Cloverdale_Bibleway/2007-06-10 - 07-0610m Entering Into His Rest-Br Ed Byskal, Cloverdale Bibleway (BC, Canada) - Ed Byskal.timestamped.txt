[15:28] Bless you all. You may have your seats.
[15:32] Amen. We want to bless his name. We want
[15:34] to give him glory.
[15:37] This is announcement for the events that
[15:40] will be coming up for the summer. in
[15:43] particular the camp announcement for
[15:46] August the 6th to the 12th that um we'll
[15:49] find after the convention. It will be
[15:52] sneaking up on us very quickly. So,
[15:54] Brother Biscll has asked that we be in
[15:56] prayer now over this season for the
[15:58] convention that God will minister and
[16:01] speak to lives and through the various
[16:03] ministry that we'll God will use. But we
[16:06] want to just add a little thing there.
[16:08] pray also now for the for the family
[16:11] camp that's coming up. Um I'd like to
[16:14] announce uh who will be speaking. It'll
[16:16] be brother Aaron McGary. He'll be taking
[16:19] the uh camp for us. He's uh graciously
[16:22] accepted our invitation and we're
[16:24] looking to having a wonderful time. He's
[16:25] been a a great blessing to the assembly
[16:27] and to our young people over the years
[16:30] and uh we're looking for a very very
[16:32] special time. Uh, junior camp will be
[16:35] from August the 6th, 7th, and 8th.
[16:37] Senior camp will be 9th, 10th, 11th, and
[16:40] 12th. And as always, and it's I'm
[16:44] thankful for it, there's more for us
[16:46] than there is against us. And I mean
[16:48] that by there's more counselors for us
[16:50] than there is against us. And we have
[16:53] too many. And that's a good problem. And
[16:55] I I want to thank those that uh that
[16:58] have submitted their names and have
[17:00] agreed to be our counselors this year.
[17:02] And if we haven't used you, uh, Lord
[17:04] willing, if God should give us another
[17:06] year, we will use you in some way or cap
[17:09] in some capacity. Um, our numbers, as
[17:12] you see, the church is growing. And, um,
[17:15] we're having families and and as they
[17:17] grow older, there's less beds. and our
[17:20] our senior uh campers, which are the
[17:23] 2122 age group, they're actually going
[17:26] to be junior counselors or assistant
[17:29] counselors because we need their beds
[17:31] for the growing crop that's coming up
[17:33] from underneath them. So, you can see
[17:35] our dilemma. At first, brother Jess
[17:37] didn't think that we would have enough
[17:38] room even at this camp, and we were
[17:41] contemplating bringing in trailers or
[17:43] tents or doing something drastic. But as
[17:45] it is with shifting that older uh cabin,
[17:48] bringing him in as counselors and
[17:50] dropping off actually the number of
[17:52] senior counselors, we've got enough room
[17:54] this year. So uh we're thankful to the
[17:57] Lord for that. So be in prayer for for
[18:00] the camp. Be in prayer for brother Aaron
[18:02] McGary. When I was talking to him, he's
[18:05] excited. And uh you know, Brother Aaron,
[18:07] he's he's revved up uh 7,000 revs
[18:11] already and ready to go. So, we just
[18:13] want to pop the clutch and let the Holy
[18:14] Spirit come and minister to our
[18:16] children. God bless you.
[18:22] Thanks, brother Tom. And we also have a
[18:24] couple of announcements to make. Um
[18:27] there is a choir practice this uh for
[18:29] the junior choir this afternoon at 3:00
[18:32] here at the church. Um, also, uh, for
[18:36] the family and friends of the 2007
[18:38] graduating class, this is people who are
[18:41] graduating from grade 12. Uh, this is a
[18:44] reminder that grad is this Tuesday, June
[18:46] the 12th, at Newand's Golf and Country
[18:48] Club. Grads and family come at 5:30 and
[18:50] guests, please come at 6 p.m. Uh, the
[18:54] choir has a song for us this morning,
[18:56] senior choir, I believe, and if they
[18:57] could come and gather at this time. We
[18:59] also want to welcome those who are
[19:01] visiting with us and a special welcome
[19:03] to uh uh Sister Stephanie Coin from

[19:12] others who are visiting with us. We want
[19:14] to uh extend a real welcome. Let's sing

[19:40] [Music]
[19:46] Give him glory all
[19:52] for
[19:54] his blood washed away.
[19:59] [Music]
[20:23] [Music]
[20:40] No one knew
[20:42] how alone
[20:45] I was feeling
[20:49] and the emptiness
[20:52] I tried so hard to hide.
[20:57] Though I laughed and said, "My life is
[21:02] fine without you."
[21:07] I was covering up the secret tears. I
[21:12] cried.
[21:15] And one day
[21:20] of your mercy
[21:24] and the love you show on a hill called
[21:28] Calvary
[21:32] there you
[21:35] [Music]
[21:36] purchased my redemption
[21:41] when you broke sin's power and said my
[21:45] spirit free.
[21:50] I'm amazed
[21:53] that you love me.
[21:56] [Music]
[21:58] I'm amazed
[22:02] how you came
[22:06] through your preious
[22:09] blood.
[22:11] [Music]
[22:14] And my sins
[22:17] are
[22:19] all washed away. All my sins
[22:25] are washed
[22:27] away.
[22:34] &gt;&gt; Yes, it's true. There have been days
[22:38] when I failed you.
[22:43] Lord, you know the many times I've gone
[22:47] astray.
[22:50] But I've learned your love is stronger
[22:54] than my weakness.
[22:59] And your ear is open every time I pray.
[23:06] No one else has ever cared for me like
[23:11] you, Lord.
[23:15] Other friends could never be as close to
[23:19] me.
[23:22] I'm not afraid to face the problems of
[23:27] tomorrow.
[23:30] Knowing you are everything I'll ever

[27:12] Praising my savior
[27:17] all the day long.
[27:21] This is my story.
[27:26] This is my song.
[27:29] [Music]
[27:32] Myior
[27:34] [Music]
[27:40] perfect
[27:48] [Music]
[27:54] on my side.
[27:58] Oh, an angel descending.
[28:02] They bring from
[28:07] Oh, echo of mercy
[28:12] and whispers of love.
[28:17] This is my story.
[28:22] This is my song.
[28:27] myior
[28:31] all the
[28:35] Oh, this is my story.
[28:40] This is my song.
[28:53] Oh, and perfect submission.
[28:58] All is at rest.
[29:03] I am my Savior
[29:07] and happy and
[29:12] watching and waiting
[29:16] for King.
[29:21] filled with his goodness
[29:25] and lost in his love.
[29:30] This is my
[29:36] song.
[29:38] I'm praising myior
[29:44] all day long.
[29:48] This is my story.
[29:53] This is my song.
[29:57] Oh, praising my
[30:00] [Music]
[30:08] story.
[30:11] This is my song.

[30:25] This is my story.
[30:29] This is my song.

[30:58] all day long.
[31:02] This is my story.
[31:07] This is my song.
[31:10] [Music]
[31:21] I believe it was the psalmist David that
[31:24] said, "I will say to my soul, praise ye
[31:26] the Lord."
[31:27] &gt;&gt; Sometime we have to tell our soul
[31:31] &gt;&gt; you're going to praise God.
[31:33] &gt;&gt; You didn't come here just to warm a
[31:34] seat.
[31:35] &gt;&gt; You came here to be a participant. You
[31:38] came here while you've got breath in
[31:40] your lungs and in your body and life to
[31:43] say something of of the grace of God.
[31:47] And that's the best way I know to do it.
[31:49] I'll praise him. I'll give him glory.
[31:51] &gt;&gt; And the the last verse of that chorus,
[31:54] the verse of the song we just sang,
[31:56] perfect submission, all is at rest, is
[31:59] so much in keeping with the service this
[32:01] morning that I feel on my heart to
[32:03] speak. I'd like to sing that verse
[32:05] again. And just before we just before we
[32:08] do, I would like to just make these
[32:10] comments.
[32:12] Uh we're very much in preparation for
[32:14] the convention which is taking place. I
[32:17] want to uh show my appreciation for all
[32:20] of those that are uh putting such an
[32:23] effort out and there's a lot of effort
[32:24] out for those of you that have opened
[32:26] your homes. Uh I see for myself there
[32:30] are two real thrusts
[32:34] that I feel in my spirit
[32:38] uh that I would like to see happen. And
[32:42] one is I'd like that the congregation
[32:45] here would be an example message church.
[32:50] And I believe that you are. I just want
[32:53] that to be expressed in a very wonderful
[32:56] way to all the people that will be
[32:59] coming in our conduct, in our
[33:03] hospitality,
[33:05] in our zeal,
[33:08] and in our a holy ghostfilled life. I
[33:12] believe that we can be that and express
[33:14] that and be an encouragement to others
[33:18] so that they can visit here and say we
[33:21] had a glorious time. We heard a rich
[33:23] word. We met wonderful people and we go
[33:27] home with uh an an edified
[33:32] that we want to continue with this kind
[33:35] of atmosphere. You believe that's
[33:37] possible? Why we have a message? Why?
[33:40] Why can't we have a model message
[33:42] church? Do you believe it? I don't want
[33:44] to feel like I'm pulling a sled over dry
[33:46] ground now. Do you believe it?
[33:49] &gt;&gt; All right, then let's let's just say,
[33:51] well, we will do that by God's grace.
[33:53] We'll do that. And the second thrust is
[33:56] that we
[33:58] it has just been my own personal
[34:01] uh insatiable desire which I never never
[34:04] can get away from, neither do I want to
[34:06] get away from it. And that is to provide
[34:09] the message to the peoples of the world
[34:12] in the language they can understand.
[34:14] Something that you and I so enjoy. And
[34:18] we just become enraptured with the words
[34:21] that God sent to us through his prophet
[34:23] messenger that we can dedicate ourselves
[34:26] and say we will do all that we can to
[34:29] see that this reaches as far as possible
[34:32] uh to as many people as possible to
[34:34] whatever doors that God opens to us. So,
[34:37] we want to be remembering also
[34:39] especially brother Tony is still in uh
[34:42] Brazil and attending to some things.
[34:45] He's got some real burdens down there.
[34:48] And so, I also want to say you've been
[34:50] praying that the different pastors will
[34:52] be able to get visas to come. Uh brother
[34:55] Vernon from the Philippines got his visa
[34:58] this last week. We're very happy over
[35:00] that. Brother Cesar and his wife got
[35:02] their visas from Brazil. And uh so
[35:05] there's over 70 pastors from probably
[35:08] somewhere between 15 and 20 countries
[35:11] that have now confirmed are able to be
[35:14] here. So we're really thankful about
[35:16] that. And for those of you that are
[35:18] streaming on the internet,
[35:22] uh we we want you to know that we
[35:26] certainly appreciate your prayers and
[35:27] your comments and there are many. uh
[35:31] last last Sunday there was somewhere
[35:35] around 170 some locations that were live
[35:39] streaming during the service while
[35:40] you're here worshiping
[35:42] and uh and from that day to this from
[35:45] Sunday to Sunday there was about another
[35:48] 300 and some that had connected through
[35:52] the archiving because their timing is
[35:54] not right. China and some of these
[35:57] countries and from over 33 or not over
[36:00] but 33 nations
[36:02] with 304 I believe it was. I very rarely
[36:06] look but I just wanted to let you know
[36:09] that this is a real live audience and we
[36:13] are participating with them and they are
[36:15] participating with us and we just want
[36:17] to say God's blessings upon them in the
[36:20] name of our Lord Jesus Christ.
[36:23] Remember also beginning next Sunday,
[36:25] next Sunday will just be one one Sunday
[36:27] service. It'll be we're going to go one
[36:29] Sunday service now for the summer during
[36:32] the congestion on the on the border. I
[36:36] know sometimes it's not congested, other
[36:38] times it's terribly congested, but we're
[36:39] going to have a we'll we'll just count
[36:42] on having a camp meeting every Sunday
[36:44] morning. And how long it goes, we don't
[36:47] know. We're not going to drag it out on
[36:49] purpose, but we're going to be here with
[36:51] no time restraints. Amen.
[36:55] Hallelujah.
[36:58] Well,
[36:59] I believe I got enough support for that
[37:01] to do it.
[37:05] Amen.
[37:11] They've been praying for this service.
[37:13] Did you put your order in for this
[37:15] service?
[37:17] Amen. And there's a baptismal tonight.
[37:20] At least two are being baptized.
[37:24] It's wonderful what God is doing.
[37:25] Friends, one of the young men is going
[37:28] to be baptized
[37:30] tonight is a real blessing. Uh this this
[37:36] is the time God moved on him last
[37:38] Sunday. And I understand, I can't say
[37:41] his testimony, but I understand. I
[37:43] haven't talked with him directly, but I
[37:45] understand he's never been to the front.
[37:49] He's never been baptized
[37:51] from one of our good believing families,
[37:54] but he's going to be baptized tonight.
[37:57] And soon as he had that experience last
[38:00] Sunday morning, he's told our brother
[38:03] Tom, I just can't get enough of the word
[38:06] of God. have an insatiable thirst for
[38:09] the word of God. I can't pass a message
[38:11] book without picking it up and reading
[38:13] it and devouring it. That's a good sign.
[38:16] &gt;&gt; It's a good sign.
[38:19] Hallelujah.
[38:21] Get hungry right away. Amen. That
[38:25] wonderful.
[38:30] There's a man here in the congregation
[38:33] and he won't mind me saying this, I'm
[38:35] sure, but I just shook hands with him
[38:38] last Sunday morning coming into the
[38:39] service and brother Mike Causaleno said,
[38:42] "I'd like a little prayer cloth. Do you
[38:44] have a prayer cloth?" I said, "Yes."
[38:46] Said, "I'd like a prayer cloth for my
[38:48] friend." I shook hands with him.
[38:51] Brother Mike Causalino said, "This man
[38:54] knew Brother Tom Ray
[38:56] before he was married."
[38:59] Oh, I was shaking hands with him.
[39:03] So I said, "So you knew Brother Tom
[39:05] Ray?"
[39:07] He said, "So I said, "Safeway?"
[39:11] He said, "Yes, Safeway. We worked
[39:14] together at Safeway."
[39:17] Says it. And then he got converted.
[39:20] And I thought this is, he may not
[39:23] realize this, but I was
[39:26] I was just stunned
[39:29] that over 30 years, probably 33 years,
[39:34] and I'm standing here in front of our
[39:37] church doors with a man that's seated
[39:40] here now.
[39:42] And he remembers of one of the associate
[39:45] ministers here. And the first thing he
[39:48] remembers is before he was married. And
[39:51] the second thing he remembers then he
[39:53] got converted.
[39:57] The testimony friends. You might think
[39:59] it's forgotten. It's not forgotten.
[40:03] God knows exactly the moment. And
[40:06] letting that light shine. Amen. Blessed
[40:09] assurance,
[40:11] perfect submission. Hallelujah. Can you
[40:13] sing it with me now?
[40:18] [Music]
[40:21] All is restless at rest.
[40:26] I am myior.
[40:31] I'm happy and
[40:36] watching and waiting.
[40:41] and the king of
[40:45] [Music]
[40:48] his
[40:52] washing.
[40:55] [Music]
[40:57] This is my story.
[41:02] This is my song.
[41:06] I'm praising myior
[41:11] [Music]
[41:12] all day long.
[41:17] This is my story.
[41:22] This is my song.
[41:25] [Music]
[41:27] Praising myior
[41:30] [Music]
[41:32] all the day.
[41:36] [Music]
[41:38] We'll pray. Heavenly Father,
[41:41] we are so privileged and so thankful
[41:44] that we can address you and approach you
[41:47] and call you our father.
[41:50] That we have come from your loins.
[41:53] We've come from the father's genes. And
[41:56] where we have come from is where we will
[41:58] go back to. We thank you for eternal
[42:01] life through Jesus Christ, God's lamb,
[42:05] the sacrificed lamb. Oh, thank you for
[42:09] the blood that was shed, the price was
[42:12] paid, and the words of our Lord Jesus
[42:15] could say and did say, "It is finished."
[42:19] Today, Lord, we rest in that finished
[42:21] work. Today we rejoice in that finished
[42:24] work and that you have sent the Holy
[42:27] Spirit down within these human vessels
[42:30] giving witness and testimony that the
[42:33] work is a finished work. Bless this
[42:35] congregation, the visible congregation,
[42:39] the internet congregation and all who
[42:42] may ever participate in this service.
[42:44] May the ho same Holy Spirit present here
[42:48] now be present everywhere. Lord, pray
[42:51] you'll bless us now with a spirit of
[42:53] revelation as we read your scripture.
[42:56] For you are the author and we're
[42:58] trusting you as the author. Make known
[43:00] this message to us, oh God. Give
[43:02] understanding, I pray, in the name of
[43:05] Jesus Christ. Amen.
[43:09] I'll invite you to turn in your Bibles
[43:11] to the book of Hebrews, if you would,
[43:14] the third chapter.
[43:27] beginning to read at the seventh verse
[43:31] and then we're going to continue in the
[43:33] fourth chapter for six verses.
[43:38] Wherefore, as the Holy Ghost saith
[43:40] today, if you will hear his voice,
[43:43] harden not your heart as in the
[43:44] provocation in the day of temptation in
[43:47] the wilderness. When your fathers
[43:49] tempted me, proved me and saw my works
[43:52] 40 years. Wherefore I was grieved with
[43:55] that generation, and said, they do all
[43:58] we heir in their heart, and they have
[44:00] not known my ways. So I swear in my
[44:03] wrath, they shall not enter into my
[44:05] rest. Take heed, brethren, lest there be
[44:09] in any of you an evil heart of unbelief
[44:11] in departing from the living God. But
[44:14] exhort one another daily while it is
[44:16] called today, lest any of you be
[44:19] hardened through the deceitfulness of
[44:22] sin. I want to just stop there to say
[44:24] unbelief. Unbelief has a hardening
[44:27] effect through the hardened through the
[44:31] deceitfulness of sin. Sin is also
[44:34] deceitful and it is hardening of of of
[44:38] our spirit. For we are made verse 14.
[44:41] For we are made partakers of Christ if
[44:44] we hold the beginning of our confidence
[44:47] steadfast unto the end. While it is said
[44:50] today, if you will hear his voice,
[44:53] harden not your hearts as in the
[44:54] provocation.
[44:56] For some, when they had heard, did
[44:58] provoke, how be it not all that came out
[45:01] of Egypt by Moses. But with whom was he
[45:04] grieved 40 years? Was it not with them
[45:07] that sinned, whose carcasses fell in the
[45:10] wilderness? And to whom swear he that
[45:13] they should not enter into his rest, but
[45:16] to them that believed not. So we see
[45:19] that they could not enter in because of
[45:21] unbelief. Let us therefore fear, lest a
[45:26] promise being left us of entering into
[45:28] his rest, any of you should seem to come
[45:31] short of it. For unto us was the gospel
[45:34] preached as well as unto them. But the
[45:37] word preached did not profit them, not
[45:40] being mixed with faith in them that
[45:42] heard it. For we which have believed do
[45:45] enter into rest, as he said, as I have
[45:49] sworn in my wrath, if they shall enter
[45:51] into my rest, although the works were
[45:54] finished from the foundation of the
[45:56] world, for he spake in a certain place
[46:01] of the seventh day on this wise, and God
[46:04] did rest the seventh day from all his
[46:06] works. and in this place again if they
[46:10] shall enter into my rest, seeing
[46:13] therefore it remainth that some must
[46:17] enter therein,
[46:19] and they to whom it was first preached
[46:22] entered not in because of unbelief. It
[46:25] remainth that some must enter therein.
[46:30] &gt;&gt; God bless you as you have your seats.
[46:41] Some must enter in.
[46:45] It remainth that some must enter in. I'm
[46:48] glad that has in there. I identify with
[46:52] that.
[46:53] I'm I'm some of that must. I'm one of
[46:57] those. You're one of those. That's got
[46:59] to be a personal witness within your own
[47:01] soul. There are some that must enter in
[47:05] and I'm part of that group.
[47:08] &gt;&gt; Amen. And to enter in and uh the word
[47:12] that Paul has used here
[47:16] is not just to enter as we may think of
[47:19] entering into a place such as this, but
[47:22] the an entrance into any condition. an
[47:26] entrance into any condition or two and
[47:28] the word also implies to arise and come
[47:32] into existence.
[47:34] In other words, prior to this entering
[47:36] in, we may be the person that we are,
[47:39] but we don't we haven't really come into
[47:41] our existence. We haven't come into what
[47:45] we are to be or what is intended for us
[47:48] to be. And so Paul is saying here and
[47:53] using this word throughout these two
[47:55] chapters. And if you'll notice please
[47:58] that the Bible is calling it God is
[48:01] calling it my rest. Not your rest but
[48:05] it's my rest. God's rest. We're entering
[48:09] into his rest. That's what the scripture
[48:12] is speaking about. And only by coming
[48:15] into his rest can we really be in the
[48:19] right place. Only coming into his rest
[48:22] can we be can we come into what I would
[48:25] say true existence. Outside of that
[48:29] we're not having a true existence.
[48:33] we come to life and to come to come into
[48:38] real true existence or our real true
[48:42] condition
[48:44] right at this time of the year we've in
[48:47] this part of the world at least in North
[48:48] America United States Canada our
[48:51] students are completing school many of
[48:55] them completing their 12th grade of
[48:58] education
[49:00] looking forward perhaps to further
[49:02] education
[49:04] and uh we will have grad ceremonies many
[49:08] of you in the next couple of weeks. So
[49:11] you'll be completing and concluding that
[49:13] part of your life your education and
[49:18] looking forward to whatever else you
[49:20] might be doing. A lot of decisions
[49:24] decisions will be made at a different
[49:27] level now when the young people come
[49:30] into that uh time and you'll be facing
[49:34] challenges
[49:35] uh unchartered waters that you've never
[49:39] traversed
[49:40] new pathways
[49:42] and we can say decisions decisions
[49:45] plenty of them. You want to have the
[49:46] Holy Spirit guiding you in this part of
[49:49] your life. And for those that are
[49:52] looking towards a further education,
[49:56] some field of education,
[49:59] I understand that many colleges,
[50:03] uh, universities, they require an
[50:06] entrance exam
[50:10] and there is an entrance procedure
[50:13] there. They may require and I I looked
[50:16] into it because that's what I'm speaking
[50:18] of, entering in to this rest, entering
[50:22] into this condition, entering into your
[50:25] true existence. And now some of you that
[50:28] have finished this phase of your
[50:30] education, you want to enter into what I
[50:33] really want to be, what I expect to be,
[50:36] what my true existence will be in life.
[50:39] I'm going to be this or I'm going to be
[50:40] something else. And I want to prepare
[50:42] myself. And so now I need further
[50:45] education to to uh get the kind of uh
[50:49] skills that I will require for the rest
[50:52] of my life. And even to enter into what
[50:55] your true existence will be, you've got
[50:57] to have a uh you've got to go through
[51:00] some procedures for your entrance exams.
[51:03] And it said um uh you must try your best
[51:06] to perform well on these exams. And I
[51:10] can say that is true also in the
[51:12] spiritual sense. Your performance on the
[51:15] required entrance exam is only one part
[51:19] of the admission criteria. Other
[51:23] criteria include your grade point
[51:26] average
[51:27] uh or your marks, your scores, uh
[51:30] letters of recommendations perhaps
[51:33] essays etc.
[51:36] This is just for natural education.
[51:39] You are well advised to take these exams
[51:42] seriously.
[51:44] And if that applies there, how much more
[51:46] so? Now,
[51:48] a sound preparation can enhance your
[51:51] performance significantly.
[51:54] Help is abundantly available and I can
[51:56] say that is certainly the case here.
[51:59] Help is abundantly available in the form
[52:02] of information on the web and books and
[52:04] coaching and classes.
[52:06] research what is be research what is
[52:09] best for you and what you can afford.
[52:12] Well, let me say to you, you can afford
[52:14] this
[52:16] and we're having not merely a
[52:18] convention. We're not having a
[52:19] convention to have a convention. We
[52:20] haven't had it for 10 years. And soon as
[52:23] we announced we would have that, you
[52:25] know, then brother Tom, some of the
[52:27] brothers here asked, "Well, will we have
[52:29] family camp?" I said, "I believe that we
[52:31] need to have family camp. I don't think
[52:33] that our our people will forgive us if
[52:36] we don't have a family camp because it's
[52:38] a great time when it's it's not a
[52:41] convention atmosphere. It's a family
[52:42] camp atmosphere where parents are
[52:45] mingling with their children and and our
[52:47] vision and desire I think this is 21
[52:49] years. Every year we've had family camp
[52:52] and have gone from probably 60 young
[52:55] people to almost 400 young people and uh
[52:59] from maybe two 300 on the camp or maybe
[53:03] even less than 200 to last year I think
[53:05] they filled a thousand seats we had
[53:08] rented had a thousand seats under the
[53:10] tent and this is not just a you know
[53:13] this is not a a time of frivolity and
[53:15] just and so on but it's a time when
[53:18] family relationships are forged together
[53:21] when mothers and fathers are able to be
[53:23] with their young people. And the desire
[53:26] because out out in the world, the spirit
[53:29] of the world is so uh intent on
[53:32] destroying the family, the family ties.
[53:36] And that's the first thing that Satan
[53:38] did in the in Eden was dismember the
[53:41] family. And we are opposed to that. We
[53:45] are absolutely directly opposed to it.
[53:47] We believe in the family. We believe
[53:49] that God has ordained that we shall have
[53:52] family. And I believe as father, as a
[53:54] father myself, you can't take my place.
[53:57] I can't take yours. But as a father,
[53:59] I've claimed my family for God.
[54:02] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. My children and my
[54:04] children's children. And I say the
[54:07] devil's a liar.
[54:08] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And whatever he may attempt
[54:10] to do and whatever he succeeds in doing,
[54:13] I don't call it an ultimate success. I
[54:15] call him an ultimate failure. And the
[54:18] and the promise of God is yay and amen.
[54:21] Hallelujah. And I won't let anyone take
[54:23] that away from me. And don't let anyone
[54:24] take that away from you. If you want to
[54:26] follow in the footsteps of your pastor,
[54:28] you can follow in those footsteps. God's
[54:31] word is true.
[54:32] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And we believe the the
[54:35] circle shall not be broken on the other
[54:37] side. Hallelujah.
[54:40] &gt;&gt; Say, well, what if it looks impossible?
[54:42] God is a God of the impossible.
[54:44] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[54:52] today
[54:54] in this time many of you that will are
[54:57] graduating and I don't want to spend
[54:59] much time on this because I want to get
[55:00] to the scripture but this is certainly a
[55:02] good foundation for it you will be
[55:05] making more decisions I went and heard a
[55:09] woman's a few years ago speak to a
[55:11] graduating class when some of our young
[55:14] people were graduating out of the 12th
[55:16] grade. And she said at that time, she
[55:20] said
[55:22] some years ago, you would only uh
[55:26] prepare for one one profession and you
[55:28] would expect to stay in that profession
[55:31] for the rest of your days. But you said
[55:34] most of you will have as many as five
[55:37] jobs.
[55:38] You'll train for five different jobs.
[55:41] And today there are many more decisions
[55:43] than just making a decision for one.
[55:46] People used to work for one or two
[55:48] lawyers in a lifetime. But the US
[55:50] Department of Labor stats show that
[55:53] today both men and women between the
[55:56] ages of 18 to 40 will have over 10 jobs
[56:02] in their lifetime. Over 10 different
[56:04] jobs. So it's doubled even since I sat
[56:07] in that graduating class a few years
[56:09] ago. So there's a lot of decisions that
[56:12] are being made. Instead of a young
[56:14] person saying, "I'm going to be a
[56:15] doctor. I'm going to be this." They
[56:17] might be that for the rest of their
[56:18] life. But the average American has 10
[56:21] jobs that between 18 and and 40 year old
[56:25] Americans. And that is what uh we have
[56:29] garnered from their website.
[56:32] And they say that also that the average
[56:34] family moves
[56:37] 12 times. The average American family
[56:41] moves an 12 times in their lifetime. And
[56:46] so the families today are much more
[56:49] transcendent, much more moving. And
[56:51] moving is a big decision. Moving is a
[56:54] costly decision. And I have said to so
[56:57] many here that have moved and have come
[56:59] here, you can pull up your roots in five
[57:03] minutes, but you can't put them down in
[57:05] five. and it's putting them down. That
[57:08] that really takes some time and some
[57:10] patience and there's hardship and work
[57:12] and labor and putting your roots down.
[57:14] You can put them up in just a few
[57:16] moments. Say, "Let's go pack up. We're
[57:18] out of here. We're history." But to then
[57:21] to change u your place of dwelling,
[57:25] change the whole atmosphere, the whole
[57:27] environment,
[57:29] your conditions, your culture, your job,
[57:33] your position. and some of those would
[57:35] you it's a it's a tearing experience.
[57:39] And so, uh, I'm just saying that by way
[57:42] of of of a foundation for the for the
[57:45] service this morning. I'm not speaking
[57:46] about that. But I do believe that, uh,
[57:50] we must be prepared. The songwriter
[57:52] said, "I've been traveling for Jesus so
[57:56] much of my life.
[57:59] Been traveling or land or or on sea."
[58:02] And I said, "Well, amen to that.
[58:04] But I'm planning on taking a trip to the
[58:06] sky and that will be the last move for
[58:10] me.
[58:12] He went on to say here I'm bothered with
[58:14] packing each time that I move and carry
[58:18] a load in each hand, but I'll not need
[58:21] one thing that I've used in this world
[58:24] when I move to that heavenly land.
[58:29] when I make my last move.
[58:33] Hallelujah.
[58:38] We all are faced with our own unique set
[58:41] of circumstances. We sit here today
[58:45] beside family perhaps husband wife
[58:50] individual our friends our peers
[58:54] and uh I would say there isn't a person
[58:56] here but what we are facing some sort of
[58:59] a decision as I spoke on decisions last
[59:02] Sunday carrying on a wee bit but I'm
[59:04] wanting to come now to where I really
[59:06] wanted to approach last Sunday service
[59:11] uh we want to make a move in our
[59:13] spiritual life. We want to perhaps, and
[59:17] I may not be speaking to 100% of the
[59:19] congregation, but I think I'll be
[59:20] speaking to most everyone. We want to
[59:23] move from where we are spiritually
[59:26] to another dimension,
[59:29] to another level, and I'm sure we all
[59:31] hunger after that. And I'm going to take
[59:34] a message that the prophet of God left
[59:36] us and how he broke it down, and it is
[59:39] incredibly revealing and enlightening.
[59:42] And I feel that when I have covered what
[59:44] he has said, it will cover every single
[59:48] person in this building. Not a not one
[59:51] person will be left out. And so you can
[59:54] look for that part that refers to you.
[59:57] In the scripture which we've read,
[1:00:01] Hebrews is written by the Apostle Paul.
[1:00:04] And the Apostle Paul is writing to the
[1:00:07] Hebrews. And he has two main concerns
[1:00:11] because they are Jews and he is a Jew
[1:00:14] and he can understand what it is to
[1:00:18] because they're they're they're leaving
[1:00:20] one element and moving to another and
[1:00:22] that is the they're they're leaving
[1:00:24] essentially the law and all of its all
[1:00:28] of its regulations and all of its
[1:00:31] washings and all of these things.
[1:00:35] And Rabbi Richmond has said and also
[1:00:37] Garrison Solomon has said and I've heard
[1:00:39] them both say it that the law had 600
[1:00:42] they have 613 laws in the Old Testament
[1:00:46] and Jews keep those laws. The
[1:00:49] ultraorththodox Jews attempt to keep
[1:00:52] those 613
[1:00:55] laws which are left from the Old
[1:00:56] Testament. Paul knew something of the
[1:01:00] struggle of the Jews coming out of that
[1:01:05] out of Judaism
[1:01:06] and in into followers of Christ to
[1:01:10] become believers of Christ. And so the
[1:01:14] two themes that are in Hebrews which
[1:01:16] will now apply to the scripture we read.
[1:01:19] He was wanting to prove to the Jewish
[1:01:22] Christians
[1:01:24] that Judaism as they had known it had
[1:01:28] come to an end
[1:01:30] through the fulfillment of the scripture
[1:01:34] in Jesus Christ. That he was the
[1:01:36] fulfillment
[1:01:37] of the whole purpose of God in the law.
[1:01:41] And so that now now it was to have faith
[1:01:43] in Christ.
[1:01:45] And and it seems so simplistic. I'm sure
[1:01:48] it was difficult because they were they
[1:01:50] were uh so trained from childhood from
[1:01:53] birth. They had to do things. You have
[1:01:55] to do this, you have to do this washing.
[1:01:57] You have to do it a certain way and all
[1:01:59] of these sacrifices a certain way and
[1:02:01] the way we eat and the way we dress and
[1:02:03] the way we do everything. And now Paul
[1:02:05] is trying to tell them that this has
[1:02:09] been completed in Christ. Christ is the
[1:02:13] fulfillment and the end of the law. And
[1:02:16] then secondly that there was a danger a
[1:02:20] very real danger with these new
[1:02:22] believers for we can identify with this.
[1:02:26] There was a danger that the Jewish
[1:02:28] believers would lapse back would lapse
[1:02:32] back into Judaism
[1:02:35] or simply pause and not move forward in
[1:02:39] the message of the hour. And we
[1:02:42] certainly can identify with that.
[1:02:45] There's a danger. Many of us come from
[1:02:48] all kinds of denominations and churches
[1:02:50] and whatever more and and there's a
[1:02:52] danger within the message of lapsing
[1:02:54] back and and and hanging on to traits of
[1:02:58] the past and hanging on to forms of the
[1:03:01] past and things that have been dragged
[1:03:03] in from uh we'll say Christianity,
[1:03:08] churchity, uh the religious world.
[1:03:11] dragging those things up, say, "Well, we
[1:03:13] need to continue with those." Or coming
[1:03:17] into the message, and then and then just
[1:03:20] becoming uh stagnant, not moving
[1:03:23] forward, saying, "Well, well, you know,
[1:03:25] this is good enough." Yeah. Okay. God
[1:03:27] sent a prophet. Malachi 4, Luke 17:30,
[1:03:30] fine, wonderful. And you know, Godhead,
[1:03:33] baptism, serpent seed, whatever more.
[1:03:35] And then we we remain there and we don't
[1:03:38] move forward. That's what Paul was
[1:03:41] saying and that is why he he he could
[1:03:44] say that because even him himself he
[1:03:47] made this testimony.
[1:03:49] He said, "Though I might have also
[1:03:52] confidence in the flesh, if any other
[1:03:54] man thinkketh that he hath whereof he
[1:03:57] may trust in the flesh, I more." He's
[1:04:00] establishing himself as a Jew. to the
[1:04:02] Philippians. He said, "I'm circumcised
[1:04:04] circumcised the eighth day of the stalk
[1:04:07] of Israel, of the tribe of Benjamin and
[1:04:11] Hebrew of the Hebrew as concerning
[1:04:14] touching the law, a Pharisee, and
[1:04:17] concerning zeal, persecuting the church,
[1:04:20] touching the righteousness which is of
[1:04:22] the law, blameless." I, if anybody's a
[1:04:25] Jew, he says, "I'm a Jew.
[1:04:27] &gt;&gt; I'm a circumcised the eighth day. I'm of
[1:04:29] the tribe of Benjamin. I'm a zealous
[1:04:32] Jew. I'm I I've kept the law to
[1:04:35] perfection and all of those things. And
[1:04:37] so he was saying that, you know, I have
[1:04:39] a right. I know what it is that you're
[1:04:42] going through. And to you Hebrews, you
[1:04:44] must not pause. You must not lapse back.
[1:04:47] And you must not just stay where you
[1:04:49] are. There is a rest.
[1:04:51] &gt;&gt; There's another place. And we must enter
[1:04:54] into that rest. We must, in other words,
[1:04:57] inherit everything that God purchased
[1:04:59] for us.
[1:05:01] Why sit and be idle? Why sit and just
[1:05:03] lapse back? Why be satisfied with less
[1:05:06] than what God has provided for us?
[1:05:09] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:05:12] &gt;&gt; So Paul could say as he did in Hebrews
[1:05:16] 6, he said, "Therefore, leaving the
[1:05:18] principles of the doctrine of Christ,
[1:05:21] let us go on to perfection, not laying
[1:05:25] again the foundation of repentance from
[1:05:27] dead works and faith towards God." You
[1:05:29] know, there are some even within the
[1:05:31] message say, "Well, I'm just staying
[1:05:32] with the ABCs. I'm just staying with the
[1:05:35] ABCs." Well, I can tell you, Apostle
[1:05:37] Paul would rebuke anybody saying that,
[1:05:40] saying it's much more than ABCs. Some
[1:05:42] people want to stay in their own comfort
[1:05:44] zone and just say, "Well, I just, you
[1:05:46] know, stay with the simple things. It's
[1:05:48] it's, hey, whatever whatever the prophet
[1:05:51] of God delivered, that's what he intends
[1:05:53] us to eat." God didn't send it to us to,
[1:05:55] you know, just to look at and put it and
[1:05:57] hang it on the wall and put the book in
[1:05:59] a as a as a a display in a cabinet or
[1:06:04] something. God intended the people to
[1:06:06] participate and take a hold of it and to
[1:06:08] have it lived out.
[1:06:10] &gt;&gt; There's a message for this hour.
[1:06:13] &gt;&gt; Amen. So leaving the principles of the
[1:06:16] doctrine of Christ, let us go on unto
[1:06:19] perfection, not laying again the
[1:06:20] foundation of repentance from dead works
[1:06:23] and faith towards God. So Paul is
[1:06:25] saying, let us move on from that.
[1:06:28] Perfection in this case, the first word
[1:06:32] that perfection means is a finisher.
[1:06:34] Paul was a finisher. Paul said in in
[1:06:38] Acts the 20th chapter, he said, "And
[1:06:40] now, behold, I go bound in the spirit
[1:06:44] unto Jerusalem, not knowing the things
[1:06:47] that shall befall me there, save except
[1:06:50] he knew this, say that the Holy Spirit
[1:06:53] has witnessed in every city, saying that
[1:06:56] bonds and afflictions abide me." So I
[1:07:00] don't know what's going to befall me
[1:07:01] completely. But the Holy Spirit is also
[1:07:03] witnessed that in every city bonds and
[1:07:06] afflictions uh abide me. Those things
[1:07:09] will be with me. But he says, "But none
[1:07:12] of these things move me. Neither count I
[1:07:15] my life dear unto myself so that I might
[1:07:20] finish my course
[1:07:23] &gt;&gt; with joy. Not that I be dragged out in
[1:07:26] the end and get through by the skin of
[1:07:28] my teeth. But he says,"None of these
[1:07:30] things." And listen friends, we don't
[1:07:32] want to take this as a sermon this
[1:07:34] morning. You've got to apply it to your
[1:07:35] own self. The Holy Spirit witnesses to
[1:07:38] me that I'm not in a Sunday school
[1:07:39] picnic. The Holy Spirit witnesses to me
[1:07:42] that this way won't be an easy way.
[1:07:44] Whatever my future is, the Holy Spirit
[1:07:46] witnesses to me this will be a battle.
[1:07:49] And the prophet says, "I'll fight for
[1:07:50] every inch." And you got to be resolved
[1:07:52] in your heart. I'm prepared to fight for
[1:07:54] every end. Nothing shall move me. None
[1:07:57] of these things move me. Can this
[1:07:59] congregation say amen? Down in your soul
[1:08:01] cannot resound an amen. Nothing shall
[1:08:04] move me. Don't be caught in my
[1:08:06] inspiration. Be caught in your own
[1:08:08] inspiration. Don't be caught in my
[1:08:10] witness. Be caught in your own witness.
[1:08:12] None of these things shall move me.
[1:08:14] Nothing that Satan can throw in my way.
[1:08:16] No enchantment, no enticement.
[1:08:19] Hallelujah. Nothing of these things
[1:08:22] shall move me. I know that there's
[1:08:24] afflictions that abide me. The Holy
[1:08:26] Spirit witnesses this won't be an easy
[1:08:28] way, but I'm going to finish my course
[1:08:30] with joy. That is perfection.
[1:08:34] I'm going to I'm going to be mature
[1:08:36] enough that I can make that kind of of a
[1:08:39] decision. And that is why Apostle Paul
[1:08:41] could also say he could say that I have
[1:08:45] I have finished my course. He said to
[1:08:48] Timothy, I have finished my course. Here
[1:08:50] he was saying that I may finish my
[1:08:52] course. But then he was able to write
[1:08:55] that old apostle to Timothy said, I have
[1:08:58] finished my course. Glory to God.
[1:09:00] Therefore, there's a crown laid up for
[1:09:02] me. We every person here wants to be
[1:09:05] able to make that testimony
[1:09:09] to complete.
[1:09:13] Let us go on to perfection. Let's
[1:09:15] complete the journey to accomplish what
[1:09:19] we've been called to accomplish. And
[1:09:21] Paul is saying, let us go on to full
[1:09:23] age. Don't let us remain as children.
[1:09:26] Oh, they didn't shake my hand. They
[1:09:28] didn't look at me just right. Or or this
[1:09:31] thing, I had a bad day. What's that got
[1:09:33] to do with it?
[1:09:34] &gt;&gt; That's got nothing to do with it. I'm
[1:09:36] going through a tough time. You're
[1:09:38] supposed to expect that.
[1:09:41] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. You're to expect that.
[1:09:45] We haven't been called to an easy way.
[1:09:48] It also says in in Hebrews, Paul's
[1:09:52] telling the Hebrews, for when the time
[1:09:55] that you ought to be teachers, you have
[1:09:57] need that one teach you again, which be
[1:10:00] the first principles. Now, he's talking
[1:10:02] to the Jewish believers. He's talking to
[1:10:04] people that came into the message.
[1:10:05] That's who he's talking to. He's not
[1:10:07] talking to a bunch of unbelievers. He's
[1:10:09] talking to people who came into the
[1:10:10] message. said by the time when you
[1:10:13] should be teachers said then you have
[1:10:15] need to be taught again of the first
[1:10:18] principles of the oracles of God and are
[1:10:21] become such as have need of milk and not
[1:10:24] of strong meat but strong meat belongth
[1:10:27] to them that are of full age that he's
[1:10:29] talking about coming to perfection let's
[1:10:31] move to perfection and belongs to them
[1:10:34] of full age even those who by reason of
[1:10:38] use have their senses
[1:10:40] exercise to discern both good and evil.
[1:10:47] &gt;&gt; Therefore, it remainth
[1:10:50] that some must enter into my rest.
[1:10:54] Brother Brandham takes the tabernacle of
[1:10:56] the wilderness.
[1:10:58] I was going to put it on the screen, but
[1:11:00] I'm not going to distract you with it
[1:11:01] now. The tabernacle in the wilderness
[1:11:04] was built in three parts as is. It has
[1:11:08] direct reference and this is fundamental
[1:11:10] to a lot of you but many and some of our
[1:11:12] young people coming up. It has direct
[1:11:15] reference to your physical body, your
[1:11:17] physical being.
[1:11:19] You are body, you are spirit and you are
[1:11:23] soul. Your body has a five channels.
[1:11:27] Your spirit has five channels. And a lot
[1:11:30] of people can't remember those five
[1:11:32] channels. I don't have the best memory
[1:11:33] in the world, but I I use my own little
[1:11:37] code and I use it. My car for the for
[1:11:41] the five channels to the to the spirit.
[1:11:45] My car, M for your memory, I for your
[1:11:49] imagination,
[1:11:51] C for your conscience, A for your
[1:11:55] affection, and R for reasoning. And four
[1:11:59] of those five are in the mind.
[1:12:03] And it involves your affection, your
[1:12:06] memory, what you think, your
[1:12:07] imagination, what you can be, all of
[1:12:10] these things. And they are so close.
[1:12:12] Now, the the scripture which the prophet
[1:12:15] used all the time throughout his entire
[1:12:18] ministry is this one. For the word of
[1:12:20] God is quick and powerful. Now, here's
[1:12:23] where Pentecost and so many religions
[1:12:25] and so many theologians and men of great
[1:12:28] learning, they missed it completely
[1:12:31] because when the prophet of God was
[1:12:33] standing there discerning the secrets of
[1:12:35] the people's hearts, they thought, "What
[1:12:37] a marvelous gift. Oh, God has given a
[1:12:39] gift of discernment." It was no gift of
[1:12:41] discernment. And he kept using this
[1:12:44] scripture and they should have caught
[1:12:45] it. They should have caught it. He said
[1:12:47] it over and over, hundreds and hundreds
[1:12:49] of times. For the word of God is quick
[1:12:52] and powerful and sharper than any
[1:12:55] two-edged sword. Not the gift of God,
[1:12:59] the word of God. The word of God. God's
[1:13:03] breath.
[1:13:05] &gt;&gt; God's own breath.
[1:13:08] &gt;&gt; God's word. Not a man's word. Not
[1:13:11] William Brandham's word or Ed Bisc's
[1:13:13] word or anybody else's word. The word of
[1:13:16] God is quick and powerful and sharper
[1:13:19] than any two-edged sword, piercing even
[1:13:23] to the dividing of soul and spirit, not
[1:13:29] body and spirit. It doesn't take the
[1:13:31] word to divide between this flesh and my
[1:13:34] spirit, but between the spirit and the
[1:13:37] soul because they are so closely merged
[1:13:40] together. They're not one, but they're
[1:13:43] so closely merged together. That's why
[1:13:45] when a lot of young people are coming to
[1:13:48] uh the state of the emotion that's
[1:13:50] involved with courtship and and who I'll
[1:13:53] marry and and marriage and so on, it is
[1:13:55] so close that emotional that highly
[1:13:58] concentrated emotional area and and and
[1:14:04] I say, you know, well, are you really
[1:14:06] certain? Well, yeah, I'm I'm absolutely
[1:14:08] certain because, you know, because of
[1:14:09] this and I've seen that sign and etc.
[1:14:11] etc. And only the word can actually
[1:14:14] divide between
[1:14:16] &gt;&gt; what is spirit and what is soul. Only
[1:14:20] the w only the message of the hour. Only
[1:14:22] theology can't do it. Catechism can't do
[1:14:25] it. Sunday schools can't do it. Uh even
[1:14:28] preachers can't do it. But the word that
[1:14:30] comes sent from God out of the
[1:14:33] messenger's mouth can divide. It has a
[1:14:37] it has a surgical accuracy to divide
[1:14:40] between the spirit and the soul.
[1:14:45] And the word can divide between the
[1:14:47] spirit and the soul. And so
[1:14:51] we have now the outer court
[1:14:55] which is the your body. We have the
[1:14:58] inner court. It's called also the holy
[1:15:01] place
[1:15:03] which is your spirit realm. And then and
[1:15:06] then there is the holy of holies. And
[1:15:09] there was a curtain between the holy
[1:15:12] place and the holy of holies. And in the
[1:15:15] outer court the people congregation
[1:15:18] could come. In the inner court was where
[1:15:22] the priests came to minister. And in the
[1:15:25] holy of holies only the high priest once
[1:15:28] a year not without blood could enter
[1:15:32] into the holy of holies. And in each of
[1:15:34] these places, they had their various
[1:15:37] instruments and the various vessels. And
[1:15:40] they had a certain kind of an altar. And
[1:15:42] then you go into the holy place. They
[1:15:44] had the altar of showbread, the table of
[1:15:47] showbread, and the candlestick in the
[1:15:50] holy place. But in the holy of holies
[1:15:52] was only the ark of the covenant with
[1:15:55] the cherubam standing over it with their
[1:15:57] wings touching. And that was and the
[1:16:00] word of God laying in the ark of the
[1:16:03] covenant. And you are body, spirit, and
[1:16:06] soul.
[1:16:08] And in the outer court, we have certain
[1:16:11] needs, certain requirements, and God has
[1:16:13] provided for that. And in the inner
[1:16:15] court where the priests could go, they
[1:16:18] there are different kind of implements
[1:16:20] and and altars and so on and different
[1:16:23] kind of light there. And in the holy of
[1:16:25] holies was different. And God said to
[1:16:28] Moses, "You will make a tabernacle. This
[1:16:32] is how you'll make it." And he's made
[1:16:35] these words so that I may dwell there.
[1:16:40] &gt;&gt; And the word that God has sent has been
[1:16:44] designed specifically for your soul.
[1:16:48] &gt;&gt; Now, there are benefits which flow to
[1:16:50] your emotional realm. There's benefits
[1:16:53] which flow to all the other realm.
[1:16:55] There's benefits which flow to you
[1:16:57] physically. But now how the prophet's
[1:17:00] message and how the prophet's ministry
[1:17:02] came out and first started to touch the
[1:17:04] body, take people by the hand. And the
[1:17:07] and the religious world for the most
[1:17:09] part became consumed with that. Oh, I
[1:17:13] just need healing. Oh, if you'll just
[1:17:15] tell me my sickness. They're missing it.
[1:17:18] &gt;&gt; This was the vessel that would send the
[1:17:19] word and heal the soul.
[1:17:23] It's our souls that needed healing. The
[1:17:26] altar needed to be rebuilt.
[1:17:28] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? It's your soul,
[1:17:30] friend. And then when the word reaches
[1:17:32] the soul, see, Satan has reverse this
[1:17:35] thing. But when the word of God, the
[1:17:37] revelation of the word reaches your soul
[1:17:41] and takes control and you're born again,
[1:17:44] born of the spirit and the word, then
[1:17:47] that new birth begins to emanate and
[1:17:49] rise up and takes charge and control of
[1:17:53] the spirit realm. Then that word takes
[1:17:56] control of your imagination. That word
[1:17:59] takes control of your memory because
[1:18:01] there's some things in your memory you
[1:18:03] should remember. And there's some things
[1:18:05] in your memory you must forget. And only
[1:18:08] the word can decipher what should be
[1:18:10] forgotten and what should be remembered.
[1:18:13] It's got to come from the soul. Come up
[1:18:15] and take and clear out that memory
[1:18:17] channel. Some of you people here today
[1:18:19] got memories you need to forget.
[1:18:23] &gt;&gt; It's been plaguing your mind and you
[1:18:25] need to forget it. You need to put it on
[1:18:27] God's altar and let the holy fire of God
[1:18:30] consume it and end it all.
[1:18:34] &gt;&gt; And I say you need to move.
[1:18:36] &gt;&gt; You need to move today.
[1:18:39] &gt;&gt; You need to make the decision. I'm
[1:18:41] moving.
[1:18:42] &gt;&gt; I'm packing up.
[1:18:44] &gt;&gt; I'm leaving that behind. I'm letting the
[1:18:47] word minister. I'm going to let the word
[1:18:49] decide what I remember and what I
[1:18:51] forget.
[1:18:52] &gt;&gt; And then into the imagination. People
[1:18:54] imagine all kinds of things. People even
[1:18:56] have an imaginary
[1:18:59] Oh my, this is another whole message.
[1:19:00] Help me now.
[1:19:02] &gt;&gt; They have an an imaginary
[1:19:06] uh they have an imaginary Jesus.
[1:19:09] &gt;&gt; The world has an imaginary Jesus. And
[1:19:12] they're not in love with the Jesus of
[1:19:14] the Bible. They're in love with the
[1:19:16] Jesus of their imagination.
[1:19:20] &gt;&gt; And there's a danger right within the
[1:19:21] message.
[1:19:23] Well, what did Jesus say to the
[1:19:25] Pharisees and the people of his day? Oh,
[1:19:27] people were dressed right. You couldn't
[1:19:30] lay a finger on their lives. If they
[1:19:33] were believers of today, you couldn't
[1:19:34] even put a finger on their lives. They
[1:19:36] were so precise and so perfect. Jesus
[1:19:39] said,
[1:19:41] "Your fathers,
[1:19:44] your fathers, you garnish the tombs. You
[1:19:47] spend your time making the tombs of the
[1:19:50] prophets go there with all their
[1:19:52] righteous feeling and everything and all
[1:19:54] the outward appearance, garnishing and
[1:19:57] giving honor to the prophets that had
[1:20:00] died. Jesus said, "You hypocrites, your
[1:20:03] fathers killed them and put them in
[1:20:05] there." But you see those men, if you
[1:20:08] told them and said, "You hate the
[1:20:09] prophets." So, what are you saying?
[1:20:12] That's a blasphemy to us. We don't hate
[1:20:15] the prophets. We love the prophets.
[1:20:17] Jesus said, "Your fathers killed the
[1:20:19] prophets." But what they did, they had
[1:20:21] garnished, they had they had
[1:20:25] they had honored the position of the
[1:20:28] prophets and they had built an imaginary
[1:20:32] image of what the prophets were. And
[1:20:35] they were in love with that image, not
[1:20:38] the prophet themselves. And a lot of
[1:20:40] people today say, "Oh, brother
[1:20:41] Brandham." And they get brother Brandham
[1:20:43] into a place and into an exalted place
[1:20:46] and a position and something. God
[1:20:48] exalted him. God put him in the place
[1:20:50] that he had, but they get him in some
[1:20:52] kind of a place. And if they had lived
[1:20:54] maybe back there with him and just seen
[1:20:56] him as a human man and making the
[1:20:58] mistakes that he made or living the life
[1:21:01] that he lived, you might not have been
[1:21:02] impressed with it.
[1:21:03] &gt;&gt; But what So you say, "Well, today what
[1:21:05] are people impressed with?" You're
[1:21:07] impressed with what your imagination has
[1:21:09] constructed.
[1:21:10] That's what you're impressed with.
[1:21:14] &gt;&gt; If you lived right then when Jesus lived
[1:21:17] and you saw his frailty and he did
[1:21:19] things that you might understand. People
[1:21:21] picked up stones to stone him and he ran
[1:21:23] and dispensing. You might say what's he
[1:21:26] doing? You know, I believe he's a god in
[1:21:28] the flesh. What's God in the flesh
[1:21:30] running from?
[1:21:35] &gt;&gt; And you might not be impressed with
[1:21:36] that. Yeah.
[1:21:39] &gt;&gt; And a lot of other things which he did.
[1:21:41] He weary and maybe sat just healed
[1:21:45] somebody lame and oh lay over here and
[1:21:48] with a headache.
[1:21:51] Tempted in all points
[1:21:54] &gt;&gt; as every man.
[1:21:56] &gt;&gt; Tempted in all points. Is that what the
[1:21:58] scripture says? But the image that
[1:22:01] people have constructed is a Christ that
[1:22:03] never was tempted, never had any
[1:22:05] difficult, never was anything. That's
[1:22:07] you're in love with your image.
[1:22:10] &gt;&gt; You're in love not with the real person.
[1:22:13] You're in love with what you've
[1:22:14] constructed him to be.
[1:22:18] &gt;&gt; I hadn't planned on getting into that,
[1:22:21] but that's why you need you need the
[1:22:23] word.
[1:22:26] You need the word to come and and
[1:22:28] separate in the imagination
[1:22:33] and in your conscience.
[1:22:38] How many people are condemned that are
[1:22:40] real born again believers? You're
[1:22:42] condemned
[1:22:43] and and and and hang on. Guilt hangs on
[1:22:46] to you. You can't seem to shake free of
[1:22:49] it. That condemnation has no right. Your
[1:22:52] conscience has no right to cloud your
[1:22:55] life
[1:22:57] &gt;&gt; with condemnation. For the word of God
[1:23:00] has said, here it comes, quick and
[1:23:01] powerful and sharper than any two-edged
[1:23:04] sword. For there is therefore now no
[1:23:07] condemnation
[1:23:09] &gt;&gt; to them who are in Christ Jesus. So the
[1:23:12] question is, am I in Christ Jesus? And
[1:23:14] if you can say, yay, amen, I am in
[1:23:17] Christ Jesus, then there is now
[1:23:18] therefore no condemnation to them which
[1:23:20] are in Christ Jesus. So your memory,
[1:23:22] Satan tries to poke something in your
[1:23:24] memory channel, say, "Oh, look at this
[1:23:25] back there." And try to bring
[1:23:27] condemnation on you and you say, "Well,
[1:23:29] now I'll just let the word come up into
[1:23:31] that memory channel and clear that one
[1:23:33] out."
[1:23:34] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. For there's now therefore no
[1:23:37] condemnation. I don't care what kind of
[1:23:39] a failure it has been. I don't care what
[1:23:41] what has happened in the past. The blood
[1:23:43] of Jesus Christ has cleansed that
[1:23:45] perfectly. And if he hasn't, then he
[1:23:47] failed. He died in vain at Calvary.
[1:23:51] So people want to think of the power of
[1:23:52] Calvary but somehow they want to give uh
[1:23:56] consideration to Satan to have control
[1:23:58] of our lives. He hasn't got any control
[1:24:00] of our lives.
[1:24:02] &gt;&gt; And the prophet of God has said that
[1:24:03] when that sin is confessed, it drops
[1:24:06] into the bleach of the blood of Jesus
[1:24:08] Christ and it breaks up. That bleach
[1:24:10] actually breaks up. It literally breaks
[1:24:13] up. Is this what he said?
[1:24:14] &gt;&gt; Is this what he said? It breaks up the
[1:24:17] very elements of the of the of the ink.
[1:24:22] &gt;&gt; And you've heard me say it. And he says,
[1:24:24] "Even the ink becomes bleach."
[1:24:27] &gt;&gt; It is so purging and so purifying and so
[1:24:31] powerful. Your sin is no match for the
[1:24:35] blood of Jesus Christ.
[1:24:38] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:24:43] So it remained that some must enter in.
[1:24:46] I'm preaching this this morning because
[1:24:48] there may be some here that have to move
[1:24:50] from the outer court. And so now we have
[1:24:53] these three courts.
[1:24:55] I'm going to move along qui quickly. I'm
[1:24:57] going to give the brother Brandham's
[1:25:00] description of the outer court.
[1:25:03] He said, "Many Christians in my life,"
[1:25:06] He's seen many Christians in his life to
[1:25:09] be up and down.
[1:25:12] Seems to have such a deep desire
[1:25:17] daily. They search
[1:25:20] and hunt and seek for God
[1:25:24] and never come to any settlement of any
[1:25:27] kind to where they could ever be settled
[1:25:30] or anchored in Christ. This is I'm
[1:25:33] describing the outer court.
[1:25:37] I've inserted the scripture.
[1:25:40] Jesus spoke of the swer and the seed
[1:25:44] and he spoke of the one group and he
[1:25:46] says and they have no root in themselves
[1:25:51] and so they endure but for a short time
[1:25:53] and afterward when affliction or
[1:25:56] persecution ariseth for the world's for
[1:26:00] the word's sake because of the word soon
[1:26:03] as persecution arise or affliction
[1:26:05] because of the word's sake immediately
[1:26:07] they are offended
[1:26:09] That is why I spoke of decisions. We
[1:26:13] need and especially
[1:26:16] those that have have given themselves to
[1:26:19] this message. We need to have a resolve
[1:26:21] because a resolve also is a part of
[1:26:24] faith. A resolve that and and speak the
[1:26:28] words of Apostle Paul. Say them to
[1:26:31] yourself today. None of these things
[1:26:35] shall move me.
[1:26:37] I know that there's bonds. I know that
[1:26:40] there's afflictions. There can be all
[1:26:42] kinds of trouble. Whatever it might be,
[1:26:45] but none of these things shall move me.
[1:26:48] And if you say, "Well, I've been up and
[1:26:49] down. I've been in and out. I've been
[1:26:51] unstable.
[1:26:53] I've been so that I have no I need an
[1:26:55] anchor."
[1:26:57] Then I'm telling you what to do today.
[1:26:59] If I was sitting across the desk from
[1:27:01] you, if you were in my office or we I
[1:27:03] was in your home, you say, "Brother Ed,
[1:27:06] what shall I do?" I'll tell you what to
[1:27:08] do. Pack up and get ready to move.
[1:27:13] Where are you going to move? Well, I
[1:27:15] would pack up and say, "I'm not stopping
[1:27:17] in this outer court anymore. I'm not
[1:27:20] dwelling here anymore. I'm not having my
[1:27:22] ups and downs anymore. I'm not going to
[1:27:24] be moved by these distresses anymore.
[1:27:27] I'm moving out of here. Hallelujah. Pick
[1:27:30] up your bags if you have any and move on
[1:27:33] onto the holy place and right on into
[1:27:35] the Holy of Holies.
[1:27:39] &gt;&gt; He speaks about these people.
[1:27:43] He said the one intellectually
[1:27:45] intellectually is hungering.
[1:27:48] He's feasting on God, but his feast
[1:27:52] doesn't hold out.
[1:27:55] You might be here and no doubt some are
[1:27:59] intellectually
[1:28:00] is hungering for God and feasting on God
[1:28:05] but his feast doesn't hold out. That
[1:28:07] what you'll find is the theme throughout
[1:28:09] this.
[1:28:11] He went on to say many people go to the
[1:28:14] service such as we have this morning.
[1:28:18] They rejoice.
[1:28:20] They shout. We're talking about the
[1:28:21] outer court now.
[1:28:23] Shouting's fine in the outer court. Hey,
[1:28:26] in the outer court, you say, "Well, oh
[1:28:29] my, I just feel it." That's fine. Shout.
[1:28:35] Make sure that when the feeling's gone,
[1:28:37] something's still anchored there. And if
[1:28:40] you find, well, you know what? I
[1:28:41] shouted, "I had such a wonderful time.
[1:28:43] Oh, I had such a marvelous feeling. I
[1:28:46] don't even know where it went."
[1:28:48] So, what shall I do, brother Ed? Pack
[1:28:50] up. Get ready to move.
[1:28:53] &gt;&gt; Make a decision.
[1:28:57] &gt;&gt; Don't be in love with your old self.
[1:29:01] &gt;&gt; Say, "I don't like my old self. I'm
[1:29:03] moving to another place."
[1:29:12] Says they have they shout and they
[1:29:14] praise the Lord. And while the spirit of
[1:29:16] God is falling, all condemnation left
[1:29:20] their hearts.
[1:29:21] And a day or two after the revival, they
[1:29:24] find themselves back in the old grind
[1:29:27] again. They're eating mana.
[1:29:31] He said, "The justified man out here out
[1:29:34] in the outer court, the man's justified.
[1:29:36] He walks by daylight." I touched on this
[1:29:39] last Sunday, but now I want to enlarge
[1:29:41] on it. He walks by daylight.
[1:29:46] I have to make a confession. And I
[1:29:47] actually have I've wondered, you know,
[1:29:49] if the Lord is I don't want to grieve
[1:29:52] the Lord. I don't want to displease the
[1:29:54] Lord, but I have complained more this
[1:29:57] winter than I have at any time of 37
[1:30:01] years of living here in this area. Not
[1:30:04] again.
[1:30:06] I don't have to live in this pea soup
[1:30:08] again. I can't even see the hills. I
[1:30:12] can't even see across the valley. I just
[1:30:15] this dismal drizzle. Why doesn't it go
[1:30:19] back where it came from? And I know that
[1:30:22] there's a sun up there and I just so
[1:30:25] want to see it.
[1:30:30] Do I have any friends?
[1:30:37] And when the sun is out, I don't care.
[1:30:40] You know, maybe it doesn't affect you,
[1:30:41] but when the sun is out and I see the
[1:30:44] early in the morning, the sun hitting
[1:30:46] the trees, I feel better already.
[1:30:50] But should I feel more spiritual? No, I
[1:30:53] shouldn't. But somehow it affects me.
[1:30:55] And so I I realize right away, I better
[1:30:58] pass through this outer court real
[1:31:00] quick. I better not stay here because
[1:31:02] this is going to really bother me.
[1:31:08] I think all of you folks are human
[1:31:09] enough to say I I've been there.
[1:31:12] &gt;&gt; Yeah, I've been there. But you know, and
[1:31:16] that's exactly I feel so sorry for
[1:31:19] people from Arizona and people that have
[1:31:23] come from Florida and people that have
[1:31:25] come from South Africa
[1:31:29] where the first time I ever really heard
[1:31:31] about South Africa, I was on my way
[1:31:33] there and I stepped into a travel agency
[1:31:36] in in Switzerland to catch a buy a
[1:31:39] ticket for South Africa and my wife, my
[1:31:41] family there. And I step in, here's a
[1:31:44] little calendar, just a little we
[1:31:46] calendar. And I looked at that calendar
[1:31:48] and on the bottom it was printed there
[1:31:51] so it could never change. It's sunny
[1:31:53] today in South Africa.
[1:31:57] I never forgot that.
[1:32:00] &gt;&gt; It's as real as it's as real as I'm
[1:32:02] looking at it right now. And I said
[1:32:04] within myself, that's a bold statement.
[1:32:07] They're very certain of their weather.
[1:32:09] It's sunny today in South Africa. And uh
[1:32:12] I can say I have found it cloudy and
[1:32:15] cold too. But nevertheless,
[1:32:18] and I say to myself, is it all right?
[1:32:21] We're just a family here this morning. I
[1:32:22] say, why do people move here? Why do you
[1:32:25] come here? I just stay where it's sunny.
[1:32:29] But you know what?
[1:32:32] I'm not God.
[1:32:34] I'm not a prophet nor a son of a
[1:32:36] prophet.
[1:32:37] But when I sees, you know, God put
[1:32:40] something in somebody's heart, I don't
[1:32:42] know what why he's moving them and
[1:32:44] shifting them around. I don't know. I
[1:32:46] just leave that up to him. But I know
[1:32:48] one thing, the outer court and whether
[1:32:51] the sun is shining and the prophet
[1:32:53] saying we're we're, you know, out there,
[1:32:55] if the sun was shining, you're feeling
[1:32:57] good. And if it's not shining, you're
[1:32:59] not feeling good. But that that isn't
[1:33:01] where we dwell.
[1:33:03] &gt;&gt; That's not where we live. And that's not
[1:33:05] the the message came to provide us. He
[1:33:08] didn't come to provide us with an
[1:33:09] environment that's dictated to by, you
[1:33:12] know, our exterior environment.
[1:33:18] &gt;&gt; You folks might as well say amen.
[1:33:20] &gt;&gt; This is absolutely the message.
[1:33:23] &gt;&gt; And I'm not talking just about the
[1:33:25] weather. I'm talking about our our
[1:33:27] circumstances and the environment around
[1:33:29] us.
[1:33:31] We have to know. He said he walks by
[1:33:33] daylight. Someday has gloomy days. Some
[1:33:38] days you do not know whether it's really
[1:33:41] worthwhile to serve God or not. You're
[1:33:45] walking in the outer court. So you're
[1:33:47] eating mana. Sure.
[1:33:50] You're a believer. Sure. You have
[1:33:53] eternal life. Sure.
[1:33:57] And if you die, you go to heaven.
[1:34:00] But what kind of life are you living?
[1:34:05] Every day you get out there. Oh, I got
[1:34:08] my dandruff up today. Maybe you don't
[1:34:10] know that terminology, but that was
[1:34:12] been, you know, got really, you know,
[1:34:14] upset.
[1:34:16] I told them about it. I cussed them out.
[1:34:20] I couldn't help it. God forgive me. Sure
[1:34:23] he will. Certainly he will. You're his
[1:34:26] child. But what kind of life you living?
[1:34:30] &gt;&gt; Comes to it the second time. He says,
[1:34:33] "My don't you hate to live that kind of
[1:34:35] life?"
[1:34:37] I'm talking to somebody here says, "I
[1:34:39] hate that kind of life. I'm up, I'm
[1:34:41] down, uh, you know, the flesh gets the
[1:34:44] best of me." He says and he says in the
[1:34:47] trouble and that you pull day and night
[1:34:51] backsliding back to church backsliden
[1:34:54] back to church this that apologizing to
[1:34:57] this over here this fell's just blooming
[1:34:59] all right along you see saying I'm in
[1:35:03] and I'm out he just says I'm up and down
[1:35:06] I I'm backsliden no I'm in victory I'm
[1:35:08] backsliden no I'm in victory I I see
[1:35:11] people like that I'm here to tell you
[1:35:13] today I'm your hand. I'm here to tell
[1:35:16] you today, you don't have to have that.
[1:35:18] &gt;&gt; I'm here to tell you today, isn't that
[1:35:20] good news?
[1:35:21] &gt;&gt; Isn't that good news for somebody here?
[1:35:24] You don't have to be on the bottom.
[1:35:27] &gt;&gt; You can feel on the bottom, but you
[1:35:29] don't have to be there. You're not
[1:35:31] ordained to live there
[1:35:34] &gt;&gt; out of fellowship, into fellowship.
[1:35:36] You're not ordained for that. You're not
[1:35:38] made for that.
[1:35:40] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:35:41] &gt;&gt; You're not made for defeat.
[1:35:48] Some say
[1:35:50] I've heard the odd criticism against our
[1:35:52] ministry here. They say it's too
[1:35:54] positive. Let me just tell you, plus all
[1:35:57] the critics that might say that we're
[1:35:59] not nearly as positive as the prophet
[1:36:02] said we should be
[1:36:04] because I have all kinds of negative
[1:36:05] things come by my way and I spend too
[1:36:08] much time on it because it, you know, it
[1:36:10] bothers you and it troubles you and so
[1:36:11] on. get burdened and you've got to stop
[1:36:13] it when it's just a burden on your heart
[1:36:15] and don't let it uh occupy your mind and
[1:36:18] start affecting your life because I
[1:36:20] don't like that kind of life and he says
[1:36:23] what kind of life you living I want to
[1:36:25] live when he talks about just steady all
[1:36:27] the time blooming all the time victory
[1:36:30] all the time love all the time that's
[1:36:32] what he said and that's what I say is a
[1:36:35] positive message I'm going to make that
[1:36:37] confession you need to make that
[1:36:39] confession that life is my life. That's
[1:36:42] what God purposed for me.
[1:36:46] &gt;&gt; All right.
[1:36:48] That's the outer court. And that's the
[1:36:51] if the description fits, you should make
[1:36:54] a clear-cut decision
[1:36:56] to move.
[1:37:00] I don't care whether you move here or
[1:37:02] where you move physically. That's
[1:37:03] irrelevant. Now I just want to go for a
[1:37:06] short moment to the to the next to the
[1:37:09] next place and that is probably should
[1:37:13] have spent a little more time on it but
[1:37:16] the that spirit realm or in the
[1:37:18] tabernacle was the holy place and then
[1:37:22] brother Brandham says well he comes into
[1:37:24] the court now what's in there
[1:37:28] there's seven golden candlesticks
[1:37:31] and by by that holy place and it's
[1:37:34] giving light. So now he's he said it's a
[1:37:38] better light.
[1:37:40] The candlesticks are giving light. And
[1:37:43] that's to the man. He quits his
[1:37:45] drinking, quits his smoking, quits
[1:37:48] lying, quits stealing, treats his
[1:37:52] neighbor right, good to his wife or her,
[1:37:56] good to her husband. In the same way, a
[1:38:00] man or a woman, the believer, he comes
[1:38:03] into a place where he's quit all his
[1:38:06] meanness, which is through the blood of
[1:38:09] sanctification.
[1:38:11] He's called to a new life, and he walks
[1:38:14] in there. See, he's moved. He's walked
[1:38:17] in there.
[1:38:19] He doesn't have to walk by the light out
[1:38:21] there. Whether the sun is shining,
[1:38:24] whether it's gloomy, whether whether
[1:38:26] whether he just lost his job or got
[1:38:28] fired or all the environment or whatever
[1:38:29] is happening in school, whether you
[1:38:31] passed with A's or you barely got
[1:38:33] through with the skin your teeth or
[1:38:34] whatever happened out there, that's
[1:38:36] irrelevant to this man because he's not
[1:38:39] he's he's got another light. He doesn't
[1:38:41] have to walk by the light out there.
[1:38:43] He's got a better light. He's walking by
[1:38:46] the light of the seven golden
[1:38:48] candlesticks, which is burning olive
[1:38:50] oil. And the olive oil was representing
[1:38:53] the Holy Spirit. The fire was the
[1:38:55] baptism which brought baptizing. So now
[1:38:59] this man is moved. And you know a lot of
[1:39:01] people in the message just want to stay
[1:39:02] there. That's all they want to say. Are
[1:39:04] you baptized with the Holy Ghost? Are
[1:39:06] you baptized with the Holy Ghost? Let me
[1:39:07] tell you something. You're not into the
[1:39:09] You're not into the next department yet.
[1:39:11] You're not into the Holy of Holies yet.
[1:39:13] You can have the gift of the baptism of
[1:39:15] the Holy Spirit, but remember still just
[1:39:17] a gift. Brother Brandham said to me, he
[1:39:19] said, "This," took a pen out of his
[1:39:21] pocket. He said, "This is a gift of the
[1:39:23] Holy Ghost, but this is not the Holy
[1:39:26] Ghost, the very person of the Holy
[1:39:28] Ghost." Can I say it again? Something
[1:39:30] that you all know well. Justification
[1:39:34] made way for sanctification.
[1:39:36] Sanctification made way for the baptism
[1:39:39] of the Holy Ghost. And the baptism of
[1:39:42] the Holy Ghost made way for the Holy
[1:39:44] Ghost himself, the person of God himself
[1:39:48] coming and dwelling in your being.
[1:39:52] &gt;&gt; And so now this person has a better
[1:39:54] light
[1:39:57] brought into baptizing or even baptized
[1:39:59] right in there by the Holy Spirit. But
[1:40:02] you're not hid away yet. You're not
[1:40:07] behind the veil. So if anyone comes to
[1:40:11] you and even during this convention to
[1:40:12] come and and that's that's as far as I
[1:40:15] said, oh you need to be baptized with
[1:40:16] the Holy Spirit. I find people use that
[1:40:20] to destabilize people. I'm telling you
[1:40:23] I'm giving you some sound instruction.
[1:40:26] Some some people are are rather forward
[1:40:28] and maybe intimidating say you think you
[1:40:31] have the Holy Ghost. Someone says that
[1:40:33] to you, you let check down your heart,
[1:40:36] look up right in their eye and their
[1:40:38] face and say, "I certainly do.
[1:40:42] &gt;&gt; What do you got?"
[1:40:44] &gt;&gt; Because often people will use that
[1:40:47] tactic to destabilize a person. Say,
[1:40:50] "Well, uh uh" say, "I got something for
[1:40:52] you. I got a special doctrine. I got a
[1:40:55] special revelation. And all you need is
[1:40:57] this."
[1:41:00] &gt;&gt; You know what I'm talking about.
[1:41:03] You want to know where you stand and
[1:41:05] know what you have and don't be ashamed
[1:41:07] of it and say, "I certainly do. I've
[1:41:09] been birthed by this word and it's been
[1:41:12] I've been birthed by the word and by the
[1:41:14] spirit."
[1:41:15] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:41:18] &gt;&gt; Quickly now,
[1:41:21] but he says even in here, here's the
[1:41:23] problem with this place. But there's
[1:41:26] days when those lights get dull.
[1:41:29] There's days when the lamps smoke and
[1:41:32] the lights not so good. There's time
[1:41:35] when those lights have to be relit
[1:41:38] again.
[1:41:40] And you have to borrow a little from a
[1:41:42] neighbor
[1:41:43] to light one candle to the other. It's
[1:41:47] still not a good light. We're thankful
[1:41:49] for it, but it's still not the right
[1:41:53] light.
[1:41:56] I'd like to say this to conclude these
[1:41:58] two courts.
[1:42:00] In these two courts, the outer court and
[1:42:04] the inner court, these are two places
[1:42:08] where the battle really rages in the
[1:42:10] mind because the mind has not come.
[1:42:15] The the the
[1:42:17] channels of the spirit are still very
[1:42:20] active.
[1:42:22] I hope I can get this across to you.
[1:42:26] the memory and the imagination
[1:42:29] and the conscience and the reasoning and
[1:42:33] the affection. Well, the affection can
[1:42:37] do serious damage.
[1:42:39] And all of those five channels,
[1:42:43] I want to say to this congregation
[1:42:45] without any apology,
[1:42:47] every one of us are afflicted in those
[1:42:51] channels if we allow Satan. Now, he will
[1:42:55] use every opportunity that he possibly
[1:42:59] can. He will use every device. He'll use
[1:43:02] every circumstance
[1:43:04] to get into one of those channels and
[1:43:06] begin to cause you distress. and to
[1:43:10] occupy your thoughts and to keep you
[1:43:12] captivated by it. The prophet said the
[1:43:16] Holy Spirit needs to blow those channels
[1:43:19] out.
[1:43:20] &gt;&gt; And you know, when he says it that way,
[1:43:22] I I gather from that that he's not
[1:43:24] saying it in a very a delicate way. He's
[1:43:28] not saying that, you know, we just need
[1:43:30] to have a new flow and we just need to
[1:43:32] have something nice happen. He's saying
[1:43:35] the Holy Spirit needs to blow those
[1:43:38] channels out. We need a blast from God.
[1:43:43] &gt;&gt; He tries to He tries to cabbage down.
[1:43:46] &gt;&gt; He tries to get his roots down and he
[1:43:49] needs to be removed.
[1:43:52] &gt;&gt; He doesn't go simply.
[1:43:54] &gt;&gt; He doesn't go just, you know, by
[1:43:56] invitation. He has to be driven out.
[1:44:01] &gt;&gt; I hope this means something to you.
[1:44:04] Now the prophet said that this battle
[1:44:07] which was in heaven and you know this so
[1:44:09] well. It's it's from the greatest battle
[1:44:11] ever fought. This battle which was
[1:44:13] between the angels in heaven and Satan
[1:44:16] was cast out to the earth. He said when
[1:44:18] this great battle started on earth there
[1:44:21] had to be a mutual
[1:44:24] place meeting place. There had to be a
[1:44:27] place selected for the battle to begin.
[1:44:32] And this word, I don't want you to
[1:44:34] forget it. And for this battle to rage,
[1:44:39] for this battle to rage. And that
[1:44:42] battlegrounds began in the human mind.
[1:44:47] Your mind is a mutual battle ground
[1:44:52] that's been selected and both and Satan
[1:44:55] has a right there to that ground and the
[1:44:59] warfare will take place in that ground.
[1:45:01] And I say that that really rages in the
[1:45:05] outer court and in the inner court.
[1:45:08] Those two courts is where this battle
[1:45:10] really rages. You say, "Well, what is
[1:45:12] the answer?" I'm going to dwell on it
[1:45:15] now for just the next till I close. When
[1:45:18] you move on, if you're in that place and
[1:45:21] the mind has been engaged in a raging
[1:45:24] battle this way and that way and
[1:45:27] reasoning this and thinking that,
[1:45:29] Brother Ed is telling you today, you
[1:45:32] need to pack up your bags. And in this
[1:45:35] case, I say leave your bags behind.
[1:45:38] &gt;&gt; You need to make a clear-cut decision.
[1:45:41] &gt;&gt; I am moving.
[1:45:44] I am not going to live there any longer.
[1:45:49] &gt;&gt; Listen folks, I'm not preaching a
[1:45:50] sermon. I am giving instruction which I
[1:45:54] believe is from the Holy Spirit. People
[1:45:57] in this congregation, you need to say,
[1:45:59] "I am moving from that place. I've had a
[1:46:03] mental warfare on." And you might say,
[1:46:06] "Well, just because I go to the Holy of
[1:46:08] Holies, does do I do I lose my mind? Do
[1:46:11] I do I lose my thinking capacity? No.
[1:46:14] But in the Holy of Holies, you become so
[1:46:17] absorbed, so penetrated because there's
[1:46:21] a presence there that the Holy Spirit in
[1:46:24] that presence that Satan cannot live in
[1:46:28] that presence.
[1:46:31] &gt;&gt; He cannot live in that presence. He
[1:46:34] doesn't have a right to that presence.
[1:46:41] I'm going to go to the one.
[1:46:52] And I've called this service this
[1:46:55] morning entering into his rest.
[1:47:00] And now we come to the inner rest, the
[1:47:02] holiest of all.
[1:47:05] It's a real place.
[1:47:08] And this is what Paul's whole subject's
[1:47:10] about. He said they couldn't enter in
[1:47:13] because of unbelief. If you have
[1:47:16] believed or attempted to believe in this
[1:47:19] service at any moment, this is the
[1:47:21] moment now you need to really come to
[1:47:24] grips and saying, "Oh God, send your
[1:47:27] Holy Spirit and let me become so
[1:47:29] sensitized that I will grasp now every
[1:47:33] word. This is where I need to move into
[1:47:36] the pastor saying this is the purpose of
[1:47:38] this service. And it is it is shake off.
[1:47:44] See, I can sense that even now Satan
[1:47:48] wants to, you know, uh kind of make make
[1:47:53] our minds kind of dull and so on and so
[1:47:55] forth. You shake that off.
[1:47:57] &gt;&gt; You resist him now.
[1:47:59] &gt;&gt; Say, "I came here for this purpose. I
[1:48:01] came here to do business with God. I'm
[1:48:03] not going to allow this spirit to affect
[1:48:06] me at all. I don't care where it comes
[1:48:08] from. I'm not going to allow it. I'm not
[1:48:10] going to allow it. If you sense it
[1:48:12] beside you, say in within yourself, I
[1:48:14] resist that
[1:48:15] &gt;&gt; in the name of Jesus Christ. I have
[1:48:17] conquering power within me over that.
[1:48:20] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:48:28] &gt;&gt; Here's the inner rest.
[1:48:30] Here's the person. Here's the prophet's
[1:48:32] description of the inner rest.
[1:48:35] Is not tossed about.
[1:48:39] Does not run from place to place.
[1:48:43] Doesn't fuss and fume
[1:48:46] and worry about things.
[1:48:51] Says sickness may come,
[1:48:55] disappointments may come.
[1:48:58] There isn't a person here.
[1:49:00] That's us, friends.
[1:49:02] &gt;&gt; There isn't a person here that hasn't
[1:49:05] had disappointments,
[1:49:07] hasn't had sicknesses come.
[1:49:10] And this man, this woman that's in there
[1:49:13] has had all of these things. They don't
[1:49:15] fuss. They don't fume.
[1:49:19] They don't worry about things.
[1:49:22] And he says this. Now I'm coming to the
[1:49:25] real crux of my message this morning.
[1:49:27] The thing that's really burning on my
[1:49:28] heart and I'm determined before God that
[1:49:31] this is going to be conveyed to you and
[1:49:33] it'll be off my hands and the Holy
[1:49:35] Spirit's going to bring it to your mind.
[1:49:42] He says, "But the Christian's at rest."
[1:49:46] He keeps saying that the Christian is at
[1:49:48] rest. It's the rest that Paul is
[1:49:51] speaking about. There remainth that some
[1:49:54] must enter into this rest. It's for us.
[1:49:58] &gt;&gt; I identify. I say, Apostle Paul, you're
[1:50:01] prophesying about me
[1:50:04] &gt;&gt; in this day of distress, in this day of
[1:50:07] violence, in this days of inequities,
[1:50:11] in this day when we travel around the
[1:50:14] world. I tell you what, you know, I I
[1:50:16] got distressed. I had some distress, not
[1:50:20] the kind that I'm just preaching about,
[1:50:21] but I had some distress within my heart
[1:50:24] while in Usuzbekistan.
[1:50:28] People earn $30 a month. An average
[1:50:32] salary is $70 a month. Average salary, a
[1:50:37] very well-paid person is $150 a month.
[1:50:41] And before I left, before I went there,
[1:50:45] I just felt in my heart, I I w would
[1:50:49] like to do something.
[1:50:51] The poor have always been on my heart.
[1:50:55] And I see children and I see them in
[1:50:58] slums and say, I want to do something
[1:51:01] for them.
[1:51:04] You know, it's it's not easy.
[1:51:08] I said to a minister, I said to a
[1:51:10] pastor, and I just related the other
[1:51:11] day. I I said to a pastor, we were
[1:51:13] traveling on an airplane, sitting beside
[1:51:16] me, a good pastor, this message. I call
[1:51:18] him by his name because he's a good
[1:51:20] friend.
[1:51:22] I said, I'm going to ask you a question.
[1:51:24] And I don't want you to answer me too
[1:51:26] soon. I want you to really think this
[1:51:29] out, and when you're done, I'd like your
[1:51:32] answer.
[1:51:34] right now. Here's a million dollars
[1:51:36] cash.
[1:51:38] I'm putting it in your hands.
[1:51:41] You have a million dollars cash
[1:51:44] for the gospel, for the message. You
[1:51:48] have a million dollars cash. I want you
[1:51:52] to tell me what you're going to do with
[1:51:54] that.
[1:52:01] He thought.
[1:52:03] And he thought
[1:52:06] and he thought some more.
[1:52:09] He finally said, "I don't know.
[1:52:13] I don't know what to do with it."
[1:52:16] I said, "That's a dilemma, isn't it?"
[1:52:18] You know something, friends? I have
[1:52:20] actually looked for people that would be
[1:52:24] real trustworthy
[1:52:27] men that could make sound decisions
[1:52:30] outside of their own environment,
[1:52:32] outside of themselves
[1:52:34] to help these people.
[1:52:37] And I did see a man. I found a man.
[1:52:41] A man who's had a hard time. A man who's
[1:52:43] lived a hard life. A man who's who Satan
[1:52:47] has almost destroyed him. Now he's
[1:52:49] married and he's got one or two little
[1:52:52] children. And I I've I've determined in
[1:52:55] my heart I'm going to help that man.
[1:52:58] He's living with two other families in a
[1:53:01] small apartment.
[1:53:04] But you know when you want to do good,
[1:53:06] the scripture says evil is present with
[1:53:09] you. When I would do good, evil is
[1:53:12] present with you. It's not easy to even
[1:53:15] determine I'm going to make a move. I'm
[1:53:18] going to be decisive. I'm going to make
[1:53:20] a move. And if some of you here got a
[1:53:22] whole lot better advice and a lot better
[1:53:25] counsel, I'd be happy to talk to you. I
[1:53:27] say that with all sincerity.
[1:53:30] And this congregation
[1:53:32] based on
[1:53:34] a a main thrust. We want to help people.
[1:53:37] This message is a blessed blessed thing.
[1:53:40] But getting it out to people is not a
[1:53:42] simple thing. It's not a simple matter.
[1:53:45] But I will not be deterred
[1:53:48] &gt;&gt; from getting something that fed my soul
[1:53:51] to someone else that to feed their soul.
[1:53:54] Oh, they say, "Well, they speak another
[1:53:56] language and I won't let that hinder
[1:53:58] me."
[1:53:58] &gt;&gt; You We won't let that hinder us. We'll
[1:54:01] get it to them some way somehow.
[1:54:07] &gt;&gt; Are you with me? And I appreciate people
[1:54:10] that we're going to live this life and
[1:54:12] and do whatever we can. So these people
[1:54:16] and now he says, and I I've got to get
[1:54:18] to this. Just give me about 10 more
[1:54:20] minutes. I'm going to close. He said,
[1:54:21] "But the Christians at rest knowing this
[1:54:25] that God God's able to keep that which
[1:54:28] he has performed, knowing that no matter
[1:54:32] what the thing is or how it looks,
[1:54:34] there's neither sickness, sorrow. Let me
[1:54:38] start with that and let let you say
[1:54:39] amen. There's neither sickness, sorrow,
[1:54:43] death. There's neither starvation or
[1:54:46] anything that can separate us from the
[1:54:49] love of God that's in Jesus Christ.
[1:54:51] There's nothing. And that's why that
[1:54:54] person who's in there, now get this.
[1:54:57] Here it is. Moving from the outer court,
[1:55:02] he the weather's this, my job is this,
[1:55:05] my marks is this. So, and and and we're
[1:55:08] affected by that. Move into the other
[1:55:10] place, we got a better light. Oh, I feel
[1:55:12] the Holy Spirit and and and but then it
[1:55:15] kind of, you know, the flame goes out
[1:55:17] and and it smokes up and and uh we find
[1:55:22] out that that's not a perfect light. And
[1:55:24] then we find that there's another place
[1:55:27] the difference between the outer court
[1:55:29] and the inner court. There is a
[1:55:32] knowledge. It's called a knowing.
[1:55:36] When a person gets into that in and you
[1:55:38] get into that presence.
[1:55:42] You know something
[1:55:45] that you couldn't know out there and out
[1:55:49] there. There's a a special knowing.
[1:55:54] Those of you that are married,
[1:55:58] you try to tell someone who's unmarried
[1:56:01] what it's all about.
[1:56:05] can't really do it. See, the only way to
[1:56:07] know, the only way you can really know
[1:56:10] is you get married and you'll know. You
[1:56:13] never have children, don't have
[1:56:15] children, don't have children,
[1:56:19] you can never really know what it is
[1:56:22] till you have them. And when that
[1:56:24] mother's gone through child birth and
[1:56:27] holds that baby and the father is there
[1:56:30] and then they bring up that child, you
[1:56:32] see it grow up her life, try to explain
[1:56:34] that. Try to give a scientific formula.
[1:56:38] There is no formula until you've done
[1:56:40] it. And there is no special formula that
[1:56:43] I can give you what it's like to be in
[1:56:46] that place. But I can tell you, you'll
[1:56:49] know something when you come in the
[1:56:51] presence of the Almighty God that you'll
[1:56:54] never know anywhere else. And there's a
[1:56:56] knowing. And that's why the Apostle John
[1:57:00] could say, "We know
[1:57:02] &gt;&gt; that we are of God."
[1:57:04] &gt;&gt; How did he know that? He'd been in that
[1:57:06] place.
[1:57:07] &gt;&gt; We know we're born of God. How could he
[1:57:10] say that? He'd been in that presence.
[1:57:20] No wonder the apostle
[1:57:23] could say,
[1:57:26] "For the which cause, Apostle Paul, I
[1:57:30] also suffer these things. Nevertheless,
[1:57:33] I'm not ashamed, for I know whom I have
[1:57:35] believed, and I'm persuaded that he's
[1:57:37] able to keep that which I've committed
[1:57:38] unto him against that day, knowing, and
[1:57:41] the Apostle John said, but we know by
[1:57:44] this we know that we are the children of
[1:57:46] God. And he said, and if we know that he
[1:57:50] hear us whatsoever we ask, we know that
[1:57:52] we have the petition wherever we desired
[1:57:54] of him. He said again 5:18, we know that
[1:57:58] whatsoever whosoever is born of God
[1:58:00] sinnth not. 1 John 5:19, "And we know
[1:58:03] that we are of God, and the whole world
[1:58:06] lith in wickedness." 1 John 5:20, "And
[1:58:09] we know that the Son of God has come and
[1:58:11] hath given us an understanding that we
[1:58:14] may know him that is true."
[1:58:19] The prophet said, "The veil
[1:58:22] drop behind you,
[1:58:24] the noise of the world."
[1:58:27] And when the veil drops behind you and
[1:58:30] you experience this special place,
[1:58:34] I'm speaking to every person here.
[1:58:38] All the voices
[1:58:40] you're alone with God and all the
[1:58:43] voices, the voices of your friends, the
[1:58:46] voices of your family.
[1:58:50] We hear voices every day. And some of
[1:58:52] them
[1:58:54] we need that filter of the veil.
[1:58:58] Some of them we shouldn't
[1:59:00] shouldn't hit our ears and our senses.
[1:59:06] You'll have to be the judge
[1:59:08] quickly.
[1:59:10] How do I move into this hidden place?
[1:59:13] How do I move? I really wrestle with
[1:59:16] this because I wanted to bring it to you
[1:59:18] before I close.
[1:59:21] How do I move into this hidden place?
[1:59:23] You say, "Brother Brandham, we've got a
[1:59:26] picture here under consideration,
[1:59:28] but how do you get to it?
[1:59:31] What's the next thing? How do we get in
[1:59:34] there?"
[1:59:37] Here's the way you come in
[1:59:40] the pattern.
[1:59:42] Anything that was dead
[1:59:45] lived when it came in that presence.
[1:59:48] Took Aaron's rod.
[1:59:50] And the prophet said, and notice when
[1:59:53] they put Aaron's rod in there, it
[1:59:56] budded,
[1:59:58] blossomed, and bore fruit.
[2:00:01] That's the whole cycle of life.
[2:00:04] Regardless of what state you're in or
[2:00:06] where you're at or what position you're
[2:00:08] at, you move into that place, regardless
[2:00:11] of how dead you may feel, how untouched
[2:00:15] you may feel, how unconscious you might
[2:00:18] feel to God this morning. I have news
[2:00:21] for you. I'm inviting you. The Holy
[2:00:24] Spirit's inviting you. You move into
[2:00:26] that place. And the prophet said, "You
[2:00:30] are a stick. Every man, woman, child
[2:00:33] here is a stick of some kind. And you're
[2:00:36] taken off the branch of humanity which
[2:00:39] God has created.
[2:00:41] God created his son in the beginning.
[2:00:44] You may be fallen.
[2:00:46] You may be dead. You may be alienated
[2:00:50] from God.
[2:00:52] But by that in creation, you were
[2:00:55] created a son of God.
[2:00:58] You may bounce around
[2:01:01] and be respected and honored out there
[2:01:03] in the in the courts. Out here, you may
[2:01:06] bounce around, he says, and be
[2:01:08] respected, but if you ever get into the
[2:01:10] glorious place and hit away with God,
[2:01:13] you'll yield to what you're supposed to
[2:01:16] do. So you take a dead sinner alienated
[2:01:20] from God, without hope, without Christ,
[2:01:23] and put him in that presence in this
[2:01:25] great, glorious tabernacle in there, he
[2:01:28] will yield fruit of the Holy Spirit,
[2:01:30] love, joy, peace, longsuffering.
[2:01:33] He'll yield those.
[2:01:36] He says we come in,
[2:01:39] and here's how we come in. Number one,
[2:01:42] by refreshing yourself
[2:01:45] in a quiet time.
[2:01:47] with God.
[2:01:50] This life is very busy.
[2:01:53] I don't have to tell you
[2:01:56] your life's busy. My life's busy.
[2:02:00] But the times that God is most near to
[2:02:03] me is when I get alone. Alone.
[2:02:08] Not with my wife in a car.
[2:02:12] Not out where I'm seeing all kinds of
[2:02:14] people. I get alone. all alone
[2:02:18] and begin to talk to him and tell him
[2:02:22] just exactly
[2:02:24] what do you say, brother Ed?
[2:02:27] Well, sometimes I feel like a I feel
[2:02:29] like a a dead post.
[2:02:32] You feel like that sometime? Yeah, I
[2:02:33] feel like that. So, what do you say to
[2:02:36] him? Well, I get down.
[2:02:41] Lord,
[2:02:46] I just feel like a stick of wood.
[2:02:48] I feel like a I feel like a fence post.
[2:02:51] I feel like a telephone pole. I don't
[2:02:54] feel anything.
[2:02:56] I know that you're real.
[2:03:01] And I start thinking now
[2:03:05] about the various
[2:03:08] little places that he met me.
[2:03:11] And I begin to rehearse those. I
[2:03:13] remember back there it was a real
[2:03:16] difficult time,
[2:03:19] but I know it was you. I know it was
[2:03:22] you. I'd never made it on my own. I know
[2:03:25] that you met me back there. And then
[2:03:28] there was another time later in my life.
[2:03:31] And I knew that was you. I knew it was
[2:03:34] you. Nothing could do that but you.
[2:03:38] There was a time when it seemed that all
[2:03:41] hell came against me ready to tear
[2:03:45] everything up.
[2:03:47] But you gave me a word.
[2:03:50] You know something, friends?
[2:03:52] You don't do that very long.
[2:03:55] You start telling him and thanking him
[2:03:59] and his presence will just come and
[2:04:02] surround you, begin to move through you
[2:04:04] and permeate you and you enter into a
[2:04:07] relationship.
[2:04:09] Are things any different outside? No,
[2:04:11] not necessarily. But they're different
[2:04:14] inside. And you have a new found
[2:04:17] strength. You have a new found that
[2:04:19] relationship invalidates what the
[2:04:22] weather is and what the job is and what
[2:04:24] the finances are and what's happening in
[2:04:26] the church and what's happening in this
[2:04:28] person or that person. We have great
[2:04:30] burdens but that presence invalidates
[2:04:32] it. It overcomes it. It gives you
[2:04:35] strength beyond that.
[2:04:39] &gt;&gt; And with this I close.
[2:04:46] Brother Brandham told a story.
[2:04:50] He told it 38 times.
[2:05:18] story is about, you all know it well,
[2:05:21] but I saw something I've never seen in
[2:05:23] all my years.
[2:05:27] the stories of the slave broker
[2:05:34] that was buying slaves.
[2:05:39] And he came
[2:05:41] to this trader
[2:05:45] and he sees a young man
[2:05:48] that is very, very different than the
[2:05:51] others.
[2:05:54] And brother Brandham says
[2:06:00] slave broker said I'll take him.
[2:06:04] No, he said he's not for sale.
[2:06:08] He said but he's so different.
[2:06:11] He's so different from all the others.
[2:06:16] What makes him different?
[2:06:19] He said, "Do you feed him different?"
[2:06:21] No. He said, "Eats the day. eats the
[2:06:23] same mana.
[2:06:26] The man in the outer court eats the same
[2:06:27] mana. The man in the inner court eats
[2:06:29] the same mana as the man who's in the
[2:06:30] holy place. They all eat the same mana.
[2:06:32] Says he eats the same food. Eats in the
[2:06:35] galley.
[2:06:36] Do you do you treat him different? Do
[2:06:38] you treat them better? No. The man in
[2:06:41] the holy place, he has troubles. And the
[2:06:43] man in the inner court, he has troubles.
[2:06:44] And the man in the outer court, they all
[2:06:45] have their troubles.
[2:06:48] Do they worship in a different place?
[2:06:50] No. They all worship in the same place.
[2:06:53] what makes him so different?
[2:06:57] He said, I often wondered that myself
[2:07:02] to one day I asked him. He told me he
[2:07:05] was a he was a son of a king of a tribe
[2:07:12] in Africa.
[2:07:16] It said, "And he conducts himself in
[2:07:18] such a way." And 10 times out of the 38
[2:07:21] times, 10 times, Brother Brandham makes
[2:07:24] this comment and makes this reference
[2:07:27] that this young man said to his broker.
[2:07:29] And the broker said to him, he he lives
[2:07:31] this way. He acts this way to keep the
[2:07:35] morale of the others up.
[2:07:42] So it isn't only that he had he had a
[2:07:44] knowing
[2:07:46] when you come into a place and somebody
[2:07:49] tried to tell you you haven't met God
[2:07:52] say I'm sorry sir I'm sorry ma'am you
[2:07:55] have no idea what you're talking about I
[2:07:58] know I'm a son of a king I know I'm the
[2:08:05] daughter of a king I happen to know the
[2:08:08] royal seed that I came from. I happen to
[2:08:12] know the family I'm associated with. I
[2:08:17] happen to know the God who has given me
[2:08:21] birth. I have experienced this.
[2:08:24] And he said with that knowing
[2:08:27] he conducted himself in such a way he
[2:08:30] just handled himself differently
[2:08:34] to keep the moral the morale of the
[2:08:37] others up.
[2:08:39] Somebody beside you, somebody in this
[2:08:42] congregation
[2:08:43] isn't having the same knowing that you
[2:08:46] have, but they need to be able to look
[2:08:49] at you and say,
[2:08:53] "That person is so different.
[2:08:57] That brother, that sister, that young
[2:08:59] person is so different.
[2:09:03] I crave to live that kind of life.
[2:09:07] I crave to have that kind of victory.
[2:09:13] And there is a there's a fragrance. The
[2:09:16] prophet said in there you had to be
[2:09:18] anointed with the with the oil of the
[2:09:22] rose of Sharon the fragrance.
[2:09:25] Then he said,
[2:09:27] "Have you ever met anybody
[2:09:30] that's been in there?
[2:09:33] Have you ever met somebody that's been
[2:09:35] in there?
[2:09:38] He said they're like,
[2:09:41] he said they've had a quiet time and
[2:09:44] they're so fragrant and their life is so
[2:09:47] fragrant,
[2:09:49] so at peace.
[2:09:53] He said, "Have you come out in the
[2:09:54] morning, early in the morning,
[2:09:57] and the whole earth has laid quiet at
[2:10:00] night?
[2:10:03] And the dew has fell softly.
[2:10:07] And the fragrance is so sweet. And you
[2:10:10] come out and the whole of creation is so
[2:10:15] peaceful and quiet. And he tied that
[2:10:19] directly to the person that's been in
[2:10:20] there. They come out. He said, "Have you
[2:10:23] ever met one?"
[2:10:25] Tell you what, friends,
[2:10:28] if you haven't experienced that place,
[2:10:32] and maybe you have,
[2:10:35] we we are enticed and we come back out
[2:10:37] and we get all
[2:10:40] filled with anxiety in this world.
[2:10:44] I'm closing now. I'm just saying to you,
[2:10:47] he's waiting.
[2:10:49] He's waiting. He said, I'll meet them in
[2:10:51] there.
[2:10:53] And there's a special place.
[2:10:56] And our Lord,
[2:10:58] our heavenly father, the shakina glory
[2:11:00] that never goes out is longing for that
[2:11:03] moment. And I'm I'm inviting you to move
[2:11:07] into that moment. Take that. You have to
[2:11:09] go in
[2:11:11] quietness
[2:11:14] and you have to go in by invitation.
[2:11:18] I'm not just a preacher here today.
[2:11:22] And God didn't give me this message for
[2:11:25] any other purpose but to end up by his
[2:11:28] words. You are now being invited
[2:11:34] into that holy of holies
[2:11:38] and to dwell there
[2:11:40] to receive all the benefits
[2:11:43] that come from that glorious place.
[2:11:49] Isn't he wonderful? Amen.
[2:11:51] &gt;&gt; Let's bow our heads.
[2:11:55] Our Lord Jesus,
[2:11:58] there's something special about this
[2:12:00] moment.
[2:12:02] We've been speaking of you.
[2:12:05] We have been speaking to the very best
[2:12:08] of our ability to lay it out to the
[2:12:10] people
[2:12:12] how your prophet described inner rest.
[2:12:15] Inner rest.
[2:12:18] the hidden life.
[2:12:21] And oh, we love that hidden life.
[2:12:25] We love that inner rest. We love seeing
[2:12:27] what you're doing.
[2:12:30] We love your moving of your Holy Spirit.
[2:12:33] We love Lord when you take and
[2:12:37] move through the
[2:12:40] aisles of the church into the homes
[2:12:45] into the places where people are now
[2:12:47] streaming. Move in amongst them Lord and
[2:12:52] I pray that you will take us into that
[2:12:55] secret hidden place.
[2:12:59] Lord Jesus,
[2:13:02] some of the people no doubt are just
[2:13:04] unsure of how how to do it. Would you
[2:13:07] take them by the hand? I pray. And those
[2:13:10] that are especially in need, oh God,
[2:13:12] that have lived a very unstable life.
[2:13:15] They don't want to. They're eating the

[2:18:18] Brother Ed,
[2:18:20] two things.
[2:18:22] I've made the decision
[2:18:26] and I'm moving.
[2:18:28] I received the invitation
[2:18:31] and I'm moving into that secret place,
[2:18:34] that special place.
[2:18:37] Listen, friends, Satan's going to do
[2:18:39] everything he can to keep you out of it.
[2:18:41] But you resolve today, I'm moving into
[2:18:44] that sacred place. I'm going to move
[2:18:46] into that special place. I'm moving in
[2:18:49] where he said, I'll meet you there.
[2:18:55] You feel his presence. You sense his
[2:18:57] nearness.
[2:19:00] Amen.
[2:19:01] [Music]
[2:19:05] I want to sing that last verse again if
[2:19:08] you don't mind.
[2:19:11] See, I'm just waiting on him.
[2:19:15] And I want to pray with each one,
[2:19:18] each one that comes to and those
[2:19:21] especially that have a special need. I
[2:19:25] really need
[2:19:27] I need to move. I've lived here too
[2:19:29] long. I need to move. I'm going to pray
[2:19:32] with you and for you now on
[2:19:37] my pathway.
[2:19:41] [Music]

[2:21:04] Raising your hands.
[2:21:06] [Music]
[2:21:08] Lord, we have just sung.
[2:21:11] Shakina unending
[2:21:14] is all we long for.
[2:21:17] That is my personal
[2:21:20] prayer.
[2:21:22] Shakina unending.
[2:21:24] And what I pray, oh God, for myself, I
[2:21:28] pray for each one that is saying to you
[2:21:32] just now from their innermost being.
[2:21:36] Yes, Lord, I'm moving on. I've been too
[2:21:41] long in this place. I've been too long
[2:21:43] affected and afflicted by my
[2:21:47] circumstances and by things around me.
[2:21:51] And I know I know that you had me here
[2:21:54] this morning. I know I know that you
[2:21:58] wanted me and ordained that I should
[2:22:00] hear these words. And oh God, the Holy
[2:22:03] Spirit is now witnessing to my own soul.
[2:22:07] Father, for these individuals, I know
[2:22:09] that there's men and women that are
[2:22:11] saying to you, you've had me here.
[2:22:15] You've caused me to hear these things.
[2:22:17] And your Holy Spirit is witnessing to me
[2:22:20] now that I am moving on. I'm moving on.
[2:22:24] I'm seeking to dwell on the shakina
[2:22:28] glory. Oh God, you intended that for me.
[2:22:33] And Lord, I move away from the from the
[2:22:36] den and the noise of this world, from
[2:22:38] the confusion and the pressure of it. I
[2:22:41] move in, oh God, where I have communion
[2:22:45] with you and fellowship, sweet
[2:22:47] fellowship with you. Help me also to be
[2:22:51] that kind of a believer that builds up
[2:22:54] the morale of those around me. Don't let
[2:22:56] me be don't let me be a a negative
[2:23:00] influence. Let me be a positive
[2:23:01] influence upon them. Let me be one
[2:23:04] filled with the oil of the Holy Spirit.
[2:23:08] Let it run. Let my cup run over. Oh God,
[2:23:11] let the fragrance of the rose of Sharon
[2:23:14] be emitted out, oh Lord, with a strong
[2:23:18] fragrance from my life. Oh God, let my
[2:23:21] words be seasoned with grace. I pray
[2:23:24] this in the name of Jesus Christ. I pray
[2:23:26] for all whose hearts are now raised up
[2:23:29] to you. I commit the words in this
[2:23:32] congregation and the evening service and
[2:23:35] those that will be baptized tonight.
[2:23:38] Father, blessings upon them. Blessings
[2:23:41] upon all who are looking and streaming
[2:23:44] now over the internet. Blessings upon
[2:23:47] them. Touch them body, spirit, and soul.
[2:23:50] I pray in the sweet, lovely name of our
[2:23:53] Lord Jesus Christ.
[2:23:56] Amen and amen.
[2:23:58] Just before we shake hands, I want to
[2:24:01] sing with you. I'm sheltered in the
[2:24:03] hands of God. Let the winds blow. Let
[2:24:07] the storms rage high. I cannot be moved.
[2:24:10] I'm sheltered in that hand. Hallelujah.
[2:24:14] As I look across this congregation, I
[2:24:16] just think of one victory after another,
[2:24:18] friends. Every week, every day, there's
[2:24:20] marvelous victories. Let's glorify him
[2:24:23] now.
[2:24:27] Oh, let the storm
[2:24:33] [Music]
[2:24:41] shelter
[2:24:44] within the

[2:25:24] for
[2:25:28] [Music]
[2:25:36] me
[2:25:38] and God
[2:25:41] can harm me.
[2:25:48] [Music]
[2:25:53] I don't want to hear the voices discard
[2:25:55] us. So let the storms

[2:27:26] Lord. We give him glory. Hallelujah.

[2:27:32] Lord Jesus Christ. Just obey the Lord.
