[Music] Bless your name. &gt;&gt; Blessed be your name, Jesus. &gt;&gt; And we're just going to go to prayer at this time. Sister Kathy would like us to remember the husband of a coworker who's going in for open heart surgery. His name is Wayne. Just pray that the Lord would be with him and use this as an opportunity to speak to his heart. And remember our brother John speaking in Seattle. the Seattle meetings down there. If you have a need you want to take before the Lord, just let it be known with an uplifted hand. And brother Tom, would you actually come and take us before the Lord if you wouldn't mind? Amen. Thank you, brother Tom. Father, the worship has been sweet and we believe the presence of God is amongst your children this morning. So we want to open uh our hearts to you. Speak to us from your word this morning. Lord, as your servant will come, we all desire to walk in heavenly places. The believer's rightful position to sit with the king to dine as his guest. How a privileged these pilgrims are that we can eat off that body word of the son of man. Commune with the king and not only us speak to you but you speak back to us Lord. So may we have receptive hearts this morning as you will speak through your servant. Anoint him anoint us. And may this communion service around the word be sweet and pure and holy as the worship has been. We believe Lord even as the angels are in attendance that they must hold their voices as we will speak of the redemption of God and power of the blood and the bleach of your word and the cleansing power that lays within the token. We're so thankful, Lord, that we have an assembly of believers that can gather together lick of fire upon lick of fire. That Lord, that the Holy Ghost himself could dwell amongst the praise of your people. So let us lift up our voices together and worship the lamb for he is worthy of all glory and honor and praise. Lord, would you meet the needs of your children? Lord, with our hearts filled with faith that we would believe for our request this morning, not only do we ask, but we receive it in the name of Jesus. So, Father, as we now turn the order of the service to the word, may God, we come with open hearts to receive all the promises of God. We love your your servant, our pastor. We pray that you'll anoint the gifts and father god that you will anoint the need the needs and those that have joined with us on the internet on the phone lord may that same presence that is here would it go to them Lord God minister to every soul &gt;&gt; break up the stony heart Lord God and gives us heart of flesh that the word would be pinned &gt;&gt; upon them this morning we ask you now to meet every need in divine presence So we commit now this service to you in Jesus name. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; They all said &gt;&gt; amen. &gt;&gt; Love the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. God bless you. Have your seats please. I'm just going to take this time now to make a couple of announcements. And it's sort of always hard because just love to continue in this channel channel of worship for the word to come and speak to us. God bless you all. We have camp coming up. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; And we're going to our mission field. &gt;&gt; Del Mount Baker Bible Way Camp. &gt;&gt; We're going to missionary to our children. Amen. &gt;&gt; And I want to thank right now every counselor and assistant counselor and those parents that will be on camp for giving your time, your money, and your effort to be there to be able to be a blessing to our children. You have sacrificed. And I believe our God will pour out abundantly upon you for all that you've done for the kingdom of God. And I I know you've heard it over the years. We always say one soul's worth it. But for me, with the family of God that is here and our children, to me, it's worth everything and all the effort that we do. And I want to say God bless you this morning and thank you for making yourselves available. We'll have a meeting this afternoon right after the service in the chapel, a meeting for counselors and assistance counselors who have been contacted. So, we have contacted those that will be taking uh a cabin and uh for junior and senior, we want everybody there that has been contacted. I wish to thank all those that have volunteered to want to be a counselor, an assistant counselor. And my joy is there's always more than than we need. And we try to to move different ones that have been or haven't been and the younger ones and bring them up. So, we've tried to do our best and I want to show my deep appreciation for your support and to thank you that you have um wanted to do something for the Lord and and and I'm so thankful we've got more. I'm not pulling teeth to get you there. So, God bless you for that. We have opened the camp to be a full family camp and we've got those that'll be staying on camp, which is wonderful. And um we have also contacted those that uh have wished to stay on camp and we've placed them. I want to thank Michael and Abigail and Sarah and my wife Joanne for doing this. This is a this is an unbelievable task because we had suggested to our counselors if the husband is counseling, we'd like to help out the sisters to be there with their children and vice versa to make this a full uh family camp. We do have a apparently um a waiting list still of people wanting to come on. So if you've been contacted and and and we've placed you into a place and then plans have changed and you're not going to be there, we don't want um to be surprised. So if you have changed your plans, would you please contact Sister Sarah at the office so we can have those that are on the waiting list come on in. And I I believe that there's still RV spots Sarah still available. So, if anybody uh desires a RV spot, I think there's um uh space there for you. We're looking forward to August. We're looking forward to a great time, junior camp and senior camp. And God bless you. Keep it in your prayers. And um Lord willing, I've talked to brother Ron Spencer. He's he's he's thrilled to be back with us again. And I'm I told him, I said, "Well, I think we're more thrilled than you are." I said, "We're going to work you and we're going to squeeze you." And I know what it is to be squeezed like a lemon. So, I told him, "We're going to squeeze you like a lemon." And um God bless you and remember the camp. Thank you. &gt;&gt; Amen. Thank you, brother Tom. Also want to remember the week at the witnessing booth, the week immediately following camp. Is there still a signup sheet out there? There's still a signup sheet. So, if you're interested and can donate even an evening or one shift, there's three different shifts per day if you just like to sign up and put your name on the list so that we have an idea of how many people are going to be able to make it out. Amen. We don't have any specials this morning. So, we're just going to sing a special all together. Why don't we sing here is love as we prepare for our brother Episcopal to come and bring the word. Amen. Are you hungry? &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. We're eager to hear the word. So, let's just take another moment and continue to worship him. Amen. Oh, here is love fast as the ocean. [Music] The days of [Music] shre. [Music] Heat. Heat. [Music] Heat. Heat. Heat. Heat. Heat. Heat. Heat. [Music] Heat. Heat. [Music] Heat. Heat. Heat. I love [Music] you. [Music] Heat. Heat. [Music] Heat. Heat. [Music] Gra. [Music] [Music] Heat. Heat. Heat. Heat. Yeah. Heat. [Music] [Music] eternity. [Music] [Music] and [Music] perfect. [Music] Yeah. Heat. [Music] Amen. [Music] Eternal [Music] we turn this service to our pastor saying we are standing on holy ground and I know that they're angels. Amen. Oh, and we are standing on holy ground. [Music] Oh, Jesus. [Music] Oh, [Music] heat, [Music] heat. Yeah. Heat. [Music] Jesus, we are standing in his presence. [Music] Amen. Amen. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; You feel like you're standing on a holy ground. It's holy ground because the people get to meet God. &gt;&gt; We haven't come here just to sing. We haven't come here just to preach or to listen to preaching. We've come to meet with God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. To draw closer to him. I have here a note that we are welcoming our uh brother John and sister Lois Okall. I believe it is. They're friends of brother Persal and sister Adah. and they just uh immigrated here from the Philippines. I wonder if they could stand. Amen. We're always welcome. You're welcome in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; We pray that you'll not only receive but also participate and and uh benefit others with your presence. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. God bless you. Uh we we are really happy to hear also what uh Sister Jenny Lelay is doing better. Uh we praise God for that. It was really she was in I would think quite a critical situation. The doctors initially didn't know. I think they gave about 50/50 chance not on life but a 50-50 chance of with their procedure being successful uh with these four aneurisms that were uh feeding blood to her uh her pancreas I believe no her pancreas began to swell after that and so we begin to have some difficulties to her spleen it was and uh so I think many of you received the email Uh, you know, we can go into all of the details, but the Bible is simple. &gt;&gt; I am the Lord that health thee. &gt;&gt; Prophet of God said, healing is in the body. And that's the thing we have to look at. You know, the medical team and the medical staff, we're all happy. We're happy for them. We're happy for what they know. and uh they can look at the meters at the at all of the scopes and the different things and tell us what they say. But like the old brother or not the old brother but was with brother Brandham I think his child was about 12 years old and dying and he said to the nurse well he said dear you know you're looking at the medical equipment he said but I'm looking at the promise &gt;&gt; hallelujah &gt;&gt; we're so thankful today we can look at the promise and brother brother brother James and I know John and Marie and uh sister Jenny and all of the relatives of the Dodge family and all all the saints where Sister Sally sent word out. We were in prayer for her and really feeling for her and God has uh done something on her behalf. Brother Gilbert Oello's mom, I believe she's stabilizing some and and Sister Lois has been keeping us in in uh in informed. We have now those are those are physical things but we also have and I want the congregation to know on Friday night I was blessed to be able to be in the prayer service and it was wonderful. It just wonderful that people began to rejoice and began to worship uh after prayer and it was just hard to get away and I didn't leave here till about 10:30. uh if you want to really have a blessing uh not only for yourself but be a blessing because I want the congregation to know you were prayed for &gt;&gt; on Friday evening and different ones lifted you up in prayer and all who would come in the doors so we want even you that uh maybe come from some distances if you come from Burnaby or whatever more it's worth the trip &gt;&gt; it's worth the trip we're glad that you're here this morning but it's really worth the trip it's worth the trip on Wednesday evening ing. Uh I a couple Wednesdays ago, Brother Tom was speaking and I just personally just receive personal direction because I'm sitting back here. When I hear a man of God preach, regardless of who it is, I listen to it for a personal reason. &gt;&gt; I want to hear. I want to be fed. Don't we all? &gt;&gt; Amen. And so we're here to uh do that. I also I want to ask the congregation in your in your private time when you're alone and you have a moment and I would like you to remember the the camp we call it the camp the family camp whatever more and truly it is a family camp we had that uh you know personally I had that burden and vision and revelation I think maybe 22 23 years ago and uh you know I saw the young people and I felt that they their needed to be some place in the in a year is busy during the school year and the children are at school and they're at various activities and going here and there and you know maybe some sports things or some music lessons and there's so much today to keep the families parted and I thought it would just be a very special thing to be able to have a a week at least where the families could be together and it has been marvelous over the years. You know, young people, they end up having a deacon as a as a counselor and they never, you know, never dreamed that, you know, that they would get that close. And now they have other people who they would normally wouldn't get to know and they get to know them in a personal way. And and then next time they come to church and shake hands, it's a different kind. It's a different kind of a uh relationship. and and and then the believers themselves, we get to go there and be with one another and without all the pressures of life and maybe having to be engaged the next morning. I think it is a a wonderful time and I I really felt to ask you if you join with me in prayer for these days at camp. We want a Holy Ghost lifech changing days and time there. And I think all of us can say amen to that. We just want to hear. I I was praying already for brother uh uh brotherh Spencer that God would begin to just illuminate his heart and speak words to him and have him see what what God would have him speak when he comes here. I believe that that is uh we're going to we're in for a wonderful time. I don't want to just get enthused or happy in the meetings. I want to be able to come away and said, "God spoke to me." A lifechanging time. Brother Gary Walker, who you know was here and blessed us, uh he and brother Tom are going to speak right after our con our camp family camp. they will be going to uh Serbia and having having the speaking the convention there. I just want to say something about uh uh the meetings in Serbia. Of course, brother uh brother Milco has been so involved with those people for many many years because it's his former home country in Slovenia, which is one of the provinces of the former Yugoslavia. And but the people that go there, you say, you know, you I don't want you to relate it like our services. Exactly. Because many of the people who gather there, they don't have a church. They're maybe scattered in very various parts of the nation or countries and they come together and this is a very special time for them. Remember these brothers if you would. And then there's things happening behind the scenes. I think when we get on the other side, we're going to say, "I just saw the tip of the iceberg. We didn't see everything that was happening." So from week to week, I like to keep you kind of up to date. You You don't mind, do you? And uh uh so uh brother Gary sent me an email, sent also I think brother Tom the same email and he just wanted to thank us. He was he said I want to thank you brother Biscll for allowing me to come and and my testimony. He said I am getting letters and phone calls and emails from all over the world. He he didn't dream that the effect of the internet was going to have that much effect on his testimony. And the believers in Romania who streamed and and and saw the service services I should say they they have friends or relatives I guess or acquaintances in the Pentecostal church. And the Pentecostal church in Romania is really quite strong. And this one church at least or this group was very anti he said they were anti-branomism and they gave them uh this streaming the DVDs I guess it was and God so touched their heart with brother Gary's uh uh message and testimony and his preaching because he didn't just give a testimony that they have invited him to come to their church and their group. So, Brother Gary after the Serbia meetings is going into Romania to preach to a Pentecostal group. And I just say, God bless him. God endure him with great wisdom and power that he might declare the truth of God's word. &gt;&gt; I also got an email this last week from a couple in uh in Ohio. They go to brother Jeff Jenkins church and uh they said we have been sponsoring through one of the sponsoring children sponsoring uh uh organizations. We've been sponsoring a girl in Lut which is a a a country within South Africa and we've been sponsoring her for 13 years and she is now 17 and I think their sponsorship will end when she's perhaps 18. I'm just uh assuming that and uh I think if you're I'm I'm also just assuming that if you are sponsoring a child and you write them through one of these organization, it isn't that you can kind of convert them or try to do anything of a religious nature so much. But anyway, they told her uh when I was two years ago at brother Jeff's church, she said, "You spoke of the message hub." And so she said, "I mentioned this to this uh girl that we're sponsoring and uh and I I wish I had the picture of her. She's just a beautiful lovely girl from Lutu." And uh uh she went onto the hub. She does not speak English, but she went onto the hub and there's one message in her language and her language is sutu. And uh and and and she got that message book. It was the eagle stir as the eagle stirth her nest. And she read that book and wrote her sponsors back and said she was so happy to hear that God sent a prophet. And she said, "I know that he will strengthen and help me to understand the Bible." And I just thought, you know what extent God goes to. He will find his own &gt;&gt; wherever they are. &gt;&gt; He might inspire somebody. They might think they're just sponsoring a child for 13 years, but God knows exactly how he's he puts the whole network together. &gt;&gt; And you don't even know. You may think you're just doing your work, doing your job at your wherever, shopping, whatever more, but you don't know who you're meeting, and you don't know even what you're saying, but you're contacting somebody. You You know why? You're a witness. &gt;&gt; We're all witnesses here. &gt;&gt; You're a witness. whether you feel like it or not, you are a witness. &gt;&gt; Amen. So, I thought that that would just be uh something interesting for you. Praise the Lord. Uh let's just stand and and uh I hope you feel as good as I do. I'm sure you do. I hope you feel better than I do. Amen. Amen. It's always a nervous time just standing here behind a pull pit and been looking to the Lord a great deal for this service. Pray that God will give us understanding that the service this morning will probably be a first a first part. There's a a a you know, as a minister, you begin to labor in the word and and then uh the very heart of the subject sometimes just is uh so hard to define and and and do you know why? Cuz it's just too big. The subject just too big and starts getting deep and and uh I got into some areas here and I thought, am I really seeing what I'm saying? You know, I found that the prophet of God, he just may use the same statement two or three times down through the scripture. And then you'll find that that phrase is I found in the Old Testament and that's in the book of Daniel. And then when I went there and said, "Well, I just want to see what the Hebrew what does it mean?" That phrase, he just used it. And then the thing just begins to explode and I get lost. I just get lost. I say I'm going to have to set that aside or I won't even have a service for Sunday morning. &gt;&gt; We're thankful for his word. &gt;&gt; Just before we read the scripture, I'm going to be reading out of Matthew the 6th chapter, the Lord's Prayer. Let's just pray together. Lord Jesus, what a lovely time. What a lovely group of people. And I think of all of those that are on the internet and those that will archive and hear the archives from different parts of the world. I ask your blessing upon the bride, your bride. You had each one of them in your mind as you hung there on the cross and purchased their redemption. And we can say with the songwriter, "Oh, what a savior." &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Oh, what a savior. the lamb of God who gave himself for us and loved us. We thank you Lord Jesus for redemption for the full impact of it in our lives and I ask that you'll bless uh us that have gathered here today Lord lovely group of people. I just pray father your holy spirit and the presence of the holy angels uh that are nearby in in attendance standing at each side of us Lord that as your prophet said we feel their influence. May we not be so oh God uh taken up with this life or the children or the little things of this service but may we be conscious the unseen realm is right beside me the theophony body my word body oh God and when when the breath has left this body I will go to that one father God and from this realm to that eternal realm oh let the eternal realm press in nearby, oh God. Oh God, let us feed on the word of God. I pray in Jesus name, I ask that you'll give uh ability, Lord, and instruction to my own mouth and lips and hearing for the people more than the hearing of the ears, but the hearing of the heart and soul. We love you, Lord Jesus. We thank you. Amen. Amen. Thank you to the musicians for those of you that I trust you all have your Bibles, but in case you don't have your Bibles, I uh I want to put our Lord's Prayer up and uh so we can read together if you Our Father, which art in heaven, hallowed be thy name, thy kingdom come, thy will be done in earth as it is in heaven. Give us this day our daily bread, and forgive us our debts as we forgive our debtors, and lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil. For thine is the kingdom and the power and the glory forever. Amen. While you're still standing, I just want you to notice the two verses. Thy kingdom come and for thine is the kingdom. The kingdom being mentioned twice in these uh in these verses. May God bless his word to our hearts. You may have your seat. I would ask for your kind attention and may the Lord help uh help us to uh approach this theme. You can turn the lights back on if you would please. Uh I want to speak on uh contending with two kingdoms. Contending with two kingdoms. Now the term kingdom is not something that's commonly used amongst us. We we use uh the nations, the nation states, uh empires, there's monarchies, there's different descriptions to describe uh a a a nation as such. The Bible speaks a great deal about kingdom. A kingdom can be an empire or a monarchy, a a realm of sovereignty. Uh dominion, it can speak of dominion and power and rule and also control. We we often refer to England as the UK. Well, that is for the United Kingdom because they at one time had a much larger kingdom than they do today which included nations all over uh Africa and India and the world and parts of Asia. Uh today there are kingdoms which still remain. There's the kingdom of uh Saudi Arabia, Bahrain, uh Mali in and Ghana in Africa and there are different places which uh this would be more applicable. But uh here in uh our country be it United States or Canada uh or some other country that you might be from we are governed by the laws of that country. Uh that country will have their laws and those laws will be in the federal capital. Uh so this is the earthly kingdom. We all are in an earthly kingdom. uh or the kingdoms of this world as it's spoken of in the Bible. Uh but there is really only two kingdoms and the kingdom of God uh which we will emphasize as we go on is is within you. So the law of this kingdom is not in some federal capital. The law of this kingdom is in you. The Constitution of the United States is not in everybody, every American citizen's heart. The Constitution of Canada, I cannot say the Constitution of Canada is in me. I would want to be able to draw on it if I have a need. Uh you'd want to be able to draw on the Constitution of your country if you have a need. And uh uh we hear certain certain of the seven main parts of the US Constitution quoted from time to time, the right to bear arms and the right of speech and and freedom of worship and all of these things. But the the the the kingdom of God, I want to try to impress upon you that kingdom and speak uh speak from that perspective. And the scripture tells us that the kingdom of God is within you &gt;&gt; and the laws of that kingdom are within you. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We cannot say that of our country states. &gt;&gt; This is very different. But because we live in this world, I want to try to uh uh separate you from this world. And especially I pray that God will while we are here in this service be able to take our minds and and let it be divorced from this world. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Now, uh we won't have we won't turn the lights down for this. I The kingdom of this the kingdom brother Brandham said the kingdom is the word of God made spirit and life in our own life. The kingdom is the word of God &gt;&gt; made spirit and life in your own life. So the constitution of the United States isn't in you. We can say well the word is in us but th this kingdom really takes it a lot further. The kingdom the kingdom what makes up the kingdom. We're not talking about something abstract now. We're talking about a living kingdom. We're talking about a real kingdom. And the kingdom is the word of God. Not just the word of God, but the word of God made spirit and life in our own life. &gt;&gt; Now, do we in our respective countries, do we live up to the full benefits of that country? Probably not. and others don't understand what their country or their constitution uh stands for. And neither do we know all the benefits that are ours in the word of God. But we have a power and it's not some governing power. It is a holy spirit of God. the one who is the author of this word who has been sent and is committed to make this a living a living constitution within us. &gt;&gt; It's made uh to make it a a living word within us. So we have the law within us. We have the benefits within us. We have all of these things within us. And that is not just uh some uh uh some conversation. And I'm not saying this for conversation sake, not saying it for a sermon's sake. And I want you to listen, if you would please, to what the prophet said in the seventh seal. The kingdom of God is coming and it's becoming more from the negative to the positive as it has been. In other words, it has been getting nearer from the negative to the positive. This is the seventh seal. It's getting nearer from the negative to the positive. And now that oughten to choke people from justification to sanctification to the baptism of the Holy Ghost and then here. &gt;&gt; So the sanctification is one place, the justification is one place and the baptism of the Holy Ghost is one place and then here is another place. &gt;&gt; Would you agree with that? That's what he's saying. We're not adding anything to it. And then it is here and we're just drawing closer to God all the time. Now more from the negative to the positive. Now contending as I have given the title contending with two kingdoms. I want to take that may sound a little strange but I want to take this what this does contending can be contending is a state of something in other words it's a claim that something is true we are contending that something is true &gt;&gt; contending also is to compete it is to com to compete for something a prize or a trophy we are contending for the faith. &gt;&gt; We are contending for the prize of the high calling in Christ Jesus. We're competing. &gt;&gt; There may be others who make the claim. But we have a we have a special unique position, friends, as believers of a vindicated message. This is not some word that is in the Vatican and not some word in some headquarters. This is a word that came from heaven. &gt;&gt; Amen. and came to a vindicated prophet's mouth. So we have no reason to doubt it, no reason to question it. So we are competing in that sense. It's a struggle with something or somebody. In other words, we wrestle not against flesh and blood, but against principalities. So it's not only something for, but it's also something against. It's not only positive. We're not only running in this race. We're not only uh making a claim. We're claiming I'm a son and daughter of God. You claim you have an office. You have a position. You're a father. You're a husband. You're a mother. You're a wife. You're a a believer. You're a daughter of God. You're a son of God. Don't ever belittle that position. &gt;&gt; That's a high calling. Amen. &gt;&gt; This is We're talking about the creator of heavens and earth. We're talking about the giver of every good thing. We're talking about a God that spilled out the planets and spoke the stars and all of these things into existence. I don't know how, but I believe it because that's what the word of God says. &gt;&gt; And we and he is our father. &gt;&gt; Our father &gt;&gt; which art in heaven. My father &gt;&gt; thy kingdom come. Thy kingdom come. &gt;&gt; I'm in another one. I'm contending down here, but I'm declaring your kingdom is the true kingdom. I'm contending that I've heard the word of that kingdom. I'm contending that the constitution of of that kingdom actually dwells in me. I'm contending that the Holy Spirit of God has been sent to me and is with me now and in you as an individual to make that to make that constitution or make that law a part of my life. &gt;&gt; That's very different &gt;&gt; than just being an American, a Canadian or whatever else. Yes, &gt;&gt; we wrestle not against flesh and blood, but against principalities, against powers, against the rulers of darkness in this world. To contend is to dispute with somebody. And he went, speaking of Apostle Paul, into the synagogue and spake boldly for the space of three months, disputing and persuading the things concerning the kingdom of God. This is contending. &gt;&gt; And we are contending. &gt;&gt; We're contending for one kingdom and we're contending against the other kingdom. &gt;&gt; And you are contending every day. &gt;&gt; Yeah. It's a great great struggle and a great uh revelation actually. &gt;&gt; There are only two powers. Brother Brandham has said there's only two powers. &gt;&gt; Whatever country you come, whatever jurisdiction you're under, there's only two powers and there's really only two kingdoms. And the two powers really only two powers. There are only really two powers in all the universe of all of our differences between nations and differences between each other and everything. It all amounts up to two powers. There's only two powers and there's only two kingdoms. Two powers and two kingdoms. All the rest of the little minor things are connected with either one of these two powers, those powers. And those powers is God's power and Satan's power. And that is the power of life and the power of death. Now, that's the only two powers. I want to say today in all semimnity and seriousness, every person here is in one of those two kingdoms. &gt;&gt; You are not hanging somewhere in between. &gt;&gt; You're in the kingdom of God and under the power of eternal life &gt;&gt; or you're in the kingdom of Satan &gt;&gt; and under the reign of death. And it would be foolhardy. It would be the most foolish thing to sit and listen to the gospel of Jesus Christ and remain in that kingdom of darkness and kingdom of confusion and kingdom of defeat. I want you if you even if you even have the least sense that you might be there say I take a claim. I claim by the word of God my position in the kingdom of Jesus Christ. I take my place in the kingdom of God. Those are only two kingdoms. I'm contending for one. &gt;&gt; And you may have to contend for it this morning. &gt;&gt; Right. While you're here, how do I contend, brother Bisc? Make a confession. &gt;&gt; You can make the confession while I'm preaching. I'm a son of God. And if you haven't made a repentance, you can repent while I'm preaching. This this ministry, this preaching, this message is speaking to me. and I'm not sure where I'm born again. Father, in the name of Jesus Christ, your son, I repent of my wrongdoing. I repent of my uh sin. I repent of iniquity, which is to know to do good and not do it. I repent of it and I accept your gift of salvation through Jesus Christ. And you'll be born into the kingdom of God. And that's the only way to get into it. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; I understand there's a ship off the coast of British Columbia with a couple hundred people coming from Sri Lanka wanting to get into this country and uh and on international law they might get accepted. Australia has refused them and there's debate in our country whether we should accept them or not. Canada seems to be very tolerant and sometimes maybe too tolerant but uh anyway there'll be a process and the last boys that landed here about 76 of them and I think there's about 200 this time if they were going to turn them aside they have to turn them aside while they're international waters if they get into Canadian waters according to the international law you can't turn the ship away you've got to receive the refugees if they are refugees we don't No, but there'll be a process and you go through this process. Well, I tell you there is a process and the process you must repent. You must turn around. There is no other way. And the process is you must be baptized. If you haven't been baptized in the name of Jesus Christ, you can't come into this kingdom. &gt;&gt; Some say, "I don't think it matters how you're baptized." It matters. The constitution has been written. Hallelujah. It makes a difference. You must be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ to get into this kingdom. [Music] &gt;&gt; And then the life of the author, the very life of Jesus Christ. Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; We will be filled and baptized with the Holy Ghost. It's our job to preach the gospel. Your job to repent. Our job and your job together to baptize you. And it's God's job to fill you with the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And it's your job to yield to the Holy Spirit. It's your job to call on the name of the Lord. Brother, sister, this thing works. &gt;&gt; If this thing didn't work, I wouldn't be here. This thing works. Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; Glory to God. I thank God for the kingdom of God, the kingdom of heaven and the constitution, the word of God which is alive by the Holy Spirit. The kingdom is the word made alive in us by the spirit of God. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. One kingdom is the kingdom of righteousness with a divine structure. The kingdom is in you as apostle Paul has said &gt;&gt; this is very unique. You are unique. The kingdom is in you and you are in the kingdom &gt;&gt; both. &gt;&gt; Amen. In Christ is the mystery of God revealed. A beautiful quote, something you have to really ponder. The kingdom of God is within you, said the Bible, Jesus. We are not a denomination. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And that's not just making a statement. &gt;&gt; A denomination has a doctrine. &gt;&gt; All denominations have doctrines. When you see a church, you just remember that is just a building. When you say this church is just a building, &gt;&gt; the people who sit there listen to a word. They listen to a message. And what God is concerned about is not only where did the message that they're listening to come from, but how it was delivered to them. &gt;&gt; All kinds of people and churches will have this Bible laying on the pullpit, laying at the podium. But the channel through which it came, I tell you, I've got books, volumes, thick volumes like this. And they're they're filled with so many words, thousands and thousands of pages of scholars this and scholars that and liberal scholars and Orthodox scholars and the and the Hebrew view and the Jew the view of the Jews and and the early Phoenicians and all of these things. And when I'm reading some of those things that to see what do they got to say about the kingdom, what do they have to say about the resurrection, I don't have to read very far before I'm saying in my heart. I thank God for a prophet voice that made it so simple and made it so clear. Nobody has to make even a fool doesn't need to air therein. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. I'm glad I'm not in one of the kingdoms they describe. &gt;&gt; It doesn't work. There's no power in it. There's no absolute. &gt;&gt; I'm so glad we have a thus sayaith the Lord. &gt;&gt; We belong to a kingdom. And the kingdom is the word of God made spirit and life in our own life. &gt;&gt; Bringing to pass every promise. &gt;&gt; Let's say that together. Bringing to pass every promise. Say it again. Bringing to pass every promise. Lift your hand and say, "It's me. I believe that." &gt;&gt; Bringing to pass every promise. If you don't need it this morning, you'll need it one day. Hallelujah. That's the kingdom of God, &gt;&gt; bringing to pass every promise. [Music] &gt;&gt; You want to be resurrected. &gt;&gt; Who wants to have a resurrection &gt;&gt; into the kingdom of God? &gt;&gt; There's only one place to find it. That's in the word of God. &gt;&gt; That you must receive. &gt;&gt; You receive that word and the Holy Spirit will come and make that spirit in life in your own life. It's not good enough to say, "Well, it's wonderful. The preacher's enthused. It's in his life." That doesn't do you any good. You have to say, "In my own life." [Music] &gt;&gt; Every promise. &gt;&gt; It says we will meet him in the air. It says we will rise. I want that promise. &gt;&gt; I claim that promise. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Yes. Lord. &gt;&gt; And the word of God is one in his church today, &gt;&gt; making it the headship of the body &gt;&gt; that is redeemed to bring the message in the last day and to be taken up from the dead in the resurrection to go back to restore again as Adam and Eve in the beginning of the Garden of Eden. The three-fold mystery of God, his body. Oh, friends, I don't know how to tell you. I'm not reading this for you. I'm reading this for me. This is my promise. This is part of my constitution. This is part of the kingdom. The kingdom that is within me is declaring to me. I'm hearing words from my kingdom. &gt;&gt; And the Holy Spirit is making that spirit of life within me. Hallelujah. Even the word is the word of the kingdom. [Music] &gt;&gt; This isn't a message, friends. This isn't just a sermon. &gt;&gt; This is life to you. &gt;&gt; This is what God is saying to you. &gt;&gt; This is a kingdom. You are in the kingdom. &gt;&gt; You're a you're a participant. You're a citizen of the kingdom. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; They have my social security number. Your social insurance number. And they have all kinds of data in detail. They know all about you and they know about how many offenses you've had and how many times you've been speeding down the highway and how many times you got misdemeanors and they know a whole bunch about you and it's all back in the headquarters. Well, I tell you what, there's a headquarters. My headquarters knows what it wants to keep and knows what it wants to forget. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; That's the headquarters I want. They know more. They don't have to have numbers. They know my own nature. They know my character. They know where I came from. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. They know the seed gene that brought me down to this place. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; I believe the Holy Spirit was hovering over every child of God when they issued out of their mother's womb and has watched over your footsteps all down through this life because you're a resident. You're a citizen of another kingdom. God's saying, &gt;&gt; "You're my child, &gt;&gt; and he's not ashamed of it." &gt;&gt; He isn't interested in your past. He's interested in your future. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; The other is a perverted kingdom. is the one we're contending against. &gt;&gt; We're contending against it. &gt;&gt; It's very real. &gt;&gt; It permeates every area of your life. &gt;&gt; I don't care whether it is that you go to school. It's permeated your school rooms. &gt;&gt; I don't care where you shop. It's permeated the stores. It's permeated every area. It's permeated the news stand. It's permeated the service station. It's permeated, this kingdom has permeated science and education. It's permeated the economy. It's permeated everything. And we're contending against that kingdom. [Applause] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Satan cannot create. Satan can only pervert what has create what God has created. &gt;&gt; And all sin &gt;&gt; is righteousness perverted. &gt;&gt; And Satan perverts what God has made. &gt;&gt; And he made you to be a son or daughter. Listen to this. He made you to be a son or a daughter to him. And Satan perverted you. Changed your way of thinking. Change your mind, change your appetite, change your desire. That's how he works. &gt;&gt; He'll he he will in his perverted there's his system. He he changes your way of thinking. &gt;&gt; He changes your mind. &gt;&gt; See, he'll even have you start to think a different direction &gt;&gt; and you start entertaining thoughts and pretty soon he's changed your mind. Right. &gt;&gt; And then he changed your mind and changed your appetite. &gt;&gt; Then you find that the whole appetite you want to keep hearing things like that &gt;&gt; or hearing something. That's why gossip is treacherous. &gt;&gt; Gossip is absolutely treacherous. &gt;&gt; I want to declare in the name of the Lord, gossip is of the devil. &gt;&gt; What is yay is yay and nay is nay. And what is more of that? Jesus said is evil. &gt;&gt; You brothers and sisters, I'm saying to you, you watch what you hear &gt;&gt; and watch what you say [Applause] &gt;&gt; because Satan, the other kingdom of Satan is is is there to change your mind. You'll find I I find it str you have to struggle against that all the time. And then you start thinking, well, you desire, you know, your desire maybe isn't as fervent as it used to be and I don't know if I want to go to church or I I don't know if I want to be around those people or I maybe just kind of isolate myself or I don't know what kind of thought it is. He's got a whole multitude of thoughts. &gt;&gt; This is his kingdom. Right? &gt;&gt; And you start thinking something about, and brother Brennham deals with, you start thinking something about a certain person. &gt;&gt; And uh and you'll find out if you're not careful, it's Satan trying to change your thinking. &gt;&gt; One time you thought they're fine. You're they're a brother, they're a sister, and he wants to change your thinking. &gt;&gt; And then he'll change your mind. &gt;&gt; That person not my friend. That person's my enemy. You know, if you start thinking that and then it says uh you change your mind or change your appetite and change your desire. All right, you can take that off, please. Now, now Satan's Eden. In Satan's Eden of sin and unbelief, the prophet said, "In Satan's Eden, a religious perversion, a perverted, perverted kingdom, a religious perversion, &gt;&gt; perverted." Satan loves religion. &gt;&gt; And he loves to turn the message into a mere religion. &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham speaks of it clearly. It just becoming a tradition. We don't want the Lord's table to become a tradition or footwashing to become a tradition or to say that we believe in Malachi 4. That's not enough. &gt;&gt; We want to have and be able to say my heart has been turned back to the faith of the fathers. &gt;&gt; And furthermore, we should expect the same thing, the same thing that the fathers had. You can have it as well. You're a citizen of this kingdom. &gt;&gt; I'm saying that. &gt;&gt; I'm not preaching. I'm declaring that. &gt;&gt; Every bloodwashed son and daughter of God. And if you're not, don't leave this room. Don't leave this place until you know in your heart what Brother Eisll's preaching is true within your own soul and life. &gt;&gt; I'm bloodbought. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. I've been purchased. God has declared it and I confess his declaration. &gt;&gt; Speaking of Satan's Eden, he said, "This kingdom," listen to this declaration by the prophet, "This kingdom has to die." &gt;&gt; Listen to his second statement. This kingdom shall die. &gt;&gt; Oh. Oh. Do &gt;&gt; you know what, friends? In heaven, and it speaks of those that saw the uh uh uh uh saw the Satan, the old serpent, the devil, cast into the lake of fire. And the people didn't weep. They didn't sympathize. They didn't say, "That's too bad." They rejoiced. &gt;&gt; They said, "Hallelujah." And when you have this kind of vindicated prophet told people who their name is, told them where that pillar of fire was, told them their address, told them their disease, and when he says to you, "This kingdom shall die, this church ought to rejoice." &gt;&gt; Not at my preaching at those words. &gt;&gt; There should be something in your soul says, "I can't wait till this kingdom dies. I want to see this wickedness destroyed. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; I just feel like quitting preaching right now. Go home and rejoice the rest of the day. This kingdom is going down. &gt;&gt; This kingdom is being destroyed. And when you hear the things in the news, it shouldn't surprise you. &gt;&gt; The prophet said some he he may made some great declarations about this generation, about Leodysia, about America, and about the world as a whole. It's going down. &gt;&gt; The economy is shaking. &gt;&gt; It has been a meltdown of banks, banking system. And as of today, it's not banks that are going down. its nations are going down. Iceland went bankrupt. Ireland went bankrupt right now. They just bailed out uh Greece &gt;&gt; right &gt;&gt; with Merkel who is the premier prime president of Germany. I think gave about 58 billion euros to to and get the community of nations to bail out Greece. And they had the they had dissension amongst the Euro nations, the Euro kingdoms because uh I understood that Italy and Spain are hanging on with their fingernails. &gt;&gt; So we can't contribute. We're barely hanging on ourselves. So now it's not a meltdown. Say, "Well, the bank, you know, I can't get money from the bank." Don't worry. Whole nations can't get money. They're they're they're failing. Whole nations. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And if you understand, I've even just read recently where there's been economists that says the second wave hasn't hit yet. &gt;&gt; And they didn't just say it as a statement. They said the first the first meltdown in America, North America here, was the was the meltdown of of of the retail market of homes. But they said the big one is the commercial, &gt;&gt; high office buildings and warehouses and factories because those buildings have long-term have long-term uh mortgages on them. But the long-term mortgage on your home can be 30 years, but a long-term mortgage on an industrial an industrial or commercial complex is only 10 years. That's a long term. And so some of these mortgages were all in place when the meltdown came. They maybe only have two or three years yet to go and the banks have already stated they will not refinance them. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; And they said that will be the big one. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; We get quiet. &gt;&gt; We should say praise God. &gt;&gt; This kingdom has to go down. &gt;&gt; This kingdom has to then what do we do? Well, &gt;&gt; grow a garden. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Have a chicken. Right. &gt;&gt; Have a pig or a cow or something in your backyard. &gt;&gt; Are you serious? I've been in places where they had to have that. &gt;&gt; I was here. I was in Serbia when they didn't have any money. There was a whole shoe box, a whole shoe box of money. And there was billions and billions and billions of currency money in that. And you know what was happening to it? The kids were playing with it. I said, 'Hey, can I have some of that? Sure. So, I just took $30 billion out and stuck it in my pocket. I think I'll go back and buy all of Vancouver. That $30 billion wouldn't buy a loaf of bread. &gt;&gt; Can you imagine that? That's That's like a story joke. That's reality. &gt;&gt; That money was printed &gt;&gt; on good paper and they said when they were done printing it, it wasn't worth the paper it was written on. &gt;&gt; Right. I'm going up &gt;&gt; in the first resurrection. &gt;&gt; My constitution says that &gt;&gt; the law of my country, my citizenship is in heaven. Your citizenship &gt;&gt; is in heaven. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Praise God. Praise God. &gt;&gt; Now the prayer that Jesus taught actually has all the elements of the cit of the nation of the kingdom in it. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Our father &gt;&gt; which art in Washington. No. Which is in London. No. And thank God it's not in Ottawa. &gt;&gt; Our father, &gt;&gt; the one I came out of. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Which art in heaven &gt;&gt; beyond this world. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Our Father which art in heaven, &gt;&gt; hallowed, holy &gt;&gt; is your name. &gt;&gt; We can't say that about any of our federal systems. We can't say holy is your name. &gt;&gt; In fact is if you're brave enough, you'd say it's it's not truth that comes out of there. It's wickedness often that comes out of there. It's all kinds of lobbying and all kinds of of of conniving and all kinds of thing taking place. But we have a holy kingdom. Our father which art in heaven. Hallow and holy. Holy and righteous is thy name. &gt;&gt; First thing, thy kingdom come. &gt;&gt; Thy kingdom come. &gt;&gt; Thy government rule. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. We want that kingdom come. &gt;&gt; We want that government. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. We want it to come into play. And we want it. We even want that government to rule more in our lives now. &gt;&gt; Teach me your laws. &gt;&gt; Teach me your ways. &gt;&gt; Thy kingdom come &gt;&gt; and thy will be done &gt;&gt; on earth &gt;&gt; on earth. We're not waiting for some time in the sky. Thy will be done on earth. &gt;&gt; Now establish, oh God, thy kingdom. And I can tell you, you cannot find out what this kingdom is about outside of the message of the hour. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Give us this day our daily bread. That's the economy. Forgive us our debts as we forgive our debtors. That's the justice system. &gt;&gt; And lead us not into temptation, the things that are desirable and entertaining to us. &gt;&gt; Don't lead us into temptation, but deliver us from evil. Loose us from every band. Loose us from everything that would try to bind us down. &gt;&gt; Why? Why? Why do we want this economy? Why do we want this justice system? Why do we want not to be led into it? We want to walk in a way of truth and life. Why do we want that? For thine is the kingdom. That's what this kingdom is all about. &gt;&gt; And the power &gt;&gt; to bring it to pass. And the glory. &gt;&gt; How long? Till the next election. Forever. &gt;&gt; And ever. Amen. Amen. Forever and ever. Amen. Amen. So be it. Forever. Forever. And it'll never change. There's not going to be a new set of promises at the next election. There is no election. &gt;&gt; This is a theocracy, not a democracy. A theocracy &gt;&gt; by a righteous king. &gt;&gt; And we're right at that stage in the message &gt;&gt; where he'll become king of kings. &gt;&gt; And Lord of lords, &gt;&gt; hallelujah. prophecy. Prophecy of Jesus coming. There's a prophecy in Isaiah. You know it well. Now, just captivate every thought in mind in your thoughts now. And hold to every word as I go through this because it's just I had a struggle almost left it out. But the prophecy in Isaiah says, "Unto us a child is born. Unto us a son is given and the government &gt;&gt; shall be upon his shoulder." Amen. &gt;&gt; And then Isaiah also 22 says, "And the key of the house of David, &gt;&gt; because he is the son of David, &gt;&gt; the key of the house of David will I lay upon his shoulder. &gt;&gt; And so shall he open &gt;&gt; and none shall shut." &gt;&gt; And he shall shut &gt;&gt; and none shall open. Amen. &gt;&gt; Can I just paraphrase it for you a wee bit? And he shall open the word. &gt;&gt; He shall open the seals. &gt;&gt; And no man can shut them. &gt;&gt; And why? Because he has the key of David. &gt;&gt; He has the authority. He's the only one who can do it. &gt;&gt; That's why in heaven when John says, "Oh, there's no one to open the book." And he turned and and he said, "Don't don't weep. The lion of the tribe. The lion of the tribe of Judah. He's prevailed. &gt;&gt; The lion of the tribe of Judah is the son of David. It's kingship. The king has prevailed has opened the seals and one stood up to receive it because one that was going to receive it had to have the the price &gt;&gt; and he had paid it with his blood &gt;&gt; and he says, "I will come and claim that book." Listen to me, my dear friends of Cloverdale. Your name was in that book. &gt;&gt; Your record was in that book. &gt;&gt; Your failures were in that book. Your sins were in that book. All of your weaknesses were in that book. But the lamb said, "I will take that book." &gt;&gt; This is the king. &gt;&gt; He said, "I can remember what I want to remember and I can forget what I want to forget. That's the kingdom we're in. &gt;&gt; I'm living in that kingdom. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And and God uh God help the person try to remove me or remove you out of that citizenship. [Music] &gt;&gt; And these prophecies include, are you staying with me? &gt;&gt; Say amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I want you wide awake and alert. Don't be distracted by anything. &gt;&gt; And he says these these prophecies uh uh uh include the first and the second coming &gt;&gt; of Jesus Christ. The first to buy his bride and the second one to marry her. &gt;&gt; So that's what the key is all about. &gt;&gt; And that's why it says it's on his shoulder &gt;&gt; because brother Brandham goes through that in the marriage ceremony. And he says, "And unto us a child is born, and the government will be upon his shoulder." &gt;&gt; And it says in Isaiah that the key of the house of David will I lay upon his shoulder. &gt;&gt; And he shall open and no man can shut and he can shut and no one shall open. Then when the prophet of God comes down into the Philadelphiaian church age just before the Leodysian church age and he goes to the scripture into the angel of the church of Philadelphia. &gt;&gt; Right? &gt;&gt; These things says he that is holy. &gt;&gt; He that is true. &gt;&gt; He that hath the key of David. &gt;&gt; So now we know who has the key of David. The Lord Jesus Christ who was revealing himself through the church ages in the dispensation just passed told that generation, "This is the one that has the key of David. &gt;&gt; And he openeth." He says the same thing that Isaiah said, "He opens and no man shutth. And he shutth and no man opens." &gt;&gt; He says, "But what does this key signify?" &gt;&gt; The answer lies in the position of the key. It's not in his hand. &gt;&gt; It's not worn around his neck. &gt;&gt; He alone has the use of the key. &gt;&gt; For he alone opens and shuts. And no man has that right but Jesus himself. &gt;&gt; Where is the key? It's on his shoulder. And what does the shoulder have to do with it? &gt;&gt; The government shall be upon his shoulder. &gt;&gt; He said the phrase the phrase here's the lesson. The phrase the government on his shoulder comes from the wedding ceremony of the east when the bride has been committed. &gt;&gt; When the bride has been committed &gt;&gt; and it happened in this time that the bride became committed. &gt;&gt; You have lived in that season. &gt;&gt; We are living in that season. The bride has been committed. Yeah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Are you following me yet? &gt;&gt; Here he stands. The key is on his shoulder. &gt;&gt; And the bride has been committed. &gt;&gt; That prophecy couldn't take place till now. &gt;&gt; People are coming to the realization, I'm not a church member. I'm the bride of Jesus Christ &gt;&gt; and I'm a committed one. [Applause] Nothing can change. &gt;&gt; And the bride is committed to the groom &gt;&gt; and she takes off her veil &gt;&gt; and places it over on the groom's shoulders &gt;&gt; where the key was. She takes the veil off and puts it on his shoulders, signifying that not only is she under his dominion, &gt;&gt; that she has transferred her rights to him. &gt;&gt; Listen sisters, listen my dear sisters. This is the pattern of God that she has transferred her rights to him and he is the head but also that he bears the responsibility. Every man, every husband bears the responsibility of a spiritual headship in his home. Hallelujah. And in this church and in the bride of Jesus Christ and the care and the care and that he and he alone, no one else, no other man, no other p power has any right and responsibility. I know we have a social network. I know we have social aid. But I really think if a man has faith in God, God will provide for him and his family. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Do you believe that as a church? &gt;&gt; I believe that's the perfect way. Now, we need to contend against the other kingdom. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Maybe you could say more on that later, but anyway. And that beloved is the key of David. &gt;&gt; God is sovereign. He forneew by divine decree exactly who would be in his bride. &gt;&gt; I don't have that power. I don't know how many this church could be packed with 500 or 600 or 800 or a thousand people. I wouldn't know who's the bride of Jesus Christ. But our father &gt;&gt; which art in heaven, &gt;&gt; holy is thy name. Thy kingdom come. You know who's in the kingdom. You know who's been called and you know who's committed. &gt;&gt; I'm talking about commitment, friends. &gt;&gt; And I feel at this time, those of you that come here to this congregation, you don't want to come here just to sit and listen to a sermon. You don't want to come here just because there's friendship or there's fellowship or whatever more. You want to come because you're committed to a cause. &gt;&gt; You're committed to a vision. &gt;&gt; You're committed. And you know that God's call for this age is being achieved and accomplished. We're trying to do our part. &gt;&gt; Not that others aren't. &gt;&gt; Don't get that in your mind. But we have a call. We have a certain a certain mission. Yeah. &gt;&gt; I find that the Apostle Paul, Apostle Paul, even though he's been an apostle for years, he keeps saying, "Apostle Paul, uh, called by the Lord Jesus Christ." &gt;&gt; And I I hesitate to say this, but I can tell you I would not be standing here, and neither would I even stand in the shadow of Apostle Paul. But I said, I'm I'm not even in this town by my own wish. I'm here by a call of God to do a certain thing. And and and brother Cydney Jackson stood in a little log church and he looked up at the logs. He says, "Long, straight, and narrow like the people." He said, "Solid, straight people grown by." These logs were grown by God. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And he says, "I don't know why, brother Eddie." He said, "I don't know why, but he said, uh, the the the the spirit of God has a has a mission, has a work for this place to do." &gt;&gt; And I and and I I had no idea of going any place even beyond the boundaries of Cloverdale. I And we had a little radio station. I'm just going back because we had the radio station because we were burdened for the local area. I never dreamed. I never dreamed that what would take place has taken place. But I say that's all part of the call of God. And God called you called you to this place not to sit here and listen to a service and just enjoy the music. He called you to be part of that call. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. That's part of the call. &gt;&gt; The call is to reach the last elected seed. &gt;&gt; I want to be a part of it. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I want to be a part of it. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I feel it's my right. Your right. &gt;&gt; Our right. &gt;&gt; God has made it possible. It's our right &gt;&gt; to be able to spread that word and get it out. &gt;&gt; What a great thing. &gt;&gt; That's that that's the work of the kingdom, friends. &gt;&gt; The rest of it is just little things we have to do. Amen. &gt;&gt; You have to help me so I get through this. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And she's committed to the groom. &gt;&gt; It says, "And then he chose her. She did not choose him." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He called her. &gt;&gt; I say he called you. &gt;&gt; You did not call him. &gt;&gt; She did not come on her own. &gt;&gt; He died for her. &gt;&gt; He washed her in his own blood. He paid the price for her. She belongs to him &gt;&gt; and to him alone. &gt;&gt; Amen. She is wholly committed to him and he accepts the obligation. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. He is her head for Christ is the head of his church as Sarah called Abraham Lord. Even even so the bride is happy that he is her Lord. He speaks and she obeys for that is her delight. Brother Tom's been speaking on obedience. Full obedience. It gives us uh uh what to the word &gt;&gt; gives us right to the word to the tree of life. &gt;&gt; Full obedience. &gt;&gt; But now take goes even a step further. He says she delights in obedience. &gt;&gt; Marriage time. In other words, you say, "How do we get with this with the two kingdoms?" Marriage time is when the bridegroom makes known that he is the one with the key. &gt;&gt; That's when he makes known. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And it was the bridegroom. It was your bridegroom that was speaking and say, "There's been a blast." &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And I have to go east. I have to go west. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And seven angels come down. This is the bridegroom. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; And and what was he? Did he have Did he have blonde hair? Did he have another color? No, he had white hair &gt;&gt; showing that he was the judge &gt;&gt; of a kingdom &gt;&gt; because he's coming into judgment as the king, &gt;&gt; the son of David. &gt;&gt; He'll be son of David during the millennium. &gt;&gt; Whether you know it or not, you're moving towards the millennium faster than you even believe. Amen. &gt;&gt; I want to be in that kingdom. &gt;&gt; Do you know when the millennium comes and when we get caught away? There's only two places to be here in the tribulation &gt;&gt; or caught away in the rapture. &gt;&gt; That's the only two places. There's only two kingdoms. &gt;&gt; I think everybody in this room ought to say, "I want to be in that rapture &gt;&gt; at all cost." Hallelujah. [Music] &gt;&gt; Lord Jesus, thy kingdom come. &gt;&gt; Thy will be done on earth as it is in heaven. &gt;&gt; Give us what we need for our daily bread. &gt;&gt; Uh we don't need to buy boats and cottages and all kinds of things. If God gives it to you, fine. I'm not against that. I'm just simply saying we don't uh lust after the we don't strive after that. That's not our our ambition is for the kingdom of God. [Music] &gt;&gt; God prospers you. Fine. &gt;&gt; That's fine with me. &gt;&gt; Then God has a purpose in it. &gt;&gt; So the veil now the marriage has come. the marriage time and she's committed &gt;&gt; and he makes known himself to her. &gt;&gt; I'm the bridegroom. &gt;&gt; That that you felt inside that that that attraction. &gt;&gt; I always ask when a young couple begin to come to know one another and they feel that I'm for a certain person, it's what what attracted you? What is it that attracted you? And it should be some godly character. It should be some something that is from above &gt;&gt; and we were attracted to him. And then here comes the servant and the mass has come and oh it's oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh and then the secrets of the hearts are revealed and public and we hear it on the tape and can read it in the book and &gt;&gt; oh it we're so aruck. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And then that mouth begins to speak &gt;&gt; and begins to tell us &gt;&gt; this is the time of the marriage. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. This is the time that Rebecca must come to Isaiah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. This is the time the son as we've waited uh now the now the marriage must take place &gt;&gt; and a ceremony must be conducted &gt;&gt; and he conducts it in invisible union of the bride of Jesus Christ and a people become aware. &gt;&gt; How do we become aware? &gt;&gt; From the constitution of our nation. &gt;&gt; Amen. It tells a great wedding's going to take place &gt;&gt; and that the father's preparing a table &gt;&gt; and the invitation has gone out &gt;&gt; and some are too busy. They're busy with their business or they're busy with their education or they're too busy with something and they can't get there. They're just too busy with life. Maybe they're too busy being lazy. &gt;&gt; I want to be eaten up. Amen. &gt;&gt; I tell you, my brother, my sister, &gt;&gt; I sometimes think things are wrong with me. I I feel the same fervor. &gt;&gt; I did my early 20s. I must do this. &gt;&gt; I must speak this. &gt;&gt; I said this morning, oh God, give me the give me the give me the strength of my youth to preach this message. &gt;&gt; We're contending for a kingdom and we're contending against a kingdom. And everything of this world is opposed to the kingdom that God has called you in. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Try and take away your spirit. Try and take away your desire. Try to take away your time. Try to take away everything. Don't you let him. &gt;&gt; You deny him. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; The veil. The veil was torn when he made the purchase of you. The veil was torn between &gt;&gt; the Holy of Holies and the people. And now he went into the holiest place. And he didn't say you can't go in. He says come on in. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; He made it accessible to you. &gt;&gt; I've taken full responsibility. Amen. &gt;&gt; The veil was taken away. &gt;&gt; Can I have a few more minutes? &gt;&gt; Now the inception. Follow it very close is a very important part. The inception of the kingdom of God. God intended. God intended to continue the creation through Adam. And God blessed him and said unto him, "Be fruitful." Now I've done this. I've created all of this. Now you be fruitful and multiply and replenish the earth. Replenish the earth is simply to make it full. &gt;&gt; To complete it, to accomplish what started. &gt;&gt; Now I've got my image and I make you go of the earth. Now you go ahead and fill it. Amen. &gt;&gt; And you know that the children the way we came was not God's ordained way. &gt;&gt; He had the power to bring them another way. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And so God was commissioning him now you fill it. You complete it. You continue this creation and the power that he was given. And the and the prophet said in the fundamental foundation for faith. Listen closely now. Are you getting weary? No, &gt;&gt; we get where it's too important. I just shut down. We go again. If you want to continue on. &gt;&gt; All right. That's three hands. How many more hands is? All right. &gt;&gt; He says, "Man was made as a secondary God on earth. He was given the power to control all things, all elements of the earth. Adam was given these powers. But then the power that he was given to make himself &gt;&gt; staggering statement. The power he was given to make himself in other words to reproduce himself. &gt;&gt; The power to make himself is where he fell. &gt;&gt; The very power he had to bring forth a son and daughters and replenish. Listen friends, all the humanity that we see on the earth didn't come according to God's original way. &gt;&gt; The original way was when Jesus came and he saw certain ones. He says, "Follow me." &gt;&gt; Follow me. I'll make you fishers of men. &gt;&gt; And he transplanted them from the kingdom of this world into the kingdom of God. &gt;&gt; I'll prove it to you. &gt;&gt; They became transplanted. Amen. &gt;&gt; Displaced persons by the world's standard. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And he said, "And that is where he fell." And Adam could speak to the winds, it would stop. He could speak to the trees and they would obey him. He could speak to the wildlife, it would obey him. He could speak to the waters, every what it was, everything obeyed Adam. And before Adam could establish the kingdom of God. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; In the earth, Satan entered through the serpent. &gt;&gt; Seowing his seed from which the kingdoms of this world would spring forth. &gt;&gt; True. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; In the greatest battle &gt;&gt; ever fought, he said Michael and his angels fought against Lucifer. what they do. Are you still listening? &gt;&gt; The pain I went through God dragging my mind and through this message. I don't want you to be I don't want you at all to be wearied &gt;&gt; if it would. I've just closed and we start again. But I want to finish this part if I could. Amen. &gt;&gt; He says that Michael and his angels fought. &gt;&gt; You know what? I would I'd take another word I've been using. They contended with &gt;&gt; there was contention. &gt;&gt; And they fought &gt;&gt; with Lucifer and his angels. And he had deceived those angels to believe a lie. &gt;&gt; And he fought against them. &gt;&gt; And he could not prevail. and the angels and the and the prophet says uh the the prophet says uh just let me get to it now. And then it was thrown down. He says, "And they fought against Lucifer and his angels. And then it that battle was thrown down from heaven, cast out of heaven to the earth, and fell on human beings. &gt;&gt; Hello, friends. Are you a human being? &gt;&gt; This battle fell upon you. &gt;&gt; You didn't ask for it, but this battle fell upon you. &gt;&gt; There's only two powers. &gt;&gt; There was only two in heaven. And it was God and righteousness and Satan in rebellion. &gt;&gt; Satan and his deception. And that battle fell upon humans. &gt;&gt; And this is the battle that we have. And he went on to say, "And then the battle from angels became human battles. &gt;&gt; This is our battle. &gt;&gt; And Satan came to destroy God's creation. &gt;&gt; And we're here saying we deny him. We deny him that right. &gt;&gt; We see God trying to destroy a son or a daughter of God. We claim them. We deny it &gt;&gt; at all cost. &gt;&gt; What might it cost? It'll probably cost prayer. &gt;&gt; It may cost fasting. &gt;&gt; It may calling on God. &gt;&gt; It may call calling on the forces, &gt;&gt; other brothers and sisters. It may call on it. But too often we give in. &gt;&gt; Well, I guess that's the way it has to be. That's not the way it has to be. [Applause] &gt;&gt; Peter was in jail. The authorities had taken him. Their kingdom of this world and of darkness had taken him. And they gathered together and had prayer. And they're praying for Peter to come out. And Peter came out. And they wouldn't stop praying till he came out. &gt;&gt; We say, "Well, we have another way or we have something else we can do." Listen my friend, my brother, my sister, let's not surrender up &gt;&gt; to the kingdom of this world. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He says, "And then the battle begins here on earth and begin in us and it's been raging here ever since." &gt;&gt; Right? our forefather Adam. As soon as he lost that power and soon as he lost that power to create himself to bring himself forth and he lost it, the battle began to rage right then. It fell. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And Satan, Lucifer, used a serpent &gt;&gt; who God had made because he allowed all of these things to happen. &gt;&gt; You know why he allowed it to happen? because he knew you and I would come forth in this last age. And he intended that you and I would be victorious because we would hear a word that would strengthen you, that would open your eyes and your understanding, and we would not cower to the kingdom of this world. [Music] &gt;&gt; You young men and young ladies, don't you cower. &gt;&gt; Satan will throw every delight your way. Don't give in to him. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Please just bear with me a little bit. And so the battle raged in the mind of Eve. the process. The prophet said, she looked and then she began to think and as she began to think, her mind got changed. &gt;&gt; When her mind was changed, she entered into the act &gt;&gt; and that's how it happened. And that thought happens today. &gt;&gt; Two seeds and two kingdoms. Pray. God help me and God help you. I've just got to finish this up to a certain point. &gt;&gt; Amen. And the Lord God said unto the serpent, because thou hast done this, thou art cursed above all cattle, and every beast of the field, upon thy belly shalt thou go, and dust shalt thou eat all the days of thy life. And I will put enmity, contention between thee and the woman, and between thy seed and her seed, thy seed, serpent, and her seed, the seed of the woman. and it shall bruise thy head. The woman's seed will bruise your head. And the word is actually will crush your head and thy and thou shalt bruise his heel. &gt;&gt; The seed of the woman was none other than Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; And so now here's the contention. I'll put contention between these seeds. And Adam found out I like what one brother said when they talked about Jesus and those that were rose up against him. They said, "Who was it that was trying to bruise him?" That was no big mystery. Who who was holding stones in their hands? &gt;&gt; Who who wanted to bruise him? &gt;&gt; That was another seed that come from another. I tell you what, friends, that's why we don't want to have any part of that. We're not here to destroy people. We're here to build up the body of Jesus Christ. We don't know who they are. And we just say, "Oh God, I know one thing that all of yours that are yours, none will, no man can pluck them out of your hand." &gt;&gt; And and then and then the prophet said in the spoken word, listen to this closely. As Adam found his wife pregnant with the seed of death of Satan's lie, she had accepted. Joseph found his wife pregnant with the seed of God, which was the word she had accepted. [Applause] &gt;&gt; Adam, the first Adam, found his wife pregnant with the seed of Satan, which she accepted. And Joseph found his wife pregnant with the seed of almighty God by the word she accepted. &gt;&gt; That principle applies today. If we want the benefits of God, accept the word of God. &gt;&gt; It comes from that promise. &gt;&gt; And thus commenced to build Satan commenced to build his kingdom. And as I said before, the kingdom is is his domain. &gt;&gt; And here's how it went. And I'm going to be brief as I need you to follow very closely. And the sons of Ham, Kush, uh, Ms. Misraam, and Foot and Canaan. And Kush begat Nam Nam Nimrod and he began to be a mighty one in the earth and the beginning of his kingdom. It's the first time it appears in the Bible. Satan was the first to get to Eve. &gt;&gt; He's the first to do a lot of things. &gt;&gt; He got to He got into Israel before Jesus did. &gt;&gt; He got to Eve before Adam did. And now he starts building a kingdom before God even can get his kingdom established. And the beginning of his kingdom was Babel. &gt;&gt; The beginning of his kingdom was confusion. It's still confusion. &gt;&gt; The building of his kingdom was a whole myriad of voices. And it's still a whole myriad of voices. I don't care where you hear. Oh, you ought to do this and you should do that and listen to the still small voice. God has a voice. It's &gt;&gt; not the voice of your neighbor or the voice of someone else. It's the voice of God. &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; And brother Brandham says in God's only provided place of worship. Notice nothing in the Bible types the denominations but Babylon. &gt;&gt; So there was the beginning of the kingdom. The beginning of Nimrod's kingdom was Babel. And now we come all these thousands of years. And you have a prophet saying nothing in the world types that Babel but Babylon. &gt;&gt; And Babylon was founded by Nimrod. &gt;&gt; And Nimrod was a renegade &gt;&gt; in the Ephesian church age. He says, "Now, to get the real meaning of what we're about to go into, I must caution you to ever keep in mind that religion matters uh that keep in mind that religion, spiritual matters, if you like, is composed of two parts. &gt;&gt; Religion is composed of two parts that intertwine but are as opposite as black and white. Religion and the spiritual world are made up of those two trees &gt;&gt; which had their roots in Eden. Both the tree of life &gt;&gt; and the tree of knowledge of good and evil. Remember it is the tree of knowledge of good &gt;&gt; and evil. &gt;&gt; You're all going to go out and I imagine most every one of you going to go into a car. That's good. But it's also evil. You may turn on a radio and hear some news or hear the weather or hear the traffic report. That's good. But it's also evil. &gt;&gt; You're going to go to the store and you're going to eat food. It's going to be good. Much of it's been refined till it's evil. &gt;&gt; And he says the spiritual world are made up of those two trees which had their roots in Eden. Both the tree of life and the tree of knowledge of good and evil stood in the midst of the garden and no doubt their very branches intertwined with each other. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You know I guess maybe some people excuse me I have to I have to just plow along here. Maybe some I don't know if some stood in Eden and if they saw those trees and saw their branches intertwined and they said well which is which &gt;&gt; I don't know. This is where I would like to come to you. I'll just give you a little a little quote to think about and this is why I couldn't come to it because it is so it is so invading in every part of every life mine, yours, every home, every church. Satan is the master deceiver, &gt;&gt; deception. And if it is possible, Jesus said he deceived the very elect. &gt;&gt; Those are are are import those are potent words. &gt;&gt; And he is so successful that he has multitudes of people who believe they're in his kingdom, &gt;&gt; but they believe they're in the other kingdom. &gt;&gt; Now, that is a real master stroke of deception. I never want to be there. &gt;&gt; I I I'm I'm really going to come down right where we are. &gt;&gt; Don't Don't get uh don't feel I'm imposing something. But how do you know you're not in the kingdom of How do you know you're not in Satan's kingdom? &gt;&gt; I have a reason for asking. How do you know? You have the Baptist church is over here and the free Methodists is over there and they believe they're in the kingdom of God just like you do. And those over there believe they're in the kingdom of God. They don't agree with each other, but they believe they're in the kingdom of God. &gt;&gt; And the Catholic people believe they're in the kingdom of God for sure. And the churches all over this country. What makes you think you're in the kingdom of God? Because they believe they're in the kingdom of God. Well, it would come down to what is it that you believe? &gt;&gt; And they would open up the Bible and they'd say, "Baptize in the name of the Father, Son, and Holy Ghost." And that's how I was baptized. And that's right in the word of God. And that's why I'm in the kingdom of God. I received Jesus Christ. I repented of my sins. I shed tears at the altar. And that's why I'm in the kingdom of God. I repented like you repented. Okay. It it starts getting sticky, doesn't it? &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; And maybe they were more sincere than even you were. &gt;&gt; And you could tell some some people would say, "I called out on God. I screamed. I was so miserable in my life." And furthermore, there was a dramatic change and transformation. You say, "Wow, that's what happened to me. And then you say, "Well, what is what is the it it get down? You're in the kingdom of God. I'm in the kingdom of God." Now, what is it really when we get right down to the short strokes where the rubber hits the road? What is it that you believe? What What do you believe about Malachi 4? What do you believe? Because that's key. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; This isn't just small stuff. This is key. This is important. &gt;&gt; Well, I believe that was John the Baptist. Oh, this is where things start pulling apart. &gt;&gt; What do you believe about revelation? What do you believe? What do you believe about a prophet of God coming in this generation? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And then you start finding out the ways have parted. Yes. &gt;&gt; So now the critical the critical the critical point is this becomes the critical point either this that you have hung all your eternal destiny on. Either it's remember there's only two kingdoms. &gt;&gt; There's and there's only a rapture and a tribulation &gt;&gt; and there's only a heaven and a hell. There's no big gray area here, folks. Leodys has made everything kind of gray. You're this way. We just accept you and everybody loves Jesus and everybody. That's nonsense. &gt;&gt; They don't love Jesus. Jesus is the word. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; So now it becomes critical. And this is why this is why we so treasure I so treasure. We talk about tapes, books, this that the other thing. It's not textbooks, just those things. It is that God our father which are in heaven. &gt;&gt; Holy is your name. &gt;&gt; It's a holy thing that you had brother Brandham born. It's a holy thing that he heard a voice in a tree. It's a holy thing when you said don't drink or smoke or defile your body in any way. It was a holy thing when he began to go to the people and give his life and not even knowing where he was going. It was a holy thing when he was out in Arizona and the seven angels come. That's a holy thing that a holy God did. &gt;&gt; You know how important that is? That's the only thing that separates you from everyone else. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And for that reason and that reason alone, we are in the kingdom of God. &gt;&gt; And if you take that away, &gt;&gt; I can tell you if you took that away, I'd walk out these doors. You have no more idea. Everybody's got religion. Everybody's got Everybody sings songs the same songs we sing. Everybody prays. Everybody's sincere. Everybody gives and they tithe. And all that has nothing to do with that. It's what are you doing with the Constitution? [Music] [Applause] &gt;&gt; It's going to be 10 more minutes. I'm going to quit in Israel in the church. Brother Brandham said, "Just look at that spirit, how it rose up back there." I I I just love the way Brother Brandham can can distill something and put it into three, four lines. Amen. &gt;&gt; He said that spirit, how it rose up back there in Cain, how it came on down through Ham. How out it went through Nimrod into Babylon, out of Babylon, came on down into the days of the coming of Jesus. Amen. &gt;&gt; And he said they were teachers and they were scholars and they were wise men &gt;&gt; but they couldn't recognize him. &gt;&gt; And the same thing and has come down to this day. This is the day. &gt;&gt; Now if I can just have 10 minutes &gt;&gt; and then I'm going to close. Now that was how that other kingdom. I want to just talk a little bit more about our kingdom. &gt;&gt; The first Adam failed. So the second Adam had to come. &gt;&gt; And when Jesus was coming, he was coming for all of his citizens. &gt;&gt; And if you're sitting here today as a citizen of this kingdom, this all happened for you. &gt;&gt; And I'm reading part of your history. And the scripture says that the spirit of Elijah was on John the Baptist. &gt;&gt; And John the Baptist came and the first thing he starts out by saying, "Repent ye &gt;&gt; for the kingdom of heaven is at hand." &gt;&gt; And then Jesus came and was baptized of John in a voice from heaven saying, "Lo, this is my beloved son." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. We're starting all over again. &gt;&gt; Adam was a son. Now we have the second Adam. And a voice, "Oh God, &gt;&gt; our father in heaven spoke, &gt;&gt; this is my beloved son in whom I'm well pleased. This is the second Adam. This is the seed of the woman. This is the one that'll crush the serpent's head. &gt;&gt; This is the beginning of the creation." Notice, plays the phrase, the beginning of the creation of God. &gt;&gt; Amen. And immediately after that, notice the sequence, please. John, &gt;&gt; Jesus baptized, and the voice saying, "This is my son." &gt;&gt; The next thing that happens in your Bible is that Satan and the devil taketh him up into an exceeding high mountain. &gt;&gt; He didn't take him to a tree. He didn't take Eve to He took Eve to a tree. Says, "Look at this now. He's taking the second son of Adam. I'm sorry that he's taking the second son of God, the second Adam to a high mountain and showeth him all the kingdoms &gt;&gt; of the world. &gt;&gt; Look what I've done. &gt;&gt; Look what happened since first Adam. I came in through Cain, through Ham, through Nimrod. And look at the kingdoms of the world. Look at the power. Look at the glory. &gt;&gt; Right? &gt;&gt; Look at the wealth. Look what they've dug out of the earth. Look at the gold. Look at the gems. Look at the majesty. Look at the Look at all of these things. I'll give you all these kingdoms. And all Jesus had, he just called one man. The Holy Spirit came on one man. The one voice and he says to the people, "Repent." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The kingdom of God's at hand. &gt;&gt; Right &gt;&gt; now, it's it's it's right at hand. And then in a day or two, Jesus comes to him and is baptized of him and he rises up out of the baptism in a voice, &gt;&gt; "Behold, this is my son." &gt;&gt; That was enough to stir the gates of hell &gt;&gt; and the devil comes and takes them right up into a high mountain. &gt;&gt; Look what I've done. &gt;&gt; Look at the kingdoms of the world. And if you'll fall down and worship me, I'll give you all of this. And Jesus did said what you need to say. Get behind me, Satan. &gt;&gt; Get h Satan. &gt;&gt; He'll come to you with his whispers. He'll come to you with clear language and want you to bow to him. Bow to his system. You say, "Get hints." &gt;&gt; And if you mean it like Jesus meant it, the Bible says, "And he did. He departed for a season. [Music] And Jesus said to him, "Get hence." And then from that time, from that time, are you following the sequence I'm teaching? From that time, Jesus began to preach. Yes. &gt;&gt; Same message, &gt;&gt; same words. Jesus began to preach. &gt;&gt; What is it? The kingdom's coming. &gt;&gt; He said, repent &gt;&gt; for the kingdom of heaven is at hand. &gt;&gt; Jesus began to preach. Repent for the kingdom of heaven is at hand. I'm I'm hurry because I'm rushing out of time here. I'm rushing out of time. I meant it that way. And from those days, John the Bapt from the from the days of John the Baptist until now, the kingdom of heaven suffereth violence, and the violent take it by force. And he and then he began to heal the sick that are therein. And and he sent out the disciples, and he said, "And say unto them, the kingdom of God has come nigh to you." Soon as he sent the disciples and healings begin to take place, he he said, "The kingdom of God has come nigh to you." What happened when the prophet of God came and began to have multitudes coming and healings were taking place? What was God saying? The kingdom of God has come nigh. &gt;&gt; The message is approaching. &gt;&gt; The word is coming. &gt;&gt; The constitution is going to be made known. [Music] &gt;&gt; And he answered Matthew 13:11. And he answered and said to them, because it is given, he said to the disciples, it's given unto you that to know the mysteries of the kingdom of heaven, but to them it is not given. Then he said, verily I say unto you, there be some standing here, listen closely now, really pinch your conscience, there be some standing here, Jesus said 2,000 years ago, which shall not taste death till they see the Son of Man coming in his kingdom. The kingdom is. And when he came, he came in a changed body. &gt;&gt; And he stood right on on Mount Transfiguration in a glorified body. The kingdom of God. &gt;&gt; Let me say to you, in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ, this kingdom that I'm preaching about has a glorified body for you. &gt;&gt; Does that mean anything to you? &gt;&gt; A glorified body. We'll not have these pains and aches, brother Abe, anymore. This kingdom has a glorified body for you. [Music] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. [Music] &gt;&gt; And then Jesus said, I'm moving quickly. He says to Peter, "And I will give unto thee the keys of the kingdom of heaven, and whatsoever thou shalt bind on earth shall be bound whatsoever thou shalt bind on earth shall be bound in heaven." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And when he was demanded of the Pharisees, when the kingdom of God should come, he answered them and said, "The kingdom of God cometh not with observation." &gt;&gt; Amen. And Luke 17:21, "Neither shall they say, lo here, lo there, for behold the kingdom of God." Do you hear the words of Jesus? &gt;&gt; Do you hear Jesus here speaking to you, &gt;&gt; not me? I'm reading his words. Jesus is saying to you, the kingdom of God is within you. &gt;&gt; The mount transfiguration, his experience is within you. Amen. [Music] &gt;&gt; You are born again people. You are very very unique group. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You're in this world but as Jesus said not of this world. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; I'm no more in the world but these are in the world. &gt;&gt; And I come to thee holy father keep through thine own name. John 17:14, "I have given them thy word, and the world hateth them because they are not of the world." &gt;&gt; So many things that we engage in, so many things that take up our time and consume us. I'm just more conscious all the time. It's just this world. We deal with it as we need to, touch it as we need to, but don't become engaged with it. And above all things, don't let it affect you. Amen. &gt;&gt; It's just this world. &gt;&gt; If we live by every precept of God, God will provide. &gt;&gt; God will protect. &gt;&gt; God will heal. God will deliver. It's a part of our kingdom. I want to bring you to this deliverance. I want to bring you to this kind of miracle working power. [Music] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen. &gt;&gt; They are not of this world, even as I am not of the world. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; My kingdom is not of this world. Jesus said, if my kingdom was of this world, my servants would fight that I should not be delivered to the Jews. And Paul said, who hath delivered us? who hath delivered us from the power of darkness &gt;&gt; and hath translated us into the kingdom of his dear son. And the prophet said this in closing. And when we are born again, &gt;&gt; you are of heaven &gt;&gt; and of God. You're citizens of the kingdom of God. And the Holy Spirit that dwelleth in there that comes into you will make you act and look and think it does it. that nation where we're going to. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Well, friends, &gt;&gt; I live under the laws of Canada. You live under the laws of United States, many of you. But we're citizens. Yes. &gt;&gt; When you take your passport out and hand it to the border control officer, just remember you have another passport. &gt;&gt; That passport will never give you a transformed body. &gt;&gt; That passport can't get you out of some of the trouble that we as humans can get into. &gt;&gt; But I have another Do you know what friends? This message has plenty of power in it. It needs to be preached &gt;&gt; and preached until the people believe it. &gt;&gt; And once it once the people believe it and are committed to it, you'll see things happen amongst us you didn't even believe was possible. &gt;&gt; He's a God of the impossible. [Applause] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Glory to our great one. &gt;&gt; God bless you. Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; You believe it? &gt;&gt; Our friends from the Philippines. You believe it? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Glory to God. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. [Music] &gt;&gt; Thank you, brother Jim. I I see that that gives me gives just gives me urges me on &gt;&gt; and that's 1:00 and I said I'd close and so I'm going to close. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Let's stand. &gt;&gt; Oh, hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Why don't you turn around and shake hands with a citizen of another country, the same country you're in. Canadians can hug Americans and back and forth. We don't even belong to these countries. We belong to another country. &gt;&gt; Amen. Come, John, shake my hand. &gt;&gt; God bless you. Amen. Brother Ernie, I got to shake hands with a You're not American. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; And I'm not a Canadian. &gt;&gt; We believe it. &gt;&gt; I believe it all my heart. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. We got the same president. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Well, what should we sing? &gt;&gt; I thought I thought we'd have all kinds of songs here that All right. &gt;&gt; What is that? &gt;&gt; I pledge allegiance. &gt;&gt; All right. Wonderful. All right. Come and help me, brother. Why don't you help me, brother Kim? Can you help me with that? I pledge allegiance. My voice is gone. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Pledge allegiance to the lamb. &gt;&gt; What country are you from? &gt;&gt; Ah, &gt;&gt; in heaven. &gt;&gt; This doesn't make you happy, friends. This is the truth. &gt;&gt; This is the truth. &gt;&gt; And I want to inform you that the laws of our land can overpower the laws of our country are higher and greater than the laws. We live by the law. I believe we should live by the laws of this land. But we have a law that's greater than this law. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; I agree with it as far as it can go. Right. &gt;&gt; When they start marrying the same sex marriages here in New Westminster, I don't agree with that. &gt;&gt; Do you? No. &gt;&gt; We're with one voice. &gt;&gt; No, we don't agree with it. [Music] &gt;&gt; We're against it. &gt;&gt; Sorry, folks. &gt;&gt; That's where the law doesn't agree. And if they come here and said, "You have to you have to agree to that. You're a citizen of this country." I say, "Well, tear up my passport or do what you want. This is what I believe. And if you can find it here, I'm with you." [Music] &gt;&gt; All right. I pledge allegiance. [Music] I pledge alance to the land with all my strength. With all my I [Music] Heat. Heat. [Music] Heat. Heat. Heat. Heat. Heat. [Music] Heat. Heat. [Music] Heat. Heat. [Music] Heat. Heat. Heat. [Music] Heat. Heat. Yes. [Music] And the years have come and the years have gone of Jesus [Music] to come to this world to embrace the cross. One by one, let us die today. [Music] [Music] Heat. Heat. Heat. Heat. Heat. Heat. [Music] Heat. Heat. [Applause] Heat. Heat. [Music] and all my single [Music] to [Music] the lamb of God. The Lord my to my place and the Lord my I see his [Music] toes. [Music] [Music] &gt;&gt; I address you as citizens of another country. [Music] Not just because we had the service that we had today, but because it's in my heart. You are indeed citizens of another country. And I'm going to pray now that that will be imprinted upon your mind. And as you go about your daily life, you will confess, you will act and live under the dictates of that kingdom. May God ever lead you. Heavenly Father, our Father, which art in heaven, we say, "Hallowed be thy name. Thy kingdom come, and thy will be done on earth. &gt;&gt; And we are the ones that you have chosen that might do your will here on earth. May it be done as it is in heaven. Give us this day our daily bread, oh God. Let us not be subjected to the economies of this world. But we are subjected, oh God, and living under the blessings of your economy. Forgive us our sins and our debts, oh God, as we forgive others. This is your justice system. If we do not forgive, then are we are not forgiven. Oh God, we thank you for this glorious justice. Thank you for the blood, oh God, that has cleansed us, Father. And I pray, dear Lord, that you'll be pleased with this group of people as we will soon leave the sanctuary of this building. All of those over the internet, oh God, in the rooms, in the gatherings, wherever they might be, we speak peace to them in Jesus Christ's name. We speak blessings to them. We speak healing, oh God, to those that are sick and afflicted because this is part of the kingdom. I wonder those that are standing here in this audience, you want to raise your hand at this time. Somebody may be saying, "I'm sick." Someone else may be saying, "I need deliverance. I need peace of mind. I need to be free from this depression." Whatever it is of this other kingdom, I'm confused. Whatever it may be that's not of the kingdom of God, we have a right to banish it. Whatsoever we bind on earth shall be bound in heaven. We bind these spirits. We bind these evil works. We bind these enticements of the world. We bind this tempter in the name of Jesus Christ. Satan, you are rendered powerless before this word that I hold in my hand and before this word and this message which I hold in my heart and the people hold in their heart. And now they are strengthened. Oh God, they are instructed. I pray that the Holy Ghost will go with each one. Oh Lord, you as their teacher and as their comforter and you will lead them, Father, in all grace, I pray Jesus, as we prepare ourselves for the coming days and the camp which will soon be upon us, let this camp be like no other time. &gt;&gt; Lord Jesus, walk down these trails, into the chapel, into the kitchen. Oh God. &gt;&gt; Oh God. May people meet with you. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; May they talk with you and you talk back to them. &gt;&gt; I pray, Father, there will be a a a presence over that campground such as never has been in the times we've been there. Father granted. I pray you'll bless your people now. Bless them in their giving as they give, Father, to the Lord's work. We thank you for it in Jesus Christ's name. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. And the people said, "Amen." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; God bless you. We dismiss you in the name of Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. You want to go? You want to stay? You're dismissed in Jesus name. [Music] Nice, brother Kim. [Music] Hallelujah. Jesus [Music] Christ. [Music]
