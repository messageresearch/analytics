[0:00] to the lamb with all my strength
[0:05] with all I am. I will seek to honor
[0:13] his command.
[0:16] I pledge to I al
[0:24] let's just blend our voices now. I
[0:27] pledge
[0:29] alce
[0:31] to
[0:32] the lamb.
[0:34] With all my strength,
[0:38] with all I am, I will seek to honor

[0:48] command.
[0:50] I pledge
[0:52] alce

[1:02] &gt;&gt; Word of God speak. Word of God ever
[1:04] true.
[1:06] Hallelujah.
[1:07] What a wonderful way to start 2017.
[1:11] Pledge your allegiance to the lamb of
[1:13] God. We used to do that in schools. You
[1:15] know, we used to pledge our allegiance
[1:17] to the United States of America and down
[1:20] in the US. And you say that pledge every
[1:22] morning. It instills something within
[1:25] the citizens of the country of the
[1:26] United States. You grow up, you're proud
[1:28] of your nation. Well, I don't know if
[1:30] they actually do that in every school
[1:32] across the nation anymore. And it shows
[1:35] in the lives of the people where their
[1:37] allegiance is. They're scattered. They
[1:40] don't really have a they don't really
[1:41] have anything firm down inside them hold
[1:44] them. But we do.
[1:46] &gt;&gt; We pledge allegiance to the Lord Jesus
[1:48] Christ. Not just today and not just
[1:50] tomorrow, but we've given him our lives.
[1:53] He gave his life that we might live. And
[1:55] we're proud to stand and we're proud to
[1:57] say that our allegiance is to the Lord
[2:00] Jesus. Happy New Year. Thank you for
[2:02] being here today. We're looking forward
[2:04] to hearing our pastor speak this
[2:06] morning. So, we're just going to sing a
[2:07] couple of songs. Why don't we stand this
[2:09] morning? We'll have prayer and have the
[2:12] deacons come and take the offering. We
[2:15] just want to dedicate the day to the
[2:17] Lord Jesus.
[2:24] Is this the
[2:27] Yeah, the one on the screen. Can you put
[2:29] that up?
[2:33] Holy words long preserved
[2:38] for our
[2:41] in this world.
[2:44] We resound
[2:46] with God's heart. Oh, let the word of
[2:51] God be
[2:54] [Music]
[2:55] words of life. There words of hope.
[3:00] Give us strength.
[3:03] Help us all.

[3:14] us. Word of God. Word of God

[4:33] with all
[4:36] the word of God. Word of God.
[4:41] Word of God.

[4:49] Changing you. Lord, we have come
[4:56] all the word of God.
[5:00] [Music]
[5:04] Amen. Ask brother Tim Dodd. Brother Tim,
[5:07] if you'd come just have a quick
[5:09] testimony and one prayer request to read
[5:12] before the church. Sister Faith How
[5:14] wants to ask for a prayer for a c-orker
[5:17] who's asked for prayer for wisdom
[5:19] raising her two children. Sister Heidi
[5:22] Neighbor wants to thank all the saints
[5:24] for their prayers for me. I could feel
[5:26] your support. After months of pain, I am
[5:29] now pain-free. Our Lord is a wondrous
[5:32] healer. I give him all the praise and
[5:34] thanks. Amen. God bless you this
[5:36] morning, Sister Heidi. Amen. Good to see
[5:38] you here, Brother Tim.
[5:43] Amen. We're so thankful for that
[5:45] testimony this morning.
[5:47] &gt;&gt; Isn't our Lord wonderful?
[5:49] &gt;&gt; He's just as wonderful and more so in
[5:52] 2017
[5:54] &gt;&gt; than he was in 2016.
[5:57] We bow our heads together. How many
[5:58] would say, "Lord, make 2017
[6:02] a year that this burden on my heart gets
[6:05] answered.
[6:06] Lord, I have something that I desire
[6:08] this morning."
[6:10] Maybe you have a need physical. Maybe
[6:12] you just have something in your life
[6:13] that you just like to say, "Lord, this
[6:15] year, this I'm patient. Lord, Sister
[6:18] Heidi was patient and you came on the
[6:20] scene and you delivered her. And Lord,
[6:23] you're able to deliver, to touch, to
[6:25] bless each and everyone. Heavenly
[6:28] Father, Lord, we bow in your presence
[6:30] this morning,
[6:32] the beginning of a year. Oh God,
[6:35] we ended the year last night rejoicing,
[6:38] giving you praise and glory and honor
[6:41] for all the great things that you have
[6:43] done for us. And Lord, the end of the
[6:46] year brings that kind of a memory, oh
[6:48] Lord. Memories of victories, memory of
[6:51] battles that were won, memory, Lord, of
[6:54] how you came on the scene when we needed
[6:56] you. And we may not know what this
[6:58] coming year does hold, but we know that
[7:01] you hold the future. We know, Father,
[7:04] that we can cast our cares upon you
[7:06] because you care for us. And Lord, we
[7:09] lay all of our burdens down this
[7:10] morning. You see the hands that are
[7:12] raised, Lord, everyone. The needs that
[7:15] are in this sanctuary may be out on the
[7:17] internet. There might be some streaming
[7:19] that say, "Lord, I have need of you.
[7:21] Lord, you're no different today than you
[7:23] were yesterday, and you will be the same
[7:25] tomorrow. And so, Lord, may you come on
[7:28] the scene, granting each and every
[7:30] request. May this be a special day. May
[7:33] this be a special service that starts
[7:35] out the year, oh God, and sets the
[7:37] trajectory right, oh Lord, as our pastor
[7:40] brings a word. May you anoint him with a
[7:42] special uncction for the church. Lord,
[7:44] may you inspire him with things perhaps
[7:47] even has not he has not put into his
[7:49] notes, but Lord, you want to say
[7:50] something to your people. Here we are so
[7:53] far into the 2000s, 17 years. It's
[7:57] amazing, Lord, that we've looked for the
[7:59] marriage supper of the lamb. It may be
[8:02] just around the corner. And Lord, we
[8:04] want you to prepare us for that, oh God.
[8:07] We remember these needs, oh Lord, a
[8:10] coworker of a sister, Lord, that desires
[8:13] prayer this morning. Lord, may you come
[8:15] to her. You are wisdom, oh God. You are
[8:19] what she has need of, oh God. May she
[8:21] surrender herself to you and yield her
[8:25] life to the leadership of the Lord Jesus
[8:27] Christ. We remember Sister Leverne this
[8:30] morning also, Lord, who's not with us.
[8:32] Lord, she's had an operation. And Lord,
[8:34] we pray that you'll quickly strengthen
[8:36] her. Lord, you'll take away the pain.
[8:38] And Lord, you'll deliver her as you did
[8:40] our sister Heidi. And Lord, we commit
[8:42] all to you. Bless this service. Lord, we
[8:45] pray. We take up the first offering of
[8:48] the year. Lord, as it goes forth into
[8:51] the new year, may the needs be met.
[8:53] Lord, you don't work by money, but
[8:54] you're able to take these offerings and
[8:57] multiply them for the use in the kingdom
[8:59] of God. May you supernaturally work in
[9:02] our midst in this year like never
[9:04] before. Lord, we commit all things to
[9:07] you in this service to you in the
[9:09] wonderful name of Jesus Christ. Amen.
[9:12] Amen.
[9:14] Amen. God bless you as you have your
[9:16] seats.
[9:18] Amen. The deacons take up the offering.
[9:20] Appreciate our deacons this morning.
[9:24] Thank you, brother Martin. God bless
[9:26] you. We have uh one announcement here.
[9:30] Brother EA, you're going to be singing
[9:31] this morning. Is Brother EA here? Was he
[9:34] able to make it? You are. No, I don't
[9:36] see him.
[9:40] All right.
[9:42] Okay, Brother Wes, you got upgraded
[9:45] first class.
[9:48] You're going to have to sing twice.
[9:50] Yeah, I know. It's terrible, isn't it? I
[9:54] have a microphone and he doesn't. So,
[9:56] we're going to let you sing first and
[9:58] then we're going to have your sister and
[10:00] your brother sing with you just after
[10:01] that. That'd be all right. I'll let you
[10:04] pick the order then. Okay, good. I love
[10:07] Brother Wes. Many of you may not know,
[10:09] but uh Brother Wes and I just connected
[10:12] when I I first got saved. And uh I I
[10:16] told him I said I feel like because he
[10:18] moved to Atlanta shortly after I I got
[10:20] saved and I said uh I said I feel like I
[10:22] got robbed in broad daylight. I just
[10:25] show up here and you're gone. I couldn't
[10:28] believe it. But uh so when he's back I
[10:31] like to let him know how much I
[10:32] appreciate him and uh we'll pull on the
[10:35] gift that God has placed within him.
[10:37] Amen. Because I do believe that that's
[10:40] the way that it is. So, I have an
[10:42] announcement here for young people's
[10:44] service this Friday, January the 6th,
[10:46] for all young people ages 13 and up. It
[10:50] will be at 7:30. So, that's January the
[10:53] 6th. Um, believe the weather is supposed
[10:56] to be pretty nice, a little bit chilly,
[10:58] but uh shouldn't be any weather delays
[11:02] for this young people's service. So, I
[11:05] don't think we have any more
[11:06] announcements that I can think of. Okay,
[11:09] brother Wes.
[11:11] Matt, if you want to come and sing with
[11:13] Hannah or not with Hannah, I'm sorry.
[11:16] Your sister Leah,
[11:18] you want to sing after after brother Wes
[11:20] sings one? All right.
[11:24] You love the Lord this morning.
[11:25] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[11:44] Amen. Well, it's good to be home. Like I
[11:47] said, uh last Sunday, we just appreciate
[11:50] seeing each and every one of you and we
[11:52] just love you so much again. Uh happy
[11:56] new year to you. And uh this is a song
[11:59] that I remember listening to many, many
[12:01] times when the Lord touched my heart and
[12:03] changed my life. Um it was it's called A
[12:06] Place called Grace and I haven't sung it
[12:08] in a long time but um just just pray for
[12:11] me and I trust it'll be a blessing to
[12:13] you. Amen.
[12:15] [Music]
[12:44] For so many years
[12:47] I've heard it told
[12:54] the story of compassion.
[13:00] The prodal son
[13:02] who left the fold
[13:05] [Music]
[13:08] and felt no satisfaction
[13:15] on my knees.
[13:18] Lord, I cried out to you.
[13:23] I'm so alone.
[13:30] But if there's room
[13:33] in your house for one more,
[13:38] Lord, I'm ready to come back home.
[13:49] I know there is a place
[13:57] where arms of compassion
[14:00] welcome me home
[14:04] so mercy
[14:07] falls like rain
[14:12] and I know there's a
[14:15] [Applause]
[14:18] Call grace.
[14:23] [Music]
[14:34] For so many days
[14:37] I've trusted grace.
[14:43] Yet I had to wonder
[14:46] [Music]
[14:49] how many times
[14:52] my human strength
[14:57] has kept me from surrender.
[15:02] Oh
[15:03] the more I learn
[15:06] just to lean on the cross.
[15:10] Oh, the more that I see
[15:18] that when I fall, I will fall to the
[15:23] place where his mercy reaches
[15:29] me.
[15:32] Oh, reaches me.
[15:36] And I know there is a place
[15:44] your arms of compassion
[15:46] they welcome me home.
[15:51] Sweet mercy
[15:53] falls like grave.
[15:58] And I know there's a place
[16:02] [Applause]
[16:04] called grace.
[16:09] And when it seems
[16:12] like my courage is strong,
[16:15] there's just
[16:17] one
[16:19] one reason.
[16:24] is the rock that my faith is built on.
[16:30] He holds me in his arms
[16:33] and he gives me strength to carry on.
[16:40] And I know there is a place
[16:47] where arms of compassion
[16:50] they welcome me home.
[16:55] Sweet mercy
[16:57] falls like rain.
[17:02] And I know there's a place.
[17:08] Yes, I know.
[17:10] I know there's a place.
[17:14] Oh, aren't you glad? You know,
[17:18] I know there's a place
[17:27] called grace.
[17:31] [Music]
[17:41] [Applause]
[18:22] [Music]
[18:39] It's easy
[18:41] to walk
[18:44] in
[18:46] the footprints
[18:49] of another
[18:51] who has walked here before.
[18:58] But when those footprints
[19:02] disappear
[19:04] and my future
[19:07] seems unclear,
[19:09] my only hope is in a still
[19:15] small voice.
[19:20] Follow me when the footprints
[19:26] you followed
[19:29] are gone.
[19:31] Follow me.
[19:34] When friends leave you standing
[19:39] alone,
[19:42] don't
[19:44] be afraid.
[19:46] I won't lead you on.
[19:52] The Savior
[19:54] has spoken.
[19:56] Follow me.
[20:00] [Music]
[20:12] Oh my friend, are you troubled
[20:17] with nowhere
[20:20] to turn?
[20:22] Have you lost
[20:25] your way in
[20:27] the night?
[20:32] Well, there's one who is watching
[20:38] and he knows where
[20:40] you are.
[20:42] He wants to lead you
[20:46] into
[20:48] the light.
[20:52] &gt;&gt; Follow me when the foot
[20:58] still follow
[21:01] God.
[21:03] Follow me.
[21:06] When friends leave you standing
[21:11] alone,
[21:14] don't
[21:16] be afraid.
[21:19] I won't leave you around.
[21:24] The Savior
[21:26] has spoken.
[21:29] Follow me.
[21:33] Follow me. When the footprints
[21:38] you followed
[21:41] are gone,
[21:43] follow me.
[21:46] When friends leave
[21:49] standing
[21:51] alone,
[21:54] don't
[21:56] be afraid.
[21:58] I won't leave you alone.
[22:03] The Savior
[22:06] has spoken.
[22:08] Follow me.
[22:11] [Music]
[22:13] Don't
[22:15] be afraid.
[22:18] I won't leave you.
[22:24] [Music]
[22:26] The Savior
[22:29] has spoken.
[22:31] Follow me.
[22:37] [Music]
[22:46] Amen. Amen. We appreciate that. Brother
[22:48] Wes, Brother Matthew, Sister Leah.
[22:52] Why don't we turn the service to our
[22:54] pastor this morning? That'd be all
[22:55] right. Amen. Let's sing together.
[22:58] Blessed assurance. Jesus is mine. This
[23:01] is my story. This is my song. We'll
[23:03] invite brother Ed to come this morning.
[23:06] &gt;&gt; Blessed assure

[23:17] Oh, what a
[23:20] taste of glory.

[26:01] [Music]
[26:10] wonderful evening last night.
[26:13] &gt;&gt; We want to say not only a happy new year
[26:16] to you, but it's uh it's already a
[26:19] wonderful year.
[26:21] It was wonderful evening last night.
[26:24] &gt;&gt; I want to thank everybody for
[26:26] participating in the different groups
[26:28] that sang God bless you.
[26:31] &gt;&gt; It was just wonderful. took me back uh
[26:35] to listening to some of the singing in
[26:38] uh in different countries and it was
[26:41] just wonderful to hear the uh group from
[26:44] Philippines,
[26:46] from Africa, different places, just
[26:49] wonderful
[26:51] &gt;&gt; and I got thinking in the scripture it
[26:53] says uh every tongue.
[26:55] &gt;&gt; So there's different tongues, every
[26:57] tongue, every tribe, every nation, every
[27:01] kingdom. Hallelujah. What a time. What a
[27:04] time of rejoicing.
[27:06] We're going to have a ordination just
[27:09] now and we're going to ask brother Peter
[27:11] Ivano if he will please come and stand
[27:15] here at the front. We want to have
[27:17] prayer and we want to make some comments
[27:20] as well. If you'd come, brother Peter.
[27:23] God bless you.
[27:31] Sister Yolena is with you. Do you have
[27:35] your children as well? You do. All
[27:38] right.
[27:39] &gt;&gt; Maybe Sister Elena, if you could come.
[27:42] Do you have the boys?
[27:51] The boys are twins.
[27:57] Two of them.
[28:03] I want to read some scripture
[28:07] and brother brother Peter has been
[28:10] uh taking the responsibility
[28:13] in Seattle in Reton
[28:16] and I want to say a little bit about
[28:19] Seattle and the Reton area.
[28:22] Uh, I really believe that it
[28:26] it justifies a real lighthouse.
[28:32] I believe it should be. How many the
[28:34] congregation agree that with me?
[28:37] &gt;&gt; I really believe it does. We have
[28:39] labored there many many years before the
[28:43] present work was there.
[28:46] And uh even in the days of the radio
[28:49] when we had the radio broadcast the
[28:51] Philadelphia Bible school down there, we
[28:55] went down to show the 20th century
[28:57] prophet film.
[28:59] And um also
[29:02] they asked for a library of brother
[29:06] Brandham's books and I don't know was
[29:08] the red volumes or what it was. So we
[29:11] took that the the attitude
[29:14] that I personally have always had and
[29:17] the people I believe have had is that
[29:21] whatever door God opens that's the door
[29:23] to go through. Person wants books here's
[29:27] the books. Man needs a Bible here's a
[29:29] Bible. Need a song book here's a song
[29:32] book. Anything that can contribute to
[29:35] their spiritual life. I need it in
[29:38] another language. We'll find a
[29:40] translator, do what we can. And I think
[29:43] that that really needs to be the
[29:47] needs to be the uh spirit of the work
[29:51] there. The work in Reton
[29:54] must not be just looked on as a
[29:56] gathering place. We just gather here to,
[29:59] you know, to worship and hear a
[30:00] preacher. That's that's really not it.
[30:03] This is to be a lighthouse. Amen.
[30:05] &gt;&gt; This is to be a lighthouse to get the
[30:08] message out to the people and that's the
[30:10] message that God loves.
[30:12] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[30:14] &gt;&gt; This is the true saying.
[30:18] Uh this 1 Timothy 3 and 1. If a man
[30:21] desire the office of a bishop, he
[30:24] desires a good work. A bishop then must
[30:27] be blameless, the husband of one wife,
[30:30] vigilant, sober, of good behavior, given
[30:35] to hospitality, and apt to teach. Not
[30:38] given to wine, no striker, not greedy, a
[30:42] filthy luer, but patient, not a brawler,
[30:46] not covetous.
[30:48] One that ruleth well his own house,
[30:51] having his children in subjection with
[30:54] all gravity.
[30:56] For a man knoweth not how to rule, if a
[30:59] man For if a man know not how to rule
[31:02] his own house, how shall he take care of
[31:05] the church of God?
[31:07] not a novice, lest being lifted up with
[31:10] pride, he fall into the condemnation of
[31:13] the devil. Moreover, he must have a good
[31:16] report of them which are without, lest
[31:20] he fall into reproach and the snare of
[31:23] the devil.
[31:25] Now the prophet of God has said
[31:29] in the message indictment
[31:32] now we do not believe that gifts come by
[31:36] laying on the hands and we are going to
[31:39] lay hands on you brother Peter
[31:42] the ministers here
[31:46] we believe that laying on of hands is a
[31:50] sanction of what we've already seen
[31:55] It's an amen.
[31:57] &gt;&gt; So that's what it really is.
[32:01] In the message influence, he said the
[32:03] office of a man in the church is
[32:06] anointed. Not appointed.
[32:09] It's anointed.
[32:12] He said the church, the pastor, the
[32:14] evangelist, the prophet, the apostle
[32:18] must be the anointed office of God, not
[32:21] elected by man.
[32:24] Man tried to elect that office one time.
[32:27] They cast lots for it. Poor ma Matias
[32:32] never did nothing. But God chose Paul
[32:35] and he did something because he was
[32:37] anointed.
[32:39] &gt;&gt; That's the key.
[32:42] Why are people so tossed about? The
[32:46] prophet said in part,
[32:49] "There's about three major things that
[32:52] usually brings a minister to his back to
[32:55] the rut."
[32:57] Back to the rut. I thought that was
[32:59] quite a phrase. And noticing them, one
[33:04] of them was money,
[33:06] women, or popularity.
[33:09] And this is the three major causes that
[33:12] I see in the Bible that caused men to
[33:15] fall. And I asked our heavenly father to
[33:19] please let me shun all these
[33:23] all at all times those things especially
[33:28] these three major things and had kept a
[33:32] covering over them. That was the prophet
[33:34] himself. He prayed concerning those
[33:37] things.
[33:40] in Revelation book of symbols he said uh
[33:44] he said to see visions in part now to
[33:47] see visions and they're wonderful
[33:51] and I thank God for it
[33:54] but yet the preaching of the word is a
[33:56] million miles beyond that when I see the
[34:00] lame walk when I see the lame walk or
[34:03] the blind see the preaching of the
[34:05] gospel and I I've pondered this and I
[34:07] believe The reason that he would even
[34:10] say or be directed to say such a thing
[34:13] is that when you have a vision, it's
[34:16] usually singular. Sees a vision of a man
[34:20] or a life or a home or whatever.
[34:23] But when the gospel is preached, who
[34:25] knows where it goes? It's a scattering
[34:28] the seed and and and if someone is
[34:31] saved,
[34:33] &gt;&gt; 10,000 worlds
[34:35] &gt;&gt; has come into the kingdom. And who knows
[34:37] where that's going to go. Or young young
[34:41] men like you have as sons to see lives
[34:45] like that uh
[34:48] cultivated
[34:50] and strengthened and brought up in the
[34:52] faith. How wonderful that is. And we saw
[34:55] families last night, young men, young
[34:58] women whose parents are here in the
[35:00] congregation.
[35:02] What a glory it is. What a strength it
[35:05] is. Perhaps not everyone has that uh has
[35:10] that privilege but nevertheless we have
[35:13] the privilege to have faith.
[35:16] &gt;&gt; And if you believe
[35:18] the prophet has said that when someone
[35:22] believes and doesn't doubt then God
[35:27] God who cannot lie
[35:29] when they raise in the resurrection has
[35:31] to answer to that faith.
[35:33] &gt;&gt; I think that's wonderful.
[35:36] Don't ask me where the quote is. I've
[35:38] been looking for it for a long time, but
[35:40] I know I read it.
[35:45] And then Romans has said, and we'll
[35:47] close with this just before we pray,
[35:50] how then shall they call on him in whom
[35:54] they have not heard
[35:56] or believed?
[35:58] And how shall they believe in him whom
[36:01] they have not heard? And how shall they
[36:04] hear without a preacher?
[36:07] So that's a wonderful, wonderful thing.
[36:12] And uh we uh want to encourage you,
[36:15] brother Peter, preach the word without
[36:19] fear or favor of man. Amen. I wonder if
[36:24] the brethren if you would all come and
[36:32] would you sing a verse of that song for
[36:34] us.
[36:37] Speak my lord. Speak my lord.
[36:43] When the coal of fire had touched the
[36:47] prophet,
[36:50] making him as pure as pure
[36:54] behind.
[36:57] &gt;&gt; When the voice of God said for us,
[37:03] then he answered, "Here I am. Send me.
[37:10] Speak my Lord.
[37:14] Speak my Lord.
[37:18] Speak and I'll be waiting to answer
[37:22] thee.
[37:25] Speak my own.
[37:29] Speak my own.
[37:34] Speak and I will answer. Lord send me.
[37:41] &gt;&gt; Father Tom, would you lead in prayer,
[37:43] please?
[37:45] [Music]
[37:46] &gt;&gt; Oh mighty God.
[37:48] &gt;&gt; Father, we lay our hands to say amen to
[37:51] the call of God.
[37:54] &gt;&gt; Brother Peter has desired,
[37:56] &gt;&gt; oh God, ordination.
[37:58] &gt;&gt; He's desired this Lord.
[38:00] &gt;&gt; Brother Biscart,
[38:02] [Music]
[38:04] God say amen. A soul given
[38:08] &gt;&gt; Holy Spirit take hold of the gift
[38:11] &gt;&gt; of the world for every good gift.
[38:13] &gt;&gt; Cultivate oh God the gift from the
[38:15] father.
[38:15] &gt;&gt; May he give himself to the gift of God.
[38:19] &gt;&gt; May give himself to the ministry.
[38:23] &gt;&gt; Mighty God may see
[38:27] the purpose of the messenger and the
[38:29] message.
[38:31] &gt;&gt; Oh mighty God.
[38:34] May your thoughts be made known to him
[38:38] in the name of Jesus by the power of the
[38:40] word of God. Lord, we lay hands on him.
[38:43] But we pray that the love of God would
[38:46] descend and use and anoint the gifts of
[38:50] God within brother Peter. We're thankful
[38:52] for it
[38:54] when you call man
[38:57] Lord that you will bless our God. Lord
[39:00] as they join their lives
[39:04] and the whole
[39:06] dedication we renew this family
[39:15] we pray and the name of Jesus Christ
[39:19] would you take the vessel now
[39:22] this ordination
[39:24] would you anoint
[39:26] the glory of God we pray
[39:29] &gt;&gt; in Jesus
[39:31] Holy Spirit, use this vessel
[39:34] &gt;&gt; for the glory of God.
[39:37] &gt;&gt; Use the vessel. Use the mouth.
[39:40] &gt;&gt; Vessel of peace.
[39:42] &gt;&gt; We pray in Jesus name.
[39:46] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[39:47] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[39:49] You expect it to be different.
[39:52] God bless you, brother. God bless you,
[39:54] brother Peter. God bless your voice. God
[39:57] bless you. God bless. God bless you. God
[40:00] bless you. Speak and I'll be quick to
[40:05] answer thee.
[40:09] Speak my Lord.
[40:13] Speak my Lord.
[40:18] Speak and I will answer.
[40:22] Lord, send me.
[40:25] [Music]
[40:39] Amen.
[40:42] I think we may have been disconnected
[40:44] here.
[40:50] &gt;&gt; I'll have you turn in your Bibles to uh
[40:53] Deuteronomy the 4th chapter.
[40:59] What words?
[41:30] Are we connected?
[41:31] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[41:32] &gt;&gt; Good.
[41:34] We do this just to show we're not
[41:36] perfect.
[41:39] That should relax everybody.
[41:43] I'm going to have brother John come and
[41:45] read the scripture.
[41:48] And uh I want to read Deuteronomy the
[41:51] 4th chapter starting at verse 23. Then
[41:55] we'll read verse 25
[41:57] and 25 down through to 31. And then I
[42:02] wish to read Matthew
[42:04] the first chapter starting with verse 18
[42:09] down to 23.
[42:11] those scriptures.
[42:19] I'm going to give you a little capsule
[42:21] of of the thought I wish to approach and
[42:28] uh if you're visiting,
[42:31] I'll disregard that you're visiting and
[42:34] you can uh perhaps be benefited by
[42:37] what's being said.
[42:40] But I want to approach some very serious
[42:42] things, not within the church or within
[42:45] the congregation, but with within the uh
[42:47] bride body of Jesus Christ. And when I
[42:51] say that, I refer to whether it be
[42:53] Russia or Siberia or Europe or Africa.
[42:56] You might say, well, how do you know
[42:58] what's uh taking place over there? Well,
[43:01] we're pretty well connected and
[43:04] furthermore have have spent
[43:08] uh resources, energy,
[43:11] have spent many many days.
[43:14] Uh it might be a surprise to some of
[43:17] you, but we've spent probably close to
[43:20] two years in Africa.
[43:23] If we were to take we've made about 20
[43:25] trips there, had radio broadcast in
[43:29] Swasi music radio. You might say, "Oh,
[43:31] that's in the past." No, no, it's right
[43:33] here and it's it's part of my life.
[43:36] &gt;&gt; And we've uh we spent a lot of energy
[43:38] and the and the words that were gone
[43:41] from there. Uh perhaps brother Tom may
[43:44] have selected some of the uh tape
[43:47] sections and then we put those over
[43:51] Swansea Music Radio which is 100,000
[43:53] watt not FM but AM covering an area
[43:58] inhabited by 87 million people and it
[44:01] was there for several years. Uh we were
[44:04] on about 20 25 26 27 stations for as
[44:10] long as close to 9 years. That was every
[44:14] week. So there's been a lot of labors.
[44:18] &gt;&gt; And then you you see the the gathering
[44:21] of uh churches and people and and
[44:25] messages gone out. I've been in
[44:27] countries where people have the message
[44:30] now that did not have the message. And
[44:34] we're not talking we're not talking
[44:36] about statistics now. This is not a
[44:38] missions report. There's no such a thing
[44:40] as missions. They're bride
[44:43] uh in another country.
[44:45] &gt;&gt; That's all they are. And uh and that's a
[44:48] wonderful thing. And God came in the
[44:51] form of Jesus Christ uh who was God in
[44:56] the flesh. And I want to speak about uh
[44:59] uh I I want to speak something of that.
[45:03] But but the thing that's very very heavy
[45:05] on my heart is when I see Satan trying
[45:09] to tamper with
[45:13] uh the work of God
[45:14] &gt;&gt; and he's a he's a cunning he's a cunning
[45:17] worker. He's a cunning adversary. He's
[45:20] not our friend.
[45:22] &gt;&gt; He's an enemy.
[45:24] &gt;&gt; He's not God's friend.
[45:26] &gt;&gt; He's God's enemy. Amen.
[45:27] &gt;&gt; And whether whether we see it within the
[45:29] congregation or within the school or
[45:32] within some other country or within the
[45:34] bride as a as a whole, I uh I I you'll
[45:40] have to don't excuse me, but I get on
[45:44] the war path
[45:46] &gt;&gt; and and the weapon is the sword of the
[45:48] spirit. And so I want to convey to you
[45:52] so that uh you know in this day of
[45:55] technology we hear things and and it
[45:59] comes and it afflicts you whether you
[46:01] realize it or not. It maybe makes you
[46:04] downcast or makes you discouraged. I'm
[46:06] on the war path.
[46:08] &gt;&gt; I I He has no right to come in and
[46:11] discourage the saints of God. He has no
[46:14] place in your home and no place in your
[46:16] mind.
[46:17] &gt;&gt; All right. So, uh, brother John, could
[46:20] you come forward please and read those
[46:22] scriptures for me?
[46:23] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[46:25] &gt;&gt; Deuteronomy
[46:27] 4 verse 23-2.
[46:34] Take heed unto yourselves,
[46:36] lest you forget the command covenant of
[46:39] the Lord your God, which he made with
[46:42] you, and make you a graven image or the
[46:46] likeness of anything which the Lord thy
[46:50] God hath forbidden thee.
[46:53] 25 when thou shalt beget children and
[46:57] children's children and ye shall have
[47:01] remain long in the land and shall
[47:04] corrupt yourselves and make a graven
[47:06] image or the likeness of anything and
[47:10] shall do evil in the sight of the Lord
[47:12] thy God to provoke him to anger
[47:16] &gt;&gt; on down 26.
[47:18] I call heaven and earth to witness
[47:20] against you this day, that ye shall soon
[47:23] utterly perish from off the land, where
[47:26] unto ye go over Jordan to possess it. Ye
[47:31] shall not prolong your days upon it, but
[47:34] shall utterly be destroyed. And the Lord
[47:37] shall scatter you among the nations, and
[47:40] ye shall be left few in number among the
[47:43] heathen, whether the Lord shall lead
[47:46] you. And there ye shall serve gods, the
[47:51] work of men's hands, wood, wood, and
[47:55] stone, which neither see nor hear, nor
[47:59] eat, nor smell. I I just want to stomp
[48:03] on that. We'll read that verse again.
[48:06] And my title is, "Strange gods are
[48:10] they."
[48:12] &gt;&gt; Amen. can a a a whole nation be
[48:15] delivered out of Egypt, out of the
[48:18] cruelty of Egypt? And then when they get
[48:21] into the land,
[48:22] &gt;&gt; and and you'll raise families and you'll
[48:25] have children and you'll you'll be
[48:28] enjoying the inheritance of the land.
[48:32] &gt;&gt; That that is this was the word of
[48:35] warning from Moses here.
[48:36] &gt;&gt; Yes. and uh lest you make these gods and
[48:40] and they were the work of men's hands.
[48:43] Now I'm going to take a quantum leap in
[48:45] the service to this present day which is
[48:48] the work of men's minds.
[48:53] &gt;&gt; Science has brought the the capability
[48:57] of of of men's minds. All they have to
[49:00] do it is with a mind uh uh a mind the
[49:04] strength of their minds or the smartness
[49:06] of their minds. But then brother
[49:09] Brandham says alo also one other thing.
[49:11] He said science
[49:13] &gt;&gt; uh what has science in store for you?
[49:17] &gt;&gt; And he stops. He asks a question. What
[49:18] has science got for you in store? More
[49:21] death.
[49:23] &gt;&gt; And I will say what has been produced by
[49:26] men's minds with the technology of this
[49:29] age is far more destructive.
[49:32] &gt;&gt; Far more. Satan has one ambition that is
[49:36] to bring death
[49:38] &gt;&gt; to the people and to bring havoc and
[49:40] play havoc amongst the saints of God.
[49:43] But I also have a clear distinct promise
[49:46] that uh that the bride of Jesus Christ
[49:50] is beyond his deceptive powers.
[49:53] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[49:54] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[49:54] &gt;&gt; Amen. We believe that.
[49:56] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[49:57] &gt;&gt; Carry on, brother John.
[49:58] &gt;&gt; Verse 28 again. And there ye shall serve
[50:02] gods, the work of men's hands, wood and
[50:07] stone, which neither see nor hear, nor
[50:11] eat nor smell. But if it from then thou
[50:15] shalt seek the Lord thy God, thou shalt
[50:18] find him.
[50:19] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[50:20] &gt;&gt; If thou seek him with all thine heart,
[50:23] and with all thy soul.
[50:25] &gt;&gt; Amen. When thou art in tribulation, and
[50:29] all these things are come upon thee,
[50:31] even in the latter days, if thou turn to
[50:34] the Lord thy God, and shall be obedient
[50:38] unto his voice, for the Lord thy God is
[50:42] a merciful God.
[50:43] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[50:44] &gt;&gt; He will not forsake thee.
[50:46] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[50:46] &gt;&gt; Neither destroy thee. Amen.
[50:48] &gt;&gt; Nor forget the covenant of thy fathers,
[50:51] which he swore unto them.
[50:53] &gt;&gt; Amen. And then if you'll read in Matthew
[50:56] 1 and Matthew 1 and8
[51:12] Matthew 118
[51:16] to 23.
[51:18] Now the birth of Jesus Christ was on
[51:21] this wise
[51:23] when as his mother Mary was espoused to
[51:26] Joseph before they came together she was
[51:29] found with child of the Holy Ghost. Then
[51:33] Joseph her husband being a just man and
[51:36] not willing to make her a public example
[51:39] was minded to put her away privately.
[51:43] But while he thought on these things,
[51:45] behold, the angel of the Lord appeared
[51:48] unto him in a dream, saying, Joseph,
[51:51] thou son of David, fear not to take unto
[51:55] thee Mary thy wife, for that which is
[51:58] conceived in her is of the Holy Ghost,
[52:02] and she shall bring forth a son, and
[52:05] thou shalt call his name Jesus, for he
[52:08] shall save his people from their sins."
[52:11] Now all of this was done that it might
[52:14] be fulfilled which was spoken of the
[52:16] Lord by the prophet, saying, "Behold, a
[52:20] virgin shall be with child, and shall
[52:23] bring forth a son, and they shall call
[52:26] his name Emmanuel, which being
[52:29] interpreted is God with us."
[52:33] &gt;&gt; I'd like everyone to say, "God with us."
[52:37] &gt;&gt; God with us. the absolute with us,
[52:42] &gt;&gt; the object of worship with us.
[52:45] &gt;&gt; Amen. Thank you. You may be seated.
[52:47] Thanks, brother John.
[53:07] Some have taken it upon themselves
[53:11] to discover and point out what they
[53:14] think are flaws within the message. I'm
[53:18] getting right down where the rubber hits
[53:20] the road.
[53:26] Who has the voice and the words?
[53:30] Who has the words to form an image
[53:36] like unto God?
[53:40] And the scripture says, "And she shall
[53:43] be overshadowed by the Holy Ghost
[53:47] &gt;&gt; and shall bring forth a son, and that
[53:51] son will be virgin born." God is
[53:54] beginning a whole new creation.
[53:57] People may go thousands of years ago. I
[53:59] I'm not interested in time. I'm
[54:01] interested in what happened.
[54:03] &gt;&gt; And what happened was I Jesus was the
[54:06] beginning of the new creation of God.
[54:10] And that's why the blood that brought
[54:12] forth Jesus Christ was sufficient for
[54:15] the sacrifice and for the penalty of
[54:18] death. And it is it is our pardon.
[54:24] &gt;&gt; Just just hold on to these words. But
[54:27] who has the words?
[54:29] The scripture tells us clearly that
[54:33] Jesus
[54:35] uh Jesus himself
[54:38] even when the words of the prophets
[54:42] it says unto us a child is born a virgin
[54:46] shall conceive
[54:48] he he became that he had to believe that
[54:53] &gt;&gt; and not only did he believe that we have
[54:55] to believe that
[54:56] &gt;&gt; and we do believe that but how twisted
[55:01] the uh they they managed to man in his
[55:06] uh uh a man in his ignorance and in his
[55:10] blindness and Satan inspiring him has
[55:14] taken the blessed virgin Mary and and a
[55:17] lady elevated her to an immaculate uh
[55:21] birth and so on and so forth and
[55:24] replacing almost Christ as it was as it
[55:27] were and and Christ is the virgin born
[55:30] because he had to go to death.
[55:33] &gt;&gt; Mary didn't go to death. Mary didn't go
[55:36] to the cross. But there's a over a
[55:39] billion people that glamorize or glorify
[55:43] actually make her a goddess
[55:47] &gt;&gt; by changing the interpretation of the
[55:50] word of God. He shall he shall be the
[55:54] one. Right.
[55:56] &gt;&gt; And the scripture says he'll be called
[55:58] Emmanuel,
[56:00] which is God with us.
[56:04] &gt;&gt; Now, we have a privilege of having that
[56:06] God,
[56:08] &gt;&gt; the living God,
[56:10] &gt;&gt; the creator,
[56:12] &gt;&gt; the giver of every good gift, and the
[56:14] and the God that keeps his judgments as
[56:17] well as his promises. But I want to ask
[56:20] the question who has the voice
[56:24] and I'm just laying a very basic
[56:27] foundation here because
[56:30] uh in the in the message before the
[56:32] prophet left just before he left in the
[56:35] message I believe it is uh uh modern
[56:39] events made clear by the prophecy
[56:42] he meets the two men on the way to Emmas
[56:47] and uh And brother Brandham says, "Would
[56:49] you like to hear what he said?"
[56:54] &gt;&gt; Did you ever catch that?
[56:56] &gt;&gt; Would you like to hear? Would you
[56:59] sitting here today would like to hear
[57:01] what he said to the two men
[57:04] &gt;&gt; as he began to quote his life out of the
[57:07] scripture?
[57:08] And he quoted
[57:11] uh he quoted out of uh Psalms 22 and1.
[57:15] He cried at the cross, "My God, my God,
[57:18] why hast thou forsaken me?"
[57:20] In Psalms 22:17,
[57:23] I may tell all my bones that they look
[57:26] and they stare at me. Uh in Isaiah 9
[57:31] and6, unto us a child is born, and a
[57:34] virgin shall conceive and so forth. And
[57:38] unto us a child is born. And the
[57:40] scripture actually says, "Unto us a son
[57:42] is given. The government shall be upon
[57:45] his shoulders. And his name shall be
[57:47] called wonderful counselor, the mighty
[57:50] God, the everlasting father, the prince
[57:52] of peace." And also in Psalms 20, this
[57:57] is what brother Brandham is is repeating
[58:00] in Psalms 22:18.
[58:02] They parted his garments among them.
[58:06] Psalms 8 and and they parted my garments
[58:10] among them. This is what the scripture
[58:11] says. And cast my lot and cast lots upon
[58:15] my vesture. Isaiah 7 and4 a virgin shall
[58:19] conceive. Psalms 22 and 7 and 8 made him
[58:24] they mocked by his enemies. uh he his uh
[58:29] supposed to be friends, his enemies, the
[58:32] church. In Psalms 22 again, not a bone
[58:36] was to be broken, but they pierced his
[58:39] hands and his feet. In Isaiah 53 and 12,
[58:43] he died with male factors. In Isaiah
[58:46] 53:9,
[58:48] bruised and burned, I'm sorry, bruised
[58:51] and buried with the rich brother. In
[58:54] Psalms 16 and10, he was resurrected from
[58:58] the dead. David said, "So, I will not
[59:01] suffer my holy one to see corruption,
[59:05] neither will I leave his soul in hell.
[59:08] He was raised from the dead." Malachi 3,
[59:11] John the Baptist was his forerunner.
[59:15] And uh and and and he he continues on
[59:18] all of these scriptures. Now my question
[59:20] to this congregation and all who are
[59:23] streaming or listening is who is
[59:26] authorized to give those words that
[59:30] actually shaped and formed this one that
[59:34] it says and now God is with us.
[59:38] And then as time went on, he had some
[59:41] disciples
[59:43] and uh and uh then he comes to the
[59:45] garden of Gethsemane and the crowd
[59:47] comes.
[59:49] They're not his friends.
[59:52] They have become his enemies. Perhaps
[59:54] those that even were in his healing
[59:57] meetings.
[59:59] And now he has these people that have
[1:00:03] risen up against him and deci his he has
[1:00:06] close friends. He has a disciple by the
[1:00:08] name of Peter and he raises this takes
[1:00:10] his sword out and he's going to kill
[1:00:13] somebody.
[1:00:14] &gt;&gt; He's not going to just cut off
[1:00:16] somebody's ear. He he was aiming for
[1:00:19] something more than his ear. I can
[1:00:22] assure you. And when you get across, you
[1:00:24] can ask him just to make certain. I I I
[1:00:28] believe that he was going to split that
[1:00:30] guy right down the middle.
[1:00:32] But Jesus said, "Put up your sword. They
[1:00:37] that live by the sword will die by the
[1:00:39] sword." And and uh he says, "And then
[1:00:43] how how else will the scriptures be
[1:00:45] fulfilled?"
[1:00:48] &gt;&gt; His life was not only being shaped by
[1:00:52] the word, but he was allowing it to be
[1:00:54] shaped by the word. Amen.
[1:00:59] &gt;&gt; You got that far.
[1:01:01] &gt;&gt; He was He was submitting himself.
[1:01:04] &gt;&gt; Put up your sword. We're not here to
[1:01:06] defend ourselves.
[1:01:08] &gt;&gt; We're not here to, you know, toh uh
[1:01:12] escape the hardships that have been
[1:01:15] promised. In other words, we give
[1:01:17] ourselves to the molding and the
[1:01:19] shaping. And thus the scripture could
[1:01:22] say he was the image of the invisible
[1:01:25] God.
[1:01:27] &gt;&gt; Now we have God. Now we have an image of
[1:01:30] God.
[1:01:32] &gt;&gt; And if I ask that question, I want to
[1:01:34] ask a second question. Who has the words
[1:01:38] or the authority?
[1:01:41] And where did their authority come from
[1:01:44] to say, "Oh, well, we don't believe
[1:01:46] that. We believe something else." and
[1:01:48] and uh we're we're departing the
[1:01:50] message. Fine, go their way.
[1:01:53] &gt;&gt; But I say now, what's going to shape
[1:01:56] them into a bride of Jesus Christ?
[1:02:01] &gt;&gt; What form?
[1:02:03] &gt;&gt; What form do they expect to come in?
[1:02:06] &gt;&gt; And and will now this God that they have
[1:02:10] are shaping
[1:02:11] because they say, "Well, uh I have
[1:02:14] certain thoughts." Now you folks have to
[1:02:16] stay with me.
[1:02:18] &gt;&gt; I have certain thoughts. Well, who are
[1:02:19] you?
[1:02:21] &gt;&gt; Who am I?
[1:02:22] &gt;&gt; Who's a preacher?
[1:02:24] &gt;&gt; Who some wise person? Well, we we get on
[1:02:27] the internet and we can discover things.
[1:02:29] Get on the internet. What a tool of
[1:02:32] Satan. You're going to get on a tool of
[1:02:34] Satan, an advancement of science, and
[1:02:37] you think you're going to find out
[1:02:39] something about the truth. Let's get
[1:02:41] real.
[1:02:42] The truth is here in God's word
[1:02:46] &gt;&gt; and he was full of truth and grace and
[1:02:49] truth and that and and this is the
[1:02:52] absolute
[1:02:53] &gt;&gt; it's absolute truth.
[1:02:56] &gt;&gt; You know, you talk about simple uh
[1:03:01] I I I may raise some things that you'll
[1:03:03] have to ponder very very deeply. I had a
[1:03:06] I had a minister who's a pastor may be
[1:03:09] preaching this morning. He called me
[1:03:12] after I preached about the great the big
[1:03:15] brown bear vision and I spoke it for a
[1:03:19] purpose so that you would know that
[1:03:24] incidentally
[1:03:26] I'm going to just say something say it
[1:03:28] plainly
[1:03:31] I w I was there I have people speaking
[1:03:34] about it and telling all about it and
[1:03:36] they weren't even there
[1:03:40] You folks are privileged.
[1:03:43] &gt;&gt; You have an eyewitness.
[1:03:44] &gt;&gt; I was there.
[1:03:48] &gt;&gt; And I held that for many, many, many,
[1:03:50] many years.
[1:03:54] And what was what took place and the
[1:03:57] storm and the rain and the storm that
[1:03:59] left and so on. I had a a pastor call me
[1:04:02] and he said, "Can a prophet prophesy
[1:04:06] something in the name of the Lord?" and
[1:04:09] then it doesn't happen.
[1:04:12] He said, "I I I just want I understood
[1:04:16] you spoke on it." Yeah, I did. I said,
[1:04:20] "Well, I'll send it to you. I I've held
[1:04:22] it and kept it for many, many years, but
[1:04:25] I'll send it to you." And uh but to
[1:04:29] answer your question, I said, "Uh Jonah
[1:04:31] did."
[1:04:33] Yeah.
[1:04:36] &gt;&gt; Now you're looking at me like you've
[1:04:37] never read about Jonah.
[1:04:40] &gt;&gt; Jonah went into Nineveh and he said, "In
[1:04:43] 40 days, this thus sayeth the Lord,
[1:04:46] &gt;&gt; 40 days this city will be destroyed."
[1:04:50] &gt;&gt; It wasn't.
[1:04:52] &gt;&gt; Well, someone says, "Well, because they
[1:04:53] repented." But that's the that didn't
[1:04:56] say that if they repented, it wouldn't
[1:04:58] be destroyed. He said it would be
[1:05:00] destroyed. And it was a prophecy by a
[1:05:02] prophet and it didn't happen.
[1:05:09] &gt;&gt; You want to hear the rest of this?
[1:05:15] Who has the who has the words? And who
[1:05:19] would be foolish enough in this
[1:05:21] congregation or in any congregation to
[1:05:25] submit their lives
[1:05:27] to the words of whoever
[1:05:31] to shape their life?
[1:05:34] And fact is if it happens to be a word
[1:05:37] of doubt, how is doubt going to shape
[1:05:40] your life?
[1:05:42] And if you think for a moment that your
[1:05:44] life isn't being shaped, it is.
[1:05:47] &gt;&gt; Something is shaping your life.
[1:05:50] &gt;&gt; And then you'll end up either an image
[1:05:52] of God
[1:05:53] &gt;&gt; or an image of uh an unknown image
[1:05:57] because because I can tell you that men
[1:06:01] now my heart is burning. See, uh I can
[1:06:04] tell you that men women say, "Well, I
[1:06:07] don't know about this and I'm kind of
[1:06:09] turning. I'm not a believer like I'm not
[1:06:11] committed like you folks are or whatever
[1:06:14] more. What are they
[1:06:16] &gt;&gt; and what shape what kind of form are
[1:06:19] they going to take? What kind of image
[1:06:22] are they going to are they going to be a
[1:06:26] image of the bride of Jesus Christ? And
[1:06:29] I'm asking who has the authority to
[1:06:34] shape that bride? Now here's the subtle
[1:06:37] here's the subtility.
[1:06:39] Say well if we only going to be a church
[1:06:43] anybody can be a church. You say well we
[1:06:47] have music we have choir we have uh you
[1:06:53] know we have missions or we have singers
[1:06:57] or we have whatever more. And these
[1:07:01] things can take the same place, can take
[1:07:05] the same shape. So they say, well, this
[1:07:08] is the same shape as that. And and uh if
[1:07:12] if that's all it is, but it has to be
[1:07:15] something more than than just a church.
[1:07:22] &gt;&gt; All right. Want as little movement as
[1:07:24] possible.
[1:07:35] Words
[1:07:37] actually shape lives.
[1:07:40] And I'm down the road quite a ways. And
[1:07:42] I don't want anyone to tamper with my
[1:07:45] testimony.
[1:07:47] I don't want anyone to tamper with my
[1:07:50] life. Don't want anyone to try to bear
[1:07:54] an influence on on your life either.
[1:07:59] We're not here to become lax.
[1:08:03] &gt;&gt; We're not here to become
[1:08:05] uh uh shall I say just casual and
[1:08:10] restive and relaxed about things. Now,
[1:08:14] you know, you might as well just uh uh
[1:08:18] I'm not just preaching here, but I'm
[1:08:20] preaching elsewhere also.
[1:08:24] And you'd be surprised where we get
[1:08:26] emails from. and questions from.
[1:08:30] And so I want to just deal with some
[1:08:32] things so that people will know
[1:08:36] we're not we're not casual about the
[1:08:38] message.
[1:08:44] &gt;&gt; We're not just building a church around
[1:08:46] a message.
[1:08:48] We're not going to just bear the name or
[1:08:52] identification
[1:08:54] as being uh you know where we're we're
[1:08:59] followers but we're not really committed
[1:09:03] to uh uh we we don't want to be too
[1:09:07] fanatical about things. I want to take
[1:09:09] the message exactly as it says
[1:09:13] &gt;&gt; and and if people have uh h have uh
[1:09:16] questions about it, well fine, then they
[1:09:18] can go and establish their own doctrine
[1:09:22] and their own. Now,
[1:09:29] do you know what denominations are?
[1:09:33] There are people who have this Bible
[1:09:38] &gt;&gt; in their pulpits
[1:09:40] &gt;&gt; and in their shelf
[1:09:43] and but but they don't quite agree with
[1:09:47] what it says or they don't see what it
[1:09:51] says. Now, if somebody wants to talk
[1:09:53] about the visions of Malachi 4 or
[1:09:56] visions that brother Brandham had, let
[1:09:59] let me tell you something.
[1:10:01] you go to Ezekiel and you interpret
[1:10:04] Ezekiel for me first.
[1:10:07] &gt;&gt; And when you've got that done, then then
[1:10:10] I then you'll have an ear you'll have my
[1:10:12] ear to I'll at least listen to you. But
[1:10:15] until you can go to Ezekiel, it it's
[1:10:18] I've read Ezekiel recently and I don't
[1:10:22] know exactly what he's saying
[1:10:24] because he's up in some other who who
[1:10:27] said that I have to be able to
[1:10:29] understand him and then people and
[1:10:32] theologians and everything and they go
[1:10:34] and do all kinds of research. You can't
[1:10:38] research and find out. And furthermore,
[1:10:40] let me make a statement. You can't take
[1:10:43] the
[1:10:45] God who is eternal with no beginning and
[1:10:48] no ending. Let me stop there.
[1:10:51] &gt;&gt; People are going to figure out God
[1:10:53] first. Tell me, do you understand
[1:10:56] something that's without beginning
[1:10:58] &gt;&gt; and without end?
[1:11:01] &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham says, he says, you
[1:11:02] can't even figure out a blade of grass
[1:11:06] &gt;&gt; and they're going to understand the
[1:11:07] creator
[1:11:09] &gt;&gt; of all things.
[1:11:11] Let's be real friends and let's just say
[1:11:13] God is God
[1:11:16] &gt;&gt; and he does what he pleases to do and he
[1:11:19] says how he wants to say it and all he
[1:11:22] looks for and all all we have to do is
[1:11:25] commit ourselves to believing and
[1:11:28] &gt;&gt; saying well I I'm just a believer
[1:11:32] &gt;&gt; say well that's very very dangerous I
[1:11:35] don't think so I don't think so because
[1:11:39] God is God You're not going to turn
[1:11:42] nations around. They're going in a
[1:11:44] certain direction. And and uh uh you
[1:11:47] know, if we could just change things,
[1:11:49] we'd change things in Syria right away.
[1:11:51] For uh I'm I'm not pleased that people
[1:11:54] are suffering on the other side of the
[1:11:56] world, but it happens to be a reality.
[1:11:58] I'm not I'm not happy that innocent
[1:12:01] children are being killed. I'm not
[1:12:03] interested. Uh I'm I'm very interested,
[1:12:06] but I can't change that. Can you?
[1:12:08] &gt;&gt; No. you're sitting here today, children
[1:12:12] are being burned and so on under bombs
[1:12:16] and all of these things. We can't change
[1:12:18] that, but we have to believe that it's
[1:12:20] happening.
[1:12:21] &gt;&gt; It's in the news. So, it's happening.
[1:12:24] &gt;&gt; Am I being too plain?
[1:12:32] &gt;&gt; But but
[1:12:34] there's something that is uh critical
[1:12:37] here. And the critical part is
[1:12:41] we talk about a rapture
[1:12:46] uh
[1:12:50] who's going to go on a rapture a bride
[1:12:54] who is going to shape this bride.
[1:12:59] If God in his wisdom, if God in his
[1:13:03] mercy, if God in his extended mercy
[1:13:07] sends um a Malachi 4, which we believe
[1:13:11] in, sends a Malachi 4
[1:13:16] with such a word. That word didn't come
[1:13:19] just idly to adjust our lives. That word
[1:13:23] comes to shape our lives. And when we're
[1:13:26] done being shaped and formed
[1:13:31] and in that is why that is why I am so
[1:13:35] obsessed by seeing that the word of God
[1:13:39] has preeminence because it's the only
[1:13:42] tool and the word of God is the only
[1:13:45] tool. And if and if that is God's tool,
[1:13:49] you can be absolutely certain. Satan
[1:13:52] wants to adjust it so it won't be quite
[1:13:55] as accurate.
[1:13:58] &gt;&gt; You follow me?
[1:14:00] &gt;&gt; And so that we don't end up being
[1:14:02] exactly what God desires us to be.
[1:14:06] &gt;&gt; God has given us a thus sayaith the Lord
[1:14:10] and his purpose. his purpose and his
[1:14:13] purpose is to have that word do the
[1:14:17] molding, do the forming, do the shaping.
[1:14:21] And if someone raises their mind above
[1:14:24] that, then then they are uh giving
[1:14:27] themselves the uh the privilege. I I
[1:14:31] wouldn't say it's a privilege, but they
[1:14:33] are taking to themselves that that they
[1:14:36] can shape with their own minds the way
[1:14:41] their life should be. And listen
[1:14:44] friends, I've lived a long time
[1:14:47] &gt;&gt; and I have I've seen people you wouldn't
[1:14:49] believe the mess that people get into.
[1:14:53] Absolute disastrous mess
[1:14:57] &gt;&gt; because they're going to do it by their
[1:14:59] own self. by their own mind. I'm going
[1:15:02] to I'm going to direct my own self to be
[1:15:05] happy. I'm going to direct my own self
[1:15:07] to do certain things. And they disregard
[1:15:10] the scripture. Listen friends, without
[1:15:13] the scripture, your life is headed for
[1:15:16] disaster.
[1:15:23] &gt;&gt; So, I'm going to just take my time. Yes.
[1:15:25] Amen.
[1:15:28] &gt;&gt; So I asked the question, who has the
[1:15:32] words
[1:15:33] or the that can form a bride for Jesus
[1:15:39] Christ
[1:15:41] and dare a corruptible human mind?
[1:15:45] Corruptible human mind.
[1:15:48] And friends, we have minds that are very
[1:15:52] degraded outside of the word of God. the
[1:15:55] mind. Satan is absolutely
[1:15:58] uh uh ready and present to sew seeds of
[1:16:02] doubt
[1:16:04] &gt;&gt; and even just a doubt. Now I'm I'm going
[1:16:06] to I'm going to ask some very specific
[1:16:09] questions
[1:16:10] and here's one of them
[1:16:15] and I have observed this.
[1:16:18] If somebody
[1:16:20] sews a doubt in a person's mind,
[1:16:24] what they're actually doing is taking
[1:16:25] away your absolute.
[1:16:30] &gt;&gt; They've removed the absolute. Now, where
[1:16:33] is the absolute?
[1:16:35] Well, if it's not here precisely, I
[1:16:38] could have taken time to be very very
[1:16:41] specific about uh certain uh maybe
[1:16:44] certain
[1:16:46] parts of life, but you you can fit it to
[1:16:49] yourself and they remove your absolute
[1:16:54] then then what this is what creates such
[1:16:58] confusion. Well, maybe it's here. Oh,
[1:17:00] may maybe it's over there. No, maybe
[1:17:03] it's here. Maybe it's with this group.
[1:17:04] No, maybe it's with this group. Maybe
[1:17:06] it's with that group.
[1:17:08] &gt;&gt; Where's the absolute? The absolute, the
[1:17:12] only absolute that we have is the word
[1:17:14] of God.
[1:17:16] &gt;&gt; I've listened to
[1:17:20] I've actually labored with people
[1:17:24] who only listen to tapes.
[1:17:29] You know what? They don't listen to the
[1:17:31] tapes.
[1:17:33] They play the tapes,
[1:17:36] &gt;&gt; but they don't listen to the tapes.
[1:17:39] &gt;&gt; They don't do what the tapes say. Are
[1:17:42] you sitting listen now? A lot of people
[1:17:45] read the messages. I got all of them
[1:17:48] there. And I I love them and have them
[1:17:52] marked up, but I can tell you that
[1:17:54] there's things on those books, things
[1:17:57] that I read in those books, and they're
[1:18:00] sharp tools.
[1:18:02] It's a very sharp tool because when I
[1:18:05] read it, I realize I don't just need to
[1:18:08] read this, but I need to submit myself
[1:18:12] &gt;&gt; to it.
[1:18:13] &gt;&gt; I need to submit myself. I need to
[1:18:15] submit myself so that my life can be
[1:18:18] shaped.
[1:18:20] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:18:20] &gt;&gt; Because the word we say the word is
[1:18:24] Jesus Christ. So if we are kind of
[1:18:28] holding back from having Jesus Christ
[1:18:32] shape our lives, who's going to shape
[1:18:34] it?
[1:18:36] all somebody and and they've
[1:18:41] said all kinds of things and
[1:18:46] become uh
[1:18:49] well I don't know if I have you know
[1:18:54] I I'm going to be I'm going to be very
[1:18:57] very blunt today
[1:19:01] people become very very not only casual
[1:19:05] But well, what do you believe? Well, I
[1:19:07] don't know what I believe. Excuse me.
[1:19:10] &gt;&gt; You don't know what you believe.
[1:19:12] &gt;&gt; And where are you headed?
[1:19:14] &gt;&gt; Well, uh,
[1:19:17] where am I headed?
[1:19:20] The the country is full of it.
[1:19:23] &gt;&gt; The world is full of it.
[1:19:25] &gt;&gt; People are aimless.
[1:19:27] &gt;&gt; People are are without without
[1:19:30] direction.
[1:19:31] Your neighbors are that way. You're Your
[1:19:34] peers are that way. Other people that go
[1:19:37] to school with you or go to university,
[1:19:39] they don't have they don't have the
[1:19:41] answer. So, are you going to submit your
[1:19:43] life to someone who doesn't have the
[1:19:46] answer?
[1:19:48] &gt;&gt; I'd say not. That wouldn't be wise.
[1:19:51] &gt;&gt; That's true.
[1:20:04] So now there had to be there has to be
[1:20:07] one that could fulfill
[1:20:13] all the prophecies, all the things that
[1:20:15] were spoken
[1:20:18] of Jesus Christ. And then he said right
[1:20:21] when it come and he's facing he's facing
[1:20:24] probably the most difficult. He's facing
[1:20:27] the cross. He's facing the suffering.
[1:20:31] He's facing the death. He's facing all
[1:20:33] of those things. And his friend doesn't
[1:20:35] want him to endure that.
[1:20:39] But he says this scripture which I have
[1:20:42] here. I'll read it later. But how then?
[1:20:46] How then will the scriptures be
[1:20:48] fulfilled?
[1:20:50] He's not even talking about how his life
[1:20:52] but he he was the person who could
[1:20:55] fulfill it and he was the person who
[1:20:58] would fulfill it because he was giving
[1:21:01] himself to it. Now we can come to church
[1:21:04] here. We can come to church. We can have
[1:21:06] all the fellowship. We can uh join in
[1:21:09] all the activities and be accepted and
[1:21:12] all the rest of it. But it takes more
[1:21:14] than that. It takes something more than
[1:21:17] that. And that's not I'm not preaching
[1:21:19] something you have to do. I'm just
[1:21:22] saying if you do it, that's the only way
[1:21:24] to have your life shaped.
[1:21:29] &gt;&gt; Now, quite a few of you graduated from
[1:21:32] school, graduated from high school,
[1:21:36] and you're
[1:21:39] I'm right down where you live. Some of
[1:21:42] you have graduated from school and
[1:21:44] you've got decisions to make. Now what
[1:21:46] will I do? Which direction am I going to
[1:21:48] go etc? What is the best place for uh me
[1:21:53] to put my energies and uh and my studies
[1:21:56] and so on. Well, what do you want to be?
[1:22:00] So you imagine I want to be a mechanic
[1:22:02] or I want to be a carpenter or I want to
[1:22:05] be a housewife or I want to be whatever
[1:22:09] whatever. And you you make a choice and
[1:22:13] then you will start to do some study.
[1:22:18] Don't say I'm wrong because I'm not
[1:22:19] wrong.
[1:22:21] You'll do some studying and and you'll
[1:22:24] need to apply yourself.
[1:22:27] give yourself to it and your life will
[1:22:30] be shaped
[1:22:31] &gt;&gt; by what you study. And those words on
[1:22:34] the book are going to come into your
[1:22:37] life and you're going to make it
[1:22:39] practical if you're going to get
[1:22:41] anywhere and you're going to become if
[1:22:43] you're going to be successful, you're
[1:22:45] going to have to let those words shape
[1:22:47] your life.
[1:22:49] &gt;&gt; I want to just say something to you. If
[1:22:51] you plan to go to heaven,
[1:22:53] &gt;&gt; you better let these words shape your
[1:22:55] life.
[1:22:57] [Applause]
[1:23:00] And you better know what it says.
[1:23:03] &gt;&gt; You need to know what it says.
[1:23:05] &gt;&gt; I need to know what it says. So, I'm not
[1:23:08] taking my time up here lightly. I I I
[1:23:11] feel that there are things that need to
[1:23:14] be said and and it's not it's not a uh
[1:23:20] it's not a private matter that people
[1:23:23] you know they today they get all all use
[1:23:27] all the tactics and all the blogs and
[1:23:30] all the rest of it. I don't have time
[1:23:32] for it. People you want to say well I'm
[1:23:35] ignorant. I'm thankful I'm very
[1:23:36] ignorant. I I just by accident I come
[1:23:40] across too much stuff and I and when I
[1:23:43] do see some stuff I think what would
[1:23:46] happen if some of you young people read
[1:23:48] that.
[1:23:50] &gt;&gt; What would happen? It's not going to be
[1:23:52] healthy for you.
[1:23:55] &gt;&gt; I've talked to some of you and you say,
[1:23:57] "Well, I've I've read this and it's left
[1:24:00] me discouraged." Of course, it leaves
[1:24:01] you discouraged.
[1:24:04] And furthermore, it leaves you in a
[1:24:06] state you don't know what to believe.
[1:24:12] &gt;&gt; And I will say this that the it's much
[1:24:15] easier on the flesh
[1:24:18] to go the way that Satan offers you.
[1:24:23] But it is a
[1:24:25] it's not a lifechanging experience.
[1:24:29] Your life takes on no form at all.
[1:24:33] no form. It just, you know, flows with
[1:24:36] goes with the flow sort of thing.
[1:24:51] I want to take
[1:24:54] we're only having one service and I'm
[1:24:55] not going to keep you long, but I want
[1:24:58] to uh get across some things. Is that
[1:25:00] all right?
[1:25:02] Thank you.
[1:25:09] I'm going to just go quickly for a few
[1:25:12] moments
[1:25:13] uh because I want to I want to get past
[1:25:15] some things here.
[1:25:18] You know, the first one to ever give a
[1:25:20] prophecy,
[1:25:22] you know, the first one that ever gave a
[1:25:24] prophecy was God himself.
[1:25:27] &gt;&gt; And here's the prophecy.
[1:25:30] and he's speaking. This is going to
[1:25:32] shock you. He didn't give it to a
[1:25:35] believer. He didn't give it to a
[1:25:36] prophet. He didn't give it to him. He
[1:25:38] gave it to the serpent. The first
[1:25:41] prophecy was given by God to the
[1:25:43] serpent. In other words, he prophesied
[1:25:46] to the devil himself what he was going
[1:25:48] to do. And he says, "Now I'm going to
[1:25:50] put enmity between you and the woman."
[1:25:56] &gt;&gt; And between your seed and her seed.
[1:25:59] You know, anyone who wants to argue
[1:26:01] about the serpent's seed. Figure that
[1:26:03] one out. I just want you to tell me who
[1:26:06] the who who the serpent seed. Here's God
[1:26:09] who can't lie talking to the serpent
[1:26:12] saying, "I'm going to put enmity between
[1:26:14] you and the woman."
[1:26:15] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:26:17] &gt;&gt; And between her seed. Yes.
[1:26:19] &gt;&gt; And your seed
[1:26:21] &gt;&gt; tutfony.
[1:26:23] &gt;&gt; That's the end of it.
[1:26:25] &gt;&gt; Figure that one out.
[1:26:29] &gt;&gt; And then he says, "And you will bruise
[1:26:34] and it shall bruise thy head, and thou
[1:26:36] shalt bruise his heel." Who's going to
[1:26:39] fulfill that?
[1:26:41] Well, uh,
[1:26:44] I I don't want to just preach a happy
[1:26:47] time for you out of the Bible. I want to
[1:26:50] preach some things that you have to
[1:26:53] really deal with. So God gave that
[1:26:56] prophecy.
[1:26:58] Jesus Christ
[1:27:00] was the only one who conquered death.
[1:27:06] &gt;&gt; Is the only one who crushed the head of
[1:27:09] the serpent. Amen.
[1:27:10] &gt;&gt; I'm building.
[1:27:13] He's the only one who defeated the devil
[1:27:17] and is the only one who fulfilled every
[1:27:19] word.
[1:27:21] And that was where Jesus said in Matthew
[1:27:23] 26 and it was at Gethsemane. He said,
[1:27:26] "But how then shall the scripture be
[1:27:29] fulfilled?" He's asking a question. And
[1:27:32] I want to ask a awaiting congregation of
[1:27:35] people.
[1:27:37] We could talk about the rapture and we
[1:27:40] believe in it. We can speak about the
[1:27:43] change of the bodies and we can believe
[1:27:45] on it. But I say I want to say to you,
[1:27:49] who is going to inherit that? Who's
[1:27:53] going to inherit those scriptures? And
[1:27:55] there are things that you know things
[1:27:58] that is not negative necessarily but
[1:28:01] there are things that the prophet of God
[1:28:03] has spoken which cause me to think very
[1:28:07] very deeply and he says there'll be few.
[1:28:10] &gt;&gt; There'll be very few
[1:28:14] and I could get up and sing the chorus
[1:28:16] real quickly. I'm one of the few.
[1:28:19] But that won't do it in itself.
[1:28:22] It's one there are things. So that then
[1:28:24] I start asking myself and I've got it
[1:28:26] written down here friends.
[1:28:29] What is the bride going to fulfill?
[1:28:33] &gt;&gt; He's already fulfilled his part.
[1:28:36] &gt;&gt; He said, "How else will the scripture be
[1:28:38] fulfilled? I'm prepared to go all the
[1:28:40] way." Are you prepared to go all the
[1:28:42] way? We can sing about it. All the way.
[1:28:44] All the way. I'm prepared to go all the
[1:28:46] way. But now we have to uh come to grips
[1:28:49] in this world.
[1:28:51] What I see taking place in this world
[1:28:54] really I agree I have to agree I say
[1:28:59] amen is a devil's world.
[1:29:02] &gt;&gt; This is a devil's world. And I have to
[1:29:06] agree with the prophet of God when he
[1:29:08] says every every government
[1:29:13] &gt;&gt; is of the devil
[1:29:16] &gt;&gt; and education is of the devil. Not that
[1:29:19] two and two equals four. He's not
[1:29:21] talking about that kind of education.
[1:29:23] Learn and get all that you can and use
[1:29:26] all that you can for the kingdom of God.
[1:29:31] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:29:33] Can you still say amen?
[1:29:34] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:29:57] Now God spoke
[1:29:59] says that he might present himself
[1:30:06] a glorious church
[1:30:09] not having spot or wrinkle
[1:30:12] or any such thing, but that it should be
[1:30:17] holy and without blemish. Now, that's
[1:30:21] not a group of people that's going to
[1:30:23] try to make themselves holy. Try to make
[1:30:26] themselves He's already said it.
[1:30:29] &gt;&gt; He's already spoken it.
[1:30:31] &gt;&gt; So, the equipment is all in place.
[1:30:34] &gt;&gt; All we need to do is material as
[1:30:37] material is just submit and give
[1:30:40] ourselves to it.
[1:30:45] I'm going to take you now. I'm I'm just
[1:30:48] going to take you into some You'll have
[1:30:50] to stay with me. I'm going to take you
[1:30:52] into some thoughts. I know exactly what
[1:30:54] I'm doing. I know exactly how I'm
[1:30:57] presenting this to you,
[1:31:01] but I want you to think about some
[1:31:02] things.
[1:31:06] Says, "Strange gods are they."
[1:31:11] And he said, "Thou shalt make no grave
[1:31:13] in image."
[1:31:18] And he said, "Ears they have but they
[1:31:21] don't hear.
[1:31:23] Eyes they have but they don't see."
[1:31:26] And we are sitting here as living
[1:31:28] creatures. We have eyes. We have ears.
[1:31:32] And we are going to need a God
[1:31:35] &gt;&gt; that hears and sees. and a God that
[1:31:39] speaks
[1:31:40] &gt;&gt; and speaks truth
[1:31:43] &gt;&gt; so that our lives will be shaped
[1:31:47] &gt;&gt; according to the author's plan. And
[1:31:50] brother Bram talks about Michelangelo
[1:31:53] and the years that he took to make a
[1:31:56] make an image to Moses as Moses. And it
[1:32:02] was so real and that he struck the image
[1:32:05] and cried out speak
[1:32:07] &gt;&gt; because it was so much like the image
[1:32:12] of Moses.
[1:32:14] I have a I have a quote here I'll come
[1:32:18] to and and brother Brandon was talking
[1:32:20] about the bride
[1:32:22] becoming so much like the bridegroom
[1:32:28] &gt;&gt; that the two are actually one. Yes.
[1:32:32] &gt;&gt; She's so much like it.
[1:32:35] &gt;&gt; Tell me folks, what word is going to
[1:32:38] shape the bride?
[1:32:42] &gt;&gt; What word is it? And uh
[1:32:47] how much are we going to give ourselves
[1:32:49] to it? I've spoken to people about the
[1:32:52] message.
[1:32:54] They they don't know it. Plain don't
[1:32:56] know the message at all. But it is a
[1:33:00] message.
[1:33:02] What would you do if your children
[1:33:05] I think now brother Mr. Tatch you're
[1:33:09] going through some studies. I've talked
[1:33:13] to others of you that are doing advanced
[1:33:15] studies
[1:33:17] and you tell me
[1:33:20] when I ask you how are you doing says
[1:33:23] well it's pretty hard it's difficult
[1:33:31] you know I have a bit of a problem and
[1:33:34] we're wanting to get from this life to
[1:33:37] another life but we'll study much harder
[1:33:41] you tell me if it's True. We'll study
[1:33:43] much harder for a job
[1:33:47] or some further education.
[1:33:50] &gt;&gt; You'll give much more time to that than
[1:33:52] we even give trying to get to heaven.
[1:33:57] &gt;&gt; Is it so?
[1:34:01] &gt;&gt; Is that the way it should be?
[1:34:04] &gt;&gt; Or is should there be a change?
[1:34:07] &gt;&gt; And what kind of a change? Is it going
[1:34:09] to come easy? Well, it may not come
[1:34:11] easy. Will it take will it take some
[1:34:14] devotion? Will it take some deep
[1:34:17] consideration? I think it will.
[1:34:20] &gt;&gt; I really think it will.
[1:34:32] In the rapture message, I'll just I'm
[1:34:34] going to just read this and see why I
[1:34:37] have it here. But in the sight of God,
[1:34:40] the bride is justified
[1:34:42] in the sight of God. She never done it
[1:34:46] in the first place.
[1:34:50] You know what, friends?
[1:34:52] I've pondered that real deep.
[1:34:56] I pondered it real deep because there
[1:34:58] isn't a man, woman, or young person.
[1:35:02] There isn't a man, woman, or child that
[1:35:04] when they read that don't have things in
[1:35:07] their mind that God who spoke it doesn't
[1:35:10] have in his mind.
[1:35:15] Isn't that the truth?
[1:35:19] And you are made to remember,
[1:35:22] caused to remember
[1:35:24] things that are are are have a a a have
[1:35:30] a decided effect upon your life. And I
[1:35:33] say to you in the name of Jesus Christ,
[1:35:36] that needs to end.
[1:35:40] &gt;&gt; You say, "Well, how will it end?" I
[1:35:42] don't know.
[1:35:44] But I'm going to I'm going to give you a
[1:35:46] little personal testimony here in a few
[1:35:48] moments
[1:35:50] of what I believe that we as a
[1:35:52] congregation need. I believe that
[1:35:54] believers of this message need I really
[1:35:57] believe they need it and mass whatever
[1:36:00] whatever uh whatever God can do in their
[1:36:04] life. I really believe it's ne necessary
[1:36:07] and that is that there is a there is a a
[1:36:11] place
[1:36:13] and I pondered this very very deeply
[1:36:17] and I'm taking my deliberate time.
[1:36:21] There is a place there's an element
[1:36:25] where we go beyond
[1:36:29] this is the Bible but I need to go
[1:36:32] beyond the Bible not in its words not in
[1:36:35] its saying but in what the purp what is
[1:36:39] the purpose of this Bible it come to
[1:36:41] make known to me an invisible God
[1:36:46] and the purpose of it is that I will
[1:36:49] have a connection with that God
[1:37:00] &gt;&gt; know that's exactly what people need
[1:37:04] that you have a connection. Why did God
[1:37:07] send
[1:37:10] William Brandham? Why did he send him?
[1:37:13] Why did he send any prophet? It was
[1:37:16] actually to bring the people back to
[1:37:18] God. But why did he send a messenger of
[1:37:22] our time? Why did he send it?
[1:37:25] Well,
[1:37:28] I had some rare opportunities. I had
[1:37:31] some rare rare privileges.
[1:37:34] I have an email on my phone right now
[1:37:37] all the way from South America.
[1:37:42] And a man is in need,
[1:37:44] in desperate need, and he's crying out
[1:37:47] for deliverance.
[1:37:50] Satan is
[1:37:52] has played havoc with his life
[1:37:57] and he's bound
[1:37:59] and he's he he's even spoken about I
[1:38:04] think he's a businessman sounds like a
[1:38:06] professional man and the only reason I'm
[1:38:09] mentioning it is because it's current
[1:38:10] it's right now
[1:38:13] and he speaks about the only thing that
[1:38:15] he really has as an option is suicide
[1:38:19] He must have deliverance
[1:38:21] from this
[1:38:23] way of life.
[1:38:26] What led him there?
[1:38:29] But he's he's he he'sard of a testimony
[1:38:31] and something that took place in the in
[1:38:34] the prophet's life and you were there.
[1:38:36] He said you were there and I would like
[1:38:39] to hear what is it that brought the
[1:38:42] deliverance and brought the release.
[1:38:44] That's what I need. So he's identified
[1:38:46] that and that's right. That's as of now.
[1:38:50] But now I'm talking about that that's
[1:38:53] fine for a brother. I trust that he will
[1:38:55] have that. But now now when we have a
[1:38:57] congregation of people, we come here to
[1:38:59] church and we sing and we pray and we do
[1:39:02] things and we have our activities and we
[1:39:04] do things and we have things over at the
[1:39:06] school and we do things. We have things
[1:39:08] at the camp and we're preparing things
[1:39:11] all the time. And friends, I I I I'm
[1:39:14] happy for the activity, but it has to go
[1:39:16] beyond activity.
[1:39:19] &gt;&gt; There's something that is, and brother
[1:39:22] Ben Brandon calls it sometimes a
[1:39:24] something.
[1:39:26] &gt;&gt; There's something that's inexplainable
[1:39:29] because it's from another realm. But I
[1:39:31] want to bring it to you.
[1:39:36] I personally believe
[1:39:39] that
[1:39:41] and you help me now, but I personally
[1:39:45] believe that there is a capability
[1:39:48] within the bride of Jesus Christ.
[1:39:55] If you are a member of the bride of
[1:39:57] Jesus, if you're called
[1:40:00] to be in the bride of Jesus Christ,
[1:40:04] then there is a a
[1:40:09] you say, well,
[1:40:12] just stop there a moment. I want to come
[1:40:14] to I'll I'll just take the woman at the
[1:40:17] well first.
[1:40:19] And what led me here is because brother
[1:40:22] Brandham spoke about two worlds.
[1:40:28] And now we have a man
[1:40:31] who said,
[1:40:33] "I'm standing I'm standing in two worlds
[1:40:36] right now."
[1:40:39] No prophet
[1:40:41] in the scripture ever said that.
[1:40:47] And now God has given you a prophet that
[1:40:52] said, "I'm standing between two worlds
[1:40:55] right now. I'm standing in two worlds."
[1:40:58] And it just tears me up
[1:41:01] because of what I see. I see this person
[1:41:04] maybe 20 years ago, 30 years ago, or in
[1:41:07] the future see things taking place. And
[1:41:10] then if this continues on and continues
[1:41:13] on, I'm in in in visions and in in in in
[1:41:17] one world and and then he said it gets
[1:41:18] to the place where I don't know where
[1:41:21] I'm at.
[1:41:24] You don't have a you don't hardly have a
[1:41:26] prophet say that. You brothers know
[1:41:29] that. It's what he said.
[1:41:33] I I'm I'm I'm coming to a point, but
[1:41:35] it'll take me a few moments.
[1:41:38] So he said, "Now I'm in in two worlds.
[1:41:43] When I read that, I'm I'm I'm I'm
[1:41:47] gripped by it. See, I don't have to get
[1:41:50] into a whole bunch of doctrinal things
[1:41:52] and what he said and how he said it and
[1:41:54] what does it mean this and then it
[1:41:56] doesn't mean that and then get into some
[1:41:58] man's mind of opinion of what he said. I
[1:42:01] don't want anything to do with that. I I
[1:42:03] I don't need that because that's not
[1:42:05] going to get me anywhere. But whatever
[1:42:08] whatever this man whatever this prophet
[1:42:10] of God is saying, I I believe with all
[1:42:13] my heart he's in two worlds.
[1:42:16] &gt;&gt; And the reason I believe that is because
[1:42:18] then he begins to speak in this world
[1:42:23] to the individual,
[1:42:25] what he's receiving from another world
[1:42:29] and what he gets from another world. He
[1:42:32] speaks to that person over and over
[1:42:34] says, "Raise your hand. Is that true?"
[1:42:36] and they raised their never once no one
[1:42:39] said it no it's not true it's always
[1:42:42] true
[1:42:43] &gt;&gt; so what I'm conveying to you is I
[1:42:46] personally want to be connected with
[1:42:48] that place
[1:42:49] &gt;&gt; where the truth comes
[1:42:51] &gt;&gt; and now we have a vessel
[1:42:54] &gt;&gt; that is in touch with this world and in
[1:42:57] touch with another world and now I'm
[1:42:59] becoming this vessel
[1:43:04] which is called Jesus Christ got weary.
[1:43:10] This vessel which we called William
[1:43:13] Brham. I don't know you've never met
[1:43:15] him. I did.
[1:43:18] He would get weary.
[1:43:21] This vessel Jesus Christ would get
[1:43:23] hungry.
[1:43:26] He would get thirsty. So he was on a
[1:43:29] certain journey but he had to go a
[1:43:31] certain place. He had to go to Samaria.
[1:43:34] It happens to be a scripture that the
[1:43:37] angel of the Lord directed brother
[1:43:39] Brandham to
[1:43:42] &gt;&gt; because it was one that was going to use
[1:43:44] all the time and he used it many many
[1:43:47] times.
[1:43:49] &gt;&gt; Why? What effect does that have on us?
[1:43:52] Said he was directed by an angel of God
[1:43:56] to use that. That must have some effect
[1:43:58] on me because this is a messenger to me.
[1:44:01] What kind of a message is this giving
[1:44:03] it? What kind of a signal is this
[1:44:05] sending me? So he starts talking about
[1:44:07] the woman at the well and I begin to
[1:44:11] ponder her again yesterday and today
[1:44:14] yesterday.
[1:44:18] So now
[1:44:23] she's a Samaritan
[1:44:26] and he's sitting on the well.
[1:44:30] And he says,
[1:44:32] "Get give me to drink
[1:44:35] cuz he's thirsty.
[1:44:37] He's a man. He's thirsty. That's this
[1:44:40] world.
[1:44:42] Here's the well. Here's a woman. Here's
[1:44:44] a man. That's all in this world.
[1:44:47] Why am I saying? Why am I even talking
[1:44:49] this way? You might even wonder where
[1:44:52] it's going.
[1:44:55] But we're not interested in staying in
[1:44:57] this world.
[1:44:58] &gt;&gt; If time goes on, there isn't going to be
[1:45:00] one of you left here.
[1:45:03] You're not going to live that long.
[1:45:06] &gt;&gt; Believe me, I know
[1:45:09] you're not just not going to live that
[1:45:11] long.
[1:45:13] And then and then what?
[1:45:17] And then where?
[1:45:21] &gt;&gt; So I want to ask you where are you going
[1:45:23] to be?
[1:45:24] &gt;&gt; And that's what a person has to come.
[1:45:26] These people are wise and they got all
[1:45:29] kinds of things that's you know all
[1:45:31] kinds of questions and they've got their
[1:45:33] own ideas and so on. Just come back in
[1:45:36] another come back in a hundred years and
[1:45:38] tell me
[1:45:41] &gt;&gt; what what are they going to have? So
[1:45:42] this woman at the well now
[1:45:46] he says uh
[1:45:49] give me to drink. It's all this world.
[1:45:55] He said if you knew who it was if you
[1:45:57] knew the gift of God
[1:45:59] you would ask me
[1:46:02] and I'll give you to drink and you'll
[1:46:05] never thirst again. Says sir give me
[1:46:09] this water.
[1:46:12] Jesus says, "Go and get your husband."
[1:46:18] Now, she comes to a part of her life
[1:46:20] that she's not proud of. She said,
[1:46:23] "Well, uh, I don't have a husband."
[1:46:27] And that would be an answer for a lot of
[1:46:29] people.
[1:46:31] I don't have a husband. And he said,
[1:46:33] "Well, that's right. What you've said is
[1:46:35] exactly right.
[1:46:38] But you've had five.
[1:46:42] And brother Bon says her eyes are
[1:46:44] flashing now. You've had five and the
[1:46:47] one that you have now is not your
[1:46:49] husband.
[1:46:51] Sir,
[1:46:54] now she's being pulled into another
[1:46:56] realm. Sir,
[1:46:59] I perceive I perceive
[1:47:02] something is working here. I perceive
[1:47:05] you are a prophet.
[1:47:08] That still isn't good enough.
[1:47:11] He's still a man. He's now he's a
[1:47:13] prophet, but he's still a man.
[1:47:19] And and and
[1:47:21] this should mean something to you. Now
[1:47:23] he they turn religious. There's there
[1:47:26] are people even in this day that are
[1:47:29] happy to talk to you about the message,
[1:47:32] &gt;&gt; happy to talk to you about church,
[1:47:34] &gt;&gt; happy to talk to you about their church.
[1:47:36] But you can't have a thing to do with
[1:47:38] their church because you don't know what
[1:47:40] they believe.
[1:47:42] &gt;&gt; You don't know what's going to shape
[1:47:44] your life.
[1:47:45] &gt;&gt; Whatever is being taught is going to
[1:47:47] shape your life.
[1:47:50] &gt;&gt; That is why you need to give yourself to
[1:47:54] the word of God.
[1:47:56] &gt;&gt; Give yourself to psychology. Give
[1:47:58] yourself to something else and that's
[1:48:00] what you'll be. But if you give yourself
[1:48:03] to an a word that is proven to be a true
[1:48:07] word and a word that actually comes from
[1:48:10] another place. Say you don't have to be
[1:48:13] very smart to say one thing for sure. I
[1:48:16] want to go to another place.
[1:48:18] &gt;&gt; One thing is certain. I want to go
[1:48:21] wherever that kind of answer comes from.
[1:48:24] I was in the midst of a lot of
[1:48:26] confusion. I was in the midst of a lot
[1:48:29] of uh real trouble in my life and I
[1:48:32] spoke a word that resolved it.
[1:48:36] &gt;&gt; Friends, that's the source I want to
[1:48:39] hang on to.
[1:48:41] &gt;&gt; That's the source I want to be a part
[1:48:42] of. And now she had a she has another
[1:48:45] kind of confusion. And the confusion is
[1:48:48] not about her marital status any longer.
[1:48:52] Her confusion is about well
[1:48:56] worship.
[1:49:01] &gt;&gt; We the Samaritans, we say and she'd been
[1:49:04] taught that we need to worship in this
[1:49:07] mountain.
[1:49:09] And the Jews say we should worship in
[1:49:12] Jerusalem.
[1:49:14] Now she's getting close, isn't she?
[1:49:16] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:49:16] &gt;&gt; And she got the right desire. She wants
[1:49:18] to know
[1:49:22] And he says,
[1:49:24] "Uh, well, salvation's of the Jews." And
[1:49:28] we know, we know because being a Jew,
[1:49:34] and he wasn't a Jew, we know that.
[1:49:37] But he says,
[1:49:39] and and it's what she said now. She
[1:49:42] said, "I know that when the Messiah
[1:49:44] comes, when the Messiah's come,
[1:49:48] he will tell us all things.
[1:49:51] Now friends,
[1:49:53] here's where
[1:49:58] I'm coming right to the very razor edge
[1:50:01] of something and I hope you can get it.
[1:50:07] &gt;&gt; Don't struggle too hard.
[1:50:10] But when he said, "I that speak to thee
[1:50:15] am he."
[1:50:18] Now, don't read anything into my books.
[1:50:21] Don't read anything into my message. But
[1:50:23] when he said, "I that speak to thee am
[1:50:26] he,"
[1:50:28] that's where something took place.
[1:50:31] And she realized
[1:50:34] she realized that
[1:50:37] this was the this was her answer. And
[1:50:40] she reached out. Now, an unseen force
[1:50:44] had done something. Amen.
[1:50:47] &gt;&gt; The reason I'm talking to you is I know
[1:50:48] exactly what that is.
[1:50:54] &gt;&gt; When a pillar of fire
[1:51:00] came into the car
[1:51:02] and the prophet of God is saying, "I I I
[1:51:05] I'm the same place that woman was. I was
[1:51:09] I was I had a lot of discouragement, a
[1:51:12] lot of failure in the in the wonderful
[1:51:17] believers. Oh, could we fellowship?
[1:51:19] Yeah. Well, wonderful fellowship. Could
[1:51:22] we visit each other's home? Absolutely,
[1:51:24] we did. We did. We hug each other. We
[1:51:27] hugged each other. We shook hands. We
[1:51:31] wept together. We had the Lord's table
[1:51:33] together. We did all of those things.
[1:51:37] But somehow there was still something
[1:51:39] that was missing. Is it in Jerusalem or
[1:51:42] is it in in the mountain? Do you have to
[1:51:44] be a Samaritan or do you what do you
[1:51:46] have to do?
[1:51:48] &gt;&gt; And now now something I'm caught into
[1:51:50] something. And she was at a well. I was
[1:51:52] in a car.
[1:51:58] What What do you think of this ministry,
[1:52:01] brother Ed? Brother Eddie, he said, "Do
[1:52:06] you think it could be that of Elijah the
[1:52:09] prophet
[1:52:13] as is foretold in the in the scripture
[1:52:16] and Genesis and Revelation and so on?"
[1:52:18] Then his vase voice just trailed off and
[1:52:22] I hung my head.
[1:52:27] This is a part that's too confusing to
[1:52:30] me yet. I can't understand it. I can't
[1:52:33] sort it out. Listen, friends, when you
[1:52:36] get right down to I'm talking about
[1:52:38] where the real rubber hits the road,
[1:52:41] where we have to assess our lives in in
[1:52:44] the spiritual aspect. Not not just
[1:52:47] coming to church, not just singing a
[1:52:49] song, not just hearing watch night
[1:52:51] service, not just that. It's it can be
[1:52:54] that, but it can be so much more
[1:52:55] blessed.
[1:52:58] And the invitation
[1:53:00] is out for believers because I want to
[1:53:03] say to you within the message, you can
[1:53:06] say it's in a tape or it's in a book or
[1:53:08] it's in a a disc or whatever form. I
[1:53:12] don't care what form it's in. I am here
[1:53:15] telling you there's an element
[1:53:17] &gt;&gt; in that message
[1:53:19] &gt;&gt; that your soul
[1:53:21] &gt;&gt; cries out for
[1:53:23] &gt;&gt; and that you need
[1:53:25] &gt;&gt; to get from this place to that place
[1:53:31] &gt;&gt; and that is what you must pursue
[1:53:35] &gt;&gt; whether it's at an altar
[1:53:37] &gt;&gt; I don't say whether it's at home whether
[1:53:39] it's in your car whether it's in your
[1:53:42] business.
[1:53:44] &gt;&gt; But all I can tell you, it's a real
[1:53:46] element.
[1:53:48] &gt;&gt; It's a reality.
[1:53:50] &gt;&gt; And I want to go a step further. It is a
[1:53:52] person.
[1:53:54] &gt;&gt; And it is the person of Jesus Christ.
[1:53:56] &gt;&gt; I don't know what figure you have, what
[1:53:58] shape you have of Jesus Christ. What do
[1:54:01] you think of him going in long flowing
[1:54:04] gowns and walking along the shores of
[1:54:06] Galilee? I don't. It's not my business
[1:54:10] to say how you view him, but I can tell
[1:54:13] you that so many many that come to
[1:54:16] church don't have that understanding of
[1:54:19] him. He's what you need as an
[1:54:21] individual. And you should you should
[1:54:24] stop at nothing
[1:54:26] &gt;&gt; until you have that because someday
[1:54:29] someday
[1:54:30] &gt;&gt; you're going to need him.
[1:54:35] Yeah.
[1:54:38] &gt;&gt; And I want to make another statement.
[1:54:41] If you make that kind of contact, and I
[1:54:44] would stop at nothing until you I would
[1:54:46] urge you to stop at nothing till you
[1:54:48] have made that kind of contact. And once
[1:54:51] you make that kind of contact and you
[1:54:54] know that this is a person
[1:54:58] when you even bow your head and say
[1:55:03] whether it's over the table or as I did
[1:55:06] this morning I said father
[1:55:09] it's different
[1:55:12] it's not some feeling out of the emotion
[1:55:15] it's something that you know it's
[1:55:16] something you've experienced I know
[1:55:19] you're my Father,
[1:55:22] &gt;&gt; it's not because I'm old and and you're
[1:55:25] young. It's not that I was young once
[1:55:29] also,
[1:55:31] but I experienced him in some simple
[1:55:33] ways. And I knew one thing. I knew one
[1:55:37] thing. And friends, I'm pouring my
[1:55:40] life's blood out to you right now. I
[1:55:42] know one thing. Whether it's a god that
[1:55:45] just raised a little flower out of the
[1:55:47] out of the woods and as I would walk
[1:55:50] through the woods and sees the little
[1:55:51] flower I just stand there and weep
[1:55:54] because I knew it was my God
[1:55:57] &gt;&gt; that created that and I'm here able to
[1:56:00] enjoy it.
[1:56:02] &gt;&gt; I knew that something was different.
[1:56:04] When I see the mountains or see the
[1:56:06] streams or see something it is it is
[1:56:09] that something people feel connected
[1:56:11] with nature. It's more than feeling
[1:56:14] connected with nature. You're being
[1:56:16] connected with the one who made the
[1:56:18] nature, one who made the all of the
[1:56:22] things, whether it be the streams and
[1:56:24] all of these things. And I understand
[1:56:26] people today wanting to be connected
[1:56:29] with nature. I feel a connection with
[1:56:31] with nature and with creation and so on.
[1:56:35] It's more than that. You have to have a
[1:56:36] connection with the creator
[1:56:40] &gt;&gt; himself. And once you have that,
[1:56:44] the Bible's different.
[1:56:47] &gt;&gt; The message is different.
[1:56:49] &gt;&gt; Believers are different.
[1:56:51] &gt;&gt; So I go to a message church
[1:56:55] and that's different.
[1:56:57] You just feel different about it. You
[1:56:59] come and you're different. And people
[1:57:01] say, "Well, I I
[1:57:05] you know, they they maybe admire a
[1:57:07] certain part of your life." And I know
[1:57:08] what it is they're admiring. I really
[1:57:11] do. I really do because it's an
[1:57:14] abstract. It's a part that you can't
[1:57:17] define.
[1:57:24] And so I said I said to brother Benham,
[1:57:29] I don't know for for all I would know.
[1:57:32] I said I I I and I think I'm talking
[1:57:35] like the woman was to Jesus.
[1:57:39] For all I know, it must be. It has every
[1:57:43] appearance of being.
[1:57:46] And
[1:57:49] a being.
[1:57:52] People say, "Well, well, did you see
[1:57:53] it?" No, you're in the wrong channel.
[1:57:57] If I could see it, it wouldn't be real.
[1:58:00] &gt;&gt; Well, how did you know? Well, I mean,
[1:58:03] how do I know I'm beside you? I I I I
[1:58:06] look at your face. I have some senses
[1:58:09] that tell me that I'm there. But you
[1:58:11] know, you know, even science has proven
[1:58:14] that you could get you can be around you
[1:58:16] can be in an elevator and there's all
[1:58:18] kinds of conversation going place and
[1:58:20] elevator doors open and and in stops uh
[1:58:23] in comes another stranger and suddenly
[1:58:26] nobody has anything to say. people
[1:58:28] looking at their watches because they
[1:58:31] feel the subconscious
[1:58:33] and they are because there's a a aura
[1:58:35] there's a presence all I can tell you
[1:58:39] you cannot
[1:58:41] friends I'd love to go down to your seat
[1:58:43] and tell you you cannot be in his
[1:58:46] presence
[1:58:47] &gt;&gt; without feeling him
[1:58:50] &gt;&gt; you cannot be in his presence without
[1:58:52] feeling like you're going to die
[1:58:56] &gt;&gt; you can't be in his presence is
[1:59:00] till you're so touched. Now you're
[1:59:03] talking to you're you are right beside
[1:59:06] the one who brought you and gave you
[1:59:08] life.
[1:59:09] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:59:11] &gt;&gt; And then you find out that he has a he
[1:59:14] has a purpose in your life.
[1:59:18] You know friends,
[1:59:21] some of the most precious things I can't
[1:59:23] tell you about
[1:59:26] because they're so precious.
[1:59:29] I wouldn't want them be to be doubted.
[1:59:34] But there isn't anybody here that
[1:59:36] wouldn't want the same thing to happen.
[1:59:39] Have you ever been in a dilemma? You
[1:59:41] know what I mean by a dilemma? Have you
[1:59:44] ever been in a time where you don't know
[1:59:46] where you can go forward or backward or
[1:59:49] have you been Have you experienced those
[1:59:50] times?
[1:59:55] Have you experienced those times?
[1:59:58] &gt;&gt; It just seems like the whole world,
[2:00:01] you've experienced those times. I'm
[2:00:03] going to tell you something.
[2:00:06] I stood right on this platform not far
[2:00:09] from where Tom is sitting.
[2:00:14] this last year
[2:00:16] and I was in a an incredible insoluble
[2:00:20] problems
[2:00:22] so many problems
[2:00:24] I didn't know what more to do
[2:00:30] deep problems
[2:00:32] difficult insoluble problems
[2:00:35] what is the answer where is the answer
[2:00:39] say well God is the answer Christ is the
[2:00:41] answer. Yeah, I know he's the answer,
[2:00:44] but he seems silent. Have you ever been
[2:00:46] there?
[2:00:48] When he's been silent,
[2:00:52] I tell you, when he works,
[2:00:55] when he does something, when he takes a
[2:00:57] step, he can cause things to just turn
[2:00:59] to ether
[2:01:01] &gt;&gt; and they disappear.
[2:01:04] &gt;&gt; And I stood right there where Brother
[2:01:06] Tom is at the close of a service.
[2:01:11] I'm talking about reality now. I I
[2:01:14] realize this is a service and this isn't
[2:01:16] a customary service and this isn't the
[2:01:18] way I usually preach, but I knew where I
[2:01:21] was coming to. I want to get right down
[2:01:23] where you live. I want to get right down
[2:01:26] where some of you young men and young
[2:01:28] ladies and so on.
[2:01:31] I've had such a I've been burdened the
[2:01:33] last few days
[2:01:38] because I've been harboring this.
[2:01:42] I know he's real. I know he's so real.
[2:01:45] There isn't a young person here. There
[2:01:47] isn't a man or woman here.
[2:01:50] And I'm holding this in my heart
[2:01:53] and people come into my office and they
[2:01:56] they're seeking answers
[2:01:59] and I know what the answers are. I
[2:02:00] haven't got time to kind of bring people
[2:02:03] to this place. But it is this this
[2:02:05] element that's in the message, this
[2:02:07] element that's in the word of God. How
[2:02:11] how was it that Jesus could do so many
[2:02:14] miracles and feed thousands of people
[2:02:16] and with the bread? Who who can
[2:02:20] I'm baffled. How do you get around a
[2:02:22] miracle like that? How How is it those
[2:02:25] people aren't following him?
[2:02:28] &gt;&gt; How is it those people where are they at
[2:02:30] the cross? Yeah.
[2:02:34] &gt;&gt; And after these ministries and after all
[2:02:36] of this effort of getting the message
[2:02:38] out and to getting people and churches
[2:02:41] are formed and pastors and preachers and
[2:02:43] all these things and then have a prophet
[2:02:46] listen to me, friends.
[2:02:48] &gt;&gt; You better listen to He says, "There'll
[2:02:51] only be few."
[2:02:56] &gt;&gt; Well, I I don't know what few means.
[2:03:00] I don't know how many is, but I know one
[2:03:02] thing. I want to be one of those.
[2:03:06] &gt;&gt; And if I want to be connected with that,
[2:03:09] then I better be connected now. And and
[2:03:12] that's why the message came is to
[2:03:14] connect us
[2:03:16] &gt;&gt; with that
[2:03:17] &gt;&gt; to let you know it's more than just a
[2:03:20] song. It's more than clapping your
[2:03:22] hands. It's more than a good sermon.
[2:03:24] It's more than having this physical
[2:03:27] things. It's more than a well. and more
[2:03:30] than a water and more than a bucket and
[2:03:32] more than being thirsty. It's more than
[2:03:35] being confused. It's more than having
[2:03:37] five husbands and more than living with
[2:03:40] one now, more than all of that. It was
[2:03:43] just there was the answer was right
[2:03:45] there sitting on the well, but she had
[2:03:48] to get connected with another place
[2:03:51] &gt;&gt; and then acknowledge it and give herself
[2:03:54] to it.
[2:03:55] &gt;&gt; And that's why the message has come.
[2:03:58] &gt;&gt; Amen. It's not just a bunch of books,
[2:04:01] friends. It is not just a bunch of
[2:04:03] books. You can sit here forever and
[2:04:05] thinking it's a bunch of books or a
[2:04:07] bunch of tapes or a bunch of quotes. I
[2:04:10] get sick of that because there's so much
[2:04:12] more. I I I can my wife can tell you I
[2:04:16] can I can sit over two or three pages in
[2:04:20] a message because I'm having a a an
[2:04:24] interaction
[2:04:27] with the one who was giving himself
[2:04:32] to this vessel, this prophet
[2:04:36] to show to these people
[2:04:39] to bring it in such a way and in such
[2:04:41] simplicity.
[2:04:44] And with what people perceive as
[2:04:46] mistakes, I think, oh my goodness, you
[2:04:50] haven't even you're not even in the
[2:04:51] right ballpark.
[2:04:53] &gt;&gt; You're not even on the right planet.
[2:04:57] &gt;&gt; He even did those things for his own
[2:05:01] reasons. And it's not for us to try to
[2:05:04] figure out what his reason is. He just
[2:05:06] does it because he's God.
[2:05:09] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:05:10] Are you with me?
[2:05:21] &gt;&gt; And that's the reality.
[2:05:24] I think that's the key. That's the
[2:05:25] secret.
[2:05:28] And you might say, and I don't want to
[2:05:30] be necessarily flooded, but I'm trying
[2:05:33] to make it as plain to you as possible.
[2:05:36] There's a certain characteristic within
[2:05:39] the message. And one day you'll find
[2:05:42] out, you know what? This is a person.
[2:05:46] This is a person. This is a person that
[2:05:49] I I really love. I don't just sing,
[2:05:52] Jesus, I love you.
[2:05:54] &gt;&gt; But this is a person that now.
[2:05:58] And that person comes and tells you.
[2:06:03] He tells you things that you need to
[2:06:05] hear
[2:06:07] &gt;&gt; and he told me things as I stood right
[2:06:10] on this platform here and I'm giving
[2:06:13] that testimony at the beginning of this
[2:06:15] year. I was happy to know that this was
[2:06:19] the Lord's day. I want to use this Lord
[2:06:23] today to honor him and say Lord Jesus
[2:06:26] say to you people you talk to me
[2:06:31] and you took some took real things
[2:06:35] matters of life that were insoluble
[2:06:38] and the wisest people of this world
[2:06:40] couldn't give me the answer.
[2:06:44] You go to the finest people and like you
[2:06:48] say you've been to a doctor.
[2:06:50] Yes. Yes. Yes, I've been to a doctor and
[2:06:53] he told you this and told you that. Yes.
[2:06:55] Yes. Raise your hand. That's true. Yes,
[2:06:57] that's true. That's fine. But that's not
[2:06:59] enough.
[2:07:01] &gt;&gt; They got to hear an answer coming from
[2:07:03] another place and give themselves to
[2:07:06] that answer because friends, one day
[2:07:10] you're going to need that connection to
[2:07:13] go from this place to that place.
[2:07:16] &gt;&gt; And you want to live in that place.
[2:07:20] you want to live in that place.
[2:07:23] &gt;&gt; And in the automobile, in the car when
[2:07:27] he was he was there
[2:07:33] and you may not know or understand.
[2:07:36] We're just driving. Brother Brandon's
[2:07:38] driving. That's this world
[2:07:40] to drive around a curve. That's this
[2:07:43] world. I have a gun. That's this world.
[2:07:45] I'm a hunter. That's this world. There
[2:07:48] stands a great big animal right in the
[2:07:50] middle of the road.
[2:07:56] Some power from another world made him
[2:07:59] stand there. His creator made him stand
[2:08:01] there.
[2:08:06] And now this vessel, this prophet of
[2:08:08] God.
[2:08:10] I said, "Oh, there's a moose. Stop
[2:08:13] brother Brandon. I'll get him." because
[2:08:15] he was an easy shot from there. Stop and
[2:08:18] I'll get him. No, no, his voice is
[2:08:21] heavy.
[2:08:23] It's okay.
[2:08:24] It's all right, Brother Eddie. Just get
[2:08:26] your gun and your bullets. It's all
[2:08:28] right. And he keeps driving
[2:08:31] within about 30 m,
[2:08:34] 30 yards
[2:08:36] of that animal and stops.
[2:08:40] And I step out and shoot that animal.
[2:08:42] Then I'm worried. Is he going to drop in
[2:08:45] the road? If he could, there could be an
[2:08:47] accident cuz there's a little hill and
[2:08:50] all these things are flooding my mind.
[2:08:52] Is he going to just go in the ditch and
[2:08:54] fall there and somebody will steal him?
[2:08:56] We haven't got room. All of these things
[2:08:58] are and and it he just walks over and
[2:09:02] goes through a couple of trees and falls
[2:09:04] between
[2:09:06] on after a big windfall
[2:09:09] and laid there.
[2:09:12] Now I'm finishing and we dressed him
[2:09:14] out.
[2:09:17] Brother, another person was there,
[2:09:19] Brother Blaine Southwick,
[2:09:22] eldest son of Brother Southwick.
[2:09:25] I've never ever heard a word out of his
[2:09:27] mouth.
[2:09:29] He did. He didn't feel anything.
[2:09:31] Friends,
[2:09:33] I wish I could get it across to you. You
[2:09:36] can be sitting right next to one person.
[2:09:38] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[2:09:39] &gt;&gt; And one person gets it and next one
[2:09:41] doesn't get it. He was sitting right
[2:09:42] behind me. It didn't mean it didn't mean
[2:09:44] a thing to him.
[2:09:46] &gt;&gt; Whatever you do, don't go out of this
[2:09:49] meeting without it meaning something to
[2:09:51] you.
[2:09:52] &gt;&gt; Yes. Amen.
[2:09:53] &gt;&gt; I want I want to put you in contact with
[2:09:56] him.
[2:09:56] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[2:09:57] &gt;&gt; I want to tell you, you believe me and I
[2:10:00] I want to tell you how real he is.
[2:10:02] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:10:09] And we just finished and we got back in
[2:10:11] the car
[2:10:13] and there was um
[2:10:16] there was just a presence. I'm sorry to
[2:10:19] take so much time, but there was just a
[2:10:23] I kind of sat back and I thought I'd
[2:10:26] like to live here forever.
[2:10:30] And he just looked at me a little bit
[2:10:32] and he said, "Brother Eddie,
[2:10:43] every time he comes,
[2:10:45] something good happens."
[2:10:48] And that's my testimony to you. every
[2:10:51] time he comes. When you come here
[2:10:55] to this building that human hands have
[2:10:57] built and brothers built, some of them
[2:11:00] aren't here.
[2:11:02] We labored.
[2:11:04] When you come here, just say, "I'm here
[2:11:06] for one purpose.
[2:11:09] I want to talk to you.
[2:11:12] I want to sense that you're nearby.
[2:11:17] I'm going to need that someday.
[2:11:20] might be sooner than you think. Some of
[2:11:22] you young people, you might feel today
[2:11:24] that you don't really need it, but the
[2:11:26] day will come when you do need it.
[2:11:30] &gt;&gt; When you do need it.
[2:11:32] And you that are older, we never know.
[2:11:35] But you know, there'll be a time when
[2:11:38] you need that person. say, "I'm a
[2:11:40] believer, and I'm happy that we can say
[2:11:42] we're are believers of this message,
[2:11:46] but you're going to need the one that
[2:11:48] was being revealed. You're going to need
[2:11:51] the author." Please don't just come
[2:11:54] don't don't don't fail and just make
[2:11:56] this a a church or a central place of
[2:11:59] your fellowship. We should have an
[2:12:02] fellowship amongst the saints, but
[2:12:04] whatever you do, whatever you do, come
[2:12:08] to meet him. come come to know him.
[2:12:12] &gt;&gt; I don't care if you even get
[2:12:15] lost in some other.
[2:12:26] This is how I was.
[2:12:36] My heart was almost broken.
[2:12:39] I was crushed. How long does it take?
[2:12:43] You might be crushed for a year. You
[2:12:45] might be crushed for two years. This had
[2:12:48] been going on for me for it was my load.
[2:12:53] It was a man's load. It was a husband's
[2:12:55] load. It was dad's load.
[2:12:58] This wasn't anyone else's load. But I
[2:13:01] knew one who knew it. I knew that the
[2:13:03] Lord Jesus had said in his word,
[2:13:05] "Certain things are to take place." and
[2:13:08] I'm to bear certain burdens and I was in
[2:13:10] that but I needed I needed a connection.
[2:13:14] I needed a connection elsewhere.
[2:13:19] &gt;&gt; And friends, you might be a woman, you
[2:13:21] might be a teenager,
[2:13:25] but mark my word, I don't care what
[2:13:28] station of life you're in, one day will
[2:13:31] come when you'll need that connection.
[2:13:34] &gt;&gt; And you might be in a dilemma right now.
[2:13:36] You might be in a young person's
[2:13:38] dilemma. You might be in your teens and
[2:13:41] I know that when you're in your teens
[2:13:43] and there's all kinds of things flood
[2:13:45] your mind and but what kind of home your
[2:13:47] life going to have and what kind of wife
[2:13:49] or what kind of a husband? All of these
[2:13:51] things flood your mind. Where am I going
[2:13:54] to go? What what what how should I give
[2:13:57] what should I give myself to? What
[2:13:58] should I study? Where do I go? What kind
[2:14:00] of a profession should I have? I'll tell
[2:14:02] you one thing.
[2:14:05] I'm not ashamed of it. Make your
[2:14:08] profession.
[2:14:10] I want to make heaven my home.
[2:14:13] &gt;&gt; That's my profession.
[2:14:15] That's the only thing. God sent me a
[2:14:18] message and sent me a messenger
[2:14:21] so I wouldn't miss it.
[2:14:23] &gt;&gt; And I don't plan to miss it.
[2:14:27] &gt;&gt; Will you bow your head with me,
[2:14:34] &gt;&gt; Lord Jesus?
[2:14:37] Sometimes it's not easy to
[2:14:40] speak those things that the closest to
[2:14:42] your heart,
[2:14:45] but the people have been so kind.
[2:14:49] They've been so receptive in a way.
[2:14:54] They've been so attentive and so
[2:14:56] listening. And Lord Jesus,
[2:15:00] I can't even equate myself with how you
[2:15:04] love the people.
[2:15:06] But we do love them.
[2:15:09] We don't want to see harm come to any.
[2:15:12] We want to see each one, Lord. We look
[2:15:15] we look beyond the veil,
[2:15:18] beyond the curtain of time.
[2:15:21] And there we want to embrace
[2:15:24] and greet one another and know it's
[2:15:27] over. It's over. It's over. As your
[2:15:30] messenger said, it's over. The battle's
[2:15:34] over. The last sermon's been preached.
[2:15:38] And here we are now. We're entering it
[2:15:41] to 2017.
[2:15:43] We don't know what the future holds.
[2:15:46] By the end of this year,
[2:15:49] things dramatic things could happen and
[2:15:53] we do not know when they likely will
[2:15:55] happen. But then, oh God, we want to
[2:15:59] have that uh divine
[2:16:03] connection. Oh God, I pray in the name
[2:16:07] of Jesus Christ. I want to pray for each
[2:16:10] one, Lord. each one that have been so
[2:16:14] loyal and dear friends. And we've
[2:16:17] journeyied with some a short time and
[2:16:21] with others a longer period of time. But
[2:16:25] oh God, Father, hear my prayer now. I
[2:16:30] pray Lord that we may be able to not
[2:16:35] only greet one another but with such
[2:16:38] joy, with such a uh such a release, such
[2:16:43] an unspeakable
[2:16:46] joy and thanksgiving when the world is
[2:16:49] done, turmoil is done, temptation is
[2:16:53] done, all the evil is done, oh God, in
[2:16:58] the generation you've called us to live,
[2:17:00] live. I know that you've given us the
[2:17:02] answer. Let us derive the answer from
[2:17:06] your message, oh God. From your
[2:17:08] prophet's message, Father, may we hear
[2:17:11] him, may we hear you. When we read a
[2:17:15] passage, oh God, may we not only see

[2:18:29] many aspects within the within the

[2:35:29] calling you and you haven't surrendered
[2:35:32] this morning and you'd like to do that.
[2:35:36] We want to make that time for you this
[2:35:38] January 1st, 2017.
[2:35:42] Softly and tenderly
[2:35:51] tenderly

[2:36:13] He's waiting.
[2:36:15] &gt;&gt; What would hinder
[2:36:18] you from hearing the very
[2:36:22] presence of God this morning?
[2:36:26] Why don't you come home?
[2:36:29] Come home.

[2:36:51] [Music]
[2:36:54] Jesus
[2:36:56] is calling
[2:37:00] calling
[2:37:05] Come home.
[2:37:09] &gt;&gt; Maybe just one more time,
[2:37:12] someone would like to just make their
[2:37:13] way up, rededicate,
[2:37:16] reconsecrate,
[2:37:18] and give Jesus your life for this year.
[2:37:22] You've held back, but the Holy Spirit
[2:37:24] has just been knocking at your door this
[2:37:27] morning.
[2:37:29] You just want to make that one more
[2:37:30] move.
[2:37:33] What a year. How what a way what a way
[2:37:35] to start a year
[2:37:38] to consecrate
[2:37:40] and give
[2:37:42] all of your heart, not just a prayer.
[2:37:47] And we're going to pray. Amen.
[2:37:52] Heavenly Father, we have heard from that
[2:37:55] other dimension this morning.
[2:38:01] Brother Ed spoke of the woman at the
[2:38:03] well began with those that were on the
[2:38:06] way to Emmas.
[2:38:08] Then Jesus drew near.
[2:38:11] And then he spoke of his own experience
[2:38:13] in a a vehicle where Jesus drew near.
[2:38:18] And then we could say, Lord, through
[2:38:20] this service, Jesus has drawn near.
[2:38:26] You've touched hearts this morning.
[2:38:27] You've touched mine. You've challenged
[2:38:29] me. Lord, this is the realm I long to
[2:38:33] dwell in.
[2:38:38] I thirst for, I long for, I live for.
[2:38:45] [Music]
[2:38:49] And Lord, this is that realm we desire
[2:38:51] for all
[2:38:53] to dwell in and live in.
[2:38:58] You have vindicated your message this
[2:39:01] morning.
[2:39:03] [Music]
[2:39:04] May our lives bear fruit of that
[2:39:06] vindication.
[2:39:08] [Music]
[2:39:10] May Lord Jesus, you
[2:39:14] speak to us tenderly and softly
[2:39:16] throughout the days and the weeks that
[2:39:20] you should give.
[2:39:22] May you draw near to us and may we draw
[2:39:24] near to you.
[2:39:27] May you bless this people,
[2:39:29] these the ones that have just come up,
[2:39:31] Lord, that want to dedicate and
[2:39:34] consecrate their lives this year.
[2:39:38] others who've knelt and we've prayed
[2:39:40] with. I pray Lord that your blessing be
[2:39:42] upon each and everyone.
[2:39:44] But not only at the front of the altar,
[2:39:46] but to the back of the church. May the
[2:39:49] glory of God rest upon your people.
[2:39:53] May we be living testimonies,
[2:39:56] tabernacles of God, molded into the very
[2:39:59] image.
[2:40:01] or not given to maybe the books and
[2:40:04] learnings of this life, but given
[2:40:06] ourselves to the word of God himself
[2:40:10] that we might come into the very image
[2:40:11] of God.
[2:40:13] [Music]
[2:40:15] Father, we're thankful for times like
[2:40:18] this. And we pray, Lord, that your
[2:40:20] blessing be upon your people now. May
[2:40:23] the glory of God go with each and every
[2:40:25] one of us.
[2:40:28] And may the presence of God never
[2:40:30] depart.
[2:40:33] Lord, how marvelous it was. Your prophet
[2:40:34] said, "He's as real as he was on that
[2:40:38] day on that road to Emmas." And I can
[2:40:41] testify it's true.
[2:40:45] You are that real Lord.
[2:40:48] So go with us and may the blessing of
[2:40:51] God rest upon us. Strengthen your
[2:40:54] servant.
[2:40:56] Bless brother Ed and sister Ruth.
[2:40:59] Their lives have been fruitful.
[2:41:02] May you give them much more. Lord,
[2:41:06] may this year be a banner year. May the
[2:41:09] glory of God rest upon them in this
[2:41:12] assembly
[2:41:15] as we seek to only live in the perfect
[2:41:18] will of God.
[2:41:20] bless your children now
[2:41:24] in Jesus name we pray.
[2:41:27] Amen. Amen.
[2:41:30] Amen. God bless you soldiers of the
[2:41:33] cross. God bless you. May God give you
[2:41:39] a walk with God you've never quite
[2:41:41] experienced so far. May it grow deeper
[2:41:45] and richer.
[2:41:47] May your lives be fruitful.
[2:41:50] So God bless you. You're dismissed. Any
[2:41:54] manner you wish to stay linger?
[2:42:00] God bless you.
[2:42:02] Amen.
