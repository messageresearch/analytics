TRANSCRIPT
========================================
you know there's a we all know the elite armies of the day and we have these different play battalions or whatever groups that are the mightiest the SAS and all these things they're the elite of the world the elite Warriors of the world you know so these the Navy Seals they're one of these top Elites and they go through what's called hell week four of their training hell week I wonder if we're in what would we consider this age When Death Rides that fourth seal and here we are they train super incredibly to try and get through 200 miles and they they run 200 miles in just one week they sleep for four hours 20 hours of physical training but you know whatever they all go through to get there one thing defines everybody that goes through the training and they have what they they have that hangs in the main Square of the main training area or the Gathering area it's a big Bell and it hangs there it's a big Bell and it sits in front of everybody and if you want to quit you have to go to the Bell I have to ring it three times Bang Bang and you place your hat training army hat on the ground and you walk off and you've quit and as the training goes hat upon hat gets added the Bell continues to get rung and up to 80 plus percent ring the bell but one fella said the one thing that defines everybody that goes through sealed training is that they didn't ring the bell they didn't quit it was it wasn't it so while it was important to be physically fit and all the training that you have to go through you find out though quickly says your background your social status your race none of this matters the only thing that matters is that you go in with purpose in mind and this that you are just not going to quit no matter what happens you know and there they are these are natural Elites that have something inside of them to willing to go all the way they just have they've something is there it's it their makeup is a little bit different willing to go no matter what now how difficult and it's difficult to where they're dragging their carcasses somehow or their buddy is dragging them somehow just so they can get across the line for the day it's grueling it's difficult but something inside of them it just won't allow them to drag themselves up as much as somehow the battle in the mind just go ring the bell no I can't remember just go ring the bell if you just put your hat down there it's all over the pain is gone the agony it disappears you can be free of this wretched hell week and just go home ever had that mind battle just throw in the towel you can't do this no longer you think you've got another day left you can't do it but something inside you something inside of you because you're God's Elite in this day and age and there's some God Particle inside that just drives you on I just can't ring that Bell it's impossible for me to throw in the towel why because you're Gods he has dropped inside of you a seed that is going to grow and manifest in this day exactly what God wants say oh God I don't know how I'm gonna get through it well Humanity goes through some crazy things people have dragged themselves through Wicked situations broken bone situations for miles and miles the human the natural being has something inside some people one fella fell 75 feet shattered his hip his femur and dragged himself for for eight miles through Creeks through streams just to get to a little home to get shattered body I don't even know how he did it something inside this guy he had a determination he had whatever you want to call it Inner Strength inner grit inner determination I don't care he had it that's natural there is something inside a Believer I don't know what you want to call it but I call it God I call it a seed of God that is planted inside of you that your face is set Like Flint and you say I don't care whatever it takes I'm gonna go and see my king amen amen they say well these different ones they say they shouldn't be alive well spiritually maybe some of you think well I just shouldn't be alive spiritually but you are you are you're here you're still fighting because God placed it in you it's not I that runeth but him may I say you know they have a Seal Team Six you know that they're the special ones we have Seal Team indeed may I say Seal Team seven that will overthrow this wicked generation amen I pray today we got fathers I pray we get mommies we get children I don't care teenagers I don't care who it is we need a resolve inside that we would set our face as a flint on the word of God no matter what goes on in this day and age do not lose your vision of Jesus amen and you say Lord this morning I'm willing I'm willing you did it for me I'm willing to do whatever it takes I don't know what that looks like you know what that looks like I don't know the battle you go through I don't know where you're at in your life he'd come he sit in church some have been here many many many years some just recently I don't know but whatever you do I say don't leave the service this morning until you have resolved in your heart you have gone through those those moments of fasting and prayer that yester did and he says I'm willing and I'm going whether it's death or whether it's life I'm doing it all
