[0:32] preacher oh you never heard such in your
[0:34] life but telling her so said it and they
[0:37] had the street cars blocked off in the
[0:39] streets from the ambulances and I've
[0:41] been praying for about 2 or 3 hours and
[0:44] Reverend Brown come to me which is one
[0:46] of the sponsors on the meeting he said
[0:47] brother brandom when you get finished
[0:49] down at the bottom of the auditorium he
[0:51] said there's a case like you never seen
[0:53] before I've been praying for the sick
[0:54] then about 3 or 4 months seen many
[0:56] things in that much time and he said
[0:58] when you get a chance to take a little
[1:00] breath I go to pray for him all night
[1:01] anyhow said come down I want to show you
[1:03] something like you've never seen before
[1:05] I said all right so after a while I went
[1:08] down to the steps and now friends when I
[1:11] got down I'm just telling these things
[1:13] for God's glory you see for the glory of
[1:15] Jesus Christ that you might know some of
[1:17] the things that's happened or millions
[1:19] of things oh I wouldn't say Millions but
[1:21] many thousands of things anyhow it's
[1:22] happened and I went out the bottom of
[1:24] the steps and there laid a lady laying
[1:26] on the floor she was dressed with like
[1:29] shars
[1:30] and she had both hands sticking up like
[1:32] this and her feet sticking right up
[1:33] laying on her back just laying there
[1:35] like that I said there's a typical old
[1:38] Arkansas brother standing there and I
[1:41] said is that your wife he said it is
[1:43] brother Brandon I said why is her her
[1:45] her legs bleeding like they are said
[1:47] well said she's from the insane
[1:49] institution said um she was going to the
[1:52] time of menopause and she had a baby
[1:54] born and it threw her into a premature
[1:57] menopause and the doctor gave her some
[1:59] shots and it went to her head and so she
[2:01] went wild and he'd been in the insane
[2:04] institution 2 years and he had heard
[2:06] about from over Mississippi a solders
[2:09] mother that had been healed and taken
[2:10] out of the institution so he said I
[2:12] brought her said brother Brandon I've
[2:14] got four little children in home and he
[2:17] said and I've I've we've sold her farm
[2:20] and everything he said to to try to get
[2:22] her well and she's taken treatment and
[2:25] said then today he said I I sold my m
[2:30] he said I had to bring her down here and
[2:33] said they let me bring her out just over
[2:35] the night and said they couldn't get her
[2:38] in a handling and I taken some brothers
[2:39] up there and five of us got her out of
[2:42] the place and put her in a car and so
[2:43] that's where she kicked all the glasses
[2:45] out of the car coming down for five men
[2:46] couldn't hold her and when they got her
[2:48] in the building there brother Brown said
[2:50] she' just taken the place said she' just
[2:51] throw a man every way so when they let
[2:54] her down or she lay on her back the
[2:55] store her hands and feet up like that
[2:56] her eyes set real glassy and that's the
[2:58] way she stayed well I said that's too
[3:01] bad I said I'll walk out and take a hold
[3:03] of her hand he said oh brother R don't
[3:05] you do that said she kid you well I said
[3:08] I don't think so and I and it just boy
[3:12] like on the way so not having too much
[3:15] deleting with demonology so he said
[3:17] brother vam I warn you don't do that and
[3:20] I said oh I don't think you'd hurt me
[3:21] brother and I walk down a little step
[3:23] like that walked out on the floor she
[3:24] was laying there her hands up I said how
[3:26] do you do sister tuck a hole of her hand
[3:28] and just as I tuck a hole of her hand I
[3:30] she just gripped down like that and if
[3:33] she gave a pull like that and she pulled
[3:35] me practically off of my feet and she
[3:38] would have threw me across the room and
[3:41] I watch she would have weighed about 10
[3:43] I guess 70 or 80 lbs and that demon
[3:46] power do you ever see a person possessed
[3:47] with demon power they got four times
[3:50] their strength well the devil can give
[3:52] you four times strength when possessed
[3:53] with him what about possessed with the
[3:54] Holy Ghost how much power could God give
[3:56] you see and then that's the reason
[3:59] you're afraid you it's Don't Be
[4:00] Afraid F away them crutches and get up
[4:02] and start off God's with you if he's
[4:04] anointed you he'll give it to you that's
[4:06] right be Anointed with the Holy Spirit
[4:08] then when this woman she jerked me like
[4:11] that and I almost come off of my feet
[4:13] and I threw my foot like that and caught
[4:16] her right across the breast like this I
[4:17] caught and it pulled my hand out of hers
[4:20] well I I ran back towards the the steps
[4:24] again he said I told you brother Brandon
[4:26] and she started making a real funny
[4:27] noise going m mhm M and she started
[4:31] crawling like a snake on her back just a
[4:33] real you can hear dragging you know just
[4:35] drag drag like that across the floor
[4:38] concrete like that and she got against
[4:40] the wall put her great big Strong Limbs
[4:42] against the wall and kicked like that
[4:44] when she did she hit a a seat and her
[4:46] head hit like that and it there's a seat
[4:48] sitting there where the people have been
[4:49] sitting in before they brought her there
[4:51] and it broke the seat the bench it was
[4:55] and the hair and blood come out of her
[4:58] head she just started making funny noise
[5:00] picked up that thing in her hand like
[5:02] that and threw it at her husband and
[5:03] just knocked the claster Off the Wall
[5:05] where right to the side of where he was
[5:06] at said you see brother Brandon but now
[5:10] all hopes is gone said what can I do and
[5:13] he a poor old fellow started crying put
[5:14] his arms up around me like that old
[5:16] patched overalls on I felt so sorry for
[5:18] the boy and I said well brother look the
[5:22] only thing I know to tell you that this
[5:25] angel that met me told me that if I be
[5:28] sincere and get the people to believe
[5:30] when I prayed that he'd heal the sick I
[5:33] said do you believe that the simple
[5:35] Faith to believe that Jesus Christ the
[5:37] son of God cast out devils and he he has
[5:40] gone up into the father now and he's
[5:42] sharing the form of the Holy Spirit I
[5:44] said I believe he's the same Jesus the
[5:46] day that he was then I said I don't have
[5:48] to tell you what's wrong you know what's
[5:50] wrong he said that's right I said Do you
[5:52] believe if I'll ask God God will do it
[5:54] he said I do and about that time she
[5:56] turned around on her back she said
[5:58] William brandom you have got nothing to
[6:00] do with me I brought her here come
[6:02] crawling up towards me while her husband
[6:05] turned said what's this so that woman
[6:07] don't even know her own
[6:09] name said she hasn't spoke a word in two
[6:12] years I said that wasn't her that was
[6:15] that
[6:16] devil that's that devil he knows that
[6:19] he's going to have to leave the woman if
[6:21] you'll only believe on the Lord Jesus
[6:23] Christ right now and he kept calling
[6:26] like that you have nothing to do with me
[6:28] I brought her here so I said now you
[6:30] agree with me he said all right I said
[6:32] heavenly father in the name of your son
[6:35] Jesus Christ make that devil leave the
[6:37] woman so she didn't never talk no more
[6:40] she just he said what shall I do I said
[6:42] take her own back as the service is over
[6:44] do you believe it's got to happen he
[6:46] said all right so about 3 months after
[6:49] that I was up here at Jonesboro and I
[6:52] had to see somebody back there waving I
[6:54] didn't know who it was sitting right out
[6:55] like that just waving at me and it was a
[6:57] it was the woman sitting there she said
[6:59] don't you recognize me brother random I
[7:01] said no I don't she had her four little
[7:03] children all sitting around she said
[7:05] well the last time you see me they told
[7:06] me that I was bleeding all over and I
[7:08] was out of my head and the he had tucked
[7:11] the woman back had no trouble taking her
[7:13] back she set up and the second day when
[7:15] she's in the institution I said let them
[7:16] dismiss her so the second day they come
[7:20] to her and she was setting up the third
[7:22] day they give her a discharge from the
[7:24] place and her home in her right mind see
[7:27] that's right Jesus Christ was saying yes
