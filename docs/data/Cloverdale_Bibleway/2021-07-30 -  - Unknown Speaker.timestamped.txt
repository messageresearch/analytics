[0:00] social engineering aims to change the
[0:03] thinking
[0:04] and the behavior of the masses
[0:07] now government policies aimed at
[0:09] discouraging
[0:10] perceived undesirable behaviors
[0:14] are the engine of social manipulation
[0:19] just give you enough information and
[0:22] maybe that information is the truth
[0:24] but not to give you the big picture just
[0:27] to give you enough
[0:28] truth for you to calculate a decision
[0:31] that they know is going to be the wrong
[0:32] decision though you've made a
[0:34] you've calculated only because uh with
[0:37] the facts that you've got
[0:38] at hand so you make a decision the very
[0:41] best that you can but because you
[0:42] haven't got all the information
[0:44] you'll be forced to make the wrong
[0:46] decision and be left
[0:47] thinking you've made a good decision and
[0:49] it's your idea you thought of it
[0:51] and if you thought of it it's got to be
[0:53] good
[0:55] right if the brothers can put the next
[0:58] video on
[0:59] as soon as it comes up brother can you
[1:00] push pause
[1:14] i know the big picture in somebody
[1:15] else's life
[1:17] and you're going to make the wrong
[1:18] conclusion
[1:20] [Music]
[1:21] social engineering religious realm
[1:26] satan working on human bias
[1:30] didn't we read out here lest satan
[1:34] should get an advantage of us for we
[1:37] are not ignorant of his devices
[1:41] praise the lord techniques of demons
[1:45] so before you can engage in manipulating
[1:49] society
[1:50] you must have reliable information
[1:54] regarding that society you need to know
[1:56] their strengths and their weaknesses
[1:58] and the devil's watching you because
[2:01] you're the last stand i've got good news
[2:02] for you
[2:03] good news church the devil hates you
[2:08] that's okay right if he's unhappy i'm
[2:12] happy
[2:13] he hates you and the prophet said he
[2:15] will his only avenue because we
[2:17] are dealing with a defeated enemy his
[2:20] only avenue that he can take is the
[2:22] power of deception so he's watching your
[2:25] biases
[2:27] and he's saying ah i can use that i can
[2:30] get in there with a wedge
[2:32] and the devil heard solomon say vanity
[2:34] vanity all his vanity so the devil said
[2:36] that's good i can use that
[2:39] human bias techniques of demons
[2:44] so you have to have reliable information
[2:47] about the society that you're about to
[2:49] engineer and you have to have effective
[2:52] tools to do the job
[2:55] amen and both of these information and
[2:57] tools have become very
[2:58] uh available very early
[3:02] available recently so you
[3:05] have to gather and you have to analyze
[3:07] the information about the social and the
[3:08] political trends of the people
[3:10] their biases their strengths their
[3:12] weakness and that's why the devil
[3:15] studies you he's very interested in you
[3:19] um you know why the devil's so
[3:20] interested in you because he hear the
[3:22] lord say not
[3:22] one will be left behind so he knows if
[3:25] he can just get one
[3:27] just one he knows he's wrecked the whole
[3:30] program of god
[3:32] so he's so bent on studying you because
[3:34] he knows
[3:35] all he needs out of thousands thousands
[3:37] times ten thousands
[3:39] is just one and there's a whole lot
[3:42] sitting in a room with
[3:43] this many people there's a whole lot of
[3:45] human biases
[3:46] right in here whether you like to admit
[3:48] it or not
[3:50] every single one of us is a sucker for
[3:52] something that's why the prophet of god
[3:54] said no your weak spot know it
[3:56] and keep it covered social engineering
[4:00] it's the technique
[4:01] of the devil if he can't get you with
[4:03] the wrong doctrine you'll come in and
[4:04] he'll use the music
[4:06] brother brown said grip you and drag you
[4:08] to armageddon you know what happens if
[4:10] you're standing turning to
[4:10] armageddon how's next
[4:16] so understanding that forever is a very
[4:18] long time
[4:19] let's get it right now
[4:21] [Applause]
[4:23] and if you take the attitude while i'm
[4:24] alex i'll be okay it proves something
[4:27] hasn't happened yet
[4:29] because if you've got the holy ghost you
[4:31] want to please god you want to do what's
[4:32] right
[4:33] you don't take the attitude well if i'm
[4:35] elected i'm elect
[4:38] if i'm elected i can do whatever i want
[4:42] if you're elect you'll do what god wants
