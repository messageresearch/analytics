Blessed be your name Lord Jesus. Blessed be your name, Lord Jesus. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah, Lord Jesus. Amen. Lord Jesus, ask our brother John Andes to come and open the service in a word of prayer. Uh our brother Morris Cochril is requesting us to pray for sister Glattis. mother passed on to be with the Lord and just wanting us to pray that the Lord would give Glattus wisdom to witness and be a comfort to her family. And uh Sister Claire is requesting prayer for a friend who was stricken suddenly with a crippling disease. She and her husband are Christians and ask or asking the congregation to pray for her healing. Sister Claire has witnessed to her husband already. Uh, sister Liz Neighbor is requesting prayer for Sharon uh Stzman, a young mother from Indiana, Indiana who's been given a few days to live. Apparently, her lungs are full of cancer. She has battled through brain tumors, surgeries, bone cancer, pancreas cancer. Her faith is very high and she is asking to live to be able to take care of her family. Amen. So, let's just unite our hearts this morning with these. If you're here and you have a request in your heart, if you're listening in, you just lift before the Lord as we go to prayer. Amen. I wonder again this morning if we could all just pray out in your own way right there where you're at, even our musicians up to the sound people into the nursery, wherever you're at in the building. Don't have the person leading in prayer say your prayer for you. Just cry out to the Lord. Speak to him right there where you're at. And I believe God will do &gt;&gt; greater things for us when we just let go and let him have his way right at this time. Let's lift up our hearts together. Father, our hearts are lifted up. Our hands are lifted up. Father, we've come this morning expecting the supernatural. Lord, our hearts are ready and prepared for your presence. Lord, right now at the start of this service, we've sang. We've praised you. We want to lift up our hearts in total surrender, Lord. Father, this whole congregation, myself, we want to lift up our voices in adoration and praise. Father, you've done a miracle in our lives. You've done a new creation right among us, Lord. You've healed our bodies. You've healed our souls. You've healed our wounded spirits. Lord, we want to thank you for that, Lord. You are the same yesterday, today, and forever. You're alive and you're the same, Father. We want to confess it, Lord, that you are our Lord. You're our savior. You're our husband, Father. We want to adore your name and put you in your rightful place. We want you to have preeminence, Jesus. Lord, we don't want to have this service without you. We want you to come down among us in a special way, Father. God, there's lives here. My hands are lifted up, Father. We need your appearing, God. We love your appearing. We love your word. We love your presence. Father, if somebody could just speak the right word, somebody could pray in the right way. These demons of cancer, these demons of of torment, demons of lethargy, demons of of fear, and whatever would stand in the way, Lord. Father, may they be broken this morning in the name of Jesus Christ. Loose every brother, every sister, every young person, every older one. Father, Father, we're headed to award communion service, Lord. We want to prepare ourselves. We want our hearts to be right. Lord, even this morning, Lord, we want your word to be direct to our lives as disciples. Lord, we want to watch and wait and pray with you, not be falling asleep, but we want to be right there, Father, hearing your voice, praying with you, having the mind of Christ. We want your will to be done in earth as it is in heaven. All across the building, our hands are lifted up. Unspoken requests, these that were read out, Father, nothing is impossible for you. Let your will be done in these lives. Father, glorify yourself for the glory of God. Let your will be manifested in healings, in character. Lord, we want to wait on you. Let the mind of Christ drop down inside of each one of us. Jesus, we say yes, Lord. Have your way today, God. We've waited for this day and we believe that today is a wonderful day because we're near our homecoming time and there must be precious words that will proceed to our hearts from your throne. I believe somebody's going to be healed today. Somebody could be saved, Lord, right even now. someone could be filled with the Holy Spirit as we stand waiting in your presence. Our lives being cleansed, sanctified, filled up. Oh God, I just pray that your presence would be so pleased today by the gathering of your people even out over the internet and the phone hookups that lives would stand and be delivered. Oh God, may it happen, Father. Take control of every life, every need. We surrender it to you now, believing already the answer is on the way. You're giving us what we have need of. We thank you for it. Bless Brother Rod. Bless the service. Bless the remainder of the service. Bless every worshipper in spirit and in truth. Come down among us, Jesus. Do the impossible. We pray in Jesus name. We thank you, Lord. Amen. Amen. You may be seated. Want to welcome all those who are here visiting with us. And I know we got a lot of the saints from Seattle that are here today uh to be with us. and we're happy to have each and every one of you and want to make sure that everyone here at the church makes a real welcome. Um, uh, note from brother Jason, there's going to be no senior choir practice after the service this morning. And, uh, we have a special this morning for brother Mark Hegman and brother Matthew Wilson. Why don't you guys come and get ready at this time, brothers? And, uh, while they're uh, while they're doing that, let's sing together. Consume me Lord with the fire of your spirit. Is that your desire this morning? &gt;&gt; Amen. We want to be burnt up. The zeal of the Lord. Consume me Lord with the fire of your spirit. Come to me Lord and make me all like you. Break me, Lord, and bless the broken pieces of my life. [Music] Let me be used by you. Consume me, Lord. Lord, with the fire of your spirit, come to me, Lord, and make me more like you. Oh, praise me, Lord, and bless the broken pieces of my life. Let me be you by you. The gates and doors were barred and all the windows fastened down. I spent the night in sleeplessness and rose at every sound. Half in hopeless sorrow and half in fear. The day would find the soldiers breaking through to drag us all away. Just before the sunrise, I heard something at the wall. The gate began to rattle and a voice began to call. I hurried to the window and looked down into the street, expecting swords and torches and the sounds of soldiers feet. [Music] There was no one there but Mary, so I went down to let her in. John stood there beside me as she told us where she'd been. She said they moved him in the night and none of us knows where. The stones been rolled away and now his body isn't there. We both ran toward the garden. Then John ran on ahead. We found the stone and the empty tomb just the way that Mary said. And the winding sheet they wrapped him in was just an empty shell. But who or where they'd taken him was more than I could tell. Something strange had happened there. Just what I did not know. John believed a miracle, but I just turned to go. Circumstance and speculation couldn't lift me very high. because I'd seen them crucify him. And then I saw him die. [Music] Back inside the house again, the guilt and anguish came, and everything I'd promised him just added to my shame. When at last it came to choices, I denied I knew his name. And even if he was alive, it wouldn't be the same. Then suddenly the air was filled with a strange and sweet perfume. A light that came from everywhere drove shadows from the room. Jesus stood before me with his arms held open wide. I fell down on my knees and clung to him and cried. [Music] He raised me to my feet. And as I looked into his eyes, love came shining out from him like sunlight in the skies. The guilt and my confusion disappeared in sweet release. And every fear I'd ever had just melted into peace. [Music] He's alive. He's alive. He's alive and I'm forgiven. Heaven's gates are open wide. He's alive. Alive. He's alive. He's alive and I'm forgiven. Heaven's gates are open wide. He's alive. Hallelujah. He's our life. [Music] Praise God. &gt;&gt; Do you believe he's alive this morning? &gt;&gt; Amen. And he's here. &gt;&gt; Praise God. Praise God. And we can know him this morning. We believe we're going to be here from him. Amen. We're going to be turning to the word at this time. And uh let's sing together. Oh, how He loves you and me. Oh, how he loves you and me. He gave himself. What more could he do? Oh, how he loves you and me. Oh, how he loves you and me. He gave himself. What more could he do? Oh, how he loves you. Oh, how he loves me. Oh, how he loves you and me. Oh, how he loves you and me. Oh, how he loves you and me. He gave himself what could he do. Oh, how he loves you. Oh, how he loves me. Oh, how he loves you and me. Say it once again, saints. Oh, how he loves you and me. Oh, how he loves you and me. He gave himself what I want to hear you. Oh, how he loved you. Oh, how he loves me. Oh, how he loves you and me. Quiet in me. Let peaceful waterers flow [Music] to be still my soul. Oh, let me hear Jesus. Touch me, Lord. Quiet. That's your prayer this morning. Sing it to him. Oh, quiet. [Applause] Oh, and peace. Oh, I s [Music] to be still my soul and let me let me hear my Jesus call me. Touch me Lord. [Music] Just sing it to him now. Why are you to my soul? Let me be my Jesus. Touch me Lord in quiet. Let's just sing it without any instruments now. Just to him. Oh, let peaceful be still my soul. [Music] and let me hear my Jesus walking. &gt;&gt; Oh, Lord. [Music] Thank brother Rod. Wonderful to be in his presence this morning. Amen. It's good to be in the house of God. &gt;&gt; A lot of other places that we could be today, but we're here. We're here to worship him and here to receive and we're also here to contribute. &gt;&gt; Amen. We had a had a phone call from brother brother Ken Ordeal. He's been with brother Vin and they were together in uh Grenada where there's been such destruction which we are well aware of and they went down initially to see uh the homes of homes that don't exist anymore of about 15 believers homes turned out to be about 38. He's coming back uh with pictures. He said took pictures of some of the families just standing on the rubble of their homes. Nothing exists anymore. Some are under just some tarps, some pieces of tin, and when any wind comes, which they have had since the hurricanes and the wind has blown that away. So, but there it's not been an easy time. Also, there's two churches that are now non-existent. And so, uh, men of vision are desiring to, uh, build and put up some structures for them, for these homes, and, uh, for these churches. So, we'll know more about this this coming week. uh we are naturally burdened for them uh people in great need. So let's remember and pray for the brothers. It's not easy. There's a lot of hurdles that we are not a uh we're not privy to. We don't know all the details, but we uh we just pray that God will help the brothers and help us to do what we can. Uh this afternoon, we'd like to start the meeting just a wee bit early. And it's it's a difficult thing because I know some of the congregation here, if we start at 4:00, it's a little too early and they don't seem to have enough time between meetings. But we have so many that have come from far away from Seattle, Tacoma, and so and perhaps even further and they wish to be with us tonight at the communion table, a footwashing service tonight. We have baptism tonight as well. There's several are going to be baptized. I would like to say to those that are going to be baptized, if they will meet me, please at 4:00 in the office at 400 p.m. And we're going to start the service at 4:30. That just gives us a little bit of head start so that those that have driven so far, another half hour earlier, especially with them and their families and all, it will make it uh so much better. So, I think that'll be fine for everyone. And uh well the Lord gave us a gracious time Wednesday and uh as can be expected whenever whenever God you know comes and meets his people in in any special way you can be sure that Satan's going to go on the rampage. And he has certainly been doing that. He has been on the rampage ever since. Uh we don't fear him. We're not going to be disturbed about it. And uh and if you have experienced that, you should just say, "Well, praise God. We did stir his nest. He's not he's not sitting there uh taking things easy. He we stirred his nest. Got him angry." Now, I'll tell you what, we ought to have every service that gets him good and angry. Amen. We want to remember uh those that uh there's been all kinds of things take place that have just unbelievable. And uh we just want uh we want the people to know and those that are are our internet congregation as well that are listening and streaming today wherever they are some in different countries whatever more but we we want to be in the midst of the battle. &gt;&gt; We don't want to be at ease in Zion. Amen. Hallelujah. Praise the Lord. I'm just checking the congregation. Hallelujah. I would like to uh sing just before we turn to the word. We have a wonderful atmosphere just now, but I would like to sing we place you in the highest place. Wonder, brother Rod, if you can just take a microphone and and let's stand. We'll get ready to read the word. On Wednesday, I I spoke on that which was torn is healed. And I would like to continue on from there. I I You'll have to pray for me. I've got some slides. Uh forgot my computer at home. Came without the slides, so I sent someone else back to get it. And I want you to be able to read some of these things. So, I hope that that all gets together. That isn't what I was referring to when I was talking about all hell breaks loose and Satan. We have Sister Sister Marjorie Miles is is lying in my office right now having some kind of an attack. Uh it's just the devil. &gt;&gt; Just the devil. He'd like to disturb the her and the service and others, but we're going to take authority over it in the name of Jesus Christ. So, let's just prepare ourselves for the word now. Brother Rod, we place you in the highest for you on a great high. Oh yes, Lord, we place you high above all. [Applause] [Music] All else have we come to you and worship at your glory. [Music] Everyone once again please we place you in the highest place for you by great high. relationship far above all else. all else and we come to you and worship at your feet. Indeed, our Lord Jesus, we come and worship at your feet. such a sacred, holy, privileged place that we as poor, needy humans could come before the almighty God. And we could not come unless there was a sacrifice there and that sacrifice is hanging there for us. The blood has been shed. The price has been paid and the way has been made for every believer to come. We do not come with doubts and fears. We do not come with insecurity. We come Lord with assurance. For we have read in your word and we believe those words are true. That if we know that we are heard and you hear us, then we have the assurance. We have the we are certain that we will have the answer for those things which we ask. We ask for your presence. We ask for your presence that you will be amongst us mightily. We ask that you will be in attendance and that the angels of God which are encircling the believer's camp this morning that you will be Lord made known to the people through your word and through the preaching and through the mighty manifestation. for we need a God that comes down amongst us and heals the sick and delivers the bound. Touch our sister Marjorie Miles just now. Touch her we pray. Oh God, I pray you'll give wisdom, Father, to brothers and sisters that need divine wisdom at this time. They're facing decisions in the coming days and they need your wisdom. I pray that you will endure them now with a special gift of wisdom. Oh God, others Lord, how the enemy's come to torment them. I pray that you'll bind that tormentor and send him far from their place, Lord cast him far from the people. And may your sheep this morning within the fold. May they sense that not only your presence and nearness of the great shepherd, but then we can rest and be at peace. Lord, I ask that you will grace this day with the divine nearness of of our Lord Jesus Christ by the Holy Spirit. And as we come to the communion table tonight, Lord, and and the baptisms, I pray that you will just mightily, mightily presence yourself, manifest yourself, do all manner of things that will get glory to your name. And now anoint the people to hear. Anoint myself to speak. Anoint and bless all that are connected with us whether by telephone or through the internet. And all that may ever hear this service in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. God bless you. If you'll take your Bible, we're going to read a few verses from Ephesians which we read on Wednesday. Ephesians the 2 chapter and then I'm going to read from Hosea, the prophet Hosea, which is the book immediately following Daniel. But we'll read in Ephesians first starting with verse one. And you hath he quickened, who were dead in trespasses and sins, wherein in time past ye walked according to the course of this world, according to the prince of the power of the air, the spirit that now workketh in the children of disobedience, among whom also we all had our conversation in times past, in the lusts of our flesh, fulfilling the desires of the flesh and of the mind, and where by nature the children of wrath, even as others. Verse 12, that at that time ye were without Christ, being aliens from the commonwealth of Israel, and strangers from the covenants of promise, having no hope, and without God in the world. And then in Hosea I want to read uh from chapter 6 verses 1 2 and 3. Come and let us return unto the Lord for he hath torn and he will heal us. He hath smitten and he will bind us up. After two days will he revive us. In the third day he will raise us up and we shall live in his sight. Then shall we know if we follow on to know the Lord. His going forth is prepared as the morning and he shall come unto us as the rain as the latter and former reign unto the earth. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; May God bless his word to our hearts. You may have your seats. Now, I'd like you to be just as attentive as possible and as still as possible and as little movement as possible because uh we need to pray for one another. You need to pray for me and I and pray for yourself also. I have so much that I I feel I need to say and it's sometimes it's a challenge to get the people just up and moving in the same channel. So I wish to try to uh accomplish that by God's help as quickly as possible. the scripture which we've now just read in Hosea. Uh this is a very prophetic scripture. Brother Brandham used this scripture as his text in recognizing your day and his its message. recognizing your day and its message, that day's message. Uh there is a there is a continuity between Hosea and even in the prophet's ministry there is a continuity of scripture. Uh brother Brandham calls it uh compound. We all have used that terminology and anyone who has studied or read the Bible. Many ministers, they will use that uh phrase that the Bible has a compound meaning. I'm going to give you some examples of that in just a little while. Uh, brother Brandham uses the term it goes in cycles because what happens is the same conditions will come about at a future time and then we'll find that scripture that has been spoken for an event of maybe two or 3,000 years ago. That scripture will come into effect again. Now the scriptur is always effective but the scripture will be spoken and dealt with uh in a in a at a certain specific time to meet a certain conditions which are at that time. And then when they come again one of outstanding one is out of Egypt have I called my son. And the direct reference was God calling his people out of Egypt. But it had a greater reference to calling Christ. Christ coming out of Egypt after Jesus was born and Joseph and Mary had to flee into Egypt. And then after Herod had died, they came back that it might be fulfilled, out of Egypt have I called my son. But that scripture had already been spoken concerning Israel coming out of Egypt. But it had a greater meaning and a more fuller meaning when Jesus was brought out of Egypt. And I can say that you were brought out of Egypt &gt;&gt; that you might manifest the son &gt;&gt; of God revealed in this time. And so he called you out of Egypt. And now it has even a fuller meaning uh when we come to that aspect of it. Now uh Hosea begins here by saying come let us return unto the Lord for he hath torn and he will heal us and he hath smitten &gt;&gt; and he will bind us up. &gt;&gt; This is an aspect of God that very few people understand. uh even we we hear a question well why is there sin and why did God you know allow sin and where did iniquity come from and all these kind of questions. one of the one of the foundation uh ingredients that a believer must have and that is God is sovereign and God can do things and will do things that you and I have no business questioning &gt;&gt; and we say well are we just that gullible in the in in the case of God I will say yes that we just believe that God is sovereign He does what he wishes to do. And he his mind and the scope of eternal God is so far beyond us little puny insignificant creatures creeping here upon the earth that we don't even hardly have a a scarce breath of time within the scope of time and we're gone. And God is God. He's always He's always been. And if he desires to allow something, so be it. &gt;&gt; So be it. Whatever he desires, so be it. And we have to learn that the sovereignty of God, Jacob have I loved, Esau have I hated. &gt;&gt; Now, a lot of people don't even like to quote that scripture. And the scripture also tells us, "For this cause I raised thee up," speaking of Pharaoh. And the Bible says that God hardened his heart. Well, a lot of people don't understand that and they don't even like to read that scripture because they don't understand it. Well, the f the first and most basic thing is that you just say that whatever God did that is perfect. &gt;&gt; Whatever he did is perfect. &gt;&gt; I can tell you how he hardens a person's heart is he presents him with the presents him with his word first. God never sent uh you know some spirit there to harden his heart. God presented him with the word and he hardened his heart. So God hardened his heart. &gt;&gt; Because God presented him with the gospel. &gt;&gt; You see before you can reject, you have to be presented with something. And so God presents the people, God presented this generation with his word through a prophet, a spoken word through a prophet. God God presented Israel with the living word in perfection in Jesus Christ and they rejected it. But they couldn't reject it till it was presented to them. And so God allowed their heart to be hardened. &gt;&gt; God allowed sin in the world, believe it or not, so he could become more great. Greater. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Absolutely. Amen. &gt;&gt; And so he hath torn to rend or to tear in pieces. And we went into that a wee bit on Wednesday night. We've become a callous generation. We've heard so much and we've been so connected to uh a world by the media uh of tragedy and we hear it every day from childhood. We hear it. Uh we hear of all the catastrophic things and people being slain and people being beheaded and uh uh all the terrorism that's taking place and the tragedy that's taking place and pretty soon it runs off our back. It's just some more news in the day. It's the same kind of thing happening. Same tragedies just different people's names &gt;&gt; and we become callous to it. It's unfortunate we become callous to it and then uh there's all kinds of uh all kinds of support things that are given so that even when uh uh a a tearing experiences which taken which take place and I spoke on Wednesday I don't want to take any time this morning but on uh the wars how wars have tore away some of our finest young men and young women out from the arms of their loved ones and and fathers from their young children and babies and and from their young wives and have taken them and they're laying in some foreign soil and some of them have never been found. Those are those are horrific friends. That that is something that God never designed that that has been allowed but God has never designed it. It's absolutely horrific. homes are absolutely shattered and torn and fathers and mothers from children uh all kinds of habits of life be it drug or be it uh uh a life of crime or be it alcohol or be it whatever it is it's it's a Satan's world &gt;&gt; it's a Satan's Eden and it's just rending and tearing lives and homes until people uh don't only become callous to it but they find that they have to kind of protect themselves and they're afraid to give themselves out, afraid to uh, you know, to expose themselves or make themselves vulnerable because they feel that they have to almost protect themselves. All kinds of complexes come in, opens the door for the enemy, for Satan to put all kinds of complexes and fear upon the people. Uh, and and that is true, is it not? &gt;&gt; That's the world that we're living in. But it's the devil's world. And I'm telling you, we're here today on our way to another world that will know none of those things. &gt;&gt; We talk about all these things that are severed. I'm going to going to speak very personally just for a moment. I can my my mind barely can cope with the thought of certain separations in life. I don't like to think I like to think about the rapture. I like to think about going home. I don't like to think about going by the way of the grave, but it is a reality. &gt;&gt; It's a reality that a lot of people don't want to face. Neither do I want to face it. I have difficulty talking about to my wife in the event that I go, "This needs to happen. That needs to happen." I don't like to think about that. And I I I hate to think about her being left without me. Uh I don't want to be selfish, but I I think that I would have a more difficult time perhaps being without her. These are kind of separations that we we can't hardly cope with. But one my mind one that my mind short circuits on. I want you to listen close is to pass from this life and be separated from God. &gt;&gt; My mind short circuits. I can't grasp. I could grasp falling into a 6-ft hole and if that was the end of it, that would be fine. But to know that's not the end of it. &gt;&gt; That is not the end of it for you. And it's not the end of it for me. It's just the beginning of a whole another phase. &gt;&gt; And that jars me into reality every day. I want to live as he wants me to live. I want to live pleasing. I want to be able to come before him, not in a series of good works, but I want to be able to come before him and say, "Father, in life, I sought to have the smile of your approval. And I trust I can come into your presence now through the shed blood of your son, and I want to know that I have done what I should do in this life." Amen. &gt;&gt; I cannot think and every person here needs to think seriously and live with that before them that we cannot afford to be separated from him. &gt;&gt; I believe that's in the heart of every believer. That is one separation you cannot afford. &gt;&gt; Amen. I would recommend every man woman live as fervently live for God and forget this world and forget all of its attractions, its enchantments, its snares to snare a person whether it be uh the cares of life or whether it be the advancement in this world or we want to live here for eternity and whatever doors God opens s for you. Whatever positions you are called on to take, let it be a life that you will live in this life for eternity to have an effect on someone to influence someone or whatever it might be. If God blesses you, that you might use it for the kingdom of God in every which way. Hallelujah. If God gives you a car, use it for God. Gives you a home, use it for the kingdom of God. gives you a better job or whatever it gives you gives you a a super intelligence, use it for the kingdom of God, whatever it might be. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; There was a horrific moment of separation in the garden. Yes. &gt;&gt; And the Bible tells us Paul speaking to Timothy, for Adam was first formed, then Eve, and Adam was not deceived, but the woman being deceived was in the transgression. Adam typing Christ. And as I just refer back to Wednesday, for those of you that were here, I'm saying it for those that were not here. Satan through the serpent succeeded by perverting just one word and thus tore Eve away from the headship of Adam. And Adam typing Christ was tore from his fellowship, from his dominion, from his position that God had given him was tore from that fellowship and that position because he he he loved her. He loves his wife and he went in and took her quickly, the prophet said to himself. I want to read this most marvelous. It really is marvelous descriptive language. It is almost as though it's almost as though brother Brandham is actually looking into Eden and seeing and I wouldn't be surprised he was &gt;&gt; prophet looks into the past looks into the future but you won't find this kind of description said I see speaking of Adam I see his so shoulders stooping around his big body here Comes an old bloody sheep skin running down those big banny legs with blood. Tears is dripping off his cheeks, patting on the top of Eve's head as she leans over on his bosom. And little Eve crying. Another place he says they can cry now. They're mortals now. And she leans over on his bosom and little Eve crying and tears patting down as it mixes with blood running down her bosom. What's the matter? Something's happened. They can cry now. They're mortal now. They're dying now. There you are. I can see God say, "Depart out of my presence. couldn't stand it. I can see Adam start walking away. And as he did, I can hear something going, slapping skins against his legs, old bloody sheep skin flopping against his leg as he's going out. And oh, I can see God who covers space and time, who has no beginning and no ending. I can see it all bottled up, funneled down, coming down like this. for one fourlettered word l o v e. &gt;&gt; He couldn't see his children depart from him. Now why he had made the covenant conditional with Adam, but now he makes an unconditional and said, I will put enmity between the woman's seed and he would bruise the serpent's head and so forth, promising a savior. God did not say, "Is that all right with you, Adam?" God said, "I am doing that. &gt;&gt; I am going to put enmity between the woman and the serpent." And between the serpent's seed and her seed, and her seed, the only seed a woman received outside of a man was Jesus Christ was the seed of God. And the Holy Ghost shall overshadow thee, Mary. and thou shalt conceive and bring forth a son, and shall call his name Jesus, for he shall save his people from their sins. Unconditional covenant. How I thank God for that covenant. And since this catastrophic moment in history when man lost his inheritance and he lost his lost his life and he lost his inheritance in that life, there's always been a need in man to return or to be united because he was separated. He was severed. And I believe that across the entire spectrum of the human uh human existence there's a desire there's a desire there's a need within the human psyche to be connected to be wanted to be a part that's why uh we want to be part of a family we want to be part of some kind of a community or association of people we want to be part of of another person's life. We we want and and marriage is the most sacred and wonderful thing because you have a partner. You have someone that you love, someone that you can uh relate to and associate with uh and and and have your most intimate uh conversations with or a friend. And that is why there's all kinds of groups that and even within a nation they seek to have somebody they can unify behind and nations struggle with that. Ukraine goes to the polls I think tomorrow. United States will have a vote in another few days this week. And it's troubling when they say it's a nation divided. They wonder if they will have uh even a president that is can be one for the majority of the people. They they they need men that they can rally around. Nations look for that. &gt;&gt; And they unite the United Nations. They unite so they can achieve something that they can't do individually, but they trust they can do it together. we will have more strength together. Nations unite that they might have economic power, economic benefits and so they have NAFTA and they have the European Union or whatever more and other nations which are ostracized or left out such as Turkey is right now. They want to get in. Please let us in. Open the door. &gt;&gt; So, well, you have to do all of these things and after you do all these things, we'll check it out and see if we'll let you in. And and nations don't want to be left out. People don't want to be left out. We don't want to be excluded. We don't want to be ostracized. We don't want to be rejected and put out. That's bad enough in life. But as I said, one place we cannot afford to be separated from is from the presence of God and from a holy God and from eternal life. The key to understanding oneness, the key to understanding true oneness and unity is to understand what it was first in the mind of God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Let's pray that we understand this now. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We need to go back to the beginning. And in the beginning, God said, "Let us make man in our image and in our likeness." And for trinitarians who may be listening or who are struggling with this says, "Let us so they have a plurality of God." But I always agree say that's exactly right. And did God did he did he do what he said he was going to do? Let us make man in our image and after our plural likeness. And so he made man in his image. And I always ask trinitarians when God was done his work, how many people did he have? &gt;&gt; Was it his image? Absolutely. Did he only make something part of his image? No. He made one in his image. And when he was done, he had a man. But in the man was qualities. In the man was characteristics. In the man he had masculine and feminist because God separated out from him the feminist part &gt;&gt; and put it in a woman called Eve. &gt;&gt; But after the creation was done and that's why brother Brandon calls it a byproduct. Don't think that he made less of you ladies. Not at all. But after the creation was finished, then he took from Adam a rib, a part of his body, which would be a type because Adam was also a type of Christ. He was the first Adam. Jesus was the second Adam. And he takes a part of his body. And now it's after the creation is done and makes him a wife. But he points out and he takes and separates from the spirit. Now the spirit that spirit given by God not his spirit was not formed out of the earth. You understand? &gt;&gt; His spirit was not formed out of the earth. His spirit was not formed out of the creation. He was breathed in by the nostrils of God into his nostrils by the breath of God. And he became a living soul &gt;&gt; that came from God. And part of that the attributes of that spirit, the feminist attributes, and he separated the masculine from the feminist and put it into the woman. And so in spirit they're one because the spirit could never be divided. And that is why in the marriage union the two are made one &gt;&gt; by natural birth we have come it is like a byproduct. This flesh will never even though we may be here in the image of God but this flesh will never become godlike. Amen. &gt;&gt; In that sense, this flesh is weak. &gt;&gt; This flesh is perishing. &gt;&gt; This flesh will turn to dust. Do you understand that? You believe that? This flesh will not take on a god likeness in that sense of the word. But that is why it is absolutely imperative and a believer has filled becomes filled with that holy spirit of promise. The Holy Spirit from God is not something that's separated from God. It is God. &gt;&gt; And so the flesh is a byproduct &gt;&gt; because we are the bride of Christ. It's like a byproduct. &gt;&gt; That is why Jesus is the only one who could say my flesh is meat indeed and my spirit, my blood is drink indeed rather. &gt;&gt; And that is why he said to the disciples, do not go and minister. Do not go and preach. Not only because they were not empowered, but because they did not have God in them yet. Go and carry in the in the city of Jerusalem until you be endued with with power from on high. And when the Holy Spirit came, that was not a byproduct. &gt;&gt; That was God himself. &gt;&gt; And by that act, they were made one with God. &gt;&gt; And that is the unity which was in the beginning. &gt;&gt; Amen. In spirit they were one. &gt;&gt; In flesh they were two. She came after the creation. And we have come by a birth by a sexual birth. By a natural birth. And by the birth of a woman we die. But by the birth of the man Jesus Christ we live. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. In the message on one she said Eve was united with Adam. She became part of him. God created Genesis 1:27. Male and female created he them plural. Now the man was both male and female when it came to being in the spirit. The feminist and the masculine God. The feminist attributes come from God. And so he says, "Then God took from his side a rib." And did you notice the body part was a byproduct, but not the spirit? &gt;&gt; The spirit is not a byproduct. This flesh is a perishing flesh. This flesh is a problem to every sincere believer. It's a big problem. It's a negative is it as it were. And yet God has ordained that this is the form we come in. But there is a higher power and it's called the Holy Ghost. It's called the Holy Spirit. And when that spirit comes into this weakened flesh, it makes us sons and daughters of God. Not by the flesh, but by the spirit. We're made sons and daughters of God. We came as as it were by a secondary type of birth. And that's why ye must be born again &gt;&gt; and born by the Holy Spirit. And when we're born by the spirit, we take on a oneness with God. &gt;&gt; And so the body part of the woman was a byproduct after the creation had been finished. And God took from the sight of Adam a rib made a woman. Not but not the spirit. The spirit was a part of Adam. It was a part of him. You might say, well, the rib was a part of, but it was after the creation. The rib came and and it was after God had made man in his image. &gt;&gt; See, the flesh, this flesh body born by a natural birth cannot be united with God. &gt;&gt; Amen. You have to understand dust to dust, &gt;&gt; ashes to ashes. We we are going to return to dust unless we have in the in the body change. God the creator is going to uh by his his power by his creative power a sweep go over the believers. The elect of God will be changed. As apostle Paul said, "We shall not all sleep, but we shall all be changed in a moment, in the twinkling of an eye, and this body will be changed from mortal to immortality." And that is a supernatural thing. It's only going to happen once in history. &gt;&gt; It's only going to happen once from the creation. God before the before before all destruction takes place, he's going to take a people as a testimony against death. &gt;&gt; That the last enemy to be destroyed is death. And God is going to take a whole people off the earth. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; In a change of the body as a as a last testimony to this earth. &gt;&gt; And by that they bypass death. But outside of that, it's ashes to ashes, dust to dust, and ashes to ashes. This body will only be a teaspoon of ashes &gt;&gt; in the end. When wife and I were in Turkey, we saw these great stone uh they would call them caskets, but they're not. But they're used the same. And the very Greek word for them I mentioned here in a little testimony I gave is a flesh eater is what it means. And the chemicals within the stone that these are carved out of when the body is put in there. We were told that in a few days the body and this man didn't know what we believe but he said in a few days it's only some ashes in there. Just some ashes. That's all that's left. the chemistry within the flesheater. Just to think, you know, people they've had such stature and respect and they've had such accomplishments in life and some have become great businessmen and some have become artists and poets and everything and in a moment it's gone &gt;&gt; and the record of it is gone. &gt;&gt; Maybe they wrote books and whatever more, but it's gone. The image is gone. I thought how tragic that really is that it that that the world loses that. We can think of the greats all down through history and read about them and my what marvelous people uh that have have walked across the face of the earth and in a moment they're they're just vanished. They're just teaspoon of ashes. &gt;&gt; That's all that's left. Those ashes aren't God. But the spirit &gt;&gt; that's in the believer is not a byproduct. It is the very thing that causes you to be one and united with God. The spirit that's in the believer is God. The spirit indeed is willing, but the flesh is weak. All flesh is as grass. John 3:6. That which is born of the flesh is flesh. That which is born of the spirit is spirit. In first Peter 1 and 24, all flesh is as grass, and all the glory of man as the flower of grass. In Genesis, when God spoke, in the sweat of thy face shalt thou eat bread till thou return unto the ground. For out of the ground thou was taken, for dust thou art, and unto dust shalt thou return. And ever since that sentence was pronounced, there's just that unquenchable thirst within man to want to be connected, wants to be part Unity. Unity is the state of being united physically, socially, morally, and spiritually. That's unity. To unite is to join together so as to form a whole. That's to unite. But union is the act of uniting. I want you to get that very very carefully. Those of you that have ever done any, you know, plumbing or that kind of work, you have two of the same thing, two lengths of pipe, but you need something to connect them together, to make them one. And the only way they can be one is with a union. &gt;&gt; So, you have to have a union. You have to have an agent in order for the unity to happen. God used his prophets as agents. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; They were the union sir &gt;&gt; between a wayward civilization &gt;&gt; and generation and a holy God. &gt;&gt; Whether you want to accept that or not, that is the truth. &gt;&gt; And that is why God would send and Hosea was one of them. Come let us return unto the Lord. Now, unless God had had an agent to say that, not just to speak it, but he was the rallying point. &gt;&gt; He was the voice. And not only the voice, but he was the vessel through which God was issuing his voice and his thoughts. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; About them. &gt;&gt; And so often they were slain. And Jesus said the prophets were killed. Why were they killed? Because when God spoke his thoughts concerning the conditions of the people, they hated the man. Not because of his because of his uh uh physical features, but they hated him for what he was saying about them. But it wasn't him. It was God that was saved. &gt;&gt; I wonder what we would do this morning. I don't think I'm capable to perhaps say it just the way God would have it said. But if God had a vessel that just came and and uncovered by discernment by uncovered by the word where we all were living and our weaknesses and our frailties and so on so forth and just nailed it down, uh he'd either have to be our best friend or he'd be our worst enemy. &gt;&gt; We'd either have to say that is right. &gt;&gt; I confess it. That is true. Amen. &gt;&gt; You've uncovered my my deepest personal innermost being. You've uncovered it and there's no place to hide. I repent. I I I I I agree. I What must I do? &gt;&gt; And they were pricricked in their heart and said to Peter and the rest of the brethren, "What must we do to be saved?" Amen. &gt;&gt; And Peter said,"Repent &gt;&gt; and be baptized, every one of you, in the name of Jesus Christ, and thou shalt receive the gift of the Holy Spirit." In other words, repent and you shall be brought into union with God. &gt;&gt; You shall be made one. &gt;&gt; But there was a process and God had his agent. Now, Brother Brand says the agent is the Holy Spirit. That's exactly true. But the Holy Spirit has to have a vessel that he can move through. And there has been no vessel like it since the time of Christ that we've had in this day in the prophet of God in this generation. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And so there must be this act. And the word that kept coming to my mind is one that's not used over the pulpit very much, but I want you to listen to it closely. And those of you that are have been have trades and are and maybe even those of you that just go down to Home Depot and get something, there's something that's called a catalyst. And you can get a certain kind of a glue, a certain kind of a cement. And the very high grades of of those cements which which fuse and merge together and will not separate are most commonly activated by a catalyst. &gt;&gt; And you'll get a little tube that'll be a catalyst. And I was very very uh curious and interested to find out that what a catalyst does. It says that the catalyst remains stable. It does not change. But the catalyst has a certain qualities, certain properties that accelerates the merging and the union of the other and makes it one. And I thought, isn't that marvelous? We had to have a catalyst. We had to have somebody who could speak and accelerate within us the desire to be made one with God. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And even when that catalyst, that agent would say, "You have sinned. You are wayward. You're lukewarm. &gt;&gt; Leodya, Leodya, how often I would have gathered you as a hen gathers her chicks." Which he did say, and that's being repeated now. Jesus said that. But the son of man being revealed has a mouthpiece saying the same thing once again to a weward generation. And oh, how weward we are. I'm not negative people. I'm a very positive person. But I tell you before God, if we could see things in the balance that they are, you would say, as I have said, even today, we're walking in the midst of an insane asylum. &gt;&gt; This is an insane society. And things that are taking place that Satan would impose upon you as the norm is not normal whatsoever. It is total insanity. Amen. &gt;&gt; The attitude and uh what takes place. I don't want to even try to describe it. I do not have the words. But it is an insanity. &gt;&gt; The way people dress is an insanity. &gt;&gt; The way people appear, the way people mutilate their bodies is an insanity. The way people mark themselves up, the way people their attitude towards one another is an insanity. &gt;&gt; And the prophet said he'd be walking the streets. And I tell you, we're there. &gt;&gt; We've arrived. &gt;&gt; In case you don't think that, you need to get near to the presence of God on your knees or in some quiet place. And you'll soon agree. It's an insane generation that we're in. Every once in a while, we speak about you young families. My wife and I, we wonder if we were young, would we even want to have children? &gt;&gt; The most blessed thing that you can have, would we want to have children? I tell you what, I would only want to have them knowing that my feet were well anchored into the promises of God in this generation. Outside of that, there isn't any hope. Outside of that, there isn't any way to keep them and hold them. And I tell you, my brother, my sister, in the event that you think that you've lost a son or a daughter, you have an anchor, you have a faith, you have a message that is holding true. &gt;&gt; And I have more to say about that. If you believe, nothing shall be impossible to them that believe. &gt;&gt; Believest thou this? &gt;&gt; Believest thou this? Today, now. Amen. And those of you with young family, you need to wait till they're 17, 18, 20 and see where they're going and see where they're headed. And when they head the wrong direction, then you have to know where your faith is anchored. &gt;&gt; It's not just a hope. So, &gt;&gt; it's not just some frivolous thing, but it is you have to know in whom you have believed and that this one must come because I am a son or a daughter of God, and I will not let them go. God's agent, the catalyst. Let me just say it this way. God sent the prophet of God in this generation to unite the bride to the bridegroom. And quite frankly, if that was the agent, which I am thoroughly convinced of, if that was the catalyst, there's no other way for it to happen. &gt;&gt; God never says, "Well, I'll send this, but in case you don't like it, there'll be some other ways." No. &gt;&gt; God say, "This is it. &gt;&gt; This is me. I'm speaking. This is thus says the Lord and it's not thus sayith the Lord over here and maybe it's over there and maybe it's over there and maybe it's elsewhere. This is the voice of God &gt;&gt; and it won't come to your taste. It won't come to your, you know, it doesn't have to come through your filter or anybody else's filter. God does it the way he wishes to do it. Amen. &gt;&gt; In the message perfect faith, he says, "And now we become anointed with the same spirit, anointed messiahs, messiahs of the last day to shine forth the resurrection of Jesus Christ to show that he is not dead, but in the form of the Holy Ghost, he's in his people." &gt;&gt; Amen. moving among his bride with a love affair to her, pouring out into her &gt;&gt; himself. Hallelujah. He says they are becoming one for the wedding supper. And the same signs just please listen very very close and attentive promised by the same God in the word is making his making the same manifestations. And I just want to I want you to know unequivocally there was no other manifestation like the manifestation brother Brandham's ministry by any other person. Not because I'm saying it. That is a record. That is historical. That is something that God did and all the world has had to acknowledge it. &gt;&gt; Now, if you look at it just in a on a superficial way, my words won't have a whole lot of weight to you, but you listen now, please. The same signs promised by the same God in the same word is making his same manifestation. There's nothing left for us to do but to believe it. &gt;&gt; And to believe it is the substance and that creates a perfect faith. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He says now the same one, it's not a stranger off somewhere. The same one, he's speaking of this Christ. He said he's here. He's here and does this to create a perfect faith. He said, "I feel him." Now, the audience perhaps didn't. I feel him and I know that he's here now. I know that his spirit is here. I know that he knows all things. Amen. And I know he wants to do something. He's been doing something to create this perfection of faith in the people. Another one, please. He asked a question and I feel I ask it this morning. I was going to I was going to avoid this not for the sake of avoiding it but I just thought that I would like to have carried on with the same theme. But he asked this question. Are we going to walk into eternity like the days of Noah when there were eight? The days of Lot and Sodom when there were three? Or the days of John the Baptist with six believers. Let us believe for his works are perfect. They're manifested daily, perfectly before us, showing that he is the word, and the word is the discerner of the thoughts and intents of the heart. My friends, the message which we hold to is not merely some other teaching as opposed to everyone else's teaching. There is no vindication. There is no you can take any church organization and incidentally the denominations and church organizations all with one voice declare or imply that we are the unifying power. We can connect you with God. And I can tell you it's a false claim. They claim to be the agent. We are the catalyst. step into our organization or step into our web. I would say more correctly. Step into our net &gt;&gt; and we will put you in touch with the living God and through our method through our belief we'll put you in touch with God. Can you believe that millions unto untold millions of churches are claiming to put people in touch with God and will not take them to water in the name of Jesus Christ? &gt;&gt; Deny it and war against it and fight against it and will not baptize people in the name of the precious Lord Jesus Christ who is the only name and the only access to the father. And they're saying, "We'll unite you with the father, but we will not call his name out even when you go down in the similitude of his burial." Right? &gt;&gt; Like the old brother in India said, "Was the father did the was the father buried for you? Was the father crucified for you?" No, the father wasn't crucified. Jesus Christ the son was crucified. &gt;&gt; He was the one who was buried. He was the one who was resurrected and going into that water. For those of you going to be baptized tonight, you are you're living now. You're going to die there. I'm going to bury you or somebody's going to bury you in the name of Jesus Christ into the tomb and rise up out of the watery grave to walk in newness of life. Not by some uh uh uh super emotional experience but by the coming of the Holy Spirit. Why would the spirit come? Is because you have acted according to the word &gt;&gt; and it's the spirit that is not the byproduct. He is God. &gt;&gt; And he will take a clay, a portion of clay of this earth that came by a a sexual bar, came by a secondary way as it were, and fill that vessel &gt;&gt; with &gt;&gt; with something that's not separated from God, &gt;&gt; but is a part of God. the word made flesh and just as this is just as as it was it's rushing up through brother Brandham in in his prophetic office to the word made flesh. Hallelujah. The word operating in human flesh by physical signs by material signs by scriptural signs perfectly. In other words, what was this whole ministry? He said to bring to you a perfect faith for a perfect rapture. Amen. &gt;&gt; I want to major on this morning. This congregation, believers of this message have received the agent of God, the catalyst, that which activates and accelerates something within the individual, a faith, a something that is laying there, a seed, an eternal seed that could not be satisfied. ified by anything in the world. You could not be satisfied. You've tried this and you've tried that. And throughout this audience of people this morning, we've tried just about everything. &gt;&gt; Every church, every kind of belief in religion and non-religion and came to the conclusion there's nothing that can satisfy the soul. There's a lot that, you know, might appease us, but it's not a satisfying portion. &gt;&gt; As the eagle stirth his nest, he said, "My ministry," now you hear it from him, "is a ministry trying to unite the body of Christ together." &gt;&gt; Not unite denominations to one another. Not trying to unite denominations to another denomination, but to unite brothers and sisters in one group of people in one in purpose, one in heart, one in unity. &gt;&gt; That was the purpose. And so the Holy Spirit is the unifying force. Now, I hope you don't mind me using these quotes. I'm using more than perhaps I usually do because I want to be very, very definitive today. Have you followed me thus far? &gt;&gt; He said, because now I want to return to this. Because Adam and his bride taken from his body, Christ has his bride taken from his body. And when Christ died, there was three elements that came from his body. Water, blood, and spirit. Justification through believing, water, sanctification through the blood, and baptism of the Holy Spirit. Now this last great step must come into the perfection that the Holy Spirit has to live in that church so perfectly. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Has to live within that so perfectly in Mary's belief. He promised in the last days and then I've got some slides I want to show you. He promised in the last days that the church would grow so close from the days of Luther justification, Wesley sanctification, the days of Pentecost, which is the restoration of the gifts right into the headstone. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And through that through that would bring forth the whole body, the resurrection of every believer. &gt;&gt; You know these words are so powerful. Amen. &gt;&gt; So powerful. But as the spirit of God grows closer, just like the shadow of my hand, the shadow gets darker and darker and darker until the shadow and the hand become the same thing. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; If you hold your hand up, you got a shadow against the wall. You move your hand towards the shadow. Towards the shadow. This is the positive. That's the negative. But when you move it closer and closer closer, it gets right to the wall. Then the shadow, the negative and the positive become one. &gt;&gt; And you do not see the negative anymore. You only see the positive. &gt;&gt; And that is what this ministry was all about. That God came down and through an agent, through a catalyst, through a vessel, reflected himself. And it got it went from a first pull to a second pull to a third pull because God is not just miracles. His attribute is miracles. God is not just the revealing of the secrets of the heart. But what God is is word. &gt;&gt; And so finally God had to say speak through it. Not say you're sick, you're from a certain city, you have a certain disease, you're praying for a certain person. Like you said to a woman I heard the other day, take that handkerchief that your tear just dropped off on and take it to that person. They'll be well. It those are all wonderful. Those are blessings. Those are attributes. But that's not it, my brother, my sister. God is word. In the beginning was the &gt;&gt; word &gt;&gt; and the word was with God. &gt;&gt; And the word was &gt;&gt; and the word was &gt;&gt; the word is God. And so when that vessel finally begins to speak and say, "Thus saith the Lord," &gt;&gt; that now is not a blessing anymore. That's not just an attribute anymore. That is God coming forth. That's his breath coming forth. That's his life coming forth. And all the attributes are in that. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; God, that's his spirit. And that's why the when you receive that The Holy Ghost comes to that. &gt;&gt; Doesn't come to marry, John, Susie, and and all the rest of it. It doesn't matter what your name is. Doesn't matter where you were born. Doesn't matter what nationality you are. Doesn't matter what your physical stature appears as. It comes, the Holy Spirit comes to that heart that believes. [Music] The Bible says that Jesus he was seen of above 500 brethren after his sac after his crucifixion and only 120 of the 500 went to the upper room. &gt;&gt; Jesus did not say to the apostles and you've heard me say it many times. Jesus did not say to the apostles, Peter, you be sure that you're there. John, James, Andrew, make sure you're there. You must be there. Make sure my mother is there. Make sure Mary is there. He never said any of those things. He just said it. &gt;&gt; Go and Terry &gt;&gt; the word of God. &gt;&gt; And 380 had other things to do. &gt;&gt; 380 had things to take care of. I can't go. I got responsibilities. I got a family. I've got this. I've got that. I can't go. So when the Holy Spirit come, the Holy Spirit didn't come to John or Andrew or Mary or someone else. The Holy Spirit came to the word &gt;&gt; and they were the ones who heard the word and took it into their bosom and were there waiting caring for the Holy Spirit and the Holy Spirit come to the word. And so in this day and age when the believer when a person who says I'm a believer here's thus says the Lord one says I got to think that over. He's not going to come to what you think over. &gt;&gt; I got to figure that out. He's not going to come to what you figured out. But to that one who says I may not understand it. I can't put it together, but I do believe it. &gt;&gt; And the Holy Spirit says, I will come to that. I will come to that. I will come to that heart. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And the Holy Spirit comes and that is oneness with God. &gt;&gt; Now full unity has taken place and the catalyst has has activated and accelerated the little bit of faith that was in your heart and you believed it. and you're made one with God. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; This is not the doing of man. &gt;&gt; This is God's doing and it's marvelous in our eyes. &gt;&gt; Can we have slide one? The word oneness. How long's that been up there? &gt;&gt; Just now. Thanks, brother Roger. The word oneness means to be one with oneness, united. He said, "This is teaching doctrine." So, what I've been saying this morning is not just some, you know, little light message or something that I think will fit a Wednesday or a Sunday morning service. This, he said, is doctrine. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Study it prayerfully and carefully. Weigh it out in the balance of God's word to see whether it be of God or not. Slide two. That's God's purpose. And his purpose as father supreme was to be one with his family, earthly family, Adam and Eve. And the only way that they could be one with the family. The only way they could be one with the family or with God was because God's nature was in them. Notice how Paul said in in uh uh Ephesians that we were by nature the children of wrath. But now God, he's going to take that nature out from you. I'm not just talking about, you know, some of our natural characteristics and idiosyncrasies. I'm talking about the very nature of God. Hallelujah. We're made new creatures in Christ Jesus. &gt;&gt; Oh, we need to preach this message with force and with power. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Because God's nature was in them. So that made them with God's nature in them. Then with each other and God, they became all one. The next slide speaks of the h of the scripture I just referred to among whom also we all had our conversation in times past in the lust of our flesh fulfilling the desires of the flesh and of the mind and where by nature the children of wrath even as others Ephesians 2 and3 it says in times past so that's not to be now in times past. &gt;&gt; Next slide, please. He said, "Now, isn't that a a beautiful picture? God in his family, father overall, supreme. No death, no sorrow, no heartaches, no nothing, just joy, unspeakable, never to be sick, never to have a heartache, just one with God." What a picture. Because the very nature of God was in these people and therefore what they did they followed just in line with God and God with them made them one. &gt;&gt; What's the next slide please? Uh the first man and the first woman in the garden of Eden was in perfect harmony with God. So much so that God could come down in any time at any time he desired and talk lip to ear with Adam and Eve. Now that is perfect oneness. &gt;&gt; Let me just stop there and have you not look at the screen, but just watch me for a moment. Please have your attention. I believe God should be able to speak to us at any time. &gt;&gt; At any time. Amen. &gt;&gt; You might be over the sink in the morning just washing. &gt;&gt; You ladies may be just getting breakfast. You may be in the laundry. You could be in the bedroom making the beds or some tedious task. But you should never lose the awareness that God at any moment &gt;&gt; could just step in. You say, "Well, he's always there." Yes, but in I'm I'm speaking of in a special way for fellowship. &gt;&gt; In other words, God who know who fills all time and space. He said when Jesus was here, he only asked for one thing, fellowship. &gt;&gt; You might not be aware of it just now sitting here, but do you know that the scripture says of Jesus And he was alone. And he went and he was alone. And when he came to the crisis of his life, which was the garden, &gt;&gt; and the crowds had left him. And the powerful ministry was gone. Not from him, but from ministering to the people. They were gone. He lost 4,988 with just a short short message. He preached a short message and 4,988 left him. And that was when he turned to the disciples and said, "Would you leave also? &gt;&gt; To whom shall we go? For thou hast the words of eternal life." But when he came to the garden where the prophet said the spirit actually left him, he didn't have that sustaining. He went as a man. &gt;&gt; He went like you or I to Calvary. He walked as a man to Calvary. &gt;&gt; Yes, he did. &gt;&gt; And he went and he was alone. He asked the three, "Come and tarry with me and wait with me God in flesh." But he desired the companionship of those that he had he had spoken to so personally and privately. those that he loved, not necessarily more than others, but those that he shared deeper things with. It might be at your job. Could be at any moment. could be in the m in the very midst of your most intense occupation of your whole being and your mind and all of your faculties and you're just so intense upon something and you'll just sense you become aware of another presence. &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham is catching a plane. He told me this account and I'm going to close because I'm not even halfway done. is going to catch a plane. The plane was brought down on account of a snowstorm into Memphis, Tennessee. And they had to overnight the passengers. And in the morning, he had some things he wanted to mail. I think some cards that he had written. He wanted to mail the cards. And so he's just going downstairs through the lobby. He's going to mail his cards. walks out onto the street going down the street to find a place to post the cards, comes to a corner, says there's a policeman standing there, just standing there and he hears just a little something. Keep walking. He said he actually turned there was a store and he looked in the window of the store so he could just say, "Father, is that you?" He's not he's not making preparation to do any great act or thing. He's on his way to mail some cards. He's waiting to catch a plane in just a short few moments. And there's a little something, just a little something inside. Keep walking. So he keeps on walking. Come to another block. Keep walking. kept walking. He told me he kept walking just every at at just certain intervals. He wondered is he there? Is he there? And he just kept walking. Keep walking. Said finally he got into the area that was a colored area of the city of Memphis and he kept walking. It was early morning. Looks down the street. There's a large colored woman. She's leaning on the fence. And he walks past her, says, "Good morning, auntie." Says, "Morning, Parson." He stopped. He said, "How do you know I was a preacher?" "How'd you know I was a parson?" She said, "I was praying early this morning &gt;&gt; and I saw a man just like you come by, only he was carrying a a case, a briefcase." He says, "I have one. It's back at the hotel." He said, "My name's William Brandham. Have you been in my meetings or something? You know me?" "No," she said. I don't know you, but I was praying this morning and I saw you coming by and I've been waiting for you. She said, "I got a son." She said, "Parson Brandom, he's a good boy, but he got into some bad company. He's got a social disease and he's dying. They've sent him home from the hospital to die. Says, uh, he's inside. Brother Brandon walks in. He told me said the walls were papered with newspapers. She didn't have wallpaper. said, "Over the door, I saw a little sign, God bless our home, and there was a big tall colored boy." And he's groaning, "Oh, oh, so dark in here," he said. It's so dark in here. And he's rising on this bed. So dark in here. And she says, "Parson Brandon, will you pray for him?" Yes. He said, "He took a hold of his feet and they were already cold. Death, they were cold and clammy. Death had already come on him and was moving up through his body. He was in a state of dying at that moment." says he looked up at her says a big full th cheeks tears coming down her cheeks and she was patting him on the cheek says mama's boy mama's boy Brandon prayed a simple prayer that God would heal him touch him raise him up says and in a few moments he says mama I see a little light. &gt;&gt; That was it. Brother Brandham slipped out, went quickly back to his hotel, was just going through the lobby, and they said, "Oh, Reverend Brandom, they're looking for you." Cuz the plane was delayed. It didn't even get off. And God held it up. And he got on that on the plane he was supposed to get on. But then he turned to me and says, "Brother Eddie," believe me, I was listening. He said, "Do you know what brought that airplane down in a snowstorm the day before? Do you know what brought that airplane down?" I said, "No." He said, "That woman's love." That woman's love brought an airplane down out of the sky &gt;&gt; and caused an Elijah prophet to come by her way and she was out there waiting for him. And that she said she was all wet from the dew. She'd been there all through the early morning. I tell you, my brother, my sister, God had a voice. God had something that would answer to that kind of perfect faith that woman had. And years later, he was getting on a train and a young man come running up. He was a colored young man, just beautiful in his features said, "Oh, Brother Brandham, Brother Brandham." He said, "Do I you know me?" "Yeah." He said, "You prayed for me years ago when I was dying." He said, "I'm now a Sunday school teacher. I believe in a Baptist church. &gt;&gt; God had raised him up. You know friends, this God that we speak about and this message that we speak about, this is a supernatural gospel. &gt;&gt; And I want you to be able to go out of this place today knowing of assurityity that God, this message, when you say message, I want you to think of this phrase, unifying force. unifying force. This is a power that's not dependent upon how good you are or what you do, but it is on what you believe. &gt;&gt; And if we can say, Lord, I believe. &gt;&gt; Not just this part and that part and my selective part, but I believe the word that you have sent, I can say to you, the Holy Ghost will come to that word. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Then you say, "What happens then? Do I get a good feeling? Do I get Oh, no. Don't worry about the feeling." That's not what we're interested in. When the Holy Ghost comes to the word, there is a union that takes place. There's a chemistry that takes place. And he said that can never be separated from God. It's not something that's just given of God. That is why friends, that is why it was so well explained to me and I'm so thankful for it. Brother Brandham took his pen went like this to me. He said, "Brother Eddie, this is a gift of William Brandham. This is not William Brham." &gt;&gt; And then I understand there's a big difference between the gift of the Holy Ghost or the gift of the Holy Ghost and the Holy Ghost himself. Amen. &gt;&gt; I'm not interested in just receiving a gift of the Holy Ghost. I want him himself. &gt;&gt; I want him the person &gt;&gt; of God. &gt;&gt; It's not another one. &gt;&gt; It's not even a part of God. It's not a third person. It is the person. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. That comes into you and you are fused into one family. Amen. &gt;&gt; I could become a renegade. I could disgrace my family. I could drag my father's name into the mud. I could be the worst criminal, the worst addict, the worst anything. I could be a scumball of the world. But I can never I can never separate myself from being Fred Biscll's son. &gt;&gt; His life is in me and I cannot separate it. And if that happens at the human level, how much more at the eternal level, my brother, my sister, and God, there had to be a certain agent. There had to be a way that I could come into the world. And there is no other way. &gt;&gt; It came by a birth. My father's seed entered into my mother's womb. And as a result of conception took place and you were born into this world. &gt;&gt; If that happened in the natural, how much more in the spiritual and that that can never be reversed. My father can't reverse it. My mother can't reverse it. Nobody can reverse it. No matter who what I have done or what it is. And I can say to you on the order of God's word, on the authority of God's word, there's nothing that can separate us from the love of God in Christ Jesus. You tell that devil he has no right to be in your territory. &gt;&gt; What can separate you from the love of God? &gt;&gt; Death, no. Life, no. Nothing can separate. He has torn &gt;&gt; and he will heal. &gt;&gt; He has smitten and he will bind up. &gt;&gt; He is God. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Say that. He is God. &gt;&gt; He is God. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; He has torn &gt;&gt; and he will heal. &gt;&gt; Glory to God. Isn't that Isn't that the song you sing, Sister Margaret? He is torn. Hallelujah. and he will heal. He has smitten. This is a sovereign God. &gt;&gt; Glory to God. &gt;&gt; You think I'm excited about this message? I'm not near as excited as I ought to be. When you think the almighty God dames to come down amongst us and be united with you as an individual, oh I say, what is man that darn mindful of him or the son of man that thou considerest him? &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Glory to God. &gt;&gt; I'm here to give my breath and my lips and my tongue to say praise be to God. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; This whole congregation should with a one voice say praise be to God. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Let's give him praise. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; He is torn. He is healed. &gt;&gt; He's almighty God. &gt;&gt; He's made us one with him. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Almighty God. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Glory to God. &gt;&gt; He's God. &gt;&gt; And there's none like him. There's none beside him. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Oh God, how great thou art. How great thou art. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; United. &gt;&gt; United with the Almighty. &gt;&gt; There is nothing else, oh God, that could unite us. Nothing. &gt;&gt; Nothing. &gt;&gt; It's not just an experience. It's an act of almighty God. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. You have performed this mighty operation. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; We thank you. &gt;&gt; Bless the people, oh God. Bless the people, I pray. &gt;&gt; Shall we stand to our feet? &gt;&gt; Then sings my soul, my savior God to thee.

Would you please just quite coordinate things in case there's someone We'd like you to have a a rest as quickly as possible. We'd like to be start the service at 4:30. I realize it's a little short, but it'll be better for everyone, I believe. And just before we pray, I want to just maybe sing one verse, two verses at the most of down from his glory.
