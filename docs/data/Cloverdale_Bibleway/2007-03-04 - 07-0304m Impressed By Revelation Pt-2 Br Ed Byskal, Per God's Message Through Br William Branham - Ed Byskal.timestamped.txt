[0:12] he I have
[0:14] AER and
[0:15] [Applause]
[0:17] [Music]
[0:25] I and
[0:28] Before Time begin
[0:31] my life in his
[0:35] hands oh he know he knows
[0:41] my he knows he know
[0:45] [Music]
[0:55] my AR you glad that he know
[1:01] [Music]
[1:02] thank you
[1:04] [Music]
[1:17] Lord oh I'm so glad you
[1:24] [Music]
[1:26] know he knows my
[1:45] that's our
[1:46] God
[1:47] Allelujah we'd be a sad group of people
[1:52] we didn't have that confidence that kind
[1:55] of a God to come to amen are you happy
[2:00] happy you're a
[2:02] Believer amen that's
[2:07] wonderful I want to make a couple of uh
[2:11] announcements and uh sometimes these
[2:15] things aren't immediately understood
[2:17] right at the beginning but sometimes as
[2:20] a pastor you have to just ask for things
[2:23] to be done in a certain way and uh I've
[2:27] noticed that you know over the years
[2:30] from being a small Church we've always
[2:32] had written requests and requests have
[2:34] come up and we've taken time to read
[2:35] them and and as time goes on the
[2:38] requests become more and more and more
[2:40] and more and more more detailed and
[2:43] sometimes difficult to get to all of
[2:45] them and I whenever I have a a question
[2:47] come up my mind I always just go back to
[2:49] the message and listen to what happened
[2:51] in the prophet services and they just
[2:54] didn't do it that way and so I'm not
[2:56] going to I'm going to ask that we
[2:58] refrain from written requests that
[3:00] expect to be read I know that that you
[3:03] know for some say well I want the whole
[3:05] congregation to know but that's
[3:07] wonderful I mean I'm glad you have that
[3:09] kind of a burden but the thing to do is
[3:12] and what they did do is they brought
[3:13] aprons and they brought handkerchiefs
[3:16] they brought cloths and if you want a
[3:19] loved one prayed for or you want
[3:22] something special done you bring that
[3:24] and and the minister will lay hands on
[3:27] it here and that's what they did in the
[3:29] meetings and I think that's the pattern
[3:31] we need to follow and otherwise it just
[3:33] goes on and we have announcements about
[3:36] this and announcement about that and and
[3:38] we take up a lot of precious time that
[3:40] can be taken for the word of God and not
[3:43] that these aren't important they're very
[3:45] very important then if there's a
[3:47] something really critical and Urgent a a
[3:49] written request that's fine that's what
[3:51] we want to take time for or or or
[3:55] someone that uh we we get testimonies as
[3:58] well and we read this testimony read
[4:00] that testimony that's lovely but I think
[4:02] if we have a testimony and you want to
[4:04] thank the Lord for it and then people
[4:06] will get in the habit of just writing it
[4:09] out and putting it on the notice board
[4:11] and let people stand there and read it
[4:13] and rejoice with you otherwise you know
[4:16] we we just take up a great deal of time
[4:18] service after service after service and
[4:21] I just feel to follow the pattern that
[4:23] the prophet of God had in his meetings
[4:25] is that all right I trust you can say
[4:27] Amen to that and and uh next Sunday next
[4:32] Sunday evening we're not going to have a
[4:35] service we're cancelling next Sunday's
[4:37] regular service and the reason for that
[4:40] is we need to have a meeting of all of
[4:45] those in the congregation that feel that
[4:48] they would like to contribute or at
[4:50] least make themselves available to
[4:53] contribute a volunteer time for the
[4:56] upcoming conference in in July
[5:00] we need we need to have that meeting we
[5:02] need to actually have it urgently so we
[5:05] want to have that meeting next Sunday
[5:07] evening and I think maybe 5:00 will be
[5:10] all right too brother Tom we'll just
[5:12] meet at
[5:13] 5: and uh here are the
[5:17] areas that uh we we will have team
[5:19] leaders appointed but here are the areas
[5:22] that we will be needing assistance with
[5:26] uh number one with accommodation
[5:30] and in the accommodation we have an A
[5:33] and B portion of that and one is there
[5:36] will be buting that'll be taking place
[5:39] in homes that
[5:42] involves having a a list of homes and
[5:46] what each home can
[5:49] accommodate and uh uh and and then
[5:52] matching people to those homes that's
[5:55] very involved it takes a lot of time
[5:58] secondly under abating under
[6:00] accommodation will be the people that
[6:04] will be going to hotels some ministers
[6:06] are going to Hotel some people will want
[6:08] to make their own arrangements and so
[6:11] even to let them know now we've got a
[6:13] website that's already up and uh brother
[6:16] Darren and some of the brothers working
[6:18] with him we have a website that is 2007
[6:24] convention and it's a beautiful website
[6:27] and that is for people anywhere in the
[6:29] world that can click on they can get the
[6:31] accommodation and list of the hotels Etc
[6:33] but we have a lot of ministers from
[6:36] different parts of the world and North
[6:38] America that we are uh assisting and
[6:41] working with and looking after so that's
[6:43] the accommodation and even though we
[6:44] have a team leader in the accommodation
[6:47] he's going to need several people to
[6:49] assist him and then under
[6:53] transportation and we have two areas of
[6:56] Transportation there will be ministers
[6:57] that'll be scattered throughout the area
[6:59] and people and we want to be able to
[7:02] have arrangements made so that those
[7:04] people those that are in private
[7:07] residences that we will have perhaps one
[7:11] one person with a a van or one person
[7:14] with a car all right these are your
[7:16] responsibility and and here's the
[7:18] meeting times and these pastors will
[7:21] need to get you know to the church at 9
[7:23] in the morning get back or have uh some
[7:26] lunch whatever and these will be your
[7:29] responsibility so that is why we will be
[7:32] using a lot of different bodies but
[7:35] there'll be people who will be in charge
[7:36] who we need to have held responsible and
[7:40] then uh also transportation from the
[7:43] various hotels and so
[7:46] on uh because of the international
[7:50] nature of of this area and of this
[7:53] church there are people coming from many
[7:56] many different countries and the
[7:58] immigration
[8:00] the immigration requirements are not the
[8:02] same as they were before
[8:04] 911 the the reality is Everything's
[8:07] changed and you that cross the border
[8:09] back and forth you're well aware of that
[8:12] and we have brothers from different
[8:14] countries in fact is as far as canidate
[8:16] concerned we are requiring people to
[8:20] have visas now that did not require
[8:23] visas just a few years ago and so they
[8:26] have to apply to get visas sometimes
[8:28] they can wait for weeks or months to get
[8:30] a visa and we're only a few months away
[8:34] from the convention right now and it's
[8:36] it's nothing we understand brother Tony
[8:38] was telling me that a someone from India
[8:41] waited I think seven months and never
[8:43] did get the visa in time for the meeting
[8:46] so we have that to consider and uh and
[8:50] and this is not this is not a service
[8:52] we'll provide but we want to assist
[8:54] people and perhaps direct them to the
[8:58] right to the right uh Department also
[9:01] with some of the ministers we I have
[9:03] been writing and we've been for the last
[9:05] week and a half we've been sending out
[9:07] letters from the church office with
[9:10] invitation and these kind of invitations
[9:13] are just so that you know what we have
[9:14] to go through I just want to share it
[9:16] with the congregation we don't just sit
[9:18] in the office you know and and send out
[9:20] little notes uh we get we get word back
[9:23] from one of the consulate one of the
[9:25] Canadian consulate office wants to wants
[9:28] uh want the in official information of
[9:31] the church uh the our society status
[9:35] they want our bank account they want our
[9:38] financial statement because we have to
[9:40] take full responsibility for some of
[9:42] these people and our invitation say that
[9:45] we will look after this individual their
[9:49] complete
[9:50] accommodation uh their food and any
[9:53] medical needs that they might have while
[9:55] they're in this country that's what we
[9:57] have to assume when we invite uh uh the
[10:01] ministers especially that are coming so
[10:03] it's a it's a it's a big thing and we
[10:05] just can't take all the calls in the
[10:07] office so we need people to assist us in
[10:10] that and the next thing
[10:13] will uh involve some of the uh perhaps
[10:17] some of the sisters maybe with people
[10:20] like our brother Raymond young uh we
[10:24] need people that can take responsibility
[10:26] with the feeding we're not going to feed
[10:28] everyone but but we are going to have
[10:30] perhaps at least two ministers luncheons
[10:33] if not three and so I I am determined to
[10:37] allow the ministers to have as much time
[10:40] together so they're not just passing
[10:42] each other in the hallways I want the
[10:45] ministers from Brazil to meet the
[10:46] ministers from the Philippines and and
[10:49] the brothers from India to meet the
[10:51] brothers from the Ukraine and so on and
[10:54] I think that is a very very important
[10:57] thing and uh right now we have uh
[11:01] Brethren who have already notified us
[11:04] and this is uh we're way ahead but
[11:08] Brother G rald from bebber Germany will
[11:11] be coming brother Harold hilderbrand
[11:12] from Edmonton is the usually they have a
[11:16] convention in in in July and they have
[11:19] cancelled their convention this year to
[11:21] join with us in the convention here
[11:23] brother Tim Dodd from Grand Prairie
[11:26] brother Donnie Reagan is coming with we
[11:29] have brother uh brother uh Moses coming
[11:33] from India and several Brothers probably
[11:36] six or more from Brazil that want to
[11:39] come but we have to get the they have to
[11:41] get their documents together as quickly
[11:43] as
[11:44] possible uh and we want to have these
[11:46] brothers together as as much as possible
[11:50] then we have the internet streaming
[11:52] services the that F that uh internet
[11:56] streaming of the live services and and
[11:59] uh we have the Brethren who are in
[12:02] charge of that but they will need all
[12:04] kinds of go for people and and
[12:07] assistance uh then we have in the
[12:09] missions Department to work with brother
[12:12] Tony and brother Derek Paris uh there's
[12:15] a lot to do with regards to the missions
[12:18] and we need uh we need brothers and
[12:21] sisters also that will be able to assist
[12:25] in those areas and we just need to we
[12:27] may not be able to use everybody but we
[12:29] we want to be able to say here's an
[12:31] opportunity and the reason why we like
[12:33] to get all of these things looked after
[12:34] and get them really cared for by people
[12:37] who are fully responsible to see it move
[12:41] ahead is because uh I personally want to
[12:43] have my mind just on the ministry part
[12:46] who's going to minister and the services
[12:49] and I just like to be completely given
[12:52] over to that and I'm sure that you
[12:54] understand
[12:57] that uh
[13:00] you may want to just chart these down if
[13:03] you're
[13:05] interested uh Pastor Mundo in
[13:08] Ottawa is having the
[13:11] dedication of their
[13:13] Church uh is the sixth 7th and eth of
[13:18] April so that's next
[13:21] month and I think he may even have the
[13:23] meetings earlier he may be starting them
[13:25] as early as the 3D I don't have an
[13:27] official announcement but we've been
[13:30] speaking on the phone and I do know that
[13:33] the 8th Sunday the 8th is the official
[13:36] dedication time for the church this
[13:39] church is really quite
[13:42] unique and it has gained the attention
[13:45] of uh of a lot of shall I
[13:49] say uh decision makers and people in
[13:52] government in in some fairly high places
[13:55] I understand right to the uh prime
[13:58] minister of Canada himself they're very
[14:00] interested in this church because it has
[14:03] been built by largely new Canadians
[14:06] immigrants to Canada and it's kind of
[14:09] one of its kind it it's like something
[14:12] that's never happened before and I
[14:14] understand members of parliament plan to
[14:17] attend and there's a possibility the
[14:19] Prime Minister himself will attend uh
[14:22] some City counselors are planning to
[14:25] attend attorneys and different people
[14:28] well that's fine I I'd be happy if they
[14:30] want to come and hear the hear what the
[14:33] message is all about but uh brother
[14:37] Mundo would like us to pray especially
[14:40] he you can understand the position that
[14:41] he's in and he wants us to really pray
[14:44] for those uh that dedication I will be
[14:46] speaking the dedication meetings on the
[14:49] 8th on Sunday the
[14:50] 8th on May the 26 27th and 28 is in
[14:58] bezburuah was having the pent Pentecost
[15:01] special at that week and July the 20th
[15:05] the 21st and the 22 that's just after
[15:08] our convention brother Roy Shrewsbury is
[15:12] having dedication of their church I had
[15:14] a l lengthy conversation with him
[15:17] yesterday and uh one of the things you
[15:20] know he wasn't talking about the
[15:21] construction of the church so much in
[15:23] fact as we hardly talked about it at all
[15:26] uh he'd like us to pray for sister
[15:28] Shrewsbury she's been in the hospital
[15:30] about two weeks over two weeks 18 days
[15:33] uh with uh with pneumonia and you know
[15:36] she just uh quite up in years and she's
[15:39] very very frail but what a trooper what
[15:42] a soldier she is she she she had been
[15:45] home and and just a frail little person
[15:49] and when we went down there last time
[15:51] she wanted to come to church and she sat
[15:53] at the orgon and played the whole
[15:55] service and came back at night and
[15:57] played I didn't know she was even
[16:00] capable of sitting up that long and I
[16:02] just said you know God bless people like
[16:04] that that spirit is so fervent even
[16:07] though the flesh is weak the spirit is
[16:09] Welling and uh so we want to remember
[16:11] our sister shrewbury brother shrewbury
[16:13] he is held he's stood right by the
[16:16] doctors and they told him your wife is
[16:20] dying he said she can't she can't die
[16:24] because God has given her as a help meat
[16:26] and I'm not done with her and I still
[16:28] need her
[16:29] and uh he said she's going to come out
[16:31] of here and she's going to live and
[16:34] that's been a probably three years ago
[16:36] and every time she goes in they think
[16:38] she's going to die and and until brother
[16:41] shrewsbury's done she's just not going
[16:43] to
[16:44] go he told me that there was a man that
[16:47] came to know the Lord Jesus in the light
[16:50] of this message at their church I think
[16:54] probably in the last
[16:56] year that man when he was four years old
[17:01] had a diseased eye and they actually
[17:04] took his eye out he said his eye was
[17:06] hanging down on his cheek while they
[17:09] operated uh back in the eye socket of
[17:12] his left eye and he was not able they
[17:16] were not able to regain his sight and
[17:19] he'd been absolutely blind since he was
[17:22] 4 years
[17:24] old in the last few weeks I guess it was
[17:28] they had had a a meeting brother
[17:30] shrewbury felt led to have a 3 weeks of
[17:33] meeting and just one of his lay
[17:35] ministers that assists him I understand
[17:38] was speaking the meeting and I don't
[17:40] know what all happened but the brother
[17:42] was prayed for and uh his name is Tony
[17:47] and he was prayed for and he lives about
[17:50] 15 miles from the church and after the
[17:52] service he and his wife and either his
[17:55] mother or his wife's mother they were in
[17:58] the car car and he's driving and he said
[18:02] I can see out of that
[18:04] eye and he said you know what I'm going
[18:06] to do I'm going to stop and I'm going to
[18:09] put a patch over my over my good eye and
[18:13] they of course his wife and uh
[18:15] mother-in-law got real nervous you're
[18:17] going to drive you know with that eye
[18:21] and he put a patch on his good eye and
[18:23] drove 15 miles home I say praise be to
[18:27] God hallelujah
[18:32] and brother Shrewsbury said he had him
[18:34] just in the meeting the other day stand
[18:36] up he says stand up brother Tony brother
[18:39] Tony stood up in the meeting he said I
[18:40] want you to cover your good eye which he
[18:43] did and he said now I want you to count
[18:45] my fingers how many fingers do I have up
[18:47] how many fingers do I have up he said he
[18:49] could see just fine I say praise be to
[18:52] God hallelujah that's a great
[18:55] encouragement to the church our God is a
[18:57] god of Supernatural
[18:59] things and if we can just believe only
[19:02] believe
[19:04] Hallelujah he does know our name doesn't

[23:32] Babylon sent letters and a present to
[23:36] Hezekiah for he had heard that Hezekiah
[23:39] had been
[23:40] sick and Hezekiah hearkened to them and
[23:44] showed them all the house of his
[23:47] precious things and the silver and the
[23:50] gold and the spices and the precious
[23:52] ointment and all the house of his armor
[23:56] and all that was found in his his
[23:59] treasures there was nothing in his house
[24:02] nor in all his do Dominion that Hezekiah
[24:06] showed them not then came Isaiah the
[24:10] prophet unto King Hezekiah and that is
[24:13] Isaiah of the book of Isaiah and said
[24:16] unto him what said these men and from
[24:21] whence came they unto thee and Hezekiah
[24:24] said they are come from a far country
[24:27] even from
[24:29] Babylon and he said what have they seen
[24:32] in thine
[24:33] house what have they seen in thine house
[24:36] and Hezekiah answered all the things
[24:39] that are in mine house have they seen
[24:42] there is nothing among my treasures that
[24:44] I have not showed them and Isaiah said
[24:47] unto Hezekiah hear the word of the
[24:50] Lord behold the days come that all that
[24:54] is in thine house and that which thy
[24:57] fathers have laid up in store unto this
[25:00] day shall be carried into Babylon
[25:04] nothing shall be left saith the Lord and
[25:08] of thy sons that shall issue from thee
[25:11] which Thou shalt beget shall they take
[25:15] away and they shall be unic in the
[25:18] Palace of the king of Babylon then said
[25:22] Hezekiah unto Isaiah good is the word of
[25:24] the Lord which thou Hast spoken and he
[25:28] said said is it not good if peace and
[25:32] Truth be in my days may God bless his
[25:36] word as you have your
[25:39] seats I'll really need you will need
[25:43] your full
[25:45] attention as the Lord I ask I ask the
[25:49] Lord
[25:50] to take and assist me very very much in
[25:53] this service I spoke last week on being
[25:57] impress impressed by Revelation and how
[26:00] we are impressed by different things and
[26:04] when we are
[26:06] impressed it it uh causes a an action or
[26:09] a reaction within
[26:11] us uh we're all impressed with
[26:16] something or
[26:18] someone and sometime we may become
[26:21] impressed uh very suddenly something we
[26:25] just see
[26:27] momentarily we become impressed with it
[26:30] and other times other things impress us
[26:35] over a long period of time but what we
[26:38] are impressed with impressed means to be
[26:42] left with a mark from a constant
[26:45] pressure that's put upon either the mind
[26:49] or the conscience or our our life some
[26:51] aspect of us and it can take place over
[26:55] a long period of time and then then we
[26:58] can also be impressed now impression
[27:02] Naturally Speaking happens when our
[27:05] senses are contacted something we see
[27:09] something we hear and I just mentioned
[27:12] very briefly and I want to be very brief
[27:14] in the summary you know people are
[27:16] impressed with art they're impressed
[27:18] with architecture they're impressed with
[27:21] great things or big things or they're
[27:23] impressed with music or musicians and
[27:26] and we can just any Myriad of things
[27:30] that people become impressed but if you
[27:32] are really
[27:33] impressed by something or by someone or
[27:36] by some character or something that you
[27:40] observe and I'm speaking about really
[27:43] being impressed that impression will
[27:46] leave an imprint on you and if if it's
[27:50] on a over a period of time it will
[27:53] actually shape your life until you
[27:56] become what you are impressed by now
[28:00] that is the that is the principle that
[28:02] is spoken of uh that I spoke of last
[28:06] Sunday but the when it comes to a
[28:09] spiritual impression and we went into
[28:11] what the prophet of God spoke about our
[28:14] conscious and our subconscious and it
[28:17] become very very evident that uh a
[28:21] Believer and then we need let me just
[28:24] preface that by saying and we need
[28:26] conditions for Revelation there has to
[28:29] be conditions the right atmosphere the
[28:33] right environment has to be present and
[28:36] when that when that does take place and
[28:40] the right environment the right
[28:42] conditions and you yield and submit
[28:44] yourself and uh Focus yourself and just
[28:49] in a relaxed State begin to receive the
[28:53] engrafted word of God that even bypasses
[28:58] our mental our conscious our conscious
[29:02] our mental our critical conscious and
[29:05] comes down into the soul then the Holy
[29:08] Spirit can bring back to remembrance the
[29:11] things that you heard at the appointed
[29:12] time and it begins to change and shape
[29:16] maybe it just be a thought you'll run
[29:17] into something next week and then
[29:20] something you heard and and you don't
[29:22] really realize it at the moment it's not
[29:25] in your conscious thought but it's
[29:27] something within you
[29:28] and it affects you it moves you it
[29:31] begins to direct your actions and
[29:34] actually you're being shaped by that
[29:37] which you receive from God through the
[29:39] word of God by the Holy Spirit you can
[29:42] say Amen to
[29:43] that coming through that
[29:46] subconscious last Sunday I made
[29:48] reference to the scripture and our
[29:50] scripture reading had to do with what
[29:53] the Apostle John had said concerning
[29:56] their time when they were following
[29:58] Christ and he said that which was from
[30:01] the beginning the things that we've
[30:03] heard and the things that we've seen the
[30:06] things that we looked upon and our hands
[30:09] of handled of the word of Life uh for
[30:12] the life was manifested and we seen it
[30:15] and we bear witness and we show it unto
[30:17] you and we declare it and and even after
[30:21] all of that we know that it was not what
[30:25] they heard and what they saw and what
[30:27] they had hands handled that actually
[30:30] revealed who Jesus Christ was to them
[30:33] because the scripture says flesh and
[30:35] blood and that's your flesh and blood
[30:38] and any preacher's flesh and blood and
[30:40] any parents flesh and blood or anyone
[30:43] else cannot reveal fully who Jesus
[30:47] Christ is now you can sit and hear the
[30:49] word as they heard it they heard it they
[30:52] pondered it but the Bible also tells us
[30:55] that that as they continued to follow on
[30:58] and then certain events took place then
[31:01] remembered they the word of the Lord so
[31:04] it was spoken they heard it but that did
[31:07] not do the revealing at the moment but
[31:09] as they had received it into a believing
[31:12] heart in Simplicity they received it and
[31:16] then they ran into something later on
[31:18] then they remembered what the Lord had
[31:20] spoken because now they were seeing it
[31:23] unfold unfold itself so there must be
[31:26] this added spiritual Dimension to even
[31:30] the things you hear this morning and
[31:32] that's why we pray God by the Holy
[31:36] Spirit cause these things to be a
[31:38] reality to me if if I don't need them
[31:41] now cause them to be a reality to me
[31:44] when I do need them may they be and may
[31:46] I be in a place may I be ready may I be
[31:49] available may I be yielded bring me in
[31:52] that place I think that it's absolutely
[31:54] critical that we keep that H at
[31:59] itude we may not be fully
[32:03] aware of the magnitude of what we are
[32:06] receiving until a later
[32:09] time I want you to think about that even
[32:12] what you're hearing now may say well
[32:14] that was rather simple and that may well
[32:19] be but we may not be aware of the
[32:23] magnitude of what we're hearing until a
[32:25] later time and then the holy ghost will
[32:28] bring to your attention or to your
[32:31] remembrance Jesus said John 14:26 but
[32:35] the
[32:36] comforter when which the which is the
[32:39] Holy Ghost whom the father will send in
[32:42] my name he shall teach you all things
[32:46] and bring all things it's powerful all
[32:50] things to your remembrance whatsoever I
[32:54] have said unto you so he had said it he
[32:57] spoke spoke it but now he's saying the
[33:00] father will send the comforter the Holy
[33:02] Spirit and he's going to bring all
[33:04] things back to your remembrance of the
[33:07] things which I have said so when Jesus
[33:10] spoke it they were not able to receive
[33:12] the full revelation of what was said is
[33:16] that correct however the conditions the
[33:20] conditions for the Revelation were
[33:22] present they were followers we're
[33:25] following you wherever you lead we're
[33:28] following you in the good times in The
[33:30] Bad Times we're following you those are
[33:33] the conditions we're yielding whatever
[33:35] you say we'll do you tell us to go and
[33:38] get a donkey we'll go and get a donkey
[33:40] you tell us to go and get a an upper
[33:43] chamber we'll go and get an upper
[33:44] chamber you tell us to prepare tell us
[33:47] to go into the City and and buy victuals
[33:50] for the people whatever you say we'll do
[33:52] but they weren't under they didn't know
[33:54] it's going to be written in the
[33:55] scripture they didn't know that every
[33:57] move M was the word of God that was
[34:00] going to be written for centuries to
[34:01] come they didn't know that but the Holy
[34:04] Spirit would make these things real and
[34:06] that's what I say we do not know what
[34:08] the you don't know what the magnitude of
[34:10] your being here your life your testimony
[34:13] your words the very expression of Christ
[34:16] in you you don't know what portion that
[34:18] is playing in the overall
[34:21] Rapture you have no way of knowing that
[34:24] so you have no way of measuring the
[34:27] magnitud ude of what God is bringing and
[34:29] registering in your
[34:37] heart in the message God identifying
[34:42] himself and I believe I read this last
[34:45] Sunday Jesus was referring to Luke the
[34:49] 17th chapter and that's such a common
[34:52] scripture to us I don't want you just to
[34:54] glance over
[34:56] it and he says as it was reading he's
[35:00] quoting back to Luke 17:30 as it was in
[35:03] the days of Sodom so shall it be in the
[35:06] coming of the son of man when the son of
[35:09] man is being revealed and he says then
[35:12] when the Revelation is unfolding
[35:16] itself when the
[35:19] Revelation is unfolding itself in the
[35:22] days when the world will be like Sodom
[35:26] what will it be he said the
[35:29] characteristic of that scripture the
[35:32] characteristic of that scripture Luke
[35:34] 17:30 being fulfilled which is the
[35:38] Revelation unfolding
[35:42] itself God identifying himself by his
[35:46] characteristic
[35:47] characteristics that he's always been he
[35:50] cannot leave that in the last days he
[35:54] identified through his son I well I'm
[35:58] just be laboring this a we bit I want
[36:01] you to hang on to every word in the last
[36:04] days he said in the last days he
[36:08] identified through his son now the
[36:11] Revelation is unfolding itself you
[36:14] cannot make the revelation of God's word
[36:17] unfold itself it is a living seed and so
[36:21] it unfolds itself oh but there's another
[36:25] important aspect here go God just
[36:28] doesn't have his word unfolding itself
[36:31] and revealing marvelous things I have a
[36:34] question to
[36:36] whom to whom who is this for on whose
[36:40] behalf is this and what is the objective
[36:43] of God in doing this oh well I'll go to
[36:47] Galatians
[36:48] 3 uh 3:18 and 19 and now I'm just I'm
[36:53] just actually giving a little uh
[36:55] foundation for the service we've got a
[36:58] lot of hay on our
[37:02] Fork Apostle Paul says for if the
[37:07] inheritance be of the law if our
[37:10] inheritance and he's speaking to the
[37:12] Galatians if your inheritance your
[37:15] inheritance your spiritual inheritance
[37:17] he said if it be of the law Thou shalt
[37:20] Thou shalt not Thou shalt Thou shalt not
[37:24] he said then it is no more of promise
[37:27] if it's of the law and you do this and
[37:30] you don't do that and you do a whole lot
[37:31] of things if it's of the law if your
[37:33] inheritance is coming by the law then
[37:36] it's not by
[37:38] promise but he says but God gave it to
[37:40] Abraham by promise it was
[37:44] unconditional brother Brandon makes a
[37:46] point many times he says to Adam if you
[37:49] do this and I'll do this but but when it
[37:52] came to Abraham that is not what he said
[37:55] he said to Abraham I have done it
[37:58] it's already
[38:00] done you are going to be a father of
[38:02] Nations you are going to have a son the
[38:05] sun's coming by promise not by what you
[38:08] can achieve I'm giving you the
[38:12] sun isn't it wonderful to have an
[38:14] unconditional
[38:17] promise but God gave it to Abraham by
[38:20] promise wherefore then serveth the law
[38:24] he asked the question then what does the
[38:26] law serve it was added because of
[38:30] transgressions if there's no sign out
[38:32] there that says you know 30 m an hour
[38:35] you can go 50 but if it says 30 m an
[38:38] hour the law is added so that
[38:40] transgression can be identified then you
[38:43] go 50 you're
[38:45] guilty so that is just that simple it
[38:48] was added because of transgressions
[38:51] because uh people I won't want to get
[38:54] into it but people were simply
[38:55] transgressing they were even
[38:56] transgressing their own conscience and
[38:59] so God gave a law that would make the
[39:02] whole world guilty before him but he
[39:04] says now notice this wherefore then
[39:07] serveth the law it was added because of
[39:11] transgressions and here's the phrase
[39:13] till the seed should come to whom the
[39:18] promise was
[39:19] made the law was given the law was given
[39:25] so that transgression could be
[39:26] multiplied
[39:29] until the seed would come the people
[39:33] would come the elected would come to
[39:37] whom the promise had been made because
[39:41] until the promise the promise could be
[39:43] declared but if the people weren't there
[39:46] to whom the promise was given then uh
[39:50] then it's it's not a complete picture
[39:53] okay we we we'll just talk about a
[39:54] natural inheritance here uh a father and
[39:57] a mother than uh a young man young woman
[40:00] get married and they're they working
[40:03] hard and the children come into the
[40:05] family and they got little Junior in a
[40:07] crib and maybe another one crawling
[40:09] around and and so on and daddy he's
[40:12] working every day and bringing back and
[40:14] you know the feeding them and clothing
[40:17] them and all the rest of it and maybe
[40:19] putting a little savings away or gets a
[40:21] little house or whatever more who who
[40:23] who is that inheritance well it belongs
[40:26] those little ones crawling around but
[40:27] they don't know
[40:29] it and before they came on the scene
[40:32] Maybe daddy was already building a place
[40:35] but he was building it for for the
[40:37] children but they haven't even come yet
[40:40] you understand so the inheritance is
[40:43] their but they're not even on the scene
[40:45] yet but The Inheritance is for them and
[40:48] then when they come on the scene they
[40:49] are The Heirs of what Mother and Dad
[40:52] have it's just that simple and so God
[40:55] had great things in store for his
[40:57] children and he has and he has seed
[41:00] coming thanks be to God all down from
[41:03] generation to generation from season to
[41:06] season he has children coming and he's
[41:08] got promises time locked in this word of
[41:11] God that's for All Peoples of all time
[41:15] and there were promises for this day for
[41:18] this day and Luke 17:30 was one of those
[41:22] promises that was time locked for this
[41:25] day in the day when the son of man is
[41:28] revealed what day this day and that sat
[41:31] here for centuries but the children to
[41:34] whom the promise was made had not
[41:38] arrived and so it was it was absolutely
[41:41] essential that when the children arrived
[41:45] then the Holy Spirit begins to shine
[41:48] what he did through a prophet messenger
[41:51] shined upon that scripture and kept
[41:54] referring to it and referring to it and
[41:56] referring ref in to it and tens of
[41:58] thousands hundreds of thousands heard it
[42:01] but there were an elect group to whom
[42:04] the promise was
[42:06] made and they saw it and they couldn't
[42:09] see anything else they couldn't help
[42:12] themselves they saw it and it was it
[42:14] came by Revelation I can say all of
[42:17] those that have seen the revelation of
[42:20] Luke 17:30 the revealing of the son of
[42:22] man how did it come to you you didn't go
[42:25] to a school you didn't go to cat ISM you
[42:28] maybe heard a lot of sermons but you
[42:29] know that just comes like that you see
[42:33] it no one can shake that from you I tell
[42:37] you there isn't enough devils in Hell
[42:40] there isn't enough theological teachers
[42:42] there isn't enough books in the world to
[42:44] take that out of my
[42:50] heart what did we know what did you know
[42:54] about the scriptures what did you know
[42:56] about the rapture your process what did
[42:58] you know about the shout the voice in
[43:00] the trumpet before you heard the message
[43:03] big fat zero big fat zero until the
[43:06] message came what was it it was the
[43:09] promise was always there the Apostle
[43:12] Paul spoke it it show I show you a great
[43:15] mystery we do not all sleep but we'll
[43:18] all be changed Hallelujah we didn't know
[43:21] how we didn't have the word a sweep will
[43:24] go over us we had never heard will'll
[43:26] change in our atoms we had never heard
[43:29] in fact as we had the whole thing
[43:31] happening in the twinkling of an eye
[43:33] that's how twisted even intelligent men
[43:35] can become because there's nothing in
[43:37] the scripture says it'll happen in the
[43:38] twinkling of an eye it says we'll be
[43:40] changed in the twinkling of an eye but
[43:43] people put it and put the whole Rapture
[43:45] process then it comes a prophet starts
[43:47] putting it in order there'll be a voice
[43:49] there'll be a shout and the shout will
[43:51] be a message and that is to collect the
[43:53] living there'll be a voice and the voice
[43:56] is to collect the sleeping and there'll
[43:58] be a trumpet and that will be the
[43:59] sleeping and the living gathering
[44:02] together for we always gather at a
[44:04] trumpet when did you know
[44:07] that when did we know that well you know
[44:11] it now you know it now I'm asking do you
[44:14] know it now now my next question how did
[44:17] it come to
[44:18] you how did it come what channel did it
[44:21] come I'm not too sure that's the channel
[44:24] I'm talking about it's a channel that
[44:26] God created it comes down into the soul
[44:29] we don't know how it comes all we can
[44:31] say it it arrived Hallelujah it arrived
[44:35] it is so
[44:37] real
[44:40] amen what do you know about Revelation
[44:42] 10 before the message come did you ever
[44:45] have the emphasis on a I saw another
[44:47] Mighty angel coming down descending from
[44:51] heaven and then and and it's described
[44:54] the rainbows over his head and it's and
[44:57] his hair is white and his feet and then
[45:00] you you look into and then you just have
[45:02] you have a simple Simplicity of a
[45:04] prophet message say it's the same one in
[45:06] Revelation one he described exactly the
[45:09] same he's the same one and we looked at
[45:13] it we said of
[45:15] course what was that how did that come
[45:18] to
[45:21] us until the seed should come to whom
[45:25] the promise was made re reation was
[45:27] actually made for the children who
[45:30] should come until the seed should come
[45:33] to whom the promise was made Revelation
[45:35] 10:7 was made for us Revelation 101 was
[45:40] made for us it was spoken for
[45:44] us Thessalonians through the Apostle
[45:47] Paul was spoken for us you can set
[45:50] yourself off if you wish put yourself
[45:52] off in some Far Away place if you wish I
[45:56] put myself directly by God's grace under
[45:59] those promises this is to whom I'm part
[46:02] of that seed to whom This Promise was
[46:06] made and I say thanks be to God we've
[46:09] arrived Hallelujah and the Holy Spirit
[46:12] was on time and the Holy Spirit took
[46:14] those promises and said and gave them to
[46:17] the children say here they are
[46:19] children here they are how did we know
[46:22] the coming of the Lord was a process
[46:25] until the message came
[46:27] there's so much confusion out there
[46:29] talking about the coming of the Lord
[46:31] have no idea how it's going to happen
[46:33] here comes a prophet ler right
[46:35] out here's step one here's step two
[46:38] here's how it's going to happen here's
[46:40] the whole scene here's the message
[46:42] here's the word of God going back to the
[46:44] Jews it's so beautiful isn't
[46:50] it and
[46:52] because because you are Sons
[46:57] Apostle Paul says now he's revealing
[47:00] himself and because your
[47:03] sons God has sent forth the spirit of
[47:07] his son not into your head or into your
[47:12] mind but into your heart he sent forth
[47:16] the spirit of his son into your hearts
[47:19] crying Abba
[47:22] Father father we enter into a
[47:25] relationship with him
[47:27] and the prophet said he loved fatherhood
[47:31] I have a few uh slides I'm just going to
[47:33] show the first couple here and because
[47:36] you are
[47:47] sons all right
[48:10] all right there we
[48:12] are and because you're
[48:16] Sons God ha sent forth the spirit of his
[48:19] son into your hearts crying Abba Father
[48:28] brother brandham said he loved
[48:30] fatherhood for he was a father and the
[48:34] only way I want to stress that the only
[48:38] way that he could express it was to
[48:40] become a son of man and that's the
[48:43] reason Jesus kept saying the son of man
[48:47] now I want to get your attention here
[48:49] when Jesus stood here on Earth who was
[48:52] the son of man and God
[48:57] who fills all time and
[48:59] space Desiring because he said also in
[49:02] Christ The Mystery of God revealed that
[49:04] his great uh his great three-fold
[49:08] mystery was he wanted to reveal himself
[49:12] to the people now if you just try in
[49:14] your imagination for a moment
[49:17] is imagine this God the god that gave
[49:23] all life the god that created all the
[49:25] universe that's God
[49:27] and he wants to have a family he wants
[49:29] to enter into a relationship that he
[49:33] can't have with stars and planets and
[49:36] all of these things and and even an
[49:38] animal kingdom but he wants one like
[49:41] himself he wants to make himself known
[49:44] his great ambition then I make myself
[49:47] known in fact is if you go back to the
[49:50] Garden of Eden this is the very thing
[49:51] that Satan Satan got in the in the
[49:54] middle and and uh did everything he
[49:57] could to disturb that process of God
[50:01] making himself known and separated the
[50:04] people from him by Disobedience by sin
[50:09] and consequently by death which Jesus
[50:12] Christ had to undo that whole act am I
[50:15] making sense to
[50:17] you and so this God he wants to reveal
[50:20] himself so now comes the very uh the the
[50:26] very person ification of God God In the
[50:29] Flesh of Jesus Christ and he begins to
[50:34] manifest himself who he is and that he's
[50:38] got attributes of healing he has
[50:41] attributes of forgiveness he has
[50:43] attributes and he's making those known
[50:46] to the people God but the what what he
[50:49] was really doing above all of that Jesus
[50:54] goes down into the waters is baptized
[50:56] and a voice speaks goes up onto the
[50:59] mount Transfiguration and a voice speaks
[51:02] what it say this is my son you can see
[51:08] what's in the heart of God he didn't say
[51:11] this is a beautiful day this is a great
[51:13] moment in time you're a wonderful people
[51:17] this is a great nation of Israel he
[51:20] could have said a lot of things but of
[51:22] all the things that was in the bosom of
[51:25] God when he had his son plus he could
[51:28] say this is my
[51:33] son this is my son and as that son and
[51:37] he loved fatherhood so much that he
[51:40] wanted to have a son who would be in His
[51:46] image and also he knows that he's
[51:48] through that son he's restoring back all
[51:51] the other Sons to himself and so Jesus
[51:55] Christ as the son of man says to the
[51:57] people when you see the days of Noah
[52:00] return on a global scale and when you
[52:03] see the days of Sodom return on a global
[52:06] scale even so even thus shall it be in
[52:09] that day the son of man will be revealed
[52:15] now listen let me say to
[52:17] you it is obvious the only reason that
[52:21] Jesus would be saying that and the only
[52:24] reason that there would be a
[52:27] further Revelation or
[52:30] uncovering of the son of man would be
[52:34] because God the Father his father wants
[52:38] to wants to uh uh manifest or show
[52:43] something of the father son relationship
[52:47] that was not that did not happen at that
[52:50] time there will be a further revealing
[52:52] of the father son relationship and that
[52:56] further revealing is that
[52:59] now now oh my I just hope you can grasp
[53:03] it with me now it's not just a singular
[53:07] Jesus Christ but now it is a body of
[53:12] people that now what they have now which
[53:15] they didn't have then when Jesus was
[53:18] here he was here single singular in an
[53:22] individual body but in Luke
[53:25] 1730 in the fatherhood who love
[53:28] fatherhood part of that loving was there
[53:31] has to be
[53:34] more there has to be more than the
[53:37] individual Jesus Christ standing here on
[53:40] Earth there's got to be some more seed
[53:43] to whom the promise I give the promise
[53:46] of Luke 17:30 but the seed must come and
[53:49] they will be part of the
[53:54] family you know if Jesus stood right
[53:56] here on
[53:59] Earth in an individual unit of body and
[54:02] flesh he would be
[54:04] incomplete he was incomplete then and I
[54:08] hope you understand that he was
[54:09] incomplete in that there were others
[54:11] that were to come and that is why he
[54:14] said it's expedient for you that I go if
[54:17] I don't go the Holy Spirit can't come
[54:21] but when he's come he'll reveal the
[54:23] truth to you he'll speak of me can you
[54:26] say Amen you understand what I'm saying
[54:29] he'll speak of me and we are will'll be
[54:32] Sons and Daughters born of the spirit
[54:36] and born of the word and in that day
[54:39] when Luke 17:30 is revealed the even the
[54:42] father and this and the sunship will
[54:45] take on a whole new dimension because
[54:47] now we'll see really what that body of
[54:50] Christ
[54:54] is my
[54:57] time slipping away on us
[55:01] terribly
[55:03] now you can just turn the lights back on
[55:05] if you will please for a
[55:11] moment I've stated in the New Testament
[55:14] pretty
[55:17] well but there is
[55:19] a there is those that
[55:23] were had revelation Revelation is not
[55:27] exclusive to the New Testament
[55:30] Revelation was also in the Old Testament
[55:33] Abel it was revealed to him brother
[55:35] brandham says to bring a lamb in the
[55:38] message works as Faith expressed brother
[55:41] brandham speaks about Abraham and he
[55:43] said it was revealed to him he said he
[55:47] considered not his own body dead neither
[55:50] even considered it he said it wasn't
[55:52] even brought into a question whether
[55:55] whether God would do it or not God said
[55:57] it he would do it and he said it was
[56:00] revealed to him how did it come just
[56:03] like I asked you how did it come to you
[56:05] the scripture the promise that was being
[56:07] made to him in the case of Moses he said
[56:12] he had his foot on the
[56:15] throne and Moses chose rather to suffer
[56:19] with the people of God than to sit on
[56:22] the throne down there because it was
[56:25] revealed to him spiritually and here he
[56:29] was going and God was proving proving
[56:33] his word to him so it was revealed to
[56:35] Abel it was revealed to Abraham it was
[56:37] revealed to Moses and brother Brandon
[56:40] speaks about David and that's the last
[56:41] one I'll refer to he said he's standing
[56:44] there with a little piece of leather
[56:46] goat skin or sheep skin with two pieces
[56:50] of string tied to it but it was revealed
[56:53] to him by Revelation revelation and
[56:56] struck him and he said the god that took
[56:59] me out of the paws of the bear and the
[57:02] god that took me out of the paws of the
[57:04] lion how much more will he deliver that
[57:08] un uncircumcised Philistine into my hand
[57:12] whatever that Philistine is
[57:15] today it can be a cancer it can be some
[57:19] disease it can be some thing that has
[57:22] plagued you spiritually it can be some
[57:25] spirit that has hounded you and bound
[57:27] you you got to rise up either today
[57:31] tomorrow or sometime if you believe that
[57:34] you're a son or a daughter to whom the
[57:37] promise is made I said it's time that
[57:39] you arise and say all I got is a sling
[57:43] but I got a promise from God and this
[57:45] thing cannot stay
[57:53] here sometimes blessings
[57:56] and
[57:58] benefits continue
[58:00] on because God has been pleased with the
[58:03] life of
[58:06] another why do you think about that I
[58:08] read it several times in my
[58:12] studies sometimes God would even allow
[58:15] the entire
[58:17] Kingdom or we could say the entire
[58:20] church or we could say an entire
[58:23] family you here as young people you
[58:25] might say my oh we got a blessed
[58:31] family we
[58:34] just all I all I could really say is
[58:37] thank you Lord I Thank you but you may
[58:40] not know why that blessing is
[58:43] there I feel that we've been a blessed
[58:46] church and I cannot perhaps identify
[58:49] exactly why but I do know that God has
[58:53] blessed the assembly here and he's
[58:56] blessed individuals here he's blessed
[58:58] families here and and and you have
[59:02] allowed me to be part of the rejoicing
[59:05] with you and I
[59:07] Rejoice Hallelujah over the mighty
[59:10] things that God has done whereof we are
[59:14] glad and I hope we never lose that
[59:18] Thanksgiving Hallelujah and if we're not
[59:21] here because of that blessing of God and
[59:23] we ought to go somewhere else we're here
[59:26] because we believe that God has us here
[59:29] that you have a special place a special
[59:32] recognition and God has sent his
[59:35] promise to the elected seed until they
[59:39] should come and if you can't say
[59:41] anything else before you leave this
[59:42] place I want you to be able to say I am
[59:46] one I am one of the seed to whom the
[59:50] promise was made and thus I am here
[59:55] receiving the the benefits of that
[1:00:04] promise I want
[1:00:06] to hope that you can stay with me now I
[1:00:09] want to step back
[1:00:11] quickly to a
[1:00:13] King King Hezekiah and I'm going to move
[1:00:17] as quickly as I
[1:00:20] can now in the days of Solomon King
[1:00:24] Solomon he had a very
[1:00:27] competent a very very competent very
[1:00:31] industrious and a man of great Valor in
[1:00:35] his kingdom and his name was
[1:00:39] jobon he was he was the son of of one of
[1:00:43] his leading servants and he made him
[1:00:47] because he saw the kind of man that he
[1:00:49] was he was a young man the Bible calls
[1:00:51] him a young man and Solomon detected and
[1:00:55] saw what kind of a man he was and he put
[1:00:57] Jobo over his entire house over all all
[1:01:02] of his house and the Bible says that the
[1:01:05] man
[1:01:06] Jobo was a mighty man of Valor and
[1:01:09] Solomon seeing the young man that he was
[1:01:12] industrious he made him ruler over all
[1:01:15] the charge of the House of
[1:01:19] Joseph and
[1:01:21] then Solomon's son was rabone so if you
[1:01:26] remember those rabom was Solomon's son
[1:01:31] and
[1:01:31] Jobo was a man that he had appointed a
[1:01:34] young man Jesus spoke of Solomon in all
[1:01:38] of his glory and the glory of his
[1:01:42] kingdom and we can only
[1:01:45] imagine the portion of
[1:01:48] trust that Solomon must have had in
[1:01:51] order to give all of this into
[1:01:53] jeroboam's hands so now we have some
[1:01:57] events that are happening and they're
[1:01:59] happening towards the end of Solomon's
[1:02:02] Ministry or Solomon's Reign Solomon
[1:02:07] now towards the end of his life because
[1:02:11] he had many wives and he also took wives
[1:02:15] of heathen Nations no doubt beautiful
[1:02:18] young women but he had hundreds of wives
[1:02:22] and the Bible says that the wives
[1:02:26] persuaded the heart of Solomon away from
[1:02:30] the Lord and to their
[1:02:33] idolatry and
[1:02:35] Idols the Bible says that King Solomon
[1:02:38] lived loved many strange
[1:02:41] women together with the daughter of
[1:02:44] pharaoh women of the moabites and the
[1:02:47] ammonites the the zidian and
[1:02:52] and the Hittites and if you knew
[1:02:53] anything about the Hittites the Hittites
[1:02:55] were really a very very violent vicious
[1:02:58] Wicked
[1:03:00] people and of the Nations concerning
[1:03:02] which the Lord said unto the children of
[1:03:05] Israel you shall not go into them and
[1:03:09] neither shall they come in unto you
[1:03:12] that's simple isn't it you shall not go
[1:03:14] into them and you shall not you know I
[1:03:17] think of some of the things that God has
[1:03:18] spoken to us by by uh the prophet of God
[1:03:21] in this generation and it is so simple
[1:03:24] it's just that simple
[1:03:26] you don't do that and you don't go out
[1:03:29] there because if you do you'll be
[1:03:31] afflicted and you'll bring that world
[1:03:34] back in or you'll be afflicted yourself
[1:03:37] or whatever more they're just such
[1:03:39] simple things you should dress in a
[1:03:41] certain Manner and act in a certain
[1:03:43] Manner and live in a certain way it's
[1:03:46] not complicated it's not rocket
[1:03:49] science say Amen you know it's
[1:03:53] true just do it
[1:03:59] and so the Bible says
[1:04:01] that you shall not go to them they shall
[1:04:04] not come in unto you for surely
[1:04:07] surely they will turn away your heart
[1:04:10] from their your heart after their gods
[1:04:14] and Solomon clave unto these in love the
[1:04:18] last verse for it came to pass when
[1:04:22] Solomon was
[1:04:23] old excuse me
[1:04:26] terrible to get
[1:04:32] old when Solomon was old that his wives
[1:04:37] glad I just got
[1:04:42] one turned him
[1:04:46] away turn him away turn his heart away
[1:04:50] after other gods and his heart was not
[1:04:53] perfect with the Lord his God
[1:04:56] as was the heart of David his father and
[1:05:00] because of this because of this and
[1:05:04] because of this situation had Arisen at
[1:05:07] the end of his life I'm giving you
[1:05:08] background now to King Hezekiah because
[1:05:11] of
[1:05:12] this
[1:05:14] Jobo had a new garment on and he walked
[1:05:18] out into a
[1:05:19] field and was met there with the prophet
[1:05:22] of God
[1:05:24] AA and AKA was speaking to him and AKA
[1:05:29] took His Garment and rent it into 12
[1:05:34] pieces and he gave Jobo 10 now that's
[1:05:38] not Solomon's son that's a young man of
[1:05:42] Valor and he gave him 10 pieces and said
[1:05:45] to
[1:05:46] him and he said to Jobo take these 10
[1:05:49] pieces for thus sayth the Lord the god
[1:05:53] of Israel behold I will Ren the kingdom
[1:05:56] out of the hand of Solomon and will give
[1:05:59] 10 tribes to thee but he shall have one
[1:06:03] tribe there's one missing he shall have
[1:06:06] one tribe that tribe was
[1:06:08] Judah for my servant David's sake and
[1:06:12] for Jerusalem's sake the city which I
[1:06:15] have chosen out of all the tribes of
[1:06:18] Israel so here you're going to have
[1:06:21] 10 and and I'll leave one with David's
[1:06:25] son
[1:06:27] Solomon to reabo and he'll have one
[1:06:30] he'll have Jerusalem he'll have
[1:06:33] Judah and when Solomon died and riab his
[1:06:37] son became the king he was really very
[1:06:41] very foolish and very
[1:06:43] unwise because they he he he came with a
[1:06:47] Messengers and they approached riab and
[1:06:50] said your father was very harsh and put
[1:06:53] very strict uh uh
[1:06:56] heavy burdens on us and we ask you to
[1:06:59] lighten these burdens and the Bible
[1:07:02] tells us that uh rabom he took counsel
[1:07:05] from his young friends and his peers and
[1:07:08] they said put heavier burdens on them
[1:07:10] and so he went back and told him say my
[1:07:13] little finger is going to be as thick
[1:07:14] like my father's thigh or something like
[1:07:17] that and I'm going to put heavier
[1:07:19] burdens and so they they rebelled
[1:07:22] against uh they rebelled against re B
[1:07:26] and thus the prophet AA his prophecy was
[1:07:30] fulfilled and the nation was torn in two
[1:07:33] and the tribes of 10 tribes took Jobo as
[1:07:37] their King and they became the northern
[1:07:39] kingdom and rabom was left with one
[1:07:43] which was just Judah and it came to pass
[1:07:47] when Israel heard that jobon was come
[1:07:50] again that they sent and called him
[1:07:52] under the congregation and made him King
[1:07:54] over all is Israel and here's now where
[1:07:56] you want to keep your
[1:07:59] attention because I may have to come
[1:08:01] back to this but when we speak of Israel
[1:08:04] now in this service today we're not
[1:08:06] speaking of the nation of Israel we're
[1:08:08] speaking of the 10 tribes those 10
[1:08:11] tribes were called Israel and the other
[1:08:15] tribe was called Judah and now now the
[1:08:20] lineage of the Kings of Israel split
[1:08:23] into two
[1:08:25] and there's two lists of kings that go
[1:08:27] on down and one are one is the Kings of
[1:08:31] Israel and the other is the kings of
[1:08:34] Judah now I needed to say
[1:08:37] that
[1:08:39] because Jobo was a very very smart
[1:08:43] cunning
[1:08:44] man not evil in that sense of the word
[1:08:48] because otherwise Solomon wouldn't have
[1:08:49] given him the responsibility that he
[1:08:51] gave
[1:08:51] him but right away Jobo says are you
[1:08:57] with me Jobo says in his mind
[1:09:01] ah if I let the people go to Jerusalem
[1:09:05] to worship if I let them go to Jerusalem
[1:09:09] for the
[1:09:11] Passover their hearts are liable to be
[1:09:13] swung into the allegiance of
[1:09:16] riabal and be swung back under rabom as
[1:09:20] king and I mustn't do that or I will
[1:09:23] lose their allegiance so what shall I do
[1:09:27] so he set up two golden calves he set up
[1:09:32] one at the North and he set up one at
[1:09:36] the south in bethl which was Mount
[1:09:40] Ephraim and one in the north which is
[1:09:44] Dan and so he could announce to the
[1:09:47] people aren't you
[1:09:49] lucky you have jerob as king you don't
[1:09:53] have to journey to Jerusalem anymore
[1:09:55] more I've localized the thing and you
[1:09:58] that are in the South you can worship in
[1:10:01] Ephraim and bethl and we got a golden
[1:10:04] calf down there and you lucky people who
[1:10:06] live in the North up and down you have a
[1:10:09] calf up there and you can worship
[1:10:13] there that became known as the sins of
[1:10:21] Jobo and it never left the children of
[1:10:26] Israel and the scripture says concerning
[1:10:30] the sins of
[1:10:31] Jobo because now it looked like a good
[1:10:34] idea it was a good political move but he
[1:10:38] got the people into
[1:10:41] idolatry and the Bible says if this
[1:10:44] people go up to do sacrifice to the
[1:10:46] house of the Lord at Jerusalem then
[1:10:48] shall the heart of this people turn
[1:10:51] again to their
[1:10:52] lord even unto rabam king of Judah and
[1:10:56] they shall kill me and go again to rabom
[1:10:59] King of Judah so he took counsel and
[1:11:02] they made the two Cals and said to them
[1:11:04] it's too much for you to go to Jerusalem
[1:11:07] Behold thy Gods oh Israel now you know
[1:11:11] one of the challenges of a minister is
[1:11:13] when he's going from the Old Testament
[1:11:15] and you're sitting here saying how does
[1:11:17] that relate to us I can tell you that
[1:11:20] that same spirit is still very present
[1:11:23] and even more so today
[1:11:25] in and and trying to suggest to the
[1:11:28] people it's too
[1:11:30] much the message really requires too
[1:11:33] much for you you can have the same
[1:11:36] benefits you can have the same blessings
[1:11:39] you don't have to go to that extreme
[1:11:42] don't go down you don't have to go down
[1:11:44] to Jerusalem you don't have to do all of
[1:11:46] these things that that oh and then they
[1:11:49] began to compare themselves with
[1:11:52] themselves and say well they don't go
[1:11:54] down
[1:11:55] the the people in Dan they don't go down
[1:11:58] there what do we have to go down there
[1:12:00] for they don't dress like that what do
[1:12:02] we have to dress like that for I see
[1:12:04] what they do in another church I see
[1:12:06] what they do in another place I see what
[1:12:08] they're doing on the state side or I see
[1:12:11] what they're doing up in Edmonton or I
[1:12:12] see what they're doing that's not the
[1:12:15] Bible they're not our scripture say my
[1:12:18] friend your friend's not in the Bible as
[1:12:21] a book in the Bible it's not what
[1:12:23] somebody thinks it's not what somebody
[1:12:26] reasons it's not even what you think
[1:12:28] it's what God has
[1:12:30] [Applause]
[1:12:34] said and what do you want to do have
[1:12:37] have something easy here for just a
[1:12:39] breath and you're
[1:12:41] gone and then then eternity then what
[1:12:45] the other side then
[1:12:46] what in the presence of God then what
[1:12:50] Hallelujah and we've got this message as
[1:12:52] a incredible responsibility and and we
[1:12:55] are the seed to whom it
[1:12:57] came and Israel was God's chosen
[1:13:01] nation and now this nation that God
[1:13:04] chose as his own people it's Tor
[1:13:07] to and he's got one
[1:13:09] leader and he had a prophet say to him
[1:13:12] you're going to have 10 and he takes the
[1:13:15] 10 tribes and drags them into absolute
[1:13:18] idolatry and they're called the sins of
[1:13:22] Jobo and here's just the scripture
[1:13:28] and he shall give Israel up because of
[1:13:30] the sins of Jobo Kings
[1:13:33] 14:16 First Kings 15:30 because of the
[1:13:37] sins of Jobo which he sinned in which he
[1:13:40] made Israel to sin Kings
[1:13:44] 16:31 and it came to pass as if they had
[1:13:47] been a light thing for him to walk in
[1:13:50] the sins of
[1:13:51] Jobo 2 Kings 3:3 nevertheless he clave
[1:13:55] under the sins of
[1:13:58] jobon 2 Kings 10:31 and jahu there's
[1:14:02] much read about J was a fast driver and
[1:14:05] he took no heed to walk in the law of
[1:14:08] the Lord for he departed he he he
[1:14:11] departed not from the sins of Jobo 2
[1:14:14] Kings
[1:14:15] 13:2 and he did that which was evil in
[1:14:18] the sight of the Lord and followed the
[1:14:20] sins of Jobo 2 Kings 13:11 and he did
[1:14:24] that with which was evil in the sight of
[1:14:26] the Lord and He departed not from the
[1:14:28] sins of jerbo and and 2 Kings 14:24 and
[1:14:33] he these are all different Kings all
[1:14:35] different people all different leader
[1:14:37] and he did that which was evil in the
[1:14:39] sight of the Lord and He departed not
[1:14:41] from the sins of
[1:14:44] jerbo and second Kings 15:19 and he did
[1:14:47] that which was evil in the sight of the
[1:14:49] Lord and his fathers and and had done
[1:14:52] and departed not from the sins of jerbo
[1:14:56] we're walking all through centuries of
[1:14:58] time and this what this one man did and
[1:15:02] it goes on right right on to the end of
[1:15:04] Kings 17 and 22 for the children of
[1:15:07] Israel walked in all the sins of Jobo
[1:15:10] which he did they departed not from
[1:15:15] than brother
[1:15:17] brandham in the church
[1:15:19] ages he comes right to the
[1:15:23] end and he reads
[1:15:26] uh Deuteronomy 2916 to 20 which I won't
[1:15:29] take the time but you can write it
[1:15:33] down and God is saying to the people
[1:15:37] this is kind of a lesson are you able to
[1:15:39] follow me are you alert enough to follow
[1:15:42] me I put a lot of prayerful prayerful
[1:15:46] time into
[1:15:49] this and God said for you know how you
[1:15:52] have dealt dwelt in the land of Egypt
[1:15:56] and how we come through the Nations
[1:15:57] which you passed by and you have seen
[1:16:00] their Abominations he's talking to his
[1:16:02] people now I'm going to say to this
[1:16:04] congregation we've passed by a lot of
[1:16:11] denominations and we have come through
[1:16:14] many of these lands and we've seen how
[1:16:17] they believe and how they worship and we
[1:16:20] see what it
[1:16:23] produces and we want no part of
[1:16:26] it but if we tamper with it or if we
[1:16:30] mingle with it you will be
[1:16:37] affected am I making a
[1:16:40] point and he said lest there should come
[1:16:43] lest there should be among you man or
[1:16:46] woman or family or tribe whose heart
[1:16:52] turneth away this day from the Lord your
[1:16:54] God
[1:16:55] to go and serve other gods of these
[1:16:58] other nations lest there should be any
[1:17:01] among you a root that beareth GA and
[1:17:04] wormwood and it come to pass when he
[1:17:07] heareth the words of this curse that He
[1:17:10] blesses himself in his heart saying I
[1:17:12] will have peace I have people who have
[1:17:15] heard the message heard it declared
[1:17:17] absolutely and say well you
[1:17:22] know I talked to one right outside in
[1:17:25] the
[1:17:25] foe I said if you go this direction you
[1:17:29] might be able to keep yourself you might
[1:17:31] be able to keep
[1:17:33] yourself but you'll never keep your
[1:17:35] children your children will not follow
[1:17:38] this not go in this
[1:17:41] direction and it was a sad
[1:17:45] tale it was a sad tale that person lives
[1:17:49] in sin today gross
[1:17:51] sin and lost one of the children by
[1:17:54] Suicide
[1:17:55] died at 14 years old and the last time I
[1:17:59] told this someone didn't even like me
[1:18:01] saying it I tell you what God would have
[1:18:03] said it in the
[1:18:08] Bible because it's the
[1:18:11] truth and they don't want to hear that a
[1:18:13] man of God stood there and said but your
[1:18:16] children will
[1:18:18] not they'll not
[1:18:20] remain you might be able to hold some
[1:18:23] status cuz you're already set in your
[1:18:25] ways but they will go a different
[1:18:31] direction and some
[1:18:35] say well I don't think that's so and I
[1:18:38] had him say it to me I don't think
[1:18:39] that's
[1:18:40] so and I said to this individual be it
[1:18:44] known to you your God is not my God
[1:18:49] Amen your God is not my God I don't
[1:18:54] serve of your God your God that tells
[1:18:57] you these kind of things that tell you
[1:19:00] perverted things concerning the message
[1:19:03] that God's not my
[1:19:06] god listen friends I'm going to say some
[1:19:09] things I've proven this God and this God
[1:19:12] is a living God this God hears us this
[1:19:16] God sees us and he sees exactly where we
[1:19:19] are sees what we do he knows all about
[1:19:22] us and I'm glad he's a righteous God I'm
[1:19:26] glad he's a holy
[1:19:38] God says the Lord will not spare
[1:19:41] him but then the anger of the Lord and
[1:19:44] his jealousy shall smoke against that
[1:19:48] man and all the curses that are written
[1:19:50] in this book shall be upon him and the
[1:19:54] Lord shall blot his name and here's what
[1:19:56] brother Brandon was stressing want the
[1:19:58] congregation to hear it and the Lord
[1:19:59] shall blot his name from under the
[1:20:03] heavens and I read for you the sins of
[1:20:06] Jobo and he walked in the sins of Jobo
[1:20:09] and he walked in the Sin the sins of
[1:20:11] jobal Simply where that he turned the
[1:20:13] hearts of the people because of his own
[1:20:16] insecurity because of his own he wanted
[1:20:19] to secure his position he so he got the
[1:20:22] people and he brought them it looked
[1:20:24] like such an innocent thing he brought
[1:20:26] them and here you have 10
[1:20:28] tribes and they went into
[1:20:32] idolatry up and down and down in
[1:20:35] Ephraim I invite you to go
[1:20:39] home and read the
[1:20:42] 144,000 in the Book of
[1:20:46] Revelation and of the tribe of Asher
[1:20:48] 12,000 and of the tribe of GAD 12,000 of
[1:20:52] the tribe of nap 12,000 of the tribe of
[1:20:55] this and of the tribe of that two tribes
[1:20:58] are
[1:21:00] missing their names became blotted out
[1:21:03] Dan and Ephraim are not
[1:21:07] there the sins of
[1:21:10] Jobo carried all the way forward and
[1:21:14] those two tribes and a prophet brings it
[1:21:17] and says I'll blot his name out and
[1:21:19] their names are blotted out you know
[1:21:25] we're in a very
[1:21:27] very wonderful age may my help me we're
[1:21:31] in a very wonderful age and you have
[1:21:34] freedom of thought and freedom of
[1:21:35] worship and freedom of a whole lot of
[1:21:37] things but I'll tell you God is not some
[1:21:40] he's not some
[1:21:41] pansy God says something and that's what
[1:21:44] he
[1:21:45] means God asks us to do something and he
[1:21:48] may not force us but he asks us to do it
[1:21:51] and you'll be blessed if you do it and
[1:21:54] you will not be blessed if you don't and
[1:21:56] there are some things a person can do
[1:21:58] and come right under a curse of God and
[1:22:00] that I wouldn't want to have for
[1:22:03] anything now let me just can I take
[1:22:07] about another 10 15 minutes and then I'm
[1:22:09] I'm going to close
[1:22:11] Hezekiah King Hezekiah was the 13th King
[1:22:15] down from
[1:22:16] riabal right down to number 13 there
[1:22:20] have been all these Kings before
[1:22:22] him and his own father
[1:22:25] his name was
[1:22:27] ahaz and the Bible says that ahaz that's
[1:22:30] hezekiah's Daddy was 20 years old when
[1:22:33] he came and became
[1:22:35] king and he reigned 16 years in
[1:22:40] Jerusalem and he did that which was not
[1:22:43] right in the sight of the Lord like
[1:22:46] David his father and he made molten
[1:22:49] images and I'm giving it brief now now
[1:22:52] I've come on down to show how it all
[1:22:56] happened and now I've come down to
[1:22:59] the Hezekiah himself but I want to just
[1:23:02] give you a little bit of a picture a
[1:23:04] little window of his daddy king ahaz who
[1:23:09] was 20 and he made molten images to
[1:23:13] balum and he burnt incense in the valley
[1:23:17] of
[1:23:18] hom and he burned his children in the
[1:23:22] fire wouldn't some of you kill want to
[1:23:24] be his
[1:23:32] son after the Abominations of the
[1:23:34] Heathen whom the Lord had cast out
[1:23:36] before the children of Israel so now
[1:23:38] he's doing exactly what the other
[1:23:40] Heathen Nations that were cast out now
[1:23:44] he's doing it and he sacrificed also
[1:23:47] burnt incense in the high places and on
[1:23:50] the hills and under every Green Tree now
[1:23:53] as I go through this we have such a
[1:23:57] large contingent of young people here
[1:24:00] and you are I have a lot of Hope and
[1:24:03] confidence I'm in the Twilight time
[1:24:06] you're just in the rising of your
[1:24:07] strength and your beauty and your homes
[1:24:11] and what you'll do in
[1:24:14] life I want you to put yourself in
[1:24:17] Hezekiah place he grew up seeing all
[1:24:20] this he saw his daddy making Molten imag
[1:24:25] to
[1:24:26] bail and saw
[1:24:29] them burn some of his
[1:24:33] siblings after the Heathen
[1:24:36] gods and he's seeing them pack up
[1:24:40] incense up into the Groves in the
[1:24:42] mountains and the whole nation's doing
[1:24:45] it and he felt like an
[1:24:48] oddball because it just wasn't in his
[1:24:50] heart to do it
[1:24:55] and then he saw his daddy ahaz delivered
[1:24:59] into the hands of the king of Syria and
[1:25:02] they smot him and carried away a great
[1:25:04] multitude of the people as captives
[1:25:07] here's Hezekiah he's seeing a nation
[1:25:10] that he's a King's
[1:25:13] son I'm a message
[1:25:15] believer this just isn't supposed to
[1:25:18] happen it was happening right in Judah
[1:25:22] it's happening right in it's right right
[1:25:25] in King David's
[1:25:27] lineage this kingdom is supposed to last
[1:25:31] forever it's kingdom is supposed to be
[1:25:33] raptured oh hang on I got some things to
[1:25:37] say to you and he says and They Carried
[1:25:41] a whole lot away his captives and
[1:25:43] brought them to Damascus which is in
[1:25:45] Syria and he was also delivered into the
[1:25:47] hand of the king of Israel who smot him
[1:25:50] with a great Slaughter and the Lord
[1:25:52] brought Judah low
[1:25:55] because of ahaz king of Israel and he
[1:25:58] made Judah naked and transgressed sore
[1:26:02] against the Lord for he sacrificed unto
[1:26:05] the gods of Damascus which smot him and
[1:26:09] he said because of the Gods of the king
[1:26:11] of Syria help them can now imagine how
[1:26:14] perverted a person gets here he's taken
[1:26:16] captive he's worshiping all these
[1:26:19] Heathen gods and he comes to a place
[1:26:20] where says well they actually helped us
[1:26:28] now I know maybe you don't understand
[1:26:30] where I'm coming
[1:26:32] from but do you know that it's
[1:26:35] possible for even Believers of this
[1:26:38] message to get to such a point that they
[1:26:40] think that things that come from the
[1:26:43] mentality of the world somehow is a
[1:26:47] benefit and this is going to you know
[1:26:50] this is going to be a benefit for us
[1:26:55] and it says ahaz slept with his fathers
[1:26:58] and they buried him in the city even in
[1:27:00] Jerusalem but they brought him not into
[1:27:04] the Seer of the Kings they wouldn't even
[1:27:06] bury him in the Seer of the Kings of
[1:27:09] Israel and Hezekiah his son reigned in
[1:27:13] instead now I got something to say to
[1:27:15] this congregation and as I said it
[1:27:18] be many of you young and your young
[1:27:21] families and so on
[1:27:24] and if this brother bis's last service
[1:27:27] I'd want to punch this home to you A lot
[1:27:30] of people say well you know I'm kind of
[1:27:33] what I
[1:27:35] am my dad does
[1:27:37] this or My Mother Does
[1:27:40] that or this is kind of you know this is
[1:27:43] a kind of thing that we do in our home
[1:27:47] and yet there's something down in your
[1:27:48] subconscious that says it's not quite
[1:27:50] right
[1:27:56] and there's something down in your
[1:27:57] subconscious says I should be much more
[1:28:00] fervent but all those around me they
[1:28:03] don't take it so serious so why should I
[1:28:05] take it
[1:28:06] serious I say what's what's that got to
[1:28:09] do with
[1:28:10] it here's Hezekiah and the whole nation
[1:28:14] around him and he's a King's son and all
[1:28:17] he can see is trouble everywhere they're
[1:28:21] going in idolatry they're becoming
[1:28:23] worldly they've got the modern thought
[1:28:26] of the world it's a whole this is what
[1:28:29] this is what the world does this is what
[1:28:31] the people
[1:28:35] do this is the way they think this is
[1:28:37] the way they conduct themselves this is
[1:28:39] the way they approach
[1:28:43] things but it's not God's way and
[1:28:46] there's something down deep on the
[1:28:48] inside in the subconscious that says and
[1:28:50] you young ladies and you young men and
[1:28:53] you couples and you of this congregation
[1:28:55] know real well God registers down in the
[1:28:58] subconscious that there's something
[1:29:00] further there's something more that
[1:29:02] there's something that is wrong there's
[1:29:04] something that you need to change and
[1:29:06] I'd say that it's not it's not going to
[1:29:08] stand it just won't carry water for us
[1:29:12] to say well I see someone else or my
[1:29:14] father's this or my brother's that or my
[1:29:16] family's this or my sisters that or this
[1:29:19] has happened who cares
[1:29:26] is that going to carry any weight we
[1:29:28] stand before God and say well I live the
[1:29:30] way I live because you know everything
[1:29:33] around me the kids weren't fervent
[1:29:36] around me other families weren't really
[1:29:38] fervent around me and I I I know that
[1:29:40] there was something more but anyway
[1:29:42] that's where I
[1:29:47] lived I don't know if I'm conveying
[1:29:51] it am I really getting it across
[1:29:55] this isn't intending to be harsh but
[1:29:57] it's intending to be
[1:30:00] truthful and I wouldn't want an
[1:30:02] influence in this church or to say I'm
[1:30:05] preaching because I know this message
[1:30:08] goes elsewhere
[1:30:10] and and something happened and ah has
[1:30:12] like you know something I'm going to it
[1:30:14] might squeeze your time brother Tom but
[1:30:16] I'm going to take a little
[1:30:19] time now I have to get to
[1:30:21] it then ah house became king and I
[1:30:25] haven't got time I have all kinds of
[1:30:27] scriptures on the screen but I'm not
[1:30:28] going to take the time ahaz uh not ahaz
[1:30:32] but Hezekiah now became king and I he
[1:30:36] was 20 25 when he became king and within
[1:30:40] the first right away in the first year
[1:30:44] and the first month the Bible first year
[1:30:48] in the first month he's
[1:30:50] 25 how many here are 25 let me say you
[1:30:53] raise your
[1:30:57] hand two or three right
[1:31:01] here he's
[1:31:03] 25 you know what he does he starts to
[1:31:07] clean
[1:31:07] up he starts to clean up the house of
[1:31:11] God that this place is a mess and the
[1:31:15] people are gone in such a way so he
[1:31:18] begins in the house of the Lord and he
[1:31:21] begins to clean up the place and take
[1:31:24] out the uncleanness out of the house of
[1:31:26] God and out of the
[1:31:29] country he had it in his heart and then
[1:31:32] besides that he begins then he calls the
[1:31:35] young men and the young Levites and they
[1:31:38] hadn't been Sanctified they were Levites
[1:31:40] but they weren't Sanctified I think we
[1:31:43] probably got some Levites here that
[1:31:45] aren't Sanctified yet and he he called
[1:31:48] them because they just been living the
[1:31:50] the way that the world lived and he
[1:31:52] called them and said sanctify yourself
[1:31:55] become Sanctified cuz there's a work to
[1:31:58] do you've got to serve God and you can't
[1:32:01] serve in the way that you are sanctify
[1:32:07] yourself get ready to do something for
[1:32:10] God dedicate yourself sanctify
[1:32:14] yourself things are going to change
[1:32:16] around
[1:32:21] here and a man begin to sanctify
[1:32:24] themselves and get ready to serve
[1:32:29] God these aren't these aren't men that
[1:32:31] are 40 and 50 and 60 years old these are
[1:32:34] young
[1:32:35] men and there one thing that's unique
[1:32:37] about this congregation and I don't know
[1:32:40] why God has done it but I have a a
[1:32:42] belief that he called it for a certain
[1:32:44] reason to put men into a certain place
[1:32:47] of usefulness because it's needed in
[1:32:50] this message at this hour
[1:32:55] we need men with substance we need women
[1:32:58] with character and
[1:33:01] integrity I don't care how others are
[1:33:04] this is the way I
[1:33:09] am I'm dedicated we live straight to the
[1:33:17] line God begin to bless him and his
[1:33:21] pages long it's chapters long you can
[1:33:24] read it in Chronicles you can read it in
[1:33:26] Kings Chronicles has a beautiful a
[1:33:29] beautiful account as the Chronicles goes
[1:33:32] through the life of Hezekiah and he
[1:33:35] begins to clean out the nation and he
[1:33:38] smashes the he smashes down the altars
[1:33:41] and he crushes all the molten all the
[1:33:44] images and he gets rid of them so the
[1:33:46] people don't even have it before their
[1:33:48] eyes anymore and he begins to clean out
[1:33:51] the whole nation and turns the nation in
[1:33:53] the Bible says he did that which was
[1:33:56] right in the sight of
[1:34:01] God and it was a marvelous
[1:34:08] time you know some of you young
[1:34:10] people may have parents that don't even
[1:34:13] bring you to church but you're here
[1:34:15] now I want you to level with your
[1:34:18] parents you say you either take me to
[1:34:22] church and get get me to the house of
[1:34:25] God or I'm going to find a way or I'm
[1:34:27] going to get somebody to come and pick
[1:34:28] me up to your
[1:34:31] shame parents that are believers of this
[1:34:33] message and can't even get their
[1:34:35] families to church I say it's a
[1:34:37] disgrace there's no other word to
[1:34:40] it within an hour at least hour or hour
[1:34:44] and a half it's no great burden what if
[1:34:47] you in China what if you're someplace
[1:34:49] you had to take a train you had to go on
[1:34:52] a boat and try and get get there to
[1:34:54] church you be so hungry to be in the
[1:34:56] house of
[1:34:58] God say you got to realize that you're
[1:35:02] it's essential that you're hear and hear
[1:35:04] the word of God
[1:35:06] preached this is the thing that changed
[1:35:08] you it's reaching into your subconscious
[1:35:10] reaching into your critical mind but
[1:35:12] even beyond that and it's changing you I
[1:35:15] say in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ
[1:35:18] there's life character changing power in
[1:35:21] the word that we speak
[1:35:28] and they had a mighty
[1:35:30] Revival under
[1:35:33] Hezekiah it's really beautiful it's
[1:35:35] beautiful and it's bitter and it's sweet
[1:35:37] because it's sad
[1:35:42] also and he
[1:35:45] had he had all and God blessed
[1:35:49] him
[1:35:51] now I hope
[1:35:53] and I'm just going to take another 10
[1:35:56] minutes or
[1:35:58] so Hezekiah and I hope you can catch
[1:36:01] this Hezekiah came into a situation that
[1:36:04] I would say would be very reminiscent of
[1:36:07] the era when brother Brenham came in on
[1:36:10] the
[1:36:13] scene ecumenical movement on the
[1:36:16] way Christian businessmen taking their
[1:36:20] getting way out of control out of place
[1:36:23] through we're going to send the gospel
[1:36:25] out people who aren't called to the
[1:36:27] ministry women preaching theological
[1:36:31] schools full of training and the whole
[1:36:34] thing was bound up into hundreds of
[1:36:37] denominations all bound up and he even
[1:36:40] confessed that he felt his ministry was
[1:36:41] to break those walls down and let the
[1:36:44] water come in of the Holy Spirit and let
[1:36:46] the water rise and let the ducks start
[1:36:49] fellowshipping together and so there is
[1:36:52] an in all of these
[1:36:54] uh Gatherings it's just a hodge podge
[1:36:57] and there's a little man declaring it
[1:37:00] straight and delivering the word and
[1:37:03] cleaning up the place and cleaning up
[1:37:05] the temple and calling people to
[1:37:07] repentance and calling people to a
[1:37:09] baptism in the name of the Lord Jesus
[1:37:11] Christ and demonstrating the power of
[1:37:13] God and the blessings of God start to
[1:37:15] come and the people come out from among
[1:37:18] them and the blessings of God start to
[1:37:20] come upon them and the groups are
[1:37:23] blessed and they're Gathering here and
[1:37:24] Gathering there are you following me and
[1:37:27] a whole time of blessing comes it's a a
[1:37:30] whole era of Revival and a whole
[1:37:32] transformation of things that's
[1:37:39] happening Hezekiah made a fatal
[1:37:45] error and just prior to that he got sick
[1:37:49] to
[1:37:51] death and God sent Isaiah the Prophet to
[1:37:54] his place came imagine him coming to the
[1:37:57] palace and now here's a palace and God
[1:38:00] has so blessed this Judah under Hezekiah
[1:38:03] they had treasures and vessels and the
[1:38:07] whole nation was dedicated to God and
[1:38:10] the blessing of God was falling upon it
[1:38:12] and seemed and and God would give him
[1:38:15] Victory when armies would come against
[1:38:17] him it seemed like nothing could take
[1:38:19] him he was just in and and the country
[1:38:22] and the Nations hurting the
[1:38:24] glory under
[1:38:29] Hezekiah here come Isaiah says to him
[1:38:32] set your house in
[1:38:34] order you're going to
[1:38:38] die and the Bible says he turned his
[1:38:41] face to the wall you know how fast he
[1:38:43] did it he did it instantly he turned his
[1:38:46] face to the wall and he began to weep
[1:38:48] profusely and he says oh god I've walked
[1:38:52] perfect before are
[1:38:54] you and I can't set things in
[1:38:58] order immediately I need 15
[1:39:03] years and and Isaiah is just on his way
[1:39:07] and God says turn around and go back and
[1:39:11] tell Hezekiah I've heard his word and he
[1:39:14] goes back to Hezekiah and says the Lord
[1:39:17] has heard you and has added 15 years to
[1:39:20] your life and he says give me a sign and
[1:39:25] the sign was a sun dial whether it goes
[1:39:27] forward or it goes backward he said but
[1:39:29] it goes forward it's not such a great
[1:39:31] miracle but have it go
[1:39:33] backward and the sun dial went backward
[1:39:36] so many degrees as a sign I heard your
[1:39:39] prayer and you are healed brother
[1:39:41] brandom says he probably had cancer it
[1:39:43] says a boil in the Bible but he said a
[1:39:46] boil a person wouldn't normally die from
[1:39:49] a boil but it was some kind of a Cancer
[1:39:52] and God healed him
[1:40:00] and and and
[1:40:03] promptly
[1:40:05] promptly the king of Babylon from a far
[1:40:08] country heard about it you've heard of
[1:40:11] Babylon haven't you you know about
[1:40:13] Babylon don't you confusion of tongues
[1:40:17] babylon's in Genesis and babylon's in
[1:40:20] Revelation Babylon Babylon the greatest
[1:40:25] Fallen Babylon the mother of
[1:40:31] harlots Babylon set up
[1:40:36] by in Genesis I'm just trying to think
[1:40:39] of his name it's irrelevant right
[1:40:42] now
[1:40:45] right and he sends
[1:40:48] ambassadors he send some celebrities
[1:40:53] he sends some man of
[1:40:59] position and they come to hezakiah
[1:41:02] where from the king of Babylon and fact
[1:41:06] is I'm the
[1:41:08] son of baladan The
[1:41:11] King and I have come personally and I
[1:41:14] have letters from my
[1:41:16] father and we have
[1:41:20] gifts my father heard that you were sick
[1:41:24] and now we brought
[1:41:27] gifts and the Bible says so I don't know
[1:41:30] exactly what was in the letters but the
[1:41:32] Bible says and Hezekiah hearkened unto
[1:41:35] them so he listened to
[1:41:38] them and they must have had a
[1:41:41] request he begins to show him the
[1:41:45] glories of the house fatal
[1:41:48] mistake fatal error instead of saying oh
[1:41:53] take a message back to your father I was
[1:41:59] sick I was at the point of
[1:42:03] death but we have a prophet in the land
[1:42:07] and a prophet came to me and told me
[1:42:09] you're going to die and I begin to
[1:42:11] repent and I begin to weep and I told
[1:42:14] God I can't do it I can't do it I can't
[1:42:16] put my house in order I need 15 years
[1:42:19] and before the prophet even got to his
[1:42:21] home he was turned around and sent back
[1:42:24] to me and God gave me a message you
[1:42:27] shall live I've heard you I'm not sick
[1:42:30] I'm
[1:42:33] Healed but he was
[1:42:37] impressed he was
[1:42:39] impressed that a great
[1:42:42] king should send such Royal
[1:42:46] visitors he was impressed that they
[1:42:48] should send him a
[1:42:49] letter he was impressed that they should
[1:42:52] send him gifts
[1:42:55] and he was he was more impressed with
[1:42:57] that than he was with the very God who
[1:43:00] gave the
[1:43:02] vessels and he says come and I'll show
[1:43:05] you
[1:43:06] everything I'll show you and he begins
[1:43:09] to show a Godless King righteous vessels
[1:43:13] holy vessels Sanctified vessels and
[1:43:17] begins to expose them to this King and
[1:43:20] his people and Isaiah comes back to him
[1:43:24] with a message and Isaiah says who are
[1:43:27] these people that
[1:43:28] came oh he said they came from a far
[1:43:32] country even
[1:43:34] Babylon and what did they
[1:43:39] say and what did you
[1:43:42] do so I begin to show them
[1:43:46] everything and there was nothing that I
[1:43:49] didn't show them I showed them the
[1:43:50] treasures I showed them the stockpiles
[1:43:52] of the spices precious ointments I
[1:43:55] showed them absolutely everything and
[1:43:58] there's nothing in my house that I
[1:43:59] haven't shown them I showed them
[1:44:01] everything God gave us I showed them
[1:44:05] everything he was
[1:44:08] impressed and here was the here was the
[1:44:10] consequence of being impressed like
[1:44:13] that and Isaiah says hear the word of
[1:44:16] the
[1:44:17] Lord everything you showed them will go
[1:44:21] to Babylon
[1:44:24] and your sons that you haven't even
[1:44:25] begotten yet they're going to come out
[1:44:27] of your body they're going to take them
[1:44:29] there and make them Unix so they can't
[1:44:31] even have
[1:44:32] children and they'll be Unix in King
[1:44:37] baden's
[1:44:39] Kingdom and the very thing that you are
[1:44:42] impressed with you have
[1:44:48] become that time there was no repentance
[1:44:50] that would work nothing would work
[1:44:55] I know that you're
[1:44:57] thinking do you know that when a prophet
[1:44:59] of God you you hear these messages and
[1:45:04] listen I'm closing now in just a moment
[1:45:06] and you hear him scream out and you hear
[1:45:08] him preach his life out and you hear him
[1:45:11] pour His literal life stream out and
[1:45:14] he's pleading with the people and one of
[1:45:16] the big items in brother brandom's
[1:45:18] during that time was the influence of
[1:45:20] Hollywood and he could see that thing
[1:45:23] trying to invade and and and here was
[1:45:25] Pentecost with their gifts and the
[1:45:28] restoration and all of those things and
[1:45:30] here here's a prophet trying to make a
[1:45:32] line of Distinction we're not like those
[1:45:35] we're not part of those Nations we're
[1:45:37] not part of those denominations we're
[1:45:40] not all one we're not one he
[1:45:50] said and I say this
[1:45:53] they were impressed with the people and
[1:45:56] the celebrities that were coming
[1:46:00] in and they that were impressed by it
[1:46:04] have become
[1:46:06] it and Hollywood has taken
[1:46:09] over the whole thing what they call
[1:46:12] fundamental religion Hollywood has
[1:46:15] infiltrated it and the thing that they
[1:46:17] were impressed with has shaped them into
[1:46:20] the same thing until they use the same
[1:46:23] terminology and people get on the
[1:46:25] platform and it's featuring this singer
[1:46:27] and featuring that singer and featuring
[1:46:30] this Entertainer the whole thing is
[1:46:32] Hollywood from the bottom up because
[1:46:34] it's
[1:46:36] Babylon and you know that's
[1:46:38] true you can't even see it but it turns
[1:46:41] you ill inside we say how are we
[1:46:44] different thank God for a message I
[1:46:47] can't shout it out I can't I haven't got
[1:46:48] enough voice thank God for something
[1:46:51] that has cleansed us thank God for the
[1:46:53] washing of the water of the word thank
[1:46:55] God for a standard to live
[1:47:01] to there was no recovery from
[1:47:06] that and now we started out we started
[1:47:09] out in a house with a
[1:47:13] ly in Ohio we started in a there was a
[1:47:16] double
[1:47:18] garage and I I remember standing in that
[1:47:21] double garage and I thought
[1:47:25] how what a paradox and how wonderful
[1:47:27] this is here's people that are working
[1:47:31] factories here's a brother over here
[1:47:33] he's a bean
[1:47:36] farmer here's gladon here's brother Bill
[1:47:39] da chairman of a
[1:47:41] bank all sitting there in little chairs
[1:47:43] shoulder toosh
[1:47:45] shoulder multimillionaire over there
[1:47:48] Bean farmer over here man who works in a
[1:47:51] factory and and had actually it was his
[1:47:53] home that we're in we're there we'll
[1:47:58] walk in the
[1:47:59] light oh it's a beautiful
[1:48:02] light on the wings of Snow White du and
[1:48:08] in that beauty and in that Simplicity
[1:48:11] here's the people
[1:48:12] Gathering and little groups here and
[1:48:15] little groups
[1:48:16] there are you still with
[1:48:20] me and God moving sovereign ly
[1:48:23] remarkably moving and people yielding to
[1:48:26] it just giving themselves to
[1:48:29] it but I fear I have a great concern L
[1:48:33] as time goes
[1:48:35] on I don't know could you still want to
[1:48:37] meet in the
[1:48:39] house I was president of a company
[1:48:42] because we were trying to support the
[1:48:44] work and I knew this message had it and
[1:48:48] soon as soon as young people would come
[1:48:49] in give their life to Christ I said go
[1:48:51] right downstairs and plug yourself into
[1:48:54] the tapes you can get something there
[1:48:56] that I can't give you get right into the
[1:48:58] tapes and hear those and they would hear
[1:49:00] those as they weren't interested in a
[1:49:01] whole lot of things they took time and
[1:49:03] they just listened to the tapes and a
[1:49:04] lot of those people are sitting here in
[1:49:06] the congregation today I say glory be to
[1:49:09] God and it began to cultivate young men
[1:49:12] and cultivate families and cultivate
[1:49:15] children and cultivate preachers that
[1:49:18] are out preaching today because it's the
[1:49:20] same word
[1:49:24] and the
[1:49:25] planks were just 2 by1 or 2x 12 unplaned
[1:49:29] rough planks sitting on blocks of
[1:49:32] wood and I say to this congregation
[1:49:35] would you be satisfied with
[1:49:38] that we'd be satisfied to come in next
[1:49:41] Sunday say well that's where we start
[1:49:43] sometime we say well it's so cold well
[1:49:44] it's so hot well it's so this well so
[1:49:47] that but what it is is so spoiled
[1:49:52] and I think that you know preaching
[1:49:54] really you know the preacher is really
[1:49:56] going Beyond his time he's taking a lot
[1:49:58] of Liberty this is the
[1:50:00] truth this what we need this the kind of
[1:50:04] instruction we need and there's a danger
[1:50:06] that then when things get all you know
[1:50:08] so blessed and so blessed and then those
[1:50:11] with no experience no conviction no
[1:50:14] nothing just say oh we heard and this
[1:50:18] what I closed with last Sunday we heard
[1:50:21] we've heard we heard from so so and so
[1:50:23] somebody told us and so and so told us
[1:50:25] what's happening told us about your
[1:50:26] young people told us about your families
[1:50:28] told us about your school told us about
[1:50:30] something else oh that kind of
[1:50:32] impression I'm not impressed
[1:50:35] with and hezekiah's big mistake is he
[1:50:38] was not impressed with the vessels that
[1:50:41] God had given him but he was impressed
[1:50:43] with the recognition that he got because
[1:50:46] of his riches and today I want to end
[1:50:49] this service by saying I'm impressed I'm
[1:50:51] not impressed with this building I'm not
[1:50:54] impressed with our equipment I'm not
[1:50:56] impressed with all the music and and all
[1:50:59] all all the uh video things and I'm
[1:51:03] impressed with the people I'm impressed
[1:51:05] with dedicated men I'm impressed with a
[1:51:08] sanctification I'm impressed with
[1:51:10] Integrity I'm impressed with the
[1:51:13] vessels and I'm impressed that God has
[1:51:16] said you are my particular peculiar
[1:51:21] treasure amen you are the treasure
[1:51:24] you're the
[1:51:26] treasure not going to allow the devil to
[1:51:30] mop up his Temple
[1:51:35] floors I see listen I'm pretty well
[1:51:39] read and I'm in contact and I see how
[1:51:42] other I see how other organizations
[1:51:46] worship and I see the direction they're
[1:51:49] going and if you have contact with it
[1:51:51] make sure that you're the
[1:51:53] influence make sure that we're not
[1:51:55] impressed with something else out there
[1:51:58] I'm not impressed with finer
[1:52:01] things I'm not impressed with the things
[1:52:04] of the world I'm not impressed with
[1:52:06] Hollywood coming into the church I'm not
[1:52:09] impressed with the fashion of the world
[1:52:11] and if you see that this is what this
[1:52:13] this is what they do out there this is
[1:52:15] what they do this is what young people
[1:52:16] do get away from it move away from it
[1:52:21] can you say amen amen young people can
[1:52:23] you say
[1:52:25] amen God bless
[1:52:30] [Applause]
[1:52:44] you brother Bram spoke some great things
[1:52:47] about
[1:52:50] Hezekiah he was certainly a great
[1:52:53] King but I don't want to make hezekiah's
[1:52:56] error and the Bible says that we are to
[1:52:59] learn by those
[1:53:01] things say do you have any concerns
[1:53:04] about brother Ed do you have any
[1:53:06] concerns about Bible Way yeah I do L we
[1:53:10] become too prosperous too
[1:53:14] refined too
[1:53:16] fussy too stuffy too
[1:53:21] formal that we lose some of that
[1:53:24] reality some of that
[1:53:26] genuiness we get too too much pride too
[1:53:30] much you know I'm afraid somebody's
[1:53:31] going to see me who
[1:53:33] cares we need people to yield to
[1:53:41] God and that least little twins
[1:53:45] inside listen to that voice do what it
[1:53:50] says so whatever I go to the front
[1:53:52] repent what are people going to think
[1:53:54] who cares what they think do what the
[1:53:57] holy spirit
[1:54:06] says what will other churches think what
[1:54:09] will other people think we don't care
[1:54:11] what they think they're not our
[1:54:15] standard this church that church this
[1:54:17] message believer that preacher we're not
[1:54:20] we're not subject to that we're subject
[1:54:22] to what the Holy Spirit speaks in this
[1:54:27] place we need the support of everyone we
[1:54:31] need the support of everyone I say
[1:54:34] sanctify
[1:54:35] yourselves to our god sanctify
[1:54:39] yourselves I can't sanctify you you
[1:54:41] sanctify yourself before
[1:54:45] God
[1:54:49] hallelujah will you stand with me
[1:55:08] we just go to
[1:55:11] prayer
[1:55:13] father you've seen what's going on in my
[1:55:16] heart these last
[1:55:18] days and how I wondered I wondered I was
[1:55:21] so
[1:55:22] twisted up

[1:55:44] actually developed an acceptability
[1:55:47] they've been accepted and recognized as
[1:55:50] something but perhaps deep down in their
[1:55:52] heart
[1:55:54] today there is a witness inside by the
[1:55:57] holy
[1:55:58] spirit that is urging
[1:56:01] them others it might be cautioning them
[1:56:05] that something they're allowing does not
[1:56:07] take them in a Godly way and they need
[1:56:10] to turn from that they need to return
[1:56:13] they're hearing the voice return return
[1:56:16] come back into the
[1:56:18] path they may be hearing the voice of
