[0:00] that's God's opportunity that's God's
[0:02] way of getting to us is when we're weak
[0:06] we get something in this encourages of
[0:08] course because God's whole kingdom is
[0:10] built out of these kind of people then
[0:12] when you get to that kind of a way then
[0:14] you you can you're in his kingdom the
[0:16] case is with us that not that we are too
[0:19] weak the case is we're too strong amen
[0:23] we we're we're just too strong that's
[0:25] all the thing of it is we're too Str
[0:27] stronge
[0:28] headed that's right too strong in our
[0:30] head we know too much God wants to get
[0:34] that out of us Mercy on us this morning
[0:37] that's right we're too strong we're too
[0:40] strong to yield to him we got we we
[0:43] yield to ourselves we got to think uh
[0:47] well I here I I got sense enough to know
[0:50] I was amazed a few nights ago when Mama
[0:53] was sick out the
[0:54] hospital I went to there's a little lady
[0:57] next door a that little lady's here you
[0:59] forgive me sister
[1:00] she's a little Kentucky girl from down
[1:02] there and we was and that was her
[1:04] mother-in-law and I was talking to her
[1:07] that night wife and out there along
[1:08] about 1:00 in the morning and her
[1:10] husband laid down on the floor went to
[1:12] sleep she said get out of here you're no
[1:15] good to your mamy anyhow and running out
[1:18] her husband out of the room because he's
[1:19] laying right straight across the door
[1:20] where nurse and nobody getting his
[1:21] snoring away on the floor so she got him
[1:24] up and run him out and she got to talk
[1:27] in there I got talking to her about the
[1:29] Lord and so forth and she said well she
[1:32] said all I ever know was a goose neck
[1:33] hole in a Tobacco Patch early of the
[1:36] morning cutting out the weed and sucker
[1:38] and tobacco and so forth like that said
[1:40] but I tell you he said papy sent us
[1:42] everyone to school and said we still
[1:43] ain't got no
[1:44] sense I thought well maybe that's the
[1:49] reason see you you got to keep the
[1:52] things of the world from
[1:55] you I'm not supporting ignorance not
[1:58] that but I'm trying to think when you
[2:00] get to a place where you think that you
[2:01] just you just know so much that nobody
[2:03] else knows anything about it your
[2:05] knowledge is all right as long as it
[2:06] don't as it don't interfere with the
[2:09] promises of God
