Sister Elena's got a special for us and a couple of others. So maybe they could come and get ready at this time. Just as soon as they're done, we'll turn the service to our pastor and you can come and speak what the Lord has laid on our hearts. I trust it's like going to the refrigerator. You know, you need something that's inside the fridge. You're not quite sure what it is. And when you open it up, something inside calls to what's in there. And it says, "That's what I'm craving." And we've come that way this morning. Open hearts. Lord, we're coming to the service. I have a need. I have something that I'm craving inside me. We're looking to you to supply that need. &gt;&gt; Amen. We'll just come with open hearts this morning. Just one more quick announcement before they sing. How many brothers and sisters have been able to help at BCA? Build build BCA. Why don't you stand up so we can recognize you this morning? You've just done a little something. If you've put your shoulder all the way to the wheel, I know there's Where's Brother Kim Dingwall? He's got both shoulders against the wheel. He's got both feet digging into the ground. Brother Peta, Brother Mark, I know many of you have done so, so very much. And we so appreciate that. Can we give him a round of applause? Don't sit down yet. Don't sit down. I know it's Don't sit down yet. Don't sit down. For the rest of us brothers, and I'm physically sitting down, it doesn't look like it. We can get behind them and we can help them. Do you believe that? &gt;&gt; I believe it. The rest of us brothers that are still sitting down and comfortable in our chairs, they need help. &gt;&gt; The school still needs to be built. &gt;&gt; And I confess, I commit. I'm on camera. I'm in front of you. I will be there. I will help. I have a camp to to run, too. I know you have jobs to go to, too. So, we'll all do our part. Amen. God bless you this morning. Amen. We certainly appreciate all that's gone into the the efforts of the school. I believe in September there's a very strong possibility we can have our children in the school. And I think that's just a wonderful, wonderful thing. God bless you this morning as you enjoy the special. [Music] Laying on the battlefield, [Music] lost and all alone, the soldier lies there. are wounded and cannot carry on. So let his faithful comrades rise and take up the call and search for those too weak to fight or those about to fall. [Music] Not a one will be forgotten. Not a one will be left behind. Those who fall in sin, he will seek out again and give us strength to go and find. Not a one will be left behind. [Music] All along this narrow road, lives fall like grave. Their love that once was burning bright, now covered by their pain. So let us go and take the light to them that are afraid and carry forth the word to those longing to be saved. Not a one can be forgotten. Not a one can be left behind. Those who fall in sin, he will seek out again and give us strength to go and find. [Music] Not a one can be left behind. And when we stand with them in glory, may we hear them say, "Someone rescued me that day. Not one [Music] was forgotten. Not one was there. left behind. Those who fell in sin, he sought out again and gave us strength to go and find. Not a one was left behind. Not a one will be forgotten, not a one will be left behind. [Music] Those who fall in sin, he will seek out again and give us strength to go and find. Not a one will be left. Not a one will be left. Not a one will be left behind. [Music] Thank for that special. Sister Elena wrote that special I believe uh just before or just after winter camp. I believe that that's one of our desires to not leave one behind. Amen. As our pastor comes this morning in the Sunday school, children are coming in. Why don't we sing together? We are the generation. We're the culmination. [Music] We are the generation. [Music] My voice [Music] of the Lord is here. The revelation for coming temptation will go to every nation. [Music] We are the children generation. We are generation. We are nation [Music] the world. The revelation overcoming sin tempation. [Applause] We are the generation. [Music] I just want to please the Lord. Be in his will in every way. I just want to please the Lord. [Music] Be in his will in every way. To be lost in his presence. found in his likeness to hear him say, "Well done." Someday he is in every way. to be lost in his presence, found in his likeness to hear you say, "Well done, son." God bless you, Sister Sally. Good to see you this morning. Oh, I just want to please the Lord. [Music] Be in his will in every way to be lost in his presence. [Music] found in his [Music] hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Good to be in the house of God. Last Sunday, uh, my wife and I were away and for about 3 4 days and visiting her brother and sister, Sister Dorothy McGown, who many of you know and uh uh her brother is 88 years old and moving him from a home where he lived for over 60 years uh into an apartment and Uh, of course she's been Sister Ruth has held on to him in her heart of faith for salvation. And uh, that's what we just continue to establish our testimony. Eternity is a long time. Fact is, it's not even a long time. It's forever. &gt;&gt; And so, whatever we can do down here, &gt;&gt; we better do it now. &gt;&gt; Do you agree? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Well, this is Mother's Day. Is this Mother's Day? We have a lot of mothers. And I'm glad that we do or I wouldn't be here. &gt;&gt; Neither would you. We have our mothers to honor and be very thankful. Brother Brennham spoke about spoke a message actually uh Mother's Day and I just thought that I would like to read some of his comments. He said, "Mother's Day should be every day. &gt;&gt; Not just to send a bunch of flowers on Mother's Day, but to love her and care for her 365 days and nights through the year." The commercial world has uh a great hold on in things like this and it depreciates mother. &gt;&gt; It depreciates mother. You might uh not understand that but if you don't just to buy a piece of just to buy a few flowers and take it over can depreciate mother because if that may be replacing something else we should be doing. And he goes on to say she'd appreciate a whole lot more just to sit down and talk to her just a little bit. Write her a line. Pat her on the shoulder, kiss her on the cheek, tell her you love her. It'll it'll go a lot further than all the flowers that you could buy from the florist. Some of us can't do that. Our mothers aren't here. Our mothers are gone. Our mothers are far away, but you could call or write or say something. Then he refers to the the film by Cecil uh De Mills, The Ten Commandments, and he said that he'd seen it, the the film The Ten Commandments, and he said a little remark always stuck with him after Moses had found out that he was a Hebrew and he decided to dwell with his people. And there sat his once beautiful mother, faded out with her gray hair and her wrinkled face, sitting in an old armchair, a typical mother. And and Pharaoh's daughter came in and Moses said, "Who son am I?" And when it was brought to light that Jacobed, Jockabed was his real mother, the daughter of Pharaoh with her paint and so forth and all fixed up. She said, "But look, he may be your son, but she said, I gave him wealth and splendor. You could have you you could give him nothing but the slime pits." But the aged gay-haired mother said, "But I give him life." And that makes the difference. I gave him life &gt;&gt; and God gave him eternal life. He said, "How true." &gt;&gt; He said, "I want to take his theme." Brother Brandham was taking a theme on a subject and he said, "And take another picture of what mother is." He said, "Most every message has got something about the resurrection. It's the cardinal resting place of the gospel. If he did not rise again from the dead, then all of us was in vain. He said it's the crowning of our consolation, the resurrection. I think it's the great coronation of the full gospel is the resurrection and the divine promises and the consolation that it gives those who are trusting in it. For it promises the great union of our uniting together again. It gives us the promise that someday that these old, weakening, feebled, gay-headed, broke down mothers will be changed. Not only will mother sit there by herself, but all of her family with her. And what a day that will be. &gt;&gt; And I would just like to add this scripture. All things are possible to them that believe. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. It's irrelevant to me what the state of the family is. But what is relevant is what is the mother believing. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Mother's love is very powerful and strong. And he says, "And what a day that will be. What a time it will be when we look upon the faces of those who we have loved so well. What a difference on that morning when we shall see our loved ones and to watch what they'll be. Then all the affliction will be taken away. All the mars of suffering will be done. No more pale cheeks of death. No more tears from the eyes. The resurrection promises. all of this. &gt;&gt; When we see them standing yonder, our loved ones, our mothers, our kindreds, all of our friends, and to see them in their immortal bodies, their celestial bodies. Listen, friends, that ought to send shivers right down through our entire being that this is the reality. &gt;&gt; It's not the reality is not sitting here on a Sunday morning. The reality is here hearing the words of a prophet and speak about the time that is to come. That's the reality. &gt;&gt; Is it a reality to you? &gt;&gt; And their celestial bodies watching their character, seeing how they conduct themselves with the sweetness and quietness. No more nervousness or flusterations. You've had them this week. We all have. You won't have them. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. There's another gathering time. That's why we're here. &gt;&gt; Amen. To prepare for that time. &gt;&gt; To see them standing in the likeness of the Lord Jesus. That'll be a wonderful day. And each one of us in our minds are anticipating and longing for that hour of consolation when we meet them. Each one is thinking of their loved one. Maybe their mother that's gone on. And what a day it'll be when we see her again. And to dad and to brother and to all the loved ones, what a day it will be. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. That's why I stand behind the pulpit this morning because that's a reality. &gt;&gt; And he said the the almost every message has the resurrection in it. &gt;&gt; Praise God. &gt;&gt; Praise God. Praise God. &gt;&gt; I say praise God. Amen. &gt;&gt; He's greater &gt;&gt; than every demon force. &gt;&gt; He's greater than the deceiver. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He's greater than the powers of hell &gt;&gt; that bind the souls of man. He's greater than that deceiver who tries to attract the young people. My God is greater. &gt;&gt; Calvary is greater. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; He's greater than any darkness. He's greater than any other ambition. &gt;&gt; Yes, he is. &gt;&gt; God knows how to turn people around, folks. &gt;&gt; And we need to believe that. &gt;&gt; Greater is he that's in you than he that's in the world. &gt;&gt; Who is it that he Who is he referring to he in the world? &gt;&gt; Satan. &gt;&gt; Greater is he that is in you. &gt;&gt; We must believe that. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Well, I'm not preaching yet, but we're working up to it. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Isn't that wonderful? &gt;&gt; And I'm glad for this. I'm glad for the school &gt;&gt; and the teachers &gt;&gt; and what has been happening. I'm glad for it. &gt;&gt; I'll tell you why. Because it's uh if there's any time that goes on, we have a future. We have and and they are that future. We have some that are teenagers and in a short time they're going to be 18, 19, 20 perhaps and entering into married life and whatever more. We have children and I just want to speak about the the progress of the of the school for a moment and I'll tell you why I'm burdened. It's not just another building. It is not that. But the progress of the school has been absolutely remarkable and it is largely remarkable because of uh brother Kim Dingwall and the time that he has given. He has given himself unreservedly to that work and I think the congregation knows that and [Music] and there's much that isn't known. It's all the negotiation and uh doing everything that he can to get everything. Uh my wife and I speak about it quite often that he's the right the right person. No one else could do it just like that because he has the right character and the right type of approach to people and where someone else might be confrontational he achieves uh better things than greater things. uh just the other day, in fact, is they just uh dropped off this last week the entire uh wiring system, the uh I should say the breaker system for all the electrics in the entire building. And it was his thought to have it all come into one location uh and uh and the brothers have been engaged in it. But when he called the head man of square D and there they build some of the best there is. in fact is I think they are the best and these huge huge this is several feet high and several feet wide and the the total cost of those is to buy them is $54,000. and he called this man. He says, "We're on another charity project and because he had done some up in in Alberta in Edmonton and uh asked him, you know, what he could do, do his best. Well, that's not enough." And finally, the man is just I won't say exasperated, but he said, "You know, what do you want me to do?" And finally, we got those $54,000 worth of switch gear for $18,000. Uh that's just oneird of the I don't I know they can't build it for that price. So we want to thank God first and that's just one of many many it just happens all the time but there's and and Ben uh Dingwal has given his time and I don't know just how this is going to work out but he's just there every day and I don't know I he he can't have his other job. They must have fired him a long time ago. and brother Gil Ashdown. He just retired from Finning Tractor and I'm so glad he retired because we hired him right away and we're going to pay him in the rapture. And so many others have been coming on a regular basis and uh brother Mark Powell has been been there. I think that's his his uh second job. And uh I can't begin to mention all that have been there, but I would like those that have uh worked at the school. I don't care if you've only been there half a day, but those that have been at the school and and the sisters that have cooked or cooked at home and contributed, sent something in. I'd like you just to stand for a moment if you would do that, please. The young people, have you been there? They had a professional uh day the other day at the school and uh the school was shut down, but they had all the young people go over and I think that was just wonderful. Uh I want to say to all of you, thank you. And for those that haven't had opportunity to go there, I would encourage you to take a day and uh give some time. I'll tell you why. I think that if we really put an effort to it, listen to me now, I believe we can make it by September. &gt;&gt; Now, that's asking for another miracle, but why not ask for a miracle? And if you have any time, uh, you could certainly do that. Now, you that are standing and you that are sitting, I realize that some are not able to be there. You're some distance away. And this isn't to embarrass anybody, but I just want to say something to you. The children that are going to be go to that school according to this book, God's holy word, their angels are constantly before the face of almighty God. They're before the face of God. And if and if God would see that we are so concerned and we are so interested that we are seeking to have a place where they can be under the atmosphere of Holy Ghost teachers, &gt;&gt; an atmosphere of people who pray, &gt;&gt; people who believe this message, just to have them in that atmosphere. What they're going to do, what those young people are going to do, we don't know. But we know one thing. We're contributing. &gt;&gt; Contributing to their upbringing. Amen. &gt;&gt; God bless you each one as you have your seats. We appreciate it and we would just like to encourage you to do everything you can. Every spare moment you say, "Well, we're I know that some are getting burned out. I know I told Brother Peter, I think I I saw him there yesterday again. I think he lives there. Every time I go there, he's there. I don't know when he works, but it's it's uh Yeah. You think that it's just another building? No, it's not. No, it just isn't. It isn't another building. It's the only place. If you knew, I'm not able to tell you, but if you knew what some of these people have gone through and are going through, just to see that their children can be in that atmosphere, it humbles me and causes me to want to do everything that I can to have them there. It's no, it's no feather in my hat at all. I love the young people and the children and I think those blessed innocent lives deserve the best. &gt;&gt; I I I really Oh, this is going on internet. But I tell you what, I drove past a school here when one of my daughters had to be in that school and there they all around in a little bit of a huddle and little we teeny boppers and puffing on their cigarettes. I just slammed on my brakes, threw my door open and ran across the street. And I tell you what, I skinned those kids and they turned white. And I think I was probably white, too. It says, "Be angry and sin not." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And I was angry at the devil. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I was angry that those kids were getting trapped in that kind of a thing. And how I would love to see that they don't have to be in that kind of an atmosphere. And everybody here ought to support that 100%. &gt;&gt; You want to have them hear their old filthy stories and cursings and going I I'd say we ought to do everything in our power to see that their ears aren't subjected to that. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Well, so much for that. I wonder if we can sing. I am amazed that he loved me. &gt;&gt; Can we help me out, would you? But &gt;&gt; let's stand up, shall we? That he loved me. Heat. Heat. Yeah. Heat. [Applause] [Music] Heat. Heat. [Music] Heat. Heat. I for [Music] how do we thank you? How do we bring our offering to you? &gt;&gt; How do we bring our praise to you, oh God? We just pray that you will look upon our hearts and see what's in our hearts, Lord. How we desire to lift you up. How we desire to make the name of our Lord Jesus Christ known. All glory, all hail the power of Jesus' name. Let angels prostrate fall. Bring forth the royal diadem and crown him Lord of all. Glory be to your name. Be glorified now in the words that are going to be spoken. Be glorified, oh God, in the hearts of your people. For the kingdom of God is here represented amongst your children. We pray, Father, you'll anoint your people, anoint your word, forgive us for any wrong that we have done. May we be washed and cleansed and holy before you in Jesus Christ's name. Let the Holy Spirit reveal the word, oh God. Do more than we can even anticipate or expect or ask for in Jesus Christ's name. We thank you now. Amen. Amen. I'll invite you to turn to your Bible to Exodus the 12th chapter. And I would ask for your undivided attention. Sometimes we approach subjects that we are you may hear things that you've heard before or reference uh reference to scriptures and statements we I have made before but uh there's a area of this subject that I uh just I am not able to completely explore but I feel that I should approach it anyhow and see just how God will deal with deal with our hearts. In Exodus 12, we start at verse one. And the Lord spake unto Moses and Aaron in the land of Egypt, saying, "This month shall be unto you the beginning of months. It shall be the first month of the year to you. Speak unto all the congregation of Israel, saying, In the 10th day of this month, they shall take to them every man a lamb according to the house of their fathers, a lamb for an house. And if the household be too little for the lamb, let him and his neighbor next unto his house take it according to the number of the souls, every man according to his eating shall uh make your count for the lamb. Your lamb shall be without blemish, a male of the first year. You shall take it out from the sheep or from the goats, and you shall keep it up until the 14th day of the same month. And the whole assembly of the congregation of Israel shall kill it in the evening. And they shall take the blood and strike it on the two side posts, and on the upper doorposts of the houses wherein they shall eat it. And I'm going to skip from seven down to 13. And the blood shall be to you for a token upon the houses where you are. And when I see the blood, I will pass over you, and the plague shall not be upon you to destroy you when I smite the land of Egypt. &gt;&gt; I'd like you then to turn also to Isaiah the 53rd chapter, and we'll begin reading at verse one. Isaiah 53. Who hath believed our report? And to whom is the arm of the Lord revealed? For he shall grow up before him as a tender plant, and as a root out of dry ground. He hath no form or comeliness. And when we shall see him, there is no beauty that we should be that we should desire him. He is despised and rejected of men, a man of sorrows, and acquainted with grief. And we hid as it wear our faces from him. He was despised, and we esteemed him not. Surely he hath borne our griefs, and carried our sorrows. Yet we did esteem him stricken, smitten of God, and afflicted. And he was wounded for our transgressions. He was bruised for our iniquities. And the chastisement of our peace was upon him. And with his stripes we are healed. All we like sheep have gone astray. We have turned everyone to his own way. And the Lord hath laid on him the iniquity of us all. He was oppressed and he was afflicted. Yet he opened not his mouth. He is brought as a lamb to the slaughter and as a sheep. before her shears is dumb. So he opened not his mouth. He was taken from prison and from judgment. And who shall declare his generation? For he was cut off out of the land of the living. For the transgression of my people was he stricken. And he made his grave with the wicked and with the rich in his death. Because he had done no violence. Neither was any deceit in his mouth. Yet it pleased the Lord to bruise him. He hath put him to grief when thou shalt make his soul an offering for sin. He shall see his seed. He shall prolong his days, and the pleasure of the Lord shall prosper in his hand. He shall see the travail of his soul, and shall be satisfied. By his knowledge shall my righteous servant justify many, for he shall bear their iniquities. Therefore will I divide him a portion with the great and he shall divide the spoil with the strong because he hath poured out his soul unto death. Remember now the soul is the nature of the life and that's what Adam lost. And he shall pour out his soul unto death and he was numbered with the transgressors and he bear the sin of many and made intercession for the transgressors. Amen. God bless you as you have your seats and keep your attention to these words which we have read. The Passover lamb in the first Exodus, the Passover lamb was to be without blemish. However, the most perfect lamb that they could find amongst their herds could never fulfill the required meaning of blemish. Brother Brandham refers to words. He says we could say the word bored. Well, a board could be this. You could leave the service this morning and say, "I was just bored." You could have a a uh some kind of a game board. Uh you could have board say, "Well, I have room and board. I'm living here and I have room and board." And it's one word bored. Although maybe spelled slight slightly different, it is sounds the same. And the one word in English has many many different meanings. The word blemish in to us uh that speak the English language or have learned the English language, we understand a blemish to be a mark or a flaw or a uh uh something that an imperfection or something that spoils the appearance of something. It has a a blemish on it. It could be a blemish on a person's body or a blemish on a piece of uh work that we're doing. And a blemish also can be to spoil a reputation. Someone has a a reputation and something has taken place and it's a blemish uh a mark on them. But the blemish in the Hebrew is very very different. And it is this blemish is complete. Something that is complete, something that is whole, something that is entire. Something that is healthful, something that is unimpaired, something that is innocent, something that has integrity. This isn't a blemish like a mark that is spoiled. This is a that it must be without blemish. Something that is uh entirely in accord and and with truth and fact. It can't be something that is is just you know similar or something. It has to be in truth and it is actually in fact this is you can speak about an animal and I've heard them speak of horses for example and the integrity of the animal which has something to do with its breeding and something to do with the its structure and the way that it it's is very complete. It's a it has integrity as a as an animal. And so uh this lamb of the Old Testament, it could never complete and fully uh be what the word blemish was. But they were to do their utmost go and find a lamb of the first year. And this lamb is to be without blemish. It also is uh something not only to complete but to be finished to be at an end to be completely crossed over. And I want to approach that from this direction. God completely crossed over in the lamb of God that we know as Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; Amen. He completely crossed over the great chasm that was that could not be crossed. when Lazarus the beggar died and the rich man died and the rich man he was in torment and he wanted Lazarus to dip his finger in water and cool his tongue and uh and he cried out to father Abraham and and and and the one he was speaking to responded and said that there's a great chasm &gt;&gt; between fixed between you and I &gt;&gt; and no one from here can go there and no one from there could go here. Listen to me friends as we're sitting here today. There's people in both both places. &gt;&gt; There are people that are in torment. &gt;&gt; There are people that will be in a state of torment and and seeing a cross or some how but it's a chasm that is fixed. But God crossed over that chasm. Amen. &gt;&gt; God came from the realms and the portals of glory and bliss and holiness and purity and came down into this Satan's Eden. &gt;&gt; Amen. The Bible says to it that God was in Christ, reconciling the world unto himself, not imputing their transgressions, uh, trespasses rather, unto them, but and hath committed unto us the word of reconciliation. No man has ever been able to cross, but God crossed over. In other words, this is part of bringing this without blemish. That lamb that they slayed was not able to even touch or had no knowledge of a chasm. right? &gt;&gt; Could not complete the act of being a he was a Passover lamb only foreshadowing that there was something coming, &gt;&gt; something that could cross over, &gt;&gt; something that could reach a fallen man, &gt;&gt; something that could come back to humanity and reconcile him back to God. &gt;&gt; That lamb could not do it. Brother Brandham said in the voice of the sign he said you remember the rich man in Lazarus there's a great gulf betw twix you and he that no man has ever crossed or ever will cross in the message fellowship he said the super sign Jehovah as a boy playing Jehovah a man toiling uh in the carpenter shop Jehovah himself made flesh and dwelt among And I love this phrase, stretched his tent &gt;&gt; down here. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Made himself a body to live in to have a blood cell. And that that blood cell could be broken. Hallelujah. That was the lamb of God that was slain from the foundation of the world to and brings us eternal redemption. The Bible said so here. It brought us eternal redemption and we are purchased by the precious blood of Jesus Christ which was given which has given us eternal life. And how did he do it? He said I don't know. &gt;&gt; We don't know how he did it but he did it. &gt;&gt; He crossed over part of blemish. He'll be without blemish. &gt;&gt; He must be able to achieve this. &gt;&gt; And be not afraid. He said he was the son of God but yet he was God. God changed his cast from a spirit and stretched his tent uh and began he become us. He become us that we through his grace might become him. And that's the phrase I believe that inspired brother Donnie Reagan uh to write that course. He became me that I could become him. &gt;&gt; Amen. And in the message identified uh identified Christ of all ages. He said look at Mary. He said I believe she was a virgin woman certainly but she was just an incubator that God used to bring Christ to the earth. &gt;&gt; I tell you these are such powerful so profound statements. You won't hear this in a Bible school. &gt;&gt; You won't hear this by some theology. And here we sit as humble people. He believing this word take it into your heart &gt;&gt; and even if you just say I believe that &gt;&gt; God will honor that &gt;&gt; and brought used to bring Christ to the earth the house that God stretched his tent from being Jehovah to man. He was Emmanuel God dwelling among us camping with us. God handled in the flesh. God housed in a tent called a man that was the son of God. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Now listen as we just make our way. You're listening close and I'm I I appreciate that. And lo a voice Matthew records in Matthew 3:17. And low a voice from heaven saying this is my son my beloved. This is my beloved son in whom I'm well pleased. But he wasn't wounded yet. He wasn't bruised yet. He hadn't fulfilled any of Isaiah 53 yet. He just came up from baptism. &gt;&gt; He didn't have a flaw yet. He didn't have a mar yet. He didn't feel the suffering of your sin and mine. And God is saying, "This is my beloved son in whom I'm well pleased." &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Then in Matthew 16 and coming into Matthew 17, the last verses of Matthew 16, Jesus said, "There are some here that will not taste of death until they see the kingdom coming, the the glory of God and the kingdom coming." Maybe I'll just read that so I have it exactly right. Verily I say unto you, there be some standing here which shall not taste of death till they see the Son of Man coming in his kingdom. &gt;&gt; And after a few And after six days, Jesus taketh Peter, James, and John, those three up into a high mountain apart. And he was transfigured before them. And his face did shine as the sun, and his raignment was white as light. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And behold, there appeared Moses and Elijah &gt;&gt; talking with him. And as we've said before, and it's not new to most of you, but there was you were represented on that mountain. &gt;&gt; If you have eternal life, I'll read a quote for you. Brother Brandham says, "You were there. &gt;&gt; If you have eternal life, which could only come from Christ, you were there on the mountain. &gt;&gt; You're not just represented there, but you were there on the mountain. very life that you have in you was there on the mountain. &gt;&gt; But this time Jesus is glorified. &gt;&gt; Yes. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Still has no marks. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; No. He wasn't there bruised. He wasn't there with a visage that was marred more than that of any man. He wasn't there with nail scars in his hand. He wasn't there with a spear in his side. And once again the voice cried out and said this is my beloved son &gt;&gt; in whom I'm well pleased. So now we have we have the voice saying this is my beloved son before the marring. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Before the flaw. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; And the same thing being said after. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It all happened. once before and once after because the after he's glorified. &gt;&gt; Now this is very significant in the Easter seal. He said, "Now look at the transfiguration. We're all represented there in transfiguration. Look what we are seeing." Notice just what we are seeing today. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Quickening power of God. &gt;&gt; We was all there. Right. &gt;&gt; Because we're seeing the quickening power of God now. We were all there. &gt;&gt; He said there was the dead saints represented in Moses. &gt;&gt; There was the resurrection and Jesus Christ glorified &gt;&gt; Elijah. Elijah. Moses. Elijah. Moses. Elijah and Jesus. All standing on the mountain. The dead saints. The rapture saints. And Jesus glorified. &gt;&gt; Amen. And there was Peter, James, and John representing those that were living. And hear his voice. He said, "When Peter and John and James saw Moses and Elijah, they recognized them on Mount Transfiguration. &gt;&gt; But it's a body. But when but then when that body a kind of a celestial body when it returns back to the earth it picks up the substance that it once lived in and then becomes a glorified body. And that body is the one that we'll see the Lord Jesus in in his resurrected body. &gt;&gt; Whoa. What powerful things &gt;&gt; I'm speaking it that we might believe it &gt;&gt; and we may not understand it but we say those are God's words &gt;&gt; vindicated and confirmed &gt;&gt; and I am I believe that &gt;&gt; and I shall participate in that &gt;&gt; and we are participating this morning &gt;&gt; in the message the resurrection of Jesus. He said, "Look at his eyes. No more filled with tears." He said, "They couldn't even uh they could even pierce like the sun in the middle of the day. No more nail scars in his feet. They were like brass." He's speaking about Revelation chapter 1. They were like brass tried in the fire. He was free from all of that. He was glorified and his hands wasn't scarred more. And he was in the midst of his churches a blessing. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He had indeed crossed over. He had come the whole distance. &gt;&gt; He'd come from the whole distance from his holiness. Can you even imagine just for a moment uh the the place of God where even saraphims just cry holy, holy, holy, holy &gt;&gt; and can scarcely approach to such a a being as that. And yet that God &gt;&gt; said, "I will cross over." &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Without blemish. I'll cross over. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. I'll come to a sinful world and be sinless. &gt;&gt; I will come and be born of a woman. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; The very God, I will stretch my tent &gt;&gt; further than no one can comprehend this. I'll stretch my tent. &gt;&gt; I'll let the life out of my being. &gt;&gt; I'll come down. I'll stretch my tent. I'll cross over. &gt;&gt; And because the blood cell in the first mother Eve because it was contaminated, &gt;&gt; hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Because it was contaminated and invaded, &gt;&gt; God came down. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; To finish and to complete it and to make it finish. Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; To destroy and to make to make it sound. The Bible tells us in John 19:30, "And when Jesus therefore had received the vinegar, he said, "It is finished." &gt;&gt; That's what blemish is without blemish. Blemish is to finish. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Has to be something that's finished. A lamb that's so complete has such integrity of being that it can finish the task that it was sent to do. The lamb that was laid there in its throat cut open couldn't finish it. It still left the man condemned. &gt;&gt; But this one crossed over. &gt;&gt; Came down to you. &gt;&gt; You're sitting here today, but this lamb I'm speaking of came to you. came to you in your sin, came to you in your darkness, came to you in your bondage, came to you in your sickness. He may be coming to you today because you're bound. You're you have fears, you have suspicions, you have bitterness, you have whatever more. He's here to come to you. &gt;&gt; I'm here to say he crossed over &gt;&gt; and said it is finished. &gt;&gt; I've completed this. I'm the lamb without blemish. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; I'm the lamb that can complete the job. &gt;&gt; I'm the lamb that can raise your body &gt;&gt; out of the grave. &gt;&gt; I'm the lamb that can give you healing today. &gt;&gt; If you can believe, all things are possible to them that believe. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; I felt so inspired. I felt that God wanted me to come here and call on this congregation and those that are streaming and all that will ever hear my voice. Whatever you do, believe on him. &gt;&gt; Believe his word. &gt;&gt; He is the lamb that came. There is nothing insufficient with him. He's complete. &gt;&gt; He finished the task. &gt;&gt; He finished it for you. &gt;&gt; He didn't need it. &gt;&gt; You needed it. &gt;&gt; And he came to you. You couldn't go to him. You couldn't cross over. You couldn't spam the chasm. He came to you. &gt;&gt; He is here coming to you this morning. &gt;&gt; You can believe it. &gt;&gt; There's not a devil in hell. There's not a demon of darkness. There isn't death itself. Greater is he that is in you as a believer. It's here. I don't care what kind of spirit &gt;&gt; has been on your trail &gt;&gt; and hounding you. &gt;&gt; You have you have perfect right to be free of him &gt;&gt; today. Let this not be another Sunday morning. Let this be the day. We don't care about a Sunday morning or what day it is. This is a day that the Lord hath made and we shall rejoice and be glad in it. Yes. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; He said, "It is finished." &gt;&gt; This was the lamb. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; That was without blemish. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. He crossed over from the portals of glory. He made himself of no reputation. Paul said in the Philippians, "And took upon him the form of a servant and was made in the likeness of men." Apostle Paul said in Romans 8:3, "For what the law could not do in that it was weak through the flesh, &gt;&gt; God sending his own son &gt;&gt; in the likeness of sinful flesh and for sin condemns sin in the flesh." &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. I tell you, sin is condemned. &gt;&gt; Sin's under the sentence of death &gt;&gt; and annihilation. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Isn't it wonderful to know that we'll have a we're going to live in a place without sin. &gt;&gt; Without temptation, &gt;&gt; without an evil thing, &gt;&gt; no wonder he said, "What a Mother's Day." &gt;&gt; It's going to be a time we're going to be gathered together. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And just one more time. Lord Phoenix, &gt;&gt; he said while I'm reading or speaking, he said while I'm reading or speaking, just remember the omnipresent God is always here present. &gt;&gt; And as a brother said about the epileptic of the last time we were here, God can heal cancer, parallelism, &gt;&gt; whatever it is, he has already done it. Amen. &gt;&gt; If he can just get you to believe that, &gt;&gt; there's nothing that's impossible today if he can just get us to believe that. &gt;&gt; He said, "You're not saved tonight. You've been saved. &gt;&gt; You were saved, 1900 years ago. &gt;&gt; And now he said, maybe tonight you'll accept that salvation, &gt;&gt; but it's already paid for. The debt has been cleared up. the devil that put you in the pawn shop. And that devil that put you in the pawn shop, Jesus came and redeemed you and opened up the doors. And the only thing you have to do is walk out &gt;&gt; and claim your liberty. &gt;&gt; That's all. You have a receipt from God &gt;&gt; that the debt is paid. Don't ever let anybody try to bring the the the consequence of that debt back on you. The debt has been paid. &gt;&gt; I'm going to glorify the cross. &gt;&gt; I'm going to glorify our lamb. &gt;&gt; And Jesus said in his last words, "It is finished." &gt;&gt; The prophet reconfirming it again, "It is finished." Every redemptive blessing was completely finished. &gt;&gt; When he said it is finished, that line in Exodus couldn't say it. &gt;&gt; But this one crossed over &gt;&gt; and he said it. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Don't walk out with the same things hanging on you. &gt;&gt; Don't walk out even with the same physical phys physical sicknesses or diseases. Let's leave them here. &gt;&gt; Let's take a hold of the receipt. And I don't care what the thing is. &gt;&gt; I don't care what it is. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. To [Applause] &gt;&gt; the devil's a liar. &gt;&gt; He's trying to impose sicknesses and diseases &gt;&gt; and sins and fears and complexes and all kinds of things on God's people. We're not of this world. Amen. &gt;&gt; That's of this world, but we're not of this world. &gt;&gt; We're in the world, but not of the world. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Now, I want to come to something that been difficult and I hope and I'm I've been have some trepidation within myself here just wondering if I can somehow make it as clear as it's it's stirring in my own heart. this lamb that crossed over and we read of it. It was our griefs, our sorrows, &gt;&gt; our infirmities, our the chastisement of our peace was upon him and with his stripes we are healed. He's despised. &gt;&gt; He's rejected. &gt;&gt; Amen. It was that was all ours &gt;&gt; that was laid on him &gt;&gt; and he took it our sickness in a grief and sorrows and trouble and wars and starvation and mental illness and the prophet said that in Eden when Eve fell and Adam then followed followed her all everything that we see every mental institution every every prison &gt;&gt; every every hospital bed. &gt;&gt; Go into the go into these senior citizens homes and see these poor people and and and see all of the uh uh mental conditions. And it is truly sad because it's all part of death. &gt;&gt; No wonder we're going to be restored to our youth &gt;&gt; once again. &gt;&gt; That is not a pipe dream. &gt;&gt; That's not a pie in the sky. That's a promise of God. &gt;&gt; And if that is not so, we are wasting our time. &gt;&gt; We should go out, eat, drink, and be merry, for tomorrow we die. But I say we, tomorrow we live. &gt;&gt; Receive the Lord Jesus Christ and thou shalt be saved. &gt;&gt; How soon, as early as you can understand that you children and young people, &gt;&gt; you want to be saved, you want to go to heaven. This might be meat and potatoes, but this is the truth. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Sicknesses and grief and sorrows. Galatians says, Paul speaks in Galatians, idolatry and witchcraft and hatred and variance and emulations and wrath and strath and strife and seditions and heresies, envyings and murders and drunkenness. We have so much of it that we become immune almost. We become numb to the whole thing. We hear it all the time and we can't even imagine a place without that. Heaven will have none of this. &gt;&gt; The kingdom that has been born in our hearts will have none of this. and drunkenness and rellings and the such like of which I tell you before tell you before as I have also told you in time past that they which do such things shall not inherit the kingdom of God. &gt;&gt; And he said in Romans for we know that the whole creation groanth and travaleth in pain together until now. And he said in Corinthians 1 Corinthians 6:11, "And such were some of you, &gt;&gt; but you are washed, &gt;&gt; but you are sanctified, &gt;&gt; but you are justified &gt;&gt; in the name of the Lord Jesus &gt;&gt; and by the spirit of our God." &gt;&gt; And such were some of you. I will say such were all of us. &gt;&gt; But you were washed. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Hallelujah. But you are sanctified. &gt;&gt; You're cleansed. &gt;&gt; Isn't this something worth rejoicing over? &gt;&gt; This isn't an NBA game. This isn't a hockey game. This is the game of life. &gt;&gt; And such were some of you. &gt;&gt; But you were washed. &gt;&gt; You are sanctified. &gt;&gt; You're cleansed &gt;&gt; by the blood of Jesus Christ. This lamb who crossed over &gt;&gt; and pitched his tent with us &gt;&gt; and felt everything that we failed and he was tempted in all points like you are. &gt;&gt; Don't have a pity story now. Don't have a pity party. He was tempted in all points &gt;&gt; like you are. &gt;&gt; Like I am. We all have a devil to fight and we all have a victory to win. And I'm preaching today that you might have victory in this service and go out and the rest of your life enjoy that. Enjoy that victory. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; If it's truth, &gt;&gt; God will vindicate it. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; And this is truth. &gt;&gt; I'm reading the prophet's words. &gt;&gt; It's truth. &gt;&gt; If it's a lie, it won't work. &gt;&gt; But I can tell you that it works. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. Yes sir. &gt;&gt; As individuals, &gt;&gt; we are often responsible for our own wounding and our own scars. &gt;&gt; Other times scars are brought upon us. Brought upon us by circumstances that are beyond our control. Right? &gt;&gt; And we do anything we could to get out of it. &gt;&gt; If we had to sit here and live with our past, no one survives. &gt;&gt; And such were some of you. &gt;&gt; But you are washed. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Such were some of you. You failed in the past, but you are washed. Amen. &gt;&gt; Glory to God. &gt;&gt; Glory to God. &gt;&gt; I tell you what, friends. I'm going to preach it. &gt;&gt; But such were some of you. &gt;&gt; But you are washed. &gt;&gt; You failed. Yes, we all failed, but you are washed. &gt;&gt; You have sinned. We all sinned, but you are washed. &gt;&gt; You might be a good sinner or a sophisticated sinner or a rotten sinner, but we're all sinners. &gt;&gt; But you are washed. when you are sanctified. [Applause] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. [Music] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Someone might be inclined to say, "Well, uh, I didn't experience those things." And I'm, "What does that do? I didn't experience those things. I was brought up in a good home, brought up in a Christian home, taught by the covenants of the word of God. I've lived clean and so on so forth." What does that do for you? I can tell you what. And you listen to me real close. That won't even open the G doors of heaven. Yeah. &gt;&gt; A fraction of an inch. &gt;&gt; So, well then what does it do for me? It makes your life down here better. &gt;&gt; You might have an easier life down here. If you don't have to have those things plague your mind, it has nothing to do with eternal life. &gt;&gt; By the law, no one is saved. &gt;&gt; By the law, no one is justified. By the works of the flesh, no one is justified. &gt;&gt; In fact, this brother Brandham says it very clear. He says, now reading out of Hebrews, now go on unto perfection. &gt;&gt; Jesus said, be therefore perfect as your father in heaven is perfect. And everyone, he says, and we're everyone. We are, he's including himself. We, William Brham, and you. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We're everyone condemned. &gt;&gt; True. No matter what we ever do, we're condemned. &gt;&gt; We were born condemned. &gt;&gt; You remember when you were born? No, you don't remember when you were born. But the prophet said, "You were born condemned. &gt;&gt; We were born condemned." Your mama and papa was condemned. &gt;&gt; All condemned. &gt;&gt; All your ancestors were condemned. &gt;&gt; And was born in sin. &gt;&gt; All your ancestors born in sin. How are you going to rate anything? &gt;&gt; We're all sinners &gt;&gt; and shaped in iniquity. So, how are you ever going to get it? &gt;&gt; How are you going to be perfect? &gt;&gt; If you never done a thing, never stole, never lied, never done anything in your life, you're still condemned. &gt;&gt; You never been a bad person. You're condemned. &gt;&gt; How you going to get it? How you going to be perfect? Someone from perfection had to cross over. and pitch his tent next door to you. [Music] [Applause] &gt;&gt; You were condemned before you breathed your first breath. &gt;&gt; Now, somebody stand up and say, "I'm okay." &gt;&gt; Now, someone in the face of these words say, "Well, I'm, you know, I'm a little more sanctimonious." You're condemned. Before you breathed your first breath, you're condemned. your mama, your papa, your ancestors. We're all born in sin shape iniquities. We come here as sinners &gt;&gt; and there's no degree of sinners. We're all sinners, &gt;&gt; but you are washed. &gt;&gt; That was some of you, but you were washed. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; He said you were judged of God before you breathed your first breath. You were judged by the sexual desire of your father and mother who through their act brought you here on the earth and God condemned it in the beginning. &gt;&gt; How can we how can we come here sinless when we're the very act that brought us here &gt;&gt; was not God's perfect plan &gt;&gt; and you're condemned to start with. He said so every other person on the earth was condemned with you. Now, where are you going to get perfection? &gt;&gt; I kind of stepped ahead of myself to bring that in. &gt;&gt; Now, when we see, let me turn your focus and attention onto Christ, the perfect, spotless, &gt;&gt; sinless, &gt;&gt; son of God. And we could say as the prophet said, I was there. &gt;&gt; I died with him. &gt;&gt; But when you see his m and he talks about the masterpiece and here's the phrase in the masterpiece I have two different places. His brother Brandham says to me the masterpiece what made it the masterpiece was the stroke &gt;&gt; the mar &gt;&gt; that caused the flaw. that made it the masterpiece taking it from the from the uh uh Michelangelo's statue of of Moses and and he said when he saw in front of him what had been in his mind all of these times and he toiled all of these years and finally it was so perfect the image of his mind now put it in the spiritual what God had in his mind God had in his mind I'll cross over. I I will not lose my family. I will not lose my children. I will cross over this chasm and I'll pitch my tent with them. [Applause] &gt;&gt; I'll go the whole distance. &gt;&gt; That lamb couldn't do it. Abraham sacrificed and he brought he he brought Isaac to the mountain and raised his hand with a knife to bring it down which was a type of Christ. &gt;&gt; But that boy couldn't be bruised cuz he was born in sin. &gt;&gt; He couldn't be a sacrifice. &gt;&gt; No lambs could be a sacrifice. &gt;&gt; Even Isaac couldn't be a sacrifice. Yeah. &gt;&gt; And all through the scripture they sacrificed, &gt;&gt; but there was no redemption. &gt;&gt; But now we see one. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; And here he is. &gt;&gt; Here is the son of God. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; He's crossed over the whole distance. &gt;&gt; And so we say by faith, I'm identified in him. &gt;&gt; And there's a twofold thing here I want to get across. And I can say I'm also identified in the mar. &gt;&gt; Yes. Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Glory. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I'm identified in the wound. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; That was there because I'm here. &gt;&gt; That wound was there when God smoked him and he was smitten of God. &gt;&gt; God smoked him. Yes. In this case, God allowed man to do it. &gt;&gt; God allowed man to do it. As I said, he allowed even Satan in the beginning. He allowed he allowed it to happen in Eden. Now he allowed the Roman soldiers and he allowed the the Jewish leadership and the scripture tells us and and even today in the world that you live in. This has been the ongoing argument for all of these centuries. The Vatican and Rome says the Jews killed him and the Jews said you killed him. &gt;&gt; It wasn't neither of them. God took his life. Jesus said, "No man, no man, no man, do you hear me? No man takes my life from me. I lay it down &gt;&gt; and I will take it up again." &gt;&gt; That, my friend, is crossing over. &gt;&gt; That's going the whole distance. &gt;&gt; And there isn't a man, woman, or a child in the sound of my voice. But what needed that to happen? And if he came over for the best person, he came over for the worst person. He came over for the prostitutes and the harlots. He came over for the drug addict, drug addicts, and all of the He came over for the weak and the strong. He came over for the good and those that live religious. He came over for you and he came over for everyone. &gt;&gt; And we're all in the same basket. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen. &gt;&gt; In fact is it's not going to be the drunkard that's going to be surprised &gt;&gt; cuz he knows where he's going. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It's going to be those that think I'm going to heaven. &gt;&gt; I'm going to heaven because I did this, because I did that, &gt;&gt; because I did all these different works. &gt;&gt; They're the ones going to be disappointed. &gt;&gt; That's true. Brother Brandham says those, he doesn't say those that are in the bars are going to be shocked when they find out the rapture happened. &gt;&gt; No, it's going to be those that come to church. [Music] &gt;&gt; Don't you, I say this with all the fear in my heart. Don't you dare &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; come back to this church after the rapture happened. You make sure that you've gone also. &gt;&gt; You make sure you've changed. Why? Because he paid the price. &gt;&gt; Why would you miss such a gift? Why would you miss eternal bless? Why would you miss the rapture when it's been paid and we have the receive? It's already paid. &gt;&gt; Why risk it? [Music] &gt;&gt; Don't ever do that. Don't risk it. Don't lose it. Don't hang on to some little &gt;&gt; thing that seems so precious and a treasure to you and it's worthless. &gt;&gt; It's a piece of glass. It's not a diamond. It's a piece of glass. &gt;&gt; Don't hang on to some false hope. &gt;&gt; Just cast yourself completely. You know this is the truth. Amen. [Music] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; The masterpiece family was marred in Eden. And the prophet said that Satan came and crawled under the walls. They were protected by the word. And I must I don't want to take too much time. I'm seeking to watch it closely as we have the service tonight. But the dreadful effects, it was the dreadful effects of sin that brought the bruising and the wounding and the and the mar. &gt;&gt; So I I now this is what I want you to see. I'm coming right to the heart of it now. You say I'm identified in Christ and I'm I'm identified in the bruising. I'm identified in the mar. And this has always perplexed me. I've spoke on it a number of times, but I never came to this point yet. But brother Brandham said that the mar is what made it the masterpiece. I had to translate that and bring that on down because the mar represents I won't talk about you. I'll talk about me but you can take you can join me. It talks about our iniquity &gt;&gt; my failures &gt;&gt; our sin. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. our unbelief. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Our criticism, &gt;&gt; everything that you can think, all the wars and all the starvation and all the things that happened, it just it's so magnified today. And I have to bring it down. But this is this was when I see the mar say that was my &gt;&gt; iniquities and my failures &gt;&gt; past and present and any that may be in the future. &gt;&gt; That's true. &gt;&gt; He was marred for me. Amen. &gt;&gt; And now a prophet comes and and and simply staggers our mental faculties by saying that stroke made it the masterpiece. &gt;&gt; Amen. And so I had to reduce it down and say how was it that our failings, our iniquities, &gt;&gt; our sins, how could that contribute to make him the masterpiece? And I've been pondering this very, very deeply and I'll tell you what I've can come to a conclusion. without what caused the flaw. We We caused the flaw. &gt;&gt; You agree with that? &gt;&gt; We caused the flaw, &gt;&gt; but it was the flaw that gave access to the attributes &gt;&gt; of Claw. &gt;&gt; Think about it now. The flaw &gt;&gt; gave access to the attributes because in the flaw was me or you as a sinner. But in the flaw then I could draw on the attributes of forgiveness. &gt;&gt; In the flaw was the sicknesses and diseases of the people. And in the flaw we could draw on the attributes of a healer. &gt;&gt; And the healer made him great. The healer made him. The forgiver, the savior made him great. And God God smold him &gt;&gt; so that out from God could come the attributes of God. Who could think of the long sufferings of God? &gt;&gt; Who could imagine his longsuffering? &gt;&gt; Who could imagine that kind of love? &gt;&gt; Someone who cursed and someone who damned God. Someone who hated Christ. And yet his love was greater than the hatred. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. and his love because he's a predestinated son and daughter of God living in his darkness living in this not only the slime pits but the swine pit &gt;&gt; are you with me &gt;&gt; and I have to bring something here &gt;&gt; and this is probably even more sensitive and more dangerous amongst believers. But the message has made us the message has has brought forth a super race has actually brought forth a a very very high standard of living people. People who live by a very high standard. &gt;&gt; But when if that should just become like a second nature to us and just we automatically do we we we do this. We wear our dresses a certain way. We wear our hair a certain way. We conduct ourselves a certain way. our homes are certain way because that's what we and that finally develops into a tradition. &gt;&gt; That tradition can become very dangerous &gt;&gt; because it's not something from the heart. It's not something alive. It's not vibrant. It's not the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; It's just something we learned. &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham said the priest and he had the priest. The priest was a good man. You couldn't even put your hand on it. couldn't lay a finger on his life and the woman at the well. And he's likening both of them to the same paragraph. He said the priest learned that the word of God was right. He learned that righteousness was correct. He learned that those things were right. And that's why he did it. But he said he had no representation. But the woman, she was lost. Had five husbands and living with the one now was not her husband. But she knew one thing. He said one thing. When the Messiah comes, [Applause] He will tell us all things. &gt;&gt; And she didn't need sermon. She didn't need a church to go to. As soon as he said it, she believed it. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; The flaw. &gt;&gt; I'm identified. You're identified in the flaw. And it gave access to the attributes of God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Part of the flaw was I personally had such confusion about the word of God. My confusion was in that flaw. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Because I was in darkness. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; And many of you in some church and some religion And it's a dead religion. I marvel how the prophet of God spoke so harshly against denominationalism. Do you know why? Because denominationalism is not is not based on truth. &gt;&gt; It's based on a lie. &gt;&gt; And it has people believing in a multiplicity of gods, three gods, two gods, whatever more. Baptism, afraid of the name of Jesus Christ. What a darkness that is. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; True. &gt;&gt; I'm not here to be critical. I'm not here to be facicious. But every time I see you, &gt;&gt; God the Father, God the Son, and God the Holy Ghost, I say, "Which God are you talking about? &gt;&gt; Who is your God? &gt;&gt; Are you afraid of his name? Jesus Christ." &gt;&gt; In the name Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; Of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Ghost. and his name is the Lord Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; We love that name. &gt;&gt; But my ignorance and my darkness and my confusion was in that flaw. &gt;&gt; And how I thank God for his patience. &gt;&gt; How I thank God for his attribute of revelation. &gt;&gt; Did you need revelation? [Music] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. If you haven't received it yet, don't stop at nothing &gt;&gt; till you have it as a living revelation within you. &gt;&gt; See yourself in the flaw. &gt;&gt; The flaw is yours. &gt;&gt; But the flaw made him greater. &gt;&gt; And when God saw that perfect lamb of God who had crossed over, &gt;&gt; he stro smoked him. &gt;&gt; Why? Because he had to die to go the full distance. Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; He had to go further in dying. He went to hell &gt;&gt; where you and I were destined to go. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And he emptied it out before you even got there. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; He emptied out paradise. &gt;&gt; Glory to God. &gt;&gt; Why did this masterpiece message have to be preached in this time? because he was made known &gt;&gt; in perfection. &gt;&gt; This message in the revelation of this message is a perfect revelation of the word of God. &gt;&gt; Now, I want you to believe that one. &gt;&gt; It may not You may not have a perfect understanding, but this message is a perfect revelation. There will not be another one. &gt;&gt; There's not another messenger. &gt;&gt; Excuse me raising my voice, but I want to get it through to you. There's not another messenger coming. &gt;&gt; There's not an eighth one. &gt;&gt; The seventh one, the last one. The others were reformers. This one was a prophet. &gt;&gt; There's nothing more coming. &gt;&gt; Settle it in your mind. There's nothing more coming. &gt;&gt; This is it. [Music] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. But once you see yourself, I'm not so worried about the bad people, people who live with big problems. I I've counseledled much of my life. You listening? And almost all of them, 99.9% in fact is is that they have a problem. They have a weakness. They have a prevailing unbelief or sin or something that they've done or something they're tempted, some temptation or something and we seek to bring them. I don't recall anyone ever coming to me and saying, "Brother Ed, my problem is I'm just too good. I'm just too good. And being so good, I don't feel a need. Being so good, I don't I don't feel conviction. I've been a good boy. I've been a good man. I've been a good father. I've been I've been a good wife, been a good mother, I've been a good young lady. I've just been too good, but I'm still missing something. That's the most dangerous spot. &gt;&gt; I'm a good believer. I'm a good church member. &gt;&gt; I'm there all the time. I pay my tithes. &gt;&gt; I do what I'm supposed to do. It's just like clockwork. &gt;&gt; I do I I live by the message of the best I know how to do. No, &gt;&gt; that's the danger spot. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; This morning, I want the good people to look at that terrible wounding and have and find where find where where the prophet of God describes his suffering. &gt;&gt; Yes. how he was brutalized and spit hanging on his beard and his ribs sticking out and a mass he said just a mass of bloody flesh. &gt;&gt; And then you say to yourself, that's because of me. &gt;&gt; I did that. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I did that. &gt;&gt; And you won't feel very righteous. But when you say because because I'm identified in that mar &gt;&gt; hallelujah &gt;&gt; I have access &gt;&gt; I'm so glad you've been patient. &gt;&gt; So glad you found me as they sang today. So glad you found me. So glad you drew me. So glad you wooed. So glad that you kept speaking. Even when I didn't make a move, you kept speaking. You kept speaking. So glad you kept drawing me. Oh God. &gt;&gt; So glad. &gt;&gt; So glad you're longsuffering. &gt;&gt; So glad you didn't give up. [Applause] &gt;&gt; So glad you stayed there. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It was Jesus who walked with the good people. And Jesus said to the good people, Jesus said to the believers, "Oh fools &gt;&gt; and slow of heart to believe all that the prophets have spoken." &gt;&gt; What to God suggested? Perhaps I should have just gone to my glory and forgotten all of this. &gt;&gt; But he stayed with them. He was determined. &gt;&gt; Perhaps two young men like you young fellows here, full of zeal, hung in there, stayed at the cross, was so disappointed in all that happened, but they thought the whole message had fallen apart. I can tell you the message hasn't fallen apart. [Music] &gt;&gt; The message is strong. The message is a pure vindicated word of God. I don't care what you see. I don't care where you where you look. But the word of God is absolutely flawless. [Music] &gt;&gt; This message came to make Christ known to you. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; This a flawless word. &gt;&gt; I hear people say message the message is a mess. I deny that. The message is the spotless bride of Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; And the prophet of God has said if you believe the prophet of God that he's raised himself up another masterpiece. &gt;&gt; And if he the man was a masterpiece, she the woman must also be the masterpiece. &gt;&gt; She is a masterpiece. Yes, he is. &gt;&gt; Just turn aside from all the negative things that you may see &gt;&gt; or you may come in contact with. Just turn it aside. Say it has no part of me. flaw gave access to his attributes. &gt;&gt; We were identified with him in the flaw. A part of our life caused the flaw and the flaw made him the masterpiece. &gt;&gt; Amen. How would you like this attribute? There is therefore now &gt;&gt; no &gt;&gt; condemnation &gt;&gt; to them which are in Christ Jesus. &gt;&gt; How can you have any condemnation in Christ Jesus? There is none in him. [Music] &gt;&gt; There is therefore say amen. Now, &gt;&gt; amen. No condemnation to them which are in Christ Jesus, who walk not after the spirit, who walk not after the flesh, but after the spirit. &gt;&gt; You're here because you're walking after the spirit. That's why you're here. &gt;&gt; You're not here just to hear some good things or some nice things. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Now, here's some things. I decided I would say some things to you and quote some things which are well known to you but I want you to think them and digest them together with me. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You know what the blood now we're talking about the mar and we're talking about the attribute as we saw the mar I'm identified with the mar. I don't have any problem identifying with Jesus Christ, the the crucified one, the perfect one, the spotless lamb of God. &gt;&gt; Don't have any trouble identifying. But then when I see the mar and see the spear &gt;&gt; and see the blood and water coming out &gt;&gt; and saying, Edis, you did that. &gt;&gt; You did that. You're part of that. &gt;&gt; He died for you. &gt;&gt; You have to say that. You &gt;&gt; if you're not identified with the mar, you're not identified with the attributes that came as a result of it. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; He said, you know what the blood of Christ does &gt;&gt; now? If he had if there hadn't been a mar, there wouldn't be any blood. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; So my mar, your mar, &gt;&gt; our part in the flaw brought forth the blood. Amen. &gt;&gt; And here's what we say about the blood. Here's what a prophet says about the blood. Do you know what the blood of Christ does to confess sin? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Could you imagine having a wash tub full of bleach &gt;&gt; and a little eyropper &gt;&gt; full of ink &gt;&gt; and you drop it this ink down into the wash tub? You've heard it before. But now I don't want you just to hear it. I want you to walk with it. I want you to digest it word by word and line by line. And you you drop the drop of ink in in the wash tub full of bleach. What happens to the ink? That's the question. &gt;&gt; What happens to the ink? &gt;&gt; My ink caused the flaw. &gt;&gt; My ink, your ink caused the flaw. What happens to the ink when you confess it? When you look upon him and say, "That was me. I am the sinner. &gt;&gt; I recognize you as a lamb of God. I confess my sin. I don't want to have any more to do with this life." &gt;&gt; When he said the ink becomes bleach, &gt;&gt; how can my ink become bleach? &gt;&gt; We don't understand the power of the attribute. The attribute crossed the whole distance. &gt;&gt; I could say it, but I'll read it. &gt;&gt; He asked, "What happened?" &gt;&gt; He said, "It doesn't hurt the bleach a bit." &gt;&gt; When the ink hit the bleach, when your sin hit the bleach, when your when your sin hit the blood, it didn't hurt the blood at all. &gt;&gt; What happened? [Applause] The blood didn't go into shock waves. &gt;&gt; The blood didn't go into some kind of spasm. &gt;&gt; The blood was made to take care of it. [Music] &gt;&gt; It doesn't hurt the bleach a bit. It just takes on and becomes bleach. &gt;&gt; What is the bleach? &gt;&gt; Righteousness. You say, "Explain that." I can't explain that. &gt;&gt; You can't explain that. That's what God's word is saying to you. &gt;&gt; And he says it becomes bleach. And that's what confessed sin does. When it's confessed upon the blood of Jesus Christ, it changes its color and becomes righteousness. [Applause] [Music] You'll never you'll never be able to explain that. &gt;&gt; You better just believe it. &gt;&gt; Otherwise, if you leave it hanging out here, Satan's got something to come and work on. &gt;&gt; It's not finished. It's not done. And to come and say, "Remember that." And you have a right to say, "I can't remember it. God can't remember it." And furthermore, it can't even be found. It cannot be found. And if you can find it, you're an instrument of Satan because you become part of the accusers's plan. I'll have nothing to do with the accuser. It can't be found. [Applause] God can't find it. [Applause] [Music] Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; If you see something different, you got a prophet to deal with. &gt;&gt; If you got a feeling that's adverse to this, &gt;&gt; you're in a dangerous spot. &gt;&gt; And that's not just one time. That's not just one quote. He says that in the message look &gt;&gt; and I'd like you to look. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; He says that one drop of ink &gt;&gt; can sign your death warrant. &gt;&gt; It can send you to the electric chair. &gt;&gt; Or that one drop of ink can pardon you from your sins. &gt;&gt; It was sent here for a purpose &gt;&gt; and we got to use it for the right thing. But for instance, it's finished. &gt;&gt; And we drop that one drop of ink into a tub of bleach. &gt;&gt; What happens to it? &gt;&gt; You don't see nothing happen. &gt;&gt; You don't see anything happen. You can't decipher and determine and analyze what's happening. &gt;&gt; But it he says what and you see nothing happen. But there's no more color. &gt;&gt; It was black ink, but now there's no more color. He's taking it from a different side. There's no more color. The color breaks up. &gt;&gt; The sin breaks up. &gt;&gt; The iniquity breaks up. &gt;&gt; Everything that caused the mar breaks up. [Applause] &gt;&gt; And you don't know where it went. [Applause] &gt;&gt; You ask me why I'm happy. &gt;&gt; So I'll just tell you why. &gt;&gt; My sins are gone. They're buried in the sea of God's forgetfulness. &gt;&gt; He can't remember them. The very mind of God who conceived my being here can't remember it. &gt;&gt; That is beyond our understanding. &gt;&gt; That God can forget it. &gt;&gt; God can decree to forget it. &gt;&gt; He has decreed to forget it. Amen. &gt;&gt; And I've had people who have whimpered and cried and and and pleaded with God over their failures and over their sin and over their past and all of these things. And when they heard when they heard there was one sister and she lived for years years under condemnation &gt;&gt; and she was sad and she'd go into very terrible fits of depression. And furthermore, this surprised her. She lived in our home with us and she would go into those and they would last for several days. And finally one day my wife just said to her even just talking to that spirit that spirit wanted to bring others down with it. &gt;&gt; I'm in a pout and I want everybody else to be in a pout. I've lost the victory and I want a whole bunch of people to sympathize with me. I'm going to make this home as miserable as I can. &gt;&gt; That's a devil. &gt;&gt; Don't you dare give in to that devil. &gt;&gt; And if he can bring an accusation against you, that's exactly what he wants to do. &gt;&gt; He wants to bring you down. &gt;&gt; And so said to this one one person, she said, "Begin to relate all the things." And said, "No, there's no use talking to God about it because he can't remember it. Right? &gt;&gt; No use going in prayer saying, "God, I did this and God, I did that." &gt;&gt; That's not the question. God wants to say, "Did you confess it?" &gt;&gt; You confessed it. I can't remember it. &gt;&gt; It doesn't exist. In fact, it doesn't exist. &gt;&gt; How does it become righteous? If you let God deal with it the way it should be dealt with, you'll be a better person for the kingdom of God. It'll turn that thing into righteousness. &gt;&gt; How else you going to make that? It'll turn it into righteousness. &gt;&gt; Do you hear me? It'll turn it into righteousness. &gt;&gt; You'll be a different person, a different man, a different woman. [Applause] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. I'm going to say things I've never said before. I had there's been a lot of people that have moved in here to the church over the many, many years and been blessed and very dear friends, wonderful, wonderful families, wonderful individuals. I had a pastor call me many years ago and said these people this that this that the other thing this that and related off a whole horror story and said and he said I will send you an airplane ticket so you can fly down here so I can tell you what these people are like. I thanked him but refused it. And I can tell you those people are some of the finest believers you could ever see in this world. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Why would a minister even want to talk about &gt;&gt; things that have things that went into the tub of bleach? &gt;&gt; Didn't go into the tub of bleach, but went into this perfect lamb of God. &gt;&gt; And the blood that came out of his body and the sin that fell into that can't be found anymore. And it broke up its collar. It broke up. It's it's chemistry. It broke it up completely and became righteousness. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Yes, Lord. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. The &gt;&gt; Bible says, "None are righteous, know not one." &gt;&gt; None are righteous. &gt;&gt; Now, to be a Christian, I'm coming to a close. Now to be a Christian, you have to be the same. All that he was. &gt;&gt; I'm identified. &gt;&gt; I'm identified with the flaw, but I'm also identified with the blood. &gt;&gt; I'm identified with the bleach. &gt;&gt; And all of my past went to the bleach. &gt;&gt; All of your past went to the bleach. And God help you if it hasn't gone to the bleach. What do I need to do, brother Bisco? What do I need to do? just confess it. &gt;&gt; You know how big a problem that is? Brother Brandham has people in front of him and he says, "Do you believe?" &gt;&gt; And they say, "Yes, I do." And you know what his next words are? God bless you. [Music] &gt;&gt; You'll never hear him once say, "Well, I don't know about that." &gt;&gt; Are you sure? Are you sure you've confessed it? &gt;&gt; Are you sure? You'll never hear him say that. Find me the quote. &gt;&gt; He'll say, "God bless you." &gt;&gt; You're blessed of God. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen. &gt;&gt; And he says now to be a true Christian all that he was. I'm identified with him. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And he is in me. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; The congregation should say, "Thanks be to God. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. He is in me. &gt;&gt; The marred one. &gt;&gt; The one that the lamb in Exodus couldn't do. &gt;&gt; Isaac couldn't do it. &gt;&gt; This one crossed over. The almighty divine one came down &gt;&gt; and found me. &gt;&gt; And when he came personally to me, I could say, "Forgive me. &gt;&gt; I'm sorry. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; I hate this thing about me. &gt;&gt; I hate this weakness. &gt;&gt; This iniquity, &gt;&gt; this temptation, all of this weakness, this I don't want it. Remove it from me. &gt;&gt; When you confess it, it dropped &gt;&gt; into the bleach. &gt;&gt; If we don't have that, I don't have that quote. If I don't have that quote, I don't have a message. If we don't have a message, I'm done with the ministry. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; This is a message of power. &gt;&gt; This is a message of hope. &gt;&gt; This is a message of faith. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. This is a message. This is the resurrection message. [Applause] &gt;&gt; I'm beyond playing church, friends. &gt;&gt; I'm beyond playing games. Anybody doesn't want this word, I say, have a happy tribulation. cuz you certainly will be in a tribulation. [Applause] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. I'm having a hard time slowing down. &gt;&gt; He's in me &gt;&gt; and I'm in him. &gt;&gt; Then every Christian that's a real genuine Christian was with him. &gt;&gt; When the morning stars sang together, &gt;&gt; were you there? &gt;&gt; I was in him when the morning stars sang together. And when the sons of God shouted for joy, and that's why I'm still shouting for joy, &gt;&gt; I did it then, I do it now. And I do it now, and I'll do it again. Hallelujah. We'll rejoice together. And the sons of God and daughters of God shouted for joy. [Music] Hallelujah. Glory, brother Peter. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Before there was a foundation of the world, &gt;&gt; we were identified in the immortal realms and God 10 million years before the world was ever formed. &gt;&gt; If I've got eternal life, I was with him there. I was with Joseph when he was rejected &gt;&gt; of his brothers because he was spiritual and the rest of them was carnal. I was with him when he knew the reproach to stand by his own brothers. What's he saying? I was in the flaw. &gt;&gt; I'm identified with the rejection. &gt;&gt; I'm identified when he was despised. [Applause] [Music] &gt;&gt; What he was, I am. And what I am, he was. I was with Jacob that night that he wrestled all night. Jacob the shyster. Jacob the cheater. Jacob, I was with him and he wrestled all night with the angel. I've wrestled myself. &gt;&gt; I know what he spent went through. So I wrestled with Jacob the same time he did for I'm his brother. &gt;&gt; I was with Moses when he went down into Egypt. I was with Moses at the burning bush. If you're a Christian, you're identified with the Bible characters. And don't forget it. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; You're at the burning bush. Don't forget it. &gt;&gt; You're with Jacob wrestling with the angel. Why? Because you wrestled with the same angel. [Applause] I was with Daniel &gt;&gt; in the lion's den. &gt;&gt; I was with the Hebrew children in the fiery furnace &gt;&gt; when the fire couldn't burn them because of the presence of the fourth man of the lion. &gt;&gt; Why can you write a song? You were there. &gt;&gt; They wouldn't bend. They wouldn't bow. They wouldn't burn. You won't bend. You have not bowed and you shall not burn. [Applause] Because I was in the flaw, I'll be where he is on the throne. &gt;&gt; You'll be with me &gt;&gt; in my father's house. [Applause] &gt;&gt; I most surely &gt;&gt; was with him at Calvary. [Applause] I must be identified with him at Calvary, I must be there to a place &gt;&gt; that where not also I was identified with him at Calvary, I died with him at Calvary. &gt;&gt; Every Christian must die with him at Calvary. &gt;&gt; If you don't die with him at Calvary, you can't be none of his. &gt;&gt; I was there when he died and I died with him. &gt;&gt; You did. &gt;&gt; Is this just a word? Is this just a theory? Is this a reality? &gt;&gt; I died with him. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; In him. You died for your sins. &gt;&gt; He died for you. &gt;&gt; You were in him. &gt;&gt; G. &gt;&gt; And then I was with him &gt;&gt; when he raised up from the dead. &gt;&gt; I came up on Easter morning with him &gt;&gt; in the resurrection. &gt;&gt; Whatever he did, I was right there with him. Every believer was with him. I tell you what, friends, I'm leaving this here. I was with him when he stood as a platform &gt;&gt; and spoke through his own servant. I was with him when the prophet God spoke. &gt;&gt; I was standing with brother Brandham when he spoke because I believe those words. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And what he is, I am. &gt;&gt; I am. &gt;&gt; And what I am, he is. &gt;&gt; We partaken of his grace. &gt;&gt; Of his forgiveness, of his longsuffering, of his mercies [Applause] &gt;&gt; and new every day. &gt;&gt; Don't forget this service. When you leave this place and if anything comes haunting you and tries to say something different to you, you say, "Get behind me, Satan. Go back to the pit. &gt;&gt; My life stands before God, &gt;&gt; whiter than the driven snow." &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; What does this do? Not to make you feel good, to glorify Calvary, &gt;&gt; to make the cross greater, &gt;&gt; to make his suffering greater, &gt;&gt; because through his wound came the attribute &gt;&gt; and turn my sin &gt;&gt; to righteousness. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Jesus. &gt;&gt; You'll never hear that &gt;&gt; in any denominational church. &gt;&gt; That's right. You'll never hear such words of power &gt;&gt; as spoken by this messenger. &gt;&gt; You'll never hear &gt;&gt; that your sin was ink and dropped into a tub of bleach and lost its color and lost its entire makeup and lost its chemistry and lost everything and cannot be found by almighty God. You'll never find it again. [Applause] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. [Music] And I close with this. If you become inspired to find something that already has been completely annihilated in the precious blood, whether it's your own faults, your own weaknesses, your own failures, your own sin or iniquity, whatever I call it that because that's what Satan would like to call it. Or if you find it in yourself or you find it in someone else or you find it in your husband or your wife, you're in dangerous ground. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; You find it in a brother or you find it in a sister. &gt;&gt; Say, "What business is that?" None of our business between them and God. &gt;&gt; And you know what the prophet will say? Pray for them. Pray for them. What would happen if this whole church began to pray for people? Pray for that brother. Pray for that sister. &gt;&gt; You think they had a telephone hook up there and said, "You know what? This this blah blah blah all this thing that is absolutely absolutely outside of the realm of God. &gt;&gt; All God knows about is I stretched my tent. &gt;&gt; I came the whole distance. I came without blemish. I crossed over &gt;&gt; the whole distance." &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen. &gt;&gt; He crossed over the whole distance. &gt;&gt; He reached even to you. &gt;&gt; Isn't it wonderful? &gt;&gt; He crossed over. [Music] &gt;&gt; Even to you. [Applause] &gt;&gt; There's a wonderful &gt;&gt; I tell you what, friends. I'm having a revival. &gt;&gt; He crossed over. Glory to God. &gt;&gt; And you know what he said? It is finished. &gt;&gt; It's done. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. It's done. &gt;&gt; And the prophet of God even went further. He said, "It's gone. It's gone. It's gone. Never to come back." Glory to God. Glory to God. [Applause] [Applause] [Applause] I'm amazed. Oh, I'm amazed that he cared. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. [Applause] You want to sing, &gt;&gt; you want to rejoice, let's say, thank you, Lord Jesus. &gt;&gt; Thank you, oh God. [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] &gt;&gt; Glory, glory, hallelujah, hallelujah. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Oh, thank you. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord Jesus. [Music] [Applause] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. [Applause] Hallelujah. Thank you Lord Jesus. Hallelujah Lord. [Music] &gt;&gt; I'm amazed. Let's sing it. I'm amazed that he loved me. &gt;&gt; Glory.

Some that still need to be awakened. &gt;&gt; All things are possible &gt;&gt; to them that believe. &gt;&gt; I call on mothers to believe. &gt;&gt; I call on fathers to believe. that at that gathering the circle shall not be broken. &gt;&gt; I refuse to give the enemy &gt;&gt; any I refuse to give him a thought a space in my mind. &gt;&gt; We claim them. &gt;&gt; We claim them. &gt;&gt; We claim them &gt;&gt; in the name of Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; And we have a right to claim him. The sacrifice &gt;&gt; crossed over &gt;&gt; came down &gt;&gt; to where we are &gt;&gt; when we've been there. Right. [Music] God praise and when we were going to sing in a moment, praise God.

Amen. God bless you. Why &gt;&gt; don't you turn around, shake hands with some redeemed. If we cross over this afternoon, might be a few million years before you get to shake their hand again. God bless you. You're dismissed in Jesus name. Our brother Tom is speaking this evening. So come and God bless you, Sister Sally Daw. Take greetings and love to brother Edwin for us. Amen. Amen.
