Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Thank you Lord Jesus. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. I'm going to ask our brother Roy Floren. Brother Roy, if you'd come and open the service in a word of prayer. Got a couple of requests here we want to remember this morning. this request for uh to pray for a family in Croatia, longtime wonderful believers with two young girls and uh just desiring our prayer asking uh for God's perfect will in lives especially in an employment opportunity. Brother Milco's requesting prayer for his wife Johanna arthritis. We want to remember brother Dods still in the hospital and the Lord would raise him up. Amen. give him complete healing. And we want to pray as well this morning for brother Gregory from the Czech Republic. He's brother Zalish's son-in-law. He's in his 40s, has three children. He was operated on for cancer, but the cancer is now spread to other parts of his body. They've asked that we would join with them and pray this morning. Amen. If you have a need this morning is lifted before the Lord as you go to prayer, if you're listening in on the internet, and we've got a God who hears, knows exactly what your need is. So let's join together with these requests. Amen. Brother Roy, if you come, [Music] let us bow our heads. A gracious, loving heavenly father, we count it a privilege once again, Father, to have this opportunity to bow in thy divine and holy presence this morning. Father, we've come here with our leaks of fire to lift up the living God. The one, oh God, who predestinated us before the foundation of the world to be your sons and daughters. [Music] Today we are reminded, oh God, of millions and billions of peoples around the world who are before a television worshiping the gods of sports and entertainment. But here we are as your family, Lord, to worship the God that we love, the one, oh God, who saved us by his grace this morning. And as we've sung the songs of Zion, Lord, that precious fountain, that blood that drew from Emmanuel's vein this morning, that blood, oh God, that rose this Old Testament saints, Father, and today we believe that same blood is here to cleanse us from every sin, Lord. We believe that fountain is still alive in our day this morning, Father. And today, Lord, we just lift ourselves, oh God, out of the way. And let that fountain cleanse us and wash us and purge us from every sin this morning. Oh God, Lord, &gt;&gt; today, oh God, we just want to bring this request that has been read before you, that family in Croatia, Father, we ask you, oh God, that you will just reach in a very special way, oh God, and let your your touch bring them, oh God, that answer the need for their need this morning, Father. We bring Sister Johanna before you, oh God, and asking that you would just touch her, Lord. We pray oh God that divine healing touch of God will reach down and just deliver her from this demon of arthritis this morning oh God and bring total and complete deliverance to her. Father we pray for brother Dods oh God how we know that he would love to be in the house of God this morning worshiping God. Father we think of all the years that brother Dods have sjourned with us. Father, what a soldier. What a mighty man of God. Father, what divine respect we have for our brother this morning. We ask you, oh God, that the Holy Spirit would reach down in a special way and touch him, Father, and raise him up for your glory, and we'll be sure to be reminded there's still a God in in Cloverdale Bible way, oh God, who is doing mighty things amongst us, Lord. and all the other requests, Father, we bring before you this morning, knowing that you're a God who is able to do the exceedingly abundantly above all we can ask or think. We pray that every prayer request will be met. Father, every need that your believers, your sons and daughter, daughters are holding before you this morning, please answer them, Father, we pray. And then we'll be &gt;&gt; happy to give you the praise and the glory, Father. and for the most important part of this service. Oh God, the unveiling of your word this morning to us. We know that your servant has set himself aside and has received from you, Lord, a word that will change us this morning. A word that will meet every need, Father. For the word is quick and it's powerful and it's sharper than any two-edged sword. Father, we pray that the word will go through the very dividing aunder of the soul and spirit this morning and let it discern every need in your divine presence. Father, let every need be met here, every spiritual need, Father, will be met. Everyone who is desiring, oh father, a closer walk with you. Oh, grant it to them I pray this morning. Everyone who's desiring encouragement, encourage them this morning. Every sick one, Father, the word will heal them this morning. Every financial burden, every financial need, you will merge in our divine presence this morning, Father. So we commit this service to you. We asking you, oh God, that you would take your servant in the palm of your hands and use him, oh God, get the man out of the way and let the word come forth with power and demonstration of the Holy Spirit. And we will leave you Lord like those who came on the word of the mayor saying, "Did not our heart stir within us? Did not our heart burn within us, oh God, as we walk with him along the way this morning?" Yes. &gt;&gt; So we want to thank you for your divine presence here this morning, Father. And we want to thank you, oh God, that you were here to meet every need, every situation, Father, for the word of the hour has come to meet every situation, Lord. And we pray that you will take absolute control of this service this morning. In the name of Jesus Christ, we ask these things. Amen and amen. Amen. Amen. You can have your seats. I want to welcome all those who are visiting with us this morning. We're just real happy to have you here and trust that you'd feel comfortable in God's presence. And uh we um we want to mention this morning that our brother Emerson born, brother Emerson's headed back to uh to New Zealand. So make sure everyone give him your greetings and uh we just wish him God's speed as he heads back and trust that he'll be back here again with us before too long. God bless you. Um also, um all the counselors who signed up for winter camp, there will be a fiveminute meeting in the fellowship room immediately after the service. Um and as well, I understand the school has a fundraiser going on. Uh you can pick up one of these brochures at the back of the uh in the fellowship room um or in the back of the church um bulletin board. And uh it's about photography, the wonder of God's creation. And uh so you can get all the information there from uh and if you've got any questions, Sister Heidi Davis or Sister Joanna Bergen, you can talk to them. Amen. The choir has a song for us this morning. And as they come together, let's sing uh I'm casting all my care upon you. I know you love me. So I'm casting all my cares on you. I know you love me. [Music] Will redemption my love. Thank you Lord. That's the greatest story. Oh, for restoration, [Music] for redemption. That's what seven angels in a cloud testify. My redeemer no longer dead.

That's what seven angels cloud testify. My redeemer no longer can be risen and he's coming back for you. [Music] [Music] Heat. Heat. [Music] We walk by faith and not by sight. Our eyes look to the unseen. the Lord Jesus Christ. For he has promised that we would reign with him. But the pathway to glory is through suffering. So count it all joy when you fall in diverse temptations. For it's only to bring you to that perfect place. Oh, we are tested and we are yet in the midst of it all. We give a peace of mind for the trying of our faith. work in patience for my low cali. He restores my soul and he gives me strength to keep pressing on. [Music] Sometimes we pray, "Oh Lord, please take my life. I just can't go on. I don't know what to do." But in that hour, we find our juniper tree. And there the angel comes to strengthen for the journey ahead. For in our weakness, his strength is made perfect. And his grace is sufficient for us. [Music] Though we are tested and we are trying in the midst of it all of my for the trials of our pain &gt;&gt; and in my valley he restores my soul and he gives me strength to keep pressing on. Although we are tested and we are yet in the midst of it all for the tri of our faith work and patience. In my lowest valley, he restores my soul. And he gives me strength to keep pressing on. Though we are tested and we are trying yet in the midst of it all, we get a peace of mind for the trying of our faith. For in my own valley, he restore my soul and he gives me strength to keep pressing on. Although we are tested and we are trying, yet in the midst of it all, we get a piece of mind. for the tri of our face. &gt;&gt; For in my lowest valley, he restores my soul. &gt;&gt; And he gives me strength. &gt;&gt; When I'm down in the valley, he gives me strength. &gt;&gt; In the midst of my trial, he gives me strength. &gt;&gt; I'm pressing on. He gives me strength to keep pressing on. For in my lowest valley, he restoreth my soul. [Music] And he gives me strength to keep pressing on. Yes, he gives me strength to keep pressing on. [Music] Praise God. &gt;&gt; I'm so glad I don't have to rely on my own strength. Amen. Uh there's a little chorus that brother John Andy's uh wanted us to learn.

I envisioned his grace. I saw love, mercy, and grace. Amen. Let's sing it together. I saw love, mercy. [Music] Heat. Heat. Heat. Heat. Heat. Heat. I will [Music] mercy and praise. Just before the choir goes down, I'll ask the question that I've been preaching about. What seeest thou? &gt;&gt; What have you seen? Thank you, brother Roy. I saw love, &gt;&gt; mercy. &gt;&gt; Oh, I'm glad I saw mercy. &gt;&gt; Grace, &gt;&gt; we're glad we saw grace. &gt;&gt; Abundant grace. &gt;&gt; Boundless love. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; We're entering into that this morning. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. We've been in a spirit of revival. &gt;&gt; Praise God. Amen. &gt;&gt; Wednesday's meeting almost went out of human control. &gt;&gt; I would just saying, "What do you want to do, Lord?" &gt;&gt; That's what we sooner have. We sooner have God in control. And that's what we want to be pointing our whole effort and direction this morning. Let's just sing it once again. I saw love, mercy, and grace. I saw love mercy and gracy [Music] [Applause] and I am if you mercy and [Music] Amen. I'll had let you have your seats for a few moments. I'd like to draw your attention to uh this weekend. It's going to be very very busy. So, you want to make a mental note of uh the days our brother Joseph Green who's pastoring now the church at first his father pastored, brother Henry Green and then brother Dan Daisley. And now since both of them have passed on, brother Joseph Green is a pastor and he will be here for Friday. There will be no service Wednesday. The service will take place Friday and Brother Green will be with us that night and also on Sunday, both services. But on Thursday, uh we'll be having a presentation, not here in the church. It'll be in the fellowship room. Uh and uh Erdan uh uh our guide from Turkey is going to be here. He's arriving the day before on Wednesday the 4th. So they'll be getting ready and he'll be giving a presentation for those that are interested. And this is uh this will be the excuse me the first presentation will be on the cities of the church age sites and some of them are you know have considerable ruins and others have not yet been excavated probably never will be. Uh but uh that will be taking place on Thursday the 5th at 7:30 and then on Saturday the 7th will be the second presentation and that presentation is a different presentation that is on the footsteps of the apostle Paul. And the purpose of these presentations are so that you will be introduced to what a tour would be like if and when you would like to take one. There probably will be a tour taking place this year and I we don't know till Erdan gets here whether that will be a late spring which I think is too early for a lot of people to get their vacation time and get the necessary funds put aside uh for that tour but there may be sufficient only probably takes about 25 people for a tour but I think we'd probably be having about maybe as many as 50 just depending on the on the congregation but he's just coming here to let you know this is what this is what it's all about and these are the sites and there is about uh I think around 60 PowerPoint slides on one of the presentations and over 90 on the second it's not going to be long long drawn out but you'll have a time to you know speak and mingle with Erdan after to ask questions if you wish And I do not know how many want to come, but we can handle perhaps 300 350 people in the fellowship room. Uh but both presentations are different. That's what you have to understand. They're both different. So if you would like to take it in, you should perhaps be there early to get a good seat. And uh uh so I just felt to do that. Uh this uh this guide uh Erdan is more than a guide. He was a teacher and instructor of guides for uh for the association or for the government. He is vice president of Tatu Tours right now and that's in Ismir uh and u I found him to be just a excellent excellent person. He's just a very very fine man. Of course, he's not a believer, but we were made in we were put in contact with uh him and his company. Not his company, but he was doing some guiding for this company. We were put in touch with them originally through brother Doug Lens in Ottawa. And uh they've he's had I guess quite a bit of contact with them. So anyway, that is this uh this weekend. So, we're going to be Thursday, Friday, Saturday, and Sunday are going to be it's going to be a busy and a full weekend. Um, next month we have a brother uh in in March, I'm sorry, it's in March. Yeah, in March, we have brother Jason Jackson coming up. This church has never met Brother Jason. He's a young minister and uh I just felt he's from Arkansas and I just felt to invite him. So he's he's going to be coming here around the middle of March also to uh I just want the church to become acquainted with more of these younger men that are rising up and taking places of responsibility and that God is using. Uh so there's a lot happening happening everywhere and we're thankful for it. &gt;&gt; I just don't want to take up any more time. I started to think about talking about some other meetings, but I think that we'll we'll just go to the word at this time. All right. Why don't we stand and we're going to pray and then I'm going to read. And I would like to ask that you would just be completely yielded to the Holy Spirit today. Oh God, Father, without you, we can do nothing. We confess that this uh building is filled with people and they're in the fellowship room and uh mothers in the nursery and there are those that are streaming right now live streaming and we are indeed grateful oh God for the bride of Jesus Christ the bloodbought and I feel Lord even unworthy to stand here before this purchased company purchased by your love, purchased by your blood, purchased by a perfect sacrifice to bring forth a perfect bride, spotless in the name of Jesus Christ, one that would be wedded and is wedded to the son of God. Oh, Father, how we long and yearn for that time, Lord Jesus. And we feel the pull of the invitation, the wedding supper invitation. I pray that you will take control of the service now. Take control of the speaker, oh God. Take control of the channel. I pray you will blow the flu out. Let there be nothing in the memory or the imagination. Let there be nothing in the conscience that's condemning. Oh God, let there be nothing in the reasoning that would war against the word, Lord. Let there be nothing, I pray, in any of the channels, oh God, but let your word find that channel to the soul, I pray in the name of Jesus Christ. And may it come down that channel in faith &gt;&gt; so that the impossible may take place. &gt;&gt; We thank you, Lord, for our brother Edwin Dods and the progress that has been taking place. I know he's been prayed for. I want to remember him as my dear brother, father. Pray that you will just encompass him with your divine presence now in Jesus Christ's name. Amen. &gt;&gt; If you'll take your Bibles, please, and turn to Genesis the uh 11th chapter. And while you're turning to Genesis, the 11th chapter, I just want to make this comment. We've been on the subject of what seeest thou spoke the first uh service from Amos and the Lord asked hell what seeest thou? You'll remember that Amos the Amos the prophet Amos was the one brother Brandham spoke of on way of a true prophet. He brought a brought a very very very stiff hard message uh to the people of his generation. It it was because the Israel had long forgot God and long forgot who they were supposed to be. And the scripture tells us about that and brother Brandham details it. He said they had great the greatest buildings and the religious systems and so forth that they had ever had and altars built everywhere. So they certainly were not a non-religious people. They were very religious people. And he said Israel was at its height and it was in alliance with all the other nations. It it essentially had peace and it was very glamorous. Uh just think of it. and the women dressed to the spot and the men and they were pleasure stricken and running races and Olympics and everything going on. And of course, here's the Lord's day. We're here to celebrate the resurrection of the Lord Jesus Christ. And of course, there's multitudes that have no time for that because they're busy with their football and busy with their bicycle races and whatever else going on. But we're in the house of God. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And we're so glad we're here. But God was saying to Amos, "What seeestest thou?" He said, "I see a plum line." And that is something you build to. And God was letting him know that that he and his word was a plum line to that nation. And they had gone far from it. And then we had the second one last Wednesday, part two. And what seeest thou? And uh it seemed that God really came down and witnessed to us as we spoke about the generation that brother Brandham was sent to. And he was telling them that they'd seen too much. They saw the genuine. They saw the genuine baptism of the Holy Ghost. They saw the genuine deliverance. She said, "You've seen prostitutes and alcoholics come off the street and come into the glory of God, but you've seen so much it became too common and took the faith out of you." That's something we never want to see happen. &gt;&gt; So, we want to hold dear this Lord Jesus Christ as he's revealed himself to us. And now I'm doing a complete turn. We're asking God, "What seeest thou?" &gt;&gt; Because we're going to read where God now came down to see what the people were doing. &gt;&gt; So, we'll read the first verse. And the whole earth was of one language and of one speech. And it came to pass as they journeyed from the east that they found a plain land of Shenar. And they dwelt there. And they said one to another, "Go to let us make brick, and burn them thoroughly." And they had brick for stone and slime had they for mortar. And they said, "Go to let us build us a city and a tower whose top may reach unto heaven, and make us a name," and that name is a reputation. It means fame. Let us make a a name, fame, a memorial, lest we be scattered abroad upon the face of the whole earth. And the Lord came down to see the city and the tower which the children of men builded. You may have your seats. And you will need your full focus this morning. So do not be distracted if people move or they have to move. And I would ask those that if you have children that you'll do everything you can to have as little movement as possible. There have been a number of times in the scripture where it either says directly or indirectly infers that God came down and God came down to see what was taking place in a in a given generation. And the Bible says here, he came down to see. And I do not believe that he came down to see physically what the people were doing because God's all knowing. I don't believe he came down to see geographically where they were and you know where they were moving and what they were doing. But he came down to see and I will show in the scripture each time specifically or just with inference that the way God sees is that he delivers his word to a generation. He delivers his word to his people and then he looks to see their response to that word. And that is how God viewed a a people. That's how God viewed Israel. That's how God is actually looking on us today to see our response to the word and observing the the people. Jesus said, "I have many things to say and to judge of you, but he that sent me is true, and I speak to the world those things which I have heard of him. And if any man hear my words and believe not, I judge him not. For I came not to the world, not to judge the world, but to save the world. He that rejectth me and receiveth not my words, he hath one that judgeth him the word that I have spoken. &gt;&gt; The same shall judge him in that day. So now the physical person being Jesus Christ himself, he didn't come to speak and and show that he was judging the world or judging the people. Said I didn't come to judge the world. I came to save the world. But the words that I speak will judge them. In other words, the response of the people to what he said was either their salvation or their judgment. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's the principle. That's the pattern. &gt;&gt; Genesis, as we know, is the seed book. And we find in Genesis, in singular form, the things that we find in the end time, in the harvest time, in a multiple form, a multiplied form, we find it that way in the end time. And so what the people were doing in the in the Genesis and the scripture which we read this morning, uh the people what they were doing, they were building a city and a tower, the tower of Babel and then they con and and and they constructed it in the land of uh Shenar, but rather because of the scene, what the scene represented. It wasn't it wasn't just so much that it happened to be right there geographically and that these people were doing it, but God had a reason of of identifying what they were doing specifically what they were doing because it was in seed form. And God was not just coming down to see what they were doing, but how that reflected and how and and you you'll see this very clearly in the scripture. When God was looking at the Tower of Babel, he wasn't just seeing that mortar and clay &gt;&gt; and bricks, but he was seeing what that Babel was going to be in its harvest form. Amen. &gt;&gt; He wasn't just seeing those people there, but he was seeing the multiplied hundreds of millions and billions of people and what they'd be involved in in in the end time. &gt;&gt; Now, uh, Babel, Brother Brandham says concerning Babel is the original name for Babylon. Now, some of this may just sound historical, but I need all of this for for foundation material. So, you listen very very closely. So, Babel is is the original name for Babylon, and it means confusion. And so, much of this may be, you know, very elementary to you, but I want to tie some things together today. He said it was ilit it was literally started by Kush the son of Ham uh but was brought to a kingdom of power and grandeur under his son Nimrod the mighty hunter and as you know Ham was one of the sons of Noah. So now the tower of Babel in the message go out of this evil age. He said notice his plans to build a super denominational church, the world council of churches, a super denomination so that all the world will worship him. See what God was looking at back there. This is what God is looking for. Came down to see it. But he's seeing what this what this had reference to. what this was typifying, what this was signifying all down through history. You could see that that was Babel that was going to ripple all the way right to the end time and going to be one of the keynote things that's going to come to destruction. &gt;&gt; And that Satan, his arc enemy, was going to use whatever was happening here in seed form. It was going to grow and grow and grow and grow until the end time. And there God was going to deal with it in the end. And so it'll be a super denomination so that all the world will worship him. See, what God was seeing there is that Satan, his arc enemy, Lucifer, is going to use what he's sewing there and the people he's got in control there to achieve a worship &gt;&gt; in the end time. &gt;&gt; You follow that? &gt;&gt; And all the world will worship him, the beast, under the name of United Christianity. And and folks, I won't say sorry, but I'll say attention. Behold, we didn't just read Genesis, but we happen to be right here where the prophet is speaking of. We're here in the other end in the other end of it. He said, "Would you like to read in the in the Bible in Revelations 136 and 8? It's a modern tower of Babel." &gt;&gt; And here is the scripture that brother Brandham referred to. and he opened his mouth in blasphemy against God to blasphe his name and his tabernacle and them that dwell in heaven and and he drops a line in and them that dwell in heaven and he's referring to Rome. He's referring to that system because they were the first one to put a system into place. And that and the seeds of this system, the seeds of the entire Roman uh system, the seeds of it were sown back there in Babel because they Babylon of today. &gt;&gt; And he says, "And to and to blaspheme and his name and his tabernacle and them that dwell in heaven." He said blasphemed them by saying they were intercessors, them that are in heaven. The blaspheming, the blasphemy that they committed, which is being done today while you're sitting here, &gt;&gt; they're teaching it all over the country, all over the earth, &gt;&gt; that those that have gone are intercessors for us. &gt;&gt; That's blasphemy. &gt;&gt; There's only one that can intercede for us. &gt;&gt; That's the Lord Jesus Christ. And so he said they bla they blasphemed them by saying that they were intercessors. And the scripture goes on and it was given unto him to make war with the saints and to overcome them. And power was given unto him over all kindreds and tongues and nations. And all that dwell upon the earth shall worship him whose names are not written in the book of life of the lamb slain before the foundation of the world. How thankful I am for that verse &gt;&gt; whose names are not found. &gt;&gt; I'm standing here today and you're seated here today with that confidence, &gt;&gt; absolute assurance in our heart that our names were found in that book. And thus knowing that their name was found in the book, Satan cannot deceive &gt;&gt; and he will never have our worship. &gt;&gt; We will never be drawn into his system. &gt;&gt; We will never be drawn into his circle of fellowship. &gt;&gt; I don't care how ecumenical it becomes. We can never be drawn into it because we've been already separated from it. And already the veil has been pulled. He has been exposed and we see him for what he is. &gt;&gt; I say hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Glory. &gt;&gt; So what God was seeing what God was seeing when he saw and came down to see what the children of men, he came down to see the city and the tower. What God was seeing was a highly organized civilization reaching into the heavens. Here we are, a highly organized civilization, reaching into the heavens, stripping his name from worship &gt;&gt; and worshiping their own flesh &gt;&gt; and the work of their own hands. &gt;&gt; He saw Satan &gt;&gt; back there when he looked at Bible. He saw Satan, Lucifer, in the end time being crowned &gt;&gt; in his Eden &gt;&gt; in his scientific achievement &gt;&gt; and his religious babble of confusion. &gt;&gt; The scripture does not indicate how he came down but is clear that he did come down to see the city in the tower. doesn't say how he came down in that instance. He came down again which I'll come to in a few moments. He came down to see Abraham and Sodom &gt;&gt; and he said, "I've come down to see if it is the way has had been told me." &gt;&gt; In both cases, he came to Abraham to see what Abraham's response would be to his promise. He came to Sodom to see what they would do at the message of the two angels. &gt;&gt; And the prophet says clearly that that their message blinded them. &gt;&gt; According to Usher, Usher's uh uh is is very highly considered in their history. But usher's uh date places Babel, the account of Babel 106 years after the flood. And I'm only giving this just to give you a little bit of background. And in that time, even acknowledging that Noah's children began having children of their own very soon after the the the flood, the total world population could not have grown very large. Yet the Babel account clearly says that the men started to build a city. And yet the word city is used in the story. the the city really means a place that's guarded. So, and it and it has reference to people being awake and being guarded and protecting it. So, the a city doesn't need to be that large. It would perhaps be the size of a town in in our language today. So, the sons of Noah each had sons of the three sons. One had four sons, one had five sons, and one had seven sons for a total of 16 families. 106 years allows time for five generations. And if each family produced eight more families, the population could reach at least 65,000 people in uh 106 years. So this is what we're talking about. So that's the setting. So possibly there's as many as as 65,000 people. But you notice the scripture says they said let us that and and they with one mind began to do this. So the first thing that we have back there is a democracy. They're starting to achieve a system and the system is actually a democratic system because it became the voice of the people. Let us build a city and they set to do it together. So they had a they had a a a unity of sort. They had a democracy of a sort. They had an advanced form of living and where uh a large number of people they gathered into one place. Let's identify this place where they would live and work. They developed a form of government because a city requires that and a standard of social social life, social standards. So let us build a city. So there's a turning point and that is back there. So hold those things in your mind. The second thing is and a tower. Now the Bible says clearly and God came down to see the city and the tower. Didn't come down to have fellowship with the people. Let's come down and see what they are doing. And the seeds of our modern society were sewing right there. &gt;&gt; There's coming a system &gt;&gt; uh to to to unite the people together. And this tower in the Hebrew is an elevated place which which speaks of in my mind of advanced technology. Let us make a memorial and a tower is also security and and there isn't any place in the world today there is no nation that hasn't got security someplace in their thought. &gt;&gt; We need to secure our borders. We need to secure our government. We need to secure our people. We need a form of security. So, let us build a tower. Let us build a memorial. Let us not be scattered and forgotten. Uh let us be identified as being a a civilized people. We have a certain order in place. And so, this is what was taking place. Now, I'm just taking a quantum leap in the message handwriting on the wall. Brother Brandham says Babylon was first located which it is yet in Shenar and it was first called the gate of God. Babel, Babel and later was called Babylon which means confusion and Babylon appears in the first of the Bible in Genesis and it appears in the middle of the Bible and it appears in the last of the Bible in the last book Revelation and being that it's all through the Bible it must be in existence yet today. I want to just announce to the congregation as I'm preaching and feeling led of the Holy Spirit in this part three of what seeest thou. It's God now who came down to see &gt;&gt; and I'm asking the question, Father, what did you see? Father, what are you seeing? What seeest thou &gt;&gt; in this day in Cloverdale Bible way &gt;&gt; in the ranks of the message &gt;&gt; and our civilization? What do you see? &gt;&gt; Because we know that he will be motivated as we are by what he sees. &gt;&gt; Good &gt;&gt; in God of this evil age. He said he's making a reference and he said it's a modern tower of Babel. Nimrod that hypocrite hypocrite hypocrite built this big tower and made all the other cities pay tribute to it. Babel is the same thing. It just changes its name as it comes on up. Rome now is Babylon. And the whole world's brought to Babylon. You ought to see the who's who list that goes there. &gt;&gt; And it's brought in by the World Council of Churches, which will make everyone of them bow to her. and you took the mark of the beast, not knowing what you were doing. But he said, "But those who are elected will hear the word and come out of it." &gt;&gt; And there's a group of people here today that have come out of it. Amen. &gt;&gt; And one of the grandest things that I can think of today is I'll be able to say to you, young and old alike, and those on the telephone or the streaming, we ought to rejoice from the depths of our soul that we know that we will never take that mark. &gt;&gt; I say glory to God. &gt;&gt; What protection do we have? What a glorious thing that God has done &gt;&gt; that we don't have to sit and tremble or have fear. We are not going to be seduced by that deceiver to take that mark. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Think of it today. There are many being sealed in by taking that mark &gt;&gt; unknowingly, unwittingly &gt;&gt; because he has so deceived the generation. So he says Rome now is Babylon and the whole world is brought to Babylon. You've heard the phrase commonly referred to as the the Vatican and they refer to the Holy Sea. And I thought I would like to just understand a little more about the Holy Sea. this this system. Brother Brenle refers to Rome as being the first system. Pentecost was birthed without a system. &gt;&gt; It was divinely orchestrated by the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; And that is why in my own heart even today I yearn. I yearn for the direction of the Holy Spirit. &gt;&gt; I'm not interested in man guiding things. I'm interested in God guiding things. &gt;&gt; Not interested in man's systems. &gt;&gt; Brother Brandom didn't say what he said about, you know, the church order and the the hospitals and the schools and the Bible schools and all those things. wasn't saying it because he was just opposed to those things, but they were a system that man had set up to try to accomplish the work of God. And God's work will never be accomplished that way. &gt;&gt; So the Holy Sea is a they said the expression the Holy Sea refers to the supreme authority of the church and thus the pope as bishop of Rome. Now this is out of directly out of their material. They have uh websites that want to explain to the people how the internal workings of Rome are conducted. And this is from uh one of their sites. And uh it it says that the u supreme authority of the church actually the holy sea has reference to the uh the cardinals that the the the supreme authority of the church within the cardinals and the pope is the bishop of Rome and the head of the college of cardinals and as such the holy sea is an institution which according to the international laws I want you to listen very closely The Holy Sea is an institution which according to the international laws and customs has a judicial personality which permits it to sign treaties and to send and receive diplom diplomatic representatives as judicial equivalent of a state. And that actually is actually quite recent because the Vatican became the holy city in recent times in most of many of our lifetime. The state of the Vatican City and the Holy Sea, both sovereign subjects of international public law, universally recognized, universally recognized, are indisolubable, uni, indisolubably united in the person of the Supreme Pontiff as head of state who possesses full legislative, judicial, and executive powers. s the state of the Vatican, which probably most of you do not know, and I didn't know till I've read this, they mint their own coins and issue their own postage stamps. The bishop of Rome is the bishop of the Holy Sea, uh, more often referred to as the Pope. statements of brother Brandham now statements that he made that I will be making now quoting him are very revealing. He says that pagan Rome which was what was in power when Christ was here only changed its mask &gt;&gt; and became papal Rome. So you can be sure that all of its darkness, &gt;&gt; all of its violence and evil that were back there are still with it &gt;&gt; only in a more sophisticated way. &gt;&gt; All of its uh cruelty &gt;&gt; and that it displayed down through the dark ages, it's all still here. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So he says this, people look at Rome, they look at the nation of Italy and as they look they do not realize that Rome with her strict confines where the pope has an actual area as his domain. This is in the Pergamine church age is literally a nation within a nation. Right. Right. &gt;&gt; And she has ambassadors and receives ambassadors. See how he refers to that. Now the one is actually from the website of the holy sea. And they're saying and describe the internal workings of how they have ambassadors and their judicial powers that they have the executive powers and so on. Here's here's a prophet of God speaking of how she has ambassadors and receive. That's very important because she has to have ambassadors and receive ambassadors because she's got to make her agreement with with Israel &gt;&gt; and break it. &gt;&gt; She has to make this covenant. &gt;&gt; So this system that man set up which was in in the tower of Babel was indicative of what we are seeing. So we're going way back there and say all the seeds were sewn there, we're seeing it here in the harvest farm. &gt;&gt; He said papal papal false Christian Rome. She's even called the eternal city. How blasphemous. now controlled by religion even more aly than when pagan imperial Rome controlled by the pure iron force. Rome took on a new lease on life when Constantine joined church and state and backed the union by force. The spirit that motivated pagan Rome is the same spirit that now motivates false Christian Rome. And you can see that it is because you know that the fourth empire never went out of existence. It just changed in its outer texture. Now it says that they spake one language back &gt;&gt; at the Tower of Babel and God said let's go down and we bring confusion &gt;&gt; and people spoke different languages etc. And today I will say not that everybody is being forced into or everyone ever will speak the same mother tongue. But I think that you could see and at least I want to suggest to you that the world is becoming or has become a global village. And so the idea is not to have everybody, you know, there there isn't a great movement of foot to have everybody speak Chinese or German or Russian or or or English even, even though a lot of people want to speak English, it's not that so much. But the but the theme of what was set up back there, the theme of democracy, for example, democracy is is like one language. People are striving for freedom &gt;&gt; because the spirit of the age of Leodysia is one of people's rights. &gt;&gt; And so the spirit that come upon the people is causing them to think to say the same thing maybe in different languages, but they're saying the same thing. We want freedom. &gt;&gt; We want control of the people. &gt;&gt; They're saying the same thing economically. We want a better life. No matter where you go to the hinterlands or some jungle or wherever more people are striving for a better life because we hear about it. We see what other people have. We want that also. We want a better economy. We want a higher standard of living which is what Babel was representing. And so in what in that sense the nations today of the entire earth are similarly speaking the same language. Very good. Right. &gt;&gt; Same kind of government, same kind of economics, same kind of system of religion. Now, brother Bram speaks about democracy at its best is at its end. in hearing, recognizing, acting on the word. He said, "Politics, war, politics is at the end. Dictators is wrong. Politics is wrong. Why didn't they stay with the godly king like God give them David?" The great Lord of England said, "When this do democracy was formed," he said, in quotation, "It's all right now, but it'll come it'll come the time." He said, "It'll be nothing. It'll be all sales and no anchor." I think we've arrived there, don't you? &gt;&gt; He said, "And and he's right. Politicians stand on soap boxes on every corner with all kinds of crooked things that corrupt the government." And the man was right. That's exactly what's going on. In the fifth seal, he goes on to say, "Do you see why organized systems is wrong? Who started it? Did God? Did the apostles? The Roman Catholic Church did it. &gt;&gt; Now, just let any historian say different. He said it's not there. They say they're the mother church and they are. But they organized the thing and put a system with man's head to it. We didn't take one man like they did. We take the whole council of men and put them together and then you really got confusion. He said it's just like we think democracy is right. I believe it is too, but it'll never work right. &gt;&gt; So, I hope these things are meaning something to you. &gt;&gt; Amen. You know, I'm I'm I'm perhaps stretching it a wee bit, but I think that I think that at the Tower of Babel, the seeds of democracy were sewn back there. &gt;&gt; And the seeds of unity and the seeds of a system were sown back there. And that is why that reverberates all through the scripture right up till right up to this time. And he said, 'But it wouldn't work right. He said, 'It's just like we think democracy is right. I believe it is, too, but it'll never work right. It can't uh with a bunch of rickies around it to run it. How in the world are you going to get it right? You can't notice the real thing is a godly king. &gt;&gt; Now, a godly king is a not a democracy, but it's a theocracy. And a theocracy is a government of a state by immediate divine guidance &gt;&gt; or by officials who are regarded as divinely guided. &gt;&gt; And brother Brandham says a godly king. That's the right. And in the millennium, you're not going to have a democracy. &gt;&gt; In the millennium, it's not going to be the voice of the people. In the millennium, it'll be the King of Kings. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And we worship him. &gt;&gt; We have every right to worship him. &gt;&gt; We are now his subjects. &gt;&gt; We already have our passport. [Applause] &gt;&gt; Glory. &gt;&gt; We're already citizens. So the second occurrence of God coming down and I'll just touch on it. This time two angel messengers sent to Sodom and one remained with Adam, I mean with Abraham. And he lifted up his eyes and looked and lo, three men stood by him. And when he saw them, when he saw them, what sayest thou, Abraham? &gt;&gt; Well, when I saw them, I ran. &gt;&gt; I ran to them. &gt;&gt; And he ran to meet them from the tent door and bowed himself to the ground. &gt;&gt; And this one that stayed with him said, "Is anything too hard for the Lord? At the time appointed, I will return. &gt;&gt; I will return unto thee according to the time of life, and Sarah shall have a son. Why shall she have a son? Because Abraham had the right response to the word that came to him. &gt;&gt; And that's how God saw him. That's how God viewed him. And when God viewed him and saw his response, he said, "You're my friend." &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And let me say something, friend. And that has never changed. &gt;&gt; Abraham was his friend when God regarded him as his friend. And that has never changed. He's always been his friend. &gt;&gt; And when God regarded you redeemed by your response to the word of the hour, you will ne he'll never change that. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; I don't care about your ups and downs. I don't care about your failures or the weaknesses. That will never change. &gt;&gt; Amen. When he stood and said, "You are my redeemed. &gt;&gt; You are my bride. You'll never be anything else than the bride of Jesus Christ." &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Glory. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And the Lord said, "Because the cry of Sodom and Gomorrah is great, and because their sin is very grievous, I will go down now and see." And when he said, "See, I will look at it. I will perceive. I will ponder this. I will consider it. I'll regard it. I'll watch it and I'll find out. I will appear, make my presence known. But it was at a different level. And I've said many times that God how he comes down. He may come down in an angel. He may come down himself in the form of an angel, which is the angel of the Lord. &gt;&gt; He may come down in a pillar of fire. Yes. &gt;&gt; He may come down at a certain level of intensity so that you you feel awed, you feel aruck, you feel humbled, you feel broken, you feel unworthy. He can come in so many many faceted ways. &gt;&gt; And he can come down in such a way to turn you speechless. &gt;&gt; He can come down with such intensity that your breath would leave you &gt;&gt; and you'd fall into perhaps a trance. He can come down with such intensity that you couldn't survive &gt;&gt; physically. &gt;&gt; His holiness is so great. If he came here, we would literally evaporate. &gt;&gt; You don't believe that? &gt;&gt; He came down in the form of Jesus Christ. John walked with him. John ate with him. John slept with him. John laid his head upon Christ's bosom. He never once fell down as dead. He was in the boat with him. He was in the judgment hall with him. He lived with him for maybe three and a half years. Never once fell down. But when he saw him in Revelation 1, he fell down as a dead one. &gt;&gt; That's the same one, but a different intensity. &gt;&gt; So some say, well, Oral Roberts and Billy Graham, you say what the prophet said. They're messengers &gt;&gt; and he can come in whatever intensity he wants to come. &gt;&gt; He can manifest himself in whatever way he wants to. One didn't have any signs. One didn't pray for the sick. He just preached and he was with the presidents and he was with the high-profile people and played golf with them and all the rest of it. That's how God wanted it. &gt;&gt; He had to reach a certain level of people. He had to say a certain thing and blind the people. &gt;&gt; And they became blinded because, you know, everybody's getting born again. &gt;&gt; Everybody's making decisions. But then a prophet comes and says, "You have to have a master, a master mason to shape your decision. &gt;&gt; Everybody can make decisions. Multitudes can make decisions. But unless God comes by an extra measure of grace and shapes your decision, It'll never hold. &gt;&gt; Help me. &gt;&gt; So God came down and to see is also not only to appear but it is to present oneself. So God presented himself in the form of those two angels to the men and women of Sodom &gt;&gt; and they they responded in a certain way. &gt;&gt; They responded according to the spirit that was in them &gt;&gt; and they were destroyed &gt;&gt; in hellfire and brimstone. Do you believe that? Amen. &gt;&gt; And scarcely did Lot and his family get out and his wife turned to a pillar of salt because she looked back to the good life. &gt;&gt; To see is to cause to look at intently and to behold and to cause to gaze at. But to see also is to look at each other face to face. That was his intent. Now I'm going to digress for a moment, but it's it it is it ties completely together. So don't become distracted. Zachchariah, brother Brandham used Amos as the text for the way of a true prophet. There were some prophets. Brother Brandon refers to them as minor prophets. We refer to them as minor prophets. They weren't I guess we refer to them as minor prophets simply because their books are small. They didn't prophesy very very long or it doesn't appear that they did. And then major prophets, you know, Isaiah, Jeremiah, Ezekiel, and so on. But Zachchariah, the prophet Zachchariah, Zachchariah, he prophesied and made statements that were in direct reference to the rebuilding of the temple. Zachchariah was one that would be directly involved in the rebuilding of the temple. Zachchariah made prophecy and made statements which I'll read that referred to the first advent, the first coming of Christ. Zachchariah makes prophecies which refer to our time. &gt;&gt; And Zachchariah made statements and prophecies that refer to after our time. Amen. &gt;&gt; For example, through Zachchariah, he preached he prophesied and said, "For thus saith the Lord of hosts, after the glory after the glory hath he hath he he sent me unto the nations which spoiled you," speaking to Israel. For he that toucheth you toucheth the apple of his eye. So he's telling Israel, you're the apple of his eye. Even though God so sternly spoke against Israel, &gt;&gt; but he was telling him that they were the apple of his eye. &gt;&gt; So now in Zachchariah when he he he was the one that was and this is a key now. Hold this please. Zachchariah was one coming out of Babylon. Out of Babylon. Don't forget it's tied right back to Babel. Now, here is here's a prophet and he is a prophet to a remnant. &gt;&gt; Coming out of Babylon or out of the systems. &gt;&gt; So, he's a prophet. He's a remnant. A prophet speaking. His prophecies are to a remnant. &gt;&gt; Just hold that. He prophesies concerning Jesus first coming. And Jesus his ministry was to a remnant. &gt;&gt; He just brought a few out &gt;&gt; of the old systems. &gt;&gt; And what did the scribes and the Pharisees says? We have we have Abraham to our father. We've got the law. We've got the prophets. They had what they had was an empty system. &gt;&gt; And Jesus regarded them. You do have &gt;&gt; the law and the prophets, &gt;&gt; but you Abraham Abraham rejoiced to see my day and he saw it. &gt;&gt; What is saying? He saw it, but you're not seeing it. &gt;&gt; But Zachchariah was to a remnant. He prophesied of Jesus. And Jesus went to a remnant. Zachchariah spoke of our time and a messenger that was coming. And don't forget, I have so much to say. I hope you're following it. And don't forget, brother Brandham was not only a prophet. He was a sealer. &gt;&gt; Not on your behalf, &gt;&gt; on God's behalf. &gt;&gt; So we can say, "Oh prophet, what seeest thou?" &gt;&gt; For you are being directed by Almighty God. No man gave him the gift. &gt;&gt; No man made him a prophet. &gt;&gt; No man gave him that access to the unseen realm. &gt;&gt; And so now you have a vessel we could say, "What seeest thou?" &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; I don't know if you feel I feel an awesome presence. I feel aruck myself. I feel a tingling &gt;&gt; at where we are &gt;&gt; today. &gt;&gt; And and and people have missed their time and missed their season and missed their day. I say, "Oh God, don't let Cloverdale Bible way, don't let the people who've come under this message, don't let us miss our day. Don't let us be blinded by the things around us clear up our eyesight. &gt;&gt; Take away the shades from us. Take away the blinders and let us see. where we are. [Applause] &gt;&gt; Let us see the true picture as it is. &gt;&gt; God was saying, he said to Amos, he said to uh Zachchariah, he said to others, what do you see? I think it would be God's prerogative and his own he could do it according to his own will today. And I feel that he's speaking through me, &gt;&gt; saying to you, what do you see? &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. I'm glad we've seen what we have seen, but I'm not willing to sit back and just, you know, be all kind of filled with some false emotion that I've seen it in Malachi 4 and so on. I want to see this God manifesting himself in this body, in this life, in this church, in this people, in this message. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Is that too much? No, it's not too much. &gt;&gt; How many are in agreement with that? How many can say that's what I want to see also? &gt;&gt; And so Zachchariah, he prophesied and he was coming to a he was sent to a remnant of people spoke of Christ and Christ was sent to a remnant of people. spoke of this time and actually spoke of the ministry of brother Brandham and others of the messengers. And brother Brandham of all of the seven was sent to a remnant. &gt;&gt; Come out &gt;&gt; from among her, &gt;&gt; and be separate, says the Lord. &gt;&gt; What's he doing? He's calling a remnant, &gt;&gt; a remnant, &gt;&gt; out of the church. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And when Zachchariah spoke, God held the people accountable &gt;&gt; to the word that came through him. &gt;&gt; When Jesus came, I already read the scripture to you. God held Israel responsible and accountable for the word that was spoken through Jesus Christ. That's true. &gt;&gt; God established Israel as a nation and to achieve his own purpose and will in them as one nation of all nations. And God is holding, hear me, &gt;&gt; the whole world accountable to the word of God that's being fulfilled in that nation. &gt;&gt; And that's what God's looking at. Amen. &gt;&gt; And the and the same message will come to 144,000 and God will hold that nation accountable for how they receive the word that comes to them. &gt;&gt; So God holds them accountable. And Zechariah also says, "Rejoice greatly, oh daughter of Zion. Shout, oh daughter of Jerusalem. Behold, thy king cometh unto thee. He is just, and having salvation, lowly, and riding upon an ass, and upon the colt, the fall of an ass. &gt;&gt; There's the prophecy. &gt;&gt; And now, a messenger to a remnant is speaking of another messenger coming. And he'll come lowly and humbly, and he'll be riding on the f of an ass. &gt;&gt; But he also sent to a remnant &gt;&gt; and only a few would hear him. and he was finally only left with 11. &gt;&gt; He comes to the remnant of the Jews of the 144,000. And here's what Zachchariah says about that time. And his feet shall stand in that day upon the Mount of Olives, which is before Jerusalem on the east. And the Mount of Olives shall cleave in the midst thereof, toward the east, and toward the west. And there shall be a great valley, and half of the mountain shall remove toward the north, and half of it shall remove toward the south. Speaking of the time beyond our time, &gt;&gt; when he makes himself known to the 144,000. &gt;&gt; And so now here we are. &gt;&gt; Have to bear with me, please. I I don't want to drag this out, but are you listening? &gt;&gt; In the message of the token, brother Brandham says, "The bride will be the remnant, will be the little group selected, the predestinated." And I know that brother Brandon refers to the church as the remnant very often, but in this case, I just wanted to identify the bride and using the terminology remnant as a very, very few. Now, Zachcharias prophesies and here I'm coming to the main part of my message. Excuse me for being so long, but he prophesies. Zachchariah prophesies and his prophecies encompass the church ages and our time. And I won't refer to all the church ages, of course, but I'll just refer to our time. Zechariah 4:10. And brother Brandham, I'm going to read where he makes reference to this. For who hath despised the day of small things? For they shall rejoice and you shall see the plummet. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; You shall see the plummet &gt;&gt; in the hand of Zerubbable. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; With these seven, &gt;&gt; they are brother Brandham says they have to be men. &gt;&gt; Amen. it because it is not you know it is it is they are &gt;&gt; the eyes of the Lord. &gt;&gt; They are the eyes of the Lord. What seeest thou Lord? &gt;&gt; Which run to and fro throughout the whole earth? &gt;&gt; Yes. Bellingham, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; And Seattle &gt;&gt; and Edmonton &gt;&gt; and the rest of Canada. and Chicago and Bombay and Durban and Johannesburg and all over and Phoenix and Shrefport all over. What was it? A meeting. Oh, they had a great meeting. I say they had the eyes of the Lord running to and fro throughout the whole earth to see them who would respond positively to the word of God. And when I saw the word in its intensity for healing of the body, the flesh, it says, "Oh, well, give me more. Give me more." And when he come with the word, &gt;&gt; telling women how to dress, that their hair should not be cut, telling men and telling preachers and telling ministers and telling telling them how they should not serve the system, but they should serve the word of God. And having ministers say, "I know. I know that's the word of God, but if they But if I preach that they, who's they, the system that was set up in Babel will kick me out. &gt;&gt; Are you getting what I'm saying? &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Is it clear to you? &gt;&gt; There's a message. Brother Brandon preaches one service and I can't recall just now exactly where it is. I think it might have been Phoenix. He had so many meetings there and it's hard. I can feel it coming through the the through the voice. I can feel it. I can I can actually feel the atmosphere and it is so He's preaching hard. He's preaching straight. He preaches on influence. I believe it is one of the influence messages. And the place is just quiet. You can feel that animosity, that adverse adverse against the message, that contempt. And when he's done, he gives an altar call, says, "Is there anyone that might want to be like uh would you like to be like this Isaiah? You'd like to give your life to Christ? Nobody. Nobody. And he lingers and he goes on and I think they're playing something. Then he says, "All right, here comes a man. God bless him." Maybe he's like an Isaiah, I believe, is what he says. God bless him. Now he says and that don't forget that angel the Lord who's none other than the Lord Jesus Christ was God himself &gt;&gt; seeing &gt;&gt; seeing the response of the people and that was their response. So then he began to reveal the secrets of the hearts of the people. Never called any line just instantly almost spontaneously. And he begins to call a name and pointed down here. Pointed down there. Call that name. This is your situation. Your situation yours this Mr. so and so, sister so and so. This woman here, that woman there, that man over there, that man there. Call their name. And then the whole place just came alive. Now he says, "Now I wonder how many need the Holy Ghost. I wonder how many." And the place just flocked. He said, "Now there's probably 200 here." He said, "I did that to show you that you're deceived." &gt;&gt; Why are they deceived? Because they were ready to They would not wander. They would not respond to the word, &gt;&gt; but they responded to the sign, to the emotion. They responded to healing. &gt;&gt; That's not it, folks. It had to go from a first on the second blow. It had to We're not children of that. We're children of the word of God, being born again, of the incorruptible seed of God. How thankful we are that God gave you a revelation of the promise of God and you responded to that. &gt;&gt; You can say today, I saw that &gt;&gt; I saw him &gt;&gt; in all of his beauty. &gt;&gt; Are you with me? &gt;&gt; I saw him &gt;&gt; with those seven. They are the eyes of the Lord that run to and fro. In the message of grace, brother Brandham reads this scripture from Zachchariah. And the angel that talked with me talked with me again and wake me as a man that is wakened out of his sleep. And he said unto me, here it is to Zachchariah. What seeest thou? And I said, I've looked, and behold, a candlestick all of gold, and a bowl upon the top of it, and his seven lamps thereon, and seven pipes of the seven lamps which are upon the top of it. And two olive trees by it, one upon the right side, one upon, and the other on the left side thereof. So I answered and spite to the angel that talked with me, saying, "What are these, my Lord?" And the angel that talked with me answered and said unto me, Knowest thou not what these be? And I said, "No, my Lord." Then he answered and spake unto me, saying, This is the spirit. This is the word of the Lord unto Zerubabel, saying, Not by might, not by power, but by my spirit, saith the Lord. Who art thou? Oh, listen very close. Who art thou, oh great mountain before Zerubabel? Thou shalt become a plain. It's amazing. It's similar words to Isaiah's words concerning John the Baptist. Every hill will be made &gt;&gt; as a plane. Who art thou, oh great mountain before Zerubable? Thou shalt become a plain and he shall bring forth and he shall bring forth the headstone thereof with shouting crying grace grace unto it. Brother Brandham says we and we know that this was during the time of the preparation of the restoration of the temple. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hold on to that. I'm not reading anything but this came at the time of the preparation of the restoration of the temple and Zerubabel was a great prince brother Brandon speaking now amongst the people who had laid the foundation of the building. He was one that came to a remnant. He's at uh at a time of rebuilding the temple of the nation for the nation with a remnant of people coming out of Babylon. &gt;&gt; Oh. &gt;&gt; Oh my. &gt;&gt; He says, "And I want you I want you to put on your spiritual thinking. And I am praying that God will give every person within the sound of my voice at this moment a Holy Ghost divine portion of spiritual thinking. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Anointing anointing jacket this morning as we think. And this great prince had determined to rebuild the house of the Lord. And then when he did, he had laid the foundation stone. And as we read on further, we find out that God said, "Zerubbable hath laid the foundation with his hands. He also shall bring forth the headstone." He said, "I want you to notice he never said he shall bring forth the cornerstone. He shall bring forth the headstone." &gt;&gt; So he who laid the foundation will bring forth the headstone. He says, "And we know the scripture says that Jesus is the chief cornerstone and he is also the head stone." Now, if you will think for a few minutes that the seventh church age messenger, these seven are the eyes of the Lord. that the seventh church age messenger was to restore the faith of the children back to the fathers. In other words, and he gives it a different phrase now. In other words, rebuild the church again &gt;&gt; under the power of the spirit. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Whoever was speaking through Zachchariah, &gt;&gt; making reference to Zerubbabel and he laid the foundation stone, he said, he that laid the foundation stone shall bring the headstone. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And comes and now the messenger to the remnant of the gentile age while they're making preparations to rebuild the temple. Here comes the last messenger &gt;&gt; and he is a sea. Amen. &gt;&gt; True. &gt;&gt; Not merely a preacher. &gt;&gt; Not only a prophet, &gt;&gt; sir. &gt;&gt; But a seer prophet. &gt;&gt; One who saw. &gt;&gt; I couldn't even go through the times because there's hundreds. It's into the hundreds of times that he made reference. I see. I see you coming. I see you in this situation. I see. But he saw other things as well. And now we have a messenger coming at the time when the capstone who talked about the capstone who talked about the headstone. This messenger talked about it because it was his ministry. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; That's your time. &gt;&gt; That's where you're living today sitting in this church. But this is your day. &gt;&gt; Zachchariah prophesied of your time. And the same one that laid the foundation brings the headstone. &gt;&gt; And he said, "And if you'll catch it," that's why he warned the people, "Put on your thinking jacket now. Pinch your conscience cuz the same one." And he says, "And and and the seventh messenger is to restore the faith of the children back to the faith of the fathers." In other words, rebuild again &gt;&gt; the temple of God &gt;&gt; the spiritual temple of God. &gt;&gt; We've lived to see it. &gt;&gt; We've lived to be part of it. &gt;&gt; We've lived to be part of this temple. [Music] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Nothing could be plainer. &gt;&gt; Nothing could be more clear. &gt;&gt; It's just sits and sewing all the way through. The seventh messenger was to restore the faith of the children back to the fathers. In other words, rebuild the church again under the power of the spirit and then quotes the scripture from Zachchariah. Not by might, not by power, not by might, but by my spirit, sayith the lord. And then he puts other language to that. Not by organization and not by denomination. Hallelujah. what he's saying. It's not by Babel. [Music] &gt;&gt; It's not by the organization of the city. And God came down to see the city. &gt;&gt; He came down to see where democracy got them. He came down to see where the man-made unity got them. He's come down in this time to see where the ecumenical system has gone. And they have, and I have quotes on it, they've rejected the word. &gt;&gt; He uses, he said, they turned it down. And he preached it clear, but they turned it down. And God was there looking through those prophets eyes as a seer to see their response. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And they rejected to accept death. He says, "Not by organization and not by denomination, but by the Holy Spirit, God will bring forth the church in these last days." You know why you're here? Because God has brought you here by the power of the Holy Spirit in these last days. And without that, you couldn't even be here. Without that, you'd have nothing in you that would pull you to it. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And if you're here just a visitor, if you're here just as an observer, if you're here that has just come along and been kind of riding the fence, I would say to you, this is not a time &gt;&gt; to be sitting on the fence. This is not a time your life is wasting away. Your time is going away. Your breath is leaving you. This is the time to say, "Oh, God, &gt;&gt; let whatever this pastor is preaching about today, let it be a reality within me. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Now he explains the very act of restoring listen now. The very act of restoring the faith of the children back to the fathers is the same event not another one. It's not a likeness. It's the same event of the rebuilding of the church again &gt;&gt; under the power of the Holy Spirit. He says to begin with Sardisian church age to begin with he said we know for certainty that these verses are not teaching a new contrary doctrine to John 4:24 God is one spirit &gt;&gt; going to draw to a close now soon but he said but this is like 1 Corinthians 128 and 11 to 11 wherein we find one spirit manifesting himself in nine ways, the gifts of the Holy Spirit, the nine gifts. He said, "Thus we know that the seven spirits of God mean that it is the one and same spirit coming forth in a sevenfold way." Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Now in Revelation 4:5, the same seven spirits are called lamps of fire burning before the Lord. And since John always used nothing but the Old Testament symbols of the revelation in the revelation, he says, "We go to the Old Testament and we find from Proverbs 27 that the spirit of man is called the lamp of the Lord. These seven spirits are found to be associated with man. John the Baptist was John 5:35 was called a burning light which should actually be translated as a burning lamp. And again, Revelation 5 and 6, the seven spirits are identified with as seven eyes. And I behold, and lo, Revelation 3:5-6 rather, I beheld and lo in the midst of the throne and in and of the four beasts. And in the midst of the elders stood a lamb as it had been slain. This is him taking the book. Now, as it had been slain, having seven horns, the lamb that John turned to see the lion, and you've heard it so many, many times of different preachers within the message. And he turns to he says, "Weep not John, for the lion of the tribe of Judah prevailed to loose the seals." And he turns to see the lion and the steady he sees a lamb. &gt;&gt; Now the lamb has seven horns. Horns is always power. and seven eyes which are the seven spirits of God sent forth into all the earth. And Zachchariah said this just so you remember. And who despised a small day of small things? You talk about small things. 11 men, 11 apostles. That was a small thing. Only reduced to 11 and a few women. And then finally 120 were in the upper room. That was a very small thing with the population of the earth. But now the earth when this prophecy of Zerubbabel came or prophecy of Zachchariah rather came to this time as one man a grade seven education &gt;&gt; raised in poverty &gt;&gt; in nowhere &gt;&gt; in Kentucky and God sets his spirit upon him and anoints that gift that had been given him. He was born a prophet. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He didn't know what it was. &gt;&gt; He went to the wilderness. He went to the cave. It was driving him to a nervous state. And he heard voices. Heard the Lord speak in the trees, in the leaves, in the wind, in a strange life you talk about. And there's a few billion people by that time, maybe four billion, I don't know, a few billion people on earth. You talk about not despising. I can tell you one thing, God was not despising the day of small beginnings. And even eventually on one occasion when we we just came together up in northern British Columbia and he said I I stopped by Oral Roberts on the way up here. Oh my. He said, he said that, you know, they got that hospital and his offices and the aluminum ceiling and he was trying to describe, you know, the architecture and oh, he said, you know, he said that drive me crazy to try to run something like that. Said it just he didn't have a bad thing, didn't have a negative thing. He just said that's not the way, you know, God led me. He said he you hear it. He says, "My office, I've seen it. one little one little desk like a child's desk for doing homework and and when I stepped in his office had another chair in his chair there only two chairs and everything else was bare but what came out of that office &gt;&gt; nothing less than the word of God &gt;&gt; and the messenger There was nothing less than the eyes of God. &gt;&gt; A seer in the end time. &gt;&gt; What do you need to see? What seeest thou, Father God? What do you see? In Amos's time, you saw people glamorous, living the good life. This is what God was interested in. You want to see their response to the word that he brought through the way of a true prophet. Can I have just a few more minutes and I'm going to close whether I'm done or whether I'm not done. Says with those seven, they are the eyes of the Lord people. We've been viewed. I I I've been pondering this very deep. God took the vessel and the intensity of that vessel, the intensity of the presence of the Lord in the presence of brother Brandham. go back and see Deep called the Deep and you'll see the woman coming and standing and she's standing like this and then she reaches out to steady herself at the pulpit and he says to her, "Don't worry, that won't hurt you." &gt;&gt; That's not me, that's him. He says other places you should see the faces of the people when an evil spirit is in a person and comes in contact with that power and that presence said their face will begin to their throat begin to throb visually changing the the the appearance because they simply have come into the presence. I tell you my brother, my sister, just to think that you and I have come under that gaze and I know what that gaze is a little bit about. But I will tell you that you no less than myself. We have all come under that gaze. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. What a glorious, marvelous thing this morning &gt;&gt; to think that you've passed under that gaze &gt;&gt; and have him say you're mine. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Something happened to me today. It's never happened in my life. And I started to write it down and I couldn't write it the way and I started to change it and I couldn't change it. He said, "Say it." I've preached here many times over many years. And I have seen visually people rejoicing, people receiving, people accepting. But unfortunately, I've also seen physically where people are just disdaining the word. &gt;&gt; They don't want to hear that word. They don't want to hear what's being said. And God said to me this morning, I was looking through your eyes. &gt;&gt; That's true. &gt;&gt; It wasn't you that was determining that. &gt;&gt; You saw that because I was looking through your eyes. And I said, "Oh, God." And actually, to be honest with you, he's looking through your eyes. The bride of Jesus Christ is not merely the voice of God in this end time, but the eyes of God. He's looking through your eyes and you see things and it disappoints you. It disgusts you. It disheartens you. It saddens you. You become burdened and you start feeling as Marilyn said inspired in her song said, "I don't feel welcome here anymore." &gt;&gt; Right? &gt;&gt; Is that how you are? &gt;&gt; The eyes of the Lord go to and fro throughout the whole earth. That's why you look you look upon your friends, your peers, your children, your family. You look upon them not to bring a condemnation to them, but you look upon them and you have a different a whole different vision because it's not the merely these faculties that are in here, but it is something that's inside and you actually see things. You see it different. You have a completely different balance, a different understanding completely. And he says that they are the he said they are the eyes of the Lord. He said it refers to man, the messenger as a seer. He saw what was. He saw what what what had been. He saw what was taking place and he saw the future. &gt;&gt; And here's some of the things because I don't have time, but here's some of the things. And you've you've you have access to this, but he said, "I see the spirit of Hollywood." I wonder if this congregation has had those eyes. &gt;&gt; Have you seen the spirit of Hollywood? He said, "I see the spirit of the world. I see the spirit of glamour." He says, "I've been 15 years preaching against it and it just worsens all the time. I can see it and I see the spirit there." But where is the spirit of God that can grasp God? that can recognize the word itself when it's being made manifest to recognize the truth. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; But then he said, I see the word is the absolute. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Somebody's got to respond today. &gt;&gt; You've seen the word, but have you seen the word to its depth of being the absolute? &gt;&gt; The absolute. &gt;&gt; Got to go back to the absolute. Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; I see the word not just Malachi 4 and Luke 17:30 and Revelation or whatever more. It's not just some, you know, it's not just some doctrines. It didn't just say I see the doctrines or I see certain truths or I always agreed with that. That's not the point. That's not the revelation. The revelation is I see the word as the absolute in my life &gt;&gt; and that never changes &gt;&gt; because I've just spoken even I and my wife sitting at home speaking about this very thing not because I'm preaching and she doesn't know what I'm preaching this morning never we don't discuss it but we've been talking about the absolute in our lives what God would have us to do. We're not young people but we're always seeking to know what God will have us to do. We need God's thoughts, not man's thoughts. &gt;&gt; We don't need a system. We need the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; We don't even need the formality of a meeting. We need the hundreds of people that are here to be lost in God. &gt;&gt; Be a praying people. &gt;&gt; Are you with me? &gt;&gt; I want you to be able to say amen to God's word. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Glory to God. &gt;&gt; I know what meetings are like when they came out of the hands of man. &gt;&gt; I've seen people stand and worship God lost in the spirit of God. And back then they didn't have the message. They didn't have the word to anchor them. But there was something within them that they wanted to worship God. I've seen them stand for an hour and a half. &gt;&gt; You're quiet. &gt;&gt; Is there anything wrong with it? &gt;&gt; Is God worthy of an hour and a half of worship? I say he is. &gt;&gt; Let the roast burn. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Let the reservation at the at the restaurant, &gt;&gt; let us forget it. &gt;&gt; Amen. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; People lost in God &gt;&gt; and out of the control of human hands. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; I'd like to preach on it. I don't know if I'll get to it, but brother Brandham says, "All I do, I just yield." &gt;&gt; Yield. If there ever was a time when God needed a people to learn how to yield. Just yield to God instead of being conscious about who's next to us and who's here and what kind of person I am. Forget what kind of person you are. &gt;&gt; We don't want to be so stayed and so right and so correct that we miss the the the moving of the Holy Spirit. We've got the word. We say amen to the word. I tell you what friends, this place can't really we can't even do justice to the truth as as little as the truth is that I preach this morning. We can't do justice to the even the single truth that the eyes of God have passed through this age, this time that you and I are living in. The eyes of God passed through your little circle of endeavor or your life at some point in some time where you worked, where you lived. the eyes of God to say, "Oh, someone handed a a message into my hand. Someone handed a book into my hand. I heard someone preach. Someone spoke and witnessed to me." I want you to see it different than you ever saw it before. Listen to this statement. This God that was with the prophet of God that caused him to be a seer, that God has never left this message. &gt;&gt; Has never left it. &gt;&gt; Has never left it. He won't leave it for a moment. It's his word. &gt;&gt; He is actually the spirit. He is actually the life and force of that word. And so he hovers right beside it. And when someone handed that book to you, Brother Roy, or someone talked to you, the eyes of God were right there to see what was going to be the response. And you said, "Amen." [Applause] &gt;&gt; And God said, "That's it." &gt;&gt; That's what my elect say. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. That's what my child says. &gt;&gt; That's what my seed says. &gt;&gt; They say, "Amen." They can't help it. &gt;&gt; It's a part of them. It's in them. &gt;&gt; It's like a hand fitting into a glove. &gt;&gt; They can't say anything else. [Applause] &gt;&gt; Glory. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Glory to God. &gt;&gt; Glory to God. The eyes of the Lord running to and fro throughout the whole earth saw what you your response. Don't ever be moved from that. &gt;&gt; Then who cares what happens in life? &gt;&gt; Be it life or death, health or sickness. &gt;&gt; Wealth or pop or popularity or none at all. That has nothing to do with it. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And the prophet said I see the word. I can say yes &gt;&gt; messenger. &gt;&gt; Yes. Prophet seer. I see the word also. &gt;&gt; I have the same eyesight. &gt;&gt; I see the word. I see the pillar of fire moving. &gt;&gt; I wish I saw more of it. But I have actually seen the glory of God come upon a person and I knew the thing they were asking for was done. &gt;&gt; Finished. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; There's a man standing right there. Brother Roger Camper, if you would stand. &gt;&gt; There was a brother, Brother Roger won't mind. He was bound hopelessly bound by cigarettes and with a spirit of depression after he received this word. He sat right down here. I remember the meeting. I remember the morning and I literally saw the word of God come directly to him and I knew at that instant he was free. And as I'd been sober, brother of the Roger. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Glory to God. We need to rejoice. We need to rejoice in that as though it happened 5 minutes ago. What is it? It's a pillar of fire. The same one that caused a cancer to drop causes that demon to be loosed from him and drive him out of that temple and the Holy Ghost moves in says this is my temple. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And you are temple of the Holy Ghost. Brother Roger, don't ever let the devil ever say anything. We are temples of God. &gt;&gt; Glory to God. Hallelujah. Tell you what, friends, I feel a long ways from closing this service. &gt;&gt; I feel that God wants to do things even right now. You'll receive the word, receive the promise. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; But the eyes of the Lord are going to and fro throughout the whole earth. This the eyes of the Lord is going through this service, &gt;&gt; this gathering of people at this time to see what your response is to this message. [Music] Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; I've never remember reading this before. I guess I must have been in a meeting. The prophet's preaching in his eye, be not afraid. And he said, 'I want to make it a little drama in the testimony. How many times how how many likes testimonies? He asked. He said, "Brother Eddie told me." And he said, 'You know, brother Brandham, after the meetings are over out there, he said, "My Indian brethren said that they'll get together and start testifying and a meeting will break up right out among them and they'll go over." He said, "Then they quieten down and after a while then somebody else get up and testify and out breaks the meeting again." And he said, "They just stay there." And as long as the spirit's there, they stay. He said, "That's real good, sound philosophy, not philosophy, but good sense." He said, "It's the staying with the spirit." He said, you know, wherever the spirit of God moved, the pillar of fire, wherever it moved, then the children of Israel went with it. I say, I want to go. I don't necessarily want to follow my neighbor. I don't want to follow what my wife has planned today. I don't want to follow anybody. I want to follow the pillar of fire. As long as you want to do something here, God, I'm with you. &gt;&gt; I want to be part of it. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. We don't want manled meetings. We want God meetings. &gt;&gt; Come, oh Lord. &gt;&gt; How glad I am. And I want you to be able to rejoice. How glad I am that those eyes &gt;&gt; of this word of this Christ looked upon us &gt;&gt; with love &gt;&gt; mercy &gt;&gt; and grace &gt;&gt; and I don't care &gt;&gt; what the cost but whatever is truth now say as Mary said what he saith unto you do it. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; This is an area of your life and there isn't anybody here but what we could there's could be things that could change and I'm saying oh God speak oh God speak to us. This is my cry this morning. Speak oh Lord &gt;&gt; is anybody here away from God? Anybody here in a backsliden state? I would not go out those doors in that condition. And I would give myself unreservedly in my seat right there or down here at the wherever it is. But I would make it right with God. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; I want to have a communion service soon. &gt;&gt; I want to see some things happen before we have that communion service &gt;&gt; take place. Want to see God move. &gt;&gt; Amen. Things that may be a-ok okay with the public or a-ok okay with someone else out there. doesn't necessarily have to be okay within the spirit of God. We need to remove all the all the debris. &gt;&gt; Get rid of all the stuff. &gt;&gt; Get rid of all the garbage. As brother Brandham said, don't keep living on the dump out there. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; We're having a service. What do you see? &gt;&gt; Just a bunch of emotion. No, I don't see it. I see the word. &gt;&gt; I see the Holy Spirit &gt;&gt; striking our hearts. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I believe when a man or woman is born of the spirit of God, that's it. &gt;&gt; It's over. &gt;&gt; It's not up and down, in and out. &gt;&gt; I'm closing with this. I've been 10 minutes over my time now. &gt;&gt; He said, "I see the sign of the end." And and and and as as as I as I quote what he sees, if you see it, I want you to respond to it. He said, "I see the sign of the end time is here." &gt;&gt; Mind, that was few. &gt;&gt; About six or eight people. The prophet of God, the eyes of God, the eyes were in the horns said, "I see the sign of the end time is here." And I say, "Amen." &gt;&gt; I see things as promised for this end time message coming to pass unfolding just exactly like the scripture said. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And I know that the time is at hand. For I see the signs that he said would happen just before the time it's ready to happen now. &gt;&gt; And he asks a question. What do you see when you see him? &gt;&gt; Amen. said, "I see the same healer. &gt;&gt; We need him. &gt;&gt; We need him." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I got a little great granddaughter's not walking properly. &gt;&gt; And she needs something to take place. &gt;&gt; She needs a different signal in the brain and needs her muscles to be strengthened. &gt;&gt; I don't care what the doctors say. I don't care what the symptoms say. &gt;&gt; This is what God's eyes have said. &gt;&gt; What do you see when you see him? I see a healer. &gt;&gt; You see a healer. &gt;&gt; You're here in some situation, some condition you've put up with. See a healer. &gt;&gt; Deny the enemy &gt;&gt; right now. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Yes. &gt;&gt; Receive it. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Mental depression.

Receive it now. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; When I see him, &gt;&gt; what do you see? said, "I see a healer." &gt;&gt; Amen. He said, "I see the same one that walked here in Galilee." &gt;&gt; I see the same one. &gt;&gt; There's no difference whatsoever. I see the same one that walked here in Galilee. Do you see it, my young brothers? &gt;&gt; Do you see it, my friends? &gt;&gt; Do you see it, believers in Jesus name? Hallelujah. Do you see the same one? He's not there somewhere else. He's here, here, present. He's with this word. We are believers of the message. He will never leave that message. &gt;&gt; And that is why he said to the disciples and many many people quote it, but he said to the disciples, "I will never leave you." &gt;&gt; Because he cannot leave the word they receive. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Do you see it? Do you see what I'm saying? &gt;&gt; He can never leave the word. [Music] Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Millions heard, &gt;&gt; millions received healing. &gt;&gt; The secrets of hearts were revealed of millions of people perhaps. &gt;&gt; And they will say the same scripture. He'll never leave me nor forsake me. And I say, God bless them for that. But what Jesus is talking about is the word that went from his mouth. I will never leave that word. Amen. &gt;&gt; And that's how God sees. &gt;&gt; That's how God looks upon this generation. That's how he looks upon us. None of us are beyond that eyesight. [Applause] &gt;&gt; I say, "Shine on me. &gt;&gt; Look on me, oh God. &gt;&gt; Look on me. Whatever there is that is unlike you, then send a divine fire. &gt;&gt; Don't be afraid of the fire, let it burn up. &gt;&gt; How many here need something that need to be removed. &gt;&gt; You don't need to wait for another day. You need to have it right now. &gt;&gt; You need to say, "I accept this message. I accept this word. I accept this time. &gt;&gt; This thing has no business in my mind. It has no business in my spirit. It has no business in my whole life. &gt;&gt; I deny it. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; I'm under the eyesight of Almighty God. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; That's it. &gt;&gt; You go into communion with him. &gt;&gt; Has nothing to do with me.

We don't want to just come to services. How was the age of some of you fellas right here? 14 and 12 years old. And the meeting started in the morning and by midafter afternoon I was so hungry and other young people were so hungry but we didn't want to leave to go and get a sandwich for fear we would miss something &gt;&gt; that God was doing friends. It's the same Holy Spirit. &gt;&gt; He's not interested in the buffet and Earls and all the other or Tim Hortons and stuff that's just part of this life. We have enough just to get us through. But he's interested in what he's seeing. Your response to the word. There ever was a respon. Respond to his word. Respond to his word. Don't leave it for another day. It won't be easier tomorrow. That's a lie of the devil. Don't leave it till tomorrow. This is the hour. This is the time. [Applause] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Glory to God. &gt;&gt; Amen. Could ask a brother up here in the balcony. Brother white shirt. I'm sorry. Just after all this preaching, my memory has failed to just call on your name. I wonder if you'd come down and pray. Brother's a minister also. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Let's be an expectation. Amen. &gt;&gt; We don't know what God is going to say to us tonight. But one thing for sure, when he speaks, the man of God behind the pulpit, when he speaks, &gt;&gt; he's looking. Just remember that your response. That's what he's looking. That's his eyes. He's looking on that. Amen. &gt;&gt; And I'd sooner be more eager than more stayed and more, you know, formal. I' I I'd sooner I I'd sooner be Peter jumping out of the boat. &gt;&gt; Even if he did start to sink, but don't forget he didn't drown. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; That's just the way I am. That's what I believe. &gt;&gt; Amen. Come our brother, pray a prayer blessing. There's a brother that knows how to pray and I love your prayer. Amen. Before his brother, &gt;&gt; shall we bow our heads in prayer? Let me just get this off the way. I want you to hear this prayer. Pray a blessing upon the people this day. Our gracious heavenly father, we come with sincerity in our hearts. We have been taught by our prophet that we must come before you with absolute sincerity. And father today with all that is within us we approach you. Father we come upon sacred grounds. We come upon grounds Lord that only the privileged and the blessed are allowed to come because you have released a portion of your presence Lord. enough that we do not we are not struck dead but just enough Lord to bring the fear of God in our hearts. &gt;&gt; We thank you this morning for the demonstration of your word. &gt;&gt; We we know that today it was just not another service of another gathering coming together on the Lord's day but we know that today father you have stretched forth your hands &gt;&gt; and you have focused your eyes upon your children. Yes. &gt;&gt; And if we never knew before that you took special interest in us, this morning we believe that you do, Lord. &gt;&gt; You have focused your tender eyes upon us. Not eyes of anger, but eyes of love. &gt;&gt; It is not the eyes of flame, a flaming fire, but it is the eyes of of a dove. You have looked upon us with love in your hearts, with pity, with tenderness, with compassion. Father, we thank you this day that you have anointed your servant to bring such a blessed word to us. &gt;&gt; Words of life, words of beauty, words of hope. &gt;&gt; And Father, today we have energized this word. And this word we have believed. This word we love. This word we oh God appreciate so much. the living word. Father, we thank you for the congregation who have listened attentively and have committed themselves also in response to the word. You have looked upon this response and you are pleased this morning. I know I feel in my heart that you are pleased, Lord. And so as we come today to the end of this service, Lord, we give you honor and thanks that again you have met our needs. You have healed our bodies. You have touched our lives, Father. You have delivered us, Father, by thy word. You sent your word and you healed the people. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And Father, your prophet says that more demons are cast out at the preaching of the word than actually what we preach, oh God. And so we have been set free. We have been liberated. Demons have left our lives at the preaching of your word. Father, we thank you this morning. And Lord, as we go to our respective homes, we pray that you will give us the rest of the day in your presence and with another portion richly a flag and of wine and a good piece of flesh. We thank you this morning as we go. Bless the ministry and bless the people. Order our footsteps in your way in the name of our beloved Lord Jesus Christ. Amen. And amen. [Music] Amen. We're going to dismiss you in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and come early. Have a good seat. Be an expectation. Just want to say this because it just come to my mind last week. You know, sometimes even behind the pullpit a minister will say something and perhaps it's just a wrong thing to say. and I I made some comment about the new president of the United States and and I just uh I I didn't feel good about it after and so I just want you to forgive me. Uh I think we need to pray for a man that's got such responsibility as he has and u pray that God will give them wisdom and at least we know one thing. Everything's going God's direction and our confidence is in the Lord. So we don't need little little barbs or little snide remarks. And so I just wanted to make that right. So God bless you. Have a good afternoon. Get some refreshment and we'll see you this evening. Amen. God bless you. God bless you. Heat. Hey. Hey. Hey. [Music] Heat. Heat. Heat. Heat. [Music] Oh, you know you Heat. Heat. [Music] Heat. Heat. [Music] Heat. Heat. [Music] Heat. Heat. [Music] Heat. Heat. [Music] Heat. Heat. [Music]
