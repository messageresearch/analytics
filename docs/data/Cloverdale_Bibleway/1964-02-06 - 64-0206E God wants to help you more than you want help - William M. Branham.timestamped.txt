[0:00] and When God says he'll do a certain
[0:02] thing that he doesn't there's no more
[0:04] question to it that's the way he does it
[0:06] so God has made a way for us God loves
[0:09] his children he loves his people he
[0:11] wants to help them he wants to help you
[0:13] more than you want help you can just get
[0:16] that in your heart that God's more
[0:18] willing to help you than you are to help
[0:19] yourself but he has a way and that's the
[0:23] only way that he work us through his way
[0:25] you must come to his terms not your
[0:28] terms his terms you it certain way but
[0:31] he he gives it to you his way like non
[0:34] dipping in the the the Waters of Jorden
[0:38] why he said the waters up in his country
[0:40] is much cleaner and better but that
[0:41] wasn't what the prophet said dip here he
[0:44] dipped once leprosy still there six
[0:46] times it was still there he had to obey
[0:48] and come God's way and when he fully
[0:52] obeyed God's way the leprosy left and I
[0:55] say tonight that if we obey God's
[0:57] provided way leprosy will lead sickness
[1:00] will leave everything will leave but
[1:02] we've got to come his way for this day
[1:04] now dipped in the jardan wouldn't do any
[1:06] good now that was for nonon the law was
[1:08] for the for the Jews RAC is by Christ
[1:12] but each age has its part of the Gospel
[1:16] already predicted
