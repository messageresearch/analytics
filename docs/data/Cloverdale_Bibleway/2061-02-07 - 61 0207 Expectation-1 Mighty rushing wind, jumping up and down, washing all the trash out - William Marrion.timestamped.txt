[0:00] and the Revival has to come by the
[0:03] people in your home in your life now
[0:07] Revival isn't adding new members to the
[0:10] church it's Reviving that what we've
[0:11] already got to revive means to bring
[0:14] back so a Revival I stood here some
[0:19] years ago for my first time by a large
[0:21] body of water which was Lake Michigan I
[0:24] was about just has been ordained in the
[0:26] Missionary Baptist Church I was about 20
[0:28] 21 years old and I went up there when
[0:31] they had the they had some great Easter
[0:34] Sunrise Service out on the Lakes side
[0:38] and I was acquainted with Paul Raider
[0:40] and he was supposed to speak at that
[0:42] meeting and I wanted to visit the
[0:44] Tabernacle while I was in Chicago and
[0:47] for my first time to see that larger
[0:49] body of water and I went out on a Lake
[0:53] Shore Drive and I stood out there a
[0:55] little while and I noticed all them
[0:58] waves jumping up and down just just
[1:00] flashing around I thought what's you so
[1:03] excited about what's all the excitement
[1:06] and uh the little waves to start and
[1:09] then run out and beig great big waves
[1:10] and bounce into each other and break a
[1:12] partner and the foam would fly up and
[1:15] then it come back in and I'm see the big
[1:17] waves coming again breaking on the bank
[1:19] like you're used to here but that was
[1:21] something new for for me uh a landlock
[1:25] servant so I noticed how I so what it
[1:29] must must be that the Lakes having a
[1:33] Revival that must be what it is kind a
[1:36] big time just jumping up and down I
[1:38] thought that's that's good that's fine
[1:41] but you know I I thought well once he
[1:44] gets a lot of EX water when it's having
[1:46] Revival well no there isn't one drop
[1:49] more in it right now that it's perfectly
[1:51] calm not one bit it's the same water but
[1:54] just having a Revival jumping up and
[1:56] down I thought what good does that do
[1:58] come to find out when it's having
[2:00] Revival and jumping up down like that it
[2:02] washes all the trash out of it up on the
[2:04] shore that's what the church needs is a
[2:07] Revival get all the world and things out
[2:10] the world washed out so it can look
[2:13] clear be pretty again when it all comes
[2:16] down it's got the same amount of water
[2:18] but what causes the seed to do that is
[2:21] because there is a wind come is to blow
[2:24] against the waves goow against the body
[2:26] of water and pick it up well that's what
[2:28] the church needs tonight is some mighty
[2:31] Russian wind coming out upon it again
[2:33] and Reviving it and getting all the
[2:36] world out and the things of the world
[2:38] out and that way then it starts a
[2:39] Revival and then when it settles down
[2:42] the church is all in condition then to
[2:44] start off then to receive spiritual
[2:46] gifts and blessings from God and that's
[2:48] what we
[2:50] want but in the days of the voice of the
[2:52] seventh angel when he shall begin to
[2:54] sound the mystery of God should be
[2:56] finished as he hath declared to his
[2:59] servants the Prophets
