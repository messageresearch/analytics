[2:37] you thank you for your prayers thank you
[2:40] for your thoughts we uh were gone very
[2:44] short time went Thursday to Ottawa
[2:47] meetings were Friday Saturday and
[2:50] Sunday and uh came back early Monday
[2:53] morning so uh I just thought I would
[2:56] just give you greetings from Brother
[2:58] Mundo and the uh church and the people
[3:02] that gathered there um I didn't have
[3:05] really opportunity to tell you but
[3:07] Saturday Sunday night rather uh there
[3:10] was a message on our phone which we
[3:11] didn't get until uh Monday morning and
[3:15] we're leaving out Thursday and the
[3:17] message was that there brother Mundo on
[3:19] the phone and he was just devastated he
[3:22] said I'm devastated I don't know what to
[3:25] say I uh he said we we can't have the
[3:29] building won't be ready for the
[3:31] dedication and our contractor tells us
[3:34] it'll be two weeks and he said I'm just
[3:37] so humiliated I'm
[3:39] so uh heart sick over this and so I then
[3:43] I tried to call him for about an hour I
[3:45] wasn't able to get him on the phone and
[3:47] then uh then he called here to the
[3:50] church office and and I uh got the
[3:53] message got the call I should say and
[3:55] spoke with him and he said some of the
[3:58] brothers some of the other pastor PS
[4:00] from Quebec and and Ontario had been in
[4:04] touch with him and said building or no
[4:06] building it's the word that's important
[4:09] and we're not we're not gathering for a
[4:11] building we're gathering for the word so
[4:13] we want to go ahead with the meetings
[4:16] anyway uh so he said please you know
[4:18] just just come so that's what we did and
[4:21] they had gotten the convention center of
[4:23] travel large Convention Center downtown
[4:25] Ottawa and uh probably somewhere between
[4:28] 350 and 400 people gathered and quite a
[4:32] few ministers quite a few pastors from
[4:35] quite a number of places and uh one
[4:38] friend of brother Mundo who's a doctor
[4:40] from Chicago came but brother uh Fernand
[4:43] feay from Pastor from Quebec City
[4:46] brother Andre PTI who many of you know
[4:49] from the other side of Montreal brother
[4:51] Jano from Montreal and then people from
[4:55] petroia and Toronto and all over
[4:58] different places in Ontario and I
[5:00] certainly didn't get to meet all of them
[5:02] but there was a real real wonderful
[5:05] Gathering of people and they certainly
[5:07] were uh no pulling on the word they just
[5:10] were not interested in uh getting away
[5:13] too quickly so we had a wonderful time
[5:16] and uh just to be a real encouragement
[5:18] to them I had an opportunity to see the
[5:21] uh church that they're building and
[5:24] really uh outstanding God did marvelous
[5:27] things for this not a large group of
[5:29] people people probably 60 maybe 60 60 to
[5:32] 80 people that are actually in that
[5:34] congregation but they have uh they've
[5:37] constructed a very very nice building
[5:39] and people uh people who are not
[5:42] Believers have just taken them into
[5:43] their heart uh the city of Ottawa which
[5:46] is a city of about a million people I'm
[5:49] told uh they told him the city hall told
[5:53] him that his
[5:55] application for construction of that
[5:58] church had had gone through the city
[6:01] hall the fastest of any application
[6:04] that's ever been in the city hall and so
[6:08] they were able to do it in just a matter
[6:10] of a few short months and it really
[6:12] really is marvelous and and uh the the
[6:15] lawyers and the builders and everyone
[6:17] who has uh been part of putting this
[6:20] building up for them just seem to take
[6:22] them into their hearts and said you know
[6:25] you must uh you must go ahead with this
[6:27] and and at all uh with all speed and so
[6:31] they helped them in every way possible
[6:33] and did what I would say the uh
[6:36] extraordinary I mean more than I would
[6:38] say publicly just went way the Second
[6:41] Mile and it was just like as though you
[6:44] have to do it even when they felt they
[6:46] can't do it he said you must do it this
[6:49] what our finances don't allow and I
[6:52] understand well I guess they won't mind
[6:54] if I say this but he said well we just
[6:56] can't afford it and their own lawyer
[6:59] just unbelieving lawyer says well here
[7:01] he says I'll write out a check write out
[7:03] a check and very sizable check not as a
[7:06] gift he said just you know you'll pay me
[7:08] back at some time but this has to go
[7:10] ahead and so when he saw that happening
[7:12] he said I guess it does have to go ahead
[7:15] we just can't stop and so they saw God
[7:17] behind it over and over and over again
[7:20] and uh that was really
[7:22] wonderful uh so we're really thankful we
[7:25] Rejoice with them and and God was very
[7:28] gracious to us
[7:30] we're happy to be home of course always
[7:33] nice to be
[7:35] home uh I'm going to have you stand if
[7:38] you would please and we're going to just

[10:04] Rapture now preparation for
[10:08] Rapture and
[10:12] uh I just trust the Lord will there's
[10:15] just been some things moving in my heart
[10:17] and I would like to kind of Make Way for
[10:19] for Sunday morning as well uh we'll
[10:22] start at verse 7 of chapter 22 of
[10:27] Luke then came the day of UN leaven
[10:30] bread when the Passover must be killed
[10:33] and he sent Peter and John saying go and
[10:36] prepare us the Passover that we may eat
[10:40] and they said unto him where wilt thou
[10:42] that we prepare and he said unto them
[10:45] behold when you are entered into the
[10:48] city there shall a man meet you bearing
[10:51] a picture of water follow him into the
[10:55] house where he entereth in and used to
[10:58] say unto the man un the Goodman of the
[11:00] house the master SI unto thee where is
[11:03] the guest chamber where I shall eat the
[11:05] Passover with my disciples and he shall
[11:08] show you a large upper room furnished
[11:12] there make ready and they went and found
[11:15] as he had said unto them and they made
[11:18] ready the
[11:19] Passover and when the hour was come he
[11:22] sat down and the TW Apostles with him
[11:26] and he said unto them with desire have I
[11:28] desired to eat this Passover with you
[11:32] before I suffer for I say unto you I
[11:35] will not anym eat thereof until it be
[11:39] fulfilled in the kingdom of God and he
[11:42] took the cup and gave thanks and said
[11:44] take this and divide it among yourselves
[11:47] for I say unto you I will not drink of
[11:50] the fruit of the vine until the kingdom
[11:53] of God shall
[11:55] come I'll I'll I have another reading
[11:58] but I will uh read it a little bit later
[12:00] you can open your bibles if you would to
[12:02] 1st Samuel the 7th
[12:09] chapter maybe I will just go ahead and
[12:11] read it and then I'll make I'll refer
[12:13] back to it
[12:16] then 7eventh chapter and the third
[12:20] verse and Samuel spake unto all the
[12:23] house of Israel saying if you do return
[12:26] unto the Lord with all your hearts
[12:29] then put away the strange gods and
[12:32] ashteroth from among you and prepare
[12:36] your hearts unto the Lord and serve him
[12:38] only and he will deliver you out of the
[12:41] hand of the
[12:42] Philistines God bless you as you have
[12:44] your
[12:49] seats our first scripture reading uh in
[12:54] Luke Jesus telling the disciples to go
[12:58] and prepare the p
[12:59] Passover
[13:01] now uh you must remember that Jesus had
[13:06] he he had the Bible says as was his
[13:09] custom he went to the synagogue on the
[13:11] Sabbath as was his custom Jesus kept all
[13:16] the uh all the law of the Old Testament
[13:20] not living by the law but he kept the
[13:22] law if you understand what I mean he
[13:24] fulfilled the law and so the Bible tells
[13:27] us that he went and that that was in
[13:29] Luke the 4th chapter he went to the uh
[13:32] synagogue as was his custom and so I
[13:35] would like to just say to you without
[13:37] any hesitation this was not Jesus this
[13:40] was not his first Passover he had the
[13:43] Passover he was brought up as a child he
[13:46] was to the Passover every year he knew
[13:50] what the Passover was and uh uh and and
[13:54] so the disciples and no doubt he had the
[13:57] Passover with the disciples they had had
[14:00] because it was an annual Feast to keep
[14:03] the Passover so they knew well what this
[14:06] was all about this is nothing strange
[14:09] but now this Passover is different this
[14:12] Passover is the culmination of
[14:15] Prophecies of types and shadows from the
[14:18] Old Testament all in a one great climax
[14:23] coming because this now would be the
[14:25] Fulfillment of all of those that have
[14:27] been spoken coming right down to this
[14:30] moment and so Jesus said with desire
[14:33] have I desired to have this Passover
[14:36] with you and he and he told the
[14:39] disciples you'll go and you'll go and
[14:43] you'll see this man and you'll follow
[14:45] him and he'll show you uh you'll come to
[14:48] the Goodman of the house and he'll show
[14:49] you an upper chamber Etc and there you
[14:52] will prepare the Passover they always
[14:55] prepared the Passover but this was a
[14:58] very sign significant and very special
[15:02] Passover that they were preparing the
[15:05] disciples I will say and I'm going a wee
[15:08] bit out on a limb but I would say the
[15:10] disciples did not know that this would
[15:13] be their last
[15:15] one with their lord they did not know he
[15:20] knew but he did not tell them this is
[15:23] the last passover I'll have with you but
[15:25] he did say uh he he said to them
[15:29] um he took the cup and gave thanks and
[15:32] divided among yourself I will not drink
[15:34] of the fruit of the vine until the
[15:36] kingdom of God shall come no doubt this
[15:38] was all just mysterious language to them
[15:42] but they did not know this is their last
[15:44] passover this was different and they
[15:47] might have approached it differently
[15:48] because the Bible says even at the when
[15:51] Jesus began to say that one of you will
[15:53] betray me and they're discussing who's
[15:55] going to betray right in the same phrase
[15:58] then they get into St amongst themselves
[15:59] who's the greatest now I don't think
[16:02] they would have been in that kind of a
[16:04] mindset if they'd known this is the last
[16:07] one after this after this our Lord is
[16:12] going to be mutilated in within hours
[16:15] he's going to be stripped naked within
[16:18] just hours he's going to be taken from
[16:20] us and uh it would have been different
[16:23] with them but now I want to speak about
[16:26] this
[16:27] preparation uh uh for for the Rapture
[16:33] because I have felt and I don't know how
[16:36] many I'm speaking to but I have felt
[16:39] that there's been something
[16:41] different that God is doing amongst
[16:46] us and I want to come directly to that
[16:50] there may be a lot of people that don't
[16:52] sense it don't feel it I think that
[16:54] perhaps I should feel it maybe before
[16:58] anyone but
[16:59] I've sensed it in the word I've sensed
[17:01] it the way God is dealing in the message
[17:03] I I see it in the in the conversation of
[17:07] uh of others I I see it's it's like a
[17:10] fresh
[17:11] breeze it's like a fresh
[17:14] stirring and I believe that before we
[17:17] can really benefit from that that there
[17:20] needs to be a a
[17:23] self-examination not a Critical
[17:25] examination but a self-examination
[17:27] within ourselves
[17:29] and and and a searching of our hearts
[17:32] and a
[17:33] searching to what God has in mind why
[17:37] are you moving this way why are you
[17:40] stirring this way if you feel that
[17:42] stirring and I do know that many of you
[17:45] have spoken and and not not just with
[17:48] the services that I've spoken the
[17:49] services that other bre ministering
[17:51] Brethren have spoken and there's been
[17:53] things that have been said that have
[17:56] struck you very very deep moved you you
[17:59] very deep and you've written notes and
[18:01] you've called on the phone and you've
[18:03] left voicemail and uh and all kinds of
[18:06] all kinds of messages to let let me know
[18:10] that there's something very deep that
[18:12] God is doing within your life and and
[18:16] and stirring your heart and I believe
[18:18] that we need to capitalize on that I
[18:22] don't believe we should just and that's
[18:24] what my message is today and will
[18:25] continue on Sunday I don't believe we
[18:27] ought to just sit back and take church
[18:30] service as we always took a church
[18:32] service uh uh live our life like we
[18:35] always lived our life uh I think we
[18:37] ought to say God what would you have me
[18:39] to do uh reexamine what what what do you
[18:44] want me to do do I need to rearrange
[18:46] things are there things that I need to
[18:48] actually physically
[18:51] do now when
[18:53] Samuel when he came to this statement
[18:56] that he made there a little bit of a
[19:00] background uh to this phrase to this
[19:03] scripture rather that I read and I just
[19:06] want to give you the background Israel
[19:09] even though they were God's
[19:11] people even though they're God's people
[19:13] and even though we're God's people you
[19:15] can be their elect your elect didn't
[19:18] mean that they were immune to problems
[19:21] didn't immun didn't mean that they're
[19:23] immune to come even coming into
[19:25] captivity and doing wrong and and so the
[19:29] time that uh you remember when Samuel
[19:32] was just a young boy and he came and I
[19:35] want you young people especially I'm
[19:37] going to I'm going to on Sunday I'm
[19:38] going to be speaking Lord willing
[19:41] regarding Josiah and a very young man
[19:45] came to the throne at 8 years old and at
[19:49] when in his 16th year when he was just
[19:51] 16 years old he just did some I don't
[19:54] want to even get into it but he he was a
[19:56] phenomenal young man and had a great
[19:59] heart for God and so that's that's why
[20:02] his his heart was certainly prepared to
[20:04] serve God but now Eli had become an aged
[20:07] man Samuel had just come in and was left
[20:11] by his mother in the
[20:12] temple to serve God God made himself
[20:16] known to Samuel told Eli that the end of
[20:19] his ministry essentially was at hand and
[20:22] as we move through and I don't know how
[20:24] many years actually I didn't go to
[20:26] research at all how many years actually
[20:28] went by but then Israel came into a came
[20:32] into a war with the Philistines and the
[20:35] Philistines came against them and had a
[20:39] great Slaughter the Bible says
[20:43] 30,000
[20:45] footmen died in that battle 30,000 men
[20:49] of Israel of God's people now you can
[20:52] imagine what they're thinking at this
[20:54] time and the two sons of Samuel are
[20:58] slain because they had also they were
[21:01] they were Wicked and they were both
[21:05] slain and the Ark of God was
[21:08] taken a man escaped and ran back and
[21:13] told the people in the in the city that
[21:16] what had happened there's been a
[21:18] terrible Slaughter the ark has been
[21:20] taken the two sons of Eli have been
[21:23] killed and then Eli hears the turmoil
[21:28] and says what's happening and the
[21:29] messenger comes and tells him Eli is 98
[21:33] years old and he's a very heavy man and
[21:36] he fell over backwards and broke his
[21:38] neck and so he died this all happened in
[21:42] the same time and one of his sons finen
[21:46] house finen house I guess it is his wife
[21:49] was just giving birth to a child and she
[21:52] gave birth to this child at the news of
[21:55] hearing the Ark of God had been taken
[21:58] now now you know she was not
[22:01] so the grief that struck Eli and the
[22:04] grief that struck her was not that her
[22:08] son her husband was killed so much but
[22:11] it was that the ark was gone you know
[22:14] and that that should that should say
[22:16] something to us the glory of God when
[22:20] that departs if if if that departs from
[22:24] the
[22:24] congregation here where you gather then
[22:27] you want to be wor worried more more
[22:30] than if your loved one
[22:34] dies more than if your loved one dies
[22:38] and his her husband had been killed and
[22:43] she gave birth to this child and they
[22:45] told her to Rejoice or you know be be
[22:49] happy you've born a son and she said she
[22:53] said his name shall be ikabod the glory
[22:56] of the Lord hath Departed so all of this
[22:59] had
[23:00] transpired and Israel now the Ark of the
[23:04] word of God had gone now into the hands
[23:08] of the
[23:09] Philistines and it had been there a long
[23:11] time it actually was put in another uh
[23:14] man's house and he was kind of caretaker
[23:17] of
[23:18] it and the Bible
[23:20] says the Bible said that the the the the
[23:26] people had been Lament in they had
[23:31] lamented they you know what it means to
[23:34] L lament to to cry out to grieve and
[23:39] they had been lamenting the fact that
[23:42] the ark was in the hands and was not
[23:45] where it should be under the control and
[23:48] they were under control of the
[23:50] Philistines and the Bible says for a
[23:52] very long time for 20
[23:56] years and now we come
[23:59] and they've come to and Samuel says
[24:01] because they've lamented this and
[24:03] they've been in such grief and and and
[24:07] sorrow and so Samuel spake unto the
[24:10] house of Israel saying if you do return
[24:13] to the Lord with all your
[24:17] hearts and then put away the strange
[24:19] gods of asteroth from among you now I
[24:23] want to just bring something very very
[24:26] curious to our minds tonight into your
[24:29] mind something that can prick our
[24:31] conscience what were these elected
[24:34] people of God what was Israel doing
[24:38] lamenting and groaning and and uh
[24:42] grieving over the fact the ark is gone
[24:46] the glory of the Lord's departed and
[24:48] still have asaroth there and still have
[24:51] other gods in their house what are those
[24:54] Gods doing in their house when they've
[24:56] already recognized the glories de parted
[24:59] the glory of God is Not on Israel the
[25:01] ark isn't even here the word isn't here
[25:04] and and and with all of that still they
[25:08] have these Gods a lot of people don't
[25:10] start examining themselves until Trouble
[25:13] Comes and that is really a sad thing I I
[25:17] don't have the same confidence I've
[25:19] prayed for a lot of people that have
[25:21] been in a dying condition or or when
[25:24] they hear that uh something terminal has
[25:27] come their way and then they want to
[25:28] turn to God or or or disaster strikes
[25:31] the family or something has happened an
[25:34] accident something happens suddenly uh
[25:37] you know I'm going to lose my child
[25:39] going to lose my wife going to lose my
[25:40] husband or something and now I really
[25:42] want to get desperate with God what and
[25:44] they want to start examining themselves
[25:46] and cleaning things up why don't they do
[25:49] that ahead of
[25:51] time can you say Amen ahead of time why
[25:54] do we check out our heart ahead of time
[26:02] and he said if you will take these
[26:05] strange gods and ASO from among you and
[26:09] prepare your hearts to serve the Lord
[26:11] and serve him only and he will deliver
[26:15] you out of the hand of the Philistines
[26:17] to prepare is to be firm and stable to
[26:20] prepare your heart is not you know not
[26:24] to come to church and listen I don't
[26:25] want to belittle what we do here but to
[26:27] prepare your your heart for God isn't
[26:29] coming to the church and just having an
[26:31] extra special service it has nothing to
[26:33] do with just Clapping Your Hands has
[26:35] nothing to do with waving your hands it
[26:37] has something to do with actually
[26:39] physically doing something you examine
[26:41] your agenda you say I'm far too busy I
[26:45] don't have prayer time I don't have time
[26:48] with the word I don't have time to
[26:50] worship God uh Satan is encroaching on
[26:54] my life and I've got to make some
[26:57] changes actually make some
[27:05] changes to prepar is to be firm and to
[27:07] be stable to be established and to be
[27:10] ready and to arrange
[27:13] now this is my question to
[27:16] you and I I mentioned I mentioned
[27:21] what
[27:23] uh daddy Seymour who was the black
[27:26] brother who was the pastor of ruza
[27:29] Street I just mentioned it here
[27:32] casually when he saw that the Holy
[27:35] Spirit was falling on
[27:37] people and they were filled with the
[27:40] Holy Ghost and began to speak in unknown
[27:44] tongues and he had not received it he
[27:48] began to pray and they said in this book
[27:52] what I'm reading that he set himself
[27:55] aside and prayed for five hours a day
[27:58] now you may not have that I'm just
[28:00] saying what he did not bringing a
[28:02] condemnation on you because you don't I
[28:04] don't have five hours a day set aside
[28:06] praying but he had five hours a day just
[28:09] set aside and
[28:11] prayed and when I read
[28:14] that and and and as God was dealing with
[28:17] me and I was thinking about the stirring
[28:20] that has taking place I'm feeling that
[28:22] stirring I'm saying Lord what are you
[28:25] wanting to say to us what are you
[28:26] wanting to do in our church church and I
[28:29] don't believe it's just to you know just
[28:31] to come and do exactly the same that we
[28:34] always did I believe God can take
[28:36] control of a service I believe that
[28:37] Supernatural things uh and so then it
[28:41] just struck me and I thought if that man
[28:45] did that and rearranged his life
[28:49] rearranged his schedule and put so much
[28:53] importance on receiving the gift of the
[28:55] Holy Spirit what should we be doing if
[28:59] we actually believe that we're on the
[29:02] very that we are the people to enter
[29:04] into the
[29:05] Rapture what kind of preparation should
[29:09] you and I be making if we actually
[29:12] believe that we're a Rapture
[29:16] crowd and I think if that was
[29:18] superimposed on your mind every single
[29:21] person here young and
[29:23] old a Rapture may take place at any time
[29:28] at any moment just at what state do you
[29:31] want to be in when that happens and
[29:34] that's the state you want to live from
[29:37] morning till night all your waking time
[29:41] preparation for
[29:48] Rapture and he said uh Samuel said to
[29:51] the people that you'll prepare your
[29:54] hearts
[29:57] now I always hesitate if I feel any uh
[30:01] little illness or something that comes
[30:03] by I don't always like to mention it
[30:05] because I have a a whole Myriad of of
[30:09] remedies that are brought to me
[30:12] sometimes they're on my steps my porch
[30:14] at the house and I get them and I have
[30:17] all kind you you need this you need this
[30:19] kind of thing you need that kind of
[30:20] thing and so that's why I said one time
[30:23] here not long ago thank you I'm taking
[30:25] them all
[30:29] and I sure HED there wasn't anything to
[30:30] fight with the other the other substance
[30:33] that I was taking if there was any
[30:35] substance abuse I was I could have been
[30:39] I could have been charged because I was
[30:40] taking it all this got to be good this
[30:43] people took a glug glug these pills
[30:45] that's got to be good I mean I was
[30:49] vitamed there isn't such a word there is
[30:53] now but some of these they said you know
[30:56] what you need to get all that poison out
[30:58] of your system you need this cleansing
[31:01] you need this cleansing stuff and I tell
[31:04] you some of that just stuff is
[31:06] vile it's just
[31:08] Wicked and you I said no I don't feel
[31:12] that bad inside I just can't feel that
[31:15] bad but when I think people are so
[31:17] obsessed and just cleansing themselves
[31:19] and getting all the poison out and just
[31:22] feel it coming out of their pores and my
[31:24] they're getting so healthy I got
[31:27] thinking that really what Samuel was
[31:28] saying get all this out of your heart
[31:31] get all this poison out of your heart
[31:33] get all these ill desires out of your
[31:35] heart get all this uh false worship out
[31:38] of your heart get it all out of your
[31:40] heart cleanse it and prepare yourself
[31:43] that's establish yourself stay with it
[31:46] it's not a flash in a pan we have it
[31:48] today and then we forget about it
[31:50] tomorrow and oh I'm going to get real
[31:52] spiritual now and oh really serve God
[31:54] and then two weeks down the road forgot
[31:56] what we even said no I think we ought to
[31:59] stay with our vow stay with our change
[32:02] our course and stay with it can you say
[32:07] Amen an internal
[32:10] cleansing washing is needed I really
[32:13] believe that I say that for myself for
[32:17] my my home my wife my family because
[32:20] we're speaking about it between
[32:23] ourselves my wife and I have had a lot
[32:25] of
[32:26] conversation and I just think that you
[32:29] know we want to be responsive to the
[32:32] spirit of
[32:42] God
[32:47] now the Rapture just for a
[32:53] moment
[32:55] Jesus was on Mount Transfiguration the
[32:58] disciples
[33:01] sought and he spoke about the place
[33:04] we're going
[33:05] to the Apostle Paul the first church age
[33:09] messenger he said he'd been there been
[33:12] up to the third heaven he saw things
[33:14] that was not legal not possible to
[33:21] describe our messenger brother brandham
[33:24] went beyond the curtain of time
[33:27] describes it in quite detail and you can
[33:31] read it and I think if you haven't read
[33:35] it it's incumbent upon you to read it
[33:39] because I don't see you know I I just
[33:41] don't see how a person
[33:43] can really prepare themselves become
[33:46] serious with something if we're not
[33:47] serious enough to say well that's that's
[33:50] where I'm going you know soon as I soon
[33:53] as I find an that I'm going to take a a
[33:56] certain journey to a certain place I try
[33:58] to find out I try to find out what kind
[34:00] of weather is going to be there because
[34:03] I want to know what we're going to wear
[34:05] I want to try to find out what kind of
[34:07] accommodation is there I want to find
[34:10] out what kind of uh you know roads or
[34:12] who's going to pick us up or I want to
[34:14] have those things in place because I I
[34:17] just shouldn't have less surprises than
[34:21] more and I'm going to come back to that
[34:23] in just a moment but to have Jesus to
[34:25] speak about it the Apostle Paul to speak
[34:27] about it and then the messenger to this
[34:29] hour and
[34:30] God you know this was one of the things
[34:33] brother Brandon referred back to beyond
[34:35] the curtain of time and he speaks about
[34:38] uh I was reading today and I'm just I'm
[34:42] I'm wanting to be a little bit careful
[34:43] because I don't want to crowd in on on
[34:44] Sunday service but he was speaking
[34:47] about just when his wife passed away and
[34:51] there was his little girl Sharon Rose
[34:55] deporting and he just he just beside
[34:58] himself and he said actually he said
[35:02] that it was his
[35:04] Gethsemane he was being tore to Pieces
[35:09] inside he was going through a Gethsemane
[35:12] and calling out to God and Satan
[35:14] standing right there and said you've
[35:16] prayed and now now where's your prayers
[35:19] now where is he when youve prayed now
[35:21] you're calling on him you're asking him
[35:24] you're pleading with him not to take
[35:26] your baby and he won't hear hear you now
[35:29] where is your God and he said he went
[35:31] through his Geth
[35:32] samon and he laid his hand on a little
[35:35] one and
[35:36] said the lord giveth and the lord taketh
[35:39] away but blessed be the name of the Lord
[35:43] you see sometimes in life we're not
[35:45] we're not really prepared to to go
[35:49] through those things but my point now is
[35:51] that I don't
[35:54] believe that we should suddenly get
[35:57] sincere when something like that
[35:58] happened he had already committed
[36:01] himself he already was on course and he
[36:05] was going to go through with it even if
[36:07] Satan met him right in his Gethsemane
[36:11] nothing's going to change because this
[36:13] is way I have set my sails I've set my
[36:16] course and this is the direction I'm
[36:21] going Paul said these
[36:24] words he said to Timothy for I'm now
[36:27] ready to be offered and the time of my
[36:30] departure is at hand I have fought a
[36:33] good fight I have finished my course and
[36:36] I have kept the faith henceforth there
[36:39] is laid up for me a crown of
[36:42] righteousness which the Lord the
[36:43] righteous judge shall give give me at
[36:47] that day and not only not not to me only
[36:51] but unto them all them who also love his
[36:56] appearing mighty departure I'm I'm I'm
[36:59] getting ready to depart he's saying and
[37:01] this departure he's being loosed this
[37:05] departure it's he said it's like in the
[37:08] Greek it's like a ship being loosed from
[37:10] its Moorings the ropes have been let go
[37:13] and it's it can it can go onto its it
[37:16] can go uh it can go now on its Journey
[37:21] it also is not only to be un loosed but
[37:25] to depart from life or or to to be
[37:29] released from bonds but this is what I
[37:31] really like it is to dismiss
[37:34] laws to be loosed to be dismissed our
[37:39] Rapture is where the laws of gravity
[37:42] will lose their hold our Rapture is
[37:46] where the laws of mortality will lose
[37:49] their grip our Rapture is where the
[37:52] things that we so contend with will be
[37:55] gone our rapture is where Satan's death
[37:59] Reigns in these bodies but our Rapture
[38:02] is where the law of death will cease to
[38:06] exist and there'll be it'll have no
[38:09] power it'll have no hold upon us anymore
[38:13] and we are so gripped by so many laws
[38:16] today and those laws will be broken in
[38:18] other words our Rapture is the
[38:20] dismissing of those laws and when I see
[38:23] the greatness of this event I just think
[38:26] and I want to say to you honestly I just
[38:28] think that myself and we all should look
[38:32] on it much more
[38:33] seriously and when you hear when you
[38:36] hear the message and you and you hear
[38:39] that discernment or that more than
[38:42] discernment you hear the word revealing
[38:44] the secret of the heart and remember
[38:47] I've spoken here in the last few weeks
[38:49] that is the sign of the
[38:53] Resurrection we have had in this
[38:55] generation the sign of the Resurrection
[38:57] C and when that happens don't get taken
[38:59] up with brother Brown calling a certain
[39:01] person by name etc etc I heard one today
[39:04] and and I I just marvel at it but all
[39:07] the time every time I hear it I say the
[39:09] sign of the Resurrection God is showing
[39:12] I don't know what it means to other
[39:14] people but he's showing me the sign of
[39:16] the resurrection and if a soul with such
[39:20] a a a special and so potent and so
[39:24] powerfully Vindicated this voice
[39:27] by the sign of the resurrection and the
[39:29] sign of the
[39:32] Messiah it should have a great deal of
[39:34] significance to us to a people that us
[39:38] are are believing it a great deal of
[39:40] significance we say the sign of the
[39:42] Resurrection The Sign of the
[39:44] Resurrection has been here for all these
[39:46] years now and the sign of the
[39:48] Resurrection this Christ has has spoken
[39:53] has spoken so clearly there shouldn't be
[39:56] any mistake
[39:57] there shouldn't be any restraint on our
[40:01] part to believe it and he said if you
[40:03] believe it you do
[40:10] it scripture says for the law of the
[40:12] spirit of life in Christ Jesus hath made
[40:16] us free from the law of sin and
[40:21] death so I asked the question what
[40:25] preparation should we be making
[40:29] for our departure you might say what
[40:33] happens if it doesn't then what happens
[40:35] if it doesn't happen let me tell you you
[40:37] didn't waste your
[40:40] time let me tell you you'll never regret
[40:42] what you
[40:45] did someone might say well we should
[40:47] take an examination of ourselves
[40:50] and uh we can look at our wardrobe and
[40:54] watch how we dress and watch how we
[40:56] speak and
[40:57] oh you
[41:00] know I said to my wife coming here
[41:03] sometimes I bounce things off her I said
[41:05] you know in the scripture they had such
[41:08] a
[41:09] cleansing uh that they even had the
[41:11] priests go and uh check out the homes
[41:15] take all these Gods out so I thought I
[41:17] wonder what the people would say I said
[41:19] to my wife what would the people say
[41:20] said now uh you folks this is the word
[41:23] of God and we're going to come in and
[41:25] check and make sure there's nothing no
[41:26] evil gods in there if we find any DVDs
[41:30] or any you know uh uh some of these CDs
[41:34] and some of the stuff that shouldn't be
[41:36] there and you can come and check my home
[41:38] out if you want some magazine some book
[41:41] we'll just check it out you'll say
[41:44] that's my home I'd say that's Leo DEA
[41:47] that you say people's rights you don't
[41:49] have any right to my home in the Bible
[41:50] they had a right they walked right in
[41:52] and said hey out this goes fact is I'll
[41:55] do you a favor I'll burn it
[42:03] you almost sound like you agree with
[42:05] that
[42:14] Hallelujah we we can say it's a you know
[42:17] it's a simple thing you don't mind if I
[42:19] just take my time with you here this
[42:20] evening we can say well it's just really
[42:22] a simple thing but you know
[42:24] the while that happened on on one
[42:27] scripture which I don't want to get in
[42:28] tonight that was exactly what they did
[42:31] but now Samuel's taking it to a
[42:33] different level and that is he says you
[42:35] know turn turn with all your heart and
[42:38] the heart the heart is even more
[42:40] difficult you can come and if you found
[42:42] a if you found a piece of music or
[42:44] something in my house that you said hey
[42:46] this is out okay I'd say God bless you
[42:48] just Chuck it the sooner the better I
[42:51] didn't even know it was there okay but
[42:54] then when you come to the heart that's
[42:56] quite something it's a different thing
[42:58] now you're really treading on
[43:00] treacherous territory so well yeah but I
[43:03] had my feelings hurt oh so that gives us
[43:06] a reason to have a chip on our shoulder
[43:08] that has a reason to you know hold some
[43:11] grudge against somebody or something
[43:14] that's what we really should be checking
[43:15] out we ought to be checking out our
[43:18] heart is everything absolutely clear
[43:21] everything is all straight in our heart
[43:24] no wrong desires there no wrong feelings
[43:30] there well it's a little bit quieter
[43:32] than the last time but I still think
[43:34] that you I still think that you're
[43:37] agreeing brother Brenham said in the
[43:39] message sir we would see Jesus he said
[43:41] if you're a housewife or you're a
[43:43] preacher or you're a deacon or whatever
[43:46] you are in the sight of God we're all
[43:49] the same we're just children each one of
[43:52] us has a job to do so let's do it with
[43:55] all all of our heart so I'm not speaking
[43:58] to some you know great spiritual leaders
[44:02] or someone that has a high-profile in a
[44:04] church I don't care what you are I don't
[44:07] care I don't care you know what you
[44:09] think your position is it's all
[44:12] important to Prophet says we're all
[44:15] children there isn't a housewife here
[44:18] that is to be considered less than a
[44:20] deacon it's a different office but it's
[44:23] a great office if you're a farmer be the
[44:25] best farmer if you're a carpenter be the
[44:28] best Carpenter whatever God has has has
[44:31] led you into be the very best if you're
[44:34] a student in school be the best student
[44:36] in school is there anything wrong with
[44:38] that and to live righteously and to live
[44:40] holy and to live Godly you'll never
[44:43] regret
[44:49] that
[44:51] now there was a one woman brother brand
[44:54] spoke to and he said one brother rather
[44:56] and he says well brother dear he said
[44:59] you are suffering and I see a doctor
[45:02] before you and you've just been examined
[45:06] and I believe you're up for an operation
[45:08] now this is a sign of the Resurrection
[45:11] it's not just some you know discernment
[45:14] or revealing the secret of his heart he
[45:15] said you're figuring on an operation
[45:18] right
[45:19] away say he
[45:22] stops I feel though you've made
[45:25] preparations for something else
[45:27] else you've just been saved
[45:32] too just converted it's been recently
[45:37] this man although he was sick but he
[45:41] determined to make some other
[45:43] preparations said I need to get right
[45:45] with God I need to get saved and be
[45:48] converted and he said you've made that
[45:50] preparation you've just been saved
[45:52] you've been converted just recently
[45:54] because he said you had on the same same
[45:57] suit of
[45:59] clothes the same suit of clothes he's
[46:01] standing in there he said you had that
[46:03] same suit of clothes on when you gave
[46:05] your life to
[46:06] Christ I like that kind of a prophet
[46:09] don't you and he said isn't that right
[46:12] he said well don't you fear the
[46:14] operation brother because Jesus Christ
[46:17] the son of God has made a preparation
[46:20] for
[46:21] you Hallelujah I just thought that was
[46:25] so lovely you made a preparation in your
[46:28] heart and you gave your life to Christ
[46:31] and you surrendered it and you became a
[46:33] Christian you became converted you made
[46:35] a
[46:36] preparation don't have any fear Jesus
[46:39] made a preparation for you I say that is
[46:42] so wonderful that's a blessed thought I
[46:45] could actually close on that thought but
[46:47] I'm quite a from it
[46:50] yet the scripture Paul said in the
[46:53] Hebrews he said but you are come to
[46:55] Mount Zion you might wonder why I'm
[46:57] saying this now but you've come to Mount
[46:59] Zion and un the city of the Living God
[47:02] the heavenly Jerusalem and to an
[47:05] innumerable company of
[47:07] angels John said in Revelation 14 he
[47:11] said and I looked and lo a lamb stood on
[47:13] Mount Zion and with him 144,000 having
[47:18] his father's name written in their
[47:21] forehead Apostle Paul says you've come
[47:24] to Mount Zion you're not at Mount
[47:27] Si you're not at Mount Nebo where where
[47:32] the Prophet Moses was taken you're not
[47:35] at Mount Carmel where uh Elijah met and
[47:39] challenged Israel we're not even at
[47:42] Mount
[47:43] Transfiguration we're not at Mount
[47:45] olives we're not at Mount Calvary but we
[47:48] are at Mount Zion that and the prophet
[47:51] said that's where the word proceeds from
[47:53] we are there and if you haven't
[47:57] uh I'm sure you have but you you realize
[48:00] that you're where the word is proceeding
[48:02] from God and you say I was so blessed
[48:06] because you've come to Mount Zion you've
[48:08] come to a location you've come to a
[48:11] place where God's word is proceeding
[48:14] from and I got thinking today and I hope
[48:16] you don't think I'm out of line I got
[48:18] thinking today we're going up a mountain
[48:21] that young people have sang a song I'm
[48:22] climbing up up the Rough Side of the
[48:25] Mountain I don't know if I like all the
[48:26] words to that because uh it might be the
[48:29] Rough Side of the Mountain but it's not
[48:31] that I'm just trying to make my way to
[48:33] God or I might find my way to God I'm
[48:36] Mount our Mountain that we're coming up
[48:38] is a mountain where we keep hearing the
[48:40] word so I got thinking about
[48:43] the mountain
[48:46] climbing we're climbing a mountain and
[48:50] so I thought I just came to my mind I
[48:53] hope you don't think it's too juvenile I
[48:55] thought oh these people that climb
[48:59] mountains uh and I see pictures of the
[49:02] National Geographic and they're up there
[49:04] on top of some Peak and almost being
[49:06] blown right off the top to you know put
[49:09] the flag of their Nation there or put
[49:12] some identification that and and so many
[49:15] are asked why do you climb the mountain
[49:17] and many of them say well because it's
[49:19] there I've heard that I've read it so
[49:21] many times because it's there that's why
[49:22] I climb it I've climbed enough mountains
[49:25] I climbed some with with brother
[49:26] brandham and there were some pretty
[49:28] treacherous places and I don't I don't
[49:30] particularly have any you know
[49:33] any special desire to climb a mountain
[49:36] and risk my
[49:37] life but I I I've read some very
[49:40] interesting things about some of these
[49:41] people I got thinking about so I just
[49:43] want to see what do they do to prepare
[49:46] to climb a
[49:48] mountain what do they do to prepare to
[49:51] climb Mount
[49:53] Everest and so I Googled that you all
[49:56] know what that that is and the first
[49:58] thing I hit was a big long list you
[50:01] don't have enough time for me to read
[50:03] the list that they're going to prepare
[50:07] just their preparation to climb old
[50:10] Mount Everest that's a bunch of ashes
[50:13] and
[50:14] rock and I thought these people they
[50:18] they give themselves so completely to
[50:21] climb this Earthly mountain and here we
[50:24] are and we either Believe It Or we don't
[50:26] don't believe it that we are we are
[50:29] preparing for a change of this body for
[50:32] a transformation of this flesh into an
[50:36] Immortal Realm there's a there's another
[50:39] body that's waiting for us this all been
[50:41] told us we have a prophet you have a
[50:42] prophet said I've been
[50:45] there I pinched my hand did he say it I
[50:48] bit my finger did he say it he said I
[50:51] looked at my body it was only 20 25 ft
[50:54] away or less did he say it said it he
[50:57] was actually there now the question is
[51:00] do you really plan to go there and the
[51:02] next question is what preparation are we
[51:04] making to
[51:06] God what preparation are we making for
[51:08] this event oh I think I can just toot
[51:11] along just keep coming to church you
[51:12] know what I mean and and the rest of my
[51:14] time is all taken up just for the world
[51:16] and for my life here and all the rest of
[51:18] it and I'm not I'm not condemning that
[51:20] I'm just saying to you maybe we should
[51:22] open up our heart and open up our whole
[51:24] minds and say what is this all about and
[51:27] is there actually some preparation that
[51:29] I should be
[51:33] making so here's just a little bit of
[51:37] it there's some essential
[51:41] equipment oxygen
[51:44] canisters 5 to S 31
[51:48] bottles a sack to collect ice and snow
[51:51] for melting and wet wipes for the
[51:54] washing of your body they freeze so you
[51:58] need to sleep with them inside your tent
[52:02] and if they're going to be of any use
[52:04] you also need a satellite phone and a
[52:07] two-way radio a two-way radio and some
[52:11] foot powder hey this is just the first
[52:14] little
[52:15] paragraph I got thinking the mountain
[52:18] we're climbing on I think you know a lot
[52:21] of a lot of people don't don't don't get
[52:23] me wrong but I think a lot of people
[52:25] your cell phone works a lot better than
[52:26] your two-way radio up
[52:29] above I see people on the cell phone all
[52:32] the time their cell phone works just
[52:33] great but he ask them to
[52:37] pray and they have a
[52:40] struggle what do I say talk like you
[52:43] talk on the cell phone who do you talk
[52:45] to on the cell phone well I talk to my
[52:47] friend well this is your god this is
[52:49] your father having any trouble talking
[52:51] to your
[52:52] father I got Tongue Tied well it's time
[52:55] to get your tongue Loos up say well this
[52:58] is a strange message you want to believe
[53:01] it is but it's absolutely right on
[53:04] target there should be nothing wrong
[53:06] with our two-way radio if you plan to
[53:08] climb this mountain if you plan to have
[53:10] a change of the body we got to have a
[53:13] good
[53:17] connection frequent connection
[53:29] believe it or not I'm going to give you
[53:31] some quotes as we go
[53:33] along in the message hear his voice
[53:36] brother brandham says to us if you want
[53:39] something from God ask
[53:42] him then stand still number two number
[53:46] three and
[53:49] listen to see what he's going to say
[53:52] about it just open up your heart number
[53:55] four
[53:57] and say number five what about it Lord
[54:03] Jesus oh you're
[54:06] quiet this is so deep it's so
[54:10] profound you might Escape it or it might
[54:13] Escape you it's so simple and that's the
[54:18] problem if you want something from God
[54:21] what's the first
[54:23] one ask him now number two then stand
[54:30] still often we're in a great nervous
[54:33] flurry because we need an answer from
[54:35] God oh I need an answer from God we're
[54:36] all tensed up that's not the way we get
[54:39] an answer from God ask
[54:42] him here's one who got a lot of answers
[54:45] from God someone is giving us real
[54:47] counsel ask him then stand
[54:53] still next listen
[54:58] and see what he's going to say about it
[55:01] and just open up your
[55:03] heart What About It Lord Jesus just stay
[55:06] there if he doesn't answer you in the
[55:09] first five hours you know what the next
[55:12] line is then wait
[55:14] another if he doesn't answer today then
[55:18] he'll answer tomorrow and if he doesn't
[55:21] answer this week he will answer next
[55:23] week stay there till he answered
[55:33] amen the Bible says let us draw near
[55:36] with a True Heart in full Assurance of
[55:38] Faith having your heart
[55:40] sprinkled from an evil conscience and
[55:43] our bodies washed with pure water in
[55:46] Ephesians then he might s that that he
[55:49] might sanctify and cleanse it with the
[55:51] washing of the Water by the word in
[55:54] Ephesians in the Ephesians parallels
[55:57] Joshua now we're speaking about brother
[55:59] Braham speaking about their journey and
[56:01] their inheriting the promised land and
[56:04] he says that's where the believer comes
[56:07] he comes first to a recognition that
[56:09] he's a sinner then he's separated by the
[56:12] waters the washing of the Water by the
[56:14] word Believing on the Lord Jesus Christ
[56:17] then being justified by faith he becomes
[56:20] a partaker and at peace with God through
[56:23] Christ baptized into the name of Jesus
[56:26] Christ to put him into the
[56:29] journey you get it he said into the
[56:33] journey then he becomes a souljourner
[56:36] and a pilgrim he's on his journey to
[56:39] what a promise that God made him now
[56:43] this took on such such new uh depth for
[56:48] me as I just read some of these things
[56:50] that seemed maybe so utterly
[56:52] simple but you know when I read the
[56:56] instructions of this experienced
[56:59] experienced climber who's climbed I
[57:02] think almost every Mountain over 8,000
[57:04] ft he's climbed so many mountains and
[57:07] he's giving them instruction and and and
[57:09] he lets them know there'll be a time
[57:11] when you can't even really wash your
[57:13] body because it is so cold it is so
[57:17] bitter and you've got to prepare
[57:19] yourself so you can have some hygiene
[57:22] and some cleanliness and here's people
[57:24] just climbing a pile of Rock
[57:26] for the sake that it's there and here we
[57:29] are coming to church on a Wednesday
[57:31] night we're coming on a Sunday twice and
[57:34] we're giving ourselves during the week
[57:36] and to hear the word of the Lord I
[57:39] say is there anything further that we
[57:41] ought to
[57:46] do there is there indeed is and I think
[57:50] that we ought to take real inventory and
[57:53] say when God deals with you see I don't
[57:57] know how many I know that there's some
[57:59] because I've spoken to you you said I
[58:03] have sensed I have felt God doing
[58:06] something different with me I have felt
[58:09] that stir I have felt that wind of the
[58:14] holy spirit it's different these last
[58:17] services or the last six months or the
[58:19] last year I've had different things said
[58:22] to me some said in the last year it's
[58:24] been so different in the last six month
[58:26] month the last message is wherever it is
[58:29] and whatever time it is and whatever
[58:31] Junction it is and wherever it is all
[58:33] I'm saying to you because we're all
[58:35] different for me it might be one time
[58:37] for you it might be another but when
[58:39] that moment arrives and it might be
[58:41] tonight say God is speaking to me in a
[58:44] very special way I say then turn to him
[58:48] with all your heart and say God what do
[58:50] you want me to do search my heart oh God
[58:54] can you say Amen
[58:58] here these
[59:01] people and then they they go now into
[59:04] the
[59:05] food the kind of food you have to have
[59:09] for this kind of a journey this isn't
[59:12] walking just you know sightseeing they
[59:15] want to
[59:17] climb uh a record
[59:21] Mountain says their food mostly boil in
[59:26] the bag meals as well as plenty of
[59:29] biscuits and
[59:33] chocolate brother brandham said
[59:36] this it's not what Noah did it's not
[59:39] what Moses did their examples we see and
[59:43] read what they did but it's what he
[59:47] promised to do now he was he was the
[59:51] word back there he was the carcass for
[59:54] that day the day of Wesley was a carcass
[59:57] for that day the day of Luther was a
[59:59] carcass for that day we've got fresh
[1:00:02] food today and my friends I don't
[1:00:06] believe that it should be ever a stale
[1:00:09] meal I believe you ought to have fresh
[1:00:12] Mana we pray that in the in the study
[1:00:15] before we feed the sheep feed the sheep
[1:00:19] give them water to drink from the from
[1:00:22] the fountain fresh water to drink and
[1:00:24] give them a thirst for it
[1:00:27] let's not come to the house of God so
[1:00:29] encumbered and our mind so fogged in we
[1:00:32] ought to prepare ourselves when we come
[1:00:35] here to the house of God brother brandom
[1:00:37] said clearly you ought to come and sit
[1:00:39] quiet and read the Bible or pray or come
[1:00:41] to the front and just kneel quietly and
[1:00:43] prepare
[1:00:46] ourselves now you
[1:00:49] know the hallways are
[1:00:51] full you know that the ladies are
[1:00:54] chatting with the children
[1:00:56] you know that the young people they all
[1:00:58] got things to do and they're sitting out
[1:01:00] there and those are just little physical
[1:01:03] things and is that the thing to do to
[1:01:06] prepare for the word of God I say no
[1:01:09] it's not the thing to do you can get as
[1:01:11] quiet as you want I think you ought to
[1:01:13] be in here getting your heart ready for
[1:01:15] the word of God and then when you come
[1:01:17] in here and say well you know that
[1:01:19] service wasn't really what it ought to
[1:01:21] be thanks to some of
[1:01:23] you not thanks to the minister who's
[1:01:25] been waiting hours and hours on God and
[1:01:28] in prayer and the brothers waiting on
[1:01:30] God and our whole mind is focused I've
[1:01:33] spent hours and hours just even today
[1:01:37] perhaps six hours today just to wait on
[1:01:39] God to come and to study and and and
[1:01:42] leave my wife alone leave other things
[1:01:44] aside try not to even answer the phones
[1:01:47] to come here and get ready now I that's
[1:01:49] a kind of preparation I have to go
[1:01:51] through I I don't get here I'm not here
[1:01:53] to exercise myself I'm not here just to
[1:01:56] you know to give a
[1:01:58] speech there's a lot heavier Duty on
[1:02:00] that if I believe the message and I
[1:02:02] believe that we need to come and
[1:02:04] fellowship around the body word of the
[1:02:07] son of man and there's a such a solemn
[1:02:09] Duty on us standing here behind the
[1:02:11] pulpit to bring forth the word of the
[1:02:14] hour of this day that's why I say with
[1:02:17] such an emphasis when you read these
[1:02:19] things when you hear those things what
[1:02:21] what they call the Discerning of the I
[1:02:24] heard a a brother say that when we were
[1:02:26] there the gift of discernment the gift
[1:02:28] of discernment and I got up and spoke
[1:02:30] and I said you know it it wasn't
[1:02:32] discernment it was the word coming forth
[1:02:35] out of a vessel out of a prophet's mouth
[1:02:37] it wasn't just discernment friend what
[1:02:40] we had when he says to says to a woman
[1:02:43] you reason why you're troubled is you
[1:02:46] got cancer and it's in your mouth and
[1:02:47] it's on the left side of your mouth I'm
[1:02:49] telling this is specific and that isn't
[1:02:52] just telling her that for her for her
[1:02:54] satisfaction it was telling her that so
[1:02:56] she would know God was there God knew
[1:02:59] what her case was God was on on the
[1:03:01] scene and we should be saying when you
[1:03:04] hear that you say that's a sign of to me
[1:03:06] that's a sign of the resurrection and
[1:03:08] when you see the sign of the
[1:03:09] Resurrection then you know that's the
[1:03:11] sign of the Rapture and how can we have
[1:03:13] this sign after sign after sign over and
[1:03:16] over and over again emphasize and sit
[1:03:19] here and not be aware the Rapture could
[1:03:21] take place we could have the change of
[1:03:23] the body The Sweep could happen you say
[1:03:25] what if it doesn't happen you'll be
[1:03:27] better off being prepared for
[1:03:30] it you'll never regret being prepared
[1:03:33] for it if it's long gone you live your
[1:03:35] whole life out you say I'm so glad I
[1:03:37] heard those messages I'm so glad that
[1:03:40] our pastor spoke with such a with such
[1:03:43] force and such a burden on his heart
[1:03:45] that it changed my order of my life
[1:03:49] you'll never regret it you say I heard
[1:03:52] those services and I set myself in
[1:03:54] motion I did certain things I searched
[1:03:57] out my heart I searched out my home I
[1:03:59] searched out the order of things in my
[1:04:01] life and it
[1:04:02] changed because of what I heard and
[1:04:05] you'll thank God for it and we'll meet
[1:04:07] on the other side hug one another and
[1:04:10] you'll be thankful for it and I'll be
[1:04:11] thankful
[1:04:13] too amen
[1:04:16] hallelujah
[1:04:22] hallelujah it's the food for this hour
[1:04:26] I like this one you got to have some
[1:04:29] climbing
[1:04:30] apparatus if you're going to get any
[1:04:32] higher you got to have some climbing
[1:04:35] apparatus and this man says they had to
[1:04:38] have harness and an ice pick and and
[1:04:41] some other things and a clip device and
[1:04:43] etc etc and a rope and they said and
[1:04:46] he's explained to the people it moves
[1:04:48] forward but not backwards I thought
[1:04:51] praise God that's exactly the kind of
[1:04:54] apparatus you and I know need something
[1:04:56] that moves forward and helps us get
[1:04:58] higher but won't let us come
[1:05:01] down I'm hooked into
[1:05:04] something we're hooked into
[1:05:07] something won't let us go praise the
[1:05:10] Lord praise the
[1:05:18] Lord you need your feet Shaw with the
[1:05:22] preparation of the gospel of peace just
[1:05:26] a few more minutes but I got a little
[1:05:27] ways to go
[1:05:29] quickly
[1:05:31] clothes you're going up into some severe
[1:05:35] violent weather clothing how you're
[1:05:38] robed is
[1:05:40] critical let me tell you
[1:05:42] friends how we're robed is critical
[1:05:46] too and I
[1:05:48] saw the angel said come and I'll show
[1:05:50] you the bride the I'll show you the
[1:05:53] Lamb's wife and it was given to her that
[1:05:56] she was
[1:05:57] arrayed in fine
[1:06:00] linen friends let me say something to
[1:06:03] you I don't want this to sound like a
[1:06:06] Works service message but there is some
[1:06:08] Works
[1:06:11] involved it does not
[1:06:14] say if you are faithful and you attend
[1:06:17] Cloverdale Bible Way and you're a
[1:06:21] good solid citizen and a good believer
[1:06:24] and you enter into fellowship and you
[1:06:27] pay your tithe and you've done all that
[1:06:29] you've just been faithful All Through
[1:06:31] The Years while that's important it
[1:06:34] doesn't say that that is how we get
[1:06:36] dressed and AR raid in fine linen the
[1:06:39] fine linen is the righteousness of the
[1:06:43] Saints and the Bible says that our
[1:06:45] Father
[1:06:46] Abraham it was granted to him he was
[1:06:51] counted righteous because he believed
[1:06:54] God and I have done some study I've
[1:06:57] mentioned it before I want you to listen
[1:06:58] real close this linen they said that
[1:07:02] linen they have such fine linen that has
[1:07:06] come out of the out of the Far East out
[1:07:09] of the Middle East rather they said that
[1:07:11] the linen is so fine it is so exotic and
[1:07:15] beautiful that it supersedes the price
[1:07:18] of gold in
[1:07:20] weight the linen is so costly it's so I
[1:07:24] can tell you you that the linen the fine
[1:07:28] linen that the Bride of Jesus Christ was
[1:07:30] dressed in it's very costly because it
[1:07:34] came at the hand of our hearts believing
[1:07:38] God's word and it cost something to
[1:07:41] believe the word of God it really does
[1:07:43] it costs something one man came to a
[1:07:46] minister when he had received Christ and
[1:07:49] then he was troubled and he thought that
[1:07:50] maybe he had to give it up and he said
[1:07:53] that what I'm concerned about is that
[1:07:55] this is going to cost me too much and
[1:07:58] the minister with the wisdom of God said
[1:08:00] you're exactly right it's going to cost
[1:08:02] you
[1:08:03] everything and we've got to be prepared
[1:08:05] for that it's going to cost us
[1:08:07] everything cost us everything and yet we
[1:08:10] gain
[1:08:13] everything Adam and Eve were clothed in
[1:08:15] bloody skins Aaron and his sons were
[1:08:19] clothed in Priestly robes Elijah was
[1:08:23] wrapped in a prophet's mantle
[1:08:26] other prophets and those in Repentance
[1:08:29] put on sackcloth and Ashes John the
[1:08:32] Baptist was clothed in Camel's hair the
[1:08:36] angel at the Seer the Bible says was in
[1:08:39] a long white robe Jesus on Mount
[1:08:43] Transfiguration was in a garment and the
[1:08:45] Bible says it was glistening as white as
[1:08:49] light the great Harlot she's arrayed in
[1:08:52] purple and Scarlet but the Bride of
[1:08:55] Jesus Christ is arrayed in righteousness
[1:08:59] and I'll tell you friends we're not
[1:09:00] going to get to the top of this mountain
[1:09:03] unless we have the righteousness and
[1:09:05] it's not our righteousness but there's
[1:09:07] one thing that is a criteria if we we
[1:09:11] must believe the word that is sent to us
[1:09:14] in our time believe
[1:09:16] it not a mental Ascent but believe it to
[1:09:20] a doing of it to an acting on it
[1:09:28] amen says it takes some
[1:09:31] training and I have found I've been on
[1:09:34] this way quite a long time and I don't
[1:09:36] know whether I've ever got out of the
[1:09:38] training stage it always takes some
[1:09:41] training but they said to climb this
[1:09:43] mountain you got to plan ahead I'm
[1:09:46] preaching
[1:09:47] tonight in a Ultra simplistic way and
[1:09:51] saying to this congregation I believe
[1:09:54] that God has been doing doing
[1:09:56] something
[1:09:59] special to at least some individuals and
[1:10:02] that's who I'm speaking to tonight and
[1:10:05] if it hasn't taken place with you yet it
[1:10:07] may be tonight it may be Sunday it may
[1:10:11] be at home maybe when you're listening
[1:10:14] to a message it may be that something
[1:10:17] just begins to stir and you say this is
[1:10:19] different it's different
[1:10:26] how many you felt something moving
[1:10:29] different with
[1:10:32] you I'm pleasantly
[1:10:37] surprised I've had a lot a lot of you
[1:10:39] have
[1:10:42] spoken and that's why I'm coming from
[1:10:45] this
[1:10:47] direction God wants us to take a visible
[1:10:53] step you might not even know right now
[1:10:57] what is it that I should do and I asked
[1:10:59] myself while I was studying this what is
[1:11:00] it the people are going to wonder what
[1:11:02] what should we
[1:11:06] do I just talked to you very personally
[1:11:09] now Sister Ruth and I talked on the
[1:11:14] plane we talked again
[1:11:17] today he said I just think there are
[1:11:20] things I began to think of what brother
[1:11:21] brandom said you know when we see he
[1:11:24] talked about people seeing the end of
[1:11:25] their life and I'm not talking about the
[1:11:27] end of the life I'm talking about the
[1:11:29] departure from this place into another
[1:11:32] realm and I I I have to be honest with
[1:11:34] you if this was my last service I'd have
[1:11:36] to tell you I do not believe just coming
[1:11:39] here sitting here enjoying the meeting
[1:11:40] clapping our hand listen to the song
[1:11:42] leader listen to good service go on home
[1:11:44] and enjoy you know the ABC restaurant or
[1:11:47] Starbucks or something else I don't
[1:11:49] believe that's the ritual I don't
[1:11:51] believe that's the order of the day not
[1:11:54] that there's anything wrong with those
[1:11:55] things but I just I believe that there
[1:11:57] needs to be a tightening up and we turn
[1:12:00] ourselves and index ourselves around and
[1:12:02] just say
[1:12:05] I I will give my mind to think on these
[1:12:09] Eternal things
[1:12:12] more I
[1:12:15] will I I'll I'll take I'll take some
[1:12:18] real quality time and I'm going to
[1:12:21] listen I'm going to and and I would
[1:12:23] encourage you don't listen don't listen
[1:12:25] to the message just you know like
[1:12:29] shotgun style I believe it's real good
[1:12:32] to follow a certain order listen to them
[1:12:35] in sequence and hear what he said
[1:12:38] because he continued on with the thought
[1:12:39] all the way through this just kind of
[1:12:41] little teaching but I believe it's
[1:12:42] important and if you just turn your
[1:12:44] whole heart and index it towards the
[1:12:47] Lord and then talk to
[1:12:51] him and then
[1:12:53] listen and why while you're listening
[1:12:56] you might just feel a little twinge
[1:12:59] inside a little something you know what
[1:13:02] it didn't mean anything when you said it
[1:13:04] or didn't mean anything when you did it
[1:13:07] what happened but now it just seems to
[1:13:09] come up and it's something you know what
[1:13:13] I'm not going to let this thing stand my
[1:13:15] way I'm just going to I didn't even feel
[1:13:17] convicted about it but I'm just going to
[1:13:19] make it right I can't have it in my way
[1:13:22] I can't afford it why because we're in
[1:13:24] preparation
[1:13:25] I don't want anything if these fellas
[1:13:28] here just climbing a physical Mountain I
[1:13:31] tell you what when I read what they did
[1:13:33] I said oh God I'm even ashamed of myself
[1:13:36] as a Christian these fellas go through
[1:13:39] all of this in preparation I've not made
[1:13:41] that kind of preparation the one thing I
[1:13:44] have done and I just throw myself at the
[1:13:46] mercy of God but you know as we go
[1:13:49] on we all collect a bunch of
[1:13:52] baggage and we ought to Chuck it out
[1:13:56] we get all kinds of baggage and we ought
[1:13:58] to Chuck it
[1:14:05] out I'm just drawing to a close right
[1:14:08] now plan
[1:14:12] ahead they do all kinds of
[1:14:15] training take
[1:14:18] supplements and they speak about the
[1:14:20] health
[1:14:21] hazards and what they plan for
[1:14:25] acute Mountain sickness and Frostbite
[1:14:28] and hypothermia and broken bones and
[1:14:30] sunburn and mental preparation and don't
[1:14:33] rush your buildup and understand it
[1:14:35] won't it won't be easy be prepared for
[1:14:38] lots of downtime except that you won't
[1:14:40] be mentally alert on the mountain all
[1:14:42] kinds of things and say there's all
[1:14:44] kinds of hallucinations everything then
[1:14:46] we come and we start on this walk and we
[1:14:49] think everything's just going to be you
[1:14:51] know just easy I'm on Easy Street stre
[1:14:55] now no you're in a Warfare you're in a
[1:14:58] battle and you know when things start
[1:15:00] getting hard we don't want to
[1:15:04] whimper we don't want to whimper we
[1:15:07] don't want to
[1:15:10] complain we want to be men we want to be
[1:15:14] women and this thing turned real hard
[1:15:17] against me we ought to expect that we're
[1:15:20] on our way up a Rough Side of the
[1:15:23] Mountain I might be over overstating it
[1:15:25] but I believe it needs to be overstated
[1:15:27] right
[1:15:28] now and then last and this is where I
[1:15:33] close they said to the people to these
[1:15:36] that are planning to climb picture
[1:15:39] yourself on the mountain
[1:15:44] succeeding and I would suggest to you
[1:15:47] tonight with all the mental capabilities
[1:15:51] you have you should picture yourself
[1:15:55] having succeeded and being on the other
[1:15:58] side you should picture yourself in the
[1:16:02] in in the host of the redeemed and if
[1:16:05] you can't picture yourself there it
[1:16:08] might be that you know you just don't
[1:16:10] have the confidence that you should have
[1:16:13] but those people they've got to get
[1:16:14] pumped I'm not here to pump you tonight
[1:16:17] I'm not here to get you all in I'm here
[1:16:19] to have you just look within yourself
[1:16:22] and say and I'll I'll start you where I
[1:16:25] start all kinds of people who come in
[1:16:27] for
[1:16:28] counsel I've had people and I I'm going
[1:16:31] to just like I'm counseling the whole
[1:16:33] congregation T night they come in
[1:16:34] they're so low they're so low they're so
[1:16:38] depressed they're so defeated sometimes
[1:16:40] I think I need a scoop shovel to pick
[1:16:42] them up they are so
[1:16:45] down and as a minister and you're going
[1:16:48] to counsel them and people they're so
[1:16:50] defeated they've had so much trouble
[1:16:53] they've had so much
[1:16:55] pain and
[1:16:57] anguish you know what I ask myself
[1:16:59] because I've asked myself Lord where do
[1:17:02] I start what do we do with this case how
[1:17:06] do you start so I've learned you want
[1:17:08] one of my secrets I ask
[1:17:11] him I want to start at Ground Zero are
[1:17:15] you a Son of
[1:17:18] God are you a daughter of
[1:17:22] God and quite often I've had them say
[1:17:24] say
[1:17:28] well I'd have to say yes I said
[1:17:32] wonderful that's wonderful you are a son
[1:17:36] of God you mean you're a Son of God you
[1:17:38] really believe that I do amen well hey
[1:17:42] if you're a Son of God you don't have
[1:17:44] too many problems if you're a Son of
[1:17:47] God I said did Jesus die for
[1:17:51] you yeah he did did he take your sins
[1:17:56] yeah he
[1:17:58] did I said how much of them did he
[1:18:02] take
[1:18:04] 20%
[1:18:06] 50% 75 and this one brother he lived
[1:18:10] depressed most of his
[1:18:11] life I remember it like it was yesterday
[1:18:14] and when I started getting about 75% 80%
[1:18:18] he could see where I was going and he
[1:18:20] broke into a bit of a smile I said did
[1:18:22] he take 90% he said no he took 100% I
[1:18:25] said just a second let me get this
[1:18:27] straight you're a Son of God you're born
[1:18:31] again and Jesus Christ took 100% of your
[1:18:34] sins and you got a
[1:18:38] problem I said well then let me go a
[1:18:41] little bit
[1:18:43] further did he give you anything in
[1:18:45] exchange he took all your sins per
[1:18:48] chance did he give you his
[1:18:52] righteousness he said he did
[1:18:55] great all your sins are gone now we've
[1:18:58] got you as a Son of God you're born
[1:19:01] again and Jesus Christ has taken 100% of
[1:19:06] your
[1:19:07] sins and how much of his righteousness
[1:19:09] did he give you I start going same thing
[1:19:12] 20% no now he's now he's onto my now
[1:19:16] he's onto my you know my system no he
[1:19:19] says he gave me all his
[1:19:21] righteousness I said my goodness here
[1:19:25] sits a
[1:19:26] man that is a Son of God that has all of
[1:19:30] his sins taken and all the righteousness
[1:19:32] of Jesus Christ given to you and you got
[1:19:35] a problem he said no I don't have a
[1:19:37] problem I don't have a
[1:19:41] problem I saw that man he he had lived
[1:19:44] for years under that cloud you know
[1:19:47] something like that that sounds simple
[1:19:49] that broke that thing on him because he
[1:19:51] began to believe that and you want to
[1:19:53] believe it and if you're having trouble
[1:19:55] tonight you start saying it I am a Son
[1:19:58] of God I'm a daughter of God Jesus Took
[1:20:01] 100% of my sins Jesus gave me 100% of
[1:20:06] his righteousness and I receive it and
