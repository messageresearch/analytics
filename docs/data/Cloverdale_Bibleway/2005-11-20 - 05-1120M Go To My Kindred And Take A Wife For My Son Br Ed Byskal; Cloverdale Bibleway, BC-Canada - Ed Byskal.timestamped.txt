[12:40] brother Tony, if you'd come and open the
[12:41] service in a word of prayer. There's a
[12:42] testimony from our sister Debbie Gier.
[12:45] Friday before camp, she was experiencing
[12:46] some chest pain. And uh following Sunday
[12:51] in service, Brother Bisll said, "Brother
[12:52] Mike and Sister Debbie, it's not just a
[12:54] miracle in the mating. The miracle uh
[12:56] has already happened." I just tucked
[12:59] this into my heart. I couldn't help but
[13:01] believe that God was confirming to me
[13:02] that all was well. Over the next few
[13:04] months, I went through a series of
[13:06] tests, one of which indicated a possible
[13:09] blood flow restriction, and she got her
[13:11] tests on Thursday confirming no
[13:14] blockage. Amen. We're thankful for that.
[13:22] want to remember this morning in prayer
[13:23] uh brother Mike Hunt has uh been
[13:26] speaking to a man uh Bob Bodner Bonder

[13:58] from Chattam, Ontario's requested prayer
[14:01] for her daughter Julie who was in a car
[14:02] accident 4 months ago is paralyzed. All
[14:06] she can do is move her hand open and
[14:07] closed for yes or no. And uh I just want
[14:11] to remember her and pray that God would
[14:14] just touch her and heal her. Brother
[14:15] Chris is requesting prayer for Donna
[14:17] Smith who needs total deliverance from
[14:20] drugs and her addiction has separated

[14:45] Samuel Dales, Brother Luis Escaro down
[14:48] in Chile, Argentina, and our precious
[14:51] brother Murphy who'll be making his way
[14:53] home today.
[14:54] Heavenly Father, how wonderful it is to
[14:57] be able to come into your presence this
[14:59] morning to lift you up, to place you in
[15:03] the highest place, Lord, as king of our
[15:06] lives, as our King Theophony, as our
[15:09] great bridegroom. Lord, we come humbly
[15:12] to you as your bride and yet knowing the
[15:16] confidence of our position, Father. For
[15:18] Lord, we see ourselves as a queen. We
[15:21] see ourselves as Mrs. Jesus Christ. This
[15:24] morning we see ourselves as Esther as
[15:26] she went and made her presence and her
[15:29] entrance into your great presence, the
[15:31] King of Kings and Lord of Lords. And
[15:33] Lord, we know that there was a scepter
[15:35] that was stretched forth to Esther,
[15:37] Lord, to ask and give her the the
[15:39] permission to ask all that was in her
[15:41] heart to do. And here we are as your
[15:43] bride this morning. Lord, we love you.
[15:46] We want you to be pleased with our
[15:48] lives, with our worship, Lord, with the
[15:50] testimony of our lips. We give you
[15:52] honor. We we give you a praise offering
[15:55] of thanksgiving this morning for the
[15:56] great and mighty things that you have
[15:58] done. How we rejoice with our sister
[16:00] Debbie, Lord, delivered, Father. Oh God,
[16:03] what doctors might have said was a
[16:05] problem. You, the divine physician,
[16:07] moved on the scene and delivered our
[16:09] sister. How we thank you for that, Lord.
[16:11] And we know there's many other
[16:12] testimonies here. How that you've been
[16:14] moving and stirring in hearts, Lord. Oh,
[16:17] we have such great confidence when we
[16:19] hear these reports to know that as we
[16:22] bring these petitions before you that
[16:24] Lord Jesus, if we ask it and if we claim
[16:27] it in that name that is above every
[16:30] other name that it shall be done.
[16:32] Hallelujah. That's our promise. We have
[16:35] expectation. We don't doubt as we ask
[16:38] now Lord as we bring these requests
[16:40] humbly before you Lord Jesus a mother
[16:45] Father oh God brother Gary St. John, if
[16:48] it was our mother that was in need of a
[16:50] healing, Lord, how we could enter into
[16:52] our brother's burden and certainly as a
[16:54] member of the body of Christ, Lord, we
[16:56] hold up our dear brother's mother,
[16:58] Sister Linda, in prayer this morning
[17:00] that you would move on her ha behalf,
[17:03] Father, and grant her the healing that
[17:05] she needs, Lord. Father, for these other
[17:08] requests as well, Lord, for this one
[17:10] that Sister Iris wrote in of this of
[17:12] this child, Lord, that's suffering with
[17:14] seizures. Lord Jesus, even though the
[17:17] parents may not be walking in the
[17:19] fullness of your word, Lord Jesus,
[17:21] that's irre doesn't matter, Lord, but
[17:24] Lord, we are praying and we're asking
[17:26] because our sister Iris has had a
[17:28] contact with this family. May you prove
[17:30] yourself the same yesterday, today, and
[17:32] forever to this once, Lord. And father,
[17:35] for another need, our dear sister,
[17:39] Lord Jesus, prayer for her daughter who
[17:41] was who was seriously injured in a car
[17:44] accident. Oh God, of such a young child,
[17:48] Lord, paralyze, oh father, if it was our
[17:52] young child, oh God, how we would want
[17:54] you to move on the scene. How we would
[17:56] want you to restore cells and bones and
[17:59] nerve endings, Lord. Oh Lord Jesus, we
[18:02] enter into our sister's burden. Lord,
[18:05] may your presence envelop that innocent
[18:07] child, Lord. May you just sweep over
[18:10] her, oh God. We've seen necks that were
[18:12] broken, healed. Hallelujah. We've seen
[18:14] children with seizures healed before,
[18:16] Lord Jesus. Oh God, one more time, we we
[18:20] hold up this child before you, Lord, of
[18:22] your glory, Lord, may be shown in this
[18:25] situation, and we pray that you would
[18:27] just move on the scene, Lord, and
[18:29] straighten out the bones in this child's
[18:31] body, Father. Oh Lord God, we're here to
[18:35] be witnesses. We're not just merely the
[18:38] bride of Christ, but we're we're Jesus
[18:40] Christ on display.
[18:43] Lord, we may be the only representation
[18:44] of your word that some will ever see.
[18:47] And how our brother Chris has been going
[18:49] out with others and testifying of your
[18:51] of your power, Lord, meeting these ones
[18:54] and speaking your word, a word of life.
[18:56] And there's a a woman, Lord, that's in
[18:59] that's in prison, in bondage to drugs
[19:02] and demon spirits. Father, oh Lord, we
[19:05] we project faith to this woman today,
[19:08] Lord, that this power of drug addiction,
[19:11] Lord, this demon that has possessed her
[19:13] mind and her body, that the power of God
[19:15] would break that demon spell.
[19:17] Hallelujah. Oh, we bind those devils
[19:20] that truth could and prevail in this
[19:23] situation and release our sister,
[19:25] Father. Release her by faith, Lord, as a
[19:27] sister in Christ that you have led our
[19:30] brothers to. And for our brother Mike,
[19:32] Lord, as he's been witnessing to a man
[19:34] that of the Jewish lineage, Lord,
[19:38] Father, maybe you'll open his eyes to
[19:39] see that the Messiah's already come.
[19:42] Maybe, Lord, he's one of those that must
[19:44] go back to Israel again to be able to
[19:46] see you as you reveal yourself to the
[19:48] children of Joseph, Lord. God, we pray
[19:51] for wisdom for brother Mike. That you
[19:52] would just bless him and open this man's
[19:55] eyes according to your perfect will. And
[19:57] Lord, for those that are out
[19:58] ministering, our brother Ernie, bless
[20:00] him, Father, anoint him in the service
[20:02] that he's in even now. Our brother Luis,
[20:05] Lord, as he's translating and providing
[20:07] the the messages and Lord, some of the
[20:10] ministry in Spanish down for brother
[20:12] Hugo in Chile and Argentina, bless him
[20:14] and Luis, Lord, bless brother Steven
[20:16] Kemper as he's down in Brazil. Father,
[20:18] oh Lord, make him a blessing to the
[20:20] saints there as well. And Father, for
[20:22] our precious brother Murphy, how we've
[20:24] missed him, Lord. Oh God, I know his
[20:27] family misses him too. And tomorrow
[20:29] he'll be coming home. And perhaps even
[20:31] now making preparation for his long
[20:33] journey. Be with him. Be with the
[20:36] believers that are in China, his family
[20:37] that have not yet fully received you.
[20:40] Anoint them with faith. We pray. And
[20:42] Lord, especially for our pastor, how we
[20:45] love the man of God. How we love your
[20:47] gift within him. How we've been so
[20:49] blessed, Lord. Oh, we just want to have
[20:53] Lord anticipation Lord. Oh God, help us
[20:56] to be on the edge of our seat, Lord. Let
[20:59] us not be tired. Let us not, Lord,
[21:01] weary. Let our thoughts be focused on
[21:04] what you have to say this morning, Lord.
[21:06] We need this refreshing. We need this
[21:08] anointing. And Lord, we want to pull on
[21:10] the gift this morning. Bless our dear
[21:12] pastor. Give him strength, Lord. Give
[21:14] Brother Ed an anointing that just Lord,
[21:16] he would be able to be free to say what
[21:18] you would have him to say. Lord, we
[21:20] don't look at the vessel. We look at God
[21:22] in the vessel. Hallelujah. And Lord, for
[21:24] everyone that's in the extended
[21:26] audience, those out on internet and
[21:28] telephone, part of the family of God,
[21:30] bless us all with your spirit and

[21:34] things in the name of Jesus Christ.

[26:42] [Music]
[26:45] just to sit
[26:47] one day at his side.
[26:52] When I get to that place,
[26:57] [Music]

[27:14] [Music]
[27:16] but he gave us something to stand.
[27:19] [Music]
[27:22] His word still keeps holding me
[27:27] while I'm living in this evil land.
[27:34] And though the whole world is crumbling
[27:38] around me,
[27:42] my eyes are fixed on the prize.
[27:48] Oh Lord, take me and completely
[27:52] fill me.
[27:55] Get me ready to take that flight.

[28:17] To the mark of the high calling
[28:23] in Christ Jesus will stand.
[28:30] The road is narrow,
[28:36] but I will still run for my prize
[28:43] just to sit. One day I decide
[28:50] when I get to that place.
[28:55] One day church. One day all our trials
[29:00] will be over.

[29:30] &gt;&gt; till I get to that place.
[29:33] &gt;&gt; Till I get to that place to the mark of
[29:38] the high holy
[29:42] in Christ Jesus.

[29:52] is narrow,
[29:56] but I'll still run for my
[30:04] justice.
[30:06] One day I decide
[30:10] when I get to that place. I'll keep on
[30:16] resting
[30:20] until I get to that place.
[30:23] &gt;&gt; Till I get to that place to the mark of
[30:28] the high calling
[30:32] in Christ Jesus. In Christ Jesus, we
[30:35] will stand.
[30:40] For the road is narrow,
[30:46] but I will still run for my prize.
[30:53] just to say
[30:55] one day I decide
[31:00] when I get to that place. The road is
[31:05] narrow.
[31:10] But I will still run for my pride.
[31:15] Just to sit. Just to sit.
[31:19] One day I decide.
[31:24] When I get to that place, I'll keep on
[31:29] pressing.
[31:33] Oh, I'll keep on pressing
[31:37] till I get to that place. I'll keep on
[31:42] pressing
[31:44] till I get to that place.

[35:21] &gt;&gt; Amen. God bless you. You may be seated.
[35:25] We're
[35:27] indeed happy to greet you all in the
[35:29] name of Jesus Christ.
[35:32] &gt;&gt; Wonderful to have the freedom and the
[35:33] liberty to be here gathered together.
[35:35] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[35:36] &gt;&gt; Amen. We also this evening we're having
[35:40] uh our brother Anatoli from Usbekiststan
[35:45] is going to come and speak this evening
[35:48] and our brother Peter
[35:51] uh is going to be in interpreting for
[35:53] him. Where's our brother
[35:56] uh Anatoli is where is he seated here?
[36:01] Uh let's welcome him brother Anatoli.
[36:11] Amen. I uh have only had a brief evening
[36:14] with our brother Anatoli. The last time
[36:16] I was not here when he was speaking and
[36:19] then he was in Tacoma so I went down to
[36:22] Tacoma and spent an evening with him. Uh
[36:25] and we had a real blessed time. uh he
[36:29] has a real fine church in that country
[36:32] of Usbekiststan
[36:34] and um I think the only church in the
[36:38] message there about 250 people I
[36:41] understand and most of those people all
[36:44] came in from hearing one tape just one
[36:48] tape false anointed ones at the end time
[36:52] that I mean that has special special
[36:54] depth for me because it was the on tape.
[36:58] Brother Brandham asked me if I heard.
[37:01] Of course, I couldn't have heard it
[37:02] because he hadn't spoke it yet, but
[37:04] there was a purpose in that also.
[37:07] Amen.
[37:09] &gt;&gt; This last Friday, we had a memorial
[37:12] service for our sister,
[37:16] Sister Marge Miller, and uh I think
[37:19] brother Glenn Grunard wanted to just
[37:21] make a comment uh on behalf of the
[37:24] family. Brother Glenn, would you please?
[37:28] And tonight, while Brother Glenn is
[37:30] coming, tonight we're having a baptismal
[37:32] service again.
[37:34] &gt;&gt; Uh, it looks like there's another three
[37:37] that are going to be baptized. That, you
[37:39] know what? That's going to be 50.
[37:42] &gt;&gt; Maybe that'll be Jubilee Night.
[37:45] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[37:48] Isn't that amazing? It's just wonderful.
[37:51] Come, Brother Glenn.
[37:53] God bless you.
[37:56] Put this up here.
[37:59] All right. God bless you, brother.
[38:02] I wanted to come up here personally. I
[38:05] didn't believe it was enough to just put
[38:07] a note in because of uh
[38:21] on behalf of all the family, we'd like
[38:22] to thank each and every one of you for
[38:26] being with us through this.
[38:29] um all the kind words, the prayers, the
[38:32] food,
[38:34] the babysitting for my children,
[38:37] having them over when we weren't able to
[38:38] be at home. Um
[38:41] and I know mom was very pleased also
[38:45] that so many people were here for us and
[38:47] for her.
[38:49] Um I'd like to uh thank brother Ed and
[38:53] Sister Ruth for being there.
[38:56] anytime we had a question, we needed to
[38:58] contact them, they were available 24
[39:00] hours a day for us and we're a blessed
[39:03] people
[39:07] &gt;&gt; and the rest of the ministry also I know
[39:09] we're there for mom. I thank you very
[39:11] much. I can't mention everybody
[39:14] basically have to mention everybody in
[39:16] this church for all the help they've
[39:18] been to us.
[39:20] I'd like to make one comment. Brother
[39:22] Joe at the service on Friday, Joe Wner
[39:26] came out to me and he said, you know,
[39:28] this doesn't even seem like a funeral
[39:29] service. He said, "This feels like a
[39:31] wedding." He said, "There's such joy and
[39:35] such peace." And I said, you know, it's
[39:36] a celebration of life, the life that my
[39:39] mom lived before everybody because it
[39:42] was the life of Jesus Christ.
[39:44] I thank you everyone. Hopefully we can
[39:47] return all the goodness you've bestowed
[39:50] upon us and basically uh on behalf of
[39:54] all the family uh grandchildren everyone
[39:57] we thank you very much for what you've
[39:59] done for us your goodness and your love
[40:00] and I know one person will never forget
[40:03] that and that's our Lord Jesus Christ
[40:05] you'll be blessed for it thank you very
[40:07] much
[40:13] brother Glenn and to the sisters I I
[40:16] know that they've already been thanked
[40:19] by the family, but um sisters of the
[40:22] congregation,
[40:24] I tell you, you I don't just say this to
[40:27] be flattering, but you're something
[40:29] else. I went into the
[40:33] uh into the fellowship room and saw four
[40:36] tables laden with uh food and
[40:40] refreshments and went into the kitchen
[40:42] and found as much in the kitchen as
[40:44] there was out in the fellowship room. I
[40:46] said, "Who are you planning to feed?"
[40:50] It was just an enormous amount. And I
[40:53] think they were able to send back with
[40:54] the families and that was nice. and and
[40:57] I thought they had enough probably to
[40:59] feed the entire young people's meeting
[41:00] that same night, Friday night. Well, the
[41:03] Lord is good, isn't he?
[41:05] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Tomorrow, Brother
[41:07] Murphy comes back from China, extended
[41:11] trip. And I can tell you that uh I know
[41:14] some little ones and a wife that's going
[41:16] to be very happy. Our sister Tracy and
[41:19] her parents, but especially Sister Tracy
[41:21] and the children. And God reward you for
[41:26] sacrificing the time with your husband
[41:29] for this I think two plus months isn't
[41:31] it brother Tony over two months and I
[41:34] can assure you one evening would not
[41:36] cover uh what has been happening in
[41:38] China it's just amazing absolutely
[41:42] amazing and uh soon as he gets back
[41:45] we'll be able to uh hear some of these
[41:48] things also been receiving some emails
[41:52] from Steven Keer in Brazil and uh he
[41:58] traveled to uh into the uh I would say
[42:02] interior
[42:03] uh into the village country he said
[42:06] where they were so very very poor
[42:08] materially
[42:10] but rich in faith
[42:12] &gt;&gt; rich in the word and that's lovely amen
[42:17] and even though we are here and you sit
[42:20] in nice seats and I hope it's
[42:22] comfortable for you and that you can
[42:24] hear the service and worship and all the
[42:26] rest of it, but you can still be rich in
[42:28] faith.
[42:29] &gt;&gt; Don't let these material things affect
[42:31] you in any way. It just happens to be
[42:33] our environment. But God never did say
[42:35] that if we got in this state in the end
[42:38] time, they're going to be he said, "Will
[42:40] he will the son of man find faith the
[42:42] faith on the earth?" because there's not
[42:44] going to be much of it and there isn't
[42:46] much of it but there is some
[42:48] &gt;&gt; and not only that it's an increased it's
[42:51] an increased portion because it's a
[42:53] bride portion.
[42:54] &gt;&gt; Amen. I believe that with all my heart
[42:57] and so we want to be remembering brother
[42:59] Murphy as he travels back and brother
[43:01] Steven while he's still away and I'm
[43:03] sure that they uh brother Roger and
[43:07] sister Gail are anxious to see have
[43:09] their son come back as well. But um it's
[43:12] amazing this email, you know, uh it just
[43:15] happens in seconds. I never was a very
[43:18] good letter writer, but when I can get
[43:20] it in just a few moments and I look at
[43:22] it and I say, you know what, I can
[43:25] actually have that answer back in a few
[43:27] moments, I'm I'm very tempted then and I
[43:29] try to get it right back. And uh I
[43:32] received one from South Africa uh
[43:36] yesterday and or day before and just
[43:38] sent a little answer back and he said I
[43:40] thought it was going to be days before I
[43:42] would hear from you. But I was so glad I
[43:44] answered it because it was just it was
[43:46] needed right at that time and and we
[43:49] just uh we have a long-standing
[43:51] friendship. So it's just really
[43:52] wonderful. I'm going to have you stand
[43:54] if you will with me and uh we're going
[43:58] to go to the word. Uh you can turn to
[44:02] Genesis the 24th chapter
[44:05] and we'll read some verses there.
[44:09] Before we read,
[44:12] let's speak to the author.
[44:16] Amen. We can turn the pages as you are
[44:18] with the human strength, but I can tell
[44:20] you as the prophet said, it takes
[44:23] something else and someone else.
[44:26] &gt;&gt; Amen. to open what's in these pages.
[44:30] &gt;&gt; May God help me, help us this morning.
[44:34] Our dear father God eternal in the
[44:37] heavens,
[44:38] you are the one that has uh been the
[44:41] author of this book.
[44:43] &gt;&gt; And Lord Jesus, you are the one that
[44:46] sent. You said, "I Jesus have sent mine
[44:48] angel." Yes.
[44:50] &gt;&gt; Oh God, I pray that today, this morning,
[44:53] that you'll send, Father, a special
[44:56] portion upon this waiting audience, upon
[45:01] those that are have joined with us and
[45:04] are connected hearttoheart,
[45:07] attribute to attribute, wherever they
[45:09] may be in the in the world today. Those
[45:12] here, Lord, in the fellowship room or in
[45:14] the nursery or whatever part of this
[45:16] building they're in. But we're waiting
[45:19] on you, Lord. Here in the sanctuary,
[45:21] we're waiting on you. I'm standing
[45:23] behind this pulpit and I'm waiting on
[45:26] you, oh God. And as your messenger said,
[45:28] we can do nothing, nothing, nothing, but
[45:32] you can do all things.
[45:34] &gt;&gt; And we believe in you today, Lord. Come
[45:37] in your power. Come in your grace and
[45:40] mercy and longsuffering. I pray, Father,
[45:42] that you will bless us today with just a
[45:45] special presence. We're looking to you,
[45:48] Lord. Our hearts are open. We realize we
[45:52] can do nothing within ourselves,
[45:54] Lord, but we're here to hear from you.
[45:58] Bless all, I pray. They stand at the
[46:00] post of duties in Jesus Christ's name.
[46:03] Anoint us now. Anoint me, Lord, I pray
[46:07] for your glory. Amen.
[46:11] I want to read from Genesis 24
[46:15] and we'll start at verse 4
[46:19] down to verse 7.
[46:22] But thou shalt go unto my country and to
[46:25] my kindred and take a wife unto my son
[46:29] Isaac.
[46:32] And the servant said unto him,
[46:34] Pre-adventure, the woman will not be
[46:37] willing to follow me unto this land,
[46:40] must thy needs bring thy son again unto
[46:44] the land from whence thou camest? And
[46:47] Abraham said unto him, Beware
[46:50] thou that thou bring not my son thither
[46:55] again.
[46:56] the Lord God of heaven, which took me
[46:59] from my father's house, and from the
[47:01] land of my kindred, and which spake unto
[47:04] me, and that swear unto me, saying, Unto
[47:08] the seed, unto thy seed will I give this
[47:11] land,
[47:12] he shall send his angel before thee, and
[47:15] thou shalt take a wife unto my son from
[47:18] then. Look at verse 27, please.
[47:24] And now Eleazar the servant is speaking.
[47:29] And he said, "Blessed be the Lord God of
[47:32] my master Abraham,
[47:35] who hath not left destitute my master of
[47:39] his mercy and his truth. I being in the
[47:43] way, the Lord led me to the house of my
[47:48] master's brethren."
[47:50] &gt;&gt; Amen. May God bless his word to our
[47:53] heart. You may want to keep your Bibles
[47:55] handy and open as you have your seats.
[48:02] I I want to take this text and that text
[48:04] largely is the theme of
[48:08] what I have on my heart to say to you.
[48:11] Go to my kindred
[48:15] and take a wife unto my son.
[48:20] Go to my kindred and take a wife unto my
[48:25] son.
[48:27] In the message, hear ye him.
[48:32] Brother Brham makes this comment. Well,
[48:36] what have we done? Speaking in Spokane,
[48:39] Washington,
[48:40] we've added members.
[48:43] We've got better churches, bigger
[48:44] membership.
[48:47] What we need is quality, not quantity.
[48:51] &gt;&gt; That's the trouble.
[48:53] That's the hunting of the bride today.
[48:57] That's the hunting of the bride today. I
[49:01] know something about hunting, been
[49:03] raised on it, and I can tell you that I
[49:06] have uh learned a few things. And you
[49:10] have to be
[49:12] sometimes subtle,
[49:15] sometimes very fast,
[49:18] sometimes
[49:20] very slow,
[49:23] very patient. And that's where most
[49:25] people stumble as a hunter. They're not
[49:29] patient. They just can't wait. They've
[49:32] got to move. They've got to do
[49:34] something.
[49:36] But that is something about hunting. Now
[49:39] the prophet is saying that's the hunting
[49:42] of the bride today. Eleazar
[49:46] had an awful time finding quality
[49:51] and then to get her ready to go was the
[49:55] next thing. So number one had an awful
[49:58] time finding quality. That was number
[50:01] one. After he found quality then to get
[50:04] her ready to go was the second thing.
[50:07] after he found it. So that's the next
[50:10] thing to do. He says, "Ah, we're hunting
[50:14] for that." Now,
[50:18] the Holy Spirit, God's servant was
[50:20] Eleazar, is hunting for that quality,
[50:24] that genuiness, that something that
[50:27] won't take back on God's word. Something
[50:29] that won't take back on God's word,
[50:32] won't fall back on God's word.
[50:36] It'll stand there, live or die, and say
[50:39] it's the truth. God said so, and that
[50:42] settles it.
[50:44] &gt;&gt; Amen. You know, even in our weak times
[50:47] or when we don't feel like uh giving
[50:50] some uh loud acclamation,
[50:54] confirmation of our faith in God. We all
[50:56] run into those times. But even in those
[50:59] moments, it's important that we make our
[51:01] declaration. It is the word of God is
[51:04] the truth. The message has declared it.
[51:08] God has confirmed it and I believe it
[51:11] and I disregard what whatever I'm going
[51:13] through right now has nothing to do with
[51:15] it.
[51:16] &gt;&gt; We'll all encounter
[51:18] uh our our difficult times. We'll all
[51:20] encounter times we don't have great
[51:22] feelings and we don't have great
[51:24] exuberance and we'll all encounter times
[51:26] when things are difficult in the world
[51:28] and reversals are happening and this
[51:31] isn't the way I planned it. We'll all
[51:33] have those times. We all do have those
[51:35] times. But it's what comes out of our
[51:37] mouth by the confession of our mouth.
[51:40] This word is the truth of God. He has
[51:42] declared it. He has confirmed it. He has
[51:44] vindicated it. And I believe it.
[51:47] &gt;&gt; And devil, you can just take that.
[51:51] &gt;&gt; It's important that we do that.
[51:53] &gt;&gt; Not doesn't just bolster ourselves up.
[51:55] It is declaring what is true.
[51:59] I would like if we could this morning
[52:03] to look at the big picture and I hope
[52:05] it's not too big. We'd like to see I
[52:09] would like if we could see
[52:11] all that God has done. If we could view
[52:14] things from this perspective, if we
[52:17] could see all that God has done, all
[52:20] that is recorded in the word of God.
[52:24] all that is happening
[52:27] presently, anything that has taken place
[52:30] in our lives
[52:32] and all that God might do in our in the
[52:36] future. If we could just look at the
[52:38] whole picture and funnel it down and say
[52:42] it was for one purpose,
[52:44] it was that God would send out his Holy
[52:48] Spirit and draw
[52:51] a bride, a wife for his son Jesus
[52:55] Christ. That is the purpose. This is, as
[53:00] many have said, the greatest love story.
[53:04] And it begins with the first Adam and
[53:07] his wife in Eden right in the opening
[53:11] chapters and concludes with the second
[53:14] Adam and his wife in the closing
[53:17] chapters. Come, I will show you the
[53:20] lamb's wife. That is what the whole
[53:22] whole story is about. And if we could
[53:25] just have an overview
[53:27] and somewhere between this in Genesis
[53:31] and this in Revelation, somewhere
[53:34] between that, here we're sitting
[53:35] tonight, this morning,
[53:37] &gt;&gt; here we are, and we're either part of
[53:40] that or we're not. And if we declare I
[53:45] am part of that then everything that God
[53:50] has done that he has planned that he's
[53:52] ordained redemption and salvation and
[53:55] the sacrifice and the sending of the
[53:58] Holy Spirit and the birth of the early
[54:00] church and all that ever happened has
[54:02] happened. It all has happened for that
[54:05] purpose that that this Bible can have a
[54:09] consummation that there can be a time.
[54:12] We call it the end, but it's not really
[54:14] the end. It's the beginning.
[54:16] &gt;&gt; It's just going to unfold into greater
[54:19] things, greater realities.
[54:22] &gt;&gt; In the millennium, the prophet said, he
[54:24] talked about all the scientific
[54:26] achievement and how that television has
[54:29] sounds going through the room and we
[54:31] just don't have the device right here.
[54:33] We could pick it up a radio and do the
[54:34] dial and you could hear all kinds of
[54:36] voices. Where are they coming from? They
[54:38] may be coming from uh uh the Europe or
[54:42] South America or or somewhere else, but
[54:44] but they're going through here right
[54:46] now. We're not set up to catch that
[54:48] sound.
[54:49] &gt;&gt; And there's he said there's colors going
[54:51] through the room and there's voices
[54:53] going through the room. There's bodies.
[54:55] He said bodies going through the room.
[54:57] There's images going through the room
[54:58] right now. You don't have the device to
[55:00] catch it.
[55:02] &gt;&gt; But that's the time that we're living
[55:03] in. And he said television was here when
[55:06] Elijah was here. Television was here
[55:09] when Jesus was here. Television was here
[55:11] when Moses was here. But they didn't
[55:13] have they didn't have the the technology
[55:17] to catch it. But it was here. God had
[55:19] set all of that in motion from the very
[55:22] beginning. And he said and and he said,
[55:24] "And and likewise are the angels here.
[55:28] And likewise is Jesus Christ here. This
[55:31] body is not set up to feel him or these
[55:34] eyes are not set up to t to see him. So
[55:38] we can't touch him. We can't see him.
[55:40] And these ears are not made to hear him.
[55:43] But we have been given by God. We've
[55:46] been given every son and daughter of God
[55:48] has been given a device that can hear
[55:50] him, that can sense him, that can see
[55:53] him. And it is much clearer vision than
[55:56] these eyes. We're not talking about 2020
[55:59] now. We're talking about something
[56:00] that's divinely given of God. And and
[56:03] for those people, for those that hear
[56:06] him, see him, know him, for those
[56:08] people,
[56:10] this entire story, everything that's
[56:12] happened has happened for one purpose,
[56:15] and that is go get my son,
[56:19] &gt;&gt; a wife. Amen.
[56:23] Shall I if she won't come, shall I bring
[56:27] your son back again? That would have
[56:30] broken the type because Jesus Christ is
[56:33] not coming back into this element.
[56:35] &gt;&gt; It's going to be a changed world. When
[56:38] he come, when he arrives, what he's what
[56:41] he's doing now is sending his messenger,
[56:44] sent his servant to take us to him
[56:47] &gt;&gt; where he is. Hallelujah. beyond this
[56:51] veil and this corruption that is here,
[56:54] this sin, this degradation. We're going
[56:57] He came and he suffered that once and he
[57:00] suffered once and shed his blood once
[57:04] and carried it into the Holy of Holies
[57:06] once. Hallelujah. He doesn't have to do
[57:08] it again. And then he's getting his
[57:11] redeemed and taking them to him.
[57:14] &gt;&gt; Amen. everything that's been done and
[57:17] everything that is happening.
[57:20] I want to focus on on that.
[57:24] Some of you have your families here.
[57:28] Some of you young people have your
[57:31] parents here
[57:36] and you have some natural human ties.
[57:41] But I would like to suggest to you that
[57:43] all of that
[57:45] is only secondary,
[57:48] very much secondary. We feel close to
[57:51] them. I feel very close to my family.
[57:55] But I have to confess and keep in mind
[57:57] that's very secondary to the family that
[58:00] God determined he would institute.
[58:04] And one that you may not feel closely to
[58:07] emotionally. There be no emotional tie
[58:10] in God's mind or much closer to you than
[58:14] even family
[58:16] because it's his family.
[58:19] He said, "Where's the house that you
[58:21] build me? Where's my household? Where's
[58:23] my sons? Where's my daughters? Where are
[58:26] they?" That's the family that God is
[58:30] real, real concerned with.
[58:33] I'll say all those that God used down
[58:36] through the ages
[58:38] have a dual purpose. If we were to look
[58:40] in the Old Testament, all those that God
[58:43] used, all down through the ages have a
[58:46] dual two-fold purpose. One was they had
[58:50] to live out that part that was allotted
[58:53] to them for that season that they lived.
[58:57] but God working through them, God
[59:00] speaking through them, God laying out
[59:04] the word and using all of the various
[59:07] vessels
[59:09] uh and uh those that he chose all down
[59:12] through the ages had an extended purpose
[59:15] and that purpose was through them
[59:18] ultimately because the whole focus here
[59:21] is go get my son a wife. Yes.
[59:24] &gt;&gt; Go and get my son alive.
[59:28] &gt;&gt; And everything that they lived was all
[59:30] part of that. God was uh God was just
[59:34] extending through them because their
[59:36] lives first were lived out to live a uh
[59:41] an an example. They have their own life
[59:43] to live and their own uh commission.
[59:47] They had to uh fulfill what God had
[59:50] ordained for them while they lived in
[59:53] their lifetime. Be it Abraham, be it
[59:55] Joseph, be it Samuel, whoever it was, be
[59:57] it David, they had to live that life
[1:00:00] that God had ordained for them. But
[1:00:02] secondly, their lives were a type and a
[1:00:06] shadow of things which were to come.
[1:00:09] Rebecca, her type still lives now this
[1:00:12] morning. She had her life to live. She
[1:00:15] had to get on her camel. You have to get
[1:00:17] on yours.
[1:00:20] &gt;&gt; She had to say, "I will go." You have to
[1:00:22] say, "I will go."
[1:00:25] &gt;&gt; As I'm going to a land and to a man I've
[1:00:27] never seen, but I I have confidence in
[1:00:29] this messenger. You have to have the
[1:00:31] same.
[1:00:33] &gt;&gt; If you don't have the same, you're not
[1:00:34] going to get there.
[1:00:36] &gt;&gt; You've got to have that same quality,
[1:00:39] &gt;&gt; that same uh faith.
[1:00:43] &gt;&gt; You see, it all it all had a purpose. It
[1:00:46] all had an extended purpose. God
[1:00:50] through her was really saying and God
[1:00:55] through Eleazar saying
[1:00:59] he said the Lord in his prayer the Lord
[1:01:02] has led me
[1:01:05] to the house of my master's brethren.
[1:01:09] Now, one person in this generation who
[1:01:13] could really make that a declaration,
[1:01:15] and perhaps he did, would be brother
[1:01:18] Brandham himself. He could say, "The
[1:01:21] Lord has led me. I've journeyied a long
[1:01:24] ways. I've traveled around the world,
[1:01:27] seven times around the earth. I've been
[1:01:29] in the many nations and been in dark
[1:01:32] places and been in great auditoriums,
[1:01:36] been in these various countries. But the
[1:01:38] Lord has led me to my master's house.
[1:01:42] &gt;&gt; The Lord has led me to my master's
[1:01:45] kindred.
[1:01:47] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:01:49] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Oh, my friends today to be
[1:01:52] able to sit here and say, "God led him
[1:01:55] to his master's kindred."
[1:01:59] &gt;&gt; To his master's children,
[1:02:02] &gt;&gt; I was connected to the master before the
[1:02:04] messenger came.
[1:02:06] [Applause]
[1:02:08] Can you believe that?
[1:02:10] &gt;&gt; You were connected. You were kindred.
[1:02:13] &gt;&gt; Before the master came,
[1:02:15] &gt;&gt; before the messenger came,
[1:02:19] Rebecca was already a kindred. She was
[1:02:22] already part of the family, it was only
[1:02:25] Eleer telling her that she had another
[1:02:27] role to fulfill.
[1:02:30] &gt;&gt; A role that she didn't realize, didn't
[1:02:32] dream she would ever fulfill that role.
[1:02:36] We've been called to a place.
[1:02:39] And so they lived out their part of
[1:02:42] God's plan in the age that they were
[1:02:46] called to live in. And they lived a
[1:02:50] testimony for future generations.
[1:02:53] God working through them as messengers.
[1:02:56] Messengers sent.
[1:02:59] In one way, Rebecca, and I'm just using
[1:03:01] that as an example because that's the
[1:03:03] scripture we're at, Rebecca. In one way,
[1:03:06] she could say,
[1:03:09] "I've been called.
[1:03:12] I've been called by this man. I've been
[1:03:16] called." And he was he's been sent. And
[1:03:19] I've been called through him to go to a
[1:03:22] man uh the son of a great man. and I'm
[1:03:27] to go to this son and I'm to be his
[1:03:30] wife. This is incredible. This is a this
[1:03:33] is amazing. But that's what I've been
[1:03:35] called for. But and that is her lot
[1:03:39] during her lifetime. But in her future
[1:03:43] testimony, in the future extension of
[1:03:47] God through her record, she also was one
[1:03:51] sent
[1:03:53] for you.
[1:03:55] &gt;&gt; Because we may have you uh those that
[1:03:59] read the scriptures, you read the Bible
[1:04:02] and you might be reading about Moses.
[1:04:05] You might be reading about some other
[1:04:06] servant of God and you read through the
[1:04:09] scriptures. So you could be you could be
[1:04:11] reading concerning the the New Testament
[1:04:13] of the disciples and what Peter did or
[1:04:16] Paul did and the life they lived and
[1:04:19] somehow on the one hand they had been
[1:04:23] called to live out the life and do the
[1:04:27] things that they were called to do. That
[1:04:29] was that was part one. Part two was they
[1:04:32] were sent and their record was written
[1:04:36] out and you perhaps read it and while
[1:04:39] you were reading it, the Holy Spirit who
[1:04:42] gave authorship to the book, to this
[1:04:44] book, the word of God, that Holy Spirit
[1:04:48] comes to you and speaks to you and grips
[1:04:52] you m moves you because of their record,
[1:04:56] because of their testimony. In that
[1:04:58] respect, they were sent to you because
[1:05:01] through their testimony, through their
[1:05:04] life, through their example, you were
[1:05:06] drawn
[1:05:08] &gt;&gt; Godward.
[1:05:09] &gt;&gt; And that's the purpose. That's the
[1:05:11] second part of the purpose. The one was
[1:05:13] they had their life to live. And the
[1:05:15] second part was they were also sent to
[1:05:19] find that bride.
[1:05:20] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[1:05:22] &gt;&gt; If you cannot understand my my concept
[1:05:26] &gt;&gt; and I'd like to just take a quantum leap
[1:05:28] just for a moment so I can get you your
[1:05:30] mind in the same channel that that my
[1:05:33] whole heart and burden for the word is
[1:05:35] this morning. You have been called
[1:05:39] &gt;&gt; and that you know
[1:05:41] &gt;&gt; I've been called. You've been called.
[1:05:43] You sat in the meeting. You felt the
[1:05:44] call. I heard the call.
[1:05:47] &gt;&gt; I felt the pull. But I'm here today to
[1:05:50] say, have you heard that you've been
[1:05:51] sent?
[1:05:53] &gt;&gt; As the father has sent me, so send I you
[1:05:58] &gt;&gt; for what purpose?
[1:06:01] Get my bride.
[1:06:03] &gt;&gt; You say, "Well, I thought that was a
[1:06:04] messenger's responsibility." It was
[1:06:07] indeed that was initially his
[1:06:09] responsibility. But you have received
[1:06:11] that. You've received the call. And
[1:06:14] after receiving the call, while you live
[1:06:16] out your part, God is extending himself
[1:06:19] by the Holy Spirit through you. And your
[1:06:22] life is influencing someone else,
[1:06:24] speaking to someone else. Maybe someone
[1:06:26] you'll never see or never know or shake
[1:06:28] their hand, but you're having an effect
[1:06:30] on them and drawing them God word. You
[1:06:33] were sent to that one.
[1:06:37] &gt;&gt; And herein
[1:06:39] is a natural life. your mothers and
[1:06:42] fathers that are here. You mothers and
[1:06:44] fathers that are have families,
[1:06:47] God has called you on one sense and
[1:06:51] you're living out your life as God gives
[1:06:54] you wisdom and direction, but beyond
[1:06:58] that, you have been sent
[1:07:01] first to your family. You've been sent
[1:07:04] to them. I'm getting way ahead of
[1:07:06] myself, but I thought and I was so
[1:07:09] affected by the prodal son, we call him
[1:07:12] the prodal son,
[1:07:14] and he took his portion of the
[1:07:17] inheritance, took it to a far country
[1:07:20] and wasted it with riotous living
[1:07:24] and with all kinds of uh who knows what
[1:07:29] kind of parties he was in there in his
[1:07:32] riotous living. And then when he came to
[1:07:35] nothing, his friends kind of vanished.
[1:07:38] But a citizen of that country. It's
[1:07:40] amazing how you get connected with the
[1:07:43] wrong people
[1:07:45] &gt;&gt; when you start wasting your substance,
[1:07:48] waste your strength, waste your youth.
[1:07:51] &gt;&gt; Whatever you do, young people, I tell
[1:07:53] you, the devil's a liar. And he can
[1:07:56] never be truthful. He tell you, "Oh,
[1:07:58] wait. Have some fun." Yeah, have some
[1:08:00] fun. All right. Your youth will be gone.
[1:08:03] Your strength will be gone. Your beauty
[1:08:05] will be gone. Years will be gone. You
[1:08:07] will have wasted them. Don't waste them.
[1:08:10] I say to you all that are here today,
[1:08:13] how time is so fleeting. And you'll soon
[1:08:16] find that the time of opportunity slips
[1:08:18] by. Don't let it slip by. Now is the
[1:08:22] day. If you're here without Christ, now
[1:08:25] is the day of salvation. Today is the
[1:08:27] day. Now is the moment. When should I
[1:08:30] surrender to Christ? 5 minutes ago.
[1:08:33] Hallelujah.
[1:08:35] Not at the end of the meeting. Surrender
[1:08:37] now.
[1:08:38] I surrender all. I give myself to you.
[1:08:41] What a privilege this is. There's a call
[1:08:44] that goes out. And the call the call
[1:08:47] goes out to call you in. But then by the
[1:08:50] same token, you're also sent.
[1:08:52] You're sent to someone sitting beside
[1:08:54] you. You're sent to be an influence.
[1:08:57] You're sent to have an effect. You're
[1:08:59] sent to say the right thing.
[1:09:02] &gt;&gt; You're sent by God
[1:09:04] &gt;&gt; for his one purpose.
[1:09:06] &gt;&gt; My wife,
[1:09:07] &gt;&gt; my bride,
[1:09:09] &gt;&gt; this is what the story is all about.
[1:09:12] That's how the book ends.
[1:09:14] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:09:16] &gt;&gt; The lamb and his wife.
[1:09:20] &gt;&gt; That's what this whole thing is about.
[1:09:23] &gt;&gt; And the prodical son got connected with
[1:09:25] the wrong people. He got connected by
[1:09:28] the that's the only people he get
[1:09:29] connected with with the direction he
[1:09:31] went.
[1:09:33] &gt;&gt; But while he was feeding the hogs and
[1:09:37] living off of their food and that's all
[1:09:41] that's out there.
[1:09:45] &gt;&gt; We had prayer this morning cuz I got a
[1:09:47] call this morning. a man from a
[1:09:51] incredibly wealthy family in Canada, one
[1:09:56] of Canada's wealthier families.
[1:09:59] And the man was born a privileged child,
[1:10:03] born in wealth and and opulence,
[1:10:08] could have had anything and probably
[1:10:10] did, but he wasted the substance somehow
[1:10:14] and became addicted to cocaine. And
[1:10:17] today he's 58 years old. Today while I
[1:10:20] got the call, he's reading the message
[1:10:22] leadership. Oh, I thought what a what a
[1:10:26] message for him. How he needed that
[1:10:28] leadership in his life.
[1:10:32] And today he's reading it. Perhaps while
[1:10:34] we're still here in church, he's reading
[1:10:36] that leadership, but he wasted his
[1:10:39] substance and his life is gone. And I
[1:10:42] can tell you, the same devil that talks
[1:10:44] to you talks to him. The same devil that
[1:10:46] talked to him talks to you and I. Talks
[1:10:48] to you young people. Oh, wait. Oh, and
[1:10:52] just have your time. Don't listen to
[1:10:54] him. He's a liar. And when you get my
[1:10:57] age, you'll be so thankful. Well, I'm
[1:10:59] thankful for the biscll you told me.
[1:11:01] Nailed it down. I don't want to give him
[1:11:04] a moment of my life. One minute is one
[1:11:07] minute too long.
[1:11:09] Don't give him a moment of your life.
[1:11:12] And you'll get connected to the wrong
[1:11:13] people. You'll have the wrong boyfriend.
[1:11:15] You'll have the wrong girlfriend. You'll
[1:11:18] have the wrong wife,
[1:11:19] &gt;&gt; the wrong husband. You'll have trouble.
[1:11:23] And the devil be laughing at your
[1:11:24] foolishness. Said you listen to that
[1:11:26] kind of preaching and then went out like
[1:11:28] this, went away.
[1:11:31] &gt;&gt; God have mercy.
[1:11:33] &gt;&gt; And while he was there eating the husks
[1:11:35] of the hogs,
[1:11:37] &gt;&gt; feeding on the pig's food,
[1:11:40] &gt;&gt; he awakened.
[1:11:42] Amen.
[1:11:43] &gt;&gt; He came to himself
[1:11:46] &gt;&gt; and this was his great revelation.
[1:11:50] &gt;&gt; My father,
[1:11:52] &gt;&gt; he treats his servants better
[1:11:57] &gt;&gt; than I'm being treated.
[1:12:00] He remembered how his daddy treated his
[1:12:03] employees.
[1:12:08] &gt;&gt; He didn't have some great revelation of
[1:12:10] the creator and heavens and earth and
[1:12:13] some massive thing when his daddy
[1:12:17] back when he was a boy.
[1:12:19] when his daddy was treating his servants
[1:12:23] and his workers and giving them
[1:12:25] sufficient bread and treating his
[1:12:27] employees correctly according to the law
[1:12:32] that stuck in his heart.
[1:12:35] &gt;&gt; How my father treats his employees
[1:12:40] &gt;&gt; and the father perhaps not realizing
[1:12:42] that actually that act in that act he
[1:12:46] was sending for his son.
[1:12:52] [Applause]
[1:12:55] You mothers and fathers,
[1:12:57] &gt;&gt; you may not realize it, but while you
[1:13:01] live your life, you're being observed
[1:13:05] by your own and by others around you.
[1:13:09] But your old family, children are
[1:13:12] watching you. They're observing you. And
[1:13:15] you may not realize it. They may go
[1:13:17] astray, but one day they wake up.
[1:13:20] &gt;&gt; One day the Holy Spirit will bring them
[1:13:23] to their senses.
[1:13:25] &gt;&gt; Say, "I remember
[1:13:27] &gt;&gt; what my father said, what my mother
[1:13:29] said, how they lived, and the integrity
[1:13:32] that they had."
[1:13:35] &gt;&gt; And that's all he thought of.
[1:13:37] &gt;&gt; How my father treated his employees, his
[1:13:40] servants.
[1:13:42] He said, "That's better than I'm at
[1:13:46] &gt;&gt; and I'll just go back and be one of his
[1:13:47] servants."
[1:13:51] &gt;&gt; This came to my mind and I'm going to do
[1:13:53] it anyway.
[1:13:57] Our brother Jim Douly is here
[1:14:00] and very often he's away
[1:14:04] but at his there was a children the
[1:14:07] family put on a little birthday for him
[1:14:10] some years ago.
[1:14:13] I won't say how many. I don't know
[1:14:15] exactly
[1:14:16] but I believe it was your 50th birthday,
[1:14:18] brother Jim.
[1:14:23] And I don't believe Brother Jim will
[1:14:25] mind if I say this,
[1:14:28] but he has an eldest son.
[1:14:30] And this eldest son
[1:14:33] is much like the younger son
[1:14:37] today. He's not
[1:14:39] here in fellowship.
[1:14:42] He's up in the Yukon.
[1:14:44] And I think mother and dad are sitting
[1:14:46] here.
[1:14:48] And I get very personal at times and
[1:14:50] perhaps go out on a branch, out on a
[1:14:52] limb, but I believe I could speak on
[1:14:54] behalf of Brother Jim and Sister Lynn.
[1:14:56] They wish that he was where they are
[1:14:59] spiritually.
[1:15:04] But that son, his name is also James,
[1:15:08] and he got up and spoke on behalf of his
[1:15:10] dad.
[1:15:12] It's the only time I've experienced in
[1:15:14] my life, brother Jim, Sister Len,
[1:15:18] where something fit the scripture so
[1:15:20] perfectly.
[1:15:23] And I know he does not walk in the light
[1:15:25] of the word
[1:15:27] as you desire he would, but he got up to
[1:15:31] speak about his father.
[1:15:35] And I can see he was moved. He was
[1:15:38] exercised somewhat.
[1:15:41] And he wasn't just saying nice things,
[1:15:43] but he referred to one thing specific.
[1:15:47] He said, "The way my father treats
[1:15:52] his employees."
[1:15:54] &gt;&gt; Said, "I hope I can do that
[1:15:57] &gt;&gt; when I'm his age."
[1:16:01] &gt;&gt; I hope I can have that testimony.
[1:16:07] &gt;&gt; I hope I can have that testimony.
[1:16:10] Somehow I was touched and I never forgot
[1:16:14] that.
[1:16:15] I thought that was really special
[1:16:19] to have a son saying and that's what
[1:16:22] this boy was saying while he's in the
[1:16:25] pig pen
[1:16:27] &gt;&gt; saying my father my father treats his
[1:16:31] servants better than I'm being treated.
[1:16:36] I will return.
[1:16:38] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And
[1:16:39] &gt;&gt; brother Jim, may God based on your
[1:16:42] testimony
[1:16:43] grant you that on the basis of the word
[1:16:46] of God, I believe the Holy Spirit works
[1:16:50] on those things.
[1:16:52] &gt;&gt; So, not only are we called, but we're
[1:16:55] also sent. And I'm sure our brother Jim
[1:16:59] as well as perhaps the father recorded
[1:17:00] in the scripture and us that are here,
[1:17:04] we perhaps did something just as a
[1:17:06] matter of responsibility
[1:17:08] and didn't realize that that act was
[1:17:12] actually uh the the it was actually the
[1:17:15] arm of God reaching into the future that
[1:17:18] would be the very power that would call
[1:17:22] and you've been sent to that one to call
[1:17:24] them back
[1:17:26] &gt;&gt; to father's house.
[1:17:43] &gt;&gt; It's always been someone's been sent.
[1:17:49] John said, John the Baptist said, "I'm
[1:17:53] not the Christ,
[1:17:55] but I am sent
[1:17:57] before him. I'm sent for the purpose
[1:18:02] of getting a hold of some of you."
[1:18:05] That's why I've been sent. Had to
[1:18:06] realize that.
[1:18:08] And the scripture says, "God sent his
[1:18:11] only begotten son. Jesus Christ was
[1:18:13] sent."
[1:18:15] And when the word sent comes into the
[1:18:18] Hebrew, it has a a a definite purpose.
[1:18:22] I'm sent.
[1:18:25] And this this I want to nail down. I
[1:18:28] want to really draw you into this
[1:18:33] what I feel is for us this morning.
[1:18:39] We're not here just to be recipients.
[1:18:42] You're not here in church this morning
[1:18:44] just to be blessed and be recipients of
[1:18:46] God's blessing. But God would
[1:18:49] superimpose on your mind that you're not
[1:18:52] just a son and daughter of your father
[1:18:55] and mother. That is not it. God. If
[1:18:59] you're a called a child of Christ, if
[1:19:02] you're called as a son and daughter of
[1:19:04] God, then I am to announce to you today,
[1:19:06] and I've never spoken on this subject in
[1:19:08] my life, but I feel I'm ordained of God
[1:19:11] to announce to you today, you have been
[1:19:13] sent to this generation. You've been
[1:19:17] sent to some people that will make
[1:19:20] contact with you. You've been sent to
[1:19:22] more than you'll ever realize.
[1:19:25] and your words and your actions and your
[1:19:28] very character.
[1:19:31] &gt;&gt; Your manner, your demeanor, your
[1:19:33] conduct, all of these things
[1:19:37] are part of God's commission to us. You
[1:19:42] have been sent, go get my son,
[1:19:48] a bride.
[1:19:55] And when the fullness of time was come,
[1:19:58] God sent forth a son made of a woman
[1:20:01] made under the law.
[1:20:04] And then said Jesus,
[1:20:08] as my father hath sent me,
[1:20:11] so send I you.
[1:20:16] One that has sent, he is sent. He's one
[1:20:19] that is sent forth
[1:20:22] and he's sent with orders. Brother
[1:20:24] Brandham said, "If we work for someone,
[1:20:27] the first thing we need to do is find
[1:20:30] out what he wants us to do." Today, I'm
[1:20:33] here to say to this congregation and all
[1:20:36] who hear, we haven't been sent just to
[1:20:39] be called by the message. We haven't
[1:20:42] been We haven't been born, I should say,
[1:20:44] just to be called by the message, to be
[1:20:46] called by the messenger. But also we
[1:20:50] have been called that you might be
[1:20:52] commissioned and that you might make
[1:20:54] known be know what it is that God wants
[1:20:57] you to do and realize I've been sent.
[1:21:00] Tomorrow morning when you start your
[1:21:02] duties wherever you are realize you're
[1:21:04] sent.
[1:21:06] &gt;&gt; If mothers take their children to school
[1:21:08] I've been sent. Those that are teaching
[1:21:10] in the classes I've been sent. Wherever
[1:21:13] the men at the factory I've been sent of
[1:21:15] God. I've been sent to this place. I've
[1:21:18] been sent to have an effect in the
[1:21:19] world. I've been sent. I have a
[1:21:21] commission of almighty God. I am a scent
[1:21:25] one.
[1:21:27] &gt;&gt; Not just John the Baptist, not just
[1:21:29] Jesus, not just William Brandham, not
[1:21:30] just Paul.
[1:21:32] You
[1:21:35] &gt;&gt; that will change things.
[1:21:40] You may have some extreme difficulties
[1:21:42] tomorrow. Just remember, I've been sent
[1:21:45] to face this. Amen.
[1:21:47] &gt;&gt; I've been sent to experience this.
[1:21:49] &gt;&gt; I've been sent to have this ridicule.
[1:21:51] That's
[1:21:51] &gt;&gt; right.
[1:21:52] &gt;&gt; You kids in school, I've been sent
[1:21:54] &gt;&gt; I've been sent this person was sent to
[1:21:56] even tell me I'm I'm wacko or whatever.
[1:22:01] &gt;&gt; Or someone else will say, "What do you
[1:22:04] have?
[1:22:04] &gt;&gt; I've observed you. You've been sent to
[1:22:06] them.
[1:22:16] The Bible says that God sent his son.
[1:22:21] God sent his son.
[1:22:24] When did that begin? When did he send
[1:22:26] his son?
[1:22:28] When Mary conceived? No.
[1:22:31] When did he send his son?
[1:22:34] And I'm saying today, God sent you. When
[1:22:37] did he send you? When was it that he
[1:22:39] intended to send you? Well, he intended
[1:22:42] you to appear at this time. He intended
[1:22:45] you to hear and be called by the word
[1:22:47] that you've been called by. He intended
[1:22:50] that to happen. And he intended also
[1:22:52] that you would realize, I'm not just
[1:22:54] been called. I haven't just been uh one
[1:22:57] that's been brought in to receive
[1:22:58] wonderful things. I've also been one
[1:23:01] commissioned. I've also been one
[1:23:03] anointed. I've also have received the
[1:23:05] Holy Spirit. And I am a sent one.
[1:23:10] &gt;&gt; And the one I am sent to somewhere out
[1:23:12] in this crowd, somewhere out in this
[1:23:15] world that I mingle with, somewhere out
[1:23:17] there, I've been sent to someone. And
[1:23:19] they're going to read, they're going to
[1:23:20] see something. They're going to hear
[1:23:22] something. They're going to be
[1:23:23] influenced in a certain direction. And
[1:23:25] that is actually God from before the
[1:23:27] foundation of the world who saw I would
[1:23:29] come here at this time extending his arm
[1:23:31] through me and pulling this member of
[1:23:34] the bride of Jesus Christ. So I am set
[1:23:36] to them.
[1:23:38] &gt;&gt; Get him.
[1:23:40] &gt;&gt; Get her.
[1:23:46] &gt;&gt; So when did God send you?
[1:23:56] God sent for some
[1:23:59] amongst the Christian businessmen.
[1:24:06] In the message who is Jesus
[1:24:09] this was quite late message 1964
[1:24:14] but it tells brother Brennham tells
[1:24:18] about brother Deus Shakarian who is the
[1:24:21] president of the international
[1:24:24] Christian businessman Christian
[1:24:26] businessmen international
[1:24:28] and he says the international president
[1:24:31] brother Shakarian in
[1:24:33] I was made acquainted with him many
[1:24:35] years ago.
[1:24:37] I believe it was in the early 50s.
[1:24:43] I think about 51 because he said he was
[1:24:45] going to Africa right after that.
[1:24:48] And when he went to Africa, it was
[1:24:50] Sister Linda Maritz's father
[1:24:53] and just a a very small handful of
[1:24:56] people that met him and had him. And I I
[1:25:00] became aware of that when I first met
[1:25:02] brother Ratif.
[1:25:04] And so he's an eyewitness
[1:25:06] to having met him
[1:25:09] in uh in Africa. I believe the the
[1:25:11] second time that he was there. I don't
[1:25:13] believe it was the first time, but
[1:25:14] second time. I'm not too exactly sure on
[1:25:17] that. He said and
[1:25:21] uh he said many of you know about it.
[1:25:25] And brother Brandon begins to begins to
[1:25:27] relate. He says of the telegrams laying
[1:25:29] on my desk so high telegrams come here
[1:25:34] pray for this one pray for that one and
[1:25:36] he's sifting through these telegrams
[1:25:39] and he says and I found a woman named
[1:25:42] Shakarion
[1:25:44] dying with cancer now he's got a pile of
[1:25:47] telegrams come to my church come to our
[1:25:50] city the Christian or the businessmen or
[1:25:52] whatever more the ministerial
[1:25:55] association or whatever it was
[1:25:56] invitations
[1:25:57] hundreds if not thousands
[1:26:01] piles and he's sifting through them
[1:26:04] just going through these telegrams and
[1:26:06] he sees this name Shakarion
[1:26:10] he says and someone the Lord
[1:26:13] and somehow the Lord led me over
[1:26:19] and that's where I got acquainted with
[1:26:21] the Shakarans when she was healed
[1:26:25] and from That time God led me over.
[1:26:30] Now here is this
[1:26:33] messenger
[1:26:35] called of God.
[1:26:37] Go get my son, a bride,
[1:26:40] bringing a message to a world in the
[1:26:43] very early 50s. The second pull, the
[1:26:48] revealing of the secrets of the hearts
[1:26:50] maybe just beginning and uh and the
[1:26:53] message hasn't even opened up yet. and
[1:26:55] the opening of the seals and the
[1:26:56] serpent's seat and all of these things
[1:26:58] haven't even been spoken but already a
[1:27:01] doors opening and he sees this name
[1:27:03] amongst all of those and it's Shakarion
[1:27:07] and from seeing that name he said God
[1:27:11] led him over and Deus Shakarion either
[1:27:15] was the president or became the
[1:27:16] president and opened up cities all over
[1:27:20] the all over the North America for him
[1:27:23] to go and it was one of the last doors
[1:27:25] that was open to him. And there he's
[1:27:28] blasting it out in 1965
[1:27:31] to the churches and the doors and the
[1:27:33] chapters that were opened and birth
[1:27:35] pains. I was listening to it yesterday
[1:27:37] and there he is speaking it out and he
[1:27:40] said he was so thankful some of these
[1:27:41] doors were still remaining open to
[1:27:43] brother Carl Williams of the full gospel
[1:27:46] businessmen and and I thought oh God
[1:27:49] from that one statement and God led me
[1:27:54] over how he could say as it was with
[1:27:58] Eleazar and you have brought me to my
[1:28:02] father's to my my master's kindred head.
[1:28:07] &gt;&gt; I'm finding her.
[1:28:12] &gt;&gt; He said there was a doctor Theodore
[1:28:14] Palovius
[1:28:18] and that was a doctor for Mrs.
[1:28:21] Shakarion.
[1:28:24] And when brother Brandham came in there,
[1:28:25] he said the very idea you building up
[1:28:28] the you building the people under a
[1:28:30] false conception. He said you're giving
[1:28:32] them a false hope. And he said, "The
[1:28:35] woman is laying there dying and she had
[1:28:38] had both breasts removed and her body
[1:28:40] was all swelled up." He says, "And I
[1:28:43] went into the house." He says, "And now
[1:28:44] when you go in, the doctor said, "Be
[1:28:47] reverent and quiet
[1:28:49] because the woman's dying." Now, he just
[1:28:52] been knew that he just been sent over.
[1:28:54] He saw that name. He's been sent over
[1:28:58] responding to the telegram and the
[1:29:01] doctor is telling him, "Don't distress
[1:29:03] her. Don't just be quiet.
[1:29:06] She's a dying woman.
[1:29:09] Be real reverent."
[1:29:12] And so he knelt down to pray. And when I
[1:29:14] did, he says, "There came the angel of
[1:29:17] the Lord down to the bed and said, in
[1:29:20] three days she'll be up.
[1:29:25] [Applause]
[1:29:27] And here came the doctor Polyovius
[1:29:30] and was going to run me out of the
[1:29:32] house. And he said, "The very idea,
[1:29:36] well, building those people under a
[1:29:38] false hope, that woman's dying." And I
[1:29:42] said, "According to all your statistics,
[1:29:45] it is, but according to the word of the
[1:29:48] Lord, no."
[1:29:51] I said, "She's going to live." And he
[1:29:53] said, "Nonsense." He said, "You should
[1:29:55] leave this place and get out of here."
[1:29:58] And he said, and brother Shakarion
[1:30:01] stepped up and said, "Wait a moment." He
[1:30:04] said, "We had you down here also
[1:30:08] as our doctor, and we appreciate you,
[1:30:11] but we also we also called Brother
[1:30:14] Brham. Your hopes, you gave us none.
[1:30:19] &gt;&gt; He does."
[1:30:21] And I said, "Tell you what I'll do." He
[1:30:25] said, "If she isn't up again within 3
[1:30:28] days, I'll put a sign on my back. False
[1:30:33] prophet, and you can go right through
[1:30:36] here in Los Angeles, get in your car, go
[1:30:40] down the street blowing your horn and
[1:30:43] pointing to me. And then if she is up,
[1:30:47] let me put a sign on your back." quack
[1:30:50] doctor
[1:30:52] &gt;&gt; and get in your car and blow the horn.
[1:30:55] And I can tell you she wasn't only up in
[1:30:57] three days. She lived for many, many,
[1:30:59] many years.
[1:31:04] And brother Brandon was not
[1:31:07] he was not the kind of man that would
[1:31:10] make him put a sign on his back. But you
[1:31:12] know what happened? You know what
[1:31:14] happened?
[1:31:16] He said, "I was sent."
[1:31:19] You know what happened to Dr. Pavolas?
[1:31:22] He said, "Baptize me.
[1:31:25] &gt;&gt; I'll receive this kind of Jesus Christ.
[1:31:27] Baptize me." And the messenger sent to
[1:31:30] him.
[1:31:32] &gt;&gt; And God through that brought the man to
[1:31:34] redemption, salvation, and then the
[1:31:38] doors swung open. And I'm so glad they
[1:31:41] did. You ought to go through the
[1:31:43] messages and hear the titles of the
[1:31:45] messages that were spoken in Christian
[1:31:47] businessmen international conventions or
[1:31:50] at their chapters and brother Brandham
[1:31:52] said help them to establish many many
[1:31:54] chapters. What am I saying friends that
[1:31:56] they were called
[1:31:58] &gt;&gt; but they were also sent.
[1:32:00] &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham was called of God but
[1:32:03] he was sent of God.
[1:32:04] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen?
[1:32:06] &gt;&gt; You have been called of God but you have
[1:32:08] been sent of God. Hallelujah. Don't ever
[1:32:12] forget it. You've been sent.
[1:32:14] &gt;&gt; You're sent to your children. You're
[1:32:15] sent to your wife. You're sent to your
[1:32:17] husband. You're sent to this church.
[1:32:22] &gt;&gt; We're under an awesome responsibility
[1:32:24] before God to live honorable.
[1:32:27] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. To edify the body of Christ.
[1:32:30] We've been sent.
[1:32:32] &gt;&gt; I haven't been sent to be a failure.
[1:32:33] You've been sent to be a success.
[1:32:38] &gt;&gt; We're not sent to drag people down. were
[1:32:40] sent to lift him up.
[1:32:48] &gt;&gt; I'm wondering how God sent for you.
[1:32:51] He said, "God looked down
[1:32:54] through the stream of time and saw every
[1:32:56] man that would be saved." God looked
[1:32:59] down through the stream of time and saw
[1:33:02] every person, every man, every woman,
[1:33:04] every one of you that are here. God, he
[1:33:06] said, "Look down through the stream of
[1:33:08] time.
[1:33:09] and saw you. And because he saw you, he
[1:33:12] sent just exactly the right kind of
[1:33:14] mingling of history. He He knew exactly
[1:33:19] every verse you'd read in the Bible.
[1:33:21] &gt;&gt; And he knew precisely the one that you'd
[1:33:24] read when he'd send his spirit upon you
[1:33:26] and move you and and and you'd well up
[1:33:28] with an emotion within say, "Oh, God, I
[1:33:31] I I that is having such an effect on
[1:33:34] me." God knew that.
[1:33:36] &gt;&gt; God ordained that. And that man, that
[1:33:39] woman when they lived their life back
[1:33:40] there was actually being sent to you.
[1:33:44] &gt;&gt; Their testimony would be sent to you on
[1:33:46] the pages called the word of God the
[1:33:48] Bible.
[1:33:49] &gt;&gt; Are you getting my point?
[1:33:55] &gt;&gt; And God by his in infinity
[1:33:58] looked down through the stream of time
[1:34:00] and saw every man that would be saved,
[1:34:03] every man. And he knew it by
[1:34:06] fornowledge.
[1:34:08] And we must know, we must know that we
[1:34:12] have been sent
[1:34:15] to those that are around us and to our
[1:34:17] generation.
[1:34:20] In the message why it had to be
[1:34:21] shepherds,
[1:34:23] notice he said, "As a father," and he's
[1:34:26] quoting the scriptures, "The father sent
[1:34:28] me as Jesus said, "So send I you." The
[1:34:32] father that sent him went in him to
[1:34:36] confirm the word.
[1:34:38] &gt;&gt; The father that called you
[1:34:41] &gt;&gt; has sent you
[1:34:44] &gt;&gt; and goes in you.
[1:34:48] &gt;&gt; Can you
[1:34:49] &gt;&gt; go with me there? Amen.
[1:34:51] &gt;&gt; The father that called you, the father
[1:34:53] that sealed you with the Holy Spirit is
[1:34:56] the same one that goes with you
[1:34:58] &gt;&gt; to confirm
[1:34:59] &gt;&gt; that you are not only called but you
[1:35:01] also been sent.
[1:35:03] [Applause]
[1:35:04] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:35:06] &gt;&gt; And he said, "And as the the same Jesus
[1:35:08] that sends his people goes in the people
[1:35:12] that he sends."
[1:35:14] and why it had to be shepherd. It would
[1:35:16] be good for you to take these phrases so
[1:35:18] that you can remember this service this
[1:35:21] morning. It will not be forgotten. I
[1:35:22] pray in Christ is a mystery of God. He
[1:35:25] said, I don't want you to miss this. And
[1:35:28] as the father has sent me, so send you.
[1:35:32] He quotes the scripture. Jesus said, the
[1:35:35] father that sent him went in him to
[1:35:39] vindicate himself, right? For he was the
[1:35:43] word. And the same Jesus that sends you
[1:35:47] goes with you and in you to vindicate
[1:35:51] the same God. That's a mouthful.
[1:35:54] &gt;&gt; The same God that went in Jesus Christ.
[1:35:58] And Jesus goes in you to confirm that it
[1:36:02] is him.
[1:36:04] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. That's supernatural,
[1:36:06] friends.
[1:36:08] And as the father hath sent me, and I
[1:36:11] live by the father, so send you, and you
[1:36:14] live by me. What is he? He is the word.
[1:36:17] You live by the message of the hour, my
[1:36:20] brother, my sister. You live by the word
[1:36:22] of God.
[1:36:25] The same God that called you goes with
[1:36:28] you.
[1:36:45] I'm just looking here. See what I want
[1:36:48] to There's several times
[1:36:53] I want to read
[1:36:56] and I would I would ask that this might
[1:36:58] be you might want to know where this is.
[1:37:02] listen to this prayer very closely.
[1:37:06] And I believe that every one of you can
[1:37:10] pray this prayer.
[1:37:13] Now, Satan,
[1:37:15] how many of you ever had to talk to
[1:37:17] Satan, tell him to do a thing or two?
[1:37:20] Now, Satan,
[1:37:22] I know you're holding this people.
[1:37:26] Dark, gloomy, hideous things holding
[1:37:29] over them, saying, "Well, I'll make a
[1:37:32] try at it." But I want to speak to you.
[1:37:35] I stand in their place between them and
[1:37:39] God this morning. I stand as a servant
[1:37:42] of the almighty God. My sins are gone
[1:37:45] through the blood of Jesus Christ by
[1:37:47] divine faith. Can you say that? Can you
[1:37:50] say amen to that?
[1:37:52] &gt;&gt; My sins are all gone are gone through
[1:37:54] the blood of Jesus Christ by divine
[1:37:56] faith and that I have in him as the son
[1:37:59] of God. And I claim and the Bible claims
[1:38:02] first and I speak as the Bible that he
[1:38:06] spoiled every power that you ever had at
[1:38:09] Calvary. Can we say amen? Amen.
[1:38:11] &gt;&gt; And the Bible claims that his disciples
[1:38:14] are to carry his commission that he had
[1:38:17] here on earth to the end of the age. Can
[1:38:20] you say amen?
[1:38:21] &gt;&gt; And we're there.
[1:38:26] &gt;&gt; And I am his disciple. Can you say amen?
[1:38:30] &gt;&gt; How many disciples? I want you to make a
[1:38:32] confession. I am his disciple.
[1:38:37] &gt;&gt; I come as a representative. as a
[1:38:40] representative of Jesus Christ in his
[1:38:42] actions. And here it is. I am sent in
[1:38:46] his place.
[1:38:48] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:38:49] &gt;&gt; These are bold statements. I would like
[1:38:51] every person, young, old, and whatever,
[1:38:53] whoever can understand me that ought to
[1:38:55] be able to say that I have been sent in
[1:38:58] his place. Jesus Jesus hasn't got shoe
[1:39:01] leather on like I have this morning.
[1:39:03] He's not in contact physically with this
[1:39:06] world, but I have been sent to this age,
[1:39:09] to this time, to this people.
[1:39:14] &gt;&gt; You've got to believe that
[1:39:16] &gt;&gt; because that's what the Bible teaches.
[1:39:19] I've sent you.
[1:39:21] &gt;&gt; And he said, I and he's telling the
[1:39:22] devil, I've been washed in the blood. My
[1:39:26] sins are forgiven. And I'm
[1:39:28] representative of Almighty God according
[1:39:31] to the scripture.
[1:39:33] and I am sent in his place and and and
[1:39:37] what whenever I call over the person,
[1:39:40] your power will break.
[1:39:42] &gt;&gt; Oh my friends, is this just a story? Is
[1:39:45] this just a prayer? Or is this a
[1:39:47] confidence that he had in God? And is
[1:39:50] this just for him? He said in the church
[1:39:52] ages that the that the every messenger
[1:39:54] had his wick in the oil.
[1:39:57] &gt;&gt; And it was not for the messenger only.
[1:40:00] But it was for all of them of that age.
[1:40:04] &gt;&gt; It's for you this morning. If you want
[1:40:06] to live in the hog pen, go ahead. But I
[1:40:09] am urging you to get out of it.
[1:40:12] &gt;&gt; If you want to live on meager fair and
[1:40:14] starve to death, that's up to you. But
[1:40:16] you don't have to. Amen.
[1:40:19] &gt;&gt; And nobody here is is no one can say I
[1:40:22] don't understand that. Of course you
[1:40:24] understand it.
[1:40:25] &gt;&gt; Of course you grasp it.
[1:40:27] &gt;&gt; You've been sent to this generation.
[1:40:30] &gt;&gt; And now you must stand up and make a
[1:40:33] declaration. And he said to the Satan, I
[1:40:36] now challenge you in the name of the
[1:40:38] name of Jesus Christ. In his blood I
[1:40:41] stand and you leave every person who I
[1:40:44] lay my hands upon. Not in my holiness.
[1:40:47] Not in my name. For my name is nothing
[1:40:50] to you. My holiness is nothing. He's
[1:40:54] talking to the devil. I have none. But
[1:40:58] you won't recognize my name, but you'll
[1:41:01] recognize Jesus name.
[1:41:05] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:41:07] &gt;&gt; And you're going to come out.
[1:41:09] &gt;&gt; Glory to God.
[1:41:11] &gt;&gt; Is that just for him? Is that just
[1:41:13] history? Or is that right now? and
[1:41:15] you're going to come out.
[1:41:18] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:41:20] &gt;&gt; When I lay my hands on and pray, you're
[1:41:22] going to come out.
[1:41:24] &gt;&gt; Your power is broken. My sins are
[1:41:27] forgiven. This is the Bible standing
[1:41:29] here. Not the Bible in a book.
[1:41:32] &gt;&gt; Not just this is a Bible standing here.
[1:41:38] &gt;&gt; It's the word of God
[1:41:40] being lived out. And the Christ who
[1:41:43] said, "As God has sent me, so send I
[1:41:45] you. I've been sent."
[1:41:48] &gt;&gt; I'll tell you what, if this church could
[1:41:49] realize that, if this church could
[1:41:51] realize that, it would change it. It
[1:41:54] would change the dynamics.
[1:42:00] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:42:03] &gt;&gt; You won't recognize my name. It doesn't
[1:42:05] mean anything. But he says, "I go now in
[1:42:07] a challenge." and you try to hold any of
[1:42:10] these people, may the curse of God come
[1:42:13] upon you. He's saying to the devil, may
[1:42:16] the curse of God come upon you. He needs
[1:42:18] to have five or 6 hundred people here
[1:42:20] today announce to him and I challenge
[1:42:23] you and may the curse of God come upon
[1:42:25] you in this day.
[1:42:30] says you're he says you may get out and
[1:42:33] take your hand off of these Christians.
[1:42:35] You're dirty, sickening, hand afflicting
[1:42:38] and crippling and sickening these people
[1:42:40] and giving them diseases. You take your
[1:42:43] hand off in the name of Jesus Christ. He
[1:42:46] realized he was sent
[1:42:49] &gt;&gt; and he gave himself to it. Jesus was
[1:42:52] sent. Paul was sent. I'm going to say I
[1:42:55] want to add one more thing because I'm
[1:42:57] coming to the where I want to close.
[1:43:01] being sent
[1:43:03] bringing as it were birth.
[1:43:06] It's always been associated with
[1:43:08] travail.
[1:43:10] &gt;&gt; It doesn't come easy.
[1:43:13] &gt;&gt; That's why the prophet said Eleazar he
[1:43:16] had an awful time.
[1:43:18] &gt;&gt; We know nothing about his journey.
[1:43:21] I tell you that you can be sure that
[1:43:24] Satan tried to prevent him.
[1:43:25] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:43:27] &gt;&gt; He just didn't. He he had a commission.
[1:43:29] He was commanded of his master Abraham.
[1:43:34] And shall I bring it twice? Shall I
[1:43:36] bring the son back or shall I return
[1:43:39] your son to the your kindred? Beware
[1:43:43] that you don't do that. That's not going
[1:43:44] to happen. You have to bring her here.
[1:43:48] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:43:49] &gt;&gt; These that believe, oh, we're going to
[1:43:51] just see the heavens open and and some
[1:43:53] big carpet come down. on. It's it's just
[1:43:56] a a figment of their imagination. That's
[1:43:58] not the way it's going to happen.
[1:44:00] There's going to be a group of people.
[1:44:02] We that are alive and remain shall be
[1:44:04] caught up together with them that are
[1:44:06] resurrected to meet the Lord in the air.
[1:44:08] Is that the scripture? Is that the
[1:44:11] Bible? That's what we believe.
[1:44:13] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And devil, you cannot hold
[1:44:16] them that are in the graves, that are
[1:44:17] asleep in Christ, for they're going to
[1:44:19] rise according to this word of God.
[1:44:22] Hallelujah. This word of God that's not
[1:44:25] only written but is living in the
[1:44:27] people.
[1:44:28] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:44:30] &gt;&gt; Glory to God.
[1:44:32] &gt;&gt; Tell my brother, my sister, we could
[1:44:34] keep you here quite a while but I don't
[1:44:36] want to. But there was birth pains and
[1:44:38] that is why Paul said I travail and
[1:44:40] birth again for you.
[1:44:43] &gt;&gt; Mary when she was conceived of the Holy
[1:44:45] Ghost, she had travail and brought forth
[1:44:48] a son.
[1:44:49] Israel had travail. And the prophet
[1:44:51] said, "Under every prophet's voice,
[1:44:54] Israel was in travail." The nation was
[1:44:56] in travail because the old has to die.
[1:44:59] And there may be some things here that
[1:45:00] need to die this morning. You got to die
[1:45:03] to your own concepts. Die to your own
[1:45:05] ideas. Die to your own little uh
[1:45:08] whatever it might be, things that are so
[1:45:10] precious to you or whatever more. You
[1:45:12] need to die to it. Die to your agenda
[1:45:15] and accept that of the Holy Spirit.
[1:45:19] Glory to God.
[1:45:20] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:45:22] &gt;&gt; That a new life can be brought forth.
[1:45:24] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:45:25] &gt;&gt; Glory to God.
[1:45:27] &gt;&gt; It takes pain to bring forth sons and
[1:45:29] daughters. So, not only have you been
[1:45:31] called, but you have been sent. Yes,
[1:45:34] sir.
[1:45:34] &gt;&gt; And let it be known to you when one is
[1:45:36] sent. It isn't always easy. You may go
[1:45:39] through an awful time finding that one
[1:45:41] with character
[1:45:43] &gt;&gt; and the Holy Spirit starts to work on
[1:45:45] them and your life begins to affect them
[1:45:50] and then they come
[1:45:52] and are united to this lovely bridegroom
[1:45:56] Jesus Christ. Be it known to you
[1:46:00] that one day, more real than you are
[1:46:03] here this morning,
[1:46:06] you're going to have someone run up,
[1:46:09] shake your hand,
[1:46:11] &gt;&gt; say, "Who are you?" Well, you don't
[1:46:14] remember me. No, I certainly don't. When
[1:46:17] we were on earth, you lived next to me.
[1:46:21] &gt;&gt; You worked in a factory beside me.
[1:46:24] &gt;&gt; You went to school. You sat in the seat
[1:46:26] next to me. You sat ahead of me. I
[1:46:28] watched you. I watched how you did
[1:46:30] things. I watched when you said yes and
[1:46:31] I watched when you said no. And I saw
[1:46:34] Christ in you.
[1:46:36] &gt;&gt; Be it known to you that this Holy Spirit
[1:46:38] of God is working through his people
[1:46:42] calling. You've been sent my people.
[1:46:44] You've been sent of God to this
[1:46:46] generation.
[1:46:52] I don't want to spend any time on my
[1:46:53] personal,
[1:46:55] but I'll tell you what, friends.
[1:46:58] Sitting on the 19th floor of the Toronto
[1:47:01] Dominion building in Toronto, and I just
[1:47:05] found out after I told this last
[1:47:07] testimony that our brother Curt Steiner
[1:47:09] was a chef up on the top floor.
[1:47:13] He was higher up.
[1:47:17] up there about 50 floors or so, wasn't
[1:47:20] it, brother? 57 or something up there as
[1:47:23] a chef in the same building. Here we
[1:47:25] are.
[1:47:26] Hasn't God got a sense of humor?
[1:47:29] &gt;&gt; Says, "I'm going to take a little guy
[1:47:30] out of the 19th floor and I'm going to
[1:47:32] take a chef out of the 57th floor and
[1:47:33] I'm going to have them fellowshipping
[1:47:34] together in the same church over in a
[1:47:36] hicktown called Cloverdale."
[1:47:40] &gt;&gt; Who can figure that out, Brother David?
[1:47:42] &gt;&gt; Who can figure that out?
[1:47:47] I was sitting there trying to put
[1:47:50] together things and negotiate and all
[1:47:52] the rest of it and something down
[1:47:54] inside. You're going to leave this.
[1:47:57] You're going to leave this. You're going
[1:48:00] to leave this.
[1:48:02] Let me get that out of my mind. I've
[1:48:05] been waiting for this all my life. How
[1:48:08] in the world can I be leaving it? It's
[1:48:10] just some wild thought. I just put it
[1:48:12] out of my mind and I lay on bed and
[1:48:16] wherever it was that nagging inside
[1:48:20] to finally said okay
[1:48:23] what do you want Lord
[1:48:26] I want you to go west
[1:48:28] where I don't have any idea
[1:48:32] as I studied and prayed and waited on
[1:48:35] Lord for this
[1:48:38] on one hand I was being called
[1:48:41] and On the other hand, I was being sent
[1:48:46] &gt;&gt; and I've been sent here.
[1:48:48] &gt;&gt; And I've been sent to
[1:48:51] do all that I can. Everything that is
[1:48:54] possible that God will allow me to do.
[1:48:56] I've been sent to have an effect and to
[1:48:58] be an influence and to stand stable and
[1:49:01] stand steady. And God help us. Help us
[1:49:04] each one. And you've been sent. God
[1:49:07] called you, but you came in and you've
[1:49:10] been sent now. And may God cause us to
[1:49:13] be fruitful in the land.
[1:49:15] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And my precious brothers and
[1:49:18] sisters, whatever part that you are
[1:49:21] here, I want to say you're a lovely
[1:49:25] Rebecca. You're a lovely bride. And
[1:49:28] don't let anybody ever say anything
[1:49:30] different. It's lovely what God has put
[1:49:32] together. It's lovely that God has
[1:49:35] called you. Hallelujah. And you need to
[1:49:37] honor that. You need to respect that and
[1:49:40] at the same time confess without any
[1:49:44] hesitancy. And I have been sent. And
[1:49:47] when you run into a snag, you run into
[1:49:49] the devil. You you say the same prayer
[1:49:52] brother Brandham said. I challenge you,
[1:49:54] Satan. You're looking at somebody that's
[1:49:56] been washed in the blood of Jesus
[1:49:58] Christ. You know nothing about this.
[1:50:00] You're looking at somebody that has
[1:50:01] truth in them. You know nothing about
[1:50:03] this. You're full of lies. You're full
[1:50:06] of impurity. You're vile. You're
[1:50:08] unclean. And I've been washed in the
[1:50:10] blood of Jesus Christ.
[1:50:13] I challenge you. Take your hand off my
[1:50:16] property.
[1:50:17] &gt;&gt; Be gone.
[1:50:19] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:50:22] &gt;&gt; You say, "Well, does it work?" Of course
[1:50:24] it works.
[1:50:26] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:50:28] &gt;&gt; God bless you, sent ones.
[1:50:31] &gt;&gt; I'm so glad he came to me. Amen.
[1:50:33] &gt;&gt; When I couldn't go to him, he came to
[1:50:35] me.
[1:50:36] &gt;&gt; Let's thank him as we pray. Father,
[1:50:40] how grateful we are.
[1:50:43] &gt;&gt; I'm so thankful, Lord, had I not obeyed
[1:50:47] that little small voice inside
[1:50:50] telling me to leave and to go to some
[1:50:52] place, not knowing where, there was no
[1:50:55] family there, not knowing what you had
[1:50:58] in your mind. But here today, Lord,
[1:51:00] these many years later, and I see the
[1:51:03] glorious beauty of
[1:51:07] your creation, the new creation in your
[1:51:11] people, and see how marvelously and
[1:51:14] miraculously you called them and
[1:51:16] gathered them. And Lord, they also know,
[1:51:19] and I've just been confirming to them
[1:51:21] today, and I believe your Holy Spirit
[1:51:24] has been witnessing that they have been
[1:51:26] sent. They are sent ones with a uh
[1:51:31] particular mission and commission. And I
[1:51:35] pray, oh God, you'll bless them along
[1:51:37] the way. I pray that you will bless them
[1:51:40] and make them fruitful in their land and
[1:51:42] where they journey and the places that
[1:51:45] they work and the mothers in their home
[1:51:48] and the young people in their halls of
[1:51:50] learning and wherever they may be. May
[1:51:52] they know, oh God. I pray for our
[1:51:55] school, Father, our brother Randy
[1:51:57] Timberman, the principal, Lord, and all
[1:51:59] the teachers. I pray for them this
[1:52:01] morning that they may enter their
[1:52:03] classrooms, Lord, tomorrow, realizing
[1:52:06] they've been sent to these precious
[1:52:08] ones, oh Father. I pray, oh God, that
[1:52:12] mothers and fathers and and all that are
[1:52:14] here, grandparents and whatever more, oh
[1:52:17] God, we'll realize the awesome
[1:52:19] responsibility of being one sent. We
[1:52:22] have a certain message. We can't vary
[1:52:24] from it. Bless our brothers and sisters,
[1:52:27] Lord. all that are within the sound of
[1:52:30] my voice. I pray that you will bless
[1:52:32] them abundantly, abundantly. Send your
[1:52:35] Holy Spirit upon them. And when their
[1:52:37] mouth opens, may glorious utterances
[1:52:40] come forth. Jesus prosper your work. I
[1:52:45] pray.
[1:52:48] And this evening as our brother Anatoli
[1:52:50] is here amongst us. Oh God,
[1:52:54] may I ask you to bless father in a
[1:52:57] special way, his wife and his family,
[1:53:00] children, and the work where he is,
[1:53:03] Lord, and not having a lot of
[1:53:06] fellowship. I pray that you'll
[1:53:08] strengthen them. I pray that you will
[1:53:10] encourage them, Lord, and lead them on
[1:53:13] in the way. For there is no doubt in my
[1:53:16] heart but what you have called them and
[1:53:19] you have sent our brother to his people.
[1:53:22] And now Lord, I ask that you be with us
[1:53:25] throughout this afternoon.
[1:53:27] And may our conversation be edifying one
[1:53:31] to another.
[1:53:33] Jesus, Jesus, we are your disciples.
[1:53:39] And if there's anyone here that has
[1:53:42] listened to the word today, Lord, and
[1:53:43] they have some struggle. They've been
[1:53:46] weighing things out in their mind, I
[1:53:48] pray that they will cast it all. Cast it
[1:53:51] all down at your feet. Say, Lord, here's
[1:53:54] my life. Here's all that I am or all
[1:53:56] that I ever can be in Jesus Christ's
[1:53:59] name.
[1:54:00] Touch the afflicted, Lord. Touch those
[1:54:03] that are afflicted. You have done so
[1:54:05] many wonderful things for us. Oh God, I
[1:54:08] want to thank you for it. You didn't
[1:54:10] have to do it, but you did do it.
[1:54:13] Grace, grace, marvelous grace. Glory to
[1:54:18] your name. Glory to your name. Blessed
[1:54:21] be the name of Jesus. Let us all rise
[1:54:23] and just speak out of your heart.
[1:54:27] Thanksgiving to him.
[1:54:29] &gt;&gt; Lord, we give you praise. We give you
[1:54:32] glory. We take this time to give honor
[1:54:36] to you, to give glory to you. How worthy
[1:54:41] you are, Lord.
[1:54:44] Worthy you are.
[1:54:47] Oh, how worthy you are, Lord. How worthy
[1:54:50] you are.
[1:54:54] &gt;&gt; Precious lamb of God.
[1:54:58] [Music]
[1:55:01] Bless the Lord. Bless the Lord. Bless
[1:55:04] the Lord. Saying he came to me.
[1:55:07] [Music]
[1:55:16] He came
[1:55:18] to me.
[1:55:23] He came
[1:55:25] to me.
[1:55:30] I could not come
[1:55:34] to where he was.
[1:55:37] He came.
[1:55:39] [Music]
[1:55:44] That's why he died
[1:55:47] [Music]
[1:55:50] on Calary.
[1:55:54] [Music]
[1:55:57] I could not come
[1:56:01] to where he was.
[1:56:04] He came to me.
[1:56:10] He came to me.
[1:56:14] &gt;&gt; Oh, bless his holy name.
[1:56:17] He came to me.
[1:56:21] [Music]
[1:56:24] I could not come
[1:56:28] to where he was.
[1:56:30] He came free.
[1:56:37] That's why he died
[1:56:41] [Music]
[1:56:43] on Calary
[1:56:46] [Applause]
[1:56:49] that could not come
[1:56:54] to where he was.
[1:56:56] He came to me.
[1:57:01] There might be a prodal son
[1:57:04] or a prodal daughter here today
[1:57:08] or one that's not in the building, but
[1:57:10] there's a believer here.
[1:57:14] And I'm sure the heart of the father is
[1:57:17] in you.
[1:57:19] Your yearning is for him. Your yearning
[1:57:22] is for her. And many times you look
[1:57:25] spiritually out over the horizon.
[1:57:28] Is he coming? Is he coming?
[1:57:32] Is he coming?
[1:57:34] [Music]
[1:57:39] I wonder if this is the day
[1:57:42] [Music]
[1:57:45] I'd love to have a part.
[1:57:49] I'd love to be rewarded on the other
[1:57:51] side just with
[1:57:55] you are faithful.
[1:57:57] You spoke.
[1:58:00] You lingered in the service.
[1:58:03] You said some things.
[1:58:05] As we stood at the graveside of our
[1:58:07] sister Marge Miller just getting ready
[1:58:09] to let the people depart and the Holy
[1:58:11] Spirit just came and words were uttering
[1:58:14] out of my mouth to the family.
[1:58:18] You must not say goodbye here when you
[1:58:22] have the opportunity just to say
[1:58:23] farewell. We must not miss those
[1:58:26] opportunities. Those they just come in a
[1:58:28] moment of time and maybe it's just
[1:58:30] something special happening here in your
[1:58:32] heart and speaking in a certain way. And
[1:58:35] you must not pass the opportunity say,
[1:58:38] "Oh God, give me grace now to do what I
[1:58:41] need to do. I'll deny the enemy. I'll
[1:58:43] deny the devil. I will not be his
[1:58:46] servant anymore.
[1:58:50] I'm going to give myself
[1:58:53] I'd love to be able to have an
[1:58:54] opportunity.
[1:58:56] Pray with you if you're that one.
[1:59:00] So, the minister's here.
[1:59:05] Don't escape it. He's come for you.
[1:59:10] Be like Rebecca.
[1:59:14] Will you go?
[1:59:18] Will you go? Say yes, I will go.
[1:59:23] Yes, I will go.
[1:59:27] He came
[1:59:29] to me.
[1:59:33] He came
[1:59:36] to me
[1:59:40] when I could not come
[1:59:45] to where he was.
[1:59:48] He came to me.
[1:59:53] [Music]
[1:59:54] That's why he
[2:00:00] once
[2:00:03] [Music]
[2:00:15] he came to me.
[2:00:18] &gt;&gt; We're going to sing it one more time.
[2:00:20] And I would just say to anyone
[2:00:24] [Music]
[2:00:25] if there's something that's not just
[2:00:27] exactly right
[2:00:29] and you know that God has spoken to you
[2:00:34] and is urging you now
[2:00:37] saying this is the moment
[2:00:40] then you've come.
[2:00:42] There could be a time when you want to
[2:00:44] come, but if God's not drawing you, it
[2:00:47] just it will not be the same.
[2:00:51] But if you need to come, we're just
[2:00:53] going to sing it once more and then
[2:00:56] we'll be closing the service for all
[2:00:57] that need to dismiss.
[2:01:00] He came
[2:01:02] to me.
[2:01:05] I ask the minister and brothers to come
[2:01:07] and help. He came to me.
[2:01:12] [Music]
[2:01:14] When I could not come
[2:01:18] to where he was,
[2:01:21] he came to me.
[2:01:24] [Music]
[2:01:28] That's why he died
[2:01:34] on Calary.
[2:01:37] [Applause]
[2:01:39] [Music]
[2:01:40] And I could not come
[2:01:45] to where he was.
[2:01:47] He came.
[2:01:51] &gt;&gt; Pass me not, oh gentle savior. Pass me
[2:01:53] none.
[2:01:57] &gt;&gt; Pass
[2:01:59] me not. Oh gentle. will save

[2:02:19] [Music]
[2:02:20] and
[2:02:26] I call
[2:02:33] you
[2:02:36] pass.
[2:02:44] Oh,
[2:02:50] in the name of Jesus Christ, I claim my
[2:02:53] brother to be a witness, to be a
[2:02:55] testimony, not only one called, but one
[2:02:58] strength. And Satan, you have no part of
[2:03:01] him.
[2:03:13] [Music]
[2:03:21] [Applause]
[2:03:22] Do not pass me by
[2:03:26] the Savior.
[2:03:32] Heat. Heat. Heat.

[2:12:29] Dear heavenly father God, what a
[2:12:32] privilege it is, Lord, to speak your
[2:12:34] name, Lord Jesus, and for all you've
[2:12:37] done for us, Lord Jesus, for the grace,
[2:12:40] Lord God, on our lives, Lord, for the
[2:12:44] calling you've had on our lives, Lord
[2:12:46] Jesus. We thank you, God. How we can't
[2:12:49] give you thanks enough, Lord Jesus. Just
[2:12:52] we could thank you forever, Lord.
[2:12:54] We just want to be a people, Lord, that
[2:12:57] is that does your will, Lord Jesus. We
[2:13:00] just want to be sensitive, Lord, to what
[2:13:03] you want us to do in our lives, Lord
[2:13:05] God. We just thank you, Lord, for
[2:13:07] everything you've done. We thank you for
[2:13:10] Sister Marge Miller, Lord. Just thinking
[2:13:11] of her. Thank you for her life, Lord,
[2:13:13] and the testimony it's been, Lord God.
[2:13:15] Let us just look to that, Lord Jesus.
[2:13:17] And just so when we leave this world,
[2:13:21] maybe people can look at us the same as
[2:13:22] we look at her. Just an amazing walk
[2:13:25] with the Lord. Lord, we just pray that
[2:13:27] you'd bless her and the family, Lord
[2:13:29] God. And we just God, we ask for this
[2:13:32] service, Lord, this morning, Lord, that
[2:13:34] you've spoken, Lord. We just ask, Lord,
[2:13:36] that we could take this, Lord, and put
[2:13:39] it in our lives, Lord God, and just
[2:13:40] remember it, Lord. Let us not forget it,
[2:13:42] Lord Jesus. Let us use it, Lord God. and
[2:13:45] pray for these ones that came forward,
[2:13:47] Lord, that you would bless them, Lord
[2:13:48] God, and give them strength and courage,
[2:13:50] Lord. We just ask that you'd go with us
[2:13:52] this afternoon and be with our
[2:13:55] conversations, whatever we do, Lord. And
[2:13:56] we just ask for the service tonight,
[2:13:58] Lord, that you'd bre bless the speaker,
[2:14:00] Lord. And God, just let us get all we
[2:14:02] can out of it, Lord. Bless brother Ed,
[2:14:04] Lord, for his labor, Lord God. We just
[2:14:06] love him, Lord. We just thank you, Lord
[2:14:09] God, in Jesus Christ's name. Amen.
[2:14:13] Brother Jared. Amen. We're dismissing
[2:14:15] you all in the name of Jesus Christ. And
[2:14:17] we pray that you will go in this
[2:14:19] atmosphere and it'll remain with you
[2:14:22] throughout the afternoon and you'll come
[2:14:24] early 5:00. Our brother Anatoli, we're
