[22:58] this morning, like to invite you to go

[23:03] brother Tom to come. Brother Tom Ray,
[23:06] lead us in prayer this morning.
[23:09] Joel Waldner askked us to remember a
[23:12] friend. The doctors have said that
[23:16] she may have breast cancer. pray that
[23:18] God will make this trial a blessing for
[23:21] them and that they may be led to Christ
[23:24] through this experience, through this
[23:25] trial.
[23:28] Amen. If you have a need upon your heart
[23:29] this morning,
[23:32] just lift it before the Lord as we go to
[23:33] prayer. God bless you.
[23:36] [Music]
[23:37] Let's bow our heads in a word of prayer.
[23:40] Our dear precious heavenly father,
[23:46] you mean more than life to us this
[23:48] morning
[23:49] &gt;&gt; as we have gathered in this house,
[23:53] a house where we gather to lift up that
[23:55] holy name of the lovely Lord Jesus
[23:57] Christ.
[23:59] &gt;&gt; And we can say from the depths of our
[24:00] heart, you mean more than life to me.
[24:04] Father, we see this whole world. It's
[24:06] groping in darkness, but you've given us
[24:09] light to see. You've given us eyes to
[24:12] eyes to behold the glory of God.
[24:16] You've come by our way in the
[24:17] resurrection, Lord Jesus. And you've
[24:19] quickened a seed gene that dwells
[24:21] within. And so there's something Lord
[24:23] that is beating on the inside crying for
[24:25] more of you.
[24:27] crying for adoption, crying for a
[24:30] change, that the great I am would come
[24:33] down this morning in a special way,
[24:35] anointing our hearts to believe, for all
[24:38] things are possible to them that
[24:40] believe. As brother Joe has put this
[24:44] request forward, I'm sure there's many
[24:46] hands that are raised this morning as
[24:47] mine are. Those that have joined on the
[24:50] way of the internet, I'm sure their
[24:51] hearts are raised also knowing that you
[24:54] see the very thought and intent of every
[24:56] heart that is here. So Lord, great high
[24:58] priest, may we touch the hem of your
[25:00] garment this morning by faith, not
[25:03] looking to man, but looking to the great
[25:05] I am. For all things are possible this
[25:08] morning. Lord, would you touch the
[25:10] needy? Would you save the lost? Will you
[25:14] heal the sick? Lord, would the
[25:16] resurrection come by our way?
[25:18] meet with us in a special way. For the
[25:22] musicians, Lord, may it be a special
[25:24] encounter as they minister to your
[25:26] people. The soundmen, the video men.
[25:29] Lord, may you come by their way.
[25:32] Anointing them, Lord, as they offer
[25:35] their love gift to us. And as the pastor
[25:38] comes, anoint the gift, Lord. Anoint the
[25:42] man of God. Anoint our ears to hear. Let
[25:46] the spirit speak. May the Holy Ghost
[25:49] move. May lives be changed.
[25:53] May word upon word be deposited within
[25:56] our hearts. Lord, I feel a a charge
[25:59] within. God, move upon us, Lord, as we
[26:04] see the day approach.
[26:07] The hour of the change is upon us. May
[26:10] our eyes be turned heavenward.
[26:13] And may God you anoint this church like
[26:16] never before. May you meet us in a very
[26:19] special way. May all carnality go. May
[26:23] the expectation be high. May you move
[26:26] amongst us Lord Jesus meeting our every
[26:29] need. Bless us now
[26:33] in Jesus name. Amen.
[26:37] [Music]
[26:40] &gt;&gt; Amen. And God bless you each and
[26:42] everyone as you have your seats this
[26:43] morning. Say God bless you to those that
[26:46] are listening on the telephone hookup
[26:48] and on the internet hookup. Certainly
[26:50] want to say God bless you to you as
[26:52] well. Brother Gary St. John and his
[26:55] daughter and uh brother Nathan
[26:57] Hildebrandt have a special. So why don't
[26:59] they come and get ready this morning do
[27:02] have a quick announcement to let you
[27:04] know about. We do want to remember young
[27:06] peoples on Friday evening. this Friday

[27:43] energy and strength and put into the

[28:23] right to the word.
[28:26] He's glad to be walking down the road.
[28:28] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[28:29] &gt;&gt; I just looked up a quote. The the name
[28:30] of the song is there is a road and
[28:32] brother Brandham said going beyond the
[28:33] camp in 1964. He said notice as they
[28:35] went out into the wilderness there were
[28:37] miracles signs when they moved into the
[28:39] camp. Now remember they left Egypt's
[28:41] camp and moved out into the wilderness
[28:43] with God's camp. He said, "How do you
[28:45] know it was?" God said, "Your people
[28:47] will s shall s sojourn for 400 years,
[28:51] but I'll bring them out with a mighty
[28:53] hand." Yes, sir.
[28:53] &gt;&gt; And I'll give them this land there, and
[28:55] they'll be on their road by a vindicated
[28:57] light, a vindicated prophet with signs,
[29:00] wonders that God was in the camp.
[29:02] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[29:03] &gt;&gt; And they were on their road. They had a
[29:05] pillar of fire. They had a prophet. They
[29:07] had the mana. They had the living
[29:08] waters. Amen.
[29:10] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[29:10] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[29:12] &gt;&gt; Just came in.
[29:12] &gt;&gt; Little song we put together. Pray for us
[29:14] that the anointing would stake as it is
[29:17] here already.
[29:20] [Music]
[29:48] There is a way
[29:52] that leads to life.
[29:56] The few that find it never
[30:00] die.
[30:02] Pass mountain peaks
[30:06] graced white with snow.
[30:10] The way grows brighter as it goes.

[30:21] inside of you.
[30:24] &gt;&gt; Inside of me there is one too.
[30:31] No stumbling pilgrim
[30:35] in the dark.
[30:39] The road to Zion's in your heart.
[30:45] The river runs
[30:49] beside the road.
[30:53] It's waters living as they flow.
[31:00] In liquid voice
[31:03] the water calls
[31:07] on thirsty knees a pilgrim
[31:11] falls.
[31:14] There is a road
[31:18] inside of you.
[31:21] Inside of me there is one too.

[31:35] The road to science in your heart.
[31:42] Sometimes a shadow,
[31:46] dark and cold,
[31:50] lays like a mist across the road.
[31:56] But be encouraged
[32:00] by the side.
[32:03] Where there's a shadow, there's a light.
[32:10] There is a rope
[32:14] inside of you.
[32:17] Inside of me, there is one, too.
[32:24] &gt;&gt; No stumbling pilgrim
[32:28] in the dawn.
[32:31] The road to Zion's in your heart.
[32:38] Sometimes it's good
[32:41] to look back down.
[32:45] We've come so far we've gained such
[32:49] ground.
[32:51] But joy is not
[32:55] in where we've been.
[32:59] Joy is who's waiting at the end.
[33:05] There is a road
[33:09] inside of you.
[33:12] Inside of me, there is one, too.
[33:18] No stumbling pil.
[33:23] [Music]

[37:35] You desire to speak to your heart.
[37:39] It's a declaration this morning.
[37:42] Break what is your heart this morning.
[37:45] [Music]
[37:49] Holy,
[37:51] holy.
[37:54] I will bless
[37:57] his holy
[37:59] name
[38:02] for he is here.
[38:09] [Music]
[38:25] [Music]
[38:27] You will never
[38:30] be
[38:32] the same.
[38:36] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[38:38] That sounds good. You'll never be the
[38:40] same.
[38:43] I want to leave this place today being
[38:46] at a different level.
[38:48] &gt;&gt; We don't want to be the same as when we
[38:50] came in, do we? Amen.
[38:54] Uh
[38:55] I'm going to go to the word right away,
[38:57] but I thought I'd like to sing just
[38:58] before we do. Uh Lord, I just want I
[39:02] want to just thank you, Lord, for
[39:04] letting me hear thy word.
[39:07] We don't want to be just uh attendees
[39:11] this morning, but we want to hear. And
[39:14] it takes something more than us just
[39:16] being attentive. That's good. Being real
[39:20] uh and filled with expectation, that's
[39:22] good. But it just takes a little
[39:24] something more. And that's something
[39:26] divine.
[39:28] &gt;&gt; Give me an understanding. Open my mind.
[39:31] Let me hear what it is you're saying.
[39:34] Speak by your Holy Spirit. So I wonder,
[39:36] brother Derek, brother Ryan, if we can
[39:38] just sing that, please.
[39:42] &gt;&gt; Want to thank you, Lord. Oh, thank him
[39:46] for letting me hear your word.
[39:51] [Music]
[39:52] How my God
[39:56] the glory revealed in me
[40:03] for that special night
[40:07] when I saw your
[40:10] life wonderful
[40:13] with eternal life
[40:18] I thank you let's sing the verse first
[40:21] verse
[40:23] to open my eyes.
[40:32] All the angel I was living in was
[40:42] then I heard recognizing your name
[40:48] and perfect
[40:53] and the message of praise.
[40:59] [Music]
[41:02] I just want to thank you Lord
[41:06] for letting me hear your word.
[41:11] I am I
[41:14] [Music]
[41:16] glorify
[41:20] [Music]
[41:30] [Music]
[41:41] Even in my wildest dreams
[41:45] I see I see the Is that true
[41:51] of the Lord the rapture mystery
[41:56] [Music]
[41:59] I heard by
[42:04] God simplicity
[42:08] the strong Where is your
[42:13] Lord? I thank you.
[42:26] [Music]
[42:29] My son
[42:36] [Music]
[42:43] glorious
[42:45] [Music]
[42:46] face to face with eternal life. Lord, I
[42:52] thank you.
[42:56] And we do thank you, Lord.
[42:59] [Music]
[43:00] We do thank you. We thank you,
[43:06] Lord. This is a special moment.
[43:10] We're together.
[43:12] We're together in a place of prayer, in
[43:14] a place of correction, in a place of
[43:17] revelation.
[43:20] We don't know how to thank you for
[43:21] hearing, allowing us to hear your word.
[43:26] I think of that special moment, that
[43:28] special time each one of us have it when
[43:31] it was as though the lights went on.
[43:34] A glorious glow,
[43:36] a glow of glory just spread upon our
[43:40] souls. Such a warmth and such a beauty.
[43:44] And from then on, it's been a glorious
[43:46] walk.
[43:48] how we thank you for this walk, oh God.
[43:52] And we're able once again to gather
[43:54] around your word. We're still here in
[43:55] the land of the living. So you have a
[43:58] purpose for us today. You have a
[44:00] purpose, Father, for each one that is
[44:02] here and each one that is streaming.
[44:05] Those, oh God, in other places and other
[44:07] lands. We ask, Father, that you will
[44:10] bless the bride of Jesus Christ with a
[44:14] special blessing. All those that
[44:16] minister, all those that stand behind
[44:18] the pullpit and seek to edify and build
[44:21] up the body of Christ. We have the
[44:24] promise that one day, oh God, and that's
[44:27] why we're here. One day truly, all of
[44:31] these natural things will pass away and
[44:34] we'll be in the perfection and the
[44:36] beauty of a restored Eden. Pray you'll
[44:38] bless us, oh God, today and anoint
[44:42] speaker and hearers
[44:44] I yield myself to you, Lord. I trust
[44:48] you'll cause me to say what should be
[44:50] said and that you'll bless the hearers.
[44:54] May it sink to the realm of the soul. I
[44:56] pray in Jesus name.
[44:59] Amen.
[45:00] &gt;&gt; Amen. Isn't it wonderful?
[45:03] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[45:05] I'll invite you to take your Bibles,
[45:07] please, and turn turn me with me to
[45:13] Revelation 21.
[45:23] Now I had asked if you would uh
[45:28] read future home and who is this Melzdc.
[45:33] Uh future home
[45:36] tells of our home a future home. and who
[45:40] is our Melzdc
[45:42] uh speaks a great deal about our body
[45:46] and the person that will be in that
[45:48] home. So that's what we want to uh speak
[45:53] about this morning.
[45:56] Brother Brandon said this Bible love
[45:58] letter
[46:00] is something God writes to us. He's hid
[46:03] it from the eyes of the wise and prudent
[46:07] and he will reveal it to babes such as
[46:09] would learn. So this Bible that we have
[46:12] and we'll be reading from is a love
[46:14] letter.
[46:16] Uh
[46:19] last Sunday I spoke on the a great voice
[46:23] out of heaven
[46:25] and it was very appropriate that brother
[46:28] Darren
[46:29] had
[46:31] shown to the people and yourself the new
[46:34] website
[46:36] with the with the hub to me. I don't
[46:39] even really call it I call it a massive
[46:42] library
[46:43] of the prophet's voice and his message
[46:47] uh in different languages. And to me it
[46:49] was it could only happen in this time.
[46:53] The Bible says
[46:55] in Isaiah and there's a lot of
[46:56] scriptures that have a lot of different
[46:58] meaning to us now. Excuse me. Thou shalt
[47:01] not hurt nor destroy in all my holy
[47:04] mountain. For the earth shall be full of
[47:07] the knowledge of the Lord as the waters
[47:09] cover the heavens or as the waters cover
[47:12] the sea and another place as the waters.
[47:14] And now the voice of God covers the
[47:17] earth.
[47:20] &gt;&gt; As the waters cover the sea.
[47:23] &gt;&gt; It couldn't happen in any other age.
[47:25] Amen.
[47:26] &gt;&gt; I've read that scripture many times and
[47:29] never even made sense to me really. I
[47:31] wondered how that was ever going to
[47:33] happen. But today, the word of God is
[47:36] encircling, the bleeding word is
[47:38] encircling this globe.
[47:40] &gt;&gt; Aren't you glad for that?
[47:43] &gt;&gt; And we've received it. We've received
[47:45] the sacrifice.
[47:47] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[47:50] So last Sunday we spoke of the future
[47:54] home more as a place prepared for the
[47:58] redeemed and a great voice from heaven
[48:01] that God has sent in our day to prepare
[48:03] us and to convey us to that place. Today
[48:07] I want to emphasize on on the our home
[48:12] as being this this our dwelling place.
[48:16] This is what God gave us to dwell in or
[48:19] home. This is your home.
[48:22] Say, "Well, I'm going home."
[48:25] Well, you wouldn't enjoy home very much
[48:29] if you were in some decrepit
[48:33] afflicted condition.
[48:35] In fact, they might take you to another
[48:37] place.
[48:40] Not too long ago, and I'm just keeping
[48:42] you standing for a moment. Not too long
[48:44] ago, I had a
[48:47] I had to take my aunt.
[48:50] My aunt has been very independent and
[48:53] very self-sufficient. And she doesn't
[48:57] need any financial help or anything. And
[48:59] she drives her own car. She just turned
[49:01] 80. And uh but she has sugar diabetes
[49:05] and she wasn't looking after it. And she
[49:07] was in bad condition. and they had to
[49:08] take her three three times in one month
[49:11] to by ambulance to the hospital. So
[49:15] there's she doesn't have any children.
[49:16] She doesn't have any family. I'm her
[49:18] nephew. She has another nephew and one
[49:21] great niece. And the three of us got
[49:24] together and said she and a doctor said
[49:27] she cannot go home. I will not permit
[49:30] her to go home. You'll have to have a
[49:32] place for her. And sometimes you can
[49:35] wait on a list for a year or two years
[49:37] to find a place in a senior citizen's
[49:39] home. It's one place that had a
[49:41] temporary home, a Baptist home over here
[49:43] in South Sur. And we had to take her
[49:46] there. And the room was just a tiny room
[49:52] maybe 12 ft across
[49:55] and a little al cove
[49:57] where there was a bed.
[50:00] And here is a cabinet and a sink and a
[50:03] bathroom there.
[50:06] And we had to put her in there and she's
[50:08] there today.
[50:10] And this is now this is your home.
[50:13] Well,
[50:15] that's tragic.
[50:17] That's tragic. And just go to the senior
[50:19] citizens homes. I don't know about you,
[50:23] I don't want to have to go there. I've
[50:25] told my family if I get that condition,
[50:27] push me over a cliff.
[50:30] I just don't want to go there. But we do
[50:33] want to go to our eternal home.
[50:36] &gt;&gt; All right. So, we'll be talking about
[50:38] that.
[50:40] All right. We'll read out of uh
[50:42] Revelation the 21st chapter.
[50:46] Uh reading from verse one.
[50:52] And I saw a new heaven and a new earth.
[50:55] For the first earth, the first heaven
[50:57] and the first earth were passed away,
[51:00] and there was no more sea. And I, John,
[51:03] saw the holy city, New Jerusalem, coming
[51:06] down from God, out of heaven, prepared
[51:09] as a bride, adorned for her husband. And
[51:12] I heard a great voice out of heaven,
[51:14] saying, "Behold, the tabernacle of God
[51:16] is with men." I'm glad that voice is
[51:19] there.
[51:20] &gt;&gt; And he will dwell with them, and they
[51:22] shall be his people. And God himself
[51:25] shall be with them and be their God. And
[51:29] God shall wipe away all tears. Notice
[51:32] please.
[51:33] Tears from their eyes. And there shall
[51:37] be no more death.
[51:39] Neither sorrow nor crying, neither shall
[51:44] there be any more pain, for the former
[51:48] things are passed away. Before we read
[51:51] the next scripture, I would like you
[51:52] just to notice, please,
[51:55] you're all going to go home sometime
[51:58] today, wherever your residence is. But I
[52:02] can guarantee you that residence has
[52:04] never had tears.
[52:07] That residence has never known death.
[52:11] That residence has never known sorrow or
[52:14] pain.
[52:16] And neither has it had any crying.
[52:20] It's it's this home.
[52:23] It's this home that has pain
[52:26] &gt;&gt; and sorrow and crying and tears and
[52:31] death. And it's this home that God's
[52:34] interested in.
[52:35] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[52:37] &gt;&gt; I'll read a second scripture, please, in
[52:39] 2 Corinthians
[52:41] 5
[52:44] and just a few verses there.
[52:51] Starting with verse one.
[52:54] For we know that if our earthly house of
[52:58] this tabernacle were dissolved,
[53:02] we have a building of God and house not
[53:04] made with hands, eternal in the heavens.
[53:09] For in this we grown earnestly, desiring
[53:11] to be clothed upon with our house which
[53:14] is from heaven.
[53:16] If so be that being clothed, we shall
[53:19] not be found naked.
[53:22] For we that are in this tabernacle do
[53:25] groan, being burdened, not for that
[53:28] which we would be unclothed, but clothed
[53:31] upon that mortality might be swallowed
[53:35] up in life.
[53:37] &gt;&gt; Amen. Heavenly Father, bless now this
[53:41] time
[53:43] as we study and read and speak in Jesus
[53:46] name. Amen. You may be seated.
[53:56] Apostle Paul says
[54:01] that we shall not be found if so being
[54:04] clothed, we shall not be found naked.
[54:08] And the message to the Leodysian church
[54:10] is that they were wretched and naked and
[54:14] blind. They they they didn't have
[54:16] anything no covering when they were
[54:19] presented when they came into the
[54:21] presence of God.
[54:25] I want you to notice in these uh in this
[54:27] last scripture reading which we had,
[54:31] Apostle Paul speaks of our body as
[54:36] our house
[54:39] of this tabernacle,
[54:42] a building of God.
[54:45] He says,
[54:48] "For we know that if our
[54:51] earthly house," I want you to think very
[54:53] personally now. You have a personal
[54:56] earthly house,
[54:58] but this earthly house is not
[55:02] not remaining,
[55:04] you know, it's not the status quo.
[55:07] As time goes on, you will find
[55:10] things change
[55:12] &gt;&gt; imperceptibly almost, but things change
[55:16] &gt;&gt; and you'll find that age will take its
[55:19] toll on you regardless of your health
[55:23] and beauty at this time and your
[55:26] strength of your youth. There's a lot of
[55:28] young people and young men and young
[55:30] ladies and even teenagers and younger go
[55:33] to the children's hospital and it's
[55:35] heart-wrenching.
[55:37] I've been there. We've had people that
[55:40] have had children who've been there.
[55:43] &gt;&gt; And it's heart-wrenching
[55:44] &gt;&gt; to see the little ones suffering. This
[55:48] world is a suffering place.
[55:50] &gt;&gt; And I can't I cannot help but long for a
[55:54] place where there is no sorrow or crying
[55:57] or pain because there's something in
[55:59] here calling out for that. Amen.
[56:03] &gt;&gt; And so Apostle Paul says if that earthly
[56:05] house if if we know that if our earthly
[56:09] house of this tabernacle and this is
[56:13] profoundly deep and I want you to follow
[56:16] me very very close and listen very
[56:18] attentively.
[56:20] Our earthly house of this tabernacle
[56:24] we're dissolved.
[56:27] We have a building
[56:29] &gt;&gt; not we will have. We have a building of
[56:32] God
[56:35] &gt;&gt; and house not made with hands
[56:38] &gt;&gt; eternal in the heavens.
[56:40] &gt;&gt; It's without beginning without end.
[56:44] &gt;&gt; And this for in this we grown earnestly
[56:50] to be clothed upon with our house which
[56:53] is from heaven.
[56:56] If we go back to the beginning and we
[56:58] have to go back to the beginning to get
[56:59] a real understanding. If you go back to
[57:01] the beginning and of the beginning of
[57:03] creation and you see a we speak about
[57:07] Eden. Soon as we see about Eden, we
[57:09] think of perfection. We think of
[57:11] something that is in perfect harmony.
[57:14] There's a scripture that says, "And the
[57:16] Lord God planted a garden eastward." No
[57:19] garden ever. You could go to butcher
[57:21] gardens or the beautiful gardens of the
[57:23] hanging gardens or whatever more. You'll
[57:25] never never imagine a garden as God
[57:28] planted a garden
[57:30] &gt;&gt; and he made it just right
[57:33] &gt;&gt; for his son Adam and his wife Eve. And
[57:36] the Bible tells us and there and there
[57:40] he put the man whom he had formed. I
[57:44] want to put the emphasis on that. The
[57:46] man that he had formed.
[57:49] There was a a harmonizing between the
[57:52] place. Eden wasn't the home. It was the
[57:55] place where the home was going to be.
[57:58] &gt;&gt; The home was what God had given Adam,
[58:02] the first man, Adam, which was a spirit
[58:04] man to live in.
[58:06] &gt;&gt; And he formed a body and gave him a
[58:08] body.
[58:11] God formed a constructed a body, a
[58:15] permanent house, a home
[58:18] for the first man, Adam, to dwell in.
[58:21] The scripture says, and for those of you
[58:23] that are are well acquainted with the
[58:25] message, as most of you are,
[58:28] uh we know that the first man, let us
[58:30] make man in our image
[58:34] and after our likeness.
[58:37] And then the scripture says, "And so God
[58:39] made man in his image." And the
[58:41] trinitarians get hung up on let us.
[58:44] &gt;&gt; And I go along with them and I say,
[58:46] "Okay, that's fine. Did God make one in
[58:49] his image?" Yes, we have to believe that
[58:51] because he said, "Let us make man in our
[58:53] image." I said, "When he was done, how
[58:55] many people did he have,
[58:58] &gt;&gt; didn't have three,
[59:00] &gt;&gt; didn't have two,
[59:01] &gt;&gt; he had one
[59:03] &gt;&gt; when he was done."
[59:05] &gt;&gt; And then he called their plural name
[59:07] Adam
[59:09] &gt;&gt; singular
[59:10] &gt;&gt; because even as God, he has masculine,
[59:13] feminine, he has got every relationship
[59:15] within him, but he's one God. Hear you,
[59:17] oh Israel. The Lord your God is one.
[59:20] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[59:22] &gt;&gt; You You've got the ability to be mother,
[59:24] to be father, to be an aunt, to be this,
[59:26] to be a husband, to be a wife, to be
[59:28] all. But you're one.
[59:30] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[59:31] &gt;&gt; And you love your children different
[59:32] from when you love your wife or your
[59:34] wife love your husband different than
[59:36] you love your children? How how can you
[59:37] have such a such a diverse capacity
[59:40] within you? Because you made like God
[59:43] made you that way. Amen.
[59:44] &gt;&gt; You can love your brothers and sisters,
[59:46] but you you have a special relationship
[59:48] with others. And so we won't get on to
[59:50] that. But then he placed this house
[59:54] &gt;&gt; in a beautiful garden.
[59:56] &gt;&gt; And the first man, Adam, was perfectly
[59:59] perfectly harmonized with his dwelling
[1:00:01] place.
[1:00:03] We speak of our future home
[1:00:06] as a home. And we often think of heaven
[1:00:09] as our home. But then the scripture says
[1:00:12] rather in the future home in that
[1:00:14] message future home there will be houses
[1:00:16] of pure gold there will be avenues and
[1:00:19] parks and gardens and the river of life
[1:00:21] coming trickling out of the throne
[1:00:24] running down through the chasms and oh
[1:00:27] over the terraces and the tree of life
[1:00:30] will be blooming in every yard and and
[1:00:33] bear its fruits 12 times a year. And we
[1:00:37] we think of that as a home. But I want
[1:00:39] to digress from that. I want to think
[1:00:41] about this house. And as uh the old song
[1:00:44] that was written by Stuart Hamlin when I
[1:00:47] was a lot younger, but I think you
[1:00:49] probably may have heard it. This old
[1:00:51] house.
[1:00:53] &gt;&gt; How many have you ever heard this old
[1:00:55] house? Oh, we've got some friends. For
[1:00:58] all of you that haven't heard about this
[1:00:59] old house. This old house once knew its
[1:01:02] children. This old house once knew its
[1:01:05] wife, his wife. This old house was home
[1:01:08] and comfort as they fought the storms of
[1:01:10] life. This old house once rang with
[1:01:14] laughter. This old house heard many
[1:01:17] shouts.
[1:01:18] Now he trembles in the darkness when the
[1:01:21] lightning walks about. Ain't going to
[1:01:24] need this house
[1:01:26] &gt;&gt; no longer. Ain't going to need this
[1:01:29] house no more.
[1:01:32] Ain't got time to fix the windows.
[1:01:35] Ain't got time to fix the floor.
[1:01:38] Ain't got time to oil the hinges.
[1:01:41] Nor to mend the window pane.
[1:01:44] Ain't going to need this house no
[1:01:45] longer. He's getting ready to meet the
[1:01:48] saints.
[1:01:52] &gt;&gt; Haven't got any time any longer. This
[1:01:53] old house, that's not the house that we
[1:01:56] want to stay in very long. Amen.
[1:02:00] &gt;&gt; You might be full of all vim and vigor
[1:02:02] and and ready to do things and that's
[1:02:06] just fine. Just let a little time go by
[1:02:10] and you'll be saying, "You know what? I
[1:02:12] agree with old brother Ed.
[1:02:17] I just can't do what I used to do."
[1:02:21] &gt;&gt; I used to I worked for a short time. I
[1:02:24] won't be long on this, but I worked for
[1:02:25] a short time with a old rancher and he
[1:02:28] was rugged. He was rugged and he had
[1:02:31] horses and cattle. He had so many
[1:02:33] horses, he didn't even know how many.
[1:02:35] And he used to tell about us. He'd go on
[1:02:37] into the night and we'd were trying to
[1:02:39] go to sleep and he'd be talking in the
[1:02:40] dark, you know, and we just had bunk
[1:02:42] beds and old ranch house sort of thing.
[1:02:44] And and he'd be talking about the old
[1:02:46] Bronx that he broke and everything else.
[1:02:48] He was all crippled and broken up,
[1:02:51] you know, he walked like this. He was
[1:02:53] probably in his late 70s and he'd say,
[1:02:56] "And I can still do it."
[1:03:00] So me and the other young fellow, you
[1:03:01] know, we'd get on and we'd say, "Well,
[1:03:03] here we got a couple Bronx out here. Why
[1:03:05] don't we do it? We'd like to see you
[1:03:07] break another one. Show us how." He
[1:03:09] never took us up on it. But inside, he
[1:03:12] was still youthful man. I can still do
[1:03:14] it.
[1:03:15] &gt;&gt; See, but this old house needed some oil
[1:03:19] in the hinges.
[1:03:20] &gt;&gt; Amen. Yes.
[1:03:23] I'm just setting the pace.
[1:03:28] The house as Paul speaks of it. And
[1:03:31] you'll have to allow me some time to lay
[1:03:34] some foundation here. The house as Paul
[1:03:37] speaks of it. And it's so wonderful. You
[1:03:38] know, God knew that the Bible was going
[1:03:40] to be written even in the Greek
[1:03:42] language, the New Testament. And the
[1:03:45] house is of course of the uh a a home, a
[1:03:50] dwelling, a household.
[1:03:52] But it's more than just a house. It's an
[1:03:55] inhabited house.
[1:03:57] &gt;&gt; This isn't just a shell. I'll just toss
[1:04:00] something out here for you. Jesus talked
[1:04:03] about the man and when the demon is cast
[1:04:06] out from him and the evil spirits are
[1:04:08] cast out from him and he goes wandering
[1:04:12] out in the in the wilderness in the
[1:04:14] desert places. And that demon spirit
[1:04:17] says, "I will return to my house."
[1:04:23] &gt;&gt; Because a spirit has to have something
[1:04:25] to manifest and to work and to be
[1:04:28] animated in.
[1:04:31] &gt;&gt; I will return to my house.
[1:04:34] So
[1:04:36] we have the Holy Spirit and that is why
[1:04:38] the Holy Spirit must inhabit the
[1:04:41] individual. Amen.
[1:04:44] &gt;&gt; That is how God and the only way God can
[1:04:46] express himself, the Holy Spirit must
[1:04:50] inhabit you.
[1:04:51] &gt;&gt; And if you're going to be a true son and
[1:04:53] daughter of God, you must be filled and
[1:04:55] baptized with the Holy Ghost.
[1:04:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:04:59] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:05:00] &gt;&gt; True.
[1:05:00] &gt;&gt; That's absolutely essential. And hol
[1:05:03] being baptized with the Holy Ghost is
[1:05:04] not a formality and it's not just a
[1:05:07] sensation. It's not that. It's a life.
[1:05:10] You become infused with the life.
[1:05:12] &gt;&gt; You have a human spirit. Where did you
[1:05:14] get it? It came into your body. When you
[1:05:16] took your first breath, as you entered
[1:05:18] out of your mother's womb, you took that
[1:05:20] breath of life in the human spirit. And
[1:05:24] whatever that whatever characteristics
[1:05:27] that spirit had, as that baby began to
[1:05:29] grow and mature, it began to uh manifest
[1:05:34] and demonstrate itself. And so, it's not
[1:05:36] only a house, but it's an inhabited
[1:05:38] house. And it speaks of the human body
[1:05:41] as an abode for the Holy Spirit.
[1:05:44] But he said, "Our earthly house of this
[1:05:47] tabernacle." And the tabernacle now is
[1:05:50] is very very rich. And I need you to
[1:05:53] hold with me on all of this. The
[1:05:55] tabernacle is a a like a tent. That's
[1:05:58] the first word. It's a tent.
[1:06:02] As the human body,
[1:06:04] this is just a tent.
[1:06:07] going to take it down someday.
[1:06:10] &gt;&gt; Or it's got to be changed to a permanent
[1:06:12] residence.
[1:06:14] &gt;&gt; You with me?
[1:06:15] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:06:17] &gt;&gt; In which the soul dwells as in a tent
[1:06:21] which is taken down at death.
[1:06:26] But that comes also it keeps coming down
[1:06:29] to more more foundation words in the
[1:06:34] Greek. It's also as a vessel.
[1:06:37] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:06:38] &gt;&gt; Speaks of Apostle Paul when he was
[1:06:41] strucken down on the road to Damascus
[1:06:43] and and they and and the the the prophet
[1:06:48] local prophet said that he's a God spoke
[1:06:51] to him said he's a chosen vessel
[1:06:53] &gt;&gt; unto me.
[1:06:55] &gt;&gt; Not just a tent but a chosen vessel unto
[1:06:58] me. And the scripture
[1:07:01] in Acts 9:15, it says, "Go thy way, for
[1:07:03] he's a chosen vessel unto me to bear my
[1:07:06] name before the Gentiles." And then Paul
[1:07:09] said in Timothy, "If a man therefore
[1:07:11] purge himself from these," speaking of
[1:07:14] the natural fleshly things, "he shall be
[1:07:16] a vessel unto honor, sanctified in meat
[1:07:20] for the master's use." And the vessel,
[1:07:23] this house, this tabernacle is is not
[1:07:27] just merely a tent. It's a tent which is
[1:07:30] a temporal place, but it's also a a
[1:07:33] vessel. And a vessel also making
[1:07:35] reference to the vessels that sail the
[1:07:38] seas. They have their tackle and their
[1:07:41] and their rigging and their ropes and
[1:07:44] and uh it it speaks of a man that has
[1:07:47] chosen qualities and so on. He's a
[1:07:50] vessel unto me and to my use. He's not
[1:07:53] only a tent. He's not only a dwelling
[1:07:55] place that I will dwell in him by the
[1:07:57] Holy Spirit, but he's going to be a
[1:07:59] useful vessel. And that's why perhaps we
[1:08:03] saying the anchor holds
[1:08:06] though the ship is battered.
[1:08:09] &gt;&gt; The anchor holds
[1:08:11] though the sails are torn.
[1:08:14] &gt;&gt; Is that right? I have fallen on my knees
[1:08:20] as I face the raging seas. The anchor
[1:08:24] holds
[1:08:26] in spite of the storm.
[1:08:28] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. That's this anchor.
[1:08:31] &gt;&gt; And not only the anchor, but that's this
[1:08:33] vessel.
[1:08:34] &gt;&gt; We've got some rigging. We've got some
[1:08:36] ropes. We've got some tackle.
[1:08:38] &gt;&gt; And we've got some sails to make our way
[1:08:41] through
[1:08:42] &gt;&gt; stormy seas and heavy seas.
[1:08:46] Because we are a tabernacle
[1:08:49] &gt;&gt; of God.
[1:08:51] &gt;&gt; We may be here on a temporal basis. We
[1:08:53] may be here not permanently. We're
[1:08:56] moving on our way. But there's one thing
[1:08:58] sure. We're heading for a a safe shore.
[1:09:05] &gt;&gt; And then it goes just a wee bit further.
[1:09:08] This tabernacle
[1:09:11] is a shadow. A third word of the Greek
[1:09:15] has to keep coming down. I wished I had
[1:09:17] it for you on the screen, but I didn't
[1:09:19] have s enough time. It's a shadow or a
[1:09:22] shade caused by the interception of
[1:09:27] light. A shadow or an image cast. And
[1:09:30] that's why the prophet, how many times
[1:09:32] you heard brother Brandham say, I hold
[1:09:35] my hand up,
[1:09:37] &gt;&gt; but the light casts a shadow. It's it's
[1:09:40] and the shadow is a negative,
[1:09:43] &gt;&gt; confirming that there's a positive,
[1:09:46] &gt;&gt; but the closer the positive gets to the
[1:09:48] negative, they merge into one.
[1:09:51] &gt;&gt; And then we learn that this is only a
[1:09:54] negative.
[1:09:56] If the house of this tabernacle,
[1:09:59] &gt;&gt; this shadow, this tent, if it gets
[1:10:02] closer and closer to the positive,
[1:10:05] hallelujah, they just merge into one.
[1:10:08] &gt;&gt; And that's why this body shall be
[1:10:11] changed, there will be a sweep that'll
[1:10:13] go across this body and the atoms of it
[1:10:16] will change.
[1:10:18] &gt;&gt; I've got some deep things to say it. And
[1:10:20] I say deep because there are things that
[1:10:22] I have never thought of before.
[1:10:27] And brother Mark, now you'll know,
[1:10:30] Brother Mark, Sister Rachel, we were
[1:10:32] having dinner the other night and they
[1:10:34] started to and he he started to say,
[1:10:36] "Well, I we even had the book there." He
[1:10:38] said something, you know, Brother
[1:10:39] Brandham said. So I said, "Sunday
[1:10:41] morning, just remember that I already
[1:10:43] had my notes printed before we before we
[1:10:47] sat together." That's good.
[1:10:51] &gt;&gt; This image,
[1:10:53] this shadow,
[1:10:56] this negative, this is the negative.
[1:10:59] &gt;&gt; Even though this negative we can put up
[1:11:00] and say, well, here's a I I I'm I'm
[1:11:04] creating a shadow using this as a as a
[1:11:07] positive and and the shadow is a
[1:11:09] negative. But this in truth is just a
[1:11:11] shadow.
[1:11:13] &gt;&gt; This is the negative. This is the
[1:11:14] negative. This is the passing. This is
[1:11:17] the tent.
[1:11:18] &gt;&gt; This is the shadow.
[1:11:21] &gt;&gt; And the real it's only this is only here
[1:11:24] because you have a real
[1:11:26] &gt;&gt; that's near you. And the prophet now you
[1:11:28] have to step into a prophetic ministry
[1:11:31] and he calls it a theophony.
[1:11:34] &gt;&gt; You have a real word body.
[1:11:37] &gt;&gt; The first Adam that was created a spirit
[1:11:40] man. You skipped by that. We all came by
[1:11:43] a natural sexual birth. But there's one
[1:11:46] that God made.
[1:11:48] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:11:51] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:11:53] &gt;&gt; And the prophet says, "But when we pass
[1:11:55] from here, we go immediately." One
[1:11:58] breath. You're one breath away. He said,
[1:12:01] "You have it beside you."
[1:12:03] &gt;&gt; Your doctor can't tell you that. The
[1:12:05] pharmacist can't. No one else can tell
[1:12:07] you that. Most preachers can't tell you
[1:12:09] that. But that's what speaks in the
[1:12:11] message. A prophet message tells you you
[1:12:14] have you have it
[1:12:16] &gt;&gt; and it happens to be the reality
[1:12:19] &gt;&gt; and it's not going to get older.
[1:12:22] &gt;&gt; It's not going to get gray hair. It's
[1:12:23] not going to lose its hair. It's not
[1:12:25] going to get stooped shoulders. It's not
[1:12:27] going to have short breath. It's
[1:12:29] eternal. And you have it.
[1:12:31] [Music]
[1:12:34] &gt;&gt; Every son and daughter of God
[1:12:37] has it.
[1:12:39] Hallelujah.
[1:12:40] &gt;&gt; So the first man, Adam, let me just now
[1:12:43] go back a wee bit, was a spirit man.
[1:12:49] He was in the very image of God.
[1:12:54] Let us make man in our image and after
[1:12:56] our likeness. And the Bible says, "And
[1:12:58] so God made man in his image."
[1:13:02] And brother Brandham said as he walked
[1:13:04] through the garden of Eden first first
[1:13:08] as a theophony
[1:13:11] like the Holy Spirit is here now walking
[1:13:14] in here.
[1:13:16] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:13:19] &gt;&gt; Now it is deep. It is deep.
[1:13:23] &gt;&gt; You can't think and figure out and
[1:13:26] calculate how this Holy Spirit is
[1:13:28] walking through here.
[1:13:30] &gt;&gt; Amen. But at this very moment, the Holy
[1:13:33] Spirit is saying one thing to this
[1:13:35] person here, another thing to this man,
[1:13:37] another thing to this girl and this
[1:13:39] woman over here, another thing to
[1:13:41] someone else. And the same Holy Spirit,
[1:13:45] and brother Brandham says it more than
[1:13:47] one place that that Adam in his first
[1:13:49] state was given control of all of
[1:13:52] creation and the animals and so on.
[1:13:53] That's why he could even name them. He
[1:13:55] said, and he had a body. It was like
[1:13:58] he's like the Holy Spirit that guides
[1:14:01] the church now.
[1:14:03] &gt;&gt; Like the Holy Spirit directs the church
[1:14:06] now.
[1:14:08] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:14:10] &gt;&gt; We are animal.
[1:14:13] &gt;&gt; I learned that in school even back then
[1:14:16] that we're mammal. I'm glad we got the
[1:14:19] Holy Ghost to guide these animals too.
[1:14:24] Amen.
[1:14:25] &gt;&gt; I know we're very refined and very
[1:14:27] dignified and we've learned and we're
[1:14:29] cultured and all the things, but it's
[1:14:31] just amazing what these animals can do.
[1:14:34] &gt;&gt; How they can go and kill one another for
[1:14:36] no reason at all
[1:14:38] &gt;&gt; and murder and the world is full of it
[1:14:40] and conflicts are everywhere and the
[1:14:43] earth is is is being saturated with the
[1:14:45] blood. Why? Because man outside of God
[1:14:48] is merely an animal.
[1:14:53] And as I've I have often said, don't
[1:14:55] attribute this to a pig or a dog.
[1:15:00] &gt;&gt; They live with much higher standard
[1:15:03] &gt;&gt; than many humans.
[1:15:06] &gt;&gt; Humans will give themselves over to such
[1:15:08] a degraded condition. You ought to see
[1:15:13] &gt;&gt; Well, you have seen it.
[1:15:14] &gt;&gt; You know what I'm talking about. That's
[1:15:16] why you're quiet.
[1:15:17] &gt;&gt; That's exactly the case. Without God,
[1:15:20] friends, where would you and I be?
[1:15:23] &gt;&gt; God for God forbid we even have to go
[1:15:26] there.
[1:15:27] &gt;&gt; But without God,
[1:15:28] &gt;&gt; so I'm glad for this Holy Spirit
[1:15:31] &gt;&gt; that is guiding the church today.
[1:15:35] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:15:36] &gt;&gt; And that's what Adam was like in his
[1:15:38] first creation.
[1:15:42] And then there was no one to till the
[1:15:44] soil. And so God formed
[1:15:48] a body and took from him from that
[1:15:52] original creation took from him a
[1:15:55] helpmate which was Eve his wife which
[1:15:59] had a womb for his seed. But the serpent
[1:16:02] got there first
[1:16:04] &gt;&gt; and brought forth a liar and a murderer
[1:16:09] &gt;&gt; called Cain.
[1:16:11] &gt;&gt; You can never attribute that to God.
[1:16:14] &gt;&gt; Come on. And that is why God said, "I'll
[1:16:17] put enmity between you and the woman and
[1:16:19] between your seed, your seed, the
[1:16:21] serpent's seed." How scholars can miss
[1:16:24] that is more than I know.
[1:16:26] &gt;&gt; Between your seed and the seed of the
[1:16:29] woman, and the woman has no seed, and it
[1:16:32] takes a prophet with a seventh grade
[1:16:33] education because it didn't come from
[1:16:35] his education. It came from God. That
[1:16:38] kind of wisdom came from God.
[1:16:41] &gt;&gt; Do you agree with that?
[1:16:43] &gt;&gt; True.
[1:16:45] Amen.
[1:16:45] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:16:47] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:16:49] &gt;&gt; And that seed,
[1:16:51] your seed will bruise his heel, but he
[1:16:54] will bruise your head.
[1:16:56] &gt;&gt; And I'm glad we have that more than just
[1:16:59] a a knowledge, more than just an
[1:17:00] understanding.
[1:17:03] Friends, there's no there's not a
[1:17:06] purpose in the world. There isn't a
[1:17:07] reason in the world for a person to give
[1:17:10] themselves uh towards a kingdom, Satan's
[1:17:13] kingdom, because the leader of that
[1:17:15] kingdom has already been sentenced and
[1:17:18] doomed.
[1:17:19] &gt;&gt; He has a crushed head.
[1:17:21] &gt;&gt; Say, "Well, I'm following a leader. He's
[1:17:23] got a crushed head.
[1:17:25] &gt;&gt; Don't give yourself there. Don't go
[1:17:27] there.
[1:17:28] &gt;&gt; Let's go to a leader that is a king,
[1:17:31] &gt;&gt; the eternal king. Amen.
[1:17:33] &gt;&gt; Let's go to one who's righteous,
[1:17:35] &gt;&gt; who's just.
[1:17:36] &gt;&gt; He will never never deny a righteous
[1:17:39] person.
[1:17:40] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:17:43] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:17:44] &gt;&gt; In the very image of God.
[1:17:47] &gt;&gt; And then there was no man to till the
[1:17:50] soil. So in Genesis 2, then a body is
[1:17:54] formed.
[1:17:55] I know you all know this very well, but
[1:17:57] follow and stay with me. And he forms.
[1:18:00] We do not know how that forming took
[1:18:02] place, but we know that God created all
[1:18:05] things by his word. I'm going to drop
[1:18:08] something in. You'll have to think about
[1:18:09] it and maybe swim for a while.
[1:18:16] So now came forth man.
[1:18:24] Adam was formed out of the dust of the
[1:18:26] earth.
[1:18:29] and his wife was taken from him
[1:18:34] and then the serpent seed was introduced
[1:18:37] and God had to curse the earth.
[1:18:40] &gt;&gt; That's where it all started.
[1:18:43] Every prison,
[1:18:45] every incarcerated person,
[1:18:49] every hospital bed,
[1:18:52] every mortuary and every gravestone
[1:18:55] is represented there.
[1:18:58] And God cursed the serpent.
[1:19:03] He did not curse the woman or the man.
[1:19:08] But there were aspects of their life.
[1:19:12] And the woman because she had received
[1:19:14] that seed. You will conceive
[1:19:18] in sorrow and bring forth children in
[1:19:22] pain and you will multiply and you'll
[1:19:25] bring forth. And that's what it all had
[1:19:28] to do. And with the man, he cursed the
[1:19:30] earth because the man had to be the
[1:19:32] provider. And the earth is cursed and
[1:19:36] it'll bring forth thorns and thistles
[1:19:39] and stickers
[1:19:41] and all kinds of things. And now the
[1:19:44] earth because of this cursed
[1:19:46] environment.
[1:19:47] And then now the woman is carrying not
[1:19:51] one seed but two seeds.
[1:19:55] And the bodies of those boys are coming
[1:19:58] from a cursed earth,
[1:20:01] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:20:02] &gt;&gt; And they come and they immediately
[1:20:07] begin to once you're born, they begin to
[1:20:10] die. They may live for hundreds of
[1:20:12] years, but their bodies, as your bodies,
[1:20:17] hello,
[1:20:18] &gt;&gt; your physical bodies have come from a
[1:20:22] cursed earth. You're made of that.
[1:20:26] &gt;&gt; But now God
[1:20:28] began to speak out of the cursed earth.
[1:20:34] his words
[1:20:36] &gt;&gt; from his his ordained mouthpieces,
[1:20:41] &gt;&gt; sons and daughters of God,
[1:20:43] &gt;&gt; who were living in a who who their
[1:20:46] physical being was of the cursed earth
[1:20:49] and they came by a a sexual birth which
[1:20:52] was not the not the way that God had
[1:20:55] ordained it. It was a secondary way.
[1:20:58] &gt;&gt; And they begin to speak of a coming of
[1:21:01] redemption. Amen.
[1:21:04] &gt;&gt; Out of the position in being in a cursed
[1:21:08] body,
[1:21:09] &gt;&gt; a body of cursed material, shall I say,
[1:21:12] &gt;&gt; a body that was, are you with me?
[1:21:14] &gt;&gt; But out of their mouth, they begin to
[1:21:17] confess
[1:21:18] &gt;&gt; that which was a reality.
[1:21:21] &gt;&gt; And things they didn't understand. And
[1:21:24] the scripture says that the prophets
[1:21:26] they searched what manner and what
[1:21:28] manner of time it was that the of the
[1:21:32] sufferings of Christ and the glory which
[1:21:34] should follow because they were seeing
[1:21:37] somehow aspects and different facets of
[1:21:41] redemption. And while they were in a
[1:21:43] cursed earth, a cursed position not
[1:21:46] unlike us today because there was
[1:21:49] something in them that was saying there
[1:21:52] is another home.
[1:21:53] [Music]
[1:21:54] There is another place because they
[1:21:57] begin to see that there was jealousy and
[1:22:01] hatred and pride and men became enemies
[1:22:05] and they fought one with another,
[1:22:07] brother against brother, family against
[1:22:10] family and there was something in them
[1:22:12] saying surely this is not the way it's
[1:22:14] supposed to be.
[1:22:17] &gt;&gt; Something in them was saying there's got
[1:22:19] to be something different than this.
[1:22:22] Amen.
[1:22:23] &gt;&gt; There's something in you and I that are
[1:22:25] here today and we see all the religious
[1:22:27] world and all the uh bickering and all
[1:22:31] of the strife and the world and the
[1:22:33] politics and the nations and everything
[1:22:35] else and there's something in us that
[1:22:37] says surely this isn't the way it is.
[1:22:44] &gt;&gt; Go out into your street.
[1:22:47] Walk down your street. Go down Robson
[1:22:49] Street. go down Davy Street.
[1:22:53] &gt;&gt; We had brothers in the police that said
[1:22:56] they didn't even want to get out out of
[1:22:58] their car. These are men. These are
[1:23:00] policemen with guns and weapons and
[1:23:03] spray and handcuffs and everything else.
[1:23:05] They don't want to get out in the
[1:23:06] streets of Vancouver.
[1:23:09] &gt;&gt; And every city is the same.
[1:23:11] &gt;&gt; And the prophet of God declares the
[1:23:13] absolute truth. Every every political
[1:23:16] system is of the devil. Amen.
[1:23:19] &gt;&gt; And it's going that direction.
[1:23:21] &gt;&gt; And you might as well say amen to it
[1:23:23] &gt;&gt; because that's already a voice in the
[1:23:25] heavens.
[1:23:26] &gt;&gt; It's already been said and that's the
[1:23:29] way it is.
[1:23:31] &gt;&gt; And this is a cursed earth
[1:23:33] &gt;&gt; and God's going to renovate it.
[1:23:36] &gt;&gt; God's going to destroy it, but keep the
[1:23:38] framework.
[1:23:39] &gt;&gt; He's going to bring a reign of
[1:23:40] righteousness and holiness.
[1:23:47] And so these men spake of their own
[1:23:51] &gt;&gt; redemption.
[1:23:54] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:23:55] &gt;&gt; Stay with me now.
[1:23:57] &gt;&gt; They actually declared their own
[1:24:00] resurrection
[1:24:07] &gt;&gt; out of a cursed
[1:24:10] body of earth. The earth was cursed
[1:24:15] and their their mothers ate the food and
[1:24:19] your mother ate food and your body is
[1:24:23] decrepit and shall go back to dust
[1:24:25] again.
[1:24:27] &gt;&gt; But for those redeemed,
[1:24:30] &gt;&gt; those who believe.
[1:24:32] &gt;&gt; And that's the difference, friends.
[1:24:33] You're either a believer or an
[1:24:35] unbeliever.
[1:24:37] For those that believe.
[1:24:39] &gt;&gt; And for those that believe, they don't
[1:24:41] have to be convinced every day. They
[1:24:42] don't have to be propped up every day.
[1:24:44] They simply believe it.
[1:24:47] &gt;&gt; They believe it in spite of everything
[1:24:49] they see. They believe it in spite of
[1:24:51] everything that happens to them. We just
[1:24:54] believe it.
[1:24:56] &gt;&gt; And those apostles or rather the seers
[1:24:59] and prophets and sages of they just
[1:25:01] believed it. And the Bible says
[1:25:06] of Abraham, Abram, and God appeared to
[1:25:10] Abram and told him, "Leave your country.
[1:25:14] Leave your kindred.
[1:25:17] &gt;&gt; Those that's what he could see. That's
[1:25:19] what he was attached to. That's what he
[1:25:21] was emotionally attached to.
[1:25:24] &gt;&gt; Leave this
[1:25:25] &gt;&gt; and go to a land that I will show you."
[1:25:29] And that's exactly where we are today as
[1:25:31] Abraham's children. We've had to leave.
[1:25:33] We've had to make decisive decisions,
[1:25:36] conscious decisions. I'm done with the
[1:25:38] world. I'm done with my old life. I'm
[1:25:40] done with my friends. I'm done with
[1:25:42] that. I separate myself and I set my
[1:25:45] face towards the country.
[1:25:48] Where is it? I'm not exactly sure,
[1:25:52] &gt;&gt; but it's a land he said he will show me.
[1:25:56] And there's something in here that says
[1:25:58] there that land is a reality.
[1:26:01] [Music]
[1:26:04] &gt;&gt; And I'm on my way.
[1:26:07] &gt;&gt; Not knowing where we go.
[1:26:10] &gt;&gt; Not knowing what the future holds, but
[1:26:12] I'm on my way.
[1:26:13] &gt;&gt; It's going to be up to whoever called
[1:26:15] me.
[1:26:16] &gt;&gt; And I believe in the God that called me.
[1:26:19] &gt;&gt; I believe in the God of this message. I
[1:26:22] believe in the God of the prophet that
[1:26:24] spoke future home.
[1:26:27] [Music]
[1:26:29] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:26:34] &gt;&gt; So he gave
[1:26:36] this body as a dwelling place. And here
[1:26:37] we are today. I'm getting a little ahead
[1:26:39] of myself, but I must just follow along.
[1:26:42] Here you are in this state, in this
[1:26:45] condition. And remember the cursed earth
[1:26:47] brought brought forth stickers,
[1:26:51] thorns and thistles. And that's why the
[1:26:53] prophet says we will always have
[1:26:56] &gt;&gt; that sticky nature
[1:26:58] &gt;&gt; because we've got this. He says in in
[1:27:01] the future home, he says our your soul
[1:27:04] is redeemed now
[1:27:06] &gt;&gt; and your body will be redeemed with the
[1:27:09] earth.
[1:27:10] &gt;&gt; God is going to renovate this earth.
[1:27:12] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:27:14] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. Amen.
[1:27:16] &gt;&gt; And if you don't go by way of death, he
[1:27:18] said death will take you there.
[1:27:20] &gt;&gt; But if you don't go by way of death, you
[1:27:22] will have to be changed.
[1:27:25] &gt;&gt; And that change is equal to what happens
[1:27:27] at death.
[1:27:29] &gt;&gt; When you're changed, you'll arrive in
[1:27:31] another body in a moment, in a twinkling
[1:27:34] of an eye.
[1:27:36] &gt;&gt; Oh, what an ultimate victory.
[1:27:38] &gt;&gt; This is what Jesus suffered for. This is
[1:27:40] why he died.
[1:27:45] And so
[1:27:48] you have to ponder this a wee bit. And
[1:27:50] so here were these men, men like you and
[1:27:54] I.
[1:27:56] Men who had infirmities and men who had
[1:28:00] weaknesses.
[1:28:04] Moses
[1:28:06] &gt;&gt; type of Christ.
[1:28:09] &gt;&gt; Samuel
[1:28:10] type of Christ. Isaac. Abraham. Isaac,
[1:28:13] Jacob,
[1:28:14] &gt;&gt; Joseph,
[1:28:17] &gt;&gt; all a perfect type of Christ.
[1:28:18] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:28:19] &gt;&gt; Not not all a perfect type, but a type
[1:28:21] of Christ. Christ who was perfect.
[1:28:23] Brother Brandham says Joseph was
[1:28:25] perfection, but he did have a little
[1:28:26] scratch.
[1:28:30] &gt;&gt; Nobody was without a scratch.
[1:28:33] &gt;&gt; And some of us have more
[1:28:35] &gt;&gt; than others.
[1:28:37] &gt;&gt; But that's fine.
[1:28:38] &gt;&gt; It'll be done away with. Well, should I
[1:28:41] just give up, brother Bisc? No, don't
[1:28:43] give up. Let that which is real in your
[1:28:45] soul rise up and take control over the
[1:28:48] body.
[1:28:50] Let that which is in your soul take
[1:28:51] control of your emotions
[1:28:53] &gt;&gt; and take control of the body, the
[1:28:56] physical being
[1:28:57] &gt;&gt; and we go where we ought to go and do
[1:29:00] not go where we should not go because
[1:29:03] the Holy Spirit from within is guiding
[1:29:05] us,
[1:29:06] &gt;&gt; guiding our speaking,
[1:29:09] &gt;&gt; guiding our confession.
[1:29:11] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:29:12] &gt;&gt; But yet it'll still have a sticky nature
[1:29:14] because it came of a cursed earth.
[1:29:17] Amen.
[1:29:18] &gt;&gt; And so now comes the most unique
[1:29:22] being that ever walked.
[1:29:28] And a virgin, Mary said to the angel,
[1:29:32] "Be it unto me according to your word."
[1:29:37] &gt;&gt; And the Bible says details, now you've
[1:29:41] heard me say it before, but I have to
[1:29:42] say it in this context. It details all
[1:29:46] the details of the birth of Christ. And
[1:29:49] then the Bible says in in Matthew the 2
[1:29:53] chapter, all this was done,
[1:29:57] every detail of the birth of Christ, all
[1:30:00] of this was done that it might be
[1:30:04] fulfilled which was spoken of uh spoken
[1:30:08] of the Lord by the prophets. So the
[1:30:12] prophets literally spoke.
[1:30:16] &gt;&gt; You with me?
[1:30:17] &gt;&gt; They literally spoke the body of Jesus
[1:30:21] Christ into existence.
[1:30:25] &gt;&gt; Now you have to think about that.
[1:30:27] &gt;&gt; It was God's word.
[1:30:30] &gt;&gt; It's not the prophet's word. It's God's
[1:30:32] word.
[1:30:33] &gt;&gt; And God called forth the second Adam out
[1:30:37] of the earth.
[1:30:39] Amen.
[1:30:45] &gt;&gt; And he took a body.
[1:30:47] &gt;&gt; Mary
[1:30:48] &gt;&gt; ate grain and wheat and things that grew
[1:30:52] out of the soil
[1:30:55] and issued into the world.
[1:30:59] &gt;&gt; A man child. The Bible says a man child.
[1:31:05] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:31:06] &gt;&gt; But in him was God.
[1:31:10] So part of that conception there was the
[1:31:13] flesh part which was man. He would be
[1:31:17] hungry as you get hungry. He would sweat
[1:31:20] when you got hot. He had every He was
[1:31:24] tempted in all points as we are.
[1:31:29] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:31:30] &gt;&gt; Listen to me young man. Jesus was your
[1:31:33] age.
[1:31:36] &gt;&gt; He knows exactly. And the same devil
[1:31:39] that speaks to you spoke to him.
[1:31:45] &gt;&gt; He was your age.
[1:31:48] &gt;&gt; He knows everything about it.
[1:31:52] &gt;&gt; And when he came
[1:31:54] to his manhood
[1:31:57] and 30 years old, he begins a ministry
[1:32:02] and he begins to take
[1:32:04] this body.
[1:32:06] But the but the the the spirit part of
[1:32:09] him was God.
[1:32:12] &gt;&gt; So he was man very man and he was God
[1:32:15] very God.
[1:32:17] &gt;&gt; And he took
[1:32:19] &gt;&gt; that's why we can identify him. He took
[1:32:22] that cursed body to Calvary.
[1:32:26] &gt;&gt; He took and brought the earth body into
[1:32:29] full subjection
[1:32:32] &gt;&gt; to show to us it can be done. and he
[1:32:35] took it to Calvary.
[1:32:39] &gt;&gt; You still want me to keep on preaching?
[1:32:43] &gt;&gt; And he aged like you age.
[1:32:46] &gt;&gt; In fact, is he aged prematurely
[1:32:49] &gt;&gt; because when he was 30, he looked like
[1:32:51] he was 50.
[1:32:54] &gt;&gt; And the Pharisees said, "You're not 50."
[1:32:57] And you say that you saw Abraham before
[1:33:00] Abraham was. I am. Yeah.
[1:33:03] &gt;&gt; That was a spirit part.
[1:33:05] &gt;&gt; He was God.
[1:33:07] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. He could speak to the wind
[1:33:09] and speak to the waves and he could
[1:33:11] speak to the tree. Let no fruit be born
[1:33:14] on you.
[1:33:16] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:33:18] &gt;&gt; Demonstrating and showing what a son of
[1:33:20] God a restored position. But he took
[1:33:23] that body, brought the earth into
[1:33:25] absolute subjection to the spirit of God
[1:33:29] that was in him. God was in Christ.
[1:33:32] reconciling the world to himself. Listen
[1:33:34] friends, he didn't do it for himself. He
[1:33:36] did it for you sitting here today.
[1:33:41] &gt;&gt; And he takes it to Calvary
[1:33:45] and he's able to say,
[1:33:48] "No man,
[1:33:50] &gt;&gt; takes my life from me. I lay it down and
[1:33:52] I will take it up again."
[1:33:57] &gt;&gt; That body had to listen to him.
[1:34:01] and he took it to the tomb. And out from
[1:34:04] the tomb came a a a person, a being that
[1:34:09] could eat fish, broil fish and honey,
[1:34:13] and pass through a wall, a physical
[1:34:15] wall.
[1:34:18] It was the same Christ
[1:34:20] &gt;&gt; in another form
[1:34:24] &gt;&gt; showing to us that there is another form
[1:34:27] &gt;&gt; and it's a real form
[1:34:29] &gt;&gt; and you can take it and handle it and
[1:34:31] shake hands. Feel me, touch melle.
[1:34:34] &gt;&gt; The spirit hath not flesh and bones such
[1:34:37] as I have. Do you see the reality of it,
[1:34:40] friends?
[1:34:45] &gt;&gt; And now here we are. He's demonstrating
[1:34:47] all through the scriptures that these
[1:34:50] bodies, they can have stickers, they can
[1:34:53] have weaknesses, they can have
[1:34:54] frailties. And your enemy, he has only
[1:34:57] one thing in mind. Condemn you for your
[1:35:00] weaknesses.
[1:35:01] &gt;&gt; And God only has one thing in mind. And
[1:35:03] that is deny that liar.
[1:35:07] &gt;&gt; Deny him. He has no good intent for you.
[1:35:11] He has no good plan for you. deny the
[1:35:15] unbeliever and believe.
[1:35:18] &gt;&gt; Believe the promise.
[1:35:23] &gt;&gt; And so now we were speaking that there's
[1:35:26] a great voice in heaven and the voice of
[1:35:28] the uh the voice of the prophets, the
[1:35:32] voice of the righteous, the voice of the
[1:35:35] apostles, the voice of the messengers,
[1:35:38] and the voice of the messenger of this
[1:35:40] time. But I want to add another voice.
[1:35:44] to the heavens. Listen to me. I'm not
[1:35:46] speaking some
[1:35:49] mystical stuff.
[1:35:52] I want you to add your voice
[1:35:55] &gt;&gt; to the heavens.
[1:35:58] &gt;&gt; And let's say here and let's agree here
[1:36:00] today. There's a great voice in the
[1:36:01] heavens.
[1:36:03] &gt;&gt; And at at at at that day when I stand
[1:36:05] before him, I shall hear my voice in
[1:36:08] full agreement with his voice.
[1:36:11] I will hear my voice saying what my
[1:36:14] prophet said. I will hear my voice
[1:36:17] declaring by confession exactly what he
[1:36:20] said.
[1:36:23] &gt;&gt; You think these are little phrases? You
[1:36:25] know what he says? Say
[1:36:28] &gt;&gt; what the tape says.
[1:36:31] &gt;&gt; Say it.
[1:36:32] &gt;&gt; Why? Because you'll hear it again.
[1:36:34] [Music]
[1:36:36] Hallelujah.
[1:36:38] &gt;&gt; You don't want to stand up there and
[1:36:40] say, "Well, I don't know about that. I
[1:36:42] think that's just what the preacher
[1:36:43] thinks." You'll hear it.
[1:36:49] &gt;&gt; Oh, I think you know all those
[1:36:50] unbelievers that all those criti
[1:36:53] criticizers that stood there, they'll
[1:36:55] stand there while Brother Brandham
[1:36:57] stands there.
[1:37:00] &gt;&gt; When that pillar of fire was staying
[1:37:02] with him all the time, and the angel of
[1:37:05] the Lord who is none other than the Lord
[1:37:07] Jesus Christ himself on the platform.
[1:37:10] Can you imagine being in that presence
[1:37:12] and those men hearing their voices
[1:37:14] saying I think that's his own idea.
[1:37:17] &gt;&gt; Good.
[1:37:18] &gt;&gt; He ought to just stay with the gift and
[1:37:21] let leave the teaching up to us.
[1:37:23] &gt;&gt; Can you imagine hearing that?
[1:37:25] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:37:26] &gt;&gt; And that's what they will hear. You
[1:37:28] think that's my imagination? That's what
[1:37:30] the scripture teaches us.
[1:37:33] Amen.
[1:37:34] &gt;&gt; Why am I preaching with such fervor?
[1:37:36] Because these things need to be made
[1:37:37] known. In this season,
[1:37:40] &gt;&gt; say what he said.
[1:37:46] &gt;&gt; You may not understand it any more than
[1:37:48] Abraham knew where he was going. He
[1:37:50] didn't know where he was going. That's
[1:37:51] irrelevant. He could say, "I heard from
[1:37:54] God and this is what he told me to do
[1:37:57] and I'm on my way.
[1:38:01] And that's all you need to say.
[1:38:03] &gt;&gt; Do you understand it? No, I don't fully
[1:38:05] understand it. I don't understand
[1:38:07] everything about this way, but I have a
[1:38:09] calling within me. And I'm going to come
[1:38:11] to that now.
[1:38:14] [Music]
[1:38:15] &gt;&gt; And add your voice
[1:38:18] &gt;&gt; is what I'm saying to you. In the name
[1:38:19] of Jesus Christ, add your voice.
[1:38:22] &gt;&gt; Don't add your doubts.
[1:38:25] &gt;&gt; Don't add your criticism.
[1:38:27] &gt;&gt; Don't add your evil things. at your
[1:38:30] voice that someday I want to hear this
[1:38:32] again. Amen.
[1:38:35] &gt;&gt; I've given it a lot of thought, friend,
[1:38:37] when I was ready to say something
[1:38:41] &gt;&gt; and I asked myself, do I want to hear
[1:38:43] this again?
[1:38:46] &gt;&gt; And I agree with my own self, I don't
[1:38:49] want to hear it again, so I don't say
[1:38:51] it.
[1:38:53] [Music]
[1:38:55] &gt;&gt; You aren't going to hear it again
[1:38:57] &gt;&gt; unless you say, "Lord, forgive me. I'm
[1:38:59] sorry.
[1:39:00] &gt;&gt; I'm sorry I said that. Forgive me. and
[1:39:03] let the blood
[1:39:05] &gt;&gt; wash it away.
[1:39:07] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:39:09] &gt;&gt; How How many are thankful for the blood
[1:39:10] of Jesus Christ? Of course we are.
[1:39:14] &gt;&gt; Oh my.
[1:39:17] &gt;&gt; Even then, if you didn't raise your
[1:39:19] hand, you should raise it now cuz you'll
[1:39:20] see that act again. Also, if you didn't
[1:39:23] raise it, raise it now.
[1:39:27] [Music]
[1:39:40] And that's why he was called the
[1:39:42] beginning,
[1:39:45] the beginning of the creation of God.
[1:39:50] In the message, he must be born again.
[1:39:51] He says, "Then came in sin. Then in came
[1:39:54] sin, and sin marred the picture." This
[1:39:57] just kind of gives a review of it. But
[1:39:59] sin can't stop the purpose of God.
[1:40:04] I
[1:40:04] &gt;&gt; if these things mean something to you,
[1:40:07] often when I'm sitting in the seat
[1:40:09] behind in a minister's ministering and I
[1:40:11] hear him saying something and quoting
[1:40:13] the prophet of God, quoting the
[1:40:16] scripture, I will say it with him
[1:40:17] because I want my own soul
[1:40:20] &gt;&gt; to emphasize that.
[1:40:22] &gt;&gt; And you should say with me, but sin
[1:40:25] can't stop the purpose of God.
[1:40:27] &gt;&gt; Let's say it together. But sin can't
[1:40:30] stop the purpose of God.
[1:40:33] &gt;&gt; And now we can say hallelujah.
[1:40:35] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:40:36] &gt;&gt; You have an enemy. He wants to stop it.
[1:40:39] &gt;&gt; He wants to hinder you.
[1:40:40] &gt;&gt; He wants to make your life miserable.
[1:40:43] But sin can't stop the purpose of God.
[1:40:46] Believe that
[1:40:47] [Music]
[1:40:53] &gt;&gt; God will not be defeated.
[1:40:56] &gt;&gt; Say that with me. God will not be
[1:40:59] defeated. And the people said, "Praise
[1:41:01] God."
[1:41:02] &gt;&gt; Praise God.
[1:41:02] &gt;&gt; God will not be defeated.
[1:41:06] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:41:08] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:41:10] &gt;&gt; We may miss the mark or fail sometime
[1:41:12] along the way, but God will not be
[1:41:14] defeated. And we're God's children.
[1:41:18] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Oh yeah.
[1:41:21] &gt;&gt; He says, "Because sin came in, the woman
[1:41:24] brought forth man, which was secondary,
[1:41:27] a perverted way."
[1:41:28] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:41:29] &gt;&gt; A perverted way. God never created him
[1:41:32] out of the dust of the earth with his
[1:41:34] own hands. But woman had brought him
[1:41:37] through sex.
[1:41:40] &gt;&gt; Same way we came.
[1:41:42] &gt;&gt; It was a secondary way. And that's why
[1:41:45] we have the struggles we have. But God's
[1:41:48] not going to leave you in this state.
[1:41:51] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. God's children. Can you just
[1:41:53] imagine? Try to turn your mind loose and
[1:41:57] break the barriers down and think of a
[1:41:59] place in the city where the lamb is the
[1:42:02] light
[1:42:03] &gt;&gt; in the city.
[1:42:05] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:42:07] &gt;&gt; Where divine light.
[1:42:11] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen.
[1:42:14] &gt;&gt; He says, "Then what happened
[1:42:16] where we where we make our bodies from
[1:42:20] the dust of the earth, the calcium," he
[1:42:23] says, "the lumber,
[1:42:25] that pot ash that God had laying out is
[1:42:29] still being used. One day, the last bit
[1:42:32] of it will be used up."
[1:42:33] &gt;&gt; And that's right, the lumber pile will
[1:42:36] go down, but God still makes man from
[1:42:39] the dust of the earth. Hallelujah.
[1:42:41] &gt;&gt; And you come on this earth without
[1:42:43] having any reason, any way you uh no way
[1:42:47] at all you had of bringing yourself
[1:42:49] here. God brought you here.
[1:42:53] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:42:54] &gt;&gt; You are not an accidental birth.
[1:42:57] &gt;&gt; God brought you here.
[1:42:58] &gt;&gt; And that's why he caused his message,
[1:43:01] his message by the Holy Spirit to come
[1:43:03] your way. You're sitting here this
[1:43:05] morning because God wants you here.
[1:43:09] [Music]
[1:43:11] Thank you, Lord.
[1:43:13] &gt;&gt; You may not have even been able to make
[1:43:15] certain meetings to the past, but God
[1:43:17] has you here because he wants you to
[1:43:19] hear this service.
[1:43:22] [Music]
[1:43:23] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:43:26] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:43:26] &gt;&gt; Why doesn't the believing congregation
[1:43:28] say, "Amen."
[1:43:29] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:43:33] &gt;&gt; That means so be it.
[1:43:36] But by the sexual birth, we skipped
[1:43:38] around.
[1:43:40] &gt;&gt; We skipped around the other one.
[1:43:43] &gt;&gt; That original man, the one God had in
[1:43:46] his mind. In fact, is when he had in his
[1:43:48] mind said, "Let us make man." I don't
[1:43:51] think it's speaking of one man.
[1:43:54] &gt;&gt; Let us make man
[1:43:56] &gt;&gt; in our image. God had in his mind his
[1:43:59] family. That's I can tell you that
[1:44:02] because all through the scriptures, he
[1:44:04] calls out for his family.
[1:44:06] &gt;&gt; He goes out to Abraham and I'm going to
[1:44:08] give you a seed and you're going to be
[1:44:10] the father of nations and there's going
[1:44:12] to be people and my people going to go
[1:44:14] into bondage and after many years
[1:44:17] they're going to come out.
[1:44:19] &gt;&gt; That's God's program.
[1:44:22] &gt;&gt; God has a nation. God has a people. God
[1:44:24] has a family. God's purpose cannot be
[1:44:27] defeated.
[1:44:30] Amen.
[1:44:30] &gt;&gt; He's already got in his mind a marriage
[1:44:32] table, a marriage supper.
[1:44:34] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. He's going to receive you as
[1:44:37] his wife.
[1:44:39] &gt;&gt; He sent a messenger in this time to tell
[1:44:41] you all about the bride.
[1:44:43] &gt;&gt; This is the first bride message I know
[1:44:45] of.
[1:44:46] &gt;&gt; Your bride, friends.
[1:44:49] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:44:50] &gt;&gt; This is more. This is not just church.
[1:44:53] &gt;&gt; This is not Bible way. That has nothing
[1:44:54] to do with it. is the bride of Jesus
[1:44:57] Christ.
[1:45:00] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:45:03] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:45:04] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:45:07] &gt;&gt; And we skipped around that.
[1:45:10] He says he was the word. And a theophony
[1:45:14] is something. Now a theophony. You have
[1:45:16] a theophony. And a theophony is
[1:45:19] something you could not see. It could be
[1:45:22] here right now. Yet you cannot see it.
[1:45:28] &gt;&gt; And the best way that he the prophet of
[1:45:30] God in this generation could describe it
[1:45:32] and he could only use that description
[1:45:35] because we had got there in the
[1:45:38] countdown in the development of of
[1:45:42] science. He said it's like television
[1:45:48] &gt;&gt; going through the room and you've heard
[1:45:49] it many times but now you need to hear
[1:45:51] it in reference to this service going
[1:45:53] through this room right now is colors
[1:45:57] &gt;&gt; and voices.
[1:45:59] &gt;&gt; He says bodies
[1:46:02] &gt;&gt; are passing through and what television
[1:46:05] will do is catch the signal and channel
[1:46:08] it. They do not create the colors.
[1:46:12] &gt;&gt; The colors might be over in Italy
[1:46:16] &gt;&gt; or in China or some other country,
[1:46:20] &gt;&gt; but it will simply channel what is here
[1:46:23] going through the room.
[1:46:26] &gt;&gt; There's voices going through the room.
[1:46:28] There's all kinds of messages. There's
[1:46:29] all kinds of texting that's going
[1:46:31] through the room. and you have a certain
[1:46:34] you can have a cell phone or some other
[1:46:37] uh piece of equipment that can pick it
[1:46:39] up
[1:46:40] &gt;&gt; and it will tell you exactly what's
[1:46:42] going through the room.
[1:46:46] &gt;&gt; I had an experience which some of you
[1:46:47] know about. I've said it before, but
[1:46:49] I'll just say it very quickly. I was
[1:46:50] preaching in in Norway at a convention
[1:46:52] and and and made those same statement. I
[1:46:55] said, "There's voices going through the
[1:46:56] room." And they had uh they had cameras
[1:46:58] there, video cameras, and some equipment
[1:47:00] that was taking place. And when they
[1:47:02] went to when they went to rehear this
[1:47:05] because they were going to duplicate it,
[1:47:07] right? As I said, and there's voices
[1:47:09] going through the room, a series of
[1:47:11] other voices started coming through the
[1:47:13] room
[1:47:15] &gt;&gt; and there was several languages. There
[1:47:17] was Russian,
[1:47:18] &gt;&gt; there was English,
[1:47:20] &gt;&gt; and there was another two or three
[1:47:22] languages that were on that tape,
[1:47:26] &gt;&gt; and the one they made some inquiry
[1:47:28] because this is it wasn't a garble
[1:47:30] thing. They made some inquiry because it
[1:47:32] was so clear. And it was a radio station
[1:47:35] in Texas that' been off the air for
[1:47:37] about 50 years.
[1:47:41] &gt;&gt; Where was the voice?
[1:47:43] &gt;&gt; And so they inquired about it and said,
[1:47:45] "Well, how will this happen?" And they
[1:47:46] said, "Well, it can go into some, you
[1:47:48] know, to some distant place and and
[1:47:50] bounce off of some satellite, bounce off
[1:47:52] of some planet and come back to the
[1:47:54] Earth." And that's obviously what they
[1:47:56] picked up.
[1:48:00] &gt;&gt; You think these voices aren't up there?
[1:48:03] There's a great voice in heaven
[1:48:06] &gt;&gt; and it's also the voice of the bride of
[1:48:08] Jesus Christ.
[1:48:11] &gt;&gt; When you said, "Oh God,
[1:48:14] &gt;&gt; have your way.
[1:48:16] When you said, "Oh father, I give myself
[1:48:19] to you." You'll hear it again.
[1:48:22] [Applause]
[1:48:24] &gt;&gt; I am thine, oh Lord. I've heard thy
[1:48:27] voice and told thy love to me,
[1:48:32] but I long to rise on the wings of faith
[1:48:36] and be closer drawn to thee. Maybe
[1:48:39] others were just singing a tune, but you
[1:48:41] were singing, "Draw me nearer.
[1:48:44] draw me nearer.
[1:48:47] &gt;&gt; Go and listen to Future Home. Go to the
[1:48:50] end.
[1:48:51] &gt;&gt; And brother Brandon begins to sing
[1:48:55] the old song.
[1:49:00] I'm bound for that beautiful city
[1:49:05] &gt;&gt; the Lord has prepared for his own
[1:49:08] where all the redeemed of all ages
[1:49:12] sing glory around the white throne
[1:49:16] sometimes in his voice breaks I get
[1:49:20] homesick for heaven and the joys that
[1:49:23] I'll behold
[1:49:26] what a joy it will be when my Savior, I
[1:49:30] see
[1:49:32] &gt;&gt; in that city,
[1:49:34] &gt;&gt; beautiful city of gold.
[1:49:39] &gt;&gt; And then he begins to weep.
[1:49:42] &gt;&gt; Why? Because it's a reality. It's not
[1:49:45] just a song. It's not just a tune. It's
[1:49:47] not just a melody. It's a reality.
[1:49:52] &gt;&gt; And we all get homesick. Why do you get
[1:49:54] homesick? Because there's something in
[1:49:56] here calling for it.
[1:50:02] Is that the lights
[1:50:05] &gt;&gt; of whom I see?
[1:50:09] &gt;&gt; Do I see you? I feel a breeze
[1:50:14] from the crystal sea. Is that the Lord
[1:50:18] standing high
[1:50:20] on heaven's balcony?
[1:50:24] If that's the lights of home,
[1:50:26] it's a precious sight to me.
[1:50:33] &gt;&gt; You skipped around
[1:50:38] your eternal home.
[1:50:42] Says he was
[1:50:44] he was a theophony, something that you
[1:50:46] could not see but could be here right
[1:50:48] now. And he just says it's in another
[1:50:51] dimension. It's like television. And
[1:50:52] it's in another dimension. People are
[1:50:55] moving through this room now singing
[1:50:58] colors. Also, your whole being is only
[1:51:01] subject to five senses. Your being is
[1:51:04] subject to five senses. You see, you
[1:51:06] taste, you smell, you hear, and you
[1:51:08] feel,
[1:51:10] only subject to five senses. And you are
[1:51:13] only subject to what the sight has been
[1:51:15] limited to see. But there is, you're
[1:51:18] only limited by what the sight is
[1:51:20] permitted to see.
[1:51:23] But there is another dimension
[1:51:26] that can be seen by the transformation
[1:51:28] of television by television.
[1:51:31] He says now television does not
[1:51:33] manufacture the picture. It only
[1:51:35] channels it into a circuit and then the
[1:51:38] television picks uh the television
[1:51:40] screen picks it up but the picture's
[1:51:42] there to begin with.
[1:51:46] &gt;&gt; Your theophony is there to begin with.
[1:51:49] &gt;&gt; It's another realm. It's another
[1:51:50] channel, but it's here. And I'm
[1:51:52] preaching to see to have you to believe
[1:51:55] it
[1:51:56] &gt;&gt; with everything that's in you.
[1:51:58] &gt;&gt; I want you to say, "I believe in that
[1:51:59] more than I believe in this." Because
[1:52:01] this is passing away, but that will not
[1:52:04] pass away.
[1:52:06] &gt;&gt; It's your inheritance. Reach out and
[1:52:09] take it.
[1:52:17] &gt;&gt; Television was here when Adam was here.
[1:52:19] It was here when Elijah was here. He
[1:52:21] said
[1:52:23] &gt;&gt; when he was on Mount Carmel, it was here
[1:52:25] when Jesus was here
[1:52:27] &gt;&gt; and walked the shores of G. Isn't it
[1:52:29] amazing? Television was here when Jesus
[1:52:30] was here. You never hear of it in the
[1:52:32] Bible. Why? It wasn't for that season,
[1:52:35] but it's for this season because it's no
[1:52:38] shock to you. It's a no-brainer for you.
[1:52:41] You understand it. He said they couldn't
[1:52:43] have believed it back then because it
[1:52:45] would have went over their head. It
[1:52:47] wasn't that God couldn't reveal it, but
[1:52:49] it's beyond them. But it's not beyond
[1:52:52] you.
[1:52:55] &gt;&gt; Are you with me?
[1:52:57] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:53:00] &gt;&gt; And someday
[1:53:02] now follow
[1:53:04] &gt;&gt; God's messenger sent to you.
[1:53:06] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:53:07] &gt;&gt; Follow it close.
[1:53:08] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:53:10] &gt;&gt; The angels. And so he said they wouldn't
[1:53:13] have believed it back then. They
[1:53:14] wouldn't have believed television.
[1:53:16] But now God's teleision
[1:53:20] &gt;&gt; in a prophet form.
[1:53:22] &gt;&gt; It's telling the people about another
[1:53:24] dimension.
[1:53:26] &gt;&gt; It's not the idol, American Idol or the
[1:53:28] Canadian Idol or some other thing on
[1:53:31] television. It's not I Love Lucy or the
[1:53:34] CNN or anything else. It's not that. But
[1:53:37] it's a prophet who saw far beyond those
[1:53:40] channels.
[1:53:43] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:53:43] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:53:46] Listen folks, I'm going to preach.
[1:53:49] &gt;&gt; I want you, especially you kids, you
[1:53:51] listen. This is your generation. God's
[1:53:54] going to hold me may not hold me
[1:53:55] accountable, but he's going to hold you
[1:53:57] accountable. Going to hold you
[1:53:58] accountable for this generation.
[1:54:03] &gt;&gt; I'm preaching not because I have to
[1:54:05] preach.
[1:54:06] &gt;&gt; I'm preaching because I'm a burden man.
[1:54:09] &gt;&gt; You're going to be here. You're going to
[1:54:10] see it. You're going to enter into it.
[1:54:12] And this message came for you.
[1:54:16] [Applause]
[1:54:18] &gt;&gt; They wouldn't have believed it back
[1:54:20] then. But you can believe it today. They
[1:54:22] couldn't have even understood it back
[1:54:23] then. You can understand it today.
[1:54:26] &gt;&gt; Why? Because the church in its
[1:54:29] development
[1:54:30] &gt;&gt; and science and its development have
[1:54:32] gone hand in hand. And that's why the
[1:54:34] church, the science and its development
[1:54:36] have put the heavens have filled it full
[1:54:38] of sounds that now for the first time we
[1:54:41] can retrieve and bring back the
[1:54:44] prophet's message. You can hear brother
[1:54:47] Brandham's voice. You can't hear
[1:54:49] Elijah's voice because they hadn't
[1:54:52] developed it back then.
[1:54:55] &gt;&gt; But Elijah's voice is there the same as
[1:54:58] Jesus voice is there the same as Paul's
[1:55:01] voice is there. And William Brandham's
[1:55:03] voice is there.
[1:55:05] &gt;&gt; And it should mean something more to you
[1:55:07] when they comes and the first thing we
[1:55:09] have on tape. We have these new gadgets.
[1:55:14] &gt;&gt; Recording gadgets.
[1:55:16] &gt;&gt; A God's prophet. The first thing he
[1:55:19] tells us is they got these recording
[1:55:21] gadgets. Just a casual statement. It's
[1:55:24] not a casual statement. He's announcing
[1:55:27] to you these things will be recorded.
[1:55:31] Hallelujah.
[1:55:33] &gt;&gt; And this whole world will be judged by
[1:55:36] that voice.
[1:55:37] [Applause]
[1:55:39] &gt;&gt; It's not his voice. It's thus sayaith
[1:55:41] the Lord.
[1:55:48] [Music]
[1:55:51] And he says, "And so
[1:55:53] as television is here that we can that
[1:55:56] we just think, well, Brother Ed, we've
[1:55:58] heard that so many times that's just,
[1:56:00] you know, let's get on with the
[1:56:02] message." Okay, we'll get on with it.
[1:56:05] And so are angels here.
[1:56:09] Amen.
[1:56:10] &gt;&gt; Do you see them?
[1:56:14] &gt;&gt; You can't reach out these five senses
[1:56:16] and feel them.
[1:56:20] You're Joseph and you're here. So are
[1:56:23] the angels here.
[1:56:25] &gt;&gt; I can't feel it just like that because
[1:56:27] that's one of my five senses.
[1:56:29] &gt;&gt; I felt you. I can speak to you. I can
[1:56:31] hear you. I can see you.
[1:56:36] So are the angels here.
[1:56:39] But the prophet said something further
[1:56:41] that is blessing and you can feel the
[1:56:44] influence. You can't see them but you
[1:56:46] can feel the influence of them.
[1:56:48] &gt;&gt; They're trying to move us to be
[1:56:50] believers.
[1:56:51] &gt;&gt; Believe on it.
[1:56:53] &gt;&gt; Believe on it.
[1:56:55] &gt;&gt; And so is Christ here. Jesus of Nazareth
[1:56:58] who walked with Jordan of Galilee is
[1:57:00] here in this building. Here right now.
[1:57:02] Not in some spooky way. He's here in
[1:57:05] this building if you can believe it.
[1:57:08] &gt;&gt; And by him all things are possible.
[1:57:11] &gt;&gt; I tell you my friends, it becomes a
[1:57:14] little bit scary because
[1:57:16] we could believe for things we're almost
[1:57:18] afraid to believe for.
[1:57:26] &gt;&gt; And so are angels here.
[1:57:31] &gt;&gt; Angels just some big crowd. No, your
[1:57:34] angel,
[1:57:35] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:57:39] &gt;&gt; The one that was stood by your mother,
[1:57:42] your mother's bedside when you came into
[1:57:44] the world, that angel.
[1:57:48] &gt;&gt; And it's before the face of the father.
[1:57:51] &gt;&gt; So, he's not far away.
[1:57:55] &gt;&gt; And he watched over you and brought you
[1:57:57] to this time.
[1:57:59] &gt;&gt; And he preserved you so you could hear
[1:58:01] this service. and he came with you into
[1:58:04] this church.
[1:58:06] &gt;&gt; Do you believe it?
[1:58:10] &gt;&gt; What a message.
[1:58:12] &gt;&gt; And so is Christ here. And to prove it,
[1:58:15] then he just reached into that dimension
[1:58:17] and told you what was happening and told
[1:58:19] you what people told people what they
[1:58:21] did years ago. That's right.
[1:58:25] &gt;&gt; I think of one woman that came before
[1:58:28] him
[1:58:30] and he was so conscious and so kind and
[1:58:33] so considerate
[1:58:35] and know she had suffered and she'd been
[1:58:36] to doctors and doctors and doctors and
[1:58:40] he said, "You've been to doctors and
[1:58:42] they couldn't find it. They couldn't
[1:58:44] find what was wrong." And he moves away
[1:58:47] and he quietly says, "Can I say it?" and
[1:58:51] she gave her consent. He said, "When you
[1:58:54] were a little girl, I think about 8
[1:58:56] years old. Do we have an 8-year-old girl
[1:58:57] here? Anybody ate?"
[1:59:01] Nobody ate. Eight. Right there. When she
[1:59:05] was about your age,
[1:59:08] she fell down a well.
[1:59:10] Can you imagine a man in public
[1:59:14] telling what somebody did maybe 40 years
[1:59:18] ago? When you were a girl, you fell down
[1:59:22] a well. And when you fell down the well,
[1:59:25] it loosened your organs.
[1:59:28] It loosened them. And they've operated
[1:59:30] and they never could find it.
[1:59:33] &gt;&gt; But a prophet found it.
[1:59:36] &gt;&gt; Why? Because it's in another channel.
[1:59:39] Amen.
[1:59:40] &gt;&gt; And God is that concerned about an
[1:59:42] individual and tell them what happened
[1:59:44] when they were 8 years old.
[1:59:47] &gt;&gt; He knew you. You older people.
[1:59:50] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:59:51] &gt;&gt; I remember my youth and I go much over
[1:59:54] my youth in these days and I think about
[1:59:56] it. You know why? Because I see God's
[1:59:58] hand
[2:00:01] &gt;&gt; back there guiding you and something
[2:00:04] inside of you calling out.
[2:00:08] And now help me.
[2:00:10] &gt;&gt; Before you could call out, he says this,
[2:00:12] before you could have a cry in your
[2:00:14] heart, now I'm coming down to what is
[2:00:16] that cry? He said, before you can have
[2:00:18] that cry within, there has to be a
[2:00:21] reality. There has to be the real out
[2:00:23] there that's calling to you.
[2:00:28] &gt;&gt; So my service today, friends, is home is
[2:00:32] calling.
[2:00:34] &gt;&gt; Home is calling. Amen.
[2:00:37] &gt;&gt; In fact is brother Brandham says this.
[2:00:40] I've got all these quotes but I can't go
[2:00:41] on with it. You you listen to what he
[2:00:44] says. He says that like it is in the
[2:00:48] natural when you were in your mother's
[2:00:49] womb. Your mother got a craving. He said
[2:00:53] maybe for cantaloupe
[2:00:55] or something else. And some of you women
[2:00:58] that have carried children know what it
[2:01:00] is. You got a craving for pickles or and
[2:01:03] strange stuff. But he explains it. I
[2:01:07] even went on to Google to see what the
[2:01:08] world thinks about it. The prophet is so
[2:01:10] far beyond Google, they don't even know
[2:01:13] where they're which end is up.
[2:01:17] &gt;&gt; And great scholars and scientists and
[2:01:19] everything else. He puts it in one
[2:01:21] phrase. You in your mother's womb was
[2:01:24] calling for something
[2:01:27] &gt;&gt; and that's why she had this craving. And
[2:01:30] she craved strange stuff because you
[2:01:32] needed it. Your body was calling for it.
[2:01:37] &gt;&gt; And if you say today, you know what,
[2:01:40] brother Ed's message today is like a
[2:01:42] pickle.
[2:01:44] &gt;&gt; Well, you just thank God for the pickle
[2:01:46] &gt;&gt; because it's your body out there that's
[2:01:49] calling for it. You need what you're
[2:01:51] hearing to go there.
[2:01:56] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:01:58] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:01:59] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. I'm not here to win any
[2:02:01] brownie points or anything. We're just
[2:02:04] here to speak what God makes real. And
[2:02:06] this is so real to me, friend. So real.
[2:02:09] And he takes that he takes that perfect
[2:02:11] analogy and says a mother when she's
[2:02:14] carrying a child, she'll crave for
[2:02:16] something and the father will go and do
[2:02:18] whatever. He'll squeeze the pennies and
[2:02:21] whatever to get it for her because
[2:02:23] you're calling for it. And likewise,
[2:02:27] your heavenly home,
[2:02:29] &gt;&gt; your heavenly home, your home is calling
[2:02:33] for it. And he says, "And he will send a
[2:02:36] preacher to the pullpit to preach what
[2:02:40] you need to hear."
[2:02:44] &gt;&gt; Don't blame Don't blame me for this
[2:02:46] service. It's your fault.
[2:02:49] [Music]
[2:02:50] [Applause]
[2:02:58] Your body's calling for Hallelujah. I've
[2:03:02] been feeding on it all week.
[2:03:05] &gt;&gt; I've been feeding out all week cuz my
[2:03:06] body needed it.
[2:03:08] &gt;&gt; And now I'm here to speak it out to you
[2:03:10] cuz your body needs it.
[2:03:12] &gt;&gt; You needed to get there.
[2:03:14] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:03:16] &gt;&gt; You need to You need now to confess and
[2:03:19] put up into the heavens. I believe that
[2:03:22] &gt;&gt; and I want to hear on that day Lord
[2:03:24] Jesus saying I believe your word. I
[2:03:26] believe your messenger. I believe the
[2:03:28] man who spoke it
[2:03:30] &gt;&gt; because it's thus say the Lord according
[2:03:32] to the word of God.
[2:03:40] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:03:41] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[2:03:42] &gt;&gt; Just
[2:03:44] is that all right with John? Good.
[2:03:48] He was preaching about the house at
[2:03:49] home. So I just felt to take it a little
[2:03:54] different direction.
[2:03:57] Now we'll just read these quickly.
[2:04:07] Now we see
[2:04:09] the attribute sons of his spirit
[2:04:13] not yet entered into the word body word
[2:04:16] form body but a theophony.
[2:04:20] He said this body is subject to the word
[2:04:22] and waiting for the earnest change of
[2:04:25] the body.
[2:04:28] &gt;&gt; Melzdc went to meet Abraham
[2:04:31] before he got back home. What a
[2:04:34] beautiful type. Here we have Melchzdc
[2:04:36] &gt;&gt; who was a theophony. We know that
[2:04:38] meeting Abraham before he got back home
[2:04:42] after the battle.
[2:04:45] &gt;&gt; We meet Jesus in the air before we get
[2:04:48] home.
[2:04:49] &gt;&gt; And I'd like to tell you that this
[2:04:51] message was his appearing.
[2:04:53] &gt;&gt; He's appearing to us. He said
[2:04:56] &gt;&gt; we have met Jesus before getting home.
[2:05:00] &gt;&gt; And you say, "Well, we meet him in the
[2:05:02] sky." Well, wherever this guy is, I can
[2:05:04] tell you that there's another realm.
[2:05:06] There's another dimension.
[2:05:07] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:05:09] &gt;&gt; And we're meeting him now.
[2:05:12] &gt;&gt; You believe it?
[2:05:16] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:05:16] &gt;&gt; We meet Jesus in the air before we get
[2:05:19] home. Therefore, the theophony,
[2:05:24] if you have died and entered into that
[2:05:26] theophony, what happens? The theophony
[2:05:30] comes to the earth. Amen.
[2:05:32] &gt;&gt; To pick up the redeemed body.
[2:05:35] &gt;&gt; And if you're in the air, you take the
[2:05:38] body to meet the theophony.
[2:05:41] &gt;&gt; There you are. And caught up and go to
[2:05:43] meet the Lord in the air. Who is this?
[2:05:45] Melisedc but God. He says in another
[2:05:48] place, this mortal body and the
[2:05:50] theophony body and the resurrected body,
[2:05:53] which is the glorified, the three of
[2:05:55] them make the glorified body your
[2:05:57] eternal home. Now look it, just listen
[2:06:00] close. Jesus said to the disciples, he
[2:06:03] said, "There are some of you that shall
[2:06:05] not see death until you see uh the
[2:06:08] kingdom of God and coming in its power."
[2:06:11] And after 6 days he taketh up Peter,
[2:06:14] James, and John three is a witness up
[2:06:17] into the mount transfiguration.
[2:06:20] And on the mountain he was transfigured
[2:06:23] before them. And on the mountain was
[2:06:26] Elijah and Moses. Elijah had been
[2:06:29] raptured. Moses had died. But all both
[2:06:32] of them were there. So there was the the
[2:06:34] rapture, the resurrection, and Jesus
[2:06:38] glorified
[2:06:40] and three witnesses of the earth. There
[2:06:43] was three there in a mortal body, one
[2:06:46] that had had a rapture, one who had died
[2:06:48] and resurrected. And Jesus glorified
[2:06:52] Mount Transfiguration.
[2:06:56] Hallelujah.
[2:06:59] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:07:01] &gt;&gt; All standing on the earth.
[2:07:05] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:07:06] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:07:07] &gt;&gt; Where is it in the skies?
[2:07:10] &gt;&gt; Where's the skies?
[2:07:12] &gt;&gt; Oh, religion and all of that. Sunday
[2:07:15] school stories have told you someplace
[2:07:16] up there and heaven's 150 million light
[2:07:19] years. Don't you believe it? A prophet
[2:07:22] said he's going to renovate this earth
[2:07:24] &gt;&gt; and you're going to live here
[2:07:26] &gt;&gt; and you'll travel like a thought.
[2:07:30] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:07:32] [Music]
[2:07:35] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:07:37] &gt;&gt; One woman came to the old brother. He
[2:07:40] didn't have the message such as we have
[2:07:41] it. But the old brother that led me into
[2:07:43] the ministry and she came to him and she
[2:07:46] said, "Brother McFraf,
[2:07:49] is there going to be any horses in
[2:07:51] heaven?" And he didn't have the message,
[2:07:54] but he says, "Well, I don't know." He
[2:07:55] said, "If there if we don't," he says,
[2:07:56] "we'll just create a few." Says, "You
[2:07:59] want them with pink polka dots or
[2:08:01] whatever kind of horse you want, we'll
[2:08:02] just create them." Cuz we, he says,
[2:08:04] we're going to be like him. that one
[2:08:05] thing he knew uh we're going to be like
[2:08:07] him and he's a creator and so we have to
[2:08:09] be like him.
[2:08:10] &gt;&gt; That was his solution.
[2:08:14] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:08:21] &gt;&gt; And caught up to meet the Lord in the
[2:08:23] air. Who is this Melzdc? But God.
[2:08:26] &gt;&gt; Our own life is just a pattern. It's
[2:08:29] just a shadow. Look at yourself. You
[2:08:32] can't right now, but look at your
[2:08:34] neighbor.
[2:08:36] your shadow neighbor. Some are going to
[2:08:39] say, "Wow, I wish I was a shadow."
[2:08:43] But we're just shadow
[2:08:46] and not the real thing.
[2:08:49] Hello, brother.
[2:08:51] Not the real thing.
[2:08:54] A friend of mine, excuse me, he was in
[2:08:56] Alaska and he played the bass fiddle and
[2:08:58] he was there with Brother McGriff and
[2:09:00] his son and they were on the platform
[2:09:02] playing and he was very, very shy.
[2:09:05] And so they're saying and the pastor
[2:09:07] said, "Now we want these people to
[2:09:08] introduce themselves."
[2:09:10] And so brother McGriff said who he was
[2:09:12] and Norman said who he was. And this
[2:09:14] brother, very dear friend of mine, used
[2:09:16] to be a a deacon in my church. He was
[2:09:18] just terribly shy. And he kind of hid
[2:09:20] behind the the big bass fiddle. He says,
[2:09:23] "It don't matter." And the people
[2:09:25] laughed because they knew him. Some of
[2:09:27] the people knew him. So they laughed.
[2:09:29] His name was Vern. And so they laughed
[2:09:32] and and he said, "Don't laugh." He said,
[2:09:34] "That's just fine, brother. Don't
[2:09:35] matter. That does, you know, we've heard
[2:09:37] stranger names and that or whatever."
[2:09:39] And he just thought that that was his
[2:09:41] name. Don't matter. Well, Brother
[2:09:43] Brandham says, "We're not the real
[2:09:45] thing." How are you, brother? Not the
[2:09:47] real thing.
[2:09:49] Hallelujah. But you do have a real
[2:09:51] thing. You have a real body. You have a
[2:09:54] real place. You have a real home. And
[2:09:56] guess what? Home is calling, folks.
[2:09:58] &gt;&gt; That's why you're in the season that
[2:10:00] you're in. Home is calling. out on the
[2:10:03] internet. Home is calling.
[2:10:08] &gt;&gt; Is that the lights of home?
[2:10:12] &gt;&gt; Is that the voice
[2:10:13] &gt;&gt; that I hear?
[2:10:15] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[2:10:16] &gt;&gt; From heaven's balcony. Oh, that's the
[2:10:19] lights of home.
[2:10:21] &gt;&gt; It's a wonderful thing. It's a wonderful
[2:10:23] sight to me. Amen.
[2:10:31] &gt;&gt; It takes death to develop the picture
[2:10:34] &gt;&gt; to put us back in the theophony we come
[2:10:36] from. Then in the resurrection, we come
[2:10:39] in his likeness, a resurrected body.
[2:10:43] What a beautiful, not only beautiful,
[2:10:45] but it's the real solemn truth of God's
[2:10:50] eternal word.
[2:10:52] Hallelujah.
[2:10:54] Isn't that wonderful, friends
[2:10:57] &gt;&gt; to be in that season?
[2:11:01] &gt;&gt; We're not here for a long time,
[2:11:04] &gt;&gt; but we should be here for a wonderful
[2:11:05] time.
[2:11:07] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:11:10] &gt;&gt; Brother Ryan, I need you up here,
[2:11:14] Brother Derek.
[2:11:26] Thank you.
[2:11:28] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Father. God bless you.
[2:11:31] Hallelujah.
[2:11:38] Amen.
[2:11:42] The reason why I want you to enjoy it is
[2:11:44] cuz I'm enjoying it. Amen.
[2:11:46] &gt;&gt; God bless you, brother Wes.
[2:11:50] &gt;&gt; Dian Nyard,
[2:11:53] &gt;&gt; Zach,
[2:11:54] young lady,
[2:11:57] Jessica.
[2:12:00] &gt;&gt; I'm sure you're all happy
[2:12:02] &gt;&gt; that dad is still here.
[2:12:05] [Applause]
[2:12:05] [Music]
[2:12:09] [Applause]
[2:12:10] [Music]
[2:12:15] We're not done yet, brother Wes.
[2:12:18] &gt;&gt; Something yet to do.
[2:12:20] &gt;&gt; Some reflection
[2:12:22] &gt;&gt; of our Lord Jesus Christ
[2:12:24] &gt;&gt; that only you can do
[2:12:26] &gt;&gt; because you've been chosen to reflect
[2:12:28] him.
[2:12:29] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:12:31] &gt;&gt; But don't we appreciate God's sons and
[2:12:33] daughters?
[2:12:35] &gt;&gt; Appreciate you. Appreciate you young
[2:12:36] people. Appreciate it with all my heart.
[2:12:38] Hallelujah. I say go for it.
[2:12:41] &gt;&gt; Go for the kingdom.
[2:12:45] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:12:46] [Applause]
[2:12:48] &gt;&gt; I was younger than most of you when I
[2:12:51] still had that same fire and same zeal.
[2:12:53] And I can tell you it never needs to go
[2:12:55] out. The flame never needs to go out. Do
[2:12:58] what you can. Wherever you can and make
[2:13:01] the right confession. If you make your
[2:13:03] mistakes and you fall down, don't stay
[2:13:05] there. The prophet said you'll get up. A

[2:20:33] First off, let me say how blessed we are
[2:20:36] and how blessed I am to be here
[2:20:41] &gt;&gt; and how thankful for the word that we
[2:20:44] have heard and received. Amen.
[2:20:48] &gt;&gt; Um,
[2:20:49] [Music]
[2:20:51] &gt;&gt; I thank God primarily for that
[2:20:55] that he saw fit to bring me here
[2:20:58] and bring me back here to bring me his
[2:21:00] word to manifest his word in me and to
[2:21:04] see it in this day and age.
[2:21:09] &gt;&gt; If I can do this, um,
[2:21:13] I want to thank the ministry. I want to
[2:21:15] thank God for having his hand upon me.
[2:21:19] Um, I'm a miracle.
[2:21:22] &gt;&gt; Um,
[2:21:23] &gt;&gt; praise God.
[2:21:26] [Music]
[2:21:29] &gt;&gt; I stand here as a miracle of God's
[2:21:32] healing hand
[2:21:35] and as a testimony and as a miracle of
[2:21:39] your prayers.
[2:21:41] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:21:43] &gt;&gt; I want to thank the ministry. I don't
[2:21:44] know how Brother Ed made it so quick
[2:21:46] down to Bellingham.
[2:21:50] I want to thank God for my family, for a
[2:21:53] wife. She's doing everything.
[2:21:58] For my family that know how bullheaded I
[2:22:00] am that got me into the hospital.
[2:22:03] Um
[2:22:04] I'm a miracle.
[2:22:07] Um,
[2:22:09] &gt;&gt; I have been told by uh doctors,
[2:22:13] by physical therapist, "Wow, what a
[2:22:16] surprise. You're a miracle.
[2:22:20] Things aren't going fast enough for me,
[2:22:22] but they're going great." Especially
[2:22:25] when the right side of my body was a
[2:22:27] chunk of meat.
[2:22:29] [Music]
[2:22:32] I checked in the hospital.
[2:22:35] Blood pressure 217 over 138. And they
[2:22:39] couldn't get it down.
[2:22:42] Wow. They pumped so much stuff into me.
[2:22:45] I thought,
[2:22:47] how much more can my body take?
[2:22:50] I have no idea how brother Ed made it so
[2:22:52] quick down there.
[2:22:54] My son, my wife were there and they're a
[2:22:58] comfort.
[2:23:00] But there's something about your pastor
[2:23:02] being there. Amen.
[2:23:04] &gt;&gt; What a comfort.
[2:23:06] So, I think I had about eight or 10 IOS
[2:23:08] thrown into me to get my blood pressure
[2:23:10] down and it wouldn't come down.
[2:23:13] I'm going, "Wow, that's interesting."
[2:23:18] I saw a man of God pray
[2:23:22] and probably uh 5 seconds 3 to five and
[2:23:24] they took the cough off said 110 get
[2:23:27] them out of here. They were waiting for
[2:23:29] it to get down to 110 and it wouldn't go
[2:23:31] there.
[2:23:33] 130 135
[2:23:37] wow
[2:23:39] this is interesting.
[2:23:41] I can assure you that somebody was in
[2:23:42] control not me. Amen.
[2:23:44] &gt;&gt; The hand of God was there.
[2:23:46] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:23:46] &gt;&gt; I covet your prayers. I thank you for
[2:23:48] your prayers. Each and every one of
[2:23:50] them, the phone calls, the uh
[2:23:53] &gt;&gt; you have no concept about
[2:23:56] the strength.
[2:23:57] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[2:23:58] &gt;&gt; Um
[2:24:00] Brother Ken came down and prayed for me.
[2:24:02] He said, and in his prayer, he said,
[2:24:04] "Thank you, God, for the thousands of
[2:24:05] people around the world that are praying
[2:24:07] for you. And I thank you from China to
[2:24:09] brother Ron's church to brother Lance's
[2:24:12] to just my brother Ddier and brother
[2:24:13] Ddier sent message with sister Barbara
[2:24:16] Graham saying hey we're he sent some
[2:24:18] kind words and said we're praying for
[2:24:19] you it's the prayers and the prayers of
[2:24:22] a righteous man avaleth much righteous
[2:24:25] sister um
[2:24:29] it's not going quick enough for me but
[2:24:30] my wife said wow if you could have seen
[2:24:32] yourself when you're in the hospital
[2:24:34] but I stand before you as a miracle
[2:24:38] But you have no concept the number of
[2:24:40] miracles that have occurred.
[2:24:42] &gt;&gt; I mean it just for my blood pressure
[2:24:44] going down, brother Ed
[2:24:46] wouldn't go down. A man of God praise
[2:24:49] and it goes
[2:24:51] &gt;&gt; to were walking and I hope Am I taking
[2:24:53] too much time, Brother Ed? Am I taking
[2:24:55] too much time?
[2:24:56] &gt;&gt; No.
[2:24:57] &gt;&gt; Okay. Just a just to kind of skip over
[2:25:00] the miracles as quick as I could to
[2:25:01] touch a couple of them. Brother Ed made
[2:25:03] it down and he prays. My blood pressure
[2:25:05] goes down and
[2:25:07] so they take me into the ICU and I'm
[2:25:10] laying on this gurnie and
[2:25:13] on a venture I've never been on before
[2:25:14] in my life. And
[2:25:17] all a sudden my wife is next to me and I
[2:25:19] hear this word this song. I'm going I'm
[2:25:21] not dead. And then sister Arlene Weston
[2:25:27] [Music]
[2:25:40] My wife had her iPhone in her pocket.
[2:25:45] Now you talk about odd things happening.
[2:25:49] [Music]
[2:26:00] Sorry.
[2:26:04] Her cell phone turns on. Thank you.
[2:26:10] And Hog goes from the phone to the music
[2:26:14] to find Sister Arling Weston. I know
[2:26:16] she's been married. I don't know her
[2:26:17] maiden or her new name, but it's uh
[2:26:21] we're going into ICU and it's she pulls
[2:26:25] it out and like I said, I didn't think I
[2:26:26] was dead,
[2:26:28] but it's greater works than these. And
[2:26:30] she pulls it out and she turns up the
[2:26:32] volume and we're walking down the hall.
[2:26:34] Poor guy pushing the gurnie must have
[2:26:35] thought, what's with these people? And
[2:26:37] the lady in the ICU, the head nurse kind
[2:26:39] of goes, what's going on? are walking
[2:26:41] down the hall and our sister Arlene
[2:26:43] Weston is singing greater works than
[2:26:45] these.
[2:26:47] Wow. So, the miracles on top of miracles
[2:26:49] on top of miracles and brother Ken,
[2:26:51] you've put me into a guilt trip. I had a
[2:26:54] thousands of people praying for me when
[2:26:55] I'm laying on my back doing my my
[2:26:58] physical therapy myself. My ankle
[2:27:00] doesn't turn and I'm
[2:27:02] &gt;&gt; I got to think I've got thousands of
[2:27:03] people around the world praying for me
[2:27:05] and you lifted me up.
[2:27:08] You know, uh, Brother Tom and Brother
[2:27:10] John came down and I was so proud the
[2:27:12] day before. I think I touched my finger.
[2:27:14] I couldn't do it the next day.
[2:27:16] Exhausting. But the strength of the
[2:27:19] prayer is what brought me through. And
[2:27:21] we've heard time and time again, even
[2:27:24] last week, I went to my general doctor
[2:27:25] and he said, "What's happened to you?"
[2:27:28] You're a no, excuse me. He said, "From
[2:27:30] what? What happened to you? You're doing
[2:27:33] incredible."
[2:27:34] went to the neuro the neurologist and
[2:27:36] the neurologist took a look and said,
[2:27:38] "Wow, you can walk. You're this is a
[2:27:40] miracle." And he looked at my eyes and
[2:27:42] he said, "Wow." He said, "Usually where
[2:27:45] people have a stroke in this portion of
[2:27:46] the brain, they're crosseyed."
[2:27:48] I'm not crosseyed. I can see my brothers
[2:27:50] and sisters.
[2:27:53] &gt;&gt; So, uh, that's just a few of the
[2:27:55] miracles. I'm sorry. I just had to go
[2:27:56] ahead and say
[2:27:58] &gt;&gt; your prayers. your prayers.
[2:28:01] &gt;&gt; And
[2:28:06] &gt;&gt; the greatest thing of all is the word
[2:28:08] that we've received for this hour.
[2:28:12] &gt;&gt; And I'm here and brother Raphael gave me
[2:28:14] a call and he said, like you said this
[2:28:16] morning, Brother Ed, he brother Wes, he
[2:28:19] said, God has something more for you to
[2:28:21] do. He gave me my arm and you have no
[2:28:24] idea how great it is to be able to raise
[2:28:26] your arm
[2:28:27] &gt;&gt; and praise the Lord.
[2:28:29] [Applause]
[2:28:35] [Music]
[2:28:38] When this chunk of meat here doesn't
[2:28:40] move, you have no idea how great it is
[2:28:41] to be able to get back down on your
[2:28:43] knees and praise and pray to God.
[2:28:47] &gt;&gt; That is an honor.
[2:28:52] &gt;&gt; I stand before you as a miracle. The
[2:28:54] hand of God has touched me. He's not
[2:28:56] finished with me. He's not finished with
[2:28:58] us. Brother Cardo,
[2:29:00] &gt;&gt; Sister Shmaine, he's in the arms. He's
[2:29:03] in the legs. And I guess if the greatest
[2:29:05] thing, cuz I would probably ask my kids
[2:29:07] this, I'd say, "What have you learned
[2:29:09] from all this?"
[2:29:12] I'm sure that I'm going to learn a lot
[2:29:14] more. But I can tell you unequivocally,
[2:29:17] he loves me.
[2:29:19] &gt;&gt; He loves you
[2:29:21] &gt;&gt; more than we will ever know. and he's
[2:29:24] into everything, every aspect of our
[2:29:27] life. If we're concerned, he's
[2:29:29] concerned. And I can't tell you the
[2:29:33] with the body being whacked out the way
[2:29:35] mine was. And I was out of control.
[2:29:38] Brother Ed's holding my hand and praying
[2:29:40] for me.
[2:29:43] [Music]
[2:29:46] His hand was there. He was there. He was
[2:29:48] in that room.
[2:29:49] &gt;&gt; And he was with me. And he's with us.
[2:29:51] And he cares for me. He cares for you
[2:29:55] more than we'll ever ever know.
[2:29:58] &gt;&gt; But thank you for your prayers. Thank
[2:30:00] you, Lord, for your hand upon me. I give
[2:30:03] you all the praise and all the glory.
[2:30:08] Let's just pray.
[2:30:11] [Music]
[2:30:15] Gracious heavenly father,
[2:30:18] Lord God, what a privilege it is to be
[2:30:23] in the house of God
[2:30:29] &gt;&gt; to be able to hear and receive

[2:30:36] Father, you've taken the scales from our
[2:30:38] eyes.

[2:30:47] mountain, Lord.

[2:30:51] inheritance.

[2:31:42] that you have given us and placed in our
[2:31:44] life to receive that Lord. Father
[2:31:48] you've been so wonderful to us Lord we
[2:31:51] thank you for it Lord. Father we just
[2:31:53] want to pray a prayer of blessing upon
[2:31:57] each and everyone that's here this
[2:31:58] morning Lord God. Father would you just
[2:32:04] be with us in the quietness of our mind
[2:32:06] Lord God in our meditations. Father,
[2:32:09] may perhaps somebody didn't understand
[2:32:11] all of it, Lord God. But heavenly
[2:32:13] father, you've been so kind. Speak to
[2:32:16] us, Lord God. Continue to deal with us,
[2:32:19] Father, is our prayer, Lord. Father, we
[2:32:21] just want to say we love you. We
