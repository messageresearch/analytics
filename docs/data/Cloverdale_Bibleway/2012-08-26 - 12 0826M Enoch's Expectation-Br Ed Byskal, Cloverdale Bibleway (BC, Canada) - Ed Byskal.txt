Oh, and you love [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Isn't he wonderful? &gt;&gt; Praise God. Praise God. Well, we are uh we're in the after effects, the ripple effects of the of the wedding that took place and uh we rejoiced with the young couple that were married and brother Kyle and brother John took the ceremony and it was really really special. But we're now here on the Lord's day. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen. &gt;&gt; Special day. &gt;&gt; Amen. Feel his divine presence. &gt;&gt; Amen. We're so thankful for what he's done in our time. &gt;&gt; Amen. I want to uh I'm going to be speaking to you in a few moments and I'm going to speak to you on Enoch's expectation. Amen. &gt;&gt; And I would like you to be mindful during the service, during the reading, some of the reading of the scriptures, fairly lengthy, but I'd like you to prepare yourself and even pray now. God, give me insight. I've read those scriptures before, but give me insight in the light of the message. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Because this message came to reveal Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; Amen. That's what people miss so much when we talk about the message. They get caught up in the, you know, the semantics or they get caught up in the uh some mental reasoning or some precision of it and fail to realize that the purpose of the message is to reveal Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; And Jesus Christ is this word. &gt;&gt; Amen. So you can read volumes of scripture and people do &gt;&gt; millions today have the scripture in their home or in their church or wherever more on their lap uh in a service but don't understand what it really says. And so I I trust that you will be able to um grasp even more. I'm just I'm I feel real urgency to pour out all that is within my heart uh as much as possible for the hour that we're in. &gt;&gt; And when we think of Enoch, we sometimes think of, well, Enoch walked with God and he was not for God took him. It sounds so nice and, you know, so quiet and so peaceful. But I'm going to read a scripture which you have read many times where Bible says that Enoch prophesied of the judgment of God. &gt;&gt; And he didn't prophesy for a service or a week or an hour on the Sabbath day. He prophesied for probably 330 years. &gt;&gt; And he saw it coming. And so this is some of the things that I want to go into. Um, but before we do, I want to make a formal announcement with regards to uh the website that's been known as the Believe the Sign, which is quite a paradox. Uh, because I've had I've had some inquiry. I've had some phone calls, not many, uh, two or three, but I think they're important and people want to know. And so we have many that are streaming today, perhaps many more streaming than are actually sitting here in the service. And so I want them to know and the question has been uh presented to me. Is it our website? No, it's not our website. Never has been our website. And so I just want to give some excuse me some former ex uh for formal explanation. Neither Cloverdale Bible Way nor Bible Believers have ever been connected or have sponsored have not sponsored uh the website Believe the Sign. This website has absolutely no connection with this church or with Bible believers. Uh several years ago, a brother who at that time attended this church expressed a desire to uh design a website to make known the supernatural things which took place in brother Brandham's ministry. Uh thus believe the sign website was produced and became available to internet users. Many church and other websites including our own had a link to believe the sign website and it could be found on many many different websites. Uh the brother who designed the website left this church about 3 years ago and some months ago so I hope you're following that. Some months ago, I became aware uh that believe the signed website was carrying material from authors opposed to brother Brham's ministry. And they referred to the article as prophecies and I deny that they are not prophecies. And if you say they're prophecies, I want to know under whose authority they are claimed to be uh prophecies. It would be good for the authors of the supporters of the website, Believe the Sign, to go on to Google and find out how many false prophecies those authors made. &gt;&gt; I immediately gave instructions to remove the link uh to believe the sign website from our website. And this was actually done within minutes of my uh being made aware of the material they were carrying. Incidentally, the material they were carrying certainly wasn't new to me. It's old stuff. And uh prophecies coming 50 years after the fact. &gt;&gt; I thought a prophecy is foretelling. We do not support this material. There is in my view they're false prophecies. &gt;&gt; And so I say to this congregation and all that will hear my voice now or on the archives. Let the blind lead the blind. &gt;&gt; Has nothing to do with believers. &gt;&gt; Don't occupy yourself with it. &gt;&gt; Well, it's on this it's on this social network. Forget the social network. &gt;&gt; Our social network is called a vindicated message. &gt;&gt; That's where we have our our society in our gathering. &gt;&gt; And I hope that you remember that. &gt;&gt; Amen. It's indeed sad that men who once fellowshipped as believers and partook in communion and footwashing were baptized in the lovely name of the Lord Jesus Christ have become and I say this respectfully enemies &gt;&gt; of the very re revelation of Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; To say that brother Brandham was not the fulfillment of Malachi 4 to me is almost blasphemous. And I would say anyone who takes that position is standing on very very dangerous ground. I cannot think of anything more frightening &gt;&gt; than to become associated with this kind of uh direction or I will say to become associated with those that have become enemies of the revelation of Jesus Christ &gt;&gt; according to Luke 17:30 to deny I that the prophet of God was sent to reveal Jesus Christ is to is to take away the very foundations of my life. &gt;&gt; How many others? &gt;&gt; This message was lifechanging. &gt;&gt; I heard all those prophecies 50 years ago and more. Listen to me folks. I experienced all this stuff. This was full of confusion. &gt;&gt; Absolute confusion. Multitudes were confused and are still confused. &gt;&gt; And a few words out of this messenger's mouth &gt;&gt; just resolved and took away all the questions, took away all the cloud. And you young younger generation who have not experienced that, take it from an eyewitness and take it from someone. I'm glad that my testimony as far to my knowledge has never been on that site and and I would have gladly have given it but I'm glad it's not there today. &gt;&gt; And to those who perhaps signed on with this influence but perhaps today are not in favor would not support it. It would be a good thing for them to ask within themselves, when were the seeds &gt;&gt; of this doubt actually sown in those hearts &gt;&gt; and did they sign on with it, not realizing or should have perhaps been given some divine understanding, divine discernment. I'll tell you what, we need discerning of spirits in these days. &gt;&gt; Not necessarily discerning of people, discerning of spirits. That's what the Bible says. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; There's only two forces. The prophet said, &gt;&gt; Satan and God. And what's Satan's weapon against you is to try to get you to disbelieve your weapon. &gt;&gt; And he disarms you. Right? &gt;&gt; He said, "If he can get you to disbelieve your weapon, &gt;&gt; that your weapon is equivalent, &gt;&gt; if he gets you to believe that your weapon is not strong enough, he's disarmed you. &gt;&gt; He wants you to know your weapon is strong enough. &gt;&gt; Is equivalent to anything he can cast at you or more." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He disarms you. And when he gets you to disbelieve that weapon, when you lay that down, that finishes your fight, you've you're done. Hold that weapon. &gt;&gt; Don't you lay it down. &gt;&gt; We see we see his unbelief and he's been a unbeliever from the beginning. &gt;&gt; Amen. I wanted to needed to make that Jesus said in Matthew 24 and Luke 21 I believe and Mark in Mark's gospel as well but Luke 21:31 they describe the conditions and I will be speaking of these conditions some today he described the conditions of the end time and now listen friends I I don't want you just be here at a church service. I want you to be here as a participant and by your presence you are stating I am believing this end time message. &gt;&gt; Is that all right? &gt;&gt; All right. And in so doing Jesus described the conditions of our time. It shouldn't take us unawares. He described the conditions of our time and he said when you see these things, &gt;&gt; he didn't say be downhearted or be downcast or to be clouded over. When you see these things, we rejoice &gt;&gt; because these things were to take place. And when we see them, it should inspire faith &gt;&gt; in our hearts. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; These things must be. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And it may get worse. Some ages had physical persecution and now in this age it becomes more a mind thing because that's a mind generation mind age. Well, and I'm going to be having some slides a little later on, but I want to um I I want to sing a verse or two of a song and have you stand with me and you'll sing my pace. Musicians, uh what is it? Beautiful robe. What a number. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. Uh, do we have it up? What is it? Beautiful robe. We got it up. Beautiful home. Beautiful robe. Just a moment here. Beautiful rope. So white. All right. Here we are. Okay. Give us a star. Do you know it? Beautiful land of thy soul where there shall come your night beautiful crown where shining with stars or there yonder in manions fair gather us there beautiful road beautiful Wow. Beautiful. [Music] [Music] Gather us there. Beautiful father. We shall forever in eternity. [Music] Heavenly joy to share. [Music] Beautiful. Beautiful. [Music] [Music] [Music] bright beautiful things on My God [Music] is my [Music] sorrow. Heat. Heat. [Music] [Music] [Music] Second verse once again. Beautiful thought to me. We are forever. [Music] [Music] Heat. Heat. Heat. [Music] Oh, and beautiful. Beautiful shining away. Beautiful manion gather us there. [Music] Amen. &gt;&gt; Glory to God. Next Sunday, the second is the last Sunday before school starts. School starts the following week. And we want to spend some of the morning service in the direction of uh we're going to have prayer naturally for all the families and the young people, the children, but it's not just a school. We want to give our thoughts towards what the that effort and the sacrifice that was put in bringing that building together in that facility and the teachers that will be here and the principal our brother Terry Tatch and his wife Shel've been working hard and many others. We want you to be mindful of what that is to produce. It is to bring forth, cultivate young men, young ladies for the kingdom of God. That's the purpose of it. And uh while I have that in mind, so that's next Sunday the second. And we want to say that brother David and Naomi Roy are happy to announce the arrival of Arajoy. Ara is the pronunciation. born on Friday, August the 24th, weighing 6 lb 6 oz. And when she weighs a little bit more and is a few more years under her belt, I trust you'll be over there if we're not up there. &gt;&gt; Is that all right? &gt;&gt; God bless you. Now, I'd like to have your full attention as we turn to the scripture. And incidentally, just a a moment uh before we're going to read the scripture, you know, when I make a formal announcement such as I did, don't be caught up with the atmosphere of Leodysa. Oh, we don't want to step on anybody's toes. Jesus stepped on lots of people's toes. &gt;&gt; And he said it the way it is. &gt;&gt; And that's the way we've got to be, friends. And we don't only have, you know, uplifting things, but we also have warnings. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And those of you, I ask if you have your Bibles today, if you're here and you don't have a Bible and you haven't brought a Bible, bring your Bible to church &gt;&gt; so that you have it so we can read it together. All right. I'll have you turn in your Bibles to Genesis, the 5th chapter. We have two places where we're going to read. Genesis 5 and also Luke, I'm sorry, Jude. All right, let's just bow our heads in prayer. Almighty God, creator of heavens and earth and giver of every good gift, we are so dependent upon you. &gt;&gt; We are so in love, oh God, with you. just uh even this morning and yesterday and this morning especially, Father, seeing your hand move in such a mighty supernatural way uh uh uh and vindicating and confirming your divine presence, the supernatural God. Confirm your presence here this morning, Lord. We've seen, Father, where you've come and have met needs of individuals, Lord, and let our needs be met. I pray in the name of Jesus Christ. Father, I pray that you will do something of such a special nature for the individuals that are here, we've gathered here with a divine purpose and a divine expectation. And as I seek to approach God Enoch's expectation, I pray that we will translate it to our expectation in the name of Jesus Christ and for his glory alone, for no flesh shall glory in his presence. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Starting at the 21st verse. And Enoch lived 60 and five years and begat Methuselah. And Enoch walked with God after he begat Methuselah 300 years and begat sons and daughters. And all the days of Enoch were 365 years. And Enoch walked with God, and he was not, for God took him. &gt;&gt; And then I'd like to have you turn to the book of Jude, which is the little book just before Revelation. And there's only one chapter in it, 25 verses. I will read verse 14 and 15. And Enoch also the seventh from Adam prophesied of these, saying, "Behold, the Lord cometh with 10 thousands of his saints to execute judgment upon all, and to convince all that are ungodly among them, of all their ungodly deeds which they have ungodly committed, and of all their hard speeches which ungodly sinners have spoken, against him. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It's amazing that Enoch was involved &gt;&gt; in that kind of ministry. &gt;&gt; Say, Enoch walked with God. The truth of the matter is Enoch prophesied and preached this kind of gospel &gt;&gt; to execute judgment. &gt;&gt; Amen. because the because the the whole the whole civilization of his time was going so weward and was so uh God was so displeased and he preached for many many years and prophesied and that faith that gave him faith when he saw those conditions that gave him faith for his rapture. &gt;&gt; Amen. You may be seated. I'd like your kind attention and just little as movement as possible please. Enoch is a type of the raptured church in the great coming revival. Brother Brandham said in that message and Enoch of course was a type of the raptured group of the church. &gt;&gt; Notice how he says the raptured group of the church. Enoch was raptured. This is in the rapture message. Now, Enoch was raptured, the seventh, showing that it's the seventh church age that takes the rapture. And now, there's no doubt that we're living in the seventh church age. &gt;&gt; I just want to say very, very directly, what do we expect in this day and age? Do we expect an easy time? Are we expecting a flowery bed of roses to go? No, we don't expect that. This is a battle and the prophet said we're going to fight for every inch of the way. &gt;&gt; Amen. When I see, you know, or even sense an attitude of kind of, you know, just easy and go along with things and I I resist that very much because that is not the program of God's believers. It's not been the program of the church. It's not the program of believers. It wasn't how the church was birthed and soon as soon as the uh spirit of God, the Holy Spirit came and filled the believers. They immediately were persecuted. &gt;&gt; They immediately had opposition. Is that not true? &gt;&gt; And if the church has anything less than that, then there's something wrong with the church. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; And and uh you know in in this day and age when we look at the world, it's just all accept everybody just for what they are and so on and so forth. That's not the believer's position. &gt;&gt; Like the prophet said, you know, in his time there was the the theme was we're all one. &gt;&gt; So he just said clearly, we're not one. &gt;&gt; You're not one with some of that stuff. &gt;&gt; And you want to you want to say glory to God. I'm glad I'm not one with all of that. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; There are two things that I am wanting to draw your attention to and I'm going to watch my time, but uh I I I want this service to be a blessing to you. Uh there's two things about Enoch's life. In fact, there's about three uh that uh uh that refer to us. Number one, the conditions that existed and which Enoch had to live in. We don't often think of that. In fact, this I have to say myself and I make a confession. I've thought of Enoch, you know, he walked with God and and he was not for God took him. We think just how wonderful that is. But we forget that he lived for many, many years with se severe and stiff opposition. And he preached a message that is not easy to preach and lived a life that was not that easy to live. &gt;&gt; But Enoch walked hearing the voice of God. And this is really the the crux of my message this morning. Walking with the voice. He walked with God. But God wasn't just some silent distant form or force someplace. God God had allowed him to know that the the direction the people were leave living was a direction of destruction. &gt;&gt; It was going to be a fierce destruction. And friends, I want to say that the destruction that this world is headed for now is is not like the one they went through which was water but this this time it's fire. Right. &gt;&gt; And the third thing, the intimate relationship of walking with and in the word of God put Enoch into a state of heightened expectation. Now, when you expect something, if you expect some friends or if you expect some family to come and say, "Well, uh, our family's going to come and visit, uh, you know, three weeks from now." Well, you start getting excited, but as the time draws near, someone you haven't seen, someone that is dear, someone that is precious to you, oh, and you're so anxious to see them, and the day comes. Well, you're you're you're listening for every sound. Was that the car that drove up? Uh, you know, you're looking for them at the door. You're just so excited. What does excitement do? It and and usually it causes you to prepare. Well, I I've got to prepare the room where they're going to be. We're going to buy some extra food. We're going to do things because you get into expectation and other things that come in the way. No, I can't have that appointment. I can't do this because we're having our family is coming or something is happening and and that's the way we get and uh and perhaps you could even get uh you could get, you know, really under pressure uh of of some something else. And but you you get desperate. &gt;&gt; You can get desperate. Expectation can put you into desperation. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; And I want to say as it says in Matthew, but and if that evil servant shall say in his heart, "My lord delayeth his coming," and shall begin to smite his fellow servants, and to eat and drink with the drunken, uh the Lord of that servant shall come in a day when he lookth not for him, and in an hour that he's not aware of. We don't want uh that hour. We don't want that attitude to come upon us in a in an when he's not looking for him. He says, "Well, he delays the coming." And uh we say, "Well, people have been looking for the Lord to come for for centuries." And now here we are. And he and the scripture says, "And he shall cut him aunderder and appoint him his portion with the hypocrites. They shall be there shall be weeping and nashing of teeth." I want to say emphatically that I believe I believe with everything that's in me that there's a people on the earth now that are the antitype of Enoch's type. &gt;&gt; Do you believe that? &gt;&gt; There's a people on the earth now that are walking with God in the faith once delivered to the saints. Amen. &gt;&gt; There's a people on the earth now that have heard the voice of God in another garden &gt;&gt; called Satan's Eden. &gt;&gt; And we've heard his voice in this garden. And we're walking with it. &gt;&gt; As Enoch walked with God, he was walking with the word of God. He was walking with the revelation of God. He was walking in the in the knowledge of the hour that he was in &gt;&gt; and he walked pleasing to God &gt;&gt; in that hour. &gt;&gt; And I want to say to this congregation and all that hear my voice that that that we will not permit Satan to raise up in our mind that it's not possible for us to live a fervent life in this day. It's entirely possible. I reject the spirit of Leodysa with everything that's in me. &gt;&gt; I reject that uh lullabi uh rock rock you to sleep attitude that's not part of us. &gt;&gt; I want this congregation to agree with that. &gt;&gt; So that you say within yourself, I have that same I have that same uh uh conviction &gt;&gt; in my heart today. &gt;&gt; Amen. And it'll do you good to agree with it. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And there are people on the earth today that are living a testimony that is pleasing to God. &gt;&gt; By faith, Enoch was translated, &gt;&gt; that he should not see death, and was f not found because God had translated him. For before his translation, he had this testimony that he pleased God. Brother Brandham describes the scenario that he just walked with God. And he walked with God in such a way that God was so pleased with him, &gt;&gt; he just decided to take him. And if that is the type of a people that's on the earth now, we're either just a people of of another belief or another set of doctrines or another church group or we're a people that are after the same type of of of of Enoch. And if the scripture says that Enoch walked with God, the seventh from Adam, and you know we are the seventh from the second Adam. &gt;&gt; We are the seventh church age from the second Adam, Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. I believe that with all my heart. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He pleased God. That was he be he was acceptable with God. He was well pleasing. And the scripture tells us, having predestinated us, you know what predestinated is? You're predestinated. That's your destination. &gt;&gt; God has determined that this is your destination. &gt;&gt; He predestinated us under the adoption of children by Jesus Christ according to the good pleasure of his will. his will &gt;&gt; to the praise of the glory of his grace wherein &gt;&gt; he hath made &gt;&gt; not you have made he hath made us accepted in the beloved &gt;&gt; I love the dagot &gt;&gt; verse for these verses and the dagot says this where it starts out having predestinated us unto adoption it says having in of &gt;&gt; previously marked us out. Previously marked you out. &gt;&gt; You want to say this morning, I have been previously marked out. &gt;&gt; I'm a marked indeed. I'm marked. &gt;&gt; He's marked us out for sunship. &gt;&gt; He says, "You're going to be a mature son." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And I'm going to cause it to be that way. Amen. &gt;&gt; G &gt;&gt; through Christ Jesus for himself according for the good pleasure of his will to the praise of his glorious uh beneficence uh with which he graciously favored us in the beloved one. I love that having marked having in love previously marked us out. Now, here are some things I want to give you some background so that we can uh move together through this message. Enoch walked with God after he begat Methuselah for 300 years. Methuselah, who almost broke the thousand-year day, he lived the longest. a day is with the Lord as a thousand years. He lived 969 years, but failed to break the thousand-year day. In other words, in the day you eat thereof, you shall surely die. No man was able to break that thousand-year day. Enoch walked with God after he begat Methuselah 300 years. Enoch walked with Adam for possibly 57 years. Adam who saw everything transpire in Eden. Enoch was able to perhaps speak with him and know exactly what took place. that 57 years before Adam died. Enoch prophesied or preached for perhaps I took him at 30 years old. He lived to 365 years. He probably preached prophesied for 335 years before he was translated. Enoch saw the coming of the Lord to execute judgment upon the ungodly. Enoch was the seventh from Adam and we are the seventh church age from the second Adam. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And we read that in Jude 14 and 15. And the prophet said in the rapture message again Enoch was the seventh from Adam which was a type of the church ages. Now, all of the rest of the six men before him died, but Enoch was translated, Enoch was raptured, the seventh, showing that it's the seventh church age that takes the rapture. &gt;&gt; Now, there's no doubt that we're living in the seventh church age. &gt;&gt; In the days of Enoch, the people had their own religion. In questions and answers, a prophet said they had their own religions and they did not believe the message of Noah. They did not believe the message of Enoch. And the type is there are many that can't believe and don't believe the message of this hour. And I would trust that we today are believers. And they rejected their message and was condemned. The Bible said they were &gt;&gt; right. in conflict between God and Satan. Says, "And Enoch, the great prophet who prophesied of the Lord coming was translated raptured before the flood. Noah was carried through to preserve seed on the earth." Noah's father, Lamek, he lived 140 years during Enoch's lifetime. And Lamek may well have told his son uh Noah of his grandfather, Lamech's grandfather, who was translated Lamek's grandfather was Enoch and he could possibly well have told him uh of the young man of 365 years. Now you have to put your mind in a completely different we live 60 70 years 80 years 90 years and oo we're old. Uh Enoch at 365 years he live he died as a very young man or he didn't die he was raptured as a very young man. The one before Enoch was I'm going to show you these in a minute and lived 962 years which was Jared his father and his son lived 969 years and he lived 306. So he lived about a third of an average man's life. So say an average man's life is you know 60 70 years or 75 years and he could have lived about said the word was out Enoch he vanished he was a holy man godly man and God took him &gt;&gt; when he was just a young man &gt;&gt; of 365 years only lived a third of the average man's life. &gt;&gt; You know, it shouldn't really surprise if we think 300 years, 900 years. I thought I thought that you folks are here because of eternal life. &gt;&gt; What's eternal life? &gt;&gt; There's no beginning, no end. &gt;&gt; You're not going to learn to play a harp. That's not it. Not going to sit on a cloud and do some things. That's not what it's all about. There's a a God out there. I was just driving to the church this morning and seeing we passed all the farm fields where they have uh so much of the market gardens growing and all kinds of vegetables and they're probably they've just planted probably the fourth or fifth crop this season. And that ground is so fertile here in this delta. It just grows up. You almost can see it grow up. And they have carrots and vegetables and onions and all kinds of things growing. And then and there'll be on one side of the field there'll be the sorers and on the other side of the field be the reapers on the same field and then all kinds of different different things growing. And I thought, isn't our God? I said to my wife, "Isn't our God something? Just all these different things and some of these vegetables people love and then next person hates it and doesn't want to eat it." And and she said, "Yes, and what about all the taste buds that are in your tongue?" And and I said, "You know, that's just amazing. Our God, he just planted all of this stuff." I said, "Why didn't he just say, listen, you lump of dirt, go out and eat the dirt." Yeah. &gt;&gt; But in the dirt, he he said, "You know, the these people I've made and my children, they're going to need what's in there for their for their bodies, just for their earthly. So, I'll take all the elements of the soil, and I'll bring it up in all different here's blueberries over here, and here's carrots over here, and here's all these wonderful vegetables just growing up, and all the to satisfy all the different taste buds of all the different people." one said, "No, I don't like that." Next one says, "I love it." Isn't it amazing? We sit at the same table. You folks, I I want you to respond like humans now. You know, that's where you live. And and that's exactly the way we are. And just think our heavenly father. And brother Brandham says, "And and then he created thing. One person loves the deserts, and the next person loves the mountains, and one loves the ocean, and one loves the prairies. And it's a good thing we're not all the same. We're not all in the same place. And he says, "And then somebody says, "Oh, no. I'm not interested in the mountains." He said, "You know, God just cleaned off his his uh uh his trowel or his mortar box and and created all the mountains." Well, and he said he did it for me then cuz he liked the mountains. Well, uh we're here and we've got mountains whether we like them or not. They're they're here. So, uh you know, just imagine what he's preparing. Behold, I go and prepare a place for you. And it'll he said it'll be suited just exactly to the bride's liking. Hallelujah. You won't have to worry about being bored over there, friends. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I can just feel the expectation of it coming on. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I thought this might be interesting for you. And this isn't critical, but I'm going to just show you a couple slides. Can I get it here as well? Thank you. Just 10 generations spanned the 1656 years between the day God made Adam and the day Noah entered the ark to ride out the great flood. And because of their longevity, excluding Enoch only, the pre flood members in the in the Adam to Noah line lived an average of 912 years. And one might imagine that many thousands of years passed from the creation to the flood. The first biblical genealogy recorded is in Genesis 5 if you wish to look at it. And I thought that this might be interesting to you. Adam from zero from his creation lived 930 years. Seth 130 from when he was born to 10:42. We go on down Enos, Canaan, Mahal, Lal, Jared, Enoch, Methuselah, Lamek, and Noah. This is what's interesting. Adam lived to see the birth of all of his descendants except Noah. Adam thus saw the terrible fruits of his sinfulness as mankind was just a generation away from destruction when he died. All the pre-noah generations in Adam's bloodline died out before the flood. Methusela died the very year of the flood. &gt;&gt; That's very significant. God would not allow in those generations the direct bloodline of Adam to perish. And Methuselah witnessed his grandson building the ark. Methuselah, the last survivor of the pre-noah generations, he outlived his son Lamech, died the very year in which God sent the flood. Noah's father, Lamech, died just four years before the flood. Noah, having been told by the Lord that only he and his wife and his sons and their wives were to be going into the ark, was probably not terribly distressed at having to bid his father and grandfather farewell before the flood struck. So that's a little background. And the scripture says, Enoch the seventh from Adam prophesied of these, saying, "Behold, the Lord cometh with 10 thousands of his saints." I want to direct your attention now, and if you'll have your Bibles, please turn to the book of Jude. And then when you have found it, it's just before revelation. There are things that perhaps mean something to me and I trust will mean something to you. Even if I can jar your interest. So you say I will look at the message differently. The message is not just a series of books, a series of messages. The prophet says there's not a punctuation out of place in this Bible. &gt;&gt; God put Jude where he wanted the book of Jude. He directed the men and influenced them that the canon of scripture. And there are some, excuse me, that felt, for example, the book of Enoch is not in the Bible. But, and there were other books, the Mcabes and the Catholic Bible, some of them, I think, have the Mcabes books in the Bible. God has ordained that the this Bible does not have those books for whatever reason was known to him. But the book of Enoch, the book of Jude which speaks of Enoch happens to be just below just before the book of Revelation which is really a book of our day. And uh and now this is I think very striking. Brother Brandham takes his text for souls that are in prison now from the book of Jude and also from Peter where he speaks of the uh destruction in the angels which were once in uh that were deceived and were cast down and Jude refers to it. So Enoch walked amongst a people that had corrupted themselves to such a degree &gt;&gt; that God was grieved that he had made man. And the Bible says in Genesis 6 and 11, don't turn to it. I'm going to going to Jude right away. The earth was also corrupt before God and the earth was filled with violence. Do we not have that earth again now? And God looked upon the earth, and behold, it was corrupt, for all flesh had corrupted his way upon the earth. And the Bible says, "And it repented the Lord that he had made man on the earth, and it grieved him to his heart." And the and the if you take the word grieved and it grieved him to his heart, it actually says it angered him. The Bible tells about God could be filled with wrath. And you might think, you wonder about that, say, "Well, I thought God was love." Our problem is we don't understand what love is. &gt;&gt; Love has to have justice associated with it. Otherwise, it's not love. &gt;&gt; Love is corrective. &gt;&gt; And our prophet has said that. And we know that that's true. If we love our children or you have children, if you love them, you'll correct them. You'll direct them. and if necessary chastise them whether it's the law or not the law I don't say beat them I'm just saying chastise them and there's different ways perhaps of doing that but I I am saying that the scripture has the right uh has the right policy has the right direction &gt;&gt; for our lives &gt;&gt; all of our lives and so the Bible says that it was it was uh it grieved him at his heart and the grief was not only to hurt but to be in pain or vexed to torture. God's heart was so grieved and he became angered. Listen, it wasn't. You say, "Well, how does a God of love destroy the earth in a flood? Destroy every living thing." You should read about it. Destroy every living creature in a in a flood. And then they get all into debate. Did it happen? Didn't it happen? How are the mountains? I've talked to people, they said, "Well, how are the mountains covered?" Because there wouldn't be enough water. They don't read or they don't understand the Bible. The Bible says the fountains of the deep were broken up. &gt;&gt; It didn't just rain. &gt;&gt; The fountains of the deep, even science tells us today that there's rivers in the earth which are larger than those that are on the earth. Right. &gt;&gt; I go over to Hawaii and I look at these monster hotels and just thousands and tens of thousands and millions of people that visit and they they run their water taps and they run. I say to my wife, here we are sitting out in the middle of the Pacific and the salt water just every direction for thousands of miles. Where does this water come from? They flush their toilets and they wash their dishes and they have all of this fresh water and there just more fresh water coming. Where does this water come from? They don't chip it here. Comes out of the earth. And yet those earth th those mountains that the Hawaiian islands are sitting on. I've got uh just thousands of miles of water and hundreds if not thousands of feet deep. Where does this water come from? And God has provided it some way. We can't just go along and and put God in some kind of a little box. God, even this even this earth, this planet that we're on today, I'm I'm just marveling. God has to be a God to even find this speck, &gt;&gt; let alone find these specks that are sitted here today. and to be concerned about them. We have to believe that God is concerned about every little bit of his creation. &gt;&gt; And he knew exactly the life you'd live and exactly when you'd be born, exactly when you'd hear his voice. &gt;&gt; And then he would appeal to you. Walk with my voice. Walk with me. You can't walk with God unless you walk with his words. And you walk with his voice. And if you turn away from his words, you turn away from his voice. It's not possible to walk with God and not walk with his word. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Enoch walked his life and lived a testimony. and his life and testimony spoke of the oncoming storms of judgment and the conditions that no doubt became quite normal for him for Enoch and I'm placing ourselves in the same thing became quite normal the perverted life that was being lived till God and he's now he's walking with God he's walking with a revelation of God that is so contrary to what he's experiencing. &gt;&gt; Listen, friends, I've never seen this this way. I've never preached on this this way. But there he's caught between he's walking with God. And yet all the conditions around him are so opposed to God and grieving God to such a degree is that God, his father, the one he's walking with, is saying, "I'm going to destroy this And Enoch said, "I better say something about it." And he preached that God was going to execute judgment. You think he was popular? He was not popular. &gt;&gt; And he was not trying to wing a popular win a popularity contest. He was it it inspired when he heard that and knew that God was grieved. And when he knew the earth was corrupted, it put him in such a state of expectation that one that walks with God surely can't stay here. &gt;&gt; I must be designed for another place because this world is not my home. &gt;&gt; I'm not at home in this c I'm not at home the way I'm not at home friends the way Leo deay is going. &gt;&gt; Are you? No you we're not. We're not at home. Amen. &gt;&gt; We're distressed about it &gt;&gt; and that's good. &gt;&gt; But it doesn't shouldn't put us in a state of despondency. Oh, look at this and look at that. Don't even look at that. Look at the one you're walking with. &gt;&gt; Look at the Holy One of Israel. &gt;&gt; Look at the God who designed redemption. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Look at the God who loved you so much that even took out of his own bosom, sent his son to die of cruel death at Calvary. that we might be saved &gt;&gt; that he wanted to save these little lumps of clay &gt;&gt; and give them eternal life. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And send a part of his own nature character into us. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Listen. Reproach for the word. The prophet speaking, Noah lived. And I've had people maybe question this, but here's here's one that was vindicated. And if we question it, we better have equal or better vindication. &gt;&gt; Do you agree with that? &gt;&gt; Noah lived in a scientific age. Amen. &gt;&gt; Where there was a scientific achievement that they were unable to manufacture uh that we are where there was a scientific achievement that they were able to manufacture that were beyond anything we've manufactured today. They were brighter, more intelligent. Their science was far advanced to ours. And just remember, he had to stand the reproach of the word that he preached 120 years. He was speaking of Noah, of the face of the scoffers. And I'm telling you that these were conditions that Enoch also lived in. &gt;&gt; Their great scientific ways proved to them that there was no rain in the skies. But yet Noah had heard the word of the Lord. How? That's not a none of our business. He had heard the word of the Lord &gt;&gt; and it was contrary to their conception of it. So before his life could be saved, he must stand in the face and bear the reproach that these scoffers reproached him by. &gt;&gt; Jude makes references Now, I hope are are you are you all right for a little bit yet? Jude makes references to the conditions of Enoch's time. Part of the service today is to get your mind turned around just in case you didn't think of the time that your type Enoch lived. &gt;&gt; And when you see him, then you know what you expect. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; When you see what he could do, then you know what you can do. When you saw what he can overcome, then you know that you will overcome it. &gt;&gt; I want you to understand, not only understand that and not go away from here with, you know, just some excitement about it, but to say that he God put him there. His conditions are the same and he overcame it. &gt;&gt; And if he overcame it, that is a perfect sign that I'm going to overcome it. &gt;&gt; And my faith is in the word of God. God put that word there. Are you in agreement with that? He overcame it. I will overcome it. Not because you have a certain uh degree of stamina or a certain determination. It's not your determination. It's God said he made you accepted in the beloved. &gt;&gt; Noah Enoch was accepted. You're accepted. &gt;&gt; Noah Enoch overcame. You overcome. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. So Jude makes references to the conditions of Enoch's time. And now we will turn to Jude's gospel, Jude's epistle. And uh I'm going to start at the third verse, but this been on my heart and it's rather strange. I'm going to have you read with me. I want you to absorb what it is that Jude is saying. And these are the conditions. We'll start with the third verse. Beloved, when I gave all diligence to write unto you of the common salvation, it was needful for me to write unto you and exhort you that you should earnestly contend for the faith which was once delivered unto the saints. You're reading it with me, are you? &gt;&gt; I want you to be reading it with me. Now, uh, notice this verse. I gave all diligence to write unto you of the common salvation. It's the only time it appears like that. The and common salvation is not just a uh it doesn't refer to that of the common people. But the common salvation actually common has a negative uh inference. it it refers to something that's negative, something that's common, something that's unacceptable. But the reason why uh the apostle here or Jude is referred to it as the common salvation, it is the it is a word that encompasses the generality. If you were to say today, how many people believe they're saved? Multitudes. Churches are full of it. All field are saved. How many are born again? Millions born again. And so it's the it's the common it's the salvation in generality. But now these are some of the things. So he's dealing with what is what is involved with the common salvation. And he says, he says, "And when I gave all diligence to write unto you of the common salvation, it was needful for me to write unto you." When he thought of the common salvation, all who experience or feel that they have received salvation. They're under the banner of salvation. He said, "When I thought of that, it was needful that I write unto you and exhort you that you should earnestly contend for the faith." Why is he saying that is because there were those that did not contend for the faith. &gt;&gt; And he goes into he goes into that subject in the rest of these verses. the shortest verse in the Bible. The one that God placed just before Revelation. The one that the pro prophet in this day chose for the message souls that are in prison now. &gt;&gt; That you should earnestly contend for the faith which was once delivered to the saints. in Ephesians the message the Ephesians church age he he he refers to Jude 3:4 and12 and beloved when I gave all diligence to write unto you he takes the same scripture and then brother Brandham says it cannot be denied in the face of these scriptures that the true church and the false church are intertwined having been planted together but of different seeds Now friends, this is not to be this is not a scripture for just a denominational church. In fact is it's not. It's for those that are contending for the faith. It is that you shall know, you are to know and if you don't know, you should know that as the prophet says, it cannot be denied in the face of these scriptures that the true church and the false church are interwined, having been planted together, but of different seeds. &gt;&gt; We need to say amen to that. We need to be in full expectation and realize that we need the Holy Spirit. &gt;&gt; We need to be filled with the Holy Ghost to make discernment between what is true and who is contending for the faith and who's denying the faith. &gt;&gt; Because if you just take the outward, if you just take a an emotional approach, you'll be completely confused because they will look the same. They will say the same things. They will sing the same songs, but they're not of the same seed. &gt;&gt; And don't make a believer responsible for those that don't believe. &gt;&gt; Every man must bear his own burden. &gt;&gt; Every man must bear his own burden. It's not your responsibility what my decisions are. That's me. I'm responsible before God. You're responsible before God. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; I'll smile so you don't know. You don't think I'm angry. I'm not. Verse four. Now, let's just finish with verse three again. That you should earnestly contend for the faith which was once delivered unto the saints. for or because there are certain men crept in unawares, who are before of old, ordained to this condemnation, &gt;&gt; ungodly men turning the grace of our God into lasciviousness and denying the only Lord God and our Lord Jesus Christ. Now, this is a bit of a a bit a bit of a study, but when we say lasciviousness, we think of uncleanness. Gross uncleanness. Let me say to you, there is nothing so grossly unclean as someone having another another gospel. &gt;&gt; That is the adultery of all adulteries &gt;&gt; is to deny the faith. And that's what that's what Jude is speaking about. Friends, I can't say this in in soft terms. I have to say it very very clearly so that you won't have any misunderstanding of what I'm saying. And I'm not speaking of any persons. Have that absolutely firmly in your mind. If anybody even says that, that is absolutely wrong. But if anybody if the shoe fits, then they better wear it. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen. &gt;&gt; If I deny the faith, I want someone to come to me and tell me, you're denying the faith. &gt;&gt; And if someone denies that the prophet of God is a vindicated messenger of this age, I say they are denying the faith [Applause] &gt;&gt; and let them have their they'll be rewarded accordingly. All of us will be rewarded accordingly. I'm taking this gospel very seriously. I take this message very seriously. &gt;&gt; I had I had one of the one of the men that I most respected on earth travel a 10 or 11 hour round trip to sit in my home and tell me that this message was not correct. And I called him by his first name because many of you know of him, led me into the ministry, opened the doors for me, and I said to him, Chad, my wife who was in the kitchen and my children, I have committed to this gospel &gt;&gt; and nothing can change that. Amen. &gt;&gt; And those were our last words. Not our last words to speak about, but our last words to speak on that situation. He knew that nothing could change &gt;&gt; my position on the message of the hour. &gt;&gt; That was the same then, &gt;&gt; maybe 40 years ago, and it's the same today. &gt;&gt; This message I experienced answering confusing questions. This message answered where the world was going and where the religious world was going and a world that hasn't got an understanding of even the godhead &gt;&gt; or baptism which the prophet said shouldn't take a revelation all kinds of confusion and as soon as these the even these authors that come against uh William Bran's message almost every one of them almost every single one the first thing they bring up is the trinity. Yeah. &gt;&gt; Something that doesn't appear in the Bible &gt;&gt; and we use them as some kind of authority &gt;&gt; to oppose the message. I say that is a that is so unreasonable. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Friends, I'm this is part of a testimony this morning. I'm saying this message resolved that question for me forever. I've never had a question about the Godhead from that day to this. Never had a question about baptism. That doesn't even enter my mind. I have such a blessed confidence and such an assurance. Glory to God. Jesus is mine. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; I want you to read now. Listen. Lasciviousness is is want wantedness or shamelessness. And the and the and it gives a further meaning. It says shamelessness, lasciviousness is to also to be shameless or untroubled or unaffected by shame, especially in situations where others would be ashamed. &gt;&gt; Friends, when I read what some people, &gt;&gt; those who've been who've been brought up in the message, I'm not even talking about I'm not even talking about this place. I I there's been those that have been in Arizona, those in Indiana and other parts of the world. This message will have opposition that all all kinds of denominations and churches, they scrap and fight amongst themselves. But it's the amazing thing. The message becomes a real target. &gt;&gt; And it's not those on the outside, but those that have come from within. &gt;&gt; And it has happened. It's been in different parts of the country, different parts of the world, and they raised up now because they they know things from the inside. Listen, I'm going to be very very plain. Judas happened to know where the garden was. &gt;&gt; He happened to know where Jesus resorted thither. &gt;&gt; He knew he The other people didn't know where to go, but he knew where to go. He knew where he would be cuz he had come from the inside. &gt;&gt; He was a treasure. He carried the bag. He knew how things were conducted. &gt;&gt; And he went to his own place &gt;&gt; by his own testimony. I'll tell you what, friends. You say, "Well, we don't want to, you know, we don't want to hurt anybody's feelings." Let me say this. The graveyard is full of people and most of them died as unbelievers and they will go dust to dust and so will this body go dust to dust. But my soul has been redeemed by the word of God. And we only have the promise of God. And it's this God that can vindicate himself, prove himself, show himself as being true and prove his give evidence that he is present. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. So now I want you to read with me. I want to be able to hear your voice. We'll start with the verse five. Verse four ends up only and denying the only Lord God and our Lord Jesus Christ. Verse five we'll read together. I will therefore put you in remembrance, though ye once knew this, how that the Lord having saved the people out of the land of Egypt, afterward destroyed them that believed not. That's verse five. He's dealing with the children of Israel that came out of Egypt. Now two, he goes to the angels which held not their first estate. Verse six. And the angels which kept not their first estate, but left their own habitation, he hath reserved in everlasting chains under darkness under the judgment of the great day. Now he goes to Sodom. Verse 7. Even as Sodom and Gomorrah and the cities about them in like manner, giving themselves over to fornication and going after strange flesh are set forth for an example, suffering the vengeance of eternal fire. Verse 8 will continue. Likewise also these filthy dreamers defile the flesh, despise dominion, and speak evil of dignities. Stop there. How could how could I put in any other category? When I read it, I was filled with shame. Filled with flame shame. It says Malachi 4 5 and 6. Malachi 4. William Brandham did not fulfill this. I tell you that is a shameful statement. &gt;&gt; And that is speaking evil of dignity. Why don't they refer to perhaps I I did a little brief calculation that the the prophet of God stood publicly before nations of the world be it India or Africa or United States or Canada or Finland or Norway and in Europe and Germany and Switzerland and the same angel of the Lord was always present. Oh, they can quibble about this light or that light or whether it was a bulb or whether it was I care not. I care about the light that spoke to the individual and the the light that said to them uh as they said to a woman that I just read this morning and you got a baby. The reason you're weeping is you've got a baby and it's got marks on its face and you don't know and the doctors have told you it is without hope. They can do nothing for you. And he says and some people say it's a birthmark and he he cast out the devil out of that child. and he said it's actually tumorous. &gt;&gt; Something that medical science couldn't prove. But a prophet gives a lady the answer for her child and it's actually tumorous and it'll leave. You tell me that isn't a prophecy. That's a prophecy. And are untold millions around the globe that have come under the blessing of that of that prophetic ministry. Pray for me friends. &gt;&gt; I want to say it very clear to me that's speaking evil of dignities. And I want every person here, don't you even listen to that stuff. Don't you even become affected because in this day of social networking, cast it out in the name of Jesus Christ. I would shut down Facebook. &gt;&gt; I don't belong to it. Never have been. I've been invited to it many times. I don't answer it. I don't join and I and that's not because I'm old-fashioned. I do all my messages on I I research things all the time. I'm in the on the internet and on Google far more than a lot of other people younger than myself, but I don't set myself up with this to be a target for all this other nonsense. I don't want my eyes to read it and I don't want my ears to hear it. And the only time you said, "Well, have you have you heard have you you know what? I haven't even read the whole thing. &gt;&gt; It's too shameful. &gt;&gt; And a bunch of people that are completely nonvindicated on what authority do these things be spoken &gt;&gt; and they cannot duplicate not one of the thousands of times. And I calculated perhaps brother Brandham revealing the secret, God revealing the secret of the heart through him about uh maybe 7,000 times. Can you imagine that? Right from the beginning of his ministry right to the very end of his ministry. &gt;&gt; That's why I want you to read this scripture with me. &gt;&gt; I want you to read I want your lips to say what he said. what Jude said, what God has said in his word and he is speaking about Enoch's time &gt;&gt; and this is our time. You can't say out of one side of your mouth, Enoch is my type. But on the other hand, I live in a different kind of a culture and I live in more accepted. No, you don't. You live in exactly the same condition. &gt;&gt; And while Enoch was living, God was fitting the generation for destruction by water. And he is fitting this generation. This generation is headed for absolute destruction. I even marvel that it still exists. &gt;&gt; When I see the glorification of all of this perverted gra gratification, it's just amazing, friends. It's amazing. You ought to be stirred up in your heart about these things. &gt;&gt; You ought to say, "I I I'm just deeply I I'm shameful for the generation we live in. All right. &gt;&gt; I just hope that you're in agreement. &gt;&gt; I didn't think I was going to come this strong this way, but I just preached, believe it or not. I just let the lights blind me because in the auditorium in North Carolina and Thursday and Friday, I preached not from this subject at all. a completely different subject. But God just took a hold as I feel he is this morning and God was speaking to me earlier said let the people read this themselves. &gt;&gt; This is God's word. &gt;&gt; We either believe it or we don't believe it. And I talked very straight and 4 500 maybe 600 700 people there. The place turned electric. &gt;&gt; And I had ministers come to me after and say you had to say that. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We needed to hear it. And that's a message of this hour. &gt;&gt; And we spoke very forcefully of the conditions of this time. And friends, I'm not going to let people just invade and creep in unawares and we just, you know, go along, you know, call it for what it is. It's a denial of the very gospel that saved me. It's a denial of the very structure that we're founded on. And I don't I resist it in the name of Jesus Christ as a demon spirit. [Applause] &gt;&gt; And friends, you may not know, but I stood in my office and spoke to one of the leaders and said, "This is a demon spirit." And he turned and looked me in the eye. He said, "Are you calling this a devil?" I said, "I am indeed." I said, "Are you calling a work that uh that destroys seeks to destroy the house of God and families and the people of God and tear them one from another? I is that the Holy Ghost?" &gt;&gt; I asked him right in my office &gt;&gt; and there was no voice. There was no words. There was no sound. And I opened the door and allowed the man to leave. Listen friends, we know what the Holy Ghost does. &gt;&gt; We have sense the presence of the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; And I tell you what, even when it comes to sickness, a lot of people aren't delivered from sickness because they say, "Well, you know, I'm depressed or I'm this or I'm call it what it is. It's a devil." And the sooner you call it the devil, the sooner you'll be delivered from it. I'm just not able to walk up to the standard of the of the message. Of course you're able. &gt;&gt; You need to deny it. And the scripture tells us and the prophet is speaking in in souls that are in prison. It's the nature. The the soul is the nature of the life. It was our nature. It was Adam's nature. He lost the God nature. &gt;&gt; And Jesus went to Calvary. And the scripture says in Isaiah 60 uh Isaiah 60 uh 1 6162 there Isaiah 53 I'm sorry says and he poured out his soul &gt;&gt; unto death at Calvary he poured out what you need &gt;&gt; and people say well that's just by nature. No you need to die &gt;&gt; and let that nature die. [Applause] And when that nature rises up and and keeps you uh keeps you distant from the things of God, deny that nature. &gt;&gt; I can't praise God. I'm a quiet person. I would call on every quiet person in this place to give a praise to God and say, "Thank God for deliverance." Hallelujah. I deny that nature because I'm robbing Jesus Christ of his due praise. &gt;&gt; Glory to God. Glory to God. Thank God for Calvary. Thank God for saving me. Amen. [Music] &gt;&gt; And then he goes on verse nine, we'll read together &gt;&gt; all your boys. Verse nine. Yet Michael the Archangel, &gt;&gt; he disputed about the body of Moses, dur not bring against him a railing accusation, but said, "The Lord rebuke thee." Even Michael when contending with Satan, dur not bring an accusation against him when he disputed about the body of Jesus or I'm sorry, the body of Moses. He dares not bring a railing accusation against him, but said the Lord rebuke thee. &gt;&gt; That's the key. &gt;&gt; It's not my rising up or your rising up. It's the Lord that is this is the battle is the Lord's. &gt;&gt; The Lord rebuke thee. He said verse 10. But these speak evil of those things which they know not. Stop. They speak evil. Jude is speaking of conditions that Enoch experienced. &gt;&gt; And then he goes to uh he goes to the children of Israel that came out of Egypt and they spoke evil of things that they knew nothing about. They thought they were just speaking about Moses. I want to reveal something to you. This is a pattern that a lot of people don't know. And listen on the internet and everywhere in archive and wherever it is I'm speaking it for the first time. They speak evil of those things they know not. &gt;&gt; They don't have a full understanding. They don't have a spiritual understanding of it and they speak evil of those things and it always follows the same pattern. First it's it's a individual because it's something that's from the natural. It's a reasoning. So they they find something wrong with an individual. &gt;&gt; They found something wrong with the woman Moses married. &gt;&gt; It was the individual. &gt;&gt; Then it goes from the individual to the preacher. &gt;&gt; It's his problem because he's not handling it right. &gt;&gt; And Moses now it it it advanced to him because he had taken and now a prophet, you need the message. The prophet of God said God told him to take her. &gt;&gt; But it goes from first it's an individual in the church. We've had it many times. It's all you know a certain problem in the church or sometimes it's a problem with an individual. Sometimes it's a problem with that very person's own children, own young person. And then they say, and I I appreciate every family here, but listen to me now. And then and then as Satan gets behind it and then says, "Well, there's something wrong with the preacher because if he was preaching the right thing, then I wouldn't have this problem." So now Satan, he's transferred it from the individual to the minister &gt;&gt; or to the prophet. I'll show you. And they transferred it to Moses. And then they transferred it to God because they said, "Are you the only holy one here?" Now, now it advanced. It wasn't the woman anymore. And these are two different or three different accounts. But advanced from the person to the p to to the minister, then from the minister to his message. &gt;&gt; And when they touched the message, they were touching God. Yeah. &gt;&gt; And that was that spirit's design in the first place. &gt;&gt; So they took what humanly they saw with the human eyes and the human understanding. That shouldn't be that this is wrong, that's wrong, this person, that person. It's an individual. Then it goes from the individual to the preacher &gt;&gt; or the prophet or the servant of God, whoever that servant happens to be in that place. Then it goes, hey, every preacher in the message would say amen to this &gt;&gt; because they've all experienced the same thing. Then it goes just to the minister. I'm not saying the minister don't do wrong. They may well do wrong. But a servant rises or falls before his own master &gt;&gt; and then it goes to the message. Well, if you were dealing with it right, if you understood the message right, or if you understood the message correctly, you'd be doing this, that, or the other thing. And so, they found that with Moses. And then, and then and then it was God. And so, God even had to speak to Moses, step aside. &gt;&gt; I'm going to destroy them. &gt;&gt; And he fell down, showed his his attitude. He fell down the brereech &gt;&gt; to be a type of Christ. &gt;&gt; Said, "Don't take them. if you take them take my name off the book. &gt;&gt; And so God spared them, but said he'd still remember that. &gt;&gt; He'd remember that. &gt;&gt; Now, let I I'll go to I'll go to Samuel. In Samuel's case, we might even if you read it, you might even sympathize with the people because it was the elders. They came to Samuel. I'm only showing you a principle now in the scripture. And they came to Samuel and said, "Your sons are living wicked lives." Which they were. And And your sons are living wicked lives. They're not following God like you do. &gt;&gt; And and so they realize they have a need. And so it was it was the boys in Samuel's case. And then it went to Samuel &gt;&gt; because he hadn't maybe reared them right or whatever was in their mind, but they had come to a conclusion. And the conclusion was there was they wanted to have now a king. Well, a king has a different message than a prophet. &gt;&gt; Are you with me? &gt;&gt; So they had a problem with his message. &gt;&gt; When they had a problem with his message, they were having a problem with God. Right. &gt;&gt; They had not put the connection together. And so Samuel goes to mourning and he mourns over being rejected. And God comes and comforts him and says, "They have not rejected you. They rejected me." &gt;&gt; They don't realize that. Hey, in this generation, friends, &gt;&gt; brother Brandham in the opening of the seals says this what the speaking the seals. He spoke hundreds and hundreds of messages. Now he's speaking se as seven seals messages simplicity and then the breach with it plus questions and answers all in the seals book. He said this will cause 10,000 of my friends to leave me. He knew it ahead of time. &gt;&gt; This will cause 10,000. But did he deter? Did he change course? Did he soften it up? No. He said it like it was. &gt;&gt; So that he could say at the end, it's thus sayaith the Lord. Because there'd be a people like you and I that would need to hear that. And I heard thus sayith the Lord this morning in my chair and I just start to break up. Oh God, thank you. Oh God, thank you. We have thus sayeth the Lord. [Music] &gt;&gt; Take this message seriously, friends, as seriously as I'm taking it. Can I carry on for just a few more minutes? &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Speak evil of those things which they know not. &gt;&gt; But what they know naturally. As brute beasts in those things they corrupt themselves naturally, that is in a manner in a natural manner or by the aid of bodily senses. &gt;&gt; What they know naturally &gt;&gt; that must not dictate to our spiritual life. What we know naturally is what God has revealed to you, spoken to you, and confirmed. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Agree with the word. &gt;&gt; Let's read together from verse 11. Woe unto them for they have gone in the way of Cain and ran greedily after the error of Balum for and perished in the gain sayings of Kora. These are spots in your feasts of charity when they feast with you. Stop please. When they feast with you. This is not some distant thing. This is thing that crept in unawares and can feast with you. &gt;&gt; Take communion with you. &gt;&gt; Wash feet with you. &gt;&gt; This is what you have to be aware of. &gt;&gt; Feeding themselves without fear. Clouds they are without water, carried about of winds. Trees whose fruit witherth without fruit, twice dead, plucked up by the roots, raging waves of the sea, foaming out their own shame, wandering stars to whom is reserved the blackness of darkness forever. And Enoch also, the seventh from Adam, prophesied of these. Stop. Prophesied of these. our type prophesied of these. &gt;&gt; Hello. &gt;&gt; What is your life testifying about? Your life's a prophecy that these things exist. &gt;&gt; And so when you see it, say, "Oh, all caught up." Don't glorify it. Oh, you hear what this person saying, "Here, this person wrote a book or whatever and more." One of the big books that's out just now which maybe some of this material come from was denied this message when we were still in the house and he's an engineer lives here lives in this lower mainland area I met him in fact walking on the prominad in clover in in white rock happened to meet him here some months ago and he looked at me and he said, "I need to speak with you." &gt;&gt; I said, "Yes." He said one of the happiest moment in fact is I think he said the happiest moment, most wonderful moment of his life was when he met us. Said that then he said, "I need to speak with you." I said, "Yeah." He said, 'I can prove to you that the serpent seedy doctrine is wrong.' I said, 'Really, we're on the prominad and young ladies, they're prominading back and forth in their short shorts and whatever more and everybody, you know what it is down in White Rock. We try to go there early in the morning before they feel comfortable stripped down like that. It's a shame, &gt;&gt; but it's there. It's they're the ones going to answer for it. &gt;&gt; And so I said, "Is that so? You're going to prove to me." I said, "What do you call all this walking down here?" Uh, he opened his mouth to say something. I said, "Are are you going to call it God's seed? &gt;&gt; Why don't you say that? It's God's seed." No, he couldn't say it. I said, "Serpent seed." Don't try to tell me about the doctrine you have when I got the evidence right in front of my eyes &gt;&gt; naturally &gt;&gt; trying to figure things out naturally &gt;&gt; coming against a vindicated mind a vindication of almighty God with a human mind. Hear me friends. This is a this is a condition of this day &gt;&gt; when people are lifted up in their human minds and can explain this and explain that. I don't even give it the time of the day. &gt;&gt; I gave that man just a few minutes have never seen him since. &gt;&gt; I'm not interested in what people's arguments are. And you know one thing, listen to me now. One thing I'm talking about an old warhorse now. One thing I have learned, they never come up with a better vindication. &gt;&gt; They never come up and say, then I tell them, "Well, just say this is of the devil." Oh, no. They're Christians. Well, what are you saying? How can you be Christians and you have to be born of the spirit of God to be a Christian? &gt;&gt; No, they're born of the spirit of God, but they're false. &gt;&gt; Oh, give me a break. This thing is this thing is weaker or thinner than as brother Brandham says. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; You try to live on something that's boil your eggs and think you have soup. And Enoch also for verse 14, the seventh, the the seventh from Adam prophesied of these. And this is what he said. Behold, the Lord cometh with 10 thousands of his saints. Read verse 15 with me. to execute judgment upon all, and to convince all that are ungodly among them, of all their ungodly deeds, which they have ungodly committed, and of all their hard speeches which ungodly sinners have spoken of them. And I want to get stop there for a moment. To convince all, it says execute judgment. and to convince all that are ungodly. That is that they they were in want of reverence towards God. They didn't respect God. &gt;&gt; And that's why he had to preach against their their their their condition and he called it ungodly among them. And they're hard speeches. They're hard speeches. Harsh, offensive, intolerable. And these are murmurers, complainers, walking after their own lusts, and their own mouth speaketh great swelling words, having men's persons in admiration, admiration, admiration, because of advantage. But beloved, remember ye the words which were spoken uh before of the apostles of our Lord Jesus Christ, how that he told you there should be mockers in the last time, who should walk after their own ungodly lusts. These be they who separate themselves sensual, having not the spirit. But ye beloved, building up yourselves in the most holy faith, praying in the Holy Ghost, keep yourselves in the love of God, looking for the mercy of our Lord Jesus Christ unto eternal life and and of some having compassion, making a difference, and others save with fear, pulling them out of the fire, hating even the garment spotted by the flesh. Now unto him that is able to keep you, I say this in the name of Jesus Christ, unto him that is able to keep you from falling and to present you faultless before the presence of his glory with exceeding joy. To the only wise God our savior be glory and majesty, dominion and power both now and forever. Amen and amen and amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; And let me say this in closing. Don't anybody even dare to say that brother Biscoll was placing certain people or certain situation here. I've let that thing go so long ago it isn't funny. &gt;&gt; But when I have good believers, &gt;&gt; honest people speak and call. I I let brother Billy Paul Brandham know where I stood here about a week ago and I thought you know what I said to him if anyone calls you and let you know cuz people somehow I it it it just it came to me and I got a call yesterday did are we the ones that started believe the sign? I said I'm going to make this clear. I said just have them listen to Sunday morning service. I'm going to make an announcement. We have nothing to do with that. But I want to say one thing, friends. Those things whether it's here, I've heard of it. Oh, it's over here and it's over there and it many years ago and all the rest of it. It's time to address it. &gt;&gt; It's time to let you know. You need to know where I stand. &gt;&gt; You need to know what the message says &gt;&gt; and you need to know where you stand. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Is that all right? Amen. &gt;&gt; You need to have a foundation. And you go home and read the book of Jude and it's amazing. The prophet of God uses that to take his text and it and it's amazing that it's just before Revelation, the book of Revelation, the revelation of Jesus Christ. This is the ministry of Malachi 4 to turn the hearts of the children back to the original faith of the fathers. Amen. &gt;&gt; That's the whole ministry. &gt;&gt; And some spirit rise up. I will not stand still &gt;&gt; and not go to battle against that spirit and let you know that it's not persons. It's not individuals. I pray for their salvation. I pray that God may have mercy. But I can tell you when they go that far, &gt;&gt; it's on very dangerous ground. &gt;&gt; And I would not compromise with it. I would be I would be uh uh I would be moving away from my responsibility if I didn't say to you and you see that stuff. My advice to you and counsel to you and sound counsel is forget it. &gt;&gt; Turn aside from it. &gt;&gt; The computer can be a wonderful thing, but it can be a very destructive thing. &gt;&gt; And there are things you see and read and you wish you never saw. And I can tell you, you'll make it without having all read all that. You don't have to go into it. And don't spread it around the country. &gt;&gt; Believers don't need to hear it. &gt;&gt; I don't need to hear it. &gt;&gt; And I don't I just don't read it. &gt;&gt; I don't read it. &gt;&gt; Amen. And it bugs them that I don't read it. &gt;&gt; Because they think, you know, Satan, he wants to have attention. Well, you got to hear this. No, I don't have to hear that. I know where you're headed. &gt;&gt; You know where you're headed, Satan. You're going to the flames of hell. And I'm going to be standing on the on the balcony watching you go. &gt;&gt; Because the scripture says that it talks about the destruction. It says to the people of God, "Yeah, we worship God." And we say, "Hallelujah." &gt;&gt; You're not there yet. &gt;&gt; The book of Revelation says when you see the destruction of the wicked, you're going to say, "Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; We're done with it." Amen. &gt;&gt; The tempter, the accuser, the brethren. He's cast out. &gt;&gt; Glory to God. And that's where we are to live. &gt;&gt; Thank you for your time and for your patience. &gt;&gt; Brother Ryan, do we have a song you can come and sing? Isn't he wonderful? Hallelujah. Let's just stand a moment with your head bowed. I want to thank God for your u patience and being so attentive. May be someone here even in this very unlikely type of service that you're seeing and you're feeling and sensing that God is speaking to you and you are seeing and coming to know and understand things that maybe something was said that is going to guide and direct your life and you you want to say now Lord help me &gt;&gt; help me &gt;&gt; come to me Lord Jesus and he'll come he'll will come right now. I want you to believe that he'll come right now. He'll come right where you are. &gt;&gt; And he knows what spoke to your heart. He sent it for you. &gt;&gt; And if you're one of those, you can just raise open your heart, &gt;&gt; lift your cup upwards, raise your hand if you wish to. None of those things will do it, but the condition of your heart. And I want every believer to believe and pray with me. Father, we pray for this congregation, especially for needy ones that may be standing amongst us at this time and their heart is saying, "Lord, help me. Help me. I need you right at this time." I pray, Father, if there's any that are bound, that you will bring a deliverance to them. That you will cause the chains to be broken and that you will cause the hearts that have not rejoiced to rejoice. I pray, Father, in the name of Jesus Christ, you'll accept my thanksgiving for the wonderful group of people that are here and those that are streaming and some that have even contacted me this morning and said, "I will be streaming. I can't be at the service. I'm far away, but I will be streaming the service." Bless everyone, oh God, who was with us in the meeting. And I pray that the Holy Ghost will go and give understanding in every situation. Oh, Father, we're here. We are we are the antitype of Enoch. We see the oncoming storms of judgment. God, you sent an escape for us and we've accepted that escape in the name of Jesus Christ. You send us a message. Oh God, we're walking with the word. I'm walking with the word. I'm walking with it. Say, I'm writing on it. I'm writing on it. Oh, we bless your name. We bless your name. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Let the people of the Lord say, "Praise God." Let's give him worship and thanksgiving. Oh, we thank you for your provision, oh God. Thank you for your provision. Blessed be your name, Lord. Thank you for your instruction. Thank you for earnest parts. Let us be those that will earnestly contend for the faith in this day and be unmoved in the name of Jesus Christ for your glory. For your glory, for your glory, for your glory, &gt;&gt; glory. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Father. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And we say God, we bless this. We bless thy name.

We have It's not We're afraid, &gt;&gt; but we have fear &gt;&gt; to the And we have reverence to the truth of God's word. &gt;&gt; Friends, don't be caught up. This fine society that you and I are living in, especially for you young people say, "Well, we got a lot of promise." Your best promise &gt;&gt; is not a car or a good job or a better education. Your best promise is that you have eternal life because the holy God of Israel will surely destroy this world and all of the systems of the world. And we don't want to be part of that destruction whatsoever. &gt;&gt; You want to say, "I shall not be part of the tribulation." &gt;&gt; Amen. You want to say that to yourself this morning after hearing this service? I will not be part of the tribulation. I don't need to be a part of the tribulation. I'm here under the sound of God's word. [Music] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. [Music] &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Glory to God. [Music] I'm giving that to you as a commission. You'll meet people that I don't meet. Don't be soft on the issue. &gt;&gt; Save others by fear. Live a godly life. &gt;&gt; Live a Enoch life. &gt;&gt; And this thing I felt so urgent upon me. Don't be weary now. I'm just taking a couple minutes less. I felt so urgent upon me that I should convey to you that the things that come your way, I've heard so many things come my way and and little texts, whatever more and and and and people start feeling down and depressed. Click your heels. &gt;&gt; Jump for joy. This is what the scripture talks about. What do we hear? You hear the scripture. You hear the message, you It's a time for you to rejoice. &gt;&gt; We don't rejoice in it. You don't see Noah going along and rejoicing in the destruction of the of the wicked. God doesn't take pleasure in the destruction of the wicked. Not a bit, but we save all that we can. But we You'll never save them by waffling on the message. &gt;&gt; You need to know the message. Some of you young people that maybe don't have Bibles and you don't bring your Bible here. You get a Bible. You buy a Bible. Get your parents to get you a Bible and come to church with your Bible. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And you hear the message. &gt;&gt; I tell you what, friends, if I if I heard, listen, this place is going to be destroyed. This country is going to be destroyed. And we got a we got an exit route and all you have to do is follow these instructions. I tell you what, we'd be studying them. Oh, this is my way out. &gt;&gt; This message, this word of God revealed is your way out. [Applause] &gt;&gt; Let's be diligent with it. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Oh, my brother. Oh my loving brother. When the world's on fire, don't you want God's bosom to be your pillow? When the world's on fire. Oh, don't you want to God? Yes, I do.

[Music] I tell you what friends, a lot of things in this life aren't very certain, but destruction is certain. It's a spirit that Enoch's expectation which is driving me this morning. On one side, I got great faith. It's letting me know that the rapture time and the change, the power is here to change his body. lets me also know that I must pull others from the fire. &gt;&gt; Don't let the spirit of this age don't coast along you. I can't coast along into eternal life. We are here to fight the good fight of faith &gt;&gt; and to contend. Contend. Contend is an action word. to contend for the faith that was once delivered for the saints. Don't feel hard against me. That's what I'm doing this morning to do everything in my power. Do everything within under the sound of my voice to have the people contend for the faith. We're not contending for any other contention. We're contending for the faith. Amen. &gt;&gt; Oh my loving brother and sister, when the world's on fire. &gt;&gt; Oh, don't you want God's &gt;&gt; to be your pillow? &gt;&gt; I'm sure you do. I be over in the rock of age of rock of age for me. &gt;&gt; I say God bless all that are at the camp. Father Derek and the saints and the believers that are there. God bless those that couldn't be here. God bless those of our loved ones that we've claimed that are not here in the service. &gt;&gt; Have no fear, friends. &gt;&gt; God knows them that are his. &gt;&gt; I say it again. God knows them that are his. [Music] &gt;&gt; You hold them there in faith. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. I can't find exactly this quote, but I remember reading it. Someone was asking, "Brother Brandon about a loved one, and I believe it was actually a partner, husband and wife or wife and husband." and we're praying and and I get I'm so astounded at the at the way the prophet will take just a few words and reduce the very fundamentals of God in a few lines and he said this he said if you pray and you do not doubt &gt;&gt; even if you don't see the answer in your life &gt;&gt; when you rise is in the resurrection. God who cannot lie will have to answer to that faith. &gt;&gt; Isn't that wonderful, friends? Isn't that wonderful? God who cannot lie must answer to that faith. It'll be just as fresh as when the day you went to sleep. Oh, bless his name. I'm trying to close the service, but it's so hard. So hard. One of these days there'll be no time and there won't be won't have to worry about that. We'll be on the other side and we're going to sit around the table, friends. We're going to sit around the supper table and you're going to be just every bit of the person that you are right now, but you'll be in another body. &gt;&gt; Don't you want to be there? &gt;&gt; Don't you want to go to heaven? &gt;&gt; Of course you do. Father, [Music] do what is most pleasing to you in the latter moments of this gathering right now. Don't let anyone that needs to make a decision, don't let them go out without making the decision say, "I've come to the place. I'm done with the world and I'm done with these doubts and I'm done with all of these reasonings and I just give myself completely. Bless this precious people, Lord, that have so attentively listened. We've worshiped together. I said to your spirit, Lord, you have the answer for every question that's in our minds. And father, if anything was said that I said that is not something that you would care and vindicate or care to have said, then I'll ask you to forgive me, Father. But if it is if it is truth and it is something you would punctuate, let it blaze like a brand of fire in the hearts of the people. Oh God, bless your children, I pray, as they spend the rest of the day in your presence, I believe, and I trust so in Jesus Christ's name. Amen. Amen. Amen. Oh, come and go with me to my father's house. Yes. Yeah. Come and go with me to my father's house. Come and go with me to my father's house. &gt;&gt; Let's shake hands with one another.
