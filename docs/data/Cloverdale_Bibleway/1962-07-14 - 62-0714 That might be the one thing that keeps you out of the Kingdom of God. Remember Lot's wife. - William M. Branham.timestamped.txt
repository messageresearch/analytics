[0:00] anything that's uncertain cannot be
[0:03] trusted if there's a question don't do
[0:06] it at
[0:08] all a lady come to me not long ago a
[0:11] woman out my own church young little
[0:14] girl and she said to me they got some
[0:16] kind of fashion out about girls wearing
[0:18] sandal skirts or something had showed
[0:21] the little piece up cut up like this
[0:22] that wore a showed their underneath
[0:24] skirt and she said brother vam do you
[0:26] think it's wrong for us Christian girls
[0:28] to wear Scandal skirt
[0:30] I said why you ask me that part she said
[0:33] I was just wondering I said if it's
[0:34] question your mind don't do
[0:36] it I said if it's question leave it
[0:38] alone you can't be certain dress the way
[0:41] you know you're certain don't take any
[0:44] chance I said by the way what would a I
[0:46] said what what is a scandal sir I didn't
[0:48] know what she was talking about and she
[0:50] told me what it was and I said what in
[0:52] the world would a Christian girl want to
[0:53] show undt I can't understand see that's
[0:57] I just can't get that in my mind don't
[0:59] make sense to me
[1:00] Christ is our life amen all right now
[1:05] but if there's a question man come say
[1:07] you think it's wrong to smoke what are
[1:09] you asking about it for if he
[1:10] questioning your mind leave alone or
[1:13] anything you don't do by faith is
[1:15] sin right got to be a faithful how can
[1:19] you smoke and have
[1:20] faith see right your own conscience
[1:23] shows you that your
[1:24] wrong so if it's uncertain you better
[1:27] leave it alone cuz that might be the one
[1:29] thing keep you out of the kingdom of God
[1:32] oh you say brother B one little thing
[1:34] like that one little thing like that
[1:35] will do it just disobeying one
[1:38] commandment of God one little
[1:41] disobedient one commandment caused all
[1:43] sickness look Jesus said in his own text
[1:46] in his sermon remember lock
[1:49] wife now she had a lot
[1:52] more uh
[1:55] excuse than what we have today doing the
[1:57] things that we do that 's children and
[2:00] grandchildren was burning up in the
[2:02] fires of Hell set down from God and the
[2:06] poor things screaming and crying going
[2:07] up there and she merely turned to look
[2:09] back and she turned to a pillar of salt
[2:11] and stand very at
[2:13] today and Jesus said remember lost wife
[2:17] is got to keep every word of
[2:20] God just one little thing that's the
[2:23] reason sometimes people think I I I get
[2:26] rough with people ball and I it's not
[2:28] because I don't rough it's because I do
[2:31] but in the days of the voice of the
[2:32] seventh angel when he shall begin to
[2:34] sound the mystery of God should be
[2:37] finished as he hath declared to his
[2:39] servants the prophets
