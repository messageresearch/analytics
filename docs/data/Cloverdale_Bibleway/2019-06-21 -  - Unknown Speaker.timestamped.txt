[0:00] and hearing all the sounds of the
[0:01] atmosphere and even in worship and they
[0:03] be able to to hear these things and
[0:05] that's why it's incredibly blessed to be
[0:07] able to hear I'm gonna do something a
[0:10] little unorthodox and have a little
[0:13] video clip and I pray the intent of it
[0:15] comes across and then we'll we'll go
[0:18] forward the service but just a couple
[0:20] minutes long
[0:21] well pray yeah we'll just play that way
[0:25] and you just let me know if everything
[0:27] sounds oh okay five four three two one
[0:35] [Music]
[0:47] [Music]
[0:54] [Music]
[1:04] [Music]
[1:11] let's have a wine is for high okay
[1:14] everything's gonna sound a little
[1:16] strange
[1:18] alright so let's have a LAN you say hi
[1:24] [Music]
[1:28] happy for you so it's gonna take some
[1:40] time to have a little bit more alright
[1:42] how does it sound now good is it
[1:45] sounding better can you hear my voice
[1:47] down
[1:48] yeah can you hear my voice yes
[1:53] [Laughter]
[2:06] [Music]
[2:16] [Music]
[2:31] I'm technically your device is on here
[2:44] you can put it down for a second
[2:46] just used to say only
[3:04] can you hear me and you hear your voice
[3:11] hearing for the first time hey I've
[3:16] watched it many times and it's hard to
[3:20] watch that' without breaking down a
[3:23] little bit because it's such a touching
[3:25] moment when someone is actually heard
[3:27] for the very first time i want you now
[3:33] to still hold that naturally and let's
[3:37] just swing that over on a spiritual side
[3:39] how much more incredible it is when
[3:42] someone can hear spiritually for the
[3:45] very first time amen let's just hold
[3:48] that thought as we go through this
[3:49] service because here the science has
[3:51] gone through so much to try and implant
[3:53] and put different instruments in the
[3:54] inside the skull and connect different
[3:56] things to conduct the nerd day
[3:57] electricity to the brain man has gone
[3:59] through much work and cost one on their
[4:02] cost $30,000 for one year but they felt
[4:05] but their family members helped and
[4:07] pitched in to certain things to do that
[4:09] because it was so important to them just
[4:12] for the natural hearing all the labor is
[4:14] just now imagine just for the 10,000
[4:16] world value of his soul that goes in so
[4:19] that someone can start to spiritually
[4:21] hear God coming through tech Kenny here
[4:23] uh-huh again again I can hear in the
[4:28] elation in the person's face of actually
[4:30] hearing sound you know what's actually
[4:32] just fuzzy for the first time as this
[4:34] started takes time to hear so don't
[4:36] don't be sometimes it takes a little
[4:38] time for somebody start hearing God's
[4:40] voice because it's kind of way out there
[4:41] maybe and it's trying to penetrate
[4:42] through everything amen the power of you
