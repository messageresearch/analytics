[1:11:23] son the greatest
[1:11:27] gift GI known to
[1:11:29] [Music]
[1:11:31] man likewise may you be God's gift to

[1:12:00] you God's
[1:12:03] Prophet seventh angel
[1:12:07] messenger God's voice to us in this
[1:12:12] age malakiah 45
[1:12:16] and6 it reads like
[1:12:18] this behold I will send you Elijah the
[1:12:21] prophet before the coming of the Great
[1:12:25] Dreadful day of the
[1:12:27] [Music]
[1:12:35] Lord and he shall turn the hearts of the
[1:12:38] fathers to the children and the hearts
[1:12:40] of the children to the to their fathers
[1:12:43] lest I come and smite the Earth with a
[1:12:47] curse
[1:12:55] the Bible here tells us if he wouldn't
[1:12:56] send Elijah that he would Smite the
[1:12:58] Earth with a
[1:13:05] curse but thank God he sent
[1:13:13] Elijah Luke
[1:13:16] 17:30 Revelations
[1:13:19] 10:7 and is my honor and my privilege to
[1:13:22] introduce to you
[1:13:25] the speaker for
[1:13:28] today is God's Prophet for our
[1:13:32] time William Mar and Bram William Mar
[1:13:36] and Bram I believe the this speaker that
[1:13:39] we're have today the last speaker for
[1:13:41] this
[1:13:42] [Music]
[1:13:46] year I believe with all my heart he is
[1:13:48] the greatest
[1:13:51] speaker we've had all year
[1:13:55] I I'm not making any less the other
[1:13:58] brothers but this is the greatest
[1:14:00] speaker known to
[1:14:02] us he said he said I am God's
[1:14:07] mouthpiece to this
[1:14:10] generation I leave you with Brother
[1:14:12] Bram the message why it had to be
[1:14:20] Shepherds preached by William Ari and
[1:14:23] brandham brember 1st
[1:14:28] 1964 may the Lord richly bless you
[1:14:33] today I guess kind of a long winded uh
[1:14:37] preacher and without education I I guess
[1:14:41] I don't sound much like a preacher to
[1:14:43] some people and I I don't even claim to
[1:14:45] be a preacher I just kind of a spare
[1:14:48] tire but I feel that I have a message
[1:14:53] from God that in
[1:14:56] my way that only way I had to present it
[1:15:00] I'm trying to present it to the world
[1:15:03] and if I didn't stay with that message
[1:15:06] I'd be a traitor to God and a hypocrite
[1:15:09] to you a person that will say one thing
[1:15:12] and believe another it's
[1:15:15] hypocrisy we must always speak the truth
[1:15:18] from our heart that when people look
[1:15:20] upon us even though they disagree with
[1:15:22] us we want to be hon men and women that
[1:15:26] we speak from our heart that which is
[1:15:28] true in our
[1:15:31] hearts last year or year before last I
[1:15:35] had the privilege of speaking a a
[1:15:37] Christian or pardon me a Christmas
[1:15:40] message here at the
[1:15:43] Remar and I believe I spoke on the
[1:15:46] subject they here our Phoenix on a why
[1:15:50] little
[1:15:52] Bethlehem and I believe then it was sure
[1:15:55] last year I spoke on we have seen his
[1:15:57] star in the east and have come to
[1:16:00] worship
[1:16:01] him and you know we you read the Bible
[1:16:04] and we wonder those
[1:16:07] wi and tonight I thought if you would
[1:16:11] bear with me a
[1:16:12] while and pray with me I would try to
[1:16:16] give you my Christmas
[1:16:19] message God only knows where we'll be
[1:16:21] next Christmas if there is a next
[1:16:24] Christmas after this so being that this
[1:16:27] might be the last Christmas we sit
[1:16:30] together until we sit at another table
[1:16:34] it will not be one of this type but it
[1:16:38] will be when we eat and drink the
[1:16:42] communion a new with him in the father's
[1:16:44] Kingdom at the end of the
[1:16:47] road and then let us approach it tonight
[1:16:51] as if this was the last Christmas me
[1:16:54] message we'd ever set together in in the
[1:16:58] deepness of
[1:17:00] sincerity I want to speak tonight on an
[1:17:02] unusual subject but sometimes you find
[1:17:07] God in the unusual things he does things
[1:17:11] in an unusual way not the usual way it's
[1:17:14] the unusual way unusual times unusual
[1:17:18] seems he
[1:17:22] unusual and I want this Lord willing on
[1:17:24] to speak on the subject of
[1:17:28] why it had to be
[1:17:32] Shepherd and now just before we approach
[1:17:35] the word which I believe that is
[1:17:39] God in the beginning was the word and
[1:17:43] the Word was with God and the Word was
[1:17:46] God and the Word was made flesh and
[1:17:48] dwelt Among Us I said last week a week
[1:17:52] before last at Phoenix it's proven that
[1:17:56] there is subjects of this Earth
[1:18:00] people passing through this building
[1:18:03] now television proves that it's in
[1:18:06] another dimension our natural eyes and
[1:18:09] our five senses cannot pick that up it
[1:18:12] isn't that television manufactures
[1:18:15] anything it only channels you cannot
[1:18:18] make a move with your finger you cannot
[1:18:20] bat your eye but it's proven to be
[1:18:24] recorded
[1:18:26] forever I might be standing or a man in
[1:18:29] Australia would have a a television
[1:18:32] screen here not only that but the the
[1:18:35] man could speak move his finger bat his
[1:18:38] eye or even the color clothing that he's
[1:18:41] wearing would be projected here on the
[1:18:45] wall and he in Africa Australia around
[1:18:48] the world see there is a cycle of ether
[1:18:52] waves I cannot explain it but I know
[1:18:54] it's there I don't think anyone could
[1:18:56] really explain
[1:18:57] it so this television can pull this in
[1:19:02] and make it a reality by some
[1:19:04] instruments that they can reflect it on
[1:19:06] the wall now that same thing was here
[1:19:09] when Adam was here television was here
[1:19:13] when when Elijah sat on Mount Carmel it
[1:19:17] was here when Martin Luther that young
[1:19:19] priest soow the communion on the floor
[1:19:21] and said it's kosha and the just shall
[1:19:24] live of faith it was share then but we
[1:19:27] are just now finding
[1:19:30] it and it's also so that in our presence
[1:19:35] tonight is God angels supernatural
[1:19:40] beings that's unseen to our natural
[1:19:44] sense of sight but someday it'll be a
[1:19:47] reality just as television is now and
[1:19:49] just as
[1:19:51] common now that's why I believe the
[1:19:56] word Jesus said whosoever shall add one
[1:19:59] word to this Bible or take one word out
[1:20:02] of it his part will be taken out of the
[1:20:05] book of
[1:20:06] life so let us bow our heads then before
[1:20:09] we even read
[1:20:11] it so
[1:20:13] solemn any man that's got physical
[1:20:16] strength could turn back the page but
[1:20:18] only God can reveal and with our heads
[1:20:23] bowed now towards the dust from which we
[1:20:25] were
[1:20:26] taken and someday shall
[1:20:29] return I wondering in this solemn moment
[1:20:33] as we're approaching
[1:20:34] Christmas if there is some here that
[1:20:37] really feel
[1:20:40] unworthy and would like to be remembered
[1:20:42] in this prayer would you with without
[1:20:45] raising your head just raise your hands
[1:20:48] to God and say Remember Me Lord this
[1:20:50] Christmas God bless you
[1:20:55] most holy and gracious heavenly
[1:20:59] father almighty
[1:21:02] God he that was from the beginning
[1:21:06] before there was a star or a atom or a
[1:21:11] molecule you made all things by Jesus
[1:21:15] Christ your son and has given us all
[1:21:18] things freely in him we thank thee
[1:21:22] tonight Lord for this opportunity that
[1:21:26] you have given us to assemble ourselves
[1:21:28] together to be
[1:21:31] warned and taught by the Holy
[1:21:35] Spirit and the Holy Spirit takes your
[1:21:39] words and reveals them to
[1:21:42] us for Jesus said when he the spirit of
[1:21:46] Truth has come he will remind you of
[1:21:49] these things that I have said and also
[1:21:52] show you things to come
[1:21:55] God there is not one in our
[1:21:58] midst neither is there one upon the
[1:22:00] Earth who is worthy to try to interpret
[1:22:03] your word for it is written that the
[1:22:06] word of God is of no private
[1:22:11] interpretation therefore Lord we pray
[1:22:13] that the holy spirit will give to us
[1:22:15] tonight each and every one the potion
[1:22:19] that we need to satisfy that hunger
[1:22:23] that's in our heart heart for a closer
[1:22:26] walk with thee we are unfit unclean
[1:22:33] unworthy let the child that was born in
[1:22:36] Bethlehem that lived the most perfect
[1:22:39] life and was the only perfect man up on
[1:22:43] the earth and gave himself a ransom that
[1:22:46] he might cleanse us
[1:22:50] unclean Sinners and to bring us into
[1:22:53] relationship with the
[1:22:55] father Grant tonight that his holy
[1:22:58] spirit through the preaching of the word

[1:23:54] different fashions that the commercial
[1:23:56] world has capitalized on may it be laid
[1:23:59] aside
[1:24:01] God let us enter into
[1:24:05] Christ the
[1:24:08] word for we asked it in his name and for
[1:24:11] his glory
[1:24:15] amen if you will turn with me for a
[1:24:18] reading in the Holy RIT St Luke the 2
[1:24:23] chapter can you hear me all right is
[1:24:26] there any transposition in the
[1:24:28] microphones can you hear me in the back
[1:24:29] all right if you can raise your hand
[1:24:31] thank you the second chapter of The
[1:24:34] Gospel According to St Luke and it came
[1:24:37] to pass in those days that there went
[1:24:39] out a decree from Caesar austa that all
[1:24:43] the world should be
[1:24:46] taxed and this tax was first made known
[1:24:50] it was governor of Syria and all went to
[1:24:54] be taxed every one to his own country
[1:24:57] and Joseph also went up From Galilee
[1:25:00] into the city of Nazareth into Judea the
[1:25:04] city of David which is called Bethlehem
[1:25:07] because he was of the house and lineage
[1:25:11] of David to be taxed with Mary his
[1:25:14] spouse wife being great with
[1:25:17] child and so it was that while she was
[1:25:21] there the days of her accomplishment
[1:25:24] that she should be delivered and she
[1:25:26] brought forth her firstborn son and
[1:25:29] wrapped him in swaddling clothes and
[1:25:32] laid him in the manger because there was
[1:25:35] no room for them in the end and there
[1:25:39] was in the same country Shepherd abiding
[1:25:43] in the fields keeping watch over their
[1:25:46] flocks By Night Lo the angel of the Lord
[1:25:50] Came Upon them and the glory of the Lord
[1:25:53] shone round about them and they were
[1:25:56] sore
[1:25:58] afraid and the angels said unto them
[1:26:02] fear not for behold I bring Good Tidings
[1:26:06] of great joy which shall be to all
[1:26:11] people for unto you is Born This Day in
[1:26:14] the city of David a savior which is
[1:26:17] Christ the
[1:26:18] lord and this shall be a sign unto you
[1:26:22] you shall find the Babe wrapped in
[1:26:24] wadling clothes laying in a manger and
[1:26:28] suddenly there was yeah and suddenly
[1:26:33] there with the angel a multitude of
[1:26:36] heavenly hosts praising God and saying
[1:26:38] glory to God in the highest and on Earth
[1:26:41] peace good well toward man and it came
[1:26:44] to pass as the Angels were gone away
[1:26:48] from them into heaven the Shepherds said
[1:26:51] one to another let us go now even even
[1:26:54] unto Bethlehem and see this thing which
[1:26:56] has come to pass which the Lord has made
[1:26:59] known unto
[1:27:00] us and they came in haste and found Mary
[1:27:04] and Joseph and the Babe lying in the
[1:27:07] manger and when they had seen it they
[1:27:11] made known abroad the saying which was
[1:27:13] told them concerning the child and all
[1:27:17] they that heard it wondered at those
[1:27:20] things which were told them by the
[1:27:22] Shepherds
[1:27:24] but Mary kept all these things and
[1:27:27] pounded them in her
[1:27:28] heart and the Shepherds returned
[1:27:31] glorifying and praising God for all the
[1:27:34] things which they had heard and seen as
[1:27:38] it was told unto
[1:27:41] them may the Lord add His blessings to
[1:27:44] the reading of his
[1:27:46] word
[1:27:49] now it's uh
[1:27:51] why this great even event was revealed
[1:27:56] to
[1:27:57] Shepherds that would be kind of an
[1:28:00] astounding thing for us I have some
[1:28:03] scriptures written here and a few notes
[1:28:04] that I will try to run over to explain
[1:28:07] to you why to the best of my knowledge
[1:28:11] and maybe then after this that the Lord
[1:28:14] with his grace tonight will take the
[1:28:15] wise away from us but did most all of us
[1:28:20] I suppose at one time or other has
[1:28:23] wondered why that this greatest event of
[1:28:27] all
[1:28:28] times was revealed to
[1:28:32] Shepherds why was it revealed to
[1:28:34] Shepherds and not to the theologians of
[1:28:38] that
[1:28:39] day they were the one were trained to
[1:28:41] hear it and why did it
[1:28:45] come and bypass the rich and come to the
[1:28:52] poor also why did it bypass the learned
[1:28:58] and wise and come to the humble and
[1:29:05] unlearned there is a few questions of
[1:29:07] why in this and another reason I might
[1:29:11] say notice the babe was born in
[1:29:15] Bethlehem which Bethlehem in the Hebrew
[1:29:19] interpretation as we had a couple years
[1:29:22] ago here Beth hem means the house of
[1:29:25] God's bread and we proved in the
[1:29:28] scriptures he could not come any other
[1:29:31] place Bethlehem was founded by Rahab and
[1:29:36] her uh her husband Rahab was a harlot
[1:29:39] that a general courted from the the uh
[1:29:42] Israelite Army after they had taken uh
[1:29:45] Jericho and by faith she believed the
[1:29:49] message of God in her condition and she
[1:29:51] was
[1:29:52] saved and from there when Joshua divided
[1:29:57] up the lands of where each one would be
[1:30:00] and there's a great lesson that sometime
[1:30:02] I hope to be able to bring a Tucson of
[1:30:05] those Hebrew mothers giving birth to
[1:30:07] those babies when she graned at the
[1:30:10] birth pain of the baby she called the
[1:30:13] name of the baby and that positionally
[1:30:16] placed it in the promised land its tribe
[1:30:20] a great thing all the word of God fits
[1:30:22] right together if doesn't fit together
[1:30:25] it's not God's word is Misfit it's your
[1:30:27] thought is misfitting to the word it all
[1:30:31] fits together so then he was the bread
[1:30:34] of life as we taught last week in
[1:30:36] Phoenix or week before last and being
[1:30:39] the bread of life he could come no place
[1:30:41] else but the house of God's
[1:30:43] bread and that was the why now here
[1:30:47] Jesus is born in
[1:30:49] Bethlehem and in Bethlehem there was Sy
[1:30:54] God great religious leaders lived in
[1:30:58] Bethlehem David the great king shepherd
[1:31:03] was born in
[1:31:05] Bethlehem his father Jess was born in
[1:31:09] Bethlehem his grandfather oit was born
[1:31:12] in Bethlehem also all the way back he
[1:31:17] came from
[1:31:19] Bethlehem and here Jesus the son of
[1:31:23] David is born in Bethlehem right under
[1:31:27] the shadows of the great
[1:31:32] Cathedrals then if those people are
[1:31:34] trained and have been looking for the
[1:31:37] Messiah for all these years 4,000 years
[1:31:42] the Messiah had been prophesied to
[1:31:45] come and then if the Messiah be born in
[1:31:49] the shadow of the cathedral why did they
[1:31:52] have to go plum back up mountains to a
[1:31:56] bunch of unlearned
[1:31:58] un to
[1:31:59] bring the great
[1:32:06] me
[1:32:10] Shepherds not the wise
[1:32:18] and it's a strange thing
[1:32:21] is but there's got to be a white
[1:32:24] somewhere there is a why now there's got
[1:32:26] to be an answer
[1:32:28] why and no man knows the answer save God
[1:32:33] he's the one that knows the answer now
[1:32:36] remember the Messiah was already in the
[1:32:39] city BN in the city in a stable right by
[1:32:43] the great Cathedrals where
[1:32:46] the and the theologians and the wise
[1:32:50] trained all was there waiting for the
[1:32:55] Messiah and there he was right in their
[1:32:59] [Music]
[1:33:01] midst but why then did they go to the
[1:33:06] out on the hills of Judea to unlearned
[1:33:12] untrained
[1:33:15] uncultured poorest of
[1:33:18] all look like the most unfit person for
[1:33:22] such a task to reveal the message and
[1:33:26] send them out to bring the
[1:33:30] message you know my opinion it might not
[1:33:34] Mount to very much but I want to pass my
[1:33:38] opinion I believe it's because of the
[1:33:41] wisdom of God that he knew they wouldn't
[1:33:45] receive such a message the way it
[1:33:48] come it wasn't in the taste of their
[1:33:52] learning it was
[1:33:54] different it wasn't what they had been
[1:33:58] trained to believe he would be
[1:34:00] like it was contrary to their
[1:34:04] theological
[1:34:07] understanding all their
[1:34:10] training all their learning was
[1:34:13] bypassed become
[1:34:16] not I believe it was the wisdom of God
[1:34:19] that knew that they would receive such a
[1:34:22] message so the Messiah was here and
[1:34:26] there must be somebody
[1:34:29] recognizing and he knew those who hadn't
[1:34:31] been mixed up and such stuff as that he
[1:34:34] would be more able to get his message to
[1:34:37] an unlearned group than he would be to a
[1:34:40] mixed up group that was so set in their
[1:34:43] ways that nothing could turn them not
[1:34:45] even the word of
[1:34:49] God and now Christian friends let me ask
[1:34:53] this
[1:34:54] question With all sincerity and love I
[1:34:59] just wonder if he would make the same
[1:35:03] act tonight and send to us in this
[1:35:08] generation the promis word that's
[1:35:10] promised for this generation I wonder if
[1:35:14] our theologians and Educators and wise
[1:35:18] wouldn't turn the message down just the
[1:35:20] same as they did then man doesn't change
[1:35:23] amen
[1:35:25] neither does God's word
[1:35:27] change he's the unchanging
[1:35:30] God he doesn't
[1:35:33] change
[1:35:36] notice Angels coming and H Angels coming
[1:35:42] and giving their message to man of such
[1:35:46] low a
[1:35:48] state when there were a man there much
[1:35:51] more Earthly thought of qualified in
[1:35:54] these poor illiterate
[1:36:00] Shepherds the shepherd was the most
[1:36:02] illiterate of anybody he didn't need to
[1:36:05] know nothing but just about his sheep he
[1:36:08] didn't need to know
[1:36:10] mathematics he didn't need to know how
[1:36:12] to to split an
[1:36:14] atom he didn't need no
[1:36:18] scholarship he just had to know his
[1:36:21] sheep that's all that he needed to
[1:36:25] know and God the great wisdom and the
[1:36:29] fountain and resource of all
[1:36:32] wisdom would choose such a person as
[1:36:36] that persons rather as that and bypass
[1:36:40] all the well Tred Scholars that's
[1:36:43] trained to know
[1:36:45] that it speaks one thing that they were
[1:36:48] trained in the wrong
[1:36:51] field passing up all the Imp important
[1:36:53] of the Land There were important people
[1:36:57] great
[1:36:58] teachers keas is the high priest many
[1:37:01] other great men all Israel's Mighty
[1:37:05] learned all the denominations and all
[1:37:08] the boasting theologians God bypassed
[1:37:10] every one of them
[1:37:12] am uh that's God's
[1:37:16] wisdom notice the highest
[1:37:20] Heavens Hasting to honor Earth's most
[1:37:25] humble and
[1:37:27] unlearned the highest of
[1:37:30] Heavens came down to make himself known
[1:37:33] to the lowest of the
[1:37:36] earth bypassing all
[1:37:39] between to make yourself known the
[1:37:42] common
[1:37:44] herdsman coming to give these common
[1:37:47] herdsmen the greatest message Of All
[1:37:51] Times there had been many great
[1:37:54] Messengers we' think of the Noah's day
[1:37:57] and the prophets and and the great
[1:37:59] priest and so forth they been in the
[1:38:00] Days Gone By the Great learned man Kings
[1:38:03] potent takes
[1:38:04] monarchs but here he comes with the
[1:38:07] greatest of all the
[1:38:09] messages what was the message Messiah is
[1:38:11] here
[1:38:13] now and to make that known he bypassed
[1:38:17] all the train to make it known to Humble
[1:38:21] Shepherds think of it all all of the
[1:38:24] clergymen all of the churchmen all of
[1:38:26] the teachers all of the the theological
[1:38:30] training all the money had been spent
[1:38:33] all the churches and the doctrines and
[1:38:35] the denominations was all
[1:38:37] bypassed all the learning if they had
[1:38:39] spent on all the all the missionaries
[1:38:42] and all the priting all the membership
[1:38:44] and everything that they had thought
[1:38:46] they had done honor to God yet the key
[1:38:48] message of all of it was bypassed from
[1:38:51] them strange why
[1:38:55] see and notice not only that but the
[1:38:59] most unlikely place for such an
[1:39:03] event the
[1:39:05] sh message was in the most
[1:39:18] unlikely Jesus I wonder if it would be
[1:39:20] in an unlik
[1:39:27] a a high
[1:39:29] cultured world in the church to a bunch
[1:39:32] of
[1:39:34] of oh
[1:39:37] Heretics I wonder if that wouldn't be
[1:39:40] where we'd find
[1:39:41] him the most unlikely place and to the
[1:39:46] most
[1:39:47] unqualified
[1:39:48] speakers Shepherds know nothing about
[1:39:51] speaking only calling sheep
[1:39:54] but maybe that's why it
[1:39:57] comes but it was a promised
[1:40:00] word notice it could do that again it
[1:40:05] bypassed all the Nobles of the
[1:40:08] land it bypassed all the Nobles and was
[1:40:12] revealed to the no
[1:40:14] bodies all the Nobles that were
[1:40:17] decorated with with great doctors
[1:40:19] Divinity and and psychology and and
[1:40:23] highly uh educations and great
[1:40:26] Cathedrals and things it was all
[1:40:29] bypassed and revealed to no
[1:40:33] bodies the wisdom the infinite wisdom of
[1:40:37] almighty God did
[1:40:40] it to make known to them the greatest
[1:40:43] message ever was the Messiah is now on
[1:40:47] Earth what a wisdom could only come from
[1:40:51] God who knows wisdom
[1:40:53] all the
[1:40:55] wisdom and all of the schooling and
[1:40:58] everything was now laid to waste and
[1:41:01] byass by the great wisdom of
[1:41:04] God I keep repeating that because I want
[1:41:08] it to go down
[1:41:10] deep all laid the waste it was of no
[1:41:13] good bypassed it all to let God's wisdom
[1:41:17] have the right away that God takes the
[1:41:22] nothings to make the
[1:41:26] something we could stop here and speak
[1:41:28] of John we could stop and speak of
[1:41:30] Elijah nobody knows where Elijah come
[1:41:33] from all you know he just appeared on
[1:41:35] the scene the
[1:41:37] prophets they were
[1:41:40] nobody but God
[1:41:44] CH them and
[1:41:49] bypass the ethics of the church
[1:41:54] to make sure that he is God he takes
[1:41:57] something that's nothing to do something
[1:42:00] with
[1:42:03] it he shows his wisdom and his godhead
[1:42:07] by doing so that he takes the nothings
[1:42:10] when he first made a man he just took a
[1:42:12] ball of clay and made a man out of it
[1:42:15] where it was nothing but clay but he
[1:42:16] made a
[1:42:17] man God takes the nothing's now to do
[1:42:20] the something's
[1:42:22] with and as long as we think we're
[1:42:24] something and we cannot be used in the
[1:42:26] hand of God we must forsake all we ever
[1:42:30] knew or learn pardon me like the great
[1:42:33] St Paul he said he had to forget all he
[1:42:36] ever learned that he might know
[1:42:39] Christ all their
[1:42:41] schooling all their teachings and so
[1:42:43] forth was working out to the worst for
[1:42:47] them it finally denied him the very
[1:42:52] schooling that they had had for him to
[1:42:54] believe him turned around and become his
[1:42:57] most critical enemy and crucified
[1:43:01] him do you know that history repeats
[1:43:05] itself ever so
[1:43:08] often it's a noted
[1:43:10] fact it could happen
[1:43:13] again right by the side of us or you say
[1:43:16] if I live then well if you want to know
[1:43:19] what you'd have done then look at your
[1:43:21] present State now
[1:43:23] and you can see what you'd have done
[1:43:25] then because it certainly is
[1:43:30] revealing train to believe his word and
[1:43:34] then when his word was Vindicated before
[1:43:36] their very eyes they denied the word
[1:43:39] that was made Vindication am when God
[1:43:43] proved what he would do and said what he
[1:43:45] would do and proved what he would do
[1:43:48] then they turned around and called this
[1:43:50] man an evil spirit which cursed them all
[1:43:56] amen think of what taking
[1:43:59] place think of what caus them their
[1:44:02] training caus them not to recognize the
[1:44:07] very word made flesh for their day the
[1:44:12] very training that they had in their
[1:44:14] schools with the very best of
[1:44:17] teachers and you say well we wouldn't do
[1:44:20] that today their teachers were far
[1:44:22] Supreme to our today Superior to our
[1:44:28] teachers and they failed they didn't
[1:44:31] have
[1:44:32] 996 different organizations as we have
[1:44:35] today they had about three and in the
[1:44:39] Three Bottle down to three and none of
[1:44:42] the three recognized
[1:44:45] it this goes to show that What man does
[1:44:48] is foolishness to
[1:44:50] God now
[1:44:53] they fail to recognize it now and they
[1:44:57] do the same thing
[1:44:59] again man intention is good it always is
[1:45:03] good and man never changes his posture
[1:45:09] he never changes his ways much I'm
[1:45:12] talking to the man of the world man is
[1:45:15] always praising God religious man for
[1:45:19] what he
[1:45:20] done and always pointing people to what
[1:45:23] he's going to do and then ignoring what
[1:45:26] he's doing see that's just man he's made
[1:45:31] that way he's always been that way and
[1:45:34] you Bible readers tonight know that
[1:45:35] that's according to the word right
[1:45:38] they're always praising God for what he
[1:45:40] has done saying what he will do and
[1:45:43] ignoring what he's doing that's just the
[1:45:45] habit of
[1:45:49] man the reason that they had did this
[1:45:52] the teachers
[1:45:53] to my opinion now they had interpreted
[1:45:57] the word because they all believed in a
[1:46:00] coming Messiah all Israel believed it
[1:46:04] they do yet
[1:46:05] today but the reason that they didn't
[1:46:09] recognized
[1:46:10] him his message wasn't according to
[1:46:14] their
[1:46:16] ecclesiastical
[1:46:18] fit they uh the the interpretation that
[1:46:21] they had of the word
[1:46:23] the Messiah never manifested himself in
[1:46:26] the way that they had interpreted that
[1:46:28] he would do it so and therefore they did
[1:46:32] not recognize him because it didn't fit
[1:46:35] their
[1:46:36] interpretation as I've said before and
[1:46:39] say again God doesn't need anybody to
[1:46:41] interpret his word he is his own
[1:46:46] interpreter now the Bible says let me
[1:46:49] prove to you now that that is the truth
[1:46:53] Isaiah the prophet 715 years before this
[1:46:56] happened Isaiah the prophet said a
[1:46:59] virgin shall conceive and shall bear a
[1:47:02] child there's no doubt that everyone in
[1:47:05] that age thought their daughter would be
[1:47:07] that woman because Isaiah said it but
[1:47:10] you see it was 700 years
[1:47:13] later but when God didn't need anybody
[1:47:17] to interpret his word when he'll do it
[1:47:18] or how he would do it he said he would
[1:47:20] do it and he did it
[1:47:23] amen God promised that he over in Isaiah
[1:47:27] also I'll read the 28th chapter about
[1:47:29] the 18th verse and also in Joel 228 that
[1:47:33] in the last days the last 2,000 years he
[1:47:36] had pour out his Spirit upon All Flesh
[1:47:39] he said your sons and daughters shall
[1:47:41] prophesy your young man shall see
[1:47:43] Visions your old man shall dream dreams
[1:47:46] and the things that he would do Isaiah
[1:47:49] said with stammering lips and other
[1:47:51] tongues will I speak to this people and
[1:47:53] this is the rest but they wouldn't hear
[1:47:56] it they waged their heads and walked by
[1:47:57] it he said all the tables of God would
[1:48:01] become full of vomit and there would be
[1:48:03] nothing clean and if that isn't a
[1:48:06] picture of Jerusalem and the Church of
[1:48:09] that day at the coming Messiah it's a
[1:48:11] picture today the
[1:48:13] same it's just repeating itself now when
[1:48:18] God says he'll do a thing he did it
[1:48:20] regardless of what anybody else thinks
[1:48:22] about it what anybody says when God
[1:48:24] speaks to something he's Duty bound to
[1:48:26] interpret that word himself and his in
[1:48:29] Vindication of the word is his own
[1:48:32] interpretation
[1:48:34] notice vindicating his messiah's
[1:48:37] message he promised what the Messiah
[1:48:40] would do when he come and when he came
[1:48:43] even when the wise men in the East had
[1:48:46] looked down south Westward from where
[1:48:49] they were at in Babylon and they saw a
[1:48:52] Majestic
[1:48:54] Star did you know there's not a speck of
[1:48:57] History nowhere that any Observatory
[1:49:00] where they even kept the the uh the time
[1:49:03] by stars great man who studied these
[1:49:07] Stars there's not no history says that
[1:49:09] any of them seen that star at all why it
[1:49:13] wasn't given to them they wasn't looking
[1:49:16] for such but these wise men know that
[1:49:19] there would be a star of Jacob rise amen
[1:49:23] and they were looking for it and it
[1:49:25] passed from the time that Jesus was born
[1:49:29] in Bethlehem now I know our Christian
[1:49:32] Traditions it's just like our churches
[1:49:35] it has things Topsy turby you go out
[1:49:38] here and you see wise men coming to
[1:49:39] worship a baby there's not such a thing
[1:49:42] in the scripture two years later they
[1:49:44] got there coming down through the Plains
[1:49:46] and across the Tigers River they never
[1:49:48] come to worship an infant but a young
[1:49:50] child amen about about 2 years old why
[1:49:54] was it at the same time Herod slew all
[1:49:56] the children from 2 years old under that
[1:49:59] he might catch the Messiah you see they
[1:50:03] God had Vindicated by his word and when
[1:50:05] these wise men came to Jerusalem the
[1:50:08] star LED them to the religious capital
[1:50:11] of the world Jerusalem and as soon as
[1:50:14] they entered those Gates that star the
[1:50:17] supernatural that had led them refused
[1:50:19] to show them anymore up and down the
[1:50:21] streets these fine man rich man with
[1:50:25] fine great camels and so forth up and
[1:50:27] down the street saying where is this
[1:50:29] Barn King of the Jews we saw a star in
[1:50:31] the east and that great religious
[1:50:35] Capital after two years of the
[1:50:37] shepherd's message still didn't have the
[1:50:41] answer and know nothing about
[1:50:42] it the head of all the denominations
[1:50:46] amen didn't have the answer so it
[1:50:50] Disturbed the Sanhedrin and they called
[1:50:52] for the scribes to come read and they
[1:50:55] read Micah's story The Prophet which
[1:50:58] said thou Bethlehem art thou not the
[1:51:00] least of all the princes of Judah the
[1:51:03] least but out of the shall come a
[1:51:06] governor that shall rule My People
[1:51:09] Israel and after the scriptures being
[1:51:12] read and still being Vindicated Before
[1:51:15] Their Eyes they still didn't accept it
[1:51:20] though the scripture said so
[1:51:23] I doubt very much they would today if
[1:51:26] the scriptures that's promised for this
[1:51:28] day would be made
[1:51:30] manifest I may never preach to you again
[1:51:33] but I want you to get
[1:51:34] this still they wouldn't
[1:51:38] believe the great wisdom of the father
[1:51:41] makes man's Wisdom so
[1:51:44] foolish that he belittles the man he
[1:51:48] actually comes to the place the work
[1:51:50] makes man feel so ashamed of him self
[1:51:52] and he's
[1:51:55] not rather proves that is true and he's
[1:51:59] doing just what he through in every age
[1:52:03] still does it see
[1:52:07] how whole matter was now
[1:52:18] what down to speak to herdsman
[1:52:26] coming to speak
[1:52:30] to Shepherd I
[1:52:37] wonder of of talking with a
[1:52:45] Shepherd like to say it because of my uh
[1:52:49] remark I'm fixing to say after a while
[1:52:52] but the Shepherd stays with the Sheep so
[1:52:56] much until he even laughs like the Sheep
[1:53:01] blatant he talks like the
[1:53:04] sheep and he smells like the
[1:53:07] Sheep that's
[1:53:11] right because he's with the Sheep that's
[1:53:16] all he knows is his
[1:53:19] sheep now the vindictive word of Truth
[1:53:24] when these Shepherds humble
[1:53:29] uneducated man what a honor how fitting
[1:53:34] it is to a
[1:53:36] Shepherd to receive a message of a
[1:53:40] newborn Sheep
[1:53:44] amen it could come to nothing else but a
[1:53:47] Shepherd that's why he was born in a
[1:53:49] stable and not in a house sheep or not
[1:53:52] born in a house or in a pink decorated
[1:53:56] hospital room see they are born in the
[1:53:59] barn in in the
[1:54:01] fields that's the reason he was led to
[1:54:05] Calvary you can't not make a sheep Walk
[1:54:08] The Gang way to the slaughter did you
[1:54:11] know that in the slaughter yards they
[1:54:13] have a goat that leads the sheep and
[1:54:17] when he gets up to where the killing
[1:54:18] place is he jumps out and lets the Sheep
[1:54:21] go on a sheep has to be led he can't
[1:54:24] lead
[1:54:25] himself so therefore it had to be the
[1:54:28] shepherd coming for the his sheep when
[1:54:32] they found the god baby exactly where
[1:54:35] the messenger said he would be and when
[1:54:39] they found
[1:54:40] this mess message of the messenger in
[1:54:45] the manger
[1:54:47] exactly where the angel said it would be
[1:54:51] now I heard people say an angel spoke to
[1:54:54] me he said thus and thus how ridiculous
[1:54:58] sometime I've heard people say that an
[1:55:00] angel spoke to him and told him thus and
[1:55:02] thus which was absolutely contrary to
[1:55:05] the word now How Could An Angel do that
[1:55:10] it just couldn't be and if God told you
[1:55:13] a certain certain thing would happen you
[1:55:16] say he told you that and it doesn't
[1:55:18] happen then it wasn't God speaking to
[1:55:20] you just remember that's right God
[1:55:22] doesn't lie he's not found in a
[1:55:25] lie when they found the baby what a joy
[1:55:29] it must have been to them because the
[1:55:31] angel that gave them the message they
[1:55:34] found it just exactly the way the angel
[1:55:38] said it would be and just in the place
[1:55:40] where the angel said it would be what a
[1:55:42] thing that must have been to him in a
[1:55:44] Manger why see how at ease these
[1:55:48] herdsman was in the stable
[1:55:52] amen why do you think a theologian would
[1:55:54] have been in there he a put a pin over
[1:55:58] his nose and said get me out of this
[1:56:01] place he would have been so out of place
[1:56:04] he' been in
[1:56:06] misery but you see it was just at home
[1:56:09] to the shepherd prise the Lord God knows
[1:56:11] where to send his
[1:56:13] message just exactly right and this
[1:56:17] state the Shepherds was in them in their
[1:56:19] stable with their lamb a vindicat at
[1:56:23] message that they had heard how
[1:56:26] beautiful in the presence of the Messiah
[1:56:29] Vindicated word of their message when
[1:56:33] the Shepherds heard that the Messiah was
[1:56:36] on Earth and came into his presence
[1:56:39] right in their own environment and found
[1:56:43] the message to be true was Vindicated
[1:56:45] there how that must have made those men
[1:56:47] feel to find that God had done this
[1:56:51] great thing for them
[1:56:53] why Scholars would have been so out of
[1:56:55] place there under such circumstances
[1:56:58] they had all left right quick why the
[1:57:02] messengers coming to Common herdsman
[1:57:05] maybe they could have not
[1:57:08] even these some of these herdsmen might
[1:57:10] not have even been able to have sign
[1:57:12] their own name very doubtful you know
[1:57:16] the herdsman that Jesus chose when he
[1:57:19] was here on Earth the herd his sheep
[1:57:23] lovest thou me Peter more than these yay
[1:57:28] Lord thou knowest I love the feed my
[1:57:30] sheep and the Bible said that Peter was
[1:57:34] an ignorant and unlearned
[1:57:38] man still choosing
[1:57:42] Shepherd the church members of those
[1:57:45] past days and priest well trained
[1:57:49] Society in that day would have been so
[1:57:52] out of place in a
[1:57:55] stable now I'm not quite sure that many
[1:57:59] of you could understand maybe you City
[1:58:02] people
[1:58:04] what a judian stable smelt like what it
[1:58:09] look
[1:58:11] like as the animals in that stable and
[1:58:15] what it would have been why some of
[1:58:18] these Classics of the day would be so
[1:58:21] out of place there they they wouldn't
[1:58:22] even enter the door amen but it pleased
[1:58:25] God am by his infinite wisdom to reveal
[1:58:29] it to such as would receive
[1:58:33] it the scholars and wise men of that day
[1:58:38] would certainly would not have received
[1:58:40] it they had been so
[1:58:42] humiliated to be caught in such a
[1:58:45] place why the first place if they would
[1:58:49] have went back to their church and would
[1:58:52] have witnessed that they tended such a
[1:58:54] meeting and believed a bunch of
[1:58:59] uneducated Shepherds bringing such a
[1:59:02] phenomena they had have been
[1:59:03] excommunicated from their church amen
[1:59:06] they' have been thrown out of the
[1:59:09] Society of
[1:59:11] Bethlehem if they have been caught
[1:59:14] listening to such an unlearned bunch of
[1:59:16] people as these Shepherds was humiliated
[1:59:20] they certainly would have been
[1:59:22] if they had have been associated with
[1:59:24] such common
[1:59:26] people and
[1:59:29] being accepting such
[1:59:32] heresies as to believe that God would
[1:59:35] bring his message to an uneducated bunch
[1:59:39] of shepherds when they had everything
[1:59:41] all prepared for
[1:59:44] it they would have lost their
[1:59:46] affiliation that have had to give in
[1:59:48] their papers and would not have been
[1:59:50] able to have been uh uh recognized among
[1:59:54] the Society of their groups of that day
[1:59:58] because they had associated with such a
[2:00:00] thing and not with a better
[2:00:04] mind how dare you the priest would have
[2:00:08] said You Come Into My Sanctuary here
[2:00:12] with such a heresy with such a
[2:00:16] foolish that's some unlearned Bushman
[2:00:19] out there that doesn't didn't go to
[2:00:23] through the prer and would believe such
[2:00:26] a message that an angel come down and
[2:00:28] spoke to him but what if the man would
[2:00:31] said I saw his message Vindicated
[2:00:36] amen he had said let me quickly give you
[2:00:39] your papers and get out of this Society
[2:00:42] amen times change but people
[2:00:45] don't it would have probably happened
[2:00:48] again
[2:00:49] today they would have been thr out other
[2:00:52] their
[2:00:53] churches but the Shepherds felt
[2:00:56] completely at ease in that place with
[2:00:59] God's
[2:01:00] lamb and any good shepherd does the same
[2:01:04] thing when a Good Shepherd over the
[2:01:06] sheep can see the word of God made plain
[2:01:08] and Vindicated of what he promised to do
[2:01:11] that Shepherd's right at home I don't
[2:01:13] care what anybody else says there's God
[2:01:16] promised it and God did it they say the
[2:01:18] days of Miracles is passed there's no
[2:01:20] such a thing as the baptism of the
[2:01:21] spirit there's no such thing as the
[2:01:23] baptism of the Holy Ghost that was for
[2:01:25] the apostles but let a true Shepherd of
[2:01:28] the word preach it in the power of the
[2:01:31] Resurrection that Jesus Christ is the
[2:01:33] same yesterday today and forever Peter
[2:01:35] said on the day of Pentecost the
[2:01:36] promises unto you and your children and
[2:01:38] to them as far off even as many as the
[2:01:40] Lord Our God shall call wherever he
[2:01:43] calls a promise in the same blessing is
[2:01:46] true and let a genuine word feeding
[2:01:50] Shepherd see that big indicated all the
[2:01:53] theologians in the world can't take it
[2:01:54] away from
[2:01:55] him because he know God said so and it
[2:01:59] happened that's all it's just God's word
[2:02:04] always his word was made flesh and was
[2:02:08] dwelling among them and they knew it
[2:02:11] not he promised the same thing in this
[2:02:15] day I wonder if we would recognize
[2:02:18] it the proud and wise had never received
[2:02:23] such a thing as that and they believed
[2:02:26] if there was such a thing as the Messiah
[2:02:30] on Earth it would certainly have to come
[2:02:34] to their denomination amen it would be
[2:02:36] their group would receive it or it
[2:02:39] wasn't
[2:02:40] right now just think right
[2:02:45] hard if it ain't in their group then did
[2:02:48] you notice
[2:02:50] then God never never chose any out of
[2:02:52] their group am but he chose that who
[2:02:56] wasn't connected with any of it because
[2:02:59] one group had said you see what we
[2:03:01] did and they do the same
[2:03:05] today but God chooses the nobody that's
[2:03:08] the reason he chose the
[2:03:10] shepherd the Shepherds was completely at
[2:03:12] home with the god lamb in their midst
[2:03:16] his word made flesh among them the proud
[2:03:19] and wise never received it pass by
[2:03:22] we could say as much for today or in any
[2:03:24] age it was the same things in the days
[2:03:26] of Martin Luther same thing in the days
[2:03:29] of John Wesley is the same things in the
[2:03:31] days of the
[2:03:33] Pentecostals but God stops for No Man's
[2:03:36] organization he moves his Spirit right
[2:03:38] on to vindicate his word what I have to
[2:03:43] be and come in the class to their own
[2:03:46] Council or they wouldn't receive it as
[2:03:50] they're so h wrong today all the
[2:03:53] churches that they're going to do such
[2:03:55] and such and unite all the churches
[2:03:57] together if they're looking for a
[2:03:59] messenger now who can unite all the
[2:04:01] Protestants Catholics and Orthodox
[2:04:03] everything together and make one great
[2:04:07] church my brethren I've had the
[2:04:11] privilege of preaching to hundreds of
[2:04:13] different religions and there's good man
[2:04:16] in all of them but now you remember I am
[2:04:20] prophesying every organization will have
[2:04:23] to accept this or not be an
[2:04:26] organization it's forcing it did you
[2:04:28] read the Tucson paper today or a
[2:04:31] Catholic priest help ordaining in the
[2:04:34] paper ordain in Missouri uh Protestant
[2:04:38] clergymen and who was recognized in it
[2:04:41] Presbyterians Baptists Lutheran and
[2:04:44] Assemblies of
[2:04:47] God it's in the Tucson paper today oh
[2:04:51] it's
[2:04:53] shocking it's not the man in there it's
[2:04:57] them ecclesiastical governmental heads
[2:05:00] that twist the thing in there the system
[2:05:04] that throws you into it whether you'll
[2:05:06] want to or not you can no longer be an
[2:05:09] organization and escape this wrath
[2:05:12] that's coming upon the Earth and you see
[2:05:13] if that isn't right I may be gone when
[2:05:16] it happens look back on one of these
[2:05:18] tapes then if it wasn't I'm a false
[2:05:22] witness if it was I've told the
[2:05:25] truth they would have called it some
[2:05:28] kind of a working of an evil spirit
[2:05:31] against their positive
[2:05:34] thinking you so much there about
[2:05:36] positive thinking and just put your mind
[2:05:39] on anything and think positive on it the
[2:05:41] devil can do that there's only one thing
[2:05:45] that's rules over all and that's God's
[2:05:50] word if you're thinking contrary to the
[2:05:52] word forget your
[2:05:54] thinking think on the
[2:05:57] word
[2:05:59] Messiah they thought would not be found
[2:06:01] in such a place a mess as that could you
[2:06:05] imagine a fine great high priest or
[2:06:09] clergyman all Polished in theology would
[2:06:13] come down to a stable full of
[2:06:16] manure and accept the message of a poor
[2:06:19] humble Shepherd that had no education
[2:06:22] and would come say see I can prove it to
[2:06:26] you this is the baby this is the
[2:06:31] messenger and you know what them people
[2:06:33] have said the man is honest he's very
[2:06:38] sincere in what he's saying but he's
[2:06:41] absolutely
[2:06:44] wrong I've seen people live such good
[2:06:47] lives until people wouldn't believe
[2:06:49] couldn't say nothing about them but they
[2:06:51] say he's sincerely wrong he just doesn't
[2:06:54] know what he's talking about God he
[2:06:56] wouldn't do such a thing as that but
[2:06:58] here they had the evidence and after the
[2:07:02] evidence go up there at the stable and
[2:07:04] see if that baby isn't laying there am
[2:07:08] they' say you've been Bewitched but some
[2:07:11] evil spirit that's caused you to say
[2:07:13] such yet it was according to the word of
[2:07:17] God and they were too blind to see it
[2:07:20] because they're theology had blinded
[2:07:24] him what a
[2:07:26] tragedy caught in such a place and such
[2:07:30] a mess as this was in a
[2:07:34] stable when they had a beautiful place
[2:07:36] for him to come they had everything
[2:07:38] fixed for him to come and then to think
[2:07:40] that he would come down and go and not
[2:07:42] bring their teachers the message and
[2:07:44] would give it to a bunch of unlearned
[2:07:46] Shepherds and then bring his own son and
[2:07:49] have him born in a a stable a common
[2:07:53] Livery
[2:07:55] stable well in in a Manger of
[2:07:58] hay why it couldn't be so they wouldn't
[2:08:01] believe it because it was so humble and
[2:08:04] it's so simple that's how the wise
[2:08:07] always overlooks it it's so simple it
[2:08:11] confounds them they look for a god way
[2:08:13] out there when he's right here they're
[2:08:16] looking for something way Yonder when
[2:08:18] it's right here with them now Christ RIS
[2:08:21] from the dead the same yesterday today
[2:08:23] and
[2:08:24] forever all their great things was
[2:08:28] bypassed but it sure was the truth that
[2:08:32] there was a
[2:08:34] messiah we know it today we believe it
[2:08:38] today we accept it
[2:08:41] today but then if God promised something
[2:08:44] for this Christmas promise something for
[2:08:46] this day and proves that it's so and we
[2:08:50] still walk away from it we're just in
[2:08:52] the same class same was back there at
[2:08:54] that day that bypassed because it don't
[2:08:57] does not come in our denominational
[2:09:00] taste that's why we're in such a mess
[2:09:03] this Christmas Jesus Christ is not dead
[2:09:08] he's alive he's here today amen the
[2:09:11] Bible said he's the same yesterday today
[2:09:13] and forever he said in St John 14:12 he
[2:09:17] that believeth on me not he that makes
[2:09:19] believe he that says he believes he that
[2:09:22] believeth on me the works that I do
[2:09:25] shall he do
[2:09:26] also and More Than This shall he do
[2:09:29] because I go to the father and I've seen
[2:09:32] him in my own life do more of the same
[2:09:36] works that he did then that's written in
[2:09:37] the pages of this Bible and he goes over
[2:09:40] the top of the head and the wise today
[2:09:43] and revealed to babes such as will learn
[2:09:46] that Jesus prayed
[2:09:47] for it is true he's done more than he
[2:09:51] I've seen in my day of my 33 years of
[2:09:54] ministry I've seen him do more than I
[2:09:57] have read of him doing in the Bible more
[2:09:59] of the same thing now no matter what he
[2:10:02] did then do you think the sanadrin
[2:10:04] believed him well they said you're
[2:10:07] Bewitched but find out where they made
[2:10:10] their mistakes was to find out and
[2:10:12] finding out not what their Creed said
[2:10:14] but what the word said Messiah would do
[2:10:17] in their day there's where we make the
[2:10:19] mistake today not searching the
[2:10:22] scriptures Jesus told him search the
[2:10:24] scriptures in them you think you have
[2:10:25] eternal life and they are they that
[2:10:27] testify of me they tell you who I am
[2:10:32] notice God forne they would do this
[2:10:36] that's just the why he had to take it to
[2:10:38] Shepherds he knew they wouldn't do it
[2:10:40] they wouldn't receive it now do you see
[2:10:43] why it had to be
[2:10:45] Shepherd why Shepherds theologians
[2:10:48] wouldn't receive it why Shepherds again
[2:10:50] but contrary to his word no they were
[2:10:53] shepherds they know sheep and that's
[2:10:55] what he was born a sheep a lamb
[2:10:59] notice he was the lamb they were they
[2:11:03] were the only kind that would accept him
[2:11:07] a Shepherd was the only thing would
[2:11:08] accept the
[2:11:11] lamb they know how to take care of it
[2:11:14] and so is it today when we get the
[2:11:16] Lamb's message now the Striking the most
[2:11:21] humblest uneducated man adoring Emmanuel
[2:11:27] in a stable
[2:11:29] amen the most and there were people out
[2:11:33] there at the same days teaching their
[2:11:36] theology great crowds drawing everywhere
[2:11:39] from all over the land they come to
[2:11:41] sacrifices which Jehovah said was a
[2:11:43] stench in his
[2:11:45] nostrils and here was humble Shepherds
[2:11:48] in a stable adoring Emmanuel
[2:11:52] will God himself made flesh and laying
[2:11:55] in a
[2:11:57] stable see how we with our great
[2:12:01] learnings and our head sticking back
[2:12:03] like we know something and God bypasses
[2:12:06] the whole
[2:12:08] thing he does what he promises to do and
[2:12:12] he always does that but think of these
[2:12:14] lowly Shepherds out there now adoring a
[2:12:18] Emmanuel in a stable it's most striking
[2:12:22] sure is
[2:12:24] then out after they had adored him and
[2:12:27] realized that the message that they had
[2:12:29] been preaching was Vindicated there they
[2:12:32] are were out praising God with the most
[2:12:36] incredible message of an
[2:12:39] Angel I'll compare that with today just
[2:12:43] stop a minute and
[2:12:44] think
[2:12:46] man out adoring God and praising him for
[2:12:51] what they had seen what they had heard
[2:12:54] what they knew was the truth with a
[2:12:56] message that was
[2:12:58] incredible to the intellectual mind it
[2:13:02] was contrary to all ecclesiastical
[2:13:06] thinking and yet it was the truth it's
[2:13:10] the truth they believe it and now how
[2:13:13] foolish can the wisdom a man
[2:13:16] be then saying that an angel chir sang
[2:13:21] to them the first
[2:13:24] noil could you imagine that that a
[2:13:27] Shepherd That Couldn't Write his name
[2:13:29] smelling like a sheep
[2:13:31] pin walking down the street Hing glory
[2:13:34] to God in the
[2:13:36] highest we know that he's on Earth the
[2:13:40] priest said that man's out of his mind
[2:13:43] look up on the books and see if he's a
[2:13:44] member of our
[2:13:46] congregation he certainly embarrasses Us
[2:13:49] by his unethical teachings
[2:13:51] get him away from us we will not be
[2:13:54] embarrassed amongst the people well you
[2:13:56] can be embarrassed amongst the people
[2:13:58] and glorified in the sight of God or
[2:14:00] take your
[2:14:02] Cho because remember the ecclesiastical
[2:14:06] Taste of the day don't fit God's word
[2:14:09] there's not no 969 different tastes of
[2:14:12] it it's one taste one word one God
[2:14:14] that's
[2:14:15] all saying that Angels sang The First
[2:14:18] Noel to him and also
[2:14:21] that uh they got a message from an angel
[2:14:24] an angel appeared to him give them a
[2:14:26] message and they went and found out that
[2:14:27] message was truth and say besides that
[2:14:29] the angel sing the first noil to us
[2:14:32] could you imagine they said that poor
[2:14:34] fell they never had anything like that
[2:14:36] to happen among them you know so it was
[2:14:38] kind of strange Doctrine to them that's
[2:14:40] the reason they couldn't find it in the
[2:14:42] Scriptures it wasn't for them to find it
[2:14:44] incredible to the wise no such
[2:14:47] experience had ever happened to them
[2:14:49] unbelievable but still it was the truth
[2:14:52] it's the truth we know it's the truth
[2:14:54] think Christ's first Converse and first
[2:14:59] congregation was Sheep
[2:15:01] Man not clergy man Sheep
[2:15:05] Man
[2:15:07] herders why Shepherds
[2:15:11] notice out praising and glorifying God
[2:15:15] for what they had seen and heard heard
[2:15:17] Angels Sing for their first time to a
[2:15:21] human
[2:15:23] being angels have never sang to a human
[2:15:25] being before and look at the choirs how
[2:15:29] they had stood and trained and trained
[2:15:31] those voices they had sing at the birth
[2:15:34] of the Messiah and they were all
[2:15:37] bypassed and Angels came down and sang
[2:15:40] to Common Sheep
[2:15:42] Man not with clergy clothes
[2:15:47] on and look got the first message
[2:15:54] and where it was given not in the
[2:15:57] cathedrals but in the
[2:15:59] wilderness out in the wilderness where
[2:16:02] the angel of the Lord
[2:16:04] came not in the church in the wilderness
[2:16:08] he wasn't even welcome in the church
[2:16:10] they thought he was they thought they
[2:16:11] had it but God proved that it was
[2:16:15] wrong he's able these stones to rise
[2:16:17] children to Abraham that's right the
[2:16:21] first time Angels ever
[2:16:23] sing at a celebration it was in
[2:16:27] heaven if you look in job 38:7 as to see
[2:16:30] some of you taking notes when God first
[2:16:34] planned on making his first creation the
[2:16:38] Earth job was a great smart man and he
[2:16:42] had all kinds of wisdom he said when I
[2:16:44] go up to the markets the young princes
[2:16:46] they all bow before me in just want a
[2:16:48] moment of my wisdom and he couldn't
[2:16:50] figure out why he had to be treated the
[2:16:52] way he
[2:16:53] was and so God asked him said g yourself
[2:16:57] up like a man because I'm coming down to
[2:16:59] talk to you and when God came down in a
[2:17:02] horor wind he said job where was you
[2:17:06] before I laid the foundations of the
[2:17:09] Earth when the morning Stars sang
[2:17:12] together and the sons of God shouted for
[2:17:14] Joy where were you then job and he was
[2:17:18] deflated at that time
[2:17:21] where was you see the first time Angels
[2:17:23] ever sing at a celebration was in heaven
[2:17:27] but the first time the ever sing on
[2:17:29] Earth was the Shepherds at the birth of
[2:17:33] God Emmanuel on
[2:17:36] Earth first human beings ever heard an
[2:17:38] angel sing was humble
[2:17:42] Shepherds when we take our painted fa
[2:17:45] women bobbed hair wearing shorts and
[2:17:48] swing some kind of a church robe around
[2:17:50] them and stand up and sing like
[2:17:52] something and then we think if God has
[2:17:54] to listen to that he's got Angels back
[2:17:56] on who can entertain him son before he
[2:17:59] ever made a human
[2:18:02] being get out and live and wear clothes
[2:18:06] that's an Abomination to God and how can
[2:18:09] you expect that to be of
[2:18:13] God you say well I belong to where was
[2:18:16] you when I laid the foundations of the
[2:18:18] Earth tell me where I
[2:18:21] fasten them to where is the axle that
[2:18:25] they turn on where were you then you
[2:18:29] think God has to ask us for some of our
[2:18:31] wisdom our wisdom is only foolish to him
[2:18:34] he does what he says he will
[2:18:37] do now notice God is fixing to make
[2:18:40] another creation the creating mortal
[2:18:44] Earth mortal life Angels sing in heaven
[2:18:47] but here he's creating a new life
[2:18:50] eternal life for
[2:18:52] man and he sing to his subjects through
[2:18:56] Angels on the earth not in heaven amen
[2:19:00] Heaven had eternal life see and he sang
[2:19:03] they sang to the heavens when the Mortal
[2:19:06] creation come in and here the immortal
[2:19:09] creation is coming in and now they're
[2:19:11] singing to Earthly people the first time
[2:19:15] the Shepherds striking isn't
[2:19:18] it he had started in New Creation what
[2:19:21] was it a creation of
[2:19:24] himself God was made flesh and dwelt
[2:19:27] Among Us that's the Bible said in the
[2:19:29] beginning of the creation of God God was
[2:19:32] created in human form in Jesus Christ
[2:19:35] his son God dwelt he built his
[2:19:38] Tabernacle of Flesh and Bones and lived
[2:19:40] in that Tabernacle God Emmanuel God With
[2:19:45] Us he built himself a house to live in
[2:19:48] it so he could respect his word to his
[2:19:51] subjects through that you know what God
[2:19:54] is when you see Christ remember there is
[2:19:57] always singing at the birth of a king
[2:20:00] how many know that of course you did
[2:20:02] well now do you think if this king would
[2:20:04] have been born down there a a woman
[2:20:06] would have come run into the cathedral
[2:20:07] somewhere and said make a bed ready
[2:20:09] right quick and get the doctors because
[2:20:11] I'm going to bring Emanuel to the earth
[2:20:13] a poor woman out of Nazareth the lest
[2:20:16] City meaner than Tucson or any the rest
[2:20:18] of them and yet this little woman comes
[2:20:21] running up there to the great high
[2:20:23] priest and said I'm fixing to give birth
[2:20:24] to Emanuel that throw her in jail you
[2:20:28] sure would they certainly was such a
[2:20:31] hares is that to be brought amongst his
[2:20:33] people he wouldn't have stood
[2:20:34] part NE would he today but just the same
[2:20:38] is happening just the same notice there
[2:20:40] has to be singing Kings would he
[2:20:42] wouldn't have been sang Too the people
[2:20:45] wouldn't have sing to him because they
[2:20:46] didn't believe him that's your reason
[2:20:49] here it comes
[2:20:51] you might as well get it that's the
[2:20:52] reason today the people's ashamed to
[2:20:54] praise God they're ashamed of Christ
[2:20:58] amen the great Cathedrals won't receive
[2:21:01] the baptism of the Holy
[2:21:03] Ghost they're so set in their
[2:21:05] ecclesiastical way that they will not
[2:21:09] receive it God's going to find somebody
[2:21:11] that he can get praised
[2:21:14] through He's Able of the stones to rise
[2:21:16] children to Abraham as I quote John
[2:21:19] again notice his subjects must sang to
[2:21:22] him and his subjects then was his angels
[2:21:27] and they sang to his Shepherds which was
[2:21:29] to take his message who should
[2:21:46] hear what a beautiful message this
[2:21:48] morning

[2:35:51] you all received the uh uh newsletter
[2:35:55] last week and it
[2:35:58] was
[2:36:00] amen many years ago when brother Bram
[2:36:04] was just a young boy he would ride his
[2:36:07] bicycle to shim's
[2:36:10] confessionary which had operated in
[2:36:12] downtown Jefferson Bill since
[2:36:16] 1891 where he would spend the dime he
[2:36:19] worked so hard all week to earn in those
[2:36:22] days the ice cream comb sold for only a
[2:36:25] penny each two pennies would purchase
[2:36:28] almost a half pound of candy
[2:36:56] parking his bcle he would hurly Dash up
[2:36:59] the counter where the jars of candy
[2:37:03] framed the antique mirror above the soda
[2:37:05] fountain and fill the glass display
[2:37:08] cases it would not take the Raggedy boy
[2:37:12] long to decide what he wanted because
[2:37:15] his favorite by far was the Red Hots
[2:37:19] which the the owner's son Sunny shimps
[2:37:22] measured into a bag for
[2:37:48] him sh Med
[2:37:54] Med some years later Sunny was stricken
[2:37:57] illness deemed incurable by five
[2:38:00] Specialists from Louisville
[2:38:03] Kentucky once his
[2:38:05] nurses once one of his nurses was Sister
[2:38:10] Margie Morgan who had been healed of
[2:38:14] cancer through brother braham's prayer
[2:38:17] upon her testimony he called for brother
[2:38:20] Brenham to come and pray for him when he
[2:38:23] looked down at the dying man the word of
[2:38:26] the Lord came forth thus says the Lord
[2:38:32] you will not die but you will sell me

[2:39:26] to the familiar
[2:39:29] counter looked at the candy displayed in
[2:39:32] the glass
[2:39:37] case us to eat them a long time ago

[2:40:11] a bag he
[2:40:13] commented commented that the local
