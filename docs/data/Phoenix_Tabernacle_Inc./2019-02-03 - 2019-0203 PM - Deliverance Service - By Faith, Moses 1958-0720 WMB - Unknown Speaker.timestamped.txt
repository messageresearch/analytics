[27:32] beautiful Shore in the sweet
[28:33] thank you very much good morning folks
[28:36] it's good to be here today in the
[28:40] tabernacle and I thought maybe if I got
[28:42] brother Neville to speak this morning I
[28:44] tried tonight and then I was looking
[28:48] back then to a Sunday School lesson for
[28:50] this morning and what a the Lord willing
[28:54] we'll try to to have this Sunday School
[28:57] lesson now it is bent in two weeks now
[29:02] about since I have gotten in and been
[29:06] very nervous as you understood that on
[29:09] the field I got real real worn out and
[29:12] could hardly go any farther and then I
[29:15] had to come in for just a little arrest
[29:18] and I've taken about three days down to
[29:21] Wolf Creek Dam down in Kentucky where I
[29:24] was born I thought oh I feel just
[29:28] wonderful now I'm fine I got back home
[29:31] and the first little thing met me in the
[29:33] face with some sort of a governmental
[29:35] affair with an income tax I went all the
[29:38] way at the bottom and so I realized it's
[29:41] going to take more than just a week or
[29:42] two to rest me up my ministry fixing to
[29:46] make the change now I have no meetings
[29:50] scheduled and that's the reason that I
[29:52] just kind of come aside and thought and
[29:55] now for the next few weeks I would just
[29:58] take a rest complete rest and wait on
[30:02] the Lord and many of you people in here
[30:06] as old-timers has been with us so long
[30:09] remembers that what the Lord has said to
[30:11] us he has always performed that walk he
[30:15] that he would do
[30:16] I remember when in the very beginning in
[30:20] the church here the morning we laid the
[30:21] tabernacle stone how that he throat
[30:25] laying in the stone on the Flyleaf or my
[30:28] Bible that morning that great vision
[30:30] that this is not your Tabernacle I said
[30:34] where is it Lord and set me out of the
[30:35] skies and a voice came I look and seen
[30:39] them three crosses like the trees and
[30:42] the fruit of them so forth you know what
[30:44] the vision is has been wrote out for
[30:45] years picking up the other day
[30:47] book up there reading some of the things
[30:49] that the Lord had told foretold already
[30:52] come to pass about this juvenile on
[30:55] stuff but about how the war would come
[30:57] out and all those things has hit just
[30:59] the two things left in one of those
[31:01] great prophecies that is for cars to be
[31:04] on the road with remote control we're
[31:06] looking like a age only you don't drive
[31:08] it it controls itself and then there
[31:10] will be a great woman rise up calls
[31:12] America is a woman's nation and it'll a
[31:16] great woman rise up and be President or
[31:19] something like that in the nation and
[31:20] then there will come a total
[31:22] annihilation the entire nation will be
[31:24] wiped out and that I predict now this is
[31:27] not the large saying this the other
[31:29] about the woman it is is the Lord but I
[31:32] predicted in nineteen and and thirty 33
[31:36] that the world would be total
[31:39] annihilation before 77 so I didn't know
[31:43] then that they had something that could
[31:44] annihilate it like they got now but I
[31:46] sing the nation and total annihilation
[31:49] just stump some trees and things like
[31:52] that play so it's on its Road and if all
[31:55] these other things has come to pass just
[31:57] as he said that will be also that just
[32:00] as he said in the scripture here what he
[32:03] says if Christ came the first time he'll
[32:07] come the second time all the things that
[32:09] he said will come to pass and duly
[32:12] seeing this and knowing that where our
[32:15] number is just about to be called as a
[32:17] nation knowing that the church is about
[32:20] to take its rapture it moves a heart of
[32:22] a minister or any of the laity to know
[32:25] that we're in this day and time that
[32:28] we're living it's the greatest time that
[32:30] any person ever lived on the earth is
[32:33] right now that is for the church so I
[32:36] certainly desire your prayers and then I
[32:38] seen in the tabernacle and I've seen if
[32:42] it was going to have some re-elections
[32:45] and everything in the church or some of
[32:48] the board and so forth and so and the
[32:51] church needs a little meeting a little
[32:52] stirring and you've always been kind to
[32:56] me and bless me and my made
[32:59] years seem has been a blessing to you
[33:01] and I'm sure to be with you has been a
[33:03] blessing to me and you've always
[33:05] accepted what I said to be the truth as
[33:08] I've seen it through God and I
[33:10] appreciate that so then I started in and
[33:14] then was to find out and get to a church
[33:18] straighten up in its boards and then for
[33:20] the elections and so forth and then then
[33:24] I thought after that I went out got a
[33:26] little rest before I go back on the
[33:28] field again keep it among yourselves now
[33:30] it's not for outsiders it's far this
[33:32] Tabernacle we want a meeting but this
[33:35] Tabernacle so that everything and every
[33:38] mistake all things has been carrying on
[33:41] and maybe little feelings from one to
[33:43] another those I'm going to get every one
[33:46] of them bring them right face to face so
[33:48] if you don't want to face it you better
[33:49] leave the country cause you're coming
[33:51] face to face with every bit of it like
[33:53] we used to do here at the tabernacle and
[33:55] all of these foods out because we are
[33:57] brothers and sister who's broke
[33:59] communion the body of Christ across the
[34:01] table of blessings and there's nothing
[34:04] but the devil would make anything that
[34:06] would be wrong and would cause feelings
[34:08] or tear up or anything like that and
[34:10] taking our brother Neville and we're
[34:12] going from place to place and bring
[34:13] people to people together for the old
[34:16] Tabernacle is back established again on
[34:19] its feet to go along for the kingdom of
[34:21] God now this is reason I said this is
[34:23] because it was our own little group here
[34:25] this morning and I'm going to give some
[34:27] rest and get back just as quick as I can
[34:29] then I expect to leave to the field
[34:31] again and this time the Lord willing I
[34:34] want to take what little we have
[34:36] accumulated and funds and so forth
[34:38] myself out in the this foreign mission
[34:41] program and get me a new tent and some
[34:44] new equipment and star on the field up
[34:47] from church to church but they're going
[34:49] in our own meetings now not no
[34:51] disregarding two brethren who has
[34:53] invited me which is wonderful but most
[34:56] all of it you find out these conventions
[34:58] they say you're going to be there and
[35:00] then all your friends come in and then
[35:01] it's a whole lot of big drumming for
[35:03] money just dreams those people down I
[35:05] just begin to find that out to see so
[35:07] that's that's not right we want to have
[35:10] a place where we can bring them you
[35:11] don't have
[35:12] bring your money just come along
[35:13] yourself and and serve the Lord's here
[35:16] and so now in my ministry is taking a
[35:20] change right now you remember when I
[35:22] used to take a whole the person's hand
[35:24] just stand there and the Lord but tell
[35:26] me what was their trouble said then it
[35:28] would come to pass you know the secret
[35:29] of the heart of the people every one of
[35:31] you know that's happened just perfectly
[35:33] the way it said now this is the next
[35:35] step which has been prophesied and
[35:37] foretold which is gonna be far beyond
[35:40] any other it you see and it's write down
[35:42] the change and that's reason Satan Spike
[35:45] Lee with the income-tax trying to tell
[35:47] me that a government I only income tax
[35:49] on every penny I've taken up as a
[35:51] minister since 27 years or going into
[35:54] the ministry it's not so-called
[35:58] surpassed in the church I am the trustee
[36:01] of this church that's exactly right it's
[36:03] on the records here so then if I am the
[36:06] trustee treasurer of this church and
[36:08] there's nothing the world government
[36:10] don't have nothing to do with that
[36:11] they're not question the church they're
[36:13] question me being the treasurer of the
[36:15] church and the trustee is assigned a
[36:17] paper that's in the bank under that all
[36:19] my funds instead of having a foundation
[36:21] of my own passed it through my church
[36:24] here because it's automatically a
[36:26] foundation anyhow and to do that helps
[36:29] me to keep them running away from the
[36:31] church and leaving going on out and
[36:32] being nothing here after I promised the
[36:34] people that I would return to the church
[36:36] time after time and help them that's
[36:38] reason I kept it like that because I
[36:40] made a promise to you people that's why
[36:42] I stay with it that way instead of
[36:44] having a individual thing to do that
[36:45] just throws it to an organization and
[36:47] I'm firmly against organization so I
[36:50] keep it just the way it is in the hands
[36:52] of God so that we can move on to the
[36:54] kingdom of God now this morning we want
[36:59] to study this blessed old word and
[37:04] believe that I want to say too I see
[37:07] brother Eagan and many of some of the
[37:09] trustees sitting here actually had our
[37:11] trustee meeting the other night it is
[37:14] true publicly before the church that
[37:16] each one of y'all are no longer
[37:19] appointed trustees you are in lek
[37:22] kid trustees and your name is on the
[37:24] books all right and now they're going to
[37:27] have some more election of Deacons and
[37:29] so forth and brother Neville is will be
[37:32] calling those and meetly after this
[37:34] service all right for the treasurer and
[37:36] so forth as we set the church up get it
[37:38] all the backgrounds ready then we have a
[37:40] revival as it comes on now just before
[37:44] we turn back to the pages here for our
[37:48] Sunday School lesson through this great
[37:50] Word of the Living God let us just bow
[37:54] our heads a few moments as we speak to
[37:56] the author of this book and I'll lay
[38:01] aside every thought everything that's
[38:04] contrary to keep you from having a
[38:07] blessing let's pray
[38:10] most holy and righteous God into the
[38:16] Blessed August presence we come now
[38:20] offering to thee our lives and our our
[38:24] souls and our bodies and our services
[38:28] and our talents all that we have we
[38:32] present them to thee and as you look
[38:37] upon us Lord if there is any sin naked
[38:42] and unconfessed we would ask the old
[38:46] Lord God that you would apply the blood
[38:49] of thy Son Jesus to such a place for
[38:55] realizing that we and ourselves are
[38:58] insufficient and there it is impossible
[39:04] for us to ever be self-sustaining but we
[39:09] rely completely upon his precious blood
[39:12] and His grace to apply to our account
[39:19] that we unworthy sinners might come
[39:24] boldly someday into that presence
[39:27] bringing before us this blood of the
[39:31] Lord Jesus which that are in the time
[39:35] past has recognized that to be the blood
[39:39] of thy only begotten son and has made
[39:42] the promise that through him if we
[39:44] confess our sins we shall be justified
[39:47] by His grace and now we would ask Lord
[39:52] that you would forgive us of any
[39:54] mistakes any sin of just pass our
[39:58] omission transgression that of any evil
[40:02] thought as a pierced are sold by the
[40:05] fiery darts of the devil that you would
[40:09] drive away this evil enemy of mine and
[40:13] of thy people and we would ask that you
[40:17] would send the Holy Spirit to take hold
[40:21] of the word at this time as we yield
[40:24] ourselves as instruments that you would
[40:28] speak to us and hear through us thy word
[40:33] and may we in return receive it as from
[40:37] thee and leave this place today feeling
[40:41] that we have been readjusted to the
[40:45] cause of Christ that we might be better
[40:50] fit for the service of tonight and
[40:53] tomorrow because of the visitation of
[40:56] the Holy Spirit that's our brethren
[41:00] everywhere the churches across the world
[41:04] whose holding forth the word of life in
[41:07] this evil day we feel that there is not
[41:11] much time left to work or the night is
[41:15] swiftly coming the war clouds are
[41:18] floating again evil is at hand and we
[41:24] pray that you'll let us work as never
[41:27] before
[41:28] rest our tired bodies Lord send us back
[41:34] into the battle or we asked it in the
[41:38] name of the Lord Jesus and for his sake
[41:42] we pray amen
[41:45] as we open this morning the Bible to the
[41:54] 11th chapter of the book of Hebrews
[41:57] Wednesday night we were speaking on the
[42:01] seventh chapter of the book of Hebrews
[42:03] of Melchizedek being without father
[42:09] without mother without beginning of days
[42:12] are ending of life and I thought maybe
[42:17] this morning it would be appropriate to
[42:20] open again this wonderful book being
[42:23] that we have the backgrounds to what we
[42:25] wish to stay in the farmer readings and
[42:30] skipping over the tenth chapter in the
[42:33] ninth chapter which is the sacrificial
[42:35] laws we would come into a spot of faith
[42:39] and here in the book of Hebrews the
[42:45] eleventh chapter and beginning with the
[42:47] 23rd verse we read it like this by faith
[42:53] Moses when he was born was hid three
[42:57] months of his parents because they saw
[43:00] he was a proper child and they were not
[43:04] afraid of the Kings commandment by faith
[43:10] Moses when he came to years refused to
[43:15] be called the son of Pharaoh's daughter
[43:17] choosing rather to suffer the affliction
[43:24] with the people of God than to enjoy the
[43:28] pleasures of sin for a season esteeming
[43:34] the reproach of Christ greater riches
[43:37] than the treasures of Egypt and had
[43:45] recompense unto the reward by faith he
[43:49] forsook Egypt not fearing the wrath of
[43:53] the King for he endured as seeing him
[43:57] who is invisibly I want to take the
[44:04] subject this morning choosing by faith
[44:08] now I want to take for a text the first
[44:12] three words of the 23rd chapter by faith
[44:20] Moses and choosing by faith most
[44:27] everything that we do we have to choose
[44:30] by faith and all that we find that Moses
[44:36] did that's worth repeating was by faith
[44:41] not by sight but by faith and the reason
[44:48] I have selected this this morning for
[44:50] the church in this state has been that
[44:54] in ours even our schools and around we
[44:58] have said so much of scientific teaching
[45:03] because of this we have drawn the people
[45:07] away from faith now faith is not proved
[45:12] by science faith is what science doesn't
[45:17] see and we if we ever lose this great
[45:23] faith then we are totally in darkness
[45:29] yet no matter how well we are educated
[45:33] how we could explain the Word of God to
[45:38] suit our own way of believing there is
[45:42] no way to ever please God only by faith
[45:47] the scripture plainly states it that way
[45:51] and it's by faith and without faith says
[45:57] the scripture it is impossible to please
[46:02] God so if faith disagrees with science
[46:08] and
[46:09] science disagrees with faith that put
[46:13] standard at age at each other then we
[46:17] must take a choice as Moses did by faith
[46:23] we believe now if we loose faith then we
[46:29] will never get a prayer answered by God
[46:33] for he that cometh to God must first
[46:37] believe that he is and a rewarder of
[46:41] those that diligently seek after him so
[46:45] if we lose faith our prayers are on all
[46:50] we get nowhere so it's all that we can
[46:57] think of this morning is to hold on to
[47:00] faith then if we lose faith all our
[47:05] hopes is gone and if we lose faith all
[47:11] our spiritual reality is gone or you
[47:17] cannot have faith in things that you see
[47:22] for the things that you see are all
[47:25] perishable if we look at some great
[47:31] person a great minister are a great
[47:35] congregation they will all perish
[47:40] someday and if we look at a great nation
[47:45] our great weapon they'll all perish
[47:49] someday and then we must live by faith
[47:55] of those things that science does not
[47:58] declare it's by faith that we believe
[48:04] now we lose our glory if we lose faith
[48:10] now if we get away from faith then we
[48:14] take the church into an intellectual
[48:16] ground and many times that's been
[48:21] thought
[48:22] most people that because a congregation
[48:26] was large and they had great churches
[48:34] great steeples and the great lot of well
[48:39] dressed and groomed people's and a lot
[48:43] of finances that they could afford such
[48:47] things we many times thought that was
[48:51] inspiring that this certain church must
[48:55] be inspired or we've often referred to
[49:00] different ministers who get out on the
[49:03] field and have gray galleries of crowds
[49:06] and we think sometimes that they are the
[49:11] signs of inspiration but that's not
[49:15] altogether the truth that's human
[49:19] inspiration but the real inspiration
[49:23] comes by doing the will of God the
[49:27] whether it is at one are just a handful
[49:32] whether it is a big church are a small
[49:36] church it matters not whether he is a
[49:40] great eloquent speaker are just a man
[49:43] that hardly knows his ABCs it doesn't
[49:47] matter it depends on the message that
[49:50] he's breathe whether it is inspired by
[49:54] the Word of God our isn't inspired by
[49:58] intellectual conceptions of human
[50:01] inspiration some people can be inspired
[50:04] because of an eloquent speaker that
[50:08] doesn't make it right sometimes are
[50:11] inspired because the man is so trained
[50:13] Deegan putty spawn over that doesn't
[50:16] mean that it's of God the it's only two
[50:21] God's everlasting eternal blessed word
[50:25] can we receive inspiration and that's
[50:28] given by the Holy Ghost by faith we
[50:33] receive it
[50:34] now we would think of Moses and this
[50:38] great time of his life and we read back
[50:43] up his birth and how that God had cared
[50:47] for him but there come a time in Moses
[50:52] life to where there had to be a choosing
[50:56] time if we read right we find out that
[51:00] he was the son of Pharaoh's daughter and
[51:04] was the heir to the throne and would
[51:08] have been the next Pharaoh in Egypt
[51:12] don't he would notice as he looked
[51:17] around after he come of age and other
[51:20] countability and that would be those
[51:24] slaves working out of the slime pits and
[51:30] Moses as he looked through the windows
[51:33] of the palace of all the same slaves
[51:38] that payroll looked down but what a
[51:44] difference there was in the looking I
[51:49] want to base that thought this morning
[51:52] for a few minutes and may the God of
[51:56] heaven drive it home to Everhart here
[52:00] it's how you look at anything what makes
[52:04] the difference yes the gate evangelist
[52:10] John SPRO which was a convert of brother
[52:13] Bosworth ministry who many of you
[52:16] remember years ago of the Old Glory bar
[52:19] he said one day he was taking a tip
[52:22] before the deceased the obvious beloved
[52:25] companion and wife they were in La Salle
[52:30] Lorraine's France and I had the
[52:33] privilege of visits in the same place
[52:35] and the guide was taking them out
[52:39] through the gardens and showing them
[52:41] different things and they come upon a
[52:45] certain statue of
[52:47] Lord Jesus the crucifixion and mr.
[52:51] Sproule was standing off looking at it
[52:53] he and his wife and in their hearts were
[52:56] criticizing what the artist must have
[53:00] had in mind are the sculpture rather
[53:02] when he hewed out of a stone such a hard
[53:07] one looking fain to be to represent the
[53:10] suffering and the love and the pity of
[53:14] the Lord Jesus and how it was all
[53:19] crudely and chopped up looking and the
[53:24] guide came to mr. Sproule and he said
[53:26] sir I suppose that you are criticizing
[53:30] this statue of the Lord Jesus and he
[53:37] said I am and he said I am NOT a bit
[53:41] surprised because most people that look
[53:44] at it first they do criticize it and mr.
[53:49] Sproule said but I can't see any pity or
[53:53] any inspiration from looking at such a
[53:57] thing so I'm wondering why the sculpture
[54:01] every made it like this and the
[54:07] sculpture said mr. stone this statues
[54:12] all right and the sculpture had the
[54:16] right thing in his mind but where the
[54:21] trouble is is with you it's the way
[54:26] you're looking at it and he took he and
[54:31] his wife by the hand and led them down
[54:33] to a altar at the foot of this said
[54:37] cross and he said now mr. Sproule look
[54:42] up now and when he looked up he said his
[54:46] heart like Jim failed him what a
[54:50] difference it was to spend off there and
[54:53] look at it that way and you
[54:56] then look at it the way that it was made
[54:59] to look at and that's the way that God
[55:04] is that's the way that faith is it's the
[55:09] way you look at it if you look at it as
[55:14] some sort of a historical Bible of
[55:19] something that was in the days gone by
[55:23] you will never be able to get the real
[55:27] value of the Bible you are supposed to
[55:32] get on your knees
[55:34] and obey the commandments of this Bible
[55:38] and look at it to the eyes of the Holy
[55:42] Spirit I would ask this audience this
[55:47] morning what good does a historical God
[55:50] do us today if he isn't the same God
[55:55] what good doesn't God that would take
[55:59] Moses and do the miracles within that he
[56:03] did what good for to do us the read of
[56:06] such a God if he isn't the same one
[56:09] today what good is a God that could
[56:14] deliver from the fiery furnace the
[56:16] Hebrew children if he isn't the same gun
[56:19] today what good is a God that would
[56:25] judge between right and wrong in a day
[56:28] gone by and British the wrong and bless
[56:31] the right if he isn't the same God today
[56:34] what do we go to church father body
[56:38] we've stained from things of the world
[56:41] if he isn't the same God of the same
[56:44] judgment and the same opinion that he
[56:47] always was what good would it be for God
[56:51] who could touch a woman's hand with a
[56:54] raging fever and the fever stopped he
[57:00] isn't the same God today
[57:05] what good will be the serve of God who
[57:08] could call his friend from a grave after
[57:10] being dead for days if he isn't the same
[57:14] God today our faith we believe that some
[57:20] glorious day he shall call us from the
[57:23] earth shall we be a spoonful of ashes
[57:26] again how do we prove it we do not prove
[57:31] it we believe it we're not asked to
[57:35] prove anything we're asked you'd believe
[57:37] it
[57:38] by faith Moses did such and such and as
[57:45] Moses as a young man looked through the
[57:48] palace winter at the srage he saw the
[57:53] same bunch of grabbing dirty mop ridden
[57:59] slaves at Pharaoh's saw and when Pharaoh
[58:04] looked upon him in the Egyptians they
[58:07] wasn't nothing but a bunch of slaves
[58:10] that's all they were good for just to be
[58:14] human mud dobbers to make money bricks
[58:18] for the benefit of the cities that
[58:22] payroll was building that's the way more
[58:27] of the Egyptians and they roll look at
[58:30] the slaves but Moses when he looked at
[58:37] him it was a different look Moses head
[58:42] when he's seen passing by the window the
[58:48] great ditches in their face but tears
[58:53] that run down their cheeks enter the
[58:57] bodies he looked upon them and the
[59:02] people of God he didn't look upon his
[59:09] slaves
[59:11] he looked upon as the chosen people of
[59:15] God though I go about from country to
[59:21] country and from nation to nation
[59:25] preaching then sound left the doors of
[59:30] this little tabernacle
[59:32] that's an interdenominational
[59:33] institution but no law but love no book
[59:38] but the Bible in old treatment Christ
[59:41] I've tried to look upon God's children
[59:46] but upon the rejected and being got
[59:51] chosen and elected people I don't ask
[59:55] them if they've gone to the banham
[59:57] tabernacle I don't ask them if they're
[1:00:00] Methodist sorry if there are
[1:00:01] Presbyterians or if they are
[1:00:04] Pentecostals our Nazarenes are pilgrim
[1:00:09] Holiness I just spoke to look up public
[1:00:14] health of people of God I'm seeing their
[1:00:18] doings in their sessions that they are
[1:00:21] the servants of the Lord God and my
[1:00:25] heart desires fellowship with them no
[1:00:29] matter what brand they got I just long
[1:00:33] for their fellowship I love them
[1:00:38] because I know they are people of God
[1:00:42] we're gonna see a woman coming down the
[1:00:46] street with the long skirt her hair done
[1:00:51] up neatly in the back end and a
[1:00:53] decent-looking vests on and I see
[1:00:57] another young lady maybe their same age
[1:01:01] with a little parish charts home she may
[1:01:05] be in looks twice as pity as a woman
[1:01:09] with the long hair according to the
[1:01:11] looking of the world but I can't
[1:01:13] shut up with that girl that's dress like
[1:01:17] a Christian though they'd be laughing at
[1:01:22] her and calling her a fanatic yet I take
[1:01:26] my side she might not be as pretty as
[1:01:30] the other girl feature Lee but she sees
[1:01:33] something bad faith she sees him who is
[1:01:38] invisible who is guiding her life when I
[1:01:42] see the man on the job being called
[1:01:45] deacon or feature are automatic because
[1:01:52] he refuses to smoke and to drink beer
[1:01:57] and to go to dances like the rest of
[1:02:00] them and he's called a fanatic our heart
[1:02:04] goes out for him he is my brother
[1:02:10] that alone in this Egypt's oils that
[1:02:14] makes our heart long to him brace him
[1:02:18] and say brother we are pilgrims and
[1:02:23] strangers of this land and I long to
[1:02:26] fellowship with you
[1:02:29] mowers has had to make a choice choosing
[1:02:34] my faith how many young men would have
[1:02:39] jumped at the opportunity to become the
[1:02:43] son of Pharaoh's daughter how many young
[1:02:48] men would have jumped at the opportunity
[1:02:51] that Moses had to enjoy all the
[1:02:55] pleasures and the glamour of the world
[1:03:01] to become the king of Egypt then the
[1:03:06] whole world at his feet what a foolish
[1:03:10] thing that the young man of his days
[1:03:14] must've thought when Moses chose to
[1:03:17] think is place with the affected and
[1:03:21] suffering people of God
[1:03:25] [Applause]
[1:03:26] why did he do it by faith when he lifted
[1:03:32] up his eyes he looked beyond the grammar
[1:03:36] of this world even beyond the pleasures
[1:03:42] of sin and the Bible said that he
[1:03:45] endured as seeing him who was invisible
[1:03:48] by faith and he made a choice served
[1:03:53] that God regardless of what took place
[1:03:59] it has not changed many of us could go
[1:04:04] to what we would call a better building
[1:04:08] we could enjoy it maybe the fellowship
[1:04:12] and pleasures of setting in a better Pew
[1:04:17] we might be more popular to drink and to
[1:04:21] smoke and to desin to like the world but
[1:04:26] what's the matter you've lifted up your
[1:04:29] eyes by the faith you see him who is
[1:04:33] invisible and a tough your stand with
[1:04:36] the rejected and so-called holy rulers
[1:04:39] of the day bar by faith we see him who
[1:04:44] is invisible choosing to suffer the
[1:04:49] persecutions and the affections I
[1:04:53] wouldn't say to people that they should
[1:04:55] choose to be afflicted I don't say that
[1:05:00] you should choose suffering it would not
[1:05:02] be the human thing to do but if
[1:05:05] suffering lays in the path of Duty then

[1:06:10] saw the sufferings of the people he knew
[1:06:12] what the price was to pay but by faith
[1:06:15] he chosen rather than to have the
[1:06:19] pleasures of seeing is maybe a little

[1:07:59] believe our faith Moses did and in this
[1:08:05] faith walk there comes a time there has
[1:08:08] to be a choice Locke made that sadness
[1:08:14] faith that we make a lot of times we
[1:08:18] choose for our own good we choose things
[1:08:22] that would be a better sometimes it's a
[1:08:25] little squabble come from the church and
[1:08:27] someone would say well the deacon are
[1:08:30] the pastor's on this side don't look at
[1:08:34] that look at what's righteous get that
[1:08:38] thing out and bring up all together
[1:08:39] that's lovely
[1:08:43] there's a choosing and we choose for
[1:08:47] ourselves we choose something is for our
[1:08:49] own good but Moses chose the affections
[1:08:53] and the disgrace that he might walk with
[1:08:56] the people of God think of it now listen
[1:09:01] to me chose the afflictions of the
[1:09:04] people of God and counted at a greater
[1:09:06] treasure or he endured seeing him who
[1:09:09] was invisible II know lot one time had
[1:09:15] to make a choice and it made me this
[1:09:19] morning that there will be many women
[1:09:23] sitting here that'll make your final
[1:09:26] choice you are today what you are
[1:09:31] because several years ago you chose to
[1:09:34] be what you are now and what you
[1:09:37] choose now will determine what you'll be
[1:09:39] five years from today of yours today you
[1:09:43] may be a missionary five years today you
[1:09:45] may be a renowned Christian our five
[1:09:48] years today who may be in hell because
[1:09:51] you make the wrong decision five years
[1:09:54] today you may be cleanest pick tunes in
[1:09:56] a barroom five years today may be a
[1:09:59] prostitute on the street are you may be
[1:10:03] a maid or whether that's a that's a
[1:10:06] credit to any society the cause of your
[1:10:09] choice for Christ five years today you
[1:10:13] may be in glory gone in the rapture
[1:10:16] because you made your choice today but
[1:10:18] you've got to choose and don't look at
[1:10:20] what you see choose what you see by
[1:10:23] faith that's the only thing that will
[1:10:27] count is what you choose by faith look
[1:10:32] as he had to make a choice
[1:10:35] Abraham give not his choice and God
[1:10:39] gives you your choice choose you this
[1:10:43] day whom ye shall serve in the Garden of
[1:10:46] Eden there was a tree of knowledge and a
[1:10:49] tree of life man was given the privilege
[1:10:51] to choose either one he desired and so
[1:10:55] is it today you're giving your privilege
[1:10:58] as free moral agents to choose whatever
[1:11:02] you want to choose my advice to you is
[1:11:06] don't look at the modern things around
[1:11:08] you and the popularity and the glamour
[1:11:10] that you could be but choose right by
[1:11:15] faith him that give the promise that
[1:11:17] someday he will come and will write in
[1:11:22] all wrongs and go give you eternal life
[1:11:25] and raise you up don't matter if you
[1:11:28] take the despised way with the Lord you
[1:11:30] make that choice if there's troubles in
[1:11:35] the hand if there are troubles in the
[1:11:37] land if there's troubles in the church
[1:11:38] if there are troubles in the home no
[1:11:42] matter where it is
[1:11:43] make your choice by faith I'll serve God
[1:11:48] I'll humble my heart and his presence
[1:11:51] I'll take the way with God's children
[1:11:53] I'll see them despised and rejected and
[1:11:57] drove out and make father still take my
[1:12:00] post of duty I'll stay right by and when
[1:12:04] they crowd crowd with them and when
[1:12:08] their sorrow I feel sorrow with them the
[1:12:12] way they live I'll live like me one with
[1:12:15] cetera said to me oh my your ways beat
[1:12:20] my ways my ways be your ways where you
[1:12:23] live I live where you go I'll go let God
[1:12:27] that you serve be my god take that
[1:12:31] choice though it pulls a very skin off
[1:12:34] of your conscience I'm thinking it
[1:12:37] you're somebody skin yourself down and
[1:12:41] take your away with the Lord's dis past
[1:12:43] you and stay lying on the field of
[1:12:48] service and have the post of Duty not
[1:12:53] looked around he said I got a choice and
[1:12:56] he looked towards Sun he saw the good
[1:13:01] grassy fields were better than what
[1:13:04] Abraham saw and where Abraham was he saw
[1:13:09] the opportunities to graze his cattle
[1:13:11] that have fatter and better cattle I
[1:13:16] hope I'm not hurting anyone's feeling
[1:13:20] but that's been to stand up to many
[1:13:23] preachers the compromise with the gospel
[1:13:29] bacon if they get more money out of it
[1:13:36] [Applause]
[1:13:38] soda crackers then a compromise upon the
[1:13:42] condition of my faith in the Word of the
[1:13:45] Living God
[1:13:46] I'll take it away I'm upset Billy
[1:13:50] what's a night with your meeting as
[1:13:52] there's too many Pentecostals had a
[1:13:55] great denominational minister said that
[1:13:58] I said with your denomination sponsor my
[1:14:01] meeting not long ago in the Look
[1:14:05] magazine I believe there was an article
[1:14:07] and the writer centers talked about the
[1:14:11] Pentecostal people he said the
[1:14:14] Pentecostal church is the fastest
[1:14:16] growing Church in the world today why
[1:14:20] it's because men and women has raised up
[1:14:23] their eyes and the far off and the
[1:14:28] writer also complimented the Pentecostal
[1:14:30] people oh of course they said there were
[1:14:32] some of them went radical and so forth
[1:14:34] but the Methodists worship accreted they
[1:14:37] worship God by Creed the Baptist does
[1:14:40] the same in the Presbyterians but the
[1:14:42] Pentecostal worships by his Bible faith
[1:14:47] we see the promise I'll take my luck
[1:14:52] with them no matter how much they're
[1:14:54] despised I still wear them though they
[1:14:59] be made fun of it Heather ups and downs
[1:15:01] as Israel did I'll never want to spin
[1:15:04] with the false prophet on the hillside a
[1:15:08] bailment and try to curse what God has
[1:15:12] blessed because in that cape is a
[1:15:15] smitten rock and a bloody sacrifice I'm
[1:15:20] a pillar of fire no matter what there in
[1:15:23] its leading I'm home to victory and
[1:15:25] there got to come to it because they are
[1:15:27] the promised people that's walking path
[1:15:29] faith though they be not of the
[1:15:32] denomination they were wanders around
[1:15:33] and so as the people of God I don't want
[1:15:36] to take my way with him join up with
[1:15:39] them and their ranks not in their
[1:15:41] denomination but in their fellowship
[1:15:44] around the articles of God's eternal
[1:15:47] spirit which by faith I have received
[1:15:50] the baptism of the Holy Ghost god help
[1:15:54] you to always have an attitude
[1:15:57] notice as they moved on we find it
[1:16:03] locked
[1:16:04] tell the opportunities or a fatted
[1:16:07] cattle many see the opportunities of a
[1:16:11] fatted popular many seize the
[1:16:13] opportunities of a better social
[1:16:15] standing
[1:16:17] he saw the possibilities of a few extra
[1:16:20] dollars he saw the possibilities of
[1:16:23] being the mayor of the city being a
[1:16:26] stranger in a pretty smart man as he was
[1:16:28] maybe I will become the chief man of the
[1:16:31] city he saw the possibilities because
[1:16:34] they were laying before him but he did
[1:16:38] not see the fire that was to destroy
[1:16:42] them and he did not reconcile himself
[1:16:47] that the land was full of sin and God
[1:16:50] had to destroy it
[1:16:52] today people try to reconcile himself a
[1:16:54] same are you austere here Christian they
[1:16:56] said I'm an American that has the more
[1:17:00] to do with it or try to say to her
[1:17:02] crony was a frog it has nothing to do
[1:17:05] with it
[1:17:07] she's going to be this tribe that cause
[1:17:10] god it just and if America gets by with
[1:17:14] her since the Justin's sovereign holy
[1:17:17] God will be duty-bound to resurrect
[1:17:20] solving amore and apologize to them or
[1:17:23] bring them up because of their sin he
[1:17:27] lets us get by with it if he lets you
[1:17:30] get the heaven on your injustice works
[1:17:36] you'll have to raise up paradise and
[1:17:39] survive and give them another
[1:17:40] opportunity certain evil but he just and
[1:17:47] another source money here solve past
[1:17:52] oh my didn't see the destruction of he's
[1:18:00] shuddered in that place many of you
[1:18:03] holding around these old formal Creed's
[1:18:05] and things you don't see the juvenile
[1:18:07] delinquency and the destruction of your
[1:18:09] children you don't see your daughter in
[1:18:12] a prostitute house you don't see her son
[1:18:15] a drunkard I had a card table somewhere
[1:18:17] because she's well watered and sand is
[1:18:21] not touched he didn't see his wife the
[1:18:27] head of all the societies turned to a
[1:18:28] pillar of salt when he was looking he
[1:18:32] didn't see him escaping a homey father
[1:18:34] edge of his teeth to a little city
[1:18:37] somewhere for his life he didn't see
[1:18:39] that because he only looked at what he
[1:18:41] saw in front of him but Abraham he
[1:18:48] didn't notice the well for her land for
[1:18:51] he lifted up his eyes and saw the
[1:18:54] tomorrow or he had inherit all think
[1:18:58] he's the real Christian today lifts up
[1:19:02] his eyes and sees the promise of Christ
[1:19:04] blessed are the meek for they shall
[1:19:06] inherit all whole thing they shot the
[1:19:11] real fish in my faith looks up and sees
[1:19:14] that call him what you want to he lifted
[1:19:18] up his eyes and when he did that God
[1:19:22] said Abraham walk to the land she's all
[1:19:24] yours a faith Abraham did this the same
[1:19:31] faith that Moses had it was rock the one
[1:19:35] commentator that said this now I've
[1:19:37] thought of his most beautiful words but
[1:19:40] Abraham Moses took the best out of the
[1:19:45] world and put it in one scale and the
[1:19:49] worst out religion and put it in the
[1:19:51] other scale and the worst out religion
[1:19:54] outweighed the best
[1:19:56] the world so is it the case that if we
[1:20:01] be called anything we want to be called
[1:20:03] fanatics are the violent healers our
[1:20:05] Holy Roller whatever they wanted to call
[1:20:07] the worst that we are outweigh the best
[1:20:11] the world can afford wanna be called
[1:20:15] old-fashioned old fogey fanatic
[1:20:18] it'll outweigh the best pain that the
[1:20:21] devil's got to offer Oh surely Moses a
[1:20:29] speeding the reproach of Christ before
[1:20:32] Saul cries later he spoke some mighty
[1:20:35] inspiring words about him
[1:20:37] may the Lord your God shall rise up a
[1:20:39] prophet like unto me the newest foresaw
[1:20:44] and an esteemed his reproach greater
[1:20:48] riches than all the glamour of the world
[1:20:52] Christian friend today Cates you do that
[1:20:55] but all the glamour and popularity the
[1:20:58] world the faith we see him who promised
[1:21:01] and the worst of the church today in all
[1:21:05] of its condition yet it'll outweigh
[1:21:07] everything the devil can offer you if we
[1:21:11] are torn up that we are go to pieces
[1:21:13] then we are confused and broke up in
[1:21:16] denominations of fanaticism it will
[1:21:18] outweigh anything that devil can offer
[1:21:20] you certainly he esteem the reproach of
[1:21:25] Christ greater riches and all the
[1:21:28] treasures of Egypt then he had to do
[1:21:31] something
[1:21:32] he forsook Egypt oh I love that word he
[1:21:38] forsook Egypt he he was looking through
[1:21:41] the same window but he was looking
[1:21:44] different from failure what a pharaoh
[1:21:45] conceit he's in what a pharaoh would
[1:21:47] have seen his nation grounded moses saw
[1:21:50] how by science ah faith focuses on
[1:21:56] everything that he did was by faith
[1:21:59] because God promised Abraham father that
[1:22:05] he would he would visit the station at
[1:22:07] your for hundred years and would bring
[1:22:08] an iron Bob
[1:22:09] Moses disease the word that God said and
[1:22:13] note himself and my faith to be the
[1:22:15] chosen leader to bring them out he knew
[1:22:18] where he was he took his place in the
[1:22:21] slab pits as a mud dauber Canada
[1:22:26] reproach of Christ greater riches than
[1:22:28] the settling of tone of each he took he
[1:22:32] never instead I sympathize with him he
[1:22:34] took their place and went with them he
[1:22:41] took their place we went with them oh
[1:22:45] one of the inspired writers I'll take
[1:22:49] the way with the Lords despise you
[1:22:53] Oh starting with Jesus I'm going through
[1:22:58] I'm on my way to Caitlyn sure Moses it
[1:23:07] was said by one that Moses had rather
[1:23:13] but he could have been the son of pyram
[1:23:16] I have a glamour of the world he had
[1:23:19] rather be a son of Abraham than to be
[1:23:23] the son of payroll the son of Abraham
[1:23:26] the despised than to be son of fatal of
[1:23:29] the king I'm going to be the son of the
[1:23:32] Lord Jesus and his fellow servants and
[1:23:35] take my place with the rejected people
[1:23:37] of this world and to be president of
[1:23:40] this great United States of America are
[1:23:43] to be an Elvis Presley or Pat Boone or
[1:23:46] whoever you want to make it I'll take my
[1:23:49] way young ladies or to take their way

[1:24:03] I'd rather be a preacher in the pulpit
[1:24:06] preaching the unsearchable riches of
[1:24:09] Christ than to be a Hollywood movie star
[1:24:11] or the greatest person on the earth if I
[1:24:14] had to eat beggar whatever I do
[1:24:17] I'll take my way with the Lord

[1:25:39] right to fear the wrath he had a right
[1:25:42] to fear the wrath of the king but he
[1:25:43] didn't he did not do it because he had a

[1:32:51] forth do not let those seeds of thy word
[1:32:57] Lord fall upon the stony ground do not
[1:33:02] let the message Lord fall in briars
[1:33:06] thorns that the cares of this life like
[1:33:10] lot might choke it out to the end become
[1:33:15] a castaway but all blessed God let it
[1:33:21] fall on good fertile grounds on penitent
[1:33:24] hearts and I'll mine also Lord that we
[1:33:30] all might look to God's glass of looking
[1:33:34] and see the rejected Church of the Lord
[1:33:38] Jesus the rejected people they rejected
[1:33:42] way and may we walk in this glorious way
[1:33:46] as Moses he didn't know where he was
[1:33:50] going the people didn't know where they
[1:33:53] were going they didn't know which way to
[1:33:56] go

[1:34:13] Europe won't think of what the world's
[1:34:15] going to say or how they're going may
[1:34:18] they just rise in their spirit and go
[1:34:22] Moses followed the light and it led him
[1:34:29] to the land of promise not knowing where
[1:34:33] he was going but he just walked in the
[1:34:36] line that land that was fairer than day
[1:34:41] grant Lord the day that many here will
[1:34:44] walk in the light of the scripture and
[1:34:47] in the Fellowship of the Holy Ghost and
[1:34:49] with the church the church the first
[1:34:52] barn the new
[1:34:54] horn page that's received Christ had
[1:34:56] been filled with the Holy Ghost led by
[1:34:58] the spirit may we walk in his fellowship
[1:35:01] together around the articles of God
[1:35:05] serving him in baptism in obedience to
[1:35:09] his death burial and resurrection may we
