protection at a bank [Music] robbery uh she walked into the bank the computers crashed sent her to another bank and as soon as she walked in a man walked in dropped the bag behind her and when she turned around she saw him pull the hood over his head and her first reaction was for her but it was for two little babies that were next to her she she grabs them to the ground and lays uh on them and tells them whatever you do don't worry in her mind and out her heart she said the Lord is my shield and simultaneously a man from the other side of the bank started screaming Jesus oh Jesus Jesus by the third time then bank man the bank robber who was waving his gun took off running God was called on a scene that's [Music] why I love him I love him because he for first Lov [Music] me and pous my [Music] salv [Music] on [Music] we welcome everyone tonight I'm nervous as always and uh but I'm more nervous on my for my son because I almost came in with the offering basket started to preach to me that but uh on on the flip side we're all preachers and and it's kind of a problem uh so God bless you let let let me relax a little bit sister's just go and stay for a little bit sister B stay for a little bit okay thank younie uh we sang in English right if you can help me with I'm going to try to sing a couple of chuses in [Music] Spanish it's it's an old time song you can sit down if you want to so you can rest but the course the court I don't know you [Music] know [Applause] a little bit higher little bit higher I think [Music] [Applause] goodah [Music] remember that one sister your dad used to sing that quite a bit I think sure he did no no no Hallelujah and [Music] [Music] amen how many of you like that in Spanish we' like to talk to you a little bit tonight and um if you notice who who the song leader was afternoon my son is St and then my brother's The Interpreter and your truly brother Alex I I I'd like to read a scripture and I and I I'm kind of have a lot of things in my mind if You' like to turn in Jeremiah Jeremiah 8:20 and that way you can help me it's a it's a Deliverance service and I I know you're here one specific person and that's for Jesus Christ and I know you're here because you love the Lord so I'm not going to ask you do you love the Lord I'm not going to ask him I believe you love the Lord by your actions so we're real happy for that you can turn your scriptures 8:20 if you have it can you say amen that's great the Harvest is passed the summer is ended and we're not saved for the hurt of the daughter of my people am I hurt I am black astonishment hath taken Hold On Me is there no bomb in Gilead is there no physician there why then is not the health of the daughter of my people recovered let us pray Lord Jesus we we come to thee tonight Lord Jesus we love you Lord of all we don't know what to do but we love you and we want to praise we want to do right Lord we want to think right we we we want to praise you and and we're here for that purpose Lord Jesus if there's anyone here tonight that has gone wavered as all of us have at one time or another and you've called them to be your son or daughter of God we ask you Lord that be merciful bring them back to the fold and we thank you for your grace for your Amazing Grace and we thank you for your mercy also compassion thank you Lord Jesus we ask you that You' help us tonight we ask it all in your name the Lord Jesus Christ give you the honor and the glory amen thank you Lord it's it's an astonish and it's astonishment to read the scripture if you once you start reading this Bible now I you kind of have to watch what you say because sometimes as people hear you you say when when you read this Bible and it's they're they're thinking about this specific Bible but you have your own Bible and you know that's what I'm talking about and you are a Bible and you're an epistle and God is reading you and God knows all about you for a little bit of a moment I was asked by my grandson why that so I told him I got to take you back before anything happened there in the Garden of Eden before you and I now if this sounds rare that's okay okay I at least I'll get your attention before you or I any of you before even Jesus was here on Earth okay did you did you hear what I just said he knew you and He sent Jesus for one purpose I know that Jesus is multifaceted I know that God is multifaceted I know that but for right now I'm saying that God came for one purpose that came to Die For The Sinner he came to die for you and I he came to die for the bride he came to die for the foolish virgin he came to die for for each and every one of us whether you're a Believer whether you're an unbeliever a make believer whatever kind of believer you are nevertheless God being a merciful judge he did the right thing and he sent his advocate he sent his attorney he sent his only begotten son Jesus Christ brother Bram said that before any of you came even before Jesus but he when he came he died he came back so he and he [Applause] resurrected to give us the Holy Ghost to bring us back wow amen and then Jeremiah the prophet the prophet I believe that the Harvest I know I'm not I'm not going to be able to finish the Harvest is passed I'm sorry it's not finished I read that wrong the Harvest is [Music] passed the summer has ended and we're not saved I believe that the Bride of Jesus Christ presently looking at herself she's looking and she's saying where have I gone wrong I need to wake up I need to start gleaning I need to this bit here this little bit here and find what he said over here and what he said over here I got to make sure because the lovely Ruth that she gleaned The Book of Ruth is in the eth book yes see okay okay sorry about that okay how many of you read your Bible okay you know I I I I love the Bible I sometimes have a hard time understanding what I read but so I go to my dictionary and then I start finding out uh what what the words mean you know Jeremiah himself he he asked the question and there is an answer you know Jeremiah said is there no Bal in Gilead you know where bomb comes from I check check the the dictionaries and bomb is actually is a res that derived from the evergreen tree did you hear what I just said it comes from the evergreen tree it doesn't come from a flower doesn't come from the lily of the valley doesn't come from a rose it comes from the evergreen tree there's only one evergreen tree that I know of that is Jesus Christ it's mentioned there back in Genesis three times and in the Book of Revelation it's mentioned three [Music] times it's the Tree of Life bom is derived from that tree of life Jesus Christ Jesus Christ is our medicine this is our medicine the hardest thing for us is to actually apply it amen how many of you were with me so far very simple is it okay you know I was wondering this is really something you know so I I looked and it says what in order to to get a a health to get healthy and and and most of the doctors I think they'll agree with me and agree with the Bible you need a remedy sometimes to to to help you so we go back to our dictionary we find out and we find that that remedy you take the word the word remedy is a noun a noun is a person it's a person place or thing okay something that cures or relieves a disease or bodily order a healing medicine now I'm going to not read the rest of the definitions but I'm just going to uh stick with this right here a healing medicine is a remedy how many of you agree with that okay it could be a pill it could be an injection it could be a bomb it could be anything like that but it's a a remedy now this remedy it's no good at all unless you apply it you have to apply it now my son if I am sick if I'm very sick and and I don't know what to do the doctor says you know Alex you got to take this medicine and you're G to be well and and if he takes the medicine for me am I going to get well no absolutely no because the medicine was made for me this medicine this Bible is meant for you and me it'll save you it'll heal you amen wow but you have to apply it okay now this other word it's going to get kind of I'll use the word dicey a remedy is a healing medicine it's an application or treatment you notice what I do I I'm sorry but I got kind of used to this in the prison sorry about that guys okay forgive now I'm going to treat this sick person here he just came off the street okay he just came off the street ad he's lost and but but he this day he Bo he looks he looks like he could passor a maybe a movie star or hman or something like that and if I go to him and I go good to have you here in church today okay so I just gave him a treatment I treated him how many understood that okay another scenario here he is poor drug addict you know he's all strung out I'm sorry guys but look I'm not playing games okay I'm not playing games this morning a black car dropped off one of our brothers here brother Alex is all over the place except where there's money but anyway he's all over the place he sees everything he's strung out he was strung out he was strung out and I'm sure one of the sisters saw her and I'm not going to go into but instead of be telling hey man what's wrong with you so I just tell him let's see if can let's see if you can they can find you a place kind of right now but let's see if they can find you a place so what I did I gave him baling Gilead I I gave him a treatment okay you and I have to give a treatment but before you can give somebody a treatment you have to give yourself first a treatment you have to feed yourself with food to be able to have strength to get up and fight them maggots out there fight those bad people out there fight the devil to fight the whatever but you have to feed yourself first of nourishment you have to eat something and then after you do that you have to eat this kind of medicine and then you can apply the treatment the remedy and then you can treat now guess where you have to start anybody here care care to uh I'm start with the brother where would we start brother it's not a trick question no okay I'll give you the answer I'm I'm just trying to get you to understand the treatment when you become a doctor oh boy here we go now brother claim she the doctor I'm not a quack I'm a doctor you're a doctor you apply the right medicine you're a doctor maybe not a doctor of medicine but for a doctor here we go the first time when your eyes become open when you eat the right medicine when you are born again when you have a new understanding when the holy spirit opens your understanding that you go and you say I did not know that you made my family I have to start with my family oh I I you I answer but before you go with your family that's the hard part now what I'm doing right now this is a Deliverance service some many service I am giving you special delivery not as a smart alec but as your brother I am delivering to you putting in your hands the opportunity medicine to take it I don't care what is hurting you okay there we go I don't care if you have a drug addict at home that gives you no peace you know what I'm talking about nobody nobody knows what I'm talking about okay but that's okay I don't care what kind of problems you got I don't care if you if you have a problem with a bottle that you want to uncork it every night so you can or to relieve the pressures I don't care what kind of drug you use but until you get the right drug and the right remedy which is Jesus Christ the application of the right things to do to be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ to receive the Holy Spirit you you'll never get delivered I said it kind of um uh um okay tell me I got 7 minutes left that's good that means I've I've talked a lot okay okay okay I'm going to give you a uh we're going to read a scripture here and um one more scripture and we start to close so you can see

Jesus walking by the Sea of Galilee saw two brethren Simon called Peter and Andrew's Brother cast an a net into the sea for they were Fishers and he said unto them follow me and I will make you Fishers of Men okay where's that going with you going with that you as a doctor you have to cast you have to cast now the the word cast is it's a verb it's action how many you understood that you have to throw something throw through the air through the or hurl or fling something to cast to to cause to fall upon on the statue for example cast a long shadow on the ground there it is brother right
