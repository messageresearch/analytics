the privilege to tell you one of the greatest stories ever told and it's about our saviors birth it all started over 2,000 years ago when an angel came and told Mary she had found she had found grace in front of the Lord and that she would bear a son and his name would be Jesus now she believed and she had the had faith and as time passed and she was due to have the baby a decree went through all the land telling everyone to go back home to their native land so Joseph gathered his things and Mary got her things ready and they went down to Bethlehem and here they come Joseph and Mary arrived into Bethlehem saw how crowded it was full of people they were tired they have journeyed for so long and they wanted a place to rest so Joseph looked for the innkeeper and said innkeeper innkeeper we've traveled for so long do you have any room for us the innkeeper said no we don't so Joseph kept searching and he found another innkeeper innkeeper innkeeper do you have any room we've traveled for so long my wife is about to have a baby just one room and he said no then he kept searching and searching for another innkeeper and he said innkeeper innkeeper we've looked we searched we need just one small room you have any room for me and my wife she's due to have a baby and the innkeeper said sorry there's no room but I do have a barn you are more welcome to it and Joseph and Mary said okay and so they came and they entered the barn and here in this barn not big not grand but here our Lord Jesus was born they wrapped him in cloth they laid him in a manger and underneath the stars so bright the angels sang and told the Shepherd's that in the town of Bethlehem the Christ the Lord had been born come and see him so today we have our drummer boys and drummer girls here to honor our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Applause]
