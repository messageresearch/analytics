pressure already let off thank you all for being here this evening we prepared a nice little drama for you and it's a compilation of short stories of spoken by our Prophet brother Bram and there's going to you're going to find that there's music in the in the recordings as well so if you've heard the message by Brother Bram preached in Los Angeles titled letting off the pressure there's special songs in that tape and there's music and there's a harmonica solo and and trumpet music and it's one of the few messages that I've heard that that they were they kept the music in it so we incorporated that for you in the drama as well how many know that that the Lord Jesus specializes that the Lord Jesus specializes in releasing pressure see this world is built up with pressure school work bills bullies n bullies look how do you say bully cuz there's grownup bullies too yeah bullies Brut bad people what did you say abusers AB all that that could comp piling down on you sickness anxiety disease frustration depression all of the anger bitterness it's all a horrible fight that we have to fight but the Lord Jesus who is rich in Mercy who saved us and brought us to life when we were dead in sin and trespasses woo he can come and release that pressure he can come and release that pressure hallelujah hallelujah oh we're about if somebody doesn't let off some pressure I'm going to explode he has it he has the answer for us all we have to do is accept him Trust In His holy name amen and without any further Ado our our young children have worked very hard to put this little skit together for you we present to you letting off the pressure would you please give the Lord a clap of praise [Applause] all [Music] [Music] all all things [Music] are Jesus is here Jesus is here all things are possible Jesus is here Jesus is the Lord spared his life is cus I heard about but I'm so glad that the thing that we preach about it also works among see that God heals the sick and The Afflicted and uh we just got a few moments and about two minutes to speak and then I'd like to pray for those in radio land and those who are needy we just left the Southern Pines North Carolina where the Lord did A great miracle one night when we coming in it was too late for the little lady who had arried with a Waterhead baby to get a prayer card and get in the line but she was standing behind the curtains with this precious little child and tears streaming down her cheeks like only a mother's love could go for a baby and his little head was swollen in such a condition its little eyes pushed out very big veins over its head and some kind of a shots that the physician had to give it each day in order to live through that day and as I passed by I looked over and seen the mother with the little baby and I said to Billy my son that poor little fell and he said and daddy she asked me for a prayer card and said she uh she was too late I didn't give them all out I said well just tell them to sing the song again and only believe and let me run down and pray for the [Music] baby be oh all things are possible only only be only be all things are possible only [Music] and I went down and prayed for the little fell and asked our Lord to be merciful to him and the lady taking the little fellow home that night and the next morning when she rose up to her surprise to look at the little fell the big veins was gone the head was practically normal [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] so she rushed it over to the doctor right away and the doctor was so amazed and he said it he checked its blood or whatever they had to do for this shot well I said it doesn't need it anymore and it made quite a stir around through the country just another testimony to the glory of God and know that he he answers prayer when the hearts are sincere and want to believe on him there's nothing too great for him to do and I believe that he just loves to do that for his [Music] [Applause] people believe things are possible amen [Music] [Applause] God glory [Applause] trting one time I was up in the northwest of fishing and I had a trout line of many you fisherman Brethren here and I was packed out on my back with a little pup ENT and i' W back up into the mountains and I had a little pup tent and some you know equipment and I was catching trout and I just catch enough for what I eat and turn the rest of them loose and I just love to fish for those little [Music] Brook and um I had a moose Willa behind me that was catching my line all the time the morning I thought well i' go down and get me um my Hatchet and cut those moose willas off so my little Coachman wouldn't catch in the in the [Applause] Willow and I left the tent went out and chopped it down and had my little axe and caught my fish and come back and an old mother bear in her Cubs that got my tent [Music] [Applause] [Music] and they just tore it all the pieces and so a bear it's just like uh you know you heard of a bear in a China closet it's not what they destroy not what they eat it's what they destroy had a little stove pipe and she just smashed out all the pieces just to hear it Rattle and so uh I noticed and I I do love I anybody here from Kentucky I love Flapjacks you know that you call them pancakes shly and so um and I I like to put m on them and um and I um I I'm not I don't sprinkle I baptize so I really pour it on your plenty plenty molasses and and strange thing when I come up the old mother bear run away over to one side and she CED to the Cubs and one little Cub run off with her the other Little Cub just sat there had his back turned little bitty fellas in springtime and I know better than to approach too close to that little fell because mother might scratch me so um uh she kept coing to it I noticed what's the matter with the little fell and I looked around and he had his head all down like this you know he's moving his hand up and down I thought what's he got I walked around keeping a tree always in [Music] mine so to get up the tree before she could get to me and I walked around and this little fell had got my molassy bucket [Music] and he got the his uh the lid off of it and he didn't know of course how to drink it and he just stick his little paw down like this and lick it up over his face like and they love sweet stuff and he was molasses from the top of his head to the bottom of his feet and he would lick it and I holler get away from there [Music] he didn't pay a bit attention to him and his mother call him he still didn't pay any attention to him I thought well he's found something awful [Laughter] [Music] good so when he looked around he couldn't open his eyes just sticking pull masses know funniest looking little fell I thought yeah there's no condemnation to them it's in the patch that's one than sure I thought just like a real old Pentecostal meeting right this morning got her hands down a molassy Jes as far as it can licking you know the thing of it was when he finally dropped the bucket and run off to them that was scared to come up there and get it the rest of them licking [Music] licking the my lasses off so that's L what we've been doing this morning look at my lashes from these testimonies [Music] [Music] [Music] [Applause] love y amen [Music] back [Music] [Music] [Applause] okay over in the book of Isaiah I just like to quote from one just for a just a few moments uh Isaiah 32:2 and um the name of the Lord is a mighty tower he's a rock in a weary land a shelter in the time of storm I would like to think of that The Rock in a weary land not seeing this group kind of brings something to my memory that is I'd like to State this or text this to say this letting off the pressure I think that's what's happened this morning you know the world is built up under pressure everything is going at a break neck speed and they don't know where they're going they go down the road at 90 M an hour to stop in a Tavern and drink 2 hours before they get home and it just seems to be such a pressure everybody irritable pushing shoving and I I just wonder what the Cure is then I remember a few days ago our pastor I'd come in and I was late with my calls and people gathering in you know internationally around there and sit in the hotels and motel and things waiting and then the pastor was worn out he couldn't make some of his calls and some of them were emergency so I tooked some of his and went to one the the city hospital and the a room 331 I believe was the number I was to go to a woman facing uh an operation and I went down to 3:31 and the woman wasn't there so I went back up and a nurse was standing there patting her foot and I said how do you do I said could you tell me where Miss such a name is I said she's supposed to be in 331 she said well if she's supposed to be in 331 she is I thought oh my thank you I went back to 331 again and they said well maybe it's 3:32 across the hall no said she isn't here it might have been 2:31 so I went down the stairs and there was a little doctor sitting there at the desk Little Man the first one I ever seen was as broad as he was H so he was sitting there at the switchboard and I passed by and I said how do you do he just looked at me kind of strange I thought uh I don't want to ask him so went on down the room and there was a lady coming from the operation room a lady with a mask over her face and and U the nurse there at the floor she went over to the desk and I said lady I'm a bit confused I said I went upstairs to see a lady at 3:31 and she wasn't there and I couldn't find they said maybe she's at at 2:31 she said well then looking 231 I said well thank you my I couldn't find 231 so I went start down the hall and the little doctor was walking along with the steros Scopes in his hand twist them around like this I said good evening sir I said I'm looking for 231 could you tell me said this way and that way I said thank you for your information what is it I went back and there was another lady sitting over to the desk and I thought she looked pretty calm so I said lady could you tell me told her my story I said I'm a bit confused I'm a minister I'm here to make a call she said just a moment sir she went over looked on the book said yes go right around the corner she's and she's in two part1 so I thought well praise God somebody had the pressure off see it's just the buil up pressure it's the age that we're living in an neurotic age where people don't know what to do where they're going and the doctors don't have the answer for it that's right because the psychiatrist is being doctored by the psychiatrist so they have not the answer but there's some answer surely somewhere we could deal on it for hours but I was just thinking that God has the answer if they could just set in a place like this takes off the pressure amen with people who are are entered into eternity we are not going into it we're already in it right TR God lay out the pr [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Applause] Glory if the colored people are here excuse this expression but the color lady who gave the testimony at the convention one time she said got up and gave her testimony she said Wells I want to say this she said I ain't what I ought to be and I ain't what I want to be and then again I know I ain't what I used to be so that was it so we know that we have passed from Death un life because we are alive we're not what we used to be oh it's wonderful to know that the pressure can be let off that's all the name of the Lord is a mighty tower that the righteous run into and he is a rock in a weary land that's right a rock in a weary land the Lord of my life he has never fail on my own glory to God I could never succeed this one I came to know there is so much I owe and I cannot fail the Lord I was reading some time ago of a great Eagles I preached once in the convention of Eagle because the only way I know how to speak is watch nature and God lives in nature watching the eagle seeing its traits and up at the temple up here preaching on the lamb and the dove the nature of them and see all them things are just God speaking to us and there's one type of Eagle there's 40 different kinds of them means a ripper with the beak and this Eagle as he gets old there's a crust comes over his head and um he gets old he goes blind almost and he can't hardly get around finally when he gets weary and all of these feathers are getting loose so he cannot fly very high anymore then he goes till he goes High into the mountains till he finds a certain Rock there he sets at that rock now the job is that he's got to beat his head against that rock until all that crust flies off I cannot fail the Lord I cannot fail oh Lord he has never failed me yet every problem he has met and I cannot fail the Lord and they say he'll beat and beat until his head will bleed he'll almost knock himself out he'll come back and beat again until all the crust is gone when all that crust goes off his head though he's bleeding and wounded he's got the Assurance he'll raise up and flop what feathers he's got and scream out he lets off the pressure why he knows as soon as all that crust is gone he's going to renew his life again he gets renewed again new life is sure to come when all the crust is gone then sings my soul Oh My Savior God to thee How Great Thou Art how great th then sings my soul my savior God to thee How Great Thou Art how great th and why think what how great a God is to be mindful of his Eagle to give that eagle a way to renew his life when he's old only thing he has to do is beat the crust off that's a great thing but oh I know another rock and I shall that a man can beat the crust of the world off there until every unbelief has dropped and every shatter and ever fet has gone until he has got all the world beat out of him all the unbelief beat out of him all the pride beat out of him all the starch beat out of him then new life is sure to come then you can let off the Steam and just start rejoicing because new life is sure to come as long as you can beat the UN belie out of you take things and not take some uh Dogma some Creed or something as some man has made of just take the unadulterated word of God and believe it and stay there until it becomes a reality to you I'm telling you New Birth is on its Road that's exactly we can let off the steam man because New Birth is on its [Music] Road H [Music] howah [Applause] [Music] [Applause] only be oh [Applause] be all things are passable all all oh only all things are possible [Music] only I was preaching up in the mountains one time in Kentucky and I made a an altar call there's a great big old fell come back there was going to throw me out of the meeting it was in car cut in time and he uh he just had his trouser leg ripped open and had a nail in it and his Co gow up there and throw this little Holy Roller preacher out so uh they told me he was coming and when he come to the door four or five great big bullies and arms closed like this I just kept on preaching away and he waited a little too long he couldn't get the altar quick enough he fell in the middle of the floor and began to throw his hands up crying God be merciful to me a sinner calling out at the altar and then when the Holy Spirit come down and revealed and told him what he would done standing there that's what got him when he stood there and told him that another woman he was running with and there said his wife and two children sitting there shaming for the very act that he had done he know that took more than man to do that it took God to do something like that and he screamed coming to the alt crying be merciful to me God I'm a [Music] [Applause] [Music] sinner the next day come back he said brother Brandon I had a dream last night that I was a rabbit sitting out in the field and he said a great hound got after [Music] me he said I started running for all that was in me I didn't know where to go and said I looked up on the mountain and there was a big rock and it had a hole in it he said I thought if I could ever get to that rock I could let off the pressure Glory he said the Hound was so close I could feel his breath on my heels he said but when I got in I sat down and let off the pressure that's a good thing to do there is a rock that where we can find he's a rock in a weary land where we can sit down and let off the pressure [Applause] [Music] [Applause] amen can we just give the children another round of
