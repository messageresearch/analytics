[29:58] you know we're here
[29:59] tonight because it's the Deliverance
[30:03] service we came with a
[30:05] need I know I did I came with a need to
[30:10] get closer to Jesus
[30:14] Christ you know to to give them all my
[30:17] everything I have within
[30:19] me and I believe that if we all come in
[30:21] that same mind
[30:24] tonight we got something going because
[30:27] that day on
[30:29] Pentecost when they went into the upper
[30:34] room I'm
[30:36] sorry they were all in one
[30:39] mind in one Accord they all needed
[30:43] something you know they all carried
[30:45] there and made themselves right with
[30:49] God I believe that we all come in one
[30:52] mind right
[30:53] now there's nothing that God cannot
[30:56] do know if we all
[30:58] came to be delivered of something we're
[31:02] in one mind tonight how manys can I do I
[31:05] have who wants to be delivered tonight
[31:08] who wants to give everything they're
[31:09] struggling with to the Lord Jesus Christ
[31:12] know I know that through all my life I
[31:15] tried everything every single way no to
[31:19] to to to
[31:21] overcome and I couldn't do it but there
[31:24] was one day that I gave my life to Jesus
[31:26] Christ
[31:28] and that day I was able to overcome and
[31:31] it was not because of my works it
[31:34] because of what he did on
[31:36] Calvary for you and if we understand
[31:39] that
[31:41] tonight we'll get to the next step of
[31:45] our we're going to turn to the
[31:48] Bible to Isaiah
[31:50] 61 you know it's it's it's a it's a
[31:53] famous
[31:54] scripture you know but I but I love it
[31:57] you know I love the
[31:59] scripture because that's what brings
[32:00] life to us you know is the scripture
[32:04] know then mix with the Holy
[32:06] Ghost we got something going brothers
[32:08] and
[32:09] sisters you know Isaiah 61 says
[32:12] this the spirit of the Lord is upon
[32:17] me because the Lord has anointed me to
[32:20] preach Good
[32:24] Tidings unto the meek
[32:28] he has sent me to bind up the
[32:34] Brokenhearted to Proclaim Liberty to the
[32:39] captives and to open the prison door to
[32:42] them that are
[32:46] bound you know it's it's when I was
[32:50] reading the
[32:52] scripture the word

[33:19] I've been
[33:22] captive and have not been able to do
[33:24] nothing for
[33:25] myself you know it's a terrible
[33:28] situation
[33:29] brother when a person is captive you
[33:32] cannot do nothing for yourself it
[33:34] doesn't matter if you jump or Shout
[33:37] Scream throw

[37:58] tonight let me go
[38:01] back it says he said God has anointed me
[38:05] to preach the
[38:06] gospel bring
[38:09] Tidings to to set the captives
[38:13] free and to open the prison
[38:16] doors and let the captives Go
[38:19] free so he's talking about Jesus
[38:22] Christ know Isaiah prophesies this that
[38:26] there was going to come a
[38:28] savior that was going to do these things
[38:31] and we're living in the age that the
[38:34] Savior already came and he left but he
[38:37] sent us something
[38:39] wonderful that was his Holy Ghost and
[38:42] that Holy Ghost was going to come into
[38:45] our lives and help us overcome our
[38:48] problems our needs everything we have to
[38:51] go
[38:53] to and he and he says this
[39:00] it says God he God it says God sent
[39:02] Christ to open the prison
[39:05] doors of man who are sitting in
[39:10] darkness let me tell you brothers and
[39:13] sisters if you're sitting in
[39:16] darkness if you feel like you have no
[39:19] hope maybe depressions on you maybe
[39:23] you're so overcome by your problems in
[39:25] your life
[39:28] God sent Jesus
[39:30] Christ for that purpose to help you in
[39:35] that part and stage in your life that
[39:37] you are right
[39:40] now and it says and
[39:43] notice the type that he spoke
[39:47] to setting them free it wasn't the
[39:53] illiterate it was the
[39:55] scholars
[39:58] the educated
[39:59] ones Christ come to set to set them
[40:03] free now to make it so that the little
[40:06] kitties would
[40:08] understand and when I was reading this
[40:10] brother Ernie came to my
[40:14] mind because he always says you got to
[40:17] have that childlike
[40:20] Faith you got to believe and trust in
[40:23] God with that childlike
[40:25] faith
[40:27] you know when your when my daughter
[40:29] comes to me and she ask me for something
[40:32] she knows that I'm going to give it to
[40:34] her she trusts in me she would have no
[40:37] doubt she knows that her Daddy has what
[40:41] she needs and if he and if he has it he
[40:44] will give it to her and that's the way
[40:46] it is with Jesus Christ we come to him
[40:50] with that faith of a little
[40:53] child knowing that he had has what you
[40:57] need he's going to give it to you if you
[41:00] are captive tonight you are in prison
[41:03] and you can't overcome come to Jesus
[41:06] Christ with that childlike faith and he
[41:09] will give you the power to overcome what
[41:14] do you mean power yeah he'll give you
[41:16] the power over them Spirits
[41:20] over over your problem over anything
[41:24] that you're going through that Holy
[41:28] Spirit able to in your
[41:32] life he says for he says for instance
[41:36] today that each one that each one of you
[41:40] were sentenced to
[41:43] death you were s you were s you were
[41:46] sitting in a
[41:48] prison knowing that sunrise tomorrow

[42:08] God that don't want to go all the way
[42:11] that are are that are

[42:21] [Music]
[42:24] failure Maybe

[42:33] wrong that you don't trust nobody let me
[42:36] tell you brothers and sisters I found
[42:38] myself in that situation I found myself
[42:41] in prison not being able to help myself
[42:45] having people tell me what to
[42:47] do having people tell me when to wake up
[42:50] and when to go to
[42:51] sleep not a good thing let me tell you
[42:55] the author of that
[42:57] life was Satan because he had me where
[43:01] he wanted me and maybe tonight brothers
[43:03] and sister you're in that way
[43:06] spiritually you can't worship God the
[43:08] way you want to you can't walk with God
[43:11] the way you want you can't surrender to
[43:13] God the way he want the author of that
[43:16] life Satan no because that's his
[43:20] Masterpiece to make you fail to make you
[43:23] not

[49:35] one but I doubt it but I was battling I
[49:39] wasn't battling with my wife I wasn't
[49:42] battling with my daughter I was battling
[49:44] with my flesh because the
[49:48] Tormentor came to me and he started
[49:50] telling me you know what you you're
[49:52] you're not feeling
[49:53] good gives you this pain
[49:56] he gives you this pain and that pain but
[49:59] you know what you got to give it right

[50:04] already came and healed me I don't care
[50:07] what you say I'm made whole in Jesus
[50:11] Christ and he says
[50:13] yes Jesus plainly explained
[50:17] it when he said to the
[50:19] woman that had that stooped that had
[50:22] been stooped
[50:24] over
[50:28] and we're going to go to that scripture
[50:29] real quick you know and this this is
[50:31] tremendous brothers and
[50:34] sisters Luke
[50:37] 1311 and it
[50:39] says and behold there was a woman which
[50:43] had a spirit of infirmity 18
[50:46] years go ahead and was bowed to and was
[50:49] bowed together and could not no wise
[50:51] lift up
[50:54] herself
[51:06] so I could just imagine this this this
[51:08] woman
[51:09] okay she had she she had a
[51:12] sickness that was she she was like this
[51:16] she could not do nothing about
[51:18] it she was
[51:20] helpless she couldn't do nothing about
[51:23] it I bet you you know she was in a
[51:25] horrible
[51:27] situation not being able to do nothing
[51:29] for
[51:31] herself you know she she she probably
[51:34] was made fun
[51:37] of you know you know jokes about
[51:40] her she might have been an
[51:43] outcast you know she might have dealt
[51:45] with
[51:45] [Applause]
[51:47] anxiety so many things for 18
[51:51] years she was not made
[51:54] whole but one day she came into contact
[51:58] with the Lord Jesus Christ let me tell
[52:01] you brothers and sister if you're if

[52:13] tonight there is somebody that can open
[52:17] the prison doors for you there is
[52:19] somebody that already healed you there
[52:22] is somebody that will come to your
[52:24] rescue
[52:27] and that's the Lord Jesus
[52:28] Christ because it says in the
[52:31] scripture and when Jesus saw
[52:34] her he called to her he he called her to
[52:41] him and said unto
[52:43] her woman thou are loose from thy
[52:48] infirmity and he laid his hands on
[52:52] her immediately not to oh not next week
