[31:37] you have at home
[31:40] and just begin to think about the love
[31:42] that I have for you.

[35:29] There's nothing you can. He tells me
[35:32] that my family are lost and and so many
[35:37] terrible things. He tells me that's it.
[35:42] It's over.
[35:44] But I I when I feel bad, I just remember
[35:50] the word of the Lord that tells me in
[35:54] the Bible,
[35:57] it says not to worry for anything.
[36:02] [Music]
[36:04] Not to worry for what? Not to worry
[36:07] about anything, but pray and ask God for
[36:12] everything that I need. Ooh, can you say
[36:15] amen to that? Amen. And when I pray, I
[36:20] have to give thanks and then God's peace

[40:04] Lord, Aolita? It sure does. I feel so
[40:08] much better now. See, it's like like in
[40:10] the Bible when King David when he was in
[40:13] the field, he would play his harp and
[40:16] the spirit of the Lord would come down
[40:18] and he would feel better. How many How
[40:22] many have experienced that God heals you
[40:25] through music? Yes. Isn't it beautiful?
[40:29] Yes. Oh, thanks Aalita for that. I
[40:31] believe that we all got a blessing.

[46:12] wonder how do you feel over here, Miha?
[46:15] Are you still sick?
[46:17] Oh, yes, she is.
[46:21] Yes. Um, I've been sick for a while and
[46:23] I was just wondering if Abalita can just
[46:26] pray for me so I could be healed. Oh,
[46:28] you cannot be healed? I think that's a
[46:31] great idea cuz Aalita has a lot of
[46:33] faith. Of course, I've trusted in the
[46:36] Lord for so many years. But the days of
[46:39] miracles have passed. Oh, devil, you're
[46:42] such love. Can we say boo?
[46:46] Devil, you're a bluffer. There's no more
[46:49] healing. Leard devil. Be gone. Be gone.
[46:54] Man, that guy. You get rid of him once
[46:57] and he keeps coming back. He's like a
[46:59] pimple.
[47:01] He needs to be popped. That's right. I
[47:04] sure would be honored to pray for you,
[47:08] Mita. Thank you, Aalita. Let's pray.
[47:11] Everybody bow your heads. Bow your
[47:14] heads. Yes, please pray with us. Close
[47:16] your eyes. Okay. What's your trouble,
[47:18] Miha? Well, my throat really hurts and
[47:22] it it won't go away. It just really
[47:24] hurts. Okay, Miha, that's no problem for
[47:27] God.
[47:29] Lord Jesus, your precious little
[47:32] daughter is here, Lord. Oh,
[47:38] and she's so sick and her throat hurts.
[47:47] Please come and touch her throat. Thank
[47:50] you, Jesus.
[47:52] Please help her feel better, Lord. I
[47:55] pray in your precious name of the Lord
[47:58] Jesus Christ. Amen. Amen. Amen. I
[48:02] believe I'm healed and I feel like

[48:29] and thank the Lord. Even if you don't
[48:31] feel better, you have to thank him in
[48:35] faith.
[48:37] Okay, don't forget to sit up straight,
[48:39] Miha, and cross your legs like a lady.
[48:47] Jesus can heal you, but you have to be a
[48:49] Christian to stay healed. Okay, that's
[48:51] right.

[49:05] to the holy.

[55:20] job. How How does your throat feel? It
[55:23] feels much better. Praise God. Thank

[55:28] to heal. Yes, he does. So, Brother
[55:31] Bernie Jr., accept it. You don't have to
[55:33] cough anymore. Brother Jesus has power
[55:36] to heal. Yes. He came back from Peru
[55:39] with a sore throat. Do we believe that
[55:41] Jesus can heal him, too? Amen. We
[55:44] believe it. And we're going to pray with
[55:46] you, okay, brother Bernie? You can
[55:48] receive it. Hey. Amen. We love you and
[55:51] thank you for all you do in the
[55:52] missionary field. Yes. Me home. Thank
[55:54] you. Next time you go, please tell the
[55:56] brothers hello for us. Amen. Yes.
[56:01] God bless you.
[56:04] You know, is there anybody out in the
[56:06] audience that has a testimony about
[56:08] healing? Anybody? Oh, do you? Wow,
[56:12] you're such a pretty lady. Why don't you
[56:13] come up here and give that testimony?
[56:16] That would be wonderful.
[56:19] Let's see if we can get a microphone for
[56:21] you.
[56:24] You look like a beautiful kangaroo with
[56:27] that little guy on your stomach.
[56:30] Can you come up here? Cuz the microphone
[56:32] won't reach you. Let me help you. There
[56:34] you go. What's your name? My name's
[56:37] Lizzie. Can you share with us what the
[56:39] Lord put on your heart? Yes, I can.
[56:43] So, I have a testimony about how God
[56:46] healed my little baby right here,
[56:48] Gideon, this week. Um, so last week on
[56:53] Sunday, Gideon started getting sick.
[56:57] Um, and he wasn't happy. He was really
[57:00] fussy.
[57:02] But I didn't take him to the doctor on
[57:04] Sunday. We just kind of dealt with it.
[57:05] And on Monday, he was just getting worse
[57:08] and worse and worse. And I took him to
[57:10] the doctor. She thought he had an ear
[57:12] infection. So she gave me medicine and
[57:14] sent me home. And at home, I gave him
[57:18] the medicine. and instead of getting
[57:20] better, he got even sicker.
[57:24] Um, you know, for for you parents who
[57:26] who who know the numbers, he had a fever
[57:28] of 105.6
[57:30] after antibiotics and Tylenol. Um, so I
[57:34] ended up having to take him to the
[57:35] hospital
[57:37] and we were in the hospital most of the
[57:39] week. Um, and the doctors did not know
[57:43] what was wrong with Gideon. They did all
[57:46] sorts of tests to try and find out what
[57:48] was making him sick. And they couldn't
[57:50] find anything making him sick. They just
[57:53] knew he was sick. And it was a hard time
[57:57] for Bernie the third, Gideon's dad, and
[57:59] I because we were battling in our minds
[58:02] when the devil would try and come and
[58:03] tell us things. And I remember saying in
[58:06] my mind, "Devil, why are you bringing
[58:09] this trial now? you know, I'm just gonna
[58:12] go up in church and tell the testimony
[58:14] of how God healed my baby. Amen.
[58:19] But the devil was up to his old tricks.
[58:21] He tried to bluff and he would say,
[58:24] "You're not going to give a testimony.
[58:26] You're going to bury your baby."
[58:29] And
[58:30] that was hard thing to hear. But we had
[58:34] to stand strong and believe that God was
[58:37] able to heal Gideon. Amen. That's right.
[58:41] One of the things that helped us was
[58:43] Bernie's uncle Tim sent us a message
[58:46] preached by brother Brandham. And when
[58:49] we listened to that message, it was a
[58:51] story about another little girl who was
[58:54] sick. The doctors couldn't figure out
[58:57] what was making her sick, but just that
[58:59] it was causing her a lot of problems.
[59:01] And Brother Brandon prayed for her in
[59:03] that sermon, and by faith, I believe she
[59:06] got better. When I heard that sermon, I
[59:08] thought, "Wow, God, if you can do it for
[59:11] her in 1960, Amen. you can do it for us
[59:15] in 2014."
[59:17] That's right. So, we prayed for our baby
[59:21] and held on in faith. And when the
[59:23] doctors would come with more bad news,
[59:26] we had to ignore everything that they
[59:30] were trying to tell us because we knew
[59:31] that God's word was the truth. Amen. And
[59:36] on Friday afternoon, after almost a week
[59:39] in the hospital, Gideon was finally
[59:42] released. The doctors still didn't know
[59:45] exactly what had made him sick. They had
[59:47] a best guess. Um, but they could see
[59:50] that he was 100% better. So, they
[59:54] couldn't keep him there anymore cuz he
[59:56] wasn't sick. So, that's our testimony
[59:58] that God,
[1:00:00] he's our great physician. Amen. Amen.
[1:00:04] When the doctors did the best that they
[1:00:06] could and they couldn't fix what was
[1:00:09] wrong, God came down on the scene and
[1:00:13] knew exactly what was wrong with Gideon.
[1:00:15] And exactly how to fix it. And he did.
[1:00:18] The doctors had to poke him and all
[1:00:20] kinds of stuff. Huh. Yes, they did. How
[1:00:22] many times did they poke him? Oh my. A
[1:00:25] lot of times. Turn so they can see the
[1:00:27] vein.
[1:00:29] Bernie was telling me they poked him
[1:00:31] like nine times trying to find a vein.
[1:00:34] because he was so dehydrated, he needed
[1:00:36] fluids and the veins that they would
[1:00:38] make contact with would burst because
[1:00:41] they weren't strong enough. So, finally
[1:00:44] they had to get an IV in his head and he
[1:00:47] was poked everywhere and he had wires
[1:00:48] everywhere. He looked like a VCR. He was
[1:00:51] just it was a mess. He was crying and it
[1:00:55] was a heartbreak situation. But finally,
[1:00:57] when the Lord came down and healed him
[1:01:00] and took away his fever, remember he was
[1:01:03] smiling and giggling and and back to his
[1:01:06] old baby habits like like drooling and
[1:01:09] and farting and doing all the stuff that
[1:01:11] babies should be doing. Babies should be
[1:01:14] doing that, right, Dr. Bunny? It's
[1:01:16] normal. And thank God cuz he wasn't
[1:01:18] doing it at first, but then we could
[1:01:21] smell that he was better. Amen.
[1:01:25] Can we give the Lord a round of
[1:01:27] applause? Praise the Lord.
[1:01:30] Amalita, can you give us a tono on the
[1:01:33] piano? Oh, see go ahead and we'll grab
[1:01:35] your guitar. Let's all stand. We're
[1:01:37] going to sing What a Friend We Have in
[1:01:39] Jesus. Can we do that? Let's all sing

[1:05:47] thank you so much for coming to Phoenix
[1:05:49] Tabernacle and I hope you continue to
[1:05:51] come visit us. Oh yes. Yes. Gracias. But
[1:05:54] most of all, can we all say thank you to
[1:05:56] our most important guest this evening?
[1:06:01] Can we say thank you, Jesus? Thank you,
[1:06:04] Jesus. Say, we love you. We love you.
[1:06:08] Let's give them a round of applause.
[1:06:10] Thank you very much. You guys miss.
[1:06:16] Praise God. Let us just all bow our
[1:06:19] heads really, really quick.
[1:06:22] Lord, gracious and heavenly father,
[1:06:24] thank you so much for bringing us here,
[1:06:26] Lord, so we can learn about the power of
[1:06:28] prayer. Oh, we know we can submit our
[1:06:31] loved ones to you in prayer. Oh, we know
[1:06:34] that if we're fearful or afraid, we can
[1:06:37] go to you in prayer and you can make us
[1:06:39] brave. Lord, we also know that if we're
[1:06:42] sick, we could come to you, Lord. Oh,
[1:06:44] Lord, after we pray to you, we got to
[1:06:46] remember to thank you, say thank you and
[1:06:50] praise you. So prayer and praise are our
[1:06:54] two very strong weapons against the
[1:06:56] enemy. We thank you Lord for all this
[1:06:59] and we ask that you bless us in the
[1:07:01] precious name of the Lord Jesus Christ.
[1:07:04] And the children of the Lord said, amen.
[1:07:08] Amen. God bless you. Amen.
