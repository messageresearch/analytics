time we sing it I get these visions and it's so amazingly beautiful and we have other songs that we sing other hymns that give me that impression and I got to tell you it leaves an impression on me that's heavenly tonight it is it is my honor distinct honor that I'm not worthy of but to bring you the next half of the chapter chapter 35 of the book supernatural the life of William Branham we're in book three the man and his commission from 1946 to 1950 written by Owen Jorgensen and if you remember in the first half of this chapter last reading there was a very historic series of services a campaign in Phoenix Arizona to brother Ernie was sharing some information about me about that about that group of services to me and and very amazing just a very amazing thing happened there are many miracles happened here in Phoenix right here in Phoenix Arizona in 1947 February it was and brother Brandon played prayed for 2,500 people in a prayer line in one night that's an almost inconceivable number and a testament to his his willpower to serve the Lord Jesus Christ tonight we will read the second half of the chapter entitled refusing a check for 1 million five hundred thousand dollars now we did the math on it last time brother Ernie and using the average inflation of three and a half percent per year since 1947 and twenty eighteen dollars it's over seventeen million dollars so to share that with you but brother Brandon had to come to a decision point he was also presented a very similar moment back in 1937 and if brother Brandon was here today I know in my heart he he wouldn't make the same to sue but this time I'm so thankful that he made the decision he did and and the Lord was guiding him I mentioned last time you know there's the world economy and then there's God's economy brother Brennan and operated in God's economy and he proved that to the Lord when he made that that decision so we'll get started here he has now moved to California his next series of campaigns in March of 1947 bill worked his way up to California coast his first meeting Los Angeles overflowed a large Church in Monterey Park prompting the cooperating churches to move the meetings to the Municipal Auditorium in Long Beach California on the second night of the campaign three men and a young woman came through the prayer line carrying an unconscious woman on a stretcher bill grasped the patient's limp right hand and felt a familiar vibration it's cancer he said the young woman said yes her name is Malik Ian this is her doctor and I'm her daughter recently she went to st. Louis and had both her breasts removed trying to stop it spread but it didn't help now God is her only hope lowering his head bill asked God for a miracle the vibrations in his hand ceased he was about to pronounce her healed when a strange feeling came over him and he said without thinking thus saith the Lord in three days this woman will be shopping in the street markets her doctor who had evidently come along to oblige de family huffed indignantly the very idea Reverend Branham this woman is obviously dying how can you give her people false hopes like that calmly bill returned doctor if that woman isn't well and walking on the street in three days you can put a sign on my back that says I'm a false prophet and you can drive me around town on the hood of your car towards the end of the week bill roused from his exhausted sleep to the sound of heavy knocking on his hotel room door in the hallway stood a church official whose job was to guard Bill's privacy but high hymns too to well-dressed strangers I'm sorry to bother you brother branham but these two men need to see you I know you have to get some rest but their business is so extraordinary I thought come on in what can I do for you the two men stepped inside in the spokesman got right to his point we are agents of mr. Malik Ian Malik Ian bill repeated the name trying to remember where he had heard it before miss Morelli ken runs the Mission Bell winery his wife was healed of cancer in your meetings earlier this week now bill remember down conscious woman on the stretcher how is she doing mr. Branum her recovery has astonished everyone especially her doctor the day after you prayed for her she regained consciousness and sat up in bed on the third day she went shopping with her daughter just like you said she would mr. Milliken is so grateful to you that he sent us here to give you this check for $1,500,000 the man held out the check bill did not move the man said mr. Branum this is no joke it's a perfectly good check and it's made out to your name he extended the slip of paper bill still did not take the check he thought about his family living in a two-room shanty in Jeffersonville Indiana thought about his wife carrying water for half a city block to the house then carrying the dirty dishwater outside again because the house didn't have indoor plumbing he thought about how cold in traffic the house was in the winter and how maida stuffed rags around the doors and windows to keep out the wind it would be wonderful to give his family something better but for so many years bill had struggled to understand his calling in the Lord when he stepped out of the will of God in 1937 he suffered so terribly that now even $1,500,000 could tempt him to stray from his convictions he had not healed miss Maliki enough cancer the Lord Jesus Christ that healed her so how could he accept any recompense for something he had not done even beyond this building noted three Falls had often wrecked men who started out to live for God money popularity and women any Minister her flirted with these dangerous risks slipping and falling bill determined long ago to stay clear of all three regardless of what had cost him gentlemen he said firmly I don't even want to look at that check tell mr. Maliki and I appreciate the thought but I cannot accept his money after his last prayer line in Long Beach California which ended at 2:00 in the morning bill staggered numb and senseless to a waiting car Jack Moore and young brown drove him around town for an hour talking to him trying to get him to respond they rolled down his window to let the rain splatter in his face finally bill came back to himself enough to want to go to bed they drove him to his hotel when they stepped out of the elevator into a small waiting room a number of people crowded forward calling bills name wanting to talk to him more and brown were pushing him through the group when a woman fell on the floor in front of bill clutching the leg of his trousers Jack Moore reached down to pull her off but bill waved him away saying let's at least hear her story even with that assurance the woman would not let go of Bill's pant leg her eyes revealed her desperation brother branham I'm mrs. Kay my husband and I attended your meetings in Phoenix when you prayed for that epileptic child my husband refused to bow his head the next day he got a funny feeling all over his body he thought it was just his imagination playing tricks on him two days later two police found him wandering amyl too around downtown Phoenix his mind has snapped he doesn't know who he is or what he's doing now bill noticed a man standing back from the group his eyes were hollow his face gaunt his hair and closed his shovel his cheeks covered a scraggly beard is that your husband bill asked yes brother branham mrs. Kay wailed I've tried every night to get him into the prayer line but I never could do it now I'm desperate something has got to be done he won't eat I even have to pour water down him she dropped her forehead on bill shoe turning to Jack more bill said take mr. K into my room so we can have some privacy Jack more took mr. Kay's hand and led him as easily as if he were a mindless child bill tried to follow but mrs. K would not let go of his leg nor what could she be persuaded to loosen her grip finally more and brown picked bill up and carried him to his room dragging mrs. K along behind after locking the door they at last persuaded her to let go of Bill's leg sister bill said about a year ago an angel of the Lord met me and told me that I was to take a gift of healing to the peoples of the world he told me that if I would be sincere and could get the people to believe me then nothing would stand before my prayer I have found that to be true there is no affliction no matter how bad it is but what it would be healed if I took long enough praying for that person do you believe me yes brother Branham I do mrs. K stood very still not even blinking his eyes were fixed in the vacuous stare when bill approached him he shrank back and growled like an animal for safety's sake more an Brown held mr. Kay's arms while bill laid his hands on the man and prayed victory did not come easily for 45 minutes bill wrestled with that demon of insanity finally mr. kay blinked and looked around the room with the demeanor of a man who had just awakened in an unexpected place and was wondering where he was and why after his wife explained mr. kay threw his arms around Bill's neck and hugged him like a long-lost brother he left a hotel with his mind as sharp as ever although now quite sympathetic to the gospel of Jesus Christ god bless you [Applause] god bless you can we have the Sunday school kids come up ages 4 through 8 they're gonna sing they're special while they come up can we just sing jesus loves the little children we sing jesus loves the little children all the children of the world red and yellow black and white they are precious in His sight Jesus loves the little children of the world let's get up a little bit guys again Jesus loves the little cheese trained all the chicks [Music] can white they are precious [Music] praise God one more time Jesus Jesus [Music] can you make our children feel welcome with the party [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] amen as the next Sunday school class comes up can we just sing that Lord my heart is open [Music] nine to eleven your nine to eleven [Music] can you give the man they come [Music] every door [Music] [Music] more time to come on come on a voice [Music] [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] praise God hello can we have ages 12 to 14 come up as we sing Island Friends of God ages 12 to 14 amen can you sing it with us can you say I am a friend of God he calls me friend [Music] they call me Fred and I am a friend of God I am a friend of God boys come up 12 to 14 let's come up boys he calls me friend let's sing that again one more time I am a friend of God [Music] friend [Music] friend of God because [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] I was sure by now by me you'll have reach down right are tears away stepped in and saved a but once again I say Amen that is still raining and NASA thunder rolls I barely hear you whisper through the rain and as you mercy falls I raise my hands and praise a God who give and chase away [Music] you [Music] and every tear you hold in your hand you never my no I [Music] I will praise you in this door [Music] Oh [Music] Oh [Music] you've heard my cry raised me up my strength is always gone how can I get me on if I can't find you as if thunder rolls a baby hear you whispering and as mercy bar raise my hands and praise my god and takes away [Music] not pretty when is [Music] that you are and every year [Music] you are you never left my son my I'll praise you in this storm [Music] [Music] Oh [Applause] [Music] Oh [Music] [Music] Oh [Music] crazy witness my [Music] never holy [Music] [Applause] [Music] I will praise you in this Lord Oh [Music] Oh [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] amen praise God how many love will your children's worship the Lord how many love when your children worship the Lord children boys and girls there's no better thing that you can do we were created to worship the Lord so Kate can somebody just worship the Lord right where you are can you give a shout out can you clap your hands can you say thank you Jesus can you make a joyful noise [Applause] a man will you please stand a man performance at APA why don't we turn around and greet each other with a big smile say welcome to children's church the formal side without mercy no no Mozilla's bienvenidos al iglesia as we know starting like a sensation so nice to be in the house of the Lord amen amen there's one who said Nino in enid and Senora made to be a child son or daughter of God Eko she has immense sons and daughters amen como si si el hermano Bernie like brother Bernie would say as win over a nuestros hijos Olivar al señor de great to see our children where their Ament annoy your gue you must grant de como padre surely as a father there's no joy no nothing you could be more proud of in a nine euros mill this your Cho in the year 2018 Laveranues truce equals to see our children CC sabemos look at equal profit we understand what the Prophet said Vera nuestros hijos a la vandals in unison our prophet our see our children worship in the Lord today Elton Sassoon applause Oh a todos padres que todos new zinnias and a round of applause for all the parents and the children somos Milagros whether we are miracles amen man hey man Gloria do story -
