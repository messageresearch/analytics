[17:44] god bless you
[17:47] once again it's an honor here and a
[17:51] privilege to be able to bring to you
[17:52] that the next in this series of
[17:54] sequential excerpts in this series of
[17:56] books supernatural the life of William
[17:58] Branham we're in book three the man in
[18:00] his commissioned 1946 to 1950 written by
[18:04] Owen Jorgensen we're so thankful for
[18:07] this work this next chapter is entitled
[18:10] homecoming shock if you remember when we
[18:14] finished the last reading brother
[18:15] Brandon had finished a series our
[18:18] campaign in Jonesboro Arkansas which
[18:20] left them physically and even mentally
[18:23] exhausted he returned to Jeffersonville
[18:26] and as we will see in the chapter some
[18:30] things had changed as as far as the
[18:33] atmosphere of the neighborhood fact that
[18:35] was not lost on sister Mina however
[18:38] later in the chapter and we thank the
[18:40] Lord for for imparting the revelation to
[18:47] our prophet we marry Brandon when he
[18:50] needed it the most and you'll see that
[18:53] that particular situation on foam so
[18:56] we're in chapter 34 the year is still
[18:59] 1946 this will be the last chapter for
[19:02] this year of 1946
[19:10] in Jonesborough during the fall of 1946
[19:13] william branham stayed on the platform
[19:16] for eight straight days and nights
[19:18] praying for a steady stream of sick and
[19:20] needy he ate his meals on the platform
[19:23] and nap behind the pulpit while those in
[19:25] the prayer line stood patiently waiting
[19:27] for him to wake up and resume his work
[19:29] by the end of the week bills for head
[19:31] throbbed with weariness the backs of his
[19:33] hands were raw where he had pulled out
[19:35] the hairs trying to keep himself awake
[19:38] still he did not want to stop he wanted
[19:41] to stay there until he had prayed for
[19:42] every sick person who came through the
[19:44] doors
[19:45] but he couldn't the news of the healings
[19:48] and miracles was like a magnet drawing
[19:50] thousands more to Jonesboro throughout
[19:52] the week when bill finally did quit on
[19:55] the eighth night of that Jonesboro
[19:56] healing campaign the prayer line was
[19:58] longer than it was when he started bill
[20:01] felt exhausted physically and mentally
[20:04] pastor Reid put him to bed but bill felt
[20:06] so jittery he couldn't fall asleep he
[20:09] thrashed back and forth under the covers
[20:11] for hours at last rather than fighted he
[20:14] decided to drive home to just from Ville
[20:16] and collapse in his own bed where
[20:18] hopefully he could sleep for days
[20:19] undisturbed after a few hours of driving
[20:23] bill had trouble keeping his eyelids
[20:24] open to keep himself from falling asleep
[20:27] behind the steering wheel he beat his
[20:29] leg against the door until the paneling
[20:31] dented out of shape once he did doze off
[20:34] a blaring horn jerked him awake giving
[20:37] him just enough time to swerve back to
[20:39] his side of the road shaken he pulled
[20:42] the car over and stopped so he could get
[20:44] himself together made it was still
[20:46] asleep in the backseat bill got out
[20:49] hoping that a walk would refresh him
[20:51] somewhere he lost himself to exhaustion
[20:53] when he finally came back to his senses
[20:56] he found himself standing in the cow
[20:57] pasture with his hand stretched out
[21:00] mumbling only believe sister that's all
[21:03] you have to do just believe he shook his
[21:06] head fiercely thinking what is the
[21:08] matter with me I seem to be coming apart
[21:10] reaching Jeffersonville late in the
[21:12] evening they stopped at Maeda's parents
[21:14] house to pick up their children
[21:16] Rebecca was now five months old bill had
[21:19] not seen her for three months so it was
[21:20] not surprising that she didn't recognize
[21:23] him when he tried to hold her she cried
[21:25] and struggled to get back to her mother
[21:27] that hurt she doesn't know me he
[21:30] complained call me Rebecca with the
[21:32] swing of her body made a nodded at a
[21:34] picture of bill propped up on an end
[21:36] table I've got that same picture of you
[21:38] sitting on our dresser every day I
[21:40] pointed to it and told her that is your
[21:43] daddy bill looked at the picture then at
[21:46] his face in the hall mirror no wonder
[21:48] she doesn't recognize me I've lost 20
[21:50] pounds I've lost some hair and my
[21:52] shoulders stoop I don't look the same at
[21:54] all another shock awaited him or them
[21:58] when they drove up to their own house
[22:00] cars lined both sides of the street for
[22:02] several blocks and there were nearly 200
[22:04] people waiting for him in his yard
[22:06] what's this all about me to ask bill
[22:08] blushed everywhere I went I gave out our
[22:11] address and told people to stop by if
[22:12] they were ever near Jeffersonville and
[22:14] needed prayer I didn't think they would
[22:17] come this soon late into the night bill
[22:19] prayed for the crowd in his front yard
[22:21] finally the last person drove away May
[22:24] to help Bill get into bed it was 2:00
[22:26] a.m. he lay there quietly drifting into
[22:29] a limbo of half sleep suddenly he jerked
[22:32] awake his legs cramped made a setup bill
[22:36] do you know what you were doing I
[22:38] thought I was sleeping you had your arm
[22:41] around your pillow and you were mumbling
[22:43] who is next now if you'll just believe
[22:46] because the angel told me if I could get
[22:48] people to people to believe Bill I'm
[22:51] worried about you outside a car drove up
[22:56] it sounded like an old car the engine
[22:59] idle roughly causing the fenders to
[23:00] rattle from the vibrations someone
[23:03] knocked on the front door made a touch
[23:05] Bill's eyelids with her fingers and
[23:07] gently pulled them shut she said I'll
[23:09] tell them come back tomorrow you go to
[23:11] sleep dear
[23:12] bill heard a man's voice in the kitchen
[23:14] saying our baby has been sick for a long
[23:16] time it won't stop crying cries day and
[23:19] night the doctor can't figure out why
[23:21] Bill heard the baby making a strange
[23:24] noise sort of a wheezing sound like it
[23:25] was trying to cry but had no energy left
[23:27] to do it the noise didn't even sound
[23:30] human bill heard made us say well I just
[23:32] got built to sleep so I don't want to
[23:35] wake him right now
[23:35] then bill heard another woman say we
[23:38] came from northern Ohio we've traveled
[23:40] all day and all night to get here bill
[23:43] thought how can I sleep with that poor
[23:45] baby suffering in the next room when
[23:47] maybe a prayer could help it he
[23:49] staggered out dressed in his pajamas a
[23:51] 10 week old baby lay on the kitchen
[23:53] table wrapped in a blanket its little
[23:56] face twisted as it feebly tried to cry
[23:58] bill asked everyone to kneel and
[24:01] together they turned their voices to the
[24:03] one who had the power to deliver that
[24:05] suffering child Jesus Christ the baby
[24:08] stopped crying its face relaxed by the
[24:11] time the couple left ten minutes later
[24:13] the baby was cooing and smiling before
[24:16] bill had time to crawl back into bed
[24:17] another car drove bill heard footsteps
[24:20] running toward the house someone pounded
[24:22] on the front door bill without led an
[24:25] excited young man into the kitchen the
[24:27] young man said brother branham my sister
[24:29] has appendicitis she's in bad shape
[24:31] she's scheduled for an operation in
[24:33] Louisville later this morning but now
[24:35] our condition is so bad dad doesn't
[24:37] think she can make the trip to the
[24:38] hospital
[24:39] it's a mountain road real rough we live
[24:41] about 35 miles west of here near mill
[24:43] town we know what God did for Georgy
[24:46] Carter so Dan sent me to see if you
[24:49] would come pray for my sister will you
[24:51] come without a second of hesitation bill
[24:54] said yes let me change into my clothes
[24:57] real quick and then I'll follow you into
[24:58] my car Mayda started to cry
[25:01] honey you'll fall asleep somewhere no
[25:04] I'll be all right sweetheart bill
[25:05] reassured her his confidence sagged
[25:08] after a dozen miles his eyelids felt as
[25:10] heavy as lead sinkers sometimes he
[25:13] pinched himself to keep his senses
[25:14] sometimes he bit his finger he even spit
[25:17] on his fingers and wiped the spittle
[25:18] into his eyes trying to ward off sleep
[25:20] the young man was right about the
[25:23] terrible condition of the roads
[25:24] especially the last few miles were the
[25:26] road narrowed into two tire tracks
[25:27] between fences and snake back and forth
[25:30] up the mountainside at least now he
[25:32] didn't have to worry about falling
[25:33] asleep since the road jerked him smartly
[25:35] every time his tire hit a rock were
[25:37] dropped into a Rudd the two cars parked
[25:39] outside a farmhouse after meeting the
[25:42] father and mother Bill followed them to
[25:44] the bedside of a girl about 18 years old
[25:46] her pale skin glistened with beads of
[25:49] sweat or
[25:49] on her temples she showed bill her
[25:51] swollen side the girl's father said she
[25:54] hasn't eaten in three days
[25:56] today she couldn't even hold water down
[25:58] she's supposed to be operated on later
[26:00] this morning an ambulance is supposed to
[26:02] come in a few hours to get her but she's
[26:04] gotten so much worse tonight that now
[26:06] I'm afraid she can't make the trip bill
[26:09] understood appendicitis having watched
[26:11] his friend Sam Adair operate on patients
[26:13] several times
[26:14] this girl's appendix if it was about to
[26:17] rupture and it certainly looked like it
[26:19] was then she went most likely not
[26:21] survived the 40 mile trip to New Albany
[26:23] those first few miles alone would murder
[26:25] her nervously the girl asked old brother
[26:28] branham do you think I'll live choosing
[26:32] his words carefully bill answered I
[26:34] believe you will if you have enough
[26:37] faith do you believe that Jesus Christ
[26:39] can heal you her answer rushed out in a
[26:42] jittery burst oh yes I believe my church
[26:46] says the days of miracles are past but I
[26:48] don't care what my church says I believe
[26:50] Georgy Carter got well I'll get well too
[26:53] I'm scared of the operation having seen
[26:58] thousands of healings and miracles over
[26:59] the past six months bill saw through the
[27:01] girls nervous confession of faith to
[27:03] doubt to the doubt and fear that lay
[27:05] underneath sister I do not mean to hurt
[27:07] your feelings but you do not believe
[27:10] ordinarily there would be enough time
[27:14] for me to let you take what little faith
[27:16] you've got and let you try to believe
[27:17] for your healing but this is an
[27:20] emergency you've got to believe right
[27:22] now or I'll be honest with you you'll
[27:25] not live to see the hospital neither the
[27:28] girl nor her parents appreciated his
[27:29] frankness but bill couldn't help that
[27:32] the situation was urgent he decided he
[27:35] had to try something radical in order to
[27:37] for her to catch the idea bill sat on
[27:40] one side of the girls bed decide nearest
[27:42] to the center of the room her parents
[27:44] and a few friends stood on the other
[27:45] side of her bed the side nearest to the
[27:47] wall in the center of the ceiling glowed
[27:50] an electric light a string hung down
[27:53] from the light cover suspending a red
[27:55] and white bracelet halfway between the
[27:57] ceiling and the floor bill didn't know
[28:00] why this bracelet was hanging there
[28:02] unless perhaps it was used to amuse the
[28:03] baby that was in the house now he
[28:06] figured this bracelet would serve his
[28:07] purpose well Bilson
[28:10] all your adults need to turn around and
[28:12] face the wall then he said to the girl
[28:14] how far away do you think that bracelet
[28:17] is about 15 feet wide you're telling me
[28:22] that you have faith to believe for all
[28:24] things I want to prove I want you to
[28:26] prove it to me I want you to look at
[28:29] that bracelet and I want you to make it
[28:30] swing around and around on the string
[28:32] then I want you to make it swing back
[28:35] and forth then stop it still if you can
[28:38] do that then I'll know you have faith
[28:40] enough for a miracle the girl surprised
[28:43] mingled with her disappointment
[28:45] oh brother branham my why would you ask
[28:48] me to do something like that
[28:49] no one can do that oh yes bill said
[28:53] anyone can that believes jesus said all
[28:57] things are possible if you believe she
[29:00] still remains skeptical but Jesus was
[29:03] talking about spiritual things this is
[29:05] material could you do it yes ma'am
[29:08] could I see it done if you desire just
[29:12] keep your eyes on that bracelet bill
[29:15] fastened his own eyes on the object and
[29:17] concentrated his faith by now he had
[29:19] seen God performed so many miracles that
[29:21] he knew all things were indeed possible
[29:23] through faith in a moment the bracelet
[29:26] began to circle on the end of the string
[29:28] then begin to swing back and forth like
[29:30] a pendulum then it stopped the girl
[29:33] gasped brother branham that spiritualism
[29:37] I thought you might say something like
[29:39] that no it's not spiritualism it's faith
[29:43] now spiritualist used that many times to
[29:45] play pranks bust glasses bend spoons and
[29:48] so forth but it is still just faith the
[29:52] girl could not grasp what he was saying
[29:54] I belong to the Church of Christ we
[29:58] speak where the Bible speaks and were
[30:00] silent where the Bible is silent and
[30:01] there is nothing like that in the Bible
[30:04] sure it's in the Bible bill said
[30:06] remember one morning how Jesus went up
[30:08] to a fig tree looking for some fruit
[30:10] when he didn't find any he put a curse
[30:12] on it the tree began to will
[30:15] when he came back in by in the evening
[30:17] the tree had withered to death
[30:19] Peter remarked how quickly it had
[30:21] happened in jesus answered by saying
[30:23] that not only could you do what he did
[30:25] to the fig tree but if you say to this
[30:28] mountain be moved and don't doubt in
[30:30] your heart by and by it would come to
[30:32] pass didn't he say it sure he did I know
[30:36] your pastors just trying to justify his
[30:38] unbelief by saying that was a mountain
[30:40] of sin that Jesus was talking about but
[30:42] it was the Mount of Olives he said it
[30:45] just took faith as a grain of a mustard
[30:48] seed now if that little bit of pure
[30:51] faith can move a mountain
[30:52] how much smaller faith would you need to
[30:55] move that bracelet the girl lay
[30:57] contemplating each labor breath made her
[31:00] wince bill decided to try another
[31:03] approach look sister an angel came to me
[31:06] five months ago and told me that before
[31:08] I was born I was four ordained by God to
[31:11] take a gift of the vine healing to the
[31:13] people I stood face to face with a
[31:15] supernatural being and he told me if I
[31:18] could get two people to believe me and
[31:20] be sincere when I pray nothing would
[31:22] stand before the prayer if you will
[31:25] believe with all your heart that's what
[31:27] will move God your faith will save you
[31:30] not what you've worked up in your mind
[31:32] but what you really believe the girl
[31:37] answered brother Branham I know that
[31:40] there is something above where I have
[31:41] reached God have mercy on me I will try
[31:45] with all my heart to believe in him
[31:47] taking hold of her right hand bill
[31:49] watched his own left hand swell read to
[31:51] the pounding of unseen vibrations he a
[31:53] touch appendicitis before and was
[31:55] familiar with the pattern of white welts
[31:57] that formed on the back of his hand by
[32:00] the intensity of the vibrations alone he
[32:03] could tell that this case was severe as
[32:05] he asked the Lord Jesus to intervene
[32:07] throbbing the throbbing in the left arm
[32:09] diminished and then disappeared his left
[32:12] hand returned to normal
[32:13] bill said god bless you sister your
[32:15] faith has saved you amidst the joy and
[32:18] relief that passed through the room bill
[32:19] sat down and instantly fell asleep a few
[32:22] hours later he woke up with sunshine in
[32:24] his face the father said good morning in
[32:27] enthusiastically shook bills
[32:29] and things I called the ambulance and
[32:31] told them that there was no need for
[32:33] them to come since my daughter is
[32:34] completely healed the girl was out of
[32:37] bed now sitting at a kitchen table
[32:38] eating ice cream I feel great brother
[32:40] branham the swelling is all gone from my
[32:42] side and there's not a bit of pain left
[32:44] and I'm so hungry god bless you
[32:49] [Applause]

[51:42] in the year that King Uzziah died I saw
[51:46] also the Lord sitting upon a throne high
[51:50] and lifted up and his train filled the
[51:53] temple above it stood the seraphim's
[51:56] each one had six wings with twain he
[52:00] covered his face and with twain he
[52:02] covered his feet and with twain he did
[52:04] fly now this third verse is the verse
[52:06] that i want you guys to really pay

[52:10] and said holy holy holy is the lord of
[52:15] hosts the whole earth is full of his
[52:19] glory amen you guys can have a seat
[52:22] now the first question that I'm going to
[52:24] ask is what was the chapter and verses
[52:26] that I just read an ayah
[52:31] I like it you're still gonna get a prize
[52:37] does anybody else want to answer what
[52:39] was it the chapter the book of the Bible
[52:41] in verse that I just read go ahead what
[52:48] was that
[52:49] which book of the Bible chapter verses
[52:58] one through three perfect alright so you

[53:03] so after church you can come out and
[53:05] then we'll be handing your prizes to you
[53:07] okay so if you guys can greet your
[53:10] neighbor smile at them say god bless you
[53:13] let's loosen up a little bit because we
[53:15] are brothers and sisters in Christ
[53:17] the person on your right is not your
[53:19] enemy the person on your left is not
[53:21] your enemy I'm not your enemy I'm your
[53:23] brother in Christ I'll pray for me pray
[53:26] pray for each other
[53:28] amen so again the verse is holy holy
[53:33] holy is the Lord I want to talk about
[53:35] what is holiness God is holy here we
[53:39] have in the scriptures the angels saying
[53:41] God is holy holy holy or what does that
[53:44] mean as we can see here God is walking
[53:47] down the aisle God is holy he is not
[53:50] like you he has set apart he is perfect
[53:54] he is clean he is without sin I'm gonna
[53:58] read a quote from brother Branham God
[54:00] requires perfect holiness no one can
[54:04] stand in his image with one little speck
[54:08] of sin
[54:09] just one little speck of sin whether it
[54:12] was you told a little lie you stole the
[54:15] car whatever it is one little speck of
[54:18] sin you cannot stand in the presence of
[54:20] God Jim Jesus witnessed the same and
[54:23] said be perfect just like God in heaven
[54:27] is perfect now this message is going to
[54:30] be a simple message it's nothing
[54:33] complicated the message is going to be
[54:35] the gospel of Jesus Christ which anybody
[54:37] can understand from the youngest one to
[54:39] the oldest one because really we're all
[54:41] children of God we're all we're all show
[54:45] of God and we need we all need to hear
[54:48] the gospel we need to share the gospel
[54:50] and the big question that I have is when
[54:53] I was younger was when people say Jesus
[54:55] died for your sins Jesus died for your
[54:57] sins
[54:58] amen amen everyone's crying but what
[55:01] does that mean what does Jesus Christ
[55:04] died for your sins you know what does
[55:06] that mean when you think about it
[55:08] what does that mean is you know people
[55:11] say gospel is the good news okay Jesus
[55:13] Christ died for my sins it's good news
[55:16] what does that mean it took me a little
[55:18] bit of my testimony 26 years to
[55:20] understand what that meant and for the
[55:23] little ones for the oldest one when I
[55:24] understood it when it clicked my whole
[55:27] life changed okay I was a crate I was
[55:29] crazy in the mind I remember driving
[55:31] past who and this is good because before
[55:35] you know for the little kids I never
[55:37] used to cry and ever used to do anything
[55:39] but God changed my life when I would
[55:40] drive past the the mental institution I
[55:43] told myself I belong in there but nobody
[55:45] knows that's what I and that's the truth
[55:48] I would drive on McDowell and you know
[55:50] the the mental to to Shania and I knew I
[55:54] belonged in there in my mind and I know
[55:56] there might be somebody here who's going
[55:59] crazy right here you might look pretty
[56:00] and perfect but you we need God we need
[56:05] Jesus Christ we need the gospel so God
[56:07] is holy kind of a question that I hear
[56:12] somebody speak about was what's closer
[56:14] to God a worm or an angel
[56:17] the answer is neither because God is so
[56:20] different
[56:21] he is so set apart from everything else
[56:23] he's the creator of the universe he's
[56:25] everything he a worm an angel can't even
[56:28] compare they are so different but when
[56:30] you compare it to God there is no
[56:32] comparison God is holy so right now
[56:37] we're gonna have two sinners come up our
[56:41] first sinner right here right in the
[56:43] back he has a lot of sin you can see
[56:47] he's wearing
[56:47] he's tattered up it looks like he's
[56:51] stole from his mom's wallet last night
[56:53] he disobeyed his mom
[56:57] he told lies he's done a lot of bad
[57:01] things a lot of bad things
[57:04] he yelled back at his mom he took the
[57:08] name of the Lord he took God's name in
[57:11] vain
[57:12] I have another question for a prize who
[57:15] can tell me one of the Ten Commandments
[57:17] just one Hanna perfect good job good job
[57:24] round of applause for Hanna for being
[57:26] brave so this first dinner right here
[57:32] he's done a lot of bad things you can
[57:34] tell again he's yelled at his parents
[57:38] he's disobeyed he's lied he's done a lot
[57:41] of bad things in a life and let's see
[57:42] what the Word of God says about people
[57:46] who have done things like this if you
[57:47] can turn your scriptures to first
[57:49] Corinthians chapter 6 verse 9 through 11
[57:59] right now let's see let's see if he can
[58:02] stand in the presence of God with all
[58:05] this sin can he stand in the presence of
[58:07] God so 1st Corinthians chapter 6 verse 9
[58:11] through 11 know ye not that the
[58:15] unrighteous shall not inherit the
[58:17] kingdom of God be not deceived neither
[58:21] fornicators nor idolaters nor adulterers
[58:25] nor effeminate nor abusers of themselves
[58:28] with mankind nor thieves nor covetous
[58:30] nor drunkards nor revilers nor
[58:32] extortioners shall inherit the kingdom
[58:35] of God and such were some of you but ye
[58:39] are washed but ye are sanctified but ye
[58:41] are justified in the name of the Lord
[58:43] Jesus and by the spirit of our God
[58:48] so do do we think that he can stand in
[58:51] the presence of God be in his kingdom no
[58:55] right amen amen I like that got some
[59:00] answers it's good now let's look at this
[59:05] guy he's wearing he it's a nice clean
[59:09] robe
[59:11] whoa he's song led last Friday he
[59:14] actually song lit well not okay well
[59:16] well scratch that so he did all he's
[59:19] done a lot of good things he's fed the
[59:21] poor
[59:22] he's obeyed his parents she's grown up
[59:25] in the message do you guys think he can
[59:29] stand in the presence of God or live
[59:31] with him for all eternity well okay well
[59:36] let's see him let's see him you know
[59:38] make a case I mean he looks pretty clean
[59:43] to me to doing the works that you
[59:54] commanded me to I've fed some poor I've
[1:00:01] gone and prayed for some sick people
[1:00:03] visited them I try to comfort those that
[1:00:08] need a comfort and I've lived a good and
[1:00:16] good life can I join you now let's read
[1:00:21] the scripture and let's see
[1:00:24] you know let's see what the scripture
[1:00:25] says about everybody so Romans you can
[1:00:28] turn to Romans 3:23 and then we'll be
[1:00:31] turning to Romans 3:10 but Romans 3:23
[1:00:36] does anybody have or does anybody want
[1:00:38] to read the scripture a brave soul at
[1:00:41] anion okay
[1:00:50] glory amen that's that's two prizes for
[1:00:54] him
[1:00:55] thank you out a night thank you we're
[1:01:00] all have fallen short and fault yeah for
[1:01:02] all have fallen short of the glory of
[1:01:03] God Romans 3:10 says that no one is
[1:01:07] righteous there is no one that does good
[1:01:10] and I like this at the end of that verse
[1:01:11] you can hear somebody coming in and
[1:01:14] saying wait this guy he did this you fed
[1:01:18] the poor he preached she song lead he
[1:01:21] did all these good things it anticipates
[1:01:24] that one person who comes in and says
[1:01:26] but look at this guy then the scripture
[1:01:28] says no there's no one there's no one
[1:01:31] that doeth good nobody nobody does good
[1:01:35] and it's so simple once you get that
[1:01:39] you're good but anyways there's no one
[1:01:42] that does good Psalms 51 5 if we can
[1:01:47] turn to Psalms 51 5 I could just read it
[1:01:56] behold and sin was a shapen and in my
[1:02:00] man in iniquity let me pull it up
[1:02:06] [Music]
[1:02:13] behold I was shapen in iniquity and in
[1:02:15] sin did my mother conceive me so as we
[1:02:19] heard been hearing in the messages on
[1:02:20] Wednesday but how pastor Bernie says
[1:02:23] when were you condemned before you were
[1:02:26] born so just for everyone to get that
[1:02:29] thought just when were you condemned
[1:02:30] before you were born for the kids if
[1:02:33] everyone can repeat after me when were
[1:02:35] you condemned before I was even born
[1:02:40] when after you were born amen just to
[1:02:53] get that in your head before we were
[1:02:55] born we were already condemned we were
[1:02:57] guilty
[1:02:58] we had sinned and do you see that little
[1:03:01] stain right there at that black stain
[1:03:03] that's where he was born with you
[1:03:06] couldn't do anything about it
[1:03:08] everybody was born with that you you me
[1:03:14] I was born with that that stain right
[1:03:16] there we were all born in a quote from
[1:03:20] brother Branham and the Bible declares
[1:03:22] that we are all born in sin shaped and
[1:03:26] iniquity come to the world speaking lies
[1:03:28] in the presence of God right here he
[1:03:31] says the archbishop but you can put in
[1:03:33] anybody you can put in your daddy your
[1:03:35] pastor or the ministers whoever you want
[1:03:37] to put in that you think is good brother
[1:03:39] I'll me anybody right here says the
[1:03:42] archbishop but put in anybody you want
[1:03:44] to the archbishop borned in this world
[1:03:46] was as guilty as the lowest barfly in
[1:03:50] the city so we're all on the same boat
[1:03:55] so let's all pray for each other you
[1:03:57] pray for me you pray for your little
[1:04:00] ones amen
[1:04:03] so say is that does that sound like good
[1:04:06] news or bad news bad news very bad news
[1:04:12] very bad news because no one can live
[1:04:15] with God for all eternity we all fall
[1:04:17] short of the glory of God we have all
[1:04:20] the evidence right here in the scripture
[1:04:21] saying we're not worthy we're guilty you
[1:04:25] know if you stand in front
[1:04:26] the judge and you've done a crime okay I
[1:04:29] you know say you stole something and the
[1:04:31] judge looks at you and you plead oh can
[1:04:33] i I did all these good things judges
[1:04:35] even say okay yeah maybe you did but you
[1:04:38] still committed this crime you have to
[1:04:39] pay the price for this crime and that's
[1:04:43] bad news right
[1:04:45] because if there's two sides of the coin
[1:04:48] there's a heads and a tails there's a
[1:04:51] heaven and there's a and I think
[1:04:54] sometimes we're too scared to talk about
[1:04:55] you know the latter about it's all
[1:04:58] having everybody's going heaven but I
[1:05:00] think we do have to preach the whole
[1:05:02] truth because a lie is 99% the the truth
[1:05:07] and 1% why so we have to talk about the
[1:05:11] other side especially for the little
[1:05:12] ones as well so we can understand what
[1:05:15] did god save me from he say really as we
[1:05:19] can see here he saved me and we're gonna
[1:05:21] see what God did but he saved us from
[1:05:24] himself because he's a judge and we're
[1:05:27] gonna stand before the judge one day
[1:05:29] that's what he saved us from from
[1:05:32] himself now if we can put up the YouTube
[1:05:36] video of the Old Testament sacrifice
[1:05:40] they can get it up there you can turn
[1:05:42] the audio low I'm just gonna read a
[1:05:44] quote from brother Branham kind of
[1:05:45] describing the situation
[1:05:57] alright so under the Old Testament the
[1:06:00] law was when a man sinned he brought the
[1:06:03] lamb to the altar say if he transgressed
[1:06:05] any of the commandments she brought the
[1:06:06] lamb and he laid it on the altar he laid
[1:06:08] his hands upon the lamb and he confessed
[1:06:10] his sins that he was wronged and knowed
[1:06:14] he was guilty
[1:06:15] the law requires death and he brought
[1:06:18] the lamb in his stead the throat of the
[1:06:21] little lamb was cut and it began begin
[1:06:24] to kick its little feet and bleeding
[1:06:26] right here you can see what brother
[1:06:28] branham's talking about the little lamb
[1:06:30] took his place that spotless lamb that
[1:06:36] clean lamb took his place and don't
[1:06:40] worry it won't show anything so don't
[1:06:42] have to close your eyes the sinner
[1:06:45] recognized that's way for this part to
[1:06:48] come just so you can really get it in so
[1:06:52] the sinner recognized that this little
[1:06:54] lamb died in his place
[1:06:58] something had to die but when man walked
[1:07:03] away he still had the same sinful
[1:07:06] desires so now we're gonna see what God
[1:07:10] did you know we have the the lamb being
[1:07:15] slain but something happened after all
[1:07:18] those sacrifices used to be done but
[1:07:20] something happened it happened after God
[1:07:23] he came down if you guys can turn to
[1:07:26] John 1:1 in the States in the beginning
[1:07:35] was the word and the Word was with God
[1:07:39] this is God right and the Word was God
[1:07:44] glory and now John 1:14 you go down to
[1:07:48] John 1:14 and the word which is God
[1:07:53] became flesh
[1:07:55] he became flesh like me like angel but
[1:07:59] like brother Mike brother Bernie he
[1:08:01] became flesh and he dwelt among us amen
[1:08:08] so God he came down he became flesh and
[1:08:13] what did he do let's see what he did now
[1:08:22] if we can turn to Hebrews 10:17 like I
[1:08:26] mentioned in the quote before why you
[1:08:28] guys turned to the Scriptures at the end
[1:08:30] of the brother bambuco when I was
[1:08:32] talking about the video that man he
[1:08:36] still had the same desires so when he
[1:08:38] walked away from the lamb nothing
[1:08:41] changed he still wanted to steal to have
[1:08:45] that thoughts you still wanted to lie to
[1:08:47] his parents to be disobedient he still
[1:08:50] wanted to you know do all these good
[1:08:53] things and still live a double life do
[1:08:54] whatever you wanted to do he still
[1:08:56] walked away with the same desires but
[1:08:59] Hebrews 10:17 in the Hebrews chapter 10
[1:09:02] kind of give a summary but I'll read the
[1:09:04] verse verse and their sins and
[1:09:06] iniquities will I remember no more so
[1:09:14] this verse right here this is the verse
[1:09:17] where it clicked for me brother Caleb
[1:09:18] was here Caleb do-don I was struggling
[1:09:21] for so long I had done something wrong
[1:09:23] it was small but in God's eyes you can
[1:09:26] see even if you stumble in one offense
[1:09:29] you're guilty of everything and I
[1:09:33] couldn't I was going through something
[1:09:34] that I had done and I was going crazy
[1:09:37] and crazy and crazy for one little thing
[1:09:39] just I want you guys to realize that
[1:09:42] that one little thing maybe you did it
[1:09:44] when you're right now ten twelve years
[1:09:46] old they can follow you your whole life
[1:09:48] and then God brings it back brings you
[1:09:50] to a point of depression anxiety and
[1:09:53] craziness you realize what he did for
[1:09:56] you right here in your sins everything
[1:09:58] bad you've done and iniquities will I
[1:10:00] remember no more and he will give you a
[1:10:04] new heart a flat of a heart of a fleshly
[1:10:07] heart he'll take away the evil
[1:10:10] desires all the things you want to do
[1:10:13] you know nowadays you we have it's it's
[1:10:15] just taught you know you got to do good
[1:10:17] things you got to do good things you got
[1:10:18] a you know all these you know
[1:10:21] motivational speeches and you know all
[1:10:23] the kids are on YouTube you know they
[1:10:24] see people talking about yeah if you you
[1:10:26] know if you run five miles a day your
[1:10:29] life will be forever changed nothing is
[1:10:32] going to change you nothing is gonna
[1:10:34] change you eventually you're gonna crack
[1:10:36] under the pressure only Jesus Christ can
[1:10:38] take can change you and right here his
[1:10:41] scripture says God doesn't even remember
[1:10:44] them so right now anything that the
[1:10:47] devil is just telling you you did this
[1:10:49] you remember we do this you're not
[1:10:50] worthy enough you just quote the word go
[1:10:53] read your Bible you know kids you know
[1:10:56] Muslim kids when they're six seven years
[1:10:58] old they memorized the whole Quran the
[1:11:01] whole Quran and we you know as you know
[1:11:03] sometimes we struggle just to memorize a
[1:11:05] few verses a day it's the Word of God
[1:11:07] it's life we spend so much time on
[1:11:09] YouTube Facebook I'm guilty I'm not
[1:11:12] talking about anybody here but me when I
[1:11:14] could be studying the word growing as a
[1:11:17] Christian getting revelation being happy
[1:11:20] like the song that my brother angels
[1:11:22] saying Oh what needless pain we bear Oh
[1:11:26] what needless you know our little ones
[1:11:29] go through a lot we don't realize it but
[1:11:31] the world right now when I go to the mom
[1:11:34] I gotta go with the bag over my head
[1:11:36] these kids they go through a lot in
[1:11:38] school so let's pray for them let's get
[1:11:41] them in the word
[1:11:49] so what is Jesus Christ doing right here
[1:11:52] Jesus Christ he came down in the flesh
[1:11:54] he took away the sins of the world John
[1:11:58] 3:16 for God so loved the world that He
[1:12:01] gave His only begotten Son that
[1:12:02] whosoever shall believe in Him shall not
[1:12:05] perish but have everlasting life you see
[1:12:10] he took away he took away his sin do you
[1:12:15] see that little black mark on him he's
[1:12:19] gone now now now let's see where he
[1:12:23] takes him that's all of our burden all
[1:12:31] your depression all of your lies
[1:12:33] everything all your anxiety your just
[1:12:37] everything that's bothering you all your
[1:12:39] worries are all your worries like oh how
[1:12:41] am I gonna pay this how am I gonna pay
[1:12:43] this or or or my son or my or my my
[1:12:47] daughter
[1:12:47] there goes it's it see it's so simple
[1:12:53] anybody can get it oh why did you just
[1:12:55] Christ died for your sins I'll tell you
[1:12:56] why because he took your sins oh he's
[1:12:59] going to take your sins away that's why
[1:13:01] he's going away with your sins alright
[1:13:07] question where where are are you where
[1:13:10] are your sins at I like you know what I
[1:13:15] like that how brother BAM talked about
[1:13:17] he he took him back to the accuser
[1:13:20] that's three prizes for a denial amen so
[1:13:23] Ken can you see any sin up here no sin
[1:13:27] and your sins and iniquities will I
[1:13:31] remember no more so isn't that good news
[1:13:38] that's good news right
[1:13:42] now look at this now Jesus Christ is
[1:13:47] coming and he's gonna he's putting his
[1:13:50] righteousness on him let's turn to
[1:13:52] Isaiah chapter 61 verse 10 glory
[1:14:06] so isaiah 61:10 reads this i will
[1:14:11] greatly rejoice in the lord my soul
[1:14:14] shall be joyful in my god he hath
[1:14:17] clothed me with the garments of
[1:14:20] salvation he had covered me with the
[1:14:23] robe of righteousness who as a
[1:14:27] bridegroom dekha themself with ornaments
[1:14:30] and as a bride adorned it herself with
[1:14:33] her jewels look at jesus christ he rose
[1:14:37] from the dead he died with all of our
[1:14:39] sins he came back and I was clothing us
[1:14:42] with righteousness now do we think these
[1:14:45] two people who were sinners do you think
[1:14:48] they can live with God eternally now
[1:14:52] Amen I like the enthusiasm Adonai thank
[1:14:55] you now look at Jesus Christ he died for
[1:15:03] the whole world I like a brother was
[1:15:05] telling me in the back God for God so
[1:15:08] loved the world not the message church
[1:15:11] not people who grew up with brother
[1:15:13] Branham he loved everybody you know the
[1:15:16] person at work when you walk by them
[1:15:18] you're like or at school you're like man
[1:15:21] they are not gonna go to heaven that's
[1:15:24] who we died for remember that kids
[1:15:26] that's what we tied for that's who you
[1:15:27] have to love not just just be in a
[1:15:31] little group you know it's not it's it's
[1:15:34] he came for everybody and when you
[1:15:36] realize that when you when you realize
[1:15:39] that then you can truly love everybody
[1:15:41] when when Jesus Christ comes and you
[1:15:43] realize that these guys didn't have to
[1:15:46] do anything did they have to do anything
[1:15:49] there is one thing who said it I heard
[1:15:56] it I think she wants surprise
[1:15:59] believe Wratten amen
[1:16:02] so that is the one thing that we have to
[1:16:04] do is believe if we turn to John chapter
[1:16:08] 3 verse 18 now I you know I'm sorry if
[1:16:12] if it seems like I'm reading a lot of
[1:16:15] the word but that is okay because when
[1:16:18] we you know you know like John 1:1 says
[1:16:20] for everybody for the kids this is you
[1:16:24] know we think of all the superheroes
[1:16:25] Ironman and this and that we think of
[1:16:27] all I superman whatever it may be this
[1:16:31] is the real superhero he's the he's the
[1:16:34] crew he's the creator of the universe
[1:16:37] and this is him speaking right here so
[1:16:42] this is what we should be spending our
[1:16:43] time in I remember I don't have anybody
[1:16:45] in my mind just myself if you want just
[1:16:50] all your cares all your worries spend
[1:16:52] time with God and you realized oh wait I
[1:16:53] don't have to worry I don't have to care
[1:16:56] oh wait I can depend on God all this
[1:16:58] needless pain I bear I don't see it on
[1:17:02] Jesus anymore I don't see I don't see it
[1:17:04] on him it's back with the accuser like
[1:17:07] my brother
[1:17:07] Ananias says so John 3:18 does anybody
[1:17:13] want to read it my brother
[1:17:41] amen thank you thank you for that
[1:17:44] brother so let's read it again he that
[1:17:47] believeth on him so he that believeth on
[1:17:50] who Jesus Christ right is not condemned
[1:17:54] but he that believeth not is condemned
[1:17:56] already so I'm sure we all know the
[1:18:00] story but sometimes we have to hear
[1:18:02] something because I'm sure I heard the
[1:18:03] gospel
[1:18:04] thousands of time times but I didn't get
[1:18:07] it tossed 26 so sometimes with the hear
[1:18:10] it over and over and over until it's
[1:18:12] like boom it clicks in your head yes yes
[1:18:17] until it clicks in your head so the
[1:18:20] story of the soldier back in the times
[1:18:22] of Abraham Lincoln when he retreated
[1:18:27] because he was scared they sent him to
[1:18:28] prison because it was a crime so he was
[1:18:30] sentenced to die what happened he had a
[1:18:34] friend who didn't want him to die so he
[1:18:36] he went to Abraham Lincoln said hey this
[1:18:38] is the situation this is what happening
[1:18:40] he was scared he's a young man and just
[1:18:45] you know you know not you know not to
[1:18:47] get sidetracked but it doesn't matter
[1:18:51] how young they are whether you're five
[1:18:52] six seven eight they understand and they
[1:18:55] can really comprehend things you know
[1:18:58] back in World War two that we're sending
[1:19:00] kids who were well very young your
[1:19:02] people would sign up illegally but
[1:19:04] people kids were doing amazing things in
[1:19:07] the scriptures you look at King David
[1:19:09] you look at all the young ones what did
[1:19:11] they do strength is in the youth the you
[1:19:18] know the the the children so we have the
[1:19:21] friend he went to Abraham Lincoln
[1:19:22] Abraham
[1:19:23] you know Lincoln he saw the situation
[1:19:25] okay he signed ok he's released and the
[1:19:28] friend goes back he goes back and say
[1:19:30] hey look at Abraham Lincoln signed your
[1:19:33] pardon you're free to go cuz he was
[1:19:36] sentenced to die the next day by a
[1:19:38] firing squad pretty much being shot by
[1:19:40] multiple people that's what a firing
[1:19:42] squad is okay and his friend came and
[1:19:45] say look your partner you free dude and
[1:19:47] the guy was like Lincoln sometimes
[1:19:53] we just can't grasp that the creator of
[1:19:57] the universe the one who made everything
[1:20:00] he put the Stars in place he he did he
[1:20:03] gave me breath of lie he gave me breath
[1:20:04] he gave me children he he took on my
[1:20:08] worry he he said I'm free yeah
[1:20:12] that's it no no no and that's that and
[1:20:16] that's what I did for a long time of my
[1:20:18] life and I think that's what a lot of us
[1:20:19] have done with you have to realize that
[1:20:22] Christianity is the only true
[1:20:24] Christianity there's a lot of
[1:20:25] denominations out there
[1:20:26] true Christianity for all the young ones
[1:20:29] and everyone is the only religion to
[1:20:31] where you don't have to do anything to
[1:20:35] live with God eternally the Muslims the
[1:20:38] Mormons the Catholic it's all you have
[1:20:40] to do do do do do in order to live with
[1:20:43] God now that's a spirit and obviously it
[1:20:45] has affected a lot of people of okay
[1:20:47] yeah I came to church you know on time
[1:20:49] and I need to come to church on time but
[1:20:52] you know you know we I have to do this I
[1:20:55] have to do this I have to do that when
[1:20:57] you just realize that Abraham Lincoln
[1:20:59] signed you free that Jesus Christ said
[1:21:02] you know what all your sins are gone
[1:21:04] there with the accuser I I don't see
[1:21:08] them and I can't repeat this enough but
[1:21:11] it's so important because that's how I
[1:21:12] was when I came to the revelation
[1:21:14] because Jesus Christ he already died he
[1:21:16] don't have to die again he doesn't have
[1:21:18] to die again he's already dead so once
[1:21:20] you realize that everything went goes
[1:21:24] away depression and why I mentioned
[1:21:25] depression because I was depressed I
[1:21:27] wanted to kill myself you know how many
[1:21:29] young people young kids I know this is
[1:21:31] children's church but do you know how
[1:21:32] many young kids like talk about suicide
[1:21:35] and kill themselves and if we don't talk
[1:21:37] about it then they suppress that and
[1:21:39] then they see everybody at church oh
[1:21:41] they're so good good I used to think
[1:21:44] that oh I'm not gonna be you save the
[1:21:45] time 60 years old like brother you don't
[1:21:48] like brother Johnny or brother Michael
[1:21:50] brother Ernie like I I'm gonna make it
[1:21:53] but thing we need to hear that those
[1:21:56] things are real the kids need to hear
[1:21:57] that those things are real and Jesus
[1:22:00] Christ took him away and they don't need
[1:22:02] pills or anything because I'm telling
[1:22:04] you where I was in my mind I was cray
[1:22:07] z yeah I don't know some of you don't
[1:22:10] believe me but I'm telling you I would
[1:22:11] be driving and I want to just run into
[1:22:13] the rail but you know I was taught my
[1:22:15] mom would die you know my parents would
[1:22:17] that they wouldn't live that's the truth
[1:22:20] but Jesus Christ when I when I just had
[1:22:23] it wasn't Oh jumping and shouting when
[1:22:27] he just realized oh my sin and iniquity
[1:22:30] are gone and that's why I felt it wasn't
[1:22:34] like it was just revelation but wherever
[1:22:38] it came from me being in the word trying
[1:22:41] to study no I was studying the word to
[1:22:44] prove Mormons wrong hey you can't work
[1:22:46] your way to heaven and the word was
[1:22:49] talking to me so amen
[1:22:53] so that's the gospel that is the good
[1:22:55] news that's why Jesus had to die for us
[1:22:58] because if he didn't as you saw this
[1:23:01] young fine gentleman he was born in sin
[1:23:03] he was born in saying all of us were
[1:23:05] born in sin your pastor was born in sin
[1:23:07] even brother Branham was born in sin
[1:23:10] because he needed a savior right brother
[1:23:13] Branham needed a savior brother
