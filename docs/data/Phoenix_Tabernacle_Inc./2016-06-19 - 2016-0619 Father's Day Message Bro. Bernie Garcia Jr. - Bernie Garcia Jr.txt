forever many times we doubt the present we believe in the the past and many times we forget about the future but if we believe that there lies are the answer to of our if we believe with all our hearts that the Lord Jesus Christ was the same one who paid the price on Calvary for every sickness every need he is the same present today to give us the solution with all your heart if you have a need and want to indicate it by raising your hand truly and today today is the true father because every day is a Father's Day it's the day that we should honor our heavenly father why don't we give him that honor to our Heavenly Father to believe him with all our hearts and tell him Lord you are my father I may not have a physical father but your promise said that you will never abandon us you will never leave us or that tells us that we have a father and that is the father of fathers the one who answers our needs if you pleased by your as we pray for these petitions and for every petition that you have all you need to do is believe our heavenly father and for offerings and [Music] tithings let's bow our heads and [Music] pray let's take our time to clear our [Music] thoughts so we can recognize where we're at in whose presence we we're [Music] in Heavenly Father we come before you in the name of Jesus Christ to the one who loved us and washed our sins in his own blood the ones whose names were written in the Lamb's Book of Life to the ones who you sent the Redeemer to come and [Music] rescue we come before you father thanking you for everything that you've done for us what a privileged people we [Music] are you have sent your word Lord and the prophet said that that in this day that that promise word would catch us and it would come to us and would restore us back into our original condition what a privilege that is Lord to come into recognition that we were truly in you before the foundation of the world and we find ourselves here today in this condition that we find ourselves in Lord but there's something on the inside that pulsates and cl and and cries out to you knowing that you could meet every need that we have Lord that no matter what it is that if we would just believe it that it was truly come to pass father father we pray for these petitions that were read this morning for the Brethren who are uh hospitalized and those that need healing of the body Lord if there's one thing that I've learned over the years of my health issues is that not to let nothing stop me that to keep that word in front of me at all times and in the right season and at the right time the healing will come the blessings will come everything that you promised would come we thank you for these things father we ask that you bless this offering that we're about to pick

both of them and mostly between the Lord Jesus Christ as I was talking to them yesterday and know asking them a couple of questions and uh I already knew the answers because I talked to their parents and it's something it's something tremendous when when they're obedient to the word of God because then the Lord the hand of the Lord's on them so so we're going to just go right ahead our brother Jesus edos and our our sister Alma Flores Flores they're getting engaged this morning and before we pray for them um I just want to read a scripture it's found in the book of Colossians 3:14 and 15 and it reads as this and above all these things put on love which is the bond of perfectness and let the peace of God ruin your hearts to which also ye are called into one body and be ye thankful and I believe both of them are thankful this morning because besides our Salvation the next thing is is a Perfect Mate right that the Lord blesses you with so so can you face each other you got a ring brother [Music] put [Music] onor amen now we're going to be praying for you guys grab your right hand and and if uh the congregation could just help me pray for them let us bow our heads our heavenly father Lord Jesus first of all we're so thankful Lord for your word Lord Jesus because through your word Lord we understand the meaning of Love Lord and the meaning one of the meanings of Love is that you lay your life down for one another Lord and and I ask you Lord Jesus until the day they come before you Lord and and and get married father Lord that you keep them Lord Jesus that you help them Lord Jesus that your Holy Spirit Guide them in each way Lord Jesus that you help their parents as well Lord Jesus and that you be with them Lord bless them Father Lord we love you so much Lord we present them unto you Lord in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ we thank you amen you can turn around God bless you [Applause] [Music] guys [Music] God bless you [Music] Breen don't think it's two in one [Music] please if you allow me I want to share what God has shown me you don't have to believe me but just please please hear me [Music] out we have here this Prince and this princess I say this because they are the children of the king I believe God has called them to be Kings and Priests this is something that I have never done you say brother you're always presenting couples yes but this is the first time I present somebody from my own house what a gift right I just hope my heart doesn't stop at this [Music] moment but they were uh forced or guided but by that word that we call [Music] love if you allow me to share with you the scripture real quick you want to see a bit about the love that the scripture tells us about in song Solomon Chapter 2 [Music] I am the rose of Sharon and the lily of the valleys as the Lily among Thorns so is my love among the daughters as the apple tree among the Trees of the wood so is my beloved among the sons I sat down under the Shadow with great delight and his fruit fruit was sweet to my taste he brought me to the banqueting house and His Banner Over Me was love say who is she that lookth forth as the morning Fair as the moon clear as the sun and terrible as an army with banners I don't know what's happening but a lot of couples are getting married at these times the Book of Revelations 197 [Music] let us be glad and rejoice and give honor to him for the marriage of the Lamb is come and his wife hath made herself ready and to her was granted that she would be arrayed in fine linen clean and white for for the fine L is the righteousness of saints and he said unto me right blessed are they which are called unto the marriage supper of the lamb and he saith unto me these are the true sayings of God blessed are they that are called to the wedding supper of the Lamb right now we are presently in the Lamb's Wis but blessed are they who are called to the lamps wedding that is a different thing and as I watched the first couple that came up and then seeing this next couple in this uh same day what I think in my mind that God speaks and tells me do not forget that I have a Jewish W uh wife that's waiting for you we were called and God called a gentile bride but he has a group of people that is still waiting for here's our brother Mario and sister yans to me he is a true gentleman and she is a wonderful lady to [Music] me they have made their decisions they have been speaking or talking for some time now and I thank them because they allowed me to be their counselor I'm not only her father but been I've been her counselor uh brother brandham teaches us what H takes place in an engagement and that engagement takes place here at the altar before this reunion be possible we know that at home the man is the word when he asked her if she wish to marry him and she answer if she answered [Music] yes her vote automatically uh made her his wife do you believe that isn't that what brother brandom teaches us it's the same thing with Christ when you decid to give him a vote he is your husband and he is to come back for his beloved uh bride and saying so they are now married because they gave each other their vows or their word but then the ceremony comes they have to wait till the ceremony [Music] and there is where the bride takes the last name of her husband so then she won't have her own that's the reason why [Music] we if you have identified yourself that Christ has called you I can tell you this morning that you are Mrs Jesus Christ and you must behave that way so I plead to God that these two young people that are to begin that they may ask for God's help may they be prepared for the day of their ceremony and after the ceremony begin to live a life that is worthy of the Gospel as a couple one to another but I thank you for being here Brothers I want you to look at her brother hey look at her look at him [Music] yansi do you want to leave the house to go with [Music] Mario I know she's been happy with me I have been happy with [Music] her but I believe she's bound to face a happiness that only this man can give to her and I thank you for being here before the presence of God don't forget the Ring Mario okay [Music] take her by her right hand okay we're going to pray for them brotherr Heavenly [Music] Father Mario here's your son Mario Cano and our sister yans [Music] they are here before your presence and before this congregation to show their love one for another Lord they love each other [Music] Lord and I know that the love between a marriage or a couple is [Music] eternal we ask that you help them Lord we ask that you bless them Lord that you abide in their midst so that love of yours that agape love may help them to face every situation adversaries in life but Lord Lord they as a couple come to ask for your blessing Lord and I Your Name Lord ask for him Lord and I ask Lord that you help them as the day of the ceremony comes Lord we ask that you keep them and may you bless them in all things thank you Lord for the agreement and the the engagement that they have G and we ask all these things in the precious name of the Lord Jesus Christ may the Lord

privilege to be here speaking before you today is this the 19th is today the 19th June the 19th of 2016 is a day we celebrate Father's Day in America sometimes the calendar swims around in my head and um I lose track of the day sometimes I used to be really bad but lately I've been a little better I got a sister who calls me up and reminds me when I'm supposed to be at work God bless sister deborra amen I want to also to uh greet my dad know he's watching on the internet God bless you Daddy happy Father's Day to you and I hope you have a an awesome day today and we'll see you in a in a couple of hours I also wanted to U greet my dad and also the congregation on the behalf of the brothers worldwide missionary Outreach World missionary Outreach we're in the middle of an awesome convention up there in Jano Illinois and I had to had to cut out early left Saturday as late as I could and I came and flew into Phoenix Pho to my dad wanted me to to be here with with you sometimes when you're having a real good time it's hard to leave but it's it's it's very good to be to be obedient brother Daniel Martin and Brother Floyd Patterson send their greetings and their love to you Dad Floyd asked me to greet the church on their behalf and brother Ron Perry also daddy the the pastor of the church there in in Genoa brother Kell PES and brother Tommy PES also send their greetings to you we kind of did a little bit tag team wrestling I guess this time I took the I was there the first days and they got there when I was leaving I said tag you guys got it and so they're they're there with their brothers and they sent uh Happy Father's Day to you also Daddy and to the congregation wishing each one of you a happy Father's Day uh today being Father's Day I found uh thoughts of fathers moving in my heart I was a little surprised because I I've had a thought that's been on my heart for many months and I haven't quite everywhere I go I haven't quite been able to not preach about it I think in Prescott we have probably 17 messages on the subject Faith as a mustard seed but uh as the Lord began to move on my heart about fathers but in particular I was thinking of the founding fathers of our great nation the United States of America uh which reminds me just so that you know I I I full disclosure uh the other day somebody said brother Bernie said are you growing a mustache it's funny because if I grow a beard nobody says anything but if I shave the beard and leave the mustache they they they want to know if I'm a mustache and um I said yes Brothers I have to grow a mustache now why brother I said because last Thursday my dad took me to the Mexican culate and he signed the papers so I can become a Mexican national and you can't be a Mexican and not have a mustache so I um so I'm going to mustache now just so that you know in case you're curious why does brother Bernie have a mustache now so um so my this area is Mexican and the rest of is American amen so we have a great nation here United States of America and uh while we in America we look at our founding fathers I would invite you on in the internet whatever country that you are in to think about the founding fathers of your nation the great man that made your nation able to start those uh great man that formed the Constitution to help stabilize your your situations there uh the founding fathers of of our nation uh are the ones I'm going to talk about today of the United States of America and I like I said don't mean any disrespect to any other country I'm sure that you have your founding fathers also but I don't want to talk about them in a historical context but more in a in a religious context and really maybe only just kind of skimming through it and uh taking some thoughts what brother brandham said and then tying those into some areas that might be relevant to our life to our personal history uh both our present our future our past and just kind of see where the Lord takes us I um I was telling the brothers I'm a little nervous uh don't not usually nervous when I speak but I had this thought that the Lord put in me and I and I I started trying to write it down so I wouldn't forget and I ran that a little bit out of time so I don't have it all written down like I usually would like to have it written down so when we get to the end of the book I'll be as interested to see how the ending is as as maybe you will be and speaking about the our fathers we think of our then the word would be our forefathers which means that they they're they're not our immediate fathers right they were before our fathers and yet our fathers have somehow maintained the teachings of those fathers alive or or the tradition at least has been kept going so we have some kind of a knowledge of who those who those who our ancestry is where where we came from okay so brother Braham says in the message be certain of God he says he's preached in h January the 25th of 1959 says we've got to the place to think that the because we're resting upon what our forefathers did or what Upon Our great founders of our churches what their great sacrifice was to God which is all right and so much appreci so the the first thing that draws my attention with what brother Bram is saying is that when we think of the forefathers we're actually thinking about the founders it could be the founder of a Nation uh the founder of a tribe the founder of a village or of a town so the founders are considered to be our forefathers so you might move into a town let just say Johnsonville Johnsonville was founded by a man named Johnson and if you begin to immerse in the the in the culture of Johnsonville Johson and to ingrain yourself into that uh Community you might find yourself talking about Johnsonville to somebody you might say something like our founder established our city in 1830 or you might be saying when our forefathers lifted up the city hall so you can see that that this term of forefathers or founders doesn't necessarily have to do with where you grew up in or what your lineage is but rather has to do with the degree with which you are willing to identify with the community in which you are living I mean you might have come from Waka but you're identified with Johnsonville and you would say our founder what do you mean your founder you're from Waka oh but I live in Johnsonville Johnsonville it's a it's a matter of identifying and brother Brown is talking about how that we identify with our Founders and our forefathers and what they did but he said we get to a point that we think now he hasn't told us yet what we think but we think that because we are standing or resting upon what those Founders or forefathers have done they're thinking something and their thoughts are based upon the fact are resting on their for Founders what their great sacrifice was to God which is all right how many of you appreciate what your father has done for you I appreciate the things that my father has done for me I appreciate the things that I have seen him do for others you know I was telling the brothers in in in uh in Genoa we sat down at a table having fellowship and the brothers had just arrived from New Mexico and two brothers sat down and they've known me all my life and I've seen them almost all my life I've SE him in all the conventions I see him when we go visit the church over there I see when they come here they they they're very active in their travel and so we sat down to talk and it was the first time in my life that I had sat down and had a conversation with these two brothers I had knew them but I didn't know them and so they they asked me a very strange question it really blew my mind they said Bernie Bernie brother Bernie Bernie how did your dad come into the message I mean I couldn't I it blew my mind how how could these brothers good friends of ours and not know how my dad came into the message so I began to explain to them how that my dad came into the message how he grew up how he met brother Bram how that he ran away from home how that he was in the he was doing a drug run he was crossing Mexico bito Mexico to pick up some drugs across the states when the Holy Spirit came down and said Son don't take these drugs across the border they've ratted you out how many of you have heard the story oh not everybody okay I was going to skip it but I guess maybe I'll tell it it's Father's Day so let's let's uncover a little bit of my Dad's life okay he said he said Son do not take the drugs across the border they're going to be waiting for you at the border now this is the holy spirit talking to my dad a drug dealer he's a drug dealer and the Holy Spirit is talking to him gifts and calling are without what without repentance if he was an apostle once he always was an apostle if God was with him once he always was with him don't be fooled into thinking that God found you but you might have discovered that God was interested in you you might have thought you found God but God has always had you in his hand but Jesus said all that the father have given me are in my hands and the father will not lose one of them so here was the drug dealer about to take drugs across the border and God sends his Spirit to speak to that gift and say son do not take the drugs across the border you say well why are you making so much emphasis on that because that's okay it's the next thing that blows my mind He says Dad say so well what do I do and the spirit tells him throw it across the fence and go back and pick it up from the other [Laughter] side wow wow so he threw the drugs across the border there's a long road that you go across the border when you go into the line and there's desert on the other side they threw it across the border they continued on to the line and as soon as they got into the into the where the booth Booth booths were at there came like flies on honey and there's my dad and all his buddies all high all Mar all drugged up laughing their heads off at these poor guys they knew they weren't going to find nothing cuz they had already been warned to throw it across the border they tore the car apart they brought the dogs they could smell the [Music] marijuana but there was nothing to be found and my dad's laughing his head off at them the whole time they crossed the border they take a drive it took 20 30 minutes to drive to the spot that across where they had throwing the drugs over but says I'll be back boys he gets out and he goes and walks and pick up the drugs he picks up the drugs he's walking back and all of a sudden there's the Migra how do you say Migra in English well now you would call it ice right the bar border patrol right the home front the Border border control people home security homeand Security Homeland Security all around him and there's my dad tall guy six foot about 96 PB he's crouched down by a bush now you think why did God tell him and advise him not to take the drugs across and to throw it across the fence and to pick it up later you think maybe God might have had a plan I think God had a plan so there he is and he's he's there crouching by that bush all around him are the border patrol and think oh God I'm in a I'm I'm I'm in it now and all of the scriptures that his father had taught him and made him learn when he was a we boy began to come back to him as the Holy Spirit began to speak to his gift and give him the words of eternal life that seed that Daddy had planted in my in my dad's heart 12 or 13 years before that had seemed dormant that weren't doing anything but that seed was still there and when the Holy Spirit came to brood upon it and begin to strike those words of Promise of eternal life my dad realized I'm lost everything my dad taught me the word everything that the word of God says but now now it's too late now I'm I'm busted here so crouched down by that bush he said Lord if you'll take me out of this one how many of you have said that before God if you'll take me out of this one I'll serve you if you give me a job Lord I promise this time I'll pay my ti I I promise I I'll give some offering Lord if you help me don't lose my house if you help me get out of this problem we always we like we like to bargain with God we bargue with him with our time with our money with our careers but those things aren't worth anything to God he doesn't move on the scene for those things and my dad when he bargained with God he bargained with his soul in his hand he said if you get me out of this one I promise I'll serve you all the days of my amen amen well they passed all around him I said Dad how did they not see you he said son I don't know how they didn't see me they were right there upon me all around me looking for me and they could not find me said when they gave up I walked back to the car got in the car and we drove off he said I still had that big old bag of drugs with me and he was kind of he kind of laughed when he said this part I said you know how it is son we remember those things that are convenient to us so he says Lord my good daddy taught me not to waste [Music] anything so he had a big party about two weeks party finishing those drugs up because you couldn't going to waste them couldn't sell them right so he he consumed them when he got to the end of that two weeks then the Holy Spirit came and reminded him of his promise and he got up and he was high and they went to the church went to the pastor's house I won't tell that story but he went to the pastor's house and anyways the pastor baptized him he got up out of the baptismal Waters his friends took him home he fell asleep totally drugged out he woke up the next morning and as was his habit reached over to grab his joint they said they used to make them really big not these little small ones that they make big joints everything my dad did he did it full blast so he reached over to grab his joint and as he was going to light he thought he thought that he remembered that he had got baptized the night before so he called his buddies they came into the room he said hey uh did I dream it or did I get baptized last night oh they started laughing yeah you got baptized it was crazy he got up started to put his clothes on I said what are you doing he said I'm going to church what do you mean you're going to church it's the morning he said I got to go get the Holy Ghost he was taught when he was a young boy he he went to the church they were having a prayer service and he walked in there knelt down and he said Lord your scriptures I learned from my daddy your scriptures says that if I repent and be baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ I shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost I've repented I was baptized and now I know that for me to be able to live a Christian Life I can't do it I need for you to give me your spirit amen I fulfilled all the requirements I'm here for you to fill me with the Holy Ghost and right there God filled him with the Holy Ghost AM he was committed he was committed he was surrendered he wasn't holding anything back and he had the scripture to back up his petition amen and from that moment he never touched drug women alcohol do the things of the world from that moment that he received the Holy Ghost he began to serve God what a great Foundation I say it that way the founder of our church has laid for us what a foundation for us to be able to build upon and to be able to say if if he can do it then I can do it because he admitted freely he admitted freely God there's no way that I can live a Christian Life unless you come and give me the Holy Ghost and that's what we need to understand more than anything it doesn't matter how hard you try to live a a certain type of a life there has to be a fundamental change of your nature God has to come in and put his spirit inside of you you must be born again and at the beginning of his walk he understood this from the scriptures that his fathers had taught him the scriptures that my forefather taught him amen amen we cannot brother bram's continuing we appreciate their great sacrifice but we cannot draw salvation from what they did salvation is an individual Affair between every person and God not with our nation not with our church but with ourselves before God amen amen in the message of the breach brother brah says our our national Spirit Frolic Frolic having fun we always want to be playing jokes you know why we were founded upon the doctrine of the Apostles we were founding upon leadership of Great Men like Washington Washington Lincoln Lincoln but we have moved off that foundation and we know that we've got it coming so so here now now he's talking about our founding and he's TI it with the doctrines of the Apostles so in my my mind when I hear this I think fathers forefathers Founders Apostles to me they're like cinnamons when you talk about an apostle about a Founder talking about an apostle somebody who has placed it in order like the Apostle Paul said I like a Chief Architect have laid down the foundation he he's the founder he put the foundation down he started the work amen okay now when Abram was 99 years old the Lord appeared unto him and he said I am almighty God God wasn't shy he went right to Abram he said I'm almighty God now ABR didn't have a reference point Abraham was the is called the father of our faith the originator of our faith point zero God didn't really have a relationship with anybody before Abram Noah found Grace in his eyes Noah Enoch pleased him so much that he walked away with him but other than that there's no relationship God is not really shown as a a God who will have a personal relationship with somebody but he goes to Abraham say I am almighty God Amen walk with me I'll make a Covenant between thee between me and thee leave your family leave your paren leave your identification leave who you're associated with let's make a different Association now you have your fathers you have your forefathers I'm going to show you a different path you're going to be the father of many nations you're going to be the forefather me and you let's get together now let's make a p amen I will multiply the exceedingly and Abraham 99 years old he had already left his Kindred God had already spoken to him and now God's approaching him again you can say God's about to confirm his pact with Abraham maybe Abraham thought it was already completed maybe is was already born and he thought it's all it's it's done God's good so at 99 years old Abraham's probably getting ready to to die now he's going home in peace God comes to him and says okay Abraham let's make this deal Abraham Falls before his [Music] face and here we are in Genesis 17 verse 4 and God speaking to Abraham says as for me behold my Covenant is with thee and thou shalt be a father of many nations neither shall thy name anymore be called Abraham but thy name shall be Abraham for a father of many nations have I made thee many nations I want you to notice that God made Abraham the father of many nations you got people all over the world oh yeah Father Abraham oh yeah my father Abraham we're we're fathers of Abraham and they're all at war with each other amen they're all trying to kill each other off but the angel told Abraham the seed of your woman of your of Sarah the seed of the woman the free woman shall not inherit with the seed of the bonds woman everywhere I go sometimes it seems everybody's telling me your dad's my pastor your dad's my pastor all right your dad's my father but they don't do the things that he did I got to I used to wonder how is it that they say he's their spiritual father and they don't do the things he did amen when I begin to read the scripture I begin to see no wonder I can't go against them can it's impossible seed doesn't persecute seed but yet they will persecute me because they can't help it they don't have the same mother that I have amen you'll be a father of many nations now this is a great promise that God gave Abraham to your children to your children's children as long as you go down the line I will bless you and multiply you the angel of the Lord appeared to the Egyptian and told her go back s Sarah I'm going to bless your son he gave her water out of the Rock bless the son in her womb it's a blessed Nation they're rich God has given them riches but they don't have an inheritance with Israel it's different amen man God Appears to Isaac in chapter 26 of Genesis and he walks up to Isaac the Lord does he walks up to Isaac and he tells Isaac Isaac who are you so no I think that would be us that would be us I think I think if God came up to you and talk to you most of you would say you dude wow he said wow Isaac is he says oh yeah who are you so I am the god of Abraham AB amen I am the god of Abraham see now God had a reference point of contact you might not know me but you know Abraham I'm Abraham's God Amen yes fear not I am with you there's Jacob excuse me U Isaac there's there's Isaac and God is now letting Isaac know that the promise that was given to his father is now going to be transferred over to Isaac amen not to ish not to lot's children to Isaac and he says Isaac I'm the god of Abraham thy father you know I was forgive me baby but we were we were at the Mexican counil and I think it was my brother he asked the question he said why in the world do the Mexican people have it backwards what do you mean on his birth certificate it's gonna say Joseph Garcia Castillo jcia why they have the dad first very easy it's from a Spanish culture the spers were conquerors and they when they went in conquered they put their seed into the land and everybody would know well that's his dad that's why it's the name and the dad's dad but how do you know who the mom is oh that's how you separate my mom is Bernie Garcia from Castillo she's from Caso that's my name well it sounded kind of bad when I was saying it but that's the way it is that's the part of our culture our history who it matters who not only who your daddy was it matters who your mom was is and Isaac had the same daddy oh Abraham's my daddy oh Abraham's my daddy yeah but who's your mama is she the free woman or is she the bonds woman CLA amen he says I am the god of Abraham thy father fear not for I am with you and I will multiply you and thy seed because you're just a good guy no no that what it says says for my servant Abraham's now I I don't know about you but I was present I was present when I heard my pastor say I claim every grandchild of mine as ministers to the Gospel of Jesus Christ wow wow now you might not like how they live you might not like their testimony but let me tell you something one day whenever that day is in God's Great economy that promise shall be fulfilled at least at least that's the confidence I have in my pastor now you might not have that kind of confidence in him I don't have any other choice not for their sake not for my sake but for my servant excuse me for saying it that way I'm gonna bless you Isaac I'm gonna multiply you Isaac I'm gonna be with you because of my servant Abraham amen now in Genesis 28 Jacob goes out there and God Appears to Jacob the Lord stood before him and he said I am the Lord God of Abraham thy father wait a minute that was his grandpa Abraham thy father and the god of Isaac Isaac was his daddy but here God is showing the promise was to Abraham and his seed amen he took him back to the promise I am the god of Abraham my father and ISAC amen amen people say God don't have any grandchildren yeah that's right God don't have any grandchildren and I'm not God grandchildren I don't care if you think I'm a grandchild I don't care if you think Jacob was a grandchild when God looked at Jacob he saw that his daddy was Abraham not Isaac I like God's genealogy better than anybody else's I am the god of Abraham thy father and the god of Isaac the land wherein thou liest to the I will give it and to thy seed amen now he had cousins he had uncles he had relatives he had blood brothers half Brothers half cousins but it wasn't given to them it was given to the Seed of Abraham Father Abraham has many sons many sons has Father Abraham I am one of them and so are you glory to the Lamb of God big me and little you there's no big me and you little we're all the same amen Redeemed by the blood of the Lamb made promises for the sacrifice that Jesus gave for us amen and thy seed th seed he's taking it to him he's taking it to him by seed Jacob SE we're not talking about your daddy seed anymore we're not talking about your father's seat anymore I'm coming now to make a pack with you from here on I will no longer be known as a god of Abraham I will no longer be known as the God ofac I'll be known the god of Abraham and Jacob amen amen yes in thee and thy seed all the families of the earth be blessed and 15 and behold I am with thee and will keep thee in all places where thou goest and I will bring thee again I'll bring thee again into this land for I shall not leave thee until I have done that which I have spoken to the amen now it's no longer Abraham now he has his own promise what was he doing fleeing from his father's land fleeing for his life fleeing for his SA a liar a aief that's right a SC and there on the road in an unrepentant State Heavens opened up before him and he saw the stairways to Heaven angels as standing and descending and God standing before it say I am the god of Abraham my father God of Isaac and now the god of the I'm telling you I'm telling you I'm not asking of you anything Abraham Abraham he said walk before me and be perfect before me I will establish my with you but with Jacob he didn't tell him any of that he said I'm going to do these things for you because I love your daddy amen not Isaac Abraham Abraham your father amen now he went out he went through some hard times Jacob went through some hard times but God was with him how you read your Bible you read your Bible you see Jacob was a Shyer he made a deal with his father-in-law I was going to get paid and after they made the deal he did things to make sure that the offspring would come out according to how they had agreed and all The Offspring became his and people oh man Jacob terrible cheero but do you know who told told him how to do it the angel of the Lord the angel of the Lord told him how to cheat wow why cuz he told him Jacob your uncle's trying to teach you but I'm not going to let that happen because I made a covenant with you so here's what you're going to do and Abra and he did what the angel told him and he had the results that he had took all of his uncle's riches became more richer than his uncle that's right he goes out into the desert on his way back home and there he has a personal encounter again with the angel of the Lord and he wrestled with him all night and from that day he walked differently and God gave him a new name no longer are you going to be called Jacob but Israel shall be amen amen amen amen amen okay whatever God says let it be established and whatever man says Let It Be put aside you're no longer Jacob you're Israel amen who was he the patriarch of the family Israel grew up he had had many sons many sons had Israel but they didn't all have the same mom and they didn't all share the same inheritance Joseph was hated among his brothers he was cast out they they told the daddy he died well they they didn't really they didn't really lie I love I kind of like that about these guys they didn't really lie to their D they did they did a burning technique techn [Laughter] Jun I don't really lie I just tell you things in such a way to allow you to draw your own conclusions so I don't have to lie wow so they told his daddy but here's his coat it's covered with blood is it possible it could be your son's coat Beast has devoured my son oh you could be right Daddy should we go look for him just in case they didn't lie to him they pulled the wool over his eye Joseph gets swn into slavery we all know what happened in Egypt right he became Pharaoh's right hand man now now here in Genesis 45 Joseph is going to reveal himself to his brothers the ones that sold him into slavery who threw them down threw him down the tomb it's going to reveal himself to them and Joseph said unto his Brethren come near to me I pray thee verse four MH and they came near M and he said I am Joseph your brother whom you sold into slavery now therefore be not grieved nor angry with yourselves that you sold me hither for God did send me before you to preserve life hallelujah amen for these two years has the famine been in the land and yet there are five more years to come in which there will never be earring nor Harvest and God sent me before you to preserve a posterity in the earth and to save your life by a great Deliverance so now it was not you that sent me away but God and he hath made me a father to Pharaoh amen amen my goodness mhm he didn't assimilate to Pharaoh's culture Pharaoh assimilated into his culture Pharaoh didn't become his daddy he became Pharaoh's Daddy and he's made me a Lord of all of his house throughout all of the land of Egypt and he sends for his daddy I want you to I want you to watch this Joseph stands for his papa bring him over here oh Dad he's not going to want to come tell him I'm alive he's old he's he can't make the journey bring him so he didn't want to come he didn't believe them so what happens God had to come down again and talk to Israel and tell Israel hey hey it's okay I'm going to be with you you can make the journey up to where Joseph is but I want you to notice how how he addresses him Genesis chapter 46 and we're going to close with this verse two and God spake unto Israel in the visions of the night and he said can you read it with me what did he say Jacob Jacob God told Jacob your name shall not be called Israel no more shall not be called Jacob no more it shall be called Israel you are the prince you're the ruler but now he comes to the same man the Bible says he spoke unto to Israel and he said Jacob Jacob here am I he said here am I he knew who was talking to him and he answered he didn't say oh excuse me sir but I'm not Jacob anymore I'm Israel he answered here I am he said I am God the god of thy father fear not to go into Egypt for I will there make thee a great nation and as you go down the line he tells him what he has done with Joseph he calls him Jacob because the leadership has gone from Israel wow wow let us stand yet a little while and the world will see me no more he shall see me PR shall be with you even in you the end of all time lord Jesus as we ask for your mercy today Lord we ask that you will come father and quieten
