the vessel that God has chosen this [Music] morning to speak to us through and as we sing this [Music] song we will be giving the place to brother Ernesto Gunda to share with us what God has placed upon his [Music] heart one of [Music] them there are people almost everywhere whose hearts are all a place with the fire that fell at Pentecost which cleansed and made it clean it is burn now within my heart all glory to his name I'm so glad that I can say I'm one of them one of them one of them I'm so glad that I can say I'm one of them one of them one of them I'm so glad that I can say I'm one of them though these people may not learn it nor both of worldly F they have all receive their Pentecost baptized in Jesus name and are telling now both far and why his power is yet the same and I'm so glad that I can say I'm one of them one of them one of them I'm so glad that I can say I'm one of them one of them one of them them I'm so glad that I can say I'm one of them and they were gathered in the upper all PR in his name they were baptized with the Holy Ghost and power for Servant came now what he did for them that day he'll do for you the same and I'm so glad GL that I can say I'm one

heart from it will start the joy bells ringing and will keep the soul of f is burning now with in my heart all glory to his and I'm so glad I one of them one of them I'm so glad that I can say one of I'm I can of God bless you little things come to my mind I recall brother brandham saying this that the first time you heard that song he was in a car with some other brothers that were singing him you know what happed raise your hand how many you know raise your hand if you heard him say this any others remember what he said remember what he did after that I'll tell you you can research it young people to the young so the older people can relax today okay don't you have to listen to the young people you can go researches brother said that he stop he said stop the car got out of the car and run around the car several [Applause] times Hallelujah and he got in the car and says sing it again so that's how exited he heard got ex how excited he got when he heard now you'll be able to sing the song you sing this [Music] morning maybe after this morning's talk to sing it identify it and identify yourself call the devil a liar and say I'm one of them okay so that's uh that's my desire while I'm greeting you would you open up your scriptures to Exodus 19 the number already behind because comment that I made that's okay okay God knows everything 19 uh we're going to be reading verses 3 four and five then you and six and then you can be seated um so I'm going to be reading from easy reading Bible that's okay to interpret that I'm reading from a special different maybe a little bit different from what it says on the screen but that's my comment you have to interpret that brother um that's just for there's in English so those that because the Spanish people don't know that I'm it's going to make sound a little different okay it's easy readings Kings James starting with verse three says and Moses went up to God and the Lord called him out of the mountain saying thus shall you say to the house of Jacob and tell the children of Israel you have seen what I did to the Egyptians and how I bore you on eagles wings and brought you to my Sal now therefore for if you will obey my voice indeed and keep my Covenant then you shall be a peculiar treasure to me above all the people of for for all the Earth is mine young people follow that word peculiar nowadays it means weird Oddball different it means really the root word of the mean meaning of the word peculiar in the Bible me particular the possession of somebody God's POS possession here and you shall be to me a kingdom of priests notice that a kingdom of priests and in holy nation are the words which you shall speak to the children of Israel Emily father we thank you for the reading of the word you present your people before you Lord me and my interpreter this morning Lord God help us forgive our sins Lord bring peace to us right now Lord Shalom that Prophet spoke about you are Jehovah Shalom come peace come peaceful God in the name of Lord Jesus Christ thankful Lord God that you have allowed our pastor our ministry here to for us to speak this morning the entire Ministry scho group every group in church Lord bless them Father bring them closer to you in the name of Lord Jesus Christ amen amen now you may be seated the next scripture we want to take is found in in Genesis 14 how many saw that part where it says a kingdom of priests now a kingdom has to do with kingship right royalty is that correct so so we're talking about a a kingdom of priests so it's combining the the we would say like the political part of but it's not that's not the right word I want but you know what I'm saying it's a kingship and then the priesthood the religious part everybody see that it's very simple right Kingdom of priests now let's look at verse of 18 19 20 of Genesis 14 and before I read that brother brother Johnny can brother Jonathan can correct me if I in the pronunciation but the king here speaks about is MC and it's a compound word in Hebrew it's is that right Jonathan corre Jonathan and the other part is so we put them together and so m means king anded means righteousness you have the king of righteousness none other but okay we'll see that okay let's 18 19 20 and mesed king of Salem brought forth Bread and Wine and he was the priest of the most high God you see that combination people of a king and a priest you see how beautiful that is and I know that you read the scripture say getting ahead of myself you have made us Kings and Priests isn't that right I'm I'm I'm fulfilling brother Bernie I'm fulfilling a request that you made about 20 years ago not me that he asked is that what I said did I said yes me I'm sorry I apologize um he asked one day I was sitting over here up here in those days and turn like this he says maybe some of these ministers someday can talk about MC I saw nothing in it then when I finally hit me about the uh King being a king and a priest I go it blew my mind it's been about 15 years ago since touched it another places but not here and this is a Sunday school Sunday school lesson and so there's a lot goes along with that but let's read that and mesc I'm and mzed 18 my Bible and MZ king of Salem brought forth Bread and Wine and he was a priest of the most high God we're reading it again that's and he blessed them and said Blessed Be ABR of the most high god possessor of Heaven and Earth and blessed and blessed be the most high God which was Del which has delivered your enemies into your hand and he gave him the tenth of all okay so our next scripture is we're it's we're reading a few scriptures for the young people to follow through on this see if that thing will work is not advancing so I'll ask you to go to the next slides brother because this is not cooperating right now we're probably too far away uh first 1 Peter 29 again read the entire chapter It's A Beautiful chapter all beautiful tonight but but you are a chosen generation a royal priesthood see that again really beautiful when you think about it Ro I don't have to sell this this sells itself but the greatest brother bradam said the greatest drawing card in the world is the Gospel of Jesus Christ when it's preaching the simplicity and I would say like this in Spanish [Music] amen it was a drawing card right drawing C L but you are a chosen priest you are chosen generation a royal priesthood and holy nation A peculiar people that you should show forth the Praises of him to have called you to the dark from out of Darkness Into His Marvelous Light how many in the Tes have you ever heard brother say why you a chosen Nation royal priesthood offering the the Praises of God and the fruit of your lips how many you heard him preaching just like that just a few of you raise your hand if you've heard that yeah just a few of you listen to it and you can check it out on the internet on on the table go ahead brother say that how many heard say that they told you in English praise the Lord John chapter 1 vers 40 41 I'll get to what I wanted to say the scripture in John read one of the two which heard John speak and followed him was Andrew Simon Peter's son brother my brothers and sisters in this finish Tabernacle Pho brother said if you if you don't if you don't test ify of the glory of God you're going to find yourself someday called different what do what do I think Phoenix Tabernacle needs I'm not scolding anybody I'm not taking the place of the pastor go of God going into all the world and preaching goel Serv creature Outreach out Outreach Outreach we're worried about our little differences here little no it's got a comma here got a period here forget about that Outreach starting with our backing young people I wasn't going to say that cuz I'm limited on time and I'll be asking the Min the the musicians to come forward in a little bit what is the first thing that Andrew does he finds a messiah he's worried about his brother goes and seeks for his brother starts looking out for his brother put yourself in the situation you you've been promised a messiah all your life then all of a sudden so to speak something descends in your heart everything you've been preached talked about the Messiah Isaiah 7:14 isah 96 something inside you just kind of speaks and says this scripture is fulfilled what about Mary a day or two or three or four days later they're reading she and Joseph are reading 714 of Isaiah a virgin shall conceive and then Gabriel comes to her and tells her so to speak Mary do you remember 714 yes a virgin shall conceive this day this scripture fulfilled it's you you're that virgin that's how you feel one of them one of them you really sing it from your lips or or from your heart which one are you one of them I got to finish the scripture I'm sorry and his first he first finds his own brother Simon and says to him we found the Messiah which is being interpreted the Christ and then we go to John chapter 4 you very well know this know the scripture very very well far pardon my my my 424 5 and six I like 4 25 because it's my birthday God is Spirit that's 24 and they that worship go him as worship Him in spirit and in truth the woman says to him I know that Messiah comes which is called Christ when he is come he will tell us all things I'm going to rephrase this the way it says here I'm going to read a little bit differently I am he that speaks to you The Great I Am was speaking to her I that speak to you am he okay so now we can get a little bit started into the message God willing my subject uh this morning is uh well there's the title there I guess I don't I can't see what's on top is here's the title and the meanings the word itself Messiah um the anointed one and in the Old Testament it was not just used M was not used only for the messiah messiah it was used for anybody that was anointed anointed it could be the anointed king see in strong concordance Mia something like that means number number 48 9 young people those of you that are in the message young people make that a link B talking about make it strong cor a bookmark know how big I am in anology right people young people how many young people know that very big maybe maybe some of them are at the park getting ready for the but that's okay that's her job but how many of you know that I'm big on enology learned that from my dad and from Brother Paul brother Paul directed me to the dictionary but many people call the T right something like that and in the dictionary the dictionary Collegiate dictionary SS brother young man it'll always give you the atmology first that beautiful anyway I was going to say something ree that spirit in strong conord that 4899 it means anointed or anointed one can be used for the Messiah or the Messianic PRI can be used for the king of Israel can be used for the high priest of is Israel now here's my title for this morning is mesas okay M little Messiah raise your hand any of you guys have heard of the of the soccer player name last name Messi raise your hand don't be don't be ashamed how many know of Jesus the Messiah half of the church that's good the other half of the church knows about Messi Messiah Mah Messi Messias today we'll use the word in in Spanish Messi Messias Messias okay all right now my thoughts are King Kings priest priests anointed one anointed ones now I want you to notice one thing kings were anointed yes or no David was anointed three times I'm way off I'm way off of here apologize apologize to myself God I apologize I'm sorry but there's something I gotta I got I'm I'm fighting something right now I got to hit it I got to hit it hard I can't I can't tell you what it is if I could I would just read to you but here's what brother bam said I was sitting over there and brother Bernie preached believing God eight months she can raise her hand if she wants to she doesn't have to raise eight months of depression taking kind tranquilizers say that again eight months eight months taking tranquilizers and brother Bernie has a prayer line in line been eight months since I've been back from

testimony right now I came forward stood right about right there brother I brother B standing about right here and he goes like this I said to him I feel like something's wrong spir with me spiritually would you pray for me brother B he starts praying for me and the moment he started praying for me there was like a sheet or something just like a something a power energy come going in all directions down I go wow what is that and then he says Lord and he says pray for me and he's praying for me and he says Lord come down on Ernie like El and he says there it is Ernie you feel it I knew we were in contact with the same spirit because when it hit his hand I I went over there and little the little benches we have I went over there cried like a baby fountain exped you tell me two three days ago talking about this crazy I'm going to talk about this I'm stay on this stay focused on this that's that's what I spent several weeks days and hours just condensing condensing condensing an

his by his office standing like this coming around the corner and he goes like this and he says Ernie it's not that there's something wrong with and I'm not saying I'm not bragging please understand

and anybody that's anointed is an anointed one how remember that scripture oh how beautiful it is to dwell in unity it's an oil that pours down how many that's how they would anoint him they Anointed with oil and I I I know Kings were anointed prests were anointed but I searched back and forth and I could find only one Prophet that was anointed we know there all Anointed with the Holy Ghost only one find in the scripture Prophet was anointed you know who that is yall out if you know who it is Elisha is elas Elijah El the Elijah of our day is the Lord Jesus Christ who is the Elisha who did Brother said was Elisha it's the bride so there is the Lord Jesus Christ with a big old thing of anointing canister of oil pouring it on elah everything that God was pouring to Christ Christ was church is that beautiful so that Ernie Bara could get the preeminence that right so that he the prence Jesus Christ the anointed one the Lord Jesus Messiah the Lord Jesus the Lord Jesus Holy Ghost I don't see how you can separate him from the deity I got to get my title over Messiah means the anointed one the the the anointed king the it can also mean Christ now this morning our first use of Messiah deals with the thought of the anointed king we're going to be looking at some of the things brother brandham said about the anointed the Kings and the anointed Kings forward two slides brother okay I think that's right right there now the first one we want to consider young people listen to it this message at least 20 30 times what I'm going to suggest to you right now again I'm off task it's called the five definite identifications of the True Church of the Living God it's one of the four books now you got to help me here those of you that know this how many of you here 2001 or 200 I think it's 2102 and I think the the the the letter was typed out December 26th 2001 I think or something like that it starts off like this if you remember very somber note it says this is the day after Christmas anybody remember that nobody remembers that letter so I'm writing this to my friends remember brother do you remember that that letter brother Charlie if we have it I think we need to print it out for the church to read and in that letter he says a lot of things Shak shaking things one of the things he says so I'm going to be he says in the missionary field so I'm going to be only working with four books why did why did he go why was the shepher did he go to sheer why was a Shepherd um taking side with Jesus messano Messianic Empire and five definite five definite identification of the true church of living God so five definite identifications of the True Church of the Living God if you're if you're a follower of brother brother Bernie's Ministry wouldn't you like to know what what those four books contain and and so one of those that two of them are in English take a side with Jesus yes yeah okay and um that's that he he was referring to um um brother bram's book of course Jesus brother's booko is the only one of those four that was his preaching and I told him I wouldn't get into this but I in in the in impediment in in the message the five definite identifications I'll just say like that this is what I'm going be reading from right now okay this is first quote now in the Old Testament the known church was called the kingdom of God God's kingdom now I'm taking this from the chronology of the Bible the Old Testament the church was called the kingdom of God in other words God is a king and the church is his domain God's kingdom Old Testament part two in the New Testament it's called the Messianic Empire oh I like that Messianic in other in other wise the messiah's Empire where the Empire rules and Reigns no denominational barriers or nothing the Messiah rules in his Empire isn't that wonderful thinking Empire now young people check out that word empire heard of the Roman Empire during the Roman Empire during around the time within 100 or 200 years of Jesus time actually he was killed in 45 or 49 BC then Octavius takes over but is Caesar Augustus they were Emperors right yes or no was there not a king in in Jerusalem in Israel so he was a king over Kings so to make it real simple see even I can understand it what is an emperor a King of Kings King over Kings teachers how many you know that that's that's the way it's taught in school that's it's okay that's how it's King over a king is an Empire an emperor so an emperor is a king over Kings we have Messianic Empire the King of Kings therefore the church is not an organization the church is not a gathering of people the church is the people of God that's been called out of the world to serve in another kingdom part three here all through the scriptures all the prophets speak of that coming one the anointed king he has to be a king who was to lead Israel to freedom from All Nations and make them rulers over Nations let's do a sound check right now am I a little bit too loud for you ra your hand just how many think I'm a little bit too loud right now my voice lower little okay thank you number four Jesus of Nazareth filled every description that all the prophets spoke of to be the Messiah this for word from Brother Bram let's skip bit he still is King he's a king now Revelations 153 says he's king of saints quoting him he says th king of saints okay now his signs this is Jesus is now his signs of Messiah Pro him that's number five right there his signs of Messiah proved him to be the Messiah proved him to be the anointed one upon Sunday we read the scripture Rejoice greatly oh Daughter of Zion what did Brother tell us of Zion was shout it out the bride so it's telling you right there let's read it let's reread it rejoice oh Bri shout that old daughter of Jerusalem thy King your wow cometh unto you just and having salvation proud and arrogant riding on a big charger I'm sorry is that what it in Spanish that's not what it says I just heard you say that no no okay lonely and riding on upon an ass and upon the cold cold the fold of an ass oh I'm just a donkey I'm just a donkey so you Somey some what's going on look what are you taking my donkey the master has need of him Hallelujah there's BM I'm I'm going to get a 401k 401K guys promised me a room full of gold then the angel SS in front of him to kill him he's blind all he sees is dollar signs the stops he even talks to him speaks in tongues right I always have this question i' I've had this question in my mind and I'll ask if I'm there if if I don't then I'll ask the other guy is it possible or is it that dried up Jawbone of a donkey dried up is it possible that that jaw was already anointed because it had already spoken tongues back there to Bam spoke human language to him I've always been your donkey why why you kicking me that's why you're kicking me what's wrong with you buddy that's another sign that Prov the Messiah was just as the Messianic uh Ministry that he had after he after he discerns Nathaniel Nathaniel said Rabbi you are the Son of God you are the king of Israel now let's notice how something here I think there's another slide after this brother but the kingdom of God is established in the heart and soul of a man by a revelation of Jesus Christ Messiah are anointed ones m m God made us Kings and Priests Jesus is the light of the world and he said we are the light of the world stripping over all these readings that I had Messiah are anointed to two we are Messi we've been sent to all the world to preach the gospel to
