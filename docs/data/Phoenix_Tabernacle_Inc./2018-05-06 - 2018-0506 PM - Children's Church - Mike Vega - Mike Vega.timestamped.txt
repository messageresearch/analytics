[17:06] Oh
[17:13] [Music]
[17:17] god bless you once again it has befallen
[17:22] me my privilege to be able to bring you
[17:24] the next in a series of sequential
[17:27] excerpts from the series supernatural to
[17:30] life of William Branham we're at book
[17:32] three the man in his commissioned 1946
[17:35] to 1950 written by a precious brother
[17:38] orange or Genson tonight we're going to
[17:40] continue the chapter our prayer line
[17:42] eight days long from 1946 just a few
[17:46] comments before we get started I'm so
[17:50] thankful to the Lord that we have a
[17:51] prophet that gave his all out there in
[17:55] the field for the Lord Jesus Christ his
[18:00] ministry went national in 1946 and
[18:03] encompass over eighteen and a half years
[18:05] and I think everyone knows here when
[18:09] brother Brennan spoke of the Lord his
[18:13] heart was always in it there was never a
[18:16] moment that I heard a service that
[18:18] brother Brennan was involved in that I
[18:21] ever had to question the authenticity of
[18:23] what he was sharing with us we knew it
[18:25] came straight from the Lord and tonight
[18:27] we're going to get a taste of how he
[18:31] gave his all to such a degree that he he
[18:34] pushed his own physical limitations to
[18:36] the point that I'm thankful that the
[18:39] Lord impressed upon the the brothers who
[18:42] worked with him to look after him and so
[18:46] he had just finished praying for a young
[18:49] girl named Morgan who was in the
[18:52] hospital and that's where we left off
[18:54] and in that particular scene it were so
[18:57] thankful that the Lord healed her three
[18:59] days after his prayer and she was able
[19:02] to return to school so now we're in the
[19:04] fall of 46 there came a time later that
[19:08] fall of 1946 when Bill realized he could
[19:10] not sustain such a constant effort
[19:12] indefinitely
[19:13] he decided that after the eight nights
[19:16] scheduled for Jonesboro Arkansas he
[19:18] would take some time off
[19:19] Reverend Reed sponsored the Jonesboro
[19:21] campaign organizing an
[19:23] of local churches to cooperate together
[19:26] they rented the largest auditorium in
[19:27] the city still there was not nearly
[19:30] enough room to seat all the people who
[19:31] came thousands upon thousands drove in
[19:34] from all over the South and Midwest for
[19:37] 50 miles around Jonesboro not one empty
[19:40] hotel or motel room could be found those
[19:43] who could not find other lodging slept
[19:45] in tents or under trucks or in their
[19:47] cars an estimate by the local newspaper
[19:49] pegged the crowd at 28,000 strong when a
[19:52] meeting started many thousands were left
[19:54] standing outside auditorium hoping for a
[19:57] chance to get inside they all began the
[19:59] first service in Jonesboro with his
[20:01] usual down-home greeting if ever you're
[20:04] you're in need just call me and if I
[20:06] possibly can I'll come to you rain or
[20:08] shine or if you're near Jeffersonville
[20:10] Indiana stop by and see me I live near
[20:13] my church on a street and Penn Street I
[20:16] love you and I'll do anything I can to
[20:18] help you then bill made a brave
[20:20] declaration because this will be my last
[20:23] week in Arkansas for a while I intend to
[20:25] stay right here at the pulpit until
[20:27] every last sick person has come through
[20:29] the prayer line about this time bill
[20:32] noticed a woman sitting near the front
[20:34] waving at him energetically is there
[20:36] something I can do for your sister he
[20:38] asked don't you recognize me she said
[20:40] with a big grin on her face no I don't
[20:43] believe I do the last time you saw me
[20:46] was in Little Rock they tell me that my
[20:48] legs were all bloody and I was out of my
[20:49] head now bill did recognise her it was
[20:53] the woman he had prayed for in the
[20:54] basement of the Little Rock Civic
[20:56] Auditorium just a few months ago she was
[20:58] so insane that she had kicked the glass
[21:00] out of the back seat of a car and had
[21:02] crawled across the basement floor on her
[21:04] back now she sat calmly with her husband
[21:07] and their four children seated beside
[21:09] them her husband testified after you
[21:12] prayed for her that night she sat
[21:13] quietly in the car all the way back to
[21:16] the institution within three days they
[21:18] declared her completely well and let her
[21:20] come home starting the service was such
[21:23] a dramatic testament he calls the faith
[21:25] of the audience to soar into heavenly
[21:27] expectations they watched as a sign in
[21:31] bills hands supernaturally revealed
[21:32] diseases and they marveled when they saw
[21:35] how Bill's quiet prayer chain
[21:37] situation soon nothing seemed impossible
[21:40] forming a line to Bill's right the
[21:42] people streamed forward for prayer like
[21:44] a river that never ran dry
[21:46] hour after hour they came as soon as one
[21:49] person that received prayer and sat down
[21:51] someone else got out of a seat and
[21:53] joined the end of the line the crowd
[21:56] gained the inescapable feeling that
[21:59] Jesus Christ stood near this small man
[22:02] on the platform and everyone wanted a
[22:04] turn in Christ's presence demeaning
[22:06] simply did not in bill prayed all night
[22:09] for the sick pausing occasionally to
[22:11] have a drink of orange juice sometime in
[22:13] the wee hours of the morning he lay down
[22:15] beside the pulpit in that poor few hours
[22:17] when he woke up the organist was still
[22:19] playing softly only believe only believe
[22:23] all things are possible only believe and
[22:26] the prayer line was still in place with
[22:28] the next patient waiting her turn for
[22:30] prayer bill took his meals beside the
[22:33] pulpit so he could continue to pray for
[22:36] the sick throughout the day those who
[22:38] were lucky enough to have gotten inside
[22:39] the auditorium on the first day were now
[22:41] reluctant to leave many of them kept
[22:43] their seats day after day sending
[22:45] someone out to bring back sandwiches
[22:47] when they got hungry they also
[22:49] telephoned friends and relations to tell
[22:51] them about the fantastic move of God
[22:53] they were watching and to urge them to
[22:55] come see the miracles for themselves
[22:57] this calls more people to come to
[22:59] Jonesboro throughout the week those
[23:01] outside the auditorium waited patiently
[23:03] in a long confused line by the front
[23:05] door hoping for a chance to enter slowly
[23:08] very very slowly the line inch forward
[23:11] as people inside the auditorium trickled
[23:13] out allowing a few more people on the
[23:15] outside to trickle in when people came
[23:18] out they would describe the amazing
[23:20] miracles that were happening inside few
[23:22] of the people in the line outside the
[23:24] building ever left the area even when
[23:26] during the middle of the week it began
[23:28] to rain night and day bill prayed for an
[23:31] unending line of sick and afflicted the
[23:33] miracles flows just as inexhaustibly
[23:36] one morning about four o'clock a 35 year
[23:39] old woman came up before bill in the
[23:41] prayer line holding a handkerchief over
[23:43] her nose with her left hand bill assumed
[23:46] she was weeping when she held her right
[23:48] hand with his left
[23:50] vibrations revealed her disease he said
[23:52] you've got cancer have a new lady the
[23:55] woman took her left hand away from her
[23:57] face she had no nose at all the cancer
[24:00] had already devoured it
[24:01] do you believe ask bill her voice
[24:05] trembled with desperation brother
[24:07] Brennan I've got to believe it's my only
[24:09] hope
[24:10] then sister I can help you because the
[24:13] angel that's it that that met me said if
[24:17] I would be sincere and if I could get
[24:20] the people to believe me then nothing
[24:22] would stand before my prayer not even
[24:23] cancer as bill prayed in the name of
[24:26] Jesus Christ he let himself feel for the
[24:29] desperate plight of this doomed young
[24:31] woman soon the ferocious throbbing in
[24:33] his arm disappeared in he knew she was
[24:35] healed on the eighth and final evening
[24:38] of the jonesboro campaign bill
[24:40] interrupted the constant prayer line
[24:42] long enough to go down to the train
[24:44] station and meet his wife they had not
[24:46] seen each other for months she had come
[24:48] to be with him for the last evening
[24:50] service of the jonesboro campaign and
[24:52] then she would accompany him back to
[24:54] Jeffersonville for his much-needed rest
[24:56] when they drove to the auditorium they
[24:59] had to stop and park many blocks away
[25:00] from their destination the streets and
[25:03] parking lots were crammed with cars
[25:04] trucks bicycles in tents bill and maida
[25:08] walked toward the auditorium finally
[25:10] made us saw the huge crowd waiting
[25:12] outside the building many holding
[25:13] newspapers over their heads to shield
[25:15] themselves from the drizzle even though
[25:18] bill had described this to her on the
[25:20] phone she was not prepared for the
[25:22] reality Billy that all these people come

[56:36] can you come up and read it for me
[56:38] Bernie it's just five one into if it's
[56:41] your single only dose be he therefore
[56:48] followers of God as dear children and
[56:52] walk in love as Christ hath loved us and
[56:56] hath given himself for us an offering
[56:59] and a sacrifice to God for a
[57:03] sweet-smelling savour said way Samhita
[57:07] Dora's adios como hijos a mouse and ah
[57:09] de Namur come Tammy increase oh no Sam
[57:11] oh yes entrega assamese manipuri
[57:13] nosotros o friend a sacrificios of us in
[57:16] O Lord frag aunty
[57:18] alright alright so so the scripture here
[57:21] IC k let's do that and in the first part
[57:24] it's telling us to therefore be
[57:26] imitators of who in a preeminent part
[57:29] and OCC said play scimitar is a king of
[57:32] Christ right they crossed over that
[57:34] ideals right can I ask Chris Chris do
[57:37] you mind if I ask you with the word
[57:38] imitators means you know pregunta Chris
[57:40] de lo que significa la palabra Amita
[57:42] Laura so the word imitator I would say
[57:45] to mimic or copy the behavior of someone
[57:49] else a CQ nematode or yo diría que
[57:52] scimitar a salami Michael a copy of a
[57:54] album otra persona what do you think
[57:56] what do you think Hannah keepin zahana
[57:58] pretty pretty pretty right on that
[58:00] Phoebe you think that's right about
[58:01] there yeah what do you think brother
[58:03] there any imitators que piensa copy yeah
[58:08] hope yeah alright so so it's saying it's
[58:11] saying therefore to be imitators of God
[58:14] as dear children
[58:15] this has said Wes emitted or residues
[58:17] como eCos amazos and then and then it
[58:19] tells us a little bit further it says
[58:21] and walk in love a muscle Atlanta DC and
[58:25] add in a more as Christ also hath loved
[58:31] us come on time increased so no some
[58:33] more so so he's saying the Scriptures
[58:38] China's here through the apostille
[58:40] cyclist veteranos de otra vez el

[58:45] tenemos que Amita and that we have to
[58:47] walk in love it contain a musky and dad

[59:11] illustration the malleable Moses are
[59:12] comin our demostración

[59:15] pero él lo que siempre mi oficina vu is
[59:17] when you think about our Lord Jesus
[59:19] Christ is con usted piensa they're not
[59:21] singular so Chris can you think about
[59:23] the life that was flowing through him
[59:25] instead piensa cerca de la vida que flu

[59:29] that life you've said in Pisa Mira ice a
[59:32] vida and you began to look at how he
