[25:30] here that's here tonight once again it's
[25:33] a privilege and an honor to be standing
[25:35] here approach I don't feel worthy of but
[25:39] we have to keep pressing on the battle
[25:43] and we have a prophet his name is
[25:47] William Mary and Branham his life was
[25:52] supernatural
[25:53] tonight we're gonna find out how things
[25:56] changed we've arrived at book three
[26:00] entitled supernatural - life of William
[26:02] Branham the man in his commission 1946
[26:05] to 1950 written by Owen Jorgensen what a
[26:08] tremendous work we're starting chapter
[26:11] 35 the titled the chapters refusing a
[26:15] check for 1 million five hundred
[26:17] thousand dollars now I know that's a lot
[26:21] of money and it would be a lot of money
[26:24] to anyone I would that I know if you're
[26:29] curious converting that to the value of
[26:32] dollars in 2018 using very basic
[26:37] calculation of three and a half percent
[26:38] inflation per year brother Ernie I know
[26:41] you know about that math it comes out to
[26:43] just under seventeen point two million
[26:44] dollars today having said that we have a
[26:49] profit that operated not in the world
[26:53] me although he was subject to it he
[26:55] operated in God's economy and we're so
[26:58] thankful for that
[26:59] the moment in the chapter that the title
[27:02] refers to happens in part 2 of the
[27:03] chapter tonight we're doing part 1 and
[27:06] so let's get started now that William
[27:10] Branham had returned home to
[27:11] Jeffersonville he discovered he had
[27:12] acquired a new set of responsibilities
[27:15] letters funneled in from all over the
[27:17] United States in Canada at first bill
[27:19] and made us struggled to answer this
[27:21] mail by themselves every day the mailman
[27:24] dropped another giant bag full of
[27:25] letters on the porch and soon bill
[27:27] realized this job was too much for him
[27:30] he rented a small office and hired mr.
[27:32] and mrs. Cox
[27:34] members of his congregation as
[27:35] secretaries with their help bill
[27:38] separated the mail into two piles the
[27:40] first and the largest group of letters
[27:42] came from people describing their
[27:44] troubles and needs and asking him to
[27:46] pray for them bill considered these
[27:48] requests as just another part of his
[27:50] Commission and he prayed earnestly over
[27:52] each one the second pile of letters came
[27:55] from the minister's inviting him to come
[27:56] and hold healing campaigns in their
[27:58] localities Bill's set these invitations
[28:02] aside and prayed about where God wanted
[28:04] him to go next
[28:05] eventually he arranged night in ireri
[28:07] that would keep him busy through the
[28:09] middle of 1947 first while the northern
[28:12] states were snow bound he would travel
[28:14] in the south beginning in Louisiana and
[28:16] moving westward to Texas Arizona in
[28:19] California later in the spring he would
[28:21] spend several months near to home before
[28:24] heading north into Saskatchewan in
[28:26] Alberta Canada although not fully
[28:29] recovered from his exhaustion bill felt
[28:31] impatient to get back to the work for
[28:33] which the Lord had called him for he
[28:36] began in Shreveport Louisiana where he
[28:39] was scheduled to hold five services for
[28:41] Reverend Jack Moore pastor of an
[28:43] independent Pentecostal Church known as
[28:44] Life tabernacle when Reverend Moore took
[28:47] Bill over to his church for the first
[28:49] service Moore was astonished to find his
[28:52] large tabernacle so crowded with
[28:54] strangers that he and his guests had
[28:56] difficulty getting inside mere
[28:59] word-of-mouth advertising had drawn
[29:01] families from all over Louisiana and
[29:03] Arkansas
[29:04] more decided they needed more room so
[29:06] for the second night here in into High
[29:08] School Auditorium however after only two
[29:11] services in this auditorium he decided
[29:13] to move his meetings back to life
[29:14] Tabernacle because the people were
[29:16] showing up so early at the high school
[29:18] that they were disrupting the school day
[29:19] this was a week like Jack Moore had
[29:23] never seen before
[29:24] five nights filled with milk miracles
[29:26] and wonders later he would write about
[29:29] it saying the people were left humbled
[29:31] and tendered because they knew that
[29:33] Jesus of Nazareth had passed our way in
[29:35] his servant yes Bible days were here
[29:39] again here was a man who practiced what
[29:42] we preached I say this not to exalt any
[29:46] human but only to emphasize that our
[29:48] deep appreciation for our brother
[29:50] William Branham stem from the fact that
[29:52] his ministry seemed to bring our lover
[29:54] Lord Jesus closer to us and to better
[29:58] acquaint us with his living works his
[30:00] personality and his deity than anything
[30:03] had before feeling he had to know more
[30:07] about this phenomenal ministry Jack
[30:09] Moore left his church in the hands of an
[30:11] associate pastor so that he could travel
[30:13] with William Branham through the rest of
[30:15] the year
[30:16] after Louisiana bill flew the Texas
[30:18] holding meetings in Houston for 15
[30:20] straight nights before moving on to
[30:22] Texarkana in San Antonio during his
[30:25] first night in San Antonio something
[30:28] happened that shook bill to the heart of
[30:30] his spirit the service began the song
[30:33] leader announced bill to the audience
[30:35] the crowd waited reverently and with
[30:37] expectation as bill walked across the
[30:39] platform toward the pulpit a man sitting
[30:42] on the platform stood and spoke in an
[30:44] unknown language the unintelligible
[30:46] words firing loud and rapidly like a
[30:48] machine gun when he finished the
[30:51] audience remained quiet
[30:52] another man stood in the back of the
[30:54] auditorium and bellowed thus saith the
[30:56] Lord the man that is walking across the
[30:59] platform is going forward with the
[31:01] ministry that was ordained by Almighty
[31:03] God as john the baptist was sent to
[31:06] forerun the first coming of jesus christ
[31:08] so is this man sent to forerun his
[31:11] second coming
[31:13] the old felt lightheaded and weak enough
[31:16] to have his knees buckle he grabbed the
[31:18] pulpit to support himself has he spoken
[31:20] to the microphone sir you and the back
[31:22] who just gave a prophesy do you know
[31:25] this man here on the platform who spoke
[31:27] in tongues demands standing in the back
[31:29] look like a cowboy no sir I do not do
[31:32] you know anything about me
[31:34] I've never heard of you before today how
[31:37] did you come to be here tonight the
[31:39] people I work for were coming to the
[31:41] meetings and they asked me to come along
[31:42] so I came
[31:44] turning to the man behind him on the
[31:47] platform who had spoken with tongues
[31:48] bill asked do you know that man who gave
[31:51] the prophecy no I don't what are you
[31:55] doing here tonight I'm a local merchant
[31:57] I read in the paper about a divine
[31:59] healer so I came to see what it was all
[32:02] about having studying first Corinthians
[32:06] 12 through 14 bill knew that the
[32:08] interpretation of tongues was listed as
[32:10] a gift of the Holy Spirit
[32:12] however bill had long suspected that
[32:14] much of what the Pentecostal people
[32:16] called tongues was nothing more than
[32:18] excitement fanaticism and carnality this
[32:21] interpretation did not fit into any of
[32:23] those three categories this one sounded
[32:26] genuine because this stranger had
[32:28] repeated what Bill had heard that day in
[32:30] 1933 when he had stood baptizing in the
[32:33] Ohio River and that star had appeared
[32:34] overhead that was 14 years ago at this
[32:38] time bill marvel wondering if there
[32:41] would be more to his ministry than just
[32:42] praying for the sick after Texas bill
[32:46] traveled to Phoenix Arizona stress
[32:49] continued to tear him down it felt like
[32:51] more than just long hours of standing in
[32:53] too little sleep when bill prayed for
[32:55] the sick he actually felt that demonic
[32:57] forces he battled it tired him as much
[32:59] as digging a ditch in rocky ground with
[33:01] a shovel and pick whenever bill took a
[33:04] patient's right hand in his left and
[33:05] allowed the disease to vibrate up his
[33:07] arm to his heart he felt some of his own
[33:10] energy crumble away energy that did not
[33:12] come back after a night's sleep he
[33:14] learned about demons by matching what he
[33:17] read in the Bible with what he
[33:18] experienced while praying for the sick
[33:19] he read in the New Testament how demons
[33:22] cast out of one person look for another
[33:24] host
[33:24] he watched the same phenomenon in his
[33:27] meetings as a patient on the platform
[33:29] was deliver from insanity it was
[33:31] possible down an irreverent unbeliever
[33:32] in the audience could receive the same
[33:34] disease he remembered a group of people
[33:37] who were disrespectful in jonesboro
[33:38] jeering and making cat calls at a time
[33:41] when bill was praying for a man
[33:42] thrashing on the floor with an epileptic
[33:44] seizure epileptic people who came near
[33:47] the angel of the Lord always had
[33:48] seizures after bill prayed the young man
[33:51] returned to normal but that whole group
[33:53] of irreverence skeptics fell into
[33:55] epileptic fits later he learned it was a
[33:58] minister and 28 people from his
[34:00] congregation who contracted the epilepsy
[34:02] that night from that experience bill
[34:04] learned caution now whenever he sense a
[34:07] stubborn case he asked the audience to
[34:09] bow their heads and pray with him he
[34:11] learned that even unbelievers would be
[34:12] safe in his meetings if they acted
[34:14] respectfully one night in Phoenix a
[34:16] child came through the prayer line bill
[34:18] took the girl's hand and felt the
[34:20] tell-tale vibrations of epilepsy the
[34:22] child jerked into a seizure falling to
[34:24] the platform and thrashing
[34:25] uncontrollably the audience gasped bill
[34:28] remain calm and ask everyone to bow
[34:30] their heads when he bowed his own head
[34:33] to pray he sensed a break in the flow of
[34:35] faith looking again over the crowd he
[34:37] spotted a man who had not lowered his
[34:39] head bill sent into the microphone there
[34:42] is a man to my right with his head up
[34:43] sir even if you don't believe please bow
[34:46] your head and be reverent these demon
[34:48] powers can go from one to another the
[34:51] man did not bow his head one of the
[34:53] ushers walked over and talked to him
[34:55] then came up onto the platform and told
[34:57] bill
[34:57] it's mr. kay one of Phoenix's public
[35:00] officials he says there isn't anything
[35:02] to this stuff but a good case of
[35:03] psychology he insists he doesn't have to
[35:06] put his head down bill spoke again into
[35:08] the microphone sir I asked you that's
[35:10] all I can do he turned back to the child
[35:13] who ribs on the floor making low
[35:15] guttural noises bill prayed God don't
[35:19] let this innocent child suffer because
[35:21] of that man's unbelief press blessed the
[35:24] child and deliver her the girl calmed
[35:26] and soon opened her eyes her guardian
[35:28] rushed forward to help her up and
[35:30] together they walked off the platform
[35:31] praising God
[35:34] mr. K smiled defiantly as though he had
[35:37] proved his point he did not have to bow
[35:40] his head unfortunately it would be a
[35:42] short-lived victory on bills last night
[35:45] in Phoenix he promised the crowd that he
[35:47] would try to pray for everyone in the
[35:48] building who wanted prayer that would
[35:50] have been impossible to do if he had to
[35:52] take hold of every person's hand so that
[35:54] the vibrations could reveal each disease
[35:56] tonight he tried something different he
[35:58] called it a fast prayer line people on
[36:01] the prayer line kept moving at a slow
[36:02] steady pace while bill just laid his
[36:04] hand on their shoulders as they passed
[36:06] asking the Lord Jesus to heal them many
[36:09] miracles happened that night although
[36:11] perhaps the most amazing is the one that
[36:13] happened to had a Waldorf a woman dying
[36:15] from cancer of the heart liver and colon
[36:17] her doctors had given up on her now she
[36:19] was trying desperately to reach this man
[36:22] who claimed an angel stood next to him
[36:24] when he prayed for the sick Haddie's
[36:27] husband in an intern from the hospital
[36:28] carried her into the meeting on a
[36:30] stretcher as they waited in the prayer
[36:32] line she felt her life fading away she
[36:35] told her husband even if I die
[36:37] take me through anyway they were a long
[36:40] way back as the line slowly inched
[36:42] forward she lapsed into unconsciousness
[36:44] soon her chest
[36:46] quit moving the intern felt had poor had
[36:48] his pulse and could not detect it so he
[36:51] pulled the blanket over her face mr.
[36:53] Waldorf with grim determination kept our
[36:56] place in line it took an hour for mr.
[36:59] worf to get his wife to the front of the
[37:01] line someone told bill there was a
[37:03] corpse coming through bill stop the line
[37:07] so he could pray longer for this case
[37:10] the woman felt cold to his touch when
[37:13] Bill asked God to give Hattie water of
[37:15] her life again
[37:16] not only did breath flow back into her
[37:19] lungs but soon she sat up and later that
[37:22] evening she actually walked out of the
[37:24] building on her own strength that long
[37:27] prayer line in Phoenix abounded with
[37:29] healings and miracles even though bill
[37:31] kept his prayer short it still took him
[37:34] until 3 o'clock in the morning to touch
[37:36] all the sick who passed by according to
[37:38] Jack Mohr's estimate on that one night
[37:41] in February of 1947 bill prayed for
[37:44] 2,500 people God bless you
