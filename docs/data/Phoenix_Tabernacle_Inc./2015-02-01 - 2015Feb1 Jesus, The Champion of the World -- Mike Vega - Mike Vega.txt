father we're grateful father for the opportunity that we have Lord to be able to read a little bit of your blessed word Lord a little bit of the message that is brought by our Prophet brother brandham we just ask father that you speak to us this evening may it be a blessing to our hearts father just a short and simple message Lord and may you just give my brothers and sisters that are here Lord a double blessing father and may you also bless those that are not here Lord bless my pastor father sister ly Lord and all of our Brethren that are out there watching us on the internet if they are in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ we ask that amen amen you may be seated God bless you we'd like to greet our pastor brother Bernie G Garcia [Music] and sister Lily God bless you Pastor amen so today uh we're going to talk a little bit about a champion not a not a uh a Super Bowl champion how many of you know that there's a Super Bowl game going on today right and that's that's the last I'm going to mention about that but today we're going to talk about the true champion our champion the Lord Jesus Christ The Mighty conqueror doesn't that sound like doesn't that sound awesome the mighty conqueror right right when you think of the mighty conqueror you think of maybe a knight dressed in his armor uh going out to slay the dragon right well that's what Jesus did and we're gonna we're gonna talk a little bit about that tonight about our champion and he should be everybody's Champion that is here tonight you know when you have a champion you can you can you you look up to that champion you want to be like that champion and there's no other champion in the world that I would want to be like but the Lord Jesus Christ you know and it's we're going to learn a little bit tonight on how we can be like him by just accepting his gift into our hearts and then watch with that gift in our hearts and the things that it Bears amen so we're going to talk a little bit about about him here in the scriptures so our first scripture is John uh 16 Verse 33 and the scripture reads like this these things I have spoken to you that in me you may have peace so so what what the scripture is telling us here is that these things were spoken unto us that in Jesus we may have peace do you know that there isn't there isn't an amount of money if people were to give you money and say I'm going to give you $1,000 a million dollars and I'm going to take your peace from you it wouldn't be worth it peace is priceless to be at peace with yourself has no price you may say well you may be looking at me saying well brother Mike I don't know a million dollars can bring me a lot of Peace that's not the kind of pie that we're talking about let's read the second part in the world you will have Great Tribulation but it says be of good cheer I have overcome the world so so here the word of God is telling us that we live in a world where there's a lot of trouble yeah there's a lot of trouble a lot of things going on a lot of bad things going on a lot of people suffering and amongst all that stuff he brings us peace and he also tells us he says be happy be of good cheer I was in here on Earth and I overcame these things we can overcome the same things it's a very simple scripture but if we believe it with all of our hearts and understand and say Lord your scripture says that you can bring me peace I need peace Lord I'm always nervous Lord I'm scared this that or the other but you promise Lord and you know that he's truthful because Jesus don't tell little lies or big lies he always says the truth so let's go to our next scripture our next scripture is found in Philippians 4 Phil phili verse 13 so when we have Jesus right the scripture tells us I can do all things through Christ which strengthen me you can do anything in Christ which gives you strength did you know that yeah I see I see her nodding praise the Lord amen that's right there is nothing that can stand before you so if you trust in him he's going to give you peace in the times when there's great trouble he is going to strengthen you and see you through and you know it's not just for the for the little guys and and and little sisters for all of us all we go through different things in our lives oh man you know they they're they're they're laying off people at my job what am I going to do put it give it to the Lord and I promise where one door in your life he'll open another door for yeah that's right man I can be a witness to that amen so he is awesome amen is he your Champion tonight he is a mighty conqueror we're going to read another scripture here we're going to read Romans 55 okay it says now hope does not disappoint so if we have hope in him he's not going to disappoint us have you ever has anybody has this ever happened to anybody oh man you just maybe you're having a birthday or maybe it's you know it's Christmas or something and man you really want something something and you open it up and you think it's going to be what you're going to get and you're like oh man oh this is nice this is great but I would have rather had that racetrack instead of this beautiful sweater right right oh yeah you wanted clothes right you know that's what they tell all of us right I always wanted toys right and then you know a week later we throw the the toy in the closet but he will not disappoint you thank you so so so now why let's read because the love of God the love of God has been poured out in our hearts by the Holy Spirit that was given to us and who gave us the Holy Spirit Jesus said a little while and you will see me no more but he said he was going to send something to us a comforter oh praise the Lord right he was going to give us that Holy because he loves us not loved he loves you right now he loves me right now amen so his holy spirit it's free is GRA free there's nothing that you have to do you you can't buy it you can't bargain for it you know sometimes we bargain wa um uh if I take out the trash all week would you buy me that uh football and if I take it out another couple of weeks and clean my room will I get a new bike see that's kind of bargaining right we're bargaining with our parents and we all do that sometimes I used to right but that's not how it is with God With God all we have to do with Jesus all we have to do is believe him and his holy spirit is a promise for all of us it doesn't matter if you're small big doesn't matter it's a promise and guess what Jesus doesn't break his promises so what do we have to do acts 238 says then Peter said unto them repent and let every one of you be baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and you will receive the gift of the Holy Ghost that's all we got to believe him and to repent some of you are going to start learning about that in Sunday school is to start turning our back so so we're going to say first of all these are wonderful brothers right Brothers smile at the audience and wave but but but for this illustration we're going to say they're sin and I'm walking among the sin right Sinners repent means to turn my back on them and walk the other way that easy see it could be to when you get a thought to do something bad turn your back on it and walk towards what's right so you repent you're sorry for what you did you turn your back on it you're baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ for the remissions of your sins those sins are wiped away completely when you had sins that were written on a page like this let's see brother Jeff back there and when he repented this is what it looked like nothing Jesus took it all the way it's like if it never it's like if it never existed praise the Lord and then he gives you the promise the Holy Ghost is yours we can't look at our condition we just got to say Lord I made another mistake forgive me Lord father let me just pray more Lord and let me just seek you out more Lord and what Caleb said today when he read that scripture in the beginning in Psalms right don't let me lean on what I think so much Lord righty let me let me rely on you and that Holy Ghost begins to come into your life that's a wonderful thing the word of God says that Jesus is like the vine and the vine when it begins to have branches it begins to bear fruit fruit and those fruit are the life of Jesus Christ through you that's right so we're going to learn a little bit more right so Jesus the mighty conqueror while he was here on Earth he conquered sickness he conquered all sorts of things he did great miracles he would pray for people and and and people that were blind and they would be able to see people that were sick would rise up and walk again Lazarus his friend had been dead for a few days and when he and when he arrived he spoke the word and Lazarus resurrected from the dead so he conquered death in a man when he was here on Earth but then came the time where he had to pay the ultimate price an innocent blood was judged here on Earth and they sentenced him to be crucified like the common criminal and he and he was thinking of me and you he thinking of Benji Bernie brother brother Caleb all of us here and he was say I must go through with it that's right and he hung on the cross and he gave up his life that's right yes TR and the Earth shook the Earth sh could you imagine oh what's going on what happened what we do that's what they asked themselves so I want to read I want to read something you from the mighty conqueror from Brother brandham okay he says we see him in his Earthly ministry as a conqueror so remember we talked about all the things he conquered while he was here on Earth but now let's watch him after he died so Jesus died on the cross right he still went on conquering brother brandham said he never ended at the grave the Bible said so his soul descended into hell and he preached to the spirits that were in prison that repented not in the Longs suffering of the days of Noah remember we've all studied about Noah right about how the Lord told Noah to build an ark and he build an arc and then he told told he told Noah to preach to the people and then the people drowned that W in the ark it was sad all of H all of humanity was almost wiped out except for those that were in the ark so that's who Jesus was talking to and then brother BR says I can see him as the heavens and the Earth turning black the rocks are belching out of the mountains meaning the Earth were shaking and the Rocks were coming out the the whole Heavens the moons the Stars refused to shine he conquered it and when he went down descended down this is Jesus now he went down and and descended down he says and knocked at the door where the those lost souls was and when the doors came open those people who laughed and made fun of Enoch who made fun of Noah remember oh no you're crazy it's not going to rain why are you building that big boat that crazy old person right yeah that's what they did they weren't very nice to Noah I can hear him say that's Jesus I can hear him say I am the one that Enoch said would come with 10,000 of his Saints why didn't you believe Enoch said would come with 10,000 of his Saints why didn't you believe Enoch why didn't you believe Noah everything had to know that he' conquered when he shut the door on them the days of Mercy had passed oh my God that's that's a bad deal there on down into the lowest pits of hell so he kept climbing down further down into hell he went and he knocked at the suity doors of the devil's hell and the Devil comes to the door as we could look to see and there he said well here you are after all I sure thought I had you when I killed the prophets so now we know who killed the prophets right the devil okay I L I was sure I had you when I had John's head cut off in prison yeah but now after all you got here I can hear him as he said he straightened himself up said Satan I'm I'm the Virgin born son of the Living God my blood is still wet on the cross Jesus said I paid the price I paid the price I've conquered and I've come down to take overo strip you of everything that you claim you had so he told the devil I'm going to strip you of everything you think you have reached over to his side Bernie come here for a second and this is Bernie but we're just going to say that I'm Jesus and we're not going to say who the other guy is but he saw the keys there and Jesus told him I'm going to strip you of everything give me those and he took the keys and look at him he was huh he's like man what's going on here reached over to his side took the keys of death and hell and Ked them back to the place where he belonged he conquered hell when he rose he had the keys of death hell hanging at his side Jesus did not stay in the grave that's right he went down into hell and he took those keys from the devil that bluffer and he conquered for me you and all of us here that's why he's our conqueror that's why he's our champion and that's why we're here tonight amen amen all right what a great thing it is amen he's awesome why don't we give him an Applause so now you know something that maybe some of your friends don't know man you think the Hulk is a superhero you think Iron Man is a superhero let me tell you they have nothing on the Lord Jesus Christ praise the Lord we all stand so remember he gives us peace we can believe in him and trust in him because he's going to keep his promises he's going to be true to us he's going to strengthen us and help us through the tough times through love he has sent his holy ghost for all of us so that we can endure so that we can hold on and that he can shine through us that's right to other people and one day we're going to be like him
