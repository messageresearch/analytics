[13:28] promises
[13:30] and Lord you manifest your time every
[13:32] time we manifest our belief in
[13:34] [Music]
[13:38] you and Lord you reveal yourself in your
[13:41] own
[13:44] word and once again in this evening we
[13:46] come
[13:49] believing we come believing once
[13:54] again that Lord you have something
[13:56] special for us in this evening
[14:00] we need you at every
[14:04] instant we know Lord that without you we
[14:07] cannot do
[14:10] anything and we know that we are
[14:14] insufficient but father we come
[14:18] believing that you paid the
[14:21] price for every
[14:23] sin for every
[14:25] pain for every
[14:28] illness
[14:30] that's why Lord we come trusting in
[14:34] that and we pray Lord that
[14:38] you as your word is voiced
[14:41] out that you manifest
[14:46] yourself and may you pour out your
[14:49] presence upon every
[14:51] Spirit upon every one of each

[15:20] out May the sick be delivered

[15:27] free the power of your
[15:33] word because there's nothing greater
[15:36] that you have given to
[15:38] mankind than your own
[15:42] word that's why even your own son
[15:46] said when he was tempted by the
[15:49] tempter he said it is
[15:51] written it is
[15:56] written and Lord it is written that

[32:43] down I want to need read another scri
[32:46] two
[32:48] scriptures 1 John chapter 4 uh
[32:54] 18 there is no fear in love but perfect
[32:58] love casteth out fear because fear hath
[33:00] torment and he that fearth is not made
[33:03] perfect in
[33:13] love and in the Book of Joshua chapter 1
[33:17] verse
[33:20] 13 remember the word which Moses the
[33:23] servant of the Lord commanded you saying
[33:26] the Lord your God had given you rest and
[33:28] had given you this
[33:39] land um if I could give a maybe a small
[33:42] title to this
[33:45] message it would be a a real
[33:50] prisoner a real
[33:52] love a real
[33:54] fight you know um this morning
[33:58] I was privileged to be up with the youth
[34:00] in the South
[34:03] Mountain and as we were up in the in the
[34:05] mountain
[34:07] there in the big
[34:09] Rada it was such a beautiful
[34:12] site as you're up in the
[34:15] mountains well first of all I remember
[34:17] our prophet and and various messages
[34:19] when he came and he spoke in
[34:24] Phoenix he would go up there maybe by
[34:27] himself or with sister
[34:30] maida he would look over the
[34:32] valley you know in those times it was of
[34:35] course the
[34:36] different less buildings less
[34:39] houses less
[34:42] pollution less sin less problems but I
[34:46] remember how he used to talk about those
[34:49] times and I was as I was up there this
[34:53] morning I I see I it was just beautiful
[34:56] to me
[34:58] you know when you're up in a
[35:00] mountain uh you're at a different
[35:02] elevation you
[35:06] know and when you're up in a different
[35:08] elevation you're so far
[35:11] away you see things in a different uh
[35:14] sight in a different way you
[35:18] know it it gives you uh um a feeling of
[35:22] wanting to take a picture or something
[35:24] of how beautiful it
[35:26] looks
[35:28] maybe you want to take a
[35:31] selfie but it's beautiful up
[35:33] there and then as you drive down and
[35:37] then you start going towards the
[35:39] neighborhoods and and the and the
[35:42] streets it it looks a little bit
[35:45] different you know it it doesn't look
[35:48] quite as appealing you
[35:50] know you get closer to the to the
[35:53] pollution the noise
[35:56] pollution you you see things that you
[35:59] didn't see from up on
[36:01] top you you you you see the the the
[36:04] Circle Caves and the people walking and
[36:07] whatnot and then you realize that that
[36:10] you know there's a lot of people who are
[36:12] prisoners and in
[36:16] life prisoners to
[36:18] sin prisoners to
[36:21] unbelief you see uh people who who who
[36:26] believe they have a love with in
[36:30] them it's a manufactured
[36:32] love but in reality it's it's not a true
[36:37] love you see people that are
[36:40] fighting they're fighting for something
[36:43] you know I learned because of this
[36:46] message that that you're fighting for
[36:48] one way or or the
[36:50] other you know we all have a cause in
[36:54] life you fight for this or you fight for
[36:56] that
[36:58] you you fight for good or
[37:00] evil like an old country western
[37:03] movie you either for the Cowboys of the
[37:08] Indians not that any one of them is good
[37:10] or
[37:12] bad but you're always fighting for
[37:15] something and if you're not fighting for
[37:18] something then then what are you doing
[37:21] are you truly even
[37:23] living you know so then um as I as I go
[37:26] to this uh this word this
[37:30] message I realize that that we're we're
[37:33] we're we're prisoners
[37:35] also we're prisoners either to one thing
[37:38] or the
[37:39] other to good or
[37:42] bad we're prisoners to to believing or
[37:45] or prisoners to
[37:48] unbelieving we're prisoners to the world
[37:52] or prisoners to Christ and and it's and
[37:55] it's our
[37:56] choice Moral Moral agency that we have
[37:59] that God given
[38:01] us that we're either a prisoner to to
[38:04] the
[38:05] world or prisoner to Christ you know and
[38:09] and uh and know it says that if you have
[38:11] the love of the world in
[38:14] you then you have not the love of God in
[38:17] you so you either love the world or you
[38:19] love
[38:22] God you know which one is it you know

[38:33] and narrow
[38:34] way take God's way you know to where
[38:38] your burdens are are are are taken off
[38:41] of
[38:42] you you know when you're a prisoner of
[38:44] the
[38:45] world you know a prisoner of
[38:48] sin and and and I can just tell you this
[38:50] night I'm preaching to myself
[38:53] okay if anything I'm going to receive
[38:55] something tonight because this is
[38:58] something that I've lived
[39:00] okay so nobody get offended here
[39:02] tonight this something that I've lived
[39:04] through okay so being a prisoner of the
[39:08] world you know you you believe you you
[39:12] uh maybe you have a cause for
[39:16] something you believe you have a right
[39:18] to
[39:19] things you know we you know as you see
[39:22] on TV and the news and whatnot social
[39:26] media
[39:28] and you believe that you got a right to
[39:30] this and a right to that you
[39:32] know people nowadays they got the
[39:36] rights you know their animals have their
[39:40] rights man cats and dogs got more rights
[39:42] than
[39:44] us if you're a
[39:46] dolphin forget about it you can't even
[39:49] be
[39:49] touched but as a human being you know we
[39:52] feel that we have
[39:54] rights you know and and and that you
[39:57] deserve this or you deserve
[39:59] that you know and and and if you're not
[40:02] a prisoner to
[40:04] Christ if you're not a prisoner of
[40:07] love then then what are you a prisoner
[40:14] of well so as I was walked through this
[40:19] this Valley of the shadow of
[40:23] deathful valley of Phoenix Arizona pH I
[40:26] walked as
[40:28] prisoner you know there were some times
[40:30] where I spent uh time in in in in the
[40:32] jail system
[40:35] here I wish brother Alex could have
[40:37] preached to me one of those
[40:40] times know he used to be a minister for
[40:43] the gel
[40:46] systems you know but wherever you're
[40:49] at God can speak to you God can set you
[40:53] free he can take you out of those
[40:56] prisons but you know uh being as a
[40:59] prisoner of
[41:01] sin I I I didn't I I didn't know that
[41:04] that I was really a
[41:07] prisoner I thought I had my
[41:10] freedom I thought I had my
[41:13] rights you know I just I just wanted to
[41:15] be free in
[41:17] life but not realizing that that I was
[41:21] captive I was captive to my
[41:23] thoughts captive to My Flesh and
[41:27] I was a
[41:29] prisoner down to the bone I was a
[41:33] slave my slave
[41:36] master this flesh this sin this world it
[41:42] had me bound down so
[41:44] bad that I didn't even realize that I
[41:47] was a prisoner of
[41:49] it you know uh when when you
[41:55] love when you love
[42:00] I love the way brother Brandon says
[42:02] it you know when you love it goes
[42:05] together with
[42:06] faith you know it's like like sisters
[42:11] or or it's just they go one with
[42:14] another love and faith if you truly have
[42:18] love if you have love for your brother
[42:21] sister your husband
[42:24] wife it there's a faith about it
[42:28] when you have love for
[42:29] God there there's something about it
[42:32] there's no doubt about
[42:34] it you you love him and you know that he
[42:38] loves
[42:39] you you there's it's a guaranteed thing
[42:42] that because he paid the
[42:44] price you've seen where he's brought you
[42:46] out
[42:47] of you understand that it's by
[42:50] grace and that that you didn't earn
[42:54] nothing unmerited that he just loved you
[42:58] because of he wanted
[43:01] to regardless of what situation you're
[43:05] in regardless of how filthy we
[43:08] are how violent you can
[43:11] be what condition you can be in
[43:14] regardless of how much Darkness you
[43:16] could be
[43:18] in that loving
[43:21] God can come down and just
[43:25] say I love you
[43:28] it's a hard thing to
[43:30] believe believe me it's a hard thing to
[43:35] believe that this that God can love
[43:39] something so
[43:41] filthy but it's the truth and he's a
[43:45] gentleman
[43:48] patient just waiting to love
[43:52] you and when you when you can accept
[43:55] that then he can truly love
[43:58] him can truly have faith in
[44:01] him you know to
[44:05] me the opposite of
[44:08] Love is hate you know you you we might
[44:11] think that you know living in
[44:14] life that we have love for our
[44:17] brothers we have love for our
[44:21] sisters our husband for God how many
[44:25] times did I come to the altar
[44:27] oh Lord I love you Lord I worship you
[44:32] Lord I love you with all my
[44:34] heart you know me
[44:36] Lord I love you then I go back into the
[44:40] outside and boom I I make the same
[44:43] mistake over
[44:44] again and over and over and I come back
[44:48] to the altar Lord I love you I love you
[44:53] and and he he looks
[44:55] down and he says
[44:57] but but if you love me you wouldn't be
[45:00] doing that people wouldn't be in this
[45:03] situation all
[45:05] over I'm beginning to think you're a
[45:07] liar
[45:10] son it's the
[45:14] truth God is God is good all the time
[45:19] but he's a jealous
[45:20] God and he wants all of you he don't
[45:23] just want 99% of
[45:25] you the whole thing front and back he
[45:29] wants all of you all of us to be able to
[45:34] just dive into
[45:36] him into love to to to take out the
[45:41] fear take out the hate take it all out
[45:44] of our
[45:45] lives so we can truly
[45:48] live truly love so that we can be a
[45:51] prisoner to him prisoner to Christ a
[45:55] prisoner to his word
[45:57] prisoner to love be yolked with such
[46:02] love in regardless of what comes our
[46:05] way regardless of what the holy spirit
[46:09] says that you just say yes Lord yes Lord
[46:13] and you walk and you talk as as you as
[46:18] if you really did love him regardless of
[46:21] the
[46:22] situation how tired you are what your
[46:26] condition is
[46:28] out of love realizing from what he did
[46:30] for
[46:31] you you want to just love
[46:34] him to serve him you just want to
[46:38] worship Him in truth and in spirit not
[46:41] just in truth or not just in spirit but
[46:46] with the word
[46:49] completely in truth and in
[46:52] spirit a double compound
[46:55] thing
[46:58] amen you know we fight
[47:01] man we fight through
[47:04] hell we
[47:06] fight you know U there was this's his
[47:10] brother his name is Edgardo
[47:13] Riva and we happen to sing a song there
[47:15] in
[47:17] Peru and this I believe the song was
[47:25] called and uh
[47:30] faith is not a gift it's a
[47:34] victory and that stuck to
[47:37] me Faith is it's not a gift it's a
[47:43] victory you got to fight for it got to
[47:46] fight for your
[47:48] character it's a fight it's a battle
[47:52] it's not something that's given to
[47:54] you and then I thought about well then
[47:59] Grace the gift of the Holy
[48:01] Ghost the new birth it's
[48:05] unmerited it's not something you fight
[48:08] for something that's
[48:11] given so here we go in
[48:13] life we're fighting for something we as
[48:17] potential
[48:20] Christians the sons of God Daughters of
[48:23] God we're fighting for something we're
[48:25] fighting for our inh
[48:28] fighting for a
[48:30] land a Promised Land we fighting to get
[48:34] that fighting every day you know uh uh
[48:38] brother Junior brother eler I'm sorry MC
[48:42] Jun he's been preaching these messages
[48:44] on on on mind Warfare
[48:46] right beauti
[48:49] mes and and it's the greatest battle we
[48:53] fought it is a great battle it's for me
[48:57] that great battle doesn't really
[49:00] start doesn't really start until you
[49:04] have received the
[49:06] promise within your heart see before you
[49:10] receive it you believe you're fighting
[49:13] you're fighting for
[49:15] something fighting to receive the holy
[49:18] spirit with the capital
[49:22] S fighting to receive a new
[49:25] birth capital
[49:28] B you're fighting for
[49:30] it every day you're saying Lord you tell
[49:34] your friends oh this is a battle the
[49:38] greatest battle or
[49:39] fight in reality it hasn't even
[49:43] begun it's it's a gift that Holy Spirit
[49:48] the new birth it's not something that
[49:51] you fight
[49:52] for even though you got to fight
[49:54] yourself for
[49:55] it
[49:58] you don't have to fight for it it's
[50:01] unmerited it's Grace nothing you can do
[50:06] can earn it nothing you can do can
[50:09] achieve
[50:10] it it's by Grace he gives it to you
[50:14] because it pleases
[50:16] him Grace you don't have to earn it have
[50:21] to fight for
[50:22] it it's given to
[50:24] you then when it's given to you
[50:28] then when it's unmerited and it's given
[50:30] to
[50:31] you this new
[50:33] nature New Life this new birth this new
[50:38] way of
[50:40] living you no long you no longer have to
[50:43] fight
[50:44] anymore but it's the Holy Spirit within
[50:47] you that's fighting for
[50:50] you you know brother Brandon preached in
[50:52] Africa one
[50:53] time and when he was in Africa and he
[50:57] was preaching out to the ladies out
[50:58] there the
[51:00] sisters calling my sisters receive the
[51:03] Holy
[51:04] Spirit I want to say I was
[51:06] there and as he was preaching to these
[51:09] sisters and they were they were they
[51:11] didn't have clothes on and so as he was
[51:14] preaching to them and the Holy Spirit
[51:17] the pillar of fire came
[51:19] down upon their
[51:22] hearts it
[51:24] automatically they covered themselves
[51:27] they didn't have to fight for that they
[51:30] didn't have to read no scripture about
[51:33] it no one had to tell them but the Holy
[51:37] Spirit within
[51:38] them told them cover yourself when you
[51:43] truly have the Holy Spirit in your
[51:45] heart in your life
[51:49] automatically it starts to cleanse you
[51:52] you know Darkness cannot abide where
[51:54] light is
[51:57] where death
[51:59] is life cannot exist
[52:03] together it's
[52:04] impossible God said let there be light
[52:08] and there was light and the Darkness
[52:10] just ran
[52:11] away Darkness just runs like a
[52:16] little it just runs away it can't just
[52:20] exist when life is
[52:23] there when life is there
[52:27] it's not possible for for death to be
[52:30] there little by little if if you apply
[52:33] the word on a daily
[52:35] basis Grace it just starts to leave it
[52:39] starts to
[52:41] separate like when God told Abraham
[52:43] separate
[52:45] yourself when he finally when he finally
[52:48] listened to the
[52:50] word finally HIIT
[52:52] him that he needed to separate
[52:55] himself then he received the
[52:58] promise then he had the name
[53:00] changed he had no more fear he know then
[53:04] he walk before the
[53:06] Lord so then we fight through
[53:10] hell every
[53:11] day not everybody but some of us I know
[53:16] I did I was fighting to achieve
[53:20] something fighting to receive
[53:22] something and what was I fighting
[53:25] for
[53:27] free unmerited you don't have to fight
[53:30] for
[53:31] it but then when you receive
[53:34] it then the fight
[53:37] starts this is the true
[53:40] fight you want to say with the capital F
[53:43] this is the greatest this is now this is
[53:45] a
[53:49] fight this is a real
[53:52] fight anything before that it's just a
[53:56] blood
[53:58] you thought you were fighting for
[54:00] something but but what were you fighting
[54:04] for fighting for something that's
[54:07] free our character can be
[54:11] formed you can't start to you work on
[54:14] that character until you truly have that
[54:16] in
[54:20] you that
[54:24] promise so to me
[54:27] this is what a true prisoner
[54:29] is to be a prisoner of
[54:32] Christ prisoner of love to be Yol to him
[54:37] a prisoner to his
[54:41] word to love him to love each
[54:45] other to love each other in such a
[54:48] way that it can only be Christ within us
[54:51] loving each
[54:55] other different kind of
[54:57] love you know you know when when you
[55:01] have this type of Love within
[55:05] you you know God
[55:08] automatically I believe he gets you a
[55:10] set of binoculars
[55:12] you when you when you join this
[55:15] battle when he initiates
[55:19] you he gives you your
[55:21] ranks when he gives you your position
[55:25] in gives you your your necessary
[55:29] artillery he gives you your gun your
[55:33] sword he gives you a pair of
[55:36] binoculars and with this pair of
[55:39] binoculars you're able to see long
[55:43] distance you take off those
[55:46] binoculars and and and you might see
[55:49] someone who's
[55:50] struggling you might see a prostitute on
[55:53] the
[55:55] street you know a brother who has
[55:59] fallen you might look at them maybe with
[56:04] disgust but but when you see through
[56:06] binoculars of these
[56:09] Faith you see something
[56:12] different you're not seeing what's
[56:14] happening right
[56:16] now but God gives you different type of
[56:19] a
[56:20] vision a vision of an
[56:23] eil able to see long distance
[56:28] he puts you up on a
[56:30] mountain where you see nothing but
[56:34] Beauty and you and you see the good in
[56:37] people maybe the potential what someone
[56:39] can
[56:41] be you know when Jesus came and walked
[56:44] on this
[56:47] Earth he didn't come to save the phes
[56:50] and that
[56:54] sades although some got
[56:57] saved he came to the
[56:59] world but who are his rightand
[57:03] men who were the ones that that were
[57:06] part of that
[57:08] Circle they were the
[57:10] thieves the Liars the prostitutes the
[57:14] thief on the on the cross next to
[57:18] him you know he came for those
[57:21] people but he had long range
[57:25] vision to see something that we as human
[57:28] beings cannot
[57:31] see he had Faith within him true perfect
[57:36] Faith perfect love and he can see
[57:41] beyond and and and talk to them with
[57:47] love that's love perfect love you know
[57:53] when you don't have
[57:54] love whether in a relationship or in
[57:58] families or with friends or with
[58:03] God you have
[58:05] fear you have doubt and there's no faith
[58:10] there I can testify to you that about
[58:14] that it's a horrible
[58:17] condition you know that you you can't
[58:19] even have love and and and and your your
[58:22] loved
[58:24] ones you can't
[58:27] you all you see is
[58:29] mistakes and maybe they don't even make
[58:32] mistakes but with such an
[58:36] imagination with such a warped
[58:41] mind with such filthy
[58:44] reasoning or maybe with such bad
[58:48] memories or with the
[58:51] Consciousness or or maybe some
[58:53] affections of what happened to you as
[58:54] you were a kid
[58:58] we judge and we judge those people next
[59:01] to
[59:02] us around us and there's no true
[59:07] love because you you have a
[59:09] fear you have doubt about
[59:12] them and it and it just goes bad and bad
[59:15] and
[59:17] bad and I'm almost about to finish the
[59:21] song leader can come
[59:24] up but it it's not a good
[59:27] situation you're fighting through
[59:31] hell you're you're fighting your every
[59:33] inch of the
[59:35] way to
[59:37] Hell through hell it's a horrible
[59:42] condition but when God gives you this
[59:46] Promise by Grace being that it's
[59:50] unmar you you no longer
[59:53] fight sometimes you don't know how you
[59:55] get through it
[59:57] it but it's it's not you that's
[1:00:01] fighting but it's God
[1:00:04] himself his holy spirit that's fighting
[1:00:08] for
[1:00:11] you now you're fighting with a different
[1:00:15] attitude now you're fighting in Heavenly
[1:00:21] places now you're fighting with
[1:00:24] love now you're fighting with the
[1:00:27] word you know when when when Jesus went
[1:00:30] out to the Wilderness and he was
[1:00:34] tempted he didn't he didn't try to
[1:00:37] debate
[1:00:39] Satan he didn't try to challenge
[1:00:42] him just gave him the
[1:00:45] word you didn't have to do anything
[1:00:48] else but he just fought him with the
[1:00:51] word let's just stand up to our
[1:00:54] feet
[1:00:56] every day of my life I believe every day
[1:00:59] of Our
[1:01:01] Lives you know we we should try to
[1:01:05] fight for the real
[1:01:07] cause to be a real
[1:01:10] prisoner to love
[1:01:15] genuinely to fight for the right
[1:01:19] cause you know character I know that
[1:01:22] character is is it's not a gift it's
[1:01:25] it's it's a
[1:01:28] it's a
[1:01:30] victory it's a and it's a it's a
[1:01:35] promise you
[1:01:37] know I don't even know how I'm here
