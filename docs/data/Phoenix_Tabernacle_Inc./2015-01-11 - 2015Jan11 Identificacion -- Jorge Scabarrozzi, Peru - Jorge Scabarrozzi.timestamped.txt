[1:03:08] wife our sister our
[1:03:11] friend our our
[1:03:15] Confidant our
[1:03:18] handkerchief she is our
[1:03:23] everything this

[1:03:32] love I'm in love with
[1:03:35] God I'm in love with his

[1:03:58] the
[1:04:01] mistakes that's why every each and every
[1:04:04] one of us need to fall in
[1:04:07] love when I began to see some mistakes
[1:04:10] in my
[1:04:12] wife it's not that she has a
[1:04:15] mistake it's that my love is growing
[1:04:18] smaller or
[1:04:21] low so then each and every one of us
[1:04:24] needs
[1:04:27] love we should be so deeply in love with
[1:04:30] one
[1:04:32] another I was talking with brother Julio
[1:04:37] C how it is that our Pentecostal
[1:04:41] Brethren could not live far away one
[1:04:44] from the
[1:04:45] other they had Services
[1:04:49] continually and when they would go out
[1:04:51] to say their
[1:04:53] goodbyes
[1:04:55] everyone in the midst of Tears would
[1:04:57] would say their
[1:04:59] goodbye it almost seemed like they would
[1:05:01] never see each other
[1:05:04] again the beautiful thing is that the
[1:05:06] next day there was going to be another
[1:05:09] service so it it's we should be living
[1:05:12] in a higher state than
[1:05:15] that the Brethren that are now asleep or
[1:05:18] dead in Christ
[1:05:21] Jesus they're waiting to be perfected by
[1:05:26] us and truly what crowns that
[1:05:30] building is
[1:05:32] love and where is
[1:05:35] love love is in this
[1:05:39] message where is the
[1:05:42] message it should be in my heart in your
[1:05:46] heart our
[1:05:49] Brethren cannot be
[1:05:51] perfected without us
[1:05:55] what what a tremendous responsibility
[1:05:57] the Lord has
[1:05:59] given we're living in a glorious
[1:06:02] age in a beautiful
[1:06:06] time and at the same time they're very
[1:06:12] dangerous we live now in a world that is
[1:06:15] almost in complete and utter
[1:06:18] Darkness the lights are now drawing
[1:06:23] dim today more than
[1:06:26] ever we need the
[1:06:29] light and Jesus
[1:06:32] said as I am in the
[1:06:34] world I am the light of the world but he
[1:06:38] also
[1:06:40] said ye
[1:06:42] are the light of the
[1:06:46] world Amen my beloved
[1:06:50] Brethren I would like to express some
[1:06:52] personal greetings
[1:06:55] from my brother
[1:07:00] chist he is the pastor in a in a city in
[1:07:03] Peru called
[1:07:05] aripa I was uh talking with him
[1:07:09] yesterday and he asked me to express his
[1:07:12] greetings toward
[1:07:14] you
[1:07:16] Brethren please
[1:07:18] smile would you'd be so
[1:07:22] kind thank you very much
[1:07:25] for me a smile means a
[1:07:28] lot I'm a very introverted
[1:07:31] man I'm very
[1:07:34] timid and that's the reason I am the way
[1:07:37] I
[1:07:38] am and my hands
[1:07:40] sweat my my feet my my legs
[1:07:44] tremble and they're all not only
[1:07:47] words it's a
[1:07:50] truth I thank the Lord
[1:07:52] Jesus for having mercy on
[1:07:56] me for making himself strong in my
[1:08:02] weakness my lips to be able to express
[1:08:05] the word of the
[1:08:07] Lord this morning with much
[1:08:11] love I would like to refer myself unto
[1:08:15] this
[1:08:17] scripture and bring it unto the day that
[1:08:19] we're living in
[1:08:22] today we're living in very confusing
[1:08:26] times very dark
[1:08:28] times if we look on the
[1:08:31] outside it almost seems like there's no
[1:08:34] more
[1:08:35] hope I always heard as a
[1:08:39] child that the young people is the
[1:08:42] future of a country of a
[1:08:45] society or of
[1:08:48] mankind if we look on the
[1:08:52] outside we're going to see see almost
[1:08:54] that the young people has no no guidance
[1:08:58] without any
[1:08:59] orientation they don't have even an
[1:09:02] identi and that says a
[1:09:04] lot that's telling
[1:09:07] us that there's no future
[1:09:11] left that we're almost at the end of
[1:09:15] time that that which Jesus
[1:09:18] spoke what the men of God have
[1:09:21] spoken what brother Branham preached to
[1:09:23] us
[1:09:25] what brother Bernie Garcia preached to
[1:09:27] us what God's
[1:09:30] men have spoken for us is now being
[1:09:36] fulfilled whether we be ready or
[1:09:39] not whether we believe it or
[1:09:43] not that is now being fulfilled before
[1:09:47] our
[1:09:49] eyes and we're not in shock at what is
[1:09:52] happening we are not of this
[1:09:55] world but we are in this
[1:09:58] world we're not from
[1:10:00] here but it pleased
[1:10:04] God for us to be manifested in this
[1:10:07] age now I believe with all my
[1:10:11] heart that I'm not just an
[1:10:15] experiment I'm not a product just of
[1:10:19] coincidence I'm a product of a
[1:10:22] plan A Superior mind thought and spoke
[1:10:28] and
[1:10:29] planned and I and
[1:10:32] you are a
[1:10:35] product of that Eternal
[1:10:38] thought we're not just a
[1:10:41] coincidence we've come to the Earth with
[1:10:44] a
[1:10:46] purpose God sent us to the
[1:10:49] Earth with a
[1:10:52] purpose and the reason for the word of
[1:10:55] the
[1:10:56] Lord is for us to be able to again
[1:11:01] again our mind and obtain our
[1:11:04] mind to be able to know who we
[1:11:08] are who am
[1:11:10] I where am I from where am I
[1:11:15] going why is it that I have been
[1:11:19] manifested those are
[1:11:21] questions that we have to answer
[1:11:28] answer amen my
[1:11:30] beloved there's just not enough
[1:11:35] time I particularly
[1:11:40] think that it's manifested in a very
[1:11:43] difficult
[1:11:45] time I know because of
[1:11:49] history that before you used to preach
[1:11:51] the
[1:11:52] gospel and you would then uh be able to
[1:11:56] uh fish in an
[1:11:58] abundance there was a lot there was an
[1:12:00] abundance of
[1:12:02] fish and now we cast the net of the
[1:12:06] gospel and at times we don't cast
[1:12:10] anything we don't catch anything and at
[1:12:12] times that wants to to make us go into
[1:12:15] depression but that is the
[1:12:17] age in which we have fallen our L to
[1:12:21] live we must be conscious of this to be
[1:12:25] able to not
[1:12:27] suffer to not be
[1:12:30] thinking that yesterday was better than
[1:12:34] today this is the best time for
[1:12:39] us God could not have manifested us in a
[1:12:42] better
[1:12:42] time and I'm
[1:12:45] happy for being able to live my day and
[1:12:50] this
[1:12:51] message recognizing your
[1:12:53] day and your message am amen
[1:13:04] Brethren I've read the book of
[1:13:08] Hebrews I I confess unto you that I
[1:13:11] haven't been able to
[1:13:12] sleep it was 3:30 this
[1:13:15] morning and I was
[1:13:20] sweating I I just was not sleepy
[1:13:24] I had to speak with my guardian
[1:13:26] angel
[1:13:29] Johan brother
[1:13:31] Johan brother
[1:13:34] Johan what do you want he
[1:13:37] said I need you to pray for
[1:13:40] me pray for me I need to
[1:13:43] sleep he prayed for me and two minutes
[1:13:46] later I don't know what
[1:13:48] happened I fell into a deep
[1:13:52] sleep it's a very dangerous
[1:13:55] time I was thinking in my
[1:13:58] mind what's the
[1:14:00] reason that time is so
[1:14:03] dark what is the
[1:14:06] reason that our
[1:14:09] children they're they're just
[1:14:13] disoriented what is the reason that
[1:14:15] there's almost just no hope
[1:14:18] left because if the young people are
[1:14:22] tomorrow and if the young people is
[1:14:27] disoriented then I can understand that
[1:14:29] there's just no
[1:14:31] tomorrow that we're living in the final
[1:14:34] time and I want to make an emphasis
[1:14:37] along with
[1:14:38] you in the scripture that we have
[1:14:41] read and in the
[1:14:45] importance to be able to take out of
[1:14:47] History Our
[1:14:49] Heroes and bring them to today amen amen
[1:14:53] or amen
[1:14:57] Brethren with the lack of
[1:15:03] Heroes because of the lack of
[1:15:06] Heroes our children have as
[1:15:09] Heroes to the to the Avengers
[1:15:13] yes how many have seen the
[1:15:16] Avengers amen or
[1:15:19] amen our children when they're born
[1:15:24] they have a great
[1:15:27] need to identify themselves with someone
[1:15:30] or
[1:15:31] something all of
[1:15:33] us and in our within our inner
[1:15:36] man we have the
[1:15:40] need to identify ourselves with
[1:15:44] something and that something converts
[1:15:46] itself into for us a
[1:15:50] hero for example when the child is
[1:15:54] born it's not mysterious to
[1:15:58] know that their immediate Heroes for
[1:16:02] them should be their parents amen amen
[1:16:05] or
[1:16:07] amen their
[1:16:11] parents we should be for our
[1:16:15] children the heroes that they should
[1:16:19] follow that's the reason why the son
[1:16:25] has to has to be raised amongst those
[1:16:27] two
[1:16:28] influences it's it's just a vital
[1:16:31] importance that for the child to
[1:16:34] be under the shadow of
[1:16:37] dad and under the shadow of
[1:16:41] mom now there's good Heroes and bad
[1:16:45] Heroes There's real
[1:16:48] heroes and there's fictional
[1:16:51] Heroes and as as we don't have our
[1:16:55] children and is
[1:17:00] immediate or close by they begin to
[1:17:02] choose fictitious
[1:17:06] Heroes the word hero
[1:17:12] means uh a man that that converts itself
[1:17:17] into uh an object of great
[1:17:21] admiration that it could be because of
[1:17:23] the model of his
[1:17:25] life or it could be because of his
[1:17:29] behavior the majority of the children of
[1:17:33] children have a hero in their
[1:17:38] infancy Heroes whom they
[1:17:41] admire it might be a real
[1:17:46] hero or an an a fictitious
[1:17:50] hero what is it that surrounds a
[1:17:54] child first it's the
[1:17:56] parents second it's the
[1:17:59] Brethren the family the
[1:18:02] friends they are
[1:18:05] called to be the
[1:18:09] heroes children that are learning to
[1:18:12] live now the reason
[1:18:15] is that that's going to allow that
[1:18:19] child stability to have stability
[1:18:23] because a
[1:18:25] hero is a model or a role model to to
[1:18:29] follow I was
[1:18:32] observing that children don't learn much
[1:18:35] from the speaking or from the
[1:18:38] word they learn by
[1:18:43] example so then I can
[1:18:46] understand why it is that brother bradam
[1:18:48] said
[1:18:51] preacher Don't Preach me a thousand
[1:18:55] sermons just live
[1:18:58] one and who is that first preacher for
[1:19:01] the
[1:19:01] child if it's not
[1:19:05] mom please raise your hand female
[1:19:10] preachers thank
[1:19:12] you amen or
[1:19:16] amen
[1:19:18] Brethren I'm 46 years
[1:19:21] old
[1:19:24] I have the privilege to have my mom
[1:19:26] still living at 64 years of
[1:19:29] age every time that I see
[1:19:33] her she captures me to preach to
[1:19:39] me and that's something that's just
[1:19:41] natural in
[1:19:44] women women was just made to
[1:19:48] give she's always
[1:19:51] transmitting
[1:19:53] it's in her to
[1:19:55] nurture nurture her
[1:19:59] children them with the word of the
[1:20:04] Lord so then what's the best example for
[1:20:07] a
[1:20:10] child it's not so much what mom or dad
[1:20:12] say with their
[1:20:16] mouth it's the example which they
[1:20:18] observe in
[1:20:21] us because the example that they
[1:20:24] observe will turn into for them in a
[1:20:29] foundation in a role
[1:20:33] model if Darkness or evil has
[1:20:38] grown it's due to the lack of
[1:20:41] Heroes and due to the lack of
[1:20:46] Heroes incorrect our children are
[1:20:48] choosing incorrect Role Models Michel
[1:20:51] they follow Michael Jackson
[1:20:54] they follow Michael
[1:20:56] Jordan their hero is
[1:20:59] Superman the other hero is
[1:21:02] Spider-Man due to the lack of
[1:21:06] Heroes our children in their
[1:21:10] need to acquire a
[1:21:14] personality they're looking for a role
[1:21:18] model and at times when our
[1:21:21] children find them eles in
[1:21:25] trouble it's not so much because the
[1:21:27] devil is playing a trick on
[1:21:30] them but it might
[1:21:35] be that we're not being the right role
[1:21:38] mod
[1:21:39] for that is the
[1:21:43] need and that is the reason why us as
[1:21:47] [Music]
[1:21:49] parents must surrender completely to the
[1:21:52] Lord Jesus
[1:21:55] and through that surrendered
[1:21:57] life then we can be for
[1:22:00] them the
[1:22:02] example and that role
[1:22:06] model and that role model to follow
[1:22:09] thank
[1:22:16] you amen my beloved
[1:22:21] brethren
[1:22:23] are the heroes in the life of our
[1:22:28] children homes they need
[1:22:33] [Music]
[1:22:35] Heroes I remember in my imagination or
[1:22:38] in it as a
[1:22:42] child my dad was about six feet tall I
[1:22:45] can imagine he was he was a big
[1:22:50] man I remember when he was resting on
[1:22:53] his
[1:22:54] bed he was my
[1:22:57] everything he was my
[1:22:59] hero I saw his strong
[1:23:04] arms and I wouldn't grow tired of
[1:23:06] looking at
[1:23:08] him he was my role model to
[1:23:11] follow when he
[1:23:14] left I saw myself with the
[1:23:16] obligation to look for a
[1:23:19] father in every man that I would look on
[1:23:24] that's the reason why I would stand
[1:23:26] amongst the older the
[1:23:30] adults and my mom would say well my my
[1:23:32] son likes to go around with
[1:23:34] adults she did not
[1:23:37] know that I was looking for a father
[1:23:40] fig that I was looking for a
[1:23:44] hero I was looking for a role model to
[1:23:48] follow because I was growing
[1:23:50] up how important
[1:23:54] it is for the
[1:23:56] children to have the right
[1:23:59] influence the right
[1:24:02] example through their
[1:24:09] parents whatever you place on your
[1:24:14] child shall be there for their whole
[1:24:18] life that's why the Bible
[1:24:21] says instruct the child in his
[1:24:25] way and even when he is
[1:24:28] old he shall not leave
[1:24:32] it I remember when I went to start
[1:24:35] studying at six years
[1:24:40] old and in parallel they would teach me
[1:24:44] to
[1:24:46] write but at the same time they would
[1:24:49] teach me the history of
[1:24:51] Peru
[1:24:53] and the first thing they taught me was
[1:24:55] who my heroes were Miguel Miguel
[1:24:58] Francis franciscoi Marano M Marano
[1:25:03] mgar Roberto esari Roberto escavar Roi
[1:25:08] my
[1:25:11] hero now that I'm 46 years of
[1:25:14] age I asked myself why would they do
[1:25:19] that and it was to give me an identity
[1:25:23] because if I'm
[1:25:26] Peruvian I have to know my
[1:25:31] history I have to know the founding
[1:25:35] fathers because they're going to fill in
[1:25:37] me that
[1:25:40] void of Personality amen amen
[1:25:49] Brethren on a certain occasion I heard
[1:25:51] brother Bernie preach
[1:25:54] preach the law of
[1:25:59] meditation and there he speaks to us in
[1:26:01] just a precious
[1:26:03] way how it is that David entered into
[1:26:09] depression the Bible says that David
[1:26:11] could not close his
[1:26:13] eyes it says that he would refuse to be
[1:26:20] comforted he thought that God's Mercy on
[1:26:22] him had
[1:26:25] finished that the Bible says that he
[1:26:27] would ask or
[1:26:29] question he would consider himself that
[1:26:31] he was
[1:26:34] undone he would suffer at the thought
[1:26:37] that he was
[1:26:39] born but then verses as you
[1:26:43] continue David arrives at the
[1:26:47] conclusion that it was his
[1:26:49] fault it was not God's fault
[1:26:53] and if we continue on
[1:26:57] reading in the first verses of chapter
[1:27:02] 7 you can EST the law of meditation is
[1:27:07] established and there David is speaking
[1:27:09] to
[1:27:10] us how it is that
[1:27:14] we must teach our
[1:27:17] children from
[1:27:19] mouth to
[1:27:21] ear we must
[1:27:23] speak amen or
[1:27:28] amen if we don't speak with our
[1:27:31] children and I include myself in
[1:27:34] this because as I thought on this
[1:27:39] sermon I find myself still with
[1:27:44] defects I find that I'm not doing the
[1:27:46] right
[1:27:48] thing that it's not enough just in
[1:27:50] taking them to church
[1:27:54] it's not enough for just buying them a
[1:27:57] Bible it's not enough just to dress them
[1:28:01] right there's a deeper work to
[1:28:07] do we must establish the word of the
[1:28:10] Lord in our
[1:28:13] homes we must give the word of the
[1:28:16] Lord the place that it
[1:28:20] deserves and the place that the word
[1:28:23] deserves is the first
[1:28:25] place the word of
[1:28:28] God should
[1:28:31] govern our
[1:28:38] homes I have two small
[1:28:43] children my oldest is already working
[1:28:45] he's 19 years
[1:28:48] old fo and they're reading the martyrs
[1:28:51] of fox or or Fox book of
[1:28:54] Martyrs they read this book
[1:28:58] aloud it's not easy to make them
[1:29:01] read we have to kind of do a business
[1:29:04] dealing
[1:29:06] there and part of that
[1:29:09] negotiation I want to teach my
[1:29:12] children that everything in life it has
[1:29:16] a
[1:29:17] price if you read I'll give
[1:29:20] you
[1:29:23] if you don't read I won't give you any
[1:29:25] money and my wife says what are you
[1:29:29] doing I want to teach my
[1:29:34] children that everything in life has a
[1:29:38] price our Salvation has a
[1:29:41] price our joy has a
[1:29:45] price our healing has a
[1:29:50] price one had to pay the
[1:29:55] price so then when they began to
[1:29:59] read the way that our ancestors
[1:30:04] died I began to
[1:30:06] tremble I began to
[1:30:08] cry I cannot believe
[1:30:11] it so then I come to the
[1:30:14] conclusion why Abraham Lincoln was so
[1:30:17] great and he
[1:30:20] comments that his mom gave him two books
[1:30:24] the
[1:30:25] Bible and fox book of
[1:30:27] Mart what his mom
[1:30:31] did is to establish in the life of
[1:30:34] Abraham
[1:30:36] Lincoln the Heroes of
[1:30:40] Faith and that is what we have
[1:30:43] needed we must
[1:30:48] understand that faith has its Heroes
[1:30:52] and we must not forget
[1:30:55] them we have to bring them to our
[1:30:59] presence and not only stay in
[1:31:02] that but ask unto the Lord that he help
[1:31:07] us also to be able to convert
[1:31:11] ourselves into Heroes of
[1:31:15] Faith if
[1:31:18] evil taking control of mankind
[1:31:22] it's due to the lack of
[1:31:26] Heroes where are the heroes of the
[1:31:30] faith those that are willing to
[1:31:32] sacrifice
[1:31:34] themselves to give up
[1:31:38] everything so someone else can
[1:31:45] benefit amen my
[1:31:50] brethren history brother Paul Garcia
[1:31:53] taught
[1:31:55] me where did you talk so much with
[1:31:59] him very well brother when he arrived in
[1:32:05] Peru in two minutes I'm going to express
[1:32:11] something wisdom cannot be
[1:32:14] taught there's not there's no no way
[1:32:17] that wisdom can be
[1:32:19] taught there's no schools to be able to
[1:32:22] teach
[1:32:23] wisdom wisdom is
[1:32:31] transmitted then by the grace of God I
[1:32:33] found myself with this wise man of
[1:32:35] God I wanted to be next to
[1:32:39] him because just one little
[1:32:42] phrase meant so much to
[1:32:45] me I don't know if it for for you but
[1:32:49] for me one phrase changed my life
[1:32:52] one phrase saved my mom's
[1:32:56] home my life is based on
[1:33:02] phrases you don't need to talk to
[1:33:04] somebody for five
[1:33:06] hours to know what they have in their
[1:33:11] heart brother Bram said let me speak to
[1:33:13] somebody for three
[1:33:15] minutes and I'll tell you who they
[1:33:19] are let me see what they see
[1:33:23] let me see how they
[1:33:25] speak let me see how they
[1:33:27] stand let me see how they
[1:33:30] dress and I will tell you who he
[1:33:34] is we are written Epistles we are
[1:33:39] books and someone is reading
[1:33:41] us now there's good
[1:33:43] books and there's bad books amen amen
[1:33:46] amen or
[1:33:50] amen what kind of books do we want to
[1:33:57] be and there I tried to take
[1:34:01] advantage of the short amount of time
[1:34:03] that he could dedicate to
[1:34:06] us and on a certain occasion he told
[1:34:10] me
[1:34:12] history is m is
[1:34:18] memory I don't know if this makes you
[1:34:20] rejoice
[1:34:23] but for me it's a very deep
[1:34:26] thought because when we have no
[1:34:31] memory we have forgotten our
[1:34:35] history it's because we've forgotten who
[1:34:37] we
[1:34:38] are we don't even know where we come
[1:34:41] from we ignore where we're
[1:34:45] headed we've forgotten Our
[1:34:48] Heroes those Anonymous Heroes that gave
[1:34:52] up their
[1:34:53] life so that the gospel could
[1:34:58] continue today we have access to the
[1:35:01] word of the lord it's because of those
[1:35:06] Heroes that gave up their life willingly
[1:35:08] and
[1:35:09] joyfully for you and I amen amen
[1:35:19] Brethren children learn more from the
[1:35:22] example than from the words that they're
[1:35:24] spoken
[1:35:27] to how
[1:35:30] important it is to understand
[1:35:36] this if we could understand just that
[1:35:38] simple
[1:35:42] phrase the change that we're just
[1:35:44] waiting so much
[1:35:48] upon is going to begin to take form
[1:35:52] amen
[1:35:54] Brethren the help that we have need
[1:35:57] of is so close to
[1:36:01] us it's found in the word of the
[1:36:04] Lord as children of
[1:36:08] God God has sent us
[1:36:14] complete brother Bram said that the
[1:36:16] grain of wheat does not need
[1:36:19] anything everything that she has need of
[1:36:22] is found in in
[1:36:24] her everything that you or I have need
[1:36:29] of is found within
[1:36:33] us I remember the first time I came
[1:36:39] here I spoke to you with permission from
[1:36:42] my brother
[1:36:44] Bernie about my
[1:36:47] heroes I I spoke um to brother Bernie
[1:36:50] Garcia PA I I also mentioned brother
[1:36:53] Paul
[1:36:54] Garcia I mentioned brother
[1:36:58] l i I mentioned Cal perz who was also in
[1:37:01] the audience Fabi Bernal I I mentioned
[1:37:04] Fabi
[1:37:05] Bernal I mentioned David
[1:37:08] Lucero I even mentioned Alber herandez
[1:37:11] My
[1:37:14] Heroes what would have been of
[1:37:16] me without my
[1:37:19] heroes what would have been of me
[1:37:22] without those role models to
[1:37:24] follow what would have been of me
[1:37:27] without those
[1:37:30] examples but now brother Paul isn't
[1:37:34] here and I'm deeply saddened by
[1:37:36] this and I've asked God how could it
[1:37:42] be that you took a man with so much
[1:37:46] wisdom so then in me has
[1:37:49] awoken a great interest
[1:37:53] interest into looking and searching out
[1:37:55] for his
[1:37:56] work because there is where the wisdom
[1:38:00] is we need
[1:38:02] Heroes I'm 46 years
[1:38:05] old I'm a young
[1:38:09] preacher I'm just barely beginning in
[1:38:11] the ways
[1:38:13] of I'm a I have a great need of
[1:38:16] Heroes and just like I said the first
[1:38:19] time I've come to Phoenix
[1:38:23] Arizona to give honor to my
[1:38:26] heroes you are my
[1:38:29] hero and I don't know if you believe
[1:38:32] it but I believe it with all my
[1:38:36] heart you know what politicians
[1:38:40] say when the United States
[1:38:43] sneezes the whole world has
[1:38:47] flu what it has what does a sneeze have
[1:38:49] to do with my flu
[1:38:53] what they're
[1:38:56] saying is that you are our role models
[1:38:59] to
[1:39:04] follow how incredible brothers and
[1:39:08] sisters that someone
[1:39:11] imitate sometimes we're walking through
[1:39:14] life without knowing that somebody is
[1:39:16] imitating
[1:39:18] us at times we're just walking through
[1:39:21] life just
[1:39:23] wondering without knowing that for
[1:39:25] someone we're going to be an influence
[1:39:27] it might be
[1:39:28] positive or it might be
[1:39:30] negative we're going to be an
[1:39:33] influence and someday we'll be
[1:39:36] responsible I shall be
[1:39:38] responsible for my wife for my
[1:39:42] children for the
[1:39:49] congregation that puts me in a very
[1:39:51] difficult
[1:39:53] situation that takes me to the
[1:39:58] conclusion that the only thing I have
[1:40:00] left is to surrender to the
[1:40:02] Lord not
[1:40:04] 20% not
[1:40:06] 30% not
[1:40:09] 50% oh brother scavi I surrender to the
[1:40:12] Lord oh how much have you
[1:40:14] surrender God
[1:40:17] Demands a complete
[1:40:19] surrenderance
[1:40:22] everything or nothing amen or
[1:40:26] amen God just doesn't want the the
[1:40:28] minuscal
[1:40:29] things God doesn't want just
[1:40:33] a God wants
[1:40:36] everything for me to have the
[1:40:39] courage to surrender completely to his
[1:40:44] word to recognize that without him I am
[1:40:49] nothing Breen I believe with all my
[1:40:52] heart that I'm
[1:40:54] nothing I'm
[1:40:57] unworthy I don't deserve what I'm
[1:41:00] living but I'm thankful unto the
[1:41:02] Lord for that precious
[1:41:05] Grace for that
[1:41:08] Mercy for that love that has been
[1:41:12] expressed because God expressed his love
[1:41:14] for
[1:41:16] me he expressed his love for
[1:41:19] you
[1:41:21] we are a fruit of his
[1:41:24] love it's not by works so no man can
[1:41:29] can I can't boast about my own my own
[1:41:32] doings my works are
[1:41:36] Darkness but I I am I I
[1:41:39] boast of the works of the
[1:41:43] cross I believe we're all resting on
[1:41:45] that amen
[1:41:47] Brethren you have the opportunity
[1:41:53] to be the hero that your child
[1:41:55] needs you have the
[1:41:58] opportunity to be the
[1:42:00] hero of that new
[1:42:04] generation of those young people of our
[1:42:08] children they're looking for
[1:42:13] Heroes why do you think I I I named my
[1:42:17] eldest son
[1:42:19] Peter why do you think I named my second
[1:42:22] son
[1:42:24] bernabe do you think I just placed their
[1:42:26] name that name because it's
[1:42:29] beautiful I I I named him Peter because
[1:42:32] of Pedro
[1:42:33] P I love Pedro P My
[1:42:37] Hero if love were to die down I'm
[1:42:41] indebted for
[1:42:44] life why do you think I named bernabe my
[1:42:47] second
[1:42:48] son because of my heroes Bern Gonzalez
[1:42:51] Garcia because of Bern Gonzalez Garcia
[1:42:54] Bern Nikolas Castillo Garcia j Bern
[1:42:57] Nicolas Garcia
[1:42:59] Junior for so I wouldn't
[1:43:02] forget about my
[1:43:04] heroes for me they're
[1:43:08] important why do you think I named my
[1:43:10] daughter B
[1:43:11] letia because it's a beautiful
[1:43:15] name I placed her name B because of
[1:43:18] Pedro Pena's
[1:43:19] daughter ber Lea because of brother
[1:43:22] Bernie Jr's
[1:43:24] wife and Elizabeth because of the love
[1:43:27] of my
[1:43:28] life aren't you in love with magali
[1:43:31] Elizabeth her second name is
[1:43:38] Elizabeth I would like for you to
[1:43:40] understand
[1:43:47] me we all have need of Heroes
[1:43:52] it might be a young
[1:43:54] person it might be an
[1:43:57] adult or you might be an elder
[1:44:00] man we all
[1:44:03] need I lost my
[1:44:07] father and I see in every elder man a
[1:44:10] father
[1:44:12] figure you still don't know what it
[1:44:14] means to me when someone calls me
[1:44:17] son when somebody calls me son
[1:44:21] something within me begins to
[1:44:25] break it's what I wanted to hear the
[1:44:27] most from my
[1:44:29] dad but he's now gone and from that
[1:44:34] day I'm looking for
[1:44:36] dads and if I can hug
[1:44:38] you look at me as your
[1:44:41] son and I'll see you as my father what's
[1:44:44] the
[1:44:46] reason we're all looking for
[1:44:49] Heroes we're looking for a role model to
[1:44:54] imitate if our children are
[1:44:58] wward it's because we have not
[1:45:03] understood that that the heroes have to
[1:45:05] be today
[1:45:10] and if if it's true we should speak to
[1:45:12] them about we should speak to them about
[1:45:16] Matthew about Elijah and Elisha of
[1:45:19] Gideon
[1:45:21] of Mary of
[1:45:23] Rahab we should speak about to them
[1:45:25] about
[1:45:26] them well what about today's
[1:45:28] heroes are there heroes or are there not
[1:45:32] Heroes and I've come once again to this
[1:45:35] country to give my
[1:45:37] tribute my last
[1:45:40] tribute to my hero Paul
[1:45:44] Garcia and I grow emotional as I see him
[1:45:47] sitting in the place of his father I was
[1:45:50] seeing him through the
[1:45:52] screen and I told the brother how
[1:45:55] beautiful someone has taken the place of
[1:45:58] my
[1:46:00] hero oh how beautiful how beautiful that
[1:46:03] is for me it's a show of Love or
[1:46:09] affection for me just a show of
[1:46:11] affection is worth more than a thousand
[1:46:15] words we learn more from the examples
[1:46:18] than we do from words
[1:46:21] and I saw him there
[1:46:23] seated I think that he's preaching to
[1:46:26] me he's telling his mom you're not
[1:46:30] alone we love
[1:46:32] you we're with
[1:46:37] you and we want Dad to be present
[1:46:40] amongst us
[1:46:42] always God's heroes must be
[1:46:47] remembered with all my heart what the
[1:46:49] word of the Lord says
[1:46:52] says brother Bram speaks to us about
[1:46:55] Elijah says Elijah would go into the
[1:46:59] cave and then the crows would come and
[1:47:01] feed
[1:47:03] him and brother Bram says that the crows
[1:47:05] are the
[1:47:07] preachers from that day I understood
[1:47:09] that I am a
[1:47:11] crow am amen or
[1:47:15] amen raise your hand if you're a crow so
[1:47:17] I don't feel
[1:47:19] alone
[1:47:22] it says the crows would give food to eat
[1:47:24] to
[1:47:25] elah Elijah has
[1:47:27] left but the
[1:47:29] crows are still maintain
[1:47:32] alive the voice of
[1:47:36] elishah through the preaching of the
[1:47:38] word
[1:47:40] amen amen or amen
[1:47:44] Breen if we stop talking about
[1:47:48] Elijah that Elijah shall die
[1:47:51] but as we continue to speak
[1:47:53] about as we preach what he
[1:47:57] preached elij is
[1:48:01] alive as we speak about Paul
[1:48:05] Garcia Paul Garcia is
[1:48:07] alive because the
[1:48:10] homage that our heroes
[1:48:13] deserve it's just it's not a funeral
[1:48:17] service flowers there in the grave site
[1:48:21] the
[1:48:23] homage the greatest homage that we can

[2:20:43] spirit amen
[2:20:45] amen I'm just going to be here a few
[2:20:49] minutes and the reason and the purpose
[2:20:52] for
[2:20:55] this this is for all of
[2:20:58] those that do not
[2:21:00] believe that William Mary and Bram Mar
[2:21:04] BR is a prophet of
[2:21:06] God all the visions that he
[2:21:09] had will come to
[2:21:13] pass some have already
[2:21:16] passed some will come to
[2:21:20] pass one of the visions that brother
[2:21:22] Bram
[2:21:24] had he said he saw a car going down the
[2:21:28] road and it was drivers
[2:21:32] L nobody was driving the
[2:21:35] car so now I want you to look at this
[2:21:38] little video for just a few
[2:21:42] minutes watch real carefully watch
[2:21:46] thisas 15 luxury in motion looks like a
[2:21:49] futuristic spaceship on Wheels the car
[2:21:51] can completely drive itself the driver's
[2:21:54] seat rotates 360° so the driver doesn't
[2:21:57] even have to face forward while on the
[2:21:58] road there are no buttons the car is
[2:22:01] controlled by guestures and motions the
[2:22:04] interior is designed to be like a cave
[2:22:06] that offers passengers a secluded
[2:22:08] peaceful environment Mercedes says the
[2:22:10] car's design is all about giving
[2:22:12] customers the true luxury of the future
[2:22:15] this this car gives people back the the
[2:22:18] most precious um Goods they can have
[2:22:20] which is time and space and in this car
[2:22:23] you can move from A to B at the same
[2:22:26] time do whatever you want uh
[2:22:28] teleconference and video conferencing uh
[2:22:31] doing your
[2:22:32] emails communicating with friends uh
[2:22:35] just relaxing sleeping um and all that
[2:22:38] while traveling the car is a concept
[2:22:41] Mercedes says it still needs to figure
[2:22:42] out the most important safety issues
[2:22:44] such as in the case of an unlikely crash
[2:22:47] where the car would decide to head
[2:22:49] towards a ditch or a wall Mercedes says
[2:22:51] it has already started implementing the
[2:22:53] auto driving technology in some of its
[2:22:55] cars and will continue to introduce the
[2:22:57] f-15s technology and style into its
[2:23:00] Fleet over the next decade in Las Vegas
[2:23:03] Nat Finn Fox News
[2:23:06] wow that's what I say look it's been 82
[2:23:11] years
[2:23:14] 1933 brother Bram saw this car
[2:23:18] or a car just like it he said with egg
[2:23:23] shape and that Vision that brother Ram
[2:23:27] said here they're showing it to us now
[2:23:29] man man's showing it to us
[2:23:32] now every Vision that he had
[2:23:35] was he also
[2:23:37] said he said I'll be in a little
[2:23:41] room in a
[2:23:43] tent that's never been
[2:23:46] fulfilled one of the other visions that
[2:23:48] brother Bram
[2:23:51] had it's later than you
[2:24:03] think amen God is
