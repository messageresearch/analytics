[15:41] god bless you tonight we will pick up
[15:46] where we left off in our reading of the
[15:49] series of books called supernatural the
[15:51] life of William Branham we're in book
[15:53] three the man in his commissioned 1946
[15:55] to 1950 written by Oren Jorgenson before
[15:58] we get started just to let you know
[16:00] we're in chapter 32 the title was
[16:02] challenging insanity
[16:03] we know brother Brandon went up against
[16:05] many difficult spirits in his lifetime
[16:09] what you're about to hear is a third of
[16:11] the chapter that's very intense but you
[16:14] what I'd like for our young people to
[16:17] focus on here is that not that you'll
[16:20] find yourself in similar situations but
[16:22] obviously they're going to be times in
[16:23] your lifetime and when you're very young
[16:24] you're going to run up against some very
[16:26] difficult people in spirits pay close
[16:29] attention to how brother Brandon manages
[16:31] the situation and and we hope that it
[16:35] will be a blessing and we'll pick up
[16:37] right now before we get started I need
[16:44] to explain to brother Brennan is in this
[16:46] third stop of series of services and
[16:49] that were being conducted in Arkansas he
[16:52] started in Camden he went on to Fort
[16:56] Smith and then to Little Rock and at
[17:00] this particular point he's in Little
[17:02] Rock he had been praying for several
[17:03] hours for the sick
[17:12] that night after several hours of
[17:14] constant prayer for the sick
[17:15] Reverend Brown said brother Branham let
[17:18] me know when you need a little breather
[17:20] I want to show you something in the
[17:21] basement of the auditorium it's a case
[17:24] like you've never seen before
[17:29] tired from the strain bill welcomed the
[17:32] excuse to rest his mind a little while
[17:34] I'm ready for a break now he said while
[17:37] the people in the prayer line kept their
[17:38] places and waited
[17:40] Reverend Brown led bill to the basement
[17:42] where they met a young man standing on
[17:44] the bottom step of the stairway he
[17:46] looked like a typical Arkansas farmer
[17:48] dressed in a faded blue shirt and bib
[17:51] overalls
[17:52] the man gazed out across the basement
[17:55] with glassy dejected eyes bill looked
[17:57] also and was shocked by what he saw and
[18:00] all his life bill had never seen
[18:03] anything like this in the center of a
[18:05] large room sprawled on a bare floor was
[18:08] a large muscular woman dressed in a
[18:10] white t-shirt and black shorts bill
[18:13] guests she must be 30 or 35 years old
[18:15] she lay on her back with her legs and
[18:18] arms sticking straight up in the air her
[18:20] legs were smeared with blood from
[18:21] numerous cuts looking back at the man on
[18:24] the steps bill asked incredibly brother
[18:28] is that your wife yes brother branham my
[18:32] what is her trouble when she had her
[18:35] last baby the doctor thinks it threw her
[18:37] into premature menopause he gave her
[18:40] some shots but they didn't set right and
[18:42] she went wild she's been an insane
[18:45] institution for two years
[18:46] I sold my farm to get enough money to
[18:49] help her but nothing the doctor has
[18:51] tried has worked brother branham I've
[18:54] got four children at home when I heard
[18:56] about an insane woman from Mississippi
[18:58] who was healed in your meetings the
[19:00] other night I sold my mule to get enough
[19:02] money to bring my wife here in an
[19:04] ambulance while her legs bleeding the
[19:08] Institute said we could take her for
[19:10] just one night but when they tried to
[19:12] put her in the ambulance they couldn't
[19:14] do it so I took four brothers from my
[19:17] church with me and we managed to get her
[19:19] in a car then on the way here all four
[19:21] of those men couldn't hold her still and
[19:23] she kicked all the glass out of
[19:25] the backseat when we brought her into
[19:28] the building she just threw us
[19:29] everywhere finally we got her into the
[19:31] basement and later on her bag she just
[19:33] stayed there like that with her hands
[19:35] and legs up in the air with Penny bill
[19:38] looked at the insane woman lying on her
[19:40] back in the center of the floor her
[19:42] bloody arms and legs sticking straight
[19:44] up in the air bill sent to her husband
[19:47] I'll walk up and hold her hand and see
[19:49] if I can feel any vibrations Tara leaped
[19:52] into the man's eyes brother branham
[19:54] don't you go over there she'll kill you
[19:57] ignoring the warning bill strolled over
[19:59] to the insane woman who watched his
[20:01] approach with intense calculating eyes
[20:03] good evening bill said reaching out
[20:05] towards her right hand just as his hand
[20:08] was circling her wrist she suddenly
[20:10] flipped her palm over and gripped his
[20:12] wrist instead giving him a sharp
[20:14] powerful tug that nearly pulled him off
[20:16] his feet she could not have weighed over
[20:18] 170 pounds but she seemed to possess
[20:20] four times the strength of an average
[20:22] woman as she drew him down close to her
[20:25] bill feared she would break his bones he
[20:28] jerked his foot up caught her across her
[20:29] chest and kicked hard his hand came free
[20:32] and he ran back to the basement steps
[20:35] the insane woman pursued him still on
[20:37] her back slithering her body rapidly
[20:39] across the concrete floor looking like a
[20:42] giant snake all the while making inhuman
[20:44] gurgling noises halfway to the steps she
[20:48] changed her direction and headed instead
[20:49] for a wooden bench sitting up against
[20:51] the wall she struck the corner of that
[20:54] bench so hard with her head that the
[20:56] wood splintered into pieces blood
[20:58] mingled with her hair she picked up a
[21:00] chunk of wood and threw it at her
[21:01] husband missing him by inches and
[21:03] knocking plaster off the wall behind him
[21:05] brother branham the husband saw is there
[21:08] any hope for her look brother said bill
[21:11] putting his arm over the man's shoulder
[21:13] the only thing I know to tell you when
[21:15] that angel met me he told me that if I
[21:18] would be sincere and could get people to
[21:20] believe then he would heal the sick do
[21:24] you have the simple faith to believe
[21:25] that Jesus Christ the Son of God cast
[21:28] out devils mustering his courage the man
[21:32] answered I do when the possessed woman
[21:35] heard this she screeched william branham
[21:37] you haven't got
[21:38] anything to do with me I brought her
[21:41] here then the woman began crowing on her
[21:43] back towards Bill what's this the
[21:47] husband asked very surprised that woman
[21:49] doesn't even know her own name she
[21:51] hasn't spoken a word in two years that
[21:55] wasn't her CID bill that was the demon
[21:57] who is holding her in his possession he
[21:59] knows he's going to have to leave the
[22:01] woman if you will believe the Lord Jesus
[22:03] Christ right now let's agree in prayer
[22:06] the woman screeched again you have
[22:09] nothing to do with me as built bowed his
[22:12] head and pray Heavenly Father in the
[22:14] name of your son Jesus Christ make that
[22:17] double leave her the woman fell silent
[22:19] in the next moment she collapsed a flat
[22:22] on the floor as though lifeless her
[22:24] husband asked what should I do now as
[22:27] soon as the service is over take her
[22:29] back to the institution if you will

[46:42] a little fence right here where he keeps
[46:45] some of the goats and some of the labs
[46:48] and maybe the pigs are over here and
[46:50] there's chickens by your feet be careful
[46:52] they bite so just imagine this land
[46:56] it was his he didn't have much but what
[46:59] he had was his just like this family
[47:02] that we have might not be much to
[47:04] somebody but it's ours and you know what
[47:08] Shamgar worked so hard so he was there
[47:11] planting some seeds planting for the
[47:14] harvest with his beautiful family hey
[47:16] guys can you help me plant come on this
[47:19] plan everything that will ever be in
[47:23] this field starts off in this seed
[47:25] it's a wheat okay so you just take this
[47:29] back grab a handful and let's start
[47:31] planting
[47:32] and when they grow you're gonna be able
[47:34] to know the difference between a tear
[47:36] and a wheat see the tears an impostor
[47:40] he'll look like a weak but he's not a
[47:42] weak you can tell by the weak because
[47:45] the seeds they're pretty heavy so it
[47:48] makes the head fall down humbly before
[47:51] God the little tears gonna stick his
[47:53] head up like this all proud or don't
[47:55] worry when harvest comes we'll be able
[47:57] to know the difference it will separate
