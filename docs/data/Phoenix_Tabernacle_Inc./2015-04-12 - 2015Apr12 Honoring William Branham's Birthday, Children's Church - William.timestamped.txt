[36:03] us amen now how many of you are thankful
[36:05] to the Lord
[36:07] amen how many of you are are needy of
[36:09] the
[36:11] Lord amen I just have a little uh a
[36:14] little testimony it's not my
[36:16] testimony but just a little Thanksgiving
[36:18] that I I want to thank the Lord
[36:22] for um on the way from Camp because we
[36:25] came back from Camp last Sunday
[36:31] we got a call that my grandpa was
[36:32] getting taken to the
[36:36] emergency and he's actually here in the
[36:38] back if he could raise his hand just so
[36:40] everyone knows who he
[36:42] is amen that's my
[36:44] grandpa so they had told us that he was
[36:46] getting taken to the
[36:50] emergency and uh we had heard this the
[36:54] the last
[36:55] service
[36:58] and it was going to be time for us to
[36:59] come
[37:01] back amen and it just so happens that
[37:03] the title of Camp
[37:06] was actually let me rephrase that it
[37:08] didn't just so
[37:11] happen it was God who made the camp
[37:16] theme faith is our
[37:18] Victory amen man and it just so happens
[37:21] and not even just so
[37:24] happens a week or two weeks before
[37:26] before that I had preached on a Friday
[37:30] night and the lord gave me the title
[37:33] faces my victory in my
[37:36] life isn't he
[37:39] wonderful so my grandpa's getting taken
[37:41] to the
[37:43] emergency he's in the emergency
[37:46] room and they figured out that it was a
[37:48] heart
[37:51] attack and me me being
[37:55] me I don't know what that's
[37:58] like but I can only
[38:01] imagine the
[38:03] fear the fear of
[38:06] dying you
[38:08] know and I just want to read something
[38:10] here in the message faith is our
[38:14] Victory by brother brandom it reads like
[38:17] this uh but when you see your sins as
[38:20] God sees
[38:22] them in the light of his
[38:24] Bible when you see you'll repent or
[38:29] perish something will take place you'll
[38:32] get to business he
[38:35] says walk out of here in a smothering
[38:37] around your
[38:41] heart the doctor back there maybe will
[38:43] rise up and come up and
[38:49] look and tell you it's a heart
[38:53] attack he says you'll get to business
[38:58] and then he says that's when you get to
[39:02] business and he says and that and the
[39:04] woman is sitting here looking at me
[39:08] now and my grandpa's here looking at me
[39:11] now I
[39:13] believe we serve a living
[39:15] God the same God that healed this sister
[39:18] of her heart
[39:21] attack healed my grandpa of his heart
[39:25] attack
[39:33] amen they didn't find anything wrong
[39:36] with his heart or his
[39:39] brain and I know he's
[39:41] thankful I'm thankful and I just had to
[39:44] say that to you
[39:46] guys because our brother Mario told me
[39:48] told us on Friday
[39:53] night Friday night this past Friday he
[39:56] said that God likes to hear it from your
[40:01] mouth he likes to hear of his his doings
[40:04] in your life but from your
[40:07] mouth he likes when he likes when you
[40:10] talk about him with one
[40:13] another he rejoices up in heaven I
[40:17] believe when he heals his
[40:20] children talking about how grateful they
[40:25] are
[40:27] to be
[40:29] here to be alive to take another
[40:33] breath amen and I'm just thankful for
[40:37] that amen now if you just don't mind
[40:39] bowing your
[40:42] heads and if there's anything that you
[40:44] need from the
[40:45] [Music]
[40:47] Lord I've learned that it's not on your
[40:50] [Music]
[40:51] time it's on his
[40:54] time you know and sometimes we get
[40:58] impatient you know but we just have to
[41:01] wait on the
[41:04] Lord amen let's just bow our
[41:07] heads Lord gracious Heavenly
[41:10] Father Lord thank

[56:49] are true these are things that actually
[56:52] happened in brother bram's life
[56:55] yes Mama I'll listen close okay son do
[56:59] you remember where the story starts in
[57:02] the Log
[57:04] Cabin it All Began on April 6th 1909 in
[57:08] a little Log Cabin way back in the hills
[57:11] of Kentucky inside the cabin Charles and
[57:14] Ella Branham were admiring their new
[57:17] baby boy Charles looked at his firstborn
[57:21] son and said we will call his name
[57:25] William it was a little dark out inside
[57:28] so they opened the window to get a
[57:30] better look at the
[57:31] baby what happened next is so incredible
[57:34] that some people don't believe it
[57:37] happened but it did happen and when the
[57:41] window opened a bright light came into
[57:44] the room and rested over the
[57:47] baby wow Mama the light came into the
[57:50] room with them yes Junior do you
[57:53] remember the story about Moses and the
[57:55] burning bush the light that Moses saw
[57:57] was the same light that came into the
[57:59] cabin that morning even when brother
[58:02] Bram was just a baby God was proving
[58:05] that he would be a prophet like
[58:08] Moses what's a prophet
[58:10] Mama a prophet is a very special person
[58:14] that God sends to help his people now
[58:17] let's keep reading when brother branam
[58:20] was a boy he helped his daddy by
[58:22] carrying buckets of water from a well
[58:25] and one day he was on his way home and
[58:27] he saw a very strange Whirlwind in a
[58:29] tree it stayed in the tree and would not
[58:32] move well then a voice came out of the
[58:35] world Wing saying never smoke drink or
[58:38] defile your body in any way there's a
[58:42] work for you to do when you get
[58:45] older well brother brandham had a dog
[58:48] named Fritz that love to go hunting and
[58:51] Fritz loved to chase AP possums and
[58:53] raccoons but
[58:55] knew better than to chase a smelly
[58:58] skunk but if he patted him and said
[59:01] sicken boy he would run after the skunks
[59:04] anyways he said that good dogs like
[59:08] Fritz will be with us in heaven one day
[59:11] wait wait wait a minute Mama there will
[59:14] be animals in heaven yes Junior do you
[59:17] remember the story of Elijah when the
[59:19] horses and Chariot came from Heaven to
[59:21] pick him up the Bible also says that
[59:24] Jesus will come riding from Heaven on a
[59:27] white
[59:28] horse I think heaven will be a good
[59:31] place don't you Mama I certainly do
[59:34] junior it will be wonderful
[59:36] there and when he got older brother
[59:39] Branham really wanted to become a
[59:41] Christian he wanted to tell God that he
[59:44] was sorry for all his mistakes but he
[59:47] didn't know how to pray so he wrote a
[59:50] letter to God and tacked it to a tree he
[59:53] knew that God lived in nature and would
[59:56] walk by there
[59:58] someday well do you think Jesus ever got
[1:00:01] his letter
[1:00:02] Mama yes I do junior did you know that
[1:00:06] Jesus got his letter before he wrote it
[1:00:10] the Bible teaches us that God knows what
[1:00:13] you are going to do even before you do
[1:00:17] it let's keep reading now this next
[1:00:19] story is your
[1:00:22] favorite as a Young Man brother Branham
[1:00:25] wanted to travel out west to be a cowboy
[1:00:28] he wanted to show everyone how he could
[1:00:30] ride the meanest bucking horse in the
[1:00:33] world and one horse in Arizona called
[1:00:36] the Kansas Outlaw was especially mean
[1:00:40] and after seeing all the Cowboys get
[1:00:42] bucked off he decided that he really
[1:00:45] didn't want to ride that horse so
[1:00:47] brother brandham love the West so much
[1:00:50] he wrote this
[1:00:51] poem I am Lonesome oh so lonesome
[1:00:55] for that far away Southwest where the
[1:00:58] Shadows Fall the deepest Over the
[1:01:00] Mountain Crest I can see a lurking
[1:01:03] coyote All Around The Purple Haze I can
[1:01:06] hear a lowo hollering down with a long
[1:01:09] horns graze and somewhere up the canyon
[1:01:12] I can hear a lion wine in that far off
[1:01:16] Catalina mountains at the araona
[1:01:21] line one night in Indiana brother was
[1:01:24] praying in a field for his daddyy
[1:01:26] because his daddy was not living for
[1:01:28] Jesus and while he was praying he looked
[1:01:31] up and saw the Lord Jesus standing close
[1:01:35] to him Jesus was a small man he was
[1:01:38] wearing a white robe and looked very
[1:01:42] peaceful brother brandham said
[1:01:45] Jesus then Jesus turned to him and
[1:01:48] raised his arms out mama if we say his
[1:01:53] name will he hear hear us like he heard
[1:01:55] brother
[1:01:56] Branham he certainly will honey he is
[1:01:59] with us right now and he is always ready
[1:02:02] to listen to
[1:02:04] us well I'm not afraid of the storm
[1:02:06] anymore but I want to hear more of the
[1:02:09] story junior
[1:02:13] said brother bunny do you want to come
[1:02:15] up
[1:02:16] and be a bit interactive and act like
[1:02:19] brother Brandon for me please thank you
[1:02:23] and after brother Bram became a minister
[1:02:26] he baptized many people in the Ohio
[1:02:31] River one day a bright light came down
[1:02:34] from the sky a voice thundered from
[1:02:36] Heaven saying as John the Baptist was
[1:02:40] sent to forerun the first coming of
[1:02:42] Christ your message will forun the
[1:02:44] second coming of
[1:02:46] Christ and many years later he went to a
[1:02:50] cabin to
[1:02:51] pray late that night he saw a light
[1:02:55] shining on the
[1:02:57] floor and then an angel came walking
[1:03:00] into the light and said fear
[1:03:04] not brother brandham was scared until he
[1:03:07] heard that voice as soon as he heard it
[1:03:11] he knew it was the same voice that had
[1:03:13] spoken to him in the Whirlwind when he
[1:03:15] was a little
[1:03:16] boy the angel told him that he would go
[1:03:19] around the world and pray for Kings
[1:03:22] monarchs and other great men but not to
[1:03:25] fear because he would always be with him
[1:03:30] the angel also told brother Brandon the
[1:03:33] people would believe him because he
[1:03:35] would know the secrets in their
[1:03:39] hearts so one morning brother brandham
[1:03:42] was fishing with
[1:03:44] friends a little fish they had caught
[1:03:47] died and was floating near the
[1:03:50] bank the Lord told him to stand up and
[1:03:54] say little fishy I give you your life in
[1:03:58] the name of Jesus
[1:04:00] Christ and when he did the fish
[1:04:03] immediately came back to life and swam
[1:04:07] away one of brother branham's favorite
[1:04:09] things to do was squirrel hunt so one
[1:04:12] day he was hunting when it was very
[1:04:15] windy squirrels don't like wind so there
[1:04:19] were none to be found he asked Jesus for
[1:04:23] some squirrels to hunt and Jesus created
[1:04:26] three of them for brother
[1:04:30] Branham while walking through a field
[1:04:32] one day on his way to pray for a sick
[1:04:35] man brother brandham accidentally walked
[1:04:38] right up to a mean killer
[1:04:42] bull the bull was
[1:04:44] really really mad and stood up ready to
[1:04:49] charge but instead of running away
[1:04:52] brother brandham had loveed for the bull
[1:04:55] and told him that he was sorry for
[1:04:58] disturbing
[1:05:02] him then he said in the name of Jesus
[1:05:06] Christ go lay down the bull looked at
[1:05:10] him and was suddenly calm and then laid
[1:05:14] back down why Mama did that big old bull
[1:05:18] go and lay down well Junior the Bible
[1:05:21] teaches us that the most powerful thing
[1:05:23] in the world World Is Love brother
[1:05:26] branam loved the bull and that's why he
[1:05:28] laid down even big mean animals know
[1:05:32] when you love them amen so the Lord
[1:05:35] promised brother branam that he would
[1:05:37] shoot a big Silver Tip grizzly bear so
[1:05:42] he was out hunting and told all his
[1:05:44] friends about God's promise they
[1:05:47] couldn't understand because they had
[1:05:49] never seen one in that area before but
[1:05:52] they believed God anyway
[1:05:54] just before the hunt ended they saw him
[1:05:57] it was a large Silver Tip
[1:06:01] Grizzly pow the gun fired and down went
[1:06:06] the bear the Lord kept his promise amen
[1:06:12] see brother Branham loved to go to the
[1:06:14] mountains so one time a huge blizzard
[1:06:18] came and started blowing snow and the
[1:06:21] Lord told him to speak to the storm and
[1:06:24] it would go away he said storm go to
[1:06:28] your place stop and son you shine
[1:06:32] normally for 4
[1:06:35] days within a moment the Sun was shining
[1:06:38] and the clouds had
[1:06:40] disappeared mama he talked to the storm
[1:06:43] and said for it to go
[1:06:46] away yes do you remember when Joshua
[1:06:50] told the son to stand still and Moses
[1:06:53] parted theed Red
[1:06:55] Sea when we have a need we can ask
[1:06:58] anything and God will do
[1:07:01] it see on another trip on the back side
[1:07:04] of the desert the Lord sent a huge
[1:07:07] Whirlwind That Shook the ground where
[1:07:09] brother branam was standing the Rocks
[1:07:12] exploded from the side of the mountain
[1:07:13] because the worldwind was so strong and
[1:07:16] brother branham's friends were trying to
[1:07:18] get to safety from the flying rocks they
[1:07:20] didn't know what the blast meant until
[1:07:24] brother brandham told them it was God
[1:07:27] speaking to him in the
[1:07:31] Whirlwind he said it was a sign that God
[1:07:34] would judge the west
[1:07:37] coast and lastly brother Branham had a
[1:07:41] dream that he had to go on a trip in his
[1:07:45] dream he needed to store up cabbage
[1:07:48] turnips and other foods for us to eat
[1:07:51] while he was gone later brother brandham
[1:07:54] explained that the dream meant for him
[1:07:57] to record his voice on tapes so we can
[1:08:01] listen to them now amen today brother
[1:08:04] Bram sermons are translated into
[1:08:07] different languages and are sent around
[1:08:10] the world when people listen to the
[1:08:12] tapes many of them want to become
[1:08:14] Christians they learn that the happiest
[1:08:16] people in the world are people who love
[1:08:19] and serve the Lord
[1:08:22] Jesus Junior
[1:08:24] all through brother bram's life he
[1:08:26] proved that we don't need to be afraid
[1:08:29] of anything he showed us how Jesus will
[1:08:33] protect us it doesn't matter if it's a
[1:08:36] killer bull or a fierce
[1:08:39] storm God is always watching over
[1:08:44] us the same God that was with brother
[1:08:47] brandham will always protect you even
[1:08:50] during this storm night we are all
[1:08:54] children of God and through the message
