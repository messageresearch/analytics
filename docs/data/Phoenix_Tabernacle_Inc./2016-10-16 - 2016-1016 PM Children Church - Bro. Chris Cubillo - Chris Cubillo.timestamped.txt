[23:04] specials and we are so thankful to have
[23:08] the pastor that we
[23:11] have and um tonight we'll continue a
[23:16] series of exerts from the series of
[23:18] books entitled Supernatural the life of
[23:20] William brandham we're in book two we're
[23:23] starting a new chapter
[23:25] tonight and I have to read the chapter a
[23:27] certain way the words are going to sound
[23:29] a little strange but it's called the M
[23:31] Town
[23:34] Miracle a quick thought about this
[23:37] chapter we're still in the year
[23:40] 1940 the next six years will lay the
[23:42] foundation for what will
[23:45] become in many people's opinion the
[23:49] greatest soldier in the charismatic
[23:52] Revival after 1946 brother Brandon's
[23:56] Ministry went International but between
[23:58] the years of 40 and
[24:00] 46 that Ministry went from local to
[24:03] Regional to National the next five
[24:07] chapters that we will cover especially
[24:10] chapters 28 and 29 in the future are
[24:13] fundamental to the establishment of
[24:15] brother Brennan's Ministry so I just
[24:18] want to let you know that we have a lot
[24:19] of great things to come Lord
[24:22] willing and tonight we'll put on display
[24:26] another portion of brother Le brenan's
[24:40] life several weeks after the healing of
[24:43] Mrs Na's daughter William brandham was
[24:45] again spending the night at his mother's
[24:47] house even though the hour pressed late
[24:50] he couldn't seem to fall asleep so he
[24:53] got up and paced the floor of the spare
[24:55] bedroom in the dark feeling a vague
[24:58] burden tugging at his heart he thought
[25:02] maybe somebody is sick somewhere and
[25:04] needs me to pray Bill knelt by the side
[25:07] of the bed and prayed for a long time
[25:10] without any relief looking up he noticed
[25:13] a patch of white in a corner near to
[25:16] where his mother had some laundry piled
[25:18] in a chair oddly enough it seemed to be
[25:21] glowing softly when the spot of light
[25:24] moved towards him Bill knew it was the
[25:26] angel of the Lord
[25:28] it looked like a small luminescent Cloud
[25:32] the white Mist drifted into him and
[25:34] suddenly he found himself walking
[25:36] through a shadowy
[25:37] Wilderness somewhere in the distance he
[25:40] heard the bleeding of a lamb ba
[25:44] ba it sounded so
[25:47] helpless Bill said that poor little
[25:49] thing I'm going to see if I can find it
[25:52] he moved in the direction of that
[25:54] pitiful noise looking behind trees and
[25:56] under bushes for a trembling bundle of
[25:59] wool as he drew closer to the source the
[26:03] bleeding grew louder and seemed to
[26:05] change in pitch and tone until it
[26:07] sounded Almost Human Bill stopped and
[26:10] listened carefully the lamb seemed to be
[26:13] bleeding mil Town M
[26:17] Town then the vision left
[26:20] him Bill had never heard of a place
[26:22] called miltown so the next night at
[26:24] church he asked his congregation if
[26:26] anyone knew of its
[26:28] whereabouts George Wright said I do
[26:31] brother brandham it's a small town about
[26:33] 35 Mi west of here not far from where I
[26:37] live I'm going to go I'm going to go
[26:41] there next Saturday Bill explained
[26:43] somebody there is in trouble and he told
[26:45] his congregation about the vision I'll
[26:48] take you there George Wright offered
[26:51] miltown proved to be a typical rural
[26:53] Indiana Community the busiest place on
[26:55] Saturday was the grocery store in the
[26:57] middle midle of town where all the
[26:58] farmers came to do their weekly shopping
[27:01] driving down the Main Street Bill
[27:02] thought I wonder what the Lord wants of
[27:06] me since nothing better suggested itself
[27:09] he decided he would preach on the corner
[27:10] by the market going into the store he
[27:13] bought a wooden box turned it upside
[27:16] down on the street corner and stepped up
[27:18] on top Bible in hand planning to preach
[27:21] to every passer by but even though he
[27:24] had done such street corner evangelizing
[27:26] a 100 times in Jeffersonville for some
[27:29] reason now he could not think of a
[27:31] subject on which to preach it soon
[27:33] became obvious that people were not
[27:35] going to stop and listen to his
[27:36] stumbling impromptu sermons George
[27:39] Wright said brother brandham I'm going
[27:42] up on the hill to sell some eggs to a
[27:44] man I know up there do you want to ride
[27:45] up with me might as well I'm not getting
[27:49] anywhere here toward the top of the hill
[27:52] they passed a big white church Bill
[27:54] commented isn't that a lovely building
[27:57] yes George replied you know it's a Pity
[27:59] about that place it used to be a Baptist
[28:02] Church but the last Pastor there got
[28:04] into trouble the congregation all left
[28:06] and went to other churches in town and
[28:08] the city has taken over the building
[28:11] brother George why don't you stop the
[28:12] car and let me out here I feel something
[28:15] pulling me towards that church okay
[28:17] brother Bill I'll pick you up on my way
[28:20] back after the car drove away Bill
[28:23] climbed the steps and tried the door it
[28:25] was locked he sat down on on the front
[28:27] steps folded his hands bowed his head
[28:30] and prayed Lord if you want me in this
[28:33] church please unlock these doors for me
[28:37] soon a man came walking over and said
[28:39] hello I saw you sitting here and I
[28:41] wondered if I could be of some
[28:43] help well I'm a preacher Bill explained
[28:46] and I was interested in seeing this
[28:48] church but it's locked the man said I've
[28:51] got to keep thank you Lord Bill
[28:54] whispered The Stranger unlocked the
[28:56] front doors and let him through a small
[28:58] foyer into a large Sanctuary that could
[29:00] seat nearly 400 people who owns this
[29:03] building Bill asked the city does I just
[29:06] take care of it we only use it for
[29:08] weddings and funerals would it be
[29:10] possible for me to hold a Revival here
[29:13] you'll have to talk to the city
[29:14] officials about that when George Wright
[29:17] returned the two of them hunted up the
[29:19] mayor who said sure if you'll put a
[29:22] meter in it there's no electricity in
[29:24] the building now that won't be a problem
[29:27] said bill I work for the utility company
[29:28] in Jeffersonville I'll just put my own
[29:30] meter in the next Saturday morning Bill
[29:33] installed his meter in the old church
[29:35] then visited folks around the area
[29:37] telling them about the Revival meeting
[29:39] scheduled to begin that coming Wednesday
[29:40] night his first Contact was not
[29:43] promising how do you do sir my name's
[29:45] Billy Branham morning mine's Jay Mr Jay
[29:50] we're going to have a Revival meeting
[29:52] next Wednesday night at the old white
[29:53] Church on the Hill will you
[29:56] come Miss Mr Jay turned out to be a
[29:58] hardboiled egg I raised chickens I ain't
[30:02] got no time to go to no church well
[30:05] couldn't you let the chickens alone for
[30:07] a little while and come to the meetings
[30:09] Bill persisted listen fella the man
[30:12] snapped why don't you mind your own
[30:14] business and I'll take care of
[30:16] mine I didn't mean to hurt your feelings
[30:18] sir it continued like that for the rest
[30:21] of the day although most people showed
[30:23] him more courtesy than Mr Jay but
[30:25] everyone he talked to resisted the idea
[30:28] of a Revival Bill wouldn't would have
[30:30] felt discouraged except that he knew
[30:33] that he was there by the word of the
[30:34] Lord somewhere in Midtown one of God's
[30:37] Lambs was bleeding for help since the
[30:40] vision had given him only one small
[30:42] detail the name of the town Bill knew he
[30:45] would just have to keep trying until
[30:47] that needy lamb turned
[30:53] up George Wright placed a notice of the
[30:55] upcoming Revival in the local paper
[30:57] advertising his Pastor as quote unquote
[31:00] another Billy Sunday likening Bill to
[31:03] the famous baseball player turn
[31:04] revivalist who had died in
[31:07] 1935 that gimmick might have worked and
[31:09] drawn a small but curious crowd except
[31:12] that the advertisement also mentioned
[31:14] quote unquote Divine Healing and stated
[31:17] that the Reverend Billy brandham would
[31:19] pray for the sick midtown's conservative
[31:22] attitudes chilled toward such radical
[31:24] ideas that Sunday local minister advised
[31:27] their congregations to stay away from
[31:29] such foolishness the local Church of
[31:31] Christ even went so far as to threaten
[31:33] its members with excommunication if they
[31:35] dar to attend the
[31:37] Revival against such a backdrop of
[31:39] opposition it was not surprising that on
[31:42] Wednesday night only four people sat in
[31:44] the pews of the old miltown Baptist
[31:47] Church George Wright his wife his son
[31:51] and his
[31:52] daughter Bill delivered his message just
[31:55] the same as if the building had been
[31:56] full
[31:57] Thursday evening looked like it would be
[31:59] a repeat of Wednesday 5 minutes before
[32:02] the service began a man with a corn cob
[32:04] pipe in his mouth walked up the front
[32:06] steps and looked through the open doors
[32:08] noticing this man standing there George
[32:10] Wright hurried back to invite him inside
[32:13] well Mr Hall it's good to see you George
[32:15] greeted the man's hair was dished his
[32:18] clothes were dirty and he had several
[32:20] teeth missing on the side of his mouth
[32:22] he turned his corn cob pipe upside down
[32:24] and tapped it against the side of the
[32:26] building letting the ash sprinkle over
[32:27] the steps where is this little Billy
[32:30] Sunday you've been boasting about I want
[32:33] to get a look at him Mr Hall slipped
[32:36] into the first Pew as he came to it and
[32:39] he walked through the door while George
[32:40] walked up to the front to warn his
[32:43] Pastor brother Bill the hardest falling
[32:46] fellow in the country just walked in the
[32:48] door his name is William Hall he runs to
[32:51] Quarry up there on top of the hill oh
[32:53] he's a real rip
[32:55] snorter Bill sat in a chair behind the
[32:57] pulpit reading his Bible he tucked his
[33:00] bookmark in place and stood up maybe
[33:03] he's the one the Lord is after as Bill
[33:06] preached George Wright went to the back
[33:08] of the church and invited Mr Hall to
[33:09] move up closer no thanks I'll take care
[33:12] of things back here and you can take
[33:14] care of them up
[33:15] there by the time Bill finished his
[33:18] sermon Mr Hall had not only come up the
[33:21] aisle he knelt at the rail in front of
[33:23] the pulpit and cried out for God to have
[33:25] mercy on his soul
[33:27] by Friday night a new William Hall had
[33:30] coerced a dozen of his neighbors and
[33:32] employees to come with him to the
[33:33] Revival at the end of the service Bill
[33:36] offered to pray for anyone who was sick
[33:38] several people came forward and were
[33:40] healed afterwards Mr Hall said you know
[33:43] brother brandham today when I was
[33:44] talking around about the meetings and
[33:46] inviting folks I found that there is a
[33:48] girl over here that has been asking for
[33:50] you her name is Georgie Carter and she's
[33:53] got
[33:53] tuberculosis had it for years Georgie's
[33:56] almost 27 years old and if I remember
[33:59] right they say she's been bedridden for
[34:01] 9 years and 8 months she's in pretty
[34:04] rough shape now just Skin and Bones
[34:06] she's so bad they can't even raise her
[34:08] up to put a bed pan under her seems
[34:10] she's been reading a little book he
[34:12] wrote about Jesus being the same today
[34:14] as he was yesterday and she's been
[34:17] begging for you to come pray for
[34:19] her Bill's intuition told him that this
[34:21] was the bleeding lamb in the vision what
[34:24] are we waiting for let's go pray for her
[34:27] I'm afraid it's not that easy her
[34:29] parents belong to the Church of Christ
[34:31] so they don't want to have anything to
[34:32] do with you they think you're a deceiver
[34:36] in that case said bill I'll just put it
[34:38] before the Lord in prayer the healings
[34:41] took place on Friday night stirred up a
[34:44] hornet nest of debate around the
[34:46] community anger surfaced in many scoffed
[34:48] but some people were stung by Curiosity
[34:52] on Saturday night 30 new faces sat in
[34:54] the pews of the old white church and a
[34:56] dozen more healings added fuel to feed
[34:58] the fire of local
[35:00] controversy after the service Mr Hall
[35:02] brought good news to bill the Carters
[35:05] have changed their minds and will let
[35:06] you pray for their daughters tonight as
[35:08] long as neither of the parents has to be
[35:11] in
[35:11] the in the home when you come I guess
[35:15] Georgie has been crying for you so much
[35:16] that they're hoping this will satisfy
[35:19] her I suppose they had to get permission
[35:22] from their Pastor before they could let
[35:23] me come down there Bill commented anyway
[35:26] let's get going
[35:28] what Bill saw when he entered the young
[35:30] woman's room shocked him to the core of
[35:32] his sympathy over the 9 years of her
[35:35] illness Georgie Carter had wasted away
[35:37] until now she lay in bed like a skin
[35:40] covered skeleton her arms looked like
[35:42] broomsticks she could not have weighed
[35:44] more than 50 lbs on the sheet beside her
[35:47] head lay a copy of Bill's little book
[35:50] Jesus Christ the same today the same
[35:53] yesterday today and forever Georgie lips
[35:57] moved but Bill could not hear what she
[35:59] said he walked over to the bed and bent
[36:01] closer she whispered brother brandham I
[36:04] just believe that you would come and
[36:05] Jesus would let me get well sister if he
[36:09] does will you serve him with all your
[36:11] heart she nodded ever so slightly and
[36:14] repeated with all my heart then she
[36:17] coughed the nurse held a cup to
[36:19] Georgie's mouth but the poor girl was so
[36:21] weak she didn't have enough energy to
[36:23] spit to encourage her faith Bill told
[36:26] Georgie about the healing of Mrs Nail's
[36:28] daughter Georgie asked why can't you do
[36:31] for me like you did for that nail girl
[36:34] sister that was a vision I have to see
[36:37] the vision first in two weeks I'll be
[36:40] having another four days of Revival
[36:41] meetings here in miltown Maybe by then
[36:44] God will show me something more definite
[36:46] for now I can pray for you that's all I
[36:49] know if the Lord shows me something more
[36:51] I'll come back but I still believe that
[36:54] after we pray together you're going to
[36:56] get
[36:57] well when 2 weeks later the doors of the
[37:00] old mtown Baptist Church again opened

[48:38] started so if we can turn our scriptures
[48:41] to Hebrews
[48:46] 111 yeah I was you know when I was told
[48:50] if I could speak you know of course I
[48:53] took that as a as God speaking to me
[48:59] me you know and I already had something
[49:02] on my heart that I wanted to to speak to
[49:05] the
[49:09] people um but the Lord kept guiding me
[49:12] talk about this talk about
[49:17] this yeah but I was like oh Lord I need
[49:20] to talk about this you know it's been in
[49:21] my
[49:24] heart I think it was a sign after sign
[49:27] after sign the
[49:29] Lord the Lord uh he kept guiding me to
[49:32] talk about this specific
[49:36] subject and I wasn't uh I wasn't able to
[49:38] come this morning but uh I saw the
[49:40] service online in the
[49:44] morning and Brother Joseph that was
[49:52] beautiful it's going to take me an hour
[49:54] to get through this
[49:58] I took that as a well it was
[50:00] a kind of um solidified what I was going
[50:04] to be talking about
[50:09] tonight I I know this is children's
[50:11] church but
[50:12] um but I'm here it's I'm G to talk to
[50:14] the parents
[50:17] too um okay so let's get to the
[50:20] verse okay so Hebrews
[50:24] 111
[50:26] okay when you find the scripture you can
[50:28] say
[50:31] amen amen all right so Hebrews
[50:40] 111 all
[50:44] right one
[50:50] second there we go okay now Faith is the
[50:55] substance of things hoped
[50:59] for the evidence of Things Not
[51:03] Seen amen so I remember
[51:07] um reading this scripture plenty of
[51:12] times and just saying oh that's a good
[51:14] scripture cool
[51:16] cool you know and then I think now I
[51:18] think I know you want to have the
[51:21] revelation of who Jesus
[51:24] was
[51:26] that that this scripture it was I had a
[51:29] revelation of what that scripture
[51:33] meant okay so what is Faith and if I
[51:37] could
[51:38] um put a subtitle to
[51:41] it too young to have faith question
[51:45] mark okay so what is Faith No I have a
[51:48] question for the little ones if there's

[59:54] simplified for you
[59:57] guys that is Faith you know he saw the
[1:00:01] shirt and he knew that that shirt was
[1:00:06] white he didn't hope that the shirt was
[1:00:10] white he knew that the shirt was
[1:00:13] white you know and when the sister when
[1:00:15] she smelled the
[1:00:17] orange she knew the orange she knew it
[1:00:20] was an
[1:00:21] orange she knew and she you know you
[1:00:24] know no one could argue
[1:00:27] that is is is just that but it's even
[1:00:31] more it's more
[1:00:35] true okay so I'm going to read a quote
[1:00:37] from Brother Bram I wasn't able to put
[1:00:38] it on the
[1:00:41] slide okay so now Faith is a direct
[1:00:47] evidence of Things Not
[1:00:50] Seen felt taste smell
[1:00:55] or heard now look here I'm going to
[1:00:59] close my eyes now
[1:01:01] watch okay so again I just want to say
[1:01:03] again that that you know Faith again it
[1:01:06] isn't you hoping for
[1:01:10] something you know because there is a
[1:01:12] you know reading faith is a
[1:01:15] substance you know there was a
[1:01:18] story when brother
[1:01:20] Bram I I believe he went to a young
[1:01:23] girl she had a
[1:01:27] pentis and then so you know uh to make
[1:01:30] the story
[1:01:32] short so he asked her you know do you
[1:01:34] believe do you have faith that you can
[1:01:36] be
[1:01:39] healed and she said yes yes I
[1:01:41] do and and then brother bam says you
[1:01:44] think you
[1:01:47] do you think you have
[1:01:50] faith I hope that I'm smelling an orange
[1:01:57] it isn't something that we just imagine
[1:01:58] you know we hear you know we hear song
[1:02:01] after song after
[1:02:03] song and then you're like oh I got it
[1:02:05] you know I see Jesus Christ
[1:02:09] yeah you know and I'm not saying songs
[1:02:11] are bad so please
[1:02:13] don't what I'm saying is Faith is
[1:02:17] something
[1:02:19] direct you know when I find out who when
[1:02:21] I found out who the Lord
[1:02:23] was
[1:02:25] or better yet when he when when I
[1:02:28] realized that I knew that he knew who
[1:02:31] who I
[1:02:33] was because in the end it doesn't matter
[1:02:35] it's not if you know
[1:02:37] Christ do Christ know
[1:02:41] you amen hallelujah
[1:02:44] um okay uh amen um okay amen it's if
[1:02:50] does Christ know
[1:02:52] you so again so he you know brother bham
[1:02:56] asked the young um
[1:03:00] sister do you believe and she says I do
[1:03:04] believe say but brother bam says you
[1:03:07] know you think no no you don't believe
[1:03:10] you uh you you just have
[1:03:16] hope amen but faith is a
[1:03:19] substance you know there's something
[1:03:22] direct amen
[1:03:25] let me see if I find another quote
[1:03:28] here you know and well and also I was
[1:03:31] nervous back there but the reason why
[1:03:33] I'm
[1:03:36] nervous because I just want to make sure
[1:03:38] that I get the right information
[1:03:42] out I don't want to tell you children
[1:03:47] parents of the wrong
[1:03:49] thing cuz I'm going to have to stand
[1:03:52] before
[1:03:53] God and I don't want to to say my
[1:03:56] opinions I just want to read you know
[1:03:58] how brother John says I just want to
[1:03:59] read the
[1:04:02] quotes I know we're here for children's
[1:04:06] church but I I believe I have faith that
[1:04:10] you guys could get the Holy
[1:04:13] Ghost you guys aren too
[1:04:23] young
[1:04:24] all
[1:04:25] right see so again you know faith is in
[1:04:29] something so okay so brother Ram tells a
[1:04:34] sister you don't truly
[1:04:37] believe you know and then I think one
[1:04:39] thing that stumbled me
[1:04:41] was you know the sister
[1:04:44] says um you know where did that come
[1:04:47] from Faith you know is it is it of the
[1:04:51] devil or of God and then brother br says
[1:04:55] neither and you know with me when I read
[1:04:57] I was like
[1:04:59] what so um know it was a profound
[1:05:05] thing um yeah it was a very um it kind
[1:05:10] of got my mind thinking a
[1:05:15] lot yeah so um in the end it is
[1:05:19] something I remember reading also as
[1:05:21] well that there's a a gift of fa
[1:05:26] and then there's a a portion of
[1:05:28] faith and a gift of
[1:05:30] healing know and then but also there is
[1:05:34] there's
[1:05:35] also where God and the devil really
[1:05:38] isn't they're not there but the faith it
[1:05:41] it's your
[1:05:44] faith and I'm just going to read a
[1:05:46] quote so I
[1:05:51] said
[1:05:53] okay
[1:05:55] so it says I said one day Jesus passed
[1:05:57] by a
[1:06:00] tree he wanted to find some fruit on
[1:06:04] it there was no fruit on it he put a
[1:06:07] curse on
[1:06:08] it and the tree began to
[1:06:13] wilt and when they passed by at noon the
[1:06:16] tree was wilting
[1:06:21] down amen and Peter remarked and said
[1:06:23] how quick the tree was
[1:06:28] wilted and this is where my mind was
[1:06:30] like
[1:06:32] wow you know I've read it
[1:06:35] before but just for some reason there
[1:06:37] was like a revelation of what that
[1:06:40] meant he said if you if you would say in
[1:06:43] your
[1:06:45] heart for this tree to be plugged
[1:06:50] up and cast into the sea and wouldn't
[1:06:54] doubt it it would obey
[1:06:57] you did he say it and I said he said if
[1:07:02] you say to this
[1:07:05] mountain be moved and doubt it not in
[1:07:08] your
[1:07:09] heart by and by it would come to
[1:07:13] pass and here's the awesome part cuz
[1:07:17] I I've heard this part too you
[1:07:20] know you know other people kind of say
[1:07:22] this so did he say
[1:07:25] sure he
[1:07:26] did I
[1:07:28] said I know your unbelieving
[1:07:32] pastor trying to justify his
[1:07:36] unbelief said that was a mountain of
[1:07:40] sin I went to school
[1:07:42] myself he was kneeling by Mount
[1:07:46] olives it was Mount of
[1:07:49] Olives if you say in your heart for it
[1:07:51] to be
[1:07:52] moved
[1:07:54] and don't doubt it I said how much more
[1:07:58] faith and he said if you had Faith size
[1:08:01] of a mustard
[1:08:04] seed I said
[1:08:06] now if the faith is size of a mustard
[1:08:11] seed
[1:08:13] how she would move that
[1:08:17] mountain how much more smaller Faith
[1:08:20] would you have to to have just to move
[1:08:22] that bracelet
[1:08:27] so when brother Brown was talking to
[1:08:29] that
[1:08:32] sister yeah he told her if you have
[1:08:34] faith move that bracelet Hanging On A
[1:08:39] String you know and she was like well
[1:08:42] that's
[1:08:44] spiritualism and again brother Bram knew
[1:08:46] that she was going to say that and
[1:08:47] that's
[1:08:51] where and then he gives us example of
[1:08:53] the
[1:08:55] tree being rooted
[1:08:57] up cast into the
[1:09:00] sea amen and that's it's not a it's real
[1:09:05] if you have the
[1:09:07] faith to move
[1:09:10] mountains if you see Mount Everest say
[1:09:12] you know I have faith that this mountain
[1:09:14] is going to be cast into the
[1:09:17] sea that's real you know we we serve a
[1:09:21] living
[1:09:22] God amen hallelujah
[1:09:26] sorry but God is
[1:09:29] real it isn't something and and I want
[1:09:32] to bring it back
[1:09:34] to to the children or if anyone doesn't
[1:09:37] know the Lord Jesus
[1:09:40] Christ it isn't I I I I hope Jesus died
[1:09:43] for
[1:09:46] me I hope my sins are
[1:09:51] covered knowing
[1:09:54] that Jesus Christ died for
[1:09:56] you and all you everybody
[1:10:03] here all right and uh obviously we're in
[1:10:06] children's
[1:10:08] church so I want to obviously I'm trying
[1:10:11] to direct to the parents or talk to the
[1:10:13] parents and the
[1:10:16] children you know and I'm talking like
[1:10:17] this because I know you guys understand
[1:10:19] me the children I know you guys
[1:10:22] do I remember when my mind you know when
[1:10:25] I was a younger
[1:10:27] child you know I remember thinking just
[1:10:30] thoughts you know why need to get
[1:10:34] married you know and obviously I didn't
[1:10:36] know you know you have to have a job you
[1:10:37] have to have
[1:10:40] this but the thing is I wanted to get
[1:10:44] married and that's where why
[1:10:48] parents we need to talk about that with
[1:10:50] our children we need to tell them that
[1:10:53] you need to be born
[1:10:56] again that you both have to have the
[1:10:58] Holy
[1:10:59] Ghost you don't go testing girls
[1:11:03] around I'm preaching to myself too
[1:11:07] okay that God will
[1:11:15] provide or a a woman for you
[1:11:19] guys no God is real you know train your
[1:11:23] children that hey have faith God will
[1:11:25] send your
[1:11:29] husband you know adah he already is
[1:11:31] talking about his wife and her
[1:11:34] name and that's where we need to get
[1:11:37] in because if you don't teach him
[1:11:40] someone else is going to teach him in
[1:11:42] the
[1:11:43] world that's not going to be a good
[1:11:45] thing it's going to be a very bad
[1:11:48] thing and again I don't believe you guys

[1:23:15] see and he said I'll be I'll be
[1:23:19] listening and you seen the voice of
[1:23:21] healing
[1:23:23] here recently what he
[1:23:26] apologized you know so the man was
[1:23:28] apologizing to brother
[1:23:31] brand and now he's praying for the sick
[1:23:33] himself
[1:23:35] now so that he
[1:23:37] said if I hadn't been so
[1:23:40] backsliding I'd have listened to that

[1:24:06] against me you know I'm sorry for
[1:24:08] anything I've

[1:24:14] a living
[1:24:16] God and that may I I I I may sound
[1:24:19] redundant or I've said that a bunch of
[1:24:21] times

[1:24:27] that maybe it hasn't clicked

[1:25:26] do we need to examine ourselves look at
[1:25:28] our
[1:25:30] lives you know let's just be real with
[1:25:33] ourselves am I in the word or am I

[1:25:56] you I said you're right a Christian
[1:25:59] wouldn't say
[1:26:01] that I was convicted in my
[1:26:04] heart so let's examine
[1:26:07] ourselves you know let's just be real
[1:26:09] with
[1:26:10] ourselves if if you see that you're not
[1:26:13] in the word you
[1:26:14] know you know just stop fooling yourself
[1:26:16] I don't have Jesus or I I I do have
[1:26:18] Jesus and I'm talking to
[1:26:20] myself cuz for 4 years
[1:26:23] I was deceiving
[1:26:25] myself I was going
[1:26:28] crazy I was being attacked left and
[1:26:31] right
[1:26:33] by
[1:26:34] Sude all this crazy stuff you
[1:26:38] know and I had to examine myself you
[1:26:40] know come on Chris be
[1:26:44] real you know there's two
[1:26:47] destinations you know there is a God but
[1:26:49] there's a devil and he's real
[1:26:52] and I'm telling you kids he's there to
[1:26:54] kill you
[1:26:56] guys you know he's not here to flick
[1:26:59] you or even punch you if he wants to
[1:27:03] kill you and I'm not here to scare
[1:27:07] anybody the thing is there's also God
[1:27:10] and Jesus
[1:27:12] Christ and he's real and we already won
[1:27:15] the Battle of the
[1:27:18] war it's over so again this
[1:27:23] just be honest with
[1:27:25] yourself because I love you guys I know
[1:27:27] I'm going to see every single one of you
[1:27:29] in the wedding supper I'm not going to
[1:27:30] go for foolish version I'm going to be

[1:27:38] Bride
[1:27:40] amen
[1:27:42] well forgive me again anything wrong
[1:27:46] I've
[1:27:47] said but my time's almost up but
[1:27:51] have about about 50 seconds
[1:27:54] left so I just want to keep telling you
[1:27:56] that Jesus loves
[1:27:59] you he loves you he loves you and don't
[1:28:04] ever say Jesus doesn't love me I don't
[1:28:06] see him in my
[1:28:08] life he's working in there he's working
[1:28:12] he's
[1:28:13] working and with With God all all things
[1:28:16] are
[1:28:18] possible you know I've come to
[1:28:19] realization that the Christian Life is a
[1:28:21] easy e
[1:28:25] life some people say whoa he's not a
[1:28:30] Christian but thing is reading that we
[1:28:32] have come into the peace into his rest
[1:28:35] we've come into his
[1:28:38] rest and I realize that it becomes
[1:28:42] hard when we stop
[1:28:44] believing that's it it's only
[1:28:47] believe just believing in Jesus Christ
