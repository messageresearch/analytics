[41:29] the word
[41:30] we ask you these things in the name of
[41:32] the lord jesus christ we pray amen
[41:37] before i read the scripture i want to
[41:38] make just one quick comment and that is
[41:40] that
[41:41] as i said to you last time
[41:44] my focus from now on in my ministry is
[41:47] not to try to bring anything new nothing
[41:49] outstanding is just to be
[41:52] provoke each one like the scripture says
[41:54] encourage one another with these words
[41:56] for you to go into the message and study
[41:59] the message more that's all that's
[42:01] that's my from now now it's going to be
[42:03] my entire goal and i'm going to be
[42:05] focusing on the young people
[42:07] and
[42:08] because of one one main reason i hate
[42:12] what satan is doing to the young people
[42:14] educationally right now they're they're
[42:16] stealing our books their uh sister how
[42:19] many of you teachers here no they're
[42:21] taking things out of our history books
[42:23] raise your hand you teachers raise your
[42:24] hand there's a teacher back there any
[42:26] other teachers we have here this morning
[42:30] yes thank you
[42:31] you know you know they're taking things
[42:32] from our history we're gonna we're gonna
[42:34] see that uh we saw that sunday night
[42:36] those of you that were here since 1934
[42:39] they're no longer talk about
[42:41] the miraculous savings uh how god
[42:43] miraculously saved how many were here
[42:45] sunday night raise your hand
[42:47] say amen if you learned a little bit
[42:49] something about george washington
[42:50] yeah we we learned that since 1934 they
[42:53] no longer put that part in there where
[42:55] those bullets went through him
[42:57] that's been taken out 1934 80 years ago
[43:00] they took that out of there so i'm angry
[43:02] at satan
[43:04] and i'm angry at his bride
[43:07] you know who she is right if i say it
[43:09] i'm going to start saying some bad words
[43:10] to some of you and you're going to be
[43:11] scandalized and i don't want to say that
[43:13] i'm angry at the rcc
[43:19] because she is
[43:21] satan's agent on earth
[43:23] and she's been attacking the united
[43:25] states in
[43:26] 1770 something
[43:29] and actually we want to look at it since
[43:31] 1620
[43:33] that scripture told brother man told us
[43:35] last week
[43:36] or the first the sec second
[43:39] birth pains number two
[43:41] when we talked about
[43:42] the compound fulfillment of the
[43:44] scripture how many remember that
[43:46] that she fled to the wilderness was with
[43:49] she had twins of an eagle
[43:51] so
[43:52] when did the pilgrims come to america
[43:54] 1620
[43:57] and in the sardis age
[44:01] god did a little
[44:02] maneuvering under satan's nose
[44:06] but she's been after them since since
[44:08] then
[44:09] that's another study altogether which
[44:11] we'll get to that maybe next year
[44:13] on jezebel religion
[44:15] and you'll understand why i'm angry at
[44:17] that
[44:18] and i'll give you just two little
[44:20] pointers one of them is they're
[44:21] attacking george washington that that he
[44:23] is not a christian
[44:25] in our history books and number two
[44:27] they're starting to call it
[44:29] and this i hope i don't lose it
[44:31] because i love that man
[44:33] love my heart
[44:34] abraham lincoln
[44:36] now they're saying in their history
[44:38] books that he was a homosexual
[44:40] that's what they're teaching your
[44:41] children brothers and sisters
[44:44] parents open up your eyes and your ears
[44:47] for the scripture says he that has an
[44:49] ear to hear let him hear what the spirit
[44:52] speaks unto the church
[44:54] now brother ernie it's right there in
[44:56] our message
[44:59] i'm angry
[45:01] at what they're doing to america
[45:04] i'm angry for those that hate america
[45:10] because israel
[45:11] america the united states parallels
[45:14] israel
[45:16] and when you hate america
[45:19] god's country i'll say it like that you
[45:22] are hating
[45:23] israel it's parallel
[45:26] i wasn't going to say all this i need to
[45:28] shut my mouth
[45:30] because i'm limited on time
[45:32] so let's just get to this see we have
[45:35] i wanted to finish birth pains in one
[45:38] setting one talk i said wow i can't do
[45:40] that i need two nope need three i can't
[45:43] go any further
[45:44] so i'm going to go into read the
[45:46] scripture
[45:48] and i'm going to go through the this is
[45:49] going to be a sunday school lesson let's
[45:50] read the scripture and then you can see
[45:52] you may be seated i apologize for
[45:53] keeping you standing and thank you for
[45:55] the music or we're done thank you very
[45:57] much i love that song to be like jesus
[46:00] if you can forget about your job forget
[46:02] about your car forget about your
[46:04] whatever forget about your this that
[46:07] forget about everything uh brother
[46:09] branham said this and
[46:11] in god's power to transform in prescott
[46:13] arizona he said the most important thing
[46:16] in life is to get ready to meet god
[46:20] that's the most important thing in in
[46:22] life
[46:23] get ready to meet god
[46:25] he will not accept anything i accept the
[46:27] blood of the lord jesus christ i want to
[46:29] be under the blood
[46:32] i don't care what's happening around me
[46:34] i want to be under the blood
[46:37] praise god
[46:38] verily verily i say to you that you
[46:41] shall weep and lament but the world
[46:43] shall rejoice and you shall be sorrowful
[46:46] but your sorrow shall be turned to into
[46:49] joy thank you lord
[46:50] a woman when she is in travail has
[46:52] sorrow because her hour has come but as
[46:55] soon as she's delivered of the child she
[46:57] remembers no more the anguish for joy
[47:00] that a man or child is born into the
[47:03] world you may be seated
[47:06] jesus here brother baby tells us
[47:10] speaking here as he said you will have
[47:11] sorrow but your sorrow shall be turned
[47:13] to joy speaking of his disciples here
[47:15] knowing that the birth of christianity
[47:18] was coming into existence and now the
[47:20] old has to die in order that the newest
[47:24] born
[47:25] have anything that gives birth has to
[47:27] have pains of distress
[47:30] now we have i want like i said i wanted
[47:31] to do talk bring it into three group
[47:33] into three talks
[47:35] introduction and and the work pains that
[47:38] the world goes through
[47:39] number two the birth pains that israel
[47:41] had to produce the lord jesus christ
[47:43] eventually
[47:45] and the church ages that the church ages
[47:47] had in order to eventually produce the
[47:49] son of man
[47:51] and then this age and the individual
[47:54] this age has birth pains
[47:56] and then the church the the bride itself
[47:59] has birth pains to produce the bride
[48:02] itself the lord jesus christ
[48:05] in each and every one of the believers
[48:07] even with each member of the bride
[48:11] then the individual will have birth
[48:13] pains as it transitions from this old
[48:17] stinky filthy pest house into its new
[48:20] body
[48:21] woo
[48:23] that is beautiful
[48:25] now
[48:27] uh see that was your three goals now the
[48:29] first in birth pain is number one we
[48:32] learned the following as far as the
[48:34] world producing a new world there will
[48:37] be a new avenue a new a new heaven and
[48:39] new earth
[48:40] that it has to go through birth pains
[48:43] and it's going to hit has to go through
[48:45] birth pains just to be able to clean up
[48:47] the earth a little bit
[48:49] for the millennium to take place does
[48:51] that make sense
[48:52] then it has to go through another birth
[48:54] pains and burning up for it for for it
[48:56] to be a fit place as brother man said
[48:58] for heaven to come down here on earth
[49:01] for the new jerusalem to come down
[49:04] okay
[49:05] and uh so the
[49:07] birth pain
[49:08] number one was world war one
[49:11] you can see it reverse the world war ii
[49:14] was another birth pain that's what we
[49:16] learned the first time
[49:18] and then the brother man said it cannot
[49:20] take a third birth pain
[49:22] it'll throw it out into space he said
[49:25] can't take it
[49:27] it's
[49:28] the third world war is what's going to
[49:30] bring things to
[49:32] a battle uh conclusion
[49:35] and one of them that's horrible
[49:37] is just a battle of armageddon i don't
[49:40] have a brother
[49:41] theologian brother of mine that's he
[49:43] talks about the war of armageddon yeah
[49:46] it is the war of armageddon
[49:48] and there's a con there's a battle of
[49:50] armageddon
[49:53] and there's a war of megiddo
[49:56] tapped off by the battle of megiddo does
[50:00] this make sense to you
[50:01] kind of sort of
[50:03] if not then you can go back and listen
[50:05] to you don't want to listen to me listen
[50:07] to what the pope says listen to these
[50:08] other guys they're saying hey it sounds
[50:10] like world war three is already started
[50:12] is that right how many of you heard them
[50:14] say that already
[50:15] so so um
[50:17] anyway so that's that's what we learned
[50:19] in the world in
[50:20] birth pain number one birth pain number
[50:22] two
[50:23] we learned the following that every
[50:24] scripture
[50:25] and prophecy
[50:28] most all of it has a compound or
[50:30] multiple meaning
[50:32] israel and then brother also we learned
[50:34] that number two last time is that israel
[50:37] had seven church
[50:38] ages two and typed exactly not almost
[50:44] not kind of sort of
[50:46] exactly with these it's it's history
[50:50] repeating itself
[50:56] and we found out that in thyatira if you
[50:58] want to go to what i'm saying these
[51:00] comments go to go to revelations chapter
[51:02] 2
[51:04] verse 20. i think it is somewhere in
[51:06] there
[51:08] we learned in that in thyatira
[51:11] god raised up a virgin just just
[51:13] starting to eat just
[51:14] talking just very lit very very simply
[51:17] and comparing jezebel and that's the
[51:20] next study i want to get into when i
[51:23] talk about abraham lincoln and and
[51:25] george washington
[51:26] it's the title of the study is going to
[51:28] be just about religion
[51:31] okay
[51:32] and i don't want to get into that
[51:33] because it's
[51:35] we'll be losing time here but i just
[51:37] showed that that in the time of elijah
[51:40] they had a jezebel and an ahab on the
[51:42] throne is that right
[51:44] and she was the really run she really
[51:46] was the one that ran the show
[51:48] that's what brother brown said she was
[51:50] the one that was the head behind the
[51:51] head so to speak
[51:53] and uh but at that time over there in in
[51:57] in
[51:58] israel over here in the ant the antitype
[52:04] is the church you have a jezebel on the
[52:06] throne also during tyra is that right
[52:09] how many of you studied that some church
[52:10] agents can say amen to they know that's
[52:12] true
[52:13] some of you know that that's good all
[52:15] right
[52:16] and so here's what we're in tyra let's
[52:18] let let's look at that together you can
[52:19] look up here read with me it's silent if
[52:21] you want if you want to read our lives
[52:22] you can if you want to and thyatira god
[52:25] raised up a virgin
[52:27] a prophetess to fight the great harlot
[52:30] that's jezebel the false prophetess the
[52:32] maiden was joan of ark now let's look at
[52:35] the scripture i'll read it from the
[52:36] scripture maybe a little bit different
[52:38] than what's there because i'm reading
[52:39] from the
[52:40] um
[52:41] the newer king james what it's called
[52:44] easy reading something like that easy
[52:45] reading king james
[52:47] it says that and
[52:49] he's uh revelation 22 20
[52:53] says the following notwithstanding i
[52:55] have a few things against you because
[52:56] you permit that woman jezebel which
[52:59] calls herself a prophetess to teach and
[53:02] to seduce my servants to commit
[53:04] fornication and to eating sacrifice to
[53:06] idols
[53:08] isn't that incredible
[53:09] not beautiful
[53:10] they type exactly these and we're going
[53:12] to see that a little bit i can talk
[53:13] about that later
[53:14] and and and just for you to understand
[53:17] and you can't see it here
[53:19] because of the
[53:21] uh
[53:22] the way it's blowing up here on this on
[53:23] the screen
[53:24] i have these these uh the scripture
[53:27] that's my fault huh yes it is it's my
[53:29] fault
[53:32] you we see here that uh
[53:35] thyatira which read the scripture the
[53:38] thyatira
[53:39] brother brahm tells us in the exposition
[53:41] of seven church churches that thyatira
[53:42] means dominating female
[53:46] and when he preaches the seven church
[53:48] ages in the revelation jesus christ book
[53:50] he says that thyatira means laxed loose
[53:53] or hazy like you know you can't make it
[53:55] out it's really kind of
[53:58] diatoma also means odor of affliction
[54:02] that's the strongest concordance
[54:04] and then other theologians say it means
[54:07] semi-ramas and if it doesn't mean
[54:08] anything to you then all you have to do
[54:10] is go read the title of how many raise
[54:13] your hand have you ever heard brother
[54:14] brad mentioned his slaps two babylons
[54:16] raise your hand nice and high
[54:18] okay in there brother branham says
[54:22] that the
[54:23] uh in his slop dr histop entitles it to
[54:26] babylons
[54:28] or the subtitle is
[54:31] uh
[54:32] the papacy
[54:34] proven to be the worship
[54:38] of nimrod
[54:39] and his wife
[54:41] and what was his wife's name sammy ramis
[54:44] she was both his mother and his wife
[54:47] that's perversion brother ernie yeah
[54:49] that's what it is that's what the papacy
[54:51] is
[54:52] brother ernie aren't you ashamed too
[54:54] afraid to speak like that behind the
[54:55] pulpit
[54:56] no
[54:59] what can they do is shoot me
[55:02] so let him shoot me
[55:05] i'd love that my brother man i'd love to
[55:07] be standing behind the pope and i'd love
[55:08] to go in the pulpit
[55:13] but one of the one of these theologians
[55:16] on the on the internet they bring all
[55:18] these things out they said no what it
[55:19] really means
[55:20] tyra really means is semiramis the wife
[55:23] of nimrod i go yes
[55:26] thank you it's all tied together
[55:29] okay
[55:30] now you say out of brother ernie i don't
[55:32] understand a word you're saying well
[55:34] that's what i'm encouraging you to do go
[55:36] study
[55:38] go read his slops two babylons brother
[55:40] benue said read islam's two babylonians
[55:43] you'll get great light
[55:45] that's what he said read his love's too
[55:48] bad i'm not mad at you
[55:50] i'm not mad i'm gonna take the stops i
[55:52] cool down
[55:53] i'm not mad at you i'm just saying what
[55:55] he said he said re i'll say it calmly
[55:57] like he said it read his steps to
[55:58] babylon's you'll get great light
[56:01] so if you want to get great light go
[56:02] read histograms is it going to be
[56:04] overnight reading no it's going to take
[56:06] you a few weeks to get through it
[56:08] maybe a couple months
[56:12] okay
[56:16] now let's let's get into um i'm not sure
[56:18] how we got that far but let's let's go
[56:20] back to uh
[56:24] i have to look around for this because
[56:26] this is
[56:27] seems like something's out of border out
[56:29] of sequence
[56:36] well i'm looking for scissors there's
[56:37] three stages of journey let's go there
[56:45] not sure
[56:50] brother you can help me back there
[56:51] there's a there's a slide on my
[56:53] numbering
[56:54] um
[56:56] well we just read that let's go back to
[56:57] that scripture
[57:01] i'll do it i'll do it from here brother
[57:09] you're getting a good uh
[57:11] review of what i'm i'm
[57:13] here we go
[57:14] um
[57:16] on the next slide you're gonna see that
[57:19] we have we learned we're still get we're
[57:21] still barely uh
[57:23] reviewing
[57:24] let's go to the next one we're
[57:26] really now barely reviewing
[57:30] let's go to the four
[57:32] foundations brother
[57:34] i think we're fighting each other right
[57:35] now
[57:37] okay we we learned last
[57:41] bp two on birth pains number two we also
[57:44] those of you that were here remember
[57:45] that brother bam said that there were
[57:46] four foundations remember that
[57:48] that was when he was building the the
[57:50] masterpiece
[57:52] it's not my title that's another message
[57:54] you need to go study the masterpiece
[57:56] can't say everything in one time just in
[57:58] three minutes one minute
[58:00] but when when when brother madam is when
[58:03] the lord jesus christ when god
[58:06] is starting off with israel to produce
[58:08] the great masterpiece which is the head
[58:11] stone jesus christ
[58:13] he has to start off with the foundation
[58:15] for his great masterpiece and brother
[58:17] bravo said that that every masterpiece
[58:20] is just set up on on a foundation
[58:23] and he said that the foundation were the
[58:25] patriarchs and these are the four
[58:27] patriarchs abraham
[58:28] was faith brotherhood said isaac was
[58:30] love
[58:31] jacob was grace joseph was perfection
[58:34] now if you want to look at it from
[58:36] another point of view also remember
[58:38] brother ban said every prophecy every
[58:40] scripture has a compound fulfillment if
[58:43] you want to look at it from the
[58:44] standpoint of when god appears to moses
[58:47] god appears to moses and he said who are
[58:49] you
[58:51] and he says i am the god of abraham
[58:53] isaac and jacob you want to stay just
[58:56] with that he said i am the god of faith
[58:59] love and grace
[59:01] okay
[59:02] but let's look at it from this other
[59:04] perspective
[59:05] let's look it from
[59:07] jesus's first doctrine
[59:10] okay jesus first doctrine was the new
[59:12] birth is that right
[59:13] so he's saying i am the god of
[59:16] justification
[59:18] sanctification
[59:20] and then your birth
[59:22] and then the perfection
[59:24] doesn't mention joseph he says i'm just
[59:26] god of the i am the god of the new birth
[59:29] you want to look at it like that
[59:31] okay
[59:32] but it has to be a foundation and
[59:35] there's a foundation that he that he
[59:36] sets up
[59:37] then the next thing we see
[59:39] is uh the foundation this is the mask
[59:43] this is the
[59:44] masterpiece god's building
[59:48] through seven church ages
[59:50] to israel say israel
[59:53] so okay thank you
[59:55] so he's building up israel
[59:59] through uh
[1:00:01] seven
[1:00:02] church ages is that right
[1:00:04] israel has seven churches raise your
[1:00:06] hand if you remember we said that that
[1:00:07] brother bradley said that okay he has
[1:00:09] seven churches so they haven't said they
[1:00:10] have seven church ages but he has to
[1:00:12] have a foundation for that masterpiece
[1:00:16] for the head jesus to come down
[1:00:20] you can see how beautiful it is in a
[1:00:21] little bit it's just they they type
[1:00:23] perfectly okay
[1:00:25] so that's the
[1:00:27] the masterpiece
[1:00:29] and today's goal i want you i want you i
[1:00:31] want to do it over here on this side
[1:00:33] today's goal if i can do it this way
[1:00:35] today's goal is to finish number two
[1:00:37] because we didn't finish number two last
[1:00:38] time
[1:00:39] and talk about the birth page that
[1:00:41] israel has and the seven church ages had
[1:00:44] then we're going to get into the birth
[1:00:46] pains number three
[1:00:48] this age and the individual and i can
[1:00:50] say here today's goal finished two and
[1:00:52] three this is our last talk on bp3 if i
[1:00:54] don't finish number three sorry
[1:00:56] i'm sorry well
[1:00:58] i'll lose i'll let loose some things
[1:01:00] here and there next year
[1:01:02] remember i spoke on birth pains this is
[1:01:04] another part of that and
[1:01:06] if it fits okay
[1:01:08] but
[1:01:10] that's our goal okay um and so now we
[1:01:12] come up to here
[1:01:15] that if you remember in the in the
[1:01:17] pyramid you just saw there's the
[1:01:19] foundation exactly is that correct uh
[1:01:21] four patriarchs you have abraham isaac
[1:01:23] and jacob
[1:01:24] and joseph
[1:01:26] jacob and joseph go to is to egypt is
[1:01:29] that correct
[1:01:31] yes or no
[1:01:32] this is joseph is in charge he's a big
[1:01:34] he's he's the big guy in charge of and
[1:01:37] he brings jacob to him right and then he
[1:01:39] tells him hey guys when you leave here
[1:01:41] make sure you take my mummy with you you
[1:01:43] know take me with you i want to i want
[1:01:45] to be buried over there in palestine
[1:01:46] where the resurrection is going to be
[1:01:48] where the rapture is going to be
[1:01:50] you know
[1:01:52] and so
[1:01:53] uh here's
[1:01:54] here's
[1:01:56] so so you can see that israel also had a
[1:02:00] foundation
[1:02:01] foundation of the apostle of the
[1:02:03] patriarchs
[1:02:05] then they have their justification
[1:02:06] sanctification
[1:02:08] and new birth also
[1:02:10] all right so let's read that right now
[1:02:12] let's read read along with me please
[1:02:14] there's there's three stages to their
[1:02:15] journey of their journey they left egypt
[1:02:19] justification believe in the word they
[1:02:22] separated themselves from the egyptians
[1:02:24] and came and come out they cross the red
[1:02:26] sea that's the blood and kill the things
[1:02:28] behind me which was sanctification
[1:02:30] through the
[1:02:31] blood that kills all human desires of
[1:02:34] evil the second stage of the journey but
[1:02:37] the third stage was when they crossed
[1:02:40] jordan isn't that beautiful
[1:02:43] what is jordan it's death is that right
[1:02:45] i don't want to appreciate it but that's
[1:02:47] death is that right when did it cross it
[1:02:49] when it was the most impossible it was
[1:02:51] in april which is a new year yes or no
[1:02:55] this
[1:02:56] shall be the new month of years to you
[1:02:58] nissan april
[1:03:01] brother man said it was just flooded
[1:03:03] over
[1:03:05] snow is melting up at mount hermon
[1:03:08] the top
[1:03:09] how mount hermann
[1:03:11] the jordan river starts to flow
[1:03:14] and this southerly flow
[1:03:18] but then where does it go
[1:03:21] it starts
[1:03:23] christmas being heads to
[1:03:26] the galilee
[1:03:28] in galilee then then the flood goes then
[1:03:32] it fills the red sea
[1:03:34] it can't go any further south
[1:03:37] it can't go any further south
[1:03:40] the dead sea is its mouth
[1:03:43] the dead sea is a smile you wanna you
[1:03:45] want a confirmation that
[1:03:46] jordan is death
[1:03:48] where does the flow hoarders that
[1:03:50] eventually end up in
[1:03:52] the dead sea
[1:03:54] it's the lowest river in the world
[1:03:57] i sang that song but
[1:03:59] i'm not complaining brothers i sang that
[1:04:01] song the lord gave it to me very few
[1:04:03] people understood it okay
[1:04:20] but the third stage when they cross
[1:04:22] jordan into the promised land
[1:04:32] in to the promised land this is the
[1:04:35] promised land
[1:04:38] the land flowing with milk and honey
[1:04:41] the holy spirit
[1:04:43] here on earth then the holy spirit comes
[1:04:44] down and encapsulates that it
[1:04:47] caps it off
[1:04:52] now as far as like i said before
[1:04:56] here's the masterpiece
[1:04:59] everybody agree with me
[1:05:02] this is what brother branham how brother
[1:05:03] banham said preached it
[1:05:05] he said they had the foundations of the
[1:05:07] patriarchs is that correct
[1:05:09] and then he said that the body and that
[1:05:10] message the masterpiece says the body
[1:05:13] comprise or make up
[1:05:16] the the body of this masterpiece
[1:05:20] was made up by the prophets the body
[1:05:23] but then what was the head
[1:05:25] the lord jesus christ okay
[1:05:27] which is a beautiful thing but in here
[1:05:31] right in here you got justification
[1:05:34] sanctification
[1:05:36] and and the new birth taking you into
[1:05:38] here's where now you're in the new the
[1:05:40] new land canaan land the land of promise
[1:05:43] where their inheritance laid if i
[1:05:46] that's what it says they go into the
[1:05:48] promised land where their inheritance
[1:05:50] laid
[1:05:52] some of you say dog brother and you got
[1:05:54] it all turned around no
[1:05:56] israel is born as a
[1:05:58] as a church when it comes out of egypt
[1:06:02] ecclesia called out is that correct how
[1:06:06] many you know brother man said church
[1:06:07] means called out raise your hand
[1:06:09] church means called out when were they
[1:06:11] called out when they were called out of
[1:06:13] egypt what did they become a church a
[1:06:16] wandering church
[1:06:20] i was going to sing a special they might
[1:06:21] as well sing it to you
[1:06:23] the the chorus anyway
[1:06:28] the bride is going
[1:06:31] to their heavenly home
[1:06:35] never
[1:06:36] more to like pilgrims roam
[1:06:41] that's what they were doing pilgrims
[1:06:42] roaming over this way enough let's go
[1:06:44] this way pillar fire go there good 40
[1:06:46] years in the wilderness because of their
[1:06:48] disobedience they could have done it in
[1:06:50] 30 days or something like that
[1:06:54] that's that's where we're at so that's
[1:06:55] the that's the masterpiece
[1:07:00] now i'd like to say this brother says
[1:07:02] i'd like to say this that this is
[1:07:04] beautiful it starts it starts getting
[1:07:05] gooder and gooder this is i'd like to
[1:07:07] say this that this book of ephesians
[1:07:09] perfectly parallels the old testament
[1:07:12] joshua ephesians the book of ephesians
[1:07:16] now if you look at
[1:07:18] the new the new
[1:07:20] uh what it called the new title
[1:07:23] everybody read with me here what is the
[1:07:24] title here
[1:07:25] adoption number one what was its
[1:07:27] original title
[1:07:29] ephesians parallels joshua that
[1:07:33] beautiful
[1:07:34] those of you that are that are comparing
[1:07:36] already in your mind the the two church
[1:07:39] ate the two pyramids israel seminar
[1:07:42] changes and if you're there
[1:07:44] and the seven church ages for the
[1:07:46] gentile church if you're already
[1:07:47] paralleling them in your mind
[1:07:49] that that's what i'm talking to right
[1:07:50] now and if you're not start thinking
[1:07:52] about that start keeping the two in your
[1:07:54] mind okay
[1:07:57] another thing he says about about joshua
[1:07:59] in ephesians
[1:08:01] this is in paradox 1965 he says i think
[1:08:04] this book of joshua
[1:08:08] did i read the other one entirely let me
[1:08:09] go back to that so i can read it at
[1:08:11] least i'd like to say this that this
[1:08:13] book of ephesians perfectly parallels
[1:08:16] the old testament joshua
[1:08:18] ephesians the book of ephesians
[1:08:21] and then in 65 that's in 1960.
[1:08:26] in 1965 brother man says i think this
[1:08:28] book of joshua fits
[1:08:30] a fitting word for it would be the book
[1:08:34] of ephesians of the old testament
[1:08:38] the book of ephesians of the old
[1:08:40] testament would be a good thing to title
[1:08:42] this book of joshua
[1:08:44] because it's certainly fitting to this
[1:08:48] to what
[1:08:50] okay let's see what he says continue
[1:08:52] so ephesians back to adoption number one
[1:08:55] so ephesians here sets up like joshua
[1:08:57] positionally you notice joshua after
[1:09:00] crossing the jordan
[1:09:03] he divided the
[1:09:04] land each of those hebrew mothers giving
[1:09:08] birth to those children
[1:09:10] she spoke the very place in her labor
[1:09:13] pains where they would be positioned in
[1:09:15] the promised land oh it's a great study
[1:09:20] simeon
[1:09:22] simeone
[1:09:23] oh simeon what hearing you heard me god
[1:09:27] you heard my cry
[1:09:28] and you gave me another child
[1:09:30] i don't know if it's dan or one of them
[1:09:32] said oh man oh this is a hard one feels
[1:09:35] like an army i feel like i'm giving
[1:09:37] birth to an army so she names him
[1:09:40] that name uh not dan that means judgment
[1:09:42] but i think maybe dan i don't know which
[1:09:44] one it is one of them is like an army
[1:09:46] the names
[1:09:47] each name meant something
[1:09:50] okay
[1:09:52] it's oh she said uh let's finish reading
[1:09:54] that
[1:09:56] she spoke the very place in her labor
[1:09:58] pains where they would be positioned in
[1:10:01] the promised land oh it's a great study
[1:10:04] so i present it to you
[1:10:06] study it out
[1:10:08] study what the names of the twelve
[1:10:10] patriarchs are
[1:10:11] studying for a brother basis bro i could
[1:10:13] take you right for joseph he says i
[1:10:15] could take you joseph and show you
[1:10:17] exactly where it is in the united states
[1:10:20] wow i i've looked i can't find it yet
[1:10:22] i'll find this on me
[1:10:24] if the lord if it's in the message i'll
[1:10:26] find i gotta find the rebel tim is there
[1:10:29] he says in ephraim i think it's ephraim
[1:10:31] where he has his feet dipped in oil
[1:10:34] all you have to do is find out where
[1:10:36] ephraim is start drinking drink drilling
[1:10:38] there
[1:10:39] except they're you know they're giving
[1:10:41] away land for peace is that right
[1:10:43] what a
[1:10:44] horrible
[1:10:45] evil demon satan is
[1:10:48] it's a good adversary though
[1:10:51] it's taken away the land where they can
[1:10:52] even
[1:10:53] can't even drill foil they give away
[1:10:55] land
[1:10:57] for peace do they get peace
[1:11:00] no pieces of missiles coming at them but
[1:11:03] they don't get any peace
[1:11:05] sheesh
[1:11:07] it's a great study
[1:11:09] now
[1:11:10] so far we've talked about
[1:11:13] uh
[1:11:15] the the positioning of of of
[1:11:18] the
[1:11:19] the the um
[1:11:21] of the patriarchs in in the the
[1:11:24] land of israel okay
[1:11:26] let's look at israel and her birth pains
[1:11:29] okay
[1:11:30] and i'm going to start just reading as
[1:11:31] much as fast as i can
[1:11:33] and that's all i want to do is read from
[1:11:34] now on israel had birth pains under
[1:11:37] every prophet that came to the earth she
[1:11:39] had birth pains at his message for what
[1:11:42] did it do the prophet had the word so
[1:11:44] therefore when god sent a prophet the
[1:11:46] church itself went into birth pains
[1:11:48] because the prophet the word of the lord
[1:11:50] comes to the prophet him only he she had
[1:11:54] birth pains
[1:11:55] why
[1:11:56] she she's bringing a little bit more of
[1:11:58] the word
[1:12:01] what are they trying to produce finally
[1:12:06] the messiah
[1:12:08] the beginning was the word the word was
[1:12:10] with god and the word was god and the
[1:12:12] word was made flesh and dwelt among us
[1:12:15] they knew he was coming
[1:12:17] behold the virgin shall conceive
[1:12:20] is that right
[1:12:21] this is this is not gonna happen until
[1:12:23] shino comes they're all reporting
[1:12:26] looking i just gotta shut up i've just
[1:12:27] gotta read because i'm not running out
[1:12:28] of time
[1:12:32] now the she that's israel brought forth
[1:12:34] this complete word which was made flesh
[1:12:38] under birth pains of the prophet that
[1:12:40] blasted out he's a coming
[1:12:43] he's a coming pointing to that just i
[1:12:46] should have read it instead of saying
[1:12:47] commented
[1:12:50] till finally
[1:12:52] who's the seventh messenger
[1:12:55] to israel
[1:12:56] to their
[1:12:57] layuri saiyan
[1:13:00] naked
[1:13:01] miserable wretched church age who was
[1:13:04] there elijah
[1:13:06] who was their seventh church's message
[1:13:08] messenger i just gave it away
[1:13:10] say it to me nice and loud
[1:13:12] elijah
[1:13:13] call william branham
[1:13:15] no call what
[1:13:17] john the baptist
[1:13:19] is john the baptist center as a
[1:13:22] forgotten
[1:13:24] it's like brother bernie was saying when
[1:13:26] i was sitting last wednesday night he
[1:13:27] says i've only got one door left to me
[1:13:30] open said brother branham that's phoenix
[1:13:32] arizona is that right
[1:13:35] god said to him what is that to thee
[1:13:37] follow about me
[1:13:38] don't worry about it
[1:13:42] but
[1:13:43] john the baptist is out there baptizing
[1:13:45] on the jordan river he says you know
[1:13:47] what guys i got a secret for you
[1:13:49] i'm going to introduce to you the
[1:13:50] messiah i just baptized you with water
[1:13:52] but this is a guy coming he's going to
[1:13:53] baptize you with holy ghost and fire i'm
[1:13:55] not even worthy to loosen his shoelace
[1:13:59] well if he's not he's not worthy to
[1:14:01] loosen the shoelaces why did that
[1:14:03] prostitute do that
[1:14:04] why did that prostitute wash his feet
[1:14:08] why
[1:14:10] she's not he's not worthy why should she
[1:14:12] do that
[1:14:14] because he's speaking like a prophet and
[1:14:16] you got to hear how prophet speaks
[1:14:18] because when a prophet when he the
[1:14:20] prophet knew that when the messiah would
[1:14:22] come
[1:14:26] when boaz would come
[1:14:29] he would take off his shoe
[1:14:31] he's on latching shoelace
[1:14:34] as the work of the redeemer
[1:14:36] and he would throw the shoe at the guy
[1:14:40] is that right so he wasn't talking about
[1:14:42] the literal shoe
[1:14:45] the work of the redeemer i'm not even
[1:14:47] worthy to take part in that redemption
[1:14:49] work you don't know what i'm talking
[1:14:51] about go to psalms 49 10.
[1:14:56] i gotta be quiet
[1:14:58] and the church now this this that was
[1:15:00] that was israel is that right
[1:15:02] yes or no that was israel going through
[1:15:05] her birth pains
[1:15:08] and for confirmation here we go now
[1:15:10] let's place one thing at least does does
[1:15:13] brother brown said that joshua should be
[1:15:14] called the ephesians of the old
[1:15:16] testament
[1:15:19] this is not my doctrine
[1:15:21] i'm just saying what brother brown said
[1:15:22] and if it isn't that way then i'm wrong
[1:15:25] and that's okay i'll keep looking
[1:15:27] like the brother said sigelei
[1:15:31] but you can see how
[1:15:32] that joshua
[1:15:36] is holy spirit is that correct
[1:15:38] the holy spirit is now starting to place
[1:15:41] down here things in order yes
[1:15:44] so joshua
[1:15:46] is now this is the the the paul
[1:15:49] of his church age is that correct
[1:15:53] not going to talk about the in the other
[1:15:54] ones because i i i have to study them in
[1:15:56] detail myself brother and sister i'll
[1:15:58] tell you
[1:16:00] but in their dark ages what do they have
[1:16:03] in their dark ages over here
[1:16:07] jezebel
[1:16:09] yes or no
[1:16:10] and who confronts jezebel
[1:16:12] elijah
[1:16:15] wait a minute are you going to tell me
[1:16:16] that elijah has two comings with the
[1:16:18] jews yeah he actually has three comes
[1:16:20] with the jews
[1:16:22] he's got elijah
[1:16:24] then elisha
[1:16:26] is that right
[1:16:28] then elijah over there john the baptist
[1:16:31] then to us we get elijah over here
[1:16:35] yes or no
[1:16:38] don't forget it's elijah all the way
[1:16:39] through really you want to look at it
[1:16:41] that way
[1:16:42] those of you that know that brother said
[1:16:44] this i'd like for you to say amen so the
[1:16:46] other know that we're know what we're
[1:16:47] talking about
[1:16:48] 1965 november time frame brother bam
[1:16:51] says i forget that it thinks in november
[1:16:53] i forget the exact message but he says
[1:16:55] the elijah of our age is the lord jesus
[1:16:59] christ
[1:17:06] but here what i really love about it
[1:17:09] right here
[1:17:11] sorry i meant stuff
[1:17:16] but i love it right here is that
[1:17:18] god pulls a wool over their eyes
[1:17:22] and he sends a little girl
[1:17:25] 16 year old girl
[1:17:28] riding horse
[1:17:30] farm girl never never rode a horse
[1:17:32] before all of a sudden she's riding a
[1:17:34] horse down
[1:17:35] never let her never let an army before
[1:17:36] she's a farm girl
[1:17:39] illiterate
[1:17:42] now she's now she's riding a horse
[1:17:44] now she's close to the king the future
[1:17:46] king he says god sent me to you for me
[1:17:49] to break the siege of orleans
[1:17:53] they're all going
[1:17:56] where is your pedigree
[1:17:59] what college did you go to what college
[1:18:02] did you go to
[1:18:07] what's your name all she would call
[1:18:08] herself was i am joan the maid or joan
[1:18:10] the virgin
[1:18:13] contrasted to
[1:18:14] jezebel the harlot
[1:18:17] you get the idea
[1:18:18] and it's during that during that age
[1:18:20] what did that tyrone church age
[1:18:23] when god sends joan of arc we already
[1:18:25] talked about her before right
[1:18:27] races are dead prays for the sick
[1:18:30] miracles left and right
[1:18:34] and now let's go to now let's go to the
[1:18:36] church
[1:18:37] this our church is now this is this you
[1:18:39] see it here
[1:18:42] because here you have elijah
[1:18:45] john the baptist
[1:18:46] when he's going to bat when he's going
[1:18:48] to baptize jesus he says behold
[1:18:50] the lamb of god that
[1:18:52] takes away the sin of the world amen
[1:18:54] amen
[1:19:00] thank you brother
[1:19:04] and then our elijah's going to say to us
[1:19:08] some people i know some people say he
[1:19:09] had already took place
[1:19:12] in a comp and us
[1:19:14] fulfillment one of the compound
[1:19:15] fulfillments of it behold the lamb of
[1:19:18] god coming in glory
[1:19:20] brother brandon brother bernie already
[1:19:22] preached about that
[1:19:26] yes
[1:19:28] yeah that's a compound fulfillment but
[1:19:30] one day he's really coming back
[1:19:34] and he'll be here
[1:19:36] he's here and it's on tape they say say
[1:19:38] what the tapes say say what the tape say
[1:19:40] okay i'll say what the tapes say just
[1:19:42] don't call me a liar because i say what
[1:19:43] the tapes say someday he says he'll
[1:19:45] point the people to a word-born bride
[1:19:47] then he'll point the bride to the skies
[1:19:49] and his appearing saying behold the lamb
[1:19:52] of god coming in glory will come forth
[1:19:54] from his lips
[1:19:56] that's a literal fulfillment
[1:19:59] that's the rapture
[1:20:00] and where will it take place
[1:20:02] we heard wednesday night
[1:20:04] in jerusalem
[1:20:06] and
[1:20:08] now
[1:20:09] i gotta
[1:20:11] continue
[1:20:14] now the church
[1:20:16] is going through some birthdays it had
[1:20:18] to go through birth pains before it
[1:20:19] could give each one of the prophets now
[1:20:21] we're talking about new testament
[1:20:22] prophets you get the idea now
[1:20:25] when
[1:20:27] paul if paul martin
[1:20:29] paola arenas martin columba
[1:20:34] martin columba
[1:20:35] luther wesley
[1:20:37] elijah
[1:20:38] got it
[1:20:39] seven did i count them right something
[1:20:41] like that
[1:20:42] they're all
[1:20:43] reformers but brother man comes from
[1:20:45] prophet salsa
[1:20:46] new testament a new testament preacher
[1:20:48] didn't brother branstad new testament
[1:20:49] preachers a prophet
[1:20:51] that's right
[1:20:52] and each in each one of those prophets
[1:20:54] when they came to the world there was a
[1:20:56] birth pain to the church
[1:20:58] and i keep reading
[1:21:03] remember birth pain is not easy it hurts
[1:21:08] she the church had birth pains under
[1:21:10] luther now we know that there's seven
[1:21:12] church ages and seven messengers to them
[1:21:15] church ages according to revelations now
[1:21:17] when luther had to come forth it
[1:21:19] certainly threw the church into birth
[1:21:22] pain
[1:21:23] but it brought forth a luther that's
[1:21:25] right
[1:21:26] after that it got in trouble again so it
[1:21:29] got it brought forth a wesley
[1:21:32] that's right got forth again and brought
[1:21:34] forth a pentecost
[1:21:37] pentecost had birth pains too and it
[1:21:40] brought the ministry of the son of man
[1:21:42] is that correct
[1:21:44] and they all said who's crazy
[1:21:47] you know what i'm talking about
[1:21:49] if you don't know what i'm talking about
[1:21:50] it's just not a man
[1:21:51] i'm not talking about brother bannon
[1:21:53] but i am
[1:21:55] but i'm not
[1:21:56] you're confusing me brother ernie
[1:21:59] it's compound fulfillment
[1:22:01] brother brandon was brother brown a son
[1:22:02] of man
[1:22:03] said i'm just the son of man revealing
[1:22:05] this this the son of man
[1:22:07] but son of man he says means prophet
[1:22:10] and when the lord jesus christ was in
[1:22:12] brother branham saying
[1:22:14] you're from uh
[1:22:16] such and such 28 24 west banker street
[1:22:19] your name is such and such
[1:22:21] you got such a such melody that wasn't
[1:22:23] brother bob speaking
[1:22:25] that was the jesus christ and brother
[1:22:26] branham manifesting the ministry of the
[1:22:28] son of man
[1:22:31] the whole 40 is a 50 song you can't have
[1:22:34] one you can't have one without the other
[1:22:39] i guess they have they made a campbell
[1:22:41] soup commercial now something i don't
[1:22:43] know
[1:22:47] there we go
[1:22:50] don't you see how those messages has
[1:22:51] come with birth pain but the live left
[1:22:54] right out of there to go to the next
[1:22:55] message the life went right out of
[1:22:57] luther into wesley's message right out
[1:22:59] of western's message into the pentecost
[1:23:00] message now it's time to leave the shock
[1:23:03] what's the matter
[1:23:04] there's nature in every form declaring
[1:23:06] that's the truth
[1:23:08] so the church really

[1:23:50] middle so we are in birth pain a message
[1:23:53] from god always throws the church into
[1:23:54] heavier pain but after a while she's

[1:23:57] will bring forth jesus christ to the
[1:24:00] bride what that's double talk no it
[1:24:03] isn't
[1:24:04] just read it and study and you'll see
[1:24:05] what it is
[1:24:08] that's the great mystery
[1:24:10] go to colossians 1 18-25
[1:24:13] that mystery which of which i have made
[1:24:15] a minister of paul says
[1:24:17] that great ministry that has been hid
[1:24:20] through the ages
[1:24:21] which is
[1:24:22] it's going to come he's going to come in
[1:24:23] this day this month this year that's not
[1:24:25] the mystery
[1:24:26] what is the ministry he says so simply
[1:24:28] he says christ in you
[1:24:31] the hope of glory that's the mystery
[1:24:35] what is the mystery of god reveal christ
[1:24:37] in you
[1:24:38] the hope of glory
[1:24:41] christ being born in you paul said i
[1:24:45] travail in birth until christ be formed
[1:24:49] in you
[1:24:51] escalations i think four
[1:24:55] i had it to read but too much not enough
[1:24:57] time
[1:24:58] god has said some in the church
[1:25:01] through the labor pains
[1:25:06] oh they get tremendous sometimes
[1:25:09] when a church is groaning under the
[1:25:10] persecution of the outside world how
[1:25:13] they groan and cry under labor pains oh
[1:25:17] oh
[1:25:18] but then they are born and positionally
[1:25:21] born into the kingdom of god then the
[1:25:23] holy ghost has said in the church some
[1:25:27] apostles some prophets some teachers
[1:25:30] some pastor some evangelist
[1:25:34] and he says the apostles of when he sent
[1:25:36] the apostles right after the prophet
[1:25:38] left people rejected that
[1:25:40] fivefold ministry oh
[1:25:44] oh no i'm just staying with a prophet
[1:25:48] what about the apostles
[1:25:51] god set him in the church i'm staying
[1:25:54] with the prophet's tapes
[1:25:59] then he sends teachers
[1:26:02] i'm staying with the apostle only
[1:26:05] amen
[1:26:07] pastors oh i'm staying home listen to
[1:26:10] tapes i don't need a pastor
[1:26:13] evangelist
[1:26:20] so right now everybody that wants to be
[1:26:23] an apostle
[1:26:25] or an evangelist
[1:26:28] it's easier they're none what's the word
[1:26:30] they're not non-controversials
[1:26:33] what can't speak bad about that because
[1:26:37] he's an evangelist
[1:26:39] what about the prophets
[1:26:41] minor prophets
[1:26:44] pastors they're here pastor here master
[1:26:46] your pastor your pastor there pastor
[1:26:47] everywhere pastor pastor pastor
[1:26:52] the teacher they go
[1:26:57] i'll tell you one thing i ain't no
[1:26:58] teacher
[1:27:01] i'm myself i'm a stupid institute
[1:27:02] teacher
[1:27:08] my wife doesn't want me to say that but
[1:27:09] i said it i'm sorry i said it
[1:27:12] so here we go
[1:27:14] it's water i gotta finish it's water
[1:27:16] this is not the end that was the church
[1:27:18] now here's you individual
[1:27:20] you got to go through justification by
[1:27:22] faith
[1:27:23] i'm going to just skip through here
[1:27:24] justification by faith
[1:27:29] sanctification of the spirit and then
[1:27:32] the holy spirit comes in and gives new
[1:27:35] birth
[1:27:36] part one
[1:27:38] and fills that vessel
[1:27:40] part two
[1:27:45] didn't brother batman say that sometimes
[1:27:47] when you receive the holy ghost you have
[1:27:48] a little temper tantrum brother tim i
[1:27:50] know i have them sometimes
[1:27:52] what the brother man said does the holy
[1:27:54] spirit leave you
[1:27:55] no it says that rest over there in the
[1:27:56] gable end of the building i guess always
[1:27:58] conspiring to use that means like the
[1:27:59] end of the roof or something like that
[1:28:00] at the gable end of the building what's
[1:28:02] a gable alex
[1:28:04] gable is like a
[1:28:05] vegan
[1:28:07] truss
[1:28:08] sends it at the gable end of the
[1:28:10] building
[1:28:11] waiting for your goaty nature
[1:28:14] to turn back into a lamb again
[1:28:17] then it can come back to you
[1:28:20] how long does it take for me sometimes
[1:28:21] weeks months
[1:28:23] year sometimes
[1:28:26] brother bernie one day he preached see
[1:28:28] the spiritual and i was think i think i
[1:28:30] was sitting right here and he comes up
[1:28:32] to here and he starts preaching starts
[1:28:33] saying like this
[1:28:35] is
[1:28:42] he's preaching to you guys looks like
[1:28:43] i'm preaching to you guys right
[1:28:45] but he's standing right here right there
[1:28:47] raise your hand if you think that's
[1:28:48] that's the truth that was the truth he
[1:28:49] was preaching to me that
[1:28:51] because i came back from brazil brother
[1:28:53] sick
[1:28:54] when i saw the ministry the turmoil and
[1:28:57] the ministry
[1:28:58] that would sometimes sit up in my bed
[1:29:00] raise your hand if it's true i know you
[1:29:02] don't like doing that
[1:29:03] wait wait sometimes awake
[1:29:05] waking up in the middle from a dead
[1:29:06] sleep waking up just screaming
[1:29:09] my heart off
[1:29:12] torture
[1:29:13] birth pains
[1:29:16] and i saw that and i said man that was
[1:29:18] an 81 was it honey it was 181 i said if
[1:29:21] the
[1:29:22] ministry is like that
[1:29:24] no wonder the people are in the shape
[1:29:25] they're in amen
[1:29:27] and it happened again in 88
[1:29:30] and it happened again in 2000
[1:29:37] and this is not about me

[1:30:27] speak on this subject it says building
[1:30:29] the living tabernacle just go ahead and
[1:30:31] read that
[1:30:32] read that message again and you'll see
[1:30:33] that it's that is that's what that's
[1:30:35] what is that's what it says
[1:30:45] and i'm going to go very fast through
[1:30:46] the next few slides so you can see what
[1:30:48] i'm talking about
[1:30:49] brother ben said now you got to be born
[1:30:51] again and born again produces faith
[1:30:54] all right then after you've got faith

[1:32:18] faith when you're born again you have
[1:32:19] faith god has given to every man a
[1:32:21] measure of faith
[1:32:23] but we talked about in our bible lessons

[1:32:55] come back here to stand here
[1:33:01] it's like starting your car brother bam
[1:33:03] said that's a baby
[1:33:05] a childlike faith that's how simple it
[1:33:07] is that's how simple this faith is right
[1:33:09] here that i'm going to show you right
[1:33:10] now
[1:33:13] your life your birth pains are coming on
[1:33:15] this is that's to do with the when you
[1:33:17] kind of
[1:33:18] you're
[1:33:19] born again this is how my experience
[1:33:21] came from i can't i don't have time for
[1:33:23] that now running out of time it must be
[1:33:25] an absolute absolute birth
[1:33:32] and here we've skipped through the
[1:33:34] quotes where brother ben talks about
[1:33:36] you're yearning some there's something
[1:33:37] inside your yearning you don't you don't
[1:33:39] like being here more
[1:33:40] that's you yearning for your other body
[1:33:43] you're sick and tired of this place
[1:33:46] something says it's a little bird called
[1:33:48] your soul
[1:33:49] seeking that other body
[1:33:51] and you're gonna have to go through
[1:33:52] birth pains for that would you please
[1:33:54] stand
[1:34:02] if she's here i'm gonna ask your sister
[1:34:04] samara to come forward so you can pray
[1:34:05] for her
[1:34:08] time is over now
[1:34:10] if anybody else
[1:34:12] would like a prayer by the elders you
[1:34:13] can come forward but the only one we
[1:34:15] have officially here's sister stomata
[1:34:25] she's
[1:34:26] asking for
[1:34:29] procedure medical procedures she's
[1:34:31] standing in place with someone else
[1:34:37] come forward sister
[1:34:39] the elders who come forward right now
[1:34:41] laid hands on you
[1:34:45] it's a solemn moment
[1:34:56] you sisters know better than we men
[1:34:58] we know it from a conceptual standpoint
[1:35:02] but your sisters know what birth pains
[1:35:04] are all about
[1:35:05] those of you that are mothers
[1:35:08] you know it's not an easy thing
[1:35:11] so just remind your husbands
[1:35:15] about the time that we're living in
[1:35:16] right now
[1:35:17] the world is going through birth pains
[1:35:21] the religious chur the religious world
[1:35:24] is going through birth pains
[1:35:26] in the message there are things going
[1:35:29] many churches are going through birth
[1:35:30] pains
[1:35:32] this church is going through birth pains
[1:35:34] you're you as an individual are going
[1:35:36] through birth pits
[1:35:38] so their birth pains left and right
[1:35:41] we just have to just yield to god
[1:35:45] and just read it in jeremiah chapter 4 i
[1:35:47] think it is 31 maybe verse
[1:35:50] it talks about the daughter of zion
[1:35:52] brother battle said that's always
[1:35:54] the bride so that's a new another key
[1:35:58] for when you study the messages in
[1:36:00] isaiah another place where you see talk
[1:36:01] to a daughter of zion daughter or zion
[1:36:03] daughter resign
[1:36:04] they go they walk down the street
[1:36:06] tinkling as they go and so forth
[1:36:08] that's the daughter of zion it's it's
[1:36:10] crept into in the bride
[1:36:13] so uh
[1:36:14] the elders of the other
[1:36:17] elders would like to join us please come
[1:36:19] forward
[1:36:28] let us bow our heads so we can pray
[1:36:31] and then our brother who will be singing
[1:36:33] will be coming up in just a moment after
[1:36:35] the prayer
[1:36:37] heavenly father we thank you lord for
[1:36:38] the few words we were able to get out to
[1:36:41] this morning lord
[1:36:43] like i said
[1:36:45] it was not
[1:36:47] an overall completely comprehensive
[1:36:51] or talk
[1:36:53] or
[1:36:54] whatever people want to call it
[1:36:57] on birth pains it was just to get the
[1:36:58] people to study a little bit more
[1:37:00] there's so so so much more on the topic
[1:37:03] that i'd never covered never even
[1:37:04] touched
[1:37:08] but i ask you that you help each one
[1:37:10] that
[1:37:11] has an interest in it to go study it
[1:37:14] and right now lord as we address you
[1:37:19] in prayer for her sister samoda
[1:37:22] you know her just you know you know her
[1:37:24] request lord
[1:37:25] it doesn't have to be read out loud i
[1:37:26] already mentioned it
[1:37:29] you know what it is lord
[1:37:32] you know her desire and that of her
[1:37:34] loved one
[1:37:37] all we're asking is for
[1:37:39] you to come on and on the scene
[1:37:43] and may they when they receive their
[1:37:45] answer lord they come back and say thank
[1:37:47] you lord give a testimony saying lord
[1:37:49] you are true to your word
[1:37:53] that's what we ask you lord
[1:37:56] well your word says that
[1:37:58] those that overcame
[1:38:00] the dragon
[1:38:03] which still was the compound fulfillment
[1:38:05] they overcame the dragon by the by their
[1:38:08] testimony
[1:38:09] and the blood of the lamb
[1:38:11] so it is the blood of the lord jesus
[1:38:14] christ we overcome
[1:38:16] our testimony we say
[1:38:18] thank you god for what you did for us
[1:38:20] publicly

[1:38:26] what jesus did for me but we're just
[1:38:28] singing we should say it lord jesus
[1:38:30] write it down
[1:38:31] bring it up here so it can be read from
[1:38:33] the platform so sister brother such as
[1:38:35] such thanks god for healing them of

[1:50:58] hallelujah
[1:51:18] first of all
[1:51:21] on behalf of my mom and the rest of the
[1:51:23] family
[1:51:26] we would like to thank you for your
[1:51:27] prayers
[1:51:30] and those that went to the hospital to
[1:51:32] visit my dad
[1:51:35] oh i'm up here just to
[1:51:38] set the record straight it's taking off
[1:51:42] there's one sister here i won't mention
[1:51:44] her name
[1:51:46] that my mom spoke to
[1:51:48] me
[1:51:49] that she may have understood
[1:51:53] misunderstood what my mom was telling
[1:51:56] her about my dad okay
[1:52:00] anybody else
[1:52:03] uh
[1:52:04] might have been misinformed
[1:52:07] but i want you to know peroquito we
[1:52:09] would like you to know on behalf of the
[1:52:10] garcia family
[1:52:14] that my doc my dad did not have a stroke
[1:52:17] he went to the doctor
[1:52:20] they wanted to run some tests on him
[1:52:24] and uh my mom chose to admit him to the
[1:52:27] hospital
[1:52:30] they said that
[1:52:31] it was either go to the hospital and get
[1:52:32] everything done all at one time
[1:52:37] or go
[1:52:39] to several locations
[1:52:41] throughout the week and have everything
[1:52:42] done on outpatient basis
[1:52:48] and so it would be easier and better for
[1:52:50] her
[1:52:53] she chose to
[1:52:56] have him admitted to the hospital
[1:52:59] hospital and uh
[1:53:01] please forgive me if this offends you
[1:53:04] and this is coming from me this is not
[1:53:06] from my mom yes
[1:53:08] um if you guys hear anything see
[1:53:12] please don't start any rumors
[1:53:15] uh there was one sister that called me
[1:53:16] and she knows who she is i spoke to her
[1:53:20] she was told that my dad did have a
[1:53:22] stroke yes
[1:53:25] she called me i didn't answer so i
[1:53:27] called her back
[1:53:31] and to me that's the way it should be
[1:53:32] done
[1:53:35] if you hear something whether it's
[1:53:37] for for my father or anybody else
[1:53:43] don't go running off

[1:53:45] and uh saying things that you don't even
[1:53:48] know if they're true no yes
[1:53:51] yes
[1:53:52] because to me this is what happened with
[1:53:54] brother bernie
[1:53:56] people started posting that he had a
[1:53:57] stroke
[1:54:01] or whatever happened to him
[1:54:04] so i called one of his daughters
[1:54:07] and she didn't even know and she said
[1:54:08] that was not true
[1:54:11] on something like this
[1:54:14] and not only for my family you know so
[1:54:16] that'd be familiar but for yours also
[1:54:17] sino para las you say estambien if you

[1:54:20] you can call me
[1:54:22] you can call my my one of my sisters or
[1:54:24] my sister or my brother
[1:54:27] if you can't get a hold of us
[1:54:31] at the time uh leave a message
[1:54:34] we will get back to you and i'm sure
[1:54:36] like anybody else
[1:54:40] and uh but the reason that's the reason
[1:54:42] i'm here this morning
[1:54:45] to let you know that my dad did not have
[1:54:46] a stroke
[1:54:52] if you continue to keep them in your
[1:54:53] prayers see man
[1:54:56] he's doing good
[1:54:58] in the movie he's he's getting a lot
[1:54:59] better
[1:55:00] he's it's just hard for him to come to
[1:55:02] service right now so luke is deficient
[1:55:05] but he is watching via the internet
[1:55:08] and
[1:55:09] those of you that went to the hospital
[1:55:13] to see him
[1:55:14] you know what i'm talking about
[1:55:16] concerning his condition
[1:55:21] so please keep him in your prayers
[1:55:24] along with our pastor junta mention

[1:55:40] so

[1:55:45] and if you heard from somebody
[1:55:47] on the alien
[1:55:48] the condition of my dad
[1:55:52] and unless it comes from the family
[1:55:55] or any part of the family doesn't have
[1:55:56] to be my immediate family no no
[1:56:04] and they give you guys a message and let
[1:56:06] you know the condition or if anything
[1:56:07] wherever it happened to my dad
[1:56:12] then you know that it's the truth
