of Hebrews and the word of the Lord reads and what shall I more say say for the time would fail me to tell of Gideon of Barack of Samson of Jeff fat and David also and Samuel and of the prophets who through faith subdued kingdoms wrought righteousness obtained promises stopped the mouth of lions quenched the violence of fire escaped the edge of the sword out of weakness were made strong waxed violent in in fight turned to to f to flight the armies of the aliens women received their dead raised to life again and others were tortured not accepting Deliverance that they might obtain a better resurrection and others had trial of cruel mockings and scourings yay moreover of bonds and imprisonment angos malos they were stoned they were saw asunder were tempted and were slain with the sword

Lord add blessing to the reading of his word please greet your neighbor [Music] you'd be so kind please be seated good morning my beloved brethren I greet each and every one of you in the precious name of the Lord Jesus Christ I'm grateful for this privilege as always to be able to speak with you this morning I would like to thank with all my heart to the Lord for allowing us the opportunity to live such Precious Moments gcia I'd like to thank our pastor and Apostle ber Gonzalez Garcia for having confidence in us to be able to stand in this holy place I'd like to thank the local Ministry our beloved brother Johnny Alvar and each and every one of you if the Lord might help me tomorrow I will be returning back to my home to be there with my beloved family from this moment I'd like to express my Thanksgiving for the affections of love that you've shown me I believe with all my heart that I'm not worthy of the love that you have shown unto me I was back in the back room and I wanted to cry I told Brother Fernando brother I want you to forgive me for any mistake if at any time I've abused your confidence in me in Phoenix I said you are for me here in Phoenix [Music] you are the stars that I always wanted to reach and I only want to love you honor you and respect you I thank you with all my being because he fulfilled my dream that I had as a child my my dream as a child was to come here and as I was as time was going on and I saw that my dream was not coming true when God gave brother Johan bich the opportunity to come to this country I thought my dream has finally come true I love very much or very dearly our brother joh he is my intimate friend with joh I I speak with him every day on a daily basis the reason he is the reason I sacrifice a few hours of my sleep every day my wife at times is waiting for me in bed but she doesn't make any protests anymore she knows that Johan is about to call I it I it i' like to talk to Johan I'm praying that he marries soon in that manner I know he won't call me [Laughter] anymore I'm going to miss his phone calls but I'm going to understand that he found his best friend our wife should be our best friend our faithful companion our our Hiding Place brother Paul Garcia on a certain occasion told me your true friend is your wife yeah she is such a friend of yours that you can even turn your back on her as you sleep so I I love my wife I always think why did she fall in love with me a man full of mistakes or errors uh traum traumatized that's why I love her because she loved me how many love your wives can you raise your hand so I can make sure thanks be to the Lord when God thought in giving man a good thing he thought in giving him a companion or a wife our sister our friend our our Confidant our handkerchief she is our everything this forgive me brother I'm a I'm a man that's in love I'm in love with God I'm in love with his creation I'm in love with Humanity or mankind I'm in love with his children I'm in love with magali I'm in love with my children I only want to live in love when was one is in love you don't see the mistakes that's why every each and every one of us need to fall in love when I began to see some mistakes in my wife it's not that she has a mistake it's that my love is growing smaller or low so then each and every one of us needs love we should be so deeply in love with one another I was talking with brother Julio C how it is that our Pentecostal Brethren could not live far away one from the other they had Services continually and when they would go out to say their goodbyes everyone in the midst of Tears would would say their goodbye it almost seemed like they would never see each other again the beautiful thing is that the next day there was going to be another service so it it's we should be living in a higher state than that the Brethren that are now asleep or dead in Christ Jesus they're waiting to be perfected by us and truly what crowns that building is love and where is love love is in this message where is the message it should be in my heart in your heart our Brethren cannot be perfected without us what what a tremendous responsibility the Lord has given we're living in a glorious age in a beautiful time and at the same time they're very dangerous we live now in a world that is almost in complete and utter Darkness the lights are now drawing dim today more than ever we need the light and Jesus said as I am in the world I am the light of the world but he also said ye are the light of the world Amen my beloved Brethren I would like to express some personal greetings from my brother chist he is the pastor in a in a city in Peru called aripa I was uh talking with him yesterday and he asked me to express his greetings toward you Brethren please smile would you'd be so kind thank you very much for me a smile means a lot I'm a very introverted man I'm very timid and that's the reason I am the way I am and my hands sweat my my feet my my legs tremble and they're all not only words it's a truth I thank the Lord Jesus for having mercy on me for making himself strong in my weakness my lips to be able to express the word of the Lord this morning with much love I would like to refer myself unto this scripture and bring it unto the day that we're living in today we're living in very confusing times very dark times if we look on the outside it almost seems like there's no more hope I always heard as a child that the young people is the future of a country of a society or of mankind if we look on the outside we're going to see see almost that the young people has no no guidance without any orientation they don't have even an identi and that says a lot that's telling us that there's no future left that we're almost at the end of time that that which Jesus spoke what the men of God have spoken what brother Branham preached to us what brother Bernie Garcia preached to us what God's men have spoken for us is now being fulfilled whether we be ready or not whether we believe it or not that is now being fulfilled before our eyes and we're not in shock at what is happening we are not of this world but we are in this world we're not from here but it pleased God for us to be manifested in this age now I believe with all my heart that I'm not just an experiment I'm not a product just of coincidence I'm a product of a plan A Superior mind thought and spoke and planned and I and you are a product of that Eternal thought we're not just a coincidence we've come to the Earth with a purpose God sent us to the Earth with a purpose and the reason for the word of the Lord is for us to be able to again again our mind and obtain our mind to be able to know who we are who am I where am I from where am I going why is it that I have been manifested those are questions that we have to answer answer amen my beloved there's just not enough time I particularly think that it's manifested in a very difficult time I know because of history that before you used to preach the gospel and you would then uh be able to uh fish in an abundance there was a lot there was an abundance of fish and now we cast the net of the gospel and at times we don't cast anything we don't catch anything and at times that wants to to make us go into depression but that is the age in which we have fallen our L to live we must be conscious of this to be able to not suffer to not be thinking that yesterday was better than today this is the best time for us God could not have manifested us in a better time and I'm happy for being able to live my day and this message recognizing your day and your message am amen Brethren I've read the book of Hebrews I I confess unto you that I haven't been able to sleep it was 3:30 this morning and I was sweating I I just was not sleepy I had to speak with my guardian angel Johan brother Johan brother Johan what do you want he said I need you to pray for me pray for me I need to sleep he prayed for me and two minutes later I don't know what happened I fell into a deep sleep it's a very dangerous time I was thinking in my mind what's the reason that time is so dark what is the reason that our children they're they're just disoriented what is the reason that there's almost just no hope left because if the young people are tomorrow and if the young people is disoriented then I can understand that there's just no tomorrow that we're living in the final time and I want to make an emphasis along with you in the scripture that we have read and in the importance to be able to take out of History Our Heroes and bring them to today amen amen or amen Brethren with the lack of Heroes because of the lack of Heroes our children have as Heroes to the to the Avengers yes how many have seen the Avengers amen or amen our children when they're born they have a great need to identify themselves with someone or something all of us and in our within our inner man we have the need to identify ourselves with something and that something converts itself into for us a hero for example when the child is born it's not mysterious to know that their immediate Heroes for them should be their parents amen amen or amen their parents we should be for our children the heroes that they should follow that's the reason why the son has to has to be raised amongst those two influences it's it's just a vital importance that for the child to be under the shadow of dad and under the shadow of mom now there's good Heroes and bad Heroes There's real heroes and there's fictional Heroes and as as we don't have our children and is immediate or close by they begin to choose fictitious Heroes the word hero means uh a man that that converts itself into uh an object of great admiration that it could be because of the model of his life or it could be because of his behavior the majority of the children of children have a hero in their infancy Heroes whom they admire it might be a real hero or an an a fictitious hero what is it that surrounds a child first it's the parents second it's the Brethren the family the friends they are called to be the heroes children that are learning to live now the reason is that that's going to allow that child stability to have stability because a hero is a model or a role model to to follow I was observing that children don't learn much from the speaking or from the word they learn by example so then I can understand why it is that brother bradam said preacher Don't Preach me a thousand sermons just live one and who is that first preacher for the child if it's not mom please raise your hand female preachers thank you amen or amen Brethren I'm 46 years old I have the privilege to have my mom still living at 64 years of age every time that I see her she captures me to preach to me and that's something that's just natural in women women was just made to give she's always transmitting it's in her to nurture nurture her children them with the word of the Lord so then what's the best example for a child it's not so much what mom or dad say with their mouth it's the example which they observe in us because the example that they observe will turn into for them in a foundation in a role model if Darkness or evil has grown it's due to the lack of Heroes and due to the lack of Heroes incorrect our children are choosing incorrect Role Models Michel they follow Michael Jackson they follow Michael Jordan their hero is Superman the other hero is Spider-Man due to the lack of Heroes our children in their need to acquire a personality they're looking for a role model and at times when our children find them eles in trouble it's not so much because the devil is playing a trick on them but it might be that we're not being the right role mod for that is the need and that is the reason why us as [Music] parents must surrender completely to the Lord Jesus and through that surrendered life then we can be for them the example and that role model and that role model to follow thank you amen my beloved brethren are the heroes in the life of our children homes they need [Music] Heroes I remember in my imagination or in it as a child my dad was about six feet tall I can imagine he was he was a big man I remember when he was resting on his bed he was my everything he was my hero I saw his strong arms and I wouldn't grow tired of looking at him he was my role model to follow when he left I saw myself with the obligation to look for a father in every man that I would look on that's the reason why I would stand amongst the older the adults and my mom would say well my my son likes to go around with adults she did not know that I was looking for a father fig that I was looking for a hero I was looking for a role model to follow because I was growing up how important it is for the children to have the right influence the right example through their parents whatever you place on your child shall be there for their whole life that's why the Bible says instruct the child in his way and even when he is old he shall not leave it I remember when I went to start studying at six years old and in parallel they would teach me to write but at the same time they would teach me the history of Peru and the first thing they taught me was who my heroes were Miguel Miguel Francis franciscoi Marano M Marano mgar Roberto esari Roberto escavar Roi my hero now that I'm 46 years of age I asked myself why would they do that and it was to give me an identity because if I'm Peruvian I have to know my history I have to know the founding fathers because they're going to fill in me that void of Personality amen amen Brethren on a certain occasion I heard brother Bernie preach preach the law of meditation and there he speaks to us in just a precious way how it is that David entered into depression the Bible says that David could not close his eyes it says that he would refuse to be comforted he thought that God's Mercy on him had finished that the Bible says that he would ask or question he would consider himself that he was undone he would suffer at the thought that he was born but then verses as you continue David arrives at the conclusion that it was his fault it was not God's fault and if we continue on reading in the first verses of chapter 7 you can EST the law of meditation is established and there David is speaking to us how it is that we must teach our children from mouth to ear we must speak amen or amen if we don't speak with our children and I include myself in this because as I thought on this sermon I find myself still with defects I find that I'm not doing the right thing that it's not enough just in taking them to church it's not enough for just buying them a Bible it's not enough just to dress them right there's a deeper work to do we must establish the word of the Lord in our homes we must give the word of the Lord the place that it deserves and the place that the word deserves is the first place the word of God should govern our homes I have two small children my oldest is already working he's 19 years old fo and they're reading the martyrs of fox or or Fox book of Martyrs they read this book aloud it's not easy to make them read we have to kind of do a business dealing there and part of that negotiation I want to teach my children that everything in life it has a price if you read I'll give you if you don't read I won't give you any money and my wife says what are you doing I want to teach my children that everything in life has a price our Salvation has a price our joy has a price our healing has a price one had to pay the price so then when they began to read the way that our ancestors died I began to tremble I began to cry I cannot believe it so then I come to the conclusion why Abraham Lincoln was so great and he comments that his mom gave him two books the Bible and fox book of Mart what his mom did is to establish in the life of Abraham Lincoln the Heroes of Faith and that is what we have needed we must understand that faith has its Heroes and we must not forget them we have to bring them to our presence and not only stay in that but ask unto the Lord that he help us also to be able to convert ourselves into Heroes of Faith if evil taking control of mankind it's due to the lack of Heroes where are the heroes of the faith those that are willing to sacrifice themselves to give up everything so someone else can benefit amen my brethren history brother Paul Garcia taught me where did you talk so much with him very well brother when he arrived in Peru in two minutes I'm going to express something wisdom cannot be taught there's not there's no no way that wisdom can be taught there's no schools to be able to teach wisdom wisdom is transmitted then by the grace of God I found myself with this wise man of God I wanted to be next to him because just one little phrase meant so much to me I don't know if it for for you but for me one phrase changed my life one phrase saved my mom's home my life is based on phrases you don't need to talk to somebody for five hours to know what they have in their heart brother Bram said let me speak to somebody for three minutes and I'll tell you who they are let me see what they see let me see how they speak let me see how they stand let me see how they dress and I will tell you who he is we are written Epistles we are books and someone is reading us now there's good books and there's bad books amen amen amen or amen what kind of books do we want to be and there I tried to take advantage of the short amount of time that he could dedicate to us and on a certain occasion he told me history is m is memory I don't know if this makes you rejoice but for me it's a very deep thought because when we have no memory we have forgotten our history it's because we've forgotten who we are we don't even know where we come from we ignore where we're headed we've forgotten Our Heroes those Anonymous Heroes that gave up their life so that the gospel could continue today we have access to the word of the lord it's because of those Heroes that gave up their life willingly and joyfully for you and I amen amen Brethren children learn more from the example than from the words that they're spoken to how important it is to understand this if we could understand just that simple phrase the change that we're just waiting so much upon is going to begin to take form amen Brethren the help that we have need of is so close to us it's found in the word of the Lord as children of God God has sent us complete brother Bram said that the grain of wheat does not need anything everything that she has need of is found in in her everything that you or I have need of is found within us I remember the first time I came here I spoke to you with permission from my brother Bernie about my heroes I I spoke um to brother Bernie Garcia PA I I also mentioned brother Paul Garcia I mentioned brother l i I mentioned Cal perz who was also in the audience Fabi Bernal I I mentioned Fabi Bernal I mentioned David Lucero I even mentioned Alber herandez My Heroes what would have been of me without my heroes what would have been of me without those role models to follow what would have been of me without those examples but now brother Paul isn't here and I'm deeply saddened by this and I've asked God how could it be that you took a man with so much wisdom so then in me has awoken a great interest interest into looking and searching out for his work because there is where the wisdom is we need Heroes I'm 46 years old I'm a young preacher I'm just barely beginning in the ways of I'm a I have a great need of Heroes and just like I said the first time I've come to Phoenix Arizona to give honor to my heroes you are my hero and I don't know if you believe it but I believe it with all my heart you know what politicians say when the United States sneezes the whole world has flu what it has what does a sneeze have to do with my flu what they're saying is that you are our role models to follow how incredible brothers and sisters that someone imitate sometimes we're walking through life without knowing that somebody is imitating us at times we're just walking through life just wondering without knowing that for someone we're going to be an influence it might be positive or it might be negative we're going to be an influence and someday we'll be responsible I shall be responsible for my wife for my children for the congregation that puts me in a very difficult situation that takes me to the conclusion that the only thing I have left is to surrender to the Lord not 20% not 30% not 50% oh brother scavi I surrender to the Lord oh how much have you surrender God Demands a complete surrenderance everything or nothing amen or amen God just doesn't want the the minuscal things God doesn't want just a God wants everything for me to have the courage to surrender completely to his word to recognize that without him I am nothing Breen I believe with all my heart that I'm nothing I'm unworthy I don't deserve what I'm living but I'm thankful unto the Lord for that precious Grace for that Mercy for that love that has been expressed because God expressed his love for me he expressed his love for you we are a fruit of his love it's not by works so no man can can I can't boast about my own my own doings my works are Darkness but I I am I I boast of the works of the cross I believe we're all resting on that amen Brethren you have the opportunity to be the hero that your child needs you have the opportunity to be the hero of that new generation of those young people of our children they're looking for Heroes why do you think I I I named my eldest son Peter why do you think I named my second son bernabe do you think I just placed their name that name because it's beautiful I I I named him Peter because of Pedro P I love Pedro P My Hero if love were to die down I'm indebted for life why do you think I named bernabe my second son because of my heroes Bern Gonzalez Garcia because of Bern Gonzalez Garcia Bern Nikolas Castillo Garcia j Bern Nicolas Garcia Junior for so I wouldn't forget about my heroes for me they're important why do you think I named my daughter B letia because it's a beautiful name I placed her name B because of Pedro Pena's daughter ber Lea because of brother Bernie Jr's wife and Elizabeth because of the love of my life aren't you in love with magali Elizabeth her second name is Elizabeth I would like for you to understand me we all have need of Heroes it might be a young person it might be an adult or you might be an elder man we all need I lost my father and I see in every elder man a father figure you still don't know what it means to me when someone calls me son when somebody calls me son something within me begins to break it's what I wanted to hear the most from my dad but he's now gone and from that day I'm looking for dads and if I can hug you look at me as your son and I'll see you as my father what's the reason we're all looking for Heroes we're looking for a role model to imitate if our children are wward it's because we have not understood that that the heroes have to be today and if if it's true we should speak to them about we should speak to them about Matthew about Elijah and Elisha of Gideon of Mary of Rahab we should speak about to them about them well what about today's heroes are there heroes or are there not Heroes and I've come once again to this country to give my tribute my last tribute to my hero Paul Garcia and I grow emotional as I see him sitting in the place of his father I was seeing him through the screen and I told the brother how beautiful someone has taken the place of my hero oh how beautiful how beautiful that is for me it's a show of Love or affection for me just a show of affection is worth more than a thousand words we learn more from the examples than we do from words and I saw him there seated I think that he's preaching to me he's telling his mom you're not alone we love you we're with you and we want Dad to be present amongst us always God's heroes must be remembered with all my heart what the word of the Lord says says brother Bram speaks to us about Elijah says Elijah would go into the cave and then the crows would come and feed him and brother Bram says that the crows are the preachers from that day I understood that I am a crow am amen or amen raise your hand if you're a crow so I don't feel alone it says the crows would give food to eat to elah Elijah has left but the crows are still maintain alive the voice of elishah through the preaching of the word amen amen or amen Breen if we stop talking about Elijah that Elijah shall die but as we continue to speak about as we preach what he preached elij is alive as we speak about Paul Garcia Paul Garcia is alive because the homage that our heroes deserve it's just it's not a funeral service flowers there in the grave site the homage the greatest homage that we can give a hero is to maintain them alive to maintain them fresh and tell our children that there are heroes of Fai just like that hero Bern Garcia Garcia bernabe Gonzalez Garcia me he is my hero and I teach my children you'll make 10 soles if you tell me the names of my heroes Pedro P Chavez ped P Chavez Pablo Garcia Pablo Garcia oh you beat me here you go what is it that I'm doing in in just in a childlike way I'm placing in the heart of my baby my heroes I want my children to fall in love with my heroes but I also want for them to fall in love with the hero of my heroes on a certain occasion my hero told me I'm tired at looking at myself in the mirror and I was hearing and I was thinking what is he trying to tell me I'm tired of seeing myself in the mirror and looking at my face I'm tired of speaking and hearing my own voice I'm tired of being myself I don't want to be like myself I don't want to be like ber Garcia I don't even want to try to be like William brandom and when he started to say things like that I started to go back how can this be if I want to be just like them what is this man saying to me I said who do you want to look like or be like I want to be Jesus when I see myself in the mirror I want to see Jesus the day I speak I want to hear Jesus then I realized that my heroes also had a hero who is the hero of my hero the hero of my hero is the Lord Jesus Christ to him be the glory to him be the Applause to him be all our worship let us speak about Jesus and he shall appear in our midst the two walking they were just demoralized darkness had taking control of their lives but unconsciously they began to speak about Jesus and at an instant a

the reason and the purpose for this this is for all of those that do not believe that William Mary and Bram Mar BR is a prophet of God all the visions that he had will come to pass some have already passed some will come to pass one of the visions that brother Bram had he said he saw a car going down the road and it was drivers L nobody was driving the car so now I want you to look at this little video for just a few minutes watch real carefully watch thisas 15 luxury in motion looks like a futuristic spaceship on Wheels the car can completely drive itself the driver's seat rotates 360° so the driver doesn't even have to face forward while on the road there are no buttons the car is controlled by guestures and motions the interior is designed to be like a cave that offers passengers a secluded peaceful environment Mercedes says the car's design is all about giving customers the true luxury of the future this this car gives people back the the most precious um Goods they can have which is time and space and in this car you can move from A to B at the same time do whatever you want uh teleconference and video conferencing uh doing your emails communicating with friends uh just relaxing sleeping um and all that while traveling the car is a concept Mercedes says it still needs to figure out the most important safety issues such as in the case of an unlikely crash where the car would decide to head towards a ditch or a wall Mercedes says it has already started implementing the auto driving technology in some of its cars and will continue to introduce the f-15s technology and style into its Fleet over the next decade in Las Vegas Nat Finn Fox News wow that's what I say look it's been 82 years 1933 brother Bram saw this car or a car just like it he said with egg shape and that Vision that brother Ram said here they're showing it to us now man man's showing it to us now every Vision that he had was he also said he said I'll be in a little room in a tent that's never been fulfilled one of the other visions that brother Bram had it's later than you think amen God is good and all the time God is good praise God how many love the Lord I thought I was going to explode in the in the back over here how many felt the presence of the Lord who can testify that they still feel the presence of the Lord praise God man good thing that we're um um in a time limit because I think we'd probably all just explode if we can do this all day long I'm just here to give the Sunday School report and um if your um child is between the ages of four and seven years old sister basio was the teacher and um the title of the teaching was God makes things new and the scriptures were Isaiah 4031 and Romans 122 I like that that we're using scripture to teach our kids if your child is between the ages of eight or 11 years old the teachers were brother Jeff and sister Maria suner and um the title of their teaching was the gift of love and the scripture was 1 Corinthians 13 1-3 if you have students between the ages 12 and 16 brother alvara was their teacher and his title of his teaching was sound mind and they use the scriptures Romans 12 1 the total offering was $109 that's a blessing considering we had 69 students total and um but there was only about 20 20 Bibles the good thing is the Sunday School finally got a shipment of about 40 something Bibles 45 so if you're uh if
