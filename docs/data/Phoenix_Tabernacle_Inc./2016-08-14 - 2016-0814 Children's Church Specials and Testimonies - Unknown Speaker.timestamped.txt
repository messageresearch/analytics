[21:31] all right thank
[21:32] [Music]
[21:39] you God bless you
[21:42] guys um so I sang this well I didn't
[21:46] sing this song when I was in New Mexico
[21:47] but I gave this testimony about you know
[21:50] just kind of what God's been doing in my
[21:52] life and I thought I'd share it with you
[21:53] guys before I sing and excuse me cuz I
[21:56] get a little nervous um um so this is
[22:00] pretty much about
[22:03] um my you know school and my career path
[22:07] and all of that and you know I um said
[22:10] it in Albuquerque because there were
[22:11] youth services and I was hoping maybe it
[22:13] could help somebody who was possibly
[22:15] going through something similar so um
[22:18] when I first graduated high school I was
[22:21] 17 I graduated early graduated a year
[22:23] early and um I had been you know with
[22:28] the person who was convincing me to you
[22:30] know do other things things that I
[22:32] wasn't even sure that I wanted to do so
[22:33] you know I was following career paths
[22:35] and going to school for something I
[22:36] didn't want to go to school for and I
[22:38] was in this relationship that was really
[22:41] harmful and um you know I'm just
[22:44] thankful that there were never like any
[22:47] doors of opportunity that opened when I
[22:49] was in that relationship when I was
[22:51] going through those career path because
[22:53] um now that I'm you know I've prayed a
[22:56] lot about it and now that I'm going
[22:58] you know for a veterinarian and all that
[23:00] you know God has just opened up doors
[23:02] like it's crazy how like if you just
[23:04] pray and you wait on God to give you the
[23:07] answer for whatever it is you're looking
[23:08] for even if you don't know what it is
[23:10] you're praying about you'll know when
[23:12] God gives you the answer he'll just open
[23:13] up doors for you and you know so just
[23:16] wait on him never stop praying and he's
[23:20] always there for you so just hoping that
[23:22] you know that helps somebody who's
[23:25] questioning you know college if they
[23:27] don't think it's for them if you know
[23:29] just pray and wait on God and if it's
[23:31] for you he'll open up doors and if it's
[23:33] not then he has something better in
[23:35] store for you
[23:36] so so I sang this song A couple Fridays

[29:46] you God bless
[29:49] you um I like to say something really
[29:51] short that God did in um in my life and
[29:56] um in my husband 's life he's blessed us
[29:59] with a a little baby boy coming into our
[30:03] lives soon um and I think the Lord for
[30:05] that but it wasn't
[30:07] always um a smooth ride and um at the
[30:12] very beginning when I we found out we
[30:15] were
[30:16] expecting um it was I was 6 weeks and I
[30:20] went to the doctors and the doctor was
[30:23] doing the ultrasound and
[30:26] said
[30:28] sorry um I start
[30:31] over oh okay um and said that you know
[30:36] she couldn't see she I was pregnant but
[30:39] she couldn't see a baby um that it was
[30:41] way too small and from the looks of it
[30:45] um she said I have to be honest with you
[30:48] you know she's like I want to see you in
[30:50] 2 weeks because there's a big
[30:53] possibility you're going to lose this
[30:55] baby and you know when you find out
[30:58] you're pregnant that's the last thing
[31:00] you want to hear you
[31:01] know
[31:03] um
[31:08] sorry and um I I left that appointment
[31:12] really disappointed upset mad because I
[31:16] was like I thought this was supposed to
[31:18] be a blessing in your life you
[31:20] know and um but she said you know this
[31:24] Within These two weeks you're basically
[31:26] going to find out if you're going to
[31:27] keep it or not and so those two weeks
[31:31] that were the hardest weeks of my life
[31:34] and um you know I had to really just be
[31:39] alone and I had to realize you know I
[31:42] could take this two ways I could either
[31:45] you know say God why why are you doing
[31:47] this to me you know this is not right or
[31:51] I can say I'm going to trust you you
[31:54] know and I decided to go that route
[31:57] because you know he's The Giver of Life
[32:00] and I I trust him with my life and and
[32:04] that's what I did you know those two
[32:06] weeks I put brother brandom and I was
[32:08] like you know what like I'm going to
[32:10] have this baby boy and and I'm just
[32:14] thankful that God gave me the strength
[32:15] to give us me and my husband the
[32:17] strength for those two weeks you know
[32:19] and we went back and our baby boy was a
[32:22] normal size and uh I just thank god um

[50:54] we've been TR traveling first we were
[50:56] with in Albuquerque with brother
[51:00] miguelos there were youth
[51:06] services and and truly God is doing a
[51:08] great work in New
[51:13] Mexico and it takes me
[51:16] back to when we had the first service in
[51:20] Albuquerque in Albuquerque Sheron in the
[51:23] Sheron Hotel
[51:28] when our pastor directed us to have a
[51:29] service
[51:32] there to so to see how our pastor's
[51:37] Vision albquerque has come to bless the
[51:40] people in albuquer it's really
[51:43] good because we know
[51:46] he's and we weren't a lot
[51:50] Brothers I believe there's more people
[51:52] here today than there were in the
[51:53] services in Al
[51:56] but the ones that were
[51:59] there the one who was
[52:02] there was the
[52:07] Lord and the Lord says and the Lord
[52:10] says English I'm going to say it in
[52:12] English all those who the father has
[52:14] given
[52:16] me will come to
[52:18] me right
[52:23] amen and so so not even one will be lost
[52:27] not even
[52:29] one I want to talk to the children for a
[52:33] second
[52:39] Albuquerque so but um from those that
[52:42] actually went to Albuquerque is there
[52:43] anyone that would like to share a small
[52:45] little testimony of what the Lord
[52:49] did while you think about
[52:52] that I want to tell the children
[52:54] something
[52:58] Albuquerque when we were in Albuquerque
[53:00] the Lord brought the young people a
[53:07] message that was titled
[53:11] influenceu
[53:15] influence is a really important thing
[53:17] for you and
[53:18] it's and it's very
[53:22] simple there's good influence
[53:26] the word of
[53:27] God and there's bad
[53:32] influence let's go to our scripture
[53:37] quickly it's going to be in first
[53:51] Corinthians be not deceived evil
[53:54] Communications corrupt good
[53:57] manners amen so in another version of
[54:01] the Bible it says be not deceived evil
[54:04] company corrupts good morals
[54:11] amen what I want to tell the
[54:18] children see if anybody is willing to
[54:20] testify of the goodness of
[54:23] the or anyone that went to on last
[54:30] week I want to tell you what the word of
[54:33] God is saying
[54:35] here that if we come
[54:38] together with Bad
[54:42] Company it's going to
[54:45] corrupt our good
[54:48] teachings
[54:50] morals which our
[54:52] parents our pastor
[54:55] has taught us come
[54:59] here either one come
[55:03] here it's so
[55:05] simple
[55:08] influence here's a little young man El
[55:12] Bernie can you come down here for a
[55:13] second yes sir El influ he's going to
[55:17] have good
[55:19] influence or Mala influen or bad
[55:24] influence
[55:27] you know you should really read your
[55:29] Bible uh you know at least once every
[55:32] day nah swack let's go play
[55:38] Pokemon it's that
[55:42] simple brother
[55:46] jaier told the young
[55:48] people so Bernie can do it in
[55:52] English he told the young people
[55:57] Al that if he started with one minute
[56:00] brother Alex a
[56:04] day and then from there begin a little
[56:06] more and a little more and a little
[56:12] more would be a great influence on their
[56:15] lives one
[56:20] minute how many have one minute that we
[56:23] can give the Lord
[56:27] can we try to read our Bibles for one
[56:29] minute
[56:32] amen Albuquerque also what was told in
[56:38] Albuquerque is that
[56:41] people uh on average how how would you
[56:43] say it in Spanish um on
[56:46] average I'm
[56:50] sorry uh di daily daily
[56:57] uh they use these
[57:02] things for on average four hours a
[57:07] day they
[57:12] check their social
[57:17] media at least 16 times a
[57:23] day so the Lord was telling the young
[57:25] people and brother Mike and brother
[57:27] Bernie
[57:28] theii if we have four
[57:31] hours that we're using
[57:35] this that we can give God a minute what
[57:38] do you think we give we give the Lord a
[57:45] minute the bad
[57:48] companies corrupt buenos Morales good
[57:52] morals so when you guys come
[57:57] young
[57:59] ladies young men
[58:03] adults
[58:05] elderly
[58:09] everyone when when we go with bad
[58:17] influences we have to not listen to
[58:23] that turn our back on
[58:29] it and walk towards the good
[58:32] influen thank you
[58:35] brother very simple
[58:37] right four hours a
[58:46] day they say that's tremendous because
[58:49] we're only awake for about 17 hours of
[58:51] the
[58:53] day

[58:56] onh or

[59:18] parents and just use them for
[59:22] emergencies okay you guys are too young
[59:23] to have Facebook pages
[59:30] [Laughter]
[59:36] Facebook that was part of the things
[59:38] that the Lord told us in Albuquerque
[59:39] isn't that
[59:41] tremendous and then in
[59:43] tuon we had a great
[59:47] time brother Junior preached the message
[59:50] so uh uh the spoken word is the Original
[59:53] Seed so
[1:00:05] amen if we plant and listen to the good
[1:00:10] influence and we plant that Original
[1:00:13] Seed in our
[1:00:16] hearts what's going to happen for
[1:00:20] us is there a kid that can tell us what
[1:00:22] will happen if we plant that seed in our
[1:00:26] heart somebody said something over here
[1:00:29] one of the young ladies
[1:00:32] somebody how about one of our youth
[1:00:34] young adults if you plant God's word in
[1:00:37] your heart what do you what kind of let
[1:00:39] me put it this way if you plant God's
[1:00:40] word in your heart what kind of fruit
[1:00:42] are you going to Bear bad fruit or good
[1:00:44] fruit Bernie good fruit brother Mike
[1:00:46] that's right good fruit amen amen okay
[1:00:49] so if you want to plant good
[1:00:53] fruit if you want to reap good
[1:00:58] fruit that's okay pry it's

[1:01:22] okay please please when you're done okay
[1:01:25] when I'm done
[1:01:33] okay so God in Simplicity using
[1:01:36] discipline to manage our
[1:01:41] time and be
[1:01:46] able the good SE
[1:01:49] seed in our
[1:01:52] hearts give us success in our
[1:01:56] lives it will give us
[1:01:59] Faith to ask
[1:02:02] God but we
[1:02:04] need in hard
[1:02:09] times doesn't mean that the hard times
[1:02:11] aren't going to
[1:02:14] come hard times will
[1:02:16] come but if we have
[1:02:19] faith to believe
[1:02:22] him there's nothing
[1:02:27] stand in front of
[1:02:30] us we have a sister that's going to give
[1:02:32] us a short little testimony so we make
[1:02:34] her for welcome give her an
[1:02:35] [Applause]
[1:02:40] Applause hi again guys
[1:02:48] um I'd forgotten that I was trying to
[1:02:50] speak more
[1:02:53] Spanish
[1:02:54] um when I said My Testimony I
[1:03:03] forgot so I'll say this one in English
[1:03:06] but because I haven't practiced up with
[1:03:07] my Spanish yet but that's okay so this
[1:03:09] is just like a simple testimony about
[1:03:11] some thoughts that I had while I was in
[1:03:17] Albuquerque Albuquerque so like growing
[1:03:20] up whenever I would go to like special
[1:03:23] services or like never would be the
[1:03:24] convention
[1:03:29] time I would always have the wrong
[1:03:32] mindset and the wrong
[1:03:40] motives it was always more like what am
[1:03:42] I going to wear who am I going to see
[1:03:43] who am I going to
[1:03:49] meet like I guess guy wise like oh am I
[1:03:52] going to see a guy like are going to be
[1:03:54] cute guys there and all
[1:04:00] that um but when I was um on our way to
[1:04:05] Albuquerque Albuquerque um the Lord just
[1:04:08] reminded me of this
[1:04:11] scripture and it's Romans 1
[1:04:15] 11-2 and it says for I long to see you
[1:04:19] goe for I long to see you that I may
[1:04:21] impart unto you some spiritual gift to
[1:04:24] the end ye may be established that is
[1:04:27] that I may be comforted together with
[1:04:29] you by the mutual Faith both you and me
[1:04:32] praise the Lord and you know when I like
[1:04:36] when I thought of it it just kind of
[1:04:37] reminded me of you know exactly why I'm
[1:04:46] going you I'm not going there so I can
[1:04:49] look
[1:04:53] good
[1:04:54] so I can like meet a guy or anything
[1:04:56] like
[1:04:57] that but you know I truly that's when I
[1:05:00] truly realize that I'm going there for
[1:05:07] Fellowship because it's one of the most
[1:05:09] encouraging things to
[1:05:14] me to just be with people that love God
[1:05:17] as
[1:05:20] well I used to be really jealous and
[1:05:29] envious of people who seem to be doing
[1:05:33] better spiritually than
[1:05:40] me me like especially with my it sounds
[1:05:43] horrible but like with my own best
[1:05:44] friends like when they were doing really
[1:05:46] good spiritually I got really jealous of
[1:05:53] that
[1:05:58] and you know that's like when I was on
[1:05:59] my way to Albuquerque that's when I
[1:06:01] realized that you know we're not here to
[1:06:05] compete with each other at
[1:06:12] all and we're truly here to encourage
[1:06:15] each
[1:06:19] other cuz if you know how bad it feels
[1:06:22] to be down why are you going to go and
[1:06:26] try to make somebody else feel the same
[1:06:27] way that you are
[1:06:35] feeling so you know just be kind to
[1:06:39] whoever you meet because you really
[1:06:41] never know people are going
[1:06:49] through and you know when I came back
[1:06:51] from Albuquerque um Satan started
[1:06:54] putting really horrible thoughts in my
[1:06:59] brain and I started to believe that my
[1:07:02] experience wasn't real and you know kind
[1:07:04] of like the after Camp feeling like oh
[1:07:05] it wasn't really real you didn't really
[1:07:07] receive anything it was all
[1:07:13] emotion and I'm not going to lie you
[1:07:15] know for a long time I had felt that God
[1:07:19] wasn't really in my life
[1:07:22] anymore
[1:07:26] you know because of things that have
[1:07:27] happened in my life um just unfair
[1:07:34] situations but that doesn't mean that
[1:07:36] God's not with you through those unfair
[1:07:42] situations so you know the past couple
[1:07:44] weeks I've been really
[1:07:47] really I've been really honest with
[1:07:52] myself and exactly what it is I want
[1:07:56] from the Lord or what I want for
[1:08:01] myself and you know he's just
[1:08:04] slowly bringing me back to his
[1:08:10] feet you know in many ways through
[1:08:13] friends family just music especially
[1:08:15] music is huge influence for
[1:08:22] me and so so um in Tucson in tuon um it
[1:08:27] was the Sunday night service the play
[1:08:29] was really really
[1:08:36] cute um the little kids did an awesome
[1:08:38] job probably better than I would have
[1:08:40] been able to
[1:08:44] do and brother Caleb um started singing
[1:08:48] this song and he kept singing it over
[1:08:49] and over and over
[1:08:52] again
[1:08:55] I forgot exactly how it went but um when
[1:08:58] he started singing it over and over and
[1:08:59] over again you know at first I was like
[1:09:01] okay like song's getting kind of boring
[1:09:03] now change the
[1:09:13] song but something just told me to be
[1:09:17] still and so I was I just close my eyes
[1:09:22] and I started to just listen to brother
[1:09:24] Caleb singing and the
[1:09:31] congregation and I just truly felt the
[1:09:34] sweet Spirit of the Lord just
[1:09:36] [Music]
[1:09:41] fall so yeah that's just a little bit of
[1:09:45] what happened in Albuquerque for me and
[1:09:47] then in
[1:09:52] Tu um so if they ever do have Services
[1:09:54] again you know I'm definitely going to
[1:09:56] be there because it was a lot of
[1:09:59] fun um like brother Mike said you know
[1:10:02] it wasn't a lot of people at
[1:10:05] all but it was truly something amazing
[1:10:09] and you know I just hope that we all
[1:10:11] just I know it sounds like super cheesy
[1:10:13] like we all hope to like love each other
[1:10:14] and all that stuff but just to be
[1:10:16] considerate of each
[1:10:22] other
[1:10:32] and I think things would just go a lot
[1:10:34] better you know even if even if you
[1:10:36] don't like someone for whatever reason
[1:10:38] it is just be nice to
[1:10:47] them when you just show kindness when
[1:10:50] you just even if you have to like force
[1:10:52] yourself to be kind when you do that
[1:10:53] true you know eventually God will just
[1:10:57] place it in your heart even more and you
[1:10:58] know just you'll just start being more
[1:10:59] and more kind so
[1:11:08] just so yeah that's just what God has
[1:11:10] been showing me the past couple
[1:11:14] weeks God bless
[1:11:22] you
[1:11:27] Andy Reese we're gonna have Brother Andy
[1:11:29] Reese to come up can we make him feel
[1:11:31] welcome
[1:11:35] amen I want to give a little testimony
[1:11:37] real quick while
[1:11:40] um while he gets ready when we were in
[1:11:43] Tucson on the Sunday Night
[1:11:46] Service uh Andy played his special
[1:11:50] Andy and from the moment he hit the
[1:11:53] first notes on the
[1:11:56] saxophone and the piano was
[1:11:58] playing I just felt like that was when I
[1:12:01] had my
[1:12:03] blessing the Holy Ghost just came down
[1:12:05] in such a sweet
[1:12:07] way and everybody knew who was in
[1:12:10] control of that
[1:12:12] service Jehovah Gyra coming
[1:12:19] down speaking to his
[1:12:22] children and
[1:12:24] healing through
[1:12:27] music and I believe he is the same God
[1:12:30] yesterday today and
[1:12:35] forever and he continues to
[1:12:39] heal in many
[1:12:41] ways so if you need
[1:12:44] healing body mind Spirit

[1:12:52] willing to heal us this even

[1:52:18] a while ago
[1:52:23] but I was um I was very sick for a while
[1:52:25] and I was very um I was having DIY
[1:52:31] spells and um I would just had a lot of
[1:52:33] worry on my mind and my
[1:52:37] heart because my daughter was very
[1:52:40] sick and uh she had a a stomach
[1:52:45] problem for months and she would wake up
[1:52:49] every day and she would be nauseous
[1:52:52] and and she was in
[1:52:54] [Music]
[1:52:55] pain and all I could do was just pray
[1:52:58] for
[1:53:00] her and just hold on to the promises of
[1:53:05] God and so we just kept praying and
[1:53:07] praying and it was just months it was
[1:53:09] taking a long
[1:53:13] time but the Lord kept telling me just
[1:53:16] hold on just
[1:53:18] hold
[1:53:21] I've always come through for
[1:53:23] you you know that I'm your
[1:53:27] God so don't doubt me
[1:53:30] now so I just kept
[1:53:34] believing and just praying for my
[1:53:36] daughter and and months kept going by
[1:53:39] and
[1:53:40] by and sister Bonnie checked her
[1:53:44] out and Bonnie said we're going to do
[1:53:46] certain
[1:53:47] things we're going to make some changes
[1:53:51] and we're going to trust in the
[1:53:53] Lord and she's going to be well and I
[1:53:56] believed it I just I I said Lord I know
[1:53:59] you're going to take care of take care
[1:54:01] of her like you always
[1:54:04] have it's just another
[1:54:07] trial so we just kept
[1:54:10] believing and um just like a few months
[1:54:12] ago a couple months
[1:54:14] ago um she started to feel
[1:54:17] better and she said Mom I'm feeling good
[1:54:19] I need to take the
[1:54:22] medicine and she started eating you know
[1:54:24] different things that she couldn't
[1:54:27] eat and that was a real
[1:54:31] test and I kept asking are you okay are
[1:54:33] are you
[1:54:35] fine said Mom I'm fine I'm Healed
[1:54:39] mom I said yes you are and I I just I
[1:54:43] was so grateful to
[1:54:46] God it's hard to be sick for a long time
[1:54:51] I know she suffered a
[1:54:53] lot and um the relief that I felt when
[1:54:56] she said I I'm fine
[1:55:01] Mom it just it took a burden off of
[1:55:05] me and I just I felt I just felt
[1:55:09] joy and then at the same time right
[1:55:12] after
[1:55:14] that um I started to feel better
[1:55:18] myself
[1:55:20] and the the dizzy spells that I was
[1:55:24] having I would I would close my eyes and
[1:55:26] the room would Spin and spin and
[1:55:29] spin and I I think I was just um just
[1:55:33] super you know nervous and worried about
[1:55:36] my
[1:55:39] daughter I think maybe that was causing
[1:55:41] it I don't know
[1:55:43] but but the Lord took with that away and
[1:55:46] I I'm been totally
[1:55:48] fine so God still does his work and and
