[0:00] wanted to continue this morning with
[0:01] nothing but scriptures but
[0:04] i felt it necessary or better to be able
[0:06] to go back and read
[0:09] those things
[0:10] that the prophet of our age left us
[0:13] william branham
[0:14] people that are visiting us we welcome
[0:17] you and
[0:18] we want to tell you that uh
[0:21] that we believe that god has sent a
[0:23] prophet
[0:25] therefore when i read and i say
[0:28] thus saith the prophet i'm referring to
[0:31] the prophet of this age whose name is
[0:33] william branham
[0:35] therefore
[0:36] i believe that if we can see some small
[0:39] things here
[0:41] they will be of great benefit for us
[0:45] i also want to tell you that uh
[0:48] brother jose hernandez enrique and i
[0:50] send their greetings to you i saw them
[0:52] in nogales
[0:55] he asked they asked me to greet each and
[0:57] every one of you and i believe brother
[0:58] foster was here on wednesday and brother
[1:00] tommy
[1:01] they have returned home and we pray
[1:04] to god for both brothers
[1:07] whether it be brother foster brother
[1:08] thomas and brother brother jose and
[1:10] brother nyaya
[1:11] for each one of the ministers that are
[1:13] out there working i'm going to begin to
[1:15] read
[1:16] on page 66
[1:18] of the seals
[1:20] in english
[1:22] it's page 82.
[1:24] the thought
[1:26] in which i have been meditating on is
[1:28] this
[1:29] a man
[1:30] completely
[1:32] surrendered
[1:33] to god
[1:34] is omnipotent i would like to say
[1:38] i sincerely believe that
[1:40] through the message
[1:42] we've proved this
[1:44] that there was a man
[1:45] that surrendered completely and totally
[1:48] to god
[1:49] that man was a prisoner of jesus christ
[1:53] that man is william branham that's the
[1:55] reason why many people
[1:58] mistaken him
[2:01] with the lord jesus christ because it
[2:04] was a man totally surrendered to god
[2:08] however
[2:10] even though we know that william branham
[2:12] was a man completely surrendered to god
[2:14] i believe that each and every one of us
[2:18] need to be
[2:19] and be
[2:22] completely surrendered to god
[2:25] in order to be in the resurrection
[2:29] there's no way that none of us
[2:32] will be in the resurrection
[2:34] if we are not completely surrendered
[2:38] to god
[2:40] that is where i believe that the people
[2:44] converts or changes
[2:46] they place william branham in a separate
[2:49] place totally separate plate from place
[2:51] from us
[2:52] i was searching for the word deity and
[2:56] i don't know how to say it in english
[2:58] the word deity
[3:00] in english
[3:02] more or less is spelled like this
[3:04] deity right
[3:06] but then there's another thing there
[3:09] around there and uh
[3:10] i don't know how to spell it perhaps
[3:13] it's like this
[3:14] d-e-i-s-m-dism
[3:27] deity means having the divine nature
[3:31] this other word deism is having a
[3:34] personal god
[3:37] therefore
[3:38] that god which we have is excluded from
[3:42] human contact
[3:44] it seems like that word is synonymous
[3:48] with the word atheist
[3:50] an atheist is one who does not believe
[3:52] in god atheism
[3:53] [Music]
[3:55] therefore there are people
[3:58] that say they believe in god but they
[4:00] place god in a place
[4:04] really
[4:05] far away and separated from humans
[4:08] and you might say no brother that's the
[4:10] denomination denominations to do that
[4:11] but amongst us it seems like we want to
[4:13] place william branham in a place
[4:16] completely separate from us
[4:18] or a different status than us but the
[4:20] only way that we can be where william
[4:21] branham is at is if we follow the
[4:23] footsteps that william branham has
[4:25] taught us or left
[4:26] behind if he was a man completely
[4:29] surrendered to god then we brother
[4:31] poncho we need to be completely
[4:33] surrendered
[4:35] to god
[4:37] now that's the thought which i will be
[4:39] bringing forth remember
[4:42] a man completely surrendered
[4:45] to god is omnipotent
[4:49] i might not be able to
[4:51] get to where i want to because there's
[4:52] limits this morning but i had a dream
[4:55] which was a pretty mysterious stream
[4:57] this morning and
[4:59] it's been several days
[5:01] [Music]
[5:03] that i haven't i haven't even had an
[5:05] opportunity to come visit my mother you
[5:06] know i visit her daily i don't even have
[5:08] time to see her i haven't had time to
[5:10] see her and i've been worried
[5:13] quite a bit
[5:15] on this on this movement
[5:18] that is around us that surrounds us the
[5:20] election that will be going
[5:22] forth here
[5:25] and also the wedding sup uh uh
[5:28] communion
[5:29] and other things and then also the
[5:31] brothers that have come brother fermin
[5:33] and them and brother tommy who's also
[5:34] coming
[5:36] and trying to
[5:37] receive
[5:38] something on behalf of god and what it
[5:40] is that i must do in all things
[5:42] because you see it's really easy to do
[5:44] say and work
[5:46] but
[5:47] to be in the perfect will of god that's
[5:49] a whole different matter so i was
[5:52] dreaming this morning
[5:55] and in this dream
[5:57] one of my one of our brothers who's here
[6:00] present
[6:01] [Music]
[6:02] while we were worshiping god praying to
[6:05] god in the dream he brought forth a
[6:08] message of prophecy
[6:10] and in this message
[6:12] the message said that god
[6:15] wanted
[6:17] that
[6:18] wanted us to carry out some prayer
[6:21] services
[6:22] notice now
[6:23] and it seems that could it be possible
[6:27] maybe i ate too much last night or what
[6:29] have you
[6:30] because i have already called the people
[6:32] to
[6:33] fasting and prayer
[6:35] i would like to say that wednesday
[6:37] at night
[6:40] we convocated the people to a prayer
[6:43] chain for 24 hours a day
[6:45] and a fasting force
[6:48] for an entire week
[6:50] and the first case that we presented was
[6:52] brother jose
[6:54] so that they could cancel
[6:55] the day that he had been
[6:58] given to
[6:59] be executed and god answered our prayer
[7:02] amen
[7:03] but i want us to continue so that
[7:06] god can absolve him from all things
[7:09] someone might say well brother garcia
[7:11] he's asking a lot well i don't think i
[7:13] ask enough
[7:14] so we need to pray more brothers i
[7:16] believe
[7:18] that
[7:19] if we're waiting for something
[7:22] we're going to receive what we wait for
[7:24] or what we expect the bible says that
[7:26] for everyone that asketh receiveth and
[7:28] he that seeketh findeth and to him that
[7:31] knocketh it shall be opened the bible
[7:33] says that jesus said ye have not because
[7:35] ye ask not and you ask and receive not
[7:38] because you ask amiss that you may
[7:39] consume it upon your lusts
[7:42] so much that we hear and especially
[7:46] the more people
[7:47] that come to be with us there's going to
[7:50] be more problems and the only way that
[7:52] the problems are going to be resolved is
[7:53] if the people unite
[7:56] if the people can come under one mind
[7:59] completely surrender to god so that god
[8:01] can work
[8:02] through his
[8:04] word
[8:06] because his word is what
[8:09] should be guiding us
[8:10] there's no other thing which should
[8:12] guide us
[8:14] and i would like to say that the word
[8:15] the written word
[8:17] we have had it here for thousands of
[8:20] years
[8:21] nevertheless in this time
[8:24] a man came by the name of william
[8:25] branham
[8:27] who brought us in this 20th century
[8:30] not the written word
[8:32] but the spoken word
[8:35] and he taught us what we can be
[8:38] if we surrender completely to god
[8:42] how many believe that the word that
[8:43] brother branham brought is our law
[8:48] so happens that there are churches
[8:51] they've had different people that move
[8:55] to their city
[8:57] where they live and no one no one thinks
[8:59] evil
[9:00] and some time ago
[9:02] when some brothers were coming from
[9:06] nogales the people were shocked
[9:10] they were marveled and they would say
[9:12] why is it that they're going from
[9:14] nogales to phoenix
[9:16] when tucson is right there 60 miles
[9:19] north of
[9:20] nogales is tucson
[9:22] but at the same time they've never
[9:24] stopped to notice that there are people
[9:26] that live in phoenix that every sunday
[9:29] go all the way to tucson
[9:31] well why are they going to tucson being
[9:33] that there's a church here in phoenix so
[9:36] there should be something
[9:38] an attraction
[9:40] that there is in phoenix and the people
[9:42] have not found out
[9:43] that even satan if you don't notice if
[9:46] you notice satan's going to use you
[9:48] so that you are against phoenix and if
[9:51] you without knowing it you are against
[9:53] god i'm going to repeat it again
[9:56] because you see
[9:57] someone moves to another city and nobody
[10:00] says nothing
[10:01] but as soon as they mention that they're
[10:03] going to be moving to phoenix right away
[10:06] a lot of contrary things are spoken
[10:08] about and don't tell me no because i
[10:10] have followed those footsteps how many
[10:12] believe that what william branham said
[10:15] is fulfilled
[10:16] how many of you believe that you are in
[10:18] the message believe that william branham
[10:20] made a mistake how many believe that
[10:22] what william brown said is fulfilled to
[10:24] the t
[10:25] or to the letter
[10:27] let me read you a quote
[10:29] entitled expectations and what is love
[10:33] this is tape number 354
[10:35] the prophet is speaking
[10:37] concerning
[10:39] the uh the magi or the wise men that
[10:42] came from the east and how it is that
[10:45] they were in an observable observatory
[10:48] waiting for that eastern star
[10:51] and in every city there was an
[10:53] observatory
[10:55] it's it's a tower where the wise men
[10:57] would look at the stars by night to see
[11:00] what time of the day
[11:02] it was or what time of the night it was
[11:04] and even though this eastern star
[11:06] appeared the prophet said
[11:08] no observatory saw that star
[11:11] except those three wise men
[11:15] because they
[11:16] were expecting
[11:18] that star
[11:20] the prophet says in that message that
[11:22] the only way that you can receive
[11:23] something is if you're waiting
[11:26] and expecting the prophet says this they
[11:29] were watching
[11:31] for it
[11:35] i'm waiting for something
[11:37] how about you
[11:38] my
[11:41] my soul is stimulated to the highest
[11:43] just before
[11:44] the coming of the lord jesus
[11:48] you see to see
[11:50] something happen
[11:51] that's going to shake the gentile world
[11:55] before god leaves it
[11:58] yes i'm expecting it in phoenix
[12:02] i'm
[12:03] expecting it
[12:05] i'm looking for it i want you to agree
[12:07] with me and expect it
[12:10] no that's not a quote of brother soto
[12:14] this is the word
[12:16] by word for word what the prophet
[12:18] brought and
[12:21] it doesn't matter if you get upset
[12:23] we only need one man to believe it
[12:27] and i believe it
[12:30] i believe
[12:31] maybe there might be someone there that
[12:33] believes it right
[12:35] so
[12:36] the only thing that is needed
[12:38] is a total
[12:40] surrendering
[12:42] so that god can effectuate or bring
[12:45] forth his word or manifest his word i'm
[12:48] going to read in page 66 the prophet
[12:50] says this
[12:52] before
[12:54] the fall
[12:55] there was no tree never died before adam
[12:58] and a animal wouldn't die before adam
[13:01] and there's only one thing that cannot
[13:03] die and that's god because he's eternal
[13:06] and that's the only way we can ever keep
[13:09] from dying we have to have eternal life
[13:12] in us
[13:13] to be
[13:14] sons and daughters
[13:16] of
[13:18] god is that correct that's the only way
[13:22] i was
[13:23] listening to a tape
[13:25] and i forget the name of the tape
[13:27] but the prophet
[13:29] says
[13:30] it's not to stop drink smoking
[13:33] or drinking liquor
[13:35] because you see a man can do this
[13:38] he can impose this upon him it's an
[13:41] he can force himself to do this
[13:43] according to his criteria
[13:46] and what he has tried to do he he says
[13:48] i'll not smoke again and he doesn't
[13:50] smoke he says but what it is
[13:52] it's to receive a person
[13:55] and that person
[13:56] is the person of the lord jesus christ
[14:00] the prophet says
[14:02] that in order for there to be a person
[14:04] you need that person needs to have a
[14:06] personality
[14:08] and when you receive
[14:10] this person
[14:12] you
[14:13] have to have
[14:14] the personality
[14:16] of that person
[14:18] and that personality is
[14:20] eternal life because everything else
[14:22] shall pass away
[14:24] so when you obtain that person
[14:28] that brings forth a complete
[14:31] surrendering to that personality and you
[14:34] can't help it
[14:35] but to tr want to do the will of god
[14:39] which is written
[14:41] in the word
[14:42] and spoken by the prophet of god
[14:46] of this age
[14:47] everything else will pass away brothers
[14:49] it doesn't matter how beautiful
[14:51] something looks
[14:52] this tabernacle it could have
[14:55] a thousand people
[14:57] but if it's not based or founded on the
[15:00] word no matter how beautiful it is it'll
[15:02] stay there
[15:05] it could be
[15:06] it could be the ridicule or mockery of
[15:09] humanity
[15:10] and even of this whole city and of all
[15:12] the believers just that we're but a few
[15:14] in number but
[15:16] but as long as it's planted on the rock
[15:19] it doesn't matter
[15:21] eternal life is there and that is what
[15:23] we want to give to the people we want to
[15:25] give the people eternal life
[15:27] and the only way that we can do it is
[15:29] guiding them directing them to receive
[15:32] that person of the lord jesus christ
[15:36] in their hearts
[15:37] and that is eternal life
[15:41] the personality of jesus christ
[15:44] is a
[15:44] beautiful thing
[15:46] you see
[15:48] when you have that everything
[15:51] that is contrary to god is removed all
[15:54] that scandal that comes
[15:56] to be amongst the people
[15:58] and the reason why there's such stuff is
[16:00] because there's no eternal life
[16:02] and if there's no eternal life it's
[16:04] because you haven't received a person
[16:06] then therefore it's
[16:08] your personality how can brother
[16:10] jonathan have my personality he's a
[16:12] person i'm another
[16:14] how can
[16:15] sister josefina
[16:17] think
[16:19] like
[16:20] sister jorgenna
[16:21] when they're two different people
[16:23] the prophet the people say
[16:27] every head is a world i have one thought
[16:29] you have another thought but allow me to
[16:31] tell you when you receive the person of
[16:33] jesus christ there's only one thought
[16:38] there's only one mind
[16:41] and here is the mind of christ
[16:45] anything different to that
[16:48] there's no
[16:51] you must receive the person of jesus
[16:53] christ in order to have eternal life you
[16:55] can say amen to this right brothers
[16:58] i'm going to continue reading
[17:00] same page
[17:01] page 66 in english it's page 82.
[17:05] now of course when adam fell to death he
[17:08] brought death
[17:09] upon all creation now he was given free
[17:14] moral agency
[17:18] in
[17:19] it was given to them just as we so to
[17:22] make a choice therefore each one of us
[17:25] we have free moral agency
[17:27] there's not anything that is forced upon
[17:30] you each one of us we have to choose
[17:34] in like manner as adam each one of us
[17:37] have the right to choose if we're going
[17:39] to go into the tabernacle
[17:41] and we're going to behave the way we
[17:43] should behave everyone has free moral
[17:45] agency for every little thing that we do
[17:49] we all have free moral agency the ladies
[17:52] that are uh
[17:53] not married
[17:54] or single they have their own choosing
[17:57] or their own choice and free moral
[18:00] agency when a boy asks them
[18:03] to say yes or no they have free moral
[18:06] agency you see people have the choice
[18:08] and then that same people are the ones
[18:11] that complain there's no reason to
[18:12] complain that's the reason why the
[18:14] prophet said it's this isn't a
[18:16] denomination he said each one of us has
[18:19] a
[18:20] choice
[18:21] we can choose what place they're going
[18:23] to call their church does that the
[18:25] prophet say that yes and that man should
[18:27] make that his church whether it be an
[18:30] evangelist whether it's an apostle
[18:32] whether it's a prophet whether it's a
[18:34] teacher
[18:36] he has to be in one church
[18:39] anything outside of that is against the
[18:42] word that william branham brought
[18:44] he must have his church and he must
[18:47] support the cause
[18:49] he must pay his tithe
[18:51] he must give an offering and he should
[18:54] back up the pastor 100
[18:58] because there's only one head
[19:00] in a church and that head
[19:03] is the word of god
[19:06] that brought william branham that
[19:08] william branham brought through the
[19:09] pastor is that correct brothers
[19:12] now notice these things we've spoken for
[19:14] for years
[19:16] but it seems like many people have not
[19:18] understood
[19:19] i would like to say and i want you to
[19:20] notice what i'm speaking
[19:22] that a person
[19:24] that doesn't have a place like this
[19:27] i don't know how he can be in the
[19:28] resurrection because the prophet says
[19:30] that it is the pastor the one that leads
[19:33] and guides therefore if there is a
[19:35] ministry of a teacher or evangelist that
[19:38] teacher and evangelist must recognize
[19:40] the pastor because if he doesn't discern
[19:42] the body of the lord how can he then be
[19:45] part of the body because my body
[19:47] discerns my
[19:49] my arm discerns my hand and my arm
[19:52] doesn't take the place of my eye
[19:54] or of the nose or of my mouth
[19:57] but all my entire body is one
[20:01] united as one therefore if we believe
[20:04] the word we are going to place ourselves
[20:08] in obedience to the word
[20:10] if that person
[20:12] if a person has a free moral agency they
[20:14] can decide whether or not they're going
[20:16] to obey the law
[20:18] or the order of the church in this
[20:20] tabernacle and no one forces you to obey
[20:23] it
[20:24] but since this church has made a
[20:26] decision
[20:27] to be a church a group of believers
[20:30] she also the church also has free moral
[20:32] agency and her free moral agency
[20:36] that she's taken is that if someone
[20:38] doesn't obey the law well they can be
[20:40] dismissed and send him home until he
[20:43] learns to subject himself to the law of
[20:46] this tabernacle
[20:49] can you say man brothers
[20:51] because it seems like
[20:53] it's the battle of armageddon here i
[20:55] would like to say that
[20:57] i have three deacons and we're gonna put
[20:59] four more
[21:00] i'd like to say that the law
[21:02] or the execution of those deacons is the
[21:05] supreme word of this tabernacle
[21:08] and i don't want anyone
[21:10] to mistreat
[21:11] my police officers
[21:13] because someone will tell me brother
[21:16] it's just that i do this and that
[21:18] well
[21:19] you have free moral agency to do
[21:21] whatever you want
[21:23] but i
[21:24] i want you to listen closely
[21:26] the deacons also have the authority of
[21:28] god
[21:29] of the prophet of the word
[21:31] and of this church
[21:33] to
[21:34] jail anyone who is contrary to the word
[21:37] of this church not only with a literal
[21:40] jail but also in chains
[21:42] which are
[21:43] bound
[21:44] those people that are bound those people
[21:46] that are souls in prison that can't be
[21:49] set free
[21:51] see the people have not never been able
[21:53] to understand what the sovereignty of a
[21:55] church a local church is it has
[21:58] authority supreme authority you can do
[22:00] and undo whatever you want to
[22:02] as long as there's no law but as soon as
[22:04] law is applied then you'll stop going
[22:06] around the way you are and i want all of
[22:08] the police officers in this church to
[22:10] apply the law it seems like when the
[22:12] police officers start to apply the law
[22:13] it seems that the people think that they
[22:16] are our enemies oh no apply it even
[22:18] harder as brother galdona said a squeeze
[22:21] is a squeeze
[22:22] it's not just oh my brother no no no
[22:25] squeeze on it
[22:27] and grab him by the by the neck
[22:31] i've always said that there's no devil
[22:32] or a person in this world that brother
[22:34] garcia is afraid of
[22:35] but i stay on my territory
[22:37] i'm not gonna go to someone to satan's
[22:40] territory but here in my territory
[22:43] whoever comes may come
[22:45] i know where i'm standing and i have all
[22:47] of heaven backing me up therefore so do
[22:50] the police officers are you
[22:51] understanding me
[22:53] therefore
[22:54] there's free moral agency you say well i
[22:56] i don't obey the law of the tabernacle
[22:59] well that's your right to disobey
[23:01] but it's also our right to cast you out
[23:03] all right did you hear me right to cast
[23:05] you out
[23:06] and don't you leave go and say oh those
[23:08] brothers don't show love
[23:09] no no brothers this is free moral agency
[23:11] oh brother armando you're gonna marry me
[23:13] sister don't marry sister gloria marry
[23:15] this other lady over here oh i'm gonna
[23:17] marry whoever she wants to well she
[23:19] liked he liked the little dark one so
[23:21] he's gonna marry the dark one well
[23:22] that's the way you are if you want some
[23:23] other kind of church you can choose it
[23:26] but if you choose this church as your
[23:28] church your responsibility is to back
[23:30] your church and obey the laws that are
[23:33] within this church
[23:35] free moral agency i'll put that to the
[23:38] side
[23:39] now
[23:40] back there in the beginning with adam
[23:41] and eve
[23:42] in the beginning there was a tree of
[23:45] right and wrong before them
[23:48] and that same tree sets before
[23:52] each and every one of us
[23:54] you hear me edward edward
[23:56] this
[23:57] tree of the good and evil is before you
[24:00] it is before me it is before you it's
[24:02] before brother paul it's before
[24:04] each and every one of us and since we're
[24:07] under free moral agency we can choose to
[24:09] do
[24:10] good or evil
[24:12] why is there why is there so many
[24:14] difficulties because the majority of the
[24:15] people choose to do evil
[24:18] and they want others to follow them to
[24:21] do evil because that false vine is
[24:23] always trying to
[24:25] uh
[24:26] a bend the true vine because both vines
[24:28] are interlaced and it is a continual
[24:31] fight between
[24:32] the true vine and the false find and the
[24:34] false fine
[24:36] are are those that or those that belong
[24:37] to that vine they choose to do evil but
[24:40] those that choose those that are of god
[24:42] they choose to do good sister margie
[24:44] nobody's chose forcing you to do one
[24:46] thing or the other
[24:48] you remember the anecdote that i uh like
[24:50] to speak on that the one the brother
[24:53] that would always say the devil was
[24:54] chasing him you remember that
[24:56] there's people new there's new people
[24:58] here that don't know that story well
[24:59] there so happens there was a brother
[25:00] that every service he'd get up in the
[25:02] middle of services the brothers pray for
[25:04] me because last night that devil was
[25:06] really after me
[25:08] and the whole congregation is praying
[25:09] for him well it so happens that one day
[25:11] at nighttime
[25:12] a brother saw a brother from the church
[25:14] saw him and he said oh there goes my
[25:16] poor brother i'm going to follow him
[25:18] because the devil's always chasing him
[25:21] and when the devil begins to chase him
[25:23] i'm going to help my brother so he
[25:24] follows him right he follows him from
[25:26] afar and that man goes to a little place
[25:30] and where there was it was dark they
[25:32] turned off the lights and
[25:34] and there he was they had they turned
[25:36] the lights off and he knocked on the
[25:37] door gently when he knocked on the door
[25:40] someone opened the door they saw him
[25:43] they went back inside
[25:46] into the house and they came back out
[25:48] and gave him a little bag
[25:49] that brother was carried the bag with
[25:51] him and he began to walk down the street
[25:54] and every few steps
[25:56] he would tip something
[25:59] that was in that little bag he would
[26:01] tips it well it was a bottle of liquor
[26:04] and a few blocks later that brother was
[26:08] always complaining the devil was chasing
[26:09] him was was was zig-zagging all over the
[26:11] place like a snake
[26:13] next service the brother stands up again
[26:16] you know the little drunk guy he says
[26:17] brothers please pray for me the devil
[26:18] was chasing me last night but the other
[26:20] brother to follow him said no brothers
[26:21] please don't pray for him because last
[26:23] night the devil was asleep and our
[26:25] brother went to go wake him up
[26:27] therefore
[26:29] before us
[26:30] lies good and evil
[26:32] and many people say brother pray for me
[26:34] but they never pray for themselves
[26:36] because the evil is there and they
[26:38] choose to do bad and wrong and evil but
[26:41] then they want all the congregation to
[26:42] be praying for them
[26:44] so that he doesn't do evil when the
[26:46] other man when he the man is always
[26:48] choosing to do evil now if a brother
[26:50] falls into a trap of the devil
[26:52] and if he's trapped and he asks for help
[26:54] that's a whole different matter but i'm
[26:55] talking about that man that continually
[26:57] brother pray for me so that god can uh
[27:00] god take this desire of smoking away
[27:03] and you you have a pouch a cigarette
[27:05] here and rolling papers over here and
[27:06] yeah all the time he takes out your
[27:08] cigarette and you smoke it and
[27:10] oh
[27:11] when will god take this desire away well
[27:13] how is god going to do it
[27:16] there's people that say
[27:17] oh brother pray for me but so that god
[27:19] can uh
[27:21] stop me from cussing
[27:23] brothers before each and every one is
[27:24] evil and good is before us no one's
[27:26] pushing you or forcing you
[27:28] or taking these men with a shotgun and
[27:31] takes them to the bar
[27:33] is there a deacon here that's chasing
[27:35] you and forcing you to speak evil of
[27:37] your brother is there someone brothers
[27:39] i'd like to know so that i can call the
[27:41] deacons
[27:43] therefore before us lies good and evil
[27:46] we are under free moral agency
[27:48] in like manner as were adam and eve the
[27:51] prophet says i'll continue reading you
[27:53] say well
[27:55] it's their fault
[27:56] and that's what the people say they
[27:58] always blame adam and eve no he says
[28:01] he said well i wouldn't be in the
[28:02] condition i was in if it weren't for
[28:03] adam and eve they say
[28:05] brother brown says
[28:06] well it's their fault no brother brown
[28:08] says no not now it isn't
[28:11] it's
[28:12] not now it's not adam and eve's fault
[28:14] it's your fault
[28:15] you can't blame
[28:18] or place it on adam now
[28:23] you can't place it
[28:25] on adam now
[28:28] you can't place it on adam now
[28:31] you've got to place it on yourself
[28:34] you've got to put the blame on yourself
[28:37] because that's where right and wrong is
[28:39] at brothers that's where the wrong thing
[28:41] is at that's where the wrong thing is
[28:43] the prophet gives us the prescription
[28:46] and we preach and we believe that the
[28:48] brother the message of the prophet but
[28:50] not only the laity but also the ministry
[28:51] but the ministry they're the first ones
[28:53] that transgress or break the word
[28:55] now i'm not speaking locally i'm
[28:57] speaking worldwide they infringe break
[29:01] transgress the word of god
[29:03] notice you brother brown says you got to
[29:06] place it on yourself personally
[29:08] look for a brother
[29:10] for you to understand me a brother has a
[29:11] bad temper and then he says well it's
[29:13] just that paul little paul he just he
[29:16] just pokes at me oh jonathan he provokes
[29:19] me
[29:20] and i i'm just short tempered
[29:22] well it's a saying without
[29:24] it's a mexican i must i'm short-tempered
[29:27] man and i just can't take it
[29:29] you have to accept the blame personally
[29:32] don't blame paul or jonathan
[29:35] blame yourself
[29:37] because you're short-tempered
[29:40] you are to blame
[29:42] now that's the thing brothers
[29:45] that sincerely has brought
[29:48] a great
[29:50] error or failure
[29:52] people take this message
[29:55] as an intellectual message
[29:57] a minister should not bring this message
[30:01] first of all
[30:02] unless they die and are born again you
[30:04] must accept
[30:06] the blame personally as long as you
[30:08] don't accept that you're so tempered
[30:10] jealous
[30:11] envious
[30:13] you cannot find relief from that do you
[30:15] believe that a man or woman they're
[30:17] jealous are going to be in the
[30:18] resurrection and i'm now i'm talking i'm
[30:20] speaking you know what i'm talking about
[30:21] right that's a excessive jealousy
[30:24] uh do you believe that a short-tempered
[30:26] man is going to be in the resurrection
[30:28] oh someone might say oh but jesus got
[30:31] angry
[30:32] did you know jesus got angry
[30:34] but
[30:34] when did jesus get angry when they
[30:37] brought the children to him for example
[30:39] and he began to bless them and to take
[30:41] him in his arms and bless them
[30:43] and then the apostles or someone said
[30:45] why why does he do that look at all the
[30:47] time you waste with those little kids
[30:49] and and we're we're big and we've been
[30:51] with you day and night and you don't
[30:53] even glance at us
[30:55] jesus the bible says that jesus got
[30:56] angry well if you get angry if you meet
[30:59] the same conditions that's fine
[31:00] if you if you get angry because the
[31:02] people don't obey the word and the
[31:04] church order that's okay if you get
[31:06] angry because your wife wants to be on
[31:08] top of you stepping on top of you well
[31:10] that's okay
[31:11] that's what many happens with the
[31:12] prophet the prophet says the prophet
[31:14] says
[31:15] the woman misbehaves and then the man
[31:17] says oh
[31:18] god bless you my pleasure starling god
[31:20] bless you
[31:21] and then the woman cast him outside the
[31:24] man says god bless you honey i'll i'll
[31:26] come back
[31:27] he says what you need is a backbone not
[31:29] a wishbone
[31:30] there's the correct anger
[31:33] when you broke
[31:34] when the word is broken we must be
[31:36] jealous and zealous of the word with
[31:38] knowledge
[31:40] the the jealousy or zealous must be
[31:42] according to knowledge not without
[31:44] knowledge but each and every one of us
[31:45] have to accept our blame personally
[31:50] because before each and every one of you
[31:52] is good and evil
[31:56] in the same way as it was placed before
[31:59] them that was the third thing how many
[32:01] of you have been redeemed by the blood
[32:03] of the lamb
[32:04] let's see raise your hand
[32:05] very well
[32:06] how many have not been been redeemed by
[32:08] the blood of the lamb
[32:10] how many new people do we have here how
[32:11] many of you have not been redeemed by
[32:13] the blood of the lamb all of you one two
[32:18] four once again how many of you have
[32:20] been redeemed by the blood of the lamb
[32:24] thank you
[32:27] when a now
[32:28] been redeemed
[32:30] he don't care anymore for scholarships
[32:34] he don't care for any more of the things
[32:35] of the world
[32:37] the wisdom of the world he don't want no
[32:40] choice at all
[32:42] christ
[32:43] has been his choice
[32:46] you see
[32:47] when you've been redeemed it's because
[32:49] you have chosen christ
[32:52] you say no one can force you you
[32:54] yourself must choose christ
[32:57] you understand me victory brother pancho
[33:00] you understand you must choose christ
[33:03] and when you've been redeemed the
[33:04] prophet says
[33:06] christ has been your choice
[33:10] and that's all of it
[33:12] he's redeemed he's just no more wants to
[33:14] lead himself
[33:16] although this is tremendous what if paul
[33:18] chose mary why would he be looking for
[33:20] another young lady
[33:22] to choose he already chose is that right
[33:24] brothers
[33:26] therefore when you have chosen christ
[33:29] there's
[33:30] there's no one else to choose because
[33:32] now there's two the prophet says in each
[33:34] one of you there's an election
[33:37] three they're voting
[33:39] i voted once that was for christ i got
[33:41] to win the devil voted against me
[33:44] and christ voted for me depends on which
[33:47] way i cast my vote
[33:49] so if you have chosen god or voted for
[33:52] christ there's no other choice to make
[33:55] what happens with many of us is that we
[33:57] say that we have chosen chosen christ
[33:59] but we're not satisfied it's like that
[34:02] brother that uh this is true brothers
[34:04] they tell me it's true they said a
[34:06] brother was praying and said lord sucker
[34:09] me
[34:10] which means help me he wanted to get
[34:11] married sucker me lord and so happens
[34:14] that he married a girl by the name of
[34:15] socorro and she was fatter than me and
[34:18] said lord i asked you for a soccorro or
[34:20] sucker and you gave me a big huge sucker
[34:22] me
[34:24] see he wasn't satisfied
[34:26] so a lot of people have said that
[34:28] they've chosen christ but they're not
[34:29] satisfied to follow christ
[34:32] because christ is the anointed word
[34:35] and to be able to to be able to be
[34:37] correctly placed you must be obeying the
[34:40] word and the word must be living through
[34:42] you we must be satisfied because we have
[34:45] made this choice the prophet says
[34:49] everything was finished there when you
[34:51] chose he is redeemed
[34:53] he no longer wants to lead himself
[34:55] brother leyva
[34:57] he don't want nobody to talk to him
[35:00] where to go and what to do
[35:03] he just waits and finds out the choice
[35:08] of
[35:09] his maker
[35:11] see
[35:12] he doesn't want nobody to tell him
[35:14] many are bear are still married with the
[35:16] denomination
[35:18] others are married with the church
[35:20] others are married with an individual
[35:23] but we should be married with christ the
[35:25] word
[35:27] that should be our choice and our
[35:30] decision brother oh bernie you're
[35:32] contradicting yourself no i'm in the
[35:34] word
[35:36] well no you just contradict what you say
[35:37] a few moments ago no because in the word
[35:39] there's an order a five-fold ministry
[35:42] for the perfection of the church
[35:45] but it has to be within the word
[35:48] the pastor just as much as the teacher
[35:51] or the prophet
[35:52] because there are still prophets okay
[35:55] but major prophet there's only one and
[35:57] that's william branham
[36:00] that's where all choosing and election
[36:02] has finished
[36:04] there's
[36:05] there's no point in choosing any other
[36:06] brother johnson there's no point in
[36:08] going out to see
[36:10] how i feel this morning to see if i feel
[36:12] good enough to pray to god or feel good
[36:14] enough to hear a tape or read a book or
[36:17] to hear tape or to praise god i i want
[36:20] to see who i feel like doing it no no no
[36:22] no you you've got no choice left
[36:25] just as we get up in the morning
[36:28] rubbing our eye our little eye crusts
[36:31] and
[36:31] and eating eggs with potatoes and
[36:34] tortillas and chili we have made our
[36:36] choice for christ
[36:39] we should get up
[36:40] meditating on christ
[36:42] reading the books
[36:44] hearing the tapes
[36:45] taking the bible
[36:48] because that has been our choosing day
[36:51] and night
[36:52] blessed is the man
[36:54] that meditates on the law of god by day
[36:58] and night
[36:59] this isn't the halfway thing brothers
[37:01] this has been your choice there's
[37:03] nothing else to choose but to get up in
[37:06] the morning
[37:07] amen
[37:08] if we could all get up in the morning
[37:10] thinking about the word
[37:12] meditating on the message meditating on
[37:15] christ meditating on the messenger of
[37:17] the age
[37:18] we would behave a little different to
[37:21] the way we normally behave
[37:23] but there you are like uh
[37:28] like those that had one foot in and one
[37:29] foot out but christ
[37:31] calls those that have one foot in one
[37:33] foot out adulterers he wants someone to
[37:36] serve him and him alone
[37:38] and may not may they not be flirting
[37:40] with the world because there's a lot of
[37:41] people in this church there are a bunch
[37:43] of flirts many flirts in this message
[37:46] as soon as a brother or the sister
[37:47] doesn't watch it
[37:49] and they look at the world hello baby
[37:51] they tell the world hello baby
[37:54] you might say no
[37:56] you should measure the words that you
[37:57] have spoken during the week see how many
[37:59] spokens
[38:01] see how many words that you spoke would
[38:02] be accepted or rejected by christ oh you
[38:05] should see how i can't stand those
[38:06] deacons that lalo i can't even see him
[38:09] in on in a drawing or a painting that
[38:11] other one alex much less romero who
[38:14] forget about it
[38:16] and it's worse now that they put a
[38:18] couple of uh of gunmen there on the
[38:20] sides
[38:22] i'm sure that many of you have said that
[38:24] during the week oh well i thought
[38:26] brother garcia was going to preach the
[38:27] word
[38:28] look what you look what he's got here
[38:29] now notice now
[38:31] these are people that are one foot in
[38:33] and one foot out
[38:35] and that is the people that are always
[38:37] pointing and complaining the prophet
[38:38] said all those that are pointing nine
[38:40] times out of ten they're the ones to
[38:41] blame because one finger is pointing
[38:43] that way and three are pointing right
[38:45] back at you
[38:47] you should accept your blame personally
[38:50] what is what we need here in this
[38:51] tabernacle
[38:56] what i need to do is to be born again
[38:58] and you must say father here i am i
[39:01] surrender completely to you i i give
[39:04] myself completely to you that's what
[39:06] there should be most of in tab in the
[39:07] tabernacle like crying a clammer a cry
[39:12] don't you think you're going to be born
[39:13] again on a flowery bed of ease how many
[39:16] women here have given birth
[39:18] has there been women here who have given
[39:20] birth raise your hand when you gave
[39:21] birth you were smiling and all happy
[39:23] right drinking a coke and pepsi
[39:26] no there was pain there was groaning
[39:29] there was crying
[39:31] do you think
[39:32] that the birth is going to be anything
[39:35] different no sir
[39:36] to be born again you need to groan
[39:40] you need to cry out you need you need to
[39:42] cry the prophet says that the church
[39:45] should
[39:46] be giving birth
[39:48] a woman the prophet says there's many
[39:50] women
[39:52] in this day
[39:53] they don't want to give birth anymore
[39:55] because they don't want to lose their
[39:57] shape
[39:57] isn't that what the prophet says
[40:00] and there's many churches brothers that
[40:01] don't want to give birth because they
[40:03] don't want to lose their shape or their
[40:04] form they need to lose their shape they
[40:07] need to get a little
[40:09] belly
[40:10] and when that stomach is all stretched
[40:12] out they can't help it anymore because
[40:14] they know that if they don't have birth
[40:16] pains they're always going to be with
[40:18] that big belly there and they begin to
[40:20] cry out and they begin to cry out and
[40:22] they begin to look for the face of god
[40:24] saying lord i want to give birth
[40:27] and the more the closer the time comes
[40:30] the pains the birth pains are harder but
[40:32] once that child is born that mother
[40:35] takes that child and begins to rejoice
[40:39] that's the reason why the bible states
[40:41] he that goeth forth and weepeth bearing
[40:43] precious seed
[40:45] shall doubtless come again with
[40:47] rejoicing
[40:48] bringing his sheaves with him
[40:50] a church that does not give birth
[40:54] cannot be the church of the living god
[40:57] and in order to give birth you need to
[41:00] be impregnated with the word
[41:03] and the word or
[41:04] orders us that we must be completely
[41:07] surrendered to god
[41:09] a church brothers a man
[41:12] completely surrendered to god
[41:16] okay joanna
[41:18] now adam sinned
[41:21] by heeding his wife's reasoning
[41:23] instead of holding to god's word
[41:28] don't listen to the reasoning brothers
[41:30] accept the word of god
[41:32] and the prophet says i don't care who it
[41:35] is whether brother labor or brother
[41:36] burnaby whether it's brother paul
[41:37] brother campo whoever it might be
[41:40] you must come in the same manner that
[41:43] every single son of god has come
[41:45] a new birth
[41:47] a total surrendering
[41:49] not something intellectual no sir
[41:53] you must receive the person of jesus
[41:56] christ within you
[41:57] so that he can change your personality
[42:00] totally
[42:01] don't listen to your reasoning
[42:03] reasoning will tell you look you already
[42:05] accepted malachi 4. you pentecost you
[42:07] already went through pentecost you don't
[42:09] need this
[42:11] allow me to tell you that that's
[42:12] reasoning
[42:13] because the prophet said
[42:16] that the first doctrine that jesus
[42:18] taught was the doctrine or the main
[42:20] doctrine was ye must be born again
[42:24] the prophet said that a church that has
[42:26] no doctrine is not a church
[42:30] he says that a ministry that has no
[42:32] doctrine is no ministry
[42:34] no wreath don't reason but take the
[42:37] place of the word
[42:38] that's what adam that's that's the way
[42:40] adam sinned his wife reasoned with satan
[42:44] and then produced the product to adam
[42:46] and adam turned loose the word
[42:50] and sold out
[42:52] he lost also his inheritance
[42:55] when he lost his fellowship
[42:58] and right to life how can two
[43:02] walk together unless they be agreed
[43:05] the ones that are walking together or
[43:07] should be walking together is you and
[43:09] god and he is the word and when you lose
[43:11] your fellowship with god or the word you
[43:14] have lost your inheritance if you have
[43:16] been redeemed how many want your
[43:17] inheritance again brothers we need to be
[43:20] in fellowship with christ the word let
[43:25] us pray divine father
[43:28] we thank you
[43:29] for your word
[43:32] for every person that's here lord
[43:35] help us to be
[43:37] faithful to it your word
[43:42] may we stay lord
[43:45] planted and rooted in the word
[43:48] [Music]
[43:49] it matters not how much we are
[43:51] criticized or how we're scoffed or how
[43:54] much we're mocked but we will stay
[43:57] on the side of your word and if we do so
[43:59] we will have eternal life and that is
[44:01] what we desire lord to have fellowship
[44:03] with you
[44:05] so that we can be
[44:07] heirs of the inheritance which you have
[44:09] left us
[44:11] when you redeemed us we don't want to be
[44:13] like those that have sold their
[44:14] birthright
[44:16] but we want to grab a hold of it
[44:19] we don't want to
[44:21] set loose your word your prophet said
[44:23] that adam loosed himself from the word
[44:27] but then jacob came and he grabbed a
[44:29] hold of you
[44:31] help us
[44:32] to take you
[44:35] at your word lord
[44:36] to accept it believe it receive it and
[44:39] live it lord
[44:42] in the name
[44:43] of the lord jesus christ
[44:46] amen
[44:53] uh
[45:10] 8 20
