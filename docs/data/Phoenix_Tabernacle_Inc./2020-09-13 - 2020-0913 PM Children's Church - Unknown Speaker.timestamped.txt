[49:48] me it's been a pleasure
[49:49] well welcome professor hello sister
[49:51] joanna and musicians
[49:53] and sister liz over here you guys are
[49:55] awesome how many appreciates our
[49:56] musicians
[49:58] [Applause]
[50:03] we love it and i appreciate you how many
[50:06] of you appreciate you
[50:08] you gotta appreciate you give yourselves
[50:10] the rounds of an applause
[50:12] please
[50:12] [Applause]
[50:16] oh yes we know sometimes it's hard to
[50:20] appreciate ourselves sometimes it's hard
[50:23] to accept that we are awesome
[50:25] but we are and sometimes it's hard to
[50:28] forgive
[50:28] ourselves sometimes it's hard to forgive
[50:31] ourselves for the mistakes we made
[50:33] it's hard enough to forgive other people
[50:36] but
[50:36] when it comes to ourselves sometimes
[50:40] it's even harder to forgive ourselves
[50:43] who knows what i'm talking about like if
[50:46] you're at school
[50:48] and you cheat and you get caught and
[50:50] then you're like i'm the worst kid
[50:52] ever but you're not
[50:56] you just cheated and you need to go to
[50:57] detention and write i will not
[50:59] copy my paper a hundred times
[51:02] no i'm just kidding whatever your
[51:03] teacher says you have to do but we don't
[51:05] cheat do we
[51:07] well not anymore because everybody's at
[51:09] home doing distance learning for the
[51:12] most part
[51:12] but you could always google the answer
[51:14] but that would be cheating too
[51:18] but if you did cheat you have to forgive
[51:22] yourself
[51:23] if you do make a mistake you have to
[51:26] forgive yourself
[51:28] if you do yell at your mom or punch your
[51:31] brother in the face
[51:34] you have to forgive yourself
[51:37] right and then we have to forgive others
[51:41] see there was a man in the bible who had
[51:44] a hard time forgiving somebody
[51:47] his name was philemon
[51:50] not to be mistaken was filet mignon
[51:53] it was philemon but he was a
[51:57] rich man he was very wealthy and
[52:00] we know this possibly because he had
[52:02] slaves
[52:03] so he had servants and he had slaves and
[52:06] he had
[52:07] the fanciest masks for kovitt 19 and
[52:10] then
[52:11] what he also he had a
[52:14] a big house because the apostle paul
[52:17] wrote him a letter and in the letter the
[52:20] apostle paul explained that
[52:21] he had the church in his house so he
[52:24] happened to have a big enough house
[52:26] to host all the people in the church
[52:29] but that man had a slave and that slave
[52:33] betrayed him and he had
[52:36] a very very hard time forgiving
[52:40] that slave i cannot i cannot i cannot
[52:43] believe he would do this to me
[52:45] i trusted him i gave this everything he

[57:51] for all of that it's
[57:53] it's beautiful and all you have to do my
[57:55] friend is
[57:56] accept it let me give you an example
[57:59] of just accepting it let's say there's a
[58:01] book on the floor
[58:03] and it has your name on it i'm getting
[58:06] inspired my friends
[58:08] it has your name on it it says benji
[58:11] garcia
[58:12] this is wait you're a kabil huh a
[58:14] nemesis forgive me
[58:17] i'm thinking all over the place so it
[58:19] has your name on it it says
[58:21] nemesis this book is for you and all you
[58:24] have to do is accept it
[58:26] believe it that's it in the same way
[58:29] with jesus christ
[58:31] he already died you don't have to work
[58:34] for it though
[58:35] i got to do this you believe and repent
[58:38] and get baptized so you can show
[58:41] everybody that i am a christian
[58:43] i don't care what people think it's
[58:47] amazing grace
[58:51] [Music]
[59:10] to the feet of the lord jesus christ and
[59:13] unless he mischanged his ways
[59:16] and he realized that he needed that
[59:18] amazing grace
[59:20] is there somebody that knows they need
[59:22] amazing place
[59:25] as we listen to this beautiful song
[59:28] think about the grace that you need in
[59:31] your life
[59:32] [Music]
[59:40] [Applause]
[59:47] but unless he missed knew there was
[59:49] something he had to do
[59:52] i have to go and ever uh say sorry to my
[59:55] master
[59:56] yes you do you have to say sorry to your
[59:58] master but let me tell you
[1:00:00] i know your master lumen i don't
[1:00:03] remember but let me tell you i will
[1:00:06] write a letter for him
[1:00:07] and i want you to take it can you give
[1:00:09] me some parchment paper and ink
[1:00:12] remember what i told you drink some
[1:00:13] paper okay i got you
[1:00:15] it's over there my friend come on
[1:00:18] so in the bible paul writes
[1:00:22] that onesimus actually helped him
[1:00:25] in the gospel after he got converted
[1:00:28] so we don't really know how because the
[1:00:30] bible doesn't say but if paul was in
[1:00:32] prison
[1:00:32] we imagine that maybe he brought him
[1:00:34] some paper and some pen so he can write
[1:00:36] letters to the churches
[1:00:37] maybe he brought him some figs or
[1:00:41] did you bring the figs my friend hot
[1:00:43] cheetos or something i don't know but
[1:00:44] he helped him
[1:00:49] almost finish here exclamation mark
[1:00:53] period
[1:00:54] question mark two plus two is f what do
[1:00:55] i think oh this is perfect
[1:00:59] thank you you're welcome take care of my
[1:01:02] friend
[1:01:03] so off he went he went
[1:01:07] on a journey he was terrified he didn't
[1:01:09] go so fast because he was actually
[1:01:10] scared he's right now he's skipping
[1:01:12] slow down you are excited but he was
[1:01:14] nervous
[1:01:15] how many have ever had to ask for
[1:01:16] forgiveness before
[1:01:19] how many ever messed up and they had to
[1:01:21] go and say sorry
[1:01:23] do you go like this
[1:01:29] hey what's up i totally did you daddy
[1:01:31] can you forgive me
[1:01:33] no when you're really sorry
[1:01:36] and you're really sorry you go
[1:01:41] like a little puppy with a towel between
[1:01:42] your legs
[1:01:45] and you say i
[1:01:49] i don't
[1:01:53] you know
[1:01:57] but i did it and i'm sorry
[1:02:01] can you forgive me i'll make it right
[1:02:05] that's how we apologize you go you
[1:02:09] acknowledge what you did
[1:02:11] don't just say well you know the blood
[1:02:14] of jesus and if he forgave me who are
[1:02:16] you
[1:02:19] you better forgive me or you're going to
[1:02:20] hey how you doing
[1:02:24] no no no if you're really sorry
[1:02:29] you go and you say i'm sorry like that
[1:02:32] one time bernie was borrowing uncle
[1:02:35] joe's truck remember uncle joe
[1:02:39] bernie don't look at me but bernie
[1:02:42] borrowed uncle joe's truck one sunday
[1:02:44] morning and uncle joe said be careful
[1:02:45] don't crash it
[1:02:46] and bernie's like come on bro
[1:02:49] yeah right i got my driver's license but
[1:02:53] he didn't know what he was doing he was
[1:02:54] a clown i don't know how old he was
[1:02:56] anyways don't look at me don't judge me
[1:02:58] like that bernie
[1:03:00] got in the trunk and he ran into a
[1:03:03] pillar
[1:03:05] but luckily he was on the passenger side
[1:03:08] so when he got in the car
[1:03:10] he didn't see it but then since it was
[1:03:13] sunday morning bernie was sitting right
[1:03:15] here
[1:03:16] and he's like i'm gonna hey
[1:03:19] lord help me you could have something i
[1:03:21] need i need to repent
[1:03:23] i need i need i need to do something
[1:03:27] and something was inside of him because
[1:03:29] he did something wrong and he didn't
[1:03:30] confess
[1:03:32] i know there's a couple of you that
[1:03:33] haven't confessed a few things and i'm
[1:03:35] not going to look at you in the eyes
[1:03:38] but we need to make things right
[1:03:41] so uncle joe was over there playing the
[1:03:43] bass you know praising the lord
[1:03:45] getting his worship on and there goes
[1:03:47] bernie
[1:03:48] um uncle joe
[1:03:51] i gotta tell you something
[1:03:55] you remember your truck
[1:03:59] you know what i'm talking about right um
[1:04:02] yeah
[1:04:02] yeah the only truck you have yes that
[1:04:04] one um
[1:04:05] well remember when you let me borrow it
[1:04:08] yeah like 20 minutes ago yeah
[1:04:11] and you said don't crush it well
[1:04:14] oh i didn't crash it don't go get crazy
[1:04:17] but i
[1:04:18] i did get like a little scratch on the
[1:04:19] side
[1:04:23] can you forgive me i'm sorry
[1:04:26] please forgive me i can't even worship
[1:04:28] the lord i'm sitting in here and i know
[1:04:29] i'm a sinner
[1:04:31] forgive me i have to confess it and he
[1:04:33] just laughed like he did
[1:04:37] oh okay i forgive you go bro when he
[1:04:40] went to go look at it the scratch was
[1:04:41] like that big
[1:04:43] but thank you for forgiving him but he
[1:04:47] made it right
[1:04:48] so we have to make things right as
[1:04:50] embarrassing as it may be
[1:04:52] as hurtful as you think it might be we
[1:04:54] have to make things right so anessimus
[1:04:56] went
[1:04:57] to make things right but he was lucky
[1:05:00] because paul wrote a letter on his
[1:05:02] behalf and he said
[1:05:04] philemon accept my son onesimus
[1:05:08] whom i have begotten in the gospel
[1:05:11] but accept him not as a slave
[1:05:14] except him as a brother
[1:05:18] as a brother in christ for he has the
[1:05:21] same freedom that you do
[1:05:23] and i think he was so beautiful because
[1:05:25] paul even said
[1:05:27] anything he owes you whatever he did to
[1:05:29] you
[1:05:30] put it on my account
[1:05:33] and when i get out of here i'll pay it
[1:05:38] but i think it's cool cause paul also
[1:05:39] said but i'm not gonna mention all that
[1:05:41] you owe me
[1:05:44] read it paul actually said that it was
[1:05:45] cool
[1:05:47] and then what that was
[1:05:50] was a beautiful type brother joseph of
[1:05:53] jesus
[1:05:54] taking on our sin because that's what he
[1:05:57] did
[1:05:58] when satan comes and accuses you brother
[1:06:00] benji
[1:06:01] jesus is actually saying satan
[1:06:04] this is my son who i've begotten in the
[1:06:07] gospel
[1:06:08] he's been born again anything he did put
[1:06:11] it on my account
[1:06:13] and he took that to the cross
[1:06:17] so this is a biblical example of the
[1:06:20] apostle of god
[1:06:22] fulfilling the role of christ for his
[1:06:25] converts and believers
[1:06:28] oh and then the roman soldier thought it
[1:06:31] was so cool he
[1:06:32] asked paul so would you write
[1:06:35] what did i write my oh yes
[1:06:40] what are you writing about oh yes
[1:06:44] i always make copies of my letter this
[1:06:46] will come very in handy
[1:06:47] it's good when you try to defend the
[1:06:49] faith too trust me
[1:06:51] give me the letter so it says
[1:06:54] okay listen up pay attention everybody
[1:06:57] pay attention please
[1:06:58] my dear fell philemon i'm hungry for
[1:07:01] some rabbi
[1:07:02] my dear fellaiman holy man my beloved
[1:07:05] brother
[1:07:06] your faith is strong you are precious
[1:07:10] in the lord i love you my brother and
[1:07:13] every day i think about you
[1:07:15] in my prayers but let me tell you
[1:07:17] something my friend my brother
[1:07:19] or no i was a former servant he
[1:07:23] came to me and i preached the gospel to
[1:07:26] him and now he is my son
[1:07:28] but let me plead something with you my
[1:07:30] friend my brother
[1:07:32] don't take back onesimus as a servant
[1:07:36] take him back as a brother my friend in
[1:07:39] christ because he has accepted jesus
[1:07:42] christ so now we are all
[1:07:44] joint heirs my friend brothers together
[1:07:46] in the gospel
[1:07:48] and anything that he has done wrong to
[1:07:50] you my friend put it on my
[1:07:52] account i will pay for it and don't
[1:07:54] forget to mention what you owe me but
[1:07:55] anyways
[1:07:57] put it on my account my friend
[1:08:00] god bless you and god bless everyone in
[1:08:02] your house what do you think
[1:08:06] i don't think i don't think i would ever
[1:08:07] be able to write something like that so
[1:08:09] i know it's pretty good inspiration of
[1:08:11] god read your scriptures inspiration
[1:08:15] they call me paul the aged for no for
[1:08:17] good reasons too
[1:08:26] the lord and write his letters in prison
[1:08:29] or wherever he was and he made up a
[1:08:32] great portion of the bible
[1:08:35] kids you should go home today and read
[1:08:37] the book of philemon with your parents
[1:08:39] it's only one chapter
