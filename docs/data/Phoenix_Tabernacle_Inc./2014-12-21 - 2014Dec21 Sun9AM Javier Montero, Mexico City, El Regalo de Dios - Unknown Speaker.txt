place of utmost confidence to our associate pastor brother Johnny Alvarado God bless him along with his family and all of the ministry in this presid place thank you for your confidence brother at this at this moment I'm happy because my family accompanies me my loving wife mono my son n and my young Montero and also my father and my my mother-in-law accompan me and my mother-in-law I hope my mother-in-law is there because she had on a doctor's appointment there she is glory to God also my my brothers my brothers Brother Juan Pon and his family my brother J pon they're my family on behalf of my wife God bless them for being here with us and each every one of you that each day I get to know more and more Brethren it's a big family here and at times it's difficult to get to know everyone but every time that the Lord allows me to come I can always get to know someone else and brother I'm speaking all of this because I'm very nervous also because you must give thanks right but I'm also doing it to be able to relax a little bit the that are watching us via the Internet may God bless you one that's watching us via the invisible congregation may God bless you Phoenix if you're watching us via internet and you live in Phoenix and you're at home turn off the computer and get over here you're in Mexico go to your church also right then you can see it later via YouTube re please receive greetings from the church there inapa Mexico there's a great majority of Brethren there that love you not only do they love you but they admire you and they know you you don't know them but they do know you because they see you on the videos and all of a sudden all your face if you're bored or you're happy they can see everything there saying all this please stand let's read the mighty word of God reading two scriptures the first one is in Isaiah 7:14 Isaiah 7:14 you have it brother then it reads therefore the Lord himself shall give you a sign Behold a virgin shall conceive and bear a son and shall call his name Emmanuel now we're going to read in St John 3: 16 possibly we might already know that scripture by memory but let us read it so we can verify you have it for God so loved the world that he gave his only begotten son that whosoever believeth in him should not perish but have everlasting life well let us pray brother Mighty and good God we thank you for the privilege that you give us to be in this place truly a place that has quite a bit of History to where Lord you have manifested yourself through the word that has been expressed here through many years changed lives in a very radical fashion and now after many years here we are still Lord saying or speaking the word of God waiting on this word can hit the target and in that manner Lord there can be miracles in this place if there's someone here that's sick of their of their body or their soul that the word Goes Forth you might heal them them in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ I ask to relax and in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ amen amen you may be seated Brethren the thought today is God's Gift we're going to speak a little bit on Christmas few days from celebrating Christmas Day and the the word says here in John 3:16 Says for God so loved the world that he gave his only begotten son that whosoever believeth in him should not perish but have everlasting life many people think as they read the scripture that the Lord Jesus Christ came to die for everyone but here God is placing a condition and the condition that God places here is that for him that believeth in him so if you don't believe in him there's not eternal life amen so then Jesus Christ didn't come to die for everyone but he came to die for those that believe in him and believe in him is believing in all of this not just believing in him because just like that or not just believing every year or every Christmas or only believing when it's uh Easter week but it's believing in him always and believing in him believe it means believing in his word the word Christmas comes from the word in Spanish Nativity from the word native or born which means being born which means born and the tradition for many years has taught us 24th and 25th of December the Messiah was born but thanks be to God that we got to know his word and that a prophet explained to us or less in what month the Lord Jesus Christ was born so then the prophet for example begins to speak to us how it is that God wrote in the firmament a Bible how many know that there in the Stars his word is written in the stars so then the prophet of God speaks to us about the Zodiac not about the horoscope because the horoscope has to do with uh trying to to make make something but the Zodiac has to do with the word the word zodiac means circle of animals the prophet teaches us that the first sign in the zodiac is Virgo here a virgin shall conceive and then some other symbols pass and the next important symbol is Aries so then we realize that Aries is in April how many of you were born in April here so then you're Aries speaking on the Zodiac the prophet teaches us that in April when spring is entering in so then the the Lambs are born and Jesus Christ is the Lamb of God that takes away the sins of the world so then we realize that Jesus Christ couldn't have been born in a time of death in other words in winter time winter in those places in Jerusalem it's it's they have a really strong winter if you can see the postcards of when the birth of Jesus Christ in in in winter time we can see that there's snow and things like that so Jesus Christ couldn't have been born in a time of death and even nature speaks of how it is during the winter life itself is hidden for example uh the little animals hibernate the ants take their precautions and they hide themselves squs also hide their food and they hide themselves and also the Bears so there in in the cities well you practically can't even see that but out in in the in the field you can see that or even for example even the trees the the the knowledge or or the the science of the trees it goes their life goes into the roots and it hides now that root is Jesus Christ is that right life is hidden there in the root and it might seem like that tree is dead but only the life is hidden waiting for that moment to come so that life can come up again and when does that life come up again at the spring time they're in March April then those first Lambs are then born but let us see what the prophet of God says in behalf of these times so that we don't go over to the Other Extreme because some of us might be making preparations or for a great uh Christmas Feast so let's not go to one extreme matter fact if you want going to make Christmas dinner you want to invite me I we'll even take you a gift in page one of the message the wrapped gift of God that the prophet preached it on December 25th of 196 indana in Jeffersonville Indiana the brother says so it's always good to come to the house of the Lord but it seems like it's much better on the Christmas time and New Year and also Easter week it seems like at these days leave us a small blessing it's sad that we can't have this Christmas spirit all the time people greeting you and telling you God bless you that's good I like that about Christmas so then people seem to get into like a Happy Spirit Jo and people want to give things away and they want to invite they're in traffic here there's not a lot of traffic but I come from Mexico City and if there's something famous in It's the Great multitude of traffic there is there we were on Baseline yesterday we were on our way to Arizona Mills and in a in a van that my my nephew Benji and his and his wife and so then I'm there driving and then there's a there's a stop and before me in front of me was about 10 cars and the three or four lanes were all filled with cars but there was only about 10 cars ahead and and my father-in-law says oh there's a lot of traffic for me it's nothing I've been in traffic where you have to turn off the car you get off the car you can go you can go buy some some [Applause] subs you come back with the Mexican subs and you give the rest of the people and you make friends brother this is true is that true Gabby there there she is she she's a witness it's it's just that heavy the so when my father-in-law says oh I just laugh in within me so then that makes people be very aggressive and some people begin to to accelerate the car so that way somebody else can't come in they're not going to let him go in so he doesn't even go ahead of him a meter so so they put the car in front of him and the other one also pushes his car in front of but in this time everyone he just says oh go ahead I tell somebody well go ahead can't even believe it that I'm letting him go and he looks at me and shock because I'm letting him pass smiling the other one that's also driving and all the ones that are in the vehicle it's all happiness that they start saying goodby they almost say glory to God that's what this time provokes that kind of a spirit the prophet says I would like to say something that brother Neville has already said very well is that we desire that everyone the best in this Christmas time and during this time of Fellowship in these festive days in other words brother would also say Merry Christmas at these times and I also desire in this moment to express to each and every one of you how grateful I am for all the Christmas cards gifts and things that have come to our home I appreciate it and I thank you with all my heart truly we're happy this morning I have a little boy that he still likes the Christmas tree so then we have it there in the living room so then he had his Christmas tree there in his home don't know big or little but he had his tree with his lights and all that because he had a little boy thanks be to God I have a little boy and I have a tree after my son is big or grown then I'm going to have grandkids I have one here it's at the age then then when I have a grandchild then I'll continue with the tree because kids like the tree and this morning when I came in I walk in and under the tree there many many gifts on from the church my friends from different places that have come and I don't have words that can express how grateful I am for each one of those gifts Lord of Heaven bless you richly that is my prayer all that the prophet says it in the same message the wrapped gift of God God's wrapped gift a gift is is a present the the traditional dictionary gives a definition of what a present is and it's a pleasure that something gives that is given especially uh like a food or a drink that's the dictionary says it's a pleasure that something is proportioned especially a food or a drink to give the dictionary says is to give without receiving anything in return so then if you give and you expect to receive something that's not a gift if you give a gift something to someone don't expect to receive anything because if you say oh well I I gave them and they didn't give me anything that wasn't a gift then you're charging them and they say well this because I gave them something very expensive and he gave me something from that's cost a dollar if you give something if you give a gift don't expect anything that's a gift amen that's why the prophet teaches us that Grace is an unmerited gift let us read in Acts 238 it's a it's another wellknown scripture for us Acts chapter 2 verse 38 read I'm going to wait until you have it then Peter said unto them repent and be baptized every one of you in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of sins and you shall be receive the gift of the Holy Ghost so words you should receive the gift of the Holy Ghost so in other words God has gifts when you believe God has gifts for you and one of the greatest gifts is the Holy Ghost and the Holy Ghost is God himself can you imagine God himself one greatest things that that can ever exist maybe somebody might be able to receive as a gift a screen 100 100 inch screen or they could receive the most expensive watch that exist but that's not the most valuable thing that you can receive in your life the most valuable thing is that as a gift you receive the Holy Ghost because the Holy Ghost is God imagine the creator of all the universe lives in you maybe we're not owners of the universe but we're children of of the owner and That's mighty the the owner of a certain company for example the owner of Ford moror company and that you might be the son of the owner of Ford Motor Company can you imagine that can we imagine that you might go walk through there the factory of and you well you're the son right you'd walk very proud there that you're the son of Mr for well I'm I'm in the mood for this pickup truck bring it to me because I'm going to take it that's true because he's you're the son is that right we're not the sons of the do of the of the of the owner of Fort we're the sons of the owner of the universe what do you need God has gifts for us you just have to ask for it that you'll be willing to ask for it because God has everything prepared for us notice brother when God created you he also created Replacements when a kidney falls apart there's Replacements oh your liver fell apart there's Replacements and we're sons of the owner the only thing we have to say is Lord give me a li give me a liver Lord Daddy give me a liver Oh Daddy give me a kidney Oh Daddy give me a new heart I'm tired of having this Heart of Stone oh I want a new heart father my daddy give me that new heart give me a new mind Lord restore my family Hallelujah Hallelujah are children of the of all the universe Brethren it's human being or mankind that it's the human being that says I believe that God cannot give me this but God has no limits and if God lives in you so then you have no limits all things are possible for him can somebody say glory to God so then God has gifts is Grace Grace is an unmerited inm merited gift let us read in Ephesians chapter 2 ver8 the said and it reads says for by grace are ye saved through faith and that not of yourselves it is the gift of God grace is a gift of God it's an unmar gift or favor it means it's something that you did not deserve but God gave it to you anyway when all of a sudden a son just misbehaves for example the son that's studying or going to school and he just failed all of his classes and well humanly speaking he doesn't deser what he deserves is is a a good uh chastisement but then you come as a father and you say Well only mom and dad can understand this kind of thing maybe the children might not be able to understand this the single children those that are not parents yet because only a parent can feel what it feels like to have a son or a child so the son failed all of his classes he deserves a good chastisement but then all of a sudden instead of chastising him you give him a gift iPhone you give him an iPhone when everyone was expecting something different that's something that's unmerited you deserve but even so the father wanted to give it the son did not deserve it but the son wanted the father wanted to give it to him for God so loved the world that he gave his only begotten son whosoever believeth in him should not be lost but eternal life he gave it he gave the gift we did not deserve it I didn't deserve eternal life I didn't deserve not even to have a family because of the condition of life I was living I didn't deserve to have a wife I didn't deserve to have sons for the life that I was living much less have eternal life but God gave it to me because he wanted to give it to me you can say brother I don't deserve God's forg we know that you don't deserve God's forgiveness we know it well but God gives you forgiveness because he wants to give it to you whoever might say whatever they might say criticize who might criticize God wants to give you that forgiveness God gives you that Grace because he wants to give it to you the prophet of God mentions on a certain occasion in the message message of Grace he speaks to us about Moses how it is that the the Hebrew people they they came out of Egypt they were commanded by the prophet Moses and they came out and they were there in the wilderness and and through those the the tra where they were traveling they found themselves where they didn't have water anymore so then the people began to complain and is this why you took us out of Egypt Moses and why did you take us out of Egypt if at least there we had water to drink at least there we had some garlic and some onion is that why you brought us here we don't even have a water so then God told Moses did you see that rock that's over there grab your stick or your rod and hit the rock strike the and water shall come out of that rock so Moses called all the people and he raised up his rod and he hit the rock and the water came out it was about two million people the people of got there can you imagine if just a a little bit of water came out of that rock the prophet struck the rock but just not just a little bit of water started out it doesn't come like when you open up the the the valve there in Mexico and just a little bit comes out bit for more than 20 million people from Mexico City a little drip do you think a little drip is in when God gives he gives in abundance no when Moses struck the rock it wasn't just a little drip there was a river a big river that came out of water as that River began to go out from there and the people how do you think people reacted let's drink some water and they got their little bottle with their little the water is delicious do you believe that people reacted like that to their to that Fountain of water they wanted to finish up all that they got in there and started they put the camels in there they even put the parrot in there it's like us for example we're here hearing the word of God we're not just going to be just like just just a little bit of Holy Spirit just a oh ju just to keep on going just a little bit when he gives the Holy Ghost he gives it like a river so that we can submer our you can be filled with the Holy Ghost you can try to finish the holy GH you can take it home Fountain of water can come out of those that didn't come to the services that you can share that water look brother I bring you a little so you can get reactiv how many can say glory to God Brethren yes Lord so then time passed and in the wilderness once again they found themselves without water can you imagine a a sun that just doesn't stop sunlight you've had it here right I don't know how much it is in fahit in Cade it's more than 50 grade Centigrade us there in Mexico City with 25 degrees Centigrade we're already dying there oh it's hot I've never been here during the summer I've never been here during the Sumer so then up until today I don't know how it is but you do know how it is that's how the Hebrews were over there and then they were found themselves without water again so then God told Moses speak to the Rock not strike don't strike it but speak to it oh but Moses wanted to be very spectacular about it so then he got his rod and he stood in front of the Rock and he struck the rock the prophet of God says that God could have taken Moses's life at that moment but he let him live by Grace because he only had to speak to the Rock and that rock is Jesus Christ the Rock Jesus Christ it was already struck once one sacrifice sufficient for us if we fell again being in this glorious message we don't need another sacri all we have to do is speak to the Rock a fountain of out an unmerited you but he gave it because he wants to give it to youuu for you this God has prepared for you many GI this morning there's gifts that only you have will to take that gift there's gifts Brethren notice when one receives a gift there's different ways how one acts for example when I give something to my wife she opens the gift well with a lot of she's trying to take away the the the the tap and the bow for it not to get undone and she opens up the gift with a lot of care and sometimes she even puts away the wrapping I don't know if there's any Brethren that do that but my my wife gave me a gift today she gave me a gift but I'm not like her I want to open it up so this is the important thing this is the important thing what I wanted was this I'm going to leave it here so you can remind me so I don't forget it you see how the wrapping was left and some some of them just kick it and then it goes from there into the garbage can is that right but there's a lot of people in these days that they do not receive a gift lot of people that don't receive matter of fact this time for a lot of people or this season is a depressive season for them for many people it's also a time for them to commit suicide statistics speak that in this season is that where more suicides occur people go into into such terrible depressive States there's people that don't live with their family but when this season arrives when the family gets together they enter into depression there's some that just don't have a living family many don't have not even family or friends and they're walking in the street or looking at the people people that are buying gifts and they don't have anyone to give to or for them to give to them there's people that don't even have a home us thank the Lord in our home we know that Thanksgiving is is for the turkey but many also make turkey for christas others others make ham others make loin pork pork loin Mo okay Mo you understood me right and with spaghetti with cheese and cream p p and the pon you know who a Pon is right thanks be to God that in our homes there will be that true but there's homes that just don't have that I don't know here in the United States but in Mexico there's a lot of homes that don't have that years ago I was a taxi driver and my job was to drive around town offering my services as a taxi driver and as a matter of fact on the 24th of December Christmas Eve in the evening let me tell you that taxi drivers on Christmas is a really good time for it was about 1 o' in the morning and I kept on working there in the in the Mexico City and wife she was happy so then I was driving down one of the Avenues of and I got a red light so I stopped and I began to observe what was around me so on on my right side there on the curb there was a [Music] family there was a husband a wife and four children sitting there on the street they were in a little circle and they were having their Christmas dinner I remember that and I I still cry because at at my house I I had sufficient I had but I realized that not everyone has sufficient and this day of Christmas is not the happiest for many people there's people that suffer that's why it says in John 316 for God so love the world that he gave his only begotten son that whosoever believeth in him shall not be lost or shall not perish but has eternal life gifts gifts that not everyone has gifts that not everyone re gifts that there's people that don't have to give families that don't have who to spend Christmas with not even a home where to spend Christmas but God has given us in abundance remember those people and let us pray for them so that God can also give them Prosperity brother Bram on a certain occasion he was preaching at a convention but one day before he had spoken with a little girl a little girl that had polio and she had she had her her metal braces on and she used some special shoes she was a little girl but she wasn't that much a little anymore she was probably already going into her adolescence and her condition began to affect this little girl because she wanted to look but with those braces on her legs and those shoes she knew and she was suffering so then the prophet told her I want you to go to the meeting and I'm going to pray for you and God is going to heal you I want you to sit in the front so then the next day the prophet of God was preaching but before he went in to preach the prophet had a little box it was it was a little wrapped like a gift so he arrived at the pulpit and he put it up on the pole and he began to preach so the little girl was there where her polio braces were on her his her brother that was just behind her oh I mean his brother brother of the Prophet was seated behind him so then as as the the preaching was was going and and a time had already passed and the brother of the Prophet began to think he already forgot surely already forgot what he promised his little girl and the prophet continued preaching and the brother of the Prophet thought again already forgot the promise he made to this little girl and the prophet continued preaching and the third time this brother of the prophet he began to think the same thing already forgot what he promised this little girl so the prophet turned around and looked at his brother he said no I have not forgotten I haven't forgotten what I promised this little girl God God never forgets about his bride God never forgets his people so then he called the little girl and he prayed for her and the little girl was healed at that moment so that the prophet gave that gift to the little girl and the gift inside that present was a pair of new shoes normal shoes so that the little girl could use them a gift from God so then well 2,000 years ago the Lord Jesus Christ arrived please stand Brethren and within him there were gifts but he had them within him you see you notice how I opened up the gift well in that same way was the way Jesus Christ had to be treated to be able to take out the gift that was within him the Lord Jesus Christ was struck he was whipped on him a crown of thorns for our cause they whipped him up until he looked like chopped liver there wasn't one piece or point in his body that was it wasn't just one here and one there literally he was just chopped up to be able to take God's gift out that gift that was within him is the Holy Ghost the gift had to be open it had to be ripped that wrapping had to be ripped for that gift to be to us 50 days after that happened the gift was given unto the people there in that day at Pentecost there that gift arrived to the people what people had need of upon the people in the people within the people the same opportunity that we have today the same Holy Spirit gifts within himself within him he has Joy do somebody need Joy you feel depressed or sad but the Lord Jesus Christ has a gift for you the Holy Ghost is also the gift of love somebody need love of God brother it's only you have to just ask for it
