TRANSCRIPT
========================================
are they part of meeting this meeting is to be a little different meeting than what we usually had here mostly every time when we come together here it's meeting to for the healing of the sick and for the physical needs it's the emphasis is put upon that but tonight we have started this revival for the healing of the soul the spirit of the man however the Lord willing Sunday morning at Sunday school Sunday morning we are going to have prayer for the sick in a regular line of healing or Sunday morning the Lord willing and these weeknights we are greatly pressed to speak on the eternal things for the the soul we know that when a body is healed that makes us all happy because we know that it definitely shows that our God yields the state but that sick person if they lived long enough will perhaps be sick again maybe with the same disease that they were healed on and that doesn't take away healing the doctor will give medicine for pneumonia and maybe two days later they will die with the ammonia after he's pronounced them well it reoccurs again but when that soul is healed you have then in you eternal life and I believe that we are so close to the coming of the Lord Jesus that it behooves us to do all that we possibly can bring Eversole to the kingdom and to bring the kingdom to the people that we might be healed of our spirits I believe that the body of Jesus is the sickest body that I know of that is the body spiritual body of Christ on earth is very sick and now we are not planning on keeping you too long of a night because on the first night we don't have room to seat our beloved friends we're in the project of building a new church a big tabernacle right you're on these Lots or wherever the Lord will lead but as far as we know here and now we have give out the meeting Wednesday through Sunday well then it's Sunday is closing into Christmas holidays but it's whenever the Lord tells us to stop that'll be the time we don't know just what the results will be but believing that the folks here at the tabernacle and our sister churches which is one of them is is the Holderness tabernacle at Utica which brother Grimm Snelling is the pastor and in New Albany where brother juni Jackson is pastor and also out on the highway where brother rattle is pastor we are in their sister churches of this Tabernacle we are trying to bring the art people into a better fellowship with Christ that's our purpose so I have chosen to read and to teach on for the next few nights tonight I want to speak on the subject of what is the Holy Ghost and tomorrow night I want to preach on what given bar and on Friday night and to the recorders I don't want this recorded Friday night how do I get the holy ghost in and how do I know when I have it then we will just let then see what the Lord will lead us for Saturday and Sunday and Sunday morning a healing service and another evangelistic service for Sunday night and now we want everyone to know that and I know the recorders is running in the backroom and we wish to say this because in these meetings like this on the evangelistic type we have people from different denominations of churches which has been taught in their own fear our belief each one and that's alright I have never wanted to be guilty of sowing discord among brethren and out in the meetings I just preach on the great evangelical truth of the scripture on what brethren who sponsor my meeting believe in but in the Tabernacle here I want to speak on what we believe therefore if you if you do not understand it I would be very happy to have a little letter or note from you to ask me a question of why that we believe it thus and I would be glad to try to explain it the best that I can you know every church if you don't have a doctrine you're not a church you've got to have something that you stand for some principles that you're holding up and regardless of what person's affiliation our denomination might be if that person is born doll the Spirit of God that's my brother or my sister regardless of we might different in other things as far as East from the West but we are still brothers and I would not do nothing but try to help that brother foreclosure better walk to Christ and I believe any real true Christian would do the same for me now I've asked this Tabernacle now we're not entering into this just far up attractive meeting I want to enter into this and I want you and have asked you to burn every Bridge that's behind you and make every sin right that we're coming into this with all that's in our hearts and lives we must come here for the sole purpose of getting our souls ready for the coming of the Lord and for no other purpose and as I have spoken and said that maybe sometime I might teach or say something that might be a little contrary to watch someone else will way they believe this idea did not comfort controversy I can't we're here to make ready the coming of the Lord and I think that this little group I've got some visiting brethren with me here I know from different places and we're happy to have them and no doubt the walk out to the audience there there's others from out of town from out from around our little joining cities here we're happy to have you and so appreciate it if you if you love us well enough to come be here these things God may you take home with you my brother's sister the richest treasures God can pour in your heart is my prayer and to this little tabernacle scene I believe that it is one of the finest people that I believe its own earth goes to this tabernacle I never said all the finest people I said some of the finest people on earth go to this tabernacle but as day by day entering back from meeting to meeting I see a great need of this tabernacle a great need in it and that spar of peeling our consecration a deeper life a closer walk with God and I have promised them to do this to have this message is for them and we're glad to bring you in and fellowship with us around the Word of God as we teach and try to bring out how the first three nights we will not be taken a subject of preach on but a message to teach from the Word of God and now for I would not ask anyone to do anything that I would not do myself and this week has been a complete Calvary for me I've been so close to to the blacking out as I would place it till I was almost beside myself but I have completely surrendered every will and everything that I know of to the Lord the other night at around little after midnight wife and I after setting up and praying and talking to the Lord across the little footstool in the our front room with open Bibles we consecrated ourselves a new to God for complete service that we would surrender our own wills and everything in every negative thoughts and to serve the Lord Jesus not trusted that's been your attitude to that you've done the same thing then when we are coming tonight we're coming up all holy ground among a people who's been praying and fasting and making restitutions and getting ready to receive something from God and I know that he that will come hungry will not go away hungry but God will feed with the bread of life now before we read from his sacred book let us bow our head just a moment for prayer Lord there has already been prayer offered in this place tonight there has been the songs of Zion has been sung by your children their hearts has been lifted up and we have come here to consecrate ourselves to thee and to worship thee from the depths of our soul and we are calling this to your remembrance Lord that you said when you set up on them out and taught your disciples listen are they that do hunger and thirst for righteousness for they shall be filled you promised it large we are coming tonight with open hearts we are coming hungry and thirsty and we know you keep your promise as we endeavor to open up these sacred pages of the Bible to read from it the contents may the Holy Spirit just take it to every heart may that speed fall down into deep rich faith that will bring forth ever promise that the word has made hear us Lord and cleanse us in trials and if there be any unclean thing about us Lord any unconfessed seein any thing that's not right reveal it just now or we'll walk right straight and do it or we realize we're living in the chapters of the coming of the Lord Jesus and we have all holy God come into the shadows of that Justice tonight and we are pleading for a new dedication and consecration and feeling of the Holy Spirit in our lives eating the revival bars begin to dim let us throw longwood of the word that it might Kindle a new fire that our hearts to be full of zeal thank Tobias Lord to thy precious Word in our blood and I Grace we plead and all thanks and praise will be done take all prejudice from our hearts cleanse the soul our give us pure hearts and clean hands and clean minds that we might come into the sanctuary night after night rejoicing and feel with your spirit we ask this in Jesus name and for his sake a man I wish to read the word just now while I asked you to bring your Bibles your pencils your papers for scriptures you so desire so it would be very fine and I while you're getting to the seventh chapter of Acts to begin with by answer the question or to start in answering the question what is the Holy Spirit there is nothing that will defeat Satan there's never been nothing on the earth yet that would ever defeat Satan like the Word of God Jesus used it in his great battle that it is written and this morning what I've been listening a few days ago to a broadcast that aim to want to tell that creation just come from some ashes blowing together and some are Satan the few chemicals of the earth and the warm sunshine created the germ of life and brought out life our ridiculous when the sunshine will kill any germ of life lay a germ out in the sunshine it'll kill it immediately and there is no such thing but Satan trying to punch that at me now after I've taken my little Rebecca to school this morning and on the road back I started to turn the radio on again and I thought I'd get into that stuff again so I just turned it back off and as I going on up the street Satan said to me he said do you know that this man that you called Jesus was just a man like one day in his day like Billy Graham Oral Roberts he was just a man that they began to have a few people to gather around and say he's a great man in actuality comes greater and then he become a god to them and now it's scattered all over the world since he's dead and that's all I thought out a liar you are and then I turn just as I was crossing grim Street I said Satan you this talking to my conscience I'd like to ask you a few things who was it that the hebrew prophets spoke of that would come who was The Anointed Messiah what was up on those man who foresaw him and told his life thousands of years before he got here who wasn't it foretold adjust to the letter and when he come they said he was numbered with the transgressors and he was he was wounded for our transgressions and he was he made his grave with the rich but he would rise up the third day and he did and then he promised the Holy Ghost and I've got it so you just might as well get away from it they call it it's written in the word and every word is true then he left just give him the word that does it he can't stand that word or its inspired let's start reading tonight in the seventh chapter of the book of Acts then said the high priest are these things so and he said men and brethren and father parkin the god of glory appeared to our father Abraham when he was in massa Pony on before he dwelt in chyrons and said unto him get thee out of thy country and from thy kindred and common to a land which I'll show thee then cainy out of the land of the Chaldeans and dwell in Sharan and from since when his father was dead he removed him into this land wherein you now dwell and he gave him non inheritance in it no not so much as to set his foot on yet he promised that he would give it to him for a possession and to his seed after him when as yet he had no child God spake on this wise that his seed said sojourn in a strange land and that they should bring them into bondage and entreat them evil for four hundred years and the nation to whom they shall be in bondage will our judge saith God and add to that shall they come forth and serve me in this country and he gave him the Covenant of circumcision and so Abraham begat Isaac and circumcised in the eighth date and I think they got Jacob and Jacob begat the twelve patriarchs upon this place we wish to approach the subject which I think is the outstanding subject of today of the what is the holy spirit what is it and now the reason I have taken these subject in line like this you cannot come and receive the holy spirit unless you know what it is and you cannot receive it if you know what it is unless you believe it's given to you and it's for you and then you cannot know whether you've got it or not unless you know what results it brings so if you know what it is and who it's to and what action it brings when it comes then you'll know what you've got when you get it that just would settle it Josh like I was talking to our brother Jeffrey's today and he said I would like to be at the meeting tonight but I'll be there tomorrow night he didn't know the meeting was going on because we didn't announce it just right here some of the brother Leo and then wrote to some of our friends and told him out of town well because we didn't have room now I said brother Jeffrey's if you sent me down to turn on one of your aura wells and I didn't know nothing about it I'd probably blow it up or I might turn the wrong key or thought the wrong motor I'd have to know how to do it before I did it that's the way with receiving the Holy Ghost you've got to know what you are coming for and how to receive it and what it is now the first place the Holy Spirit has been promised we could take in weeks and never just skip the age of this subject what the Holy Spirit is but the first thing I want to approach it just enough to give an outline each night then see the following night if there's any question how many in here has not received the Holy Ghost been baptized of the Holy Ghost raise your hand you know the admin just looked at him now I want to talk on it as a Holy Spirit being a sign or it is a sign we realize that that all is given to us by Abraham was a father of the promise because God gave the promise to Abraham and to his seed after him the promises made to Abraham and to his seed and this sign is to a covenant people now there is a vast difference between just a Christian and a Holy Ghost filled Christian and now we're going to get this from the scripture and place it just exactly in the scripture the first place there is a Christian professed to be a Christian but if this Christian has not yet been filled with the Holy Ghost he's only in process of being a Christian see he is professed to believe it he's working to it but God has not yet given him this spirit of the Holy Ghost he's not yet reached that goal with God that God's recognized it because that God made a covenant with Abraham after he had called Abraham which is a type of calling sixth believer today he called Abraham and Abraham moved out of his country and went into a strange land to dwell among strange people and that was a type of when God calls the man the stop is meanest repent of extense he turns then from the crowd that he was in to live in a new crowd among new types of people and then after God found Abraham to be safe or to the power that God gave him that he would have the child in through this child all the earth would be blessed then God confirmed his faith by giving him a sign and that sign was circumcision and circumcision is a type of the Holy Spirit just the very next verses of this chapter that we have just read if you want to take it down and the even said in the fifty first verse yeast if Nick's uncircumcised in the heart and ears you do always resist the Holy Ghost as your father's did so to you circumcision is a type of the Holy Ghost and God gave Abraham the the circumcision signed after he had accepted God on his promise and walked out into a strange country it was a time and all his children and his seat after him should have this sign in their flesh because it was a distinction it was to separate them from all other people this sign of circumcision and that's what God uses the day it's the sign of circumcision of the heart the holy spirit that makes God's church a separated church from all other creep phase and denominations there in all kinds of denomination but yet they are a separated people you let me talk to a man two minutes I can tell you whether you the Holy Ghost or not so can you it's separate sent it's a mark it's a sign and the Holy Spirit is a sign and its any child that refused circumcision in the Old Testament which was a foreshadow of the Holy Ghost was cut off from amongst the people he could not have fellowship with the rest of the congregation if he refused to be circumcised now pattern that to today a person that would refuse to receive the baptism of the Holy Ghost can have no fellowship among those that has the Holy Ghost you just can't do it you have to be a nature like it's my mother there used to say birds of a feather flock together well it's an old proverb but it's a true one you don't see doves and crows fellowship in their diets are different their habits are different their desires are different that's why it is with the world and with the Christian when you have been circumcised by the Holy Spirit which means to cut off a flesh circumcision could only be in the mail but if the woman was married to a man she was part of him she was circumcised with him you remember in Timothy words said that notwithstanding she shall be saved in childbearing if she continues in faith and holiness with all sobriety now circumcision you know when Sarah laughed in the tent behind her at the message of the angel when he said Abraham not knowing who he was a stranger where is thy wife Sarah how did he know that he had a wife as Jesus said as it was in the days of love so will it be in the coming of the Son of Man remember those signs wasn't committed down to Sodom and Gomorrah in the world amongst the religionists but it was to the elect that called out and Abraham was called out and the word church means called out the separated like Abraham operating and then when Sarah laughed at the very message of the angel God would have killed her on the spot but he could not bother Sarah without bothering Abraham because they were one she was part of a you're no longer clean but one toe circumcision the Holy Spirit today circumcised is the heart and it's a sign a given side someone said the other day I just repeat this not as a joke because it's the truth but it sounds like a joke as I've often said this is no place for jokes but there was a little German out on the west coast where we were just ad he received the Holy Ghost and he went down the street and he would walk a little piece and he's raised up his hands and speaking tongues and he would run and he would jump and even shout and he was at work hang all I got and his boss said to him where have you been uh-huh I like those places where you have been he said you must have been down amongst that bunch of nuts he said then you think they are nuts he said sure they are he said well praise the Lord for the nuts and he said do you know what the nuts play a big part he said for instance the automobile you take all the nuts out of it you ain't got nothing but a bunch of young so that's just about right you are so different and the Holy Spirit comes on you until the mind of this world don't like you in there oh and they don't want nothing to do with you at all you're a born of another world you are just as much a alien in times more alien you'd be if you'd go in too far from regions of African jungles you're different when the Holy Spirit comes and it's a sign it's unmarked amongst the people now you say then brother venom that sign of circumcision was given to Abraham that is true I'm to his seed yes all right now we are going to turn to Galatians third chapter xxix first and see how that could apply to us Galatians three and twenty nine and just see how this circumcision could have applied to a Gentile if we are Gentiles which by natural birth we are now the first I want to read the sixteenth verse now to Abraham and his seed were the promises made Abraham and his seed he said not and to seeds I just any kind of a cell I'm Abraham seeds - no - a seed Abraham's seed not the seeds as of many but as of one and to do they and to thy seed which is Christ Christ was Abraham's seed you believe that all right now let's get to 28 and 29 first there is neither Jew nor Greek neither is our bond our freeze neither is our male or female for we are all one in Christ Jesus and if ye be Christ's then ye are Abraham's seed and heirs according to the promise how do we take on Abraham's seed by being in Christ then we are Abraham's seed and what was the seed of Abraham as we might go on to Roman's forward different places Abraham never received the promise while he was circumcised to show that circumcision was just a type he received the promise before he was circumcised and it was a type of recognition of his state that he had before he was circumcised now when we are in Christ we become Abraham's seed and her heirs with Christ therefore no matter who we are Jew or Gentile and the seed of Abraham the seed of Abraham has the faith of Abraham who takes God at His Word regardless of how ridiculous it seems how unusual you act how peculiar it makes you you take God at His Word regardless of anything Abraham at 75 years old and Sara at 65 Oh God Eddie's wording called anything contrary to it as though it was easy why do you think the doctors thought of that day what do you think the people thought when they seen an old man 75 years old going around praising God he's going to have a baby by his wife and her 65 years old about 25 years past menopause but you see it makes you act funny the faith of Abraham and when you're circumcised that the Holy Ghost it does the same thing to you it makes you do things that you didn't think you would do it makes you take God's promise and believe God now it's also besides or see a promise and a sign it's also a seal now if you will go with me unto Romans but first I want you to go with me to Ephesians 4:30 and let's read here just a minute Ephesians 4:30 says this now you've heard so many people say that different things are seals if you go into the church you have the seal of the church and some people says it's keeping a certain day a Sabbath day that's that's a seal of God some of them says if we put our membership into a certain denomination we are sealed into the kingdom of God now the Bible said let every man's word be a lie and gods be the truth now Ephesians 4:30 leads like this and grieve not the Holy Spirit of God whereby ye are sealed unto the day of redemption I'm going to have to get a little bit hard on this now lay down are you legal espresso just hold quite a little bit did you notice how long that CLA not to the next revival until the next time something goes wrong I'll kill the day of your Redemption until the day of your redemption when you are redeemed up to be with God that's how long the Holy Spirit steals you not from revival to revival but from the eternity to eternity you're sealed by the Holy Spirit that's what the Holy Spirit is it's the seal of God that he's found you found grace in his sight and he loves you and he believes you and he's putty sealer for you what is the seal anyone or seal designates our means of finished work God has saved you sanctified you cleans you up and in favor with UNCG's finished you're his product until the day of your Redemption yield is the finished thing what is the Holy Ghost it's a sign we're going to get on that little later on or another message the sign that Paul spoke out tongues of the sign to believers right now notice but in this the Holy Ghost is a sign I mean and the Holy Ghost is a seal it's a sign that God gave to his chosen sure you reject it is to be cut from the people I'm to receive it is to be finished with the world and to be a product that God has put a seal of approval on I used to work on the railroad I here with Harry Waterbury and we would go down to load a car my brother died standing back there Epps loads cars when a car's being loaded they go through that car the inspector and if he finds anything loose wart or fall and break or anything that was destroyed he'll not seal that car until that car is so completely packed until it's so packed down and so it harder that's the shaking of the ride won't bother the product that's on the inside that's what's the matter we don't get seal so much weird you loose about things when the inspector goes through to inspect your life to see if you're not just a little loose about things a little loose about your prayer life a little loose about that temper a little loose about that time to talk about other he'll never seal the car some dirty habits some bow things some vulgar T mind he can't seal the car but when he's found everything his place the inspector then he seals it yeah be anybody open that seal until that car's reached its destination of words seal for there it is touch not my anointed do my prophets no harm or I say unto you would be better for you that a millstone was hanging at your neck and you were drowned in the depths of the season even to try to a fin or shake a little on the least of these that's been sealed you see what it means that's what the Holy Spirit is it's your assurance it's your protection it's your witness it's your seat it's your sign I'm heaven bound Wow he seen me he gave it to me he sealed me into his kingdom and glory bound that's a window let's say do what he wants to God's done seal neat all the day of my Redemption hey man that's what the Holy Ghost is oh you should want it I couldn't go on without it so much could be said there but I'm sure you know what I'm speaking of now also let us turn to John 14 just for a minute I just love the word it's the truth now the Spirit of God the Holy Ghost what is the Holy Ghost it is the Spirit of Christ in you now before we read I'd like to say a few commenting words here what is the Holy Ghost to see you what is the Holy Ghost it's a covenant what is the Holy Ghost it's a sign what is the Holy Ghost and if a the spirit of Jesus Christ in you a little wild said Jesus said the world sees me no more yet you shall see me or I will be with you even in you to the end of the world fear of God in His Church what far what did you do it for this is a little long tomorrow night subject well what did he do it Paul why did he why did the Holy Spirit well why did he come for what did he come in you Paul what did he come in me for wants to continue the works are bound I always do that which is pleasing to my father I come not to do my own will but the father that sent me and the father that sent me is with me and as my father has sent me so send the father sent him when any the father that sent Jesus came any work to him that Jesus that sent you goes with you and is in you and if that spirit living in Jesus Christ may him do an act the way he did you'll have some general idea how to do when it's in you those that life cannot change it'll go from body to body but it cannot change its nature or it is gone now in John 14 is let's read just a little bit beginning of the tenth verse believe us doubt that I am in the father and the father in me the works the words that I speak unto you I speak not of myself but the father that dwelleth in me he doeth the works think of it now believe me that I am in the father and the father in me or else believe me for the very works sake barely barely I say on you he that believeth on me the works that I do shall he also and greater works than these shall he do because I go to my father don't you see the I said there and I watch this how this comes out I read this little father we're gonna read down about the 21st and whatsoever ye shall ask them to see I had their young and whatsoever ye shall ask in my name that will I do that the father may be glorified in the son if you shall ask anything in my name I'll do if you love me keep my Commandments and I will pray the father I watch and he shall give you another comforter that he may abide with you forever even the Spirit of Truth whom the world cannot receive because it seeth him not neither North him but you know him or he dwelleth with you and shall be in you who is that spirit then what is the Holy Gold its Christ in you the comforter that's the Holy Spirit and when the comforter has come he will do the same things that I done while the comforter is in me I'll pray the father he'll give you this comforter you know the come for the world don't know him never will but you know him because he dwells now with you Jesus speaking but he shall be in you there we are that's the comforter shall be in you I will not leave you comfortless I will come to you I will not now that's the comforter Christ that's what the Holy Ghost is it's crying yet a little while and the world seeth me no more but ye shall see me because I live you live also oh we could go on and on I'll let you know what is he he's the seal he's a son he's a confident he what all he is the seed of Abraham inherited down that's also fine that's the what else to comfort area let's go to first John 16:7 if he isn't an advocate - you ought to advocate is making an advocate we have an advocate we know then first John the sixteenth chapter or way that I'm sorry thanks John it is sixteen seven I'm sorry I'm sure sorry I said that I read that wrong got sixteen seven nevertheless I tell you the truth it is expedient for you that I go away or if I go not away the comforter will not come on to you but if I depart I will send him unto you believe not on me of righteous because go to the Father and you see me no more of
