[1:03:26] it's good to see each and every one of
[1:03:30] you and um as a family
[1:03:45] Familia as a family we really haven't
[1:03:48] said much about about
[1:03:54] Dad
[1:03:56] not not by
[1:04:00] Design but when um Dad took a
[1:04:09] turn um it actually surprised all of
[1:04:14] us so we were were
[1:04:19] unprepared um for these several month
[1:04:23] that have uh have come and gone
[1:04:31] and my dad's a really private
[1:04:35] person and not really wanting to bring
[1:04:38] he doesn't like
[1:04:42] attention and we just as a family have
[1:04:44] been United together to
[1:04:49] um to to be
[1:04:51] there um to help
[1:04:54] Mom um in everything and my
[1:04:58] dad so uh in saying this is that
[1:05:03] uh the the the doctors basically have
[1:05:06] given up on
[1:05:10] Dad and so he's home
[1:05:14] now uh he's with
[1:05:16] Mom uh with my sister
[1:05:19] Faith and a lot of the brothers that are

[1:05:24] moment
[1:05:26] some have come from out of
[1:05:29] town um to be with him be with

[1:17:46] everyone but every time that the Lord

[1:18:57] please receive greetings from the church

[1:19:00] Mexico there's a great majority of
[1:19:02] Brethren there that love
[1:19:06] you not only do they love you but they
[1:19:08] admire
[1:19:10] you and they know
[1:19:12] you you don't know them
[1:19:16] but they do know
[1:19:18] you because they see you on the
[1:19:22] videos and all of a sudden all your face
[1:19:26] if you're bored or you're
[1:19:31] happy they can see everything
[1:19:38] there saying all this please
[1:19:41] stand let's read the mighty word of
[1:19:45] God reading two
[1:19:48] scriptures the first one is in Isaiah
[1:19:53] 7:14
[1:19:57] Isaiah
[1:20:02] 7:14 you have it
[1:20:10] brother then it
[1:20:22] reads therefore the Lord himself shall
[1:20:24] give you a sign Behold a virgin shall
[1:20:28] conceive and bear a son and shall call
[1:20:31] his name
[1:20:36] Emmanuel now we're going to read in St
[1:20:38] John 3:
[1:20:42] 16 possibly we might already know that
[1:20:44] scripture by
[1:20:47] memory but let us read it so we can
[1:20:52] verify you have it
[1:21:05] for God so loved the world that he gave
[1:21:07] his only begotten son that whosoever
[1:21:09] believeth in him should not perish but
[1:21:11] have everlasting
[1:21:13] life well let us pray
[1:21:16] brother Mighty and good God we thank
[1:21:21] you for the privilege that you give us
[1:21:23] to be in this place
[1:21:27] truly a place that has quite a bit of
[1:21:31] History to where Lord you have
[1:21:33] manifested
[1:21:37] yourself through the word that has been
[1:21:39] expressed here through many
[1:21:43] years changed lives in a very radical
[1:21:49] fashion and now after many years here we
[1:21:52] are still Lord
[1:21:55] saying or speaking the word of
[1:21:58] God waiting on this
[1:22:00] word can hit the
[1:22:03] target and in that manner
[1:22:07] Lord there can be miracles in this
[1:22:13] place if there's someone here that's
[1:22:16] sick of their of their body or their
[1:22:20] soul that the word Goes Forth you might
[1:22:24] heal them them in the name of the Lord
[1:22:25] Jesus
[1:22:28] Christ I ask to relax and in the name of
[1:22:32] the Lord Jesus Christ amen
[1:22:36] amen you may be seated
[1:22:40] Brethren the thought today is God's
[1:22:45] Gift we're going to speak a little bit
[1:22:47] on
[1:22:53] Christmas few days from celebrating
[1:22:55] Christmas
[1:23:00] Day and the the word says here in John
[1:23:05] 3:16 Says for God so loved the
[1:23:09] world that he gave his only begotten
[1:23:13] son that whosoever believeth in him
[1:23:17] should not perish but have everlasting
[1:23:22] life many people think as they read the
[1:23:26] scripture that the Lord Jesus Christ
[1:23:28] came to die for
[1:23:31] everyone but here God is placing a
[1:23:35] condition and the condition that God
[1:23:37] places
[1:23:39] here is that for him that believeth in
[1:23:43] him so if you don't believe in him
[1:23:47] there's not eternal life
[1:23:51] amen so then Jesus Christ didn't come to
[1:23:53] die for
[1:23:56] everyone but he came to die for those
[1:23:58] that believe in
[1:24:00] him and believe in him is believing in
[1:24:03] all of
[1:24:05] this not just believing in him because
[1:24:07] just like
[1:24:09] that or not just believing every year or
[1:24:13] every
[1:24:15] Christmas or only believing when it's uh
[1:24:18] Easter
[1:24:20] week but it's believing in him
[1:24:23] always
[1:24:25] and believing in him believe it means
[1:24:27] believing in his
[1:24:29] word the word
[1:24:33] Christmas comes from the word in Spanish
[1:24:37] Nativity from the word
[1:24:39] native or
[1:24:41] born which means being
[1:24:46] born which means
[1:24:49] born and the tradition for many
[1:24:52] years has taught us
[1:25:00] 24th and 25th of December the Messiah
[1:25:02] was
[1:25:03] born but thanks be to
[1:25:06] God that we got to know his
[1:25:10] word and that a prophet explained to
[1:25:16] us or less in what month the Lord Jesus
[1:25:19] Christ was
[1:25:21] born so then the prophet for example
[1:25:23] begins to speak to
[1:25:26] us how it is that God wrote in the
[1:25:30] firmament a
[1:25:33] Bible how many know
[1:25:35] that there in the
[1:25:39] Stars his word is written in the
[1:25:43] stars so then the prophet of God speaks
[1:25:46] to us about the
[1:25:47] Zodiac not about the
[1:25:51] horoscope because the horoscope has to
[1:25:54] do with uh trying to to make make
[1:25:58] something but the Zodiac has to do with
[1:26:00] the
[1:26:03] word the word zodiac means circle of
[1:26:11] animals the prophet teaches us that the
[1:26:14] first sign in the zodiac is
[1:26:18] Virgo here a virgin shall
[1:26:22] conceive and then some other symbols
[1:26:28] pass and the next important symbol is
[1:26:34] Aries so then we realize that Aries is
[1:26:37] in
[1:26:39] April how many of you were born in April
[1:26:43] here so then you're
[1:26:45] Aries speaking on the
[1:26:52] Zodiac the prophet teaches us that in
[1:26:56] April when spring is entering
[1:27:00] in so then the the Lambs are
[1:27:05] born and Jesus Christ is the Lamb of God
[1:27:08] that takes away the sins of the
[1:27:14] world so then we realize that Jesus
[1:27:16] Christ couldn't have been born in a time
[1:27:17] of
[1:27:19] death in other words in winter
[1:27:23] time
[1:27:25] winter in those places in
[1:27:29] Jerusalem it's it's they have a really
[1:27:31] strong
[1:27:34] winter if you can see the
[1:27:40] postcards of when the birth of Jesus
[1:27:42] Christ in in in winter
[1:27:46] time we can see that there's snow and
[1:27:48] things like
[1:27:51] that so Jesus Christ couldn't have been
[1:27:53] born in a time of
[1:27:56] death and even nature
[1:27:58] speaks of how it is during the
[1:28:01] winter life itself is
[1:28:06] hidden for example uh the little animals
[1:28:11] hibernate the ants take their
[1:28:14] precautions and they hide
[1:28:19] themselves squs also hide their food and
[1:28:22] they hide themselves and also the
[1:28:26] Bears so there in in the cities well you
[1:28:29] practically can't even see
[1:28:30] that but out in in the in the field you
[1:28:33] can see
[1:28:34] that or even for example even the
[1:28:38] trees the the the knowledge or or the
[1:28:40] the science of the
[1:28:42] trees it goes their life goes into the
[1:28:45] roots and it
[1:28:47] hides now that root is Jesus Christ is
[1:28:50] that
[1:28:53] right life is hidden there in the
[1:28:58] root and it might seem like that tree is
[1:29:03] dead but only the life is
[1:29:07] hidden waiting for that moment to
[1:29:11] come so that life can come up
[1:29:14] again and when does that life come up
[1:29:17] again at the spring
[1:29:20] time they're in March
[1:29:23] April
[1:29:24] then those first Lambs are then
[1:29:27] born but let us see what the prophet of
[1:29:30] God
[1:29:31] says in behalf of these
[1:29:35] times so that we don't go over to the
[1:29:37] Other
[1:29:41] Extreme because some of us might be
[1:29:43] making preparations
[1:29:45] or for a great uh Christmas
[1:29:50] Feast so let's not go to one
[1:29:53] extreme
[1:29:56] matter fact if you want going to make
[1:29:58] Christmas dinner you want to invite
[1:30:01] me I we'll even take you a
[1:30:07] gift in page
[1:30:10] one of the message the wrapped gift of
[1:30:15] God that the prophet preached it on
[1:30:18] December 25th of 196 indana in
[1:30:20] Jeffersonville
[1:30:22] Indiana the brother says
[1:30:26] so it's always good to come to the house
[1:30:27] of the
[1:30:29] Lord but it seems like it's much
[1:30:32] better on the Christmas time and New
[1:30:36] Year and also Easter
[1:30:40] week it seems like at these
[1:30:44] days leave us a small
[1:30:48] blessing it's
[1:30:52] sad that we can't have this Christmas
[1:30:54] spirit all the
[1:30:57] time people greeting
[1:31:00] you and telling you God bless you that's
[1:31:05] good I like that about
[1:31:10] Christmas so then people seem to get
[1:31:12] into like a Happy Spirit
[1:31:14] Jo and people want to give things
[1:31:17] away and they want to
[1:31:20] invite they're in
[1:31:22] traffic here there's not a lot of
[1:31:25] traffic but I come from Mexico
[1:31:28] City and if there's something famous
[1:31:32] in It's the Great multitude of traffic
[1:31:35] there is
[1:31:37] there we were on Baseline
[1:31:41] yesterday we were on our way to Arizona
[1:31:46] Mills and in a in a van that
[1:31:50] my my nephew Benji and his and his wife
[1:31:55] and so then I'm there
[1:31:57] driving and then there's a there's a
[1:32:02] stop and before me in front of me was
[1:32:04] about 10
[1:32:09] cars and the three or four lanes were
[1:32:11] all filled with
[1:32:13] cars but there was only about 10 cars
[1:32:17] ahead and and my father-in-law says oh
[1:32:20] there's a lot of
[1:32:22] traffic for me it's
[1:32:29] nothing I've been in traffic where you
[1:32:31] have to turn off the car you get off the
[1:32:33] car you can go you can go buy some some
[1:32:38] [Applause]
[1:32:39] subs you come back with the Mexican
[1:32:42] subs and you give the rest of the
[1:32:45] people and you make
[1:32:48] friends brother this is
[1:32:52] true is that true
[1:32:56] Gabby there there she is she she's a
[1:32:59] witness it's it's just that heavy
[1:33:02] the so when my father-in-law says
[1:33:06] oh I just laugh in within
[1:33:10] me so then that makes people be very
[1:33:15] aggressive and some people begin to to
[1:33:18] accelerate the car so that way somebody
[1:33:19] else can't come
[1:33:21] in they're not going to let him go in so
[1:33:23] he doesn't even go ahead of him a
[1:33:27] meter
[1:33:30] so
[1:33:31] so they put the car in front of
[1:33:34] him and the other one also pushes his
[1:33:36] car in front of but in this
[1:33:39] time everyone he just says oh go
[1:33:45] ahead I tell somebody well go
[1:33:48] ahead can't even believe it that I'm
[1:33:50] letting him
[1:33:51] go and he looks at me and
[1:33:55] shock because I'm letting him pass
[1:34:00] smiling the other one that's also
[1:34:03] driving and all the ones that are in the
[1:34:07] vehicle it's all happiness that they
[1:34:09] start saying
[1:34:10] goodby they almost say glory to
[1:34:18] God that's what this time provokes that
[1:34:21] kind of a
[1:34:22] spirit
[1:34:26] the prophet says I would like to say
[1:34:29] something that brother Neville has
[1:34:31] already said very
[1:34:33] well is that we desire that
[1:34:36] everyone the best in this Christmas
[1:34:40] time and during this time of
[1:34:43] Fellowship in these festive
[1:34:48] days in other words brother would also
[1:34:51] say Merry Christmas at these times
[1:34:57] and I also desire in this moment to
[1:34:58] express to each and every one of
[1:35:02] you how grateful I am for all the
[1:35:05] Christmas
[1:35:08] cards gifts and things that have come to
[1:35:10] our
[1:35:12] home I appreciate it and I thank you
[1:35:15] with all my
[1:35:17] heart truly we're happy this
[1:35:21] morning I have a little boy
[1:35:26] that he still likes the Christmas
[1:35:28] tree so then we have it there in the
[1:35:30] living
[1:35:32] room so then he had his Christmas tree
[1:35:34] there in his
[1:35:36] home don't know big or little but he had
[1:35:38] his
[1:35:40] tree with his lights and all
[1:35:44] that because he had a little
[1:35:49] boy thanks be to God I have a little boy
[1:35:51] and I have a
[1:35:52] tree
[1:35:54] after my son is big or
[1:35:57] grown then I'm going to have
[1:36:00] grandkids I have one here it's at the
[1:36:05] age then then when I have a grandchild
[1:36:08] then I'll continue with the tree because
[1:36:10] kids like the
[1:36:14] tree and this morning when I came
[1:36:18] in I walk
[1:36:21] in and under the tree
[1:36:25] there many many gifts on from the
[1:36:29] church my friends from different places
[1:36:32] that have
[1:36:34] come and I don't have words that can
[1:36:39] express how grateful I am for each one
[1:36:42] of those
[1:36:44] gifts Lord of Heaven bless you richly
[1:36:48] that is my
[1:36:50] prayer all that the prophet says it in
[1:36:52] the same message
[1:36:54] the wrapped gift of
[1:36:56] God God's wrapped
[1:37:00] gift a gift is is a
[1:37:06] present the the traditional
[1:37:11] dictionary gives a definition of what a
[1:37:13] present
[1:37:15] is and it's a
[1:37:19] pleasure that something gives that is
[1:37:22] given
[1:37:24] especially uh like a food or a
[1:37:29] drink that's the dictionary
[1:37:33] says it's a pleasure that something is
[1:37:37] proportioned especially a food or a
[1:37:42] drink to give the dictionary
[1:37:47] says is to give without receiving
[1:37:49] anything in
[1:37:51] return so then if you give
[1:37:55] and you expect to receive something
[1:37:57] that's not a
[1:37:59] gift if you give a
[1:38:02] gift something to
[1:38:04] someone don't expect to receive
[1:38:09] anything because if you say oh well I I
[1:38:11] gave them and they didn't give me
[1:38:15] anything that wasn't a gift then you're
[1:38:17] charging
[1:38:20] them and they say well this because I
[1:38:22] gave them something very
[1:38:24] expensive and he gave me something from
[1:38:27] that's cost a
[1:38:30] dollar if you give something if you give
[1:38:32] a gift don't expect anything that's a
[1:38:35] gift
[1:38:40] amen that's why the prophet teaches us
[1:38:42] that Grace is an unmerited
[1:38:46] gift let us read in Acts
[1:38:51] 238 it's a it's another wellknown
[1:38:53] scripture for
[1:38:59] us Acts chapter 2 verse
[1:39:06] 38 read I'm going to wait until you have
[1:39:22] it
[1:39:25] then Peter said unto them repent and be
[1:39:27] baptized every one of you in the name of
[1:39:28] Jesus Christ for the remission of sins
[1:39:30] and you shall be receive the gift of the
[1:39:33] Holy
[1:39:35] Ghost so words you should receive the
[1:39:38] gift of the Holy
[1:39:40] Ghost so in other words God has
[1:39:45] gifts when you believe God has gifts for
[1:39:50] you and one of the greatest gifts is the
[1:39:53] Holy
[1:39:55] Ghost and the Holy Ghost is God
[1:39:59] himself can you imagine God
[1:40:03] himself one greatest things that that
[1:40:06] can ever
[1:40:09] exist maybe somebody might be able to
[1:40:11] receive as a gift a
[1:40:14] screen 100 100 inch
[1:40:19] screen or they could receive the most
[1:40:21] expensive watch that exist
[1:40:25] but that's not the most valuable thing
[1:40:26] that you can receive in your life the
[1:40:29] most valuable
[1:40:30] thing is that as a
[1:40:33] gift you receive the Holy
[1:40:37] Ghost because the Holy Ghost is
[1:40:42] God imagine the creator of all the
[1:40:44] universe lives in
[1:40:47] you maybe we're not owners of the
[1:40:50] universe but we're children of of the
[1:40:54] owner and That's
[1:40:59] mighty the the owner of a certain
[1:41:03] company for example the owner of Ford
[1:41:06] moror
[1:41:07] company and that you might be the son of
[1:41:11] the owner of Ford Motor
[1:41:13] Company can you imagine
[1:41:16] that can we imagine
[1:41:20] that you might go walk through there the
[1:41:23] factory
[1:41:24] of and you well you're the son
[1:41:28] right you'd walk very proud there that
[1:41:30] you're the son of Mr
[1:41:33] for well I'm I'm in the mood for this
[1:41:35] pickup
[1:41:37] truck bring it to me because I'm going
[1:41:39] to take
[1:41:40] it that's true because he's you're the
[1:41:43] son is that
[1:41:47] right we're not the sons of the do of
[1:41:50] the of the of the owner of
[1:41:52] Fort
[1:41:54] we're the sons of the owner of the
[1:41:58] universe what do you
[1:42:01] need God has gifts for
[1:42:05] us you just have to ask for
[1:42:09] it that you'll be willing to ask for
[1:42:13] it because God has everything prepared
[1:42:16] for
[1:42:18] us notice brother when God created
[1:42:22] you he also created
[1:42:30] Replacements when a kidney falls
[1:42:34] apart there's
[1:42:37] Replacements oh your liver fell
[1:42:40] apart there's
[1:42:42] Replacements and we're sons of the
[1:42:47] owner the only thing we have to say is
[1:42:49] Lord give me a
[1:42:51] li give me a liver Lord
[1:42:55] Daddy give me a
[1:42:57] liver Oh Daddy give me a
[1:43:01] kidney Oh Daddy give me a new
[1:43:05] heart I'm tired of having this Heart of
[1:43:09] Stone oh I want a new
[1:43:12] heart father my
[1:43:14] daddy give me that new
[1:43:17] heart give me a new
[1:43:20] mind Lord restore my family Hallelujah
[1:43:23] Hallelujah are children of
[1:43:26] the of all the universe
[1:43:30] Brethren it's human being or mankind
[1:43:35] that it's the human being that says I
[1:43:38] believe that God cannot give me
[1:43:41] this but God has no
[1:43:44] limits and if God lives in
[1:43:47] you so then you have no
[1:43:51] limits all things are possible for
[1:43:54] him can somebody say glory to
[1:43:59] God so then God has
[1:44:07] gifts is Grace Grace is an unmerited inm
[1:44:10] merited
[1:44:11] gift let us read in Ephesians chapter 2
[1:44:21] ver8 the said and it
[1:44:25] reads says for by grace are ye
[1:44:28] saved through
[1:44:31] faith and that not of
[1:44:33] yourselves it is the gift of
[1:44:38] God grace is a gift of
[1:44:43] God it's an unmar gift or
[1:44:48] favor it means it's something that you
[1:44:50] did not
[1:44:52] deserve but God gave it to you
[1:44:56] anyway when all of a sudden a
[1:44:59] son just
[1:45:03] misbehaves for example the son that's
[1:45:05] studying or going to
[1:45:07] school and he just failed all of his
[1:45:13] classes and well humanly speaking he
[1:45:16] doesn't
[1:45:17] deser what he deserves is is a a good uh
[1:45:21] chastisement
[1:45:24] but then you come as a
[1:45:29] father and you say Well only mom and dad
[1:45:32] can understand this kind of
[1:45:36] thing maybe the children might not be
[1:45:38] able to understand
[1:45:41] this the single children those that are
[1:45:43] not parents
[1:45:46] yet because only a parent can
[1:45:50] feel what it feels like to have a son or
[1:45:53] a
[1:45:55] child so the son failed all of his
[1:45:59] classes he deserves a good
[1:46:03] chastisement but then all of a sudden
[1:46:05] instead of chastising him you give him a
[1:46:11] gift iPhone you give him an
[1:46:17] iPhone when everyone was expecting
[1:46:19] something
[1:46:21] different
[1:46:24] that's something that's unmerited you
[1:46:27] deserve but even so the father wanted to
[1:46:31] give
[1:46:31] it the son did not deserve it but the
[1:46:35] son wanted the father wanted to give it
[1:46:37] to
[1:46:37] him for God so loved the
[1:46:41] world that he
[1:46:43] gave his only begotten
[1:46:47] son whosoever believeth in him should
[1:46:50] not be lost but eternal
[1:46:54] life he gave
[1:46:56] it he gave the
[1:46:59] gift we did not deserve
[1:47:02] it I didn't deserve eternal
[1:47:07] life I didn't deserve not even to have a
[1:47:11] family because of the condition of life
[1:47:13] I was
[1:47:14] living I didn't deserve to have a
[1:47:18] wife I didn't deserve to have
[1:47:21] sons for the life that I was
[1:47:24] living much less have eternal life but
[1:47:28] God gave it to me because he wanted to
[1:47:32] give it to
[1:47:34] me you can say brother I don't deserve
[1:47:37] God's
[1:47:38] forg we know that you don't deserve
[1:47:41] God's forgiveness we know it
[1:47:44] well but God gives you
[1:47:47] forgiveness because he wants to give it
[1:47:50] to
[1:47:51] you whoever might say whatever they
[1:47:53] might say criticize who might
[1:47:57] criticize God wants to give you that
[1:47:59] forgiveness God gives you that
[1:48:02] Grace because he wants to give it to
[1:48:06] you the prophet of God mentions on a
[1:48:09] certain occasion in the message message
[1:48:12] of
[1:48:13] Grace he speaks to us about
[1:48:18] Moses how it is that the the Hebrew
[1:48:21] people
[1:48:24] they they came out of
[1:48:27] Egypt they were commanded by the prophet
[1:48:31] Moses and they came out and they were
[1:48:33] there in the
[1:48:34] wilderness and and through those the the
[1:48:37] tra where they were
[1:48:39] traveling they found themselves where
[1:48:42] they didn't have water
[1:48:46] anymore so then the people began to
[1:48:50] complain and is this why you took us out
[1:48:53] of Egypt
[1:48:54] Moses and why did you take us out of
[1:48:58] Egypt if at least there we had water to
[1:49:04] drink at least there we had some garlic
[1:49:06] and some
[1:49:08] onion is that why you brought us
[1:49:10] here we don't even have a
[1:49:15] water so then God told
[1:49:18] Moses did you see that rock that's over
[1:49:21] there grab your stick or your
[1:49:25] rod and hit the rock strike
[1:49:29] the and water shall come out of that
[1:49:34] rock so Moses called all the
[1:49:37] people and he raised up his
[1:49:39] rod and he hit the rock and the water
[1:49:43] came
[1:49:48] out it was about two million people the
[1:49:52] people of got
[1:49:55] there can you imagine if just a a little
[1:49:58] bit of water came out of that
[1:50:02] rock the prophet struck the
[1:50:06] rock but just not just a little bit of
[1:50:08] water started
[1:50:12] out it doesn't come like when you open
[1:50:15] up the the the valve there in Mexico and
[1:50:17] just a little bit comes out
[1:50:20] bit for more than 20 million people from
[1:50:23] Mexico
[1:50:26] City a little
[1:50:29] drip do you think a little drip is in
[1:50:31] when God gives he gives in
[1:50:34] abundance no when Moses struck the
[1:50:38] rock it wasn't just a little
[1:50:41] drip there was a
[1:50:44] river a big river that came out of
[1:50:48] water as that River began to go out from
[1:50:51] there and the
[1:50:54] people how do you think people
[1:51:03] reacted let's drink some water and they
[1:51:05] got their little
[1:51:07] bottle with their
[1:51:12] little the water is
[1:51:16] delicious do you believe that people
[1:51:17] reacted like
[1:51:21] that to their to that Fountain of
[1:51:25] water they wanted to finish up all
[1:51:28] that they got in there and
[1:51:31] started they put the camels in
[1:51:34] there they even put the parrot in
[1:51:40] there it's like us for
[1:51:42] example we're here hearing the word of
[1:51:47] God we're not just going to be just like
[1:51:51] just
[1:51:53] just a little bit of Holy Spirit just
[1:51:55] a oh ju just to keep on going just a
[1:51:58] little
[1:52:02] bit when he gives the Holy Ghost he
[1:52:05] gives it like a
[1:52:06] river so that we can submer
[1:52:09] our you can be filled with the Holy
[1:52:14] Ghost you can try to finish the holy
[1:52:17] GH you can take it
[1:52:21] home Fountain of water can come out
[1:52:25] of those that didn't come to the
[1:52:27] services that you can share that
[1:52:31] water look brother I bring you a
[1:52:35] little so you can get
[1:52:38] reactiv how many can say glory to God
[1:52:41] Brethren yes
[1:52:45] Lord so then time
[1:52:48] passed and in the
[1:52:51] wilderness once again they found
[1:52:54] themselves without
[1:52:55] water can you imagine a a sun that just
[1:52:58] doesn't stop
[1:53:01] sunlight you've had it here
[1:53:05] right I don't know how much it is in
[1:53:09] fahit in Cade it's more than 50 grade
[1:53:14] Centigrade us there in Mexico
[1:53:17] City with 25 degrees
[1:53:21] Centigrade we're already dying there oh
[1:53:25] it's
[1:53:26] hot I've never been here during the
[1:53:30] summer I've never been here during the
[1:53:32] Sumer so then up until today I don't
[1:53:34] know how it
[1:53:35] is but you do know how it
[1:53:39] is that's how the Hebrews were over
[1:53:41] there and then they were found
[1:53:43] themselves without water
[1:53:46] again so then God told
[1:53:49] Moses speak to the Rock
[1:53:53] not strike don't strike it but speak to
[1:53:59] it oh but Moses wanted to be very
[1:54:02] spectacular about
[1:54:06] it so then he got his
[1:54:08] rod and he stood in front of the Rock
[1:54:11] and he struck the
[1:54:13] rock the prophet of God
[1:54:18] says that God could have taken Moses's
[1:54:20] life at that moment
[1:54:23] but he let him live by
[1:54:25] Grace because he only had to speak to
[1:54:28] the Rock and that rock is Jesus
[1:54:32] Christ the Rock Jesus
[1:54:34] Christ it was already struck
[1:54:37] once one
[1:54:40] sacrifice sufficient for
[1:54:43] us if we fell
[1:54:46] again being in this glorious
[1:54:50] message we don't need another sacri
[1:54:53] all we have to do is speak to the
[1:54:59] Rock a fountain of
[1:55:03] out an
[1:55:05] unmerited you but he gave
[1:55:08] it because he wants to give it to
[1:55:16] youuu for you this God has prepared for
[1:55:20] you many GI
[1:55:23] this
[1:55:28] morning there's gifts that only you have
[1:55:30] will to take that
[1:55:34] gift there's gifts
[1:55:41] Brethren notice when one receives a
[1:55:44] gift there's different ways how one
[1:55:48] acts for example when I give something
[1:55:50] to my wife
[1:55:53] she opens the gift well with a lot
[1:55:55] of she's trying to take away the the the
[1:55:58] the
[1:55:59] tap and the bow for it not to get
[1:56:03] undone and she opens up the
[1:56:06] gift with a lot of care and sometimes
[1:56:08] she even puts away the
[1:56:11] wrapping I don't know if there's any
[1:56:14] Brethren that do
[1:56:17] that but my my wife gave me a gift
[1:56:20] today she gave me a gift
[1:56:23] but I'm not like
[1:56:25] her I want to open it
[1:56:35] up so this is the important
[1:56:42] thing this is the important
[1:56:44] thing what I wanted was
[1:56:51] this I'm going to leave it here so you
[1:56:53] can remind me so I don't forget
[1:56:57] it you see how the wrapping was
[1:57:00] left and some some of them just kick
[1:57:06] it and then it goes from there into the
[1:57:08] garbage
[1:57:09] can is that
[1:57:14] right but there's a lot of people in
[1:57:16] these days that they do not receive a
[1:57:21] gift lot of people that don't
[1:57:24] receive matter of fact this time for a
[1:57:26] lot of
[1:57:28] people or this season is a depressive
[1:57:30] season for
[1:57:34] them for many people it's also a time
[1:57:36] for them to commit
[1:57:39] suicide statistics
[1:57:41] speak that in this
[1:57:44] season is that where more suicides
[1:57:49] occur people go into into such terrible
[1:57:52] depressive
[1:57:54] States there's people that don't live
[1:57:56] with their
[1:57:59] family but when this season arrives when
[1:58:02] the family gets
[1:58:03] together they enter into
[1:58:08] depression there's some that just don't
[1:58:10] have a living
[1:58:13] family many don't have not even family
[1:58:16] or
[1:58:18] friends and they're walking in the
[1:58:20] street or looking at the people
[1:58:23] people that are buying
[1:58:27] gifts and they don't have anyone to give
[1:58:30] to or for them to give to
[1:58:33] them there's people that don't even have
[1:58:35] a
[1:58:38] home us thank the
[1:58:41] Lord in our
[1:58:47] home we know that Thanksgiving is is for
[1:58:51] the turkey
[1:58:54] but many also make turkey for
[1:58:57] christas others others make
[1:59:01] ham others
[1:59:03] make loin pork pork loin Mo okay
[1:59:09] Mo you understood me
[1:59:12] right and with
[1:59:16] spaghetti with cheese and
[1:59:21] cream
[1:59:23] p p and the pon you know who a Pon is
[1:59:29] right thanks be to God that in our homes
[1:59:32] there will be that
[1:59:34] true but there's homes that just don't
[1:59:36] have
[1:59:40] that I don't know here in the United
[1:59:42] States but in Mexico there's a lot of
[1:59:44] homes that don't have
[1:59:46] that years ago I was a taxi
[1:59:51] driver
[1:59:54] and my job was to drive around town
[1:59:56] offering my services as a taxi
[2:00:00] driver and as a matter of fact on the
[2:00:02] 24th of December Christmas Eve in the
[2:00:08] evening let me tell you that taxi
[2:00:10] drivers on Christmas is a really good
[2:00:12] time
[2:00:13] for it was about 1 o' in the
[2:00:17] morning and I kept on working there in
[2:00:19] the in the Mexico City and wife she was
[2:00:25] happy so then I was driving down one of
[2:00:28] the Avenues
[2:00:29] of and I got a red light so I
[2:00:35] stopped and I began to observe what was
[2:00:37] around
[2:00:38] me so on on my right
[2:00:42] side there on the
[2:00:44] curb there was a
[2:00:46] [Music]
[2:00:47] family there was a husband a wife and
[2:00:50] four children
[2:00:53] sitting there on the
[2:00:54] street they were in a little
[2:00:57] circle and they were having their
[2:00:59] Christmas
[2:01:06] dinner I remember that and I I still
[2:01:13] cry because at at my house I I had
[2:01:16] sufficient I
[2:01:19] had but I realized that not everyone has
[2:01:25] sufficient and this day of Christmas is
[2:01:27] not the happiest for many people there's
[2:01:29] people that
[2:01:33] suffer that's why it says in John
[2:01:36] 316 for God
[2:01:38] so love the world that he gave his only
[2:01:43] begotten
[2:01:45] son that whosoever believeth in him
[2:01:48] shall not be lost or shall not perish
[2:01:50] but has eternal life
[2:01:56] gifts gifts that not everyone
[2:01:59] has gifts that not everyone
[2:02:03] re gifts that there's people that don't
[2:02:05] have to
[2:02:06] give families that don't have who to
[2:02:09] spend Christmas
[2:02:11] with not even a home where to spend
[2:02:16] Christmas but God has given us in
[2:02:20] abundance
[2:02:22] remember those people and let us pray
[2:02:24] for them so that God can also give them
[2:02:30] Prosperity brother Bram on a certain
[2:02:35] occasion he was preaching at a
[2:02:40] convention but one day
[2:02:43] before he had spoken with a little
[2:02:48] girl a little girl that had
[2:02:50] polio
[2:02:53] and she had she had her her metal braces
[2:02:56] on and she used some special
[2:02:59] shoes she was a little girl but she
[2:03:01] wasn't that much a little
[2:03:04] anymore she was probably already going
[2:03:06] into her
[2:03:09] adolescence and her condition began to
[2:03:11] affect this little girl because she
[2:03:14] wanted to
[2:03:16] look but with those braces on her
[2:03:19] legs and those shoes
[2:03:23] she knew and she was
[2:03:26] suffering so then the prophet told
[2:03:29] her I want you to go to the
[2:03:31] meeting and I'm going to pray for you
[2:03:35] and God is going to heal
[2:03:38] you I want you to sit in the
[2:03:41] front so then the next
[2:03:44] day the prophet of God was
[2:03:47] preaching but before he went in to
[2:03:50] preach the prophet had a little box it
[2:03:54] was it was a little wrapped like a
[2:03:57] gift so he arrived at the pulpit and he
[2:03:59] put it up on the pole and he began to
[2:04:03] preach so the little girl was
[2:04:06] there where her polio braces were
[2:04:12] on her his her brother that was just
[2:04:14] behind
[2:04:15] her oh I mean his brother brother of the
[2:04:18] Prophet was seated behind
[2:04:20] him
[2:04:24] so then as as the the preaching was was
[2:04:26] going and and a time had already
[2:04:29] passed and the brother of the Prophet
[2:04:31] began to
[2:04:34] think he already forgot surely already
[2:04:36] forgot what he promised his little
[2:04:38] girl and the prophet continued
[2:04:42] preaching and the brother of the Prophet
[2:04:44] thought
[2:04:48] again already forgot the promise he made
[2:04:50] to this little girl
[2:04:52] and the prophet continued
[2:04:55] preaching and the third time this
[2:04:58] brother of the prophet he began to think
[2:05:01] the same
[2:05:03] thing already forgot what he promised
[2:05:06] this little
[2:05:07] girl so the prophet turned around and
[2:05:09] looked at his brother he said
[2:05:12] no I have not
[2:05:16] forgotten I haven't forgotten what I
[2:05:18] promised this little
[2:05:20] girl God God never forgets about his
[2:05:24] bride God never forgets his
[2:05:27] people so then he called the little
[2:05:29] girl and he prayed for
[2:05:33] her and the little girl was healed at
[2:05:35] that
[2:05:36] moment so that the prophet gave that
[2:05:39] gift to the little girl and the
[2:05:42] gift inside that
[2:05:44] present was a pair of new shoes normal
[2:05:49] shoes so that the little girl could use
[2:05:51] them
[2:05:54] a gift from
[2:05:56] God so then well 2,000 years
[2:06:00] ago the Lord Jesus Christ
[2:06:02] arrived please stand
[2:06:13] Brethren and within
[2:06:16] him there were
[2:06:20] gifts but he had them within him you
[2:06:26] see you notice how I opened up the
[2:06:34] gift well in that same way was the way
[2:06:36] Jesus Christ had to be
[2:06:38] treated to be able to take out the gift
[2:06:41] that was within
[2:06:47] him the Lord Jesus Christ was
[2:06:50] struck he was
[2:06:55] whipped on him a crown of thorns for our
[2:07:01] cause they whipped him up until he
[2:07:04] looked like chopped
[2:07:07] liver there wasn't one piece or point in
[2:07:11] his body that was it wasn't just one
[2:07:14] here and one
[2:07:16] there literally he was just chopped
[2:07:20] up to be able to take God's gift
[2:07:24] out that gift that was within
[2:07:27] him is the Holy
[2:07:30] Ghost the gift had to be
[2:07:34] open it had to be
[2:07:38] ripped that wrapping had to be ripped
[2:07:40] for that gift to be to
[2:07:43] us 50 days after that
[2:07:46] happened the gift was given unto the
[2:07:49] people there in that day at Pentecost
[2:07:52] there that gift arrived to the
[2:07:54] people what people had need
[2:07:58] of upon the people in the people within
[2:08:02] the
[2:08:04] people the same opportunity that we have
[2:08:08] today the same Holy
[2:08:11] Spirit gifts within
[2:08:14] himself within
[2:08:16] him he has
[2:08:19] Joy do somebody need Joy
[2:08:24] you feel depressed or
[2:08:27] sad but the Lord Jesus Christ has a gift
[2:08:29] for
[2:08:32] you the Holy Ghost is also the gift of
