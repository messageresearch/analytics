the man that walketh not in the counsel of the ungodly nor standeth in the way of Sinners nor sth in the Seal of the scornful but his Delight is in the law of the Lord and in his law doth he meditate day and night and he shall be like a tree planted by the rivers of water that bringeth forth his fruit in his season his Leaf shall also shall not wither and whatsoever he doeth shall prosper the ungodly are not so but are like the chaff which the wind driven away therefore the ungodly shall not stand in the Judgment nor sinners in the congregation of the right for the Lord knoweth the way of the righteous but the way of the ungodly Shall Perish if everyone would please stand and we will have our opening prayer dear heavenly father as we approach your throne of Mercy tonight oh Lord Oh

audience as such especially for Children's Service we welcome each and every one of you in the precious name of the Lord Jesus Christ and uh and I I believe our pastor and his lovely wife and would like to thank you for your your presence um we come to that part of um petitions and thanksgivings we don't have anything written but I I believe we we some of us have petitions I believe some of us have [Music] thanksgivings how many have Thanksgiving children do you have any thanksgivings yeah see brother brother Vega has Thanksgiving amen I have a Thanksgiving myself see uh I went through a hard trial this week and I wasn't able to smile as much and and by the grace of God he's letting me smile again and I thank the Lord for that so sometimes it's hard to smile all the time and uh so I thank the Lord for that but um if you be so kind uh as to stand with us we're going to be praying for the petitions the secret petitions that you have in your hearts the thanksgivings that we we just witnessed with the uplifting of your hand and the the tidings and the offerings that we're about to pick up let's bow our heads Lord and gracious Heavenly Father we love you Lord Jesus from the bottom of our hearts we love you Lord and we thank you for all that you have done for us all that you are doing for us and all that you will do for us for We Know by Thy word Lord Jesus that you are the same yesterday today and forever Lord Jesus there were a a lot of hands that went up Lord Jesus signifying that we we have a lot of petitions Lord maybe some were were too hard to write down on a piece of paper but the tablets of their of our hearts Lord [Music] Jesus they're they are there maybe it might be for a loved one or maybe it might be for a struggle maybe it might be mentally physically spiritually whatever it might be Lord we know that you have overcome Lord Jes we stand here as Witnesses Lord Jes believing in thy saving power Lord father that you heal Lord father that you heal physically Lord Jesus physical sickness Lord father but even greater than that Lord Jesus you heal diseases of the soul lord father you can heal the heart Lord Jesus and and and and when that is

[Music] bag all those millions of people that were in the desert not not one person got sick not not one person was feeble because he reached into that bag and in that bag that medicine bag was the promise of your word that said I am the Lord that Health thy disease so we we trust in that Lord father that we can go to that medicine bag as Moses did Lord father and you can answer our petition and you can give us what we have need of Lord father wants are different than needs Lord father and sometimes we we might want things Lord not understanding that it's not what we need Lord Jesus so we just ask you for those things that we need Lord father trusting in thee Lord father because we as children Lord we believe that we are children Sons and Daughters of the almighty King can be able to go to our Papa to our father and say daddy father we need of thee we we need you we need this or we need that Lord and I believe Lord father as a gracious father that you are who willing to give us peace Mercy Grace as according to thy measure that if we just ask Lord father your word says ask anything in my name you shall receive so we ask these things in thy name Lord Jesus we thank you for all the thanksgivings that we that we are able to give thanks for Lord father we thank you for that Lord Jesus Lord we are about to pick up the offering the we ask that you bless that Lord father

on the banks am in in look look we have Jesus here in a boat I love it Lord I'm inan I would love to tell a story to the people oh would you like to tell a story to the people just like just like in the old days would you guys like to tell a story to the people would you guys like Jesus to tell you a story how many knew that Jesus would preach and tell stories he spoke in Parables a parable is a story everybody say a parable is a story so we can understand spiritual things so so Jesus just like he was on a boat did you know even though he told stories they weren't fish stories they were true stories his his disciples were fishermen right Jesus that's right now that you know that also they were fishermen of men yes Lord your mouth needs to move I know you're freaking me out Lord okay please Lord I'm human and my mind is finite unless did you guys all hear that see we heard it and his mouth didn't even move that's so spiritual we must be so spiritual we heard the still Small Voice and his mouth didn't even move that's how we need to be in our everyday life even and if we don't see Jesus mouth move if you hear him talk to your heart then don't steal the cookie go ahead yes she just tell us a story wellow I you were saying something about about your disciples what were you going to say well they were they were fishermen of men did you know what that means who knows what official knows what that means who knows what that means raise your hand if you know what official brother Ernie knows Jonah knows as soon as I called somebody's name out I saw like 10 people put their hand down I'm not calling on you I'm just saying who knows so who knows Rachel thank you for raising your hand can you please come I'm just kidding I'm just kidding but yes who so can somebody tell us this what a fisher of men is who wants to be brave and tell us oh aren't you so glad that nobody's ashamed of your gospel lord it's awesome to be in this church who who wants to tell us what a fisher of men is I do I do okay I'll do it a fisher of men is H Jesus [Laughter] I'll try to put it this way well when we fish for fish what do we do we try to catch the fish but a fisher of men the Lord Jesus called us to catch men and souls for the gospel that's right Professor Theo we must capture the hearts of the people yes amen and you would use Parables to do that wouldn't you yes that's right are you going to tell us a parable I am so so we're going to hear right now Jesus is going to be a fisher of men he's going to throw the net out tell us a story with the bait and if you have an ear to hear and you bite the bait then then then Jesus is going to real Us in isn't that amazing that that reminds me of a song can you give me mhm it goes like this I'm going to sing it first and

many loveita she's so [Applause] cute so how many of you have heard ever the story of the Good Samaritan can you raise your hand yeah so as you all know our Lord created the heavens the Earth and he created every creature that walks the land every bird in the air and also every fish in the sea yes also the Sharks now can you imagine how awesome is our God that he created fishes of Many Colors many shapes all kinds of sizes just like people just like people that's right but they came out and they will swim around that's the way of praising their creator they will swim around and they will come all out and they will swim and swim and show their pretty colors just like the way they're going to do right now now that's right just like way they going to come out and swim maybe they're just a little shy come on guys let's swim keep on swimming can we give the fish a round of applause they're shy come on Turtles let's swim a little [Applause] bit look how beautiful the turtles look so then now I was telling you the story of the Good Samaritan right right there was two types of fish there were the jewfish and also they were the Samaritans now they did not like each other they were always bicker they will fight whenever they will see each other in the sea they will try to avoid each other fishy it's okay don't be shy what's going on oh they're chasing the poor poor little SE Sam oh no they're being mean they don't like her oh wow how little samarin how many think that's okay how many you think is bullying someone it's okay no no you think it's okay to bully someone because you don't like them or because they're smaller no you think that's okay no no that's good to hear now now also the little fishes will swim around in the sea but there was also bigger fish in the sea they were the mean ones not so much bad but a little mean just a little they were bullies oh no so I would imagine that just like on a normal day in the ocean the little fishes were out come on out and they're swimming look at the little sea urant the Yellow Sea urants they're just going on their day you know swimming in this big old ocean right Jesus that's right so we have little crabs but what happened wasn't it dangerous in the ocean Jesus that's right they were all so dangerous fish bigger fish with big sharp teeth have you guys heard this uh I don't know this song have you heard this song I think we could imagine it a little better Jesus if we had the sound effects that's right there they are oh know [Music] no how many of us have ever been scared look over there Lord what do I do now the sharks are the bullies of the sca they're mean they don't they bully people can you think of someone that bullies us here in [Music] Earth there's a lot of bullies lord well there's one in particular that I would like to tell you about the devil that's right it's the devil the devil is mean he doesn't care about us he just wants to take everything away from us he wants to eat us and devour us and destroy us just like that shark right there he wants to eat all the little fish oh no no he tries to act friendly but then when you [Music] expected now there was this little particular turtle that was going to go on a trip and he was so happy he was singing for Joy cuz he was going to go on this trip he had his money he had his food and he was going to go to Hawaii oh and the little turtle was swimming and swimming and swimming and he was thinking about his strip and he did not see that I can't wait to go ha to Hawaii going to have some coconut juice and get a suntan it's going to be nice but then all of a sudden the bullies came around sound effects oh no people now at first they were very friendly they were asking them oh where are you going you want to be my friend but it was all an act that's what they want to make you think they thinking I want to play but then all of a sudden the jellyfish stung oh no no no and they started attacking him they started taking away his food started taking away his money they were just very very mean to this poor little turtle that's not nice no no no that's a bad choice oh no do that that's just like bullies they'll beat somebody up and they'll laugh at him so are you guys going to laugh at him why are you looking so green Turtle so then they took off so they swam away leaving the poor little turtle to die oh no everybody say Boo sharks boo boo shark why do you have like a thousand fins boo now who knows what happens next in our story you know you know you know any anybody knows what happens next no do you know what's next I

business I'll I'll help him but I got I got to run the temple I'll pray for you buy at the temple sorry I [Music] leave that way which way that [Laughter] way oh no no no now if he was really in the Lord's business he would have known that he was going to help him instead yeah je was that guy in the Lord's business really he didn't even help him no that's right no come on guys so what happens next well another one of the turtle friends came came about man does he go to the same church as the last guy no was the church but not the same one oh my goodness oh she looks nice I'm sure she'll oh no there might be sharks jellyfish they're going to kill me oh no what a scary cat nobody wants to help the poor little turtle I know that is so sad oh Lord you don't know how to swim no for that's a good idea let's listen to the rest of the story come on Jesus well if the priest and the religious Turtle did not help him there's no more hope right no one can help that's not nice I just I think maybe there's someone else I see someone coming around the B did you see anyone else no is anybody going to help this poor little turtle a wait a minute this little saman and her best friend but they don't like each other and also aren't they enemies yes that turtle was mean to the little Samaran and with the little seahorse as well they were throwing water Pebbles and and blowing bubbles they were chasing them around a I wonder how they feel about this oh no what do we do we can't just leave him here even though he's not our enemy yeah but there might be sharks and jolly and scary stuff that might eat us well let's just help him see what if he would be nice to us wow that is amazing they didn't care about the sharks they didn't care about the jellyfish they only care that that person needed help wow they didn't want to let him there to die and be fried Turtles but they were Brave now the little Samaritan it tended to the turtles wounds took care of them fed them as well give him something to eat something to drink um they were in the ocean but yes something to drink I it's okay aita now with the help of the little seor friend they carry him away to an inn wow so the good samarin put the hurt turtle on her own horse that's right that's awesome look at this pretty little fish is that the inkeeper come over here inkeeper so you can talk in the microphone [Music] hello how may I help you hi we have someone that you could you take care of yeah we can take care of the person no no T it it's a turtle um we're in the [Music] ocean oh I'm sorry I forgot now imagine that the the little Samaran not only helped the poor little turtle on the way they took her to an inn they paid the iner so that they can care for him nurse him back to health and so that the little turtle can return to the family that's right wow um and if here's some money if here's some silver coins and just in case if you guys need any more when I come back I'll give you more so he can get well wow so that little owner of the holiday fin Express had her hands full she was going to take the little turtle and take care of him and the Samaran gave her all the money that she needed isn't that nice
