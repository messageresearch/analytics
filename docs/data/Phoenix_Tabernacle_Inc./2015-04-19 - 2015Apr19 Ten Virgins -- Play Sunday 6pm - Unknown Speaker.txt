Jesus and also the the drama that's that will be coming up Lord Jesus to to be able to portray the the portion of your word that you have for us tonight Lord Jes in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ amen you may take your seats I've learned that there's three kinds we we all know this and and if I'm and if it's a I I I love children's [Music] church and and if it's if it goes over your head a little bit I'm I'm really sorry we're trying to be [Music] obedient um but I I believe that even in your age if the Holy Spirit can reveal to reveal to you just something that it's been a blessing for us all right I I learned in in a church even and if you just type it to yourself uh there's three kinds of Believers we know that right there's a a Believer make believer and you got your non-believer well um and um I had a question is it possible that you can be all three of them all at once well it happened to me where I was living at in that and I was living that about six years ago um I had just gone out of jail and uh and I was on fire I had made a decision in my life that I was going to serve God with all I that I could I made a promise and um and so I I I had this promise in my heart and I knew that I couldn't go back on it and then one day after a youth service I went and I asked a brother and I said brother do you think I have the new birth and he says well what do you think I said well I I think I do I I I feel that I yeah I think I do I just want to tell you something if you got to ask somebody if you if you got something like that wake wake up to what to what's really happening you know when you know you'll know there's no doubt there's no you have to ask somebody you don't going to have to ask your mama or your daddy you don't have to go ask your pastor you don't you don't have to ask nobody you just know so then I I left that day I was like man well I got it man I got the new birth that's I knew I had it so I left five years went by and uh I started to notice like all these mistakes that I would make you you know uh in an intellectual birth when you when you have a birth that's intellectual you you live foolishly in contrast to a real birth you you you do nothing but think with your own head in your own ways you know what I know the word says this but I just can't overcome it it's just it's hard for me in my life right now when you have the new birth I don't care what you're going through and you get tired of just some you get tired of something you're struggling with you just say that's enough that's it you know when I make a mistake now and I and it comes to my attention I feel I feel really bad and sometimes my wife corrects me or a brother will correct me I said oh my God I didn't mean to do that I didn't mean to say that and before I would just say well that's just where I'm at right now you know and then the mistake would happen again and then it would happen later on so here I had like these these you know my my own way of of of living a a a new birth type of life you know you have your own gifts you have your own confidence everything on your own and although you confess with your mouth you say well I'm this I got the new birth because I I felt it your actions your fruits show what you really are and I and it was so confusing because here I was I believed I believe that I had the new birth but here I was uh make believing because if you believe the word then you live the word see you you you believe it or you unbelieve it so here I was really it was it was a confusion so then I come to the altar you know as the years would go by or I'd be in the back or I'd be at home or I'd be at work and I and it would be like why am I doing this or why did I do that or why did I say that if I really believed it see it was just it was just intellectual you know um I believe I was maybe this close I was this close to have received a new birth those five years back but what I should have done instead of asking somebody I should have just I should have got all that doubt out I should have came to the altar I should have went to the word I should have went to the message and I should just start digging and digging and digging you know when you have a genuine real birth you don't have to ask somebody if you got it the holy spirit will prove it through you the Life of Christ through you the way you walk the way you talk the way you act like a Christian you're you're you're living like a Christian and I never really I never really took the time to analyze my life and to say okay today I did this and I did this all right next day I did this man I did it again man okay and then the next day I did this and I did this last week I never took the time to analyze you know you can make yourself believe you can make yourself believe that you got something and you don't got it you can say you believe but you don't believe but here I was I was a Believer I come up a nice song leader I give my testimony you know on the mission field let me be honest with you I would do with all my heart I I really would it wasn't a fake I I want you think that oh man this guy was just a hypocrite that's the last thing I wanted to do but the word will separate that the word separates it'll separate a make Believer from a real believer it'll separate a non-believer from a real believer now I learned this from our our I learned this from my Apostle my pastor and I I say it because I I take it personal and we all have to do the same thing that in in in the class of Believers we have two different we have two different sections let's see on this side we have the foolish virgins and on that side we have the wise virgins they're both believers they both believe in the message both believe in Malachi 45 they they believe in the word but there's just just just that little something that just that one word that is separate or it can just be not having enough oil in your lamp oh you know what maybe tomorrow I'll give it all to Jesus maybe next week I don't I don't feel I can do it right now I made so many mistakes I I I I know I have these problems I know I'm weak I just I can't do it maybe maybe I'll go to the Altar and it doesn't have to be this altar right right here this Altar and I'll just give it all up I'll just give it to the Lord Jesus Christ you know the Lord Jesus Christ now he he broke me down know he took away anything that I had as a man I mean he he tried to take away my health you know if I don't take medicine and that's God's way of healing okay for people who say oh man that's against my belief medicine is here for a reason God works through medicine medicine doesn't heal God heals but so you know here here I was that that I I had had no Health you know my spirit was broken I was spiritually sick I mean I mean just to the point where I didn't want to just I don't want to go to church no more and and to top it off when I used to feel like that at least I had a mind I had confidence that I was still a man that I I'll be all right I still had this you know I'm Benji I'm still going to make it tomorrow and then one day God said okay I'm going to take your mind now I'm GNA crush it I'm gonna I'm gonna burst it I'm GNA break it so he here I was I had no confidence in myself let me tell you when you don't have no confidence in yourself have you never been there and you never have to be there that's great you know but God will take you to the place where he needs to take you to do what he has to do for with you see if he wants to use you in such a way the full capacity he'll break you down to where you say I don't got nothing no more I I don't got a physical health man I don't got spiritual strength I don't even got a mind a strong mind I don't got no confidence I don't trust nobody don't trust my mom my dad my my wife anybody who talk to me at the barber shop I don't trust them everybody's talking about me you start going crazy and God allowed this God allowed this he allowed this he allowed for me to get to this point where I had nothing more and I said Lord I mean what what do you do this for why do you break me down like this he said is are you done are you done trying you got nothing left in you said I'm done I'm done trying nothing left in me he smiles he smiled at me back there I remember the service he smiled at me he said that's where I want you that's where I want you I want to put my Holy Spirit in you so I make you walk the way I want you to walk I want you to talk the way I want you to talk you see your mind that you have I don't want your stinking mind I want my mind in you where I was at broken down I had nothing to offer then God said with a beautiful smile that's where I want you you see when you don't cut off those things of the world those little habits all you're doing is allowing for a bad burn we're talking about a lamp right now in a lamp you have a wick inside okay and and when this when when when the lamp go when you turn it off there there's this carbon that's created and if you don't trim it if you don't trim it the next time you light it it's it it burns gets all smoky this gets all Smokey and all black and it and it stinks and it gets all over your face it's you got to trim your lamps now that now we're just barely getting to the point to becoming one of a Believer I barely came to that point where I'm a Believer now and being a Believer you I mean we talked about it last week probably because of the camp and I went through it I had a horrible time last week horrible I mean it was all going on in here he started manifesting in here right on last Sunday I didn't want to come to church and and somehow by the grace of God just something snapped just said just go so I went and I sat right there and brother Mona preached a wonderful message and what I realized was that I needed a refilling you know when when when your lamp when the oil runs out you it might be full in one point it could be full at one point and you can burn it all night long and and then it possibly go the next day but when it goes out you got to put more oil in there if if it runs out of oil you got to put more oil in there and how do you do that I don't know God knows how to do it though God he's a he's a lamp filler he he can fill up your Reservoir he can fill up your vessel we can get to that point where you finally become a Believer you know and by the the grace of God working your way up by the grace of God grace growing in you and then and then you can just get to that point and you're walking around defeated what's going on I don't feel like going to church today well you need a refilling brother you need a refilling sister don't be foolish don't be foolish don't be a dummy think about it be wise about it do what you have to do to refill yourself up and he says come come fill up your lamps be wise about it be wise about it come fill yourself up you can be filled with the Holy Spirit one day and then you can be empty the next day you know not the day when the bridegroom cometh you I you know what I mean it's got to be a daily thing it's got to be a daily battle this isn't oh I got it one time and I'm good no man you got to do it daily daily come to the word come to the message you know and those believe and and I'm about to finish brother I'm Sor forgive me you know and those those those two those Believers the foolish and the wise they they both knew how to trim their lamp their wits they both knew how to get right they they knew right from wrong they both knew how they knew the message man they know the word man they're believers they knew how to do it man I shouldn't be doing that all right let me drink a can of L get right let me get right I'm not talking about Li I'm talking you know I'm talking about let's let me start living right again so then they they know how to trim their lamps you know because when they were then we when they were asleep they were Slumber they were asleep they arose they trimmed their they trimmed their lamps they they knew the word they knew the message there was just one difference one had oil and the other didn't one was watchful they were they were watching what were they watching don't be watching everybody else watch your own walk your your own life watch how you live don't be focusing on everybody else although you want to live for others but focus on what you're doing on a daily thing how am I living how am I acting how am I talking am I doing everything for Christ am I ready if they call me if they call me to serve am I ready am I ready to serve and if they call me am I ready oh brother I'm sorry man I just I can't do it today I just had a bad day next week brother next week I'll be there are you ready to serve at any given moment you could be called upon you not you know not the hour that the bridegroom cometh so get yourselves ready trim your lamps trim them up get your life right and not only that fill yourself with oil fill yourself with the Holy Spirit how do you do that you come to the feet of the Lord Jesus Christ know that you are weak and you're weakness I am made strong that's what the word says right if the drama could start coming up you know when I had nothing to offer no more when I knew that I was weak and this and this and that that's when God said perfect now I'm ready to use you now I'm ready to show my strength through you now I'm ready to fill you with the Holy Ghost because you're going to do what I want you to do you're not going to live foolishly you're not going to live according to your own ways that's how it is sometimes we think that we know how to do it we think because we know it all we got it all just type up oh yeah but man says this okay you I mean the Pharisees the SES s man they were they walked a perfect life I mean even more virtuous than Jesus brother Bram says it they they even lived a more virtuous life than I I don't get that but they were lacking in one thing they were lacking in the spirit they had the word I mean they they were able to live the word but they were lacking in the spirit man shall not live by by by the by The man shall live not live by bread alone but by every word that comes out of the mouth of God man should not live by just the Bible I'm substituting words there okay but by every word man should not just live by the message but by every word man should not just live by fruits but by every word that comes out of the mouth of God you might not understand this but you got to have a balance you just can't be all religious and you can't be all you know Pentecost I'm gonna dance and I'm gonna shout I'm gonna show everybody I got it you got to be in balance with the word let's get our lives right let's trim our lamps and let's get a refilling God bless you amen amen hallelujah amen can you hear me is the mic on you guys can hear me praise God how many enjoyed that testimony amen how many can say amen amen amen we need to fill up our lamps amen am um the drama's getting ready they're in the back they're prepared all things are all things are ready now I love that song I'm I'm really weird I think in music the play is going to start don't get confused when I start acting because I'm part of the part of the drama okay so if we uh can just everybody Sing With Me This Little Light of Mine and as you're singing This Little Light of Mine the play will start amen This Little Light of Mine I'm [Music] gonna sh oh this is good oh this is good I feel inspired he's coming back for a Perfect Bride and when he arrives even the dead in Christ shall rise got a have enough oh your Lord help my heart be ready right as I ready myself for when he arise let me ready myself for when he [Music] arise oh my gosh I just get so excited when I read the word of God God sometimes I get inspired to write a song and the Lord just comes down amen you want to know what inspired me you want to know you got to look it up for yourself oh man I want to where's my phone at I'm G text because he's as crazy as I am my wife should be here any minute hi Bab hey babe you scared me how you doing I just got back from SAS oh I know I uh used our credit card honey I know I saw the post on Facebook well you're not going to believe what happened what happened okay I ran into sister Flores at s Brenda's always at sass no no no no but but you're never going to believe this she asked me to make her a wedding dress oh I know so I went shopping nice isn't it beautiful very pretty oh my goodness look at this and I I bought so much fabric babe you're not going to believe oh that's gorgeous I am going to believe it God works in mysterious ways I was just reading about the remnant and the bride and and and the dress and how the bride uh gets herself ready well I'm going to have a hard job I mean I have to cut out the pattern lay it to the fabric but I don't know which parts of the fabric to choose I mean it oh it's so beautiful how do I pick which parts to use well it's simple you just use the pattern and and you cut it out I mean you're not going to use all of it even though it's beautiful like but you don't have to throw it away I'm sure it could be used for something else but it doesn't belong in the dress but it's just as good as the fabric that's going to be part of the dress babe of course like we got to read this scripture together it'll explain everything see the material is just as good because it's the exact same material see you you can't just say one part of the material is better than the other cuz they look exactly the same the difference is Babe predestination chose to use certain parts of this material for the dress and the other parts the the other REM The Remnant they're just as good but they're not part of the dress babe so you mean I just have to cut yeah you're dra dra line just going to have to make little like cup holders or something with the rest of the fabric it's still good fabric right it is okay so let me get this yeah I was just reading and then the lord gave me this song and it's still a work in progress but it's just about that it's about making yourself ready well this is what I chose to make the dress wow you're the fastest seams dress I've ever seen in my life you are hired man no wonder she called you for a last minute dress wow here come here so I can show you I'm reading questions and answers in Genesis okay listen to what brother Bram has to say cut out it's yours you lay the pattern it's God's business where he leavs the pattern he cuts you right out is that right and then all this rest of this Calico leure is just as good a Calico as in the dress is that right but it's God's election God elect his church God PR destinat his church God for or his church and he takes that church out and the rim that is that to go through the tribulation period [Music] uh Hey lamp keeper oh hello Dante
