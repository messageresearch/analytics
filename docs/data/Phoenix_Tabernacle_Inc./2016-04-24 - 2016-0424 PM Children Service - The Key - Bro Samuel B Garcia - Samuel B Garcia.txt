we'll pick up When we left off if you recall um in this particular series of exerts we've been doing since March of 2014 on the series of Books supernatural Will Brand we completed chapter 21 of Book two In which hope passed but We are so thankful that the lord gave brother Brandon and sister hope a glimpse of her Destiny That's quite a test as brother Brandon I'm sure felt at the time however there were more tests to come and so We Will Start Tonight chapter 22 first part of that chapter entitled the most treacherous moment of his Life 1937 ella Branham urged her son to Stay with her that First night after hope's Death She knew his children were Being watched by mrs broy but ella didn't want Bill to be Alone Bill said no he Wanted to go home even though there wasn't much there $10 would have bought everything in both rooms Still Still The little House was their House hope Had kept it Clean She Had touched it with her Love and Had transformed it from a cramped ordinary Rental unit into a warm inviting Home as soon as Bill walked through his front door he knew he Had made a mistake the Place Had no welcome no Life No Power to cheer Walking into the bedroom he looked on top of the folding Bed there underneath the newspaper laid The envelope Hope Had mentioned Bill dumped the nickels and dimes out on the Bed spread And countered them they totaled $280 Just 20 short of the down payment needed for that 22 Caliber rifle he Had been wanting for over a year Bill determined his Heart to put this Money down on that rifle and in spite of hundreds of Dollars in Medical Bills he owed he vowed he would make the monthly payments on that rifle until he owned it free and Clear in a Memory of his devoted wife he lay down on the Bed longing to escape into sleep a Mouse Had Found its way into The kitchen stove and rustled some kindling paper in the grates it sounded to Bill like hope Opening the wrappers of some Candy She Had kept up On A kitchen shelf he got up and Shut the kitchen door with his Foot there hung h's kono On A Hook behind the door now he realized he should have gone to his mother's House Everything here remind reminding him of his wife stretched out in the mor Bill buried his wet cheeks in the mattress and unleashed his grief a fist pounded urgently on the door Bill jumped up and let Frank bry and his son fletcher into the room Frank said Bill I've got some Bad news for you I know Frank I was with hope When She Died That's not All of it your baby is dying too Sharon Bill gasp Sur Yes drir just took her to the hospital She's got meningitis the doctor says She can't Live Come on I'll Drive you over there instead of moving Bill collapsed on the floor Frank and fletcher helped him up and outside into frank's pickup truck When Bill got to the hospital drir took him to the laboratory and let him look through a microscope at the fluid specimens drawn from Sharon spine It's tubular menitis said Dr sadly She picked It Up from her mother usually the tubercle stops in the lungs but sometimes it gets in the bloodstream and reaches the meninges That covers the brain That's What has happened to your daughter I'm sorry Bill but at this Point there's absolutely Nothing We can do for her where is She do I want to see her She's downstairs So You Can't Go see her She's infectious I don't care If I Die I've got to see Sharon One More Time with difficulty Dr kept his resolve You Can't Do it Bill menitis is highly contagious you could carry it out on your Coat and give it to Billy Paul Bill SAT down and buried his Face in his hand sobbing Just bring me some chloroform and let me Die with her What is Life To Me Now Everything I love is gone Dr his friend anguish as If it were his own Bill you stay here I'll get a nurse to bring you something that will ease the Pain as soon as Dr left the room Bill slipped out another door and made his way down to the basement Sharon Rose lay in a crib whimpering and jerking with muscle spasms a length of cheese cloth Had been draped over her Body as a mosquito net but her kicking and twisting Had pulled It Off and Now to eyes Suck the moisture from around her eyes Bill shwed the flies away and repositioned the netting Sharon he said softly When She turned her Head to Look at him her Lips began to quiver She Had suffered so hard that her eyes Had crossed Bill dropped to his knees closed his eyes and clasped his hands Together Oh Dear God he prayed you took my Darling wife and Now you're taking my baby Please don't Take my little girl I'm the one That's done wrong you should me I'm sorry That I Listen to someone Else instead Of You I'll try to Never Do it Again lord I'll go to them people that She called trash and backwash And I won't care Who calls me a Holy Roller I'll do Everything you want me to do only please Don't let my baby Die as soon as he opened his eyes he Saw What looked like a Black sheet dropping down between Sharon and himself he Had seen the same Thing praying for hope Last Christmas he knew that God Had refused his Prayer that Instant Was the most treacherous moment of his Life kneeling on the hard floor of that basement isolation ward with his nine-month old daughter dying before him det tempter came alongside And whispered You Say that God is love is this Love as much As you preached his Word and as hard as you've tried to live for him and Now When it comes down to your own Baby's Life he'll turn you down What kind of God do you serve anyway for a minute buil teeter precariously on the Great Divine then his answer came swelling up from some hidden fountain of strength Deep in his Soul like Job of old I'll say the lord gave and the lord hath taken away blessed be the name of the lord Oh God I don't know Why You're tearing me up like this but that doesn't change my Faith in you you even if you slay me yet I'll Trust you I believe in you he stood up for the last time and leaned over his daughter's crib Sharon after the Angels pack your soul yonder to meet Your Mother I'll bury you out here In Your mother's Arms amilia hope Branham was buried on Saturday July 24th 1937 at Walnut Ridge cemetery in a plot her Father Had purchased

Paul SAT on the steps and cried for his mother When Bill Finally gathered his strength to get up he took Billy Paul Back to the broy house and left him for the Night While he himself walked on toward

el hermano dijo Amén eso es Dios obrando no importa que pequeño esté queé joven esté que tan grande o que tan anciano de edad si lo pone en acción porquea Biblia hay muchas promesas y es promesas para obar usted es un hijo una hija de Dios usted tiene acceso a esas promesas Vamos a ponernos de pie para leer la palabra de Dios vamos Air escrituras a San Juan verso 10 capítulo 10 verso 7 Jesus pues

levante su mano Para qué se usa una [Música] llave es para abrir algo una puerta es no solamente para una puerta pero para tener acceso a algo es para eso es una llave es para des encarcelar algo o para tener acceso a algo o meterse en algo o abrir una puerta [Música] Si usted mira una llave tengo aquíes de la casa es no es la llave de mi hogar pero si trato de usar esta llave para abrir hogar que va servir no hay diferentes llaves por diferentes propósitos si mira una llave tiene una figura y cada llave tiene una diferente figura la L para mi automóvil quisiera que mi llave no mu sombroso gusta me gustar quea abrir otro automóvil no puede es hecha de cierta manera hecha para un cierto carro la llave usada es una pregunta muy sencilla quizás le puede pasar por la cabeza cómo puede ser una llave Cómo puede usar una llave con su mano Necesito una mano para usar la llave si dejo mis llaves allí cre que va a empezar Así mismo yo sé la tecnología de hoy en día aar un botón pued hablarle al llavero puede decirle prende mi carro no tengo de ese tipo de automóvil ent para Us para mió para mi hogar Necesito una mano si tenía de chango Quiz pued usar pies pero no tengo patas de chango Alguien tiene que usar la llave este mico ese micrófono cree que puede usted oír algo a través de ello si alguien no lo estaba usando por no porque está mudo no puede oír nada de ello tengo que estar cerc de él per mi voz decir amol me pueden oír ahora ese micrófono puesto en obra tiene que tener una mano de fe una mano de fe para usar esas promesas que están aquí y no solamente Abre cualquier puerta tipo de puerta abre laer cualquier puerta que usted necesite lo que necesita usted Ne correcto que tener fe para usar esa llave es va ser de usted leos esitur [Música] yo soy la [Música] puerta puedo usar por muchas cosas llaves quizás la llave para el conocimiento aquí personas en la iglesia que tienen el conocimiento o la enseñanzas muy elevadas muy inteligentes y han puesto su su mente a trabajar y han estudiado estudiado y estudiado y se han hecho doctores abogados Quiz un peluquero no pued ser un peluquero sin estudiar y cuando yo entré la escuela de peluquero era muy difícil para m porque tenía que estudiar y ponerme mi mente a trabajar no importa quier aprender hay una llave del conocimiento cuando Ed lo tenga saben cre la bombilla de luz voy preguntarle dos personas [Música] todavía es gran invación muy grande él creó la bombilla de luz él tomó una llave adentro de su mente de su cabeza él creyó que iba a ser posible y continuó trabajando trabajando trabajando y una bombilla de luz se encendió y él creó la bombilla de luz como la música hay otros que pueden cantar muy bien que pueden tocar los instrumentos muy bien y creen que ustedes ustedes creen que ellos se convirtieron buenos en su primera en su primera ocasión yo tengo unos cuantos músicos en la casa y tratan y tratan y tratan y mira có se mejoran poco a poco y es tan suave ell y siguen adelante y va a ser una edad que van a ser asombrosos como los músicos que tenemos aquí en la iglesia mú igles pero no pasó a través de una noche tomó mucho sudor mucho trabajo duro quizás pensaron en dejarlo yo no quiero hacer esto y luego y luego algo se encendió Oh Eso está fácil puedo hacer esto tomaron la llave había un hombre que podía escribir libros de de cómica porque quería escribir un libro de [Música] cómico y fue con alguien en Kansas City en la ciudad de Kansas y le mostró su trabajo el hombre Lo miró no eso no está bien y el hombre se desanimó trabaj en otra vez y otra vez lo di edita el trabajo está muy muy bien pero no él no se quedó allí pero él agarró una una un poco una porción pequeña del cómico de la iglesia y él rentó ese garaje que tenía un montón de ratas y ahí y empezó a mirar las ratas su curiosidad se empezó a levantar en él inventó un cómico y le nombró Mickey Mouse pueden creer ello han escuchado lugar disy del mundo de dis puede imaginar que hay un mundo de disne una locura Mickey en la iglesia grande lo que se ha convertido este carácter personajes y é tenía una llave que no que se quería deshacer de ella y algo d ahí se encendió y el hombre es muy exitoso si usted tiene una llave si usted tiene una llave Y si usted piensa que esa llave es importante usted piensa que va a haber algo importante detrás de esa puerta quizás un tesoro usted no hubiera encerrado basura imagínes si usted tiene un cuarto y Ed la cierra nadie entra allí porque tengo un montón de basura dentro no se hubiera un poco raro eso hac rascarse la cabeza por qué Por qué papá por qué por qué le pones candado a esa es a ese garaje es un montón de basura de esa persona le significa algo para ello hay una puerta es una puerta muy especial y no solamente es una una puerta pero es esa puerta hay esa puerta de sanidad Como dijo la hermana se por una cosa y otra por la gracia de Dios puede obtener esa revelación que Dios sana y para mí eso es sobresaliente como alguien tan joven o anciano para agarrar esa revelación que Dios sana hay muchas personas que sufren toda su vida que sufren toda su vida Y quizá estén enfermos encarcelados porque no han pido podido agarrar esa llave es una cosa muy que deprime porque no queremos nadie que se encarcelado no queremos que nadie esté enfermo hay una puerta para sanidad la palabra [Música] dice yo soy el señor que sana todas sus enfermedades Y si usted puede agarrarse de esa palabra esa promesa como la her lo hizo y agarrarse de [Música] y dijo el señor puede sanar mi enfermedad mi enfermedad sanar mi mente y lo puede agarrar eso a través de la fe y Agar esa llave y le da vuelta a esa hay una puerta de paz ahora ustedes jovencitos quizás ahorita sus vidas son muy pasibles o si no son pero yo conozco a alguien que les puede dar la paz aquí hay padres adultos y quizás al un momento de su vida quizás muchas ocasiones en sus vidas que estaban atravesando un tiempo muy difícil y no había paz en su vida Cuando miraron sus hijos sufriendo o cuando miraron un amado sufriendo uno que está uno amado que está viviendo en las calles sabiendo que esa persona no en paz Quiz usted piensa que ellos Quiz est en paz ustedes piensan que el dinero les da Paz popular alg pi eso tampoco es ayudarle de las personas más ricas este mundo no tien el señor Jesucristo en sus vidas en ese último día nos Y ustedes piensan que ellos quizás tenían paz en su vida es posible si se hicieron bien con el señor pero eso no le trae Paz hay una puerta al cielo una puerta Quién quiere ir al cielo todas las manos se levantaron am hay una puerta al cielo quién piensa que es esa puerta jes hay una puerta al cielo tiene que tener fe tiene que creer que Ed es un hijo o hija de Dios Y usted tiene que caminar digno del Evangelio tiene que vivir una vida Usted que pued llegar al cielo hacer un travieso toda su vida va a ser muy difícil Yo sé que tenemos aquí que trabajan 11 [Música] horas yo fui una un travieso un travieso por muchos años de mi vi por muchos años de mi vida muchos per porque encontré el señor Jesucristo ha entrado a mi vida y me ha mostrado una diferente manera de vivir actuar como un cristiano caminar como un cristiano hablar como un cristiano y es un milagro mismo y si usted ti un tiempo difícil haciendo ninguna de esas cosas yo le sugiero que usted encuent esa llave usted busque por esa llave porque hay un tesoro detrás de esa puerta hay tesoros más allá de lo que puede imaginar es un lugar que no se puede imaginar lo que se va a mirar no hay muerte no hay no hay desánimo quién le G quién le gusta llorar quién le gusta lágrimas te te vo a llorar dijo que sí Pobrecita por eso le dio Dios a ella como su padre ella es joven a nadie le gusta llorar nadie le gusta la angustia nadie le gusta la muerte nadie quiere estar el infierno tiene que estar insano para pedir por esas cosas voy una escritura no tiene que abrir a ella pero en esa escritura dice esto y dice as vivo muer aquí que vivo por los siglos de los siglos am yo tengo las llaves de la muerte y deando en la cruz conoc la historia conocen la historia Cuando Jesús murió con la historia cuando fue infierno hizo él tomó las llaves
