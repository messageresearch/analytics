[12:50] god bless you tonight it is really a
[12:55] privilege and an honor for me to be able
[12:57] to share with you the next reading in
[13:00] our series of sequential excerpts from
[13:03] the series of books supernatural life of
[13:05] William Branham we're in book three the
[13:07] men of his Commission 1946 to 1950 by
[13:10] Owen Jorgensen it's been a while since I
[13:12] read the last part of this so they kind
[13:14] of catch you up on what had happened to
[13:15] this point before we get started
[13:17] brother Branham was in Jonesboro
[13:19] Arkansas 1946 was the year the chapter
[13:24] is 33 a prayer line 8 days long he was
[13:27] in approaching the font what would be
[13:29] the final afternoon of the eighth day of
[13:31] this prayer campaign in Jonesboro
[13:33] Arkansas he had not seen system ADA for
[13:36] quite some time
[13:37] she took a train to Jonesboro he got
[13:40] word at the church that she had arrived
[13:42] so several brothers accompanied brother
[13:44] Brandon to go pick up made up and so
[13:47] when we pick up the chapter we'll start
[13:50] before we start however I do have
[13:52] several comments I'd like to make that
[13:54] are very important I think for all of us
[13:56] to realize we serve a God that is no
[14:01] respecter of persons and what that
[14:03] really means many people misinterpret
[14:05] that what that means is he doesn't see
[14:07] skin color he doesn't see our religion
[14:10] our politics he doesn't see our hair
[14:13] color our nationality but he does see
[14:17] our heart and we're so thankful for that
[14:20] I believe this particular part of this
[14:24] chapter the last six pages were going to
[14:26] finish tonight is evidence event
[14:34] a gang of Usher's met them assisting
[14:36] them through the jostling crowd and into
[14:38] the building just inside the door bill
[14:41] noticed a man waving a blue cap to catch
[14:43] his attention bill moved close enough to
[14:46] ask are you calling to me sir
[14:48] the man clenched his hat nervously
[14:50] aren't you brother branham he asked yes
[14:53] I am but I shouldn't pray for anyone out
[14:56] here or I'll calls a Rutgers if you can
[14:58] get in the prayer line out oh I'm not
[15:00] seeking prayer for myself the man
[15:02] explained I'm an ambulance driver today
[15:04] I brought an elderly patient down from
[15:06] Missouri very ill she's dying out there
[15:09] in my ambulance I think she may may
[15:12] already be dead I can't find a doctor
[15:14] anywhere and I don't know what to do
[15:16] could you come to her sir they wouldn't
[15:19] take my word to pronounce her dead you
[15:21] need to call an undertaker the driver
[15:23] pressed him I wish you would come with
[15:25] me
[15:26] her husband is frantic and maybe you
[15:27] could quiet him down bill knew where the
[15:30] ambulance was parked the traffic police
[15:32] had designated a certain area
[15:33] exclusively for ambulances I don't think
[15:36] I could even get to the woman there must
[15:38] be 2,000 people between us in those
[15:40] ambulances we'll help you offered one of
[15:43] the four Usher's so bill agreed to go
[15:45] which with much apologetic pushing in a
[15:47] great deal difficulty they finally
[15:49] reached the row of ambulances parked
[15:51] against a curb the four uh sure stayed
[15:53] outside while bill and the driver opened
[15:55] the door and climbed into the ambulance
[15:56] there an old man knelt over a limp body
[16:00] of a wrinkled woman the man's shirt was
[16:02] patched his overalls were faded his
[16:05] socks showed through the soles of his
[16:07] shoes
[16:07] a week's growth of beard covered his
[16:09] tired face he sent hunched over moving
[16:12] his head slightly back and forth sobbing
[16:14] Oh mother mother why did you leave me
[16:16] the way the man clenched his tattered
[16:19] straw hat reminded Bill of his own dad
[16:21] what's the matter sir the old man looked
[16:24] up are you the doctor no I'm brother
[16:28] branham old brother branham poor mother
[16:30] he looked back down to the motionless
[16:32] woman on the cot I've lost her I'm sure
[16:34] she quit breathing awhile ago she wanted
[16:37] to see you so bad before she died she
[16:40] was such a good wife to me she raised my
[16:42] children and hoed those fields beside me
[16:45] and helped me every step of the way she
[16:47] got cancer in her
[16:48] organs a few years ago we took her to
[16:50] st. Louis so the doctors could operate
[16:52] on her but it didn't do no good she kept
[16:55] getting worse he looked back at bill and
[16:57] his voice betrayed his bitter
[16:59] disappointment this morning we were
[17:01] listening to the radio and we heard a
[17:03] man testified that he had been blind for
[17:05] 10 years and that after you pray for him
[17:07] he could see I thought maybe a miracle
[17:09] can happen like that for us we didn't
[17:12] have any money left because I spent all
[17:13] my savings on the operation but I sold
[17:16] some quilts she had made and some
[17:18] blackberries she had canned and I hired
[17:19] this ambulance to bring her to Jonesboro
[17:22] he looked sadly back down at his wife
[17:24] now she's dead and I don't know what I'm
[17:27] going to do without her I'll be so
[17:29] lonesome as comfortingly as he could
[17:32] bill said well Dan the only thing I can
[17:35] do for you is all for prayer bill didn't
[17:38] know if the woman was dead or not she
[17:40] certainly looked in the ambulance driver
[17:42] had taken her false teeth out of her
[17:43] lips at something way back she had what
[17:46] looked like muddy water in her eyes her
[17:48] forehead felt cold and sticky to Bill's
[17:50] touch he took her right hand in his left
[17:53] and felt for her pulse he could not find
[17:56] it and as further proof that she must be
[17:58] dead Bill's left hand cannot detect any
[18:00] vibrations from the cancer bowing his
[18:03] head bill calmly said dear Lord Jesus I
[18:05] pray you'll be merciful to this brother
[18:08] help him and bless him into this woman
[18:11] who came all the way believing that he
[18:14] thought he felt a woman squeeze his hand
[18:16] opening his eyes he studied her closely
[18:18] she looked like a corpse it must have
[18:21] been his imagination or perhaps the
[18:23] twitching of the dead woman's muscles
[18:24] bill closed his eyes and continuing his
[18:27] prayer but a few moments later he felt
[18:29] her squeeze his hand again this time he
[18:32] knew it was for life he opened his eyes
[18:34] and studied her face the skin on her
[18:37] forehead wrinkled she opened her eyes
[18:39] and looked up in him bill didn't say a
[18:41] word the old man still had his eyes shut
[18:44] wringing his hands his head pointed up
[18:46] toward the ceiling
[18:49] the woman raised her head slightly and
[18:52] said to bill what's your name
[18:54] I'm brother branham the old man jerked
[18:57] his head around and cried in
[18:58] astonishment mother then he drew his
[19:00] arms around her and blood
[19:01] with joy mother mother as the color
[19:05] returned to the woman's cheeks billed
[19:06] noted that his left hand could still not
[19:09] detect any vibrations of cancer in her
[19:10] body that meant the disease was gone the
[19:14] old man's shouting had attracted the
[19:15] attention of some of the people outside
[19:17] the ambulance who were now pressing
[19:18] their faces to the glass the driver said
[19:21] to bill I think they figured out who you
[19:23] are you're gonna have trouble getting
[19:25] back in the building
[19:26] bill knew the driver was right he had
[19:29] been safe enough coming here because
[19:30] these people had never seen him before
[19:32] but most of them had been waiting days
[19:34] to get inside for prayer as soon as they
[19:37] knew he was in their midst the news
[19:39] would spread like wind driven fire and
[19:41] he would have a very difficult time
[19:42] getting back inside the auditorium an
[19:44] idea popped into his mind he said to the
[19:47] driver if you'll stand back with your
[19:49] back to that window and slowly take off
[19:51] your coat that will hide the inside of
[19:53] this ambulance just long enough for me
[19:55] to slip out of this other door if I can
[19:57] get away from here without being seen
[19:59] then I'll be all right nobody knows me
[20:01] outside I can move along the edge of the
[20:03] crowd to the back parking lot you'll
[20:05] have to tell the ushers to meet me back
[20:07] there I don't think I can get through
[20:08] the crowd and into the auditorium
[20:10] without her help I'll tell them said the
[20:12] driver he turned his back to the window
[20:14] so that had several faces pressed
[20:17] against it then he stretched slowly
[20:19] slipping his arm out of his coat
[20:20] effectively covering the little windows
[20:22] get going
[20:23] he said bill slipped quietly out the far
[20:26] side and hurried down the line of am
[20:28] useless too he reached the back parking
[20:30] lot electric floodlights illuminated the
[20:32] drizzle of rain that fell on the heads
[20:34] of several thousand men women and
[20:35] children who were crowding around the
[20:37] back doors of the auditorium bill felt
[20:40] completely anonymous since no one here
[20:42] had ever seen him before
[20:43] so rather than wait for the ushers to
[20:45] help him bill tried to make his way
[20:46] through the crowd by himself a husky
[20:49] voice said sharply quit pushing pardon
[20:52] me
[20:52] CID bill and kept trying to push his way
[20:54] forward a large rough-looking man turned
[20:56] around to face him I said quit pushing
[20:59] he growled yes sir
[21:02] bill said sheepishly excuse me backing
[21:05] up to the fringe of the crowd he
[21:06] wondered what he should do the ushers
[21:08] were nowhere in sight he heard a female
[21:11] voice hollering daddy daddy
[21:14] bill looked for the source of the crying
[21:16] saw a young colored girl about 17 years
[21:19] old pushing her way through a mass of
[21:21] white people she was obviously blind her
[21:24] eyes were white with cataracts even so
[21:27] because of the Jim Crow walls that
[21:29] segregated whites from blacks nobody
[21:31] nearby was willing to help her the girl
[21:33] groped her way through the crowd and
[21:35] Bill's general direction bill moved
[21:37] through the fringe of the crowd until he
[21:38] was directly in the girl's path soon she
[21:40] bumped into him excuse me she said but
[21:43] I'm blind enough lost my daddy could you
[21:46] help me find the bus from Memphis bill
[21:49] looked at the long road buses that were
[21:50] lined up at one end of the parking lot
[21:52] yes I can help you he said what are you
[21:55] doing here my daddy and I came to see
[21:58] the healer she replied how did you hear
[22:00] about him this morning I was listening
[22:02] to the radio and they had one man get on
[22:05] there and tell about how for years he
[22:07] couldn't speak a word and now he can
[22:09] talk another man said he had been
[22:11] drawing the blind pension for 12 years
[22:14] and now he could see so good he could
[22:16] read his Bible that gave me hope again
[22:18] for my sight when I was a little girl I
[22:20] got these cataracts on my eyes the
[22:22] doctor told me when I got older he could
[22:24] take them off but now that I'm older he
[22:26] says they've done wrapped around the
[22:27] optic nerves and he can't touch them so
[22:30] I don't have a chance unless I can get
[22:32] to the healer but tonight is the last
[22:34] night he'll be here and my and my daddy
[22:40] and I couldn't even get near the
[22:41] building now I've lost my daddy and I
[22:43] can't even get back to the bus kind sir
[22:46] would you please help me yes ma'am I
[22:49] will but first I'd like to question you
[22:51] about this he or you're talking about do
[22:53] you believe that God would send an angel
[22:55] and heal people today yes sir I do
[22:59] you mean you believe and even though we
[23:01] have so many fine doctors and hospitals
[23:04] around bill felt a little ashamed of
[23:06] himself for taking advantage of her
[23:07] blindness this way but he wanted to test
[23:09] her faith she quickly responded none of
[23:12] these doctors can help me sir if you'll
[23:15] take me by the hand and lead me to the
[23:16] healer then I can find daddy by myself
[23:18] bill could not keep up his pretense any
[23:21] longer
[23:22] sister maybe I'm the one you're supposed
[23:24] to see she grabbed the lapel of his coat
[23:27] and held on to it like a vise
[23:28] is you the he where she demanded no
[23:31] ma'am I'm brother branham the preacher
[23:33] Jesus Christ is the healer now if you'll
[23:37] take your hands off my coat and he took
[23:39] hold of her wrists to pull them away the
[23:41] girl held on with all her strength she
[23:43] had him and she wasn't gonna let him get
[23:46] away
[23:46] have mercy on me brother branham she
[23:48] begged sister would you let me hold your
[23:51] hand while I pray bill succeeded in
[23:53] prying one of the girls hands loose he
[23:55] felt the vibrations from the cataracts
[23:57] moving up his arm as he prayed dear
[24:00] Jesus one day you carried that old
[24:03] rugged cross bumping along the street
[24:05] blood running down your shoulders your
[24:08] little frail bodies staggering under the
[24:10] load a colored man by the name of Simon
[24:13] of Cyrene came up beside you picked up
[24:16] the cross and helped you bear it and now
[24:19] one of Simon's children is staggering
[24:21] here in the darkness I'm sure you
[24:24] understand the girl shuddered something
[24:27] just went through me she said her body
[24:28] quivering my eyes filled so cold bill
[24:32] felt the vibrations in his arm subsiding
[24:34] the demonic life had just gone out of
[24:36] the cataracts sister shut your eyelids
[24:38] for a moment that's it the cataracts are
[24:41] shrinking in a few moments you should be
[24:43] able to see don't say anything about it
[24:45] or I'll be recognised I don't want
[24:47] people to know I'm here now slowly open
[24:50] your eyes Jesus has given you your sight
[24:53] back her eyelids fluttered open she
[24:55] looked up in gasp is them lights yes can
[25:00] you count him there's four then people
[25:03] going by before bill can answer she
[25:05] screamed at the top of her voice faces
[25:08] turned her way she screamed again praise
[25:10] God I can see I can see I was blind and
[25:13] now I see people began moving towards
[25:16] bill and the girl just then the group of
[25:18] Usher's came around a corner of the
[25:19] building spotted bill and rushed to his
[25:21] rescue
[25:21] before the ushers hustled him away a man
[25:24] with a twisted leg who was leaning on a
[25:25] club cried out I know your brother
[25:27] branham have mercy on me sir I've been
[25:30] standing here for eight days I've got
[25:32] five children at home and I'm crippled I
[25:34] believe you're a good boy if you ask God
[25:37] for me he'll do it bill said in the name
[25:40] of Jesus Christ
[25:42] give me your club without hesitation the
[25:45] crippled man handed bill his homemade
[25:46] cane instantly his twisted leg
[25:48] straightened and supported him slapping
[25:51] his shoe on the asphalt the man shouted
[25:52] I'm healed I'm healed
[25:55] excitedly the crowd pressed forward the
[25:58] four Usher's shielding build the best
[25:59] they could force their way back to the
[26:01] auditorium while the people that were
[26:03] near strained just the touch Bill's
[26:05] clothes as he passed it did not matter
[26:07] them that his suit was patched and
[26:09] mended there is a footnote here that the
[26:12] author put at the very end of this
[26:13] chapter I'd like to share it with you
[26:15] years later bill met this woman again
[26:18] she was working as a waitress and told
[26:20] him she had never had any more trouble
[26:22] with her eyes since the day of her
[26:23] healing in 1946 in Jonesboro Arkansas

[43:55] having the father Lord Jesus we come
[43:57] before you this evening father thankful
[43:59] Lord for permitting us to be here in
[44:01] children's church Lord we ask father God
[44:04] that you just let us express a little
[44:07] bit about your word to the children
[44:08] father God we're gonna be talking a
[44:11] little bit about the ministry of our
[44:13] Lord Jesus Christ and some of the things
[44:15] that he did father while he was here on
[44:17] earth and we're so grateful for that
[44:19] Lord we just ask that you bless it
[44:20] father and that you reveal it to us
[44:22] father God and it may be a blessing for
[44:24] the children and all that are here
[44:27] tonight father God we thank you Father
[44:28] because you are so good and loving and
[44:31] kind to his father God and we just want
[44:34] to tell you that we love you Father and
[44:35] that we appreciate you Lord and we just
[44:37] surrender our hearts to you this evening
[44:39] father God we thank you Lord and we ask
[44:41] you for the blessing of this word in the
[44:44] name of the Lord Jesus Christ amen amen
[44:47] you may be seated for now god bless you
[44:49] we're gonna get started and one of the
[44:54] as you know one of the things we want to
[44:56] do is we want to illustrate the things
[44:58] that our Lord Jesus Christ did he you
[45:01] know did while he was here on earth to
[45:05] learn from it right to see how all of us
[45:09] as children of the Lord can learn from
[45:10] it and the last time we were here two
[45:13] weeks ago we learned about the Good
[45:14] Samaritan amen and we saw how on his way
[45:18] to Jericho he had gotten you know he had
[45:20] gotten beat up on the way to Jericho
[45:22] right young men you remember that right
[45:24] and how he thought that when he saw a
[45:27] priest from his people that he was going
[45:31] to get help and the guy just crossed the
[45:33] street and went the other way and then
[45:35] we saw the Levite and the same thing he
[45:38] crossed the street and went the other
[45:39] way and left him
[45:40] there and when he saw the Samaritan you
[45:44] know it wasn't back then it wasn't a
[45:48] custom meaning that Samaritans and Jews
[45:50] did not really have a lot of fellowship
[45:53] together they weren't friends or things
[45:55] of that nature and the last person that
[45:59] he thought was going to help him is the
[46:00] person that helped them and we learned a
[46:03] lesson about that right that we should
[46:04] always love our neighbor as ourselves
[46:11] right because that is what Jesus was
[46:15] telling when he told the parable of the
[46:18] Good Samaritan he said you know go go
[46:22] and do this and you will have eternal
[46:28] life amen so today we want to talk a
[46:31] little bit about Jesus and the children
[46:35] right so how many children here knows
[46:38] that Jesus loves the little children do
[46:41] you know that let me see your hands nice
[46:43] nice and high does Jesus love the little
[46:45] children amen so what we're gonna do is
[46:48] we're gonna we're gonna find out because
[46:49] we're gonna ask Jesus right we're gonna
[46:52] ask Jesus to come here and and and show
[46:55] us a little bit about him right and
[46:57] about the story in the Bible which is
[46:59] found in Matthew 19 which talks about
[47:02] that right so as the story goes Jesus
[47:05] Jesus was on the road Jesus was always
[47:09] on the road right he was going from town
[47:11] to town in those days bringing the Word
[47:14] of God doing different things right and
[47:16] we know that they were always
[47:17] challenging him right and while he was
[47:21] answering the questions that were always
[47:24] being asked of him he was also teaching
[47:27] the disciples right so one day Jesus was
[47:30] coming in into town with the disciples
[47:34] right
[47:36] [Music]
[47:40] make where the scientists we make with
[47:43] Messiah going messiahs comes weights you
[47:49] know you know the disciples were a
[47:51] little bit of rough around the edges
[47:52] some of them right some of them were
[47:54] fishermen and you know workers and so
[48:01] what I'm gonna ask what I'm gonna ask is
[48:03] if Jesus would come back here hey Jesus
[48:06] how you doing god bless you so his
[48:09] disciples look pretty mean especially
[48:10] this one in the blue right
[48:12] pretty mean I think that's Peter they're
[48:14] right Peter Peter was pretty rough amen
[48:18] so what I'm gonna ask is if the is there
[48:20] is there some parents that want to help
[48:22] us so we can illustrate just how Jesus
[48:24] loved the children okay let's see
[48:29] children then do me a favor come here
[48:31] children I'm gonna ask my boys from
[48:33] Sunday school to come help me out come
[48:34] here guys come here don't be shy come
[48:36] here just release you come up okay
[48:41] perfect coming up meow so the children
[48:44] so the children saw Jesus right the
[48:47] children saw Jesus and they wanted to go
[48:49] to him but what happened
[49:09] what did Jesus do Peter knock up excuse
[49:15] me that the little kids come to me for
[49:19] this is how the kingdom of God is let me
[49:23] tell you unless you can come to me like
[49:25] these little children you won't even see
[49:28] the kingdom of God come on come over
[49:30] here bring them so I could touch them
[49:33] and bless them
[49:37] it'll get Ian see I don't know guys I
[49:44] need you guys to understand unless you
[49:47] can come like a little kid you can't
[49:49] even see you can't even understand the
[49:53] kingdom of God because in these little
[49:54] kids there's want to come with me too
[49:58] ah look with this balloon and everything
[50:01] he has 100% faith in his daddy his daddy
[50:06] could just throw him up and he knows
[50:07] that his daddy will catch him he's not
[50:12] scared we have to come to God that way
[50:15] you have to trust God just like these
[50:17] little children with no guile in you no
[50:20] wickedness no evilness being able to
[50:22] forgive these little kids fight 2
[50:25] seconds later they're best friends but
[50:27] all these adults start fighting spend
[50:31] years not talking to each other but
[50:33] nothing will enter in but perfect love
[50:37] Wow see Jesus Jesus was so amazing that
[50:40] he was not only teaching the disciples
[50:42] but he was also teaching the children so
[50:45] children Jesus wants you to come to him
[50:48] he wants you to read about him in his
[50:49] word he wants you to pray to him he
[50:51] wants you to talk to him like your best
[50:53] friend and he's gonna watch out for you
[50:55] and take care of you so when we're young
[50:59] when we're young like these kids and
[51:00] these children we need to seek Jesus and
[51:03] remember as as we start to grow we have
[51:06] to understand that we have to be like
[51:08] children right yeah it's just like he
[51:10] said right so wow that's amazing
[51:14] right did everybody know that you know
[51:17] that we have to be like these little
[51:19] children it's very simple
[51:22] so sometimes let me ask let me ask you
[51:27] guys a question do you believe that
[51:28] Jesus can do anything yes
[51:31] see they don't even think twice about it
[51:34] but sometimes as adults they ask us that
[51:38] question and we start thinking about our
[51:40] problems and we're like I don't know if
[51:43] he can do it he can do everything
[51:46] because what is impossible for man Peter
[51:50] is where Jesus works every day and he
[51:55] makes things come to pass amen okay
[51:58] children you can be seated thank you
[52:00] sister thank you very much
[52:01] Amen let's give them an applause so
[52:07] we're just gonna we're gonna ask Jesus
[52:09] to come back here I gotta talk to these
[52:12] guys about and take a seat and come and
[52:14] come and talk to the disciples your
[52:17] beautiful kids but that's why when the
[52:19] that's why when the babies are babies we
[52:21] also bring them in to be presented in
[52:25] the house of the Lord did you know that
[52:26] we present them to Jesus right because
[52:30] Jesus doesn't want us to keep the
[52:31] children away from him he wants us to
[52:33] bring them he wants us to bring them to
[52:36] children's church like all you parents
[52:37] brought your children to children's
[52:39] church so they can learn about the
[52:41] goodness of God now as we start getting
[52:44] older did you know that Jesus begins to
[52:47] give us a choice did you guys know that
[52:49] see when we're young what are we
[52:52] supposed to do we're supposed to learn
[52:54] about God like all of you and we're also
[52:57] supposed to follow what what do we
[52:59] follow when we're young can somebody
[53:00] tell me one of my Sunday school students
[53:02] what what is something that Moses
[53:05] brought that we're supposed to follow
[53:07] when we're young yes sir that 10
[53:10] commandments let's give them an applause
[53:17] we're supposed to follow the
[53:20] commandments amen see and surely so
[53:24] surely after Jesus taught the disciples
[53:26] can go through the door brother
[53:28] shortly after Jesus taught the disciples
[53:33] about the little children there was also
[53:36] another young man a rich young dignitary
[53:41] okay and we're gonna learn a little bit
[53:45] about the choice that he was faced with
[53:47] but and then we're gonna talk a little
[53:49] bit about the choice that all of you
[53:51] have we're gonna have one day so let's
[53:55] let's let's watch that unfold a little
[53:58] bit right good master master what must I
[54:13] do to inherit eternal life why do you
[54:18] call me good
[54:19] there's nobody good but God but
[54:24] concerning eternal life well we've all
[54:28] heard of the commandments have you kept
[54:30] the commandments you just keep the
[54:32] commandments yes you do not murder you
[54:35] know do not steal do not commit adultery
[54:39] don't lie about your brother
[54:41] I don't have any gods before you honor
[54:44] your father and your mother you know and
[54:47] love your neighbor as yourself
[54:54] yes what then do I lack what else do I
[54:57] need
[54:57] well you've done all this but there's
[55:00] one more thing all your beautiful
[55:03] possessions you sell all that you have
[55:07] and give it to the poor and you'll have
[55:09] eternal life and then come follow me
[55:18] you can put it on offer up so easy now
[55:23] did I tell you guys the truth it's very
[55:32] hard for a rich man to be saved in fact
[55:35] it's easier for a rich man for a camel
[55:39] to go through the eye of a needle than
[55:43] for a rich man to be saved how anybody
[55:50] be saved that's a good question
[55:52] but you know what what is impossible for
[55:54] man with God all things are possible I
[56:13] tell you the truth anybody that would
[56:17] forsake their homes their riches their
[56:21] children their mothers their fathers
[56:22] their land their dreams you would
[56:26] forsake all of that take the word apply
[56:29] it to your life and follow me then those
[56:35] will be with me and have treasures in
[56:38] heaven but Jesus what about all his good
[56:43] works that he did he fed the poor he
[56:46] helped the widow he did all these good
[56:48] things is any of that gonna help him
[56:50] it's good to be a good person it's good
[56:54] to have all those works but those good
[56:55] works those good works for the mic don't
[56:57] ever save us they'll never save us and
[57:01] we're gonna be tempted in all things now
[57:04] let me just tell you something the Bible
[57:05] says that Jesus was tempted in all
[57:07] things everything so he could relate I
[57:11] could relate to you right now I just got
[57:14] a thought man this young man could he
[57:17] could fund my ministry I could have had
[57:21] chariots and all kinds of stuff with his
[57:24] riches he was right there he wanted to
[57:28] follow and serve me but he couldn't give
[57:30] that stuff up
[57:31] I could have had a great big ship and
[57:33] horses and my own temple to preach from
[57:36] but now that was a temptation brother
[57:39] Mike because it's easy if somebody is
[57:43] willing to give you the money to take it
[57:44] but sometimes that's not always God's
[57:48] Way so I tell you it doesn't matter the
[57:53] works that you do what matters is if you
[57:55] can apply this word to your heart and
[57:58] live it 100% see the Apostle Paul taught
[58:06] us that we are saved we have to accept
[58:16] the sacrifice who is Jesus Christ so one
[58:21] of the things that we're gonna face
[58:22] children is that one day you're gonna
[58:25] have the choice to accept Jesus as your
[58:29] Savior like this rich young ruler did
[58:34] see some of us may not be rich with
[58:37] possessions
[58:38] maybe we're rich with other things with
[58:42] things that we love that we put before
[58:44] God maybe we like to watch TV maybe we
[58:48] like to play maybe we like to do all of
[58:50] these things and we don't make time for
[58:52] God but one day we're gonna have to make
[58:56] a choice and make our priorities
[59:00] different and all a priority means
[59:03] children is what we purse what we excuse
[59:06] me what we put first in our lives and
[59:10] remember the commandments say that thou
[59:13] shalt not have any other gods before me
[59:16] and when we worship things on this earth
[59:20] whether it be basketball players video
[59:22] games being with our friends texting
[59:26] with our friends or whatever it is that
[59:28] we're doing and we put that before God
[59:32] we're not following him we're doing
[59:34] exactly what the rich young ruler did
[59:38] and all Jesus wanted him to do
[59:43] was to follow him and he would have had
[59:46] ten times ten times those rewards in
[59:51] heaven plus eternal life so it's
[59:54] something that we're gonna have to
[59:55] consider the Gospels Matthew Mark Luke
[1:00:00] and John all tell the story we need to
[1:00:05] read it and understand it because that
[1:00:06] question there's a lot of us that are
[1:00:09] already facing that question today some
[1:00:10] of my younger some of my older children
[1:00:13] right from children's church will we
[1:00:16] follow Christ or we or will we do what
[1:00:21] we want kind of like that rich young
[1:00:23] ruler and it's really and its really
[1:00:28] disciples really it's it's it's really a
[1:00:31] question we all face as adults right so
[1:00:35] to follow Jesus so Jesus let me just ask
[1:00:38] one more question so you saying that I
[1:00:41] have to be poor on earth is that what
[1:00:46] you're saying you don't have to be poor
[1:00:50] to enter into the kingdom of heaven but
[1:00:54] you have to cherish more than anything
[1:00:56] the riches that are in that word of God
[1:01:04] Jesus I'm the lawyer in the group
[1:01:10] how do we stay humble when we gain more
[1:01:14] wealth how do we maintain our humility
[1:01:18] or her humbleness well we have to
[1:01:20] understand that every good gift comes
[1:01:22] from the father so anything that you
[1:01:25] have
[1:01:25] how can you boast about something that
[1:01:28] didn't come from you in the beginning so
[1:01:31] the more you get the humbler you should
[1:01:34] be knowing that every good thing comes
[1:01:36] from God and the humble ooh you are the
[1:01:40] more he wants to give you because he
[1:01:42] knows that the Jesus so if I'm a so if
[1:01:49] I'm a child and my parents buy me things
[1:01:55] does that mean I shouldn't make fun of
[1:01:58] people and tell them that I have more
[1:01:59] than them and that my and that my stuff
[1:02:01] is better than them
[1:02:10] you wouldn't brag about what you have
[1:02:13] cuz you know mom and daddy don't have to
[1:02:15] get you anything they buy you things
[1:02:17] because they love you I think all of us
[1:02:22] as parents we want to buy our kids
[1:02:24] everything that we didn't have right but
[1:02:27] in turn as children what should we do
[1:02:30] Jesus thankful should we pray for our
[1:02:33] parents absolutely a family that prays
[1:02:37] together stays together
[1:02:39] so pray for your parents but also pray
[1:02:41] with your parents that would be awesome
[1:02:44] and don't forget to always be grateful
[1:02:45] for what you have be grateful be
[1:02:48] grateful be grateful be grateful give
[1:02:51] thanks with a grateful heart Jesus if I
[1:02:53] if if if me and my little brothers and
[1:02:57] my little sisters if we follow you and
[1:03:00] we fall and we make a mistake will you
[1:03:03] wait for us and help us absolutely you
[1:03:07] know the difference between a sinner and
[1:03:09] a saint is that the sinner will fall and
[1:03:13] he'll stay down there I might as well
[1:03:16] just stay here I'm good for nothing I
[1:03:18] mess up anyways but the same the
[1:03:21] righteous man falls seven times but he
[1:03:23] gets up eight times so it doesn't matter
[1:03:26] how you start the race doesn't matter
[1:03:29] the middle of the race what matters is
[1:03:30] how you finish the race I'll always be
[1:03:36] there I never promised that the road
[1:03:40] will be easy but I promise that I'll be
[1:03:42] there wow that's that's pretty awesome
[1:03:46] right does anybody I'm gonna ask the
[1:03:48] children do you have any questions for
[1:03:49] Jesus about what you've learned today
[1:03:53] no we're all we all so let's go back and
[1:04:00] review so one of the things that we
[1:04:02] learned is that Jesus loves the children
[1:04:04] is that right and he wants to bless them
[1:04:07] is that right so so how would parents
[1:04:11] today present their kids to Jesus like
[1:04:15] they did back then I know what we need
[1:04:20] to do is we need to pray with our
[1:04:22] children right
[1:04:23] right Jesus as parents it says wherever
[1:04:28] two or three are gathered in my name I
[1:04:30] will be there right so if we if we sit
[1:04:34] down with our kids and pray you'll come
[1:04:38] and you'll blessa absolutely so we've
[1:04:41] we've learned that right it's very
[1:04:43] simple right it's almost too simple
[1:04:45] Jesus right but Jesus blesses the
[1:04:48] children and we are all his children
[1:04:50] because that's what we learned today
[1:04:52] it's so simple that it'll dumbfound the
[1:04:55] wise and the prudent but my little
[1:04:58] children will understand it and you guys
[1:05:00] will grab it
[1:05:01] so we also learned that we have a choice
[1:05:05] to make that if we follow the
[1:05:08] commandments as young people and then we
[1:05:11] become accountable or responsible and we
[1:05:17] grow up and now we know the difference
[1:05:19] between right and wrong Jesus is
[1:05:22] offering us to come follow him in and
[1:05:26] have eternal life and forgive us of all
[1:05:28] of the mistakes that we've made amen
[1:05:31] right so we're gonna have to think about
[1:05:35] that and talk about it with your parents
[1:05:36] say mom dad you know I've been thinking
[1:05:39] about it how is it that I must follow
[1:05:42] Jesus because Jesus clearly gave your
[1:05:47] parents and get salvation is for you
[1:05:52] yeah there's a way to do it there's no
[1:05:56] reason there's no reason there's no
[1:05:59] reason that we should be concerned we
[1:06:04] need to believe like little children
[1:06:06] right and remember last time we were
[1:06:09] here we learned about the Good Samaritan
[1:06:11] Jesus told us about the Good Samaritan
[1:06:13] and we have to love each other right we
[1:06:19] have to love each other and what hurts
[1:06:21] me should hurt Jesus should hurt my
[1:06:26] brother disciples and what hurts you
[1:06:28] should hurt me we should care about each
[1:06:31] other and pray about each other you know
[1:06:36] I was I was learning about your prophet
[1:06:38] the other day Jesus brother branham and
[1:06:41] I can't remember because I was I was
[1:06:44] looking for something specific but I
[1:06:46] came across something that he said and
[1:06:48] one of the things that he said he said
[1:06:52] we should never say anything bad about
[1:06:54] anybody
[1:06:56] he said we should look for what's good
[1:06:59] and encourage them with that the Bible
[1:07:04] tells us that Wow
[1:07:05] if you even call your brother a fool
[1:07:07] you're in danger of hell's fire so I
[1:07:13] want to love you know Jesus when I first
[1:07:15] came to - to - to the camp in Sacramento
[1:07:21] that our pastor invited us for the
[1:07:23] greatest thing that I was attracted to
[1:07:26] as a child was the love that the people
[1:07:29] showed for one another which was the
[1:07:32] love that you are teaching us how to do
[1:07:35] right it's what I told my disciples the
[1:07:37] people will know who you are by your
[1:07:40] love for one another not by the car you
[1:07:42] drive or the church you go to or how
[1:07:45] hard you pray or your gift of healing or
[1:07:48] discernment your love for one another so
[1:07:52] I've been me I've been meaning to ask
[1:07:53] you something because somebody said
[1:07:56] about the impossible is the impossible
[1:07:58] really possible with you with God all
[1:08:02] things are possible for the mic I mean
[1:08:04] come on you're saved you're proof that
[1:08:06] all things are impossible oh that's
[1:08:07] right I was very sick last year you guys
[1:08:10] remember in April I got very sick and he
[1:08:13] was with me brother and man you talked
[1:08:15] about this morning
[1:08:17] and his testimony a lot of us have
[1:08:19] testimonies about that right and
[1:08:23] anything so what how would you encourage
[1:08:26] the children to - to go after their
[1:08:31] dream in the right order Jesus so the
[1:08:34] first thing I would encourage you guys
[1:08:35] so you can achieve your dreams I
[1:08:38] encourage you to give me your dreams to
[1:08:43] give me your heart and I'll put it
[1:08:46] inside you a new heart with new desires
[1:08:49] and I'll bring those to pass see
[1:08:54] sometimes we have our own dreams or our
[1:08:55] own desires and we think oh I'm gonna be
[1:08:57] a Christian or now that I'm a Christian
[1:08:59] I'm serving you God now you got to give
[1:09:01] me this car or now you gotta give me
[1:09:03] this house I'm serving you Lord now can
[1:09:05] you give me this Xbox that I really
[1:09:07] really wanted cuz I prayed for it see
[1:09:09] those are still your desires see your
[1:09:13] thoughts are not my thoughts so if you
[1:09:15] want success in your life give me your
[1:09:18] heart I'll trade you I'll give you a
[1:09:20] brand new heart and put my desires in
[1:09:25] your heart so that when you wake up in
[1:09:28] the morning you have new desires that
[1:09:32] I'll be more happy than to give you fill
[1:09:36] you with love I'll fill you with peace
[1:09:38] I'll fill you with joy and in the midst
[1:09:44] of the storm you can say he is my dream
[1:09:48] he is my peace wow that's awesome
[1:09:54] man you know as we learn more and more
[1:09:57] about Jesus I think over the next couple
[1:09:59] of weeks it's really beginning to paint
[1:10:02] a picture of what we all have man it's
[1:10:07] truly is awesome we are truly blessed
[1:10:09] right and I just want to thank the Lord
[1:10:13] amen do you are you thankful to the Lord
[1:10:16] and and if we can stay humble the word
[1:10:20] tells us he who hums little humbles
[1:10:22] himself God will exalt him so don't brag
[1:10:27] don't push everybody around so I'm the
[1:10:29] best if you could stay humble and give
[1:10:31] God all the glory
[1:10:32] don't worry I'll see you that our Father
[1:10:35] in heaven will see you and he'll exalt
[1:10:37] you but he who exalts himself will be
[1:10:41] humbled like the rich man he just came
[1:10:46] with all his his camels and his chariots
[1:10:49] and his gold and even my disciples were
[1:10:51] like wow I know they let him in pretty
[1:10:54] fast he did and anyone let the children
[1:10:56] stop the little guys in but when they
[1:10:58] saw this guy was rolling in dough they
[1:11:00] thought he must be important but
[1:11:03] he sure walked away humble didn't he
[1:11:08] but if we humble ourselves and stay low
[1:11:10] God will lift us up wow that's awesome
[1:11:14] that's that truly is awesome Jesus
[1:11:18] Oh Paul how can you explain to I mean
[1:11:20] Peter what the rich young ruler rejected
[1:11:23] oh wow you can't even imagine I think my
[1:11:31] borrower prophet brother Branham says
[1:11:33] that his wife when she went beyond the
[1:11:36] curtain of time she was there in heaven
[1:11:38] and she said Billy you preached about it
[1:11:42] but you have no idea what it's like over
[1:11:46] there you can't even imagine what it is
[1:11:52] like over there in heaven but I will
[1:11:54] tell you this you keep on reading later
[1:11:57] on it tells you where he ended up talks
[1:12:01] about the rich man in torment I want to
[1:12:06] share that for the mic yeah it does it
[1:12:09] definitely does it talks about Lazarus
[1:12:11] and the Richmond and it says that there
[1:12:15] was a great space between them right and
[1:12:19] that the rich man asked father Abraham
[1:12:23] to let Lazarus dip his finger in water
[1:12:25] and put it on his tongue because the
[1:12:28] place where he was that was so hot but
[1:12:32] he was this close to me I touched him I
[1:12:35] talked to him and he turned away and
[1:12:37] when he couldn't do it he begged to let
[1:12:42] him go tell his family about where he
[1:12:45] was and it was not good it was
[1:12:51] impossible but Jesus did you still love
[1:12:56] him absolutely absolutely I loved him
[1:13:00] that's why it scares me a lot of the
[1:13:03] time where people say God is a loving
[1:13:04] God or what can separate us from the
[1:13:06] love of God nothing can separate you
[1:13:09] from the love of God even in hell
[1:13:11] God loves you but it's our choice
[1:13:16] that separates us our choice so we're
[1:13:21] all gonna make the right choice right
[1:13:22] yes a man I know I want to make the
[1:13:27] right choice I want to follow Jesus I
[1:13:29] want to be like Jesus amen amen
[1:13:32] how many of my young how many of my kids
[1:13:34] here want to be like Jesus raise your
[1:13:36] hand up to amen
[1:13:39] Bateman brother Ernie amen that's right
[1:13:43] you know you know well Jesus is the best
[1:13:48] there's no other hero like him they come
[1:13:52] close and I'm talking about Jesus's men
[1:13:55] on earth but Jesus is by far the top
[1:14:00] anything else disciples that you'd like
[1:14:02] to act ask Jesus about what we've
[1:14:04] learned children any other little
[1:14:06] children want to ask him anything what
[1:14:10] do you think you do you think it was it
[1:14:12] was it was he gave he gave he gave the
[1:14:16] rich young ruler a chance right he asked
[1:14:18] him exactly and Jesus was very honest
[1:14:20] with them right he told them what he had
[1:14:23] to do he told him come follow me see
[1:14:30] Jesus doesn't walk Jesus you don't push
[1:14:32] people right push Jesus see Jesus
[1:14:35] doesn't push us we're supposed to follow
[1:14:38] him where he goes I go what he does I do
[1:14:44] do you ever think Jesus would talk bad
[1:14:46] about somebody or make fun of somebody
[1:14:49] or hurt somebody's feelings no right
[1:14:57] there's a there was a saying that if you
[1:15:00] keep your mouth closed no flies will go
[1:15:03] in there which means don't say anything
[1:15:06] bad about anybody if you don't have
[1:15:09] anything good to say don't say anything
[1:15:10] bad even a comment we don't know what
[1:15:15] the person is going through we don't
[1:15:19] know what's happening in their lives if
[1:15:20] we can't be positive and full of love no
[1:15:25] comment
[1:15:28] all I want my brother's to know is like
[1:15:31] Jesus I love you unconditionally do we
[1:15:35] love each other unconditionally no
[1:15:36] matter what we got to get there amen
[1:15:40] amen
[1:15:43] unconditional love Jesus loved us all
[1:15:45] right amen amen but why don't we stand
