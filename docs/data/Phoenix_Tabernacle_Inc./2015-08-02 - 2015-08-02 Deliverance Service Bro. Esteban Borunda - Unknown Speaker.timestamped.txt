[31:40] simple just as you

[31:47] sir God bless
[31:49] you could you please
[31:55] stand for the reading the
[31:58] word be in Isaiah chapter
[32:12] 1 verse two
[32:26] vers
[32:29] hear o heavens and give ear o Earth for
[32:32] the Lord has spoken I have nourished and
[32:34] brought up children and they have
[32:36] rebelled against
[32:45] me the ox knows its owner and they ask
[32:48] its Master's crib but Israel does not
[32:51] know my people do not
[32:56] consider
[33:02] oh sinful Nation a people lading with an
[33:05] equity a seed of evildoers children that
[33:08] are corruptors they have forsaken the
[33:10] Lord they have provoked the Holy One of
[33:13] Israel to anger they are gone away
[33:25] backward
[33:29] why should you be stricken
[33:33] anymore why should you be stricken
[33:38] anymore
[33:40] why you will Revolt more and more the
[33:44] whole head is sick and the whole heart
[33:53] faint
[33:54] 16 wash you make you clean put away the
[33:59] evil of your doings from before my eyes
[34:02] cease to do
[34:10] evil learn to do well seek judgment
[34:14] relieve the oppressed judge the
[34:17] fatherless plead for the
[34:25] widows
[34:33] come now and let us
[34:36] reason together says the
[34:41] Lord though your sins be as Scarlet they
[34:44] shall be white as snow though they shall
[34:46] be red like Crimson they shall be as
[34:55] wool
[35:02] Heavenly Father Lord I come before
[35:05] you Lord I Surrender myself to you
[35:09] lord lord may you have control of the
[35:11] service
[35:12] Lord may you move and seek everybody's
[35:18] hearts Lord we ask it in the name of the
[35:21] Lord Jesus
[35:25] Christ come now
[35:29] let us reason
[35:32] it the word says come
[35:35] now the reason I chose that is because
[35:37] it shows
[35:41] urgency when someone says come
[35:45] now it's because there is an
[35:48] emergency there's a sense of
[35:52] urgency because there is a message you
[35:54] need to
[35:55] hear
[35:57] because I see your
[35:59] condition because Israel is my first
[36:03] love but you're you're doing
[36:07] Abomination you're offering
[36:10] sacrifices your sacrifices mean nothing
[36:13] to
[36:14] me you're wrong from the head to the
[36:18] foot you're
[36:20] sick and it's come to the to to the
[36:24] sanctuaries your sacrifices mean nothing
[36:26] to
[36:29] stop come now let us reason there is an
[36:35] urgency to
[36:38] reason you know it's it's like when a
[36:40] man is doing
[36:42] wrong let's say ston is driving down the
[36:47] street and I break the
[36:49] law and the policeman is right behind
[36:53] me instead of stopping
[36:57] and talking to the police
[36:59] officer and reasoning with
[37:02] him our choices is that we run from the
[37:05] police
[37:06] officer not that you may run but we may
[37:11] run I would like to say today the holy
[37:15] spirit is like the policeman
[37:19] today he sees you doing
[37:21] wrong the light goes off or the siren
[37:25] will go off and you know what that siren
[37:29] means you quickly look look around it
[37:34] means it's the police he's an upholder
[37:36] of the
[37:37] law now God who written the law with the
[37:42] very finger of his
[37:45] hand you follow
[37:47] me now the police
[37:50] officer if you run from
[37:52] him you continue to
[37:55] run charges will
[37:58] amount if you fail to
[38:00] stop you will get a felony
[38:04] flight and then if you argue with
[38:07] him and if he tries to give you a
[38:10] ticket then you add another
[38:14] felony then if he's had it with
[38:17] you and he says step out the
[38:20] car and you're trying to challenge him
[38:24] he will take you down that's another
[38:26] choice
[38:27] another felony that's a felony after
[38:32] felony that's how Israel was
[38:35] doing they were out of their
[38:37] mind yet God has sent a
[38:40] prophet and this Prophet is is a Grace
[38:44] Prophet brother said this man was a
[38:47] Grace
[38:49] Prophet Israel and said come let us
[38:55] reason come
[38:57] now not
[39:01] tomorrow I've I've talking to a few
[39:04] people he said one
[39:07] time I'll let the cat out of the bag
[39:09] then my brother came to me and I said
[39:14] ah ston I want to be just like you when
[39:19] I get a job I'm going go to church so I
[39:20] could pay
[39:23] tithing and I'll give my life to the
[39:25] Lord step
[39:27] back I said sorry I said but you don't
[39:31] want to be like
[39:33] me and I don't want you to be like me I
[39:36] want you to be like
[39:37] Jesus don't wait until you get a
[39:40] job because we know you can't
[39:45] work the reason why because you haven't
[39:48] come to
[39:49] reason you haven't come to your
[39:52] senses don't lie to
[39:54] yourself Come As You Are
[40:01] a man running from the
[40:04] police or a woman or a
[40:08] family or mama or
[40:11] dad
[40:15] now to
[40:19] reason explain your
[40:23] action why did you do what you did
[40:27] come now let us
[40:33] reason what was your cause or
[40:38] motive what motivated you to do
[40:41] that come now let us
[40:47] reason the ability to
[40:50] think people have lost their
[40:53] minds and they're still losing their
[40:55] minds
[40:57] and you will never get into the right
[41:01] mind until you come to
[41:04] reason not
[41:06] with but with the
[41:08] Lord come
[41:10] now

[41:23] with you come now and let us reason

[44:04] wanted them to do and all they could
[44:08] do daddy mommy daddy and there is no
[44:13] mama there was no Daddy there was no God
[44:16] there there was nobody Pinocchio
[44:21] escaped I know it sounds
[44:23] blasphemy but it fits perfect L because

[44:30] reason it's an urgency
[44:33] come us you and I you and God reason it
[44:39] out let's get it over with and done with
[44:42] only one who could come and release you
[44:45] from his
[44:47] bounds almighty God because you choose
[44:51] to
[44:52] do you can't do it on your own because
[44:55] then if you still do it on your
[44:57] own turn another
[45:00] page tomorrow it's the same thing now

[47:39] about David right now David all right
[47:42] David David God God loved
[47:47] David of his own
[47:51] ey how could David be the apple of his
[47:54] own eye
[47:57] David confesses in Isaiah chapter
[48:00] 40 not only did God bring him out from
[48:02] the myy
[48:04] clay set his feet upon a
[48:08] rock but later on down he
[48:11] says evil has encompassed
[48:15] me and has taken hold of
[48:19] me and my iniquities outnumber the hairs
[48:22] of my
[48:24] head so much that I can't even lift my
[48:29] head up
[48:30] high I can't even lift my head up
[48:35] high but I'm needing you
[48:39] Lord Del me from this sinful
[48:45] flesh how could it
[48:47] be isn't that
[48:50] awesome how how much
[48:54] grace
[48:56] am come now let us reason
[49:08] together the holy spirit is the
[49:10] policeman
[49:12] today the lights been
[49:15] flashing Sirens been
[49:18] going and school is going to
[49:22] start and I'm expressing myself
[49:27] because you are going to face a legion
[49:29] of
[49:31] demons and a legion of demons are
[49:33] waiting for
[49:35] you each person is a
[49:38] spirit and then each person is governed
[49:41] by a
[49:43] spirit or Spirits so there is a legion
[49:47] waiting for
[49:49] you and
[49:51] watching
[49:53] seeking to devour you
[49:56] but he will not because in the
[50:00] scripture Satan is walking about like
[50:04] a seeking whom he may devour brother
[50:09] Alex used this in many
[50:15] sermons I said it's in the
[50:18] word whom he may and I stopped right
[50:23] there why is it say May
[50:27] because you give him the
[50:30] permission to try to devour
[50:33] you to torment you but it's time now
[50:39] it's time that we start shouting at the
[50:43] Devil not shouting at the Shout at the
[50:45] Devil yeah yeah bend your
[50:48] head I'm saying Shout at the
[50:51] Devil you have no part in
[50:53] me leave me Satan in the name of the
[50:57] Lord Jesus Christ start invoking the
[51:00] name of the Lord Jesus
[51:02] Christ no matter what
[51:05] happens what comes against you if you
[51:08] plant your
[51:09] foot there's going to be a battle he's
[51:12] going to make you try and
[51:14] move as long as you plant your
[51:17] feet you don't back
[51:21] up you'll defeat
[51:23] him in the name of the Lord Jesus
[51:27] according to your faith that you planted
[51:29] your foot on a rock and if you haven't
[51:33] done that today if you haven't come to
[51:36] reason with
[51:37] God lord Jesus I Need You Lord I'm
[51:42] unlean Lord there's nothing good in
[51:45] me but there is one that is good and
[51:48] that is you I need you I need your power
[51:52] in me give me the new birth
[51:57] you know what you don't you're still
[51:58] going to have troubles when you have a
[52:00] new
[52:01] birth because Satan's always
[52:03] there to try you see if it's not some
[52:08] jail house
[52:11] religion the reason I said that is
[52:14] because I've had two or three
[52:18] instances that
[52:19] old
[52:22] homies one that got out of prison
[52:26] and he came to my
[52:27] house and he said hey
[52:30] also hey man what's up and I said oh I'm
[52:32] not
[52:34] also I'm Stan and he goes oh yeah I
[52:37] heard man he just wanted to see if I
[52:39] would respond to that
[52:42] name man what's up man you know what's
[52:44] up whatever but I told him I'm a now I
[52:49] says I'm with the Lord now he goes yeah
[52:52] I
[52:53] heard he said and I told him this ain't
[52:55] no jail house
[52:57] religion said before you say it and he
[53:00] said well what is it man I said it's the
[53:03] Holy
[53:03] Ghost fell backwards I said it's the
[53:07] Holy
[53:08] Ghost that's what I'm talking about
[53:11] that's what we need today I ran into
[53:13] another one he used to be a really
[53:16] really good Chum close
[53:19] guy saw me with my backpack at
[53:24] school had a beard he said oh and I I
[53:28] stopped and I was
[53:30] cringed and I turned around I said oh
[53:33] what's up Miguel I called him by his
[53:36] name you can't hide in that
[53:40] beard I tried I said the way you
[53:44] walk I said well there's I have a
[53:46] different
[53:48] walk but but the Lord touched me right
[53:51] here I used to walk like I was cool
[53:56] or I used to walk
[53:58] like you're my next
[54:01] victim but God got a hold of me not only
[54:04] did he touch me Satan
[54:08] thought that he was doing his own
[54:11] work but God used him and his agent to
[54:16] slow me down and put me on my
[54:19] back which allowed brother
[54:21] matya brother to come to my
[54:25] bedside I will never forget
[54:28] that through my life that meant the
[54:31] world to
[54:33] me man I was strung
[54:35] out my leg was opened
[54:38] up I just got out of
[54:41] emergency I almost died seven
[54:46] transfusions my hair sticking
[54:48] up all
[54:50] pale and yeah they
[54:53] came brother Paul says don't you know
[54:55] God is calling
[54:58] you I put my head down I said yes I
[55:01] know but I didn't say anything else but
[55:03] you know this and that
[55:07] and right in my right in
[55:09] there they prayed for me I lifted my my
[55:13] arms and I surrendered in that
[55:16] bed it wasn't over
[55:19] then it wasn't over then but s Satan s
[55:25] another Thorn at my
[55:27] side and it stirred me
[55:30] up that anger took
[55:36] over and revenge set
[55:41] in he was saying come
[55:44] now let us
[55:50] reason I would like to for you to
[55:54] hear a word from Brother
[55:57] brandham souls in
[56:01] prison can you please what a difference
[56:04] it was from the vision I had here not
[56:05] long ago of being in glory with the
[56:08] people the contrast but in this as I was
[56:12] falling I finally I I scream for my
[56:16] daddy of course being just a kid that's

[56:33] to God there was no God there there was
[56:38] nothing there and after a while I heard
[56:41] the most
[56:43] mournful sound that I ever
[56:46] heard and it was the office feeling
[56:49] there's no way even a literal burning
[56:52] fire would be a pleasure to the side of
[56:54] what this was now those Visions has
[56:57] never been
[56:59] wrong and it was just one of the most
[57:01] horrible feelings I ever had and what
[57:03] did I heard a noise sound like some kind
[57:06] of a a a haunted Affair and when it was
[57:10] I looked coming and it was
[57:13] women and they had green stuff yes you

[57:19] stuff under their eyes and their eyes
[57:21] look like run back like a the women to
[57:24] he pain their eyes run back like that

[1:00:10] battle I would fight it for
[1:00:13] them I I can't do it for
[1:00:17] them but there is one who has fought
[1:00:20] it who has
[1:00:22] conquered who went to the
