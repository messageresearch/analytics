[16:38] beautiful it's so wonderful to
[16:41] hear praises to the Lord from our
[16:45] children and tonight um as we continue
[16:48] our series of sequential experts from
[16:51] the series of books called Supernatural
[16:53] the life of William brandham this is our
[16:56] second installment in 2017 where still
[16:59] in book two the young man in his
[17:00] desperation 1933 to
[17:04] 1946 this particular chapter we're
[17:07] starting new tonight the title is killer
[17:10] Bull and though a lot of us may know or
[17:13] remember the story this chapter gave me
[17:18] several very pleasant surprises as I
[17:21] read it because it had been some time
[17:22] since I had read it before tonight uh
[17:25] it's a very special privilege to present
[17:28] this work that was done by our brother
[17:29] Owen
[17:30] jurgenson um there are a lot of things
[17:33] happening in the world today political
[17:36] events are swirling around us we
[17:39] see protests and and all kinds of things
[17:42] happening in the geopolitical sense all
[17:44] around the world well the same very same
[17:47] thing was happening at the beginning of
[17:48] this chapter uh this is the
[17:51] largest jump in time we'll take probably
[17:54] for the rest of the series the last
[17:55] chapter was uh was the one on hurricane
[17:59] Mountain lost on Hurricane Mountain in
[18:00] in the snowstorm that was 1941 well
[18:03] tonight we suddenly jumped to
[18:06] 1945 and so one thing I would say about
[18:11] this chapter in a general perspective no
[18:15] matter what's going on around us in the
[18:16] world today and this applies to our
[18:19] children and and and us that are young
[18:22] at heart as well no matter how many
[18:25] things are changing and how the world
[18:27] and circumstances seem to us we need to
[18:30] keep our minds focused on the Lord Jesus
[18:34] Christ because Divine love wins
[18:37] overall and our Lord Jesus Christ
[18:40] imparts that to our
[18:43] hearts our Prophet Willam Mary and
[18:46] brandham received a very special
[18:48] Revelation in this chapter that was one
[18:50] of the present surprises that I
[18:53] encountered when I reread it and so as
[18:55] we'll get started here
[19:07] the devastating war in Europe was
[19:09] grinding to its end and with the German
[19:12] Army being squeezed hard from two sides
[19:14] by Allied Forces in January of 1945 the
[19:19] Russian army led by General
[19:22] zukov pierced to the Odair River just 40
[19:25] Mi east of
[19:27] Berlin soon after after the Russian
[19:29] mechanicz divisions gumed to a halt in a
[19:32] bog of spring mud and stiff German
[19:35] resistance at the same time the Western
[19:38] allies were making good progress through
[19:40] France and Belgium with the Americans
[19:42] having penetrated farthest into German
[19:44] held
[19:45] territory early in March General
[19:48] Patton's thirdd Army reached the Ryan
[19:50] River at
[19:51] cin a few days later General hajes first
[19:54] Army seized a bridge farther Downstream
[19:57] at ragen
[19:59] the American generals longed to keep
[20:01] going so they could beat the Russians to
[20:02] Berlin but they were ordered to wait for
[20:05] General Montgomery's 25 British
[20:07] divisions to catch up by April 25th the
[20:11] Russians had not only encircled Berlin
[20:13] but they had also met up with the
[20:15] American forces on the Elba River 45
[20:18] miles to the West at the same time
[20:20] German defenses in Italy collapsed
[20:23] allowing their Western allies to advance
[20:25] rapidly North up the Italian boot on
[20:28] April 28th the Italian dictator bito
[20:31] musolini was caught and executed by his
[20:34] own people as he tried to flee from the
[20:36] advancing allies fascism now laid dead
[20:40] as a world political force and Nazism
[20:42] was breathing its last communism on the
[20:46] other hand was kicking and stretching
[20:47] and gobbling up everything within reach
[20:50] as Communists and Nazis battled in the
[20:52] streets of Berlin Hitler appointed one
[20:54] of his AIDS Carl donet as head of the
[20:58] German State then on April 30th Adolf
[21:02] Hitler quietly disappeared from the face
[21:04] of the Earth donet immediately began the
[21:07] process of unilateral surrender which
[21:09] was officially completed on May 8th
[21:12] 1945 the war in Europe was
[21:16] over in the face of these momentous
[21:19] world events William brandham could only
[21:21] watch in Marvel for they meant that of
[21:24] the seven visions of the future he had
[21:26] seen in a row on that June morning in
[21:29] 1933 three of them had now happened
[21:32] literally musolini had died in disgrace
[21:35] Hitler had come to a mysterious end and
[21:38] communism was growing stronger as a
[21:40] dominant political force no doubt the
[21:43] other four Visions would follow in God's
[21:45] Own time this gave Bill a reason to be
[21:48] optimistic about his personal future
[21:50] surely the Lord must have a specific
[21:52] purpose for his life or else why would
[21:55] the almighty bestow on him such an
[21:57] unusual gift
[21:59] Bill needed all the fuel he could find
[22:01] to keep the small fire of his optimism
[22:03] burning because in the natural he could
[22:06] see no way that he could ever dig
[22:08] himself out of his poverty far enough to
[22:10] accomplish anything great for the
[22:12] kingdom of God he still worked his three
[22:15] jobs two without pay even though he
[22:18] always seemed short of cash he never
[22:20] considered taking any money for his
[22:23] Services as Pastor he had several
[22:25] reasons for this first from reading his
[22:28] Bible and from watching ministers around
[22:30] him he recognized early in his ministry
[22:33] that the love of money could be one of
[22:35] the deadliest traps a minister would
[22:37] ever face and Bill intended to avoid it
[22:41] secondly although some members of his
[22:43] congregation were making as much as $3
[22:45] an hour most members were as poor as or
[22:48] poorer than he was and Bill could not
[22:51] bring himself to ask these poor people
[22:53] to sacrifice any more than they already
[22:55] were he did preach the biblical
[22:58] principle of tithing and every member
[23:00] put a tenth of their income into a box
[23:02] kept in the back of the church
[23:03] specifically for that purpose but Bill
[23:06] didn't use a penny of this money for
[23:08] himself it all went toward the monthly
[23:11] loan payments just barely enough left
[23:13] over for upkeep on the building his
[23:16] third reason carried a
[23:21] touch of Pride and self-reliance since
[23:25] he was strong and able to work he
[23:26] thought why not work
[23:29] one payday afternoon Bill and Ma
[23:31] budgeted out his weekly $28 paycheck
[23:34] from his job at Public Service Indiana
[23:37] his own tithes came out first then ma
[23:40] pointed out the bills that absolutely
[23:42] had to have a payment no matter how they
[23:45] divided their remaining
[23:47] $25.20 they simply could not make it
[23:49] cover all of their immediate obligations
[23:52] they lacked about $10 bill held up a
[23:55] letter and said honey we can't even
[23:58] start to pay this one but we've got to
[24:01] pay it she said oh Bill what are we
[24:04] going to
[24:05] do Bill had an idea you know what
[24:08] tonight at church I'm going to take up
[24:09] an
[24:10] offering made's initial surprise melted
[24:13] into Amusement I'm going to enjoy
[24:16] watching you
[24:17] try that night after the song service
[24:20] and before he preached Bill said all
[24:23] right friends tonight now I hate to ask
[24:26] you for this made a g him a comical look
[24:29] knowing how uncomfortable he felt Bill
[24:32] tried to keep from looking at her as he
[24:34] stumbled around for words I never did
[24:36] this before it's these hard times you
[24:39] know and can't hardly make ends meet if
[24:43] you all got a nickel or a dime you would
[24:45] like to drop in my hat as it's passed
[24:47] around brother weart would you come and
[24:49] take my hat Deacon weart came forward
[24:52] looking as puzzled as everyone else not
[24:55] because he didn't love his Pastor he did
[24:58] they all did and they were certainly
[25:00] willing to help bill in any way they
[25:02] could they were surprised because in the
[25:04] past 12 years this had never happened
[25:07] before brother weart passed a hat down
[25:10] along the first Pew Bill watched as Mrs
[25:13] Weber reached down in a pocket on her
[25:15] checkered apron and pulled out a little
[25:16] snap top coin purse when she fished out
[25:19] a nickel Bill's heart sank like the lead
[25:23] weight on a fishing line dropping into
[25:24] the muck at the bottom of a pond he knew
[25:28] these were tough times for almost
[25:29] everyone not just him he couldn't do it
[25:33] wait a minute sister Weber you don't
[25:35] need to put that Nickel in there I
[25:37] didn't really mean it I was just teasing
[25:39] you all to see what you would
[25:41] do now old Deacon weart felt more
[25:44] perplexed than ever he asked brother
[25:46] brandom what should I do just put my hat
[25:49] back brother weart I'm going on with the
[25:53] service ma covered her mouth with her
[25:55] hand and shook her head bill could tell
[25:57] by her that she was
[26:00] laughing John Ryan Bill's old friend
[26:02] from up North had been in Jeffersonville
[26:04] that week visiting around the gutsy old
[26:07] man had pedal a beat up bicycle all the
[26:09] way from Michigan some 250 Mi but the
[26:13] bicycle had given him so much trouble
[26:15] along the way he decided to abandon it
[26:17] and hitchhike back home with
[26:19] characteristic generosity John Ryan gave
[26:22] the bicycle to Bill who promptly
[26:24] repaired it and spruced it up with a
[26:26] 10-cent can of paint
[26:29] Bill didn't really need a bicycle
[26:31] himself but he thought he might be able
[26:32] to sell it to get the extra money he
[26:34] needed Bill's second unpaid job that of
[26:37] an Indiana State game warden coincided
[26:40] too closely with his work for the Public
[26:42] Service Company that he rarely
[26:44] considered it any extra effort that was
[26:47] fortunate because his work as a lineman
[26:48] was strenuous enough for two jobs one of
[26:51] his main task for public service Indiana
[26:53] was patrolling the high voltage
[26:55] transmission lines that stretch for
[26:57] hundreds of miles through the the rugged
[26:58] Indiana Backwoods much of this distance
[27:01] had no roads nearby so Bill often found
[27:03] himself on foot hiking 30 m a day 6 days
[27:06] a week all for just 60 cents an
[27:09] hour still there were other rewards
[27:11] besides money the job got him out of
[27:14] town and Into the Wilderness that he
[27:15] loved occasionally through his capacity
[27:18] as game warden he could help a poacher
[27:21] reform and so protect the local Wildlife
[27:24] then too he would always stop and chat
[27:26] with Farmers working in their Fields
[27:29] invariably the subject came around to
[27:31] God and Bill would get a chance to share
[27:33] with them the love of Jesus Christ
[27:36] sometimes a farmer would mellow and give
[27:38] his heart to Jesus immediately bill
[27:41] would take him down to the nearest Creek
[27:43] and baptize him in the name of the Lord
[27:45] with clothes dripping wet the two would
[27:48] part company both of them rejoicing as
[27:50] they went back to their respective
[27:53] task one afternoon Bill was up near
[27:55] Henryville Indiana releasing some fish
[27:57] into to a creek for the fishing game
[28:02] department he was close to the farm of a
[28:05] friend of his who was sick so Bill
[28:07] thought it would be nice if he stopped
[28:09] in and prayed for the man since the farm
[28:11] was just across a few fences Bill didn't
[28:14] bother driving around on the roads
[28:16] unbuckling his holster he tossed his gun
[28:18] onto the front seat of his truck shut
[28:20] the door and climbed the First Fence
[28:22] forgetting there was a sign at Each
[28:25] corner of the pastor warning danger
[28:27] beware PR of
[28:29] bull Bill hummed a Christian hym as he
[28:32] strolled across the grassy field in the
[28:34] middle of the pasture stood a small
[28:36] patch of scrub Oaks spindly little trees
[28:39] averaging 10 ft High bill was
[28:41] approaching these when suddenly the huge
[28:43] bull stood up and snorted it had been
[28:46] lying quietly in the shade of the
[28:47] gnarled Oak branches out of sight until
[28:50] just then instantly Bill recognized his
[28:53] Peril for this particular gy bull had a
[28:56] far-flung reputation
[28:58] it had been a prized breeder on the
[29:00] Burke farm near Jeffersonville but had
[29:03] always displayed an ordinary temperament
[29:04] and finally had gored its caretaker to
[29:07] death forcing its owner to get rid of it
[29:10] since it was such a prize bull Burke had
[29:12] sold it to this man up at Henryville
[29:14] hoping that the isolated Countryside
[29:16] would allow it no more opportunities for
[29:19] Mischief Bill had known about this but
[29:22] it had just slipped his mind now he
[29:24] desperately sized up his chances the
[29:26] scrub Oaks were too flims in in the
[29:28] wrong direction the fences were too far
[29:30] away that left his gun he might have to
[29:34] shoot the animal and then pay the farmer
[29:36] for his loss the killer bull dropped his
[29:39] head snorted and pawed the ground its
[29:42] long pointed horns did indeed look like
[29:44] the lethal weapons they were Bill
[29:46] reached for his gun it wasn't there then
[29:49] he remembered he had left his holster on
[29:52] the seat of his
[29:53] truck well Lord if the time has come for
[29:57] me to die I want to face it like a man
[30:00] he straightened his shoulders and looked
[30:01] coolly at his foe at that moment
[30:04] something incredible happened inside of
[30:06] him his fear evaporated replaced by a
[30:09] love born of sympathy and understanding
[30:12] unlike anything he had ever experienced
[30:14] before he thought that poor bull was
[30:17] lying out here in the field and I came
[30:19] along and Disturbed him he doesn't know
[30:21] anything different than to protect
[30:23] himself the bull snorted harder and
[30:26] faster scraping the ground with its hook
[30:28] throwing dirt behind it as bulls do
[30:30] before a charge Bill said out loud bull
[30:33] I'm sorry that I Disturbed you I don't
[30:35] want you to kill me I am the servant of
[30:37] God and I'm on my way to pray for a sick
[30:39] man I forgot about those signs the bull
[30:42] charged head down with curv horns
[30:45] pointing dead on target amazingly Bill
[30:48] felt absolutely no fear only love he
[30:51] said in the name of Jesus Christ go over
[30:55] and lay down under those trees the bull
[30:58] continued charging with all its muscle
[30:59] and fury when it was only 10 ft away it
[31:03] threw out its front legs and stopped in
[31:05] a cloud of dust the strang's expression
[31:08] crossed its face as it swung its head to
[31:10] the right then back to the left then the
[31:12] animal turned around and showed Bill its
[31:15] tail it walked slowly back to the scrub
[31:18] Oaks lay down and watched as Bill
[31:20] strolled the rest of the way across the
[31:23] pasture for the rest of the day and many
[31:25] other days Bill marveled at what had
[31:28] happened in that pasture between him and
[31:30] that bull in the face of almost certain

[59:26] tell by my mustache amen but when I was
[59:31] a little child just like you when I
[59:34] needed something from my parents I would
[59:36] go and talk to them and now that I'm a
[59:39] little bit older I re recognize and I
[59:43] realize that God is our heavenly father
[59:47] amen how many believe that God is your
[59:50] heavenly father raise your hand amen
[59:53] then if you believe that God is is your
[59:56] heavenly father then we can go and talk
[59:59] to him amen and when we talk to him and
[1:00:03] we have conversations with him we ask
[1:00:06] him the things that we have need of Amen
[1:00:10] just like when we talk to our parents do
[1:00:13] you understand
[1:00:15] that now many times I will stop in the
[1:00:19] mornings after I have my cup of coffee
[1:00:22] of course and I will sit and meditate
[1:00:26] how I meditate is I close my eyes and I
[1:00:31] focus I focus because I have a lot of
[1:00:35] interruptions and I focus my thoughts
[1:00:38] and I begin to think about all the
[1:00:41] goodness of God and all of his blessings
[1:00:45] and everything he's given me and as I
[1:00:48] begin to meditate on these things from
[1:00:53] deep inside my heart something begins to
[1:00:57] say thank you Father thank you for life
[1:01:03] thank you for this warm home and then I
[1:01:06] just begin to have a conversation with
[1:01:08] him so that's how I do it so one thing
[1:01:13] oh were you going to say something down
[1:01:14] I was going to say that's great Sheriff

[1:01:18] from that is he said when he meditates
[1:01:21] he stays
[1:01:23] quiet and he thinks
[1:01:28] he thinks on the goodness of God Amen

[1:05:35] is
[1:05:35] it is it Jesus yeah we have Jesus here
[1:05:40] through the jar and we have some sand
[1:05:44] and some dirt that represents all the
[1:05:48] dirtiness of the world and the thoughts
[1:05:52] that will distract us from the Lord you
[1:05:55] see that that you see that y so a lot of
[1:05:58] times I'm going to I'm going to put this
[1:06:01] jar down open it
[1:06:04] up I have some water here and a lot of
[1:06:08] times we try to fill ourselves up and
[1:06:11] we're getting filled every day without
[1:06:15] emptying ourselves I want you to see
[1:06:18] hold the jar
[1:06:22] [Music]
[1:06:34] so if you can see what H if you can see
[1:06:37] what happened here we're all filled and

[1:06:45] love to drink some of this
[1:06:47] water no no
[1:06:50] no
[1:06:51] so but if we were just to put this on
[1:06:55] the table and not touch it after a while
[1:07:00] all the dirt and the particles that are
[1:07:02] floating in the water will come down and
[1:07:05] they'll settle at the bottom again when
[1:07:08] we meditate we just sit
[1:07:12] still so that all the dirt all the
[1:07:16] stress all the worry all the confusion
[1:07:21] all the fear all the anger all the the
[1:07:25] pain all the
[1:07:28] voices can have time to just sit sit
[1:07:31] down go back out the bottom so that you
[1:07:34] can see the Lord
[1:07:36] again cuz you can't see the Lord right

[1:07:41] in this guy's head if this jar was your
[1:07:43] head you can't see the Lord there's too
[1:07:45] much going on but if you
[1:07:47] stop think on the Lord let everything
[1:07:51] settle all the particles will go down
[1:07:54] and you'll be able to focus on the Lord
