TRANSCRIPT
========================================
wanted to continue this morning with nothing but scriptures but i felt it necessary or better to be able to go back and read those things that the prophet of our age left us william branham people that are visiting us we welcome you and we want to tell you that uh that we believe that god has sent a prophet therefore when i read and i say thus saith the prophet i'm referring to the prophet of this age whose name is william branham therefore i believe that if we can see some small things here they will be of great benefit for us i also want to tell you that uh brother jose hernandez enrique and i send their greetings to you i saw them in nogales he asked they asked me to greet each and every one of you and i believe brother foster was here on wednesday and brother tommy they have returned home and we pray to god for both brothers whether it be brother foster brother thomas and brother brother jose and brother nyaya for each one of the ministers that are out there working i'm going to begin to read on page 66 of the seals in english it's page 82. the thought in which i have been meditating on is this a man completely surrendered to god is omnipotent i would like to say i sincerely believe that through the message we've proved this that there was a man that surrendered completely and totally to god that man was a prisoner of jesus christ that man is william branham that's the reason why many people mistaken him with the lord jesus christ because it was a man totally surrendered to god however even though we know that william branham was a man completely surrendered to god i believe that each and every one of us need to be and be completely surrendered to god in order to be in the resurrection there's no way that none of us will be in the resurrection if we are not completely surrendered to god that is where i believe that the people converts or changes they place william branham in a separate place totally separate plate from place from us i was searching for the word deity and i don't know how to say it in english the word deity in english more or less is spelled like this deity right but then there's another thing there around there and uh i don't know how to spell it perhaps it's like this d-e-i-s-m-dism deity means having the divine nature this other word deism is having a personal god therefore that god which we have is excluded from human contact it seems like that word is synonymous with the word atheist an atheist is one who does not believe in god atheism [Music] therefore there are people that say they believe in god but they place god in a place really far away and separated from humans and you might say no brother that's the denomination denominations to do that but amongst us it seems like we want to place william branham in a place completely separate from us or a different status than us but the only way that we can be where william branham is at is if we follow the footsteps that william branham has taught us or left behind if he was a man completely surrendered to god then we brother poncho we need to be completely surrendered to god now that's the thought which i will be bringing forth remember a man completely surrendered to god is omnipotent i might not be able to get to where i want to because there's limits this morning but i had a dream which was a pretty mysterious stream this morning and it's been several days [Music] that i haven't i haven't even had an opportunity to come visit my mother you know i visit her daily i don't even have time to see her i haven't had time to see her and i've been worried quite a bit on this on this movement that is around us that surrounds us the election that will be going forth here and also the wedding sup uh uh communion and other things and then also the brothers that have come brother fermin and them and brother tommy who's also coming and trying to receive something on behalf of god and what it is that i must do in all things because you see it's really easy to do say and work but to be in the perfect will of god that's a whole different matter so i was dreaming this morning and in this dream one of my one of our brothers who's here present [Music] while we were worshiping god praying to god in the dream he brought forth a message of prophecy and in this message the message said that god wanted that wanted us to carry out some prayer services notice now and it seems that could it be possible maybe i ate too much last night or what have you because i have already called the people to fasting and prayer i would like to say that wednesday at night we convocated the people to a prayer chain for 24 hours a day and a fasting force for an entire week and the first case that we presented was brother jose so that they could cancel the day that he had been given to be executed and god answered our prayer amen but i want us to continue so that god can absolve him from all things someone might say well brother garcia he's asking a lot well i don't think i ask enough so we need to pray more brothers i believe that if we're waiting for something we're going to receive what we wait for or what we expect the bible says that for everyone that asketh receiveth and he that seeketh findeth and to him that knocketh it shall be opened the bible says that jesus said ye have not because ye ask not and you ask and receive not because you ask amiss that you may consume it upon your lusts so much that we hear and especially the more people that come to be with us there's going to be more problems and the only way that the problems are going to be resolved is if the people unite if the people can come under one mind completely surrender to god so that god can work through his word because his word is what should be guiding us there's no other thing which should guide us and i would like to say that the word the written word we have had it here for thousands of years nevertheless in this time a man came by the name of william branham who brought us in this 20th century not the written word but the spoken word and he taught us what we can be if we surrender completely to god how many believe that the word that brother branham brought is our law so happens that there are churches they've had different people that move to their city where they live and no one no one thinks evil and some time ago when some brothers were coming from nogales the people were shocked they were marveled and they would say why is it that they're going from nogales to phoenix when tucson is right there 60 miles north of nogales is tucson but at the same time they've never stopped to notice that there are people that live in phoenix that every sunday go all the way to tucson well why are they going to tucson being that there's a church here in phoenix so there should be something an attraction that there is in phoenix and the people have not found out that even satan if you don't notice if you notice satan's going to use you so that you are against phoenix and if you without knowing it you are against god i'm going to repeat it again because you see someone moves to another city and nobody says nothing but as soon as they mention that they're going to be moving to phoenix right away a lot of contrary things are spoken about and don't tell me no because i have followed those footsteps how many believe that what william branham said is fulfilled how many of you believe that you are in the message believe that william branham made a mistake how many believe that what william brown said is fulfilled to the t or to the letter let me read you a quote entitled expectations and what is love this is tape number 354 the prophet is speaking concerning the uh the magi or the wise men that came from the east and how it is that they were in an observable observatory waiting for that eastern star and in every city there was an observatory it's it's a tower where the wise men would look at the stars by night to see what time of the day it was or what time of the night it was and even though this eastern star appeared the prophet said no observatory saw that star except those three wise men because they were expecting that star the prophet says in that message that the only way that you can receive something is if you're waiting and expecting the prophet says this they were watching for it i'm waiting for something how about you my my soul is stimulated to the highest just before the coming of the lord jesus you see to see something happen that's going to shake the gentile world before god leaves it yes i'm expecting it in phoenix i'm expecting it i'm looking for it i want you to agree with me and expect it no that's not a quote of brother soto this is the word by word for word what the prophet brought and it doesn't matter if you get upset we only need one man to believe it and i believe it i believe maybe there might be someone there that believes it right so the only thing that is needed is a total surrendering so that god can effectuate or bring forth his word or manifest his word i'm going to read in page 66 the prophet says this before the fall there was no tree never died before adam and a animal wouldn't die before adam and there's only one thing that cannot die and that's god because he's eternal and that's the only way we can ever keep from dying we have to have eternal life in us to be sons and daughters of god is that correct that's the only way i was listening to a tape and i forget the name of the tape but the prophet says it's not to stop drink smoking or drinking liquor because you see a man can do this he can impose this upon him it's an he can force himself to do this according to his criteria and what he has tried to do he he says i'll not smoke again and he doesn't smoke he says but what it is it's to receive a person and that person is the person of the lord jesus christ the prophet says that in order for there to be a person you need that person needs to have a personality and when you receive this person you have to have the personality of that person and that personality is eternal life because everything else shall pass away so when you obtain that person that brings forth a complete surrendering to that personality and you can't help it but to tr want to do the will of god which is written in the word and spoken by the prophet of god of this age everything else will pass away brothers it doesn't matter how beautiful something looks this tabernacle it could have a thousand people but if it's not based or founded on the word no matter how beautiful it is it'll stay there it could be it could be the ridicule or mockery of humanity and even of this whole city and of all the believers just that we're but a few in number but but as long as it's planted on the rock it doesn't matter eternal life is there and that is what we want to give to the people we want to give the people eternal life and the only way that we can do it is guiding them directing them to receive that person of the lord jesus christ in their hearts and that is eternal life the personality of jesus christ is a beautiful thing you see when you have that everything that is contrary to god is removed all that scandal that comes to be amongst the people and the reason why there's such stuff is because there's no eternal life and if there's no eternal life it's because you haven't received a person then therefore it's your personality how can brother jonathan have my personality he's a person i'm another how can sister josefina think like sister jorgenna when they're two different people the prophet the people say every head is a world i have one thought you have another thought but allow me to tell you when you receive the person of jesus christ there's only one thought there's only one mind and here is the mind of christ anything different to that there's no you must receive the person of jesus christ in order to have eternal life you can say amen to this right brothers i'm going to continue reading same page page 66 in english it's page 82. now of course when adam fell to death he brought death upon all creation now he was given free moral agency in it was given to them just as we so to make a choice therefore each one of us we have free moral agency there's not anything that is forced upon you each one of us we have to choose in like manner as adam each one of us have the right to choose if we're going to go into the tabernacle and we're going to behave the way we should behave everyone has free moral agency for every little thing that we do we all have free moral agency the ladies that are uh not married or single they have their own choosing or their own choice and free moral agency when a boy asks them to say yes or no they have free moral agency you see people have the choice and then that same people are the ones that complain there's no reason to complain that's the reason why the prophet said it's this isn't a denomination he said each one of us has a choice we can choose what place they're going to call their church does that the prophet say that yes and that man should make that his church whether it be an evangelist whether it's an apostle whether it's a prophet whether it's a teacher he has to be in one church anything outside of that is against the word that william branham brought he must have his church and he must support the cause he must pay his tithe he must give an offering and he should back up the pastor 100 because there's only one head in a church and that head is the word of god that brought william branham that william branham brought through the pastor is that correct brothers now notice these things we've spoken for for years but it seems like many people have not understood i would like to say and i want you to notice what i'm speaking that a person that doesn't have a place like this i don't know how he can be in the resurrection because the prophet says that it is the pastor the one that leads and guides therefore if there is a ministry of a teacher or evangelist that teacher and evangelist must recognize the pastor because if he doesn't discern the body of the lord how can he then be part of the body because my body discerns my my arm discerns my hand and my arm doesn't take the place of my eye or of the nose or of my mouth but all my entire body is one united as one therefore if we believe the word we are going to place ourselves in obedience to the word if that person if a person has a free moral agency they can decide whether or not they're going to obey the law or the order of the church in this tabernacle and no one forces you to obey it but since this church has made a decision to be a church a group of believers she also the church also has free moral agency and her free moral agency that she's taken is that if someone doesn't obey the law well they can be dismissed and send him home until he learns to subject himself to the law of this tabernacle can you say man brothers because it seems like it's the battle of armageddon here i would like to say that i have three deacons and we're gonna put four more i'd like to say that the law or the execution of those deacons is the supreme word of this tabernacle and i don't want anyone to mistreat my police officers because someone will tell me brother it's just that i do this and that well you have free moral agency to do whatever you want but i i want you to listen closely the deacons also have the authority of god of the prophet of the word and of this church to jail anyone who is contrary to the word of this church not only with a literal jail but also in chains which are bound those people that are bound those people that are souls in prison that can't be set free see the people have not never been able to understand what the sovereignty of a church a local church is it has authority supreme authority you can do and undo whatever you want to as long as there's no law but as soon as law is applied then you'll stop going around the way you are and i want all of the police officers in this church to apply the law it seems like when the police officers start to apply the law it seems that the people think that they are our enemies oh no apply it even harder as brother galdona said a squeeze is a squeeze it's not just oh my brother no no no squeeze on it and grab him by the by the neck i've always said that there's no devil or a person in this world that brother garcia is afraid of but i stay on my territory i'm not gonna go to someone to satan's territory but here in my territory whoever comes may come i know where i'm standing and i have all of heaven backing me up therefore so do the police officers are you understanding me therefore there's free moral agency you say well i i don't obey the law of the tabernacle well that's your right to disobey but it's also our right to cast you out all right did you hear me right to cast you out and don't you leave go and say oh those brothers don't show love no no brothers this is free moral agency oh brother armando you're gonna marry me sister don't marry sister gloria marry this other lady over here oh i'm gonna marry whoever she wants to well she liked he liked the little dark one so he's gonna marry the dark one well that's the way you are if you want some other kind of church you can choose it but if you choose this church as your church your responsibility is to back your church and obey the laws that are within this church free moral agency i'll put that to the side now back there in the beginning with adam and eve in the beginning there was a tree of right and wrong before them and that same tree sets before each and every one of us you hear me edward edward this tree of the good and evil is before you it is before me it is before you it's before brother paul it's before each and every one of us and since we're under free moral agency we can choose to do good or evil why is there why is there so many difficulties because the majority of the people choose to do evil and they want others to follow them to do evil because that false vine is always trying to uh a bend the true vine because both vines are interlaced and it is a continual fight between the true vine and the false find and the false fine are are those that or those that belong to that vine they choose to do evil but those that choose those that are of god they choose to do good sister margie nobody's chose forcing you to do one thing or the other you remember the anecdote that i uh like to speak on that the one the brother that would always say the devil was chasing him you remember that there's people new there's new people here that don't know that story well there so happens there was a brother that every service he'd get up in the middle of services the brothers pray for me because last night that devil was really after me and the whole congregation is praying for him well it so happens that one day at nighttime a brother saw a brother from the church saw him and he said oh there goes my poor brother i'm going to follow him because the devil's always chasing him and when the devil begins to chase him i'm going to help my brother so he follows him right he follows him from afar and that man goes to a little place and where there was it was dark they turned off the lights and and there he was they had they turned the lights off and he knocked on the door gently when he knocked on the door someone opened the door they saw him they went back inside into the house and they came back out and gave him a little bag that brother was carried the bag with him and he began to walk down the street and every few steps he would tip something that was in that little bag he would tips it well it was a bottle of liquor and a few blocks later that brother was always complaining the devil was chasing him was was was zig-zagging all over the place like a snake next service the brother stands up again you know the little drunk guy he says brothers please pray for me the devil was chasing me last night but the other brother to follow him said no brothers please don't pray for him because last night the devil was asleep and our brother went to go wake him up therefore before us lies good and evil and many people say brother pray for me but they never pray for themselves because the evil is there and they choose to do bad and wrong and evil but then they want all the congregation to be praying for them so that he doesn't do evil when the other man when he the man is always choosing to do evil now if a brother falls into a trap of the devil and if he's trapped and he asks for help that's a whole different matter but i'm talking about that man that continually brother pray for me so that god can uh god take this desire of smoking away and you you have a pouch a cigarette here and rolling papers over here and yeah all the time he takes out your cigarette and you smoke it and oh when will god take this desire away well how is god going to do it there's people that say oh brother pray for me but so that god can uh stop me from cussing brothers before each and every one is evil and good is before us no one's pushing you or forcing you or taking these men with a shotgun and takes them to the bar is there a deacon here that's chasing you and forcing you to speak evil of your brother is there someone brothers i'd like to know so that i can call the deacons therefore before us lies good and evil we are under free moral agency in like manner as were adam and eve the prophet says i'll continue reading you say well it's their fault and that's what the people say they always blame adam and eve no he says he said well i wouldn't be in the condition i was in if it weren't for adam and eve they say brother brown says well it's their fault no brother brown says no not now it isn't it's not now it's not adam and eve's fault it's your fault you can't blame or place it on adam now you can't place it on adam now you can't place it on adam now you've got to place it on yourself you've got to put the blame on yourself because that's where right and wrong is at brothers that's where the wrong thing is at that's where the wrong thing is the prophet gives us the prescription and we preach and we believe that the brother the message of the prophet but not only the laity but also the ministry but the ministry they're the first ones that transgress or break the word now i'm not speaking locally i'm speaking worldwide they infringe break transgress the word of god notice you brother brown says you got to place it on yourself personally look for a brother for you to understand me a brother has a bad temper and then he says well it's just that paul little paul he just he just pokes at me oh jonathan he provokes me and i i'm just short tempered well it's a saying without it's a mexican i must i'm short-tempered man and i just can't take it you have to accept the blame personally don't blame paul or jonathan blame yourself because you're short-tempered you are to blame now that's the thing brothers that sincerely has brought a great error or failure people take this message as an intellectual message a minister should not bring this message first of all unless they die and are born again you must accept the blame personally as long as you don't accept that you're so tempered jealous envious you cannot find relief from that do you believe that a man or woman they're jealous are going to be in the resurrection and i'm now i'm talking i'm speaking you know what i'm talking about right that's a excessive jealousy uh do you believe that a short-tempered man is going to be in the resurrection oh someone might say oh but jesus got angry did you know jesus got angry but when did jesus get angry when they brought the children to him for example and he began to bless them and to take him in his arms and bless them and then the apostles or someone said why why does he do that look at all the time you waste with those little kids and and we're we're big and we've been with you day and night and you don't even glance at us jesus the bible says that jesus got angry well if you get angry if you meet the same conditions that's fine if you if you get angry because the people don't obey the word and the church order that's okay if you get angry because your wife wants to be on top of you stepping on top of you well that's okay that's what many happens with the prophet the prophet says the prophet says the woman misbehaves and then the man says oh god bless you my pleasure starling god bless you and then the woman cast him outside the man says god bless you honey i'll i'll come back he says what you need is a backbone not a wishbone there's the correct anger when you broke when the word is broken we must be jealous and zealous of the word with knowledge the the jealousy or zealous must be according to knowledge not without knowledge but each and every one of us have to accept our blame personally because before each and every one of you is good and evil in the same way as it was placed before them that was the third thing how many of you have been redeemed by the blood of the lamb let's see raise your hand very well how many have not been been redeemed by the blood of the lamb how many new people do we have here how many of you have not been redeemed by the blood of the lamb all of you one two four once again how many of you have been redeemed by the blood of the lamb thank you when a now been redeemed he don't care anymore for scholarships he don't care for any more of the things of the world the wisdom of the world he don't want no choice at all christ has been his choice you see when you've been redeemed it's because you have chosen christ you say no one can force you you yourself must choose christ you understand me victory brother pancho you understand you must choose christ and when you've been redeemed the prophet says christ has been your choice and that's all of it he's redeemed he's just no more wants to lead himself although this is tremendous what if paul chose mary why would he be looking for another young lady to choose he already chose is that right brothers therefore when you have chosen christ there's there's no one else to choose because now there's two the prophet says in each one of you there's an election three they're voting i voted once that was for christ i got to win the devil voted against me and christ voted for me depends on which way i cast my vote so if you have chosen god or voted for christ there's no other choice to make what happens with many of us is that we say that we have chosen chosen christ but we're not satisfied it's like that brother that uh this is true brothers they tell me it's true they said a brother was praying and said lord sucker me which means help me he wanted to get married sucker me lord and so happens that he married a girl by the name of socorro and she was fatter than me and said lord i asked you for a soccorro or sucker and you gave me a big huge sucker me see he wasn't satisfied so a lot of people have said that they've chosen christ but they're not satisfied to follow christ because christ is the anointed word and to be able to to be able to be correctly placed you must be obeying the word and the word must be living through you we must be satisfied because we have made this choice the prophet says everything was finished there when you chose he is redeemed he no longer wants to lead himself brother leyva he don't want nobody to talk to him where to go and what to do he just waits and finds out the choice of his maker see he doesn't want nobody to tell him many are bear are still married with the denomination others are married with the church others are married with an individual but we should be married with christ the word that should be our choice and our decision brother oh bernie you're contradicting yourself no i'm in the word well no you just contradict what you say a few moments ago no because in the word there's an order a five-fold ministry for the perfection of the church but it has to be within the word the pastor just as much as the teacher or the prophet because there are still prophets okay but major prophet there's only one and that's william branham that's where all choosing and election has finished there's there's no point in choosing any other brother johnson there's no point in going out to see how i feel this morning to see if i feel good enough to pray to god or feel good enough to hear a tape or read a book or to hear tape or to praise god i i want to see who i feel like doing it no no no no you you've got no choice left just as we get up in the morning rubbing our eye our little eye crusts and and eating eggs with potatoes and tortillas and chili we have made our choice for christ we should get up meditating on christ reading the books hearing the tapes taking the bible because that has been our choosing day and night blessed is the man that meditates on the law of god by day and night this isn't the halfway thing brothers this has been your choice there's nothing else to choose but to get up in the morning amen if we could all get up in the morning thinking about the word meditating on the message meditating on christ meditating on the messenger of the age we would behave a little different to the way we normally behave but there you are like uh like those that had one foot in and one foot out but christ calls those that have one foot in one foot out adulterers he wants someone to serve him and him alone and may not may they not be flirting with the world because there's a lot of people in this church there are a bunch of flirts many flirts in this message as soon as a brother or the sister doesn't watch it and they look at the world hello baby they tell the world hello baby you might say no you should measure the words that you have spoken during the week see how many spokens see how many words that you spoke would be accepted or rejected by christ oh you should see how i can't stand those deacons that lalo i can't even see him in on in a drawing or a painting that other one alex much less romero who forget about it and it's worse now that they put a couple of uh of gunmen there on the sides i'm sure that many of you have said that during the week oh well i thought brother garcia was going to preach the word look what you look what he's got here now notice now these are people that are one foot in and one foot out and that is the people that are always pointing and complaining the prophet said all those that are pointing nine times out of ten they're the ones to blame because one finger is pointing that way and three are pointing right back at you you should accept your blame personally what is what we need here in this tabernacle what i need to do is to be born again and you must say father here i am i surrender completely to you i i give myself completely to you that's what there should be most of in tab in the tabernacle like crying a clammer a cry don't you think you're going to be born again on a flowery bed of ease how many women here have given birth has there been women here who have given birth raise your hand when you gave birth you were smiling and all happy right drinking a coke and pepsi no there was pain there was groaning there was crying do you think that the birth is going to be anything different no sir to be born again you need to groan you need to cry out you need you need to cry the prophet says that the church should be giving birth a woman the prophet says there's many women in this day they don't want to give birth anymore because they don't want to lose their shape isn't that what the prophet says and there's many churches brothers that don't want to give birth because they don't want to lose their shape or their form they need to lose their shape they need to get a little belly and when that stomach is all stretched out they can't help it anymore because they know that if they don't have birth pains they're always going to be with that big belly there and they begin to cry out and they begin to cry out and they begin to look for the face of god saying lord i want to give birth and the more the closer the time comes the pains the birth pains are harder but once that child is born that mother takes that child and begins to rejoice that's the reason why the bible states he that goeth forth and weepeth bearing precious seed shall doubtless come again with rejoicing bringing his sheaves with him a church that does not give birth cannot be the church of the living god and in order to give birth you need to be impregnated with the word and the word or orders us that we must be completely surrendered to god a church brothers a man completely surrendered to god okay joanna now adam sinned by heeding his wife's reasoning instead of holding to god's word don't listen to the reasoning brothers accept the word of god and the prophet says i don't care who it is whether brother labor or brother burnaby whether it's brother paul brother campo whoever it might be you must come in the same manner that every single son of god has come a new birth a total surrendering not something intellectual no sir you must receive the person of jesus christ within you so that he can change your personality totally don't listen to your reasoning reasoning will tell you look you already accepted malachi 4. you pentecost you already went through pentecost you don't need this allow me to tell you that that's reasoning because the prophet said that the first doctrine that jesus taught was the doctrine or the main doctrine was ye must be born again the prophet said that a church that has no doctrine is not a church he says that a ministry that has no doctrine is no ministry no wreath don't reason but take the place of the word that's what adam that's that's the way adam sinned his wife reasoned with satan and then produced the product to adam and adam turned loose the word and sold out he lost also his inheritance when he lost his fellowship and right to life how can two walk together unless they be agreed the ones that are walking together or should be walking together is you and god and he is the word and when you lose your fellowship with god or the word you have lost your inheritance if you have been redeemed how many want your inheritance again brothers we need to be in fellowship with christ the word let us pray divine father we thank you for your word for every person that's here lord help us to be faithful to it your word may we stay lord planted and rooted in the word [Music] it matters not how much we are criticized or how we're scoffed or how much we're mocked but we will stay on the side of your word and if we do so we will have eternal life and that is what we desire lord to have fellowship with you so that we can be heirs of the inheritance which you have left us when you redeemed us we don't want to be like those that have sold their birthright but we want to grab a hold of it we don't want to set loose your word your prophet said that adam loosed himself from the word but then jacob came and he grabbed a hold of you help us to take you at your word lord to accept it believe it receive it and live it lord in the name of the lord jesus christ amen uh 8 20
