Louis Missouri they raised $11 so he could go and I think he borrowed a suit jacket is that not right brother I believe it is he borrowed he borrowed a suit jacket to go to the to what would be what would turn out to be a major revival in the beginning of brother Brennan's national ministry in 1946 in st. Louis Missouri we pick up the story after brother Brennan has decided to accept the invitation of Reverend Doherty to go to st. Louis Missouri he had to make some very hard decisions but he made a promise to the angel the angel in that cave that he would serve the Lord Jesus Christ and so we're so thankful that he that was revealed to him and we're looking back on that at this point many years later we're gonna start this final half of chapter 30 the final half chapter of book 2 the next day he quit his job at public service Indiana in his post as an Indiana State game warden at church on Sunday bill told his congregation about the upcoming revival in st. Louis he also explained his promise to God that a Betty Doherty was healed he would move out into the evangelistic field and stay there as long as God met his financial needs so that he would never have to ask people for money then bill delivered the last sermon he would preach in Brenham Tabernacle for many years he took the subject of little David defeating the giant Philistine warrior Goliath it seemed a fitting text because like young David bill too was unfairly matched against his enemies he was a penniless small town preacher stepping out in faith to fight some of the giant evils of the world sickness pain and spiritual ignorance he was not worried about his lack of qualifications and resources because he knew that God was with him and with God all things are possible as the story of David and Goliath proved Margie Morgan accompanied Bill and made it to st. Louis along with several other members of his church Robert Dougherty rented a circus size tent and advertised to revival meetings around the city only a few dozen people came on the first night of the revival bill told him how an angel had met him and given him a commission from God to take a gift of divine healing to the peoples of the world next he had margie Morgan come up on the platform and give her testimony and what a spectacular testimony it was a month and a half ago Margie had tossed in bed delirious from pain for hours had seemed numbered the cancer had consumed her beyond hope then God performed a miracle now she felt as strong and healthy as she had ever felt in her life after this Betty Doherty bounced up to the front she too looked as healthy and energetic as any seven-year-old girl could be with these two testimonies as a background bill preached a short sermon in the people to have absolute faith in the promises of God to heal then he called for those who were sick to come forward 18 people came to the front for prayer one of the first people bill prayed for was a 70 year old woman who had a bandage wrapped around her head she also had a growth the size of a golf ball on the end of her nose taking the woman's right hand in his left the back up Bill's own hand turned an angry red and begin to swell he could feel the vibrations throbbing from the woman moving through his hand up his arm and all the way to his heart he studied the group of white bumps that formed on the back of his puffy red hand they moved just like the pattern of bumps he had seen when he touched Margie Morgan's hand it's cancer isn't it he said the woman said that it was after bill prayed for her healing in the name of Jesus Christ the throbbing in his own arms stopped the swelling went down in his arm returned to its normal state the old pronounced her healed even though the cancer stood out clearly on her nose next bill moved to an old man who had hobbled forward leaning heavily on a cane the man told bill he had been crippled for many years when bill took the man's hand there were no vibrations so bill claimed God's promise in James 5 14 15 is any sick among you let him call for the elders of the church and let them pray over him anointing him with oil in the name of the Lord and the prayer of faith shall save the sick and the Lord shall raise him up bill touched a man's forehead with a drop of olive oil as he asked Jesus Christ to heal him before bill had finished his prayer the man threw aside his cane and marched away as sound and fit as he were 20 years younger picking up the discarded cane bill hung it from the crossbars above the platform so the evening went one healing after another that night to deaf people received their hearing and a blind man received his sight of course not every healing was visible but everyone who came forward for prayer claimed that something supernatural happened to them after bill prayed the crowd went home very excited news of such spectacular miracles buzzed around the local grapevine in the following night every seat in the tent was filled more chairs were provided for the next night and still it left many people standing it was the same for the rest of the week-long revival the tent was not big enough to hold all those wanting inside still those who could not get in did not go home they pressed near the openings to hill-hill hear Bill preach hoping they could get a chance later to come up front for prayer and the healings bill had never seen so many healings and miracles crowded together into a single week people were delivered from cross ties arthritis ruptures tuberculosis diabetes heart trouble infantile paralysis tumors cancers nervous disorders stomach troubles and on and on those people who had diseases bill identified by the sign in his hand he began to draw a rudimentary understanding of what the gift in his hand could do apparently the life of each germ related disease vibrated to a specific frequency his left arm was physically reacting to those vibrations the white bumps that appeared on the back of his hand interests him interested him the most the patter of bumps seemed to be different for each disease by learning the meaning of each separate pattern he should be able to diagnose any disease caused by a demonic presence whether germ or virus he was certainly getting plenty of practice on Saturday night a 93 year old man with a long white beard was carried up front he had a peg leg and a glass eye but his prayer request was for his hearing he was completely deaf after being anointed with all in prayed for in Jesus name the man could hear even a whisper on Sunday night a 65 year old colored minister was led to the front the man had been blind for twenty years bill pointed a flashlight in a man's face without getting so much as a twitch of an eyelid he prayed for the man anointing him with all and calling on the name of the Lord then bill held his own hand in front of the man's face and asked can you see my hand the man quivered excitedly yes yes I see something it's dim and blurry that's my hand said bill keep your eyes on it and tell me when you can't see it anymore bill walked backwards across the platform keeping his hand in the same position at eye level when bill reached the edge of the platform over 40 feet away the man suddenly looked up and shouted praise the Lord I can count the lights I can see the cross arms they're hanging from on Monday morning a number of ministers in the city came to Bill's hotel room to ask him if he would continue the meetings for another week bill said he would pray about it and let them know when a minister's left bill and made a knelt to ask for the Lord's guidance after they had prayed a while and both their voices had fallen silent made a felt led to read from her Bible she opened it at random and began to read from Isaiah chapter 42 behold my servant whom I uphold mine elect in whom my soul delighteth I have put my spirit upon him he shall bring forth judgment to the Gentiles i the lord have called thee in righteousness and will hold thine hand and will keep thee and give thee for a covenant of the people for a light of the gentiles to open the blind eyes to bring out the prisoners from the prison and them that sit in darkness out of the prison house the old felt this was his answer had not he seen prisoner set free in this last week even to the opening of blind eyes calling the st. Louis ministers together he told him he would continue with the human revival for another week that night he preached a full tent and prayed for the sick until one o'clock in the morning the prisoners continued to be set free from sinus troubles gall stones glandular diseases defective vision high blood pressure arthritis and cancers nothing seemed able to resist the faith of the people in the power of Jesus Christ one man had an arm that had been paralyzed for 29 years after prayer he could swing it around over his head a crippling woman who had to be carried in walked out by her own strength a man who had tuberculosis and his bones of his right leg walked and stomped his his once diseased foot without feeling a bit of pain a woman holding an infant told bill that the baby never opened its eyes bill prayed in Jesus's name and the baby's eyes came open one night an 11 year old girl named Evangeline Getty brought a younger boy to the front who was deaf when Bill heard her story he had her repeated into the microphone Evangeline said that Bobby's parents did not believe in God but she believed she had seen what God can do so she had brought her friend Bobby to the meeting to be healed bill anointed Bobby withal and prayed for him in Jesus's name Bobby's hearing was restored this was not the only deaf child heal around 12:30 one night as bill was getting ready to close the prayer service a man burst through the back of the tent hollering brother Branham wait don't close yet the man led a twelve-year-old girl up to the front he explained I'm a minister from Northern Illinois some friends called me and told me how our Lord Jesus was answering your prayers I drove all day to get here so you could pray for my daughter she's never heard a sound in her life she was born deaf anointing the girl with a drop of olive oil bill turned his eyes up toward heaven and prayed softly please dear Lord restore hearing to this child in the name of Jesus Christ the girl jumped as those startled throwing her hands up to her ears she ran to her father she can hear as each nightly service began some of the people who were prayed for earlier in the revival came forward to tell about their healings such as the old woman who had a cancer on the end of her nose that same night she was praying for that cancer dropped off leaving an indentation where the growth had been another elderly woman showed how well her hands work now explaining that for the last two years both her hands have been crippled and useless after a failed operation a man who before could barely move due to rheumatoid arthritis demonstrated how effectively he could now use his limbs a younger woman told how she had injured her left foot breaking the metatarsus bone which then bolts just under the skin the doctors could do nothing for her but 15 minutes after bill prayed for her she felt her foot grow cold looking down she was surprised to see the swelling had subsided and the bone had moved back into its proper place by the last few nights of the revival so many people were crowding around the platform for prayer that bill could barely move from one person to the next with much difficulty he managed to pray for each one wanting prayer but it meant that does services lasting into till two o'clock in the morning when he finished each night he was so weak that Reverend Doherty had to help him walk to the car adding to this taxing workload during today Reverend Doherty took bill on house calls praying for those who were too sick to attend the nightly meetings finally his first healing revival ended leaving bill excited about the future by faith he had stepped into his new evangelistic ministry and God was blessing during the last eleven days bill had touched and prayed for over 1,000 people prisoners were delivered from prison but had not been without cost physically bill was drained still he felt satisfied because he knew he had tried his hardest to further the cause of Christ unfortunately in st. Louis he had established a pattern for his campaigns that in two more years would almost undo him completely god bless amen as we seen when the saints again will be introducing the the sunday school
