TRANSCRIPT
========================================
through ear phones may the Lord richly bless you through his word amen amen now father as we're in the moment that we're about to go into your word we ask that you bless it Lord that through it we may be able to receive what we need and when all things finished we'll give you the honor and the glory in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ amen open up your Bible Brothers to the Book of Mark 11 verse 11 verse 23 reads like this and in the morning as they passed by and they saw the victory dyed up from the roots and Peter calling to remembrance said unto him Master behold the Fig Tree which thou curs is withered away and Jesus answering said unto them have faith in God for verily I say unto you that whosoever shall say unto this mountain be thou moved and be thou cast into the sea and shall not doubt in his heart but shall believe that those things which he said shall come to pass he shall have have whatsoever said amen you may be seated Brothers this evening I greet each one of you in the precious name of our Lord Jesus Christ we welcome all those brothers that have been able to get here this afternoon Where We Gather to praise the Lord at the same time to hear his word which is the one that gives us what we need that we can survive in this tremendous day which we're living in only God's word is the one that can give us the necessary light that we need to walk for every moment I'm going to start reading where I left off last Sunday and it's that I'm done with the message now titled God's power to transform and I want to see if I can get ahead and further on the subject which I'm taking adoption and we found some small things there it so happens that brother Spooner he asked me a question on Monday and the question he asked me is concerning it's in regards to those things that we've been studying and as he asked me what he needed to ask me I told him brother I must tell you that I don't I truly don't know because he asked me in regards to a character in The Bible in regards to what he represented and I told him I didn't know but I've continue upon a study on that and I believe I've come to find an answer in that matter but I don't know when that time will arrive or the appropriate time to speak and that's more question that the brother as which has taken us to a tremendous thing and you know the prophet in the Bible teaches us that the worker is should always be studying right and meditating in God and when there's a small thing that gets there and he doesn't know that it's better for him to say that he doesn't know it and the prophet says if there's a question then there's an answer to that and we've been studying the message adoption and this is number 28 last Sunday we got to the part where how is it that the men lost the Earth think that the man was the god of the earth and how is it that that small thing is the inheritance that men receive from God's behalf and naturally as him being a wise God he gave him also the title deed that property and then we mention that when men sin the Earth or it was returned to Satan hence because man sold it or he forfeited as brother brandham says in English forfeited but being that Satan he made himself the owner of the Earth and he claims to be the owner but here we see that the title deed did not remain in s hence but that the title deed returned to the hands of God which is the original owner and if you follow me I believe that when we get to that small portion of that title deep transaction then we're going to be able to understand one of the more things that has created more discussion amongst the message of Malachi and it seems that in the small things it's where the human being hits bumps and it seems that he can't conceive or be able to catch that small thing but if we're humble towards God and we believe what the prophet has left us without adding or taking away in its due season God's going to help us to place those pieces which we at times haven't been able to position or place correctly even though we say a small thing or people might say in question well how can that be well we answer that's what the prophet said but even further on in our journey the Lord gives us the answer to that question which people ask us you see then the key is to believe all the word that has come out of the mouth of God and when we get to this small part in chapter five of Revelation to speak of the return of the tit of deed remember that next Sun that last Sunday I mentioned that in this 20th century the Lord Jesus Christ gave the title D to William brandham right it seems that at first it seems a incredible thing a paradox but the prophet that's how he says it further on we're going to prove it where is it that the prophet says it not only does the prophet say that God gave him the title deed to the seventh angel or William Bram but he also gave him the right to eternal life because remember when Adam lost the title deed to Earth he also lost the title deed or the the right to eternal life I believe that that is where people in this [Music] message have stumbled they've stumbled and they've gone out with different interpretations so happens you know that there's a a angel and truly they have the right to say this because everyone is under free moral agency but there must be a reason why people get confused it's not a coincidence but then we see how some believe that William brandham gave the Baton or G gave the command to someone else be that he gave it to an an individual or another individual and most people believe this and they follow this but all this stinks there must be a reason why people believe this I believe that in this message of adoption and where we're at now that the man that that says to this mount a man fully surrendered to God because he's the only one that's going to be a partaker of the Resurrection he that is fully surrendered to God that he be a prisoner and that the title deed has passed to the hands of William brandham notice keep that on mind we're going to begin to read there in the book of the seal page 69 67 Spanish forgiving and 83 in English the prophet says like this Adam lost his inheritance the Earth and we see right away that the Earth is an inheritance to Adam now the Earth passed from his hands to the one that he sold out to Satan see right away we see and he tells us that Satan sold himself he sold out to Satan and I was reading here a scripture which my dad me mentioned to me on Monday there in Romans 7:14 the scripture reads like this for we know that the law is spiritual but I am carnal sold under sin so then we see that not only Adam sold himself out but he sold the entire human race out and as he sold himself he was selling out the earth and the prophet says that the Earth went to Satan H and says that Adam it went from his hands to Satan's hands the Earth and there shouldn't be a confusion correct we all understand that the Earth stayed or remain in Saint hands and that's the reason why the prophet says that the devil is the God of this evil age or if this evil world or of this 20th century so you can understand me better so let us go see where that title deed remain page 69 of of the book of seals and page in English it's page 86 I want to make a reference to this page before reading it to you and it's because I'm going to be reading in Span to Spanish and that one that hears mean the tape or those that will go back and check the Spanish you're going to find out that I'm not reading it word for word how it is in the book because I I am correcting it where I believe that in his in he makes a great importance and it seems that we take a lot of time correcting the Spanish books but when we're going to speak on small things that have great importance I believe it is necessary to correct where the mistake is at because the people wants the word that came out of the mouth of God which is the prophet William Mar brandom can you say Amen to this brother and the the prophet says like this page 69 in Spanish the title D now remember one thing is the property and the other thing is the title brother borunda sometime he purchased a vehicle 768 76 he bought a 76 dson right and he purchased it I believe he financed it through the bank right and he doesn't have the title but the the the real owner is the is the bank until he finishes paying off the car then they give him the title when he has the title then no one can take that car away from him but as long as if he doesn't pay the car then they're going to repossess the vehicle my niece was telling me that she had a car and that she hadn't done the car payment for 2 months and all of a sudden the car went missing in front of her house and she says that she called the police and said police officer they've stolen my vehicle and he said no we have here in our records the notice that the bank has the one that you owe your payments to they've repossessed the vehicle because you haven't paid your two payments and they have the right because they have the title brother Ernie knows that if he doesn't pay make the car payments then they're going to take repo his vehicle and he can't do anything because the real owner is the one that has the title so one thing is the property and other thing is a tital deed now let us notice the title deed that had been lost is now in the hands of the original owner almighty God when Adam lost the title deed to the Earth and to eternal life I want you to notice it's not only the title or the Earth but it's also the title to to eternal life very well Satan's dirty hands could not takeen so since they were dirty hands of Satan he couldn't hold on to or take a hold of the title of Earth or eternal life that's why Satan offers life but yes he offers life but the life that he offers s life is death because it's a perversion of Life see so then the prophet says Satan's dirty hands could not take it so it went back to its original owner God himself now and who's god brother God is spirit is that so Brothers now remember this we're going to see this things next because there he sits on the throne with his hand with the title deed this is another thing that I want you to think on because I don't know if I'm going to have time to hit on the small things when Adam had the title deed it couldn't go to the dirty hands of Satan but it went to God's hand now the Bible says that at his right hand there's seven stars and truly there is a tremendous message the hand of God and the prophet says that this makes me feel religious the title de to eternal life as title deed to eternal life when Adam forfeited that when he forfeited for wisdom in of Faith which he wanted more then it went back to to the hands of the owner he didn't even have one a stop for a second there with say no directly went to the owner the hand God Almighty what a great thing because if Satan was able to remain with the title for a bit everything would have been lost but as soon as he lost the title he sold it and there satans they're just wanting and trying to take a hold of the earth and he lost the title deed direct w to the original owner God Almighty what a tremendous thing the prophet says so what's taking place here he begins to go into a drama and look how how how beautiful this is title deed is in God's hand waiting to be claimed through Redemption remember brother Spooner if you can follow me as best as you can Spanish remember that the claiming period is this this is when the Redeemer claims is subject in the right to claiming is through Redemption redemption or restoration they go hand in hand and the prophet says there's a way to redemp the way to come back the way back and someday the Redeemer is to take it back you see where we're getting to now watch this fellow sitting up on the throne all right waiting for Redemption claims its Redemption and I want to call your attention to when the prophet he spoke this message that we're reading on when he spoke on the Gap getting ready to go into the church ages he took chapter 5 of Revelation so then we see that he seated we see that he's seting on the throne and he has the book in his hand and he's waiting for uh Redemption claim it's Redemption so I go in in original English the prophet says what is this book of redemption this title deed Abstract title deed I might not say it very well in Spanish but the prophet says this title deed Abstract title this title deed Abstract title deed that's the reason why I go in English because in Spanish this is not found so what's the D of redemption what is this book of redemption this title deed abstract forgive me Brothers what you say abstract what does an abstract mean means it's search all the way back to its beginning so it means not only does he have the title de but it's an abstract what's taking place on the title and then he answers what does an abstract mean it means it's search all the way back to its beginning and I went to the dictionary and says like this abstract which means a quality with exclusion of a subject as white so it means that there is no complaint on that deed there's no debt when the prophet speaks to us further on that when man sinned he lost he sold out the earth and the property rights to eternal life and the title went to God's hand but Adam could not claim the Earth because there was a debt he had sold himself out and when something has been sold back there possibly like when a brother there has mortgaged a home and he has a title and he has full right to that home but due to so and so reason he seems obligated there to mortgage or there to pond so you can understand me that property then that title is their stay and he cannot that home cannot be sold unless otherwise you first pay off their on the on that dead and when Adam did this that title went back to God's hands but there was a Deb against that property but here where the Prophet is speaking to us he says that it's an AB title saying that there was no Deb so then in order for us to get to where the Prophet is calling our attention is that the price has already been paid for and when he goes into this drama and when he goes into this act there our spiritual s must open up because here is where the prophet's saying he says you be very alert because if you can't understand the small things when the other things come by they're going to go over your head and here the prophet is speaking to us on the small part where we must catch it and it is that this is a title de that an abstract has taken place and not only an abstract has taken place but it's something that has been examined all the way back to the beginning it's been examined so it means that it has a beginning so let's say you want to research on a property here in Phoenix you can go to the court and there where they have the archives there all the legal documents you can find out from the very first owner throughout all the other owners up to today and that is what an abstract is there had only in one original owner and that is God so then God had given it to Adam man and he forfeited and when he forfeited he sold Satan did not keep that title deed no but like God got it and he said this belongs to me and I've inherited to my son and I purposed in my heart knowing that men will fall and that he will forfeit this I purpose a substitute that will come and pay the price and will redeem that property so then I cannot allow this title to be tarnished by dirty hands as Saints hands and when we get here to this scene the title deed is clean and there is no dead against that property are you following me Brothers very well allow me to keep reading I'm trying to remain as simple as possible so you can follow me the prophet says and he gives us an example it's is the example as we gave this morning of that small ink drop and remember I'm reading from English it say the example that we saw this morning of that ink and drop it when that drop fell in in the bleach it went back to its origin and you don't find no more ink then you you try it one day take some ink and and drop it in in the bleach and he'll go back to its origin and take that ink drop from the bleach and try to ride with it you won't be able to ride with it because it went back to its origin now here's the key brother and when sin has been confessed it's fallen in the blood of the Lord Jesus Christ oh Brothers there's given an abstract I want you to notice here in Spanish it says abstract but that's not correct because that's not how English says it he doesn't say he gives him an abstract title that's why people get mistaken and I want to remain there even though I just stay there brother I want to make it clear and I want to get it right because I want to prove it through the Bible and through the message that the title is in William bram's hands and how am I going to receive the title no no no I have now the faculty to give and receive eternal life but notice he's given an abstract and goes back to the Creator in other words you get to be a Son of God see when there's not a stain against earning then an abstract is given to him there's no there's no drop so then he gives back to the Creator to be before the presence of the Creator he's a Son of God he's omnipotent that's why he has the word and the power to create because he's been able to go back Direct L where that title deed is at because the title deed is what gives you the right to what you possess or what you have and if man was the owner of the earth and when Jesus Christ paid the price at Calvary for that stain or Deb that was there left and he send it to that seventh angel messenger the seventh angel messenger brought us the revelation and we catch this and then we see that it's not because of our merits because the prophet is giving us three stages unto Perfection and he's always he's giving us number 13 the first thing that man has to understand that he is a [Music] sinner and that the Lord is calling him through a gospel and when he recognizes that he is a sinner he must confess his sins and as soon as he confesses sin the prophet says that sin falls on the blood of Jesus Christ and when the sin falls on the blood of Jesus Christ it takes him back directly to takes you directly to the Creator and sin goes back to Satan and Satan is responsible for that sin that you committed but the key is that you must confess that sin the Bible says that if you believe with your heart that Jesus ra that God raised Jesus Christ from the dead and you confess with your mouth the Lord Jesus Christ right that then there must be a confession that's the reason when I was speaking with brother Thomas this day I tell them I find out of the fault that has been amongst the people and the reason why the prophet speaks that the Virgin foolish virgin did not have oil and you follow the prophet that every time he says that when they came and asked for oil or there white said you go and and and buy some because man needs to come before God and confess his sins he that confesses his sins shall prosper but he that hides sin cannot receive a blessing because sin remains on the shoulders of that man but when he confesses sin then sin falls on the blood of Jesus Christ and goes back to the individual to the presence of the Creator and he is a Son of God and what he ask God answers because all Heaven backs God's word now I understand why the prophet says come quickly and let us reason together oh brother see it's so easy just to go there as we've done we go there to the furniture so and so and we ask for credit and we only go and we go and ask for something buy something and sign it and they give us the material but all of a sudden the owner is going to ask come quickly and let and let us pay every cent and every dollar that we purchase but here the Lord's calling us because man has taken on so much dead and we find ourselves now bankrupt brother aosta now if our sins be as Scarlet Red they shall be as white as s the brother Bram or the Bible says if they were like Scarlet Scarlet Scarlet's a collar a red colar that's no wonder the prophet said that when they become when you put red on red you get white and when your sin is red as Scarlet but then you confess it and as you confess it it falls on the blood of Jesus Christ that's Scarlet Red and then it becomes white it's an abstract there's no de there's that's the reason why many people can't they can't Brothers barely barely they can walk why you know why because they carry their sin but then get rid of the sin confess your sin surrender to God's hand and say my God I'm a sinner I've done this and immediately you fall it falls on the blood of Jesus Christ and it takes you back to God's presence let us read psalms 517 versus that way read every time read them but it's something is sayah forgive me Psalms 517 Psalms 517 and the psalm of David reads like this purge me with his and I shall be clean the prophet says that his was a common Earth that represented faith and Purify Me with faith and Faith cometh by hearing and hearing of the word of God how shall they believe the Bible says of him who they've not heard and how shall they hear if there's no one to preach to them P Purge me with faith give me the Revelation father doesn't matter how my sin be black but that I only confess it and that it fall on the blood of Jesus Christ Purify Me with his even though I wash with so and so even though I go to so and so Church even though I recite so so creen it doesn't matter it doesn't help me but Purge me with his give me the Revelation oh father that way sin can fall on a blood cleanse me wash me and I shall be wider there will be in abstract the blood of Jesus has paid the price for Humanity sin what you and I need is the Revelation Purge me with his let us go see if there's more more more Bible for this forgive me Exodus 12 Exodus 12 you don't want to Purify Me with the Methodist Church or so and so Church Purge me with his 12 21 then Moses called for all the Elders of Israel and said unto them draw out and take you a lamb according to your families and kill the Passover and ye shall take a bunch of his and dip it in the blood that is in the Bas and strike the Lin and the two side PO with the blood that is in the Basin and none of you shall go out at that door of his house until the morning don't come out of there Brothers until the morning but go and PR yourself with his believe it receive it as a revelation and what is it that you receive brother you have confessed your sin your sin has fallen in the blood of Jesus Christ and you're given an abstract oh brother but but but you this that the other oh blessed be the name of the Lord well what fault do I have the dead Jesus Christ paid it amen but you're a sinner I am the worst of Sinners but I've confessed it with Revelation and you receive it with Revelation brother when men asked he needs to believe if you shall have faith and you tell this mountain you tell whatever it is whatever it doesn't matter whatever it is confess to the Lord Jesus Christ let us prove it with the book of seals page 70 there in that same and you get to be a Son of God the title de is in the hands of almighty God your confession means a legitimate confession and possession to all that was lost by Adam and Eve oh my friend what ought that to do to a born again Christian it's legal possession to that abstract deed title deed of eternal life means that you possess everything that Adam and Eve lost oh Brothers what are this to me brother I have eternal life to me brother I'm going to be there in the resurrection oh but brother Bernie you I don't care whatever you tell me I tell you that I've taken his up a a a handful of his up and I took it through the word and you know who's the one that sound the trumpet it was a certain sound not a uncertain but through the seventh angel messenger the Apostolic Church never gave me this sound they would tell me if I had a sin after getting baptized I was completely condemned but the certain sound told me take a handful of his up confess your sins and let it fall on the blood and let it be disintegrated completely being now that I'm a Son of God even though the devil does not like it and if they call me oh roller and if they call me to the piano please they call me a Holy Roller and they call me a Holy Roller I won't go back I won't go back and tell the devil that he's a liive Purify Me Oh Lord with his now I understand why your Prophet says that unbelief is the only sin Lord I challenge this people that they may awaken and understand what is faith in your word then not go to any place but them go to you and pick up that his up of those tapes Lord that are anointed with your word written word and everything that's present there at the altar so that there may be an abstract and that may raise each one of your children consciously that everything has been paid Lord those that have not understood this Revelation reveal unto them those that have not been baptized in Christian baptism reveal to them Father and bring them back lord before it's too late I ask ask it in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ amen God bless you good thank you for being a part of the service and if I could it up I would just say wow so let's get into these petitions for Thanksgiving to the Lord for some birthdays brother
