[47:14] man I uh you know I'm I'm a I I can't
[47:17] wait for them to get
[47:20] married they want to wait till
[47:23] November and I told my daughter I said
[47:25] what what do you to wait so long
[47:27] for was well we want to make something
[47:30] nice for the
[47:31] church something nice for for you know
[47:34] our wedding
[47:37] ceremony don't don't worry about that
[47:40] even if you give us sandwiches and a
[47:42] piece of
[47:43] cake that's
[47:46] it and the reason why I can't wait for
[47:48] them to get
[47:50] married we're a missionary
[47:53] family brother Bernie has asked us
[47:57] 15 16 years ago to be on the missionary
[48:01] field and my family and I have always
[48:03] been
[48:05] together and I can't wait to take this
[48:07] young man with
[48:09] me brother Alex trained him out
[48:14] there he trained them in the field
[48:18] so I'm excited this morning I'm very
[48:22] happy and as you all know this pretty
[48:24] girl that we have before
[48:29] around so they can see
[48:32] you this pretty girl is Anna Ruth Romero
[48:36] fio Anna Ruth Romero for those of you
[48:40] who didn't know
[48:41] this she also comes from the lineage of
[48:44] the fio
[48:47] family and I believe that's very
[48:51] awesome I believe the fio family is a
[48:53] very special family
[48:57] brother Francisco fio one of the best
[48:59] ministers that we have known in this
[49:03] message I I have a lot of respect for
[49:06] him and his
[49:08] family so for for for for for her to be
[49:13] AIO that really means a
[49:16] lot and so I'm very proud that uh she's
[49:20] my
[49:22] daughter she's very gifted when it comes
[49:24] to music
[49:28] as you all know she plays the
[49:31] organ the guitar the bass the drums the
[49:37] violin and and I I I
[49:40] truly is how you call it
[49:44] girl and as you know she's a very good
[49:49] pianist I believe she's one of the best
[49:51] pianist in this
[49:54] message
[49:57] and I wouldn't expect anything less than
[49:59] that because she's been watching one of
[50:02] the best pianists that we all
[50:08] know which is my sister
[50:11] Joan and you all know she's
[50:14] good and so I'm very happy and I
[50:18] besides I'm I'm I'm getting very close
[50:20] to
[50:23] 50 she's uh and I can say this because
[50:26] she's my
[50:28] daughter she she's already 25 years
[50:31] old so she's not 18 or 19 or 20 she's
[50:37] 25 so she better get
[50:42] married I I love going to
[50:45] Disneyland and I can't wait for her to
[50:47] have her
[50:48] children so I can have fun with them in
[50:53] Disneyland before I turn 60
[50:57] [Music]
[51:01] I uh I I I I want to thank them
[51:05] first for honoring our
[51:08] pastor the reason why I'm I'm I'm
[51:10] speaking in
[51:11] English is because he doesn't speak in
[51:15] Spanish so I can't wait to get on his
[51:17] case for that
[51:20] too he's going to have to learn
[51:24] Spanish and uh I I I respect both of

[54:40] first as as you look at
[54:43] Anna is is this the the girl that you
[54:46] that you love and and have chosen to ask
[54:49] for
[54:52] marriage is is she the one no doubt
[54:55] okay we just want to make sure
[54:58] that when I came to brother Paul to ask
[55:01] if I could marry my my
[55:05] wife ask one
[55:08] question let me ask you just one
[55:11] question I go yes sir he goes uh can you
[55:15] live without
[55:16] her and I said why do you think I
[55:19] brought her to
[55:20] you I can't live without her I think
[55:23] that explains why I married so
[55:27] soon and so we just want to make sure
[55:29] that he
[55:31] knows there way in the
[55:34] world that you can live without her and
[55:37] that's the main
[55:38] thing Anna is this the the man that you

[55:47] to they've known each other for about
[55:49] two
[55:50] years so so this is not something that

[1:14:06] the side of the Lord God of the Lord
[1:14:09] above all that were before
[1:14:22] him
[1:14:26] okay now verse 31 says and it came to
[1:14:30] pass as if it had been a light thing for
[1:14:32] him to walk in the sins of jeroboam the
[1:14:34] son of nebat that he took as a wife
[1:14:37] Jezebel the daughter of ethal King of
[1:14:41] the zidonians and went and served Baal
[1:14:43] and worshiped
[1:14:52] him
[1:15:00] you may be
[1:15:01] seated this morning we're going to be
[1:15:03] continuing on the on the the study that
[1:15:06] we have taken up a few quite a few
[1:15:08] months
[1:15:11] ago on jeel
[1:15:15] religion those some may
[1:15:19] think that my
[1:15:21] focus is to attack the the
[1:15:25] sisters it's not
[1:15:27] that how many of you remember that I
[1:15:30] said that you you would notice the
[1:15:32] change in my Ministry that it would be
[1:15:34] different that I would be uh it would be
[1:15:41] different like for example I I don't
[1:15:43] have to preach to brother uh Emilio
[1:15:47] brother's
[1:15:52] generation you know and other brothers
[1:15:54] that I see here brother
[1:15:56] art but those that that have been us had
[1:16:00] been with us since
[1:16:03] Filmore that those over here when
[1:16:05] brother Bernie preached
[1:16:07] uh Dogma number
[1:16:13] four remember that he got he got
[1:16:16] attacked
[1:16:17] for back there with a little baskets so
[1:16:20] to have the sister the ring whatever had
[1:16:24] and remember he
[1:16:27] got but many of the younger
[1:16:31] people do not have that historical
[1:16:37] perspective they they really don't know
[1:16:40] what we're
[1:16:45] about they don't know that brother
[1:16:47] Bernie unless you heard it a few a
[1:16:49] couple months
[1:16:52] ago
[1:16:55] number
[1:16:56] four when he preached pretty
[1:17:00] hard that's what talked about
[1:17:05] Fashions he said I have haven't even
[1:17:08] touched three% of what I wanted to
[1:17:14] say so if he would able if you were if
[1:17:18] time would have
[1:17:22] allowed
[1:17:23] he would have preached
[1:17:26] 33
[1:17:28] messages 3 33 * 3 is 9%
[1:17:32] right yes or yes are you nervous you I
[1:17:37] don't know what I'm going to say so I
[1:17:38] know what I going to read but I don't
[1:17:39] know what I'm GNA
[1:17:40] say PR for
[1:17:44] me so he would have pre he would had to
[1:17:46] preach 33 messages to complete out
[1:17:52] the I'm going to finish off with the
[1:17:54] fascist
[1:17:57] today my target audience I told the
[1:18:02] brother is not the older
[1:18:10] generation it's those that are around 35
[1:18:12] to
[1:18:15] 40 That's the max Maxim all the way down
[1:18:19] to about what what are the ones that
[1:18:21] come over from Sunday school 16
[1:18:25] gradu that's what I'm talking to so many
[1:18:27] of you say yeah I already I already I
[1:18:29] already knew
[1:18:31] that I already I knew that that's okay
[1:18:34] this you're supposed to know that but
[1:18:37] those that don't know
[1:18:39] it brother Bernie told me when you go
[1:18:45] somewhere so I have more I I think I
[1:18:48] have more of an approval from him to
[1:18:49] bring a teaching here in Phish
[1:18:51] tabern
[1:18:55] phoen and uh so um I I ain't a
[1:18:59] teacher because I I retired as a
[1:19:03] teacher yeah I don't get paid as a
[1:19:05] teacher
[1:19:06] anymore yeah I'm not a
[1:19:09] teacher but uh we're going to be talking
[1:19:11] about Jezebel's
[1:19:14] Fashions so we talked about the shoes
[1:19:17] two
[1:19:19] times before that we talked about
[1:19:21] Washington and then Abraham remember
[1:19:25] that they talked about two times on the
[1:19:27] shoes we didn't I didn't even finish it
[1:19:28] CU I only touched a little bit about
[1:19:33] it remember I'm attacking
[1:19:37] Jezebel not the
[1:19:41] sisters because the word of God
[1:19:43] says come out of her my
[1:19:47] people come out of that Harlot Jezebel
[1:19:51] system
[1:19:57] she's got to come out of us
[1:19:59] too I catch myself thinking like that
[1:20:02] jeze with that Jezebel
[1:20:09] logic because we're that's what we're
[1:20:12] taught say that again that's the way we
[1:20:14] are
[1:20:15] taught try to be a little bit more
[1:20:17] specific in my pronunciation because I
[1:20:19] kind of Mumble a little bit that's
[1:20:21] fine
[1:20:24] our children are taught in that
[1:20:30] system they all
[1:20:34] inclusive oh we're all just one big
[1:20:36] sweet group
[1:20:40] now didn't brother say that we're all
[1:20:43] one great sweet group
[1:20:48] now but Satan won't let it stay that
[1:20:51] way
[1:20:54] in the last just the last seven
[1:20:56] years seven years seven
[1:21:00] years we have one of the greatest
[1:21:05] presidents
[1:21:11] greatest that has kept his
[1:21:16] word and I respect him for
[1:21:21] that I respect the
[1:21:24] office but I I don't respect that
[1:21:28] man but I respect one thing about
[1:21:32] him that he
[1:21:34] said that we he said we are going to
[1:21:40] transform
[1:21:42] America
[1:21:44] fundamentally we going to fundamentally
[1:21:47] transform
[1:21:51] America
[1:21:53] now those of you that that uh hate
[1:21:58] America I know there are some maybe
[1:22:01] here there are some of you there on the
[1:22:04] internet that are in the
[1:22:07] message like I said I didn't know I was
[1:22:09] going to
[1:22:12] say you can at least be happy for
[1:22:21] him
[1:22:23] giving America what she
[1:22:29] deserves don't tell me that that spirit
[1:22:32] is
[1:22:32] here I already feel it
[1:22:35] cuz already attacking my legs
[1:22:42] here think about what he's
[1:22:46] done he has kept his
[1:22:49] word Satan said I will Ascend above the
[1:22:52] Stars stars and be I'll be like the most
[1:22:54] high
[1:22:58] God in the house of
[1:23:01] God be as like as

[1:23:07] given promise
[1:23:10] fulfilled Obama promise given promise
[1:23:14] fulfilled why doesn't he do this it just
[1:23:17] he's got to do
[1:23:19] that he ain't going to do
[1:23:21] it because
[1:23:24] stubbornness is as
[1:23:29] witchcraft how many of you know that
[1:23:31] that
[1:23:32] scripture only three or four of
[1:23:36] you read

[1:25:08] okay I just want to quote what brother

[1:25:15] rationalize with
[1:25:17] him okay I'm not being mean either right

[1:25:24] we already talked about uh us
[1:25:26] paralleling Israel we talked about
[1:25:29] twice finish off from F fashist
[1:25:32] today brother
[1:25:34] sisters it's going to get gooder and
[1:25:36] good when we get when we start talking
[1:25:37] about the the the woman next
[1:25:41] time you're going to see how she's all
[1:25:43] around her
[1:25:46] she's uh we're going to talk about her
[1:25:48] religion
[1:25:51] then and it's going to get like a almost
[1:25:54] like a PG
[1:25:57] message PG-13 16
[1:26:01] here because I'm have to say some things
[1:26:03] that are pretty
[1:26:04] harsh it's all around
[1:26:08] us and we think it's
[1:26:11] okay then we're going to get into
[1:26:13] religion
[1:26:15] then because you won't understand the
[1:26:17] religion now you you won't know what to
[1:26:19] be looking for now unless you know what
[1:26:22] she was back
[1:26:24] then then when you see what she was back
[1:26:28] then and then you look over here you're
[1:26:30] going to
[1:26:31] say like me oh my God I didn't know it
[1:26:34] was there there it
[1:26:36] is I ain't angry
[1:26:39] either smile half a
[1:26:44] smile her religion then the modern
[1:26:50] system like I was talking to a uh uh
[1:26:52] someone the other
[1:26:54] day and you might call call it a
[1:27:00] disagreement and I
[1:27:03] said I know we
[1:27:06] disagree but isn't it
[1:27:09] beautiful that all the
[1:27:12] Pastors in the valley are just one great
[1:27:15] sweet group one great big sweet
[1:27:17] [Music]
[1:27:21] family
[1:27:24] think about
[1:27:28] it and then when we finally get to
[1:27:31] it Jezebel the
[1:27:35] witch you saw a young lady presented
[1:27:38] this
[1:27:42] morning those of you that want
[1:27:45] to study everything brother Bram
[1:27:49] said about the preview of the Bride
[1:27:55] and when that church from Asia and other
[1:27:59] countries Europe
[1:28:01] and when it got to the one in
[1:28:03] America a whole filthy
[1:28:06] Bunch was by
[1:28:11] a a
[1:28:15] witch so let's move quickly because we
[1:28:18] have to do I I didn't mean to get into
[1:28:21] that but that's okay I didn't want to
[1:28:24] but the Lord wanted me to say
[1:28:26] that okay so let's let's uh that's what
[1:28:29] we're going to be uh talking about
[1:28:31] brother Bram now I know most of you have
[1:28:34] already done so and I trust that I'm not
[1:28:36] being sarcastic when I and I'll say like
[1:28:39] this I know that most of you that are
[1:28:42] following the message and following what
[1:28:44] brother bam has said what brother bam
[1:28:47] has told
[1:28:48] you hey you have already read or heard
[1:28:56] and as there's a I would
[1:28:59] recommend uh 1956 for you to read paint
[1:29:02] to face
[1:29:03] Jezebel it's a
[1:29:05] pretty hard hitting
[1:29:08] message from there I will be re reading
[1:29:11] a few
[1:29:13] things um don't forget these little
[1:29:16] words coming out of here this just a
[1:29:17] transference over from things happen
[1:29:19] like this I have to say this because I
[1:29:22] who I am sorry these things happen they
[1:29:25] should be down here but follow but when
[1:29:26] they when they convert from one system
[1:29:28] to the other point to other system I
[1:29:32] guess it's worship or something like
[1:29:34] that I'm not sure what uh those things
[1:29:35] come out of there so I try to make it
[1:29:37] pretty for you but that's what matters
[1:29:40] is the
[1:29:42] word Jezebel was a
[1:29:46] pagan she hated
[1:29:49] Jehovah Jehovah God she hated him she
[1:29:52] hated him she married into
[1:29:56] Israel think about that who who
[1:29:59] God was Jehovah she married into
[1:30:07] Israel but she got baptized
[1:30:10] right she got
[1:30:13] Sanctified s
[1:30:17] sanitized
[1:30:19] purified all glorified
[1:30:23] came was a born again Christian is that
[1:30:27] right no she brought her old filthy old
[1:30:30] gods right with
[1:30:34] her now I'll give you a little preview
[1:30:37] of what's coming
[1:30:39] out you know what she brought with
[1:30:42] her the gods of
[1:30:47] sex you don't believe me study the
[1:30:50] message study what brother BR
[1:30:53] said she brought the gods of Sex
[1:30:57] Over did she get
[1:31:01] conver like
[1:31:02] that
[1:31:05] quickly she hated god
[1:31:08] Jehovah she hated God's
[1:31:12] people that
[1:31:14] hatred that sin in her
[1:31:17] heart her attitude and her character
[1:31:20] made her what she was
[1:31:33] click
[1:31:36] click all right I just move
[1:31:41] on we go to the next one brother that's
[1:31:44] so fine if not I I'll like this thing's
[1:31:46] not clicking anymore and we brother says
[1:31:48] we take the same
[1:31:50] attitudes
[1:31:52] towards God and so
[1:31:54] forth we'll get the either the same
[1:31:58] reward we either going to be one of
[1:32:01] them or one of
[1:32:04] those so when you're thinking I'm one of
[1:32:06] them I'm one of
[1:32:08] them you are one of
[1:32:10] them it's your character your
[1:32:13] attitude all these things
[1:32:16] identify as you're really one of
[1:32:19] them or one of them
[1:32:24] those forgive me I was raised in the
[1:32:26] message brother bam 19 years on
[1:32:31] up so 1965 roughly when we started
[1:32:34] hearing tapes brother
[1:32:38] Brown and just to
[1:32:40] relax relax a little bit you can't
[1:32:43] translate this but do the best you can
[1:32:45] okay brother man says don't pay no
[1:32:47] attention to those
[1:32:48] [Music]
[1:32:50] isms
[1:32:56] because there's soon going to be
[1:33:00] WMS heard brother say that right

[1:33:10] forgive
[1:33:16] meos don't forget don't don't worry
[1:33:18] about those
[1:33:20] isms
[1:33:22] Sonos someday they'll be
[1:33:27] wassam that's how brother brandham
[1:33:32] spoke with a play on
[1:33:35] words but what he would say it wasn't to
[1:33:38] make
[1:33:39] fun but it was for us to think about
[1:33:44] just there's only one
[1:33:49] is is
[1:34:01] or an I am because God said I am the I
[1:34:08] am what was God doing millions and
[1:34:13] trillions an Infinity of years before
[1:34:16] that he was he was something what was he
[1:34:18] doing that would make me go crazy
[1:34:23] yes brother and I am I am
[1:34:25] crazy but I'm not
[1:34:31] violent those times
[1:34:35] [Music]
[1:34:40] Brethren is part of the Jezebel
[1:34:47] reasoning it's part of the instruction
[1:34:50] and education from
[1:35:00] Jezebel a long time ago that that that
[1:35:03] never
[1:35:05] existed that time never
[1:35:08] existed time is a
[1:35:11] creation it's a dimension that was
[1:35:14] created and one day I'm going to say it
[1:35:17] like
[1:35:18] this when Elijah
[1:35:25] the Elijah of our day is is the Lord
[1:35:27] Jesus Christ say that
[1:35:30] again oh so that way you don't get get
[1:35:33] Scandal I'm going to say the Lord Jesus
[1:35:35] Christ he's gonna bring these loose ends
[1:35:42] together that's the way eternity was
[1:35:44] before it was a circle see is that
[1:35:50] right
[1:35:53] that's why the bride when when she gets
[1:35:56] engaged they give her a
[1:35:58] diamond right sister Debbie correct de a
[1:36:02] rock
[1:36:04] right I want my my stone was that what I

[1:36:29] right Faith virtue knowledge Temperance
[1:36:31] patience
[1:36:33] godl
[1:36:36] kindness at the end it's pure
[1:36:40] gold that's a seal right that's when the
[1:36:43] adoption comes down that's what we're
[1:36:45] waiting

[1:36:55] penalties okay brother bam said the
[1:36:58] following in the
[1:37:01] message Jezebel religion he said it's
[1:37:05] like this I can't I can't I can't even
[1:37:07] begin to say how he says
[1:37:10] it but I'll say something like this

[1:38:26] with the
[1:38:29] devil faith is our Victory and then in
[1:38:31] paint
[1:38:34] the brother man says then you can see
[1:38:36] why I'm so angry not with
[1:38:40] you with the things the devil that's
[1:38:43] making you do
[1:38:46] that if you go out and clean
[1:38:49] up just because I said that
[1:38:52] you're still
[1:38:54] wrong that's what he
[1:38:56] said you're still wrong
[1:39:02] so brother what what if you had lived
[1:39:05] with
[1:39:06] Jezebel what if you had lived in the
[1:39:08] Days of Elijah and
[1:39:17] Jezebel the 2500 years ago
[1:39:22] how long
[1:39:26] ago00 years
[1:39:29] ago Hollywood was starting
[1:39:36] Hollywood Hol wood uh Hollywood look
[1:39:40] into what Holly and wood
[1:39:44] means what's your last name
[1:39:47] brother not not because of
[1:39:50] him H look for the word Holly and look
[1:39:53] for the word wood was starting with all
[1:39:56] of her pain and
[1:39:58] fashion got all the daughters of Israel
[1:40:00] doing the same
[1:40:03] thing and when one old
[1:40:06] man standing there up there and
[1:40:08] battering against
[1:40:12] it Israel entered into a Decay after the
[1:40:15] fall of Solomon after Solomon's
[1:40:19] death
[1:40:22] I'm going to need some help from some
[1:40:23] strong brothers because we got to break
[1:40:24] through that break that kind of heavy
[1:40:28] right
[1:40:28] now those of you know that this is the
[1:40:31] word of God that I'm saying just say
[1:40:32] Amen to the
[1:40:36] word how many of you
[1:40:38] know that when Solomon
[1:40:41] died Israel entered and broke up into is
[1:40:45] Judah and Israel say
[1:40:49] Amen
[1:40:52] amen then it got worse and worse and
[1:40:54] worse and
[1:40:57] worse until finally the 10 tribes were
[1:40:59] just
[1:41:02] lost then the last two
[1:41:04] tribes they were carried
[1:41:07] away into
[1:41:10] Babylon that's why I love the word
[1:41:15] zerubabel that's why study it and you'll
[1:41:18] see that it refers
[1:41:21] zerubabel the great Prince before
[1:41:25] God the prophet of God told us that he's
[1:41:29] a type he's a figure of the seven Church
[1:41:33] H
[1:41:35] messenger and
[1:41:37] zerubabel

[2:09:41] skin tyght that's the fashion people
[2:09:43] call skin
[2:09:47] Ty I've seen this in
[2:09:52] church fact I know my um time's almost
[2:09:56] up Sunday night at the
[2:10:00] convention and it's not the wrong
[2:10:02] way I had a hard time keeping my eyes
[2:10:05] off a young lady that was just form
[2:10:08] fitted wife knows what I'm talking
[2:10:14] about this a message
[2:10:17] Church to worship God and I wasn't
[2:10:20] judging I was just
[2:10:23] seeing anyway but anyway sisters that's
[2:10:26] skin tight dress we didn't know what a
[2:10:27] skin tight dress
[2:10:30] was I'm going to paraphrase
[2:10:34] this young
[2:10:37] girl used to dress really really really
[2:10:40] beautifully uh Christian
[2:10:44] way dressed correctly I'm
[2:10:47] sor had her hair pulled
[2:10:51] back no
[2:10:53] makeup and her girl friend friend of her
[2:10:55] used to make fun of
[2:11:06] her you didn't have that flat-headed
[2:11:08] preacher that you got
[2:11:10] there speaking of my
[2:11:13] me you would you would look something
[2:11:17] decent
[2:11:22] but you look like something out of an
[2:11:25] antique shop and so she just
[2:11:29] really and she just raked her over the
[2:11:32] coals every time she'd look she'd see
[2:11:37] her our pastor is broadminded
[2:11:40] he has an open
[2:11:44] mind why do you do that why why do you
[2:11:47] why do you you do like
[2:11:49] that that don't mean anything how you
[2:11:51] dress or
[2:11:54] think screams around say says it does
[2:11:57] the Bible says so live by every
[2:12:01] word well tell me where in the Bible
[2:12:03] where it says we how we should
[2:12:06] dress I'll tell you
[2:12:08] secret one of them is Peter book of
[2:12:13] Peter yes sir oh it takes a star if it
[2:12:17] takes a star out of
[2:12:20] if it makes you act like some kind of a
[2:12:21] move star not act like a move
[2:12:25] star if you have to let your hair grow
[2:12:29] down put it on Old Fashioned
[2:12:33] dress I don't care what it
[2:12:36] costs I'll take the way with the Lord's
[2:12:38] despice
[2:12:41] few Lord let's see it
[2:12:44] again let's see the presence of God
[2:12:46] moving before
[2:12:51] don't mean you I don't mean to say you
[2:12:53] have to dress like some something or
[2:12:55] other out of an antique
[2:12:59] box but you can look more like a
[2:13:04] lady you don't you don't want to dress
[2:13:06] like Mar
[2:13:11] Susana want to but you want to dress
[2:13:14] like her you don't want you don't want
[2:13:16] the dress that hangs loose
[2:13:19] you don't know what you're talking about
[2:13:23] W you have to get angry with the
[2:13:27] devil about three or four minutes over
[2:13:29] for
[2:13:31] God I wanted to finish and I didn't want
[2:13:33] to go into I I really really badly want
[2:13:36] to get into the woman
[2:13:39] jeel I want to get into the topic of of
[2:13:42] her so you'll see what what a
[2:13:46] vile but at the same time
[2:13:51] awesome example God put for
[2:13:55] us so you could see during the time of
[2:13:59] Elijah and during the time of worship of
[2:14:03] ba that you could see what Jezebel was
[2:14:05] doing over
[2:14:08] here it's it's
[2:14:10] incredible but it is
[2:14:13] credible for those those of us that
[2:14:15] believe the
[2:14:16] message word of God let's let us

[2:43:54] and sound
[2:43:57] system I just want to let you
[2:44:03] know since we began I say broadcasting
[2:44:11] span since we began to put our services
[2:44:14] in the internet then
[2:44:20] we have 3.3 million minutes
[2:44:28] watched if someone sees the service for
[2:44:30] 10 minutes or the complete
[2:44:35] service accumulates a 3.3
[2:44:41] million this is
[2:44:43] worldwide uh
[2:44:46] this
[2:44:47] convention we almost
[2:44:52] doubled the quantity of people that were
[2:44:54] watching the
[2:44:59] conventions it's because of the effort
[2:45:01] that you
[2:45:03] do and we're so
[2:45:11] grateful as you know I get involved in
[2:45:13] the department of the kitchen
[2:45:18] and even in still in that department
[2:45:20] there's other departments
[2:45:25] um well there's some brothers who say
[2:45:27] the only thing I can do is
[2:45:30] clean but without
[2:45:33] them just imagine the
[2:45:38] trash there's a brother who says I'm
[2:45:40] only the one who gives the water water
[2:45:42] boy the water boy uh
[2:45:45] but I
[2:45:46] answer without water there's no life
[2:45:54] um there's some brothers who all they do
[2:45:56] is wash
[2:46:02] dishes and uh other ones that all they
[2:46:05] do is
[2:46:07] serve and others just
[2:46:10] cook and there's one that gives
[2:46:13] orders uh
[2:46:18] and sometimes we speak a bit
[2:46:21] rough and we want to
[2:46:26] [Music]
[2:46:27] apologize when you're
[2:46:29] working the
[2:46:33] stress and the anxiety Show Your
[2:46:42] Colors and first of all we want to
[2:46:44] apologize if we did something
[2:46:50] wrong because it takes about 45 minutes
[2:46:53] to serve
[2:46:56] everyone and when someone comes to ask
[2:46:58] for a second
[2:47:00] plate they get us when we're
[2:47:05] stressed and we want to apologize for
[2:47:07] that we're not
[2:47:10] perfect but we're going to Perfection
[2:47:13] um
[2:47:15] I've done it for a
[2:47:20] while from what I was to what I
[2:47:23] am night and
[2:47:28] day and now I see the brothers that are
[2:47:30] beginning in the
[2:47:35] kitchen and in 10 years they'll see that
[2:47:38] it's
[2:47:39] different all this is
[2:47:43] preparation more or less two uh months
[2:47:46] before the convention
[2:47:48] begins we're already uh
[2:47:51] speaking I'm speaking about all the
[2:47:55] Departments
[2:47:57] um and what are we going to feed
[2:48:02] them the menu has to be
[2:48:08] tried when you go and buy
[2:48:11] cups uh
[2:48:13] napkins
[2:48:16] each meal we have to buy the right
[2:48:20] things and then the other day I was
[2:48:23] watching a
[2:48:27] documentary of the Queen of
[2:48:30] England and she was going to give a a
[2:48:33] dinner a
[2:48:34] feast and I was
[2:48:36] umed
[2:48:43] amazed
[2:48:46] that everything every meal everything
[2:48:49] had to be
[2:48:52] tried and and I thought well that's what
[2:48:54] we
[2:48:57] do but we just uh serve in plastic
[2:49:04] plates because as you know there
[2:49:06] different things that happen
[2:49:13] um and before I
[2:49:17] forget I would like to thank the
[2:49:21] youth because in this year they helped
[2:49:26] served and I'm very grateful for their
[2:49:28] help
[2:49:31] um they also gave a big
[2:49:36] donation and at the end of this
[2:49:41] year we could return more than $1,000 to
[2:49:45] the funds of the
[2:49:47] church and this is the first
[2:49:52] year and this is a year where we have
[2:49:55] spent less than any other
[2:49:59] year and looks like we had more variety
[2:50:01] in the
[2:50:04] food so after convention
[2:50:08] ends the the work does not
[2:50:13] finish we still have to get rid of the
[2:50:16] trash
[2:50:18] clean to return the tables and
[2:50:21] chairs and many
[2:50:25] things so we return to
[2:50:29] work to be able to
[2:50:33] rest say
[2:50:40] that I want to thank all the brothers
[2:50:42] and sisters that borrowed us their
[2:50:44] refrigerator
