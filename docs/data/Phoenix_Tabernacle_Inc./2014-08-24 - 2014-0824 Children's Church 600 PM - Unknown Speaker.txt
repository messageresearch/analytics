Next time you go, please tell the brothers hello for us. Amen. Yes. God bless you. You know, is there anybody out in the audience that has a testimony about healing? Anybody? Oh, do you? Wow, you're such a pretty lady. Why don't you come up here and give that testimony? That would be wonderful. Let's see if we can get a microphone for you. You look like a beautiful kangaroo with that little guy on your stomach. Can you come up here? Cuz the microphone won't reach you. Let me help you. There you go. What's your name? My name's Lizzie. Can you share with us what the Lord put on your heart? Yes, I can. So, I have a testimony about how God healed my little baby right here, Gideon, this week. Um, so last week on Sunday, Gideon started getting sick. Um, and he wasn't happy. He was really fussy. But I didn't take him to the doctor on Sunday. We just kind of dealt with it. And on Monday, he was just getting worse and worse and worse. And I took him to the doctor. She thought he had an ear infection. So she gave me medicine and sent me home. And at home, I gave him the medicine. and instead of getting better, he got even sicker. Um, you know, for for you parents who who who know the numbers, he had a fever of 105.6 after antibiotics and Tylenol. Um, so I ended up having to take him to the hospital and we were in the hospital most of the week. Um, and the doctors did not know what was wrong with Gideon. They did all sorts of tests to try and find out what was making him sick. And they couldn't find anything making him sick. They just knew he was sick. And it was a hard time for Bernie the third, Gideon's dad, and I because we were battling in our minds when the devil would try and come and tell us things. And I remember saying in my mind, "Devil, why are you bringing this trial now? you know, I'm just gonna go up in church and tell the testimony of how God healed my baby. Amen. But the devil was up to his old tricks. He tried to bluff and he would say, "You're not going to give a testimony. You're going to bury your baby." And that was hard thing to hear. But we had to stand strong and believe that God was able to heal Gideon. Amen. That's right. One of the things that helped us was Bernie's uncle Tim sent us a message preached by brother Brandham. And when we listened to that message, it was a story about another little girl who was sick. The doctors couldn't figure out what was making her sick, but just that it was causing her a lot of problems. And Brother Brandon prayed for her in that sermon, and by faith, I believe she got better. When I heard that sermon, I thought, "Wow, God, if you can do it for her in 1960, Amen. you can do it for us in 2014." That's right. So, we prayed for our baby and held on in faith. And when the doctors would come with more bad news, we had to ignore everything that they were trying to tell us because we knew that God's word was the truth. Amen. And on Friday afternoon, after almost a week in the hospital, Gideon was finally released. The doctors still didn't know exactly what had made him sick. They had a best guess. Um, but they could see that he was 100% better. So, they couldn't keep him there anymore cuz he wasn't sick. So, that's our testimony that God, he's our great physician. Amen. Amen. When the doctors did the best that they could and they couldn't fix what was wrong, God came down on the scene and knew exactly what was wrong with Gideon. And exactly how to fix it. And he did. The doctors had to poke him and all kinds of stuff. Huh. Yes, they did. How many times did they poke him? Oh my. A lot of times. Turn so they can see the vein. Bernie was telling me they poked him like nine times trying to find a vein. because he was so dehydrated, he needed fluids and the veins that they would make contact with would burst because they weren't strong enough. So, finally they had to get an IV in his head and he was poked everywhere and he had wires everywhere. He looked like a VCR. He was just it was a mess. He was crying and it was a heartbreak situation. But finally, when the Lord came down and healed him and took away his fever, remember he was smiling and giggling and and back to his old baby habits like like drooling and and farting and doing all the stuff that babies should be doing. Babies should be doing that, right, Dr. Bunny? It's normal. And thank God cuz he wasn't doing it at first, but then we could smell that he was better. Amen. Can we give the Lord a round of applause? Praise the Lord. Amalita, can you give us a tono on the piano? Oh, see go ahead and we'll grab your guitar. Let's all stand. We're going to sing What a Friend We Have in Jesus. Can we do that? Let's all sing What a Friend We Have in Jesus. [Music] Take over. Take over from Jesus. [Music] We have inus our sins and What a privilege to carry. What a riverless to care.
