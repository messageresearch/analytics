TRANSCRIPT
========================================
[Music] [Applause] [Music] and okay them all to jesus [Music] jesus will turn your sorrows [Music] to jesus [Music] jesus [Music] [Music] um welcome to the house of the lord this evening we welcome you thank you for being with us to work uh welcome to thank you for being with us to come and worship the name of the lord thank you lord heavenly father father celestial we're grateful that you allow us to enter your house of worship for we ask in the name of the lord jesus christ we're also asking lord if there's any one of us that is sick it has a need [Music] tonight we'll be listening to a message apostolic doctrine essential for phoenix tabernacle this is tape number two uh this is uh was preached by brother vernon g garcia january the 19th 2003 this is a bilingual message interpreted by your brother elias ruiz may the lord richly bless you yes praise we greet you in the name of the precious lord jesus christ we're going to be making a small prayer and after we pray you may be seated [Music] for being able to recognize your grace in the name of the lord jesus christ i wanted to give thanks because he gave me the opportunity to listen to the radio program this morning and my soul was delighted as i heard and i want to give a very special welcome to brother thomas perez i understand that he's here although i can't see very well i believe he's here hey let's help when the brother presents him as a as a bosom friend of brother bernie although i know him since we were children but i don't remember those years but i do remember his father and my father and we give thanks to god because he's here apostolic doctrine for phoenix tabernacle my heart desires that each and every one of you reach the place where followers of me even as i also am of christ he never says or is trying to say bg imitators of christ he's saying specifically he imitators of me that's the reason why the profit of the age he told me don't preach me a message give me the message therefore the first commandment that god is the second scripture is to be found in john chapter 14 the one who's speaking here is the same jesus christ our savior you see because we couldn't be redeemed you but if you don't believe in him it is in vain i therefore the prisoner of the lord beseech you that you walk worthy of the vocation wherewith you're called i believe that each and every one of us was called and live accordingly to how you have been when i gave all diligence to write unto you of the common salvation necessarily argentina it was needful for me to write unto you and exhort you that you should earnestly contend for the faith which was once delivered unto the saints it is that we love ourselves one and the other and to be able to understand each other if the people do not understand for years i've said this the prophet says this but if you don't love three messages who have read all three messages three small messages why are we not a denomination that the brother spoke about john who was mute i'll tell you that he wasn't the only one there's a lot of mutes among us amongst us i'll ask you again maybe some of you it was a little heavy with the the the things that i spoke it might have been a little difficult for you and to me it was just very simple there was about 16 or 17 things that i mentioned i'm a human as you are and doing it like this we might be able to finish within the hour the answer that i want you to understand i go back to the title doctrine which is essential and elemental for phoenix tabernacle we are [Music] this morning don't you believe morning john chapter 6 all that the father giveth me shall come to me and him that cometh to me i will in no wise cast out juan said john chapter 6 verse 44. [Music] no man can come to me and shall ascend that scripture should take us to give him an applause for they are thine on a certain occasion we were in the ramadan and they asked a certain question i allowed certain individuals to answer it and and this is what the book of jobs speaks about and all the sons of god shouted for joy so then i knew back then that there was a lot of people that didn't understand but brother branham is telling me when he interprets the scripture in revelation chapter 17 verse 8 when did he place your name when the lord jesus christ [Music] and they agreed you're going to live amongst mortals when you're born you will be born with an incorrect spirit for your way of heart but watch now because i will die [Music] so then i will you're going to because there is [Music] because you are a part of that the man said fine that is well so then we get to the point where we understand i might not be able to say it very well in spanish but he will so look at a picture of when you were young and good looking they'd say about 21 years of age what a tremendous brand of the lord jesus christ and because he's a good contractor where his children were to dwell in [Music] hey the prophet says man is made in the image of god put him to sleep and he took a rib out of man and from that rib he formed woman which is the image of man you see they were won because there was an atom when god's image came there was a masculine and a feminine silence which were in if you follow we surrender ourselves to the word his name is william brown when he did all these things and after he had taken a woman out who's the man that's not afraid to move quickly lightly come it's hard to follow me the doctor he he dares to come because he's a doctor yes oh he knows we must speak with she speaks and to explain to them what god has given us very well he says all of this adam look we can eat of everything everything was fine you see but you see he couldn't really come out and show that he was a savior that mankind fall he knew he had partners and that they were willing and he was going to unite to the the prophet says it's the day of grace about 325 a day the prophets of god and those who had the intellectuals fought for several days with them and finally [Music] in in revelation chapter 7 she's a mother she's the mother of harlot she's not mother of children because the harlot is a woman under liberty because two horns come out of drinking of the wine of her fornication that's why the bible speaks excuse me the prophet speaks about the woman's hair she should not cut her hair in order to be strong of the world the only way that you can be a partner what the name of our messenger not a person who is a stutterer one [Music] much that there is [Music] don't or blame someone else look i was blind teach them [Music] and i can see the people's faces he starts to sing a dollar oh he preached a hard message that that song was a hard song and afterwards it's the first time i hear the song i believe that he's the one that composed it did you compose them [Music] about and the people that listen listen to me or hear me uh take away a religious spirit i'm gonna ask a question i'm gonna take a drink of water and then i'll i'll wait for your answers do know that i have a hard time to put a cd with a cd player you know who it was that bought that cd player for me you also know who places the cds in the cd player for me do you believe that i can forget [Music] who puts them in order i already told you the names of the messages that i want you to hear i want you to hear or read the other day about four o'clock in the morning after having heard many people used to have the um uh the accustomed to call me at about midnight they've already gotten addicted to do that you know who they are you so i help i want my people to hear i listened to the table the very same city i've been listening to she plays it she played it once i played it again and i went quickly let me support that i called my wife hey you know what hon boy i it's because i've promised her so many times and i never fulfill it she was shaken up in slang so then when i told my wife could you please put the cd she played it again for me you know then she said i can't do it it's too much i'll just play it to the people so i'll play the whole thing in about two more months but i want to finish this message who is please i'll just give you 15 minutes in english focused on english and i don't want to kill you but i want you to hear directly from me just sit down and what [Music] [Music] about but such a great cloud of witnesses let us say aside every word everything ever wrong every evil word every bad spoken word every thought let us run with patience the race that set before us looking to the author and finisher of our faith the lord jesus christ oh blessed be his most matchless and holy name how that he came to earth to redeem fallen man and to bring them back into the fellowship of the lord god and we thank thee for this and now by his grace we never chose him but he chose us he said you have not chosen me but i chose you when before the foundation of the world and dear god if there be some sitting here this morning maybe who's cut this off for years and years but constantly there's a little knocking at the heart maybe they joined church thinking well it'll be all right father sure the scriptures has explained it this morning that you cannot hide behind a church and be righteous neither can you be good not lying steal and do anything bad and still be righteous there's only one righteousness we have not of our own but his righteousness he has perfected our salvation therefore being in him god does not see our mistakes when we do anything wrong there's a spirit that screams out oh father forgive me then god does not see it and so we're brought into fellowship and grace with him granted lord while we close this service in christ's name amen just for a moment i'd like to ask you no matter what you do you're lost listen to this some time ago i might have told it before here's a little experience happened to me i was up at the completely ohio i was in a revival and having a meeting down there and so many people they know the hotels is that so they're taking me out into the country i stand out there at a little motel we've been eating at a little dunkard restaurant it was a wonderful place the little ladies in there just as christian and painted looking as they could be clean and real nice sunday coming i got hungry i've been fasting a little and i want to go across the street to another order a little a little road there by a corner and there's a just a regular common american place there to eat little had a little face of cafe open all night when i walked in there on that sunday about two o'clock in the afternoon before going down to the preach that afternoon i was so gotten i didn't know what to do i walked in and the first thing i noticed was a young lady about 16 18 years old some papa's darling some mother's daughter standing that guy was a boy with her hands around her hips a bunch of teenagers sitting at the at the counter i heard a slot machine looked over here and there was a policeman standing there with his arm around a woman up around here a waistline playing a slot machine now you know that gambling and slot machine is illegal in ohio you buckeye people here and you know that's illegal and here was a law playing a slot machine and a man of my age probably married a bunch of children maybe a grandfather a policeman rode patrol playing a slot machine there's that you know what's the teenage then what's this done i stood there nobody knows me coming in it was too busy if i'm drunk so i watched i heard somebody saying well do you think the rain will hurt the rhubarb and looked around over here and you're set a lady saying an old lady real she was 65-70 close to and the poor lady i don't blame anyone from looking their best but with she she fixed herself made her hair blue real blue looking all cut off over the top made real blue and she had on real thick uh manicure what you call the stuff but on her face and a big spot and she had on little bitty shorts and a poor old thing was so wrinkled to the meat flat meat was hanging down like that over her leg and she was drunk she was saying there was an old man in the summertime with one of these old great army overcoats on her olive drab and hanging down like that and a big scarf around his neck drunk two of them and there's with this poor old woman i stood there and looked around i said god how can you stand it how do you look at such as that when it makes me a sinner saved by grace think that how can can you look at it well it looked like you burst the thing open will my little rebecca and sarah have to come up under that kind of an influence will my two little girls have to meet a a proper so known world as it is today where the people act like that god how can i ever what can i do versus his grace if they were already eternal life they'll come to it if it wasn't they won't i don't know that's up to god i'll do my part i know how can you stand it god look like you're so holy that you just wiped that thing off the earth i said look at that poor grandmother sitting there look at that young girl back there and here's a woman standing here probably 25 years old and that police with his arms around her waist a plane in the slot machine and there's the law of the nation's gone there's the motherhood gone here's the elder gone and there's a young girl sitting back there and she's gone look at the boys when they ought to be in church or somewhere and i said oh god what can i do and here i am in the city of crying with all my heart and they ignored and walk as if they were well god well then if all come if i haven't called them how can they come all the father has given me will come you have eyes but you can't see ears and you can't hear i thought well the president would come to town instead of the revival everybody come out oh sure that's whirly then i got to think well god how why don't you just go come on jesus let's have it over with i won't just just go and have it all over and let it go then i began to see something moving in front of me it looked like a little whirl going around like this i kept watching and i saw a world turning around and around now washington where it was spraying something off now look there was a spray of red crimson blood across around the world it was like a world going around like a comet and had a whirl around like this and i looked at this world and just above it i saw jesus in the vision he was looking down and i see myself standing down here on the earth doing the things that i should not do and every time that i see him god would have killed me because the day the other day you died god's holiness and justice required and you'd have to die and then i looked at it i kept rubbing my eyes i said i'm not i never went to sleep it's a vision i'm sure this is a vision i kept watching as i stood behind the door and i've seen my own sin come up and every time we would start to hit the throne his blood act like a bumper on the car it caught it and see it shake the blood and run down his face and i see him raised his hands and said father forgiving he doesn't know what he's doing i've seen myself do something else that shook him again god would have killed me right then but his blood wasn't catching me it was holding my sin oh god did i do that surely it wasn't me but it was then i went walking like this like i was going through that room and i walked up close to him i seen a book laying there and had my name on it all kinds of black letters wrote across it i said lord i'm sorry i did this that my sins caused you to do that did i spin your blood around the world but i did i do this to you lord i'm so sorry that i did it he reached out i said will you forgive me i didn't need you all you buy your grace i'll try to be a better boy if you just help me he took his hand and patted his side tucked his finger rolled pardoned on my book throw it over behind him to see if her gift was i watched it a little bit and he said now i forgive you but you want to condemn her so you're forgiven but what about her you want to blow her up you didn't want her to live oh god forgive me i didn't mean to think that i didn't want to do that i i i didn't want to do that you're forgiven you feel all right but what about her she needs it too she needs it well i thought got it i know who you've called and who you haven't called it's my business to speak to everyone so when the vision left me i walked over to her i said how do you do lady and then two men and went to the restroom and she was sitting there hiccuping you know laughing the bottle of whiskey sitting on the table or beer was uncle sitting there where they've been drinking i woke up and said how do you do and she said oh hello and i said could i sit down she said oh i got company i said i didn't mean it in that way sister she looked at me when i called her sister she said what do you want i said could i sit down yesterday she said help yourself and i sat down i told her what did it happen she said what's your name and i said brandon she said you the man down here in this arena i said yes ma'am she said i've been wanting to come down there she said mr branham i was raised in a christian family she said i got two young girls this christian but certain certain things happened and she got on the wrong road and started i said but sister i don't care the blood's still around you this world's covered over his blood if he didn't got to kill us everyone he when that blood's moved look out for judgment but now if you die without that blood you go beyond that place then there's nothing to act for you today the blood acts in your stead i said lady sure the blood still got you covered as long as you got breath in your body the blood has you covered but someday when the breath leaves here the soul goes out you'll go beyond that blood and there's nothing but judgment while you've got a chance for pardon and i'll talk about the hand she's crying so mr brown and i'm drinking i said that don't hurt something another ass warned me to come tell you i said god before the foundation world calls you sister and you're doing wrong and you're only making it worse she said did you think you would have me i said absolutely he'd have you there on her knees we got down in the middle of that floor and an old-fashioned prayer meeting that police took off his head and bowed on one knee there we had a prayer meeting in that place why god sovereign laying aside these dead works let us go on to profession let's move into that realm where these i belong to church and i belong that's all finished let's go to perfection my sinner friend if you're without the blood today without salvation without grace the blood of jesus christ holds you you say well i've got power this time but one day you're going more there's nothing left for you then let's pray now while we bow our heads is there would be one here today would like to say god be merciful to me i realize that i've done wrong maybe you've joined church that's all right but if you haven't received the grace of christ would you raise your hand say pray for me brother branham god bless you mr god bless you lady i tried god bless you sir back there god bless you and you way back in the back yes god bless you raise your hand i try this punish your head up saying god be merciful to me you say i belong to church brother branham yes i've tried to be good but i don't know i just seem like i can't do it oh poor pilgrim poor decrepit friend you've really never seen the vision yet you said brother brown i shouted i spoke with tongues i've done all this and that might be true too that's all right nothing to say against that but my dear lost friend but to speak with tongues or to shake your to shake hands or to be baptized that that's all right but to know him is to know a person to know him his life you say i know the bible really want to know the bible is not life to know him the personal pronoun and know him cries that you know he's forgiven you would you just raise your hands again someone else god bless you lady god bless you sir god bless you over here brother god bless you back there young man god bless you over here sister god bless you way back in the back there that's right to know him is life brother abraham remember me i'm now right here in my seat going to accept christ say come into my heart lord jesus and give unto me that peace that's sweetness go to church play the music as hard as you can dance up and down run through the aisle go home wearing toss and fuss that's not christ you go to church listen to some little sermon about how the bridge is going to be painted or something other like that never hear the word the word brings life it's the seed don't you want peace are you bothered about dying you can have a heart attack today does it wear you or would you rejoice to say i'm going to be with the lord jesus on the end of this road do you know him if you don't just raise your hand we're going to ask prayer for you yes brother you do all right in your heart now just [Music] for whom [Music] oh just walk right to him by faith believe that he's standing right there by your side he is he not here is my soul how much help of one temper malice by faith i walk to the cross this morning i lay my burdens down i come god bless you back don't be indifferent now warmly sweetly walk right up to the cross in the old testament they brought a lamb they know that sin they notify the commandments you know it now because god spoke to your heart they looked at the commandments thou shalt not commit adultery thou shalt not uh do so and so and they took a lamb went put their hands on the lamb priest cut the throat the little fella was kicking and bleeding and blading and dying his hand is all covered with the blood the lamb died in his fins but he walked out with the same desire to do it again but in this place we come by faith through grace god called us we lay our hands on the head of the lamb of god we hear that swinging hammer we hear that voice i thirst give me drink father laying out this sin to their charge they don't know what they're doing see by faith we feel his death there in our sin way then in our heart comes a deep settle peace when a voice says your pardon now go and sin no more how about grace then we walk away with not the same desire but a desire never to sin no more to do anything wrong the peace that passes all understanding has entered a heart may you receive it now while we pray everyone together heavenly father they're coming by faith to grace there's about a dozen hands went up the fruits of the message they come to you they believe i believe in them too lord i believe that truly the holy spirit spoke to them and by faith they're coming right up jacob's ladder now right up to the foot of the cross they're laying down all their sins and saying lord it's too much for me i just can't bear it any longer and will you take away my lord of sin and take the desire out of my heart to do so and let me by faith this day receive you as my personal savior and from henceforth i'll follow you every mile of the way to the end of the journey i catch a glimpse of what it means to go on to perfection not going into church and the roots of dead works like baptisms and so forth but i want to go on until i can be no more if christ can live in me oh jesus grant this to each pitted its soul this morning everyone that raised their hand shall receive eternal life because you promised it they made a public exception they raised their hands they broke all the laws of gravitation they made science feel ashamed of themselves because science says your arms has to hang down anything would prove that in science that it must stay earthbound because gravitation hold it down but there was a spirit in them that made a decision and they defy the laws of gravitation and raise their hand you've seen it lord you put their name on the book pardon the old books back in the
