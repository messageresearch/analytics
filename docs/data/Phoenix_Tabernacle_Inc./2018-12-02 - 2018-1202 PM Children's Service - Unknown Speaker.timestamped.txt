[59:16] Christmas movies and stockings it's it's
[59:20] so much more than that it's so much more
[59:24] than than jingle bells and Frosty the
[59:26] Snowman and gingerbread houses you know
[59:30] but there is a house there is a house
[59:33] that that is important during
[59:37] Christmastime in that houses is your
[59:39] heart and that's the house where the
[59:42] Lord Jesus Christ wants to live and
[59:46] that's what Christmas is about to me
[59:49] about the night where Jesus Christ came
[59:53] down and was born in a manger so that
[59:59] all of us can see that it doesn't matter
[1:00:02] what the situation looks like it doesn't
[1:00:06] matter what the outside looks like if
[1:00:09] you would just be willing to let him be
[1:00:12] born in your heart in the stable in the
[1:00:16] manger of your heart he would come down
[1:00:18] and he would be born and he would be the
[1:00:22] king and ruler of your life and if you
[1:00:26] would make that decision your life will
[1:00:28] never be the same I'm just gonna ask
[1:00:32] that you just think about that well well

[1:06:03] Mary thank you his brother yeah and his
[1:06:05] wife get ready for the for the last song
[1:06:07] and the angel stopped her and said you
[1:06:14] are special amongst women and you will
[1:06:19] give birth to a son and you'll call him
[1:06:23] Jesus and the Bible says that Mary was
[1:06:26] was troubled she she she was shocked and
[1:06:30] she thought what is this what type of
[1:06:33] weight what type of way to greet a
[1:06:36] person is that this angel probably just
[1:06:40] had all this light around them and
[1:06:42] scaring the poor little girl she's
[1:06:43] probably about 14 15 years old we have
[1:06:46] about 14 15 year old girl here girls can
[1:06:49] can you can you stand up our 14 15 year
[1:06:51] old young little girls 13 look at that
[1:06:55] look imagine angel appearing to these
[1:06:58] beautiful young ladies right here they'd
[1:07:00] have to talk to brother Joseph first
[1:07:04] but the angels showed up to these this
[1:07:07] young lady and said you're gonna have a
[1:07:09] son and she's so innocent she said I
[1:07:12] don't even know any guys I've never even
[1:07:15] been with the man how am I gonna have a
[1:07:17] son and he said don't fear for the holy
[1:07:20] ghost is gonna overshadow you and you
[1:07:25] will conceive in your womb and you will
[1:07:28] have a son and you'll call him Jesus and
[1:07:34] you know what she said she was so
[1:07:36] obedient she said be it unto me
[1:07:40] according to your word basically that
[1:07:44] just means sir I don't understand how
[1:07:47] but exactly what you just said I believe
[1:07:51] it and so be it it'll happen to me
[1:07:54] however you say and today that same
[1:08:00] angel and that same message is here
[1:08:03] before us and I'm telling you I might
[1:08:06] not be as handsome as the angel Gabriel
[1:08:08] these lights pale in comparison to the
[1:08:12] light that was surrounding the angel on
[1:08:14] that day and you know what I am just a
[1:08:18] human I fell but I bring an Angels
[1:08:25] message to you this evening and if you
[1:08:29] would believe what I have to say you can
[1:08:33] conceive the Son of God within you and I
[1:08:38] want to say Phoenix Tabernacle you are
[1:08:41] chosen and you're special
[1:08:42] amongst all churches because this night
[1:08:46] God has decided to tell you that Jesus
[1:08:51] Christ the Son of God wants to be born
[1:08:54] in your heart and if you can receive the
[1:08:58] word of God in the womb of your mind you
[1:09:03] can give birth to a life that will
[1:09:07] completely change your world he can rule
[1:09:10] and reign like nothing else
[1:09:17] and you'll change your life you don't
[1:09:20] have to be the same person you don't
[1:09:22] have to struggle you don't have to fear
[1:09:24] you don't have to doubt you don't have
[1:09:28] to be depressed you don't have to have
[1:09:30] anxiety you can have a new king
[1:09:33] rule in your heart if you would receive
[1:09:36] that word can you imagine the King of
[1:09:38] Kings the Lord of lords being born in
[1:09:42] your heart you would think oh why why
[1:09:45] would the King of Kings want to be born
[1:09:47] in my filthy old heart you don't know me
[1:09:50] burning a third you don't know what I've
[1:09:52] been through you don't know the kind of
[1:09:53] thoughts that I think well you know what
[1:09:55] I do know that he was born in a nasty
[1:09:57] stable next to a bunch of donkeys and
[1:10:00] and sheep and and and pigs and and all

[1:16:14] just want to share a little testimony
[1:16:17] how God has everything under control is
[1:16:20] that okay amen
[1:16:22] so my wife had two songs that she didn't
[1:16:25] know what she was gonna sing and one was
[1:16:27] oh holy night and the other one was that
[1:16:29] one and I I made her scene oh holy night
[1:16:33] but God knew he wanted that song to be
[1:16:36] sung and where that came to me what we
[1:16:39] were in the back well after service that
[1:16:41] I already started and he said is
[1:16:42] everyone for one more song we want to
[1:16:44] sing this song and he told me what song
[1:16:46] it was and I thought of course I'm not
[1:16:48] going to get in the way of the Lord
[1:16:50] like if Lord wants that song to be sung
[1:16:53] Amen
[1:16:54] and so I thought that was very beautiful
[1:16:56] thank you before we dismiss I just want
[1:17:01] to give an opportunity for those hands
[1:17:03] that went up because it was quite a few
[1:17:05] hands that went up and we'd like to pray

[1:19:17] didn't start crying and screaming on an
[1:19:19] active Testament Lord they they're
[1:19:21] making a confession with their with
[1:19:24] their movements Lord they walked up here
[1:19:27] to make a public confession that they
[1:19:29] want you to be born in their heart Lord
[1:19:32] Jesus Lord it's the simplicity and the
[1:19:35] foolishness of the gospel that changes
[1:19:37] lives Lord God and out of the mouths of
[1:19:40] babes Lord you will come down to
[1:19:43] confound the wise and the prudent Lord
[1:19:45] because you come in the simplest of ways
[1:19:48] Lord Jesus and as we lay our hands to
[1:19:51] fulfill the scripture we asked that you
[1:19:54] just make yourself known as you are born
[1:19:58] inside first in the womb of there
[1:20:02] mind may they accept you in their mind
[1:20:05] and say Lord Jesus I accept you to be
[1:20:10] born in my heart and to be king of my
[1:20:14] heart and Lord of my life as we do that
[1:20:19] Lord we trust that you'll honor your
[1:20:21] word and you'll honor this faith and
[1:20:24] this act of confession and may they
[1:20:28] never be the same Lord God when they
[1:20:31] never be the same because when Jesus
[1:20:34] comes oh when Jesus comes all things are
[1:20:38] made new we thank you for this and may
[1:20:43] they be a light wherever they go may
[1:20:46] people say well there's something
[1:20:47] different about you
[1:20:49] what happened what's different may they
[1:20:52] say well I accepted Jesus in my heart it
[1:20:57] was quite simple would you like to
[1:20:59] accept Jesus in your heart and may we go
[1:21:02] and cause a revolution Lord even if it's
[1:21:05] a small one in our workplace or in our
[1:21:07] home Lord or on the bus Lord the whole
[1:21:10] point is to change one life for the Lord
