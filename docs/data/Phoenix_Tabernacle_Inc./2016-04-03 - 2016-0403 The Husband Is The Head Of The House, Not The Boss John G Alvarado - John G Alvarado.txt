petitions that we have but if you have a petition that the Lord already knows truly we cannot hide anything before the eyes of God he knows the deepest part of what we have in our hearts if you have a need for something where you think God has still not answered you truly this is the moment where you have to believe him for what he has already done for you not what he's going to do for you he already paid the price for everything you say for a new job yes for a need with my own son who's with drugs or someone that's in the hospital or someone in jail it does not matter God paid the price for everything for all the needs that the children of God would have on this Earth because if we believe that he's the same yesterday that truly we all believe it but how many believe that he's still the same today the same Wonders that he did in the past are the same Wonders that he can do in this day he does not change he's faithful and he stays faithful with us we have to come back and be faithful to him to believe him amen amen we'll be praying for these and for all the petitions that we have read every need that you have in your heart if you can raise your hand and if you cannot

bringing every need that has been presented I have something here Lord I'm happy Lord because you give us what we need not what we want and if it pleases you Lord I Thank [Music] you but I'm still holding on to your powerful hand that holds [Music] me like in those days seeing that neighbor with their thin hands and still raising them up she had cancer they only gave her a few days of life but you had mercy [Music] Lord you moved the heart of Mercy Lord and you came down to the scene and now we see our neighbor walking eating laughing doing exercises how beautiful you are Lord to know that you answer our prayers Lord God for our sister Francis that has brought her Petition of [Music] cancer I believe you're the same yesterday today and forever Lord and if she In This Moment wherever she is at can raise her hands and believe in her heart that all is possible to him that believes that in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ re that demon of cancer and we declare her healed completely delivered and each one of the needs that has has been exposed we pray in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ believing with all of our hearts that you will answer each one of them because since the moment they placed their need they were believing Lord come down to the SE at each one of their hearts and permit them to believe that the miracle can happen we also pray for those brothers that will

Lord put myself into your hands may you bless the people today our purpose to come here today is only to Echo of the word of God that has been brought to us through a prophet of God and he said I am the voice of God for this generation and we are the echo of that word we don't have a message we only repeat what the prophet of God said we have thth the Lord but because it came from the prophet of God now help us to line up with the word of God we want to abide by every word not just part of the word but all the word now help us today Lord in our endeavor we surrender everything to you may everyone be blessed today in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ greet you in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ before we get started I want to read you a quot and uh it's the reason I read this code doesn't necessarily have anything to do with the message I'm going to bring today if God permit me to bring the message today but it's in reference to April there's something special about the month of April and I'm just going to read this before we get into the message I hope they can put it up there on the screen so you could all follow along with me thank you very much how many believe that Jesus died on the cross how many believe he died how many believe he rose from the dead when he rose from the dead he is alive today 2,000 years later the holy spirit is on the Earth today making him Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever Jesus is here in the form of the pillar of fire the Holy Ghost is on the Earth right now seeking out his own his Souls amen and he did it all because of a agapy love now let's get into the coat now on the road to EMAs on the first Easter morning when the whole world was In Bloom with flowers buds the bees are humming on that beautiful April morning little did the disciple know that he he was raised from the dead was amongst was among the resurrection and as his friend Copus and his friend was on the road to EMAs very much discouraged like today many people are discouraged many people are disappointed they think God is dead God is not dead God is alive how do you know he's alive how do you know that can you say like me because he lives in my heart amen amen but they were pondering on the scriptures did you notice while they were talking on the scriptures amen amen isn't that beautiful when you talk on the scriptures God makes himself present and that's what we want his presence that's the difference between an intellectual and a heartfelt religion a conviction a revelation in your heart you know God lives and on the road down the darkest hour they had ever seen and every hope gone and about that time Jesus comes on the seene man I love that and that repeats again in the darkest hour when everything fails and goes wrong Jesus comes on the seene hallelujah hallelujah God never fails but they didn't know him and I'm sure that's the fault of many churches today Jesus is here but they don't know it they don't realize it oh man isn't it awesome isn't that substance when brother B talks I believe it was God's mouth peace to us it was a mind of Christ was not a mind of a man it was God speaking to us it never come to its end and Jesus is still here and people still can see him I pray tonight I'm reading the quote that he will do something just a little different from ordinary religious service that you've been did you might return home like cleopas and the friends from the Resurrection the first day of the Resurrection The Lord Jesus was resurrected amongst the people amongst the flowers and so for on that first Easter April morning when he raised from the dead when did he rais from the dead one April morning wow May that repeat today if you have died to the world if you've had a death burial and resurrection and if you die you will resurrect again we should not be afraid of death the flesh is afraid yeah but inside of our soul a Christian does not fear death come on death it's a way to get out of here this is hell oh it's not the world's falling apart the backbone of America is the family the families of all falling apart divorces homosexuals lesbians it's it's not ju it's not a juvenile delinquency it's parent delinquency and he journeyed and talked to the two men all day long and they still didn't recognize him I wonder if that can repeat again there's no doubt at all but we've talked what you've talked to you and he kept you from having that accident and he saved the baby's life and he brought these things in and help you to pay off the house all these things he did but maybe you never recognized it to be him God is here brother sister amen now what we're going to talk about today I just had to get that out of my way has nothing to do with one the subject that I'm going to talk about today and and before I get started okay I want to insert a little thing here uh how many heard brother brandham preach do you know how how hard he preached raise your hand if you know hard okay you talk real hard I I don't think I've talked as hard as him and when I have been hard I I try to say what brother bam said I am a little nervous and I'm G to tell you why I'm not nervous to get up here in front of you that doesn't make me nervous at all and it it doesn't make me nervous to see how ugly I am that doesn't worry me but what worries me is that I might say something brother Ram didn't say then I'm in trouble with God I I don't know if you know it but I'm between a hard spot and and and a rock I'm under pressure I've got to say what he said whatever I think is is garbage we're trying to repeat what brother BR so when you look at me and you say well look at that's brother Johnny know sister brother get that out of your M I'm try to say what he said he brought us the message we only Echo what he said I'm just going to read you one little part here I'm quoting brother Bram I do not hate women no sir they're my sisters we know the if you're Christian there's Christian ladies that uh real Christians but we know if there's a good woman there's a bad woman right and brother B was really hard on the women he was also hard on the men too okay now saying that let's get into our subject today okay and I've got to still say a little bit more things before I really get into the title today and there's a reason I want to speak on this brother and sister you got to understand one thing uh every man of God has to be led and directed by God I'm not being directed by another man I have to be directed by the Holy Ghost the Holy Spirit has to be how many understand I'm not going by what church this church and that church and that church every Pastor every Minister has to be led of God and he has to walk that tight [Applause] rope and he has to be balanced because if you go to the left or the right you got extremes you got to be balanced and if you're not you're going to fall off so brother brandom the word of God it's it's corrective love is corrective so don't get mad at me if I say something brother R said and what I'm trying to express to you today I wanted it to be balanced not one extreme nor the other now let's go to the title now now I know the the the PowerPoint I have an Apple computer try to convert it over to the regular computer and the code is outside the frame so they have to help me to make them adjust them in each slide and sometimes it just doesn't work out so if they're having a hard time back there it's because it's not their fault it's not even my fault it's the equipment we have but we're but the title of the message today is the husband is the head of the house and not the boss just that title right there huh you like to get yourself in trouble don't you Johnny I'm gonna be honest with you I'm GNA turn the corner here in the Christian Home who is the one that governs or rules or rules or that Manda huh oh wow I'm not getting no response the other day I said something I have a new revelation I even got sisters that back me up oh brother I'm with you and I said I have a new revelation my new revelation is is that I am convinced it's been a conviction to me a revelation that women are the ones that govern or that rule did you know that that's against the word look I'm gonna tell you this man shall not live by bread alone but by every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of all every word I believe in the return of the I believe in in in the tent but that's not the whole message notice if you are not the head of your home you're not going to make it if your wife tells you what to do and my sister you're not going to make it what is the Bible say the husband is the head of the home or no yes or no there's a reason why he is the head but he's not the boss you know what the if you don't fulfill the requirements the boss can fire you he can fire you and he's going to get another one I believe that a man and a woman get married it's not just for a few years it's for eternity and when you give your your vow I said something else because I going to say something else you know that when a man and a woman before they get married they should not kiss each other in the mouth you know why because potentially they're already having sexual sexual intercourse what's that they're not even married yet you're never going to see me to kiss my wife out in public because it's ax ual act the the the sex GLS are thep there's sex glands in the lips okay now how many are following me up until right now this is going to get really hot and heavy here okay no I'm going to tell you something brother Bram says that when you choose a woman you should choose character yes amen is that amen okay uh I knew this before I got married I already knew I had already heard tapes I had heard enough tapes that I already knew that I should choose character not the most the prettiest one the one with the most cous the most sexy one no no no no no no no no character that's right I knew this okay I got one brother when when I was thinking thank you brother thank you brother appreciate it appreciate it brother when I thought on a woman I don't know how this came to be but there was brother Bernie was there and I was in t in Mexico and I was a young man so now if I can tell you what I believe okay let me let me insert something here no notice it remind me because lose the the thought the thought okay oh next Sunday I'm going to be right here I'm going to preach if if God allows me to if God allows me to because I'm not going to finish today because I want to say what brother brandom says okay okay now what was I saying oh yeah so when when I thought on a woman every young man should should get married he's not complete if he doesn't have his wife so then brother Bernie was there and brother Bernie said in in the convention a lot a lot of brother brothers and sisters so then brother Bernie told me you see that one that's over there she's the one talk to her I'm going to tell you how I believe now now before in in the Old Testament when Abraham sent elzer what to choose a bride he knew that Isaac would CH they would choose a woman is that right he didn't choose chose [Applause] her now you think this new generation is going to for somebody to choose their man or woman for her him no sir sir no sir I've told my children and what about this oh Dad she's too ugly okay notice that's in the Old Testament now I believe this I believe that a person in this church you don't have to believe the way I believe but this is how I believe but if you're thinking about getting married if you're young man I should I think I I believe you should go with the pastor for for him to give you a suggestion I did I did it like that okay pastor go with an elder or a Deon don't go with somebody out in in the bar hall or a friend there at school go with somebody that's a Christian balanced that that has a same mind it's not crazy somebody that that's tempered tempered tempered right tempered temp did you understand that that's my opinion it's my Revelation then but I also don't oppose I don't force anybody to believe the or the way I believe now notice what happened there was a sister that came but I'm not going to say who it was and she told me Johnny Johnny look that sister that's over there remember brother ber had already told me this one and the sister an elder sister look that that sister that's over there I said which one which one I looked over there and I saw a a little heav and and as she looked she she was pretty she was she was white white skin she was a beautiful but if you know how I am I'm I'm I'm going to tell you how I am and here I'm going to make a confession I I'm afraid of women I was very afraid of women so what do you think I I did not even with this one the brother or the one that the sister told I'm not going to go with any of them why because I was I was afraid for me to stand before a girl I was speaking in Tong no I can't and then I'd see those big eyes forget about it so then I did something now when you get Mar just like my grandfather Pao Garcia would say we don't get married in the spirit we get married in the flesh and I knew that brother brandham said look character I knew that but then came came into me it was already there F love entered into me and that love is an intellectual love so what do you think I did without them realizing they were there in front of the the pastor's house 30 or 40 people they were going to take pictures or something like that so then I saw the scene there the young men and the and the the young ladies and and so I I drew Drew closer and I noticed that the the girl that brother Bernie told me her she was there and she she she didn't realize that nobody knew that I did it in my in my mischievous mind I'm not gonna go just because brother Bernie told me I have to like her you understand that how are you going to marry somebody that you don't like sneaky sneaky so I got really close just to check her her out tell you the truth it was just to see if she was pretty or if she was ugly and when I saw her like oh my God she's the one she's pretty I liked her and no now what I did I I I went ahead a little bit I thought what am I going to do when when I'm 10 or 15 years of marriage and you already know that there's disappointments in marriage one fails the other you know and one day my wife's going to get mad at me and I thought about this and I said what am I going to do when she's Johnny Johnny joh John joh when she's in my face telling me stuff or telling me something upset can you imagine upset though you're your wife with upset at you and then ugly m now my wife she's a Christian very very strict she's she's she's a rule rule of law and she got to that point she told me there in my face you're here you're wrong there and and I'm there listening to her and what do you think I thought I said it one day I've done it one or two or three times your wife's never gotten mad at you right no never gets mad at the wife right no noos [Laughter] Liars so then when she's really upset and this and that and the other what do you think I said remember I'm I'm a Pisces mad and she's telling me and I tell her l oh what a pretty face you have and then she and then it seems like she liked it for a second but then no I'm still mad at you I thought about that can you imagine the woman upset and then all ugly I'd rather get divorced okay feel your love now I'm feel you perver is perverted okay why I haven't even read my scriptures man I'm bad AAP love no beginning or no End Circle has a beginning and has an end you get married with a very beautiful woman in 30 or 40 years all of that beauty will be finished everything comes to an end the man really muscular 30 or 40 years later without teeth even even their their nose all ugly ugly hairs the brother says F sir [Laughter] look not everybody look handsome brother brandom says a beautiful woman if she's not careful she's an instrument to send men to Hell she's a curse A man also if he doesn't take care you should be faithful to his wife she should be faithful to her husband thou you should be faith for eternity I don't believe in divorce Hallelujah now in f love everything comes to an end four or three don't be a dictator we should pray for our children is that right everything under fio no it's it's vulnerable it's not in it's not infallible it can fail everything based on Love Can fail oh I got married to my husband he's a worker hard work he's veryt ENT he's very clean all that and all of a sudden he he what's wrong with him now I even have to take care of him because everything comes to an end brother everything comes to an end under Love Now a mother's love to a child is perverted now I know that there's a balance there is that right do you understood me we should pray for our children let it be a revelation and a conviction unto them so then you don't have to force anyone okay now I'm going to read the scripture see if you can follow me here Ephesians 5:23 ephes for the for the husband is the head of the house head of the of your wife that's our absolute Genesis 3:16 and unto the woman he said I will greatly multiply thy sorrow and in thy conception in thy sorrow Thou shalt bring forth children and thy desires shall be to thy husband and he shall rule over thee the Bible says that the man shall rule over the okay you know when God made Adam and Eve and made him when he first created him he spoke the word he made him in theop form and they were coequal did you know that Lucifer was co-equal to God at one time but because of his Beauty lifted up got lifted up and then God kicked him out okay now when God made Eve in flesh and when she sinned and when she did what she did now she is no more equal with Adam now she's on another level now she must be subject to Adam now Adam is her ruler right how many can say Amen to that okay not too many hands okay okay Matthews 10:37 he that loveth father or mother more than me is not worthy of me he that loveth son and daughter more than me is not worthy of me because because Mother's Love son's love uncle niece cousin it's all filo love you got to get out of that going a higher level and have a love because in the within the families and you know what I'm talking about who hasn't disappointed you sometime or another your uncle your sister or your brother or your sister in your flesh and and and you can't get out of that Circle and you can't forgive them because they they sinned or did something wrong against you in the flesh in your love and in your love you cannot forgive the other person you got to get out of that have a for whoever loves mother and father brother sister son more than me is not worthy of me we got to have the love of God okay now man I don't know if I should read this quote it just uh we got 22 minutes I hope I can I'll read it now we've tried dictators it doesn't work and each one seems to get just a little bit shallower each time and now we stand at the great moment when Anything could happen it could be over in five minutes that every nation would be laid to powder and if we're at that time where ought the church to be the great crisis the great crisis is on right now then also we have the home life crisis it seemed like the home life is running out into shallow Waters it used to be that the home that the Father the head of the house would sit down in the morning and he would speak with his family and they would all take all the the the old Family Bible and just read a little bit and all together around the table and have prayer you don't see that no more and when the day was done mom had the dishes they had all gathered in and read some more of the Bible before going to bed now I had to just get that out of the way now see I got about 20 minutes left that's why I need to continue next week if God permits okay now I'm going to say something here that uh wow it's well who are you to say that you can't you can't say nothing brother Johnny well let me explain it the best of my ability in Mexico okay I got nothing against Mexico I love Mexican people I'm a Mexican born here so what does that make me Mexican ameran some people call me poo I'm poo Mexican blood born here get it okay so it might make me AO now the next statement you're going to say brother John you don't have a right to talk about that remember I don't base things on your thought or my thought the word of God the message of the hour in Mexico in they have a certain not everybody but the general okay and this has been known for years in Mexico I don't know about the rest of the countries but Mexico is more famous they have what they call the Macho spirit is that right because the man Manda is the boss the man is the boss in if the woman doesn't like it I'll kick her around a little bit smack a little bit and she knows here that I'm the boss I'm the I'm the D in Mexico in Mexico that's one side of the coin on the other side of the coin in America in America United States of America here it's not the spirit of Macho here in the United States the women are the [Music] boss they even wear the pants see or no yes or no this is going to rub a little bit oh brother you don't have a right you can't balance it because you're from here for me that one's wrong in Mexico in Mexico and the spirit of the United States is also wrong you know why because the woman is he's a I've seen brothers and sisters that when the man is speaking huh yes my love whatever you say you're not going to make it in the Rapture you might make it as the foolish version you understand what I just said that's what we have here in this church just like many churches because the spirit over there is is being Macho but in America even men wear we you know about a man that wears aalto that's a you know that there's ministers on the pulpit that are a minist ministers s sister s ministers Min in you know why because they compromise with something for money because of Fame because of the interest or for a reason okay I can't criticize this because they're going to be offended they're going to pull the strings over here TI on any strings of nobody we have to be anchored and that anchor is the word of God and the word of God it cuts going in and coming out if I'm here tell me they're going to cut you off cut them cut them off if I stand God's going to back me up because I stand on the word I'm not standing on man I don't trust in man Every Man Has disappointed me sister he me I can guarantee I guarantee you sister that he's going to disappoint you and I Chris Chris she's going to disappoint guaranteed can you imagine he's a young man I've been married for 40 years imagine how many times I haven't disappointed my wife many times amen because it's F love it's a perverted love first of all it's already messed up just to begin a man is married to a woman oh she's very pretty oh she's she's a good cook and one day what if something happens that she can't cook no more I got married to her because she was a good cook now even I have to cook she can't make any food for me oh what oh Lord why did you place me in this situation because we're working with f love love is perverted did you understand rather than it's [Music] perverted conf no say if if I brother Johnny talk with day Johnny I can guarantee you if I if I live with him for a year in a Year brother F I don't even want to talk to him anymore he's horrible it's got this bad habit he has this bad habit he's like this he's like that no that right yes but also him bad habits we all have bad habits I'm not afraid to say itren your wife she's got bad habits and you know which on and you know what I'm talking about yes sir wife has bad habits and even even dirty habit turn it around the other way you brother you have bad habits horrible habits there you're big monsters so what are we going to do everything's a disappointment this say it again this nation is a disappointment now they say we're going to elect a Woman for president there might be a woman president possibly brother BR said this I predict before 1977 that a great woman will rise and it could be the Catholic church that's already been fulfilled that woman is already seated in the White House no Clinton no not Clinton she might be president but the system of Jezebel that the woman is the boss on the throne at the white house because it's a spirit that dominates this country the woman is the boss wow but I hope you don't hate me brother sisters I hope you don't hate me sisters I love everyone here as far as I know I love everybody now M Spirit and the Spirit the woman is the boss now what do you base your stand on well on my credentials well what are your credentials I'll read it to you what brother Brown said but the only credential that a Believer has is the word of God living in him declaring Jesus Christ in that person that's a separated Nazarite unto the Lord separated for the word sake the Bible's sake so my credentials is I had a Nazarite call I am not I am not an American I am not a Mexican I am not I am a Nazarite every sister sister that has long hair that's a Nazarite right the prophets were nazarites Jesus was a Nazarite Samson was a Nazarite and every born again Christian baptized with the Holy Ghost he's a Nazarite so I'm not a Mexican I'm not AO brother what are you talking about oh you're just wrong look brother in my flesh I'm a Mexican I eat Mexican food but I was born here and I really like hamburgers so then I got an Amer American Spirit okay but that's the Flesh in my flesh I'm an American I'm a Mexican that's my flesh but in my soul in my soul I am a Nazarite in my credentials is the word of the Living God declaring to Jesus Christ that he lives in us I'm quoting brother bam I believe tonight that every man and woman that's ever and every boy and girl that's born of the spirit of God is a Nazarite unto the Lord are you with me are you a Nazarite huh we're Nazarite or do we go with the American Spirit do we go to do we go to movies well let's all be gays here oh say that again let's all be gays here let's all let's be's be let's the American Spirit that's the spirit of the devil Spirit of antichrist I'm not an American when it comes to that even brother bramon he was American right in his flesh but not in his soul there is a super race made up of Mexican whites Germans Swedish Brazilians the Chile the Chile from Chile in Japan wherever of all different colors a super race nazarites [Applause] naos that believe in Malachi 45 because they have separated them them things themselves from the cares of the world and whatever the world has has to say so a Nazarite is one who separates himself from the world you're not of this world little children neither am I of this world I pray for you Jesus prayed for his church they would not be of the world they are not of the world I don't care you're not American you're not Swedish you're not European you're a Christian so being a Christian and my bases in the word of God I declare repeat what the prophet of God said the the man that's the boss of his wife because Mach it's of the devil and a man that lets his wife be the boss of him is did you understand me now you know why I have to I have to continue if God permits me okay I don't that if you're a Christian your spirit is from up there so it makes you live a holy want to be holy want to act like Christ act like God your whole desire is heaven and not of the world okay so back to the drawing board three minutes brother sister when you're disappointed with your wife or he's disappointed with her husband there's no answer there's no solution there's no no how do we fix this problem you canot fix the problem you cannot fix oh yeah brother to a certain point you can you know with mother with a with a little grandkid you know mother you know brother R said when a little girl hangs around Grandma a lot do they go together what is that love that's not AAP love that's love okay do they go together a little girl and grandma do they go together brother bam said Grandma's probably got some candy somewhere they unit them together because when that little girl grows up she gonna think oh Grandma she's old and fogy she's out of date you know how it is in New Generation everyone their little all the little kids running around their little iPad thing that can you imagine what a bunch of neurotics we're at the end of the world brother everything's finished everything's been a deception disappointment so then if there's no solution in F have to get out of that Circle and enter into that agapo love Circle and only the bride will do it why do you think that sister Bram that she slammed the door in brother brhom why it was fio love it wasn't God's love have love and what happened God got out of out of that problem that she had but how did she he take her out by the spoken word because of that third pool I believe this it's the the the bride and and the foolish virgin the bride and the foolish virgin and what are you going to do when it's bride against bride oh no no oh that that that doesn't exist brother oh no oh no brother brandham and sister Bram they're both of the Bride brother but tell me something biblical but of course do you remember Paul bride and what did Paul do remember that he's bride in the first Age and what did he do when he found Jesus Pao Pao Pao Saul Saul Saul Saul why persecutest thou me for it is hard for you to kick against the prick SE Paul was persecuting seed Ste Steven oh no is or is that right Paul didn't didn't Paul kill kill that dog and they killed him they killed him but how brother how how that be now if you saw that scene didn't have mercy forgiveness nothing was a was a murderer God forew him before the foundation seed of God you remember that man when David he said how am I going to fight up there in the front my king and me in front of in front in front of the of the army David had already taken his woman he was already a liar he was a murderer send him home let him go let him go to is that right can he refused to enter in with her can you imagine on that day how faithful faithful that man was unto David and even though David disappointed him even his Pastor no your pastor disappoint you because he's human I can disappoint you what it's going to be a root of is it there is it going going to be there no sir you have to get out of that the bride forgives everything it doesn't matter what comes what you suffer she is positive brother they oh brother no we need is be kicked around now look for a Christian what is it what's going to happen oh Victory where are we going we're going to a better land peace tranquility I know that my time's up I'm going to read this quote remember friends if you're black white yellow red American Canadian Russian Spanish Mexico wherever you're from you're all one in Christ Jesus everyone stand up please amen amen God is coming for a bride it's a washing of the Water by the word of God is what's honing us cutting us who is the head of the home the woman no sir man is the head not the boss or a dictator he has to have the spirit of [Music] Christ let us bow our heads father thank you Lord for what I you've permitted me to say so far God this message just burns in me Lord Jes I don't have a message it's the word of God it's the message that the prophet brought to us and I do not believe like they say now that the bride has the voice that she is the voice of God for this it has its place they need to rephrase that brother Bram said I am your voice I am the head and she only Echo repeats what the prophet of God said because she knows her place and she recognizes Who the head is of the [Applause] I hope people understand me Lord Jesus I'm not against anybody I love everybody but the word of God cuts and the word of God separates because every from the beginning you said let there be light and the water and the land separated and brother brandham said God calls for a total separation from sin and someday there will be a Rapture and God will separate he will do it he will do it separate the bride into the Rapture God help us to line up with your word circumcise our hearts clean our Spirits our minds not be nothing defiled in us we line up with your word we want to be Miss Jesus Miss Jesus oh God I know I'm responsible that's why I'm saying what I'm saying because someday I'm going to be judged for every word that I'm saying now may I be found worthy to stand on your word in the name of the Lord Jesus [Music] Christ can you say Amen you may
