[Music] with me [Music] god bless you is great to see each and every one of you tonight as it would be here for our children's service it's it's a privilege to be able to bring to you the next installment from the series of books entitled supernatural to life of William Branham we're in book three the man in his commissioned 1946 to 1950 before we get started with tonight's excerpt just want to let you know that earlier this week many in the world celebrated the assassination of a civil rights leader those of us in the message however know this week to be the 109th anniversary of our prophet's birth and we're so thankful for that that happened that would have been two days ago and I don't know how long 109 years is but I can tell you how long it is at least since I can remember being living and I know that's a long time and we're very thankful that his birth occurred on April 6th 1909 in a small cabin in rural Kentucky we pick up the story as we're in the year 1946 this is a period of time where the charismatic revival was in full swing and brother Branham was right in the center of it we he has had several miraculous meetings word has gotten around of the amazing testimonies that brothers and sisters at attended these meetings have seen these healings were telling the world we'll pick up the story at the end of chapter 32 challenging insanity and then we'll start and read a portion of chapter 33 entitled a prayer line eight days long the next morning sunlight pried open Bill's eyes he turned his head on his pillow to look out the hotel window and was startled to see a woman sitting next to his bed his gray her gray hair was pulled tightly back in a bun and she wore a light brown suit with a white waist she was not watching him but was staring sideways at the wall so that he could see her profile she looked sad flustered bill thought how did that woman get in my room the door is locked and here's the key laying on the nightstand lifting himself up on his elbows he said quizzically madam then bill saw a man sitting by the wall just beyond the woman he was a tall grey headed man wearing a light brown suit and sporting a bright red tie he also looked sad the woman turned her head to look at the man and the two of them smiled at one another what's this thought bill he signed up fully in bed when he did he suddenly was no longer lying in bed at all but was standing on a platform in a church that he didn't recognize he bit down hard on his finger to check if he was dreaming the paint assured him that he was wide awake then he knew it was a vision the church faded and bill was back in bed he watched the gray-haired man and woman they smiled at him nodded their heads and seemed to chuck lists though now they were happy then they both thinned into nothingness shutting his eyes bill whispered god I don't understand this so please show me what it means he suspected that these two people would show up in the prayer line that night it had happened several times before he would see a vision of a person before the service then later that night when he recognized the person coming through the prayer line he would know that God was going to do something special in that person's life usually a vision of this type showed bill exactly what was going to take place in the prayer service this vision on the other hand had ended as a mystery taking his Bible off the nightstand Lord where will you have me read your word this morning then he opened his Bible at random the pages split at 2nd Kings chapter 20 bill read where the Lord sent the prophet Isaiah to King ezekiah to tell him his time had come his illness would kill him King Hezekiah turned his face to the wall and prayed fervently for more time the Lord heard ezekias prayer and spoke to Isaiah saying go tell my servant Ezekiel that I will grant him 15 more years at that moment the phone rang bill picked it up thinking it must be pastor Brown instead it turned out to be mr. Kenny from Memphis this case had completely slipped Bill's mind but now he remembered well brother Kenny what kind of news have you got for me mr. Kenny's voice sagged with heaviness brother Branham we sign up with him all night he's about to leave us any minute now tell me brother Kenny does mr. D ever wear a light brown suit in a bright red tie why yes he dresses that way all the time why and does mr. D ever wear a light brown suit with a white waist mrs. D excuse me she's wearing that dress right now how do you know brother Branham do you do you know them yes tell mr. D to come to the phone mr. Kenney hesitated I already told her what she said I want to talk to her bill insisted soon a shaky distraught woman's voice came on the line bill said sister D thus saith the Lord your husband shall live do you believe that mrs. D didn't answer bill could hear some kind of commotion in the background then mr. Kinney was back on the phone what did you say to her brother branham the woman fainted I said her husband is going to live I was describing him because I saw him in a vision a few moments ago I'm flying over to Memphis on the next plane meet me at the airport when bill got to the hospital in Memphis mrs. knees sister met him in the hall she was all huffy and displeased sassing the very idea a Holy Roller preacher here to pray for my dying brother I think it's a disgrace bill walked on by thinking Satan ken can't send enough Devils out of hell to stop it now it's done because it's dust saith the Lord he met a nurse coming out of the room are there any doctors or nurses in there yes she said there are two doctors please ask them to leave the doctors left looking very sour bill instantly recognized the man languishing inside the oxygen tent is the same one he had seen in division that morning mister D lay on his back staring straight up with murky unflinching eyes bill reached through the oxygen tent and took hold the man's hand his own hand swelled to the rhythmic pounding up the pneumonias vibrations brother D can you hear me mrs. D said my husband has been unconscious for two days brother branham bill looked at the elderly woman she to look exactly like he had seen her in the vision you don't doubt anything that I've said to you do know I don't turning his attention back to the dying man bill prayed dear God I know that these are the people I saw this morning in a vision now in the name of Jesus Christ please heal this man even with his eyes closed he knew the suam was going down in his hand because the throbbing stopped then bill felt the man grip his hand they'll open his eyes to see mister D morning his lips with his tongue mrs. D stood at the foot of the bed where the eyes closed still praying bill said mister D do you know me the man cocked his head slightly and said yes your brother branham now his wife jerked up her head in astonishment then when the reality struck her she dove into the oxygen tent yelling dad dad showering him with hugs and kisses without another word bill slipped out of the room and caught the next plane back to Little Rock two days later mr. D ate ham and eggs for breakfast and left the hospital in another day he was back at his post master job overseeing the local mail for the rest of the summer into the fall of 1946 william branham preached throughout arkansas without a break because each meeting was a billboard for the next meeting the crowds grew larger and prayer lines longer at every stop bill pushed himself every night praying for the sick until one two and sometimes three o'clock in the morning he felt a driving compulsion to make up for lost time to somehow make amends for the mistake he had made ten years earlier when God had called him to step out into evangelism and he had refused even though he was in superb fiscal shape from his many years of walking the backwoods inspecting power lines still the constant effort and lack of sleep took a heavy toll in his body he was simply wearing himself out it might have been different if during today he could have slept as long as he needed to regain his energy but that seldom happened there always seemed to be some special need that bill could not bring himself to refuse like the time bill was preaching for pastor Johnson at Corning Arkansas after closing the service at 3 o'clock in the morning bill collapsed into bed at the parsonage next door thoroughly exhausted a few hours later the ringing telephone roused him he heard mrs. Johnson saying we can't get him up sir we just got him to bed evidently the party on the other end of the line was persistent finally bill stumbled out into the living room and said grudgingly let me talk to him hello brother branham my name is Paul Morgan said the man in a tired but determined voice I'm the county clerk here at Walnut Ridge which is about 70 miles from where you are my 12 year old daughter is dying with pneumonia won't you please come and pray for her the telephone sat near a window letting Bill see outside the day looked overcast a steady drizzle of rain fell on maybe a hundred people huddled in small group groups on the lawn bill knew they were waiting to see him mr. Morgan I would be glad to come if I could but looky here there are mothers standing outside right now waiting for me to pray for their babies they've been standing there all night in the rain how can I leave them to come pray for your daughter I appreciate that said mr. Morgan but those mothers don't have babies that are dying the best specialist I can get say that my daughter can only live about three more hours brother branham she's my only child please come and pray for her thinking back on the death of his own Sharon Rose bill said I'll be there as soon as I can when he hung up pastor Johnson protested brother Branham you can't go down there you're just about dead I'll try to sleep in the back seat on the way Reverend Johnson sped down to wet road at 70 miles an hour while bill lay in the backseat fidgeting in and out of sleep he could not get comfortable his eyes hurt in his head ain't sittin up bill laid his head against the window suddenly his skin tingling and he felt pressure on his eardrums increase then he saw the angel of the Lord sitting next to him on the back seat snapping wide awake bill sucked in his breath as has widened in his muscles stiffened with fear just above the angel circled that supernatural light or more correctly part of that light for it circled right through the roof of the car half in and half out as usual the angel had his arms folded and looked at bill sternly when he spoke the angels voice sounded warm and reassuring say to Paul Morgan thus saith the Lord as soon as the angel finished his instructions he vanished at the hospital bill saw something he had never seen before rather than use an oxygen tent the nurse stood by the bend and periodically put a rubber mask over the girls nose which forced oxygen into her lungs each time the oxygen came on the girl would take a few short shallow laboured breaths the nurse said I'll have to keep this oxygen going it's the only way we can keep her alive she's not breathing on her own mr. Morgan put his arms around bill and sobbed a brother branham I've tried to live right I don't know why God is taking my little girl from me don't get excited brother Morgan bill said reassuringly don't fear I have a word for you from the Lord first I'll pray for your daughter laying his hand on the girl bill asked for her healing in the name of Jesus Christ the nurse started to put the rubber mask over the patient's nose again bill put out his hand and stopped her anxious seconds passed then the girl took us wash our breath on her own the nurse looked at bill questioningly bill motion for her to wait the girl took another breath on her own and then another the auction mask was no longer needed ille turned to the parents many specialists have announced your daughter is dying but thus saith the Lord mr. Morgan your daughter shall recover and here is your word from the Lord remember this all the days of your life the waters are running clear ahead even though bill didn't get any rest before the evening service began he still felt daytime excursions like this one were worthwhile because three days from then Paul Morgan's daughter was well enough to return to school god bless [Applause] [Music] and my Savior bling and day I die [Music] me [Music] Deebo [Music] Oh the [Music] I [Music] the day [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] first [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] I [Music] [Applause] praise the Lord Amen lobos's Senor amen can you please stand with me simply open the cell appear conmigo amen welcome to children's church once again get me needles I said vco2 ninos if you could turn around and just greet your neighbor with a smile and say welcome then I will have you need us to be signals a man it's good to see each and every one of you this morning is movie went over calendar ustedes is that out of it not this morning this afternoon hasta manana is the batter how many of you enjoy that special amen there's a special I always I love at cross a meme encanta el canto in la cruz i know that as a young man growing up sake a common joven creciendo i was used to hear my pastor sing that song mia customerís impress couch and my pastor can't are a second Tony used to come in and speak quando in di e of lava you know I heard I heard I heard I heard something interesting as I was listening to one of his tapes this week yo escucha algo muy interesante mientras escucha Vanessa Cintas estas a man how many of you know that our pastor made tapes where you can hear him speak amen cuantos ami que nuestra Pastore so centas para que podamos escuchar lo and I must have been in this tape I must have been sitting in the front yo Cisco Chavez the simple kiss-ass estas and allahi al frente cuz he asked he asked me my primo and then he asked one of the Deacon brothers eaters place I don't know they lost the IKONOS if brother if brother Vega si la mano Vega had had earphones on the NIA ld4 knows he said because he wanted his young people to hear what he was saying por que dijo que quería que los jovenes escuchar and lo que él estaba decian i was 1991 runner jacques-louis of way and we know asientos noventa you know such 27 years ago can you believe that kasi binti siete Ocho atras prelude so that's that's why he has children's church -

rebuilding exactly is that correct so basically get your life together right okay I'm sorry I didn't mean to well that's okay we're gonna cut for a commercial break can you give them a round of applause and we'll be back after a word from our sponsors [Applause] [Music] no man I see some family issues this it smells like G chato and if you ask me so I think we're gonna go ahead and ask Hamma bacon her side of the story okay yeah she seems to be the reasonable one right but it's looking like so far we have we we have like there's some issues that I just can't I can put my fingers on you yeah we have one that just doesn't care about anything right we have one that seems like he cares too much but not about the important things exactly I'm really interested to see what hammer well hammer has okay and we're back and three two one welcome back before the break we had our beautiful bacon family here crispy bacon fake bacon and ham I love bacon here we are at the sunday talk where we don't just talk well we why don't walk now we were right about to hear a word from this hammer bacon can you explain your side of the story please please Ellis well yes I I am very very happy to do that um well you know I I love my brothers very very very much and um you know when Big Bad came through the neighborhood lobster and well I mean they chose to build their houses on foundations that just couldn't hold up I did the Christianly sisterly thing and I but I'm not the bad person they paid me out to be the reason crispy has to sleep on the couch was because bacon bacon moved all his shoes into the third bedroom in the box that point Krispy was ticked off so he wouldn't sleep in the bedroom anyway cuz the shoes were in there first so I want to help my brothers but it's so hard puttin up with them so so I'm hearing something here first of all that's a beautiful accent you got there yes he's not pork ish mark sign is it pork and cheese it's okay awesome that's what I thought well second of all I hear that I hear that you want to help your brothers right she's willing to help them rebuild but she's not willing just to waste her time unless they have a solid foundation now that seems that reasonable exactly I think we're gonna yeah let's see what our audience has to say let's see what our audience has to say do we have any any questions for any of our porkers here yeah anybody has a question you have a question for one of them Oh wonderful here you go sir come on can we give him a round of applause please thank you that's a big annual look my answer to the to the little itty-bitty piggy okay um is that you know what look I got an inheritance and so I don't have to work but unlike my sister over here she spent it on a foundation or something ha but I mean come on I look really good I mean come on look your jacket doesn't even match her pants he stole my shoe and look what he's wearing shoes they look like they've been in a box look look look look you do not

okay thank you you look fine that is some hostile Pig is that his the hostile Pig okay Oh any other questions feel threatened look at yes um sister way in the back do you have a question yeah would you like to share that with us mr. Chris I just told you guys you're not a very good listener today I just told you I'm a youtuber I have like 43 followers what do you got so follow him exactly so no strangers anyways like I try to make money youtubing and I you know I work really hard at it like for example the other day like I got up really early to start my like even before she came home for lunch so I live already up crispy so so you're saying you got up during lunch time and that's really row before lunchtime thank you get it right yeah I'm sorry it sounds like you want like for something you're supposed to do you're supposed to wake up before lunchtime exactly it's like saying I take care of my kids you're supposed to take care of your kids well I know you don't have kids and I can see that you can't afford them right now your lavish lifestyle and youtubing habits have got you where you are and that's why we're here to talk about this thank you for listening thanks ok well it's because that I'm not like this guy over here because I mean it's straws right uh-huh nice it looks beautiful some of us would like to I want to live there so I could see sure I could see the fakin he has a lot with your ha he's really considering his image so he really cares about aesthetics he wants to look good I was a beautiful deal even with all the effort that you put in looking good there was still not a solid foundation look bricks is just it takes too much work I don't want to get dirty I mean brown mud does not go good with this outfit come on let me ask you a question so building a house with bricks is too much work so when your house falls down you run to the person who did all the work to put that house up now how piggish least selfish is that what do you mean how big oh whoa whoa whoa don't get your pigtail all in the bunch she's my sister she's our sister she's supposed to be able to have her job literally like you what do you mean it's her job after job like hello like when not when I need

of crazy right now what do you mean are you getting crazy like are you supposed to help me or not say you're not say you're not see exactly freeze let me say it crispy like seriously are you okay do

say but then when push comes to shove you won't lay the foundation I want to help my brothers I'm willing to help them yes but I won't help them keep on building stick and stroll houses thank you can you give her a round of applause go what I hear mr. say they say you're willing to help your brothers and you've done a great job at building on a foundation boys you have a young pig who is willing to help you she's willing to help you get on the right hoof if you would just let her help you build that foundation there's so much truth into that now let me say I appreciate how you've went ahead and physically laid the right foundations at home yeah that's beautiful yeah but I think dr. du and I would both agree that there's also another foundation that's even more important than a physical foundation and I think is the underlying issue for all of the problems that I said this family oh yes I see you're fighting each other you're getting your pork chops all chopped up like you need to just sit down and listen to the solution cuz we can talk how many could agree with the round of applause we can talk about problems for us forever about problems for hours but we just want to spend five minutes talking about the solution exactly and the solution is Jesus Christ amen he is the foundation the foundation the solid rock to everything now I have a scripture for you I'm gonna ask a brave little little piggie to read the scripture who would be volunteer that knows how to read that one of you guys want to read for me who wants to read Elijah did you raise your hand come read for me can you come grab this microphone I want you to hear the words of Jesus that speaks about the solid foundation and mr. mr. Bacon's both of you miss bacon if you would please listen to this and take this to your little piggy heart [Music] anyone who listens to my teaching and it is wise like a person who builds a house and they sell that walk that dock the weighing comes in the hominy and the floor waters wise and the wind beats against the house it will not come [Music] collapse because it is built on bedrock but anyone who hears my teachings and does not does follow oh obey is like a foolish like a person who built house upon the sand when the rain and flood comes but the winds will be against the house that house it will collapse with a mighty crash amen can you give him a round of applause there was some hard words in there oh yeah so basically we need to build upon a solid foundation because when that big bad wolf comes it starts glowing stars line is your foundation stable he starts howling and Javier offing is your foundation stable so think about it think about that what is your biggest fear what is stopping you because I need you to know that the only person standing in the way of you and having complete success spiritually and physically is your own little piggy self so what is your biggest fear what is keeping you from this crispy you gotta face it well I I guess if I had to be really honest with myself my biggest fear and my biggest worry is that I [Music] really don't know how to do anything like literally I have zero skills and like if I have to make a foundation or if I have to have a foundation and then build upon that foundation I can't do that by myself because I literally can't do anything by myself hmm thank you for being so honest thank you yeah that was very brave but you know what you might feel under-qualified but Jesus Christ does not call the qualified he qualifies who he calls I'm not a little piggy hey little piggy how are you doing mommy piggy if you want you to go ahead and take her to the back and then come back you no problem everybody say your prayers for the baby piggy but thank you thank you for being honest they are faking faking please sure I guess my my biggest problem is yes yes playing both sides of the fence I mean it's it's really hard cuz I I know I know some storms are gonna come and I and I know it's gonna be tough can anybody relate to that and I mean it's it's just so easy to lean on my sister I mean she's always been the responsible one you know and I mean I guess you know some yeah me and crispy fight a little bit but it's always fun you know I never scuffle hoof or nothing but you know it whenever it does get tough I lean on her and and I guess I never realized that she might get annoyed by it or what that is understandable and sometimes we sweet scuff hooks with our brothers and our sisters and it's not gonna be a walk in the park but love is more than just some feeling that we feel love it isn't is a decision so and so is building on the right foundation just if you don't start building on the right foundation which is Jesus Christ you can't even love because love is God how could you even know God how could you even know love if you don't know him so like I said this isn't an issue about squabbling this is an issue about resentment this isn't even an issue about your parents I know you feel really really bad since your dad got turned into some sausage links and you weren't able to make it right some of the things that you said that's okay Jesus Christ today wants to help you lay the foundation for the rest of your life if you would be willing and the choice is yours are you willing can we give them someone courage can you give them a hand of a round of applause are you willing bacon so the first thing I mean I'm willing yeah I just I know it's gonna be hard miss hammer are you willing cuz you did a great job laying your physical foundation yeah but you have to also understand your trials they come because you're a daughter of God you can't just kick your trials out of your house you have to accept what God has for you cuz that is going to mold you if we be picky if we worth picking if we kick everybody out of our house we'll be by ourselves but God has our family there to mold us to teach us how to love to teach us how to be patient to teach us how to be kind so you need to carry on that spirit of Christ amen I thank you and so we want to lay that foundation for you as well would you be willing yes so all you have to do is raise up your little hoof and we're gonna say a simple prayer yeah okay Lord Jesus you know what doctor do I've done a lot of saying can you please leave them in a simple prayer to accept the Lord Jesus Christ in their heart we're sure well thank you sir our beloved Lord Jesus we present before you the bacon family Lord and now Lord they're in a perfect situation Lord to where they have recognized their mistakes and that they have made really bad choices Lord but now that come before your throne of grace and mercy yes and they want to make things right before you Lord they want to arrange their family life please don't comfort their hearts Lord we know they have lost their father Lord but they still have each other your father and even if the trials and tribulation comes there are still brothers and sisters who stand before them Lord and show them the right way and show them that you are the only foundation help now our brother krispies and our brother fakin so that they can become real Christian piggies Lord and we pray and we put your hands and give our sister hammer more patience with them in the name of her Lord Jesus amen amen [Music] so just like that you confess with your lips that Jesus Christ is Lord you repent and you be baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and you will receive the gift of the Holy Ghost amen would you like that does that sound good so now that we've laid that foundation sister hammer has already agreed to help you lay your brick foundation of your
