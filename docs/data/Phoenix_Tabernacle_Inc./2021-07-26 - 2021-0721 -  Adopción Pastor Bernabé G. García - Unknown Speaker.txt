introduction of the series of messages of adoption this message was preached on august 22nd of the year 1976 is the reading and the feeling of the word amen if foreign be ye are in heaviness through many full temptations that the trial of your faith being much more precious than of gold that perishes though it be tried with fire might be found unto praise and honor and glory of the appearing of jesus christ [Music] amen welcome each and every one of you tonight [Music] i'm happy that our sister is here with us tonight [Music] i want each and every one of you to feel loose and free and lower tonight [Music] this morning we took uh a very long time in the sermon it was here for knowledge and in reality i didn't get time to finish the sermon i just closed the sermon because i could see that the people were firing very much because of the heat and tonight i'm going to be very short in what i'm going to speak my whatever was either [Music] so the subject i'm going to speak on tonight is adoption it is going to be at the beginning of a series of sermons by the name of adoption and congruent in conjunction with this scene that we're going to speak tonight we're going to take the recognizing your position now i want everyone to uh watch yourselves tonight every thought that i am speaking on i want you to know note it down and write it down in your mind and in your heart the thing that we desire most is to be adopted all christianity speaks of adoptions we know that there comes to being in the resurrection we may be found there we have to know what everything that brother bran spoke on adoption speaking a little bit on every verse we have read first peter first chapter six and seventh verse now considered [Music] you cannot be raptured except first you recognize your position after you recognize your position then you have after you have said your faith has to be tried no notice here on earth according to the position that you have that will be your faith and you must be tried according to your positions you won't be tried for the position that someone else may hold for el santa because he has another faith different than yours do you notice immediately examined you notice right away that you can't examine yourself by examining somebody else [Music] because the position of that person is [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] that the heir as long as he's a child delivers differs nothing from a servant so he be lord of all god even so we when we were children were in bondage under the elements of the world but when the fullness of the time was come god sent forth a son made of a woman made under the law beyond to redeem that they were under the law that we might receive the adoptions adoption of sons [Music] and because your son god has sent forth the spirit of the son into your hearts crime of the father our you begin to receive instructions to prepare you for the adoption when a child is born [Music] [Music] [Music] to follow spiritually [Music] we have to recognize that it is a voice of god speaking and when he does call us he begins to instruct us to it is necessary to follow every instruction [Music] people like to hear we're going to be adopted in [Music] now we see that the scripture speaks [Music] just like our children when they were born [Music] [Music] [Music] then it is time to start [Music] [Music] himself in a way that he knows how to lead himself so is it in the spirit um [Music] um [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] the [Music] because the instructions of the bible are not followed of the father [Music] thought como there is how it should work [Music] it is not because of lack of instruction it is necessary to teach young people have to have a heart to work before they want to get married [Music] after [Music] is [Music] give her all of utmost importance that you have instructions on occasions we have might have 10 years in the message i'm not referring to the churches i'm referring to ourselves yes i know we have 10 years still doesn't know how [Music] she doesn't know how to act it's a monster tylenol for another animal so that we is woman now the man also has his instructions now we're going to reverse the situation because but now he doesn't have a job it is necessary fifth chapter i only gave two or three illustrations uh it's like the young people saying [Music] a bunch of people that are undressed properly they're talking about i'm spiritually speaking now now we have the instructions that's the prophet [Music] [Music] [Music] determination [Music] the people don't want to hear [Music] faithful second and third verse [Music] not only so but we glory in tribulations also knowing that tribulation orchestrations [Music] and patients experience [Music] because the love of god is shared abroad in our hearts for the holy ghost which is given to us what i'm telling you tonight is what has structured from the from the scriptures that is the reason many people do not have patience [Music] [Music] is [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] so [Music] it is a true story [Music] that in every service he would get up to testify and he would ask for mercy it is
