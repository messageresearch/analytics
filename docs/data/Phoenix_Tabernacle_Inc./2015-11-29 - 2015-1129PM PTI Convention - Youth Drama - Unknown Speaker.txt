TRANSCRIPT
========================================
[Music] Hey you are you are you are you are Heat. [Music] Heat. Heat. Heat. [Music] Amen. God bless you. It's good to be in the house of the Lord. Amen. If you would just please stand with me. If you could just turn around and greet your neighbor and tell them, "Welcome to the house of the Lord." Say, "Welcome. Welcome to Children's Church." Amen. [Music] Amen. God is good and all the time. God is good. Amen. And so we're happy to greet you once again in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ on behalf of our pastor, brother Bernie Garcia Garcia and everybody here at Phoenix Tabernacle Children's [Music] Church. We just welcome you. So we have a special treat for you tonight. Uh it's uh just brothers and sisters and and young people and children that are just going to bring you something special what God has put in their heart. One of the things that be before we get started, uh, I would like for us to consider is what God has done through us. Well, not through us, but through the Lord Jesus Christ for us. And as we have partaken as we have partaken of these services and we've been blessed, I think it's worth noting that it's important that each of us have received what we have come for this weekend. If you feel that you need something and you feel that you haven't received it yet, [Music] he is here tonight. He's been here all along and he's never left your side. He is a God that is merciful. He is a giving God and he loves us. Let us just go to our scripture found in the book of Luke. We're going to go to Luke chapter 6 verse 36 and 37. And the scripture reads like this. Be ye there merciful as your father is also merciful. Judge not, and ye shall not be judged. Condemn not, and ye shall not be condemned. Forgive, and ye shall be forgiven. us that Jesus is the same yesterday, today, and forever. Over 2,000 years ago when he was here healing on earth, Jesus Christ in the flesh and then dying on Calvary for us taking all of our burdens, all of our sin, all of our sickness, making that sacrifice. But what is he doing for us today? Amen. And that's what I want you to think about when you look at the things that you're going to see tonight. What is Jesus doing for me tonight? Let us bow our heads. Loving heavenly father. We love you, Lord Jesus. This evening, we're so thankful, Father, for all of your blessings, Lord. Father, you have just showed us so much love this weekend, Father. Father, we're just humbled by it, Lord. And all we can do is say thank you, Lord, and say that we love you, Lord, and ask you, Father, to just be with us, Father. Live in us, Father. Go in our lives, Lord. our thoughts, Lord. Every step that we take, Father God, may you just be with us. Bless this service, Father. Father, bless our pastor there where he is, Sister Lily. Lord, we love them, Lord. We thank you, Lord. And we love you. And we thank you for the Lord Jesus Christ. Amen. Amen. [Music] God bless you. God bless you. [Music] I set out on a great adventure. The day my father started leading me home. He said there's going to be some mountains to climb and some valleys we're going to go through. But I had no way of knowing just how hard this journey could be. Cuz the valleyies are deeper and the mountains are steeper than I ever would have dreamed. But I know we're going to make it. And I know we're going to get there soon. And I know sometimes it feels like we're going the wrong way, but it's just a long way home. Got some rocks in my shoes and fears I wish I could lose that make the mountain so hard to climb. And my heart gets so heavy with the weight of the world sometimes. And there's a bag of regrets that should have been denied. Yeah, I keep on dragging around. And I can hardly wait for the day I get to let them all down. And I know that day is coming. And I know he's going to be here soon. And I won't turn back. Even if the whole world says I'm going the wrong way, cuz it's just a long way home. [Music] D cuz our God has made a promise. And I know that everything he says is true. And I know wherever we go, he will never leave [Music] us. Cuz it's just a long way home. And I know that day is coming. And I know he's going to be here soon. And I won't turn back. Even if the whole world says I'm going the wrong way, cuz it's just a long way [Music] home. It's just a long way home. [Applause] [Music] When I'm in need, call on the Lord and he helps me. Yes, he hears me. He is faithful and true. won't forget his own. My companion, my best friend, the only true God. There's no one greater, our wonderful savior. Jesus the lion of Judah. Our God is tremendous. His strength never failing. He goes through the fire just to save a sinner. Yes, he is almighty and he sends his angels to guide me. There is no storm too powerful. Our God cannot handle. Our God in simplicity revealed in you and me. Came down from his glory and gave us the victory. The great is of story. When you're in trouble, Jehovani the great and forer the only will fight your battles. Oh yes, he will stand for [Music] you. Your victory will come. Not the way you think it should, but my good Jehovah just loves the paradox to stand in your position and watch the miraculous come into action. Our God is tremendous. His leg never failing. He goes through the fire just to save a sinner. Yes, he is almighty and he sends his angels to guide me. There is no storm too powerful. Our God cannot handle. Our God in simplicity revealed in you and me. Came down from his glory and gave us the victory. The greatest love of story. [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] Wonder Maravig.

You know, if we can get back to a childlike attitude, if we can believe like a little child, the doors of heaven will be open forever. But too many times we get in the way. We allow life. We allow our struggles. We allow our trials. We allow our hardships to limit the power of our God. But like the song says, let's just sing. Oh, [Music] grand me for [Music] more. He [Music] I see.

Ain't God good? Don't he love us? Can we please stand? We want to welcome you once again to our 2015 convention. If you could turn around and and say God bless you to your neighbor with a big smile. On behalf of our our pastor, brother Bernie, we greet you in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and we welcome you to Children's Church. You know, I believe that God have something special for us this evening. How many have received something up until now? You know, I believe that these services have been a blessing. You know, most of us are going to walk out of here different, treasuring something's in our heart. But there's still opportunity for those who haven't accepted the Lord Jesus Christ or made that decision. You know, yesterday was a tremendous service yesterday evening. A lot of people went through the prayer line. God was handing out blessings, giving you the desires of your heart. But as I looked around, there were still a couple of you people, reasoning on what God was doing. Let me tell you something. God is real and he wants to do something in your life. No, he's calling you. do not fight it, he has something for you, more than what you could understand. So if you feel as as the as the service goes on, if you feel the Lord tugging at your heart, just remember the altar's open, he's here to give you the desires of your heart. So once again, we welcome you. We thank the Lord. Okay. For being so good with us. We got a couple of petitions. Our sister uh Rosa Flores, [Music] is that is it say right? Yeah. Ask for prayer for her son Alfredo. He has court tomorrow. Rosio Flores Alfredo. Sister Yatti Diaz. Thanks the Lord for his grace and love and for my healing and my daughter's healing. We have a petition this evening. If you have need this evening, right now it's time to ask the Lord. So, so as we close our eyes, let's everyone close our eyes and be reverent. Bring these needs to the Lord. [Music] Let us pray. Lord heavenly father humbly Lord we approach your throne of mercy as a group of believers Lord believers in your holy word. Believers you sent to prophet believers that you specialize in the impossible. And Lord, to this evening, throughout this weekend, we're so thankful for your blessings, for your Holy Spirit, that guides us, that leads us, shows us the path that we must go. Lord, we're so thankful this evening. We're so thankful for these services. So many times you come here and you make yourself manifested amongst us. And Lord, let us just not go the same way that we came. We pray we leave better, Lord. the petitions that were read, Lord, those that are in the hearts of my brothers and sisters, we ask, Lord, that you grant them according to their faith. And Lord, over the weekend, our faith should be hired. We have so much to be thankful for. I just can't I can't stop saying thank you Lord. Thank you Lord. We love you Lord. We ask that you continue to be with us the rest of the service with the children's department for the job that uh they have the work that they have put in for this this service. We ask that they be in your precious hands. Also for the offering, we ask you bless the cheerful giver. In the name of the Lord Jesus Christ, we pray. Amen. Amen. Amen. You may be [Music] seated. Has anybody ever struggled? No. Right. Has anybody had shattered [Music] dreams? How about your hopes? Have they been crushed before? I want to tell you about a love of God when you're up against a struggle that shatters all your dreams. And your hopes have been truly crushed by Satan's manifested seas. Can you feel the urge within you to submit to earthly fear? Don't let the failure stand in seem to disappear. Praise the Lord. He can work through those who praise him and praise the Lord for our God in heaven. Praise. Praise the Lord. For the chains that seem to bind you serve only to remind you that they drop powerless behind you. Hey, now Satan is a liar. He wants to make you think that you are poppers when he knows his son that your children are lucky. So lift up the mighty shield of faith for the battle must be won. We know that Jesus Christ is with him. So the works are done. And praise the Lord. He can work through those who praise him to praise the Lord. For our God in heaven is praise. Praise the Lord. [Music] serve only to remind you that they are powerless behind you when you pray. I love I love your son. Love your love. Your [Music] [Music] song [Music] guesses the song. [Music] almost [Music] Love [Music] your glory. [Music] with [Music] you. Oh, I love [Music] your love of yours with your son. [Music] Oh, let's sing that one more time. Praise the Lord. Praise the Lord. Praise the Lord. Praise the Lord. He can work through those who praise him and praise the Lord for our God in his praise. Praise the Lord for the chains that seek to bind you serve only to remind you that they are power led behind you. Let's say it one more time. Oh, praise the Lord. Praise the Lord. Can we sing it one more time with all our hearts? Praise the Lord. Hear it. Praise and praise the Lord for our God in Harris. Praise. Praise the Lord for the chance I see to find my [Music] ser when you pray. [Music] For the chains that seem to bind you, serve only. to remind you that they got power behind you. Praise him. Let's praise him. Give him praise this [Music] afternoon. Hallelujah. Amen. As we sing this next song, let me ask you a question. Do you think God is done with you yet? Do you think you've had enough of God this weekend? [Music] You might think you're done, but he ain't. Amen. I remember camp 2004, 2005. God came into my heart and he did a beautiful thing. He changed my eyes. He changed my heart. He changed my way of thinking. And I thought, "That's it. He's done with me. There's nothing more. God's blessed me beyond my wildest dreams. There's no way he could have more for me. But then Sunday night happened. [Music] It was it it wasn't even supposed to be a service. [Music] It was only supposed to be testimonies and specials. And as the service progressed, I thought God, if you have something more for me, give it to me, Lord. And little by little, I started making my way to the altar. And before I knew it, God had engulfed me in his presence. And that night, he gave me my new birth. So when you be careful, be careful cuz when you think that God doesn't have anything left for you and you think God is done with you, oh how mistaken we will be. As we sing this song, we'd like to welcome the drama for tonight. And I pray with all my heart that when you leave this building that you are blessed beyond your wildest dreams and that when you go home that you stay on fire for our Lord Jesus and that you let your light shine so bright that you change the world cuz that's what Jesus did. And like the brother said this morning, Jesus is our older brother. What? Is our older brother. Amen. [Music] Lord Osa in Jerusalem by day. The soldiers tried to clear the narrow [Music] street, but the crowd pressed into sea. The man condemned to die on Calary. He was bleeding from a beating. There were stripes upon his back. And he wore a crown of thorns upon his head. And he bore with every step. Oh, the son of those who cried out for his name. [Music] Maria called the way of suffering. Like a lamb came the Messiah, Christ the King. But he chose to walk that road out of his love for you and me. down the Lord to Calary. Oh, this song tears me up. [Music] [Music] But it again [Music] [Music] Veny [Music] The blood that would cleanse the souls of all men made its way through the heart of Jerusaley. [Music] Like a lamb came the Messiah, Christ the King. Nobody chose to walk that road out of his love for [Music] him. Down the [Music] be way to calary. la. [Music] Oh [Music] la the blood that Atwood cleanse the souls of old men made his way through the heart of Jerusale down the Lord called the way of suffering. Like a lamb came the Messiah, Christ the [Music] King. But he chose to walk that road out of his love for you and [Music] me down the Lord all the way to Calary. [Music] Amen. Praise the Lord. We're going to be getting into our program now and we're going to be dimming the lights in the uh auditorium here and we're going to have the the lights focused on the stage. So, if you do need to get up to go out, we ask that you just watch your step and be careful. And we hope you enjoy what God has prepared for you. [Applause] New York. [Music] [Music] No. He's a Canto [Music] for Itala. [Music] [Laughter] [Music] Let it go. Let it go. Let it go. [Music] [Music] Ital. [Music] Let [Music] [Music] them like to God [Music] bless. [Music] So, [Music] [Applause] Amen. Amen. How great is the mercy of God? How great is God's mercy? Be ye merciful as your father in heaven is merciful. There was a story of a man. He had two sons. And the youngest of the sons said, "Give me my inheritance." So, so after much pleading, the father finally gave in and he gave him what belonged to his son. But his son took that and he wasted it on prodigal living. [Music] Man, I'm fed up. I'm tired of this whole situation. Pups, you're a wealthy man. And what am I doing? I'm just sitting here waiting. Waiting for what? For you to hit the grave? Nah, I don't got that kind of time to waste. You see, you don't understand what it's like to be a young man who needs to move at a much quicker pace. That's why I'm here. so I can get what's mine. Give me my inheritance so I can hit the road and shine. Nah, nah, nah. I made up my mind. Give me my inheritance so I can hit the road and shine. [Music] So there I go on a new adventurous road in a far away land with a bag full of gold. friends. I got plenty of those. I'm living that fast life like a young man is supposed to be living. Not caring about what was or was to become. Just what is living in the now. Young, rich, living senseless and wild. But after a while, I noted that noticed that the herd was beginning to thin. whispers from my so-called friends like, "Man, what happened to him? He was cool until the money ran out, but now not so much." You see, the friends and the money, they both came and left in a rush. And plus, a famine's hit the land. So now it's every man for himself. Me, I've spent all my wealth, so I got to take any kind of work I can find. [Music] I mean, I don't mind. It's an easy choice between starving to death and feeding me swine. But I think I'm starting to lose my mind. Cuz these slops that I give these pigs to [Music] eat, it's starting to look kind of tasty to me. I said, I think I'm losing my mind because these slabs that I give these filthy, unclean animals to eat, it's starting to look kind of tasty to me. How could this be? How could I have fallen so low? Me wanting to eat these slops when at my father's house, his slave, his servant's fridge is about to explode. So much food to spare. Why' I even leave there? How could I ever go [Music] back? I'll tell him. I'll tell him, "Father, I've sinned against you and I've sinned against God. I'm not worthy to be called your son. But at least make me one of your servants. Even if it's the lowest [Music] one. I'll tell him. I tell him, "Father, I'm not worthy to be called your son. But at least make me one of your servants. Even if it's one of the lowest [Music] ones. Father, I've sinned against you. I've sinned against God. I'm not worthy to be called your son. But at least make me one of your servants. Even if it's even if it's one of the lowest ones, Father. Father, I've sinned against you. I've sinned against God. I'm not worthy to be called you. Father, is that you? Father. Father, I've sinned against you and I'm sinned against God. I'm not worthy to be called. Stop. Stop. You're back. You're back. Someone help me. Please get this drugs off of here. Get this filled off. Get off my Please. My son. My son that was dead. He's alive. He was love and now he's [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] And I tell you the truth, so it is in heaven with all the angels in heaven. There's a feast with just one soul that comes back into repentance, back to the father's kingdom. Is he not well yet? Oh, my servants ready to die so sick. I've known you. I know you've made supplications and prayers. I know you elders of Jerusalem have prayed, but is there not anybody house in the land of Israel that could be able to heal him? He my servant is ready to die. He's so important to our household. Yet there is a man by the name of Jesus. He Heals Jesus. Yes. He can he can do a miracle on on him. Yes.

Please, I beseech you. Hey Jesus, why don't you tell about that time when you multiply the [Applause] Let me tell you, God is so faithful. He will Jesus. Jesus, please. I was sitting here by centurion. He asked that you please breathe. Breathe. He ask that you please heal your servant. Please, Jesus. He's a worthy man. He He loves He loves our nation and he's built us a synagogue. Would you please would you please heal a servant? Yes. Take me right away. Take my lord. My friend. Yes. Look who's here. Look who's coming. Boys, is that crowd? Could that be him? Yes. There's hope yet. Oh, please, my friend, do please do me a favor. Anything. Send him a message. Tell him from me that that I said, "Lord, trouble not thyself that that that I am not worthy for him to to come underneath the roof." You not worthy. Neither am I worthy for for me to go see him. But if he would just speak the word that I know my servant would be healed. I know that well for one thing that I am a man of authority. If I tell him to go, he goeth. And if I tell him to cometh, he cometh. That's right. As I also know that he he has to be a man of authority. But what you speak of him that if he would command the clouds to move, if he would command the ocean to go, he it would be possible. Just do me the favor and ask him. Amen. That I'm not worthy. Yes. Just just speak the word. I will. I will. Thank you. I was right right this way. He says, "Wait, wait, please. I have a message, my Lord. Message for my friend." And he says this, "Lord, do not trouble yourself, for I am not even worthy to for you to come under my roof. I'm not even worthy to come before you." Wow. Now I am a man of authority. He says, I tell a servant to go and he goeth. I tell another servant to come and he cometh. But he knows that if you say the word, just speak the word, it will be done. It will be done. So wow. I have not seen faith like this in all of Jerusalem. Go tell him that this very hour it shall be done. His servant is healed. Well, thank you. Thank you so much. Thank you.

Amen. Can you give your Lord a clap offering? Amen. Praise him harder. Oh, thank you, Jesus. Thank you, Lord. Thank you, Lord. Amen. The song that we're about to sing was written by a a special person. And they say that before they wrote this song that they were looking out into the congregation and the person saw how many sick people they had among them and it broke her heart. It seemed like there was no hope. And I can only imagine the scene in heaven when Jesus looked down on his people. And he saw the condition of his love. He sent Jeremiah. He sent Elijah. He sent Elijah. He sent Moses. He sent all these men before him. But none could pay the price to redeem his creation. [Music] And Jesus and God looking down seemed like there was no hope. The m he he thought I have to go. It has to be me. And then Gabriel came up to him. No Lord, don't go for they'll mock your name. They'll crucify you. Amen. Don't go. Send me. Send me Lord. Let me go in yourstead. Let me pay the price. Let me lay down my life. And God looked at Gabriel. No son. And then Michael came up. No, Lord. Please, Lord, don't go. Don't go. Please, send me. And then the next person, send me. And the next, send me, Lord. And God said, stop. I must do this for I am their the kinsman redeemer. Nobody can pay the price but me. And with tears in his eyes, he took off his crown. He lay aside his robe. He put the splendor to one side and he began to walk down heaven onto earth so that he may be crucified so that we may have a blessed assurance because God cannot fail. And had it not been for him, none of this would have been possible. But we serve a God who is mighty and just. Amen. blessed assur. I know all is well. [Music] Things may seem so impossible, but I know God cannot fail. Just look back and see how many times you were at the end. And God deliver you with a mighty hand. Yes, assurance is well blessed [Music] assurance. I know all is well. Things may seem so impossible, but I know God cannot fail. Just look back and see how many touch you were at the end. And God delivered you with his mighty hands. Blessed assur. I know all is well. You have considered me Jesus. When the world despised [Music] me, Lord, you have purchased me. When I thought I couldn't be lost, Lord, I just want to say how much I love you. I lift my hands to praise and praise you for I know that all of your promises you will fulfill. Yes, [Applause] I know all is well. Things may seem so impossible. But I know God cannot fail [Music] just you were at the end. Blessed I know all is well. Well, you may be believing, just keep on believing for your unsafe loved ones. Come on. Come on. For total healing when the doctor says nothing else can be done. But my redeemer see his report says it's a finished work. So you claim every inch of the devil stole from [Music] you. We have blessed assurance. I know all is [Music] well. Things may seem so impossible, but I know God cannot fail. Just look back and see how many times you were at the end. And God delivered you with his mighty hand. Blessed assures. I know all this well. You may be believing for your backsliding loved ones. for total healing when the doctor says nothing else can be done. But my redeemer's position and your enemy is old. He is defeated. So claiming it's a ground that devil stole from you. Calling God's name. Blessed [Music] are his way. Though it seems impossible, yet God rules that it cannot fail. Just look back and see how many times he over at the end. And God delivered you with his mighty hand. Blessing assurance [Music] all. Oh blessed. Oh, I know his way is so impossible, but I know God cannot fail. Oh, just look back and see how many times you were at the end. deliver you with his mighty hand. Oh, I know this [Music] will all [Music] [Applause] They don't know what they're doing. It is finished. [Applause] [Music] [Music] Can I ask you a question? Yes, I can ask you a question. Is our God dead? What is the status of our God? Someone caught on. He is risen. What does that mean? When they laid Jesus in the tomb, he stayed there all Friday night. All day Saturday. Come on. But on Sunday, he rose. But I want to talk about what happened on Saturday night. You see, Jesus went down to hell and he saw all of the saints still in bondage. and he saw that the devil had the keys of and the and the sting of death. He went up to the devil and he clocked them right in the mouth. He said, "Give me those keys." And he rose on Sunday morning as a sign that the work that needed to be done was finished completely and that the gap between the creator and the creation was no longer there. But Jesus's outstretched arms made a way back to go home. And it's because he is risen that we're all here. You know, in Isaiah, the scripture says that it pleased God for his son to be bruised. Amen. that it pleased the Lord to see him as the sacrifice because he knew why and he knew what was going to happen because of one because of one that stood on the cross. He was going to gain the whole world. It pleased him for Jesus to be bruised and to be battered and to be broken. When I read that, it blew my mind. There's many fathers in here today. I don't know. I I don't have a son, but I couldn't imagine giving up my son to pay the price, to have him walk down the streets and to be mocked and spit at and to be kicked and to be bruised, to be humiliated. But it pleased God. Thank you, Lord. Thank you, Jesus. Thank you, God. Thank you, Lord. Because had it not been for Jesus's sacrifice, how lost we would be, there really would be no hope. But just as the sun rises a new each day, hope rises, love rises, peace rises, strength rises. But Jesus paid the price. We can take another step and go a little bit further and try one more time and go a little harder because he is risen. Oh, thank you, [Music] Lord. God is faithful. Amen. The scripture in 2 Thessalonians 4:16 [Music] states, "For this we say unto you by the word of the Lord, that we which are alive and remain until the coming of the Lord shall not prevent them which are asleep. For the Lord himself shall descend from heaven with a shout, with the voice of the archangel, and with the trump of God, and the dead in Christ shall rise first. Then we which are alive and remain shall be caught up together with them in the clouds to meet the Lord in the air. So shall we ever be with the Lord. And that is the hope of every believer. It's a promise that he gave us. Amen. And if I know one thing and that is that God is faithful and he keeps his promises. If you know this song, sing it with us. Beautiful, precious memories. Amen. Do you want to know where I'm going? Where I'm going? I'm going [Music] through where I'm going. We're one step away from the finish line. We can't quit now. I'm going to hell for me. I'm going up yonder. I'm going up yonder. I'm going up yonder to be with my Lord. Do you want to go? I'm going up yonder. I'm going up yonder. I'm going up yonder to be with my Lord. Listen now. Oh, I can take the pain. All the heartaches they bring. [Music] I've got comfort in knowing I'll soon be [Applause] gone. Oh, as God gives me grace. Hallelujah. I'm going to run this race until I see my Savior to me. I'm going up beyond. I'm growing up yonder. I'm growing up to be with my Lord. I'm going up yonder. I'm going up yonder. I'm going up yonder to be with my Lord. I can take the pain, the heartaches they bring. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. I've got comfort in knowing [Music] hallelujah. I'm going to run this race until I see my savior. [Music] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. I'm going be to be with my Lord. [Music] I'm going up beyond. I'm going up beyond. I'm going up beyond to be with my Lord. I'm going up beyond. I'm going up beyond. I'm going up yonder to be with my Lord. Do you want to go up yonder? One of these days it's going to happen. One of these days it's going to take place. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. I'm going up beyond earth to be with my [Applause] Lord. Why? Why? Why? A question that'll never be mastered. Why? Why? Why? A question with infinity answers. Why? Why? Why? Who knows? Nor you are I. Why? Why? Why? My heart violently screams as it's painfully beating inside. Why? I asked myself questions that I could have answered if I tried. It's me against me. I against I a white dog, a black dog until the day that I die. I against I me against me. Who would have thought that I'd be my worst enemy? He's there when I'm awake and he's there when I'm asleep. And brother, he's waiting for me in the school parking lot cuz he sure doesn't want to hear these words that I speak. So this is for me. Who? Me? Yeah, you. The one who's trying to kill me and murder me. The one that claims to know my every weakness. The critic. The man holding up my every single insecurity. The one throwing low blows. The one fighting dirty. digging around through my memory to find something new to use to come out and strangle me. Digging up those yesterdays that I so frantically laid into graves. And brother now just remembering the remains of my dead and gone today's one behind that way of thinking I had when I confessed to the world I am a living hell. And brother that voice that I work so hard as silence just keeps on breaking free from his padded cell. Cuz all he wants to do is hurt me. All he wants to do is hurt himself. The one that runs straight into the gates of hell when he wants to feel a little bit better and calls that garbage help. Whispering terrors, you can't do it. You're not good enough. Always putting me down. Ruben down in the gutter. Why don't you stay? The one that had me avoiding the mirror because brothers and sisters, I was afraid. That low down life that I was living was taking a toll. You see, my shadow itself was simply a grave. Pushing and pushing. Come on, let's see how bad it can get. Brother, I had an itch and I scratch with razor blades and cool down with lit cigarettes, claiming dying's never been so fun. Brother, you just can't ever die soon enough when your state of mind is live fast, die young. Yes, here lies the one and Reuben's his name. The one that got me in every critical condition, bad situation and still looked around for someone to blame, saying, "Son of God, look where you been. Look where you from. You yourself know you're not even at 10% and your Christian don't walk the way you're supposed to. But brother, that soft still voice inside begins to get loud and say not worthy. Huh? Well, that's right. No one is. But that doesn't change the fact that he chose you. Amen. Justification. Yeah, it's okay. But brother, that sometimes that's as far as this wants to go. Sanification is a brother. When it comes to the Holy Ghost, this right here sometimes wants to cry out no thanking the Lord for the blood that he's bled. Repents and repents and goes around does the very same thing again and again. Still thanking the Lord for the blood that he's bled. And when he finds himself between a rock and a hard place, he finds comfort in the word. But sometimes this right here can't take the lashes from the things that the father has said. Doing enough just to get by. And when the Holy Ghost begins to come down, it's not by feeling, but oh with a feeling that he's real quick to deny. That's why he hardens his heart, says it isn't for me. Locking it up and throwing away the key. Saying, "I can't cry. I can't let the Joneses see me cry. Can't go to the altar. What would so and so think?" Convincing himself that his heart's made of stone. Well, brother, let me ask him a question. Why is it you cry yourself to sleep every night and break down whenever you're all on your own? That don't sound like no heart of stone to me. I want to be a Junior Reef. I want to be a Art Magna. I want to be a Benjamin Garcia. I want to be a Sergio Narete. A walking, talking, living, breathing testimony. But the man in the mirror that says he knows me, looks me straight in the eye, calls me a phony. The same hands that wipe away my tears are the same hands behind my toes and snares. Brother, this right here, this is the cross that Reuben and only Reuben must bear. Must Jesus bear the cross alone while all the world runs free. No, there's a cross for everyone, my brother, and there's a cross out there for me. It's me against me, I against I, a white dog, a black dog until the day that I die. A consecrated cross, I'll bury till death shall set me free. And then go home my crown where there's a crown out there for me. Oh Lord, let me make it through today just for today. So that on that day I can say, "Oh precious cross, so glorious crown, oh resurrection day, ye angels from the stars, come down and bear my soul away." Amen. God bless you. So uh I was uh born and raised uh being a Christian being in uh the Christian religion which is a blessing and over the years as I you know became uh we're coming up to my teenage years um there's been a lot of like temptations a lot of trials that have occurred during it and so you know it's being in what I'm in now high school you know you try to fit in with the right crowd and sometimes that pushes you away from the word of God and you know and like just just being out there being out there partying and and it just it just doesn't make you want to be here. And so over time, you know, I kind of just lost the feeling of uh wanting to go to church or wanting to even uh show up. And um I kind of just went with the emotions of things, you know. I, you know, I just showed up there cuz I had to be there cuz I was cuz I was like almost like obligated to be there. I just wanted to get it done. I just wanted to get it over with. Honestly, I just wanted right after I just wanted to go hang out with my friends, go out and party, and you know, I I really did not want to be there. And so sometimes it's it's hard because in the back of your mind, you know that I'm a child of God. And and sometimes you just you you know you want to change but it it's hard cuz you keep wanting to do those things and you're kind of scared of change and so so you're kind of like scared of change and then and so um sorry and so um it makes it it makes it hard it makes it hard to live that life. And honestly, uh, being being a c- being Christian is is hard and it has it has its ups and downs, but I always know that God's right there beside me and then whenever I need him, he'll always be there. And so I know that I shouldn't be afraid to change because because I know that he will if I put my life in his hands, then he will guide my way. You know, it it's honestly you can't it it's God we're talking about. You can't just give him, you know, 50%. You know, if you really want to change, you have to put your all into it, your whole heart into it and like he will make the change for you. You just got to put your trust into him. Amen. How many of us can identify with that tonight? Amen. That's right. He's with us at all times. Hold to God's unchanging hand. Trust in him. He will not leave you. That's right. We're we're gonna have our brother Aaron come up right now and talk a little bit about his struggles and uh we know that God is always with us. Amen. Good evening. God bless you all, my brothers and sisters. We are brothers and sisters, right? Amen. I'm just here to give a little bit of my testimony and hope that it'll be a blessing or that it can it can touch somebody tonight. Um, you know, I like my cousin who came before me, I was born and raised in the message. Um, it's a privilege and an honor and honestly something that I've been taking for granted. Um, if I could go back and I changed so many things about my life. Um, but you know, God, he he does things for a reason. And recently, I've just felt like I've been running away from my religion. You know, I I just haven't been wanting to come to church. Um, it's something I've struggled with for a while and I just don't have I don't have the the desire to go or to do it. I've become comfortable with my own life. A life that that you know, you go out in the world and you see everything and it looks good. Everything looks good. You know, they show you in the commercials, you see it on social media, speaking to the people that are on social media. Everything looks great. But why are we selling ourselves short? Well, we we are children of God. Why? Why don't we claim what is ours? And so I have been struggling and I've been going through the motions. I've been going to class and I was in I was in u one of my storytelling classes. Um they teach you, you know, the art of storytelling and we had an assignment to choose to choose a story and you know I just treated it like any other assignment. Okay, I'll I'll choose a story. And so I chose this story and and long story short, the story ended up being about somebody who gave their life for people who didn't deserve it. And me going through that, I had been struggling with all these things with not wanting to go to church and running away from from from God and just not wanting to do it. And there where I least expected in the classroom while telling my story, it was God coming down and telling me that I haven't forgotten about you. And it was just honestly it was it was so eyeopening and just such an experience to know that regardless of what I go through and regardless no matter how far I try to run from God, he's still watching each and every one of us. And why my brothers and sisters, why are we going to sell ourselves short? You know, we we all need each other now more than ever. We shouldn't be pushing each other away. And you know many times I notice myself I I'm not very open to people and I apologize for that. But you know we need to learn and we need to grow together because you know the end is near. Why why are we pushing our each other away? You know we should be closer now more than ever. And honestly we are we are children of God. And we just need to remember that. And no matter how far we run, we must always come back to that voice in our heads telling us that that we were made for more, that we deserve more. and that regardless, you know, just just give it all to him because that's all that we can do. We are unworthy, you know, we, you know, we're born in sin and honestly, we just need to give it all to him. And I hope that, you know, that something that I have said has touched you and honestly, I just wish all of us the best. You know, we're all in this together. God bless you. [Applause] We're we're here tonight because brother, we we don't want to play we don't want to play church. It's there's real people with real issues and we believe there's real healing. We believe we believe that Jesus Christ has risen and with he's with us here today. He's not just that God with the centurion. He's not just the God with with the prodical son and the king back then. He's here with us today resurrected in our lives today. We're going to Okay. Well, what brother Aaron said, God, God's always with us. He's always there. He's always been there. That soft little that small voice inside of you that tells you not to do it when you do it, brother. That's that's that's the little portion of God that's always with you. That's the that's the identification of a of a son and daughter of God. Not everybody has that voice. Now everybody, not everybody has that. Brother Dante right here is going to share his experiences and speak about the about what what God has put in his heart. Hello and God bless you everyone. Uh my name is Dante and I am a little nervous to be standing before you here today, but I would just like to jump into it. Um so it was camp of 2013 where I had an experience with the Lord and I received something special and through that experience uh it just made me want to read the message and you know pray every day talk to the Lord every day and it was like that for a while but I would like to be real with you guys and real with myself. I did lose that fire and I did fall into temptation. You know, I um I did find myself hanging out with the wrong group of friends. Um you know, I did drink and I went ahead and partied. Um but after doing those things or even during sometimes I would feel convicted and guilty. I guess you could say it was I would, you know, that small voice that you hear in your head, you know, telling you that what you're doing is wrong and it always just hit me hard sometimes. But, um, but I knew that if change did come, um, you know, I wouldn't be living that lifestyle no more. And it was a lifestyle that I did become used to. And I did become I became scared of uh for change, you know. And um I did find myself uh not wanting to accept the the way that I was living was wrong. And so even though I am not or I'm not where I'm supposed to be, I I have faith that through this the conviction that I feel or or through prayer that the Lord will will set me on the right path. But not only do I hear voices that um tell me, you know, what you're doing is wrong, I do also hear or get have thoughts that, you know, you're not worthy. You know, like what you had is gone. and you're never going to get it again. But to set aside all emotion and feelings, I just have to believe that I am a son of God and that he will help me one day. Amen. how I used to think then and how I think now. And I remember feeling ever since I was younger, since I was born in this message that I I never party, drink or like had this huge like sin like that and I just felt like I did sin and I was hurting. in church that you're born in sin. So, but I just thought my sins were not always not big enough for me to to think that I needed to go to the altar and cry about it. Just like everybody else, I always saw them crying for for whatever reasons they had. And and I just felt like I had really no reason to cuz though I I I did do stuff wrong cuz I I was I've never been perfect but just felt like my like people always have like this like this story to tell of how God changed them and it's always something big or like they've almost died or how they God brought them out of something. I just felt like that wasn't me. So, I didn't want to be like type of person who who would fake it and go to the altar cuz I wanted my feelings with God to be sincere. So, I was stuck in that feeling of like I didn't see a point of of what to ask God. I didn't I didn't see if there was a reason for me to ask God of anything or be sad of anything. But I also was being in that situation. I was very frustrated they and mad how all those people could do all that party drink or whatever it would be. And for me it was so complicated and so hard because something could always be there to me stopping me from doing or not feeling not not feeling right of even being a part of that. And I was mad cuz like I I didn't want that to be there. And I've had my different experiences with God, whether it be me and God alone in church or me and God alone in my room. And I I little by little have come to the realization that not many people can say that that God's kept them from those things and that I am blessed for being able to to do that for God helping me through that, keeping me from all those things. And I um and now that I I have the choice in my heart, I have an understanding now in my heart that I do have to be sorry for my sins, even if they're the simplest thing. And I have to have God in my heart completely. And I'm still this day um wanting that with you. I know I want you in my life and I know that I'm not where I used to be, but I want to give my heart completely to you. And I just one day I want to be certain and I know that for now. I know now that I want you in my life and I just want you to guide me and guide my heart to where you want [Applause] it. God bless you. Um, if there are any visitors here, my name is Tiffany. Um, I've been coming to this church since I was at least four years old. And this is my short testimony about a small part in my life that I'm saying not for me. I'm saying this for all of you because I love you. And if what I'm about to say touches at least one person, then that would mean a lot to me. and pretty sure that God would be happy. After many liberations at many camps, I came back home only to desire the same thing that I know isn't good for me. Growing up, I had low self-esteem. I never felt beautiful and never felt wanted. I knew of the love of God, but as a young girl with low self-esteem, I craved a tangible being to want me, to call me his and beautiful and loved. I never knew to guard my heart because I loved attention. And when I got it, I tried so hard to not let go. I did everything to make sure this person who made me feel so alive never wanted to leave. I would lie. I compromised my value to keep someone who I thought I loved. I lied to myself and thought that I didn't need to follow God's work to every letter in order to have a happy relationship in a Christian life. So after many camp liberations, I felt that I was set for life. I felt that I was okay and that's all I needed, just an experience here and there. I come back to this person and crave that attention, forgetting the attention that God had for me on the cross. It was not only selfish, but it was damaging to more than just me. Of course, not listening to God. God's still small voice in my heart caused me a broken heart. So, I stopped relying on my emotions and me and feelings. And I cried out to God alone in my room. Not at church, not in a meeting. It was alone in my room. Just me and God to wake me up from this unreal love that I was addicted to. To keep me from lying for affection, from craving temporary love and to just hold me in his arms as I fall into his true love and his love only. I allowed him to break my chains and to give me freedom of myself, to give me his godly confidence and to be brave and confident in who he has made me to be. God bless you. You know, I experienced God's love at a very young age, and during the years after that, I had more experiences at camp. But little by little, I started to feel like it wasn't real anymore. And being grown up in this church, I saw a lot of fake, and I didn't want that. And I saw actually Satan was very sneaky enough to hide these invisible chains. These chains that wore skirts. These chains that talked to Christian talk. These chains that could sing a special. These chains that could praise God. But in my heart, I knew there was something wrong. It wasn't until 2011 where I realized and God revealed it to me that I needed to feel him in my heart. But the real Jesus because life without Jesus is no life at all, you know, and and I don't want to waste my time, you know. I want to fight the good fight, but fight it for Jesus. And I want the real Jesus. And I can't say that more because it's it's so scary to see that you can play a role as being a Christian and no one will know that you're not even serving the real Jesus. So I thank God that I'm blessed and that I'm certain that he is real in my heart. Thank you. [Applause] [Music] Brother Brandham spoke about being certain of God. You know, it's it's kind of funny, but even as a Christian, it's kind of hard being certain of God cuz uh this this world just it attacks you from left and right and and from straight away, you know. Uh um God found me at my lowest point. I was uh I was at college in a dorm room in a bathroom and and I knew I had something more for me than a life like that. And um he told me, you know, that that you you are you are worth so much more than this. And you know, some of you may know me. I I I I've I've received my new birth in 2010. And and even though it's still hard today, I know that these chains here, they don't bind me because God God is with me. God is God is everything to me. And and and he can be everything to you. You know, uh um we we we should be the happiest people on on the face of the earth because he's given us everything. And I just want to let you guys know that today or tomorrow, it could be your day. It doesn't have to be, you know, a a a message or or or or a brother coming up and speaking to you. You know, you just have to have that personal relationship with him. Pray to him and and he'll give you everything that your heart desires. Thank you. [Applause] Amen. Let's give the Lord a hand of praise this evening. Let's really just let him have praise. Hallelujah. Somebody say, "Praise the Lord." Somebody say amen. Have you enjoyed yourself this evening? Can you just say amen? Thank you, Jesus. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. I'm not going to apologize. But if you need to forgive me, I I pray that you would when our brother was worship leading worship a little earlier. I wasn't drawn to brother Joseph. I was drawn to the presence of God. Can we say amen? Amen. People go out to rap concerts and rock concerts and they all rush the stage, you know, and they want the guy who's singing to touch their hand. But in a church setting, we all stay in our seats like we don't know what we're doing. That man's anointed, and I wanted some of that anointing. Can you say amen? So I I had I wanted to not touch you, but I wanted to be in that presence. And as I was watching the plane before they got to the part where the young lady was trying to touch uh Jesus, I started to repeat out loud, touching Jesus, touching Jesus, touching Jesus. My wife said, "What? Okay. I said, "Touching Jesus. Something about touching Jesus." And then they begin to pull off that drama. I didn't know. And the intensity of of the actors. Can you say amen? But see, to me, I don't know who the girl was, but to me, she wasn't acting. Come on, somebody. It's it's it might just be a drama drama, but there's something down on the inside inside. Each and every one of you have at one time either have been there or you are there. Can you say amen? The quieter the amens, the know the the way I know you're on to something, right? And so when Jesus began to come down the the via de la roa I got caught up into the the the drama drama. I wanted to run out and grab the cross of Jesus. When he walked my way, I reached out and I touched him. And the brother was crying real tears. Real tears. And and when we came to the back, he said he kept thinking, "Why am I carrying this cross when Jesus said take up your cross and follow me?" But that's not the cross Brother Bernie was trying to portray. I believe I believe when he said, "Why am I carrying this cross?" He was right. He was right because we're supposed to give our cross back to Jesus. How many knows it's true? He died for you. He died for you. He died for you. He died for you so that you wouldn't have to die. Can you say amen? And these young people, I've asked them to stay up here because they're giving their testimony. Listen, I'm not perfect. I'm going to fail you. I'm going to fail you. Brother Mike will fail you. Junior, we'll fail each other. I'll do something stupid. I will fail you. But there is one person here tonight and he'll never leave you. He'll never forsake you. He'll never fail you, but he'll be with you. Even even. Can you say amen? Amen. So these young people, they're giving their testimonies. But many times when you give your testimony, and you forgive me if I say something wrong, but many times when you give your testimony, you're still not quite there. But giving your testimony allows you to put power, allows you to put power. There's power. Power in the blood of Christ. It allows you to put power behind your testimony. The power is Jesus Christ. I cannot save you. Save you. Nobody in this room can save you. Touching Jesus is all that [Music] matters. Touching Jesus. Just touching Jesus. Just that easy. Just touching Jesus. Just touching Jesus. Just touching Jesus is all that matters. That's all that matters. And tonight, if you can't touch, if you can't see Jesus tonight, then why don't you all just stand up for a moment? And if you believe the one next to you has got the Holy Ghost, then why don't you reach out and touch Jesus? must reach out and touch him. Our whole life will never be the same. There is only one way to touch him and that's to believe when you call on power in the [Music] name. Oh, there is power. Come on, reach out tonight. Hallelujah. There is power in the name.
