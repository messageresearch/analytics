[1:09:27] I'm greeting you would you open up your
[1:09:29] scriptures to Exodus 19 the number
[1:09:31] already behind because comment that I
[1:09:36] made that's

[1:09:51] seated um so I'm going to be reading
[1:09:53] from easy reading Bible that's okay to
[1:09:56] interpret that I'm reading from a
[1:09:58] special different maybe a little bit
[1:09:59] different from what it says on the
[1:10:01] screen but that's my comment you have to
[1:10:02] interpret that brother um that's just
[1:10:04] for there's in English so those that
[1:10:05] because the Spanish people don't know
[1:10:08] that I'm it's going to make sound a
[1:10:09] little different okay it's easy readings
[1:10:12] Kings James starting with verse three
[1:10:14] says and Moses went up to God and the
[1:10:17] Lord called him out of the mountain
[1:10:19] saying thus shall you say to the house
[1:10:22] of Jacob and tell the children of
[1:10:35] Israel you have seen what I did to the
[1:10:38] Egyptians and how I bore you on eagles
[1:10:41] wings and brought you to my
[1:10:52] Sal now therefore for if you will obey
[1:10:55] my voice indeed and keep my Covenant
[1:10:59] then you shall be a peculiar treasure to
[1:11:02] me above all the people of for for all
[1:11:06] the
[1:11:07] Earth is
[1:11:22] mine
[1:11:25] young people follow that word
[1:11:29] peculiar nowadays it means
[1:11:36] weird Oddball
[1:11:39] different it means really the root word
[1:11:42] of the mean meaning of the word peculiar
[1:11:43] in the Bible
[1:11:45] me
[1:11:48] particular the possession of
[1:11:52] somebody God's POS possession
[1:11:55] here and you shall be to me a kingdom of
[1:11:59] priests notice that a kingdom of
[1:12:06] priests and in holy nation are the words
[1:12:10] which you shall speak to the children of
[1:12:16] Israel Emily father we thank you for the
[1:12:19] reading of the
[1:12:22] word you present your people before you
[1:12:27] Lord me and my interpreter this morning
[1:12:30] Lord
[1:12:31] God help us forgive our sins
[1:12:35] Lord bring peace to us right now
[1:12:38] Lord Shalom that Prophet spoke
[1:12:43] about you are Jehovah
[1:12:46] Shalom come
[1:12:50] peace come
[1:12:52] peaceful
[1:12:55] God in the name of Lord Jesus
[1:12:58] Christ thankful Lord God that you have
[1:13:01] allowed our
[1:13:02] pastor our ministry here to for us to
[1:13:05] speak this
[1:13:10] morning the entire
[1:13:13] Ministry scho
[1:13:16] group every group in church
[1:13:19] Lord bless them Father bring them closer
[1:13:22] to you in the name of Lord Jesus
[1:13:26] Christ amen amen now you may be
[1:13:30] seated the next scripture we want to
[1:13:34] take is found in in Genesis
[1:13:40] 14 how many saw that part where it says
[1:13:42] a kingdom of
[1:13:47] priests now a kingdom has to do with
[1:13:49] kingship
[1:13:51] right royalty is that
[1:13:54] correct so so we're talking about a a
[1:13:59] kingdom of
[1:14:01] priests so it's combining the the we
[1:14:04] would say like the political part
[1:14:08] of but it's not that's not the right
[1:14:10] word I
[1:14:11] want but you know what I'm saying it's a
[1:14:15] kingship and then the priesthood the
[1:14:17] religious
[1:14:19] part everybody see
[1:14:21] that it's very simple right
[1:14:24] Kingdom of
[1:14:26] priests now let's look at verse of 18 19
[1:14:30] 20 of Genesis
[1:14:34] 14 and before I read
[1:14:37] that brother brother Johnny can brother
[1:14:40] Jonathan can correct me if I in the
[1:14:44] pronunciation but the king here speaks
[1:14:47] about is
[1:14:50] MC and it's a compound word in Hebrew
[1:14:57] it's is that right Jonathan corre
[1:15:00] Jonathan and the other part
[1:15:04] is so we put them
[1:15:08] together and so m means
[1:15:11] king anded means
[1:15:13] righteousness you have the king of
[1:15:18] righteousness none other
[1:15:21] but okay we'll see that okay let's 18 19
[1:15:27] 20 and mesed king of Salem brought forth
[1:15:30] Bread and Wine and he was the priest of
[1:15:32] the most high
[1:15:41] God you see that
[1:15:43] combination people of a
[1:15:46] king and a priest you see how beautiful
[1:15:50] that
[1:15:51] is and I know that you read the
[1:15:53] scripture
[1:15:54] say getting ahead of myself you have
[1:15:57] made us Kings and
[1:15:59] Priests isn't that
[1:16:01] right I'm I'm I'm fulfilling brother
[1:16:05] Bernie I'm fulfilling a request that you
[1:16:07] made about 20 years
[1:16:10] ago not
[1:16:13] me that he
[1:16:15] asked is that what I said did I said yes
[1:16:17] me I'm sorry I apologize um he asked one
[1:16:22] day
[1:16:23] I was sitting over here up here in those
[1:16:26] days
[1:16:27] and turn like this he says maybe some of
[1:16:29] these ministers someday can talk about
[1:16:36] MC I saw nothing in
[1:16:38] it then when I finally hit me about the
[1:16:41] uh King being a king and a priest I
[1:16:45] go it blew my
[1:16:47] mind it's been about 15 years ago
[1:16:50] since touched it another places but not
[1:16:52] here
[1:16:56] and this is a Sunday
[1:16:57] school Sunday school
[1:17:00] lesson and so there's a lot goes along
[1:17:03] with that but let's read that and mesc
[1:17:06] I'm and
[1:17:08] mzed 18 my Bible and MZ king of Salem
[1:17:12] brought forth Bread and Wine and he was
[1:17:14] a priest of the most high God we're
[1:17:16] reading it again
[1:17:20] that's and he blessed them and said
[1:17:22] Blessed Be ABR of the most high god
[1:17:25] possessor of Heaven and
[1:17:33] Earth and blessed and blessed be the
[1:17:36] most high God which was Del which has
[1:17:39] delivered your enemies into your hand
[1:17:42] and he gave him the tenth of
[1:17:52] all
[1:17:54] okay so our next scripture is we're it's
[1:17:58] we're reading a few scriptures for the
[1:18:00] young people to follow through on
[1:18:04] this see if that thing will work is not
[1:18:08] advancing so I'll ask you to go to the
[1:18:10] next slides brother because this is not
[1:18:12] cooperating right now we're probably too
[1:18:14] far away uh first 1 Peter
[1:18:17] 29 again read the entire chapter It's A
[1:18:20] Beautiful chapter all beautiful
[1:18:24] tonight but but you are a chosen
[1:18:27] generation a royal priesthood see that
[1:18:33] again really beautiful when you think
[1:18:35] about it
[1:18:39] Ro I don't have to sell this this sells
[1:18:41] itself but the greatest brother bradam
[1:18:44] said the greatest drawing card in the
[1:18:45] world is the Gospel of Jesus Christ when
[1:18:48] it's preaching the
[1:18:51] simplicity
[1:18:53] and I would say like this in
[1:19:03] Spanish
[1:19:07] [Music]
[1:19:11] amen it was a drawing card
[1:19:15] right drawing
[1:19:21] C
[1:19:23] L but you are a chosen priest you are
[1:19:26] chosen generation a royal priesthood and
[1:19:29] holy nation A peculiar people that you
[1:19:32] should show forth the Praises of him to
[1:19:34] have called you to the dark from out of

[1:35:47] later another day another hour another
[1:35:50] another Channel
[1:35:54] whatever but the Messiahs the anointed
[1:35:58] ones last night it hit me like a ton of
[1:36:02] rocks you know kings are
[1:36:05] anointed priests are
[1:36:07] anointed and anybody that's anointed is
[1:36:09] an anointed
[1:36:11] one how remember that
[1:36:15] scripture oh how beautiful it is to
[1:36:17] dwell in
[1:36:20] unity it's an oil that pours
[1:36:27] down how
[1:36:29] many that's how they would anoint him
[1:36:31] they Anointed with
[1:36:33] oil and I I I know Kings were
[1:36:36] anointed prests were
[1:36:38] anointed but I searched back and forth
[1:36:40] and I could find only one Prophet that
[1:36:43] was
[1:36:48] anointed we know there all Anointed with
[1:36:50] the Holy Ghost
[1:36:53] only
[1:36:54] one find in the scripture Prophet was
[1:37:00] anointed you know who that is yall out
[1:37:03] if you know who it
[1:37:05] is Elisha is
[1:37:08] elas Elijah El the Elijah of our
[1:37:14] day is the Lord Jesus Christ who is the
[1:37:19] Elisha who did Brother said was
[1:37:23] Elisha it's the
[1:37:26] bride so there is the Lord Jesus
[1:37:30] Christ with a big old thing of anointing
[1:37:34] canister of
[1:37:38] oil pouring it on
[1:37:41] elah everything that God was pouring to
[1:37:46] Christ Christ
[1:37:49] was church
[1:37:53] is that beautiful so that Ernie Bara
[1:37:56] could get the
[1:37:59] preeminence that
[1:38:01] right so that
[1:38:03] he the
[1:38:06] prence Jesus Christ the anointed one the
[1:38:11] Lord Jesus
[1:38:13] Messiah the Lord
[1:38:17] Jesus the Lord
[1:38:19] Jesus Holy Ghost
[1:38:22] I don't see how you can separate him
[1:38:23] from the
[1:38:25] deity I got to get my title over Messiah
[1:38:30] means the anointed
[1:38:32] one the the the anointed
[1:38:35] king the it can also mean
[1:38:39] Christ now this
[1:38:41] morning our first use of Messiah deals
[1:38:43] with the thought of the anointed
[1:38:48] king we're going to be looking at some
[1:38:50] of the things brother brandham said
[1:38:52] about the anointed the Kings and the
[1:38:54] anointed
[1:38:57] Kings forward two slides brother okay I
[1:39:00] think that's right right there now the
[1:39:03] first one we want to
[1:39:05] consider young
[1:39:07] people listen to it this
[1:39:10] message at least 20 30
[1:39:13] times what I'm going to suggest to you
[1:39:15] right now again I'm off
[1:39:18] task it's called the five definite
[1:39:27] identifications of the True
[1:39:29] Church of the Living
[1:39:31] God it's one of the four
[1:39:35] books now you got to help me
[1:39:38] here those of you that know this how
[1:39:41] many of you
[1:39:43] here
[1:39:45] 2001 or 200 I think it's
[1:39:49] 2102 and I think the the the the letter
[1:39:53] was typed
[1:39:55] out December
[1:39:57] 26th 2001 I think or something like that
[1:40:01] it starts off like this if you remember
[1:40:02] very somber
[1:40:04] note it says this is the day after
[1:40:09] Christmas anybody remember
[1:40:11] that nobody remembers that
[1:40:14] letter so I'm writing this to my
[1:40:18] friends remember brother do you remember
[1:40:21] that that
[1:40:25] letter brother Charlie if we have it I
[1:40:27] think we need to print it out for the
[1:40:28] church to
[1:40:29] read and in that letter he says a lot of
[1:40:33] things Shak shaking things one of the
[1:40:37] things he says so I'm going to be he
[1:40:39] says in the missionary field so I'm
[1:40:41] going to be only working with four
[1:40:46] books why did why did he go why was the
[1:40:49] shepher did he go to sheer
[1:40:51] why was a Shepherd um taking side with
[1:40:58] Jesus
[1:40:59] messano Messianic
[1:41:03] Empire and five definite five definite
[1:41:06] identification of the true church of
[1:41:08] living
[1:41:13] God so five definite
[1:41:19] identifications
[1:41:21] of the True
[1:41:22] Church of the Living
[1:41:27] God if you're if you're a follower of
[1:41:29] brother brother Bernie's
[1:41:33] Ministry wouldn't you like to know what
[1:41:36] what those four books
[1:41:40] contain and and so one of those that two
[1:41:44] of them are in English take a side with
[1:41:49] Jesus yes yeah
[1:41:52] okay and um that's that he he was
[1:41:55] referring to um um brother bram's book
[1:41:59] of course Jesus brother's
[1:42:02] booko is the only one of those four that
[1:42:05] was his
[1:42:10] preaching and I told him I wouldn't get
[1:42:12] into this but
[1:42:17] I in in the in impediment in in the
[1:42:21] message the five definite
[1:42:23] identifications I'll just say like
[1:42:29] that this is what I'm going be reading
[1:42:31] from right
[1:42:32] now
[1:42:37] okay this is first quote now in the Old
[1:42:39] Testament the known church was called
[1:42:42] the kingdom of
[1:42:45] God God's
[1:42:47] kingdom now I'm taking this from the
[1:42:49] chronology of the Bible
[1:42:52] the Old Testament the church was called
[1:42:54] the kingdom of
[1:42:56] God in other words God is a
[1:43:01] king and the church is his
[1:43:04] domain God's
[1:43:06] kingdom Old
[1:43:09] Testament part two in the New
[1:43:12] Testament it's called the Messianic
[1:43:15] Empire oh I like that Messianic in other
[1:43:19] in other wise
[1:43:21] the messiah's
[1:43:24] Empire where the Empire rules and
[1:43:28] Reigns no denominational barriers or
[1:43:31] nothing the Messiah rules in his
[1:43:35] Empire isn't that wonderful
[1:43:38] thinking
[1:43:39] Empire now young people check out that
[1:43:43] word
[1:43:44] empire heard of the Roman
[1:43:48] Empire during the Roman Empire
[1:43:52] during around the time within 100 or 200
[1:43:54] years of Jesus time actually he was
[1:43:56] killed in 45 or 49
[1:44:03] BC then Octavius takes
[1:44:09] over but is Caesar
[1:44:16] Augustus they were Emperors right yes or
[1:44:19] no
[1:44:21] was there not a king in in Jerusalem in
[1:44:26] Israel so he was a king over
[1:44:29] Kings so to make it real simple see even
[1:44:32] I can understand it what is an
[1:44:36] emperor a King of
[1:44:39] Kings King over
[1:44:42] Kings teachers how many you know that
[1:44:44] that's that's the way it's taught in
[1:44:49] school
[1:44:51] that's it's okay that's how it's King
[1:44:54] over a king is an Empire an
[1:44:56] emperor so an emperor is a king over
[1:45:00] Kings we have Messianic
[1:45:05] Empire the King of
[1:45:09] Kings therefore the church is not an

[1:49:31] other

[1:49:37] possible or is
[1:49:40] it that dried up Jawbone of a
[1:49:49] donkey
[1:49:51] dried
[1:49:52] up is it
[1:49:54] possible that that

[1:51:10] established in the heart and soul of a
[1:51:12] man by a revelation of Jesus
[1:51:18] Christ
[1:51:29] Messiah are anointed ones
[1:51:32] m
[1:51:33] m God made us Kings and
[1:51:37] Priests Jesus is the light of the
[1:51:40] world and he said we are the light of
[1:51:42] the
[1:51:45] world stripping over all these readings
