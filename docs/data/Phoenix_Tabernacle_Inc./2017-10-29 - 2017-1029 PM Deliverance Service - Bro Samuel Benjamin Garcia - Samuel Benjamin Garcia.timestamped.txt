[53:35] yes to see to the last day that we're
[53:39] here on earth so we finally go on to
[53:42] that the place we're across Jordan a man
[53:44] what become someone said : I mean first
[53:47] Peter 1:17 says let's stop going back to
[53:49] the traditions of our fathers
[53:55] whom by we received by vain conversation
[53:58] record ASIMO's in common banner for as
[54:01] much as you know that we were not
[54:03] redeemed by those corruptible things I
[54:05] want to have enough women dirty needles
[54:07] police escorting people but with the
[54:08] precious blood of Christ sina pona sang
[54:11] the praises of a lamb come with him
[54:13] called a without blemish she mentioned
[54:15] and without spot and what did that lamb
[54:18] do that perfect wise that virgin born he
[54:23] was a one who come and took the toxin
[54:26] well give me 50 now and banana in 1960
[54:29] he says brother Benno's says on the bank
[54:32] of jordan and every other course he was
[54:34] inoculated when the heavens were opened
[54:38] oh she have really lost you know and the
[54:40] Spirit of God come down to 12 so God was
[54:45] made flesh she can just wait okay and
[54:47] well - manga see more if you take the
[54:50] toxin upon himself at automatic but see
[54:53] me say what is the toxin it's God's bone
[54:57] that's god's toxin Holy Ghost and it
[55:02] speaks of something we all this this
[55:04] week as III I can understand what toxin
[55:06] meant it's the same element Anila be
[55:08] seen if it seems like such a bad thing
[55:10] okay you know in your body you have
[55:13] toxins see any stuck seen us into what
[55:15] you want to get rid of it but I see this
[55:16] kid is so then why do you why is this a
[55:19] this for this food kitty says so I
[55:21] looked up toxin I seek it's a poisonous
[55:24] substance that is produced by a living
[55:27] thing as soon as substance yeah when you
[55:29] know sakis bluesy opponent said Vivian I
[55:30] said the living being the only one
[55:33] living thing so let me tell you said
[55:35] Vivian God is the only
[55:37] in Luke 1:35 says therefore also and
[55:42] don't study in that holy thing which
[55:46] shall be born of thee shall be called
[55:49] the son of God a motherly qualities so
[55:53] then III was looking at that that
[55:55] definition of poisonous substance mean I
[55:58] rather they see one day what is
[56:01] poisonous because excuse me no sir it's
[56:03] causing sickness or death by entering
[56:06] the body it's comes out in 5 min I don't
[56:08] want Ellen throw I'll quit God wants us
[56:10] to take this he just get a keeper man
[56:12] she wants this and in us and he wants to
[56:16] cause sickness or death Jericho said if
[56:18] it man by entering into the body
[56:20] I don't get it Laurel and diello senior
[56:23] but God's toxin kills the carnality
[56:28] kills the natural method of doctrine
[56:31] it kills the body it kills the desire of
[56:34] the flesh in the cell that academy
[56:36] romans 8 10 and if christ being you the
[56:41] body is dead and queer push them away
[56:43] because of sin a council in picado but
[56:46] the spirit is life
[56:48] muscle disbelieving because of
[56:51] righteousness are they like Justicia you
[56:53] know when when Jesus was walking on
[56:55] those banks
