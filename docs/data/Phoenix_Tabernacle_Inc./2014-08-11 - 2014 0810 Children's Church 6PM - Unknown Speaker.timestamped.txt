[12:04] in the age that we live in there's a lot
[12:06] of uh
[12:09] very educational programs on tv
[12:12] documentaries
[12:13] that talk about
[12:15] very spectacular things specific to
[12:17] nature or things that happen in our
[12:19] world
[12:20] well we're very blessed that we
[12:22] we have uh the next video clip that
[12:24] we're going to be showing you of the
[12:26] 20th century prophet and i want the
[12:28] children to pay very close attention to
[12:30] what
[12:31] the questions that they're asking
[12:33] brother branham and as you hear brother
[12:34] branham answer those questions
[12:37] for those of you that may be new and
[12:39] don't really know who brother branham is
[12:41] i'd like you to
[12:44] just
[12:45] watch it with your heart
[12:47] and see what god has in store for you so
[12:49] if the brothers would would turn the
[12:51] lights off offer me in the back and and
[12:53] the brothers in the back would go ahead
[12:54] and start the video clip first i'd be
[12:56] great it's just going to be a short clip
[12:58] that we're going to play here as a
[12:58] special
[13:01] you can shut these off too brother thank
[13:02] you
[13:30] may i present my wife
[13:32] honey this is brother leroy and paul cop
[13:35] of los angeles california delighted to
[13:38] have you in our home brother carl
[13:43] brother branham in your two great
[13:44] campaigns at los angeles at calvary
[13:47] temple we noticed that the lord jesus
[13:49] christ worked with you in a very special
[13:51] manner with these marvelous gifts these
[13:53] earning of the spirits of men's hearts
[13:56] as well as the sicknesses of the body
[13:58] and the signs of healing and miracles
[14:00] that were wrought we thought it was
[14:02] wonderful
[14:03] awareness to brother branham in hearing
[14:05] more about this unique ministry that god
[14:06] has given you
[14:08] very well brother cop
[14:10] let's go back to the beginning
[14:13] i was born in eastern kentucky
[14:16] in a little log cabin near burtsville
[14:19] kentucky
[14:22] the morning of my birth i'm told of my
[14:24] parents
[14:27] that there was a light came into the
[14:28] room and hung over me
[14:32] my people was not a religious people
[14:35] they did not go to any church
[14:39] of course this
[14:40] caused quite a stir among them
[14:43] it's followed me all the days of my life
[14:46] recently
[14:48] they took a picture of it in the
[14:49] scientific world as shown here
[14:53] you're probably familiar with this
[14:54] picture
[14:56] it was proven by science that was the
[14:58] only
[15:00] supernatural being that was ever
[15:02] scientifically photographed
[15:04] to my opinion
[15:06] it's the same
[15:07] angel of god
[15:10] that followed the children of israel
[15:14] from
[15:15] egypt and to palestine
[15:18] you know as a scholar yourself
[15:21] that was the angel of the covenant none
[15:23] other than our lord jesus christ and
[15:26] when here on earth
[15:28] manifested in flesh
[15:31] he did not claim to be a great person
[15:34] he said the son can do nothing just as
[15:37] the father shows him
[15:41] john the fifth chapter
[15:43] perhaps you're acquainted with it
[15:46] the scripture
[15:48] jesus passed through this famous pool of
[15:50] bethesda
[15:52] he find many crippled
[15:54] people there blind halt lame waiting for
[15:58] the moving of the waters
[16:00] it was strange that he just ministered
[16:02] to one
[16:03] but if you'll notice
[16:05] he knew where that person was
[16:07] the father had showed him
[16:09] he healed this one perhaps he he wasn't
[16:12] crippled
[16:13] he was just laying on a pallet
[16:15] but jesus healed him
[16:18] and then farther in the chapter we find
[16:20] about the 19th verse
[16:22] that he was questioned by the jews
[16:26] perhaps it would be questionable today
[16:29] why god would pass through a place where
[16:30] all those people were lame and halt and
[16:33] blind
[16:34] and would not heal them all
[16:36] but here i'll quote his words
[16:38] he said verily verily i say unto you
[16:41] the son can do nothing
[16:43] of himself but what he sees the father
[16:46] do
[16:47] this doeth the son likewise
[16:50] then according to his own words
[16:53] his ministry was based upon
[16:56] visions from his father
[17:00] would not be strange then that his
[17:01] ministry should be carried on as he
[17:03] promised his disciples the things that i
[17:06] do shall you do also
[17:08] greater than this shall you do for i go
[17:10] unto my father
[17:12] he said a little while and the world
[17:13] seeth me no more
[17:15] yet you shall see me
[17:17] for i'll be with you even in you
[17:20] to the end of the world
[17:22] jesus christ the same yesterday today
[17:24] and forever
[18:26] resurrection of jesus christ living
[18:28] among his people
[18:30] performing the same signs and wonders
[18:32] that he did when he was here on earth
[18:34] at the age of seven
[18:36] we moved from kentucky to indiana
[18:39] up the road a bit from where we live now
[18:42] we packed our water then from a well
[18:46] some city block i suppose behind the old
[18:48] country home
[18:50] one beautiful
[18:52] september afternoon while coming from
[18:55] the pump with some water it was a
[18:57] stately proper tree stood about halfway
[19:01] between the pump
[19:03] and the home
[19:05] passing by there there was a whirl of
[19:06] wind in the tree
[19:08] what we call here uh whirlwind
[19:12] why it was nothing odd for that time of
[19:14] year in this part of the country but it
[19:16] remained in the tree it didn't leave
[19:19] i stopped to see what it was
[19:21] and a voice spoke from it saying do not
[19:24] never smoke or drink or defile your body
[19:27] in any way
[19:28] for there will be a work for you to do
[19:30] when you get older
[19:32] frightened
[19:34] that's not a word part
[19:36] i ran home quickly
[19:38] telling my mother that a man spoke to me
[19:40] out of a tree
[19:42] well she thought i was nervous she put
[19:43] me to bed
[19:45] but from then on visions begin to come
[19:48] and when this comes up on me it produces
[19:51] a vision i'm able to tell people
[19:54] what's wrong with them and
[19:56] what they must do in life and the sins
[19:58] that they are holding back in their life
[20:00] at the age of 37
[20:03] one night i was praying in my room
[20:06] and when i
[20:08] raised up i noticed the light on the
[20:10] floor
[20:11] and looking around to see where it come
[20:13] from it was coming from above
[20:15] the pillar of fire
[20:17] was hanging just above
[20:19] i'm throwing the light on the floor i
[20:21] heard someone
[20:22] walking
[20:24] i looked coming through the room
[20:25] coming into this light came a man
[20:28] and
[20:29] human figure he'd be about 200 pounds of
[20:32] weight
[20:32] he had dark hair to his shoulder and
[20:34] olive complexion
[20:36] is barefooted
[20:38] of course i was frightened
[20:40] and he said to me fear not
[20:42] and as soon as i heard that voice i knew
[20:44] it was the same voice that it always
[20:46] spoke to me but the first time i'd ever
[20:48] seen him in human form
[20:50] he said i'm sent from the presence of
[20:52] god
[20:53] to tell you that you're to pray for sick
[20:54] people great signs and wonders will be
[20:57] following your ministry and you'll be
[20:59] praying for kings and monarchs and so
[21:01] forth
[21:02] well i told him i was a poor man i had a
[21:05] no education i would not be able to do
[21:07] this job
[21:08] he said as moses was given two signs of
[21:11] confirmation of his ministry that i
[21:13] would be given two signs one would be
[21:15] the praying for the sick the miracles
[21:17] and the other would be you know the very
[21:18] secrets of the people's heart
[21:20] i told him that i had
[21:22] been praying about this that the people
[21:24] told me it was of the devil
[21:26] the ministry
[21:27] he referred to me many scriptures such
[21:29] as when
[21:30] philip
[21:31] found nathanael and nathanael came to
[21:33] jesus
[21:34] while jesus told him where he had been
[21:37] for he was under the tree when nathanael
[21:39] found him
[21:40] and
[21:41] many other scriptures such as the woman
[21:43] at the well
[21:44] how that she was revealed
[21:46] her sins to her
[21:48] when jesus told her that she had five
[21:50] husbands she ran into this city and said
[21:52] this is the christ
[21:54] many other scriptures he referred to
[21:58] i told him i would go he gave me the
[22:00] assurance that he would be with me
[22:01] always as you know brother cop in the
[22:04] world knows other great things that's
[22:07] been taking place in the ministry
[22:09] we were thinking about whether these
[22:11] visions i would remember him very long
[22:13] some time ago i had one about four years
[22:16] ago
[22:17] to be exact
[22:18] of a little boy being
[22:20] dead on the side of the road struck by a
[22:22] car and killed and he was to be raised
[22:25] from the dead
[22:26] well
[22:27] i told everybody about it prophesied
[22:30] throughout the united states and canada
[22:32] thousands of bibles had it written on
[22:34] their flower leaks that this would take
[22:35] place
[22:36] one day while we were
[22:38] having campaigns in the scandinavian
[22:40] country we were coming down through
[22:42] finland from kovil
[22:44] and there was a group of people gathered
[22:46] on the side of the road
[22:47] they were hovered over some sort of a
[22:50] farm
[22:50] we got out to look there it was the
[22:53] little boy everything just seen just the
[22:55] way it was shown to me i said to brother
[22:58] moore look at your bible and see if this
[22:59] isn't the scene yes he said
[23:02] i knelt down and asked our lord jesus
[23:04] to confirm his word that he had showed
[23:06] me and it told me would come to pass
[23:08] little boy
[23:10] was brought to life again by our lord
[23:12] jesus he's alive and healthy today
[23:15] brother cop this is just a few of the
[23:17] things that our lord jesus is doing
[23:19] today
[23:20] in the ministry that he has committed to
[23:21] me
[23:22] to my humble opinion
[23:25] is to confirm his word the things that
[23:28] he promised that would happen in this
[23:29] day we are seeing him take place today
[23:35] now concerning the campaigns in israel
[23:37] brother cop
[23:39] i'll be very happy to serve our lord in
[23:41] israel
[23:42] i believe that my ministry will be very
[23:45] effective to the jews
[23:47] because as the scripture says the jews
[23:50] seek signs the greeks wisdom we believe
[23:52] many jews and others there in the holy
[23:54] land
[23:55] will come to believe that the lord jesus
[23:57] christ is a messiah when they see a
[23:59] christian
[24:00] fulfilling the prophecy of joel in the
[24:02] old testament
[24:04] yes brother cop i'm sure that you're
[24:07] referring to joel's prophecy in the old
[24:09] testament joel 2 28
[24:12] how that he prophesied saying that in
[24:14] the last days he would pour out his
[24:16] spirit upon all flesh
[24:18] the sons and daughters would prophesy
[24:21] the old man would dream dreams and the
[24:23] young men would see visions
[24:25] well by the bottom i guess we'll have to
[24:27] say goodbye for this time it certainly
[24:28] has been a great pleasure and very
[24:30] edifying
[24:31] we'll have to be running along but we
[24:33] will see your god willing in chicago in
[24:35] the next couple of days
[24:37] so gentlemen it's
[24:39] been a pleasure to have you in our home
[24:41] tonight
[24:42] we'll be praying together for the
[24:43] success of the chicago meeting and by
[24:46] god's grace i hope to meet you there in
[24:47] the next few days
[24:51] would you care for some key before going
[24:54] thank you very much mr brown that'll be
[24:56] just fine
[24:58] thank you thank you
[25:09] can we give the lord jesus a clap
[25:10] offering
[25:18] we want to talk about uh documentaries
[25:20] and reality tv i don't think there's
[25:24] nothing that's much better than that
[25:25] amen
[25:27] i think that
[25:30] we all understand how
[25:32] god has always dealt with his people
[25:34] according to his scripture that
[25:36] his word will always first come to his
[25:38] prophets
[25:40] and uh according to the scripture in
[25:42] amos and
[25:44] here brother branham is is telling us
[25:46] about
[25:47] his supernatural birth right
[25:50] you know there's a lot of things that we
[25:51] can believe in a lot of things that we
[25:53] hear and a lot of things that we see
[25:54] today in
[25:56] in in this technology age that we live
[25:59] in
[25:59] but if you want the truth
[26:02] there ain't no greater truth
[26:04] than what you just saw there
[26:06] and that's god's prophet pointing us
[26:08] back to god's word amen
[26:11] so there's just so much there that we
[26:12] can talk about it all afternoon but we
[26:13] must continue so i'm going to ask
[26:14] brother how to come on up but isn't he
[26:17] wonderful amen
[26:19] god bless you
[26:21] can uh we please stand
[26:24] we want to welcome you this afternoon to
[26:26] children's church
[26:30] you can turn around and shake your
[26:31] brother's hand and say god bless you
[26:35] with the big giant smile
[26:39] it's always awesome to see a big giant
[26:41] smile on your brother or sister
[26:48] because it brings happiness
[27:05] and not only did he sense the prophet he
[27:07] knows
[27:09] this prophet brought us the word
[27:12] to bring us out
[27:14] of the confusion
[27:17] so we're blessed people today someone's

[37:54] god bless everyone tonight
[37:57] once again it's a sunday afternoon late
[38:00] sunday evening we find ourselves here
[38:05] and we believe that it's it's the lord's
[38:07] calling
[38:08] that we learn about the life of a
[38:11] prophet
[38:13] the prophet our seventh
[38:16] church age messenger
[38:19] william marion branham
[38:21] as you seen on the previous video
[38:24] very precious video taken in his home in
[38:27] 1953
[38:29] the house that that video was was done
[38:31] in was built in 1948
[38:35] uh brother brannon had spoke of some
[38:38] experiences that came to mind
[38:42] as short as that video was it was very
[38:45] deep
[38:46] and rich
[38:48] in what he shared with us
[38:51] what a privilege we have
[38:54] to have
[38:55] a brother such as owen jorgensen write a
[38:57] series of books about brother brennan
[39:01] in my humble opinion
[39:03] he brought the story forth complete and
[39:06] as accurate as humanly possible
[39:09] he consulted a variety of resources
[39:12] including
[39:14] the listening to all of the sermons that
[39:16] are on
[39:18] the media that's available for brother
[39:20] brannon i believe in it's a neighborhood
[39:21] of 1200 sermons
[39:23] he also consulted many people
[39:26] that knew brother brandon firsthand
[39:28] interviewed them
[39:30] meticulously made notes
[39:34] and also
[39:35] consulted other source material that was
[39:37] very near and dear to brother brandon
[39:39] that would help him
[39:40] compile this
[39:42] it was a work of love for him it took a
[39:44] long time
[39:46] he
[39:47] prayed on it
[39:50] he was at a point where he had completed
[39:52] the first book
[39:54] but he did not have
[39:56] the means to publish it
[40:01] he prayed on it
[40:04] and i don't remember the time frame
[40:06] exactly after that but he he received a
[40:08] communication from brother perry greene
[40:10] in tucson
[40:12] saying don't worry
[40:14] this will move forward
[40:17] as we've been doing this series since
[40:19] march of this year
[40:21] we have completed six chapters of book
[40:23] one
[40:26] we are seeing the shaping of
[40:29] the man called william mary and brennan
[40:31] by the by the lord the lord is laying
[40:33] out a path for him
[40:36] and it's not always clear as to what
[40:38] that path is at the time to brother
[40:41] brandon in his life that he's
[40:43] experiencing these things but we have
[40:45] the advantage of seeing
[40:48] the testimonies and hearing the
[40:50] testimonies more precisely
[40:53] to understand what happened
[40:56] and and how it unfolded
[40:59] so without further ado our ambition
[41:01] tonight is to
[41:03] to read three chapters chapter seven
[41:07] eight and nine
[41:12] and if you would please
[41:13] be seated
[41:21] to preserve the continuity of our
[41:23] presentation
[41:25] we will flow from one chapter to the
[41:27] next until
[41:28] we complete the third chapter
[41:32] the first chapter is chapter 7
[41:34] entitled fleeing to the desert
[41:37] 1927-1929
[41:42] chapter 8
[41:44] is entitled the sign follows
[41:47] 1929
[41:49] and then chapter 9
[41:52] is entitled his last chance 1930-1932
[41:58] as with any
[42:00] of the chapters that we have covered and
[42:02] will cover
[42:04] each one is crucial to the formation
[42:07] and development
[42:09] of our prophet
[42:12] i appreciate your presence
[42:15] it's an honor to do a live narration of
[42:17] this
[42:19] and i'd like to thank brother bernie
[42:22] our assistant pastor brother johnny
[42:24] alvarado senior
[42:26] and
[42:27] all of the
[42:28] ministry
[42:31] and support that i've been receiving
[42:34] during this this presentation that we've
[42:36] been doing
[42:37] and it's
[42:39] it inspires me to
[42:41] to do this in such a way that would
[42:43] honor brother branham
[42:46] and and in in the bigger picture we want
[42:49] to d we want to increase our
[42:51] understanding
[42:53] for our profit
[42:57] so without further ado we'll get started
[43:01] when william branham arrived in phoenix
[43:04] arizona
[43:05] mr francisco paid him three dollars for
[43:08] helping with the driving
[43:10] that was all the money billy had in the
[43:12] world but he wasn't worried
[43:15] he was sure some opportunity would turn
[43:17] up
[43:19] it was december in the year 1927.
[43:22] he was 18 years old and bursting with
[43:24] enthusiasm at his new chance in life
[43:28] after sending a letter of explanation
[43:30] home to his mother billy set off to
[43:32] explore the town
[43:35] soon he happened upon an informal rodeo
[43:38] that made him think i'm a real good
[43:40] rider
[43:41] since i'm broke why not get myself some
[43:44] easy money at this rodeo
[43:47] but i'll have to get me a pair of chaps
[43:49] before i go out there in front of all
[43:50] those cowboys
[43:53] he walked down the street to the nearest
[43:55] clothing store and tried on a pair of
[43:57] leather chaps
[43:58] they were magnificent the word
[44:01] arizona was embossed on the belt
[44:04] and they had a steer head worked into
[44:06] each legging with brass buttons for eyes
[44:10] but they were far too long the leather
[44:12] leggings dragged on the floor
[44:15] billy looked at himself in the mirror
[44:16] and thought
[44:18] i look like a bantam rooster mostly
[44:20] fluffing feathers
[44:22] the store clerk said
[44:24] this pair is 25 sir
[44:27] billy was glad for an excuse to turn him
[44:29] down
[44:30] i'm afraid three dollars is all the
[44:32] money i've got
[44:34] the clerk suggested you better
[44:36] compromise with a pair of levi jeans
[44:39] billy bought a pair of levi's and a
[44:41] cowboy hat
[44:42] then returned to the rodeo
[44:44] on top of one fence at a line of
[44:46] bow-legged disfigured cowboys that had
[44:49] looked like they had been through a few
[44:51] cattle drives and range wars
[44:54] billy thought
[44:55] that's where i belong
[44:57] he climbed up on the fence beside them
[45:00] everyone around him was murmuring with
[45:02] excitement
[45:03] billy had arrived just when a famous
[45:05] rider was mounting a notorious wild
[45:07] stallion
[45:09] the horse was boxed into a stall not far
[45:11] away
[45:13] billy watched a long-legged rider drop
[45:15] down on the saddle
[45:17] and he thought if this fellow can't ride
[45:19] that horse then i will
[45:22] the instant the gates sprang open the
[45:24] horse snorted and leaked from its stall
[45:26] with all four feet in the air
[45:28] when it hit the ground it bounded up
[45:30] again twisting its body and kicking its
[45:32] hind legs all at once the rider sailed
[45:36] from the saddle like a straw scarecrow
[45:38] landed with a bone jarring thud and lay
[45:41] motionless in the middle of the corral
[45:44] blood pouring from his nose
[45:46] while the pickup man caught this
[45:48] stallion and put it back in a pen
[45:50] others loaded the unconscious cowboy
[45:52] into an ambulance and drove him away
[45:56] a man rode slowly along the fence where
[45:58] billy sat with all those leathery
[45:59] cowboys
[46:01] he said
[46:02] i'll give fifty dollars to any man who
[46:04] can stay on that horse for thirty
[46:06] seconds
[46:07] the man kept stooping to look at the
[46:10] cowboys in their eyes and repeat his
[46:11] offer
[46:13] no one took him on
[46:15] then the man stopped in front of billy
[46:17] and asked are you a rider
[46:20] no sir
[46:21] billy said sheepishly
[46:23] billy hired on at a cattle ranch
[46:25] northwest of phoenix near a small town
[46:28] called wickenburg
[46:29] his horse riding skills quickly improved
[46:32] until soon he was doing his share of the
[46:34] ranch work a real cowboy just like he
[46:37] had dreamed he would be
[46:39] the beauty of the prairie surpassed his
[46:41] wildest imaginations around him rugged
[46:44] mountains jutted up from the prairie
[46:46] floor
[46:47] giant saguaro cacti dotted the desert
[46:50] flats in the sloping canyon walls
[46:52] the desert was a picture of diversity
[46:55] abounding with prickly pear a small
[46:57] cactus that looked like a beaver tail
[46:59] with long wicked spikes
[47:01] the pin cushion cactus which was covered
[47:03] so thickly with tiny needles that it
[47:05] looked like fur
[47:07] the barrel cactus which looked like a
[47:09] barrel with spiny ribs
[47:11] and the low bushy trees known by their
[47:13] spanish name of palo verde meaning green
[47:16] stick
[47:19] the elusive wildlife
[47:21] also fascinated him
[47:23] gila monsters sidewinder rattlesnakes
[47:26] kangaroo rats and
[47:28] javelina hogs it was also exotic so
[47:31] different from the woodlands of the ohio
[47:32] river valley
[47:34] and to think here he was in the middle
[47:36] of it on a horse kicking up prairie dust
[47:38] working with cowboys and longhorn steers
[47:41] this was living
[47:43] what could be better
[47:44] he felt as though he had stepped into
[47:46] one of those romantic western movies he
[47:48] had watched when he was a boy
[47:51] but after a year and a half of ranch
[47:53] work the illusion of perfection began to
[47:55] wear off
[47:56] as the summer of 1929 plotted on
[47:59] billy grew increasingly dissatisfied
[48:03] many times he wondered what was wrong
[48:05] he had come to the desert to find peace
[48:07] and fulfillment but somehow
[48:09] peace and fulfillment were eluding him
[48:12] he was not happy not entirely
[48:14] something was still missing in his life
[48:16] but what
[48:18] finally it came time for the fall
[48:20] roundup
[48:21] throughout every summer many local
[48:23] ranchers grazed their herds on the same
[48:25] rangelands high up in the mountains
[48:27] where the grass grew thick between tall
[48:29] pine trees
[48:31] every fall they worked together to round
[48:33] up the scattered cattle herding them
[48:35] down to the valley ranches and then
[48:36] separating them by brands
[48:39] last year billy had regarded the fall
[48:41] roundup as the most exciting thing he
[48:43] had ever done
[48:44] but this year he was troubled by that
[48:47] same uneasiness that had dogged him all
[48:49] summer
[48:50] what was wrong
[48:52] when evening came on the trail billy
[48:54] slipped the saddle off his horse and set
[48:56] it near the campfire for a pillow
[48:58] after supper he leaned back against his
[49:00] saddle to watch the sun dip behind the
[49:02] mountains flinging brilliant orange pink
[49:05] and red streamers into the sky
[49:08] an old texan named slim tuned his guitar
[49:11] each night slim serenaded the desert
[49:14] with cowboy ballads accompanied by
[49:15] another cowboy who blew through a comb
[49:18] making a piece of paper was in harmony
[49:21] slim sang
[49:23] last night as i lay on the prairie i
[49:25] gazed at the stars in the sky
[49:28] and i wondered if ever a cowboy could
[49:31] drift to that sweet by-and-by
[49:34] there's a road to that bright happy
[49:36] region and the trail there is dim so
[49:38] they say
[49:39] but the broad one that leads to
[49:41] perdition
[49:42] is posted in blaze all the way
[49:45] they speak of another great owner and
[49:47] he's never overstocked so they say
[49:50] he'll always make room for a center
[49:53] that'll drift on the narrow
[49:55] straight way
[49:56] they say he will never forsake you
[49:59] and he knows every action and look
[50:02] for safety we'd better get branded
[50:04] have our name on his great tally book
[50:07] for they say there will be a great
[50:09] roundup when cowboys like doggies will
[50:12] stand
[50:13] to be marked by the writers of judgment
[50:15] who are posted and know every brand
[50:19] i guess i will be a stray yearling
[50:22] just a man that's condemned to die
[50:24] i'll be cut in the bunch with the
[50:26] rusties
[50:27] when the boss of those riders comes by
[50:32] billy understood what the words of the
[50:34] ballot implied
[50:36] stray yearlings were unbranded cattle
[50:38] that ended up as soup meat
[50:40] and what about that great owner with
[50:42] this tally book
[50:44] billy wondered if that could be what was
[50:46] troubling him was it something to do
[50:48] with god
[50:50] slim strummed another tune this time at
[50:52] old church hymn
[50:54] down at the cross where my savior died
[50:58] down where for cleansing from sin i
[51:00] cried
[51:01] there to my heart was the blood applied
[51:04] glory to his name
[51:06] listening to that slow lingering melody
[51:08] billy felt a distinct ache in his heart
[51:11] he turned over and pulled the blanket up
[51:13] around his head leaving just enough
[51:15] space for his eyes and nose
[51:17] the stars seemed so close as though they
[51:19] were pasted just above the mountains in
[51:22] the everlasting whisper of the breeze
[51:24] through the pine trees billy imagined he
[51:26] heard god calling him as he had called
[51:29] his first son gone astray
[51:31] adam adam where art thou
[51:34] after three weeks the roundup ended
[51:37] the cowboys headed back to the ranch to
[51:39] get their paychecks and to read their
[51:40] mail
[51:41] billy had a letter waiting from his
[51:43] mother postmarked a few weeks earlier
[51:47] among the other bits of news she
[51:48] mentioned that edward was very sick
[51:51] billy took it lightly supposing his
[51:52] brother had a cold or the flu
[51:55] that afternoon all the cowboys drove
[51:57] down from phoenix to celebrate
[51:59] although billy did not feel as festive
[52:01] as the others he tagged along for the
[52:03] change of scenery
[52:05] when the ranch hands filed into a saloon
[52:07] billy wandered off down the street by
[52:09] himself
[52:10] his heart still felt trouble
[52:12] what was wrong
[52:14] he definitely was not homesick he loved
[52:16] arizona loved the desert and enjoyed his
[52:19] work
[52:20] but somehow he still felt hollow inside
[52:22] incomplete
[52:23] he could not figure it out
[52:25] he sat for a while watching the traffic
[52:28] a pretty little spanish girl strolled by
[52:30] fluttered her eyelashes at him and
[52:32] dropped her white handkerchief
[52:34] billy his thoughts elsewhere said
[52:37] hey you dropped your hanky
[52:39] the girl picked it up and continued
[52:40] walking
[52:42] billy heard some
[52:43] music coming from farther down the
[52:45] street he followed the sound until he
[52:47] came to an empty rodeo arena
[52:49] there next to the bucking stalls an old
[52:51] cowboy was strumming a guitar and
[52:53] singing
[52:54] down at the cross where my savior died
[52:57] down wherefore cleansing for sin i cried
[53:00] there to my heart was the blood applied
[53:03] glory to his name
[53:05] but this cowboy sang with more feeling
[53:07] than slim did on the prairie this man
[53:10] sang to him
[53:11] like he meant it
[53:13] tears were running down his pockmarked
[53:15] cheeks at the end of the chorus he
[53:17] turned to billy and said brother
[53:19] you don't know what it is until you
[53:21] receive this wonderful jesus christ
[53:24] and he sang the chorus again glory to
[53:26] his name
[53:27] billy pulled his hat down and walked
[53:29] away
[53:30] his heart churned with inexpressible
[53:32] feelings
[53:33] by the time billy wandered back to the
[53:35] saloon his fellow ranch hands were
[53:37] laughing uproariously
[53:39] shooting at one another's toes to make
[53:41] each other dance betting each other five
[53:44] dollars they could walk a straight line
[53:46] and every one of them so drunk they had
[53:48] trouble staying on the sidewalk
[53:50] billy herded all of them into the car
[53:52] and drove them back to wickenburg
[53:55] the next morning when bill entered the
[53:56] mess hall he was given a note that said
[53:59] bill come out to the north pasture very
[54:01] important
[54:04] pop an old lone star ranger was waiting
[54:07] for him by the corral gate
[54:10] i am afraid i have bad news for you pop
[54:11] said
[54:13] he handed billy a telegram that read
[54:15] your brother edward died last night
[54:18] come home at once
[54:20] the news stunned him it was the first
[54:23] death he had experienced in his
[54:24] immediate family
[54:26] he turned away from pop and looked out
[54:28] across the yellow sun parts prairie
[54:30] tears running down his cheeks
[54:32] he thought of how hard life had been for
[54:34] the two of them as boys going to school
[54:37] without enough clothes on without school
[54:39] books or paper or pencils
[54:41] and sometimes without enough food to eat
[54:44] then billy remembered stealing that one
[54:46] handful of popcorn from his brother
[54:48] oh if he could only go back and live it
[54:50] over he would never steal such a treat
[54:53] from a poor hungry friend
[54:54] but he couldn't live it again
[54:56] now he couldn't even say he was sorry
[54:59] edward was gone
[55:01] billy wondered if edward was ready to
[55:02] meet god
[55:04] then he the thought struck him how about
[55:06] himself
[55:08] was he ready to meet god
[55:11] billy returned to jeffersonville for the
[55:13] funeral at the conclusion of his sermon
[55:15] reverend mckinney said
[55:17] there may be some here who do not know
[55:19] god if so
[55:21] except him now
[55:24] billy gripped his seat to keep from
[55:26] standing up
[55:27] something strange was tugging at his
[55:29] heart some kind of magnetism he that he
[55:31] didn't understand
[55:32] whatever it was it was making him
[55:34] miserable
[55:36] after the funeral billy planned to go
[55:38] back to arizona but his mother begged so
[55:41] hard for him to stay in indiana that
[55:43] billy finally agreed provided he could
[55:45] find some work
[55:46] soon he landed a job digging ditches to
[55:48] lay gas pipelines for the local public
[55:50] service company public service indiana
[55:53] he decided he would stay in
[55:54] jeffersonville at least for a while
[55:57] snow fell
[55:58] late in the fall of 1929
[56:01] when billy woke up and saw the ground
[56:03] all white and cold he took one of his
[56:05] mother's blankets drove out to the
[56:07] cemetery swept the snow off edward's
[56:09] grave then stretched a blanket over the
[56:11] fresh mound of dirt
[56:13] he wanted edward to be warm
[56:18] in october of 1929 the new york stock
[56:20] market crashed
[56:22] plunging the united states into the
[56:23] worst economic nightmare it had ever
[56:25] seen
[56:26] thousands of banks locked their front
[56:28] doors while the helpless bankers tiptoed
[56:30] out back one step ahead of their angry
[56:32] depositors
[56:34] eventually the great depression touched
[56:35] every area of the economy
[56:38] factories either cut back production or
[56:39] closed entirely farmers tightened their
[56:42] belts or went bankrupt unemployment rose
[56:45] sharply until one out of every four
[56:47] american workers languished in idleness
[56:50] although william branham's job at the
[56:52] jeffersonville public service department
[56:54] paid only 20 cents an hour he considered
[56:57] himself lucky to be working at all he
[56:59] still planned to someday devote his life
[57:01] to fur trapping in the mountains out
[57:03] west but for now his paycheck was needed
[57:05] at home
[57:06] his father's health was failing due to
[57:09] his continued heavy drinking
[57:11] charles branham now 38 years old was not
[57:14] only out of work but his chances of
[57:16] getting a steady job and keeping it were
[57:18] slim
[57:19] on november 2nd 1929 ella branham bore
[57:23] her 10th and last child finally after
[57:27] nine sons
[57:29] finally she had a girl
[57:31] ella named her daughter faye dolores
[57:33] branham
[57:36] but she called her by her middle name
[57:38] so out of the 11 branhams living in one
[57:40] house only billy had full-time
[57:42] employment
[57:43] billy felt an obligation to help support
[57:46] the rest of his family at least for a
[57:48] few more years
[57:50] working for public service indiana
[57:52] agreed with billy's temperament his job
[57:54] kept him outside year round and the task
[57:57] varied from week to week so that he
[57:58] seldom was bored
[58:00] one week he might be digging ditches
[58:02] delay gas mains another week he might be
[58:04] reading meters or repairing gas leaks
[58:09] or climbing power poles to repair
[58:10] electrical transmission lines
[58:13] the only part of hit the job he disliked
[58:15] was turning off the electricity on cons
[58:17] on customers who couldn't pay their
[58:19] bills
[58:20] and with the depression deepening
[58:22] that happened far too often to suit him
[58:26] as glad as billy was for his public
[58:28] service company job still eight dollars
[58:31] a week did not stretch far in a
[58:32] household of 11 people
[58:34] so when he was offered part-time work as
[58:36] a deputy game warden for the state of
[58:38] indiana he jumped at the chance
[58:40] it meant he would get out of town on a
[58:42] regular basis to patrol the backwoods
[58:45] he thought of being paid for doing what
[58:47] he loved to do anyway seemed perfect in
[58:50] reality it never turned out that way
[58:53] his pay was supposed to be a commission
[58:55] on the number of tickets he issued to
[58:57] gain law of violators
[58:59] but billy could never bring himself to
[59:01] write out a ticket
[59:02] he felt that more good could be
[59:04] accomplished by sitting down with a
[59:06] poacher and lecturing him on the
[59:07] benefits of game conservation and the
[59:10] importance of obeying state laws
[59:12] in effect billy ended up donating his
[59:14] time
[59:15] but to him the satisfaction he gained
[59:17] from getting out of town and tramping
[59:19] the wooded countryside was reward enough
[59:22] one day billy was scheduled to patrol
[59:24] henryville state park 20 miles north of
[59:26] jeffersonville
[59:28] as soon as he boarded the greyhound bus
[59:30] a strange feeling swept over him
[59:33] like a pressure almost though some
[59:35] unseen force was pushing against him
[59:38] the bus was crowded passengers filled
[59:40] every seat and many stood in the owl
[59:43] billy jostled to the center of the bus
[59:45] stopping between a hefty middle-aged
[59:47] woman and a sailor
[59:49] the woman looked up and said hello as
[59:51] the bus rolled away from the station
[59:53] billy answered how'd he do
[59:56] and gazed out of the window watching
[59:58] houses glide by that strange force was
[1:00:01] pushing against him more strongly now
[1:00:04] it seemed to be coming from this
[1:00:05] heavyset woman
[1:00:07] out of the corner of his eye
[1:00:09] billy could tell she was staring
[1:00:10] directly at his face
[1:00:12] she made him feel uncomfortable
[1:00:15] soon she started a conversation
[1:00:17] are you an officer
[1:00:20] billy wore his game warden uniform with
[1:00:22] a pistol tucked in a holster at his side
[1:00:24] i'm a conservation officer he returned
[1:00:28] you're lonesome aren't you
[1:00:31] billy mask is surprised no ma'am he lied
[1:00:36] well you're not at your home she said
[1:00:40] i'm at as much of a home as i've got
[1:00:43] she shook her head
[1:00:44] no you were born for the west
[1:00:48] that shocked billy as much as if he had
[1:00:50] poured as she had poured ice water over
[1:00:52] his head
[1:00:53] say what are you talking about she said
[1:00:56] maybe i'd better explain myself you see
[1:00:58] i'm an astrologer
[1:01:01] billy groaned inwardly thinking
[1:01:03] here's another one of the of them funny
[1:01:05] people he moves away from her closer to
[1:01:08] the sailor
[1:01:09] she followed him staggering a little
[1:01:11] with the rocking of the bus
[1:01:13] she said
[1:01:14] i'd like to talk with you a few minutes
[1:01:17] billy kept looking ahead acting like he
[1:01:19] didn't hear her
[1:01:20] she persisted could i speak with you
[1:01:23] just a moment
[1:01:24] billy ignored her he thought this is not
[1:01:27] very gentlemanly of me but i don't want
[1:01:29] to talk to her
[1:01:31] yet the woman would not leave him alone
[1:01:34] say you the conservation officer can i
[1:01:36] speak with you a minute finally billy
[1:01:38] turned and said curtly
[1:01:40] what do you want
[1:01:42] he felt guilty for acting so rude but he
[1:01:45] really did not want to talk with an
[1:01:46] astrologer
[1:01:47] he remembered what that gypsy fortune
[1:01:49] teller had said to him at the carnival
[1:01:51] and the memory made him uneasy
[1:01:53] the woman asked
[1:01:55] are you a christian
[1:01:57] no he snapped
[1:01:59] and what's that to you
[1:02:01] she shrugged oh i just wondered did you
[1:02:04] know that you were born under a sign
[1:02:07] billy swallowed hard
[1:02:09] look lady i don't want to know nothing
[1:02:12] about that c
[1:02:13] i know i'm being short with you but i
[1:02:15] mean it
[1:02:16] i don't want to know nothing about it
[1:02:19] she retreated a little way
[1:02:21] oh don't be so hard
[1:02:23] well i don't mean to hurt your feelings
[1:02:25] but i don't know nothing about any
[1:02:27] religious things and i don't want to
[1:02:29] know
[1:02:30] billy turned away from her and stared
[1:02:32] past the sailor toward the front of the
[1:02:34] bus
[1:02:35] my you shouldn't act like that this has
[1:02:38] nothing to do with religion
[1:02:40] i'm on my road to chicago to see my son
[1:02:42] who is a baptist minister
[1:02:44] i work in the white house
[1:02:46] did you know that the position of the
[1:02:47] stars affects events here on earth
[1:02:50] i know nothing about it billy said
[1:02:53] she said
[1:02:54] there's a sailor standing in front of
[1:02:55] you ask him if the moon doesn't control
[1:02:57] the tides
[1:02:59] i've got sense enough to know that snap
[1:03:01] bill
[1:03:02] the woman continued
[1:03:04] well there are many other heavenly
[1:03:06] bodies that have significance on earth
[1:03:08] if i could tell you exactly when you
[1:03:10] were born would you believe me
[1:03:13] billy frowned uncomfortably
[1:03:16] you can't do it in the first place
[1:03:19] she smiled
[1:03:20] oh yes i can
[1:03:22] you were born on april 6 1909 at five
[1:03:25] o'clock in the morning
[1:03:27] billy's gruff facade crumbled into
[1:03:30] astonishment
[1:03:31] that's right
[1:03:34] now tell this sailor when he was born
[1:03:37] she said i couldn't do it
[1:03:39] you see you were born under a sign
[1:03:42] haven't ministers ever talk to you about
[1:03:44] this
[1:03:45] i have nothing to do with preachers
[1:03:47] nothing at all
[1:03:48] the woman's eyes drifted away for a
[1:03:50] moment as her mind followed that thought
[1:03:53] isn't it strange that preachers wouldn't
[1:03:55] know that
[1:03:57] billy repeated i don't fool around where
[1:03:59] they're at
[1:04:01] she again focus her eyes on him
[1:04:04] look i want to tell you something you
[1:04:06] were born under a sign as a gift to
[1:04:07] mankind
[1:04:09] if you could only recognize it he
[1:04:11] interrupted
[1:04:12] maybe i'll be another daniel boone i
[1:04:15] like to hunt and i was born in kentucky
[1:04:18] no that isn't what i'm talking about
[1:04:21] well maybe i'll be a businessman i've
[1:04:22] got a grammar school education
[1:04:25] she did not seem amused
[1:04:27] that's not what i'm talking about
[1:04:30] i don't know what you'll be but i can
[1:04:32] see by your aura that you were born as a
[1:04:34] gift
[1:04:35] do you remember the story about how the
[1:04:37] wise men were led to a star by the baby
[1:04:39] jesus
[1:04:41] i don't know nothing about religion
[1:04:44] but have you heard about the wise men
[1:04:45] coming to see the baby jesus haven't you
[1:04:48] yes
[1:04:51] well what are
[1:04:52] wise men
[1:04:55] oh they were just wise men that's all i
[1:04:57] know
[1:04:58] she explained
[1:04:59] the wise men were the same thing i am
[1:05:02] they were astrologers star gazers you
[1:05:04] know before god does anything on earth
[1:05:06] he always declares it in the heavens
[1:05:08] first
[1:05:09] that's what he did when jesus was born
[1:05:12] three heavenly bodies lined up and
[1:05:14] formed a conjunction that caught the
[1:05:15] attention of some astrologers living in
[1:05:17] the east
[1:05:18] one of them was from the lineage of ham
[1:05:21] another shem and the other japeth
[1:05:24] the three sons of noah
[1:05:26] they represented all the peoples of the
[1:05:28] earth
[1:05:29] each of these three men traveled west
[1:05:31] separately not knowing the others were
[1:05:33] coming until they met at jerusalem
[1:05:35] then they went to bethlehem and found
[1:05:37] the baby jesus
[1:05:39] they knew jesus was the one they were
[1:05:41] looking for because of the color of his
[1:05:42] aura
[1:05:43] you know what an r is don't you
[1:05:46] it's the supernatural light of the soul
[1:05:48] everyone has an aura they come in
[1:05:50] different colors and each color means
[1:05:51] something
[1:05:52] gold means a gift from god so these
[1:05:56] three wise men worshiped jesus and gave
[1:05:58] him gifts
[1:05:59] they departed just as those three
[1:06:01] heavenly bodies were separating into
[1:06:03] their individual orbits
[1:06:05] in commemoration of the greatest gift
[1:06:07] god ever gave to mankind his own son
[1:06:10] jesus
[1:06:11] every time those three heavenly bodies
[1:06:13] come back in a line
[1:06:15] god sends a lesser gift to man
[1:06:18] you were born at such a conjunction
[1:06:21] you have a gold aura surrounding you
[1:06:23] that's how i know the day and the hour
[1:06:26] of your birth and that's how i know your
[1:06:28] destiny lies in the west
[1:06:31] out of courtesy
[1:06:33] bill had tried to listen patiently but
[1:06:35] by now he had heard enough
[1:06:37] lady all i know is that i'm a game
[1:06:39] warden of indiana and i'm doing the best
[1:06:41] i can i'm not religious and i don't want
[1:06:44] to hear any more about it
[1:06:46] billy moved toward the front of the bus
[1:06:48] putting the sailor between himself and
[1:06:50] the astrologer effectively ending the
[1:06:52] conversation
[1:06:54] still the incident was not easily
[1:06:56] forgotten
[1:06:57] and it troubled his thoughts on more
[1:06:58] than one occasion
[1:07:00] his life seemed so different from most
[1:07:02] people he knew
[1:07:03] but a gift
[1:07:05] what could that mean
[1:07:07] and it was
[1:07:08] and it and what was it about him that
[1:07:11] attracted these strange people the
[1:07:14] fortune teller had said she saw a light
[1:07:16] following him
[1:07:17] this astrologer had called it an aura
[1:07:20] billy couldn't put it could not put it
[1:07:22] together
[1:07:23] the questions tumbled over and around
[1:07:25] his mind like cream in a butter churn
[1:07:27] why was he so different
[1:07:30] why he why had he sensed that acute
[1:07:32] pressure as soon as he boarded the
[1:07:34] greyhound bus
[1:07:36] and why was he so miserable when the
[1:07:38] subject of religion came up
[1:07:40] was he afraid
[1:07:42] maybe god was looking for him
[1:07:45] and he was trying to hide
[1:07:47] and what did that woman mean which he
[1:07:49] said his destiny lay in the west
[1:07:53] god bless you
[1:07:59] amen let's give the lord jesus christ a
[1:08:01] clap offering
