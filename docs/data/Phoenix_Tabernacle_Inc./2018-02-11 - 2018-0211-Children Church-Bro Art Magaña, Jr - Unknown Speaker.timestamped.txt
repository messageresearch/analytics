[16:36] yes depending upon the masses our
[16:38] cientos you all look very beautiful this
[16:41] evening those meat annoy the most honest
[16:43] that badly I just like to share a small
[16:45] a small little testimony with you must
[16:49] get a compartir don't testimony oppa
[16:51] Kenya I think it's about seeing the Lord
[16:55] and all things that we do part Anessa de
[16:58] red el Senor es todos que somos it's
[17:01] really simple is moisten see you so so
[17:04] Saturday sabalo so on Saturday we went
[17:16] hiking and we were up at 24th Street in
[17:20] South Mountain how many of you like to
[17:22] go hiking anybody a man right you get
[17:25] some exercise in there I don't I don't
[17:28] like to go hiking but I do it anywhere
[17:31] hey so we were going hiking and I had my
[17:36] son Ethan with me and my wife sister
[17:39] Eunice and sister Brenda were also with
[17:44] me and we let sister Eunice and sister
[17:48] Brenda go
[17:48] go ahead of us and me and Ethan where
[17:50] were trailing behind and I used the
[17:53] excuse well you know I'll hang out with
[17:55] Ethan and that way he's not by himself
[17:57] because he he goes a little bit slower
[17:59] right but it's really me right so as so
[18:04] as we started hiking you know this trail
[18:06] it's a trail that starts off like the
[18:11] first 20 feet it's it's easy but after
[18:15] that everything is uphill through rocks
[18:18] and it's it's not very far it's about a
[18:23] mile up and a mile down
[18:26] but it's so steep that it really gets
[18:28] your heart pumping I mean to an extreme
[18:32] right you go from let's say 75 beats a
[18:36] minute to a hundred and fifty beats a
[18:38] minute right Riley sided without i watch
[18:41] that my children bought me and I was
[18:45] talking with Ethan and thinking thinking
[18:49] I said you know this is this is a good
[18:51] time to to talk to my son about about
[18:54] how God is in all things and as I
[18:57] started as I started to meditate on on
[19:01] us going up the trail I noticed one
[19:04] thing that there was a provided way for
[19:07] us right a provided way for us to go up
[19:10] the trail safely so I I began to share
[19:15] with my son how when we follow Jesus
[19:20] Jesus provides a way for us and it's the
[19:25] easiest way to victory that's possible
[19:29] right and and the simplicity of that is
[19:33] is amazing right because you know we say
[19:36] to ourselves or we say towards those
[19:38] children well how do I follow Jesus we
[19:42] just have to follow Jesus so as we're
[19:45] going up the trail I noticed that that
[19:47] that getting there was the easy part
[19:50] but there was it was still tough right
[19:52] you're sitting at home on a Saturday and
[19:54] you have to make a decision kind of like
[19:57] sometimes we have to do with choosing to
[20:00] do the right things we're sitting there
[20:03] sometimes and the right thing is right
[20:07] in front of us and maybe it's not the
[20:10] easiest thing to do maybe it's gonna
[20:13] take some effort maybe it's going to
[20:16] make us uncomfortable but if we do it
[20:20] then we understand that we're following
[20:22] God's provided way so that's how the
[20:25] hike started out so as we started hiking
[20:26] like I said it was it was pretty hard
[20:29] huh we got about a third of a mile up
[20:33] and we stopped to drink water and we're
[20:36] like oh man
[20:36] this is pretty tough alright so I
[20:40] started to tell you that I said you know
[20:42] I said as Christians when we're
[20:44] following Jesus it's not the easiest
[20:48] thing to do and sometimes we get tired
[20:50] and sometimes we want to quit right
[20:52] we're like man why don't we turn around
[20:53] right and just head down right we can
[20:57] even run down you know but you know I
[21:01] told you that no we got a we got to
[21:03] continue to go so as we continue to go
[21:05] up the trail and I was telling you that
[21:08] said you know Ethan I said it's so
[21:10] amazing that God provides us a way to
[21:12] follow I said and it's not easy and it's
[21:15] not hard and sometimes we get tired and
[21:17] sometimes we want to stop and maybe we
[21:20] want to turn around because we think
[21:21] it's easier to go back to where we came
[21:24] from than to continue up following Jesus
[21:28] I said that we just have to keep going
[21:33] so so we would drink a little bit water
[21:35] we stop and we we look around and we see
[21:37] the beautiful view we say okay let's go
[21:39] so once we got up a little bit farther
[21:42] probably about halfway up I told I was
[21:44] telling and said Ethan you know there's
[21:47] a lot of ways up here that appeared to
[21:49] be little trails where we think that we
[21:53] may be able to go off into one of these
[21:55] little shortcuts I said did you know
[21:57] though that these little shortcuts as
[22:00] you start going through these places
[22:02] that aren't trails you're gonna trip on
[22:04] a rock and possibly hurt your foot
[22:07] you're going to get cut by the bushes or
[22:10] or or or the trees that are out there
[22:12] and if you're not careful you can even
[22:17] maybe disturb a rattlesnake and get bit
[22:21] by a snake which is pretty as I was
[22:25] tying the Sunday School class this
[22:26] morning when brother al you get bit by a
[22:28] rattlesnake there's a good chance that
[22:30] you might not make it right
[22:32] yeah Bradl snakes are very poisonous I
[22:35] said so if you so as I started thinking
[22:39] as I was telling this teeth and I said
[22:41] man I said isn't it amazing how God is
[22:44] in everything he is here teaching us
[22:47] about following him as were hiking up
[22:50] and
[22:50] moong and he's telling us to stay on
[22:54] God's provided path and what is God's
[22:57] provided path it's his word
[23:00] the simplicity of that right well you
[23:03] know you have all these questions well
[23:04] maybe I should do this maybe I should do
[23:06] that or maybe I should go this where
[23:08] maybe I should go that way
[23:09] stay on God's provided way right and
[23:13] sometimes that's not the easiest thing
[23:16] to do but if we go off the path then we
[23:21] run into danger and we run into things
[23:24] that are unknown and that's for every
[23:27] aspect no matter how young you are or
[23:29] how old you are there's always a way
[23:33] that seems right but maybe it's not we
[23:36] just gotta follow God's Way and as we
[23:38] were talking we eventually made it to
[23:40] the top right and it was tough and it
[23:43] was tough but we felt really good about
[23:46] it and then I saw and then I began to
[23:48] share with him I said you know did you
[23:53] know that God talks to us if we listen
[23:56] he said what do you mean dad I said well
[23:58] close your eyes son I said listen listen
[24:01] to what he's saying to you and I shared
[24:03] this with the Sunday School class again
[24:05] today I said did you know that God talks
[24:08] to you already as a young person and a
[24:11] lot of them looked at me like man oh
[24:12] really for the mic I said really I said
[24:16] you know that little voice that warns
[24:18] you when there's danger or that tells
[24:20] you not to do something because it's bad
[24:24] for you or you're gonna get yourself in
[24:25] trouble you're gonna do this I said
[24:27] that's the Lord talking to you but you
[24:31] know what we just choose to ignore it
[24:33] sometimes and again it follows us from
[24:35] the time when we're maybe at an ice age
[24:42] through the time when we're eatin sage
[24:46] through my life and on it's that same
[24:49] voice that talks to us and the voice
[24:52] gets louder if we follow the path and if
[24:56] we're obedient to the path right because
[24:59] I started thinking man did did our Lord
[25:01] really make it that difficult for us
[25:04] to serve him know he provided a way we
[25:09] make it difficult because we choose to
[25:12] go off of his path and could you imagine
[25:14] all that I didn't want to go hiking and
[25:16] I learned all of that when I went hiking
[25:18] now I understood a little bit I told you
[25:20] now I understand a little bit Ethan why
[25:22] brother branham used to love to go out
[25:26] where there was nature right he would go
[25:29] out in the wilderness and he would see
[25:30] God in everything that he did
[25:32] so remember boys young ladies got to
[25:37] stay on that path it's not the easiest
[25:39] thing to do sometimes way if you don't
[25:42] understand it and I'm done if you don't
[25:45] understand it what's the safest thing to
[25:48] do stay on the path and the path will
[25:52] take you to where that path was designed
[25:55] to go right and if if our Lord's path to
[25:59] salvation was designed to save us from
[26:04] these horrible times that we live in we
[26:07] just have to stay on the past excuse me
[26:10] on the path and we have to trust him
[26:12] amen
[26:13] so anyway just a little testimony god
[26:14] bless you all would you please stand and
[26:27] join us as we stretch our arms worship
[26:29] the Lord and sing father Abraham so we

[34:53] to be before you this evening now I feel
[34:59] really good today and I wanted to say
[35:01] something but I didn't want it to be
[35:03] sacrilegious maybe as brother Branham
[35:05] says but I feel really good today and I
[35:09] hope that there's another young person
[35:12] out there that feels as good as I do
[35:14] because I want to invite someone that
[35:16] has their Bible that has enough courage
[35:18] to come up here and read a few verses
[35:21] out loud for us is there anybody that
[35:24] one of the young children maybe a boy
[35:26] young girl one or two maybe just one
[35:30] anybody if not I'll read them it's okay
[35:34] okay I'll go ahead and read them so if
[35:38] you don't mind I'm going to ask you to
[35:39] stand one more time as we read the word
[35:42] we're gonna be reading in a few
[35:44] scriptures Matthew 7:7 through 8 and
[35:49] I'll give you a moment to turn in your
[35:51] Bibles
[36:02] the Word of God reads like this
[36:04] Matthew 7:7 through 8 ask and it will be
[36:09] given to you seek and you will find
[36:12] knock and the door will be open to you
[36:15] for everyone that asketh receiveth and
[36:18] he that seeketh findeth and to him that
[36:23] knocketh it shall be opened one more
[36:27] scripture I would like to read mark
[36:29] 11:24 and the Word of God reads
[36:38] therefore I say unto you what things
[36:41] soever ye desire when you pray believe
[36:45] that you receive them and you shall have
[36:48] them we could just bow our heads and we
[36:51] can pray brief prayer Heavenly Father
[36:54] we're so thankful to you this evening
[36:55] Lord for allowing us to gather here and
[36:58] your house Lord of worship we come Lord
[37:01] and expecting to hear from you Lord and
[37:04] I I expect to hear from you as well Lord
[37:06] just want you to take control of the
[37:09] service take control of your humble
[37:11] servant Lord that the word would just be
[37:13] brought forth and it's pureness and in
[37:16] its truth and we ask all this father and
[37:19] the precious name of the Lord Jesus
[37:20] Christ amen you may be seated so we know
[37:27] that these scriptures are Jesus is Jesus
[37:32] speaking to us and we know that these
[37:35] words are not only the words of Jesus
[37:38] but they're the words of God because
[37:40] inside of Jesus was the fullness of God
[37:43] amen
[37:45] we also know that these words just going
[37:49] over some basics that these words can be
[37:51] found in the Bible correct now just a
[37:55] question how many of you have your
[37:57] Bibles this evening with you that's
[37:59] great wonderful I don't see everybody
[38:02] with the Bible but maybe next time
[38:04] because the Bible is very very important
[38:08] to the Christian it's the textbook for
[38:12] the Christian
[38:13] and I know we have students here that go
[38:15] to school you get textbooks for English
[38:18] you get textbook for math for history
[38:21] for whatever subject now you go to that
[38:24] textbook and you read it you study from
[38:27] it you learning new things you're giving
[38:31] homework assignments that you need to
[38:33] look for in that textbook because you're
[38:36] gonna have the homework assignment like
[38:38] I said you're gonna have a quiz maybe
[38:41] once a month then you'll have the big
[38:43] test probably once a year or so right
[38:46] it's the same way with the Bible the
[38:50] Bible you pick it up you read it you
[38:53] learn from it you're studying it and it
[38:56] gives you the answers to your questions
[38:59] that you might have also when you're an
[39:03] adult you get those adult homeworks you
[39:06] get those adult quizzes and tests to
[39:10] where you need to look in here for the
[39:13] answers you need to know and find you
[39:16] need to know study this read it so that
[39:19] you can find that answer that you're
[39:21] looking for this book also is very
[39:24] important to where it tells you where
[39:27] you came from it tells you where you're
[39:29] going most importantly it tells you who
[39:32] you are this Bible is the very thoughts
[39:36] of God before the foundation of the
[39:39] world he thought them the the words came
[39:43] to the prophets the prophets wrote them
[39:45] down for us so that we can read them so
[39:48] that we could study this Bible that we
[39:49] could listen we could we could study it
[39:52] and we could learn from it these words
[39:56] as I mentioned they're God Almighty
[39:59] Himself for God is his word there's
[40:03] another wonderful feature about this
[40:05] Bible and but before we go there I want
[40:08] to ask how many love promises we love
[40:14] promises Pienaar like if your parent
[40:17] tells you we're going to go have your
[40:18] favorite food after service mmm that's a
[40:21] wonderful promise right maybe if your
[40:24] parents tells you we're going to take
[40:25] you to do
[40:26] and once a year every year what a
[40:29] promising men what about if it was that
[40:32] new gaming system that you really really
[40:35] want or it just came out a promise right
[40:38] but that promise doesn't mean anything
[40:41] if you don't trust the person that's
[40:43] telling you the promise so if parents if
[40:46] you Primus promised your child something
[40:47] you know they're expecting you to
[40:49] fulfill that promise I remember one time
[40:52] I was with my niece and I just had said
[40:54] what do you want to eat french fries
[40:56] yeah french fries and I said well how
[40:59] about spaghetti spaghetti and I couldn't
[41:02] change her mind from spaghetti I learned
[41:05] a big lesson right there
[41:06] make sure I fulfill what I promised I
[41:15] like to look at promises like Christmas
[41:18] gifts like birthday gifts we all love
[41:22] birthday gifts we all love Christmas
[41:23] gifts amen
[41:25] before when brother when brother Bernie
[41:27] was up here he mentioned did we know
[41:29] that the Bible is full of promises
[41:31] that's exactly what I would like to
[41:33] speak about today this Bible is full of
[41:36] promises their gifts their promises but
[41:40] they're not just from anybody they're
[41:43] from our Heavenly Father God Almighty
[41:45] Himself written down for us to study the
[41:49] text book to read them now I want to ask
[41:53] a question these gifts are they just for
[41:57] your mom and your dad good they're not
[42:01] are they just for the Sunday school
[42:03] teacher what about the funny looking guy
[42:08] that stands behind the pulpit sometimes
[42:10] not so much right it's not just for him
[42:13] the promises are not just for him they
[42:16] are for whosoever will believe the
[42:19] promises and not only that but who's
[42:23] telling you the promise you have to
[42:26] believe that God keeps his word for
[42:29] these promises to take effect
[42:31] last week brother Alex was at the
[42:33] Lighthouse and he said a tremendous
[42:34] statement that I loved this book is good
[42:39] for nothing
[42:40] wait for the punchline okay this book is
[42:43] good for nothing if you don't believe it
[42:47] it's not it's good for nothing
[42:49] and I love that greatly whether Branham
[42:53] gives a scenario of because i used the
[42:56] word whosoever he gives a scenario that
[42:58] it's better for whosoever than to have
[43:02] the name william branham in the bible
[43:04] how many have heard that what about if
[43:07] it said art Magana what if it said
[43:11] sister Marguerite Ocampo well there
[43:13] could be two William branham's there
[43:16] could be two Mariotti throw compost how
[43:18] would we know which one that that gift
[43:21] that blessing that promise applied to
[43:24] while it was the two of them how do you
[43:26] know
[43:26] but when brother Branham says it's
[43:28] whosoever will believe that included him
[43:32] that included you that included me amen
[43:36] by a show of hands we where do we
[43:39] believe the word of God amen
[43:41] this Bible we believe it to be God's
[43:43] Word there's a writer who read through
[43:47] the Bible counted all the blessings he
[43:49] wrote down and counted about eight
[43:52] thousand blessings in the Bible so we
[43:55] just called these promises gifts imagine
[43:58] now you opening eight thousand gifts
[44:02] just for you eight thousand gifts that's
[44:06] what this Bible is we said that we
[44:08] believe the promises that are in there
[44:09] am i right so what is that Bernie that's
[44:12] eight thousand gifts for you that's
[44:14] eight thousand gifts for your son that's
[44:16] 8,000 gifts for brother Ernie for sister
[44:18] Hannah eight thousand gifts isn't that
[44:21] tremendous what's more tremendous let's
[44:27] say that we were going to use those
[44:28] eight thousand gifts twice that's
[44:31] sixteen thousand gifts what if we were
[44:34] going to use them ten times 80,000 gifts
[44:38] let's say that we were gonna use them
[44:41] eight thousand times 64 million gifts
[44:46] what a blessing right it's a blessing
[44:49] for us
[44:50] I believe we deserve to give the Lord I
[44:52] had a praise for that
[44:53] [Applause]
[45:02] my point with all this is that it's it's
[45:06] just not a one and done type blessing
[45:09] it's not a one and done type gift or
[45:12] promise now you might ask yourself
[45:14] brother Hart how do you know that
[45:15] anybody asks yourself though well if not
[45:19] I'm glad you're asking I want to go to
[45:21] Ephesians 3:8 now you have to forgive me
[45:24] because I didn't use the Kings James
[45:26] Version on this I used the New Living
[45:29] Translation verse that I thought that
[45:32] was really really hitting the point of
[45:35] what I was trying to trying to get
[45:37] across that these gifts you can use them
[45:40] once you can use them twice or eight
[45:43] thousand times
[45:44] so it's Ephesians 3:8 and I said this is
[45:48] the new translation version though I am
[45:52] the least deserving of all God's people
[45:55] he graciously gave me the pleasure of
[45:58] telling the Gentiles about the endless
[46:01] treasures available to them that
[46:05] believed in Christ amen isn't that
[46:09] beautiful
[46:09] that's the Apostle Paul who wrote that
[46:12] in Ephesians the endless treasures
[46:14] available to them in Christ now we're
[46:18] gonna take this a little bit farther
[46:19] okay I appreciate you guys working with
[46:22] me without an interpreter I have a
[46:26] quoted sentence here that kind of made
[46:29] my seem a little bit more narrow and if
[46:32] you don't remember anything tonight
[46:34] please remember this this is the one
[46:37] thing I asked that you remember it's a
[46:41] quoted sentence from the message
[46:43] perfection that was preached in 1956 and
[46:46] it states if God promised it God has to
[46:51] take care of his promise now I want you
[46:54] to repeat that with me because I don't
[46:56] want you to forget remember after me if
[46:58] God promised it
[47:01] God has to take care of his promise now
[47:08] what does that mean you want to come up
[47:11] here and try cool what does that mean it
[47:16] means God cannot lie whatever is written
[47:20] in this Bible is 100% the truth you can
[47:25] count on it done you don't need to buy
[47:28] the warranty on it for that for it not
[47:30] lasting its shelf life or it
[47:33] malfunctioning or anything like that no
[47:35] warranty needed this is guaranteed 100%
[47:38] gonna happen
[47:40] but why because God promised it he's
[47:45] gonna promise it to come through that's
[47:47] as simple as it is I I've been under the
[47:52] teaching of the message in my parents
[47:55] for over 35 years and I can think about
[47:58] brother or anyone he says how simple the
[48:01] messages and I think back over my life
[48:04] and I hear the the certain quotes and
[48:06] the certain phrases that we say all the
[48:08] time that we take for granted like the
[48:11] song standing on the promises what does
[48:13] that mean
[48:13] we sing about it all the time that's
[48:15] what that means standing on the promises
[48:17] I shall not be moved from the promises
[48:21] from the Word of God I'm not going to be
[48:23] shaken hold to God's unchanging hand he
[48:27] never lies the word will come true
[48:29] because he said so because God promised
[48:32] it brother Branham tells us how could
[48:39] God ever take back one of his words this
[48:43] is awesome it would be easier for all
[48:46] the stars to vanish in the sky the Sun
[48:49] the Moon the earth but God's Word will
[48:53] never pass away cannot ever fail it's
[48:57] eternal it's forever amen now I want to
[49:01] give you some Bible examples where I
[49:04] believe that the people from the Bible
[49:07] of the characters use this sentence use
[49:09] this phrase so in Noah's time we know
[49:12] that God visited Noah and
[49:15] that it was gonna rain that there was
[49:17] gonna be a flood so Noah didn't keep
[49:20] that to himself he told the people and
[49:22] the people would tell him what's wrong
[49:24] with you
[49:25] it's gonna rain it's gonna flood how is
[49:28] that gonna happen what didn't know what
[49:30] did Noah tell him God promised it God
[49:34] has to take care of his promise
[49:36] same thing with Abraham I'm 100 years
[49:39] old
[49:40] my wife is 90 years old he had a
[49:42] conversation with God he just didn't
[49:44] keep it to himself and the promise was
[49:46] he was gonna have a son he told the
[49:48] people I'm gonna have a son I'm gonna
[49:50] have a son
[49:52] what did how did Abraham reply back to
[49:56] them God promised it God has to take
[50:00] care of his promise now you might be
[50:02] thinking okay brother arts okay we heard
[50:06] about know already we've already heard
[50:08] about a brown how long ago was that what
[50:13] about me today in 2018 how can I use
[50:17] this today in 2018 have you asked
[50:21] yourself that question yes sir if we
[50:27] believe this word to be the truth
[50:30] believe it to be God there is a simple
[50:33] verse in the Bible again that we hear
[50:35] all the time
[50:36] Hebrews 13:8 Amen Jesus Christ the same
[50:40] yesterday today and forever but we have
[50:45] five senses in our body five senses in
[50:47] our spirit but only one inside the soul
[50:50] it either beliefs or it disbeliefs it
[50:54] doubts it doubts this so if we can take
[50:58] that word Jesus Christ the same
[51:01] yesterday today and forever apply it
[51:03] inside our heart that word is just as
[51:07] powerful just as great today as it ever
[51:11] was
[51:11] if we have Christians sitting here today
[51:14] that believed the word as that the gifts
[51:17] the promises that are here become
[51:20] manifested in our day 2018 let
[51:26] see if this works okay in 2018 is there
[51:29] anybody that's ever been sick a broken
[51:31] bone backache headaches there's a lot of
[51:35] hands that are going up everybody's head
[51:37] should go up we've had something or
[51:39] along the lines of that we just learned
[51:42] that inside this book inside this
[51:44] textbook of the christian's
[51:45] there's promises now we're going to look
[51:48] inside now and see if we could find
[51:49] actually a promise that applies to I'm
[51:53] sick I'm not feeling well I have a
[51:55] headache we're gonna turn into Psalms
[52:00] 103 verses 2 & 3 I don't read it for you
[52:05] if you don't you don't have it there
[52:08] bless the Lord O my soul forget not all
[52:13] his benefits who forgiveth all thine
[52:16] iniquities who healeth all thy diseases
[52:20] now that one is not just the single that
[52:23] one's a double you made it the second
[52:24] base on that one closer to closer to
[52:27] home because he forgiveth all your
[52:29] iniquities and he'll athough your
[52:31] diseases let's try another one here how
[52:35] many have you ever been scared or afraid
[52:38] worried or stressed I remember I was
[52:42] thinking and I wasn't as I was
[52:44] meditating I was thinking I used to
[52:46] share a room with my brother when we
[52:47] were younger
[52:48] and we would go home and I would tell
[52:51] him oh I'm so afraid to die Josh I'm so
[52:55] afraid to die and I thought about it
[52:57] eyes were in the world did I get that
[52:59] that I was gonna die probably from the
[53:01] minister or something that's Sunday when
[53:02] I was hiding underneath the bench they
[53:05] were telling me you're gonna die you're
[53:06] gonna die oh my god no I don't want to
[53:08] die Lord I was afraid I was scared I
[53:12] thought I would I thought I would die so
[53:15] I have let's see if we can find a
[53:16] promise inside the word that helps us
[53:19] with that if we're ever afraid if we're
[53:20] ever scared for ever scared at any point
[53:23] I'm gonna look through Psalms 46 one I
[53:29] find one there and that one is God is
[53:33] our refuge and strength a very present
[53:36] help in the time of trouble
[53:39] take the promise if you believe this
[53:42] word take that promise it works today in
[53:45] 2018 there's one more proverbs 30 35
[53:51] proverbs 35 every word of God is pure he
[54:01] is a shield unto them that put their
[54:04] trust in him
[54:06] isn't that beautiful and so simple just
[54:09] like when you believe your mom or your
[54:11] dad or somebody that tells you we're
[54:12] going to Disneyland
[54:13] you're already packing right put your
[54:16] trust in him he will be your shield he
[54:20] will heal you from your diseases he will
[54:22] forgive you from your iniquities working
[54:25] today in 2018 and I know that there's
[54:28] many that can come up here and testify
[54:30] of that this evening I'm not the only
[54:32] one
[54:34] one more okay then we'll take too much
[54:38] more time I have a lot of complexes I
[54:43] like to think at not a lot I like to
[54:45] think I have a lot of complexes but and
[54:47] a lot of the times I'm guilty of saying
[54:49] I can't do that I can't do that I'm not
[54:52] gonna be able to do that coming in and
[54:55] understanding and my eyes being open I
[54:58] know that I need the textbook there's
[55:01] been a lot of times where I say that to
[55:03] myself I can't I can't if there's
[55:06] anybody that has that has ever happened
[55:07] to there's a promise for you there
[55:11] Philippians 4:13
[55:14] I would like to turn there and that
[55:20] reads I can do all things through Christ
[55:25] who strengthens me and I want to read
[55:30] one more in that regards mark 9:23
[55:42] Jesus said unto them if thou canst
[55:44] believe all things are possible to them
[55:48] that believeth now that's the icing on
[55:51] the cake we're talking about we need
[55:54] healing of our body for sick if we're
[55:57] scared but here Jesus is telling me it
[56:00] doesn't matter what you need because all
[56:02] things that are in your hand in your
[56:06] hand if you can just believe I think
[56:10] that's beautiful I think we we all
[56:13] sometimes overlook how good God truly is
[56:15] to us and the one thing I've always had
[56:19] a trouble with is why are all these
[56:21] promises to me why are all these
[56:24] promises to you
[56:25] it's another simple reason because
[56:28] you're a child of the king isn't that
[56:31] wonderful
[56:32] you're a son or daughter of God now I
[56:36] would this is where I've always had
[56:38] trouble so I would love for you boys to
[56:40] repeat after me
[56:42] man brothers repeat after me I am a son
[56:49] of God sisters I am a daughter of God
[56:56] you could never say that enough you
[57:00] could never think that enough that that
[57:03] those words are so powerful they've been
[57:05] so powerful to me just the mere thoughts
[57:09] of it I like the the ability to say them
[57:15] because I feel that I'm not worthy but
[57:19] God makes you worthy it's hard to accept
[57:24] it though but I'm here to tell you this
[57:26] evening that this Bible God Almighty
[57:29] is real he his word is truth it never
[57:33] will fail you give it a shot
[57:35] one time give it a shot be courageous
[57:39] take one of these scriptures take it or
[57:43] wherever you go just repeat it in your
[57:45] head all the time if there's something
[57:47] that you need I can guarantee you that
[57:49] God's Word will not fail you
[57:52] these are God's given privileges to each
[57:58] and every one of us the Son of God the
[58:00] daughter of God whoever will believe in
[58:03] him now there was a there's a phrase
[58:09] that brother Branham always says and it
[58:11] always impacted me when I was since I
[58:13] was young stir and I always remember
[58:15] seeing it in text and it's always
[58:18] capitalized throughout the message and I
[58:21] wonder why was it always capitalized
[58:23] what is what is so striking about that
[58:25] the phrase is thus saith the Lord now
[58:30] those words still have an impact on me
[58:32] now but when I was younger it stood out
[58:35] to me and I didn't know why and so I
[58:38] started to think about it a little bit
[58:39] more and what was amazing to me is that
[58:42] there's no other ground that we can
[58:45] stand on no other motion that makes us
[58:48] move forward then thus saith the Lord
[58:51] where do we see the saith the Lord
[58:54] brother Branham always had it when he
[58:55] was saying a vision to heal a certain
[58:57] person that was right there in front of
[58:59] him that was his thus saith the Lord the
[59:01] vision where is our vision in 2018 right
[59:06] here this Bible is thus saith the Lord
[59:10] let me talk let me show you what I mean
[59:13] thus saith the Lord with His stripes I
[59:16] am healed thus saith the Lord he is my
[59:20] shield thus saith the Lord resist the
[59:24] devil and he will flee thus saith the
[59:27] Lord draw nigh to God and He will draw
[59:29] nigh to you thus saith the Lord God will
[59:33] supply all my needs according to his
[59:35] riches in glory thus saith the Lord cast
[59:39] all your cares on him because he cares
[59:41] for you thus saith the Lord greater is
[59:44] He that's in you than he is in the world
[59:46] thus saith the Lord I will always be
[59:50] with you even until the end of the world
[59:53] see how powerful that is not this is see
[59:57] how powerful this is
[59:59] we just said that these were the words
[1:00:01] of Jesus these were the Word of God it's
[1:00:03] dust
[1:00:04] saith the Lord you have thus saith the
[1:00:07] Lord
[1:00:07] right here to you in closing I've heard
[1:00:13] my pastor in many ministers share this
[1:00:16] many times that you have to identify
[1:00:20] yourself here in the Bible as I
[1:00:25] mentioned it's been hard for me to do
[1:00:27] that to put my name in somewhere here
[1:00:30] that were I can get a blessing from it
[1:00:32] that's been hard for me I'm going to
[1:00:33] admit that to you so there's been a few
[1:00:37] times where I've asked God Lord I need
[1:00:41] you right now I need an answer right now
[1:00:47] I've had it I've had a message at on my
[1:00:50] phone I just hit it and something would
[1:00:54] come to me was the answer to my question
[1:00:57] the the need that I needed so it wasn't
[1:01:01] a week or two after my dad had passed
[1:01:03] away that I needed to get back into the
[1:01:06] root the routine of things going to work
[1:01:09] taking care of the house doing the
[1:01:12] normal things that you know everyday
[1:01:14] life needed to continue and my dad
[1:01:18] always taught us continue with those
[1:01:20] things
[1:01:21] don't ever stop continue you got to keep
[1:01:23] moving forward but this was my dad and
[1:01:26] you know he just passed away so I'm
[1:01:28] thinking how in the world am I gonna
[1:01:30] continue forward Who am I gonna talk to
[1:01:33] Who am I gonna go to my dad was the
[1:01:40] example of Jesus Christ in our household
[1:01:46] he was the example to me so anything
[1:01:50] that I needed I always could go to him
[1:01:52] but it was gone where would I go
[1:01:55] so I had a CD just playing I don't think
[1:01:59] I press play it just automatically went
[1:02:01] on and it was the the mighty war the
[1:02:05] great warrior Joshua the very beginning
[1:02:08] of the tape he reads brother Branham
[1:02:11] reads Joshua three seven now this is a
[1:02:15] testimony that this word
[1:02:17] works in this day 2018
[1:02:20] I heard that tape God is my witness
[1:02:23] because this is what happened this is
[1:02:26] the way I think about it brother Branham
[1:02:29] was what had a person here in front of
[1:02:32] them telling them what their needs were
[1:02:34] deserting their heart that was God in
[1:02:37] motion and it was being recorded for us
[1:02:40] to hear
[1:02:41] that's a supernatural event being
[1:02:44] recorded for us to hear I believe that
[1:02:48] that tape those words if it's on mp3 if
[1:02:51] it's on a reel-to-reel it doesn't matter
[1:02:53] what it's on supernatural power is you
[1:02:57] hear that it's a blessing so the Lord
[1:03:02] spoke to me do that do that tape and it
[1:03:05] was just a little verse Joshua three
[1:03:08] seven and it's at the end of it and I
[1:03:11] was just going about my normal and
[1:03:12] thinking like I told you how am I gonna
[1:03:14] do this how is this gonna work what's
[1:03:16] gonna happen so I heard the tape as I
[1:03:20] was with your dad so shall I be with
[1:03:25] thee working in 2018 I was so so
[1:03:31] thankful to God so humbled but then I
[1:03:35] thought to myself that's not just for me
[1:03:36] that's where my brother
[1:03:38] that's for my niece that's for my mom is
[1:03:41] for my wife
[1:03:42] that's where my children that's for
[1:03:45] whosoever will believe these words just
[1:03:50] like when it comes to be repenting and
[1:03:52] being baptized you have to accept the
[1:03:55] promise because the promise is unto you
[1:03:58] and your children as many as our Lord
[1:04:01] our God shall call if you'll stand with
[1:04:04] me I want to pray so we can just we
[1:04:08] could give honor and glory to the Lord
