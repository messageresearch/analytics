you don't mind the guys at the back if you can start the slideshow let's go to slide one see come in second a presentation la primera awesome so so we're gonna be talking about fruits of the spirit a bloody fruto de los suspiros love you do you love fruits like bananas strawberries mango na papaya we're not we're not gonna talk about those fruits though no Messiah it's just fruit were particularly we're gonna talk about the fruits of the spirit sometimes I lost through to the last video do you know what those are so I look you we just read on let's go to slide two at home was a little icy moon up antalya alright so the first fruit is love the pre-medical I'm not the second is joy peace patience paciencia kindness Wanda goodness faithless fidelito gentleness up a simile and self-control a domino pop propio so these are gonna be a little bit of different fruits than the ones you buy at Fry's on 24th Street okay and today it says put at the cinema no more it's all about you know see for you where are sprouts right okay well our fruits as Christians they're in the Bible mrs. Bruce come o Christian sister Naomi okay and so if you don't mind going to slide three let their self on tire thank you so so Galatians so well that's written voice created by Apostle Paul poor Aleppo soap bubble okay he talks about virtues elaborate Dale as we do this Zack come from Christians k-pro vienen de los Cristina is living piston bebiendo with the Holy Spirit in their hearts on El espíritu Santo ensue callosum see the Holy Spirit when it's planted in us bailey spiritus on tokens Eglinton assad roses they produce these fruit system produces frutos which were the nine fruits that we just talked about quality knows no fruit to sell equality into numbers kind of like kind of like a real seed and a real like a real tree yeah exactly like like an apple tree you know your brother branham and the man who talks about an apple tree a level of the lad with a lemon sana how the apple tree is it comes it comes from a Cedars once the Cedars an apple seed kamal elaborate elements and universe run SME elements on it and and just like any seed in comic what gets in me and we have to feed it tenemos que right water sign yeah you gotta know yeah what slips let me ask you something Lazarus nobody won't tell what if what if you took a seat Gacy tomato fulness and man you watered it with dr. pepper he loved oh sorry garkon lovely be that it would taste good they always hold but it wouldn't grow no right what if what if we gave it doctor or diet dr. pepper silly them was not gonna know yet still no right okay good nothing diet no no nothing that so so now we understand that a seed to grow right out in tenemos que una cement a para que Crees que bien to produce good fruit but a producido in fruit on we need to feed it no tenemos que Lehman life with the right things right let's causes correct us okay so so it's in Galatians in galletas 5 16 17 Cinco de si say this is CA Paul advises us borrow no second second to let the Holy Spirit guide our life Kaleigh big Achilles spirit to some dogie and there's Vedas he talks about a el habla cerca he talks about a battle like flu and Ninja Turtles and PJ masks no no no nothing like that it's more like a like a spiritual battle mask Emunah what is petite tall that's inside of us we know like a fruit fight it's it's a it's a battle it's an event I mean the holy spirit internet espíritu santo and our sinful nature in a naturalistic aminos so the holy spirit throws fruit at my sinful nature no no no okay so so it's it's virtues that we can live by some Beatles por la cual podemos really good virtues well as bit that comes from Christians viene de los Christian that allows the Holy Spirit to live inside them okay pyramidical Espiritu Santo be Bonet use I wish I knew of virtues meant okay well we're gonna get into them actually OD Thomason Tennyson we're gonna we're gonna skip the first one real quick but what's up love okay and and it's gonna be for a good reason cuz we're gonna leave that to the end I must've had a more I'm all Restylane FINA it's gonna it's gonna tie in all the fruits so let's go to slide 5 I like into bump-ty yeah nice we're gonna talk about joy mama said let available so do you know what joy joy joy joy joy down in my hi that's a good song that's a really good songs and when you know why do you think that why do you think you sing that por qué piensas que lo campus because I'm happy okay that's so very happy that's what the song says that's really good um let's let's turn to first John one for from another cuando cuatro and any reason I kiss ladies Amanita and these things write we unto you that your joy may be filled its us cause us all scribbles but I came West Robbo so sir complete oh so so so this means is too significant that the Bible was actually written he lobelia irrelevant if we script to bring us joy for a try no salvo so ok now Lazarus as Christians our last Roman Christian knows we believe that the Bible trio mas que la vía is God is dios okay and and if this is God you see Esther Wow so that book is actually God yeah yeah so so once we understand that this is God yeah : tenemos que estés Dios and the Bible was written to give us joy 11f excreta para dar no salvo so then we should probably read our Bible until tomorrow after the video was a little a baby so that way we can get joy caught up with it obtain it and also I'm not worthy you can trash no you can read your Bible is it's there for you I said Lavinia particular layer that's a big book well it might be pretty big he saw system poco gravity but that means that there's a bunch of Joy's in here but else isn't it because little wool so I II but I must experiment you so so if we can read our Bibles he put them on the Aaron assertivv as Christians will learn comic Luciano's I bring the rim of the Rose Bowl so that God has for it if you see any para nosotros okay so let's go to slide six and let's say that was the second fruit okay for it Segundo fruit now the third fruit we're gonna say about peace I'm ready almost a pass what do you what do you think about when I say Gibbons is called illegal box piece of pizza one time me and brother Chris got in a fight oh no and sister Patricia made us have a peace treaty oh okay that's actually really good because some we being I have a restraining order on me that's good I beat him in a pillow fight he's weak don't don't say that I mean peace when sister Patricia peace okay so so that's one way of peace it's a Sunnah for mandalas another way otra manera is a peaceful feeling that we have in our hearts as soon as as soon a passive listener for a song so in the beginning of our Bible alchemy and Susanna Sara Vivian it talks about how God created I've read commodious creo all things to a las casas okay and it was good if I win oh okay so God created everything that you see here and this do so creo todo lo que si Becky everything everything everything toe toe toe toe toe okay you can stop looking cuz he created everything bro just trust me yeah they kind of meet up and there was a there was a relationship una realization had kale - whoa between man and the lumbering and himself he'll miss me and and it was good right so a little boy know Adam and Eve Danny ever they felt peace right Cynthia don't bus so when they disobeyed God although this over this year another you that relationship broke is a relation for rota and that means that there was in peace after that significant okay this place - no be a bus so so what do you think happened - what what do you think there was he being systematically or qué piensas kissed about this oh you mean God actually came down and talked to Adam yeah yeah yeah he had a relationship with him then you look at the oil and then the piece was broken yeah yeah because they disobeyed God poor kids over the Sierra not you know but that doesn't mean that there's war right now no kami because I killed I get because porque God wanted to restore that relationship dos caras of Radisson unless you thank God yeah he sent his son olimpio su hijo Jesus Christ is so Kristin to bridge that relationship they our car is a relation that was broken que estaba rota so so God wanted a secure vo skiddy - he knew that the relationship was broken in Sevilla wasn't peace Lala Hsu nest or rotten or via bus but he wanted peace but I will carry a bus right so as a Christian we should como Cristiano we should learn and know the vemos Zeppelin air is aware that Jesus cries kissu Chris was sent for enviado to bring us peace for a triad nosepass Oh Oh light bulb I just made a connection that's why Jesus is the Prince of Peace right that's exactly what we call them the praetorium all my successor principe de la Paz so remember okay as as a Christian we understand that Jesus Christ como Christian tenemos que su Cristo cane be known to restore us but at least our our nose okay he loved us so much was a more detailed manera that he came to to make that relationship right with us be Nikora here Sara Lysenko nosotros so so we need to live test animals KBB by the spirit por el espíritu and and what is the holy spirit you can sell Espiritu Santo the cement in the photos alright so we're gonna go to the next one thank you I can't wait to see the next free well we're gonna get into patience so you might have to wait a little longer to develop and scientist testing a crisp in order to give me patience will give it to me now so I learned to do openly that patients can paciencia it's too way is esperar in God's place and in lieu our videos or at God pace or El Paso videos well that's tough it's tough but let's let's read Psalms 135 to says if he sees problems assalam o siento treinta Cinco says i wait for the lord my soul doth wait and in his word do i hope say espero yo and Yabba espera me arma en su palabra a spell Lazarus did you know that God blesses those who wait la source a mere skinny Osman is ellos esperan I know but ain't nobody got time for that yeah what but don't you agree that we learned that God created all things you know says like what is give your video a little kitty the whole University of Toledo Nevada so yes so she's pretty powerful right so that let's move people there also for that room so if he created all things he'll Creole todo then why wouldn't we wait until porque no esperar na for his time I'll tiempo deal in its perfect time so the end open faked oh that's true even though even though waiting is kind of tough I wanna spit out is if you seal in I said it's it's really waiting on what he wants for us arraignment a esperar and okay I'll hear it but I'm not so hot I learned that Apprendi as a kid come on II know I never wanted away for nothing nunca kid es para ella and she like when there's like a long line for ice cream I know and they do that for end of use getting like eight scrap god so but but my parents would tell me what it means but isn't it cm well wait wait let's let's
