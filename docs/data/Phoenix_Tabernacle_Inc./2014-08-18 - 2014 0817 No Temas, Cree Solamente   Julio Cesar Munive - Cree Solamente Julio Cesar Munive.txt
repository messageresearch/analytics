for oh Lord way amen I I am oh I can't I for oh I I okay I my amen am God bless you Brethren good morning we you in the precious name of the Lord Jesus Christ we're thankful to God for the opportunity that he grants us that we have the life and the health that we can still draw nigh unto him this morning like to thank the ministry the musicians and especially our pastor who's watching us please receive a greeting on his behalf we're happy to be able to be here before you I would like to tell you that we are not any greater than you the same blood that purchased me also purchase your soul the same blood that paid for the price for the prophets is the same blood for us that same blood is the one that cleanses us the one that purifies us this morning we want to submerge ourselves under and beneath that blood we desire that that blood might truly be applied in our lives because truly it's not the blood but the life that's in the blood that's what we desire this morning the life is in him he is life and he has given us life how many can say Amen are you thankful with God are you happy with the life that he's given you are you happy in the way that God made you my brother was laughing and that captures me at times we have to accept ourselves just as we are when I look at myself in the mirror on certain occasions I feel like like slapping myself but I have to accept myself just the way God made me but I ask the Lord please change me help me don't allow me to separate myself from because that is what man does they always run away from God but it's God that searches out his people God was the one that found you brother it was not your father or your mother God found you you must recognize that God was the one that called you God personally called you and he called you by your name and he placed something in your hands and with that that you have in your hand it's sufficient so that you can live through this journey can you believe that I believe that that is sufficient thank you we also want to greet our pastor God bless you and thank you for loving us I believe that our pastor loves us because he's a man that has given his life for the love that he has for the souls the souls don't pertain to man the souls pertain to God and we that have God should manifest that same love unto to man am amen [Music] Breen but at times it's it's difficult to love especially when we're hurt but at times we have to deny our own selves and place ourselves to one side and cast out all those things that do no good to our heart all that root of bitterness and even so be able to love our own enemy thanks be to God for his love we are in Great Expectations young people we're going to be going to that camp meeting please don't don't laugh I know I don't have hair anymore but I still want to be a young man but we're going to go up onto the mountain with the young people we're going to go to a camp meeting this is the 10th anniversary that we celebrate these festivities if we can call it like that where God has done many great things people have been reached God has manifested his mighty [Music] power we've seen God's gifts in operation Above All Things is that God allows us to be able to draw nigh onto himna I'd like to honor our brother Junior Ree and sister Johanna because they're the ones that began with that camp meeting they they deserve all of our respects all of our love for everything that they have done throughout all those many years amen graas thanks be to God also for the presidents that have had those youth governments because it's a lot of work to be done to be able to do those things don't think it's just go and you just get there it's been three years now that the pastor asked us to be able to help in this William Garcia alongside our brother William Garcia and we try to walk in agreement because it's difficult if you're not in agreement the Bible says can two walk if they're not in one Accord so we have to place God first it's not his leadership it's not my leadership but it's the leadership of the Holy Spirit guiding us through our pastor but Allowing God to be in all things number one or first I believe in being Guided by the Holy Spirit at times I have done things that truly I don't even realize that it's God that's leading me because at times we're just so busy that we lose that sensitivity that God is the one speaking or that God is the one leading us but how many believe that God takes care of his children God takes care of his children now what we have to do is take care of God also amen amen because it's it's like a a love relationship man takes care of his wife the wife also takes care of her husband if we lose that [Music] Focus it's time to go back and to be able to take God and tell him forgive me I haven't taken care of you I left you there in the deepest part of the garage but from today on I'm going to take you out of there and I want to place you first I don't want to take a decision on a decision just by myself I want you to decide for me I cannot guide myself I need you to guide me how many are willing to do that amen at times it's difficult to obey that right but it's the best God knows what is the best thing for you if God knows that something's going to kill you he's going to take care of you and and lead you somewhere else but he waits for you to allow yourself to be led is that righten God in the beginning to that first couple he gave him his word and he gave them the warning that the day that you shall eat thereof that day that you touch it that day you shall surely die and that does not change brother continues being the same thing up until today God is faithful to his own word he cannot break it if we let go of all or disobey just one word just as it was there in the beginning God has to come and judge if one day God is going to judge the world in what Manner shall shall he judge it through what church shall he judge it there's no church it has to be through his word that's why it's the word we have to take care of that word if we let go of that word we die but if we get grab a hold of that word we live am amen so then at the end of the month we'll be over there at the camp meeting and our thought for this year is Pentecost as and as a subtitle subth thought as the eagle that stirs her nest that's going to be our thought or our theme this year I'm here and I'd like to talk about that but I'm going to stay still on that this morning we're going to speak on the word of God that's what we've come here for to hear the word of God Amen don't see my mistakes consider that I'm also a human just like you and I make mistakes just like you do but God has placed me here so that I might speak his word and I do it with fear and trembling knowing that there's nothing under my sleeves knowing that there's not a new message that I might be able to bring but only to repeat that which has already been told or said unto us before I [Music] begin I'd like to present a certain person to you it's uh my my sister-in-law my wife had not seen her sister in 14 years she is the eldest of the girls of her home she comes from the capital of Mexico the first time she's been here amongst us my wife has been very very happy all these days almost that I get home every day and I find herself crying I say what you're going to make a flood here in the house but she's crying because she's taking advantage of that time talking about many things but I always find them both crying said we've already ran out of handkerchiefs please don't cry anymore to stand believe that every human being has the right to hear the word of God at least one time amen amen we must give Grace of the grace that we have received let us please stand we're going to pray to God beloved God we thank you this morning report for service Lord we ask you for your leading and your help help us in the little things in life Lord because those are the ones that are going to help us don't allow us to for forget the little things Lord in those little things are found the great things in that smallest flower we can find you Lord in those little things we can find you lord lord what the world calls craziness you call it saying Lord we come before you this in this [Music] moment we've been reached by your preaching Lord Lord and we ask you to place us in our position Lord that you might be able to do your work in US teach us father teach us how to [Music] live teach us everything that we must do and above all things to trust in you completely we as your people we say Amen we love you Lord help us bless our pastor and each person that is here present in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ we pray amen amen God bless his word we're going to be reading I have a a small thought it's difficult to to find that would God wants for the people it's easy to speak on anything but for me it's difficult to find or search out what it is that God wants one to speak on and when I see that which what he brings us the first one that it helps is is myself and I wait on God that God might help you through his word there's no other way that God can help you but through his word amen this morning our thought is fear not only believe we live in a day where mankind is is fearful they're they're they're fearful of anything a man break down hearts are broken the nervousness of mankind being broken up the nations are confused the churches are confused everything is insecurity today you're healed tomorrow you're sick today you have wherewith all tomorrow you don't have anything today you have everything and you can even lose your own life tomorrow but what is the only thing that's a constant the only thing that continues is the word of God he is faithful to his word he doesn't move he does not change his way he continues being the same he says something and he fulfills it you can be so kind to open up your scriptures we're only going to read three verses and you may be seated in the Book of Job 23 verse 1 then job answered and [Music] said even today is my complaint bitter my stroke is heavier than my groaning oh that I knew where I might find him that I might come even to his seat you may be seated thank you Brethren very kind of you truly you are the reason why God has done all these things you are the reason why Jesus Christ came onto this Earth and he paid that price and he took on him the burden you're the most beautiful thing of God's creation the highest life form that God places man His Image you are the reason for God's love you are part of that love of God can you say [Music] Amen but when those difficult things of Life come upon us when those tough Trials come on or those tough Temptations or whenever we fall or stumble or when God wants to truly prove our character and to know what we are truly made of to know if he can truly trust in US because did you know that God is looking out for people that he can trust I know that there have been men that God has lifted up I know that God sent a messenger but we're still here brother God still searching out still searching out for that Soul be willing to take him at his own word here's job and we all know his story we all know what happened in his life he had everything and from one day to the next he lost it not only did he lose everything but he also lost his loved ones can you imagine the condition of such a man willing to stay still and accept that what he was living in the day came that that he he just cursed the day he was born he didn't curse God he cursed the day that he was born but he never cursed against God but here the scripture reads I can imagine that he would have a conversation with god thinking on all these things so then job begins to say this he says even today is my complaint bitter my stroke is heavier than my groaning oh that I might know where I might find him that I might even come come even to his seat for example if they told you God is in a certain place if you knew where to find him tell me if you wouldn't go to that place what is it that you would do if you had that opportunity so then job says says I would order my cause before him and fill my mouth with arguments I would know the words which he would answer me and understand that he would say unto me says will he plead against me with his great power no no but he would put strength in me that there the righteous might dispute with him so should I be delivered forever from my judge he is our judge brethren but see if at times it's not that attitude that mankind takes unto God we fill our mouths with argument instead of taking God at his own word and fill our mouth with his word there's only one way that we can speak his word and it's that that word be truly in our hearts because the Bible teaches that our mouth speak our lips speak what is in our hearts yes or no brother you can hear a person when you hear that person speak what that person is speaking that's what's in their heart and job was a faithful man God has called us to take him at his word but at times the trials and tribulations those bitter moments we begin to fight or argue we begin to question and what the one that we question is God you don't question God he is sovereign he knows what he does even when he takes our loved ones from us he knows what he is doing he is God you can't teach him anything he is the Fountain of all knowledge how is it that man can go before God and question him and go and argue with but why is it that this I go through this why is it that you allow this to happen why is that with my son why is that with my wife we fill our mouths with arguments and we begin to speak against God Amen but if we take on his word and if we say Lord I don't understand I know that you are in all things Lord everything is falling apart Lord everything is just falling apart everything is failing but I know that you are faithful to your word I want to stay faithful to your word it doesn't matter where you might take me the Valley of the shadow of death I know that with you I am in security because your rod and your staff they comfort me they Comfort Me Lord Brethren just as children of God let us not argue with God accept God's will accept what God wants for our lives because God has a purpose for us and the only way to fulfill our purpose taking God at his word because any person that takes God's word live the reproach of the [Applause] word so let us not fill our mouths with arguments let us not blame God because we are truly the ones that find our own Mist we are the ones that fail God God never fails us man that fails God but if I'm failing if I feel like I feel burdensome for faing there's a hope for us Mercy for [Applause] us even through our right there might fall a thousand 10,000 to our left God is [Applause] Faith and he can maintain us faith if we can grab a hold of that word why reason I've realized that that or I've realized that if we reason if I reason I'm wrong if I complain I'm wrong if I shout and kick I'm wrong it's me that's wrong God is fa he wants to see that I might be still you see that those words up there still and know that I am God how is it that God can work through us if we don't stay still sufficient time if we begin to reason if we begin to question and if we fill our mouths with arguments God places to one side he doesn't even hear us we have to draw an eye unto God in the correct manner 40 verse one moreover the Lord answered job and said shall he that contendeth with the almighty instruct him he that reproveth God let him answer it then job answered the Lord and said behold I am vile what shall I answer Thee I will lay my hand upon my mouth once have I spoken but I will not answer y twice but I will proceed no further who how how shall he instruct the almighty where is our life whom does our life depend upon isn't it in God's hands isn't it in God's will he is here teaching us he that argues with God answer this so it's it's not the wise and prudent too it's better to stay still and not say a word can you say Amen that is the wise to stay quiet even though in family familial situations someone is beating on the other the other one better to stay still let the the Wrath pass and then at the right time to be able to speak what is this then answered the Lord unto job out of the Whirlwind and said G up thy loins now like a man I will demand of thee and declare thou unto me he's asking him will that also disel my my judgment will thou condemn me that thou mayest be righteous hast thou an arm like God or can thou Thunder with a voice like him who can answer that there no man that can answer that God has descended with a mighty arm just as when he sent Moses I've descended unto you Moses to free my people with a mighty hand but I have sent you in the same manner God has sent us even a messenger to free us from death and sin that daily beats us but no we prefer to argue one with another or against God we blame him for our mistakes we blame him for what happens to us to be able to justify ourselves you know that our own righteousness are just as filthy rags can you say [Music] Amen there's not a way that we can justify ourselves there's no way that we can save our own selves he already saved us he already Justified us if we can just take him at his word for me his word is sufficient it's more than able to justify me it's able to forgive me if I recognize my mistake if I recognize my sin if I come before God lord judge me forgive me God is just he takes AJ Jud he doesn't take sides one with the other he stays firm in his judgment how tremendous is God that even our human mind cannot even understand that our human mind can even fathom the the understanding that God has today we live in a day that everybody claims to have God everybody claims to have the message but my question is what does the message produce who has the message what is the message do you believe that this message produces humility help me this morning when I mention the word humility you think on the opposite of humility for example I'm only giving an example humility what is the opposite of humility arrogance we're understanding ourselves right help me in that what is the message well the message has been given to us because the same Lord with Shout with voice of Archangel and with Trumpet Of God he'll descend of heaven but he doesn't touch the Earth we reach him in the air but we're taught he is the one that does these three things through a mighty prophet but what's the message is a is a a desperation shout it's it's an acclamation to wake people up wake up because you're on your way to hell but there's an escape valve that God has provided that you might run through it and your soul can be sure and secure from the from the hands or the claws of sat that is the message and we have the message the message is still spoken God is still patient with us waiting for us to wake up from our our our sleep of death that has invaded us brethren we're not activated to God's things we have them as little things for us it's more important other things than the message of God oh brother why do you say this but just look at your own condition just as you see your condition I can see my condition and I myself have to pinch myself and ask myself what is it that I'm doing with the message that God gave me in my hand oh I already read it oh I already heard it oh there's nothing else it's just everybody's repeating it you know why people are repeating it because we don't wake up I've had the opportunity to go out into the mission field and I've heard this today you don't need anything you have the message here's everything well I I stay thinking well that's good you don't even need to congregate brother you don't need a pastor you have the message brother if you have the message the message tells you that you must congregate the message tells you that you must choose a pastor by Revelation and not only that God placed a foundation this building has a foundation can you see the foundation no no we see the beauty of the building but where's the foundation I can't see it brother Jonathan but I know that there is a foundation and in that Foundation there's a foundation that God plac it's built upon of Apostles and Prophets and I'm not happy that God that sent an an angel of Mercy to the Hispanic people an angel is one that sent don't don't get fanatical about it don't think that I'm talking about great things an angel is one that sent that's why I say that I'm happy an angel of Mercy for the Hispanic people just as God sent an angel of Mercy for the Hispanic people he is obligated to send Apostles to those continents and and edified upon the foundation of Apostles and Prophets not only is it prophets can you understand that brother you have to get on the center of things because I've got got to places like that one time I got to T chapas it's there next to the Border there with Guatemala and there was a man there that was painted there we don't believe in doctrines of Apostles and this and that we got there we already there and the attack began is good brother but his wife was Ill at home had been two or three years that she had been in bed and God moved us on us to be able to make contact with the sister to be able to speak with her sister what happened while that brother was arguing over there others here where we're talking to sister and she was saying that something happened to her foot and the thing I missed the most is to be able to go to the services and we asked her sister do you believe God is faithful to heal you she said I believe he is you believe that if we pray unto God he can heal you literally that which was on her foot was was worms I saw them she says I believe that God can heal me brother I said sister and if God heals you what are you going to do I promise to go to church the rest of the days that I have of my life to honor God and His word sister according to his word and God that knows our hearts we're going to pray a very simple prayer so that God could bring a double healing unto her brother God is my witness at that exact moment that Sister Rose up we took her by the arms began to walk slowly Don't Be Afraid sister don't be afraid my my legs just don't answer don't be afraid everything is done God heard your prayer all of a sudden we let her go and the sister began to worship God what is that that's God's power it's God the Healer vindicating his word and truly today we're still in an Apostolic age the people of God is is an Apostolic people we believe in the Holy Spirit we believe in Divine Healing we believe in that promise of Pentecost for us today is it for you [Music] brother so then it's not only say what with this and that's you must be edified upon the correct manner is that right but what is it that happens then with us what is it that happens at times our announcement isn't placed correctly our announcement as children of God do you remember that bar that the prophet talks about there was that bar Hall let's just call it that bar Hall the corner and and the a young man went in and the the bartender says says sir your your sign is hanging and then theart he looked onto the sign he says no it's placed right no no sir I'm not talking about that sign talking about that sign because there was a drunkard that had fallen there outside think about your sign at times our sign is just the one hanging to the one side the children of God the people of God the Brethren of the last time age but how much do you love God brother do we love God with all our [Music] heart love your brothers also if you love God you love your brethren amen even when his sign is Fallen brother brother God is faithful God can help you help to raise up or lift up that we are children of God the devil doesn't want us to recognize that the devil wants to devalue us God knows that we are valuable we are we're worth so much the Apostle Paul said that we were just Limitless in why do we let them that the devil Dev Val us so much one devalue themselves for a cigarette others for a drug whis others for for a bottle of whiskey others devalue themselves for a night of pleasure others devalue themselves for a position others devalue themselves for a little bit of money but God continues being faithful God is and he can maintain us are willing to subject our subject our there's a line of Mercy that God placed subject ourselves to that line am amen we're very peculiar people Brethren I'm I'm I'm even bold enough to say that we are superace and I can say it with Assurance we are the children of the great Eternal God we are the children of the great king of the Lord of lords amen we are a super race we are a chosen we are true a true was called we must take God and His word is that righten we're saved by his grace and the prophet of God said and Grace from head to toe the children of God to toe when you walk through the streets God's grace walking and God's grace walking the only thing that is Grace Grace Grace we have to take God in all his words what is it that this message produces remember only in your mind the opposite this message produces humility this message produces love this message produces forgiveness this message produces righteousness this message is the truth this message is faithfulness this message is unity this message is peace what does this message produce what do this message produce is a for the Lord Jesus Christ and she does not have her own particular she's willing to reflect what he is she's not reflecting that and she is not the bride because the bride has to reflect exactly the light of the sun has to reflect the same message one day Jesus arrived after having healed that woman with the bloodish after asking who touched me everyone was touching him how is it that you can ask who touched you someone touched because virtue went out of me search out that person and he connects himself with her he sees her with and that person comes unto him the bible say that she arrived there with fear and tremble placing herself at at his feet and he told her she told him all the truth that's the problem with us that we want God but we want our own way behind us we don't come unto him telling him all but you can't hide to God everything that you're doing you can't deceive God thank you amen you begin to walk and there's a man and and he says to her your daughter has died okay and as soon as Jesus heard the word word was spoken he said unto the ruler of the synagogue he was the ruler of the synagogue he wasn't just any old man and Jesus heard what had happened and Jesus said Be not Afraid only believe and he suffered no man to follow him saved Peter and James and John the brother of James and he came to the house of the ruler of the synagogue and seeth the tumult and them that wept and wailed greatly and when he come in he said unto them why make ye this ad the damsel is not dead but sleepeth tell me at times that that's not our own situation oh we feel like we're dying oh nobody understands oh nobody knows what's going not even my husband understands me only believe fear not only believe even if everything looks like it's against you only believe only believe don't question don't question don't fill your mouth with murmur don't even question God only believe the the the girl is not dead but sleepeth and they made and

way the situation is look at my family look at my children look at the church look at the work look at the nation everything is well am it's all for a purpose so that we might mature so that we might grab a hold we might grab a hold of God's word and take him at his word and the people laughed at him to scorn but when he had put them all out get to one side unbeliever unbeliever let God Work look if you're going to be there with your question can you go over there that's God he continues working heavens and earth shall pass away but his word shall never he continues being the same do you believe that the word of God is working amen amen they take them all out take the father and the mother of the damel words he took he took the main the principle maybe he asked them well is everything okay between both of you you haven't failed failed each other you know what I'm talking about right is everything okay because right now we're going to pray for the little girl and if you believe everything's going to be okay but is everything here okay at home and them that were with him and entered in where the damsel was lying and he and he took the damsel by the hand and said unto heral which is being interpreted damel I say unto thee arise and straight away the damsel arose and walked and she was at the age of 12 years and they were astonished with a great astonishment and he charged them straightly that no man should know it and commanded that something be given her to eat we we sing the song and we say that we are just how many are like the apple of his the Lord maybe you might see the situation when I say that you look inside and you feel a bit dead in there but recognize that which God tells you just rise up damsel arise Jesus tells you this morning be my beloved
