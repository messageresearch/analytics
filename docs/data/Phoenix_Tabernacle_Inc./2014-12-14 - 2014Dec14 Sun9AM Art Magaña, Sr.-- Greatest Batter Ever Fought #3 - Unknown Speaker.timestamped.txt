[56:12] [Music]
[56:21] them but when Jesus saw it
[56:25] he was displeased he was much displeased
[56:28] and said unto
[56:31] them suffer the little children to come
[56:34] unto
[56:35] me and forbid them
[56:40] not for of such in the is the kingdom of
[56:44] God another
[56:49] scripture Matthew
[56:53] 1810 and this is a
[56:58] [Music]
[57:02] scripture that comes to me as in a way
[57:05] of
[57:06] sadness listen to
[57:20] this take heed that you despise not one
[57:23] of these little ones
[57:29] [Music]

[57:36] Angels do always behold the face of My
[57:39] Father which is in
[57:41] [Music]
[57:43] heaven when one doesn't understand
[57:50] Brothers they treat their
[57:53] children
[57:56] obligating them to serve the
[57:58] [Music]
[58:00] Lord that's not how it
[58:04] is and I committed many
[58:07] errors not
[58:09] errors or
[58:14] Horrors and that's what sens
[58:19] me but we can't fix what happened in the
[58:22] past but yes
[58:25] the present we can and this
[58:30] scripture is not just for brother
[58:33] Gustavo or sister
[58:36] LTE but for all the
[58:39] grandparents for all the
[58:42] parents and also most
[58:46] importantly for your
[58:50] [Music]
[58:53] matrimony
[58:59] one commits many
[59:02] mistakes for not saying other
[59:05] [Music]
[59:08] words but knowing that we are in mid
[59:11] [Music]

[1:20:18] 58 good morning
[1:20:21] buos I'd like to wish brother Lo a happy
[1:20:27] birthday he's one of the pillars here in
[1:20:30] Phoenix
[1:20:32] Tabernacle phoen I believe that we
[1:20:34] should respect the pillars of the
[1:20:40] church the ones who help helped
[1:20:42] establish Us in the
[1:20:49] Faith 1 Peter 5 8 through1 reads like
[1:20:57] this be sober be villig because your
[1:21:01] adversary the devil as a roaring lion
[1:21:05] walketh about seeking whom he may
[1:21:16] devour whom resist steadfast in the
[1:21:19] faith knowing that the same afflictions
[1:21:22] are accomplished in your brethren that
[1:21:25] are in the
[1:21:33] world but the God of all Grace who hath
[1:21:37] called us unto his eternal glory by
[1:21:41] Christ Jesus after that you have
[1:21:43] suffered a while make you perfect
[1:21:47] establish strengthen and settle

[1:22:12] chapter and we're going to start with
[1:22:14] verse
[1:22:21] 10
[1:22:24] and it reads like
[1:22:25] this finally my brethren be strong in
[1:22:29] the Lord and in the power of His
[1:22:38] might Hallelujah put on the whole armor
[1:22:41] of God that ye may be able to stand
[1:22:44] against the Ws of the
[1:22:51] devil
[1:22:54] for we wrestle not against flesh and
[1:22:56] blood but against principalities against
[1:22:59] Powers against the rulers of Darkness of
[1:23:02] this world against spiritual wickedness
[1:23:06] in high
[1:23:21] places wherefore take unto you the whole
[1:23:24] armor of God that you may be able to
[1:23:27] withstand in the evil day and having
[1:23:30] done all to
[1:23:41] stand stand therefore having your loins
[1:23:44] GT about with truth and having on the
[1:23:47] breastplate of
[1:23:51] righteousness
[1:23:55] and having and your feet Shaw with the
[1:23:58] preparation of the
[1:24:05] Gospel above all taking the shield of
[1:24:09] Faith wherewith you shall be able to
[1:24:11] quench all the fiery darts of the
[1:24:20] wicked and take the helmet of Salvation
[1:24:23] And The Sword of the spirit which is the
[1:24:25] word of
[1:24:31] God and one more place I'd like to turn
[1:24:34] in the scripture to Daniel 12 verse
[1:24:43] one and at that time
[1:24:46] Michael and at that time shall Michael
[1:24:49] stand up the great Prince which standed
[1:24:52] for the children of thy people and there
[1:24:54] shall be a time of trouble such as never
[1:24:58] was since there was a nation even to
[1:25:01] that same time and at that time thy
[1:25:04] people shall be delivered
[1:25:06] everyone that shall be found written in
[1:25:09] the
[1:25:21] book
[1:25:31] you may be seated may the Lord add His
[1:25:33] blessings to the reading of the
[1:25:41] word now we've been speaking
[1:25:44] about how that there was this great
[1:25:47] battle that started in
[1:25:51] heaven
[1:25:54] and the Bible tells us that before the
[1:25:56] foundation of the world that God
[1:25:58] predestinated an army to fight this end
[1:26:02] Time
[1:26:07] battle and that it that how it was God
[1:26:11] that personally
[1:26:14] selected this
[1:26:17] Army and he trained
[1:26:19] them and he qualified them
[1:26:23] and he put a seal upon
[1:26:25] them seal of the Holy
[1:26:28] Ghost and then he placed them
[1:26:32] positionally in the mystical body of
[1:26:34] Jesus
[1:26:36] Christ and then he commissioned
[1:26:40] them to go out into all the
[1:26:43] world and to preach the
[1:26:46] gospel to
[1:26:48] demonstrate the same works that the
[1:26:50] master did
[1:26:53] and that they should confront the
[1:26:56] enemy in a face to face battle and that
[1:27:00] it would be a hand toand
[1:27:07] combat every Army equips their
[1:27:13] soldiers with the best weapons that they
[1:27:16] can
[1:27:19] develop and the sophistication of that
[1:27:22] certain
[1:27:25] Weaponry is what gives one Army the
[1:27:28] superiority over the
[1:27:32] other isn't that right that's why we're
[1:27:35] always trying to develop the best
[1:27:43] weapon that gives us the the
[1:27:47] superiority over all the world the best
[1:27:51] aircraft
[1:27:53] the best
[1:27:55] fighters and that's that's what we look
[1:27:59] for but the prophet told
[1:28:02] us that God in the
[1:28:05] beginning from before there was even an
[1:28:07] earth
[1:28:09] here that he placed into the hands of
[1:28:11] his
[1:28:13] children the best weapon that there
[1:28:16] could ever
[1:28:19] be and he said he placed his word
[1:28:24] he put his word before
[1:28:27] them and brother brandham told
[1:28:29] us that the word plows a
[1:28:34] ditch and that all we need to do is
[1:28:36] follow behind
[1:28:39] it but it was the best weapon that the
[1:28:43] Father the great
[1:28:46] Creator the one who has all the
[1:28:49] wisdom he chose the best
[1:28:53] weapon and he chose his
[1:28:57] word and he equipped his children with
[1:29:01] that and all the way from the Garden of
[1:29:05] Eden until the
[1:29:07] Rapture it's the same
[1:29:10] weapon and today I want to focus in on
[1:29:13] that
[1:29:16] weapon I believe it's a secret
[1:29:20] weapon it's the belie secret
[1:29:25] weapon and the in the last two times
[1:29:27] that I
[1:29:28] spoke we talked about the
[1:29:31] Battle and how it is that it it it it
[1:29:34] began to be set in
[1:29:38] Array and how that the prophet talk to
[1:29:40] us about the inner solar
[1:29:45] system those three
[1:29:48] circles and how that we needed to have a
[1:29:50] new order
[1:29:53] that we had to be
[1:29:56] redesigned because the plan of God was
[1:30:00] interrupted and the evil one came and he
[1:30:04] interrupted the
[1:30:06] plan but it was all in the father's
[1:30:10] mind that that would take
[1:30:12] place and that he could demonstrate his
[1:30:17] fullness that he could show us that he
[1:30:19] was a savior
[1:30:23] that he was a
[1:30:25] Healer and he wanted to be able to
[1:30:27] demonstrate what those qual
[1:30:32] qualities that were inside of
[1:30:36] him the devil's not pulling anything
[1:30:38] over
[1:30:41] God God in the
[1:30:43] beginning knew exactly what was
[1:30:49] going that's right
[1:30:56] I'd like to read this quote taking
[1:31:01] from taken from the message take on the
[1:31:04] whole armor of
[1:31:07] God when brother Brandon preached the
[1:31:09] message the greatest battle ever
[1:31:13] fought and then he spoke wisdom versus
[1:31:17] faith and then he preached the message
[1:31:20] called the conflict between God and
[1:31:25] Satan so really you could say that the
[1:31:28] the uh these messages were sequels to
[1:31:31] the greatest battle ever
[1:31:36] [Music]
[1:31:38] fought and then when he went out into
[1:31:40] the missionary
[1:31:42] field he preached the series of taking
[1:31:45] on the whole armor of
[1:31:48] God using the same thought that he
[1:31:53] when he preached the greatest battle
[1:31:55] ever
[1:31:57] fought so it reads like
[1:32:00] this so the infinite God going to choose
[1:32:04] for his
[1:32:07] army the infinite God is going to choose
[1:32:09] for his army the best weapon that could
[1:32:12] be
[1:32:17] given and he chose it and it was his
[1:32:20] word
[1:32:22] God gave his army the best equipment
[1:32:25] that could ever that they could ever
[1:32:30] use and would never have to be
[1:32:34] changed you don't improve
[1:32:36] it it Remains the Same all the
[1:32:40] time it's God's
[1:32:43] word and that's what he fortified his
[1:32:46] people
[1:32:48] with that's tremendous isn't it
[1:32:52] fortified by the
[1:32:54] word God has equipped his army with his
[1:33:09] word trying to get the next slide oh
[1:33:12] there it is sorry
[1:33:16] paron but he equipped his
[1:33:20] army
[1:33:25] I want to speak this morning on the
[1:33:27] greatest battle ever
[1:33:31] fought and I want to put a subtitle on
[1:33:35] it the believer's hidden Mystery
[1:33:41] weapon I want to really focus in this
[1:33:44] morning on that
[1:33:47] weapon that armor that he fortified us
[1:33:50] with
[1:33:53] sometimes I think when we use when we
[1:33:55] say the the phrase the
[1:34:00] word our our attention is just limited
[1:34:02] to this
[1:34:07] book and I want to kind of expand that
[1:34:09] for us this
[1:34:13] morning the hidden Mystery weapon that
[1:34:17] has been
[1:34:20] hid
[1:34:22] from the ages and
[1:34:25] generations and is now manifested to his
[1:34:30] Saints in deuteron Deuteronomy
[1:34:35] 2929 it reads like this the secret
[1:34:39] things belong unto the Lord Our
[1:34:45] God but those things which are
[1:34:49] revealed belong unto us
[1:34:52] and unto our
[1:34:54] children the things that are revealed
[1:34:57] belong unto
[1:35:00] us and to our
[1:35:02] children and notice why he says it is
[1:35:06] revealed to
[1:35:08] us they're
[1:35:10] revealed so that we may do all the words
[1:35:13] that are in the
[1:35:16] law so that unfolds that why we become
[1:35:19] the
[1:35:20] recipients
[1:35:23] of that we are the
[1:35:25] recipients of the revealed
[1:35:29] word so that we can make it
[1:35:33] manifest so that it'll be understood
[1:35:36] what we are to
[1:35:39] do so that's why the Mysteries were made
[1:35:42] known in this
[1:35:45] age so that the
[1:35:47] bride could fulfill all those things
[1:35:49] that were spoken
[1:35:53] but it had to be made plain to
[1:35:55] her it had to be
[1:35:58] revealed we talked about who is the one
[1:36:01] who gives the
[1:36:03] Revelation it's the father it's the one
[1:36:06] who he has
[1:36:09] predetermined to deposit that
[1:36:13] seed the one that he
[1:36:15] chose before the foundation of the
[1:36:19] world to reveal his word to
[1:36:22] that's why he told
[1:36:24] Peter blessed art thou Simon
[1:36:28] barjon flesh and blood has not revealed
[1:36:30] this to
[1:36:31] you but my Father which is in heaven has
[1:36:36] revealed this to you and Upon This
[1:36:39] Rock I'll build my church and the Gates
[1:36:43] of Hell shall not Prevail
[1:36:45] against the great hidden mystery
[1:36:50] word
[1:36:52] the hidden
[1:36:53] Mystery that has been hidden from all
[1:36:57] time but now said the Apostle
[1:36:59] Paul has been made
[1:37:02] manifest
[1:37:04] Saints what a great thing that is my
[1:37:08] goodness the
[1:37:11] importance of
[1:37:13] Revelation the prophet preached it to
[1:37:16] us over and over and
[1:37:20] over
[1:37:27] what is the secret
[1:37:29] weapon when the prophet says the
[1:37:33] word that it is the word that is the
[1:37:37] weapon I I want to open that up this
[1:37:41] morning I want I want you to realize
[1:37:44] what is the fullness of what he is
[1:37:46] speaking to
[1:37:50] us
[1:37:52] I want you to turn into your Bibles to
[1:37:54] First John
[1:37:58] 5:7 a beautiful
[1:38:01] scripture and it's one that the prophet
[1:38:04] validated for us in this
[1:38:07] age you know the theologians have a hard
[1:38:10] time with this
[1:38:13] scripture but the Believers of this
[1:38:16] message don't have a problem with it
[1:38:19] because the prophet
[1:38:21] utilized it and he explained it and he
[1:38:25] Vindicated it and it reads like this for
[1:38:29] there are three that bear record in
[1:38:32] heaven the Father the word and the Holy
[1:38:36] Ghost and these three are
[1:38:43] one
[1:38:46] now and there the the Apostle John is
[1:38:49] making that relationship for
[1:38:53] us that the Father the word and the holy
[1:38:58] ghost that they are
[1:39:09] one and there I put it there so you
[1:39:11] could see it all
[1:39:14] together the Father the Holy Ghost the
[1:39:19] creative power the
[1:39:22] Revelation it's the believer's hidden
[1:39:24] secret
[1:39:36] weapon now let's look at these two
[1:39:38] scriptures
[1:39:39] here that speak about the creative
[1:39:43] power which which which is the word
[1:39:46] which dwells in the
[1:39:50] word
[1:39:51] Hebrews 11:3 reads like
[1:39:54] this through faith we understand that
[1:39:57] the world were framed by the word of God
[1:40:00] so that things which are seen were not
[1:40:03] made of things which do
[1:40:16] appear and in Colossians it reads like
[1:40:19] this for by him the word were all things
[1:40:25] created that are in heaven and that are
[1:40:28] in Earth visible and invisible whether
[1:40:32] they be Thrones or dominions or
[1:40:35] principalities or powers or things were
[1:40:38] created by Him and for
[1:40:49] him
[1:40:56] remember we're targeting on the
[1:40:59] believer's hidden secret
[1:41:05] weapon the one that the heavenly father
[1:41:08] gave
[1:41:10] us the one that he gave us to battle
[1:41:13] against the wicked
[1:41:17] one now let's go back in in in the
[1:41:23] and
[1:41:25] foreshadow or see the
[1:41:27] foreshadow of this secret
[1:41:30] weapon now brother brandom takes us back
[1:41:33] before the foundation of the
[1:41:37] world and he said that the father had
[1:41:39] the
[1:41:43] capability to see the end from the
[1:41:46] beginning and it was with that
[1:41:49] capability
[1:41:51] that he wrote the
[1:41:53] Bible and then brother Bram tells
[1:41:56] us that then he was able to send it
[1:41:58] forth to the
[1:42:01] prophet and then they were they would
[1:42:03] speak it
[1:42:05] forth so that we could
[1:42:07] see what God's great plan
[1:42:11] was and God foreseen this this great
[1:42:15] battle this great end time
[1:42:19] Showdown where that battle was going
[1:42:22] that battle from
[1:42:24] Angels was going to come down and become
[1:42:27] a human
[1:42:30] battle the Bible tells us in the Book of
[1:42:35] Romans that all
[1:42:38] nature that all the
[1:42:41] creation is
[1:42:43] groaning and travaileth in
[1:42:47] pain that it travaileth in pain
[1:42:51] waiting for the main
[1:42:55] event for the main event to take
[1:42:58] place the manifestation of the sons of
[1:43:02] God brother the Bible says the
[1:43:06] creation but brother brandham says it's
[1:43:08] all
[1:43:10] nature that it's moaning and groaning
[1:43:13] and
[1:43:14] pain waiting for this special
[1:43:18] time this time in history
[1:43:22] that this event of the manifestation of
[1:43:24] the sons of
[1:43:27] God a special event that has never toen
[1:43:31] place at no time in the history of the
[1:43:35] Earth this ever tooken
[1:43:38] place but it's getting ready to unfold
[1:43:42] itself in this time that we
[1:43:46] live and we know that the closing
[1:43:49] minutes
[1:43:51] of all time are
[1:43:54] ending so
[1:43:56] somewhere some time this great
[1:44:00] event is upon us at this very
[1:44:15] minute God before the foundation of the
[1:44:19] world he had something in the back part
[1:44:22] of his
[1:44:25] mind that he wanted to
[1:44:28] achieve he wanted to express
[1:44:32] himself and he showed his his
[1:44:35] plan and brother brandham tells us that
[1:44:39] he began unfolding it little by
[1:44:43] little he began to show it in for in in
[1:44:46] Shadows and
[1:44:49] types he expressed his life through the
[1:44:52] Patriarchs and the
[1:44:55] prophets now the message tells us quite
[1:44:58] a bit about the
[1:45:01] prophets and brother brandham tells us
[1:45:03] that the word of the Lord came directly
[1:45:05] to the
[1:45:09] prophet and I want to focus in on them
[1:45:12] this
[1:45:14] morning because I believe they were a
[1:45:17] very
[1:45:18] type of that manif estation that's
[1:45:22] coming where the word of the Lord would
[1:45:24] come to the
[1:45:27] prophets when the word of the Lord was
[1:45:29] revealed to the
[1:45:32] prophet it made them
[1:45:35] different they became different men
[1:45:37] after
[1:45:39] that the Bible tells us that they
[1:45:42] stopped the mouth of
[1:45:47] lions they interrupted
[1:45:49] nature
[1:45:51] they performed
[1:45:52] Miracles they raised the
[1:45:55] dead they healed the
[1:45:57] sick they opposed
[1:46:00] Kings and they proclaimed the word of
[1:46:03] the
[1:46:04] Lord
[1:46:08] were and all this the father
[1:46:13] foreshadowing unfolding little by
[1:46:17] little his great plan that he had
[1:46:25] now I want you to notice how the word
[1:46:27] reveals
[1:46:31] itself I'm going to read these
[1:46:34] scriptures and I just want you to follow
[1:46:37] me watch how watch the
[1:46:40] difference That Came Upon This
[1:46:43] Man when the word of the Lord was
[1:46:45] revealed to
[1:46:47] him and remember we're we're
[1:46:51] focusing we want to bring our
[1:46:55] attention to that secret
[1:46:58] weapon that weapon that the father put
[1:47:01] in our
[1:47:03] hands that Paul tells us that it was
[1:47:08] hidden from before the foundation of the
[1:47:11] world but is now being
[1:47:16] revealed and it reads like
[1:47:19] this and 1 Samuel 3:7 don't turn there
[1:47:22] just
[1:47:23] listen now Samuel did not know the Lord
[1:47:27] neither was the word of the Lord yet
[1:47:29] revealed to
[1:47:34] him and Samuel grew and the Lord was
[1:47:38] with him and he did not let none of his
[1:47:41] words fall to the
[1:47:49] ground and I I want to stop here and I
[1:47:51] want to make emphasis on
[1:47:54] that notice that this young child
[1:47:59] Prophet that he didn't let none of the
[1:48:01] words of the Lord fall to the
[1:48:06] ground I believe that's what the Bride
[1:48:08] of this age
[1:48:11] does she doesn't allow any of the words
[1:48:15] of the
[1:48:17] Prophet anything that the prophet reveal
[1:48:20] in this
[1:48:22] day she doesn't let any of it fall to
[1:48:25] the
[1:48:27] ground but she lets it fall right in
[1:48:31] here because she knows that one
[1:48:34] day that the father that that Holy
[1:48:38] Spirit will move upon that
[1:48:42] heart quicking that word
[1:48:46] seed Quicken that word seed to
[1:48:49] her
[1:48:55] 1 Samuel 3:21 reads like
[1:48:58] this and the Lord appeared again in
[1:49:01] Shiloh for the Lord revealed himself to
[1:49:05] Samuel in sh by the word of the
[1:49:14] Lord it was the word of the Lord that
[1:49:17] gave him the
[1:49:19] revelation
[1:49:21] it was something that ignited
[1:49:24] him brother brandham tells us that Jesus
[1:49:28] said that he knew us before the
[1:49:31] foundation of the
[1:49:33] world there was a conference brother
[1:49:37] Alex in heaven and we spoke to
[1:49:41] him and brother BR tells us that that
[1:49:44] time in our
[1:49:46] minds has been blacked out
[1:49:51] that we can't remember
[1:49:53] it but brother bham tells
[1:49:55] us that at that
[1:49:58] time that we Dro
[1:50:01] down he said that we were
[1:50:04] sent and that we Dro down to come here
[1:50:09] to
[1:50:10] proclaim the Gospel of Jesus
[1:50:14] Christ I believe this morning I believe
[1:50:18] this morning that that's what we're
[1:50:21] doing we're proclaiming the
[1:50:24] gospel to this
[1:50:26] generation that we live in that the word
[1:50:30] of the Lord Has
[1:50:31] Come and it is spoken to us and it has
[1:50:36] been
[1:50:37] quickened not only has it been
[1:50:40] spoken but it's been
[1:50:42] quickened and that word is a
[1:50:46] light and it is displayed to this
[1:50:49] generation
[1:50:52] the prophet
[1:50:57] spoke that's the secret
[1:51:00] weapon it's not just the the confines of
[1:51:05] this this is the word of the
[1:51:08] Lord but it has to be
[1:51:11] quickened the Holy Spirit has
[1:51:14] come and the prophet declared unto
[1:51:18] us that the holy
[1:51:20] ghost is here ready to Quicken
[1:51:30] that the hidden secret
[1:51:39] weapon it's not just what you think
[1:51:43] brother it's more than what you
[1:51:48] think
[1:51:55] when does God give you this
[1:52:01] weapon after you become a
[1:52:05] Christian then you are fortified by the
[1:52:10] word and any promise in the
[1:52:15] word brother BR
[1:52:18] goes I didn't know I was going to say
[1:52:22] that my goodness when you become a
[1:52:26] Christian you're placed behind the word
[1:52:28] of
[1:52:31] God there's your
[1:52:34] Fortress
[1:52:35] safety what a great thing that is
[1:52:39] man to be
[1:52:41] fortified behind the
[1:52:44] word that's why the prophet repeats to
[1:52:47] us over and over again
[1:52:51] and that's why the great anointed David
[1:52:54] would
[1:52:56] say the Lord is my
[1:52:58] shield and my strength of whom shall I
[1:53:02] be
[1:53:06] afraid
[1:53:09] now when we are placed behind the
[1:53:14] word the Bible tells us about four
[1:53:18] living creatures
[1:53:22] the temple guards or the throne
[1:53:27] guards
[1:53:36] Z when we are
[1:53:39] behind when we are in the
[1:53:45] word then these guards go before
[1:53:48] us
[1:53:57] being a student of this
[1:54:03] church under the teaching of our
[1:54:07] pastor brother
[1:54:10] Bernie now how many here can say that we
[1:54:14] know what the temple guards
[1:54:18] are yes sir yes sir and then brother
[1:54:22] Bernie would stand up here sometimes and
[1:54:24] he would tell
[1:54:25] us who's in the
[1:54:28] north the
[1:54:29] eagle the Prophet The Prophet
[1:54:33] evangelist who's in the East the lion
[1:54:37] the Apostle and who's in the
[1:54:40] west the ox
[1:54:43] power the thank you the pastor the
[1:54:48] burden Bearer
[1:54:52] and who's in the South the man the
[1:54:55] teacher the one that cometh with
[1:54:58] wisdom and speaketh to us these four
[1:55:02] living
[1:55:03] creatures the prophet told us whenever
[1:55:06] you see
[1:55:08] one then you know that behind one of
[1:55:11] them is the
[1:55:15] throne it's our
[1:55:17] job to be able to identify
[1:55:21] CU behind them is the throne and what's
[1:55:26] what's in the
[1:55:27] throne the very voice of God the very
[1:55:31] creative
[1:55:32] power the one that said if you abide in
[1:55:36] me and my words abide in
[1:55:39] you then
[1:55:41] ask ask and you shall you shall
[1:55:46] receive what you've asked for the
[1:55:49] creative
[1:55:51] power in the
[1:55:53] church right
[1:55:56] [Applause]
[1:56:01] now the first Throne was in
[1:56:05] heaven the second Throne was in
[1:56:09] Christ and the third th Throne is in
[1:56:13] man the Bible tells
[1:56:16] us that the word of God is quick
[1:56:20] and powerful and sharper than any
[1:56:23] two-edged
[1:56:26] sword piercing even
[1:56:29] unto the dividing the Thunder of the
[1:56:31] Soul and
[1:56:33] Spirit and of the joints in the
[1:56:38] marrow and is a
[1:56:41] discerner a
[1:56:43] discerner of the thoughts and
[1:56:48] intents my goodness the secret
[1:56:56] weapon
[1:56:57] placed inside the
[1:57:01] believer so that we could go
[1:57:04] out into the front
[1:57:07] line and face the wicked
[1:57:12] one in the greatest battle that was ever
[1:57:18] fought but there was
[1:57:21] requirement it was that the father was
[1:57:24] going to train these
[1:57:27] men and there would be a special group
[1:57:29] of
[1:57:45] people now this is just what I read here
[1:57:48] oh was this this
[1:57:51] that the first this is in the message
[1:57:53] Revelation chapter 4 part
[1:57:58] two preached in
[1:58:02] 1961 one of brother Bernie's favorite
[1:58:07] themes talking about the three
[1:58:11] Thrones and the Tabernacle and the
[1:58:17] Wilderness now the first Throne was in
[1:58:19] heaven the Judgment
[1:58:23] seat the second Throne was in
[1:58:27] Christ the third Throne is in
[1:58:30] man now what is a
[1:58:34] man and the brother brandham reads
[1:58:38] on and he makes a statement at the end
[1:58:41] that I want to
[1:58:42] say God in his heart makes him believe
[1:58:48] things that he can't
[1:58:51] see it's it's in that
[1:58:55] subconscious where the Holy Ghost
[1:58:58] moves that's where faith
[1:59:01] lies and when the Holy Ghost comes upon
[1:59:04] that
[1:59:06] subconscious and that's where he can
[1:59:09] speak and then he can say something like
[1:59:13] this say to that
[1:59:16] fish you can have your life back
[1:59:20] isn't that
[1:59:27] right the secret
[1:59:31] weapon that he gave to his
[1:59:34] Believers to fight in this greatest
[1:59:41] battle are those slides coming out right
[1:59:44] on the screen yeah they look short here
[1:59:50] so everything that God has spoken his
[1:59:52] word received into the right
[1:59:58] channel in the right
[2:00:00] channel will
[2:00:07] materialize for whatever promise is
[2:00:09] behind
[2:00:13] it then if you if you abide in
[2:00:18] me
[2:00:19] and my word abide in
[2:00:22] you then you have
[2:00:25] God my
[2:00:28] goodness the word the secret weapon in
[2:00:34] you now does everybody have that secret
[2:00:39] weapon my goodness
[2:00:44] wow you know you know brother brandham
[2:00:47] said speaking about the
[2:00:50] adoption he said there's only going to
[2:00:52] be a few
[2:00:56] of
[2:01:02] my then you have God's word in
[2:01:05] you you have God's life in
[2:01:09] you and you have God in
[2:01:13] you and whatever God's word speaks forth
[2:01:17] of
[2:01:18] you
[2:01:21] it don't have to come to
[2:01:23] pass just like it was spoke from
[2:01:28] God now here there's the condition
[2:01:31] there whatever God's word
[2:01:36] speaks when he
[2:01:38] says speak
[2:01:40] it that's where a lot of people make the
[2:01:47] mistake because they don't understand
[2:01:49] that we're
[2:01:53] subjective to
[2:01:57] him but the bride realizes
[2:02:00] that she knows that she can't
[2:02:04] move without him unless he
[2:02:08] says that's why the prophet said she has
[2:02:10] thus sayith the
[2:02:13] Lord and she knows what to do with
[2:02:17] it she knows that it's not not
[2:02:19] her it's him it's the word it's that
[2:02:24] quickening
[2:02:25] power it's that creative
[2:02:28] power moving in that word
[2:02:32] seed now would you like to see his
[2:02:35] commanding
[2:02:38] officers how many knew that he had
[2:02:40] commanding
[2:02:45] officers commanding officers in this
[2:02:47] Army
[2:02:50] let's see what brother Bram
[2:02:57] says I think that's that's uh the one I
[2:03:00] just
[2:03:03] read
[2:03:05] okay so this was taken from the message
[2:03:09] taking on the whole armor of
[2:03:13] God Santa Maria California Sant Maria
[2:03:16] California in
[2:03:17] 1962
[2:03:19] now remember what I told you how he
[2:03:22] preached the greatest battle ever
[2:03:25] fought wisdom versus
[2:03:28] Faith the conflict between God and
[2:03:31] Satan and then he preached these
[2:03:33] messages of putting on the hor Armor of
[2:03:38] God see we have to follow the
[2:03:41] prophet because sometimes he didn't say
[2:03:45] everything he wanted to
[2:03:47] say
[2:03:49] in one message and just like any other
[2:03:53] preacher that text follows him wherever
[2:03:55] he
[2:03:57] goes until he gets it all out of
[2:04:03] him in his
[2:04:05] army he presents his army in the form of
[2:04:09] five
[2:04:11] offices brother brandom in another quote
[2:04:14] which I didn't want to read at this
[2:04:17] time because it would take too much time
[2:04:20] he says that's his dress
[2:04:23] wear that those five
[2:04:26] offices are his dress
[2:04:28] wear in other words that's what he puts
[2:04:32] on when he wants to when he wants to
[2:04:40] speak so he presents his
[2:04:45] army in the form of the five offices
[2:04:50] now brother brandom teaches us a lot
[2:04:52] about an
[2:04:55] office the offices are different than
[2:04:58] the gifts that are in the
[2:05:01] body the offices have been
[2:05:05] predestinated from begin before the
[2:05:07] foundation of the
[2:05:09] world and that nobody puts those offices
[2:05:13] in in
[2:05:16] action only the father
[2:05:19] it's the father who puts them in
[2:05:23] action no man can put another man in
[2:05:27] this
[2:05:34] office he presents his army in the form
[2:05:37] of five
[2:05:40] offices first apostles prophets and
[2:05:44] teachers pastors and
[2:05:47] evangelists that's his army
[2:05:49] that's his
[2:05:50] soldiers that's his commanding
[2:05:54] officers what a great thing that is I
[2:05:58] think my goodness today when we don't
[2:06:00] believe in those type of
[2:06:02] things you know the people in the
[2:06:04] message don't believe in in in in in
[2:06:09] rank you know there's there's the
[2:06:11] doctrine that goes
[2:06:13] around and saying that we're all the
[2:06:17] same my goodness
[2:06:20] that's interesting isn't
[2:06:22] it you know there there's a
[2:06:25] thought that comes when you speak about
[2:06:28] the
[2:06:30] godhead that that thought came
[2:06:33] back all the way 2,000 years
[2:06:37] ago and it's this when we talk about the
[2:06:41] revelation of Jesus
[2:06:43] Christ and how that that that that it
[2:06:47] that he is one
[2:06:49] like that scripture that we read in
[2:06:50] first
[2:06:51] John and when you run into somebody who
[2:06:54] has that Doctrine in
[2:06:57] them they'll say this they say oh
[2:07:01] brother nobody can understand the
[2:07:04] godhead not even the theologians can
[2:07:08] understand that's one of those thoughts
[2:07:10] that came from the pit the pits of
[2:07:13] hell that's not true at
[2:07:16] all but that that thought has traveled
[2:07:19] from all over through the
[2:07:22] generations it's went from one to the
[2:07:25] other and every time you hear
[2:07:28] that remember that you're hearing the
[2:07:31] very thoughts of the pits of
[2:07:36] hell because the prophet of God in this
[2:07:40] age he said it very
[2:07:43] simply he said brother all you have to
[2:07:47] do get on your
[2:07:49] knees and ask the father to reveal
[2:07:53] it and it's the same thing with that
[2:07:56] doctrine that I
[2:07:58] said there is a rank in the
[2:08:02] ministry there's an
[2:08:05] order sure all the children are the
[2:08:08] same but there's an order with which the
[2:08:10] word comes
[2:08:13] forth and he said there's no higher
[2:08:16] order than
[2:08:17] that there's no higher order than
[2:08:20] bringing the
[2:08:22] word that's the highest order there
[2:08:26] is and the highest form in the fivefold
[2:08:30] ministry is the Apostle and then the
[2:08:34] prophet and then the teachers and then
[2:08:37] the Evangelist and the
[2:08:47] pastor
[2:08:51] that's his
[2:08:52] army that's his
[2:08:55] soldiers that's his commanding
[2:08:58] officers all with the baptism of the
[2:09:00] Holy
[2:09:01] Ghost waiting waiting out there waiting
[2:09:06] to meet the
[2:09:09] enemy with the word of
[2:09:11] God and each one backing one another
[2:09:16] up see that's the
[2:09:20] that
[2:09:21] Ministry each one backing each other
[2:09:25] up not trying to shoot down
[2:09:28] one that's how you
[2:09:31] know when you see one trying to shoot
[2:09:33] down
[2:09:35] another that's how you know that's not
[2:09:37] God's
[2:09:39] Army the prophet of God
[2:09:42] said that they all stand behind the
[2:09:46] word the father
[2:09:49] that the father goes out in the
[2:09:53] Forefront the chief
[2:09:55] Captain not out there in the front up
[2:09:58] here
[2:10:00] above behind them but in
[2:10:05] them inside of
[2:10:07] them that secret
[2:10:10] weapon thundering out his
[2:10:14] word that creative
[2:10:16] power that faith
[2:10:19] that Holy Ghost quickening the
[2:10:22] word that the father sent
[2:10:25] forth and the Holy Spirit coming behind
[2:10:29] it quickening
[2:10:31] it don't you
[2:10:34] realize that's how the church was
[2:10:37] established the Apostle Peter stood out
[2:10:40] on the day of
[2:10:43] Pentecost he said men
[2:10:47] anden the same
[2:10:49] Jesus that you have
[2:10:54] crucified is the same one who sent this
[2:10:57] go this Holy
[2:11:00] Ghost and the Bible tells
[2:11:03] us using this
[2:11:06] principle that has been restored back to
[2:11:08] us in this
[2:11:11] day while Peter yet spake these
[2:11:15] words while Peter yet spake these words
[2:11:20] the Holy Ghost came
[2:11:21] in and he quickened the
[2:11:24] words that principle is in effect right
[2:11:30] now same
[2:11:32] yesterday today and
[2:11:35] forever if it's not that
[2:11:38] way what are we doing
[2:11:46] there that's his army
[2:11:50] vindicating vindicating
[2:11:52] what his
[2:11:55] resurrection the
[2:11:57] proofs my goodness wow
[2:12:13] am I'm going to stop right
[2:12:15] now but I just I wanted
[2:12:19] to I wanted to focus in this
[2:12:27] morning on that secret
[2:12:33] word that
[2:12:35] weapon that God has placed
[2:12:40] inside of the
[2:12:42] believer the message tells us
[2:12:47] plainly that it was the
[2:12:49] word that
[2:12:51] Elijah was going to
[2:12:54] restore it was the coming of that
[2:12:57] word back to the
[2:13:00] believer not just a
[2:13:03] Doctrine not just a hard copy of a
[2:13:05] printed
[2:13:08] sermon but it was going to be the
[2:13:11] word The Living Word the quickening
[2:13:16] power is that right
[2:13:18] stand to your feet
[2:13:27] please if you would like to Bow your
[2:13:31] heads I would like to ask you a question
[2:13:34] where while we're in this
[2:13:39] presence while we're in this
[2:13:46] atmosphere
[2:13:50] how
[2:13:51] many would like to have that secret
[2:13:56] weapon you know inside the depths of
[2:13:59] your
[2:14:02] heart that that you do not have that you
[2:14:05] are not at that level at this current
[2:14:13] time there's not a lot of time
[2:14:16] left
[2:14:19] things are going to happen
[2:14:24] quickly brother brandham said the Lord
[2:14:27] could could could make that happen at
[2:14:29] any
[2:14:32] minute don't look for big things to
[2:14:36] happen with your eyes closed
[2:14:41] please this is a
[2:14:43] solemn
[2:14:46] time
[2:14:50] brother brandham tells
[2:14:51] us when the
[2:14:53] word comes back to
[2:14:56] you and you receive that
[2:15:00] spirit that you should have received in
[2:15:03] the first
[2:15:05] place that's what we're talking about
[2:15:08] brother when we were back with
[2:15:14] him somewhere
[2:15:16] else and we were
[2:15:19] cognizant that we were going to come
[2:15:21] down
[2:15:23] here in this
[2:15:26] battlefield to fight these Supernatural
[2:15:31] Devils but the father reassured
[2:15:35] us that there would be a
[2:15:38] time when the word would come back to
[2:15:43] us and that we would recognize
[2:15:46] it that we would take it into the depths
[2:15:49] of our
[2:15:52] heart we have to strive to reach
[2:15:57] that that's what the message of the hour
[2:16:02] is the restoration of the
[2:16:05] faith that was once delivered to the
[2:16:10] Saints do you understand what that is
[2:16:16] now
[2:16:21] I had a very hard time bringing this
[2:16:24] this
[2:16:29] week the enemy really tormented
[2:16:36] me because he knew I was going to speak
[2:16:39] about
[2:16:41] this and it was I believe it was the
[2:16:44] desire of the
[2:16:46] Lord Amen to come and to speak about the
[2:16:51] hidden secret message the
[2:16:56] weapon that many people have not been
[2:16:59] able to to
[2:17:02] grasp what the message is telling
[2:17:06] us what has been put into our
[2:17:11] hands it's the word of the
[2:17:14] Lord the father himself
[2:17:19] coming into
[2:17:22] us and fighting this
[2:17:26] battle but we won't let
[2:17:28] him we won't let the word come to
[2:17:33] us because we're too
[2:17:36] busy we let so many things take it out
[2:17:39] of
[2:17:44] us the father has emptied out his
[2:17:50] thoughts the Mysteries brother brandom
[2:17:53] tells
[2:17:54] us the Mysteries that were
[2:17:58] hidden they were hidden from all
[2:18:02] time has been revealed to
[2:18:06] us have been spoken to
[2:18:10] us by a humble
[2:18:13] man in plain
[2:18:16] English in simple
[2:18:19] words he told us what was
[2:18:23] hidden the the the thing that the the
[2:18:26] father wanted to
[2:18:30] achieve he wanted to have a
[2:18:35] family a special designation of
[2:18:41] himself a new
[2:18:44] creation the Bible tells us that he
[2:18:47] stood stood up in this last
[2:18:51] day that he stood on the
[2:18:55] earth and he he proclaimed
[2:18:59] himself the
[2:19:02] beginner or the the the the
[2:19:05] beginning of the creation of
[2:19:08] God and the Bible tells
[2:19:11] us that he spoke a
[2:19:13] word and that he created his own bride
[2:19:18] he spoke the
[2:19:20] word for her to come into
[2:19:23] existence in this
[2:19:25] age and the Holy Ghost has
[2:19:28] come and he's quickened that
[2:19:33] word
[2:19:37] hallelujah if you've
[2:19:40] never had that that
[2:19:46] experience
[2:19:49] brother brandham tells us that is the
[2:19:52] mystery of the Holy
[2:19:55] Ghost coming without
[2:19:59] sensation I'm not talking about your
[2:20:03] birth I'm not talking about a great
[2:20:05] experience of
[2:20:08] sanctification I'm talking when when the
[2:20:10] prophet
[2:20:12] said when the word would come
[2:20:15] again when that word would come to
[2:20:18] you to the person and would make himself
[2:20:27] personalized hallelujah amen if you've
[2:20:30] never realized that
[2:20:36] [Music]
[2:20:40] before thank you
[2:20:43] Lord make that your
[2:20:46] goal make that your
[2:20:49] desire that you won't rest day or
[2:20:53] night until that becomes a
[2:20:59] [Music]
[2:21:04] reality let us pray Heavenly
[2:21:08] Father we thank you
[2:21:11] Lord what a great message you have left
[2:21:13] in our
[2:21:16] hands
[2:21:19] [Music]
[2:21:22] in Heavenly places the believer
[2:21:27] is where the Prophet told
[2:21:30] us that the
[2:21:32] master Whispers secrets to
[2:21:39] her what a place
[2:21:41] Lord I wish my wish is that everyone
[2:21:45] here
[2:21:46] today
[2:21:50] would be able to truly understand that
[2:21:56] Lord they would understand the realities
[2:21:59] of the
[2:22:02] message what the prophet messenger has
[2:22:05] delivered into our
[2:22:09] hands we weren't the prophet of whom the
[2:22:12] word of the Lord came
[2:22:13] [Music]
[2:22:16] to
[2:22:18] but we were those with the predestinated
[2:22:21] good
[2:22:25] ground where that word seed was going to
[2:22:32] drop amen and the Holy Ghost would
[2:22:35] come and he would Quicken that
[2:22:43] word we thank you
[2:22:45] Lord we thank you for your
[2:22:48] word for the the ministry
[2:22:51] Lord thank you for them Lord without
[2:22:55] them we would not be
[2:22:57] here without someone to lay the
[2:23:02] foundation to build up the
[2:23:06] structures the
[2:23:07] pillars we would not be here
[2:23:11] Lord we pray that
[2:23:14] likewise for the generation that is to
[2:23:19] come that we would be like
[2:23:24] that we thank you once again
[2:23:27] Lord I pray that you would hear the Cry

[2:24:39] of is in that
[2:24:42] word you know you know the prophet
[2:24:45] said
