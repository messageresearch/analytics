seen you in a long time or heard from you and we didn't know if I mean we know you're God but we didn't know nothing happened to you we were worried just ever since the crucifixion we've been a little on edge you know it's been hard being in an angel these last few months where're sorry oh I I see but don't you remember I told you that I was going to spend this time of the year with my children I told you you never said anything I natural you are useless see I I needed to spend this time of the year with my children to show them what this time is all about and it's not about all those festive decorations and the fancy dinners or even those lavish presents it's not even about Santa Claus or the Frosted snowman or that little dog with the red nose comment I think he's talking about my dog Peluche no he's Rudolph oh rud off yes that's right that's right but it's not about that do you remember what I told John to write a new commandment I give to you that you love one another and even as I have loved you wow you are to love one another thank you Lord you remember that amen do you remember what I told him before patmas beloved let us love one another for love is from me and whoever loves is born of me and anyone who does not love does not know me because I am love so you see my little angels Christmas it's a time of love Jesus so good to see you [Applause] [Music] [Applause] wo like I was up there forever [Applause] you know when we understand how special we are we begin to see life so much more differently you know Isaiah wrote that it pleased the Lord to have Jesus be sacrificed it pleased God to have Jesus bruised to have him battered his brones his bones broken him hanging on the cross and buried in the Tomb it pleased him because he knew that with with that sacrifice he would gain all of us he would have his people back the gap between the Creator and the creation was no more and I understand that this is not the time that Jesus was born but we celebrate his birth because if it because if he did not come in that manger if he didn't come in the most humble of ways and carry that [Music] cross we'd all be lost there would be no hope but because of his love we are here today if we could sing and as we sing this song I'd like to invite the uh Phoenix Tabernacle Choir to come join me and I just ask you just to remember that when you're at your toughest times and life is just beating you down may you remember the [Music] grand for it was that love that changed you when you were unchangeable it was that love that loved you when you were unlovable oh thank you Lord amen let's just worship him this evening [Music] for me for the more for oh [Applause] the see are and me for [Applause] oh s i we I yes my heart GL [Music] [Applause] me
