[39:05] all of my children when I was here on
[39:07] earth and I told them that one day I
[39:09] would leave and I would send the
[39:11] comforter and he would be with them and
[39:14] even in them but they must do a couple
[39:19] of things yes that that is true for one
[39:23] they have to be willing to follow me
[39:27] that's all I'm willing to follow you
[39:29] Jesus are you yes what about you I am I
[39:32] am willing to follow you I am I'm ready
[39:35] yeah he's done everything he is like
[39:37] textbook he can speak in tongues yeah
[39:40] I'm ready to do all that speak in
[39:41] tongues you know I I want but the thing
[39:43] is we're working too hard we need to
[39:46] come back to the basics Lord that's what
[39:48] is it that's correct the basics are that
[39:52] you have to feed on my word see the new
[39:56] birth is not something of the flesh it
[39:59] deals with our spirit see as human
[40:02] beings we were unfortunately well you as
[40:06] humans um
[40:07] yes Lord you mean no thanks for
[40:11] reminding us Lord as human beings you
[40:14] were born with the incorrect spirit yeah
[40:17] and in order to see the kingdom and
[40:20] enter into the kingdom you must go
[40:24] through a process which is called the
[40:26] new birth yes sir it's an experience and
[40:29] you need to seek it every day of your
[40:32] life that's right not just one day not
[40:35] just one experience but every day of
[40:38] your life see you see that tree over
[40:40] there yes sir that is the tree of life
[40:44] I am the bread of life
[40:47] I am the tree of life my Bible is the
[40:51] bread of life you must feed on that and
[40:54] if you love me you will obey it
[40:58] see sometimes I feel like I'm so small
[41:01] I'm so inadequate like there's nothing
[41:03] in me that can ever compare to a tree of
[41:07] life but then I remember your words you
[41:09] said that just like a little mustard
[41:12] seed you said that everything that that
[41:16] tree will ever be was already in that
[41:19] little seed so if we just plant that
[41:24] seed in our heart no matter how small we
[41:28] may think it is well your word can fail
[41:32] so if we keep watering that seed then
[41:35] one day we'll be as strong and as
[41:38] impressive as this beautiful tree right
[41:40] Lord that's right and we have to work
[41:43] together although you see Ernie all the
[41:47] mommies and daddies out there mm-hmm
[41:49] they are responsible for planting those
[41:52] seeds and their children and they must
[41:56] help water and nurture that seed
[41:59] especially the mommies my servant Pastor
[42:04] Bernie always told his people that
[42:07] mommies are like the fifth gospel did
[42:10] you know that yeah did you know that
[42:12] yes mommy so let's give mommy's a round
[42:15] of applause
[42:20] so I think the way Ralph the way we look
[42:25] into ourselves we have to tap into the
[42:28] word which is that the Tree of Life you
[42:31] know and the way we can hear God's voice
[42:34] we have to read and read and and eat
[42:36] that word but we have to pray well
[42:39] that's how God talks to us and that's
[42:41] how you talk to him why do you know how
[42:44] to pray I mean I mean I well my parents
[42:48] never taught me how to pray but maybe
[42:51] you can teach me well well you know I
[42:54] have some friends there are air warriors
[42:56] yeah they're little and the prayers are
[42:59] simple but you know what prayers don't
[43:01] have to be too complicated I think we
[43:04] muddy the waters by complicating things
[43:06] we just got to be short and sweet God
[43:08] knows our heart and the most important
[43:10] thing Ralph look at me there you go

[1:00:57] candy right no no no we'll be okay so
[1:01:01] god bless you we truly enjoyed and
[1:01:04] appreciate that she came to support
[1:01:06] children's church you know it's
[1:01:09] something that we want to continue to do
[1:01:10] and we want to continue to just raise
[1:01:13] our children in God's environment in
[1:01:15] these difficult times so there was
[1:01:17] something I do want to mention before we
[1:01:19] go and you know sister Sharon and and
[1:01:23] sister Samara came up here and and they
[1:01:25] talked about bullying a little bit and I
[1:01:26] want to mention that I want to take the
[1:01:28] opportunity I want to make sure that all
[1:01:31] of us here in in our church that we
[1:01:34] never do that to anybody and and and how
[1:01:38] that is represented is that we treat
[1:01:40] somebody that is weaker than us that we
[1:01:45] mistreat them that we push them or that
[1:01:48] we kick them or that we touch them or
[1:01:50] that we do something
[1:01:53] that is invading their personal space
[1:01:56] okay so we want to make sure we don't do
[1:01:59] those things because those aren't the
[1:02:01] things that the Spirit of God in us does
[1:02:04] and we hurt people when we do that and
[1:02:07] that's called bullying how many of you
[1:02:08] guys have heard of bullying right you
[1:02:11] can you you can bully somebody
[1:02:13] physically by grabbing them or you can
[1:02:17] say bad things that come out of your
[1:02:19] mouth to hurt somebody just because you
[1:02:22] think that they're not like you or
[1:02:25] they're different than you and we
[1:02:26] shouldn't do that okay first of all
[1:02:30] because it's not right and it's not
[1:02:31] Christian like and second of all because
[1:02:34] it can get you in trouble okay and this
[1:02:36] goes for little boys big boys and bigger
[1:02:38] boys so make sure no bullying how many
[1:02:41] of you are not gonna bully a man raise
[1:02:44] your hands
[1:02:44] even you're not gonna believe Rajon
[1:02:47] there you go all right all right let us
[1:02:50] all stand so we can just pray if you
[1:02:52] would but let us pray those power heads
