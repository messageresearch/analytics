[18:29] hand.
[18:33] Amen.
[18:52] God bless each and every one of you.
[18:56] Uh wasn't that beautiful?
[19:00] Well, tonight we continue in our series
[19:02] of excerpts from the series of books
[19:05] entitled Supernatural: The Life of
[19:06] William Brham.
[19:08] Um, we're in book two, which is entitled
[19:11] The Young Man in His Desperation, 1933
[19:13] to 1946.
[19:15] Uh, this is our first installment in the
[19:17] new year 2017.
[19:19] Brother Owen Jurgensson pinned this
[19:21] work. It was a mighty work that he did,
[19:25] chronicling all of the sermons of
[19:27] brother Brandham that he listened to
[19:29] multiple times and interviewing many
[19:32] people and reading a lot of what had
[19:34] been written about brother Brandham to
[19:36] compile this series. It took him quite a
[19:38] few years to compile this series of
[19:40] books. The first book was extremely
[19:42] difficult for him as he nearly went
[19:45] bankrupt trying to make it happen. And
[19:48] then when it seemed like it would not
[19:50] happen before the first book was
[19:53] published, he had given up all hope, him
[19:55] and his wife are sitting at a dining
[19:57] room table one morning and his wife
[19:59] confessed to him that she had had a
[20:01] dream that someone would call.
[20:05] Sure enough, within a short period of
[20:07] time, he received that call from none
[20:09] other than our precious brother Perry
[20:11] Green, saying that he had nothing to
[20:13] worry about that this would get
[20:15] published.
[20:17] So, as we begin tonight in this chapter
[20:20] 26, we're in the second half of the
[20:22] chapter Lost on Hurricane Mountain.
[20:27] And before we get started
[20:29] to kind of bring you up to date here,
[20:33] one one comment I would make before we
[20:35] start this second half of this chapter.
[20:39] As as we all know, the Lord tests us
[20:41] many ways. He tests our faith, how
[20:45] devout we are, how much we really love
[20:47] him. And through all the trials he gives
[20:50] us, there is always something beautiful
[20:52] that comes out of that. He makes us
[20:54] stronger Christians. And so, I can
[20:57] honestly say that in the second half of
[20:58] this chapter, we learn and see that yes,
[21:02] we go through trials every day, but so
[21:04] did our prophet. and so did his newly
[21:07] formed family with sister Ma as well as
[21:11] as little Billy Paul.
[21:14] And so we pick up the story whereby they
[21:17] had uh taking a a family trip.
[21:21] Uh brother Billy uh Brandham had a a job
[21:24] to do and it happened to be on Hurricane
[21:27] Mountain. So they left early to embark
[21:30] on a hunting trip and he had had a
[21:34] conversation with Sister Ma knowing it
[21:35] was going to be pretty cold and the
[21:38] place that they wanted to stay at was
[21:39] closed. So they had to make do and they
[21:44] uh Brother Brandham used all all the
[21:46] wits that the Lord gave him to survive
[21:48] those first few nights. And then he one
[21:50] afternoon said to Sister Ma he needed to
[21:52] go out and and find some food for him.
[21:55] And so he had mentioned to her that that
[21:58] he knew his way quite well around
[22:00] Hurricane Mountain and that he felt like
[22:03] he would be okay, but Sister Mater gave
[22:04] him that I'm not sure sure glance. So
[22:07] we're at that moment
[22:09] and we pick up the story as Brother
[22:12] Brandham said he would be back by 2:00.
[22:14] He promised Sister Mum
[22:17] shoulder shouldering his rifle, he hiked
[22:20] back down the road until he came to a
[22:21] place that had been logged off years
[22:23] ago. Among the stumps and piles of
[22:26] leftover branches, new timber had since
[22:28] grown 15 feet high.
[22:31] This looked like the ideal habitat for
[22:33] deer. Plenty of food and lots of cover.
[22:36] Bill left the road and headed off
[22:38] through the forest. During the next
[22:40] hour, he saw lots of deer tracks, but
[22:42] they were all sharp towed, meaning they
[22:44] were doze. He needed a bug. As he
[22:47] crossed over a ridge and down into the
[22:49] next canyon, Bill heard something moving
[22:51] in the bushes. He stopped as still as a
[22:54] tree stump, listening. He distinctly
[22:56] heard feet crunching dry pine needles,
[22:59] not hooves. These were padded feet. Just
[23:02] then, the creature bolted. Bill glimpsed
[23:05] at a huge mountain lion darting into the
[23:07] thickets. He shouldered his rifle to
[23:09] aim, but the giant cat ran too quickly.
[23:12] Bill didn't have time to shoot before it
[23:14] was gone.
[23:16] Bill chased that mountain line for a
[23:17] mile down the canyon. But for a while he
[23:20] could hear it crashing through the thick
[23:22] underbrush, but soon the cat got too far
[23:25] ahead and Bill had to resort to his
[23:27] tracking skills, watching for footprints
[23:29] and bent twigs. Eventually the lion
[23:32] moved into the giant timber where it
[23:34] craftly took to running through the
[23:36] treetops. Bill lost the trail and gave
[23:38] up.
[23:40] He walked back up the canyon, but
[23:42] stopped when he sniffed the telltale
[23:43] odor of a male bear. Excitingly, he
[23:47] climbed the steep canyon wall into the
[23:48] wind, crossing over the ridge and down
[23:50] the other side. Several times he lost
[23:53] his scent, but he picked it up again.
[23:55] The ground flattened out. Bill kept
[23:57] walking, studying the terrain for clues
[23:59] such as an demolished antill or claw
[24:02] marks on a tree. He topped a ridge and
[24:04] moved down a shallow ravine. When he got
[24:08] to the bottom, the smell told him his
[24:10] quarry was near. Bill searched among the
[24:13] rocks and crevices until he found the
[24:15] bear's cave. There could be no mistaking
[24:17] it. The stench made his eyes water.
[24:20] Cautiously, he approached the dark
[24:21] opening, his rifle cocked and ready. The
[24:24] shallow cave was empty.
[24:27] Bill looked at his watch. The hands
[24:29] pushed 12:30.
[24:31] He would have to start back soon if he
[24:32] meant to kept it keep his promise to Ma.
[24:35] He didn't mind breaking off the hunt.
[24:38] Now that he knew the bear's haunts, he
[24:40] could come back as soon as he and Mr.
[24:41] Denton finished dismantling the
[24:43] telephone line up Hurricane Mountain.
[24:46] Starting up the ravine, he had gone just
[24:48] a little way when he saw a bush move
[24:50] across the canyon. There he is, Bill
[24:52] thought. He threw a shell up in the
[24:54] chamber and stood still. Instead of a
[24:56] bear, a majestic buck deer stepped into
[24:59] sight. Bill leveled his rifle and
[25:02] squeezed the trigger. The buck dropped
[25:04] where it stood.
[25:05] By the time Bill finished bleeding and
[25:07] gutting his kill, it was past 1:00. He
[25:10] strung the buck up by its hind legs to a
[25:13] tree limb, then hiked up the cannon as
[25:15] fast as the underbrush would let him
[25:17] walk. He noticed a cloud cover dropping.
[25:20] Hurricane Mountain was already veiled.
[25:22] He thought, "I'm going to have to hurry.
[25:25] That storm is getting close." He knew
[25:27] that if it turned foggy, he wouldn't be
[25:30] able to spot his landmarks. For 30
[25:32] minutes, he loped along, constantly
[25:35] looking for the spot where he had
[25:36] entered this particular canyon. Stopping
[25:39] to rest, he pulled his handkerchief from
[25:41] his pocket
[25:44] and wiped the perspiration from his
[25:46] face.
[25:47] That was a long way, he thought. I
[25:49] didn't think I came that far. Once more,
[25:52] he started jogging. In a few minutes, he
[25:54] stopped in complete surprise. There hung
[25:57] his deer.
[25:59] Well, what did I do? He muttered.
[26:01] Somewhere I missed my turn off, but how
[26:03] did I get turned around and back here?
[26:06] He started off again, thinking, "I'll
[26:08] get it right this time. I just wasn't
[26:10] paying enough attention." Walking
[26:12] briskly, he carefully searched for the
[26:14] spot where he had come down the steep
[26:16] slope. The clouds were just above the
[26:18] trees now. It was getting harder to
[26:20] recognize anything. After 40 minutes, he
[26:23] came across a place that looked
[26:24] familiar. In another minute, he knew
[26:27] why. There hung his deer in that tree.
[26:31] As Bill started out for a third time, he
[26:33] thought, "I can't make the same mistake
[26:36] three times in a row. But an hour later,
[26:38] he found himself back at his deer
[26:40] again."
[26:41] Tired and rattled, he sat down to rest
[26:44] and collect himself. He knew what was
[26:46] happening. The Indians called it the
[26:48] death walk. A man gets lost in the woods
[26:50] and wanders in circles until exhausted,
[26:52] he dies of exposure. If Bill had been in
[26:55] the mountains by himself, he would not
[26:57] have been worried. He would have simply
[26:59] gone back to that bear cave and
[27:00] hibernated until the storm blew itself
[27:02] out and the clouds lifted. Once his
[27:05] landmarks were in view, it would be a
[27:07] simple matter to make his way back to
[27:08] the cabin. But under the present
[27:10] circumstances, that plan was
[27:12] unthinkable. Ma had never been in the
[27:15] woods before in her life. She wouldn't
[27:17] know how to make a fire. If Bill didn't
[27:19] get back to camp, she and Billy Paul
[27:21] could easily freeze to death during the
[27:23] night. Moreover, she would be terrified
[27:25] of the dark. What if she heard an animal
[27:27] scream? She might think it was him and
[27:30] head out looking for him and get lost
[27:31] herself. Then Bill thought about that
[27:34] mountain lion stalking the woods near
[27:36] the lean tube.
[27:38] Franic with worry, Bill jumped up and
[27:40] tore through the thickets. Before long,
[27:41] he stopped himself, thinking, "Wait a
[27:43] minute, William Brandom. What's the
[27:45] matter with you? Have you gone crazy?"
[27:47] He had been a woodsman all his life. He
[27:50] knew what the biggest danger was in a
[27:52] situation like this. A man gets excited
[27:54] and charges recklessly through the
[27:56] forest. Then in the spring, someone
[27:58] finds his bones at the bottom of a
[27:59] cliff. He took a deep breath to calm his
[28:02] shaky nerves. "I've got to get a hold of
[28:05] myself," he thought. "I'm not really
[28:06] lost. I'm just a little disoriented. All
[28:09] I have to do is get my bearings." The
[28:11] fog had settled completely now, and
[28:13] everything looked unfamiliar. To make
[28:15] matters more difficult, it had started
[28:17] to snow. Worst of all, the sun was going
[28:19] down, and darkness was coming on fast.
[28:22] If he didn't find his way out soon, he
[28:24] wouldn't find his way out at all. Then
[28:27] all three of them would perish in the
[28:29] night. Struggling to stay calm, Bill
[28:31] thought. I can't be lost. I'm too good a
[28:34] woodsman to be lost. Think a minute.
[28:37] When I came in here, the wind was in my
[28:39] face. That's it. All I've got to do is
[28:42] keep the wind at my back and I can get
[28:43] out. He headed in the opposite direction
[28:46] of the wind. All he could see around him
[28:48] were the shadowy shapes of nearby trees
[28:50] and bushes swirling in the fog and snow.
[28:53] Every so often the fickle wind would
[28:55] shift directions. Soon it became obvious
[28:57] that the wind curling as it did around
[29:00] the mountain peaks would not do for a
[29:01] compass. To bolster his courage and keep
[29:04] himself calm, Bill said out loud,
[29:07] "You're not lost. You know where you're
[29:09] at." But his conscience caught his
[29:12] bluff. Billy, you know you've lost. He
[29:16] answered himself, "Me? Not me. I can't
[29:19] get lost." Then he came across a giant
[29:22] stump that he knew he had never passed
[29:25] before. He started shaking. Perspiration
[29:28] ran down his face. "There's no need of
[29:31] fooling yourself any longer," he
[29:32] thought. "You're lost," admitted.
[29:36] It was not the blow to his pride that
[29:39] hurt. It was the terror he felt for his
[29:41] wife and son. "I'm really lost," he said
[29:44] to himself. I don't know east from west.
[29:47] I've got to choose a direction and walk
[29:49] it straight because as it is, I'm
[29:51] walking in a circle. So, I'm going to
[29:53] walk this way. Picking a direction at
[29:56] random, he started walking, paying close
[29:58] attention to the few trees that he could
[30:00] see, trying to walk in a straight line
[30:02] from tree to tree. As he walked, he
[30:04] seemed to hear a voice whisper, "The
[30:07] Lord is our refuge and strength, a very
[30:10] present help in time of trouble.
[30:15] Bill thought, "Now I'm getting crazy.
[30:17] I'm hearing things." He kept walking,
[30:20] concentrating as hard as he could on his
[30:22] mission. Soon he heard it again, a
[30:24] little louder than before. "The Lord is
[30:26] our refuge and strength, a very present
[30:29] help in time of trouble." Bill kept
[30:31] walking, dragging his gun along. He felt
[30:34] so tired. The persistent voice got
[30:36] louder. "The Lord is our refuge and
[30:39] strength."
[30:40] Bill stopped and said out loud, "Lord
[30:43] Jesus, I'm lost. I've got no compass or
[30:46] landmarks, but I've still got you, Lord,
[30:50] I'm not worthy to live, but please don't
[30:53] let my wife and son die." Then he heard
[30:55] that voice again. It was not his
[30:57] imagination. He heard it clearly with
[30:59] his ears. "The Lord is our refuge and
[31:02] strength, a very present help in time of
[31:04] trouble."
[31:06] Leading his rifle against the tree, Bill
[31:08] pulled off his hat, dropped it on the
[31:10] snow, and knelt on top of it. Looking
[31:13] up, he prayed. Heavenly Father, I
[31:15] thought I knew all about the woods, but
[31:18] I was mistaken. I know I'm going wrong,
[31:21] but I don't know which way to turn. I've
[31:24] been such a braggard. I deserve to be
[31:26] lost. I deserve to stay out here for
[31:28] days and have to eat porcupines to
[31:30] survive. But Lord, my poor wife is
[31:33] innocent. She and my son will die
[31:35] tonight if I don't get out of here.
[31:37] Father, it's almost dark and I'm lost.
[31:39] Totally lost. Please help me. Be my
[31:42] compass and my guide.
[31:45] Getting back up, he shook the snow from
[31:47] his cap and then said, "Lord, I believe
[31:49] that voice that whispered to me was your
[31:51] voice. I believe there is an angel of
[31:53] God somewhere following me through this
[31:56] forest. Lord, I've asked you for
[31:58] guidance. That's all I can do. Now, I'm
[32:01] starting this way.
[32:03] He started walking in the same direction
[32:05] he had been going before. Suddenly, he
[32:08] felt a hand on his shoulder pulling him
[32:09] back as if to stop him. Frightened, Bill
[32:12] twisted his head to see who it was. No
[32:15] one was there, but even as he looked,
[32:17] the fall cleared for a moment, and he
[32:19] glimpsed Hurricane Mountain behind him.
[32:22] That was the way to safety. He had been
[32:24] heading dead away from it. He had just
[32:26] enough time to swing around and line
[32:28] himself up with the mountain before the
[32:30] fog filled in again. Raising his hand,
[32:32] Bill cried out, "Oh, great Jehovah God,
[32:35] you're so close to me that you laid your
[32:37] hand on my shoulder. You truly are my
[32:40] help in time of trouble." Bill climbed
[32:42] through the foggy twilight just as
[32:44] straight as he could in the direction of
[32:46] Hurricane Mountain, watching every
[32:47] second lest he veer off course. The
[32:50] forest dim tonight. Bill walked with one
[32:53] arm always up in the air, searching just
[32:55] above his head for that telephone line,
[32:57] which ran from tree to tree for 5 miles
[32:59] up the side of the mountain. If he could
[33:01] just get his hand on one of these two
[33:03] wires, he could follow it down the
[33:05] mountain side right to the cabin. If he
[33:08] missed those wires, he, his wife, and
[33:10] his son would perish. For the next 3
[33:13] hours, he kept his course, sometimes
[33:15] having to pick his way straight up rocky
[33:17] bluffs. The snow flurries had become a
[33:20] blizzard. The wind howled, tearing off
[33:22] tree limbs. Bill carried his rifle in
[33:24] one hand and held the other above his
[33:26] head until his arm felt as heavy as a
[33:28] shotgun barrel. Then he would trade
[33:31] hands, always being careful to step back
[33:32] a few paces, just before continuing to
[33:36] be certain that he hadn't missed that
[33:37] telephone line during the switch.
[33:40] Sometimes his hand would brush up
[33:41] against an object and he would shout,
[33:43] "I've got it." But he had only grabbed a
[33:46] tree limb, his fingers numbed in his
[33:48] gloves. Eventually, he got so he could
[33:51] barely hold up either arm. Yet he had to
[33:53] keep an arm up. Three lives depended on
[33:56] it. By now, the night was so black he
[33:59] could barely see the snow swirling in
[34:01] front of his face. He grew
[34:02] faint-hearted. What if he had gone
[34:05] through a low place where the wires
[34:06] stretched from tree to tree across a
[34:08] dip, making them higher than his
[34:10] upstretched arm could touch? If that
[34:12] happened, then they were all doomed. His
[34:15] arm bumped something springy. He pulled
[34:17] down his hand until his fingers curled
[34:19] around a thin wire. He had found it. He
[34:22] was saved. They were all three saved.
[34:26] Bill dropped his rifle, snatched off his
[34:28] hat, and gave thanks. Oh, God, what a
[34:31] feeling it is to be found when you're
[34:33] lost. How can I ever thank you enough?
[34:36] Right down at the end of this wire sends
[34:38] everything in this life that I hold
[34:40] dear, my wife and my son. This telephone
[34:43] line will be my guide off the mountain.
[34:46] I won't let go of this wire for nothing
[34:48] in the world. But really, Lord Jesus,
[34:51] you're my guide, and I intend to hold on
[34:53] to you for the rest of my life because I
[34:56] know at the end is warmth and safety and
[34:59] rest.
[35:03] God bless you.
[35:04] Amen.
[35:07] [Applause]
[35:22] God bless you.
[35:27] Uh that's one of my favorite chapters in
[35:29] the whole books.
[35:35] I feel I I get excited every time I hear
[35:37] it
[35:39] to see how when you humble yourself,
[35:43] God answers.
[35:46] Amen.
[35:46] Welcome to Children's Church.
[35:49] To all the children
[35:52] and the children at heart,
[35:54] welcome to your service.
[35:58] Uh we are here to pray for the
[35:59] petitions,
[36:02] the thanksgivings,
[36:04] but we don't have any written down.
[36:08] But I know that all of us are thankful
[36:10] for something, right?
[36:13] I know I'm thankful because I'm here.
[36:18] I'm still alive.
[36:20] I'm healthy.
[36:22] I have my two legs,
[36:24] my two feet.
[36:26] I can walk and when so many people
[36:29] can't.
[36:32] I have food on my table.
[36:34] I have my parents.
[36:36] I still have my grandparents,
[36:39] uncles,
[36:41] friends, amigos.
[36:43] So, it's little things
[36:46] that we should be grateful for
[36:49] and all of those are blessings.
[36:53] So, I know that if you think hard
[36:57] You might find something to be grateful
[36:59] for.
[37:03] I'm uh a little surprised to see a
[37:05] little people here.
[37:08] But as I was thinking about this back
[37:10] there,
[37:12] I was thinking about the story story of
[37:14] Gideon,
[37:17] how you know with his small band of men,
[37:22] he was able to secure a great blessing.
[37:27] So that teaches me
[37:30] that God doesn't deal in numbers.
[37:33] Even though there's a few of us here,
[37:36] there's a purpose for that.
[37:38] There's a blessing for that.
[37:41] So let's just open our hearts
[37:45] and let's just expect
[37:48] to see what God has for us.
[37:51] We can please uh before I pray,
[37:54] I would like uh once again
[37:57] uh to greet our pastor,
[38:00] brother Bernie,
[38:02] Sister Lily, Lily,
[38:04] the watching us
[38:06] and I'm grateful for that
[38:09] because they're still with us.
[38:11] So we'll be praying for the petitions.
[38:13] If you can please stand to your feet.
[38:17] If you have a thanksgiving,
[38:19] a petition in your heart
[38:22] and would like to show it by your lips
[38:23] and your hand.
[38:26] And if you can close your eyes,
[38:29] concentrate on him
[38:32] and pray with me.
[38:34] Let my words be your words.
[38:37] Let us be in one accord.
[38:40] And let us get the Holy Spirit down
[38:41] here.
[38:44] Our
[38:45] heavenly father,
[38:48] thank you so much Lord
[38:50] for your kindness,
[38:52] for your mercy
[38:54] that we still have.
[38:57] We can't we take it for granted
[38:58] sometimes Lord.
[39:02] But thank you for your mercy, Lord.
[39:05] We have your people here.
[39:08] They have lifted your hands.
[39:11] They have a thanksgiving.
[39:14] They may have a petition.
[39:17] Only you know that Lord.
[39:20] So we ask Lord
[39:22] that as the allseeing God,
[39:26] may you grant their petition.
[39:29] May you give him the faith to accept it
[39:33] and to believe it, Lord.
[39:35] May you accept their thanksgiving.
[39:39] And may you continue to bless them,
[39:40] Lord.
[39:43] so they can testify
[39:46] of your goodness, of your power, of your
[39:50] mercy. Lord,
[39:52] at this moment we would like to pray
[39:53] also for the offering.
[39:58] May you bless it and multiply it,
[40:00] Father.
[40:02] And may you bless a cheerful giver,
[40:05] in the precious name of the Lord Jesus
[40:06] Christ, we pray to you at this moment.
[40:10] In the name of the Lord Jesus Christ.
[40:13] Amen.
[40:14] Amen.
[40:17] Amen. God bless you once again.

[40:22] abides. Amen.

[51:58] I have a little slideshow.
[52:04] So the title of the message today
[52:07] is using our words for God.
[52:12] All you kids, how many want to use your
[52:14] words for God?
[52:18] We want to use our words for God.
[52:22] We don't have a lot of things
[52:25] that we have control of.
[52:28] But we can control
[52:31] what we say.
[52:33] We can't control what people tell us.
[52:37] Sometimes we can't control what we hear,
[52:42] but we can control what comes out of our
[52:44] mouth
[52:47] if we try.
[52:53] What' you say?
[52:55] Well, he made me say it.
[52:59] Really?
[53:00] He He might have hurt you.
[53:02] He might have bothered you,
[53:05] but he didn't make you say anything,
[53:09] right?
[53:12] Next slide.
[53:15] So what we want to do today,
[53:19] we could move to the next slide, please,
[53:23] is what we're going to do is we're going
[53:25] to read our scriptures.
[53:28] Cuz children, if you learn anything,
[53:32] in church, we have to read our
[53:36] scriptures.
[53:38] for it to be church, for it to be a
[53:40] service.
[53:42] We want to know what God says.
[53:46] Amen.
[53:47] Amen.
[53:47] And the only way we can know what God
[53:49] says
[53:52] is to go to his word.
[53:54] So, we're going to be reading James
[53:56] 3:10,
[53:59] and then we're going to be having a
[54:02] short little story
[54:06] for my wife Lizzie
[54:08] about how she used her words in one time
[54:14] when she was a little kid.
[54:17] And then we want to talk about how can
[54:19] we do this?
[54:22] How can we use our words for God?
[54:26] And then we're gonna have another
[54:28] scripture
[54:31] that'll give us an example.
[54:33] So, we can go um to the next slide,
[54:35] please.
[54:37] And while we read this scripture, I'm
[54:39] going to ask the love of my life,
[54:40] Lizzie, to come up.
[54:45] The love of my life,
[54:47] Lizzy. Thank you. Gracias.
[54:51] James
[54:52] Santiago,
[54:53] can somebody read this for me? Can I get
[54:54] a brave uh volunteer to read this
[54:56] scripture for me?
[54:59] Probably a beautiful one. There she is.
[55:00] A beautiful.
[55:02] A beautiful volunteer.
[55:04] Can you give her a round of applause,
[55:05] please?
[55:09] Thank you.
[55:12] Out of the same mouth prophecies brought
[55:16] blessings and cursing. My brethren,
[55:19] these things ought not
[55:22] so be.
[55:34] And I'm going to ask you what you think
[55:35] that means.
[55:38] From the same mouth
[55:41] comes blessings
[55:43] and cursing.
[55:46] My brothers, this should not be.
[55:51] So what does that mean? Out of the same
[55:53] mouth
[55:55] and cursings.
[56:00] You got an answer.
[56:02] So it means like when you say something,
[56:04] it can be something good or something
[56:07] bad.
[56:08] Oh, good girl.
[56:14] So out of this mouth will out of this
[56:18] mouth. Out of your mouth,
[56:22] out of their mouths,
[56:23] out of all of our mouths,
[56:26] we say good things
[56:29] and bad things,
[56:31] blessings
[56:32] and cursing.
[56:35] Then he says, "My brothers,
[56:38] this should not be."
[56:40] Can you give her a round of applause?
[56:43] Thank you, Miha.
[56:46] So, come over here, my love. you can go
[56:49] ahead and grab a a microphone. My
[56:51] beautiful wife Lizzie
[56:54] when she was a when she was a little
[56:56] girl,
[56:58] she was feisty
[57:01] and she has a nice little story
[57:06] of how she used her words
[57:10] in a bad way
[57:12] and how it made her feel
[57:16] and the consequences.
[57:20] So, when I was um a little kid,
[57:25] one day
[57:27] I got a few rolls of toilet paper
[57:34] um of toilet paper and when nobody was
[57:36] there,
[57:38] I went and I pushed them all down the
[57:40] toilet.
[57:44] And what happened was it clogged the
[57:46] toilet.
[57:49] So that the water was coming up.
[57:54] So my dad found out
[57:58] and he started asking who did this.
[58:02] Now I have one sister and two brothers
[58:06] and I didn't want to say it was me.
[58:10] So he asked everybody and everybody said
[58:12] they didn't do it.
[58:16] And he lined us up the bathroom
[58:19] next to the toilet and said, "I want you
[58:21] to tell me the truth before God who did
[58:23] it."
[58:28] I said, "No, Daddy,
[58:31] do it."
[58:32] So he changed his tactic
[58:36] and he said, "Okay,
[58:38] you're not going to get in trouble.
[58:41] Whoever did it,
[58:43] if you tell me the truth,
[58:46] I'm going to give you candy
[58:49] so you can tell the truth.
[58:52] So all of a sudden I got very happy
[58:56] cuz I knew I did it.
[58:59] But then my brothers and sisters started
[59:02] saying that they did it too.
[59:07] So my dad had to take us into the room
[59:09] one at a time
[59:12] and we had to tell him the story of how
[59:14] he did it.
[59:17] And when it came my turn to tell the
[59:19] truth,
[59:21] I told him and he didn't believe me.
[59:26] And it ended up
[59:28] that they believed my brother's story
[59:33] more than me.
[59:35] And I was so upset
[59:39] because if id known that my words would
[59:41] have lost me the candy if I'd lied the
[59:43] first time,
[59:49] then I wouldn't have lied.
[59:53] But then I lost candy.
[59:56] My word wasn't believable anymore.
[59:59] So when I when I asked her, "So what
[1:00:01] what lesson did you learn, babe?
[1:00:05] She said that my brother was a better
[1:00:07] liar than me.
[1:00:11] But the the moral of the story that I
[1:00:13] wanted to get at
[1:00:15] [Music]
[1:00:18] as kids,
[1:00:20] brother Brandham says we're born liars.
[1:00:25] The word says we come into this world
[1:00:26] speaking lies,
[1:00:30] but it's always better just to tell the
[1:00:33] truth.
[1:00:36] How many want to speak the truth?
[1:00:41] Amen. I love all these little kids
[1:00:42] raising their hands.
[1:00:45] But sometimes it's not always just what
[1:00:48] you say.
[1:00:51] Sometimes it's what you don't. And I was
[1:00:52] looking around
[1:00:54] And I saw this beautiful big.
[1:00:59] It looked like a bad guy.
[1:01:02] I don't like the way that looked at me.
[1:01:07] [Music]
[1:01:12] I cut off his arm.
[1:01:14] That wasn't good enough.
[1:01:16] No, no, no, no. He was asking for
[1:01:18] trouble.
[1:01:21] I cut off his other arm.
[1:01:24] I said, "Are you still looking at me?
[1:01:27] I hit him in the head. Poked it in the
[1:01:29] eye. I tore off his legs.
[1:01:34] I was the coolest ninja ever.
[1:01:39] That poor little was beat up to shreds.
[1:01:45] I was walking around all cool.
[1:01:49] I thought I was awesome.
[1:01:53] Then I walked into grandma's house.
[1:02:01] Me and my brother Johnny were standing
[1:02:02] there.
[1:02:05] I had done it by myself.
[1:02:07] Johnny wasn't even there.
[1:02:10] I don't even think he knows what is.
[1:02:17] one of you destroyed my
[1:02:23] I didn't say nothing
[1:02:26] right before I opened my mouth to
[1:02:28] confess
[1:02:30] because her Castillo eyes were tearing
[1:02:32] me up.
[1:02:37] I was right about to open my mouth
[1:02:39] and she looked at Johnny and she said,
[1:02:41] "Did you do it, Johnny?"
[1:02:44] He goes, "Yay!
[1:02:47] And I thought, I'm off the hook.
[1:02:51] I know he didn't do it. He probably
[1:02:54] didn't even know what she was talking
[1:02:55] about,
[1:02:58] but he was so used to doing it.
[1:03:01] He was so used to getting in trouble
[1:03:03] anyway.
[1:03:05] I let him take one for the team.
[1:03:09] And to this day,
[1:03:12] grandma, if you're watching, knows me.
[1:03:15] I'm sorry.
[1:03:17] I love you.
[1:03:18] Well, my brother Johnny got in trouble.
[1:03:22] Now, somebody might say,
[1:03:25] "You didn't lie.
[1:03:27] Your brother messed up for snitching on
[1:03:29] himself.
[1:03:33] Withholding information isn't the same
[1:03:35] as lying."
[1:03:40] [Music]
[1:03:42] What do you guys think? No, don't say
[1:03:44] anything. Just think about it. Did I
[1:03:45] lie?
[1:03:47] And even if you don't think I lie, did I
[1:03:49] do something wrong?
[1:03:53] Did I do something right?
[1:03:55] Is there a gray area?
[1:03:58] What would God wanted me to do?
[1:04:03] Tell the truth. Thank you.
[1:04:06] Exactly.
[1:04:08] Amen. I should have told the truth.
[1:04:13] Well,
[1:04:15] years later,
[1:04:17] I felt really bad for it.
[1:04:20] So, whenever somebody says, "Oh, if you
[1:04:21] get away with it, it's okay."
[1:04:26] When you're older, it'll tear you up.
[1:04:30] So, let's just tell the truth. Amen.
[1:04:33] Let's use our words for God.
[1:04:36] Let's go to the next slide, please.
[1:04:40] So, I have a question for you.
[1:04:43] How can we use our words for God?
[1:04:47] You got an answer? Come on up. If you
[1:04:50] think you have an answer, raise your
[1:04:51] hand and I'll request. How can we use
[1:04:54] our words for God? Come on.
[1:04:57] Can we give these little boys a round of
[1:04:58] applause there? Praise.
[1:05:01] Somebody else.
[1:05:03] How can we use our words for God?
[1:05:07] Come on. Come on.
[1:05:09] Okay. Can you stand up here, handsome,
[1:05:11] and tell everybody your name?
[1:05:15] This is Corey.
[1:05:16] This is Corey.
[1:05:16] How can we use our words for God, buddy?
[1:05:19] We could pray.
[1:05:22] Can you give him a round of applause?
[1:05:25] We can pray.
[1:05:28] Go ahead. Stand right over there.
[1:05:30] Can you tell everybody your name, buddy?
[1:05:32] Adam.
[1:05:33] Adam. How can we use our words for God?
[1:05:37] We could we could um use our words good
[1:05:42] so we can't so so so we can't get in
[1:05:46] trouble.
[1:05:46] Wow. Say good things. Use our words.
[1:05:53] [Applause]
[1:05:57] too.
[1:05:58] My name is Christian.
[1:06:00] Christian, let's turn around this way so
[1:06:01] everybody can see you.
[1:06:04] How can we use our words for God?
[1:06:07] We could use our words for God for
[1:06:08] blessing his holy name.
[1:06:10] Wow. By blessing his holy name.
[1:06:14] Can you give him a round of applause?
[1:06:19] So, we can pray.
[1:06:22] We can say good things.
[1:06:24] We can bless his holy name.
[1:06:27] I love those answers.
[1:06:30] Your voice may have a seat. Give them
[1:06:31] one more round of applause.
[1:06:34] Awesome.
[1:06:37] Yeah.
[1:06:38] So, what else can we do?
[1:06:42] We can read our scripture.
[1:06:47] We can be polite.
[1:06:50] We can pray for somebody who's sick.
[1:06:57] We can give somebody a compliment,
[1:07:01] build somebody up.
[1:07:05] Wow. Congratulate somebody.
[1:07:08] Like whenever we use our words
[1:07:13] to build up
[1:07:16] a child of God,
[1:07:18] then we're doing it for God.
[1:07:22] Because the Bible says, "Whatever you do
[1:07:28] to the smallest of my children,
[1:07:32] you're doing unto me."
[1:07:36] Amen.
[1:07:36] Amen.
[1:07:38] Wow. So whatever I do to the smallest
[1:07:40] little kid here,
[1:07:44] if I make him feel bad,
[1:07:47] if I'm like, "Those shoes are whack."
[1:07:52] And I make them feel bad,
[1:07:55] then I'm making God feel bad.
[1:08:00] The Bible says it's better
[1:08:03] to tie a big old rock on your neck
[1:08:09] and throw it in the ocean
[1:08:12] than to offend one of his children.
[1:08:16] Wow. So, let's use our words
[1:08:20] to build people up.
[1:08:24] Amen.
[1:08:25] Amen.
[1:08:26] Amen.
[1:08:26] Amen.
[1:08:28] Amen. Thank you.
[1:08:30] I also like that last quote he said to
[1:08:32] bless his holy name.
[1:08:36] How do we bless his holy name? Church.
[1:08:39] You got an answer.
[1:08:41] How? He's like, "No, no, no. How can we
[1:08:44] bless his holy name?"
[1:08:47] By what?
[1:08:48] They said singing.
[1:08:50] Can we sing for the Lord?
[1:08:54] Everybody say hallelujah.
[1:08:56] Hallelujah.
[1:08:57] Say thank you Lord.
[1:09:00] Say bless the Lord.
[1:09:04] Oh my soul.
[1:09:06] Oh Almia
[1:09:07] and all that is within me. Bless his
[1:09:12] holy
[1:09:17] name.
[1:09:20] That is using our voice and our words.
[1:09:26] Amen. The Bible says, "His praise shall
[1:09:28] forever be in my mouth."
[1:09:33] Amen. Who wants to have his praises in
[1:09:36] their mouth?
[1:09:39] You want to know another way we can use
[1:09:41] our words for
[1:09:45] by saying,
[1:09:46] "Amen."
[1:09:47] Amen.
[1:09:48] Amen. Amen. Woo. To every word of God,
[1:09:53] you say, "Amen."
[1:09:55] Amen.
[1:09:56] That's a simple recipe.
[1:09:59] You want to learn how to get in the
[1:10:00] spirit,
[1:10:03] say amen.
[1:10:04] Amen.
[1:10:06] Amen.
[1:10:06] Amen. If the preacher says something
[1:10:11] and even if even if it's not yours yet,
[1:10:16] but you want it,
[1:10:17] you could say, "Amen." Amen.
[1:10:20] For example, if you're sick and you're
[1:10:21] like, "Oh, I'm so sick."
[1:10:25] And the and you hear in the word of God,
[1:10:29] God is a healer
[1:10:32] and he died for you.
[1:10:35] He got whipped so you can be healed.
[1:10:40] You can sit there and say, "Oh, that
[1:10:42] sounds good. I believe."
[1:10:45] But the minute you hear it
[1:10:47] and you decide that you want to believe
[1:10:49] it
[1:10:51] and you say amen. Amen. That word amen
[1:10:57] means so be it.
[1:11:00] Means let it be.
[1:11:02] Means I agree.
[1:11:05] that's for me.
[1:11:07] And your body
[1:11:09] has to obey.
[1:11:13] Amen.
[1:11:13] Amen.
[1:11:15] So that's a simple little thing.
[1:11:18] One time I was in I was driving in the
[1:11:19] car
[1:11:21] and I was tired.
[1:11:24] I was like, man, I got to go to school.
[1:11:27] It's like a 50-minute drive.
[1:11:31] I was at a red light.
[1:11:34] And this car pulled up next to me.
[1:11:37] It's like
[1:11:39] the bones.
[1:11:49] Oh my lord.
[1:11:50] Seenor.
[1:11:51] Oh my lord.
[1:11:53] Seenor.
[1:11:54] Oh my lord. The steering wheels right
[1:11:56] there. I'm like,
[1:12:00] so I put my windows up.
[1:12:03] I put my music on,
[1:12:06] some Christian music
[1:12:08] and I wasn't feeling anything, right? I
[1:12:09] wasn't
[1:12:12] just listening to Christian music.
[1:12:15] And all of a sudden,
[1:12:17] the lyric
[1:12:19] said something.
[1:12:22] They said, "If I told you my story,
[1:12:28] you would hear love or something like
[1:12:31] that." Okay. Has anybody heard that song
[1:12:33] that I'm talking about?
[1:12:35] If I told you my story, I'm listening to
[1:12:37] it.
[1:12:40] And I said, "Yeah, my story is kind of
[1:12:43] like that, too."
[1:12:46] And I said, "Amen. Amen."
[1:12:49] And immediately
[1:12:51] the entire atmosphere in my car changed.
[1:12:55] My face was like pouring tears.
[1:13:00] I had so much energy
[1:13:03] because the Holy Spirit
[1:13:06] was was listening to me say amen.
[1:13:12] And then then then then the power of the
[1:13:13] Holy Ghost
[1:13:15] and the anointing that was in that song
[1:13:19] came into my heart.
[1:13:21] And I remembered all the amazing things
[1:13:22] God did for me
[1:13:26] just by using a powerful word.
[1:13:31] Amen. Amen.
[1:13:34] Amen. Amen.
[1:13:35] Words are powerful. Amen.
[1:13:38] God loves you.
[1:13:42] Somebody caught it. Somebody said,
[1:13:43] "Amen."
[1:13:45] They know. They know God loves them.
[1:13:47] God loves you.
[1:13:49] [Applause]
[1:13:50] We're victorious.
[1:13:54] He fills us with his love.
[1:13:57] He's a healer.
[1:13:59] He'll never leave you.
[1:14:03] Amen.
[1:14:05] Amen.
[1:14:06] Next slide, please.
[1:14:10] Um the one right before that the the P.
[1:14:14] There you go. Amen. Oh, actually that's
[1:14:16] after, isn't it?
[1:14:18] You can go back. I'm sorry. Thank you.
[1:14:20] Thank you. To the Psalms. Psalms 63. My
[1:14:25] My bad. Thank you. Psalm 63:7.
[1:14:30] Just going to read it really really
[1:14:31] quick. Okay, guys.
[1:14:33] For you have been my help
[1:14:37] and in the shadow of your wings
[1:14:41] I will sing for joy.
[1:14:46] For you, Lord, have been my help.
[1:14:51] And in the shadow of your wings,
[1:14:55] I'll sing for joy.
[1:14:59] I will sing for joy.
[1:15:02] Next slide.
[1:15:05] This little kid here,
[1:15:07] Willie Mir.
[1:15:08] Willie Mir.
[1:15:10] I I talked about him before,
[1:15:13] but there's a link, but I don't think
[1:15:15] it's going to work because the internet
[1:15:16] right now. So, I'll just tell you the
[1:15:17] story short.
[1:15:21] This little kid's 10 years old.
[1:15:25] Who's 10 years old here?
[1:15:28] Is there a 10year-old amongst us?
[1:15:32] 9 years old.
[1:15:34] Nine years old. Can you stand up for me,
[1:15:36] buddy? Please say
[1:15:42] more or less the age of this kid.
[1:15:44] This young man,
[1:15:46] thank you. You can have a seat. Willie
[1:15:49] was 10 years old played in his front
[1:15:51] yard
[1:15:53] and somebody came and kidnapped him.
[1:15:57] They came and they grabbed him and they
[1:15:58] put him in the car.
[1:16:01] and said, "You close your mouth. You
[1:16:04] don't say nothing and you sit there."
[1:16:07] And he started driving for hours. He
[1:16:11] drove
[1:16:13] and the entire time
[1:16:15] little Willie was singing praises
[1:16:20] and it made the news. He was giving his
[1:16:22] testimony on the news.
[1:16:25] He's saying, "Every praise is to our
[1:16:28] God.
[1:16:31] Every You guys know the song? Every word
[1:16:34] of worship in one accord.
[1:16:39] Can you sing it? Every praise is to our
[1:16:42] God.
[1:16:43] Every praise is to our God. Every word
[1:16:48] in one accord. He's singing in the back
[1:16:50] of the car.
[1:16:53] And the bad guy, "Hey, be quiet over
[1:16:55] there.
[1:16:57] Close your mouth.
[1:16:58] Don't be singing that stuff.
[1:17:01] He just sang and sang and sang
[1:17:04] until he couldn't take it anymore.
[1:17:07] What am I going to do with this kid?
[1:17:10] He couldn't take it.
[1:17:12] The devil can't stand when you begin to
[1:17:14] worship.
[1:17:18] Sometimes we're kidnapped
[1:17:21] spiritually. Our mind has been stricken
[1:17:24] from us.
[1:17:26] Our
[1:17:28] joy has been taken away from us,
[1:17:32] our health, our family, our hope, our
[1:17:37] faith,
[1:17:39] our strength
[1:17:41] has been kidnapped.
[1:17:44] But the devil can't take it.
[1:17:48] When you open your mouth
[1:17:51] and worship the Lord.
[1:17:55] Somebody say amen.
[1:17:58] Someone say amen.
[1:18:00] The devil can't stand for you to say
[1:18:02] amen.
[1:18:04] And just for that, let's say it again.
[1:18:08] Amen. Come on, devil. We got a bone to
[1:18:10] pick with you.
[1:18:12] We're children of the living God.
[1:18:16] Amen.
[1:18:17] Amen. So he's just singing and singing
[1:18:19] and singing
[1:18:21] and the bad guy's like
[1:18:27] gets out,
[1:18:29] opens the door,
[1:18:31] get out of the car.
[1:18:33] Stay there and don't tell anybody what I
[1:18:35] said. And he took off.
[1:18:39] He left them.
[1:18:41] Abandoned ship.
[1:18:44] There's a crazy worshipper here.
[1:18:47] This kid actually believes
[1:18:50] in the power of worship.
[1:18:53] There's crazy believers in Phoenix
[1:18:54] Tabernacle
[1:18:57] that actually believe
[1:18:59] in the power of worship.
[1:19:02] Oh,
[1:19:02] hallelujah.
[1:19:03] Amen.
[1:19:04] Amen.
[1:19:05] Amen. Is there crazy people here that
[1:19:07] actually believe in the power of worship
[1:19:12] where two or more are gathered
[1:19:16] in his name?
[1:19:18] He will be there too.
[1:19:21] And kids, you don't have to be old.
[1:19:24] In fact, don't wait till you get old,
[1:19:26] please.
[1:19:29] What the world wants to see
[1:19:31] is kids like you.
[1:19:34] Kids like you, Mi,
[1:19:37] young ladies like you
[1:19:40] worshiping the Lord.
[1:19:43] I'm already too old.
[1:19:45] That's not very much. It's not
[1:19:46] impressive for me.
[1:19:49] But if you guys stand for the Lord,
[1:19:52] the devil, when the smallest Christian
[1:19:54] gets on the
[1:19:58] devil and his demons are
[1:20:02] get out the car.
[1:20:05] I messing with you. Be crazy. How many
[1:20:09] want to be crazy for the Lord? Last
[1:20:12] slide, please.
[1:20:16] Let's use our words
[1:20:18] to pray,
[1:20:20] to say scripture,
[1:20:22] to tell the truth,
[1:20:25] to bless people,
[1:20:27] to be positive,
[1:20:30] say kind words,
[1:20:32] make people feel better,
[1:20:36] and sing God's praises.
[1:20:40] God bless you.
