granddaughter Scarlet Garcia May everything come out fine with her blood exams also our sister Claudia pz Gomez ask for prayer these are all the petitions we have [Music] written but if you want to indicate your petition you can raise your hand and tell the Lord I have a petition truly we are the most needy people but the prophet says in the message in your word Lord at Thy word Lord that God cannot do anything he can't heal us he can't save us if we don't accept it first if we don't believe it and also if we don't confess it you will never live above your confession so as long as we each of us confess what we have accepted and believed did for us back in that day at Calvary for every one of us so when you confess Satan he cannot resist that word he can't resist that confession that you will do before God and God is obligated to his word he is not obligated to ours but his word being confessed through our lips will be arriving to manifestation maybe you may worsen maybe the situation can get more terrible but what God Said continue to confess it until it arrives to its fulfillment when we don't know but we do know that God fulfills his word let us pray let us place these petition and the petition that you placed in your heart we will be also praying for Tidings and offerings and if you can be kind as to byow your heads close your [Music] eyes let's [Music] pray [Music] we want to focus our full attention exclusively on the Lord Jesus Christ this [Music] morning for he's the one who who loved us and he washed our sins in his own blood and he gave us access he sent us a Lifeline to the father so that we could approach him at a time like this in a place like this where we're all gathered all together and we have needs that we want to present to him so we want to take advantage of our god-given rights to approach them by the blood of Jesus Christ [Music] father we pray that you [Music] will hear the petitions that were spoken and written Lord the ones that were indicated by the lifting up of the of a hand that the people have a a deep need in the in the deepness of their hearts Lord they only [Music] know but we believe that you know those things that are in the deepest part of our hearts and that you promised that you would hear us and that you would you would grant our petitions Lord wherever there would be two or three gathered you said that you would be gathered there in our midst Lord that's what we count on that's what we live for we want to be under the word the banner of the word that's what we want we thank you for the all things that you've done Lord all things that you will do and for the things that you lead us and guide us into father we're led by the spirit of God say of God are led by the spirit of God therefore

Lord of our [Music] shortcomings and we need you Lord God as a group of Elders here in obedience to your [Music] word your children have called forth and activated a part of the scripture that says to call forth the Elders of the church they will lay hands on them they've committed any sin or if they need healing it shall be done Lord you are our healer and you provided a way of healing and that's through the Holy Spirit and that Holy Spirit always goes to the root of the problem it makes no mistake and when it brings forth healing that healing is sure and that is permanent as long as the believer covers itself in the blood of Jesus Christ for there is no other name given unto men that they can be saved by but the name of the Lord Jesus [Music] Christ and in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ every knee every KNE every knee in heaven in Earth and under the Earth shall bow and every tongue shall confess that Jesus Christ is Lord and every Spirit contrary to God's Wordle and in this moment we bring your children before you Lord God you have provided us a checkbook and we've come this moment Lord because you promised you guaranteed us that while we're on this Earth we'd have our right to our birth right of healing and salvation and there's no reason why we have to take a backseat to the devil or his minions nobody we've come to stand upon the word we've come to write out that checkbook and we sign it in the name of Lord Jesus Christ that our little your son here will receive his healing and also for little Scarlet Lord godlet without a shadow of a doubt Lord she needs your touch Lord send that Holy Spirit now and give her a transfusion of healing into her body and when they take that blood sample they will not find anything wrong all they will find is God's provided way of healing today praise you you the thanks for the healing that you provided for your children for those individuals that are in this line Lord they have access and they have a right to receive Your Divine Healing in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ we ask these things amen [Music] amen we have a full house this morning let's give a clap offering for every one of you who are [Applause] [Music]

presence in this place this morning I don't know another place that I'd rather be standing than right here in God's divine presence there's a lot of places that we could be this morning but in his presence with his people around his word is the greatest place I know to be this side of Eternity I greet you all in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ that's the greatest name that's ever been uttered from human lips is the name of the Lord Jesus Christ this morning what brings us together is that the grace of God has expressed itself to each one of us and we may we may come from different walks of life but it is it is in Christ that we're all one and I appreciate the grace of God this morning I want to thank brother John brother we met him down in Mexico City I've heard of brother Garcia for many many years but have never been privileged to meet him I'm glad this morning believe the same gospel I have my son with me this morning Zachariah he is my sixth son I have seven children six boys and then finally we had the girl and we said that's the Omega if you're standing with me this morning while you are I'd like to open to the book of Galatians chapter 3 Galatians chapter 3 we'll read from verses 6 to verse 9 how many say praise the Lord this morning Galatians 3: 6 even as Abraham believed God and it was accounted to him for righteousness know ye therefore that they which are of Faith the same are the children of Abraham and the scripture foreseeing that God would justify the Heathen through faith preached before the gospel unto Abraham saying in thee shall All Nation be blessed so then they which be of Faith are blessed with faithful Abraham let just bow our heads this morning Heavenly Father we come to thee in the name of of our Lord Jesus Christ we thank you for the provided sacrifice that you give us now father we have opened your great word this morning and now we're asking you as the author of it to come and anoint that word to our hearts Lord anoint both the speakers and now this morning Lord the hearers as well may the Holy Spirit take these next few moments and may you speak to every life and every heart we just ask you to help us to get out of the way this morning and your perfect will be accomplished in this service we ask that you'd have preeminence in each heart this morning in the name of Jesus Christ and the church says amen God bless you you may be seated we find this morning as we begin this that Paul the Apostle in the book of Galatians is telling us how that God declared Abraham righteous in his sight Paul is telling us that Abraham our father was declared righteous by faith I want to begin this morning by saying this that when God Almighty declares something righteous means what he says and when he declares us righteous there's no devil in hell that can change God's mind this same writer the Paul the Apostle was speaking to the Roman Church and in the eth chapter he says these words who shall lay anything to the charge of God's elect it is God that justifies now we realize that Paul the Apostle tells us that we are Justified Justified is that we are declared righteous in the presence of God and he said we are declared righteous by faith we are not declared righteous by human works we are declared righteous by faith and the prophet of God taught us that faith is a revelation and he says that Revelation is Sovereign only God can give a man Revelation only God can put Faith in a man's God puts that faith in there to believe his word then God declares that man righteous in his presence there's no man that can take that from you there's no devil that can take that from you God declares us righteous we are righteous by almighty God this under this message of Grace we are not just forgiven we are declared righteous in his presence the prophet of God tells us that's as though we never sin in the first place brother and sister under this message that's been sent by almighty God let me just drop this in here this message we got this morning not the thoughts of William Brandon expressed of almighty God expressed used a man to bring it but this is not the thoughts of a human being this is not the thoughts of a human being but this is the thoughts of Elohim himself and he has declared you righteous you stand in his presence as though you never s in the first place who shall lay anything to the charge of God's elect God that justifies now brother sister the Bible tells us that Abraham if we are believers he has declared to be our father it is important who your father is it is important who you are identified with and Abraham is our father not necessarily because of genetics but because Abraham came from the same source that we came from and in the mind of God before the foundation of the world God fornew every one of us he called us just like he did Abraham he called us by election and Grace I am not here this morning because I deserve this I am not here this morning because I was raised in church I believe in this message this morning because of the grace of almighty God revealed this message to us and by Sovereign Grace he blessed us with the faith to believe this message I want you to think about this we didn't produce the faith God gave us the faith and then God turned around and he blessed us like it's our faith it's really his faith he gave us his faith and then blessed us for heaven that's what I call Grace this morning I didn't deserve it if God would have left me to myself I may be setting in a jail somewhere if God would have left you to yourself you may have been on a street corner somewhere some of you may have been in a Bor room but the grace of God you one day almighty God Sovereign Grace revealed this message to gave you the ability to say Amen to every that's the grace of almighty God now I want you to think for just a minute there are others that want to claim Abraham as well as their father there are three great religions in the world today first of all we have what they call Islam Islam that Abraham is the founder of their faith then we have Judaism and Judaism claims that Abraham is the founder of their faith we have Christianity and we Christians claim Abraham as the founder of our faith list carefully Abraham was not the father of [Music] Israel Abraham was not his father ABR was his father ABR was the father of is but when he got his name changed then Isaac came Abraham is the father of Isaac Abra is the father of Israel when Abra believed God God changed his name to a father of many nations did you know that when God changed Abraham's name and promised him a son and said in these shall all the families of the earth be blessed God had you in mind he us Gentiles in mind Islam goes to is Judaism goes to Isaac Christianity is Abraham's fa seed which is Christ is the Royal seed of abrah and that's why when we are in Christ we are Abraham SE and we according to the promise now what you think about this Islam they pray three times a day they pray to A God Called Allah they they believe that their bodies must be postured to the ground and they must play pray toward Mecca Jud ISM believes that when they pray they must face the temple Islam and Judaism focuses on the posture of a man's body but Christianity does not focus on the posture of our body but focuses on the position of our hearts God doesn't care if you're on your face God doesn't care if you brothers are on a job you can have a paintbrush in your hand you can have a pen at your desk sister can be washing dishes you young people before taking a test if our hearts are right with God our PR it's not where we're at geographically it's where our hearts are before Mighty God our position before almighty God now I want to show you something about position a minute geographically nothing can change your position what a man knows what his position is it's all together different the very man that's writing about Abraham at one time his name was Saul he followed the faith of what Israel had the law but when he met Christ in Acts chapter n and that same Pillar of Fire that brought this message struck him down the road Damascus he met a living Christ that Christ and I am Jesus J and that radically changed Saul's life like Abraham God changed ABR to ABR for Abraham he changed Saul to Paul that same Pillar of Fire come in this day and has changed just from sinner to Saint Church to hallelujah hallelujah it changed our position now I started studying this one day and I found out that Paul never says Apostle Paul it's never Apostle PA it's always PA I started studying it out and I found out if you put Apostle in front of a man name that's only a title but when you put it after a man's name that's a position and what Paul was telling him in the body of Christ is an apostle I am a prisoner of Jesus Christ so you think about this when he was in Rome he was locked up in you cannot find when he was in prison that he ever says I Paul a prisoner of Rome he said but a prisoner of Jesus Christ because he knew that his geographical location change his position now let me say this your geograph location can never change your position but one of these days your position is going to change your G location brother your position is going to step you from one dimension over into another dimension and we're going to be changed there is power this morning knowing who you are as a son and daughter of God every one of you have a position this morning and that position is only found Jesus Christ not in a church not in a building but in Jesus Christ I might as well say it and there's only one way to get into Christ must be born again it ain't be better again it ain't do good again we got to be born again and there's only one way to be born again and that's why the baptism of the Holy Ghost only the Holy Spirit baptize you in Jesus Christ oh my when you get in Christ Jesus you how long you're securing him till the day of your Redemption till God changes your body that's why I said when God puts you in Christ he seals you for all time in eternity justifies you in the Pres of God God don't never change his mind you say praise the [Applause] Lord now I want to I'm watching that clock brother John I'll try to hurry my God a't this message rich is the word of God Wonderful Paul picks up Abraham again in the fourth chapter of Romans and he said what shall we say to Abraham our father and he asked the question as pertaining to the flesh have found he said for If Abraham were justified by works he have wear up to Glory but not before God and what Abraham is telling Paul is telling us no man by human Works can ever declare himself righteous in the presence of feel like I need to say this I taught that boy right there along with all of my other children as long as you live in Daddy's house you can borrow my convictions until you get your own just because he abides by my convictions and he lives in a preacher's home doesn't mean that he ever met Christ we must get these young people to Christ it is not good enough that they just be raised on the church pew we have got to get them to Christ brother bradam says I'm afraid we're getting people to church not to Christ going to church does not make you a Christi CHR but if you ever become a Christian love going to church you can't hardly wait for them Church doors to get open because there's a love of God in your heart now here's what I tell these boys I can take all the dos and the don'ts of this message don't do this do this do this and I can take the very message of Grace and I can turn it into a message of law I can take this great message of Grace and make it a rule book for that young man or I can get him to Christ and when I get him to Christ this message won't be a rule book be a love letter G now words in his heart other words in his heart when Christ gets in there when Christ comes in there and he sees this message and he may hear the prophet say don't do this he doesn't see that as a rule he sees that as a love of God to his life young people this message will keep you from a lot of scars it'll keep you from a lot of regrets and that's wonderful but let me just say this when you experience this message and you get this Christ in your heart wouldn't matter to you what Mama does what Daddy does what your friends do what the neighbor does you're going to serve God anybody does the love of God is in your heart and it's put there by the Holy Ghost can you say praise the Lord now listen he went on to say these words and I just I I just got to get into this now Paul says for what saith the scripture now when Paul is talking about the scripture he is not referring refering to his writings he's not even referring to the writings of any of the Apostles of the New Testament he's talking about the Old Testament the Old Testament is called the scriptures remember First Corinthians 15 the great Resurrection chapter he said Christ died according to the scriptures he was buried according ACC to the scriptures he raised again the third day according to the scriptures scriptures was the Old Testament you remember Jesus's resurrection when he walked with the two mlion Ro the scripture said he took the scriptures he expounded the scriptures beginning with Moses and the prophets all the things concerning himself brother Bram taught us in Christ the mystery God revealed the Old Testament was the complete revelation of Jesus Christ and now we know the new test also the complete Revelation Jesus no matter where you reading this Bible I just say this when God show me this message everything I read is Christ it don't matter where I go if I start with Genesis 1:1 Christ when I go to revelation 22 I see Christ This Book is the entire revelation of Christ brother bam says God slowly unfolded the mystery God gradually let the mystery out so the scriptures is the revelation of Christ God gradually letting it out he's preaching through the entire Old Testament the revelation of Christ to come brother when Jesus come on the scene he had men that stood in front of him and they said Abraham is our father he said if you believe Abraham you'd believe me your father Abraham rejoiced to see my day saw it and was glad you say when did Abraham see Jesus's day now he didn't meet Jesus as a man Jesus hadn't been born yet but he met MDC and form of a man and then later on me became Jesus Christ he met Jesus how he was revealed that day and Abraham didn't pick up stones to ston him Abraham said get me a fatted cal get some milk I want to fellowship with me brother we're doing the same thing right here this morning felling with the Revelation that Jesus Christ revealed in this day he told that crowd he said before Abraham was am then he said I and my father are one stones to Stone him we got Moses if you believe Moses you believe me Moses wrote in me every one of them men was portraying Christ Moses was a prophet of God but he reflected Christ Abel had a revelation but he reflected Christ Isaac was Abraham's beloved Son but he reflected Christ David was up on the mountain but he reflected Christ every one of their prophets for shattering a prophet to come one of those men was a prophet of God but Jesus he wasn't no prophet of God he was the God of all the prophets he was the one they wrote about every one of those men brother B said as eagles they would fly higher than anybody else Mind Of God give the word of God and they would say thus sayth the but when Jesus come read the four gospels he never said thus sayth the Lord he said but I say he was the Lord he met a group in Acts chap excuse me John chapter 10 that said he said for what good work Stone thee they said for good work Stone the we not but for blasphemy because thou being a man Mak thyself God wrong Jesus was not a man making himself God Jesus was God who made himself a man God became a man in the person of Jesus Christ now what you think brother I tell you I've seen this Revelation it's just been burning in me ever since when I see who Jesus Christ is there ain't no man that ever take his place because I love William Bram prophet of God but he'll never take the place of Christ Christ is who we look to didn't point to himself he pointed to Christ this message is not the revelation of William BR it's the Revelation Jesus Christ and it's revealed personally to you that same man boy yall was an easy root to preach to my I'm 46 years old I'm starting to feel like an old man this can you say praise the Lord the scripture said Abraham believed God and it was counted unto him for righteousness his faith alone declared him righteous in the presence of God now listen what God says the Bible says Paul's writing this in the New Testament now and the scripture foreing that God would justify the heathen y'all do know who the bunch of heathens are right that's me and you that's you and I we are them heathens way back there in Abraham God saw your faith in Abraham and God forese that he would justify declare righteous the Heathen by faith Abraham in thee shall all the families of the earth be blessed he was not talking about Abraham just Abraham's natural seed he was talking about his fa think about this the same faith that Abraham had to believe God the exact same thing that causes you to believe God now do you say brother Luke I bet people question me on this but here's what the Bible says how don't believe this Bible is the infallible word of God there ain't no errors in this Bible right here this is our absolute right here hey I got news for folks William Bram William Bram didn't bring us another message he brought us the Revelation this book we're not a bunch of Mormons have another Testament message is the revelation of this book the same Pillar of Fire that wrote the Bible days of Moses and in the days of Paul is now sent to interpret the Bible to us glory and we have today by God's grace the perfect interpretation of the word of God with Divine Vindication believe that say Amen do you realize the faith that Paul was talking about the faith that Abraham had the faith that Paul was pointing back to you and I under the opes of this message has that same Faith because our hearts have been turned back the faith Apostolic fathers right here this morning there's a people in the land that's believing the same message Paul preached can you say praise the Lord Brother bradam would stand there matter of fact he did it in this days the script fulfilled he said Malachi 4 behold I send you aive to the prophet then brother Bram says This Day scripture he saw himself in the word but you know what the rest of that says and he shall turn the hearts of the children back to the faith of the fathers and I today say just like brother Bram this scripture brother Bram was Malachi 4 sitting right in this building this morning is Malachi 46 standing in human flesh this day this scripture is fulfilled our hearts have been turned back to the same faith that Paul the Apostle had Paul the Apostle preached that same faith when brother Brandon went beyond the curtain the time he did not say I preach more than Paul he said I preach the same gospel we preach the same gospel let me just drop this in here you see this rag if it's in this pocket and I take it from this pocket and I switch it to this pocket have I Chang Chang the rag no it's the same rag a different location so if I take the Cornerstone and I make it The Headstone Stone no I've only change the location same Stone it's the same message it's the same Christ it's the same Faith Shing right here it's the same Faith Hallelujah Hallelujah Jesus said even thus shall it be in the day when the son of man is revealed brother Brom says this day this scripture is being fulfilled Willi is not the son of man he is a son of man son of man is Christ William Bram was only a prophet messenger that Christ used to reveal himself in this day but if you'll follow that come down about seven verses and about five or six verses later Jesus said I take one lead one take one lead one take one lead one disciples said where they going lord said where the carcass is Eagles be brother Bram saw Luke 1730 being manifested his own Ministry and said this day this scripture is being fulfilled verse 37 says where of the ccus is where will the Eagles be this day this morning that scripture is being fulfilled right in this building there's a bunch of eagles and we're gathered around the carcass of the word of God this scripture is being fulfilled you say praise the Lord now I want you to watch this how much time I got what time did I start I don't want to wear out my welcome you're going to wear out your interpreter when I got here in the back room this man tried to tell me he wasn't that he was just like a spare tire sort of I don't believe none of that now I've done heard y'all got the best interpreters there heart so I'm not worried about it now I want to show you something just for a couple more minutes love him this morning a't God good to us now the Bible says that Abraham listen close now had the gospel preach to him one day I got to look at I said how in the world did Abraham have the gospel preach I thought the gospel didn't come Jus come but did you know I found where Paul was talking about Israel when they come out of Egypt they got in the wilderness he said For unto us was the Gospel preached as well as unto them so Israel had the gospel preached to and they said that Abraham had the gospel preached to them but then Paul says that the gospel preached to Israel did not profit them because it wasn't mixed with faith the only thing to make the gospel effective to your life is Faith and faith is a revelation and revelation has to be given to you by God so brother my sister if God has give you faith and you believe this morning if you don't have nothing else to thank God for you thank him for the Revelation he put in your heart to believe this glorious gospel now Apostle Paul in Romans chapter 1 he said Paul a servant of Jesus Christ called to be an apostle separated unto the gospel of God listen not the Gospel of Jesus Christ The Gospel of God then he says this statement which he proom promis a four By His prophets in the Holy scriptures so he says the scriptures is the gospel of God that he never come out and preached Jesus his name is not even mentioned but every time God came to them God would require something of them they would beli God even if they didn't fully understand that they're reflecting Christ they were believing the good news that God was preaching in that day you know I I was I was studying I'm probably G have to preach the rest of this tonight if it's all right this is some good stuff but did you know that brother ramam taught us that Cain and Abel were taught by their parents that it was fruit that caused the fall that it was it was fruit there's direct statements that brother B says Cain and abble Tau by their parents that it was fruit that caused the fall so Cain was only bringing to church he was taught by his parents but that morning I can imagine oh Abel was sitting in his office and he was about to go down to AB Tabernacle and he said I was about to make a horrible mistake but about 12:00 he came into the room and he gave me a revelation that it was not fruit but it was blood that caused the fall the church he come that morning to church Cain went to church and taught what his daddy taught him went to church and taught what his daddy taught him what his natural daddy said and Abel was preaching what his Heavenly dadd he had a revelation and when he offered that lamb he was literally portraying the gospel of God that God would redeem us by a lamb a price would be paid now whether he fully understood that there would come a lamb he had a revelation that it was the by the blood of his father in the blood of his mother he was born to sinner but only by the blood of an innocent lamb what his sins be remitted hallelujah hallelujah and brother that message still hadn't changed by the blood of Jesus Christ our sins Glory has been cast in the sea of forgiveness never to be remembered again my faith my Revelation in that blood declares me righteous in the presence of God do you believe that now listen just just about five more minutes I pull a little trick sometimes I said how many give me five minutes how many y'all give me [Laughter] five that's all I need I got eight people gave me five minutes that's 40 he said God promised before by the prophets in the Holy scriptures he said before in the Holy scriptures God promised concerning his son Jesus Christ Our Lord so the scriptures a prophecy concerning his son Jesus Christ Our Lord every type every shadow portrays Jesus Christ that's why brother Ben says if you don't see Jesus Christ and every verse go back and ReRe it the Revelation Jesus let me tell you this the gospel is what we call the good news this this thing concerning Jesus Christ is good news not bad news good news now y'all want to read bad news newspaper turn your television on if you got one or or your monitor listen to the media listen about Hillary and Trump nation's got some bad news going on somebody asked your D said Luke who you voting for I ain't telling y'all nothing I said the only thing I'm going to tell you I sure ain't voting for no woman so you can figure out who I'm voting I'm just [Laughter] kidding hey we got some horrible choices let's just be honest about it that's all bad news all we read about is murder about this crook about this killing about this Riot everywhere we look is bad news I pick up this book I see good news I put a tape of my prophet in I hear good news I open up a spoken word book I hear good news this message is good news this is what we're feeding on Med what's coming out of Washington what come out ofen pilgrims we're just passing through they can have this whole world but there's a land beyond the river there's a future home that's waiting on you and I that's good news I want to be a preacher of good news I want to be a bearer of good news I want to tell the sinner Mercy on the throne I want to tell the sinner your name is in his book I want to tell the prostitute there's still a Christ who saves I want to tell the drunk man there's a God that can sober you up I want to tell a man down there in the prison there a savior that can set you free this is good news the gopel is good news it's good news because it's concerning Jesus Christ now I want tell you this Lord help me let's see I'm on page three and we got 15 pages to go the gospel is not just limited to that this thing is unlimited let me explain you what I mean God's been talking about this ever since the fall as a matter of fact God was the first one that preached it to Adam and Eve it was actually God was the first one that offered a lamb he took the skins of a lamb if I understand marriage and divorce right brother B said God created one and one of everything one buck one dough one rooster one H one and one of everything but when he clothed Adam and Eve he couldn't take one of the a Ram or a lamb that was already there or they'd never be able to reproduce so where did that Ram come from I I'll tell you where it came from if you'll tell me where that Ram came from Abraham got on top of that mountain come the I'll tell you where that lamb come BR if you tell me where Jesus came from it was the creative power of God brother we ain't redeemed with Jewish blood Gentile blood we're redeemed with the blood of Jehovah God himself and there's no sin that can get through that blood don't care where you've been I don't care what You' done if God reveals this gospel person to you if you have faith in that blood that blood will cleanse you from [Applause] all declare you in the presence of God you never send the first place matter if your brother remembers what you did it don't matter if your enemy remembers what you did they can't bring it up on you if God forgot it I don't care who remembers it's cast out of his mind never to be remembered again brother God don't take your sin and put it in his back pocket on you later down the road you confess your sin faithful and just to forgive you your sin do you believe that now listen you say but brother Luke I I did the same thing I did before I got saved I don't want to go tell God about it again God forgives you forgets about it so if you ever come back to him it's like the first time you ever told him he don't remember the last it's already been forgotten about come on Church you might do me wrong or I might do you wrong and you might forgive me but you can still sort of remember that ain't God when he forgives he forgets [Applause] you know what that is that's good news do you know when Jesus was born the Angels said fear not I bring you good tidings Good Tidings listen of great joy brother if anybody has the right to have joy in their heart you say preacher what kind ofy Jo joy unspeakable full of Glory brother we got to right be happy this morning we got a right to Rejoice this morning we got a right to worship the lamb this morning because we've been declared by this gospel righteous in the presence of can you say praise the Lord let me close with this the original sin the original sin necessitated the Virgin birth and the Virgin birth necessitated the new bir what that means is this the original sin was a son born in the world the wrong way virgin birth was a son born the right way the new birth you born the correct way do you know e brought a child in the world the wrong way because she moved away from revelation and just took sensation but Mary moved away from Sensation revation and this bride takes the Revelation that brings some Sensations Glory Hallelujah our new birth corrects everything you may have came the wrong way I may have came the the wrong way but the new birth brings us back the right way Sons and Daughters of Almighty and I really should correct that because the baptism of the Holy Ghost not really make you a Son of God but you Reed the new birth you always was a Son of God glory glor I'm almost done brother do you know the Bible said in Isaiah 9 and6 74 Isaiah 714 says a virgin shall conce Isaiah 96 says unto us a child is born and unto us a son is given a child is born a son is given a child is born is the human a son is given is divine he was both human and he was divine he was a child because he came to the womb of a woman but he was a son given he came from almighty God Mary was the only woman that actually ever received seed birthed a child still a virgin there's not a woman this building that's ever produced a child you're not a virgin it's impossible but married was pregnated produced a child and was still a bir a virgin shall conceive and she actually birthed that child and was still a virgin now listen carefully Lucifer Lucifer in the fall beat Adam to his wife what the prophet said lucier be to his wife got to Eve first and then Eve's womb remained open so when Adam got to her it was one womb with the seeds of two men think about this I'm closing I promise I'm not lying I'm closing I thought I heard somebody say Pharaoh let my people [Laughter] go I'm almost done y'all love him her womb remained open so Lucifer came into God's Eden beat Adam to his wife then Adam got to her and that one womb had two seed but now we're not in God's Eden we're now let me tell you what God did lufer came into in this day God came into Satan got to you and God pregnated you now watch this when God pregnated you this time he closed the womb up so when Lucifer comes he can't get his SE your wom is for one seed your wom is for one seed that's Christ he sealed that room up so it don't matter what the devil says what a false prophet says This Woman This bride Lord this bride in Satan's Eden will not fail she's predestinated not to fall she's ordained of God not to disbel brother there's a bride right here today that Satan can't defeat her to the devil his own grounds the elected bride of Christ we believe his word can you say praise the Lord I want you to think about something if you and your wife was laying in bed together and all of a sudden you heard somebody breaking in the house now if you're a man a real man you would say honey I got this one there's there's some dudes now he ain't a woman but honey let's go check this [Music] [Applause] out let me tell you what Jesus did though he said I defeated him I conquered him I conquered him he's a bluff so in this age Satan comes and God says I'm gonna embarrass him he says honey go take care of him and this wife to the enemy a liar I don't sign for that sickness for that disease already defeated can you say praise the Lord there are some brothers here I know y'all love baseball y'all ain't fooling me I remember y'all probably don't remember me playing with you pitched against y'all guys and I won just Kidd I didn't I like boxing there's a guy by the name of Joe
