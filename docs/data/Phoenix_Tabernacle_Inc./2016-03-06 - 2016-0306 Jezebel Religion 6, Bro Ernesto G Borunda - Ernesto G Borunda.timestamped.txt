[1:03:32] Christ good morning to everybody
[1:03:35] amen while we're standing would you
[1:03:37] please open up your scriptures to I
[1:03:39] believe it's First Kings chapter
[1:03:46] 16 we we'll read just a few few
[1:03:50] verses you may be
[1:03:54] seated
[1:03:58] it reads as follows and a Ahab the the
[1:04:00] son of om I'll be reading from the um
[1:04:04] easy reading King uh King James version
[1:04:07] um so if it's a little different from
[1:04:09] the screen forgive me just if you have
[1:04:12] your Bible just read what the scripture
[1:04:13] says in the Bible ISS um and Ahab the
[1:04:15] son of omy did evil in the sight of the
[1:04:17] Lord above all that were before
[1:04:24] him
[1:04:34] verse 31 and it and it came to pass as
[1:04:36] if it had been a light thing for him to
[1:04:39] walk in the sins of Jobo the son of
[1:04:41] nebat that he took as a wife Jezebel the
[1:04:45] daughter of ithel King of the zidonians
[1:04:48] and went and served
[1:04:51] B and worshiped
[1:04:54] him
[1:05:08] we don't have time to get into the
[1:05:09] details of these scriptures home read
[1:05:12] them
[1:05:16] over it's every word
[1:05:19] is it's a
[1:05:23] mouthful wow and and he reared up again
[1:05:27] it continues and he reared up an altar
[1:05:30] for Baal in the house of Baal which he
[1:05:34] had built in
[1:05:41] Samaria and Ahab made a Grove and I want
[1:05:45] you to focus in that on that word and
[1:05:47] those of us that speak
[1:05:53] English I ain't talking about the
[1:05:56] like the orange girles that brother
[1:05:57] Bernie had over here in the back how
[1:05:58] many how many were here remember those
[1:06:00] this houses back
[1:06:02] here besides brother Bernie house it was
[1:06:04] all nothing but girls
[1:06:05] brother of oranges is that right raise
[1:06:08] your hand if you were
[1:06:14] here in English it sounds like
[1:06:17] that but listen to what it says in in
[1:06:24] Spanish okay and Ahab made a Grove and
[1:06:28] Ahab did more to provoke the Lord God of
[1:06:31] Israel to anger than all the kings of
[1:06:33] Israel that were before
[1:06:46] him in Spanish it says an image to
[1:06:52] as is that right correct
[1:06:56] and it means a sacred
[1:06:59] post when we get into that you're going
[1:07:01] to say oh brother Ernie you're you're
[1:07:06] exaggerating it's right
[1:07:09] here we're GNA see what this world is
[1:07:12] worshiping right
[1:07:14] now um again young
[1:07:17] people I'm putting this in your
[1:07:21] hands I'm going down
[1:07:24] hill
[1:07:28] but my desire My Heart two about two
[1:07:30] years ago I think it was a little over a
[1:07:31] year
[1:07:35] ago you remember me saying
[1:07:38] that that I wanted to get this to the
[1:07:40] young
[1:07:43] people as older ones we've had our
[1:07:45] chance if we don't study the message
[1:07:47] it's our
[1:07:52] fault and if our young
[1:07:54] people
[1:07:55] us and they see I'm talking about me and
[1:08:00] they see that I don't study the
[1:08:02] message they're going to or I'm going a
[1:08:04] role model sort of to
[1:08:07] speak a bad one but but if they see my
[1:08:10] nose in the message
[1:08:14] reading talking about
[1:08:17] it is not what the scripture
[1:08:22] says his heart is in is his his whole
[1:08:26] desire night and day is to meditate on
[1:08:28] the word of God night and
[1:08:32] day his instruction the commission to
[1:08:35] Joshua's you
[1:08:39] know read that it's in judges one I
[1:08:42] think Joshua
[1:08:44] one here I'm commenting and I'm getting

[1:09:09] uh you quietly I I'll read it out
[1:09:13] loud this is what we're focusing on this
[1:09:16] morning is just Jezebel the
[1:09:20] woman way back there about 3,000 years
[1:09:24] ago
[1:09:25] 700 years ago something like
[1:09:29] that the woman a natural woman trying to
[1:09:33] see her what she was in the
[1:09:37] natural once you understand what she was
[1:09:39] in the
[1:09:42] natural then you can see what she
[1:09:48] is yes what she is
[1:09:52] today what do you mean she diad she died
[1:09:55] a long time
[1:09:58] remember this all started with his stops
[1:10:00] to
[1:10:06] Babylons remember that me mentioning
[1:10:10] that and all those gods and goddesses
[1:10:13] you see they started way back there with
[1:10:15] Nimrod and
[1:10:20] samiramis and young people if you
[1:10:22] haven't read it yet read pages 186 to 19
[1:10:25] five roughly of the exposition of seven
[1:10:28] Church
[1:10:34] agents put on your seat belt
[1:10:37] first so and then put a little pillow
[1:10:40] underneath right
[1:10:42] here so when your draw
[1:10:46] drops it won't hit the
[1:10:50] ground it's going to shake
[1:10:52] you I'll just give you one little bit
[1:10:56] Nimrod
[1:10:58] nimr or tamuz or Tam that's in Ezekiel
[1:11:03] 18 all these guys
[1:11:07] Nimrod is there is
[1:11:10] identified and then also semiramis is
[1:11:13] identified there
[1:11:17] also as a
[1:11:20] husband and
[1:11:22] wife or the mother and the
[1:11:27] son brother Paulie how's that
[1:11:30] possible he St tell
[1:11:34] you tells
[1:11:37] you
[1:11:38] him that was at one
[1:11:43] point was both a
[1:11:47] husband and a
[1:11:49] son of the
[1:11:53] woman or you want to say this way the
[1:11:55] the son and then the the son and then
[1:11:57] the
[1:12:00] husband brother brother Ernie what are
[1:12:02] you
[1:12:03] saying I'm not saying I'm just telling
[1:12:05] you to go
[1:12:08] study like brother Alex says a
[1:12:11] lot read the book okay not trying to be
[1:12:14] a smart
[1:12:16] Al I've gone through this also myself I
[1:12:18] learned
[1:12:21] also brother
[1:12:24] said you're a
[1:12:26] historian how many of you have
[1:12:29] studied if you
[1:12:31] studied the seven Church
[1:12:35] ages not for you that's
[1:12:39] good not trying to embarrass
[1:12:41] you but half of you have read the seven
[1:12:43] Church
[1:12:46] ages and you know that it covers a
[1:12:49] period of History
[1:12:52] right so you studied history
[1:12:56] so a
[1:12:57] loose uh definition of that would
[1:13:01] be of that is that you are a
[1:13:04] historian maybe an amateur
[1:13:08] historian you
[1:13:13] know I'm I'm I'm you know a minor minor
[1:13:20] historian okay but I'm still a
[1:13:23] historian brother
[1:13:26] said if you read hisop Two
[1:13:32] Babylons you'll get great light is that
[1:13:35] how he said
[1:13:37] it you it there he's got one right there
[1:13:40] you get great
[1:13:43] light CU all this
[1:13:47] garbage filthy religious
[1:13:52] garbage filthy
[1:13:56] rotten corrupt I don't have enough
[1:14:01] adjectives it all goes starts right off
[1:14:03] over there with
[1:14:06] Babylon and then it got a
[1:14:10] Revival Under The Babylon under
[1:14:15] Nebuchadnezzar his brother B said
[1:14:17] Babylon in the beginning of the
[1:14:21] Bible bon in the middle of the Bible
[1:14:26] and Babylon over here at the end of the
[1:14:29] Bible but it starts up with semi
[1:14:33] Ramis as a woman with
[1:14:36] Nimrod okay you see you understand
[1:14:39] that and then you have a a new uh semi
[1:14:47] Ramis with a new
[1:14:49] name and over there in with
[1:14:53] Nebuchadnezzar then you have a new
[1:15:00] semiramis in in
[1:15:02] Israel and then affecting
[1:15:06] Judah very beautiful
[1:15:09] one but then by the time you get to the
[1:15:11] Book of
[1:15:14] Revelation not doesn't doesn't say
[1:15:18] samis I says one thing I got against
[1:15:21] you is that you suffer that woman
[1:15:27] who calls herself a
[1:15:33] proph you know you see what I'm saying
[1:15:36] so it's very important to understand
[1:15:40] Jezebel and how it affects
[1:15:43] us not talking about any young man in
[1:15:48] particular but just talk to you about
[1:15:50] one just one thing
[1:15:51] about
[1:15:53] um think about the
[1:15:56] Fashions you're always hitting the
[1:15:58] sisters brother
[1:16:01] Ernie well let's talk a little bit about
[1:16:03] the
[1:16:07] guys you got small feet brother
[1:16:11] Ernie average size

[1:16:32] desk

[1:16:39] catch
[1:16:40] thoughts maybe it's my
[1:16:43] thought not being disrespectful I'm just
[1:16:45] trying to show you
[1:16:48] something I'm off way off I'm off topic
[1:16:51] right

[1:21:50] everything young people you got to
[1:21:53] dig doing
[1:21:55] this just a
[1:21:58] surface there's a whole depth in

[1:23:39] preach so you can
[1:23:43] understand so we going talk about

[1:24:19] other words for that but there use a
[1:24:23] harlot this is the
[1:24:26] scripture that shook
[1:24:30] me that I said oh I got to that made me
[1:24:33] turn the
[1:24:35] corner and when we read this of a new
[1:24:41] generation you just say no or
[1:24:45] yes if these

[1:25:49] brother green
[1:25:50] green brother Paul Pablo
[1:25:54] and I can go mention
[1:25:58] more just
[1:26:03] recently so this is a scripture came to
[1:26:06] my that came to that that that woke me
[1:26:09] up a little
[1:26:13] bit second judg judges 2 10 through 13 I
[1:26:18] think it
[1:26:22] is yes I think that's right
[1:26:28] right reads as follows and also that
[1:26:31] generation were gathered to their
[1:26:32] fathers and there arose another
[1:26:34] generation after them which knew not the
[1:26:37] Lord nor yet The Works which he had done
[1:26:39] for
[1:26:53] Israel
[1:26:55] verse 11 and the children of Israel did
[1:26:57] evil in the sight of the Lord and served
[1:27:05] balam and they forsook the Lord God of
[1:27:08] their fathers which brought them out of
[1:27:11] the land of Egypt and followed other
[1:27:12] gods of the people of of of people that
[1:27:15] were around about them and bowed
[1:27:17] themselves to them and provoke the Lord
[1:27:19] to
[1:27:23] anger
[1:27:39] this this one here is just I mean this
[1:27:40] this one here is just
[1:27:41] a you could spend weeks on
[1:27:47] this and they forsook the
[1:27:52] Lord jvh in other
[1:27:55] words the tetraman the four sacred
[1:28:01] letters Elohim Elohim the only
[1:28:04] self-existing
[1:28:06] one who then condescended down into a
[1:28:08] form of a
[1:28:13] light that that light was called the Son
[1:28:15] of
[1:28:17] God but that light that now appeared to
[1:28:19] Moses was called a pillar of
[1:28:23] Fire
[1:28:24] that was not called
[1:28:26] Jehovah that the prophet of God told us
[1:28:29] Jehovah of the Old
[1:28:32] Testament is the Jesus of the
[1:28:35] new so he appeared to Paul as a pillar
[1:28:38] of fire
[1:28:40] again he said why persecute me why are
[1:28:43] you persecuting me
[1:28:48] Paul I'll paraphrase what the
[1:28:50] conversation I'm not persecuting
[1:28:53] you I'm persecuting a bunch of
[1:28:56] Fanatics that they're following this
[1:28:59] this this this
[1:29:02] Jesus I am
[1:29:05] Jesus who are you
[1:29:08] Lord who are you
[1:29:11] J who are you
[1:29:14] Jehovah for the Lord Jesus
[1:29:17] Christ through
[1:29:18] Paul he wrote this Hebrews
[1:29:23] 138 Jesus Christ the same yesterday
[1:29:28] today and
[1:29:29] forever yet we don't understand really
[1:29:32] what that
[1:29:34] [Applause]
[1:29:36] means many of us I didn't understand it
[1:29:41] until our Prophet our
[1:29:42] pastor brought us that Cy read right
[1:29:45] from
[1:29:46] here he said now noce what brother say
[1:29:50] notice what Paul is
[1:29:52] saying that Jesus Christ
[1:29:54] is the same
[1:29:56] yesterday he said that was talking about
[1:29:58] Moses's day your hand heard
[1:30:02] qu many yesterday Moses Pillar of
[1:30:07] Fire Jesus Christ he said the same
[1:30:12] today Paul's saying Paul brother man
[1:30:15] said when Paul is
[1:30:17] writing you understand put it in the
[1:30:20] context of Paul in those
[1:30:21] days got to go back to him
[1:30:24] he is the same in every
[1:30:27] aspect the pillar of fire came down
[1:30:30] here in
[1:30:33] 1906 now I challenge
[1:30:35] you to show me when he went
[1:30:41] back when did he
[1:30:43] live when brother Bram
[1:30:45] died oh
[1:30:48] please brother says he takes his
[1:30:52] man never his spirit
[1:30:56] Pillar of Fire is still here amongst
[1:31:00] us maybe you might be you might have
[1:31:02] been one of the lucky
[1:31:06] ones that was
[1:31:08] baptized if you if you
[1:31:10] were when when I refer to that
[1:31:13] baptism then raise your hand so these
[1:31:16] people won't think I'm a crazy
[1:31:18] man people tell me why you need this
[1:31:22] verification I need a verif
[1:31:24] ification the word tells me to get
[1:31:29] verification it says at the M of two or
[1:31:32] three Witnesses let every word be
[1:31:37] established so if I'm just talking here
[1:31:39] by
[1:31:40] myself I'm a babbling
[1:31:44] fool what else was new brother
[1:31:47] ER well if I have confirmation then I I
[1:31:50] you may consider me still a fool but
[1:31:52] what I just finished saying was true
[1:31:59] and you have think then it's your
[1:32:00] attitude as to what was
[1:32:05] said Remember the little cat that was
[1:32:08] cold or wet or whatever and the little
[1:32:10] girl wanted to warm it
[1:32:18] up she had good intentions
[1:32:21] right but what did she do to to to warm
[1:32:24] it
[1:32:27] up she threw it in the
[1:32:29] oven say yes if you know that's to be
[1:32:33] true amen now I'm just saying say yes if
[1:32:36] you know that to be
[1:32:39] true said her her intention was
[1:32:43] good but her discernment was
[1:32:48] faulty
[1:32:50] yeah so be careful about what you to
[1:32:54] judge what is
[1:32:58] said what is said when a voice when a
[1:33:02] word goes out if it's said
[1:33:05] correctly and I'm trying to be trying to
[1:33:10] check to really really keep in
[1:33:15] check to really
[1:33:20] restrain to
[1:33:22] Shackle
[1:33:24] the Ernie berunda
[1:33:26] eroa and I like that Ernie berunda that
[1:33:29] when he received his
[1:33:34] experience speak for him to
[1:33:36] speak because I was like this the real
[1:33:38] learninga was me Ernie was like the
[1:33:41] conscious Ernie was like
[1:33:44] this but I could see my hands
[1:33:48] moving
[1:33:51] speaking I knew what I was going to say
[1:33:53] I said wow am I going to say
[1:33:56] that remember that day sister
[1:33:59] Joan
[1:34:01] sort I barely remember now to my shame
[1:34:04] do January 21st
[1:34:09] 1981 but if you're lucky enough to be
[1:34:12] here in this Baptist
[1:34:16] tree when brother Bernie was
[1:34:21] baptizing he baptized somebody
[1:34:24] if you if you were remember seeing
[1:34:27] that raise your hands so other people
[1:34:29] know that I'm not I'm not speaking like
[1:34:31] a
[1:34:38] fool I'm not beating the air as a fool
[1:34:41] okay how many remember when brother
[1:34:43] Bernie was baptizing
[1:34:46] people as soon as he baptized
[1:34:50] them they come going
[1:34:52] Hallelujah
[1:34:55] how raise your hand if you
[1:34:57] remember you remember that's great you
[1:35:00] may not remember what he
[1:35:02] said but I'll if I'm wrong you correct
[1:35:05] me but I think this is what he said kind
[1:35:06] of sort
[1:35:10] of he said you know why these people are
[1:35:12] coming up like that jumping and yelling
[1:35:14] and
[1:35:18] screaming and if you remember him saying
[1:35:21] this I'm going to say next
[1:35:25] hand he says as soon as he says as soon
[1:35:29] as they are baptizing they come up
[1:35:30] yelling and
[1:35:33] screaming he says you know why he says
[1:35:37] because the pillar of fire right there
[1:35:41] right
[1:35:42] now raise your hand if you remember hear
[1:35:44] him
[1:35:46] saying Sister Sister J please nice and
[1:35:51] high that's it
[1:35:54] that's what
[1:35:56] happened that was 1980 Something
[1:36:02] 90 Pillar of Fire has been with
[1:36:06] us oh just a finished
[1:36:09] Tabernacle no
[1:36:12] no but he's searching out a
[1:36:17] BRI but this this next last scripture is
[1:36:22] shaking
[1:36:24] and they forsook the
[1:36:27] Lord and sered
[1:36:30] ba what is Ba
[1:36:32] mean Lord so they forsook the Lord and
[1:36:36] they served
[1:36:39] Lord come brother are you playing Words
[1:36:41] with
[1:36:42] us no no God God has it
[1:36:46] here L that also means
[1:36:49] husband ba also means
[1:36:52] husband so when you you
[1:36:54] sing you're not going to mention the
[1:36:56] name of the Lord
[1:36:58] Jesus at least song leaders Brothers
[1:37:00] song leaders at least say we sing this
[1:37:02] going to sing this song to the honor and
[1:37:03] glory of the Lord Jesus
[1:37:10] Christ because you just say Lord Lord
[1:37:15] Lord good to me you might as well be
[1:37:17] saying ba B you've been so good to
[1:37:21] me I'm not being funny because you can
[1:37:24] see here in the
[1:37:26] scripture in in the in
[1:37:29] Kings Chronicles and
[1:37:32] Kings some of the men would name their
[1:37:36] children I got a scholar right here they
[1:37:38] would name their son
[1:37:41] B if you know that to be true raise your
[1:37:45] hand yes it ba such a common
[1:37:52] word
[1:37:55] ba and
[1:38:01] ASO same word same person same woman
[1:38:04] different pronunciation in two different
[1:38:09] cultures
[1:38:11] both
[1:38:13] Gods a
[1:38:16] god ba was a
[1:38:19] God orar was a god
[1:38:22] goddess
[1:38:24] God of
[1:38:25] fertility and a goddess of
[1:38:30] fertility and when we get into what they
[1:38:31] would
[1:38:33] do and why they would backslide or
[1:38:37] apostas right away become go into
[1:38:39] apostasy right
[1:38:41] away you'll see why
[1:38:45] readily one King's way up here now the
[1:38:48] guy worshiping
[1:38:52] ASO
[1:38:54] you'll see why
[1:38:59] okay brother bam tells us about uh
[1:39:02] United
[1:39:04] States had a great man like Washington
[1:39:06] and
[1:39:08] Lincoln then we had an
[1:39:11] Ahab and she set the Fashions of the
[1:39:14] world she said he said we did the same
[1:39:17] things in take have taken place
[1:39:20] here this is still just bar reviewing
[1:39:22] right now jel was a
[1:39:25] she taught to she was taught to hate
[1:39:28] Jehovah to hate God's
[1:39:31] people that hatred in her
[1:39:34] heart what she
[1:39:37] was in the absolute brother bam tells us
[1:39:40] whole nation hated him talking about
[1:39:46] Elijah he says
[1:39:49] Jezebel and all the rest of
[1:39:52] them yeah
[1:39:54] they hated him very
[1:39:59] much yeah they they didn't like what he
[1:40:02] preached and what he
[1:40:05] did so the next is uh brother man tells
[1:40:08] us about
[1:40:10] attitudes so we take the same
[1:40:14] attitudes we're g to get the same
[1:40:15] rewards that they
[1:40:18] got same reward everything and the same
[1:40:22] blessings or the same
[1:40:24] penalties brother ER still talking so
[1:40:29] negatively follow me I was telling
[1:40:32] brother Junior back
[1:40:33] there said that I hope people don't miss
[1:40:39] it that the same time I'm talking about
[1:40:41] Jezebel doing this
[1:40:44] here all that junk she's doing in
[1:40:48] Israel that there's still another group
[1:40:50] up
[1:40:51] here like one of the those men are while
[1:40:54] she's trying to kill the
[1:40:56] prophets there's one brother that's out
[1:40:58] there trying to hide him and protect
[1:41:02] them but a
[1:41:05] minority I when she brought her
[1:41:08] Revelation she brought her Revival to
[1:41:12] Israel sisters you can dress down to
[1:41:15] here here you can wear down to
[1:41:19] here brother said I saw this one woman
[1:41:22] one day
[1:41:25] she had
[1:41:27] earrings ring the
[1:41:29] AR she had some so
[1:41:33] big it it looked like
[1:41:36] Satan just sat on her
[1:41:38] shoulder us her rings like
[1:41:45] stups and just you know writing her like
[1:41:48] a
[1:41:50] yeah that's what he said mad me that's
[1:41:53] what your your Prophet said my Prophet
[1:41:56] said
[1:41:59] that and he said say what the tape
[1:42:03] say say what the vision
[1:42:06] say
[1:42:09] continue okay this is how we the our
[1:42:11] progress of our
[1:42:13] study we we saw how Israel parallels and
[1:42:16] United States and Israel parallel each
[1:42:20] other and we see we saw her as a
[1:42:26] girl she introduced the
[1:42:29] Fashions with with her uh dress and her
[1:42:32] shoes and so
[1:42:33] forth and then now we're talk going to
[1:42:35] talk about and then we talked about the
[1:42:37] Fashions with the dress now we're
[1:42:39] talking about Jezebel the
[1:42:41] woman to me it's gonna get good and
[1:42:44] good because we're going to get into her
[1:42:47] religion and you're not going to want to

[1:58:16] America she was being
[1:58:19] led and we're going to break that down
[1:58:21] exactly you're not going to like it
[1:58:23] you're not going to like it cuz you
[1:58:24] shouldn't be saying that or brother Bram
[1:58:26] said
[1:58:28] it pastor
[1:58:34] already well leave it to
[1:58:39] him to him brother brother
[1:58:44] Bernie I'm not going to say what I was
[1:58:46] going to say but I will say this much I
[1:58:47] did talk to him about speaking about
[1:58:51] this
[1:58:54] and he said this so the people need to
[1:58:56] hear it
[1:58:58] Ernie oh going to say well yeah on the
[1:59:01] tape he was talking to me when I said I
[1:59:03] was going to say
[1:59:06] it try to I'm not trying to justify
[1:59:08] myself wrong you're
[1:59:13] wrong because brother BR say many
[1:59:17] places say if you don't have a closed
[1:59:19] line religion You Don't Preach a Clos
[1:59:21] line
[1:59:25] you much of a preacher
[1:59:27] said
[1:59:28] know brother so you can
[1:59:34] see if you're
[1:59:44] preacher If You Don't Preach a Clos line
[1:59:49] religion I doubt that you even have a
[1:59:51] Ministry goes for the man and the
[1:59:54] women okay men should dress a certain
[1:59:57] way women should women should dress a
[1:59:59] certain
[2:00:03] way but the Holy Ghost should you know
[2:00:05] should tell should lead us to all truth
[2:00:07] and righteousness
[2:00:10] brother those two Spirits are so close
[2:00:12] to each
[2:00:15] other when you preach against
[2:00:18] Jezebel you don't like it you're wrong
[2:00:23] I was trying to like I said earlier I
[2:00:24] didn't say finish I
[2:00:26] start I'm trying to get away from that
[2:00:29] trying to keep that spirit that F the
[2:00:31] fercal and legalistic
[2:00:37] spirit so what brother so you can see
[2:00:39] what brother Brown
[2:00:41] said but the older
[2:00:44] folks we're we're pretty much set in our
[2:00:48] ways young people are more malleable
[2:00:50] more uh uh uh able to accept the things
[2:00:53] the prophet said with a nobler
[2:01:01] heart brother Bram when he was talking
[2:01:03] to to Bram
[2:01:06] Tabernacle in the Hebrews
[2:01:08] book in the messages there he said many
[2:01:13] of you are
[2:01:15] legalistic no over 90% of you
[2:01:19] are he says no that's okay
[2:01:23] because he also said to one
[2:01:26] lady sister I didn't see you send you at
[2:01:32] church well I was I was doing my
[2:01:37] laundry you know I'm not legalistic
[2:01:40] about
[2:01:42] that he said well you better be about
[2:01:48] Sunday so if I say that about working on
[2:01:50] Sunday
[2:01:53] and I just say what brother B
[2:01:55] said some of you are not going to like
[2:01:59] it because he said you shouldn't work on
[2:02:07] Sunday see
[2:02:10] I I'm already preaching
[2:02:12] it sorry I don't know who said that over
[2:02:14] there I'm not trying to embarrass you
[2:02:19] brother that CU it cuts me deeply right
[2:02:25] but you know they told Brother yeah but
[2:02:26] you know the the scripture says that you
[2:02:28] know if your Ox falls into the
[2:02:33] D that that that you can in the Sabbath
[2:02:36] you can pull them
[2:02:38] out and brother
[2:02:40] Bram using
[2:02:42] humor so he won't cut
[2:02:46] him use a little
[2:02:48] humor he says yes brother but don't push
[2:02:52] him
[2:02:55] in you you go up to the to the
[2:02:59] list for
[2:03:03] scheduling man I I got to work Sunday
[2:03:05] because I gotta make some I got to make
[2:03:06] some
[2:03:16] coins not talking about anybody
[2:03:20] specifically anybody could have won
[2:03:22] millions of dollars a
[2:03:27] lawsuit it would have been brother
[2:03:29] Johnny
[2:03:30] Al when he worked for standard
[2:03:34] Brands standard Brands and he and he was
[2:03:37] fighting to get Sundays off to go to
[2:03:42] church he didn't want to
[2:03:44] work I think it was 18 years
[2:03:47] old almost 50 years
[2:03:49] ago more or less 50 years ago
[2:03:53] uh no it wasn't that long uh he was 23 I
[2:03:56] think so anyway he was long time
[2:03:59] ago yeah and the day that they were
[2:04:03] going to fire
[2:04:05] him uh his boss was fired because he was
[2:04:09] stealing money from the
[2:04:15] company the that's brother Johnny's boss
[2:04:17] that is soole the
[2:04:20] money
[2:04:22] and uh so I apologize to you for for not
[2:04:25] getting very far I think
[2:04:26] it's I'm way past time
[2:04:31] now would you please
[2:04:33] stand uh we notice what we want to do is
[2:04:35] just follow natural the natural
[2:04:41] jbel and then we see that her natural
[2:04:43] traits are type of spiritual
[2:04:50] trait
[2:04:52] and this is what brother Ram said
[2:04:54] everything that's everything that's
[2:04:56] called that's
[2:04:59] mean is called
[2:05:04] Jezebel it's a
[2:05:06] system it's it's it's it's it's so um
[2:05:10] pervasive it's so everywhere it's
[2:05:14] like this is of this is a sense of
[2:05:18] humor it's so
[2:05:20] ubiquitous and brother
[2:05:23] Alex it's so
[2:05:25] everywhere we can't even discern
[2:05:29] it but when you can sense
[2:05:33] it when
[2:05:34] she's
[2:05:37] attacked on the
[2:05:38] platform and you feel a little
[2:05:42] uncomfortable or angry or
[2:05:44] upset and it's those spirits that try to
[2:05:47] anoint
[2:05:49] us they don't like it
[2:05:52] because we're talking about her
[2:05:54] mother and they don't like it in the
[2:05:57] spiritual just like you don't like it if
[2:05:59] you're if I talk about your mom right
[2:06:03] now something you jump up here and
[2:06:08] you so it's same thing in the
[2:06:12] spiritual but the only way she can
[2:06:13] affect
[2:06:15] you you yield yourself to
[2:06:17] her
[2:06:20] spirit you understand little bit okay so
[2:06:24] we're going to get into that uh later on
[2:06:25] and then
[2:06:27] uh let's us pray and thank the
[2:06:30] Lord and uh it I'd love to sing that
[2:06:34] song um that we were singing when I came
[2:06:37] up here uh open my eyes Lord we sing
[2:06:40] that song and then our brother that's
[2:06:42] going to be uh singing uh taking over
[2:06:44] will come up front
[2:06:47] please Heavenly Father we thank you Lord
[2:06:50] for your word this morning
[2:06:54] you know that my 100% intention was to
[2:06:57] just read Lord as a Sunday school
[2:07:04] lesson perhaps next time
[2:07:07] lord uh we can get into the
[2:07:10] [Music]
[2:07:12] lesson forgive me if I did wrong
[2:07:16] [Music]
[2:07:18] Lord I don't apologize for what I said
[2:07:21] Lord because I I believe I was trying to
[2:07:22] say what your word
[2:07:27] says maybe I should have stayed more to
[2:07:29] reading Lord forgive me forgive
[2:07:34] me but there's so much to be
[2:07:39] said that I I get a little anxious Lord
[2:07:44] know wanting the people the young people
[2:07:46] Lord to understand and just go off and
[2:07:50] study this Lord
[2:07:54] but I know many of them have not even
[2:07:55] taken that first step
[2:08:00] and that's to hear or read Jezebel
[2:08:06] religion they'll see why brother Branham
[2:08:08] even a year later after he preaches it
[2:08:10] almost to the day almost to the
[2:08:16] day he says read or hear je about
[2:08:20] religion
[2:08:24] what an awesome
[2:08:26] message and then he
[2:08:28] says may in that message of Jezebel
[2:08:32] religion you know Lord he said may you
[2:08:34] never forget this
[2:08:40] afternoon so let we we thank you
