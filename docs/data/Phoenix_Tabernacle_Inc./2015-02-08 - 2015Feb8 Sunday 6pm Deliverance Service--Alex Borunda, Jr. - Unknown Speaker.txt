Soul so is good news from a far country Lord Jesus we thank you this evening as we can talk to the people a little bit Lord we Are Witnesses of things that happen we Are Witnesses and and we we we love you Lord Jesus you have witnessed Our Lives you changed our lives and you're still working on us Lord bless bless your people this evening we ask you all these things in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ isn't that beautiful scripture as cold Waters to a thirsty soul I don't know about you but if you've ever worked out as a laborer or in construction here in Phoenix Arizona dur in the summer time you there's nothing so refreshing so quch that quenches your thirst like cold water not a cold soda pop not hot coffee but cold water there's nothing like it but if you have never worked in construction not you're not perspiring and you you don't know what I'm talking about that's the way it is you don't know what I'm talking about thank you as cold Waters to a thirsty soul in Proverbs 25 if you're thirsting tonight which you're I'm sure you're thirsting tonight you didn't come here to hear me you didn't come here to F to fill the pews you didn't come here because you wanted a uh you didn't have a good television program to watch you didn't come here just because you wanted to be here but if you could only realize that God for ordained for you to be here not because I'm here but because he knows all about you and he's for ordained all things for those that love him now if you're a thirsty Soul you're going to receive cold water you're not going to receive hot water you're going to receive refreshing cold water you're going to receive good news now the good news is the Gospel of Jesus Christ and the good news is Malachi 4 Mal 4 re that is the good news to the generation where would you be and where would I be tonight if it hadn't been for God's for ordination giving us a prophet to give us a message come out of her my people most of us had come out most of us have come out what we've done we've come out we sat down and now we're sitting down in a rocking chair we're sitting in prison like brother Alex was for 12 years want to go place let the missionaries do it go over here let them go there I've got a good job man well that's not a good job but it's a good job I'm getting into problems right okay let me put it to you this way it was a good job because I worked at a high school as a high school teacher and I said second week I said I am out of here there's no way I'm going to go to prison no I'm going to go to prison get out and guess we're ended up I ended up in prison because the the college taught me and they wanted me in there so anyway that's another wow if you're thirsting tonight I am a cold drink of water I am a cool drink drink of water Revelation says there was the waters peoples we are Waters you and I are Waters we are an influence to people people can drink from us they can drink bitter Waters or they can drink cool refreshing what do you want to drink tonight it's good news from a country from a far country we ended up in Vietnam brother phelipe robes myself and brother Montoya I had been invited several times to go and the same old thing what business do I have over there and I the Lord rebuked me started talking to me and I realized that I have not have not done nothing absolutely nothing for I'm not talking about yesterday I'm talking about today Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today and forever that true now let me tell you another thing you don't have to believe me but it's Bible I'm not going to prove it to you but it's Bible is there a devil yes see okay is there a god who's more powerful amen amen yes see but let me tell you it's not enough to believe this over here this Bible it is not enough to sit in your rocking chair and say I believe 4 you're thank you Jesus I Am So Satisfied I Am So Satisfied because I believe this message no that's not enough the devil believes himself and let me tell you the devil believes us so much I don't know if they believe me okay the devil believes this word so much that he is working 247 he don't stop that's right and he accuses the Brethren that's his job what are we going to do about it we need to get into action you need to be liberated this is a Deliverance service I am delivering unto you Freedom I'm delivering to you the good news I'm delivering to you the key so you can turn the key I am not a reformer I refuse to be a reformer did you hear what I right before I went to Vietnam something happened and I said you know I ain't going to reform nobody I'm tired of this you know what Reformation is reform is easy when you when you have an abuse on some program or something you remove the abuse take the abuse out and you Institute an improvement and now you have have a Reformation but God did not call us to be a reformer God called us to lay it on the line it tell it and and let it fall where it's going to fall it's God doing the work if you were here this morning God did the work told Abraham I'm going to bless you you ain't got nothing to do about it I'm going to bless you I'm going to curse those that curse you I said enough it's good news from AC far country I come telling you that brother Dr Montoya Ernest Montoya he is God's man of faith and power I'm going to tell you that God's still working he's working out there in the jungles of Vietnam there are people receiving the message of the hour they need need gospel preachers but they need the apostolic setting in order of the preaching okay I'm giving you some some information right now okay we went there we had four services in those weeks that were there people were delivered were healed and and so forth and so on I saw this young lady she came forward and I saw the presence of the Lord coming down and as brother Montoya was talking to her the spirit of the Lord was talking to me it was the same thing that we were connected it was the same Spirit directing us and that young lady she came and she was asking she was asking for her for for her family but I looked at her I put my eyes on her she needed the help she needed a transformation but her approach to God's servants there at that time she was willing to take but for her family what a Divine approach to God we were waiting to see ex Miracles there we went to another service the spirit of knowledge came over we started talking to the people there brother Montoya ministered and people were receiving the gospel the only thing that we need there in Vietnam is a person that can speak English well enough to understand what we are saying they are translating the books there in in in dang Vietnam in Vietnam there are three sisters there there are translating the books from the English to Vietnamese and if you would see their work it just hurts you it it really it really hurts you but you believe I believe that God is going to reward them God is going to reward you for your efforts God is going to reward you for being faithful to this church did you hear what I just said that it's what brother Bram taught us be faithful to your pastor be faithful to your pastor be faithful to your church be have an allegiance there pay your tithing pay your offerings church beay at your post of Duty think right do right it's what things that we must do as cold Waters to a thirsty Soul so is good news from a far country I don't know what happened to time how much I don't know I have idea I lost it I'm sorry I did not check sorry we were in the air there we flew from Phoenix to San Francisco Phoenix of San Francisco San Francisco to Hong Kong San Francisco Hong Kong Hong Hong Kong to Vietnam the Hong Kong of Vietnam to Saigon Vietnam which was Saigon at one time now it's hin City then from there later on couple days later we flew to dang where the war was on where it was hot and heavy we were there and if you ever saw brother if if you ever know brother Montoya I wish you would have seen his face and brother pH when they were sing there at those places where 58,000 us Americans lost their lives but where there was hand-to-hand combat where there where there was things were hot and heavy I wish she would have been in there not only that but the Viet Kong one of the guys that was in the wars he took us there and and he told us what was going on brother talked to them he said many lives were lost For What on your side many people died our side many people died for what what an impression it left on the people there you have to know that Vietnam is a communist country you cannot just walk under there and have a service you can't do that the mother Harlot she's got a big old church there do anything she wants to but the Christians no no we ended up in the jungles and I'll start finishing with this we ended up in the jungles where we had to get off and walk and and I have to be sincere with you okay one of the young

brotherto brother Philipe they no ride they on the way back same thing thing it was good so but you know I I I I can run with them forget about that okay brother Alex gets in the way that's not that's that's no good but God is good and I saw the power of God there I saw the power of God that people were healed people were called out you Minister a person there in private and he was delivered also
