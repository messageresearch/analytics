[19:08] the one that
[19:13] [Music]
[19:21] of the year scripturally
[19:51] born at home
[19:59] let's look at verse 12
[20:03] [Music]
[20:11] i will pass through the land of egypt
[20:12] this night and will smite all the
[20:13] firstborn in the land of egypt both men

[21:28] in the message order in doctrine
[21:32] page 483
[21:34] the prophet says
[21:39] what is a birthright
[21:56] this holy spirit is your birthright in
[21:59] terms of
[22:01] that so if i understand
[22:05] if i'm wrong
[22:08] but if i understand correctly the word
[22:23] he says the holy spirit is your
[22:25] birthright
[22:27] in other words when you're born
[22:31] then you have all right
[22:35] and that right is to have the holy ghost
[23:37] the holy ghost should be the most
[23:39] important thing to you
[23:42] then everything else there is in the
[23:44] world
[23:46] more than your prestige
[23:48] your
[24:16] not
[24:30] [Music]
[24:58] deuteronomy 6
[25:01] verse 4
[25:09] o israel the lord our god is one lord
[25:44] speak unto aaron and to his sons and
[25:46] unto all the children and say unto them
[25:49] whatsoever he be of the house of israel
[25:51] or of the strangers in israel that will
[25:53] offer his oblation for all his vows or
[25:56] for all his free will offerings which
[25:58] they will offer unto the lord for a
[25:59] burnt offering
[26:08] of
[26:10] you shall offer at your own will a male
[26:13] without blemish of the beasts of the
[26:14] sheep or of the goats
[26:18] is it going to be voluntarily or by
[26:20] force
[26:24] now let's look at first corinthians once
[26:26] again
[26:27] this is faith chapter 16
[26:31] and verse 2.
[26:34] from the first day of the week
[27:28] [Music]
[27:35] on the first day of the week when the
[27:36] disciples came together to break bread
[27:38] paul preached unto them ready to depart
[27:40] on the morrow and continued his speech
[27:42] until midnight
[27:46] so disciples even gathered together on
[27:48] the first day of the week
[27:50] who got together
[27:52] the disciples
[27:54] a disciple is one that followed us
[27:57] and who is our master
[28:43] blemish that shall ye not work
[28:47] for it shall not be acceptable for you
[28:51] see whatever had a spot on it could not
[28:53] be brought
[28:54] [Music]
[29:00] and whosoever offers the sacrifice of
[29:02] peace offerings unto the lord to
[29:03] accomplish his vow
[29:05] voluntarily
[29:13] for a free will offering in thieves or
[29:15] sheep it shall be perfect to be accepted
[29:18] there shall be no blemish therein
[29:22] blind or broken
[29:27] [Music]
[29:53] superfluous or lacking his parts that
[29:56] that that may establish for a free will
[29:58] offering but for a bow it shall not be
[30:00] accepted
[30:08] you shall not offer unto the lord that
[30:10] which is bruised or crushed or broken or
[30:12] cut neither shall you make any offering
[30:14] thereof in your land
[30:22] neither from a stranger's hand shall you
[30:24] offer the bread of your god of any of
[30:26] these things
[30:34] they shall not be accepted for there is
[30:36] corruption there is corruption in them
[30:41] any animal that had a blemish
[30:42] [Music]
[30:44] blind or maimed
[30:47] anything similar no
[31:15] and when the sabbath was passed mary
[31:16] magdalene and mary the mother of james
[31:18] and salome
[31:19] had bought sweet spices and they might
[31:21] come and anoint him
[31:30] yeah and very early in the morning at
[31:34] the first day of the week they came upon
[31:36] the sepulcher at the rising of the sun
[31:39] when did they come in
[31:41] what day of the week was
[31:44] what is the first day of the week
[31:46] domingo

[31:53] morning
[31:55] cleaning the cobwebs from their eyes
[31:58] is that right
[33:20] the blood of the lord
[35:55] that's the first fruit of yours
[36:00] he comes before everything else
[36:04] and it has to come out from here
[36:07] the deepest part of your heart
[36:09] how much is it
[36:25] bro
[36:27] but then i do make a sacrifice
[36:30] and i go on and buy a car
[36:33] give two hundred dollars a month of a
[36:34] car payment
[36:36] i get my check
[36:38] the

[37:40] and the first beginning of the week
[37:42] you give to god first
[37:44] the first horror the best in tongues
[38:02] how many of you believe that jesus
[38:03] christ is the same yesterday today and
[38:05] forever
[38:07] i believe that also
[38:11] how many of you believe that jesus lives
[38:14] there are you sure

[39:42] but the reason that we keep sunday is a
[39:44] memorial of the resurrection
[39:53] you should say the reason why we keep
[39:54] sunday is because it's a memorial of the
[39:56] resurrection
[40:03] the roman catholic did that
[40:06] they claimed that they did that
[40:24] for they met on the first day of the
[40:25] week for their worship
[40:28] when did they get together
[40:30] amen is that right
[40:32] did they get together
[40:34] who gathered
[40:36] the disciples
[40:50] is that right
[41:02] [Music]

[41:07] christian jew judeo orthodox and an
[41:09] orthodox jew

[41:16] but one went on saturday
[43:22] because they don't believe that jesus
[43:24] christ

[44:13] the brother and i were talking and uh he
[44:15] didn't
