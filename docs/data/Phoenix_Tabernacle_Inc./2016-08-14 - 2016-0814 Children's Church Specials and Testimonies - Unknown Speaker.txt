New Mexico but I gave this testimony about you know just kind of what God's been doing in my life and I thought I'd share it with you guys before I sing and excuse me cuz I get a little nervous um um so this is pretty much about um my you know school and my career path and all of that and you know I um said it in Albuquerque because there were youth services and I was hoping maybe it could help somebody who was possibly going through something similar so um when I first graduated high school I was 17 I graduated early graduated a year early and um I had been you know with the person who was convincing me to you know do other things things that I wasn't even sure that I wanted to do so you know I was following career paths and going to school for something I didn't want to go to school for and I was in this relationship that was really harmful and um you know I'm just thankful that there were never like any doors of opportunity that opened when I was in that relationship when I was going through those career path because um now that I'm you know I've prayed a lot about it and now that I'm going you know for a veterinarian and all that you know God has just opened up doors like it's crazy how like if you just pray and you wait on God to give you the answer for whatever it is you're looking for even if you don't know what it is you're praying about you'll know when God gives you the answer he'll just open up doors for you and you know so just wait on him never stop praying and he's always there for you so just hoping that you know that helps somebody who's questioning you know college if they don't think it's for them if you know just pray and wait on God and if it's for you he'll open up doors and if it's not then he has something better in store for you so so I sang this song A couple Fridays ago um and I just hope you guys are blessed by it can you guys hear the guitar yeah [Music] [Music] inh [Applause] are you the man said are you the man said [Music] in

in my husband 's life he's blessed us with a a little baby boy coming into our lives soon um and I think the Lord for that but it wasn't always um a smooth ride and um at the very beginning when I we found out we were expecting um it was I was 6 weeks and I went to the doctors and the doctor was doing the ultrasound and said sorry um I start over oh okay um and said that you know she couldn't see she I was pregnant but she couldn't see a baby um that it was way too small and from the looks of it um she said I have to be honest with you you know she's like I want to see you in 2 weeks because there's a big possibility you're going to lose this baby and you know when you find out you're pregnant that's the last thing you want to hear you know um sorry and um I I left that appointment really disappointed upset mad because I was like I thought this was supposed to be a blessing in your life you know and um but she said you know this Within These two weeks you're basically going to find out if you're going to keep it or not and so those two weeks that were the hardest weeks of my life and um you know I had to really just be alone and I had to realize you know I could take this two ways I could either you know say God why why are you doing this to me you know this is not right or I can say I'm going to trust you you know and I decided to go that route because you know he's The Giver of Life and I I trust him with my life and and that's what I did you know those two weeks I put brother brandom and I was like you know what like I'm going to have this baby boy and and I'm just thankful that God gave me the strength to give us me and my husband the strength for those two weeks you know and we went back and our baby boy was a normal size and uh I just thank god um thank you bless

enter least we come like children so then how many we want to be childrens of him I want to invite you the last two weeks I rejoiced yes yes may be seated for the last two weeks we've been TR traveling first we were with in Albuquerque with brother miguelos there were youth services and and truly God is doing a great work in New Mexico and it takes me back to when we had the first service in Albuquerque in Albuquerque Sheron in the Sheron Hotel when our pastor directed us to have a service there to so to see how our pastor's Vision albquerque has come to bless the people in albuquer it's really good because we know he's and we weren't a lot Brothers I believe there's more people here today than there were in the services in Al but the ones that were there the one who was there was the Lord and the Lord says and the Lord says English I'm going to say it in English all those who the father has given me will come to me right amen and so so not even one will be lost not even one I want to talk to the children for a second Albuquerque so but um from those that actually went to Albuquerque is there anyone that would like to share a small little testimony of what the Lord did while you think about that I want to tell the children something Albuquerque when we were in Albuquerque the Lord brought the young people a message that was titled influenceu influence is a really important thing for you and it's and it's very simple there's good influence the word of God and there's bad influence let's go to our scripture quickly it's going to be in first Corinthians be not deceived evil Communications corrupt good manners amen so in another version of the Bible it says be not deceived evil company corrupts good morals amen what I want to tell the children see if anybody is willing to testify of the goodness of the or anyone that went to on last week I want to tell you what the word of God is saying here that if we come together with Bad Company it's going to corrupt our good teachings morals which our parents our pastor has taught us come here either one come here it's so simple influence here's a little young man El Bernie can you come down here for a second yes sir El influ he's going to have good influence or Mala influen or bad influence you know you should really read your Bible uh you know at least once every day nah swack let's go play Pokemon it's that simple brother jaier told the young people so Bernie can do it in English he told the young people Al that if he started with one minute brother Alex a day and then from there begin a little more and a little more and a little more would be a great influence on their lives one minute how many have one minute that we can give the Lord can we try to read our Bibles for one minute amen Albuquerque also what was told in Albuquerque is that people uh on average how how would you say it in Spanish um on average I'm sorry uh di daily daily uh they use these things for on average four hours a day they check their social media at least 16 times a day so the Lord was telling the young people and brother Mike and brother Bernie theii if we have four hours that we're using this that we can give God a minute what do you think we give we give the Lord a minute the bad companies corrupt buenos Morales good morals so when you guys come young ladies young men adults elderly everyone when when we go with bad influences we have to not listen to that turn our back on it and walk towards the good influen thank you brother very simple right four hours a day they say that's tremendous because we're only awake for about 17 hours of the day we're on our onh or computer tremend no telephones for you guys no no no no no we should use them with order listen to our parents and just use them for emergencies okay you guys are too young to have Facebook pages [Laughter] Facebook that was part of the things that the Lord told us in Albuquerque isn't that tremendous and then in tuon we had a great time brother Junior preached the message so uh uh the spoken word is the Original Seed so amen if we plant and listen to the good influence and we plant that Original Seed in our hearts what's going to happen for us is there a kid that can tell us what will happen if we plant that seed in our heart somebody said something over here one of the young ladies somebody how about one of our youth young adults if you plant God's word in your heart what do you what kind of let me put it this way if you plant God's word in your heart what kind of fruit are you going to Bear bad fruit or good fruit Bernie good fruit brother Mike that's right good fruit amen amen okay so if you want to plant good fruit if you want to reap good fruit that's okay pry it's okay it's okay we love you amen that's what brother Junior spoke about oh do you want to say something okay please please when you're done okay when I'm done okay so God in Simplicity using discipline to manage our time and be able the good SE seed in our hearts give us success in our lives it will give us Faith to ask God but we need in hard times doesn't mean that the hard times aren't going to come hard times will come but if we have faith to believe him there's nothing stand in front of us we have a sister that's going to give us a short little testimony so we make her for welcome give her an [Applause] Applause hi again guys um I'd forgotten that I was trying to speak more Spanish um when I said My Testimony I forgot so I'll say this one in English but because I haven't practiced up with my Spanish yet but that's okay so this is just like a simple testimony about some thoughts that I had while I was in Albuquerque Albuquerque so like growing up whenever I would go to like special services or like never would be the convention time I would always have the wrong mindset and the wrong motives it was always more like what am I going to wear who am I going to see who am I going to meet like I guess guy wise like oh am I going to see a guy like are going to be cute guys there and all that um but when I was um on our way to Albuquerque Albuquerque um the Lord just reminded me of this scripture and it's Romans 1 11-2 and it says for I long to see you goe for I long to see you that I may impart unto you some spiritual gift to the end ye may be established that is that I may be comforted together with you by the mutual Faith both you and me praise the Lord and you know when I like when I thought of it it just kind of reminded me of you know exactly why I'm going you I'm not going there so I can look good so I can like meet a guy or anything like that but you know I truly that's when I truly realize that I'm going there for Fellowship because it's one of the most encouraging things to me to just be with people that love God as well I used to be really jealous and envious of people who seem to be doing better spiritually than me me like especially with my it sounds horrible but like with my own best friends like when they were doing really good spiritually I got really jealous of that and you know that's like when I was on my way to Albuquerque that's when I realized that you know we're not here to compete with each other at all and we're truly here to encourage each other cuz if you know how bad it feels to be down why are you going to go and try to make somebody else feel the same way that you are feeling so you know just be kind to whoever you meet because you really never know people are going through and you know when I came back from Albuquerque um Satan started putting really horrible thoughts in my brain and I started to believe that my experience wasn't real and you know kind of like the after Camp feeling like oh it wasn't really real you didn't really receive anything it was all emotion and I'm not going to lie you know for a long time I had felt that God wasn't really in my life anymore you know because of things that have happened in my life um just unfair situations but that doesn't mean that God's not with you through those unfair situations so you know the past couple weeks I've been really really I've been really honest with myself and exactly what it is I want from the Lord or what I want for myself and you know he's just slowly bringing me back to his feet you know in many ways through friends family just music especially music is huge influence for me and so so um in Tucson in tuon um it was the Sunday night service the play was really really cute um the little kids did an awesome job probably better than I would have been able to do and brother Caleb um started singing this song and he kept singing it over and over and over again I forgot exactly how it went but um when he started singing it over and over and over again you know at first I was like okay like song's getting kind of boring now change the song but something just told me to be still and so I was I just close my eyes and I started to just listen to brother Caleb singing and the congregation and I just truly felt the sweet Spirit of the Lord just [Music] fall so yeah that's just a little bit of what happened in Albuquerque for me and then in Tu um so if they ever do have Services again you know I'm definitely going to be there because it was a lot of fun um like brother Mike said you know it wasn't a lot of people at all but it was truly something amazing and you know I just hope that we all just I know it sounds like super cheesy like we all hope to like love each other and all that stuff but just to be considerate of each other and I think things would just go a lot better you know even if even if you don't like someone for whatever reason it is just be nice to them when you just show kindness when you just even if you have to like force yourself to be kind when you do that true you know eventually God will just place it in your heart even more and you know just you'll just start being more and more kind so just so yeah that's just what God has been showing me the past couple weeks God bless you Andy Reese we're gonna have Brother Andy Reese to come up can we make him feel welcome amen I want to give a little testimony real quick while um while he gets ready when we were in Tucson on the Sunday Night Service uh Andy played his special Andy and from the moment he hit the first notes on the saxophone and the piano was playing I just felt like that was when I had my blessing the Holy Ghost just came down in such a sweet way and everybody knew who was in control of that service Jehovah Gyra coming down speaking to his children and healing through music and I believe he is the same God yesterday today and forever and he continues to heal in many ways so if you need healing body mind Spirit Soul all of the above he's more than willing to heal us this even amen [Applause] [Music] amen [Music] oh [Music] h [Music] h [Music] [Music] d [Music] [Music] a [Music] a [Music] aah [Music] d [Music] amen amen amen that was awesome tremendous go yeah man isn't the Lord good hey man that was beautiful oh yes baby can you bring the kids up now am turn adanah here here's a little story me and

testimony can you hear me can you give the Lord a round of Praise really quick amen praise God it feels really good in here right now feels really good it's that same presence that comes you know when you seek the Lord he comes his presence comes it's very simple you know just to Humble ourselves and call on the presence of the Lord and he's faithful he shows up every time amen I just want to glorify God and give a couple testimonies I want to say first of all that I want to thank the Lord for my healing and for my daughter's healing and I've been i' this testimony is overdue I think I should have told it a while ago but I was um I was very sick for a while and I was very um I was having DIY spells and um I would just had a lot of worry on my mind and my heart because my daughter was very sick and uh she had a a stomach problem for months and she would wake up every day and she would be nauseous and and she was in [Music] pain and all I could do was just pray for her and just hold on to the promises of God and so we just kept praying and praying and it was just months it was taking a long time but the Lord kept telling me just hold on just hold I've always come through for you you know that I'm your God so don't doubt me now so I just kept believing and just praying for my daughter and and months kept going by and by and sister Bonnie checked her out and Bonnie said we're going to do certain things we're going to make some changes and we're going to trust in the Lord and she's going to be well and I believed it I just I I said Lord I know you're going to take care of take care of her like you always have it's just another trial so we just kept believing and um just like a few months ago a couple months ago um she started to feel better and she said Mom I'm feeling good I need to take the medicine and she started eating you know different things that she couldn't eat and that was a real test and I kept asking are you okay are are you fine said Mom I'm fine I'm Healed mom I said yes you are and I I just I was so grateful to God it's hard to be sick for a long time I know she suffered a lot and um the relief that I felt when she said I I'm fine Mom it just it took a burden off of me and I just I felt I just felt joy and then at the same time right after that um I started to feel better myself and the the dizzy spells that I was having I would I would close my eyes and the room would Spin and spin and spin and I I think I was just um just super you know nervous and worried about my daughter I think maybe that was causing it I don't know but but the Lord took with that away and I I'm been totally fine so God still does his work and and he's amazing and he keeps reminding me that he he's in control and there's nothing that he can't do for me and that he is ever present whenever I need him and that's the best thing that I I have is is his presence with me and I just wanted to share that amen thank you very much praise God Amen praise God he's still a Healer amen amen I know we have many other testimonies in the room and one of these days we would love to have you share them as you play softly I surrender all [Music] we're just
