[8:56] this world is judged mom now they
[9:01] advocate found in in first John 2:12
[9:05] now let's read that just a minute first
[9:09] John 2 and 12 I beg your pardon
[9:16] 1st John 1 and 2 there's I've got these
[9:19] wrote down first John 2:1 to tune my
[9:24] little children these things write on to
[9:27] you that you sin not and if any man sin
[9:31] we have an advocate with the father
[9:35] Jesus Christ the righteous who is
[9:39] advocate Jesus Christ the righteous and
[9:45] he is he is there a propitiation for our
[9:50] sins and not for ours only but also for
[9:54] the sins of the whole world what is the
[10:00] Holy Ghost
[10:01] it's an advocate what doesn't what isn't
[10:04] advocator what does it do make an
[10:06] advocate it has mercy it stands in your
[10:11] place it does things that you can't do
[10:15] it's it's a propitiation or your sin
[10:18] it's your righteousness it's your
[10:21] healing it's your life it's your
[10:25] resurrection it's all that God has for
[10:29] you he's an advocate now we could go
[10:33] into details with that and break that
[10:34] down of how that one it makes
[10:38] intercession for our ignorance sometimes
[10:41] we got the Holy Ghost we eagerly stagger
[10:44] into something the Holy Spirit started
[10:47] to make advocate for us he is our
[10:49] educator he stands our he's our attorney
[10:52] he stands there and pleads for us we
[10:56] don't plead for herself because the Holy
[10:58] Ghost in us pleads for us the Holy
[11:02] Spirit given utterance sometimes those
[11:04] words you can't understand
[11:06] and he makes intercession sparse that's
[11:10] what the Holy Ghost is when I walk in
[11:13] anything I walk like a little kid you
[11:16] walk like a little seller we're walking
[11:18] in a dark world full of enemies full of
[11:21] sin full of traps full of everything you
[11:25] say oh I'm afraid I'm afraid to take
[11:28] creature night I'm afraid to this I'm
[11:29] afraid I'll do this don't be afraid we
[11:33] have an advocate oh he spends by us he's
[11:41] at us and he makes intercession for us
[11:45] the Holy Spirit constantly constantly
[11:49] making an advocate for us all the time
[11:52] he is our educator oh how we thank
[11:56] confidence a seal a sign the spirit of
[12:02] life the God of heaven the comforter the
[12:06] lion the advocate what is he oh my we
[12:11] could go on for hours with it now we're
[12:14] going to change just for a minute now
[12:17] we're going to ask now promised to us in
[12:26] the last days this advocate he'll
[12:29] promise everything that we have talked
[12:33] about him tonight with 10,000 times more
[12:35] it was made a promise to us in the last
[12:38] days they didn't have it in that day
[12:41] they just had a seal in their flesh as a
[12:44] token and a sign believing it was coming
[12:47] and they walked by the shadow of the law
[12:50] which they were circumcised by flesh the
[12:54] day we don't walk by the shadow the law
[12:56] we walk by the power of the Resurrection
[12:58] we walk by the power of the Spirit who
[13:01] is our true seal our true advocate our
[13:05] true comforter our true sign that we
[13:08] have been born from above peculiar odd
[13:11] people acting funny taking God at His
[13:14] Word
[13:15] pulling everything else wrong God's
[13:18] words right
[13:19] that's all ma that's what the Holy Ghost
[13:22] do you want it would you love to have it
[13:26] let's see if it was promised now let's
[13:29] go back to Isaiah The Book of Isaiah
[13:32] let's get the 28th chapter of Isaiah now
[13:35] we're going to Isaiah 28 and we're going
[13:39] to begin about the let's take the eighth
[13:41] verse see what Isaiah said seven hundred
[13:44] and twelve years before it come we could
[13:47] say a lot about this go back all the way
[13:49] back but we'll just start by here and
[13:52] see if it was promised to the church
[13:54] what day wasn't supposed to come upon
[13:58] the life stage when there'd be a a
[14:00] corruption now I remember the words in
[14:02] plural days the last two days the last
[14:05] 2,000 years now not the eighth first all
[14:12] for all tables are full of filthiness
[14:16] told that there is no clean place Church
[14:23] around today he to find it look around
[14:27] see free in that day all tables while
[14:31] they go to the Lord's Supper and the
[14:35] first thing in the material line take an
[14:37] old piece of light bread or a soda
[14:38] cracker and break it up and make the
[14:42] communion when that's supposed to be
[14:44] made with Holy Ghost hands and on eleven
[14:47] bread Christ is not dirty and filthy and
[14:52] that represents you another thing they
[14:56] give it to people that drink la piel
[15:00] boom jus-just anything as long as they
[15:06] belong to the church or being if a man
[15:11] ever takes it when we're reading this
[15:13] sure he's reading and drinking damnation
[15:15] to himself not discerning the Lord's
[15:17] body
[15:17] they don't live the life keep away from
[15:20] it and if you don't take it it shows
[15:24] that your own conscience is guilty he
[15:25] that he does not has no
[15:27] mark with me Jesus death but all tables
[15:30] of the Lord has become full of Filth
[15:33] there's no one clean place listen if
[15:36] that don't picture today whom shall he
[15:39] who shall he teach knowledge and whom
[15:43] shall eat make understand doctrine who
[15:48] will understand knowledge who can he
[15:51] make to understand doctrine but bless
[15:54] God on Presbyterian on Methodist I'm
[15:58] Pentecostal I'm Nazarene I'm pilgrim
[16:02] holiness that don't mean one thing to
[16:05] God just another table

[16:19] you know when you got it we'll get into
[16:21] that Friday night who will I make
[16:25] knowing doctrine i watch damn bed or
[16:30] weaned from the milk and drawn from the
[16:34] breasts little babies say well I go to
[16:38] church
[16:39] my mama belong to this church I have
[16:41] nothing against that dear brother I
[16:43] realize this is being taped that's all
[16:46] right
[16:47] longer Mama's Church but listen mama
[16:51] walked in one light you're walking in
[16:53] another Luther walked in one night
[16:57] wesley walked in another wesley walked
[16:59] in one light pentecost walked in another
[17:02] but we were walking on higher than that
[17:04] today and if there's another generation
[17:06] will go beyond us back in the early days
[17:12] when the thing was wide way wide Luther
[17:17] taught justification by faith that was
[17:21] just to bring the people from
[17:22] Catholicism in to Protestantism into the
[17:26] fellowship around the word justification
[17:28] by faith as a big wide fear they never
[17:32] moved from that along came another
[17:34] revival closed John Wesley it shook him
[17:36] down from that brought her down
[17:39] to vacation leave a good clean holy line
[17:41] Thank You five by the Word of God gives
[17:45] joy in your heart that's shucks awful
[17:48] out of a Lutheran doctrine then a long
[17:50] time Pentecost with the baptism of Holy
[17:52] Ghost and narrowed it down again by
[17:54] receiving the Holy Ghost that's right
[17:56] and now that's begin to shake down and
[17:59] the gifts and the restoration and the
[18:02] Spirit of God has come in in the
[18:04] fullness of signs and wonders into the
[18:06] church and shuck Pentecost
[18:08] what is it we were so close to coming
[18:11] out of the Lord Jesus until the very
[18:14] spirit that was anything is working in
[18:16] the church doing the very same things
[18:18] that he did when he was your honor
[18:19] it's never been any word back from the
[18:22] time of the Apostles till this time fine
[18:26] it's why Narrows Mary Sarah what is it
[18:29] just like your hand come into a shadow
[18:30] the negative negative negative or what
[18:33] is - it's a reflection what was Luther a
[18:36] reflection of crime what was Wesley a
[18:38] reflection of crime look Billy Sunday's
[18:42] agent just ended the other day old dr.
[18:45] Whitley's taught right here on this
[18:46] pulpit the last one of the old school
[18:49] died around 90 again Billy Sunday was
[18:54] the revivalist to the nominal churches
[18:57] of his day he called all punches stand
[19:00] up then horror all you Methodists hit
[19:02] the sawdust rail preachers and all all
[19:04] you Baptists hit the sawdust trail he
[19:06] Presbyterians he pulled no punches
[19:09] he was the Billy Graham of this day
[19:12] notice and then the same time as a
[19:14] number of churches having their revival
[19:16] or taken place the full gospel is having
[19:19] a revival there come forth the Bosworth
[19:22] brothers miss wiglesworth and dr. prize
[19:25] Amy McPherson although look this legal
[19:29] work died one night dr. price died the
[19:32] next morning was in 24 hours I was on
[19:34] the field down my ends coming down look
[19:40] at you don't hear much of it agree and
[19:42] they don't hear much of all Oral Roberts
[19:43] I see my meeting shattering what's the
[19:45] matter we're at the end of another age
[19:47] how did Billy Sunday come in and then
[19:49] they come in just after great Moody
[19:53] when did moody come in just after Knox
[19:56] revival here when the Knox come in just
[19:59] after finish revival city after Calvin
[20:02] Calvin after so Wesley and Wesley after
[20:07] Luther on down through the ages come as
[20:10] soon as one revivals over God raises up
[20:13] another and throw in full right just
[20:14] keeps moving like that now we're at the
[20:17] end of this time each man has looked at
[20:20] the end of the injunction for the coming
[20:21] of Christ but they had a lot to look
[20:24] forward to the returning of the Jews
[20:26] sighing soldiers in the skies all the
[20:28] things that we see today but we're at
[20:31] the end them we are here now they know
[20:34] the church was a sieve power that would
[20:36] work in the church the same works of
[20:39] crime because as the shadow becomes
[20:41] deeper and deeper and respects more you
[20:44] take a shade farther away the shape the
[20:48] least reflection you get out of the
[20:50] shade after a while the shakiest closer
[20:53] closer to the tree in the shade is the
[20:55] same thing now the Spirit of God has
[20:57] worked under justification under loser
[20:59] thanks to the keishon under Wesley the
[21:01] baptism Holy Ghost under Pentecost and
[21:03] Garrett is in the last day performing
[21:06] and doing the very same thing that it
[21:08] did when it was in Christ the church in
[21:12] Christ has become one
[21:14] and as soon as they connect together
[21:16] that last link she'll go through the sky
[21:19] shopping up will come Wesley loser all
[21:22] rest them back in those days there he
[21:24] that first will be life he that slice
[21:27] will be first and there will come the
[21:30] resurrection we're at the end time
[21:33] listen that's what the Holy Ghost does
[21:36] the Holy Ghost by justification ceases
[21:39] to like shadow of it the Holy Ghost by
[21:41] sanctification a little deeper shadow
[21:43] the Holy Ghost Father baptism out of it
[21:46] a deeper shadow now the Holy Ghost by
[21:48] the restoration of its very person being
[21:51] in here forming signs and wonders I get
[21:53] into the beginning listen brother listen
[22:05] to this all tables are full of vomit
[22:07] there's no clean place who shall he
[22:10] teach knowledge whom shall he makes no
[22:13] one understand doctrine damn that are
[22:16] weaned from the milk and drawn from the
[22:19] breasts not little babies Presbyterian
[22:22] babies Methodist babies Pentecostal baby
[22:25] Lutheran babies Nazarene baby he wants
[22:28] somebody willing to get away from the
[22:30] breath nice and strong nice here comes

[22:39] precept line upon line upon line here a
[22:43] little and there a little far with

[22:47] speak to this people new movie says this
[22:52] is the rest worrying you make calls are
[22:54] weary to rest and this is the refreshing
[22:58] yet they would not hear the holy spirit
[23:03] that that isn't just the way it come on

[23:08] hundred and twelve years before come
[23:09] here it is on the day of Pentecost comes
[23:11] just exactly somebody said keeping the
[23:14] Sabbath day I'm not rejecting they're
[23:17] making light of anybody's church or
[23:20] religion but said the Sabbath day the
[23:23] Sabbath of God was arresting

[24:31] in the church prophesied exactly what it
[24:34] would be when it come it would be a
[24:36] everlasting eternal rest God made the
[24:42] world Hebrews the fourth chapter God
[24:44] made the world and rested on the seventh
[24:46] day that's right
[24:47] they stayed come back round honor you
[24:50] give that to the Jews for a covenant for
[24:52] a certain amount of time Ryan but they
[24:55] go and rest one day go back to the first
[24:58] day of the week start over again news
[25:00] start oh that is terrific God spoke up
[25:02] when God made the world in six days when
[25:04] he went to rest he rested from that home
[25:07] drying that settled it he didn't come
[25:10] back on the eighth day and start again
[25:12] it was only a shadow now that was a
[25:16] tight like the moon to the Sun but when
[25:19] the Sun comes up we don't need the
[25:20] moving no more now notice this on
[25:24] revelations 11 the woman with the moon
[25:26] under a feet in the side of her head oh
[25:28] we could go through the Bible we led to
[25:30] live and show you these but what is it
[25:33] when the Bible said in Hebrews the
[25:36] fourth chapter if Jesus would have given
[25:39] them a rest day he would

[25:49] and I will give you rest then we find
[25:58] that when we come to him for he said he
[26:01] brews for that is entered into Jesus

[39:20] to you
[39:21] no doubts an instant what you got - I
[39:24] got segment I've got something in my
[39:27] heart that started about 10 days ago I
[39:30] was in the upper room up there and all
[39:32] the sudden all the promises that God
[39:34] made I've walked with Jesus Christ for
[39:37] three and a half years I feast with him
[39:39] out pulling in the feet I've done these
[39:41] different things and I've seen heal the
[39:43] sick I he kept telling me the father's
[39:46] envy but when I leave he'll coming you
[39:49] but I couldn't understand that but he
[39:51] said I don't expect you to understand it
[39:54] you don't understand these things you
[39:55] just give him I don't understand it yet
[39:58] and don't tell me you do because you
[40:00] don't think so I can't understand it I
[40:03] can't explain it but one thing I know I
[40:04] got it was you say that's not
[40:08] scientifically oh sure it is look at
[40:10] that life when Benjamin Franklin called
[40:13] it he said I got it he didn't know what
[40:15] he had but he had it and I want somebody
[40:18] tell me tonight what lectricity is they
[40:21] don't know yet what it is but we got it
[40:24] that's right there's no man knows what
[40:27] lectricity is they can harness it make
[40:30] it light make it burn they can act but
[40:32] it's it's generated by generators to
[40:35] pieces running together like that it
[40:36] produces that and that's all they know
[40:38] it'll give my it's got power in it
[40:40] that's like the Spirit of God when you
[40:43] get one piece is you the other piece is
[40:44] God and get them lying around together
[40:46] like that it'll do something for you
[40:48] it'll give light it'll give power you
[40:51] don't know what it is never will know
[40:53] what it is but you don't you got it
[40:54] that's one thing sure and it's firing
[40:56] it's yours
[40:57] it says sure what's that light show

[41:11] thing they know we know that they're
[41:13] injured more nuts you see like that

[41:21] they've been with that fisherman that
[41:22] carpenter talk Jesus I tell you because
[41:26] they're doing the same things he does
[41:27] that's what the Holy Ghost is is Jesus
[41:30] living in the eager fishermen a carton
[41:33] dirt or whatever injured preacher
[41:35] whatever it is it's a man that wants to
[41:38] be eager to the things of the world and
[41:40] I thought of Jesus come into him the
[41:41] Spirit of God the seal the comforter he
[41:44] don't care about prestige all thing he
[41:46] wants his Bob when God was sitting in
[41:50] order he said all you Levi I've called

[48:42] respected God feared God a good man good
[48:45] Presbyterian methodist bad dis or
[48:47] something nothing a very good man but
[48:50] one day God said he's good man so I miss

[49:12] are and while Peter yet spake these
[49:15] words to how they went back in the
[49:17] beginning it same things I'm talking
[49:19] about how God promised to poured out the
[49:21] Holy Ghost while he spake these words
[49:23] the Holy Ghost fell on me yeah that's
[49:29] what the Holy go see who is far sure and
[49:31] they were all filled with the Holy Ghost
[49:33] now notice in Ephesians that was a
[49:37] Baptist brother he is first a lawyer
[49:39] smart intelligent man knows the law rich
[49:42] man a scholar one day he got reading the
[49:45] Bible he's seen there become one by the
[49:46] name of the Messiah and when he did that
[49:50] one he began to hear about this Jesus he
[49:53] said I'm convinced now I only profess my
[49:56] faith that Jesus is the Christ the Son
[49:59] of God he was a real Bank area come on I
[50:03] openly profess that Jesus is the Christ
[50:05] you got to do it so much that God caught
[50:07] him in the ministry I'll always speak to
[50:09] a true heart and there was a little tip
[50:12] maker down there banana of Aquila and
[50:14] Priscilla a husband and wife David
[50:17] tentmakers Acts the 18th chapter tells
[50:19] you that Paul they were friends of his

[50:23] hands of Paul in his teaching they heard
[50:25] this revival there so he went over is
[50:27] only about ten or twelve painting it so
[50:30] he went over there to look at and he
[50:32] heard this preacher preaching the
[50:33] sincerity as already said you know I
[50:34] agree he'd listen to the truth by his
[50:37] service or we call him out behind the
[50:38] tent and said look we got a little
[50:40] brother about so high a little
[50:41] hook-nosed view and but when he comes

[51:46] well we was baptized we own the baptism
[51:48] of John he said he only baptized unto
[51:50] repentance they need to be bond him to
[51:53] come that's on Jesus Christ and when he
[51:55] urged this they were baptized over in
[51:58] the name of Jesus Christ and Paul ladies
[52:00] hands upon them and the Holy Ghost came
[52:02] on them and they spoke in tongues and
[52:04] prophesied now down how do we do it I
[52:12] want to tell you something I've told you
[52:16] I let you out early you don't want the
[52:17] Holy Ghost is for the last scripture far
[52:20] tonight
[52:20] I got another bunch down here but we'll
[52:23] have to omit that let's turn over to
[52:25] first Corinthians 12 and then we'll read
[52:28] this and then we all will close all
[52:32] right
[52:33] first corinthians the twelfth chapter
[52:37] how many breeds the teaching of st. paul
[52:41] he said in Galatians 1:18 for the angel
[52:43] caught a same difference
[52:45] let him be accursed let alone a preacher
[52:47] if an angel from heaven come down taught
[52:51] anything different let him be cursed
[52:52] don't have nothing to do with it now
[52:54] watch this first crazy is 12 how how
[52:59] many knows that we have stopped the beat
[53:03] in Christ an order to go on the
[53:05] reservation because it's his body they
[53:08] God promised to raise up a man
[53:10] there's no other way there's not another
[53:14] way if you're outside of crime you might
[53:16] look back here and believe on me
[53:19] they sure I believe him he's a son of
[53:22] God good my brother I'm ready to shake
[53:25] your hand when you say that I believe on
[53:27] him I'll confess him as my savior that's
[53:30] good but you're still not easy I'll
[53:33] shake hands with the preacher I'll
[53:35] confess my sins that's still and
[53:37] anything now watch see what Paul said
[53:40] how you get in crying how you going to
[53:43] be noted as a circumcision Abraham they
[53:45] give a sign listen to this now first
[53:47] Corinthians twelfth chapter and let's
[53:50] begin at the twelfth first far as the
[53:54] body is one has many members and all
[53:58] members of that one body being many are
[54:01] one body so also is Christ not divided
[54:09] one listen follow five one church some
[54:16] he's reading behind by one handshake by
[54:22] one water
[54:22] oh and somebody's wrong by one spirit
[54:30] into the capsule that's Holy Spirit by
[54:35] one spirit are we all baptized into one
[54:39] body whether we be Jews or Gentiles
[54:45] whether we be bond or free and have been
[54:49] all made to drink into one spirit the
[54:57] body of Christ is one spirit or every
[55:02] member from penne pasta this time drinks
[55:05] of the same new wine the same Holy Ghost
[55:09] bringing forth the strain wings off how
[55:14] do we do it by one theory if God opens
[55:20] door the Holy Spirit what is it
[55:23] if God opened doors if the sign if the
[55:27] seal is the comforter it's an advocate
[55:31] it's an assurance it's read it sees its
[55:35] goodness
[55:36] if healing is right it's God's opened
[55:40] door to all these things it's God's open
[55:45] door just Christ which has God through
[55:47] that he raised up Jesus from the dead
[55:50] and those that are dead in Christ will
[55:53] God bring with him at the resurrection
[55:56] grieve not the Holy Spirit till they are
[56:07] your Redemption
[56:10] how many pleases
[56:12] what is cry what is the Holy Ghost it's
[56:17] not something people laugh at it is some
[56:20] people like that but it ain't to the
[56:22] believers to the unbeliever I wish I had
[56:26] a long to the release I like take
[56:28] tomorrow night and tell you what it is
[56:29] to the unbeliever let me just run
[56:31] through just a moment of time
[56:34] it's a laughingstock
[56:37] it's a snare it's a summary box it's
[56:43] dead it's eternal separation from God I
[56:49] just can't think of the things that it
[56:52] is to the unbeliever
[56:54] remember the same ring that the
[56:59] unbeliever made fun of was the same ring
[57:02] that saved no and his face the same
[57:08] spirit Holy Ghost that people are making
[57:12] fun of and says it's crazy and a bunch
[57:14] of enough that's insanity
[57:18] if the same thing that'll rapture their
[57:21] church and take it up with the life
[57:23] States will bring judgment upon the
[57:25] unbelievers
[57:28] that's what the Holy Ghost is blessed
[57:32] are they may I say this in the sincerity
