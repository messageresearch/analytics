there's a lot of uh very educational programs on tv documentaries that talk about very spectacular things specific to nature or things that happen in our world well we're very blessed that we we have uh the next video clip that we're going to be showing you of the 20th century prophet and i want the children to pay very close attention to what the questions that they're asking brother branham and as you hear brother branham answer those questions for those of you that may be new and don't really know who brother branham is i'd like you to just watch it with your heart and see what god has in store for you so if the brothers would would turn the lights off offer me in the back and and the brothers in the back would go ahead and start the video clip first i'd be great it's just going to be a short clip that we're going to play here as a special you can shut these off too brother thank you may i present my wife honey this is brother leroy and paul cop of los angeles california delighted to have you in our home brother carl brother branham in your two great campaigns at los angeles at calvary temple we noticed that the lord jesus christ worked with you in a very special manner with these marvelous gifts these earning of the spirits of men's hearts as well as the sicknesses of the body and the signs of healing and miracles that were wrought we thought it was wonderful awareness to brother branham in hearing more about this unique ministry that god has given you very well brother cop let's go back to the beginning i was born in eastern kentucky in a little log cabin near burtsville kentucky the morning of my birth i'm told of my parents that there was a light came into the room and hung over me my people was not a religious people they did not go to any church of course this caused quite a stir among them it's followed me all the days of my life recently they took a picture of it in the scientific world as shown here you're probably familiar with this picture it was proven by science that was the only supernatural being that was ever scientifically photographed to my opinion it's the same angel of god that followed the children of israel from egypt and to palestine you know as a scholar yourself that was the angel of the covenant none other than our lord jesus christ and when here on earth manifested in flesh he did not claim to be a great person he said the son can do nothing just as the father shows him john the fifth chapter perhaps you're acquainted with it the scripture jesus passed through this famous pool of bethesda he find many crippled people there blind halt lame waiting for the moving of the waters it was strange that he just ministered to one but if you'll notice he knew where that person was the father had showed him he healed this one perhaps he he wasn't crippled he was just laying on a pallet but jesus healed him and then farther in the chapter we find about the 19th verse that he was questioned by the jews perhaps it would be questionable today why god would pass through a place where all those people were lame and halt and blind and would not heal them all but here i'll quote his words he said verily verily i say unto you the son can do nothing of himself but what he sees the father do this doeth the son likewise then according to his own words his ministry was based upon visions from his father would not be strange then that his ministry should be carried on as he promised his disciples the things that i do shall you do also greater than this shall you do for i go unto my father he said a little while and the world seeth me no more yet you shall see me for i'll be with you even in you to the end of the world jesus christ the same yesterday today and forever resurrection of jesus christ living among his people performing the same signs and wonders that he did when he was here on earth at the age of seven we moved from kentucky to indiana up the road a bit from where we live now we packed our water then from a well some city block i suppose behind the old country home one beautiful september afternoon while coming from the pump with some water it was a stately proper tree stood about halfway between the pump and the home passing by there there was a whirl of wind in the tree what we call here uh whirlwind why it was nothing odd for that time of year in this part of the country but it remained in the tree it didn't leave i stopped to see what it was and a voice spoke from it saying do not never smoke or drink or defile your body in any way for there will be a work for you to do when you get older frightened that's not a word part i ran home quickly telling my mother that a man spoke to me out of a tree well she thought i was nervous she put me to bed but from then on visions begin to come and when this comes up on me it produces a vision i'm able to tell people what's wrong with them and what they must do in life and the sins that they are holding back in their life at the age of 37 one night i was praying in my room and when i raised up i noticed the light on the floor and looking around to see where it come from it was coming from above the pillar of fire was hanging just above i'm throwing the light on the floor i heard someone walking i looked coming through the room coming into this light came a man and human figure he'd be about 200 pounds of weight he had dark hair to his shoulder and olive complexion is barefooted of course i was frightened and he said to me fear not and as soon as i heard that voice i knew it was the same voice that it always spoke to me but the first time i'd ever seen him in human form he said i'm sent from the presence of god to tell you that you're to pray for sick people great signs and wonders will be following your ministry and you'll be praying for kings and monarchs and so forth well i told him i was a poor man i had a no education i would not be able to do this job he said as moses was given two signs of confirmation of his ministry that i would be given two signs one would be the praying for the sick the miracles and the other would be you know the very secrets of the people's heart i told him that i had been praying about this that the people told me it was of the devil the ministry he referred to me many scriptures such as when philip found nathanael and nathanael came to jesus while jesus told him where he had been for he was under the tree when nathanael found him and many other scriptures such as the woman at the well how that she was revealed her sins to her when jesus told her that she had five husbands she ran into this city and said this is the christ many other scriptures he referred to i told him i would go he gave me the assurance that he would be with me always as you know brother cop in the world knows other great things that's been taking place in the ministry we were thinking about whether these visions i would remember him very long some time ago i had one about four years ago to be exact of a little boy being dead on the side of the road struck by a car and killed and he was to be raised from the dead well i told everybody about it prophesied throughout the united states and canada thousands of bibles had it written on their flower leaks that this would take place one day while we were having campaigns in the scandinavian country we were coming down through finland from kovil and there was a group of people gathered on the side of the road they were hovered over some sort of a farm we got out to look there it was the little boy everything just seen just the way it was shown to me i said to brother moore look at your bible and see if this isn't the scene yes he said i knelt down and asked our lord jesus to confirm his word that he had showed me and it told me would come to pass little boy was brought to life again by our lord jesus he's alive and healthy today brother cop this is just a few of the things that our lord jesus is doing today in the ministry that he has committed to me to my humble opinion is to confirm his word the things that he promised that would happen in this day we are seeing him take place today now concerning the campaigns in israel brother cop i'll be very happy to serve our lord in israel i believe that my ministry will be very effective to the jews because as the scripture says the jews seek signs the greeks wisdom we believe many jews and others there in the holy land will come to believe that the lord jesus christ is a messiah when they see a christian fulfilling the prophecy of joel in the old testament yes brother cop i'm sure that you're referring to joel's prophecy in the old testament joel 2 28 how that he prophesied saying that in the last days he would pour out his spirit upon all flesh the sons and daughters would prophesy the old man would dream dreams and the young men would see visions well by the bottom i guess we'll have to say goodbye for this time it certainly has been a great pleasure and very edifying we'll have to be running along but we will see your god willing in chicago in the next couple of days so gentlemen it's been a pleasure to have you in our home tonight we'll be praying together for the success of the chicago meeting and by god's grace i hope to meet you there in the next few days would you care for some key before going thank you very much mr brown that'll be just fine thank you thank you can we give the lord jesus a clap offering we want to talk about uh documentaries and reality tv i don't think there's nothing that's much better than that amen i think that we all understand how god has always dealt with his people according to his scripture that his word will always first come to his prophets and uh according to the scripture in amos and here brother branham is is telling us about his supernatural birth right you know there's a lot of things that we can believe in a lot of things that we hear and a lot of things that we see today in in in this technology age that we live in but if you want the truth there ain't no greater truth than what you just saw there and that's god's prophet pointing us back to god's word amen so there's just so much there that we can talk about it all afternoon but we must continue so i'm going to ask brother how to come on up but isn't he wonderful amen god bless you can uh we please stand we want to welcome you this afternoon to children's church you can turn around and shake your brother's hand and say god bless you with the big giant smile it's always awesome to see a big giant smile on your brother or sister because it brings happiness and not only did he sense the prophet he knows this prophet brought us the word to bring us out of the confusion so we're blessed people today someone's so we got at this time we're going to be going into our tithing our thanksgivings first of all how many that brings you know that lets me know yes that there's people that believe in the lord so we're thankful today what god's given us if you got a petition today in a and you need something from the lord whether you're a small a small little brother or small little sister you're older the master you know that's that's something you got to turn around tell your neighbor god hears prayers still he hears prayers maybe we're out in the world no without god and that prayer reached us and god's grace came down that's why we're here hey man so if you have a petition today let us bring it before the lord as our brother mike prays for him lord heavenly father because she will not it may be in the name of the lord jesus christ amen amen is oh is is me i shall die is oh like a tree hallelujah i shall amen god bless you we're going to be receiving the word tonight how many are ready for the that portion amen i believe brother frederick hawley is going to be speaking tonight or or reading or whatever the lord has in his heart to to say to us amen are you ready let's sing this song only believe amen is is oh all these oh all things are possible all things are possible oh all things are possible only god bless everyone tonight once again it's a sunday afternoon late sunday evening we find ourselves here and we believe that it's it's the lord's calling that we learn about the life of a prophet the prophet our seventh church age messenger william marion branham as you seen on the previous video very precious video taken in his home in 1953 the house that that video was was done in was built in 1948 uh brother brannon had spoke of some experiences that came to mind as short as that video was it was very deep and rich in what he shared with us what a privilege we have to have a brother such as owen jorgensen write a series of books about brother brennan in my humble opinion he brought the story forth complete and as accurate as humanly possible he consulted a variety of resources including the listening to all of the sermons that are on the media that's available for brother brannon i believe in it's a neighborhood of 1200 sermons he also consulted many people that knew brother brandon firsthand interviewed them meticulously made notes and also consulted other source material that was very near and dear to brother brandon that would help him compile this it was a work of love for him it took a long time he prayed on it he was at a point where he had completed the first book but he did not have the means to publish it he prayed on it and i don't remember the time frame exactly after that but he he received a communication from brother perry greene in tucson saying don't worry this will move forward as we've been doing this series since march of this year we have completed six chapters of book one we are seeing the shaping of the man called william mary and brennan by the by the lord the lord is laying out a path for him and it's not always clear as to what that path is at the time to brother brandon in his life that he's experiencing these things but we have the advantage of seeing the testimonies and hearing the testimonies more precisely to understand what happened and and how it unfolded so without further ado our ambition tonight is to to read three chapters chapter seven eight and nine and if you would please be seated to preserve the continuity of our presentation we will flow from one chapter to the next until we complete the third chapter the first chapter is chapter 7 entitled fleeing to the desert 1927-1929 chapter 8 is entitled the sign follows 1929 and then chapter 9 is entitled his last chance 1930-1932 as with any of the chapters that we have covered and will cover each one is crucial to the formation and development of our prophet i appreciate your presence it's an honor to do a live narration of this and i'd like to thank brother bernie our assistant pastor brother johnny alvarado senior and all of the ministry and support that i've been receiving during this this presentation that we've been doing and it's it inspires me to to do this in such a way that would honor brother branham and and in in the bigger picture we want to d we want to increase our understanding for our profit so without further ado we'll get started when william branham arrived in phoenix arizona mr francisco paid him three dollars for helping with the driving that was all the money billy had in the world but he wasn't worried he was sure some opportunity would turn up it was december in the year 1927. he was 18 years old and bursting with enthusiasm at his new chance in life after sending a letter of explanation home to his mother billy set off to explore the town soon he happened upon an informal rodeo that made him think i'm a real good rider since i'm broke why not get myself some easy money at this rodeo but i'll have to get me a pair of chaps before i go out there in front of all those cowboys he walked down the street to the nearest clothing store and tried on a pair of leather chaps they were magnificent the word arizona was embossed on the belt and they had a steer head worked into each legging with brass buttons for eyes but they were far too long the leather leggings dragged on the floor billy looked at himself in the mirror and thought i look like a bantam rooster mostly fluffing feathers the store clerk said this pair is 25 sir billy was glad for an excuse to turn him down i'm afraid three dollars is all the money i've got the clerk suggested you better compromise with a pair of levi jeans billy bought a pair of levi's and a cowboy hat then returned to the rodeo on top of one fence at a line of bow-legged disfigured cowboys that had looked like they had been through a few cattle drives and range wars billy thought that's where i belong he climbed up on the fence beside them everyone around him was murmuring with excitement billy had arrived just when a famous rider was mounting a notorious wild stallion the horse was boxed into a stall not far away billy watched a long-legged rider drop down on the saddle and he thought if this fellow can't ride that horse then i will the instant the gates sprang open the horse snorted and leaked from its stall with all four feet in the air when it hit the ground it bounded up again twisting its body and kicking its hind legs all at once the rider sailed from the saddle like a straw scarecrow landed with a bone jarring thud and lay motionless in the middle of the corral blood pouring from his nose while the pickup man caught this stallion and put it back in a pen others loaded the unconscious cowboy into an ambulance and drove him away a man rode slowly along the fence where billy sat with all those leathery cowboys he said i'll give fifty dollars to any man who can stay on that horse for thirty seconds the man kept stooping to look at the cowboys in their eyes and repeat his offer no one took him on then the man stopped in front of billy and asked are you a rider no sir billy said sheepishly billy hired on at a cattle ranch northwest of phoenix near a small town called wickenburg his horse riding skills quickly improved until soon he was doing his share of the ranch work a real cowboy just like he had dreamed he would be the beauty of the prairie surpassed his wildest imaginations around him rugged mountains jutted up from the prairie floor giant saguaro cacti dotted the desert flats in the sloping canyon walls the desert was a picture of diversity abounding with prickly pear a small cactus that looked like a beaver tail with long wicked spikes the pin cushion cactus which was covered so thickly with tiny needles that it looked like fur the barrel cactus which looked like a barrel with spiny ribs and the low bushy trees known by their spanish name of palo verde meaning green stick the elusive wildlife also fascinated him gila monsters sidewinder rattlesnakes kangaroo rats and javelina hogs it was also exotic so different from the woodlands of the ohio river valley and to think here he was in the middle of it on a horse kicking up prairie dust working with cowboys and longhorn steers this was living what could be better he felt as though he had stepped into one of those romantic western movies he had watched when he was a boy but after a year and a half of ranch work the illusion of perfection began to wear off as the summer of 1929 plotted on billy grew increasingly dissatisfied many times he wondered what was wrong he had come to the desert to find peace and fulfillment but somehow peace and fulfillment were eluding him he was not happy not entirely something was still missing in his life but what finally it came time for the fall roundup throughout every summer many local ranchers grazed their herds on the same rangelands high up in the mountains where the grass grew thick between tall pine trees every fall they worked together to round up the scattered cattle herding them down to the valley ranches and then separating them by brands last year billy had regarded the fall roundup as the most exciting thing he had ever done but this year he was troubled by that same uneasiness that had dogged him all summer what was wrong when evening came on the trail billy slipped the saddle off his horse and set it near the campfire for a pillow after supper he leaned back against his saddle to watch the sun dip behind the mountains flinging brilliant orange pink and red streamers into the sky an old texan named slim tuned his guitar each night slim serenaded the desert with cowboy ballads accompanied by another cowboy who blew through a comb making a piece of paper was in harmony slim sang last night as i lay on the prairie i gazed at the stars in the sky and i wondered if ever a cowboy could drift to that sweet by-and-by there's a road to that bright happy region and the trail there is dim so they say but the broad one that leads to perdition is posted in blaze all the way they speak of another great owner and he's never overstocked so they say he'll always make room for a center that'll drift on the narrow straight way they say he will never forsake you and he knows every action and look for safety we'd better get branded have our name on his great tally book for they say there will be a great roundup when cowboys like doggies will stand to be marked by the writers of judgment who are posted and know every brand i guess i will be a stray yearling just a man that's condemned to die i'll be cut in the bunch with the rusties when the boss of those riders comes by billy understood what the words of the ballot implied stray yearlings were unbranded cattle that ended up as soup meat and what about that great owner with this tally book billy wondered if that could be what was troubling him was it something to do with god slim strummed another tune this time at old church hymn down at the cross where my savior died down where for cleansing from sin i cried there to my heart was the blood applied glory to his name listening to that slow lingering melody billy felt a distinct ache in his heart he turned over and pulled the blanket up around his head leaving just enough space for his eyes and nose the stars seemed so close as though they were pasted just above the mountains in the everlasting whisper of the breeze through the pine trees billy imagined he heard god calling him as he had called his first son gone astray adam adam where art thou after three weeks the roundup ended the cowboys headed back to the ranch to get their paychecks and to read their mail billy had a letter waiting from his mother postmarked a few weeks earlier among the other bits of news she mentioned that edward was very sick billy took it lightly supposing his brother had a cold or the flu that afternoon all the cowboys drove down from phoenix to celebrate although billy did not feel as festive as the others he tagged along for the change of scenery when the ranch hands filed into a saloon billy wandered off down the street by himself his heart still felt trouble what was wrong he definitely was not homesick he loved arizona loved the desert and enjoyed his work but somehow he still felt hollow inside incomplete he could not figure it out he sat for a while watching the traffic a pretty little spanish girl strolled by fluttered her eyelashes at him and dropped her white handkerchief billy his thoughts elsewhere said hey you dropped your hanky the girl picked it up and continued walking billy heard some music coming from farther down the street he followed the sound until he came to an empty rodeo arena there next to the bucking stalls an old cowboy was strumming a guitar and singing down at the cross where my savior died down wherefore cleansing for sin i cried there to my heart was the blood applied glory to his name but this cowboy sang with more feeling than slim did on the prairie this man sang to him like he meant it tears were running down his pockmarked cheeks at the end of the chorus he turned to billy and said brother you don't know what it is until you receive this wonderful jesus christ and he sang the chorus again glory to his name billy pulled his hat down and walked away his heart churned with inexpressible feelings by the time billy wandered back to the saloon his fellow ranch hands were laughing uproariously shooting at one another's toes to make each other dance betting each other five dollars they could walk a straight line and every one of them so drunk they had trouble staying on the sidewalk billy herded all of them into the car and drove them back to wickenburg the next morning when bill entered the mess hall he was given a note that said bill come out to the north pasture very important pop an old lone star ranger was waiting for him by the corral gate i am afraid i have bad news for you pop said he handed billy a telegram that read your brother edward died last night come home at once the news stunned him it was the first death he had experienced in his immediate family he turned away from pop and looked out across the yellow sun parts prairie tears running down his cheeks he thought of how hard life had been for the two of them as boys going to school without enough clothes on without school books or paper or pencils and sometimes without enough food to eat then billy remembered stealing that one handful of popcorn from his brother oh if he could only go back and live it over he would never steal such a treat from a poor hungry friend but he couldn't live it again now he couldn't even say he was sorry edward was gone billy wondered if edward was ready to meet god then he the thought struck him how about himself was he ready to meet god billy returned to jeffersonville for the funeral at the conclusion of his sermon reverend mckinney said there may be some here who do not know god if so except him now billy gripped his seat to keep from standing up something strange was tugging at his heart some kind of magnetism he that he didn't understand whatever it was it was making him miserable after the funeral billy planned to go back to arizona but his mother begged so hard for him to stay in indiana that billy finally agreed provided he could find some work soon he landed a job digging ditches to lay gas pipelines for the local public service company public service indiana he decided he would stay in jeffersonville at least for a while snow fell late in the fall of 1929 when billy woke up and saw the ground all white and cold he took one of his mother's blankets drove out to the cemetery swept the snow off edward's grave then stretched a blanket over the fresh mound of dirt he wanted edward to be warm in october of 1929 the new york stock market crashed plunging the united states into the worst economic nightmare it had ever seen thousands of banks locked their front doors while the helpless bankers tiptoed out back one step ahead of their angry depositors eventually the great depression touched every area of the economy factories either cut back production or closed entirely farmers tightened their belts or went bankrupt unemployment rose sharply until one out of every four american workers languished in idleness although william branham's job at the jeffersonville public service department paid only 20 cents an hour he considered himself lucky to be working at all he still planned to someday devote his life to fur trapping in the mountains out west but for now his paycheck was needed at home his father's health was failing due to his continued heavy drinking charles branham now 38 years old was not only out of work but his chances of getting a steady job and keeping it were slim on november 2nd 1929 ella branham bore her 10th and last child finally after nine sons finally she had a girl ella named her daughter faye dolores branham but she called her by her middle name so out of the 11 branhams living in one house only billy had full-time employment billy felt an obligation to help support the rest of his family at least for a few more years working for public service indiana agreed with billy's temperament his job kept him outside year round and the task varied from week to week so that he seldom was bored one week he might be digging ditches delay gas mains another week he might be reading meters or repairing gas leaks or climbing power poles to repair electrical transmission lines the only part of hit the job he disliked was turning off the electricity on cons on customers who couldn't pay their bills and with the depression deepening that happened far too often to suit him as glad as billy was for his public service company job still eight dollars a week did not stretch far in a household of 11 people so when he was offered part-time work as a deputy game warden for the state of indiana he jumped at the chance it meant he would get out of town on a regular basis to patrol the backwoods he thought of being paid for doing what he loved to do anyway seemed perfect in reality it never turned out that way his pay was supposed to be a commission on the number of tickets he issued to gain law of violators but billy could never bring himself to write out a ticket he felt that more good could be accomplished by sitting down with a poacher and lecturing him on the benefits of game conservation and the importance of obeying state laws in effect billy ended up donating his time but to him the satisfaction he gained from getting out of town and tramping the wooded countryside was reward enough one day billy was scheduled to patrol henryville state park 20 miles north of jeffersonville as soon as he boarded the greyhound bus a strange feeling swept over him like a pressure almost though some unseen force was pushing against him the bus was crowded passengers filled every seat and many stood in the owl billy jostled to the center of the bus stopping between a hefty middle-aged woman and a sailor the woman looked up and said hello as the bus rolled away from the station billy answered how'd he do and gazed out of the window watching houses glide by that strange force was pushing against him more strongly now it seemed to be coming from this heavyset woman out of the corner of his eye billy could tell she was staring directly at his face she made him feel uncomfortable soon she started a conversation are you an officer billy wore his game warden uniform with a pistol tucked in a holster at his side i'm a conservation officer he returned you're lonesome aren't you billy mask is surprised no ma'am he lied well you're not at your home she said i'm at as much of a home as i've got she shook her head no you were born for the west that shocked billy as much as if he had poured as she had poured ice water over his head say what are you talking about she said maybe i'd better explain myself you see i'm an astrologer billy groaned inwardly thinking here's another one of the of them funny people he moves away from her closer to the sailor she followed him staggering a little with the rocking of the bus she said i'd like to talk with you a few minutes billy kept looking ahead acting like he didn't hear her she persisted could i speak with you just a moment billy ignored her he thought this is not very gentlemanly of me but i don't want to talk to her yet the woman would not leave him alone say you the conservation officer can i speak with you a minute finally billy turned and said curtly what do you want he felt guilty for acting so rude but he really did not want to talk with an astrologer he remembered what that gypsy fortune teller had said to him at the carnival and the memory made him uneasy the woman asked are you a christian no he snapped and what's that to you she shrugged oh i just wondered did you know that you were born under a sign billy swallowed hard look lady i don't want to know nothing about that c i know i'm being short with you but i mean it i don't want to know nothing about it she retreated a little way oh don't be so hard well i don't mean to hurt your feelings but i don't know nothing about any religious things and i don't want to know billy turned away from her and stared past the sailor toward the front of the bus my you shouldn't act like that this has nothing to do with religion i'm on my road to chicago to see my son who is a baptist minister i work in the white house did you know that the position of the stars affects events here on earth i know nothing about it billy said she said there's a sailor standing in front of you ask him if the moon doesn't control the tides i've got sense enough to know that snap bill the woman continued well there are many other heavenly bodies that have significance on earth if i could tell you exactly when you were born would you believe me billy frowned uncomfortably you can't do it in the first place she smiled oh yes i can you were born on april 6 1909 at five o'clock in the morning billy's gruff facade crumbled into astonishment that's right now tell this sailor when he was born she said i couldn't do it you see you were born under a sign haven't ministers ever talk to you about this i have nothing to do with preachers nothing at all the woman's eyes drifted away for a moment as her mind followed that thought isn't it strange that preachers wouldn't know that billy repeated i don't fool around where they're at she again focus her eyes on him look i want to tell you something you were born under a sign as a gift to mankind if you could only recognize it he interrupted maybe i'll be another daniel boone i like to hunt and i was born in kentucky no that isn't what i'm talking about well maybe i'll be a businessman i've got a grammar school education she did not seem amused that's not what i'm talking about i don't know what you'll be but i can see by your aura that you were born as a gift do you remember the story about how the wise men were led to a star by the baby jesus i don't know nothing about religion but have you heard about the wise men coming to see the baby jesus haven't you yes well what are wise men oh they were just wise men that's all i know she explained the wise men were the same thing i am they were astrologers star gazers you know before god does anything on earth he always declares it in the heavens first that's what he did when jesus was born three heavenly bodies lined up and formed a conjunction that caught the attention of some astrologers living in the east one of them was from the lineage of ham another shem and the other japeth the three sons of noah they represented all the peoples of the earth each of these three men traveled west separately not knowing the others were coming until they met at jerusalem then they went to bethlehem and found the baby jesus they knew jesus was the one they were looking for because of the color of his aura you know what an r is don't you it's the supernatural light of the soul everyone has an aura they come in different colors and each color means something gold means a gift from god so these three wise men worshiped jesus and gave him gifts they departed just as those three heavenly bodies were separating into their individual orbits in commemoration of the greatest gift god ever gave to mankind his own son jesus every time those three heavenly bodies
