to him salvation is free yeah yeah what do you think we have so many people here we were charging and they got the work they wouldn't be here well I guess you got a point there it is free how many are happy that salvation is free you don't have to pay for it you don't have to do anything you just have to accept him accepting well I mean I I know you want to do stuff for the Lord and you want to have this title in that position and this thing I know a lot of the preachers on TV have fancy cars yeah like suits I saw this Joel Osteen guy and he's like ask whatever you want I want my Mercedes and I want big stuff you know cuz the Lord said ask whatever you want in my name and they'll give it to you yeah but the Bible says seek ye first the kingdom of God and everything else that you need will be added to you well so you need to just seek the kingdom of God well well here it goes right here look it's nice and big and strong yeah well this is this is styrofoam well you said seek the kingdom of God I can see it right there the truth is Ralph Jesus says you can't even see the kingdom unless you're born again well have you been born again I mean I was move your mouth you're freaking me out well by the way I know I need to be born again I was born once and I'm I'm perfect I do good things oh yeah you you were born once but you know what we were born and shaped in sin so Jesus Christ came so that we could accept him in our hearts and be born through him look I know somebody who can help you with this okay show me okay her name is Abuelita Oh sounds like sounds awesome okay so come on let's go me I wanna bet she's really good at explaining hi hi I'm Aleta hi I'm Aleta how are you come on out a little bit more so people could see you there you go oh I'm so fluffy oh don't bite me are you so cute he looks so skinny though just for 10 cents a dog you can for 10 cents a dog for 10 cents a day you can feed the starving dog so I will eat that I was here with my buddy Ralph and we were talking about being born again and he doesn't know how to be or why he needs to be born again yeah yeah can you explain up I believe the thought you know I'm very happy to hear that you're a good boy that you help I will eat us like myself be open our door for us exactly see and you walk us to this chair and you wanna help the Lord I am you want her to the share thank you that's not

again because I want to know about this well I mean you are a good boy and I'm very happy to hear that but let me ask you one question did you steal tell lies well I mean I did but that was a it's okay you got a point there but that was a long time ago okay I haven't told any lies well I did this morning but okay anyways you know keep going well I mean he thought I mean you have to change that and the only way to change that is to be born again okay the Bible tells us Jesus himself told us well I let me tell you I think that reminds me of a song that we sing in my church can I sing for you

Lord takes care of him every single day has fresh water in his bowl and he never lacks any biscuits either that's pretty awesome can anybody else say that you never have lacked water or bread in your home isn't that awesome how faithful God is can we give a great big doggie awesome cuz God is so awesome can everybody say awesome with me so thank you guys for coming I think we explained a little bit we have to be born again okay because jesus said if we're not born again everybody say you can't even see the kingdom of God let's do this all say that together if you're not born again if you're not born again you can't even see you can't even the kingdom of God our kingdom well if you haven't been born again what are you chasing well I mean okay I know I need to be born again but what's the what's the first step in huh thank you for asking oh you're welcome welcome the way you're born again first of all you have to well it sounds kind of scary oh you have to die to yourself die to myself well what do you mean well you did I have to die to myself so yeah but wait you sit hold on but not like that like wait okay you you don't have to really hurt yourself physically bruise on my head look okay what that really means is you have to really look deep inside yourself well do you have a flashlight what are you doing oh you said looking within yourself and now well it didn't really work buddy oh my gosh no no okay you have to go in to pray you know what maybe somebody else could explain it better than me mmm yeah has anybody ever tried ministering to somebody you just stick your foot in their mouth and you're like God give me the right words because I don't know what to say anybody else am I the only one that just messes this up with Ernie yeah I guess I'm the only one that messes this up let's go straight to Jesus Jesus can help us yeah okay are you ready yes oh lord have you been there the whole time yes I have Jesus has been there the whole time Jesus is awesome Jesus is awesome so Lord yeah he doesn't need an introduction you already know all about Ralph right yes I do well I'm trying to figure out how to be born again and you know first she says I need to die to myself and now I have this bruise and then he said look within but then he's like that didn't work out obviously and so we came to you we came to you he said I mean being a born again what is it Jesus I don't even know Oh Ralph Oh Bernie yes sir it's quite simple see I did not make salvation difficult thank God I made a promise to all of my children when I was here on earth and I told them that one day I would leave and I would send the comforter and he would be with them and even in them but they must do a couple of things yes that that is true for one they have to be willing to follow me that's all I'm willing to follow you Jesus are you yes what about you I am I am willing to follow you I am I'm ready yeah he's done everything he is like textbook he can speak in tongues yeah I'm ready to do all that speak in tongues you know I I want but the thing is we're working too hard we need to come back to the basics Lord that's what is it that's correct the basics are that you have to feed on my word see the new birth is not something of the flesh it deals with our spirit see as human beings we were unfortunately well you as humans um yes Lord you mean no thanks for reminding us Lord as human beings you were born with the incorrect spirit yeah and in order to see the kingdom and enter into the kingdom you must go through a process which is called the new birth yes sir it's an experience and you need to seek it every day of your life that's right not just one day not just one experience but every day of your life see you see that tree over there yes sir that is the tree of life I am the bread of life I am the tree of life my Bible is the bread of life you must feed on that and if you love me you will obey it see sometimes I feel like I'm so small I'm so inadequate like there's nothing in me that can ever compare to a tree of life but then I remember your words you said that just like a little mustard seed you said that everything that that tree will ever be was already in that little seed so if we just plant that seed in our heart no matter how small we may think it is well your word can fail so if we keep watering that seed then one day we'll be as strong and as impressive as this beautiful tree right Lord that's right and we have to work together although you see Ernie all the mommies and daddies out there mm-hmm they are responsible for planting those seeds and their children and they must help water and nurture that seed especially the mommies my servant Pastor Bernie always told his people that mommies are like the fifth gospel did you know that yeah did you know that yes mommy so let's give mommy's a round of applause so I think the way Ralph the way we look into ourselves we have to tap into the word which is that the Tree of Life you know and the way we can hear God's voice we have to read and read and and eat that word but we have to pray well that's how God talks to us and that's how you talk to him why do you know how to pray I mean I mean I well my parents never taught me how to pray but maybe you can teach me well well you know I have some friends there are air warriors yeah they're little and the prayers are simple but you know what prayers don't have to be too complicated I think we muddy the waters by complicating things we just got to be short and sweet God knows our heart and the most important thing Ralph look at me there you go right here I have to be sincere you ready to meet these prayer warriors yeah okay come on thank you Lord prayer warriors can we come can you come help us learn how to pray come on let's go we got a knights in shining armor let's go whoa boy whoa whoa your horse here buddy yeah come sit on your horse up here you're gonna teach us how to pray the other way like you ride a horse

light in the tree ruff yeah I I see it there's light in the Tree of Life Wow it illuminates for me and for you yes well now I I think I'm understanding I have to be born again and you know can I pray

offering here an applause for the great job amen hey man I truly enjoyed that amen did you enjoy yourself this evening isn't God wonderful you know the the the the the Word of God is so simple that it applies to us at every stage of our life right and I truly enjoyed that meaning that the same thing that goes for all the little people goes for me I have to be born again to I have to continue to seek God all the time I have to continue to pray and try to read his word and to do everything that they talked about amen amen so I'm gonna give you guys some homework for all of you that are in Sunday school I want you to read John chapter 3 John chapter 3 okay and if you read John chapter 3 and you come to brother Mike next week and you say brother Mike I read John chapter 3 I'm gonna give you something special okay I didn't say what it maybe a handshake and maybe and maybe more homework but it'll be something special okay no no no you guys know brother Mike and I always come through right I always like to give you all those things your parents tell me not to give you eye candy right no no no we'll be okay so god bless you we truly enjoyed and appreciate that she came to support children's church you know it's something that we want to continue to do and we want to continue to just raise our children in God's environment in these difficult times so there was something I do want to mention before we go and you know sister Sharon and and sister Samara came up here and and they talked about bullying a little bit and I want to mention that I want to take the opportunity I want to make sure that all of us here in in our church that we never do that to anybody and and and how that is represented is that we treat somebody that is weaker than us that we mistreat them that we push them or that we kick them or that we touch them or that we do something that is invading their personal space okay so we want to make sure we don't do those things because those aren't the things that the Spirit of God in us does and we hurt people when we do that and that's called bullying how many of you guys have heard of bullying right you can you you can bully somebody physically by grabbing them or you can say bad things that come out of your mouth to hurt somebody just because you think that they're not like you or they're different than you and we shouldn't do that okay first of all because it's not right and it's not Christian like and second of all because it can get you in trouble okay and this goes for little boys big boys and bigger boys so make sure no bullying how many of you are not gonna bully a man raise your hands even you're not gonna believe Rajon there you go all right all right let us all stand so we can just pray if you would but let us pray those power heads Heavenly Father Lord Jesus we come before you this evening Lord we're just so grateful father God we're so grateful Lord because you permit us father to come here and just be together father and to teach your children about your word father about the simplicity of your word Lord about how we have to follow you father through your God through your godly ways Lord Jesus through your plan of salvation Lord Jesus we're just so thankful for that we accepted this evening father and we ask that your will be done in our lives father every step of the way Lord will hold your hand father as you guide us through it Lord Jesus help us Lord help those that aren't here tonight father God Lord we just want to thank you father and we ask you Father to continue to be with our pastor Lord Jesus we're so thankful for him Lord Jesus continue to strengthen him Lord and heal him father and be with sister Lily father God and with all of my brothers and sisters that are part of the Garcia family Lord Jesus we love them Lord and we thank them for their sacrifice father God and we love everybody that was here tonight Lord Jesus may they just go out and may they be an advocate for children's church Lord Jesus that if they see a parent or a child that they know that they may say you know what there's children's church where you can take your children to hear about the Word of God Lord Jesus father we're so grateful for that Lord Jesus we just thank you Father God and we just say we love you Lord and we ask you to be with us in the precious name of our Lord Jesus Christ we
