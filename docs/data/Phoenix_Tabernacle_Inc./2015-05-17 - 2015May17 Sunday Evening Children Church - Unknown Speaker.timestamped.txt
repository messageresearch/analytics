[8:58] off
[9:01] God bless
[9:02] you I come to you in the name of the
[9:05] Lord Jesus
[9:06] Christ and I'd like to welcome you to
[9:08] children's church today we have a
[9:12] another chapter in the life of our
[9:14] Prophet William and Mary and brandham
[9:16] from the book Supernatural the life of
[9:18] William branam this is from book two the
[9:21] young man in his desperation which
[9:22] covers the years 1933 to
[9:25] 1946 uh more
[9:28] importantly every chapter in this series
[9:31] done by our precious brother Oren
[9:33] jurgenson brings with it a
[9:36] lesson this particular chapter is
[9:39] somewhat graphic at times I'll let you
[9:41] know in advance
[9:43] however two things I would like for each
[9:46] and every one of you to take from this
[9:47] chapter and young people as well and
[9:49] young at
[9:50] heart never let your spiritual guard
[9:54] down don't get involved with things that
[9:57] run contrary to the Holy Spirit
[9:59] Spirit as you'll see that will be a
[10:02] theme in this
[10:03] chapter and more
[10:08] importantly you'll notice
[10:10] that later in the chapter there's
[10:13] something that brother Brandon says that
[10:15] makes all the difference I want you to
[10:17] listen closely for
[10:18] that so as we start this is chapter 16
[10:22] the title is like a bat out of hell 1933
[10:26] to
[10:28] 1934
[10:29] the construction on the corner lot of a
[10:31] and Pinn streets was finished in late
[10:34] September of
[10:36] 1933 out of love and respect for their
[10:38] Pastor the congregation voted to call
[10:41] the building brandham Tabernacle it
[10:44] didn't look like a typical Church
[10:46] structure it had no steeple no large
[10:49] cross no sharply pitched roof no vaulted
[10:52] ceiling it was a simple concrete block
[10:54] building with a gently pitched roof a
[10:57] false front and a plain rectangular
[11:00] windows and doors some people in the
[11:02] area joke that it look looked more like
[11:04] a garage or storage shed than a church
[11:07] but to William brandham it looked
[11:09] beautiful he positioned his pulpit in
[11:12] the exact spot where he had been
[11:13] kneeling when the Lord had given him his
[11:16] inspiration to buy this piece of land he
[11:19] placed three crucifixes at the point of
[11:22] the
[11:23] auditorium one on the pulpit one on each
[11:26] side of the wall behind the pulpit just
[11:28] like had seen them positioned in the
[11:31] vision the entire project cost $2,000 to
[11:35] complete with the bank allowing 20 years
[11:37] to pay off the
[11:38] mortgage that was a lot of money for a
[11:41] poor congregation to finance in the
[11:42] middle of the Great Depression to make
[11:45] sure that Brenham Tabernacle could pay
[11:47] its monthly obligations Bill refused to
[11:50] take any of the people's tithes and
[11:52] offerings for his own living expenses
[11:54] preferring instead to plow the money
[11:56] back into the building Bill kept hisob
[11:59] job at Public Service Indiana although
[12:01] he did transfer to another department
[12:03] now he was a lineman in charge of
[12:05] patrolling the high voltage power lines
[12:07] had ran through the wooded Countryside
[12:09] the job Blended so well with his duties
[12:12] as a game warden that he could often do
[12:14] both task at the same time that was
[12:17] fortunate because he still was not
[12:18] earning any money from his work as a
[12:20] game warden one day Bill had kept the
[12:23] construction cost down on the brandham
[12:25] Tabernacle was to leave the floor in
[12:28] dirt when the ground froze outside the
[12:31] floor of the auditorium froze too Bill
[12:34] showed up early for one Wednesday
[12:36] night's service and fired up two cold
[12:38] two coal stoves to take the chill out of
[12:40] the sanctuary before the congregation
[12:43] began to arrive the people walked into
[12:45] the church on frozen ground but by the
[12:48] time the service ended the floor had
[12:50] thawed into a muddy gooey mess
[12:52] grandmothers and granddaughters alike
[12:55] sank up to their ankles as they
[12:56] struggled to get outside although they
[12:59] all had a hearty laugh about it
[13:01] afterwards they also covered the floor
[13:03] with sawdust so it wouldn't happen again
[13:07] Bill embraced his duties as a pastor
[13:09] with the energy of Youth and the Zeal of
[13:11] a young man who had finally discovered
[13:13] his passion besides such expected duties
[13:17] as preaching counseling and praying for
[13:19] the sick he also led to singing paid the
[13:22] debts and cleaned out the ashes of out
[13:24] of the stove whatever came along that
[13:26] needed doing bill volunteered his time
[13:29] being a new pastor on top of being a new
[13:31] Christian filled Bill's days with
[13:33] learning experiences some predictable
[13:35] others quite
[13:37] outlandish coming home one Saturday
[13:39] night in his car Bill's headlights
[13:41] outlined a drunk staggering in the
[13:43] street it turned out to be Wayne bledo a
[13:47] young man who had been a friend of
[13:48] Bill's brother Edward prohibition was
[13:51] still en forced so Bill put Wayne in the
[13:54] car and took the drunk home with him
[13:56] before the man stumbled into the hands
[13:58] of the law
[13:59] he helped Wayne into the house put him
[14:02] in his own bed and then made a place for
[14:04] himself to sleep on the
[14:05] couch Wayne aren't you ashamed of
[14:08] yourself Bill
[14:09] scolded uh Billy uh don't say that Billy
[14:13] drinking is no answer it will kill you
[14:15] before your time what you should do is
[14:18] give your life over to Jesus that will
[14:20] stretch your time into
[14:22] eternity Oh Billy Bill laid his hands on
[14:25] Wayne's forehead I'm going to pray for
[14:27] you Wayne outside a taxi drove up a cab
[14:31] door slammed and Bill heard footsteps
[14:33] running up the sidewalk a woman knocked
[14:35] frantically on the door calling brother
[14:38] Bill brother
[14:39] Bill Bill thought my goodness somebody
[14:41] must be dying he flipped on the lights
[14:45] pulled on his clothes and ran to the
[14:47] door 18-year-old Nelly Sanders stood in
[14:50] the doorway her face pale her eyes red
[14:53] and puffy Nelly come in Nelly Stepped
[14:57] inside Oh Billy I'm gone I'm gone what's
[15:01] the matter Nelly are you having a heart
[15:04] attack no brother Bill I came down from
[15:07] Spring Street and honest brother Bill I
[15:09] didn't mean any harm Bill's mind was
[15:12] spinning wondering how to deal with this
[15:14] hysterical girl now calm down sister
[15:17] tell me about it Nelly was a new
[15:20] Christian herself one of Bill's converts
[15:22] from his tent meetings in June before
[15:25] she gave her heart to Jesus she had been
[15:27] one of the best dancers in town and her
[15:29] dance partner Lee horn still had the
[15:31] trophies to prove it Nelly took a deep
[15:34] breath to quiet her shaking hands she
[15:36] tried to speak slowly and distinctly but
[15:38] her words picked up speed until at the
[15:41] last moment she sounded barely
[15:43] intelligible I was walking by Redmond's
[15:46] Hall and I heard dance music I stopped
[15:48] for a minute to listen the music kept
[15:51] sounding better and better I said Lord
[15:54] you know I love you but I sure can
[15:56] remember times when Lee and I used to
[15:58] win all those trophies and awards maybe
[16:00] if I walk up these steps I'll be able to
[16:03] testify to some of those people so I
[16:06] walked up on the steps and before I knew
[16:09] what I was doing I was out on the dance
[16:10] floor in some boy's arms Oh Billy am I
[16:14] now lost for good I don't want to end up
[16:16] like
[16:17] Margie Billy remembered Margie the girl
[16:20] in the scanny swimming suit who had
[16:22] refused to get out of her road booat
[16:24] when he had asked her to leave the day
[16:26] he was baptizing converts after his
[16:28] Revival meeting when that mysterious
[16:31] star came down from the sky Margie
[16:33] fainted later she started drinking
[16:35] during a barroom brawl someone slashed
[16:37] her in the face with a broken bottle
[16:39] scarring her terribly the last bill it
[16:41] heard she was in an insane
[16:44] institution Nelly was so upset she was
[16:47] shaking Bill tried to console her no
[16:49] sister you're not lost but you did make
[16:52] a mistake when you stopped for a minute
[16:53] to listen to the devil's voice calling
[16:55] you back to what you were before you met
[16:58] Jesus Jesus I haven't been a Christian
[17:00] long but I already know that the
[17:02] greatest battle ever fought is in the
[17:04] human mind it's the battle between faith
[17:06] and doubt are you going to believe God's
[17:09] word or doubt it you have to make your
[17:11] own choice Oh Billy I want to choose
[17:15] faith in Jesus Wayne bledo had sobered a
[17:19] little and was sitting up in in the bed
[17:21] watching curious about the
[17:23] commotion I don't know much about the
[17:25] Bible Bill said but I believe Jesus said
[17:28] this in my name shall they cast out
[17:31] Devils placing his hand on Nelly's
[17:33] shoulder he prayed devil I don't know
[17:36] who you are but this is my sister and
[17:39] you ain't got no business holding her
[17:41] you're going to have to come out of her
[17:42] now you hear me the screen door began to
[17:45] open and close rapidly by itself bangy
[17:48] bangy bangy bang Nelly's eyes widen
[17:52] Billy lookie there what's going on bill
[17:54] was just as surprised I don't know he
[17:57] looked back at Nelly and prayed leave
[17:59] her Satan in Jesus name come out of her
[18:02] as soon as Bill mentioned the name of
[18:04] Jesus a shadowy spectre Rose from behind
[18:06] Nelly Sanders looking like a giant bat
[18:09] with long hair dangling from its wings
[18:11] and feet it growled a guttural RAR and
[18:15] came at Bill who cried out blood of
[18:17] Jesus protect me the demon changed its
[18:20] course and flew Towards the bed where
[18:22] Wayne was sitting it circled once then
[18:24] disappeared into the bed
[18:27] wildeyednorthernboy Wayne yelled tore
[18:29] off his covers and sprinted for the Next
[18:31] Room Bill drove Nelly home when he came
[18:35] back he and his mother took the bed
[18:36] apart and shook the sheets there was
[18:38] nothing
[18:39] there troubled Bill mentioned this
[18:42] incident to several ministers each one
[18:44] of them basically said the same thing
[18:47] Billy brandham the days of casting out
[18:49] devils are over besides a man can't see
[18:51] a demon anyway it must have been your
[18:54] imagination Bill might have have
[18:56] dismissed this as his imag in ination
[18:58] except that both Wayne and Nelly had
[19:00] seen the operation too was this the
[19:03] demon that was plaguing him
[19:05] continually was it following him was it
[19:09] near him all the time was it responsible
[19:12] for all the peculiar happenings in his
[19:14] life including the Visions thoughts like
[19:16] these tormented him constantly making
[19:19] Bill wonder why his life seemed to be so
[19:21] different from the other Christian
[19:23] ministers that he knew God bless

[49:46] said what are you going to do with those
[49:47] socks he said I'm going to I'm not going
[49:50] to be as cold tonight I'll tell you that
[49:51] much and I said I started crying I'm
[49:55] like you can have my socks I gave him my
[49:58] socks he was so happy wow I mean how
[50:02] many of us have more than one pair of
[50:03] socks here right simple things right
[50:07] right simple things and we're so
[50:09] thankful so we should be thankful to God
[50:11] because he gives us everything
[50:14] everything there is nothing that we
[50:15] don't have that he doesn't give us
[50:17] praise God that's right so today we want
[50:20] to talk a little bit Professor about
[50:22] things that we should be doing over the
[50:24] summer right when we have time on our
[50:25] hands oh yes yes you know so I outlined
[50:29] just a simple little schedule here for
[50:31] young Christians and it isn't this
[50:33] doesn't have to be exactly uh the same
[50:35] thing that you're doing but if you look
[50:37] on the paper there what do you think
[50:38] Professor oh I love it what do you think
[50:40] is the first thing we should do when we
[50:42] get up in the morning the first thing we
[50:43] should do is
[50:45] pray right there by your bed if you if
[50:48] you can't if you don't know how to get
[50:49] on your knees next to your bed and
[50:50] you're too tired well pray start praying
[50:53] right there while you hug your pillow
[50:55] you wake up and you're like oh thank God
[50:57] that I have a
[50:59] pillow and I have five more
[51:02] minutes so you just pray to God whatever
[51:04] you can at first and then gradually as
[51:08] you continue practicing how to pray you
[51:11] will get
[51:12] better that's right cuz a lot of people
[51:14] brother Mike they tell me I don't know
[51:16] how to pray and brother brandham even at
[51:18] one point in his life he shared with us
[51:20] that he didn't know how to pray so he
[51:23] wrote God a letter he wrote God a letter
[51:26] and he had a revelation that God lived
[51:29] in the wilderness and in nature so he
[51:31] wrote God a a letter and he put it on a
[51:33] tree wow isn't that special that's
[51:37] pretty awesome huh so if you don't know
[51:38] how to pray I know you all have Facebook
[51:41] so post something right or write a
[51:44] letter if you don't have Facebook good
[51:46] write a letter to God put your heart on
[51:48] paper for him amen so remember start off
[51:52] with the things that you're thankful for
[51:54] oh I'm getting up Professor oh man I'm
[51:56] glad I'm getting up because nothing is
[51:58] for sure that's true some people go to
[52:01] bed and the next morning they don't wake
[52:03] up or they wake up dead well I didn't
[52:05] want to say it like that but yeah
[52:07] Professor oh my bad but it's true you
[52:10] know it's true and we should be thankful
[52:12] you know we should be thankful that we
[52:14] get up and we're in our comfortable bed
[52:16] with our cover and that our mommy and
[52:18] our daddy are there and that they're
[52:20] providing all these good things and then
[52:22] we should think about all the people
[52:23] that we love oh my grandparents my
[52:27] aunties my uncles you know my cousin
[52:29] that kind that kind of cousin that I
[52:31] don't really like but I'll pray for him
[52:32] anyways and hope that the Lord changes
[52:35] him you know one of those yeah pray for
[52:37] the people maybe that you don't like you
[52:39] know that kid that picks on you at
[52:40] school and that always makes fun of you
[52:42] or something say Lord help him Lord show
[52:44] him that I'm not a bad person yeah and
[52:48] the Lord will listen to you and he'll
[52:49] say oh look he'll tell the angels look
[52:52] look at my child the first thing she
[52:54] does when she gets up in the morning
[52:55] that she prays he prays and it's not
[52:58] like a it's not like a funny thing it's
[53:00] for real the Lord will listen to you
[53:03] brother brandham tells us and the
[53:05] scripture says that if we pray to him he
[53:08] will listen your prayers won't fall on
[53:11] deaf years all right so remember that so
[53:14] mommies and daddies how would you feel
[53:16] if your kids woke up they ate the
[53:18] breakfast you made them they put on the
[53:20] clothes that you bought them they get in
[53:22] the car that you pay the bills for and
[53:24] you dropped them off at the school that
[53:26] you enroll them in and then you pick
[53:28] them up but they never say a word to you
[53:30] wow how would you feel mommies and
[53:32] daddies if you're like good night little
[53:35] girls and they're
[53:36] [Music]
[53:39] like good morning little boys and
[53:41] they're
[53:43] like and they never say a word to you
[53:46] little boys and girls would that be
[53:48] nice s's like no see prayer to Professor
[53:52] in the morning it helps it helps set the
[53:55] tone for the day exactly and what I mean
[53:58] by that is it it'll determine if you're
[54:00] going to be in a good mood or if you're
[54:02] going to be in a grouchy mood but the
[54:05] next thing we do you know we got to pray
[54:07] but then the next thing let's talk about
[54:08] hygiene a little bit right hygiene is
[54:11] how you take care of yourself so we have
[54:13] to go in and wash our face or take a
[54:14] shower depending on you know on on on on
[54:17] what we do and then we got to brush our
[54:19] teeth right really good until I think
[54:21] you need to repeat that one brush your
[54:24] teeth that's right brush our teeth and
[54:27] then brush your hair right and now with
[54:29] the same brush right it's a you don't
[54:32] want to do your toothbrush and then
[54:33] brush your hair with your toothbrush
[54:34] right cuz then it may get a little furry
[54:36] and you may not be able to use it again
[54:38] right I'm not going to preach brush your
[54:39] hair cuz then I'd be a hypocrite yes
[54:42] sir we'll have to take him to the barber
[54:44] shop I'm sure he knows a few
[54:47] Barbers so see you see the kids are
[54:49] right they're brushing their hair and
[54:50] they're combing their teeth but then
[54:51] there's the opposite Professor brushing
[54:53] their hair combing their teeth well the
[54:55] other way I'm sorry there's the opposite
[54:58] there's the opposite see can somebody
[55:00] tell me what he forgot to do Professor
[55:03] what do you think this guy right here
[55:05] the young man what did he forget to do
[55:06] with the white shirt yeah he forgot to
[55:08] pray look that's right he looks pretty
[55:10] mean right he need a hug and the young
[55:13] lady over there what do you think she
[55:14] forgot to do comb her hair and uh does
[55:20] that person brush their teeth we got to
[55:23] brush our teeth we got to take care
[55:24] because God gave us her teeth I think he
[55:26] she was brushing her hair and combing
[55:28] her teeth I think so I think so okay so
[55:32] remember there's the opposite right and
[55:36] if some if you're angry and you don't
[55:38] comb your hair and you have bad teeth
[55:39] you think people are going to like look
[55:41] at you and say that's a good citizen
[55:43] that's a Christian wow no you're going
[55:46] to attract attention for all the wrong
[55:49] reasons right okay so let's go to the
[55:52] next
[55:54] slide
[55:57] we'll we'll ask brother Christian if he
[55:58] can go to the next slide there you go so
[56:02] this remember this is just a so now
[56:04] we've prayed now we've done our hygiene
[56:06] now we go to the TA you know we go to
[56:08] the breakfast table and we have to eat
[56:10] good for our body and for our soul amen
[56:14] amen because our body is our Temple
[56:16] brother Mike oh did you guys know that
[56:19] one that your body is the Temple of the
[56:21] Lord amen so you got to take care of it
[56:24] you know I know brother Al with the
[56:25] older class today uh in Sunday school he
[56:28] was talking about the Holy Ghost the
[56:31] dove right is that right Judah he was
[56:33] talking about the Holy Ghost right and
[56:36] that Dove comes into the temple that
[56:37] Professor Theo is talking about but if
[56:39] the temple isn't ready to receive him is
[56:42] that Dove going to stay there or is it
[56:44] going to fly away fly away it'll fly
[56:47] away so we have to take care of our
[56:49] Temple so how do we do that well we got
[56:52] to pray for the food and eat breakfast
[56:54] right Professor yes sir and eat lots of
[56:57] good food healthy stuff mhm right we got
[57:00] to take it easy on the sugar cuz if not
[57:02] we'll be bouncing all over the house
[57:04] right or we're or if we go to school man
[57:07] they won't be able to control Us in
[57:09] school right the teacher will call home
[57:11] and say hey you got to tone the sugar
[57:13] down a little bit on the
[57:16] kids you like sugar
[57:19] Professor yes yeah the professor likes
[57:21] sugar right but my wife limits my sugar
[57:23] intake oh she makes me eat broccoli
[57:26] which is good for you so we pray for our
[57:29] food and remember after the food after
[57:32] so if our mom gives us healthy
[57:35] food and we like all that yummy stuff
[57:37] for breakfast but maybe there's you know
[57:39] maybe we want something else besides
[57:41] healthy food and we don't really like
[57:43] the healthy food and we don't get what
[57:45] we want but we've already prayed for it
[57:47] that food is
[57:50] blessed so you know when your mom goes
[57:52] into the other room you can't run to the
[57:54] trash can and throw away the food oh
[57:57] right no because the food's blessed and
[58:00] it's blessed by God and he gives it to
[58:01] you so why would we throw anything in
[58:03] the trash or not eat it we got to eat it
[58:06] all up trust me the stuff you don't like
[58:08] you begin to like as you're older for
[58:11] one reason or another okay all
[58:14] right so remember we're talking about
[58:17] the summer okay so now we've gotten up
[58:20] Professor we've prayed we've combed our
[58:22] hair we've done what we needed to do
[58:25] we've eaten
[58:26] breakfast maybe our mom asked us to do
[58:28] some chores or our daddy asks us to do
[58:30] some chores pick up your room put away
[58:32] your shoes you know feed the pet the dog
[58:35] the Goldfish the cat whatever you have
[58:38] do something around the
[58:40] house then maybe it's time to take a
[58:42] little
[58:43] time after breakfast and after your
[58:46] chores and read God's
[58:48] word just a little time putting God
[58:51] first right and this is good for all of
[58:53] us it's not just good for children as
[58:56] adults we need to do these things right
[58:58] we need to we need to prioritize I was
[59:01] talking with with our associate pastor
[59:03] in the back brother Johnny and we were
[59:05] talking about priorities you know that
[59:07] Professor we were talking about about
[59:10] how um God has to be our priority does
[59:14] everybody know what priority means yeah
[59:16] help us Professor do you guys children
[59:18] raise your hand if you don't know what
[59:19] priority
[59:20] means it's okay don't be shy it's okay
[59:23] okay well I'm going to say
[59:25] in thank priority means things in order
[59:28] of importance so things that are
[59:31] important what should be important for
[59:34] example is hitting your brother a
[59:39] priority no it's not is stealing your
[59:43] sister's cookies a
[59:45] priority no is brushing your teeth a
[59:50] priority okay but what is more of a
[59:53] priority brushing in your teeth or
[59:55] praying to
[59:57] Jesus ah so you got to put things in
[1:00:01] order of importance so when you wake up
[1:00:03] what's the most important thing pray
[1:00:06] Lord praying to the Lord and then the
[1:00:07] next important thing maybe you make your
[1:00:09] bed and then brush your teeth you could
[1:00:11] talk to your mommy and daddy and write a
[1:00:13] list of priorities for this summer yeah
[1:00:15] you know but the thing you shouldn't do
[1:00:16] is say oh Mom I didn't brush my teeth
[1:00:18] because I had to
[1:00:19] pray right because then you end up like
[1:00:22] uh the picture right over there so
[1:00:25] remember it isn't excuses because
[1:00:28] there's a lot of excuses we just have
[1:00:30] to have our priorities things in order
[1:00:35] so let's see let's see what else we have
[1:00:37] here Professor so after we read a little
[1:00:40] bit of God's word or we can sit down and
[1:00:41] say mommy can you tell me a little bit
[1:00:43] about God's word Daddy can you tell me a
[1:00:45] little bit about God's word or talk with
[1:00:47] your brother and sister and talk about
[1:00:49] maybe what you learned in Sunday school
[1:00:50] or something you heard in church it's
[1:00:53] good to talk about God's word because
[1:00:55] then we keep it as a priority in our
[1:00:58] lives and then we're focused on the
[1:01:00] wrong things you can have bad
[1:01:03] conversations Professor like so if I'm
[1:01:06] the professor's older brother and maybe
[1:01:08] I don't like to do things that are right
[1:01:11] and I don't want to talk about the Lord
[1:01:12] with them maybe I come to him and I say
[1:01:14] Professor my
[1:01:16] brother you know when Mom and Dad went
[1:01:18] home I turned on the TV and I watched
[1:01:22] that program I shouldn't have watched on
[1:01:23] the Disney Channel uhuh yeah man and I
[1:01:26] really like the way they were dancing oh
[1:01:29] now is that is that something that's
[1:01:31] going to bring me good
[1:01:34] things instead the professor would tell
[1:01:37] me brother Mike we just sit down and
[1:01:40] talk about how Jonah took a message of
[1:01:44] God to
[1:01:45] Nineveh he was swallowed by a whale was
[1:01:48] not
[1:01:49] yeah then God took him see for example
[1:01:52] you could talk about any story in the
[1:01:53] Bible or David the little kid how he
[1:01:56] beat up a Goliath giant oh yeah that big
[1:01:58] giant that was like 9 feet tall right
[1:02:00] see and then you can
[1:02:02] change you can change what you and your
[1:02:05] brother and your sister are talking
[1:02:06] about into a good
[1:02:08] conversation right and we're going to
[1:02:10] learn about that right now so after that
[1:02:13] we have to get some exercise exercise is
[1:02:16] good right how many like
[1:02:18] exercise right yeah that's right walking
[1:02:21] walking is good exercise yes it is you
[1:02:24] know cleaning your room is good exercise
[1:02:26] riding your
[1:02:27] bike lifting weights lifting weights not
[1:02:31] lifting the remote that's
[1:02:34] right we should really limit limit TV
[1:02:39] right TV not only don't they have good
[1:02:42] things to watch unfortunately but um
[1:02:46] it's not healthy to sit in front of the
[1:02:47] TV for hours and hours and hours and
[1:02:49] hours eating Cheetos yeah eating Cheetos
[1:02:53] or even video games I mean I know some
[1:02:55] video games are fun and then some of
[1:02:57] them are just not even appropriate
[1:02:59] appropriate means good yeah they're not
[1:03:03] good for you they do things to your to
[1:03:06] your mind right we want to keep our
[1:03:09] Temple ready for the little duve right
[1:03:13] the Holy Spirit the Holy Spirit the very
[1:03:17] life of God God's life in us doing the
[1:03:22] things that he did through US brother
[1:03:24] Jeff talked
[1:03:25] about This Little Light of
[1:03:28] Mine can you show us your light can I
[1:03:31] see your light give me oil in my lamp
[1:03:34] and you guys saw the drama too right
[1:03:36] where we need to keep refilling our
[1:03:38] lamps so it all plays good together I
[1:03:41] didn't say that it's you shouldn't watch
[1:03:44] any TV but you should really talk to
[1:03:46] your mommy and daddy about what is good
[1:03:49] for you to watch and what is not good
[1:03:51] for you to watch and watch the time you
[1:03:54] spend on video games because you could
[1:03:57] be out exercising you could be reading
[1:03:59] did you know that your mind is like a
[1:04:01] muscle Professor oh yeah and the more
[1:04:03] that you read the stronger it gets the
[1:04:05] stronger it gets
[1:04:08] yeah watching TV doesn't really exercise
[1:04:11] your mind I don't think
[1:04:14] so okay let's go to the next side
[1:04:16] brother
[1:04:17] Christian so again there's also another
[1:04:21] type of exercise professor and that's
[1:04:23] exercise in your spirit oh that sounds
[1:04:25] good can you read those for me Professor
[1:04:28] yes yes yes exercise your spirit number
[1:04:31] one testify about God's goodness in your
[1:04:34] life that's why we like to practice
[1:04:37] saying God is
[1:04:39] good and all the
[1:04:42] time
[1:04:44] yes I bet you if each one of you if if I
[1:04:47] ask each one of you which I want to
[1:04:49] stand and tell me about God's goodness
[1:04:51] in your life you would probably have
[1:04:53] more than 10 things to tell me each of
[1:04:55] you yeah sometimes we just do what is
[1:04:59] called take it for
[1:05:01] granted where they just oh things happen
[1:05:04] oh you know I have food I have shoes I
[1:05:07] have shelter I have this I have that and
[1:05:10] you're just like yeah I want more yeah I
[1:05:13] want more but we have to be
[1:05:15] thankful for what we have amen and take
[1:05:19] care of what we have right right what's
[1:05:22] the next one Professor confess to others
[1:05:25] what you believe oh but sometimes kids
[1:05:29] can be embarrassed cuz we don't know how
[1:05:30] they're going to make fun of us but did
[1:05:33] they make fun of Jesus Professor yes and
[1:05:36] why did Jesus do what he did Professor
[1:05:38] because he loved us that's right could
[1:05:41] you imagine that he suffered being
[1:05:44] innocent he suffered for you and for me
[1:05:49] mhm and he and he and he said that I
[1:05:53] have to do what I have have to
[1:05:54] do so we should confess it did you know
[1:05:57] that as we confess it Professor it gets
[1:06:00] easier and easier and easier amen do you
[1:06:04] know that when you meet people the first
[1:06:05] thing that you should do to to to tell
[1:06:08] them who you are is God bless you and
[1:06:12] that's like wow okay I felt chills you
[1:06:15] know people don't know how to sometimes
[1:06:17] people don't know how to react to that
[1:06:18] oh oh okay thank
[1:06:21] you but they know that something special
[1:06:23] about
[1:06:24] but or you can say hey bro what's up man
[1:06:27] what's
[1:06:28] shaking you know that's kind of like way
[1:06:30] back in time right but you guys get the
[1:06:32] picture who knows what you guys do in
[1:06:33] school now right Joseph Joseph what's up
[1:06:36] bro one thing that gives me strength is
[1:06:39] that the scripture says blessed are
[1:06:41] those that are made fun of for my name's
[1:06:44] sake remember that that's right
[1:06:46] scripture says that profess so you're
[1:06:48] blessed if they laugh at you or tease
[1:06:50] you cuz you're a Christian that just
[1:06:52] means you're blessed so instead instead
[1:06:54] of saying they making fun of me they
[1:06:56] want to know how come I have to wear
[1:06:58] this skirt why do I have to keep my hair
[1:06:59] so long like how come I don't cuss dad
[1:07:02] had to how no instead of thinking that
[1:07:04] they're all making fun of you you should
[1:07:06] say you know what they're making fun of
[1:07:07] me which means I'm blessed
[1:07:11] right that's right so they make fun you
[1:07:13] say h I'm blessed and you're not no and
[1:07:15] there's
[1:07:16] nothing don't say that and did you know
[1:07:20] did you know that we have something
[1:07:21] that's called freedom of speech here in
[1:07:23] the United States right and you can say
[1:07:26] whatever you want you could say I am a
[1:07:28] Christian amen and I believe in Jesus
[1:07:30] Christ and I love him right yes amen
[1:07:34] there's nothing wrong with that you know
[1:07:37] what it wasn't always like that for
[1:07:39] brother
[1:07:41] Mike oo yeah it wasn't always like that
[1:07:43] but now you know where I work every day
[1:07:46] I go there and everybody knows that I'm
[1:07:48] a Christian everybody knows the things
[1:07:50] that I do and the things that I don't do
[1:07:52] wow and everybody knows that I'm not
[1:07:54] perfect either right but when I sit down
[1:07:57] when I go to lunch with
[1:07:58] people they they they give me time so I
[1:08:01] can pray for my food and if I'm and if
[1:08:03] I'm there with other Christians
[1:08:05] Professor with maybe other Christians
[1:08:07] that don't come to church here we we'll
[1:08:09] all pray together for our food nice yeah
[1:08:12] so there's remember if you practice
[1:08:14] things while you're young it's going to
[1:08:16] be that much more easier as you get
[1:08:17] older and don't be embarrassed of it cuz
[1:08:19] that would be like being embarrassed of
[1:08:21] who you are that's right like you don't
[1:08:23] want to walk around like I hope nobody
[1:08:24] knows that I'm a boy I hope nobody knows
[1:08:27] that I'm
[1:08:29] Mexico I you don't want to be
[1:08:31] embarrassed of who you are just like you
[1:08:33] don't want to be embarrassed of being a
[1:08:34] Christian right so when you sit in the
[1:08:36] cafeteria at school no more doing
[1:08:39] this thank you Lord for my food
[1:08:42] amen just close your eyes and be like
[1:08:45] thank you Lord for this food and please
[1:08:48] don't let me get food poisoning Lord
[1:08:50] Lord thank you for making it blah blah
[1:08:53] blah aen am men you know what I mean
[1:08:55] that's
[1:08:56] right encourage others to do good
[1:08:58] professor exactly when you stand up and
[1:09:02] and you're proud of your beliefs and
[1:09:05] your faith in God that empowers other
[1:09:08] people to do the same and it encourages
[1:09:11] them so just by you being who you are
[1:09:14] Judah being a nice Christian Soldier
[1:09:16] you're empowering and giving other
[1:09:18] people strength to be the same could you
[1:09:21] imagine if I came over here to Judah and
[1:09:22] said hey Judah
[1:09:24] let's go outside and grab some rocks and
[1:09:25] throw them at Professor Theo
[1:09:27] spaceship and Judah said uh brother Mike

[1:09:33] my spaceship gots Insurance you know
[1:09:36] well damaging other people's property
[1:09:39] can get you in trouble if Jud have told
[1:09:41] me that could you imagine that you can
[1:09:42] get in trouble brother Mike the police
[1:09:44] can come get you MH oh Jude I did thanks
[1:09:48] man I really appreciate you saving me
[1:09:50] man encourage others to do good in
[1:09:52] school when when others encourage you to
[1:09:54] do bad things you encourage them to do
[1:09:57] good no we're not supposed to disrespect
[1:09:59] the teacher
[1:10:00] because she's a teacher she is a figure
[1:10:03] of authority and she sacrifices to come
[1:10:06] and teach us and and it's a benefit to
[1:10:10] us it's a good to us so we should
[1:10:12] respect everybody right yeah see these
[1:10:15] are all different ways to exercise your
[1:10:18] spirit the spirit that God has given you
[1:10:21] right to be a to a healthy Christian
[1:10:24] right you want to be a healthy citizen
[1:10:27] you also want to be a healthy Christian
[1:10:30] what does Romans 10:9 say Romans 10:9
[1:10:33] says that if you confess with your mouth
[1:10:37] Jesus as Lord and believe in your heart
[1:10:41] that God raised him from the dead you
[1:10:44] will be saved oh
[1:10:48] man so if I confess Jesus You're My Lord
[1:10:53] uh-huh I will be saved uh-huh oh man we
[1:10:57] should confess then let's do that right
[1:10:59] now let's do it Professor can anybody
[1:11:01] else want to confess that with us can
[1:11:03] you repeat after us we're going to say
[1:11:05] Jesus You're My Lord can we say
[1:11:10] that everybody together count of three 1
[1:11:13] 2 3es Jesus You're My Lord king of my
[1:11:18] heart and king of my heart heart amen
[1:11:22] now now it says all they have to do is
[1:11:24] believe in their heart that God raised
[1:11:27] him from the dead who believes that
[1:11:29] Jesus rose from the
[1:11:31] dead woohoo then we can be saved I'm
[1:11:35] going to say this for for for our folks
[1:11:37] that speak Spanish Professor
[1:11:52] okay
[1:12:09] praise the Lord amen what does Matthew
[1:12:11] 10:32 say professor Matthew
[1:12:15] 10:32 therefore everyone who confesses
[1:12:18] me before men I will also confess him
[1:12:22] before my my father who is in
[1:12:26] heaven
[1:12:27] amen I love that one so that means I if
[1:12:31] we tell people you know what I'm a
[1:12:32] Christian I love Jesus he's my Lord I'm
[1:12:35] going to follow him that when we get to
[1:12:37] heaven one day Jesus will tell his
[1:12:41] father you know what brother Mike stood
[1:12:43] for me on that day and he loved me and
[1:12:46] he was proud of me so I'm gonna stand
[1:12:49] for him brother Mike I love him can I go
[1:12:51] with Jesus now you can come wow it won't
[1:12:55] that be great or would you rather get
[1:12:58] father he he had the opportunity to
[1:13:00] confess me but he didn't confess
[1:13:06] me can I go with Jesus then
[1:13:10] oh which one would we choose
[1:13:14] right I choose to confess Jesus right
[1:13:17] mhm doesn't mean we have to be perfect
[1:13:20] oh we can't be perfect but that's what
[1:13:22] for amen you
[1:13:25] know there was a story about the Apostle
[1:13:29] Paul I've been talking to Bernie about
[1:13:31] this professor Paul and Silas and they
[1:13:34] were in
[1:13:35] prison and as they began to Worship in
[1:13:39] prison the spirit of the Lord came down
[1:13:41] and shook the
[1:13:43] prison and it shook the prison apart and
[1:13:46] the guard was so nervous because he
[1:13:48] thought they were going to get
[1:13:49] away and you know in those days the
[1:13:52] Centurion would have to pay with his
[1:13:54] life for those prisoners so the
[1:13:57] Centurion brother Braham says that he
[1:13:58] took out his sword and was going to
[1:14:00] commit
[1:14:02] suicide and Paul said harm yourself
[1:14:06] not for we are all
[1:14:09] here and and the Centurion said man
[1:14:12] there's something special about these
[1:14:14] two what's so special and it was so
[1:14:19] overwhelming that they said that the
[1:14:21] Centurion being an unbeliever asked them
[1:14:24] what must I do to be
[1:14:27] saved and Paul said believe in Jesus
[1:14:32] Christ all we have to do is believe amen
[1:14:35] confess
[1:14:36] him so do you guys got a good idea now
