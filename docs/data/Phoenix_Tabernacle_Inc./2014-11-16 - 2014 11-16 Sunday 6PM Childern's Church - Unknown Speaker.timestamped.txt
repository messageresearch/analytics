[19:10] anything that touches my heart like that

[19:15] exert for you tonight in the second book

[19:19] Brandon which we just started with the
[19:21] last exert and the the chapters un
[19:24] numbered
[19:26] sequentially this particular chapter has
[19:29] a title which I will not give it this
[19:30] time only
[19:32] because I want this to be
[19:34] [Music]
[19:35] received in such a manner that it
[19:39] would should the Lord permit it would
[19:41] touch your
[19:43] heart I think it speaks for itself
[19:46] pardon the phrase but tonight I ask you
[19:48] to put your spiritual seat belts on as
[19:51] we are so honored and privileged to go
[19:53] into another part of her life of our
[19:55] Prophet William Aaron brandham chapter
[19:59] 13
[20:15] 1933 it was June 11th
[20:18] 1933 by 2:00 in the afternoon a thousand
[20:22] people gathered on the banks of the Ohio
[20:24] river at the end of Spring Street to
[20:26] watch these baptisms the Earth baked
[20:29] under cloudless Sky not even the
[20:32] slightest Breeze moved to cool the crowd
[20:34] as they
[20:35] sang on Jordan's stormy Banks I stand
[20:38] and cast a Wishful eye toward canaan's
[20:41] fair and Happy Land where my possessions
[20:44] lie I am Bound for the promised
[20:47] land when Billy reached the shoreline he
[20:50] saw a young woman he knew named Margie
[20:53] sitting in a rowboat close to the spot
[20:55] where the baptisms needed to be Margie
[20:58] was scantly dressed in a bathing suit
[21:00] feeling that Margie's bathing suit was
[21:02] indecent and inappropriate Billy asked
[21:05] her politely if she would
[21:06] leave she answered indignantly I don't
[21:10] have to
[21:11] leave that's right Margie you don't have
[21:13] to but if I were you I'd have enough
[21:16] respect for the gospel to leave where
[21:19] I'm baptizing don't talk to me about
[21:22] respecting the gospel I'm a Sunday
[21:24] school teacher I don't believe in
[21:26] baptizing and I don't have to leave
[21:29] Margie snickered as Billy turned away
[21:32] Billy waited into the river along with
[21:34] the first candidate for baptism the two
[21:37] stood waste Deep in water while the
[21:39] current moved sluggishly around them the
[21:42] surface of the river was so smooth it
[21:44] looked like molten glass Under The Naked
[21:47] Sun heat waves blurred the trees on the
[21:49] opposite Shore Bill asked do you believe
[21:53] you have met Jesus Christ at this
[21:56] revival the man answered
[21:58] yes have you repented of your sins yes
[22:03] do you believe Jesus Christ has forgiven
[22:05] you and that now you are saved from your
[22:07] sins yes then let us pray together they
[22:12] bowed their heads Bill prayed Heavenly
[22:15] Father we are here because you have
[22:17] ordained us to go into all nations
[22:19] making disciples out of them baptizing
[22:22] them in the name of the father and of
[22:24] the son and of the Holy Ghost amen then
[22:27] bu raised his head turned to the
[22:29] candidate and said upon the confession
[22:32] of your sin I baptize you my beloved
[22:34] brother in the name of our Lord Jesus
[22:36] Christ the candidate held his nose as
[22:39] Bill dipped him back into the turbid
[22:42] waters while the first baptized person
[22:45] waited toward Shore and the second
[22:47] candidate waited out Bill exhorted a
[22:50] crowd why did Jesus tell us to be
[22:53] baptized well for one thing it is
[22:55] symbolic of death death to the world
[22:57] World symbolically the old man is going
[23:01] into the grave so that the new man can
[23:03] come forth and live a new life in Jesus
[23:06] Christ but remember baptism baptism does
[23:10] not change you it's only the outward
[23:12] sign of an inward work the believer is
[23:14] witnessing to the world that Jesus
[23:16] Christ has already changed him
[23:18] inside one by one bill baptized the
[23:21] candidates in similar fashion the 17th
[23:24] person to wait into the river was Edward
[23:26] koven a boy not too much younger than
[23:29] Bill himself as the two stood waste deep
[23:32] in the current bill asked Edward do you
[23:35] believe you were regenerated at the
[23:37] Revival meetings yes the boy answered
[23:40] Bill raised his voice to reach the crowd
[23:42] on the shore everyone bow your heads
[23:46] when they complied Bill closed his own
[23:49] eyes and bowed his head and prayed aloud
[23:52] heavenly father just when he heard a
[23:54] voice say look up he opened his eyes and
[23:58] looked at Edward who was waiting
[23:59] patiently with his head bowed and his
[24:02] eyes closed the words had not come from
[24:04] him Bill did not know where they came
[24:07] from puzzled he again bowed his head
[24:10] closed his eyes and continued his
[24:13] prayer heavenly father as I baptize this
[24:16] boy with water you baptize him with the
[24:19] Holy Spirit again he heard a voice say
[24:22] look up opening his eyes he looked
[24:26] around Edward opened his eyes too
[24:29] curious of the
[24:30] delay well brother Bill did you hear
[24:33] that hear what for the third time Bill
[24:37] Heard a Voice say look up this time he
[24:41] looked into the sky and gasped dropping
[24:44] out of the heavens came a fireball from
[24:46] the distance it resembled a star
[24:49] oscillating between yellowish green and
[24:51] Amber as it fell closer it looked like a
[24:54] Milling circle of fire roaring spinning
[24:56] throwing off Sparks and Flames Bill held
[24:59] his breath in Terror as the star came
[25:01] right at him but it stopped short and
[25:03] hung directly overhead the waters around
[25:06] Bill churned sending up a fine Mist that
[25:09] refracted a little Rainbow over the star
[25:12] suddenly Bill heard a voice speaking to
[25:14] him it was not the melodious Bas voice
[25:17] that so often spoke to him in Visions
[25:20] this voice was tenor familiar it said as
[25:24] John the Baptist was sent to forerun the
[25:27] first coming of Jesus Christ so are you
[25:30] sent with a message to forerun his
[25:32] second coming on the River Bank the
[25:35] people still had their heads bowed in
[25:37] prayer but Margie was watching from her
[25:39] rowboat when she saw the light she
[25:42] screamed hysterically before She fainted
[25:44] pitching forward into the bow of the
[25:46] boat that scream jerked up heads in
[25:50] seconds pandemonium broke loose as the
[25:52] crowd looked up to see a swirling ball
[25:54] of fire hanging above Billy bram's head
[25:57] when women screamed men grabbed one
[25:59] another some panicked and ran a few
[26:01] fainted most just
[26:04] trembled not everyone who saw the star
[26:06] heard the voice but one particular
[26:09] 14-year-old girl heard it she had kept
[26:12] her eyes closed and her head bowed even
[26:14] during the crowd's frenzy because her
[26:17] pastor had told her to Bow her head and
[26:19] she tried to always do what her Pastor
[26:22] said this girl did hear the voice heard
[26:25] every word distinctly and because she
[26:29] heard something powerful sank deep into
[26:31] her soul as though an anchor had buried
[26:34] itself in the accumulated silt of her
[26:37] experience her name was ma Bry and she
[26:41] was destined to play an important role
[26:43] in Bill's
[26:44] future the ball of fire hung above
[26:47] Bill's head for less than a minute then
[26:49] it shot back into the heavens from where
[26:51] it came the choppy water smooth again
[26:54] under a windless Blue Sky Billy spoke to
[26:57] the the crowd until they all calmed down
[27:00] then he continued baptizing until he
[27:01] finished immersing all 200 candidates in
[27:05] the name of the Lord Jesus Christ as he
[27:08] sosed to the shore a group of
[27:10] Jeffersonville businessmen surrounded
[27:11] him and asked anxiously what did that
[27:14] light
[27:15] mean Bill answered honestly I don't know
[27:19] I am a
[27:20] believer it might have been a sign for
[27:22] the unbeliever I can't tell
[27:25] you the next morning the local newspaper
[27:28] ran an article about this incident
[27:31] caption quote unquote mysterious star
[27:34] appears over Minister while
[27:36] baptizing for everyone else it was just
[27:38] another curious bit of news to talk
[27:40] about on the day the paper came out but
[27:43] to William brandham it was much more he
[27:46] had stood beneath that pulsing amber
[27:48] light and squinted from its brightness
[27:51] he had seen the waters turn choppy
[27:53] around him he had heard clearly that
[27:56] voice declared
[27:58] as John the Baptist was sent to forun
[28:00] the first coming of Jesus Christ so are
[28:03] you sent with a message to forun his
[28:06] second coming no this was not something
[28:09] to be dismissed lightly and because it
[28:11] seemed so outlandish and difficult to
[28:14] understand Bill considered it a
[28:16] supernatural sign that demanded an
[28:19] explanation and if this sign did come
[28:22] from God then he believed the
[28:25] explanation of it would have to come out
[28:27] of the pages of God's word with fervor
[28:30] Bill read his Bible searching for Clues
[28:34] he kept a notebook and pencil nearby so
[28:36] he could jot down whichever scriptures
[28:38] seemed to apply to his surprise he
[28:42] discovered many God bless

[42:40] worry sometimes we don't even think
[42:42] about
[42:44] things but we're still
[42:47] worried because in the back of our
[42:51] minds there's things that are processing
[42:54] all the
[42:55] time
[42:57] and and and and and and you know
[42:59] something that's very common
[43:02] today is to see young
[43:05] people that have gray
[43:08] hair or they start getting gray
[43:11] hair it's just too stressful
[43:16] nowadays you know we have to worry about
[43:20] this about

[44:06] bothers
[44:10] you that stresses you

[44:29] it raise your hand if you
[44:33] would well do you know that we have
[44:37] somebody that's very very very
[44:42] special that's better than a
[44:46] superhero that died for
[44:50] us and that took the victory for
[44:54] us and we can give him all of these
[44:58] things now the children are pretty

[45:22] bit about trusting in God
[45:27] putting our trust in
[45:31] God trusting Jesus for our
[45:36] lives you know all through the
[45:41] Bible Jesus tells
[45:44] us how to be very very
[45:49] successful through our
[45:52] lives he gives us all of the secrets
[45:57] all of the
[46:00] superpowers in his
[46:02] word did you know that that's right
[46:06] that's why he left it for
[46:08] us you know when
[46:11] Jesus when the devil and I think the
[46:14] devil was back there somewhere roaming
[46:17] around back there
[46:20] Jesus he was back there roaming
[46:23] around and when the devil came to
[46:27] Jesus and he tried to tempt
[46:31] Jesus yeah he tried to tempt
[46:35] Jesus
[46:37] Jesus used the
[46:39] word against
[46:41] him and eventually he told
[46:44] them get behind me

[52:38] like brother
[52:40] Mike of course brother
[52:42] Mike thank you
[52:44] Jesus Jesus you guys want to ask him a
[52:48] question does anybody want to ask Jesus
[52:50] a
[52:51] question no no
[52:54] anybody okay we'll we we we'll save the
[52:57] questions for later Jesus thank
[53:03] you so he is our
[53:07] hope man you ever have hope about
[53:09] something inside your
[53:13] heart and you say man I hope that
[53:17] happens oh man I hope my mom and dad do
[53:22] that oh I hope something comes oh
[53:26] something good and I hope that that
[53:29] situation at
[53:31] school you know that boy that's always
[53:34] hitting me in the
[53:36] arm or those kids that are always making
[53:39] fun of
[53:41] me oh I have
[53:43] hope but we want to put our hope in
[53:48] Jesus and how do we put our hope in
[53:52] him by putting all of of those things
[53:56] that we hope
[54:00] for and saying
[54:03] Jesus we can take him by the
[54:05] hand just like
[54:07] that and say
[54:10] Lord I put all of these things into your
[54:15] hands oh and I I'm just hoping and
[54:18] trusting for the best
[54:23] Lord that's right
[54:27] praise the
[54:29] Lord and he he he will come if you pray
[54:32] to
[54:33] him if you get on your
[54:36] knees in your
[54:38] room in a in a private
[54:41] place and you say
[54:43] Lord
[54:45] Lord he comes
[54:48] down as a peaceful
[54:52] spirit and then you can feel him
[54:56] and then you can ask
[54:58] him and then you're just
[55:03] like I can
[55:06] rest there's nothing he can't
[55:09] do thank you
[55:13] Jesus so let's see what else he has for
[55:16] us so since our
[55:19] youth are you are you young how many
[55:23] young people do I have in here tonight
[55:25] amen see everybody is amen Lord all
[55:29] right next
[55:31] one Judah you want to help us read that
[55:34] come on
[55:36] up commit thy way unto the Lord trust
[55:40] also in him and he shall bring it to
[55:47] pass so if we trust and believe in
[55:51] him don't trust and believe in brother
[55:54] Mike
[55:57] but if you trust and believe in the
[56:02] Lord and if it's something that's good
[56:05] for
[56:07] you to make you a strong
[56:11] Christian or something that you
[56:14] need and you give it to
[56:17] him he will bring it to
[56:20] pass so we have to exercise our faith
[56:27] we have to exercise how we believe in
[56:32] Jesus and ask
[56:35] him and and become
[56:39] stronger and
[56:42] stronger until man we're his
[56:47] power all of his
[56:50] power is fulfilled in
[56:53] US and what did he tell us that we could
[56:59] do all things would we be able to do the
[57:02] same works that you did
[57:05] Jesus yes amen The Works that I do shall
[57:08] you do also more
[57:14] and so what kind of works did Jesus
[57:19] do anybody can anybody tell me come on
[57:23] up come on up
[57:29] he died on the cross that's right he
[57:31] died on the
[57:36] cross and and he not only died on the
[57:40] cross but he also resurrected on the
[57:43] third
[57:46] day and he
[57:48] brought what did he bring for
[57:51] us
[57:53] anybody
[57:55] salvation salvation
[57:58] Salvation how many of you have ever been
[58:00] sick too what does he
[58:02] bring bring good health or bad
[58:05] Health good
[58:07] health does he bring blessings or no
[58:12] blessings good good blessings thank
[58:16] you all right you can be seated amen
[58:20] let's give Jesus an
[58:23] Applause
[58:26] you know it
[58:28] seems it seems very simple
[58:31] right it seems like a children story
[58:35] right but that is how simple our God
[58:41] is if we seek
[58:43] him with a pure
[58:47] heart and we believe in
[58:51] him there is nothing he cannot bring to
[58:54] pass
[58:56] there is no
[58:58] sickness there is no
[59:00] devil there is nothing that can stand
[59:05] before and as young
[59:10] children believe
[59:13] it and become strong in your
[59:16] belief because as you get as you get
[59:19] older in your
[59:22] age life becomes more difficult
[59:27] see the more we
[59:29] know the more we
[59:33] understand the more we need
[59:36] Jesus we need him to help explain all of
[59:40] the difficult things in our
[59:44] life through his
[59:47] word and he gives us those
[59:50] keys the the the the the power of
[59:53] Prayer
[59:55] amen amen amen I see I see sister ampo
[59:59] sitting over there with sister
[1:00:03] Bonnie and I can't help but think of
[1:00:07] brother
[1:00:11] oo what an amazing Warrior of God he he
[1:00:17] is yes he
[1:00:19] is because he is not amongst us
[1:00:23] anymore
[1:00:25] but he is
[1:00:27] alive and better than
[1:00:31] ever and through his faith in
[1:00:37] God he did a lot of
[1:00:42] Miracles praying for
[1:00:45] people giving people
[1:00:49] medicine in the form of
[1:00:53] tapes
[1:00:55] books so we're thankful for our Warriors

[1:04:24] little scriptures in Jesus in the word
[1:04:27] Jesus brought
[1:04:31] us that can help us in our everyday
[1:04:37] life so today we talked about what
[1:04:41] scripture in Sunday school can somebody
[1:04:43] help me those that were in my
[1:04:49] class that's right John 14 1-6 correct
[1:04:56] and what did the scripture tell us can
[1:04:58] somebody else tell
[1:05:03] me okay you want right I'm the way the
[1:05:09] truth the life the door that's right
[1:05:11] that's
[1:05:16] right amen that's part of what he told
[1:05:20] us but he tells us he says let your
[1:05:23] heart not be
[1:05:31] troubled uh uh 141 St John that's right
[1:05:35] just look it up it's right here M
[1:05:37] here right here
[1:05:43] no let your heart not be
[1:05:46] troubled so
[1:05:49] Jesus he doesn't want us to
[1:05:52] worry he doesn't want our heart to be
[1:05:57] troubled he wants us to put all of our
[1:05:59] trust in
[1:06:02] him and he wants to live in our
[1:06:07] heart that's right and he wants to give
[1:06:09] us
[1:06:12] peace
[1:06:14] Joy
[1:06:16] salvation
[1:06:17] happiness health
[1:06:21] blessings
[1:06:22] oh thank you
[1:06:25] Jesus amen so why don't why doesn't my
[1:06:30] uh the children stand really
[1:06:35] quick and repeat after me
[1:06:38] okay he says let your heart not be
[1:06:46] troubled uh believe in God believe in
[1:06:50] God believe also in me
[1:06:58] and listen listen to the promises what
[1:07:00] he tells us where he
[1:07:04] goes and what's
[1:07:07] there he says in my father's
[1:07:11] house are many
[1:07:15] mansions let's repeat it again okay in
[1:07:18] my father's house in my father's
[1:07:21] house are many mansions
[1:07:26] if it were not
[1:07:29] so I would have told
[1:07:34] you now point to
[1:07:39] yourself and prepare a
[1:07:43] place for
[1:07:45] you he went to prepare a place for
[1:07:49] [Music]
[1:07:50] you in a house where there's many
[1:07:53] mansions
[1:07:57] it says and if I go and prepare a place
[1:08:00] for
[1:08:05] you I will come again
[1:08:09] will and receive you unto myself
[1:08:15] reive that where I am
[1:08:19] am there ye may also be there ye may
[1:08:26] and whether I go ye
[1:08:31] know and the way you
[1:08:36] know than you may be
[1:08:41] seated so Jesus Is Telling
[1:08:45] Jesus was telling his
[1:08:49] disciples where he was
[1:08:51] going and what he was going to go do
[1:08:55] because he was going to be leaving the
[1:09:00] scene and they kept asking
[1:09:02] him Jesus can I
[1:09:04] go where are you
[1:09:07] going H how do how are we supposed to
[1:09:11] know where's the father they just kept
[1:09:15] asking him all these
[1:09:16] questions and he finally told
[1:09:20] them but those
[1:09:22] words are for all of
[1:09:25] us so when we ask where's
[1:09:30] Jesus what is the scripture tells
[1:09:32] us that he went to prepare a place for
[1:09:38] us do you trust
[1:09:40] him so if you trust him
[1:09:44] enough if you trust him enough to go and
[1:09:48] prepare a place for
[1:09:52] you why can't we trust him
[1:09:57] enough to give him all of our
[1:10:03] worries all of our
[1:10:06] sickness all of our
[1:10:08] needs
[1:10:10] everything
