[1:06:50] world that for God so loved you
[1:06:56] for God so loved
[1:07:00] me that he
[1:07:02] gave his only
[1:07:06] son his only son the only one he

[1:07:23] life now that is love
[1:07:27] I know it's Christmas
[1:07:29] time I know it's crazy with trying to
[1:07:31] get presents and Christmas
[1:07:36] trees and just driving to work with and
[1:07:39] all these crazy
[1:07:44] people I've never heard on the radio of
[1:07:46] so many accidents in these last few
[1:07:51] weeks even uh the the different
[1:07:54] Billboards on on on the freeway say uh
[1:07:58] don't drive with
[1:08:03] aggression they even got a Star Wars one
[1:08:05] saying trust the
[1:08:09] force but always buckle
[1:08:13] up or the other one said
[1:08:15] uh driving aggressive leads your way to
[1:08:18] the dark
[1:08:22] side I think we're all a little guilty
[1:08:24] of that
[1:08:27] running
[1:08:28] late but I just want to
[1:08:31] say that this drama was
[1:08:35] inspired the love of
[1:08:38] God because if it wasn't for his
[1:08:41] love we wouldn't be
[1:08:44] here if it wasn't for his
[1:08:46] love none of this would be
[1:08:49] possible so without taking any more
[1:08:52] time I give you Christmas unwrapped
[1:09:00] search and rescue for Christ
[1:09:36] what did you know we having this meeting

[1:43:16] time of the year with my children to
[1:43:18] show them what this time is all about
[1:43:21] and it's not about all those festive
[1:43:24] decorations and the fancy dinners or
[1:43:28] even those lavish
[1:43:31] presents it's not even about Santa Claus
[1:43:33] or the Frosted snowman or that little

[1:44:17] patmas beloved let us love one another
[1:44:23] for love is from me and whoever loves is
[1:44:27] born of me and anyone who does not love
[1:44:31] does not know me because I am
[1:44:36] love so you see my little

[1:44:58] [Applause]
[1:45:12] wo like I was up there forever
[1:45:20] [Applause]
[1:45:29] you know when we
[1:45:32] understand how special we
[1:45:36] are we begin to see life so much more
[1:45:42] differently you know Isaiah
[1:45:45] wrote that it pleased the
[1:45:49] Lord to have Jesus be sacrificed
[1:45:55] it pleased God to have Jesus
[1:46:01] bruised to have him
[1:46:03] battered his brones his bones
[1:46:08] broken him hanging on the
[1:46:10] cross and buried in the
[1:46:13] Tomb it pleased
[1:46:17] him because he knew that
[1:46:20] with with that sacrifice
[1:46:24] he would gain all of
[1:46:29] us he would have his people
[1:46:33] back the gap between the Creator and the
[1:46:36] creation was no
[1:46:42] more and I understand that this is not
[1:46:45] the time that Jesus was
[1:46:50] born but we celebrate his birth
[1:46:54] because if it because if he did not come
[1:46:56] in that
[1:47:01] manger if he didn't come in the most
[1:47:03] humble of
[1:47:06] ways and carry that
[1:47:10] [Music]
[1:47:14] cross we'd all be
[1:47:17] lost there would be no
[1:47:19] hope but because of his love
[1:47:23] we are here
[1:47:25] today if we could
[1:47:30] sing and as we sing this song I'd like
