Natural ear but may you speak with a so small voice to the Heart Lord through the spoken word through the read word the word that is [Music] read the word that is heard father for you said in the scriptures he that has a near to hear hear what the spirit says unto the churches the admonition was said every to every Church age Lord God and to this age also there is a voice of God we must listen to it and it is you that speaks to your children through the spoken word you speak through the word but you communicate to us through Revelation Faith a simple understanding of the word help us each one this morning we approach your word may everything be said and done to please you that's what we're trying to do is be pleasing to you Lord ask you these things in the name of Lord Jesus Christ good morning to everybody amen while we're standing would you please open up your scriptures to I believe it's First Kings chapter 16 we we'll read just a few few verses you may be seated it reads as follows and a Ahab the the son of om I'll be reading from the um easy reading King uh King James version um so if it's a little different from the screen forgive me just if you have your Bible just read what the scripture says in the Bible ISS um and Ahab the son of omy did evil in the sight of the Lord above all that were before him verse 31 and it and it came to pass as if it had been a light thing for him to walk in the sins of Jobo the son of nebat that he took as a wife Jezebel the daughter of ithel King of the zidonians and went and served B and worshiped him we don't have time to get into the details of these scriptures home read them over it's every word is it's a mouthful wow and and he reared up again it continues and he reared up an altar for Baal in the house of Baal which he had built in Samaria and Ahab made a Grove and I want you to focus in that on that word and those of us that speak English I ain't talking about the like the orange girles that brother Bernie had over here in the back how many how many were here remember those this houses back here besides brother Bernie house it was all nothing but girls brother of oranges is that right raise your hand if you were here in English it sounds like that but listen to what it says in in Spanish okay and Ahab made a Grove and Ahab did more to provoke the Lord God of Israel to anger than all the kings of Israel that were before him in Spanish it says an image to as is that right correct and it means a sacred post when we get into that you're going to say oh brother Ernie you're you're exaggerating it's right here we're GNA see what this world is worshiping right now um again young people I'm putting this in your hands I'm going down hill but my desire My Heart two about two years ago I think it was a little over a year ago you remember me saying that that I wanted to get this to the young people as older ones we've had our chance if we don't study the message it's our fault and if our young people us and they see I'm talking about me and they see that I don't study the message they're going to or I'm going a role model sort of to speak a bad one but but if they see my nose in the message reading talking about it is not what the scripture says his heart is in is his his whole desire night and day is to meditate on the word of God night and day his instruction the commission to Joshua's you know read that it's in judges one I think Joshua one here I'm commenting and I'm getting all but it's a sacred post s you may be SE it God bless you no we we are going to be speaking on on um jezeb religion part six and please if you read the with me uh you quietly I I'll read it out loud this is what we're focusing on this morning is just Jezebel the woman way back there about 3,000 years ago 700 years ago something like that the woman a natural woman trying to see her what she was in the natural once you understand what she was in the natural then you can see what she is yes what she is today what do you mean she diad she died a long time remember this all started with his stops to Babylons remember that me mentioning that and all those gods and goddesses you see they started way back there with Nimrod and samiramis and young people if you haven't read it yet read pages 186 to 19 five roughly of the exposition of seven Church agents put on your seat belt first so and then put a little pillow underneath right here so when your draw drops it won't hit the ground it's going to shake you I'll just give you one little bit Nimrod nimr or tamuz or Tam that's in Ezekiel 18 all these guys Nimrod is there is identified and then also semiramis is identified there also as a husband and wife or the mother and the son brother Paulie how's that possible he St tell you tells you him that was at one point was both a husband and a son of the woman or you want to say this way the the son and then the the son and then the husband brother brother Ernie what are you saying I'm not saying I'm just telling you to go study like brother Alex says a lot read the book okay not trying to be a smart Al I've gone through this also myself I learned also brother said you're a historian how many of you have studied if you studied the seven Church ages not for you that's good not trying to embarrass you but half of you have read the seven Church ages and you know that it covers a period of History right so you studied history so a loose uh definition of that would be of that is that you are a historian maybe an amateur historian you know I'm I'm I'm you know a minor minor historian okay but I'm still a historian brother said if you read hisop Two Babylons you'll get great light is that how he said it you it there he's got one right there you get great light CU all this garbage filthy religious garbage filthy rotten corrupt I don't have enough adjectives it all goes starts right off over there with Babylon and then it got a Revival Under The Babylon under Nebuchadnezzar his brother B said Babylon in the beginning of the Bible bon in the middle of the Bible and Babylon over here at the end of the Bible but it starts up with semi Ramis as a woman with Nimrod okay you see you understand that and then you have a a new uh semi Ramis with a new name and over there in with Nebuchadnezzar then you have a new semiramis in in Israel and then affecting Judah very beautiful one but then by the time you get to the Book of Revelation not doesn't doesn't say samis I says one thing I got against you is that you suffer that woman who calls herself a proph you know you see what I'm saying so it's very important to understand Jezebel and how it affects us not talking about any young man in particular but just talk to you about one just one thing about um think about the Fashions you're always hitting the sisters brother Ernie well let's talk a little bit about the guys you got small feet brother Ernie average size feet a 10 my height 10 but how many raise your hands be honest with me right now brother ER you're raising up your leg on on on the sacred desk disrespectful cut your thought now don't catch thoughts maybe it's my thought not being disrespectful I'm just trying to show you something I'm off way off I'm off topic right now but how many of you seen those that how many of you have seen those gooes uh I would say more like yeah be more like a a DW a dwarf but more yeah some D like the sort of like the the C gestures you seen those shoes that just kind of keep going how many you seen those they just keep going raise your hand if be honest with that's Jezebel that's a sexual demon that has gotten into the into the in into the man's fashion now we're I I I couldn't say this that's two weeks ago whenever was the last time I spoke cuz we had the young children here here remember that SP about spoke about fear not but in the in this world I forget there's three things that a woman looks at in this culture so watch and the shoes how many of you know that to be sure raise your hand nobody knew that in business they got one back there one back there culturally sh raise your hand brother they need to see your hand raise your hand nice and high brother Alex you're psychologist you know stud psychology how many you know that to be true right brother Alex you know that's to be true seconds takes you only have seven seconds to make a first impression then after a while you don't it's over but wrist they look at the eyes too you know one the two things they look at watch and shoes it's cultural I don't do that brother Ernie then you don't you're not part of that culture do you understand sir SEL you're not part of that culture worldly culture I could add the notse too the look to the nose if he's got one of these uh Rolexes is out the Rolex I'm being silly right now when I say that you understand I know the word being so and the shoes he going to be a good provider the size of the shoes has to do with the size of the anatomy do I need to get more specific do I need to get more specific yes or no that's that's what's that's what she's given us and yes I stand by my first statement well that I made when I when I spoke about the high heels sorry brother Tim I may have heard some brothers from New Mexico but this is a secret to you guys not to them yes cowboys wear high heels okay now we got that so we have brother BR said you got to say something to make the people laugh make him angry your spirit is that right him I got you I got you um interested now in in the rest of this remember we're watching follow just about the woman in the natural and uh so we talked about her as a child already as a young girl now we going to talk to her about as a woman very cursy very superficially just on the surface don't don't think this is all comprehensive that this covers everything young people you got to dig doing this just a surface there's a whole depth in there you understand young people to you I'm I'm putting in your hands now you know if you're under 50 or roughly 50 or below like Tim I think you just turn 50 right 50 I'll say like him for 50 years on down you're a young person yeah brother said when you're you're an old man when you're 50 as the English man would say is that right old man we're talking about Jezebel the woman okay so all of you guys guys I don't like hearing that word across this Pulpit hi guys how you doing brother Paul were here I wouldn't say that see see what I'm saying I wouldn't say guy to brother Bernie I mean so we need to be uh wise judicious but it's that I don't like that word either it's too fancy for here you have to be wise but I but since I say you guys I'm speaking to those of you that are younger folks you you guys younger ones I'm talking to you young people cuz you the Lord placed you in my heart to was to start when I start speaking to focus on on you not to preach like this but to preach so you can understand so we going talk about Jezebel the woman and these attributes many many other ones you you'll find them if you study it she was a princess queen she's a mother the find out brother calls her a devil Priestess sounds good huh oh she's a priestess she's witch and Harlot that's that's other there are other words for that but there use a harlot this is the scripture that shook me that I said oh I got to that made me turn the corner and when we read this of a new generation you just say no or yes if these brothers are with us still if you know who they are think it's brother Kenneth yon Kenneth y raise your hand if if he's still with us say yes is he here with us still on this Earth say yes or no no ice so I can hear you mommy no no he passed away a few weeks ago how many knew that remember remember how many were you here when the Yon Brothers sang Here beautiful singers brother lemel I think it's his name something like that songwriter he's still with us but his his brother B kind lower voice he's not here no more brother brother green green brother Paul Pablo and I can go mention more just recently so this is a scripture came to my that came to that that that woke me up a little bit second judg judges 2 10 through 13 I think it is yes I think that's right right reads as follows and also that generation were gathered to their fathers and there arose another generation after them which knew not the Lord nor yet The Works which he had done for Israel verse 11 and the children of Israel did evil in the sight of the Lord and served balam and they forsook the Lord God of their fathers which brought them out of the land of Egypt and followed other gods of the people of of of people that were around about them and bowed themselves to them and provoke the Lord to anger this this one here is just I mean this this one here is just a you could spend weeks on this and they forsook the Lord jvh in other words the tetraman the four sacred letters Elohim Elohim the only self-existing one who then condescended down into a form of a light that that light was called the Son of God but that light that now appeared to Moses was called a pillar of Fire that was not called Jehovah that the prophet of God told us Jehovah of the Old Testament is the Jesus of the new so he appeared to Paul as a pillar of fire again he said why persecute me why are you persecuting me Paul I'll paraphrase what the conversation I'm not persecuting you I'm persecuting a bunch of Fanatics that they're following this this this this Jesus I am Jesus who are you Lord who are you J who are you Jehovah for the Lord Jesus Christ through Paul he wrote this Hebrews 138 Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever yet we don't understand really what that [Applause] means many of us I didn't understand it until our Prophet our pastor brought us that Cy read right from here he said now noce what brother say notice what Paul is saying that Jesus Christ is the same yesterday he said that was talking about Moses's day your hand heard qu many yesterday Moses Pillar of Fire Jesus Christ he said the same today Paul's saying Paul brother man said when Paul is writing you understand put it in the context of Paul in those days got to go back to him he is the same in every aspect the pillar of fire came down here in 1906 now I challenge you to show me when he went back when did he live when brother Bram died oh please brother says he takes his man never his spirit Pillar of Fire is still here amongst us maybe you might be you might have been one of the lucky ones that was baptized if you if you were when when I refer to that baptism then raise your hand so these people won't think I'm a crazy man people tell me why you need this verification I need a verif ification the word tells me to get verification it says at the M of two or three Witnesses let every word be established so if I'm just talking here by myself I'm a babbling fool what else was new brother ER well if I have confirmation then I I you may consider me still a fool but what I just finished saying was true and you have think then it's your attitude as to what was said Remember the little cat that was cold or wet or whatever and the little girl wanted to warm it up she had good intentions right but what did she do to to to warm it up she threw it in the oven say yes if you know that's to be true amen now I'm just saying say yes if you know that to be true said her her intention was good but her discernment was faulty yeah so be careful about what you to judge what is said what is said when a voice when a word goes out if it's said correctly and I'm trying to be trying to check to really really keep in check to really restrain to Shackle the Ernie berunda eroa and I like that Ernie berunda that when he received his experience speak for him to speak because I was like this the real learninga was me Ernie was like the conscious Ernie was like this but I could see my hands moving speaking I knew what I was going to say I said wow am I going to say that remember that day sister Joan sort I barely remember now to my shame do January 21st 1981 but if you're lucky enough to be here in this Baptist tree when brother Bernie was baptizing he baptized somebody if you if you were remember seeing that raise your hands so other people know that I'm not I'm not speaking like a fool I'm not beating the air as a fool okay how many remember when brother Bernie was baptizing people as soon as he baptized them they come going Hallelujah how raise your hand if you remember you remember that's great you may not remember what he said but I'll if I'm wrong you correct me but I think this is what he said kind of sort of he said you know why these people are coming up like that jumping and yelling and screaming and if you remember him saying this I'm going to say next hand he says as soon as he says as soon as they are baptizing they come up yelling and screaming he says you know why he says because the pillar of fire right there right now raise your hand if you remember hear him saying Sister Sister J please nice and high that's it that's what happened that was 1980 Something 90 Pillar of Fire has been with us oh just a finished Tabernacle no no but he's searching out a BRI but this this next last scripture is shaking and they forsook the Lord and sered ba what is Ba mean Lord so they forsook the Lord and they served Lord come brother are you playing Words with us no no God God has it here L that also means husband ba also means husband so when you you sing you're not going to mention the name of the Lord Jesus at least song leaders Brothers song leaders at least say we sing this going to sing this song to the honor and glory of the Lord Jesus Christ because you just say Lord Lord Lord good to me you might as well be saying ba B you've been so good to me I'm not being funny because you can see here in the scripture in in the in Kings Chronicles and Kings some of the men would name their children I got a scholar right here they would name their son B if you know that to be true raise your hand yes it ba such a common word ba and ASO same word same person same woman different pronunciation in two different cultures both Gods a god ba was a God orar was a god goddess God of fertility and a goddess of fertility and when we get into what they would do and why they would backslide or apostas right away become go into apostasy right away you'll see why readily one King's way up here now the guy worshiping ASO you'll see why okay brother bam tells us about uh United States had a great man like Washington and Lincoln then we had an Ahab and she set the Fashions of the world she said he said we did the same things in take have taken place here this is still just bar reviewing right now jel was a she taught to she was taught to hate Jehovah to hate God's people that hatred in her heart what she was in the absolute brother bam tells us whole nation hated him talking about Elijah he says Jezebel and all the rest of them yeah they hated him very much yeah they they didn't like what he preached and what he did so the next is uh brother man tells us about attitudes so we take the same attitudes we're g to get the same rewards that they got same reward everything and the same blessings or the same penalties brother ER still talking so negatively follow me I was telling brother Junior back there said that I hope people don't miss it that the same time I'm talking about Jezebel doing this here all that junk she's doing in Israel that there's still another group up here like one of the those men are while she's trying to kill the prophets there's one brother that's out there trying to hide him and protect them but a minority I when she brought her Revelation she brought her Revival to Israel sisters you can dress down to here here you can wear down to here brother said I saw this one woman one day she had earrings ring the AR she had some so big it it looked like Satan just sat on her shoulder us her rings like stups and just you know writing her like a yeah that's what he said mad me that's what your your Prophet said my Prophet said that and he said say what the tape say say what the vision say continue okay this is how we the our progress of our study we we saw how Israel parallels and United States and Israel parallel each other and we see we saw her as a girl she introduced the Fashions with with her uh dress and her shoes and so forth and then now we're talk going to talk about and then we talked about the Fashions with the dress now we're talking about Jezebel the woman to me it's gonna get good and good because we're going to get into her religion and you're not going to want to hear these things now when I say that I say that as a general statement I'm not talking to anyone specific person brother brother come here brother you stand about right here your mother is a such and such and such and such and such and such and what are you going to do about [Music] it isn't it true that nobody likes to be talking about I don't want nobody talk about we're orphans aren't we we but we're not orphans because I will not leave you comfortless because the word says I will not leave you comfortless and yes in I will not leave you comfort but in the natural we don't like no when to talk about our mama in a bar that's in the natural and in the spiritual do you think it's the same nobody wants likes to hear that someone else talk about your mama in the spiritual and I can still punch them strike them out strike them out I'll strike him out well at least here he used to call I don't know if you know about our brother but he used to be a colle at Collegiate level used to coach uh baseball right brother many of you don't know this but I'm going to say he doesn't want me to say this you you were offered a coaching job with a Diamond Backs see I ain't as crazy as I look I'm crazier I spoke for Brother David sadu one time how long ago is that about we went to their 50th anniversary anniversary over year ago and he was not there that Sunday morning but he offered me uh to speak Sunday morning for him no offense brother Junior I'm not trying to offend brother Junior but I received a Christmas present that day cuz I was able to speak for an hour and 15 minutes with no interpreter and then after the service I'm just sharing stuff with you after the service we were able to join up with brother uh David again Brother David sadu and he said I I I heard your I saw your message on the on the net say first thank you brother thank you for speaking this morning I saw your message on the internet and I said I thought oh oh and he says you're crazy aren't you I said yes sir he says I like that so I got a little crazy that day yeah it was it was a beautiful day no interpreter just an hour 15 minutes just awesome it was it was my Christmas present I said I always remember that one now we're going to get into her religion then we're going to get into her modern system we've already talked about her modern system already and we don't like to hear that because it gets right next to us let's see uh you'll be Cloud I'll be horse Okay Cloud yeah okay he's he's coming in a White Horse brother but look brother Revelation chapter 19 it says a white horse are you blind and then he says to me behold he cometh with clouds well if that's way you're going to be then go over there and I'll go over here when he says White Horse you say Amen so he's coming in a White Horse just this and you do this sound when The Interpreter says white cloud you shout amen and you do this other sound amen Brothers he's coming in a white cloud Brothers the brothers on that part of the city they don't believe the word I've already spoken with her pastor and I showed him the Bible and where the Prophet said the Bible says white horse quiet horse and they don't believe it they believe a white cloud the white the white Cloud's already come we're waiting for the White Horse amen [Music] [Laughter] amen go ahead I'll Brothers the brothers in Africa the brothers believe that he's coming back on a white horse but he's coming on a white [Applause] cloud I've already spoken with her pastor and he's wrong he's not been able to see this so he's coming in a white cloud that's just a small thing glad you you you enjoy the the the uh I'll say in English I I'm laughing so that I don't cry but we see it all over the place that that filthy woman that dirty filthy rotten woman am I talking about a spirit now she's gone in amongst us that's what I'm trying to get you young people to see brother Ron Peterson Ron Peterson I think this month has happened already you remember what day it is March right we've been invited to go to his service that's a that's a new that's a new one that's something new rarely we're rarely invited by the other churches since I've been invited because they invited the church am I going to be there I'm going to be there now they're not going to have an interpreter for you you know that's been discussed already many times before but if you speak English and you're you feel you're strong you know cuz you may you may you may meet some brothers that look at you like I went back East this is in Jeffersonville I'm not attacking brother just not against Brother Joseph or nobody he was not part of it but I think it was one of the Easter meetings in 84 85 years ago sister Joan am I that old now yeah and I received what I call the boycott Shuffle thank you awesome it say we were sitting we there some brothers about five or six of us were standing here in a circle and I could sense it I'm not a spiritual person but I could sense it they didn't move they stood right there but I could sense her spirit does that make any sense brother Serio sense in their Spirit the brother says where where you from brother said in Kentucky Tennessee Kentucky so Tennessee uh you know Mississippi different places Florida Florida and then it came to me you know I'm from Phoenix so the Phoenix really Phoenix oh the Phoenix brother Bernie Garcia's church and and I sense this say say I'm from Phoenix I'm Phoenix Phoenix Phoenix Tabernacle Phoenix I I sense that there's like a almost like they froze move they didn't move it just like but the same brother I said they saying they were saying have you seen the prophet you know what I'm talking about brother I saw him yeah I came up to him I shook his hand I give him a hug and he said you hug the prophet I said yeah why not he my brother sway system it's amongst us I could talk about small circle draw a bigger Circle all that but it just it's not until it's not unless you live it that you that you can live live it okay and then just about the witch we're going to get into that the the the witch now remember and if you want to read ahead just read all those and listen to the tapes and read all those parts when brother BR talks about the preview of the Bride I how many you know what I'm talking about a few of you okay ask those other brothers here ra what is he talking about and he said that they were were marching to that Rhythm and rock and roll from America he says the filthiest group he had ever seen was worse than the as Asiatic Asian Church worse and worse and worse if you've never heard this brothers and sisters let me share something with you young people you guys go study this young people brother Bram said the following he said he says I believe that England should be sunk it's a it's a sess pool of the world yeah it's a oh it's not the it's not the plumbing that takes the the waste to the Sea it's a septic tank Suess Suess and he say successful he said I believe that England's successful of the world I'm sorry I keep going to Spanish I'm sorry okay where the be young people where the beetles come from England what about the Rolling Stones yeah when when Satan knew exactly what he was doing when he brought brought in those guys those insects Rolling Stones rolling ston you know what you know what a stone is right it's a revelation that that that introduced satanic music into the United States and it's getting worse and it's gotten better and better right it's got worse and worse and worse and worse okay but then here young people this is what you guys can study this brother man said he said um he says uh I think should be sunk and it's a it's the Cesspool of the world and then he said and the United States The Prostitute of the Nations that's what he said if you know he said that raise your hand please thank you many of you heard that okay so we want to get into the the witch that she that and that and that and that all that church of America she was being led and we're going to break that down exactly you're not going to like it you're not going to like it cuz you shouldn't be saying that or brother Bram said it pastor already well leave it to him to him brother brother Bernie I'm not going to say what I was going to say but I will say this much I did talk to him about speaking about this and he said this so the people need to hear it Ernie oh going to say well yeah on the tape he was talking to me when I said I was going to say it try to I'm not trying to justify myself wrong you're wrong because brother BR say many places say if you don't have a closed line religion You Don't Preach a Clos line you much of a preacher said know brother so you can see if you're preacher If You Don't Preach a Clos line religion I doubt that you even have a Ministry goes for the man and the women okay men should dress a certain way women should women should dress a certain way but the Holy Ghost should you know should tell should lead us to all truth and righteousness brother those two Spirits are so close to each other when you preach against Jezebel you don't like it you're wrong I was trying to like I said earlier I didn't say finish I start I'm trying to get away from that trying to keep that spirit that F the fercal and legalistic spirit so what brother so you can see what brother Brown said but the older folks we're we're pretty much set in our ways young people are more malleable more uh uh uh able to accept the things the prophet said with a nobler heart brother Bram when he was talking to to Bram Tabernacle in the Hebrews book in the messages there he said many of you are legalistic no over 90% of you are he says no that's okay because he also said to one lady sister I didn't see you send you at church well I was I was doing my laundry you know I'm not legalistic about that he said well you better be about Sunday so if I say that about working on Sunday and I just say what brother B said some of you are not going to like it because he said you shouldn't work on Sunday see I I'm already preaching it sorry I don't know who said that over there I'm not trying to embarrass you brother that CU it cuts me deeply right but you know they told Brother yeah but you know the the scripture says that you know if your Ox falls into the D that that that you can in the Sabbath you can pull them out and brother Bram using humor so he won't cut him use a little humor he says yes brother but don't push him in you you go up to the to the list for scheduling man I I got to work Sunday because I gotta make some I got to make some coins not talking about anybody specifically anybody could have won millions of dollars a lawsuit it would have been brother Johnny Al when he worked for standard Brands standard Brands and he and he was fighting to get Sundays off to go to church he didn't want to work I think it was 18 years old almost 50 years ago more or less 50 years ago uh no it wasn't that long uh he was 23 I think so anyway he was long time ago yeah and the day that they were going to fire him uh his boss was fired because he was stealing money from the company the that's brother Johnny's boss that is soole the money and uh so I apologize to you for for not getting very far I think it's I'm way past time now would you please stand uh we notice what we want to do is just follow natural the natural jbel and then we see that her natural traits are type of spiritual trait and this is what brother Ram said everything that's everything that's called that's mean is called Jezebel it's a system it's it's it's it's it's so um pervasive it's so everywhere it's like this is of this is a sense of humor it's so ubiquitous and brother Alex it's so everywhere we can't even discern it but when you can sense it when she's attacked on the platform and you feel a little uncomfortable or angry or upset and it's those spirits that try to anoint us they don't like it because we're talking about her mother and they don't like it in the spiritual just like you don't like it if you're if I talk about your mom right now something you jump up here and you so it's same thing in the spiritual but the only way she can affect you you yield yourself to her spirit you understand little bit okay so we're going to get into that uh later on and then uh let's us pray and thank the Lord and uh it I'd love to sing that song um that we were singing when I came up here uh open my eyes Lord we sing that song and then our brother that's going to be uh singing uh taking over will come up front please Heavenly Father we thank you Lord for your word this morning you know that my 100% intention was to just read Lord as a Sunday school lesson perhaps next time lord uh we can get into the [Music] lesson forgive me if I did wrong [Music] Lord I don't apologize for what I said Lord because I I believe I was trying to say what your word says maybe I should have stayed more to reading Lord forgive me forgive me but there's so much to be said that I I get a little anxious Lord know wanting the people the young people Lord to understand and just go off and study this Lord but I know many of them have not even taken that first step and that's to hear or read Jezebel religion they'll see why brother Branham even a year later after he preaches it almost to the day almost to the day he says read or hear je about religion what an awesome message and then he says may in that message of Jezebel religion you know Lord he said may you never forget this afternoon so let we we thank you Father accept our our

them now Lord Jesus your messenger told us this morning that you sent us your word for our benefit and then he said that he sent the Holy Ghost to Quicken to make that word real in your life so God put this need in you my brother my sister so that the Holy Ghost could draw closer unto you so that your spirit would call out and say Lord I don't have the answer I don't know but I'm calling unto you that Holy Spirit Jesus we just heard that this today brother Ernie just mentioned it that logus that brother Bernie saw in the Baptist tree was nothing less than the Lord Jesus Christ and it

forgive me forgive me Lord I stand before your mercy seat sentenced to death if you don't save me Lord I'll perish and God so loving sends his son and sheds his blood and he says daughter son I don't

love you and if you run into problems just take the blood of Jesus upon your life God being merciful will forgive you you have nothing to fear nothing to fear the holy spirit is right with you and oh
