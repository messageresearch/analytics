[10:56] tonight tonight we have a special treat
[11:00] as um it's once again it's an honor to
[11:02] be
[11:03] here before you to deliver um an
[11:08] abstract or an exert to put it more
[11:11] accurately from the book Supernatural
[11:13] the life of William brandham book one
[11:15] the boy in his deprivation 1909 to
[11:18] 1932 as you know we have been covering
[11:23] the book from its
[11:25] beginning and there are 11 chapters in
[11:27] the book tonight I'll be doing in ed
[11:29] oberved from the last three pages of the
[11:31] book as you might expect there are some
[11:34] Supernatural events that take place we
[11:38] see this particular exert will set up
[11:41] the future and it actually demonstrates
[11:45] to us the beginning of our prophet's
[11:48] ministry right before our eyes what a
[11:51] wonderful thing that is and we're so
[11:54] thankful that we have a brother as
[11:56] precious as brother Oren jurgenson that
[11:58] took the time to put this series
[12:00] together and we're so thankful that the
[12:03] Lord led him to do this and that our
[12:07] precious brother Perry green made sure
[12:10] that it got published there's a story
[12:12] behind that we'll Lord willing will'll
[12:14] cover that in the
[12:16] future but it's it once again it's an
[12:18] honor to be before you tonight chapter
[12:21] 11 is entitled ordained to a
[12:23] supernatural gospel from
[12:27] 1932 a fact that might be worth pointing
[12:30] out here is that brother Brandon was
[12:33] ordained as a minister of the Gospel of
[12:35] Jesus Christ according to the laws and
[12:38] bylaws of the Missionary Baptist Church
[12:41] he was ordained by Dr Roy Davis around
[12:44] Christmas Day
[12:47] 1932 we pick it up later in the chapter
[12:51] after brother Brandon had prayed for a
[12:53] colored man in a Catholic Hospital who
[12:57] was miraculously healed
[13:00] we pick it up the next
[13:03] morning the next morning Billy got up at
[13:06] Daybreak as he fumbled in the halflight
[13:09] for his clothes the room was suddenly
[13:11] bathed in full daylight as though
[13:14] someone had turned it on by a
[13:16] switch Bill instantly realized that he
[13:19] was no longer in his own house the room
[13:22] that he now found himself in was larger
[13:25] than his bedroom it looked something
[13:28] like a living room
[13:29] with a sofa a club chair an ottoman end
[13:33] tables and lamps except that in one
[13:37] corner sat a High
[13:38] bed on this bed lay a middle-aged woman
[13:42] hideously
[13:43] crippled Bill watched in amazement as
[13:47] This Woman's Twisted limb straightened
[13:49] out and became normal the woman climbed
[13:52] out of the bed and walked directly at
[13:54] him which let Bill get a good look at
[13:57] her face then he was back in the
[13:59] halflight of his own
[14:02] room Billy sat on the edge of his bed
[14:04] for a long time puzzling it over
[14:08] obviously the Lord Jesus was going to
[14:10] deliver someone else but who and
[14:13] when he thought well I'll probably find
[14:16] out where she's at
[14:19] today that day his work
[14:22] assignment took him to
[14:24] 2223 East Oak Street in New Albany a
[14:28] family had moved out from one side of a
[14:31] double tenement house and Bill needed to
[14:33] shut off the water to that one side only
[14:37] but at the box it wasn't clear which
[14:39] meter went to which
[14:41] side he twisted the valve closed on one
[14:44] meter then stepped around to the
[14:46] occupied side of the duplex to
[14:49] check an attractive teenage girl poorly
[14:52] dressed answered his knock what do you
[14:55] want I work for the Public Service
[14:57] Company which would you try the water to
[15:00] see if it's off certainly the girl
[15:03] stepped around the corner into her
[15:04] kitchen standing in the doorway bill
[15:07] could see a woman lying on a hospital
[15:09] typ bed in the living room her body was
[15:12] extremely Twisted making her look like a
[15:14] shriveled spider the bed elevated her
[15:17] head and her and faced towards the door
[15:20] so that Billy could see her face clearly
[15:22] his heart leaped with excitement this
[15:25] was the crippled woman he had seen that
[15:27] morning in a vision
[15:29] she was reading a black covered book a
[15:32] newspaper lay scattered on the floor
[15:34] beside her
[15:35] bed how do you do ma'am my name is BR
[15:38] Billy brandham hello mine is Mary D
[15:42] ohanyan my daughter there is
[15:44] Dorothy Dorothy came back into the room
[15:47] and said no the water is still
[15:50] on I guess I turned off the right meter
[15:53] then thank you for checking but he
[15:55] didn't leave somehow he must strike a
[15:59] conversation with this crippled
[16:01] woman what is that you are
[16:04] reading an Armenian Bible she answered
[16:07] he challenged her do you
[16:10] believe Mrs durl Hanan set the book down
[16:13] in her lap Dorothy is 17 years old since
[16:17] the time she was born I've been crippled
[16:20] in bed but this morning I read the paper
[16:23] about a man being healed over at the
[16:25] Catholic Hospital and I said there's
[16:28] hope for me
[16:29] say did you say your name was brandom
[16:32] she took off her reading glasses to
[16:34] stare at the young man standing in the
[16:36] doorway of her living room her
[16:38] expression changed as she connected this
[16:41] young meter man with the faceless
[16:43] brandom in the newspaper
[16:45] article are you the man of God that
[16:48] healed that colored man last
[16:50] night no ma'am I'm not a Healer I was
[16:54] showed by something that I should pray
[16:56] for that man the Lord Jesus is the
[16:58] Healer not me the woman nodded ever
[17:02] since I read about that Miracle I've
[17:04] been asking God for one in my own life
[17:07] would you pray for me Billy looked at
[17:10] this woman whose Twisted limbs had
[17:12] suffered 17 years of atrophy and he said
[17:16] cautiously I'll go pray about this and
[17:18] then I'll come
[17:19] back he found a place to be alone with
[17:22] God and prayed until his courage matched
[17:25] the vision then he drove over to George
[17:28] the ark's
[17:29] house brother George I met the woman I
[17:32] was telling you about this morning I
[17:34] know it's the same one come with
[17:36] me the two of them entered the duplex
[17:39] and stood next to miss ohanyan's bed
[17:43] while the woman hugged her Armenian
[17:45] Bible to her heart Dorothy and her
[17:47] 8-year-old brother hid behind the
[17:49] Christmas tree on the other side of the
[17:51] living room snickering and making fun of
[17:53] the whole idea to think that their
[17:55] mother would get out of bed after lying
[17:58] there for 17 years what a
[18:00] joke Bill ignored the children miss
[18:03] ohanyan the Lord Jesus is going to heal
[18:06] you Billy and George got on their knees
[18:09] and started to
[18:11] pray eyelids even when shut will still
[18:14] allow light to touch the pupils and
[18:17] through his eyelids Bill saw a light
[18:19] turned on over Miss ohanyan he opened
[18:23] his eyes expecting to see an electric
[18:26] bulb instead he saw an Amber Ring of
[18:29] Fire circling above her
[18:32] bed all gripped him a breathless fear
[18:36] mixed with a probing
[18:38] curiosity this must be the same light
[18:40] that had formed a cross in the air when
[18:43] he was praying in the shed behind his
[18:45] house inspired Bill reached over took
[18:49] hold of the woman's hand and
[18:50] said miss ohanyan the Lord Jesus told me
[18:53] this morning that you was going to be
[18:56] made well rise up on your feet and walk
[18:58] in in the name of Jesus throwing her
[19:01] covers aside she wiggled towards the
[19:03] edge of the bed using her withered arms
[19:05] and legs to inch herself along like a
[19:08] caterpillar Bill had one flash of
[19:11] misgiving thinking that if he let her
[19:13] fall off that High bed she might break
[19:16] her neck when she hit the floor then he
[19:19] thought of the vision of William Merill
[19:22] how perfect it had been how uniring and
[19:25] his confidence
[19:27] returned as soon as as Miss ohanyan slid
[19:29] over the edge of the bed both her legs
[19:33] suddenly straightened out right before
[19:34] everyone's eyes Dorothy screamed a
[19:37] shrill insane scream and pulling her
[19:39] hair darted out the front door still
[19:41] shrieking at the top of her voice
[19:43] neighbors came running from every
[19:45] direction jamming the doorway gawking in
[19:47] disbelief watching their neighbor Mary
[19:49] dur ohanyan who for the first time in 17
[19:53] years was walking around her living room
[19:56] holding two good arms above her head as
[19:58] she praised the Lord Jesus Christ in her
[20:01] native Armenian
[20:03] tongue bill went home excited and joyful
[20:06] about these wonderful visions that were
[20:08] preceding such Miracles but soon his
[20:11] excitement would dampen soon his Joy
[20:14] would turn into fear his next vision
[20:17] would be strikingly different and when
[20:19] he would describe this Vision to his
[20:21] Pastor Bill would be confused by his
[20:24] pastor's response it would begin for him
[20:27] years of uncertainty that would
[20:29] eventually drive him to discover the
[20:31] secret behind his peculiar life a secret
[20:35] that would launch the greatest Faith
[20:37] Healing Ministry that the world has ever
[20:40] seen God bless
[20:44] [Applause]
