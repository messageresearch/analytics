[8:56] radio program this morning
[9:01] and my soul was delighted as i heard
[9:22] and i want to give a very special
[9:24] welcome to brother thomas perez
[9:30] i understand that he's here although i
[9:32] can't see very well i believe he's here
[9:33] hey let's help
[9:59] when the brother presents him as a as a
[10:01] bosom friend of brother bernie
[10:14] although i know him since we were
[10:17] children
[10:20] but i don't remember those years
[10:24] but i do remember his father and my
[10:26] father
[10:29] and we give thanks to god because he's
[10:30] here
[10:59] apostolic doctrine for phoenix
[11:00] tabernacle
[11:09] my heart desires that each and every one
[11:11] of you reach the place where
[11:41] followers of me even as i also am of
[11:43] christ
[11:53] he never says or is trying to say bg
[11:56] imitators of christ
[12:00] he's saying specifically he imitators of
[12:02] me
[12:07] that's the reason why the profit of the
[12:09] age
[12:11] he told me
[12:15] don't preach me a message
[12:18] give me the message
[12:35] therefore the first commandment that god
[12:36] is
[12:50] the second scripture is to be found in
[12:51] john chapter 14
[12:57] the one who's speaking here is the same
[12:59] jesus christ
[13:02] our savior
[13:15] you see because we couldn't be redeemed
[13:32] you
[13:45] but if you don't believe in him it is in
[13:46] vain
[14:15] i therefore the prisoner of the lord
[14:17] beseech you that you walk worthy of the
[14:19] vocation wherewith you're called
[14:25] i believe that each and every one of us
[14:27] was called
[14:54] and live accordingly to how you have
[14:56] been
[15:11] when i gave all diligence to write unto
[15:13] you
[15:17] of the common salvation necessarily
[15:24] argentina
[15:29] it was needful for me to write unto you
[15:31] and exhort you
[15:32] that you should earnestly contend for
[15:34] the faith which was once delivered unto
[15:37] the saints
[15:51] it is
[16:47] that we love ourselves
[16:51] one and the other and to be able to
[16:53] understand
[16:55] each other if the people do not
[16:57] understand
[16:59] for years i've said this the prophet
[17:01] says this
[17:15] but if you don't love
[17:40] three messages
[17:58] who have read all three messages
[18:01] three small messages
[18:05] why are we not a denomination
[18:27] that the brother spoke about john who
[18:28] was mute
[18:31] i'll tell you that he wasn't the only
[18:33] one
[18:34] there's a lot of mutes among us amongst
[18:37] us
[18:39] i'll ask you again
[19:02] maybe some of you it was a little heavy
[19:03] with the the the things that i spoke
[19:08] it might have been a little difficult
[19:09] for you
[19:11] and to me it was just very simple
[19:16] there was about 16 or 17 things that i
[19:18] mentioned
[19:19] i'm a human as you are
[19:35] and doing it like this we might be able
[19:37] to finish within the hour
[19:43] the answer that i want you to understand
[19:48] i go back to the title doctrine
[19:58] which is essential and elemental for
[20:00] phoenix tabernacle
[20:03] we are
[20:18] [Music]
[20:32] this morning
[20:46] don't you believe
[21:00] morning
[21:03] john chapter 6
[21:13] all that the father giveth me shall come
[21:14] to me and him that cometh
[21:17] to me i will in no wise cast out juan
[21:20] said john chapter 6 verse 44.
[21:24] [Music]
[21:27] no man can come to me
[21:56] and shall ascend
[22:30] that scripture should take us to give
[22:31] him an applause
[22:51] for they are thine
[23:06] on a certain occasion we were in the
[23:07] ramadan
[23:10] and they asked a certain question
[23:15] i allowed certain individuals to answer
[23:17] it
[23:20] and
[23:31] and this is what the book of jobs speaks
[23:34] about
[24:29] and all the sons of god shouted for joy
[24:35] so then i knew back then that there was
[24:37] a lot of people that didn't understand
[24:40] but brother branham is telling me
[24:50] when he interprets the scripture in
[24:51] revelation chapter 17 verse 8
[24:57] when did he place your name
[25:22] when the lord jesus christ
[25:44] [Music]
[26:19] and they agreed
[26:36] you're going to live amongst mortals
[26:39] when you're born
[26:42] you will be born with an incorrect
[26:44] spirit for your way of
[26:46] heart but watch now because
[26:50] i will die
[26:59] [Music]
[27:04] so then i will
[27:18] you're going to
[27:31] because there is
[27:35] [Music]
[27:45] because you are a part of that
[27:59] the man said fine that is well
[28:05] so then we get to the point where we
[28:06] understand
[28:11] i might not be able to say it very well
[28:12] in spanish but he will
[28:33] so look at a picture of when you were
[28:35] young and good looking
[28:38] they'd say about 21 years of age what a
[28:41] tremendous brand
[28:55] of the lord jesus christ
[29:50] and because he's a good contractor
[30:04] where his children were to dwell in
[30:10] [Music]
[30:34] hey
[31:12] the prophet says man is made in the
[31:14] image of god
[31:31] put him to sleep
[31:34] and he took a rib out of man
[31:37] and from that rib he formed woman
[31:40] which is the image of man
[31:44] you see they were won
[31:48] because there was an atom
[31:51] when god's image came
[31:54] there was a masculine and a feminine
[31:56] silence
[31:58] which were in
[32:26] if you follow
[32:39] we surrender ourselves to the word
[32:55] his name is william brown
[33:02] when he did all these things
[33:06] and after he had taken a woman out
[33:20] who's the man that's not afraid to move
[33:22] quickly lightly
[33:25] come it's hard to follow me
[33:28] the doctor he
[33:32] he dares to come because he's a doctor
[34:04] yes
[34:32] oh
[34:46] he knows
[35:14] we must speak with
[35:42] she speaks
[35:55] and to explain to them what god has
[35:57] given us
[35:59] very well he says
[36:05] all of this
[36:10] adam
[36:22] look we can eat of everything
[36:38] everything was fine
[36:52] you see
[37:05] but you see he couldn't really come out
[37:07] and show that he was a savior
[37:13] that mankind fall
[37:16] he knew he had partners and that they
[37:19] were willing
[37:47] and he was going to unite to the
[38:00] the prophet says it's the day of grace
[38:44] about 325 a day
[38:47] the prophets of god
[38:51] and those who had the intellectuals
[38:55] fought for several days with them
[38:58] and finally
[39:46] [Music]
[39:55] in in revelation chapter 7
[39:58] she's a mother she's the mother of
[40:00] harlot
[40:03] she's not mother of children
[40:06] because the harlot is a woman
[40:22] under liberty
[40:35] because two horns come out of
[40:50] drinking of the wine of her fornication
[40:54] that's why the bible speaks
[40:57] excuse me the prophet speaks
[41:00] about the woman's hair she should not
[41:04] cut her hair
[41:31] in order to be strong
[42:00] of the world
[42:13] the only way that you can be a partner
[42:56] what
[43:07] the name of our messenger
[44:20] not
[44:33] a person who is a stutterer
[44:48] one

[49:13] song was a hard
[49:14] song and afterwards

[57:37] just sit down and
[58:06] what
[58:13] [Music]
[58:18] [Music]
[58:35] about but such a great cloud of
[58:36] witnesses let us say aside every word
[58:39] everything ever wrong every evil word
[58:42] every bad spoken word every thought
[58:45] let us run with patience the race that
[58:47] set before us
[58:49] looking to the author and finisher of
[58:51] our faith the lord
[58:52] jesus christ oh blessed be his
[58:55] most matchless and holy name how that he
[58:58] came to earth to redeem
[59:00] fallen man and to bring them back into
[59:02] the fellowship of the lord
[59:04] god and we thank thee for this and now
[59:07] by his grace
[59:09] we never chose him but he chose us he
[59:11] said you have not chosen me but i chose
[59:13] you
[59:14] when before the foundation of the world
[59:16] and dear god if there be some sitting
[59:18] here this morning
[59:19] maybe who's cut this off for years and
[59:21] years but constantly
[59:23] there's a little knocking at the heart
[59:25] maybe they joined church thinking well
[59:27] it'll be all right
[59:28] father sure the scriptures has explained
[59:30] it this morning that you cannot hide
[59:32] behind a church and be
[59:34] righteous neither can you be good not
[59:36] lying steal and do anything bad and
[59:38] still be righteous
[59:39] there's only one righteousness we have
[59:41] not of our own but his righteousness
[59:44] he has perfected our salvation therefore
[59:47] being in him god does not see our
[59:48] mistakes
[59:49] when we do anything wrong there's a
[59:50] spirit that screams out oh father
[59:52] forgive me
[59:53] then god does not see it and so we're
[59:56] brought into fellowship and grace with
[59:58] him
[59:58] granted lord while we close this service
[1:00:00] in christ's name
[1:00:01] amen just for a moment i'd like to ask
[1:00:04] you

[1:04:01] i thought well the president would come
[1:04:02] to town instead of the revival
[1:04:04] everybody come out oh sure that's whirly
[1:04:06] then i got to think well god how
[1:04:08] why don't you just go come on jesus
[1:04:10] let's have it over with i won't just
[1:04:12] just go and have it all over and let it
[1:04:14] go
[1:04:15] then i began to see something moving in
[1:04:16] front of me it looked like a little
[1:04:18] whirl going around like this
[1:04:20] i kept watching and i saw a world
[1:04:23] turning around
[1:04:24] and around now washington where it was
[1:04:26] spraying something off
[1:04:28] now look there was a spray of red
[1:04:30] crimson blood
[1:04:31] across around the world it was like a
[1:04:33] world going around like a comet
[1:04:35] and had a whirl around like this and i
[1:04:37] looked at this world
[1:04:38] and just above it i saw jesus in the
[1:04:42] vision
[1:04:42] he was looking down and i see myself
[1:04:46] standing down here on the earth doing
[1:04:48] the things that i should not do
[1:04:50] and every time that i see him god would
[1:04:52] have killed me because the day the other
[1:04:54] day you died
[1:04:55] god's holiness and justice required and
[1:04:58] you'd have to die
[1:04:59] and then i looked at it i kept rubbing
[1:05:01] my eyes i said i'm not i never went to
[1:05:03] sleep
[1:05:04] it's a vision i'm sure this is a vision
[1:05:06] i kept watching as i stood behind the
[1:05:08] door
[1:05:09] and i've seen my own sin come up and
[1:05:11] every time we would start to hit the
[1:05:13] throne
[1:05:14] his blood act like a bumper on the car
[1:05:17] it caught it and see it shake the blood
[1:05:20] and run down his face and
[1:05:21] i see him raised his hands and said
[1:05:23] father forgiving
[1:05:24] he doesn't know what he's doing i've
[1:05:26] seen myself do something else
[1:05:28] that shook him again god would have
[1:05:31] killed me right then
[1:05:33] but his blood wasn't catching me it was
[1:05:35] holding my sin
[1:05:37] oh god did i do that surely it wasn't me
[1:05:40] but it was then i went walking like this
[1:05:43] like i was going through that room and i
[1:05:44] walked up close to him
[1:05:46] i seen a book laying there and had my
[1:05:47] name on it all kinds of black letters
[1:05:50] wrote across it
[1:05:51] i said lord i'm sorry i did this that my
[1:05:54] sins caused you to do that
[1:05:55] did i spin your blood around the world
[1:05:57] but i
[1:05:58] did i do this to you lord i'm so sorry
[1:06:01] that i did it
[1:06:02] he reached out i said will you forgive
[1:06:04] me i didn't need you all
[1:06:05] you buy your grace i'll try to be a
[1:06:07] better boy if you just help me
[1:06:08] he took his hand and patted his side
[1:06:11] tucked his finger rolled pardoned on my
[1:06:13] book
[1:06:13] throw it over behind him to see if her
[1:06:16] gift was i watched it
[1:06:18] a little bit and he said now i forgive
[1:06:21] you but you want to condemn her
[1:06:24] so you're forgiven but what about her
[1:06:26] you want to blow her up
[1:06:27] you didn't want her to live oh god
[1:06:31] forgive me i didn't mean to think that i
[1:06:34] didn't want to do that
[1:06:35] i i i didn't want to do that you're
[1:06:37] forgiven you feel all right but what
[1:06:39] about her she needs it too
[1:06:41] she needs it well i thought got it i
[1:06:44] know who you've called and who you
[1:06:45] haven't called
[1:06:46] it's my business to speak to everyone so
[1:06:49] when the vision left me
[1:06:50] i walked over to her i said how do you
[1:06:53] do lady
[1:06:54] and then two men and went to the
[1:06:55] restroom and she was sitting there
[1:06:57] hiccuping you know laughing the bottle
[1:07:00] of whiskey sitting on the table or beer
[1:07:02] was uncle sitting there where they've
[1:07:04] been drinking i woke up and said how do
[1:07:06] you do and she said
[1:07:07] oh hello and i said could i sit down she
[1:07:10] said oh i got company
[1:07:11] i said i didn't mean it in that way
[1:07:13] sister she looked at me when i called
[1:07:15] her sister
[1:07:16] she said what do you want i said could i
[1:07:17] sit down yesterday she said help
[1:07:19] yourself

[1:07:24] said brandon
[1:07:25] she said you the man down here in this
[1:07:26] arena i said yes ma'am
[1:07:28] she said i've been wanting to come down
[1:07:30] there she said mr branham i was raised
[1:07:32] in a christian family
[1:07:34] she said i got two young girls this
[1:07:35] christian but
[1:07:37] certain certain things happened and she
[1:07:38] got on the wrong road and started
[1:07:40] i said but sister i don't care the
[1:07:43] blood's still around
[1:07:45] you this world's covered over his blood
[1:07:47] if he didn't got to kill us everyone
[1:07:49] he when that blood's moved look out for
[1:07:51] judgment but now if you
[1:07:53] die without that blood you go beyond
[1:07:56] that place
[1:07:57] then there's nothing to act for you
[1:07:59] today the blood acts in your stead
[1:08:01] i said lady sure the blood still got you
[1:08:04] covered as long as you got breath in
[1:08:06] your body the blood has you covered
[1:08:08] but someday when the breath leaves here
[1:08:09] the soul goes out you'll go beyond that
[1:08:11] blood and there's nothing but judgment
[1:08:13] while you've got a chance for pardon and
[1:08:15] i'll talk about the hand she's crying
[1:08:17] so mr brown and i'm drinking i said that
[1:08:19] don't hurt
[1:08:20] something another ass warned me to come
[1:08:23] tell you

[1:08:26] calls you sister
[1:08:27] and you're doing wrong and you're only
[1:08:29] making it worse
[1:08:31] she said did you think you would have me
[1:08:32] i said absolutely he'd have you
[1:08:35] there on her knees we got down in the
[1:08:38] middle of that floor
[1:08:40] and an old-fashioned prayer meeting that
[1:08:43] police took off his head and bowed on
[1:08:45] one knee

[1:13:26] they notify the commandments you know it
[1:13:29] now because god spoke to your heart
[1:13:32] they looked at the commandments thou
[1:13:33] shalt not commit adultery
[1:13:35] thou shalt not uh do so and so
[1:13:38] and they took a lamb went put their
[1:13:40] hands on the lamb priest cut the throat

[1:13:44] bleeding and blading and dying his hand
[1:13:46] is all covered with the blood the lamb
[1:13:48] died in his fins
[1:13:49] but he walked out with the same desire
[1:13:51] to do it again
[1:13:52] but in this place we come by faith
[1:13:56] through grace god called us we lay our
[1:13:59] hands on the head
[1:14:00] of the lamb of god we hear that swinging
[1:14:04] hammer

[1:14:11] doing
[1:14:13] see by faith we feel his death there in
[1:14:16] our sin
[1:14:17] way then in our heart comes a deep
[1:14:19] settle peace when a voice says your

[1:16:15] that it must stay earthbound because
[1:16:17] gravitation hold it down
