[0:00] You may be seated. Greet you tonight in
[0:03] the name of the Lord. Brother Bernie,
[0:05] today your birthday
[0:17] younger than I am, so I can tell you.
[0:21] &gt;&gt; Well, that's a bold.
[0:23] &gt;&gt; No, I don't think so. The brain just
[0:25] smiles on our speedometers. That's all
[0:27] right.
[0:29] I just got 117 days old. We were both
[0:31] born in 1933.
[0:34] I'm pretty
[0:35] &gt;&gt; 25 years old 58.
[0:40] We want you to take this $500 and spend
[0:43] it on yourself.
[0:56] That's probably
[1:00] that's not an offering to the church.
[1:03] Not an offering to your wife.
[1:07] &gt;&gt; Has to be spent on yourself.
[1:10] Buy something you want and need from all
[1:14] of us.
[1:15] God bless you.
[1:28] [Music]
