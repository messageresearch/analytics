Tito would be called birth pains said the Lord is a part now this is a message that you know we've heard many times sorry su mensaje que mo so you nobody has basis it's Elementary a salvo basically mentality it's something that for us to be Christians a Saluki para que podamos el Christiano's we have to cross those roles tenemos que pasar por sus Caminos we have to look at this face to face tenemos que Mira es su cara cara and realize that it's only by the grace of God Janos cuentas que solamente is por la Gracia that uses that we are saved today in equality it always some solace but today I want to just refresh in your mind there's an estate via no mosquito reference car to maintain something very simple a little more sense see you you know today a lot of people or today everybody's into being fit some well you know those kids that Aptos physique I mean everybody wants to eat the right thing so it's getting Camilla cosa correcta so what people usually do they're looking normally in the SLS personas now with all the technology out of control that technology they like to take pictures of themselves before they start getting fit take it into my photography fears they see mismo antes de que pueden try them when a condition when a forma before they start getting their muscles aunt is a a poder concierges musculus and well they go through the process mientras que van por el proceso they're gonna go through some hard times van a pasar por algunas difficult artists to where they get to the point hasta que hagan SLE Punto to they say oh well nothing's happening here he said he's in prison - I know anyone resultado I don't see myself getting fit know where the key guys - he ain't runnin whenif or mass so so what they do is they go back to that picture and the Nokia's in his categories and is a photographic and they realize it's a nun Quinta that they made such a great progress can on each egg and progress so because they go back to the beginning regression al principio and that's what we have to do sometimes in our spiritual life yeah versus an ultra-beam espírito a look at enemas casera we have to go back tenemos que regresar - who we used to be again antes Aramis and who Jesus Christ he can he sue Cristo yes tonight is in esta noche what he came to do for us lo que el vino said para nosotros sometimes we go along the way a veces vamos por el camino and we realize that we're just not overcoming the way we should be you knows that most winters can no stumbles we've seen those Monica debemos but sometimes we gotta go back to the world Provost a new mascara ser la palabra we got a look at ourselves through the Word of God no sin emos kuvira nosotros otra vez de la palabra de Dios and there yayyyyy that's where we'll see is on the very most or progressing through progress song amen so the titled junction of large grace el teatro comedy he and Ron cadeau de Leia Gracia now brother branham talks about a junction the Mona Branham hablas Erica the own enthroned cattle he talks about junctions a lot of the times in all of his myths or a lot of his messages and mucho this was mensajes el habla cerca de los intron kados he says a junction dissonant Ron kado is a change in disposition may soon come your nd Spencer Sione it's or it's a change of time oh it soon come to the tiempo every age and I've done every time that age goes to its end telophase de que cada dia gasoline there's a junction i yoon tiempo de in the unit on cattle every time there's a certain dispensation about to end cada vez de que era dispensation Castellanos afine there's always a junction time siempre UN tiempo de intron kado now a junction oonh enthroned kado means an act of joining say a significant action they who need the state of being joined el estado they stand Unidos a place or point of meeting you are on punto de encuentro and my favorite one is in moscow burrito is the intersection of roads is AI intersection de los caminos especially when one terminates a special men Takano illness acaba so there's two roads coming to a head and twenties i those Caminos case is done in contra no and there one has to terminate you no tiene que terminada and if you go on the other end miss yvonne otro lado you'll have one road then there are un camino and both split llamo step I know why a man said even m7 porque we know that brother branham preaches so much on grace sorry musically monobrow predicate tanto de la Gracia we know that when he preached the message the message of grace sabemos cuando ella political men sake dela Gracia he showed that he was the messenger to preach grace el morro de kill a leader means accurately predict allah grants ruble lel saruba velak amen amen brother Branham says this is Amanda Branham in the message of grace elements a kalila Gracia grace is old like gracias Antigua grace is as old as the world is like resistant Antigua como es el mundo grace was first shown to the human race when he had or when we had a beginning of a human race nosotros somos un principio de la semana so grace was always in the beginning to say gracias imprisonment in principal race was always here Legree she simply stava and grace will go on until eternity comes to a head and to the lagrasta simbra Sara hasta que hagan later Nidal Abraham was given grace Abraham self with Allah grass he was given an unconditional covenants elevated impacto sin condiciones so grace was before the law in tesla Gracia era antes de la ley it was during the law era durante la Lee and it'll be afternoon here at this phase Lally amen I mean the children of Israel were in bondage no see Jose Israel is a miserable umbria tooth God gave have an unconditional covenant we all know this so sorry music ideon ideon Abram una parte Owen conditional but he said for 400 years for any hope or cuatro sin to sign young children will be living in a strange land to see who's won every intern add another extraneous and they will be slaves it's run in Surbiton Bree so so by grace is poor Gracia God gave them a profit joslin Profeta a man I mean it was by the grace of God irra por la Gracia they do says they received a prophecy very non profit and whenever the Prophet took them out of their condition eternal profit or loss Musa clara de su estado their God began to do wondrous things amongst them is cannot use commenced hacer cosas Stan maravillosa centralia they opened the Red Sea pudieran a Vreeland Morocco he gave them manna he showed him that there was water in the rock plays melodic area of an opinion but as human condition is very calm where's the conditional mana or fallen condition neutral condition kaiidas we want something to do for self-rescue nosotros para nuestra propia cuenta que vamos hacer algo we want a part Kyra mizuna party we want to work gay demos over ara you see the condition of the world today Bella condition del mundo the other way and we see that it's by human ambition even most kids for ambition Lumina that we've gone to the point we are today que hemos llegado hasta el estado donde esta Missouri we wouldn't be the greatest that work que hemos alien mas grande el morado people will try to deceive another person but achilles personas burning and yet i otra persona people want to be the greatest in the world last personas que decir lo mas Grande no maximum mundo they'll do as much as they can so that they can be that purse it is a cinema skip when para llegar I said that's a persona brother Branham says detail Amano brand but that's the fallen nature of the people cases not realistic isla del pueblo and they wanted something to do for themselves yeah you square en hacer algo para sí mismo so they accepted law instead of gray it is a sitar ooh la la yes God to make Commandments to them Padilla una voz careless Agha man Demento sprayers so that they could do something para que ellos eran algo but what does the law do rukia sillily the law brings a knowledge of sin la letra un conocimiento del picado the law will never take us out of sin la ley nunca no Saqqara del pica brother Branham says it's a policeman this alumina Brown case on como las autoridades it will always show you supervision siempre Viva most rare that you are wrong estas Arado in romans 5:20 romano Cinco maintain it says moreover the law entered there are lazy introduced that offense might abound but I kill picado Abunda see so there was already seen after Armony does ya be a pickle this president ever then God began to give Abraham covenant is your simple so that labrum loss back to when the man introduced law broken Delambre present orally of course it was the creation of God por supuesto relic like scenarios because it was God's commandments for Kira knows man de Mendoza do it was God's law it a la ley de Dios but it was because of man that wanted it a pero era por que el hombre lo Korea that it was introduced to them por eso self-represented with their sinful nature when law was presented to them cuando su natural essa Peka me no second oselas represented orale it increased the sinfulness of their sin amento el picado or el estado que camino so de su picado by taking all ignorant tamanna totally ignorant sia taking all unawares of what they were doing tomando total disco no see me into the location system an SEM opened up he a video from the very little lie that they would tell this mass spec Ingham interior cocoon Talon from the little shadiest thing that they did on de la cosa smiles malvada sospechoso de cassia it became something greater second video and algumas get it became something darker c'est combien algo mas Escudo to where it was dead a tiger at ok de la muerte for them to break these laws forgiveness Kevin tehrani slaves it it stops the sinners mouths a detainee la lingua Deepika del Picador from just define itself the Xhosa Ficano Sesame's it helps the world realize that they are guilty are you lyrical Munoz at acquaintance a kiss on cool public that's what the law does hey lo que hace la ley but the beautiful thing with the Bible says parallel more so de lo que de la biblia it acts as a schoolmaster is K is commune are you to bring us to Christ a member a train is a crystal amen you know the law can never take him to the promised land brother Berman says Elma no brandy secularly nunca lo sivappu de llevar a la tierra prometido says this in the paradox Louisiana in Manila peridot ha where in that the log could never save a sinner enters la ley nunca puede salvar on Picador as I have pointed out it could not come where means you not oh no puede therefore the promised land was represented by the day of grace it was la tierra prometida fuera presentado por el dia de gracia see he could not take them in into that journey be in earnest for the ever I say viaje sock or nada then he goes on to say continue and this here the law was all right the layest ravine it served its purpose he also proposed atoll accompli oh that's true but that the law didn't do anything for them esta bien pero ella nunca su algo para su beneficio didn't give them any grace no legionella de gracia law didn't take them over to the promised land la ley no fue lo que los llevo a litera prometida Moses represented the law blue this is Mona brung a moose a represent all Elaine and and he could never take them to the promised land he a new eso nunca los voy a llevar a la tierra prometida and one caputo by all the commandments and all the things they had to do a castle at all is Minami de todo que tienen que complete there will never be they would never be able to make it a man nunca city encompasses de poder llegar but there was a man named Joshua pero el sistema por un hombre porn Americans way that was there with Moses the whole time que todo el tiempo some moisés and it's showing that grace was with law every step of the way a Muslim Michaela Gracia simply in kind of puzzled community I'll call delay so he was there but he could not take his full ministry it is Asahi / no podía - MRSA ministerio complete until the law was fulfilled as the killer life was a completer so grace cannot take its full effect in a person's life entonces la Gracia nunca put in thread and big or complete a metal a VW until the law in your life a secular Lakes Texas Vida somwhere ax and there was a time you have young tiempo where Moses died cuando Moises mojo and their God Church - Joshua he lured Osvaldo cosmos way and he said now my servant is dead autumn is here but somewhere - now you could take the children of Israel on a bridge in varanasi to derail into the promised land a litera prometida see something had to happen we all go teeny attack on the sail in order for grace to take its effect for a kala Gracia and begorrah the law had to die la late ENIAC a marine Moses had to die Moises ENIAC a marine and once he died yeah condo Mario there was a junction right there who cementery a via ACM from Cabo it changes from Lord to great on the Gambia delay allograph they were able to take all the fruits of the promised land in from capacity to market or they lost through to the la tierra

tiene que su salera there has to be a crossroads in our lives tiene que ver un cruce de caminha una inclusive colonists Ravi de something has to die I'll go primera matatini camera in order for the other to live para que no puede vivir now that Junction was the type and just a sin to Lucado Aaron tipo it was actually a type a real material tipo of our last day they no strobe poster a Rodian we know that there was one time brother branham severe most decay and when I questioned Amano Branum he kept opening his Bible LT yeah I mean Servilia and every time he'd open it he kind of is the keel over here it kept on opening to the book of Joshua sin segi abriendo libro de Josue and there it shows as he kept on revealing to us he meant as LCG a rebel and oh no so true no most raava that his ministry they can mean he said you the end was the Ministry of Josh let me see Rio de force way so so whatever everybody has a chance just kind of color on insisting al oportunidad read that book again Lee odden Jose libro because it speaks of our day por que habla de nuestro dia presenting but it was just too tight press element Iran people we know that after Joshua sabemos que después de Josue the law still continued delay on continued ABBA it was just tight Salomon their own people it was a foreshadow era una disciple but 14 years later pero how many years fourteen hundred years later mil Contras in Tucson uses place their the junction ie L intron Cabo the real junction between law and grace el verdadero in through cavity like Leila Gracia final meeting ago and brother if you

greater than a prophecy your all's ego my your kin Profeta he was he was messenger of the covenant si él era alarum in cicchitto el mensaje Rodell part o brother Branham says this element of random he
