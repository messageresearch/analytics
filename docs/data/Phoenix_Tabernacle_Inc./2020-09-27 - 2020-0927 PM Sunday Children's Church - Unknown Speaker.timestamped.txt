[46:33] you
[46:36] no no you must give a decree
[46:40] everybody as i told you please
[46:43] all right here's a decree whenever you
[46:46] start to hear the trumpets and the
[46:48] clarinet and the sultry and the other
[46:50] music instruments whenever you hear that
[46:52] you gotta bow down like this and if you
[46:55] don't bow down
[46:57] that cool fiery furnace that you saw
[46:59] you're gonna get thrown into that right
[47:01] yeah that's the decree
[47:06] all right maestro
[47:10] [Music]
[47:17] [Applause]
[47:19] so in that day when the music started
[47:22] and the harp started playing and the
[47:23] trumpet blew and the drums went boom
[47:26] boom
[47:26] boom everybody couldn't help it
[47:31] they couldn't help it so they bent down
[47:34] like
[47:34] sometimes we'll wear fries and we hear
[47:36] that song and we're like oh
[47:38] i just came for some eggs i just came
[47:40] for some milk
[47:42] foot stop tapping
[47:45] we can't help it sometimes but you have
[47:48] to take control of this bad boy
[47:50] we have to take control of this flesh
[47:53] whenever we hear the music we can't bow
[47:55] down
[47:56] so we have to remember so who be the
[47:58] glory
[48:01] to who be the praise
[48:04] but there was three in the kingdom
[48:07] that refused to bow down
[48:11] they didn't even nod their head they
[48:13] didn't even say
[48:14] yo that's a cool beat they didn't say
[48:17] nothing
[48:18] they kept their heads straight and they
[48:20] said i'm gonna honor
[48:22] god and that was three young hebrew
[48:25] children
[48:26] by the name of shadrach meshach
[48:30] and abednego can you say shadrach
