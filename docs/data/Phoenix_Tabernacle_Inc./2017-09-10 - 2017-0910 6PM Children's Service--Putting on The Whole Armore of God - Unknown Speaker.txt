wall below your horns and shout and I will deliver them into your hand just what your soldiers are following you man oh my gosh this is a sad excuse for an army but you know what God chooses who you least expect he doesn't need a big strong soldier he wants to use you to show his glory so they marched it on the wall so much around the church that way igor go march around can we all seem justified the Battle of Jericho - Afonso that's on us - upon Samantha bottle of gin Josh so they marched around and on the common three maybe all that chocolate and everybody screamed and nothing happened so

how hard I try I just fall I fall I fall and I make mistakes and I try to get back up but I just I just live a defeated life God are you even listening what did I do wrong Lord [Music] what are you telling me father my brethren be strong in the Lord and in the power of his might put on the whole armor of God that ye may be able to stand against the wiles of the devil it's not what I did wrong

conversation in charity in spirit in faith in purity till i come give attendance to reading to exhortation to doctrine neglect the gift that is envy which was given thee by prophecy with the laying on of the hands of the presbytery meditate upon these things give thyself wholly to them that thy full profit profiting may appear to all take heed unto thyself and unto the doctrine continuing them brewing during this thou shalt both save thyself and them that hear thee okay Lori I heard you I'm ready ah [Music] [Music] I'm not if I was the son of guy wouldn't fall anymore [Music] my son can't just keep reading have not I commanded thee be strong and of good courage be not afraid neither doubt be dismayed for the Lord that God is with thee with which ever thou goest ye are of God little children and have overcome them because greater is he that is in you than he that is in the world but God commanded his love toward us in that while we were yet sinners Christ died for us [Music] I

preparation of the gospel of peace above all taking the shield of faith with reach shall be able to quench all the reports of the dial of wicked and take the helmet of salvation and the sword of spirit which is the word of God rain always with all prayer and supplication in the spirit and watching thereunto with all perseverance and supplication with all saints [Music] [Applause] [Music] hey and all these things we are more than conquerors through him that loved us for I am persuaded that neither death nor life nor Angels nor principalities nor powers nor things present nor things to come nor height nor depth nor any other creature shall be able to separate us from the love of God which is in Christ Jesus our Lord [Applause] [Applause] [Music] [Music] is our God and awesome God through
