wasn't it when um he decided not to go and he was listening to his mother-in-law's advice and it said It was though he didn't want to hurt his mother-in-law's feelings but he said that Was the worst mist he Ever made So let's Why Ok God bless you last time we completed chapter 18 and this Time we're Going To chapter 19 in the Second Book a Black curtain Falls from 1936 as If to sooth his trouble conscience William branam increases his evangelistic efforts around the jeffersonville Area feeling that The Story of his Life might Inspire others to have Faith in God Bill wrote down some of his personal experiences and Had them printed in a 15 page booklet he borrow the title from hebrews chapter 13 verse 8 Jesus Christ the same Yesterday today and forever and he signed his work by rever William Billy branam in a Forward he wrote this Book has been written so that everyone Who reads it May know that Jesus Christ is Still saving and healing people It is my belief that he is soon to appear Again this Book tells How he chose a Poor Boy And called him to his ministry and How the Boy ran from him for a While and then wholeheartedly turned to him Bill followed on the next page with A Prayer Oh Father in heaven please Bless everyone Who reads this Book Let them know that you are Going To call a mighty Church soon such as We have never seen we Still believe you create a longing in Every Heart and Oh righteous One help thy humble servant to carry on your message I know you hid Me In The Bull rushes As you did moses for some purpose so Father help me to glorify thy name for I ask it in Jesus name amen the next Seven pages highlighted bill's unusual Life beginning with How he and his mother would have Died In A snowstorm except for the intervention of a neighbor he told of the voice that spoke to him from the branches of a tree when he was Seven years old saying Don't ever drink or Smoke or defile your body in Any way there Will be a work for you to do when you get older then he mentioned his trip to Arizona in 1927 and told How the Death of his brother Edward brought him home and forced him to consider What lay Beyond his Life he wrote about Being overcome by gas While working for the public service Company his subsequent operation in theion of a Cross of light that turned him towards God then he described his own miraculous healing from a stomach disorder and severe astigmatism his call to preach and Finally the Ball of fire that appeared over his Head While baptizing in the Ohio River in 1933 he concluded the booklet with these words dear If I only Had room in this Book to Tell you of the many things that have happened of how Our tabernacle was built in many of the powerful revivals We have held people have come from Far and near to be healed but I Going To Have to make this Book small Enough so that it Will sell cheap And Be in Reach of all these things are to Let You know that Jesus Christ is Still The same as he was Yesterday and today and will be forever and that You should believe him And Be saved if you can at Any Time Our revivals are near you please attend them there followed Two pages of testimonies from people who Had been miraculously healed as a result of bill's prayers including testimonies from Mr William Merrell and mrs Mary dur ohan Who were the First two people Bill Had seen in visions Being healed before it

What was he Going To Do he would be embarrassed to go back home and Tell hope he Had forgotten but besides it would Take too much time suddenly he thought of Thelma Ford a friend of his Who worked at a nearby variety Store She could possibly Tell him What he needed To Know once through the door Bill paused in the Sporting goods section to admire his favorite 22 Caliber rifle on the rack It was a beautiful firearm perfect for squirrel hunting Bill Had Wanted to buy it for over a year but it cost $7 and he couldn't even scrape Together the $3 for the down payment Hi Billy Can I help you Hi

con una gran y hermosa sonrisa church Díganle Bienvenido a la iglesia de los niños de parte de nuestro pastor le damos la bienvenida a este servicio de niños da gusto poder verles a cada uno de ustedes y ahora pueden tomar sus lugares siempre es bonito y hermoso estar en la casa del Señor Amén estamos agradecidos con Dios por la hermosa por el hermoso clima que estamos experimentando Parece ser que ya era tiempo que nos alejamos el calor de Arizona y estamos muy agradecidos por eso Amén como ustedes ya saben los que han estado aquí seguidamente en los servicios de los niños hemos estado tocando sobre ciertos temas hemos estado hablando sobre el plan de Dios para la salvación hemos tocado el tema del bautismo del arrepentimiento hemos tocado los temas es contabilidad es nuestra responsabilidad como jovencitos delante de Dios Y cómo es que me doy cuenta sé que estas cosas me importan Entonces el día de hoy Vamos a continuar con ese temae que vamos a lado como ustedes saben la palabra de Dios es muy dinámica es algo hermoso es la cosa más sobresaliente que jamás ha existido la palabra de Dios tiene poder es poderosa y cuando sus hijos la vocean tiene el poder de crear de sanar No es eso maravilloso cualquier cosa que usted necesite si usted la cree en fe fe en él en Jesucristo él hará que suceda él cumplirá su palabra Entonces estamos muy agradecidos Por eso voy a leer una escritura si son tan amables de ponerse de bueno más bien vamos a estar leyendo varias escrituras Solamente les voy a pedir que se mantengan de pie por nuestra primera escritura libro de efesios capítulo 2 versículo 1 empecemos con el versículo un aquí en mi Biblia dice la salvación a través de la gracia y él os dio vida a vosotros cuando estabais muertos en vuestros delitos y pecados loses anduviste en otro tiempo siguiendo la corriente de este mundo conforme al príncipe de la potestad del aire el espíritu que ahora opera en los hijos de desobediencia entre los cuales también todos nosotros vivimos en otro tiempo en los deseos de nuestra carne haciendo la voluntad de la carne y de los pensamientos y éramos por naturaleza hijos de ira lo mismo que los demás pero Dios que es rico en misericordia por por su gran amor con que nos amó Aún estando muertos en pecados nos dio vida juntamente con Cristo byce por gracia sois salvos que Dios agregue su bendición a la lectura de su palabra y pueden tomar sus lugares esta escritura una escritura hermosa al oír los mensajes de nuestro pastor hay muchos mensajes en el cual él toma esta escriptura y es una escritura que yo amo es una escritura que dibuja un cuadro de lo que esra antes de venir a Cristo y es una situación bastante errada la escritura usa palabras tales como la estando muertos es una palabra espantosa Pero entonces trae luz la luz de Dios la luz de Jesús sobre la Pero y dice y nos ha dado vida a través de él no es eso maravilloso ahora estoy hablando a los niños entonces nos dice que estamos en una situación bastante mala pero aún así él ha enviado a él ha enviado a Cristo el cual es nuestro Señor y Salvador a rescatarnos de esta situación Cuántos quieren ser rescatados Hoy estaremos hablando del plan de Dios de salvación y dice Dios quiere que yo sea salvo puedes decir eso conmigo am Dios quiere quiere que yo sea salvo que yo sea salvo amen vamos a leer esta escritura que se encuentra primera de Timoteo el capítulo 2 versículos 1 al cu Bueno ahora cómo nos damos cuenta que Dios quiere que seamos salvos Bueno vamos a su escritura y allí vamos a encontrar la respuesta exorto ante todo a que se hagan rogativas orones gra todos los hbres Por los reyes y por todos los que están en eminencia para que vivamos quieta y reposadamente en toda Piedad y honestidad porque esto es bueno y agradable delante de Dios nuestro salvad el cual quiere que todos los hombres sean salvos y que vengan al conocimiento de la verdad Entonces Dios quiere que todo hombre sea salvo y que venga al conocimiento al entendimiento de la verdad no es eso maravilloso es lo que Dios desea él también desea que usted ore bueno Pues en sí no tengo por quién orar Bueno entonces cómo Cómo podemos complacer a Dios él nos dice que Oremos por toda persona que está en eminencia y en autoridad por qué Para poder tener paz en nuestras vidas en Piedad y en honestidad am dice porque esto es bueno y aceptable en los ojos de Dios Aquí Entonces nos damos cuenta que Dios quiere que todo hombre y dama sean salvos am Bendito sea el señor Entonces él quiere Él desea que todos sean salvos en el libro de Lucas capítulo 5 del 27 al 32 en esta escritura leamos después de estas cosas salió y vio a un publicano llamado Levi sentado al banco de los tributos públicos y le dijo sígueme sígueme le dijo Jesús y Leví dejándolo todo se levantó y le siguió entonces Jesús le pide Ven conmigo y él fue obediente fíjese que cuando Jesús nos llama debemos de obedecer no solamente es el Jesús de la historia en el pasado cuando le llamó a lev aú en este día le está llamando a cada uno deed [Aplausos] que acabamos de leer desea que todo hombre sea salvo Bendito sea el señor y Leví le hizo gran banquete en su casa y había mucha compañía de publicanos y de otros que estaban a la mesa con ellos y los escribas y los fariseos murmuraban contra los discípulos diciendo por coméis y bebéis con publicanos y pecadores respondiendo Jesús les dijo los que están sanos no tienen necesidad de médico sino los enfermos no he venido a llamar al justo aores al arrepentimiento ahora podemos ver que Jesús desea que todo hombre sea salvo y él vino por pecadores y él quiere que ellos hagan qué que sean salvos y se arrepientan hay esa palabra arrepentir arrepentimiento estamos aprendiendo much jes y eso es bueno sigamos Mateo 4 del 18 al 22 uno de los ejemplos que le quiero mostrares es Jesús llamándole a sus discípulos eso es un tipo Es algo similar como cuando Jesús les llama a ustedes jovencitos a ustedes jovencitas aú a cada uno de nosotros que estamos sentados aquí en esta iglesia veamos Qué fue la respuesta de los discípulos el 418 andando Jesús justo al mar junto al mar de Galilea vio a her llamado Pedro y Andrés su hermano que echaban la red en el mar Porque eran Pescadores y les dijo Venid en Pos de m y y Os haré Pescadores de hombres ellos Entonces dejando al instante sus redes le siguieron Entonces cuando nosotros sentimos que Dios nos llama debemos de poner todo a un lado y seguirle porque si no lo hacemos recuerde en el principio estábamos muertos en delitos y pecados y él nos está diciendo salgan de esa situación y Síganme hacia la vida entonces los discípulos los apóstoles le siguieron y siguiendo de allí pasando de de allí vio a otros dos hermanos Jacobo hijo de zebedeo y Juan su hermano en el en la barca con zebedeo su padre que remendaban sus redes y los llamó Oigan vengan Síganme me imagino que dijo y y ellos dejando al instante La Barca y a su padre siguieron a Jesús qué cosa es algo maravilloso hermanos vamos a la siguiente escritura Quiero leer una cita del hermano branam del mensaje bautismo en agua ahora ponga atención jovencitos br Cómo te llamas le pregunta El Hermano Branham Myers Myers responde el hermano What Myers Myers Little brother Myers Bueno aquí tenemos a este pequeñito a nuestro pequeño hermano Myers cuántos años tienes hijo 10 años hermano quizás alguien diga Bueno y por qué bautizas este jovencito Jesús dijo Dejad a los pequeñitos venir a mí y no les se lo impidáis porque de Tales es el reino de Dios Déjalos venir este pequeñito quiere ser bautizado yo creo que tuvieron que ir a agarrar ropa para para él un cambio para que se pueda bautizar él está convencido oremos padre dios creador del cielo y la tierra el autor de la vida eterna y dador de cada dádiva buena Envía tu bendición sobre este jovencito que viene a ti en esta mañana en esta tumba helada mientras que yo lo bautizo en agua llénalo con tu espíritu santo y sobre la confesión de sus pecados y sobre la confesión de su fe en el hijo de Dios te bautizo mi pequeñito hermano en el nombre del señor Jesucristo Amén entonces todo todo lo que les pertenece a los adultos también es para ustedes y es la razón por la cual aprendemos de Jesús por eso nos enseñan aquí en la escuela de los pequeñitos quizás un pequeñito se pregunte acaso yo sea muy joven para que el espíritu santo mu en mí mire si usted quiere que el espíritu santo venga a morar en usted invítale Espíritu Santo ven y a morar en mí Dios bendiga her amamos al curso que hemos tenido nuestros servicios quiero ilustrar algo y voy a tener aquí que mis ayudantes me ayuden aquí tenemos al Espíritu Santo aquí tenemos la palabra de Dios Y tenemos la palabra de Dios esta cu tenemos al mundo alcanzan a ver pero aquí tenemos la agua bastante sucia Este es el mundo Este es el mundo y su suciedad es donde nacemos lug deodo Y suciedad entonces cuando nacemos nacemos dentro de eso ahora recuerde que dijimos que éramos inocentes hasta que llegamos a entender la diferencia entre el bien y el mal no hay nada dentro de nosotros inocencia y el mal pero aún así nacemos en esa sociedad no podemos evitarlo Así es como nosotros cada uno de nosotros llegamos al mundo esta botellita de plástico Allí está flotando sobre esa suciedad Cuando llegamos a la edad en donde empezamos a entender empezamos a tomar escogencias cuando escogemos es algo sencillo quieres naranja jugo de naranja o leche escogi quieres hacer cosas buenas o malas esa es otra escogencia Cuando tenemos la habilid yam empezamos a llenarnos con el fango del mundo no lo podemos evitar sucio verdad con esto nos empezamos aen real queremos esta quiere esto Quién quiere estar lleno de esta suciedad alguien quiere echarle un traguito entonces lo que sucede es que Dios que es rico en misericordia te ve adentro y dice es ese es mi hijo y dice hijo Quieres salir and y seguirme Yes sí padre quiero seguirte and p te saca de esta suciedad de esta suciedad te saca de esta suciedad te elige así como eligió a los discípulos Así cuando él iba caminando él te elige pero estamos sucios pero él no ve la suciedad Pero hay un proceso por el cual Tenemos que pasar y ese es el plan de Dios para vuestra salvación porque su espíritu santo ahora recuerde Todos queremos que el espíritu santo mu en nosotros venir a morar en vosotros si estamos llenos de suciedad una de las cosas que tenemos que hacer es confesar nuestro pecado tenemos que arrepentirnos y decir señor estoy tan arrepentido por las cosas que hago [Aplausos] y porque yo creo en ti Tú eres el Dios Todopoderoso yo quiero que tú vengas y me salves Yo ya no quiero hacer lo malo Quiero que me llenes con tu espíritu santo entonces quizás alguien venga y pued será o hermano alej Hermano Ernesto uno de los ministros y entonces usted acepta al Señor Jesucristo como su Salvador al confesarlo el hermano bram dice ahí tengo la pantalla momento dice estos dos pequeñitos edades de seis y 8 años que estaban aquí en el altar esta mañana ahora esto se refiere a una pregunta que le preguntaron al Hermano Branham en el mensaje intitulado Dios siendo malentendido A qué edad es aconsejable de que ellos se bauticen Entonces los jovencitos de edades de de se y o estaban en el altar en la mañana confesaron sus pecados se arrepintieron y ahora le hacen la pregunta A qué edad es aconsejable que ellos sean bautizados dijo entre más pronto posible arrepiéntanse inmediatamente y sean bautizados en el nombre del señor Jesucristo ahora es la pregunta número uno yo aconsejo yo aconsejaría eso pero nos encontramos en las escrituras dice es eso escritural Bueno cuando Pedro predicó en el día de Pentecostés 3000 almas fueron salvas Y bautizadas esa vez en el señor fueron bautizados Entonces en cuanto Usted cree en el señor y le acepta como su Salvador vaya directamente a la agua y confiese allí mismo joven o viejo no importa quién sea usted dice bueno quizás estos pequeñitos estén muy jóvenes Jesús dijo Dejad a los niños venir a mí y no se los impis porque de Tales es el reino de Dios yo me yo pondría la mano sobre cualquiera niño que quiera venir al altar y ser bautizado a cualquiera edad no me importa la edad que tengan Ese es el profeta hablando am no está estimulado Bendito sea el señor tengo que tranquilizar acá entonces Dios nos saca de esa suciedad y somos bautizados amén ahora entendemos que entramos pecadores secos y salemos pecadores mojados bueno Eso quiere decir que el bautismo en agua no nos quita la suciedad de la carne pero a ver dónde está la palabra de Dios tra la palabra ábrela por favor pero en el momento que usted empieza a oír la palabra de Dios Y esa palabra le empieza a lavar y le lava y lo lava y lo talla y lo lava por dentro y por fuera y por el resto de su vida porque como Cristiano nunca vamos a dejar de oír la palabra de Dios Y esa palabra nos limpia y él asegura que estamos limpia nos santifica y una vez ya estando limpiecitos nos toma y nos pone nos coloca a un lado para servicio Y entonces acá viene el espíritu santo Dónde está el espíritu santo y empieza el espíritu santo a llenarte a llenarte con amor con paz con paciencia con gozo con con mansedumbre con benignidad y todo que fue Jesús y empieza usted a a imitar a Jesús usted empieza a hablar como Jesús usted empieza a orar por el pueblo usted empieza a manifestar las mismas obras que Jesús manifestó Por qué Porque es que ya no es el hermano alejado ya no es el otro hermano ya no es el hermano Ernesto es es Jesús viviendo en ellos manifestando las mismas obras que Jesús hizo en aquel entonces el día de hoy y es lo que tiene para cada uno de nosotros ustedes serán vasos pequeños en los cuales Dios va a morar eso está maravilloso y es solamente a través de su gracia y su misericordia no es nada que nosotros hicimos para merecer simplemente somos obedientes le seguimos somos como [Música] corderitos no es eso maravilloso es algo maravilloso Es algo grande grandioso o quizs dimos bueno es que a m me gusta laedad Dónde está toda la enfermedad adicciones muerte muerte literal mire porque una vez teniendo contacto con Jesucristo algo sucedió en el calvario Cuántos están Cuántos reconocen eso cuando Jesús vino ahora Jesús era Dios en carne falar siendo Cordero inocente él llevó todos nuestros pecados y los llevó al calvario y cuando le crucificaron él fue a la tumba y fue y se encontró con el le tocó la puerta y dijo Dame las llaves Cuáles llaves las llaves de la del infierno de la muerte las llaves puso una [Aplausos] patada para nosotros regresa a la tierra resucita servimos a un Dios poderoso tomó de nuevo Lo que ad había perdido é fue ese sacrificio perfecto hubo un joven rico un tipo bueno él está aquí Él hizo puras cosas buenas dice mientras que él caminaba por el camino uno vino a él inclinándose arrodillándose y le dice [Aplausos] maestro Qué debo hacer para heredar la vida eterna ahora si acaso usted pudiese encontrarse con Jesús y usted le dijera a Jesús mi mamá ya falleció mi abuelito ya falleció y yo no quiero morir Qué puedo hacer para ser salvo y tener vida eterna quizás él le diga algo como le dijo a este joven rico Jesús respondiendo le dice Por qué me llamas bueno no hay nadie Bueno solo uno él es Dios Bueno ya conoces los mandamientos No cometas adulterio no asesines no robes mentira no defraudes honra a tu padre y a tu madre y El joven rico le le responde y le dice maestro todas estas cosas lo he hecho desde mi juventud Yo he sido persona buena entonces Jesús viéndolo le amó y le dijo una cosa careces ve y vende todo lo que tengas y dáselo a los pobres Y entonces tendrás tesoro en el cielo y ven toma tu cruz y sígueme él nos dice a nosotros que le sigamos y él estuvo muy triste cuando oyó esto estaba triste con lo que con la respuesta de Jesús y él se fue tristemente porque tenía grandes posesiones ve jovencitos en ocasiones nuestras posesiones son de la manera que pensamos Bueno yo no puedo aceptar a Jesús porque quiero ser chido y suave en la escuela Yo no quiero cambiar yo quiero seguir así como estoy Este joven tenía grandes posesiones que él ella quería estas cosas pero aún él quería vida eterna pero él no estaba dispuesto a seguir a Jesús y a obedecerle recuerde nosotros tenemos que escoger tenemos que hacer la escogencia de darle la espalda a todas aquellas las cosas que son contra la palabra de Dios se mete uno a la computadora quizás Ver cosas con nuestros ojos que no debemos quizás no queremos dejar eso esas cosas que vemos y oímos esas cosas no más empeoran llegan a ser adicciones no no no yo yo yo controlo esto y sabe una cosa esta esta agua este lodo se convierte en concreto en cemento y lo empieza a inmovilizar y antes de lo que antes que se dé cuenta no tiene control usted ahora si sucede esto la única cosa que tiene que hacer usted es clamar a él y decir padre estoy tan arrepentido estoy tan arrepentido que no Oy tu llamado Yo ya no quiero vivir en esa sociedad quiero ser obediente a tu palabra quiero seguirte Yo sé que no voy a ser perfecto pero tú eres mi perfección a través de tu palabra a través de tu amor misericordia Tú harás la obra no importa la edad que tenga y yo no quiero vivir así Señor yo no quiero vivir así Yo sé que no soy perfecto pero ya no quiero vivir así Yo no quiero que otra cosa me controle yo quiero que tú me controles yo no quiero que el alcohol las drogas o programas incorrectos en televisión o música de rap o música roquera toda esta otra basura yo no quiero que nada de eso me controle porque yo sé que Jesús tú quieres un vaso limpio y que cuando tú vengas Yo quiero asegurar que mi casa mi corazón es quiero hablar de los hermanos quiero orar por los hermanos yo te
