========================================
[Music] so [Music] in the hands of the lord [Music] to come to this place once more this puerto [Music] and please help us keep going [Music] please bless us this evening with this message that each and every one of us has [Music] [Music] [Music] tonight we will be listening listening to to the message apostolic stewardship number four preached by our pastor bernie g garcia on july 18 1984 this is a bilingual message interpreted by brother ernesto berunda senior may the lord richly bless you through [Music] [Music] so that we can have fellowship one with another around god's word [Music] elementary mighty [Music] [Music] not trying to attack anybody nita [Music] my only intention is to share with you what god has given me to be so kind [Music] let's open up our scriptures to malachi chapter 3 [Music] will a man rob god yet you have robbed me but you say we're in here we rob thee in tithes and offerings [Music] father we thank you and now we ask you that you bless your word that it may be a revelation [Music] i ask you in the name of the lord jesus christ amen the friends and [Music] i have not studied a lot in spanish but when i do study i have to compare the english to the spanish and vice versa [Music] remember that i said a few days ago that uh the first fruits were not of we've been seeing lately that the first fruits does belong to god thirty-five and to bring the first fruits of our ground and the first fruits of all fruit of all trees year by year unto the house of the lord and also the firstborn as it is [Music] herds and of our flocks to bring to the house of our god or to the priests that minister in the house of our god i'd like for us to before we go any further we'd like to see how the word reads in spanish in spanish when i read it in english with the first one from the firstborn firstborn translating it from the english [Music] the firstborn [Music] the firstborn is the primogenitor or the firstborn it is a of all the fruit of the trees and of the firstborn they had to be brought to the priests that were ministering in the house of god it says as [Music] [Music] let's look at exodus 13 verse 2. [Music] the lord jehovah's speaking to moses like this matrix in the firstborn whatsoever open at the womb among the children of israel both of man of the beast it is mine here speaking of the first one that comes out of the womb or the one that opens the womb [Music] or rupturing an opening first foreign [Music] [Music] remember we read a few minutes ago that nehemiah said of the firstborn first fruits of god as it is written in the law remember that i said a few minutes ago that people said well that's of the law numero number 313 [Music] because all the first born are mine are mine for on the day that i smoked all the firstborn in the land of egypt unto me all the firstborn in israel the animals both men and beasts [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] the lord speaking to moses and aaron in the land of egypt saying de los it shall be the first month of the year to you know notice the one that [Music] of the year scripturally born at home let's look at verse 12 [Music] i will pass through the land of egypt this night and will smite all the firstborn in the land of egypt both men and beasts [Music] and against all the gods of egypt i will execute judgment i am the lord [Music] every firstborn the first fruits it's all mine and that must be sanctified in the message order in doctrine page 483 the prophet says what is a birthright this holy spirit is your birthright in terms of that so if i understand if i'm wrong but if i understand correctly the word he says the holy spirit is your birthright in other words when you're born then you have all right and that right is to have the holy ghost the holy ghost should be the most important thing to you then everything else there is in the world more than your prestige your not [Music] deuteronomy 6 verse 4 o israel the lord our god is one lord speak unto aaron and to his sons and unto all the children and say unto them whatsoever he be of the house of israel or of the strangers in israel that will offer his oblation for all his vows or for all his free will offerings which they will offer unto the lord for a burnt offering of you shall offer at your own will a male without blemish of the beasts of the sheep or of the goats is it going to be voluntarily or by force now let's look at first corinthians once again this is faith chapter 16 and verse 2. from the first day of the week [Music] on the first day of the week when the disciples came together to break bread paul preached unto them ready to depart on the morrow and continued his speech until midnight so disciples even gathered together on the first day of the week who got together the disciples a disciple is one that followed us and who is our master blemish that shall ye not work for it shall not be acceptable for you see whatever had a spot on it could not be brought [Music] and whosoever offers the sacrifice of peace offerings unto the lord to accomplish his vow voluntarily for a free will offering in thieves or sheep it shall be perfect to be accepted there shall be no blemish therein blind or broken [Music] superfluous or lacking his parts that that that may establish for a free will offering but for a bow it shall not be accepted you shall not offer unto the lord that which is bruised or crushed or broken or cut neither shall you make any offering thereof in your land neither from a stranger's hand shall you offer the bread of your god of any of these things they shall not be accepted for there is corruption there is corruption in them any animal that had a blemish [Music] blind or maimed anything similar no and when the sabbath was passed mary magdalene and mary the mother of james and salome had bought sweet spices and they might come and anoint him yeah and very early in the morning at the first day of the week they came upon the sepulcher at the rising of the sun when did they come in what day of the week was what is the first day of the week domingo sandy it's about 9 30 10 o'clock in the morning cleaning the cobwebs from their eyes is that right the blood of the lord that's the first fruit of yours he comes before everything else and it has to come out from here the deepest part of your heart how much is it bro but then i do make a sacrifice and i go on and buy a car give two hundred dollars a month of a car payment i get my check the and you know and the first beginning of the week you give to god first the first horror the best in tongues how many of you believe that jesus christ is the same yesterday today and forever i believe that also how many of you believe that jesus lives there are you sure [Music] let's ride it down like this yesterday this was 2 000 years ago because when that today [Music] but the reason that we keep sunday is a memorial of the resurrection you should say the reason why we keep sunday is because it's a memorial of the resurrection the roman catholic did that they claimed that they did that for they met on the first day of the week for their worship when did they get together amen is that right did they get together who gathered the disciples is that right [Music] you could tell this tell between a christian jew judeo orthodox and an orthodox jew they both went to synagogues but one went on saturday because they don't believe that jesus christ [Music] if you don't gather the brother and i were talking and uh he didn't wasn't following it right away because maybe he didn't understand it was buried i said lord i thank you because you in this day have proven to us yesterday today and foreign he's always been alive divided up into three different dispensations the restoration of the bike tree page 63. i get a lot of quotes for you but this is just one so you can see what was the third day nothing in the third day nothing on the second day and in the third day dispensation of the holy ghost is the dead forms went on till they got to pentecost then began to rumor around that he that's jesus [Music] but in those days where are you you haven't received that's to go over and play basketball but they do it because they [Applause] [Music] if it's uh stained or blemished for example you open up the doors and a couple of kids come in here running up and down the aisle they have grief they come into the service and every service they go outside every service what business do they have going on no matter where when do you enter when i'm gonna go in before i come here to the platform you know how many times i go to the restroom maybe seven or eight times i go to the restroom i better has [Music] [Music] what can they give to me no nothing about it they can't give me nothing all means but william brandon the messenger came here and he said denominational rivers guerrero de hombre created jesus the first day of the month became redemption i'm going to finish off with this woman the first first husband died her second husband died and they wouldn't give him the the next one that would get out the third son then she dressed up as a harlot and her father [Music] foreign is is were the disciples the first day of the week on the sunday one day where were they gathered together together let us pray i thank you lord your words [Music]
