bilingual message interpreted by Brother Ernest J burunda may the Lord richly bless you amen amen I greet each and every one of you in the precious name of our Lord Jesus Christ we welcome each one of you so happy to have brother with us also brother Dominguez welcome them to the Tabernacle if you would open up your Bibles to Romans 8 verse 19 this is to continue on the subject of the letter to the Romans number 2 this is the eighth message that I have now on the manifestation of the sons of God for the earnest expectation of the creature waits for the manifestation of the sons of God now Matthew [Music] 17 for after six days Jesus Takes Peter James and John his brother and bringeth them up into a high mountain theart was transfigured before them and his face shine as the sun and his rment was white as the light and behold there appeared unto them Moses and Elias talking with him then answered Peter and said unto Jesus Lord it is good for us to be here if thou wil let us make here three Tabernacles one for thee one for Moses one for Elias while he yet spake Behold a bright Cloud overshadowed them and behold the voice out of the cloud which said this is my beloved Son in whom I am well pleased hear ye himy now Revelation 41 after this I looked and behold a door was opened in heaven and the first voice which I heard as it were of a trumpet talking with me which said come up hither and I will show you the things which must be Hereafter let us PR father I present each person here along with us in your hands that you might be the one that takes control of everything and as your servant I take control over every spirit this morning and that you might permit that the word flow freely just as you have given it to me that which you have given to me of this message of the hour what is the benefit the placing in the growth of each one of your children we ask it in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ amen once again I want to recognize everyone visiting us this morning want to say that being that we're have a series that I'm speaking on it's hard for you to understand me I've been noting something ever since I started this series I've been pointing towards something since I started the Lord permits I want to get to it today I want to say this that I'm not saying it for to about anyone individual but I want to do it because that's what God has given us the message that has been given to us is a beautiful message brother bam has taught us you can't preach any higher than what you live I believe we have lived or we're going to be speaking on this morning how many were here last Sunday would you raise your hand you should understand very well we're going to be putting on a transparency here that of the pyramid pyramid along with the Caps pyramid itself has seven part to is seven steps going up and the eighth part is a is a pyramid to itself it's a headstone that's placed upon every pyramid we have proven through the message and the and the Bible that the pyramid is a Church of the Living God and at the same time it's each individual the church has to have the headstone in order to be sealed and each individual needs a headstone to be sealed we've seen that the fifth age the age to which Martin Luther was a messenger that's the beginning of the return again of the wheat plant that's the age that produced the stock that's the fifth agey then the sixth age Wesley's Age We proved that that was the age that produced the tassel then the seventh age is thean church age that's that produces the shook then the fourth step which brings the seed the grain we prove that that grain is formed outside of the three [Music] steps it's separate from the three three steps is not part of it it's outside of the three steps that's the eighth step or just to return back to the beginning again that's what I want to be speaking on a little bit about The Headstone that's the age that we're present in you can write all these things down if you so desire even though we already mentioned it last Sunday it's the head age headstone age it's the age of the eye it's a bride age it's the wheat age it's the age of the grain it's the word Age It's a Great Seal age it's Ephesians once again and in order for you to understand what an Ephesians is Ephesians parallels Joshua the Book of Joshua is the placing of the people of Israel in their Homeland so we're now in this age in the time of the placing of God's children if you understand so far say Amen for benefit of those who don't know me when I ask you do you understand me I'm not asking if you believe just trying to see if you understand what I'm trying to say there's no benefit to teach something if it's not being understood so let's repeat all together as a class the fifth age is of which part of the wheat plant the young men here don't anyone answer just those in the front I think they should know the message can't benefit if we're not a part of the [Laughter] matter W AG which is the sixth part what part of the is it to they say is that right are they right you have to take part in it too Church age is what part of the pl wheat plant number three what is the third part it's a shock besides this age out Beyond these age is that what the fourth part forms which is the wheat it's a grain it's the word it's outside now this is a question please don't answer just ask ask to yourself the head is a a head part of the body just for you to think about it of course the head is part of the body that's the top part where the brain is which that which moves the body that's the age we're in now this is the wheat plant first part was the stock second part was the tassel third was a shock now the question is this those that form part of this plan those genuine lutherans methodists Pentecostals will they go in the Rapture or no yes or no amen amen and then the fourth part is the grain the word adoption time we're living in adoption time for there to be adoption in order to have be an adoption there must be a maturity a rip a growing and a ripening there must be an approval once the thing reaches its spot then comes a placing of a son then [Music] actually we're in a placing time that's plac locating placing God's Sons actually we're living in a very beautiful time and we've read these three scriptures we've spoken up to what we said so far if you understand say Amen here we are with the pyramid a mountain we've seen how Jesus God was take Jesus Took uh was taken by God up to a great high mountain and Jesus Took along with him three disciples this is called the mount Transfiguration that is a changing from one form to another form we've spoken that how when this took place we see how Peter one of three Tabernacles to be built to that Revelation that had been given Tabernacle for Moses another one for Elijah then another one for Jesus when this happened there was came a cloud that overshadowed them and when that cloud covered them the father took a couple of backward steps said this is my beloved Son here ye him in other words he's the one that's speaking in itself this begins to a a new age pointing to actually what is the day of the the son day because actually the office of a son is not Eternal being that God father being god father he took the form of a man took the body of a man and lived as a son to redeem a son to bring to bring a day a call they call a son day that calls it Christ Christ day when the son will be glorified that's how when Jesus he answered them what he answered when the wise men came to see Jesus these Greeks said we we would see Jesus we would see him we want to know who he is he said to them he said to him except a grain of sweat die the die it abides alone abides alone but you know if it falls and it dies and it falls into the ground it'll bring forth much fruit right there that's when a thunder came he said father glorify thy son glorify your name the voice came down and said I have both glorified it and are glorify it again the prophet said if he glorified him then notice how there was a thunder there what about when the church is glorified because the B will also have to be glorified because actually that's the sun day the prophet said that Jesus Victory or God's Victory actually we are his victory when actually when he is glorified so this time that we're living in we have seen tremendous things for example 1963 the cloud came down there were seven angels when the Seven Angels Came Down they came from eternity and in itself they formed what is called the pillar of cloud the pillar of Fire the Rock of Ages and up into this rock man called William was picked up into it we see how how how this man was placed in the scriptures placed as a great and that before Joshua would be placed a stone so that no one could miss it that the great Joshua that the Bible's talking about that the Holy Spirit would use as a vessel to bring the message that he would Place God's people for nothing less than man called William so so that no one could miss that so that's the message of the hour with that's the message been placed in our hands can you say Amen so I'd like to start to read a few quotes to prove what we're trying to say to you are you happy do you love the Lord do you want all the word I'm going to start reading from the message Blasphemous names page 23 I'd like to clear up that I'm not going to be referring too much of what I'm reading until I get way to the end of the message and the reason is because time does not permit but I want to let it recorded on table the message so those that want to study can go study Blasphemous names the Holy Spirit seals you in with Christ then you become one you become one see you and Christ live together at that day you'll know that I in the Father the father in me I in you you and you in [Music] me see then that's a sealed unit of the Lord God now and then they are Vindicated and placed when that takes place they become Vindicated Sons and Daughters of God page 23 24 see a family a family when and a son is born into it it's a son [Music] then but that son had tutors to raise [Applause] it and if that son never did come to be the right kind of a son he never become Heir but if he was the right son and the son that would obey his father then that son was [Music] adopted or placed positionally he become air of what the father had page 24 and that's what God was doing on Mount Transfiguration when he took his own son after he had been proven to be the right son see and had stood all Temptations He took him up on M Transfiguration and overshadowed him you know in the Old Testament they took a son dressed him in in a nice pretty garment and set him out before the public and they had a ceremony of placing or we call it a adopting Now by placing a son in other words the son was a son when he was born there's where our Pentecostal people made their [Laughter] mistake being born into the family by the Holy Ghost that's right but then we must be the right kind of children tutored by the right tutor page 25 now when Jesus had been obedient Jesus to God God placed him positionally this is he this is [Laughter] [Music] [Music] [Laughter] him he now when the member is born by the Holy Ghost into the family of God and has proven to have these this virtues in him then God can see virtue knowledge Temperance patience brotherly kindness and godliness in him then God seals him or places him and there that's when you see the Sons and Daughters of God Amen brother man says that's where the Pentecostals make their mistake I'd like to call your attention to that I've been now 17 years been preaching this message and I'm still preaching the same thing I preached 17 years ago I want you to notice one thing is to be born when you're placed now here in faith you've already been born is that right now notice take note make a not of that and check it out remember you are responsible to check me out and that's the biggest disgrace The Misfortune that has come to me that the people don't check out what I say and then any kind of new fight comes along and he moves you someone thinks [Music] he I given you enough material for you to go check it out for you to make sure that it's the message that it's God's mouth that has spoken what I'm repeating the prophet says this is not page 25 of Blasphemous names now when a member is born by the the Holy Ghost into the family the family of God and has proven to have this virtues in him then God can see virtue knowledge Temperance patience brotherly kindness and godliness so where is Faith why didn't he Place Faith there did he forget Faith because when he's born when a child is born he's automatically he's got faith he's been placed in the foundation he's already gone through three steps justification sanctification New Birth by the Holy Ghost not the Seal of the Holy not the Seal of the Holy Ghost the birth of a son is that right that's where I've been fought and they're still fighting me and they're going to fight me till the end but one day they're going to to find out that is one thing is to be born and the other thing is to be placed positionally as a son and that son that daughter God vindicates those are God's children so then we have read now how God places the son there non Transfiguration when he places the office of son the sunship the son I'll repeat it again Matthew [Music] 17 is when God places the son it's not Transfiguration when God raises to the surface the sunship or the office of a son if you not that if you believe it but if you understand me say Amen for us to be able to understand the day that we're living in you can hear that even nature is groaning people say I wish I could hear nature crying out he's got ears he wants to hear just take the newspaper earthquake in Mexico City hurricane in New York flood in Puerto Rico what is it nature is groaning crying out yelling all creation is groaning what I hear is sons of God be sons of God so that you can be placed so that Deliverance can come because it all depends on each and every one of us being placed in our position can you say Amen now there's a [Music] question must be answered in order to understand the day that we're living in we understand that God used a vessel man called William brandom he became God's mouth he brought God's thoughts to us so we could express those thoughts God thoughts can you say amen I don't want to get into that neither do I want to preach because I did not forget what I want to bring but in order to understand that we must answer a qu answer the question that was asked of brother BR and the seals page 494 and I'm giving you the pages the pages are in English reading to you directly everything I read to you I'm reading directly from the English question is will the bride of Christ have a Ministry before the Rapture sure that's what's going on right now the bride of Christ certainly it is the message of the hour the of Christ sure she consists of Apostles prophets teachers evangelists and pastors is that right brother please write the word Apostle beneath Apostles write Prophet beneath Prophet right teacher underneath teachers put evangelist and under evangelist write Pastor evangelist the brother Ram he should have now Apostle Prophet teacher evangelist Pastor now if I ask these young men that are here in the front from brother to brother please answer please raise your hand and answer how many are there in the apostleship one is that right I can't hear you is there a teacher here somewhere a public school teacher of a public school brother Romo if I say apost how many am I referring to Prophet how many referring to if I say teacher what evangelist how many am I referring to if I say Pastor how many am I referring to that's what I wanted you to answer now on the site here write Apostles prophets maos teachers evangelistas evangelists pastores pastors brother stand please if you read this Apostles prophets teachers evangelists pastors that's singular or plural what does plural mean many plural many so brother bam is speaking says the message of the hour the bride of Christ sure she consists of Apostles plur more than one many you believe of the hour is that right prophets more than one teachers more than one evangelists plural many pastors more than one thank you if you understood say Amen because many people say well brother bham is my pastor but the Bible speaks about pastors I respect brother B position I've always done so but this is just to shake you up a little bit let's say you're going to get married let's call brother to come marry you let's say you died let's call Brother bam to come bury you you got a problem it's called brother brandham that'd be absurd be ridiculous and he knew that there would be that Spirit there that's why say pastors now I continue reading like brothera says continue reading we're going to continue reading seal is that right that's the bride of Christ sure she's got a Ministry a great ministry the ministry of the hour it will be so humble it is so humble it goes over the people's head it's the ministry of the hour in the bread of Christ conduct order and Doctrine page 203 well you say well glory to God the Bible said when the Holy Ghost has come you don't need any teacher he's the teacher himself oh brother how can you be so low from reading the scripture why did the Holy Ghost set teachers in the church you say say I don't have to have anybody teach me the Holy Ghost teaches me it does through a teacher he sent Church teachers in the church can you say Amen message respect for God's servants preach Jeffersonville October 15 [Music] 1961 if you can't respect the man respect the office he holds in God respect him if a minister comes up your pastor always respect him I've heard congregations talk about their Pastor how they just talk run him down and ridicule him how is that Pastor ever going to do anything for you he can't do it you notice if you run your pastor down ridicule him and so forth he cannot help you you know why he cannot help you that's what God's mouth said that he can't help you why because you don't respect him you talk about him you say what you feel like saying about him he can't help you how many of you can say amen that's is why I want to hear another amen now believe we're going to have to ask for the brothers to bring to bring a picture of water give you a drink so you won't whistle won't be so dry that was a little better wasn't it trust it comes from the heart Prophet says you've got to love your pastor you've got to know he's a human being I believe sincerely that the people believe people forget that the pastor is a human being did you know that a lot of people if they don't curse me to my face they'll curse me to my assistant my helper they curse my assistant Cur my assistant right his face they forget you're only human let say I get up 6 7 o'clock in the morning I'm in my office there I am till 10 11 at night how many hours is that from 700 in the morning to 10 at night there 16 hours is that right that's Monday to Friday and Saturday I try to study a little bit by Sunday I'm kind of crazy then the people get mad then they say step aside I'm gonna speak to Bernie whether he likes it or not they just don't understand that I'm human I'll tell you I I'll let anyone I'll give anyone everything what ever have OB pained just to follow me for 30 days not for a year 30 days from Sun up in the morning till the next day but I'm only human now I'll continue here you've got to know he's a human being the Holy Ghost has made him Bishop overseer okay no Spanish Bible says Bishop English overseer would you write down for me brother I need for you to help me yes brother yes when you I write down the word over over overse the Holy Ghost has made him over who has made him overseer the Holy Ghost has made him overseer the word overseer is a a composed word which comes from two different words over andere and seere is somebody who can see is that right I I I showed you in the message that I preached that when the Fulfillment of of the scripture when God spoke through the mouth of Moses I will raise a prophet like unto thee I told you that that was the Lord Jesus Christ is that correct I showed you that it is Jesus speaking in this day because it was Jesus who brought the child who brought the word and the word comes to the prophets is that right I told that we were prophets here someone who can see somebody who's got prophetical protic see the high things prophesied but even though they can see someone over them and the Holy Spirit Holy Ghost put an overseer over them just stay there brother okay until I finish okay the Holy Ghost has made him o overseer and You' got to respect them in that manner and no matter what the pastor has done if you if you respect him in your heart as God servant God will respect you for doing it he that receives me receives him that sent me Jesus said God demands respect for his servants then as you respect that servant respect God you don't respect his servant you do not respect God you don't respect God doesn't respect you the Lord now the revelation of Jesus Christ to tie it together page 157 you got a pastor that really tells you the truth you ought to honor God and stay in the spirit Mark me down there stay in the spirit you got a pastor that really tells you the truth you ought to honor God and stay in the spirit and worship God realizing that you're going to be lost if you don't you're lost L you do it now this is Brother bham speaking this is not brother Bernie speaking he says you have to honor God and stay in the spirit what does that mean brother to stay in the spirit you can't stay in the spirit if you don't honor him because it was the Holy Ghost that plac him as supervisor of over overlooking the you get out of the spirit and you don't honor God when you don't honor God's servant okay over Das what is an overseer a friend selected to manage the Pastoral work of a congregation to which he belongs that's one of the [Music] reasons why I have not placed pastors I could have placed pastors throughout Latin America we would have had Latin America controlled but I never did it never done it because I don't believe such I believe that one should raise up from a from the congregation a friend and that friend is selected to manage the Pastoral work of a congregation manager it's a manager but you know that the natural types of spiritual they throw the temper over here and the fits over there man the manager says you play Third Base now forget it Third Base nothing ball game comes and John do didn't show up have you noticed that this day because they want to have the manager as a puppet but the manager's place to manage the team amen is that right amen amen now overseer okay overseer overseer is a superintendent he's a supervisor one that supervises such a person having Authority delegated by an employer to hire transf ER suspend recall promote assign or to discharge another employee or to recommend such action I want you to Mark me down these words okay and and I haven't got time I'm not even halfway to my message I haven't got time to finish my message but I want you to mark this down okay a supervisor supervisor has the authority number one to hire number two to to transfer to suspend to recall are you okay after now recall promote assign or discharge man that's that's rough huh no wonder that people don't want to have a pastor look it up in the dictionary now what does the word revoke mean call if someone you place in a job for example mayor of the city and then he's recalled take away his office isn't it true that more sometime more than four walk around with the head cast down it's kicking around I was this and they they put me off to one side the supervisor the superintendent is a pastor he has the authority authorization to hire transfer suspend recall promote assign or discharge any other employee employed by the same boss is that right so then the pastor he's a trustee a trustee is one to whom something is entrusted and the Holy Ghost has entrusted the pastor The Souls of all of those have been purchased by the blood of Christ then he entrusts the pastor gives trust to the pastor these sheep almost all the smiles are gone I'm going to take a little bit longer what age are we living in in the Rapture message for December 1965 page 31 Luther could bring nothing but sprigs these others could bring these other things these others could bring these other things we're in the TW age page [Music] 13 no le shall be in the entire seven days and even what is eat today don't try to keep it for tomorrow burn it with fire before the daylight comes that's we break we burn bread Before Sunrise when we take comunion the bread is let we burn it because it's a Time see it's a time there's a new message coming coming forth a new thing see try to hold it over but that's been the attitude of the church Ral Goes Forth Revival Goes Forth first thing you know within about three years they start an organization over it the denomination starts an organization but have you noticed this has been sing for 20 years now there's no organization and there never will be the wheat's come back this is the end the Wheats come back to the wheat again the Wheats come back to the grain the shook has pulled away from it and the wheat must in the presence of the son to be ripened leadership December 1965 see and then the first thing you know that life left the stock and went into the tassel left the St to go into the into the shock and leaves the shark and goes into the wheat three stages see of it and then forms a wheat outside of the three stages Luther Wesley Pentecost just exactly see there's no doubt you can't interrupt nature page didn't Jesus say in the last days Matthew 24:24 the two would be so close it would deceive the very genes predestinated the elect the elected one if it was possible almost like the real thing see in so in the last days now you see it's the wheat time now it's getting Harvest Time this is not Luther's age this is not the Pentecost age this is the bride age God's only provided place of worship November 65 page [Music] 15 if I brought you a Methodist message it would take no effect on you this is the bright time if Moses taught message of Noah it would take no effect if Jesus taught Moses message it would take no effect because the predestinated seed laying there SE that that will only be watered by the type of water that's GI for that seed see it won't grow any other condition it must be the condition that grows it modern events December 6 19 1965 page 10 we're not living in the Pentecost age we're living in the another age we're not living in the Methodist age we're living in another age we're living on up here in the bright age the calling out of the church and getting it together for the Rapture that's the age we're now living future home of the Bride page page 69 yes become a part of the word a part of the word of today you can't be a part of the word of Moses day that part's done made that part that may that was a feet part we're at the head now this is Christ not the arms back in Luther no this is the head time Christ the head comes to the body this is the last I'm going to say now I just read it so it could be recorded so that someone might say oh that Garcia or ber was just forming out of the mouth for him to know that that's a message of brother BR brought us stay there in the message Christ is a mystery Christ is revealed in his own word 22 August of 1965 number 1 two and give enough space to write in using God's word there is three things that you must not do now number one now you must not misinterpret the word word interpret the word you must not misplace the word misplace the word and you must not dislocate the word okay I'm going to go right back I'm going to go back you must not misinterpret the word you must not misplace the word you must not dislocate the word can you say Amen to that can you say Amen now now now my question is this show me the word you say right here the lutherans have this and what did the lutherans produce Luther what do they produce what do the Baptist produce a million more in 44 and they produce more more Baptist but the word head stone brain come back and what has It produced the word of God is that right okay hold on [Music] message what we are here for preach 1964 in June the true Born Again Church of this hour is the Living Word of God it's the Living Word of God it's the word of this age made manif now that's different to what the people believe now right be careful don't tou don't misin the word don't mislocate it don't dislocate it here's the word right here I'll repeat it the true Born Again Church of this hour is the Living Word of God [Music] is the word of this age made manifest in using God's word how can you use this how can you use this the only way you can use this in using God's word don't misinterpret it don't misplace it so you can understand so it won't go away you forgive I won't do this again a woman belongs where her right place where does a woman belong brother said says in the kitchen behind her husband don't get out of your place that's dislocating the [Music] word an overseer a super superintendent he'll assign someone to go to such and such a place to witness about Christ he comes back and if he's not careful he wants to get right run right rough shot on the pastor's neck he doesn't know his place he wants to misplace himself when the Holy Ghost place the pastor there in that place don't mislocate yourself many people say many people say forgive me brother I have to say it people say I would never do that I would never mislocate I would never get put myself in a place where I don't belong and I believe that that's right what you're saying but one thing it's mislocate thing is to dislocate and many of you you dislocate yourself manager says the pastor so you can understand do this no want to go say don't you do it and they don't do it they dislocate position three things you must not do brother you direct the service tonight brother no I'm not going to direct it you preach I'm not going to preach what are you doing dislocating word of God Living Word of God what time are we living in now faing age you forgive me but that's what has happened that's what there's no no Resurrection yet that's there's no Rapture yet no one wants to stay in their place they want to get in someone else's place another place or they want to get out of their place brother says I understand that I'm not going to mislocate something refering about you you you you're the word that I'm referring to I'm not refer to this word you I'm not going to mislocate myself I'm not going to mislocate the word now for this quote here more than 500 quotes I've got regarding to the same thing you must become flesh of his flesh B of his bone Spirit of his Spirit the same grain of fruit there was in this age that we're living in now we are the word of God say I'm not going to mislocate myself I'm not going to dislocate but there's something else don't misinterpret the word how am I going to misinterpret it I've got to get personal here the word here's the word before you you say brother you believe you're the word yes sir I believe I'm part of that word of the hour my grandchild son had more Revelation my my grandson someone said about something about television said grandfather Grandpa come my my grandson said I didn't put these words in his mouth I don't think his parents did either he said no not my grandfather my grandfather is the word made flesh went up to one side he took a tape a brother Bram he put it on to play and he came over and said there is there grandfather but since it's my life the people misinterpret the word a young boy told me a man he wrote to me he said you're a great servant of God what but harms you those around around you surround you those are ones that hurt you and I told him answer the man not the ones that surround me that the hand harming me Jesus Christ was surrounded by 70
