we will pick up where we left off in our reading of the series of books called supernatural the life of William Branham we're in book three the man in his commissioned 1946 to 1950 written by Oren Jorgenson before we get started just to let you know we're in chapter 32 the title was challenging insanity we know brother Brandon went up against many difficult spirits in his lifetime what you're about to hear is a third of the chapter that's very intense but you what I'd like for our young people to focus on here is that not that you'll find yourself in similar situations but obviously they're going to be times in your lifetime and when you're very young you're going to run up against some very difficult people in spirits pay close attention to how brother Brandon manages the situation and and we hope that it will be a blessing and we'll pick up right now before we get started I need to explain to brother Brennan is in this third stop of series of services and that were being conducted in Arkansas he started in Camden he went on to Fort Smith and then to Little Rock and at this particular point he's in Little Rock he had been praying for several hours for the sick that night after several hours of constant prayer for the sick Reverend Brown said brother Branham let me know when you need a little breather I want to show you something in the basement of the auditorium it's a case like you've never seen before tired from the strain bill welcomed the excuse to rest his mind a little while I'm ready for a break now he said while the people in the prayer line kept their places and waited Reverend Brown led bill to the basement where they met a young man standing on the bottom step of the stairway he looked like a typical Arkansas farmer dressed in a faded blue shirt and bib overalls the man gazed out across the basement with glassy dejected eyes bill looked also and was shocked by what he saw and all his life bill had never seen anything like this in the center of a large room sprawled on a bare floor was a large muscular woman dressed in a white t-shirt and black shorts bill guests she must be 30 or 35 years old she lay on her back with her legs and arms sticking straight up in the air her legs were smeared with blood from numerous cuts looking back at the man on the steps bill asked incredibly brother is that your wife yes brother branham my what is her trouble when she had her last baby the doctor thinks it threw her into premature menopause he gave her some shots but they didn't set right and she went wild she's been an insane institution for two years I sold my farm to get enough money to help her but nothing the doctor has tried has worked brother branham I've got four children at home when I heard about an insane woman from Mississippi who was healed in your meetings the other night I sold my mule to get enough money to bring my wife here in an ambulance while her legs bleeding the Institute said we could take her for just one night but when they tried to put her in the ambulance they couldn't do it so I took four brothers from my church with me and we managed to get her in a car then on the way here all four of those men couldn't hold her still and she kicked all the glass out of the backseat when we brought her into the building she just threw us everywhere finally we got her into the basement and later on her bag she just stayed there like that with her hands and legs up in the air with Penny bill looked at the insane woman lying on her back in the center of the floor her bloody arms and legs sticking straight up in the air bill sent to her husband I'll walk up and hold her hand and see if I can feel any vibrations Tara leaped into the man's eyes brother branham don't you go over there she'll kill you ignoring the warning bill strolled over to the insane woman who watched his approach with intense calculating eyes good evening bill said reaching out towards her right hand just as his hand was circling her wrist she suddenly flipped her palm over and gripped his wrist instead giving him a sharp powerful tug that nearly pulled him off his feet she could not have weighed over 170 pounds but she seemed to possess four times the strength of an average woman as she drew him down close to her bill feared she would break his bones he jerked his foot up caught her across her chest and kicked hard his hand came free and he ran back to the basement steps the insane woman pursued him still on her back slithering her body rapidly across the concrete floor looking like a giant snake all the while making inhuman gurgling noises halfway to the steps she changed her direction and headed instead for a wooden bench sitting up against the wall she struck the corner of that bench so hard with her head that the wood splintered into pieces blood mingled with her hair she picked up a chunk of wood and threw it at her husband missing him by inches and knocking plaster off the wall behind him brother branham the husband saw is there any hope for her look brother said bill putting his arm over the man's shoulder the only thing I know to tell you when that angel met me he told me that if I would be sincere and could get people to believe then he would heal the sick do you have the simple faith to believe that Jesus Christ the Son of God cast out devils mustering his courage the man answered I do when the possessed woman heard this she screeched william branham you haven't got anything to do with me I brought her here then the woman began crowing on her back towards Bill what's this the husband asked very surprised that woman doesn't even know her own name she hasn't spoken a word in two years that wasn't her CID bill that was the demon who is holding her in his possession he knows he's going to have to leave the woman if you will believe the Lord Jesus Christ right now let's agree in prayer the woman screeched again you have nothing to do with me as built bowed his head and pray Heavenly Father in the name of your son Jesus Christ make that double leave her the woman fell silent in the next moment she collapsed a flat on the floor as though lifeless her husband asked what should I do now as soon as the service is over take her back to the institution if you will believe it has got to happen let me know how it turns out god bless you god bless

I'm here to remind you that you are a son and daughter of the Living God and we don't have to be bullied anymore now there was a guy who I really really loved and his name was sham guard and I know

of the goats and some of the labs and maybe the pigs are over here and there's chickens by your feet be careful they bite so just imagine this land it was his he didn't have much but what he had was his just like this family that we have might not be much to somebody but it's ours and you know what Shamgar worked so hard so he was there planting some seeds planting for the harvest with his beautiful family hey guys can you help me plant come on this plan everything that will ever be in this field starts off in this seed it's a wheat okay so you just take this back grab a handful and let's start planting and when they grow you're gonna be able to know the difference between a tear and a wheat see the tears an impostor he'll look like a weak but he's not a weak you can tell by the weak because the seeds they're pretty heavy so it makes the head fall down humbly before God the little tears gonna stick his head up like this all proud or don't worry when harvest comes we'll be
