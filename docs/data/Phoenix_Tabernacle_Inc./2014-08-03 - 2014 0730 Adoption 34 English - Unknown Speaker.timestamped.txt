[0:00] the Watchtower is the ordain that is
[0:02] what it's placed not by man but by my
[0:05] will I raise who I I please and I raise
[0:12] who I love I raise who pleases me I
[0:15] raise no
[0:18] one can can raise I order and I raise
[0:22] and that's how the Watchtower is that's
[0:24] how my word is that's how I say it or
[0:27] how the Lord says it I'm going to read
[0:30] to pray and read the word divine father
[0:32] this glorious
[0:33] morning here we are
[0:36] Lord
[0:38] with hearts in in our heads bow to the
[0:42] dust of the
[0:44] Earth for where our bodies made up from
[0:48] but deep within us you exist
[0:52] Lord and that is what entrust us for us
[0:57] to come before your throne of mercy and
[0:59] Grace
[1:00] and I beg you for that Redemptive Grace
[1:05] that you make yourself present through
[1:07] your word that be her
[1:12] our our
[1:16] help and Lord I give you thanks for this
[1:18] precious
[1:20] morning in this city father that's so
[1:24] amazing Phoenix
[1:27] Lord where this small remnant
[1:30] gathers itself so to be
[1:33] fed to not allow for something contrary
[1:37] to your word come out but the
[1:39] appropriate food into its Due Time Lord
[1:43] I beg you in the name of the Lord Jesus
[1:45] Christ open up your Bibles to Hebrews
[1:49] chapter
[1:52] 12 verse 5 to
[1:58] 11 then I'm going to make this try to
[2:02] make a brief and that we hope that God
[2:05] helps us in Hebrews 12:5 reades like
[2:10] this and you have forgotten the
[2:12] exhortation which speaks to you as it
[2:14] Sons my son do not despite the Chast
[2:18] chastening of the Lord nor be
[2:20] discouraged when you are rebuked by him
[2:22] for whom the Lord loves he
[2:24] chastises discourages every son whom he
[2:28] receives if you and endure chastising
[2:31] God deals with you as with sons for what
[2:35] son is there whom the father does not
[2:37] chasten but if you are without
[2:40] chastening of which all have become
[2:44] partakers then you are illegitimate and
[2:47] not
[2:50] Sons furthermore we had human fathers
[2:53] who corrected us and we PID them respect
[2:57] shall we not much more readily being
[3:00] subjection to the father of the spirits
[3:02] and
[3:03] live you may be seated Brothers this
[3:06] morning I'm going to be
[3:09] speaking on the same subject that we've
[3:12] been taking on Sunday mornings but more
[3:16] more than anything I'm going to be oh
[3:19] I'll be dedicating this message to the
[3:22] mothers especially to the mothers that
[3:28] now have 60 years or more amongst them
[3:33] that I'm for sure it's sister L and and
[3:36] my mother and I don't know who else
[3:38] might have that age but I reading this
[3:42] scripture which we've been
[3:45] meditating for many
[3:47] days I was
[3:49] considering that on May 10th in Mexico
[3:53] it celebrated Mother's Day and here in
[3:57] the United States it's on the 14 or
[4:00] today
[4:01] present and possibly some people are
[4:06] not well documented on the thing that
[4:09] our Prophet that he spoke to us
[4:12] regarding it some time ago I uh
[4:15] translated a message from English to
[4:18] Spanish preached by our Prophet our
[4:19] brother a precious brother William
[4:22] brandham and he entitled it Mother's Day
[4:27] and I have it recorded there for the
[4:29] benefit to that one that doesn't know
[4:31] English but there's
[4:35] something that
[4:37] being in in a trip with a brother
[4:40] Domingos from Brazil that he accompanies
[4:42] me I was there in the evening in my room
[4:46] studying on the subject of adoption and
[4:50] something there that Drew my attention
[4:54] and it's which I want to refer to for
[4:58] the following 45 5 minutes or remain and
[5:01] that is that a mother in order for her
[5:04] to be a
[5:06] mother needs to have
[5:09] children when we study the
[5:12] interpretation of the
[5:14] scripture which speaks the the Apostle
[5:18] St Paul speaks to us speaking to Timothy
[5:22] speaking of how the woman shall be saved
[5:25] um giving birth to to to children and it
[5:30] comes as a teaching in a vulgar uh
[5:33] worldwide that a woman shall be saved in
[5:37] giving birth to to
[5:39] children but the the prophet gives us
[5:41] the interpretation and says Paul there
[5:43] is speaking to the woman that is already
[5:45] in the faith for he says she shall be
[5:49] saved if she remains in the faith and
[5:53] then if we go to the scripture we see
[5:57] there that when a woman is she single
[6:01] she has the time in order to dedicate
[6:05] her own life or her body to the Lord and
[6:08] possibly she the time goes on and then
[6:12] she falls in love of a young man and she
[6:16] marries him then they begin or or so
[6:21] many problems begin to Surge because the
[6:23] Bible
[6:26] cannot counter say itself because the
[6:29] Bible says that the young man
[6:31] is takes care of the things that are
[6:34] pertaining to the lore but the woman
[6:37] takes care of how she is to please her
[6:39] husband that's why Paul repeats there
[6:44] she will be saved if she remains in the
[6:47] faith because the women's labor comes
[6:51] twice because she not only has to take
[6:53] care of herself but she has to make the
[6:56] preparations for her husband when she
[6:59] arise from work when he arise from work
[7:02] sorry then God gives him one or two
[7:05] children and then as much more children
[7:08] come then the labor multiplies itself
[7:11] and it's much easier for a woman to
[7:13] complain just like job spoke to her wife
[7:18] after job going through a suffering that
[7:20] was very harsh and saying that the
[7:22] critics surrounded Jo and that every man
[7:25] began to speak as as they were fools and
[7:29] this inspired as well W the woman then
[7:32] job said woman you've spoken as any
[7:34] other W ignorant
[7:37] woman because when the pressure
[7:40] increases everything comes to home and
[7:43] then when the man goes to work and he
[7:45] comes very fatigued and says the prophet
[7:47] of the age there that's where that women
[7:51] waits for him at the door and receives
[7:53] him with with a hug and receives him
[7:55] with a kiss and she receives him very
[7:59] very well dressed and combed and if that
[8:02] man came and arrive from work tired she
[8:06] takes that fatigu this away and the
[8:08] woman has a great
[8:11] part and when he
[8:13] receives that problem at work then the
[8:16] man brings that problem at home but that
[8:19] woman's there daily with her kind tender
[8:22] hands that caresses that child that God
[8:25] gave to them and she takes care of of
[8:28] the baby and she loses sleep for him and
[8:32] even though she gives and feeds that
[8:34] baby that God gave through her
[8:38] body even that takes that that child and
[8:41] even though that the husband comes and
[8:44] it's tired when she but when she remains
[8:47] in the Fate she recognizes that the head
[8:49] has just arrived to the home and when
[8:52] the body recognizes where the head
[8:56] is they always give all the honor and
[8:59] the glory to that
[9:02] head and that's one of the
[9:05] reasons why people stumble because they
[9:09] don't give honor to where the honor
[9:11] belongs to and God says I honor those
[9:14] that honor
[9:15] me and they see find me those that seek
[9:20] me in morning that's the reason why in
[9:24] parenthesis the prophet said that people
[9:27] in this time that will be lazy don't
[9:30] take care we're in a time where people
[9:33] fall
[9:34] asleep and the prophet said I I'm a
[9:36] early
[9:38] riser oh when your baby cries they don't
[9:42] hold back she doesn't think on anything
[9:45] else she's ready to go and help her
[9:50] child and we know that and we know as
[9:54] children of the lord we should be
[9:55] thankful with our heavenly father and as
[9:59] while he's watching and taking care of
[10:01] us we see then that a mother in order to
[10:06] be a mother she needs to have or bear
[10:09] bear children and truly in itself it
[10:11] doesn't mean according to what the
[10:14] scripture tells us that a mother is a
[10:16] woman that that bears a
[10:19] child because in bearing a
[10:22] child it only brought a being to
[10:27] existence it's transformed
[10:30] or has become a procreator uniting
[10:32] itself to the word of God and then gives
[10:36] gives birth to that trial that came
[10:38] through the holy matron but that's not
[10:41] all it's only the beginning so then the
[10:46] the raising begins that's the reason why
[10:49] many men in the world
[10:52] presently they don't give honor to their
[10:55] MO natural mother but they honor that
[10:58] woman that created them if you notice
[11:02] Moses he was created by the daughter of
[11:05] pharaoh and the Bible says that he
[11:07] refused to be called a son of the
[11:10] daughter of pharaoh he could have been
[11:13] called because he was the woman that
[11:15] that raised them but
[11:18] then all the good needs are inherited by
[11:22] the good care and the prophet gives us a
[11:24] very small thing there he says when a a
[11:27] sheep begins there to wand off says that
[11:31] the pastor possibly might break that
[11:34] little
[11:35] leg that small leg of that small lamb
[11:39] but that way he
[11:42] can care for for for that little lamb
[11:45] and take him in his arms and place him
[11:48] in his shoulders in order to have en
[11:51] closer in order to speak and and make
[11:55] czes to it because that's what makes
[11:58] fall in love and that's what the word of
[12:00] God speaks to us because there's times
[12:02] that there's no not not that family
[12:06] contact and the family begins to wander
[12:09] aside because the father and the mother
[12:11] are not sufficiently wise to unite their
[12:14] family to have a personal
[12:17] contact talk with them instruct the
[12:20] child give them to eat give them
[12:25] um and let me tell you that it's what
[12:27] unites a family a a mother's not just a
[12:30] mother because she gives birth a father
[12:33] is not just a father because he he he
[12:35] bears but their fathers when they raise
[12:39] when they H blessed be the name of the
[12:41] Lord no wonder the prophet said that he
[12:44] doesn't allow for a man to be a deacon
[12:46] except he has been married because as a
[12:50] young man he does not know these things
[12:52] there's many young men that do not
[12:54] appreciate what they have because they
[12:56] are young but one day they will be
[12:58] father others and
[13:01] then they will be sadden or they shall
[13:04] regret the time that they rejected from
[13:07] their parents because now they are are
[13:09] are
[13:12] parents but the word of God teaches the
[13:15] instruction we we shouldn't have that
[13:17] mistake because we have the word of God
[13:19] and it should be
[13:21] wise and seeing that it's Mother's Day
[13:24] and we dedicate it to
[13:25] them I instead of speaking of of the
[13:29] mother I want to speak of the
[13:31] children and this is what I I was
[13:36] meditating uh being absent from
[13:40] home and I just wrote down some small
[13:43] scriptures taken as a Bays as adopted
[13:48] children so then the only way that we
[13:50] can be adopted the prophet says is for
[13:52] us to be faithful to God and the time
[13:55] come that he brings
[13:57] us
[14:00] so then he does a public
[14:02] ceremony and says this is my my my my
[14:05] child he pleases
[14:07] me and here is Paul was speaking to the
[14:11] Hebrews and he's speaking there to the
[14:14] children and and he
[14:17] says do not
[14:20] reject it's because we want to reach the
[14:22] Perfection and we want to get to be part
[14:24] of the
[14:26] Bride we want to be there
[14:29] in in the resurrection but we win
[14:31] everything except we don't want to uh
[14:35] suffer the chastisement the Bible
[14:39] says said do not
[14:42] dismay in other words do not lose the
[14:45] enthusiasm do not lose your
[14:48] strength because when the rebuke has
[14:52] come then he just wants to
[14:56] dismay but he says do not be discouraged
[15:00] when you are rebuked by him for whom the
[15:02] Lord loves he chastens and
[15:05] discourages now when I say it's three
[15:08] distinct words one from the other and
[15:11] that's where at times we as parents miss
[15:15] it the Bible
[15:17] says scourage chastan and
[15:22] Scourge in the third thing and we know
[15:26] what Scourge means when our children
[15:31] misbehave the only thing that we know is
[15:35] is to
[15:37] scorge and right away when they
[15:39] misbehave we take out the belt and we're
[15:41] good to to throw
[15:43] blows but before a a child Scorch he
[15:47] needs to be instructed and there's times
[15:50] that
[15:53] times kids now when they begin to grow
[15:57] you go and visit your relativ reles or
[15:59] your
[15:59] brothers and then you you're ashamed
[16:02] because that son that you you have he
[16:05] throws
[16:06] everything but that child's not ever
[16:09] going to know how to respect what's not
[16:12] his except he receives the
[16:16] instruction and when and when the child
[16:19] receives the
[16:23] instruction then what
[16:25] follows it's to is the rebuke
[16:29] but at times right away we jump to to to
[16:32] what it is to Scourge and we don't know
[16:34] other
[16:35] thing and
[16:37] and and as fiercly wild bees we we
[16:41] attack them but you need to be
[16:42] instructed into a
[16:44] church there's at times people do things
[16:47] that they shouldn't do the Bible says
[16:49] it's because lack of Doctrine lack of
[16:53] teaching that's why the prophet or the
[16:57] Apostle says
[16:59] that the olders should teach the
[17:02] youngest when they
[17:06] gather you know that our
[17:08] fellowship that that our
[17:12] fellowship should be completely around
[17:14] the word but at times they
[17:17] gather as the Elders of the almanacs the
[17:21] prophet says and those say you can't
[17:23] find them in the Bible possibly you
[17:25] might find them in Almanac of the
[17:28] mothers giving to understand that they
[17:32] gather not to have Fellowship on the
[17:35] things that the prophet teaches us but
[17:39] an elder woman should help out the
[17:42] youngest and the elder man or the mature
[17:46] man should instruct the young man
[17:50] blessed be the name of God allow me to
[17:53] tell you a small
[17:55] thing that the people should be
[17:59] impotent and a people should be Mighty
[18:02] it's the people which presently today is
[18:06] serving God under the message of the
[18:11] prophet and it's not impotent for the by
[18:14] emotion it's not impotent because his
[18:16] mind tells him to but through the
[18:20] instruction the bible say that there's
[18:22] no science the the people perishes and
[18:27] science comes through the doctrine and
[18:30] the instruction of the word amen blessed
[18:32] be the name of the Lord are you
[18:34] following me right it's a mother's
[18:37] day but then we
[18:39] see first of all the
[18:42] the rebuken this comes and the prophet
[18:45] doesn't miss it and I don't take the
[18:48] honor because the honor belongs to God
[18:50] and to the one that God used the prophet
[18:52] said when a man
[18:54] misses and the Bible says if you see
[18:56] your brother uh fell
[19:00] and he goes and help he save he saved
[19:03] the soul from sin and cover multitude of
[19:05] sins so the Bible says you should go and
[19:08] speak to that man if he doesn't listen
[19:10] then refuse to any other man before two
[19:13] or
[19:15] three so then the first opportunity T we
[19:18] have we we want to right
[19:21] away Scourge him and we should give the
[19:24] man 30 days for him to make it right if
[19:26] not give give him to the devil but see
[19:28] what we do in our homes we want to make
[19:30] in our church and the prophet
[19:34] says how to you you raise a child and he
[19:37] says the training of the child is at
[19:40] home but being that we are home we want
[19:43] to be just like the tumble weed you know
[19:45] how the tumble weed was the tumble weed
[19:48] was was that like like those those weeds
[19:51] that are here in Arizona when those
[19:54] those trees and and the field they
[19:56] wanted a king and they went to the Fig
[19:58] Tree and they told the Fig Tree you'll
[20:01] be our King he said no because I'm a fig
[20:04] and when people eat the Fig they they
[20:07] praise me and they praise God and
[20:10] then they went
[20:12] to and then they he said no I mean
[20:16] because when they drink wine they praise
[20:18] me and and they praise
[20:20] God and then they went to the tumble
[20:23] weed that weed or or that tumble weed
[20:27] that does not give no shade and they say
[20:30] we we want you to be our King and he
[20:32] said very well but I demand one thing
[20:36] that every tree
[20:38] come and make shade on my
[20:41] shade but Fire come from the tumble we
[20:45] and consumes them and that's how at
[20:47] times we
[20:48] are see brother forgive me but the
[20:52] reason why there's so many children that
[20:56] are bad or that are are fools it's
[21:00] because they have not received the the
[21:02] teaching and I don't know Spanish but
[21:05] you're going to help me but here we have
[21:06] the husband of our sister esta right
[21:09] that now she's no longer esta but notice
[21:13] he can help us says oh what a misbehaved
[21:17] child and truly
[21:20] saying foolish of me how I Mis raised
[21:24] him my son he's so badly raised and and
[21:28] she's just hitting her head because they
[21:30] want to be responsible for raising them
[21:32] the fathers see but we need to receive
[21:34] the instruction from the word when we
[21:37] instruct the child and if he doesn't
[21:39] listen so then we rebuke him oh when you
[21:43] tell your son oh seems son that you're
[21:46] doing pretty good always says thank you
[21:48] Daddy thank you Dad but you just tell
[21:51] him hey what's going on what I told you
[21:53] to do why didn't you do it oh the joy
[21:56] just left and you bringing out to the
[21:58] spiritual it seems that at times there's
[22:01] oh that Bright's leaving I'm going to go
[22:03] to heaven and there's days that I don't
[22:05] even want to raise my head and and it
[22:09] seems that it's just a tornado of goats
[22:12] and they're just ready to hit their
[22:14] heads and that's how we are and we see
[22:17] the son there he's just on the corner
[22:19] just very upset he doesn't even want to
[22:20] speak and why are you doing son they ask
[22:24] how you doing are you mad and yes
[22:26] because I rebuked them but see first of
[22:30] which repen according to the scripture
[22:32] then the chastisement comes and when
[22:36] people hear about chastisement they
[22:37] think right
[22:39] away of the the discouragement but it's
[22:43] it's
[22:45] differently than the other but forgive
[22:47] me Brothers we've been we we've created
[22:50] a
[22:52] generation a very ungrateful generation
[22:54] the reason why we've become accustomed
[22:57] to to that and I don't refer to
[23:00] everyone but I refer worldwide Daddy I
[23:04] Need a Dollar uh a dollar son here
[23:08] five Daddy I need a bike here son even
[23:12] though you take six months paying off
[23:14] that bike Daddy I need this and Daddy I
[23:16] need that and Dad gives him everything
[23:20] and as soon as he doesn't give what he
[23:22] wants then he gets upset and then
[23:25] there's some they write and they say Mr
[23:28] or Mrs or so and so I already have 15
[23:32] years and my daddy still has not bought
[23:34] me a a a car he doesn't let me drive the
[23:37] car and there that old man goes to go
[23:40] buy him a
[23:41] car then right after he misbehaved so
[23:45] bad and then we say what happened but if
[23:47] we began to chastise a little you don't
[23:51] need to
[23:53] Scourge but if the son does not learn to
[23:56] obey of what's asked from his right and
[24:00] then the same way you bring it to the
[24:02] spiritual there's men that they don't
[24:03] even want to sweep the floor they don't
[24:06] even want to know now and they don't
[24:08] even want to do anything in the temple
[24:10] or for the work of God but they want to
[24:12] be the first to stand behind a Pulpit
[24:14] allow me to tell you that first of all
[24:18] you should re restrict the Privileges
[24:21] and and chastising so they can
[24:24] understand that we are a people we're a
[24:25] family in Christ Jesus our lord
[24:29] they try to try to do it with your son
[24:31] right and then you shouldn't have so
[24:34] badly raised kids and
[24:37] ungrateful kids and then the other day
[24:40] they're telling me well brother consider
[24:42] what you're saying but we the fathers
[24:44] are the ones that are
[24:46] responsible and he do he has not reached
[24:49] to my level and I don't think he will
[24:52] but look my brother first of all he
[24:53] needs to be rebuked and then chastised
[24:56] and there's many other ways to chastise
[24:58] a son I remember when I went to school
[25:01] and at times possibly I misbehaved a bit
[25:05] and the teacher there the professor
[25:07] would sit me in a corner there in a high
[25:10] chair and they will place me a hat there
[25:13] little hat and everyone will see me I
[25:16] remember that when my father at my
[25:18] father's church when a child was
[25:21] speaking there in the temple I was going
[25:23] out and in and out and
[25:24] in the deacons would get him and would
[25:27] bring them all the way to the Altar and
[25:29] will KNE them right there just for a bit
[25:31] and they all knew that that child
[25:34] misbehaved but the but the the the
[25:39] deacons didn't didn't just take him and
[25:41] Scorch him but they chastise him but the
[25:44] chastisement should begin a home of each
[25:47] family and a child should
[25:51] not learn discouragement but you should
[25:55] sit him there and there and you're not
[25:56] going to get up from there until I tell
[25:58] you to and if you do get
[26:00] up then the discouragement comes then
[26:04] you take out the bell and so he may know
[26:08] that you are want you are meaning to say
[26:11] what you're
[26:12] saying but many of the of the mothers
[26:16] say oh don't you move because I'm going
[26:18] to chastise you and then now in our
[26:21] people is oh well listen because I'm
[26:23] going to hate you because the children
[26:25] know when one wants to say one thing or
[26:29] not that's the reason why at times
[26:32] people when they see me since they get
[26:35] so frighten because allow me to tell you
[26:37] that I go with you wherever you want to
[26:40] you want to go up to the hill all the
[26:42] way on top and and laugh and do whatever
[26:44] you want to do Run and Jump I'll run and
[26:47] jump and I'll play with you but when
[26:49] it's about the word the sacr word when
[26:53] it's about the things of the Lord I have
[26:56] no father mother grandfather father or
[26:58] grandmother and that's the gold there's
[27:00] the Golden Rule which is the word of the
[27:03] Lord now there's mothers there needs to
[27:07] be children that's the reason
[27:10] why turn other way up it's it's a little
[27:14] more hotter here behind the pulp and
[27:16] that's that's why I wanted all the young
[27:18] people
[27:19] here I'm going to begin to read your
[27:23] sentence if your sentence has never been
[27:25] read to you I'm going to read it this
[27:28] morning that's what happened with
[27:31] man did you know the prophet speaks to
[27:34] us and say that there's three steps to
[27:37] to the new birth and which is
[27:39] justification right and so on and then
[27:43] even though God calls you even though
[27:44] you're in that clay and even though that
[27:48] my play is all the way up there and even
[27:50] there God extends his hand to that myy
[27:54] clay to take you out but then he demands
[27:57] from you sanctification and then the
[27:59] Holy Ghost which is the new birth right
[28:04] then really the third thing is the Holy
[28:08] Ghost and in order for you to be
[28:13] born the person needs to die and that's
[28:15] what happens with many of us then when
[28:17] they come to the message and they've
[28:19] never been given the sentence I'm gonna
[28:21] give you the sentence I'mma sentence you
[28:24] to death to the young man to the ladies
[28:28] and if there's a man there elder or
[28:31] that's not on the on the line they is
[28:34] well I apply to to you the sentence you
[28:36] want to hear it Brothers Deuteronomy
[28:42] 8:5 it's like
[28:48] the you should know in your heart that
[28:51] is a man chasten his son so the Lord
[28:53] your God chasten you that's the reason
[28:56] why many people don't want to follow the
[28:58] message and the first thing they tell me
[29:00] it's oh brother I don't believe that I'm
[29:02] from God because I go through this that
[29:05] the other you should praise God because
[29:08] God is chastising you how do you see
[29:11] that if the prophet
[29:13] says that if our child's there by the
[29:17] Freeway and there the cars are coming
[29:19] real quick and we tell our child oh
[29:23] child God bless you there where you're
[29:25] at no no no we don't love him very much
[29:27] right we have to shout to them and bring
[29:30] them back and instruct them and then
[29:32] rebuke him and tell them you don't do
[29:34] that because you're going to die and
[29:36] just like the man chastise his
[29:40] son so the Lord your God Chas you but
[29:44] you need to recognize this in your
[29:47] heart the only way that you accept the
[29:50] chastised man that you first of all
[29:52] recognize in your heart that God
[29:58] chasten man allow me to prove it real
[30:02] quick the young man goes that it's been
[30:04] instructed that's been
[30:07] instructed I remember here is my older
[30:09] brother and he's been the most obedient
[30:11] one than than most of us I told you that
[30:15] I was the most terrible one but at times
[30:17] a man would go by about 40 years 50
[30:20] years and I had a cigarette in my
[30:23] hand and I can even just Puff The Smoke
[30:26] in his face but I would see that that
[30:29] hey here comes the chief I was even
[30:31] capable of swallowing the that cigarette
[30:34] even though I might burn my tongue
[30:35] because I recognized that that was my
[30:37] chief and that's how we should recognize
[30:41] in our hearts because if not we're not
[30:44] going to receive the rep the rebuken of
[30:47] our heavenly father he exorts us he
[30:50] rebukes us he instructs us and we reject
[30:53] the instruction and we laugh
[30:58] of the government of the pastor of the
[30:59] deacons and of the brothers and of our
[31:01] mother and of our
[31:03] father and not knowing that we are
[31:06] rejecting the word of
[31:09] God we need to recognize in our hearts
[31:13] that he is our
[31:15] father Revelation 3:19 don't you love
[31:18] God
[31:19] brother if you love him you have to love
[31:23] me it's like
[31:26] this
[31:32] I rebuke and
[31:34] chasten and as many as I love Oh Daddy
[31:38] it's because on Saturday evenings all
[31:41] the young people we accustomed to get
[31:43] together daddy and brother Garcia called
[31:46] the young men to get together but the
[31:49] father says son the whole week you
[31:52] misbehave you woke up at 11:00 in the
[31:55] morning screaming to your mom M to fix
[31:58] you up some tortillas and you she didn't
[32:00] make them the way you like them and you
[32:02] got mad you didn't clean the the
[32:04] backyard and you didn't wash the car and
[32:06] you didn't work during the week you
[32:08] didn't bring nothing to the house and
[32:10] you're
[32:12] so oh and I'm going to chastise you and
[32:15] I'm going to keep you at home oh but the
[32:17] pastor and right away they want to cover
[32:19] themselves with religion the prophet
[32:20] said that the religion is a covering we
[32:23] don't want religion we want the word of
[32:26] God one tells me brother Garcia you said
[32:29] this no
[32:29] sir I've never superseded a family you
[32:34] tell me one family that I've superseded
[32:36] a man and a wife
[32:39] never when have I superseded a couple or
[32:45] a man or a woman in
[32:48] the I know never I've preached the word
[32:51] and at home the parents are are the ones
[32:56] that are in charge but you know what
[32:57] happens nowadays forgive me the the
[32:59] young young people you're going to have
[33:01] to forgive me but I'm going to have to
[33:02] give you the sentence what happens is
[33:05] that in the world and of the
[33:08] world comes to the church the man there
[33:11] of the world comes out of comes out of
[33:14] school with his long hair he gets home
[33:17] just lays to sleep and gets up and says
[33:19] mom can you give me some dinner and then
[33:22] goes the whole evening and have some fun
[33:25] and it's not like later on that was the
[33:27] party in the
[33:28] weekend now the part is on Monday
[33:32] Tuesday Wednesday Thursday Friday and
[33:35] Saturday and Sunday all everything's
[33:37] just a party in the world now you bring
[33:39] it to the church and you want a party
[33:42] and you want a party and whatever you
[33:43] want to call it Monday Tuesday Wednesday
[33:46] Thursday Friday Saturday and Sunday but
[33:49] when you come to church oh he's just
[33:51] falling asleep because he's so tired the
[33:54] prophet spoke again those these things
[33:58] can the young people say amen amen and
[34:01] the young ladies can say amen and you
[34:03] know the favorite word here in the
[34:04] United States they say my daddy and my
[34:06] mom are a bunch of Party
[34:09] Poopers
[34:12] interpreters it's because it's it's it's
[34:17] it's it's because my dad is so old it's
[34:20] because oh he's just so old and she's
[34:25] so
[34:28] we let go of brother berunda and he'll
[34:30] possibly He he'll he he'll beat four
[34:32] young four or five people hadot dance he
[34:36] might be old from the outside but he's
[34:37] Young from the inside and I told uh a
[34:40] beloved young man and I believe that
[34:42] he's example and I'm going to name him
[34:44] by by by name it's his brother Jimmy but
[34:47] I had to SC him
[34:50] Yer we arrived yesterday from from our
[34:53] trip right away to his room and he was
[34:55] right there laying on the floor just
[34:57] like he was dying I said no no brother
[35:00] Domingos we pray for him he got up in
[35:02] the name of the Lord Jesus Christ there
[35:04] it is but I rebuked them and I said the
[35:08] prophet in the Bible who teaches us that
[35:10] we should take care of our bodies get up
[35:13] at 4: in the morning work the whole day
[35:16] until 3:00 in the morning and in the
[35:18] afternoon and then come to the temple
[35:19] without not having dinner and work here
[35:21] till 9:30 in the morning and in the
[35:24] evening day after day just other day
[35:28] there was a a party and I wanted brother
[35:30] muo to be here his brother muo here
[35:33] there was a party that
[35:36] party took me a step further to the gr
[35:41] It
[35:43] produced some gray hairs on me that the
[35:46] the young people were having a party and
[35:48] when I got to this party I saw certain
[35:51] spirits and certain
[35:53] individuals and I told Brother Maro and
[35:55] brother Maro said no brother it's not
[35:57] what you think no I say I don't miss it
[36:00] and I'm sure as I'm standing here that I
[36:02] don't miss it without nobody toing me
[36:06] anything I came to the
[36:08] church and Jimmy was here all the way
[36:11] until 11: in the night no nobody helping
[36:15] him out but everybody complaining like a
[36:18] child or a a child that's badly raised
[36:24] and I need to give you sentence to the
[36:26] to the youth
[36:28] no
[36:29] want take lightly your youth but be
[36:32] example to the faithful ones and I say
[36:35] it shouldn't be like
[36:38] that that's the reason why
[36:41] mother that's why you suffer you have
[36:45] daughters 15 16 17 years old and they
[36:47] still don't even know how to make
[36:48] tortillas they don't know how to make
[36:50] food and prepare
[36:53] food cuz that way the the the father
[36:57] would
[36:58] not get in trouble they do
[37:02] everything before I was going to get
[37:04] married and in my in-law's home very
[37:07] very
[37:09] nicely he he had clothing all around all
[37:12] around the house it was her clothes she
[37:16] learned how to eat meat in my home she
[37:19] was a servant he was a servant of God
[37:21] they were poor but when I got there
[37:24] called her daddy and oh so you love this
[37:27] young man let me see make him some some
[37:30] dinner make the T tortillas make the
[37:32] tortillas ready see first of all you
[37:36] teach then you
[37:38] rebuke you don't tell them make me
[37:41] tortillas make it this way and you don't
[37:43] tell them make it this
[37:45] way you don't know but you teach them
[37:48] sister Gloria when she got married
[37:51] prepare a tremendous dish to brother
[37:53] arando place the the the beans
[37:57] and they look so beautiful and they look
[37:59] so tasty but when brother Armando since
[38:02] he loved her so much he didn't say
[38:04] anything but our sons and daughters
[38:07] should be instructed right Brothers the
[38:09] Bible says in here our rebuke and
[38:13] chastise now if a young lady and you
[38:16] teach her and you teach her and you
[38:18] teach her and you teach her and then she
[38:20] doesn't want to learn invite me over to
[38:23] her house and then that she before me
[38:26] make the food and even though it might
[38:30] it might not be well cooked I'll still
[38:32] eat it but she still be rebuked and
[38:34] she'll then know that it's better to
[38:36] learn what she's alone but if she never
[38:39] if you never do it she's that woman's
[38:40] never going to be good for nothing
[38:42] Brothers we we are responsible to raise
[38:45] our children according to the word of
[38:47] the Lord oh people say oh now the
[38:51] children are not how they used to be
[38:53] forgive me the parents are not how they
[38:55] used to be
[38:57] they go into the church and I'll sit
[38:59] there next to my mom's side and I'll
[39:01] move just a bit like if I had some
[39:05] ants and then I would just turn quarter
[39:07] and I would turn a bit and then she'll
[39:10] give me half
[39:12] place and then if I I didn't listen
[39:15] she'll pinch me all the way 360° then I
[39:17] wouldn't move without crying without
[39:20] moving without getting excited and
[39:22] nobody would even find out only I
[39:25] because I was the one receiving the
[39:27] pinch but noway know we should learn
[39:31] that we need to rebuke and
[39:33] chastise and if the the son misbehaves
[39:36] when we get home hey I'm going to play
[39:38] some ball no sir you sit there and sit
[39:43] him down and you sit him there and then
[39:46] that poor child stays there later on he
[39:48] begins to just nod and then later on he
[39:50] falls asleep and
[39:52] thinks oh how bad my dad is but when he
[39:55] grows up
[39:56] he says blessed be my father and my
[39:59] mother but when know they
[40:03] themselves talk back to their dad and
[40:06] you left me you left me why didn't you
[40:09] corrected me I don't want no one to say
[40:13] that of me spiritual look Brothers tell
[40:17] me the the young the young people you
[40:19] answer amen yes or no the
[40:23] normal there is if there's a son needs
[40:26] to be a father right there had needs to
[40:29] be a mother there is that right
[40:32] amen you have a brother a mother brother
[40:35] Morales or Andrade you have a mother and
[40:39] a father you Brother

[40:43] but you had a mother and know a father
[40:45] right and your sister you there's no way
[40:48] right so then the normal is that there
[40:51] needs to be a father and a mother
[40:55] right then then what are we doing what
[40:58] do we do with the young people and the
[41:00] young ladies that the ones that are in

[41:29] themselves should be governing
[41:30] themselves there needs to be an order in
[41:34] the home and of the Lord because if not
[41:37] later on we're just going to have a
[41:39] bunch of young people here and a young
[41:41] of ladies over there just running and
[41:42] all night bringing up a wrong testimony

[44:34] Brothers Brothers forgive me but I have
[44:37] to say
[44:38] it I remember when I was young I was
[44:41] about 13 years old and I would do the
[44:45] the labor of a man and you can even ask
[44:47] my brother there he's
[44:49] there he can tell you that I was able to
[44:51] do the labor of a man but many of these
[44:54] people young men they're 20 30 years old
[44:57] and they still don't know how to do
[44:58] anything and we should even instruct
[45:00] them how to even work or even Jesus his
[45:04] father that claimed to be his father but
[45:05] he wasn't his father because God was his
[45:07] his father he took him up and said look
[45:09] this is how you take up the the hammer
[45:11] and this is how you take out the saw and
[45:12] this how you take the nail and then he
[45:14] hit the nail with the hammer and then
[45:16] Jesus would hit a bit crooked and and he
[45:20] he didn't
[45:21] scream he said no son like this like
[45:24] this but we never instruct our children
[45:26] never know how to do anything we never
[45:27] instruct their daughter they should know
[45:30] on what to work they get married and
[45:33] they have no profession oh I wish I was
[45:36] a
[45:37] carpenter I wish I was a plumber I wish
[45:41] I was a teacher there at high school you

[50:49] asked permission to to her father and
[50:51] that she wanted to go there to the dance
[50:52] and they didn't let her go and she took
[50:54] off and somewhere around there she began
[50:57] to dance with a very good-looking man
[51:00] and then she went out of of of of the
[51:03] ballroom and
[51:05] then he took her there to a
[51:11] trip and then she was dying they had
[51:14] burned her she
[51:17] died with whom did she

[51:36] have a father or any young lady that
[51:39] doesn't have a mother that you might not
[51:41] have that you possibly might be
[51:43] fatherless or you have your your father
[51:46] thousands or hundreds of miles away from
[51:48] here you shouldn't do anything first of
[51:50] all until you first of all you tell me
[51:55] and you don't go and tell anybody else
[51:57] and cover yourself with religion I don't
[51:59] want those young people that around 1 or
[52:02] 2: in the morning they're running around
[52:05] that's not what the word of God the
[52:08] message teaches us that's contrary to
[52:10] the word of God I'm going to bring a
[52:11] scripture once more Proverbs
[52:23] 10:1 and why son makes a glad father
[52:43] foolish a wise son makes a father glad
[52:46] but a foolish man despises his
[52:49] mother Proverbs
[52:54] one
[52:59] my son hear the instruction of your
[53:01] father and do not forsake the law of
[53:02] your mother for there will be a graceful
[53:04] ornament on your head and chains about
[53:07] your neck and these people say oh how
[53:10] good son and how a young good lady
[53:13] that's so pleasing a crown
[53:17] right they should be into your head
[53:20] people saying oh how beautiful how
[53:24] beautiful because they are
[53:26] obeying but her father and her mother
[53:28] have instructed them now here it is
[53:30] verse
[53:31] 10 my son if Sinners entice you to not
[53:36] consent the prophet said the only sin is
[53:41] unbelief the attributes of sin is to
[53:45] smoke but that's not a sin so then this
[53:48] sinner it's not the Sinners that are are
[53:51] drinking or smoking the Sinners that are
[53:54] in the church
[53:55] if
[53:57] they want to entice you you don't
[54:00] consent oh let's go let's go brother
[54:02] Garcia is still sleep he won't even know
[54:04] well where are we going or we're going
[54:06] to Yuma and then they call us brother
[54:08] Bernie and so and so well I don't know
[54:10] brother there's somewhere around Yuma
[54:12] don't don't don't be
[54:16] frighten I have this since before
[54:18] getting here yesterday don't leave yet
[54:21] don't you
[54:23] know that the parents of
[54:26] yours they knowing your
[54:30] Phoenix they're not aware they say
[54:32] brother Garcia is watching for them to
[54:34] be well and everyone wants to pull their
[54:37] own way because they work and they're
[54:39] their man now brother I'm going to give
[54:41] you the last scripture that way you
[54:43] don't think that I'm
[54:44] Antichrist that is why it is
[54:47] written man shall
[54:50] live his father and his
[54:54] mother
[54:58] I don't care what you or somebody else
[55:00] told
[55:01] me that
[55:03] son is subjected to a
[55:08] a a
[55:10] government at home until he gets married
[55:13] and he has to be according to the
[55:15] scripture children obeying the
[55:18] Lord now if the father tells you
[55:21] something that's against the
[55:23] word but you need to give the respect to
[55:26] the father and the mother until the last
[55:28] day that you go out to get married and
[55:31] if you're not here with your father
[55:33] other than your mom you need to be in
[55:35] respect I am responsible for you you
[55:38] understand me those ladies up there I'm
[55:40] responsible and if you cut your hair and
[55:43] your dad doesn't tell you anything he's
[55:46] responsible but if you cut your hair and
[55:48] you don't have a dad here I'm going to
[55:50] call you and if you don't listen I'm
[55:53] going to present you before the church
[55:55] that way people can know that we're not
[55:58] in agreement for the women to cut her
[56:00] hair nor she to use pants or the the
[56:05] young men be just flirting with the
[56:07] ladies or be going around with the
[56:11] ladies you don't have no right for that
[56:13] by your head Divine father this A
[56:16] Mother's Day which people celebrate Lord
[56:20] I have not more to give them to this
[56:23] mothers but to help them to place the
[56:27] discipline of the word you know that I
[56:30] love my mother with all my
[56:33] heart before coming here Lord there's
[56:36] two women that I had in my mind that was
[56:38] my mother and sister
[56:40] L elderly woman that truly
[56:46] Lord they should be placed in a special
[56:49] place according to your
[56:50] word that's the reason why when I see H
[56:54] Lord
[56:55] being a young man without getting
[56:57] married and that he seeks Out Sister
[57:00] Lord I say Blessed Be You Lord because I
[57:04] remember of of of Timothy Lord when Paul
[57:07] speak to him and say of that faith
[57:10] without pretending which was first of
[57:13] all was en Loa her grandmother and then
[57:16] Eunice her mother and I'm sure father
[57:18] that in you he can be found but
[57:21] Lord what bad thing can one of this
[57:25] young people receive like Joel being
[57:27] with sister K that shows to me much
[57:31] l tell me who you're with and I'll tell
[57:33] you what you're looking for oh Lord
[57:36] possibly I possibly hit so hard to this
[57:39] ladies and this young man but the
[57:41] prophet came to restore us to the
[57:42] original Faith
[57:44] father and we can't be raised up without
[57:47] first of all we be shaken of all the
[57:50] things and of the habits that are
[57:53] contrary to your word
[57:55] Lord Heal these young people and these
[57:58] ladies you know quite well father that I
[58:01] do it because they're
[58:03] obligated I'm obligated not as the grand
[58:08] mothers Lord that possibly I take out
[58:10] some
[58:11] candy just some treats like the people
[58:14] the young people call them just to
[58:15] entertain them and possibly I don't want
[58:18] to take out some candy to this people
[58:20] want to take some candy and take them
[58:23] away from me father but at the end of
[58:25] the race they will know that I did it
[58:28] for love for them Lord not because I I
[58:33] was born with that love but that love is
[58:36] from your word it's you yourself Lord
[58:39] speaking through your vessel help them
[58:42] out Lord take them to
[58:45] Perfection bless them Lord in the name
[58:48] of the Lord Jesus
