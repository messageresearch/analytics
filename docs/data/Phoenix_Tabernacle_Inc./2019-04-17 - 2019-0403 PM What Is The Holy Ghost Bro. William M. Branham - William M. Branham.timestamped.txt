[0:10] are they part of meeting this meeting is
[0:16] to be a little different meeting than
[0:18] what we usually had here mostly every
[0:22] time when we come together here it's
[0:25] meeting to for the healing of the sick
[0:29] and for the physical needs
[0:34] it's the emphasis is put upon that but
[0:39] tonight we have started this revival for
[0:42] the healing of the soul the spirit of
[0:48] the man however the Lord willing Sunday
[0:53] morning at Sunday school Sunday morning
[0:56] we are going to have prayer for the sick
[0:59] in a regular line of healing or Sunday
[1:03] morning the Lord willing
[1:04] and these weeknights we are greatly
[1:10] pressed to speak on the eternal things
[1:15] for the the soul we know that when a
[1:19] body is healed that makes us all happy
[1:23] because we know that it definitely shows
[1:28] that our God yields the state but that
[1:33] sick person if they lived long enough
[1:36] will perhaps be sick again maybe with
[1:39] the same disease that they were healed
[1:41] on and that doesn't take away healing
[1:45] the doctor will give medicine for
[1:47] pneumonia and maybe two days later they
[1:49] will die with the ammonia after he's
[1:51] pronounced them well it reoccurs again
[1:54] but when that soul is healed you have
[1:59] then in you eternal life and I believe
[2:02] that we are so close to the coming of
[2:05] the Lord Jesus that it behooves us to do
[2:11] all that we possibly can
[2:14] bring Eversole to the kingdom and to
[2:17] bring the kingdom to the people that we
[2:22] might be healed of our spirits I believe
[2:27] that the body of Jesus is the sickest
[2:30] body that I know of that is the body
[2:34] spiritual body of Christ on earth is
[2:37] very sick and now we are not planning on
[2:44] keeping you too long of a night because
[2:46] on the first night we don't have room to
[2:50] seat our beloved friends we're in the
[2:54] project of building a new church a big
[2:57] tabernacle right you're on these Lots or
[3:00] wherever the Lord will lead but as far
[3:03] as we know here and now we have give out
[3:07] the meeting Wednesday through Sunday
[3:10] well then it's Sunday is closing into
[3:13] Christmas holidays but it's whenever the
[3:17] Lord tells us to stop that'll be the
[3:19] time we don't know just what the results
[3:22] will be but believing that the folks
[3:28] here at the tabernacle and our sister
[3:31] churches which is one of them is is the
[3:35] Holderness tabernacle at Utica which
[3:37] brother Grimm Snelling is the pastor and
[3:39] in New Albany where brother juni Jackson
[3:43] is pastor and also out on the highway
[3:46] where brother rattle is pastor we are in
[3:50] their sister churches of this Tabernacle
[3:53] we are trying to bring the art people
[4:00] into a better fellowship with Christ
[4:03] that's our purpose so I have chosen to
[4:09] read and to teach on for the next few
[4:12] nights tonight I want to speak on the
[4:15] subject of what is the Holy Ghost and
[4:20] tomorrow night I want to preach on what
[4:28] given bar and on Friday night and to the
[4:33] recorders I don't want this recorded
[4:35] Friday night how do I get the holy ghost
[4:40] in and how do I know when I have it then
[4:45] we will just let then see what the Lord
[4:49] will lead us for Saturday and Sunday and
[4:53] Sunday morning a healing service and
[4:55] another evangelistic service for Sunday
[4:58] night and now we want everyone to know
[5:02] that and I know the recorders is running
[5:07] in the backroom and we wish to say this
[5:12] because in these meetings like this on
[5:17] the evangelistic type we have people
[5:20] from different denominations of churches
[5:23] which has been taught in their own fear
[5:26] our belief each one and that's alright I
[5:33] have never wanted to be guilty of sowing
[5:37] discord among brethren and out in the
[5:40] meetings I just preach on the great
[5:42] evangelical truth of the scripture on
[5:45] what brethren who sponsor my meeting
[5:48] believe in but in the Tabernacle here I
[5:54] want to speak on what we believe
[5:58] therefore if you if you do not
[6:03] understand it I would be very happy to
[6:06] have a little letter or note from you to
[6:10] ask me a question of why that we believe
[6:15] it thus and I would be glad to try to
[6:19] explain it the best that I can you know
[6:23] every church if you don't have a
[6:27] doctrine you're not a church you've got
[6:30] to have something that you stand for
[6:33] some principles that you're holding up
[6:37] and regardless
[6:40] of what person's affiliation our
[6:44] denomination might be if that person is
[6:48] born doll the Spirit of God that's my
[6:51] brother or my sister regardless of we
[6:55] might different in other things as far
[6:58] as East from the West but we are still
[7:01] brothers and I would not do nothing but
[7:05] try to help that brother foreclosure
[7:08] better walk to Christ and I believe any
[7:11] real true Christian would do the same
[7:13] for me now I've asked this Tabernacle
[7:19] now we're not entering into this just
[7:23] far up attractive meeting I want to
[7:28] enter into this and I want you and have
[7:30] asked you to burn every Bridge that's
[7:34] behind you and make every sin right that
[7:39] we're coming into this with all that's
[7:42] in our hearts and lives we must come
[7:46] here for the sole purpose of getting our
[7:50] souls ready for the coming of the Lord
[7:54] and for no other purpose and as I have
[8:00] spoken and said that maybe sometime I
[8:03] might teach or say something that might
[8:06] be a little contrary to watch someone
[8:08] else will way they believe this idea did
[8:13] not comfort controversy
[8:15] I can't we're here to make ready the
[8:20] coming of the Lord and I think that this
[8:25] little group I've got some visiting
[8:27] brethren with me here I know from
[8:29] different places and we're happy to have
[8:33] them and no doubt the walk out to the
[8:35] audience there there's others from out
[8:37] of town from out from around our little
[8:40] joining cities here we're happy to have
[8:43] you and so appreciate it if you if you
[8:46] love us well enough to come be here
[8:48] these things God may you take home with
[8:53] you my brother's sister
[8:54] the richest treasures God can pour in
[8:57] your heart is my prayer and to this
[9:01] little tabernacle scene I believe that
[9:04] it is one of the finest people that I
[9:08] believe its own earth goes to this
[9:10] tabernacle
[9:11] I never said all the finest people I
[9:14] said some of the finest people on earth
[9:17] go to this tabernacle but as day by day
[9:22] entering back from meeting to meeting I
[9:25] see a great need of this tabernacle a
[9:28] great need in it and that spar of
[9:32] peeling our consecration a deeper life a
[9:38] closer walk with God and I have promised
[9:42] them to do this to have this message is
[9:46] for them and we're glad to bring you in
[9:49] and fellowship with us around the Word
[9:53] of God as we teach and try to bring out
[9:58] how the first three nights we will not
[10:01] be taken a subject of preach on but a
[10:04] message to teach from the Word of God
[10:07] and now for I would not ask anyone to do
[10:14] anything that I would not do myself and
[10:19] this week has been a complete Calvary
[10:24] for me I've been so close to to the
[10:32] blacking out as I would place it till I
[10:37] was almost beside myself but I have
[10:41] completely surrendered every will and
[10:46] everything that I know of to the Lord
[10:50] the other night at around little after
[10:53] midnight wife and I after setting up and
[10:58] praying and talking to the Lord across
[11:02] the little footstool in the our front
[11:06] room with
[11:06] open Bibles we consecrated ourselves a
[11:11] new to God for complete service that we
[11:16] would surrender our own wills and
[11:19] everything in every negative thoughts
[11:22] and to serve the Lord Jesus not trusted
[11:27] that's been your attitude to that you've
[11:30] done the same thing then when we are
[11:34] coming tonight we're coming up all holy
[11:36] ground among a people who's been praying
[11:41] and fasting and making restitutions and
[11:45] getting ready to receive something from
[11:47] God and I know that he that will come
[11:53] hungry will not go away hungry but God
[11:57] will feed with the bread of life
[12:00] now before we read from his sacred book
[12:04] let us bow our head just a moment for
[12:07] prayer Lord there has already been
[12:14] prayer offered in this place tonight
[12:18] there has been the songs of Zion has
[12:22] been sung by your children their hearts
[12:27] has been lifted up and we have come here
[12:32] to consecrate ourselves to thee and to
[12:38] worship thee from the depths of our soul
[12:42] and we are calling this to your
[12:46] remembrance Lord that you said when you
[12:51] set up on them out and taught your
[12:54] disciples listen are they that do hunger
[13:00] and thirst for righteousness for they
[13:04] shall be filled you promised it large we
[13:11] are coming tonight with open hearts we
[13:17] are coming hungry and thirsty
[13:20] and we know you keep your promise as we
[13:28] endeavor to open up these sacred pages
[13:32] of the Bible to read from it the
[13:36] contents may the Holy Spirit just take
[13:41] it to every heart may that speed fall
[13:46] down into deep rich faith that will
[13:51] bring forth ever promise that the word
[13:54] has made hear us Lord and cleanse us in
[14:01] trials and if there be any unclean thing
[14:07] about us Lord any unconfessed seein any
[14:12] thing that's not right reveal it just
[14:15] now or we'll walk right straight and do
[14:17] it or we realize we're living in the
[14:23] chapters of the coming of the Lord Jesus
[14:26] and we have all holy God come into the
[14:33] shadows of that Justice tonight and we
[14:38] are pleading for a new dedication and
[14:43] consecration and feeling of the Holy
[14:46] Spirit in our lives
[14:49] eating the revival bars begin to dim let
[14:53] us throw longwood of the word that it
[14:56] might Kindle a new fire that our hearts
[15:00] to be full of zeal thank Tobias Lord to
[15:06] thy precious Word in our blood and I
[15:08] Grace we plead and all thanks and praise
[15:13] will be done take all prejudice from our
[15:18] hearts cleanse the soul our give us pure
[15:22] hearts and clean hands and clean minds
[15:26] that we might come into the sanctuary
[15:29] night after night rejoicing and feel
[15:33] with your
[15:33] spirit we ask this in Jesus name and for
[15:39] his sake a man
[15:49] I wish to read the word just now while I
[15:53] asked you to bring your Bibles your
[15:57] pencils your papers for scriptures you
[16:00] so desire so it would be very fine and I
[16:07] while you're getting to the seventh
[16:09] chapter of Acts to begin with by answer
[16:16] the question or to start in answering
[16:18] the question what is the Holy Spirit
[16:24] there is nothing that will defeat Satan
[16:28] there's never been nothing on the earth
[16:30] yet that would ever defeat Satan like
[16:34] the Word of God Jesus used it in his
[16:38] great battle that it is written and this
[16:45] morning what I've been listening a few
[16:47] days ago to a broadcast that aim to want
[16:51] to tell that creation just come from
[16:53] some ashes blowing together and some are
[16:57] Satan the few chemicals of the earth and
[17:00] the warm sunshine created the germ of
[17:02] life and brought out life our ridiculous
[17:07] when the sunshine will kill any germ of
[17:09] life lay a germ out in the sunshine
[17:13] it'll kill it immediately and there is
[17:19] no such thing but Satan trying to punch
[17:23] that at me now after I've taken my
[17:26] little Rebecca to school this morning
[17:28] and on the road back I started to turn
[17:32] the radio on again and I thought I'd get
[17:34] into that stuff again so I just turned
[17:36] it back off
[17:37] and as I going on up the street
[17:40] Satan said to me he said do you know
[17:44] that this man that you called Jesus was
[17:47] just a man like one day in his day like
[17:51] Billy Graham Oral Roberts he was just a
[17:55] man that they began to have a few people
[17:58] to gather around
[18:00] and say he's a great man in actuality
[18:02] comes greater and then he become a god
[18:06] to them and now it's scattered all over
[18:10] the world since he's dead and that's all
[18:13] I thought out a liar you are and then I
[18:20] turn just as I was crossing grim Street
[18:23] I said Satan you this talking to my
[18:26] conscience I'd like to ask you a few
[18:29] things who was it that the hebrew
[18:33] prophets spoke of that would come who
[18:37] was The Anointed Messiah what was up on
[18:40] those man who foresaw him and told his
[18:43] life thousands of years before he got
[18:45] here who wasn't it foretold adjust to
[18:50] the letter and when he come they said he
[18:53] was numbered with the transgressors and
[18:55] he was he was wounded for our
[18:58] transgressions and he was he made his
[19:01] grave with the rich but he would rise up
[19:05] the third day and he did and then he
[19:10] promised the Holy Ghost and I've got it
[19:13] so you just might as well get away from
[19:15] it they call it it's written in the word
[19:18] and every word is true then he left just
[19:25] give him the word that does it
[19:29] he can't stand that word or its inspired
[19:34] let's start reading tonight in the
[19:37] seventh chapter of the book of Acts then
[19:41] said the high priest are these things so
[19:44] and he said men and brethren and father
[19:49] parkin the god of glory appeared to our
[19:53] father Abraham when he was in massa Pony
[19:56] on before he dwelt in chyrons
[19:58] and said unto him get thee out of thy
[20:01] country and from thy kindred and common
[20:05] to a land which I'll show thee then
[20:09] cainy out of the land of the Chaldeans
[20:11] and dwell
[20:13] in Sharan and from since when his father
[20:19] was dead he removed him into this land
[20:22] wherein you now dwell and he gave him
[20:27] non inheritance in it no not so much as
[20:30] to set his foot on yet he promised that
[20:35] he would give it to him for a possession
[20:38] and to his seed after him when as yet he
[20:43] had no child God spake on this wise that
[20:49] his seed said sojourn in a strange land
[20:54] and that they should bring them into
[20:56] bondage and entreat them evil for four
[21:00] hundred years and the nation to whom
[21:03] they shall be in bondage will our judge
[21:06] saith God and add to that shall they
[21:10] come forth and serve me in this country
[21:13] and he gave him the Covenant of
[21:16] circumcision and so Abraham begat Isaac
[21:21] and circumcised in the eighth date and I
[21:24] think they got Jacob and Jacob begat the
[21:26] twelve patriarchs upon this place we
[21:31] wish to approach the subject which I
[21:36] think is the outstanding subject of
[21:39] today of the what is the holy spirit
[21:48] what is it
[21:50] and now the reason I have taken these
[21:53] subject in line like this you cannot
[21:57] come and receive the holy spirit unless
[22:02] you know what it is and you cannot
[22:06] receive it if you know what it is unless
[22:09] you believe it's given to you and it's
[22:14] for you and then you cannot know whether
[22:20] you've got it or not unless you know
[22:22] what results it brings so if you
[22:27] know what it is and who it's to and what
[22:34] action it brings when it comes then
[22:37] you'll know what you've got when you get
[22:39] it that just would settle it Josh like I
[22:46] was talking to our brother Jeffrey's
[22:49] today and he said I would like to be at
[22:53] the meeting tonight but I'll be there
[22:55] tomorrow night he didn't know the
[22:56] meeting was going on because we didn't
[22:58] announce it just right here some of the
[23:01] brother Leo and then wrote to some of
[23:03] our friends and told him out of town
[23:06] well because we didn't have room now I
[23:12] said brother Jeffrey's if you sent me
[23:17] down to turn on one of your aura wells
[23:20] and I didn't know nothing about it I'd
[23:23] probably blow it up or I might turn the
[23:27] wrong key or thought the wrong motor I'd
[23:32] have to know how to do it before I did
[23:35] it that's the way with receiving the
[23:38] Holy Ghost you've got to know what you
[23:42] are coming for and how to receive it and
[23:45] what it is now the first place the Holy
[23:52] Spirit has been promised we could take
[23:55] in weeks and never just skip the age of
[24:00] this subject what the Holy Spirit is but
[24:03] the first thing I want to approach it
[24:05] just enough to give an outline each
[24:08] night then see the following night if
[24:11] there's any question how many in here
[24:14] has not received the Holy Ghost been
[24:16] baptized of the Holy Ghost raise your
[24:18] hand
[24:18] you know the admin just looked at him
[24:23] now I want to talk on it as a Holy
[24:30] Spirit being a sign or it is a sign we
[24:36] realize that that all
[24:40] is given to us by Abraham was a father
[24:46] of the promise because God gave the
[24:51] promise to Abraham and to his seed after
[24:55] him the promises made to Abraham and to
[25:00] his seed and this sign is to a covenant
[25:07] people now there is a vast difference
[25:12] between just a Christian and a Holy
[25:17] Ghost filled Christian and now we're
[25:23] going to get this from the scripture and
[25:25] place it just exactly in the scripture
[25:28] the first place there is a Christian
[25:31] professed to be a Christian but if this
[25:37] Christian has not yet been filled with
[25:41] the Holy Ghost he's only in process of
[25:45] being a Christian see he is professed to
[25:49] believe it he's working to it but God
[25:54] has not yet given him this spirit of the
[25:57] Holy Ghost he's not yet reached that
[26:00] goal with God that God's recognized it
[26:03] because that God made a covenant with
[26:08] Abraham after he had called Abraham
[26:10] which is a type of calling sixth
[26:14] believer today he called Abraham and
[26:18] Abraham moved out of his country and
[26:23] went into a strange land to dwell among
[26:28] strange people and that was a type of
[26:33] when God calls the man the stop is
[26:37] meanest repent of extense he turns then
[26:40] from the crowd that he was in to live in
[26:44] a new crowd among new types of people
[26:50] and then after God found
[26:53] Abraham to be safe or to the power that
[26:58] God gave him that he would have the
[26:59] child in through this child all the
[27:02] earth would be blessed
[27:04] then God confirmed his faith by giving
[27:09] him a sign and that sign was
[27:12] circumcision and circumcision is a type
[27:17] of the Holy Spirit just the very next
[27:22] verses of this chapter that we have just
[27:25] read if you want to take it down and the
[27:31] even said in the fifty first verse
[27:34] yeast if Nick's uncircumcised in the
[27:39] heart and ears you do always resist the
[27:42] Holy Ghost as your father's did so to
[27:45] you circumcision is a type of the Holy
[27:52] Ghost and God gave Abraham the the
[27:58] circumcision signed after he had
[28:01] accepted God on his promise and walked
[28:04] out into a strange country it was a time
[28:09] and all his children and his seat after
[28:15] him should have this sign in their flesh
[28:18] because it was a distinction it was to
[28:23] separate them from all other people this
[28:30] sign of circumcision and that's what God
[28:35] uses the day it's the sign of
[28:39] circumcision of the heart the holy
[28:43] spirit that makes God's church a
[28:48] separated church from all other creep
[28:51] phase and denominations there in all
[28:57] kinds of denomination but yet they are a
[29:00] separated people you let me talk to a
[29:04] man two minutes I can tell you whether
[29:06] you
[29:07] the Holy Ghost or not so can you it's
[29:12] separate sent it's a mark it's a sign
[29:16] and the Holy Spirit is a sign and its
[29:22] any child that refused circumcision in
[29:28] the Old Testament which was a foreshadow
[29:32] of the Holy Ghost was cut off from
[29:36] amongst the people he could not have
[29:40] fellowship with the rest of the
[29:43] congregation if he refused to be
[29:45] circumcised now pattern that to today a
[29:51] person that would refuse to receive the
[29:55] baptism of the Holy Ghost can have no
[29:58] fellowship among those that has the Holy
[30:00] Ghost you just can't do it you have to
[30:05] be a nature like it's my mother there
[30:09] used to say birds of a feather flock
[30:11] together well it's an old proverb but
[30:15] it's a true one you don't see doves and
[30:18] crows fellowship in their diets are
[30:21] different their habits are different
[30:23] their desires are different that's why
[30:27] it is with the world and with the
[30:28] Christian when you have been circumcised
[30:32] by the Holy Spirit which means to cut
[30:37] off a flesh circumcision could only be
[30:43] in the mail but if the woman was married
[30:47] to a man she was part of him
[30:50] she was circumcised with him you
[30:55] remember in Timothy words said that
[30:56] notwithstanding she shall be saved in
[30:59] childbearing if she continues in faith
[31:01] and holiness with all sobriety
[31:03] now circumcision
[31:06] you know when Sarah laughed in the tent
[31:10] behind her at the message of the angel
[31:14] when he said Abraham not knowing who he
[31:17] was a stranger
[31:19] where is thy wife Sarah how did he know
[31:25] that he had a wife as Jesus said as it
[31:29] was in the days of love so will it be in
[31:32] the coming of the Son of Man
[31:34] remember those signs wasn't committed
[31:36] down to Sodom and Gomorrah in the world
[31:39] amongst the religionists but it was to
[31:42] the elect that called out and Abraham
[31:46] was called out and the word church means
[31:50] called out the separated like Abraham
[31:56] operating and then when Sarah laughed at
[32:03] the very message of the angel God would
[32:06] have killed her on the spot but he could
[32:10] not bother Sarah without bothering
[32:13] Abraham because they were one she was
[32:20] part of a you're no longer clean but one
[32:25] toe circumcision the Holy Spirit today
[32:31] circumcised is the heart and it's a sign
[32:34] a given side someone said the other day
[32:41] I just repeat this not as a joke because
[32:45] it's the truth but it sounds like a joke
[32:48] as I've often said this is no place for
[32:51] jokes but there was a little German out
[32:56] on the west coast where we were just ad
[32:59] he received the Holy Ghost and he went
[33:04] down the street and he would walk a
[33:07] little piece and he's raised up his
[33:09] hands and speaking tongues and he would
[33:11] run and he would jump and even shout and
[33:14] he was at work hang all I got and his
[33:17] boss said to him where have you been
[33:21] uh-huh I like those places where you
[33:25] have been he said you must have been
[33:31] down amongst that bunch of
[33:33] nuts he said then you think they are
[33:39] nuts
[33:40] he said sure they are he said well
[33:44] praise the Lord for the nuts
[33:48] and he said do you know what the nuts
[33:53] play a big part he said for instance the
[33:57] automobile you take all the nuts out of
[34:01] it you ain't got nothing but a bunch of
[34:03] young so that's just about right you are
[34:10] so different and the Holy Spirit comes
[34:15] on you until the mind of this world
[34:19] don't like you in there oh and they
[34:23] don't want nothing to do with you at all
[34:25] you're a born of another world you are
[34:30] just as much a alien in times more alien
[34:34] you'd be if you'd go in too far from
[34:36] regions of African jungles you're
[34:40] different when the Holy Spirit comes and
[34:43] it's a sign it's unmarked amongst the
[34:47] people
[34:48] now you say then brother venom that sign
[34:53] of circumcision was given to Abraham
[34:56] that is true I'm to his seed yes all
[35:02] right now we are going to turn to
[35:05] Galatians third chapter xxix first and
[35:08] see how that could apply to us Galatians
[35:12] three and twenty nine and just see how
[35:17] this circumcision could have applied to
[35:21] a Gentile if we are Gentiles which by
[35:28] natural birth we are now the first I
[35:33] want to read the sixteenth verse now to
[35:36] Abraham and his seed were the promises
[35:39] made Abraham and his seed he said not
[35:45] and to seeds I just any kind of a cell
[35:49] I'm Abraham seeds - no - a seed
[35:53] Abraham's seed not the seeds as of many
[35:56] but as of one and to do they
[36:01] and to thy seed which is Christ Christ
[36:07] was Abraham's seed you believe that all
[36:11] right now let's get to 28 and 29 first
[36:15] there is neither Jew nor Greek neither
[36:20] is our bond our freeze neither is our
[36:23] male or female for we are all one in
[36:27] Christ Jesus
[36:30] and if ye be Christ's then ye are
[36:35] Abraham's seed and heirs according to
[36:38] the promise how do we take on Abraham's
[36:46] seed by being in Christ then we are
[36:51] Abraham's seed and what was the seed of
[36:56] Abraham as we might go on to Roman's
[36:57] forward different places Abraham never
[37:03] received the promise while he was
[37:07] circumcised to show that circumcision
[37:10] was just a type
[37:12] he received the promise before he was
[37:16] circumcised and it was a type of
[37:21] recognition of his state that he had
[37:25] before he was circumcised now when we
[37:29] are in Christ we become Abraham's seed
[37:34] and her heirs with Christ therefore no
[37:39] matter who we are Jew or Gentile and the
[37:43] seed of Abraham the seed of Abraham has
[37:48] the faith of Abraham who takes God at
[37:53] His Word regardless of how ridiculous it
[37:57] seems how unusual you act how peculiar
[38:02] it makes you you take God at His Word
[38:06] regardless of anything Abraham at 75
[38:11] years old and Sara at 65
[38:15] Oh God Eddie's wording called anything
[38:18] contrary to it as though it was easy why
[38:22] do you think the doctors thought of that
[38:23] day what do you think the people thought
[38:26] when they seen an old man 75 years old
[38:29] going around praising God he's going to
[38:31] have a baby by his wife and her 65 years
[38:34] old about 25 years past menopause but
[38:39] you see it makes you act funny the faith
[38:43] of Abraham and when you're circumcised
[38:46] that the Holy Ghost it does the same
[38:48] thing to you it makes you do things that
[38:51] you didn't think you would do it makes
[38:53] you take God's promise and believe God
[38:56] now it's also besides or see a promise
[39:03] and a sign it's also a seal now if you
[39:11] will go with me unto Romans but first I
[39:15] want you to go with me to Ephesians 4:30
[39:20] and let's read here just a minute
[39:27] Ephesians 4:30 says this now you've
[39:31] heard so many people say that different
[39:34] things are seals if you go into the
[39:37] church you have the seal of the church
[39:39] and some people says it's keeping a
[39:43] certain day a Sabbath day that's that's
[39:46] a seal of God some of them says if we
[39:49] put our membership into a certain
[39:51] denomination we are sealed into the
[39:53] kingdom of God now the Bible said let
[39:57] every man's word be a lie and gods be
[40:01] the truth now Ephesians 4:30 leads like
[40:05] this and grieve not the Holy Spirit of
[40:08] God whereby ye are sealed unto the day
[40:13] of redemption I'm going to have to get a
[40:19] little bit hard on this now lay down are
[40:22] you legal espresso just hold quite a
[40:24] little bit did you notice how long that
[40:27] CLA
[40:30] not to the next revival until the next
[40:34] time something goes wrong I'll kill the
[40:39] day of your Redemption until the day of
[40:46] your redemption when you are redeemed up
[40:50] to be with God that's how long the Holy
[40:53] Spirit steals you not from revival to
[40:57] revival but from the eternity to
[40:59] eternity you're sealed by the Holy
[41:02] Spirit that's what the Holy Spirit is
[41:05] it's the seal of God that he's found you
[41:09] found grace in his sight and he loves
[41:12] you and he believes you and he's putty
[41:14] sealer for you
[41:16] what is the seal anyone or seal
[41:20] designates our means of finished work
[41:28] God has saved you sanctified you cleans
[41:31] you up and in favor with UNCG's finished
[41:35] you're his product until the day of your
[41:40] Redemption yield is the finished thing
[41:44] what is the Holy Ghost it's a sign we're
[41:49] going to get on that little later on or
[41:51] another message the sign that Paul spoke
[41:53] out tongues of the sign to believers
[41:56] right now notice but in this the Holy
[42:01] Ghost is a sign I mean and the Holy
[42:05] Ghost is a seal it's a sign that God
[42:10] gave to his chosen sure you reject it is
[42:15] to be cut from the people I'm to receive
[42:19] it is to be finished with the world
[42:25] and to be a product that God has put a
[42:32] seal of approval on I used to work on
[42:36] the railroad I here with Harry Waterbury
[42:38] and we would go down to load a car my
[42:44] brother died standing back there Epps
[42:47] loads cars when a car's being loaded
[42:51] they go through that car the inspector
[42:55] and if he finds anything loose wart or
[42:58] fall and break or anything that was
[43:00] destroyed he'll not seal that car until
[43:06] that car is so completely packed until
[43:11] it's so packed down and so it harder
[43:16] that's the shaking of the ride won't
[43:19] bother the product that's on the inside
[43:24] that's what's the matter we don't get
[43:26] seal so much weird you loose about
[43:29] things when the inspector goes through
[43:37] to inspect your life to see if you're
[43:41] not just a little loose about things a
[43:43] little loose about your prayer life a
[43:45] little loose about that temper a little
[43:48] loose about that time to talk about
[43:50] other he'll never seal the car some
[43:56] dirty habits some bow things some vulgar
[44:02] T mind he can't seal the car but when
[44:07] he's found everything his place the
[44:11] inspector then he seals it yeah be
[44:18] anybody open that seal until that car's
[44:24] reached its destination of words seal
[44:26] for there it is touch not my anointed do
[44:34] my prophets no harm or I say unto you
[44:37] would be better for you
[44:38] that a millstone was hanging at your
[44:40] neck and you were drowned in the depths
[44:42] of the season even to try to a fin or
[44:46] shake a little on the least of these
[44:50] that's been sealed you see what it means
[44:56] that's what the Holy Spirit is it's your
[44:59] assurance
[45:00] it's your protection it's your witness
[45:04] it's your seat it's your sign I'm heaven
[45:13] bound Wow he seen me he gave it to me
[45:20] he sealed me into his kingdom and glory
[45:24] bound that's a window let's say do what
[45:29] he wants to God's done seal neat all the
[45:32] day of my Redemption hey man
[45:36] that's what the Holy Ghost is oh you
[45:39] should want it I couldn't go on without
[45:43] it so much could be said there but I'm
[45:48] sure you know what I'm speaking of now
[45:53] also let us turn to John 14 just for a
[45:57] minute I just love the word it's the
[46:05] truth now the Spirit of God the Holy
[46:14] Ghost what is the Holy Ghost it is the
[46:19] Spirit of Christ in you

[46:28] commenting words here what is the Holy
[46:31] Ghost to see you what is the Holy Ghost
[46:34] it's a covenant what is the Holy Ghost
[46:37] it's a sign what is the Holy Ghost and
[46:41] if a the spirit of Jesus Christ in you
[46:50] a little wild said Jesus said the world
[46:53] sees me no more yet you shall see me or
[46:58] I will be with you even in you to the
[47:03] end of the world fear of God in His
[47:09] Church what far what did you do it for
[47:12] this is a little long tomorrow night
[47:13] subject well what did he do it Paul why
[47:17] did he why did the Holy Spirit well why
[47:21] did he come for what did he come in you
[47:23] Paul what did he come in me for wants to
[47:27] continue the works are bound I always do
[47:32] that which is pleasing to my father I
[47:35] come not to do my own will but the
[47:37] father that sent me and the father that
[47:40] sent me is with me and as my father has
[47:44] sent me so send the father sent him when
[47:53] any the father that sent Jesus came any
[47:57] work to him that Jesus that sent you
[48:01] goes with you and is in you and if that
[48:07] spirit living in Jesus Christ may him do
[48:11] an act the way he did you'll have some
[48:13] general idea how to do when it's in you
[48:16] those that life cannot change it'll go
[48:19] from body to body but it cannot change
[48:22] its nature or it is gone now in John 14
[48:27] is let's read just a little bit
[48:29] beginning of the tenth verse believe us
[48:32] doubt that I am in the father and the
[48:35] father in me the works the words that I
[48:39] speak unto you I speak not of myself but
[48:43] the father that dwelleth in me he doeth
[48:45] the works think of it now believe me
[48:50] that I am in the father and the father
[48:52] in me or else believe me for the very
[48:55] works sake barely barely I say on you he

[49:02] that I do shall he also and greater
[49:05] works than these shall he do because I

[49:29] father may be glorified in the son
[49:31] if you shall ask anything in my name
[49:33] I'll do if you love me keep my
[49:35] Commandments and I will pray the father
[49:38] I watch and he shall give you another
[49:43] comforter that he may abide with you
