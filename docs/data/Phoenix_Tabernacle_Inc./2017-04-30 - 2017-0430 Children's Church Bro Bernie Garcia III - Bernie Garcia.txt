risen he is alive he is a li your mic's not on if there are words for him then I don't have them you see my brain has not yet reached a point where it can form a thought that could adequately describe the greatness of my God and my lungs have not yet developed the ability to release a breath with enough agility to breathe out the greatness of his love and my voice my voice is so inhibited restrained by human limits that it's it's hard to even send a praise up if there are words for him then I don't have them my God his grace is remarkable mercies are innumerable strength is impenetrable he is Honorable accountable and favorable unsearchable yet knowable indefinable yet approachable Indescribable yet personal he is beyond comprehension further than imagination constant through generations king of every nation but if there are words for him then I don't have them you see my words are few and to try and capture the one true God using my vocabulary will never do but I use my words as an expression an expression of worship to a savior a savior who is both worthy and deserving of my praise so I use words my heart exols the Lord blesses his name forever he has won my heart captured my mind and has bound them both together he has defeated my Rebellion conquered me for sin he has welcomed me into his presence completely invited me in he has made himself the object of my sight flooding me with Mercies in the morning amen drowning me with Grace in the night but if there are words to him then I don't have them but what I do have is good news for my God knew that man-made words would never do the words is just tools that we use to point to the truth he sent his son Jesus Christ as the word yes living he is the image of the invisible God the firstborn of all creation for by him all things were created giving nothingness formation but by his word he sustains in the power of His name for he is before all things and over all things he reigned holy is his name praise him for his life the way he persevered and strife The Humble Son of God becoming the perfect sacrifice praise him for his death amen that he willingly stood in our place that he lovingly endured the grave that he battled our enemy and on the third day Rose in Victory praise him he is everything that was promised praise him as the Risen King lift your voice and sing for one day he will return to us and we will finally be United with our savior for eternity so it's not just words that I Proclaim from my words point to the word and the word has a name yes he hope has a name Joy has a name peace has a name love has a name and that name is Jesus [Music] Christ forever he is Glory forever he is Liv High forever he Isis is alive he is alive the ground began to shake the stone was rolled away perfect love could not be overcome now death where is your a resurrected King has rered you decet forever he is forever he is lifted High forever he is RIS he is alive he is [Music] alive amen how many know that Jesus Christ is alive and he lives and forever he is glorified and forever wants to be the Savior the Lord and the king of your heart how many would like to for these dry bones
