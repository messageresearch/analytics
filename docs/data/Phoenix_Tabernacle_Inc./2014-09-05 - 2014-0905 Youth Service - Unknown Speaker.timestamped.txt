[16:31] Holy
[16:33] Ghost Liberate the
[16:36] minds and they're captured by the
[16:39] enemy may they be
[16:41] delivered and any anything or any that
[16:44] they're asking
[16:45] for that your children are looking or
[16:51] asking you may
[16:53] granted as your word is being
[16:56] spoken faith comes by he hearing the
[16:58] word of
[17:00] God thank you Lord help me and help my
[17:04] interpreter and bless the reading of
[17:06] your
[17:07] word in the name of Jesus
[17:10] Christ amen amen it reads like this and
[17:14] it came to pass when the children of
[17:15] Israel cried on to the Lord because of
[17:17] the
[17:23] meites that the Lord sent a prophet unto
[17:26] the children of Israel which said unto
[17:27] them thus say the Lord God of Israel I
[17:29] brought you up from Egypt and brought
[17:31] you forth out of the house of
[17:45] bondage and I delivered you out of the
[17:47] hand of the Egyptians and out of the
[17:49] hand of all that oppressed you and drave
[17:52] them out from the from before you and
[17:55] gave them their their land oh
[18:07] and I said unto you I am the Lord your
[18:09] God fear not the gods of the amorites in
[18:11] whose land you dwell but ye have not
[18:13] obeyed my
[18:23] voice and there came an angel of the
[18:25] Lord and sat under an oak which was an
[18:27] ala and pertain onto Josh the appi as
[18:31] right and his son Gideon trashed Wheat
[18:34] by the trashed Wheat by the wine press
[18:36] to hide it from the
[18:53] mandes and the angel of the Lord
[18:55] appeared onto him and said unto him the
[18:57] Lord is with thee thou might th Mighty
[18:59] Man of
[19:06] Valor and Gideon said unto him oh my
[19:08] Lord if the Lord be with us why then is
[19:12] all all this befallen us and where be
[19:14] all these Miracles which our father told
[19:16] us of saying did not the Lord bring us
[19:18] up from Egypt but now the Lord hath
[19:20] forsaken us and delivered us unto the
[19:22] hands of the
[19:27] maites
[19:44] and the Lord looked upon him and said go
[19:46] on this thy might and thou shalt save
[19:48] Israel from the hand of the manad ites
[19:50] have not sent
[19:57] thee
[20:01] I bless the one of his word you may be
[20:05] seated if I can put a text to my message
[20:09] tonight I like to like brother brand
[20:12] entitles
[20:14] this if God be with us then where is all
[20:17] the
[20:19] Miracles I think that's a tremendous
[20:22] question that every person has every
[20:26] single one of us has questions
[20:29] so many questions and as a youth how
[20:33] many questions is is is in the
[20:36] mind but brother Bram says when there's
[20:39] a question there's an answer when
[20:42] there's a Biblical
[20:44] question in the scriptures there must be
[20:47] the
[20:48] answer in the scriptures don't look
[20:51] anywhere
[20:52] else look to the
[20:55] word we have so many questions if God be
[20:59] with us then where is all the
[21:01] Miracles we read the scripture here in
[21:05] judges a Mighty Man by the name of
[21:08] Gideon and he he was he was
[21:13] oppressed that's what brother Bram says
[21:15] the devil likes to oppress
[21:18] you and that's what happened brother
[21:20] Bram says
[21:21] Israel got away from the
[21:24] word they they they got away from God
[21:28] and the spirit left them and so what
[21:30] happened with this little what this man
[21:33] did he worked in the
[21:35] fields he work in the field so what he
[21:37] so what that's what he that that was his
[21:39] job and that was his food he will he
[21:42] will he will he will put plant the seed
[21:44] and he would get his
[21:46] Harvest but the problem was that the
[21:49] amorites and all these different nation
[21:51] was will come and take all of his
[21:55] Harvest imagine that you were all year
[21:59] you're throwing the water and you work
[22:01] so hard and here comes here comes the
[22:04] here comes the
[22:05] enemy and he takes everything how many
[22:08] of you
[22:10] work that's good you need to pay your

[22:22] ones who work you better you understand
[22:23] me a lot

[22:30] tired and finally here comes Friday it's
[22:33] time for
[22:34] payday and you come and pick up your
[22:37] paycheck and they say no they already
[22:38] took it for
[22:40] you imagine how that feels they already
[22:43] took my paycheck you you work for that
[22:46] money you work for it and somebody else
[22:50] takes it it's time for us to do
[22:53] something brother brand says the devil
[22:57] can't set a foot on
[23:00] you and hurt you until you get away from
[23:05] God my goodness brother brandom
[23:09] says check your
[23:11] life check your faith and
[23:16] remember that the devil cannot harm you
[23:19] unless you're in
[23:21] Christ brother I'm reading from the
[23:23] quote a messages brother brandom that
[23:25] God be with us his miracles
[23:30] and then that angel appeared onto
[23:33] Gideon cuz he he he came a little
[23:36] thought to him he said you know what you
[23:38] know what Dad this what we're going to
[23:40] do this is what we're going to do I'm
[23:42] I'm I'm starting to see the schedule of

[23:50] going to we're going to reap and S
[23:51] before time before SE before they come

[23:58] and then the angel of the Lord
[24:00] descended he said the Lord is with you
[24:04] the Mighty Man of
[24:06] Valor tremendous the the angel of the
[24:08] Lord
[24:09] descended you're
[24:11] tremendous a mighty man of
[24:14] Valor that you

[24:18] time before the enemy
[24:20] came wow you're tremendous and he says
[24:24] God is with thee he said oh no no no
[24:27] this
[24:28] what do you mean God with me and why
[24:31] have we bef
[24:32] Fallen where are where are those stories
[24:34] that I
[24:35] hear that my mom us to tell me that they
[24:38] were a Prophet by the name of
[24:41] Moses and he took out my
[24:44] ancestors and he opened the Red Sea what
[24:47] happened to those stories if God is with
[24:50] me where are those
[24:53] stories brother brandom says the prophet
[24:57] Divine
[24:58] interpreter of the word of God and
[25:01] brothers and sisters brother Bram says
[25:05] look what you are right
[25:08] now look how you are right now in the
[25:10] condition and that's what you would have
[25:12] been back
[25:14] then brother brand said many people say
[25:18] if there were 13 if it was in the time
[25:19] of
[25:21] Jesus there would have been 13 disciples
[25:24] and there was in the time of Noah there
[25:26] would have been nine in the ark
[25:28] but what are you doing right now what
[25:30] are you right now think about
[25:34] it you backstab your
[25:36] brother you talk bad about your brother
[25:39] and that's what you would have been back
[25:41] then and the attitude in the position
[25:43] that you are right
[25:44] now would have been back a prophet
[25:49] brother Bram always SP with the biblical
[25:53] patterns he did not leave Jesus Christ
[25:55] in the
[25:56] grave he did not leave them in the pages
[25:58] of the
[25:59] Bible he always brought it present
[26:02] tense right here
[26:04] present where the shoe
[26:07] fits brother Brown says when I think
[26:09] about
[26:10] Samson I think about the
[26:12] church he always brings it
[26:15] present and that's what a prophet
[26:18] does was thinking about the
[26:20] past oh I heard about Egypt and Moses
[26:24] and Elijah and the
[26:26] Miracles and he said what about right
[26:28] now the Lord is with you Jesus Christ is
[26:33] the same yesterday today and forever he
[26:38] does not stay in the
[26:40] past present when he told
[26:43] Moses Moes said what should I tell them
[26:46] who sent me said not that I
[26:49] was not that I might be not that I
[26:52] probably will be he said that I
[26:55] am present right now brothers and
[27:00] sisters we always think about the past
[27:03] we always think of the future what about
[27:06] right
[27:07] now Brothers if God is with us and where
[27:11] are his
[27:12] miracles he says isn't that a good
[27:15] picture of the church
[27:18] today but brother it's time for
[27:21] Action I like how brother BR preaches I
[27:25] like how he
[27:26] preaches and he says that's that's the
[27:28] same
[27:29] now now you see he brings a present the
[27:34] time has come for
[27:36] Action the time has come that we need to
[27:39] stop playing
[27:40] [Applause]
[27:43] church it's time for that to come to a
[27:48] halt there's no more playing
[27:50] church we must get down to
[27:54] business and I trust the same God will
[27:59] plac that upon this upon our
[28:02] hearts tonight to have to put a
[28:06] halt and playing
[28:09] Church playing

[28:33] here but when we makes it hot is that
[28:37] the presence of the Lord in this
[28:40] place all right and he says now we find
[28:45] that when God's
[28:46] people gets in
[28:48] trouble he sends a prophet with the
[28:52] word he sends the
[28:54] prophet oh but then he said a prophet at
