TRANSCRIPT
========================================
You may be seated. Greet you tonight in the name of the Lord. Brother Bernie, today your birthday younger than I am, so I can tell you. &gt;&gt; Well, that's a bold. &gt;&gt; No, I don't think so. The brain just smiles on our speedometers. That's all right. I just got 117 days old. We were both born in 1933. I'm pretty &gt;&gt; 25 years old 58. We want you to take this $500 and spend it on yourself. That's probably that's not an offering to the church. Not an offering to your wife. &gt;&gt; Has to be spent on yourself. Buy something you want and need from all of us. God bless you. [Music]
