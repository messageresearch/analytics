V you maybe see them in a Lord PLAs you suppose I'm sorry et al singles bendiga recommended more of judgment because the prince of this world is judged mom now they advocate found in in first John 2:12 now let's read that just a minute first John 2 and 12 I beg your pardon 1st John 1 and 2 there's I've got these wrote down first John 2:1 to tune my little children these things write on to you that you sin not and if any man sin we have an advocate with the father Jesus Christ the righteous who is advocate Jesus Christ the righteous and he is he is there a propitiation for our sins and not for ours only but also for the sins of the whole world what is the Holy Ghost it's an advocate what doesn't what isn't advocator what does it do make an advocate it has mercy it stands in your place it does things that you can't do it's it's a propitiation or your sin it's your righteousness it's your healing it's your life it's your resurrection it's all that God has for you he's an advocate now we could go into details with that and break that down of how that one it makes intercession for our ignorance sometimes we got the Holy Ghost we eagerly stagger into something the Holy Spirit started to make advocate for us he is our educator he stands our he's our attorney he stands there and pleads for us we don't plead for herself because the Holy Ghost in us pleads for us the Holy Spirit given utterance sometimes those words you can't understand and he makes intercession sparse that's what the Holy Ghost is when I walk in anything I walk like a little kid you walk like a little seller we're walking in a dark world full of enemies full of sin full of traps full of everything you say oh I'm afraid I'm afraid to take creature night I'm afraid to this I'm afraid I'll do this don't be afraid we have an advocate oh he spends by us he's at us and he makes intercession for us the Holy Spirit constantly constantly making an advocate for us all the time he is our educator oh how we thank confidence a seal a sign the spirit of life the God of heaven the comforter the lion the advocate what is he oh my we could go on for hours with it now we're going to change just for a minute now we're going to ask now promised to us in the last days this advocate he'll promise everything that we have talked about him tonight with 10,000 times more it was made a promise to us in the last days they didn't have it in that day they just had a seal in their flesh as a token and a sign believing it was coming and they walked by the shadow of the law which they were circumcised by flesh the day we don't walk by the shadow the law we walk by the power of the Resurrection we walk by the power of the Spirit who is our true seal our true advocate our true comforter our true sign that we have been born from above peculiar odd people acting funny taking God at His Word pulling everything else wrong God's words right that's all ma that's what the Holy Ghost do you want it would you love to have it let's see if it was promised now let's go back to Isaiah The Book of Isaiah let's get the 28th chapter of Isaiah now we're going to Isaiah 28 and we're going to begin about the let's take the eighth verse see what Isaiah said seven hundred and twelve years before it come we could say a lot about this go back all the way back but we'll just start by here and see if it was promised to the church what day wasn't supposed to come upon the life stage when there'd be a a corruption now I remember the words in plural days the last two days the last 2,000 years now not the eighth first all for all tables are full of filthiness told that there is no clean place Church around today he to find it look around see free in that day all tables while they go to the Lord's Supper and the first thing in the material line take an old piece of light bread or a soda cracker and break it up and make the communion when that's supposed to be made with Holy Ghost hands and on eleven bread Christ is not dirty and filthy and that represents you another thing they give it to people that drink la piel boom jus-just anything as long as they belong to the church or being if a man ever takes it when we're reading this sure he's reading and drinking damnation to himself not discerning the Lord's body they don't live the life keep away from it and if you don't take it it shows that your own conscience is guilty he that he does not has no mark with me Jesus death but all tables of the Lord has become full of Filth there's no one clean place listen if that don't picture today whom shall he who shall he teach knowledge and whom shall eat make understand doctrine who will understand knowledge who can he make to understand doctrine but bless God on Presbyterian on Methodist I'm Pentecostal I'm Nazarene I'm pilgrim holiness that don't mean one thing to God just another table who'll I make no one doctor what kind of doctor Methodist Baptist Presbyterian Pentecostal the doctrine of the Bible who will I make knowing doctrine how do you know when you got it we'll get into that Friday night who will I make knowing doctrine i watch damn bed or weaned from the milk and drawn from the breasts little babies say well I go to church my mama belong to this church I have nothing against that dear brother I realize this is being taped that's all right longer Mama's Church but listen mama walked in one light you're walking in another Luther walked in one night wesley walked in another wesley walked in one light pentecost walked in another but we were walking on higher than that today and if there's another generation will go beyond us back in the early days when the thing was wide way wide Luther taught justification by faith that was just to bring the people from Catholicism in to Protestantism into the fellowship around the word justification by faith as a big wide fear they never moved from that along came another revival closed John Wesley it shook him down from that brought her down to vacation leave a good clean holy line Thank You five by the Word of God gives joy in your heart that's shucks awful out of a Lutheran doctrine then a long time Pentecost with the baptism of Holy Ghost and narrowed it down again by receiving the Holy Ghost that's right and now that's begin to shake down and the gifts and the restoration and the Spirit of God has come in in the fullness of signs and wonders into the church and shuck Pentecost what is it we were so close to coming out of the Lord Jesus until the very spirit that was anything is working in the church doing the very same things that he did when he was your honor it's never been any word back from the time of the Apostles till this time fine it's why Narrows Mary Sarah what is it just like your hand come into a shadow the negative negative negative or what is - it's a reflection what was Luther a reflection of crime what was Wesley a reflection of crime look Billy Sunday's agent just ended the other day old dr. Whitley's taught right here on this pulpit the last one of the old school died around 90 again Billy Sunday was the revivalist to the nominal churches of his day he called all punches stand up then horror all you Methodists hit the sawdust rail preachers and all all you Baptists hit the sawdust trail he Presbyterians he pulled no punches he was the Billy Graham of this day notice and then the same time as a number of churches having their revival or taken place the full gospel is having a revival there come forth the Bosworth brothers miss wiglesworth and dr. prize Amy McPherson although look this legal work died one night dr. price died the next morning was in 24 hours I was on the field down my ends coming down look at you don't hear much of it agree and they don't hear much of all Oral Roberts I see my meeting shattering what's the matter we're at the end of another age how did Billy Sunday come in and then they come in just after great Moody when did moody come in just after Knox revival here when the Knox come in just after finish revival city after Calvin Calvin after so Wesley and Wesley after Luther on down through the ages come as soon as one revivals over God raises up another and throw in full right just keeps moving like that now we're at the end of this time each man has looked at the end of the injunction for the coming of Christ but they had a lot to look forward to the returning of the Jews sighing soldiers in the skies all the things that we see today but we're at the end them we are here now they know the church was a sieve power that would work in the church the same works of crime because as the shadow becomes deeper and deeper and respects more you take a shade farther away the shape the least reflection you get out of the shade after a while the shakiest closer closer to the tree in the shade is the same thing now the Spirit of God has worked under justification under loser thanks to the keishon under Wesley the baptism Holy Ghost under Pentecost and Garrett is in the last day performing and doing the very same thing that it did when it was in Christ the church in Christ has become one and as soon as they connect together that last link she'll go through the sky shopping up will come Wesley loser all rest them back in those days there he that first will be life he that slice will be first and there will come the resurrection we're at the end time listen that's what the Holy Ghost does the Holy Ghost by justification ceases to like shadow of it the Holy Ghost by sanctification a little deeper shadow the Holy Ghost Father baptism out of it a deeper shadow now the Holy Ghost by the restoration of its very person being in here forming signs and wonders I get into the beginning listen brother listen to this all tables are full of vomit there's no clean place who shall he teach knowledge whom shall he makes no one understand doctrine damn that are weaned from the milk and drawn from the breasts not little babies Presbyterian babies Methodist babies Pentecostal baby Lutheran babies Nazarene baby he wants somebody willing to get away from the breath nice and strong nice here comes our precip must be upon precept upon precept line upon line upon line here a little and there a little far with stammering lips and other tongues will I speak to this people new movie says this is the rest worrying you make calls are weary to rest and this is the refreshing yet they would not hear the holy spirit that that isn't just the way it come on the day of Pentecost coffee side seven hundred and twelve years before come here it is on the day of Pentecost comes just exactly somebody said keeping the Sabbath day I'm not rejecting they're making light of anybody's church or religion but said the Sabbath day the Sabbath of God was arresting here's the resting this is the rest he said that you calls the weary to rest this is it [Music] come on to me all ye that labor and are heavy-laden what is he the one

seal you're at rest you have your advocate if you something happen see there's something you got to make an advocate for you right quick see making intercession it's a spirit of God living in the church prophesied exactly what it would be when it come it would be a everlasting eternal rest God made the world Hebrews the fourth chapter God made the world and rested on the seventh day that's right they stayed come back round honor you give that to the Jews for a covenant for a certain amount of time Ryan but they go and rest one day go back to the first day of the week start over again news start oh that is terrific God spoke up when God made the world in six days when he went to rest he rested from that home drying that settled it he didn't come back on the eighth day and start again it was only a shadow now that was a tight like the moon to the Sun but when the Sun comes up we don't need the moving no more now notice this on revelations 11 the woman with the moon under a feet in the side of her head oh we could go through the Bible we led to live and show you these but what is it when the Bible said in Hebrews the fourth chapter if Jesus would have given them a rest day he would the spoke of it he would have spoken to their state what day did he speak about arrests come unto me all ye that Labour and I will give you rest then we find that when we come to him for he said he brews for that is entered into Jesus rest as cease from his worldly works as God did from his honey made the world doesn't ever return to it again how how are you see you by the Holy Ghost until the day of your Redemption there is that comfort abdicate feel deliver I get kind of excited I get County blessed oh is this promise part for the band isn't it proven by the Bible all right let's go to Joelle find out what Joel said about it how thankful I am for the Blessed Word of God do you love it I think if it wasn't for the word I don't know where we stand all right we're Joel now we're going to Joel the second chapter of Joel and we're going to start at the twenty eighth verse go to twenty eight eight hundred years before the coming of Christ the prophet in the spirit now listen and it shall come to pass add words that I will pour out my spirit upon all flesh your sons and your daughters shall prophesy your old men shall dream dreams and your young men shall see visions and also upon my servants and upon my has made well I pour out in these days pour out in those days my spirits and I will show wonders in the heavens above and in the earth blood fire and pillars of smooth the Sun shall be turned into darkness and the moon into blood before the great and terrible day of the Lord shall come and it shall come to pass and whosoever shall call upon the name of Lord shall be delivered Oh what goal did you notice an axe to Peter tuck up the same verse said ye men of Israel hear my word these are not jokes this acute marked people they are not drunk as you suppose x2 think this is a third hour of the day but this is that which is Foca by Joel the Prophet saying it shall come to pass in the last days that I'll pour out my spirit upon all flesh what is it what is the Holy Ghost all right now let's notice again promised to the believers that's what it is now this Holy Ghost we find out what it is just a minute who is it promise to to believers now let's go to Luke 24 chapter of Luke listen what Jesus said in his last words before he left the earth Luke the 24th chapter you just taking this down down you can mark it down and study it tomorrow when you had more time now Luke 24:49 listen to Jesus speaking at the end when he was ascending up into glory the Ascension hears the words he said to his disciple behold I send the promise of my father was promised the seal the son the comforter and all these things that have spoke of times thousands more I send the promise of my father upon what promise the one that Isaiah said would come with Stanley and other times I speak to these people I'll send that rest upon you I'll stand watch your spoke up and it shall come to pass away they say if God I'll pour out my spirit upon you oh I'll send to you and make all nations all people to getting from Jerusalem I'll bring in the seed of Abraham under this covenant I'll see you away every one of them the I'll pour out my spirit I'll send the promise of my father upon you but tarry need means wait in the city of Jerusalem until you are endued with power from on high what is the Holy Ghost and power not power from the bishop not power from the church but power from on high how did that power come by journée church I challenge you to do Savior that's right but joining the church shaking hands with a preacher no sir now do you Catholic thinking out your tongue and taking the first communion no sir how did it come time that's three little party let's go to acts 1:8 they're swimming together now now they were speaking of Jesus here when they were symbol together and it's ordained another to take the Judas's plate acts 1:8 but he shall receive power after this the Holy Ghost is come upon you what you become the member of the bad random tavern it now you become the member of the Methodist Church the Catholic Church a Presbyterian not so in the Bible that's man-made doctrine but you shall receive power after you have become a preacher no sir you shall receive power after you get your bachelor of art no sir you shall become power after you get your DD no sir you shall receive power if you're baptized in water no sir you shall receive power after you in the first communion no sir vs all man-made stuff this is what the Bible said while jesus said ye shall receive power after that the Holy Ghost is come upon you what is the Holy Ghost of power then after this you shall be witnesses just you 12 you'll witness at Jerusalem you shall be witnesses to me both in Jerusalem Judea Samaria and to the uttermost parts of the earth which has never been reached tip when you spoken these things when he spoken these things while they beheld him he was taken up in the cloud and received out of their sight now turn not across the page what's these prophecies come to pass and when the day of Pentecost had fully come they were one they were all with one Accord in one place and all of a sudden the pastor came in and got off the line there didn't it all of a sudden the priest come on the altar and suddenly there came a sound not just to make believe it was there a sound a minister was approaching the door the priest had the community coming out of their holy place there came a sound from heaven not to rustling of a feet there came a sound from heaven as a rushing mighty wind and it filled all the house were there what is the holy goalie dares where they get power here's where they supposed to wait here's what happened when they did it all prophesied from Genesis I don't up becoming the results would come what is it promised to the church he believers and filled all the house where there was and there appeared unto them cloven tongues like a fire and is set upon each of them and they were all filled with the Holy Ghost and began to speak with other tongues as the Spirit gave them utterance now we go getting on that Friday night we leave that right there how is it it's a promise to the church absolutely a promise all right now now we go to find out after they were stilled they were sealed on till how long how many years got the Holy Ghost I see your hands there's more with the Holy Ghost for years without we want you to be one of us brother sister when you understand what it is if it is the Spirit of God dwelling in you to do the works of God when God ever sent any of his spirit into any of his servants any of his prophets any of these teachers and the apostles they were always rejected of the world they were considered crazy and every age there was anyone when power stood before Griffith he said in the way that's called heresy what is heresy crazy in the way that they call crazy a bunch of nuts that's the way I'll worship the God of our fathers I'm so glad that I can say I'm one of them that's right I'm so glad I can say I'm one of them now answer this Holy Ghost fell upon him it made them so much sweethearts until everything was in common is that right we sing that song time time they didn't care they didn't care whether they the Sun shined or didn't they didn't ask for a flower better bees out I'll receive the Holy Ghost says some people to me mr. random if you will guarantee me that I'll be a millionaire if you'll guarantee me I'll find our Wells and if I find gold mines and I see people teach that in their pizza ride God has not promised those things man has ever received the Holy Ghost don't carry babies for bread or not doesn't make a difference to him he's a heaven bound creature [Music] you don't care let come let go what may let them criticize make fun lose your breath see why do you care on your own to glory how do your your eyes are set on Christ and you're on your own you don't care what the world says that's what the Holy Ghost is it's a power it's a seal it's a comforter it's an advocate it's assurance God has received you how much time if I take I've got just eight more minutes all right baby I got a lot of scriptures here I don't guess I'm getting in but we will try our bed down after a man has been filled with the Holy Ghost is it possible that persecutions and things would cause him to have to come back in now he ain't gonna lose he's still a son of God he'll always be but cause you're sealed how long I'm trying that's what the Bible day now as the disciple have been beaten moths made fun of and everything they thought it's time to go back together a little while let's turn over that that acts the fourth champion you see one day what happened now this is the you people's already go x2 fourth chapter ah Peter and John had been beaten puttan prison or healing having heating service eyes to gaze the church how they know that there's mainly and they're kind of lame and he steamed and cooked wall been that way for 40 years and Peter passed you and he said a lot he's got to get something put in these cups for food and Peter showed that he was a holy ghost still preacher he didn't have any money he said he said silver and gold have I none he wasn't cared about that but he was a a heaven bound creature oh how I wish we had time to leave he was heaven bound he was comforting he had the spirit he adds of power you've all gone said silver and gold have I none but such as I have I'll give to you no doubts an instant what you got - I got segment I've got something in my heart that started about 10 days ago I was in the upper room up there and all the sudden all the promises that God made I've walked with Jesus Christ for three and a half years I feast with him out pulling in the feet I've done these different things and I've seen heal the sick I he kept telling me the father's envy but when I leave he'll coming you but I couldn't understand that but he said I don't expect you to understand it you don't understand these things you just give him I don't understand it yet and don't tell me you do because you don't think so I can't understand it I can't explain it but one thing I know I got it was you say that's not scientifically oh sure it is look at that life when Benjamin Franklin called it he said I got it he didn't know what he had but he had it and I want somebody tell me tonight what lectricity is they don't know yet what it is but we got it that's right there's no man knows what lectricity is they can harness it make it light make it burn they can act but it's it's generated by generators to pieces running together like that it produces that and that's all they know it'll give my it's got power in it that's like the Spirit of God when you get one piece is you the other piece is God and get them lying around together like that it'll do something for you it'll give light it'll give power you don't know what it is never will know what it is but you don't you got it that's one thing sure and it's firing it's yours it says sure what's that light show there's assurance that is aligning now notices you don't know what it is but these fella said well did they said one thing they know we know that they're injured more nuts you see like that though German said he was see that they're injured and unlearned in but they've been with that fisherman that carpenter talk Jesus I tell you because they're doing the same things he does that's what the Holy Ghost is is Jesus living in the eager fishermen a carton dirt or whatever injured preacher whatever it is it's a man that wants to be eager to the things of the world and I thought of Jesus come into him the Spirit of God the seal the comforter he don't care about prestige all thing he wants his Bob when God was sitting in order he said all you Levi I've called you out make you free and all your brothers whether twelve tribes and all other 11 tribes or pay your tithing when you get a book nine bushel apples or one bushel to the Levites when you run your sheep to this all here pick up the fifth sheep I don't care if it's a lunar or a big ones back we're poor one that belongs to Levi I'll Levite when you get all this then you've ties to to the Lord you make the wave offering the heave offering the different offerings you ties to the Lord that Moses for your part I am yours he said I'm your satisfying potion that's what the Holy Ghost is to the church today education I can't want to read this book but I got a satisfying potion doctors agree I don't have any bah these realities are nothing else what is one thing is a satisfying potion that's the part I won't that's the part God wants you to have so the rest of these old things away all the fresh things and everything you have to walk out and get God satisfying potions tell us what you've got a desert but if you've got that satisfying potion or take you out just this we're always taking out insurance to take to give the Undertaker let's get God satisfying potion and get the uptake or instead of the Undertaker's man you know they both work not a scene being that gold they went to their own companies not back to the priests see that show they had it they wasn't going back that old coal formal thing again no go back and say no looking at what they did that no they had our own companies only about a dozen up in there but that was a company enough a little bit a handful of people being let go actually beat him and threatened them that if you were ever a baptized in Jesus name again or oh I miss that's right see if you ever preach in Jesus name again whatever you do will get you let's gorge the rest of brothers all that's the way and unity there's power and unity is there's power lets us go over to the rest of the better and find out what we can do now they all come together was telling different experiences being let go they went to their own company and reported all that the chief priests and elders had said unto them and when they had heard that they lifted up their voices to God with one Accord listen what they said watching watching not go back and say all something another about Oh Lord I'm so sorry no you're already saved they were filled with the spirit ed eternal I've lifted up their voice with one Accord and said Lord our God our God we know that which has made heavens and earth and the sea and all that in them is through by the mouth of thy servant David said I want you to come back to now we're honor now you go out there and say well my lord no wait a minute here there just make so much fun of me didn't he say they'd do it all that live godly in Christ Jesus shall suffer persecution if he go didn't they say they'd see this well you know they've drawn me in the court the other day about it did he say you'd be brought before kings and rulers for money take the old thought watch your say because it's not you that's speaking I've seen that happen yesterday it's the Holy Spirit that dwells in you he'll do as the speaking that's trying all right hey go thought watches your face Lord mouth of our servant David has said why did the heathen rage and the people imagine a vain thing the kings of the earth stood up and the rulers gathered together against the Lord and against his Christ I'll the truth Lord against our Holy Child Jesus thou has anointed both Herod and Pontius Pilate with the Gentiles and the people of Israel gather together or to do whatsoever is down and then doubt Council has determined before to be done oh I like that why the Bible send the last day's outcomes call first 30 high-minded lovers of pleasure more than lovers of God to fakers false accusers incontinent despisers of those that are good having a form of godliness but denied you don't want to burn receive power it's this the Holy Ghost has come upon you having a form of godliness but denying Parador up from such turn away that's what the Holy Ghost is the what is determined to be done now Lord behold they're threatening and grant unto thy servants that with all boldness we may speak thy word oh I like that get that old wishbone out and get a real backbone in there and I want you we may speak that words by touching forth thy hand to heal oh brother demons don't die but the Holy Ghost on either vets and forth on hand to heal that signs and wonders may be done by the name of the Holy Child Jesus you see what this person about don't you they're doing the same thing today but don't do a bit of good and when they had prayed the place was shaken where they were a symbol together and they were all filled with the Holy Ghost and the promise said that's what the Holy Ghost is they give you bolding they give you a comfort Cecelia give you a sign listen Oh wish we just had time we go down but Philip to the Samaritans and acts 8:14 the old puppy down they had received a great joy then had great healing but they had been baptized in the name of Jesus Christ but they sent up to Jerusalem to get Peter he come down and laid hands on him and they receive the Holy Ghost Acts 8:14 the Gentiles there was one of the name of carnelian he was a wonderful man paid tithing built synagogues for the people respected God feared God a good man good Presbyterian methodist bad dis or something nothing a very good man but one day God said he's good man so I miss Corder sent him to your meeting I'll have to get my preacher over here and tell him about it all right so he saw visions say go down to Joplin and find one down there name Simon painter there's one Simon Peter next Betty come up here he'll tell you the way cause he's received something and while Peter stood up there Cornelius to go to worship that preacher he was Peter said stand up I'm a man like you are and while Peter yet spake these words to how they went back in the beginning it same things I'm talking about how God promised to poured out the Holy Ghost while he spake these words the Holy Ghost fell on me yeah that's what the Holy go see who is far sure and they were all filled with the Holy Ghost now notice in Ephesians that was a Baptist brother he is first a lawyer smart intelligent man knows the law rich man a scholar one day he got reading the Bible he's seen there become one by the name of the Messiah and when he did that one he began to hear about this Jesus he said I'm convinced now I only profess my faith that Jesus is the Christ the Son of God he was a real Bank area come on I openly profess that Jesus is the Christ you got to do it so much that God caught him in the ministry I'll always speak to a true heart and there was a little tip maker down there banana of Aquila and Priscilla a husband and wife David tentmakers Acts the 18th chapter tells you that Paul they were friends of his they had received the Holy Ghost or the hands of Paul in his teaching they heard this revival there so he went over is only about ten or twelve painting it so he went over there to look at and he heard this preacher preaching the sincerity as already said you know I agree he'd listen to the truth by his service or we call him out behind the tent and said look we got a little brother about so high a little hook-nosed view and but when he comes over here teaching the Word of God plainly well a child Paul was in jail at the same time awful faced room modernistic preacher wouldn't but he was in jail and Lord had him in there so absolute quake come shucks to jail down he took the jailer in his household and baptized and long name the Lord Jesus we call come on over and it just cast the devil to have a little old girl down there telling the fortune and then there's make a lot of money bar so he just expose their racket so then they put in jail fart Lord shucks to jail and alcohol he had a bunch of people who hear the truth you can't buy in God's Word there's no matter what you just can't you so he come over there to work this man wasn't a coolant for Silla maybe they had some sandwiches and right immediately activist languages each said we're going to reliable all set background Hill is a little old and listless Baptist preacher preach that's fine what you preach see some more of him said I want to ask you a question doctor Apollo's have you received the Holy Ghost since you believe he said we didn't know were there what do you mean by the Holy Ghost we're Baptist but how do you know your majesty well we was baptized we own the baptism of John he said he only baptized unto repentance they need to be bond him to come that's on Jesus Christ and when he urged this they were baptized over in the name of Jesus Christ and Paul ladies hands upon them and the Holy Ghost came on them and they spoke in tongues and prophesied now down how do we do it I want to tell you something I've told you I let you out early you don't want the Holy Ghost is for the last scripture far tonight I got another bunch down here but we'll have to omit that let's turn over to first Corinthians 12 and then we'll read this and then we all will close all right first corinthians the twelfth chapter how many breeds the teaching of st. paul he said in Galatians 1:18 for the angel caught a same difference let him be accursed let alone a preacher if an angel from heaven come down taught anything different let him be cursed don't have nothing to do with it now watch this first crazy is 12 how how many knows that we have stopped the beat in Christ an order to go on the reservation because it's his body they God promised to raise up a man there's no other way there's not another way if you're outside of crime you might look back here and believe on me they sure I believe him he's a son of God good my brother I'm ready to shake your hand when you say that I believe on him I'll confess him as my savior that's good but you're still not easy I'll shake hands with the preacher I'll confess my sins that's still and anything now watch see what Paul said how you get in crying how you going to be noted as a circumcision Abraham they give a sign listen to this now first Corinthians twelfth chapter and let's begin at the twelfth first far as the body is one has many members and all members of that one body being many are one body so also is Christ not divided one listen follow five one church some he's reading behind by one handshake by one water oh and somebody's wrong by one spirit into the capsule that's Holy Spirit by one spirit are we all baptized into one body whether we be Jews or Gentiles whether we be bond or free and have been all made to drink into one spirit the body of Christ is one spirit or every member from penne pasta this time drinks of the same new wine the same Holy Ghost bringing forth the strain wings off how do we do it by one theory if God opens door the Holy Spirit what is it if God opened doors if the sign if the seal is the comforter it's an advocate it's an assurance it's read it sees its goodness if healing is right it's God's opened door to all these things it's God's open door just Christ which has God through that he raised up Jesus from the dead and those that are dead in Christ will God bring with him at the resurrection grieve not the Holy Spirit till they are your Redemption how many pleases what is cry what is the Holy Ghost it's not something people laugh at it is some people like that but it ain't to the believers to the unbeliever I wish I had a long to the release I like take tomorrow night and tell you what it is to the unbeliever let me just run through just a moment of time it's a laughingstock it's a snare it's a summary box it's dead it's eternal separation from God I just can't think of the things that it is to the unbeliever remember the same ring that the unbeliever made fun of was the same ring that saved no and his face the same spirit Holy Ghost that people are making fun of and says it's crazy and a bunch of enough that's insanity if the same thing that'll rapture their church and take it up with the life States will bring judgment upon the unbelievers that's what the Holy Ghost is blessed are they may I say this in the sincerity in my heart blessed are they that do hunger and thirst for or they shall be filled and more night we're going to talk about ah what it does when he comes now how many in here would like to receive the Holy Ghost and wants somebody to pray for you that you'll see the light you know what it is now tomorrow night we're going to take what it does and then the next night if how to receive it then we're going to call in have people here instructed and go right into the rooms and stay there if it takes all to Christmas right until the Holy Ghost comes we're going to approach it from a same Bible foundation we're going to approach it and get it just like God promised it and it fell at the beginning that's the way we're here to do it ah those are making difference was anything the Word of God is has preeminence in my heart and I what God's got for me if he's anything more open heaven Lord's call about my heart's open for you that's right how many wants it now raise your hand say pray for me Oh why'd you remain with your hands up Heavenly Father we've taught a long time but your spirit is here there are hands it's up in the air now and they know what it is they know what the Holy Spirit means I pray God that before this meeting shall end that every hand in here will be raised that they have received it granite Lord we pray for them we ask you to bless them and to give them the desire of their heart look at their hands Lord they love you they want it they know they can't go tomorrow night if you'll help me Lord we could prove it in the scripture that they'll never make the rapture
