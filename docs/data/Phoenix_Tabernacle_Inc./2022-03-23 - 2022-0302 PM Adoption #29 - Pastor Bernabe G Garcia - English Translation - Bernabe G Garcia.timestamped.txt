[0:05] god bless you this morning
[0:08] let's pray to god
[0:09] may so that he can help us divine father
[0:13] we are this morning once again
[0:17] asking you to help us lord
[0:19] that
[0:20] your word be our food and
[0:24] nourishment may it be it that inspires
[0:26] us lord
[0:27] and that which we have may you be
[0:30] sufficient enough lord
[0:33] so that you can give us that what we
[0:35] need this morning through your word
[0:38] in the name of the lord jesus christ
[0:40] amen
[0:41] let's open up our bibles to leverkus
[0:45] 25 25.
[0:47] in the old testament it's the book after
[0:50] exodus
[0:52] we're
[0:53] we're still in the message of adoption
[0:56] and this is number 29
[0:58] the word of god reads if thy brother be
[1:02] wax and poor
[1:03] and hath sold away some of his
[1:06] possession and if any of his kin come to
[1:09] redeem it
[1:10] then shall he redeem that
[1:13] which is brother sold
[1:16] amen
[1:17] you may be seated brothers this morning
[1:19] i greet
[1:20] each and every one of you in the name of
[1:22] the lord jesus christ
[1:26] we're going to begin
[1:30] with this message number 29 in the
[1:32] series of adoption
[1:34] i trust that god
[1:36] will help me
[1:38] to get to the part where i desire to uh
[1:42] get to
[1:43] and being that uh we're in the thought
[1:46] that we are gods
[1:49] and a man completely and totally
[1:51] surrendered to god is omnipotent
[1:55] we know that it's the blood of jesus
[1:57] christ that returns us
[2:00] once again to god
[2:02] to make us
[2:03] sons and daughters of god and being in
[2:05] this
[2:09] it falls are locked that part
[2:11] which we are in this morning which is
[2:13] redemption
[2:15] in reality it's been days that i've been
[2:18] meditating this in which i want to get
[2:20] to
[2:22] and i don't know
[2:24] how far i can get to this but i also
[2:27] want to stop and hold back
[2:29] and stop from saying them
[2:31] but just to give you
[2:33] enough
[2:34] so that your mind is opened up and you
[2:36] can be led by god through the word and
[2:39] through the message and may you be able
[2:40] to capture and obtain
[2:43] understand what i'm trying to say
[2:45] without doing it openly or being so
[2:47] obvious i want to say that i'm going to
[2:49] begin to read in the message of the
[2:51] prophet
[2:52] then i'm going to go to the scripture
[2:54] and as i'm reading and speaking i want
[2:57] that you
[2:58] have in your mind that we are gods
[3:02] minor gods that uh
[3:05] what takes us
[3:07] back to our original place is the ransom
[3:11] that jesus christ came to pay for
[3:15] as he died on calvary's cross
[3:18] through the sacrifice that he did
[3:20] shedding his blood
[3:22] therefore
[3:23] that is what makes us apt or eligible to
[3:25] be able to go back and return to that
[3:28] original condition and in that i believe
[3:30] that god has given us a tremendous light
[3:32] through the messenger of this age which
[3:34] is william mary and branham but at the
[3:37] same time
[3:39] there's some things there that uh that
[3:42] many of those that follow
[3:45] this message it's disturbed or disrupted
[3:47] them and being that there has been a
[3:50] disruption
[3:52] it's it's it's it follows my law and
[3:54] it's convenient and as god guides me to
[3:56] it to try to help you a little bit
[3:59] and that is uh
[4:00] on the question
[4:02] in which
[4:04] is
[4:05] always uh
[4:07] asked
[4:08] and the question is has the lord already
[4:11] come
[4:12] has the lord already come has mercy
[4:14] finished is there still mercy and you
[4:17] know there's people that say there's no
[4:18] longer any mercy and as time goes by
[4:20] there's more people that are adding
[4:22] themselves to this group that believes
[4:23] that i believe that in our minds
[4:28] this question might also come are is
[4:30] there still mercy
[4:32] so that if there's this question so much
[4:34] in the minds of the believers there has
[4:36] to be a why i believe the bible the
[4:38] message we have the answer of the why
[4:41] this question keeps coming up
[4:43] do you remember when i repeat when i
[4:45] preached about three or four years ago
[4:47] when mercy has finished we proved it
[4:49] clearly
[4:50] but lately uh that wave still comes and
[4:53] surges and that question surges in the
[4:55] minds of the people is there still mercy
[4:58] and you see that there's more groups and
[5:00] more people are adding themselves to
[5:02] that side that believe that there is no
[5:04] more mercy
[5:06] the other day the brothers from
[5:08] california came out
[5:10] angelo brothers
[5:12] and one from canada and they told me
[5:14] that there was no longer any mercy that
[5:16] if their mercy had finished on the last
[5:18] day of 1977
[5:20] and it didn't please them very well
[5:21] because uh i had to cut them
[5:24] very hard
[5:26] when they come out of the word of god
[5:28] and they can't prove it i can't help
[5:31] but to cut that right there see
[5:33] and on occasions they misunderstand me
[5:36] and uh but i'm it's not my intention to
[5:39] hurt the brother
[5:41] but i do desire to cut
[5:44] any error
[5:46] that surges or comes up against the word
[5:49] i'm going to begin to read in the book
[5:51] of the seals you can write it down and
[5:53] then you can read it later in your home
[5:55] in spanish it's page 70 and in english
[5:58] it's page 87
[6:01] the
[6:02] the word of god reads like this
[6:05] adam could not meet the requirements of
[6:08] redemption
[6:10] after he found
[6:12] he lost it
[6:14] he had sinned and he'd separated himself
[6:17] from god and was on this side of the
[6:19] chasm so he could not redeem it
[6:22] he just couldn't do it
[6:24] because uh he was he needed redemption
[6:27] himself
[6:28] so he could not do it
[6:30] but the law required a kinsmen redeemer
[6:35] the law of god required a kinsmen
[6:38] redeemer if you want to mark that down
[6:40] kinsman redeemer find it leviticus 25.
[6:43] we don't have time thoroughly to search
[6:45] this
[6:45] because you know each text would take a
[6:48] night see
[6:50] but god's law received a substitute now
[6:54] what if god had not offered to take a
[6:57] substitute
[6:59] you see in english it's substitute in
[7:02] other words
[7:03] the bible says that the wages of sin is
[7:06] death
[7:07] so then
[7:08] as there is death each one of us
[7:11] are condemned
[7:14] having sent each one of us were
[7:16] condemned to death and the only reason
[7:19] why we don't die it's because the law of
[7:21] god requires
[7:23] death or
[7:25] a substitute and the law required a
[7:28] substitute and that is our kinsmen
[7:30] redeemer he took our place so that we
[7:34] could take
[7:35] his and have life the bibles and the
[7:38] prophet says
[7:39] but love constrained him to do it
[7:43] that man was without a way back
[7:47] and there's no way for him to get back
[7:49] he was gone
[7:51] but the grace of god
[7:53] met this kinsman redeemer in the person
[7:58] of jesus christ
[7:59] law required it
[8:01] and grace met its requirements
[8:05] oh amazing grace how sweet to sound now
[8:09] notice it says very simple words but the
[8:12] lay required it you see there's no way
[8:14] to escape from this
[8:17] when when you ask for something and you
[8:19] say please that's one thing but when
[8:21] it's demanded you have to meet the
[8:23] requirement the law requires it but the
[8:26] grace
[8:27] is the one that fulfilled the
[8:29] requirement of that
[8:31] demand the law required it but it was
[8:34] grace that met its requirements
[8:37] he continues reading god's law required
[8:39] an innocent substitute and who was
[8:41] innocent every man had been born sexual
[8:43] after sex every one and the only one
[8:45] that wasn't
[8:47] had forfeited the rights to eternal life
[8:52] and to be king
[8:53] on the earth oh when i think of that
[8:56] scripture
[8:57] and then he goes into revelation chapter
[9:00] five but notice
[9:01] there was only one man
[9:03] which
[9:04] had not been born through sex you know
[9:08] any minister that studies the bible
[9:10] knows that this is the truth the only
[9:12] man that had not been born through sex
[9:15] was adam
[9:16] he was created by god
[9:19] but all of these other men were born
[9:21] through
[9:22] sex
[9:23] and a man in that condition
[9:26] could not
[9:28] fulfill the requirements of redemption
[9:31] i want you to notice this is a teaching
[9:33] from the bible and it is also the
[9:36] teaching that william branham brought
[9:38] amen brothers
[9:40] i want that to set down inside your
[9:43] hearts really well therefore the blood
[9:45] or the sacrifice that
[9:47] jesus christ shed
[9:49] was not a blood that was transmitted
[9:53] on behalf of a man who had been born
[9:55] through sex but it was this the very
[9:59] own blood of god that he created which
[10:02] was shed and poured out on calvary
[10:05] because it couldn't have been it could
[10:07] not have been a the blood of a man born
[10:09] through sex which could redeem us it had
[10:12] to be god's very own blood which brought
[10:15] to the earth without sex amen is that
[10:19] correct
[10:20] don't get lost
[10:22] this is easy
[10:24] this is the easy part of the word this
[10:25] morning very well
[10:27] i'm going to read page 83 in spanish and
[10:29] in english it's page 103 of the seals
[10:33] remember if someone has the look um if
[10:36] someone has the book ernie don't leave
[10:39] if someone still has the book there on
[10:40] page 87
[10:42] where we read there it takes you to
[10:44] revelation chapter 5. all right
[10:47] so this is where where i want you to
[10:49] notice
[10:50] therefore
[10:51] i go i pass 13 pages and i begin to read
[10:56] of what he's saying in revelation
[10:58] chapter 5. notice how beautiful
[11:00] the prophet connects this or places it
[11:03] page 83 on the seals in spanish and in
[11:06] english 103 and it brother branham says
[11:09] this and notice
[11:11] he
[11:12] was not an animal
[11:14] he's speaking of the lamb
[11:16] you see because the people think when
[11:18] they hear the lamb they think it's an
[11:20] animal
[11:21] but the prophet clearly tells us here
[11:23] notice he was not an animal
[11:26] because he took the book
[11:28] out of the right hand of him that set
[11:31] upon the throne see
[11:34] let me ask you a question
[11:36] how many of you believe that this lamb
[11:39] is the lord jesus christ
[11:42] how many of you believe
[11:44] that the lamb came and took the book
[11:48] how many of you believe
[11:50] that he did this in the 20th century
[11:54] are you sure brothers very well
[11:57] now
[11:58] so here's where the key is at entering
[12:02] quickly in why the people get confused
[12:05] notice now
[12:06] it's so easy
[12:08] to understand these things look
[12:10] once again and notice
[12:13] he was not a animal
[12:16] because he took the book out of the
[12:18] right hand of him that set upon the
[12:21] throne see
[12:23] who was the original owner that had the
[12:26] book of redemption in his right hand now
[12:29] we already went through that in the last
[12:30] two three messages who had the book
[12:33] in his right hand
[12:34] the prophet says
[12:36] when adam sinned the earth passed
[12:40] to the hands of satan
[12:42] but the title deed
[12:45] to the earth and to eternal life
[12:47] could not go to satan's hands because
[12:49] they were dirty
[12:50] but they returned it went back to its
[12:54] original owner god himself very well now
[12:56] notice and who is god what is god well
[13:01] don't get confused brothers this is
[13:03] where many people
[13:05] uh they don't like us too much
[13:07] and and we've spent so much time through
[13:10] this and let me read open up your bibles
[13:12] to saint john chapter four
[13:15] saint john chapter four let's see what
[13:17] it says there for god is flesh
[13:20] and they that worship him is worship him
[13:23] in flesh and spirit is that right no
[13:26] god is a spirit very well
[13:30] therefore if i understand the word and
[13:33] what the prophet is speaking the title
[13:35] deed return to god
[13:38] the spirit amen brothers
[13:40] because he is the original owner very
[13:43] well i'll continue reading let's see did
[13:45] i already lose you or are you still with
[13:47] me
[13:49] that's why
[13:50] that's where the revelation is at is
[13:52] it's in deity notice now closely i'll
[13:55] continue reading in the seals page 83. i
[13:58] know i'm going to be repeating a lot but
[14:00] but i want you to make sure that you
[14:02] understand this
[14:04] now notice
[14:05] he was not a animal because he took the
[14:08] book out of the right hand of him that
[14:10] set upon the throne see
[14:13] therefore if i understand how can
[14:16] this one come to take the book out of
[14:19] this
[14:20] one
[14:22] that is seated down so there's one
[14:24] that's sitting on the throne and then
[14:26] another person comes and takes the book
[14:30] out of the hand of him
[14:32] which is sitting on the throne
[14:35] are you following me
[14:37] now
[14:38] i'm going to go back who's sitting on
[14:40] the throne can someone answer
[14:42] who's sitting on the throne god who
[14:45] god the spirit
[14:48] no brother no
[14:50] let me go back again
[14:52] and i i i'm barely in the abc's
[14:56] i've i have about 20 messages on this
[14:59] subject of that we are god's brother
[15:00] elgin read saint john 4 24 once again
[15:03] read it from the back there so to see if
[15:05] the people can uh wake up don't reason
[15:09] don't reason believe just what the bible
[15:11] says read it brother king in in a loud
[15:13] voice john 4 24
[15:17] god is a spirit and they that worship
[15:19] him must worship him in spirit and in
[15:21] truth
[15:22] very well
[15:23] therefore god is a spirit the prophet
[15:26] says that the title deed returned
[15:29] to the hands of god almighty
[15:32] please don't tell me that it returned to
[15:35] the hands of jesus christ
[15:37] it returned to the hands of god almighty
[15:40] because god is a spirit very well i'll
[15:44] continue reading i'm going to read once
[15:46] again page 83
[15:47] in english it's page 103 and 102
[15:51] and he says and notice he was not a
[15:54] animal because he took the book out of
[15:57] the right hand of him
[16:00] that set
[16:01] upon the throne you see now brother
[16:04] jimmy who was sitting on the throne
[16:07] god the spirit thank you brother jimmy
[16:10] the prophet says
[16:12] who was the original holder of the book
[16:15] of life
[16:16] who is the original owner that had the
[16:18] book of life in his hand god because god
[16:22] being a spirit he made him in his image
[16:25] and and to that spiritual son is the one
[16:28] that he gave
[16:29] control of all things and he gave him
[16:31] the book or the title deed for that
[16:33] property
[16:34] and when man sinned
[16:37] then the title returned once again back
[16:41] to its original loner
[16:43] we were not the original owners the
[16:45] original owner is god the father the
[16:48] almighty very well
[16:51] and no angel
[16:53] no angelic being
[16:55] nothing else could take the place
[16:57] and this bloody lamb walked out
[17:01] and took the book out of his hand what
[17:03] was it
[17:04] brother this is the most sublime thing
[17:08] in the scripture
[17:11] the act that not an angel
[17:13] not nothing could do it
[17:15] and the lamb come and took it
[17:18] for and took it from the right hand of
[17:20] him
[17:21] that set upon the throne
[17:27] what is it
[17:29] therefore in order to be able to take
[17:30] the books
[17:32] the book i want to stay kind of quiet
[17:34] and slow so that no one can
[17:35] misunderstand this book no one could
[17:38] take it
[17:39] not even
[17:41] brother wesley
[17:42] or brother luther
[17:45] neither could uh
[17:47] any minister could take it
[17:50] no matter how good of a person he was
[17:52] neither could isaiah jeremiah or malachi
[17:56] take it neither we william branham there
[17:59] was no man
[18:00] that could take this book
[18:02] there was only one person
[18:05] who could go
[18:06] to where god was at
[18:09] with the book in his right hand and take
[18:11] the book from the right hand of god
[18:15] and that is the lamb
[18:18] jesus christ
[18:20] who was born without sex to be the
[18:24] substitute now notice
[18:26] now
[18:27] now
[18:28] it belongs to the lamb the book now
[18:30] belongs to the lamb
[18:32] now it belongs to the lamb very well
[18:35] now
[18:36] here he's we're reading in the breach i
[18:38] want you to remember that he's speaking
[18:41] in the breach before he preached the
[18:43] first seal
[18:45] after
[18:46] william branham made contact with the
[18:48] seven angels on mount sunset
[18:52] says it reads now it belongs to the lamb
[18:56] so then this book
[18:59] belongs to the lamb amen he's the one
[19:02] that holds it who has the book who holds
[19:05] the book according to the prophet the
[19:06] lamb amen brothers i'm reading it notice
[19:10] and your reasoning
[19:12] let me go to the message the revelation
[19:14] of jesus christ
[19:17] you see brothers it's it's not difficult
[19:18] brothers to understand the message that
[19:20] the prophet brought us
[19:22] it's difficult to get the people to
[19:24] accept just
[19:26] the way that the prophet brought it in
[19:28] the book
[19:29] uh the revelation of jesus christ word
[19:31] for word by
[19:33] brought by the prophet i'm reading it
[19:35] from the book in english page 347
[19:38] paragraph 93
[19:40] and then i skipped there to page 348
[19:44] and if i get out of the scripture
[19:45] brothers please
[19:46] i want that you
[19:48] when i
[19:49] finish the message in any message that
[19:52] i'm preaching i want you if i get out of
[19:53] the scripture i want you to speak to me
[19:55] because i do not want to be in error do
[19:58] you think i want to be an error because
[20:00] if i
[20:01] fail or make mistakes then i take you to
[20:03] the slaughter but i trust in what
[20:05] william branham is speaking is thus
[20:08] saith the lord
[20:09] therefore he gives me the scripture even
[20:12] though he doesn't quote it but he gives
[20:14] it to me so when he gives it to me but
[20:16] since i more or less know where the
[20:18] scriptures i go search for the scripture
[20:19] and there i dovetail it or
[20:22] tie it in with what he's saying and
[20:24] being that brother branham and the
[20:25] scripture says the same thing then i
[20:27] can't take the interpretation of no one
[20:30] else but i take what's written
[20:33] and what my prophet has spoken in this
[20:34] 20th century
[20:36] now notice
[20:40] this is a paragraph 93 page 347
[20:44] it reads like this
[20:46] now
[20:47] he ascended on high
[20:50] is that right i'm going to give you the
[20:51] scripture
[20:52] brother branham is is quoting here and
[20:54] then there's a period he says he
[20:56] ascended on high the scripture says in
[20:58] ephesians 4 8
[21:00] he ascended on high
[21:02] is that right and he led captivity
[21:05] captive
[21:06] and who
[21:07] now he that ascended what is it but that
[21:10] he also descended first now that he
[21:12] ascended what is it but that he also
[21:15] descended first into the lowest parts of
[21:16] the earth now how many of you want to be
[21:18] sons of god
[21:19] how many of you want to be
[21:21] ascended on high
[21:23] you first have to descend to the lowest
[21:26] parts of the earth
[21:28] he that shall humble himself shall be
[21:29] exalted in his humiliation his judgment
[21:33] was taken away therefore
[21:35] he ascended on high
[21:37] but before he ascended on high he
[21:41] descended to the lowest parts of the
[21:43] earth very well
[21:45] the prophet says
[21:46] and as steven or stephen said i see
[21:49] heavens opened and
[21:51] jesus sitting
[21:53] at the right hand of god
[21:56] what a tremendous thing the prophet says
[21:58] that stephen
[21:59] he saw the heavens opened
[22:01] and he saw that god was there
[22:05] he must have been sitting on his throne
[22:07] and god was sitting on his throne
[22:10] and then he saw that one
[22:13] was at his right hand and the one that
[22:16] he saw was jesus
[22:18] that's what brother branham says now
[22:20] let's see if that's what the bible says
[22:23] before we continue any further
[22:25] in the book of acts
[22:26] chapter 7
[22:28] verse 55
[22:31] book of acts
[22:32] 7
[22:34] verse 55 and 56
[22:37] he's speaking luke is speaking here or
[22:40] writing
[22:41] the events when stephen was preaching
[22:45] he said
[22:46] but he being full of the holy ghost
[22:50] looked up steadfastly into heaven
[22:54] and saw the glory of god and jesus
[22:58] standing on the right hand of god and
[23:01] said
[23:03] behold i see the heavens opened
[23:06] and the son of man standing on the right
[23:10] hand of god
[23:12] where was jesus according to the
[23:14] scriptures when stephen saw him
[23:17] this is now after his resurrection
[23:20] after jesus ascended
[23:23] and then stephen is looking and seeing
[23:25] he says i saw him at the right hand can
[23:28] you say amen brothers no
[23:30] i can see that you say oh brother garcia
[23:33] you're bringing two
[23:35] you know remember god is in morphe he
[23:38] changes his masks
[23:40] do you believe
[23:41] that when moses spoke it was god
[23:44] speaking when isaiah was speaking
[23:47] would it have been god speaking well
[23:49] well well then which one of them is god
[23:51] we already read and told you that god is
[23:53] a spirit i'll continue reading what the
[23:56] prophet says now
[23:57] let's go see what the right hand means
[24:00] the prophet said
[24:01] right hand that does not mean
[24:04] that god has got a great big right hand
[24:08] and him sitting on it
[24:10] but right hand means
[24:13] the right hand of power and authority
[24:16] that's why jesus
[24:19] after he took that perfect sacrifice
[24:21] before god he came back to his disciples
[24:24] and he said
[24:25] all power is given unto me in heaven and
[24:29] in earth
[24:30] and below the earth is that right all
[24:32] power
[24:33] therefore
[24:34] if there was some other one there
[24:37] that thought that he was the one he had
[24:40] to subject himself to jesus now he's
[24:42] saying here so that you can understand
[24:44] this tremendous drama because god is one
[24:48] but he takes different masks to be able
[24:51] to
[24:52] reveal different acts or different
[24:54] things
[24:56] so i'll continue reading
[24:58] that body that god created now i'm going
[25:01] to ask you a question
[25:03] do you believe
[25:04] that
[25:06] the god that said let there be light and
[25:08] there was light
[25:10] who created the heavens and the earth do
[25:13] you believe that that god
[25:15] first of all created for himself a body
[25:18] no it can't be because god
[25:20] he is the one that is the self-existing
[25:24] one
[25:24] therefore when he's speaking
[25:27] about this one about this body that god
[25:29] created it is the body
[25:32] in which god lived here on earth
[25:36] two thousand years ago because the body
[25:38] called jesus is only the tabernacle in
[25:43] which god came to step foot on earth
[25:47] because the bible says what house will
[25:49] you build me
[25:51] there's no place
[25:53] there's no
[25:54] large enough place to keep to sustain
[25:56] god that's why the the bible says where
[25:59] shall i go whether shall i flee if i
[26:01] ascend up into heaven where can i hide
[26:03] where you will not find me if i go up
[26:05] into heaven now right there if i go to
[26:07] the uttermost parts of the sea there you
[26:09] are
[26:10] so you see
[26:11] he occupies all space at all time he's
[26:14] omnipotent he's tremendous he's the
[26:16] self-existing one but when he begins to
[26:19] speak of this body that god created
[26:22] he's speaking of this body called jesus
[26:27] now follow me he reads like this
[26:29] that body that god created then he says
[26:32] then brother brahm says
[26:34] i'll not i will not suffer my holy one
[26:37] to seek corruption
[26:40] neither will i leave his soul in hell
[26:44] because his soul went to hell amen
[26:47] brothers
[26:48] but his body he says he says i'll not
[26:50] allow his body to see corruption neither
[26:52] will i leave
[26:53] his soul in hell but raised him up and
[26:56] set him in the stead of the spirit on
[26:59] the altar but raised him up and set him
[27:03] in the stead of the spirit on the altar
[27:05] watch when they see him sitting on the
[27:07] altar and had the book in his hand and
[27:10] no man on earth
[27:12] or beneath the earth or anywhere
[27:16] was able or worthy to even look at the
[27:20] book but a lamb
[27:22] that as it had been slain from the
[27:24] foundation of the world way back at the
[27:27] beginning
[27:30] when he first thought
[27:33] of this redeemed body
[27:35] come and took it
[27:38] out of the right hand of him
[27:40] that sets upon the throne
[27:43] and set down himself amen there you are
[27:47] that's the scriptures
[27:49] it's just
[27:50] beautiful
[27:52] i'm going to bring it down to uh just an
[27:54] easier speech what the prophet is saying
[27:56] here is that here's god sitting on his
[27:58] throne
[28:00] but then the time comes
[28:02] in which the lamb
[28:04] being that he was the one who paid the
[28:06] price you see
[28:08] because when you buy something
[28:11] the guy who pays for it claims it so
[28:14] then the time came when the lamb went to
[28:16] the spirit that was sitting on the
[28:18] throne and he takes the book
[28:20] and then
[28:22] brother brahm says he the lamb himself
[28:24] sits down on the throne
[28:27] so the time comes when the lamb
[28:30] is
[28:32] will sit it sat on his throne and i'm
[28:36] not i don't want to go into that subject
[28:37] of the throne but i i'm going to give
[28:39] you a key first of all brother braham
[28:41] says the first throne was in heaven the
[28:43] second throne was in jesus christ and
[28:45] the third
[28:47] place that the throne is at is in man
[28:51] so then therefore the time comes when
[28:53] the lamb
[28:56] unveils the the role of of a kinsmen
[28:59] redeemer he goes to him who's sitting on
[29:02] the throne and he takes the book
[29:05] and when he takes the book
[29:06] he himself sits down
[29:09] he sits down from where he's going to
[29:12] govern where he's going to reign that's
[29:15] the reason why the bible says
[29:18] above all things keep thy heart keep thy
[29:21] heart with all diligence for out of it
[29:23] out of the heart are the issues of life
[29:26] because that's where
[29:28] the lamb comes to
[29:30] sit he sits in the throne he sits down
[29:33] in the heart of man the throne of god
[29:36] and from there eternal life flows let me
[29:38] go to the scripture revelation chapter
[29:40] five are you still following me brothers
[29:42] the prophet says the prophet says
[29:44] he says it makes me remember this and
[29:46] then he begins to read in revelation but
[29:49] i'm going to read uh from verse one
[29:52] and i saw on the right hand of him that
[29:54] sat on the throne
[29:57] a book written
[29:59] within
[30:00] and
[30:01] on the backside sealed with seven seals
[30:04] and i saw a strong angel proclaiming
[30:06] with a loud voice who is worthy to open
[30:08] the book
[30:10] and to loose the seals thereof
[30:13] and no man in heaven
[30:14] nor in earth neither under the earth was
[30:17] able to open the book
[30:19] neither to look thereon
[30:22] and i went much because no man was found
[30:25] worthy to open
[30:27] and to read the book
[30:29] neither to look thereon
[30:32] and one of the elders saith unto me
[30:35] weep not
[30:36] behold the lion of the tribe of judah
[30:39] the root of david
[30:41] hath prevailed to open the book
[30:45] and to loose the seven seals thereof and
[30:48] i beheld and lo
[30:50] in the midst of the throne
[30:52] and of the four beasts
[30:54] and in the midst of the elders
[30:56] stood a lamb
[30:59] as it had been slain
[31:01] having seven horns and seven eyes which
[31:06] are the seven spirits of god
[31:09] sent forth into
[31:11] all the earth now notice
[31:14] the bible says that this lamb had
[31:17] seven horns
[31:19] is that right brothers
[31:22] he also had seven eyes seven eyes and
[31:25] the seven eyes are the seven spirits of
[31:28] god is that right
[31:30] seven spirits of god very well
[31:32] therefore
[31:34] what did the prophet say
[31:35] that this
[31:36] the seven
[31:38] horns were he said that they were the
[31:39] seven church ages is that right
[31:41] he said that the seven spirits are
[31:44] the seven messengers is that right
[31:46] brothers now notice
[31:49] therefore this lamb has
[31:52] seven horns seven eyes and seven spirits
[31:55] now remember when i began to read i said
[31:58] that the prophet said this is not a
[32:00] animal but he's saying this he's saying
[32:03] this so the people can understand so i
[32:05] want to say that that lamb
[32:08] was going to be there
[32:11] and this great
[32:12] this great scene of revelation chapter 5
[32:16] could not be fulfilled until
[32:19] this end time
[32:21] in this 20th century
[32:24] now notice this cloud this cloud that
[32:26] came down in mount sunset what is it
[32:28] that you see
[32:31] you see seven angels is that right and
[32:34] these seven angels form this cloud and
[32:37] there
[32:39] there's only one eye is that right
[32:41] brothers well we've gone through that
[32:43] already the ones that don't understand
[32:44] me well go back and begin with adoption
[32:46] from number one and on
[32:49] brother sam thinks that he knows it
[32:50] right but uh well let brother sammy go
[32:53] and hear that again or some other you
[32:54] haven't heard me brothers now notice
[32:57] this same cloud
[32:59] is the only stone it's this same cloud
[33:03] is the cloud that led the people of
[33:05] israel through the desert this same
[33:08] cloud is the same cloud that is called
[33:10] the logos that came out of god but this
[33:14] same cloud
[33:16] became man
[33:18] and that is what we call or name jesus
[33:20] christ in the beginning way back in the
[33:23] beginning he was the word
[33:24] and the word was god and the word was
[33:26] with god and
[33:28] this word was made flesh and dwelt among
[33:31] us and being found in the fashion is a
[33:34] flesh man he humbled himself
[33:37] he used all power he humbled himself
[33:40] he humbled himself and became obedient
[33:43] unto death even the death of the cross
[33:45] wherefore god also has exalted him and
[33:48] given him a name which is above every
[33:50] name
[33:51] so then don't get shook up when i when i
[33:53] tell you these things just so that you
[33:54] can begin to understand me
[33:57] here's the seven corns the seven eyes
[33:59] and the seven spirits therefore for you
[34:01] to understand it you know what this is
[34:03] this is the right hand of god oh brother
[34:06] brother garcia you missed it no sir
[34:09] read the bible where it says where jesus
[34:11] says speaking about his uh
[34:14] sevenfold glory of his person
[34:17] eyes was a flame of fire feet like unto
[34:21] fine brass out of his mouth went a sharp
[34:23] two-edged sword hair's as white as wool
[34:26] and the bible says and in his right hand
[34:29] he had seven stars
[34:32] and the bible says according to 120 or
[34:36] 21 of revelation
[34:38] that the seven stars are the seventh
[34:39] angels are the seven angels so here
[34:41] comes his right hand which means
[34:43] authority that is why the reason
[34:47] that when the cloud would settle down
[34:50] the people of israel would stop and camp
[34:52] there and the cloud would stay there a
[34:54] month a week without moving
[34:57] and there the people of israel camped
[35:00] because the authority
[35:04] so that they could move
[35:06] was the supreme authority
[35:09] which is god himself therefore we see
[35:13] that the authority comes down
[35:16] the right hand comes down verse 6
[35:19] and i beheld a low in the midst of the
[35:21] throne
[35:22] and of the four beasts and in the midst
[35:25] of the elders stood a lamb
[35:28] as it had been slain having seven horns
[35:32] and seven eyes the seven horns belonged
[35:35] to the lamb
[35:36] and this one had seven eyes now if these
[35:39] are my eyes don't take my eyes out
[35:41] please they're my eyes
[35:43] so these seven eyes are the eyes of the
[35:46] lamb
[35:47] and these seven eyes are the seven
[35:49] spirits of god sent forth into all the
[35:52] earth
[35:53] and this slam came
[35:55] and took the book
[35:57] out of the right hand of him
[35:59] that sat
[36:01] upon
[36:02] the throne
[36:04] therefore if he came and took the book
[36:07] it means that the lamb was not sitting
[36:09] on the throne
[36:10] that's the reason why people
[36:12] for 2000 years has mock have mocked
[36:16] the christians and they've martyred them
[36:19] they've killed them they're skeptics
[36:20] that say how could it how could god a
[36:23] wise and all-knowing and such a good god
[36:25] stay with his arms crossed
[36:27] while they slaughtered millions of
[36:29] christians that according to the
[36:31] catholic church
[36:33] millions of christians were killed
[36:36] they killed them themselves how can this
[36:37] be
[36:38] it's because
[36:40] he had not taken his throne the lamb had
[36:43] yet not taken his throne but he had to
[36:46] be there until the last elected one
[36:49] would suffer
[36:50] would take his cup come to the earth be
[36:53] manifested and be tested to the utmost
[36:57] but let me tell you that when the last
[37:00] son of god comes into perfection
[37:05] it will no longer be a lamb
[37:08] but it will be the same god executing
[37:11] judgment as a lion sitting on his throne
[37:14] let me go back to the seals brothers i
[37:16] already read the scripture right i have
[37:18] about 10 more minutes and i'll see if i
[37:20] can finish in in spanish 83 brothers
[37:24] in english i believe it's 103. he says
[37:26] this notice
[37:28] he he is not an animal he took the book
[37:30] out of the right hand of him to set upon
[37:32] the throne who was this the owner the
[37:33] original owner that had the book of
[37:35] redemption in his right hand and no
[37:37] angel no angelic bee nothing else could
[37:39] take the place and this bloody lamb
[37:40] walked out and took the book out of his
[37:42] hand what was it brother this is the
[37:44] most sublime thing in the scripture
[37:46] an act
[37:48] not an angel not nothing could do it
[37:51] i've come to claim the rights the he had
[37:54] they had a right to everything that had
[37:57] had been lost in the fall and i've paid
[37:59] the price oh brother woof don't it make
[38:01] you feel religious
[38:03] not by works which we have done
[38:06] but by his mercy oh wait a minute now
[38:08] all them elders and everything else
[38:10] begin to throw off crowns and
[38:12] dignitaries begin to get on the ground
[38:16] no one no one could do it
[38:19] and he the lamb walks right up to the
[38:22] right hand of god
[38:24] and took the book out of his hand and
[38:27] claimed his rights saying i have died
[38:30] for them i am their kinsmen redeemer i
[38:33] am the mediator my blood was shed
[38:36] i have become man and i did this in
[38:40] order to get that church back again
[38:44] the one i foresaw before the foundation
[38:46] of the world
[38:47] i have purposed it i spoke that it would
[38:50] be there
[38:52] and nobody was able to take it
[38:55] but i went down and done it myself i am
[38:59] their kinsmen
[39:01] i become kin folks and he takes the book
[39:04] amen brothers is that right brother do
[39:06] you believe he took the book are you
[39:08] sure
[39:09] very well
[39:10] let's read now the last page
[39:12] page in spanish it's 90 and 91 and in
[39:15] english it's page 111.
[39:17] he says this he says this
[39:20] talk about a jubilee
[39:22] talk about a time when that lamb walked
[39:25] forth
[39:27] you see brother
[39:30] brother tommy
[39:31] why it is that people think that there's
[39:33] no longer any mercy because the prophet
[39:35] said that the lamb came out you see
[39:37] brother david
[39:39] but now you know how the thing is here's
[39:42] where that transaction the change
[39:46] precise change
[39:48] begins to happen
[39:49] that change that we've spoken on many
[39:51] occasions now how many of you believe
[39:52] that jesus christ is god is that right
[39:54] brothers
[39:55] he's god
[39:57] but the answer has to be in the bible
[39:59] and when they slew him
[40:02] why did they slay him because being a
[40:04] man
[40:06] was he a man
[40:07] yes he was a man i don't i don't
[40:11] understand brother bernie was he a man
[40:12] or was he god it was god but he took
[40:17] a form of humanity or a body like unto
[40:21] us to be able to redeem us brother
[40:23] branham says talk about a jubilee talk
[40:25] about a time when that lamb walked forth
[40:28] see it's this is the time when the
[40:30] transaction is taking place
[40:32] because he died as a man
[40:35] but he was the but he was the very own
[40:38] blood that he had created which was the
[40:39] blood of god now notice when he was born
[40:42] king herod said let's see uh tell me uh
[40:44] where was he been born so that i can go
[40:46] worship him
[40:48] but he wasn't thinking about worshiping
[40:49] he was thinking about going to kill him
[40:51] herod wanted to kill jesus but he
[40:54] couldn't kill him because
[40:56] it was written that he had to be that
[40:59] perfect lamb therefore when he was born
[41:01] the bible says for unto us a child is
[41:03] born is that right
[41:05] is it a child that's been born
[41:07] then this child was born and it was
[41:09] given unto us a son unto us a son is
[41:12] given so that the son could pay the
[41:14] price
[41:16] but that same son
[41:17] is the eternal father therefore the time
[41:20] comes where he begins to change
[41:23] from son
[41:25] to the eternal father
[41:28] and when the time comes where the last
[41:31] son of god that was rescued by the sun
[41:34] that's here on earth he raises up
[41:37] and he goes to take the book
[41:39] that's the reason why
[41:41] the the shout comes the the shout that
[41:44] says awaken because the lamb is coming
[41:47] to take away his subjects the day of
[41:50] redemption
[41:53] is at hand which is the resurrection of
[41:55] the dead how tremendous i notice
[41:57] he says the lamb came
[42:00] you see the book
[42:03] even in heaven is sealed it says of the
[42:06] mysteries but no
[42:07] no it's not in english
[42:10] spanish is the book of mysteries but
[42:11] it's not in english i can't read it see
[42:13] see the books even sealed in heaven
[42:17] you say
[42:19] is my name there i don't know i hope it
[42:21] is
[42:22] but if it is it was put on the book
[42:25] before
[42:28] the foundation of the world
[42:30] but the first thing that represented
[42:32] that redemption
[42:34] the first thing that represented that
[42:36] redemption
[42:38] come
[42:38] was the lamb
[42:40] that had been slain
[42:42] from the foundation of the world
[42:44] and he took the book glory
[42:48] do you believe that the glam took the
[42:49] book brothers he opened the book tore
[42:52] off the seals
[42:53] and if there's someone here who doesn't
[42:55] understand this
[42:56] we have the book of seals preached by
[42:58] william branham
[42:59] and he tore off the seals and sent it
[43:01] down the book he sent down the book to
[43:04] the earth
[43:05] to his seventh angel
[43:07] to reveal it to his people there you are
[43:10] so then who did he give the book to
[43:13] he gave it to the seventh angel and now
[43:15] don't get shook up
[43:16] because i already read the scripture
[43:18] where he says that jesus was sitting at
[43:21] the right hand of god
[43:23] but then jesus also promises that unto
[43:26] him who overcometh will i grant to sit
[43:27] with me in my throne
[43:30] even
[43:31] on my throne
[43:33] even as i also overcame and have sat
[43:36] down with my father in his throne that's
[43:38] the reason why he sat william branham in
[43:41] the midst of this pillar of cloud
[43:44] where
[43:45] the right hand is at where the right
[43:47] hand is at where the authority is at
[43:49] where the third pool is at where the
[43:51] creative word is at that is where the
[43:54] power is at so that
[43:57] the manifestation of the sons of god can
[43:59] come which is a total adoption
[44:03] god
[44:04] in simplicity
[44:05] revealing himself to his people let us
[44:08] pray oh father thank you lord
[44:12] lord
[44:13] that adam
[44:15] he was so perfect lord but he forfeited
[44:18] he sold everything and when he sold it
[44:21] perhaps
[44:22] michael or gabriel wanted to descend but
[44:25] you didn't allow it
[44:27] you said i myself will descend
[44:30] i can't trust this to anyone else
[44:34] you came to man and you began to
[44:36] interrogate him
[44:37] but two thousand years ago
[44:40] your word was fulfilled
[44:42] the one that says
[44:44] behold a virgin shall conceive and shall
[44:46] give birth to a son
[44:48] your word fat sat
[44:51] your
[44:52] your word
[44:54] fitted perfectly in the womb of mary
[44:57] the virgin and your spirit overshadowed
[45:00] over that word so that that word
[45:02] could become that which human hands
[45:05] could not touch and out of that was born
[45:08] the only begotten son of god lord you
[45:10] took the burden upon your shoulders all
[45:13] of our sins
[45:14] by your stripes we have been healed you
[45:17] died lord
[45:19] even the earth shook
[45:21] heavens began to weep
[45:24] darkness upon all nature
[45:27] and the people said
[45:29] truly this is the son of god
[45:33] you were buried your body
[45:36] was there protected
[45:39] by that squadron of soldiers but you
[45:43] could not be held back by those prisons
[45:45] lord
[45:46] there you were in the lowest parts of
[45:49] the earth still preaching
[45:52] this eternal gospel
[45:55] lord you ascended to the parrot to
[45:58] paradise you threw open the doors to
[46:01] those that were waiting on the sacrifice
[46:03] on that perfect sacrifice you
[46:05] resurrected you presented yourself to
[46:08] your disciples you ascended up into
[46:09] glory and you sent back your holy spirit
[46:12] lord to dwell
[46:14] in us
[46:15] through the last 2 000 years and in this
[46:17] 20th century
[46:19] when the cup of iniquity of the amorites
[46:23] had is full lord
[46:26] they're mocking us
[46:27] that
[46:28] church drunk
[46:30] with the
[46:32] wine with the revelation of the blood of
[46:34] the saints that have been martyred
[46:37] and you
[46:38] as the righteous judge with your wig
[46:42] ready to judge humanity
[46:44] but then
[46:45] in that same scene
[46:47] being that there was no one there to
[46:49] take the book to open it or to reveal
[46:51] the secret so that your people could get
[46:54] ready you yourself presented yourself
[46:57] and you said i have died for them i have
[47:00] paid the price
[47:01] you then took the book lord
[47:04] and you gave it to the seventh angel
[47:07] and here i have in front of me this
[47:10] revelation lord i can't help it
[47:13] but to
[47:15] cry out oh redeeming grace lord
[47:19] it's not that we worshipped a man
[47:21] but we worship you for your greatness
[47:24] because this was already written and it
[47:27] had to be fulfilled there could there
[47:29] was no one that could hold this back
[47:31] because your word never fails you're
[47:34] perfect you're infinite you're
[47:35] infallible lord
[47:38] help us
[47:40] to stand on that solid rock
[47:43] that immovable rock if there's someone
[47:45] that doesn't know you in the power of
[47:46] your resurrection
[47:48] may they be able to know you lord extend
[47:51] your hand to them before it's too late
[47:54] in the name of the lord jesus christ
[47:57] amen
[48:06] many people do you think understood that
