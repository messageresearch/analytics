[18:16] once again it's an honor to be here
[18:18] tonight
[18:19] to share
[18:21] a glimpse of our prophet's life william
[18:24] mary and branham
[18:26] taken from the book supernatural the
[18:27] life of william branham this is coming
[18:30] from chapter 10 and book one
[18:33] uh the boy and his deprivation
[18:40] something i would like to share in
[18:42] advance of the reading of this excerpt
[18:45] there are moments in everyone's life
[18:47] including the life of our prophet
[18:49] where his faith is being shaped and
[18:52] formed
[18:53] i feel very strongly that this was
[18:55] certainly touching on more than one of
[18:57] those
[18:58] it has something in it for both the
[19:00] young and old our young people
[19:02] and our adults and our young at heart
[19:06] i ask each one of you to pay close
[19:07] attention to those moments
[19:10] and as i'm reading this also for the
[19:11] very young people
[19:14] there are many times the devil will come
[19:16] at you
[19:17] with a trap
[19:19] and try to ensnare you
[19:22] asking you to prove things that have
[19:24] already been done by our lord jesus
[19:26] christ
[19:28] he's already done the work
[19:31] in this particular excerpt pay very
[19:33] close attention
[19:36] keep your faith strong
[19:38] believe on him
[19:41] and everything will be fine
[19:48] at the time at the beginning of this
[19:50] excerpt
[19:51] brother brannon to set the scene
[19:53] had just met
[19:55] hope brumbach
[19:57] he had just started attending the
[19:59] missionary baptist church
[20:01] and had developed a relationship with
[20:03] its pastor dr roy davis a christian
[20:06] relationship
[20:08] it starts off
[20:10] billy admitted that the reason he chose
[20:12] the missionary baptist church over any
[20:14] other church in town was simply because
[20:17] hope brumback went there
[20:19] however
[20:20] he soon developed a deep respect for its
[20:22] pastor
[20:23] dr roy davis preached that god was no
[20:26] better than his word and that a
[20:28] christian was no better than the faith
[20:30] in the word of god
[20:31] a saying which struck billy as the
[20:33] absolute truth
[20:35] dr davis constantly exhorted his
[20:37] congregation
[20:38] to believe the word of god with all
[20:40] their hearts
[20:41] and to put that word into practice in
[20:44] their daily lives
[20:45] what is more
[20:47] the this pastor seemed to live what he
[20:50] preached
[20:52] one morning in church dr davis told a
[20:54] story of how when he was a young man
[20:56] there had been a certain infidel
[20:59] crisscrossing the land
[21:00] standing up in church after church and
[21:02] challenging the christian faith to a
[21:04] severe test
[21:07] dr davis heard him at a large meeting in
[21:09] memphis tennessee
[21:12] the man read from mark chapter 16 where
[21:14] jesus said
[21:16] and these signs shall follow them that
[21:19] believe
[21:20] in my name they will cast out devils
[21:23] they shall speak with new tongues
[21:25] they shall take up serpents
[21:27] and if they drink any deadly thing it
[21:30] shall not hurt them
[21:32] they shall lay hands on the sick and
[21:34] they shall recover
[21:38] then the infidel set a bottle of
[21:40] sulfuric acid on the podium and
[21:42] challenge the audience
[21:44] any of you people here who are supposed
[21:46] to be christians jesus said if you
[21:48] believe you could drink any deadly thing
[21:51] it would not harm you
[21:54] now if that's the inspired word of god
[21:56] then drink this sulfuric acid
[21:59] he repeated his challenge several times
[22:02] criticizing the christians for their
[22:03] lack of faith and mocking the very idea
[22:05] of god
[22:07] young dr davis said to an old methodist
[22:09] bishop sitting next to him if that
[22:12] infidel makes that challenge one more
[22:14] time
[22:15] i'm going to go up there and drink it
[22:18] the bishop tried to dissuade him
[22:20] the man's just popping his own brain let
[22:23] him alone son the bible says thou shalt
[22:25] not tempt the lord thy god
[22:28] but davis was determined
[22:30] no i won't let him alone and if i die in
[22:33] my shoes i'll go to heaven believing
[22:35] god's word
[22:37] the infidel laughed at the christians
[22:39] as the christians squirmed in their
[22:41] seats
[22:42] what about some of you guys out there
[22:44] that believe god is so real try this
[22:46] sulfuric acid test
[22:49] dr davis strode up to the podium turned
[22:52] and spoke to the audience of around 3
[22:54] 000 people
[22:56] i'm 25 years old i'm a minister of the
[22:59] gospel
[23:00] i know that my god is able to deliver me
[23:03] from that sulfuric acid but nevertheless
[23:06] if he does not i'll never let this
[23:08] infidel stand here in china's god word
[23:11] like this
[23:12] he grabbed the sulfuric acid and drank
[23:14] the bottle empty without suffering so
[23:16] much as a twinge of ill effect
[23:20] then he preached the gospel with such
[23:22] conviction
[23:23] that 1500 people rededicated their lives
[23:26] to jesus christ
[23:28] as billy listened to this story
[23:30] he thought that the methodist bishop had
[23:32] shown more sense than young dr
[23:34] davis why should anyone have to prove
[23:37] god
[23:38] hadn't jesus said about those
[23:40] unbelieving pharisees
[23:42] let them alone if the blind lead the
[23:44] blind they'll both fall in a ditch
[23:47] but even though billy didn't agree with
[23:49] what dr davis had done he still admired
[23:51] his pastor's faith
[23:54] being exposed to a man of such deep
[23:57] conviction inspired billy to pay close
[23:59] attention to the word of god
[24:02] the first chorus billy learned in church
[24:04] went
[24:06] to be like jesus to be like jesus on
[24:09] earth i long to be like him
[24:12] all through life's journey from earth to
[24:14] glory i only ask to be like him
[24:19] that became the constant prayer in
[24:21] billy's heart
[24:23] jesus
[24:24] helped me to be like you
[24:26] after reading through the new testament
[24:28] for the second time
[24:29] billy realized he needed to be baptized
[24:33] he read in matthew 28 where jesus told
[24:36] peter and the other disciples to
[24:38] teach all nations baptizing them in the
[24:41] name of the father and of the son and of
[24:43] the holy ghost
[24:45] then
[24:46] brother brennan read in acts chapter 2
[24:49] where several weeks later peter
[24:50] commanded the people to be baptized
[24:53] every one of you in the name
[24:55] of jesus christ
[24:57] it seemed to bill that if anyone knew
[24:59] what jesus meant when he gave his great
[25:02] commission
[25:03] it must have been peter and the rest of
[25:05] the disciples
[25:07] so billy asked dr davis to baptize him
[25:10] in the same way the apostles baptized in
[25:12] the book of acts
[25:14] even though this ran contrary to the
[25:17] doctrine of the missionary baptist
[25:18] church dr davis obliged and billy was
[25:22] baptized in the name of the lord jesus
[25:25] christ
[25:27] god bless
[25:39] hey man good evening

[39:04] branham talked to us about
[39:06] that it's not this is not fairy tales
[39:09] this is we're not talking about fairy
[39:10] tales though it sounds like it lord
[39:13] to the
[39:16] reason to the rational worldly mind it
[39:18] sounds like fairy tales lord but this is
[39:20] not these are not fairy tales these are
[39:23] real
[39:24] things that happen in history they've
[39:25] been documented
[39:27] that are being taken away from us little
[39:29] by little lord
[39:31] and a lot of things are being taken away
[39:34] from us a lot faster but some of these
[39:36] things are just being taken away from us
[39:37] little by little and
[39:40] as long as we can present to you
[39:42] your children lord the truth and then
[39:44] let them research it on their own that's
[39:46] that's all i'm trying to do lord in the
[39:49] name of lord jesus christ i pray amen
[39:53] as i said in my prayers some of these
[39:55] things are going away
[39:56] some of things are being taken away from
[39:58] us
[39:59] this one here this part that i'm going
[40:00] to be speaking about tonight it was
[40:02] taken away from us
[40:04] 80
[40:05] years ago since 1934 if i do my math
[40:08] correctly it's about 80 years ago
[40:11] so let's read the scripture
[40:13] you shall not be afraid for the terror
[40:16] by night nor for the arrow arrow that
[40:19] flies by day
[40:20] nor for the pestilence that walks in
[40:23] darkness nor for the destruction that
[40:25] wastes at noon day
[40:28] a thousand shall fall at your side and
[40:30] ten thousand at your right hand but it
[40:33] shall not come near you thank you you
[40:35] may be seated
[40:39] now
[40:39] our prophet tells us the following in
[40:41] the and uh he says we had godly men like
[40:44] washington
[40:46] lincoln they had great godly men
[40:48] comparing to israel as david and sulfur
[40:51] then they got an ahab on the throne with
[40:53] a jezebel behind him to direct him so
[40:57] have we that's when i talked to the
[40:59] adults and understand that you guys are
[41:00] getting the little
[41:01] children's version
[41:03] of the adult version that i'll be
[41:05] speaking to the adults about and that's
[41:06] called jezebel religion and the first
[41:09] couple of times i'm going to be talking
[41:10] about just washington and then abraham
[41:13] lincoln if the lord gives me time to do
[41:15] so
[41:16] and i've been getting ready
[41:19] since since since last year um
[41:21] when i had my operation i've been doing
[41:23] some studying on different topics and
[41:25] just getting ready for when the lord
[41:29] provides a time
[41:30] and then this is a note for for you
[41:33] parents this is directly to the people
[41:35] are in the back rosa okay
[41:38] um
[41:39] many scholars the children may not
[41:41] understand that but you can explain to
[41:43] them scholars just means people that
[41:44] study a lot okay many scholars are
[41:47] re-evaluating and really rewriting it
[41:50] how many have heard that before from me
[41:52] say that
[41:53] you know they're rewriting our history
[41:55] books
[41:56] and
[41:57] and are asking very in-depth questions
[41:59] such as was george washington a
[42:01] christian or a deist this just means
[42:03] that you know like god makes a watch
[42:06] very detailed very makes all the
[42:08] universe he puts it there just walks
[42:10] away and forgets about it you know let
[42:12] the loss take care of itself he's doing
[42:14] enough something other stuff you know
[42:15] that's also disbelief kind of sort of
[42:18] very simplistic
[42:19] but
[42:20] your children in school are being asked
[42:23] these
[42:24] moronic
[42:25] questions
[42:26] that's the nicest thing i can see from
[42:28] the platform
[42:30] they're stupid
[42:32] idiotic questions
[42:34] and i'm not bashing
[42:36] the educational system sister it's that
[42:39] somebody's in charge of the educational
[42:40] system
[42:42] they're being told what to teach
[42:44] um and so
[42:46] so so these are some of the things that
[42:48] that are that are um
[42:50] but according to but according to the
[42:52] prophet of god who was george washington
[42:55] and what was he okay
[42:57] raise your hand children you have you
[42:59] have never heard of george washington
[43:00] you never heard you never heard george
[43:02] washington can you raise your hand he
[43:02] never heard our president in washington
[43:04] see we've all we've all heard about him
[43:06] right he's seen our dollar bill is that
[43:08] is he in our dollar bill
[43:10] i don't have a wall anyway
[43:12] my wallet's over here but it's
[43:14] it has different kinds of green paper in
[43:16] it
[43:18] uh here's what brother bam says about
[43:20] george washington he says george
[43:21] washington here at valley that's that's
[43:23] that's him right there
[43:25] crossing the delaware let's see if i get
[43:27] the right
[43:30] i'm going backwards huh
[43:41] okay here we go george washington here
[43:42] at valley forge before he crossed the
[43:44] delaware praying all night imagine that
[43:47] praying all night he was wet wet plain
[43:49] plump to his waist kneeling in snow
[43:53] so he's kneeling in snow and he's
[43:56] um i'm gonna get if i go down i mean i
[43:58] have to get up brother you might have to
[43:59] help me i'm okay
[44:01] he's kneeling in snow and he's wet all
[44:03] the way up to his waist
[44:06] i just was in chicago last january i got
[44:08] my feet wet just a little bit and i got
[44:11] a really bad cold is that right nana
[44:13] i got a really bad cold kind of like a
[44:15] boy kind of sort of but this guy
[44:17] was
[44:18] he's praying
[44:20] wow
[44:21] wet plumped his waist kneeling and so
[44:22] and the next morning when the americans
[44:24] started across there's only about 20
[44:26] percent of them had shoes to wear
[44:29] the american army but they had a
[44:31] principle
[44:33] yeah there we go they had something that
[44:36] they had to fight for they didn't care
[44:38] what come or when the farmers come and
[44:40] stop this plow and took out his ox got
[44:43] his rifle and went out to fight for what
[44:46] he know it was freedom this is what the
[44:47] this is children what they call the men
[44:49] and men they got to be have to be ready
[44:50] in a minute
[44:52] right that's why they call them a minute
[44:53] men and men
[44:54] paul river comes hey the british are
[44:56] coming the red coats are coming
[44:57] they have to right there there's the
[44:59] alarm he sounded the alarm from every
[45:01] middlesex farm and listen to my children
[45:04] you shall hear the midnight ride of paul

[45:07] put so in the morning in april 75 hardly
[45:09] a man is not alive is that right sister
[45:10] is that wiggles
[45:12] i can remember that day or year
[45:14] he said to his friend in the british
[45:15] march
[45:17] they used to have to make they used to
[45:18] make us memorize things we don't do that
[45:20] in school anymore with our children not
[45:22] that much except for multiplication
[45:24] tables
[45:26] but that's a good poem for you guys to
[45:28] learn
[45:33] and uh the farmers come and stop this
[45:34] plow and they fight for what they knew
[45:35] was freedom and the next day i believe
[45:37] it was four or five bullet holes musket
[45:39] bullets went through his coat
[45:42] and had and never touched him
[45:45] okay so that's what brother branham says
[45:47] so we're going to get into
[45:49] somebody say oh that's a bunch of that's
[45:51] just a legend that's just fairy tales no
[45:53] it's it's it's history okay
[45:56] one of the things that was told
[45:58] to uh
[46:02] i don't know i'm not sure which way it
[46:03] is
[46:04] okay
[46:05] got the shortened version here
[46:08] what one of his uh daughters instead is
[46:11] it's like well there's a diff unusual
[46:14] relationship there but
[46:16] uh i'll just read it like this this year
[46:17] his step granddaughter also put in
[46:19] quotation marks
[46:21] um
[46:21] said this about him george washington
[46:24] his life his writings proved that he was
[46:26] a christian
[46:28] people that knew him knew he was the
[46:29] christian he didn't go around bragging
[46:31] about it okay
[46:33] that's what historians say
[46:34] he never talked about jesus you know
[46:37] well
[46:38] he lived it you know talk about it
[46:41] he was not one of those who act or pray
[46:43] that they may be seen a man he communed
[46:45] with with his god in secret many times
[46:49] people would say can i see that can i go
[46:51] can i see the general can i see mr
[46:53] washington and they come in and see
[46:55] washington they kind of pick in this
[46:56] door and be kneeling down praying and so

[47:29] story of god's divine protection and of
[47:32] washington's open gratitude could be
[47:36] found in virtually all school textbooks
[47:39] until 1934.
[47:43] washington
[47:44] okay now few americans have read it
[47:49] washington often recall this dramatic
[47:51] event that helped shape his character
[47:54] and confirm god's call on his life
[47:57] okay
[47:58] now here's here's what they're talking
[48:00] about
[48:01] read this with me kids conflict the

[48:08] uh danny k uh stories right
[48:13] here to know the right saying
[48:14] but here it happened on july 9th it's
[48:17] important to get to know what has

[1:03:29] a people yet unborn will hail him as a
[1:03:32] founder of a mighty empire i am come to
[1:03:34] pay homage to the man who is the
[1:03:37] particular favorite of heaven and who
[1:03:39] can never
[1:03:40] die in
[1:03:42] battle more divine protection this is
[1:03:45] from the book
[1:03:46] he was not he was not even wounded in
[1:03:49] that and that or any of the numerous
[1:03:51] battles in which he fought
[1:03:53] british major patrick ferguson was a
[1:03:56] renowned rifle shot and head of british
[1:03:58] sharpshooters we call them snipers you
[1:04:01] understand young man you understand
[1:04:03] sharpshooters
[1:04:05] snipers you know what a sniper is right
[1:04:10] move
[1:04:11] his men around in the forest as
[1:04:13] professional snipers on one occasion he
[1:04:16] identified an american target and and he
[1:04:19] and three of his best
[1:04:21] sharpshooters drew down on him
[1:04:23] just before ferguson ordered them to
[1:04:26] fire he experienced a surprising
[1:04:29] impulse and declared that the idea of
[1:04:31] shooting that particular american
[1:04:32] suddenly disgusted him
[1:04:36] the american officer in point-blank
[1:04:39] range range
[1:04:43] right it was right there
[1:04:45] they were hiding and they were they
[1:04:46] we got who got you buddy
[1:04:53] and
[1:04:55] point blank range turned and looked
[1:04:57] directly at ferguson locking eyes with
[1:04:58] him over the sides the officer
[1:05:01] slowly turned his back to ferguson okay
[1:05:04] okay well i won't yeah i'll just read it
[1:05:07] to you he looked directly at the guy
[1:05:09] who's going to shoot him right in the
[1:05:11] end she's on his horse looks at him
[1:05:15] then calmly just turned his horse around
[1:05:19] and he doesn't
[1:05:21] take off come on go ahead come on rc
[1:05:23] move
[1:05:27] turn his back slow officer slowly turns
[1:05:30] back to ferguson and then calmly
[1:05:32] cantered away
[1:05:33] let ferguson later discover from other
[1:05:35] british officers that it had been
[1:05:36] washington whom he had allowed to live
[1:05:39] ferguson lamented i'm sorry that i that
[1:05:41] i did not know at that time who it was
[1:05:44] it wouldn't matter anyway
[1:05:46] bullets what i got
[1:05:49] like in cartoons right
[1:05:51] god god was protecting him
[1:05:54] early historian george bancroft the
[1:05:56] father of american history because he
[1:05:57] wrote a lot about history
[1:05:59] reported other occasions of miraculous
[1:06:01] interventions
[1:06:03] in in washington's behalf we don't we
[1:06:05] don't read those words in our history
[1:06:06] book do we
[1:06:08] now
[1:06:10] anyway whatever
[1:06:12] including in 1777 when americans faced
[1:06:15] off against the british in battle of
[1:06:16] princeton washington this is a quotation
[1:06:19] this is a historian writing the father
[1:06:21] of american history writes this he says
[1:06:23] washington from his desire to animate
[1:06:26] his truth by example wrote in the very
[1:06:28] danger in front of danger and when he
[1:06:30] was less than 30 yards away this this
[1:06:32] evening i was going to paste it off
[1:06:33] brother i don't know how many paces from
[1:06:35] that wall to that wall over there
[1:06:37] i don't know that's
[1:06:39] that's a good
[1:06:41] 20 yards 25 yards something like that
[1:06:44] maybe
[1:06:45] that distance from the door to right
[1:06:46] here something like that
[1:06:48] what does he do
[1:06:50] he wrote in the very danger uh in front
[1:06:53] of danger and within and when within
[1:06:54] less than 30 yards of the british he
[1:06:56] reigned his horse
[1:06:59] with its head
[1:07:01] hello
[1:07:08] we go to the next slide brother i can't
[1:07:10] i lost the battery maybe the battery's
[1:07:11] gone from here or something
[1:07:13] is it under
[1:07:18] attack's ticking brother
[1:07:20] well i know what it is the time ran out
[1:07:22] and they
[1:07:24] they took the battery out
[1:07:26] they didn't want me to talk anymore
[1:07:27] that's what it is
[1:07:30] yeah you take this i like that strategy
[1:07:32] is that we i'll keep i'll shut him
[1:07:34] that'll shut him up
[1:07:38] wrong
[1:07:39] my wife has
[1:07:41] been doing that to me for many years and
[1:07:43] she hasn't found the right remote yet
[1:07:45] either
[1:07:48] okay course with his head towards them
[1:07:50] as both parties were about to fire can
[1:07:52] you imagine that he's the general he's
[1:07:54] the number one guy and he rides his
[1:07:57] horse out there in front of those guys
[1:07:59] from here to the wall and he says
[1:08:02] come on guys
[1:08:03] let's take them
[1:08:04] and they both level out like this
[1:08:08] let's see what it says
[1:08:12] seeming to tell his faltering forces
[1:08:14] they were faltering they were you know
[1:08:16] falling apart that they must stand firm
[1:08:18] or leave him to confront the enemy alone
[1:08:22] the two sides gave a volley at the same
[1:08:24] moment when the smoke cleared away it
[1:08:27] was thought a miracle that washington
[1:08:29] was untouched
[1:08:31] bancroft reports a similar outcome at
[1:08:33] the battle of trenton where's what's a
[1:08:35] battle of trenton the battle of trenton
[1:08:37] is the battle that takes place after
[1:08:40] right after he crosses the delaware
[1:08:42] okay
[1:08:43] so even though brother branham uh
[1:08:46] yeah that's the that's the one picture
[1:08:48] of the battle of trenton
[1:08:50] he's uh 28 battles never wounded in any
[1:08:53] of them
[1:08:54] brother ma'am tells us we had great men
[1:08:56] like george wash can we all stand george
[1:08:58] washington
[1:09:02] i hope you got a little teaser kind of
[1:09:04] sort of so to speak i could say that it
