tonight we count it a real privilege to be here we thank brother uh Benji there to invite us and the Phoenix Tabernacle to have us here tonight um we greet brother alar I believe he's here and all of the brothers the ministers and the young people that have come and we want to get right into the word of the lord it's true we uh we have a church there in tucon we started back in June just a little small group very small and but the Lord is with us I trust and you keep us in your prayers amen now how many of you here are Christian let me see your hand and you love the Lord Jesus with all your heart and do you know what the prophet of God said about that he said every time you come through those doors you either leave better or worse and if you are a Christian tonight you have to leave better tonight we're going to read from God's word it has all the power and authority that you and I need and so if you come expecting to hear from God he promised in his word I didn't make the promise Phoenix Tabernacle didn't make the promise but the Lord Jesus made the promise he said he would be with you all the way to the end and when We Gather in his name he said he would be there and so we want to uh bow our head for a word of prayer just for a moment and invite him to go deeper into our service tonight dear gracious Heavenly Father Just Want to Thank You Lord because your love never fails it is the reason that we're here tonight is because you loved us and your love constrained you to die for our sins and you made a way Lord Jesus for us to be here tonight speak to our hearts speak to the young and old every home that's here speak Lord touch their hearts we pray we commit this service into your hands we commit our tired bodies into your hands we commit all of our faults and our failures into your hands it's in your hands Lord whatever you want to do tonight may you have your way and we commit ourselves to you in Jesus name amen amen God bless you I'd like you to stand for the reading of God's word in Hebrews chapter 3 and we don't want to hold you long um we we'll probably take about 59 minutes all right Hebrews chapter 3 and verse one wherefore holy Brethren partakers of the Heavenly calling consider the Apostle and high priest of our profession Christ Jesus now he's the high priest of our profession and that word profession means a confession the profession and the confession um one more scripture in Romans uh chapter 10 R and verse number eight and I like to say I like to say this to the young people and any saint I believe you should bring your Bible to every service and a piece of paper and maybe a pencil because maybe just maybe the Lord might speak to you and you need to write that down and then you can take that home and read it again and I believe that's important so that's that's my little encouragement for all of you young people that didn't bring your Bible tonight I'll say it like this shame shame shame okay but next time bring your Bible bring a little notepad and write the dates down and what the Lord shared with you because you might need that later on in your life later this week is that all right in Romans chapter 10 and verse number8 but what sayith that the word is nigh thee even in thy mouth and in thy heart that is the word of faith which we preach that if Thou shalt confess with thy mouth the Lord Jesus and Shall Believe in thy heart that God hath raised him from the dead thou sht be saved for with the heart man believeth unto righteousness and with the mouth confession is made unto salvation and for our final scripture in Mark 11 verse 22 and 23 Jesus said have faith God the amen this is Mark 11 verse 23 for verily I say unto you that whosoever shall say unto this mountain be thou removed and be thou cast into the sea and shall not doubt in his heart but shall believe that those things which he saith shall come to pass he shall have whatsoever he saith dear Lord Jesus bless your word tonight bless your people in Jesus name amen amen I bless you you may be seated now for a title tonight the title of the message here is spoken words that defeat Satan spoken words that defeat Satan now the songs that we sing um the prayers that we pray they are just mere words but it's with the words that come out of our our mouth that is very very important to God and the devil will fool you and make you believe that anything coming out of your mouth you won't have to give an account for it but that's not true the Bible says we will give an account for every word spoken this is why this is why uh we don't joke and joke all the time the Bible warns us of that the Bible is always trying to encourage us to keep our words pure because our words mean something we want to go into this just a little bit to help you if the Lord be willing to to take the words of God that will defeat Satan now first off we want to say this here that a True Believer if he's standing behind the word head to head in a match against Satan Satan cannot touch the believer I don't care how powerful he is and all the Demonic forces that he has the weakest of Christians can defeat Satan anywhere any place any time under any circumstance and and you got to know that you have to believe that in your heart that head-to-head in a battle a True Believer will defeat Satan every time but how do we defeat him we defeat him by staying with our original artillery now now uh I will not say that we have more power than Satan in our Own Strength I cannot say that we know more than Satan and our own intellect but if we stay with God's word and stay behind his word Satan cannot win us he cannot win now this uh spoken word that defeats Satan many times at the at the end of brother bram's meeting I have a few prayers here that I'm going to read for you that that at the end of the meeting he he tells the people to repeat after him to repeat this prayer after me so it's not just brother brandom praying for me but you got to pray for yourself so the words have to come out of your mouth and we don't defeat the Devil by thinking good thoughts that's not the only way to defeat him it starts with good thoughts but we we don't defeat him by our good thoughts and we don't defeat the Devil by getting mad at him he don't care how mad you get he doesn't care that he uh that that he didn't play by the rules it doesn't matter to him you can cry you can get mad stop your feet and say it's not fair we don't defeat the the devil that way but there is a way to defeat him and God put it so plain in his word now as a believer the word of God is our weapon it is our strength it has to be consumed by the believer so we hear the word of God it comes in through our ears down into our spirit and then from our heart to our mind we meditate on the word of the Lord and we place that word down in our hearts and and as the word is taken in we we read it we hear it it comes into our spirit and we still have to do something to defeat the Devil just hearing it is not enough you hear it yes you read it yes but now to defeat him you've got to take the word that's in your heart in your mind that comes from the Bible then speak it out speak it and when you speak it believe what you said in your heart and you will have what you ask praise the lord it's got to work it has to work it's the only thing that will defeat Satan by the written word of God now brother brandom tells us that the Lord when he met Satan Matthew chapter 4 in The Temptations and Jesus defeated Satan with just taking the spoken word and brother random said he had many fine gifts that he could used on Satan but he didn't use any of his fine gifts he took the word he went into Deuteronomy 6 he took the words of Moses he said it's written and then Satan said well it's written also Jesus said it's written it's written and with the pure word of God spoken from his mouth he didn't use a supernatural power he didn't zap lightning upon his head he didn't turn him upside down and Shake him he just said it's written written it's written and he defeated Sat by Amen brother brandom said what Jesus was doing he was showing Jesus was showing us that the weakest Christian can defeat Satan with just the spoken word can you say amen amen amen yes sir now let's go a little bit further here all right let me read a quote for you here here the prophet of God says this here and the message Ministry explained he says when he met Satan or Satan met him he did not use any of his fine gifts which I believe that in him dwelt all the powers of heaven was in him but he never used any of them to defeat the enemy see when he met Satan Satan tempted him he said it's written man shall not live by bread alone then upon The Pinacle the temple he met him again with the word okay brother bam continues on and the message my angel shall go before thee he says this here he never used any of those gifts just to be your example he brought it to where the very weakest Christian now he had the power right then to rebuke Satan and send him away but what he did he never referred to any of his power he said if thou be the Son of God see Jesus said it's written it's the father's word so Jesus did that he had all the gifts in him all of Heaven dwelt in him and when he met Satan face the face he didn't use any power any Supernatural power and sometimes we think we need somebody to have a vision of us or interpret a dream to me or Lord let me see an angel or send me a visitation but Jesus didn't use any of that now we appreciate the gift we appreciate the visitation we appreciate the anointing but when he met Satan for your example for the weakest Christian he simply took the word and he said it's written it's written it's written that's right praise the Lord amen praise the Lord how many's ever been in a battle with Satan yes sir just half of you if you're a Christian I'm in a battle right now I going tell you the truth right now this is the nicest it'll ever get for us come on church say Amen we get to hear the singing we get to sit next to people we trust we don't have to worry about nobody still in our purse we can we can just relax we can even go to sleep in church we get so comfortable and this is the best that it can get for us we can sing praises to Him the anointing comes down we can say Amen to his word thank God for setting me free but then when I leave out there I know the devil he got a gun trained on me he wants to catch me he wants to get me to fall he wants to ruin my testimony he got I got a Target on my back brother Brandon said when you say that you received the Holy Ghost he said a big Target is put on your back and all of hell has got his guns trained white on that's right right so I'm in a battle you're in the battle my battle is not your battle your battle is not my battle but the battle is the Lord It's the Lord's battle and if I stay on his word he'll win every battle now so what happens what happens when a spirit attacks us when a demon power comes against us whether it's music if it's l if it's anger or temper how do I overcome that brother Israel do I think about doing good that's part of it that's part of it you think good thoughts as a man thinketh in his heart so e he this is why we take the word of the lord we place it in our heart we place it in our mind we place it in our spirit so when we come against the devil come on now when we come against the devil we can take this word right here and serve notice on him amen yes sir praise the Lord so see he did that thank you my brother he did that to show the weakest Christian how to do it now look at this quote here brother random tells this message here 1952 I want you to listen to this closely he says when one comes to the platform with an ounce of faith you hear another one out there screaming for help the one standing here on the platform maybe is dying with cancer another one sitting up there with cancer and this cancer knowing that he's facing down here if the woman would only believe you see she'll be healed then to throw that woman's Faith off the other demon scream down to her and I catch in between them and I say there both of you believe so here brother BR is talking about in the prayer line he said many times he'll be praying for someone with cancer can and then a demon out there with cancer will scream to this demon cancer and what they're screaming for is help help why are they screaming for help because on the platform if there is an ounce of faith I'm not talking about a pound of Faith come on church I'm talking about an ounce of faith if the devil recognizes that there's an ounce of Faith he starts screaming for help because he knows faith will defeat him by the word of God praise the Lord all right all right praise the Lord amen yes sir can I go a little bit further here here here the prophet of God says here quickly now all right here the prophet says this here he says see them demons are screaming one to the other you see for pity for Mercy they're calling and the angels of God are calling the battle is here now your Fai will determine which way it go so uh uh just to save a little bit of time brother bam says it uh several times and this message what is in thy hand 1955 he says if them demons out there are screaming here for help if it has to leave here it's defeated and out there too because the demons know one another And when they see Faith they've got to move they don't have to move because you got mad they don't have to move because you're crying that's not going to move no devil stomping and shouting that's not going to move them but when you have faith and you have faith in the word of God oh yes he's got to go he's got to go he must go because the word the word said so can you say Amen all right let's get let's get into the word now let's get into all right if you are a Believer I asked you if you were a Christian most of the hands went up if you are a Believer you must put this into practice if you want to keep the victory now the devil doesn't care if you come to church and don't have the victory but if you got the victory there's a way that you keep the victory this is why so many times during the special meetings the meetings are high there's a lot of special singing there's a special atmosphere the word is preached people that don't normally sing they'll sing people that are normally don't raise their hand they'll raise their hand that's during a special meeting and then a week or so later you go find those people you wonder where they at why they sto singing why they stopped coming to church how did they lose the victory they lost the victory because they didn't put this in practice see you've got to tell the devil to leave to leave you've got to tell him don't ask him don't wish him to go it's got to come out of your mouth Satan leave get out of my home get out of my mind get out of my body get out of my church get out of my life out of my testimony out of my worship out of my pra you got to tell him I can't tell him for you you can't tell him for me you got to say it out of your mouth hallah now many prayers brother brandham prayed we have them right here he'd get down to the end of his prayer and he'll say this he says now I want to speak to you Satan I want to serve notice on you now this is the prophet you can hear it on tape this is the Prophet come on this is the prophet speaking to Satan and he'll tell him I just want to let you know Satan that all of your powers have been stripped for Jesus Christ the son of God stripped every Power that you had he took every Power at Calvary and you have no more power you have no more hold on the people now I command to leave these people now how many's ever heard him pray that prayer have you heard him pray that prayer do you think the devil already knew that huh did the devil know that Jesus died at Calvary he heard it before you know the devil has to be cast out not just one time but for the rest of your life just get used to Cas him out get out of here devil out out I see you get out and you'll be doing that you'll be doing that for the rest of your life so Bram would take a portion of his prayer and direct it right to Satan can I read one for you can I yes sir yes I have 17 more minutes all right God bless you we won't hold you long let me read one all right all right here the prophet of God says this here he's reading this this is the message in Veil he's ending up a prayer and he says this now God I believe that you hear what I ask for and I believe that Jesus words are true whatever I would ask I would receive therefore now I I thank you for it now this is his prayer now he's quoting the scriptures back to God and he said I thank you for it and I turned to the adversary so he turns to the adversary Satan and I say Satan we stand as a representative of God we stand as a bloody cross goes before us representing the Son of God who died there for your defeat and you're nothing but a bluff there he was wounded for our transgressions with his stripes we are healed and you are only a blood trying to Bluff the people but your bluff has been called now you can't hold them no longer I adure you by the Living God the Lord Jesus Christ that you depart from them and bother them no more so who who was he talking to say it again in Spanish maybe they didn't hear me I asked question he was talking to Satan he told him we got a bloody cross before us stand his representative and then he tells him you have no power you're nothing but a blood [Applause] am all right now so the prophet of God takes a portion of his prayer directs it to Satan and what he's telling him oh you've been so bad to so many people and I'm so mad at you no no he talking about nothing about being mad took my money made me broke gave me a flat last week lose my job they ain't doing nothing you when you when you complain like that I suspect that the devil loves to hear that like what else did I do what else did I do keep praising me yeah yeah I did every time you complain like yeah but that's not that's not what the prophet's prayer was he talked about the blood and the cross and the power of Jesus amen amen yes sir okay let's go a little bit further I have at least two prayers or three that I want to read for you and I I trust it'll be a blessing to you I have to read these these prayers all the way through because they are really a blessing all right so let's go right into this here and if you want to as you're listening you can repeat the prayer also you know in Spanish or English am I'm going to read it for you here here in the message this is a prayer brother bandam says this here every one of you repeat this prayer after me do you believe that I know our Lord I know the the words that defeat Satan he says I'll say this and you repeat it every one of you repeat this prayer after me he says almighty God creator of heavens and earth author of everlasting life Giver of every good gift send your mercies upon me tonight I believe truly God the Father Almighty Jesus Christ His Son and the Holy Spirit I believe in the church that in this church God has set some prophets teachers and evangelists almighty God I now believe that I'm in the presence of that church I now accept the message of Divine Healing to myself from this night hence I shall trust you I'm going to believe that you healed me now for I accept my healing in your finished work at Calvary in the name of Jesus Christ I receive it so here brother Bram has the people to repeat this prayer and he asked them do you believe I know the words to defeat Satan then he says then repeat these words words after me well brother Bram why don't you just pray for us no no no because you have to you have to say it it's got to come from your mouth it's got to come from your heart it's got to come from your mind and then it's got to come from your mouth yes sir can I read one more prayer amen yes sir H Allelujah I can feel the anointing right now this is in the message Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever he says I want you to repeat this prayer you pray it I'll repeat it you pray it I'll just transfer the words that it takes to defeat Satan right to your lips then you believe your confession you that's sick repeat this with me he says almighty God creator of heavens and earth author of everlasting life Giver of all good gifts I your servant confess my sins and I believe that through the mer of thy son Jesus I'm forgiven of my sins I'm sick in my body and I need your help Give Me Faith just now to believe your word and to believe these things which I have seen tonight that re reproduces your life again as it was yesterday so it is today and now Lord upon this confession I accept my healing and I believe from tonight I shall be well I commit myself to you in the name of Jesus Christ amen Glory Glory Hallelujah can I read one more the prophet of God says this in the message Elijah Louisville Kentucky he says Lille Kentucky now I want this audience is standing here surely these are the words that will defeat Satan I'm just going to say them but I want you to pray them from your heart almighty God the author of everlasting life I have come with true sincere faith believing that you said blessed are they that hunger and thirst for righteousness for they shall be filled I've come hungering and thirsting for righteousness I believe that I shall be filled now I'm waiting father and I believe that you're going to fill me right right now with thy spirit in Jesus name I accept it won't you give the Lord a [Applause] praise there are several of these prayers where brother brandham identifies the words that defeat Satan he says you repeat after me I'll say it but you pray it from a sincere heart and it's got to take place it must happen amen yes sir as I prepare to close with all of these prayers just about every one of them the first thing that brother brandham does is he addresses the almighty God it's like Jesus says our uh uh what's the Lord's Prayer it says um Lord's Prayer our father so when you don't call everybody your father to call him father that means you got to be his son or his daughter so it set it said so no Jesus said Jesus taught him how to pray When you pray say this Our Father Glory who are in heaven holy is your name thy kingdom come thy will be done and in every one of these prayers brother brandom addresses the almighty God who is the author of all good gifts he is the author of everlasting life he is the author of everything I need he's the author and he addresses the author of everlasting life that can't be nobody else only one can hold that position of everlasting life Giver Giver of every good gift so he addresses his prayer just like that the next thing he does in these prayers is he always confesses faith in his word in every one of them and when he asks for the blessing this is the third thing he always ask for a present tense blessing in other words he says right now I believe you're going to feel me right now you're going to heal my body tonight this morning right now it's going to happen now see because the devil will tell you wait till the special meetings come wait until Sunday wait until next week but in every one of these prayers he not praying for God to do something way down the road he's calling on God I believe that tonight you're going to heal me tonight you're going to set me free tonight tonight yes sir Hallelujah so he addresses the almighty he confesses faith in the promised word and then he calls God to do it present tense God bless you I'll read one more prayer for you and I pray that you take this home with you if you can write a couple of these tag words down and go home and print them out for yourself that's just if you care about this if this is important to you words that defeat Satan that's important to me absolutely that's I fight him in my family I fight him on the job I fight him in my mind every day is a fight with this Satan and he's not going to he's not going to leave by me getting upset at it but if I take God's word with the ounce of Faith he's got to leave he's got to go let me read this last prayer God bless your heart here the prophet of God
