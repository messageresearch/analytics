[46:08] said
[46:10] praise the lord let's get started let's
[46:12] have a round of applause for
[46:13] brother luke amen
[46:17] this comes from the first chapter of the
[46:19] book of luke
[46:21] verse 5 to 25. there was in the days of
[46:25] herod
[46:25] the king of judea a certain priest named
[46:28] zacharias
[46:29] of the course of abia and his wife was
[46:31] of the daughter of aaron
[46:33] and her name was elizabeth and they were
[46:36] both righteous
[46:37] before god walking in all commandments
[46:39] and ordinances
[46:40] of the lord blameless that means they
[46:43] were very good people
[46:46] believed in god praise god and they had
[46:49] no
[46:49] child because that elizabeth was barren
[46:52] and they both
[46:52] were now well stricken in years which
[46:55] means they were really
[46:56] old and they could not have a child
[46:59] because they were so old
[47:01] but what is my favorite saying who knows
[47:02] what my favorite saying is
[47:08] amen with god all things are possible
[47:10] give him a round of applause
[47:11] that's right
[47:15] and it came to pass that while he
[47:17] executed the priest's office before god
[47:20] in the ordinance of his course according
[47:22] to the custom of the priest's office
[47:24] his lot was to burn incense when he went
[47:27] into the temple of the lord so who are
[47:28] we talking about
[47:30] what's his name zacharias
[47:33] and what was he doing
[47:40] amen and the whole multitude of the
[47:42] people were praying without
[47:43] at the time of the incense and there
[47:45] appeared unto him an angel of the lord
[47:47] standing on the right side
[47:48] of the altar of incense and when
[47:50] zachariah saw him
[47:52] he was troubled and fear fell upon him
[47:55] but the angel said unto him fear not
[47:57] zacharias for thy prayer is heard
[48:00] and thy wife elizabeth shall bear thee a
[48:02] son and thou
[48:03] shalt call his name john wow
[48:07] and thou shalt have joy and gladness and
[48:10] many
[48:10] shall rejoice at his birth for he shall
[48:13] be great in the sight of the lord
[48:15] and shall drink neither wine nor strong
[48:17] drink and he shall be filled with the
[48:18] holy ghost even from his mother's womb
[48:22] praise god and many of the children of
[48:25] israel
[48:26] shall be turned to the lord their god
[48:28] and he shall
[48:29] go before him in the spirit and power of
[48:32] elias
[48:32] to turn the hearts of the fathers to the
[48:34] children and the disobedient
[48:36] to the wisdom of the just to make ready
[48:39] a people prepared for the lord
[48:41] and zechariah said unto the angel
[48:43] whereby shall i know this for i am
[48:46] old i'm an old man and my wife is well
[48:49] stricken in years
[48:50] so did he believe his angel he
[48:52] questioned the angel
[48:55] he doubted the angel how could this be
[48:57] because i'm so old
[48:59] and my wife is so old it's impossible
[49:02] but guess what with god all things are
[49:04] possible thank you
[49:06] can you all say that with god
[49:09] things are possible amen and the angel
[49:12] answered
[49:13] answering said unto him i am gabriel
[49:15] that standeth in the presence of god
[49:18] and am sent to speak unto thee and to
[49:20] show thee
[49:21] these glad tidings and behold thou shalt
[49:25] be dumb
[49:26] and not be able to speak until the day
[49:28] that these things shall be performed
[49:30] because thou believeth not my words
[49:32] which shall be fulfilled in their season
[49:34] so what does that mean if somebody is
[49:36] dumb
[49:37] that you will be dumb what does that
[49:38] mean
[49:40] yes in the grace what's it my
[49:52] and the people waited for zacharias and
[49:54] marvel that he tarried so long in the
[49:56] temple
[49:57] and when he came out he could not speak
[49:59] unto them and they perceived that he had
[50:01] seen a vision in the temple
[50:03] for he beckoned unto them and remained
[50:05] speechless
[50:06] and it came to pass that as soon as the
[50:08] days of his administration were
[50:10] accomplished
[50:10] he departed to his own house and after
[50:13] those days his wife elizabeth conceived
[50:15] and hurt and hid herself five months
[50:18] saying
[50:19] thus hath the lord dealt with me in the
[50:21] days wherein he looked on me
[50:23] to take away my approach reproach among
[50:25] men
[50:27] amen can you give him a round of

[55:08] we're going to be reading from luke 1
[55:10] 26-38
[55:12] and in the sixth month the angel gabriel
[55:14] was sent to god
[55:16] unto a city of galilee named nazareth
[55:19] to a virgin espoused to a man whose name
[55:21] was joseph
[55:23] of the house of david and the virgin's
[55:25] name was
[55:26] mary and the angel
[55:29] came unto her and said hail thou
[55:32] thou art highly favored the lord is with
[55:35] thee
[55:36] blessed art thou among women
[55:40] and when she saw him she was troubled at
[55:42] his saying
[55:43] and cast in her mind what manner of
[55:45] salutation
[55:46] this should be and the angel said to her
[55:50] fear not mary for thou has found favor
[55:53] with god
[55:55] and behold thou shalt conceive in thy
[55:57] womb
[55:58] and bring forth his son and shall call
[56:01] his name
[56:02] jesus he shall be great
[56:05] and shall be called the son of the
[56:07] highest and the lord god shall give him
[56:10] the throne of his father david and he
[56:13] shall reign over the house of jacob
[56:14] forever and his kingdom there shall be
[56:17] no end
[56:19] then said mary unto the angel how should
[56:21] this be
[56:22] seeing i know not a man and
[56:25] the angel answered and said unto her the
[56:28] holy ghost shall come upon thee
[56:30] and the power of the highest shall
[56:32] overshadow thee
[56:34] therefore also that holy thing
[56:38] which shall be born of thee shall be
[56:40] called
[56:41] the son of god
[56:44] the son of god praise the lord and
[56:47] behold thy cousin elizabeth

[56:52] age

[57:06] handmaid of the lord

[1:01:20] and entered into the house of zacharias

[1:01:29] heard the salutation of mary the babe
[1:01:32] leaped
[1:01:32] in her womb and elizabeth was filled
[1:01:35] with the holy ghost

[1:11:37] augustus
[1:11:38] that all the world should be taxed and
[1:11:40] this taxing was first made when
[1:11:42] cyrenius was governor of syria and all
[1:11:45] went to be taxed
[1:11:46] everyone into his own city and joseph
[1:11:49] also went up
[1:11:50] from galilee out of the city of nazareth
[1:11:53] into judea unto the city of david which
[1:11:56] is called
[1:11:57] bethlehem because he was of the house
[1:11:59] and lineage
[1:12:00] of david to be taxed with mary his
[1:12:03] espoused wife
[1:12:04] being great with child and so it was
[1:12:07] that
[1:12:07] while they were there the days were
[1:12:09] accomplished that
[1:12:10] she should be delivered and she brought
[1:12:13] forth her first born son
[1:12:15] and wrapped him in swaddling clothes and
