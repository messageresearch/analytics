church amen you may be [Music] seated God bless you well tonight we have another installment in our series on on the book of Supernatural the life of William Branham the series of books we're in book two the young man in his desperation 1933 to 1946 we've now reached chapter 17 a hopeful marriage 1934 to 1935 one thing we all have to remember is no matter how tough life's travails and troubles may get to us we have to remember God's Divine love overcomes all and when we have that Divine love inside of us for our fellow brother there's nothing that can stop God's word tonight's chapter demonstrates that Willam Mary and brandham married Amelia Hope brumbach on Friday June 27 1934 bill was 25 years old Hope was almost 21 they rented a little house at 434 Graham Street not far from Brenham Tabernacle the place only had two rooms one side they used for both their living room and their bedroom the other side was a kitchen the house had no running water hope had to carry their water from a public faucet a block away overall it wasn't much of a house but for $4 a month it was the most they could afford the newly LEDs were starting their married life with very few assets Bill owned a wornout leather couch in his Ford Motorcar Bill's mother gave them a small iron bedstead someone gave them an old folding bed at a junkyard Bill bought a used cooking stove for 75 then he paid a $125 to get new grates to put in the stove hope went to work at F's shirt factory to help earn enough money to buy some more furniture soon they had saved enough to buy an unpainted breakfast set from Sears for $3.98 Bill painted the set yellow with a big green Shamrock on the table in the seat of each chair because Hope was always teasing him about being Irish the breakfast set improved their home considerably still the rigid wooden chairs were not made for relaxing bill would get so tired working two jobs in the daytime and tending to his pastoral responsibilities in the evenings he wished he could plop back into a cushion lounge chair at night prop up his feet and rest while he read his Bible with hope working Bill thought perhaps they could afford a comfortable piece of furniture together they drove across the river to Louisville to shop for a well padded club chair they found a Morris chair priced at only $16.98 that didn't seem Out Of Reach filled with the excitement that comes from a new experience Bill gave the store clerk $3 for the down payment and drove home with that beautiful green Morris chair they positioned it in a corner of his bedroom Bill sank back into its velvety soft Contours filling his lungs with the refreshing fragrance of new fabric he can think of only one word to describe it Heavenly that Morris chair was by far the biggest luxury Bill had yet owned after walking the high lines all day and preaching around town half the night the mois chair welcomed his tired muscles into its restful cushions over the next month Bill often fell asleep in his chair with his Bible lying open on his lap lovingly hope would urge him to get up so she could put him to bed his purchase soon created a problem Bill had not expected by the terms of the contract he was supposed to pay $1 a week on his debt it proved to be money that he badly needed elsewhere as the weeks went by the dollar a week payments did more and more damage to his precarious Budget on the seventh week Bill missed his first payment he just didn't have a dollar to spare then next week was no better when Bill missed his third payment in a row the finance company called Bill apologized with a heavy heart suggested they come take the chair back a few days later when bill came home from work the kitchen was filled with the smell of a freshly baked cherry pie his favored pie after supper he ate two pieces of pie smothered with hot sorg and molasses he kidded hope why are you being so good to me tonight she smiled as if she were hiding something bill I had the neighbor boy dig some worms this afternoon why don't we go down to the river and fish a little while that struck bill as odd because hope didn't care much for fishing first let's go in the other room and sit so I can let this cherry pie settle no Bill Let's Go Fishing right away her words sounded almost pleading honey what happened today hope said nothing but her eyes were moist Bill suspected the trouble so he said again let's go into the other room first when her face dropped Bill knew he was right he put his arm around her and together they walked through the doorway the Mo's chair was gone hope laid her head on Bill's chest and sobbed oh bill I tried to keep it for you I tried hard Bill squeezed her gently I know sweetheart it's not your fault we couldn't help it but one of these days things will be different someday God Will Make A Way and we'll have a nice chair she tilted her head so she could look into her husband's reassuring eyes I hope so Bill despite the inevitable hardships of poverty Bill and hope brandham were very happy together they treasured each other and their boundless love smoothed over the ditches and potholes in their Road in December of 1934 hope became pregnant they were both thrilled with the idea of having a baby because Bill's lineage was Irish and hopes was German he teased her by saying if it's a boy we're going to name him hindrik Michael hope gasp oh bill that sounds horrible on September 13th 1935 hope went into labor she had a difficult time and nearly died during the delivery Bill walked for Miles back and forth across the floor of the hospital waiting room at 3: :00 in the afternoon the baby cried at that same moment Bill shouted thank you Lord it is a boy and his name Shall be Called Billy Paul in a few minutes the doctor came out of the delivery room with a smile he said Reverend brandham I might charge you for this lenol and floor you've worn out but it would be worth it you've got a boy after Bill made certain his wife was all right he couldn't resist the joke honey I changed my mind I don't think we should name him h Michael since he was born on Friday the 13th I think we should name him Jinx she laughed but Bill I wanted to name him after his father then will'll name him after his father and also after the great Apostle St Paul we'll call him Billy Paul in October of 1935 the newspapers announced that musolini had invaded Ethiopia Ethiopia Italy with its Modern War Machine had rumbled into that backward country and had quickly crushed all Ethiopian resistance Europe expressed his outrage at this unexpected Invasion by immediately slapping economic sanctions on Italy Bill read the news with Keen interest he did not understand what strange Force allowed him to see into the future but whatever it was the events he always saw always happen he wondered again how such a gift could come from the devil like his Minister friends insisted he felt confused one Sunday after church Bill overheard Walt Johnson say you ought to have heard them Holy Rollers last night Bill stepped into the conversation what was that brother Walt Walt was chewing on a piece of dried orange peel for indigestion Pentecostals Billy you've never seen anything like it they were jumping up and down and rolling on the floor and they said that if you didn't jabber off in some kind of unknown language you weren't saved where's that at a tent meeting on the other side of Louisville the group calls themselves the House of David and they're calling these meetings the school of the prophets colored people of course oh that explains it said Bill knowing how fanatically some colored people Express their religion there were a lot of white people there too really did they do that too yes they did it too that's funny and people get mixed up in stuff like that bill shook his head well I guess we're bound to get to those things the report sparked Bill's curiosity and Monday night he drove across the river to Louisville to check it out although he didn't see anyone rolling on the floor the crowd was certainly excited about something and they did seem to have some strange doctrines during the service and unusual middle-aged man stood up to testify he reminded bill of an Old Testament Prophet with graying hair down to his shoulders and a curly beard that tumbled down over his chest his testimony was as striking as his appearance he introduced uced himself as John Ryan from daak Michigan he said the Lord had told him to come down to Louisville Kentucky to testify at that meeting he spoke about the power of God the fire of Pentecost and the baptism of the Holy Spirit his testimony carried such energy and conviction that bill decided he wanted to meet this peculiar man they talked for a long time after church John Ryan said that as a young man he was an acrobat in a circus for years he had belonged to the Catholic church but after he gave his heart to Jesus Christ he became a Pentecostal and now he traveled as the Lord led him testifying about the power of God wherever he went Bill told him about the seven-part vision he had seen in June of 1933 when John Ryan learned that one of the parts foresaw melini's invasion of Ethiopia Ryan could scarcely contain his enthusiasm and ask if they could talk more about it later that was fine with Bill so he invited the older man home to spend the night in the morning they sat for a long time around the kitchen table while Bill shared some of his uncanny experiences he felt more freedom talking to this Stranger than he did talking to ministers whom he had known for years John Ryan encouraged bill to pay close attention to the Visions suggesting that they might be the voice of God speaking to him then he talked about something he called the Pentecostal experience which he said was the power of God as a dynamic living force in a Christian's life Bill couldn't grasp his meaning the man used unfamiliar terms like baptism of the Holy Ghost speaking in tongues and interpretation of tongues but one thing was clear John Ryan definitely believed in what he was saying he grew animated as he talked suddenly he threw up his hands and began to speak in some kind of gibberish language after a minute he stopped then he walked around the table laid his hand on Bill's shoulder and said brother Billy this is the interpretation you're just a lad now there's a lot of Youth to you yet but someday that will settle down and almighty God will use you to stir the Nations God bless [Applause] you amen how many believe that what brother spread brother Fred uh the book that he reads is a blessing to us amen amen amen next up we're going to have our sister joy and sister Josephine so if you guys want to make

click the arrow right there go ahead and click it one more time there you go can I get a brave soul to tell me what that says you want to help me Zoe come on can you give Zoe a round of applause please okay worship for he is for who he is praise for what he has done wow can you give her another round of applause so there's a difference between praise and worship When We Worship the Lord worshiping him for who he is you are Jehovah Lord God Almighty you are Jehovah we're worshiping who Jehovah is and and when we praise if somebody gives you praise that because you're super good at basketball or or or you scored a goal in your soccer team or like Hannah Jasmine and and um Emily they're really good at volleyball or the specials that were today Daniel man you did awesome on the piano buy sister Bethany Beth the young sisters Sam and Gabriella they sing beautifully I'm praising them for what they did so so when we praise God we're praising God for what he did look what Jesus did for me that's fine Look what Jesus did for me have you sing that that song say look what Jesus did for me he what he save me and he gave me the victory yes look what so awesome so can some so everybody understands there's a difference right we go to the next one but they're both awesome what do we do when we worship God I get somebody to to read this your boys hands lifted hands lifted like this can you show me how to lift up your hands well that's how a lot of us lift our hands but can can someone actually show me how to lift up our hands boys one more time let's lift our hands like this yeah boys representing give the boys a round of applause why do we lift up our hands does anybody know to smell what kind of deodorant we have on to scratch our heads when we have a itch to touch the roof why do we lift up our hands raise your hands if you think you know Benji why do we lift up our hands uh to praise God to praise God a great answer did you know that sorry I'll slow down I'll slow down pinch me buddy pinch me if I'm going too fast did you know that when you're in a war and the enemy is surrounding you if you don't want to die you could raise up your hands and say I surrender I Surrender don't shoot did you know you can do that so A lot of times we fight God and we make our heart really hard and we don't let God have his way in US so we're in the battle with god I don't want to listen to you God no no I don't want to worship you right now God but God is trying to fight through you to help you so when you lift up your hands you're saying I Surrender God you can have your way in me do we understand there's another example and a reason why we lift up our hands did you know that one time Moses was with the children of Israel in the desert and the enemy came and attacked them can you come be Moses for me Daniel where's chicken and and um and Mikey so pretend you guys right there are the enemy and the children of Israel and you're fighting and there a war with the children of Israel and all of a sudden we have Moses here with two of his friends and Moses raised up his hands and as long as Moses's hands were raised the children of Israel were winning but if Moses said I'm tired and he started putting his hands down oh Benji died oh oh the the children of Israel are getting hurt they're losing the enemy just gave him a wedgie No Moses what are you doing hands up then all of a sudden they got superpowers and then God came down and they started winning again but then Moses got super tired he said I'm an old man I can't lift up my hands like that I can't lift up my hands like that and they started losing again so then these guys had to hold up his hands and as long as Moses's hands were lifted the children got the victory can you believe that look at the picture poor little Moses had to lift up his hands like this with people holding it thank you can you give them a round of applause so what does that tell us what am I trying to say Can somebody come and tell [Music] me what did he say he said to lift up your hands and to sing round ofuse thank you Abraham but why do we lift up our hands because if our hands are lifted the enemy cannot beat us as long as our hands are lifted to God you'll give us the power to overcome with my hands lifted up and my heart full of Praise oh oh with a Heart of Thanksgiving I Will Bless thee oh Lord I Will Bless thee Oh Lord with my hands lifted up and my mouth full of Praise with my hands lifted up can you lift your hands up and sing that with me and my mouth full of Praise amen with my heart with My Heart of [Music] Thanksgiving I Will Bless oh Benji doesn't have his hands up I'm getting weak I'm losing I'm Lo with my hands it up let's all lift up our hands please and my mouth full of Praise thank you with a heart with a heart of [Music] thanksgiv I Will Bless thee Oh Lord Give the Lord a round of applause that's why we lift up our hands amen go to the next slide please and just in case you don't believe me I'm going to read it for you so it came about when Moses held his hands up that Israel prevailed and when he let his hands down the amalec prevailed but Moses's hands were heavy then they took a stone and put it under him and he sat on it and Aaron and her supported his hands one on one side one on the other thus his hands were steady until the sunset amen so I said it and you might not have believed me but now that the word says it can we say Amen to the Bible amen can we go to the next one now when children Worship the Lord there's what can everybody read that word I can't hear you what does that say oh that's the saddest power I've ever heard can I hear it one more time when children Worship the Lord there's what let's say Spanish everybody look at this beautiful little African baby worshiping the Lord can we go to the next slide I want I want you to know what the Bible says about children that Worship the Lord Psalms what Psalms 8 verse two can you say that with me Psalms 8 verse two let's say it in Spanish repeat after me there you go remember this children cuz you're children this is for you I'll for you if you just wait to finish my sentence okay through the Praises of who children through the Praises of children and infants you have established a stronghold against your enemies to silence the foe that anybody know what foe means what does foe mean enemy to silence your Foe and the Avenger and I'm not talking about the super Avengers I'm not talking about Iron Man okay or Captain America The Avengers are the enemies of God they want to avenge him so I'm going to see that again cuz wow wow wow through the Praises of children and infants who's a child here where are the infants see adanah and Gideon my Sons they're 1 and 2 years old they're babies and they're around the house and all of a sudden you'll hear Gideon go like what is he doing and I realized he's singing cuz adanah is singing power in the name of Jesus your power I'm like this little kid two years old praising the Lord in his diaper he's like and I'm like that's awesome it just melts my heart through the Praises of children and infants you have established a stronghold against your enemies that means go ahead the best I think is that sound right I think she said yes thank you awesome so when children Worship the Lord then then the enemy is stopped and silence if somebody says there's no God and we get a bunch of little kids like you to sing my God is an awesome God from heaven [Music] above God is an Awesome our God is an awesome God he reigns from heaven above power and love our God is an awesome God if we can get a group of children look at Abraham worshiping praise God if we could worship like him even the people that don't believe in God will get sh shaken and they'll have to start rethinking what what they think about God one time my mother-in-law from California came with one of her friends from work and they were having lunch at our house and everybody uh her friends started to eat right away but adanah was like wait got to say Amen so he held his hands out like this and Lizzie grabbed his hands because we teach him to pray at the table and this adah must have been what old baby one and a half not even two yet so we were teaching him to pray so he goes Jesus uh thank you for Pap amen amen it's cute huh but my mother-in-law's coworker was shocked she's like what is different about this family and my mother-in-law had an opportunity to share the gospel with her let me tell you I have uh taught my children the importance of worship and prayer she say I've just never seen a child want to pray so freely but we're a different type of people huh kids aren't we different type of people we have a real God don't we can we go to the next one please singing to the Lord look at these children beautiful huh man can we go to the next one can we get A Brave Young soul to come read this scripture for us you want to come read this Benji come on up make Benji feel welcome please when our when our children volunteer to to do a service for the Lord we should encourage [Music] them let the word let the word of Christ dwell in you richly teach and abolishing one another in all wisdom singing Psalms and hymns and spiritual songs and thankfulness in in your heart to god wow isn't that beautiful you want to try to read that I'm going to just talk a little bit while he finds the scripture Colossians 3:16 it says let the word of Christ dwell in you richly what does dwell mean be in you live in you so the word of God is going to live in you and it says teaching and admonishing one another that means help each other teach each other one another we want to encourage each other through praise you want to read [Music] that amen amen look to your neighbor and say I want to encourage you in the name of the Lord tell your neighbors I encourage you in the name of the Lord let's sing together in the name of the Lord you want to know who else sang together in the name of the Lord can we go to the next slide please Paul and Silas PA they were in prison you know why they were in prison [Music] why he said said that in the city where Paul and Silas were there were idolators and and they didn't want to worship God and so because Paul and Silas were worshiping God they put him in prison can you say it again they didn't want them to Worship the Lord that's very good answer Benji Paul and Silas casted out a demon from a woman and that demon was of Prophecy or fortune telling the the and and the owner of that woman because she was a slave was so mad that she was delivered from that demon that they called the police cuz they Paul and Silas messed with their business investment and they threw them in prison but right there in prison how many think they would have said Lord I was doing your work and now I'm in prison I'm never going to preach anymore I'm never going to pray for anybody anymore I try to do something good for God and they throw me in jail with the liars and the thieves and the murderers how many think they had that kind of attitude no they raised their hands
