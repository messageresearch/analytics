[Music] [Applause] off God bless you I come to you in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and I'd like to welcome you to children's church today we have a another chapter in the life of our Prophet William and Mary and brandham from the book Supernatural the life of William branam this is from book two the young man in his desperation which covers the years 1933 to 1946 uh more importantly every chapter in this series done by our precious brother Oren jurgenson brings with it a lesson this particular chapter is somewhat graphic at times I'll let you know in advance however two things I would like for each and every one of you to take from this chapter and young people as well and young at heart never let your spiritual guard down don't get involved with things that run contrary to the Holy Spirit Spirit as you'll see that will be a theme in this chapter and more importantly you'll notice that later in the chapter there's something that brother Brandon says that makes all the difference I want you to listen closely for that so as we start this is chapter 16 the title is like a bat out of hell 1933 to 1934 the construction on the corner lot of a and Pinn streets was finished in late September of 1933 out of love and respect for their Pastor the congregation voted to call the building brandham Tabernacle it didn't look like a typical Church structure it had no steeple no large cross no sharply pitched roof no vaulted ceiling it was a simple concrete block building with a gently pitched roof a false front and a plain rectangular windows and doors some people in the area joke that it look looked more like a garage or storage shed than a church but to William brandham it looked beautiful he positioned his pulpit in the exact spot where he had been kneeling when the Lord had given him his inspiration to buy this piece of land he placed three crucifixes at the point of the auditorium one on the pulpit one on each side of the wall behind the pulpit just like had seen them positioned in the vision the entire project cost $2,000 to complete with the bank allowing 20 years to pay off the mortgage that was a lot of money for a poor congregation to finance in the middle of the Great Depression to make sure that Brenham Tabernacle could pay its monthly obligations Bill refused to take any of the people's tithes and offerings for his own living expenses preferring instead to plow the money back into the building Bill kept hisob job at Public Service Indiana although he did transfer to another department now he was a lineman in charge of patrolling the high voltage power lines had ran through the wooded Countryside the job Blended so well with his duties as a game warden that he could often do both task at the same time that was fortunate because he still was not earning any money from his work as a game warden one day Bill had kept the construction cost down on the brandham Tabernacle was to leave the floor in dirt when the ground froze outside the floor of the auditorium froze too Bill showed up early for one Wednesday night's service and fired up two cold two coal stoves to take the chill out of the sanctuary before the congregation began to arrive the people walked into the church on frozen ground but by the time the service ended the floor had thawed into a muddy gooey mess grandmothers and granddaughters alike sank up to their ankles as they struggled to get outside although they all had a hearty laugh about it afterwards they also covered the floor with sawdust so it wouldn't happen again Bill embraced his duties as a pastor with the energy of Youth and the Zeal of a young man who had finally discovered his passion besides such expected duties as preaching counseling and praying for the sick he also led to singing paid the debts and cleaned out the ashes of out of the stove whatever came along that needed doing bill volunteered his time being a new pastor on top of being a new Christian filled Bill's days with learning experiences some predictable others quite outlandish coming home one Saturday night in his car Bill's headlights outlined a drunk staggering in the street it turned out to be Wayne bledo a young man who had been a friend of Bill's brother Edward prohibition was still en forced so Bill put Wayne in the car and took the drunk home with him before the man stumbled into the hands of the law he helped Wayne into the house put him in his own bed and then made a place for himself to sleep on the couch Wayne aren't you ashamed of yourself Bill scolded uh Billy uh don't say that Billy drinking is no answer it will kill you before your time what you should do is give your life over to Jesus that will stretch your time into eternity Oh Billy Bill laid his hands on Wayne's forehead I'm going to pray for you Wayne outside a taxi drove up a cab door slammed and Bill heard footsteps running up the sidewalk a woman knocked frantically on the door calling brother Bill brother Bill Bill thought my goodness somebody must be dying he flipped on the lights pulled on his clothes and ran to the door 18-year-old Nelly Sanders stood in the doorway her face pale her eyes red and puffy Nelly come in Nelly Stepped inside Oh Billy I'm gone I'm gone what's the matter Nelly are you having a heart attack no brother Bill I came down from Spring Street and honest brother Bill I didn't mean any harm Bill's mind was spinning wondering how to deal with this hysterical girl now calm down sister tell me about it Nelly was a new Christian herself one of Bill's converts from his tent meetings in June before she gave her heart to Jesus she had been one of the best dancers in town and her dance partner Lee horn still had the trophies to prove it Nelly took a deep breath to quiet her shaking hands she tried to speak slowly and distinctly but her words picked up speed until at the last moment she sounded barely intelligible I was walking by Redmond's Hall and I heard dance music I stopped for a minute to listen the music kept sounding better and better I said Lord you know I love you but I sure can remember times when Lee and I used to win all those trophies and awards maybe if I walk up these steps I'll be able to testify to some of those people so I walked up on the steps and before I knew what I was doing I was out on the dance floor in some boy's arms Oh Billy am I now lost for good I don't want to end up like Margie Billy remembered Margie the girl in the scanny swimming suit who had refused to get out of her road booat when he had asked her to leave the day he was baptizing converts after his Revival meeting when that mysterious star came down from the sky Margie fainted later she started drinking during a barroom brawl someone slashed her in the face with a broken bottle scarring her terribly the last bill it heard she was in an insane institution Nelly was so upset she was shaking Bill tried to console her no sister you're not lost but you did make a mistake when you stopped for a minute to listen to the devil's voice calling you back to what you were before you met Jesus Jesus I haven't been a Christian long but I already know that the greatest battle ever fought is in the human mind it's the battle between faith and doubt are you going to believe God's word or doubt it you have to make your own choice Oh Billy I want to choose faith in Jesus Wayne bledo had sobered a little and was sitting up in in the bed watching curious about the commotion I don't know much about the Bible Bill said but I believe Jesus said this in my name shall they cast out Devils placing his hand on Nelly's shoulder he prayed devil I don't know who you are but this is my sister and you ain't got no business holding her you're going to have to come out of her now you hear me the screen door began to open and close rapidly by itself bangy bangy bangy bang Nelly's eyes widen Billy lookie there what's going on bill was just as surprised I don't know he looked back at Nelly and prayed leave her Satan in Jesus name come out of her as soon as Bill mentioned the name of Jesus a shadowy spectre Rose from behind Nelly Sanders looking like a giant bat with long hair dangling from its wings and feet it growled a guttural RAR and came at Bill who cried out blood of Jesus protect me the demon changed its course and flew Towards the bed where Wayne was sitting it circled once then disappeared into the bed wildeyednorthernboy Wayne yelled tore off his covers and sprinted for the Next Room Bill drove Nelly home when he came back he and his mother took the bed apart and shook the sheets there was nothing there troubled Bill mentioned this incident to several ministers each one of them basically said the same thing Billy brandham the days of casting out devils are over besides a man can't see a demon anyway it must have been your imagination Bill might have have dismissed this as his imag in ination except that both Wayne and Nelly had seen the operation too was this the demon that was plaguing him continually was it following him was it near him all the time was it responsible for all the peculiar happenings in his life including the Visions thoughts like these tormented him constantly making Bill wonder why his life seemed to be so different from the other Christian ministers that he knew God bless you [Music] d [Music] [Music] [Music] hey man God bless you how are you doing today it's nice to see smiling faces how many love that the scripture says wherever two or more are gathered that his spirit will be there amen we don't

I was talking to professor and he was tell me that he had a fun fact can we put his can we put the fun fact on there no go back in there there you go see did you know that a as a Christian you grow and graduate every single day in your Christian walk see when you read your Bible and pray every day you will grow grow grow how many of you knew that that every day as a Christian you grow stronger When you pray and you read your Bible did you know that it's because the Bible brother Mike the B the word says it's our daily bread that's right so when you eat your food when you eat your Bible and you pray that's like when the spirit comes down that's like your water so you need to drink and eat the word of God and pray so you can grow yeah I mean that's that's that's what's called a those are what's called good habits and they're actually not even good habits they're needs and they're not even needs we will die spiritually if we don't eat yes right how many like to eat real food hey man see just about everybody right and what happens if you go you know three four if you miss lunch at school if you got up late and you're running and you you know I don't have time for breakfast cuz I'm going to be late to school and then you you go to school and you had to stay over because maybe you didn't do your homework and you had to work through through lunch and you didn't eat lunch and you get home and you're just starving has that ever happened to anybody sometimes people go days without eating who can go days oh no one time I went three four five six minutes without eating and I was like oh my gosh I'm hungry imagine days so could could you imagine your spirit that needs to be in constant contact with God Professor when you don't feed on his word or you don't talk to him imagine if you came home and your mama didn't talk to you for an hour 2 hours 3 hours 4S hours a day two days you'd be like what's going on here right Professor oh it's so sad why isn't my mama talking to me what did I do could you imagine how God feels when we don't talk to him God gives us all the good things that we have we're pretty blessed right amen what do you think Professor you've met children all around the world professor and the children of the United States are pretty blessed for the most part am I right we have everything I was in the country next next to Brazil and I think it was Paraguay and we went and we were walking through the streets and a little boy came to me asking me for money but I didn't have any money and he was barefoot he didn't even have shoes or socks true story and I was like mik well where are your shoes and socks and he's like I don't I don't speak English so then I had to get The Interpreter to tell him where are your shoes and socks he said oh I don't have any so where's your mommy and daddy well I don't have a mom and dad I live with my brother by the dumpster wow and I'm like what here I don't have any money like what can I do to help and he said I'll take your socks if you can give me your socks that that would help I said for reals you want my stinky socks like infested with my P juice and he's like yes and I said The Interpreter said what are you going to do with those socks he said I'm going to I'm not going to be as cold tonight I'll tell you that much and I said I started crying I'm like you can have my socks I gave him my socks he was so happy wow I mean how many of us have more than one pair of socks here right simple things right right simple things and we're so thankful so we should be thankful to God because he gives us everything everything there is nothing that we don't have that he doesn't give us praise God that's right so today we want to talk a little bit Professor about things that we should be doing over the summer right when we have time on our hands oh yes yes you know so I outlined just a simple little schedule here for young Christians and it isn't this doesn't have to be exactly uh the same thing that you're doing but if you look on the paper there what do you think Professor oh I love it what do you think is the first thing we should do when we get up in the morning the first thing we should do is pray right there by your bed if you if you can't if you don't know how to get on your knees next to your bed and you're too tired well pray start praying right there while you hug your pillow you wake up and you're like oh thank God that I have a pillow and I have five more minutes so you just pray to God whatever you can at first and then gradually as you continue practicing how to pray you will get better that's right cuz a lot of people brother Mike they tell me I don't know how to pray and brother brandham even at one point in his life he shared with us that he didn't know how to pray so he wrote God a letter he wrote God a letter and he had a revelation that God lived in the wilderness and in nature so he wrote God a a letter and he put it on a tree wow isn't that special that's pretty awesome huh so if you don't know how to pray I know you all have Facebook so post something right or write a letter if you don't have Facebook good write a letter to God put your heart on paper for him amen so remember start off with the things that you're thankful for oh I'm getting up Professor oh man I'm glad I'm getting up because nothing is for sure that's true some people go to bed and the next morning they don't wake up or they wake up dead well I didn't want to say it like that but yeah Professor oh my bad but it's true you know it's true and we should be thankful you know we should be thankful that we get up and we're in our comfortable bed with our cover and that our mommy and our daddy are there and that they're providing all these good things and then we should think about all the people that we love oh my grandparents my aunties my uncles you know my cousin that kind that kind of cousin that I don't really like but I'll pray for him anyways and hope that the Lord changes him you know one of those yeah pray for the people maybe that you don't like you know that kid that picks on you at school and that always makes fun of you or something say Lord help him Lord show him that I'm not a bad person yeah and the Lord will listen to you and he'll say oh look he'll tell the angels look look at my child the first thing she does when she gets up in the morning that she prays he prays and it's not like a it's not like a funny thing it's for real the Lord will listen to you brother brandham tells us and the scripture says that if we pray to him he will listen your prayers won't fall on deaf years all right so remember that so mommies and daddies how would you feel if your kids woke up they ate the breakfast you made them they put on the clothes that you bought them they get in the car that you pay the bills for and you dropped them off at the school that you enroll them in and then you pick them up but they never say a word to you wow how would you feel mommies and daddies if you're like good night little girls and they're [Music] like good morning little boys and they're like and they never say a word to you little boys and girls would that be nice s's like no see prayer to Professor in the morning it helps it helps set the tone for the day exactly and what I mean by that is it it'll determine if you're going to be in a good mood or if you're going to be in a grouchy mood but the next thing we do you know we got to pray but then the next thing let's talk about hygiene a little bit right hygiene is how you take care of yourself so we have to go in and wash our face or take a shower depending on you know on on on on what we do and then we got to brush our teeth right really good until I think you need to repeat that one brush your teeth that's right brush our teeth and then brush your hair right and now with the same brush right it's a you don't want to do your toothbrush and then brush your hair with your toothbrush right cuz then it may get a little furry and you may not be able to use it again right I'm not going to preach brush your hair cuz then I'd be a hypocrite yes sir we'll have to take him to the barber shop I'm sure he knows a few Barbers so see you see the kids are right they're brushing their hair and they're combing their teeth but then there's the opposite Professor brushing their hair combing their teeth well the other way I'm sorry there's the opposite there's the opposite see can somebody tell me what he forgot to do Professor what do you think this guy right here the young man what did he forget to do with the white shirt yeah he forgot to pray look that's right he looks pretty mean right he need a hug and the young lady over there what do you think she forgot to do comb her hair and uh does that person brush their teeth we got to brush our teeth we got to take care because God gave us her teeth I think he she was brushing her hair and combing her teeth I think so I think so okay so remember there's the opposite right and if some if you're angry and you don't comb your hair and you have bad teeth you think people are going to like look at you and say that's a good citizen that's a Christian wow no you're going to attract attention for all the wrong reasons right okay so let's go to the next slide we'll we'll ask brother Christian if he can go to the next slide there you go so this remember this is just a so now we've prayed now we've done our hygiene now we go to the TA you know we go to the breakfast table and we have to eat good for our body and for our soul amen amen because our body is our Temple brother Mike oh did you guys know that one that your body is the Temple of the Lord amen so you got to take care of it you know I know brother Al with the older class today uh in Sunday school he was talking about the Holy Ghost the dove right is that right Judah he was talking about the Holy Ghost right and that Dove comes into the temple that Professor Theo is talking about but if the temple isn't ready to receive him is that Dove going to stay there or is it going to fly away fly away it'll fly away so we have to take care of our Temple so how do we do that well we got to pray for the food and eat breakfast right Professor yes sir and eat lots of good food healthy stuff mhm right we got to take it easy on the sugar cuz if not we'll be bouncing all over the house right or we're or if we go to school man they won't be able to control Us in school right the teacher will call home and say hey you got to tone the sugar down a little bit on the kids you like sugar Professor yes yeah the professor likes sugar right but my wife limits my sugar intake oh she makes me eat broccoli which is good for you so we pray for our food and remember after the food after so if our mom gives us healthy food and we like all that yummy stuff for breakfast but maybe there's you know maybe we want something else besides healthy food and we don't really like the healthy food and we don't get what we want but we've already prayed for it that food is blessed so you know when your mom goes into the other room you can't run to the trash can and throw away the food oh right no because the food's blessed and it's blessed by God and he gives it to you so why would we throw anything in the trash or not eat it we got to eat it all up trust me the stuff you don't like you begin to like as you're older for one reason or another okay all right so remember we're talking about the summer okay so now we've gotten up Professor we've prayed we've combed our hair we've done what we needed to do we've eaten breakfast maybe our mom asked us to do some chores or our daddy asks us to do some chores pick up your room put away your shoes you know feed the pet the dog the Goldfish the cat whatever you have do something around the house then maybe it's time to take a little time after breakfast and after your chores and read God's word just a little time putting God first right and this is good for all of us it's not just good for children as adults we need to do these things right we need to we need to prioritize I was talking with with our associate pastor in the back brother Johnny and we were talking about priorities you know that Professor we were talking about about how um God has to be our priority does everybody know what priority means yeah help us Professor do you guys children raise your hand if you don't know what priority means it's okay don't be shy it's okay okay well I'm going to say in thank priority means things in order of importance so things that are important what should be important for example is hitting your brother a priority no it's not is stealing your sister's cookies a priority no is brushing your teeth a priority okay but what is more of a priority brushing in your teeth or praying to Jesus ah so you got to put things in order of importance so when you wake up what's the most important thing pray Lord praying to the Lord and then the next important thing maybe you make your bed and then brush your teeth you could talk to your mommy and daddy and write a list of priorities for this summer yeah you know but the thing you shouldn't do is say oh Mom I didn't brush my teeth because I had to pray right because then you end up like uh the picture right over there so remember it isn't excuses because there's a lot of excuses we just have to have our priorities things in order so let's see let's see what else we have here Professor so after we read a little bit of God's word or we can sit down and say mommy can you tell me a little bit about God's word Daddy can you tell me a little bit about God's word or talk with your brother and sister and talk about maybe what you learned in Sunday school or something you heard in church it's good to talk about God's word because then we keep it as a priority in our lives and then we're focused on the wrong things you can have bad conversations Professor like so if I'm the professor's older brother and maybe I don't like to do things that are right and I don't want to talk about the Lord with them maybe I come to him and I say Professor my brother you know when Mom and Dad went home I turned on the TV and I watched that program I shouldn't have watched on the Disney Channel uhuh yeah man and I really like the way they were dancing oh now is that is that something that's going to bring me good things instead the professor would tell me brother Mike we just sit down and talk about how Jonah took a message of God to Nineveh he was swallowed by a whale was not yeah then God took him see for example you could talk about any story in the Bible or David the little kid how he beat up a Goliath giant oh yeah that big giant that was like 9 feet tall right see and then you can change you can change what you and your brother and your sister are talking about into a good conversation right and we're going to learn about that right now so after that we have to get some exercise exercise is good right how many like exercise right yeah that's right walking walking is good exercise yes it is you know cleaning your room is good exercise riding your bike lifting weights lifting weights not lifting the remote that's right we should really limit limit TV right TV not only don't they have good things to watch unfortunately but um it's not healthy to sit in front of the TV for hours and hours and hours and hours eating Cheetos yeah eating Cheetos or even video games I mean I know some video games are fun and then some of them are just not even appropriate appropriate means good yeah they're not good for you they do things to your to your mind right we want to keep our Temple ready for the little duve right the Holy Spirit the Holy Spirit the very life of God God's life in us doing the things that he did through US brother Jeff talked about This Little Light of Mine can you show us your light can I see your light give me oil in my lamp and you guys saw the drama too right where we need to keep refilling our lamps so it all plays good together I didn't say that it's you shouldn't watch any TV but you should really talk to your mommy and daddy about what is good for you to watch and what is not good for you to watch and watch the time you spend on video games because you could be out exercising you could be reading did you know that your mind is like a muscle Professor oh yeah and the more that you read the stronger it gets the stronger it gets yeah watching TV doesn't really exercise your mind I don't think so okay let's go to the next side brother Christian so again there's also another type of exercise professor and that's exercise in your spirit oh that sounds good can you read those for me Professor yes yes yes exercise your spirit number one testify about God's goodness in your life that's why we like to practice saying God is good and all the time yes I bet you if each one of you if if I ask each one of you which I want to stand and tell me about God's goodness in your life you would probably have more than 10 things to tell me each of you yeah sometimes we just do what is called take it for granted where they just oh things happen oh you know I have food I have shoes I have shelter I have this I have that and you're just like yeah I want more yeah I want more but we have to be thankful for what we have amen and take care of what we have right right what's the next one Professor confess to others what you believe oh but sometimes kids can be embarrassed cuz we don't know how they're going to make fun of us but did they make fun of Jesus Professor yes and why did Jesus do what he did Professor because he loved us that's right could you imagine that he suffered being innocent he suffered for you and for me mhm and he and he and he said that I have to do what I have have to do so we should confess it did you know that as we confess it Professor it gets easier and easier and easier amen do you know that when you meet people the first thing that you should do to to to tell them who you are is God bless you and that's like wow okay I felt chills you know people don't know how to sometimes people don't know how to react to that oh oh okay thank you but they know that something special about but or you can say hey bro what's up man what's shaking you know that's kind of like way back in time right but you guys get the picture who knows what you guys do in school now right Joseph Joseph what's up bro one thing that gives me strength is that the scripture says blessed are those that are made fun of for my name's sake remember that that's right scripture says that profess so you're blessed if they laugh at you or tease you cuz you're a Christian that just means you're blessed so instead instead of saying they making fun of me they want to know how come I have to wear this skirt why do I have to keep my hair so long like how come I don't cuss dad had to how no instead of thinking that they're all making fun of you you should say you know what they're making fun of me which means I'm blessed right that's right so they make fun you say h I'm blessed and you're not no and there's nothing don't say that and did you know did you know that we have something that's called freedom of speech here in the United States right and you can say whatever you want you could say I am a Christian amen and I believe in Jesus Christ and I love him right yes amen there's nothing wrong with that you know what it wasn't always like that for brother Mike oo yeah it wasn't always like that but now you know where I work every day I go there and everybody knows that I'm a Christian everybody knows the things that I do and the things that I don't do wow and everybody knows that I'm not perfect either right but when I sit down when I go to lunch with people they they they give me time so I can pray for my food and if I'm and if I'm there with other Christians Professor with maybe other Christians that don't come to church here we we'll all pray together for our food nice yeah so there's remember if you practice things while you're young it's going to be that much more easier as you get older and don't be embarrassed of it cuz that would be like being embarrassed of who you are that's right like you don't want to walk around like I hope nobody knows that I'm a boy I hope nobody knows that I'm Mexico I you don't want to be embarrassed of who you are just like you don't want to be embarrassed of being a Christian right so when you sit in the cafeteria at school no more doing this thank you Lord for my food amen just close your eyes and be like thank you Lord for this food and please don't let me get food poisoning Lord Lord thank you for making it blah blah blah aen am men you know what I mean that's right encourage others to do good professor exactly when you stand up and and you're proud of your beliefs and your faith in God that empowers other people to do the same and it encourages them so just by you being who you are Judah being a nice Christian Soldier you're empowering and giving other people strength to be the same could you imagine if I came over here to Judah and said hey Judah let's go outside and grab some rocks and throw them at Professor Theo spaceship and Judah said uh brother Mike uh you know you really shouldn't do that my spaceship gots Insurance you know well damaging other people's property can get you in trouble if Jud have told me that could you imagine that you can get in trouble brother Mike the police can come get you MH oh Jude I did thanks man I really appreciate you saving me man encourage others to do good in school when when others encourage you to do bad things you encourage them to do good no we're not supposed to disrespect the teacher because she's a teacher she is a figure of authority and she sacrifices to come and teach us and and it's a benefit to us it's a good to us so we should respect everybody right yeah see these are all different ways to exercise your spirit the spirit that God has given you right to be a to a healthy Christian right you want to be a healthy citizen you also want to be a healthy Christian what does Romans 10:9 say Romans 10:9 says that if you confess with your mouth Jesus as Lord and believe in your heart that God raised him from the dead you will be saved oh man so if I confess Jesus You're My Lord uh-huh I will be saved uh-huh oh man we should confess then let's do that right now let's do it Professor can anybody else want to confess that with us can you repeat after us we're going to say Jesus You're My Lord can we say that everybody together count of three 1 2 3es Jesus You're My Lord king of my heart and king of my heart heart amen now now it says all they have to do is believe in their heart that God raised him from the dead who believes that Jesus rose from the dead woohoo then we can be saved I'm going to say this for for for our folks that speak Spanish Professor okay praise the Lord amen what does Matthew 10:32 say professor Matthew 10:32 therefore everyone who confesses me before men I will also confess him before my my father who is in heaven amen I love that one so that means I if we tell people you know what I'm a Christian I love Jesus he's my Lord I'm going to follow him that when we get to heaven one day Jesus will tell his father you know what brother Mike stood for me on that day and he loved me and he was proud of me so I'm gonna stand for him brother Mike I love him can I go with Jesus now you can come wow it won't that be great or would you rather get father he he had the opportunity to confess me but he didn't confess me can I go with Jesus then oh which one would we choose right I choose to confess Jesus right mhm doesn't mean we have to be perfect oh we can't be perfect but that's what for amen you know there was a story about the Apostle Paul I've been talking to Bernie about this professor Paul and Silas and they were in prison and as they began to Worship in prison the spirit of the Lord came down and shook the prison and it shook the prison apart and the guard was so nervous because he thought they were going to get away and you know in those days the Centurion would have to pay with his life for those prisoners so the Centurion brother Braham says that he took out his sword and was going to commit suicide and Paul said harm yourself not for we are all here and and the Centurion said man there's something special about these two what's so special and it was so overwhelming that they said that the Centurion being an unbeliever asked them what must I do to be saved and Paul said believe in Jesus Christ all we have to do is believe amen confess him so do you guys got a good idea now of how to work with your parents to build yourself a summer schedule now so you're not just wasting time and we're going to share this I don't see my Sunday school class in here but we'll get them next week in Sunday school we'll share this with them okay and maybe I'll ask some of you that are here to come and share a little bit about what we learned today about what the scripture says okay can we actually get two volunteers to tell us what they learned today absolutely can they share Hannah you want to come little H come on up one of the boys come on up or another girl anybody it's okay you come this way shy can we give her a round of applause she's such a brave girl can you tell us what you learned Hana what I learned today is

not going to go through tough times because the word of God also tells us that we're going to have difficult times because God wants to see how we're going to react but he's always there with us Professor that's right that's right that's right he's with us next to us he's above us he's underneath us he's on our sides he's everywhere everywhere and he's always looking out for you yes so don't
