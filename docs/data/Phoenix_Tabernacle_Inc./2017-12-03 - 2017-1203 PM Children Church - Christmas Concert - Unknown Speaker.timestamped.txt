[59:50] greatest stories ever told
[59:53] and it's about our saviors birth it all
[59:57] started over 2,000 years ago when an
[1:00:03] angel came and told Mary she had found
[1:00:09] she had found grace in front of the Lord
[1:00:13] and that she would bear a son and his
[1:00:17] name would be Jesus
[1:00:20] now she believed and she had the had
[1:00:24] faith and as time passed and she was due
[1:00:27] to have the baby a decree went through
[1:00:31] all the land telling everyone to go back
[1:00:35] home to their native land
[1:00:38] so Joseph gathered his things and Mary
[1:00:42] got her things ready and they went down
[1:00:46] to Bethlehem and here they come Joseph
[1:00:51] and Mary arrived into Bethlehem saw how
[1:00:55] crowded it was full of people they were
[1:00:59] tired they have journeyed for so long
[1:01:02] and they wanted a place to rest
[1:01:05] so Joseph looked for the innkeeper and
[1:01:09] said innkeeper innkeeper we've traveled
[1:01:12] for so long do you have any room for us
[1:01:14] the innkeeper said no we don't so Joseph
[1:01:18] kept searching and he found another
[1:01:21] innkeeper innkeeper innkeeper do you
[1:01:23] have any room we've traveled for so long
[1:01:25] my wife is about to have a baby just one
[1:01:28] room and he said no then he kept
[1:01:31] searching and searching for another
[1:01:34] innkeeper and he said innkeeper

[1:01:46] innkeeper said sorry there's no room but
[1:01:49] I do have a barn you are more welcome to
[1:01:52] it and Joseph and Mary said okay and so
[1:01:57] they came and they entered the barn and
