[13:27] seated
[13:32] God bless
[13:36] you well tonight we have another
[13:39] installment in our series on on the book
[13:42] of Supernatural the life of William
[13:44] Branham the series of books we're in
[13:45] book two the young man in his
[13:47] desperation 1933 to
[13:50] 1946 we've now reached chapter
[13:52] 17 a hopeful marriage 1934 to 1935
[13:59] one thing we all have to remember is no
[14:01] matter how tough life's travails and
[14:04] troubles may get to us we have to
[14:07] remember God's Divine love overcomes
[14:10] all and when we have that Divine love
[14:12] inside of us for our fellow
[14:14] brother there's nothing that can stop
[14:17] God's
[14:18] word tonight's chapter demonstrates
[14:23] that Willam Mary and brandham married
[14:25] Amelia Hope brumbach on Friday June 27
[14:29] 1934 bill was 25 years old Hope was
[14:32] almost
[14:33] 21 they rented a little house at 434
[14:37] Graham Street not far from Brenham
[14:40] Tabernacle the place only had two rooms
[14:43] one side they used for both their living
[14:45] room and their bedroom the other side
[14:47] was a kitchen the house had no running
[14:50] water hope had to carry their water from
[14:52] a public faucet a block away overall it
[14:56] wasn't much of a house but for $4 a
[14:59] month it was the most they could afford
[15:02] the newly LEDs were starting their
[15:03] married life with very few assets Bill
[15:05] owned a wornout leather couch in his
[15:08] Ford Motorcar Bill's mother gave them a
[15:10] small iron bedstead someone gave them an
[15:13] old folding bed at a junkyard Bill
[15:16] bought a used cooking stove for
[15:19] 75 then he paid a $125 to get new grates
[15:23] to put in the stove hope went to work at
[15:25] F's shirt factory to help earn enough
[15:28] money to buy some more furniture soon
[15:31] they had saved enough to buy an
[15:33] unpainted breakfast set from Sears for
[15:36] $3.98 Bill painted the set yellow with a
[15:39] big green Shamrock on the table in the
[15:42] seat of each chair because Hope was
[15:44] always teasing him about being Irish the
[15:47] breakfast set improved their home
[15:49] considerably still the rigid wooden
[15:51] chairs were not made for relaxing bill
[15:54] would get so tired working two jobs in
[15:56] the daytime and tending to his pastoral
[15:58] responsibilities in the evenings he
[16:01] wished he could plop back into a cushion
[16:03] lounge chair at night prop up his feet
[16:05] and rest while he read his Bible with
[16:08] hope working Bill thought perhaps they
[16:10] could afford a comfortable piece of
[16:11] furniture together they drove across the
[16:14] river to Louisville to shop for a well
[16:16] padded club chair they found a Morris
[16:19] chair priced at only
[16:22] $16.98 that didn't seem Out Of Reach
[16:24] filled with the excitement that comes
[16:27] from a new experience Bill gave the
[16:29] store clerk $3 for the down payment and
[16:31] drove home with that beautiful green
[16:33] Morris chair they positioned it in a
[16:35] corner of his bedroom Bill sank back
[16:38] into its velvety soft Contours filling
[16:40] his lungs with the refreshing fragrance
[16:42] of new fabric he can think of only one
[16:45] word to describe it
[16:47] Heavenly that Morris chair was by far
[16:50] the biggest luxury Bill had yet owned
[16:52] after walking the high lines all day and
[16:54] preaching around town half the night the
[16:56] mois chair welcomed his tired muscles
[16:58] into its restful cushions over the next
[17:01] month Bill often fell asleep in his
[17:03] chair with his Bible lying open on his
[17:06] lap lovingly hope would urge him to get
[17:08] up so she could put him to bed his
[17:11] purchase soon created a problem Bill had
[17:14] not expected by the terms of the
[17:16] contract he was supposed to pay $1 a
[17:18] week on his debt it proved to be money
[17:21] that he badly needed elsewhere as the
[17:24] weeks went by the dollar a week payments
[17:26] did more and more damage to his
[17:28] precarious Budget on the seventh week
[17:31] Bill missed his first payment he just
[17:34] didn't have a dollar to spare then next
[17:36] week was no better when Bill missed his
[17:39] third payment in a row the finance
[17:41] company called Bill apologized with a
[17:44] heavy heart suggested they come take the
[17:46] chair back a few days later when bill
[17:49] came home from work the kitchen was
[17:50] filled with the smell of a freshly baked
[17:52] cherry pie his favored pie after supper
[17:56] he ate two pieces of pie smothered with
[17:58] hot sorg and molasses he kidded hope why
[18:01] are you being so good to me tonight she
[18:04] smiled as if she were hiding something
[18:07] bill I had the neighbor boy dig some
[18:09] worms this afternoon why don't we go
[18:11] down to the river and fish a little
[18:13] while that struck bill as odd because
[18:16] hope didn't care much for fishing first
[18:19] let's go in the other room and sit so I
[18:21] can let this cherry pie settle no Bill
[18:25] Let's Go Fishing right away her words
[18:27] sounded almost
[18:30] pleading honey what happened today hope
[18:33] said nothing but her eyes were moist
[18:37] Bill suspected the trouble so he said
[18:41] again let's go into the other room first
[18:44] when her face dropped Bill knew he was
[18:47] right he put his arm around her and
[18:50] together they walked through the doorway
[18:52] the Mo's chair was gone hope laid her
[18:55] head on Bill's chest and sobbed oh bill
[18:58] I tried to keep it for you I tried hard
[19:00] Bill squeezed her gently I know
[19:03] sweetheart it's not your fault we
[19:05] couldn't help it but one of these days
[19:07] things will be different someday God
[19:09] Will Make A Way and we'll have a nice
[19:11] chair she tilted her head so she could
[19:14] look into her husband's reassuring eyes
[19:16] I hope so Bill despite the inevitable
[19:19] hardships of poverty Bill and hope
[19:21] brandham were very happy together they
[19:23] treasured each other and their boundless
[19:25] love smoothed over the ditches and
[19:27] potholes in their Road
[19:29] in December of 1934 hope became pregnant
[19:32] they were both thrilled with the idea of
[19:34] having a baby because Bill's lineage was
[19:36] Irish and hopes was German he teased her
[19:39] by saying if it's a boy we're going to
[19:41] name him hindrik Michael hope gasp oh
[19:44] bill that sounds horrible on September
[19:46] 13th 1935 hope went into labor she had a
[19:50] difficult time and nearly died during
[19:52] the delivery Bill walked for Miles back
[19:55] and forth across the floor of the
[19:56] hospital waiting room at 3: :00 in the
[19:58] afternoon the baby cried at that same
[20:01] moment Bill shouted thank you Lord it is
[20:04] a boy and his name Shall be Called Billy
[20:07] Paul in a few minutes the doctor came
[20:09] out of the delivery room with a smile he
[20:11] said Reverend brandham I might charge
[20:14] you for this lenol and floor you've worn
[20:16] out but it would be worth it you've got
[20:19] a
[20:20] boy after Bill made certain his wife was
[20:22] all right he couldn't resist the joke
[20:25] honey I changed my mind I don't think we
[20:27] should name him h Michael since he was
[20:29] born on Friday the 13th I think we
[20:31] should name him
[20:33] Jinx she laughed but Bill I wanted to
[20:37] name him after his father then will'll
[20:41] name him after his father and also after
[20:44] the great Apostle St Paul we'll call him
[20:47] Billy
[20:48] Paul in October of 1935 the newspapers
[20:52] announced that musolini had invaded
[20:54] Ethiopia Ethiopia Italy with its Modern
[20:57] War Machine had rumbled into that
[20:59] backward country and had quickly crushed
[21:02] all Ethiopian resistance Europe
[21:04] expressed his outrage at this unexpected
[21:06] Invasion by immediately slapping
[21:08] economic sanctions on Italy Bill read
[21:11] the news with Keen interest he did not
[21:13] understand what strange Force allowed
[21:15] him to see into the future but whatever
[21:17] it was the events he always saw always
[21:21] happen he wondered again how such a gift
[21:24] could come from the devil like his
[21:26] Minister friends insisted he felt
[21:28] confused one Sunday after church Bill
[21:31] overheard Walt Johnson say you ought to
[21:34] have heard them Holy Rollers last night
[21:36] Bill stepped into the conversation what
[21:39] was that brother Walt Walt was chewing
[21:41] on a piece of dried orange peel for
[21:43] indigestion Pentecostals Billy you've
[21:46] never seen anything like it they were
[21:48] jumping up and down and rolling on the
[21:50] floor and they said that if you didn't
[21:52] jabber off in some kind of unknown
[21:54] language you weren't saved where's that
[21:57] at a tent meeting on the other side of
[21:59] Louisville the group calls themselves
[22:01] the House of David and they're calling
[22:03] these meetings the school of the
[22:04] prophets colored people of course oh
[22:07] that explains it said Bill knowing how
[22:09] fanatically some colored people Express
[22:11] their
[22:12] religion there were a lot of white
[22:14] people there too really did they do that
[22:17] too yes they did it too that's funny and
[22:21] people get mixed up in stuff like that
[22:23] bill shook his head well I guess we're
[22:26] bound to get to those things the report
[22:29] sparked Bill's curiosity and Monday
[22:31] night he drove across the river to
[22:32] Louisville to check it out although he
[22:34] didn't see anyone rolling on the floor
[22:36] the crowd was certainly excited about
[22:38] something and they did seem to have some
[22:40] strange doctrines during the service and
[22:43] unusual middle-aged man stood up to
[22:45] testify he reminded bill of an Old
[22:48] Testament Prophet with graying hair down
[22:50] to his shoulders and a curly beard that
[22:52] tumbled down over his chest his
[22:54] testimony was as striking as his
[22:56] appearance he introduced uced himself as
[22:58] John Ryan from daak Michigan he said the
[23:02] Lord had told him to come down to
[23:04] Louisville Kentucky to testify at that
[23:06] meeting he spoke about the power of God
[23:08] the fire of Pentecost and the baptism of
[23:10] the Holy Spirit his testimony carried
[23:13] such energy and conviction that bill
[23:15] decided he wanted to meet this peculiar
[23:17] man they talked for a long time after
[23:19] church John Ryan said that as a young
[23:23] man he was an acrobat in a circus for
[23:25] years he had belonged to the Catholic
[23:26] church but after he gave his heart to
[23:29] Jesus Christ he became a Pentecostal and
[23:32] now he traveled as the Lord led him
[23:34] testifying about the power of God
[23:36] wherever he went Bill told him about the
[23:39] seven-part vision he had seen in June of
[23:41] 1933 when John Ryan learned that one of
[23:44] the parts foresaw melini's invasion of
[23:46] Ethiopia Ryan could scarcely contain his
[23:49] enthusiasm and ask if they could talk
[23:51] more about it later that was fine with
[23:53] Bill so he invited the older man home to
[23:55] spend the night in the morning they sat
[23:58] for a long time around the kitchen table
[23:59] while Bill shared some of his uncanny
[24:01] experiences he felt more freedom talking
[24:03] to this Stranger than he did talking to
[24:05] ministers whom he had known for years
[24:07] John Ryan encouraged bill to pay close
[24:09] attention to the Visions suggesting that
[24:12] they might be the voice of God speaking
[24:14] to him then he talked about something he
[24:17] called the Pentecostal experience which
[24:20] he said was the power of God as a
[24:23] dynamic living force in a Christian's
[24:25] life Bill couldn't grasp his meaning the
[24:28] man used unfamiliar terms like baptism
[24:31] of the Holy Ghost speaking in tongues
[24:33] and interpretation of tongues but one
[24:36] thing was clear John Ryan definitely
[24:38] believed in what he was saying he grew
[24:40] animated as he talked suddenly he threw
[24:44] up his hands and began to speak in some
[24:46] kind of gibberish language after a
[24:48] minute he stopped then he walked around
[24:50] the table laid his hand on Bill's
[24:52] shoulder and said brother Billy this is
[24:55] the
[24:56] interpretation you're just a lad now
[24:59] there's a lot of Youth to you yet but
[25:01] someday that will settle down and
[25:04] almighty God will use you to stir the
[25:07] Nations God bless
[25:10] [Applause]

[54:39] this can you show me how to lift up your
[54:44] hands well that's how a lot of us lift
[54:46] our
[54:47] hands but can can someone actually show
[54:49] me how to lift up our
[54:52] hands boys one more time let's lift our
[54:54] hands like this
[54:57] yeah boys representing give the boys a
[54:59] round of
[55:03] applause why do we lift up our
[55:06] hands does anybody
[55:10] know to smell what kind of deodorant we
[55:13] have
[55:16] on to scratch our heads when we have a
[55:21] itch to touch the
[55:24] roof
[55:26] why do we lift up our
[55:27] hands raise your hands if you think you
[55:30] know Benji why do we lift up our
[55:34] hands
[55:36] uh to praise God to praise
[55:39] God a great answer did you know that
[55:44] sorry I'll slow down I'll slow down
[55:46] pinch me buddy pinch me if I'm going too
[55:48] fast did you know that when you're in a
[55:51] war and the enemy is surrounding you
[55:56] if you don't want to
[55:58] die you could raise up your hands and
[56:00] say I
[56:02] surrender I Surrender don't
[56:06] shoot did you know you can do
[56:09] that so A lot of times we fight
[56:14] God and we make our heart really
[56:18] hard and we don't let God have his way
[56:22] in
[56:23] US so we're in the battle with
[56:28] god I don't want to listen to you God no
[56:31] no I don't want to worship you right now
[56:34] God but God is trying to fight through
[56:36] you to help
[56:40] you so when you lift up your
[56:44] hands you're saying I Surrender
[56:48] God you can have your way in
[56:51] me do we
[56:53] understand there's another example and a
[56:56] reason why we lift up our
[56:59] hands did you know that one time
[57:04] Moses was with the children of Israel in
[57:07] the
[57:09] desert and the enemy came and attacked
[57:15] them can you come be Moses for me
[57:19] Daniel where's chicken and and um and
[57:22] Mikey so pretend you guys right there
[57:25] are the enemy and the children of Israel
[57:27] and you're
[57:28] fighting and there a
[57:32] war with the children of
[57:35] Israel and all of a
[57:37] sudden we have Moses
[57:40] here with two of his
[57:42] friends and Moses raised up his
[57:46] hands and as long as Moses's hands were
[57:52] raised the children of Israel were
[57:57] winning but if Moses said I'm tired and
[57:59] he started putting his hands
[58:04] down oh Benji
[58:06] died oh oh the the children of Israel
[58:09] are getting
[58:11] hurt they're
[58:14] losing the enemy just gave him a
[58:19] wedgie
[58:20] No Moses what are you
[58:23] doing hands up
[58:26] then all of a sudden they got
[58:29] superpowers and then God came
[58:33] down and they started winning
[58:37] again but then Moses got super
[58:41] tired he said I'm an old
[58:45] man I can't lift up my hands like that I
[58:48] can't lift up my hands like that and
[58:50] they started losing
[58:52] again so then these guys had to hold up
[58:55] his
[58:58] hands and as long as Moses's hands were
[59:05] lifted the children got the
[59:10] victory can you believe
[59:12] that look at the
[59:15] picture poor little
[59:17] Moses had to lift up his hands like this
[59:19] with people holding
[59:22] it thank you can you give them a round
[59:24] of applause
[59:27] so what does that tell
[59:29] us what am I trying to say Can somebody
[59:31] come and tell
[59:35] [Music]
[59:38] me what did he
[59:40] say he said to lift up your hands and to
[59:45] sing round
[59:46] ofuse thank you
[59:48] Abraham but why do we lift up our
[59:53] hands because if our hands are
[59:57] lifted the enemy cannot beat
[1:00:02] us as long as our hands are lifted to
[1:00:06] God you'll give us the
[1:00:10] power to
[1:00:13] overcome with my hands lifted
[1:00:18] up and my heart full of
[1:00:23] Praise oh oh with a Heart of
[1:00:27] Thanksgiving I Will Bless thee oh Lord I
[1:00:30] Will Bless thee Oh Lord with my hands
[1:00:33] lifted up and my mouth full of Praise

[1:00:40] me and my mouth full of Praise amen with
[1:00:45] my heart with My Heart of

[1:00:55] weak I'm losing I'm Lo with my hands it

[1:01:03] and my mouth full of Praise thank you
[1:01:06] with a heart with a heart of
[1:01:10] [Music]
[1:01:12] thanksgiv I Will Bless thee Oh Lord Give
[1:01:16] the Lord a round of
[1:01:17] applause that's why we lift up our hands
[1:01:22] amen go to the next slide please
[1:01:25] and just in case you don't believe me
[1:01:27] I'm going to read it for
[1:01:31] you so it came about when Moses held his
[1:01:35] hands up that Israel prevailed and when
[1:01:38] he let his hands down the amalec
[1:01:50] prevailed but Moses's hands were heavy
[1:01:53] then they took a stone and put it under
[1:01:56] him and he sat on it and Aaron and her
[1:01:59] supported his hands one on one side one
[1:02:03] on the other thus his hands were steady
[1:02:07] until the
[1:02:23] sunset
[1:02:30] amen so I said it and you might not have
[1:02:32] believed me but now that the word says
[1:02:34] it can we say Amen to the

[1:04:35] not talking about Iron Man okay or
[1:04:38] Captain America The Avengers are the
[1:04:40] enemies of God they want to avenge him
[1:04:43] so I'm going to see that again cuz wow
[1:04:45] wow wow through the Praises of children
[1:04:47] and infants who's a child here where are
[1:04:51] the infants see adanah and Gideon my
[1:04:54] Sons they're 1 and 2 years old they're
[1:04:57] babies and they're around the house and
[1:04:59] all of a sudden you'll hear Gideon
[1:05:01] go like what is he doing and I realized
[1:05:04] he's singing cuz adanah is singing power
[1:05:07] in the name of Jesus your power I'm like
[1:05:11] this little kid two years old praising

[1:05:19] melts my heart through the Praises of

[1:05:24] established a stronghold against your
