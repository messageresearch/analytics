privilege and an honor for me to be able to share with you the next reading in our series of sequential excerpts from the series of books supernatural life of William Branham we're in book three the men of his Commission 1946 to 1950 by Owen Jorgensen it's been a while since I read the last part of this so they kind of catch you up on what had happened to this point before we get started brother Branham was in Jonesboro Arkansas 1946 was the year the chapter is 33 a prayer line 8 days long he was in approaching the font what would be the final afternoon of the eighth day of this prayer campaign in Jonesboro Arkansas he had not seen system ADA for quite some time she took a train to Jonesboro he got word at the church that she had arrived so several brothers accompanied brother Brandon to go pick up made up and so when we pick up the chapter we'll start before we start however I do have several comments I'd like to make that are very important I think for all of us to realize we serve a God that is no respecter of persons and what that really means many people misinterpret that what that means is he doesn't see skin color he doesn't see our religion our politics he doesn't see our hair color our nationality but he does see our heart and we're so thankful for that I believe this particular part of this chapter the last six pages were going to finish tonight is evidence event a gang of Usher's met them assisting them through the jostling crowd and into the building just inside the door bill noticed a man waving a blue cap to catch his attention bill moved close enough to ask are you calling to me sir the man clenched his hat nervously aren't you brother branham he asked yes I am but I shouldn't pray for anyone out here or I'll calls a Rutgers if you can get in the prayer line out oh I'm not seeking prayer for myself the man explained I'm an ambulance driver today I brought an elderly patient down from Missouri very ill she's dying out there in my ambulance I think she may may already be dead I can't find a doctor anywhere and I don't know what to do could you come to her sir they wouldn't take my word to pronounce her dead you need to call an undertaker the driver pressed him I wish you would come with me her husband is frantic and maybe you could quiet him down bill knew where the ambulance was parked the traffic police had designated a certain area exclusively for ambulances I don't think I could even get to the woman there must be 2,000 people between us in those ambulances we'll help you offered one of the four Usher's so bill agreed to go which with much apologetic pushing in a great deal difficulty they finally reached the row of ambulances parked against a curb the four uh sure stayed outside while bill and the driver opened the door and climbed into the ambulance there an old man knelt over a limp body of a wrinkled woman the man's shirt was patched his overalls were faded his socks showed through the soles of his shoes a week's growth of beard covered his tired face he sent hunched over moving his head slightly back and forth sobbing Oh mother mother why did you leave me the way the man clenched his tattered straw hat reminded Bill of his own dad what's the matter sir the old man looked up are you the doctor no I'm brother branham old brother branham poor mother he looked back down to the motionless woman on the cot I've lost her I'm sure she quit breathing awhile ago she wanted to see you so bad before she died she was such a good wife to me she raised my children and hoed those fields beside me and helped me every step of the way she got cancer in her organs a few years ago we took her to st. Louis so the doctors could operate on her but it didn't do no good she kept getting worse he looked back at bill and his voice betrayed his bitter disappointment this morning we were listening to the radio and we heard a man testified that he had been blind for 10 years and that after you pray for him he could see I thought maybe a miracle can happen like that for us we didn't have any money left because I spent all my savings on the operation but I sold some quilts she had made and some blackberries she had canned and I hired this ambulance to bring her to Jonesboro he looked sadly back down at his wife now she's dead and I don't know what I'm going to do without her I'll be so lonesome as comfortingly as he could bill said well Dan the only thing I can do for you is all for prayer bill didn't know if the woman was dead or not she certainly looked in the ambulance driver had taken her false teeth out of her lips at something way back she had what looked like muddy water in her eyes her forehead felt cold and sticky to Bill's touch he took her right hand in his left and felt for her pulse he could not find it and as further proof that she must be dead Bill's left hand cannot detect any vibrations from the cancer bowing his head bill calmly said dear Lord Jesus I pray you'll be merciful to this brother help him and bless him into this woman who came all the way believing that he thought he felt a woman squeeze his hand opening his eyes he studied her closely she looked like a corpse it must have been his imagination or perhaps the twitching of the dead woman's muscles bill closed his eyes and continuing his prayer but a few moments later he felt her squeeze his hand again this time he knew it was for life he opened his eyes and studied her face the skin on her forehead wrinkled she opened her eyes and looked up in him bill didn't say a word the old man still had his eyes shut wringing his hands his head pointed up toward the ceiling the woman raised her head slightly and said to bill what's your name I'm brother branham the old man jerked his head around and cried in astonishment mother then he drew his arms around her and blood with joy mother mother as the color returned to the woman's cheeks billed noted that his left hand could still not detect any vibrations of cancer in her body that meant the disease was gone the old man's shouting had attracted the attention of some of the people outside the ambulance who were now pressing their faces to the glass the driver said to bill I think they figured out who you are you're gonna have trouble getting back in the building bill knew the driver was right he had been safe enough coming here because these people had never seen him before but most of them had been waiting days to get inside for prayer as soon as they knew he was in their midst the news would spread like wind driven fire and he would have a very difficult time getting back inside the auditorium an idea popped into his mind he said to the driver if you'll stand back with your back to that window and slowly take off your coat that will hide the inside of this ambulance just long enough for me to slip out of this other door if I can get away from here without being seen then I'll be all right nobody knows me outside I can move along the edge of the crowd to the back parking lot you'll have to tell the ushers to meet me back there I don't think I can get through the crowd and into the auditorium without her help I'll tell them said the driver he turned his back to the window so that had several faces pressed against it then he stretched slowly slipping his arm out of his coat effectively covering the little windows get going he said bill slipped quietly out the far side and hurried down the line of am useless too he reached the back parking lot electric floodlights illuminated the drizzle of rain that fell on the heads of several thousand men women and children who were crowding around the back doors of the auditorium bill felt completely anonymous since no one here had ever seen him before so rather than wait for the ushers to help him bill tried to make his way through the crowd by himself a husky voice said sharply quit pushing pardon me CID bill and kept trying to push his way forward a large rough-looking man turned around to face him I said quit pushing he growled yes sir bill said sheepishly excuse me backing up to the fringe of the crowd he wondered what he should do the ushers were nowhere in sight he heard a female voice hollering daddy daddy bill looked for the source of the crying saw a young colored girl about 17 years old pushing her way through a mass of white people she was obviously blind her eyes were white with cataracts even so because of the Jim Crow walls that segregated whites from blacks nobody nearby was willing to help her the girl groped her way through the crowd and Bill's general direction bill moved through the fringe of the crowd until he was directly in the girl's path soon she bumped into him excuse me she said but I'm blind enough lost my daddy could you help me find the bus from Memphis bill looked at the long road buses that were lined up at one end of the parking lot yes I can help you he said what are you doing here my daddy and I came to see the healer she replied how did you hear about him this morning I was listening to the radio and they had one man get on there and tell about how for years he couldn't speak a word and now he can talk another man said he had been drawing the blind pension for 12 years and now he could see so good he could read his Bible that gave me hope again for my sight when I was a little girl I got these cataracts on my eyes the doctor told me when I got older he could take them off but now that I'm older he says they've done wrapped around the optic nerves and he can't touch them so I don't have a chance unless I can get to the healer but tonight is the last night he'll be here and my and my daddy and I couldn't even get near the building now I've lost my daddy and I can't even get back to the bus kind sir would you please help me yes ma'am I will but first I'd like to question you about this he or you're talking about do you believe that God would send an angel and heal people today yes sir I do you mean you believe and even though we have so many fine doctors and hospitals around bill felt a little ashamed of himself for taking advantage of her blindness this way but he wanted to test her faith she quickly responded none of these doctors can help me sir if you'll take me by the hand and lead me to the healer then I can find daddy by myself bill could not keep up his pretense any longer sister maybe I'm the one you're supposed to see she grabbed the lapel of his coat and held on to it like a vise is you the he where she demanded no ma'am I'm brother branham the preacher Jesus Christ is the healer now if you'll take your hands off my coat and he took hold of her wrists to pull them away the girl held on with all her strength she had him and she wasn't gonna let him get away have mercy on me brother branham she begged sister would you let me hold your hand while I pray bill succeeded in prying one of the girls hands loose he felt the vibrations from the cataracts moving up his arm as he prayed dear Jesus one day you carried that old rugged cross bumping along the street blood running down your shoulders your little frail bodies staggering under the load a colored man by the name of Simon of Cyrene came up beside you picked up the cross and helped you bear it and now one of Simon's children is staggering here in the darkness I'm sure you understand the girl shuddered something just went through me she said her body quivering my eyes filled so cold bill felt the vibrations in his arm subsiding the demonic life had just gone out of the cataracts sister shut your eyelids for a moment that's it the cataracts are shrinking in a few moments you should be able to see don't say anything about it or I'll be recognised I don't want people to know I'm here now slowly open your eyes Jesus has given you your sight back her eyelids fluttered open she looked up in gasp is them lights yes can you count him there's four then people going by before bill can answer she screamed at the top of her voice faces turned her way she screamed again praise God I can see I can see I was blind and now I see people began moving towards bill and the girl just then the group of Usher's came around a corner of the building spotted bill and rushed to his rescue before the ushers hustled him away a man with a twisted leg who was leaning on a club cried out I know your brother branham have mercy on me sir I've been standing here for eight days I've got five children at home and I'm crippled I believe you're a good boy if you ask God for me he'll do it bill said in the name of Jesus Christ give me your club without hesitation the crippled man handed bill his homemade cane instantly his twisted leg straightened and supported him slapping his shoe on the asphalt the man shouted I'm healed I'm healed excitedly the crowd pressed forward the four Usher's shielding build the best they could force their way back to the auditorium while the people that were near strained just the touch Bill's clothes as he passed it did not matter them that his suit was patched and mended there is a footnote here that the author put at the very end of this chapter I'd like to share it with you years later bill met this woman again she was working as a waitress and told him she had never had any more trouble with her eyes since the day of her healing in 1946 in Jonesboro Arkansas god bless you [Applause] [Music] God blue god bless

service amen let us bow our heads having the father Lord Jesus we come before you this evening father thankful Lord for permitting us to be here in children's church Lord we ask father God that you just let us express a little bit about your word to the children father God we're gonna be talking a little bit about the ministry of our Lord Jesus Christ and some of the things that he did father while he was here on earth and we're so grateful for that Lord we just ask that you bless it father and that you reveal it to us father God and it may be a blessing for the children and all that are here tonight father God we thank you Father because you are so good and loving and kind to his father God and we just want to tell you that we love you Father and that we appreciate you Lord and we just surrender our hearts to you this evening father God we thank you Lord and we ask you for the blessing of this word in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ amen amen you may be seated for now god bless you we're gonna get started and one of the as you know one of the things we want to do is we want to illustrate the things that our Lord Jesus Christ did he you know did while he was here on earth to learn from it right to see how all of us as children of the Lord can learn from it and the last time we were here two weeks ago we learned about the Good Samaritan amen and we saw how on his way to Jericho he had gotten you know he had gotten beat up on the way to Jericho right young men you remember that right and how he thought that when he saw a priest from his people that he was going to get help and the guy just crossed the street and went the other way and then we saw the Levite and the same thing he crossed the street and went the other way and left him there and when he saw the Samaritan you know it wasn't back then it wasn't a custom meaning that Samaritans and Jews did not really have a lot of fellowship together they weren't friends or things of that nature and the last person that he thought was going to help him is the person that helped them and we learned a lesson about that right that we should always love our neighbor as ourselves right because that is what Jesus was telling when he told the parable of the Good Samaritan he said you know go go and do this and you will have eternal life amen so today we want to talk a little bit about Jesus and the children right so how many children here knows that Jesus loves the little children do you know that let me see your hands nice nice and high does Jesus love the little children amen so what we're gonna do is we're gonna we're gonna find out because we're gonna ask Jesus right we're gonna ask Jesus to come here and and and show us a little bit about him right and about the story in the Bible which is found in Matthew 19 which talks about that right so as the story goes Jesus Jesus was on the road Jesus was always on the road right he was going from town to town in those days bringing the Word of God doing different things right and we know that they were always challenging him right and while he was answering the questions that were always being asked of him he was also teaching the disciples right so one day Jesus was coming in into town with the disciples right [Music] make where the scientists we make with Messiah going messiahs comes weights you know you know the disciples were a little bit of rough around the edges some of them right some of them were fishermen and you know workers and so what I'm gonna ask what I'm gonna ask is if Jesus would come back here hey Jesus how you doing god bless you so his disciples look pretty mean especially this one in the blue right pretty mean I think that's Peter they're right Peter Peter was pretty rough amen so what I'm gonna ask is if the is there is there some parents that want to help us so we can illustrate just how Jesus loved the children okay let's see children then do me a favor come here children I'm gonna ask my boys from Sunday school to come help me out come here guys come here don't be shy come here just release you come up okay perfect coming up meow so the children so the children saw Jesus right the children saw Jesus and they wanted to go to him but what happened what did Jesus do Peter knock up excuse me that the little kids come to me for this is how the kingdom of God is let me tell you unless you can come to me like these little children you won't even see the kingdom of God come on come over here bring them so I could touch them and bless them it'll get Ian see I don't know guys I need you guys to understand unless you can come like a little kid you can't even see you can't even understand the kingdom of God because in these little kids there's want to come with me too ah look with this balloon and everything he has 100% faith in his daddy his daddy could just throw him up and he knows that his daddy will catch him he's not scared we have to come to God that way you have to trust God just like these little children with no guile in you no wickedness no evilness being able to forgive these little kids fight 2 seconds later they're best friends but all these adults start fighting spend years not talking to each other but nothing will enter in but perfect love Wow see Jesus Jesus was so amazing that he was not only teaching the disciples but he was also teaching the children so children Jesus wants you to come to him he wants you to read about him in his word he wants you to pray to him he wants you to talk to him like your best friend and he's gonna watch out for you and take care of you so when we're young when we're young like these kids and these children we need to seek Jesus and remember as as we start to grow we have to understand that we have to be like children right yeah it's just like he said right so wow that's amazing right did everybody know that you know that we have to be like these little children it's very simple so sometimes let me ask let me ask you guys a question do you believe that Jesus can do anything yes see they don't even think twice about it but sometimes as adults they ask us that question and we start thinking about our problems and we're like I don't know if he can do it he can do everything because what is impossible for man Peter is where Jesus works every day and he makes things come to pass amen okay children you can be seated thank you sister thank you very much Amen let's give them an applause so we're just gonna we're gonna ask Jesus to come back here I gotta talk to these guys about and take a seat and come and come and talk to the disciples your beautiful kids but that's why when the that's why when the babies are babies we also bring them in to be presented in the house of the Lord did you know that we present them to Jesus right because Jesus doesn't want us to keep the children away from him he wants us to bring them he wants us to bring them to children's church like all you parents brought your children to children's church so they can learn about the goodness of God now as we start getting older did you know that Jesus begins to give us a choice did you guys know that see when we're young what are we supposed to do we're supposed to learn about God like all of you and we're also supposed to follow what what do we follow when we're young can somebody tell me one of my Sunday school students what what is something that Moses brought that we're supposed to follow when we're young yes sir that 10 commandments let's give them an applause we're supposed to follow the commandments amen see and surely so surely after Jesus taught the disciples can go through the door brother shortly after Jesus taught the disciples about the little children there was also another young man a rich young dignitary okay and we're gonna learn a little bit about the choice that he was faced with but and then we're gonna talk a little bit about the choice that all of you have we're gonna have one day so let's let's let's watch that unfold a little bit right good master master what must I do to inherit eternal life why do you call me good there's nobody good but God but concerning eternal life well we've all heard of the commandments have you kept the commandments you just keep the commandments yes you do not murder you know do not steal do not commit adultery don't lie about your brother I don't have any gods before you honor your father and your mother you know and love your neighbor as yourself yes what then do I lack what else do I need well you've done all this but there's one more thing all your beautiful possessions you sell all that you have and give it to the poor and you'll have eternal life and then come follow me you can put it on offer up so easy now did I tell you guys the truth it's very hard for a rich man to be saved in fact it's easier for a rich man for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for a rich man to be saved how anybody be saved that's a good question but you know what what is impossible for man with God all things are possible I tell you the truth anybody that would forsake their homes their riches their children their mothers their fathers their land their dreams you would forsake all of that take the word apply it to your life and follow me then those will be with me and have treasures in heaven but Jesus what about all his good works that he did he fed the poor he helped the widow he did all these good things is any of that gonna help him it's good to be a good person it's good to have all those works but those good works those good works for the mic don't ever save us they'll never save us and we're gonna be tempted in all things now let me just tell you something the Bible says that Jesus was tempted in all things everything so he could relate I could relate to you right now I just got a thought man this young man could he could fund my ministry I could have had chariots and all kinds of stuff with his riches he was right there he wanted to follow and serve me but he couldn't give that stuff up I could have had a great big ship and horses and my own temple to preach from but now that was a temptation brother Mike because it's easy if somebody is willing to give you the money to take it but sometimes that's not always God's Way so I tell you it doesn't matter the works that you do what matters is if you can apply this word to your heart and live it 100% see the Apostle Paul taught us that we are saved we have to accept the sacrifice who is Jesus Christ so one of the things that we're gonna face children is that one day you're gonna have the choice to accept Jesus as your Savior like this rich young ruler did see some of us may not be rich with possessions maybe we're rich with other things with things that we love that we put before God maybe we like to watch TV maybe we like to play maybe we like to do all of these things and we don't make time for God but one day we're gonna have to make a choice and make our priorities different and all a priority means children is what we purse what we excuse me what we put first in our lives and remember the commandments say that thou shalt not have any other gods before me and when we worship things on this earth whether it be basketball players video games being with our friends texting with our friends or whatever it is that we're doing and we put that before God we're not following him we're doing exactly what the rich young ruler did and all Jesus wanted him to do was to follow him and he would have had ten times ten times those rewards in heaven plus eternal life so it's something that we're gonna have to consider the Gospels Matthew Mark Luke and John all tell the story we need to read it and understand it because that question there's a lot of us that are already facing that question today some of my younger some of my older children right from children's church will we follow Christ or we or will we do what we want kind of like that rich young ruler and it's really and its really disciples really it's it's it's really a question we all face as adults right so to follow Jesus so Jesus let me just ask one more question so you saying that I have to be poor on earth is that what you're saying you don't have to be poor to enter into the kingdom of heaven but you have to cherish more than anything the riches that are in that word of God Jesus I'm the lawyer in the group how do we stay humble when we gain more wealth how do we maintain our humility or her humbleness well we have to understand that every good gift comes from the father so anything that you have how can you boast about something that didn't come from you in the beginning so the more you get the humbler you should be knowing that every good thing comes from God and the humble ooh you are the more he wants to give you because he knows that the Jesus so if I'm a so if I'm a child and my parents buy me things does that mean I shouldn't make fun of people and tell them that I have more than them and that my and that my stuff is better than them you wouldn't brag about what you have cuz you know mom and daddy don't have to get you anything they buy you things because they love you I think all of us as parents we want to buy our kids everything that we didn't have right but in turn as children what should we do Jesus thankful should we pray for our parents absolutely a family that prays together stays together so pray for your parents but also pray with your parents that would be awesome and don't forget to always be grateful for what you have be grateful be grateful be grateful be grateful give thanks with a grateful heart Jesus if I if if if me and my little brothers and my little sisters if we follow you and we fall and we make a mistake will you wait for us and help us absolutely you know the difference between a sinner and a saint is that the sinner will fall and he'll stay down there I might as well just stay here I'm good for nothing I mess up anyways but the same the righteous man falls seven times but he gets up eight times so it doesn't matter how you start the race doesn't matter the middle of the race what matters is how you finish the race I'll always be there I never promised that the road will be easy but I promise that I'll be there wow that's that's pretty awesome right does anybody I'm gonna ask the children do you have any questions for Jesus about what you've learned today no we're all we all so let's go back and review so one of the things that we learned is that Jesus loves the children is that right and he wants to bless them is that right so so how would parents today present their kids to Jesus like they did back then I know what we need to do is we need to pray with our children right right Jesus as parents it says wherever two or three are gathered in my name I will be there right so if we if we sit down with our kids and pray you'll come and you'll blessa absolutely so we've we've learned that right it's very simple right it's almost too simple Jesus right but Jesus blesses the children and we are all his children because that's what we learned today it's so simple that it'll dumbfound the wise and the prudent but my little children will understand it and you guys will grab it so we also learned that we have a choice to make that if we follow the commandments as young people and then we become accountable or responsible and we grow up and now we know the difference between right and wrong Jesus is offering us to come follow him in and have eternal life and forgive us of all of the mistakes that we've made amen right so we're gonna have to think about that and talk about it with your parents say mom dad you know I've been thinking about it how is it that I must follow Jesus because Jesus clearly gave your parents and get salvation is for you yeah there's a way to do it there's no reason there's no reason there's no reason that we should be concerned we need to believe like little children right and remember last time we were here we learned about the Good Samaritan Jesus told us about the Good Samaritan and we have to love each other right we have to love each other and what hurts me should hurt Jesus should hurt my brother disciples and what hurts you should hurt me we should care about each other and pray about each other you know I was I was learning about your prophet the other day Jesus brother branham and I can't remember because I was I was looking for something specific but I came across something that he said and one of the things that he said he said we should never say anything bad about anybody he said we should look for what's good and encourage them with that the Bible tells us that Wow if you even call your brother a fool you're in danger of hell's fire so I want to love you know Jesus when I first came to - to - to the camp in Sacramento that our pastor invited us for the greatest thing that I was attracted to as a child was the love that the people showed for one another which was the love that you are teaching us how to do right it's what I told my disciples the people will know who you are by your love for one another not by the car you drive or the church you go to or how hard you pray or your gift of healing or discernment your love for one another so I've been me I've been meaning to ask you something because somebody said about the impossible is the impossible really possible with you with God all things are possible for the mic I mean come on you're saved you're proof that all things are impossible oh that's right I was very sick last year you guys remember in April I got very sick and he was with me brother and man you talked about this morning and his testimony a lot of us have testimonies about that right and anything so what how would you encourage the children to - to go after their dream in the right order Jesus so the first thing I would encourage you guys so you can achieve your dreams I encourage you to give me your dreams to give me your heart and I'll put it inside you a new heart with new desires and I'll bring those to pass see sometimes we have our own dreams or our own desires and we think oh I'm gonna be a Christian or now that I'm a Christian I'm serving you God now you got to give me this car or now you gotta give me this house I'm serving you Lord now can you give me this Xbox that I really really wanted cuz I prayed for it see those are still your desires see your thoughts are not my thoughts so if you want success in your life give me your heart I'll trade you I'll give you a brand new heart and put my desires in your heart so that when you wake up in the morning you have new desires that I'll be more happy than to give you fill you with love I'll fill you with peace I'll fill you with joy and in the midst of the storm you can say he is my dream he is my peace wow that's awesome man you know as we learn more and more about Jesus I think over the next couple of weeks it's really beginning to paint a picture of what we all have man it's truly is awesome we are truly blessed right and I just want to thank the Lord amen do you are you thankful to the Lord and and if we can stay humble the word tells us he who hums little humbles himself God will exalt him so don't brag don't push everybody around so I'm the best if you could stay humble and give God all the glory don't worry I'll see you that our Father in heaven will see you and he'll exalt you but he who exalts himself will be humbled like the rich man he just came with all his his camels and his chariots and his gold and even my disciples were like wow I know they let him in pretty fast he did and anyone let the children stop the little guys in but when they saw this guy was rolling in dough they thought he must be important but he sure walked away humble didn't he but if we humble ourselves and stay low God will lift us up wow that's awesome that's that truly is awesome Jesus Oh Paul how can you explain to I mean Peter what the rich young ruler rejected oh wow you can't even imagine I think my borrower prophet brother Branham says that his wife when she went beyond the curtain of time she was there in heaven and she said Billy you preached about it but you have no idea what it's like over there you can't even imagine what it is like over there in heaven but I will tell you this you keep on reading later on it tells you where he ended up talks about the rich man in torment I want to share that for the mic yeah it does it definitely does it talks about Lazarus and the Richmond and it says that there was a great space between them right and that the rich man asked father Abraham to let Lazarus dip his finger in water and put it on his tongue because the place where he was that was so hot but he was this close to me I touched him I talked to him and he turned away and when he couldn't do it he begged to let him go tell his family about where he was and it was not good it was impossible but Jesus did you still love him absolutely absolutely I loved him that's why it scares me a lot of the time where people say God is a loving God or what can separate us from the love of God nothing can separate you from the love of God even in hell God loves you but it's our choice that separates us our choice so we're all gonna make the right choice right yes a man I know I want to make the right choice I want to follow Jesus I want to be like Jesus amen amen how many of my young how many of my kids here want to be like Jesus raise your hand up to amen Bateman brother Ernie amen that's right you know you know well Jesus is the best there's no other hero like him they come close and I'm talking about Jesus's men on earth but Jesus is by far the top anything else disciples that you'd like to act ask Jesus about what we've learned children any other little children want to ask him anything what do you think you do you think it was it was it was he gave he gave he gave the rich young ruler a chance right he asked him exactly and Jesus was very honest with them right he told them what he had to do he told him come follow me see Jesus doesn't walk Jesus you don't push people right push Jesus see Jesus doesn't push us we're supposed to follow him where he goes I go what he does I do do you ever think Jesus would talk bad about somebody or make fun of somebody or hurt somebody's feelings no right there's a there was a saying that if you keep your mouth closed no flies will go in there which means don't say anything bad about anybody if you don't have anything good to say don't say anything bad even a comment we don't know what the person is going through we don't know what's happening in their lives if we can't be positive and full of love no comment all I want my brother's to know is like Jesus I love you unconditionally do we love each other unconditionally no matter what we got to get there amen amen unconditional love Jesus loved us all right amen amen but why don't we stand so we can pray Jesus thank you you do you have anything else for the congregation today no but I think we heard it I think what was said was enough so we'll let you chew on that and and even if you've just got a crumb for my brother Mike spoke remember I I multiply the bread and the fish so you just take that little crumb and ask God to multiply it in your life so that it may become a blessing and it may feel your spirit just with that little by our
