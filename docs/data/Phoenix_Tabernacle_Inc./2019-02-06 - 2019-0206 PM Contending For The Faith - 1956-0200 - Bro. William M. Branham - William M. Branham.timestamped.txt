[10:00] appreciate your prayers and as we come
[10:02] into these little you know evangelical
[10:05] services we don't come to represent any
[10:08] and he's a nomination any special groups
[10:10] of people we only come because we love
[10:13] Jesus and notice you loving to you and
[10:15] we come into these places for autonomous
[10:18] fellowships a fellowship around his word
[10:20] and around his comments blessing and I'm
[10:23] that's the only mortgage that we had is
[10:25] for these meetings and we're a bad
[10:29] denied to have a brother Tommy Nicholson
[10:32] with us here that I'm sure he's been
[10:34] introduced by better Oregon back which
[10:35] is the the editor for the Christian man
[10:38] fourth internationally a grouper man
[10:41] that I'm proud to belong to them it's a
[10:44] it's Christian businessman who has
[10:47] formed the organization and speak um a
[10:49] international affair they sponsor me
[10:52] most of my meetings around the world and
[10:55] he's the editor of the Christians man's
[10:58] voice and so we've been at the very
[11:02] fitting some testimonies all tasty to
[11:05] see where the divine healing rafts are
[11:07] hot we went on to mrs. Carter I hope
[11:09] they're here tonight Georgian mrs.
[11:12] Carter and George is one of the cases
[11:14] that repealed I believe around fourteen
[11:16] fifteen years ago I won your local man
[11:19] here mr. Hall which is one of the
[11:20] conference for the middle harm Baptist
[11:22] Church for Easter pastor and he was here
[11:24] here a few years ago of cancer given up
[11:26] in Louisville by the doctors around the
[11:29] country and well here tonight healthy
[11:31] and Hardy a team that incredible and
[11:33] we're over the place for the age of the
[11:36] Lord came down and told me what to do
[11:38] my Christian friends on this point we
[11:42] come to this saying we do not claim that
[11:45] we can do anything as our ministers
[11:49] ministry doesn't feature that I believe
[11:52] that we believe in divine healing
[11:53] because it's the gospel and no man can
[11:57] hear of anyone healing doesn't lay and
[12:00] the power of man really made in the
[12:03] power of God and doctors and good man
[12:06] power to heal
[12:07] god only gave Christ the Commission that
[12:13] come to earth to die in our state for
[12:15] our sins and our stupid the scripture
[12:18] said he was wounded for our
[12:19] transgressions with His stripes we were
[12:22] where is the past hence we were healed
[12:25] and we believe that upon our confession
[12:29] of failure the Jesus our high priest has
[12:34] died and rose again to take away sin
[12:37] from the world and they're sitting at
[12:40] the right hand of God the Father they're
[12:42] making intercessions upon our confession
[12:45] and when he died for our sins he could
[12:50] not die for sins without dying for
[12:52] sickness sickness or the arts of youth
[12:55] have seen momma's you haven't sinned as
[12:59] what causes should be stricken but if
[13:01] there's a cause of sin in the first
[13:03] place that brought sickness to the world
[13:06] they say have you ever had anything we
[13:09] have no sickness but when sickness came
[13:11] in sin is an attribute and now you try
[13:14] not deal with sin in any way without
[13:16] dealing with sickness our ever attribute
[13:18] that sin produced see when we do with
[13:21] sin we deal with faith when we deal in
[13:24] sickness is that the first phase of a
[13:27] I'm sick this takes your body in a night
[13:31] like this one moon gathering two days
[13:33] notice for you people to come out and
[13:35] gather in the building tonight it would
[13:39] be hard to try to go into detail when we
[13:41] were then the campaign's were relaxing
[13:42] for weeks and weeks to explain what
[13:45] insignia or does he come from
[13:47] there is nothing for what there's a
[13:49] reason far and there's a call and you
[13:53] say find the tour until you find a call
[13:56] I was saying there not long ago if I
[13:59] went to a doctor I'm certainly not
[14:01] against doctors surgeons operations
[14:04] hospitals there are God's plans but if I
[14:07] went to a doctor and told him I've had a
[14:09] persistent
[14:11] you give me a aspirin say now run along
[14:14] Billy this would be all right now that
[14:16] man is brushing me off the old a real
[14:19] doctor would diagnose not taste and see
[14:22] what was wrong with me then he's with
[14:24] you the bottom we're safe and then start
[14:26] working from there well now that's the
[14:28] way we have to work and and divine me
[14:30] our salvation to the soul the man comes
[14:34] and says that he's disturbed great
[14:35] really bodies this salvation
[14:37] the first thing to do you Minister do
[14:39] you go right down the line do you find
[14:41] back here or inside after what happened
[14:43] from there you bring it up that's the
[14:46] same thing it isn't in divine healing
[14:47] which did I mean there is not some power
[14:49] that God has given to a man and he Leela
[14:53] is alone in the atonement I want to ask
[14:56] you something called on orders ministers
[14:58] year from the different churches and how
[15:03] would you preach salvation for the soul
[15:05] the only things you could not say we say
[15:08] well harvest converted brother branham I
[15:10] would say two years ago I would say 20
[15:12] years ago no that's a mistake you're
[15:16] looking at 30 10 or 20 years ago but you
[15:18] were say nineteen hundred years ago when
[15:20] Jesus died Calvary he settlements in
[15:23] question forever there this really made
[15:26] the supreme price made the greatest
[15:29] sacrifice the true ruler of Calvary then
[15:33] we have right to salvation the price is
[15:36] paid so it isn't what you do it's what
[15:39] he done and your personal things are
[15:41] successful brings your salvation and now
[15:45] that he was brutal for our transmission
[15:47] with described River he know they've
[15:50] I've asked to make this statement that's
[15:52] just written a super not by any means if
[15:56] a certain or some animal Eddie's paw in
[16:00] my side and was cutting into my side and
[16:02] killing it
[16:03] there's no need to be trying to cut it
[16:04] all
[16:07] Kenny heard the feels a whole body
[16:09] that's where this was divided him when
[16:12] Jesus bell for thickness of Santa
[16:16] Calvary he had to deal with the heard of
[16:19] it which was sin and during Sonia he
[16:22] dealt with sickness with it good night
[16:24] to cut off the fall he just feel her
[16:27] head and took her Loretta
[16:28] so Jesus come to bridge the human really
[16:32] everything dirty and admiration was see
[16:36] him destroyed and the Garden of Eden and
[16:39] now we are the owners of our eternal
[16:44] salvation as we accept Christ as our
[16:47] Savior our crisis our healer we have
[16:49] both earnest money of our entire
[16:54] rejection when he comes with all of us
[16:58] out of this thing there's no man I've
[17:01] seen every dirty City also he had to
[17:04] dive dirty and if we service in heaven
[17:07] then the Bible says and they got to live
[17:09] and we could not do that
[17:11] so we're tenderly and it's truly God's
[17:14] grace facilities and we spend our own
[17:16] god bless you forgiven and your your
[17:20] confession as long as it holds build
[17:22] your salvation is perfect same as it was
[17:24] divine healing with your personal faith
[17:27] and a resurrected Lord Jesus so tonight
[17:30] I thought I would just and the heaviness
[17:32] little time of fellowship with in this
[17:36] moisture will hold churches and this
[17:38] little group of people can just read it
[17:40] together here the little city of
[17:42] Georgetown and we personally want to be
[17:46] faithful to the weather art and right
[17:48] and those who made this possible we want
[17:51] to thank this
[17:52] letting us have this gym room tonight
[17:54] for this service and I want to thank
[17:56] every Minister the chair and every
[17:58] member of any Church whether it is
[18:01] Protestant Catholic whether it is
[18:03] Orthodox Jew whatever it may be
[18:06] we're grateful for you to be here and
[18:09] want you to know that we've got no
[18:10] strings or no attachments on any one
[18:12] religion whatever you believe as long as
[18:15] you believe in the Lord Jesus Christ and
[18:16] he's your Savior you're my brother and
[18:18] sister and so that's the way we believe
[18:21] it and now we have his blessed words
[18:24] here before us
[18:25] now these any man that's able to to pull
[18:28] that back of his fingers that open it
[18:30] this way but there's no man can open the
[18:32] world to understand except Christ
[18:35] himself the Bible was written by
[18:38] inspiration
[18:39] shall we just saw it heard the moment to
[18:42] speak to the author before we open his
[18:44] book our kind Heavenly Father we have
[18:49] gathered here in the name of God eleven
[18:51] son the Lord Jesus who died freely for
[18:54] our sins and trespasses he died that he
[18:58] might save us from a life of sin and
[19:00] would take us home to heaven some
[19:03] glorious day at his coming he died our
[19:06] soul that by stripes that we might be
[19:08] healed of our sickness and he was
[19:11] wounded for our transgressions is
[19:13] bruised for our iniquity the chastening
[19:15] our pieces up on him and with His
[19:17] stripes we were healed saith the prophet
[19:20] now we pray the Heavenly Father to be
[19:23] merciful to us and that we just have
[19:27] this one night of gathering here in this
[19:30] city we pray this you of Bristol's who
[19:34] has made this possible for the gathering
[19:36] and also those who have gathered with us
[19:39] to fellowship around the word and we
[19:44] pray father that you bless everyone
[19:45] that's in divine presence also and they
[19:49] doin I shall all be remembered may it be
[19:53] a night like the apostolic gathering of
[19:55] days
[19:57] when people gather together little
[20:00] groups one night rather Saint Paul was
[20:03] preaching way into the night a young man
[20:06] were taught fell from the upper storey
[20:08] and his life was taken from him and Paul
[20:11] laid his body over the boy carpathian
[20:14] back his life we're thankful to have the
[20:17] same gospel tonight to preach to the
[20:19] people that God still is ring he heals
[20:23] the sick he forgives all of our sins and
[20:25] father we pray tonight it's your
[20:27] breasteses of people and now that is
[20:30] said in our humble word this if you ask
[20:33] the father anything in my name I'll do
[20:35] it and we believe that what we ask we
[20:38] receive because it's according to his
[20:40] word and when we leave here tonight
[20:43] different groups in going to our
[20:45] different homes when you visit us in
[20:48] such a way that we'll have a testimony
[20:50] in our heart and our conversation as we
[20:54] leave here will be like those who came
[20:56] from Emmaus on the first resurrection
[20:58] when they had met the resurrected Lord
[21:00] Jesus for the first time they said do
[21:04] not our hearts burn within us when he
[21:06] talked to us by the way
[21:07] may you talk to every heart tonight or
[21:11] we ask in the name of God the loving son
[21:13] the Lord Jesus amen
[21:21] opening to the gospel of Saint Jude in
[21:25] the Bible which is only one book one
[21:29] chapter then the third verse of this
[21:33] chapter I wish to read for just a little
[21:36] text to get a context from it for what
[21:38] I'd like to speak off for the next few
[21:40] moments then we will pray for this
[21:43] safety the letter I gave our observances
[21:47] to write unto you of the common
[21:49] salvation it was needful for me to write
[21:52] unto you
[21:53] and to exhort you that ye should
[21:55] earnestly contend for the faith once
[21:59] delivered unto the Saints may the Lord
[22:02] that is blessings to his word
[22:04] this was wrote from 33 years as you did
[22:08] the day of Pentecost I said that pouring
[22:11] out of the Holy Spirit on the early
[22:13] Saints Judith calls herself a servant
[22:18] and brother to Jesus Christ and he wrote
[22:21] this book to the church and told them
[22:23] that they should earnestly contend the
[22:27] only taste of the sacred writings that's
[22:29] ever told us to contend because we're
[22:31] not supposed to have contentions among
[22:32] us but the earnestly contend a purpose
[22:37] that was once delivered unto the Saints
[22:41] and such we're not to contend and we're
[22:45] not trying to contend
[22:46] but we're wanting to see if I should ask
[22:51] tonight
[22:51] how many Methodist is in the crowd how
[22:54] many baptisms in the crowd how many
[22:55] Nazarenes pilgrim holiness tackling but
[22:58] the hands grow up and even if little
[23:00] group of people here tonight there would
[23:02] be many hands full and each one of us
[23:05] and our German denominations would walk
[23:07] to save our church was confusing for
[23:10] that person that was once delivered to
[23:12] the Saints I want to sit and about the
[23:16] Baptist Church Cemetery want to say it
[23:18] about the Methodist Church someone else
[23:20] about the Catholic Church and some other
[23:21] in about it would be that way into
[23:23] little groups of people I have to
[23:26] believe that they are contending for
[23:28] that page I believe that everyone is
[23:30] contending for the best of
[23:33] to the face but in this means so many
[23:35] different denominations there's got to
[23:38] be something right and something wrong
[23:40] now that's what I've tried to be my
[23:43] brother's sister that you've never seen
[23:46] a male's drunk and sober at the same
[23:48] time you never see the bright white bird
[23:51] there's no such a thing and there's no
[23:53] right all mixed together
[23:56] it's either right or it's wrong and
[23:58] that's the way that I believe God if I
[24:01] believe the same job that live in the
[24:05] days of Moses he wasn't the same job to
[24:09] fulfill every promise that he made that
[24:11] accurate healthy to expecting now
[24:15] there's only that's very sensible and
[24:18] reasonable the things that separate
[24:22] wouldn't do us tonight you're not here
[24:24] just to be seen you wouldn't come out in
[24:26] this rain each other in a little place
[24:27] like this just to be seen you're here
[24:30] for one purpose let's find something
[24:32] good I pray that God will give each one
[24:35] of you something real good that you
[24:37] never forget which one of you Christians
[24:40] they need really sure a charge of him
[24:43] the cars you disturbing better than
[24:45] you've ever serving and all your life
[24:47] now that hope would it do to save a bog
[24:53] observe Moses a God that loves to serve
[24:56] and if he were from the same table today
[24:59] that good for to do to serve a
[25:01] historical God if he's know if his
[25:04] tireless and gone and very elated I want
[25:07] to answer that question you were part of
[25:09] it maybe a time if I think sure the god
[25:13] that's a living in Rogers presence to
[25:15] help me when I have needs so much use a
[25:18] certain time if he knows regard but he
[25:21] is a God now
[25:23] was about a power he's got the power now
[25:25] there something weakened about that
[25:27] dollar isn't a tree right now we want to
[25:31] reason together there's something wrong
[25:34] with his person as he was and he hears
[25:36] it now then there's something wrong with
[25:38] God if God doesn't agree mighty warrior
[25:45] and battle and he was a great healer of
[25:47] diseases and he was aggrieved in all
[25:50] this attributes and the days go by and
[25:52] then he lost all of his power and he
[25:54] nurses the same division Jeffers verbs
[25:56] therapy or thing today wrong if you do
[26:00] the very same thing to our ages until
[26:02] they come again is undisputable in the
[26:04] Bible he Brewster 813 a 13-8 letter says
[26:09] that Jesus Christ is the same yesterday
[26:10] today and forever that's the same in
[26:14] principle the same entire the same in
[26:16] resurrection the famous automatic
[26:19] sailing omnipresent the same and all
[26:23] he's just the same as he wasn't
[26:25] everything that he what's wrong he is
[26:27] today
[26:28] the scripture says that's true all
[26:31] things all in is the same Wow
[26:34] so if we each want to believe that but
[26:37] what limited to accrete well if there
[26:40] are bills to the Baptist Church I'll say
[26:42] bad just because that's the church I was
[26:44] ordained Ian they are the Baptist civil
[26:47] I freeze dried the Methodist was their
[26:49] friend right but if we learn
[26:51] that means I have nothing against it
[26:53] that's alright but if we limit the odds
[26:55] of that tree when we limit dollars and
[26:58] we try to say this you can walk this far
[27:00] maybe we don't have the face surreal for
[27:03] Amy did when he took a little walk with
[27:04] God one afternoon my home with you
[27:06] without there and in the very sort of
[27:10] Joshua way who must warm the Rose of
[27:11] Jericho thirteen pounds and and shot as
[27:14] we arrived and the welfare down we may
[27:17] not have the food to shot down wall we
[27:20] may not have faced the world homeless
[27:21] God but let's not say that somebody's
[27:23] where he drive has that faith if sight
[27:26] the definitely with our feet and they
[27:27] had moved on and please serve the Lord
[27:30] bless you my brother and the auto
[27:32] regardless the rapture she longs do that
[27:34] makes no difference as long as he's a
[27:36] Christian and believer and you know
[27:38] Christian friend that's not the
[27:40] repeatability I landed in Bombay India
[27:43] where the largest crowd of 500,000
[27:46] people are as the crowd ever preached to
[27:48] at one time in my life was in Bombay
[27:50] what I met that I become the bishop of
[27:53] the Methodist Church and many great
[27:55] churches reverently Archbishop a Hindu
[27:57] into his church there and many other the
[28:00] great outstanding churches they met me
[28:02] out there where thousands of people come
[28:03] to the airport
[28:04] and when they come and they thought you
[28:06] have to the Taj Mahal Hotel and they met
[28:07] in a room or similar to this at all so
[28:10] ever through the city in the Ray jaws
[28:12] and everything the Bishop of the
[28:14] Methodist Church he said brother Roman
[28:16] we don't accept you as a missionary he
[28:20] said because we don't want to hear every
[28:21] word missionary prayer because few
[28:24] people in the world with your Western
[28:27] education does not understand the
[28:30] scripture in the life of an oriental
[28:31] book and that's true for all of our
[28:35] theology if you ever go to Jerusalem are
[28:37] to the eastern country where this Bible
[28:39] is this
[28:40] a brand-new book - yes all Western ideas
[28:43] are far from the eastern range unit can
[28:47] understand the parables and so forth of
[28:49] teaching until you go there you see
[28:51] those same custom lived observation and
[28:53] many people say I have repeated senators
[28:57] and students and monasteries and so
[28:59] forth
[28:59] but all of that northern Oh God it's
[29:02] only know one Catechism and so forth
[29:04] like that
[29:04] Tamera God is to know the person Christ
[29:08] himself and to know here is life not to
[29:12] know the text refer to know your creases
[29:14] ordinary catechism his life is to know
[29:16] Christ the person is life eternal and
[29:19] that's what we wish to know now this was
[29:23] suddenly he said everything of theology
[29:26] that we had the Bible a thousand seven
[29:30] hundred years before you of the nation's
[29:32] that's right st. Thomas went down is a
[29:35] suit of the church and preach for st.
[29:37] Thomas the original church that he
[29:39] established in India when he went down
[29:41] from Jerusalem to India and established
[29:43] the church and he said we read the Bible
[29:46] ever since and and we heard Christianity
[29:49] since then but it's a lower order than
[29:51] India I said we have heard of dr. Reid
[29:54] head the man that came to you which is a
[29:56] the president of the great pseudo
[30:00] emissions the greatest the world who
[30:01] came to me and he said brother Branham
[30:03] there are brought of that degrees
[30:05] diverse parallel with them after the
[30:08] anagen I bachelor's degree and all kinds
[30:12] of the Greeks I was about eight years
[30:14] old when he said Bella Bella were
[30:16] realized in all of it he said has the
[30:19] teachers in all after the teachers
[30:21] hasn't been wrong sir you'll never know
[30:24] Christ our theology
[30:26] your presentation you've got to know
[30:28] Christ I've personal experience of being
[30:31] formed again marvelous spirit that comes
[30:34] by changes your - don't you a new
[30:36] creature in Christ Jesus
[30:37] that's right very different that's what
[30:39] makes the difference in our view now
[30:42] that's reason we have so many different
[30:43] denominations in series there are that
[30:46] the real thing Jesus Christ the Son of
[30:48] God said in st. John the Gospel of st.
[30:50] John the 3rd chapter or 3rd chapter for
[30:53] me the Nicodemus except a man be born
[30:56] again of water and spirit we will know
[31:01] never into the kingdom no matter what
[31:05] church you go to
[31:06] but Jesus Christ all words now to be
[31:09] born means to be delivered from now
[31:11] unless you are delivered by the Holy
[31:14] Spirit in your life to a new life in
[31:18] Christ that our preservation are no good
[31:22] but they're good they're all right
[31:24] they're more teachings and so forth
[31:25] which happens but the real personal
[31:28] Christ Jesus that made the meetings what
[31:31] it has been to do and swept around the
[31:33] world is because by the grace of God to
[31:36] introduce to the larger small crowds are
[31:40] resurrected Lord Jesus
[31:42] right now president and he same pilot
[31:44] level of them we don't have suggested it
[31:48] he said brother branham we had to lose
[31:50] we had to divert the bishop said and
[31:52] easier but there's that we're interested
[31:54] in with natural theology so that we're
[31:57] interested in hold jobs versus you
[32:01] Yankees with a spirit oil gifts that can
[32:05] make this Bible written so we know the
[32:09] virus and since after review just admit
[32:13] if we dismiss after the oil and I said
[32:18] that's the main thing is that that's
[32:20] what we want to know how do you say for
[32:22] nothing jobs and make these divine
[32:24] promises that he's made that I've used
[32:27] faith in us and make some realities I
[32:30] said by the grace of God Garfield and
[32:34] that's every nor was entertained by
[32:36] seventeen different religious that
[32:38] denied Christianity some of worship
[32:40] match and some of horses and some powder
[32:42] and some Buddha and muharram perfect and
[32:46] they all have a theology very good
[32:48] everything was works some but you have
[32:50] to do do this do that all routes no
[32:53] grace through it all and that you out
[32:56] for you there's just a rebounding huh
[32:58] I hope not the hurdle that guy here the
[33:03] thread remember Lord Jesus came on the
[33:06] scene there except the resolves over the
[33:08] pillars and so forth and it was over two
[33:10] dollars getting into the ride up to
[33:12] hillary convicted speaker stand and when
[33:14] the Lord Jesus came up and told a man
[33:17] that was totally blind to twenty years
[33:19] the revision over he the nervous will be
[33:22] near our charters every autumn become
[33:24] real the man first assess field that I
[33:28] read Jesus Billy's Emanuel Celler five
[33:31] or ten thousands and thousands came to
[33:34] Christ at one time there are creams
[33:38] would there is always more wrong but
[33:42] will reproduce the Lord Jesus
[33:44] and his promise it's another got your
[33:48] fries and I try to be just as Creepers
[33:53] up laughter can you get the heart
[33:54] started cause it's new bleep and you
[33:56] people work as illicit cereal
[33:59] the textures tonight we love it I do
[34:02] that rib just to write unto you of the
[34:04] common salvation this estate shoes huh
[34:07] writing to the church 33 years after
[34:10] typical and exactly you that you should
[34:14] service recent winters be pleased that
[34:18] anything these things that was once
[34:21] delivered unto the Saints now each one
[34:23] of us in our churches are fired and and
[34:25] I want to be with your church and
[34:27] support your church and heaven for the
[34:30] glory of God let's go back and find out
[34:33] all those subsidies something with whom
[34:37] he said earnestly contend every faith
[34:39] that was once the river to the state now
[34:47] let's go back in the Bible I think that
[34:50] would be logical and proof enough your
[34:53] additives if we wear back and see
[34:55] whether Saints wife had a face they had
[34:58] and if we were example to earnestly
[35:01] contend for this base we found out that
[35:04] gonna face the head when we artisan
[35:06] bread for that thing
[35:08] right now resigned out that it was the
[35:11] theory whatever cause Saints in the
[35:14] Bible there was a new tenant John the
[35:16] Baptist come between the law and Christ
[35:18] which was a death of the key stone that
[35:21] locks the two dispensations together and
[35:23] we have to begin this crisis or he'll
[35:26] talk about Christian service because he
[35:28] is the beginning of Christian Saint John
[35:32] 3 John the Baptist preached in the
[35:34] wilderness of Judea and he never got
[35:37] more medical never done anything but he
[35:39] does confirm the churches and condemned
[35:42] the priests in the red eyes and tell you
[35:45] I was coming on he saw Jesus coming with
[35:51] the right qualities and he said behold
[35:53] the lamb of God which taketh away the
[35:54] sin of the world this is my beloved Son
[36:02] in whom I am pleased to dwell the
[36:05] original translation says in whom I am
[36:07] pleased to dwell a me which God was in
[36:09] Christ reconciling the world to himself
[36:10] he was God in flesh now let's notice
[36:15] reptile writes that he did not ask you
[36:18] something what he was saying we should
[36:24] because that's the face that he
[36:26] introduced to the world that ought to be
[36:28] the face that we should content or not
[36:30] is that right it should be all right I
[36:34] remember too soon as these faggot-ass in
[36:39] ministry he had wished in the and he
[37:41] should come see who I found Jesus of
[37:44] Nazareth the son of Joseph and he said
[37:48] for any good thing come out of Nazareth
[37:49] the sender said he said son please I
[37:52] think that's the best answer that any
[37:54] persons to give it any time is before
[37:57] criticizing anything that's right they
[38:08] might have had a thing back to that ever
[38:10] save the religion of Jesus Christ as men
[38:14] [Music]
[38:18] see and you're not all the world when
[38:21] you become a Christian you are a
[38:23] different person from the world we know
[38:25] that Jesus said I pray father that they
[38:28] might be other little so the scripture
[38:39] says that so you take that to master
[38:42] Jesus mercy Jesus said that to st.
[38:54] Matthew the fifth chapter they'd serve
[38:57] the God in the war at the same time
[38:58] you've got to be one or the other people
[39:04] in this nation and profess to be
[39:09] Christians unbelievable that's such a
[39:13] whole time to make up his mind is
[39:15] because he sees people as part of that
[39:17] system live no difference in the rest of
[39:20] the world that's pretty great but that's
[39:22] true we got the face truth there's
[39:24] probably many waiters sitting here I'll
[39:26] never see again or I'll see you at
[39:27] suggestion and I've got to be truthful
[39:30] and honest because I've got to face the
[39:33] judgment and meet my words again at the
[39:35] judgment I have to be truthful about it
[39:37] now
[39:38] we've ever said that Philip as soon as
[39:41] he found nathanael he said come see we
[39:43] are found and the favors with a
[39:45] righteous man of the men he said to
[39:47] there be any good thing come out of
[39:49] Nazareth Nazareth ravine wicked City
[39:52] very bad at all gangsters and so forth
[39:55] raised up and and
[39:57] bands in those days that came out of
[39:59] masses various fire city he said but
[40:02] anything good come out of Nazareth he
[40:03] said come and see my dream is to do for
[40:07] church
[40:14] [Music]
[40:34] 21st chapter says that he will do that
[40:37] at least second chapter other otherwise
[40:39] for survival he said if anybody join now
[40:57] when he found Nathanael and he said come
[41:00] see so he's already October man Jesus
[41:03] was rather defying Jesus tonight if we
[41:07] went for a bioterrorist Jesus Christ
[41:09] resident Georgetown Indiana but then he
[41:12] was in human flesh like we are tonight
[41:14] that type of a person would we want to
[41:16] find out this may be shocking for me
[41:26] dress just like other man there's no
[41:28] difference in this dress
[41:29] we come to be heard in the street when
[41:40] we come to find a man that was a
[41:55] [Music]
[42:16] [Music]
[42:27] don't even believe in our church and
[42:30] they wear the church of the day well you
[42:32] see you take that church you've got to
[42:34] go by just raise your hand up brother
[42:54] I want you to heal me done that's right
[42:57] this about general everywhere how many
[43:10] Christians believe that they see your
[43:12] hand
[43:12] that's fine then be sure and leave the
[43:15] same Lord Jesus the father surely and
[43:26] the father sending in the life I do know
[43:32] this first lady's been here and I don't
[43:37] know now whether I know you honest or
[43:41] not I've seen that lady about seven has
[43:44] heard from the back or up here
[43:46] but I've seen that I'd respect about the
[43:48] only ones that are that on or off and
[43:57] that's about the only ones that I know
[43:59] all right
[44:00] not at the start hit the moment prepare
[44:02] Heavenly Father this is the moment I
[44:05] have the best of my knowledge about you
[44:09] now our dear Lord Jesus I pray that your
[44:11] help means I know that I know nothing
[44:15] about these people sometimes I know who
[44:20] they are I don't know their troubles

[44:25] and I humble myself and submit myself to
[44:27] these that's a great Holy Spirit will
[44:31] come tonight and take this poor unworthy
[44:33] man where the glory of God and anoint
[44:36] and don't let them speak my own lips but
[44:39] let the Holy Spirit speak and do the
[44:42] works that Jesus Christ the Son of God
[44:43] so that he wouldn't do through his

[46:08] what you are here for and what you want
[46:11] of him if he will make himself so
[46:14] positive that and he'll declare what you
