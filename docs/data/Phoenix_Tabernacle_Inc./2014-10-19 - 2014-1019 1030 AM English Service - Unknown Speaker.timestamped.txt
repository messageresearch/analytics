[36:22] that he died yesterday but guess what
[36:25] the date of three days he raised from
[36:29] that
[36:30] tomb so if he beat the dead if I could
[36:34] say it that
[36:35] way what else can he do there's I mean
[36:38] that's right he can do everything he
[36:41] does everything for us so there's
[36:44] nothing impossible for our Lord Jesus
[36:46] Christ and that's what our mind our
[36:49] heart has to be thinking of I know with
[36:52] our Lord Jesus Christ I know that I have

[49:11] amen good
[49:14] morning uh it is an honor and a
[49:16] privilege to be in the house of the Lord
[49:19] and I feel like something's
[49:24] missing uh I told a brother back there
[49:26] there I go there's something missing
[49:29] here and uh I still feel
[49:32] that and you all know what it is
[49:36] right um where's The
[49:40] Interpreter you get so used to doing
[49:42] something you know becomes a habit you
[49:45] know and it just becomes something you
[49:48] don't even think about it just automatic
[49:50] so I I feel like there's something
[49:53] missing there you know but I I believe
[49:56] God going to help us this morning amen
[49:58] and everything we do and we say how many
[50:00] are happy to be here in the house of the
[50:04] Lord how many can say that you're happy
[50:06] to be a
[50:08] Christian how many are happy to say that
[50:11] you're a message
[50:12] believer Are you ashamed of this message
[50:15] no Are you ashamed of the messenger no
[50:19] I'm not right so whatever he said we
[50:23] want to say we only want to repeat what
[50:24] he
[50:25] said and
[50:27] it's not easy though you know because
[50:31] you will become the minority instead of
[50:33] the
[50:34] majority and as time goes on it just
[50:37] seems like it's getting smaller and
[50:38] smaller and smaller and less less people
[50:42] are believe in this message this message
[50:44] is a hard message you know that right
[50:48] you know a lot of people sympathize with
[50:50] it but they can't live it you know and
[50:54] some people believe it but they just
[50:56] can't live it that's the hard part is to
[51:00] live it isn't that right and the only
[51:03] way you can do that or accomplish that
[51:04] is that the Holy Spirit has to come to
[51:06] you and give it to you you cannot Merit
[51:10] it you know you can't pray for it it's
[51:13] just God Sovereign and his grace to you
[51:16] he predestinated you before the
[51:17] foundation World God picked you that
[51:20] that's simple real simple isn't it you
[51:22] know it's like I say I picked this
[51:24] brother here brother Enoch that simple
[51:26] God picked us that's you know that's
[51:28] right and you say well he picked you
[51:32] brother Johnny yep y unbelievable
[51:35] huh I'm a mess and we're all Sinners
[51:39] that's right and come short of the glory
[51:41] of
[51:42] God you know when God came looking for
[51:44] somebody he didn't come and look for the
[51:46] righteous and the good you know he came
[51:49] for he came looking for the the Sinners
[51:52] the lost the Wayward came looking for
[51:55] the prostitute and the Pharisees stood
[51:58] there and the Sadducees stood there you
[52:00] know and here a woman approaches him and
[52:03] comes to his feet begging for
[52:06] mercy yeah because she was a ill Fame
[52:10] woman and I can imagine the the the
[52:13] priest said well does he doesn't he know
[52:16] who that is you
[52:18] know but Jesus turned around and said
[52:21] addressed himself to them he says you
[52:24] are your father the devil
[52:26] religious people holy people godly
[52:30] people and he called them
[52:34] devils and The Sinner woman he says go
[52:38] and sin no more or a worse thing come
[52:41] upon you well I can identify myself with
[52:44] that prostitute amen we're all Sinners
[52:47] brothers and sisters and we're here
[52:49] because of the grace of
[52:52] God I uh I'm kind of a
[52:59] uh messed up
[53:01] person and somebody said well what do
[53:03] you talk like that about yourself
[53:04] brother Johnny because we're all on the
[53:06] same
[53:09] boat you know I believe that there's
[53:12] something wrong with every human
[53:14] being ain't nobody perfect Amen brother
[53:17] humanly speaking amen if there's
[53:19] anything good in us you know what it is
[53:21] God's spirit in us that's why it's
[53:24] called the Holy Spirit Amen in us that's
[53:28] what's good about us if you got if you
[53:30] become a Christian God gives you that
[53:31] little one little piece of that lick
[53:33] that lick of that Pillar of Fire that's
[53:36] what's good about you but as human
[53:38] beings we're rotten no good for nothing
[53:41] nothing good about
[53:44] us so we're on the same boat you know
[53:47] you're not in another boat we're on the
[53:49] same boat we're all messed up yes we all
[53:53] have failures we all have weaknesses
[53:56] some have more than one some have two or
[53:58] three weaknesses you know I feel sorry
[54:01] for them you know normal the normal
[54:04] person has one weakness right everybody
[54:07] has one weakness Jesus had a weakness
[54:10] his weakness was Hunger you see the
[54:12] flesh that that fake tree didn't put up
[54:15] the the fruit when was supposed to so
[54:17] what did he do he cursed it well God
[54:20] knows himself it wasn't even time for it
[54:22] to bear fruit at that
[54:23] time and yet God broke his own law right
[54:26] there he got upset he go well it you're
[54:30] going to wither away and it it it dried
[54:32] up is that right but Jesus had a
[54:35] weakness now we don't have weaknesses
[54:38] right come on we all have weaknesses and
[54:42] that's that one spot right there is the
[54:44] one you have to take care of more than
[54:45] anything else you got to protect it you
[54:48] know so um my weakness
[54:54] is oh brother Johnny you're going to see
[54:56] a we weakness come on
[54:59] now well I'm going to I'm going to do it
[55:01] like the women do it like brother M says
[55:03] he talked to his wife and says she
[55:05] wouldn't tell him and he said brother B
[55:07] said you know how women are they like to
[55:08] keep you in
[55:10] suspense well I'm going to keep you in
[55:12] suspense figure it out what's my
[55:15] [Music]
[55:16] weakness well I am a woman too you know
[55:18] that spiritually speaking I'm a woman so
[55:20] the Church of God is a woman so
[55:23] sometimes you know we act like a
[55:25] woman but that doesn't mean I'm a
[55:27] homosexual now that's right now you know
[55:31] U the Bible says that as it was in the
[55:34] days of Sodom and gomorra so shall it be
[55:35] at the coming of the son of man when the
[55:38] son of man would be revealed in our
[55:40] midst yes are we living in that day does
[55:44] it repeat again are we living in the
[55:47] last days as it was in the days of Sodom
[55:50] and gorra so shall it be at the coming
[55:52] of the son of man when he reveals
[55:55] himself and do we have that Revelation
[55:58] before us when God sent a prophet
[56:01] Malachi 4:5 and6 he was not the son of
[56:04] man but he was revealing the son of man
[56:06] to us the word of God is that
[56:09] right
[56:10] now I'm going to read you a code here
[56:13] and and I've got a little problem here I
[56:15] always have a lot of problems I have a
[56:16] lot of problems but one of my problems
[56:18] is God tells me speak on this amen and
[56:24] then I want to speak on this and then
[56:26] something else comes in and get once to
[56:28] get inserted in there so I'm a mess I
[56:31] don't know if I should say this or say
[56:32] this so I compromise and I try to put
[56:35] them together you understand what I'm
[56:37] saying okay so but I'm I'm not doing any
[56:41] benefit to one or the other because I'm
[56:43] kind of stealing one from the other see
[56:45] what I'm saying so I'm going to read you
[56:48] a quote here okay this is not on the
[56:50] PowerPoint up there yet I'm going to
[56:51] read you a code another code another
[56:53] code another code just love to read just
[56:55] like to repeat that's that's what a
[56:57] minister is supposed to do you get up
[56:58] here and you just repeat right we don't
[57:01] interpret the word of the Lord doesn't
[57:04] come to us like it come to the prophet
[57:08] because the Bible says surely the Lord
[57:09] thy God will do nothing but he reveals
[57:11] the fness unto the prophets and the word
[57:13] comes to the prophet first reveals it to
[57:16] him and then the prophet reveals to the
[57:17] people amen okay and then we just repeat
[57:20] what he said that's all we are
[57:23] repeaters okay I'm going to read your
[57:25] quote here it's not up there this is uh
[57:28] 1958 it's uh the message is Faith
[57:32] harenberg I think it's Virginia I
[57:34] believe brother M says this oh Eternal
[57:37] God you said in your scripture that when
[57:38] the son of man shall reveal himself from
[57:40] heaven in the last days I truly believe
[57:43] that you're now revealing yourself from
[57:46] Heaven to the church in Mercy and peace
[57:49] and the next time you reveal yourself it
[57:51] will be judgment upon those who reject
[57:56] speaks for itself doesn't
[57:58] it he says here I TR believe that you're
[58:01] now revealing yourself from Heaven to
[58:03] the
[58:05] church that's what brother batt said
[58:08] okay another quote Feast of the
[58:11] trumpets brother M said and Jesus says
[58:14] As it was in the days of lot so so will
[58:17] it be at the coming of the son so will
[58:19] it be at the coming of the end of the
[58:21] world when the son of man not Son of God
[58:23] when the son of man will will be
[58:27] revealing I'll read that over again
[58:30] Jesus says As it was in the days of lot
[58:32] so will it be at the coming of the end
[58:34] of the world when the son of man not the
[58:37] Son of God when the son of man will be
[58:42] revealing have we had the manifestation
[58:45] of the son of man in our time yes or
[58:48] no right the son of man not the one that
[58:53] died on the cross no okay but his Spirit
[58:57] Jes the spirit of Jesus Christ amen in
[58:59] our time and another man a
[59:02] prophet the Bible says that he will send
[59:04] the spirit of Elijah five times is that
[59:06] right okay and I believe it's the fourth
[59:08] one he said he would bring him under
[59:10] Malachi 4:5 and 6 the next time he
[59:13] brings the spirit of Elijah it'll be to
[59:15] the Jews but the spirit of Elijah is the
[59:18] Lord Jesus
[59:20] Christ okay so then we see the ministry
[59:24] of the son man revealed before us in our
[59:26] time the son not the Son of God when the
[59:29] son of man will be revealing revealing
[59:33] hadn't had it Through the Ages see
[59:35] that's a perfect continuity of the
[59:38] scriptures
[59:39] okay
[59:42] now I might might get myself in trouble
[59:44] for what I'm going to say here okay and
[59:47] see I have a problem I should be getting
[59:49] into the message that I I prepared that
[59:52] I have in my heart that I want to speak
[59:54] but then this is gets inserted in there
[59:58] understand now did you
[1:00:03] know I'm sure you do some of you I want
[1:00:06] you to raise your hand when I ask you
[1:00:07] this question and this could and might
[1:00:09] get me in trouble well well what can I
[1:00:13] do can help it okay did you know I think
[1:00:16] it was yesterday or the day before that
[1:00:19] the State of
[1:00:20] Arizona has declared that now a man can
[1:00:22] marry a man how many know that raise
[1:00:25] your hand amen wow look at all those
[1:00:28] hands it's official now brothers and
[1:00:31] sisters a man can marry a
[1:00:34] man and it's not
[1:00:37] wrong it's not wrong it's a law now it's
[1:00:42] a law and a woman can marry a
[1:00:46] woman okay and there's nothing wrong
[1:00:49] with that okay according to the law of
[1:00:53] manh wow and that's just happened in our
[1:00:56] precious beautiful State of the State of
[1:00:59] Arizona where the pillar of fire the
[1:01:01] cloud in 1963 appeared over this state
[1:01:07] okay making it a a a holy place okay but
[1:01:12] now look look at the state of Earth and
[1:01:15] there's it's not the only state there
[1:01:16] many other states have declared the same
[1:01:18] thing so now it's not wrong for a man to
[1:01:22] marry a man let me ask you a question
[1:01:26] is it
[1:01:28] wrong let's say Let's uh let's uh paint
[1:01:32] a little picture here let's say it's
[1:01:34] okay okay I give you 20 30
[1:01:38] years from
[1:01:40] now what they going to do when the
[1:01:44] population stops to exist because a man
[1:01:48] and a man cannot make a baby you know
[1:01:51] that right and a woman and a woman
[1:01:54] cannot make a baby
[1:01:56] so in 20 years from now that race is
[1:01:58] going to you know you seen those thing
[1:02:01] that those little plastic bottles that
[1:02:03] disintegrate themselves you know
[1:02:09] self-destructive that's what they're
[1:02:10] that's what they're that's what they're
[1:02:12] doing now that that's the plan in
[1:02:15] mind man marry a man and a woman marry a
[1:02:17] woman okay so we're not going to have
[1:02:20] they're not going to have no more
[1:02:22] children so let's say we lived another
[1:02:24] hundred years what are we going to do
[1:02:26] then the world's not getting populated
[1:02:29] anymore okay so to me definitely it's
[1:02:32] wrong okay I'm going to read you a
[1:02:35] scripture here okay I'm not reading you
[1:02:38] message I'm reading you
[1:02:40] scripture and for those people out there
[1:02:42] on YouTube okay that hear this I know
[1:02:45] the law make man makes the law but
[1:02:48] there's one law above man's law and
[1:02:50] that's God's
[1:02:51] law God's law is
[1:02:54] supreme amen that's the law I go
[1:02:58] by I'm going to read you Romans
[1:03:01] 1:24 through 32 wherefor God also gave
[1:03:05] them up to uncleanliness through the
[1:03:07] lust of their own Hearts to dishonor
[1:03:10] their own bodies between
[1:03:14] themselves wow you going read with me
[1:03:16] Romans 1 24 it's not up there now it's
[1:03:19] not up there well there it is maybe it
[1:03:21] is well those guys back to our fast I'll
[1:03:24] tell you that woo
[1:03:27] 24 that's what 24th say what's I saying
[1:03:29] that they dishonor their own bodies
[1:03:31] between themselves who change the truth
[1:03:35] of God into a lie and worship and serve
[1:03:38] the the creature more than the Creator
[1:03:40] who is blessed forever more forever amen
[1:03:43] for this cause gave them up unto vile
[1:03:46] affections for even their women did not
[1:03:49] change their natural use unto that which
[1:03:51] is against nature and like also the men
[1:03:54] leaving the natural use of the women
[1:03:56] burn in their in their lust one towards
[1:04:00] another men with men working that which
[1:04:04] is unseemingly and receiving in
[1:04:06] themselves that recompense of their
[1:04:08] error which was meat is that
[1:04:13] Bible is it telling you it's
[1:04:16] wrong so can you imagine their minds
[1:04:19] their mentality you know what what you
[1:04:22] know what they're you know what they're
[1:04:24] expressing to me
[1:04:26] that's
[1:04:27] Insanity that's
[1:04:29] insanity and when you get out of the
[1:04:31] word of God the dev insanity and that's
[1:04:36] the condition that the world is in right
[1:04:38] now Total Insanity and people are going
[1:04:41] totally insane why brother why because
[1:04:44] it's total darkness upon the Earth right
[1:04:46] now we are in the lady oia Church age
[1:04:49] the last Church age and there was maybe
[1:04:52] a little little streak of light there
[1:04:55] but then brother Brown said it went into
[1:04:57] total
[1:04:58] darkness so right
[1:05:01] now what I suggest to you we all want to
[1:05:05] be in the
[1:05:07] light what I suggest to you is you need
[1:05:09] to run Amen to the feet of Jesus which
[1:05:13] is the word of God brought To Us by a
[1:05:16] prophet Malachi 4:5 and6 and if you do
[1:05:19] not okay you were going totally insane
[1:05:24] right
[1:05:25] what what is the dominating Spirit right
[1:05:27] now in the
[1:05:28] world
[1:05:31] sex wow that's even coming to the church
[1:05:36] now not just the church but under the
[1:05:39] banner of the message Malachi
[1:05:42] 4556 a man can leave his wife and marry
[1:05:45] another one just because she maybe she's
[1:05:49] too
[1:05:50] fat yeah or maybe she's
[1:05:54] lazy the does that give you a right to
[1:05:56] put away a
[1:05:58] woman because she's fat and
[1:06:01] lazy sisters can you put your husband
[1:06:04] away because he's fat and lazy no I'm
[1:06:07] not trying to make excuses for me now
[1:06:09] okay okay but is that is that an
[1:06:14] excuse I'll go a little
[1:06:17] further let's say somebody does commit
[1:06:20] or make a
[1:06:22] mistake you have the option man to put
[1:06:25] that woman away if you want
[1:06:27] to but if you want to you can also
[1:06:29] forgive
[1:06:31] her yes sir yes brother B said there
[1:06:34] remember that remember that young man
[1:06:36] and that woman where she was a holy
[1:06:39] consecrated Christian from from Child
[1:06:42] almost she was raised a Christian okay
[1:06:45] and then she married this man this young
[1:06:48] man I guess you were young and he wasn't
[1:06:50] brought up like that he was in the
[1:06:52] world and he was in the world he lived
[1:06:54] in the world
[1:06:56] then one day he met God or God met him
[1:06:59] gave his heart to the Lord Jesus
[1:07:01] Christ and it was hard for him because
[1:07:04] he was a a newly converted Christian and
[1:07:08] one day brother B relates the story and
[1:07:09] says look honey if someday you ever make
[1:07:11] a mistake don't run away come back how
[1:07:16] many wives could say that to their
[1:07:19] husbands if you make a mistake if you
[1:07:22] make a mistake don't run away come back
[1:07:25] how many women could say that now this
[1:07:27] is Brother Brad I'm talking
[1:07:32] okay because his weakness maybe with
[1:07:36] women okay we all have a
[1:07:39] weakness
[1:07:42] okay what what
[1:07:44] a what an example brother Brandon gives
[1:07:46] us there huh wow so could we put
[1:07:50] ourselves in that situation
[1:07:55] oh brother I can't do that well brother
[1:07:59] R gives that little illustration there
[1:08:00] that he could even
[1:08:02] forgive she could forgive him you know
[1:08:05] says no matter what you do if you fall
[1:08:08] he says don't run away I'll be here for
[1:08:11] you come back wow to me
[1:08:15] that's that's
[1:08:18] with that's not conceivable in the human
[1:08:22] mind can I say something here
[1:08:26] did you know that only the
[1:08:28] bride can
[1:08:30] forgive amen that's
[1:08:34] right only the bride can
[1:08:37] forgive thank you Lord wow I shouldn't

[1:10:56] one man you know that that's the
[1:10:58] original plan you know I know we're all
[1:11:01] messed up that's why brother B says when

[1:11:06] marriage brother B says
[1:11:09] stop I forgive you all just don't do it
[1:11:12] again amen marriage and divorce was such

[1:11:17] stood in the breach they said I forgive
[1:11:20] you all just don't do it again yes right

[1:11:58] flowers on it so I'll just read this
[1:12:00] version King James version if a man also
[1:12:03] lies lie if a man also lie with
[1:12:08] mankind as he lie with a woman both of

[1:13:03] should all
[1:13:05] ask now see I'm having a hard time here
[1:13:09] CU I should already get into the message
[1:13:12] but I'm still stuck here this's other
[1:13:15] thing that's inserted in
[1:13:17] there I'm going to read you another
[1:13:19] quote Feast of the trumpets and in the
[1:13:21] papers Across the Nation that we have on
[1:13:24] the board it displayed it now how that
[1:13:26] the moon turned from light to Darkness
[1:13:30] and the Very phenomena of it that the
[1:13:33] moon draw exactly in the sky the same
[1:13:35] thing that the Holy Spirit had me to
[1:13:36] draw here two years ago and showing
[1:13:39] covering when it went six pictures
[1:13:42] remember that when brother M talks about
[1:13:43] the the six
[1:13:45] moons how they had six lunar eclipse
[1:13:48] remember that and the Holy Spirit how he
[1:13:50] came and draw it right on the wall and
[1:13:53] there was 300 people witnessed that and
[1:13:55] saw that is that right how many of you
[1:13:59] remember that raise your
[1:14:01] hand see not everybody that's that's
[1:14:04] what makes it hard okay
[1:14:08] okay it put six pictures then brother B
[1:14:11] says I put the seventh on there because
[1:14:14] the seventh church is just a shadow of a
[1:14:16] light the going that's where Jesus at
[1:14:19] the door
[1:14:20] knocking lady you see Church age Jesus
[1:14:23] knocking at the door because the
[1:14:27] church had kicked Jesus out outside and
[1:14:31] he's knocking at the door trying to get
[1:14:33] back into the human man the human kind
[1:14:37] or
[1:14:39] Humanity that's lady how many remember
[1:14:43] that Revelations 3 remember
[1:14:46] that that's where Jesus at the door
[1:14:49] knocking but it goes into total darkness
[1:14:52] that's exactly in the hour that we're
[1:14:55] we're living right now is in total total
[1:15:02] darkness wish that was the church and
[1:15:04] the Moon is the church represents the
[1:15:06] church and before the church the shadow
[1:15:09] of the world crosses the moon and the
[1:15:11] shadow of royalism the shadow of
[1:15:14] royalism worldly church has swept across
[1:15:18] to black out the entire light of the
[1:15:20] Bible the world got in the light of the
[1:15:23] reflection do you understand the world
[1:15:25] crossed in the light of the Moon and
[1:15:27] blinded out the Sun the reflection of
[1:15:30] the Moon that's supposed to be giving
[1:15:32] light to the Earth it was blacked out
[1:15:35] and it and it come in and draw the
[1:15:37] picture just exactly like it did by
[1:15:39] inspiration before it happened now that
[1:15:42] I believe sister Simpson was a Tucson
[1:15:45] paper right I don't know if Sister
[1:15:46] Simpson knew she didn't understand it
[1:15:48] then she said I cut out some of the
[1:15:50] pictures for you some notes out of the
[1:15:52] paper handed it to me and I thought
[1:15:55] something strange I went in there and
[1:15:56] picked it up and looked at it and said
[1:15:58] there it is that's exactly just what
[1:16:00] I've seen looking for and there it was
[1:16:02] in the paper sister sinon might tell you
[1:16:04] what the paper is it is it in there if
[1:16:07] you want to get a
[1:16:11] copy uh it's in December 28th and and
[1:16:16] that's what says it's in the evening
[1:16:17] edition of December the 28th evening the
[1:16:20] edition of December the 28 see before we
[1:16:22] went to Jerusalem to block out its light
[1:16:25] or what access it does have what time
[1:16:28] position and what's right it has to
[1:16:30] shine now it's cutting it off altogether
[1:16:32] for the last age the seventh age where
[1:16:35] she goes into
[1:16:37] darkness what a great thing the Lord is
[1:16:39] telling us in everything it's never
[1:16:42] failed out what God in heaven has
[1:16:43] declared it out and told it look at it
[1:16:46] and here it it identified it and
[1:16:48] Vindicated and that is absolutely the
[1:16:52] truth total darkness
[1:16:55] how many understand that we just had a a
[1:16:59] total lunar
[1:17:01] eclipse October the eth we had a total
[1:17:05] lunar
[1:17:06] eclipse how many knew
[1:17:08] that okay everybody knows that right
[1:17:11] then after that okay right now the Jews
[1:17:15] you know how the Jews are under the law
[1:17:18] okay and they have certain Festival days
[1:17:22] where they celebrate and right now the
[1:17:25] Jews are celebrating the Feast of the
[1:17:27] Tabernacles how many know that amen
[1:17:31] okay I believe today is maybe like the
[1:17:33] fourth day or something like that and it
[1:17:36] ends like around I think Wednesday I
[1:17:40] think it
[1:17:41] ends seven days the Feast of the
[1:17:45] Tabernacle and at the end of that okay
[1:17:49] of the Feast of the Tabernacles okay we
[1:17:52] have another eclipse but this is not a
[1:17:55] lunar eclipse this is a solar
[1:17:58] eclipse that's
[1:18:01] different how many know what the
[1:18:03] difference between a a lunar eclipse and
[1:18:05] a solar eclipse
[1:18:06] is one two three a few people do and I
[1:18:10] try to I'll try to explain it real quick
[1:18:12] see if I can explain to
[1:18:14] you here's the sun okay here's the
[1:18:19] moon here's the Earth
[1:18:22] okay when the moon is between the Sun
[1:18:26] and the Earth that's a solar
[1:18:29] eclipse
[1:18:31] understand and then a lunar eclipse is
[1:18:34] when you have the Sun and then you have
[1:18:36] the Earth then you have the moon so the
[1:18:40] light that's shining on the moon the
[1:18:43] Earth gets in the way so the light the
[1:18:47] all the light of the sun cannot reflect
[1:18:49] on the moon because the Earth is in the
[1:18:53] way and the Earth Earth gets in the way
[1:18:56] every time when we have a lunar eclipse
[1:18:59] or in other words the Earth the
[1:19:02] world the
[1:19:04] worlden gets in the way and that's the
[1:19:08] problem the world gets in the way and
[1:19:11] the world has come into the
[1:19:14] [Music]
[1:19:18] church in the in the church now what do
[1:19:21] we have we have everything
[1:19:24] like if it was in the world
[1:19:28] right we have
[1:19:33] sodomites we have
[1:19:35] lesbians we have adulterers we have
[1:19:39] fornicators we have smokers we have
[1:19:41] drinkers we have lust lustful
[1:19:44] people right the
[1:19:47] world got in the way so the light that
[1:19:51] Shin from the Sun could not hit the moon
[1:19:54] directly
[1:19:55] because the world got in the
[1:19:57] way and that's a natural thing okay but
[1:20:01] it speaks of a spiritual thing and when
[1:20:04] we let the world get in the way the
[1:20:06] light the Rays of the light of the
[1:20:08] Gospel of Jesus Christ to show us his
[1:20:11] power and his deliverance and his
[1:20:14] guidance doesn't shine upon us the way
[1:20:16] it should because the world gets in the
[1:20:19] [Music]
[1:20:21] way how many you understand that very
[1:20:23] simple right so on October the 8th we
[1:20:26] had a total lunar eclipse total lunar
[1:20:29] eclipse and then we have the Feast of
[1:20:31] the Tabernacles and the Feast of the
[1:20:33] Tabernacles brother bandam explains it
[1:20:35] and I don't I can't read you the quote
[1:20:37] because it's too much the Feast of the
[1:20:38] Tabernacles speaks about the
[1:20:41] millenum that's what it speaks about the
[1:20:43] Feast of the Tabernacles okay but then
[1:20:46] brother brandham in in a shadow of a
[1:20:47] shadow of a shadow he said you know
[1:20:49] brother you know the Jews did you know
[1:20:51] they had seven Church ages how many you
[1:20:53] knew that
[1:20:55] that's under the law Israel had seven
[1:20:57] Church ages and that's us Gentiles we
[1:21:01] had seven Church
[1:21:02] ages seven feasts seven Tabernacles
[1:21:05] seven Church ages first the Jews then
[1:21:07] the Gentiles okay and then the Feast of
[1:21:10] the
[1:21:12] Tabernacle brother BR explains and tells
[1:21:15] us it's that last day the
[1:21:20] Millennium probably went over your head
[1:21:22] didn't I huh
[1:21:25] but it's a shadow of a shadow of a
[1:21:27] shadow okay
[1:21:30] now I'm going to I'm going to skip all
[1:21:32] that
[1:21:34] okay
[1:21:37] wow I I uh I pulled out this thing from
[1:21:40] the the internet I know I know you can't
[1:21:42] see it and I don't have it on I don't
[1:21:43] have it on the
[1:21:44] PowerPoint but I'm just going to show
[1:21:47] you here maybe you can see it see this
[1:21:49] little thing right
[1:21:50] here here's the
[1:21:53] sun this is the moon and this is the
[1:21:56] Earth and this is a solar eclipse see
[1:22:00] the sun wants to give the light to the
[1:22:02] Earth but then the moon gets in the way
[1:22:03] see that that's a solar eclipse the
[1:22:05] lunar eclipse is when the sun is here
[1:22:07] and then the Earth gets in the
[1:22:09] way and then the moon
[1:22:12] gets uh an
[1:22:16] eclipse all those things mean something
[1:22:19] now I'm not I'm not going to get into
[1:22:21] the the four blood moons and all those
[1:22:23] things because
[1:22:24] that is assigned to the Jews okay and
[1:22:28] for us it's in a spiritual sense a
[1:22:32] spiritual application okay so how many
[1:22:36] how many you remember
[1:22:38] this you've seen all the Evol seen this
[1:22:40] how brother M talks about
[1:22:42] that what were they seven lunar
[1:22:47] eclipse not solar eclipse lunar
[1:22:51] eclipse that's different that has a
[1:22:54] different application you understand
[1:22:56] what I'm saying about you understand me
[1:22:59] what I'm saying there okay
[1:23:03] now October the 8th we had a lunar
[1:23:08] eclipse and on the
[1:23:11] 23d of October we're going to have a
[1:23:14] solar
[1:23:15] eclipse isn't that fun you know what
[1:23:17] October the
[1:23:20] 230th that's when brother brandham and
[1:23:23] sister brandham
[1:23:24] got married is that right is that wrong
[1:23:28] did I make a mistake
[1:23:30] there it's not a lunar eclipse it's a
[1:23:33] solar
[1:23:35] eclipse wow and what what is what does
[1:23:39] the Moon represent brother Bram said
[1:23:41] watch now listen to this okay brother
[1:23:43] Bram said what does the the Moon
[1:23:45] represent now watch the way brother Bram
[1:23:47] talks he says Revelations 12 he says
[1:23:50] that's that Orthodox Church that's
[1:23:53] Israel brother bam says that
[1:23:58] okay Revelations 12 the son top of her
[1:24:02] head and the moon under her feet is that
[1:24:06] right and as the the moon which
[1:24:08] represents the Law was fading away the
[1:24:11] sun was
[1:24:12] Rising but then brother bam says well
[1:24:14] who is that woman in Revelations 12 he
[1:24:16] says it's the Orthodox Church they asked
[1:24:18] him that question what is it it's
[1:24:21] Israel and then brother brandham also
[1:24:24] said say he also says that the moon
[1:24:27] represents the
[1:24:29] bride the moon the sun is Christ and the
[1:24:33] Moon is the church or the bride brother
[1:24:37] Bram says that see but you have to put
[1:24:40] everything in Balance how brother Bales
[1:24:42] because remember the Jews also had seven
[1:24:44] Church ages okay so it's a shadow it's a
[1:24:47] law the shadow okay and now we have the
[1:24:51] real thing okay under this under the
[1:24:53] Gentiles seven Church
[1:24:56] ages and the light is going coming on
[1:24:58] more and more and
[1:25:00] more so in four more days we're going to
[1:25:04] have a solar
[1:25:06] eclipse okay on October
[1:25:10] 23rd wow I wish I could sit down and
[1:25:13] tell you everything that I understand
[1:25:16] there maybe you think I'm crazy
[1:25:19] okay but it does mean something okay
[1:25:25] and it does have a spiritual application
[1:25:27] to it when that eclip happens what I
[1:25:30] understand it's it's it's going to be
[1:25:32] here United States United States will be
[1:25:33] able to see it okay I'm just going to
[1:25:36] skip all that and let me let me get into
[1:25:41] the message that I have today I'm going
[1:25:43] to skip all
[1:25:45] that it's short what I have it's not
[1:25:49] very much short and sweet
[1:25:54] the message today titled is standing in
[1:25:57] the
[1:25:58] breach amen you know brother man preach
[1:26:00] a message standing in the Gap remember
[1:26:03] that okay now I'm going to read you a a
[1:26:08] scripture first Revelations 5 and then
[1:26:11] just follow along with me tell me what
[1:26:13] you think Revelations 51 and I saw in
[1:26:17] the right hand of him that sat on the
[1:26:18] throne a book written within and a
[1:26:20] backside sealed with Seven Seals and I
[1:26:23] saw a string strong angel proclaiming
[1:26:25] with a loud voice who is worthy to open
[1:26:27] the book and to lose the seal thereof
[1:26:29] and no man in Heaven Nor in Earth
[1:26:30] neither under the Earth was able to open
[1:26:32] the book neither to look there on and I
[1:26:35] wept much because no man was found
[1:26:37] worthy to open and to read the book
[1:26:39] neither to look there on and one of the
[1:26:41] elders saith unto me weep not behold the
[1:26:44] light of the tribe of Judah the root of
[1:26:45] David has prevailed to open the book and
[1:26:47] to loose the Seven Seals thereof and I
[1:26:50] be behold and lo in the midst of the
[1:26:52] throne and the four beast and in the
[1:26:54] midst of the elders stood a lamb and
[1:26:56] they had been slain having seven horns
[1:26:58] and seven eyes which are the seven
[1:27:00] spirits of God sent forth unto all the
[1:27:02] world and they came and he came and took
[1:27:06] the book out of him and he came and took
[1:27:09] the book out of the right hand of him
[1:27:12] that sat upon the throne and when he had
[1:27:14] taken the book four beast and four 20
[1:27:17] Elders fell down fell down before the
[1:27:20] lamb having every one of them Harps and
[1:27:23] golden vials full of the orders which
[1:27:25] are the prayers of saints and they sang
[1:27:27] a new song saying thou are worthy to
[1:27:28] take the book to open the seal thereof
[1:27:31] for thou that for thou was slain and has
[1:27:34] redeemed us to the to God by the blood
[1:27:36] out of every Kindred tongue and people
[1:27:38] and nation and has made us unto God
[1:27:41] Kings and Priests and we shall reign on
[1:27:44] the
[1:27:45] earth we know that man foul in the
[1:27:48] garden of me garden of me man
[1:27:50] fell and were all lost amen
[1:27:55] and we're all going to
[1:27:57] hell but then one day we know God sent a
[1:28:01] lamb he died for us died on the cross
[1:28:04] and that's that's what we're seeing here
[1:28:08] okay in the Book of Revelations the
[1:28:10] fifth chapter The Book of Revelations is
[1:28:13] when John went because nobody was worthy
[1:28:15] to open the book or to even look upon
[1:28:17] thereof okay but then all of a sudden
[1:28:20] here comes the lamb and the lamb
[1:28:23] overcome
[1:28:25] he gave his life to redeem us and he
[1:28:28] took the book out of the hands of the
[1:28:32] devil to say like that because when Adam
[1:28:35] and Eve forfeit that book they forfeit
[1:28:37] it to him okay but then the lamb come
[1:28:40] here snatched it away from him he go
[1:28:42] I've got the book what is the book it's
[1:28:44] the book of redemption the book of
[1:28:46] everyone that is saved that has eternal
[1:28:49] life and that's a secret
[1:28:52] okay when was your name put on the
[1:28:54] Lamb's Book of Life before the
[1:28:55] foundation of the
[1:28:57] world wow that's awesome now the lamb
[1:29:00] has overcome and now the lamb the lamb
[1:29:04] has the book in his hands who Jesus
[1:29:07] Christ is that right that's what the
[1:29:10] Bible

[1:29:19] first we would ask you to be merciful to
[1:29:22] us pardon us of all of our transgression
[1:29:25] if we confess our wrongs and our little
[1:29:28] errors and our secret
[1:29:31] sins are unknown sins and we confess
[1:29:35] them also as

[1:31:36] here in 1963 64 65 maybe around there
[1:31:40] maybe me a year later whatever the
[1:31:42] Rapture should have taken place brother
[1:31:44] Bron went play 1977 the Rapture would
[1:31:46] should place right but brother brandham
[1:31:49] is praying here and interceding for the
[1:31:51] people and he says just a little longer
[1:31:54] be merciful to them a little longer if
[1:31:56] give them another chance and I say that
[1:31:58] today I don't care what you do in

[1:32:42] there's nothing wrong with that you know
[1:32:44] what's wrong to stay like that it's like
[1:32:47] when that prostitute came to Jesus she
[1:32:50] was a prostitute why she was she not a
[1:32:53] prostitute she was she had a lustful
[1:32:56] sexual demon on her and she went from
[1:33:00] one man to another man to another man to
[1:33:01] another one to another one right that
[1:33:04] wasn't the
[1:33:05] problem the problem is if she stayed
[1:33:08] like that but she repented and she
[1:33:11] recognized who Jesus was and that's all
[1:33:14] you have to do I don't care what you've

[1:34:19] generation and this generation is what
[1:34:22] 120 years you know they say 40 years is
[1:34:25] one generation brother brandham said it
[1:34:27] used to be 120 years with one generation
[1:34:30] and if you take that as it was in the
[1:34:33] days of Noah he preached 120
[1:34:36] years it's been 80 years
[1:34:39] now 80 years and we're going into the

[1:34:51] the math and figure it out 2013
[1:34:54] was the end of the second
[1:34:55] generation yes but there's one more
[1:34:58] generation you say oh we got another 40
[1:34:59] years no we
[1:35:09] don't you know you're going to have to
[1:35:10] forgive me brother
[1:35:13] sisters but I'm going to go over
[1:35:18] time now there's no doubt in our mind is
[1:35:22] there not one doubt God's going to do it
[1:35:24] you believe it everybody God's going to
[1:35:26] he's not going to leave anything undone
[1:35:30] he's going to do exactly what he asked
[1:35:31] him to do cuz he can do nothing else and
[1:35:34] remain
[1:35:36] God if we don't doubt he'll Grant to us
[1:35:39] now don't forget to pray for
[1:35:43] somebody who really needs prayer you all
[1:35:46] know who that is it's me yep brother
[1:35:50] Brandman is asking for prayer
[1:35:54] I'm the one that needs
[1:35:56] prayer standing in the
[1:35:58] [Music]
[1:36:00] breach standing in the bridge
[1:36:04] amen you know why I stand here today
[1:36:07] before the
[1:36:08] puppet because he stood in the
[1:36:11] bridge for me amen for you am a man yes
[1:36:16] a
[1:36:17] man a man Redeemed by the blood of the
[1:36:21] Lamb he was the first one to be
[1:36:26] adopted I'm going to say
[1:36:31] it the lamb holds the
[1:36:34] book but then the the the book was
[1:36:40] transferred the book was transferred to
[1:36:44] a man who is that man
[1:36:57] I've got all this here I'm not going to
[1:36:59] I'm not going to read
[1:37:03] that I die
[1:37:06] here and I believe
[1:37:10] this you know brother R preached a
[1:37:13] message the breach between the the seven
[1:37:15] Church ages brother you remember that
[1:37:18] the
[1:37:21] breach now we're going to turn to the
[1:37:24] fifth chapter now this is not the Seven
[1:37:26] Seals it is the breach between the
[1:37:28] church ages and the Seven
[1:37:31] Seals the
[1:37:33] breach
[1:37:37] between now there's also the six chapter
[1:37:39] and there was the fourth chapter rather
[1:37:41] Revelations and in that it it's kind of
[1:37:44] reveals something that would take place
[1:37:46] after the church is going up that the
[1:37:48] church goes up on the third chapter in
[1:37:50] Revelations and does not return until
[1:37:51] the 19th Chapter of Revelations there
[1:37:53] therefore the church misses the
[1:37:55] tribulation okay
[1:37:57] now now I'm going to read you a quote
[1:38:00] here I'm going to read the scripture
[1:38:02] forgive me Exodus 32:30 Exodus 32 write
[1:38:06] it down you go home read it and it came
[1:38:10] to pass on the tomorrow that Moses said
[1:38:11] unto the people he have sinned a great
[1:38:13] sin and now I will go up into the unto
[1:38:16] the Lord pre Adventure I shall make an
[1:38:18] atonement for your sin and Moses
[1:38:20] returned unto the Lord and said all this
[1:38:22] people have s a great sin and have made
[1:38:25] them gods of gold yet now if thou will
[1:38:29] forgive their sins in if not blot me I
[1:38:34] pray out of the book which thou has
[1:38:36] written Moses is pleading before God to
[1:38:41] blot out his
[1:38:43] name he stood before the people God he
[1:38:46] said wait a minute before you kill them
[1:38:49] kill
[1:38:51] me what a spirit
[1:38:55] do we ever do
[1:38:56] that and the Lord said unto Moses
[1:39:00] whosoever has sinned against me him will
[1:39:02] I B out out of my my book therefore now
[1:39:06] go and lead the people into the place
[1:39:07] which I have spoken unto thee behold my
[1:39:09] angels shall go before thee nevertheless
[1:39:11] in the in the day when I visit I will
[1:39:13] visit their sin upon

[1:45:27] say Lord the word that promised the word

[1:45:32] predestinated to these people back there
[1:45:34] before the foundation of world it's it's

[1:46:15] constantly praying for your kids and
[1:46:17] interceding for them who you William
[1:46:21] Bram no you
[1:46:23] you you should be praying for
[1:46:29] them you know now I haven't got
[1:46:32] much I haven't got much time now to say
[1:46:35] something but I want to make this
[1:46:36] statement now now remember about the
[1:46:38] squirrels all right that was puzzling
[1:46:42] scripture in my life that I could never
[1:46:44] understand and there was another one
[1:46:46] that puzzled me that was when Moses
[1:46:49] could tell God a better way than God
[1:46:51] know how to do things when Moses said
[1:46:54] the people will say your God was able to
[1:46:56] bring you out but not able to keep you
[1:47:00] and Moses threw himself in the
[1:47:03] breach wow see that puzzled brother
[1:47:06] brandham what puzzle me I couldn't
[1:47:08] understand how Moses could tell God a
[1:47:12] better
[1:47:13] way you know because God was going to
[1:47:15] come and just wipe them all out in the
[1:47:17] wrath of God but then Moses said wait a
[1:47:19] minute God wait a minute so Moses is
[1:47:22] telling God A Better
[1:47:24] Way have
[1:47:26] mercy and Moses threw himself in the
[1:47:29] brid for the people he says and there
[1:47:32] was another one that puzzled me that was
[1:47:34] when Moses could tell God a better way
[1:47:36] than God know how to do anything when
[1:47:39] Moses said the people will say your God
[1:47:40] was able to bring you out of Egypt but
[1:47:44] not able to keep you and Moses threw
[1:47:46] himself in the breach then later I found
[1:47:49] that that that that Moses that was
[1:47:51] Christ in Moses standing for the
[1:47:56] people after seeing all these Miracles
[1:47:58] and things God did for them they still

[1:49:43] world okay so there's other people
[1:49:46] interceding but they're only interceding
[1:49:48] because one man one man Jesus Christ
[1:49:50] stood on the breach amen for all of
[1:49:53] mankind of all humanity and said wait a
[1:49:56] minute God I know they did wrong but I
[1:49:59] am interceding I'm man standing in the
[1:50:01] brid for all of this people because they
[1:50:04] had their names written in the land book
[1:50:06] of life before the foundation of I don't
[1:50:08] care they're a a prostitute a wher
[1:50:11] what you are
[1:50:20] amen two more and I'm done
[1:50:24] talk about a jubilee talk about a time
[1:50:26] when the lamb walked forth listen to
[1:50:28] this see the book even sealed in heaven
[1:50:30] the Mysteries are you say is my name
[1:50:33] there I don't know I hope it is but if
[1:50:35] it is it was put on the book before the
[1:50:38] foundation of the world but the first
[1:50:40] thing that represents that Redemption
[1:50:42] come the lamb that had been slain from
[1:50:44] the foundation of the world and he took
[1:50:47] the book Glory opened the seals and tore
[1:50:50] off the seals and send it it down to the
[1:50:54] Earth to his seventh angel to reveal it
[1:50:58] to his people
[1:51:01] wow hallelujah
[1:51:05] hallelujah now who has the book of
[1:51:08] redemption in his hand Jesus
[1:51:12] no read that over again he took the book
[1:51:16] who the lamb opened the book tore off
[1:51:19] the seals and sent it down to the Earth
[1:51:22] to his seventh angel to reveal it to his
[1:51:27] people there you are so now the book is
[1:51:31] in the hands of the seventh angel
[1:51:36] messenger brother or sister if you can
[1:51:38] only see what kind of life I live I am
[1:51:40] no good I am a sinner I have this a bad
[1:51:43] habit I have this I have
[1:51:45] that I know that I know that I know I'm
[1:51:48] a sinner I know I'm no
[1:51:51] good but I can confess
[1:51:54] something that I believe that that's the
[1:51:56] only hope there is
[1:51:59] now people point you to Jesus Jesus
[1:52:03] Jesus but in the Bible it's promised
[1:52:05] that he would send a prophet a messenger
[1:52:08] seventh angel messenger and then he
[1:52:10] would take that book the lamp book of
[1:52:12] love and hand it over to the seventh
[1:52:15] angel
[1:52:16] messenger so now he has it in his hands
[1:52:21] now he knows know whose name he
[1:52:26] knows not Jesus a
[1:52:30] man William Mary and brandham knows
[1:52:33] whose name is in the Lamb's Book of Life
[1:52:36] yeah she was a yeah he was a
[1:52:39] prostitute yeah he was a liar he was a
[1:52:42] drunk he was this yeah he was that but
[1:52:44] then the
[1:52:46] lamb interceded for that person for the
[1:52:50] lamb has overcome
[1:52:53] you don't overcome I don't overcome he
[1:52:55] overcome for us so my whole trust all my

[1:53:05] capacity I totally deposited at the feet
[1:53:10] of that seventh angel
[1:53:14] messenger amen there you are there you

[2:06:14] time the Bible tells us

[2:06:29] right
[2:06:31] now the word has went

[2:07:01] [Music]
[2:07:06] hearts I believe that anything could
[2:07:09] happen right

[2:07:22] Gyra the one that created the heavens
[2:07:25] and the Earth the one who steer who

[2:07:35] us that it was his very faith that
[2:07:38] created that thing in
[2:07:40] Sarah that's what resides inside our
[2:07:43] hearts right
[2:07:44] now that faith that can move mountains
[2:07:49] that faith that can that can bring
[2:07:50] anything into existence he's our father
[2:07:55] he's the Creator he's the one who
[2:07:57] promised it it's not us who promised it
[2:08:00] it's
[2:08:01] [Music]
