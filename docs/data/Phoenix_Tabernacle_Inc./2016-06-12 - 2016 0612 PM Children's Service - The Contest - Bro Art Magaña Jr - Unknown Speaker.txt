of William branam we're in Book two the young Man in his desperation we're starting chapter 23 we're Going To we're going to actually read The first part of that chapter Tonight before gets started um just a quick comment um This chapter is entitled struggling Back it covers the years of 1937 to 1939 and as have we've been as we've been taught in the message each and Every One of Us have a purpose God has a purpose for Us and at some Point in Our Life It's revealed to Us What Our specific Place is in god's Kingdom brother brannon was discovering this as he was recovering as You remember from The Last of the tragedies That Had befallen him he struggled to find meaning in it and like many of Us the best Place to turn When we're in those types of Times in Our Life is to scripture and brother Brandon did Just that before we get started I also want to um Let everyone know um this particular chapter does include some scripture Which I find very um uplifting and after the recent chapters we've been through in this Book and at this Point in brother brennon Life He's closing in on 30 years old so those of Us young and young at Heart Take Heart in this that your purpose for in your life that God has for you It's a progressive revelation and so without further do we'll get started River Had indeed measured 20 Spring stre during the 1937 flood exactly as the Angel Had shown William branom it would brandom tabernacle Which was not Far from Spring Street Had also received a baptism Rising flood water Had Broken out the Windows floating Everything inside that was not fastened down including the pulpit and pews When The muddy River Finally receded the pew came down crisscross and topsy turvy but the pulpit settled down in Almost ex spot Where it belonged Still upright and Still facing The congregation the Night before the flood Bill Had left his Bible lying open on top of the pulpet when he Finally got Back to survey the damage he Found that his Bible was right Where he Had left it Still Open to the same page Bill took this as a Sign from God even though the outer circumstances of his Life were in disarray the word of God that he preach remained Ever true and stable that Was encouraging and Bill needed Every ounce of encouragement he could get to help him endure his Life he Just could not get over losing his wife and his daughter he felt like he was serving a Prison sentence with no hope of parole sadness ped him in like the Bars of a cell loneliness watched him like a Prison guard and hopelessness like a stern warden seemed to regulate his Every move the seemed Almost too heavy to Bear sometimes he squeezed comfort from his Dream of hope and Sharon in heaven he knew It was a Dream Because he Had fallen asleep visions happened when he was wide awake but it Had been such a memorable Dream so vivid down to the grain of the Wood on the Prairie schooner and the footprints left by his boots in the Sand although it seemed to be so full of meaning as though God Had Wanted to Tell him many Things some Point seemed obvious the Broken Wagon Wheel surely represented his Broken family and It was true that hope and Sharon were Now in a better Place than Earth but other symbols were not so Clear Why Was the Dream set in the West was there Any significance in the setting sun most puzzling of all What did hope mean when She said he was wearing himself out praying for the sick for these questions he could find no suitable answers Bill drew his greatest strength from the Bible he read in romans 828 Where the apostle Paul said and We know that all things work Together for The Good to them that Love God to them Who are called according to his purpose Bill struggled to believe that but It was so hard to see What possible good could come from losing his wife and daughter he marked John 14 Where Jesus said Let not your Heart be troubled You believe in God and believe also in me in my father's house are many manions I go to prepare a Place for you I will come Again and receive you unto Myself Let not Your Heart be troubled neither Let It Be afraid Bill tried to practice this advice but his Heart was often troubled Just the same although he continued to preach in his Church he Had Lost much of his former Energy and Drive he cared Just as much about the people but somehow he did not feel right with the lord whenever he prayed he could Never quite Touch the throne of God the way he Had previously he felt miserable his mother Still lived just a few blocks away from him after the Death of Charles senor She Had turned her home into a boarding House Which produced a steady though modest means of Support each day ella would Cook Breakfast and supper for her patrons Bill frequently by in the Evening for supper One night While he helped his mother Clear dirty J from the table ella asked him What he thought about the new Bridge they were building Over The H River between Louisville Kentucky and jeffersonville Indiana doesn't it strike you as familiar She ask ella nodded strange but somehow it does Almost like I remember it from somewhere ella nodded One Day years ago you came running into the house all exciting babbling about seeing a Bridge Where there was no Bridge at First I thought It was all malarkey but then I got to wondering so I wrote It Down and tucked it away She handed him a folded Piece of Yellow paper Bill knew what it said before he read it his boyhood Memory came rushing back he remembered the Apple Tree The Game of marbles the peculiar feeling that came over him he recalled How The River Had suddenly seemed closer and How the Bridge Had rapidly formed Over The water going Together Piece by Piece until that One girder High in the middle broke free and came crashing down he opened The Old scrap of paper and read his mother's scroll then he thought about the new Bridge Under construction there It was it Had happened Just the way he Had seen it when he was a boy mama What do you think it means She shrugged How should I know but Billy Over The years I've often wondered if you were born for a special purpose in Life I Still think that might be so remembering that boyhood Vision his First Vision and Now realizing it Had been fulfilled Bill wondered the same Thing could his Life be really moving toward some Unique purpose currently his Life felt so Dry so empty so devoid of meaning that It was hard to Imagine How God could use him for anything special but he could Never forget that s Boy listening in terror as a Deep voice spoke to him out of a whirlwind in a tree telling him Don't ever drink or Smoke or defile your body in Any way there Will be a work for you to do when you get older is that Why God would not Let him Die yet was there Still something more For him To accomplish a Tiny flame of hope flickered within his breast on september 1 1939 adolf Hitler ordered his troops to invade poland two days later France and Great Britain declared War on Germany the french immediately attacked Across the rine River along their common Border with Germany but Had difficulty penetrating the stiff German defenses meanwhile poland's caly Core were hopelessly outmatched by germany's mechanicz divisions after Mere 18 days of disastrous fighting poland's government and Military command fled to bordering romania from that Point polish collaps rapidly allowing Germany to concentrate her Energy on the french invasion although France Had hasly retreated from German soil it seemed obvious to most political analyzers that War in europe instead of Being over was Just beginning like everyone Else Who Had access to a radio or newspapers William branam followed this european drama with serious attention however his interest in the War sprang from a completely different perspective this was What he Had seen in june of 1933 when he fell into a trance and watched Seven events roll out before him in a panoramic Vision of the future It was uncanny What kind of Power allowed him to see events before they happened and For what purpose there was that Word Again purpose Maybe God really did have a significant purpose plan for his life If so Why didn't it manifest itself more clearly at this in his thoughts bill's Mind would inevitably drift back to his encounter with the Pentecostal people at mishawaka Indiana two years earlier Bill knew he Had missed god's plan for his life when he Had turned down Those invitations from Pentecostal ministers to evangelize out among their churches How could he get Back into the Will of God Of course he could simply Start visiting Pentecostal churches in hope that some might ask him to preach for them but there was Still One nagging question like a Road block that kept him from following such a Direct rout the question about the gifts of the Holy Spirit specifically the question about Tong and interpretation of Tong by Now Bill felt convinced that tongs and the interpretation of tongs were both genuine gifts of the Spirit of God the Bible seemed Clear Enough on that Point What troubled Bill was his experience at mishawaka with Those two men Who Had been especially active in expressing the gifts of Tong in their interpretations both men Had demonstrated the same powerful manifestations of the Spirit of God in the church service but later When Bill Had talked to each Man Alone he Had seen Straight into their personal lives although One of the men was altogether a dedicated Christian the other Man was absolutely a hypocrite bill knew It was the Truth divisions Never Lied This is What bothered him about the whole Pentecostal idea of allowing gifts of the Spirit to operate openly in Church meetings If that was really the Spirit of God falling in that Pentecostal meeting at mishawaka How could the Spirit of God bless that flagrant hypocrite it did not seem likely but could the Spirit of satan produce the works of God that also seemed doubtful then It was possible that both Spirits could be at work in the same meeting such an idea presented difficulties If Spirit of God and the Spirit of satan produced the same results How can anyone Ever know what was true this puzzle Had troubled him many Times Over The Last two years but now after seeing his Vision of War in europe become a reality Bill felt a renewed urgency to find an answer so that he could put his mistake behind him and Start Again down the path toward Whatever Destiny God Had in Mind God bless you [Aplausos] se pueden poner de pie juntamente conmigo la vuelta y saluda a su hermano le dice Dios le bendiga le

opuesta caliente arriba feliz sucio vacío usted tien las mismas palabras que tengo aquí fuerte [Música] enfermo están al 100% vieron mis notas creo que las vieron rico noche oscuro bueno está la última [Música] Dios muchas respuestas que son la misma Is there ail y hay un si hay un y los conocemos como el otro nombre que escuché Satanás y él viene a nosotros él viene a nuestras Mentes a nuestros pensamientos y algo muy importante que les Quiero compartir él no es nuestro amigo él está en contra de nosotros él es nuestro enemigo les quiero dar otra situación el viernes cuando hablé a los jóvenes me gusta usar muchos ejemplos Entonces esta práctica va a ser nada más que ejemplos le voy a pedir a alguien cuando yo les de esta pregunta si serían lo suficiente valiente venir acá y responderme entonces voy a dejar que uno los niños lo haga aquí está la pregunta y la situación estamos aquí en la iglesia yed está caminando allí afuera y y lo vamos a hacer muy interesante usted ve en el piso un iPad un IP está bien no más Usted lo ve Ahora usted lo levanta y ahora aquí está la pregunta qué es lo que usted hace con eso y hay alguien que se quiere levantar y quiere compartir es lo que harían con ell creo que acá tenemos alguien queos prender este micrófono es lo que haces Yo preguntar de es algo más buena respuesta y tengo una segunda parte de esa pregunta esa respuesta es la cosa correcta de hacer una buena cosa de hacer recuerda el juego del opuesto tenemos la cosa buena de hacer pero cuando hay un arriba hay un debajo cuando hay un Bueno hay mal ahora que estás aquí Te quiero preguntar qué sería la cosa equivocada de hacer de quedarse con ella de esconderlo muy rápido ponerlo en tu bolsillo si quedaría en tu bolsillo llevatelo a casa y luego después mirarlo verdad Muchas gracias por su [Aplausos] ayuda ahora la pregunta es de dónde vino ese mal pensamiento dónde vino esa idea equivocada de de esconderla y llevándola por ti mismo estar solo con ello hermanos y hermanas eso es de Satanás eso es del y eso lo que queremos llamar en esta tarde la contienda y la contienda sucede en cada uno de los que estamos aquí en este edici ha cuando Ed vi correctamente el hermano dice más de estos problemas son dirigidos en su camino esto es de cada cristiano que tiene esta batalla y es una escogencia la decisi de hacer cosa correa incorrecta Pero por supuesto tenemos buenos padres padres que atienden a sus niños y que son amorosos que nos traen a la escuela dominical al servicio de los niños de aprender Y siempre hacer las cosas correctas y sabed cuando mayor va olvar de estas cosas usted nunca se va a olvidar de estas cosas la contienda también el hermano brs dice que en este día es maligno más que en cualquier otro tiempo y los poderes de Satanás son difíciles de pelear en contra de ell esas decisiones correctas y como un cristiano yo me he preguntado a m mismo Cómo es que me defiendo en contra de estos pensamientos en contra de estas potestades las tentaciones las malas ideas los pensamientos errados y a veces cuando estamos fuera de la iglesia oyos cosas diferentes de lo que oimos en aquí de cuál manera voy voy de la manera que me dicen mis amigos de lo que oigo en la escuela voy a ir con lo que oigo los domingos qué Estoy escuchando de mis padres y para ver si estoy en la misma página con todos los demás Hay un niño un hombre joven una niña le gustaría subir yc es la manera que usted sei en contra de estos pensamientos encantaría escuchar eso Si alguien le gustaría venir Si no seguiros adelante está bien Aquí tengo unas cosas unas prendas y dentro de esa bolsa yo tengo unas armas y aquí está una está bien y para qué se usan las armas para protegerte para la defensa a m me gusta sacar esta por primero porque esta sabemos que le pertenece a a una niña y estas niñas se necesitan protegerse a sí mismas y a veces son más valientes que nosotros los muchachos está bien pero es Es la verdad necesitamos armas para defendernos cuando estamos en problemas y voy a sacar más armas y Lu voy a hacer la pregunta si usted me diría Qué tipo de persona usa Estas armas está bien Aquí está otra arma quién usaría esta arma cualquiera usar esta ara Un indio verdad para cazar su comida proteger su familia una arma que un indio usaría los vaqueros y los indios un poco más moderno no el nombre de la muchacha era arma que ahora voy a intentar otra usara este tipo de arma a veo Sam ya s que le parezco una espada de ninja tal de un caballero é usa una espada uno de los Caballeros de la mesa del Rey Arturo para defenderte una arma ahora una vez una otra Pero quién usaría este esta arma una arma que un J usa para defenderse bueno sabe usted que como cristianos nosotros tenemos armas nosotros tenemos armas que usamos para defendernos en contra del enemigo Y quién es nuestro enemigo es nuestro hermano y hermana que está a nuestro lado no es Satanás esos diablos esos pensamientos Entonces como un cristiano Dios nos está dando armas para defendernos en contra de ellos y yo no quiero mencionar tres cosas que armas más grandes en el mundo que Dios ha puesto en nuestras manos de la oración Biblia la palabra de Dios sus promesas y hemos escuchado de estas verdad Pero usted pensado de estas como armas son armas y Dios nos las ha dado y con esas tres armas nuestro gran y gran conquistador derrotó a Satanás y todos sus poderes y están en nuestras manos y quién es nuestro gran y poderoso conquistador el señor Jesucristo y yo tengo una tarea para cada uno de ustedes y lamento que también se voy a dar a los padres sied Jesucristo derrotó a Satanás con esas tres armas Yo pienso que usted debería ir con sus padres y preguntarles Cómo es que el señor Jesucristo derrotó a Satanás con esas tres armas Yo pienso que sería una buena conversación de tener bien Yo sé que en la Ramada hay un una una una cadena de tiempo del hermano bram y como dije está en la Ramada dibujos maravillosos fotos maravillosas de las diferentes etapas de la vida del hermano bran y la escuela dominical loer en el campamento de la juventud y son muy interesantes yo disfruté de verlas Cuando la vi la semana [Música] pasada y usted si le gustaría yo le sugiero que vaya después de servicio las vea y luego el hermano Hol el trabajo maravilloso que él hace de hablar del hermano branam a nosotros de la historia de su vida en los libros sobrenaturales Entonces yo no más quiero dar unos cuantos ejemplos del amor siendo desplegado por el hermano branam recuerde es una de las armas más grandiosas que tenemos en nuestras manos Ahora yo no puedo contar no puedo decir un cuento como el hermano bran Entonces vamos a dejar que él lo diga Pero antes de hacer eso le quiero dar la escena y la primera parte es que él brevemente habla de su experiencia con un hombre que quería atacarlo a él que quería matar el hermano branam é continúa en la historia de un testimonio que él estaba en el patio de atrás cortando su pasto y él pegó una caja y dentro de esta caja era muchas abejas y se empezaron a emocionar y la siguiente parte es cuando el hermano branam tiene el encuentro con el toro y es cuando voy a dejar que hermano bram diga la historia si pueden prender este micrófono Now this seem Can you hear that [Música] be cover ang you but I am God servant And I am praying and minister to his people so I Haven got time to play with you at this Time So You Rush chr [Música] min circl [Aplausos] Sor anim runin Feet of Kill col Man Farm months that And I said your creator j [Música] the serpent grabbed him through the hand Now If he said Oh my me the quicker some serum it might hurt him but he [Música] char That's right is that voice Just wonderful to no es maravilloso escuchar esa voz el hermano aquí le va a interpretar las abejas me cubrieron a todo mi alrededor y en vez de estar asustado yo tuve amor por esas abispas ahora Eso suena ridículo pero es la verdad algo sucedió y yo pensé Pobrecitos tal vez estaban tomando una siesta y yo fui y los disturb y les pegué así y ellos En verdad estaban en serio ellos estaban al todo mi alrededor y yo detuve mi máquina de cortar el pasto y dije lo lamento mis pequeños amigos que los molesté y lo siento yo soy el siervo de Dios Y con razón ustedes están enojados conmigo porque los he disturb pero yo soy el siervo de Dios Y estoy orando y ministrando a su pueblo Entonces no tengo tiempo para estar jugando con ustedes en este momento Entonces ustedes Apúrese y regresen en el nombre del señor Jesús y entren a su caja y mi mi Biblia está aquí como ministro cristiano y Dios conoce mi corazón esas esas abejas me rodearon y como dos círculos más y se alinearon uno por uno y regresaron a su caja y eso es verdad un día allá en el gran rancho ahora lo tienen Cuántos tienen alineado quieren más necesitan más está bien tráiganme los los últimos cuatro dónde es que dejamos 15 Está bien tráiganme hasta 20 ent Ah dejen que se alíen ahí si es que desean hasta el 20 ahora note el gran toro corrió en el en el campo un día para quitarme la vida y ahí yo estaba y no había manera de que yo me podía escapar de él y en vez de asustarme me dio lástima por el animal y él corrió hacia unos pies enfrente de mí él acaba de matar un hombre de color allá en el rancho de berks hace dos meses y yo dije tu creador es mi amoroso Salvador y yo no te estoy molestando Yo estoy en una misión de cruzar este campo y ahora en el nombre de nuestro creador el Señor Jesús tu ve allá y acuéstate debajo de ese árbol y él corrió hasta llegar cinco pies enfrente de mí se detuvo mi se miró tan cansado y exhausto él miró hacia la derecha la izquierda ierda se dio La media vuelta y caminó y se acostó debajo del árbol Eso es correcto me dio lástima por él y le amé eso es exactamente correcto ahora Eso suena ridículo pero déjame decirle hermano que cuando San Pablo el apóstol cuando la serpiente lo agarró y lo mordió en la mano él lo pudo decir Oh Agárrame la la idona o la medicina eso Tal vez le había dolido Pero él esta tan cargado con el espíritu santo que él no más lo miró sin estar asustado Y no más lo sacudió hasta que fue echado al fuego y siguió la razón que compartí esa parte yo creo que o yo siento que el hermano branam es nuestro ejemplo aquí en la tierra él hizo esas cosas imposibles pero no era el hombre pero sino Dios en el hombre y él es hijo del rey y nosotros somos hijos del rey y nosotros tenemos esa misma habilidad como el hermano branam de hacer algo tan loco así como lo dijo é para disculparse con una con un montón de abejas enojadas decirle lo siento y ellos Sencillamente no más regresaron a lo que estaban haciendo antes qué tan loco es eso verdad Pero sucedió él es nuestro ejemplo y yo creo que el mismo Espíritu Santo en ese hombre está en nosotros y nosotros tenemos eso también la victoria a través del señor Jesucristo una más y cerraré quiero hablar sobre la oración el poder de la oración her atrás me recuerdo trabajando con con hera y hermana Romero gente maravillosa cristianos y era un honor para m para estar con ellos y no s si ustedes sepan pero el hermano estaba muy enfermo el lo tenía que no lo soltaba la fuerza de nuestro señor Jesús y no solamente esa fuerza del espíritu santo pero la oración de su mamá de esta iglesia de nuestros Santos esos Guerreros de la oración que tenemos viéndolo ahí es exactamente la misma cosa que oimos del hermano br tal vez pensamos que esto es un cuento de historia Esto aconteció hace 60 50 años y lo siempre lo oyos el señor Jesucristo mismo Ayer hoy por todos los siglos ahora est el hermano l estaba enfermo el año pasado este año estamos viviendo en la presencia El poder del señor Aún es el mismo tenemos la fe y sabemos que es más fuerte que el espíritu que está en el mundo eso es lo que nos dice la palabra la tercera parte nos da la fuerza esa fuerza para seguir adelante y nosotros no sabemos cómo es que vamos a continuar usted sabe lo que traerá mañana no tenemos idea hablé con de esto a los jóvenes el viernes También los niños en el mar rojo ellos estaban fuera de Egipto estaban cara a cara con el mar rojo y detrás de ellos los egipcios estaban viniendo a matarlos y suena un poco como hoy no tenemos cosas difíciles delante de nosotros que tenemos que encarar el testimonio del él lo tenía que encarar Y cómo es que iba a salir de eso ent cuando eso sucedió con los hijos de Israel el hermano Brown dice todo lo que todo lo que ellos hicieron y dice Señor yo creo en ti no sé cómo me vas a sacar de esto y saben qué Qué sucedió él abrió el mar rojo Cómo es que lo hizo saben qué no es para que entendamos nosotros no es para que sepamos es el negocio de Dios de abrir el mar rojo Qué difícil es eso de abrir Ese mar el hermano me dio un ejemplo allí atrás pudiera levantar a todos los millones arriba del mar Pero la palabra nos dice de seguir caminando adelante si se puede poner de pie mi tiempo ya se ha acabado pued inar rostr para que oremos señor padre celestial damos gracias señor por todo lo que haces por nosotros por siempre cuidar de nosotros por dar tus hijos lo mejor señor siento que yo tengo lo mejor [Música]
