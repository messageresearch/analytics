[33:01] uh this evening I would like to speak
[33:03] this that I like this message that when
[33:05] when the uh Prophet preached
[33:08] it he called it a conference with
[33:11] God and we will call this St the same
[33:15] way the scripture that we
[33:20] read I find something here I like to
[33:22] highlight
[33:25] that here the ones that's making that
[33:27] call
[33:29] is the
[33:30] Lord he's telling his
[33:36] people he he's not telling this to
[33:38] someone he doesn't know he's telling his
[33:41] people his people
[33:44] specially he's calling to have a
[33:48] dialogue a small
[33:52] talk says come
[33:56] now and let reason
[34:00] together I want us to be you know to be
[34:03] up to
[34:05] dat we want to fix
[34:08] ourselves we want things to go forward
[34:10] the right
[34:11] way now he comes and tells us
[34:15] this and I want to tell
[34:17] you what is a
[34:21] conference a conference is a
[34:23] dialogue Small
[34:26] Talk where uh
[34:28] things are
[34:30] discussed things that required that are
[34:32] of utmost
[34:35] importance it's so important that they
[34:38] need to be talked
[34:40] about to find a solution to those
[34:45] dilemas now this is this is done when
[34:47] there is a
[34:49] crisis or a problem
[34:55] arises usually the nations of the world
[34:57] call the conference
[34:59] immediately to talk about certain
[35:06] problem because that problem is
[35:08] obviously caught that
[35:09] attention and it has to be dealt
[35:14] with and that's the reason why a
[35:16] conference is
[35:19] called now where do these conferences
[35:21] take
[35:23] place usually it's in a quiet
[35:26] place
[35:29] they choose a certain
[35:36] place where there's nothing that can be
[35:38] distracting or interrupt that
[35:41] conference usually you find a peaceful
[35:44] place where they can
[35:47] relax for them that that they don't have
[35:49] any problems around
[35:52] them and they can have an open dialogue
[35:54] about this problem am
[35:56] amen
[35:58] those places that's that's where the
[36:00] these conferences take
[36:03] place now the people that call these
[36:08] conferences usually are the great
[36:13] leaders people that have a a reputable
[36:16] uh
[36:19] ranking they have this charge and they
[36:21] looking for a
[36:23] solution to solve this
[36:26] problem
[36:29] these are the people that usually look
[36:30] for solutions to a
[36:35] problem and usually people hope for
[36:37] these
[36:40] people that they may solve the crisis
[36:42] that arises at a certain
[36:45] place now I want us to kind of go back a
[36:47] little
[36:49] bit and just kind of bear with me for a
[36:54] moment so that I can transmit to you
[36:56] what the Lord has placed in my
[36:58] heart now here's the
[37:01] Lord speaking calling to a
[37:04] conference but now he's doing it
[37:07] individually because he has seen he
[37:12] knows that a problem has
[37:16] arisen there's a crisis in the the L
[37:20] life of the
[37:21] people there is pressure among the
[37:25] people there are situations that a great
[37:28] adversity and the Lord knows
[37:31] that so he calls to his people and you
[37:35] know
[37:37] what there is a crisis there is a
[37:42] problem let us talk about
[37:46] this now when he talks about
[37:49] this if you read the
[37:53] scripture he's making that invitation to
[37:55] a
[37:56] conference
[37:58] to have a dialogue a
[38:01] talk and when he says let us reason
[38:05] together let us reason
[38:08] together look if your sins and my
[38:11] sins my sins are included there as
[38:15] well if there were a
[38:18] Scarlet but if you speak with
[38:22] me they will be white as
[38:25] snow if they were crimson
[38:29] if they were Crimson as
[38:31] crimon they'll be white as
[38:36] wool so when we hear that
[38:39] invitation that the Lord Our
[38:44] God he's calling us to a conference
[38:48] individually we have to have talk talk
[38:51] with
[38:52] him when you come before the
[38:56] Lord you never going to astonish
[39:01] him you're never going to tell him
[39:02] something that he does not know he
[39:05] already knows
[39:06] everything he knows
[39:09] exactly what your problem may
[39:12] be or which ones are you many
[39:15] problems what is it that troubles
[39:19] you what perturbs you what bothers you
[39:23] he knows that
[39:26] already when come before me to have that
[39:28] dialogue and the
[39:30] conference you will never surprise God
[39:33] he already knows
[39:35] this what he wants from
[39:38] us is for us to be
[39:40] honest let us be
[39:42] sincere and tell him
[39:46] Lord I have this
[39:49] problem I know I should be this
[39:52] way but I'm like
[39:55] this and I don't want to be like this
[39:58] anymore I want you to help
[40:00] me there's a
[40:02] crisis the Lord knows this
[40:06] already the problem that we are facing
[40:09] he already knows
[40:10] it he will never be surprised amen he
[40:15] already knows
[40:16] this so why are we having the
[40:19] conference because he wants for
[40:24] us as an individual as a child of God
[40:29] to have that
[40:32] trust that we will find a solution to
[40:34] the
[40:36] problem putting the
[40:38] burdens those problems in his hands
[40:43] amen and for him to take
[40:47] control of each one of our
[40:51] adversities and each one of our
[40:54] problems he will take care of it
[40:59] we must do what we what we need to
[41:02] do like in a service like
[41:05] this did you
[41:10] know that if our spiritual eyes were to
[41:12] be
[41:13] [Applause]
[41:15] open this place is full of angels from
[41:19] God because the Holy Ghost is
[41:24] here but there's many people who do not
[41:26] believe this
[41:28] because they can't feel
[41:29] it but he is
[41:32] here he is faithful to his
[41:36] word even if it was just one
[41:38] person even if the church is
[41:41] empty with only one
[41:44] person surrender to
[41:46] God God comes
[41:49] down he is
[41:51] faithful he does not
[41:53] change he's here to help his people and
[41:57] he's calling us to that
[41:59] conference and that is the
[42:03] reason why in the midst of a tremendous
[42:08] service you're going to find two people
[42:10] sitting in the same place in the same
[42:13] church in the same
[42:15] service listening the same
[42:18] sermon the same
[42:20] preaching and one
[42:23] person can be completely
[42:26] blessed
[42:28] and the other one would not understand
[42:29] absolutely
[42:30] nothing do you know
[42:32] why the
[42:35] difference it's for
[42:38] believers why are you coming what are
[42:40] you searching for
[42:42] today and that's what you shall
[42:45] find my brother I was there in that
[42:48] service I didn't feel
[42:50] anything and the other
[42:53] person he was filled with the Holy Ghost
[42:58] I want you to
[42:59] understand that the Holy
[43:03] Ghost is for all of those who desire it
[43:07] if you want
[43:08] it it is for
[43:10] you if you need a new
[43:13] birth that is for
[43:16] you but we have to and we have to search
[43:21] out what is what that person
[43:24] did so that when they found themselves
[43:26] in this place
[43:28] they were able to receive that
[43:31] blessing and that is why
[43:33] God calls to that
[43:35] conference let me tell you one thing the
[43:39] Lord he is faithful to forgive
[43:43] us you know
[43:46] what there's one thing I want you to
[43:51] understand there is absolutely nothing
[43:53] that we can
[43:54] do for God to love us even more I would
[43:58] say it once
[44:00] again there's nothing that you and I can
[44:03] do we can make God love us even
[44:07] more let me tell you one
[44:09] thing the love of God is
[44:14] perfect he loves you in a way that you
[44:16] cannot understand
[44:18] it and he loves all of us the same way
[44:22] his love is
[44:23] perfect he can't love us anymore because
[44:27] his love is perfect there is nothing
[44:31] that we can do for him to love us even
[44:35] more but one thing we can
[44:39] do how much more can we love
[44:42] God that makes the
[44:44] difference when you love God even
[44:48] more you will be able to enjoy the love
[44:50] of God even
[44:51] more because the love of God is
[44:54] perfect his love does not change
[44:58] and he's given to his
[45:01] children and he wants to tell his
[45:03] children I love
[45:06] you oh but I have done this I've gone
[45:08] through
[45:09] this let me tell you once
[45:12] again God he knows
[45:16] this and he knows what you
[45:19] want and he wants for you to tell him
[45:22] for it to come out of your mouth
[45:25] or because through the mouth comes
[45:28] confession for your
[45:31] salvation we have to speak
[45:33] it because when you speak it when I
[45:37] speak it I say Lord I need
[45:41] you look as a
[45:44] minister yes we need the
[45:47] Lord who told you the minister don't
[45:49] have any
[45:51] problems who told you that the minister
[45:53] do not go through
[45:55] defeat maybe they're the ones that
[45:57] suffer the
[45:59] most but blessed be the name of the
[46:02] Lord that he will forget
[46:05] every he will love us in such a
[46:08] way that he said in his
[46:11] word that he will never leave us
[46:17] alone you go with your family with your
[46:20] parents go with your
[46:23] friends no matter who you are
[46:25] with you know that you are
[46:29] alone no one can understand
[46:31] you but the Lord said in his
[46:35] word that he will not leave us
[46:37] fatherless he will not leave us
[46:40] alone because he he went through through
[46:43] through
[46:45] loneliness he went to the Cross as a
[46:49] man as a
[46:51] failure as a
[46:53] nobody he came to the cross
[46:57] dressing
[47:00] humbleness willing to let himself you
[47:02] know do whatever they want with them he
[47:05] did for that love for
[47:07] us and when he was nailed to that
[47:11] cross he was by
[47:13] himself there was a lot of
[47:15] people there was people around him but
[47:17] he was by himself maybe you feel like
[47:20] that
[47:21] today you see people around
[47:24] you but you feel alone
[47:28] and when when Jesus was SP like
[47:31] that he said these beautiful
[47:39] words my God my
[47:42] God why hast Thou forsaken me I have
[47:46] done so many things and you have
[47:48] forsaken
[47:50] me lying lying as a
[47:53] lamb lying as a lamb
[47:57] because he was the perfect
[48:01] lamb the most precious being among the
[48:05] Earth the the Masterpiece of God the
[48:09] greatest thing from
[48:11] God he became
[48:13] flesh he present himself before
[48:16] us and he died for each one of
[48:19] us for him to understand
[48:23] us for to be like
[48:25] us and when you tell
[48:28] him Lord I feel so
[48:31] alone he he's going to come with
[48:34] you remember my word he will tell
[48:37] you you will never be
[48:40] alone because I made you the
[48:43] promise that I will be with
[48:46] you and even in you until the end of the
[48:51] world blessed be the name of the Lord do
[48:54] you know
[48:55] why doesn't
[48:57] matter what you going
[49:00] through what you going
[49:02] through what no matter what the problem
[49:05] is speak it and when you speak
[49:09] it say Lord this is my
[49:12] problem he already knows it and when you
[49:16] speak it just say
[49:19] Lord I believe that
[49:22] you have
[49:25] control do you know
[49:28] why cuz that's what the Lord
[49:31] wants we want to tell
[49:34] him why we don't have the success in the
[49:37] service we came in and we live the same
[49:40] way because we have not prepared
[49:43] ourselves the Lord
[49:46] says I want to have a conference with
[49:49] you I want to have a
[49:52] dialogue when was the last
[49:55] time that you yourself in the room and
[49:59] pray with
[50:01] me when was the last
[50:03] time that you felt
[50:07] pain and you asked
[50:10] forgiveness when was the last
[50:12] time that you felt
[50:15] sick and you asked
[50:18] me on the contrary you
[50:20] complained you begin to
[50:23] Grumble when was the last time
[50:27] that you pour out your
[50:29] heart and you thank me for everything
[50:32] that you
[50:33] have when was the last
[50:36] time that you
[50:38] appreciated one more day in your
[50:42] life when was the last
[50:44] time that you placed yourself in my
[50:47] hands when you were on your way to
[50:50] work and you said Lord be your will be
[50:53] done and what was the last time
[50:57] that you went through a
[50:59] problem and no matter what the situation
[51:03] was you looked up to heaven and say
[51:05] thank
[51:06] you when was the last time that you were
[51:10] sick and you felt that
[51:13] pain and you were able to
[51:16] overcome and you say Thank You Lord it
[51:19] doesn't
[51:20] matter what you're going
[51:24] through this is not about feelings
[51:28] it's based in
[51:29] faith by the grace of
[51:32] God this is for
[51:34] believers if you believe
[51:37] it doesn't matter what you're going
[51:40] through why are you going

[52:17] the many tapes that you have in in your

[52:22] time that you've set a apart a time for
[52:25] me

[1:17:42] Jesus that can they can be washed white
[1:17:44] as snow Lord
[1:17:46] father some of us who are maybe in that

[1:19:29] Lord just let go and let
[1:19:32] God to let him take over your
[1:19:36] life surrender all that you

[1:19:42] thoughts give up your ways to give up
[1:19:45] the thinking that you have that you you
[1:19:47] believe that's that that's the right way
[1:19:48] to
