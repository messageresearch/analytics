Lord for that and to each one of you God bless you we like to thank the musicians for the beautiful atmosphere that they have created for this service we want to speak a little bit on the word of God this evening we won't take long as something that is in our heart trusting in God that may he help you and as as we leave this place may we come out better that is Our intention that those who are here we can draw n to God uh we feel very happy in a way for the grace and the mercy of God let us read the word it never changes for us it has been a great blessing we find our scripture in Isaiah 1 verse 18 and the word god reach us I will ask you a great thing you please stand to honor the word please and then we will be praying and placing ourselves in God's hands the word the the Lord reads thus come now and let us reason together sayeth the Lord though your sins be as Scarlet they shall be white as snow though they be red like Crimson they shall be as wool let us pray brother father we give you thanks for your word thank you for your presence thank you for your people all together we place ourselves in your hands may you give us the nourishment that we need today bless each person here ano the lips that speak Thy word I ask you to please help my interpreter as well the ears that will be hearing this Lord bless each one of us we thank you Father in the Glorious name of our Lord Jesus Christ amen amen thank you you may be seated uh this evening I would like to speak this that I like this message that when when the uh Prophet preached it he called it a conference with God and we will call this St the same way the scripture that we read I find something here I like to highlight that here the ones that's making that call is the Lord he's telling his people he he's not telling this to someone he doesn't know he's telling his people his people specially he's calling to have a dialogue a small talk says come now and let reason together I want us to be you know to be up to dat we want to fix ourselves we want things to go forward the right way now he comes and tells us this and I want to tell you what is a conference a conference is a dialogue Small Talk where uh things are discussed things that required that are of utmost importance it's so important that they need to be talked about to find a solution to those dilemas now this is this is done when there is a crisis or a problem arises usually the nations of the world call the conference immediately to talk about certain problem because that problem is obviously caught that attention and it has to be dealt with and that's the reason why a conference is called now where do these conferences take place usually it's in a quiet place they choose a certain place where there's nothing that can be distracting or interrupt that conference usually you find a peaceful place where they can relax for them that that they don't have any problems around them and they can have an open dialogue about this problem am amen those places that's that's where the these conferences take place now the people that call these conferences usually are the great leaders people that have a a reputable uh ranking they have this charge and they looking for a solution to solve this problem these are the people that usually look for solutions to a problem and usually people hope for these people that they may solve the crisis that arises at a certain place now I want us to kind of go back a little bit and just kind of bear with me for a moment so that I can transmit to you what the Lord has placed in my heart now here's the Lord speaking calling to a conference but now he's doing it individually because he has seen he knows that a problem has arisen there's a crisis in the the L life of the people there is pressure among the people there are situations that a great adversity and the Lord knows that so he calls to his people and you know what there is a crisis there is a problem let us talk about this now when he talks about this if you read the scripture he's making that invitation to a conference to have a dialogue a talk and when he says let us reason together let us reason together look if your sins and my sins my sins are included there as well if there were a Scarlet but if you speak with me they will be white as snow if they were crimson if they were Crimson as crimon they'll be white as wool so when we hear that invitation that the Lord Our God he's calling us to a conference individually we have to have talk talk with him when you come before the Lord you never going to astonish him you're never going to tell him something that he does not know he already knows everything he knows exactly what your problem may be or which ones are you many problems what is it that troubles you what perturbs you what bothers you he knows that already when come before me to have that dialogue and the conference you will never surprise God he already knows this what he wants from us is for us to be honest let us be sincere and tell him Lord I have this problem I know I should be this way but I'm like this and I don't want to be like this anymore I want you to help me there's a crisis the Lord knows this already the problem that we are facing he already knows it he will never be surprised amen he already knows this so why are we having the conference because he wants for us as an individual as a child of God to have that trust that we will find a solution to the problem putting the burdens those problems in his hands amen and for him to take control of each one of our adversities and each one of our problems he will take care of it we must do what we what we need to do like in a service like this did you know that if our spiritual eyes were to be [Applause] open this place is full of angels from God because the Holy Ghost is here but there's many people who do not believe this because they can't feel it but he is here he is faithful to his word even if it was just one person even if the church is empty with only one person surrender to God God comes down he is faithful he does not change he's here to help his people and he's calling us to that conference and that is the reason why in the midst of a tremendous service you're going to find two people sitting in the same place in the same church in the same service listening the same sermon the same preaching and one person can be completely blessed and the other one would not understand absolutely nothing do you know why the difference it's for believers why are you coming what are you searching for today and that's what you shall find my brother I was there in that service I didn't feel anything and the other person he was filled with the Holy Ghost I want you to understand that the Holy Ghost is for all of those who desire it if you want it it is for you if you need a new birth that is for you but we have to and we have to search out what is what that person did so that when they found themselves in this place they were able to receive that blessing and that is why God calls to that conference let me tell you one thing the Lord he is faithful to forgive us you know what there's one thing I want you to understand there is absolutely nothing that we can do for God to love us even more I would say it once again there's nothing that you and I can do we can make God love us even more let me tell you one thing the love of God is perfect he loves you in a way that you cannot understand it and he loves all of us the same way his love is perfect he can't love us anymore because his love is perfect there is nothing that we can do for him to love us even more but one thing we can do how much more can we love God that makes the difference when you love God even more you will be able to enjoy the love of God even more because the love of God is perfect his love does not change and he's given to his children and he wants to tell his children I love you oh but I have done this I've gone through this let me tell you once again God he knows this and he knows what you want and he wants for you to tell him for it to come out of your mouth or because through the mouth comes confession for your salvation we have to speak it because when you speak it when I speak it I say Lord I need you look as a minister yes we need the Lord who told you the minister don't have any problems who told you that the minister do not go through defeat maybe they're the ones that suffer the most but blessed be the name of the Lord that he will forget every he will love us in such a way that he said in his word that he will never leave us alone you go with your family with your parents go with your friends no matter who you are with you know that you are alone no one can understand you but the Lord said in his word that he will not leave us fatherless he will not leave us alone because he he went through through through loneliness he went to the Cross as a man as a failure as a nobody he came to the cross dressing humbleness willing to let himself you know do whatever they want with them he did for that love for us and when he was nailed to that cross he was by himself there was a lot of people there was people around him but he was by himself maybe you feel like that today you see people around you but you feel alone and when when Jesus was SP like that he said these beautiful words my God my God why hast Thou forsaken me I have done so many things and you have forsaken me lying lying as a lamb lying as a lamb because he was the perfect lamb the most precious being among the Earth the the Masterpiece of God the greatest thing from God he became flesh he present himself before us and he died for each one of us for him to understand us for to be like us and when you tell him Lord I feel so alone he he's going to come with you remember my word he will tell you you will never be alone because I made you the promise that I will be with you and even in you until the end of the world blessed be the name of the Lord do you know why doesn't matter what you going through what you going through what no matter what the problem is speak it and when you speak it say Lord this is my problem he already knows it and when you speak it just say Lord I believe that you have control do you know why cuz that's what the Lord wants we want to tell him why we don't have the success in the service we came in and we live the same way because we have not prepared ourselves the Lord says I want to have a conference with you I want to have a dialogue when was the last time that you yourself in the room and pray with me when was the last time that you felt pain and you asked forgiveness when was the last time that you felt sick and you asked me on the contrary you complained you begin to Grumble when was the last time that you pour out your heart and you thank me for everything that you have when was the last time that you appreciated one more day in your life when was the last time that you placed yourself in my hands when you were on your way to work and you said Lord be your will be done and what was the last time that you went through a problem and no matter what the situation was you looked up to heaven and say thank you when was the last time that you were sick and you felt that pain and you were able to overcome and you say Thank You Lord it doesn't matter what you're going through this is not about feelings it's based in faith by the grace of God this is for believers if you believe it doesn't matter what you're going through why are you going through you can be you can't understand my situation you say but the Lord knows it take it to the Lord he's calling for a conference when was the last time that you shut yourself and you left everyone around and you spoke to me to my ear when was the last time that you open your Bible and you read my word or was the last time that you paid attention to one of the many tapes that you have in in your room the last time that you've set a apart a time for me to read a few paragraphs of a message and then we ask ourselves why do we have these many problems the solution he he has already given it to us but even though he already knows it and he's extending the invitation I want to have a conference with you I want to have a dialogue let us talk open your heart the Lord tells you and he tells me come before me Let Us Reason though your sins be as Scarlet they shall be as white as snow they may be red like Crimson they shall be as wool my Breen I tell you one thing I'm the person that comes here that needs from the Lord and at this moment I invite you who needs from the Lord today I will ask there where you are don't look around you where there where you are if you need something from God speak to him right now don't let a moment go by he's calling for a conference knocking on our door to open our heart if you need something from God may the Lord hear you because he already knows it I will ask you there where you are stand up close your eyes and let us pray if you believe it raise your hand my hands are raised because I need from God as well there where you are close your eyes and tell him Lord thank you for your word thank you for your holy spirit thank you for my problems thank you for my battles forgive my defeats but help me to go on forward help me that today I can take a closer walk with you forgive my mistakes and my faults my sins my unbelief but you help me Lord give me that feeling before the the inspiration of your Holy Ghost because I believe your word I'm a Believer today I stand in faith believing that you will answer my prayer you will hear my petition and you will satisfy the need in my heart if that is your petition tell the Lord at this moment Lord I confess I accept it I believe it and all the honor and the glory be for you Lord for you my lord there's nothing Lord but you want us to believe help us to be with you along
