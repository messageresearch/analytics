[35:07] amen
[35:07] [Music]
[35:09] so just as a beginner I want to start
[35:12] over though
[35:13] prayer from the prophet in Massachusetts
[35:15] Church of the Living God
[35:17] and he says and father your humble
[35:19] servant tonight I pray not that these
[35:21] people hear me but I am speaking to thee
[35:23] oh God
[35:24] May the angel that has guided me sent
[35:27] from you and fed me the days of my life
[35:29] may he stand by me tonight to confirm
[35:32] the words that I have said that the
[35:34] people might believe on thee and be
[35:36] saved and healed and may after the going
[35:39] of this meeting when the people wake up
[35:41] to the consciousness of what just
[35:43] happened May there be a Revival in every
[35:45] Church in the city may this city all be
[35:48] all together on us too for the Lord
[35:50] Jesus May every clergy man of the city
[35:52] Be Inspired Lord when he sees his church
[35:54] filling up and the people coming making
[35:56] their confession and wanted to join
[35:58] church and to live for Christ when he
[36:01] sees the sick that was one sick then
[36:03] healed and giving testimony on thousands
[36:06] of others Lord believing granted Lord
[36:08] tonight that something may happen that
[36:10] will stir them
[36:12] amen
[36:13] you feel that way tonight
[36:15] amen that something will steal us
[36:18] tonight that will have such an
[36:20] outpouring of his presence and his
[36:22] spirits and that his holy spirit will
[36:24] dwell Among Us and his presence will be
[36:27] with us and open his worthy man
[36:31] thank you Lamb of God you may have your
[36:33] seats
[36:35] what a time we've been having over the
[36:37] last few weeks what a convention
[36:39] I mean someone said this has been the
[36:41] greatest convention that we've had for a
[36:44] long long long time having a live
[36:46] convention like this what a blessing it
[36:48] has been to have the Brethren and the
[36:51] ministers from all around the world come
[36:53] and preach message after message amen
[36:57] and you appreciate brother Anthony on
[36:59] Sunday
[37:00] um amen
[37:03] thank you Jesus
[37:07] forgive me I I always say I've never I'm
[37:09] never a customer never ready but God is
[37:12] always in control he's always ready he's
[37:15] always prepared he's always on time amen
[37:18] bless the name of the Lord and you know
[37:20] oftentimes we we may go to a convention
[37:23] or in this case where we hosted the
[37:25] convention and we we come back to
[37:26] service and it might be okay to be to be
[37:29] a little overwhelmed and tired but we
[37:31] must never forget what the prize is and
[37:34] keep your eye on the prize
[37:36] despite what come what go who say what
[37:39] no matter what was done what was said we
[37:42] have to ensure that we continue pressing
[37:45] the battle to fight the good fight of
[37:47] Faith onto the resurrection amen so
[37:50] there's no time to sit down and just
[37:52] relax and and live normal and that's one
[37:55] of what I want to share about a little
[37:56] bit
[37:57] you know
[38:00] it's so customary it's so ordinary it's
[38:03] so normal it's almost habitual it's
[38:05] almost cultural that at times we we feel
[38:08] you know a little lethargic and we feel
[38:10] laid back and we feel like we could just
[38:12] take it easy and Float a little bit
[38:15] but
[38:16] before I even move into the scripture I
[38:18] want to give you my title and
[38:19] inspiration the title for tonight is
[38:22] Nester in time again Nest stirring time
[38:27] again and as an inspiration let's have a
[38:29] Revival
[38:30] amen
[38:34] so just as a background as referring to
[38:37] living normal and you know it's it's so
[38:41] customary to come to church and go back
[38:43] home and enter to to pray and and to to
[38:46] fast from time to time and after a while
[38:48] it becomes the norm after a while it
[38:51] becomes comfortable and I want to share
[38:53] something that that I discovered and and
[38:56] I know many of us might be aware of it
[38:58] but I just want to share it
[39:00] um for the benefit of those who may not
[39:01] be so familiar there's something called
[39:03] Stockholm Syndrome
[39:07] by definition it's a psychological
[39:10] response to being held captive
[39:13] psychological so it's in the mind that
[39:15] Battleground dangerous place to be but
[39:19] it's a psychological response to being
[39:22] held captive
[39:23] people with Stockholm syndrome form a
[39:26] psychological connection with their
[39:28] captors and begins sympathizing with
[39:31] them
[39:33] right so so these are the victims or
[39:35] they would be victims feeling almost
[39:37] sorry and feeling a part of the struggle
[39:39] and the journey although they are being
[39:42] held captive in addition to the original
[39:45] kidnapper hostage situation Stockholm
[39:48] syndrome now includes other types of
[39:50] trauma in which there's a bond between
[39:52] the abuser and the person being abused
[39:55] many medical professionals consider the
[39:58] victim's positive feelings towards the
[40:00] abuser a psychological response A coping
[40:03] mechanism that he used to survive the
[40:05] days weeks or even years of trauma or
[40:08] abuse
[40:09] I know some some may wonder what is
[40:12] significance of this what's the purpose
[40:14] of all this how does this relate to
[40:16] having a Revival and and and necessary
[40:19] in time again you see oftentimes we are
[40:22] held captive we are held in bondage and
[40:26] sometimes it becomes so normal that we
[40:28] fail to realize we are really being held
[40:31] captive and tonight we're here to
[40:33] outline to to to outline it and identify
[40:37] the devices of the enemy so we can break
[40:39] free and break past that kind of bondage
[40:42] so we can have a Revival because you
[40:44] can't be bound and have a Revival
[40:46] you can't be struggling and and and
[40:48] you're afraid and you're timid and you
[40:50] don't want to raise your hand and you
[40:52] don't want to worship and you don't want
[40:53] to praise God and have a Revival right
[40:56] so you need to understand the devices of
[40:58] the enemy how he tries to do things
[41:02] for you to feel sorry for your scenario
[41:05] so sorry if it doesn't sound familiar I
[41:08] will use some biblical examples
[41:10] when the children of Israel were in
[41:12] bondage there came a point in which they
[41:14] say listen
[41:15] why don't we go back
[41:18] because it was so normal it was so
[41:21] familiar it was so so they were
[41:23] conditioned culturally so much so that
[41:25] they felt you know what
[41:28] is a real challenge to live in with a
[41:30] real challenge to break free is a real
[41:32] challenge to break loose when you think
[41:34] about it
[41:35] in the early days when they were now in
[41:38] bondage I'm sure there might have been
[41:39] some Escape attempts I'm sure the
[41:43] passion was there the fire was there the
[41:45] bill was there to know listen somebody
[41:47] we were free all along but look what's
[41:49] going on the same thing would have
[41:50] happened in slavery days in more modern
[41:52] times where where the first group of
[41:55] Slayers may have felt what is this this
[41:57] is this is unjust this kind of unjustice
[41:59] kind of thing I want to ensure that I
[42:02] could Escape I want to ensure that I
[42:03] could get away until
[42:07] think about it after 40 years
[42:10] after 100 years keep in mind was 400
[42:12] years right so after 200 years it became
[42:15] normal and ordinary that I grew up born
[42:19] I walk around I've been told I've been
[42:21] sold everybody has told me this is my
[42:24] destiny that it has become so accustomed
[42:27] it became accustomed to them they now
[42:30] develop habits or coping mechanisms that
[42:33] they they they almost resigned
[42:35] themselves to slavery that I'm going to
[42:37] work for the Taskmaster all my life and
[42:40] there's no coming out but tonight I'm
[42:42] here to say it's Nestor in time again
[42:45] Something's Gonna Shake something has to
[42:48] break something has to change for you to
[42:50] realize that this is not normal it is
[42:53] not normal to go to church and come back
[42:55] home it is not normal to sit down and
[42:58] and hope that something is going to
[43:00] happen it's not normal to sit down and
[43:02] pray that sometimes we'll have a Revival
[43:05] yes no no no no no no no
[43:07] something has to strike something has to
[43:10] change to ensure that on the inside
[43:12] inside that little button inside that
[43:15] little feet inside could be stirred up
[43:16] enough that you could have a Revival as
[43:19] an individual
[43:20] amen
[43:23] when you consider Noah Noah Noah's day
[43:28] and I'll read it in a second might have
[43:30] been the epitome of normal living
[43:32] right the Bible actually said you know
[43:34] they multiplied it they you know they
[43:36] took unto themselves wives and they they
[43:38] just expanded I just live and then they
[43:41] were evil and they were doing so many
[43:43] things that God repented that he created
[43:45] man
[43:46] that was the days of Noah you see it had
[43:49] become so normal every day day in day
[43:52] out you know what I got a wife here a
[43:54] family expander open my business and do
[43:57] things it became so normal that they
[43:59] forgot the boss himself
[44:02] they forgot their purpose they forgot
[44:04] that they were called until purpose
[44:06] right even when we look at a lot
[44:09] God revealed himself to Abraham and told
[44:12] him what was going to take place the the
[44:14] the the Abomination I was in Sodom and
[44:16] Gomorrah and lots being accustomed to
[44:20] this type of Lifestyle being accustomed
[44:22] to his way of living thought it normal
[44:25] to live in Sodom and Gomorrah
[44:28] it it became so familiar to him that he
[44:31] didn't even see listen what what is
[44:34] really going on just like slavery we're
[44:36] done wait a minute wait a minute similar
[44:39] to to to the prodigal's son you know
[44:42] normal living here just doing you're
[44:44] just going day after day month after me
[44:46] month year after year until something
[44:49] strikes sometimes it takes something
[44:51] drastic or dramatic to really impact
[44:54] your life and cause you to to take
[44:56] account cause you to check yourself and
[44:58] say listen wait wait wait wait wait wait
[45:00] a minute hold on
[45:01] like that guy who said listen I know way
[45:04] back in Africa I'm the child of a king
[45:05] so he had to sit on and say wait a
[45:07] minute even these servants in My
[45:09] Father's House
[45:11] have food they get paid they have place
[45:13] to live they're not living among the
[45:14] pigs they're not eating pig food so just
[45:17] like that sometimes it takes something
[45:19] with that I want to just ask you to
[45:21] stand as we read the scripture
[45:24] as you tune with me to the Book of Luke
[45:27] reading from chapter 17.
[45:33] this
[45:35] verses 26 to 29
[45:41] when you find it say Amen Luke chapter
[45:43] 17 26-29
[45:47] and as it was in the day of Noah so
[45:50] shall it be also in the days of the son
[45:53] of man did it eat they drank they
[45:55] married wives they were given in
[45:56] marriage until the day that Noah entered
[45:58] into the ark and the flood came and
[46:00] destroyed them all likewise also as it
[46:04] was in the days of lot did it eat they
[46:06] drunk they bought their soul they
[46:08] planted they build it
[46:10] but the same day that lot went out of
[46:12] Sodom it rained fire and brimstone from
[46:14] heaven and destroyed them all Legends
[46:17] Bar heads oh Heavenly Father tonight we
[46:20] deem it such a privilege to be gathered
[46:22] together Lord Lord I pray that you would

[47:36] getting nebulize may God heal him
[47:38] totally in Jesus name O Heavenly Father
[47:40] we pause once more to bring Alexander
[47:42] Henry before you Lord Lord you know
[47:44] you've got he's gone through so much
[47:45] Lord and even as he is in hospital right
[47:48] now I pray that you meet him wherever he
[47:50] is Lord we're down to bed on a chair

[48:06] will raise them up Lord in Jesus name we
[48:09] pray amen
[48:14] amen amen amen you love him
[48:18] you know I just want to start from uh
[48:21] is a message Israel and the church
[48:23] number one in 1953
[48:26] uh paragraph 159 it says and we started
[48:29] off with Ephesus and ended up in
[48:31] laodicea the lukewarm Church age where
[48:34] we are now having a form of godliness
[48:36] but denying the power thereof going to
[48:39] church and having people come in and
[48:40] saying accept Christ and puts in the
[48:42] name of the on a book but denying the
[48:44] baptism of the Holy ghosts and power and
[48:47] miracles and signs and wonders making
[48:49] fun of it in laodicean
[48:52] Church age which is spewed from God's
[48:55] mouth and the electric nap oh hallelujah
[48:57] oh something gets in my soul when I
[48:59] think about it friends or the world is
[49:01] in a condition today so we've already
[49:03] identified that this is not us no no we
[49:07] identify this because sometimes it's
[49:09] important to to identify what you don't
[49:12] want to be where you don't want to be
[49:13] where you shouldn't be so when I talk
[49:15] about slavery and when I talk about
[49:17] people in bondage and when we talk about
[49:19] Stockholm syndrome we don't want to be
[49:21] there we don't want to accept or become
[49:23] normal we don't want the norm be you
[49:26] know the devil you know the devil
[49:29] fighting me today you know struggling
[49:31] because this is what I am resigned to
[49:33] this this is this is his job and you
[49:36] start to pick up for him that's not what
[49:38] we want to do we identify that because
[49:40] we want to come against that
[49:42] we want to resist that we want to fight
[49:46] against that so you see this definition
[49:48] here this is an age we don't want that
[49:53] we want to accept the power of the Holy
[49:55] Ghost to come and heal and deliver and
[49:58] seal and baptize and set free and break
[50:00] bonds and loose
[50:03] that's what we want to anoint that's
[50:05] what we want to see in the church
[50:06] [Applause]
[50:08] all right
[50:11] no
[50:15] in a message super sign 63
[50:18] paragraph 25 forgive me for quoting so
[50:21] much tonight and it says I know we find
[50:24] just about the same thing existing today
[50:25] when we know that we're living in the
[50:27] hour that gross darknesses cover Youth
[50:30] and the people and we find that all
[50:32] these modern achievements of super age
[50:34] and so forth that we're living in is
[50:36] only a sign of gross darkness in the
[50:38] spiritual realm we're in
[50:41] laodicea's church age
[50:43] where they're just lukewarm they could
[50:45] go to church and people does and seems
[50:48] to have a Zeal to go to church but to
[50:50] know anything about your spirits the
[50:52] time that they're living in some of them
[50:53] they are blind as they prove by his
[50:56] words still they just can't see it I
[50:58] wonder if it isn't just about like what
[51:00] he said we have eyes where we can't see
[51:02] we ought to look around and see all
[51:04] these things that happens our sign that
[51:06] the end is at hand because these are the
[51:09] things that was predicted to be at that
[51:11] time I want you to notice the unchanging
[51:14] continuity of God's word and his work
[51:16] see he never changes his program he
[51:20] never changes his ways just as perfectly
[51:22] the scripture is in perfect continuity
[51:25] everything that God does is in
[51:27] continuity with what he what what he
[51:30] done
[51:31] see what he did first that's he'll do it
[51:35] the second time the same way
[51:37] and just to prove it to you he has made
[51:39] laws in the earth and he's always given
[51:41] his people a sign before the event
[51:43] happens now he has always done it and he
[51:46] will always do it because he's at the
[51:48] unchangeable god I am God he says I
[51:51] change not the way he sets this program
[51:53] at the beginning that's the way he is at
[51:56] each age he never changes it when he
[51:58] puts the world to turn on 24-hour basis
[52:01] we might have Daylight Saving Times and
[52:03] all kinds of times but it never changes
[52:05] tuning of the world we make a complete
[52:08] circle every 24 hours turns around never
[52:12] changes his season God has spring summer
[52:14] winter just exactly like it always was
[52:16] that's the way he done it first that's
[52:19] the way he does it every time the
[52:21] continuity of his laws and of his word
[52:23] and of his works and all just perfectly
[52:25] Blends together therefore if we look
[52:28] what was
[52:30] he can know what is and what will be you
[52:33] can base your thoughts upon that for the
[52:35] scripture says he's the same yesterday
[52:37] today and forever so I ask you if he's
[52:40] the same yesterday today and forever and
[52:43] he took the children of Israel out of
[52:45] bondage and he took a lot out of Sodom
[52:47] and he took Noah and put him in an ark
[52:50] and shut the door and put a hedge of
[52:53] safety a wrong job what more will he do
[52:56] for us
[52:57] he's obligated to do the same thing
[52:59] every age he doesn't change he sees the
[53:03] continuity and is obligated to do that
[53:05] every time he did it yesterday he'll do
[53:09] it today and he'll do it again tomorrow
[53:11] because that's just the God we serve the
[53:14] same yesterday today and forever amen
[53:16] not never changes
[53:20] [Applause]
[53:22] [Music]
[53:27] you know when I said Nester in time
[53:29] brother Branham preached many many
[53:31] messages on Eagles and and still around
[53:34] and the nests and stuff many many
[53:36] messages various titles and it reminded
[53:40] me when when I looked at the eagle and
[53:42] look at some of these stories he gave
[53:43] some of the illustrations and and
[53:45] analogies he always referenced the fact
[53:48] that the eaglets would be in the nest
[53:50] they would be there and the mother Eagle
[53:52] would come and feed them
[53:54] they would feed them I assume would
[53:57] teach them guide them direct them until
[54:00] they reach a certain level of maturity
[54:03] right similar to our Pilots now somebody
[54:06] with ambitions to be a pilot doesn't
[54:08] wake up a day and say I want to be a
[54:10] pilot I'm going to fly a plane it has
[54:12] happened that way they need to go to
[54:14] training have tutors Governors ensure
[54:17] the Richer position in which the trainer
[54:20] has the the confidence and faith and
[54:24] knows that they are able and even then
[54:27] they don't send them out alone right
[54:29] so just like the mother Eagle they have
[54:33] them in the nurse they feed them they
[54:34] train them they guide them they prep
[54:36] them but you know what
[54:38] the in an environment that's comfortable
[54:40] that has become the norm that has become
[54:44] accustomed to them so they have habits
[54:47] in which
[54:48] is soft they know mother Eagle will
[54:51] bring food from a particular time in a
[54:53] particular way they will always be be
[54:56] fed and dealt with in a particular way
[54:58] until the mother Eagle as the teens or
[55:02] decides or figures out that they mature
[55:04] enough
[55:05] it was it is it is almost illegal for
[55:09] for the mother Eagle to take the the
[55:11] eaglet too young and throw it out in US
[55:15] similar to Children you can't take a
[55:17] child your child is a baby and you say
[55:19] walk down the road no it doesn't happen
[55:21] like you protect them and you form a
[55:23] hedge around them and they guide them
[55:24] until they're mature enough to be able
[55:27] to make decisions and be responsible and
[55:29] they could follow instructions amen so
[55:33] just like the pilot the pilot after
[55:36] training whether months or years or
[55:38] whatever period it takes they have
[55:40] something called inaugural flight or
[55:42] your first flight it's the first time
[55:44] you're going to go into the air right
[55:46] when they certainly cockpit there and
[55:48] they are about to take off they have to
[55:51] remember they have to go through they
[55:53] have to recall all the lessons only the
[55:55] solid training all the advice only
[55:57] recommendations right because they want
[56:00] to have a successful flight
[56:02] same way when the mother Eagle comes
[56:04] where isn't going to take place
[56:06] something does change the mother Eagle
[56:09] will look at them and start to make some
[56:12] noises that they never heard before but
[56:14] they know that's mother Eagle when that
[56:17] point comes
[56:18] the mother Eagle knows the mature enough
[56:21] to take the next step to take the
[56:24] inaugural flight the first flight they
[56:26] never fly before no First Flight is one
[56:29] of the most important and spectacular
[56:31] experiences because you've never done it
[56:33] before you know the kind of trust
[56:35] confidence and fate you need to take
[56:37] that first flight
[56:38] mother ego comes
[56:40] and before the flight mother Eagle
[56:43] shakes happiness
[56:48] to move
[56:49] all you lose things because you
[56:52] take them on the Fly
[56:53] holding on to the
[56:55] internet and holding on to Egypt and
[56:57] holding on to what was there before no
[57:00] you're gonna take them to another level
[57:02] you're gonna raise up above your
[57:04] circumstance above your custom above
[57:08] your habits above what you see as normal
[57:11] because what you think is normal is not
[57:13] normal anymore normal living cannot take
[57:16] into the Rapture you cannot go day in
[57:19] day out you come to church and you go
[57:21] back home and you go to church and you
[57:23] go back home and no change there has to
[57:25] come a point in which you get stirred up
[57:27] things change so sometimes you're forced
[57:31] to make that change and I'm gonna read
[57:33] it for you
[57:34] I'm gonna read it for you
[57:38] an eagle the eagle in her nest 57.
[57:43] right and just in the middle of
[57:44] paragraph 16 he said and God does the
[57:46] same thing in his church when we have
[57:49] all when we have got all settled down on
[57:51] something what shall we settled when
[57:54] you're subtle and you're comfortable and
[57:56] you feel like you know what I've got
[57:57] this I just go back and forth and God
[58:00] will bless me and things will happen and
[58:02] my family and you know everything will
[58:05] work out and everything is smooth no he
[58:07] said then God steals in us again
[58:10] he don't want it remain normal he says
[58:12] he brought Martin Luther from
[58:14] Catholicism and then they got so starchy
[58:17] that he stood the nest and sent Wesleyan
[58:20] then Wesley got so starchy he stood in
[58:24] essence and Pentecost sin it's Nester in
[58:27] time again because we got so settled
[58:31] down we got so comfortable we got so
[58:34] laid back we got to a level of
[58:36] acceptance where we thought like
[58:37] Stockholm syndrome that this is where we
[58:39] supposed to be and this is what we
[58:42] accustomed to and and you know we got a
[58:45] little chance now and again and we like
[58:47] it and that's fine but no no no no no
[58:49] God has way better in store for you so
[58:53] it goes on and he said this old mother
[58:56] eagle flies into the nest one day all
[58:58] unexpected
[59:00] unexpectedly little eaglets and as she
[59:02] comes into as she comes and oh how I've
[59:05] laid and watched them and weep like a
[59:07] baby with my binoculars trained on them
[59:10] my horse tied off somewhere watching
[59:12] them and she'll fly into the nest and
[59:14] she'll take those great wings and she'll
[59:16] give them a great shower of wind
[59:19] chicken things up a little bit you're
[59:21] not coming in quiet and smooth you're
[59:23] coming in with a shower of wind that's
[59:26] not what they're accustomed to it shakes
[59:28] every loose feather out to them so even
[59:31] if the eaglets have loose there's a
[59:33] shake North
[59:35] nothing else going on this trip nothing
[59:38] else taking this flight nothing loose
[59:41] because she's fixing to give them their
[59:44] first little solo flight you can't have
[59:47] loose feathers when you're solo flying
[59:49] for the Lord
[59:50] she flies in and they have a mighty
[59:52] Russian wind they never felt it before
[59:55] because they were born in the cleft of
[59:57] the rock why they are eagles but God
[1:00:00] changes it he gives them something new
[1:00:02] as the church was born in the as at the
[1:00:06] top of the rock we cannot be satisfied
[1:00:07] there God stirs up the nest sometimes
[1:00:10] this is not a pastor saying of the nest
[1:00:13] this is not a preacher's saying of the
[1:00:15] nest but God says happiness because he
[1:00:18] won that shaken to pray take place it's
[1:00:20] not because he vexed with you no he
[1:00:23] wants more for you he wants better for
[1:00:26] you so he has to shake you from wherever
[1:00:28] you are to take her to the next step
[1:00:30] amen
[1:00:36] now listen
[1:00:37] God stirs up the nest sometimes comes in
[1:00:40] with a mighty Russian wind like he did
[1:00:41] on the day of Pentecost and all the old
[1:00:44] worldly loose feathers fly out he sends
[1:00:47] a Pentecostal Revival and shakes up the
[1:00:49] nest then he gives a certain scream oh
[1:00:52] all the little eaglets know something is
[1:00:55] fixing to happen when that scream goes
[1:00:57] out you gotta take notice that something
[1:01:00] is fixing to happen you can't sit sit
[1:01:03] dead you gotta raise your hands you've
[1:01:05] got to open your mouth you've got to
[1:01:07] clap you gotta move your feet You Gotta
[1:01:09] Dance a little bit because something is
[1:01:10] fixed in to happen
[1:01:12] he gives a certain scream oh all the
[1:01:15] little eaglets know something is fixing
[1:01:17] to happen they're Eagles that's the
[1:01:19] reason when you see a shaken time come
[1:01:21] Eagles are ready for a blessing the
[1:01:24] church is ready for something the True
[1:01:26] Church of God when the sea are shaken
[1:01:28] time coming the old mother then throws
[1:01:31] her wings out and those little baby
[1:01:33] eagle at somehow they know by Nature
[1:01:35] Because of Who You Are by Nature they
[1:01:37] know just like a little calf he knows
[1:01:40] when he's born to get up and go nurse
[1:01:42] the mother nothing there to tell him but
[1:01:44] it's God that tells him those little
[1:01:46] Eagles know just how to place their
[1:01:49] little feet in her wings and take their
[1:01:51] little beak and hold on to a big strong
[1:01:53] feather God tells them and the Church of
[1:01:56] the Living God knows how to take whole
[1:01:59] of the word of God those Strong Winds of
[1:02:02] his deliverance and hold on to his
[1:02:04] Divine promise
[1:02:06] when a mighty shaken strikes the place
[1:02:08] they know how to hold something just
[1:02:12] tells them the world might say
[1:02:13] fanaticism but they take a hole of the
[1:02:16] wing and they hold on because the nature
[1:02:18] is eagles they know what to do amen my
[1:02:22] my my my blessed be the name of the Lord
[1:02:26] you see he's looking for people who have
[1:02:29] a passion to know the word to hold on to
[1:02:31] every promise a cry to get in the spirit
[1:02:34] and a fervent desire to please him
[1:02:36] that's what he's looking for you know
[1:02:41] in a message just one more time lord
[1:02:45] paragraph 52 he said did you ever think
[1:02:48] talking about Samson
[1:02:50] while those Philistines were wondering
[1:02:52] about Samson did you ever think what was
[1:02:54] going through Samson's mind
[1:02:56] what do you think was going on through
[1:02:58] that mind's mind
[1:03:00] I believe he was thinking while he was
[1:03:02] there yet totally blind never to have a
[1:03:06] sight again he was thinking about all
[1:03:08] the great victories that God had given
[1:03:11] there he was thinking of the days that
[1:03:14] was what they used to do
[1:03:16] and that's just about the way man is
[1:03:19] as I said here some time ago man is
[1:03:21] always thinking back what God did and
[1:03:24] looking forward to what God will do but
[1:03:27] ignoring what God is doing
[1:03:30] see look what he's doing now
[1:03:33] we know what he has done
[1:03:35] and he's sending to us and trying to
[1:03:37] stir us up again trying to bring us back
[1:03:40] to the path to his word and proving it
[1:03:43] by his Vindicated word
[1:03:45] and we just sit sleep go home say what
[1:03:49] did he say I hate to go hear them carry
[1:03:52] on so long that was coming in his mind
[1:03:55] but what we would call his Haiti back
[1:03:58] when he was in the spirit of the Lord
[1:03:59] still talking about Samson when the Lord
[1:04:01] answered his prayer even before he
[1:04:04] prayed as long as he lived for God God
[1:04:06] was right on time he didn't have to
[1:04:08] think about well no I gotta pray through
[1:04:11] now and see if these thousand
[1:04:13] Philistines you know what's going on
[1:04:15] happen here boy because I really didn't
[1:04:17] anticipate so many of them no no no no
[1:04:19] no he know that God was with him there
[1:04:22] was no condemnation so he just grabbed
[1:04:25] the first thing he had in his hand and
[1:04:28] went to beat him that's right he didn't
[1:04:30] wait until he gets a bachelor's of art
[1:04:32] or learn how to do well with this thing
[1:04:35] no no no he just took what was in his
[1:04:38] hand and started slugging with it so
[1:04:41] this eliminate the excuse about you know
[1:04:45] I I read enough you know I have studied
[1:04:48] enough I have reached that quote in the
[1:04:50] in the message I read in no no no use
[1:04:53] what you have use the words use these
[1:04:56] seeds that planted in your soul and Slug
[1:04:59] and fight because the devil not waiting
[1:05:02] the adversary fight is not waiting to
[1:05:05] say listen I'll wait until you finish
[1:05:08] school
[1:05:09] get a degree and a job because I really
[1:05:11] want you to be positioned in a way that
[1:05:15] we could be on an equal footing before
[1:05:17] we could strike and face the battle he
[1:05:20] not waiting on that you heard the prayer
[1:05:22] requests from Alex the night he wish he
[1:05:24] could snuff him out tonight
[1:05:26] you understand he's not waiting on on if
[1:05:29] you read the scripture last night no no
[1:05:31] no no no
[1:05:32] you need to be empowered you need to be
[1:05:35] inspired you need to take action tonight
[1:05:37] don't wait for tomorrow take action
[1:05:40] tonight when he faced you on the road
[1:05:42] when you meet him going down by the
[1:05:44] traffic light wherever you go you have
[1:05:46] to be able to meet him anywhere any
[1:05:49] place anytime under any condition you
[1:05:51] have to be able to to challenge him
[1:05:53] wherever he is and back him up not just
[1:05:56] challenge him but conquer and overcome
[1:05:58] and get the victory
[1:06:04] come on
[1:06:06] I said it before but we want to shift to
[1:06:08] Revival what is Revival thing about this
[1:06:11] fella come to talk Revival tonight you
[1:06:13] don't know we just come out a convention
[1:06:15] and and we're still going through some
[1:06:17] of the tips and hearing fresh things
[1:06:19] every time what Revival talk is this
[1:06:22] you know but
[1:06:25] there's a message called expectation
[1:06:30] yeah and in that message
[1:06:33] it's about Revival and we know it very
[1:06:35] very familiar
[1:06:36] paragraph five he said no a minister
[1:06:38] cannot bring a Revival there's no
[1:06:40] preacher can bring a Revival he doesn't
[1:06:43] pack it with him the only thing he can
[1:06:45] do is just be loyal to God and his word
[1:06:47] and the Revival listen to this the
[1:06:49] Revival
[1:06:51] has to come by the people in your home
[1:06:54] in your life
[1:06:56] now Revival isn't adding new members to
[1:06:58] the church it's Reviving what we've
[1:07:00] already got to revive means to bring
[1:07:03] back so a Revival and he went on to say
[1:07:07] I stood here some years ago
[1:07:09] for my first time by a large body of
[1:07:11] water which was Lake Michigan
[1:07:13] I was about just had been ordained in
[1:07:16] the Missouri Baptist Church I was about
[1:07:18] 20 or 21 years old
[1:07:21] and I went up there and when they had
[1:07:23] the
[1:07:24] great Easter Sunrise Service out on the
[1:07:27] Lakeside and I was acquainted with Paul
[1:07:29] radar and he was supposed to speak at
[1:07:31] that meeting and I wanted to visit the
[1:07:33] Tabernacle while I was in Chicago
[1:07:35] and it was my first time to see that
[1:07:38] large body of water
[1:07:40] Michigan
[1:07:42] and I went out on Lake Shore Drive and I
[1:07:44] stood out there a little while and I
[1:07:46] noticed all of them weaves jumping up
[1:07:48] and down just splashing around I thought
[1:07:50] what's it so excited about
[1:07:54] what's all the excitement and the little
[1:07:56] waves would start and then run out and
[1:07:58] be big great big great big waves and
[1:08:01] bumps into each other
[1:08:03] and break apart and the form would fly
[1:08:06] up and it it come back in and and then I
[1:08:09] see the big waves coming again breaking
[1:08:12] on the bank like they used to hear but
[1:08:15] that was something new for me because
[1:08:17] he's never experienced that before a
[1:08:20] landlocked seven so I noticed how it
[1:08:21] would and I said well what it must be
[1:08:24] that legs having a Revival that must be
[1:08:26] what it is it's having a big time just
[1:08:29] jumping up and down I thought that's
[1:08:31] good that's fine but you know I thought
[1:08:33] well wonder if it got a lot extra water
[1:08:36] when it's having a Revival it is it
[1:08:39] revived because you're pouring a lot of
[1:08:40] water perhaps it have rain
[1:08:42] he said
[1:08:44] I thought that but he said no there
[1:08:47] isn't one drop more in it right now than
[1:08:50] if it will perfectly come
[1:08:52] not one bit it's the same water but just
[1:08:55] having a Revival jumping up and down I
[1:08:58] thought well what good does that do come
[1:09:01] to find out when it's having Revival and
[1:09:04] jumping up and down like that it washes
[1:09:06] all the trash out of it up on the shore
[1:09:10] let me read that one more time come to
[1:09:12] find out when it's having Revival and
[1:09:15] jumping up and down like that it washes
[1:09:18] all the trash out of it up on the shore
[1:09:21] so that's what the church needs it's a
[1:09:24] Revival getting all the world and the
[1:09:26] things of the world washed out so it can
[1:09:29] look clear be pretty again when it all
[1:09:32] comes down it's got the same amounts of
[1:09:34] water but what causes the sea to do that
[1:09:37] is because there is a wind comes that
[1:09:40] wind again when the eagle came there was
[1:09:43] a wind
[1:09:43] with the water here they say there's a
[1:09:46] wind that comes begins to blow against
[1:09:48] the waves blow against the body of water
[1:09:50] and pick it up well that's what the
[1:09:53] church needs tonight it's a mighty
[1:09:55] Russian wind coming down upon it again
[1:09:58] and Reviving it and getting all the
[1:10:01] world out and the things of the world
[1:10:03] out and that way then it starts a
[1:10:06] Revival and then when it settles down
[1:10:09] the church is all in condition then to
[1:10:14] start off to receive spiritual gifts and
[1:10:16] blessings from God and that's what we
[1:10:19] want amen
[1:10:21] oh my my my
[1:10:24] it's necessary in time again
[1:10:28] [Music]
[1:10:30] Nest here in time again
[1:10:34] in a message
[1:10:36] as the Eagles Stir It Up her nest
[1:10:39] in that message
[1:10:41] paragraph 76.

[1:10:46] speaking about a lost eaglet

[1:11:52] Lamb's Book of Life before the
[1:11:54] foundation of the world my sheep know my
[1:11:56] voice when they heard that it's just

[1:13:22] what we need today is a power of the
[1:13:24] Holy Ghost what we need today is Eagle

[1:14:05] happy amen
[1:14:07] my I I I don't know where he go much
[1:14:11] longer or not this seemed like if I take
[1:14:14] off right now this feels good to me to
[1:14:17] know that it's the truth it's not a
[1:14:19] Santa Claus story this is not a Mickey
[1:14:21] Mouse thing this is the truth of the
[1:14:24] Living God do you believe it yeah with
[1:14:27] all your heart do you believe we need a
[1:14:29] necessary in time do you need need a
[1:14:32] holy ghost again do you believe we need
[1:14:34] a fresh pouring out of his Spirit do you
[1:14:37] believe the church need re-baptize and
[1:14:40] again do you believe it with all your
[1:14:41] heart let's start something right now
[1:14:44] will you are you ready to get under the
[1:14:46] wind are you ready to do it do you
[1:14:49] believe
[1:14:51] amen amen
[1:14:54] thank you Jesus Blessed Be His Marvelous
[1:14:58] name
[1:15:00] I want to shift slightly as we begin to
[1:15:03] wind down
[1:15:04] and and and head to the Seal of God
[1:15:06] because why we want our Revival anyway
[1:15:08] why you want to boil the trash out why
[1:15:11] we want to go to a higher level why we
[1:15:13] want God to sit up the nest why
[1:15:15] because there are other things for us to
[1:15:17] do we call to a higher level in the Seal
[1:15:21] of God paragraph 166 he says no what
[1:15:25] does ceiling mean
[1:15:26] ceiling is a sign of completion is that
[1:15:29] right
[1:15:30] well did you ever see a real ruler
[1:15:33] loading the cars and I did some research
[1:15:35] on this you know it's something else
[1:15:38] because they sometimes travel long long
[1:15:39] distances
[1:15:41] sometimes they go through all sorts of
[1:15:43] of adversities so it actually says
[1:15:46] before you fill this car you have to
[1:15:49] ensure that the sides are sung you have
[1:15:51] to ensure the flaw is sound the roof
[1:15:54] must be sound everything must be able to
[1:15:56] seal inside out
[1:15:58] it must be solid because as it travels
[1:16:02] at a pace you want to ensure nothing
[1:16:05] could become loose nothing could move
[1:16:08] so he goes on to say he'll go out
[1:16:12] and he'll set so much here and so much
[1:16:15] here the inspector comes by he looks in
[1:16:18] and if this is a little loose he shakes
[1:16:20] it shakes it shakes because it can't be
[1:16:23] loose so you shake a little bit and make
[1:16:25] sure your knuckles it must be solid
[1:16:27] right so that's what he's shaking does
[1:16:30] at times it tests the Integrity of The
[1:16:33] Boxcar you want to ensure you're solid
[1:16:35] the inspector comes by
[1:16:38] he looks in and if it's a little loose
[1:16:40] it shakes nope I won't seal it got to
[1:16:44] tear it out and do it over again next
[1:16:46] thing you'll try to load it again he'll
[1:16:48] get this wrong the inspector come by
[1:16:50] wrong do it over again do it over as
[1:16:54] long as it takes to get it right because
[1:16:57] only Solid box cars move moving forward
[1:17:00] no loose no shaking nothing out of place
[1:17:04] everything must be in position I'll be
[1:17:07] gone do it again and that's what God has
[1:17:09] been doing with his church for a long
[1:17:11] time you load up and you go into heaven
[1:17:13] you're taking everything with you your
[1:17:15] card games huh every other thing that
[1:17:18] you can load into the church you're
[1:17:19] trying to take it with you God just
[1:17:21] condemns it ain't ready for ceiling but
[1:17:24] when God sees a man contrite broken
[1:17:27] Spirit sincere and heart down at the
[1:17:30] altar God closes the door of the world
[1:17:32] to him and seals him in there by the
[1:17:34] baptism of the Holy Ghost and it lasts
[1:17:37] until Jesus comes not from one Revival
[1:17:40] to the other but until the day of your
[1:17:43] Redemption when that boxcar the door is
[1:17:46] closed and the government seal is put on
[1:17:49] it it cannot be opened no more until it
[1:17:53] reaches its final destination
[1:17:57] foreign
[1:18:00] to come forward
[1:18:03] you know
[1:18:06] in a message adoption number two
[1:18:12] this has a close he said the church is
[1:18:14] supposed to be predestinated onto the
[1:18:16] adoption of children
[1:18:18] we are man God can take a man and adopt
[1:18:21] him in his family now this is the
[1:18:23] process we're going through
[1:18:24] so you're accustomed to adversity you're
[1:18:27] custom to to bondage accustomed to the
[1:18:30] slavery of the world you're accustomed
[1:18:31] to what Satan has to offer but God has
[1:18:35] come to shake you up a little bit to
[1:18:37] stir you up a little bit to challenge
[1:18:40] status quo to move you beyond what
[1:18:43] you're accustomed to to bring it to a
[1:18:45] higher level and in this case why he
[1:18:48] said the church is supposed to be
[1:18:50] predestinated unto the adoption of
