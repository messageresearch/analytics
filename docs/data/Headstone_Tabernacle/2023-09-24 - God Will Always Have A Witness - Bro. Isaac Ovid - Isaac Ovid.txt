Jesus Christ amen and amen in the church says hey man you appreciate the worship this morning you appreciate the song service this morning [Music] [Applause] amen hallelujah hallelujah let's just go straight to the scripture and I'll do greetings afterwards just one portion of scripture while you're on your feet let me read from acts 1 and verse 8 just one portion of scripture acts 1 8 familiar scripture but ye shall receive power after that the Holy Ghost has come upon you and ye shall be Witnesses unto me both in Jerusalem and in all Judea and in Samaria and unto the uttermost part of the earth may the Lord a blessing to the reading of his word you may be seated this morning in the presence of the Lord hallelujah hallelujah are you happy to be in the house of the Lord this morning for this special time uh on a Sunday there's no place I'd rather be than in his presence you feel that way this morning a many many men and what a time we have been having and what a set of services over the last few Services my mind is completely blown and we ought to be so grateful for God to keeping us tuned in to the his presence and his power and his will and his grace and how God has been using the ministers to bring us into Readiness and we are so appreciated of that by the grace of God so this morning I want to wish a special happy birthday to our precious brother Anthony O'Brien you appreciate brother Anthony what a gift from the Lord sold out committed and today is also his anniversary so God bless you happy anniversary you eat up with Anthony and sister kosher may God richly bless you and continue to use you and from strength to strength and for those who were in the youth service yesterday we had a really tremendous time so I want to salute The Young and the young at heart who were present for the Youth service and we had a really tremendous time and we are looking by the grace of God to have some wonderful sessions coming up again so we want to encourage those of you who were not there to make every effort to be there and to be able to grow and strengthen one another by the grace of God so we are here one more time and as you know today we have this service after which we'll serve lunch and then this evening we can have a time of Praise on worship and spending time in the presence of the Lord and when you really look at how much time we have in the week we really don't give enough to the Lord we could always give more to the Lord so we want to give a little more today and push a little extra today and to give him what he rightly deserves our lives and not our own we belong to him so the least we could do is give our all back to him you feel that way this morning hey man so just for a few uh also critical announcements next Sunday uh as you know is the first uh of the month so we'll have our communion service in the evening uh the following Sunday which is October 8th I want you to take note uh that yarel Tabernacle will be coming up to have service with us and uh brother yadel you would remember would have greeted a convention uh before brother robledo preached and it was such a tremendous blessing so brother yadel will be ministering to us on October the 8th so beyond the great expectation to be in fellowship with the Tabernacle by the Thornhill and the church and uh bring your fire so we create an atmosphere of fellowship and praise you believe that this morning you're on the expectation for what God is doing wonderful so just before I get into the message I was reading this quote and this quote really blessed me from the message here em and brother Madam said what we need today is a real genuine cleaned up Holy Ghost Field Church packed up with the Holy Ghost and he says Ready filled and unctionized with God's holy spirit so the prophet said this to that word unctionized becomes a word right there can I read it one more time he said what we need today is a real genuine cleaned up Holy Ghost Field Church packed up with the Holy Ghost ready filled and unctionized with God's holy spirit yes sir I believe that he said if we fail to preach it God will raise up the Baptist or Presbyterians or somebody to do it he certainly will because he is going to have a church there without spot or wrinkle and he says yeah he will do it so it's not me to do it it's not you to do it he said he will do it he will bring it to pass if that doesn't make you happy to know that he promised to do it and he is going to fulfill it he is going to raise up he is going to deliver he is going to baptize he's going to call from the east from the west from the north from the south he's going to straighten out he's going to shape oh Hallelujah so whether Bradham goes on he said so brethren let's just shake ourselves and rise out of the Dust oh sometimes we find ourselves in the dust sometimes we find ourselves in the ash heat sometimes we find ourselves feeling all kind of different ways and when the Branham is seeing that in the spiritual realm he says let's shake ourselves oh and rise out of the dust and Shake ourselves he says he says it again and get in the ground All gospel way and March up the highway that's the only thing to do is Onward Christian Soldiers he says he had no time to slack or be easy now let's start going for the kingdom of God oh no time to slap the slack no time to give up a Holy Ghost Church a holy ghost filled Church washed in the blood of the Lamb can the church see amen so I have a title this morning God will always have a witness can the church say amen God will always have a witness you believe that throughout every age I don't matter how tough it gets I don't matter how bad it gets him I don't matter what the devil is doing I don't matter what takes place brother Branham said one day the message itself will look defeated but God will always have a witness oh Hallelujah he's gonna find somebody somewhere in every single age he do he did it this age is going to be no different and for a subject what we have seen happen should put every soul into action oh you know the quote what we have seen happen should put every soul into action and my inspiration is a question what kind of witness are you oh hallelujah hallelujah what kind of witness are you you know I was driving up to church this morning and I was saying to my wife the ten lepers they saw something they met Jesus you know what it is to meet Jesus and have Jesus talk to you and minister to your need but these ten lepers met Jesus didn't meet a preacher didn't meet an evangelist did he admit a message person with a Booker they met Jesus and they were looking to find some kind of relief and Jesus said go show yourself to the priest and while they were obedient to the voice of the master while they were just walking under the instructions of the master healing met them on the road and they were all healed up they were all Witnesses of the healing but you know something only one of them came back to give worship and it made me realize many people will see many things many will experience many things but only few will come back to worship only few will give God praise only few oh come on now somebody say Amen what kind of witness are you God will always have a witness because the witness means to testify or something to witness means you can't sit still if God did something for you because the Bible said they overcame by the blood of the lamb and the word of their testimony you've got to have a testimony you've got to have a voice of what God did for you oh Hallelujah do you know overcoming is title you are testifying that's why but the Branham said if you don't testify about this thing you're gonna find yourself back sleeping one day you've got to tell somebody they might call you crazy but you at least got to say God is good at least you gotta say his Mercy endure it forever you at least you gotta say I've never seen the righteous forsaken at least you gotta say he saved me at least you gotta see this message found me at least you could say I didn't do nothing on my own but goodness and mercy follows me all the days of my life oh do you have a reason to testify this morning did he do anything for you has he been keeping you has he raised you up Hallelujah you should have been dead but here you are in the house of God you should have been somewhere else but grace and mercy God will always have a witness it's God's business to have witnesses he loves to take a witness and and shake it in the face of the devil he said there's no one like job oh search the Earth such high search low I can boast about this man called Joba I have a witness on the earth and there's nobody like him in the days of Noah there's nobody like Noah on the face of the hilltop God will always have a witness in Noah's day it was sin everywhere but Noah was God's witness what about our day this morning Hallelujah Hallelujah are you a witness on your job are you with this in your school are you with this in your home are you even a witness in the church are you a witnessing the Maxi are you with us in the taxi we said to the young people yesterday people are so proud to declare what they believe and what they stand for and what side of Defense they on we are the Christians who not afraid to say I'm a Christian deal with it I love the Lord deal with it serve the King of Kings deal with it I dress like a Christian that's who I am deal with it if you want to be my friend these are the terms and conditions that come with my friendship I'm not gonna give up I'm not gonna compromise I'm not gonna drink and smoke I'm not gonna party I'm fit and I'm gonna cuss and I'm gonna no no no no no this is who I am I'm a son of the king I'm a daughter of the king I'm going to the Rapture look at me I'm a prince look at me I'm a princess my father is the king oh come on now [Music] God must have a witness if you are in a certain school it's for you to be a witness if you're in a certain job it's for you to be a witness not a photocopy not a copycat nor to be an individual that God can bless that God could use can the Church Say Amen anybody with me this morning for you to be here this morning somebody had to witness to you you know [Music] amen somebody had to tell you some of you young people who grew up in in church as a your parents bring it to church but ask your parents how they come now ask them how they find the message somebody testify somebody invite them somebody say come to service somebody say hold a book somebody say have you heard about a prophet have you heard about the Lord do you know they can this close at hand somebody did it that's a Great Commission go into holy world and preach a gospel how many people have you testified to how many people have you invited how many have you been told about the Lord Isa bring them to this church necessarily but have you just told everybody Lord have you told them there's a way that's different from the way they're living and that is struggling to go into there's a solution there's a cure that the doctor can write there's a prescription if pharmacist's car right there's a prescription this psychologist's car right there's a prescription in psychiatrist can't write oh Hallelujah there's a joy that you can't buy there's a peace of mind that you can't pay for there's a comfort in the midst of the night that to know that you're sleeping and resting on the Promises of God and though the skin worms destroy this body yet in my flesh I shall see God that's a comfort that comes from knowing who you are and whose you are [Music] anybody here with me this morning [Applause] but I see CPL fans when I tell you who passionate about this cricket team argue and fight them and this and you have to forgive me I really not in the sports I have no problem with it it's just not my thing it's not my calling not gifted in it but when somebody passionate about something that's you see the game you see the play you see this that is the thing they into and whatever the thing is in that into the passionate they can't wait iniminating it if I call somebody and you see that you see what just you see how he catch him that's a kind of excitement like a woman at the at the well when she met Jesus she comes here man you couldn't keep her quiet about it she went to the well many times before but this time she left you well different she said come see a man who told me all about me I've never been this way before she was excited she experienced something she didn't hear about it you know it was her experience and because she experienced it she could get a certain kind of excitement about it that's why I always know when somebody have an experience with God but Ibraham said it makes you act unseemly it makes you act out a character it makes you act a little crazy because you know he wasn't that way before but all of a sudden something happened and then you can't help yourself you're spinning wrong you're dancing you're bouncing your bills still happy but you're happy you know you have problems to deal with but you're not resting on the problem you're resting on the Promises of God and the church amen [Music] [Applause] it's a joy it's a peace it's a comfort that comes from having an experience and that's what we need we need experiences with God not just one experience experiences with God [Applause] because when you have an experience with God nobody could shake you you know because you know you met God you know you experience God you know God did something for you [Music] somebody that's got backslide somebody to do this but you you are unshakable not that you wouldn't have moments when you feel them low David at all kind of encounters I mean say Lord create me a clean heart restore unto me the joy of my salvation he went back to his Source every time he said Lord many are there that increase that trouble me many a day you could see going through something but he's still going back to his Source many a day that say of my soul is no help for him in God but but John oh Lord he keep looking back to his God because that's who he had the experience with [Applause] remember the seven when he experiences at God your job can't shake your your neighbors can't shake your the government can't shake your the economy can't shake your nothing could shake here because you know the source of your supply he is Jehovah Jireh he is Jehovah Rapha he is Jehovah Nissi he is a way maker he is a restorer [Music] [Applause] anybody with me this morning your comfort rests on the Lord not only church not only Pastor it rests in the Lord no Minister could keep you you know it's only the Lord can keep you [Applause] I'm trying to encourage you to get into a relationship with God so you lean on him lean not on your own understanding but you lean on him when you're in your room by yourself and in your job by yourself and all hell against you the person are there with you but God can meet you there [Applause] he can give you the words to say he can give me the Comfort he could give any confidence to give it his strength to stand he can tell you square your shoulders back lift your head up as he caught you red but the man said Shake Yourself come under the dust guard your loins like a man I am with you God's Great desire was to move from God above them to God with them to God in them so you're never walking alone you're walking with God on the inside inside he's sitting on the controlled power of your heart Seated on your throne can the church see amen can we give the Lord a shout out praise God will always have a witness it could be one it could be two it could be five it could be ten but he will always have a witness what we see hasn't impact in our lives I was sharing with you on people yesterday your environment has a lot to do with where you achieve and what you achieve if you want to save money you can't spend your time with people who do not do want to save and spending their money foolish because you will gravitate just like them that's why but I'm saving one the Holy Ghost do what spender people who won the Holy Ghost have the Holy Ghost spend time there if you tell me you won the Holy Ghost how are you spending all the time in the world your environment has a lot to do with what you manifest [Applause] if you spend all your time having worldly conversation that's all you're going to be able to talk about but if you spend your time listening to tapes spending time in prayer spent them in Fellowship around the world it will automatically be Bible say out of the abundance of your heart what you're feeling on that is what you're going to be talking about [Applause] [Music] it's every day you're reading a book every day you listening to our team every day you're playing back these Services all of a sudden you get climbing higher and higher and higher that have nothing to do with anybody else when you come to church you're having your own service because you coming on fire you already in the spirit all week you've been preparing to just get more ammunition to keep on fighting more ammunition depressed for the Holy Ghost [Applause] because you really want God you may be seated I was sharing with young people I went to the barbershop and the normal preacher so they always asking for advice about this advice about this I said listen I hear no advice because the first advice is you have to want to change people want to hear a thing but they don't want to change you know I said

ask God for big things [Applause] Hallelujah you have to forgive me you know they say we ask for little things they asked what for big things you need healing no no don't ask for the healing are you you have two things you see where Lord healing arthritis and you know you have high blood pressure too why are you asking what for one thing [Applause] make a request for the whole thing you know this is like loan consolidation you want financing for all your debt you want to pay off all you want a you want to leave completely and he said how could we have faith for the Rapture if you can have enough faith for Divine Healing so you have to feed for Divine Healing first you have to have faith for your family please live at first because they could really Rapture too [Applause] can the church Say Amen God will always have a witness what we witness what we experience has an undeniable impact on our lives that is why young people it is so important to God what you watch God what you see God what you listen to God your heart for out of it comes all the issues of life [Applause] got it defend it protect it protect your eyes protect your ears some rules you're not supposed to drive down there are shady places you're not supposed to go and nobody could tell me when they start to drive down the wrong road they didn't feel something telling them this is wrong you know because your conscience was given to you as a flashing red light a warning you know in your heart this is this is this is not right and that's why the prophet taught us if there's a question about something leave it alone don't do it run for your life your soul is too important we are way up the road now it's not the time for playing games is there any type of play in church anytime the backslide is any type to experiment with the world what we see what we experience helps to shape Our Lives I challenge young people yesterday you who grew up in church grew up in your message you should be so grateful to God for your parents so thankful to God listen you have to accept the reality there's not everything you're going to agree with agree with your parents you are an individual but it doesn't take away from the fact that the Bible said honor them honor is beyond obedience not just obey but honor give them honor give them respect [Applause] salute them cherish them reference them respect them that's what honor means people want to honor the president the Prime Minister a dignitaries honor your parents [Music] [Applause] this is why it's so important to be conscious of where you go what you do who you spend time with you come to a service like this but all week is spending time in the things of the world you're not going to grow friends you have to want it you have to make a choice to be a Christian when nobody else is around it has nothing to do with them pressing nobody I want to be an individual in God [Applause] can the Church Say Amen God will always have a witness why does God need Witnesses and I share this in Germany in August God is a spirit God is a mystery and in order for God to fulfill his Divine Purpose to reveal himself in this Earthly Dimension he uses Witnesses and by the testimony of these Witnesses we could get a glimpse of the power of God the nature of God the desires of God the intent of God without the ability to interact with Witnesses we wouldn't really understand what God is trying to do could you imagine if everyone who had an encounter with God never said anything about it Joshua was there waiting and and and he heard a Russell and he joined so he said are you false against us it was Joshua and the captain he was alone there was no Paparazzi there if Joshua never told anybody about it we wouldn't know about it when Moses went to the burning bush nobody else was there if Moses didn't tell us what happened but upon you wouldn't know what happened when David was really lying and you overcome the lion he was there was nobody else there but he come and tell us about it when he was having a beer it was him and he beer [Applause] the Lord delivered me that's how we know about it and I want to know what the Lord doing for you because you can't be here this morning if the Lord is doing something for you can the Church Say Amen and it's in little things you know if all the witnesses stayed silent throughout all the ages we would know nothing about Abraham if nobody talked about it we would know about it we will know nothing but Noah we will know nothing but Moses that will just be lost somewhere in history we will know nothing about Joshua David but when these Witnesses understood what they saw understood what they experienced they couldn't stay quiet about it [Music] can the Church Say Amen and these Witnesses were not accidental Witnesses God waited until Abraham was born because he was looking to be a father and he had to wait until he had the right witness in position to display his attribute of being a father oh you don't hear me this morning and by the time God was finished with Abraham Abraham could testify that I am a witness that he is Jehovah Jireh come on now somebody preached back to me and the story of that witness and the testimony of that witness still lives today Abraham was a true witness he was a faithful witness and throughout all the ages there were many witnesses Say Amen when it looks like nobody would stand God will find a witness look at Gideon the people hiding in the caves everything in media nights come they go and hide in the cave yeah Hayden trying to do hiding on your Mighty Man of Allah you didn't know anything about that he looking wrong to see if you're talking about some other Gideon I think he didn't have all his excuse I'm the least in my family my family's the least family any child he's at least tribe of all the tribes but callers looking for witness and in every age you need dark is age he found Luther one man stood against the Catholic church in the darkness he found Wesley in the darkness he found some Bible believe in Pentecostals was a Street Revival in the darkness of this world oh come on now he found a prophet please the prophet as a true Witness so that the son of man could be filled in a son of man to be a witness that Jesus is coming soon and he's coming for a bride and that bribe will also be a witness that he's the same yesterday today and forever that bride will be a witness of the outpouring of the Holy Ghost that wide will be a witness of seeing a super Church come into manifestation she will be a witness of seeing a super race coming to the manifestation [Applause] somebody give what a shout out praise could you take some more [Music] but a troubling part of this friends is like with the lepers who witnessed Jesus many witnessed what God did in Egypt to them but only Joshua and Caleb made it to the promised land many witnessed Jesus performing Miracles you know you remember how much was there for defeated early the five thousand with the Loaves and Fishes five thousand I'm only 120 megade Upper Room so where was the other where was the rest of them but a punch these were Witnesses they all went home and say I was there when I saw Jesus take the lobes on the fishes what a service that was I tell you I've never been a series like that to it so it's not about how long you're in church what you see what you experience you know is what kind of witness are you because out of all of them bridging who was there good to see you brother Jaden God bless you or to all of them who was there only 120 make it to the upper room so what was different about this 120 people said uncomfortable in church come to any message well I have books I have tapes these Believers were in Jesus service not my service [Music] sister olivery they heard Jesus minister they experience five notes which is many were there for different Miracles but out of all those people only 120 make it to the upper room why they didn't show up you ever wonder about that all those left Egypt they saw the Miracles but when it come down to going there when Moses forgetting Ten Commandments they're making Graven image they left Egypt or Egypt was still there so what it teaches us experiences and witness and don't take all the Egypt in your heart to know by type they would have put Blood on the door and thing and and leave Egypt and we go into the Promised Land that's what they left Egypt and they all even we're going to make it see you over Yonder Over Yonder and after that whole group two no that kind of thing brother Jason the shake me to my core because I know I do have Moses Ministry I don't have Jesus ministry and if their Ministries couldn't keep everybody I told young people yesterday but Ibraham said he could preach it a bloody face until it is inspired to you to do what it takes to make your calling an election show [Applause] God will always have a witness and the question is what kind of witness are you and if something is what we have seen happen should the operative order should put our souls in the action it should do it and the fact that but I don't put the word should there means it it'll do it for some it should do it but there'll be those who sit along in church will I any message I I could I I I I believe but you are doing the praying yeah do any sacrifice yeah yeah they're they're fasting here holding on to the horns of the altar you're not trying to live better this week than last week you're not saying Lord cut me shape me make me change me Lord I get so upset last week I don't want to get upset this week the way I get it if I was level 10 upset Lord let me be level eight this week at least let it go down Lord if it take me 10 weeks to get the down to zero get me some Temple Run so tempers can be burnt in Me by experience oh God will do it you can't begin the same Vector was last week this weekend it had to be feed after your faith virtue and knowledge and Temperance and patience you still have no patience after all these years in a message every time you flying off the handle you and you hear any handle they handle here and you hear you're just flying over here you have no relationship with the handle you always find another handle and then you have quickly defend it it wasn't me it was what she said and if she didn't push me I wasn't going to say that it's not cheese any problem you are the problem I am the problem we are the problem Lord shape me Maul me what we have seen happen should put our souls into action to make a church that will make a Revival anybody with me it has to be a change of behavior it has to be a desire what we see happen should make us want to be in church want to be in prayer meet him want to forgive want to love want to manifest these virtues want to be oh come on drop your Orcs worship God [Applause] turn off the television take off the radio forgetting news [Applause] God give us the gospel and by definition that's the good news I want the good news every time you'll put any music negative news that's not edifying I want to be reminded of the goodness of Jesus can you say Amen [Applause] I've been written here many witness Jesus performing Miracles but only 120 made it to the upper room Friends The Upper Room the whole of Jerusalem knew about Jesus or to better me or to Samaria every you name it brother popwell they all knew they were there saying Hosanna Hosanna they wear Palms they had a Tribunal give us Barabbas give us Jesus to enter all of that they heard about Lazarus on the Dead they hear Jesus walking water some of them saw these things Jesus was telling someone I'm telling no man what happened Jairus daughter if you're counting mathematics and this service with five thousand but a punching Nexus had more you know a bunch of seven thousand not content and the Bible said nothing woman and children but 120 made it to the upper room what kind of witness are you what we see should bring a change in our lives the Bible speaks about Isaiah leaning on King Uzziah Isaiah was a priest he was a prophet and when Uzziah died and he went to the temple and when he said I saw the Lord and when he came to the presence of God he experienced something that made him trembling made him shake and make him realize as he got closer to the presence of God he started to see things he never saw about himself and he came to a point said why is me I'm a man of unclean lips and that's a prophet that his experiences Sister Paulina to push him to a place to have a different kind of experience a personal experience to say Lord I have some issues in my life I need to change he said well it's me I'm I'm undone I'm a man of unclean lips I have some issues to fix he wasn't embarrassed he said I'm a prophet I'm a priest I really don't want to say it and I'll put it in words that I have issues I said technicals cleanse my lips here I am I don't want to go back home the same way that I came and experience and make you want to get a change [Applause] some of us come to the presence of God and you know you have things to make right but you want to go back home because you don't want anybody see you at the altar you don't want nobody see you're crying you're the one really think you have some stuff going on well I've got news here I have stuff going on [Applause] if God could tell the prophet of God you need to be more sincere who are you who am I God could tell the man of God on the Earth has tiny right hand of God there was no man on the earth like the prophet after the Lord Jesus Christ and he can look at that man and say you need to be more sincere [Applause] I need to be more sincere we need to be more sincere we need to be more consecrated we need to be more dedicated we need to be more honest and say Lord I need our help I need a touch and not where I'm supposed to be Lord [Applause] before Isaiah's encounter he thought he was a righteous that statement war is me it's like whoa whoa whoa I didn't realize the light that just shown on show me some stuff about that and realize what's the issue and that's why friends God will send experiences your way the show things you didn't know was there he'll shake up your house he'll she 'll shake up your family heal shake up your job he will shake things up to make you uncomfortable because it's when you're uncomfortable you'll get to see what stuff you're really made of [Applause] because these virtues have to live and God has to prove it that it's in you and the devil the prophet said will also test to see what's in you [Applause] will you forgive will you love don't to be very any Prophet is tested he's in church preaching the young couple making love in church and God again gave his Prophet options just like he gives us a happy right option God will always give you options you know he said whatever you say to them will happen say blindness to go blind God give him Choice A B C D and he probably said none of the above I forgive you none of the above this multiple choice is none of the above and God said that's the character looking for that's in nature looking for because I could trust you with more power because God wants to forgive he's a god of judgment he's a god of judgment he's a judgment seat but blood makes it a mercy seat this morning so there's Mercy For You Mercy for me but he's a judge he's a righteous judge thank you but there's Mercy this morning for your soul Mercy for your family that if you're living out of the will of God you can get black in line with God and mercy could minister to you [Applause] [Music] I said it a few weeks ago many of us we are so caught up with ourselves we can't even see that we're entering into somebody else's pain God's way for you is through that I can look down at nobody there's nobody better than anybody in the room you know we all need a blood we all need Mercy we all here by his grace God cannot choose anybody God cannot give anybody to speak he is he won't give any gift nobody actually if you didn't ask to be on the earth you didn't put yourself here you had nothing to do with your conception you had nothing to do with you being here you couldn't plan it you couldn't stop it but God too for knowledge he predestinated that you'll be here who if only we called who we call it Justified and we justify he hath already past tense glorified we are walking in a story that's been already written and the devil has no access to the book The Devil can read the book he doesn't know your name is written it's Written in Blood and Jesus said all that the father has given me they must come they will come no devil could stop it your past can't stop it your mama can't stop it your papa can't stop it the Devil Himself can't stop it you belong to God your name is written in the Lamb's Book of Life In The Blood section you could try to walk away but Mercy will always say no [Music] that's a reason to shout that's the reason the praise God he said no weapon from against you could ever prosper [Music] Keep Holding On keep fighting keep pressing God is going to work it out [Applause] come on Church Give the Lord a shout Our Praise come on say root this is your service this is your time this is your season don't let it pass you by e yes but Ashby God is going to have a witness I want to be a witness I want to be a witness are you going to be a witness are you going to be a living testimony [Applause] that shakes the devil it's a live voice that's the witness that God is looking for a lived voice [Applause] [Music] can the Church Say Amen Give the Lord a shout out praise Give Him worship this morning oh Hallelujah [Applause] could you take some more [Applause] so Isaiah's experience with God is not that he didn't know according to him God unspoken then he's a prophet but God wants more not just more you know he wants all he wants everything he wants your hands he wants your feet he wants your eyes he wants your lips he wants your worship he wants your commitment he wants your passion he wants your energy he wants you all he wants you all he wants everything [Music] I told the young people yesterday all the things you're looking for in life is directly tied to your ability to surrender to God [Applause] you think you want is connected to surrender because the more you give up and surrender God is is like a pipe I give you analogy yesterday's like a pipe you ever open a pie that was clogged it's not even water not there no but there's something blocking me pipe but you clear you clog any pipe brother Papa don't know what happens the water just flows automatically because the water wants to flow but if something blocking the pipe then you water can't flow so you get a

somebody give God a shout out praise [Music] he may be seen if God could take a dead Lazarus out of the grave Lazarus wasn't praying Lazarus was insane deliver me Lazarus wasn't bleeding at the altar so I don't care what your child is doing right now [Music] [Applause] I don't care if they even talking to God if they care about God if a dead man could come back to life because of the fate of those

get a restoration of your joy but not just a restoration of your joy to get a new Joy of refilling of Joy a new experience a fresh anointing a fresh charge a fresh encounter with you she offered me a fresh walk with God as when you please believe but now you're climbing high up the mountain you need something to keep on pressing yes this is that day this is that service this is that season not just more information but an experience word and spirit together foreign [Applause] but the spirit is what brings life could you take some more God wants to use you he has no hands but your hands he has no feet but your feet [Applause] [Music] Ethiopian eunuch was reading the word and couldn't understand it God had a choice he could have gone and met that man but he sent Philip because he had somebody on the earth who had the sea germ the life itself in the body [Applause] so God will not do what he could delegate [Music] [Applause] [Music] the relationship with your children with your family might be strained but God wants to delegate to you and give you such a transformation that those you can't reach now will wonder what happened to you they will say is this is this not Joseph's son could anything good come out of Nazareth I thought I know this man I thought I know this woman but something must have happened because you're talking differently your approach is different your life is different [Applause] you wouldn't have to say anything about it the prophet said it will speak for [Music] so because God had fill up on the earth he moved Philip he translated Philip from a Revival to meet the youth European eunuch to reveal to him the word what he was reading [Applause] and this Bible is a closed book without the prophet don't try to take away my prophet there's nothing we could preach in this Bible if it was done for the prophet iron up the Loose Ends revealing every mystery bringing the word it's a plain view not just Clarity of the full picture of God but what was needed for us to prepare ourselves for the rapture [Applause] [Music] [Applause] we are not trying to preach our understanding of it our interpretation of it our feelings about it the way we think God meant no God is The Interpreter of his own word and that's why we say what the tape say [Applause] everybody feeling fine everybody enjoying the world we here for the day right don't worry we have some little food afterwards the totally young people is under Buffet he's not a restaurant but a little sustenance to keep us going Our Lives don't belong to us you know [Applause] listen the more you acknowledge God I was sharing with you on people I did a a prayer meeting a few weeks ago about Hannah and I said Hannah's Prayer activated something in God has a vested interest in displaying his power that's why when you read his Bible and you see them pray men pray because they understood God they say Lord is your name they they will bring no he said they beefing with your name they say let not your name be taken down or not and when you pray like that God does feel a certain way about it because God has a vested interest them Ben of all Brothers you say pray Lord is not not about us not even for us but for your name come and fight this battle to Save Your Name Lord you know we messed up but your name don't let our messen up mess up your name because your name is higher than every other name yo and when they talk like that God says send angels open the inventory send soldiers so that's why even that's why I have to know how to pray Samson and say oh God lord and they say Lord hear what now avenge me of my two eyes in other words I didn't put it is you put the ice them take out your eyes they had no right Lord I know I messed upon them but they have no right to come and take all the eyes that you put in who these people feel they are that they got high that you put in and when you talk like that God say you know you're right is I put them eyes there how come these Philistines God and take all the eyes that I bought it all you don't hear me deceived who gave them the right to take out the eye that I put there come the church semen and the devil had no right to come in your house he had no right to come in your body he had no wrong come on now to touch your children that's why we have the authority to take them back [Music] the devil has no right [Applause] [Music] [Applause] don't touch this bride don't touch this family don't touch this house [Music] in other words friends don't let your sins and your mistakes and your failures keep you back from calling on God [Applause] [Music] [Applause] I hope this helped build your feet this morning you know remember that Andrew hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah Glory [Applause] start to look at your hands in front of them but at balance it takes a little bit of confidence to look at the Devil and say Boo I'm pretty you know because the devil is one used to shut up you just want you to take a preaching like a trillion is but when did they say poo the devil do expect you to respond because your whole life you're taking licks all kind of stress all kind of pressure he think you want to beat into subjection like those children of Israel were in Egypt all right but he mommy didn't say boo back whatever gets smaller and when you see that little move that'll change your power listen you're ready so if you see me walk around church after service saying boo look at this with me I'm watching devil shrink boo boo boo boo I that's how I walk into my house now boo let them take out crazy I don't care I don't care I'm taking back what the devil took from me every place every place that shows up your feet train that time I shocked I'm trying to find a place to close off this morning I hope is this helping anybody this morning you may be seated so many people had experiences with God we have spoken a lot about positive experiences I want to remind us that not ex every experience with God is positive you know brother random taught us when you come to the house of God you will never leave the sin he said he will either get better or you'll get worse [Music] can I say that one more time whenever you come to the house of God you will never leave the same you will either live better or you will leave worse and one day Jesus is preaching and there's a young man sitting there in the church and maybe close to the end of the service he must us up the courage to approach Jesus with Anthony preach a beautiful message in 2013 I believe around this subject what lack I yet and this Rich Young Ruler waited for his turn as it were to say good master from my youth I've observed the Commandments I've done all these things what what a neater this eternal life thing friends what an experience to talk to Jesus and to get her answer we pray and we talk to God and we lord we want to hear from you and this Rich Young Ruler had the opportunity to sit and talk and stand and have a conversation with Jesus and it wasn't as if he had to hope to get an answer Jesus responded and he told this young man he saw the sincerity in his heart he said go sell all you have and give to the poor what a what a thing to not only talk to Jesus from Jesus and him and to get a plan of action of naughty things you may have to do you know religious but the exact thing to do it is not that he left the service I already sure what I need to do next he was told exactly what he had to do next [Applause] the Bible said Jesus loved him was love that and the Bible said this man left hope sorrowful because he was not willing to do what it took to change his life anybody who spoke to that man after the surface who was looking because I would have imagined this was a private conversation hey you you spoke to Jesus I wish I had a chance to get to I didn't get to talk to him brother how was it how is it how is it to talk to Jesus what you wanted to know what did you ask him what did he tell you testify about it I wonder what this man was saying if he could have even said that he could have even repeated it how come you look inside didn't you just talk to Jesus everybody else who we saw with Jesus left rejoicing the woman whose daughter was vet with the devil if you see how she rejoice do you remember the issue of blood if you see how she rejoice this Centurion who said enough to go to my house just speak the word brother what happened to you he was a witness he had an experience but he was unwilling to do what was required to get his life in order with the Lord if there ever was an example to us this is not my Ministry but the oven Ministry the prophet Ministry this was Jesus himself this is not there's somebody in the audience who need to sell what they have and give this is not that this is not a somebody with a back pain there's somebody with a headache out of 100 200 you must have somebody with a headache this wasn't that there's somebody here who lost a pen this was done that this was Jesus Discerning love discerning and writing a prescription that you need to go to the pharmacy and fulfill and do what it takes you have to take the tablet you have to take the therapy you have to cut all the sugar you have to stop it in Salt you have to exercise 30 minutes a day you have stuff you need to do [Applause] and he left sorrowful not willing to do it because it was a deep issue in his heart when you come to the house of God you either live better or you're left worse that man left worse how will you leave the service today musicians get ready I have one more for you and this is one it is a message I enjoy preaching the most is this one because it blew my mind out of Jesus's Ministry what he chose to highlight in his ministry I preach many times Jesus never in his preaching said remember David remember Joshua remember Elijah remember no the only commandment he said was remember Lord's wife he's single her out specifically not by name but by role he could have identified a name he chose to leave a nameless because this wife is a is a is a is a avatar it's a it's a person it's a it's a it's a place people in this place are being lost wife you know and how did it play out the Bible says that this situation was a natural problem between lot's family of Abraham's family and Abraham being the bigger man said you choose to speak about this as well and Lord pitch his tent towards Sodom but he didn't consider the effects of his decision because the Bible said when you study it a lot was strong enough because he was at the gate and then Peter Peter Justified him and said blood was bothered by the filthy conversation in Sodom so he wasn't being influenced by there but his wife and children were exposed to it what lot could have handled his wife and family could not have handled and this is the call and a warning to the fathers and the leaders in the house you might be able to handle decisions that you make but you have to think of the second order consequences what about your wife what about your children what about your family our actions affect other people am I speaking to anybody this morning and the way God operates just like the Ethiopian you're not where God had fill upon the Earth God said I'm not gonna touch Sodom and Gomorrah without talking to my man and he got to have a witness his name is Abraham before I do anything let me bring Abraham any Luke she said shall I hide from Abraham what I'm about to do in other words I respect my man on the ground you say Abraham this is what I'm about to do I'm about to go on this choice of the mangamore hold up hold up I have family I have loved ones I know this situation bad but oh gosh if at least he has 50. spare them now I'm a child in trouble holding on for them I'm holding on that I love a lot a lovely Families my family I don't want to see them lost I don't want to I just want to go to the Rapture and say fire upon them no that's not true that is that's not being a Christian Abraham could I say like some of us Chinese where they make a bad day like lying it he saw that let me reap it let me reap it reap It Bun them that's not the Christian way and Abraham plea and he said Lord oh gosh if there's no 50 of his team is twenty if it's too deep it's twenty Xavier's even 10. he looked into place insurance policies he wants to mitigate the risk as far as he could he risk and they couldn't even find 10 right just in the Old City and because God's love for his servant Abraham you don't think God honors your prayer your sacrifice your faithfulness because of Abraham's love do you understand that the angel that went to Sodom and Gomorrah was because of Abraham that if Abraham did not plea for them these things they would not have gone I want you to understand this for you parents who want to give up on your children that you're pleading for your children dispatches angels [Applause] [Music] when you can reach them the Angels could reach them and the Bible give the type of when Daniel stopped praying the Angels stop fighting so whatever you do keep on praying keep in faith keep believing keep pleading and watch God do the rest I'm getting ready to close out so because of love God dispatched two angels to go into Solomon Gomorrah and as they are coming lot is at the gate biblically the business center he not with only back now he's there he's mining his business he's trying to defeat his family and he observes the two men and he knows just by the way they walk in the different their countenance their son he recognized he know his losses Are Spiritual enough to know these men come from God and you know when they meet somebody who come from God you know you know we are playing games your spiritual being and he decides to take these men at the gates I said to carry them to his house and in the journey the filthy Sodom and gomorians whatever you want to call them see these men sodomites and say we want to lie with them a lot have to go and hide them in his house and the Bible said the men of the village surrounded lot house to get these men Lots concerned for these men of God was so great that he offered his two virgin daughters to the men and the men of the city they say we don't want them girls we want the men who just came in and Jesus said as it was in the days so shall it be what day is we living in we're not playing games it's a reality we're living in hell and people are born to declaring ball the same ball to stand out about it and you say I want to keep my skirt on me and you fight them with that foolishness still baby steps you still in for this yeah whenever the child is picking the child when there was a childless things when when I go grew up Satan's kingdom come into maturity you know we have to come to maturity then climb the pyramid and get to adoption we can't be playing in standard one the devil has a thousands of years to get the University degree in them the Bible says and this way I want to get the Lord's wife so lots of wives did cook a little food the Angels friends the Richer ruler met Jesus Lord's wife Entertaining Angels but I see when you have to know his angels and if you didn't know the Bible said that after a while when either get fed up of again knocking on the door but upon what they do they walk outside and they're blinded all the men so if Lot's wife didn't know it was an angel then see God move and see somebody in my house there's a anointing here never see this before and [Applause] many saw the prophet and they don't even believe the message anymore the Bible said when they blinded these men all night long these Blind Men running around the house trying to find it all and you want to let your children go to your house without praying and you want to walk down and go to work without praying you so big and bad that you could go out there anywhere without committing your life to the Lord before you leave your house you that strapped you that ready that you ready to go all day without the Lord when the land of hell is open and streams of demon powers walk in the earth you want to risk going out there without saying Lord cover my child where your blood cover me on the road with your blood government will work with your blood cover me everywhere in your blood protect his home protect my coming out we're going in he said the angel of the Lord and come around those are clear Lord may you dispatch Angels you heard such a rajkumar's testimony she got to her house a car pull in front of her she don't know what to do watch your movies [Music] with the craziness the home invasions going on around new country I said to the young people there was a time people respected the mature on the old and his senior citizens not the coughing 85 year old woman in the head to take three dollars and but a Branham said right now love is on the earth you know he said when the bride lives in a Rapture log will go with the bride I don't know there'll be no love in here to know so if what we are seeing is actions and behaviors with love being here what would it be when love leaves with the bride and you don't want to have a relationship with God after what we have seen what we see should put our souls into action Every Soul I'm trying to close out let's bring this home so Lot's wife sees blind man the Angels plead the Angels the Bible said because lot had more than two girls he had multiple children because the Bible said he went to his sons-in-laws so these were the boys were married to his other daughters and the Bible said they laughed and mocked him read the Bible we did this in a Bible study and lot is so anxious now he is there trying to get them until the Bible said the Angels physically grabbed them and pull them out this is the way caller extraction so a lot his wife and his two daughters have to walk out and they are given one instruction Don't Look Back In other words don't backslide Don't Turn back don't go back into the world don't play games if you leave this service make up your mind to not look back make up your mind I don't care about yesterday last week last month last year 20 years ago make up your mind from this day forward I'm Not Looking Back I'm looking to Calvary I'm looking to my retention I'm looking to the Holy Ghost I'm looking to be a lived voice I'm looking to add these virtues I'm looking to live above sin I've said it many times but the Branham taught us you could live in such a way the devil don't even know what to do with you thank you you can begin to play something Softly I can start to walk out walk out I can imagine maybe a lot is leading them out because the Lord spoke a lot he said follow me let's go the angel said here's the Escape Theater in other words don't stroll don't stroll out but the brother would stand there in the Tabernacle and he says when God come to you say respond quickly he said if you don't respond fast enough the angel moves away but Anthony didn't he teach us this when you feel the talk of God in your heart just respond quickly these are told I'm here skip to the run for your life so lot is moving come on come on let's go let's go let's go let's go let's go and while they're walking out fire is falling over Sodom and Gomorrah judgment striking behind her I said come on don't look back don't look back why if you're good daughter say good let's go let's go let's go it wasn't easy for a lot he was leaving his other children behind his children had reach a point where they made their own decision he had done all he could do [Music] but a Madam taught us there's a line that after while they cross the line there's no hope he taught us do not cross the line he said I see a day where the young people at the altar praying crying and no help for them no hope for them because they don't cross in line it's too late no more salvation for them that's a quote I preach that do not cross the line so there's Mercy is not a always last and mercy said seek you the Lord while he may be found call upon him while he is near there's always been a time limit [Applause] I don't know who this is for today I don't know he knew who needs to hear this today but God knows my heart I don't want to miss it and I don't want you to miss it and after a while imagine and this to me is the painful part of this lot is calling for his wife honey you're there and there's no answer and by the Mikey you know it's the hard part you can't even look back to see if she's all right you have to deny your very Instinct because our instinct is you okay we can't even do that you have to keep walking [Music] sister a lot had seen enough to keep on walking there was nothing for her left in Sodom it was being destroyed behind her what was she looking for what did she want to go back to what do you want to go into the world for why would you leave this service and go and live the same way you lived last week last month last year why would you go back and dress the same way live the same way act to see me go back into it be disrespectful to your parents disrespectful be be indifferent in your marriage be having no prayer life whatever it is for you you know what it is don't go back dear friends [Music] can we stand I didn't get to finish the message but I believe the message got home
