[34:03] other man's office some evangelist and
[34:06] some pastors some teachers remember
[34:08] speaking about human Thim and remember

[34:13] Juda and all those things were placed
[34:16] you know none couldn't be out of order
[34:19] you know it was 12 tribes and there was
[34:21] a head of the three tribes represented
[34:24] there by lion ox man and Eagle because
[34:26] that is what was wrong with to throne
[34:28] amen so God is not just doing things
[34:30] halfhazard everything have to come in
[34:33] position and in order sir for things to
[34:36] take place so that's why the prophet
[34:38] said the angel of the Lord is on earth
[34:40] now fixing things around now you can't
[34:43] fix like God could fix you can't know
[34:46] what to put here and set here that's why
[34:48] you have to believe Romans 8:28
[34:50] Hallelujah that all things work together
[34:52] for good praise God so when God closed
[34:55] this door because God don't want the
[34:58] behind that door to get to you so he
[35:00] blocked that door for you not to damage
[35:03] yourself that's why God closed that door
[35:05] is that because he don't like you and he
[35:07] have a problem with you that's not the
[35:09] door for you to go through he have
[35:11] another door for you because he is
[35:14] always a way maker he has proved himself
[35:16] to be a way maker especially when there
[35:18] is no
[35:19] way especially when there is no way God
[35:25] makes a way

[44:54] that your prayer means nothing your
[44:56] prayer is not wasted I've heard the
[44:58] cries of my people I heard the cries of
[45:01] my people there is prayer that God hear
[45:04] they are prayer that God is
[45:10] answer so listen to this my the very
[45:15] word labor signifies awarness through
[45:18] oppression God's people do not only work
[45:20] for him in a labor of love but they
[45:23] suffer for him with joy they are patient
[45:26] in being the Yoke the first aid suffered
[45:29] great persecution Hallelujah it had to
[45:31] work hard to preach the gospel to shed
[45:34] forth truth their High Calling in life
[45:37] was to serve God and when their hopes in
[45:40] life were blighted
[45:43] Hallelujah here this bum when their
[45:45] hopes in life were
[45:48] blighted they were patient and committed
[45:51] all to him who had promised a last
[45:55] recompense in heaven for what they had
[45:58] given up for him on Earth amen I think
[46:00] we ought to stop here and deal with the
[46:02] thought that God people have always been
[46:05] and always will be
[46:07] persecuted you know from Genesis in the
[46:09] book of the beginnings and what you find
[46:11] started there will carry on right
[46:13] through to Revelation and never change
[46:15] amen there we see Cain persecuted and
[46:18] kill Abel because the latter pleased God
[46:21] then we see the perfect picture in
[46:22] Abraham son of the flesh Ismael who
[46:24] teased and fought the son of promis
[46:26] Isaac there was Esau who hated Jacob I
[46:30] would have killed him had not God
[46:32] intervened and in the New Testament we
[46:34] find Judas betraying Jesus while the
[46:37] religious orders of the first century
[46:39] attempted to destroy the early Believers
[46:41] the children of this world controlled by
[46:44] the
[46:45] devil hate the children of God that are
[46:49] controlled by the spirit amen so no
[46:52] matter how just and upright a Christian
[46:54] is before the public and how gracious he
[46:57] is to his fellow man doing not but good
[47:01] let him confess Christ as his Savior and
[47:03] acknowledge the operation of the gifts
[47:05] of the holy spirit in tongues and
[47:07] prophecy healing and miracles and he
[47:09] will be condemned amen the spirit of
[47:12] this world hates the spirit of God Amen
[47:15] that's just plain as it is and because
[47:19] it can't here we
[47:22] go because it can't overcome the spirit
[47:26] of God Amen it can't it tries to destroy
[47:33] the vessel in whom the spirit of Truth
[47:38] dwells so whatever Spirit it have
[47:40] outside of second Peter 1 14-7 cannot
[47:43] overcome that because that was the
[47:46] voices that overcome in every age there
[47:49] was a triumphant anointing that God
[47:51] released upon his elect in every age to
[47:54] overcome the devil even in the Dark Ages
[47:58] the ox anointing was upon the people to
[48:01] ride through even so amen I commit my
[48:04] spirit into your hands Lord Jesus and
[48:06] they burn them at the stake and they
[48:07] overcome the Devil Couldn't frustrate
[48:09] them from giving up their lives from
[48:11] being burned at the stake from being
[48:13] crucified upside down from being Amen in
[48:16] the Lion's Den but they stood their
[48:18] ground and we going to stand our ground
[48:22] because God give us the ability to stand
[48:25] before God make a fish you had put water
[48:27] for the fish to swim in and before God
[48:29] put us in this a he had to put something
[48:31] in us to face what we have to face I
[48:36] will not believe otherwise it's already
[48:39] built in once it have a Goliath there is
[48:43] a damid
[48:49] somewhere Glory don't tell me about
[48:51] Goliath tell me where is
[48:54] David Hallelujah
[48:58] persecution and trials a natural and
[49:01] normal part of Christian Life there's
[49:03] only one thing you can do about them
[49:05] commit them all to God judge not and
[49:09] leave their outworking and final
[49:11] judgment to him thou can not bear them
[49:13] which are evil thou has try them which
[49:16] say they Apostles and are not and has
[49:18] found them Liars right these Ephesians
[49:22] believe that God's people ought to be
[49:24] holy am there's going to be another Epi
[49:29] Ephesians Hallelujah let me repeat it
[49:31] again these Ephesians believe that God's
[49:33] people ought to be holy according to
[49:36] this verse they took steps to keep the
[49:39] body unle from sin most evidently the
[49:43] apost had apostasy had already started
[49:46] sin had entered into the church but they
[49:48] were obedient to the words of Paul when
[49:51] he said to put away the wicked from
[49:53] amongst them they were a separated
[49:55] people had the world they had come out
[49:57] of the world and now they weren't going
[49:59] to let the world enter amongst them they
[50:02] this the part I want to get to they
[50:05] would not put up with sin in the church
[50:09] Holiness wasn't a phrase with them or a
[50:14] figure of speech it was a way of
[50:18] life let me repeat that Holiness wasn't
[50:22] a phrase or a
[50:24] quote on with them or a figure of speech
[50:28] it was a way of life thou has tried them
[50:31] with say the apostles and are not has
[50:33] found them Liars my that is a blunt
[50:36] statement that was try them who were
[50:38] call Apostles isn't that presumptuous
[50:40] what right has a people to try those who
[50:43] call themselves Apostles how do they try
[50:46] them oh I love this here it is in
[50:48] Galatians 1: 18 though we or an angel
[50:52] from heaven preach any other gospel unto
[50:56] you
[50:57] that which we have already preached unto
[50:59] you let him be a curse watch it was the
[51:03] apostles who brought the original word
[51:06] to the people that original word could
[51:09] not change not even a DOT or a dash no
[51:14] mistakes no error nothing god is perfect
[51:18] God is not a man that would lie he has a
[51:22] word that is perfect His prophets are
[51:24] the mpce of God
[51:27] Hallelujah watch watch Paul knew it was
[51:31] God who had spoken to him so he said if
[51:35] even I come and try to give a second
[51:39] Revelation to make a change from the one
[51:42] I originally give let me be a curse you
[51:45] see Paul knew the first revelation was
[51:48] correct God can't
[51:51] give a first revelation and then a
[51:54] second Revelation if he did he would be
[51:57] changing his mind he can give a
[51:59] revelation and then add to it as he did
[52:02] in the Garden of Eden when he promised
[52:03] the seed of the woman and then later
[52:05] designated that seed to come to Abraham
[52:07] and then later said it would come to the
[52:08] Bloodlines of David but it was the same
[52:11] Revelation it only give the people more
[52:13] information to help them receive and
[52:16] understand it but God's word can't
[52:19] change the seed came exactly as be
[52:22] revealed and these and you see what
[52:24] those false apostles were doing they
[52:26] they cared they came with their own word
[52:29] those Ephesians knew what that word that
[52:32] Paul as Paul taught it they were full of
[52:34] the Holy Ghost by the laying on of
[52:36] Paul's hands they looked those false
[52:38] Apostles in the eye and said you are not
[52:40] saying what Paul said therefore you are
[52:43] false oh that sets my heart on fire get
[52:47] back to the word it is not you that
[52:50] really tries the Apostle and prophet and
[52:52] teacher it's the word that tries them
[52:56] amen Oh Glory to God that's why it can't
[52:58] be little me and big you it have to be
[53:00] Sons and Daughters of God till we all
[53:02] come into the unity of the faith and
[53:04] those believers they wasn't afraid to
[53:06] check out who say they Apostle and check
[53:08] out who say they a prophet and check out
[53:10] who say they a teacher because the mouth
[53:11] say they're teacher there that my
[53:13] goodness is not like that brother has to
[53:16] be the word has to be the word living
[53:18] and thundering could we all stand and

[56:57] much for the special this morning so I
[56:59] like to go straight to the word
[57:01] greetings in the precious name of Jesus
[57:04] Christ and Welcome to our Sunday morning
[57:07] service I just want to read two portions
[57:10] of scripture reading from Second
[57:13] Chronicles chapter
[57:15] 20 and reading from Isaiah
[57:19] 55 for two portions of scripture
[57:29] 2
[57:30] Chronicles chter 20 and verse
[57:40] 15
[57:42] hallelu and this is the spirit of the
[57:45] Lord in the midst of the
[57:47] congregation saying and he said Haren ye
[57:50] all Judah and ye inhabitants of
[57:53] Jerusalem and Thou King Jehoshaphat
[57:56] thus sayeth the Lord unto you be Not
[57:58] Afraid nor dismayed by reason of this
[58:02] great multitude for the battle is not
[58:05] yours but
[58:07] God's and read from Isaiah 55 and
[58:10] reading from verse 6 seek ye the Lord
[58:14] while he may be found call ye upon him
[58:16] while he is near let the wicked forsake
[58:19] his way and the unrighteous man his
[58:21] thoughts and let him return unto the
[58:23] Lord for he will have mercy upon him and
[58:26] to our God for he will abundantly pardon
[58:30] for my thoughts are not your thoughts
[58:32] neither are your ways my ways sayeth the
[58:35] Lord for as the heavens are higher than
[58:37] the earth so are my ways higher than
[58:39] your ways and my thoughts than your
[58:42] thoughts for as the rain cometh down and
[58:44] the snow from heaven and returneth not
[58:47] fither but WTH the Earth and make it it
[58:50] bring forth and Bud that it may give
[58:52] seed to the S and bread to the eater so
[58:55] shall my word that goeth forth out of my
[58:57] mouth it shall not return unto me void
[59:01] but it shall accomplish that which I
[59:02] please and it shall prosper in the thing
[59:05] with to I sent it may the Lord add a
[59:08] blessing to the reading of his word you
[59:10] may be seated amen amen everybody
[59:14] feeling
[59:15] fine everybody happen to be in the
[59:17] presence of the Lord so I always say and
[59:20] brother bam actually said he said it's
[59:21] easy to talk about what God did in the
[59:24] past it's easy to preach about what he's
[59:26] going to do but it takes some great
[59:29] faith to speak about what he's doing
[59:30] right now and you have to realize that
[59:33] no matter what trial test situation
[59:36] problem persecution what you can't
[59:39] understand God is doing something right
[59:41] now and in the message taken s side with
[59:44] Jesus brother brandham said these tapes
[59:46] this message will fall into the hands of
[59:49] the
[59:50] predestinated so the fact that the
[59:52] message fell into your hands means
[59:54] something about you and bovid said it
[59:57] last Sunday and I was saying it uh in
[1:00:00] maraval on Tuesday night I said it's so
[1:00:02] amazing uh that there's a president
[1:00:05] elect in the US and no matter your
[1:00:07] feelings or opinions the reality is come
[1:00:11] January Donald Trump will become
[1:00:13] president of the US whether you voted
[1:00:16] for him or didn't vote for him whether
[1:00:18] you think he's qualified or he's not
[1:00:20] qualified it doesn't change the fact
[1:00:22] that he's destined to go into power and
[1:00:24] mov brought it out last week that
[1:00:26] there's a vote that already took place
[1:00:28] way back before there was a moon before
[1:00:31] there was a world before there was a
[1:00:33] star and there are some people who
[1:00:34] didn't vote for you they didn't elect
[1:00:35] you they don't think you could make it
[1:00:37] they don't think you're qualified but
[1:00:39] there's only one vote that's important
[1:00:41] this morning and who he found you he
[1:00:44] elected and who he elected he called and
[1:00:47] who he call he already justify it
[1:00:50] doesn't matter what the devil thinks
[1:00:51] what your family thinks what your body
[1:00:54] thinks what your mind thinks what your
[1:00:56] past says about you you maybe see that
[1:00:58] there are people who speak about his
[1:00:59] past and his past is not stopping him
[1:01:01] from hitting his throne what about your
[1:01:03] past hitting a different kind of Throne
[1:01:05] you are promised to be somewhere this
[1:01:08] morning and that place is in God's
[1:01:10] kingdom and no devil could stop it no
[1:01:13] protest could stop it no demon could
[1:01:15] stop it because you are promis and
[1:01:17] inheritance can the church say
[1:01:20] Amen so I have a very interesting title
[1:01:23] this morning and it's taken Direct IR ly
[1:01:26] from The Prophet's message in a message
[1:01:27] to guide and I want to read the quote
[1:01:29] and I'm going to refer to it uh quite a
[1:01:31] few times uh but in the message to guide
[1:01:34] brother brandham said God has never
[1:01:36] changed his strategy and Satan has never
[1:01:40] changed his so my title this morning is
[1:01:44] God has never changed his strategy and
[1:01:48] my subject the battle is not yours and
[1:01:51] my inspiration Jesus Christ the same
[1:01:54] yesterday the same today and forever can
[1:01:56] the church say Amen so what is a
[1:01:59] strategy a strategy is a plan of action
[1:02:03] designed to achieve a long-term or
[1:02:05] overall Aim so there are many dimensions
[1:02:08] to strategy in business there's
[1:02:09] strategic planning but the word strategy
[1:02:12] is most connected with war because a
[1:02:15] general has to have a strategy for his
[1:02:17] army to win the battle and the God we
[1:02:20] serve is a Master General and he also
[1:02:22] has a strategy to win the battle but
[1:02:25] there's a beautiful part of this whole
[1:02:27] strategy the battle is not
[1:02:30] yours but it's the Lord's you might be
[1:02:33] on the Battle Ground but it's not your
[1:02:35] battle you might be in the battlefield
[1:02:38] but it's not your battle you may have
[1:02:40] been given a sword to fight but it's not
[1:02:42] your battle you have been told to put on
[1:02:44] the armor of the Lord but it's not your
[1:02:46] battle you have been asked to grow up
[1:02:48] into a certain stature but it's not your
[1:02:51] battle you may get wounded you may get
[1:02:53] cut but it's not your battle you may may
[1:02:55] be battle scared you may be tired but
[1:02:58] it's not your battle you're going to
[1:02:59] have to fight but it's not your
[1:03:02] battle being caught up in the fight
[1:03:05] doesn't make it your battle but this
[1:03:07] morning the battle is not yours but it's
[1:03:10] the Lord's and when the Lord appears on
[1:03:13] the scene brother popwell it's a
[1:03:15] different story because you will realize
[1:03:17] that everything in scripture is strategy
[1:03:20] you may be seated I said to them in
[1:03:22] maraval on Tuesday night God existed by
[1:03:24] himself and in order to fulfill his
[1:03:27] strategy of being a Healer he had to
[1:03:29] have a long-term
[1:03:31] plan Hallelujah a plan of action to
[1:03:35] achieve a long-term aim he was there by
[1:03:38] himself and he realized that there was
[1:03:40] nobody to heal so God in the back part
[1:03:42] of his mind say let me make a strategy
[1:03:45] to heal somebody I need to get a
[1:03:47] strategy to deliver somebody there's got
[1:03:50] to be somebody backsliding but I got to
[1:03:52] get a strategy to deliver the backslider
[1:03:56] and God in his mind because he's not
[1:03:58] from time he's in eternity so he's
[1:04:01] moving back and forth he's in all the
[1:04:04] years he's in all the ages he's in all
[1:04:06] the times and he said for this strategy
[1:04:08] to be
[1:04:10] unfolded you may be
[1:04:13] seated
[1:04:15] Hallelujah one of the greatest strategy
[1:04:17] games is a game of chess you have
[1:04:20] different pieces on the board not just
[1:04:22] different pieces but different pieces
[1:04:23] could only move in certain ways
[1:04:26] you can't move it how you want to move
[1:04:28] it you have to move it based on the
[1:04:30] rules of the game and the master chess
[1:04:33] players they distinguish themselves by
[1:04:36] how many moves ahead they can
[1:04:38] think so when you're playing a master
[1:04:41] chest player he will tell you Checkmate
[1:04:43] in four moves and if you are new to the
[1:04:46] game you can't even see it you can't
[1:04:48] even understand it but brother brandham
[1:04:50] said in that quote he said God let me
[1:04:52] read the quote exactly he said God has
[1:04:55] never Chang his strategy and he follows
[1:04:57] it with and Satan has never changed his
[1:05:01] when I read that this week it had me so
[1:05:03] happy because we are playing a fixed
[1:05:06] game where God's strategy is guaranteed
[1:05:09] to win and the devil can't even improve
[1:05:12] his game you understand what it is you
[1:05:15] may be seated for a minute I don't think
[1:05:17] you get me if you're playing chess
[1:05:20] brother kangali and you are trying to
[1:05:22] get better so you are practicing to
[1:05:24] improve so the next time you play
[1:05:26] against the player who is your opponent
[1:05:29] you want to be better than he is but we
[1:05:31] are playing a game where the enemy
[1:05:34] cannot get better the enemy cannot
[1:05:36] improve he cannot change his strategy
[1:05:40] and God also he cannot change his
[1:05:42] strategy because his strategy makes him
[1:05:45] a winner every single time he has never
[1:05:49] lost a battle he has never lost one
[1:05:52] there has been never one person that God
[1:05:54] predestinated ated that was ever lost
[1:05:58] because God can never change his
[1:06:01] strategy I can't hear you this
[1:06:04] morning you may be seated so if you are
[1:06:08] sick this morning you may be seated God
[1:06:11] allowed the man who was SI for 38 years
[1:06:14] to be sick for that time you may be
[1:06:17] seated for a minute I want you to get
[1:06:18] this because way back there in the
[1:06:21] beginning he told himself I want to
[1:06:23] deliver that one for myself I don't want
[1:06:26] a minister to pray for him I don't want
[1:06:28] the Elder to lay hands on him when I get
[1:06:30] there I'm going to take care of that
[1:06:33] lame man for 38 years he's coming to the
[1:06:36] pool looking for the angel to stir the
[1:06:39] waters but he doesn't know behind his
[1:06:42] struggle behind his situation behind his
[1:06:45] struggle God has a strategy and there
[1:06:48] came a day when Jesus walked by the pool
[1:06:52] of Bethesda he passed this one he passed
[1:06:55] that one he passed that one but he went
[1:06:58] straight for that man he said this one
[1:07:00] is mine will thou be made
[1:07:04] whole can the church say Amen you may be
[1:07:08] seated God could never change his
[1:07:12] strategy I already left my notes already
[1:07:15] God is limited brother the kangali until
[1:07:18] he gets somebody to use he needs some
[1:07:20] hands to use he needs some feet to use
[1:07:24] he needs somebody to look through he
[1:07:26] needs some mouth to speak so when Paul
[1:07:30] let's talk about Paul for a little bit
[1:07:32] Paul wasn't always Paul he was Saul but
[1:07:35] God's strategy is so good God picked
[1:07:38] Peter James John and all of these
[1:07:40] brothers they were uneducated they
[1:07:42] couldn't write they couldn't teach so
[1:07:45] God needed somebody to write the New
[1:07:47] Testament so he had to find an academic
[1:07:50] he had to find a writer so God in his
[1:07:52] strategy found a man called Saul in the
[1:07:56] eyes of the theologians he wasn't
[1:07:59] qualified he wasn't with Jesus but that
[1:08:02] was God's
[1:08:05] man you may be seated God could never
[1:08:09] change his strategy so what you where
[1:08:12] you were born is a part of his strategy
[1:08:15] where you work is a part of his strategy
[1:08:18] your condition is a part of his strategy
[1:08:20] because something is being
[1:08:23] unfolded Hallelujah you may be seated
[1:08:27] brother over preacher Masterpiece last
[1:08:29] week the breaking of Heaven's silence
[1:08:32] and while he was speaking dedicated me
[1:08:34] the strategy of Silence because silence
[1:08:37] itself is a strategy God loves to use
[1:08:40] silence to Veil what he's doing right
[1:08:43] now there might be silence over your
[1:08:44] life and nobody knows what's going on
[1:08:47] but there's a strategy God can never
[1:08:50] change his strategy so when it looks
[1:08:53] like you don't have the Holy Ghost and
[1:08:55] it looks like you're not going to make
[1:08:57] it that's God's strategy because he want
[1:08:59] to prove uh that he's the same yesterday
[1:09:02] he is the same today he is the same
[1:09:05] forever and the battle is not yours but
[1:09:08] it's the
[1:09:09] Lord's you may be seated you may be
[1:09:12] seated for a minute I love that when the
[1:09:16] battle is not yours that's no wonder you
[1:09:18] may be seated God could say I will
[1:09:21] restore sayth the Lord it has nothing to
[1:09:24] do with your effort
[1:09:25] nothing to do with your ability nothing
[1:09:28] to do with your prayers nothing to do
[1:09:30] with your action this is God saying I've
[1:09:32] watched the battle for a long time but
[1:09:35] now I'm stepping in because it's not
[1:09:37] your battle there was war In
[1:09:40] Heaven There was war in heaven and
[1:09:43] Michael fought and the dragon fought and
[1:09:46] that war dropped down here and we have
[1:09:48] been caught in a battle we have been
[1:09:50] caught in the crossfires but the battle
[1:09:53] is not ours it's the Lord
[1:09:55] [Applause]
[1:09:57] Hallelujah I feel religious I feel
[1:10:00] Pentecostal I feel Baptist Methodist
[1:10:03] everything mixed up in one because God
[1:10:05] Moved Through the Ages to bring it all
[1:10:07] to this spot when he will break the
[1:10:09] silence break the seals break the
[1:10:12] Mysteries and uncover who you are that
[1:10:15] you were born for such a time as this
[1:10:18] and can the devil stop it because the
[1:10:20] devil cannot change his
[1:10:23] strategy oh my you may be
[1:10:27] seated oh you don't hear me this morning
[1:10:30] Holy Ghost and Fire Daniel Holy Ghost
[1:10:33] and power listen you may be seated the
[1:10:36] devil thought he had Daniel when he was
[1:10:38] put in the Lion's Den it was the devil's
[1:10:41] strategy that Daniel ended up there but
[1:10:44] God's strategy that's why I read the
[1:10:46] scripture for my thoughts and not your
[1:10:49] thoughts neither are my ways like your
[1:10:52] ways for as the heaven is higher than
[1:10:54] the Earth so is my thoughts above your
[1:10:57] thoughts you could never figure out what
[1:11:00] God is doing but just trust God this
[1:11:03] morning that he has never changed his
[1:11:07] strategy he's still healing he's still
[1:11:10] fing he is still pouring out the Holy
[1:11:12] Ghost he's still saving the Sinners he
[1:11:15] can't stop
[1:11:18] it let me read something for you
[1:11:22] hallelujah hallelujah oh my Hallelujah
[1:11:24] God can change and that's a good thing
[1:11:28] he cannot change and that's a beautiful
[1:11:30] thing and the devil cannot change and
[1:11:33] that's a beautiful thing familiar
[1:11:35] scripture fixed match it's a fixed match
[1:11:38] hallelujah hallelujah if you have no
[1:11:41] money in your pocket don't worry God's
[1:11:43] strategy could never change when the
[1:11:45] disciples had no money to let them go
[1:11:47] fish and when they got the fish they had
[1:11:49] food and money cuz there was money in
[1:11:50] the fish how do you figure that out and
[1:11:53] God has never changed his strategy he
[1:11:56] said I've never seen a righteous
[1:11:58] forsaken nor his seed Bak bread God has
[1:12:01] never changed his strategy yeah a
[1:12:04] thousand fall on my right 10,000 I shall
[1:12:07] not be moved God has never changed his
[1:12:10] strategy some through the water some
[1:12:13] through the fire some through the flood
[1:12:15] but all through the blood God has never
[1:12:18] changed his strategy if you are all
[1:12:21] right today God didn't come for you
[1:12:23] because Jesus said the word of the Lord
[1:12:25] is upon me because he had anointed me to
[1:12:28] preach the gospel to the poor he had
[1:12:30] sent me to heal the brokenhearted to
[1:12:33] preach Deliverance to the captives and
[1:12:35] recovering of sight of the Blind and to
[1:12:38] set at Liberty them that are bruised to
[1:12:41] preach the acceptable year of the Lord
[1:12:44] and God has never changed his strategy
[1:12:48] so he's still here this morning to lift
[1:12:51] you up uh he's still here this morning
[1:12:53] to give you Deliverance uh he is still
[1:12:56] here this morning to break the chains
[1:12:58] upon your

[1:13:01] hallelujah
[1:13:03] hallelujah oh my my my my my
[1:13:08] my thank you this message is encourage
[1:13:11] you this morning because the devil
[1:13:13] listen the Bible say we are not ignorant
[1:13:14] of Satan's devices right that itself
[1:13:17] tells you a lot there's no device for
[1:13:19] the ger that the devil has that he could
[1:13:21] bring what that we are ignorant of all
[1:13:23] right it's the same things every time
[1:13:25] lust of the eye lust of the flesh pride
[1:13:27] of life he makes the ingredients
[1:13:29] different but the same
[1:13:31] thing we are not ignorant we know what
[1:13:34] he's trying to do we know he's trying to
[1:13:36] stop you but God is the greatest
[1:13:38] strategist that he ever ever ever ever
[1:13:41] is was will be he is the same yesterday
[1:13:43] today and forever Alpha and Omega and
[1:13:46] what I want to get to you because many
[1:13:47] people complain but the ROM preach the
[1:13:49] message why are people so tossed about
[1:13:52] anybody ever read that one amen he
[1:13:55] preached another one called letting off
[1:13:57] the
[1:13:58] pressure because life is meant to be a
[1:14:01] struggle and when I read the scriptures
[1:14:03] with the Kang I can't find a scripture
[1:14:05] to support this easy view of
[1:14:08] Christianity
[1:14:13] Amen
[1:14:17] Hallelujah
[1:14:21] Jesus
[1:14:23] Hallelujah my I want read something
[1:14:28] here in Hebrews
[1:14:32] 11 by faith the Hal rahad the Hal Rahab
[1:14:36] perish not with them that believe when
[1:14:38] she had received the spies with peace
[1:14:40] but what shall I more say for the time
[1:14:42] would Fe me to tell of Gideon and of
[1:14:44] Barack and of Samson and of jeffi of
[1:14:46] David also and Samuel and of the
[1:14:48] prophets who through faith subdued
[1:14:51] kingdoms wrought righteousness obtained
[1:14:53] promises Stu the mountain out of lions
[1:14:56] quenched the violence of fire escaped
[1:14:58] the edge of the sword out of weakness
[1:15:00] were made strong wax Valiant in fight
[1:15:03] turned to fly the armies of the
[1:15:07] aliens women received their dead race to
[1:15:10] life again and others were tortured not
[1:15:12] accepting Deliverance that they might
[1:15:14] obtain a better resurrection and others
[1:15:17] had trial of cure of cruel mockings and
[1:15:20] scourgings ye moreover of bongs and
[1:15:23] imprisonment they were stoned they were
[1:15:25] sown aunder were tempted were slain with
[1:15:28] the sword they wandered about in sheep
[1:15:30] skins and goat skins being destitute
[1:15:33] Afflicted tormented of whom the world
[1:15:35] was not worthy they wandered in deserts
[1:15:37] and in mountains and dens and caves of
[1:15:39] the earth and these all having attained
[1:15:42] a good report through faith receive not
[1:15:44] the promise God having provided some
[1:15:47] better thing for us that day without us
[1:15:49] should not be made perfect and as I was
[1:15:51] studying this and trying to get my heart
[1:15:54] and mind in line with what God wanted to
[1:15:55] say this morning I realize that the
[1:15:57] resume of these brothers is not the
[1:15:59] resume many of us want to
[1:16:02] have they were beaten they were scourged
[1:16:05] they were this happened and that
[1:16:06] happened and the moment we have one
[1:16:08] trial we want to give up when we have
[1:16:11] one trial we want to backslide when we
[1:16:13] have one situation we want to give but
[1:16:15] these considered it not to accept
[1:16:17] Deliverance that they might obtain a
[1:16:18] better Resurrection in other words the
[1:16:21] Revelation in their heart of who God was
[1:16:23] and who they were and the fath ha in
[1:16:25] their soul was so real to them that it
[1:16:28] didn't matter what the trial was it
[1:16:30] didn't matter what the testing was and I
[1:16:32] got good news for you God has never
[1:16:34] changed his strategy so there are no
[1:16:37] shortcuts amen there's no easy way no
[1:16:40] wonder the prophet say he could turn
[1:16:42] your wife against you he could turn the
[1:16:44] church against you there's no shortcut
[1:16:47] but God is going to have character out
[1:16:49] of somebody in such a time as this can
[1:16:52] the church say Amen oh oh blessed be the
[1:16:56] name of the Lord so in the message
[1:16:58] perfect strength by Perfect weakness but
[1:17:01] AB brandom said God's strategy is to
[1:17:03] take empty human vessels so God has a
[1:17:05] strategy is to take empty human vessels
[1:17:08] and shake the world with them like he
[1:17:11] did at Pentecost what did he do it taken
[1:17:13] them 10 days to get all emptied up but
[1:17:16] they were all standing there with their
[1:17:17] vessels turned up and God took himself
[1:17:20] and filled them up that's all and they
[1:17:23] shook the world God p pour himself into
[1:17:25] them and that's the same thing God wants
[1:17:27] to do this morning find some empty
[1:17:29] vessels that's his strategy individual
[1:17:33] that he could use individuals that he
[1:17:35] could fill can the church say
[1:17:40] amen
[1:17:42] hallelujah so I want to talk a bit about
[1:17:44] God's strategy there are so many of them
[1:17:47] we can't get to them all this morning
[1:17:49] but I want to talk about the strategy of
[1:17:51] solitude because many of us we want to
[1:17:53] be in a group and part of something and
[1:17:55] we realize that God's strategy is to
[1:17:57] call
[1:17:59] individuals and for God to call you as
[1:18:01] an individual you can be with everybody
[1:18:03] else so God has a strategy of solitude I
[1:18:06] call
[1:18:08] it when Jacob was ready to reach a
[1:18:12] certain Junction of his time after he
[1:18:14] was blessed and he was with his family
[1:18:15] God forced the issue that he had to
[1:18:17] leave where he was to go back to his
[1:18:19] land because he was not in his land and
[1:18:20] as he's going back he hears word that
[1:18:23] his brother Esau who looked at him funny
[1:18:26] who thought he was a no good Rascal was
[1:18:28] on his way to find him so Jacob cut his
[1:18:31] risk and divided his family and divided
[1:18:33] the people he send this one this way
[1:18:35] send his wife this way and the Bible
[1:18:37] said Jacob was left alone and it might
[1:18:40] seem sometimes when you end up by
[1:18:41] yourself you want to ask the question
[1:18:43] where is God and why did this happen to
[1:18:45] me but that was God's strategy because
[1:18:47] what God wanted to do something for
[1:18:49] Jacob and he couldn't do it when he was
[1:18:51] with everybody else he couldn't do it
[1:18:53] when he was with his friends he couldn't
[1:18:55] even do it when he was with his wife
[1:18:56] because he had to send his wife away he
[1:18:58] sent his children away he sent his
[1:19:00] wealth away and the Bible said Jacob was
[1:19:03] left alone and when you are left alone
[1:19:06] in your prayer closet when you were left
[1:19:07] alone in your trial and you could no
[1:19:10] longer talk to anybody else that's the
[1:19:12] best time that God could speak to you so
[1:19:15] if you are in alone time right now and
[1:19:18] nobody seems to understand and there's
[1:19:20] nobody to talk to get courage this
[1:19:23] morning because God has never changed
[1:19:26] his strategy he God will do whatever he
[1:19:29] has to do to bring you to the spot where
[1:19:31] he could get the Holy Ghost on the
[1:19:33] inside of you somebody say
[1:19:38] amen God is not speaking to the group he
[1:19:41] speaking to individuals so you may be
[1:19:43] seated so if you can call yourself aside
[1:19:46] if you can pull yourself aside if you
[1:19:49] can separate from your connections and
[1:19:52] from the worldly associations God has wa
[1:19:55] to turn the pressure on to increase the
[1:19:58] stress in your life to force you to come
[1:20:01] alone because when you're by yourself
[1:20:04] the same thing with John on the aisle of
[1:20:05] pmos Peter wasn't there and James wasn't
[1:20:08] there but when John was alone he heard a
[1:20:11] voice say come up here I've been waiting
[1:20:13] a long time to talk to you but I waited
[1:20:16] till nobody else was around that's God's
[1:20:18] strategy so there are some people here
[1:20:20] this morning God is bringing you to a
[1:20:22] spot to pull you like Moses by the
[1:20:25] pillar of fire his wife wasn't there in
[1:20:28] that encounter come on
[1:20:31] Church Oh My My My and God has never
[1:20:36] changed his strategy you may be seated
[1:20:38] God is not filling a group he is filling
[1:20:41] individuals uh he's not baptizing a
[1:20:43] group he's baptizing individuals uh he's
[1:20:46] not calling a group he's calling
[1:20:50] individuals can the church say amen and
[1:20:53] God has never change his strategy you
[1:20:56] read the scripture it's first name
[1:20:58] basis individuals Abraham Isaac Jacob
[1:21:04] David Joshua
[1:21:07] Joseph are you hearing me this morning
[1:21:10] Caleb Elijah first name basis I want God
[1:21:14] to say Isaac not talking about that one
[1:21:16] but talking about me first name basis
[1:21:19] individual Anthony who's he talking
[1:21:21] about papwell yeah that's right
[1:21:23] individual but to be called out like
[1:21:26] that you got to be to stand alone you
[1:21:28] may be seated I told them in maraval
[1:21:31] there are some people if they don't get
[1:21:33] one service they
[1:21:35] backslid because they can't stand on
[1:21:37] their own right but God wants you to
[1:21:39] stand anywhere but the brandom said John
[1:21:42] was in the is of pmos he was by himself
[1:21:45] but he was in the spirit on the Lord's
[1:21:46] day he didn't need a song leader to say
[1:21:49] let's get ready he didn't need to say
[1:21:50] somebody let's go to church no he was
[1:21:52] there in prison and he was still in the
[1:21:55] spirit Peter was in prison still in the
[1:21:58] spirit Paul was in prison still in the
[1:22:03] spirit can the church say Amen everybody
[1:22:06] with me this morning we're going
[1:22:08] somewhere this morning God has never
[1:22:10] changed his
[1:22:12] strategy
[1:22:16] Hallelujah God has another strategy I
[1:22:19] call it the secret agent
[1:22:21] strategy God knew that the children of
[1:22:24] Israel would be be without food right
[1:22:26] because God is thinking so far ahead he
[1:22:28] know that in order to get the children
[1:22:30] of Israel to pass through Egypt to break
[1:22:32] Egypt and to take him to the promised
[1:22:34] land he would have to in order to get
[1:22:36] the children of Israel into Egypt it had
[1:22:37] to be a famine and all of this God
[1:22:39] already worked
[1:22:41] out but in order for the famine to come
[1:22:44] and for the children of Israel to have
[1:22:45] food you have to have a right man in the
[1:22:47] right place amen so Joseph is growing up
[1:22:50] now all right he doesn't know what he's
[1:22:52] born to do he has no clue what his
[1:22:54] purpose all he knows he has these
[1:22:56] profound dreams and when if he tell
[1:22:58] these dreams the brothers around him get
[1:23:00] little bothered about him because this
[1:23:01] boy a little too spiritual he always
[1:23:03] seemed to be worshiping they could find
[1:23:05] no fault with Joseph the Kang and he's
[1:23:07] saying I had this dream and this one
[1:23:09] bowed down
[1:23:11] and and his father loved him gave him a
[1:23:14] coat but his brothers took him his own
[1:23:16] Brothers it wasn't the enemy it wasn't
[1:23:18] his neighbors his own brothers who he
[1:23:20] grew up with he play Pitch with them he
[1:23:22] played Nintendo with them he play play
[1:23:24] with them he thought they were cool his
[1:23:26] same Brothers he grew up and throw him
[1:23:28] into the pit am amen amen so don't feel
[1:23:31] bad if your brother throw you in hallah
[1:23:34] don't feel bad if somebody you didn't
[1:23:35] expect to you something they didn't even
[1:23:38] know that they were doing something in
[1:23:40] God's strategy and there Joseph he's in
[1:23:43] the pit he wasn't excited he wasn't
[1:23:46] happy he's feeling sorry for himself he
[1:23:48] say I didn't do this it wasn't my fault
[1:23:50] I was just worshiping I was I didn't
[1:23:52] give myself the dream the dream came to
[1:23:54] me and here I am no coat locked up and
[1:23:58] then they sold him into slavery he ends
[1:24:00] up in Egypt he didn't plan to be there
[1:24:03] he ends up poy for wife make a move you
[1:24:05] run for his life still get in
[1:24:09] trouble Joseph not making any mistakes
[1:24:11] here now but this is God's strategy
[1:24:14] Joseph in prison he's being tested he's
[1:24:17] being tried because there's a throne
[1:24:19] waiting for him that he doesn't even
[1:24:21] know about and while in prison he can't
[1:24:24] even get out of spirit dreams are coming
[1:24:27] and he's still interpreting the dreams
[1:24:29] he is still anointed in the midst of his
[1:24:33] [Applause]
[1:24:35] trial so brother Isaac this morning I'm
[1:24:37] in a trial I'm in a test I'm in
[1:24:41] prison keep worshiping keep praising the
[1:24:45] battle is not yours it's not about you
[1:24:48] the battle is not yours it's the Lord's
[1:24:51] God God is seeing Joseph's brothers the
[1:24:54] see ones who sold them out he's seeing
[1:24:55] his cousins his nephews the whole family
[1:24:58] and Joseph is there you may be seated he
[1:25:01] tells them when you get back into Power
[1:25:03] remember me and God's strategy he wipes
[1:25:05] the memory of the butler don't remember
[1:25:08] him
[1:25:09] yet not time
[1:25:12] yet amen amen until the king reaches a
[1:25:15] crossroad he has a dream and the wise
[1:25:17] men can interpret it the ministers can
[1:25:19] interpret it the Bishops can and the
[1:25:21] butl there but wait a minute wait a
[1:25:23] minute there's somebody in
[1:25:25] prison his name is Joseph he says send
[1:25:27] for Joseph and when Joseph time come he
[1:25:31] didn't even know what he was walking
[1:25:32] into he didn't know what to expect they
[1:25:34] shaved his Beed and they get Joseph
[1:25:37] ready and Joseph didn't even know not
[1:25:39] many days hence he was going to be on
[1:25:41] the right hand of
[1:25:44] pharaoh can the church whether they like
[1:25:47] it or don't like it it didn't change the
[1:25:49] fact that God was positionally placing
[1:25:52] him to be there to deliver his
[1:25:55] family Hallelujah stop looking at your
[1:25:58] trial stop looking at your situation God
[1:26:01] wants to use you to deliver your family
[1:26:03] to deliver your loved ones it's not
[1:26:05] about you the battle is not yours it is
[1:26:09] the Lord's cander church say
[1:26:11] [Applause]
[1:26:15] amen

[1:26:20] yourself the question why me Hallelujah

[1:26:28] other person looking you don't even know
[1:26:29] what trial they're going through but
[1:26:31] they look like they on a shouting every
[1:26:34] time you see them they shouting you
[1:26:35] don't even know every time they shout is
[1:26:36] their way of getting air because they
[1:26:37] under so much of a different kind of
[1:26:41] pressure and you think you are under so
[1:26:43] much trial and God is
[1:26:45] saying like there's a there's a there's
[1:26:47] a image that goes around with somebody
[1:26:49] saying God but Lord you're hitting me
[1:26:51] with this like a stone or whatever this
[1:26:54] is the rock or the whatever that's
[1:26:55] coming against me say Lord why it's so
[1:26:56] big and then you see the other scene is
[1:26:58] like God holding back some bigger rocks
[1:27:00] he said like the smallest one that one
[1:27:01] just slipped
[1:27:02] through and you think your trial is the
[1:27:05] biggest trial and God is making sure
[1:27:07] that you can get more than you could
[1:27:12] bear and whatever he allows your way he
[1:27:15] knows your shoulders could handle it

[1:31:47] before the Lord worshiping the Lord and
[1:31:49] the Levites of the children of the Kites
[1:31:52] and the children stood up to praise the
[1:31:54] Lord God of Israel with a loud voice on
[1:31:57] high and they Rose early in the morning
[1:31:59] and went forth Into the Wilderness and
[1:32:02] as they went forth Jehoshaphat said

[1:32:19] people he appointed singers unto the
[1:32:21] Lord and that should praise the beauty
[1:32:24] of Holiness as they went out before the
[1:32:27] Army to say praise the Lord for his
[1:32:30] mercy endureth forever and listen and

[1:33:49] because the rejoicing of the Lord is in
[1:33:52] the Tabernacles of the righteous
[1:33:54] I shall not die but live to declare the
[1:33:57] works of the
[1:33:59] Lord this is the day that the Lord hath
[1:34:02] made no trial no weapon no
[1:34:07] demon formed against you could ever
[1:34:10] Prosper because it's not your battle the
[1:34:13] Lord is powerful he is mighty in battle
[1:34:16] he is my shield he is my buckler he is
[1:34:19] my defense he is my strong tower he is
[1:34:23] my Fortress
[1:34:24] he is my great
[1:34:25] deliverer and he has never lost a battle
[1:34:28] yet and God can never change his
[1:34:32] strategy Give the Lord a shout of
[1:34:35] [Applause]
[1:34:50] Praise You may be seated hallelujah
[1:34:53] hallelujah
[1:34:55] Hallelujah everybody feeling fine we now
[1:34:58] know why we come to church right to get
[1:35:01] encouragement for us to be worshippers
[1:35:04] because God means object of worship how
[1:35:06] could you come to church without worship
[1:35:08] how could you come here without praise
[1:35:10] yes you have problems that's understood
[1:35:11] you have trials you have un understood
[1:35:13] you have needs that understood but that
[1:35:15] doesn't change the fact that he's worthy
[1:35:17] of worship he's worthy of Praise My
[1:35:19] problem is bigger than your problem
[1:35:21] we're not debating that right now we
[1:35:23] leave that for later on but right now
[1:35:25] we're dealing with the fact that he is
[1:35:26] worthy he is worthy he is worthy of the
[1:35:29] praise he is Alpha and Omega he is
[1:35:32] beginning and the end he is the first
[1:35:34] and the last the rose of shon the lily
[1:35:37] of the valley the Bright Morning
[1:35:42] Star he is worthy he is worthy once the
[1:35:46] Praises go up the glory comes down uh
[1:35:49] you could be here worshiping and the
[1:35:51] glory descends in your home you could be
[1:35:53] here worshiping and the glory descends
[1:35:55] on your job when you walk into to work
[1:35:57] tomorrow it's a different place because
[1:35:59] God is obligated to send ambushments
[1:36:02] once the worship goes he can't help
[1:36:05] himself the
[1:36:12] ambushments you may be seated I don't
[1:36:15] think people really understand that God
[1:36:18] is Tied by his own law all right all
[1:36:21] right all right Hallelujah
[1:36:24] my Jesus his movements are restricted by
[1:36:26] his word because his word is
[1:36:29] absolute so when the Centurion Roman
[1:36:32] came to Jesus and said I'm not worthy
[1:36:34] right for you to come under my roof just
[1:36:37] speak the word Jesus he he said I
[1:36:39] haven't seen Faith like this but when
[1:36:41] you touch faith and you speak to me in
[1:36:43] that language I have no choice but to
[1:36:48] respond doesn't matter if you in church
[1:36:51] out of church backsliding Ro on Jewish
[1:36:54] when you speak to me in that language I
[1:36:56] have no choice but to answer he said I
[1:36:59] haven't seen Faith like this go thy way
[1:37:02] your servant is healed I can't even pull
[1:37:05] it back you touch the right buttons you
[1:37:08] dial the right number and you have to
[1:37:11] get the right
[1:37:15] response you may be seated so the woman
[1:37:18] with the issue of blood there was no
[1:37:21] precedent for her she did not read about
[1:37:24] this she didn't study this somewhere but
[1:37:27] she told herself she tapped into a law
[1:37:30] she didn't even realize if you shall say
[1:37:32] to this mountain be moved and don't
[1:37:34] doubt it your heart so she told herself
[1:37:37] without even reading the scripture if I
[1:37:39] could just Touch the Hem of His Garment
[1:37:42] within her heart she already made a
[1:37:44] withdrawal of healing so when she got to
[1:37:46] Jesus and she touched Jesus all of a
[1:37:49] sudden Jesus felt the bank account level
[1:37:51] drop
[1:37:53] he said who touched me I felt somebody
[1:37:56] made a withdrawal I felt virtue left me
[1:38:00] Peter without Revelation said but
[1:38:02] everybody touching you he said no this
[1:38:04] is different I couldn't even help myself
[1:38:07] it happened without me even realizing
[1:38:10] that somebody was in the ATM about to do
[1:38:12] a transaction so when the money came on
[1:38:15] the cash register I was like who who
[1:38:18] made the
[1:38:20] [Applause]
[1:38:21] withdrawal you don't hear me this
[1:38:23] morning morning you don't hear me this
[1:38:25] morning you can make a withdrawal this
[1:38:27] morning you can make a withdrawal this
[1:38:30] morning you could touch Jesus this
[1:38:32] morning tell him what you want reach out
[1:38:35] this morning God has never changed his
[1:38:38] strategy he's going to release power
[1:38:41] he's going to release the Holy
[1:38:44] Ghost listen to what the prophet said he
[1:38:48] said amen hallu
[1:38:53] brother brother B said if he healed a
[1:38:55] man at any time through the Journey of
[1:38:58] life let it be in the days of Jesus the
[1:39:01] apostles the prophets whenever it was
[1:39:04] when the same conditions is met he's got
[1:39:07] to do it again that's right he doesn't
[1:39:09] change man changes time changes age
[1:39:13] changes dispensation changes but God
[1:39:17] Remains the Same he is perfect what a
[1:39:20] hope that ought to give the sick people
[1:39:22] amen
[1:39:24] if he ever healed a person he has to do
[1:39:26] it again when the same condition is met
[1:39:29] and I believe this morning God is
[1:39:32] healing sick people in here this morning
[1:39:34] I'm not saying he will do it he is doing
[1:39:37] it because he cannot change his
[1:39:41] strategy
[1:39:44] Hallelujah brother BR said he ever saved
[1:39:46] a man he's got to do it the same grounds
[1:39:49] he did it the first time if he ever
[1:39:51] filled a man with the Holy Ghost he's
[1:39:53] got to do it on the same grounds he did
[1:39:56] the first time if he ever raised a man
[1:39:58] up from the grave he's got to do it the
[1:40:01] second time and every other time on the
[1:40:04] same principle he doesn't change oh what
[1:40:07] a hope that gives me what is it not in
[1:40:10] some man-made fairy some of that groups
[1:40:12] of man have come together but his
[1:40:15] unchangeable word can the Church Say
[1:40:22] Amen everybody feeling fine I'm all over
[1:40:25] the place this morning strategy yes so
[1:40:30] when you study this you realize that you
[1:40:32] could find yourself in
[1:40:36] scripture hallu
[1:40:38] hallu you know you are in scripture if
[1:40:41] you're not in scripture then you
[1:40:43] knowwhere Hallelujah but not just in
[1:40:45] scripture as in we
[1:40:48] use the people that know their God shall
[1:40:50] do exploits and that speaks about you
[1:40:51] that's true but the Bible is it's a
[1:40:54] powerful book because within there you
[1:40:56] have to see your life and your
[1:40:59] situation be it in prison like Joseph
[1:41:02] amen not understanding what you're going
[1:41:05] through Hallelujah being like Samson
[1:41:08] call for a specific purpose Jesus but
[1:41:11] losing the
[1:41:12] burden losing the vision Samson was so
[1:41:16] confident in his ability he lost the
[1:41:19] confidence and the burden and the plan
[1:41:22] and just relied on his ability
[1:41:24] hallelujah amen and God allowed Samson
[1:41:29] to be caught all right because in God's
[1:41:31] mind he saw the all of the Philistines
[1:41:35] and the Lords of the Philistines being
[1:41:37] destroyed I want you to picture for a
[1:41:39] minute the Bible said that there were
[1:41:40] 3,000
[1:41:42] amen caught up there brother kangi when
[1:41:44] Samson was brought to to make
[1:41:48] sportall I wonder what would have
[1:41:50] happened if Samson was not a prisoner
[1:41:53] and Samson was still in his strength and
[1:41:56] still in the way they knew him years
[1:41:57] before if he had walked into that same
[1:41:59] building on that day you know what would
[1:42:01] have happened they would have all ran
[1:42:03] out of that building so fast Amen
[1:42:06] brother they would have pulled all the
[1:42:08] fastest Chariot and Caravans because it
[1:42:11] was concentration risk for all the Lords
[1:42:13] to be in one
[1:42:15] place but God foresaw all of this and he
[1:42:17] say you know what to take out all of the
[1:42:20] laws of the Philistines in one shot
[1:42:23] I need to take a man through certain
[1:42:25] trials certain testings Behind Enemy
[1:42:29] Lines take out his eyes listen so Samson
[1:42:33] is there he knows the glory he knows the
[1:42:37] power he's the only man to lift up Gates
[1:42:40] Hallelujah open the lion's mouth he's
[1:42:43] the only man to pick up a Jawbone and
[1:42:45] Hallelujah when he looked at the jawb
[1:42:47] and looked at the enemy they didn't know
[1:42:49] what was going to happen next but when
[1:42:50] he start to fight they say this is not
[1:42:51] what we expected
[1:42:54] this was this man called
[1:42:56] Samson but after it all brother kangali
[1:42:59] Samson started off good like many
[1:43:00] Christians do amen Amen on fire anointed
[1:43:03] inspired but lust of the eyes lust of
[1:43:06] the flesh pride of
[1:43:07] life the devil sent a woman Hallelujah
[1:43:11] to wrap him
[1:43:12] up and it was it first it was inocent
[1:43:15] know if you time a here inside call them
[1:43:19] Samson pH but he was having fun yes
[1:43:22] until it was no more fun that's good
[1:43:25] that's good right no more fun because it
[1:43:27] wasn't all that once this lady didn't
[1:43:28] come and tell Samson Samson I want to
[1:43:30] cut off your hair so that you could
[1:43:31] become a prison of the Phil if you said
[1:43:32] he was going to run that's
[1:43:34] right but it was subtle like many of us
[1:43:37] allow subtle things into our lives amen
[1:43:40] and it comes in all easy all innocent
[1:43:42] just
[1:43:44] friends just friends are you a Christian
[1:43:47] no that's good I have a lot of Christian
[1:43:49] friends systematic destruction of your
[1:43:51] defenses yes yes yes and Samson found
[1:43:55] himself in a position going back and
[1:43:56] forth back and forth until his hair got
[1:43:59] cut
[1:44:01] off but I want to say something this
[1:44:03] morning don't write
[1:44:04] off
[1:44:11] anybody don't write off anybody Samson
[1:44:14] is there in
[1:44:16] prison and the Philistines write him off
[1:44:19] yes the devil wrote him off even
[1:44:21] Believers or enough yes was an
[1:44:24] evangelist they take his tapes out the
[1:44:26] church nobody talking about Samson
[1:44:28] anymore all they hear Samson
[1:44:31] backslide yes Samson the one who putting
[1:44:34] the gate and thing yes Sams some woman
[1:44:36] tie up Samson Samson there in the
[1:44:39] prison Samson written off you
[1:44:43] know nobody go and check Samson in
[1:44:46] prison but while Samson is in there
[1:44:49] God's
[1:44:51] strategy you know it takes Years brother
[1:44:53] Karen to put a spy Behind Enemy Lines
[1:44:57] somebody takes 30 years for the man to
[1:44:59] work himself up the ranks in a foreign
[1:45:01] government years born there he was he
[1:45:05] went there with he a child and he fit in
[1:45:06] his family and stuff and his years and
[1:45:08] years and they get you're not activated
[1:45:10] until you get the code to get activated
[1:45:12] for whatever government you for now
[1:45:14] you're in place you've been there for 20
[1:45:15] years this is when you go and hit the
[1:45:17] nuclear
[1:45:18] war and it take years so God now has
[1:45:20] this strategy Behind Enemy lines and
[1:45:23] Samson is finally in place grinding at
[1:45:26] the Mill and he still don't know what
[1:45:27] his mission
[1:45:28] is and he feeling sorry for himself like
[1:45:30] many of us we saying I remember when I
[1:45:32] was in the fire I remember back in 83
[1:45:34] when the Holy Ghost part and we ran
[1:45:36] around the building I remember 93 I
[1:45:38] remember 200 I remember the convention I
[1:45:40] remember pen Harris I remember all these
[1:45:42] revivals and you're grinding at the Mill
[1:45:44] you don't know how you end up here you
[1:45:45] remember when you were Usher when you
[1:45:46] were Deacon when you on fire when your
[1:45:48] wife was with you when your husband was
[1:45:50] you only was in church
[1:45:54] and you're grinding at the
[1:45:55] Mill your hair has been cut off your
[1:45:58] eyes have been blinded God took away
[1:46:01] your natural eyesight so that now all of
[1:46:03] a sudden you have a spiritual eyes and
[1:46:05] then something begins to open up to you
[1:46:07] and then you feel one day you come to a
[1:46:09] service like just any other day and they
[1:46:10] say Samson come and we want to carry
[1:46:12] outside and Samson D to make
[1:46:16] sport because the enemy never thought
[1:46:19] Samson was going to be anything anyway
[1:46:22] the whole concept of making sport is
[1:46:24] when you finally catch somebody and you
[1:46:26] feel you have them and Samson is there
[1:46:29] and his last breath he said leave me to
[1:46:31] the pillars and but the Bram said Samson
[1:46:33] saw a
[1:46:36] possibility he saw something and while
[1:46:39] Samson was there all of a sudden he
[1:46:42] began to pray once more Lord and then
[1:46:45] all of God's strategy just
[1:46:48] snapped God had finally had a man in
[1:46:51] place to finish the Philistines with a
[1:46:54] popwell all the trials all the testings
[1:46:57] when it looked like God was not there
[1:46:59] God was doing something with his life
[1:47:02] under silence when they wrote him off
[1:47:04] God was doing something with him and he
[1:47:07] began to hold onto the pillars he began
[1:47:09] to shake the pillars he say once more
[1:47:12] Lord what the devil didn't realize is
[1:47:14] that Samson here was growing
[1:47:17] back under silence nothing looked like
[1:47:20] it was happening but under silence
[1:47:23] throughout the trial throughout the
[1:47:25] mistake throughout the backsliding
[1:47:27] moment his hair was growing out because
[1:47:30] God's purpose will always be
[1:47:32] accomplished and God has never lost one
[1:47:35] [Music]
[1:47:36] [Applause]
[1:47:39] yet you may be
[1:47:42] seated oh
[1:47:44] Hallelujah God's strategy will never be
[1:47:47] defeated so don't write off anybody you
[1:47:50] keep praying for people don't talk about
[1:47:52] people yes see what he doing now what's
[1:47:55] she doing now what good no no no no no
[1:47:56] no no no no that's not your place just
[1:47:59] pray Lord let your will be done Lord
[1:48:01] keep me keep them keep us until that day
[1:48:04] but Lord we worship you we praise you
[1:48:06] that's your attitude because you don't
[1:48:08] know what secret mission God has
[1:48:10] everybody on you don't hear me this
[1:48:11] morning you don't know what secret
[1:48:13] mission God has you and your family on
[1:48:16] for his honor and for his glory Samson
[1:48:18] killed more in his death than in his
[1:48:20] life and you know what for all of Sam
[1:48:22] backside him he's going to be over there
[1:48:25] I'm looking to shake his
[1:48:27] hand oh you don't hear me this morning
[1:48:30] we preached it before no matter David's
[1:48:33] mistakes he was still a man after God's
[1:48:35] Own Heart God wiped his record clean God
[1:48:38] loves to ripe your record
[1:48:41] [Applause]
[1:48:42] [Music]
[1:48:44] clean you may be seated God hallelujah
[1:48:49] God's strategy hallu we still under the
[1:48:51] secret agent strategy
[1:48:53] could you take some more I have 992
[1:48:56] strategies Jesus just
[1:49:09] kidding we talked about the soul to
[1:49:13] Paul at the beginning amen how God had
[1:49:16] to find somebody who could write Peter
[1:49:19] was not that man right he had to find
[1:49:21] somebody to write the bul of the New
[1:49:22] Testament
[1:49:23] so Saul was the academic training the
[1:49:26] right place the right experience he had
[1:49:28] the wrong
[1:49:30] Doctrine but he was the right
[1:49:33] man Saul thought he was doing the right
[1:49:35] thing understand this H you could be
[1:49:37] totally convinced that you're right and
[1:49:39] still be wrong so Saul is there when
[1:49:41] Steven is killed he's like that's him
[1:49:43] that's Steven the Deacon from the church
[1:49:45] that's him that's the one to kill right
[1:49:47] so I want you to understand the Paradox
[1:49:49] of how God
[1:49:50] works when SA becomes Paul and turns up
[1:49:54] in church you know the Bible said the
[1:49:55] Believers had they struggle to accept
[1:49:58] him and that's a lesson for us you know
[1:50:00] because God will deliver some people and
[1:50:02] I know some of you will
[1:50:08] [Applause]
[1:50:11] struggle on now we in the word now the
[1:50:15] Bible said the Believers struggled it
[1:50:17] was turn around greet your brother andow
[1:50:23] you imagine how Paul felt and he was the
[1:50:25] messenger to the first church age and
[1:50:28] the Believers in the church who walked
[1:50:31] with Jesus talked with Jesus had issues
[1:50:34] with This Man Called Paul yes until Paul
[1:50:38] actually had to just keep growing in
[1:50:40] Grace and Ministry until he reached the
[1:50:42] point that he could straighten Peter out
[1:50:43] and say Peter you can't come down and
[1:50:45] tell the Gentiles stuff from
[1:50:49] Jerusalem I was not with Jesus but the
[1:50:51] same Jesus that met with you met with
[1:50:56] me my approval is not from the brothers
[1:50:59] in Jerusalem my Ministry is not to
[1:51:03] Jerusalem my gift is not to Jerusalem
[1:51:06] but Paul the Apostle to the
[1:51:08] [Music]
[1:51:09] Gent my March and orders are not from
[1:51:12] Jerusalem don't put me under Jerusalem
[1:51:15] Doctrine my instructions come from a God
[1:51:18] and if any Angel preach anything other
[1:51:20] than what I'm saying let him be a curse
[1:51:23] let this be the
[1:51:24] [Music]
[1:51:27] absolute you may be seated you
[1:51:31] understand the
[1:51:32] sovereignity of God that he could take
[1:51:35] somebody who was responsible for killing
[1:51:37] deacons Hallelujah and using them as the
[1:51:40] Apostle The Benchmark that brother
[1:51:42] brandham at the seven Church eight could
[1:51:44] say I preach what Paul
[1:51:46] preached and that Paul was the gold
[1:51:49] standard the standard by which every
[1:51:51] single messenger has to be measured This
[1:51:54] Man Called Paul and you want to tell me
[1:51:56] your past God can't turn it around and
[1:51:59] God can't use you and you're not going
[1:52:01] to make it and your mistakes is too
[1:52:04] much God could use anybody and God has
[1:52:07] never change his strategy God loves to
[1:52:11] take the unexpected people and fill them
[1:52:13] with the Holy Ghost and give them power
[1:52:16] and give them Grace and give them an
[1:52:18] anointing give them a Ministry
[1:52:21] [Applause]
[1:52:23] you may be
[1:52:25] seated and it will speak for
[1:52:29] itself always way does it will speak for
[1:52:31] itself can the church say
[1:52:33] Amen you love the word some growing up
[1:52:37] to the way so God you know that's why
[1:52:38] brother brand said God will send things
[1:52:41] into the
[1:52:42] church that's a strategy to try the
[1:52:45] church so when God sent Paul into the
[1:52:48] church he was trying the church you need
[1:52:49] more love amen amen he need more grace
[1:52:53] you need more forgiveness don't hold
[1:52:55] Arts don't hold grudges how will God
[1:52:58] know if you have the tendency to hold
[1:53:00] grudges unless he send somebody that you
[1:53:02] could be
[1:53:08] grudging you could only be proven if
[1:53:10] there's a
[1:53:11] test let me say that again what's in you
[1:53:14] could only be proven when there's a test
[1:53:18] right so if God want to test your
[1:53:20] ability to forgive you has to send a
[1:53:21] situation where it's going to take
[1:53:23] everything in you to
[1:53:28] forgive because he wants to prove that
[1:53:30] you have the
[1:53:32] character amen and God has a
[1:53:35] responsibility to test because you
[1:53:36] cannot graduate without passing a
[1:53:40] test Jesus himself had to be tested and
[1:53:43] you don't want a test his whole
[1:53:45] Wilderness experience was a test that's
[1:53:47] right amen and Jesus passed the test
[1:53:49] overcame lust of the eye overcame lust
[1:53:52] of the flesh overcame pride of life
[1:53:53] check check check a a a pass pass on M
[1:53:57] Transfiguration adoption hallah and you
[1:54:00] want to pass the class no Wilderness but
[1:54:05] it says all the time many of us are
[1:54:06] being Tri and is not yet sent to the
[1:54:07] Wilderness you will know when it's sent
[1:54:09] to the Wilderness your child just become
[1:54:11] really
[1:54:14] different but when you're ready for
[1:54:15] Wilderness know that power is on the
[1:54:17] other end returning in the power of the
[1:54:21] spirit because the test is to make sure
[1:54:23] that when God give you power and Paul
[1:54:26] walks in the church and say that was
[1:54:27] Paul was Steven bind
[1:54:31] him because right now that your instinct
[1:54:33] you
[1:54:35] know and you have to let God deal with
[1:54:39] individuals God deal with people's lives
[1:54:42] because you don't know listen carefully
[1:54:44] what mission God has them on because
[1:54:47] everybody is on a mission because
[1:54:48] everybody has a purpose and they all
[1:54:50] pieces on God's chest board canand the
[1:54:52] church say Amen could you take some
[1:54:55] more so I just going to touch on two
[1:54:57] more then close out with the strategy of
[1:54:59] silence and connect to brother ob's
[1:55:01] message last week the breaking of Heaven
[1:55:04] silence so God loves to make it look
[1:55:06] like you're
[1:55:07] finished Daniel the Hebrew boys they all
[1:55:10] thought they were finished the devil
[1:55:11] thought they were finished he closed the
[1:55:12] book and say they're
[1:55:13] done and then Daniel comes out the next
[1:55:15] day and the Hebrew boys there's a for
[1:55:17] man in the fire they say where did that
[1:55:18] man come from we didn't put him
[1:55:20] there God's strategy and he never
[1:55:22] changes his strategy he chooses unlikely
[1:55:25] people the woman at the well Rahab The
[1:55:27] Prostitute so don't count yourselves off
[1:55:30] friends I want to speak about the
[1:55:32] strategy of silence and I'll begin to
[1:55:34] close out silence Abraham touch it last
[1:55:37] week for 25 years he was under
[1:55:41] silence and the Bible did not say that
[1:55:44] Abraham staggered
[1:55:50] not it said he staggered not at the
[1:55:54] promise of
[1:55:57] God so it doesn't mean that Abraham
[1:55:59] didn't have up days and down days but
[1:56:01] when it came to the promise of God there
[1:56:02] was no
[1:56:04] compromise and that's how we must be
[1:56:06] with the trials that come our way Glory
[1:56:10] you will have updates you will have down
[1:56:11] days you'll have days it seems all
[1:56:13] confusing and all messed up but don't
[1:56:14] stagger at the promise of God because
[1:56:17] that is what will keep you alive that is
[1:56:19] what will keep you through the trial
[1:56:25] it is not realistic to tell you you will
[1:56:27] never stagger that's not real there will
[1:56:30] be up days there will be down days there
[1:56:32] will be days you wonder I wonder if
[1:56:34] you're going to make it but don't
[1:56:35] stagger at the promise of God Amen but
[1:56:39] in that thing be strong and give praise
[1:56:42] Hallelujah that you're going to be
[1:56:43] healed Hall that the promise say you're
[1:56:45] going to get the Holy Ghost that the
[1:56:47] promise says we're going to have a
[1:56:48] Revival that the promise says one of
[1:56:50] these days your body is going to be
[1:56:51] changed don't stagger at
[1:56:54] that if you stagger with your job that's
[1:56:57] all right but don't stagger at the
[1:56:59] promise of God if you make mistakes in
[1:57:01] your home that's all right but don't
[1:57:03] stagger at the promise of
[1:57:06] God can the church say
[1:57:09] Amen everybody feeling fine so I want to
[1:57:12] connect now to about always message last
[1:57:14] week the breaking of Heaven silence and
[1:57:17] he read the scripture about silence in
[1:57:19] heaven for the space of half an hour
[1:57:23] and I preached on this sometime last
[1:57:25] year about how every good director knows
[1:57:27] how to use Sound and Music and silence
[1:57:30] to create the right effect because if
[1:57:33] you playing and you're conducting a
[1:57:34] choir there are times you want to stop
[1:57:37] to create a pause so when the music
[1:57:39] resumes it creates a certain Symphony a
[1:57:41] certain Harmony a certain Melody and on
[1:57:44] the seven day the Bible says there was
[1:57:46] silence in heaven for the space of half
[1:57:48] hour so God brought an interlude a pause
[1:57:51] a space of silence and if you go back
[1:57:53] through the Old Testament in the days of
[1:57:55] Noah God was silent until he couldn't
[1:57:57] take it no more he allowed what happened
[1:58:01] to happen under silence because it was
[1:58:03] part of his strategy because in his mind
[1:58:05] he wanted to baptize the Earth all right
[1:58:08] and he had to have a reason to do so so
[1:58:10] he allowed the sin to grow until he
[1:58:12] couldn't take it no more he had watched
[1:58:13] for a long time but now he had found a
[1:58:16] righteous man in place that he could not
[1:58:18] break his silence and say build an ark
[1:58:21] I'm to baptize the Earth in the days of
[1:58:24] Moses for 400 years they were in bondage
[1:58:27] Moses had 40 Years of Silence but then
[1:58:30] God broke the silence amen can the
[1:58:32] church say amen and for many years in
[1:58:35] the message it would seem like we have
[1:58:37] been living under silence yes where are
[1:58:39] the Miracles where are the signs where
[1:58:41] are the Wonders where is the Dynamics
[1:58:43] that's been prophesied and we've been
[1:58:44] living under the testimony of Jesus with
[1:58:46] the spirit of Prophecy under the
[1:58:48] ministry of the word which is period of
[1:58:50] Silence Hallelujah because there's a
[1:58:52] Time coming of Dynamics there's a Time
[1:58:55] coming of power there's a Time coming
[1:58:57] when the silence comes to an end there
[1:58:59] was silence on Gideon's life there was
[1:59:01] silence in Abraham's life there was
[1:59:03] silence in Isaac and Jacob's life there
[1:59:05] was silence in Israel because golad had
[1:59:08] them pinned
[1:59:09] down nobody was moving only Goliath was
[1:59:13] speaking send me a man to fight me and
[1:59:15] all of Israel was covered in silence
[1:59:17] until David said said I am that man and
[1:59:20] God broke the silence with David can the
[1:59:23] church say amen and I'm saying this
[1:59:25] morning God is getting the ra to raise
[1:59:28] to break the silence not just on the
[1:59:30] bride but on
[1:59:32] individuals the silence that has kept
[1:59:34] you quiet thinking that your sickness is
[1:59:37] your promise is over we are going to
[1:59:39] break the silence this morning because
[1:59:42] if I hold my peace the rocks are going
[1:59:44] to cry out so I'm not going to be silent
[1:59:47] anymore I'm going to begin to declare
[1:59:49] I'm going to overcome I'm going to begin
[1:59:51] to declare I'm going to be healed by
[1:59:53] Stripes I'm Healed the silence is
[1:59:55] breaking this
[1:59:57] morning can the church say
[2:00:00] amen glory the Old Testament closes with
[2:00:04] words that hold meaning special meaning
[2:00:06] to us behold I send you Elijah the
[2:00:09] prophet before the coming of the great
[2:00:11] and Dreadful day of the Lord and he
[2:00:12] shall turn the hearts of the fathers to
[2:00:14] the children and the Heart of the
[2:00:16] children to their fathers lest they come
[2:00:17] and smite the Earth with a curse amen
[2:00:19] and these prophetic words held
[2:00:22] scripture between a Chasm of the Old
[2:00:25] Testament and the new and for 400 years
[2:00:27] there was silence for 400 years there
[2:00:29] was no message from God for 400 years no
[2:00:32] Prophet arose to give God's word for 400
[2:00:35] years no angel came and visit the people
[2:00:38] it was just silence and like the Calm
[2:00:41] before the storm God was getting ready
[2:00:43] to break his silence can the church
[2:00:45] sayen I'm not talking about man breaking
[2:00:48] the silence but I'm talking about God
[2:00:50] breaking the Silence of the SE on your
[2:00:52] life and when God gets ready to break
[2:00:54] the silence he does it a certain kind of
[2:00:57] way here comes God drops down the angel
[2:00:59] Gabriel to speak to Zachariah and his
[2:01:02] wife Elizabeth amen hallelujah because
[2:01:05] God is about to unfold something poor
[2:01:08] Elizabeth had lived with the Decades of
[2:01:10] being a barren woman her definition was
[2:01:13] not Elizabeth the great cook it was
[2:01:15] Elizabeth the baron woman it was a pain
[2:01:18] to her that she couldn't have a child
[2:01:19] and Zachariah husband was groan and
[2:01:22] travailing because he knew he wanted a
[2:01:24] son who would follow in his footsteps
[2:01:26] and he knew how his wife felt about it
[2:01:28] Zachariah was not somebody on the street
[2:01:30] he was a priest so he was in the house
[2:01:32] of God praying and and taring and
[2:01:35] seeking the Lord he understood as a
[2:01:37] priest that if you ask God for something
[2:01:39] God has an obligation to answer so he's
[2:01:42] there praying when the church comes
[2:01:44] together he's there praying he has he
[2:01:46] has a burden because he has a need and
[2:01:48] then all of a sudden one day he's there
[2:01:50] and then the a the angel Gabriel speaks
[2:01:52] to him do not be afraid Zachariah your
[2:01:55] prayer has been heard what an
[2:01:57] encouragement for after all your years
[2:01:59] of silence and crying and sighing to
[2:02:02] hear the angel of the Lord come and say
[2:02:03] don't worry brother kangali your prayer
[2:02:05] has been heard oh to know that God has
[2:02:08] heard your prayer that the vials of your
[2:02:10] prayer has been raised up and the
[2:02:12] perfume and the fragrance has reached to
[2:02:15] God and God is saying yes I'm ready to
[2:02:17] do something about it I'm ready to break
[2:02:19] the Silence of your baroness I've heard
[2:02:22] the cries of my people and I've come
[2:02:25] down can the church say
[2:02:28] Amen oh my don't be afraid Zachariah
[2:02:32] your prayer has been heard your wife
[2:02:34] Elizabeth will have a son and you are to
[2:02:36] give him the name
[2:02:38] John and this John in other words you
[2:02:40] may be SE could you imagine from
[2:02:42] baroness from a burden and then to be
[2:02:45] given a son who will have a message to
[2:02:47] make ready a people for the Lord a son
[2:02:50] to forun the coming of of the Messiah
[2:02:53] from baroness to a special kind of a son
[2:02:56] a son who will have the spirit of Elijah
[2:02:58] Zachariah was praying and he didn't even
[2:03:00] know how God is going to bless him
[2:03:02] beyond
[2:03:05] measure breaking the
[2:03:08] silence God uses the silence to do his
[2:03:11] work
[2:03:13] Hallelujah and Elizabeth is carrying
[2:03:15] child and meanwhile while this is
[2:03:17] unfolding C getting ready to talk to
[2:03:19] Mary Hail Mary th highly favored hallu
[2:03:23] because for years since the prophet
[2:03:26] spoke a virgin shall conceive there were
[2:03:29] silence in that scripture ministers
[2:03:32] would read the scripture and know it's
[2:03:34] in the word but they don't know how it's
[2:03:35] going to be fulfilled there was
[2:03:37] silence Discerning preachers could say
[2:03:40] one day of Virgin will conceive and
[2:03:42] people in church would hear it say maybe
[2:03:44] that's the word but we don't know how
[2:03:45] it's going to happen
[2:03:47] Lord preaching out of season but it's
[2:03:50] still the word so you have to say it
[2:03:52] oh you don't hear me this morning 600
[2:03:55] years in the preaching of Virgin will
[2:03:57] conceive because the prophet spoke it
[2:03:58] and we believe the prophet but it was
[2:04:00] not the season yet so the ministers
[2:04:03] sounded kind of crazy but when the
[2:04:05] season changed what was now out of
[2:04:07] season became in
[2:04:09] season and for years we have been
[2:04:11] talking about adoption talking about
[2:04:13] perfection talking about the
[2:04:14] Resurrection talking about the power
[2:04:16] coming to the church and for all the
[2:04:18] years it's been out of
[2:04:20] season but under the testimony of Jesus
[2:04:23] the spirit of Prophecy we have been
[2:04:25] under obligation to speak it because the
[2:04:27] word must cover the
[2:04:30] people if the word doesn't cover the
[2:04:32] people there's nothing to connect it so
[2:04:35] Mary is walking by the well she is well
[2:04:38] versed with the scripture she knows a
[2:04:40] virgin will conceive so when Gabriel
[2:04:42] comes and say hail Mary thou are highly
[2:04:46] [Applause]
[2:04:48] favor the word in her soul the
[2:04:50] predestinated
[2:04:52] because brother Bram taught us that you
[2:04:53] are not the believer but the word in you
[2:04:56] is the believer so when the word is in
[2:04:58] you the word has no choice but to
[2:05:01] respond Mary you're going to have a
[2:05:03] child you're going to bring forth
[2:05:05] Messiah you're going to bring forth the
[2:05:07] Christ her only question was how shall
[2:05:11] this
[2:05:12] be and before the Holy Ghost was poured
[2:05:15] out on the day of Pentecost the angel
[2:05:17] dropped a mystery upon her the season
[2:05:20] has changed to hold ghost is going to
[2:05:22] overshadow thee because
[2:05:25] [Applause]
[2:05:30] the breaking the
[2:05:33] silence and Mary Mary's now anointed
[2:05:38] she's now inspired God could never speak
[2:05:41] to you and you keep it to yourself God
[2:05:44] can never speak to you and you go to the
[2:05:46] corner and stay quiet when God spoke to
[2:05:49] her but the terance she ran to her
[2:05:51] cousin Elizabeth eleth and say Elizabeth
[2:05:53] you wouldn't believe what happened to me
[2:05:55] I went to church Sunday morning and the
[2:05:57] angel came to me and told me I'm going
[2:05:59] to have a child told me I'm going to get
[2:06:01] the Holy Ghost told me I'm going going
[2:06:03] to get a breakthrough and his name is
[2:06:05] going to be called wonderful his name is
[2:06:06] going to be called counselor this thing
[2:06:09] is going to be of the Holy Ghost his
[2:06:11] name
[2:06:14] glory and listen the baby in Elizabeth's
[2:06:18] wound the seed of Promise was dead for
[2:06:21] six mon that was all part of God's
[2:06:23] strategy because there's power in the
[2:06:25] name of Jesus there's power in the name
[2:06:28] of Jesus so when Mary stand to talk
[2:06:30] about counselor Mighty God Everlasting
[2:06:33] father Prince of Peace Jesus wonderful
[2:06:35] that baby in Elizabeth strategy being on
[2:06:39] he is the resurrection and the life he's
[2:06:40] not even born yet but resurrection power
[2:06:43] locked up inside of Mary John come to
[2:06:46] life begin to Rejoice because he knows
[2:06:50] he knows that the Messiah is already on
[2:06:52] the
[2:06:57] earth can the church say Amen can the
[2:07:01] church say Amen can the church say Amen
[2:07:05] the Holy Ghost is on the move he was
[2:07:07] moving he was fixing things around for
[2:07:09] the Messiah to be established and but
[2:07:11] the BR said the same holy ghost that
[2:07:13] justified the lutherans that sanctify
[2:07:16] the wans that baptized the Pentecostals
[2:07:18] is Now setting in order for the coming
[2:07:21] of the Lord Jesus Christ and it will be
[2:07:23] a Breaking of the silence for all these
[2:07:25] years the devil think is church church
[2:07:27] church church message message argument
[2:07:29] this Minister that Minister but we are
[2:07:31] way beyond that this morning the silence
[2:07:34] we have held our peace for a long time
[2:07:37] uh but there's a voice that's about to
[2:07:39] speak there's a voice that's going to
[2:07:41] speak and that voice has power that
[2:07:43] voice has resurrection that voice has
[2:07:45] life that voice will go after your
[2:07:47] children that voice will go after that
[2:07:49] cancer that voice will go after that
[2:07:52] can the church say
[2:07:54] Amen the silence is going to be broken
[2:07:57] so for all these years since the prophet
[2:08:00] left brother popwell we have been placed
[2:08:02] under silence we all had expectation you
[2:08:05] may be see that brother Bram said it's
[2:08:06] so close I could almost feel it but the
[2:08:09] brandham thought that he was going to
[2:08:11] experience it he thought he was going to
[2:08:13] see it but it was not for him ministers
[2:08:16] came after many ministers and under the
[2:08:19] spirit of Prophecy they were obligated
[2:08:21] to speak the same thing to anoint the
[2:08:24] promises to the People by faith because
[2:08:27] that's the only way to do it but you
[2:08:29] cannot change a season before the time
[2:08:31] comes can the church say Amen they had
[2:08:34] to be in the upper room uh and they were
[2:08:36] praising God continually but when the
[2:08:38] day of Pentecost was fully come then the
[2:08:42] season changed I got news for you this
[2:08:44] morning all your life you have been
[2:08:47] waited for your day of Pentecost and one
[2:08:49] of these days I could must feel it it's
[2:08:52] going to come and you're going to
[2:08:54] experience a wonderful glorious baptism
[2:08:58] on the inside that will transform to the
[2:09:01] outside and this Mortal will put on
[2:09:04] immortality you don't hear me this
[2:09:06] morning these 16 elements will
[2:09:11] [Applause]
[2:09:19] become could you take some more
[2:09:21] I'm not finished
[2:09:23] yet
[2:09:26] hallah
[2:09:27] Hallelujah and I love how God does it
[2:09:30] and that's why you got to trust God
[2:09:31] because God does things in stages you
[2:09:33] know Jesus is born we we know the story
[2:09:36] Bethlehem and everything and then they
[2:09:37] silence all right we hear nothing when
[2:09:39] he's 5 6 seven years old 8 nine but then
[2:09:41] all of a sudden we see another
[2:09:43] snapshot the family comes to to worship
[2:09:47] and to come for one of the celebration
[2:09:48] whatever and then Jesus gets lost all
[2:09:50] right
[2:09:52] hall hallelujah it was their custom of
[2:09:54] the feast and Jesus gets lost and and
[2:09:57] and and I want you to understand Mary
[2:10:00] and Joseph were so caught up in the
[2:10:03] custom and the tradition and the service
[2:10:04] that they actually didn't realize that
[2:10:06] they lost Jesus amen caught up in the
[2:10:09] religious tradition so much that they
[2:10:10] real that Jesus is missing could you
[2:10:12] imagine it come to church brother
[2:10:14] kangali and Jesus is
[2:10:17] missing they came for a religious feast
[2:10:21] and left without Jesus and he's the
[2:10:25] reason for the
[2:10:28] season Hallelujah and the Bible said for
[2:10:31] about three days they travel away until
[2:10:34] it occurred to them but Joseph yes Mary
[2:10:39] where Jesus you don't have him
[2:10:47] [Applause]
[2:10:50] no around the car all right and that
[2:10:53] they head back and they find Jesus right
[2:10:57] where they left him Jesus wasn't playing
[2:11:00] PlayStation playing Nintendo running
[2:11:03] around with everybody else Jesus was in
[2:11:04] the temple confounding the elders yes
[2:11:08] what scripture is that no that doesn't
[2:11:10] mean that look back into that scripture
[2:11:13] way I never see that 40 years I'm a
[2:11:15] minister 12y old Jesus the Bible said
[2:11:18] confounding the ministers all of the ERS
[2:11:21] are there now because they're saying we
[2:11:22] hearing stuff we never knew was there
[2:11:23] but it's right because all the
[2:11:24] scriptures finally lining up I so all
[2:11:26] get confused and Jesus opening their
[2:11:30] understanding and when they come to
[2:11:31] Jesus they say what you doing here he
[2:11:34] said don't you know I must be about my
[2:11:35] father's business and then it's as if
[2:11:38] the director says
[2:11:40] cut there's nothing
[2:11:42] else for 18 years brother the Kang
[2:11:45] there's
[2:11:46] silence 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23
[2:11:53] we hear nothing about This Man Called
[2:11:56] Jesus amen till age 30 right till out of
[2:12:00] Silence God breaks it once again and out
[2:12:03] steps Jesus amen walking down Hallelujah
[2:12:08] watch John preaching a message the AXS
[2:12:11] must be laid to the tree repent there's
[2:12:14] one
[2:12:17] comingall and John is preaching
[2:12:19] Masterpiece after masterpiece all
[2:12:22] right John is a disruptor he's breaking
[2:12:25] tradition his messages people coming to
[2:12:27] take notes nobody ever preached that
[2:12:29] hard
[2:12:31] before if it don't bring forth fruit
[2:12:34] chop axe chop what they want to eat wild
[2:12:38] honey and lo
[2:12:41] Locust see this Minister different he
[2:12:44] too hard too rough but then John begins
[2:12:47] to break into the realm because the same
[2:12:49] holy say there's one standing among amen
[2:12:52] hallelujah whose shoes are not even
[2:12:53] worthy and then Jesus
[2:12:56] breaks the
[2:13:00] silence thank you in the wilderness
[2:13:03] Jesus is there and the devil is probing
[2:13:06] at Jesus if thou be he wants a response
[2:13:08] Hallelujah he wants a response and Jesus
[2:13:11] just
[2:13:13] Hedges it is written it is written if
[2:13:16] thou be the devil trying to get me to
[2:13:18] see who he is it is written it is
[2:13:20] written not breaking the silence he's
[2:13:21] playing his part he's just he's like
[2:13:23] playing cricket and he
[2:13:26] just he not ready to hit it out the park
[2:13:29] just yet all right all right but then
[2:13:31] after he comes to the Wilderness he
[2:13:33] breaks the silence because God loves to
[2:13:35] do it in a certain kind of way so he
[2:13:36] comes in and the Bible
[2:13:39] says I want to read it exactly
[2:13:44] because and Jesus returning the power of
[2:13:47] the spirit Luke 4 into Galilee and they
[2:13:50] went out the
[2:13:51] Fame of him all around the region around
[2:13:53] and he taught in his synagogue being
[2:13:54] glorified of all
[2:13:56] and Hallelujah and he came to Nazareth
[2:14:00] where he had been brought up and as his
[2:14:01] custom
[2:14:02] was it wasn't something strange with a p
[2:14:05] he was always in church he went into the
[2:14:08] synagogue on the Sabbath day and stood
[2:14:09] up for the read and there was delivered
[2:14:11] unto him strategy somebody actually
[2:14:13] pulled the book that he needed didn't
[2:14:15] know why he was pulling that book but he
[2:14:17] brought it and he found the place the
[2:14:19] book of The Prophet is that when open he
[2:14:21] found a place where it is written the
[2:14:22] spirit of the Lord is upon me because he
[2:14:24] had anointed me to preach the gospel to
[2:14:26] the poor he had sent me to heal the
[2:14:28] broken hearted to preach Deliverance to
[2:14:30] the captives and recovering of sight to
[2:14:32] the Blind and set at Liberty bruise and
[2:14:34] to preach the acceptable of the Lord and
[2:14:36] when he closed the book and he gave it
[2:14:38] again to the minister and sat down and
[2:14:40] all the eyes that were in the synagogue
[2:14:42] were fastened on him and then he began
[2:14:44] to say to them this day is the scripture
[2:14:46] fulfilled in your ears amen and he broke
[2:14:50] the silence amen because they had heard
[2:14:52] that scripture many times before but
[2:14:54] never was there anybody who said this
[2:14:56] day this scripture is fulfilled and he
[2:14:59] said Not Another word and from there was
[2:15:01] just signs wonders and miracles amen and
[2:15:04] that's how God breaks am the silence
[2:15:07] amen I'm getting ready to why now now
[2:15:10] can the church say Amen can we give the
[2:15:11] Lord a hand of
[2:15:18] Praise so but brandham taught us music
[2:15:21] the musician can get ready that a seal
[2:15:23] signifies a finished work all right a
[2:15:25] seal
[2:15:27] signifies approval and he spoke up the
[2:15:30] box car and said when it is filled the
[2:15:32] right way it is sealed until its
[2:15:35] destination and the seal is necessary to
[2:15:37] protect what's on the inside until the
[2:15:40] time appointed yes for it to be opened
[2:15:44] in other words you're not to touch it
[2:15:45] until it reaches its
[2:15:47] destination and we know that Seven Seals
[2:15:50] was the book of Redemption yes so only
[2:15:52] when you open a seal and look at the
[2:15:54] contents could you know what's redeemed
[2:15:57] in that seal all right so the first seal
[2:16:00] to the fourth seal identified how Satan
[2:16:03] infiltrated the church by the Antichrist
[2:16:05] spirit with four Riders White Horse red
[2:16:07] horse black horse Pale Horse and though
[2:16:10] Satan caused havoc in the church God
[2:16:12] still did a work of redemption we know
[2:16:15] that God sent a lion ox man and eagle
[2:16:17] and a great drama was being unfolded
[2:16:21] when he open the fifth seal we see
[2:16:22] another work of redemption the
[2:16:24] Redemption of the Jews The Sixth Seal is
[2:16:26] to come is a judgment seal but when he
[2:16:27] open the seventh seal there was silence
[2:16:30] amen hallelujah because under the
[2:16:32] silence under the radar visible yet
[2:16:34] invisible the God that was once
[2:16:38] invisible silent was doing something
[2:16:41] Jesus Christ the same yesterday today
[2:16:43] and forever he had Chang form once again
[2:16:46] and a work of redemption was going on
[2:16:48] Amen every other seal had symbol but the
[2:16:52] seven seal is Christ amen so the Lord
[2:16:55] himself descended with a shout amen
[2:16:58] could it be that you became that living
[2:17:00] symbol Hallelujah that in there was the
[2:17:03] bride to a sign of going back to Eden
[2:17:06] back to the spoken word can the church
[2:17:08] say Amen brother brandom taught us every
[2:17:10] seal had a word A History A age a vision
[2:17:13] and a People yes the first to the fourth
[2:17:16] seal had their ages the church ages Lord
[2:17:19] is everybody with me this morning we're
[2:17:21] going somewhere the fifth seal has it
[2:17:23] age with the Jews The Sixth Seal is the
[2:17:26] age of the tribulation The Sixth Seal
[2:17:28] will have a history of only three and a
[2:17:30] half years but what about the seventh
[2:17:34] seal the seventh seal also has its
[2:17:36] history we can look back to the prophet
[2:17:39] can the church say Amen the seven seal
[2:17:41] as it age it's a bride
[2:17:43] age but hidden under that seal s is it
[2:17:47] time to break the silence to break it of
[2:17:51] Heaven silence what is this about church
[2:17:54] Adam lost the book Hallelujah Glory the
[2:17:57] book of power the book of redemption the
[2:17:59] book of name and Satan tried to grab it
[2:18:02] because if Adam did not fall he was
[2:18:04] going to take that book and call your
[2:18:06] name spoken word you were going to come
[2:18:10] forth but Adam lost the book and Satan
[2:18:12] tried to grab it but this book has
[2:18:15] Biometrics it's only certain people
[2:18:17] could handle this book so when the book
[2:18:20] Satan thought he had it because if Satan
[2:18:22] got the book he would have had your
[2:18:24] names but he was not authorized he
[2:18:26] didn't have the password he didn't have
[2:18:29] the permission to go into that book so
[2:18:31] the book fell back into the hands of the
[2:18:33] original owner It could only be viewed
[2:18:36] by certain
[2:18:38] people can the church say
[2:18:41] amen amen but even though the book had
[2:18:45] been taken back it needed a redeemer
[2:18:48] somebody authorized to open the book
[2:18:51] it had to be family to
[2:18:54] us because that was the law it could
[2:18:57] only be family to redeem you your
[2:19:00] neighbor can't redeem you not even a
[2:19:02] king could redeem you only your family
[2:19:04] could redeem you so when Jesus came as
[2:19:07] part of his strategy that never changes
[2:19:10] he became the kinsman redeemer he became
[2:19:13] your family when you had no family
[2:19:18] he your blood and his blood same
[2:19:22] DNA he could identify with you more than
[2:19:25] you could identify with yourself because
[2:19:29] he suffered amen so that he understands
[2:19:33] how you could
[2:19:34] suffer he went through pain so he
[2:19:37] understands your pain amen so he's not
[2:19:39] suffering in isolation he took your sin
[2:19:43] he took your pain he took your problem
[2:19:46] and as a Kings neighbor he died in your
[2:19:49] place and he dying there he said father
[2:19:52] it is
[2:19:53] finished and Heaven began a shake the
[2:19:56] Bible said there was an earthquake the
[2:19:58] Skies begin to change color the trees
[2:20:01] begin to move the plants begin to shake
[2:20:04] why you may be seated because the plants
[2:20:06] and the trees and nature they remember
[2:20:08] how it was when Adam was
[2:20:12] there nature remembers how it was when
[2:20:15] Adam was there and the whole of creation
[2:20:18] where the Jason is groaning and
[2:20:19] travailing for the manifestation of the
[2:20:23] sons of God but the sons of God cannot
[2:20:26] come forth until this book could be
[2:20:29] placed in the right hands so God's
[2:20:31] strategy from Genesis to Revelation from
[2:20:35] time out of Eternity was to place this
[2:20:38] book back into the hands of sons Place
[2:20:41] power back into the hands of sons for
[2:20:44] sons of God to step out and speak the
[2:20:47] way Adam
[2:20:49] spoke you may be
[2:20:52] seated you may be
[2:20:54] seated can the church say Amen everybody
[2:20:57] with me we we could take some more
[2:21:00] right Hallelujah one of these days where
[2:21:02] the Andrew will break into eternity and
[2:21:04] it wouldn't be time no more so for all
[2:21:07] the ages when Jesus was here we preached
[2:21:09] it before he took fish he said what do
[2:21:11] you have he said we have Five Loaves and
[2:21:13] two fish he said bring it he blessed it
[2:21:15] and he broke it and they ate it he took
[2:21:17] raw materials and he changed it he said
[2:21:19] what do you have water bring it turn it
[2:21:22] into
[2:21:23] [Music]
[2:21:24] wine but Adam didn't need raw
[2:21:28] materials because he's a
[2:21:30] Creator and Jesus could only do so much
[2:21:33] because for him to be complete he needs
[2:21:35] his
[2:21:37] wife but every law has to be fulfilled
[2:21:40] so in Jewish custom when the Harvest is
[2:21:42] about to come there has to be somebody
[2:21:45] waves the first crop to show that the
[2:21:47] rest are coming so in our day God also a
[2:21:50] strategy he placed a Inside Man
[2:21:53] everything we preached about God wrapped
[2:21:55] into his prophet he lost his wife he
[2:21:58] lost his child he lost the
[2:22:00] [Music]
[2:22:04] anointing but this same 20th century
[2:22:06] prophet he didn't need a squirrel to
[2:22:09] make another squirrel this same prophet
[2:22:11] he said let there be a squirrel and
[2:22:14] Heaven began to shake the Earth began to
[2:22:16] shake the trees began to shake because
[2:22:19] they recognize Adam is on the again
[2:22:21] brother pram didn't come just to
[2:22:24] demonstrate it he came to bring evidence
[2:22:27] that the new land is Within Reach and we
[2:22:30] have been living by the evidence of the
[2:22:32] new land the son of man The Silence has
[2:22:36] already been
[2:22:40] broken oh my everybody with me this
[2:22:44] morning you see why I'm excited why I'm
[2:22:48] encouraged why because there are people
[2:22:49] here brother the Joshua who will speak
[2:22:52] and see their worlds change they will
[2:22:54] speak to their homes they will speak to
[2:22:56] their families they will speak to their
[2:22:58] situation just like Lazarus was dead
[2:23:02] tied up and God's strategy he wanted to
[2:23:06] leave a secret for all of you who think
[2:23:08] the situation is so messed up there's no
[2:23:09] recovery he said you know what let me
[2:23:11] let
[2:23:13] me come
[2:23:16] on you know what the Bible said Jesus
[2:23:19] was in Lazarus Village a while before
[2:23:21] you know but when Jesus was there he ran
[2:23:23] into some problems with the people so
[2:23:26] when he heard that Lazarus was sick he
[2:23:29] didn't want to go because the last time
[2:23:30] he was there the people had issues with
[2:23:32] him all right but the delay was also
[2:23:36] deliberate because Lazarus had to die
[2:23:38] and when he heard Lazarus was dead he
[2:23:40] said now all the people who are there
[2:23:41] now I can go because the problems I have
[2:23:43] will disappear when Lazarus come forth
[2:23:47] yes that's what the Bible said Jesus
[2:23:49] couldn't go because the people are pro
[2:23:51] but when Jesus got there they all
[2:23:53] mour the same people who upset the whole
[2:23:55] neighborhood when Jesus got there they
[2:23:57] all mour so Mary and say if you had been
[2:23:58] here my brother would not have died he
[2:24:00] said roll away the
[2:24:01] stone and when Jesus said Lazarus come
[2:24:04] forth the critics the haters those who
[2:24:08] were upset with the message he preached
[2:24:10] before their mouths were shut you see
[2:24:11] Lazarus coming out like
[2:24:13] this they say I can't Vex with Jesus no
[2:24:16] more Lazarus is my boy Lazarus is my
[2:24:17] friend amen amen Lazarus was dead now
[2:24:20] he's alive and he was tied up they say
[2:24:23] loose him and let him
[2:24:26] go that's the voice that's coming into
[2:24:28] the
[2:24:29] bride can the church say Amen so I don't
[2:24:32] care what condition your son is in your
[2:24:34] wife your husband it doesn't matter they
[2:24:37] are coming out and even when they come
[2:24:39] out whatever still tiing them up we're
[2:24:41] going to loose them loose them let them
[2:24:45] go they're going to be free and God has
[2:24:48] never changed his strategy somebody say
[2:24:52] Amen you may be
[2:24:54] seated let me try to come to a
[2:24:58] close what time is it I a couple weeks
[2:25:01] ago I lost my watch so I start to lose
[2:25:03] track of time okay with a check on yeah
[2:25:07] I didn't bring the watch I'm preparing
[2:25:09] for
[2:25:11] eternity so the book could only be used
[2:25:13] by certain hand viewed by certain eyes
[2:25:15] so we needed a redeemer and John wept
[2:25:18] because when he looked around there was
[2:25:19] nobody worthy to take the book but then
[2:25:22] the bleeding lamb Ste forward and tore
[2:25:25] off the seals no wonder John shouted
[2:25:28] because he knew that finally the silence
[2:25:31] that was placed on the Earth from Adam's
[2:25:33] day was about to be broken can the
[2:25:36] church say Amen oh I'm about to finish
[2:25:38] out now everybody feeling
[2:25:41] fine my my my my
[2:25:44] my oh hallelujah
[2:25:47] hallelujah hallelujah Hal hallelujah
[2:25:51] hallelujah so God is about to break the
[2:25:53] silence every Church age every Church
[2:25:56] age was leading up to this time now when
[2:25:58] God is about to break the silence to
[2:26:00] restore Fallen man back to his position
[2:26:04] never before could have been manifested
[2:26:06] Sons like this day now where Sons will
[2:26:08] speak and create where Sons will speak
[2:26:11] and deliverance will take place and
[2:26:13] brother said something powerful a couple
[2:26:15] weeks ago he said it's not just the
[2:26:17] voice but behind the voice is a man and
[2:26:19] I love that because anybody could speak
[2:26:22] but there's the character behind the man
[2:26:25] that makes the voice into something
[2:26:26] somebody could say stop but when you see
[2:26:29] a police officer because that voice is
[2:26:32] backed by a man in Authority you respect
[2:26:34] that voice so this voice of the
[2:26:36] Archangel with Christ behind the voice
[2:26:39] Christ veiling a bride when that voice
[2:26:41] speaks and the silence is broken brother
[2:26:44] talk about a jubilee talk about a
[2:26:46] Revival talk about a Breaking Free
