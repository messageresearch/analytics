[34:46] fresh foot not the message but the
[34:48] original bit that's why the faith is a
[34:51] team back to heart the feet the messages
[34:53] turn our hearts back to the feet of the
[34:54] fathers isn't that right and God wanted
[34:56] atmosphere for this bird isn't that
[34:59] right
[34:59] that Monsieur of what default
[35:02] sanctification clean worshipping or
[35:06] praising God a constant expectation or
[35:10] glory to God or when you come here with
[35:11] that kind of expectation I know faith is
[35:13] working in you
[35:14] because faith is ever an expression
[35:16] works is always fear to express you
[35:19] can't talk this wait you have to show
[35:22] this faith you have to express this way
[35:24] I know but the message thing I'm talking
[35:26] about the word thing
[35:28] I know what people have here I'm talking
[35:30] more what the Bible expect of us or
[35:32] Godfrey revelation bring expectation
[35:35] hallelujah understanding and knowledge
[35:37] and information have no expectation and
[35:40] that you could read a lot in newspapers
[35:42] you could read it in a magazine but when
[35:44] God give you revelation it brings
[35:46] expectation for a manifestation God
[35:49] doesn't give you a fit for nothing he
[35:51] tell Abram you have a son that's a
[35:53] promise and that give him the faith to
[35:56] believe
[35:56] Isaac was coming and he was an old man
[35:59] what in his whole life I had to believe
[36:02] her because coordinates speak to her she
[36:05] didn't have a revelation but he had to
[36:07] fit and you have to live that out for 25
[36:11] years everyone believed God you can't
[36:14] stop now

[36:38] or forget the title the title have
[36:42] tonight is he shall come to us as rain
[36:45] that's from whose gs6 he shall come to
[36:50] us a dream I'll have an inspiration and
[36:54] this is from this from Luke 18 when the
[36:58] son of man commits shall we find feet on
[37:00] the it hallelujah when the son of man
[37:03] commits shall define feet in here maybe
[37:05] I'll take a quick look at that scripture
[37:06] oh praise the name of the Lord if we
[37:09] consider tonight Luke chapter 18 but
[37:13] before that was Luke chapter 17
[37:18] okay and Luke 17 says likewise 28 as it
[37:23] wasn't is a lot to eat drank they bought
[37:26] they sold they planted they builded the
[37:28] same day that lot went out of Sodom it
[37:30] reinforced on from heaven and destroy
[37:32] them all
[37:33] notice the simplicity and the the normal
[37:37] livin that was an operation when this
[37:41] was happening you see under the normal
[37:43] circumstance the sunrise sunset
[37:45] everything normal to eat the build go to
[37:47] work pay the bills but something is up
[37:50] then in the realm of the spirit because
[37:54] in the supernatural realm because Abram
[37:56] is elected the angel is with Abraham
[37:58] given him a revelation of the judgment
[38:00] that is fixed and set that God not put
[38:02] the canceled it's already set or glory
[38:05] that God God's not gonna cancel it
[38:07] already set
[38:08] that's why Berman said we are striving
[38:10] to enter into the kingdom of God before
[38:13] these horrible plague strike so you see
[38:16] where the virus come in the coronavirus
[38:18] and people getting scared and and what

[38:32] the manifestation the sons of God Abba
[38:34] stop cancer stop these plagues so that
[38:37] the plagues coming this way and the sons
[38:39] of God comin this way

[38:46] coming I'll go tell them plates
[38:48] recommend any sons the one that come in
[38:50] alone
[38:50] the only reason vodka same place the
[38:52] because sons of God coming nicest ones
[38:55] I've got to challenge that poor glory of
[38:57] God God raised up from the challenge
[38:58] that they not doctor for us in to hide

[55:09] condition come let's see a patient's
[55:18] Honore when the collision come let me
[55:20] see the minister have the we call
[55:23] intrapersonal skills
[55:26] that is that is the ability to control
[55:29] your emotions and your issues on the
[55:32] inside and don't allow that to rule you
[55:36] and rule your judgment because if they
[55:38] don't have that internal skills on the
[55:40] inside that internal check and balances
[55:43] the inside your emotions gonna rule you
[55:45] and you will judge things by your
[55:47] feelings and by your emotions and you
[55:49] kind of do that or nothing leadership or
[55:52] glory they've got to be a call to a
[55:54] higher order or glory to God forgive for
[55:57] Christ's sake or glory to God even if
[55:59] you're getting pressure for Christ's
[56:01] sake drop it let go you got to get up
[56:04] cause faith is based upon forgiveness I
[56:07] don't care what anybody do you
[56:09] you have to let it go in a little flower
[56:10] see this piece up unforgiveness the
[56:13] faith to pull you on charity when you
[56:14] stand praying for charity forgive if you
[56:17] have ought against honey there's got to
[56:19] come with a real revelation of brotherly
[56:22] kindness
[56:30] so this spirit is a bright spirit that
[56:35] desert break
[56:36] as Christ's spirit that is to be in you
[56:40] that is prophesied to come become the
[56:43] past I report my spirit that's my spirit
[56:46] that consists of seven parts it's spirit
[56:49] to come upon your life do you believe
[56:51] that do you expect that
[56:53] okay now his spirit couldn't have been
[56:56] released to the ages in that way in that
[57:00] measure because the world was lost in
[57:03] seven ages but he sent seven angels from
[57:06] eternity to get it back together he
[57:10] calleth discovered wood to tie it back
[57:13] in the world to bring don't know where
[57:15] he goes so the holy verse will only come
[57:17] where the holy was with his act because
[57:20] the word and the spirit are one so to
[57:24] the ages because the word was lost
[57:26] bought at a burning good reveal impact
[57:28] pad pad pad pad pad so when he sent a
[57:32] prophet he was I'm a prophet the God of
[57:34] all hallelujah so he said the fullness

[1:01:05] I know that this is judge Fuchs cuz I'm
[1:01:09] having a form of godliness and then we
[1:01:11] have them to giants them to intellectual
[1:01:14] guys Jerris and Jambres withstood movses
[1:01:18] so will these resists the truth men of
[1:01:21] corrupt minds
[1:01:23] concerning the feet the Caprice
[1:01:26] everything but defeat because if it if
[1:01:30] there is not a token if it is a
[1:01:32] manifestation
[1:01:32] that's why Paul's told and he said I
[1:01:35] didn't come with you with enticing words
[1:01:36] of man's wisdom because I see if you if
[1:01:38] I bring that know your fate chorus on
[1:01:40] that because I could bring it real Nance
[1:01:42] I teaching you this thing you said but I

[1:02:02] it happened in Nice Bible teachers he's
[1:02:04] in a real good word but it have no it
[1:02:09] has no she came the glory
[1:02:11] upon the manner that is being spoken no
[1:02:16] unction no no inspiration and this is
[1:02:19] what you need but once a good priest and
[1:02:22] all the hair fall out it has to be
[1:02:23] inspired to you
[1:02:26] so the first never have to fight is
[1:02:28] worship the first thing ever right is
[1:02:32] singing
[1:02:44] very informational but no not
[1:02:46] inspirational
[1:02:49] let me say that again that's one good
[1:02:50] very informational but not inspirational

[1:03:33] with time I ring for Khloe to go be
[1:03:35] puffy signed is that the rain is on its
[1:03:38] way God said so or glory to God amen
[1:03:43] so know the script to be read I read at
[1:03:47] the night on purpose think I wanted to
[1:03:49] identify that the Scriptures the two
[1:03:53] spirits work in the framework of the
[1:03:55] church so this is one spirit here which
[1:03:59] is fungus the computer one four to seven
[1:04:00] which is faith and virtue and knowledge
[1:04:02] and temperance all this here and this
[1:04:04] other one here is in X period which is
[1:04:07] traitors heady highminded lovers of
[1:04:09] pleasures more than lovers of God
[1:04:10] trucebreakers without natural affection
[1:04:12] fast Feliz distributor parents and
[1:04:15] tongue for holy and any message
[1:04:20] it was I see him and Estella toot
[1:04:24] I'm not begging vmm I push in true
[1:04:28] Hollywood cut these guys these guys with
[1:04:33] this truth and god his attitude from
[1:04:36] where the in one path that way caught
[1:04:39] one treat from not your mode from your
[1:04:41] heart waiting boy called David a man
[1:04:43] after my own heart
[1:04:44] if it was will be a sucker be able to do
[1:04:45] all kind of stuff but God see what is
[1:04:47] new man huh
[1:04:48] you can't beat that letter somebody
[1:04:50] there things we can control and they are
[1:04:52] things God alone can control there's
[1:04:54] certain things you cannot control Paul
[1:04:56] that's God's business but your business
[1:04:58] you could see about that
[1:04:59] or glory to God and we are confident and
[1:05:02] responsible to see what God put in our
[1:05:04] hands let's continue
[1:05:06] he said no watch remember Christ in the
[1:05:09] true church is a continuation of the
[1:05:11] book of Acts and the book of Revelation
[1:05:13] shows how the Antichrist spirit will
[1:05:15] come enter the church and defile it
[1:05:16] mechanic lukewarm formalin powerless so
[1:05:19] so that's what he'd ever come to squeeze
[1:05:22] the holy spirit out of the church and
[1:05:25] once the whole spread common a church
[1:05:27] you have to take up a man come on
[1:05:29] explain God and explain in words so you
[1:05:31] know what spirit you know many all kind
[1:05:33] of Revelation some cuckoo some crazy
[1:05:36] some plumb of the wood but whoo yeah
[1:05:38] because spirit okay you know is I enjoy
[1:05:40] talking is somebody talking somebody
[1:05:41] tellin things and that is why the
[1:05:44] Prophet said the spirit
[1:05:46] and the bride and the Prophet will see
[1:05:51] the same thing and what they see will
[1:05:55] already be set in the world so we can
[1:05:58] save new things as he same all things

[1:06:08] know already everything I'm saying is
[1:06:10] and as you have heard before but in the
[1:06:13] season and time but officially inspire
[1:06:15] and transform you from where you are the
[1:06:20] way you're supposed to me or glory to
[1:06:23] God because every service you need
[1:06:25] revelation and revelation is the
[1:06:27] operation of the Holy Ghost that
[1:06:29] translate and interpret the word as the
[1:06:31] word is spoken to you so you have
[1:06:33] Harriet intellectually you're hearing in
[1:06:35] my revelation so you could get it wrong
[1:06:38] in here and the man next we don't even

[1:27:42] using the eyes they're not looking at
[1:27:46] what God says they're looking at the
[1:27:48] eyes his eyes see and Giants say I see
[1:27:52] you see they're not looking at the
[1:27:53] unseen
[1:27:54] they're looking at the scene and God
[1:27:57] hinted that that is almost disrespect to

[1:28:28] fathers ate manna in the wilderness
[1:28:29] isn't there everyone dead and the
[1:28:32] professor that is eternal separation of
[1:28:34] God so that's why I say the same God had
[1:28:36] been closed and dismissible touch them

[1:32:32] us as the bride of Jesus Christ
[1:32:37] The Killers message will so-called have
[1:32:40] to reject the capstone Christ Jesus
[1:32:44] manifested in my brain
[1:32:49] this manifestation of God or this
[1:32:54] unveiling of God that is the comfort in
[1:32:57] a bride which will declare the
[1:33:01] manifestation of the sons of God this
[1:33:04] manifestation is guaranteed
[1:33:08] this is called order
[1:33:11] Christ is manifested the church rejects
[1:33:15] it then the government comes down
[1:33:21] Club will not change that order
[1:33:25] the government cannot come down until
[1:33:27] Christ is manifested one to the church
[1:33:31] will reject it when Jesus came didn't
[1:33:36] who he was 18 years of silence from age
[1:33:40] 11 or whatever 12:30 status ministry
[1:33:45] then afterwards shake up the church
[1:33:47] world you could shake up the church
[1:33:50] world Rome had nothing to do with that
[1:33:56] that was not a governmental issue that
[1:33:59] was Church issue that was a trumpet
[1:34:02] sounded calling a scriptural war because
[1:34:06] Jesus was one the summary our prophesied
[1:34:09] as Messiah hallelujah he came unto his
[1:34:13] own his own received him not
[1:34:15] they rejected him the Messiah he raised
[1:34:19] the dead he cast out devils heal a sick
[1:34:21] the church will reject him describe who
[1:34:24] could not agree with the Pharisees and
[1:34:26] the Pharisees couldn't agree with the
[1:34:27] Sadducees and the Sadducees could not
[1:34:29] really he sees the better audience and
[1:34:31] all of them get together and form this -
[1:34:33] Council
[1:34:35] that is where your world college is
[1:34:37] coming from deformation of build people
[1:34:40] to reject my sire but Messiah have to
[1:34:43] convert first just like he said the two
[1:34:47] anointed comfort first then these guys
[1:34:50] come after that
[1:34:59] so Jesus ministry started in baby form
[1:35:03] he didn't water into wine he said a grow
[1:35:06] grow grow until Lazarus recently dead
[1:35:09] but that was a climb up there was a
[1:35:10] capstone they say all men go after him
[1:35:12] we need emergency ministers meeting and
[1:35:16] we have to stop this manifest said we
[1:35:18] have to do something about it then they
[1:35:21] had to pass the little bribe and talk to

[1:36:25] kiss
[1:36:29] when they finish with Jesus they went to
[1:36:33] ask for enforcement of laws because this
[1:36:36] man claimed to be the Christ then dem
[1:36:40] except a room to intervene I said bring
[1:36:43] him and by that come to the priests
[1:36:45] place you want Barabbas or Jesus he
