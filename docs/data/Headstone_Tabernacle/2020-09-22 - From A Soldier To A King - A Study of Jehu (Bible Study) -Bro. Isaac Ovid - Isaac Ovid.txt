children lord as your sons and your daughters lord as father i so love to say in the cool of the evening lord as you would come down to fellowship with adam lord you so love to have fellowship with your children how you longed for fellowship lord you longed to have a relationship the attributes that was in you lord that father desired to have that family a family of god lord a family that you could come down with and find out how the day was and how lord adam made decisions and and for him to express the nature of his work and what he did and what he was doing and father how that communion was broken with the fall of man and since that time until now you lord lord have been fighting lord to see that communion re-establish and to see our position lord establish the way lord you thought it to be so we come this evening lord so lord get a deeper insight into your thinking into your thoughts father because through your word you have found this secret way to let us know who you are your nature your being your attributes through your word lord you have disguised your nature through your word you have hidden your mind in the word lord and lord hid it so well that you hid it from the eyes of the wise and the prudent and choose to reveal it to babes that would learn who come with a willing attitude who come forgetting their past their mistakes forgetting the hustle and the bustle of the day forgetting the distractions that could so easily be set us and we come tonight though to be drawn higher higher in your love deeper in your word lord to understand lord that you're a god of mercy but you're also a god of judgment lord you're also god of plans your god of purpose your god who thinks so far ahead of us that before we even lord became known lord as we are currently known you already thought about us father so lord may you speak to us tonight through your word as we approach this bible study tonight lord may you take me out of the way may you speak to your children may you open our understanding to the scriptures tonight we commit each brother and sister into your hands lord if there's anyone not feeling well anyone lord battling any type of situation me as the word goes forth made of peace that surpass it all understanding lord enter their rooms enter their cars their houses wherever they may be right now lord make yourself real to us and speak to us lord walk out the pages of the bibles straight into our hearts father we commit lord this evening into your hands in the precious name of jesus christ amen and amen and amen it is certainly a great privilege to be here tonight once again for our weekly bible study and uh it is it is quite a journey in scripture uh that the lord has been taking us through and such a humbling experience to be able to speak and find uh try to capture the mind of god for us and just in some way encourage us i always like to introduce by saying this is not a preaching service it is it is a bible study and uh it helps us fulfill for those who have not found that balance in life and have made a decision to be consistent uh in their daily meditation you know the bible says god told joshua meditate on the word day and night and you will have good success and that's a principle that's guaranteed to work because if you do what god says he is obligated to make his word come to pass so we are here to fulfill that are we also here to you know not read a bible like a novel or a book but to really capture the mind of god and through god's wisdom and the age that we are in that he chose to send a prophet not just a prophet not just a major prophet but a star in the right hand of god a prophet like no other prophet who would open the word open the book so that when we read the scriptures we are reading from that open book tonight and uh i found myself the last few sessions in second kings and we are still in second kings uh tonight and second kings is when you think that you know a lot was happening in that period then you begin to read more and realize whoa this is this is a lot it's a lot but uh i said last week we were we were reading uh about the shunamite and we were uh uh you know talking about that and we said in order to to go to eight we had to go back to four um you know and kind of pick up uh where it started before we could um properly go to eat and tonight i want to try to go to nine but to go to nine we actually need to go back to first kings before we could even approach nine you know so um we have quite a little bit of of of reading to do tonight so uh bear with me but we will our primary text will be in in in second kings but to really get to where we're going we need to rewind the tape a little bit and go back a little earlier to place a context and to actually show you know how long range of a vision god has concerning certain things and this should show us a few things it should show us that god is not now deciding he is not now understanding what's unfolding he is not now putting things in place and he's a god of his word in our teaching tonight we're going to see that god is a god of instruction and you know sometimes we we get things coming to us and things to do or we get inspiration to do things and we realize that sometimes the inspiration we get may be the right inspiration even if it lines up with certain things it makes you you know kind of really you know just just teaching it's still kind of blowing my mind a bit as i was as going through it um preparing for tonight so bear with me tonight and i want to start off uh by uh you know i want to give it a little title um and it's a very simple title but i want to call it title from a soldier to a king a study of jehu all right that's my title from a soldier to a king a study of jehu um so our focus tonight will be on jehu and to kind of lay a bit of a background now we we know that you know when samuel was prophet the children of israel at that time would have been looking outwards when they should have been looking inward they were looking outward and they made this declaration that we want a king also because we see other nations other people other kingdoms kingdoms have kings but we have no king and god said to samuel they have not rejected you they have really rejected me because you know i am the king and through that god allowed are using the word allowed samuel to anoint saul and saul as it were was chosen loved by the people he was a people's man and while he was yet in office uh god said to samuel well i found a better man and we know this to be king david so i'm kind of laying a bit of a foundation and we have quite a bit of reading tonight so i trust you i have your bibles i trust you have your notes and i want you to ride with me because i know that there will be a lot tonight that you may not have looked at like this so i want to challenge you uh we gonna reach back to second kings but we need to go back to kind of lay this foundation so after saul i want us to understand that the children of israel were all together you know the tribes were one people they worked together each had their ministry their portfolio their jurisdiction their inheritance they had their specializations who were farmers who raised animals the levites had the responsibility the spiritual things you know the warrior tribe so judah was the was the the the warlords you had all of these things going on and under king david it it worked well david's son king solomon became king and the territory of of israel as it were or what biblical scholars would call the united israel was even larger but when solomon died and solomon's son took over the kingdom was divided on the southern side would have been basically tribes of judah and benjamin and thus became the kingdom of judah with jerusalem basically within that territory all right so in the south would be the kingdom of judah therein would be jerusalem and the northern kingdom which would have consisted that the remaining tribes was called israel so people read the bible and and and sometimes they miss the subtlety with the reference with this was the king and then they heard there's another king and the reality is the king of israel and the king of judah it was this wonderful family as it were had been divided because of a disagreement over a number of things we've been getting here tonight uh but led to that separation of the kingdom or or the kingdom of judah as it will and the kingdom of israel with jerusalem being basically the capital in judah and samaria be in the capital uh in in israel all right and we find and i'm going back now to to kind of start this we have to go back to fullest kings so you can ride with me a bit because we will need to move a little quickly but we're going to go to first kings uh 16 and we'll find out that after the the establishment of two short-lived capitals in shechem and tusa king omri which should have been the king you know as they were moving on would have established his capital at samaria for the northern kingdom of israel where for the remainder of the northern kingdom existence so mario would have been the capital as it were or the principal city now in first kings 16 um we find in verse 29 first kings 16 and verse 29 and in the 30th and eighth year of asa king of judah all right so we already seen this distinction between the kingdoms in the 38th year of asa king of judah began ahab the son of omri we just mentioned his name there to reign over israel so asa is king in judah and ahab the son of omri to reign over israel he had the son of of iran over israel in samaria 22 years and listen carefully this is verse 30 and ahab the son of armory did evil in the sight of the lord above all that were before him we don't have time to go into all of it tonight but by this time things were getting from bad to worse but here we have a situation where where the bible says that ahab the son of omri did evil in the sight of the lord above all that were before him so this was now the worst king was now sitting in power and verse 31 and it came to pass listen carefully as if it had been a light thing for him to walk in the sins of jeroboam the son of nabat so in other words as if it was easy to walk in the sins of jeroboam meaning meaning it was not easy to be as bad as jeroboam but ahab was actually worse so the bible is saying in other words you have to work hard to be as evil as king jeroboam king jeroboam was so horrible that in writing this they were saying despite how hard it was to be as bad as jeroboam ahab actually was worse and listen that he took to wife jezebel so this is where he started to go from bad to worse he took to wife jezebel the daughter of ethebal king of the zenonians and went so is as a result of this marriage to this young lady who was not of israel not of their belief not of their persuasion in fact zidonia is the equivalent of modern day lebanon so she would have been what would have been called a phoenician and the phoenicians had their culture had their beliefs they were idol worshippers they would simply god bald they had women very active in in in the religious duties of the day as it were and so abe so so ahab married this woman named jezebel and went and served bayer lobel and worshiped him so it is the first time we are seeing the introduction of this increased level of idolatry so when you read it through brother branham's teaching he would talk about and ahab married jezebel and introduced idolatry amongst the people all right so it is not as simple as this though because listen to verse 32 so this is this is a son this is a king this is somebody of the of the tribe of a descendant of israel this is somebody who is now king over israel someone who would have known the stories of egypt and moses and know the history of abraham understand all of this before and here it is as a result of his marriage to jezebel verse 32 and you read up an all tougher bill and it is not just he has an altar for bill but the bible says in the house of will so it's it's two things not just you have an altar but you build a house so you actually created a temple and in the temple you'll create an altar in azerbai which he had built in samaria and ahab made a grove and ahab did more to provoke the lord god of israel to anger than all the kings of israel that were before him you see how serious that is so i want to make a point here now so here we have a king and he has made a decision because we talk about the only time life is about choices life is about decisions he has had a choice he's going to marry somebody from his tribe he can embrace somebody from his people whatever the motivation was whatever the reason was because every single person when they make a decision if there's any level of reasoning in your mind most people could justify why they could tell you why if you don't know why you're doing something well that's a whole different conversation but there may have been some motivation some reason for him for choosing this woman but as a result of this he said ahab did more to provoke the lord god of israel to anger than all the kings of israel that were before him so he break the records when it comes to sin and breaking down so we already know this but we we need to touch this because it's important for where we're going first king 17 we are now introduced to the mighty prophet and elijah the tishbite who was of the inhabitants of gilead said unto ahab as the lord god of israel liveth before whom i stand there shall not be due nor rain these years but according to my word and thus we have the first interaction with elijah and we would have mentioned last week that there are five manifestations or five displays or five references to elijah through scripture we have elijah we have elisha we have john the baptist we have william branham and if you read the book of revelation to the jews there's moses and elijah there all right quick reference mount transfiguration there was moses elijah there as well so elijah is very unique in the great mind of god but here is it it is as if to deal with the level of sin that ahab went to god raised up the right kind of man to deal with this particular type of situation everybody with me so elijah we know it he prophesies drought and we know all of this i'm not trying to focus on that tonight we'll have another teaching on that um he challenges ahab in in in chapter 18 we know we have the whole mount carmel showdown we should be familiar with that because by this time jezebel had already begun to influence ahab influence him first from a subtle perspective and and then more and more and more until a king who knew his history who understood what god had done for them for them to be even there allowed jezebel as it were to order the murder of prophets so the holy men the prophets were being killed out on the instruction from this simple woman called jezebel everybody with me on this all right so we have a situation where prophets are under attack so for example 1804 and it was sword i went jezebel cut of the prophet of the lord that obadiah took 100 prophets and hid them so we have all these things beginning to go on here and we know it and then there is this great showdown on mount carmel where elijah fitz is like the last man standing and he said let's call the prophet sabal let's let's see who answered by fire let that god be god so so we understand the situation right and then we have the sound of abundance of rain we're just going through quickly there that's all part of 18. i see a cloud like a man's hand all these references we're aware of it right now i want to now touch 19. so first kings 19. so we kind of berlin into somewhere trying to get to a place so that we can understand it right now i want to briefly or quickly read it so that we could be on the same page with this right and ahab told jezebel all that elijah had done this is first kings 19 and verse one and ahem told jezebel all that elijah had done and with how how he had slain all the prophets with his sword because basically after the whole period with mount carmel and stuff elijah said kill all them false gods all them false prophets put them to the sword all right so then jezebel to see how jezebel is operating then jezebel sent a messenger unto elijah saying so let the gods do to me and more also if i make not thy life as the life of one of them by tomorrow about this time so she's another threat to elijah saying the gods kill me also by tomorrow you were there also just like just like my prophets of belle who you are killed and when he had saw that he arose and went for his life so elijah understanding this ill this jezebel spirit see you here here it is you say i out i out i oh i i i out and came to bear shiva which belonged to judah and left his servant here so elijah say where are you going i named karamazov but he himself went a day's journey into the wilderness and came and sat under juniper tree and he requested for himself that he might die now there's a real position to be you know you just had a mighty mount carmel victory you road the enemy you'll get a threat and we see elijah a mighty man of god prophet of god reached to such a level of depression reach to such a level of exasperation reach to such a level that he feels so low that he requested that he might die now i don't know what you but sometimes you just have some low moments but it is not about having your low moments is the issue is to understand that god comes in the lowest of moments to lift you up when you're feeling low so when somebody tell me they're feeling low i understand i sympathize and anybody who act like they'd have a low moment ready line because you're you're we all have our juniper tree experience to go through and here it was this mighty prophet after a mighty victory to this day we still reference the monk showdown had come to a crossroads in his ministry where he has what what people will call an existential crisis he's wondering why he even exists if he should exist and now which says you know what my whole life falling apart is the best i just did and he's in the midst of that depression that frustration that feeling sorry for himself that wishing you know that that he comes his end and he said it is enough lord oh lord take away my life for i am not better than my father's now his father isn't a real condition you know so he's had to devalue himself to say i just have the bible and fathers who give all them trouble and as he lay there and slept under a juniper tree behold then an angel touched him oh my lord elfquest oh if i inject i'll just touch your shoulder tonight in the midst of your juniper experience in the midst of you wondering what your next move is going to be in the midst of you trying to decide you know how to move how to go how to live an angel come and touch him you see how much god cares for his children he's so much god cares about what you're going through that he would send an angel to touch you so i want you to stay encouraged friends no matter how bad it is there's an angel tonight this is the angel in operation hallelujah to touch you to encourage you to give you a word to say lift your head up and listen listen and he later uh uh uh uh a zlatan stepped under to behold then an angel touch him and said unto him arise and eat in other words pick himself eat something do do something don't do it don't just sit in a pity party and he looked so he's not just arriving and looked and behold there was a cake bacon on the coals and a cruise of water at his head hallelujah injured cake boy and he did eat and drink and lay them down again and the angel of the lord came again the second time and touched him and said arise and eat in other words take seconds when the angel tell it take seconds all right and he did eat and drink and lay down again it says arise and eat because a journey is too great for thee and he arose and did eat and drink and went in the strength of that meat 40 days and 40 nights on the horror the mount of god and i'm reading this because i know we touch later part of this but most people don't take the time and go to this right and he came through onto a cave and lodged there and behold the word of the lord came to him and he said unto him what does thou hear elijah and he said i have been very jealous for the lord god of hosts for the children of israel have forsaken thy covenant thrown down nine altars and slain thy prophets with the sword and i even i only am left and they seek my life to take it away and he said go forth and stand upon the mount before the lord and be all the lord pass by and a great and strong wind ran the mountains and break in pieces of rocks before the lord but the lord was not in the wind and after the wind and earthquake but the lord was not in the earthquake and after the earthquake of fire but the lord was not in the fire and after the fire a still small voice and it was so when elijah heard it and he wrapped his face in his mantle and went out and stood in the entering in of the cave and behold there came a voice unto him and said what does thou hear elijah and he said i've been very jealous for the lord god of hosts because the children of israel had forsaken thy covenant thrown down thine altars and slain thy prophets with the sword and i even i only am left and they seek my life to take it away and this is what i want to get to so in the midst of this despair now god is beginning to deal with the servant and the lord said unto him go return my way to the wilderness of damascus and when thou comest anointed haziel to be king over syria very interesting command and if you search scriptures you will see no situation in scripture where this was actually done by elijah then verse 16 and jehu the son of nimshi shall thou anoint to be king over israel this too elijah did not do and we are going to get gonna get it but to to reach jehu we need to start here because it's the first time his name is mentioned and jehu the son of nimshi shall now anoint to be king over israel and elisha the son of safat abel shaldawa knowing to be prophet in thy room and it shall come to pass that him that escapeth the sword of israel shall jehu slay and him that escaping from the sword of jehu shall elijah slee hallelujah and verse let's just skip down to verse 19. so he departed fence and found elisha the son of shafat who was plowing with 12 yoke of oxen before him and he with the 12th and elisha pass by him and cast his mantle and we know that upon him so i want to paint a picture here before we even advance a little further but there's one more story we need to touch before we get to our text tonight so we have a situation where elijah has his mighty victory god is dealing with elijah he is comforting elijah he also drops some instructions in elijah to elijah we know from our studies of second kings over the last few weeks he talked about neymar we talked about the four lepers we talked about his tsunami woman all these three was the ministry of elisha s-h-a who came after elijah so we find the time where god is telling elijah about elisha but at the same time he is telling elijah about jehu jehu would be a long ways down the road from elijah but god is already thinking about jew coming and what jehu is about to do i want us to catch this for a minute all right everybody with meets tonight all right so and jehu the son of them she shallow anointed to be king over israel so if you just read this as a chronological book then you would say well okay so elijah has this ministry to anoint jehu he has a ministry to go get elisha all right uh uh to be annoying to be prophet and he's here to be king over syria all right so moving on from here now just let me get my notes i have some notes here trying to there's a lot of moving pieces trying to keep track of we now need to jump now to first kings 21. and because what we are doing is stacking up we are going almost because we we will end up rewinding this when we reach further on right so first kings 21 we're going to deal with neboth and it came to pass after these things so a few things would have happened that neighbor the jezreelite had a vineyard which was in jezreel had by the palace of ahab king of samaria so in other words basically right close by ahab property as king of samaria is this man named nebot who is a jezreelite and he has a vineyard now here in is is is how do i say this this is coveting at a whole next level all right and ahab spake unto nearby saying give me thy vineyard that i may have it for a garden of herbs now it does sound like a bad request right because it is near unto my house and i will give thee for it a better vineyard than it or if you know a better vineyard if it seemed good to me i will give you the reward of it and money so in other words ahab catch it one day looking at his property there looking at neighborhood a nice vineyard he said you know what you know i can grow herbs here i can expand my garden it right next to my property if i expand it it's right there it's not like i have to go far never breads here going on let me get your vineyard i want the plant i want to do a crop and where you see it and um i will give you a better vineyard because i'm king so if you want to you want a bigger vineyard you want a banana mountain whatever i can give you that if you don't want the next vineyard i can give any money all right a neighbor said to ahab the lord forbid it to me that i should give the inheritance of my father's unto thee so neighbor respond like listen i wouldn't mind it but hear what is my family property we have it for our whole life i already don't feel comfortable to give you this the lord forbid it that i might give the inheritance to my father's i didn't really work for this i inherited this is my family now when i read this this part just blew my mind and ahab came into his house heavy and displeased because of the word that neighbor the jesuit had spoken to him for he had said i will not give thee the inheritance of my father's and he laid him down upon his bed and turned away his face and would eat no bread you asking somebody for someone that is not yours you ain't work for it it's their family is their family inheritance you give them an offer you offer them a better land you offer them money the man say no and you get so depressed you go on home turn your face in the wall and don't want to eat you seeing how ridiculous this on it but jezebel his wife this jezebel came to him and said unto him why is thy spirit so sad that though he takes no bread and he said unto her this song that's such a flimsy excuse for this situation because i speak on the neighbor the jesuit and said unto him give me that vineyard for money or else if it please ye i will give you another vineyard for it and he answered i will not give thee my vineyard and jezebel his wife said unto him does thou now govern the kingdom of israel arise and eat bread and let thine heart be merry i will give thee the vineyard of neighborhood the jesuit so jesse bell say go on eat relax yourself know your king or what you got in like yourself i will take care of it so she wrote letters in ahab's name and sealed them with his seal and send the letters unto the elders and to the nobles that were in his city dwelling with nebot and she wrote in the letter saying proclaim a fast and set neighbor on high among the people and set two men sons of belial which in the amplified is unprincipled men men of no character men of no reputation who will say anything right and set two men sons of bilia before him to bear witness against him say endow this blaspheme god and the king and then carry him out and stone him that he may die and the man of his city even the elders and the nobles who were the inhabitants in the city did as jezebel had sent unto them and as it was written in the letters which she had sent unto them they proclaimed the fast and set neighbor on high in other words present him before the people and they came in two men children of belial and sat before him and the men of belial witnessed against him even against neighborhood in the presence of the people saying neighbor did blaspheme god and the king then they carried him fought out of the city stoned him with stones that then he died that he died then they sent to jezebel saying nearby the stone and he's dead and it came to pass when jezebel heard that neighborhood was stone and was dead that jezebel said to ahab arise take possession of the vineyard of nebuchad the jezreelite which he refused to give thee for money for neighborhood is not alive but dead and it came to pass when ahab heard that neighborhood was dead that ahab rose up to go down to the vineyard of nearby the jesuit to take possession of it we're still building him then the word of the lord came to elijah the tishbite in other words this got god so upset this action disturbed god so much that he took his prophet and the word of the lord came to elijah the teach by saying arise go down to meet ahab king of israel which is in samaria behold he is in the vineyard of neighbors whether he is gone down to possess it so god tell elijah the exact gps coordinates he tell him who he tell him where he tell him your house right and thou shalt speak unto him saying thus here the lord has doubt killed and also taken possession and thou shalt speak unto him saying thus say the lord in the place where dogs licked the blood of neighborhood shall dogs lick thy blood even thine so now we starting to deal with judgment now and ahab said to elijah has doubt found me oh my enemy you know ahab and elijah never never did well you say has thou found me all my enemy and he answered i have found thee because thou has sold thyself to work evil in the sight of the lord behold i will bring evil upon me and will take away thy posterity and will cut off from ahab him that pisseth against the wall and him that is shut up and left in israel and i will make and will make thine house like the house of jeroboam that was the first king who started the whole idolatry business and i will make that house like the house of jeroboam the son of nebat and like the house of bashar the son of a hajjay and for the provocation where it thou has provoked me to anger and made israel to sin and of jezebel this is the prophecy and of jezebel also speak the lord saying the dog shall eat jezebel by the wall of jezreel him that diet of ahab in the city the dog shall eat and him that diet in the field shall the falls of the air eat but there was none like under ahab which did sell himself to work wickedness in the sight of the lord so that is the lord saying they say god is so disturbed by this and listen how he says whom jezebel his wife stood up so god is saying he have the wickedness but it's jezebel who stirred his wickedness up in his heart you see why brother branham was so hard against the jezebel spirit you see why but i don't care so much too much against it and he did abominably in following idols according to all things as did the amorites whom the lord cast out before the children of israel and it came to pass listen carefully so ab is now hearing this and a ab gets convicted and it came to pass when ab heard those words that he rent his clothes and put sackcloth upon his flesh and fasted and lay in sackcloth and went softly and the word the lord came to elijah the teach by saying cs thou how ahab humbled himself before me because he humbled himself before me i will not bring the evil in his days but in his son's days will i bring the evil upon his house now you see that this kind of scripture here is real serious it's rare serious and it's something i was sharing a while back that you know you whenever you step out of god's will there are consequences there are always consequences because actions have consequences and even if you repent repentance reconciles your relationship with god but your consequence is a whole defense conversation enough so god is the god of his words he said judgment has to come upon ahab and upon jezebel for what they have done i have not forgotten what they have done to my prophets i have not forgotten how they have introduced these false gods i have not forgotten how to build a house for bill and an author for bear i will not forget what they did to nebot a simple man had his property and because ahab lusted after him he and his wife by extension conspired to kill a man to get his property i'm not washing my hands a bit nobody has done as bad as ahab because of this wife of his judgment will come upon him judgment will come up on his house and ab is here in this but yet still in the midst of his judgment he gets convicted begins to fast and pray and god says well all right the jabba will come but i will not bring it in your day it's going to follow you every everybody with me we're building a background here now right okay cool so now let me kind of push to my text time is is kind of running a little bit here so we have been in second kings we're going to go back in second kings now so in second kings by second kings second kings opens up with a lot of things happening we have the intro of second as we have said with elijah being taken up and elisha taking over so now elijah's obviously seen but we see no encounter with elijah and jehu so it would seem as if elijah has gone but this part with elijah anointing jehu has not been fulfilled all right we see also uh uh we see also in in second kings well in in the end of first kings as we transition the second thing we see the death of ahab and we quickly go through all of the miracles we have elisha we have the whole situation with neyman and we went through that we went through the the all of that with the syrian army more force and against us we went through the lepers at the gate we went through the synonymized woman and we would have reached uh chapter eight in our teaching last week with elisha uh come in and give word to the tsunamite and then that woman coming and being restored and getting back the help from the king and seven now we reach chapter nine and this is where we're going to rest our case and our time here to see a very if you ever see action in scripture this is the one of the most action-packed uh it's almost too much action in one so let's let's let's let's start reading so second kings nine and verse one and elisha the prophet called one of the children of the prophets and said unto him so this is like a a junior prophet a servant a assistant this is elijah the prophet called one of the children of the prophet and said unto him good at thy loins and take this box of oil and die in hand and go to ramat gilead so he's commissioning one of these cells in the prophet on a mission he said and when thou come and stood up look out there jehu the son of jehoshaphat the son of nimshi so we see in this instruction of anointing jehu is caught up in the ministry of the spirit of elijah because although elijah has not done it the commission has not ended and the commission cannot end because there is another elijah because the spirit of elijah got rest upon elijah we know this so elijah's not there but the spirit of elijah is there resting upon elijah and elijah picks up the mantle of elijah to continue the ministry the unfinished things that elijah did not finish so elisa picks it up now and what is even almost more mysterious is that elijah is not even doing it himself elijah elijah had the commission on the instruction elisha catches it but he delegates it that's a whole longer conversation all right so he commissions one of his servants and listen how this drama builds out and and and it is interesting the mind of god on this but as you read into this you could almost wonder what god showed elijah what god showed elisha about what was about to happen now bear in mind i want us to understand god is a just god he is a god that gives choices he's a god i say in blessing i will bless thee if you do what i want the blessing i will give you listen your enemy can look at it your couple run over when you're reading scripture that's how god talk talk i will make your enemies my enemies that's how god talks but if you do what you want to do if you follow your own way then judgment will come that's that's how god that all god is and but branham said before there could be judgment there's always warning so every prophet when you read it every prophet was speaking about don't do this change your ways repent repent repent repent but i want us to understand that there comes a time when the ministry switches from mercy to judgment and at this point look what's about to unfold here we're going to speed it up a little bit because this is this is this is the action pattern right and when they'll come and stood up look out there jay who in other words find jay who is son of jehoshaphat the son of nimshi and go in and make him arise up from among his brethren and carry him to an inner chamber in other words pull him outside in that secret room and take the box of oil and pour it on his head and say so you're giving him your words pure instructions say whatever say thus say the lord i have anointed the king over israel now this is a man nowhere on the radar all right king over israel then listen carefully then open the door and flee and carry not lord help me this is one of the fastest anointing er you'll ever see so you tell him go find this man go unknowing this man when you finish annoying him don't run a no flee because when the anointing touch him you don't want to be around this anointing listen this we read in the bible tonight ryan he said when is anointed in other words i said i don't know what will happen when this anointing come upon him because what he anointed for is different so when is the anointing come upon him run for your life flee don't tarry that's amazing right so the young man even the young man the prophet went to rama gilead and when he came behold the captains of the horse was sitting and he said i have an errand to thee or captain and jehu said unto which of all us and he said to d.o captain so it's a room of commanders these are all captains so it is not as if jehu is of is of of the palace i know the royal family and these kind of things is a military war command meeting that is going on everybody with me tonight all right and he arose and went into the house and he poured the oil onto his head and said unto him does say the lord god of israel i have anointed thee king over the people of the lord even unto israel and thou shalt smite the house of ahab thy master that i may avenge the blood of my servants the prophets and the blood of all the servants of the lord at the hand of jezebel for the whole house of ahab shall perish and i will cut off from ahab him that pisseth against the wall and him that is shot up and left in israel we are finding exact language here for might be ready with your own right and i will make the house of ahab like the house of jeroboam the son of nibert and like the house of basha the son of ahijah and the dog shall eat jezebel in the portion of jezreel and there shall be none to bury her and he opened the door and fled so the prophet anoints give the word and he runs for his life then jehu came forth to the servants of the lord and watson once said unto him is all well i mean is everything okay i see somebody play our side is all well wherefore came this mad fellow to thee so these military men seeing these prophets these spiritual men as mad men and he said unto them so jehu's response and he said to them you know the man and his communication in other words you know that man men and them or their stock that is that how we say but it is obvious something going on because if you pour a whole box of oil on my head it is very obvious that i ain't coming back looking the same way i went out so then fellas watching jehu jai who's saying you know all right my mother's talking they say where is mama come and check you and here it is jehu have oil running all over him and they said it is false in other words don't tell us there's no word man man if it's false we know it's false we see an oil on your shoulder oil on your shoe oil in your head your cabin talks oil running over your face it is false tell us now and he said does and does speak he to me saying thus said the lord i have anointed thee king over israel then they hasted quickly and took every man his garment and put it under him on the top of the stairs and blew with trumpet saying je who is king so then men air waste time in assuming their position and accepting jay who was king now bear in mind jehu is king there is a sitting king the king who is sitting in israel is still jehoram or called joram the same name the same one you see him jehoram who was walking and who the lady had said must this lady and i we did we didn't want we didn't agree to eat one son and then she and then we eat my son and she wanted to hide her son this is him jehoram who is still king right so jehu the son of jehoshaphat the son of nimshi conspired against juram now joram had kept rama gilead he and all israel because of israel king of syria so in other words we didn't read it but there was a war there was a battle that took place but king joram was returned to be healed so joram who this is ahab's son you remember we had introduced this that jehoram or juran was ahab's son so aya was his father jezebel is his mother all right the first boy of the first son i think was ahaziyah was ahab son he died of accident and then jehoram became king by default so he was the king really for a while he gets injured so he decides to go to recuperate from his injuries in jezreel jezreel is the same place that ahab had his house before and the same place where neighbor had his vineyard that ahab take over so he is there relaxing trying to recuperate from his battlefields but king joham was returned to be healed in jezreel of the wounds which is syrians had given him when he fought with hazel king of syria remember we talked about the anointing of the israel we didn't touch it but elisha would have had an interaction with his year before right and jail said if it be your minds then let none go forth no escape out of the city to go tell it in jezreel so jehu upon the anointing and your men acknowledging as king tell them don't let nobody leave this city where we are i don't want word to leave that i have been annoying anointed as king so jehu rode in a chariot and this is the part most people remember this this small part of jehu right and jehu wrote in a chariot and went to jezreel for joram levy the king of israel and ahaziah king of judah who would have also been joram's nephew so although the two kingdoms north and south had two kings it was they were actually related by family so a haziah king of judah had come down to see jerome to check upon his fellow king and they stood a watchman on the tower of jezreel and he spy the company of jehu as he came and he said i see a company in other words i see a group of people and joram the king said take a horse and send to meet them and let him say is it peace in other words is everything okay see how they're coming is everything okay so they went one on horseback to meet them one at horse and said just say the king is in peace and jail said what has thou to do with peace turn thee behind me in other words join me and the watchman told saying the messenger came to them but he committed not again in other words we set up a man but here coming back he riding with them too then he sent out a second one on horseback which came to them and said does say the king is it peace and jehu answered what has doubt to do with peace turn thee behind me in other words come right with me also and the watchman told saying he come he came even unto them and cometh not again and the driving wait listen to this is like the driving of jehu the son of nimshi for he drive it furiously so jai who had a reputation of how we drive in chariot what kind of man this is that from a distance the way he moving on the road he said i know that driving you know that looking like jehu all right so this is a man who has a has a reputation he has a way about him he's i don't even know what is what what driving furiously mean right and joram said make ready and his chariot was made ready now bear in mind at this point juram this is one of jerome's generals jehu would have been a commander in joram's army so jorah i'm not thinking that that that jehu coming with no bad agenda he said with this speedy comments there's some kind of music coming to bring so he said make ready and his chariot was made ready and joram king of israel and a hazard king of judah it's one of the few times you see the kings rolling together in this way went out each in his chariot and they went out against jehu and met him in the portion of neighborhood and jesuit and it came to pass when joram saw jehu that he said is it peace jehu and he answered what peace this is jehu's response what peace so long as the whoredoms of thy mother jezebel and her witchcrafts are so many and joram turned his hands and fled and set a hazard as treachery or azaha in other words this thing is not it's not what i thought it was run for your life and jehu drew a bow with his full strength and smote jerome you see how this switchy name there's the same name but now calling my other name and small jerome between his arms and the arrow went out at his heart and he sung dung in his chariot then said jehu to bidka his captain take up and cast him in the portion of the field of neighborhood the jezreelite for remember how that when i and daw rode together after ahab his father the lord laid this burden upon him surely i have seen yesterday the blood of neighborhood and the blood of his son said the lord and i will require thee in this plot said the lord now therefore take and cast him into the plot of ground according to the word of the lord so jehu is anointed and he's quoting back all these scriptures all the prophecies as he's beginning to close back his thread as it were to almost start to undo and bring justice for all that ahab would have wrought but when ahaziah is the king of judah saw this he fled by the way of the garden house and jehu followed after him and said smite him also in the chariot and they did so and they're growing up a girl which is by ibrahim and he fled to megiddo and he died there so in one day both the king of israel and the king of samaria is brutally killed and his servants carried him in a chariot to jerusalem and buried him in his cifalika with his fathers in the city of david jerusalem and in the 11th year of jorah and the son of ahab began as a hazard to reign over judah and when jehu was come to jezreel so jehu is writing he's in a mission all right and we're gonna we're gonna talk about jehu because jehu when you read it deeper you can see jehu end up getting so caught up in judgment he started to do a little too much so it's a it's a big teaching because god give him a specific mandate yes it's a measure of judgment but jehu get a little too much into it so when jay who has come to jezreel listen now jezebel by no jezebel is no longer a young girl jezebel is now a full-grown much older woman jessie bell has heard of it and she's away but i ran away and she painted her face and tied her head and looked out at a window there's a lot i could say there i have quotes in it i don't even get hit tonight and as jehu entered in at the gate she said had zimri peace who sue his master in other words she is quoting a name zimri who was a king who served for only seven days and zimri had done the same thing because zimi was also a commander who had killed the king and killed the family so she had perception and understanding of the missionary who was on and he lifted up his face to the window and said who is on my side who and there looked out to him two or three eunuchs and he said throw her down and they threw her down and some of her blood was sprinkled on the wall and on the horses and he trued her under foot so this started to get to get a little dicey here now because when you read this to see this is a lot to process i have to say this if you've never read this before a lot to process and when he had come in he did eat and drink so this is a special kind of anointing there's a special kind of man who could ride up to the palace kill one king killing the king tell them throw jezebel off the wall see then he run his horses over her and then he come in and say and i'll have anything to to eat but i have any food and when he come in he did eat and drink and said go see now this cursed woman and bury her for she's a king's daughter and they went to bury her but they found no more of her than the skull and the feet and the palms of her hands and wherefore they came again and told him and he said this is the word of the lord which he spake by his servant elijah the tishbite saying in the portion of jezreel shall dogs eat the flesh of jezebel and the carcass of jezebel shall be as dung upon the face of the field in the portion of jezreel so that they shall not say this is jezebel you know in other words god was so disturbed by what jezebel and he have done that this word about jesus was so profound that jehovah's anointing gave him a special i don't even know what the world uses that this was this wasn't facing him he wasn't warring up he he knew what his mission was this was just pure judgment but it doesn't stop there and ahab had 70 sons in samaria this would have extended to a family so it's not like direct direct food sons his family and jehu wrote letters and sent to samaria unto the rulers of jesus to the elders and to them that brought up ahab's children seeing so like the guardians now as soon as this letter coming to you seeing your masters sons are with you and there they are with you chariots and horses offense city auto and armor look even out the best and the fittest the meatiest is the fittest of your master's sons and set him on his father's throne and fight for your master's house in other words jay who is saying are coming pick your best fighters pick whichever son is the best one make him king because they're coming to the strikings but they were exceedingly afraid and said behold two kings shall not be before him oh then shall we stand so they're saying if jehoram didn't even withstand you and they were sitting kings how we go pick one of these sons to be king and withstand you and he said that was over the house and and he that was over the house and he that was over the city and the elders also and the bringers up of the children sent to jehu saying we are thy servants and will do all that thou shalt bid us we will not make any king do that which is good in thine eyes then you wrote a letter the second time today i'm saying if you be mine and if you will hearken unto my voice take ye the heads of the men your master sons and come to meet the jezreel by tomorrow this time now the king's sons being 70 persons were with the great men of the city which brought them up and it came to pass when the letter came to them that they took the king's sons and slew 70 persons and put their heads in baskets and sent him them to jezreel and there came a messenger and told him saying they have brought the heads of the king's sons and he said lay ye them in two heaps at the entering of the gate until the morning so in other words 35 heads on one side 35 heads on one side all right now this sounds rough this song's gruesome but the reality is i want us to understand because we read the message we read the scripture and at times we don't process judgment we don't process how god could say slay the amalekites say the amorites i know god can say i give you mercy i bless you take my way but if you don't take my way then god is a judgment we know this world is heading for judgment we know judgment is hanging and we say germans hanging over the world this here in in all of what we have read to in kings to lead up to this point we're actually seeing what the hand of judgment looks like i wanted to see this now is nothing light this is not there is nothing get you scared either but it's you to understand how god operates we need to understand that god is the god of his word and if god is the god of his word and he said the day you eat up this street that day you die that is his word he has to honor that word i want us to understand that when god say don't be unequally yoked when but branham would silly prophetically under no circumstances should a believer marry an unbeliever those are big statements those are powerful statements they have had a choice his choice led to him bringing a woman into his house and by virtue of bringing her into the house brought her into the kingdom in bringing her into the kingdom he end up building a house for bill a altar for bill initiate priests for bill end up he didn't start that way he was bad already but she brought it worse and it's not the issue of how bringing it worse the point is it brought idolatry and god's imma jealous god in him so god here was not this is not about people now this is about spirits we're talking about here so i don't want to see it as as as people i want to understand it was a spirit and the spirit of realism and idolatry that had entered into the people that god was nowhere in the picture hear the cry of elijah we read before where he said look how thy people have thrown down everything they knew and i even i only i'm the one who's left and it was so discouraging to elijah but he said you know what take my life to now because i feel like i can't even fight what is going on it is so bad and god is saying i will not let that exist like that i will have to bring judgment because they have also killed my prophets so i want us as we go through this to understand that as we read this god you think god will allow all the prophets who have gone before this message dripping in blood so let it reach a point that he will not take action that god will allow his kingdom allow his name allow people to do what they want and he will sit back forever and do nothing i want us to see the connection friends with how long he took to even act between the time of the word of anointing jehu because god knew how bad it would get and he knew just as elijah had to raise up to deal with ahab he knew he would have to raise up a jehu at some point in time to deal with it whether you called jehu gruesome brutal fought anointed it didn't matter what you call him he was still in the plan of god because god raised them up and told elijah anoint him elisha picked it up he has to be anointed he sent a servant to anoint him maybe they didn't want their hands to touch what he had to do because they understood the ministry that he and the role he had to play but his path was important because god said i will bring judgment for what you have done to my word what you have done to my people so it's a challenge on leadership because ahab by being a leader was in a position to influence the people who were following so he had to take the responsibility and the price of leadership because his decision to marry jezebel and to allow her to slowly take more and more and more and more until he has king she tell him go and eat i'll handle it and she orchestrates the murder of a farmer you think god is interested in the very simple things in life about what happens to his children god said what happened with the neighborhood there's consequences of that the same field the same way neighbor died that will repeat again and here it is you say a whole line will be destroyed and here we see a man anointed almost as it were with without remorse without emotion without feeling jezebel did he gonna eat food normal normal and when he finished it he explained to them i am fulfilling scripture look you would let's go on chapter 10 verse 8 and there came a messenger and told him saying they have brought the heads of the king's sons he said lay them in two heaps at the entering in of the gate until the morning so 35 heads on one side 35 heads on the next side and leave it there overnight so the people seeing this and i have a big point to make it in in in a while and it came to pass in the morning that he went out and stood and said to all the people ye be righteous behold i conspired against my master and slew him but who slew all these so jay would say listen i killed the two kings but who killed these because he sent a letter but it was their guardians and it was their people who killed the sons right know now that they shall fall upon the earth nothing of the word of the lord which the lord spake concerning the house of ahab for the lord had done that which he speak by his servant elijah now i want to bring this point friends we have made it clear the spirit of elijah came upon elisha the same ministry of elijah was upon john the baptist he said ministry of elijah was upon william brown on the prophet i want us to understand when people go and make statements against this prophet it is a serious serious serious dangerous game because not one word will come to the ground even if you don't understand it because i wanted to understand how god operates somebody could look at elijah and say but god tell them to anoint jehu that didn't happen look how long it take to happen when god speaks a word it goes beyond time it goes beyond our understanding once god lets the word out it is alternate and he can't even take it back so even when he pronounced judgment and they have all he have fasting and stuff didn't change the job done on his house he didn't say you might not see it do it the way you call the city or the player god can let them live and see all of it all right so no now and i want us to catch his friends knowing now that they shall fall upon the earth nothing of the word of the lord which the lord spake concerning the house of ahab for the lord had done that which he spoke by his silver and elijah so and it goes on so jehu slew all that remained of the house of ahab in jezreel and all his great men and his skins folks and his priests and he left none remaining what about total total and he arose and he definitely and he parted and came to samaria so you go into the capital and as he was at the sharing house in the way jehu met with the brethren so he on his way he met with the brethren of ahaziah king of judah now bear in mind judah is a different kingdom from israel so he met with the bridges of ahaza king of judah and he said who are you and they answered we are the brethren of ahazayah and we are we go down to saludi chiron of the king and he turned up the queen and he said take them alive and they took them alive and sued them at the pit of the sharing house even 2 and 40 men 42 neither lefty any of them and when he was departed dance he lighted on jehonadab the son of richard and you will actually find johanna the son of richard mentioned in jeremiah there's a passage of scripture which speaks of a group a family a group of people who said we have maintained the law we will not drink wine we will not do anything because since our father jehorada the son of rachel so this man he met is a spiritual man he is one of the true one of the remaining faithful coming to meet him and he saluted him and said to him is thine heart right as my heart is with thy heart and yohunadam answered it is if it be give me thy hand and he took him and he gave him his hand and he took him up into the chariot and he said come with me and see my zeal for the lord so jehu is calling this also the zeal of the lord so they made him to ride in his chariot and he came to sumeria he slew all that remained unto ahab in samaria till he had destroyed him according to the saying of the lord which he speak to elijah and elijah and jehu gathered all the people together and said unto them ahab served baal a little but jehu will serve him much so understand this he attacked jezreel first so those in samaria they don't know what's going on word he is moving so quickly those who knew he was anointed king they haven't left where they at he is riding furiously so he's breaking his speed limit he raised down to jezreel wipe out the king wipe out jezebel wipe out everybody there he writes other areas destroy the family now he's heading down into into samaria and he makes as if he is a baal worshiper also i want you to catch this so jehu guided all the people together and said unto them ahab serve bail a little in other words if ahab was a bear worshipper it was a little bit he already wasn't a true bl worshipper i am a real male worshipper and what do they care just say so he said ahab served bail a little but jail shall serve him much he said no therefore call unto me all the prophets of bill all his servants and all his priests let none be wanting in other words don't leave anybody out we're going to make the biggest sacrifice the bear we ever make before for i have a great sacrifice to do to bear whosoever shall be wanting he shall not live in other words we're going to do this sacrifice massive if you miss it and you're a bear worshiper i will kill you so jay was saying if we're going to do this worship let's do it for real but jehu did it in certainty to the intent that he might destroy the worshippers avail and jay who said proclaim a solemn assembly for baal and they proclaimed it and jehu sent through all israel so this is it's clean in time this is this is not in the amorites or the philistines this is in israel central all israel all the worshippers of baal kim so that there was not a man left that came not so jehu i understand this by calling for bail worship all them backslidden israelites will bail worship i'll say well i should be able to you know i worship until the bible say everybody who worship me will come out right so that there was not a man left that came and they came into the house of vale and the house of bill was full from one end to another you imagine he cited this this is in israel now and he said unto him that was over the vestry over the area bring forth vestments all the clothes for all the worshipers of real and he brought them for investments and jehu went to and jehonadab the son of richard into the house of bill and said unto the worshippers of baal search and look that there be here with you none of the servants of the lord but the worshipers of baal only so now they're looking at one another yeah i know him he does party with me yeah he does party with me too yeah yeah we just this is all i'm not this is making sure that the only true bell worshippers are there and when they went in to offer sacrifice and burnt offerings jehu appointed four scorers 80 men outside and said if any of the men who i have brought into your hands escape he had let him go his life shall be for the life of him so jai who have all the worshippers in one house put solace around the building and tell him if one of them people escape i kill him you feel like escape jehu ministry is different this is not a ministry you can't aspire for this ministry and it came to pass as soon as he had made an end of offering the burnt offering that jay who said to the god and the captain go in and slay them left non-comfort and they smote them with the edge of the sword and the guard and the captains cast them out and went to the city of the house of bill and they brought forth the images out of the house of bill and burn them and they break down the image of bill and broke down the house of bill and made it a draft house onto this day a draft house like a cesspit that's what that that that's what the old text is does jehu destroyed bell out of israel i'm gonna try to kind of tie some of this together but i want you to notice this now so god is sovereign in how he operates and we see here that this is accomplished and it's a great teaching because on the one hand we see god will keep his word his word was for doing this to my prophets for doing this to my people judgment will come your worship are false gods it was a commandment doubt shall have no other god before me so this should come as a no surprise to us how this plays out in a certain sense but i want to now go now at the character of jehu a little bit so we just read thus jehu destroyed baal out of israel howbeit from the sins of jeroboam the son of nabat who made israel to sin jail who departed not from after them to with the golden calves that were in better and that were in dan listen carefully so jehu is anointed jehu is inspired he goes and destroys all the idols of veil but he still has some idols in his heart that's what the bible is saying here the golan calves from bethel and from then and the lord said unto jehu because that has done well in executing that which is right in my eyes and has done unto the house of ahab according to all that was in my heart thy children of the fourth generation shall sit on the children of israel so after jehu's great-grandchildren would have been kings because of clearing out bail from israel but jehovah verse 31 took no heed to walk in the law of the lord god of israel with all his heart for he departed not from the sins of jeroboam which made israel to sin so baal had been removed but there were still sins that were hidden in in jehu from jeroboam that he had not removed and the bible said in verse 32 in those days the lord began to cut israel short and hazel smote them in all the coasts of israel so i want us to understand this so that even though jihu obeyed the word of the lord by successfully coming against the type of idol worship that was built he did not give up the idols that he treasured so the law rewarded him for his good action second kings tentative but he had to pay his own price second kings 10 32 shows it of the cutting of israel short by israel because he was also unwilling to give up his personal idols and if you read hosea in the book of hosea the lord and speaking to hosea when jose had a son he said the lord will call his name jezreel for yet a little while and i will avenge the blood of jezreel upon the house of jehu and will cause to cease the kingdom of the house of israel so god used jehu for a purpose jehu was anointed but understand his friends the anointing is still separate from you listening to god's word his instruction and living our life so that that's why there are many people who are anointed and they have an anointing with them for whatever it is but they still have to check what is in their hearts so i don't want you to ever operate with well i i i cut this out and i cut this out you know ultimately what god is looking for here is is the scripture of walking in the law of the lord with all of your heart it was there are so many lessons in this we don't have time to go through all of them tonight but this is just another piece of the puzzle so to speak because god has it here for a reason for some who are being introduced this for the first time well there will be a lot to come out of this for those who are familiar with this i hope this begins to close some pieces for you so you begin to understand a few things one is god started this prophecy about jehu way back before elisha was even commissioned because the commission of elisha and the commission of jehu was coming at the same time so god knew he would need a jehu to deal with what ahab and they did god was pleased with part of what jehu did and because of it down to his grand his great-grandchildren were kings only throne but within jehu's heart issues that he himself didn't overcome and his zeal of the lord was in part it was right but it was it was also convenient because he didn't go after everything else he didn't extend his zeal to go after his own idols so i want to kind of close it with this there are many people who take one aspect of the word or one aspect because here it is jehu i'm balancing it now jehu was quote in quotes elijah said this is why i did that elijah said this is why i did that elijah said this is why i did that and he's absolutely right in taking the quotes and placing it there and god using him to fulfill that well that was his portion but somehow jehu missed all of the scriptures all of the quotes all of the words that dealt with him having his own idols i want to encourage us tonight to not be convenient with how we approach you would i want to challenge us tonight that we can't take the part of the world that we want to go to town with and press people with we have to take all of the word we have to take everything and walk with this in all of our hearts at all times way to straighten up the key lesson here is about removing idols because god ends this by saying he did not stop the golden calves so the real lesson here was not about bail it was about the idol bill it was about the golden cup it was about idols or anything else that taken the place of where god is supposed to be because at the end of the day his decisions to not deal with the sins of jeroboam and have the golden calves from dan and better that were in that and better dealt with men there were still idols and later on it would lead them into captivity so jehu went with his zeal but he didn't go all the way he went overboard it would seem in one direction because there were certain elements of the instruction that he kind of really went with a bit he did what he was supposed to do and then and god said he carried right in my eyes and has done into the house of ap according to all that was in my heart and he gave him a blessing because of that but what god wants is a total cleaning of our lives a total cleaning of our hearts it was easy for jehu to see what other people was doing but at the same time we have to admit because god draws it to our attention he would have been king for 28 years after he wiped out the bill he sat as king for 28 years the lord blessed him for his role and for what he did in because baal was just horrible killing the prophet was horrible so god dealt with that but god still wasn't pleased so i want to nail down that you cannot settle for just the blessing of doing part of it i wanted to see above this story to see that god really wants 100 of our hearts he picks man with a certain character a certain nature so when he wanted the new testament he found paul paul was an academic paul was a as a writer paul was a man who was studied under gamaliel so he found a man to write and he found a man to bring things up when he wanted to do this particular thing he found a man named jehu a man a commander a war man who would have no issues doing this and the anointing that was upon him clearly the prophets understood it you tell him listen run for your life when you put it wrong for your life because i don't know who you're gonna kill because that's his ministry that's what he's called to do but friends no matter the ministry or the calling or the anointing in this season we have to do because god is not in jehu took no heed that no heed meaning that he was given the cues you know i wanted to catch that he was given i'm trying to close you know he was given the cues the heed he was given the the the the nudge to go all the way but he went as far as he wanted to go anybody with me tonight he went as far as he wanted to go i just want to read one one thing here is is he amplified took no care took no heed so he wasn't careful about it he didn't try to to go deeper than his his his anti-bail thing so friends i trust tonight was a bit more of a teaching or more of a of exploring another aspect of this journey in second kings and i pray that it will encourage you but a browner would have referenced many aspects of this in particular he would have struck this jezebel spirit because all of this ramp up in bail worship came from jezebel so let us bow our heads a word of prayer tonight as we approach the throne of grace and before we pray i want to challenge you tonight don't have an idol but i branham said you can make anything are good you can make anything idol you can make sports your idol you can make your car idol you can make a man a woman your idol you can make your job your idol you could make alcohol your idol you can make anything of god because god is an object of worship this teaching tonight is to check your heart because your idols will lead to destruction i want to challenge you church in this season some people make watching news more important than anything else in the world they worship the news they worship the report they worship politics they worship all kinds of things anything that takes you away from god's business is an idol i want us to cast down idols tonight and i want us to find back the balance to not just last out at the things that easy to point at bill what should be what's your bill worship deal worship it is easy many people say he doing wrong he did it wrong he did it wrong and behind these scenes they have their own issues that i don't want anybody to know about and god is saying every idol has got to go shall we pray heavenly father lord we come tonight lord to look at this jehu who went from a soldier to a king that was prophesied lord even before elisha who was the prophet of the time was was in place you spoke to elijah about him elisha picked it up lord because you saw how it will all unfold and how idol worship would start subtly with this marriage between ahab and jezebel and it will grow and grow and grow lord until prophets would be killed lord the bible goes on to say that lord the sacred places law where people worship you were destroyed and under and the priests under and and and and the prophets lord were hunted and destroyed lord with with infiltrates in israel as it will lord and so too we see lord the attack against your people and the subtle idols lord idols on on social media we see idols on the television we see idols in movies we see idols in the workplace we see the idol of money we see different kinds of idols lord our people worship not even realizing that they have displaced your place in their hearts lord and to see how you would raise up lord and anoint jehu to move through to bring and begin to push back restoration and to begin to deal law with judgment for what was done we know judgment is hanging over your people it was elijah in that day elisha in that day and we too have had elijah in our day and we know judgment is over your people lord but we want to lord cover your people tonight lord with a a spirit of repentance lord to clean out our lives before judgment because judgment is coming judgment is set it's already set it's already in motion it's already spoken further but we want to take time where there's still a space of grace a space of grace to correct the things that need to be corrected a space of grace to look into the word and to make sure we do all that we could do lord to change our walk to change our talk to change our life to lord to put you first to put the priority on your word to put the priority on worshiping you so may you help your children tonight lord i made this scripture lord lord be edifying to your people may you open the understanding to that you are real and that every word you spoke will come to pass may you bless your people in a special way tonight in the precious name of jesus christ amen and amen and amen may the lord richly bless you service continues tomorrow night uh at uh 8pm livestream service and of course friday night our prayer meeting may the lord richly bless you tonight thank you for being a wonderful audience god richly bless you
