appreciate you i've taken the time off to be here we really appreciate the testimonies of friday we appreciate the service on sunday and what a service we had on sunday praise the name of the lord how many appreciate this ever since sunday blessed be the name of the lord final warning do not cross the line and you know it's really powerful the quote from brother branham seeing young people at the old tennessee it was too late they cross the line but our eyes are plotted by the word lines are to define a defined marketion uh aligned to define where you're supposed to be and where you're not supposed to be we're not supposed to cross so so friends i trust then that you realize that is not man speaking as god speaking god is speaking by his word and if we take that word our hearts will be blessed and benefited tonight i have something up on my heart i i um i really let's see how it goes i would see what the lord will say philippians chapter 2 we want to look at that scripture tonight phillips chapter 2 and you want to read from verse 3 to 11 you want to start up with philippians chapter 2 you have your bibles have your bibles ready we infer feast tonight and the word philippians chapter 2 reading from verse 3. it says let nothing be done to strive for vain glory but in lowliness of mind let each esteem the other better than themselves look not every man on his own things but every man also on the things of others let this mind be in you which was also in christ jesus who being in the form of god taught it not a robbery to be equal with god so that established the level where he was at form of god no robbery to be equipped with god but who said made himself of no reputation that is what other people think about you it's not about a character now so many have no reputation and took upon him the form of a silver and was made in the likeness of men and being found in fashion as a man there we go he humbled himself and became obedient humbled himself and became obedient unto death even the death of the cross before god at all highly exalted him give him a name which is above every name that at the name of jesus every knee should bow of things in heaven things in earth things under the earth and that every tongue should confess that jesus christ is lord to the glory of god tonight the title i have tonight is submit submission surrender a biblical perspective three s words submit submission surrender from a biblical perspective let's look at the meaning of these words submit a verb it says to accept or yield to a superior force or to the authority or will of another person to yield a governance or authority to defer or to consent to abide by the opinion or authority of another not a meaning to yield oneself to the authority or will of another surrender the meaning of submission submissions are known it says the action of accepting or yielding to a superior force or to the will or authority of another person next the condition of being submissive humble or compliant third an act of submitting to the authority or control of another and for surrender verb it has here stop resisting to an enemy or opponent and submit to the authority to to yield to the power control or possession of another upon compulsion or demand three to give oneself up into the power of another especially as a prison now i read these things as a backdrop to where we want to go and what we want to share tonight and if you have your bibles that's continues to james 4 you want to read from verse from james 4. this is an important one and we will see what the lord say to us through this scripture and james chapter four verse one from whence come wars and fighters among you comedy not hence even of your lust that war in your members he lust and have not you kill and desire to have and cannot obtain a fight and war yet you have not because you ask that and you ask and receive not why because your acts are missed that you may consume it upon your lust he adulterers and adulteresses knowing not that the friendship of the world is enmity with god whosoever therefore will be a friend of the world is the enemy of god now this scripture here is powerful whosoever therefore will be a friend of the world is the enemy of god do you think that the scripture certain vein the spirit that dwelleth in us lusted to envy but he gave it more grace wherefore he see it god resisted the proud but gave it grace unto the humble and this is the verse you want to get here to submit yourselves therefore to god resist the devil and he will flee from you note it didn't say resist the devil he shall flee it start off with submit yourselves therefore to god so in submission to god the power to resist the devil will be activated and he will free from you eight draw knight a god he will draw nigh to you cleanse your hands he sinners and purify your hearts he double-minded be afflicted and mourn weep let your laughter be turned into mourning and your joy to heaviness humble yourselves in the sight of the lord and they shall lift you up now if you notice the first scripture we read the jesus humbled himself and became obedient we also know that jesus learned obedience now we are not born with humility we are not born with obedience we are not born being submissive and willing that is not how we are born we are born in sin and shape iniquity and having a spirit of rebellion a rebellion against god a rebellion against its principles now what submission is now many believers and christians and i say this way have a false idea of what submission means in the bible it is interpreted as taken away by liberty oppression and especially in regards to paul's teaching on wives submit to your own husband this scripture has been taken as a recipe for mistreating and abusing wise but paul clearly states husbands love your wives as christ loved the church and give himself for it further he said this is a great mystery but i speak on christ and the church so the real context of submission has to do first with really christ and the church so clearly real submission is based on love the husband submits to christ reflecting or acting out christ's love for the church in return the wife willingly surrenders to her husband and this biblical submission brings about the correct relationship between husbands and wife and christ and the church doesn't bring the wife afraid of her husband it doesn't make the wife cannot say anything to her husband because their husband make us zip up and put tape on her mouth she cannot be and will not be an effective help meet for him and that is the rule of a wise there was no meat help for him and in that role now i don't just want you to see relationship i want you to see also the context of christ and the church so it's not that a woman under oppression and you want me to do this and you want me to do that and no it's not about that it's about the love being extended and you surrender into that love it's not about abuse it's not that at all so we want to go a little deeper and i trust that this would help all of us here tonight okay now christ was submissive to the father this is where this come from so it's not a matter of a teaching that was not expressed by jesus himself but he was submissive to the father we know the scriptures i always do that which pleases my father he humbled himself and become obedient therefore from a natural position then we could say if you cannot submit to your husband how can you submit to god i want you to think about that now if you cannot submit to your husband how can you submit to god now if the husband cannot submit to christ how do you want your wife to submit to you because your life as a husband should be a submissive life to god and to christ that she could see your willingness your interests your leading to want god's will for your life so therefore jesus even though he was god even though he taught enough robbery to be equal of god watch the form he took him he took on the form of a servant to accomplish god's will and purpose facing death his words were not my will but dying be done now this thing about submission as i said we're not born with it we're not gifted with it we are not graced with it romans 8 and this scripture from romans 8 1 says there is therefore no no condemnation to them that are in christ jesus who was not after the flesh but after the spirit okay now i'm reading the scripture because i want to identify that jesus walk on this earth pleasing the father his job is objective this is where submission gets its roots if i could see it that way submission gets its roots or part of the roots of submission have to do with pleasing the father or pleasing god what pleases him and the bible says that the for day this is verse 5 that are after the flesh do mind the things of the flesh but deed after the spirit the things of the spirit four here we go to be carnally minded is death but to be spiritually minded is life and peace because why why the carnal mind is enmity against god obeying mind this is the mind we born with we've been born spiritual it's a carnal mind so this mind that we have it was enmity against god that is why god gave the offer a new heart i will give you give us an exchange i'll take your whole heart out i'll give you a new spirit okay he's extend the order deeper than that and then i'll put my spirit so he gave us a three-step offer for change and transformation and the reason that the carnal mind is enmity against god for it is not subject to the law of god now we know that god brought israel out and because they don't know him they know the prophecy the prophecy was about of a deliverer coming and because they are the texts and the words and from generation to generation all of them had this great hope of this deliverer of course it took 400 plus years and moses came on the scene and when they saw the power they know his god they saw flies fleas and then they were finally getting out of there now the object of bringing the people out wasn't just to bring them out it was to bring them out to bring them to the mountain that they could get god's laws they could get god's mind what god thinks and fears now this these are humans just like us have their own thoughts and ideas and feelings so when moses went up on the fine he was staying alone they said we don't need a man dead make us a god pull iran get earrings and gold and whatnot they end up with a gold that can't and moses come down with two commandments the ten commandments rather do two tablets of stone and see that we know it see it they were somewhere destroyed and so on the people even though they saw supernatural even though they know is god almighty that brought them out yet they were steeped in their carnal nature because the spirit wasn't released yet to even transform on transform them or change them the law was a school master because the law was trying to bring them in subjection to commands and order and regulation thou shalt not steal so shall not lie those times don't commit adultery we remember that sabati but holy you know it was orders it was commands don't do don't do do do and man was still doing so we find them that man feel of course man couldn't keep his side of the bargain and that's why grace produced jesus christ so therefore the carnal mind is enmity against god for it is not subject to the law of god neither in it can be so here the bomb verse 8 so then they that are in the flesh cannot please god how many understand that tonight that the object of the gospel is to get you out of your flesh and to get you in your spirit into the spirit that you could please go and to please god you have to have faith faith is what pleases god so therefore trying to clubber a young person or beat up somebody with the letter of the law under legalism that can't really deliver them they could straighten up and say left right and right turn and left and do a little thing for a while but really that law is not the outside what god wants is the inner law that operates in the heart and this is where this training come because the heart that we you know the bible there's a scripture the heart is deceitfully wicked and evil who can know but god the heart is deceitful wicked who could know it but god so so so that is why we have to come now and hear the word and receive the word and have a desire in our heart for that word to become flesh and for that word to come alive in and through us well let's go again so then they that are in the flesh cannot please god but you are not in the flesh but in the spirit if so be that the spirit of god dwell in you now that same thing in the amplified says verse 7 that is because the mind of the flesh with its carnal torts and purposes is hostile to god for it does not submit itself to god's law indeed it cannot so i want you to see it now the fleshly khanna natural believer christian church member they just in the natural they see things on my natural standpoint they're in their flesh they're not in the spirit they're not even seeing the working of the enemy stripping them of faith of strength of power not even seeing their strength is leaving going they're dying he said but so then those who are living the life of the flesh catering to the appetites and impulses of their carnal nature cannot please or satisfy god or be acceptable to him but you are not living the life of the flesh you are living the life of the spirit if the holy spirit really dwells in you erects and control you now this is interesting tonight because this is not talking about rome about los angeles about america about the press and about every external thing this is dealing with us this is dealing with you and i this is delivered it cannot mind the inner man so this is where you come among the brass because you know you have people uh they like to talk about others you know if you meet them they talk about this one down on that one but they will not talk about themselves they wouldn't talk about what they're going through you see what is talk about any topic they talk about some people they don't even have the humility to say i don't know they won't don't have the humility to say to ask a question if they don't know they wouldn't even ask a question i remember isaac or gideon and some maths class musical some must listen and the teacher asks any questions and nobody asks any questions any teacher told them there's small shame and diction he says small shame is when you don't ask a question you're ashamed that's a question big shame is when you fail the exam because you don't understand your work so it's better you take small shame and take big you got the exam coming so the thing of it is having that humility means that you could say i don't know i really don't know i can't answer that i don't know and you want to know so you want to ask you want to find out because you want to be sure and we're going to get down into it so i trust tonight that uh if you're being blessed that is speaking to you okay now brother branham was saying this here abram didn't stagger and he's talking about i think he was like another prayer line he said the lady here might say how am i going to walk maybe you've been crippled a long time i don't know maybe someone will say well the doctor told me i couldn't live by the brain and i'm going to die that's not what we are talking about that's the natural thing if you look at any of that you will never live but you have got to look to a promise that god made and that promise see the inside of you this outside is sin did you know that you know your body is sin and that's the reason don't try to perfect that body it is sin did you know that it was born in sin shape and iniquity common word speaking lies and that soul is the same way until that soul died and then was born again then that soul and black died the soul that sinner shall die but he that believeth me has everlasting life then there's an immortal life living in that body now that's a stream coming from him like a core on the inside of a man that's the part that's godly that operates this body so here what i want to get to tonight but before this body can ever become perfected the spirit will bring it in submission to god to make you go give the lord a praise offering tonight give the lord a hand the priest tonight before this body can ever become perfected the spirit will bring it in subjection to god to make you it's a war all the time a constant paul said we will never get more than he he said when i would do good evil is near me that's a constant war the flesh against the spirit and here you go look into the flesh the doctor said and you can't serve god you've got to throw aside your senses and god never gave you those senses to trust him with but give you his spirit to trust him your sense is only to contact see taste feel smell and hear but to you yourself is that spirit that lives in you and when that's regenerated the old man died and a new man is born again that is the path of god then you become a son of god an offspring of the creator notice abraham he was happy about that of course about the next quote and then he went out from there and come there was a strike between lots of its men and so forth i want to show you just a little thing here on the comment of the lord just while we're here tonight i'll try not to be too late he said but what's here now just abraham was an ear to the world lot was a type of lukewarm believer he was a believer he had left his homeland it's a journey with god but always never fully surrendered and that's what the trouble in the full gospel church tonight along with the rest of them these people who left the world keep out of the world they don't want to go gambling and drinking and carrying on be a believer but i've never made a complete surrender i want you to think about that people come out of baptist methodist catholic pentecostal hindu muslim they come and believe the message but not surrendered they believe by the brown they believe the books the believers don't say the lord but not surrender are we getting anywhere tonight are you catching what we are saying tonight that this is not going to church this is not our doctrine is right and my doctrine is right or my church this is not that now this is honing in to the individuals are you surrendered and to surrender you have to surrender to an authority you can't just surrender you're surrendering to god you're surrendering to a higher power you surrender into a higher authority that would surrender or submitted or being submissive that is what that is all about let's continue and submitting means putting others before yourself and you read that in the scripture don't think about your own things think about the things of others submitting means not always doing what you want to do it means putting the will of god above your own will sometimes people don't want to ask god because they don't want god tell them no how do you think about that one they don't want to ask god about an issue a problem a deal something they want to do because they want to do it so they wouldn't ask god should i because deep down they they believed they would get new so instead of talking to god about it they go ahead and do it and then when it backfire is oh god but you should say oh god up front you should have asked him first you should have put him first and then it was going to be altogether different i remember when we built a little wooden church in kaiwal and we were looking to expand it about 12 people and you know people that would come and we were looking to expand we were digging the mud and it was a wooden building among some cocoa trees and after we were digging rain fell and all what we dig the mud came and covered back up and when i saw that i said you know what stop stop no further no further because this just not right we labor to dig the mud to expand and all the rainfall because on a flat there's a hill to the side and the mud came down and covered all the labor that we did i said no no this is not it i don't believe this is the will of god must have continued doing this and by the next service the lord spoke to me and told me that we've been sani granting that's where we are now and um one brother told me well after a while nobody believed that as it doesn't matter if nobody believed that i say if god spoke it then it will materialize but what i want to try to assure you is this what if i didn't have the sensitivity to understand that that is not god's program we had a desire to expand it we had a desire to do it but that was not god's plan god wanted us out of there and even if we had the desire and we were doing it he made an interruption because he allowed the interruption to say paul stop no fail and this is where we have to understand when we get a pause or check or go say no not that door no not that road no not that job not that way and that gave us a check and he gave us a check to protect us to help us to bless us what if i had took the approach the devil fight him i'll fight him back and i'm going back to dig some more mud you see what we're gonna talk about so in yielding in surrendering we get the flow of the spirit to know what the will of the lord is amen so i trust tonight that this would help some of you there tonight now submittant authorities is what i have here this is a very interesting scripture because you know we spoke past bible study about faithful and little faithful and much and people behaving attitude is consistent if somebody lazy at home they release the intuition lazy in school is he in a job lazy laziness the diligent diligence is across the board you notice um you could pretend so much and no more your true operation would soon come out and if people fighting authorities then they're going to fight authorities on the job bosses politician government you can fight in church they will fight all about because them is like a talk i mean anti-authority warrior i i will call fighting authority but listen to the scriptures listen to what peter and romans paul say in romans 13 1-5 and i want you to find out romans 13 let's read verse 1 to 5. it said let every soul be subject unto the higher powers now this here he's not talking to unbelievers he's talking here to christians all right for there is no power but of god the powers that they are ordained of god whosoever therefore resisted the power resisted the ordinance of god and they that resist shall receive to themselves damnation for rulers are not terror to good works but the evil will thou then not be afraid of the power do that which is good and though shall have the praise of the same for he is the minister of god to thee for good but if thou do that which is evil be afraid for he beareth not the sword in vain for he's the minister of god a revenger to execute right upon him that do it evil and this is a recap of it here wherefore you must needs be subject not only for right but also for conscience sake now that's a powerful scripture let's examine it in the amplified it says let every person be loyally subject to the governing civil authorities for there is no authority except from god by his permission his sanction and those that exist to do so by god's appointment now a government or president or prime minister could be oppressive but that does not mean what they are saying is sinful if the government wants us to sin that's a different thing altogether it's not the case of like all have to bow down to this idol and shadrach meshach and abednego deliver us we don't have that yet i want to see we don't have that yet there is nothing to suggest that scripture is applicable to lords governing us governing the world because god put judges note my words god put judges magistrate civil government to protect us to protect people that want to do good because of evil people understand this keen children still running the utm they still have daniel we don't talk about that much we don't talk about the seed of the serpent the seed of his supper is not an imaginary thing that sees that his serpent has become flesh they are people with no conscience there are people with no uh spiritual guide they are evil and and and you will be naive to think it's not so murderers and the whole whole robbers and it's just a nature it's just a behavior they don't care it's a spirit upon them it's a spirit and a seed in them so god put laws and laws is what governs the universe laws is what governs the country as ice but isaac said if there is no i believe white line in the road then there'll be accidents that's why we have red green and yellow lights to say stop green get ready and and to go all of this is systems to check stop because the next car is passing the other way stop go so in the in the working of things that rebellion against laws against authorities is not scripture and it's not authorized by god so let's continue here now so we still need amplified let's read again let every person be loyally subject to the governing civil authorities for there is no authority except from god by his permission his sanction and those that exist to do so by god's appointment therefore was too he who resists and sets himself up against the authorities resists what god has appointed and arranged in divine order and those who resist will bring down judgment upon themselves receiving the penalty due them with three for the civil authorities are not a terror to people of good conduct but to those of bad behavior would you have no dread of him who is an authority in other words what is being said here is you supposed to dread or fear or respect who is in authority then do what is right and you will receive his approval and commendation for he is god's servant for your good is what god servant for your good but if you do wrong you should dread him and be afraid for he does not bear and wear his sword for nothing he is god's servant to execute his right punishment vengeance on the wrong door therefore one must be subject not only to avoid god's wrath and escape punishment but also as a matter of principle and sake of conscience whoa my my my my isn't this an interesting lesson tonight isn't this an interesting lesson tonight this is i don't know what hidden mystery this is but this is the mystery that coming down to hit the it be very hot no man sinful man is lawless that is why we needed a savior to convert to transform the changes to conform with god's law and will this is not something we are born with we struggle with authority or government official bosses anybody in authority and i want to say this that rebellion against all that authority reflects also a rebellion against quarters authority i remember i work in the government service and every time they bring a new law there's one reaction just trying to do this trying to do this you know sign the book they want to sign the book because everything and they're trying to bring structure and order people doesn't readily say oh is that what you want okay you don't find that the first reaction to any change any government say you know what instead of going left we want to all cars go right or whatever it is people protest why because right you want to continue the way you are you don't want no bricks on your sister but life itself has breaks like you know sting people in the attitude and the arrogance they don't understand how one day they'll be vulnerable i remember when i came down with my kidneys and had issues there and i was in my drawing room and lying on the couch and i was sleeping i was in pain and i didn't know what that pain was about and i couldn't walk and i fell down to the floor and crawling crawl into her until i called gideon call him to come and he has to help me and get me to the car and get me to the hospital and at that point i was vulnerable i couldn't walk myself i couldn't do i just depend upon somebody else and and jesus told peter you're young no you don't go away want to go but one day you'll be led where you do want to go maybe for us tonight this is it this is maybe where we don't want to go or where we have to go because this come down now to the true nitty-gritty of christianity i have seen people come back and forth to the church and i don't say a word and i speak up the spirit and i know some people are floaters they don't want to subject to no authority no authority whatsoever so they are free to go here free to go they are free and they love that freedom no that freedom is the same free thinkers i call it the outside piece of cloth that is not bright stuff kind of bright material no no because jesus wasn't like that and our desire to be like jesus means that as my father sent me so sending you this was the equation not you go out and do your own thing no as my father the same way my father sent me that's how i want to send you so therefore and then he said i am divine your branches if you feel you're the boss and you feel your own then without me you can do nothing so don't believe that because you're a branch that you could go out on your own say you know what i'm a branch they're going will die so he said now if you are bad at me my words are biting you you can ask what you will so he's come down to surrender to abide in to heal them now this is not ministry thing now this is the believer thing this is all of us okay so this surrendering we're talking about is not a one-way street no this is for everybody hope you're with me tonight and following that through okay so therefore but i want you to notice uh i want to notice jesus behavior before pilate which is very instructive and if you want to look at it notice in john 19 we want to read verse 16 watch what jesus told pilate verse 6 of sin john 19 verse 6 when the chief priest therefore an officer saw him they cried out who's he fine crucify him pilate say it unto them take ye him and crucify him but i find no fault in him the jews answered him we have a law and by our law he ought to die because he made himself the son of god when pilate therefore heard that scene he was more free went again to the judgment hall and said to jesus so pilate having a second a second thought on his whole thing and he went against the judgment hall and said to jesus when sat down when i was where you come from jesus gave him no answer in parliament said unto him speakers down not unto me oh this is a ruler right no it's doubt not that i have power to crucify thee and have power to release me jesus answered though couldn't have no power at all against me except it would give him thee from above therefore he that delivered me unto thee had the greatest sin oh give the lord some praise so jesus was saying clearly you mr man is only in that position because my father permit that or authorize that jesus understood that so you see what we're talking about now and that's what i'm saying that even for the law to be issued that people paid taxes and everybody to go back to their home country mary and joseph was not in position that call that government call and they submitted themselves and even though she was pregnant even though she was heavy with child they still obeyed the law to get into position where they're supposed to be but the thing about that is that would fulfill the scripture so so many times things are happening all around but behind it is scripture being fulfilled you're with me tonight oh blessed be the name of the lord now the challenge with many of us is the unwillingness to submit and i want to propose tonight or put on the table tonight as but isaac of time we say we're having a conversation i want to say we are called to suffer we are called to be in submission we are called to surrender and submission is from the heart not the head the heart and when we get rid of the spirit of rebellion we will have access to submission i hear people say i want this one push me around that is how they interpret authority that is how they interpret someone having power over them so the boss given instructions do this go do that do the maybe they might raise their voice but guess what nicey boss you raise your voice tuna yes i'm saying you know what you can raise back your voice at the boss that you're working at because that boss is in a position is that boss that employ you you are the worker that is the owner that is the boss other boys say he doesn't want it so like somebody talk about the the blueprint and they build the house and he might come and check the blueprint he said but there's nothing here he said break it down that's not what i paying for break it down i want watch on this paper here what the architect draw this is what has to be and when god come for this bride in last days god and look and say oh that is by okay okay no no he has a blueprint and the blueprint is what looking for it has to be in the statue of perfect man it has to be that it can't be well you know that might we we it has moved so we can do it so it doesn't have that thing guys the local panel thing you know coming with that we see it so it doesn't matter you see it is what is the expectation of god and god expectation is the word to become flesh and if the word become flesh that means that we will be submissive to the spirit we'll be led by the spirit and as measure led by the spirit of god they are the sons of god so it's not word understanding it's not even that it's not word knowledge now it's coming like it's come like this it's not even how much holy ghost you have is how much holy ghost have you or how much you are surrendered to so it makes a huge difference it's not how much information that you have is how much you yield to what you're hearing go give the lord some praises oh thank you lord jesus because as i think but isaac said it for everybody to have a complaint there's somebody that have worse than that and doing the very best in the given situation see amen so praise the lord let's continue okay so um okay we want to look at matthew 8 5-10 and this is an interesting scripture and i hope that based upon what we said so far you may see this in a different light matthew 8 reading from verse 5 and when jesus was entered into capernaum that came unto him a centurion beseeching him now this centurion is not a baptized believer he's a gentile he's an unbeliever he's a centurion and with six and saying lord my servant lied at home sick of the palsy grievously tormented and jesus said unto him i will come and heal him so jesus so so all these centurions to do is to keep quiet because jesus said i will come here this centurion answered and said lord i am not worthy that thou should just come under my roof but speak the word only and my servant shall be healed now here is revelation here his revelation for i am a man under authority note he did not say our man in authority he said i am a man under authority having soldiers under me i say to this man go he go away and another come and he comment unto my servant do this and he do it when jesus heard it he marveled and said to them that followed very nice unto you i have not found so great of faith no not in israel no this man tapped into the principle of what it means to be under authority because what it means to be under authority is to have authority because you can't be you can't have authority if you're not under authority do you understand that tonight so in other words if you are not submissive authority you can't have authority so the wife that is not submissive to a husband or bring it in contextual and she believes she's more spiritual than him and she don't want to listen to him rarely and truly she is not spiritual she is religious let me see it good she is not spiritual she's religious there's a question i don't have it here tonight but somebody i guess was a sister asked from the question should i submit myself to my husband because he's an unbeliever okay or this is a question a sincere question on this question and brother bomb say sister yes it's a dear um you should submit and you know and he went into it to show what it must be because you see you could take that he is an unbeliever therefore i don't have to listen i don't have the subject because he is this kind like your boss is that this your boss is this or the government is this or the comment is that that is irrelevant what you have to be concerned with not what others do but what you are called to do let me give the lord a hand to pray so it's not how others act is your action that is what is being is important as i often tell people remember it's not the others being tested as you are is you being tested so don't make excuses well you know is this one and that one i know there are people who cannot accept responsibility for not me nothing i've dealt with it not me no i'm not i'm not taking blame for that who is to take the blame and that is why they don't learn because they're not accepting responsibility for their actions and their attitudes it is easy to make excuses let me say it again it is easier to make excuses than to accept responsibility for actions and attitudes think whereas let's talk about parents i was a big team we need to go in there and i kind of appreciate now the bible study and what we could share um outside of preaching itself because you know we could get some things are more caught than taught so i hope you catch some things in between because some parents don't want to accept responsibility for how things work with their children and they are responsible for many many things having certain influences even influences in the church towards the pastor towards the pastor's wife towards the ministry even that because according to what the parents tell the children the children and the study parents and bad spirit bad attitude you know not humbling themselves not you can't even tell them anything because they already get seated in their heart and mind and there's nothing you could do it binds you because that's not how it's supposed to be praise the name of the lord so submission being submitted surrendered is part of this christian walk now i stumble upon this scripture and just blew my mind and this is from titus you have to find this one titus tree and you want to read verse one tonight this this blew me out when i read this one titus 3 1-9 put them in mind talking about believers to be subject to principalities and powers to obey magistrates to be ready for every good work to speak evil of no man to be no brawlers but gentle showing all meekness unto all men for we ourselves the comparison now we're sometimes foolish disobedient deceived saving divers lust and pleasures living in malice and envy hateful and hating one another but after that the kindness and the love of god our savior towards us appeared not by works of righteousness which we have done but according to his mercy he saved us by the washing of regeneration and renewing of the holy ghost which he shared on us abundantly through jesus christ our savior that being justified by his grace we should be made ears according to the hope of eternal life this is a faithful scene these things i will that though affirm constantly that they which have believed in god might be careful to maintain good works these things are good and profitable under men but avoid foolish questions and genealogies and contentions and strivings about the law for the unprofitable now listen to the amplified of that and this ties in with the message that i preached recently about putting them in members of these things chapter 3 verse 1 it says remind people to be submissive to their magistrates on authorities to be obedient to be prepared and willing to do any upright and honorable work this is what we're doing tonight reminding you that this is also the word so if let's say i tell you when you're coming to the church where the mask in the bus or the car or whatever when he commented you could take it to what am i encouraging doing that if i as your pastor tell you where that the seats are there but when you come into it yeah among the wedding pass you know what i saw in there a seed of rebellion against instruction and authority and everything else that is what it meant because they they oppressing us for this mask the tree now all that is mislocation and dislocation of the scripture that is not the seed that you're supposed to have that's not the seed you're supposed to receive because also understand it's a pandemic i know people call it plan that makes it somebody planet but the point is it is a pandemic it is something that affecting everybody around the world it doesn't matter who doesn't matter where doesn't watercolor doesn't matter here it doesn't matter race or creed it doesn't matter it's affecting our world and yet there's a bride on the earth a bride that will stand amen by the word of god so what remind people to be submissive to their ministry right to be prepared and willing to do any upright in our work just what to slander or abuse or speak evil of no one to avoid being contentious to be forbearing for bearing means yielding gentle conciliatory and to show unqualified courtesy towards everybody brother recently asked me a question you talk about somebody who fighting a message blast me missing what not fell ill and whatnot how should he deal with him and i told him with all respects with all help and assistance in other words you have to detach yourself from the fact this man is anti-message anti-disorder that have nothing to do with how you behave towards that man how many understand that tonight so you cannot say you know what you see people get in trouble with god without you because paul before he become poor was saul saul was persecuting a christian but saul's name was in the book so people go through different stages and whatnot and we even though people are bad behave and and indifferent and whatnot we are not the ones to write them off so to speak we can say you know what that behavior is really terrible but the bible says the enemy hungry what to do feed him if the enemy thirsty give him something to drink this is the christian behavior this is the attitude if you if they accidentally walk one mile go with them two if they actually for the court give them the cloak also this is similar in the mount you mean we gotta get back there yes you have to get back there because this is jesus christ being reproduced again in right form okay all right so watch verse 8 paul said in the amplified this message is most trustworthy and concerning these things i want you to insist steadfastly so those who have believed trusted and relied on god they be careful to apply themselves to honorable occupations and to doing good or praising of the lord my lord my lord first peter chapter two you can find it so it's future chapter two so you get it we're getting somewhere tonight all right first peter chapter two uh who's reading verse 12. having your conversation honest among the gentiles that whereas they speak against you as evildoers they may by your good works which they shall behold glorify god in the day of visitation submit here we go that would again submit yourselves to every ordinance of man for the lord's sake whether to be a king a supreme on to governors as unto them that are sent by him for punishment of evildoers and for the praise of them that will for so is the will of god that will well doing you may put to silence the ignorance of foolish men as free watch and not using your liberty as a cloak of maliciousness but a servant of god honor all men love the brotherhood fear god honor the king i think i did a bible study on all men love the brotherhood but let's look at the amplified of this conduct yourself properly honorably righteously among the gentiles why so that although they may slander you as he will do as yet they may by witnessing your good deeds come to glorify god in the day of inspection and god shall look upon you wanderers as pastors or shepherd looks over his flock verse 13 amplified be submissive to every human institution and authority for the sake of the lord whether it be of emperor or supreme or the governors are sent by him to bring vengeance or punishment and justice to those who do wrong and to encourage those to do good service for it is god's will here we go an intention that by doing right your good and honest lives should silence muzzle guard the ignorant charges and ill-informed criticism of foolish persons live as free people yet here we go without employing your freedom as a pretext for wickedness but live all at all times as servants of god show respect for all men treat them honorably love the brotherhood the christian fraternity of which christ is ahead reverence god honor the emperor and about to wrap up here this is the home stretch hebrews 13 17 it says obey them this is the twitch now that have ruled over you and submit yourselves for they watch for your souls as they that must give an account that they may do it with joy and i put grief for that is unprofitable for you the amplifier of that scripture is just one scripture there hebrews 13. it says obey your spiritual leaders and submit to them continually recognizing the authority over you for they are constantly keeping watch over your souls and guarding your spiritual welfare as men who will have to render an account of their trust do your part too let them do this with gladness and not with sign and groaning but that would not be comfortable for you you know as i said that remember there's a a statement but obama made powerful statement you say you can only serve god as you do believe the servant whom god of sin to you interpret the word to you by divine inspiration you could only serve god as you do and believe the servants whom god have sent interpret to you the word by divine inspiration so if the word is interpreted by divine inspiration like some time ago when i was talking about the lepers you see if we stay here we will die we go back we'll die we go forward and i was talking to that in reference to the coronal virus it was i was inspired i was given that to share to you all um in other words the core of that is you can't sit and do nothing if you do nothing you just waiting for the virus and that will make you like a foolish person in that sense if you do nothing at all so it was something that i would say inspire and this is where you have to be careful is not man trying something and pelting a scripture or pelting things because you don't know how things come like i shared with isaac where is that consider you know i'm coming something come to me and surrender about uh submitting and submission and so on like that it's not like if i'm trying to work up something it's it's inspiration and things that come and we get it and we share it and we trust that this will edify am i surrendered to god this is important now we're not talking about church now people come to church and that's all they do come to church they have nothing to do with the word having an effect upon their lives and reigning over them we want husbands subject to the word we want wives subjected to the word we want children subject this is the only way we can truly get into ephesians people have to recognize the authority of the word over their lives or you could choose to run your own life they don't want anybody tell you anything about rampage doors and doors you have certain doors you don't want christ come in the clue there's a private door as a private door you want all he does open up to come in if you really want to surrender you claim that you want him to be your lord lord mean ruler master you claim that he is supposed to be your lord you're not talking about the pastor you're not a modern minister no more christ the lord of your life and the only way he could be lord of your life is to the extent that you are willing to surrender and we would you would see it even deeper as we bring in the wrap up here now the clues all right now brother brown you are saying this here always the acts of the holy spirit and the apostles for it was the holy spirit in the apostles setting forth an example through all the ages what the holy spirit was then it is now and what the holy spirit did to that church it does this the district and this church here we go will just will be just as submissive to it as that church was it will bring just the same results he said if this church was just as submitted to it as that's what it was it would bring the same results you believe that it will just your submission to christ here we go now he said no one he said abram of course was the seed of heath was the seed he said oh but abraham if you catch it he had faith in god which united the spirit of god with the flesh of man this is big this is this is huge abraham if you catch it he had faith in god which united the spirit of god with the flesh of man dear is where faith come there is why he could be the abraham seed not all flesh but the uniting of the spirit and flesh together god making himself tearing out rooting out all evil bringing the submission of flesh the dust that he created and live with you as a partner so that is the that is the gist of it god coming and rooting out evil from in us and making that abode and abiding with the spirit and fresh connect together and making you a partner with but abram was so much like christ till they thought he was christ think about it now keep born in sin shape iniquity and no education illiterate and so on like that and yet he could manifest christ and uh and this was a powerful thing he said you must get here he said watch for the brandon you say you know me i only have a grammar school education i know nothing of psychology i know nothing about medics about cartoon anatomy he said but only thing i know i love the lord jesus christ through my heart that's all i know i'm uneducated illiterate i have not believed in my own but i know one thing i'm thankful for i know how to submit myself that jesus christ can work through me we'll give the lord a honor praise or give the lord a hand of praise on that one oh blessed be the name of the lord my my mind he said i know how to submit you know what he say are gifted so real gifted a gift is not man taken and just doing things a gift is how to get out of the way i want a gift so when we could get out of the way you see the operation of the gift truly okay so it gets there as we hit the home stretch here we about finish he says i know to submit myself that jesus christ can work for me i rather have that than all your education days in the world i rather know how to submit myself to the spirit of god and say lord here i am i rather have that secret in my heart that have this than have the secret of every hydrogen and atomic bomb in the world that could be made for it's more powerful than all the atomic bombs that could be taught us so under his everlasting wings i take my refuge tonight here we go god and god could ever get a man a woman today in this type of anywhere else that will pay no attention to what's going on around them but submit themselves to the lord as an individual unto god god will lead the same man today that he led them he proves that he's with us what we need today is a humble submitted life submit yourself don't squeeze yourself back don't do nothing but lead straight with the holy spirit what the holy spirit says do do quickly don't say well i'll wait and find out this and that no what the holy spirit would just go and do it you're almost there sometimes we do things that we do not understand our own doings if we are led by the spirit of god every child of god in my hearing or hearing my voice wrong knows that sometimes that you do things that you think yourself is ridiculous when you are so closing with god when the holy spirit gets you in such a condition until you are fully surrendered to him i have seen men so filled with the devil until it would take several men to hold him then he's comparing if satan can put that kind of a power on a man fully surrendered to him how much more power can the holy spirit put on a man that is surrendered to him to make a person a wheelchair rise and walk to make the shadow of a man die with cancer or cut jumped his feet screaming under the pulse pod how much stronger is god under there and here we go oh reach a final quote cut every obstacle from human beings that they might be connected with the garden of eden i was going to choke it but i'm going to see it man is omnipotent you don't believe that but he is a man fully surrendered to god is omnipotent did not he said in mark 11 22 who said verse things you see don't doubt in your heart you come the past you can have what you said friends this is it for tonight that's the final thing that i have written down and uh i'm hoping to get a heart this is a little more than hearing the word being submissive is taking action and there's a scripture i just didn't have the time i would have loved to find it i if anybody knows knows it they could they could get it from me but it's a scripture dealing with a man that lost a war and he surrendered and he said all that i am all that i have and something like that i give to thee to the man that conquered it and it's a scripture that identifies real surrender he wasn't holding back anything you know when you surrender a proper white flag i hope some of you with your red truck pull on your red flag and burn it and up goes the white flag tonight is a sign of surrender it's a sign of lord i i i repented my rebellion i repent of my own thoughts and ideas and attitudes i really want a submitted life to you because all what you have known naturally all what you feel that you have to boast about it will come to naught as you get older as time takes its toll the plane field levels you could have several houses several cars several planes you could have whatever money after a while the cars can't help you you don't know if you could be able to drive the swimming pool you might be able to step into that pool the money can't help you because the conditioner might be in it doesn't apply just people dying different causes whether it's old age heartache chronovirus whatever it is but after a while the money can't help the children can't help the family can't help you would need god sincerely then so why not why not tonight surrender why not tonight yield yourself give it over to god your life your wealth your health your strength your love your service say lord all that i have you have given to me and i want to surrender all to you father you know declares easter less time and chance happened to all men you know become like somebody in the country and somebody in the city city have more opportunities country have limited and so on and it's just because of life that somebody is born in a certain place and some boy born and next place and opportunities open to them but this the night of the insurance that opened to all of us this is for whosoever and i could see it clearer now and deeper now you hear me say it many times but abandon says the world will bow a defeat of men and women who cross jordan he didn't say pastors he didn't say ministers he said men and women who caused joy jordan represent death debt to self get to your thoughts and ideas get to your own leader there's some people are led by spirits think talking to them telling them and guiding them they wouldn't talk to the pastor who could tell them yeah the spirit on you get realistic forget it because it's not scripture you see because the scriptural voice would bring order the scriptural voice would bring surrender the scriptural voice will bring you to accept rebuke accept responsibility for your actions attitude and your visit take instructions because remember we have not been this way before we are here to receive guidance that is why go to joshua measured it makes it in the world there night joshua can't come and say i'm always minister no you don't imagine the word there night let me take it take the land take the land and take it you get crushed during that the object of meditation the object of the thinking god's word and trying to absorb that is in order to please you your flesh want to do something to read the word is the discipline to praise the decision he does his feet feeling literal can be faithful let's ball ahead simon is anybody dear who want to surrender i can't see your faces i'm not in your homes but you could have it in your own heart tonight and you could tell god in your own way lord i want to surrender maybe you can begin to pray in your own way right at your home i want to heal myself i've heard i would tonight i see surrendering and being submissive from a different perspective it's not abusive it's not oppressive it's not something trying to keep it back from remy one thing no jesus rebuked jesus was beaten jesus was spoken to and didn't even matter until the man said the wrong thing saying about the power he had jesus had to remind him the power you have is what my father gave you that's why you are in the position you're in and the power only power we could have is what god has given us and i want to tell you something tonight god has released the power that we can surrender oh thank you lord thank you jesus the power is here that you could surrender heavenly father i thank you tonight this has been coming to me and i share with your people father i i don't know how it comes out lord but you fitted together in their own hearts and minds in a way that they will give up you would raise that red flag of surrender wise who have been rebellious and carrying on with what kind of nonsense and attitude and hard face and bad spirit and bad ways they will adjust their position the people in the church as wife of christ they would adjust their behavior and attitude lord and humble themselves as christ did you didn't have to do it you could have built a whole new world whole new generation whole new people whole new gardener eden you're gonna make a different kind of reboot but you choose to come and redeem sinful man you choose to go to calvary and pay the price you choose to shed your blood and release your spirit that we could be here in this room tonight god even though we know education of the devil and technology all these things is of the enemy yet in this same scenario this is what we are using tonight technology that has been built for this time and season father when the church was lost the bible and it couldn't be read it was tied in the catholic church he anointed a man martin luther and he was able to preach the word then he anointed wesley and right in the middle there they brought the germans to develop the print and press and the word was back in print back being shared spread all around the world and then when you wanted a prophet to come to identify the days of the voice you had man to create them make and invent the tape recorder and that caught the voice of malachi 4 william marion branham the prophet have it on tapes and then we broke into the deeper into the internet where we could see now i've heard by the hearing of the ear but now i see and now we are full internet now there's no nothing further than this now instantly connected no separation not dial up if we could see one another we could hear a voice from any part of this world god what a blessed people we are we have no excuse to whom much has given much is expected father i want you tonight to bless those here in a they made the effort they come to hear we're not here to abuse them god some ministers abuse the people shame them that they wouldn't say a word they have nothing to say they will shut up because they empower them in charge that's not how the church was to be operated no it was to be operated by love the love of god come in the man of god yielded to the spirit of god and he could share with sincerity with on his heart the truth to speak to the people you told the word by the word to remind the people of these things father we reminded them that this subjection god this order is what you require this was what the war was all about this was mike the the satan thought he wanted to that centered it he didn't want to subject himself to the order of him and he got kicked out because he organized a rebellion god break that rebellion off of us and those that in their hearts tonight repenting and asking for your mercy and grace and want a healthy marriage i want a healthy christian life and christian walk and christian parenting father god may you take it out to them father that husband will no longer point at wife and white point and husband and they backing out one another and the war is in the home and in the family but lord may be a peace our understanding by being submissive lord even talk about ministry be submitted one to another be kind one to another god we could only have authority when we are under authority bring us under the authority of the headship bring us under the authority of the headstone eclipsed lord may love reign and rule in our lives could this be a turning point this be a junction this be a crush rule for many here tonight that will change everything for them lord they would see it so different that the laws are not to punish us but to bring us closer to you god for romans 8 says we know all things work together for good to them that love god to them be called according to a purpose i remember when false prophecy came considering babylon and the time in babylon that they will get back soon god tell his prophets tell them get married have children call your media with how much years 70 years oh god and those who don't want to bother with that they'll be punished because god wanted them good on the babylon father god here we are here we are in this earth lord waiting for this third exodus where we will leave this earth and this mortal to put on immortality and we find out deeper tonight before we leave here the spirit have to bring this flesh and subjection god how we need your spirit tonight would you come and fill us fill our minds our hearts take out canality they call unbelief they go to every worldly thing every will desire push us tonight and cleanse our hearts we surrender all to you oh i thank you for this time this fellowship and your people gathered here bless the calebs that's the young ones oh god forgive or pass and bless your future as we wait upon you father remember those that are sick in our midst heal them all those prayer requests lord that haven't sent father god may you minister and answer their prayer in the name of jesus we ask it remember the ministry remember the service tomorrow night father we committed to your hands at your blessing report upon your people oh god the meeting on friday and the service on sunday committed to their hands in jesus name we ask
