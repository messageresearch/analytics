evening wonderful we thank God for his grace we thank God for taking us through another year and for allowing us to be in the house of the Lord to meet a new year so I have two portions of scripture we'll read one of them uh then we'll pray take our seats and we'll read the other reading a very familiar portion of scripture Hebrew 13 and verse 8 Jesus Christ the same yesterday and today and forever may the Lord add a blessing to the reading of his word can we bow our heads for a word of prayer our gracious Heavenly Father we thank you for your love for your grace for your mercy Lord for taking us through 2024 and for allowing us to see another day to see this month to see this service Lord and to be on the brink of 2025 and what you have in store for us Lord we could look back over the year and we can say it has been you father it has not been our strength it has not been our ability but we could see you have taken us through and we are trusting you to take us forward so father may you take complete control of every situation take complete control of Our Lives take complete control of this service may you walk out the pages of the Bible may you anoint the read reading of the word may you bless the hearing of it may you speak lip to ear to your children may you take me out of the way and may you Lord have your perfect will in the service tonight in the precious name of Jesus Christ and the church says amen and amen you may be seated certainly a great privilege to see one and all and old days night service is always a special service you know for some people it's way beyond their bed time for some people this is their time you know there are those who are morning people there are those who are evening people and uh but it's always a great significant point when you switch from one year to the next many people trying to figure out how they're going to enter the new year and we thank God that he has given us the grace to find ourselves appreciating the New Year in the house of God because we are dependent upon him for the source of our supply we are dependent on him to take us through we are dependent on him to keep us can the church say amen amen so I want to also read from uh the book of John 12 a couple verses in there so that's why I ask you to take your seat but I want to kind of get a context for this thought to take us into 2025 John 12 and from verse one then Jesus 6 days before the Passover came to Bethany so this is we are we are on the horizon or on the border of a transition a change in Jesus's Ministry he's facing the crucifixion he is facing uh the Passover is that that moment there you know just before he's crucified in Jesus 6 days before the Passover came to Bethany where Lazarus was which had been dead whom he raised from the dead so Jesus is is at a place now and is is a special time because everybody knows that Lazarus was dead but now there's a gathering around Jesus and Lazarus who was dead is there verse two he's alive there they made him a supper and Martha served but Lazarus was one of them that sat at the table with him could you imagine the picture there's Jesus he's sitting down he's about to eat some food and there are people peeking in because it's not just about Jesus sitting on eating food Lazarus who had been dead is also on the table could you imagine you come to church and you see somebody who is dead sitting down at the table eating what a what a dinner what a service Hallelujah then took Mary a point of a pound of ointment of ND very costly and anointed the feet of Jesus I'm painting a picture and wiped his feet with her hair and the house was filled with the order of the ointment so it was so strong that a couple of things are happening Jesus is sitting down he himself is an attraction the fact that Jesus is in the house is worthy of acknowledgement worthy of of greeting worthy of a conversation on top of that you have Lazarus who everybody know was dead he wasn't in service last week because he was dead but here he is sitting down in the room can the church say amen and now Mary takes an expensive ointment and fills the whole room you can't miss it you can't wonder if there's a scent over there no the whole room is filled with the scent of this ointment that's what I'm reading the scripture the house was filled with the order of the ointment then sayth one of his disciples Judas Iscariot Simon's son which should betray him so so he's in the room so it's a it's a mixed audience in the room maybe there's a mixed audience here tonight as we approach this change of season because Jesus is about to go to a change of season and the way God changes Seasons a number of things have to happen and line up for these changes that take place can the church say amen and many times we look at situations in our life I heard somebody say recently stop saying why did this happen to me and I ask a question why did it happen for me because when God is about to do something you got to have the right picture of what's about to take place and you can look back through 2024 and there are many reasons to say why did this go wrong and why did this happen to me but if you ask a question why did it happen for me and you begin to see Jesus in every month you begin to see Jesus in every week you begin to see Jesus in every trial you begin to see Jesus in every situation in fact brother brandom said if you read the Bible and don't see Jesus in every verse you need to go read it again oh somebody helped me this evening and for a title just so you know where I'm going we need to see Jesus that's the title we need need to see Jesus I'm one preacher who's tired of church I want to see Jesus it's good to see ministers but I want to see Jesus it's good to see ERS but I want to see Jesus it's it's good to see you but I want to see Jesus I want to see Jesus in you I want to see Jesus on you I want to see him around you I want to walk into your house and know that he's living there can the church say Amen so in verse four then said one of his disciples Jud es cariot Simon son which should betray him why was not this ointment sold for 300 p and given to the poor this he said not that he cared for the poor right but because he was a thief and had the bag and bear what was put therein so he has suggestions about how to do things but the motive for his suggestion is the desire of his heart then Jesus said let her alone against the day of my burying had she kept this in other words there's a purpose for this sacrifice God sees the sacrifice he honors the sacrifice in fact a sacrifice was a sacrifice based on Revelation because she somehow knew that Messiah had to die she couldn't explain it but something came over her that drove her to do that can the church say amen and Jesus said for the poor always ye have with you but me he have not always much of the Jews therefore knew that he was there oh what is it to know that Jesus is there can the church say amen and they came not for Jesus sake only but that they might see Lazarus also whom he had raised from the dead and I got some news for you some of the trials and the situation that you've been in through and you have been going through God has kept it for a reason because even though Jesus was in the building and he this was six days before the Passover all the records of the healing and the blind seeing all of that was there but the fact that Lazarus who was dead was now alive that was an attraction and God is going to bring to life some Sons and Daughters who have been dead to prove that he's the same yesterday he's the same today he's the same forever so don't look at your situation as if everything is out of control no God is in control Lazarus was dead for a purpose oh God could have intervened if he wanted but Lazarus had to be dead so that God could prove himself alive he could prove himself a deliverer he could prove himself a resurrector he could prove himself can the Church Say Amen so don't worry about your son don't worry about your daughter don't worry about your situation don't worry about your health don't worry about your finances don't worry about your family it might look messed up it might look dead but there's a testimony in there you don't hear me this evening there's a testimony in 2024 it's been rough it's been tough but there's a testimony in there can you see Jesus in there Hallelujah Lazarus didn't pick his problem he didn't pick his trial he didn't pick what he went through but here was Lazarus sitting at the table he doesn't know even what happened to him Hallelujah one minute he was there next minute he was dead next minute he's back alive I wish I could shake his hand and say brother how did it feel he say I can't explain all of it but oh I once was dead but now I'm alive I once was blind but now I could see and I believe as we go to 2025 God is going to have some individuals who have been through some stuff here can't explain the doctors cannot explain your family cannot explain your neighbors can't explain your co-workers cannot explain your husband cannot explain your wife cannot explain and you could just say it was the Lord it was the Lord it was the Lord it was the Lord if it had not been for the Lord can the church say Amen oh Hallelujah I love this many of the Jews knew he was there there will be many people who will know because brother brandom said God is looking for a church that he could walk in a church at sin count stay in there a church without spot or wrinkle but there will be people who will come because they see you oh come on now just like they came because they saw Lazarus so if you are Lazarus this evening and you came in here Dead Oh May before this service over may you be resurrected into a fire in your soul maybe you came in here feing all D trod and saying another all is night service but tonight is my night this year is my year this season is my season oh can the church say Amen we on the home stretch this is a change of season service don't worry there's not much you can do between now and midnight the enemy has not much room to move between now and midnight I heard somebody say I don't want to brag or anything but I have enough money to finish the rest of this year I don't want to brag or anything but I have enough water to finish the rest of this year it's only 45 minutes left and if the devil squeezed everything out of you you have got everything it takes to make it to the end of this year God didn't bring you this evening to die to finish you up he brought you here to lift you up and to raise you into a new Strength a new anointing a new level a new Faith a new Zeal you could walk in here one way and leaving the world is different than the outside because you could speak your world into existence that's what the prophet taught [Applause] us hallelujah maybe you didn't have joy for the whole of January February but there's 45 minutes left Hallelujah I know you got enough joy in you maybe you didn't shout in January maybe you didn't shout in February but I know there's praise in you for the rest of 2024 if you didn't shout for this whole year now is the time to shout if you didn't lift your hands for the whole year this is the time to lift your hands if you didn't say glory to God for 364 days today is the last day of the feast the last day to put your stamp on what is recorded about you for 2024 let it be said you struggle but you end the year [Music] strong you don't hear me tonight Hallelujah you could write the end of this story there's nothing you can change about January February March April May June July or this month but the rest of this year you could tell the story I ended 2024 shouting I ended 2024 giving God a praise I ended 2024 on my feet saying the Lord Give the Lord take it away blessed be the name of the Lord I ended 2024 saying blessing and honor might and Power [Applause] [Music] [Applause] hallelujah hallelujah Glory the last page of the book of 2024 it's being written right now you could cast down reasoning you could cast down doubt leave it on the last page leave it on the last page there's a few minutes left to close out this page to close out this chapter Hallelujah God is not going to choose for you you have to choose can the church say Amen let's finish read the scripture you see why I couldn't read it with everybody standing up verse n much people of the Jews therefore knew that he was there and they came not for Jesus sake only but that the mighty Lazarus also people want to shake by the Lazarus hand whom he had raised from the dead but I want to see the picture imagine people are there to Rejoice brother Mike they just happy that Lazarus is there but verse 10 but the chief priests consulted that they might put Lazarus to death they want to kill him again they don't like the fact that he was dead and now alive they don't like the fact that that that he had a rough 2024 look like they're signs alive oh come on now somebody help me so the enemy is there trying to consult to put him back to death because Listen by reason of him many of the Jews went and believed on Jesus can the church say Amen there are many in here this evening you are here because somebody testified of the goodness of Jesus you saw somebody's life change and say I want to be like that Lazarus transformation was such a testimony they still we need to kill him and you do you understand why the devil is out to get you because whenever you lift your head up and the devil think but why he not D why he not sad why he didn't stay home why he didn't live in depression but every time the devil push you down something in you get back up because greater is he that's in you than he that's in the world you not built to give up giving up not part of who you are you might have rough moments but giving up is not who you are backslide is not no oh come on [Applause] now verse 12 on the next day much people that would come to the feast when they heard that Jesus was coming to Jerusalem took branches of palm trees and went forth to meet him and cried hosana blessed is the king of Israel that cometh in the name of the Lord and Jesus when he had found a young ass sat there on as it is written fear not Daughter of Zion behold I King comeet sitting on an ass's cult these things understood not his disciples at the first so this is happening and the disciples don't understand what's happening but when Jesus was glorified then remembered they that these things were written of him that they had done these things unto him the people therefore that was with him when he called Lazarus out of his grave and raised him from the dead bear record for this cause the people also met him for that they heard that he had done this miracle the Pharisees therefore said among themselves perceive ye how you Prevail nothing in other words you see how our ministry not doing anything behold the world is going after him this is where I want to get to and there were certain Greeks among them that came up to worship at the feast they came to do what they came to do what the same came therefore to Philip so these are not Jews now these are Gentiles and they came to worship and the same came Dev to Philip which was of Bethesda of Galilee and desire him saying sir we would see Jesus so in other words these Greeks who had come to worship were not satisfied to just come to worship ship they wanted to see Jesus hallelujah it's it's one thing to come to church to worship but it's something different when you want to see Jesus this is where I got the title it's evening we need to see Jesus we have come to worship many a service but oh God help me tonight I want to see Jesus I need to see Jesus because if I just get to Jesus then everything is going to be all right if I could just Touch the Hem of His Garment if he could give a word in my situation if he could speak into my situation Hallelujah philli cometh and tell it Andrew and again Andrew and Philip tell Jesus and Jesus answered them saying the hour is come so he is responding to the question about seeing Jesus he said the hour has come that a son of man should be glorified this is the first time he is speaking this way verily verily I say unto you except a corn of wheat fall into the ground and die it abided alone but if it die it bringeth forth much fruit and as we close out this year and enter into a new year he that loveth his life shall lose it and he that hated his life in this world shall keep it un life eternal If any man serve me and I preach on this a while back about serving God what does that actually mean you serve god with your time your substance your effort serving you know what someone is serving because what you serve is what you reflect so Jesus is saying if any man serve me let him follow me and where I am there all there shall also my servant be if any man serve me him will my father honor are we serving the lord are we servants to the Lord is our time in service to the Lord Lord is our our words in service to the Lord our resources in service to the Lord verse 27 we wrapping up here now now is my soul trouble and what shall I say father save me from this hour but for this cause came I into this hour father glorify thy name then came there a voice from Heaven saying I have both glorified it and will glorify it again the people therefore that stood by heard it said that it hundered others said an angel spoke to him so the people who were there were hearing Thunders and hearing voices Jesus answered and said this voice came not because of me but for your sakes now is the Judgment of this world now shall the prince of this world be cast out and I if I be lifted up from the earth will draw all men unto me this he said signifying what death he shall die may the Lord had a blessing to the reading of his word can we give the Lord a hand of praise just a few more minutes to close of this year everybody feeling fine everybody give the devil a knockout punch because if it didn't give him a knock a punch with yeah this is the time you have half an hour to knock him in one time somebody was in service and they had their gums and they say what are you doing here you say well if if if I don't have the teeth I will use my gums for the devil whatever I got I got to use it for the kingdom of the Lord can the church say Amen so let's go we need to see Jesus in the message I know my redeemer live it but they said God's purpose can never be defeated there is nothing can defeat it so how happy ought we to be today resting upon that beautiful revelation of the word of the Living God that there is no neither things present nor things that can come there's no sickness no sorrow no death no perils no nothing can separate us from the purpose of the Living God what God has imagined in his mind what God has purposed in his heart to bring to pass there is no demon there is no power there is nothing that can ever separate God's Great Immortal Eternal plan it must be as God has said oh I want that to rest on you this evening there's nothing will stop the plan the purpose the heart the mind and these words I want you to see that brother brandham is Ping a picture God has a mind God has a heart God has a purpose God has a plan God has a faith God has eyes God has a voice God has feet can the church say Amen the same way you have a mind God has a mind the same way you have a heart God has a heart the

nothing present past Left Right could stop him because he oh come on on somebody preach back to me Jesus wants to come into your 16 elements and watch cancer go down watch high blood pressure disappear because when Jesus Takes up his residence light and darkness cannot live in the same house when Jesus Takes up his residence doubt and fear cannot live there when Jesus comes into that house

that is Joel that is [Music] Malon because they know how you used to live they know what they used to do they know what you went through is that Andrew but when they look they'll see Jesus and they'll take note that if God could do it for you he could do it for me if you could do it for that sister he could do it for that sister if and he's the same yesterday he's the same today he's the same forever this great gospel we're preaching about is not for us to have church services no it's for us to bring Jesus under [Applause] scene listen friends not just it's easy to say the Holy Spirit and the presence of God but that's not what God's objective is it was God above them it was God god with them and his whole design was to be God in them and friends when God is in you you live different you talk different you laugh different you eat different you look at the world different can the church say Amen so to catch this you have to recognize your day and your message we are not regular

love it when you call upon him but everybody I'm say when you talk about him he comes near he draws near people know quotes but they don't know Jesus they know the message but they don't know Jesus they know church but they don't know Jesus they know the pastor but they don't know Jesus they know conventions but they don't know Jesus they know rules and regulations but they don't know Jesus we need to see Jesus we want to hear from him tonight we want to talk to him tonight we want him to move freely tonight can the Church Say Amen hallelujah hallelujah Glory Glory Glory Glory Glory Glory brother brandham said in that day they couldn't recognize him they couldn't see him are you with me why couldn't they see him even when Lazarus was raised from the dead they couldn't see him you know the Bible said that God blinded them because had he not blinded them we wouldn't stand a chance so you imagine how God feels when his own he came unto his own and his own receive him not because in his mind he is thinking about somebody and he has to Blind and the prophet said they were blind for our sake they were made blind but the BAM said that's the reason he cried for forgiveness forgive them for they know not what they're doing that they know not what they doing was a mystery that the prophet opened up that said it was because they were blind and they didn't even know that it was Grace to the Gentiles that God has blinding them so when they rejected him they had no idea what they were doing because they were blinded because you had to be grafted in you had to be found Royal seeds of Abraham Royal priests Gentile dispens a group of people who never had a chance to begin with the Bible said in time past we never a people but now there are a people with Divine access to the power of God what a reason to celebrate what a reason to [Applause] shout so but random says in the sixfold purpose of Gabriel's visit to Daniel so when you see people say I don't believe in Divine Healing I can't see it I can't see this baptism of the Holy Ghost don't be angry with them they are blind they say I can see this message of him coming friends there will be people you will meet you will never see this message they think you're crazy they think you're following a man you can't they can't help themselves they have not been given the eyes to see this blessed are your eyes blessed are your ears Hallelujah and you have heard by the hearing of the air for all of these years under the ministry of the voice but now is the time as job said for my eyes to see s we would see [Music] Jesus can the church say Amen am in the message he identified Christ of all ages no one has ever heard of him but longed but what longed to see him in other words when they hear about Jesus something stirs in your heart and if something not stirring in your heart you need to check your heart real fast but say cuz when you hear about it he say I'm sure that if I get acent how many of you would like to see Jesus let's put it to the test how many would like to see Jesus but over there just making sure everybody up in can't show me ask you how many would love to see Jesus but BR said if you ask a question every hand would go up he said there's not a person that ever heard of him that they don't want to see him there's something about even his name but the B said it just enchants us you know how many stories there are of just pleading the name of Jesus I saw a video one time of a of a robbery about to take place people breaking into a home and the woman in the home just start to scream Jesus them Bandits jump back over the fence so fast they don't even know what happened to them she just had to plead there's power in the name of Jesus you know you know much stories that have of people being robbed attacked gone to their face and it's had to pray and man who was thought it was bad man start to rec he he that bad because of the sound of Jesus something come over him he said I I have feeling this robbery tonight I I have feeling to do this I just feel different we could bring people who could tell you what they've been through where you have no other word to say but just one word the name of Jesus you have no time to pray you have no time to no you say Lord Jesus and at that point in you need something oh come on now somebody help me preach this evening brother B say there's something about even his name it just enchants us there's something about that trills our heart just to hear that name Jesus because in that name we have forgiveness of sin I don't know what you came in here tonight with whatever sin condemnation but the name of Jesus in that name there's forgiveness of sin what sin you ever came whatever sin you ever committed in that name there's power over your sin power over your in that name the said we have our Redemption for the whole family in heaven will bear that name Hallelujah God taken his human name to be placed upon himself when he was manifested in the flesh what a wonderful name we need to see Jesus can the church say Amen brother brandham said I think job is considered one of the oldest books of the Bible and job in their cried out one time if I could only see him if I know where I could go to his house oh Hallelujah job say could you tell me his address if you could just tell me his address I want to go see him for myself oh where does Jesus live if I could just knock on his door and say would you come and see me I want to see you can the church say Amen brother said we all know that we come from somewhere there's something in US reaches out for something that we know we come from somewhere we cannot be just like we are without being something behind us to make us in other words but saying we are too complicated we are too welld designed we are too well constructed we there's too much work and effort has gone into you being here for there for for there to not to exist something more powerful than us but every said when you look at the achievements of man and what man could achieve if Man by Design could achieve that there has to be something greater than man for man to be able to achieve what man oh you don't hear me this evening I'm getting to the court brother Anthony but Anthony is preaching my course before I reach it he said there's something in us he said we cannot be like we are without being something behind us to make us my watch could not just have happened so BR I'm saying the watch on your hand a make itself somebody make the watch anyone with their right mind would know that watch jewels and timing and Regulation and springs and hands I'm reading the prophet it just could not have happened it's impossible for it to happen look at the rest of the creation how it's set together we know it could not have just happened how much greater is a man than a watch the man designed the watch and timed it and put it together so if it's impossible for that watch to just happen how much greater is it that you and I just happen to be here there has got to be a Creator behind us if we watch his great creation how it moves and how he lives in it lives in it we notice the leaf how a leaf hangs on a tree and around the middle of August without Frost or anything the leaf leaves it the life leaves it and it goes down into the root the leaf drops off and goes right down on top of the ground now what's the matter there is some intelligence that speaks to it too so but said there's an intelligent that speaks to the leaf oh you don't there's an intelligent that speaks to the bird when a storm is coming and if a bird could recognize the intelligence and if a leaf could recognize the intelligence what's up with man can man recognize the intelligent oh come on now do you hear his voice tonight do you hear his intelligence saying come to me worship me praise me break out the humanistic realm lift up your head for Redemption Jo it night Hallelujah [Music] the tree has no intelligence of his own so the life goes down to the root of the tree to hide it from the cold weather if it stayed up there it would die but winter would kill it so what does the leaf do it lays in the ground and ruts what does the life do while it's in the root it sucks back the substance from that dead leaf the calcium and whatever goes into it and Rises up again in the spring and comes right back to his place again bringing another Leaf it's a test Money death burial and Resurrection that's right can the church say Amen the sun rises in the morning like a little baby born 8 or 9:00 it's in school 10:00 it's out of school 12:00 it's in the middle age and then it starts dying dies again and sinks in the west is that all of it rises up the next morning to testify Life Death burial Resurrection everything all God lives in his creation he does that and has done it Through the Ages can the Church Say Amen amen woo but the M said now if we're not serving him then let's get away from the thing we're doing and go serve him because after all what good is our profession if there's nothing to it and our sincerity can the church say Amen can we give the Lord a hand of Praise Glory my my my my Glory Glory [Music] Glory we see things happening when the message looked butam said to the world it's just as blind to them as it was in the days of Noah but to we who look for Christ the second time it's an end sign that he is soon coming we see something fixing to happen and depends on what you're looking at now no one knew by the word of God that there was coming a flood by faith he saw it he knew that was going to be because God's word promised it now Noah himself by faith saw what God's word said but the world could not see it because it could not scientifically prove that there was water up in the sky but no one knew it was there because God said so and that's the church the bride call out today knows that the coming of the Lord is at hand regardless of how much we've been able to go in progress and so forth and succeed in splitting an actum and sending a radar message to the Moon that means nothing to they believe only a sign that the coming of the Lord is at hand we see Nations breaking and the Nations coming falling apart the world coming apart the church move coming apart and we are taught that we receive a kingdom which cannot be moved can the church say Amen Glory Hallelujah Hallelujah Hallelujah Hallelujah Glory Glory Glory Glory Glory so as we getting ready to close out this year Church the Bible said that when the enemy comes in like a flood this the spirit would raise a standard how does he raise a standard by taking the same word and making it more positive the same message we have had all these years by making it more positive Hallelujah and the enemy for many people that's coming like a flood has swept into home swept into lives and there's a there's a terrible thing about a flood because when a flood happens it it takes you a long time to recover you lose appliances rain falls for a prolonged period of time sweep into home it destroys livestock property Hallelujah you can't even fight a flood it's hard to fight a flood you could build a house to withstand earthquake and stuff but flood is different because water finds a way to move a earthquake could last for a few seconds and then it has done the damage is done but a flood is different because a flood affects the water supply it affects food crop it affects agriculture they say after flood don't buy certain perishable items they go to don't go to the market the next day after a flood because you don't know where these vegetables were and the say when the enemy comes in like a flood the spirit has to raise a standard a flood could last for months you know and the impact of a flood can last for months Hallelujah but when the enemy comes in like a flood the spirit of raise a standard by taking the same word and making it more positive and the standard that is being raised in the Lord Jesus Christ it is what identifies who we are listen God is Not Now setting a standard his standard has been set and the standard is the Lord Jesus Christ we are raising the standard we are lifting Jesus Higher tonight we need to see Jesus he's a standard of our history he's a standard of our future he's a standard of what we stand for he's a standard of what we believe hallelujah what we believe not just church Jesus Christ the same yesterday he is our Banner he is our standard he is our Shield In the Heat of the battle when you lift the banner it lets you know there are other soldiers fighting and In the Heat of our battle when you look to Jesus you know all is well because he's fighting with you he's in the middle of the battle he's in the middle of your trial he's in the middle of the situation when you see the banner rise you know it's time to Rally around the banner and I say tonight let's rally around the Lord Jesus Christ you rally around church church will fail you rally around man man will fail but if you rally around the Lord Jesus Christ he can never fail he's the same yesterday today and forever God is not trusting his standard to any man he is the standard and the spirit is raising the standard in this season can the church say Amen oh let's lift him higher it's not a new standard it's the same standard Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever one Lord one Fai one baptism same signs same wonders Same Spirit seven manifestation a of one Holy Spirit the person of the Lord Jesus Christ can the church say Amen Oh Glory Glory Glory Glory s we would see Jesus we need to see Jesus we need to see Jesus in our homes we need to see Jesus in our prayer lives we need to see Jesus when we go on our job we need to see Jesus in the taxi we need to see Jesus everywhere we go because he's the reason for our living you need to and if your eyes is on Jesus you start to look away from the world because he's a Center of your focus he's a center of your joy he's the center of your attention you can't be looking at Jesus and looking at the world you can't look at Jesus and look at a St you can't look at Jesus and look at the worldly things no he's a Focus S we would see Jesus we want to worship but we would see Jesus we want to be in church but we need to see Jesus can the church say Amen oh hallelujah hallelujah Glory Glory Glory brother brandom said in Israel and a church I believe there's a church on its road now it Road tonight a power of the Living God that men will speak the word here and there and it'll flash like lightning and a church is coming out not a psychologist not some of this put on make believe but a real true genuine anointed Holy Ghost called out church that's the church that sees Jesus and say what we see should put our souls into action to make a church that will make a Revival Hall Hallelujah glory to God oh hallelujah hallelujah positioned in Christ is that right waiting God trying to place his church in position to manifest himself getting one that he could work through there's my spirit throwing freely there it is I can work here get another one over there and place him I can place him adoption and place in manifesting take him out here and put a ceremony in him visit him with an angel tell him something now if he's told the truth now he just making something up it won't work that won't work we've had a lot of that but I mean manifestations of sons of God when God manifests himself and he sends them out then he goes forth and what he says is truth what he does is truth what he does he manifests Christ can the church say Amen oh Hallelujah can we give the Lord a shout of praise the devil thought he had you but you're still standing the devil thought you're finished but you're still standing you're supposed to be back sitting but here you are you should have given up a long time ago but here you are you're supposed to be sad but you're still standed and because of that the devil is shaken you're supposed to be dead and because of that the devil is shaken can the church say Amen s we would see Jesus Jesus Is Our Hope Jesus is our Banner Jesus is our strength Jesus is the possibility of a bride's Revival and like Samson we see a possibility can the church say Amen that we're going to have a Revival oh Hallelujah when you look what do you see we're getting ready to close out in a few minutes but brandom said listen in once more listen close now at this remark brother said he knew that his present backslid condition could never meet the challenge of the hour yet he was just as much man as he ever was in his muscles do you know when Moses was in Egypt he was the same man that was going to deliver the children of Israel God didn't not to add height to him God have to add Samson was the same Samson when the spirit was upon him and the spirit was it was the same man and the different was the spirit you know all of Samson's potential was always there you know all Joseph potential was always there God not put any potential now so all of the potential of who you are is already locked up in there you know God is not now choosing you he's not now predestinate in you everything that you have to be was already in seed form inside of [Music] you that's why but the branam can say you are not even the believer but the word in you is a Believer there's a seed in you that believes more than you believe and that seed is what brought you here tonight and that seed is waiting for the rain to fall because the moment the rain falls upon that seed that seed has to come to life and there's nothing we read at the beginning of the service that could stop the purpose of God not your job not your family not sickness not the doctor not even death could stop the powers of God because if you put down this body there's another body waiting for you because your seed is who you are that is who you are the real you can the church say Amen Give the Lord a shout of [Music] Praise And when you see that you start to look at their trials different and they start to see Jesus and he has changed like I said at the beginning not why is it happened to me and P me no why is it happen for me what is god pushing me away from what is god pushing me to why did God allow this to happen because if you can't forgive if you can't love if you can't have if you can't if you can't do these things you can't go over there because only perfect love will get you there and only people close to you could hurt you anybody with me this evening s we would see Jesus friends it's not just a phrase you know situations have to come to you so that we can see Jesus in you can I say that one more time [Music] we read that scripture with with uh Judas was there talking about the ointment but je but Judas was all the way to the whole Ministry and you couldn't tell that Jesus was treating Judas any different in so much and Judas was so well hidden that when Jesus asked the question or when Jesus told them one of you will will will betray me everybody they say Lord is it I it's not as if they say I feel I know who it is you know they could even say somebody I know his brother so and so been acting funny you know when Jesus said one of you will betray me everybody said look at your lord is there something in me that I don't he said Lord is it I and when you ever get into that proximity with Jesus you stop looking at the person next to you you know he said Lord is it meall is it me have to fix something is there something because pressure does make people do things so you always know when somebody really meet Jesus you know because when you really meet he can never look at the person next to you because just like Isaiah when he come to the presence of God what he say who is me not his who is him so I given you a key for your own walk with God and when people going around with the pointing finger thing they say Jesus find me one place where Jesus publicly embarrass somebody and make them feel bad because of their sin s we would see Jesus that woman who was caught in the very Act of adultery and they say well look Jesus we about to Stone he said no problem no problem which of you without sin go ahead and cast it and Jesus look away from them so that they and all I feel bad and by the time he turned back around brother M they gone he look at her now and say where are your accusers notice he say how much times you do the ACT how long you in this situation he said where are you accuser neither do I condemn thee go and sin no more s we would see Jesus you know what situations we have faced with in this year 2024 that if Jesus was in the room overseeing the administration of the situation it would be different we need to see Jesus how many times we have spoken to our ch children a certain way and if Jesus who is the father treat his children a certain way what if we see some more of Jesus I always talk about the way but Branham lived because but Branham knew Brothers in the church who couldn't handle ministers Oran and ministers who are WR the prophet who knew it say how brother Billy how you could treat him so you say hoping one day because Jesus was V Ed in that short brother from Kentucky say we would see Jesus how different we would deal with situations and family conflict and issues if Jesus was allowed permission to guide your words because that's still small voice is very much active you know but we tune it out but the brandham taught us your conscience and these things are designed to protect you but after a while for somebody to end up in your world brother mam said God doesn't send anybody to hell he said you run every red light to get there because God is trying to prevent you for making wrong decisions and every time you see and there's a red light he say you're making a choice to run the red light s we would see Jesus anybody with me tonight and I'll share this and I've Shar this before I know I supposed to be wrapping up but could we take a a more the prophet of God and I Shar it with young people a lot the prophet of God hung a cross in his car he left in 1965 we're going into 2025 and back then he hung across in his car so when he see the woman walking in the street and if you compare a picture of the woman in 1965 to 2025 the cross we need to put carit in the car the cross will be going out the left side door the right window that make a hole in the back of the car your car is a cross because times have changed but he is the same yesterday today and forever so there has to be something bigger than your intellect and your idea there has to be a change on the inside so that how you deal with life is Jesus in the driver's seat of your car not a quot or an understanding of the message but Jesus in full control you look in the mirror and Jesus looking back at you and something says I can't wear this this way because you know when people looking for you they ready need to see Jesus can the church say Amen am oh Hallelujah can we give the Lord a shout of Praise I'm trying to wrap up here you love the [Applause] Lord Brother brandham said here about something he knew his back seting condition could not be the challenge of the the music could get ready to come up so does the church know now we can do it under this this condition Hallelujah glory to God but there's a possibility Samson said he saw a possibility and I want to see Jesus as your possibility if you have not tried Jesus fully try him this time if you have not dedicated your entire year to him before there have been many all years night services but let this one be different Hallelujah we are in 2025 Happy New Year may the Lord bless you may he Prosper you may his faith shine upon you may he fill you with the baptism of the Holy Ghost and Fire may your cup run over in so much that those around you get blessed may it be for you and your house may he Grant every desire of your heart Hallelujah may you prosper may you conquer every gate that comes your way can the church say Amen oh Hallelujah brother Bram said Samson saw a possibility and may you see Jesus as your possibility for 2025 he said a he saw possibility that God will hear me friends what if God answers your prayer tonight what is your prayer and if God answers your prayer tonight what is that prayer tonight he saw a possibility that God will hear me he he said while he thought the Philistines had not noticed him while this little boy had untied his hands he walked say lay my hands upon the post there is a possibility I wish the church could see that there's a possibility of a real Revival there's a possibility of a holy ghost outpouring in your home there's a possibility brother Terence of your eyes popping open you've got to believe it there's a possibility of arthritis being healed completely there's a possibility of female condition being dissolved there's a possibility that the desires of your heart will be answered there's a possibility tonight that your backs son will be delivered there's a possibility tonight that your brother your sister that the house of Hell will give way to the name of Jesus there's a possibility that your husband will receive the baptism of the Holy Ghost there's a possibility tonight may this be your prayer may this be your Fai may this be your encouragement that 2020 25 every place a soul of your foot walk upon is yours I want you to claim whatever your heart desire is right now if it's your family Lord family Lord I claim them in this new year I claim my son I claim my daughter I claim my family I claim my health I claim restoration I claim Deliverance I claim it tonight I claim it in this year this year is my year you got to speak it you got to declare it your words are important declare it tonight I'm finished hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah oh Hallelujah Glory Glory Glory Glory brother bam said they never noticed the moving of his lips as he was sincerely confessing friends I want you to confess what is yours your confession you're claiming that's important to God but the brandham said they didn't notice when Samson's mouth began to move he was there in the middle of the Philistine camp and he was saying lord it's me and me in need of prayer Lord I'm ready to die with my Philistines and he began to cry once more lord butam said he raised up his sockets he had no eyes did never notice the moving of his lips as he was sincerely confessing Lord forgive me we need a sincere cleaning from the pulpit of the janitor they never noticed the tears running down from them sockets where he once had eyes they never noticed the moving of his lips his eyes Briny tears streaming down from the sockets he wanted God to make his word once more Vindicated to prove uh that he's the same yesterday today and forever once more he thought it would happen oh glory to God brother manam said Samson is speaking he said I've got off track I'm not worthy to live Lord let me die with this enemy You Raised Me Up to destroy it and I failed you Lord but there's a possibility you'd hear me once more Lord once more in dead Earnest he prayed he knowed what was coming oh come on now he had felt the presence of God before he knew that if God answer his prayer one more time he knew what that power would do he knew what was coming he said Lord just this one once more and this is my prayer for you for 2025 Lord you have P up before Lord you have moved before Lord you have delivered before Lord you have healed before now in 2025 just this once more once more let me see Jesus Christ as he was yesterday when he prayed that prayer and the tears rolling from his cheeks with deep sincerity of confession that's what the church needs confess your wrong don't care what Dr Jones says or what anybody else says if you're out of the word of God confess that you're wrong cry out once more Lord once more once more Lord once more avenge my blindness and give me strength he knew what was going to happen if his prayer was answered he knew dead Earnest crying once more Lord and while he was praying and making his honest confession every fiber in his body began to vibrate oh God if the body of Jesus Christ could stand as one and every fiber and every member begin to vibrate with the literal baptism of the Holy Ghost again not with new members and shaking hands and some Creed as the strength began to move into those big muscles every fiber began to twist he begin to feel himself again he began to feel himself again if you've been out of Fellowship this is your service if you've been out of Faith this is your service if you have been living outside of the Covenant this is your service tonight [Music] oh Hallelujah brother random said let me tell you something you had better destroy your enemy before your enemy destroys you bring back the oldfashioned prayer meetings real Godly repentance the allight altar service oh Pentecost hear me leave this corruption that Jezebel has worked among you leave it quickly and return back to the word of the Lord away from this Hollywood Showmanship turn with your whole heart back to the word of God turn back to the power of the Holy Ghost you women dress like women you men act like men like Sons and Daughters of God turn from this Jezebel system that's choking you oh Hallelujah I'm almost finished you don't have to leave here bound friends you don't have to leave here defeated brother brandham goes on he said he was aware what would happen if God answered his prayer if the church can only get into that condition if you are ready now if you're sincere if you really mean business if your eyes are open to what I'm trying to tell you in a roundabout way if you are sincere then say Lord I don't care what it is I'm ready Hallelujah Glory Glory Glory Glory Hallelujah Glory Glory Glory Glory let's stand to our feet give him praise Give Him
