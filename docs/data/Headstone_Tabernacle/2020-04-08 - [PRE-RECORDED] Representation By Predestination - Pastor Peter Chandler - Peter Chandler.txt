that couldn't read and write and place him as an apostle to the church who could figure it out where God bypassed the linen the well thought of people and get humble hearts that that he could use and to that end I'm so appreciative to be identified with the Brethren here I was sharing about a pizza and I'd scan over the ministers that I associate with and preach along with I have not seen one of them projecting themselves their church their ministries I see them Christ centered and Christ focus and insert remembers listen to me and encouragement to me and I would work with any man whether he have no see half see quarter seal six seals or whatever doesn't matter what he has or doesn't have but if the man of a heart came in brother John if that man have a heart for the kingdom of God I will

screen I said to brother Colin banner if put in can shake hands with Trump who can't shake hands with anybody we must be at the end time man amen praise be to God so the Lord richly bless you shall we stand to our feet as we go for a short time in the Word of God I meant a little message I brought to my church last Sunday it just took me about it over an hour with translation so we shall be too long today but we want to speak on a great subject called representation by three destinations while I'm going into it if I do this that by the Isaac knows that means to go on to the next slide I brought some little pictures as well because some young people come to me they say you know pasta those little pictures help me to kind of understand when you a picture says a thousand words you know so are you fine right through our do little pictures to kind of bring it home to help our little fellas to kind of get them to grab the inspiration let's go over to the scriptures brother Isaac and I think I can just read them from here a few directional scriptures there and you will say to me yes they're well-known but sometimes you can do something you know it well but then some one day the fire strikes it amen and it just becomes alive so st. Luke 10 remembering the subject representation by predestination Luke 2010 20 if you join me there notwithstanding in this rejoice not that that the spirits are subject to you I mean that's wonderful but rather rejoice because your names are written in heaven Romans 8:15 for ye have not received the spirit of bondage again to fear but you have received the spirit of adoption whereby we cry Abba Father amen and verse 29 of the same chapter goes on to say for whom he did foreknow also did he did predestinate to be conformed to the image of his son but he might be the firstborn among many brethren jumping to verse 30 moreover whom he did predestinate them he also caught whom he called he justified and whom he justified them he also glorified my and finally Ephesians 1:5 and in a beautiful scripture for today having predestinated us unto the adoption of children by Jesus Christ to himself according to the good pleasure of his will the church said a man let us bow our heads gracious Almighty God I just feel so happy today just to be gathered Lord as the pastor has mentioned that holy convocation Lord and how brother Branham has centered Lord this great promise right in our day their God that we may know what we have been called unto their God we thank you to be gathered in this way dear God Lord because you said where the carcass is the Eagles will be gathered there there God we give you glory and praise and may you bless every heart today those on line two may they be blessed as we bring nothing new but just Lord what the the prophet has already brought you are living in the days of the voice of the seventh angel the Prophet himself may be gone but his voice is still here their God we thank you now bless that these few words to us we give you praise and glory in Jesus Christ's name Amen and amen you may be seated everybody god bless you richly hallelujah I want to greet all the ministers that will speak and if I don't get to call all your names forgive me if I just reach you collectively but my respect for each one is is colossal amen like to greet every minister as well that might have traveled far or near wherever I love you I respect you and I thank God for you because there's a great job that lies ahead of us and we're gonna do it by the grace of God amen hallelujah representation by predestination hallelujah and I put a beautiful picture there of a flying eagle because we are not in this age of the spirit of man hallelujah we are we are flying Eagles now hallelujah flying Eagles it is predestination when you're ready brother Isaac I said I'm just gonna hit the main points here you will be blessed by the words of the Prophet as he says election looks back to foreknowledge and predestination looks to destiny says don't forget that when brother Branham says don't forget that that means don't forget that when you're feeling low don't forget that when somebody talks about you don't forget that when things go wrong don't forget hallelujah a man he says election looks back here I was a couple bird born shape in iniquity speaking lies born among sinners about whole family sinners I was a cocklebur suddenly I'm a wheat grain what's all this election hallelujah we can't boast nobody can say I'm bigger than you you're smaller than me brother branham said never see yourself bigger than someone else we are all predestinated hallelujah glory to God thank you Jesus god is great amen when you're ready brother Isaac he says what is it this is the gospel of your salvation he says what was the salvation he was trying to tell them what was it what was the gospel what when we go on the streets to preach what is the gospel what is your salvation predestination from before the foundation of the earth is that right adoptions of sons predestined to eternal life now after you come to eternal life you've been saved sanctified filled with the Holy Ghost now God wanted to place you positionally amen so that you can work for his kingdom and his glory isn't that great to know that when you preach the gospel to somebody you're telling them you are predestinated man hallelujah young people you are predestinated I don't care what you did yesterday God knew about that hallelujah God knows everything about your life you are predestinated to the adoption don't ask me how but you are gonna make it by the grace of God you are gonna be there hallelujah God is able God is able he's gonna bring you through I don't know my way I thought on my way he's gonna guide you he's gonna guide you hallelujah you are in his hands when you come to an obstacle to you it may be a surprise to God it is no surprise when Israel came to the Red Sea they all said what's going on here but it was no surprise to God God knew from the foundation of the world that the Red Sea was gonna be there he knew it was going to be there it was no surprise he said why cry we can go forward hallelujah it might be a surprise to you it's not a surprise to God he's gonna bring you through shout Amen somebody [Applause] Amen predestinated a man he said so this is that if you like we were seen we did not become seed by rebirth we were see come your shot we were see a man therefore were reborn for only the elect can be reborn for a man only the elect can be reborn we were seed that's the reason we could be quickened long seed there is nothing there to quicker there's nothing there they come to meeting that you're sitting nothing there hallelujah but inside of you there's something there before you were born God put something inside there hallelujah amen we can't explain it but we praise God for it Amen hallelujah amen amen if you put bubble gum in there the bubble gum will not grow you will not get a bubble gum tree hallelujah go over to thank you let's be seated but God said easy love was elective love that's what it God's love is about he says the proof of his love is election not because he gave you a a Lamborghini or he gave you a promotion or he gave you a big house on the beach that doesn't show God's love he loves you and he elected you hallelujah that's God's loan hallelujah that's why I praise him hey man I love him because he put my name on a book and there's no power there's no demon that can take my name out of that book my name is there for eternity your name is there for eternity hallelujah glory to God he says his love his love is proven by the fact they were chosen to salvation good amen he says because God no just go back a bit brother Isaac thank you he says through sanctification he may commit you to death like Paul it doesn't mean he doesn't love you he loves you he may commit you to suffering like job that is his prerogative he still loves you hallelujah he loves you can we clap our hands and shout amen glory to God hallelujah let's go brother Isaac a man says as many as I love as many as I love he says a man is all about we must never try to make Jesus the object of human love it's not about you loving him it's not about you say go I love him I can feel the Holy Ghost fire is here something for today brother Janos said glory amen Adam never said God God it was God who said Adam Adam Adam never looked for God God was looking for Adams that's his election that is his love we must never he says it isn't no it is the many he says no it is the many that our loved ones of God it is his love in question not ours hey man even if you can't love him he loves you anyway and he will increase your love amen amen amen go to the next one brother Isaac I'm enjoying this praise God thank you realize that you're doing my work for me that's the purpose of God according to election might stand not of works young people did you hear that not of works this is a message of grace hallelujah he says not of works according to election might stand he says this love is elective love it is his love for his elect and his love for them is a part from human merit for it says that the purpose of God stands in election before the two children was even born he said Jacob I have loved it's off I have hated this is the representation of predestination can we accept those hands god bless Rory we come from God we're going back to Raj hallelujah and all things work together for good to them that love the Lord a man hallelu let's go to the next one brother Isaac amen praise be to God look at this when Moses came to that burning bush the words spoke back to him hey man this is dynamic it spoke back to him listen carefully because of Moses what he already was a man he what he already was before he met the fire he was a proper child a man look at this now that anointing that he had in him that was on the inside he said when that happened when Moses came to that bush it anointed what he believed what an anointing something on the inside came out something on the inside was stimulated hallelujah because inside of Moses was something a man another person would just not see it they would not see the star but the wise men saw the stuff they would not see the doubt but trunks or the down hallelujah what can we say to these things I love him because he first loved me Amen it anoints us today my brother Colin brother as I looked at that CNN it gave me faith he said it alone so you can t see the momentarily if you want to he says here annoys us when we see we are

won't even reach there he said you watch that won't going to be long before Jesus comes somewhere between 86 and 26 jesus got a cup he says because I ain't gonna go all the way before Jesus comes it ain't gonna go all the way before Jesus comes because the lair this year Church was lukewarm neither warm neither hot it still had a little bit of blessing left in it Church we are the bride we know we're growing out of here we are leaving this world goodbye world I'm gone yes something brother Isaac when you're ready let's go there Amen here's a here's something for you to look at he says you never tell a Pentecostal that's sanctification all of it because he's seen the restoration of the gifts he ain't gonna believe that he's got more than that and that's that last Church age that we had the Bible says there'll be no more Church ages we know there's not going to be another church age the scripture says this church age the seven church ages how many seven but this to be a gathering of the people there's to be a gathering of the people see and here we are how many thought that there's no more Church ages they make us mrs. bride but there is to be a gathering of the people hallelujah do you know what when Eagles gather you know what you call it it's called a corn vacation when Eagles gather and I believe we're at a convocation now and it's the holy convocation shout I mean somebody praise be to God even when you're ready for the Isaac he said this is the eighth day say brother Branham you've got all your 7 now let's take the last feast which is the Feast of Tabernacles since 7 days shall you offer by fire he says unto the Lord on the eighth day shall be a holy convocation and somebody will say oh that's back in Leviticus that's back way back thousands of years ago but brother Branham never left it in Leviticus brother Branham they said there is another holy time coming hallelujah that I read right there is another holy time coming hallelujah hallelujah another holy time is going to be here who said so that prophecy says glory to God he says there's going to be a holy convocation and you shall offer an offering made by fire unto the Lord who wants to offer a hallelujah made by fire I said who was to offer a hallelujah made by fire can you say Amen made by fire can you sell glory made by fire praise the Lord hallelujah let's go on aim and find your system you ought to when you're ready for the eyes that praise be to God he says how by the eternal one that came and redeemed and take us back letting us recognize that we were a part of this how do you know that you are a part because the word of the hour the promise of the day what is it it's a restoration back to the first day when you hit seven you have to go back to one because seven is completion you've got to go right back to one back to the first day and the fathers and the restoration of the Pentecostal genuine not sensations he says the same light has showed in the morning light as promised for the day amen and amen Charlie man somebody let's go in further now if you are a represent somebody telling my title somebody tell me representation of if you are a representation up here in this attribute of God if you have it you are represented here you know which part of the book you're in you are represented here you you are in the eternal which explains why people can't understand you they can't understand you you are part of the eternal by the baptism of the Holy Ghost hallelujah you're included in this praise better gone carry on brother Isaac let's go this is getting so sweet here it says in fact let me tell you something else you stand as if you never sinned in the first place because when you enter eternity you go before you sing hallellujah hallellujah when you enter eternity you enter before you even committed the sin glory to God so you stand so you never sinned in the first place you the blood of Jesus Christ hallelujah Amen let's give God a clap and a praise with you I'm loving this product a men glory of God thank you Jesus yes let's count amen amen what happens to the plant it says spoke what's next tassel what's next shucks there so that's one two three then grain comes out of that he says the three stages of it till it gets to the grain three stages of it till it gets to the grain praise God exactly God 4 indicates that he says the predestinated is the only one that's considered in the redemption hallelujah because redemption means bring back hallelujah so when you get to the grain it's not something new it goes back to the original the Alpha becomes the Omega hallelujah the predestinated is considered in the in the the predestination in the Redemption next our brother Isaac let's go through this nicely she's the heart has to be clean like brother Jana was saying he says he said before God can come down in the person of the Holy Ghost which is Christ coming down and dwelling in the human heart this is beyond Pentecost this is beyond the camp this is beyond speaking in tongues the fire is just yet too clean to make it clean let's go to the next one brother Isaac we're moving quickly now amen he says listen you become a new person not just an old one patched up by joining church and turning a new page just know God takes the old man and burns him completely it sends down your your your hallelujah he sends down your representation no man can come except my father drawed him and all the father has given me will come unto me hallelujah that's why you're here tonight has been disclosed hands we're gonna move on hallelujah praise the Lord oh I'm feeling really good today amen I feel like something's going on praise be to God what am i doing be seated everybody we've got to get rid of this fear we've got to get rid of this fear amen too much perhaps too much fear people fear that loss then they fear they're not gonna go to him but the BAM said look you are secure you're eternally secure you can be at peace you can be at peace you don't have to be worried hallelujah I heard a story just the other day a man a conversation between a wave and the sea and the wave you know the way it spoke to the sea and said oh you're so big I want to be like you I'm just a wave but you are the big sea advise me what must I do advise me what must I do I'm just a wave and the sea said wave if you want to be like me the first thing you have to do is calm down calm down and we can combat it I'm predestinated my life is in the book Satan you card you can't stop me hallelujah we're not running here and running there we are stable we are several shouting in somebody you like that one amen praise God let's go on to the next one brother Isaac praise be to God I mean let's go into somebody tell me the title there what's it called let's go back now to Adam because Adam caused this whole thing were you there when Adam sinned you see he did it he did it you know you but you were affected you came under that representation and through condemnation if that's all right shout Amen to me Amen many times I've heard people say listen brother branham Adam and Eve did the evil and that's just true the hybrid the Word of God that's true they reasoned and calls us to get into this condition it's good God is unjust if he condemns me I never did that brother better it was Adam not sinned I was born in shape a shape in iniquity somebody represented me amen and here's a thought he says you're condemned because Adam condemned you and condemned the world that's fair comment that is condemnation by representing thank God it doesn't stop there let's go one more brother Isaac amen he says you are a sinner by representation amen you're a sinner by representation he hold but he says he does he doesn't hold you responsible for being a sinner but he holds you responsible because you don't help yourself because there's a way being made for you and if you reject that way then God condemns you let's go on brother Isaac there's a way May sorry this is a shock of a picture but let's be shot that Christ has died for us he says Adam and Eve represented me as a sinner but Jesus came to represent us also they are under another representation the representation of the last Adam which is Jesus Christ hallelujah he came to represent us - amen let's go on brother Isaac hallelujah he says he says now you that says it's wrong to be represented by Adam as a sinner what about representation we have salvation the same way Adam condemned us Christ has justified us if we accept the way that's been made God's only provided way how are we ever gonna be saved one come to represent us and his name is G he came to represent us before God as sons and daughters of God he sent His Holy Spirit hallelujah but if you don't help yourself then he then God condemns you but if you receive this way he will bless you let's go on brother Isaac he says now he says you talk about a Jubilee you talk about a time when that lamb walked forth because he is our representative everybody was waiting John was weeping because there was no representative but then his representative came out let's go there Eliza amen he says the first thing that represented Kamisha represented that Redemption was the lamb that had been slain from the foundation of the world he was the kinsman redeemer can we all shout kinsman redeemer he was not the kinsman reformer he was up a king's man legalist hey man he was not the Kings man preacher he was the kinsman redeemer and he's going to redeem her young people he's gonna redeem you let's clap those hands and shout amen he's trying to redeem you hallelujah hey man and joy he took the book glory a man and he opened the book and he tore off the seals amen and sent it down to the earth to his seventh angel to reveal it to his people hallelujah he was how representation no man was worthy no man was worthy to read the book no man was worthy to even touch the book but Jesus was our representation by predestination hallelujah hallelujah let's go fellows like a man came in and brother when we get up there I tell you I thought I put this in brother over it is so sweet over here every minister will stand on his ministry with his congregation and the question will be asked a man they say that the angel that was speaking said whirlpool after stand - said yes he said I know I'm all right because I've preached the same word that Paul has preached and when I did that millions screamed out that's where we're resting that's where we're resting and church let me tell you I'm arresting in the representation of predestination provided by Jesus Christ and that is the word of God whenever that prophet said I believe it hallelujah with all of my heart amen amen let's move on praise be to God let's see a man he says God don't hold you responsible for being a sinner he won't hold you responsible from now on but he holds you responsible if you reject this when these guys start to criticize the cloud criticize the Prophet I feel sorry because they're playing with fire hallelujah this is God's provided way this is God's provided representation through this message you can make it this message can take all of Adam out of your life but if you reject it you are finished brother I'm gonna stand with this message I'm gonna stand right here I'm resting on this the Prophet said it I believe it that settles it amen praise be to God [Applause] hallelujah let's go up on Isaac praise be to God hallelujah it takes something to flash across that in 1975 somebody gave me serpent seed something flash tomorrow the deepest message you can ever have but I said thank you Jesus this man is speaking the truth something in me flashed the word flashed across me it doesn't take long just a few seconds and you recognize how many knows what recognize means it means you've seen it before you've seen it before where were you in the sons of God shouted for joy and the morning stars sang together where were you we've seen you before glory we know each other and we know the kinsman redeemer a man something flashed across that seed the seed of God from the foundation of the world amen amen now I'm starting to feel good by the film Amen he says there was a woman she was what we call a bad girl she was a bad girl but there was something inside her somebody tell me my title today is somebody shot back to me hallelujah she was bad she was bad she was a prostitute amen but when the light struck her quickly she recognized it because there was something in there to respond to it where there's a deep deep calling there's a deep deep to respond hallelujah oh God doesn't care about your condition where there's representation but predestination it's more powerful than all those things it's more powerful it's more powerful hallelujah let's go pal Isaac Amen praise be to God but the priest he was the good guy he was the good guy huh he says this priest he says we find his bottom part is back life behind him his predestination is sinful this little part here looks like the back it represents his purity he was a priest he was an honorable man everything he said you couldn't be a priest except being an honorable man but yet when he met Jesus he said he's busy Bob and he criticized Jesus but when this bad girl met him she said come see a man that told me everything hallelujah young people take courage there's something in you it is representational ouya he says this to a prostitute she had nothing to present she was filthy and dirty as she could be but notice way down inside of her she's got representation [Applause] new destination yes you're looking for this to be made flesh when she said go get your husband yes sir I have none and the conversation carried on let's go brother Isaac a man he says what happened you didn't have to explain it she saw it she thought young people doesn't take two weeks three weeks the same night you're gonna be saying I see it I see I'm free I'm represented by Jesus Christ hey man I've represented by predestination he says he says why he didn't get the priest cuz there was nothing there he had no representation but she had eternal life praise be to God hallelujah are we seeing their ever going now let's go to the next one I forget where it is amen he says there it is there's the world it's just no matter how scholar he was or anything like that he still didn't have representation of predestination he didn't have that he says to look it proves predestination said if you got eternal life you have to be a part of God because he's the only one that is eternal see oh my think of it it should make a Presbyterian shout hallelujah hey man let's go to the next part here but Isaac a man he said representation from predestination he says it he says if she hadn't had representation from that predestination it would never have taken over he said there stood the priest he said this man is Beelzebub say you have see you have eternal life it's only one form of it you were his contributing he sort of here he knowed you before the foundation of the world in his mind do you see a man let's go and buy the Isaac we're not gonna stay too long here he says oh my he says no matter you get some people they've got predestination you can't stop them every service they come to the altar
