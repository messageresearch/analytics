[1:02:13] pray a special blessing on the believers
[1:02:15] that they would be in the spirit
[1:02:17] and in the atmosphere and they would
[1:02:19] declare their homes to be holy ground
[1:02:21] and they will

[1:02:50] of jesus christ
[1:02:52] and the church says amen and amen so i'd
[1:02:56] like to greet you this morning
[1:02:58] in the precious theme of jesus christ
[1:03:00] it's certainly a great privilege
[1:03:02] to be in the house of the lord and to be
[1:03:06] in fellowship there's no audience here
[1:03:09] this morning
[1:03:10] so but we know that we are connected by
[1:03:14] faith we are connected by the revelation
[1:03:16] we are connected by the word
[1:03:18] we are connected by the covenant we are
[1:03:20] connected by our predestination
[1:03:23] we are connected by our destination we
[1:03:25] are connected
[1:03:26] by the one who called us the one who
[1:03:29] preserved us
[1:03:30] and it is in times like these when
[1:03:33] uh nobody else could really see us and
[1:03:35] we are in our homes and we
[1:03:37] are struggling to deal with the changes
[1:03:39] of this world and
[1:03:41] and the whole pandemic and these things
[1:03:43] that we ought to be certain of god
[1:03:45] our faith cannot rest uh in in
[1:03:49] in ourselves our fate cannot rest on the
[1:03:51] church building our faith has to rest on
[1:03:53] almighty god so
[1:03:55] i'm here this morning by faith i
[1:03:57] torbered over it i wasn't feeling too
[1:03:59] well the last few days but
[1:04:00] i'm at my post of duty this morning
[1:04:03] looking to see god do something for us
[1:04:05] and to speak to us
[1:04:07] through his word because the word comes
[1:04:09] for us to be
[1:04:10] changed and to be transformed and i know
[1:04:13] it's been a real blessing uh the
[1:04:14] services
[1:04:15] the last few services that would have
[1:04:17] administered and truly truly
[1:04:19] truly a blessing to my soul and i pray
[1:04:21] that
[1:04:22] uh this morning god will do something
[1:04:24] for us as well so if you have your
[1:04:25] bibles
[1:04:27] would you turn with me uh to one
[1:04:30] portion of scripture reading from
[1:04:32] hebrews
[1:04:34] chapter 9 and reading from verse 24 this
[1:04:38] morning
[1:04:39] hebrews 9 and verse 24.
[1:04:51] for christ is not entered into the holy
[1:04:54] places made with hands
[1:04:57] which are the figures of the true
[1:05:01] in other words uh for christ has entered
[1:05:05] not
[1:05:05] into holy places made with hands
[1:05:09] which are the copies of the true
[1:05:13] but into heaven itself now to appear in
[1:05:16] the presence of god
[1:05:18] for us know yet that he should offer
[1:05:21] himself often
[1:05:23] as the high priest entered into the holy
[1:05:25] place every year
[1:05:26] with blood of others for then must he
[1:05:29] often have suffered since the foundation
[1:05:32] of the world but now once in the end
[1:05:34] of the world had he appeared to put away
[1:05:37] sin
[1:05:37] for the sacrifice of himself and as
[1:05:41] it is appointed unto men once to die
[1:05:44] but after this the judgment so christ
[1:05:47] was once offered to bear the sins of
[1:05:49] many
[1:05:50] and unto them that look for him
[1:05:54] shall he appear the second time without
[1:05:56] sin
[1:05:57] unto salvation may the lord add a
[1:05:59] blessing to the reading of his word
[1:06:02] you may be seated in your homes
[1:06:05] and uh robert really preached a
[1:06:07] tremendous message he has been on
[1:06:09] on on a road uh and he preached a
[1:06:12] message on wednesday night for those who
[1:06:14] love
[1:06:15] his appearing so i want to kind of
[1:06:18] connect to that now and take as a title
[1:06:20] this morning
[1:06:21] unto them that look for him
[1:06:24] so we're speaking unto them that look
[1:06:26] for him shall he appear the second time
[1:06:28] without sin
[1:06:29] unto salvation but unto them that look
[1:06:32] for him
[1:06:33] is the thought and the text this morning
[1:06:36] and uh brother branham had used that
[1:06:39] very same
[1:06:40] scripture that i read uh in a message
[1:06:43] that he preached called
[1:06:44] look you know and uh when you see what's
[1:06:47] happening and
[1:06:48] and you know it it takes a level of
[1:06:51] maturity to
[1:06:52] live above the situation and the
[1:06:54] circumstances
[1:06:55] but the world is looking for peace the
[1:06:57] world is looking for
[1:06:59] uh relief from the stress businesses are
[1:07:02] looking for
[1:07:02] a relief of the pandemic and these
[1:07:04] different things and but iran
[1:07:06] said in the message look now everybody
[1:07:08] is looking today
[1:07:09] everybody is looking for something and
[1:07:11] looking for something to happen
[1:07:14] so everybody is looking for something
[1:07:16] and looking for something to happen
[1:07:18] we know that the world is constantly
[1:07:20] watching the skies
[1:07:22] the radar and the screens and i can
[1:07:24] imagine somewhere there's some
[1:07:25] biologists or some
[1:07:27] doctor and he's studying china he's
[1:07:29] looking for a vaccine they're looking
[1:07:31] for a solution they're looking for some
[1:07:33] way
[1:07:33] to to to bring some relief to the world
[1:07:36] and and and man has every right to try
[1:07:39] to do what he wants to do there
[1:07:40] the radar and the screens that we have
[1:07:42] up around the nation every nation for
[1:07:44] its own defense whether branham said
[1:07:46] has got a magic eye looking to find
[1:07:48] something to appear
[1:07:50] into this screen like an atomic missile
[1:07:52] or something
[1:07:53] then they've got something there to go
[1:07:55] back to the one that's centered this way
[1:07:57] everything is looking
[1:07:59] and he's speaking in his context the
[1:08:01] ford company is looking to make a better
[1:08:03] ford
[1:08:03] the chevrolet is looking making a better
[1:08:06] chevrolet
[1:08:07] phoenix is looking to make a larger and
[1:08:09] better town
[1:08:10] the nation is looking for more territory
[1:08:12] so it can spread itself
[1:08:14] the church the church is looking for
[1:08:16] more members
[1:08:18] but the bride is looking for the coming
[1:08:20] of her lord
[1:08:21] and that's how i feel this morning we
[1:08:23] are looking for the coming
[1:08:25] of the lord we're not looking just to
[1:08:27] have church we
[1:08:28] don't even have it the way we would
[1:08:29] normally do but we are looking for the
[1:08:31] coming of the lord because we are
[1:08:32] getting ready to leave this place
[1:08:34] everything that's happening around us is
[1:08:36] for us to get ready
[1:08:38] to leave this place why this world is
[1:08:40] not our home
[1:08:41] we are just a passing through we are
[1:08:43] just walking through every day
[1:08:45] and we are trying to get back to where
[1:08:47] we were because man
[1:08:49] lost his way and we are working to get
[1:08:51] our way back can the church say amen
[1:08:54] so i want you to get in the spirit this
[1:08:56] morning i'm not
[1:08:58] going to be too long with you but i want
[1:09:00] to connect
[1:09:01] to individuals who are looking for him
[1:09:03] not just looking for a better job not
[1:09:05] just looking for a raise or pay
[1:09:08] not just looking to be a good church
[1:09:09] member not just looking to say i believe
[1:09:12] the message
[1:09:13] but looking unto him looking for him
[1:09:16] looking to him too many people are
[1:09:19] looking to the pastor too many people
[1:09:21] looking to the church but unto them that
[1:09:24] look for
[1:09:25] him unto them that look for him
[1:09:28] shall he appear so there are people who
[1:09:30] are in church
[1:09:31] who are members of the body and they are
[1:09:34] not looking to him
[1:09:35] they are just coming and they're just
[1:09:37] going and they're looking around but
[1:09:39] i'm speaking this morning to those that
[1:09:41] are looking unto him
[1:09:43] your eyes is fixed on him brother
[1:09:45] branham gave the example of that brass
[1:09:47] serpent
[1:09:48] he said if you look to the serpent then
[1:09:50] you got your healing so he said look
[1:09:52] and live so we want to be looking this
[1:09:54] morning
[1:09:55] not on the negativity we want to be
[1:09:57] looking this morning
[1:09:58] not on the bad news and what's happening
[1:10:01] but we want to look
[1:10:02] for him because when you look to him you
[1:10:04] get joy when you look to him
[1:10:05] you get hope when you look to him you
[1:10:07] get peace when you look to him
[1:10:09] it gets hallelujah oh joy unspeakable
[1:10:12] and full of glory
[1:10:14] when you look to him you see a
[1:10:15] possibility of what you didn't see
[1:10:17] before
[1:10:18] can the church say amen when you look to
[1:10:20] him
[1:10:21] you see him as he is you see him in the
[1:10:24] form of the holy spirit
[1:10:25] being present being real in your home
[1:10:29] real in your life can the church say
[1:10:31] amen
[1:10:33] so i'm encouraged this morning and i
[1:10:35] want to kind of connect a bit
[1:10:37] to the last message i preached about
[1:10:38] have we done enough
[1:10:40] because if you're looking for him then
[1:10:42] you're supposed to be making
[1:10:43] preparations
[1:10:44] anybody with me this morning if you're
[1:10:46] looking to him
[1:10:47] then it means that you are supposed to
[1:10:49] be putting things in place because your
[1:10:51] focus
[1:10:52] is him and it is so easy to lose focus
[1:10:56] in such a time as this and i realize all
[1:10:58] the news
[1:10:59] and all that's happening around us is to
[1:11:01] distract us from looking
[1:11:03] on to him can the church say amen you
[1:11:06] get
[1:11:07] caught up in this thing and and you're
[1:11:08] sending messages around about the virus
[1:11:11] and about this and about that
[1:11:12] and and at the end of the day you get so
[1:11:15] heavy and so
[1:11:16] anxious and all these things but that's
[1:11:18] the trick of the devil
[1:11:19] to keep your eyes away from him but when
[1:11:22] you look only to him
[1:11:24] then everything else begins to lose
[1:11:26] meaning everything else begins to lose
[1:11:28] priority everything else that began to
[1:11:30] stress you
[1:11:31] began to fall apart abraham was not
[1:11:34] looking at his condition
[1:11:35] abraham was not looking at sarah's
[1:11:37] condition abraham was looking to him
[1:11:40] abraham was looking to the promise
[1:11:43] abraham was looking to the word
[1:11:45] and as believers if there ever was a
[1:11:47] time for us to look to the word of god
[1:11:49] it's this time
[1:11:50] if there ever was a time to look to what
[1:11:53] the promise of god for this age is
[1:11:55] it is this time now and that's how i
[1:11:58] feel this morning
[1:11:59] that's my motivation to be here this
[1:12:01] morning because it's later than we think
[1:12:04] but our eyes this morning are fixed on
[1:12:06] him
[1:12:07] our eyes are focused on him and we are
[1:12:10] not going to go back
[1:12:11] we are not going to turn back we are not
[1:12:13] going to give up
[1:12:14] we are going to stay focused just like
[1:12:16] elijah and elisha
[1:12:18] he said if you see me go you're going to
[1:12:20] have what you asked for
[1:12:22] and the church say amen so that same
[1:12:25] focus
[1:12:25] is what we are talking about because
[1:12:28] only unto them that look for him
[1:12:30] hallelujah there are many people they're
[1:12:33] looking at words
[1:12:34] or they're looking at the books and
[1:12:35] they're looking at the tapes and he is
[1:12:37] not in the picture
[1:12:39] but we're talking about looking to him
[1:12:40] this morning and when you look at him
[1:12:42] and when you see him you see the
[1:12:44] promises for your home
[1:12:46] you see the promises for your family you
[1:12:48] see the possibility
[1:12:50] not just the possibility but the reality
[1:12:52] that you're going to be healed
[1:12:54] that you're going to be delivered that
[1:12:55] you're going to be adopted
[1:12:57] you're going to be perfected that you're
[1:12:59] going to grow up
[1:13:00] into a son of authority can the church
[1:13:03] say amen
[1:13:05] oh hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah
[1:13:09] oh so there has to be a way because if
[1:13:12] you're looking to him
[1:13:13] there has to be a way for him to
[1:13:15] identify i want you to catch this now if
[1:13:18] you are looking to him
[1:13:19] there has to be a way for him to
[1:13:21] identify
[1:13:23] who is looking to him because that's the
[1:13:25] only way he could appear to those and
[1:13:27] look for him can the church say amen
[1:13:29] so we are talking about that connection
[1:13:32] between you
[1:13:33] looking to him and him appearing to you
[1:13:35] there has to be some way
[1:13:37] for him to know who's looking at him
[1:13:39] we're not talking about physical eyes
[1:13:41] now
[1:13:42] but we're talking about looking to him
[1:13:44] and looking to his word
[1:13:45] and if you see his word his word should
[1:13:48] get you
[1:13:48] into action and that's where we're going
[1:13:50] this morning
[1:13:51] because when you look to him it puts you
[1:13:54] into action
[1:13:55] that's the only way he could know you're
[1:13:58] looking at him
[1:13:59] because he is the word and he is the
[1:14:02] spirit
[1:14:02] so our focus as believers now
[1:14:06] more than ever is to look at him as word
[1:14:09] and to see him as spirit and when word
[1:14:12] and spirit comes together
[1:14:14] something has got to happen can the
[1:14:16] church say amen
[1:14:18] glory even when jesus was on the earth
[1:14:22] oh john told them go find out are you
[1:14:24] the one
[1:14:25] or should we look for another they knew
[1:14:28] that somebody was coming
[1:14:29] they knew that something was going to
[1:14:31] happen oh glory to god
[1:14:33] and all these years we have been in the
[1:14:35] message we know
[1:14:37] something is about to happen it has not
[1:14:39] been for us to
[1:14:40] have church all these years that's not
[1:14:42] the objective
[1:14:43] the objective is not for us to be good
[1:14:45] church members
[1:14:46] the objective is for him to be able to
[1:14:49] appear
[1:14:50] a personal visitation to you oh
[1:14:53] hallelujah somebody say man
[1:14:56] no turning back hallelujah from the
[1:14:59] messenger token
[1:15:00] but god sent back the holy ghost that's
[1:15:03] the token
[1:15:04] was upon the human in the human's heart
[1:15:07] and that
[1:15:07] is your identification that you have
[1:15:11] accepted god's plan
[1:15:13] meant jehovah's requirements so in other
[1:15:15] words those that look into him
[1:15:17] they are the ones who will come in
[1:15:19] contact with the token not those who are
[1:15:21] looking at their circumstances
[1:15:23] not those who are looking at their
[1:15:24] situations not those who are looking at
[1:15:26] their problems
[1:15:27] not those who are looking at the
[1:15:29] opposition but those who look at the
[1:15:31] word for this day
[1:15:32] can the church say amen and that's the
[1:15:35] identification
[1:15:37] he met them for you at calvary and you
[1:15:40] have met them on your
[1:15:41] knees god has given you the token sign
[1:15:44] and return of the spirit was upon christ
[1:15:47] is in you
[1:15:48] and a guarantee identification of his
[1:15:51] life
[1:15:52] death burial and resurrection and a lie
[1:15:55] forevermore
[1:15:56] now in the believing church amen it's a
[1:15:59] positive token
[1:16:00] a token sign and we know when that token
[1:16:04] is applied
[1:16:05] when i see the blood when i see the
[1:16:07] token
[1:16:08] i'll pass over you when i see the token
[1:16:11] the play can come nigh you when i see
[1:16:14] the token
[1:16:15] hallelujah glory to god blessed be the
[1:16:18] name of the lord i can't hear you shout
[1:16:21] him
[1:16:21] but shout in your homes shout wherever
[1:16:23] you are
[1:16:24] right now lift your hands and give god
[1:16:26] praise give god glory
[1:16:28] because this is our time this is our
[1:16:30] season
[1:16:31] oh i feel like that that blind
[1:16:33] bartimaeus
[1:16:35] who couldn't see jesus but he lift his
[1:16:37] voice and say
[1:16:38] son of david have mercy on me he was not
[1:16:41] next to jesus
[1:16:42] but he was in the spirit he knew that
[1:16:44] jesus
[1:16:45] oh hallelujah could meet his need
[1:16:48] even though he had no eyes he was
[1:16:51] looking to jesus
[1:16:52] oh come on now even though he couldn't
[1:16:54] see him with his natural eyes
[1:16:56] he was looking to jesus and jesus
[1:16:58] appeared unto him
[1:17:00] oh blessed be the name of the lord and
[1:17:02] that is your promise to dave
[1:17:04] if you look on his word if you look on
[1:17:06] his promises
[1:17:08] if you look at the fact that every
[1:17:10] promise belongs to us
[1:17:12] every promise spoken in scripture that
[1:17:14] could not have been filled
[1:17:16] be it been fulfilled before this time
[1:17:18] it's for us to pick it up
[1:17:19] and for us to live it us to walk with it
[1:17:22] us to manifest it
[1:17:24] can the church say amen and the
[1:17:26] situations
[1:17:28] and the trials and what's happening
[1:17:30] around us
[1:17:31] is to create an environment for the
[1:17:34] world to be made manifest
[1:17:36] i'll say that one more time the
[1:17:37] situations and the trials
[1:17:40] and the tests and what's happening
[1:17:41] around us is to create the environment
[1:17:44] for the world to be made manifest
[1:17:47] situations have to come
[1:17:49] so that god could be proven situations
[1:17:51] have to come
[1:17:52] so you can exercise exercise the sea
[1:17:56] that's inside of you
[1:17:57] don't let the devil knock you out don't
[1:17:59] let the devil depress you
[1:18:01] don't let the devil frustrate you but
[1:18:03] lift up your head this morning
[1:18:05] and look to jesus because your
[1:18:07] redemption draw it nigh
[1:18:09] your hope draw it nigh your peace draw
[1:18:11] at nigh
[1:18:12] hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah blessed
[1:18:16] be
[1:18:16] the name of the lord oh hallelujah
[1:18:20] going on in the token the blood was the
[1:18:23] token that jehovah's requirements had
[1:18:25] been met in this house
[1:18:27] hallelujah so when you look to jesus
[1:18:30] and you are preparing for jesus i want
[1:18:32] to make the point now
[1:18:33] when you're looking for jesus you're
[1:18:35] looking to jesus
[1:18:36] you are expecting his appearing and you
[1:18:39] want him to appear
[1:18:40] to you and you want him to feel
[1:18:41] comfortable to come to you
[1:18:43] you want him to be welcome to come to
[1:18:45] you you cannot
[1:18:46] operate the same way that you have
[1:18:48] operated there has to be a change
[1:18:51] because he is holy so we must walk holy
[1:18:54] he is righteous so we must become
[1:18:56] righteous
[1:18:57] he hallelujah hallelujah there has to be
[1:19:00] a compatibility
[1:19:01] he must be able to say flesh of my flesh
[1:19:04] spirit of my spirit
[1:19:06] bone of my bone oh that's why
[1:19:09] he can only come unto them now look for
[1:19:11] him because this is a group of people
[1:19:13] it's not the majority
[1:19:15] it's the minority who are making
[1:19:17] preparations
[1:19:18] they are doing everything they are doing
[1:19:21] all that they could do
[1:19:22] they asked themselves the question have
[1:19:24] i done enough is there more to do
[1:19:26] because jesus is coming
[1:19:28] oh brother branham said if a celebrity
[1:19:30] or somebody important
[1:19:31] is coming to your house you will make
[1:19:34] preparations for it
[1:19:35] hallelujah are you making preparations
[1:19:37] to leave this place
[1:19:39] are you making preparations to leave
[1:19:40] this world behind
[1:19:42] are you making preparations in your
[1:19:44] daily walk
[1:19:45] are you making preparations in your
[1:19:47] daily talk nobody can see you but you're
[1:19:49] making preparations
[1:19:50] you can't fellowship the way you used to
[1:19:52] but you're making preparations
[1:19:54] every day you say lord i want to be
[1:19:56] ready and you are making the adjustments
[1:19:59] come the church say amen oh give the
[1:20:01] lord a shout out praise so that when
[1:20:04] i see the token i'll pass over you when
[1:20:07] the token is there show the price see
[1:20:09] the blood

[1:20:12] death when i see the blood
[1:20:13] i'll know the debt price has been made
[1:20:16] so i'll pass
[1:20:18] over you oh hallelujah blessed be the
[1:20:22] name of the lord i want to share this
[1:20:24] but abandonment saying the other day i
[1:20:25] was telling someone
[1:20:27] little donovan words here i guess you
[1:20:29] all know him i was hunting with him poor
[1:20:31] little fellow
[1:20:32] he's a nice little guy he comes here to
[1:20:34] church
[1:20:35] just a very good friend of mine and he
[1:20:37] said didn't want to bother you
[1:20:39] i looked and his ear turned all the way
[1:20:42] inside out
[1:20:43] and i said how are you donovan just took
[1:20:46] him by the hand like that on a cancer
[1:20:48] and i said donovan what's the matter
[1:20:49] with your ear
[1:20:51] he said don't know brother branham about
[1:20:53] six seven months and
[1:20:54] it just keeps getting i said why didn't
[1:20:57] you say something about it
[1:20:59] he said i didn't want to bother you
[1:21:01] brother branham i said do you know what
[1:21:03] it is he said i have no idea
[1:21:05] and brother adam said i just put my hand
[1:21:07] on him
[1:21:08] never said a word hallelujah two days
[1:21:12] after that
[1:21:13] there wasn't even a scar oh
[1:21:16] my my mind let me read that one more
[1:21:17] time he said i just put my hand
[1:21:20] on over him never said a word
[1:21:23] two days after that there wasn't even a
[1:21:26] scar
[1:21:27] what is it and this is what i want to
[1:21:29] get to friends
[1:21:30] because when you are looking to him
[1:21:33] there has to be a power that connects
[1:21:34] you
[1:21:35] and brother branham said it's the
[1:21:36] quickening power oh
[1:21:38] hallelujah and that's what i'm looking
[1:21:40] for is the quickening
[1:21:42] power oh that's what keeping you alive
[1:21:45] the quickening power is what brings the
[1:21:47] seed in your soul to life
[1:21:49] so if you're feeling kind of low this
[1:21:51] morning you need a quickening power
[1:21:53] to come into your soul you need a
[1:21:55] quickening power
[1:21:56] to come into your home you need a
[1:21:58] quickening power
[1:22:00] to come all over you and all your
[1:22:03] down feeling kind of get changed because
[1:22:05] the seed in you
[1:22:06] you didn't now put that seed there that
[1:22:08] seed has been there all along
[1:22:10] oh give the lord a shout of praise that
[1:22:12] seed has been there all along
[1:22:14] but what that seed needs is the
[1:22:16] quickening power
[1:22:17] oh lord send the quicken in power this
[1:22:20] morning
[1:22:20] send the anointing this morning see
[1:22:23] listen to the prophet
[1:22:25] it will quicken your mortal body his air
[1:22:28] would eat off his brains would have gone
[1:22:30] see he'd have died
[1:22:31] but the quickening power see oh
[1:22:34] hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah

[1:23:02] look over the curtain
[1:23:03] and i seen all of you over there uh-huh

[1:23:06] he said all that you ever loved and all
[1:23:10] loved you their gift to you see i seen
[1:23:13] them all over there like that
[1:23:14] what was it quickening power john the
[1:23:18] revelator
[1:23:19] was filled full of quickening power that
[1:23:22] stood up and seen the end from the
[1:23:24] beginning
[1:23:25] isaiah was full of quickening power and
[1:23:28] stood up and seen the millennium and
[1:23:30] all quickening power if the quickening
[1:23:33] power
[1:23:33] will make them see what they saw if the
[1:23:36] quickening power
[1:23:37] will make them feel how they felt if the
[1:23:40] quickening power
[1:23:41] will make them walk how they walked if
[1:23:43] the quickening power
[1:23:44] will make them shout how they shouted if
[1:23:46] the quickening power
[1:23:48] will make them turn the way they dance
[1:23:50] then i won that quickening power
[1:23:52] oh the letter kill it but the spirit
[1:23:54] gave it life
[1:23:55] i want the quickening power all over me
[1:23:58] i want the qriket and power in my
[1:24:00] soul i want the quickening power in my
[1:24:02] heart i want the quickening power
[1:24:04] to be able to move free into my life but
[1:24:07] iran said if the spirit
[1:24:09] that raised up christ from the dead
[1:24:11] dwell in you it will quicken
[1:24:13] your mortal body so that spirit
[1:24:16] has to dwell in you and if that spirit
[1:24:19] is in you it will quicken
[1:24:21] this mortal body it'll take over this
[1:24:24] mortal body
[1:24:25] it'll transform this mortal body
[1:24:28] i tell you you have a body change coming
[1:24:31] oh
[1:24:32] that gray hair is going to go black that
[1:24:34] ball is going to be reversed
[1:24:36] that ad right is going to be dissolved
[1:24:38] what will it be the quickening power
[1:24:40] that female condition has to be reversed
[1:24:43] because it was not so from the beginning
[1:24:46] when god placed man on the earth he was
[1:24:48] a perfect man
[1:24:49] but the fall of man separated man from
[1:24:52] that perfection
[1:24:54] but god created a way because even
[1:24:56] though man
[1:24:57] fell the seed in him could not fall
[1:25:00] because the seed was an eternal seed and
[1:25:03] that seed all these years
[1:25:05] has been waiting being moved in you to
[1:25:08] be connected with the quickening power
[1:25:10] because when the quicken and power
[1:25:12] connect with the seed it can only do one
[1:25:14] thing
[1:25:15] bring the sea to life oh hallelujah
[1:25:19] oh blessed be the name of the lord
[1:25:22] so i'm looking to see individuals
[1:25:25] begin to break out because they begin to
[1:25:28] look to him
[1:25:29] and that in looking to him they begin to
[1:25:31] make preparations
[1:25:32] they begin to cry out they begin to seek
[1:25:35] him they begin to forget the world
[1:25:37] they begin to forget everything else
[1:25:39] they begin to look unto him
[1:25:41] and the more you see him the more you
[1:25:43] look at him
[1:25:44] the more you see his be his being the
[1:25:46] more you see his nature
[1:25:47] the more you see his attributes up the
[1:25:50] more you see what he looks like
[1:25:52] you see all about him and the more you
[1:25:54] look at him
[1:25:55] is the more you can dress yourself the
[1:25:57] more you look at him
[1:25:58] is the more you can adjust yourself the
[1:26:00] more you look at him
[1:26:01] is the more you can make the changes
[1:26:03] because you want to be
[1:26:04] like him you want to look like him you
[1:26:07] want to walk
[1:26:08] like him you want to talk like him not
[1:26:11] like the church
[1:26:12] not like the pastor but like him
[1:26:16] unto them that look for him he shall
[1:26:19] appear
[1:26:19] those are the only ones he's gonna
[1:26:21] appear to not the one that's looking for
[1:26:23] church
[1:26:24] not the one that looking around the
[1:26:25] world but the ones who are focused
[1:26:27] on him so we want to bring back the
[1:26:30] focus in our lives
[1:26:31] i'm not a complicated preacher i'm a
[1:26:33] simple preacher
[1:26:34] i want to see jesus that's who i want to
[1:26:37] see
[1:26:37] all these years we've seen a lot of
[1:26:39] flesh we've seen a lot of explanation

[1:26:43] a lot of people come and go
[1:26:45] but sirs i want to see jesus i'm looking

[1:26:54] i want to find him in the word i want to
[1:26:56] find how he speaks about me

[1:27:02] in the word and we have to find what's
[1:27:05] written about us
[1:27:06] in the word and but the panel said if
[1:27:08] you read this bible
[1:27:09] and don't see jesus in every verse of

[1:27:19] our peace and

[1:27:22] world is falling apart
[1:27:24] don't look for the economy because that
[1:27:26] can't help you
[1:27:27] but look to jesus he could take care of
[1:27:30] you
[1:27:30] he promised to never leave you
[1:27:32] comfortable he promised

[1:28:38] all speaking about that great promise
[1:28:40] and that great promise is jesus the
[1:28:42] mystery of god
[1:28:44] the whole mystery of god revealed every
[1:28:47] promise of god
[1:28:48] wrapped up in jesus and the love gift
[1:28:51] that jesus has for his wife so that his
[1:28:54] wife can make herself ready

[1:29:49] the prophet came to introduce messiah
[1:29:52] he came to make sure that we didn't look
[1:29:55] at him
[1:29:55] but at branham said i didn't come to
[1:29:56] build a denomination i didn't come to
[1:29:58] draw people to myself
[1:30:00] but he came to introduce messiah and
[1:30:03] only those that look to him
[1:30:04] will see that this god that was hidden
[1:30:07] from all generations
[1:30:09] only in this time the fullness of god

[1:32:20] have made so complicated
[1:32:22] is a very simple message it's about
[1:32:25] bringing jesus christ on the scene

[1:35:03] opened
[1:35:04] what is the opening of the seals then
[1:35:07] revealing
[1:35:08] christ so that's how we could see what
[1:35:11] we see and that's why we look the way we
[1:35:13] look and that's how
[1:35:14] we act the way we act and the very seven
[1:35:17] angels
[1:35:18] which represented the seven churches all
[1:35:21] completed
[1:35:22] and we couldn't even see it they did
[1:35:24] they took the picture not us
[1:35:26] and here he is standing there supreme
[1:35:28] judge
[1:35:29] showing that he is alpha and omega the

[1:36:55] he said how could we have faith for a
[1:36:57] rapture
[1:36:57] if we can have even faith for divine
[1:36:59] healing it will take the quickening
[1:37:01] power

[1:38:49] move just like the pastor you know why
[1:38:51] because their eyes are on the pastor oh
[1:38:54] anybody with me this morning
[1:38:56] oh hallelujah but there has to come a
[1:38:59] shift a
[1:39:00] change in your walk and your talk so
[1:39:02] that when you look at jesus
[1:39:04] then your revelation isn't based on
[1:39:06] anybody else's revelation
[1:39:08] you are so focused on him that wherever
[1:39:11] he
[1:39:11] goes you willing to go whatever he says
[1:39:14] you willing to do
[1:39:15] because you are looking to him to please
[1:39:17] him is not looking at him to be aware of
[1:39:20] him no
[1:39:21] but it's to please him you're looking
[1:39:24] for him you desire him
[1:39:28] you want to be like him you are
[1:39:30] expecting him
[1:39:31] you are preparing for him you're doing
[1:39:34] all that you need to do
[1:39:35] because you want to be connected with
[1:39:37] him you want to be united with him
[1:39:39] you want to be one with him that is the
[1:39:42] power of this
[1:39:43] message can the church say amen there's
[1:39:46] no other gospel
[1:39:47] that brings that unity with one between
[1:39:50] god and his church
[1:39:51] within christ and his bride that great
[1:39:53] holy union
[1:39:55] that unity of the head with the body
[1:39:59] unto them that look
[1:40:03] for him
[1:40:06] during this period of this pandemic
[1:40:10] there will be people who will drift away
[1:40:13] and there'll be people who come in
[1:40:15] because this is a great test in time
[1:40:17] this is a testing time
[1:40:19] there's nobody there to give you a hug
[1:40:22] and say you have to social distance
[1:40:24] so you have to encourage yourself
[1:40:27] you have to encourage yourself there's
[1:40:29] nobody to say just shake your hand you
[1:40:30] have to shake your own hand
[1:40:33] can the church say amen oh hallelujah
[1:40:36] like david he encouraged himself in the
[1:40:38] lord
[1:40:39] that's a real soldier now hallelujah
[1:40:42] when you can't see your church brother
[1:40:44] your church sister you
[1:40:46] know that that what is most important is
[1:40:48] to see him
[1:40:54] no one has ever seen him and remain the
[1:40:56] same hallelujah
[1:40:59] moses saw him as a burning bush
[1:41:02] and the moses that went up was not the
[1:41:04] moses that went down
[1:41:05] it's impossible to see him i have the
[1:41:08] same attitude
[1:41:09] you had when you walked up to him
[1:41:13] the more you see him is the more your
[1:41:15] behavior has to change
[1:41:19] because he is truth he is light he is
[1:41:21] the word
[1:41:23] he is perfection he is perfect
[1:41:26] and when you see him in perfection you
[1:41:29] look and see your imperfection
[1:41:31] and if there's a seed in your soul it
[1:41:33] drives you to be perfect
[1:41:35] then you take the word of god and you
[1:41:36] could read be there for perfect
[1:41:39] and now it takes on a new meaning
[1:41:40] because you are looking at his
[1:41:42] perfection
[1:41:43] you are looking at the fact that he
[1:41:45] didn't have to take
[1:41:46] your place what he did and if you see
[1:41:49] that about him it wants you to draw
[1:41:51] closer to him
[1:41:53] because he did for you what nobody else
[1:41:55] could do
[1:41:56] oh somebody help me this morning
[1:42:01] unto them that look for him
[1:42:06] looking for him looking for his coming
[1:42:10] looking for his power looking for his
[1:42:12] presence looking for his anointing
[1:42:15] looking for his word to be read to you
[1:42:17] this morning
[1:42:18] only unto them that look for him
[1:42:23] i hope this resonates in your soul this
[1:42:25] morning
[1:42:26] what are you looking for but i brought
[1:42:28] him in that message looky keep asking
[1:42:29] the question what are you looking for
[1:42:32] what are you looking for what are you
[1:42:34] looking for
[1:42:35] i'm looking for him i want to see him
[1:42:39] i want to see him walk in my life i want
[1:42:41] to see him walk among the young people
[1:42:43] i'm looking for him
[1:42:44] i'm looking for him to restore the
[1:42:47] backsliders
[1:42:48] i'm looking for him and he promised if
[1:42:50] you look for him he will appear
[1:42:52] he is promised up here and he has never
[1:42:55] broken a promise
[1:42:57] he has never broken a promise mama are
[1:43:00] you looking for him this morning papa
[1:43:02] are you looking for him this morning
[1:43:06] hallelujah but i'm saying you get what
[1:43:09] you expect
[1:43:10] so if you're looking for him to visit
[1:43:11] your children he's going to appear
[1:43:13] if you're looking for him to visit your
[1:43:15] house he will appear you're looking
[1:43:16] to provide for you he will appear can
[1:43:18] the church say man
[1:43:20] be encouraged this morning be encouraged
[1:43:22] this morning
[1:43:24] we still talking about the quickening
[1:43:25] power that connection between him and us
[1:43:29] hallelujah because he is power
[1:43:33] hallelujah hallelujah and listen the
[1:43:36] brethren said it this way
[1:43:37] he said when the bride gets to know who
[1:43:39] she is
[1:43:41] then the rapture will go the
[1:43:44] consciousness of who you are the
[1:43:45] revelation of who you are the mystery of
[1:43:47] who you are
[1:43:48] being made known to you
[1:43:52] because perfect faith is based on
[1:43:54] position
[1:43:56] your power is based in your position
[1:44:00] hallelujah and when you're in your
[1:44:02] position and you know
[1:44:04] your position it's clear to you your
[1:44:06] authority
[1:44:09] when you don't know your position you
[1:44:10] don't know your authority
[1:44:13] with position comes authority with
[1:44:15] position comes power
[1:44:17] even if somebody is weak and they have a
[1:44:20] certain position
[1:44:21] that position gives them certain power
[1:44:23] certain authority
[1:44:25] and the devil's whole job has been to
[1:44:27] take you out of your position
[1:44:31] when you are out of your position you
[1:44:33] lose your power
[1:44:34] you lose your authority but when you get
[1:44:37] into your position
[1:44:39] it automatically comes with power it
[1:44:41] automatically comes with authority
[1:44:43] when you get into a position that's why
[1:44:46] when abram speaks about being
[1:44:48] positionally placed
[1:44:50] oh hallelujah because when you're in
[1:44:52] your position
[1:44:53] the devil knows he has to back up
[1:44:56] hallelujah when you're in your position
[1:44:58] the demons
[1:44:59] have to back up because in your position
[1:45:02] no devil could move hallelujah but the
[1:45:05] planet would be there you'd be
[1:45:06] taking the building and see what i'm
[1:45:08] waiting on i'm waiting for the angel
[1:45:11] he is here he said i take every spirit
[1:45:13] not some
[1:45:14] i take every spirit under my control
[1:45:18] not a demon move not a spirit move
[1:45:20] because he was a son
[1:45:22] in his position that was one son on the
[1:45:25] earth
[1:45:25] in position what about our day when
[1:45:29] sons plural the manifestation of the
[1:45:31] sons of god
[1:45:32] who have been looking to him looking for
[1:45:35] him are now
[1:45:36] placed in position what will it be
[1:45:40] oh what devil could hold your son what
[1:45:42] devil could hold your daughter
[1:45:44] what demon could step into your home
[1:45:48] because you are in position can the
[1:45:51] church say amen
[1:45:53] listen to the prophet we're going on our
[1:45:56] lord jesus
[1:45:57] is so full of quickening power oh he
[1:46:00] was all of it together oh hallelujah
[1:46:04] that makes me want to run around the
[1:46:05] building
[1:46:06] he was all of it together he was so full
[1:46:08] of quickening power
[1:46:09] he said this you destroy this body and
[1:46:12] i'll raise it up in three days
[1:46:14] talk about confidence in the quickening
[1:46:16] power
[1:46:17] so brother branham is saying that jesus
[1:46:19] had confidence
[1:46:21] in the quickening power that he could
[1:46:22] say destroy this in treatise i'll raise
[1:46:24] it up again
[1:46:26] do you have confidence in the quickening
[1:46:28] power
[1:46:29] ah mama papa oh hallelujah
[1:46:33] have confidence this morning come on
[1:46:35] sister christine
[1:46:36] have confidence in the quickening power
[1:46:39] but military have confidence
[1:46:40] in the quickening power if you afflicted
[1:46:42] this morning have confidence in the
[1:46:44] quickening power
[1:46:46] because with the quickening power jesus
[1:46:48] said i can lay this life down
[1:46:50] but the quickening power will raise me
[1:46:52] back up again
[1:46:57] oh blessed be the name of the lord
[1:47:02] destroy this body and this temple and i
[1:47:04] bring it up in three days
[1:47:06] why'd he say that he knew that it was
[1:47:09] written
[1:47:09] of him glory
[1:47:12] see it was written of him by the word of
[1:47:14] god which
[1:47:15] cannot feel so he said so
[1:47:18] knowing that the quickening power
[1:47:21] connects with the word
[1:47:23] you heard that spoken about you
[1:47:26] so according to the word the quickening
[1:47:29] power
[1:47:30] connects with the word that's spoken so
[1:47:32] he found a word
[1:47:34] written about him and his confidence in
[1:47:36] the quickening power
[1:47:38] and in the world that was spoken give
[1:47:40] him the confidence
[1:47:41] to see it destroy this temple and in
[1:47:44] three days i'll raise it up again
[1:47:46] but i have good news for you this
[1:47:47] morning there's words written about you
[1:47:51] there's words written about me the
[1:47:53] quickened power cannot fail
[1:47:55] because it's not our power he is the
[1:47:57] quickening power
[1:47:58] he is the holy ghost he is a spirit of
[1:48:01] god
[1:48:01] he is a dynamic and that cannot fail
[1:48:04] and if the word that we preach is the
[1:48:07] word of god
[1:48:08] then that word cannot fail and when that
[1:48:10] quickening power
[1:48:11] when the holy ghost when the dynamics
[1:48:13] connect with the mechanics
[1:48:15] word that's spoken about us
[1:48:18] oh it's finished time to shout
[1:48:21] time to give god glory so the word says
[1:48:24] i am the god that healeth you
[1:48:26] the word says you shall be by his
[1:48:28] stripes
[1:48:29] i am healed by his stripes you are
[1:48:32] healed
[1:48:32] by his stripes we are healed oh his word
[1:48:36] promised a revival his word promised
[1:48:38] that we are going to see him
[1:48:40] and that's why we come this morning even
[1:48:42] though we are not gathered together
[1:48:44] we are still looking to him
[1:48:48] oh blessed be the name of the lord
[1:48:52] somebody give the lord a shout of praise
[1:48:55] somebody give the lord a hand of praise
[1:48:58] somebody give god a shout out praise
[1:49:01] right where you're at
[1:49:02] oh hallelujah hallelujah that's okay
[1:49:06] if the neighbors hear you that's okay if
[1:49:09] your family hear you
[1:49:10] let them wonder why you're shouting in
[1:49:13] the middle of the pandemic
[1:49:14] let them wonder why you're happy and
[1:49:16] there are many reasons to be sad
[1:49:18] i sing because i'm happy i shout because
[1:49:21] i'm happy
[1:49:22] i sing because i'm free i'm sing because
[1:49:25] i know there's a quicken in power
[1:49:27] and i sing because i know there's a word
[1:49:30] written about me
[1:49:31] i sing because i'm looking to him and
[1:49:34] unto them that look to him
[1:49:36] shall he appear the second time
[1:49:39] without sin unto salvation he's coming
[1:49:42] to get a bribe
[1:49:43] he's coming to get his people he is
[1:49:45] coming to get his wife
[1:49:47] and his wife have made herself
[1:49:50] ready we are getting ready this morning
[1:49:54] we are making preparation this morning
[1:49:56] we are making preparations today
[1:49:59] to leave this place are you getting
[1:50:01] ready
[1:50:02] are you getting ready do you have your
[1:50:04] passport
[1:50:05] oh are you getting ready to leave this
[1:50:07] place the token is your passport
[1:50:12] hallelujah do you have your passport
[1:50:14] this morning
[1:50:15] your passport is is is not the church
[1:50:18] you attend
[1:50:19] the passport is not who your pastor is
[1:50:21] the passport is not how long in church
[1:50:24] we're trying to see him we want to
[1:50:26] connect to him we want to meet him
[1:50:28] but to close the gap you need a passport
[1:50:32] oh hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah
[1:50:36] oh i feel good this morning i want my
[1:50:39] passport
[1:50:41] right now our airport is shut down but
[1:50:44] this
[1:50:45] journey i'm talking about we don't need
[1:50:47] a local airport
[1:50:49] oh it's a highway to heaven there's a
[1:50:52] rap to express
[1:50:53] that any day now will come to pick up
[1:50:56] his pride
[1:50:57] behold a bridegroom comment going out to
[1:51:00] meet him
[1:51:01] oh and they that were ready they went in
[1:51:05] they that had their passport they went
[1:51:08] in
[1:51:09] there that had the extra oil they went
[1:51:12] in they that had the holy ghost they
[1:51:14] went in
[1:51:15] they that had the token they went in
[1:51:21] and that cry is going out this morning
[1:51:24] only unto them that look for him
[1:51:28] what are you looking for what are you
[1:51:31] looking for church
[1:51:32] what are you looking for friends this
[1:51:35] world is not getting better
[1:51:38] oh my don't look for this world to get
[1:51:41] better
[1:51:47] there's a prophecy of judgment over this
[1:51:50] it
[1:51:51] because the kings of the earth the sons
[1:51:54] of god who will reign and rule
[1:51:56] on this earth are getting ready to step
[1:51:58] into their position
[1:52:00] but abraham says the earth knows and
[1:52:02] recognizes when a sun is in place
[1:52:04] when a sun is in position when a sun is
[1:52:06] it is it's an authority
[1:52:10] so remember that branham is here he said
[1:52:11] sun cometh and shine four days he said i
[1:52:13] had to ask who's too speaking
[1:52:16] they know a manifested son is under it
[1:52:19] oh hallelujah you heard what you read
[1:52:21] he said he didn't say a word he just put
[1:52:23] his hand
[1:52:24] on the air and two days later there was
[1:52:27] no scar
[1:52:28] he didn't even pray he didn't say a word
[1:52:31] because that scar that cancer that demon
[1:52:34] knew that the sun was on the earth
[1:52:39] and that son served notice to that demon
[1:52:42] that son served notice without even
[1:52:44] seeing a word his very desire was made
[1:52:47] manifest
[1:52:48] his very intention was made manifest his
[1:52:50] thoughts containing the matter was made
[1:52:52] manifest
[1:52:54] glory to god what a time we are living
[1:52:57] in what a season we are living in
[1:52:59] with sons and daughters it's a maturing
[1:53:01] time
[1:53:04] oh hallelujah all of these situations
[1:53:07] you think god is surprised by the
[1:53:09] coronavirus
[1:53:10] you think god is suddenly trying to make
[1:53:13] adjustments because of this
[1:53:15] god saw all of this taking place he saw
[1:53:17] he set it up
[1:53:18] brother anthony he set it up this way he
[1:53:21] set up this certain service this way
[1:53:23] everything that led to this day was
[1:53:25] designed this day
[1:53:27] oh hallelujah because for all these
[1:53:29] years
[1:53:30] man has always wanted to look to man
[1:53:35] way back there when his people were
[1:53:38] coming together
[1:53:39] and they were a nation and they had been
[1:53:41] under prophets
[1:53:42] and under spiritual leadership they
[1:53:44] looked around themselves
[1:53:46] and saw the other nations with kings and
[1:53:49] they said we want a king too
[1:53:51] because the other nations have one
[1:53:55] and that's how king saul was established
[1:53:57] samuel was broken he was
[1:53:59] hurt god had to comfort his prophet to
[1:54:02] say
[1:54:02] they have not rejected you they have
[1:54:05] rejected me
[1:54:07] they're supposed to be looking to me
[1:54:09] they're supposed to be getting help from
[1:54:10] me
[1:54:11] they're supposed to be seeking my face
[1:54:14] but they want a man so they got a man
[1:54:18] named saul
[1:54:24] but god always long for that personal
[1:54:27] relationship
[1:54:30] where he can see you and you can see him
[1:54:34] hallelujah just as it was when he could
[1:54:37] come now in the
[1:54:38] cool of the evening i love that and
[1:54:40] speak to adam
[1:54:41] and adam could see him and he could see
[1:54:44] adam
[1:54:45] and they could have fellowship around
[1:54:47] what took place that day
[1:54:50] are you working to close the gap with
[1:54:52] fellowship
[1:54:53] with what happened to you every day i
[1:54:56] know it sounds simple
[1:54:57] but we have some religious fanatics who
[1:54:59] don't want to pray
[1:55:01] they are no mystery but there's no life
[1:55:03] there's no mystery but they're not
[1:55:05] looking to him
[1:55:06] they're looking for the next thing the
[1:55:07] next revelation the next
[1:55:09] whatever it is but they're not looking
[1:55:11] to jesus
[1:55:15] if people had been looking to jesus
[1:55:18] throughout all of these years many of
[1:55:20] the issues that took place in churches
[1:55:22] would have never taken place
[1:55:25] because the trust and the confidence
[1:55:27] should only be in christ jesus
[1:55:30] i love how paul expressed it and it
[1:55:33] keeps me grounded
[1:55:34] follow me as i follow christ in other
[1:55:37] words
[1:55:38] you have no excuse it is your individual
[1:55:42] responsibility
[1:55:43] to be following christ along the journey
[1:55:46] to following christ god can place many
[1:55:48] people in your way
[1:55:50] to encourage you so paul was saying i'm
[1:55:54] following christ you could follow me
[1:55:57] but make sure you're following christ
[1:55:59] yourself because if i stray
[1:56:01] you've got to keep focused
[1:56:05] that's the problem in the churches many
[1:56:07] people that confidence is in the man
[1:56:10] i don't want your confidence in me i
[1:56:12] don't want your confidence in the pastor
[1:56:13] your confidence has to be in him
[1:56:17] live or die friend or no friend
[1:56:20] whether i maintain my family let me
[1:56:23] maintain christ
[1:56:26] elijah had his focus they told him you
[1:56:30] know your master will be taken away
[1:56:32] you say hold your peace hold the peace
[1:56:35] i want to stay focused don't try to
[1:56:37] distract me
[1:56:38] that's why the horse wears blinders so
[1:56:40] they can just see

[1:58:30] great message

[1:58:34] in luke 17 30.

[1:58:55] that said
[1:58:56] he'd raise him up listen to the prophet
[1:58:59] says that we
[1:59:00] are already raised with him
[1:59:03] oh my so the prophet is not asking you
[1:59:07] the prophet is not suggesting he is
[1:59:09] speaking past tense
[1:59:11] we are already raised with him in other
[1:59:14] words who
[1:59:15] he for knew he called who he called he
[1:59:17] justified
[1:59:19] already it's past tense it's already
[1:59:20] happened who we justified he had already
[1:59:23] glorified
[1:59:25] what shall we then say to these things
[1:59:27] if god before us
[1:59:29] tell me who could be against us what
[1:59:31] principality
[1:59:32] what power what spiritual wickedness
[1:59:35] what disease
[1:59:36] what can be against us we know who we
[1:59:39] are
[1:59:40] we know where we're standing we know
[1:59:42] where we come from
[1:59:43] we know where we're going we know who
[1:59:45] the devil is and we have been equipped
[1:59:47] by this great message to recognize the
[1:59:50] devil
[1:59:51] at every one of his tricks it has
[1:59:53] nothing to do with emotion
[1:59:54] it has nothing with our feeling it has
[1:59:56] nothing but proven who is right
[1:59:58] and who's wrong we're dealing with
[2:00:00] individuals
[2:00:01] who see their names and when you see
[2:00:04] your name
[2:00:05] you see him because he is the one who
[2:00:07] put your name there
[2:00:09] you cannot see your name and not see the
[2:00:11] out of your name
[2:00:12] can the church say amen
[2:00:15] [Music]
[2:00:17] rejoice not because you have power but
[2:00:20] rejoice because your names are written
[2:00:24] we are already raised with him no wonder
[2:00:27] he said
[2:00:28] fear not and it is written that the
[2:00:31] spirit that is now was in him
[2:00:33] now in us also quickens our mortal body
[2:00:38] fear not oh blessed be
[2:00:41] the name of the lord hallelujah
[2:00:44] hallelujah hallelujah
[2:00:46] now listen to this
[2:00:49] the prophet said it's possible today
[2:00:52] that good man
[2:00:53] fine man walk with christ reading his
[2:00:57] word
[2:00:57] and still don't recognize that this
[2:01:00] is the hour that certain things of this
[2:01:03] bible must be fulfilled
[2:01:05] that's that's that's scary listen again
[2:01:09] it is possible today
[2:01:11] that good man fine man walk with christ
[2:01:14] reading his word and still don't
[2:01:17] recognize
[2:01:18] that this is the hour that certain
[2:01:21] things of this bible
[2:01:22] must be fulfilled it's the hour that
[2:01:26] we're living in the time is at hand
[2:01:27] when these things must be done it's
[2:01:29] written and thus it must be fulfilled
[2:01:32] because god promised it yes our eyes
[2:01:36] must be opened to see the word
[2:01:39] and but ibrahim and the message look
[2:01:41] talked about that
[2:01:42] look is looking at his word so it cannot
[2:01:45] be just a routine for you well i read a
[2:01:47] book
[2:01:47] i read a scripture and are in church and
[2:01:50] it has to be more than that
[2:01:51] it has to open to see the word
[2:01:56] listen to the prophet now give context
[2:01:58] he said the pharisees
[2:02:00] had that word drawed out just exactly
[2:02:04] the way
[2:02:05] the messiah was coming so he's saying
[2:02:07] the pharisees
[2:02:08] had access to all of the scrolls
[2:02:12] so they had access to what anybody else
[2:02:14] had access to
[2:02:16] they believed that they were right so
[2:02:17] even though they had access to the books
[2:02:20] and the tapes
[2:02:20] and they had access to everything they
[2:02:23] believed that they were right
[2:02:25] and here he was born and walked right
[2:02:28] among them and they condemned him when
[2:02:31] he told him
[2:02:32] you search the scriptures for in them
[2:02:36] you think you have eternal life
[2:02:38] and they are they that testify of me
[2:02:41] he said search the scriptures they said
[2:02:42] we are moses's disciples
[2:02:44] he said if you would be moses disciples
[2:02:48] you would know me for moses wrote of me
[2:02:52] and he did moses said the lord your god
[2:02:54] shall raise up a prophet
[2:02:56] like unto me a law giver and so forth
[2:02:59] and
[2:02:59] a prophet and him the people shall hear
[2:03:02] see
[2:03:03] if they have knowed moses writing they
[2:03:06] would have known him
[2:03:08] they thought they knowed moses writing
[2:03:11] but you see
[2:03:12] they didn't know it see they were
[2:03:14] blinded to that very fact
[2:03:17] so i want to nail this down here friends
[2:03:19] don't take it for granted
[2:03:21] don't just walk around saying when i
[2:03:23] read a book and i read a tape
[2:03:25] and i have the prophet message he was
[2:03:27] saying that is no different
[2:03:29] it's no different to the pharisees
[2:03:31] having all the scrolls
[2:03:33] they read the word they interpreted it
[2:03:35] the way they thought it would be
[2:03:38] and when messiah himself who they had
[2:03:41] been reading
[2:03:41] about when he appeared
[2:03:45] they didn't see him
[2:03:49] it is not that they weren't trying to
[2:03:52] look for him you know
[2:03:54] but they were not looking in the right
[2:03:57] way
[2:03:58] that's but iran is speaking about into
[2:04:00] looking unto jesus
[2:04:02] so be careful friends that you don't run
[2:04:05] down some doctrine some idea some man
[2:04:08] your own interpretation and just like
[2:04:10] the pharisees he said
[2:04:12] but we are moses disciples and that's
[2:04:13] how people talk today but i'm in the
[2:04:15] message
[2:04:16] this is the quote i have what quote you
[2:04:18] have
[2:04:19] and why are they arguing about quotes
[2:04:22] jesus himself is walking amongst them
[2:04:27] in the midst of them the word made flesh
[2:04:30] is there
[2:04:31] they're looking at the word looking at
[2:04:33] the word made flesh
[2:04:34] and they cannot make the connection
[2:04:38] you imagine that
[2:04:41] this is as if i'm reading about brother
[2:04:44] anthony and brother anthony
[2:04:45] and it's a description of him he's about
[2:04:46] this tall he's wearing this suit
[2:04:49] he's wearing a certain tie he's wearing
[2:04:51] his shoes and
[2:04:53] all of the description is there and i'm
[2:04:54] reading it i'm looking at him and i'm
[2:04:56] not even
[2:04:57] seeing that he is that
[2:05:04] so then it asks another question so then
[2:05:06] what the pharisees looking at
[2:05:08] and whether branham said it they were
[2:05:10] blinded to that very fact
[2:05:13] oh my my my my my mind
[2:05:16] oh hallelujah hallelujah
[2:05:20] so look closer friends make sure your
[2:05:23] heart is pure
[2:05:24] don't take it for granted don't follow a
[2:05:27] movement a doctrine a man an idea
[2:05:30] look at jesus christ him moving among us
[2:05:34] him moving as the holy ghost his move
[2:05:37] him moving at the spirit of god in such
[2:05:38] a time as this
[2:05:39] i'm not going to be too much longer with
[2:05:41] you
[2:05:42] all but oversee when i keep the main
[2:05:44] thing the main thing
[2:05:46] and the main thing is that this world
[2:05:48] needs jesus but it will not come in the
[2:05:50] way they expected now to be jesus
[2:05:52] veiled in sons and daughters of god who
[2:05:55] have
[2:05:55] yielded themselves who have sacrificed
[2:05:58] themselves who have gone through
[2:05:59] place of trying who have gone through
[2:06:01] character formation
[2:06:03] who have resisted every temptation who
[2:06:05] have brought their
[2:06:07] their doubt on the subjection so that
[2:06:09] they can see plainly
[2:06:10] that jesus christ is the same yesterday
[2:06:13] today and forever
[2:06:15] this world has got to live this world
[2:06:18] has got to live friends
[2:06:19] oh somebody give the lord a shout our
[2:06:22] praise
[2:06:23] i'm not going to be too much longer with
[2:06:24] you
[2:06:28] hallelujah from i have heard but now i
[2:06:31] see
[2:06:32] but the branham said oh men and women
[2:06:34] tonight i say today
[2:06:36] if you can look around and see how close
[2:06:39] we are
[2:06:40] to the coming of the lord listen closely
[2:06:42] now
[2:06:43] listen if you could look around
[2:06:46] unto them that look to him so if you
[2:06:49] look around
[2:06:51] you know i know who's serious
[2:06:55] because if you look into him brother
[2:06:56] shane it means your fruits
[2:06:59] should speak of if you really seen him
[2:07:05] you know and and and it's interesting
[2:07:07] because
[2:07:08] i think this whole pandemic has
[2:07:10] highlighted a lot of things
[2:07:14] the ministry of health would tell people
[2:07:17] put on masks sanitize social distance
[2:07:21] and people hearing it you know but when
[2:07:24] you drive something you've seen people
[2:07:26] and you're asking yourself didn't hear
[2:07:27] it
[2:07:30] after all these months it's not the
[2:07:32] announcement was it made yesterday at
[2:07:33] all
[2:07:36] there are still people who have heard it
[2:07:38] and they don't believe it
[2:07:40] and listen they're seeing other people
[2:07:44] doing it and that is not enough to
[2:07:47] convince them
[2:07:48] to at least make an attempt or even if
[2:07:52] they're making an attempt they're doing
[2:07:53] it in a half-hearted way
[2:07:58] what accounts for that difference
[2:08:02] because i'm trying to understand because
[2:08:03] because but the brandon would say he
[2:08:05] said i can preach that i'm blue in the
[2:08:06] face
[2:08:11] and it doesn't matter how much preaching
[2:08:12] is done until you take it in your heart
[2:08:15] and begin to do something about it what
[2:08:18] we see
[2:08:19] should put our souls into action
[2:08:23] so this whole message is continuing
[2:08:25] along a vein
[2:08:26] of getting into action because unto them
[2:08:29] that look for him because looking is
[2:08:31] active you look at him
[2:08:34] where is he where is he where is he
[2:08:38] it's like the wise men where is he we
[2:08:40] have come from afar we're looking for
[2:08:42] him we're looking for jesus
[2:08:44] and they caught the whole city unawares
[2:08:48] they have the book to have the teams but
[2:08:49] nobody looking for him
[2:08:52] meanwhile the wise man coming under
[2:08:53] expectation where is he where is he
[2:08:55] where is he we've been coming from a
[2:08:58] long way because we're looking for him
[2:09:00] something about him caught our attention
[2:09:02] and we want to meet him we want to see
[2:09:04] him we want to have an experience we
[2:09:05] have something for him
[2:09:06] we're not coming empty-handed but we
[2:09:08] bring in something because we know who
[2:09:09] he is
[2:09:11] oh hallelujah we know what he means
[2:09:14] oh i can imagine it to me he's king i
[2:09:17] brought
[2:09:18] gold to rapist and his majesty
[2:09:21] oh my my my my my i brought frankincense
[2:09:25] because of the service that he would do
[2:09:27] and it testified i brought my because he
[2:09:30] will die
[2:09:33] but meanwhile the whole spiritual
[2:09:36] capital as it were
[2:09:38] people going around normal
[2:09:41] god sent a prophet you read the book
[2:09:44] let's go through that coat and talk
[2:09:46] about the coat meanwhile there's a
[2:09:48] there's a cry
[2:09:50] let this be the cry this morning where
[2:09:52] is he this morning
[2:09:54] that same jesus i'm looking for him are
[2:09:56] you looking for him
[2:09:57] are you trying to find him did you bring
[2:10:00] something for him are you preparing for
[2:10:01] him
[2:10:02] oh hallelujah what gift did you bring to
[2:10:05] the lord
[2:10:07] did you bring worship did you consecrate
[2:10:08] yourself this morning
[2:10:10] did you consecrate your heart did you
[2:10:12] approach this as a
[2:10:13] as a real service even though you're in
[2:10:15] your home or you just got up and
[2:10:17] you're just relaxing taking in the
[2:10:19] service is that how you're looking for
[2:10:20] him
[2:10:22] he is judge he is king he is the high
[2:10:26] priest
[2:10:29] are you looking for him
[2:10:33] are you trying to meet him is that how
[2:10:35] you want to meet him
[2:10:37] but a random preacher would approach to
[2:10:38] god what's your approach this morning
[2:10:41] because if you see him
[2:10:43] and you recognize how close he is it
[2:10:45] should hasten your actions
[2:10:47] it will adjust your attitude because you
[2:10:50] recognize if you don't
[2:10:51] come in contact with him you're finished
[2:10:55] glory to god help us this morning lord
[2:10:58] help us help us help us help us he is
[2:11:02] holy
[2:11:03] and he promised to judge this world and
[2:11:05] to bring back man into his position
[2:11:08] that's not a casual statement that's a
[2:11:11] reward to the overcomers
[2:11:15] it's as a reward to the overcomers those
[2:11:17] who overcome the lust of the eyes
[2:11:19] overcome the lust of the flesh overcome
[2:11:21] living ordinary
[2:11:23] overcome just taking the bible as
[2:11:25] there's a book
[2:11:26] that's to to read but they overcome and
[2:11:29] they see that they have to add to their
[2:11:30] faith virtue
[2:11:31] and the virtue knowledge and the
[2:11:33] knowledge temperance and the temperance
[2:11:35] patience
[2:11:35] and the patience godliness and the
[2:11:37] godliness broadly kindness
[2:11:38] because you are looking at him you are
[2:11:40] seeing him you are seeing his nature
[2:11:42] you are seeing his being you are seeing
[2:11:44] his attributes
[2:11:48] and you want to talk like him that's why
[2:11:51] they take note they had been with jesus
[2:11:53] written epistles that's my promise is it
[2:11:56] yours
[2:11:57] if you see him then live it if you see
[2:12:00] him that acted
[2:12:01] yes you'll stumble along the way but
[2:12:03] make sure every day you are closer
[2:12:06] make sure every day he becomes clearer
[2:12:08] to you that the
[2:12:09] message of the hour becomes clearer to
[2:12:11] you
[2:12:12] as but over it said a few weeks ago to
[2:12:14] see beyond the filler material
[2:12:17] to see the message the real message see
[2:12:20] the gift
[2:12:21] because this message is a message of a
[2:12:22] gift it's a gift to an
[2:12:24] elect lady who has been promised to meet
[2:12:27] him
[2:12:27] but ibrahimovic the the engagement ring
[2:12:30] of predestination
[2:12:33] oh to somebody's engaged to him for an
[2:12:35] encounter with him
[2:12:37] oh i'm getting ready to begin to whining
[2:12:40] in a few minutes
[2:12:41] i trust is a blessing to you this
[2:12:43] morning and god is
[2:12:45] is is interrupting your home hallelujah
[2:12:48] as he's interrupting as he interrupted
[2:12:51] moses
[2:12:51] casual living we are living too casual
[2:12:56] i i hear and it's around the world if
[2:12:58] the world had taken this thing
[2:13:00] seriously earlier they said it would not
[2:13:03] have spread the way he did you know
[2:13:06] but people take it casual
[2:13:10] why is man like that
[2:13:14] why is only when the pressure reached so
[2:13:16] much that you're
[2:13:17] back against you all you're trying to do
[2:13:19] all you could do
[2:13:22] and it takes a forcing of legislation
[2:13:26] lock this door lock this down lock this
[2:13:28] down
[2:13:29] because that nature of man really not
[2:13:31] designed to comply with order
[2:13:34] when man fell out of god's order order
[2:13:37] was something that disappeared
[2:13:40] it became a struggle it became a battle
[2:13:42] to him
[2:13:44] and we see it in the natural how much
[2:13:45] more in the spiritual people come to
[2:13:47] church
[2:13:49] and they claim to see jesus because you
[2:13:51] can't be in this mess without having
[2:13:53] some kind of glimpse of who he is
[2:14:00] but then you can see who is really
[2:14:01] looking for him and who
[2:14:03] look at him once in a while he just
[2:14:05] glanced at him
[2:14:08] versus actively lord i'm sick in your
[2:14:10] face
[2:14:13] as the heart pant after the water broke
[2:14:15] so my soul
[2:14:17] stopped david was looking for him
[2:14:21] trust deep desire
[2:14:24] i don't want to be this way i want more

[2:17:24] you
[2:17:24] to go all the way in god's promises
[2:17:27] that's why i keep saying the holy spirit
[2:17:29] the quickening power has to take you all
[2:17:32] the way

[2:17:52] now are you looking for him friends
[2:17:55] are you looking for him friends oh
[2:17:59] hallelujah he is my vaccine
[2:18:02] he is my comfort so i'm looking to him i
[2:18:04] have way more confidence
[2:18:06] i have full confidence that he who
[2:18:09] started the work in you and i
[2:18:10] is more than able to complete it i have
[2:18:13] confidence
[2:18:14] that he is able to preserve my soul he
[2:18:17] is able to preserve your soul
[2:18:19] he is able to preserve you until the day
[2:18:21] of your redemption
[2:18:23] oh that's my assurance this morning
[2:18:26] that's my confidence this morning
[2:18:29] listen to the prophet he goes on this is
[2:18:31] the same message
[2:18:32] this is in 1965.
[2:18:36] this is november the 27th this is just a
[2:18:39] few weeks before the prophet is taken
[2:18:42] and this is what he's preaching you know
[2:18:45] how i feel about last words
[2:18:52] no matter how religious you are how many
[2:18:55] churches you belong to
[2:18:57] how many books your name's on if that
[2:19:00] genuine holy ghost is in you which is
[2:19:03] the
[2:19:03] word manifested you'll see
[2:19:06] the message and here's the message so
[2:19:09] you'll see him
[2:19:10] and the hour because it's the holy ghost
[2:19:12] that does it
[2:19:14] but there has to be something light that
[2:19:17] off inspiration strike you
[2:19:20] and if you pour water on the ground on
[2:19:23] the ground
[2:19:23] on the ground and there's no seed in
[2:19:25] there to strike it
[2:19:26] how can it ever bring forth anything
[2:19:29] there's nothing there to bring forth
[2:19:31] that is
[2:19:31] only the elected of god will see it
[2:19:34] so i wanted to begin to rejoice right
[2:19:36] now because only
[2:19:38] the elected of god will see this thing
[2:19:41] that i'm talking about this morning
[2:19:42] it's not for everybody it's not for the
[2:19:45] church member
[2:19:46] it's not for people who believe because
[2:19:47] even the devil believes
[2:19:51] but it's the elect of god who there's a
[2:19:53] seed in their soul
[2:19:55] that deep seed in the soul and there's a
[2:19:57] deep calling
[2:19:58] so there's got to be a deep to respond
[2:20:01] and you're looking for him every day
[2:20:03] you recognize that he's getting closer
[2:20:04] so you don't want to miss him now
[2:20:06] you're looking for him so you don't want
[2:20:08] to you want to make sure that when
[2:20:09] you're going to work
[2:20:10] that you're on your job that you don't
[2:20:12] let it get so distracting for you
[2:20:14] oh come on now that you lose sight of
[2:20:16] him
[2:20:17] hallelujah you don't want the news the
[2:20:19] politics
[2:20:20] the internet to let you lose so you know
[2:20:22] when you switch things off
[2:20:23] is to make sure you see him oh my my i
[2:20:27] hope this resonates in your soul this
[2:20:29] morning
[2:20:31] the elected of god seen it in noah's
[2:20:34] time
[2:20:35] so what are we saying now it's a
[2:20:39] it's an election thing
[2:20:42] it's an election thing the elected of
[2:20:45] god seen it in noah's time
[2:20:47] moses time jesus time in other words
[2:20:50] think about it friends
[2:20:51] the pharisees who had the books they had
[2:20:54] the quotes
[2:20:55] they had moses words and they missed him
[2:20:58] but here's a man named peter
[2:21:00] oh a symbol fisherman he's not fully
[2:21:03] transformed yet
[2:21:04] but his name in the book oh he would
[2:21:07] make many mistakes
[2:21:08] he would even deny christ but he was
[2:21:11] predestinated
[2:21:12] to see him oh my oh my
[2:21:16] and he lived it out when peter stepped
[2:21:19] out under the boat
[2:21:20] he said lord if it is you bid me come oh
[2:21:23] he was looking at jesus he was looking
[2:21:26] at jesus
[2:21:26] but when he took his eyes off of jesus
[2:21:29] he began to
[2:21:30] to sink he had to keep his eyes on jesus
[2:21:34] and you have to keep your eyes on jesus
[2:21:39] the elected of god seen it in noah's
[2:21:42] time
[2:21:42] moses time jesus time the apostles time
[2:21:47] looters i'm reading the prophet luther's
[2:21:49] time
[2:21:50] wesley time pentecostal time this is
[2:21:53] 1965
[2:21:55] i feel like shelton the prophet didn't
[2:21:57] just see his time
[2:21:58] but now we can see it and in this time
[2:22:02] whoa we see it we see the purpose of
[2:22:06] this great message we see who we are in
[2:22:09] the world
[2:22:10] we see jesus in the world we see him
[2:22:12] coming
[2:22:13] we see his appearing we see his signs we
[2:22:16] see his wonders
[2:22:17] we see his miracles
[2:22:21] we see a revival in our souls we see
[2:22:24] restoration time
[2:22:25] we see manifestation time we see our
[2:22:28] family being delivered time
[2:22:30] we see our sons being delivered time our
[2:22:32] daughters being delivered time
[2:22:34] and no devil could stop it no demon
[2:22:36] could stop it
[2:22:37] no principality could stop it oh
[2:22:40] hallelujah
[2:22:41] they have got to come as for me and my
[2:22:43] house
[2:22:44] we will serve the lord o glory to god
[2:22:50] my i'm trying to wrap up but this is
[2:22:52] this is too good
[2:22:54] i don't know if you're having a time in
[2:22:55] your home but i'm having a time this
[2:22:56] morning
[2:22:57] oh this is too good to know that god
[2:23:00] opened our eyes
[2:23:02] we didn't open it he opened our eyes he
[2:23:04] elected us
[2:23:06] to see who he is to see who we are
[2:23:09] to see who the devil is and to know that
[2:23:11] we are going to make it
[2:23:13] every day we wake up and we stretch and
[2:23:16] say thank god for waking me up
[2:23:18] today i'm going to get closer i want to
[2:23:20] see more of him
[2:23:21] more of him through his word more of him
[2:23:24] to the scripture
[2:23:25] more of him and he has not stopped
[2:23:27] revealing himself to us
[2:23:29] oh hallelujah god is still speaking you
[2:23:33] know
[2:23:35] oh oh oh
[2:23:40] the prophet in the days of the voice
[2:23:44] and we are in the days of the voice the
[2:23:46] mystery is finished
[2:23:48] but it doesn't mean god has stopped
[2:23:50] talking oh
[2:23:51] oh you don't hear me this morning
[2:23:54] god is speaking he's speaking this
[2:23:56] morning there are many men around the
[2:23:58] world god is speaking this morning to
[2:24:00] his elect lady
[2:24:02] oh hallelujah hallelujah
[2:24:05] and brother branham said i'll say what
[2:24:07] the tapes say
[2:24:09] oh he said let there come man who would
[2:24:10] make more sense to it
[2:24:12] it can make more sense to it unless god
[2:24:14] inspires it to be so
[2:24:16] oh it can be man's idea god is still
[2:24:19] speaking oh hallelujah
[2:24:22] glory to god he's still delivering he is
[2:24:25] still restoring
[2:24:26] he is still breaking the bands of sin
[2:24:30] and by the preaching of the word faith
[2:24:32] comes to destroy doubt
[2:24:34] and to destroy unbelief and to let you
[2:24:36] know your past
[2:24:37] is not going to determine your future
[2:24:41] your mistakes will not determine your
[2:24:43] future if god held
[2:24:45] peter's mistakes to him he would never
[2:24:47] be the apostle he is today
[2:24:49] if god held saul who became paul you
[2:24:52] understand the paradox of this
[2:24:56] a man who persecuted the church
[2:24:58] orchestrated stephen's murder
[2:25:01] and god said yes that's the one that's
[2:25:04] my name saul
[2:25:06] oh you might know him as saul but in my
[2:25:08] book his name is paul
[2:25:09] oh glory to god you might know his past
[2:25:11] but i know his future
[2:25:13] you might talk about his mistakes but i
[2:25:14] know what he will accomplish
[2:25:16] until he would share with timothy i've
[2:25:18] fought a good fight
[2:25:20] i've kept the faith i've finished my
[2:25:22] course i've stood the test
[2:25:24] i've done what god put in me to do and
[2:25:27] i've left it here
[2:25:28] for our elect lady who will pick it up
[2:25:31] through the scriptures
[2:25:32] and a prophet who will come who will
[2:25:34] quote these scriptures
[2:25:35] to prepare bride for the lord
[2:25:39] oh hallelujah blessed be the name of the
[2:25:42] lord
[2:25:43] so i just want to try to close up here
[2:25:45] trust is a blessing with you the elected
[2:25:47] of god
[2:25:48] seen it in noah's time so the elect
[2:25:50] cannot miss it
[2:25:52] the elect will see it the elect will be
[2:25:56] the ones looking for him that's always
[2:25:57] i know who's serious about this gospel
[2:26:01] because something pulsates maybe maybe
[2:26:04] you have not been looking as you should
[2:26:07] but there's something pulsating in your
[2:26:08] soul telling you this morning do better
[2:26:11] look harder go look again but i branham
[2:26:13] in that same message look
[2:26:15] use the example of elijah and he said
[2:26:18] when he told that boy go
[2:26:20] look he said he came back down
[2:26:23] he said i didn't see anything in the
[2:26:25] same message when he read the same
[2:26:26] scripture
[2:26:27] and he told that boy go look again go
[2:26:29] look again
[2:26:31] go look again and that's why i said
[2:26:32] during the service young brother young
[2:26:34] sister i don't know who's connected
[2:26:36] we don't track who's connected to this
[2:26:37] service this morning but if you have
[2:26:40] ever lost your way
[2:26:41] with the lord maybe maybe maybe
[2:26:45] somebody threw you off maybe somebody
[2:26:48] did something and
[2:26:49] and you just was so disappointed maybe
[2:26:52] you were under church and something
[2:26:53] happened maybe
[2:26:54] something happened to you and i want to
[2:26:57] challenge you don't look
[2:26:58] at church don't look at man
[2:27:01] i want to challenge you to look again
[2:27:04] take
[2:27:05] another look at jesus take another look
[2:27:09] at jesus
[2:27:10] take another look at the word of god
[2:27:13] take another look at the word of god
[2:27:15] concerning you
[2:27:16] i know the plans i have for you good
[2:27:19] thoughts
[2:27:22] not thoughts of your destruction but
[2:27:24] thoughts of your perfection
[2:27:26] thoughts of your adoption
[2:27:29] because he's coming back
[2:27:33] he's coming back to those who are
[2:27:36] looking for him i believe this morning
[2:27:38] that
[2:27:39] throughout this connection there are
[2:27:42] many people who are looking to him i
[2:27:44] want you to lift your hands right now
[2:27:45] [Music]
[2:27:47] oh hallelujah
[2:27:50] but abraham went on now why are the
[2:27:53] inspirations poured out to gather the
[2:27:55] bride together
[2:27:57] it's only those who are elected will see
[2:27:59] it
[2:28:00] jesus said i thank thee father that thou
[2:28:03] has hid these things
[2:28:04] from the eyes of the wise and prudent
[2:28:07] and reveal it to babe such as would
[2:28:09] learn
[2:28:10] and now inspiration has to strike it
[2:28:13] [Music]
[2:28:16] oh i have a prayer from the prophet with
[2:28:18] our heads bowed all over
[2:28:20] i want to challenge you lift your hands
[2:28:22] right now wherever you are
[2:28:24] don't look at me don't look at anybody

[2:28:33] more than anybody else make that your
[2:28:36] prayer lord i want to see you

[2:28:42] seeing my mistakes

[2:28:46] past it all
[2:28:48] i'm willing to go past my past i want
[2:28:51] you to stop looking at your past this
[2:28:52] morning

[2:29:13] all the way
[2:29:16] will he go all the way
[2:29:21] oh i'm trying to close out but
[2:29:24] i feel a pull this morning
[2:29:28] maybe you have been looking to jesus as
[2:29:30] you should
[2:29:32] and i want to connect back to the
[2:29:33] service i preached a few weeks ago have
[2:29:35] we done enough
[2:29:37] [Music]
[2:29:39] friends we have not done enough
[2:29:42] we've been guilty of allowing the
[2:29:44] distractions of the world to
[2:29:46] pull our attention
[2:29:52] [Music]
[2:29:54] in the days of noah i can imagine
[2:29:59] the children asking daddy are you sure
[2:30:05] have we done all we should do
[2:30:07] [Music]
[2:30:11] are we how we should be
[2:30:15] in other words have we done enough
[2:30:18] [Music]
[2:30:20] if you see him in his word this morning
[2:30:22] friends
[2:30:23] are you ready what else must we do
[2:30:32] has moses stood there giving the
[2:30:33] instructions
[2:30:35] to put the blood on the door i can
[2:30:38] imagine as the time will pass
[2:30:40] and they hear the screams coming down
[2:30:43] daddy are you sure
[2:30:47] did you do it the way moses said
[2:30:51] have we done enough
[2:31:02] [Music]
[2:31:06] friend when you see him it's impossible
[2:31:10] to hold an ought
[2:31:15] when you see jesus it's impossible to
[2:31:17] hold ought
[2:31:20] because there's so much he could hold
[2:31:22] over you
[2:31:29] but if branham would relate how he went
[2:31:30] into a restaurant i believe one time
[2:31:33] and he saw this young lady with all the
[2:31:36] makeup on you know the story
[2:31:41] and at that point he lost sight of jesus
[2:31:46] he lost sight of what jesus did for him
[2:31:49] he saw that lady there and say lord is
[2:31:51] this the world
[2:31:52] you want my daughter to grow up in this
[2:31:54] is the world my children
[2:31:56] would grow up in
[2:31:57] [Music]
[2:32:01] and thank god that god had a
[2:32:02] relationship with him that he could
[2:32:04] touch him and say come look
[2:32:06] look again look at your sins
[2:32:10] look at this bumper of protection look
[2:32:13] at whenever you make a mistake it hits
[2:32:15] this bumper
[2:32:16] look at where i am i don't see it
[2:32:21] don't lose sight of jesus friends
[2:32:25] drop your oats
