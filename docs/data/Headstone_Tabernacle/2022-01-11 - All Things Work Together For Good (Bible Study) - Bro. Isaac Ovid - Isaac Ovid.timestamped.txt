[10:40] as we approach the throne of grace
[10:42] tonight
[10:44] and not just only for those who are here
[10:47] on the call but those who may not be
[10:49] here
[10:50] as well as to many who are connected to
[10:53] us during these trying times so let me
[10:55] just bow our heads forward of prayer
[10:58] almighty god we thank you tonight for
[11:01] your love
[11:03] for your grace for your mercy
[11:05] for your compassion for your
[11:07] faithfulness for your promises
[11:10] for your word
[11:11] lord that
[11:13] is keeping us alive and gives us hope
[11:16] and has brought us together
[11:18] lord there are so many
[11:20] lord ways that we could spend our time
[11:25] but i am comforted tonight that there is
[11:27] no better way tonight than in your
[11:30] presence
[11:31] lord gathering around your word
[11:34] your eternal word that gives us access
[11:37] to eternity
[11:38] father we thank you for today we thank
[11:41] you for life held for strength for being
[11:44] able to be here despite lord
[11:48] the so many obstacles and challenges we
[11:50] would have encountered today
[11:52] father we have still made it our
[11:54] business
[11:55] to be
[11:56] law accounted among them who have
[11:59] responded to this great call
[12:01] this call to perfection
[12:03] the call to the rapture the call to the
[12:05] resurrection
[12:06] lord and this study tonight lord is all
[12:09] part of that great divine plan
[12:12] lord to see further how we
[12:14] prioritize our time and how we could
[12:17] balance lord this this this this life of
[12:20] this balancing act
[12:22] lord of the commitments to family and to
[12:24] work and to school and to various
[12:26] obligations
[12:28] lord where you have instructed us to put
[12:30] you first so we report for duty tonight
[12:33] with that deep understanding that if we
[12:35] take care of your business father just
[12:38] as jesus had to be about his father's
[12:40] business that lord if we take care of
[12:42] your business father that you would get
[12:44] involved in our affairs and tonight
[12:47] father we give you permission lord as
[12:49] the prophet preached doors and doors he
[12:51] challenged us to open the doors of our
[12:54] homes our hearts our lives and to give
[12:56] you free reign lord to walk anywhere to
[12:59] touch anything to have an input and
[13:02] influence on every aspect of our lives
[13:04] so tonight we surrender our will to you
[13:06] we surrender our thoughts our ideas our
[13:09] feelings lord our challenges he's said
[13:11] to cast all our cares upon you
[13:14] so we come tonight to cast our cares
[13:16] upon you lord this may feel like a
[13:18] different setting because we are not
[13:20] physically in church and it might be a
[13:22] zoom meeting by law we thank you that
[13:24] you're a god of faith and that lord we
[13:27] serve a god of miracles we serve a god
[13:29] that is not limited by time or distance
[13:31] or technology father but we pray dear
[13:34] god that in this room where we could
[13:36] agree where two shall agree touching
[13:38] anything father we have many needs in
[13:40] the church tonight many people who lord
[13:42] are struggling physically lord the virus
[13:45] different conditions different
[13:46] situations we unite and fit for our
[13:49] brothers and sisters father that the
[13:51] healing rain lord will pour upon them
[13:53] that even as this bible study unfolds
[13:56] lord father healing would break forth
[13:58] father lord we don't know who's here
[14:00] tonight and who may join us along this
[14:02] journey for these few moments but father
[14:04] if there's someone who's desiring more
[14:06] of you
[14:07] may you speak to them may you give us
[14:09] courage and confidence through your word
[14:11] boldness lord to walk into your presence
[14:14] father may you lift our countenance and
[14:16] help us to square our shoulders back
[14:18] there's so much against us but it's also
[14:20] so much for us and value taught us that
[14:23] they are more for us than against us so
[14:25] our faith rests upon you tonight may you
[14:27] take me out of the way and encourage
[14:29] your people may you bless your people we
[14:31] thank you for our pastor tonight we
[14:33] thank you for the ministry we thank you
[14:35] for the believers who are here father we
[14:37] thank you for the visitors that may be
[14:38] among us we commit this bible study into
[14:41] your hands father and maybe all for your
[14:43] honor and for your glory in the precious
[14:45] name of jesus christ amen and amen and
[14:47] amen amen so certainly uh take yourself
[14:51] you know welcome one and all
[14:53] to our first uh bible study of 2022
[14:57] and
[14:58] um
[14:59] it is like the first day of school
[15:01] uh we are we are opening back um bible
[15:04] study and our time together in this
[15:07] informal
[15:08] setting to encourage us to inspire us
[15:11] and um and as we walk this journey of
[15:14] 2022 and all of the challenges and
[15:17] opportunities and hills and valleys that
[15:20] we have to navigate that we can do so
[15:22] with a spiritual mind a spiritual focus
[15:25] a spiritual understanding and with
[15:27] greater wisdom than 2020 and 2021 and
[15:31] 2022
[15:33] as we are here in this year
[15:35] we are challenged and encouraged that
[15:37] there's a great responsibility upon us
[15:39] because if you are here tonight it's
[15:41] because god still has a plan and a
[15:43] purpose for your life you know we are
[15:45] taught through the word
[15:48] that when god is finished with somebody
[15:50] he he can rest them down and give them
[15:52] that rest but if you are here it's
[15:54] because there's a purpose for your life
[15:55] so we want to embrace that purpose walk
[15:57] in that purpose understand that purpose
[15:59] and to be effective in
[16:01] our purpose
[16:03] so tonight it's somewhat of a
[16:05] introductory teaching it's a familiar
[16:09] body of scripture we're going to look at
[16:10] tonight but i want to really slow down
[16:13] um a bit on it tonight
[16:16] um and maybe in driving slowly as we
[16:19] have said in bible studies you know
[16:21] along familiar territory we may see
[16:23] things that we never really saw
[16:25] before so once again welcome to one and
[16:28] all
[16:29] and
[16:30] if you have your bibles it's bible study
[16:32] but we are going to be in romans 8
[16:35] tonight a very familiar scripture
[16:38] um
[16:39] but i'm excited tonight about what god
[16:42] is about to do for us so
[16:44] romans chapter 8 tonight
[16:47] and i have a title for the study and
[16:49] sometimes i give it to the beginning
[16:51] sometimes i give it to the end sometimes
[16:53] um you know we do different things but i
[16:56] want to call it all things
[16:58] work together for good bible study
[17:01] and really a study of romans 8. i don't
[17:03] know if the lord will allow us to get
[17:05] down to romans 8 28
[17:07] but we actually want to start from
[17:08] romans 8 plus 1
[17:11] and drive along this road so
[17:13] buckle your seat belts in get in the
[17:15] spirit separate itself from all
[17:17] distractions because i believe in my
[17:20] heart that what we are going to discuss
[17:22] tonight have a conversation around
[17:24] um can help push somebody closer to
[17:27] their understanding of what their
[17:29] expectations should be and by the way i
[17:31] want to salute god with a message on
[17:33] sunday by one's spirit we are baptized
[17:36] into one body and i'm connecting into
[17:39] that with this bible study as well
[17:41] to go you know along this this this line
[17:44] that we are on as well through his word
[17:46] so romans 8 and we know this is paul's
[17:49] letter to the romans and scattered
[17:52] through this book of romans
[17:54] it is a very
[17:55] i would call it a very complex book
[17:57] because paul says a lot
[17:59] um you know as you go through romans um
[18:03] he unfolds quite a number of things and
[18:06] you can miss it if you don't take your
[18:07] time and really look at it so paul as we
[18:10] know would have written letters to the
[18:12] various churches and to the church in
[18:15] rome would have been a very specific
[18:17] type of audience because although it is
[18:19] written
[18:20] you know to the romans
[18:22] um he would have referenced those that
[18:24] really understood the law that they
[18:26] understood what he was speaking about
[18:27] and we may get to that
[18:29] but let's start from romans 8 1
[18:32] and
[18:33] it starts really interesting
[18:36] he said there is therefore
[18:38] now
[18:40] no condemnation to them which are in
[18:43] christ jesus
[18:44] who walk not
[18:46] after the flesh but after the spirit
[18:49] i want to rewind this verse a little bit
[18:52] he said there is therefore now
[18:55] in mathematics
[18:57] therefore comes
[18:59] after you have done some good things and
[19:02] you are coming to a conclusion
[19:05] so paul is introducing romans 8.
[19:10] and he is actually basing it on
[19:12] arguments he would have made before
[19:14] so when you come to a halt or slow down
[19:17] he said there is therefore so in other
[19:19] words as a result of what i have said
[19:22] before
[19:24] in the amplified it actually says
[19:26] therefore there is now
[19:28] so in other words you can't even drive
[19:32] beyond romans 8 1
[19:34] without trying to understand what were
[19:37] the points or the arguments that paul
[19:39] made before romans 8 to where he's
[19:42] trying to go now i trust everybody is
[19:44] with me
[19:45] so he said there is therefore in other
[19:47] words as a result of certain things i've
[19:49] said before there is therefore now no
[19:52] condemnation
[19:54] so the first thing that paul is
[19:56] addressing
[19:58] is as a result of what i've said before
[20:00] there is now no condemnation
[20:04] so then you need to draw now to
[20:06] these key words no condemnation
[20:09] now this word condemnation that is found
[20:11] in romans 8 1
[20:14] paul
[20:15] only uses this word condemnation six
[20:17] times
[20:19] in all of the letters
[20:21] he uses this once when he is speaking to
[20:24] timothy but it was not addressing this
[20:26] issue of condemnation
[20:29] paul would use the word condemnation
[20:31] twice to the corinthians
[20:33] but he was not addressing this type of
[20:35] condemnation
[20:37] it is only in the book of romans and in
[20:39] only two
[20:40] specific chapters he is addressing the
[20:42] issue of condemnation
[20:45] so he is laying a foundation a powerful
[20:48] foundation for believers in romans 8 1
[20:52] by saying there is therefore so as a
[20:54] result of
[20:56] what have said before as a result of
[20:58] what i presented before
[21:00] there is now no condemnation and
[21:02] he addressed condemnation in romans 5
[21:07] where he said in romans 5 16 and 5 18
[21:10] and for bible scholars would remember
[21:12] this reference so romans 5 16 says and
[21:15] not as it was by one that sin the so is
[21:18] the gift
[21:19] for the judgment was by one to
[21:22] condemnation but the free gift is of
[21:25] many offenses under justification so in
[21:28] romans 5 is where paul was speaking
[21:31] about by by one man's sin
[21:34] all right and by and bringing that type
[21:36] there so he was he was bringing it there
[21:38] but i wanted to see to see something
[21:40] interesting here as well
[21:42] basically paul in romans 5 16
[21:46] was also given a clear definition by
[21:49] contrast of what he was speaking about
[21:51] with condemnation so i want to read it
[21:54] again to bring the contrast he said not
[21:56] as it was by one that sin so is the gift
[22:00] for the judgment was by one to
[22:02] condemnation so the judgment was the one
[22:05] by condemnation but the free gift is of
[22:08] many offenses unto justification so paul
[22:13] in romans 5 16 was making a comparison
[22:17] between two things
[22:19] that's really what he was doing there
[22:20] between condemnation and justification
[22:23] anybody with me all right so in other
[22:26] words for paul's argument the opposite
[22:29] of condemnation is justified the
[22:32] opposite of guilty is never did it not
[22:35] not guilty
[22:38] and that itself is powerful so the
[22:40] opposite for paul because justified is
[22:42] as he can never did it in the first
[22:44] place
[22:45] so paul was making a point here that
[22:48] condemnation the real opposite of
[22:49] condemnation in his spiritual sense is
[22:52] justification not
[22:54] just our not guilty verdict but you
[22:57] never do it in the first place all right
[22:59] so the other point is
[23:01] romans 5 18
[23:03] where he says therefore as by the
[23:05] offense of one judgment came upon all
[23:08] men to condemnation even so by the
[23:12] righteousness of one the free gift came
[23:15] upon all men unto justification of life
[23:18] so paul repeats it again that the
[23:20] opposite of condemnation is
[23:22] justification so now let's take it back
[23:25] into romans 8 1. in other words another
[23:27] way to say this because paul only used
[23:30] the word condemnation in a limited
[23:32] context
[23:33] but here is it again there is therefore
[23:35] now
[23:37] this could also be said as there is
[23:39] therefore now justification
[23:41] because he's bringing the contrast or
[23:43] you can say there's therefore now no
[23:44] condemnation
[23:46] to them which are in christ jesus just
[23:50] within this first verse and we could
[23:52] spend 20 minutes in this first verse
[23:55] it doesn't say those who are in church
[23:58] it doesn't say those who are in the
[24:00] message
[24:01] it doesn't say those who are even in the
[24:03] faith it says in christ jesus so i was
[24:06] trying to think about a way to present
[24:08] this that we can kind of see
[24:10] what paul is talking about here you know
[24:13] and i was looking at it like this if you
[24:15] are in your house there are certain
[24:18] things you can do
[24:20] there's certain benefits you could
[24:21] access
[24:22] if you are in your office
[24:25] so for example you might have faster
[24:28] internet speed in your office than in
[24:30] your home anybody with me
[24:33] so because you are in your office your
[24:36] access to do certain things might be
[24:38] greater than when you are in your home
[24:39] it sounds simple but i want us to really
[24:42] understand this in christ jesus thing
[24:45] because a lot of people don't understand
[24:47] what in christ jesus is because they are
[24:49] in church but they're not in christ
[24:50] jesus
[24:52] they're in the message but they're not
[24:53] in christ jesus
[24:55] they might believe but they're not in
[24:57] christ jesus but paul is also qualifying
[25:00] what his research is referring to
[25:02] if you are in the park
[25:04] or you're in the country you might have
[25:06] different cell phone reception and if
[25:08] you're in the city
[25:10] where you are in has an impact on what
[25:12] you could access
[25:14] can i say that one more time
[25:16] where you are has an impact on what you
[25:19] could access
[25:21] so paul is saying there's therefore as a
[25:24] result of what i've said before now now
[25:27] no condemnation to them which are in
[25:29] christ jesus
[25:30] who walk not after the flesh
[25:34] but after the spirit
[25:36] in the amplified it says therefore there
[25:39] is now no condemnation no guilty verdict
[25:42] no punishment for those who are in
[25:45] christ jesus who believe in him as
[25:48] personal lord and savior
[25:50] and then verse two
[25:52] for the law of the spirit of life in
[25:55] christ jesus
[25:57] have made me free from the law
[26:00] of sin and death
[26:02] now we read this many times but i want
[26:04] to slow down again because paul is
[26:06] highlighting there are two laws that are
[26:09] at work
[26:11] and these two laws need to be satisfied
[26:14] because every law needs to be satisfied
[26:17] so let's take it for the law of the
[26:19] spirit of life in christ so there's a
[26:21] law of the spirit hallelujah and there's
[26:25] a law of sin and death
[26:28] the law of sin and death we understood
[26:30] as moses law or the mosaic law
[26:33] and paul in the book of romans would
[26:35] have spent a lot of time talking about
[26:37] the the issues around the law but he's
[26:40] saying for the law of the spirit of life
[26:42] you know in other words this this new
[26:45] law because they cannot operate outside
[26:47] of law
[26:48] so there there's always a law so we're
[26:50] not dealing with legalism versus not
[26:52] having a law it is a different kind of
[26:55] law so is the law of moses which was
[26:58] rules and do's and don'ts so a different
[27:01] kind of law for the law of the spirit of
[27:04] life in christ jesus
[27:06] had made me free so this is not a law to
[27:09] trap you or to keep you in chains this
[27:11] is the law that gives you access to
[27:13] freedom in fact it has made me free from
[27:17] the law of sin and debt in the amplified
[27:20] we're building into something don't
[27:21] worry for the law of the spirit of life
[27:25] which is in christ jesus the law of our
[27:28] new being
[27:31] has set you free from the law of sin and
[27:33] of death
[27:35] and we have to appreciate and understand
[27:37] that the law that we're talking about
[27:40] could not have brought change in our
[27:42] behavior
[27:44] and if we could appreciate this tonight
[27:46] this is why being born again is so
[27:49] important this is why by one spirit
[27:51] being baptized into the body is so
[27:54] important because the law as paul said
[27:57] only with highlights
[27:59] would only make to your knowledge what
[28:01] you're doing wrong anybody with me
[28:07] for the law of the spirit of life in
[28:10] christ jesus had made me free from the
[28:12] law of sin
[28:16] and that
[28:18] verse 3
[28:19] for what the law could not do
[28:23] in that it was weak through the flesh
[28:26] and i was thinking even within the
[28:28] context of what we have become used to
[28:30] in in our day now
[28:32] the law says
[28:34] put on a mask
[28:35] but the law
[28:37] in and of itself has no power to make
[28:39] you do it in them
[28:44] law is written the law is announced in
[28:46] isolation the law
[28:48] has no power to actually enforce without
[28:52] enforcement
[28:53] the law is almost it has no real value
[28:57] unless you take the law and apply it to
[29:00] you the law itself is weak
[29:03] anybody with me
[29:04] because the law is outside of us
[29:08] but when the enforcement and is the fear
[29:10] of enforcement that makes a law severe
[29:13] or not severe
[29:15] so that is why a law now could be
[29:17] ticketable or there are no consequences
[29:19] because if the law has no consequence
[29:22] most people when you see the law you'll
[29:24] feel like what that had no impact on me
[29:28] many people that's why they're driving
[29:29] and the mass don't women see the poor
[29:31] police why why don't leave the mass down
[29:37] but is when you see the enforcement of
[29:39] the law it suddenly makes the law seem
[29:42] more powerful because you know that when
[29:44] of enforcement connects with the law is
[29:47] a different situation
[29:48] so paul is saying here for what the law
[29:51] could not do
[29:53] in other words
[29:54] for years the law was there it's not
[29:57] that the law was not there
[29:58] the law was there saying what you could
[30:00] do what you could not do how to live how
[30:03] to live and and how to adjust your life
[30:05] it was there it was not that it was not
[30:06] there but the law was weak
[30:09] because no matter how much knowledge you
[30:12] had of the law
[30:14] there was no power in the law to really
[30:17] change your behavior
[30:19] the law was always going to require
[30:22] enforcement
[30:23] the law was always going to create a
[30:25] situation that you're going to never
[30:26] live up to the law because the
[30:28] requirements of the law was set in such
[30:30] a way
[30:32] that it would only highlight what your
[30:34] issues were but not provide a solution
[30:38] to bring you into compliance with the
[30:40] law
[30:41] anybody with me
[30:43] to say it the way paul said it
[30:46] paul said
[30:48] in in romans 7 7
[30:50] what shall we say then is the lost sin
[30:53] god forbid
[30:55] nay i had not known sin
[30:57] but by the law in other words
[31:00] if it wasn't for the law i would not
[31:03] have even known
[31:04] that i was in sin
[31:09] anybody hear me my is my connection
[31:12] working
[31:17] it's fine
[31:19] okay
[31:20] so paul is saying if it was not for the
[31:23] law i would not have even known for paul
[31:25] saying in romans 7 7 for i had not known
[31:28] lust
[31:29] except the law had said thou shalt not
[31:32] covet
[31:34] so paul is saying it was law that made
[31:36] me aware
[31:38] of my condition
[31:40] and the law that also made me aware of
[31:43] my condition created guilt
[31:46] created shame but did not provide a
[31:49] solution
[31:50] as much as i tried to meet the
[31:52] requirement of the law the law could not
[31:55] give me a solution so this is what makes
[31:58] the law weak
[31:59] and i want this to help believe us
[32:01] tonight
[32:02] because if you only look at the law of
[32:05] moses and the rules and trying to match
[32:08] the law the letter of the law without
[32:10] the spirit you will find yourself in
[32:12] this cycle of trying to figure out why
[32:15] you're not living a certain kind of a
[32:17] life
[32:19] so paul here in romans is introducing
[32:22] the critical importance
[32:24] not of abandoning the law but of a
[32:27] higher law that required his spirit now
[32:31] because the law that was the law of
[32:33] moses which was an external law was
[32:36] being superseded by another law which is
[32:39] driven by the spirit
[32:41] he call it the law of the spirit
[32:44] because when you're living by the law of
[32:46] the spirit it is no longer a weak law
[32:50] that's trying to get you to conform to
[32:52] the law but it's not the spirit in the
[32:54] driver's seat changing your behavior so
[32:57] it's not forcing you as a believer to
[33:00] meet a standard that seems impossible
[33:03] it is the spirit living its natural way
[33:06] oh come on now anybody with me
[33:09] so it is not trying to fit a a a a shape
[33:13] into another shape and and you're
[33:14] shining and you're stretching you you're
[33:16] trying to drag yourself to live a
[33:18] certain way and and fight delivery to me
[33:20] it's not that anymore because under the
[33:22] law of sin and debt you could do your
[33:24] very best and your very best quite
[33:26] honestly is not enough because the law
[33:29] had no power to give you strength to
[33:31] overcome
[33:33] but this new law we're talking about
[33:35] call the law of the spirit of life
[33:38] in christ jesus once again
[33:41] in christ jesus is the only place this
[33:43] law begins to apply i want us to get
[33:45] this tonight
[33:48] it is only in christ jesus this law
[33:51] begins applying are you in christ jesus
[33:54] tonight
[33:56] are you swimming are you are you inside
[33:58] this thing fully
[34:00] this is not a message to people who who
[34:02] half within
[34:04] and who not sure and who not trying this
[34:07] is people who want to dive deep
[34:10] and and you really want to get all of
[34:13] this
[34:14] i'm not talking about church tonight
[34:17] and i even talk about belief i'm talking
[34:18] about in christ jesus because the more
[34:22] you go in him
[34:23] all of your natural desires begin to
[34:25] fear and paul goes into that because
[34:27] he's building up this argument to get
[34:29] her somewhere anybody with me
[34:33] let's go
[34:35] for what the law could not do
[34:40] in that it was weak through the flesh
[34:43] god
[34:44] sending his own son
[34:47] in the likeness of sinful flesh
[34:51] and forcing
[34:53] condemning in the flesh
[34:55] i want us to take that slowly because
[34:57] this is important
[34:59] we've read it what between but i wanted
[35:01] to get it in the amplified it says for
[35:03] what the law could not do
[35:06] that is and listen to what the amplifier
[35:08] says is that is overcome sin and remove
[35:11] its penalty its power
[35:13] so the law was telling you what you
[35:16] should be and what you should live and
[35:17] what you could not do and should do
[35:20] but the law
[35:21] could not give you the ability to
[35:23] actually overcome sin
[35:26] the law was only telling you what to do
[35:28] and not do do this don't do this do this
[35:31] don't do this but you were coming to
[35:33] church trying to figure out how do i
[35:35] overcome
[35:37] how do i live
[35:39] how do i do what i'm supposed to do and
[35:42] how do i not do what i'm not supposed to
[35:44] do anybody with me so the law could not
[35:48] help you to overcome sin and remove its
[35:50] penalty its power
[35:52] being weakened by the flesh because you
[35:55] were born in sin shape and iniquity this
[35:59] law was actually
[36:01] never you were never going to be able to
[36:03] overcome this this mosaic law
[36:06] in your natural flesh condition it is
[36:09] impossible that is why outside of the
[36:11] holy ghost
[36:13] there's no way you could ever live a
[36:15] perfect life oh come on now i hope i
[36:16] hope i hope this this starter resonates
[36:19] outside the holy ghost
[36:21] you could go and live in a mountain for
[36:23] years
[36:25] and not watch no tv no phone nothing at
[36:28] all
[36:29] the moment you come out of the sterile
[36:31] environment the law
[36:33] of sin and debt meets the flesh and all
[36:36] of a sudden you see the gap between your
[36:39] flesh and the law
[36:42] of sin and death
[36:44] because god didn't want it to ever be by
[36:47] your ability in this flesh to meet a
[36:50] higher law
[36:52] but what the law could not do that is
[36:54] overcome sin and remove its penalty
[36:57] its power being weakened by the flesh
[37:01] and listen in the amplified
[37:03] man's nature without the holy spirit
[37:09] if this does set anybody free
[37:12] with understanding the critical
[37:14] importance because the difference
[37:16] between the law of mosaic the mosaic law
[37:18] or the law of sin and that and the law
[37:20] of the spirit of life is only one
[37:22] distinction you know
[37:24] one is no spirit involved and the other
[37:27] you live in by the spirit and once
[37:29] you're living by the spirit this natural
[37:32] law of sin and death you it's under your
[37:34] feet
[37:35] because you have been caught up in a
[37:36] higher law because you are in christ
[37:39] is there anybody struggling to overcome
[37:41] then this is the message for you because
[37:43] it should create such a desire in you
[37:45] for the holy ghost a desire in you for a
[37:49] new walk a new life
[37:51] anybody with me tonight
[37:54] listen so again we still in verse 3
[37:58] for what the law could not do paul is
[38:00] making it clear
[38:02] no matter how much books you read how
[38:04] much tapes you listen to
[38:07] how much you know the law how much you
[38:09] understand the law how much you believe
[38:12] the law how much you receive the law how
[38:15] much you know how to dress how to speak
[38:17] how to live the law and what defines the
[38:20] law there will always be a gap that
[38:23] could never be met because the law
[38:25] itself is weak
[38:26] to give you the ability to live a holy
[38:29] life
[38:31] holiness cannot be legislated
[38:36] holiness cannot be by rules and
[38:38] regulations
[38:39] young people caleb's get this holiness
[38:42] could never be by the law the law does
[38:45] not have the ability to bring you into a
[38:48] level of compliance with god
[38:50] but
[38:51] god didn't leave us just with the law of
[38:54] sin and death by the law of the spirit
[38:57] of life which can only come by the holy
[39:00] ghost you have accessed in christ to a
[39:04] higher power that is no longer about
[39:07] rules and regulations and do's and
[39:10] don'ts but the nature of christ because
[39:12] you are in christ living
[39:15] his life out of you
[39:17] it is not difficult when you are in
[39:20] christ and in the holy ghost to live a
[39:22] holy life because it's christ living out
[39:24] of you
[39:26] this is why friends it is impossible for
[39:29] somebody to tell me they have the holy
[39:31] ghost or they are adopted or they have
[39:33] the spirit and they cannot live a holy
[39:35] life because the holy ghost will make
[39:38] you live a holy life that's why brother
[39:40] branham said that's what the holy ghost
[39:42] is given for
[39:47] anybody with me
[39:50] so you can lay along rules in the church
[39:53] the law is limited
[39:56] it brings you to knowledge you didn't
[39:58] know it was wrong you didn't know he was
[40:00] in sin that's what the law does it
[40:02] highlights it and paul said it in romans
[40:04] 7 he said i didn't know until the law
[40:06] came i didn't even know what my issue
[40:08] was so the law comes a highlighted issue
[40:11] and it brings you to repentance but
[40:13] repentance is still not the spirit oh
[40:16] come on now coming into your life
[40:20] you can repent every day and it is a
[40:22] requirement to repent but it is still
[40:25] different when the spirit comes into
[40:27] your life
[40:33] are still in verse 3
[40:35] this is romans 8 that we have read
[40:37] hundreds of times right for what the law
[40:40] could not do
[40:42] so it is impossible this is why legalism
[40:45] young people in church for years
[40:47] and the moment they get to exit a hatch
[40:50] and i preach this before you take the
[40:51] pig
[40:53] you lock the pig in the house you close
[40:55] the door you close the window the pig
[40:58] with no access to mud
[41:00] has no mud to go and play with the pig
[41:03] suddenly becomes domesticated you put
[41:05] cologne on the pig you put a few monday
[41:08] pig you bear the pig you put deodorant
[41:11] on the pig you put on your pants you put
[41:13] in a suit you put in a tie you give him
[41:15] a spoken word book you give him a bible
[41:17] you carry him to bible study he will
[41:20] behave he will shout he will jump
[41:22] because he in the environment but the
[41:25] day
[41:26] you'll leave the door open and the pigs
[41:28] see the mud outside
[41:30] he is dropping the bible dropping this
[41:33] word book because you kept him
[41:35] living under the law of sin and death
[41:37] unless that pig is changed to alarm oh
[41:41] god somebody help me tonight unless that
[41:43] pig has a change of nature and now
[41:46] accepts the existence and the power of a
[41:49] higher law
[41:51] all you can do is lock him up in
[41:52] legislation
[41:55] that can never work
[41:57] anybody with me tonight
[41:59] i don't know if this helping somebody
[42:01] but if this doesn't give you a hunger
[42:04] for lord i want the holy ghost lord i
[42:06] want a spiritual experience lord i know
[42:09] the books i know the tips i know the law
[42:12] i know the expectation i know the
[42:14] standard because brother branham taught
[42:16] us his standard a perfect church a truth
[42:18] without spot and wrinkle that is clear
[42:21] that is clear there's no compromise to
[42:23] that we're not going anywhere less than
[42:24] that but there has to be a way to get
[42:27] there and there's only one way that is
[42:28] by the holy ghost
[42:30] can the church say amen
[42:34] are still in verse 3
[42:36] for what the law could not do in that it
[42:38] was weak through the flesh god
[42:41] sending his own son in the likeness of
[42:45] sinful flesh in other words likeness is
[42:49] the difference between jesus and us
[42:54] likeness of sinful flesh
[42:57] so like us
[42:59] in that he looking like sinful flesh
[43:02] dressing like sinful flesh feeling the
[43:05] exhaustion of sinful flesh feeling the
[43:08] emotional stress and turmoil like when
[43:11] lazarus died the sinful flesh the
[43:14] tiredness in the boat
[43:18] but i like how the amplified says it
[43:22] for what the law could not do that is
[43:24] overcome sin and remove its penalty its
[43:27] power being weakened by the flesh
[43:31] man's nature without the holy spirit
[43:34] god did that's what i'm gonna say god
[43:36] did it in other words god provide the
[43:38] solution it is not my solution it is not
[43:42] your solution he himself because listen
[43:45] friends
[43:46] i love to say this god is limited
[43:49] by his own law
[43:52] my
[43:54] so god cannot lie because he his own law
[43:57] there's some things
[43:59] god could do everything yes but there's
[44:00] some things god cannot do he cannot lie
[44:03] and god cannot come back on his own word
[44:06] that's why when he speaks a word over
[44:08] your life
[44:09] he can't even take the word back
[44:11] or you don't hear me tonight
[44:14] when god bless you he kind of unduty
[44:17] blessing
[44:18] because already spoken when the arrow of
[44:21] blessing the arrow of deliverance leaves
[44:23] and heads to your house god can't even
[44:25] stop it
[44:28] that is that's the kind of god we serve
[44:30] so when god said the law required
[44:32] payment
[44:33] the law of sin and death required sin
[44:35] and death
[44:37] god said the only way i could give them
[44:40] a chance in 2022
[44:42] is to close the loop on the old law
[44:45] to open the door to the new law
[44:48] so the first law had to be satisfied
[44:51] so god looked for a way to satisfy the
[44:53] first law of sin and debt
[44:56] and
[44:57] send his own son
[44:59] in the likeness of sin
[45:01] oh come on now and say i have the answer
[45:05] god created law and he closed the loop
[45:08] on his own law
[45:10] because if he didn't close the loop you
[45:12] don't have a chance i don't have a
[45:14] chance you see why you're supposed to be
[45:15] bold and confident to go to ask god for
[45:18] what you need tonight
[45:20] because god wants you to come to him he
[45:22] wants you to ask him he wants to heal
[45:24] you he wants to fill you he wants to
[45:26] give you the holy ghost he wants to open
[45:28] your understanding he wants you to live
[45:30] a victorious life and he didn't leave it
[45:33] up to you to figure it out he said i
[45:35] have a law here that requires sin and
[45:37] death so i'm going to send my own son
[45:41] hallelujah
[45:43] in the likeness of sinful flesh and for
[45:46] sin that's his purpose to deal with sin
[45:50] but this is what happened
[45:53] in the amplified well in the king james
[45:55] it says
[45:58] condemn sin in the flesh and he
[46:00] amplified it says it he sent his own son
[46:04] in the likeness of sinful man
[46:06] as an offering for sin
[46:08] and he this man called jesus
[46:11] did what no other man before had ever
[46:14] done he condemned sin in the flesh
[46:19] moses couldn't do it
[46:20] abraham couldn't do it
[46:22] elijah couldn't do it
[46:25] in the amplified it says jesus he
[46:28] subdued it
[46:29] and overcame it in the person of his own
[46:32] son in other words god sent a
[46:34] representative
[46:36] to take blame and that a representative
[46:38] would take blame subdued it this thing
[46:41] called sin and overcame it bring sin
[46:44] into captivity bring sin into subjection
[46:48] bring sin under control tell sin where
[46:51] to get off tell sin he had no power that
[46:54] he could walk the earth in the likeness
[46:57] of sinful flesh
[46:59] and not give into temptation
[47:02] not given to doubt not given to lust not
[47:05] given to pornography not given to lying
[47:09] not given to oh come on now the lust of
[47:11] the eye the lust of the flesh
[47:13] and the bible said he was tempted just
[47:15] as we are tempted but did not sin he
[47:19] told sin a lesson
[47:21] he told sin listen i don't have to bend
[47:23] to you
[47:25] come on now
[47:29] and he was not doing that for himself he
[47:31] was doing that to release another law
[47:35] a lot in other words god knew that
[47:39] because the law had no power or the
[47:42] reverse of that you had no power to meet
[47:44] the requirement of the law or the law or
[47:46] the power of the law was ineffective to
[47:49] change you he had to bring another type
[47:51] of law that could give you power to meet
[47:54] the requirements of the law
[47:56] anybody with me
[48:01] is this helping anybody is this
[48:04] i know he's not a character we only hear
[48:06] but right now i'm not on our bible
[48:08] character
[48:09] i'm on you as the character you being
[48:11] changed from the law of sin and death
[48:14] that sin and death have no power over
[48:17] you do you know you could walk over sin
[48:19] and walk over that and look at him and
[48:22] look at that no wonder paul could say
[48:24] hey death where's your sting grave
[48:27] where's your victory because he was
[48:28] walking in this spirit he was in christ
[48:31] he was fully confident fully persuaded
[48:36] we're still there
[48:39] so
[48:40] are still in verse three
[48:42] and verse three ends with a
[48:45] colon
[48:46] which means what comes after is related
[48:49] to verse 3. so verse 4
[48:52] is dependent on verse 3
[48:54] so it is basically saying that god did
[48:58] this for a purpose and it tells you what
[49:00] the purpose is that the righteousness of
[49:04] the law
[49:05] hallelujah this impossible righteousness
[49:09] the requirement of being righteous
[49:11] concerning the law which could have
[49:14] never been fulfilled under the old
[49:16] structure of the law was now made
[49:19] possible because of what god did through
[49:22] christ
[49:23] no wonder poor can say there is
[49:25] therefore now no condemnation
[49:30] verse 4 that the righteousness of the
[49:33] law might be fulfilled in us who walk
[49:37] not after the flesh but after the spirit
[49:41] all right i want to read that in the
[49:42] amplified so that the righteous and just
[49:46] requirement of the law
[49:48] might be fulfilled in us
[49:50] in other words god's law still has a
[49:53] requirement to know but god now made it
[49:55] possible
[49:56] truly holy spirit
[49:58] for us to live to the standard of the
[50:00] law in other words
[50:02] you don't need police to keep you in
[50:04] line no more
[50:07] you you you you don't need that anymore
[50:10] you just find yourself in line
[50:13] because the police move from the outside
[50:16] to the inside
[50:18] or you you don't hear me you don't have
[50:20] to wait
[50:22] most most people their behavior change
[50:25] when they see enforcement or somebody
[50:28] and and all of a sudden the external
[50:30] presence of something makes you line up
[50:33] god wanted to move it from the outside
[50:35] to the police on being on the outside
[50:37] but he pulled it's been on the inside so
[50:39] the governance is now on the inside so
[50:42] so you don't have no problem to live a
[50:44] holy life because the police on the
[50:45] inside anybody with me
[50:48] so let's go
[50:50] first five
[50:51] for they that are after the flesh
[50:55] do mind the things of the flesh what are
[50:57] you after tonight
[51:02] but they that are after the spirit the
[51:04] things of the spirit in the amplified
[51:06] for those who are living
[51:09] according to the flesh
[51:11] set their minds on the things of the
[51:14] flesh which gratify the body
[51:17] but those who are living according to
[51:19] the spirit
[51:20] set their minds on the things of the
[51:23] spirit his will and purpose that's why
[51:25] we are here tonight
[51:26] we want to be connected to his will and
[51:29] his purpose we have plenty other things
[51:31] we could be doing
[51:32] there are people tonight who have no
[51:34] excuse for not being here what are they
[51:36] focused on what's the rare reason
[51:40] the separation of bride and
[51:42] fullest version and why virgin is not
[51:45] it's not me separating it's not
[51:47] is is your behavior is your conduct is
[51:49] your preparation is your attitude it's
[51:51] your approach
[51:52] so paul is saying here
[51:54] for they that are after the flesh do
[51:57] mind the things that of the flesh but
[51:59] they that are after these pretty things
[52:01] of the spirit verse six
[52:03] for to be carnally minded is death
[52:07] but to be spiritually minded is life and
[52:10] peace
[52:11] could somebody describe you as
[52:13] spiritually minded
[52:16] do you make decisions that are that are
[52:18] that are that are in alignment with
[52:20] somebody who is spiritually minded or is
[52:23] it carnally minded
[52:26] in the amplified it says now the mind of
[52:29] the flesh is death
[52:31] both now and forever because it pursues
[52:33] sin but the mind of the spirit is life
[52:36] and peace
[52:37] the spiritual well-being that comes from
[52:41] walking with god
[52:43] both now and forever
[52:46] what's the subject of your conversation
[52:48] you hear people say hey he real carnal
[52:50] boy
[52:52] what does that mean somebody cannot
[52:55] it means their conversation
[52:58] is down a road
[52:59] that has a certain slant a certain
[53:01] tendency that they like it yeah you have
[53:04] people when you talk with them even
[53:06] though they talk about spiritual things
[53:07] they get quiet quite quiet
[53:10] but they start to talk about the
[53:11] politics and talk about this and talk
[53:14] about that all of a sudden you see them
[53:15] light up they're excited
[53:17] because that is what they are tuned to
[53:18] their mind they they
[53:22] everything is exciting but they say well
[53:24] but let me talk about the lord until
[53:26] there's a
[53:27] it's a whole different behavior what
[53:30] don't you understand god is looking at
[53:31] that and paul is making is making it
[53:33] very very very clear right
[53:37] verse 8
[53:38] so then
[53:39] they that in are in the flesh cannot
[53:43] please god
[53:48] in the amplified that says and those who
[53:49] are in the flesh listen to what it means
[53:52] living a life
[53:54] that caters
[53:55] to sinful appetites and impulses cannot
[53:59] please god
[54:03] where do you stand tonight are you
[54:05] living a life to please god
[54:07] we still in romans eight tonight this is
[54:09] still the same chapter where all things
[54:10] work together for good
[54:12] we're building up to that we'll get
[54:14] we'll rejoice in that part
[54:16] but we're talking about there's a
[54:18] journey to get there
[54:21] and that journey is that separation
[54:23] between the carnal flesh
[54:26] struggling to live to the lord kind of
[54:28] man
[54:29] and the man who has been converted
[54:31] by the spirit
[54:33] by the holy ghost to live under a new
[54:35] law
[54:36] that now becomes easy to live so people
[54:38] can't understand how you're making it
[54:40] anybody with me
[54:42] let's go
[54:44] but ye are not in the flesh
[54:47] so this is now paul encouraging them now
[54:50] so challenging them now
[54:51] ye are not in the flesh but in the
[54:54] spirit if so be that the spirit of god
[54:56] dwell in you dwell in you in you this
[55:00] thing need to be in you
[55:03] again if you don't have the holy ghost
[55:06] tonight
[55:08] what are you doing about it
[55:11] can you say the holy ghost can you hear
[55:13] about all this message
[55:15] sunday
[55:18] a little bit red certain powerful quotes
[55:21] about there's a difference between a
[55:23] christian
[55:25] and a holy ghost failed christian
[55:30] nobody questioning if you're a christian
[55:33] nobody questioning if you love your lord
[55:36] nobody questioning if you believe the
[55:38] message but are you a holy ghost filled
[55:41] christian
[55:42] is the holy ghost pulsating in your soul
[55:46] is the police inside your heart or the
[55:48] police outside
[55:50] if when they see your brother or sister
[55:51] on the street you're fixing your clothes
[55:53] and and you're fixing this and fixing
[55:54] that it comes in that brush is the
[55:57] police in them because the control tower
[55:59] are not on the inside
[56:02] oh don't make me don't don't make me
[56:04] don't maybe come to your homes tonight
[56:06] come and take everybody home at the same
[56:08] time
[56:10] if you have to change your music
[56:12] when a believer is around you
[56:14] then it means the police not on the
[56:16] inside the police clearly on the outside
[56:21] if you have to change your conversation
[56:23] when somebody else comes around
[56:27] anybody with me
[56:30] then it'd be the police on the outside
[56:32] and not on the inside
[56:37] we have to be able to live a holy life
[56:40] when nobody else is watching
[56:43] and that only comes from the holy ghost
[56:47] anybody with me
[57:00] who's 10
[57:02] are you hearing me tonight
[57:19] yes we're here in isaac
[57:21] and if christ be in you
[57:23] again
[57:24] it is not
[57:26] you having a kind of relationship but if
[57:29] christ be in you
[57:31] the body is dead
[57:33] because of sin
[57:35] but the spirit of life is the spirit is
[57:38] life because of righteousness
[57:41] but if the spirit of him and rays of
[57:44] jesus from the dead dwell in you he that
[57:46] raised up christ from the dead shall
[57:49] also quicken your mortal bodies by his
[57:53] spirit that dwell it in you and friends
[57:58] this here is so powerful because this
[58:01] closes the gap
[58:03] in this time when people don't know
[58:04] where they're standing and gross
[58:06] darkness and death talk in the land it
[58:09] is so important to know that the spirit
[58:11] of god is in you
[58:13] because if it is this mortal body have
[58:15] to fall with this mortal body need to
[58:17] follow the spirit
[58:20] because if the spirit is in you then
[58:23] this spirit shall quicken the mortal
[58:25] body
[58:26] by the spirit that dwell in you
[58:31] so the real christian the holy ghost
[58:33] christian doesn't fear death tonight
[58:37] can i say that one more time
[58:39] the holy ghost feel christian don't fear
[58:41] that because the holy ghost christian
[58:43] understand that if your spirit is in you
[58:46] that spirit will quicken this mortal
[58:48] body
[58:51] so paul is building a powerful this
[58:54] whole everything you read so far is
[58:55] about the importance of the holy ghost
[58:59] and how desperate we ought to be to make
[59:01] sure we can live this thing
[59:04] therefore bridging we are debtors not to
[59:06] the flesh to live after the flesh for if
[59:09] you live after the flesh ye shall die
[59:13] and that die is not going on that's real
[59:15] death separation from god but if you
[59:18] or ye through the spirit do mortify the
[59:22] deeds of the body ye shall live
[59:26] and be going into familiar territory i'm
[59:28] not going to be too much longer with you
[59:31] for as many as are led by the spirit of
[59:34] god we know this
[59:35] they are the sons
[59:38] of god
[59:40] hallelujah
[59:43] for all and listen to this amplified for
[59:46] all who are allowing themselves to be
[59:49] led by the spirit of god
[59:53] so this for as many as are led is just
[59:56] beyond seeing many let alone but
[59:58] allowing the spirit to lead them
[1:00:01] not allowing because being led sheep are
[1:00:04] meant to be led people allowing the
[1:00:07] neighbor the boss the friend somebody
[1:00:10] else to lead them into all kind of
[1:00:11] places
[1:00:12] are you allowing the spirit to lead you
[1:00:16] if you're supposed to be in bible time
[1:00:17] tonight and you find yourself doing
[1:00:19] something else who lead and who
[1:00:21] who leading you you've got the spirit
[1:00:24] supposed to lead you to closer to god
[1:00:27] to one to have your walk your your
[1:00:29] thinking your behavior your motive your
[1:00:31] objective in the right place right for
[1:00:33] as many as and i love how the amplified
[1:00:36] positions it
[1:00:38] for all who are allowing themselves to
[1:00:40] be led by the spirit of god not
[1:00:43] hollywood not the news not netflix not
[1:00:46] movies not well because other people are
[1:00:49] doing it i can do that
[1:00:52] they are allowing
[1:00:53] themselves to be led by the spirit of
[1:00:55] god i want to nail her down and um
[1:00:59] because when people behave a certain
[1:01:01] kind of way that is not christ like
[1:01:04] something else is leading them
[1:01:08] the reason paul have to make this
[1:01:10] statement is to clarify who the sons of
[1:01:13] god are
[1:01:16] we have read the scripture many times
[1:01:18] but paul is saying
[1:01:19] for as many in other words only the ones
[1:01:23] who allow themselves to be led
[1:01:26] by the spirit of god they're not moving
[1:01:28] because of the group they're not moving
[1:01:30] because of people they're being led by
[1:01:32] the spirit of god who is leading you
[1:01:34] tonight
[1:01:37] who is leading you in your
[1:01:38] decision-making are you seeking the
[1:01:40] spirit of god are you looking for god to
[1:01:43] guide your decisions or are you leaning
[1:01:45] on are you leading yourself
[1:01:49] where are you getting advice and counsel
[1:01:51] from
[1:01:52] we are the beginning of a new year and
[1:01:54] we are challenging ourselves to be
[1:01:57] sensitive to the holy spirit
[1:02:00] not our ideas
[1:02:01] our ideas we get us in trouble our
[1:02:03] feelings get in trouble are we
[1:02:04] emotionally in trouble
[1:02:09] for we have not received you know this
[1:02:11] the spirit of bondage again to fear
[1:02:16] but you have received the spirit of
[1:02:17] adoption whereby we cry our father
[1:02:22] for you have not received a spirit so
[1:02:25] bear in mind now the context of this
[1:02:27] because all along we're talking about
[1:02:29] the law of sin and of death we talk
[1:02:31] about the spirit of life and this new
[1:02:33] spirit
[1:02:34] and this here is in the context of
[1:02:36] everything paul is saying so he's now
[1:02:39] making clarity and distinction about
[1:02:41] this spirit that you're receiving
[1:02:44] the spirit that you're getting here that
[1:02:46] we're talking about here is not a spirit
[1:02:49] of bondage
[1:02:50] again to fear
[1:02:52] the spirit you're getting little and
[1:02:54] listening to the in the amplified it
[1:02:57] says for you have not received a spirit
[1:02:59] of slavery
[1:03:01] leading again to fear of god's judgment
[1:03:03] in other words the spirit is not about
[1:03:06] fear in god's judgment
[1:03:08] but you have received the spirit of
[1:03:10] adoption as sons which is the spirit in
[1:03:14] the amplified producing sonship
[1:03:20] so the production of sonship is only by
[1:03:23] the spirit
[1:03:25] not by how much years any message or how
[1:03:27] much books you read or even your
[1:03:29] understanding of the word and the
[1:03:30] unfolding of the mystery that is not
[1:03:32] producing sons
[1:03:35] what is distinguishing sons from
[1:03:37] everybody else is being led by the
[1:03:39] spirit and the spirit
[1:03:42] actually producing sons
[1:03:47] for he has not received a spirit of
[1:03:48] bunnies again to fear but he have
[1:03:50] received his spirit of adoption
[1:03:52] whereby we cry our father
[1:03:55] verse 16 the spirit itself
[1:03:58] bearing witness with our spirits that we
[1:04:02] are children of god oh i love that
[1:04:05] the spirit himself listens to the
[1:04:08] amplified testifies
[1:04:10] and confirms together with our spirit
[1:04:13] that we believers are children of god in
[1:04:16] other words the spirit in you has a
[1:04:18] voice
[1:04:20] that is in alignment with your own
[1:04:23] declaration that you are son of god
[1:04:26] anybody here tonight believe their son
[1:04:28] or daughter of god
[1:04:31] we have to believe it we have to claim
[1:04:33] it we have to say it
[1:04:34] so not only does god want us to declare
[1:04:37] that we are sons and daughters of god
[1:04:39] and but the spirit itself
[1:04:41] will also join your voice oh come on now
[1:04:45] and say yes this is the sun
[1:04:48] so it's not just you declaring i'm a son
[1:04:51] but a spirit itself
[1:04:53] will be a witness that you are a son
[1:04:56] so god has a double entry confirmation
[1:04:59] system
[1:05:01] so you and the spirit will be saying the
[1:05:03] same thing that your son
[1:05:05] anybody with me
[1:05:07] oh my if that doesn't give you
[1:05:09] confidence and assurance because listen
[1:05:11] you could be questioning yourself
[1:05:15] and wondering
[1:05:16] but the spirit itself brings and listen
[1:05:20] listen to the amplified this here is
[1:05:22] gold
[1:05:23] listen carefully here the spirit himself
[1:05:26] testifies and confirms together with our
[1:05:29] spirit listen in the original
[1:05:31] translation assuring us
[1:05:35] that we believe as a children of god
[1:05:37] so you might be there tonight saying boy
[1:05:39] i listen to this thing and i wonder if
[1:05:41] i'm gonna make it i wonder if i'm a son
[1:05:43] i'm a son and i'm a son and you're there
[1:05:45] holding on hoping that at somehow this
[1:05:47] thing could ring true
[1:05:49] and the bible is saying paul is saying
[1:05:51] the spirit will confirm give you
[1:05:54] assurance give you confirmation
[1:05:56] because god knows sometimes you wonder
[1:05:59] sometimes you're there you're upside
[1:06:00] down story of our loop but his spirit is
[1:06:03] also testifying
[1:06:05] yes this this is a son
[1:06:07] yes you are overcomer yes he victorious
[1:06:09] oh come on now
[1:06:11] so so when that spirit in you begin to
[1:06:13] cry out
[1:06:15] and you also crying out that is service
[1:06:18] confirmation that makes you walk with
[1:06:19] even more confident somebody say amen
[1:06:26] the spirit itself bearing witness with
[1:06:29] our spirit that we are children of god
[1:06:31] and if children
[1:06:33] then is
[1:06:35] heirs of god
[1:06:37] and joint heirs with christ
[1:06:40] if so be that we suffer with him that we
[1:06:43] may all be also glorified together
[1:06:46] let's read that one more time
[1:06:49] if children then is so heirs mean you
[1:06:52] have an inheritance
[1:06:54] heirs of god joined heirs with christ
[1:06:56] which means you're sharing the
[1:06:58] inheritance with christ
[1:07:00] but there's a condition
[1:07:02] to this
[1:07:03] if so be that we suffer with him
[1:07:07] is is anybody willing to suffer
[1:07:13] sharing in his suffering
[1:07:15] that we could also reign
[1:07:17] that you're not looking at the are the
[1:07:19] suffering as a problem you're not afraid
[1:07:22] when things go wrong you're not afraid
[1:07:25] to be any reproach of the word you're
[1:07:26] not bothered with issues in your life
[1:07:29] when things happen because all this is
[1:07:31] part of it because you know you have an
[1:07:33] inheritance that you'll be also
[1:07:35] glorified and your suffering entitles
[1:07:38] you to glorification if so be that he's
[1:07:41] suffering with him that so that that
[1:07:43] says
[1:07:44] after his suffering or because of his
[1:07:46] suffering it opens even though that we
[1:07:49] may
[1:07:50] also be also glorified together
[1:07:54] verse
[1:07:55] for i reckon
[1:07:57] i love this
[1:07:59] i reckon
[1:08:00] in the amplified for i consider
[1:08:03] from the standpoint of fate
[1:08:06] that the sufferings of this present time
[1:08:10] and if this scripture was ever relevant
[1:08:12] yesterday
[1:08:13] i reckon that the sufferings of this
[1:08:16] present time
[1:08:17] 2020 2021 2022
[1:08:21] are not worthy to be compared
[1:08:24] with the glory which shall be revealed
[1:08:28] in us
[1:08:29] now this alone is a reason to shout
[1:08:32] because it's like a glory being revealed
[1:08:35] it's almost like i want you to see like
[1:08:36] a gift wrapped up
[1:08:38] and the gift paper coming off
[1:08:40] and you didn't know what was inside of
[1:08:42] you oh come on now so there's a
[1:08:44] revelation about a glory that's in you
[1:08:48] that only
[1:08:52] the suffering will highlight the glory
[1:08:57] because the glory is being compared to
[1:08:59] the suffering oh oh my hold on hold on
[1:09:02] let me let me slow down after
[1:09:04] for i reckon that his sufferings of this
[1:09:07] present time are not worthy to be
[1:09:09] compared
[1:09:10] with the glory so paul is comparing the
[1:09:14] sufferings and the issues and the
[1:09:16] challenges he said when awaits
[1:09:19] when away the sufferings
[1:09:22] and away with the revealing of the glory
[1:09:25] because to reveal something means it was
[1:09:28] hidden
[1:09:29] to reveal something means it was there
[1:09:31] and it was not known that it was there
[1:09:34] so there's a glory that god has to
[1:09:36] reveal
[1:09:38] in you
[1:09:39] it is not outside of you it's in you oh
[1:09:42] come on now
[1:09:44] anybody feeling to shout a little bit
[1:09:49] [Music]
[1:09:52] verse let's go on verse 19
[1:09:57] for the earnest expectation of the
[1:09:59] creature
[1:10:00] waited for the manifestation of the sons
[1:10:03] of god we know this in this one roman
[1:10:05] state his promise is the world is the
[1:10:07] world scroll here you know adoption
[1:10:10] manifestation spirit the old law calvary
[1:10:14] everything is locked up in this one
[1:10:15] personal for the earnest expectation
[1:10:19] of the creature
[1:10:20] for the evil in the amplified even the
[1:10:22] whole creation all nature waits eagerly
[1:10:25] listen for the amplified for the
[1:10:27] children of god to be revealed
[1:10:31] in other words it's as if there's
[1:10:32] there's a masking that's taking place
[1:10:35] people in all these are not dealing with
[1:10:37] outside the bride dealing with churches
[1:10:39] are they dealing with people who in this
[1:10:41] room there's a revelation happening
[1:10:43] there's a revealing happening there's an
[1:10:45] uncovering happening there's an
[1:10:47] unveiling people come into church and
[1:10:49] there's three kinds of believers but it
[1:10:51] will come a period a time of revealing
[1:10:54] and that is what the earnest expectation
[1:10:57] of the creature waiting for the
[1:11:00] manifestation or the revealing the
[1:11:02] uncovering the unfolding the pulling
[1:11:05] back the veil of who you really are that
[1:11:08] god dropped you in 2022 to be an adopted
[1:11:12] son
[1:11:13] to be a positionally played son and the
[1:11:15] devil doesn't know it the person next to
[1:11:17] you in church don't even know who you
[1:11:19] are oh come on now you don't hear me
[1:11:21] tonight
[1:11:23] there are some hidden ones here tonight
[1:11:26] whatever i'm saying third person with
[1:11:28] the weaker ones but eventually when they
[1:11:29] get over there you're gonna see people
[1:11:31] who you you couldn't believe they make
[1:11:33] it oh come on now all of this part of
[1:11:35] the revealing that the whole creation
[1:11:37] waiting on to reveal those who look like
[1:11:40] they don't have a chance that they can
[1:11:42] make it to reveal those who drag
[1:11:44] themselves to bible study there wasn't
[1:11:46] really any feeling this evening but it
[1:11:48] dragged itself to connect the night all
[1:11:50] of that is being revealed because that
[1:11:53] you revealing yourself it's god has to
[1:11:55] do the revealing because he is the
[1:11:57] interpreter of his own word
[1:11:59] oh you don't hear me tonight
[1:12:04] for the creature
[1:12:06] verse 20 was made subject of vanity
[1:12:10] not willingly
[1:12:14] but by reason of him who had subjected
[1:12:17] the same in hope
[1:12:20] listen
[1:12:21] four listen to what this means friends
[1:12:24] for the creation
[1:12:26] was subjected to frustration and
[1:12:29] futility
[1:12:32] not willingly
[1:12:34] because of some intentional fault of its
[1:12:36] part
[1:12:37] in other words god is saying everything
[1:12:40] we're going through
[1:12:41] the frustration
[1:12:43] the futility things are looking like it
[1:12:45] working on behalf of nature everything
[1:12:49] not because of an intentional thought on
[1:12:52] its path adam didn't set out to sin
[1:12:54] adam didn't set out to fall adam didn't
[1:12:57] plan to sin adam didn't plan to fall
[1:13:00] but by the will of him who subjected it
[1:13:03] in hope
[1:13:05] that the creation will also be freed
[1:13:07] from its bondage so your frustration
[1:13:11] is not by your design oh let me let me
[1:13:14] say that again
[1:13:16] your frustration is not your fault
[1:13:20] but god
[1:13:22] allowed all these things to bring
[1:13:24] certain things up because the creator
[1:13:26] itself shall be delivered
[1:13:29] from the bondage of corruption the
[1:13:31] corruption of sin the corruption of
[1:13:33] death into the glorious liberty of the
[1:13:37] sons of god verse 22 for we know
[1:13:42] that the whole creation
[1:13:44] groan it and travail it in pain together
[1:13:48] until now
[1:13:50] and not only they but ourselves also
[1:13:54] which have the first fruits of the
[1:13:56] spirit
[1:13:57] even we ourselves grown within ourselves
[1:14:01] waiting for the adoption to with the
[1:14:04] redemption of our body
[1:14:08] for we are saved by hope
[1:14:11] but hope
[1:14:12] that is seen is not hope
[1:14:14] i want to
[1:14:15] pause there for we are saved by hope
[1:14:19] but hope that is seen
[1:14:22] is not hope
[1:14:23] i want to read that one more time for we
[1:14:25] are saved by hope
[1:14:27] but hope that is seen
[1:14:30] is not hope
[1:14:33] for who hopes for what he already sees
[1:14:36] doesn't need any amplified in other
[1:14:38] words
[1:14:39] we are saved by hope but the hope that
[1:14:40] is seen is not really hope
[1:14:42] for what a man see it why what he had
[1:14:45] hoped for
[1:14:47] but if we hope
[1:14:48] for that we see not
[1:14:50] then do we with patients wait for it so
[1:14:53] our hope is in what we do not see
[1:14:56] and that speaks to your fate as a
[1:14:57] believer
[1:14:59] knowing your change is coming knowing
[1:15:01] your promise is about to happen knowing
[1:15:04] your children will be delivered knowing
[1:15:06] you're going to get the holy ghost
[1:15:07] knowing you're going to make it knowing
[1:15:10] it's locked up inside of you to be
[1:15:12] revealed knowing that the sufferings of
[1:15:14] this present time is all about revealing
[1:15:17] the glory in you and you have a hope and
[1:15:20] expectation something wake it up this
[1:15:22] morning it will awaken by the grace of
[1:15:24] god tomorrow it will wake you up by the
[1:15:26] grace of god the next day it's a hope we
[1:15:28] have a hope that this body can be
[1:15:30] changed we have a hope that is grey here
[1:15:32] the bald head could be changed we have a
[1:15:34] hope that he had the art rightists and
[1:15:36] the high blood pressure and the female
[1:15:38] condition and the financial problems and
[1:15:40] the marriage issues and the family
[1:15:43] issues we have a hope
[1:15:46] and it's not a hope if we could see it
[1:15:49] it looks like it might not happen but we
[1:15:51] have hope
[1:15:52] because hope we could see is not really
[1:15:54] hope but we have a hope in what we
[1:15:56] cannot see
[1:15:57] we don't see
[1:15:59] much but we have a hope
[1:16:02] like elijah telling yourself and go look
[1:16:05] go look he said i look i see nothing but
[1:16:08] it's because of hope he said go and look
[1:16:10] again oh come on somebody help me
[1:16:12] tonight
[1:16:13] he said go look again
[1:16:15] i have a hope that rain is going to come
[1:16:20] he didn't see anything he said go look
[1:16:22] again
[1:16:23] until you see i see a claw like a man's
[1:16:25] hand
[1:16:26] and then i just say listen don't walk
[1:16:29] don't walk he say run
[1:16:31] run and tell him i hear the sound of the
[1:16:34] abolition run and tell them the rain is
[1:16:37] coming anybody with me tonight
[1:16:48] he many many men
[1:16:52] verse 26
[1:16:53] likewise
[1:16:55] the spirit verse 26 also helpeth our
[1:17:00] infirmities
[1:17:02] for we know not what we should pray for
[1:17:05] as we ought
[1:17:08] but the spirit itself
[1:17:11] make it intercession for us with
[1:17:13] groanings which cannot be uttered
[1:17:18] listen to this in the amplified
[1:17:21] in the same way
[1:17:22] the spirit comes to us
[1:17:25] and helps us in our weakness
[1:17:27] we do not know what prayer to offer
[1:17:30] or how to offer it as we should
[1:17:33] but the spirit himself
[1:17:35] knows our need and at the right time
[1:17:38] intercedes on our behalf
[1:17:41] with sighs and groanings too deep for
[1:17:43] words oh my
[1:17:46] you know sometimes they come to a prayer
[1:17:47] meeting and you don't even know what to
[1:17:49] pray for
[1:17:51] you don't even know what to ask for
[1:17:53] but you're so up to prominent and you
[1:17:55] know you have a need you have a desire
[1:17:56] you can't put into word paul is
[1:17:59] addressing it here in the same way you
[1:18:01] bring in a type likewise his spirit
[1:18:04] also help it
[1:18:06] when we weak
[1:18:07] when we tired when we have no strength
[1:18:10] when we barely hold it on
[1:18:13] when we don't know what to pray for
[1:18:15] as we ought
[1:18:16] but the spirit itself
[1:18:18] make intercession for us
[1:18:20] with groanings which cannot be uttered
[1:18:23] we don't have the words we don't know
[1:18:25] what to ask for they say lord just help
[1:18:27] me
[1:18:28] lord i have a need i can't put it into
[1:18:30] words i don't know how to ask i don't
[1:18:33] know how to articulate it i don't know
[1:18:35] how to express it i don't know how to
[1:18:37] describe it i just know i have a need
[1:18:39] i'm not sure what the problem is i don't
[1:18:41] know how to pray is there anybody
[1:18:43] tonight
[1:18:44] look how much stuff locked up in his
[1:18:46] romans 8.
[1:18:50] and verse 27 and he that searched the
[1:18:52] hearts know it what is the mind of the
[1:18:56] spirit
[1:18:57] because he make it intercession for the
[1:19:00] saints according to the will of god
[1:19:05] hallelujah and that is what opens the
[1:19:07] door to our scripture and our title for
[1:19:10] tonight's teaching
[1:19:11] and we know
[1:19:13] and this we know is not in isolation it
[1:19:16] is in the context of everything that was
[1:19:18] said before
[1:19:20] because paul is now building feet
[1:19:22] he is taking them from being under the
[1:19:25] law of sin a debt to an understanding of
[1:19:28] the law of the spirit of life that
[1:19:30] understanding of because of what christ
[1:19:32] did and because of what his spirit could
[1:19:35] do and if you walk in his spirit what
[1:19:37] will happen and that is suffering that
[1:19:39] you will go through will never be too
[1:19:41] much that you could bear and on top of
[1:19:43] all of that when you can't pray and you
[1:19:45] don't know how to pray oh god he gonna
[1:19:47] give your words and his spirit himself
[1:19:50] will intercede for you and on top of
[1:19:52] that four we know that all things
[1:19:56] work together for good
[1:19:58] to them that love god
[1:20:00] to them who are the called according to
[1:20:03] his purpose
[1:20:04] so paul is saying well if you didn't
[1:20:06] know before
[1:20:07] now you know that if you're called
[1:20:10] according to his purpose if you love god
[1:20:13] then all things will work together do
[1:20:15] you believe that tonight that all things
[1:20:18] god does all things well there's no
[1:20:20] accident there's no mistake there's no
[1:20:23] situation there's no trouble there's no
[1:20:26] challenge there's no trial can somebody
[1:20:28] say hallelujah tonight could somebody
[1:20:30] say yes lord somebody say thank you
[1:20:33] jesus tonight
[1:20:35] all things
[1:20:36] all things not something all things no
[1:20:40] accident you're here tonight not by
[1:20:42] accident you're here tonight not by
[1:20:44] chance what is happening in your life
[1:20:47] all is well
[1:20:49] all is well
[1:20:51] all is well god is not surprised brother
[1:20:54] ovid said it on sunday nobody could pull
[1:20:57] the world over
[1:20:59] nobody's surprising god god is not
[1:21:02] surprised tonight god is not worried
[1:21:04] tonight god not stressed out thinking
[1:21:06] about how to solve your problem he has
[1:21:09] already solved your problem you have to
[1:21:11] walk in his solution tonight the spirit
[1:21:14] has already made a way god is not now
[1:21:18] figuring it out he's not trying to work
[1:21:20] it out he's not doing no mathematics he
[1:21:22] has already done it it's our finished
[1:21:25] work oh you don't you don't have i feel
[1:21:27] like preaching this is bible study but i
[1:21:30] feel like preaching tonight because all
[1:21:32] things work together for good at the
[1:21:34] equal sign it's good when you have no
[1:21:36] money it's good when you're trying to
[1:21:38] it's good because god knows how to do it
[1:21:44] hallelujah
[1:21:46] i'm trying to close out
[1:21:50] and paul billington supporting them in
[1:21:53] this this year is i i don't know how
[1:21:55] paul was feeling when he was writing
[1:21:57] this letter but i don't think paul said
[1:22:00] and his righteous oh just so because
[1:22:02] that's so much fire i think paul was
[1:22:03] jumping paul was moving paul had to put
[1:22:06] his pen down pull out the razzy hands up
[1:22:08] if your car put this top in one letter
[1:22:12] and sit down go this is not a no this is
[1:22:14] not you writing somebody
[1:22:16] this is life you're talking about here
[1:22:18] you know or you don't hear me tonight
[1:22:20] and on top of that paul is billing he is
[1:22:23] building on it he said for whom he did
[1:22:27] for no
[1:22:28] he said if god know you
[1:22:31] once god know here before
[1:22:33] god and now meeting you tonight if he
[1:22:36] didn't foreknow you he also did
[1:22:38] predestinate
[1:22:40] not to be a church member not to be in
[1:22:42] the message not to come to the message
[1:22:45] he also did predestinate to be conformed
[1:22:49] to the image of his son not by the law
[1:22:52] of sin and death not by rules and
[1:22:54] regulation but the conforming
[1:22:56] the image of his son could only be by
[1:22:58] the spirit that he
[1:23:01] might be the firstborn among many
[1:23:03] brethren so god by design
[1:23:06] by the spirit had christ jesus to be the
[1:23:09] firstborn among many brethren knowing
[1:23:12] fully well that there will be many
[1:23:14] brethren like who in this room tonight
[1:23:16] that could be counted as joint ears
[1:23:19] oh i don't know what kind of i would say
[1:23:20] this is tonight
[1:23:22] but if we could charge a pulpit you
[1:23:24] could touch a pulpit if you want to jump
[1:23:26] and shout you can jump and shout but
[1:23:28] this is reality
[1:23:29] this is the best way to spend a tuesday
[1:23:31] evening you know without no better way
[1:23:33] to spend a tuesday evening
[1:23:37] whom he did for know he also did
[1:23:39] predestinate to be conformed to the
[1:23:41] image of his son that he might be the
[1:23:44] firstborn among many brethren moreover
[1:23:48] moreover means on top of it
[1:23:50] if i want to build further i want to i
[1:23:52] want to hype it up more more over in
[1:23:55] other words it have more to it god is
[1:23:57] not dividing and subtracting he is
[1:24:00] adding and multiplying he wants your
[1:24:02] fear to be high he wants your confidence
[1:24:05] to be high he wants your joy to be high
[1:24:08] you want your expectation to be high he
[1:24:11] wants your hope to be high so moreover
[1:24:14] whom he did predestinate them he also
[1:24:17] called
[1:24:19] he called it a night not a bible study
[1:24:21] that can recall
[1:24:23] that's what he called this is part of
[1:24:25] you recognizing what you call for and
[1:24:27] whom he called them he also justified
[1:24:30] past tense not will justify
[1:24:33] god write it paul i tell you paul could
[1:24:35] not be writing this just so he said also
[1:24:38] justified he had a revelation of finnish
[1:24:41] work
[1:24:42] justified already happened when god
[1:24:45] looked at you justified and whom he
[1:24:47] justified them you also glorified past
[1:24:49] tense so when god looked at you he's
[1:24:51] seen you adopted in him
[1:24:53] he's seen you perfected you know he's
[1:24:56] seen seven living voices you know he's
[1:24:58] seen the thunder that's shaking the
[1:24:59] devil or no it's in seed form but he's
[1:25:02] looking at what you are because he is
[1:25:04] eternal we trapped in time where he is
[1:25:08] everything is done already you know
[1:25:11] oh my
[1:25:12] verse 31 we almost done
[1:25:15] what shall we then say in other words
[1:25:17] after all of that long what issue you
[1:25:19] could bring tonight what problem you
[1:25:22] could bring tonight that gorka handled
[1:25:24] he said what shall we then say to these
[1:25:27] things
[1:25:29] if god before us
[1:25:31] in 2022 as we open bible study in 2022
[1:25:36] if god be for us who can be against us
[1:25:40] he that spared not his own son
[1:25:43] because he considered this thing too
[1:25:45] important
[1:25:47] to not pay whatever price was required
[1:25:49] to reach a solution he that spared not
[1:25:52] his own son he that not only understood
[1:25:56] the cost of sacrifice he that spared not
[1:25:59] his own son but delivered him up for us
[1:26:02] all in other words he was willing to
[1:26:04] give his best his best thing he could do

[1:26:50] realm of this thing and he reckons how
[1:26:51] petty problems are because some people
[1:26:53] any problem the problem seems like
[1:26:54] everything else but when they step

[1:27:04] knocking out you know that's why the
[1:27:05] bible said they'd say is this the man
[1:27:07] who caused nation to tremble
[1:27:09] because it reframed a perspective that
[1:27:12] this devil has no power
[1:27:16] i'm trying to close out
[1:27:18] the chapter has an end so we'll we'll
[1:27:20] we'll we'll reach our end
[1:27:24] how sadly not him also freely give us

[1:27:46] devil can't even come unless god allow
[1:27:48] him to come like job this is god's elect

[1:28:04] just
[1:28:05] my um

[1:28:11] justifies us declaring us blameless and
[1:28:15] putting us
[1:28:16] in a right relationship with himself in
[1:28:19] other words
[1:28:21] it's not even you putting yourself in a
[1:28:23] right relationship god is the one who
[1:28:26] put in you in a right relationship
[1:28:28] that's why he said who can lay a charge
[1:28:31] who could bring the accusation he said i
[1:28:33] have this one covered i don't take care
[1:28:35] about a purple i don't take care but for

[1:28:47] what nobody says it is god that
[1:28:49] justified who is he that condemn it
[1:28:53] it is christ that died ye rather is

[1:29:46] for the slaughter nay in all these
[1:29:49] things we are more than conquerors

[1:29:56] strength not through your strength not

[1:31:19] level of focus
[1:31:20] and positive energy knowing in whom you
[1:31:23] have believed and in what you have
[1:31:26] received and of faith and confidence in

[1:32:01] to find it because he put that glory in
[1:32:03] you he put that seed in you before the
[1:32:06] foundation of the world that's why we
[1:32:08] can declare tonight we are not even the
[1:32:10] believers but the word in us
