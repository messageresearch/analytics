[33:11] chapter 29 when we some places here we
[33:15] didn't from Luke chapter 11 verse 5 he
[33:17] said unto them which of you have a
[33:19] friend and shall go under him at
[33:21] midnight and see him friend let me tree
[33:24] loose for a friend of mine and in his

[33:37] unto you
[33:38] though he will not rise and give him
[33:41] because he's his friend yet because of
[33:44] his importunity
[33:46] which is his persistence he will rise
[33:48] and give him as many as he needed and I
[33:51] say unto you ask it shall be given you
[33:54] seek you shall find knock it shall be
[33:56] opened unto you
[33:57] for every one that asketh
[33:59] see it he that seeketh findeth and to
[34:01] him that knocketh it shall be opened if
[34:04] a son shall ask bread of any of you that
[34:07] is a father and will you give him a
[34:08] stone or if he ask a fish will you will
[34:13] he for a fish give him a serpent or if
[34:15] he shall ask an egg really offer my
[34:18] scorpion if ye then being evil know how
[34:23] to give good gifts unto your children
[34:25] how much more shall your heavenly Father
[34:29] give the Holy Spirit to them that ask
[34:31] him and we didn't Jeremiah chapter 29
[34:36] when we verse 1 demigod of his for now
[34:39] these are the words of the letter the
[34:41] Jeremiah the Prophet sent from Jerusalem
[34:44] under the residue of the elders which
[34:47] were carried away captures unto the
[34:50] priests and to the prophets and to all
[34:52] the people whom Nebuchadnezzar had
[34:53] carried away captive from Jerusalem to
[34:56] Babylon this for thus saith the Lord of
[35:00] hosts the God of Israel unto all that a
[35:05] carrot or a captive whom I have caused
[35:09] to be carried away from Jerusalem and to
[35:13] Babylon Billy houses and dwell in them
[35:18] and plant gardens and eat the fruit of
[35:22] them taking wives and beget sons and
[35:27] daughters and take wives for your sons
[35:31] and give your daughters the husbands
[35:34] that they may be as sons and daughters
[35:38] that he may be increased there and not
[35:42] diminished and seek the peace of the
[35:46] city whether I have caused you to be
[35:49] carried away captive and pray unto the
[35:53] Lord for it for in the Peace thereof
[35:56] shall ye have peace for d'Or saith the
[36:01] Lord of hosts the God of Israel let not
[36:05] your prophets and your diviners
[36:07] that be in the midst of you
[36:10] deceive you need a Hearton to your
[36:12] dreams which he caused to be dreamed for
[36:16] the prophesy falsely unto you in my name
[36:20] I have not sent them seer the Lord for
[36:25] thus saith the Lord that after seventy
[36:28] years be accomplished at Babylon I will
[36:31] visit you and perform my good word
[36:34] towards you in causing you to return to
[36:38] this place for I know the torch that I
[36:41] think to what you see at the Lord
[36:44] thoughts of peace and not of evil to
[36:47] give you an expected end then shall ye
[36:52] call upon me and he shall go on three
[36:55] unto me and I will happen unto you and
[36:59] you shall seek me and find me when you
[37:04] shall search for me with all your heart
[37:09] and I will be fond of you saith the Lord
[37:12] and I will turn away your captivity may
[37:17] God bless his word you may be seated
[37:22] tonight just a little thought search for
[37:26] me but all your heart are we no Romans
[37:31] 8:28 for we know all things work
[37:34] together for good to them that love God
[37:37] to them who are the called according to
[37:41] his purpose and not love God is not like
[37:45] church like church but at love God is
[37:50] scripturally loving God and and in sin
[37:54] John 14:23 jesus answered and said unto
[37:57] them if a man love me he will keep my
[38:00] words and my father would love him some
[38:03] people like the anointing they like the
[38:05] singing the light is special they like
[38:07] their music but we're talking about
[38:09] loving God if a man love me he will keep
[38:12] my words and my father will love him
[38:15] and we will come on to him and make our
[38:18] board with him he that loveth me not
[38:21] keep it up my sins the word which you
[38:24] hear is not mine but the father which
[38:27] sent me so praise the Lord so what a
[38:32] time we are in now in this season and
[38:36] it's very interesting that we could
[38:39] speak and there's not a congregation
[38:40] here just about what five six brothers
[38:42] here and so I can see faces so I could
[38:48] speak but I want to just bring something
[38:53] to you and the Prophet saying here he
[39:01] was saying for messages second comment
[39:05] he said then another thing I believe
[39:06] that when Satan which was prophesied
[39:09] would go about like a roaring lion in
[39:12] the last days to destroy mortal life and
[39:17] spiritual eyes and everything that he
[39:20] could and I believe then if all the
[39:24] dumpings of all the evil is being dumped
[39:29] out on the human race in beasty
[39:31] I believe that all the blessings will be
[39:35] dumped out or poor old rasa or heavenly
[39:39] father upon the church in the last days
[39:41] so Satan can have a one upon us when the
[39:45] enemy come in like a flood the Spirit
[39:48] will raise a standard and then he said
[39:51] this is praying a prayer from God talked
[39:54] to Moses he said our dear precious Lord
[39:56] we are so unworthy to come to you and
[39:59] yet there has been so loving to us to
[40:02] promise us that if we would ask anything
[40:04] you would do it and that's the
[40:06] confidence that we come in tonight
[40:09] confessing of our sins and the sins of
[40:12] this nation the sins of the city that we
[40:16] are speaking of God be merciful and
[40:19] think of those poor little children
[40:21] fallen with that horrible demon of polio
[40:23] that was in that time and now we know
[40:26] that dokkan and
[40:28] move dis ting and I pray God that
[40:31] there'll be an old-fashioned meetin
[40:33] started here are permitting all along
[40:36] the city made the church's fall on their
[40:39] faces I believe you would stop the
[40:44] plague Lord we know I made a many angel
[41:27] of God stand over the city and we know
[41:30] that the demons will scatter when he
[41:33] stands and see him granted father we
[41:36] pray you will do this and we do it for
[41:44] the kingdom of the powerful prayer and
[41:50] when Jeremiah send this letter this wood
[41:55] from the Lord God have to tell them get
[41:59] married have children because God knew
[42:06] there was so much time that was left
[42:09] and God said forget all them diviners
[42:13] and prophets the dreamers
[42:16] design for sleep and he told them that
[42:20] after 70 years in Babylon I will visit
[42:23] you he expressed them about his thoughts
[42:28] I know my thoughts I think towards you
[42:30] my thoughts thoughts of peace and not
[42:32] evil to give an expected end but then
[42:36] this is the path we want to get through
[42:37] then shall you call upon me and he shall
[42:42] go and pray unto me and I will and you
[42:47] shall seek me and find me when you shall
[42:51] search for me was after God is now and
[43:01] Jesus give this parable about a man who
[43:05] wanted bread who had guests and he was
[43:08] coming to a friend and the friend would
[43:12] not give because of friendship but he
[43:16] will get up because of his importunity
[43:18] and give him as much as he needed so he
[43:22] was expressing the persistence
[43:30] I've got the strength the power I've got
[43:34] to have what your promise in this hour
[43:36] that persistence that aggression that is
[43:41] the attitude that he wanted and then
[43:43] Jesus went on and says something further
[43:45] he said Aska shall be given them and
[43:47] seek and you shall find and not open so
[43:50] even though somebody could say I'm not I
[43:52] thought I asked then he went on further
[43:55] and said for every one that asketh
[43:58] receiveth he that seeketh findeth to him
[44:01] that knocketh it shall be opened so it's
[44:03] not a one knock another one cheek
[44:05] another one else is escaped as he kept
[44:09] is not kept more glory to God then he
[44:13] went on to say if you being evil nor
[44:15] they give good gifts on
[44:16] children how much more shall your
[44:18] heavenly Father give the Holy Spirit to
[44:20] them that ask him
[44:22] Oh glory don't go to the Holy Spirit you
[44:24] have two acts Fiat is cemented acts for
[44:27] and that's the seal of God and that's
[44:29] the mass of the Holy Ghost just two just
[44:32] two mats in the last days the mark of
[44:34] the beast and the seed of the Living God
[44:36] Oh hallelujah praise be to Jesus do you
[44:40] love him tonight
[44:40] Oh blessed be the name of the Lord
[44:43] nineteen I believe it was 56 the Prophet
[44:48] gave a vision and he saw the vision and
[44:51] he saw the holy spirit moving a light
[44:54] move away from me and went down into a
[44:56] little building and there was something
[44:58] different between the light and the
[44:59] angel cause he was still with me and the
[45:02] light went into the building and the
[45:04] angel which was a big man said I will
[45:06] meet you in dear
[45:07] and then I said I don't understand why
[45:10] India he said watch and this woman when
[45:13] she come on on the humble on stretcher
[45:16] she was pushing the stretcher on the
[45:17] other side and the lady asked her what
[45:20] happened she said I don't know I've been
[45:22] in this stretcher for in bed for years
[45:24] and here come the man out packing his
[45:27] crutches they asked him he didn't know
[45:29] and he come out to the platform to
[45:31] testify and I said I don't understand
[45:34] what's in there so when they pass
[45:36] through this tent they was sick on this
[45:38] side and a heel on this side crippled on
[45:40] this side and they walkin on this side
[45:42] whatever the condition they coming right
[45:44] through is not right and I said I don't
[45:46] understand that India that meet you
[45:50] India and what he is always scriptural
[45:54] he said did not our Lord see when the
[45:58] prayers be not like the hypocrites for
[46:00] they like to make a show
[46:02] he said enter into the secret closet and
[46:05] when you have done so closed the door
[46:08] then pray to your father which seeth in
[46:12] secret and he that sees in secret shall
[46:15] reward you openly
[46:18] under the Seventh Seal is the last coat
[46:20] on the seventh seal you will see in a
[46:24] voice that you can't teach Pentecostal
[46:26] baby supernatural things
[46:28] leave them alone then he picked me up he
[46:32] took me up set me up way high - we're
[46:35] meeting was going on look like a tent or
[46:37] a cathedral or some sort and a little
[46:39] box a little place over to the side and
[46:42] I see the light was talking to somebody
[46:44] above me that light that you see on the
[46:46] picture it whirled away from me like
[46:49] that and went over that tent and said I
[46:52] will meet you in there and said this is
[46:54] the temple and you won't tell it to
[46:57] nobody now now that you're home what are
[47:04] you going to do with your time know that
[47:09] you're home you sit in you're watching
[47:12] over time a prayer there's no deacon
[47:14] there is no pasta
[47:15] there is no elder there's nobody
[47:17] watching and coming to church in other
[47:19] words there is no accountability to come
[47:23] to anyone you're on your own what are
[47:27] you gonna do with the time this is tea

[47:36] outside

[47:40] potential carrier treat like everyone is
[47:44] a trend so your watch where you go you
[47:47] watch what you do you watch what you

[47:59] sports all who must go to affect or to
[48:04] advance or to a club or must go and
[48:06] fellowship with some friends you can't
[48:09] do that now because something else is
[48:12] moving now here's the challenge what are

[48:44] to come by the people in your home in
[48:48] your life no revival isn't adding new
[48:53] members to the church its reviving what
