[19:59] the book of Revelation tonight how many
[20:01] appreciate the Sunday service but I
[20:04] praise God tremendous blessing by Norris
[20:06] Cummins
[20:07] and I had a tank a many many name was
[20:11] just what the doctor ordered
[20:15] it was such a blessing than them and you
[20:18] know what are so great I didn't have to
[20:21] ask doctrine teacher nothing I just we
[20:25] just connect in the spirit invite him
[20:27] and a shocker of shockers I actually had
[20:31] to invite him on my behalf I was flying
[20:33] out and flying in the water so I really
[20:35] didn't get to speak to him on only
[20:36] before he talked to me in the office or
[20:39] water so can you imagine that either I'm
[20:42] crazy or have some kind of discernment
[20:44] but God is not dead he's alive and he is
[20:49] caught tonight proven that we could have
[20:52] fellowship and that has none do it
[20:54] doctrine we could still reach arms of
[20:56] love and feet and grease we don't have
[21:00] all the gifts and God have gifts oh dear
[21:01] he's gonna use for his honor and his
[21:04] glory and every gift good to find its
[21:07] place that's right it's God's gift God
[21:10] good evil Nick away for itself and every
[21:12] gift of God if I miss please so my job
[21:15] was to make sure your heart is not
[21:17] corrupted towards any minister or church
[21:20] or anybody so anybody could come here
[21:22] and minister the word and you'll be
[21:24] blessed and then what somebody funny I
[21:27] and whatnot that is my responsibility
[21:29] here to keep the church clean that
[21:32] you're gonna have your right attitude to
[21:33] any servant of God I would come here
[21:35] like any man come here could only preach
[21:37] Mike a measure that God give him I think
[21:39] what we preach tonight my the message
[21:41] that God gave me I don't have somebody
[21:43] as measure gordium illness and that's
[21:45] the mention that I have to preach with
[21:47] so let's read from revelation chapter 2
[21:49] verse 1 to 7 under the Angel of the
[21:51] Church of Ephesus
[21:52] write these things saith he that holdeth
[21:55] the seven stars in his right hand who
[21:57] walketh in the midst of the seven golden
[21:59] candlesticks I know thy works by labor
[22:02] my patience how that canst not bear them
[22:04] which are evil that was tried in which
[22:06] see there are puzzles and are not strong
[22:09] them liars and has borne as patience for
[22:12] my name's sake hast laboured has not
[22:14] fainted nevertheless I have somewhat
[22:17] against thee because there was the left
[22:18] I first love remember therefore from
[22:20] whence thou art fallen and repent and do
[22:23] the first works or else I was common to
[22:25] be quickly I will remove thy candlestick
[22:26] out of his place except thou repent but
[22:30] this Doh hosta thou hatest the deeds of
[22:32] the Nicolaitans which I also eat he'd
[22:35] have had an ear let him hear what the
[22:36] spirit saith unto the churches
[22:38] to him that overcometh will I give to
[22:40] eat of the tree of life in the midst of
[22:43] the paradise of God
[22:45] revelation chapter three from verse 14
[22:48] so he go from Ephesus how he go street
[22:51] up to under the agent of the Church of
[22:53] loud visions write these things saith
[22:56] the Amen the faithful and true witness
[22:58] the beginning of the creation of God I
[23:00] know thy works that thou art neither
[23:02] cold nor hot I would that I would call
[23:05] her heart so then because thou art
[23:06] lukewarm and neither cold nor hot I will
[23:09] spew thee out of my mouth because
[23:12] dossiers are rich and increased with
[23:13] Goods have need of nothing knowest not
[23:16] that thou art wretched miserable poor
[23:18] blind and naked I constantly to buy of
[23:22] me gold tried in the fire that always
[23:24] may be rich and white raiment that
[23:26] always be clothed and that the shame of
[23:28] thy nakedness do not appear and anoint
[23:31] and I but I saw that all may I see as
[23:34] many as I love I rebuke and chasten be
[23:37] zealous therefore and repent behold I
[23:39] stand at the door knock If any man hear
[23:41] my voice and open the door I will come
[23:44] into him
[23:44] I will sup with him and he with me they
[23:47] not overcometh will I grant to sit with
[23:49] me in my throne even as I also overcame
[23:51] and I'm sat down with my father in his
[23:54] throne he that hath an ear let him hear
[23:57] what the spirit saith unto the churches
[23:58] may God bless his word it may be seated

[1:09:03] you must realize the Spirit is not
[1:09:05] speaking to the original scenes of FSS
[1:09:07] alone the message is the entire age it's
[1:09:10] a message then to all generations in
[1:09:12] that span now history keep repeating
[1:09:14] repeating itself
[1:09:15] in generations of Israel we should be
[1:09:18] viable in one generation only you see
[1:09:19] the fires fading in the next and the two
[1:09:22] generation embers may be glowing
[1:09:23] slightly in the fourth there will no
[1:09:25] vestige whatsoever of the original flame
[1:09:27] then going to testify again and the same
[1:09:30] process is repeated it's simply the
[1:09:32] manifestation of the truth that God has
[1:09:34] no grandchildren
[1:09:36] salvation is not passed on by natural
[1:09:38] birth anymore is any truth apostolic
[1:09:41] succession it isn't in the word you
[1:09:43] start out with truly born again
[1:09:45] believers then the next generation come
[1:09:47] along they are no longer just plain
[1:09:48] Christians but they have taken on a name
[1:09:50] Baptists and Methodists that's exactly
[1:09:53] what they are they are not Christians

[1:10:02] Methodist as human but when caught you
[1:10:05] must be born again when you are billeted
[1:10:08] from above that despite the will of God

[1:16:15] the lump is also holy is the root before
[1:16:17] he saw the branches here we go if some
[1:16:20] of the branches be broken off that Dow
[1:16:23] sticking about us Gentiles being a wild
[1:16:25] olive tree were grafted in among them
[1:16:27] and with them partakers of the root and
[1:16:29] the factors of the olive tree boast not
[1:16:31] against the branches but if thou boast
[1:16:34] our bear is not the root but the root D
[1:16:35] if don't we'll see the branches were
[1:16:38] broken off that I might be grafted in
[1:16:40] well here we go hit the pattern on a
[1:16:42] striking because of unbelief they were
[1:16:46] broken off and thou standest my feet be
[1:16:50] not high-minded but fear for if God
[1:16:53] spared not the natural branches take
[1:16:56] heed mrs. Kennedy behold the goodness
[1:17:01] and the severity of God on them which

[1:17:23] watch and also if they are bite not
[1:17:26] still and unbelief okay let me back up a
[1:17:28] bit but there was the goodness in the
[1:17:30] continuous goodness otherwise thou shalt
[1:17:32] also be cut off and if they also if they
[1:17:35] are bite not still and underneath one
[1:17:37] shall be grafted in for God is able to
[1:17:39] if they abide not still in unbelief
[1:17:40] shall be graffed it in four cords able
[1:17:43] to graft them in again and we know God
[1:17:45] will do that so God will take off the
[1:17:47] Gentile and cut them off and stick back
[1:17:49] in the Jews and they are the natural
[1:17:51] branches so we are here by the feet on
[1:17:53] the musha's of God take a whole of it
[1:17:56] thank you for your mercy
[1:17:57] thank you for your fever thank you for
[1:17:59] your grace oh god I love you Oh
[1:18:02] and we're I'm saying what what cause
[1:18:04] that they get cut off because I rejected
[1:18:06] Pentecost Oh glory to God hallelujah
[1:18:09] and he said they rejected Pentecost and
[1:18:11] became one of the greatest nations
[1:18:13] become one of the lowest and was
[1:18:14] scattered because of unbelief Israel no
[1:18:18] they disbelieve the Pentecostal message
[1:18:21] that Paul was preaching God cut him off
[1:18:24] and took a wild olive branch which was a
[1:18:26] Gentile US and grafted us in that we
[1:18:29] might live off the substance of the tree
[1:18:31] here we go
[1:18:32] momentum evangelism according to Malachi
[1:18:34] 4 is to bring them back to the feet that
[1:18:38] was wasn't about the Saints are you
[1:18:40] ready bring them back to the fate of the
[1:18:42] father's the Pentecostal pact in the
[1:18:45] restoration time and we are about to
[1:18:48] approach the restoration tank but
[1:18:51] there's a Pentecostal pact in the
[1:18:53] restoration time I will restore see in
[1:18:55] the law book give the Lord a shout and
[1:18:58] the people in the message they're
[1:19:00] missing this part what part the
[1:19:02] Pentecostal part or they survived partly
[1:19:05] because that belongs to us we have to
[1:19:07] have justification sanctification
[1:19:09] Pentecostal pact in the world we can't
[1:19:12] pull up any course and say we have the
[1:19:14] word no that's your spirit to make the
[1:19:18] wood come alive or give the Lord a shout
[1:19:21] the Spirit is what gives strength and
[1:19:24] power to the world itself the word is a
[1:19:27] conductor of the Spirit
[1:19:28] the reason the prophet brought the word
