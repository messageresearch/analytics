[43:04] you said unto them wheresoever the body
[43:07] is

[43:11] together
[43:12] the last scripture from revelation
[43:14] chapter 10 reading from verse 8
[43:18] and the voice which i heard from heaven
[43:20] speaking to me again and said go
[43:22] and take the little book which is open
[43:25] in the hand of the angel
[43:27] which standed upon the sea and upon the
[43:29] earth and i went unto the angel and said
[43:31] unto him
[43:32] give me the little book he said unto me
[43:34] take it eat it up it shall make thy
[43:36] belly bitter
[43:37] but it shall be thy mouth sweet sweetest
[43:39] honey and i took the little book out of
[43:41] the angel's hand
[43:42] and ate it up and it was in my mouth
[43:44] sweetest honey
[43:46] and as soon as i had eaten it
[43:49] my belly was bitter and he said unto me
[43:51] dog must prophesy again
[43:54] before many peoples and nations and
[43:56] tongues and kings let's pray again
[43:58] father we thank you
[43:59] for this holy writ your word and any man
[44:02] could turn
[44:03] the bible and read scriptures but it
[44:05] take the holy spirit the
[44:07] revealer of the divine revelation
[44:09] revelation of god to the people
[44:11] to reveal it so may you come and reveal
[44:13] your word reveal the scriptures
[44:15] and pour out your spirit send a witness
[44:17] to the people's heart
[44:19] change their lives change your work and
[44:21] talk actions and attitudes
[44:23] granted lord and jesus we ask it amen
[44:26] you may be seated
[44:27] god bless you thanks again for coming
[44:29] out hallelujah
[44:31] your sacrifice coming out this morning
[44:34] will not be
[44:35] in vain
[44:41] it's good to be here it's always good to
[44:43] be in the presence of god
[44:44] in the house of god among god's people
[44:48] and on wednesday night uh we had a
[44:50] special time on wednesday night
[44:53] uh the true believers they're gonna
[44:54] follow the life
[44:56] that's what the true believer is going
[44:57] to follow now remember
[44:59] still let the main thing be the main
[45:02] thing the rest of the things are just
[45:04] filler material it's okay to work around
[45:07] with fellow material you know but don't
[45:08] stay there too long because
[45:10] the main thing is the main thing
[45:14] so this morning i have a title feeding
[45:17] on the unfailing body word
[45:20] of the son of man that's my title
[45:24] of a subject the son of man
[45:27] and i have an inspiration unless from
[45:29] mauritian 108 11 take it
[45:31] and eat it up which is that book
[45:35] amen praise the name of the lord you
[45:37] love him
[45:39] blessed be the name of the lord so i
[45:40] hope that god
[45:42] activate that twist in you the tooth for
[45:45] life
[45:46] a lot of people go to church but they're
[45:48] not twisting for life
[45:50] see twisting for life is something
[45:51] different you're hungering for something
[45:53] beyond you more than you above you is
[45:56] what god promised
[45:57] yes i come that you might have life you
[46:00] want
[46:01] to live you want to live for the lord
[46:03] you want his life
[46:05] inside of you you don't want to try a
[46:07] thing and have a religious spirit upon
[46:08] you
[46:09] because you know some religious stuff
[46:11] and you come to
[46:12] pay your respects and you know you come
[46:14] to church because you don't want people
[46:16] feel the backslide and so on you don't
[46:17] want to be in that mood
[46:18] you really come to toast
[46:21] for life and life means a change in a
[46:24] transformation because you born you have
[46:26] your own life
[46:27] your own desires your own thoughts your
[46:29] own ways your own ambition
[46:31] your own feelings and so on like that
[46:33] but this life is a different life
[46:35] this life is god's own life and the
[46:37] first gospel that jesus preaches that
[46:39] you must be born again
[46:40] so you could take your whole life and
[46:41] wrap it up with christianity wrap it up
[46:43] with a bible
[46:44] wrap it up with religious thought but
[46:45] that's not what he's talking about good
[46:47] behavior nice behavior and so on that's
[46:49] not what he's talking about
[46:51] he's talking about a real change a real
[46:53] change that god could really speak to
[46:55] you
[46:56] a real change that god could get to you
[46:58] god could rebuke you
[46:59] god could could instruct you and direct
[47:02] you
[47:03] many people don't want instructions
[47:04] guidance leading they don't want that
[47:06] they want what they want you see
[47:10] um so this book is not a chewing gum you
[47:13] chew it to it and then spit it out if
[47:14] you just chew it you get sweet you know
[47:16] you get the thing to taste
[47:18] it's sweet in the mouth but you have to
[47:19] eat it and when you take it and eat it
[47:22] once you eat it it gets bitter
[47:24] that's just how it is it's sweet in the
[47:27] mouth but when it digests
[47:29] when it goes on in the inner part when
[47:31] it sinks
[47:32] when the strike is subconscious it's not
[47:35] sweet so much down there because you
[47:36] have to stand for something now
[47:38] this is the inner man now this is in
[47:40] your heart now
[47:42] that's what you have to stand for okay
[47:44] so let's
[47:45] start now there was nothing in heaven
[47:47] that could have done it
[47:48] john looked the book the bible said he
[47:51] saw
[47:52] there was no one upon it was worthy to
[47:54] take the book the book of redemption
[47:55] there was nobody in heaven worthy nobody
[47:58] beneath the earth nowhere was able to
[47:59] worry to take the book
[48:00] and to loose the seals or even look on
[48:02] it and he wept
[48:04] because in this
[48:07] book was the book of redemption
[48:11] so there was a book in the book
[48:15] in this book was the book of redemption
[48:18] and this book of redemption had names
[48:21] that had to be called
[48:22] you couldn't miss it if you try god is
[48:25] not
[48:26] no compiling the book and compiling
[48:28] names
[48:29] those names are written before
[48:32] the foundation of the world so it's not
[48:35] as if god looking at your behavior and
[48:37] said because you behave nice
[48:38] he's going to put your name on the book
[48:40] he put your name on the book
[48:42] and then come for you whether you're in
[48:44] the bar
[48:45] whether you're smoking whether you're
[48:47] drinking
[48:48] whether you're sinning it doesn't matter
[48:51] what you were doing
[48:52] if your name is on the book he coming
[48:54] for you because all that the father had
[48:56] passed has given me
[48:58] shall come so this is not god ruling a
[49:01] dice
[49:02] and gambling this is a specific action
[49:05] a specific action to bring back what was
[49:08] fallen
[49:09] not by their fault but because of adam
[49:12] oh glory to god
[49:13] we were always supposed to be sons and
[49:15] daughters of god
[49:17] we were supposed to be born of god by
[49:20] spoken word through adam who had the
[49:22] names of the book
[49:23] but we fell from that and god promised
[49:26] to restore us back to that
[49:28] so you say he said you have to be born
[49:30] again of the word and of the spirit
[49:32] and if you have to be born again of the
[49:34] word and the spirit
[49:35] the word is therefore sealed in the book
[49:38] because that is where your true gene
[49:40] take a whole from the book itself
[49:43] now when you understand by revelation
[49:45] that your name is in the book
[49:46] there is enough devils in hell there is
[49:49] no devils on the earth
[49:50] there is not there is any atmosphere
[49:53] there is
[49:54] there is not enough devils and torment
[49:56] to stop you
[49:58] from pursuing the purpose that god
[50:00] raised you up for
[50:01] you can't help it this thing is built-in
[50:05] [Music]
[50:05] [Applause]
[50:07] [Music]
[50:09] you know when a baby time come to walk
[50:11] after crawling crawling crawling you
[50:12] know what is going on
[50:13] your mother could hold and grab the baby
[50:15] wriggling to come down because something
[50:17] inside that child is saying time to put
[50:18] me down
[50:19] i know i know where mine are crawling i
[50:22] i born to walk
[50:23] oh glory the god eyes are crawling is a
[50:25] stage and you crawling groveling is a
[50:28] stage
[50:29] god call you to walk to walk on your
[50:31] land
[50:32] to walk on your promises to walk on your
[50:34] inheritance you want to walk in it
[50:36] you are not a church member you send a
[50:39] prophet to get you out of church
[50:40] to rescue you from spirit of man you
[50:43] ain't a shout in the house
[50:46] this message is not to bring a new man
[50:48] to you is to
[50:49] deliver you from the spirit of man it's
[50:51] the spirit of man that crushed the
[50:53] church in the beginning
[50:54] on the nikolaiton spirit controlling
[50:56] laity
[50:57] the holy ghost itself was to run the
[50:59] church the holy ghost itself was to be
[51:01] upon the sons of god
[51:02] that was preaching the word of god but
[51:04] the holy ghost left
[51:05] because they went off the word and man
[51:08] take over
[51:09] when god was supposed to be having the
[51:10] preeminences man push yourself forward
[51:13] but this hour here call going and push
[51:15] out number six
[51:17] and number seven go step on the scene oh
[51:19] give the lord a shout in the house
[51:22] the lord himself yes and now the angel
[51:25] the lord himself descend from heaven
[51:28] with a shout
[51:29] and that shout is the seventh thunders
[51:31] off of revelation
[51:32] 8 1 oh glory to god revelation 10
[51:36] 3 and 4 he sent us out together bride
[51:38] together
[51:39] no devil no church man we're going to
[51:41] stop you from hearing the voice of god
[51:43] god has said no intimacy god has said no
[51:46] mary between you and him
[51:48] he going to speak direct once more
[51:51] the world will hear direct from god
[51:54] could we give the lord a
[51:55] shout oh hallelujah you may be seated
[52:00] but over you mean we are to hear direct
[52:04] from god
[52:05] yes shout out yes
[52:08] what did jesus access church who do men
[52:11] say
[52:13] i the son of man i am
[52:17] now he is not expecting you to say son
[52:18] of man
[52:20] who don't i men say i the son of man
[52:23] am some say you are this some say you
[52:26] are jeremiah
[52:27] some say isaac he said who do you say i
[52:30] am
[52:32] and then the disciples get caught daddy
[52:34] books and tapes of three and a half
[52:35] years there's still new years
[52:37] they read about him they study about him
[52:39] but they still don't know who he is
[52:41] because the father hair dropped down yet
[52:48] the only following this man with a beard
[52:53] the only following this man who's a
[52:54] messiah there's a ton of people in the
[52:56] message no
[52:57] following some man following somebody
[53:01] never heard from heaven all of a sudden
[53:04] peter
[53:04] all let me get caught you know who may
[53:06] say i am they watch one another like if
[53:08] she is not talking to them
[53:13] peter said there were the christ the son
[53:14] of the living god
[53:18] he don't have the holy ghost but you
[53:20] have revelation
[53:22] because the father the lord is that
[53:26] spirit
[53:27] the spirit dropped upon peter and it
[53:30] pelt out his mouth
[53:31] and jesus made an astonishing he said
[53:34] upon this
[53:35] rock which is revelation
[53:39] i want to i want to qualify that divine
[53:41] revelation
[53:43] they're not facts i'm not texts i'm not
[53:45] talk then a pastor teaches something
[53:47] that is divine revelation that is the
[53:50] spirit taking what is spoken out from
[53:52] the early pulpit and revealing to you
[53:54] so that you take that and put that in
[53:56] your pocket you're going with that
[53:58] there's nothing in your head that's in
[53:59] your heart your husband can't take it
[54:02] over to you
[54:02] your wife can't take it out of you
[54:04] childs can milk it out to you
[54:07] oh god have mercy a roof blow off that
[54:09] cat take it upon
[54:10] because upon this rock i will build my
[54:12] church and the gates of hell itself
[54:15] can prevail against it this church
[54:18] stands triumphant
[54:19] this church that jesus transcends
[54:22] triumphant
[54:23] and the devil himself is afraid of it oh
[54:26] glory to god
[54:28] hallelujah upon this rock i will build
[54:30] my church
[54:31] one day you're gonna know what the
[54:32] church is built on who is the church
[54:34] who is prophet at church and what that
[54:37] church stand for
[54:38] and what that church can do
[54:41] [Applause]
[54:42] oh glory to god you believe that
[54:47] so in that book was the book
[54:51] of redemption he's praying a prayer here
[54:54] you say there god made those are not
[54:57] that standing
[54:58] they want to accept you they realize
[55:00] lord this has not been done
[55:02] until this time and now you confirm it
[55:06] and prove that it is so father
[55:09] father that in their hearts that
[55:10] strangely move at this time
[55:12] how do we not know that this is the last
[55:15] person to come in
[55:16] this may be the end of los angeles
[55:20] this may be the last soul
[55:23] that will be born into the kingdom
[55:26] note his word he didn't say the last
[55:28] word that come into the message
[55:30] or the last soul that believed god and a
[55:32] prophet he's not talking about that
[55:35] he said maybe this is the last soul that
[55:37] come
[55:38] into the kingdom born into the kingdom
[55:41] we don't know when that time comes
[55:45] and when it does the door
[55:48] will be closed the body will be complete
[55:54] it will not be a freak body
[55:57] or a freak brain it will just have
[56:01] so many members whose names were put on
[56:04] the lands book of life
[56:06] before the foundation of the world to
[56:09] which
[56:09] jesus came to take like adam walked
[56:13] right out to save his wife i pray god
[56:15] that you receive them into the kingdom
[56:17] they in your hands deal with them lord i
[56:18] pray in jesus name
[56:20] so this is no gimmick this is not iffy
[56:24] thing this is not that
[56:25] this is the names in the book
[56:29] he come for them and he would lose none
[56:36] you heard that that should put all the
[56:38] fear out of your spirit
[56:40] all the fear out of your heart he shall
[56:43] lose
[56:45] none so therefore the unsealing of the
[56:48] seals the breaking of the seals
[56:51] was to release a prophetic vision
[56:54] without which the people will perish
[56:59] the vision is what makes you see the
[57:02] main thing
[57:04] outside the main thing you will see
[57:06] doctrine teachings topics
[57:08] but not the vision
[57:13] write the vision and make it plain
[57:17] every family home and marriage or
[57:19] business that have a vision
[57:21] is different from everybody else you
[57:23] could see somebody with a vision and
[57:25] somebody without
[57:27] somebody with vision of focus somebody
[57:30] with vision
[57:31] have a long-range story a long-range
[57:35] binoculars
[57:36] that is somebody with visions somebody
[57:38] without vision the only scene today for
[57:40] today
[57:41] they can't see a fire off and that way
[57:43] people say if these things be in you and
[57:45] a bomb
[57:46] they give you the ability to see a fire
[57:48] off oh glory to
[57:50] god hallelujah those who have don't have
[57:52] that is blind and tendency afar off
[57:55] the vision gives you the ability to stay
[57:57] fire off
[57:58] and you could work with patience towards
[58:01] accomplishing
[58:02] what the vision has revealed and nobody
[58:05] could show you all because you see in it
[58:08] oh give the lord a shout you can't
[58:11] expect others to see it when it's
[58:13] revealed to you
[58:15] or give the lord a shout you cannot give
[58:18] another human being a revelation
[58:23] you can't do that let's continue
[58:27] oh i'm going to skip it out this is from
[58:30] the time
[58:31] as john was sent to wind up the old
[58:34] testament
[58:36] and to bring forth the introduction of
[58:37] christ
[58:39] a message will wind up the loose ends
[58:42] and will introduce the messiah just

[1:03:20] that is why your anointing is not from
[1:03:21] the six seals
[1:03:23] your anointing is not from loose ends
[1:03:26] your anointing is not from
[1:03:27] interpretations and suggestions
[1:03:29] and mine ideas on what they think and
[1:03:31] what they study in some book
[1:03:32] your anointing is not from there when
[1:03:35] god pulled the sea for your anointing
[1:03:36] there was silence
[1:03:38] for a space of half an hour so the devil
[1:03:41] don't know nothing on the deal
[1:03:43] no demon could interpret that servancy
[1:03:45] to you
[1:03:46] he can't tell you what not there he

[1:03:59] oh glory to god hallelujah
[1:04:03] soon as the church is drawn together she
[1:04:06] is taken up there's the main thing
[1:04:08] in the mystery of the seventh seal or

[1:04:12] the mystery of going
[1:04:15] so the bride is going by the mystery of
[1:04:18] the seventh seal
[1:04:19] and the jews are going by the mystery of
[1:04:20] the seventh trumpet
[1:04:22] or give the lord a shout the trump is

[1:05:05] you that you will be called out
[1:05:08] elected for such a time as this
[1:05:12] because many are called to be church

[1:05:19] to be elected to be kept hallelujah
[1:05:23] with his capstone of divine love many
[1:05:26] are called but if you have chosen

[1:17:50] said
[1:17:51] he said watch them seven straight
[1:17:52] thunders right in a row one two three
[1:17:54] four five six seven
[1:17:55] perfect seven heavens couldn't write
[1:17:57] that heavens can't know nothing about it
[1:17:59] nothing else because there is
[1:18:00] nothing to go on it he said it's
[1:18:02] relaxing time
[1:18:05] it was so great it was kept secret from
[1:18:07] the angels
[1:18:08] why if satan get a hold of it he might
[1:18:11] do great
[1:18:12] damage there is one thing he don't know
[1:18:16] you see the other six seals he can rip
[1:18:18] that up
[1:18:20] but this is one thing he don't know he
[1:18:22] can interpret
[1:18:23] anything he wants to he can impersonate
[1:18:25] any kind of gift
[1:18:27] but he can't know this it's a total
[1:18:30] secret
[1:18:35] it's not even written in the words the
[1:18:36] total secret the angels everything shut
[1:18:39] up
[1:18:41] all the time there's noise in heaven
[1:18:42] hallelujah glory yes what
[1:18:44] blessing honor might but when the
[1:18:46] sermon's he broke
[1:18:50] angels who always singing
[1:18:53] bitched up
[1:18:58] he said they were awed by it they were
[1:19:00] stunned by it
[1:19:02] this mystery of under the seven seals
[1:19:06] stunned the angels oh glory to god the
[1:19:09] angels
[1:19:10] maybe they hide their face
[1:19:16] and god make sure what was under there
[1:19:20] didn't reveal itself in heaven
[1:19:24] and heaven was only silent but when it
[1:19:26] break the atmosphere
[1:19:28] and come unto the earth thunders
[1:19:31] throw their voices out the thunder's
[1:19:33] never offered in heaven
[1:19:37] the thunder's utter in the earth
[1:19:39] [Applause]
[1:19:41] glory to god so when the devil standing
[1:19:44] from his balcony
[1:19:45] of his access to see what's going on
[1:19:49] because you know you have a meet up
[1:19:50] there
[1:19:53] i wish i could see it but he keep my
[1:19:56] business
[1:19:57] accuse any veteran day at night so you
[1:20:00] have to have a gallery a portal
[1:20:02] where the debate like a prosecutor look
[1:20:04] what you do
[1:20:06] look look what you do look look we did
[1:20:08] last month look we last yeah look this
[1:20:09] look this that's his job
[1:20:11] you have a special portal waste and they
[1:20:13] argue with god

[1:20:19] blood once his name on the book he said
[1:20:22] look my blood i pay
[1:20:23] i pay for that it's not that he can't do
[1:20:25] it you know but he paid the price for
[1:20:26] that
[1:20:28] look the currency here
[1:20:32] so to the devil's answer jesus says i'll
[1:20:34] press repeat
[1:20:35] blood i'll put a record of blood i know
[1:20:38] you never have blood here to go back
[1:20:40] yeah no kiss but if the blood not over
[1:20:42] you have a case
[1:20:44] you say yeah yeah well i have no blood
[1:20:45] for that because i mean
[1:20:47] they accept my blood you have to deal
[1:20:48] with that oh once there's blood there
[1:20:51] a case is there calvary is there for you
[1:20:54] devil have no case
[1:20:56] your case has been diminished dismissed
[1:20:58] and you are justified
[1:21:00] as if you that didn't hit the right yet
[1:21:01] you know that hit you yet you know
[1:21:04] you are justified as if you never did it
[1:21:07] some people come and say do this and do
[1:21:08] this who do that
[1:21:09] which one of them that do that you talk
[1:21:11] about me you don't want me
[1:21:13] me who put god put my name in the book
[1:21:15] if god before us who could be against us
[1:21:17] is that no god put my name on the book
[1:21:19] you want to accuse me
[1:21:21] satan the accused of the break no wonder
[1:21:23] the bible says he's cast out
[1:21:24] he is cast down just are we losing that
[1:21:26] pose
[1:21:30] that accuser pulse that platforming only
[1:21:33] losing that just though
[1:21:34] he can't even go there oh glory to god
[1:21:38] when the bride goes up the devil comes
[1:21:40] down
[1:21:41] lost that position no more accusation
[1:21:44] the bride is free
[1:21:46] glory to god
[1:21:49] oh my there's going to be a pride i'm
[1:21:51] going to prove it to you there's going
[1:21:52] to be translation
[1:21:54] i'm going to prove it to you there's
[1:21:55] going to be change of the body i'll
[1:21:57] prove it to you
[1:21:58] oh hallelujah oh glory to god i ain't
[1:22:01] looking to get all and die and drop down
[1:22:03] at all
[1:22:04] i'm looking for this old carcass to be
[1:22:06] changed this gray hair turned back black
[1:22:09] and these old quicky bones gone back
[1:22:10] very young oh glory to
[1:22:13] god hallelujah praise god there be no
[1:22:16] crippling the rapture
[1:22:17] there be no blind people in the rapture
[1:22:19] there be no dumb deaf people in the
[1:22:21] rapture
[1:22:22] oh god have mercy he is coming for a
[1:22:24] perfect brain
[1:22:26] glory to god there's no sinners going to
[1:22:28] the rapture there's going to be mrs
[1:22:30] jesus christ
[1:22:31] she has to be part of jesus christ flesh
[1:22:33] of his flesh
[1:22:34] bone of his bone life of his life isn't
[1:22:38] that right
[1:22:42] remember satan will try to impersonate
[1:22:44] he will try to impersonate everything
[1:22:46] that the church will do
[1:22:48] we notice through the antichrist but
[1:22:50] this is one thing
[1:22:51] he cannot impersonate there'll be no
[1:22:54] mimics
[1:22:55] to this here's why here's the key to
[1:22:58] that
[1:22:58] because he don't know it
[1:23:02] one two there is no way here for him to
[1:23:06] know it
[1:23:07] tree it's the third pull he knows
[1:23:11] nothing about it he doesn't understand
[1:23:14] it
[1:23:18] so he is born by his ignorance
[1:23:22] he cannot understand it he cannot know
[1:23:26] it
[1:23:27] there is no way for him to know it so
[1:23:29] you and i become a mystery on the earth
[1:23:32] to lucifer
[1:23:36] that is why there's extra heat on your
[1:23:39] trial
[1:23:40] because two hundred thousand thousand
[1:23:43] devils
[1:23:44] have been loosed against the bride
[1:23:50] and them devils have been loosed to try
[1:23:52] to get you off the world
[1:23:54] but as long as you stay with the word
[1:23:57] god will show you a continuation of the
[1:23:59] word
[1:24:00] as long as you stay with the world he's
[1:24:03] going to confirm his word
[1:24:04] because he can only prove his word by
[1:24:07] believers
[1:24:11] oh glory to god do you see it this
[1:24:14] evening
[1:24:15] do you see it this morning hallelujah
[1:24:19] thank god
[1:24:23] so jesus said who do men say the son of
[1:24:26] man
[1:24:26] pieces of christ one said you never
[1:24:28] learned this i see it
[1:24:29] not to be big but to drive down a point
[1:24:31] you never learn this in some seminary
[1:24:33] some man never taught you this but my
[1:24:35] father which is in heaven
[1:24:37] has revealed this to you that i am not
[1:24:39] father and holy ghost but i am jesus
[1:24:41] christ
[1:24:42] and upon this rock what rock the same
[1:24:44] one evil went on
[1:24:45] the same rock upon this rock this
[1:24:47] spiritual
[1:24:48] spiritual revealed truth of god i'll
[1:24:50] build my church
[1:24:51] he said the gaze of hell will never
[1:24:53] prevail against it so god alone holds
[1:24:55] this key
[1:24:56] this key to revelation god alone holds
[1:25:00] the key
[1:25:01] isn't that right and he said no he said
[1:25:03] what the
[1:25:04] christ the son of the living god he said
[1:25:06] blessed are those simon son of jonah
[1:25:08] flesh and blood never reveal it to you
[1:25:10] reveal it to you but my father was in
[1:25:12] heaven and upon this revelation
[1:25:14] alone i'd be my church therefore here we
[1:25:17] go
[1:25:18] there is no school no theologian
[1:25:21] no teachings of the bible among any
[1:25:23] school that knows anything about it they
[1:25:26] cannot know nothing about it
[1:25:28] it is impossible for them to know
[1:25:29] anything about it god has
[1:25:31] hit the senses of knowing it from the
[1:25:33] very elected teachers
[1:25:37] he did that hit the senses of knowing it
[1:25:40] no they could talk it like intellectual
[1:25:42] talk but knowing that by revelation they
[1:25:44] don't have it
[1:25:47] you talk about the elected teachers
[1:25:51] let's go down
[1:25:54] it's a personal individual of fear with
[1:25:57] the person
[1:25:58] that christ is revealed to them oh you
[1:26:01] think back now
[1:26:02] when you came to the lord who was there
[1:26:04] somebody testified to your
[1:26:05] book a bible whatever it is and the lord
[1:26:07] break your heart and you're coming you
[1:26:08] want to get baptized
[1:26:09] that whole operation wasn't a man think
[1:26:12] back about that
[1:26:13] there was no denomination there was
[1:26:15] nothing
[1:26:18] all of that was god you can't convict
[1:26:21] yourself it's a spirit that convicts you
[1:26:24] you can't just say i want to get
[1:26:25] baptized with water no something
[1:26:27] pulling you to the word that you want to
[1:26:30] obey the word
[1:26:32] order that was god god preserve you and
[1:26:36] keep you and then you come to the church
[1:26:38] and then start to learn of god and learn
[1:26:40] of the world because you don't know him
[1:26:42] and to know him you have to get his word
[1:26:46] guys like god tell moses bring them two
[1:26:48] million people out to this mountain
[1:26:50] because they don't know me
[1:26:54] they know the galaxy and leaves from
[1:26:55] egypt they know their life in egypt but
[1:26:57] they don't know my word
[1:26:59] bring them to this mountain that i could
[1:27:00] reveal my law to them
[1:27:04] when moses going up there dancing and
[1:27:06] prancing
[1:27:07] partying because they get liberty now
[1:27:09] they're not no longer on the pharaoh
[1:27:10] lockdown
[1:27:14] so now they're not on the pharaoh
[1:27:16] lockdown they start a on the bottom of
[1:27:18] god mountain
[1:27:20] moses hearing from god seeing theophany
[1:27:22] asking a little backpack to see god's
[1:27:24] face

[1:27:32] written by the hand of god fireballs and
[1:27:34] a stone
[1:27:35] and the people dancing and partying
[1:27:36] making a golden calf

[1:27:51] the mountain
[1:27:51] people partying and dancing and carrying
[1:27:53] on fornicating adultery and carrying on
[1:27:56] and a man hearing direct from god on the
[1:27:58] mountain of god
[1:28:00] oh glory to god fire fire in the
[1:28:02] mountain
[1:28:03] when moses come down he said my god
[1:28:06] who is on the lord's side hallelujah

[1:28:11] or give the lord a shout god kill them
[1:28:14] the same people that came on god kill
[1:28:17] them
[1:28:18] and the same people in this message that
[1:28:19] come out god will kill them
[1:28:21] if they don't want to continue with the
[1:28:22] word this is no game
[1:28:25] as it wasn't visa noah so shall it be in
[1:28:27] the days
[1:28:28] of the son of man they eat they drank
[1:28:31] they bought control
[1:28:32] but something supernatural was happening
[1:28:35] oh give the lord a praise offering this
[1:28:37] morning
[1:28:38] hallelujah hallelujah glory to god
[1:28:42] this is not a pentecostal church this is
[1:28:44] not a regular
[1:28:45] church god has come down in this hour
[1:28:49] to reveal himself to this age to call a
[1:28:52] bride out

[1:29:16] they know nothing about it god is known
[1:29:20] by simplicity and of revelation of jesus
[1:29:23] christ
[1:29:23] and the most illiterate person upon this
[1:29:27] rock i'll build my truth that is why you
[1:29:28] don't need education to hear from god
[1:29:31] because the most illiterate person could
[1:29:33] get revelation from god
[1:29:35] that no man could take it out of their
[1:29:37] heart you don't have to be able to read
[1:29:38] or write

[1:29:41] that might say a new heart i will give
[1:29:42] you
[1:29:43] a new spirit i'll put within you and
[1:29:45] i'll write bits in your heart my laws
[1:29:47] the same god that wrote in them rocks
[1:29:49] ten commandments

[1:29:58] you could leave here with a new mind
[1:30:00] with a you heart with a
[1:30:01] a new way of thinking a new approach god
[1:30:04] could

[1:30:07] could break up on your soul even right
[1:30:09] now
[1:30:10] while the world is going forward a silly
[1:30:12] knife cut out what is not of him

[1:31:22] you applied it
[1:31:23] you answered that
[1:31:28] bible talk about people in here in the
[1:31:29] wood here in the wood man like a man in
[1:31:31] him looking in miranda forget what mana
[1:31:33] manny is
[1:31:34] not to do all the words just hearing god
[1:31:36] said my people the people they only like
[1:31:38] to approach me with a mouth
[1:31:39] but the heart is far from me they sit on
[1:31:42] so long they're rotten in the message
[1:31:44] the religious sending message the weary
[1:31:46] in the message the killing time in the
[1:31:48] message
[1:31:49] killing time on the premises wake up
[1:31:51] church
[1:31:53] still your spirit up oh glory to god is
[1:31:56] a rumbling in the camp
[1:31:58] a rumbling of god oh hallelujah
[1:32:01] hallelujah praise god
[1:32:03] he said no other roman rock no other
[1:32:05] protestant rock no other school nor than
[1:32:07] nothing
[1:32:07] he is born in there and he injects his
[1:32:10] own life
[1:32:10] and your life is gone and the life of
[1:32:13] christ
[1:32:14] is projecting itself through you
[1:32:17] here we go the life of who of christ not
[1:32:20] your anger not your temper not your
[1:32:22] cussing
[1:32:22] not your bad behavior not your rude
[1:32:24] mouth not your attitude
[1:32:26] not that that is you the life of christ
[1:32:29] is projecting itself to you
[1:32:31] because something happened inside of you
[1:32:35] and it's working as well
[1:32:40] there's a father like projection up to
[1:32:42] you with the preeminences to the people
[1:32:45] that they see the very life and works

[1:36:00] watch god's revelation unfolding by
[1:36:04] lack of this revelation
[1:36:08] not by more revelation by lack of it is
[1:36:11] why we have so much different divisions
[1:36:14] so divisions is not come by people are
[1:36:16] revelations is luck
[1:36:17] lack of revelation the right one
[1:36:21] because revelation is sovereign that's
[1:36:24] the word people don't like to hear none
[1:36:26] at all
[1:36:27] they don't like the word sovereign
[1:36:29] because anytime you stop sovereign you
[1:36:30] have to tell them get off my back
[1:36:32] don't try to kind of run me there's no
[1:36:35] secret asian thing where you're trying
[1:36:36] to run the past you try to do anything
[1:36:38] behind here don't try that
[1:36:39] we will cut your head off
[1:36:42] sovereign means no external forces
[1:36:46] influence influencing the church
[1:36:50] the pastor is led by the holy spirit to
[1:36:53] preach
[1:36:54] whatever he feels led to preach

[1:37:33] had 12 people it's still sovereign
[1:37:35] i bust a man when we had five in cairo i
[1:37:38] said you're trying to say there's a
[1:37:39] convention

[1:38:05] somebody could be back said in 50 years
[1:38:07] coming here this morning and god
[1:38:08] revealed himself to them and you can't
[1:38:10] get better at god
[1:38:11] because he is suffering
[1:38:15] you could get a breakthrough in five
[1:38:17] minutes because he is
[1:38:18] suffering you could be healed in three
[1:38:21] minutes because he
[1:38:22] is oh god could do anything this morning
[1:38:26] oh give the lord a shout
[1:38:34] god's sovereignty to your life is not
[1:38:36] dependent upon me
[1:38:37] or the preaching or the teaching

[1:39:50] [Applause]
[1:39:54] let me be seated by lack of this
[1:39:57] revelation
[1:39:58] is why we are so much divisions among us
[1:40:01] so much
[1:40:01] mockery so much divisions among us
[1:40:04] because the people like that revelation
[1:40:06] they lack that revelation the teachers
[1:40:10] the teachers the teachers lack that
[1:40:13] revelation
[1:40:14] see all right
[1:40:19] can we continue we want to talk about a
[1:40:22] man in the scriptures here
[1:40:24] genesis 14
[1:40:28] verse 18 says and melchizedek king of
[1:40:31] salem
[1:40:32] brought forth bread and wine and he was
[1:40:34] the priest of the most high god
[1:40:37] and he blessed him this is abraham after
[1:40:39] abram fought brought back a lot from me
[1:40:41] and delivered lot after ibram fought
[1:40:42] this man named melchizedek
[1:40:45] he brought him wine and bread brahman
[1:40:48] said he could give
[1:40:52] god give after victory after battle
[1:40:55] communion
[1:40:56] communion and no star this thing is
[1:40:57] wheat back then
[1:40:59] wine and bread oh give the lord some
[1:41:02] praises
[1:41:04] and he blessed him and said blessed be
[1:41:05] abraham of the most high god
[1:41:07] possessed of him alert and blessed be
[1:41:10] the most high god which are delivered
[1:41:11] thy enemies into thy hand
[1:41:13] and he gave him tights of all oh my
[1:41:18] hebrews chapter 5 speaking about the
[1:41:21] same man
[1:41:22] for every high priest taken among men is
[1:41:24] ordained of men and things pertaining to
[1:41:26] god
[1:41:27] that he may offer both gifts and
[1:41:29] sacrifices for sins
[1:41:30] so christ glorified not himself to be
[1:41:32] made in high priest
[1:41:34] but he said unto him thou what my son
[1:41:36] today i have begotten thee
[1:41:38] and he said in another place the what a
[1:41:40] priest forever
[1:41:41] after the order of merchandise
[1:41:44] as he said in another place though at a
[1:41:46] priest forever after the order of
[1:41:48] melchizedek who in the days of his flesh
[1:41:50] when he had offered up prayers and
[1:41:52] supplication with strong crying and
[1:41:53] tears
[1:41:54] unto him that was able to save him from
[1:41:56] death was heard
[1:41:57] in that he feared though he was a son
[1:42:00] yet
[1:42:00] learnt he obedient by the things which
[1:42:03] he suffered
[1:42:04] and being made perfect he became the
[1:42:07] author
[1:42:08] of eternal salvation unto all them that
[1:42:10] obey him
[1:42:11] called of god a high priest
[1:42:15] after the order of melchizedek oh glory
[1:42:18] to god
[1:42:19] and wherein god willing more abundantly
[1:42:22] to show unto the heirs of promise
[1:42:24] the immutability of his will of his
[1:42:27] counsel and confirmed by oat
[1:42:29] that in two immutable things in which
[1:42:31] it's impossible for god to lie
[1:42:33] we have a strong consolation who have
[1:42:36] fled for refuge to lay whole
[1:42:37] upon the hope set before us which hope
[1:42:40] we have as an
[1:42:41] anchor of the soul the soul can get an
[1:42:43] anchor
[1:42:44] not tossed and driven by the anchor when
[1:42:47] you drop down the no dublicate movie
[1:42:49] oh glory to god the anchor for the soul
[1:42:52] both show and steadfast which enter it
[1:42:55] into that within the veil
[1:42:56] whether the forerunner is for us entered
[1:42:58] even jesus he went before us
[1:43:00] made a high priest forever after the
[1:43:03] order of melchizedek
[1:43:05] is from chapter six chapter seven for
[1:43:08] this melchizedek
[1:43:10] king of salem priest of the mosh high
[1:43:12] god
[1:43:13] who met abraham returning from the
[1:43:15] slaughter of the kings and blessed him
[1:43:16] to whom also abraham gave a ten part of
[1:43:19] all first by being interpretation king
[1:43:21] of righteousness
[1:43:22] after that king of silence which is king
[1:43:24] of peace without father this man called
[1:43:26] meditate
[1:43:27] without mother this man called me
[1:43:29] chester no father no mother
[1:43:31] without descent having neither beginning
[1:43:34] of days no end of life
[1:43:35] but made like unto the son of god abided
[1:43:38] the priests continually
[1:43:40] and consider how great this man was unto
[1:43:42] whom even the patriarch abraham
[1:43:44] gave a tent of the spoils and verily day
[1:43:47] that
[1:43:47] of the sons of levi who was
[1:43:50] received the office of the priesthood
[1:43:52] have a commandment to take tithes of the
[1:43:54] people
[1:43:55] according to the law that is of their
[1:43:57] brethren though
[1:43:58] they come out of the loins of abraham
[1:44:00] for he whose descent is not counted from
[1:44:03] them
[1:44:03] received heights of abraham and bless
[1:44:06] them him that
[1:44:07] made the promises let me skip a little
[1:44:09] bit
[1:44:10] and i may say also levi also who
[1:44:12] received tights
[1:44:13] paid tithes in abraham levi pay tyson
[1:44:17] abram for he was yet in the loins of his
[1:44:19] father when melchizedek met him
[1:44:22] therefore if therefore perfection
[1:44:26] were of the levitical priesthood for
[1:44:28] under it was the people received the law
[1:44:30] what further need was there to have
[1:44:32] another priest should rise
[1:44:34] after the order of melchizedek
[1:44:37] hallelujah
[1:44:38] and not being called after the order of
[1:44:40] iran for the priesthood being changed
[1:44:43] there must have necessity a change also
[1:44:45] of the law
[1:44:47] so it wasn't the aaronic priesthood was
[1:44:49] the priesthood after the order of
[1:44:51] manchester
[1:44:51] united for whom these things are spoken
[1:44:54] pertaining to another tribe of which
[1:44:56] no man give attendance at the altar for
[1:44:59] it is evident
[1:45:00] that our lord spangled the judah of the
[1:45:03] tribe moses spake
[1:45:04] nothing considering priesthood it is far
[1:45:06] more evident
[1:45:07] that after the similitude of mercedes
[1:45:10] they arise at another priest
[1:45:12] who was made not after the law of cannon
[1:45:14] commandment
[1:45:15] but after the power of an endless life
[1:45:17] for he testified that what a priest
[1:45:19] forever
[1:45:20] after the order of melchizedek for there
[1:45:23] is verily a disanon of the commandment
[1:45:25] going before
[1:45:26] for the weakness and unprofitableness
[1:45:28] thereof for the law made nothing perfect
[1:45:31] but the bringing of a better hope did by
[1:45:33] which we draw nigh unto god
[1:45:35] for in as much as not without an oath he
[1:45:38] was made priests
[1:45:38] but those priests were made without an
[1:45:40] oat but this with an oat
[1:45:42] by him that said the lord swear and will
[1:45:45] not repent
[1:45:46] the what a priest forever after the
[1:45:48] order of mercedes
[1:45:50] by so much that jesus was made a shorty
[1:45:54] of a better testament and they're truly
[1:45:56] of many priests because they will
[1:45:58] not suffer to continue by reason of
[1:46:00] death but this man
[1:46:01] because he continued forever had made an
[1:46:04] unchangeable priesthood
[1:46:06] wherefore he's able to save them to the
[1:46:09] utmost
[1:46:10] that come unto god oh glory to god
[1:46:13] because he could intercede continually
[1:46:15] our unchangeable priesthood a priesthood
[1:46:18] according to the order of melchizedek
[1:46:20] oh glory to god pleaded on your behalf
[1:46:24] hallelujah that one we we
[1:46:30] worry to read again but this man because
[1:46:33] he continued
[1:46:34] forever had an unchangeable priesthood
[1:46:37] wherefore he is able also to save them
[1:46:40] to the uttermost
[1:46:41] that come unto god by him seeing him
[1:46:44] forever to make intercession for them
[1:46:47] for such a high priest became us who is
[1:46:50] holy harmless
[1:46:51] undefiled separate from sinners made
[1:46:53] higher than the heavens
[1:46:54] who kneeled not daily as those high
[1:46:56] priests to offer up sacrifice not daily
[1:46:59] first for his own sins and then for the
[1:47:01] people
[1:47:02] but this he did once when he offered
[1:47:04] himself
[1:47:05] oh glory to god the priests in the old
[1:47:08] testament had to offer sins to himself
[1:47:10] and for the people but this priest he
[1:47:13] offered himself
[1:47:14] only once he had perfected forever
[1:47:17] then that are sanctified oh god oh glory
[1:47:20] to god hallelujah
[1:47:23] hallelujah who needed that daily as
[1:47:26] those high priests to offer up sacrifice
[1:47:28] first for his own sins and then of the
[1:47:30] people for this he did once
[1:47:32] when he offered up himself for the law
[1:47:34] make it men high priest which have been
[1:47:36] filmity
[1:47:37] but the word of the oath which was since
[1:47:39] the law
[1:47:40] maketh the son who is consecrated
[1:47:43] forevermore oh glory to god i thank god
[1:47:47] i get you that one
[1:47:48] i tell myself i don't know how to reach
[1:47:50] all these scriptures but i read it true
[1:47:52] oh glory to god ever i met a man i'm a
[1:47:54] serious man
[1:47:55] no father no mother no descent had no
[1:47:58] beginning of life
[1:48:00] no ending of days that man is still
[1:48:02] alive tonight
[1:48:03] oh glory to god that is god oh glory to
[1:48:06] god he's eternal
[1:48:08] oh glory to god hallelujah and jesus was
[1:48:10] made after the order
[1:48:12] of the priest of melchizedek hallelujah
[1:48:14] praise god
[1:48:16] hallelujah hallelujah there is no way
[1:48:19] god could get to you outside of
[1:48:21] revelation
[1:48:22] that is the only way god is getting man
[1:48:25] not by your feelings
[1:48:26] not by your emotions but by revelation
[1:48:29] when god speaks you and reveal himself
[1:48:31] that is how he gets the man
[1:48:33] oh glory to god the whole bible
[1:48:37] is the revelation of god and this from a
[1:48:38] mission who's in merchandise the whole
[1:48:40] church is built upon the revelation of
[1:48:42] god
[1:48:42] there is no other way to know god only
[1:48:44] by revelation
[1:48:46] isn't that right to whom the son will
[1:48:47] reveal him everything is revelation
[1:48:50] oh glory to god revelation is everything
[1:48:54] if abraham was looking at his own senses
[1:48:56] he never confess he'll have a child
[1:48:59] it's revelation that he had in isaac
[1:49:02] that was so much inside him he couldn't
[1:49:03] give sarah that
[1:49:04] sarah had no revelation god gave the
[1:49:07] manly revelation
[1:49:08] and leave the woman out of it so same
[1:49:10] man was grumping complaining
[1:49:12] fussing and abraham to believe god for
[1:49:14] himself and sarah also
[1:49:16] and an old man watching the old woman
[1:49:18] and believe god that go
[1:49:19] translate and transform both of them oh
[1:49:22] glory if abraham had that faith in the
[1:49:24] beginning
[1:49:25] and we are royal seeds of abraham let me
[1:49:28] say that again
[1:49:29] if abraham had faith in the beginning
[1:49:31] and we are royal seed of abraham
[1:49:32] god would expect us to have faith to be

[1:51:02] father no mother
[1:51:04] no beginning of days no end of life it
[1:51:06] was god and murphy
[1:51:08] and the world the word greek word means
[1:51:11] change
[1:51:12] it means to change like on a stage act
[1:51:15] one person is changing this mask to make
[1:51:18] another character
[1:51:20] recently i went to a play our
[1:51:21] shakespeare and one young man had to
[1:51:23] change his clothes several times
[1:51:25] because he played two or three different
[1:51:27] parts the same person
[1:51:29] he come at one time as the villain then
[1:51:30] he come out next time another character
[1:51:32] and the greek word and morphe means to
[1:51:34] change his mask
[1:51:36] and that is what god did in the same god
[1:51:39] all is the same god all the time
[1:51:41] god in the form of the father the spirit
[1:51:43] the power of fire
[1:51:44] the same god has made flesh and breath
[1:51:46] among us and murphy
[1:51:48] brought us out so he could be seen and
[1:51:50] now that same god is the holy ghost
[1:51:52] father son holy ghost three offices
[1:51:55] three acts
[1:51:56] of one god notice like a sculpture
[1:51:59] he hides a mask over it that's what god
[1:52:02] has done to this age
[1:52:03] it's been hid all these things has been
[1:52:06] hit and it's supposed to be revealed in
[1:52:08] this age
[1:52:09] and the bible says that they will be
[1:52:11] revealed in the latter times
[1:52:13] it's like a sculpture keeping his peace
[1:52:16] of the world covered up until the time
[1:52:18] he take the mask off and there it is
[1:52:21] and that is what the bible has been it
[1:52:24] has been a work of god
[1:52:26] that's been covered up and it's been hid
[1:52:28] since the foundation of the world
[1:52:30] and is a sevenfold mystery and god
[1:52:32] promised and this day
[1:52:34] at the age of this laureation church he
[1:52:36] would take the mask
[1:52:37] of the whole thing and we would see it
[1:52:39] what a glorious thing
[1:52:42] god and morphy mask in the pillar of
[1:52:44] fire
[1:52:45] hallelujah hallelujah
[1:52:48] god and morphe in a man called jesus god
[1:52:51] and morphy in his church
[1:52:53] god above us god with us god in us
[1:52:57] condescending
[1:52:59] all glory to god and when god came along
[1:53:01] and change his tent
[1:53:02] and come down and live with us he become
[1:53:04] one of us
[1:53:06] first timothy 3 16 without controversy
[1:53:09] great is the mystery of godliness
[1:53:11] for god was manifested in the flesh
[1:53:13] handled with hands
[1:53:15] god eat meat god drank water
[1:53:18] god slept god cried he was one of us
[1:53:23] beautifully tight in the bible not
[1:53:26] seeing god coming back coming back
[1:53:27] coming back coming back
[1:53:29] oh glory to god will be guarding you do
[1:53:32] you believe that
[1:53:33] here's the part i want to get to god

[1:59:37] fellowship
[1:59:38] god loves fellowship that's what he made
[1:59:40] the man at the first time for was
[1:59:42] fellowship
[1:59:43] because he did well alone and he had
[1:59:46] enough of this alone thing
[1:59:50] he had enough of this alone thing
[1:59:54] that was history foreign
[2:00:15] was all alone he wanted fellowship
[2:00:18] angels worship him but that is not his
[2:00:19] kind that angels created
[2:00:22] was in the back part of his mind had
[2:00:23] sons sons and daughters not yet
[2:00:26] expressed
[2:00:27] oh glory to god just think about it now
[2:00:29] think about your little baby child

[2:00:43] until they say the talk
[2:00:45] and understand where they're talking
[2:00:47] then you can fellowship
[2:00:49] so god wait on this or until the
[2:00:51] fullness
[2:00:52] could be revealed that when you begin to
[2:00:54] pray and talk to your god
[2:00:56] you could talk with some sense

[2:01:09] come
[2:01:10] where it's supposed to be of clarity of
[2:01:12] vision of purpose
[2:01:14] division should be made plain oh glory
[2:01:17] to god
[2:01:18] plain so plain that nobody could throw
[2:01:22] you off
[2:01:23] of what you're supposed to be focused on
[2:01:25] as your inheritance as your promise as
[2:01:27] what you're pressing after
[2:01:28] as paul said forgetting in the past i
[2:01:30] pressed towards the mark what is that
[2:01:32] mark
[2:01:33] of the high calling in christ jesus that
[2:01:36] market at a church

[2:03:06] the prophet and the bride will say the
[2:03:09] same thing
[2:03:10] and what they say will already be said
[2:03:13] in the word

[2:03:24] certain of me
[2:03:26] hallelujah oh glory to god could you
[2:03:29] take a little more
[2:03:31] when moses saw him exodus 20 33 2 he was
[2:03:34] a teopany
[2:03:35] moses wanted to see god he had heard his
[2:03:37] voice he heard him talk to him and seen
[2:03:39] him in a bush
[2:03:40] and god said no man shall see my voice
[2:03:42] i'll put my hand over your eyes
[2:03:44] i'll pass and you will see my backpack
[2:03:46] not my face
[2:03:47] and when he did he saw the back part of
[2:03:49] a man hallelujah the word came to moses
[2:03:52] in the form of the pillar of fire in a
[2:03:55] burning bush
[2:03:56] the i am hang in there hang in there
[2:03:58] don't sleep on me right now
[2:03:59] don't get worried just a little more
[2:04:00] again we're going to push there's a last
[2:04:02] service in this kind of form where you
[2:04:04] will be here
[2:04:05] oh glory to god so just right with me
[2:04:07] right now this is very important
[2:04:09] my god i was so excited when this broke
[2:04:11] upon me i couldn't wait to get here to
[2:04:13] minister this this morning
[2:04:15] hallelujah hallelujah as the word of
[2:04:18] theology from the theophany rather
[2:04:20] excuse me
[2:04:20] he came to abraham as a man under the
[2:04:23] oak tree
[2:04:24] he switched to abraham now now look here
[2:04:27] there
[2:04:27] is a man came to him why did he come
[2:04:30] why did he come abraham being the one
[2:04:34] with the promise
[2:04:36] and the message of the coming son and
[2:04:39] also he was a god prophet that was
[2:04:41] trusting god's word isn't that right
[2:04:44] the word comes to the prophet you said
[2:04:46] the word in a theophany
[2:04:49] you said was that god abraham said it
[2:04:51] was
[2:04:52] he said his name he called him elohim
[2:04:55] now genesis 1 you find out in the
[2:04:57] beginning
[2:04:57] elohim created the heavens and the earth
[2:05:00] and abram said it was elohim
[2:05:02] he was in t orphan he formed so the
[2:05:05] prophet in this same message you should
[2:05:06] listen to it who's in my chest he talked
[2:05:08] about the thought a word is that not
[2:05:10] expressed
[2:05:11] and god moved from supernatural spirit
[2:05:14] into a word body called a tiophony that
[2:05:17] was the logos
[2:05:18] then he come step forward luther to let
[2:05:20] us make man
[2:05:21] isn't that right so what it is elohim in
[2:05:24] theory form
[2:05:25] we find out he was in t orphany form he
[2:05:27] called him lord god elohim
[2:05:29] notice but no matter how many abraham
[2:05:31] saw it it was one lord everyone said my
[2:05:33] lord
[2:05:34] this was merchandise
[2:05:39] so the man that came to abraham with two
[2:05:41] other men he said
[2:05:43] this was the melchizedek notice after
[2:05:46] the battle was over
[2:05:47] melchizedek served his victorious child
[2:05:49] communion think of it
[2:05:51] part of himself he said jacob russell
[2:05:53] all night
[2:05:54] wouldn't turn him loose until he blessed
[2:05:56] him that's right and after battle is
[2:05:58] over
[2:05:58] then god gives you of himself that is
[2:06:01] true communion
[2:06:02] you see this little bread and water just
[2:06:05] represents it you shouldn't take it
[2:06:06] unless you wrestle it out
[2:06:08] and become part of god but melchizedek
[2:06:11] after his child abraham won the victory
[2:06:14] melchizedek met him
[2:06:15] and gave him bread and wine showing that
[2:06:17] after this early battle is over we will
[2:06:19] meet with him in the heavens and take
[2:06:20] communion again
[2:06:22] it will be the wedding supper i will not
[2:06:24] drink no more of the vine

[2:08:52] see here plainly
[2:08:53] oh god skip that notice it is three
[2:08:57] stages for
[2:08:58] perfection just like he redeems the
[2:08:59] world the same reading this church
[2:09:01] now this book whose is my chance that
[2:09:03] was uh
[2:09:05] i see the 21st of
[2:09:08] february 1965. this was one of the
[2:09:11] mysteries
[2:09:12] that was revealed under the seventh seal
[2:09:15] the one in mississippi who is this
[2:09:16] merchandise and insider this year there
[2:09:19] was such a bomb such an explosion
[2:09:20] because we take things for granted
[2:09:22] but right inside of here he talked about
[2:09:24] there are three stages to perfection
[2:09:26] just like he redeems the world
[2:09:27] same reading the church he redeems the
[2:09:28] people in three stages first
[2:09:30] justification
[2:09:31] like literally preach second
[2:09:32] signification like where they preach
[2:09:34] third
[2:09:34] baptist then comes the rapture no
[2:09:37] here we go nobody knew this what we
[2:09:39] about to read here now nobody knew it
[2:09:41] before
[2:09:41] listen to this no the world how did he
[2:09:44] read in the world the first what he did
[2:09:45] his sin he washed it off with water
[2:09:47] baptism
[2:09:48] then he dropped the blood on it from the
[2:09:50] cross and sanctified
[2:09:51] to call his own then what he do he tore
[2:09:53] the world out of you
[2:09:55] and renovated the whole thing by a fiery
[2:09:57] baptism of the holy ghost
[2:09:59] he will also renovate the world he is
[2:10:02] typing what god do in the earth now
[2:10:03] watch
[2:10:04] people by doctrine and teach and see
[2:10:06] noah and the flood came
[2:10:08] but the real higher order of the
[2:10:10] revelation of that
[2:10:11] is that god is redeeming the earth and
[2:10:13] lucifer didn't know that
[2:10:17] all lucifer do have people sinning and
[2:10:18] carrying on and god know from grace in
[2:10:20] god's sight
[2:10:21] god call out no once i got drunk here

[2:10:25] natural level here you see in flood man
[2:10:28] ark noah preaching around 20 years flood
[2:10:31] come and destroy them all
[2:10:33] but at the higher level that's the first
[2:10:35] stage
[2:10:37] of god redeeming the earth itself the
[2:10:39] earth that lucifer is squatter
[2:10:41] thinking he is in charge of god already
[2:10:44] done pay
[2:10:45] i started to redeem it blood hit it when

[2:16:04] [Music]
[2:16:07] [Applause]
[2:16:14] glory glory
[2:16:18] i've given you something to write about
[2:16:19] now showing much
[2:16:21] the natural birth is tree what happened
[2:16:23] when a woman having a baby first break
[2:16:24] water
[2:16:25] next is blood then it's life water blood
[2:16:27] spirit
[2:16:28] god vindicates that it has always been
[2:16:30] right god finish finnick to be true
[2:16:32] so plainly the predestinated is the only
[2:16:35] one
[2:16:36] that is considering the redemption did
[2:16:39] you get it
[2:16:40] he said let me say it again the
[2:16:42] predestinated is the only one
[2:16:44] that is considered in redemption people
[2:16:47] might be making like the thing they are
[2:16:49] but the real redemption is those that
[2:16:50] are predestinated
[2:16:52] because the word redeem is to bring back
[2:16:54] is that right
[2:16:55] to redeem is something to redeem
[2:16:56] anything is to bring it back to its
[2:16:58] original place so if it's only
[2:17:00] predestinated we'll be brought back
[2:17:03] so who we phone you he called who he
[2:17:06] called
[2:17:06] justified who he justified he had
[2:17:08] already glorified
[2:17:10] oh glory to god let me say it again
[2:17:12] don't look at your sins and your
[2:17:13] feelings and shortcomings
[2:17:15] look the fact that you were for known no
[2:17:18] you'll get delivered
[2:17:22] who informed you he called
[2:17:26] hallelujah being eternal with him at the
[2:17:29] beginning
[2:17:30] eternal life that you had he's told that
[2:17:32] he was
[2:17:33] he wanted you he wanted me to stand in
[2:17:36] the pulpit
[2:17:37] to say he wanted you to sit in that seat
[2:17:38] tonight then we are serving his eternal
[2:17:40] purpose
[2:17:41] one that left home only come to the
[2:17:43] earth to serve his purpose is that right
[2:17:45] and it's brought back to your glorified
[2:17:47] state it is matured and is brought back
[2:17:49] hallelujah so jesus who
[2:17:53] he was alive in the old testament
[2:17:55] manifested
[2:17:57] so that is why jesus tell them abraham
[2:17:59] so mighty and rejoiced
[2:18:06] jesus said abraham saw my day and
[2:18:09] rejoice
[2:18:10] and they blessed jesus until for your
[2:18:12] father greater neighbor he said before
[2:18:13] abraham was i
[2:18:14] am.
[2:18:16] [Music]
[2:18:17] [Applause]
[2:18:19] because jesus met abraham not as jesus
[2:18:28] oh glory to god so he said jesus says
[2:18:31] abraham saw my day
[2:18:32] and rejoiced let's continue here
[2:18:35] he said no what he was alive when the
[2:18:37] old testament manifested
[2:18:39] i just want you to see a little
[2:18:40] something here if you can stand it
[2:18:43] when jesus was manifested in the old
[2:18:46] testament as we believe it
[2:18:47] now you preachers out there you can
[2:18:48] argue with it do whatever you want
[2:18:52] but i'm talking what i think when jesus
[2:18:55] was manifested in the old testament in a
[2:18:56] theophany
[2:18:57] in the personal melchizedek not a
[2:18:59] priesthood
[2:19:00] but a person the man this man was not
[2:19:03] yet born
[2:19:04] but he wasn't antiophany so he had no
[2:19:06] father no mother he was god himself
[2:19:09] he was manifested in the form of a man
[2:19:11] king of salem which means king of peace
[2:19:14] king of righteousness he was melchizedek
[2:19:16] he neither had father no mother
[2:19:17] big enough there's no end of life it was
[2:19:19] jesus in the theophany in a form of man
[2:19:23] oh give the lord some praises if you
[2:19:26] didn't know now you know
[2:19:28] before your man was hallelujah
[2:19:33] let's continue then he was actually made
[2:19:36] human flesh
[2:19:37] and dwell among us in the person of
[2:19:39] jesus himself
[2:19:40] born of virgin mary he come in that form
[2:19:43] so he could die
[2:19:45] and went back to heaven now in this last
[2:19:47] days
[2:19:48] he promised to manifest himself in the
[2:19:52] fullness again
[2:19:53] of his flesh in spirit luke 17 30
[2:19:57] even though shall it be in the day
[2:20:01] when the son of man is revealed so this
[2:20:03] malachi for prophet
[2:20:05] was to introduce this luke 17 30 this
[2:20:07] son of man
[2:20:09] and a son of man so what you're hearing
[2:20:12] what has been preached to you is not the
[2:20:15] words of a man
[2:20:17] oh glory to god it's the words of the
[2:20:20] son of man
[2:20:21] okay the lord i shout oh this is
[2:20:24] something to shout about
[2:20:26] this is something to rejoice about
[2:20:28] hallelujah
[2:20:30] let's read this here in the last days he
[2:20:33] has promised to manifest himself
[2:20:35] in the fullness again of his flesh in
[2:20:37] spirit
[2:20:38] for as it wasn't there is a sodom so
[2:20:40] shall it be in the coming of the son of
[2:20:42] man
[2:20:42] now look at the soda how it's set taking
[2:20:44] place
[2:20:45] and jesus being manifested in bodily
[2:20:48] form
[2:20:49] of his church today doing the same thing
[2:20:53] same work same thing he did at that time
[2:20:56] upon the earth today he has manifested
[2:20:58] himself in human bodies
[2:21:00] our human bodies that he has called
[2:21:03] i've done exactly the same thing he done
[2:21:04] in sundry times times of his flesh upon
[2:21:07] the earth doing the same thing today
[2:21:09] because god in sundry time spoke to the
[2:21:12] fathers through the prophets
[2:21:13] in the last day to his son jesus christ
[2:21:15] see the sun
[2:21:17] being revealed in the last days god
[2:21:20] manifested
[2:21:21] in human flesh setting before the sudden
[2:21:24] description
[2:21:25] the end of the gentile world he's talked
[2:21:28] about sudden destruction the end
[2:21:30] of the gentile world god manifested in
[2:21:33] flesh
[2:21:34] so we now just come into church we are
[2:21:36] receiving a message because god
[2:21:39] again was manifested in the flesh
[2:21:42] in this generation in this 20th century
[2:21:47] [Music]
[2:21:48] [Applause]
[2:21:49] [Music]
[2:21:50] now the next thing is when it's all
[2:21:52] gathered up into that one
[2:21:54] person jesus christ bride and body at
[2:21:56] the physical return of the lord jesus
[2:21:59] he when he brought an earth kill
[2:22:00] crucified rays manifest himself in the
[2:22:02] form of body which is a bride
[2:22:04] not the angel is the son of man
[2:22:07] but he is revealing the son of man and
[2:22:10] the very day that the son of man is
[2:22:11] revealed
[2:22:12] revelation 10 1 to 7 read it when you
[2:22:14] get home the seventh angel's message
[2:22:17] open up the seals what is it not the
[2:22:20] angel is the son of man
[2:22:22] but the messenger is revealing the son
[2:22:24] of man can you get it separated now
[2:22:26] that is where it seems to be so hard for
[2:22:28] you not the son of man himself
[2:22:30] but the seven angel the seventh
[2:22:33] messenger is revealing to the public the
[2:22:35] son of man because it left the shock
[2:22:37] he can't organize it it's in the grain
[2:22:41] oh let me hit the home stretch here
[2:22:43] hallelujah

[3:05:20] here
[3:05:21] okay god bless you welcome so happy to
[3:05:23] have you with us
[3:05:24] amen so church as undoubtedly
[3:05:29] we should all be aware uh the prime
[3:05:31] minister announced yesterday
[3:05:33] that the country uh would be
[3:05:37] i guess the world would be restricting
[3:05:39] uh certain things
[3:05:40] it is not a complete lockdown but
[3:05:42] certainly certain things are restricted
[3:05:45] in an effort to i guess flatten the
[3:05:48] curve
[3:05:49] or physical distancing in these things
[3:05:52] and within that
[3:05:53] churches or houses of worship places of
[3:05:56] worship have fallen
[3:05:57] under that category and effective
[3:06:00] tomorrow morning at 6 00 a.m
[3:06:03] we will not be able to meet in the first
[3:06:05] instance for 28 days
[3:06:07] and so we of course would be abiding by
[3:06:10] that
[3:06:11] so as we would have done before we
[3:06:15] opened up again um we would take our
[3:06:18] battle formations
[3:06:19] as we did before and at church say amen
[3:06:22] we have our established group leaders
[3:06:25] and
[3:06:26] we thank god that that has something
[3:06:28] that is operational and
[3:06:29] in place and we'll look over that to
[3:06:32] ensure that we
[3:06:33] are in contact with everybody and you
[3:06:35] certainly have somebody to reach out to
[3:06:37] our services will go uninterrupted uh we
[3:06:40] will of course use technology as we have
[3:06:41] done before

[3:06:45] zoom
[3:06:46] on wednesday night we will have service
[3:06:48] it will be streamed as normal
[3:06:50] and within the constructs of the law
[3:06:53] i think we're allowed i think up to
[3:06:55] maybe a few people
[3:06:57] uh in the building i think a maximum of
[3:06:58] ten so um
[3:07:00] at times we will come a very very small
[3:07:02] group and actually do the service here
[3:07:04] so we can actually preach
[3:07:06] as we would have done before we will
[3:07:07] preach without an audience here and
[3:07:09] you'll have to be shouting in your homes
[3:07:11] and i'll be looking hoping that i can
