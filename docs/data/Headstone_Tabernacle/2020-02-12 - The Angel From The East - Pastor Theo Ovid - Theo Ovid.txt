the captive free father God in the name of Jesus we invite you to have the preeminence is the reason we ask god bless you and welcome it's good to be here this tonight are you have your Bibles I like it turn to Revelation chapter 7 and you want to read 1 2 for Revelation 8 verse 1 1 first year an easy kill chapter 9 we want to read 1 to 6 and read in from revelation chapter 7 says after these things I saw four angels standing on the four corners of the earth holding the four winds of the earth that the wind should not blow on the earth and on the sea nor any tree and I saw another angel ascending from the east having the seal of the Living God they cry aloud for his to the four angels to whom it was given to hurt the earth and the sea saying hurt not the earth neither the sea nor the trees till we have sealed the servants of our God in defiance and I heard the number of them which was sealed and they were sealed 144,000 of all the tribes of the children of Israel revolution eat this one and when he had opened the Seventh Seal There was silence in heaven about his peace of half an hour I won't quote Ezekiel chapter 9 will from verse 1 he cried also in mine ears with a loud voice saying caused them the half charge over the city to draw near even every man with his destroying weapon in his hand and behold the six men came from the way of the high heat which lied towards the north and every man a slaughter weapon in his hand and one man crowed was cluttered with linen with the writers inkhorn by his side and he went and stood beside the brazen altar and the glory of the God of Israel was calling from the cherub funny ones to the threshold of the house and he called to the man clothed with linen which had a writer's ink one by side and the Lord said unto him go through the midst of the city through the midst of Jerusalem and set a mark upon the foreheads of the men that sigh and cry for the abominations that be done in the midst thereof and he unto the others he said in my earring go ye after him through the city and smite let not your eyes spear need a heavy pity slay utterly all and young wood means a little children and women but come not near any man upon whom is the mark and begin at my sanctuary then they began at the ancient men which were before the house may God bless his word you may be seated but tonight is strange what we have to share with you tonight but God is good our title the angel from the east that's the title the angel from the east of a context scripture um Luke chapter 11 are gonna read it out if you want to read it and this is this one Luke chapter 11 and he came the past as he was praying in a certain place when he ceased one of the disciples said unto Him Lord teach us to pray as John also taught his disciples and he said unto them when you pray see our Father which art in heaven hallowed be thy name us worship unto God acknowledge in him his name and thy kingdom come you expect in the kingdom and I will be done in as in heaven so in earth then the requests give us this day my day our daily bread and forgive us our sin what's the condition for we also forgive everyone that is indebted to us and lead us not into temptation but deliver us from evil and he said to them which of you want to get to this which of you have a friend and Charles go on to him at midnight unsealed a.m. friend lend me tree lose for a friend of mine in his journeys come to me I have nothing to set before him and he from within shall answer and said trouble me not the door is now shut and my children are with me in bed I cannot rise and give thee see and I say unto you go listen door he will not rise and give him because he is a friend yet because of his importunity he will rise and give him as many as he needed and that importuning is because of his persistence because of his nagging he will give as many as he needed and then he said this I see on do you ask it shall be given to you seek and you shall find knock it shall be opened unto you for every one that asketh receiveth so you know we put the foot again not now ass kept receiving he that seeketh find it and he that knocketh it shall be opened so he make it clear is not one knock is not one seek is not one ask is ask seek knock it in other words you're keepin on till you get what you have neither because that friend is not a friend is not gonna come off from his bed because he's a friend he's gonna come up because they are a sin that person I have nothing to set before me like that family and I have or that guest that I have I need help I need some bread could you kill me that bread of course I know you're tired I know you had a hard day's work but my friend come from overseas and I have nothing all the stores are closed the restaurants are closed and no you have bread inside the day I by the bakery you can't tell me to have no bread you have bread inside the deer don't lie you have bread inside a deer bring it out I need it I cannot move it I stay in here you can meet me any morning Oh glory to God your hair as in them or glories of Jesus put that parable to give you an idea of your attitude of your persistence of your importunity well glory to God who says Jesus my friend no no no no you have something I need you have something you want you have something I've got to have Oh glory to God hallelujah he has a Mac he have a seal he have a baptism of the Holy Ghost you have a promise for you Oh glory to God and to your children and the temple afar off even as many as a lot of a God shall call he have an experience for you he have a fire for you he has a powerful you do you want it Oh blow it up God know what Jesus is back running this he said he give the all-father prayer I forgive us as we forgive those who trespass against us and then he give this parable about a man of a long a journey a long journey come to see I have nothing to set before me describe this scenario then a friend of mine is journey a long journey come to me I have nothing set before him and then the persistence and any command said well this is the attitude no he's breaking it on ask it shall be given to you and seek and ye shall find a knock she'll be open to you and to the lazy people who say they went and knock and nobody opened the door and they asked and they didn't get and they seek and didn't find he answer all that lazy behavior he come down with the next level here in that ask at him that knocketh him that seeketh not him that not oh god you're lazy that's why you're not not yet you're not knocking enough hallelujah not seeking enough yeah well I pray no no no yes seeking enough you're not seeking you have to see no there's a reason why I'm reading this because he had a next line here if a son shall ask bread of any of you disease of father will he give him a stone if he ask a fish will he for fish give him a sip and if he asks for an egg will you give him a famous copier then he said this if ye then being evil know how to give good gifts unto your children how much more shall your heavenly Father give the Holy Spirit to them that ask him to them to them that check the passing on to death that come and sitting in church and listened and read the word no to them that so this is personal to them that ask him so you give me hold back wrong to show you what is happening and why is the foolish version will remain foolish and while the wise version will be made wise because the wise not taking nothing for granted the wines have extra oil and there's a reason why the wise have extra oil and the foolish oil ran out the Hat you know yes they had a portion you know yes they had the atmosphere they had it but what they had ran out or dried out hallelujah but this wise version she going to ask she's going to receive many others just talking the talk this wise version going to walk that talk or glory to God hallelujah glory to God is at Pune bed one taken one left make sure you are the one that's taken that's an individual affair you have to see it Oh glory to God Amen let's continue you saw my question nan says Mr Bowen dong he said to me I couldn't read a revelation there was a bride standing on the Hmong Sinai there's a bride up yonder he said there was a bride and the water and the Dragons within water is mode to make war with her I said Mr Bowen the first thing of it is you got the wrong thing calling it the brine I said the Jews will stand on Mount Sinai the hundred and forty-four thousand the bride correctly was in heaven with Jesus on the dragon that splitted water out of his mouth will make war with the remnant of the woman's seed that was this group here that had to go down the remnant of the woman's seed on his describing it the sanctified Church without receiving the Holy Ghost that's the ones who make war with that's the people belong just and oppressed here and any message and the sister can clean and they believe God sent a prophet and then it just yes this sanctified they have the box they listen to the tapes but they don't have the oil they have nice ministers nice pastors nice elders nice deacons but when that time comes God not asking for who's the pasta who's the elder who is the deacon when that time come when that time comes God send them angels he said go her glory to God one angel was in the myths he had a king corn

put a mark upon them Oh glory of God hallelujah hallelujah the others are coming the others the other angels are coming but the same angel with the ink one writer same angel is the angel from the east having the seal of the Living God a hundred and forty-four thousand was sealed that was the Jews but before they are sealed there's a Gentile bride to be sealed and that's where you come in or chlorine of God no matter putting a mark upon you no manner controlling the smack it's the angel from the east that has the seal well glory to God I believe that angel it's going to move yet tonight I am on an expectation for the Rangers are coming up tonight to put a mass hallelujah there is going to be a bride that's gonna be sealed by the truth the Holy Ghost hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah or

when it broke it was silence only for half an hour but once that silence is broken everything's have to be me effect God have you honor covering what have your honor what have you under something or in the time of the revelation of these things being made known but once it's completed it's time for the dynamics it's time for the Holy Ghost it's time for the angel from these folklore eat up God

sanctified that refused to get the Holy Ghost the church were persecute and and the Roman Church will persecute them but the bride is already raptured and in heaven there they are please exactly so the hundred and forty-four thousand are Jews God's servant and when the Holy Ghost has preached to them they receive the baptism of the Holy Ghost just exactly like they did in the beginning the Gentile dispensation is finished the church is seal away the rapture comes so them Jews can't get no Holy Ghost until this bag get the Holy Ghost or get the Lord a shout because the coming of the

time just a few to pull like that to get into the kingdom of God notice his words not get the church get into the kingdom of God the doors are closing then the next thing the Jews has got to receive the Holy Ghost and be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ along they were pushed it made fun of and as soon as the Holy Ghost is represent presented to them they receive the baptism of the Holy Ghost the Gentile church is raptured and those who refuse just walked under just a fiction the dragon druman powers puts the water which will unite with communism and take the church into position like that then the gospel goes back to the Jews right there at that time then there will be a revival among those huge right there that will carry thousands and tens stoves 144,000 is the kingdom God will be sealed by the ceilin angel so the angel from the east is the ceiling you mean where over there's a c-major yes I mean you don't hear about that any message you hear about pasta angel and apostle angel and evangelist angel and and until a shallow container but what would this in Julia what what is one here this is silly ninja enough enough in if I fall forget the Lord a shout of feeling good tonight this Ames have not any fight for this angel from the east is not an if I fall this the angel from the east who God calling the seal manger don't forget them tonight hallelujah is a silly angel and he have a mission to see you he's coming to put a smack upon you or glory to God you believe that do you believe that are usually an expectation that a hundred and forty-four thousand into the kingdom of God will be sealed by the seven angel I trust that he is coming from the east and that's the way he is from now on with the ceiling as an I want to be guarded in the air I have sent a persecution near all right and I've got all the 144,000 standing there that's gonna receive the bat Holy Ghost and right there as soon as that's that ceiling angel begins to seal the hundred four thousand the Gentiles door is closed so anytime them set against each other is over close and the Jew secure Holy Ghost reduce the revulsion and they will have a revulsion the entire world and the power of God will be manifested among the Jews power of God all right so what the Holy Ghost is it is your assurance it's your protection it's your witness it's your seal it's you're saying I'm heaven bound don't care what the devil see I'm heaven bound why he sealed me he give it to me his cement his kingdom I am glory bum let the winds blow let's see it under what he wants but don't see me till the day of my Redemption that is what the Holy Ghost is you should want it I couldn't go on without it Oh glory to God hallelujah diddly that now this church is the message is being poured into the church this is after Shepherd she sits as a shepherd dream was a vision of a man with water and point the only water leaking out then he take our big bucket of honey and pour it into this big rock box and it held and he said the Holy Ghost that represented the Holy Ghost in the church no church could hold it whoa let's go now and about a honey the church could hold the honey square to forgiveness all right watch in this church is a message being poured into the church but the church but in itself here we go this Tabernacle we will see that's where she comes to church this tabernacle is not a Holy Ghost Tabernacle there is no such a thing the Holy Ghost in okay individuals that come in to discharge his Holy Ghost tabernacle they are the Tabernacles that contain the Holy Ghost but not the church in a body or group so that's why nobody could say here is it Jesus has already he said when they say look here go follow them look here come here that is not yet he said behold the kingdom is within you come on come on are we got to me since you're off key all that kind of Revelation is it look nice is so good and so on but it off it's not the word the Holy Ghost is poured out on individuals give the Lord a shout on that but Abraham should we speak in tongues absolutely that's gifts of God but those gifts of God with all these virtues in them makes it a stumbling block to the unbeliever it's not accepted by God this rock mud if you choose now has to be first and when you have faith and virtue and knowledge and temperance and patience and coordination but love then the Holy Ghost comes down and seals you as a unit the same as he sees the church ages as a unit so the church ages has to be sealed as a unit hallelujah hallelujah and the individual has to be seen as a unit so them seven things had to be in you then Duncan the Holy Ghost and seen the whole Beldon love seal all the virtues in that Nunley coat he said be cook a little patience they can leak out temperance you can leak out this and Rico that but when that holy was come and seal the whole thing you become a sealed unit of the Lord God Oh glory with a mark on you with an address with a destination grieve not the Holy Spirit whereby you are sealed until the day of your Redemption glory to God God put that mark and said redeemed Oh glory to God a redeemed son he picked you off [Applause] let's continue then the holy ghost come down and ceaseless unit the same as he seen the church is the unit the way he mixed the way he makes his bride okay the way he makes his bride is the way he makes this individual made out of the same material like Eve was made out of Adam a rib from his side he has the things that you have to have faith here we go you can't impersonate them god bless you Brenda sweetie sweetie spirit somebody who take too much of sweets like something an amount ice talking nights adversity duty katsu and cap on me when you said it was so same yum-yum change them yeah you know the real thing commode see so you see cannot imprison ate it he said you can't imitate them they gotta be caught sent and caught born two important was caught sent caught born imitation only country causes confusion to be taken a lot more listen to this he's praying in the second Lord he said look let us pray he said blessed heavenly father tonight at the beginning of this revival as our time I wrapped up now on a little pass I pretty to be merciful to these people and grant Almighty God here tonight at least twenty hands went up in the building that I needed Christ Oh God it's their souls just stare at the oil the oil is just about burnt out there won't be much more when the last drop is gone from the bucket or the cantina there will be no more oil put in lamps they realize that the in the last day there is not a hope on earth for us outside of Christ and I pray tonight Lord that some in the Sun honest of this moment that's some Lemna tea that you will know some the holy spirit and make them raise your hands and see them from a life of sin granted father he's talking about that bucket when the last drop is gone from the bucket or the container there'll be no more oil to put in their lamps so maybe you'll leave it with that song give me oil in my mouth to keep me burning give me oil in mine all right give me oil in my lamp keep me burning keep me burning till the break of day the pass that I give me oil to keep me burning the Deacon can't give me oil in my lab then every pass that I give you and he didn't give you on the way you look at the info for the oil that you need Oh God may the court put a boot in your heart to pray to ask to knock to seek Oh glory to God free to ask to knock the seat Oh glory to God you have to go beyond the letter of the word people trained on for years so sit down and just hear minister preach and teach and unfold and reveal and undone reveal this and see this and said that's what they're trained to that have to change you have to come with a

is brother Brennan when the enemy come like a flood I'll read the Sun up against it that's right and the church has taken a stand and mean the Holy Ghost Church and that is what I'm interested in friends when I'm here oh dear I'll pray for the sick but in here I'm interested in one thing that is God's born-again church that is what I'm interested in anyhow I am NOT interested in bylaws Deacons and so forth like that orders of churches I'm interested in the baptism of the Holy Ghost upon the church for this day that we are living in go get the Lord and show the Lord a show hallelujah not by laws or glory to God but the Holy Ghost upon the church the Holy Ghost upon you the Holy Ghost I come upon you okay the Lord comes upon you has to come upon you Oh glory to God you may be seated [Applause] [Music] when Jesus was walking with them pizza and all I'm can say I have the Holy Ghost because they all goes with them even chooses to kill them he says I will not leave you comfortless come when I was with you but shall be in you so what was with them had to come in them let me say it again because the dynamics is yet power is here everything you see here up to you see everything present tense God is here everything is here but that to be translated Jesus had was a recently dead give them clarity of understanding by open understanding open the seals of the Old Testament to them the word they had the understanding open they would an open don't know what they had to get he didn't give them the understanding the educate them enough no more any Pharisees that was it was it was revelation that they could come under expectation for their manifestation so when God identified with stammering lips and another tongue identify Jewish Scripture shall come to pass support my spirit jesus taught descriptors to them he was reading the courts he was bringing an Old Testament prophecy and said this is what have to come that's why when Peter come he said this is that because Jesus showed in that that the Prophet joy speak of peace our could identify this manifestation is because of this prophecy here when Jesus overcome Satan in the wilderness and he came to the chamber what did Jesus do he find the place where it was written he found his scriptures and he said his prayers upon me and they thought he was just reading scripture then he said this this good job is fulfilling your ears so Jesus thought was to find his scripture to identify himself with the bride has to find her scriptures to identify yourself with we are not going to identify with foolish virgins remnant of the woman's seed revolution since we not identify with that I call them jubilation since let's continue there are two types of Christianity's seem strange I would not say two different types I say two different phases will be a better word to use not two types two phases simcha sanity but two phases of it one of them is an intellectual or mental conception of what God has said in his word and of Jesus Christ by way of knowledge and the other is an experimental experience that God has given the man in his heart and ported them going to church but I don't believe the message water and her books and tips but one have an experimental experience here and the other one of a head thing missing services oh give the loss embraces intellectually is hunger in one he's feasting on God his feet doesn't hole oh the other one seems that the vichy all the time nothing butters them they're just a solid and anchor as they can be no trials no stones bother them at all but they seem to have something about them the people who are Christians trying to live for God admire that type of Christian and I often wondered Lord what is it that these people have that the others create so much for oh my hallelujah something is in the heart same aside shells in manager no but something is near heart he's a denied Christ Peter run away Pittacus but something happened in his heart in the upper room that devil got kicked told his snake got fire bombed and God sat down on the Troon of his hat and Peter was a changed man same picture they take a picture of him on Instagram is the same but a Peter same face him tears in everything but he had change Oh glory to God somebody else inside of that man Oh glory to God His Holy Ghost and fire inside of that man it proved it man and NASA Sapphira came lying in the church it come out of him it's a power it's a hidden power it comes on as we might need Peter was looking to give the man money at the gate called beautiful he had no money but he only remembered what he had he had two selves and olha like number what I have I can give you man well or I could give you that thing what I have will glory rise up and walk in the name of Jesus Christ because I am now connected to the source itself or glava source in me other power in me I'm an efficient well in me or guy at my auntie and tech or glory to glory I'm connected director diviner I am a branch and apart from divine flow through me as my father send me Jesus I saw Sunday oh he was a powerhouse he was connected to the very source itself all glory to God so the Spirit of God was flowing through the line she led branch to whosoever will or give the Lord a shout this is what God one for you [Applause] Bessy prophet look in the second chapter of Joshua find out here that I believe in harlot named Rahab Gentile Hallett across the river and when they come into the Promised Land the spies went over the spout all of our family was safe under the token now remember listen God's destroying angel on earth at talking and when the churches went down the mayor fell the city went down the king went down the governor the educated the pretty woman the handsome man the important all-sufficient everything went down that wasn't under the token so will it be in the coming of the Son of God his destroying angel will destroy everything who hasn't got the token of the baptism of the Holy Ghost upon them to show that you are being identified and guide yourself to your sacrifice and are born into the Spirit of God and seal there by the Holy Ghost a cadet born and they're sealed in there by the Holy Ghost oh my do believe that and in the last days they're the only two kinds of people two classes of people then that has the seal and the others that will have the mark of the beast so the seed of God is the Baptist of the Holy Spirit and the mark of the beast is not a stamp on your hand the mark of the beast is rejecting the seal of God you take the mark of the beast the first thing you know the time will come when you will be God will give a message that and you will be sealed in or seal all the kingdom of God oh my I wonder if that time is really a fresh message a fresh prophecy of the prophecy Oh hallelujah prophecy a message of the seed of God Oh hallelujah oh my I read it again the time will come when you quad will give a message who will give a message God will give a message and what the percentage changes he said one he said the world will hear from God once more he left off more himself now he's dumb but the spirit and the brand the Prophet will say the same thing and what the same will have already been said in the world once more the world will hear it from God how will you know it's the voice of God it will be a manifestation of the prophets world that is how you're gonna know the voice of God not I explained this that we in this new a manifest this is that that the Prophet William Branham speak of or give the Lord a shout in other words here is a seventh on the revival this is that that the Prophet said that there will come a time when people find them everywhere to see the seven thunders being manifested this is that that the Prophet take of the bride had no revival yet it will take them seven thunders to wake up the bride again there has been no manifestation of God just still the bride he will send it there we opposite this is that that the Prophet said look he's in it look at here or give the Lord a shout glory to God hallelujah identifying what the prophet prophecy is Oh glory to God because when you take the book from the angel the only prophesy according to the book you can't have your own prophecy give the Lord a praise I think I want to see that again the voice that John good means you take the book and almost prophesy again how do I say well you know what I go to meet the prophesied this and prophesied that he's just in the book the words in his mouth he has to speak from the prophecy of the book prophesied the nation to tongue to Kings that Micah go any part of this world and prophesy oh yes we could prophesy two kings and portentous and countries and nations or glory and prophesy to the bright room until a church member bkerr prophesied judgment to the church and delivers a redemption to the bride we could prophesy deliverance for your family we could prophesy the times front of the Jubilee of the grace of God Queen oh dear loved ones the spirit of the bride say come or glory deliver after that closing time is Judgment to declare the day of vengeance of our God let's continue quickly there brother if you have them if you haven't got the bathroom all he goes this morning run into the kingdom of God as quick as you can the ceilin time is on one day I'll have a message that title the sicilian time is on oh what a time he prophesized the time of the revelation of these things being made known come and dine elbows he prophesied there's a long time 50-plus years of the revelation of these things being made known this message on books and Tifa to go in all languages all the world how to have a period of time God is you under control in time because it's a time and season for everything under heaven we could want this and want that but if God has any time is not yet it's not yet sometimes God have a lingering time Moses gotta be in a manner an action but guacho 40-plus years the true Moses in the wilderness to give him some time to the big coat and right mode and get ready to go back to Egypt Oh glory to God as much as the people want to deliverance data wait until movie was ready well glory to God because Moosa was immature and he didn't have the mindset yet he never met the pillar fire yet he wasn't activated yet he was just intellectual Oh glory I'll cover the knowledge of the word of what he was supposed to do but until the fire come heat I'll go on Commission because I feed and let the world the Egypt but no power with terrible a cup Sara will lick you up you can't go down there with no power first man that died Moses just busted off the tongue run straight out and take a 40 years vacation and after that God's the time up I had because my people attend the call this man this man cool cool cool seen what sheep and goat and buying furniture or anything like that we actually relax relax go see this this is the Kiowa till a fire come and drop down there Moses walking down Rama II see fire and he said with this bodies in the Berlin I gotta see this thing he gone with camera to take pictures say you go and put that on Facebook when he hit so God said take off your shoes recognizes a different experience or they get a fire stick that man transformed that man when he going on their wife asked him when you're going to said to Egypt he said to take over it's a five minutes all this long long long weary no sermons five minutes in the presence of that pillar fire taught Moses more than the 40 years or how much years in Egypt five minutes and what we need we need are five minutes I've already message this is not two hours that four hours five minutes everything changes all Waker overcome or Lavinia fight and you can stop this unsub that five minutes decide - not in my presence at all and the presence of the pillar fire just life just five minutes at that John fellows one dead Daniel fellows dead but of animals packed in a corner numb for girls he said nobody blessings but your tone about the power who give the Lord a shout excitement just just five minutes dice the games thanks the playing Church this is five minutes in the press of the purifier like completely change and transform or glory no clock no wonder why Peter was tough what's what's believe I upside on after that fire coming say that and they don't care no more they beat them under still time to church they are prideful sick leave and stay home Wednesday night come to church understand Lord God send back power that we could go back oh dear and they worry filled with the Holy Ghost he said the dynamics of this church will be a refilling of the Holy Ghost a better sister if you haven't got the back lawn he goes this morning rather to the kingdom of God as quick as you can thus even time is on the enemy come like a flood he's raising the standard against that the drama is set the church is going home just as certain as anything see you haven't got to wait long with the wheat friend you haven't got all the time to hurt he said did you realize Christian friends that the Antichrist which is the mark of the beast Antichrist anyone knows that the Antichrist his mark is a mark of power you see a piece is a power there's a power of the Catholic Church there's a power of the Methodist Church the power message that's the beast power the Baptist Church the same Carmelite Lutheran all of them Pentecostal is bad but grieve not the Holy Spirit Ephesians 4:30 wherever you are sealed until the redemption now what does Eden mean season is a sign of completion so why would God put the seal and you're not completed see you she'll see what seal what is finished see what is completed so God put in a map by the wood on you to fill you with the Holy Ghost Oh hallelujah now to explain that part listen to the reference but a ban on Nick you saw Jesus made a reference I body the man that came late and I went in eben acts for Low's and they went right don't see record give the Holy Ghost they would ask him he do all at that but I can lead to bring don't just show that you have to activate him listen the bottom an unknown he said well you did you ever see a real rude alluding the cars these will be cars he will go out and will set so much there and so much there then the inspector comes back and looks in and if this a little loose it's six nope I won't seal it gotta tear it out and do it over again next thing you had tried to learn it again he will get this one wrong he's become back wrong do it again that is what God has been doing with this church for a long time you load up and you're going to heaven you're taking everything with you your card games every other thing you can load into the church you're trying to take with you God just condemns it you ain't ready for Ceylon but when God sees a man contrite you don't hear what I would no more broken spirit sincere heart don't let the altar you do see that no more nobody's in the altar no God closes the door to the world to him and seals in India by the baptism of the Holy Ghost and it lasts until Jesus come I am a pitch and Pentecostal I am preaching the Holy Ghost which is what is God promised it has nothing to do with their Pentecostal church we're not talking about that or glory to God God didn't kick out justification because I profit come he didn't call significant because the profit come you need justification you need sanctification you need a bath only ghost and immediate word okay the Lord a shout let me say that again not because the Prophet come you dismiss everything else when that box car doors closed and the government see this put on it it cannot be opened no more until which is finally the destination he said now when a greenery falls on the earth no matter if that green abhi dice itself it can't produce a possible to save its soul a greener wheat will bring forth a green or wheat and the Holy Spirit leading the church leads it in the power of the resurrection of Jesus Christ that's when Holy Ghost leaden Oh glory to God so but of it the Holy Ghost is the power exactly the Bible is a road map the road map the power seat takes you there Oh glory to God power to do what reproduce he promised anything power comes at the shake on this for long it's the produced he promised power come to identify the promise when power come upon Jesus the Bible said he returned in the power of the Spirit and then in the power of the Spirit scripture what was promised the Spirit is upon me because he has anointed me Oh glory to God that was the promise of the hour he identified with it and the power to shew the channel of that prophecy and there's a put the manifest these are the Messiah or give the Lord a shout India was this commission under bright commission to be creatively of vengeance of our God to finish the Commission Oh hallelujah praise the Lord amen oh I love him he said no when you hit a bone you're the trouble chicken a week it's really blown away so if a prisoner I've appreciated hit a bone see the bone just put it bonus fact you eatin cherry pie you're under siege in actually pea we just truly Siddalee so you do the same thing in listen to this I believe the reason there is so much confusion today about the Holy Spirit it is not correctly taught I believe the baptism is taught and just said baptism but when you say automobile no I've got several mechanics in the church I don't know one thing about it so if I make a mistake is I'm another mechanic they are coils plugs points vowels everything else that makes an automobile so when you talk about baptism of the Holy Spirit there's a lot that goes with that so you can all the experience and says you're one do one with on transition position I want to feel nothing I want to move you come from a Methodist I know in some holiness people anything they say I mean yeah I'm talk about somebody when teaching about hallelujah some some fiery Holy Ghost keep sister and everybody acoustic look to my but just how do you do that twice and if every nectar in bath or do you want to leave after Anna because you don't very comfortable because formal spritzer with spiritual this equal informal fanatics spirit fanatic do you know but have formal one to tell me one stiff before the ominous which is really does understeer they see their name on the book but it's not doing what John do I thought John Sutter dance and shout and praise go because I see the mail and the name on the book I do see the name on the book like that what God put my name on a book and I can't praise and worship God I cap bless god I can't value the love of God yeah yeah yeah born in sin Shiva Liberty the grace of God come and take my over the Catholic I was any pizza room go ahead to put extra materials to get me a little extra angel extra power come Monday it's not easy conversion room that's locked Catania the deliverance accommodation if you're more than eight your father Mitch of everybody in it will even go in when I caught the whole family might but boy you don't enjoy you don't want freedom I was glad the whole family man no one by one game baptized in Jesus name then we'll get glad to it will give you choice because one son crossover or glory and God will rejoice when you cross over to my mind now watch he still no Peter said faith now watch it not reclose we're gonna teach this for few minutes feet now and act your faith virtue and virtue knowledge knowledge temperance temperance patience to patience godliness God miss brotherly love very loved and loved anyone knows that love is God no then then that then that brings us into seven church ages God is building seven inches a Bride of Christ to Philadelphia tight area and so on like that right he said then they watch and if the bridegroom awake in the first watch of the seventh watch all these visions are weak they awoke the virgins of Ephesus Smyrna Pergamum Thyatira Sardis Philadelphia Odisha did you notice that it was the seventh age when he came woke up the sleeping virgin that bring them all the way back down to there but in this to the years ages he has built a bride born a bride begotten a bridal earth for Christ and the same way he baguettes this bride he has to be God individuals so the bride was was formed to seven ages so therefore he is seen the individuals have to be formed to seven steps okay now let me hear what I'm back drawing in this you know he says no these things form elevators here absolutely must be in the Christian before the Holy Ghost ever sees them before this comes down on top and makes a complete unit these things have to be in hallelujah I'm gonna finish Gideon this Omniguide he said a reason the common of the seals at the finishing of the seventh seal the mystery of God shall be finished to know who bought is what he is how he lives his nature his being you supposed to be all the way up there by that time and that brings us the full stature of sons and daughters of God a church as washing the blood that's bottled money not at the start at the finishing of the seventh seal we supposed to be we up dear right David brotherly kindness right there with the spirit of forgiveness right there with that sweet and knowing to man the woman come to for nine months she's pregnant come before nine months and that sweet spirit come
