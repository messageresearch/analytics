[9:39] tonight
[9:40] and um it seems my luck
[9:44] to speak to you tonight and to share
[9:46] some of you tonight and i'm grateful
[9:48] i consider it as an honor and privilege
[9:50] to just share the word
[9:53] and to speak to you you know um
[9:59] today and we and i got our first dose of
[10:02] the
[10:03] cyanopharm vaccine today
[10:07] we got vaccinated and um
[10:11] the title that i have tonight of
[10:15] what i want to share with you is
[10:18] have you been inoculated it's the title
[10:22] that i have tonight so just listen you
[10:24] know up front
[10:25] and um you know i wanted to answer the
[10:29] question
[10:30] of whether or not we should take the
[10:32] inoculation
[10:34] and um i'll take the vaccine
[10:37] with a testimony of having actually
[10:40] received it
[10:41] and they want to talk about it before
[10:44] actually having received it myself
[10:46] so um we did so today amir and i
[10:50] and um up to yesterday
[10:54] i heard about people in this message
[10:57] talking about
[10:58] this being the mark of the beast and i
[11:01] really find that to be
[11:03] fearful foolish what i call conspiracy
[11:06] theory revolution
[11:08] now i i'm not one who goes with
[11:12] all what on facebook and all the people
[11:14] seeing and all the
[11:15] sharing and forwards and stuff as to is
[11:18] this is that and the other
[11:20] i really um not one
[11:23] uh to go dear what i can see
[11:27] is that i believe israel now
[11:30] is about over 60 percent fully
[11:32] vaccinated
[11:34] in israel the thing about it is the
[11:36] pandemic
[11:37] it's not an epidemic it's not a local
[11:39] thing it's something that is
[11:40] international
[11:42] it's around the world israel who
[11:45] is surrounded by enemies know that they
[11:48] can't risk
[11:49] their country just falling apart or just
[11:52] crashing like that as such they i think
[11:55] one of the top ones who
[11:57] you know have really been successful in
[12:00] the attempts to
[12:01] curb this virus this pandemic
[12:04] and i believe and i've been people have
[12:06] been asking
[12:07] should i take it and whatnot i can't say
[12:09] that i
[12:10] i'm not going to tell you do not take it
[12:12] i'm not going to peddle that
[12:14] um you know what and um somebody say you
[12:17] know
[12:18] as a man say it's going to change your
[12:20] dna and all kind of thing these
[12:22] these people they're not scientists
[12:24] they're not doctors
[12:26] but they have a lot of opinions and
[12:28] stuff and things like that
[12:29] but i believe that you are more at risk
[12:32] being unvaccinated than being
[12:34] vaccinated and i want to say tonight
[12:38] the devil trades in debt that's his
[12:41] currency anything connected to the enemy
[12:45] is dead if he could
[12:48] cut your life short he would
[12:52] if he gets an opportunity to remove you
[12:55] off the face of this hood he would
[12:58] because your life and testimony as a
[13:01] christian
[13:02] is a threat to his kingdom
[13:05] you have the ability to win others
[13:09] you have the ability to snatch souls out
[13:12] of unrighteousness
[13:13] and darkness into this glorious light
[13:17] and you know i was telling my wife so
[13:19] i'm so funny so if taking the vaccine is
[13:21] taking the mark of the beast well if you
[13:23] die
[13:23] you can't by yourself it's very
[13:25] interesting you know if you
[13:27] take it and you die you really care by
[13:29] yourself but the bible says
[13:31] the devil received all except those
[13:33] names are not written
[13:35] and you have to believe tonight that
[13:38] your name is on that book your name
[13:42] is written and god gonna keep you safe
[13:44] and some
[13:48] are you hearing me know sorry about that
[13:49] but that was
[13:51] that was um a small clip concerning
[13:54] the origination of this so-called
[13:56] vaccination
[13:57] and when smallpox um attacked europe and
[14:00] so on
[14:01] many people were dying and everything
[14:02] else and they discovered the maids who
[14:04] were milking cows
[14:06] they did not it was not affecting them
[14:08] and then scientists discovered
[14:10] that cold pox they had called pox small
[14:13] blues in their skin and so on
[14:14] but the the the other box wasn't
[14:17] affecting them smallpox wasn't affecting
[14:18] them
[14:19] so what they did they take some of the
[14:22] callpox from these maids hands and so on
[14:24] like that
[14:25] and they create this thing and they
[14:27] injected it into somebody who was
[14:29] healthy
[14:30] and they produced antibodies and so on
[14:31] and that would vaccine
[14:33] come from vacca which is called and so
[14:34] on this whole the brute of this thing
[14:36] called vaccine
[14:37] and um and it's very interesting i was
[14:40] thinking about
[14:41] what did jesus do how did jesus do
[14:44] things and so on and
[14:45] and uh then this scripture this
[14:48] particular scripture
[14:50] maybe i could find it i could read it in
[14:53] john chapter nine so we can find it for
[14:56] you
[15:00] and jesus passed by and he saw a man
[15:02] which was blind from his birth
[15:04] and the disciples asked him saying
[15:06] master who did sin
[15:07] this man or his parents that he was born
[15:10] dying
[15:11] jesus answered saying neither had this
[15:12] man sinned nor his parents
[15:15] but at the works of god should be made
[15:17] manifest in him
[15:18] i must work the works of him that sent
[15:21] me
[15:21] while it is day the night comment
[15:24] no man can work as long as i'm in the
[15:27] world i am the light of the world
[15:29] and when he had dust spoken he spat on
[15:32] the ground
[15:33] made clay out of spittle and he anointed
[15:37] the eyes of the blind man with the clay
[15:39] and said unto him go
[15:41] wash in the pool of siloam which is by
[15:45] interpretation
[15:45] sent and he went his way therefore and
[15:48] washed and came seeing
[15:50] the neighbors therefore and they which
[15:52] before had seen him that was blind your
[15:54] blind said
[15:55] it's not he that sat and begged and some
[15:58] said this is he
[15:59] other said he is like him but he said i
[16:01] am he
[16:03] therefore it is said unto him how would
[16:05] thine eyes open
[16:06] and he answered and said a man that is
[16:08] called jesus
[16:09] made take me clean and anointed mine
[16:12] eyes
[16:13] and said unto me go to the pool of
[16:16] siloam
[16:16] and wash and i went and washed and i
[16:19] received sight
[16:21] and then said they unto him where is he
[16:23] he said i know not
[16:24] they brought him to the pharisees him
[16:26] that before time was blind
[16:28] it was a sabbath day and when jesus made
[16:30] the claim
[16:31] and opened his eyes then again the
[16:33] pharisees also asked him
[16:34] how he had received his sight he said
[16:37] unto him he put clay upon my eyes and i
[16:39] wash
[16:40] and i do see therefore said some of the
[16:42] pharisees this man is not of god
[16:44] because he keep it not the sabbath day
[16:46] but has said how can a man that is a
[16:49] sinner
[16:49] do such miracles and there was a
[16:51] division among them
[16:52] they say unto the blind man again what
[16:55] sees though of him
[16:56] that he opened up thine eyes he said
[16:58] he's a prophet but the jews did not
[17:00] believe concerning him
[17:01] that he had been blind and received his
[17:03] sight until they called his parents of
[17:05] him
[17:05] that had received his sight and they
[17:07] asked them saying is this your son
[17:10] who you say was born blind how then does
[17:12] he
[17:13] see his parents answered them and said
[17:15] we know not
[17:16] this is our son that he is was born
[17:18] black but by what means he's now see it
[17:21] we know not
[17:22] or who had opened his eyes we know not
[17:24] he's of age ask him
[17:26] he shall speak for himself these words
[17:28] speak his parents because they fear the
[17:30] jews for the jews
[17:31] that agreed already agreed already that
[17:34] if any man did confess
[17:36] that he was christ he would be put out
[17:38] of the synagogue
[17:39] therefore said his parents he's of age
[17:41] ask him then again
[17:43] called they again called the man that
[17:45] was blind
[17:46] and said unto him give god praise we
[17:48] know that this man is a sinner
[17:49] he answered and said whether he's a
[17:51] sinner or not i know not
[17:52] one thing i know that whereas i was
[17:55] blind no i see
[17:56] then said they unto him again what did
[17:58] he do today how old me than eyes he
[18:00] answered and said
[18:01] i have told you already and you did not
[18:04] hear
[18:05] wherefore would ye hear it again will
[18:07] you also be disciples
[18:09] and they reviled him and said thou art
[18:11] his disciples
[18:12] but we are moses disciples we know that
[18:14] god speak unto moses
[18:15] for as for this fellow we know not from
[18:18] whence he is
[18:19] the man answered and said unto them why
[18:22] hearing his marvelous thing
[18:23] that he knew not from whence he is and
[18:25] yet he had opened mind eyes
[18:27] and now we know that god hear it not
[18:30] sinners
[18:30] but if any man be a worshiper of god and
[18:33] do it his will
[18:34] him he hear it and since the world began
[18:37] was it not heard that any man
[18:39] opened the eyes of one that was born
[18:41] blind and if this man were not of god he
[18:44] could do nothing
[18:45] they answered and said unto him there
[18:47] was altogether born in sins
[18:49] look at the attitude here he says that
[18:51] this man if this man was not of god
[18:54] he could do nothing he answered and said
[18:56] unto him though was
[18:57] altogether born in sin and don't teach
[19:00] us and they cast him out
[19:02] and jesus heard that they cast him out
[19:05] and when he had found him
[19:06] he said unto him does thou believe on
[19:08] the son of god he answered and said who
[19:10] is he lord that i might believe on him
[19:12] and jesus said unto him though has been
[19:15] seen him
[19:16] and it is he that talketh with thee and
[19:18] he said lord
[19:19] i believe and you worship him and
[19:22] jesus said for judgment
[19:26] i am come unto this world that they
[19:29] might
[19:29] that they would see might not see and
[19:32] they which
[19:33] see might be made blind and some of the
[19:36] pharisees which were with him heard
[19:38] these words
[19:39] and said unto him are we blind also
[19:42] and jesus said unto them if you were
[19:44] blind
[19:45] you would have no sin but now you say we
[19:48] see
[19:48] therefore your sin remain what does
[19:50] scripture may god bless
[19:52] his word tonight and jesus boss them
[19:54] good and proper he
[19:55] say if only all you're blind you know
[19:58] sin but if all you say you see
[20:00] i'll catch you right there because you
[20:01] see it for yourself now
[20:04] i read that scripture to show you that
[20:06] jesus didn't just by spirit
[20:09] be healed we see no he spit
[20:12] on the ground he mixed clay
[20:15] plies in the man eyes and tell him go
[20:17] and wash he take what was dear
[20:19] and made something out of it and the man
[20:21] had to just go and
[20:22] apply it wash at the sea uh they pull up
[20:26] a salon and then he was made whole and
[20:29] god
[20:31] and god and god bless them amen praise
[20:34] the lord
[20:35] blessed be the name of the lord so trust
[20:36] tonight by god's grace that you
[20:39] uh edified that are edified by this
[20:41] tonight so let me say it again
[20:43] that i believe you are greater at risk
[20:45] being unvaccinated than being vaccinated
[20:50] and satan trades in debt that is what he
[20:53] treats him
[20:54] because that is his cut-off point that
[20:56] is as far as he could go he can't really
[20:58] go beyond debt
[20:59] and this is where the inoculation of the
[21:02] gospel comes in
[21:03] and the inoculation of the power of the
[21:06] gospel comes in
[21:07] that we can know that he could raise us
[21:08] from the dead and the grave have no
[21:10] victory
[21:11] over the blood watchman so we thank god
[21:13] throughout the night
[21:14] so how many of you were blessed by
[21:16] sunday service
[21:17] uh obedience is better than sacrifice
[21:20] and um
[21:21] i was i was sharing with a brother today
[21:25] about you know
[21:29] when god tell you to do something that's
[21:31] what god wanted
[21:32] you could go on fast and pray for 10
[21:34] days 20 days whatever
[21:36] but until they come back to obey what
[21:38] god said if that god said make these
[21:39] things right
[21:40] and you know you have to make that right
[21:43] and the issue
[21:44] here was that the instruction given to
[21:47] saul
[21:47] to saul was to kill everything
[21:50] and yet he claimed that this here kept
[21:53] his side
[21:53] was to offer unto the lord and samuel
[21:56] tell him since when
[21:58] is sacrifice more important than
[22:00] obedience obedience is better than
[22:02] sacrifice
[22:03] disobedience is a sin of witchcraft we
[22:05] have
[22:06] to conform and conform to his will
[22:09] and tonight i have a testimony i like to
[22:11] read share with you
[22:13] by god's grace um i know i didn't ask
[22:16] brother but i want to say to some
[22:18] uh brother kelly's out and he shared
[22:20] something he said dear brother ovid i
[22:22] was very humbled
[22:23] by yesterday's invitation to know the
[22:25] mind of god although we heard the
[22:27] message of obedience is better than
[22:28] sacrifice
[22:29] when it was first preached zeida and i
[22:32] both agreed that we didn't really hear
[22:33] it
[22:34] at all last time i just say that we have
[22:37] really been blessed and strengthened and
[22:39] comforted
[22:40] by the lord as we listen this time in
[22:42] fact every service that has been
[22:44] replayed
[22:45] has been greatly devoured by us
[22:46] spiritually speaking truthfully i wasn't
[22:49] able to hear much
[22:50] of anything in times past but this year
[22:52] has been really different
[22:53] and i am thanking god daily by having
[22:56] passed some debt under life i wanted you
[22:58] to know that i took the experience i
[23:01] wrote to you one word
[23:02] to really see what it was and to my joy
[23:05] found it all over the message
[23:06] all over the bible it's not a day that
[23:08] passes that i don't consider that
[23:10] wonderful
[23:11] but wonder that the lord has actually
[23:13] made me a real christian
[23:15] only someone who has been born as i can
[23:19] understand the contrast i marvel at it
[23:21] every day
[23:22] and the joy of it is i keep growing
[23:25] zeida and i pray daily for you and your
[23:27] wife and family and the church they're
[23:28] in trinidad
[23:29] although we are at a great distance from
[23:31] each other our hearts are bound up
[23:33] with you all and we look forward to
[23:35] every time
[23:36] we can be together with you in the zoom
[23:39] chat rooms may god
[23:40] greatest care and blessing be with you
[23:42] and your family and the church
[23:44] our brother kelly salt so we are so
[23:46] grateful we are thankful for get us all
[23:48] testimony and
[23:49] greetings from brother kelly he's the
[23:50] states and we certainly appreciate that
[23:52] tonight
[23:53] and it's so unique because i was sharing
[23:56] some brethren
[23:57] uh last night about broadly love
[24:01] and the spirit of forgiveness and how
[24:04] much we should
[24:05] enter in you know and and how is the key
[24:08] because right after broadly love is holy
[24:10] spirit
[24:12] so and the only way we could manifest
[24:15] or get this brotherly love activated
[24:19] is if there are issues around us whether
[24:21] it's family friends
[24:22] church people whatever there's going to
[24:24] be stuff that people do to you
[24:26] it's not fear it's not right and is
[24:30] uh they are not being tested you are
[24:33] it's how you
[24:34] manage the issues around your life and
[24:36] that demonstrates a lot
[24:38] of your maturity see so like brotherly
[24:41] kindness
[24:42] and i call it the spirit of forgiveness
[24:44] not talk
[24:45] not not not saying back rather because
[24:47] that talk
[24:48] but but really something that that lives
[24:51] out
[24:52] and so on so blow my testimony came
[24:56] this evening here i got a phone call and
[24:58] brother was sharing with me about
[25:00] after sunday service obedience is better
[25:03] than sacrifice that
[25:05] you know come to his heart about
[25:06] something he did 25 years ago
[25:09] it is both how he really you know
[25:11] treated him badly and
[25:13] and and not only that a year ago when he
[25:15] was overseas
[25:16] he shared with another gentleman that if
[25:18] he could only get in contact with that
[25:20] man he would tell him
[25:21] he's sorry how he acted and different
[25:23] things like that but he didn't know
[25:24] where he was at
[25:25] something that happened 25 years ago but
[25:27] it kind of arrived in him so he was
[25:29] wondering
[25:29] and you know what he did now i got his
[25:32] testimony
[25:32] just about an hour or so ago and he did
[25:36] make some calls get to find out where
[25:38] this man is at finally get to speak to
[25:40] him
[25:41] and the man was so happy to hear his
[25:45] voice
[25:46] and the man say well he himself has been
[25:47] badly beheaded badly
[25:49] even you know things was real good and
[25:51] so on and making it up and so like that
[25:53] and this brother testified that after
[25:56] doing that
[25:56] he felt light and that is something
[26:00] really powerful he said that message
[26:04] obedience is better than sacrifice spoke
[26:06] to him
[26:08] it really did something for him and i
[26:10] find it was really powerful
[26:11] and he said since that time um that was
[26:14] like yesterday
[26:16] that happened that he called the guy and
[26:17] make his right and today
[26:20] he got emails with job offers and you
[26:22] know and
[26:23] it's amazing how things connect with
[26:24] things you know and i
[26:26] and i keep seeing that you may feel
[26:30] powerful because of decisions you make
[26:34] or decisions you want to make all
[26:37] decisions you are going to make
[26:40] but you are not in charge of the outcome
[26:43] of those decisions make
[26:46] the decisions wisely
[26:50] regardless of what family or friends
[26:53] try by god's grace to pray
[26:56] and get a feel of
[26:59] should i really do this should i
[27:03] you know do this because here it is i am
[27:06] not
[27:06] convicting this brother's heart to make
[27:09] this
[27:10] right of something that of an attitude
[27:12] that he had
[27:13] 25 years ago and he told me he said well
[27:16] over this i know
[27:17] that i am doing the right thing i know
[27:21] i'm doing the right thing
[27:22] and it's a comfort in your spirit in
[27:24] your heart and mind
[27:26] to know that you are doing the right
[27:28] thing
[27:29] and you know uh we have to get to that
[27:32] spot
[27:33] if you know people will hate you love
[27:36] them still
[27:37] if you know people you give them and
[27:39] they wouldn't give you back
[27:40] give them still if they would reward you
[27:43] or honor you honor them still
[27:45] do the right thing the prophet said this
[27:47] way
[27:48] is you think right you speak right you
[27:51] do right you would come out right and i
[27:54] believe god will honor his word and god
[27:56] told them when miriam came out of the
[27:58] red sea and they came out and married
[28:00] him
[28:00] dance and the bangla river you go see if
[28:03] you listen to me and obey me
[28:05] all the plagues that hit egypt and
[28:07] whatnot will not hit you
[28:08] it will not come nigh and what god will
[28:11] be asking for is obedience
[28:14] the thing of it is jesus himself learned
[28:17] obedience so venus is not an automatic
[28:19] thing it's not a pill you take and
[28:21] swallow it
[28:22] um obedience is not for laity only
[28:25] no obedience is for all
[28:28] it have men of god who disobeys just
[28:31] like saul
[28:32] a king of all kind of people who jonah
[28:35] he
[28:36] he didn't see the need to go down to
[28:37] another because the never different
[28:39] people culture everything else
[28:40] he head down to nineveh he had gone to a
[28:43] tashish rather
[28:44] and got her to straighten him out and
[28:45] get him right back on track and if the
[28:48] night you're in this room
[28:49] and you're not on track god's desire for
[28:52] you is to come on track
[28:55] god desire for you is not to embarrass
[28:56] you and shame you and
[28:58] make you look like a laugh and stop
[29:00] that's not god's objective
[29:02] god objective is to redeem to restore
[29:05] and bring back so trust the night that
[29:09] this would help you what we share here
[29:11] tonight and it will edify you
[29:13] don't know how long i'll be but i trust
[29:14] him that um we'll be blessed tonight
[29:17] amen so if you have your bibles i'd like
[29:19] you to turn to acts chapter 19
[29:21] 1-6 and we want to read from jeremiah
[29:25] 8 14-22 again
[29:28] welcome acts chapter 19 reading from
[29:30] verse 1. it came to pass
[29:32] that while apollos was as current spall
[29:36] having passed through the upper coast of
[29:38] came to ephesus and finding certain
[29:40] disciples
[29:40] he said to them have you received the
[29:42] holy questions you believe
[29:44] in other words have you been inoculated
[29:47] and they said unto him
[29:48] we have not so much has heard whether
[29:50] there be any holy ghost
[29:52] answer them unto what then will you
[29:53] baptize they said unto john's baptism
[29:57] and then said paul john
[30:00] verily baptized with the baptism of
[30:02] repentance seen unto the people
[30:04] that they should believe on him which
[30:05] should come after him that is in christ
[30:07] jesus
[30:08] and when they heard this they were
[30:10] baptized in the name of the lord jesus
[30:12] and when paul had laid his hands upon
[30:14] them the holy ghost came on them
[30:17] they didn't become the holy ghost the
[30:19] holy ghost came on them
[30:21] and they speak with tongues and
[30:23] prophesied
[30:24] jeremiah chapter 8 reading from verse
[30:26] 40.
[30:28] jeremiah chapter 8 verse 14. why do we
[30:31] sit still
[30:32] assemble yourselves let us enter into
[30:36] the defense cities let us be silent
[30:39] there for the lord our god had put us in
[30:41] silence and give us
[30:43] water of gold to drink because we have
[30:45] sinned
[30:46] against the lord we look for peace and
[30:49] no good come
[30:50] and for a time of health and behold
[30:52] trouble the snorting of his horses were
[30:54] heard from them
[30:55] the whole land tremble are the song of
[30:57] the name of the strong ones for the
[30:59] outcome
[31:00] and have devoured the land and all that
[31:01] is in it the city
[31:03] and those are dwell therein for behold i
[31:05] will send serpents
[31:06] choices among you and they will not
[31:08] be charmed
[31:09] and they shall bite you saith the lord
[31:12] when i would comfort myself against
[31:13] sorrow
[31:14] my heart is fainting me behold the voice
[31:18] of the cry of the daughter of my people
[31:20] because of them that dwell in
[31:22] a far country is not the lord in zion
[31:25] it's not her king in her why have they
[31:28] provoked me
[31:29] to anger with their grieving images
[31:32] and their strange vanities the harvest
[31:35] is passed
[31:36] the summer is ended and we are not safe
[31:40] for the hurt of the daughter of my
[31:41] people am i hood i am black
[31:44] astonishment have taking hold of me is
[31:46] there an obama in gilead
[31:49] is there no physician dear why then is
[31:52] not the health
[31:53] of the daughter of my people recovered
[31:55] let us pray
[31:56] father god we pray one more time on your
[31:58] scriptures on your word that you'd bless
[32:00] it interpret your heart and jesus might
[32:02] ask it amen
[32:03] the amplified of that last verse verse
[32:05] 22 says is there an obama
[32:07] gilead is there no physician dear
[32:10] why then is not the health of the
[32:13] daughter of my people restored
[32:16] because zion no longer enjoyed
[32:21] the presence of the great physician
[32:25] and that's the question why why
[32:28] and brother branham was speaking and
[32:29] talking about uh
[32:31] if a man went to the doorstep of a
[32:34] doctor
[32:35] the disease right at the daughter
[32:38] doorstep of the doctor can you blame the
[32:40] doctor if he doesn't want to take the
[32:42] medication
[32:43] you you can blame the toxin who to blame
[32:46] can't blame the doctor he's got the
[32:47] toxin
[32:48] he's willing to give it can't blame the
[32:50] toxin science has found it
[32:52] a disease so he dies right on the
[32:54] doorstep
[32:55] but don't blame the doctor people are
[32:57] dying right in the pews from sin
[32:59] it is not because we haven't got toxin
[33:02] isn't it isn't because we haven't got
[33:03] physicians
[33:04] is because the people don't want to take
[33:06] it and if we could fix your arm up it's
[33:09] a dangerous thing not to do that you
[33:10] should do it
[33:11] it's dangerous if you don't do it there
[33:14] was a time we didn't have much toxin
[33:16] people died with bacteria they got a
[33:18] toxin fentanyl or like a vaccine fit you
[33:20] say
[33:21] polio is salt toxin i sure appreciate
[33:25] that
[33:25] i believe a man if man can be more
[33:27] humble but abraham you believe in divine
[33:29] healing you say
[33:30] all of that is divine healing because
[33:32] only god could heal
[33:33] i am the lord thy god who healed all thy
[33:36] diseases
[33:37] he said no missing so far it is
[33:39] dangerous to take
[33:40] generally because you see you hear
[33:42] stories about like somebody took the
[33:44] vaccine and died
[33:46] listen the vaccine
[33:50] always affect somebody negatively there
[33:52] are people who cannot have they just
[33:53] don't have this health system or
[33:54] whatever
[33:55] whatever it is so he says it's dangerous
[33:57] to take but you might get by with not
[33:59] taking the doctor's toxin
[34:01] but you can't get by without taking
[34:04] gorge toxin
[34:05] is bomb you can't do it he says
[34:08] now how do they find a toxin how do they
[34:11] find a vaccine
[34:12] well science reads up on a whole lot of
[34:14] stuff and they boil it together and they
[34:16] put test tubes and so forth
[34:17] and after a while they get down to where
[34:20] they think they got it
[34:21] they shoot it into a guinea pig and if
[34:23] he survives it
[34:24] then they shoot it in you right you know
[34:27] mesut will kill some people and help
[34:28] some others
[34:30] penicillin has killed many and it has
[34:33] helped
[34:34] about you know when i went to the doctor
[34:36] today they asked me if i lose you to
[34:37] anything
[34:38] i tell them the red and white penicillin
[34:41] um tablet
[34:42] i am illusions did that because one time
[34:44] years ago i was sick and i went hospital
[34:47] they gave me these tablets and i was
[34:48] getting worse first and i recognized
[34:50] they were trying to kill me
[34:51] and since then they say that i'm not
[34:52] supposed to see that tablet so every
[34:54] time i go to hospital
[34:55] i have a kind of not fear i say you know
[34:57] what cosmetics is not a nice person
[34:59] i feel like the devil just waiting to
[35:01] finish you off he want to kill you
[35:03] and he will kill you if you can because
[35:05] that is his currency
[35:07] he trades in debt so you see so this is
[35:10] uh the prophet
[35:11] i want to just continue here now he said
[35:13] penicillin has killed as many as it
[35:14] helped
[35:15] that's right i was reading about it the
[35:16] other day we had nurse take pencilling
[35:18] for the last 15 years or more
[35:20] she took her dose and killed her
[35:21] instantly see it'll kill some help some
[35:24] because all people are not made
[35:27] like guinea pigs see that's the reason
[35:30] it helps some
[35:30] and kills the other but god's toxin
[35:33] helps
[35:34] all it cures it's not a remedy
[35:38] it's a cure see the number one killer
[35:42] is his heart he said i want to differ
[35:44] with you the numbers
[35:45] number one killer is sin trouble that's
[35:47] the number one killer
[35:48] you say i can't quit smoking i can't
[35:50] quit
[35:51] i have been untrue to my wife brother
[35:52] branham i just can't quit it one woman
[35:54] is not enough for me
[35:55] the other one one woman said oh i don't
[35:57] know brother branham i just started as a
[35:59] young guilty run around
[36:00] i just can't quit breaking up my home
[36:03] you know what
[36:04] it's just because you didn't try the
[36:05] toxin you just refused to take it we
[36:08] have
[36:08] got stuff that kills that we have got
[36:11] the stuff that makes you live
[36:12] decent to your wife and email we have
[36:14] got the things that take the desire of
[36:15] cigarettes out of you
[36:17] we have got this stuff that takes the
[36:18] sin out of you but if you refuse to take
[36:20] it
[36:21] you just won't try the toxin you're
[36:23] afraid of your social standing
[36:26] you're afraid of the new book and we
[36:27] know the new book is a mess
[36:29] people don't want to get messy and we
[36:31] have something here a man that is
[36:33] born again when you're born again is
[36:36] when the control
[36:38] of his life it is center
[36:42] its direction is passing himself to god
[36:47] and that's a sign of somebody born again
[36:50] when they no longer on the i think i and
[36:53] i and me and i and me and i
[36:55] when the center of your control is
[36:58] passed
[36:58] over to god so you are interested
[37:01] in what is god's mind what is god's will
[37:05] what is god's plan what is god's purpose
[37:08] god becomes first before husband before
[37:12] wife
[37:12] before children before family god
[37:16] comes first he becomes the control he's
[37:19] at the center there
[37:20] he's directing your life and you will
[37:22] see fruits of it
[37:24] you would see fruits i knew it
[37:26] personally
[37:27] as a not just as a minister or a pastor
[37:30] as a christian as a believer i see
[37:34] the hand of god guide my steps and guide
[37:37] me
[37:37] in my marriage my relationship my
[37:39] children you know different steps to the
[37:41] way you see
[37:42] what if i had made a different decision
[37:44] what if i made a different choice
[37:46] i love choices i love decisions because
[37:48] decisions
[37:50] give you know the opportunity for you to
[37:53] to choose based upon what is clicking in
[37:55] your system
[37:56] and that brother today he had a choice
[37:58] he could have just dismissed that uh
[37:59] about 25 years ago
[38:00] why i believe that but you see god want
[38:03] to free him
[38:04] lightness spirit and if that is
[38:06] something that is cloudy over him
[38:08] uh that's the only way it could be
[38:09] lifted out now not only that
[38:12] he no other opportunity to testify to
[38:15] that man
[38:16] about the love the power and the kingdom
[38:18] of god because the man will wonder
[38:20] oh and it all these years you calling me
[38:24] to tell me that
[38:25] it's just as a kind of mind-blowing
[38:26] thing like that i remember when i came
[38:28] to the lord
[38:29] i was going backward instead of forward
[38:31] i believe mission viola
[38:32] i'm reading my spoken word books and um
[38:35] you know my
[38:36] mother telling me and i'm not even
[38:37] listening because i i only word it you
[38:39] know what i mean and like going
[38:40] downstairs like young person
[38:41] and something like that and one day my
[38:44] sister told me
[38:46] she said you are so hard
[38:49] and then it struck me because the spirit
[38:51] of speaking in my heart
[38:52] whatever they say right to do do it and
[38:54] i say sister i am sorry
[38:55] she jumped she said you sorry is that
[38:58] you she didn't expect these words out to
[39:00] me
[39:00] so what was happening is that because of
[39:02] my knowledge
[39:04] i became arrogant because of what i knew
[39:08] we were all catholics and i know
[39:09] something better than them i know what
[39:11] rome and revelation 17 and different
[39:14] things like that
[39:15] you see so instead of going forward with
[39:18] humility and everything else i was going
[39:19] backwards not knowing it
[39:21] with head with intellect you see
[39:24] so like moses who parents
[39:27] taught him and shared stuff with him he
[39:29] was peddling but intellect and his
[39:31] intellect really
[39:32] allow him to kill one man and run that
[39:34] what intellect does
[39:35] it could only last so much it could only
[39:38] give you so much
[39:39] strength but when he met that pillar
[39:40] fire his whole life
[39:42] was changed and transformed that is why
[39:45] the program says five minutes
[39:46] in the presence of that pillar of fire
[39:48] it was more than all the
[39:50] 40 years of knowledge information and so
[39:52] on that he had in egypt
[39:54] so i know you could be changed in five
[39:56] minutes time
[39:57] whether right now while the word is
[39:58] speaking you get that presence of god
[40:01] affecting your life or even after when
[40:04] you bow and pray and so on like that
[40:06] it could change you we don't hear much
[40:08] about this in the message you hear about
[40:10] what people know
[40:11] and what revelation they have and
[40:12] they're trying to show that they know
[40:14] something more than somebody else
[40:16] and you know the devil just laugh at
[40:17] that because that ain't cast not no
[40:18] devil
[40:19] you know that ain't moving no enemy and
[40:21] so on what we need to see
[40:23] is active sun sun's being activated
[40:27] that they be empowered in the in the
[40:30] kingdom of god for the kingdom sea
[40:32] so it goes beyond your household it goes
[40:35] beyond your family
[40:36] you are son of the kingdom the realm
[40:39] that god wants to bring us
[40:40] into is this realm of the kingdom jesus
[40:43] said to this way
[40:44] my kingdom is not of this world so all
[40:47] the disciples was being breathed into
[40:49] another world that jesus was living in
[40:51] normal
[40:52] they knew not about that world but he
[40:55] had to testify
[40:56] of the power of that world and you know
[40:59] the other time
[41:00] a woman was going to see brother branham
[41:02] and she wanted to be healed
[41:03] and he told her he said go on stand by
[41:05] the street and across the street in
[41:07] lights
[41:08] and you'll meet a man and he will turn
[41:10] you to a doctor
[41:11] who would perform the operation and
[41:13] you'll be healed no you can't figure out
[41:15] these things
[41:17] you cannot do like how neyman said the
[41:19] man of god supposed to come outside and
[41:21] lay hands and do that i know he likes
[41:23] them go and wash seven times in jordan
[41:25] river
[41:26] we cannot tell god how to fulfill his
[41:30] word
[41:31] and how to bring the past healing
[41:33] restoration
[41:34] redemption deliverance in our lives
[41:37] every one of you as an
[41:38] individual have a name
[41:42] you don't have the same name in this
[41:43] room everybody have an individual name
[41:46] individual fingerprint and every one of
[41:49] you will have your individual trials
[41:51] individual questions
[41:52] every individual challenges some people
[41:55] are more loved than others more
[41:56] forgiveness than others more decent
[41:57] others and whatnot so god knows what is
[41:59] out of there
[42:00] but more than what god knows is what
[42:03] the enemy have access to so you see
[42:08] because we are falten because he's a
[42:10] prince of the power of the ear
[42:12] because he reading and ruling here for
[42:14] the last how much thousands of years
[42:16] the enemy he have access to inflict with
[42:20] sicknesses
[42:20] disease and all kinds of things like
[42:22] that that's his right
[42:24] and the final access he has is really
[42:26] hook stick
[42:27] the grim reaper which is dead
[42:30] and if he could get you fearful you
[42:32] panic
[42:34] but paul said that where's your sting
[42:37] graveyard is your victory
[42:38] then guys talk differently now people
[42:41] who going on before
[42:42] go on and ahead and trying to get
[42:43] brethren what's going on thank god for
[42:46] them
[42:46] they're in a better place and better
[42:47] world they they leave us here
[42:49] not just to see troubles you know i see
[42:51] like some people firing off and going
[42:53] and
[42:53] they leave it as bad boy you know but
[42:56] they're leaving us back not just to see
[42:58] troubles as such
[42:59] but they are leaving us back that we
[43:01] could come to perfection
[43:03] or let's see it come to full maturity
[43:05] because we need to come to perfection
[43:07] in order to bring the resurrection day
[43:08] with us and not be perfect be without us
[43:11] are not made perfect so brethren
[43:15] we have something to strive unto we
[43:18] we're not striving to be a better church
[43:20] no we are striving to fulfill the
[43:23] promised world
[43:24] like jesus said it his spirit is upon me
[43:27] for what
[43:28] but he anointed me to do what to fulfill
[43:31] the word of that day we cannot stop what
[43:34] the government's going to do they have
[43:35] to do it
[43:36] they have no choice because satan
[43:39] controlling governments
[43:40] controlling the world system controlling
[43:43] styles and fashion
[43:45] controlling entertainment so he's
[43:48] controlling the entire system
[43:50] so the whole world system is influenced
[43:53] by lucifer
[43:54] whether they have tied jacket whether
[43:56] they look nice talk peaceful
[43:58] is controlled by that all the false
[44:01] prophets and have a ton of them just
[44:02] that jesus prophesied
[44:04] is controlled by the devil
[44:07] the churches controlled by the devil the
[44:10] bible talked about
[44:11] they have blasphemous names
[44:14] so at the end time is not church it's a
[44:17] people
[44:18] by his name's sake he's calling out the
[44:20] gentiles
[44:21] that is where you are being called out a
[44:24] people for his namesake
[44:26] not church but a people a bride
[44:29] bible talk about his wife had made
[44:31] herself ready
[44:33] not somebody come and dress your heart
[44:35] made herself ready so that means
[44:38] just like the wise virgin get extra oil
[44:40] they are going to be a people that not
[44:42] satisfied
[44:43] just have a container but they have to
[44:45] have extra
[44:48] because when the foolish virgins wake up
[44:50] and recognize listen time to leave
[44:52] like a lump and move they recognize the
[44:54] oil ran out
[44:56] they had something you know all of them
[44:58] have something
[44:59] but will it last will it face the test
[45:04] will it will it deal with the challenges
[45:06] that is before us
[45:09] because when god gave the prophet the
[45:10] test he said you have been given power
[45:13] i'll share with you some bridges you'll
[45:14] be given power to buy any member
[45:16] but be more sincere he's a prophet
[45:19] you have a heart for the people you have
[45:21] for the god and
[45:22] the thing of it is that snake that mamba
[45:24] which is the most
[45:26] vicious dangerous african snake the
[45:28] black mama
[45:30] that member couldn't touch the prophet
[45:33] but you know what was killing going
[45:34] after brethren
[45:37] now if if the prophet was that is
[45:40] touching me or all your
[45:41] on your own you know what happened the
[45:44] black mamba taken off people
[45:45] one by one by one but the power was
[45:48] given to him
[45:50] not if you be sincere get it
[45:53] note what was said not if
[45:56] you are sincere you will get the power
[45:59] but you have been
[46:00] given power but here what i want you to
[46:02] do
[46:03] clean up re-examine
[46:06] search your heart i want it to come
[46:09] deeper
[46:10] this is not a head thing i want to get a
[46:13] burden for others
[46:14] i want you to see that if it can't
[46:16] affect you it gonna affect
[46:18] others and you have the power to bind
[46:21] the danger
[46:22] that could affect others ministers
[46:27] could be very dangerous because their
[46:30] words given to people and to the
[46:32] congregation
[46:33] is very important it's very important
[46:37] and people hold on to some words that
[46:39] they say
[46:40] so it's it's it's it's important
[46:43] what we present and what we see that we
[46:46] don't inject
[46:47] our own bias on our own feelings and
[46:49] thoughts about the matter
[46:52] so i can say to you the vaccine is satan
[46:55] is lucifer
[46:56] and you know the the the um the polio
[46:59] vaccine is proven
[47:00] and it's back to improvement is man that
[47:02] when that god inspired man to reduction
[47:06] this is your point is that man just do
[47:08] no
[47:09] is god inspire man to discover this
[47:12] medication and that medication
[47:14] so sure it might be negative on one or
[47:15] two people out of a million or whatever
[47:17] it is but the reality is
[47:19] god is the one who's a healer and he
[47:22] used different ways of healing
[47:24] you could take herbs you could do this
[47:26] you could pray you could get divine
[47:27] healing miracles whatever
[47:29] but god is the one in charge of that
[47:32] so i cannot tell people you know what
[47:34] this is this and this won't
[47:35] ever take this this will happen why
[47:38] don't people say rejecting the holy
[47:40] ghost has taken immaculate peace
[47:42] and did it right there
[47:45] rejecting this holy ghost we talk about
[47:48] in acts 19
[47:49] is taking the mark of the beast because
[47:52] all that dwell on the earth
[47:54] whose name is not written they don't
[47:55] have the mark of god it's just two marks
[47:58] it's not 20 marks and pick a choice it's
[48:01] either the mark of the beast or the mark
[48:03] of god
[48:04] and you get god's seal not to make your
[48:07] son
[48:08] but because you are son god could put
[48:11] his seal upon you
[48:13] that is why you are who you are i
[48:16] remember the early days i said myself
[48:17] lord why did you call me
[48:20] why did you you know because you feel
[48:22] here you're falling and you want to know
[48:24] well
[48:24] what is this thing that you can't you
[48:26] have to get back to the world you have
[48:28] to get back to god
[48:29] you have to get back and pray god put
[48:31] the seed inside of you and that seed of
[48:33] a toast
[48:34] so regardless of what your flesh act up
[48:36] or your spirit accurate
[48:37] that seed and you have a tooth tonight
[48:40] oh blessed be the name of the lord do
[48:41] you love him tonight
[48:43] oh praise the lord give him some praise
[48:44] give him some worship
[48:46] so therefore when you are born again
[48:50] the control of your life is not you it's
[48:52] not
[48:53] you are the source and you're thinking
[48:54] and this isn't me and this is me oh yeah
[48:56] that is you you need to be born again
[48:59] afterwards the center changes where it's
[49:02] of god now
[49:05] prophet said you're afraid of the new
[49:07] birth it only makes you a different
[49:10] person
[49:11] if you're not a different person then
[49:13] you're not converted
[49:14] you might be converted into denomination
[49:16] you might be converted into a different
[49:18] atmosphere or something but when you are
[49:19] converted to god
[49:20] then you live holy when you are
[49:23] converted to god
[49:25] then you live holy i believe in holiness
[49:29] i can prove you by the bible and i don't
[49:31] care what you do
[49:33] you cannot offer god a gift
[49:36] with unholy hands he won't receive it
[49:40] the gifts in the old testament had to be
[49:43] sanctified at the altar
[49:45] the priests before he could go in to
[49:48] offer it
[49:49] had to be anointed and sanctified or the
[49:52] gift was refused
[49:54] god will not accept the gift by an holy
[49:56] hand
[49:57] that's right it must come true holy
[50:00] hands
[50:00] or you won't accept it and that's why
[50:02] the bible says if you go to pray
[50:05] and you know you have something against
[50:07] your brother
[50:08] leave a gift at the altar go and make it
[50:12] right with your brother
[50:13] and then come back and pray because this
[50:16] faith we're going back to
[50:18] this ephesians fate is based on
[50:20] forgiveness
[50:22] it doesn't beat a sitting down
[50:23] intellectual say you believe something
[50:25] it is based on
[50:27] real forgiveness and that forgiveness
[50:30] has to be
[50:31] manifested in us we know the story
[50:35] about brother brown he went into this
[50:37] restaurant
[50:38] he saw this woman carrying out with some
[50:39] men and different things
[50:41] it upset him rightly so
[50:44] then he put himself in a corner and said
[50:46] lord is this the place
[50:48] where my daughter want to raise up why
[50:50] don't you condemn this place and wipe
[50:51] this place out
[50:54] god tapping on my shoulder pull him
[50:56] aside
[50:58] sway when he was small swim tea
[51:00] committing sins and stuff and his sins
[51:02] going up
[51:03] to god showing a blood bump around the
[51:06] earth keep boxing it off not reaching
[51:07] god
[51:08] boxing it off show him he's right on a
[51:11] book called pardon
[51:12] showing his sins trapped in the sea of
[51:14] forgetfulness all that is by vision
[51:17] and that god tells him i forgive you
[51:21] and you condemn her now this is a real
[51:25] experience this is not talk
[51:29] and talk and talk this
[51:32] is showing the kind of heart god has
[51:35] the kind of compassion and this is what
[51:37] i'm saying
[51:38] if we're talking about jesus christ you
[51:40] see him yesterday
[51:41] today and forever we have to see the
[51:44] same kind of compassion
[51:46] the same kind of love the same kind of
[51:49] care the same kind of concern
[51:51] we have to see that to talk about
[51:53] message
[51:55] this is where jesus ministry when was
[51:57] called in the adultery of the act of
[51:59] adultery
[52:00] we see it in jesus ministry with the
[52:02] woman at the well
[52:04] we see it in jesus ministry where the
[52:05] woman was crying at his feet and wiping
[52:07] his feet and
[52:08] drying his seat with her ear we see it
[52:10] all over to the bible
[52:12] and if we see that is god or word made
[52:14] flesh
[52:15] and you see his behavior where is all
[52:18] this
[52:19] legalistic condemning
[52:22] writing of people who is shocked who are
[52:24] making it who going to hell and
[52:26] where's all of that and human beings
[52:31] human beings putting people in and
[52:33] putting people out the kingdom
[52:35] where is all of that coming from
[52:39] think about it hell has enlarged its
[52:43] mouth the devil trying to pull down into
[52:46] hell
[52:46] every soul he can and heaven has opened
[52:49] up
[52:50] to try to pull up everybody that is here
[52:54] we're in a war that war is on tonight
[52:58] it's a war for your soul and sometimes i
[53:01] wonder and i see sometimes god snatched
[53:04] people off the earth
[53:06] and i was talking to my wife and telling
[53:08] you know is it worth it
[53:10] the lust for power the lust for
[53:12] popularity the
[53:14] lust for fame and after people become
[53:16] famous and
[53:17] popular and they're well known and
[53:19] everybody know them and so on
[53:21] both in the secular and religious realm
[53:24] you see the world come crashing down
[53:27] flesh and blood is it really worth it
[53:32] you want power you want this and when
[53:34] you get it afterwards
[53:36] that time just done just just flit away
[53:40] i don't wonder why the bible said what
[53:42] shall the prophet under he
[53:43] gain the whole world and lose
[53:46] his soul oh my trust the night that
[53:50] you're being helped
[53:52] is there a bomb in gilead is there no
[53:55] physician dear
[53:57] you know jesus prophet said he was
[54:00] baptized in jordan
[54:02] dove came this is by beloved son
[54:05] and he inoculated he got an inoculation
[54:08] himself
[54:08] he got god's toxin which was the holy
[54:11] ghost itself
[54:12] and the fullness when he was tempted he
[54:14] talks and held
[54:16] a vaccine hell you could say when he
[54:18] smite his face
[54:19] he was riled up on he didn't speak back
[54:22] when he put a rat upon his head if
[54:23] you're a prophet
[54:24] tell us who hit you he talks in hell and
[54:26] they pull his beard out of his face he
[54:28] spits on his face
[54:29] and so on and he went to calvary to talk
[54:31] to him in the hour of death
[54:34] he talks in hell but on easter morning
[54:36] it proved it was god toxin gives
[54:39] eternal life and
[54:42] this is a just a little backdrop here he
[54:44] says you know when the doctors want to
[54:46] try the toxin they scored it in the
[54:47] guinea pig
[54:48] see how he acts you know when god
[54:50] brought his toxin down
[54:51] he didn't put a guinea pig he put it in
[54:53] his son himself
[54:55] he made himself a body he overshadowed a
[54:57] virgin mary he created a body
[54:59] and he separated himself isn't that
[55:01] right and he put that didn't get that
[55:03] guinea pig his own son
[55:04] his own life was on the punishment and
[55:06] he said you know there was a time there
[55:08] was
[55:08] wasn't any toxins for smallpox many die
[55:11] with smallpox
[55:12] bacteria when an epidemic breaks out in
[55:14] the city
[55:15] quickly you go down and get a smallpox
[55:17] vaccination
[55:18] or deteriorate shot they got toxic i'm
[55:21] thankful for that
[55:22] i'm glad of that i'm glad we got it the
[55:25] salt vaccine for little children
[55:27] i thank the lord for that and pray he
[55:28] will give us more and more
[55:30] i believe if we just warm up to god
[55:32] there are things
[55:33] here for us we was made out of the earth
[55:36] you know
[55:37] if we warm up to him and pray to him and
[55:39] quit our wickedness and things
[55:40] all these things will be found that's
[55:42] right for you who believe he's got a
[55:45] remedy beyond that
[55:46] he said god bomb wasn't perfect because
[55:49] in the beginning because it was drawn
[55:51] from the veins of animals
[55:52] that only covered sin it didn't divorce
[55:55] it
[55:55] there was no excuse now but one day god
[55:58] made a toxin
[55:59] he said and he gave it to his son and he
[56:01] inoculated him
[56:03] at the jordan and when the holy ghost
[56:06] come down upon him every eye
[56:09] watch him as he lives he lived the life
[56:12] of god
[56:13] he looked like god he acted like god he
[56:16] he lived like god he prayed like god he
[56:18] healed like god
[56:19] he raised a dead like god he was god he
[56:22] was inoculated
[56:23] from the things of the world and they
[56:25] watched them and they all of his death
[56:27] the inoculation held and they knew he
[56:29] was a prophet
[56:30] a roman soldier put raga on his head and
[56:33] they closed his eyes and he took a stick
[56:34] and he hit him on the head and said no
[56:35] if you be a prophet
[56:37] tell us who hit you and we believe you
[56:39] the inoculation held
[56:41] he said and when they took a handful off
[56:45] of his beard
[56:46] and they spit on him he said and his own
[56:48] children cried for his blood
[56:50] the inoculation held he said father
[56:52] forgiveness
[56:53] they know not what they do when he was
[56:56] riled upon
[56:57] he ran back the inoculation held all
[57:00] hell was looking to see if that could
[57:03] hold
[57:03] he was making a way for you and i making
[57:06] an example
[57:08] and when he died at the cross the
[57:10] inauguration held
[57:11] at least a morning it proved it so dead
[57:14] couldn't hold it
[57:15] life and death can't exist in the same
[57:17] place he rose on the third day
[57:19] the obnoxious inoculation health you're
[57:21] sending on high
[57:22] and people began to long they wanted the
[57:24] inoculation
[57:26] finally there had been a serum there had
[57:29] been a serum given by god
[57:31] that would raise up the dead from the
[57:32] grave they wanted that
[57:34] inoculation and the first one i heard of
[57:36] it i wanted it to
[57:37] i am so glad we still have plenty of it
[57:40] inoculation from sin oh my there was a
[57:44] hundred and twenty become patience right
[57:45] away
[57:46] for this scene it's hold in temptation
[57:49] my god
[57:50] and what happened it went in the upper
[57:52] room they seen it in the hour of
[57:54] temptation
[57:55] it held in the hour of debt and when he
[57:57] was in the grave three days and three
[57:59] nights the inauguration held
[58:00] easter morning an angel rolled the stone
[58:02] away the son of god rose
[58:05] i am so glad all that great inoculation
[58:08] that would give it for us
[58:09] tonight that people when they become
[58:13] inoculated they act funny usually they
[58:16] do
[58:17] when something some happens
[58:18] substantially it makes them become funny
[58:21] he said that when they take this shot
[58:23] strange thing
[58:24] they all got drunk looked like they were
[58:26] drunk they were dancing and acting like
[58:28] a bunch of drunk people and they said
[58:30] the people
[58:32] that wasn't inoculated said these men
[58:35] are full of new wine oh my how many
[58:38] females are inoculation tonight
[58:40] a feeling of the holy ghost tonight the
[58:42] call of god that come into your life
[58:44] no preacher can hold that back that is
[58:46] yours that is your promise
[58:48] thanks for the kingdom of god no man
[58:50] could cut you from that that is your
[58:52] promise the promise
[58:53] of the holy ghost oh my and when paul
[58:56] made these
[58:57] disciples that believe in jesus and
[58:58] begin to tell them about the holy ghost
[59:00] they say we ain't even know about this
[59:02] holy ghost and you're talking about
[59:04] and paul said how were you baptized and
[59:06] the baptists on the journey said no
[59:08] they'll be baptized again and then they
[59:10] were baptized
[59:12] and they were filled with the holy ghost
[59:14] and the question
[59:15] that was asked is have you been
[59:18] inoculated
[59:20] have you received the holy ghost since
[59:22] you believe
[59:23] he said i don't even know about this
[59:24] inoculation i didn't know since the
[59:26] coming message the other guy injection
[59:28] yeah inoculation of course you have the
[59:29] inoculation this is the power of the
[59:31] holy ghost
[59:32] run to your vein this is what make you
[59:34] abram royal seed
[59:35] the seed of abraham wasn't just isaac
[59:37] and ishmael
[59:39] christ was the real seed of abraham it's
[59:42] a fake seed
[59:43] and that faith was confirmed by
[59:44] circumcision and the circumcision and
[59:46] is the circumcision of our hearts by the
[59:48] holy ghost the gospel wanted circumcised
[59:51] even the child of israel we know they
[59:53] were had the sign of circumcision
[59:55] and there were babies born to them in
[59:57] the wilderness what did god do when they
[59:58] cross over jordan
[1:00:00] well i think it was in joshua chapter
[1:00:01] five all those
[1:00:03] children that were born in in the
[1:00:05] journey
[1:00:06] had to be circumcised also so it's not
[1:00:08] because in the land
[1:00:09] and the land i don't need this and i
[1:00:11] don't need that no no no
[1:00:12] no go out of the way you come by pass
[1:00:15] that away you have to be circumcised
[1:00:17] there is a promise of the holy ghost for

[1:00:42] that

[1:00:45] but it's a power to say i am sorry
[1:00:47] power to say please forgive me a power
[1:00:49] to do that a literal power
[1:00:52] oh god help us tonight what do you think
[1:00:54] will make the church come together
[1:00:56] in the unity of the field it will take a
[1:00:57] power because the spirit of man
[1:01:00] is what is hindering the unity the
[1:01:02] spirit of man
[1:01:03] is what have all these this this walls
[1:01:06] and these protections and these barriers
[1:01:08] that ministers
[1:01:09] set up and the spirit of god going to
[1:01:11] fall so much that the ducks will have
[1:01:13] fellowship
[1:01:14] god will flood this message with his
[1:01:16] presence with his spirit which is power
[1:01:18] it will transform every single thing
[1:01:21] oh blessed be the name of the lord have
[1:01:23] you received
[1:01:24] the holy ghost since you believe brahma
[1:01:26] says you cannot receive it until you
[1:01:28] know what it is
[1:01:29] you cannot receive it until you know it
[1:01:30] is given for you you cannot receive it
[1:01:32] until you know what results it brings
[1:01:34] you'll know what you get
[1:01:35] when you get it no false spirit
[1:01:38] and if ever there was a time that you
[1:01:40] could see
[1:01:41] a manifestation of falseness and false
[1:01:44] prophets and
[1:01:45] false spirits is now you see men
[1:01:47] scrambling
[1:01:48] because the coroner virus flattened all
[1:01:51] these supermen
[1:01:52] flatting them like pancake all who is a
[1:01:54] mystery man all who feel they're adopted
[1:01:56] all they feel their power all they feel
[1:01:58] is many prophet meanings on a man
[1:01:59] many whatever they want to be god
[1:02:02] flattened them with like a pancake with
[1:02:03] hispanic
[1:02:05] nobody have this could step forward and
[1:02:06] say i am this i am that in the other
[1:02:08] god flatten the entire world because the
[1:02:10] whole system about to change
[1:02:12] and you will order what you think is
[1:02:15] happening
[1:02:16] canes children listen carefully the
[1:02:20] devil's
[1:02:20] children cain's children is who is in
[1:02:23] charge of
[1:02:24] computer and technology this same
[1:02:27] technology that people
[1:02:28] getting dependent on and worshipping on
[1:02:32] the altar
[1:02:33] of man's invention that they don't even
[1:02:35] need god
[1:02:37] because technology making everything
[1:02:38] almost instant
[1:02:40] instant communication instant talking
[1:02:42] everything phone
[1:02:43] everything any part of the world all of
[1:02:46] that
[1:02:47] is is a plan all of that is the system
[1:02:51] behind it
[1:02:52] the whole entertainment industry the
[1:02:54] whole style
[1:02:55] and fashion is controlled by the enemy
[1:02:57] it has nothing of god behind it
[1:03:00] and that is why you have to be
[1:03:01] completely delivered from the styles and
[1:03:04] fashions
[1:03:05] and the influences of this world because
[1:03:07] the influence
[1:03:08] the only way the system could change
[1:03:10] everything must be in place
[1:03:11] when brother branham got the vision of
[1:03:14] the cars moving on its own
[1:03:16] operating by a power by a radar he says
[1:03:19] and he wasn't getting on any accident
[1:03:21] the technology had us to be here for
[1:03:23] that to be possible
[1:03:25] it took all these years to bring
[1:03:28] computer technology to the point
[1:03:30] where this vision can materialize
[1:03:32] because it has to have a time for
[1:03:33] everything
[1:03:35] and just as the vision of the car
[1:03:37] materialized
[1:03:38] brother branham saw abducted sons
[1:03:40] because he was the wave sheath
[1:03:42] and the wave sheath means that other
[1:03:44] sons come into maturity
[1:03:46] so this power is not a paper thing
[1:03:50] it's not a reference point to say well
[1:03:52] god is already profit
[1:03:53] and this happened that happened no god
[1:03:55] has to be with the bride
[1:03:58] and demonstrate that power because that
[1:04:00] is what the gospel is about
[1:04:02] the gospel is not simmons the gospel is
[1:04:04] the
[1:04:05] demonstration of the power of god with
[1:04:07] signs and wonders
[1:04:08] according to what mark 16 20 the lord
[1:04:11] himself
[1:04:12] went everywhere with them confirming the
[1:04:14] word with wit
[1:04:15] wit not more word with not more
[1:04:17] mysteries with
[1:04:18] not more revelations with signs wonders
[1:04:21] and miracles
[1:04:22] and people don't want to talk about that
[1:04:23] but god does that
[1:04:25] he's the same yesterday to the unfair
[1:04:27] year you're a sinner yes
[1:04:29] saved by god's grace elected to
[1:04:31] beginners are we are not staying our
[1:04:33] sinners we come to be redeemed
[1:04:35] and we didn't come by the blood so the
[1:04:36] power we have tonight is not in
[1:04:38] ourselves
[1:04:39] but by the blood and the blood gives you
[1:04:41] access
[1:04:42] to access his presence to access his
[1:04:44] throne that accesses mercy
[1:04:46] that is what this blood is all about
[1:04:50] so you have to go and get the
[1:04:51] inoculation all the way
[1:04:53] not whether it's top or bottom is from
[1:04:55] the bottom to the top
[1:04:56] from faith virtue knowledge temperance
[1:04:59] patience godliness
[1:05:00] brotherly kindness right or not to the
[1:05:02] charity you have to get the whole thing
[1:05:04] and that inoculates you to the point
[1:05:07] where
[1:05:08] the bible said we shall not all sleep
[1:05:10] this is the
[1:05:11] first time that the grim reaper
[1:05:15] is properly challenged that dick can't
[1:05:18] touch this bride
[1:05:19] oh glory to god you should be shouting
[1:05:21] tonight i'm telling you something the
[1:05:23] grave is not for everybody
[1:05:25] it's a bride that's going to be raptured
[1:05:28] and a rapture already happened enoch
[1:05:30] i'm the enoch it happened to elijah are
[1:05:32] you going to happen to the bride
[1:05:34] so what we see has already been oh glory
[1:05:37] hallelujah what is to come has already
[1:05:39] been
[1:05:39] enoch was raptured elisha was raptured
[1:05:43] and you are going to be raptured you
[1:05:45] have a promise we shall not all sleep
[1:05:46] but we shall be changed there's somebody
[1:05:49] to fulfill
[1:05:50] that when the bible says virginia shall
[1:05:51] conceive somebody else to fulfill that
[1:05:55] so by the grace of god so tonight this
[1:05:57] was like a special
[1:05:58] i wouldn't say well bio study in a true
[1:06:01] sense of how we would go things but
[1:06:03] i felt i needed to address and talk to
[1:06:05] you about
[1:06:06] what people keep asking should i go
[1:06:08] should i inoculate and whatnot
[1:06:10] and the thing of it is that um
[1:06:13] the virus want to survive
[1:06:17] so that is why the virus mutates it
[1:06:20] wants to survive
[1:06:21] it wants to spread its wings it wants to
[1:06:22] continue inflicting
[1:06:24] economize what satan does and that does
[1:06:27] and these
[1:06:28] diseases does trying to give people a
[1:06:30] premature
[1:06:32] uh uh uh advanced
[1:06:36] trying to take you in advance when your
[1:06:38] life have put personality if you could
[1:06:40] cut you off
[1:06:41] he will cut you off that's what he tried
[1:06:43] to do with moses baby moses kill all the
[1:06:44] children
[1:06:45] try to do with jesus kill the children
[1:06:47] kill them kill the potential
[1:06:48] kill what you could become kill and
[1:06:51] cancel your vision cancel your purpose
[1:06:54] that's what killing does you
[1:06:56] you could die and you're still alive and
[1:06:59] do you know that
[1:07:00] the vision and you dying and you're
[1:07:02] still there
[1:07:04] but there's nothing there you're
[1:07:06] physically there
[1:07:07] but the purpose is not there the drive
[1:07:09] is not there
[1:07:10] you're going through the emotions it's
[1:07:12] just not there
[1:07:14] but when god revive your spirit
[1:07:18] revive you because people could be in
[1:07:20] church and that there is adorable
[1:07:22] churches kill people
[1:07:24] here like you're dead and the water of
[1:07:26] the wood
[1:07:27] make you even rotten faster because
[1:07:29] sitting down into it like a log
[1:07:31] and the water just passing over and
[1:07:32] afterwards is less than this effect
[1:07:34] just said you'll make the gospel of
[1:07:36] non-effect you worship me in vain
[1:07:39] when you begin to understand the
[1:07:40] revelation the calling that god put upon
[1:07:43] your heart and life
[1:07:44] then you want to worship him in spirit
[1:07:46] and in truth
[1:07:47] oh blessed be the name of the lord you
[1:07:48] love him tonight
[1:07:50] oh blessed be the name of the lord i
[1:07:52] will
[1:07:53] close it be cruising shortly but abram
[1:07:58] oh my they begin to act
[1:08:01] different when they receive the holy
[1:08:03] ghost peter and they were afraid the
[1:08:06] doors were shut 120 people in a locker
[1:08:08] room
[1:08:09] waiting for their vaccination waiting
[1:08:11] for something from heaven
[1:08:13] waiting to be inoculated and we know
[1:08:15] when peter came out and the man
[1:08:17] was healed and peter said do you think
[1:08:20] by my strength this man is healed but by
[1:08:22] faith in jesus name this man is healed
[1:08:25] and we know afterwards the devil turned
[1:08:27] over and said no
[1:08:28] we have to stop this bunch of people and
[1:08:30] that's where the press come down they
[1:08:31] say they put some licks on them and beat
[1:08:33] them thinking they will go
[1:08:35] and lick the rooms and pack up shop what
[1:08:37] they did they went to a prayer meeting
[1:08:38] and said lord god strengthen us
[1:08:40] quote your spirit upon us transform us
[1:08:43] anoint our lives
[1:08:44] and god they were refilled with the holy
[1:08:46] ghost and that is the birth of the book
[1:08:49] of acts
[1:08:50] it wasn't the acts of men it wasn't
[1:08:51] yakuza bishops popes
[1:08:53] message popes or otherwise or
[1:08:54] archbishops it was the act of the holy
[1:08:56] ghost and men
[1:08:58] god bring that back philip take me from
[1:09:00] a revival and led
[1:09:02] to speak to the ethiopian people who was
[1:09:04] going back to ethiopia
[1:09:06] to interpret the scriptures empower him
[1:09:08] to go back to his country
[1:09:10] give us where we could be led by the
[1:09:11] spirit of god direct by the spirit of
[1:09:14] god
[1:09:14] no lies god will trade and lies go
[1:09:17] trading truth
[1:09:19] you shall know the truth and the true
[1:09:20] chance that you're free when jesus say
[1:09:23] i come and now you say you see him but
[1:09:25] you don't want to follow true
[1:09:26] you're blind you say but you stay in
[1:09:28] your sins
[1:09:29] because you see once light comes to you
[1:09:32] the choice you have
[1:09:34] is to stay where you are or walk out of
[1:09:36] what you're in
[1:09:37] right now there may be things that you
[1:09:39] need to walk out of
[1:09:41] right now because part of going forward
[1:09:44] is separation
[1:09:45] god will ever leave people where they
[1:09:47] are he pulls them out come out abraham
[1:09:49] come out the country come out from egypt
[1:09:51] come on come on
[1:09:53] if you have to go to the next step the
[1:09:56] next step where god ordained god
[1:09:58] you have to let go to step you are in
[1:10:00] and that step
[1:10:02] is always a fake move because god tells
[1:10:05] abraham come out
[1:10:07] onto a land i will show you so it's not
[1:10:09] that god send them
[1:10:10] the the cadastral and the whole map and
[1:10:12] the whole plan
[1:10:13] it is here from there you walk through
[1:10:15] here like it's a gps thing and when
[1:10:16] you're here turn left and right
[1:10:18] no i will show you so if abraham said
[1:10:21] lord i am moving
[1:10:22] until i get the whole hug the whole
[1:10:26] revelation behold
[1:10:33] i am moving until you have to move
[1:10:36] you have to you have to start with your
[1:10:38] thinking
[1:10:40] if you're thinking don't move you are
[1:10:41] moving you have to start with the
[1:10:43] transformation of your mind if your mind
[1:10:45] don't change you're not moving
[1:10:47] you have to start somewhere let's move
[1:10:51] tonight
[1:10:51] change your thinking rule your chin can
[1:10:54] be
[1:10:55] don't let people who are no god
[1:10:58] who are called who have no degree who
[1:11:01] have no science
[1:11:01] we're not in telling you what to take
[1:11:03] scientifically
[1:11:05] somebody said if the vaccine will cause
[1:11:07] this think about it now
[1:11:08] people talk about the vaccinating market
[1:11:10] the business invert that make any sense
[1:11:12] that is so foolish it doesn't know
[1:11:15] laughing at that you look at them look
[1:11:16] at that
[1:11:17] you see him that is my enemies
[1:11:22] i hope you understand what the vaccine
[1:11:24] is what it does
[1:11:26] it's a lower form of the very same thing
[1:11:29] to activate the antibodies in your body
[1:11:32] to fight
[1:11:32] the disease your body have built in
[1:11:35] action men
[1:11:37] and when they get activated they could
[1:11:39] fight and box and cough and fight back
[1:11:42] but they get activated to generate these
[1:11:45] what they call antibodies
[1:11:47] so when somebody gets vaccinated from
[1:11:49] smallpox or
[1:11:51] whatever it is having oily or whatever
[1:11:52] it is it's something put inside
[1:11:54] to activate antibodies to defend
[1:11:57] themselves from these attacks that's
[1:12:00] what that is about
[1:12:02] and the point about it is this if
[1:12:06] we the body can handle that lower form
[1:12:09] of the
[1:12:09] of the virus that is injected how your
[1:12:12] body will have the full blow
[1:12:14] so to speak that is why i have something
[1:12:16] called vaccination
[1:12:18] they always have anti-vaxxers it have
[1:12:20] people who don't believe in vaccines
[1:12:22] and man and man and a devil and what
[1:12:23] kind of thing like that i
[1:12:25] i can't i can't explain it away from
[1:12:27] people
[1:12:28] everybody have their choice everybody
[1:12:30] have to choose everybody have to
[1:12:32] pray and ask god to help them i know
[1:12:35] somebody gave me a testimony that they
[1:12:36] couldn't really take vaccine because of
[1:12:38] the health condition as a child but god
[1:12:41] kept them all these years and so on that
[1:12:42] is really great
[1:12:44] i cannot i'm not a doctor so when people
[1:12:47] ask me a question that is medical
[1:12:48] i cannot say do this to this forte
[1:12:50] doctor
[1:12:51] get medical i'm not a lawyer if somebody
[1:12:54] have legal issues
[1:12:55] i'm i can't answer certain things i
[1:12:57] don't know everything i'm not good
[1:12:59] you see so you have to have the right
[1:13:01] authority to that
[1:13:02] as i say already some people when the
[1:13:04] doctors say take two pills just show you
[1:13:05] more than three you'll be
[1:13:06] able to doctor but you have to come to
[1:13:09] believe god just like that too
[1:13:11] take your pills and believe god do you
[1:13:13] do and believe god
[1:13:15] go leave god out and just trust science
[1:13:18] but
[1:13:18] understand that god uses science uses
[1:13:21] doctors
[1:13:22] and so on because they really don't heal
[1:13:24] they assist in putting things together
[1:13:26] and so on
[1:13:26] but god is the healer god wants to heal
[1:13:29] you tonight
[1:13:30] question are we closing with this is the
[1:13:33] obama and gilead
[1:13:35] is there no physician there then why
[1:13:39] are my people still sick let us bow
[1:13:42] heads
[1:13:43] oh blessed be the name of the lord
[1:13:46] heavenly father
[1:13:47] i thank you tonight tonight was like a
[1:13:50] different night a special night
[1:13:52] where i fell to talk with your people as
[1:13:55] i would say have a conversation
[1:13:57] to talk with them and to share your word
[1:13:58] with them oh god you took
[1:14:01] ordinary men men that was born in sin
[1:14:04] men there were fishermen that men that
[1:14:06] was
[1:14:07] in charge of tax collecting and who was
[1:14:10] fishermen who was cussing and whatever
[1:14:12] life they were living and you said
[1:14:14] follow me
[1:14:16] little would they have known the
[1:14:19] outcome of the decision to follow the
[1:14:21] messiah
[1:14:23] little that these 12 men that grew but
[1:14:26] have known the gospel would have
[1:14:28] unfolded for seven ages
[1:14:31] and for all these years they are now in
[1:14:34] the dust of the earth
[1:14:36] their bodies that is waiting for this
[1:14:39] capstone bride
[1:14:40] to step forward even job
[1:14:44] when the revelation broke upon him when
[1:14:47] the devil saw an opportunity to strip
[1:14:49] him
[1:14:49] that he would kiss god and the skin
[1:14:52] wounds was eating him
[1:14:54] job raised up with revelation says do
[1:14:57] the skin wound destroy my body yet in my
[1:14:59] flesh
[1:15:00] i shall see god god we
[1:15:04] we don't know what the future holds
[1:15:08] you know and that future is our own
[1:15:11] future
[1:15:12] we know what is prophesied we know
[1:15:16] the vision of what is spoken of at that
[1:15:19] bride
[1:15:20] that should be a haunted persecuted
[1:15:22] group we know
[1:15:24] that every genuine christian every
[1:15:26] genuine believer at some point in time
[1:15:28] will conflict with governments like shah
[1:15:30] jack mitchell
[1:15:31] bendigo like daniel righteous men
[1:15:35] all of them because we know the forces
[1:15:38] of the enemy
