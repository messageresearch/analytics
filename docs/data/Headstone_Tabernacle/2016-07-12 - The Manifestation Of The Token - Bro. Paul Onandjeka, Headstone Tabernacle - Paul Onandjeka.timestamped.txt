[40:55] born the work of the Holy SP today in
[40:58] the
[41:01] church trying to place in the

[41:10] prophets and
[41:13] others and we have the many false
[41:17] alarms and all that happened amongst the
[41:24] people show that the true andine is
[41:27] Drawing
[41:29] Near I believe
[41:33] it is only God who can do the placing in
[41:37] the
[41:38] church it is the business of God not the
[41:42] business of a
[41:43] man it is not a man
[41:47] business a man cannot adopt
[41:52] himself a man cannot say you will be
[41:55] adopted
[41:58] a man cannot say you are a fivefold
[42:01] minister this is only God's
[42:04] business let the redeem say

[42:30] Prophets The Doctor teachers evangelist
[42:36] evangelists not people that are coming
[42:39] from seminaries or
[42:42] from but God will place them in the
[42:47] church there will not be men toss

[43:09] that according to God's own
[43:17] choice ACC that God the Holy Spirit
[43:20] instructed the church and it

[43:46] position that that he has that he has in
[43:50] store for
[43:53] them the position that he has chosen for

[44:00] business a
[44:02] man can choose a deacon a
[44:06] man can choose a
[44:10] user but to choose a fivefold
