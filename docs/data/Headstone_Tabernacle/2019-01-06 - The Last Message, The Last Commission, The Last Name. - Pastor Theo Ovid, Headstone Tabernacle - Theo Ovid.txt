beautiful Ghana hidden from those what poor men minister in a Word of God labor and strive in fighting oh my best tremendous time is South Africa tremendous times in Ghana and God seemed just hand to be upon all eyes and blessing the people that we meet preach true and we just thank the Lord we feel that we are moving in a new season a new journey I don't know about you but coming to this message ninety somebody finds I'd studying a message that's but along in and my heart I see certain things fulfilled and for years you look in looking you know it has to come to pass I was wondering about the press but I'm talking about the press you talk about a hunted persecuted bride you talk about certain things and at that time it looks so far-fetched but not anymore you talk about the advancing technology where their cars was driving up steering wheel and the other day and I'm fingers in London the guy was reading newspapers and the car was driving by itself all these sensors and different things electric cars and so they gave him a ticket got not allowed just yet but the point about it is this things are moving very very quickly to bring us to where we supposed to be and this hour I want to let you know quickly that there's no way you will just sit in church and go into the rapture there's no way you were sick not when a prophet lost his child lost his wife lost the anointing went to his own place of trying that character could be formed in him when he was condemning the woman in the restaurant Gortat and shown his own sins that was forgiven and he is condemning her when he when he has forgiven him and he arose to go past all of that and break into brotherly kindness and break into a nizam of compassion and break into an open door that he could see the way God sees because if we could only see the way God sees this morning our whole lives will be changed our whole lives will be different because we are what we are by the grace of God we didn't earn it we didn't deserve it is the grace of God so stop being arrogant stop being puffed up understand that you are what you are but for the grace of God if God didn't keep you you would have fallen if God didn't hold you you would have been lost if God didn't seek after you you would not have been found but for the goodness of God oh we should be grateful and thankful when we walk into the house of God careful in our hearts what we should be often illiterate praises and Thanksgiving what are you complaining about you woke up this morning activity in limbs if your body of pain is they feeling something the people like that can't feel anything but you see learn something this morning I wanted to feel to live I want you to feel to overcome I wanted to feel I shall be victorious or glory and I want you to feel that that you have good success I wanted to feel that that this year is your year if ever a year was no year is one nine nineteen to test here's your year I'm believing that this morning I guess in theory final the sea of supernatural breakthrough this is where the line is forming outside the church but blind hog leading people coming to be prayed for this is that year this is the end of the prophecy more glory in a court of miracles and powers at sight it'll be fulfilled we have to believe that that's the core of the vision and the vision is of God it's cut to come to pass exactly [Music] the air your family being delivered your family being delivered I am in come to church delivered I am in command come to service diplomat the whole cha hell broke off for them the pans broken off for them hopefully they're gonna be talking about delivered to many undelivered people sitting in this message they holdin on hang in there Denis deliverance deliverance is deliverance deliverance give you your freedom my god after saving force fearful how much hundreds of years you know what is good to be drifting over Egypt knowing advance I got no bit more more you know I've been no picture more you're not the toys for the devil the more you like to smoke no more you'll have to pipe up no more getting off the booze no more free pass maybe ceasing all glory that God yeah we have prayer I said and some sick heal some sick not Elim what not we're not talking about Jesus he's all manner of sicknesses all manner of diseases when Jesus walking disease trembling when Jesus Jesus walking disease shaking in their boots even the dead casted dead men Jesus around if the dead are not weakened praise God hallelujah praise God I will be talking about and he's the same yesterday today and forever he can't be that yesterday and not that today he's the same yesterday never ever we want that same Jesus we don't want the modern Jesus we don't know I can prove version Jesus will explain in Jesus we want the same one more in the only church he will not say one back in this church nor a Jesus says we would see Jesus [Applause] I want to see the same power of love sin forgiveness it's a power you look the Pharisees and scribes the cat has outlawed ever the cat humor sick they just talk in wood no power no anointing I'm challenging the Messiah Moses see this woman caught in the very act of adultery should be strong what you see they taught us and just poke you see in them if Moses see that let's go do it if you were talk to him just to what Moses say if you made out sin those guys had to walk away because they know they was just as guilty as that woman maybe not about you but other things because the Hat is what speaks back to you your hat is what condemn you is out of the abundance of your hat that define you what comes on inside idea will you the world won't you doctor change for you not a thought for you that's why he released Jesus to come and deliver you goddess will is much into hell you may not think that but a balance all the makeup all the mascara all the pink pieces he saw it in hell when he saw it on the earth he say hell has come up to the it so all them tattoos and all I'm thinking doing the wind and air in here and this side here what kind of stuff is on hell but heaven also came down and heaven consists of the will and a power cane don't heal the sick and raise the dead cast out Devils and when God took that prophet he didn't take the power I don't care what power let's the message you would look like but did not take the power took the prophet but not the power took the prophet but not the angel he took the prophet but not the Holy Ghost or glory not God the whole verses here the angel is here the word is here Loreena thought you know when I said the angel is here the Holy Ghost is here and don't put this here do anything about what God is about to do or glory not God he should have done it a long time ago if you wanted to kill you should I kill you a long time ago it's just too late it is just too late if you wanted to be back soon you should imagine a long time ago it's too late now Ian come to hell but nothing we're gonna talk about you Ellen all these years but today will be a different day you need don't breeze going on Oh glory to God hallelujah it's all scan breeze gone I love you I love that's what cars resale I love you [Music] what Oh [Music] [Applause] [Music] I love you in the red one I love you [Music] [Music] [Music] I love you [Music] we're gonna turn our Bibles to thank you positions marked up to 16 and also we wanna read from this 50 to 20 we want to read revelation 10 1 2 7 and revelation 13:1 50 of us each on a tank the assistant possible isaacman the lanthanum welders who'll in the fort our absence we certainly appreciate it amen so reading from mark 16 verse 15 and he said unto them go ye into all the world and preach the gospel to every creature he was believed in as baptized shall be saved either believeth not shall be damned these signs shall follow them that believe in my name is cast out Devils they shall speak with new tongues they shall take up serpents and if they drink any deadly thing it shall not hurt them they shall lay hands on the sick condition recover so then after the Lord had spoken unto them he was received up into heaven and sat on the right hand of God and they went forth and preached everywhere the Lord working with them and confirming the word with signs following amen he's not interested the Lord was receivable to heaven sat at the right hand of God and they ran for everywhere the Lord working with them confirming the word side that's interesting relation 10 is one on a mighty angel come down from heaven clothed with a cloud and a rainbow was upon his head his face was where the Sun is feet as fit as a fire he had his hand a little book open said it's right foot up on the Seas left foot on it is and cried with a loud voice when a landlord and when it cried seven thunders uttered a voices and when the seven thunders uttered a voices of the porter bright yet a voice I've never seen it to me seat up those things which the seven thunders uttered and write them not in the injuries I saw stand upon this see upon it lifted up his hand or heaven and swear by him that liveth for ever and ever who created heaven among the things that are there now on the earth and the things that therein are the sea and the things which are therein are that there should be here we go time no longer in other words time runs out but in the days of the voice the seventh angel when he shall begin to song the mystery of God should be finished as he hath declared to his servants the prophets revelation chapter 13 verse 8 and all that dwell upon the earth shall worship Him whose names are not written in the book of life of the lamb slain from the foundation of the world let's play one more time father we thank you for your Holy Scriptures and father only you could put this together father I just have some things written here but Lord put it together for your sheep that their lives would be so affected by a word that will transform them into that would image that you promised granted father and GC my asketh amen you may be seated but have a title this morning and it sort of struck me while I was overseas and we kind of prepared for

somebody else come believe and go and tell somebody dollars now we know first Thessalonians 4:16 the Lord Himself you sent a man with a shout that shot was but a Varma's message of seven seasons and thunders that show poetry kind of believers believe it or not not one kind but three times so this shout message brought a mixed multitude and that's about to change because many are called by the shout but few are chosen like the voice or glory their God I want you to be one of those chosen ones hallelujah ones who see the name on that book that will belong to the short message but get call by the voice because that voice come in the coil is very old do you believe that the goddess of orders separate the men from the boys do that one discipline those that want to come into the order and

friend they had what first they have the word second a prophet injured leader everyone agreed with the other God told Abraham I see Chaz's in a strange land and with a mighty hand I bring them out that was the word yet commences they come the prophet and after the Prophet yet on the angel but course in the world I said no black eye for Elijah the Prophet God he has already come last already come he took the profit off no we have the angel and the engine and the Prophet on the world must say the same thing they will not treat with the same thing that's why the president of Spirit the

that we have to go back to Eden we have to go back to the spirit of us back in Eden and that spirit was Adam an away at all don't want to release your spirit upon you that you could be like him to go after your fallen brother go ask your fallen sister there are many people this message befallen the bustling did dad didn't have equipment power that was going pointing along your life but Lana's

prophesied my loved ones are coming out [Applause] the precision the word the profit ninja all three of them together Brom says that when the supernatural is done a mixed module come out super have been done metal and the officers a USC MIT small to do dinner with much all done lucify himself the same spirits when they see manifestations is Laura Chechen word word word word here bother even any operable Bram says when they stagger the devil in moving on epicenter overexcited man this nagging like jock manner these people not you're supposed but this is that let the Prophet Joe well speak up the only simply to move like he drunk the fellows a lonely excited they get something in your money excited about it there was too much you see news alum and makeup and sleep but when and the crippled man like everybody know this has not been pretending to be ill everybody movie crippled and Peter says seven gold such as I have this is same cost but Peter this is same denying Jesus Peter this is same same Peter not another piece a beta everybody know Peter and everybody know that man but when he says as such as I have I give it up to you rise up and walk in the name of Jesus Christ when that man walk could ever say all this is serious this is very serious it look like this same Jesus that was crucified is no back in power blowing of God Jesus is back in town the decision which Jesus did abaca kill now you want a pizza you want an Andrew the one in Paul be one in James the one in Stephen because Jesus did that power fire divided it and give himself give each person a little portion of a spear what the devil to do when we get together this fire this fire this fire coming together fire being recreated no one in the Church of the Living God leads to power the tips in and throw it away in the Church of the Living God is the power to heal the sick and to cast out devils give the Lord a shout [Applause] maybe season I know this challenges where you are this challenges oh you are this challenge is what go choose your mind what could you name can you not not seeing yourself there but you will because Peter and Andrew and channel all these brothers they were not seen themselves there they were ordinary folks like you and I fishermen and tax collector but they had a porter Lord and their mind had to change so Jesus had to introduce to them the torch from the kingdom my father working I work on so if this kingdom my kingdom was of this world my men would fight for me my kingdom is from above he's trying to bring me my order because as I all have more power in it but it's order on here you are limited or glory has got you a limited because you have to get money to buy your bread but in this kingdom you could break bread and multiply it please a higher order in this year yeah they're going call back to zero at home because somebody drop dead but in this kingdom you can raise the dead so this is a higher order in that King on the other one picked up the bills but then this day come there is no sickness he can't conquer there's no devil he can't remove because it's a higher order give your push to the high order now glow in the park he says seek first the kingdom of God and His righteousness and every other thing shall be added unto you [Applause] [Music] [Applause] change a mindless model change your mind your lose friends will get more if your people reject you you'll get a new people the country kick your do you belong to that country because it's in the couldn't get a promise and eat Egypt you know Messiah was promised me autonomy Messiah was promised and Kenan land if it was a place and that the Jimmy to that man the journey is not the promise you going to pressure that's not a promise keep on don't stop if you have to water water but don't stop every place you put your food not yours [Applause] so if you raise your hand this morning you are cleaning up groans the memory isn't on yet and there is a new clay minerals you showed this morning you get a good hallelujah you are gaming groans because you have to find the devil and we take one to tell you frustration depression Russia you can't show how much all of that from a natural standpoint but when you could under your pressure he says hallelujah mijo under your depression your system yeah catch him in this morning but the name on the book I was a cow am i right but we move on the book I mean enough food on my table but my name is on my book and you can sign your name yes hit'em because your name is not there you'll be seated one time sideways come back happy rejoicing Deborah gist subject to them and Jesus catch them off-guard he said they rejoice because there was running from him because reality is the anointing we put on them that them devil seen and taken off these have rejoiced because your name is written tell them what to rejoice about you lose wife whose husband you lose trying and Roussel to lose this you lose your job you lose your pair they get a

all of God's people or glory in a car because this is a ditch where the mystery is me a clean and go I have not given us the spirit of fear but the spirit of power the spirit of love and i'ma show me without crazy we have a showman with no and we we have believe we're not stupid we're not Moochie hallelujah are we not crazy we are solid on that word we know in whom we have believed that is a Holy Ghost promise he said I will not leave you comfortless I'm gonna come to you the other promise of another comforter whom the world cannot receive but you are seeing him because he is with you and shall be in you [Applause] Hey oh boy Oh God you may be seasoned Jesus tell them clean me if I don't go comfort that cannot come so if you want to hold on to me you have to let go at some point in time you have to let me go or get the Lord a shock or blow in a gun mile um no feel like preaching you said if I don't go the comforter will not come but my he was telling because in this form I am just with you but to fulfill the Commission I have to turn in you because my dad was original intent was to be abuzz with and in do you get that God's original purpose and intent was to come from being above wit to come in so the Fatherhood cold and pure fire what above us word made flesh bored with us but spirit in you that's what in you you mean toward cause coming to leave you mean court could coming to you you mean you to get caught in sign are you these happen yes [Applause] [Music] glory say every place that you put the sole of your feet I have given you for possession it's time

angelic visitation angel and God commented I bet the church this is another ordinary bunch of people this is a covenant people come on with blood I once there is blood the spirit oh when I pluck you

wanna feel thee as I was Moses I will be with you no man shall be able to stand before thee all the days of my life so Moses was not permitted to take the children over because he failed Moose's field he only brought him up to the land and the church organization has filled they will not take the church over God will raise up a new system and I declare that system has been raised up 92019 go on a reason new system listen to what he said here in prophecy an interdenominational system by the power of God so nobody can lock down the anointing and say we have it nobody else have it that's nonsense

raise up a new system an interdimensional system by the power of God there are some people who upset that we are fellowship and on talking with other groups or other pastors other ministers they

the scripture the spirit and the bride say come the bride becomes the world the Spirit comes upon the brain and gives the brand of voice once more the woman's a tigress from God once more the woman

service continues this evening at 3 p.m. doors will open at 2:30 p.m. for the Lord's Supper so 3 p.m. doors open at 2:30 p.m. for the Lord's Supper service continues on Wednesday of this week at 7:30 p.m. as the first midweek service of this year so we encourage you to make every effort to come out this Wednesday at 7:30 p.m. this coming Thursday brother Ovid has been invited to preach at Ephesians Tabernacle that's what a Ratan's George church so the george has asked us to give a head count of those who would come on thursday night so we have put brother Clarence responsible for that head count so if you are interested in going on for that service at Ephesians Tabernacle this coming Thursday when we'll be ministering there but a rotten short church please give your name to Berta Clarence after this service maintenance group 4 please meet with brother Benjamin kindly after the service this evening point to note on Saturday January 26 I'm saying it now just so you have duty notice will be our first youth service youth oriented service of 2019 Saturday January 26 at 5 p.m. so marketing your calendars we will continue to repeat this announcement and as we would have said before it's used oriented all are welcome and for those who would have been in our youth services in the latter part of last year our youth services are very unique we don't preach in those services we have a conversation with the young people we take questions we answer questions we deal with current issues current challenges 245 the young people and by extension the entire church in such a time as this it's a great opportunity to learn from one another and to search through this and the prophets message with how to not just survive but overcome and thrive and succeed as as God wants us to so last and certainly not least if you are interested in volunteering we are looking for some volunteers to support the maintenance teams in the church so if you are interested in supporting the main Tina's efforts for the different groups and I really want to salute brother Steven for the vision of how this is managed the way it's done it's not a continuing or every week burden it's it's five or it's five or six it's six groups that rotate every six weeks and you have a responsibility to ensuring that God's house is kept in order so this way over the rotation cycle it's once every month and a half or so but you are on duty and this way the burden and the responsibility is shared as we work together for the kingdom of God amen as we went into 2019 is really about us getting more involved in supporting what God wants done and I truly believe in my heart that we who are here firstfruits for our families and for our loved ones who are coming brother Branham taught us that you know there are some people who they wouldn't come to church or see what happens here but you're our lives as we go out to them we'll be a testimony to reach to them you know and real Christianity is about service real Christianity is about living for other people and beloved Minister today the last message the last Commission the last name we encourage to go beyond our comfort zone your blessing always lies outside of your comfort zone but a random piece of message beyond the camp going beyond the camp their blessing always lies beyond your comfort zone where you go away of not going before so in this year I challenge you to put your shoulder to the wheel as a word helped in Samaria and we certainly looking for help in the maintenance area right now so just to recap once again service is evening at
