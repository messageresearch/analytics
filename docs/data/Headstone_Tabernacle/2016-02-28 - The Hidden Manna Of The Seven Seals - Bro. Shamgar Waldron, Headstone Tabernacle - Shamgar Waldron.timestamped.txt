[1:30:00] Plan of
[1:30:02] Redemption he wrote it in a Sevenfold
[1:30:05] manner
[1:30:06] sir he wrote the book of redemption in a
[1:30:10] Sevenfold mystery can many say
[1:30:13] Amen the prophet says a
[1:30:16] Sevenfold mystery Plan of
[1:30:20] Redemption it's a plan that God planed
[1:30:24] but he wrote it in a Sevenfold
[1:30:27] manner to hide it from the eyes of the
[1:30:30] wise and
[1:30:32] prudent they might read it but don't
[1:30:35] understand
[1:30:36] it amen amen
[1:30:40] friend praise the name of the
[1:30:43] Lord because it's sealed up and sealed

[1:30:57] Believers can we say
[1:31:00] amen amen hallelujah now you watch some
[1:31:04] of the wisdom that goes with the
[1:31:07] Revelation and uh when he wrote the book
[1:31:11] there are prophets in there all over the
[1:31:14] book the whole Bible is full of
[1:31:17] prophets and you know them you can call
[1:31:19] them Isaiah Ezekiel whatever you want to
[1:31:21] call n whoever amen friends it is full
[1:31:25] of prophets in the bible and Isaiah as I

[1:31:32] great prophets in the
[1:31:33] bible
[1:31:35] amen because we are told that he wrote
[1:31:38] have 66
[1:31:40] chapters Amen in Isaiah and there are 66
[1:31:44] books in the
[1:31:46] Bible
[1:31:47] amen but though he was a great prophet
[1:31:50] like many
[1:31:51] others you find that God
[1:31:54] a sort of a a single out three of them
[1:31:59] three prophets in the bible in
[1:32:01] particular that God single out to do
[1:32:04] certain things can we say
[1:32:07] amen
[1:32:09] amen and one of them was
[1:32:13] Moses and he singled out
[1:32:17] Moses and uh call him to write the first
[1:32:21] five books of the Old test
[1:32:25] which the rest of the books in the Old
[1:32:27] Testament is based on those first five
[1:32:30] books
[1:32:32] amen and that was Moses to write them
[1:32:37] amen and over in the New
[1:32:40] Testament he took the prophet
[1:32:43] [Applause]
[1:32:45] Paul to write the Epistles to the New
[1:32:49] Testament amen you see Paul writing to
[1:32:53] the church at Cent and different ones
[1:32:55] and wherever they were scattered am amen
[1:32:59] it is Paul that wrote those Epistles and
[1:33:02] do you believe that Paul was a prophet
[1:33:04] he was a prophet
[1:33:06] amen
[1:33:09] amen and the third Prophet is your
[1:33:18] Prophet amen so he took Moses to write
[1:33:23] the book books of the Old along with the
[1:33:26] other prophets amen and then it took
[1:33:29] Paul to write the Books of the new so
[1:33:32] that's what make the
[1:33:34] Bible old and new amen so this is old
[1:33:40] and this is
[1:33:41] new and then when you bring them
[1:33:44] together both old and new it make one
[1:33:47] Canon of scriptures one
[1:33:50] book that is how your Bible is
[1:33:55] amen and then God sealed the whole thing
[1:34:00] with seven seeds can we say praise the
[1:34:03] name of the
[1:34:06] Lord
[1:34:08] amen amen friend the entire book the
[1:34:13] whole Cannon of scriptures was sealed up
[1:34:17] with Seven Seals on the back side of the
[1:34:21] book praise the name of the Lord
[1:34:25] amen and
[1:34:26] amen so he took Moses to ride the old
[1:34:30] yes sir and he took Paul to write the
[1:34:34] new do you agree with
[1:34:36] that amen but the whole thing there was
[1:34:40] wrote
[1:34:42] mysterious it was wrote in symbols sir
[1:34:47] it was wrote in
[1:34:49] types it was wrote In
[1:34:52] Shadows it it was wrote in
[1:34:55] Parables it was wrote in wles can we say
[1:34:59] Amen do you believe that
[1:35:02] friend Paul wrote a lot of things in
[1:35:05] Mysteries is that right friend praise
[1:35:08] the name of the Lord you see that's the
[1:35:11] reason why the theologians and them get
[1:35:13] in trouble
[1:35:14] today amen because they can't understand
[1:35:18] the way it's wrote mysterious the book
[1:35:21] can we say amen hallelujah amen
[1:35:23] Hallelujah because it's wrote in symbols
[1:35:26] some wrote Parts is wrote In Time like
[1:35:29] the Book of Revelation that is only a
[1:35:30] book of
[1:35:31] symbols there's nothing wrote just
[1:35:34] outright like
[1:35:35] that but there are things that symbolize
[1:35:38] there like the seven gold and
[1:35:39] candlesticks and things like that
[1:35:41] symbolize the church can we say amen
[1:35:45] hallelujah is that right friend then you
[1:35:48] get Paul writing some of the Epistles in
[1:35:50] in the New Testament and he wrote them
[1:35:53] in Mysteries or for instance he say
[1:35:56] behold I show you a mystery we shall not
[1:35:59] all sleep but we shall all be changed
[1:36:02] can we say Amen is that right and some
[1:36:06] of the Mysteries the way he wrote it he
[1:36:09] particularly tell the people I don't
[1:36:12] want you to be
[1:36:14] ignorant of this
[1:36:17] mystery that blindness has happened to
[1:36:19] Israel can we say
[1:36:21] Amen is that right friend so you see
[1:36:24] it's Mysteries there in the New
[1:36:27] Testament amen and
[1:36:29] amen and then after God listen after God
[1:36:34] had
[1:36:35] Paul and had
[1:36:37] Moses both of them had the same
[1:36:40] experience seeing the pillar of fire can
[1:36:43] me say
[1:36:45] Amen it wasn't just wrote by education
[1:36:48] of man it wasn't just wrote by
[1:36:50] understanding of man it was inspired can
[1:36:53] we say Amen all the word of God is
[1:36:57] inspired how many agree with that say
[1:36:59] Amen all all all Every Word is
[1:37:04] [Applause]
[1:37:05] inspired all scripture was given by
[1:37:09] inspiration of God Amen and it's
[1:37:12] profitable for you is that right friend
[1:37:16] so after all the old was wrote and there
[1:37:19] was a time that the old was closing and
[1:37:22] there is a time that new have to be
[1:37:24] closed too can we say amen amen then God
[1:37:27] take the boat two halves go this is one
[1:37:32] half old this is another half new and
[1:37:35] God put the two halves
[1:37:37] together to make the whole
[1:37:40] book
[1:37:41] amen then he put Seven Seals around it
[1:37:45] on the back side of it can we say Amen
[1:37:49] is that right so here this Moses wrote
[1:37:52] the old Paul wrote the new but the whole
[1:37:55] things was seal
[1:37:57] up amen the whole thing was seal up so
[1:38:01] that nobody can know what those
[1:38:02] Mysteries are
[1:38:04] inside so we needed another
[1:38:12] Prophet Moses wrote it Paul wrote it God
[1:38:16] seal it up then we needed another
[1:38:18] Prophet to reveal it
[1:38:24] and there is where brother Brown
[1:38:26] Ministry come
[1:38:28] in to reveal the thing can we say
