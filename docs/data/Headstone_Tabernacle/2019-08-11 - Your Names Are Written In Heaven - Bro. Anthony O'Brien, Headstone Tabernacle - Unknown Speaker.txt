what a song service completion of a man feel the anointing here I didn't come to sing but I felt like singing you might only uh [Music] bless you man it's good to feel the presence of God this morning the man thank you so much musicians a mango blessing our church has 1012 Bibles amen and you want to read a few portion scripture man gonna greet you in the precious name of our Lord amen and I propose a script I want to read from three portions first we want to read from the book of Saint Luke chapter 10 and then we want to go to a Revelation chapter 12 and after that we go to first John chapter 3 and verse 1 but let's do in first to Luke chapter 10 Luke chapter 10 and God gives a mission to his disciples gives them power to go out and heal the sick and cast out devils and different things but we want to skip down to the 17 there's a little feedback here address st. John st. Luke 10 and 17 we want to read from this morning and it speaks of the return of these seventy who God has anointed a man who Jesus anointed 17 it says and the seventy returned again with joy saying Lord even the Devils are subject unto us through thy name and he said unto them I beheld Satan as lightning fall from heaven behold I give unto you power to tread on serpents and scorpions and over all the power of the enemy and nothing shall by any means hurt you notwithstanding in this rejoice not that the spirits are subject unto you but rather rejoice because your names are written in heaven and in that our Jesus rejoice in the spirit and said I thank thee O Father Lord of Heaven and Earth that thou has hid these things from the wise and prudent and has revealed them unto babes even so father for it seemed good in thy scent all things are delivered to me of my father and no man knoweth who the son is but the father and who the father is but the son and hear this and he whom the son will review him that's you this morning amen and he turned unto he turned him unto his disciples and said privately blessed are the eyes which see the things that easy for I tell you that many prophets and Kings have desired to see those things which you see and have not seen them and to hear those things which you hear and have not hid them oh that's a reason to celebrate this morning Oh hallelujah not many could see it but God predestinated us to see it this morning Amen now turn over to Revelation chapter 12 email also a few contacts scriptures here before we revelation 1207 a man before three one more time a man revelation 12 and verse 7 and there was a war in heaven Michael and his angels fought against the Dragon and the dragon fought and his angels and prevailed not neither was their found any more phone anymore in heaven and the Great Dragon was cast out that old serpent called the devil and Satan which deceiveth the whole world he was cast out into the earth and his angels were cast out with him and I heard a loud voice saying in heaven now is come salvation and strength and the Kingdom of our Lord and the power of his Christ for the accuser of our brethren is cast down which accused them before our God day and night and they overcame him talking about you this morning by the blood of the Lamb and by the word of their testimony and they loved not their lives unto the death therefore rejoice ye heavens and ye that dwell in them woe to the inhabiters of the earth and of the sea for the devil is come down unto you having great wrath because he knoweth that he hath but a short time o even so come Lord Jesus a man now really go for it First Epistle of John epistle of John chapter 3 he meant just one piece there this one saying behold what manner of love the father had bestowed upon us that we should be called the sons of God therefore the world knoweth knoweth us not because it knew him not we got our blessing to the ring of his rule let's bow hit one more time for with a prayer Oh gracious have any father Lord you are Lord such a powerful God this morning LOI thank you for your presence but we thank you for your love that has projected to us and these last days long that we could see you Father Lord you said a little while in the world will see me no more Lord will see you father because you live we shall live also so father we thank you for these precious promises you give your bride in his last day and now as we turn over to the wood portion of your service Lord we pray that the presence will come down in a special way lon know me and speak to our hearts father Lord we want to hear from you this morning but we didn't come to see anyone or to Lord and that kind of a way father but lo we come to meet with Jesus so Lord we take everything we move everything aside on all of our isms or schisms lon everything that Lord Father duck easily be sent us Lord Lord and we want to plug into the anointing of God this morning through worship and praise and create an atmosphere lon so that your wood could drop down and minister to every heart Lord a minister to every life Lord take me out of the way loyal and high behind your cross Lord father take my words Lord take this little message here Lord that you have inspired to my heart I love me a blessed tear people father low Mia say what you want said and do what you want done this morning Lord we give ourselves over to you as willing vessels lon and you could use this for your own unfair glory grant us now write this now Lord we pray Lord air your presence fill this place and have your preeminence this morning we pray in Jesus name Amen and amen go bless the church Jim and Mary seats amen amen amen please go on Eman so it's a privilege to be here this morning Amen in the presence of the Lord amen amen hallelujah it's good to be in his presence you know we wouldn't always have this time gather like this but we thank God for the time we pray that God blesses time of pries this time of the would a man priests gone we so thankful a man and we know that the meetings going on in Nigeria different places and the pastor's Day and so on and know that God is blessing the people and anointing his bride a man for one more ride amen as the Prophet had promised and so we thank God for all these things and we continue to remember the pastor in prayer this morning and so praise God as I believe it my lot this morning to a minister the would've you this would have got to you this morning amen so we endeavor to do so by the grace of God in man God has given us in these last days a man so thankful to brother Isaac off we go bless you brother amen Sen appreciate our message preached you mean entanglement it may I was going over to my mind he made praise God and I was bringing some of it on the Wednesday night service we had just Wednesday going and he-man real blessing to us a man so thank God for his ministry his place here among I see man to stay with the word he meant to stay with what are the prophecies that are written in this book why because the time is at hand the time is at hand for your deliverance the time is at hand for your breakthrough the time is at hand for your freedom the time is at hand for the shackles to be broken the time will at hand for the backsliders to be restored the time is at hand for every seed that God spoken to me in the beginning to come forth in his last name not one shall be left behind oh do you believe it this morning a man so have a title my title is your names are written in heaven amen amen hallelujah that's my title this morning a many man your names are written in heaven and my subject is who God is who you are and who the devil is a many man yeah yeah so this is why we come this morning we come to worship we come to praise gone because we have a revelation of our names being written in heaven and here it was the disciples a man were given power a man to tread upon serpents and scorpions isn't that right I'll follow the devil's isn't that right temporary power he-man Halle isn't that right Bobo bravado is called Matthew 10 power a man isn't a right and so here they come back now and they baby baby they were rejoicing they were having a blast they were having a revival they were having a jubilee amen over the things that they have seen happen holiday is now right hallelujah we having a revival in their own way man isn't that right they were enjoying the fruits of the land hallelujah and here it was a man they come to Jesus and he said unto Him Jesus look he say even the Devils are subject unto us through thy name hallelujah what a wonderful thing hallelujah to see the devil's running and screaming hallelujah they see this great revival being rolled hallelujah cord was in charge he was a captain Holland they were his servants rolling out his commands a man in a hollowed-out it felt good no doubt it felt glorious what a glorious time they were having all right what a worship time worship felt easy brother because the demons were running and screaming hallelujah hallelujah but Jesus told them don't rejoice because of these things that you see around you don't let that dictate your worship oh don't get caught up in that look at the things you can't see look at the reason why turn your attention over to what God is doing to what God has done because before the beginning before the foundation of the world before he had done anything he wrote your names town in the Lamb's Book of Life that's the reason that you have power over the enemy that's the reason the cripples are walking that's the reason the blind is seeing but gospel being preached in his power hallo Leute because God has a pride somewhere God has a people somewhere for his name's sake he was gonna bring them out Oh hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah oh and that's why we come this morning with all our hearts open before the throne of God we come to lift up our hands we come to shouts and keep gonna praise because our names are written in heaven we wouldn't have made it if he didn't choose us we wouldn't have come this far if it wasn't for the grace of Almighty God I have a reason this morning to smile and to lift my hands in the presence of the Almighty because he chose you and or change you to bring forth fruit hallelujah Oh glory when the people begin to realize that Messiah is in the image they come a point in time when they could no more hold their silence when they could no more hold their peace they found what they could find they found palm branches and they laid it down before the Messiah as he was riding into the city Oh hallelujah praise God glory to God Oh singing Hosanna Hosanna Oh blessed be the rock of our salvation blessed be the Lord Accord on my teeth who wasn't is and it's a comma the Pharisees couldn't see them the scribes can see what's all this noise about who you are not [Applause] everybody could see this well is now takes revelation it takes him who the son of man would reveal himself unto you reveal it himself to whomsoever he will and he pipe a secret he bypassed the mighty and he come unto babes and sucklings learn oh badger skins God would hide himself in simplicity Oh hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah all that you know what don't need that go don't need your education when Cora's ready to call Moses out you kill one man I run away I'm God left Moses and the backside of the desert for 40 years prophet said 40 years 40 years temptation Oh Holly left him in the back there for 40 years to drain the education out of him to beat the self are the words out of him to beat all the pride to beat all the lust to be taller he thought he was all that he was supposed to care about it hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah Oh and everyday he was getting more ready forgot to use him the slaves might have wanted him to come right now but goal was already yes it wasn't time yet he had a servant there gettin beat out getting training for the job Oh hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah and then all of a sudden when God was ready when cold looked at his watch when God looked at the time we realized that the promise that he made that he would bring a deliverer on it was almost close at hand it was almost close at time and he said I heard the cries of my people Oh hallelujah the people begin to call God servant into action the people something is not register there was a car I made a promise one time my people shall sojourn in a strange land but with a mighty hand I would bring them out he made that promise unto their fathers Abraham was in the wilderness and look what I made a promise they knew that God was able to deliver them from this situation and I don't care this morning what situation you are in what trial I am what pressure you are now the chorus that is able the court made a promise he is gonna meet you at the point of your need don't you limit God is able to respond this morning Hillary for he's still away maker miracle worker promise keeper light in the darkness that is my god this morning [Applause] the shop [Applause] [Music] [Applause] hallelujah hallelujah glory glory according man I got a reason to shout I got a reason to smile in the travel space he's the accuser of the Brethren but he don't know this because before the beginning we was there and we kicked him out in heaven are we gonna kick him out down here oh man oh come on now it's not the book of James a Bible said they'd never believe and tremble now it never knows a lot of stuff never could cut the Bible up and put it back together but tense over this preacher my degrees have come on Sunday evening that the devil could almost preach a message perfectly hallelujah is now right but there's a secret that God hid in the back part of his mind that he didn't tell the devil about that's why he could look at job and say have you considered my servant because the devil was looking at what you're had and failed to recognize that there was something he did not see because the devil could mess with your mind he could mess with your human spirit but tongue inside a heart well he can't mess with that tongue inside there God put something something that holds arranged something that's there in the trial in the testing in the persecution God hid a secret oh hung inside your soul and that is a reason why no matter what dross the devil throw at you what scum the devil threw in your direction something inside of your soul is smaller because it comes a little him it raises back up again and raises your hands up again you find a reason in the midst of your million sorrows you find one reason why you should come to church this morning you still find one reason why you could shout why you could sing why you can lift your hands tell the reason this morning what is the secret the bird is in the pride and your names are written in heaven [Applause] glory to glory to glory to God hallelujah hallelujah lift up your head this morning he is a lift top of my head Oh peanut the Lord says for who we are a team from the hand of the enemy Oh you being in the hands of the enemy it's only temporary that's only temporary don't look at temporary things but look at the permanent things your name is written in heaven Oh hallelujah pretty legit you took his old blood and wrote your name in it oh yeah that's a reason a shout that's a reason to shake the shingles this morning [Music] [Applause] halleluyah halleluyah this morning lose yourself in the presence of God this morning lose yourself in the Word of God or hide yourself in the cleft or rock and its presence is small and you begin to lift your hands and reconnect with your sonship with your torture ship reconnect this morning I wake who God says you are Oh hallelujah hallelujah we connect this morning Oh turn your Wi-Fi on holiday is a signal out there to connect with the signal in here that lets you know that you are son you are taught of the Most High God you don't have to leave here the same you could leave here with the Holy Ghost God give a cheer called hallelujah he promised it to you oh it's yours this morning [Applause] no wonder the Bible say I'm fully persuaded there's no death but principalities no power no satanic force no weapon formed against you shall prosper I'm fully persuaded that neither death nor life Oh hallelujah praise God nothing will separate us from the love of God God loved you so much and he looked for the greatest treasure he could find and the only one he could find was a treasure of his own heart and when love protected itself love had a name and a name was Jesus and he came down and fought for you and paid the price for you hallelujah we didn't deserve it but he loved you anyhow he didn't deserve it but he called you anyhow he chose you anyhow oh that oughta make you shut up I haven't got started yet my I see Lucifer's lightning coming down from heaven that's what he said here right hmm I beheld Satan lightning falling from heaven all right disciples rejoicing having a wonderful time yes Jesus with this spooky message a man but it point back to the real truth he was trying to point them back to the real picture what's really taking place see the devil come down and we read about it at a war in heaven in Revelation 12 is now right Michael and his angels fought and a dragon and his angels fought against them and it was no place found for the dragon so they kicked him out but it's not right because the dragon wanted to worship the dragon want a little praise the dragon wanted all the glory and Michael said no you can't have it as long as I'm here you won't can't you can't have it you have no pup with me and I've no pop at him and they fought well and there was a war going on and that war is still taking place right now isn't that right that dragon still wants worship this morning open your eyes to recognize and the cares of this life the attraction is to try to pull you away from giving call all of your heart all of your soul all of your strengths and all of your minds well hallelujah is to pull you away from true worship but the hour coming now is when the true worshipers are gonna worship the father in spirit and in truth Oh hallo that's coming our when we are gonna worship the father spirit and truth we'll be together in the church and then we be worshiping the Living Christ him moving in and out among us all indicating himself making himself real and if God was a healer certain somebody and there's no hindrances to the floor the spirits but caught to move in anytime and heal the sick among us and raise the dead and cast out Devils Oh hallelujah Oh glory to God that is what he had in the early church in a man is not right honey not a leaf he's in church or at a church with Jesus walking in though he was dead doing witness work he was witness of them 30 40 days and went up a man a man was resurrected I went back it meant to beat his father in heaven his spirits come down for a witness to say that God is not dead but the same Jesus who you slew and hung on a tree is here much doing the same works he did when he was here on earth healing the sick raising the dead casting out Devils brother that's the kind of Jesus but I want to see in this last day we don't want no people testimony we want a real testimony we want to live in Fitch I live in reality of court among us Oh God moving in and out of us Oh hallelujah halleluyah halleluyah he's got to be real inside of you hallelujah amen amen cause when he's real you know you can go into trial you know you could go through the test because there's something greater in you than the test that you're about to face there's something creature inside of you there's a reason why girls don't do like other birds there's a reason why when the storm is coming and other birds are flying away they seek refuge in the trees they seek refuge in the valleys but not the eagle the eagle has something inside of him he knows he could fly right through the eye of the storm he's built to take the pressure hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah I won the devil gets ready to pour the dynamics of his power into his setup that he has down here it's his world council of churches and all these things he's got set up when the devil is ready to move into that system the bride has got to know that she has something inside of her that's pressurized to take the heat Oh hallelujah hallelujah glory to caught the devil cannot cut us off where was how when I lay the foundations of you when the morning stars sang together I went a front of God shouted for joy God's good pleasure was to choose you Oh Oh God smile when he chose you when he wrote your name and blood you knew you was gonna make it he knew you was gonna overcome he knew you was gonna choose that's math that you have chosen and because that has chosen the hard way the narrow way oh brother a huge portion of heaven awaits you my master there's a greater purpose it's something you can't see it's like the roots of the tree you look at the tree and it's big and broad and it's wonderful looking its leaves are not whither and how do you know whatever is doing its prospering Hollow it looks wonderful people look at and say that's a mighty good tree they sit down under it and they enjoy the shade it might enjoy the fruits thereof but what they don't know that what is empowering that tree that tree that they see above there's a route that goes just as deep down into the ground oh you want to see how great the tree is got a look at its roots oh go away town holiday into the ditch that's the part people don't see that's the pop where you're praying that's a pathway to in your 1/3 that's a pathway or twin you're that's a plan where you're applying the word that's a pathway or exercise on your page that's the part people don't see people love the fruits people love to have joy and have fellowship with you oh no but they might know if you're wrong when things are hard when things are trying when things are grim when things are grisly they might know is be around but I thank God that don't matter who is here who's not here as well as Court is with us as long as quarters with you how do you shall not be forsaken oh he will not forsake the ones have seek his face Oh [Applause] what a friend we have in Jesus hallelujah when the world walk away from us we still have a blessed hope when things turn away and things look down and out like you can make it and nobody knows the tears that you have in the nighttime when you're crying for your family when they're crying for your loved ones when you're going through and you are going through hallelujah but when you're going through with Jesus every day gets sweeter than the day before it's a point in the trial where he turns your mourning into gladness it's a point of turning for you and that point is usually at the end of your wits when you are willing now to raise up your hands up and say Lord you know better than I why this is happening I don't understand I don't I can't max it out I can't figure it out why all that was seeking me why all is lost why it seem like there's so much confusion but not I'm willing to accept your will let your will be done let mine be forsaken I'm willing to lay it down I'm willing to give up my rights share on my rights away in this world of sin Oh hallelujah hallelujah and you surrender all to him hallelujah I know my Lord will see me out he'll see a way through when you're willing to surrender all he wants you to lay down your intellect lay down your mind on the matter and take his mind for the matter begin to realize that he's got a greater purpose he's got a greater purpose for you being here there's a reason why you are here and you have to find it and God will show it to you and God will reveal it to you but first you have to lay down your own will when Jesus was at the Garden of Gethsemane and he said not my way Lord but PI will be done even Jesus had to come to a point of full surrender where was not his will anymore but it will let the Lord God's will be done hallelujah hallelujah and every one of us that's gotta come to a point of breaking we're gonna have to break you break your mind break your spirit cheer up your spirit up hallelujah you will recognize who he is in your life oh I let him be Lord let him be your Savior let him me olena Oh hallelujah then God began to work his way out of you because now he's got you he's got something he can use he's got something he could anoint hey man it's nothing Oh hallelujah so we ought to know who God is it's not right and who the devil is in order for you to see it this word had to be present tense to you isn't it hallelujah it's good to read the Bible it's good to open up the scripture and to read it it's inspired but unless it become inspired to you as an individual holla it won't do no good ha it's got to be inspired to you in your situation you've got to be able to apply it in real time hallelujah hallelujah though he slay me yet I trust him you've got to be able to trust him while in the midst of the storm in the midst of the temptation in the midst of the trial hallelujah it's no good just to hear what we got to recognize it and we've got to act upon it hallelujah is my man oh my I'm read something here so come my revelation it's not right hey man Jesus Christ reveal himself to us a man it's not right okay you read as he said have you never noticed how Satan hates 2 books of the Bible model another more than all the others to liberal theologians and tweedle scientists he's always attacking the book of Genesis and the book of Revelation is now in both these books we find satan's origin we find his awful wings and his destruction and why he attacks them talking about who God is who we are and who the devil is let's talk about the devil a little bit that that's why he attacks them he hates to be exposed and in those books he is exposed for exactly what he is halleluyah is not that old serpent called the devil Hollywood that deceiveth Collin is not the stars of heaven in there and he said now that it's exposing for who is jesus said about satan he has no part in me and I have no part in him the devil would like to prove that different but he cannot so he does all he can watch watch what he does no he does all he can to destroy confidence in the world because when you have confidence in the world there's nothing can penetrate that hallelujah holidays nothing can get past that hallelujah when you fortify yourself with the word holla is not Halloween let the weak say I'm strong you are fortified by the Word of God oh it makes you speak something it makes you live something it makes you believe something because a word of court heaven on earth will pass away but his word cannot pass away his word is an expression of God himself I went God give you his word he give you a portion of himself therefore all of the authority of God is in his word and when you take the Word of God and sent by His stripes I am healed and you Cham the devil in his mouth the devil cannot do anything about that Oh resist the devil and he will flee from you [Applause] [Laughter] [Music] you will have the victory you will have the victory every time you stay with this word every time you take this word forget about yourself forget about your intellect and just take the word for what it is hallelujah hallelujah you will have the victory every time Oh chlorine up on a devil knows it hallo hallo hallo might fight up with your situation but when you take the word for your situation watch the enemy go to running watch the enemy go to flee in seven ways from you why because you took the word hallelujah if Adam had stable to learn you don't never have fallen isn't that right but he put away to learn and he chose to go with his wife and that's what caused a form it's now right and all these things that happened back me when he stay with the word and what happens God shows us a continuation of the world God continues his work in us Oh we'll get a man my but when the church please believe Satan when the church you yab the believers this morning this believes Satan and believes the spirits revelation of the word then the gates of Hell cannot prevail against her so we're not just talking about reading the word now but he's talking about the spirits revelation of the word to you as an individual that's why revelation is so important that's why you've got to be in the spirit to catch revelation to catch what God is saying that's why we emphasize worship so much because worship creates a space for God to move worship invites the presence of the Lord for him to break the scriptures open to us so that you could see that your name is written in heaven and when you catch it when you understand who you are then the devil is in trouble then brother oh it's in trouble in your life he's in trouble in your situation he's in trouble in your circumstance because it's inspired to you and you know that no teller could take it away from you because they'll never give it to you in the first place it was God that called you it was his voice that spoke to your heart they'll let you know who you are and who you are Oh somebody shot a man [Applause] oh my oh my hallelujah hallelujah it's a power of the word don't worry about the signs and wonders it'll come but stay with that word once you see what that word God will reprimand the signs will follow them that believe hallelujah the signs and wonders our promise to follow him that believe I'm not call upon his name and not keep the prophecies of the saying of this book hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah so don't rejoice because the Devils are subject to you but rejoice rather because your name is written in heaven oh the case of hepcat prevail against them but I said now let me just put a word in here from my own ministry if you don't mind he may said you all know that the gift in my life is supernatural it is a gift whereby the Holy Spirit is able to discern a diseases and the thoughts of men's hearts and other hidden things that only God could know and then reveal to me he said I wish you could stand with me and see the faces of people when Satan knows he's going to be exposed he said now it isn't the people that I'm talking about is that it is that Satan God our world and their lives true sin indifference and disease but you should see their faces when Satan knows is going to be exposed he said it's the most peculiar changes now come over people's countenances this is something huh said Satan is a free he's a free this morning yeah he's very afraid he likes to hide in the dark like to hide in shady places kind of cockroach mentality praise God he knows that the Spirit of God is about to let the people know his works and that is why he hates these meetings so much oh that's why he hates it when you get weekend to raise the temperature in worship and in praise and in glory give Him glory to your God what are you doing you are exposing the enemy hallelujah for what he is he's a lie on a bluff no wonder the Bible says conduct yourself with joy amidst these trials it's not it's because when you have joy in the middle of your town in the middle of your circumstance you expose the devil for what he is he's a liar and he's a bluff he told joke I'll get him to curse you to your face don't go rather I'll get you to curse you to your face and he did all he could it was a mighty onslaught of Satan against job's life I'm gonna come down to the final and his wife say why don't you curse God and time but something in job say you speak like a foolish woman hallelujah God is still evil God is still my rock he's still my fortress I tore the skin worms destroy this body yet in my flesh I shall see him for myself Oh hallelujah praise God all that never tried to do he tore your flesh away so your spirit away took away your worldly possessions took away temporal things but the thing he cannot take it's your name that was written in heaven that's the thing though you go to trial though you go to Parham though you go to storm God cannot take away what he give you in the first place Oh hooey for knew he call we call he justified and who we justify he has already glorified Oh what can we then say to these things if caught before us this morning who can be against who can be against us how do you give it praise hallelujah [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] yeah many men huh oh my oh man so you're in a trial this morning expose the enemy praise God anyhow you're going through a test feel like you can't feel nothing you feel try like a rock praise God any harm what does it do it exposes the enemy I never lost my hope I never lost my joy I never lost my praise my praise is still here old friends will shake me my praise is still yeah he restores the joy of my salvation because I know in whom I I believe he has called me from the beginning he calls me his own he knows your name this morning Oh hallelujah and the Prophet said your name is not leave here it's not all robots it's not whatever it is a man and this natural life but not your name is a spiritual name hallelujah honey your name is a word of God for your age and for your time and season hallelujah hallelujah is not your name is a bride that's going to be revealing this last day your name is a mystery of what the book is while it is calling those names so and the mystery is being preached when seven thunders is being preached when the unknowing hallelujah is going out your name and shine connects with the name is being preached Oh something takes over the hands go up the heart rejoices tears of revelation to see what you see and to hear what you hear hallelujah oh my at that time Jesus rejoice in the spirit imagine he was a son of God yet he rejoiced to see the word being made manifest to see the word hallelujah come into view hallelujah to see Hallel to understand emails now I know just the understanding of it it makes your heart rejoice Jesus to know rejoice and say Lord you have hid these things from the wise and the prudent you've hid these things from the high and the mighty and the ones who think there's something but every V reveal himself to whoever he wants to reveal himself I saw thank God because if it was up to man then you have to have criteria you might have to have a certain amount of money in a bank you might have had to have a certain amount of accreditations or certificates or powers or influence but I saw thank God this morning that it's not up to manage choosing to choose you this morning but God loves you this morning enough Paul loved you so much that he sent His only Son to break the shackles off of each and every one of you Oh hallelujah praise God oh we have a right to shout we have a right to give God glory we have a right to give him all the praise that is true on to his name oh I'll worship him forever I'll dance forever I'll sing forever oh and through these gates with Thanksgiving and auntie's courts with praise we are his people and the Sheep of his pasture Oh wonderful so we explain exposing the enemy this morning I ran my sea for what he is all right Satan hates it he's afraid see now that no what is it what is this he said it's not mine reading it's not telepathy nor is it witchcraft he said it is a revelation by the Holy Ghost amen amen the same spirit he said the comforter will come I light a spirit of truth and guide you into all truth how does it come by the Holy Ghost amen amen that's the only way I can know it he said of course the carnal mind will call it anything but the Holy Ghost a man is not right but we see it for what it is a man oh how ideal of him this morning a man is more familiar to you he said now let me show you another reason why Satan hates the book of revelation of Jesus Christ in the church he knows that Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today and forever he changes not he knows that a whole lot more than do 90% of the theologians do so Satan knows I mean he was there in the beginning he worship with the Angels he was one of the most beautiful of them all is now Bible says pipes were built inside of him he was a musician a man and the Peter he was created a mesmerize a man he knows about worship he wanted worship he was deceived hallelujah but there was no grace for him and when he was deceived and he led the other angels a strain they too were deceived also isn't that right hallelujah is now right and he fell from the former stage that's why Jesus said I perceived Satan come down from heaven as lightning and he come down to the earth according to revelation 12 seeing one to the inhabiters of the earth for the enemy has come down to you and he knows he has but a short time he knows what's taking place he knows what's going on he knows it's night he was waiting till a wrong Genesis tree we hear about the serpent the most subtle beast of the field is not right who come to have a conversation with Eve Oh with the woman at that time because she wasn't called Eve until she ate until a man later on down a man in the judgments then she was called a woman and he had to come to have a conversation with a woman because the devil began to see things taking place and the devil was looking all the time but an opportunity where he could slip in to the program of God I don't know how long he was on yet but he came down on the earth he might have seen man form from the dust of the earth waiting to see where he could slip in he saw a woman come out a man he was waiting waiting waiting waiting for his opportunity waiting for his moment to grasp to take to steal to rob and to destroy Oh hallelujah is not it's not right hallelujah are waiting for an opportunity for a moment watch to twist the pure Word of God you guys remember the devil is not a creator he's a pervert he's a pervert of the original it's not everything that devil has is just a little substitute of what we think the real thing is he's just provided substitutes so a pervert so this allusion of this modern age that we live in and people also think it's so wonderful and they wanted to go on forever like this but little does man know that the glory that God has beyond the sky beyond the river is far more glorious than thing that ever could create down here [Applause] [Music] nothing that never could do that ever come close in its glory so what God has for you and I when you cross that River nothing that the devil could create could be more beautiful to be more attractive than what God has for us so they are waiting on us the comfortable faction to go to a glorious wonderful perfect City as a bride adorned for her husband oh you are promised to go in there will be the light oh right now they think they have remote technology and wireless and all these things Gordon make that already God have that long time as all stuff they were just trying to reproduce it Peter and Paul am animals in prison and different things there was praising God holidays in their eyes all of a sudden what took place push-button technology the key to open who asked me how it happened hallelujah quarter to anything hallelujah Jesus wanted to get these disciples and they were out there and a storm on the boat Jesus he's very walking on water he come walking on water when the disciples saw him coming they put it was a ghost they pulled over the apparition they got scared repeat the sword was Jesus technology hallelujah was floating on the water the storm was going so but that didn't bother Jesus he was walking on top of it when you know who you are you could walk on top of this storm you could turn this storm you could do whatever you want you [Applause] [Music] [Applause] are going to a city whose builder and maker is God he created it he established the foundations thereof and nothing in this world it's gonna hold me back I'm gonna worship I'm gonna praise like I have no more peeing brother praise God get next to yourself oh I'll do it my whole heart I will praise God in the Assembly of the upright and in the congregation hallelujah - see what we see and to hear what we hear huh jesus said prophets and kings longed to see what you see and to hear what you hear David when she was here Moses when she was here but God didn't let them see it because greater hallelujah is he that is in you this morning what God I'll show you but it's gonna raise them up from the grave they were not also not made perfect what God is about to reveal these last things no I have seen no ear has heard the glory that's about to reveal in this endtime prize hallelujah hallelujah our Moses looking down this binoculars oh it's a final age it's a final showdown the final conflict between God and Satan Oh over-the-pants no time brother branham is over the battle third time sing come on church you can make it come on judge believe the word it's not my word it's the words of Jesus Christ come on oh all you can live right live a holy life forsake or follow after Jesus pray with all you can pray without ceasing until every one of these virtues are living in you this morning brush with all that is within you to receive the baptism of the Holy Ghost it is worth it this morning it's worth the sacrifice it's we're coming in here on a Sunday morning lifting up our hands giving God the glory what are we here for to make a church that'll make a revival the bride hasn't had a revival yet but she will or the seven thunders will wake up again hallelujah mine mine my my mine let me skip the song here hey [Applause] hey let me skip down here America's here he said then I mentioned then it takes a Holy Spirit to give us revelation or we fail to get it bringing these two talks together you will see that it won't just take an ordinary study to make this book real inside but it's going to take the operation of the Holy Ghost that that that means watch what does it mean is that it means that this book can't be revealed to anyone but a special class of people let me say it again and I felt like it went over your head he said that means that this book cannot be revealed to just anyone but it must be revealed to a special class of people it will take one with prophetic insight it will require the ability to hear from God he taught in here let him hear what the Spirit is saying unto the churches God has a word for you this morning Oh a special class of people that's who you are this morning a special class they are soldiers and then they're special soldiers it have forces and then there are special forces you are special class of people because prophet said so because not everyone can understand this but blessed are your hears for what they hear blessed that I are eyes for what you see Oh your heart is blessed this morning because you understand what is written in this book [Applause] [Laughter] if luta was the common Sh and you had to explain to him what was taking place his mine will be blue because he didn't even know the fullness of this this image here this journey here at God took throughout the ages he would have to wander on Marvel and how he fits in there with patience it's not if Wesley come not here he didn't him understand the magnitude of what he was doing but he was proclaiming the Word of God in his age with all assurance with all revelation and what was it it was caught inspiring the word to each man in that day it's not they were all living out something they were all living out a mystery they were hid in God and each one broke out well it's not proclaiming something proclaiming the acceptable year proclaiming the Word of God proclaiming what Paul had said concerning the age and concerning their time and there was always a people to come out on every messenger in that age and just as sure as there was a prophet in this last day a mighty prophet who under which cord wrought miracles and signs and wonders he prophesied that the bride hasn't had a revival yet he suffered when the seven thunders uttered a group sudo coupe that can really take the Word of God and can hand it there it will slice it will cut till shut the heavens they'll open it till to whatever they want to praise hallelujah Oh [Music] [Applause] Oh hallelujah a special class of people one day the devil's gonna realize he was parking up the wrong tree one day the devil is gonna realize and he was messing with dynamite the whole time but she was hidden car this morning just as caught him this have some simplicity you were hidden in a black part of his mind he wanted to bring you forth but it wasn't time yet but when Luther came on and Wesley came on a lolly and the Pentecostals came on it begins they get closer and closer and closer to the fulfillment of the word so that this mighty pride could come forth we wasn't a comfort in part know we might know in part on prophesy in part but we was a comfort and perfection so in order for us to come forth in perfection he had to make a way for perfection hallelujah praise God hallelujah glory to God oh my are you catching me you are his wonderful glorious virtuous bra hallelujah isn't that right God loved you so much he wants you to come for the perfection so he had to make a way for that so he had to create a atmosphere how do you have to bring the word down hallelujah praise God the fullness of it and reveal it is profit not profit at a profit sir Honolulu is nice it was called for the pride in our last day Honolulu under her messenger and she would be the final voice to the finally holler she in order to be the final voice it had to come forth in the final age then you had to be here you couldn't come for the Luther's age oh that was a specification that wasn't a final age yet are you getting me okay all right back a little bit amen oh but a mystery said you see woky it will require a supernatural instruction it will require the ability to hear from God it's not right not just a student comparing verse to verse though that is good but a mystery requires the teaching of the spirit or it never becomes clear how we need to hear from God and lay ourselves open and become yielded to the spirit to hear and to know oh is that why we're here this morning to lay ourselves open to God that he could speak to us that he could show us his glory that he could show us all as reveal concerning us Oh hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah isn't that right that's why we get in a spirit and get Mel around their goal could speak at hollowed out so that God could speak to you only then the Spirit beholding his face shut in with God in a secret place Oh hallelujah hallelujah I want to be so hidden in the presence of God until he could speak to us until his spirit could flow over you wanna take away all your bitterness take away all their evil take away all their clamoring and commotion and strife pull that all out of you we were born in sin shipped in iniquity but because there's a greater purpose in your heart God had to pull all that dross back off of you so he had to take you through a process so that you could be cut into the diamond you have to take it to a process so that he could beat you into pure gold you have to take you to a process revelation 1 says I was in the spirit on the Lord's Day and heard behind me a great voice as of a trumpet isn't that right talking with me Amen John was in the spirit ohana so - we've got get in the spirit what spirit the spirit of the coming of the Lord Oh hallelujah we are we are watching waiting for his coming and when we wait for his coming watching and watching we're making ourselves ready the Bible says his wife had made herself ready Hollan is not who is she the Lambs wife she is a pride of Jesus Christ she knows who she is she knows her spirits that's supposed to come to her in this last day hallelujah she's watching for it she's watching for his coming she knows he's out there somewhere she can feel it she knows the same part I poured out in the day of Pentecost is the same Jesus that's promised to come back again and anoint a bride in a last time it's the same power that will take her up out of the earth and into glory Oh hallelujah praise car hallelujah hallelujah oh man praise God so we identify the devil already amen is that a man he is that serpent the devil Lucifer that was cast out of heaven isn't that right revelation 13:8 all that dwell upon the earth shall worship Him whose names are not written in the book of life of the lamb slain from the foundation of the world it's not all shower ship that's a prophecy all of them to hide the mighty the one who think there's something priest caught as long as their name is not in this book praise God hallelujah all shall worship but it also says except those whose names except a man also worship him except those whose names are written amen those whose names are not written the book of life for same from the foundation world a man is now reign hallelujah so all shall worship Him except those names that are written in the blood section of the book isn't that right that's where God hid you inside of there hallelujah praise God amen hallelujah is now now watch amen hallelujah so we said the devil is a pervert isn't that right he's a polluted original truth he knows he original he knows a message but he comes down and he perverts it and he twists it why because he knows that when he does that it becomes cold formal and powerless isn't it and then I become the word of comes up non effect it's not hallelujah no because it's out of position it's out of place it's like a puzzle piece no all right without revelation if the bird is supposed to be in a tree the bird ends up in the grass and the call ends up in a tree hallelujah no revelation you haven't put it together right Amen well with divine revelation in our lives we know what we are and what we are supposed to produce is now hallelujah hallelujah the Prophet said if you don't have revelation he said if you don't know what a bathtub is he said somebody could give you a watermelon and tell you that is this is and you believe it because you don't know for yourself but when it's revealed to you what it is no one can deceive you no one can mess you up isn't that right hallelujah hallelujah like what but over is talking about with the original and then you have the substitute substitute it's not a man it's like somebody goes down to a car parts place and they tell him this is the part for this said I come looking for your part and make people take advantage of the ignorance a man they don't know the price they don't know what they're looking for praise God so they come down and say well this is a thousand is fifteen hundred dollars praise God they mark the price of a man and see the like stop mark the price up tell me you got to do this you got to do that then go to love you but where was that when I lay the foundation on your when the morning stars sang together you've got to know that the price was already paid never trying to put a mark up on your life never trying to shake ties trying to bargain with you praise God you've got to know that you were already bought and paid for by the blood of Jesus Christ Oh hallelujah praise God he can't put a mark upon you come on now hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah the piece will deceive all except those names who are written in the Lamb's Book of Life they know who their father is they know who their husband is they are the bride of Jesus Christ they will support and power Oh hallelujah they will say unto this mountain be removed and be thou cast into the sea we're a perfect fit and then watch it happen because God will be inside of them oh they will have his potentials Oh somebody same [Applause] Amen oh my okay it meant pre-scored wonderful the 11:00 this morning a man so he knows that see but he twists it so they could come cool and powerless because then his deception it's not right the same thing he told the eve you shall not surely it's not right he took the word that she received and he twisted it with his own interpretation hallelujah I lost the whole thing right there praise God and she received that amen and she accepted that a lie and then it festered isn't that right and that's how we end up with a fall of man today so how do we get back to the original we've got to take the whole world how do we get back to the Garden of Eden again we've got to take the whole world a man not the devil's interpretation of it but what the Prophet said it would be and what Jesus said it would be we take the whole world Poland the whole truth and nothing but the truth oh and the whole truth is that you are gonna be filled with the Holy Ghost the whole truth is that you are gonna be sealed that you're gonna be attractive that you're gonna be victorious that no weapon formed against you shall prosper that is the whole truth and we're here to preach the truth we had to preach every promise that he revealed for the bride in the last day because it is by these promises that we become partakers of his divine nature having escaped the corruption that is in the world through lust Lori took God hallelujah that's how we escaped by applying these promises to us and by beholding him as in a glass the glory of the Lord we are changed into that same image from glory to glory even as by the Spirit of the Lord not by your mind not by the will of man not by the will of man imagine arise but by the will of God that is how we were born that is how we come we didn't call I didn't call you the pastor didn't call you no man called you this morning it was caught that called you her it was call that has has a position of place for you in his kingdom it is called I will place the endtime Church and some apostles and some prophets some teachers some evangelists it is God that will to it in this last scene and we're looking for him to do it because when he does it he does it right man when he does a job it's a perfect job God is not halfway he's a complete car and when he does the job he does a complete job when he calls a man he calls him completely Hollow he fits him for the job I wanna be ready I wanna be fully made a servant of God not halfway not ninety nine and nine-tenths but completely surrender whoa do you want that this morning Amy are you willing to be surrender to be used of God hallelujah hallelujah Court could only use you as much as you're willing to give no Samsung gave his strength to go we give his heart to a woman isn't that right Holly it's not right as much as you're willing to surrender to him is what he will use isn't that right if you're only willing to surrender 25% that's all he could use well if he if you're only willing to throw in a fifty or sixty five maybe that's all he could use but this morning goes looking for people who want to be fully surrendered to God Oh hallelujah I want to be fully committed to be fully used by him hallelujah hallelujah is not you want to be able to tap you on the shoulder you should be so close to God we're going to speak to you and you could speak back and he could speak back and you can have true conversation a true communion Oh Oh hallelujah oh my it's not right hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah amen amen Oh glory they love him this morning hallelujah God wants to speak to us God wants us to be in such a condition of surrender that he could use us for his own and for his glory hallelujah this week I was thing about that Psalm Psalm 23 the Lord is my shepherd I shall not want he is my shepherd he is my leader is what David was saying he is the Lord of my life wherever he lead me I will follow him wherever he lead me wherever he choose to take me they as well will go he will lead me beside the green pastures he will lead me beside the still waters he restoreth my soul oh how did he lead me in the paths of righteousness for his name's sake and he ate oh I walk through the valley of the shadow of death I will fear no evil because my name is written in heaven because my name was written down there I could go through the valley of the shadow of death because I don't just have any shepherd but the Lord is my shepherd he is the Good Shepherd and jesus said my sheep hear my voice a strangers voice they will not follow we have not followed the voice of a man but we have followed the voice of God in these last days we have not heard from man but we've been hear from our theophany it's been calling us higher calling us to Al and me on the river Oh somebody say man somebody say hallelujah or glory to God a man Oh hallelujah hallelujah someone said blessed as a man had walketh not in the counsel of the ungodly i standed in the way of the sinner who sitteth in the seat of the scornful but his delight is in the law of the Lord and in the law that he meditate day and night and he shall be like a tree planted by the rivers of water Oh hallelujah honor you see some similarities in Psalms 23 where he leadeth me beside the still waters he he restoreth my soul hallelujah he make it for me and up table in the presence of mine enemies he anointed my head with oil my cup runneth over he satisfies thy mouth with good things and response I Ute and renews my youth Lady Eagle I was thinking about it and a part that choked out for me the most in Psalm 23 it's a part when he said I shall not want I shall not want imagine coming into such a condition with God until there's no more want you know the world today is driven by so many wants by so many desires desires for things it's described at a need I need is something you need to have it's something you can do it out but I want is something you could you could go on living without having it yet somehow in all human nature's we make all wants more important than our needs and God knows what we need this morning Oh hallelujah hallelujah we might want this and we might want that and we might want temporal things and we might want a certain sense of self security but what God really wants to get over to us is what we really need for the journey Oh hallelujah hallelujah all God wants our people today that are not so driven by their wants by the selfish desires by the selfish opinions but a people are so sold out to God aha that is so sold out to Jesus and all you want is him and all you need is his spirit oh how do you no longer want to take to the world you no longer watch on this house you no longer want your leadership but you are willing to surrender yourself wholly unfitted a mercy of God whereby he could lead you where he could show you where he could instruct you [Applause] [Laughter] halleluyah halleluyah halleluyah you want it you could do it out it but you wanted so badly and way to see even into thinking that these temporal things could fill up the first the God put in your soul for the Holy Ghost the devil deceive some of us into thinking that these temporal things will satisfy us and keep us but we recognize sooner rather than later imaginary sooner or later we realize that these things lose their novelty these things lose their direct value over time Hallel you build your hope this morning on things eternal hallelujah hallelujah that is Conner holily that is enmity that is of the flesh that is only temporal those things shall vanish away but build your hopes
