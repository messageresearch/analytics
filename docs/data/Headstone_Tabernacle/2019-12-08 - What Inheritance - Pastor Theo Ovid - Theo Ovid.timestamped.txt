[45:44] of the world that we should be holy I
[45:47] would out blame before him in love
[45:49] having predestinated us unto the
[45:51] adoption of children by Jesus Christ
[45:54] himself according to the good pleasure
[45:55] of his will to the praise of the glory
[45:58] of His grace wherein he had made us

[46:13] prudence having made known unto us the
[46:15] mystery of his will according to good
[46:18] pleasure of it which he had purposed in
[46:20] himself that in the dispensation of the
[46:23] fullness of times he might gather

[57:33] mornin reserve glory my god a member of
[57:43] Stephen hallelujah alright trying to get
[57:46] started here so when I'm sin by heeding
[57:50] his wife's reasoning instead of holding
[57:52] to God's Word his wife reasoned which
[57:56] Seaton and then produced a product to
[57:58] Adam Adam turn loose the word so loud he
[58:02] lost also his inheritance when he lost
[58:08] his fellowship and right to life I done
[58:12] lost what he lost his inheritance he
[58:17] lost his eternal life he lost his
[58:19] fellowship so if God after restore
[58:24] Suns back to Eden the fellowship after
[58:28] be restored
[58:29] [Music]
[58:31] eternal life has been restored and
[58:35] inheritance after restore all that Adam

[58:46] bigger one and all will be restored
[58:51] right back
[58:52] I am NOT a Pentecostal another Baptist
[58:57] or Methodist that too short and too
[58:59] small for me to be identified with that
[59:02] what an identified width is the sons of
[59:06] God the manifest of the sons of God what
[59:10] Adam was before the fall
[59:14] [Applause]
[59:18] my identity is with Adam before the fall
[59:24] because God has purpose to respond back
[59:28] zapman not another man the same man he
[59:37] bring him back whatever image was has to
[59:41] come back
[59:41] whatever I've liked this was have to
[59:44] come back and that man have the power
[59:48] you'll be seated
[59:50] so when he lost his life he lost his
[59:54] inheritance in life and then bharanam
[59:57] flashed us out here because he was
[1:00:01] completely supreme control of the earth
[1:00:05] he was a god of the earth small G God is
[1:00:10] a God of the universe as the big G but

[1:00:17] he could speak he could name he could
[1:00:22] say he can stop Nietzsche he could do
[1:00:26] anything that he wanted to but when he

[1:13:52] Maureen Oh God hallelujah Oh help me
[1:13:57] Jesus before Calvary blood of bulls and
[1:14:02] goats could only cover sins so they
[1:14:04] elected that died could only be held in
[1:14:07] a place called Paradise was a holding me
[1:14:10] because the way for the sixth dimension
[1:14:12] was not yet made but when Jesus died he
[1:14:15] went down to Paradise I don't look that
[1:14:19] dog and chance for the Saints that was
[1:14:22] under the blood of bulls and goats
[1:14:24] because his blood was the perfect blood
[1:14:26] the price canceled everything oh honey

[1:14:41] glory and those those believers written
[1:14:45] in you and I we cannot just come to
[1:14:47] perfection so we have to go beyond the
[1:14:50] church ages that'll be on luta Yun
[1:14:53] Presley be under great mighty
[1:14:55] Pentecostal revival we have to go way
[1:14:58] beyond that we also go to the back side
[1:15:00] of the book where the devil - take a
[1:15:02] look and we have to draw from India or
[1:15:05] glory no God and about my genocide Ashok
[1:15:09] then the biker identify the voice the
[1:15:12] voice magnet voice of the Archangel
[1:15:15] going to being a bride and one day paler
[1:15:18] than the grave to hear the voice of the
[1:15:20] Son of God that voice of Jesus will be
[1:15:23] in the bride and the dead in Christ
[1:15:25] shall rise and we who are alive and
[1:15:28] remain shall be caught up
[1:15:33] I don't want to miss this Oh glory to
[1:15:36] God be Hewell eyes on remaining
[1:15:40] Oh glory record business party is the
[1:15:45] upshot deed that God required life for
[1:15:48] death and the gardener even then Jesus
[1:15:50] the righteous one died and took besides
[1:15:53] the lead and was able to break the seals
[1:15:57] reveal what was in them and give the
[1:16:01] inheritance that belong to him to his
[1:16:06] people
[1:16:07] eternal life that he inherited by doing
[1:16:11] that he passed his own life back altar
[1:16:14] Calvary and divided it among us by the
[1:16:19] Holy Ghost
[1:16:20] so at Calvary people said Jesus died for
[1:16:24] me and he died for my sins but it's more
[1:16:25] than that
[1:16:26] he died that the book the book was in is
[1:16:29] most important thing because the book
[1:16:31] held the key to produce more sons of God
[1:16:35] without that book you couldn't get back
[1:16:38] a reproduction of the original so you
[1:16:41] have to get the book we got the book

[1:41:00] Eber Alam
[1:41:02] why didn't he see the lamb before the
[1:41:05] lamb had been seated on the Father's
[1:41:08] throne inside the guards and John could
[1:41:12] not see deer because if for God was God
[1:41:15] in the Tron so the lamb was sick let me
[1:41:17] show you no but you are looking drunk
[1:41:20] Tasi because the lamb was behind the
[1:41:24] guns John could not see into there he
[1:41:28] only seen those four headed for beasts
[1:41:30] and India news for cherubim standing
[1:41:32] guard in the holy place but the show it
[1:41:35] was not a natural beast the lamb because
[1:41:37] it took the book out of the right hand
[1:41:39] he mustered up on the throne notice it
[1:41:41] was a lamb Redeemer I like that word a
[1:41:45] lamb Redeemer God can never change the
[1:41:49] foolish Redeemer was a lamb in the ghana
[1:41:51] eden it was a lamb that god offered and
[1:41:54] here is again remote what did when they
[1:41:57] were found naked he kill a lamb that was
[1:42:00] represented redemption watch and here
[1:42:03] again in Revelation is again a lamb to
[1:42:06] redeem what the fallen condition
[1:42:08] befallen inheritance of her followers of
[1:42:11] people a lamb come to redeem like always
[1:42:13] was beginning to redeem us to redeem
[1:42:15] what watch what does he bring back to us
[1:42:18] Islam everything we had at the beginning
[1:42:22] I want you to see that this morning is
[1:42:25] not just a church life it's not just
[1:42:28] coming to church you know hi I'm a safe
[1:42:30] know I'm a Christian girl no no no no he
[1:42:33] redeemed everything that was lost what
[1:42:38] did we have at the beginning question
[1:42:41] eternal life
[1:42:44] we was heirs of the world
[1:42:46] we had life we never had to die we never
[1:42:50] had to be sick we never had to get all
[1:42:52] we never had any worries
[1:42:54] there was no funerals no graves no evil
[1:42:56] no death no gray here no spook shoulders
[1:42:59] no mourning no crime we have life
[1:43:01] eternal life and we had jurisdiction
[1:43:04] over all the it we were a god of the
[1:43:10] earth we could walk about the tree and
[1:43:13] if we didn't like the tree standing
[1:43:14] there we can say we plucked up here and
[1:43:16] set over here it will do it the wind was
[1:43:18] blowing we didn't warn the winds a blow
[1:43:20] peace be still and it did it and what
[1:43:22] did he come to do redeem all that back
[1:43:26] to us again and burn and say oh my get
[1:43:32] all that back again and now nature
[1:43:35] itself is groaning waiting for what the
[1:43:38] manifestation of the sons of God for the
[1:43:40] sons of God to be manifested because
[1:43:43] when man fell because nature was under
[1:43:46] man Beach FL also so nature fell under
[1:43:49] the curse because man is ruler itself
[1:43:52] and what was under it fell also so
[1:43:56] nature is groaning for man to get back
[1:43:58] in position to bring it right up
[1:44:01] Oh glory to God hallelujah no yeah we
[1:44:06] have the earnest of our salvation now
[1:44:08] and can take our brother that's dying
[1:44:11] with cancer and stand with that little
[1:44:13] breath of redemption and pray the prayer
[1:44:17] of feet over him that will turn a shadow
[1:44:19] of a man back to healthy again what will
[1:44:23] we do when our full possession comes
[1:44:27] he said right now with a little breath
[1:44:30] of redemption
[1:44:31] we could pray the prayer of faith and
[1:44:33] see people healed what will happen when
[1:44:37] the full possession comes because nature
[1:44:41] was cursed with his master but when its
[1:44:43] master was Christi is the nature fell
[1:44:46] with the master but when this
[1:44:47] kinsman-redeemer come and redeem back
[1:44:49] the man that the master over nature then
[1:44:52] all nature is written for man master Oh
[1:44:55] glory to God hallelujah so when the Lamb
[1:44:59] took the book and John said we shall
[1:45:00] reign on the earth john saw that he was
[1:45:04] going to return back to the inheritance
[1:45:06] which was the earth we not supposed to
[1:45:09] be in just six dimensions floatin in
[1:45:11] heaven heaven is a hole in place until
[1:45:13] we come to the fullness of redemption
[1:45:15] that we could get back on the earth is
[1:45:18] where we belong or glory to God you
[1:45:21] believe that hallelujah part of our
[1:45:25] inheritance is sin John 14:12 the same
[1:45:28] works I do shall you do also is not
[1:45:30] right send mark 16 these signs shall
[1:45:33] follow them that believe st. mark 11:23
[1:45:36] if you shall say to the mountain be
[1:45:38] moving on talk in your heart this is
[1:45:40] what we're here for
[1:45:41] not that under Church and go back home
[1:45:42] but to manifest or redemptive rites
[1:45:51] Oh glory hallelujah glory so notice when
[1:46:02] Jesus took the book and he brought it
[1:46:04] down in ruins at 10-7 angel reveal every
[1:46:08] mystery and then what the voice said go
[1:46:11] and take the book and eat it and
[1:46:13] prophesy prophesy were gonna happen to
[1:46:16] you why you could see yourself not gonna
[1:46:19] make it any feet right why are you
[1:46:20] talking at me I'm not gonna be here you
[1:46:22] a question I'm here or delivered no you
[1:46:24] have to prophesy the word you get the
[1:46:27] prophesied the word isn't that right
[1:46:29] Oh glory to God hallelujah glory to God
[1:46:33] Oh inheritance is that we can arena in
[1:46:35] the earth
[1:46:35] I'm escaping quickly you know praise God
[1:46:39] and he said now in whom Scripture after
[1:46:42] you believe after hear the word of truth
[1:46:44] the gospel of your salvation that you
[1:46:47] were sealed with the Holy Spirit of
[1:46:50] promise which is the earnest of our
[1:46:55] inheritance until the redemption of the
[1:46:58] purchased possession so this Holy Ghost
[1:47:02] is a down payment
[1:47:10] you get that sometime you buy the house
[1:47:13] the absolute 10% so the course called
[1:47:16] house cost a million dollars the
[1:47:18] $100,000 10% and any bank will lend us
[1:47:21] any money
[1:47:22] so the earnest holy ghost is a down
[1:47:24] payment hallelujah
[1:47:26] a down payment on your inheritance that
[1:47:29] is reserved so there is no justification
[1:47:35] for anybody to leave you sad because
[1:47:40] what is yours is already reserved nobody
[1:47:43] can take it and it tied to your name
[1:47:46] because nobody can have your name you
[1:47:49] are you I stopped the book or my never
[1:47:54] leave it is the mission of what the book
[1:47:56] is as the world is being preached you
[1:47:58] are seen an image that's nice that's
[1:48:01] nice if you have a little message go and
[1:48:04] listen back to Wednesday message making
[1:48:05] claims you have to claim your children
[1:48:08] you have to clean the Holy Ghost just a
[1:48:10] shame a revival you have to clean your
[1:48:12] heel and you have to clean it but it
[1:48:18] takes a to make claims
[1:48:20] [Music]
[1:48:26] whole word Redemption but random until
[1:48:30] the day that the book of redemption has
[1:48:32] been revealed and the Redeemer comes to
[1:48:35] claim his possession nothing can do it
[1:48:37] don't grieve it in other words he took
[1:48:38] the scripture scream not the Holy Spirit
[1:48:41] of God whereby you are sealed until the
[1:48:45] day of redemption hallelujah he's a hole
[1:48:49] at word redemption until the day that
[1:48:51] the book of edom shall be revealed and
[1:48:53] the Redeemer comes the claim is
[1:48:54] possession nothing can do it don't
[1:48:56] grieve it don't do the thing that

[1:49:22] notice this book is sealed and you are
[1:49:24] sealed with the book until the day of
[1:49:26] redemption so the book I walk without

[2:05:47] Oh glory to God amen so brother branham
[2:05:51] said Christ he said Joshua Moses brought
[2:05:54] him up to the land but did not give them
[2:05:56] the inheritance he led him up to the
[2:05:58] land but Joshua divided the land to the
[2:06:01] people and Christ brought the church up
[2:06:03] to the place the way their possession
[2:06:04] was made to them and given them just
[2:06:06] Jordan the cross but the Holy Spirit is
[2:06:09] the one who said suggest in order that
[2:06:11] Joshua of the day puts the church in
[2:06:14] order given each one gives some places
[2:06:16] on position and he's the voice of God
[2:06:19] speaking to the inner man that Christ
[2:06:21] I've saved the Holy Spirit no we are
[2:06:23] getting over to the book of Ephesians
[2:06:25] and the same way he positionally placed
[2:06:27] the church where they belong
[2:06:28] just show up place them in a natural
[2:06:30] land and the Holy Spirit is placed in
[2:06:32] the church positionally in the land the
[2:06:35] position that they belong to so the
[2:06:37] whole book of Joshua wishes a type of
[2:06:38] Ephesians just was just replace them
[2:06:41] naturally in the land the Holy Spirit
[2:06:43] pays some people into the land the land
[2:06:45] of promise isn't that right now work the
[2:06:47] Holy Ghost was the one who came down in
[2:06:50] the upper room on the day of Pentecost
[2:06:51] and set the church in order
[2:06:53] Jesus himself couldn't do it he said I
[2:06:56] must go if I don't bought a comforter
[2:06:58] will not come so when Jesus left the
[2:07:00] Holy Ghost came down to get each one of
[2:07:02] them and they were born into the kingdom
[2:07:04] of God hallelujah
[2:07:06] but abarim said we are promised a corner
[2:07:09] ocean ten Malakai for look something
[2:07:11] thirty that there will come a Ephesians
[2:07:13] at this that there must come and
[2:07:15] Ephesians so even though the Bible said
[2:07:17] loud this year and so on after that
[2:07:19] God's promise and Ephesians which is a
[2:07:22] hidden mystery right in front the
[2:07:24] devil's face he don't you know that he
[2:07:26] don't understand when he shall turn the
[2:07:28] heart of the chair and back to the face
[2:07:29] of the father's Mimi came back and pick
[2:07:31] up Ephesians say there's going to be
[2:07:33] another Ephesians church another
[2:07:35] apostolic church and that church was
[2:07:38] like Joshua Oh glory to God hallelujah
[2:07:41] cuz we give the Lord a shout hallelujah
[2:07:44] and he said there must come a Ephesians
[2:07:47] that these Sevenfold mysteries of the
[2:07:49] Word of God must be unfolded understand
[2:07:52] the loudest an age that this takes place
[2:07:54] I
[2:07:55] we are here I believe we are right in
[2:07:57] the shadows of the coming of the Son of
[2:07:59] God and as Joshua just before the
[2:08:02] Ephesians raised up so there's John the
[2:08:04] Baptist raised up just before the next
[2:08:06] Ephesians and we are promised and not
[2:08:09] Ephesians it is predicted here in the
[2:08:11] Bible a lot of ministers don't notice
[2:08:13] but this is the promise not Corinthians
[2:08:16] not Hebrew babies not the Corinthian
[2:08:19] church not Galatians Oh hallelujah but a
[2:08:22] real Ephesian Church where you
[2:08:24] understand that you are predestinated
[2:08:26] unto adoption God predetermined that
[2:08:30] you're gonna make it the devil can't
[2:08:33] stop you you are gonna make it because

[2:09:07] say to these things if God be for us who
[2:09:09] can be against us or God will fight
[2:09:12] yourself be patience with your own self
[2:09:15] and be patient with God he has service
[2:09:18] with you yet did ever want to tell you

[2:09:43] [Applause]
[2:09:50] so will we not present topics we are
[2:09:54] preaching a vision that's the difference
[2:09:57] a lot of ministers depression topics
[2:10:00] publisher discussing topics and talk
[2:10:02] about we're not talking topic we're
[2:10:04] talking about a vision and when you get
[2:10:07] a vision right any topic of fittin
[2:10:10] because you have the entire vision you
[2:10:13] have to have a vision if they don't have
[2:10:17] a vision of the house they were sick son
[2:10:18] you go see cement you will see gravel
[2:10:20] you will see all kind of thing all you
[2:10:22] see this material and they discuss in
[2:10:24] your preaching the name the material you
[2:10:25] see the steel and he pushes a making
[2:10:27] steel then they go to the gravel
[2:10:29] there's good eating and they got rocks
[2:10:30] and break it up and then it'll gravel
[2:10:32] here and next master could be on on
[2:10:34] cement or the mix cement and so on that
[2:10:38] is just information and immaterial but
[2:10:41] when you see the hose you understand how
[2:10:44] to mix in semen turn this steel to put
[2:10:48] it in box in the pod is to concrete it's
[2:10:52] not cement I discussing you know is
[2:10:53] concrete cement sand and gravel will
[2:10:56] make something called concrete so you

[2:11:02] together to stop a seventh under revival
[2:11:05] so you get butter with other people
[2:11:07] talking this and talking that you not
[2:11:09] comfortable materials you have a vision
[2:11:11] of the hopes that court must build when
[2:11:14] Solomon had that vision he sent for
[2:11:17] materials all over the world and there
[2:11:20] was no need ever saw Hanna it was so
[2:11:22] clear it was so clean that when Solomon
[2:11:26] first billet or glory of God it was so

[2:11:33] strange-looking stone it was a stone
[2:11:36] that the builders didn't recognize but
[2:11:39] that was the key stone that was the
[2:11:42] capstone
[2:11:43] that was the cornerstone or glory look

[2:16:23] seven six he said it is all to be
[2:16:26] gathered up into the revelation of the
[2:16:28] Son of Man
[2:16:32] so brother Branham seventh messenger
[2:16:34] open six because Christ is his seventh
[2:16:37] seal and has gotten up no Son of Man in
[2:16:41] him then son of man in him said come to
[2:16:46] the unveiling of the mighty god that was
[2:16:49] not brother Branham that was Jesus
[2:16:51] Christ beginning to unveil himself and
[2:16:54] subtle knew some mysteries in this
[2:16:55] message that is only for the bride or

[2:17:57] representing the faith the faith didn't
[2:17:59] come into him yet he said I represent
[2:18:02] the faith by the way of a divine gift
[2:18:04] but one day that angel happened to him

[2:32:47] Oh hallelujah it's not something to say
[2:32:50] I have it you don't have it no I see it
[2:32:53] therefore I could die I could surrender
[2:32:57] to God I think I want to I want to read
[2:33:00] this year and I close to this is paradox
[2:33:03] but I'm talking the translation mind
[2:33:06] spoke in tongues and a man interpreted
[2:33:08] because there was chosen the hard way
[2:33:15] because that was chosen a narrow path
[2:33:18] the hard way that's a choice there's
[2:33:23] always the easy way you could be a free
[2:33:25] thinker you do your own thing you hide
[2:33:27] your duck you have known yourself in
[2:33:30] ministry and you're not seeking advice
[2:33:33] or counsel young
[2:33:39] listen this because that was chosen a
[2:33:42] narrow path the hard way that was made
[2:33:44] walk of your own chosen in other words I
[2:33:46] didn't have to do it
[2:33:47] I can side in and go with them if I want
[2:33:50] to but I see I wanted to steam with the
[2:33:52] wood is God speaking that was picked the
[2:33:54] Karaka precise decision it is my way if
[2:33:57] you notice he said because of this
[2:33:59] momentous decision a huge portion of
[2:34:02] heaven awaits thee now that's what I
[2:34:05] wondered when I died would it be then
[2:34:07] have the thing F is the portion of the
[2:34:09] different portions to us up there heaven
[2:34:12] is the kingdom of heaven that's within
[2:34:13] us that one all waits for no watch what
[2:34:16] a glorious decision that was made this
[2:34:19] in itself is that wish given may come to
[2:34:22] pass the tremendous victory in the love
[2:34:25] divine hallelujah
[2:34:28] oh my can I continue a little bit but
[2:34:34] upon say continue here a signal no they
[2:34:39] go what you make it do so I just are the
[2:34:41] continuous oh thank you
[2:34:42] question there's a man a debt go to
[2:34:45] heaven or to hell immediately or do they
[2:34:48] wait the judgment you see that's a good
[2:34:50] question now God got to keep his word he
[2:34:52] can't do nothing else but keep his word
[2:34:55] he said you're born in sin shape in
[2:34:57] equity commonly well speaking lines so
[2:35:00] you were born you are sinner by nature
[2:35:02] so there's nothing in the world you can
[2:35:04] do about that there's nothing I could do
[2:35:06] to save myself or you can do to save
[2:35:07] yourself
[2:35:08] it's what Christ did for us okay now
[2:35:11] this sinner has got to stand judgment
[2:35:13] and there won't be but this judgment is
[2:35:15] like a sickle listen carefully it's like
[2:35:18] a circle a rainbow around the world of
[2:35:21] the blood of Christ so he said right now
[2:35:24] there's a circle around the world it's a
[2:35:27] blood of Christ okay now if God could
[2:35:33] look down on the earth in this condition
[2:35:36] tonight any other way down through the
[2:35:39] blood of Earth he would destroy it in a
[2:35:42] second
[2:35:47] so the blood of Jesus is cyclical it God
[2:35:52] has seen the earth through the blood of
[2:35:53] Jesus that is where the judgments is
[2:35:58] coming if a man under here no matter if
[2:36:01] the man is a drunkard a gambler a
[2:36:03] horrible unbeliever the mercies of God
[2:36:07] still have tones for him right now
[2:36:10] that's how you could testify to anybody
[2:36:13] you could share the world with anybody
[2:36:14] come eat whatever it is because the
[2:36:16] Moose's of God now still have tones for
[2:36:19] them why the pump of the blood is around
[2:36:23] the earth could I continue and a woman
[2:36:26] she might be a prostitute
[2:36:28] whatever the blood of Jesus still atones
[2:36:31] for her SoDo right nobody off you don't
[2:36:37] have that authority let's continue but
[2:36:41] the minute that her soul leaves this
[2:36:45] body and she goes beyond that she is
[2:36:50] passed from mercy in the judgment so as
[2:36:54] long as their lives of a chance because
[2:36:56] the bond bumper is around here once the
[2:36:58] dinosaur pass that they exposed this
[2:37:02] judgment do you get that so you can say
[2:37:06] this one can make it down one can make
[2:37:07] it no
[2:37:09] the police here that's why you should
[2:37:13] forgive because the blood is still there
[2:37:19] you can see my blood cast on this one
[2:37:21] I'm a black cat take this one you can
[2:37:22] talk that talk so watch once her soul
[2:37:29] leaves the body
[2:37:30] she passed an over mercy in the judgment
[2:37:32] go already judge her that's a flick
[2:37:33] she's done she's judged you judge
[2:37:36] yourself by the way you treat God's
[2:37:40] procreation there for your sins you
[2:37:43] judge yourself you don't judge him just
[2:37:46] enough to forgive you if you think if
[2:37:48] you think he'll forgive you confess your
[2:37:50] force and he will forgive you but when
[2:37:53] we die we die now we go directly into
[2:37:57] the presence of Almighty God in a
[2:37:59] celestial body if I would meet brother
[2:38:02] Neville up there if we both die now in
[2:38:04] that hour from now and on all from now I
[2:38:06] will meet him and say greetings by the
[2:38:08] nettle and talk to him I couldn't shake
[2:38:11] his hand he's in a celestial body I
[2:38:13] could talk to him he looked just like he
[2:38:16] does know I look like I do but we could
[2:38:19] talk to one another but we couldn't
[2:38:21] touch one another because we haven't got
[2:38:23] any of the five senses of ctess feel
[2:38:27] smell and hear but we would be immortal
[2:38:30] and we could see one another we would
[2:38:33] live in the bless of realms over the
[2:38:35] altar of God
[2:38:36] now when Jesus which is in us now in the
[2:38:39] form of the Holy Ghost when his
[2:38:42] celestial body the Holy Spirit returns
[2:38:44] with the glorified body we will be
[2:38:47] glorified with him in his likeness and
[2:38:49] then I will shake his hand and say here
[2:38:52] it is but a Nevel jesus told His
[2:38:55] disciples taken the communion I will eat
[2:38:57] no more of the fruit of the vine until I
[2:38:59] eat it and drink it with you a new in my
[2:39:01] father's Kingdom
[2:39:02] there it is so a justified person
[2:39:06] standing in the presence of God goes
[2:39:10] into his presence as an immortal being
[2:39:14] and lives in the realm of the blessed
[2:39:16] the blessing Ram of peace until the day
[2:39:19] returns now when the people didn't go
[2:39:22] into the presence of God when they died
[2:39:24] there was once a time that didn't go in
[2:39:26] presence of God that was the Old
[2:39:27] Testament they went into a place called
[2:39:30] paradise where their souls just waited
[2:39:33] in paradise but paradise was a place
[2:39:36] where God kept the souls in dreamland
[2:39:39] until the blood of Jesus was shed for
[2:39:43] the blood of bulls and goats could not
[2:39:44] take away sin it only covered sin but
[2:39:47] when he died at Calvary on his return he
[2:39:50] brought out the grave those dead scenes
[2:39:53] that had died under the atonement of
[2:39:55] blood on bulls and goats and they
[2:39:57] entered into the city oh my as I often
[2:40:03] said you cannot be here a spiritual
[2:40:09] being sinner or Saint without having an
[2:40:14] influence from the underworld or from
[2:40:19] the above world so every day you're
[2:40:22] walking through life underworld
[2:40:24] influence coming up above world
[2:40:27] influence coming down here we go this is
[2:40:31] important if you are influenced from
[2:40:34] here above you are from above your
[2:40:39] celestial body is written up there but
[2:40:42] if you are wicked and hypocritical and
[2:40:45] indifferent your celestial body is down
[2:40:47] here regardless of how much you think is
[2:40:51] up there because the fruit that you bear
[2:40:53] before people proves where you're from
[2:40:56] are you ready so you are here what you
[2:41:01] are somewhere else
[2:41:05] that is deep that is deep that is deep
[2:41:11] your life you live here is just
[2:41:14] reflecting what your inheritance is when
[2:41:19] you leave here oh praise be to Jesus
[2:41:23] hallelujah
[2:41:25] what kind of inheritance he
[2:41:28] predestinated according to the purpose
[2:41:29] of him who look at all things he said no
