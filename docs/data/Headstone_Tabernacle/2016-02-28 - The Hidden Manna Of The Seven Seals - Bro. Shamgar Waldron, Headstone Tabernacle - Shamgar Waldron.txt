we have an open book this morning a amen amen well I didn't hear Too Much amen let me repeat it again we have an open book amen we don't have a closed book we have an open book so we thank God for that amen open up your Bibles then to Matthew the 24th chapter and I want to speak uh maybe in this I don't know amen all right just to read the word or so 24th chapter of Matthew I want to get there and also Revelation 6 6th chapter well how many love the word of God this morning amen and so I believe you come for a blessing amen and may God grant it unto us amen 24th chapter of St Matthew amen and if you have a a red letter Book Red Letter Bible you know that Jesus spake these words when he was here on Earth Amen in Matthew 24 now the 24 Matthew The Book of Matthew and the 24th chapter uh the prophet call it the doctor's book amen that's how the prophet give it the name he call it the doctor's book Matthew 24 where doctor times the pain when it's time for birth for a woman to be delivered amen amen amen so we time a little pain here this morning by God's grace all right does everybody have it all right let's bow our heads Heavenly Father we open up the pages of this book Lord you are the author of it and it was wrote by the Holy Spirit Spirit holy men of God spake as they were moved and written wrote by the spirit of God father as it's open before thee now breathe on it just one more time and Quicken it Lord to our hearts and quickness to it I ask it in jesus' name amen 24th chapter of Matthew Jesus speaking and Jesus went out and departed from the temple and his disciples came to him for to show him the building of the temple and Jesus said unto them see not all these things verily I say unto you there shall not be left here one stone upon another that shall not be thrown down and as he sat upon the Mount of Olives the disciples came unto him privately saying tell us when shall these things be question number one when shall uh these things be see that's question number one and one shall what shall be the sign of thy coming question number two and of the end of the world question number three amen now the prophet told us in that verse there the the disciples was asking the Lord three questions uh be seated so I explain just a little bit as I go along I have a unusual way of doing things here a little way that God give me and I like to read the scriptures and kind of explain what I'm talking about amen three questions here in the first three verses here of Matthew 24 and question one number one the disciples call him privately and ask him they were showing him the the building of the temple that Solomon building yes amen and that was a magnificent structure there it was beautiful the way it was build it was builded by a plan amen it it was builded by a pattern it was pattern of something that Moses pattern on Earth and Moses got the pattern from Heaven amen and so it was uh real good structure the way it looked and the disciples passing by and and they showed him the building of the temple and he says don't look at these things and he he begin to prophesy concerning it and he said there wouldn't be one stone left upon another that won't be thrown down amen amen amen friend uh may I say don't uh fasten your eyes and heart on any worldly thing Co will be finished in a little while can me say Amen we'll be finished in a little while amen and the next question they ask him is what will be the sign of your coming amen friend that was question number two and if you notice then and you understand and be spiritual enough brother Brandon preached the sign of his coming in the message called the flashing red light sign of his coming amen that was the answer to question number two amen friend let me repeat that again question number two is what the prophet preached to you in your age the message entitled the flashing red light sign of his coming amen and the prophet said in that the train is in the block can we say praise the name of the Lord because that sign is the day of Noah is that right friend train is in the block that's question number two and question number three and what shall be the sign of thy coming and of the end of the world amen amen and Jesus in question number three give them a sign of a victory right Hallelujah and he told them when you see the victory put forth its blood know that the time is at hand amen oh praise God let's go on into reading ver verse four and Jesus answer and said unto them take heed that no man deceive you for many shall come in my name saying I'm Christ and shall deceive many amen seal number one [Applause] one amen and you shall hear wars and rumors of wars seated you be not troubled for all these things must come to pass but the end is not yet seal number two for nation shall rise against Nation kimdong against kimdong there shall be fings and pestilences and earthquakes in diverse places all these are the beginning of Sorrows amen and seal number three is put in there in that verse there for farming and seal number four is in the same verse for pestilences and death can we say Amen praise God a mystery is hidden there verse n then shall they deliver you up to be afflicted and shall kill you oh what nation of people he speaking to here Jews shall deliver you up shall kill you you shall be hated of all Nations for my name sake amen and then shall many be offended and shall betray one another and shall hate one another many false prophets shall rise and shall deceive many because iniquity shall abound the love of many shall whack cold amen seal number five amen friend yes sir but then he went on inside the verses as you read on down to speak a lot of things that come inside here I want to get on down now to the 27 verse Jesus he still speaking here these words are heard for as the lightning cometh out of the East and shine even unto the West so shall also the coming of the son of man be for where soever the carcasses there will the Eagles be gathered together amen hallelujah and they are here this [Applause] morning amen you realize you are sitting right in a prophetic scripture this morning amen oh wheresoever the carcass is the fresh kill meat the Eagles will be gathered together amen right here Among Us this morning amen friend amen all right verse 29 say immediately after the tribulation of those days shall the sun be darkened the moon shall not give a light the Stars shall fall from Heaven and the powers of the heaven shall be shaken if you notice he said immediately after the tribulation of those days you see this is the pre-tribulation of the Jewish people amen we have a tribulation that's coming up which is the Great Tribulation but it also had a pre-tribulation for the Jewish people that's right or that's the time when the hickler and them kill him that's a pre-tribulation for the Jewish people can we say amen and as we do understand the Jewish people again will be in another Great Tribulation amen amen friends under the six seal amen verse 30 say and then shall the appear the sign of the son of man in heaven and then shall all the tribes of the oat moan and they shall see the son of man coming in the cloud of heaven with power and great glory and he shall send his angels with a great sound of a trumpet and they shall gather together his elect from the Four Winds from one end of Heaven to the other amen so there's a six sealing there amen then he turns to a power now learn a pble of a fig tree when his branch is yet tender and put it forth leaves you know the summer is n so likewise he when you shall see all these things know that it is near even at the door verily I say unto you this generation shall not pass till all these things be fulfilled amen not the generation he was talking to amen amen but the generation that sees the victory Israel amen put for his blood amen friend amen that's the one he was referring this prophecy to the generation that see Israel go back to her Homeland and the Sixpoint Star of David flying again amen that's the generation he's talking about amen Heaven and Earth shall pass away but my words shall shall not pass away but of that day and hour knoweth no man know not the angels of heaven but my father only can we say amen amen to the word of God Revelation the 6th chapter amen and amen does the bride love the word she's a lover of the word and sixth chapter of Revelation now pass your blessing on to you I want you to read with me in the first uh 12 verses there of Revelation 6 let us read together and I saw when the lamb open one of the seals and I heard as it word the noise of Thunder one of the four be saying come and see and I saw and behold a white horse and he that sat on him had had a bow and a crown was given unto him and he went forth conquering unto conquer and when he had opened the second seal everybody reading well let me tell you the reason why I asked you to read it so that you get your [Music] blessing because it is said blessed is he that read it the words of this prophecy amen amen blessed is he did heer it that's the reason I tell you read it so your blessing will come upon you amen for the blessing is pronounced and if you don't read it you don't get the blessing amen let me read it here in Revelation chapter 1 for you so you understand amen verses 1 to three the revelation of Jesus Christ which God give unto him to show unto his servants things which must shortly come to pass and he send un signified by an Angel unto his servant John who bear record of the word of God and of the testimony of Jesus Christ and of all things that is saw blessed is he that read it and they did hear the words of this prophecy and keep those things which are written therein for the time is at hand amen do you understand now why I ask you to read it because blessed is he did hear it back in the Old Testament the minister the priests will come out before the people and he would take the Scrolls many of them could even read and the minister would take the Scrolls before the people and he would read from the Scrolls of the prophets before the people because many of them could not read so they couldn't get that blessing from Reading amen but it also say blessed is he that hear it amen if you cannot read you can hear and your blessing remain can we say Amen blessed is he that hear it amen friend and as long as if they couldn't read and they hear their blessing is equally the same amen amen friend and know it also went on to say and blessed is he that Heth the words of this prophecy the prophecies in the Book of Revelation blessed is he that hear them blessed is he that read them and also when you leave here after you have read and after you have heard blessed is he that keep them can we say praise the name of Hall that your blessing might continue when you leave church you keep the words can we say praise the name of the Lord blessed is he that keep them that keep the words of this prophecy praise God amen so we're going to read in the sixth chapter of Revelation and we're going to start from the first seal again everybody together and I saw when the lamb open one of the seeds and I heard as it were the noise of thunder another a great sword and when he had opened the third seal I heard the tid be say come and see and I beheld un low a black and he that sat on him had a pair of balances in his hand and I Heard a Voice in the midst of the Forbe say a measure of weight for a penny and and see thou heard not the oil and the wine and when he had opened the forth seal I heard the voice of the forth B say come and see and I look and behold a pale hor and his name that sat on him was death and Hell Followed With Him and power was given unto them over the fourth part of the earth to kill with sword and with hunger and with death and with the Beast of the earth and when he had opened the fifth seal I saw under the altar The Souls of them that were slain for the word of God and for the testimony which they held and they cried with a a loud voice saying how long oh Lord holy and true do thou not judge and avenge your blood on them that dwell on the earth and white robes were given unto every one of them and it was said unto them that they should rest yet for little season until your fellow servants also and their Brethren that should be killed as they were should be fulfilled and I beheld when he had opened the six seal and lo there was a great earthquake and the sun became a sackl of hair and the stars of Heaven fell unto the Earth even as vict tree casted her untimely fith when she is shaken of A Mighty Wind and the heaven departed as a scroll when it is rolled together and every mountain and Island will move out of their places and the kings of the earth and the great men and the rich men and the chief Captain and the Mighty Men And every born man and every free man hid themselves in the dens and in the rocks of the mountains and said to the mountains and rocks fall on us and hide us from the face of him that sited on the throne and from the Wrath of the Lamb amen look at them running at that time yeah running to the mountains and rocks and saying Fallen us hide us from the face of him that sit on the throne them that mock and scoff and laugh and make fun of the word of God can we say amen amen they'll be running the chief Captain and the chief magistrate and the head of the military and the amen all the big boys will be running at that time praise God Amen and uh Revelation 6 is the six seals but the seven seal is way over here in the eth chapter yeah of Revelation yes sir or the scene of the seven [Applause] seed amen John right in here yes sir Revelation 81 let's read it now and when he had open the seven seal there was silence in heaven about the space of half an hour amen nothing was said there about it your instinct that John wrote here was the scene that he saw in heaven can we say Amen there was silence in heaven sir of the space of a half an hour is that right friend the opening or the breaking of that seven seal may God the Lord Jesus Christ had the blessings to his holy word this morning amen and inaiah Isaiah 28 just a a little scripture for myself here and for everybody in the 20th chapter it says and the 10th verse for precept must be upon precept precept upon precept line upon line line upon line here a little and there a little amen oh praise the name of the Lord oh everybody happy this morning well you ought to be in the house of the Lord with joy joy unspeakable amen and full of glory amen you know that uh uh uh David said he was glad when to say unto him let us go in the house of the Lord amen and David have a way that uh the house of the Lord whenever he is's a go on there and he have a way when he when he see something that stimulates him amen and you see something that stimulate him he usually dance praise the name of the Lord amen and how many remembers then all Bible readers know there will be a time in Israel when the ark was away from them the ark was away it was in the hands of the Philistine amen because Israel had sinned and they had done wrong and so they lost the ark amen but there also was a time when the ark was coming back can we say Amen praise the name of the Lord when the ark when David saw the ark returning back in the midst of the people he dance in the spirit amen his cup run it over amen and I think that we should be as happy as David is today amen amen we should be as happy as David was as we can see in our day the word returning back in the bride can we say the name of the Lord amen the truths of the scriptures that was lost all down Through the Ages amen they got away from it and make denomination and organization and all sort of a thing was injected in there that was not right can we say Amen is that right friend but God promised that he will restore it in this last day and I think we should all be happy there to see the word returning again in our day blessed be the name of the Lord thank you Jesus amen you said have a happy spirit this morning to see these things taking place amen friend all right then so my subject this morning and the brother ask for a little title so I give him a little title and so the little title is the hidden Manor amen the hidden Manor that was hid in the seven seers oh praise God Amen friend they hidden man is sit in the Seven Seals the seven last Mysteries of the Bible praise the name of the Lord amen and so friends I like to just quickly explain here concerning in this Bible what we call the Bible amen and that's the way that everybody uh knew it by that name amen ever since I born as a little boy and my age is over 75 now but since I a little boy that's all I he them call it the Bible the Bible the Bible but God sent a prophet to give it a correct name can everybody say Amen and when brother brah arve on the scene yes sir he call it a book of redemption can we say praise the name of the Lord hallelujah call it the book of redemption and that's what it is it's a book of redemption with the mystery of redemption wrote in it how

the spoken word books and burn them and throw them away don't you have to worry about that because when God was writing the book amen God God have a memory am when God was writing the book in his mind amen he put your name on the book so you could burn this if you want you can thr it where if you want God have a memory hallelujah hallelujah oh blessed be the name of the Lord is that right oh blessed be the name of the Lord it's like the people of Israel as going back to the Homeland now and the Jews after being destroyed after being scattered amen amen to all the Nations under the world to Iran and Iraq and Europe and all those places and Poland and Russia and as many of you could call and they were blinded they were scattered can we say Amen but now they are Reg added according to God word they are back in their Homeland again but here's what the prophet says that they are back there and they don't know what tribe they are [Applause] from I want to show you how God knows they don't know what tribe they're from are you from the tribe of a Dan or the tribe of Judah they don't know all they know they are Jews but but they can't say what tribe they from but here what the prophet say but God knows the memory the memory is with God can we say amen God knows what tribe and then you see them in Revelation 7 being called in the tribal order can we say praise the name of the Lord hallelujah do you believe God know you this [Music] morning hallelujah amen and amen oh praise God so the book was actually planned written before the foundation of the world and here what brother BR said this book the bible really was written before the foundation of the world Christ being the lamb was slain before the foundation of the world and the members of his bride their names were put on the Lamb's Book of Life before the foundation of the world listen but it's been sealed up it's been sealed up and now it's being revealed whose names were in there and all about it what a great thing and John when he saw it he said everything in heaven everything under the Earth yeah everything heard him [Applause] say oh oh brother when John saw his name hallu it was a single worship not a group worship he said everything in heaven here I say a single worship amen if it was a group worship but I ask everybody to stand but this is a single worship one man saw his name there amen I can't ask everybody to stand cuz everybody isin seeing the [Applause] name glory to God hallelujah can we give the lot of [Applause] shout amen you see then why some people can't shout amen and amen John say everybody in haven't heard I are single [Music] [Applause] team oh praise God so I don't expect all the group to [Applause] showout amen amen and amen praise God notice this book of life now this lamb Book of Life you notice something here about the book like to explain it here before I get to my message amen how much time I have this morning plenty of time all right amen now the book is a book of redemption it was sealed with Seven Seals with your name in it amen amen and now in this book of of of uh Redemption there was a wisdom of God when he was writing the book he is the Fountain of wisdom amen and uh that's why pray Paul Paul said pray for wisdom and Revelation didn't just say pray for Revelation say pray for wisdom too because there's a wisdom of God with the Revelation amen and amen and uh the wisdom of God when he was writing the book amen and writing in the book The Plan of Redemption he wrote it in a Sevenfold manner sir he wrote the book of redemption in a Sevenfold mystery can many say Amen the prophet says a Sevenfold mystery Plan of Redemption it's a plan that God planed but he wrote it in a Sevenfold manner to hide it from the eyes of the wise and prudent they might read it but don't understand it amen amen friend praise the name of the Lord because it's sealed up and sealed away from unbelievers it is sealed from unbelievers that's right and reveal to Believers can we say amen amen hallelujah now you watch some of the wisdom that goes with the Revelation and uh when he wrote the book there are prophets in there all over the book the whole Bible is full of prophets and you know them you can call them Isaiah Ezekiel whatever you want to call n whoever amen friends it is full of prophets in the bible and Isaiah as I read from him this morning is one of the great prophets in the bible amen because we are told that he wrote have 66 chapters Amen in Isaiah and there are 66 books in the Bible amen but though he was a great prophet like many others you find that God a sort of a a single out three of them three prophets in the bible in particular that God single out to do certain things can we say amen amen and one of them was Moses and he singled out Moses and uh call him to write the first five books of the Old test which the rest of the books in the Old Testament is based on those first five books amen and that was Moses to write them amen and over in the New Testament he took the prophet [Applause] Paul to write the Epistles to the New Testament amen you see Paul writing to the church at Cent and different ones and wherever they were scattered am amen it is Paul that wrote those Epistles and do you believe that Paul was a prophet he was a prophet amen amen and the third Prophet is your Prophet amen so he took Moses to write the book books of the Old along with the other prophets amen and then it took Paul to write the Books of the new so that's what make the Bible old and new amen so this is old and this is new and then when you bring them together both old and new it make one Canon of scriptures one book that is how your Bible is amen and then God sealed the whole thing with seven seeds can we say praise the name of the Lord amen amen friend the entire book the whole Cannon of scriptures was sealed up with Seven Seals on the back side of the book praise the name of the Lord amen and amen so he took Moses to ride the old yes sir and he took Paul to write the new do you agree with that amen but the whole thing there was wrote mysterious it was wrote in symbols sir it was wrote in types it was wrote In Shadows it it was wrote in Parables it was wrote in wles can we say Amen do you believe that friend Paul wrote a lot of things in Mysteries is that right friend praise the name of the Lord you see that's the reason why the theologians and them get in trouble today amen because they can't understand the way it's wrote mysterious the book can we say amen hallelujah amen Hallelujah because it's wrote in symbols some wrote Parts is wrote In Time like the Book of Revelation that is only a book of symbols there's nothing wrote just outright like that but there are things that symbolize there like the seven gold and candlesticks and things like that symbolize the church can we say amen hallelujah is that right friend then you get Paul writing some of the Epistles in in the New Testament and he wrote them in Mysteries or for instance he say behold I show you a mystery we shall not all sleep but we shall all be changed can we say Amen is that right and some of the Mysteries the way he wrote it he particularly tell the people I don't want you to be ignorant of this mystery that blindness has happened to Israel can we say Amen is that right friend so you see it's Mysteries there in the New Testament amen and amen and then after God listen after God had Paul and had Moses both of them had the same experience seeing the pillar of fire can me say Amen it wasn't just wrote by education of man it wasn't just wrote by understanding of man it was inspired can we say Amen all the word of God is inspired how many agree with that say Amen all all all Every Word is [Applause] inspired all scripture was given by inspiration of God Amen and it's profitable for you is that right friend so after all the old was wrote and there was a time that the old was closing and there is a time that new have to be closed too can we say amen amen then God take the boat two halves go this is one half old this is another half new and God put the two halves together to make the whole book amen then he put Seven Seals around it on the back side of it can we say Amen is that right so here this Moses wrote the old Paul wrote the new but the whole things was seal up amen the whole thing was seal up so that nobody can know what those Mysteries are inside so we needed another Prophet Moses wrote it Paul wrote it God seal it up then we needed another Prophet to reveal it and there is where brother Brown Ministry come in to reveal the thing can we say Amen what was sealed up and what was closed [Applause] up amen hallelujah ain't that beautiful friend oh praise God I just warming [Applause] up amen and amen amen friend praise the name of the Lord amen so I just have to touch the wisdom of God I feel I didn't do justice to God if I don't touch the wisdom of God Amen now seal one page 119 I'm going to read this here for you amen it's such a beautiful thing all right want you to get this here amen and amen it's a beautiful thing here I want to read the wisdom of God to write this book see it's not a guess work here neither this salvation that God give you by his grace is not something you stumble into by luck or by chance this thing was pre-planned by God Amen you stumbling to nothing here you're here for a purpose can we say Amen that by chance you get here amen and amen amen oh praise the name of the Lord oh yes here it is now here's what the prophet say God runs his messages throughout the Bible by numerals of the Bible amen and amen let me let me quote it here from the seals amen and brother talking about the roll and the scroll here he see and you roll it up in this this manner he he was demonstrating at the end there's a little piece sticking out like that he's talking about the Scrolls in the Old Testament which is the seal say amen and he says now you roll it up that way then that's the first part of the book then the next seal is rolled up in this manner right side by side amen praise the Lord yes Hallelujah side by side he said but now I want you to bear in mind there is a church and a bride and you you always have to make it run in trees yes sir fours is wrong trees so God runs his his messages in numeral three 7 10 12 24 40 50 those unbroken numbers the Bible That's how God runs his messages in numerals of the Bible in those numbers and you get that that anything that flies off of one of them numbers you better watch it won't come out right that's right on the next thing you have got to bring it right back here to where you start from amen so we we have that understanding right here now that God run his messages throughout the Bible by numerals amen and that is threes and fives and 12s and 24 amen 24 Elders around the throne and 50 yes sir and seven [Applause] and seven is number of completion how many believe that say amen and so I'm just giving you an understanding of how these things are wrote in the Bible and therefore that is the reason why you have in the Bible and on the back side of the book Seven Seals amen see this how we running this message now Seven Seals you have seven trumpets yeah praise God Amen friend you have seven Church ages watch all the sevens in the Bible and say bring down the sevens for you and you have Seven Stars yes sir you have seven spirits Seven Stars in his right hand amen you have seven eyes on the lamb you have seven horns on the lamb can we say amen amen see there's God numbers now yeah Seven Seals seven trumpets seven vials seven plagues all in the Book of Revelation oh praise God are you following me friend Hallelujah are in the the the numeral here now of God's sens this is the way that he run his his messages throughout the Bible now seven eyes in the lamb seven [Applause] watches oh you hear me say seven watches seven watches is seven Church ages can we say Amen each age was called a watch and why was the ages called seven watches why was the ages called watches here's why because the belie there were Believers in every age that was watching for the coming of the Lord can we say Amen they were watching for the coming of the Lord they believe that he would come in their time the Believers down in other ages believed that they were come he was Jesus was coming back in their time but he did not come in their time is that right friend but let me tell you this it's your time he is coming in your time is in the seven watch he come how many Say Amen praise God in the seven watches when he comes he did not come in the first age he did not come in the second although they believe he will come and they died in faith believing can we say Amen but he did not come in their age but friends don't you take a chance on it it's your age he would [Applause] come he comes in the seventh watch and there will be will be Believers watching for his coming they will be watching and ready when he arrive here you believe that amen so let me quickly get through these seven you see so the whole plan mystery Plan of Redemption wrote in a Sevenfold manner Seven Seals seven trumpets seven Thunders seven vials listen to this seven seats of Mercy praise God seven seats of Mercy you believe it friend oh go down in Leviticus you'll see the seven

Junction the seventh and the last Junction is the one you and I are bearing record of today after this there'll be no more we are living in the time when the handwriting is on the wall for the ending of time back in the Bible you look through the scriptures you who read your Bible the handwriting was on the wall for Nations and certain cities like capernium and different ones the handwriting was on the wall for Nations or cities amen but now the handwriting is on the wall for the ending of time it say amen and amen oh but God is good to us he is good to us amen now let me get over to my message kind of feel warm enough hallelu hallelujah hallelujah amen I have to see how much time I have all right 20 to one I think I can do it in that 20 minutes I hope it's so praise God now it this my brothers know amen the excuse me what's my subject here now the hidden revelation the hidden manner the hidden manner of the Seven Seals so now want you to know what the man is so you understand I'm reading here from the Pam message that this is revealed here amen and down here now here unto the angel of the Church of pamus right the prophet say here the message is addressed to the leader of the church God help that guy that will pull away from that message but it was given to the Angel and the angel was in the hand of under his own control the angel was given its light and power from him from his right hand amen amen amen they are his right hand that is they in supreme power while they are here on the earth the Angels the stars in his right hand while they are here in the earth like brother Braham like Paul like irus Martin IIA while they were here on the earth they were in power amen praise the name of the Lord while they are here on Earth because they are the lights from him see he gets the glory all the [Applause] time they are the lights from him given the light to that church age therefore it's the message to every age is addressed to the angel of the to to the star of that age because he's responsible the angel of the church is responsible if he doesn't preach the word amen amen and the angel will have to answer to God in the Judgment amen now so the angel of God the messenger to the church is responsible if he preaches not the word now the hidden manner let's give the interpretation the best we can what does hidden manner type what does his manner type hidden manner was a manner that was kept or showbread a shoe bread in the Bible that was only for the priests and the prophet asked how many knows that they had a bread for the congregation but there was a special bread for the priest can we say amen hallelujah amen there was a table of Sho bread in the Holy Place amen and only the priest can eat that every Sabbath when they change it the priest eat it can we say Amen but the the hidden manner this is a special bread a special bread hidden manner what is it who is our manner Christ is our man [Applause] amen praise God you believe that Christ is our Mana Jesus said he was the bread of life that come from God out of Heaven A man what is the manner the manner that isn't given to all what is the hidden manner the hidden manner is the manner that isn't given to all the [Applause] congregation amen hallelujah what is it it is the Revelation that is poured out upon the angel of the church can we say amen amen now friends you could understand where brother Bram is standing and the angel of the church the hidden manner is the Revelation that is poured out to the angel of the church can we say [Applause] Amen come on get it now let me repeat it again I want you to get it the hidden manner is a special manner yes sir it is not given to all the congregation Hallelujah it is given to the angel of the age can we say Amen what is my subject the hidden manner of the Seven [Applause] Seals given to the angel of the age can we say Amen can we say praise the name of the Lord hallelujah the hidden manner of these Seven Seals yes sir was given to the angel of the [Applause] age the Revelation is poured out upon the angel of the age what Revelation the revelation of the word the revelation of the word is given to the angel of that age amen for it is hid from anywhere else right Hallelujah it is hid from everything and R back the hidden manner that's the reason it's addressed to the angel of the age and brother say you get it how many get it hallelujah hallelujah amen what is it then it's a little bigger Revelation a little higher a further light a further revelation of what Christ is can we say amen hallelujah hallelujah and here what the prophet say I wonder if Luther recognized that I wonder if Westley recognized that wonder if St Martin recognized it wonder if irus recognized it in his day well if they didn't recognize it which I believe they did I'm going to tell you brother Bram recognized [Applause] it amen amen friend oh praise God the hidden man here he went on to say here's what it is it's a little something special what is the special the blessings of the Holy Ghost no no that's for the whole congregation but the hidden manner was a special Revelation given to the angel of the age because he had to teach the others Oh Praise God Amen friend did you hear that the angel of the age is the pastor here the angel of this church not of the of your the church is a pastor [Music] here and he will get the hidden manner because he had to teach you he has to get the hidden Manner and he have to know where the manner is to give to the people can we say Amen oh praise God oh blessed be the name of the Lord so let me read it again that you understand friend the blessing of the Holy Spirit I say everybody Holy Spirit fall on you you shout you praise God that's a blessing the blessing of the Holy Ghost that's for the whole congregation but the hidden manner was a special Revelation because he had to teach the others amen what was it it was a little more knowledge of the script here that he could teach others he's supposed to teach is that right so you'll never live no higher than your pastor amen amen you'll never live no higher than your pastor you just remember that cuz he's the Shepherd that feeds you and if he's a shepherd He has got to know where the manner is to free she amen a little special light little more Revelation amen friend that's what the hidden man is so when I read that you could understand what the title of my message is the hidden man of the of the of the Seven Seals was given to who the angel of the [Applause] age amen friend the hidden man of the seven SE mystery of the book of redemption was hid from everybody else can we say amen and it was given to the angel of the age Hallelujah that he can come and teach us hallelujah so when he was bringing forth the revelation of the seals he commend singing yes and he said we love singing there's nobody love singing like a Christian is that right friend amen but he say now we in something else he says we in the word can we say amen he said we in teaching now a different anointing from preaching amen friend he got the hidden Manner and he had to come and teach us the bride in this age can we say amen hallelujah hallelujah nobody got the hidden manner but the prophet that's Glory praise God glory to God in hallelujah amen friend look let me get something for you amen remember friends Hallelujah there was a manner that fed the whole mixed multitude of the children of Israel I want you to get this and that manner God pour it down at night time and they had to go very in the early in the

day cuz if they do that it get contaminated it get wiggle tails in it is that right F and the Mana stank it wasn't no good when they leave it over can we say Amen there were some back in the Bible that try to gather it the next day and they find well it was stink can we say amen amen and if they didn't gather it between those times what happened there it melt away that was the manner but every day God pour it down fresh upon them is that right friend Hallelujah all right but listen something Hallelujah and that's the way God fed the children of Israel for 40 years in the wilderness that's right all they eat is Mana till they get fed up Aid [Applause] too amen amen hallelujah de War us don't get stale on the word you [Applause] know Hallelujah don't you get St don't you get fed up to a place that you can't a really it it a exciting you the word said excite you all the time don't you get steal in it amen amen friend hallelu amen friend hallelujah it's like the story told of the
