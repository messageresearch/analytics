[Applause] they asked Jesus some questions and Jesus was trying to bring an answers to the end of the world he said You shall hear wars and rumors of wars he said not yet he said earthquakes not yet nations against Nations not yet he said this gospel must be preached and then the end shall come so don't watch outside watch inside for the gospel to be preached then you know what's coming don't bother about wars and rumors and Wars don't wor about financial crisis and this happening watch the church to see if the church is getting stronger watch what's happening in service to see if we being empowered watch your life to know that fire is coming to your seed water is coming to your seed God is coming to you oh Hallelujah Glory are you ready you may be seated just think 400 years or how much years between Malachi and and Matthew Pharisees sadus set up and yet God waiting for the appointed time Hallelujah he a man doubting that God could do Miracles and here Elizabeth she got pregnant and baby hasn't moved as yet and here it is Mary because she a virgin shall conceive was the prophecy and here she steep into her position I like that Mary Mary you see you can't hide anymore you have to step into your position you you got to move you got to step into what God called you to do and when you step into God called you to do 10 things going to begin to happen so Mary I could step into her position her position was in Isaiah 96 a virgin shall conceive and that was the only one could fit into that position one virgin one name one virgin one name and that's you inside of there the only you could fit into the position that God ordained for you the devil is a liar Dev is that nobody can take your place you don't let the devil bang your mind you have to step into your position and whenever steep into a position which is the scripture Oh Glory Hallelujah my no feeling good your position is scripture you have to find the scripture to fit inside Hallelujah and when she found the scripture the anointing Came Upon her she was ready for the angel glory in other words God broke up the season by introducing the angel Gabriel appearing to Mary to say you are highly favored amen hallelujah and the Lord is with thee and blessed the among women and so forth and all Mary had one question how shall these things be after all this talk and word what what going to happen how how it's going to fulfill in my life how it's going to be inter he said don't worry about that that's the Holy Ghost the Holy Ghost did you could you have somebody say holy ghost the Holy Ghost going to come upon you and power going to power going to power going to once the Holy Ghost come upon you that's why isah acts 1 say you shall receive power after the Holy Ghost you see people afid this Holy

going save it when you're dying it's going stop the devil flying but it's good enough for me we talking about this old time Holy Ghost this old time religion oh going revive you you're going to Quicken you it going to inspire you you're going to leave it with a fresh charge you may be seated you know when your cell phone battery run down you have to get charge and you had to plug it in and

learning to depend upon this word Isaiah 40 reading verse 28 to 31 Isaiah 59 1 verse verse 19 and Matthew 13 ver vers 24- 30 reading Isaiah 40 read in verse 28 hast thou not known hast thou not heard that the Everlasting God the Lord the creator of the ends of the Earth fainteth not neither is weary there is no searching of his understanding he giveth power to the faint and to them that have no might he increaseth strength Hallelujah even the youth shall faint and be wary and the young men shall utterly fall but they that wait upon the Lord shall renew their strength Hallelujah they shall Mount up with wings as eagles they shall run and not be wary they shall walk and not faint Isaiah 59 verse 19 so shall they fear the name of the Lord from the West and His glory from the rising of the sun when the enemy shall come in like a flood the spirit of the Lord shall lift up a standard against him Matthew Chapter 13 we want to read from verse 24 another Parable put he forth un them saying Matthew 13 who 24 Matthew is right after the last book of the Old Testament another Parable putting forth unto them saying the Kingdom of Heaven is lightened unto a man which sowed good seed in his field and while men slept his enemy came and SW tears among the wheat and went his way when the blade was sprung up and brought forth fruit then appear the tears also so the servant of the householder came and said unto him sir this th not so good seed in thy field from when then had the tears he said unto them an enemy had done this the servant said unto him will thou then that we go and gather them up he said nay least while you gather up the tears you root up also the wheat with them let both grow together until the Harvest and in the time of harvest I will gather I will say to the Reapers gather you together first tears buy them in bundles to burn them but gather the wheat into my band let's pray father we thank you for your word interpret it to our hearts bless it bless those who would be hearing it in Jesus name we ask it amen and amen you may be seated praise God blessed be the name of the Lord It's hallelujah it's great to be here amen looking forward for a wonderful time in the word in the Lord we already know that God this Bible is God in print so what you hear is the word of the Lord what you saw is Jesus in red speaking this Parable hallelujah hallelujah a man saw his field and the enemy came and SW it and just walk away disappeared and he ain't seen anything he so on the silence too Hallelujah just disappeared and when it begin to grow the man came and said but hey you so good seeds here how come these tears doing here he say your enemy did it should I cut them up no no no I don't want one miss I don't want to reap I don't want to pull out a wrong wheat isn't that right so I have a title they that wait upon the Lord that's what I have this morning a title they that wait upon the Lord I have a subject waiting on God and waiting for God this is the process of character development and have an inspiration cutting you down to the word only Hallelujah see we got to be cut we got to be shaved a lot of people don't like the cutting they like the Shaving they like the chicken and chips gospel you know take your pack and go and so on but it have where you have to be cut down to the word only because this bride is going to be the word hallelujah how many believe that so brother Bram and tiar age you were sharing this I Know Thy Works love service Faith thy patience thy works and the last be more than the first I Know Thy works the Son of God said believe me for the work sake he put an emphasis on his own Works while on Earth The Works that he did were ordained of God to inspire faith in him it was a great part of his ministry and the Holy Spirit in Apostle Paul said we are his workmanship created in Christ Jesus and the good works which God had ordained that we should walk in them these Works were to inspire faith in him as they show forth the relationship to him that Paul described as created in him now works will never take the place of faith in God for our salvation but works will show forth our faith already placed in him good works won't save you but even if a man is not saved he ought to do good works and do the best he can what is horrible in the sight of God for men to do evil works and then say that they're doing the will of God that is what the Bishops and popes and hierarchy of Rome were doing they were killing Ming doing all manner of evil in the name of the Lord deliver out lives exactly opposite to what the word teaches in that evil day those True Believers shown like a light in a dark place as they continually did good for they returned curs him with blessing they did Tru to honor God even though they many died for it amen in this verse here we go he commended his children because they were living changed lives I'm not hearing you I want to say Amen right with me with the word now they were living change lives say it change lives change lives say it again change lives change lives that is what they will live and change lives okay watch their Works testify to a new spirit within them men saw their good works not hear their good talks but they saw their good works and glorify God are you with me no now we want to be that kind of people Hallelujah all right if you are Christian you are going to do what is right your Works will show what your heart is Right amen and it won't be something you put on for you will do his will when no one but God sees you that's why you hear me say you are what you are when you're by yourself because you could pretend to this you could act this way you could show this way but when you by yourself that's you in All Your Glory Hallelujah are you with me I know your love and service faith and patience you will note that their love is placed between works and service and that is the right place for it because without love our works are not accepted before God you're working because you're doing work like I asked myself a question if a husband is serving love and a wife or or a wife is serving the husband and she's not serving love how how does she feel she feel like a slave let me say that again if the wife is serving the husband and he's not serving her love she feel like a slave she feel she working in the kitchen working in the home there's no love coming there and if a husband Serv in love and the wife not serving respect he feel like a [Music] nut are you with me oh praise the name of the Lord so without love I am nothing whatever I do would profit me nothing unless it's done in love am now you can see right here that these Believers weren't in that nickan class that did works as a means of Salvation to be add B by men but they did their works out of love of God that were shed abroad in their hearts by the Holy Ghost isn't that right amen now I want to give a warning right here it is concerning the last days that because of abounding iniquity the Bible said the love of many with wax coal so a church on fire is a rare thing yes I'm saying people on fire that's a great thing when you see Believers on fire that's contrary to what the scripture was saying you are breaking the barrier the song barrier because the Bible prophesy the love of many will wax cold they will still go to church but they cold still Shake hand but they cold God bless you but they cold God the love of men because of iniquity oh Hallelujah are you ready because in the lisian or last Church age self love uhhuh and love for material things will make take the place of the true love of God yeah that self love make it take plenty selfies you like yourself I didn't mean to hit it too hard but that that's a new word selfies selfie Bible talk about self love love for matur thing will take the place of the true love of God we need here we go to guard against the power of sin in these last days amen you can't just walk unguarded you have to understand it's a Warfare amen Oh Glory to God you shout you jump you feel inspired inside of here and the devil just Bing come on cuz you shouted cuz you got to be kidding that devil is spotting to take away your shout while you shouting here the devil is spting to take away your joy to wipe the smile from off your face to give you a thr but we going to keep on [Applause] smiling let the people don't want to say Amen on that one you were thinking about that devil don't think about that devil think about your joy that's not the devil joy that is your joy that is your peace that is your strength [Applause] am Glory you need to guard against the power of sin in the last days so many are getting so hard so many are getting so hard because they haven't realized the effect of this yes last day Spirit why I think the sodomite so anointed now and free to come out why they was in the closet all because they know wrong all but they're coming out now why it's a last day Spirit why because Jesus said as one days the son of man so as one a son of Manor so will be the last days so we are coming right back to a spirit that coming back upon people that was there back then so the last day spirit is coming back but there was Abraham the elected there was Elohim Dynamics failed I will return unto thee according to the time of life and there was a change of body St was changed and in this last day there's going to be a change of body there's going to be a Rapture I'm not hearing you I'm not hearing you so they are getting in their spirit and we have to get in our spirit in the spirit of the coming of the Lord oh give the Lord some praise His people hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah Glory you be seated what PR mess called recognizing to message he said just the other day Russia was a bunch of barari Ians but now there so much Advance because they recognize their position and look how anointed the president of Russia is because he have a place and a part to play in this whole program of God oh Hallelujah understand this the judgment is about to be released but before that every Angel have to stop the wars stop every disaster stop this and stop that until the angel from the East having the seal the Living God to put a mark upon those that sigh and cry that means somebody going to be hungering thirsting groaning travailing Glory [Applause] Hallelujah don't let your wife zap you don't let your husband zap you don't let your children zap you from knowing the mystery of God and the will of God for your life oh glory to God remember this Jesus said they eat they drank they build they got married in other words no man living no evidence that something Supernatural was about to Break Forth they were doing the thing they were going to the bank they were going to work they were paying their bills but I miss all that natural walk there was a supernatural something that was about to unfold that the world know nothing about fire was coming trust was coming power [Applause] Hallelujah Glory Glory Hallelujah glory to God you may be seated and people sit in this mess 40 years thinking they're safe because they believe a prophet but the Raptor is a revelation come on say somebody the Raptor is not sitting in church the Raptor is a revelation and walk with God and had a testimony that he pleased god without faith you cannot please him because he

Glory Glory Hallelujah you may be seated oh my brother Bram I know your service Jesus said he that is greatest of all is servant to all a wise man commented on that saying here's what he said only history will prove the truth truth of that dictum that man was right all the truly great men of history have been servants they who demanded to be served they who oppress who oppressed they who always s to be at the head have gone down in shame even the very rich are condemned by God when they have not use their wealth right look into history and you would find that truly great were those who serve others history can never Acclaim those for whom much was done but it will forever praise those who did much for others and that's why B said perfect eternal life is when you could live for others now let us apply that to ourselves even the son of man came not to be ministered unto but to minister so we have to follow that example see him as he bows himself over the feet of the Apostles and washes their tired de feat he said you know now what I'm doing you don't know now what I'm doing but you shall know Hereafter amen but what you see me doing you ought to also do he became a servant in order that God could Elevate him to the highest Heights and one day in the Judgment of the Saints we going to hear him say Well done good and faithful servant ENT th into the joy of the Lord it is hard to be always a servant but those who spend and are spent for others will one day be seated with him in his throne it will be worth it all then let us labor for the master from the daal set and Son let us talk of all this wonders love and care and when all our life is over and our work on Earth is done and the role is Called Up Yonder I'll be there I know your faith now he does not say here as he did to the chur and pamus you hold my faith he's not talking about his faith now he is commending them for their faithfulness and as he does he also mentioned patience now faithfulness and patience go together in fact patience is the outcome of faithfulness for in James 1:3 the TR of your faith work at patience there is absolutely no other way to gain patience it has to come by the trial of your faith amen Romans 53 tribulation work at patience hallelujah how highly God regards this outworking of our patience is seen in James 1:4 but let patience have a perfect word that you may be perfect and entire lacking nothing amen I read that from memory when I took my glass can see anything God's will for us here we go God's will for us is perfection how many believe that and that Perfection is [Music] patience waiting on God and waiting for God this is the process of character development that is where I get that from waiting on God and waiting for God this is the process of character development so he gave Noah 120 years he gave Abraham 25 years he gave Israel 400 years he gave the exci of my room 10 is you have a way of giving time on things to test Fai and develop character there is no other way for it to be done that's why trials must come because character is not a gift character is a victory the tests have to be given for you to overcome could I hear a shout on that because this is what the bride is for to be flesh of his flesh bone of his bone word of his word characterized by him other than that you are the same old you p a New Dress p a new tie same old you same you put some paint on you change your hairstyle and so on same you but when character come it's the same outside you about to change your tie but you on the inside change that's what the problem was Peter didn't know his emotions would overtake him Lord I die for you that song very anointed inspiring every disciple else everybody else was impressed with that whoa here Peter boy courageous man Jesus said you n me three times no that is not really a good encouragement amen for such a bold step of fi you die for you night of the crucifixion somebody say you are one of them I saw you in service they said no no no no no mistake and dty amen person P you are one disciples no that of course not I looking disciples do you think I looking like that well the third one identify him he said a curse everybody know disciples don't curse right so Peter making sure I am no then the cockro Peter wept bitterly oh Peter was broken Peter that that but you see Jesus told him other things too he said after you are converted strengthen the Brethren the devil want to SI it like wheat but I pray for you already you are covered man you are covered man you are covered oh oh you should Shen that you already covered man you're going to make it glory to God hallelujah man brother Steven bought a tremendous exaltation until night pray meeting tell him keep that more bring him back again about God's DNA God G inside of you God put that DNA to come back that D have a return ticket on it devil don't know that God only lose you here for season and time but they have a return ticket on it

home because staying home have no promise but you see that water a angel has comeing trouble of water I want to make it maybe if not this service next I'm going to make it and he keep pressing brother pressing not one year character development 38 years the man of persistence the man of belly the man of perseverance nobody can see that he just coming they're seeing the same clothes and the same shoes or whatever it is but he have something in him that God recognizes and when Jesus come Jesus passed this one Jesus passed that one because they didn't have the character like what that man had he didn't have a big problem he had like a prostrate problem but Jesus bypass harder conditions to go to that one man and say will you be made whole will you be made whole and the man said I have no no man to put me in he accustomed saying this thing he accustomed talking this trying to get him Jus said I ain't come to ask you that I ain't come to ask you what if you want to go in that water I am

break through you got to speak [Applause] it I am believing after this service lives forever changed oh glory amen sometime from that time something just take a turn and your life take a turn you make a right choice to come today a right turn to say Amen a right turn to worship a right turn to raise your hand and something happen in your life that change you forever oh glory to God that people something happened way years ago something negative and that put their life in a spiral some people make wrong choices wrong decision never recover but thank God for his grace and mercy give us an opportunity to repent give us an opportunity to make things right and we know ACC to Romans 8:28 all things work together for good to them that love God to them to them to them who are decalled according to his purpose according to what your purpose no his purpose it have a his purpose for your life you hearing what I'm saying it have a his purpose for your life I'll say it again his purpose his purpose for your life Oh Glory to God therefore you are here to connect to his purpose for your life you want to do this you want to do that but there's a his purpose for your life and once you in that purpose nothing could stop you no weapon form against you could Prosper nothing could hinder you glory to God I'll never leave you never forsake you glory to God because you have his purpose for your life Samson had a purpose to defeat the Philistines to do this and do that Samson fell Samson fail but God had a further purpose for Samson Samson had the DNA in him he had God's gen in him oh Hallelujah he was predestinated he was elected he wasn't permanently backd some people have you like if you backslide you're permanently so you're sick you're permanently so forget that this whole world is temporary so sickness is temporary back is temporary bad feeling temporary bad marriage temporary too bad relationship temporary some rten children temporary too Let the Fire Fall on them children you see them get cure all those bad behav ones let God presence coming upon him all the foolish smoke out God take the dynamite and just hey blow it out Hallelujah we have a dynamite our God is a consuming fire you know he has used lights you know not flashlight and torch light you know real light fire light fire has burn burn the snakes out of your heart burn the snakes out of your spirit burn the snakes out of your soul Glory Hallelujah what do you say over just now demons crying [Music] [Applause] out I know you don't know what I'm talking about when Jesus start to walk the earth what thing happening the demons start to cry out when Paul start to walk demons crying out one time the demon one one want to do like what they're doing this demon say Paul I know Peter I know but who are you I don't know you I recognize the authority in those Sons there that's the demons talking now I understand the power and the Authority because they are ambassadors of the throne and ambassadors representatives of the Kingdom them like hierarchy his kingdom people God sent an ambassador isn't that right when the government of train sent an ambassador to London or ambassador to America or wherever they represent the country they represent the government they represent the authority and when God send his men out they ambassad of the throne as my father sent me so sender you as my father oh Hallelujah Glory Glory Hallelujah glory to God so therefore Satan is about to experience something that he never experienced before the manifestation of the sons of God when we going coming back to take back what he have listen take it back you know Adam lost it it slipped out of Adam hand the book The Authority eternal life in itance slip out Adam hand and butam came to bring it back Mighty angel came down with the book but the bread of life but the shout is not right to bring forth the briide here we are feeling on the unfailing body word of the son of man here we are feeling on the bread of life glory to God hallelujah seven tunders voices what for to gather the bride together to give the bride feet to should might help repare the bride not the church the church could play church but you come here you hear what the bride needs praise God you have to understand how the people feel in times pass amen how God looking forward for this bride amen that'll make him proud Hallelujah and brother says a woman reflects the man right his ambition his ideal and so on the woman a man choose isn't that right so the bride that Christ choose is to reflect [Music] him if the bride do her own thing that's problems she is on her own all right so God's nature is to warn a man before judging him isn't that right you always give warning we have a responsibility we are responsible and God has put us here on the earth okay watch for a reason and that reason that he has put us therefore we are responsible to him for that reason you should go to him and find out what he wants you to do and if you don't if you went to work for a man give you a job on a ranch or something you went on to the B sit down there well you must go and ask him what he wants you to do and then if you're working for a man find out what your duty is Lord what would you have me to do why am I here if it to be a housewife this worship whatever God's want you to do then you do the very best you know how to do it excuse me no matter how little it is you must do it now listen to this he does not always strike when he Wars I want you to watch this quotation God gives a warning but he doesn't always strike the same time he wants did you notice that and then he doesn't strike he sends a warning he said now watch but that Prophet if he's Vindicated is got to come to pass there's only one thing can stop it is a quick repentance like Abraham God told Abraham your si has a J in a Strange Land and because of iniquity of the amorites here we go is not yet full so God knew that cup was going to be full he was speaking with his prophet he said you see that cup of the amorites down there their iniquity is not yet filled up so God will just judge because things said and what not no there's a cup of wickedness a cup of evil that God looking to get filled up and the filling it up they year in year out and when that full then God will strike amen the iniquity is not yet full so God himself have a [Applause] timing Hallelujah a lot of people feel to get away but God have a timing when he does his thing isn't that right so what's something now talking about David trying to do God a service outside his being his Will and David now got a revelation he claim to bring back the house of go the The Ark isn't that right but but said he revealed his word only in its season Martin Luther read the same Bible we did Wesley read the Bible we did Pentecost read the same Bible Jesus read the same Bible but watch but they fail to see the hour so only when the time comes the opening of the word for the season and time God breaks what needs to break amen isn't that right that's right so watch God Reveals His word in the season and to whom he choose to reveal it to God chooses who he reveals it to he reveals them as he will as his chosen people his chosen people so who it is Will dare correct him and said now Lord you made a mistake by putting this man in the ministry who is there to correct God and say God you make a mistake by putting to over in the ministry I to put my name inside of it this man doesn't believe like we believe who is going to tell God he is wrong in it it would be take somebody a little more delinquent than I am to tell him that he knows what he's doing he knows who to choose who not to choose what to do when to do it no matter how much we think that a certain person is qualified to do a certain job God know who is qualified for the time and the season and so forth isn't that right so David got a revelation look like a man get a revelation a great man like God chosen King greatest King fresh Revelation freshly anointed and he said but it was wrong that's a great thing I'll deal with our subject trying to do God a service without it being God Called to do it so David got a revelation but he was not a prophet Nathan was the prophet isn't that right but the king got the Revelation and David never consulted Nathan the prophet he consulted his theologians the Army his boys his- workers his friends his family he consulted them is not right so instead of asking the source that he should have asked he consulted his captains because he had become a king and he followed that line of thinking his chief captains and great man now his intention was good his motive was good his objective was good to bring a Revival to the city but he never consulted the way God told him to do it so there's a way that God have his things to do so we can't go fanatical and cranky about getting this done we have to wait upon the Lord to catch the way it has to be done because God tell Joshua we have not been here before amen isn't that right and therefore we have to walk reverently isn't that right so said the bride hasn't Revival us yet there's no Revival no manifestation of God to stir the bride we are looking for it it will take those seven tunders to wake her up again he promised it if the church will forget the Creeds forget their dogas and plead the promise it'll become effective to them yes so now going back no matter how sincere what good motives what good objectives how people want those things and see the need for it there is a will of God to be carried out and no matter how much is needed how much everybody agrees it's needed how much that is the truth there is one thing to find out is it the will of God and listen he consulted his military forces and not even considered their godsent messenger of the hour so therefore B was talking about a man he's talking about um intellectual man a Pentecostal coming from Africa and he told them that this ecumenical move as a thing of God and all of them is coming back even the Catholic church is going to come back to it original condition all speaking with tongues and a man I didn't know sometime you PL a Siege you don't know what's going to happen Hallelujah but the president the Full Gospel businessman as soon as the speaker sat down he said I am prone not to say things against our speaker but that ain't the way but brandham said it would happen he said it would lead to the mark of the beast he said but brandham don't know what he's talking about he said well we believe he does and Chicago said how many here would like for me to come up and give my version of it they begin screaming and shouting see you are planting seeds you don't know what going to happen just keep laying out the seed when an hour come like Thomas he was a last one to see the Lord he said he was a little late but when they see the things here we go that's predicted saying thus say the Lord happens then they say give us of your oil so right now everybody feeling fine because things they begin to break yet but when things begin to happen then they realize they are the oil down the oil gone down they shorten oil and they come in and say give us of your oil now here this now from question and answers and yeah wise virgin who had oil in your Lambs Raptor in faith believ in all the signs and wonders watch and watch and these five cut out the remnant was taken away and the rest of them still virgins will not be lost but we go through the tribulation period and Jesus said give us they say give us your oil we want the whole Holy Ghost now my we recognize we are not the Holy Ghost and we don't even have the Holy Ghost watch now anyone knows that the Holy Ghost James 5 for all knows it represent the Holy Ghost the oil and that's the reason we we anoint with oil represent the Holy Ghost the all the spirit now hear this part they want part I want to get to now these had the Holy Ghost and were Sanctified these are Sanctified plus the Holy Ghost go buy from those who sell to you and the listen to this part now hear the part and they went to try to pray through to receive the Holy Ghost but the Gentile dispensation had been finished and the P persecution arose what does that mean if you want the Holy Ghost you begin to pray now you're looking to pray for the Holy Ghost now Lord fill me pour out the Holy Ghost upon my life isn't that right so now you without the baptis Holy Spirit you know that is the oil if you didn't have the oil it did not go in oh Hallelujah so when they say give us some of your oil the sleeping virgin they realize they had all that time to get the oil but they didn't do it so when the briding was about to come they said give us of your oil hallelujah oh blessed be the name of the Lord and brother bam said there are five must in doing God's service correctly David was doing God a service he was doing everything he know he was doing was right but there's five must and I want you to remember this no matter how sincere A man may be there are five must isn't that right praise God it must be his time to do it isn't that right amen it must be his time and season number two it must be according to the word that was spoken it can't just be any anything God must prophesy and said this is supposed to be that's why Jesus told them if you had known Moses you was going to know me because Moses spoke about me isn't that right it must be according to the word that is spoken and this third one it must be according to the person he choose to do it by isn't that right it must by the person he choose to give it by isn't that right and it must come to His prophets and the prophet must be Vindicated so therefore we have a Vindicated Prophet that spoke Vindicated word therefore this got to come to pass so if we stay with this Vindicated Spirit spoken word how could we fail oh hallelujah we're not here to bring you some dream we here to bring you some men's idea or our own idea we here to bring you dust say The Lord Oh Glory to God isn't that right listen to brother Bram he said now watch he said when Judas fell they choose mathas to take his place and the Holy Spirit waited until all this was in order before it come are you hearing with me they had to choose one to take the Bishop Rick of Judas that fell by transgression to fulfill scripture so Maas had us to be in position even before the Holy Ghost fell Oh Glory to God here we go are you ready and I believe that all these things has a time of lingering which is the time of waiting we are talking about they that wait upon the Lord God all these have a time of lingering time of waiting it's waiting for the time for the scripture to be fulfilled till everything gets right everything in order wait [Music] him so don't get over excited did that wait upon the Lord feeding on the word of God while you're waiting praying while you're waiting preaching while you're waiting pressing while you're waiting while you're waiting testifying while you're waiting you worship him while you're waiting you're Shou him but you're waiting upon the Lord while you're waiting you're doing all that you can do because you are waiting on the [Applause] Lord many times we get impatient like a child with great anticipation jump way ahead and that hinders the work until the work get caught up we must move reverently have a purpose in our heart in that God if he desire us to do such and such but wait till he makes the opening and he talk about David wait till he hear the rustling the malberry tree you must wait to see the hand of God going before you hallelujah oh praise God so Adam bride could not wait God told Adam and Eve multiply and replenish the Earth it was an uncoming promise she was not his wife yet because she had not lived with her the bride of Christ is not his wife yet the wedding supper is to take place woman engaged to a fine young clean man they come together and what she he found she's pregnant by somebody else then her own city has betru that's what Christ found couldn't wait and that's what the matter with people today they can't wait for the real Holy Spirit here we go to take the church in position they can't wait for the real come on now I will I promise you the Holy Ghost isn't that right so the real Holy Ghost is promised and we waiting for the real holy ghost that produces real power real forgiveness real brotherly kindness not temporary kindness the honey disappear you have a a day pass for honey honey expire that kind of temporary thing that right behold I send you power Jesus give them fell power Judas was there everybody have power and they come back to you say Lord even the devil subject to us J don't Rejoice because of that I know you're feeling powerful have no character they just empowered because of a word Jesus put anointing upon them he said Rejoice because your name in heaven Rejoice because of that don't rejo because devil power because that that same power on them when Peter run you know I'm saying then Peter even draw sword you know cut off man air physical sword he feeling fitish Jesus had to take take man Jesus had to pick the man and put it back on you can imagine that Roman soldier lost his head by The Sword and Jesus pick it up and just like like stick it back he the man that made the air you say stick it back who who who use the sword fight by the sword di By The Sword just Peter don't don't even put that sword thing don't bring that sword thing inside of you your natural thing can work inside of here it take more than that because your emotion say I'll die for you but that just work up that just woke up the intellect not connecting with that at all that's just the intellectual thing at work there isn't that right but when Peter got the Holy Ghost Peter was ready he was ready to die for Christ because Paul was resident it wasn't temporary PA it was permanent power it was so much of power he could say silver and gold I don't have what God give me I could give and I release to you what I have rise up and walk Oh Oh Glory are you with me so God want to give you something authorize you with something isn't that right so they can't wait until the real Holy Spirit take the church in position they got to manufacture something isn't that right praise the name of the Lord instead of waiting for the real word of God to be made manifest to the bride that's the kind that makes the word of a true bride bringing forth children amen instead of Adam coming to her for a bride when the time appointed would be just like Christ would come to the group Christ would have come to his church he promised to do it God promised to multiply but it had was to wait until God's time but they want something big they want something amen educated and so intellectual he said now the seed that she was holding would have finally become a mother by the will of God through the spoken word spoken about Eve isn't that right but she couldn't wait isn't that right now as soon as she accepted the wisdom with the word you see and wisdom was contrary to the word amen if wisdom is with the word and proves to be with the word and the word produces Itself by the same thing then it is the word but if wisdom is against the word and not with the word but trying to find something to add to it or take from it it's of the devil and the Holy Ghost sees of the Bible here we go cannot grow in an atmosphere of wisdom so that is why the intellectual gospel can't cut it in this hour Hallelujah the only way it can grow is to separate itself from all reasonings and believe the word is that not right so he give his army his word we are not fortified behind denomination we not fortified behind groups we are fortified by the word of God so God gave this time of lingering since brother brandham left a time of lingering waiting for the cites to be cups to be full waiting for seeds to come in how I thank God for this season I have loved ones out there I sure you have loved ones out there but the season is about to come because the spirit is about to be released it's a time of judgment but the Bible in Revelation 2217 said the spirit and the bride say come how could the bride have a voice without the spirit the spirit have to come upon the bride to give the bride a voice that the bride have the authorities to come whosoever will the bride will become the fountain of Living Water oh Hallelujah she herself Mount Zion she will be the Fountain of Living Water whosoever will come and drink of the Water of Life freely because Jesus said he that believeth on me as the scripture had said out of his belly shall flow rivers of Living Water therefore the bride will be like that aesan well bringing up Fountain of spirit because the seven perfect spirits that came out of Elohim will be resident in the bride even the pillar of fire and there is my spirit flowing freely oh hallelujah it's going to flow brother it's going to flow oh my God my God my God my God my God there's going to be a fful Ministry with the full sejm in the body releasing the spirit why Peri SP these words oh Hallelujah glory to God Amen so God put us under waiting when he said wait page 304 until them seven Thunders after the voices to that group we have to wait and they going to slice and cut but we're going to wait and they that wait upon the Lord showing you their strength there's going to be a people are going to wait upon God and they're going to hear from God and the devil would move them they're going to be Anointed with power they going be Anointed with the spoken word they be anointed and they want to speak the word they going to flash just like that oh glory to God hallelujah oh Hallelujah just a few more Hallelujah but the B preacher message called the Masterpiece we know it talk about Michelangelo talk about the vision he had of Moses isn't that right he had the vision that's right isn't that right nobody else had the vision and the challenge was was to stick with division for all those years because when you're bringing that sculpture is not a overnight thing not a one we thing is a vision that's in his heart and he is hammering away he is chopping out what is not Moses is a vision of Moses anybody see him chopping they don't know what he's busting out he's hitting the rock here he's hitting the rock here and you who don't understand what he's heing out you would find just a big bunch of noise a amen they don't know what he's seeing but he is hitting here he is hitting here in his mind he is hewing out Moses and he is taking out he is taking out what is not Moses what is not acceptable to look like Moses he is taking it out he is chopping it out he is hewing it out and God is about to chop and Hue and cut and take out all what is not like him because we are going to be just like him could somebody say Amen can somebody say Amen are you with me oh Hallelujah Glory can we give the Lord a shout Glory you may be seated any genuine sculptor is inspired any genuine poet no what watch that genuine not people who say poet and and they kind write poetry any genuine singer some people can't sing they as well you read poems any genuine singer musician whatever might be all real has to come by inspiration and Michelangelo must have had the inspiration of what Moses like he caught in his mind and so forth and watch and I think of many hard years of Labor how we had to hold that same vision all the time he couldn't change a prophetic Vision he couldn't come a new vision every Monday morning have a new Moses Moses so Moses so Moses so Moses so when you when when you that Moses it has to have a vision that he could work with have a new Moses it's Monday morning and next Monday and different Moses and new revelation here a new revelation here it have to have one Revelation this is the reation here this is the revelation of perfection oh give the Lord a shout the praise this is the image that going to be he out the statue of a perfect [Applause] man oh so God going to CH out what is not Perfection go going to cut out your feelings the emotions make it people hurt people hurt and they get hurt oh God I feel it hurt and it hurt and hurt how long I feel hurt thank God go not like know go say God I feel hurt look what Adam do oh God I put him in the Garden Eden I should not do that now you make God like if da some ABC class or something so all God is is is perfect he can't uncorrect it not undo edit undo God No undo he's the Fountain of wisdom he put Adam there and he put everything set and turn his back he there's a reason he turn his back he didn't want to see but he know what going to happen and and he waiting for what to happen happen because he wanted to be a Healer but there's nobody sick he wanted to be a redeemer but there's nobody lost he wasn't be a savior nobody [Music] lost making you makinging feel to preach now you you you sit down now now God didn't tell Adam go and fall God didn't say Adam fall now waiting for the fall looking for the fall fall no God didn't do that man had Free Will free choice God pulled the woman out of the man God didn't talk to Eve God talk to Adam Adam had the word Adam was teaching Eve the word the serpent wasn't so stupid serpent he's smart guy he know he's not going to talk to Adam Adam what God say he know he get blow out the serpent know Adam will blow him out so the serpent know not to go so go where the emotions is at go where feel is that go to the woman go and talk to Eve and he went to Eve what did God say because God not talking to him he said God not talking to me what God tell you just tell me back what God tell you he God say you can eat of all the trees but the tree in the midst don't eat because the day you shall die he said come on let me show you something you sh don't tell anybody you shall not surely devil call you aside and tell you between you you and I you shall not surely die because God know you be like God you'll be wise you're feeling it and after that that was it when her husband come she gave her husband and then Adam was not deceived he loved his wife and then they fell and Satan rejoiced Satan all I'm shaking we did it we did it good job good job and God is so is so let me raise up Eel and God a whole plan and Satan don't even know the whole Redemption to unfold God to wheel around and hi Abraham Faith Isaac love Jacob grace to the Perfection go had to bring Prophet after Prophet after

only when the mighty angel from Revelation 10 come with the sweat back Wings one with the seven seal with the book open seven tunders UT the voices to bring back the authority back on the earth to bring back Redemption reclaiming rights the authority to be healed the authority to be saved the the authority to be redeemed to tell the authority to tell the devil get out the authority to go free the authority to get back to be in Eden again what an authority is [Applause] here hallelujah listen you may be seated to prove it to confirm it when brother Brandon wife was sick going for Operation God tell him he was on the field and God tell him speak and he said before the doctor's hand touches my wife the tumor will go down he had didn't have to touch her he didn't have to be there with her he just had to speak that's what Adam had the power to speak because that's what God does let there be let there be let there be and M 11:22 said if you shall say to this mountain be moved and don't doubt in your heart you can have what you [Applause] say understand the power of Faith Jesus Took Five Loaves and two fishes blessed it break it and say feed them people and as they break it it was
