the lamb of God which taketh away the sin of the world sin not since sin of the world this is he of whom I said after me come at a man which is preferred before me for he was before me and I know him not but that he should be made manifest to Israel therefore am I come baptizing with water and John be on record saying I saw the Spirit descending from heaven like a door and it bore upon him and I knew him not but he does say me to baptize with water they same said unto me upon whom thou shalt see the spirit descending and remaining on him the same is he which baptizeth with the Holy Ghost and I saw on their record that this is the son of God amen verse 35 again the next day after John stood and two of his disciples and looking upon Jesus as he walked he saith behold the lamb of God ciaossu verse 23 now when he was in Jerusalem at the Passover in the fish day many believed in his name when they saw the miracles which he did but Jesus did not commit himself to them because he knew all men

good morning alright that sounds better well it's good to be back in Trina and like but obviously many but the IAP of the army came here in 96 for the church dedication and it was a beautiful Tabernacle then and it's even more beautiful Tabernacle now and I want to think about a few yours and Mary the family of the church for the individual to be here again I think this is a 40 of the millions 40 of the minutes and for his deliverance under the talkin so we thank God to be here think about the feel for the invitation to be here and just unmarried with support the family the church the great hits and tabernacle for the tremendous feeling of welcome and hospitality that we have filled these past few days we always feel that when we come here it always feels like home I want to thank you so very much for everything on behalf of my wife and the family and pushing election leaders with you as you thank you also what our skin grapes all the you know may said we have a few have to introduce quite a little nice just from between that and thank you for coming to be with us fellowship with us on our little confirmation here and thank you very much for the church's I've been here the believers from the Church of different ones like what idealistic yesterday if the believers are here we can pursue to to Cheers other other wall so I know women instead sometimes say like I know if one person comes will preach you know but I know if only one person is sitting here I can say it will not be as exciting I can tell you that so thank you for coming thank you for taking the paints Islam God richly bless you amen and to my ministry brethren what is it thank you I always see these and everybody thinks that you're saved but friendly speaking the brothers I mean I'm looking for the Regis now and that's the preacher I want to be like when I grow up seriously and brother real happy on the look at you nine when you roll up your sleeves I somehow I always miss it but I'll keep my eyes glued open tonight to see when you roll up those sleeves and what can we say brother Peter Chandler Peter Peter I always say I tell my folks they don't come any more gentlemanly number the peerage and he's always been the same gentlemanly as porches respectful just as soon as they can come when Peter thank you for your message amen thank you for the message the New Testament in my blog and you know in in I mean this is cricket country right this run Lara's country right all right because I know in cricket I play some cricket growing up so I wasn't that good but I didn't talk all the time either seriously but even cricket you want to get an opening batsman who can you don't want to guess maybe the first ball he's bored out it demoralized the whole team so you want to get somebody who can be there block the balls and make some wrongs some for some six hit the boundary a few times and by the chili is like that on this team here but the Chandler knows had to like you know just grip the world and so it gives those of us coming behind some confidence to come like that brother Peter go go he was in the back in the hip in them to the wall come on we get most trained thing about the China now is the manners the New Testament in my blog and burp it has always been like that and then when Solomon mechina came behind and he was make me feel old Solomon approaches I'm not that old [Applause] because Salamone they're talking about you know we young folk plastic and truly true I mean to see this young man growing up brother Isaac brother Solomon but a day lays behind for question number he's in a category really he's not in my group he's in their group you know so to see like you see like your children coming behind and you know pushing the battles to the enemies come you just want to thank God but Solomon thank you for your lovely message thank you so much thank you pleasure thank you thank you and what can I say about brother Jesse Robledo brother Jesse you will not put a Jessie and we thank God for you and thank you I said is he I'm almost every year but but a JC ability oh you know young men you know like in their thirties even and they you know like theories and they will come to Nigeria you know the early nineties and leave their children behind Lee the families behind over Christmas to minister to us and we never forgot that those meetings did a lot to establish you know Austin v Nigeria brother Jesse you thank you so very much thank you for your message there was really tremendous commencements never changed to the same fire growing WJZ and yesterday morning my young men were ideally at the Lord thank you for the late for your message and what I love about him is you know he is very respectful and very low-key and he's got a rich man whose gift and you saw that yesterday morning and but the other thing is machinations to question and last night I call him Bishop but it doesn't like me saying that so I'll do what the office is the Leon of Cote d'Ivoire for the problem 90 again what can we say about last night the poll that was absolutely outstanding thank you so very much and you should know there was so much power coming through here because the first time I'm symbol 18 first time I'm Sathya wiped out brother Ian doesn't get tired three services for services 576 services at the end of it you were tired and you Pete only wants and he's gone from sick son is strong well last night there was so much power brother 18s and he'll think about the power with Aegean Thank You amen Valentine thank you thank you amen and so you should after the grimace is your you like crumb cake seriously Murray so maybe we'll give them a crumb cake I said I don't even think this is gonna be up to what you call crumb cake maybe sponge cake maybe sponge cake is which is maybe sponge cake well you take your choice you know you take a peek because after those messages that have gone forth I don't want to say they took my notes that's like a cliche you know but I don't know notes brother Raymond says same here I'm just trying to warn you up front so you don't have the messages to write the preachers are preached now brother ray is the preacher he is coming to preach tonight but so you have all the preaching so I can just talk right I can just stop I can just talk all right thank you so I can just talk to you you have the preachers I'm not I mean I say that but you know for a joke or whatever I'm not half the preachers these brothers are but somehow it's my a lot but a few wants me to speak a little words or a few words so I will try my best and I really feel sorry for me if you don't feel sorry for me I feel sorry for me amen what so I got a new title this morning God shall declare a lamp again amen okay I'm trying to keep track of my time here so I don't hold your too long so God shall declare lamb again and a little inspiration lamb for one house which of course but the fuels inspirational is the inventor message is to apply the talking and we know the even 10 messages brother branham's message that God sent to us through that great larger profit of Malachi 4 ma now we call it the message the even term message but the evening time message if you don't know what it is is to apply the talking and the main sense have tried in the series of services to like let us understand what it means to apply the talking and I'm gonna carry on the same trend this morning and brother Branham said and he's been quoted back and forth so I don't really have to quit but maybe I just read to you but the balance said the talk and when you pray the talk in September in France 1963 started talking when it came in the night and picked desperations he said the talk in the message this morning he said it was the highlight of my ministry is in terms of regular service preaching the message this money was the cap impact of my ministry the talk in the cotton pad amen let me just let me just get a call for you from Allah Branham here all right he said this morning the message this morning was to me the highlights of my entire ministry this morning see a highlight message of my entire ministry some day I'll tell you how it come about and I know that everything has worked for months and months and months up to there one message moving up to come to that place that was the cap in of time of it you see and I'm sure I hope you get what the talking meant the talk is the sign that the blood has been applied now that the price that's been asked required of God Jesus paid the price by shedding his own blood he did that then from his life came the Holy Spirit and when the blood is applied to you the Holy Spirit talking that your price is paid God has received one does the talking remember that is the talking now what is saying here is that God gives you the token which is the Holy Spirit when you have applied the blood amen very simple very simple but you know too many times so many of these things become clichés tours we just say the things without really looking at what it means and if we just hears the word and you don't really apply it the Bible says if you hear the word and you don't apply it you are like a man who looks in the mirror and straightaway he forgets what he looks like so we look into the mirror of the world and see what it tells us and we go from there and apply to our lives to let the word mix with our lives amen glory to God amen amen nice Shepherd of 28 now this man I told you been not with you I thought we had another two or three a message this morning but I just don't stand it and I thought I just carried that over for tonight but it was just such a menace I don't know what other people got it or not I hope the two every I hope they do everywhere and I hope there was some good tips on it so he can be carried out to be known that I believed all the mister I ever brought that that that that apps was ordained of God outside of a cause the regular Commission like the seven states and things that was directly the Word of God I'm talking about a message to preach I believe that one was it see the one that's needed to follow these seven seals now watch what's come after the seven seals that uniting of the people your Nana shines red light flashing you know he said you know he said after the mysteries in the book of finish and finish on all over then it's time for the sis on the backside which is the seven thunders on the back of the book because Malachi fought the great and larger profit he had the authority the seven thunders and put them before the back of the book in the world but it said when the inside with the mysteries are finished then it's time for the backside seven thunders so watch what is saying here he said now watch what's come after the seven seals the you none of the people united signs the red light flashing in the last days the son of the women getting prettier and man what they would do all these signs of the holy sprit leenock then come right back here to the capping off of all those messages in the seven seals is capped off in this one thing the token that we are all right now put a pedal prick the token you can be sure you can you're talking I don't know it's all right is the right talking for the right Johnny at the right price you cannot make sure amen the talking that way all right see just check ourselves and see if we're in the faith they make and it was a man in the Bible Jesus was called the Lamb of God when John saw him coming he said behold the lamb of God who takes away the sin of the world not the scenes of the world but the parent chorus sings the attributes of sin since a lion fornication and all that stuff those are attributes of sin but sin is unbelief so Jesus Christ the lamb came to pick sin at its roots to get sin at its origin to uproot and root at unbelief that's why Jesus came behold the lamb of God which taketh away the sin of the roll glory to God a man when you see the lamp on the scene you're no redemption is taking place when you see the lamb in the picture you're no sin has made its master I said sin has met its master when you see the lamp of God on the sin Oh Lord oh god hallelujah amen glory the holy man so when the lamb comes in the picture you know right away it's time to be talking to yourself to be having a conversation seer yourself that sin has met its master seen as marriage Waterloo and to rejoice them too tense numbers shout because you know the difference there at the door the master is come and they call it for thee oh well are you here this morning you got some sin problem because some pundits problem you can still rejoice in the master is in the house master Jesus the great lamp of God is in the house behold the lamb of God we together with the scene of the world he will get your sin and it's very roots and root it out and set you free Morry [Applause] whoa riddles caught him men amen you know in the Bible when you see a lamb right down through the Bible when you see the lamb the animal the lamb is a 10 if our Redemption every papal reader knows that but the bleeding blood lamb like we see in Revelation 5 that's the Redeemer because not just a lamp is the lamb that has shed his blood so the lamb represent Redemption amen but the real embody lamb represents the Redeemer who are shed his blood that if people can be redeemed Oh hallelujah question why would God use the lamb and an email to the pure Redemption why would God like many times use the lamb to depict his children you and I why would God use even himself as a lamb behold the lamb of God which takes away the sin of the world very simple answer simply because this animal the land got the critter created like every other generation but the animal of the lamb has the qualities that God expects to see in sons and daughters of God who are walking the road to redemption and that's why he uses the lamb as a symbol of redemption it is the lamb as the article of redemption use the lamb to represent Redemption all the time that's why I call him stuff also the Lamb of God amen Oh glory to Claudia man I know the story another story is Miss Edna smells already so crumb cake or sponge cake now animals I to fall bean you know that you know that's the amen Aya's don't have soooo and we human beings that go use the redemption i mean they are the lamb to represent our Redemption we are three full beam we have a soul and the animal doesn't have a soul now there's a disconnect lesson we're all for the Old Testament years all through the course of many years from their sojourn in Egypt all the way to when they came out and God will reap our of them immemorial down through the years when they came out of Egypt the talking and in the author's many years in the wilderness yes all around the world have the ceremony and every year they will come to the high priest and lay they bring their lamb leave their hand upon that lamb or he could or whatever and it would take it has seen away for one year and they'll come back again which we know the story what I'm going to show you something I want to show you something you know we know that the life of the lamb could not come back upon the believer the worshiper how many know that say Amen we know that so why will God do it when the life of the lamb could not come back simply because the lamb doesn't have a soul and we have a soul so ways the life the life can come from a spirit of the lamb into man soul does it is connect there but God led forces happen to let you see there's a need for Redeemer and this is just a substitute that we are gonna go to no pick+ gonna allow and accept and that alone lets you know there's a real thing to come in there's a real lamb coming down the road this is not the real am all those substituted autism and I'm not the real thing and there were only a super until the real lamb become a man the Lamb of God which is away the sin of the world amen I want to follow up on the dealing number the Peter so I'm all school but i feels try to get me to a new school all these years and so i want to can you give me the first because up okay all right all right i do this one once before in about three years ago in some information nigeria it feels good to or I take a look at this take a look at this an animal has a body and a spirit all animals have their own nature - just like you have your nature a lion is the king of the jungle it will grow back oh and every other animal will keep quiet and don't go back you know it could will do whatever they have the different nature's animals everybody and their spirit that's where the nature is controlled from because they have no soul but look at man that's you and I we have three compartments a body I mean a soul a spirit anybody for us our our nature is controlled from the soul and that's what the branch that the soul is the nature of the Spirit in other words the soul gives them give a spirit its nature so whatever nature you sure you have it's hiding somewhere in your soul that's the origin that's the control center that gives you the attitude thing character whatever it is that you have is right in the soul is not the things that I Amanda pollute man is the things that go from inside man to the outside a pollutant can you say a man nor in a god so here's the problem this animal here even though it seemed less but it can transfer its fear into men's so we're men's nature's control from so all the to do was lay hand on your sacrifice identify your sacrifice and course is the innocent life of that lamb and forgive you for one whole year but because the lamb didn't have the power to transfer its own power to not seem to them they just go and I cannot show you right a few days after they were back doing the same things again back doing the same things again and just hoping that next year we'll go again and put a handle it was almost like a license to the scene there was no real labor and effort to like steal the tool that's why Israel so many times so many times Israel pursuing title Israel sinned Israel ditched off when Coe will punish them right after they'll go back again because the blood of bulls and goats did not have power to take over to take helsing and so their men perpetually sinners can you say man thus I was in the Old Testament years and anybody and everybody knew this cannot be the prophet pattern no it can be this was just a substitute amen to just show they had a clear conscience they don't want to do wrong and go in Chris forgive them that's how it was amen on to the Lamb of God Jesus Christ came but why Israel Wow will they not be able to do even though they know what is the right thing to do why don't they do the right thing what I want you and I to the right and even though we know they were thing to do that's why the talking come class while the talking come behold the lamb of God who takes away the scene of the wall it comes to you today comes to you tomorrow come see wherever you are to take care of the same problem I'm not talking about being the message I'm talking about the same problem Carroll because Israel knew what was the right to do but they could not do it so it's not it is not knowing the right thing to do it is not knowing the message is the power to leave about the scene that's what we are talking about that's what the talking is about the supraorbital preach Redemption by blood and by power oh you know why Israel could not even though the new could not leave above the wrong and they say you know why the emotions the emotions università for image crumb cake thank you I know you're trying to make me feel good you are very kind of very lovely all right just bear with me my you know but but I want to show you why Israel the new water I need to do and they still won't do the right thing you know when the man fell in the Garden of Eden the Bible said ah nothing but regret over the deal if somebody mention it but Adam knew what was right Adam wasn't deceived Adam noon and the same way many times we were not deceived when you're doing wrong you know that can I get a witness can I get a witness Adam wasn't received Eve was beguiled the see but Adam was not deceived so what happened emotions emotions the next slide please next picture all right forgive me I did a few years of medical school so you gotta forgive me I'm an ex doctor don't tell me I have a headache watch it I have a headache drink some what a lot of water or something I mean forget it now forgetting all of America has to cool stuff I forgot me I wasn't in Goodson in school anyway so - leave it for so many years together forgotten - forgive this now Israel like you and I human beings don't make easier they're very rebellious just like you and I are very rebellious and that's what the token each one knew was what to do and even do the right thing when Adam sinned Genesis 3 oh I didn't get my conduct creatures but when Adam sinned and either sin and the fair and God drove them out of the garden God said God said now that the man has become like one of us knowing good and evil let's drag him out so he won't take his him and totally of life and live forever and then the Bible says for eternal roaring do testament to his that nor to do good and to I did not dream in the scene can somebody give me an amen no you didn't hear me you did not hear me no he did not hear me God sent Adam out because he has become like one of us they are pleased to be like God is to know good and evil like God looks upon the earth it is the scene it is the wrong is this the fitness but doesn't kill who is he still does good all the time but landed the money come like one of us and he knows the man doesn't have the capacity to do good all the time like that and just straight his head in his bullet instead to the tree of life and live forever don't drop him out these were only shown improve the Adams children turn by the same atomic nature that the fall brought in knowing good and evil but no ability no power no no no no no where we fell to shun the wrong and to the right not just Israel to use in the same spot today amen already talking about the talking but delay one my lot about husband wife and you know your family try to get I mean I'm gonna see along there but I want to focus on you on you to make sure that the talking really is significant your life our emotions nobody teaches us how to manage them how to take care of them how to recognize them how to overcome them how to dominate them nobody did you sense that we're gonna screw Berlin all the MBAs do all the things I'm gonna go into the workforce going to life nobody teaches how to a hand let me turn on in German in school and many times on at home either but the Bible says Bible says Paul Romans seven that lovely bit about Paul Roman seven where was he was he saying it or not still know that I'll answer that question for you Paul said what I would I would not when could is present with me when I wanted to good evil is very present what's wrong with me who shall deliver me from the body of this death who shall deliver me Paul cried out the great Apostle Paul but we make like Norma me I'm overcoming I'm overcoming I'm overcoming lie many times sly norther when overcoming what by the bantha is the little silly fun tone those are things of eternal destination Booya wait Ryan bean and I see the head let you know all the senses of the body see smell taste hear feel or touch whether you recognize it or not when you see or feel or hear what happens they're sent into your body by what they call electrical impulses going to your body your body don't your body that's why you can't see my electric show because your body's like an electric city station so you can receive a shot because it get connected and you get shocked so when you see all your feelings what you see is a feeling when we talks filaments everything's just the touch no it's beyond the torch what you see what you smell if you smell good food it's a feeling if it tastes that sponge cake mMmmm it's the feeling that's right if you have a sound like brand lares causing you know boundary like a six or something I had a push out is a feeling and every feeling what happens a pass through your body and go is going to the brain is headed for your frontal lobe right behind your forehead that's where all of the signals are interpreted I'm sorry Lou science labs right you know senseless but he's okay all right why do you do this to me so because you took it away like the Megan see the delay take it away Anya took their way so but delicious right for these signs one zero one class this morning so when the things they enter this is your spinal cord they call ranchers man code and enter through the base of your brain they're headed for the frontal lobe where you can think and this feeling is like smell well this flame is like a torch this feeling like a dish this is what I'm hearing are you with me all that is can trust in the period here in the frontal lobe but here's the problem I read this Jesus even that any much will generate by man because he knew all men and he knew also what was a man like this he made us equally knows he knows what we're made of he knows how we are wired consumerism [Applause] [Music] so all these sensations and feelings I had a frontal lobe to interpret them he has the problem they have to pass through what they call the limbic system where your feelings take place where emotionless ticklish that were really should issue emotions why emotions take place so splittsboro Lawrence hey and that sound comes to him as a feeling and it goes through his spinal cord base of his brain and before I guess the frontal lobe like that over the always talking to me for my own good it goes with emotions look at how I shouted at me Cheryl I mean I feel bad and you took back what she shot at me like that weight added to you La Perla telecine yesterday husband gets home wife gets home watch this honey great well the process in it by you it comes here enters here emotions rather and so what yes I had it so so later later this office business splits the confidence in my field my wife is just trying to compliment me too we know how we are we do the action first stupid irresponsible and then we think later that's who we know that's who you are me I'm not like that that is who you are that's how you are wired can you say Amen I'm almost done seriously I'm almost done so we are wired to react before we think our emotions just reacted before we think I know what that's how animals are because the animal only has the brain don't have a soul I must have a brain and their thinking center is very primitive but animals are based on especially the most well two human beings the chimpanzees and all that they are like people who study mama I mean primal behavior knows our brains that fashion the same way this primitive brain here is all about your emotions your feelings and unfortunately for us we are wired to respond by emotion before we even think and that's where is the problem that is the problem it's your problem my problem is a human problem it is not just your watch problem is your problem to you he's not your husband swap it's your problems you and when it gets this put here you don't care who else has the problem you see Lord I have a problem I want my problem solved remain so we have come to the great convention applying the talking that's the event a message and we know all these things but that's here that's here the frontal lobe so won't we leave here tomorrow morning and we go home we think automatically we're going to stop doing the things no no I'm not going to pour cold water on your excitement just trying to tell you the truth because the same session would happen exactly it's just a hotel her husband and that emotions care of him while he's reacting he's thinking right a will at the action between this but he just can't stop himself so that's our problem there that's the problem right there before the ticket of just take a look at it for image crumb cake class right just be ready for a few minutes and just think about you all the things you've read in this meeting here the boy speaking to you like that son daughter you're gonna make you got to make amends here you gonna change here this here he's gonna stand in the way amen Thank You brothers so God knew all of this can do that and that's why you know men will hardly ever be able to live by the commandments of God on their own because of the way they are structured because of the way they are made and that's why he will let them come every year I wouldn't tell them why did you listen again why didn't I listen again because you know that's just how they are structured is waiting for the time when the Lamb of God who's gonna take away the sin is gonna solve for you this problem the Lamb of God will solve for you this problem can you say Amen and he has already solved our problem ma amen so what he got do what he got do what he got you God in the beginning when he made Adam and Eve he knew right away that this year he's gonna make them have a pram with even keeping the word so what he did they had a control center outside of the brain a control center which is an S soul like the king when he speaks these ones will ran up when he speaks emotions Lana when he speaks feelings manner when he speaks reason lines up so God you made money 3 for Ben let me have this frosted picture back again I'm in the soul of man he put the control center you know was this the person that I put there we each know the story already God before the foundation of the world and all of that I don't want to go over that because you know that but God you put your seed which is the person of himself which is your connection with God they put that seed in the soul and let's see I don't wish that all the time but a sheet is what will bring from the miracle hallelujah is not a sin like your mango seed is a sin of God and everything is in that seed and that seed will bring for his own kind and it's got seed it will people of God's kind and whatever you are supposed to be is already in that seed so what happens what happens the feelings come into your body dry motions we want to react the control center in the soul tells it no don't do that these are split-second things but that's exactly what happens that's what a Christians behavior is different that's why Christian dozens you can't even explain yourself because the sinner power remains in you the sinner God the sinner God contains every bad behavior until every part habits let me redo some things let me do some things in here memory some things here but the promise said intellectually we're hearing the message and intellectually we have heard all these things here not because we're the lecturers no it simply means by our brains we understand these things but don't let the devil fool you but because you are understand actually is automatic you will do them because your emotions are gonna stand in the way [Applause] Oh glory let me read you this go for mother banner I'm almost done when I say I'm almost in that means that I've got about one foot of the way thank you for your kind of understanding all right so that's right that's two three quarters I have from the deli once after what is the message of the hour it's not message message of the minutes measure the hour so I should do at least an hour but Peter I gotta come to your school I can two of us in 45 minutes with two minutes I say man is like gurantee playing games all right great run oh ho chi long are you following me all right let me just read this good here intellectually we have fought we're hearing the message but the Branum said here Amazing Grace this is from God's brave little warship polypropylene is our washing he said Amazing Grace how sweet the sound see just know we're ever explain what it is just take my word if you believe me he was talking about you know put me on the cotton of time be sure to make sure upon every breach of the wall behind you I believe the church is begin to hear the message and begin to understand it people say we don't have to understand it's true in other words you don't have to do intellectual honest time to do it that's right but the Holy Spirit gives you some little understanding that will help you along the way but truly we don't have to understand like you explained by your intellect and all that but it's not a chore to be to understand the message but friends listen but you're on your intellectually understanding we've got to lay in the prints of a song we've gotta be ripened our faith even after you read all these glorious things this weekend our faith isn't a rapper yet intellectually we're here in the message God has given us and seen the science that is showed us I'm proving it by the pebble is there but all how the chat needs to lay in the presence and it's presently ten days of you know and gets within the spirit to come beat down sometimes in speaking the message you get hash you'll get hash and that limbic system emotions and say like what are they talking to me like that doesn't say that you know it's my good it's the message it's the talk in sometimes with the message you can hash you have to break in like that because you've got to clinch and nail to make it home but well when the chat once gets it the locker is called out and separated then in the presence of God I know it means something like oh people was there when it takes its rapture so let's have the talking deal with this problem for all put emotions in its place so that would be you know after what we know so that we will not be found sinful because it he that knows what to do and to a did not is not iniquity the Browse it to him it is seen that's why other was driven are they got a villain and we are not going to go back to Eden doing the same thing learn what's right and not to in it expect to go back to even that's why the talkin share the Lamb of God that takes away all the scene of the world Oh hallelujah it will take your every problem he will deliver every package or it'll caught many men all right now I emotions and sickness is a big issue because we rise and fall on the ability to control our emotions what was in first Romans seven the motions of sin is the emotions of sin most every sin that you and I to our emotions make us do it so they can learn to master and control our emotions we will live much better than many of us are living even though we know the message we know what better plan I'm set to do we know love your brother love your sister we know all of these things don't make more young people know go to school and be a Christian Brothers know go on the job and be a Christian there's a token now the kokino come to pat you on the back the talking calls my house cleaning time a man took in the stable to clean this table and make sure you are right with God Oh hallelujah glory the problem is many of us don't even know that we are controlled by these emotions we explain them away we justify them sure the reason why we act before we think and because of our ego because of our pride even when we have caught ourselves that what we did or said or or acted is wrong we will not say I am sorry we will say well yeah I took that because of the way you talk to meet you so well you know so what about that [Applause] even when you know this practical Christian living that's what the token represents glory to God amen oh man let me let me show you something here when we talk about emotions many of us can't even explain what it is I know if you study those things that you can check them off those of you who say those things there are five basic emotions that we have and every lot emotion we have options of these emotions happiness anger sadness fear and shame happiness sadness fear anger shame nor through your Bible you will see you know this in different place in the Bible but these are the five major categories but every other emotion is under their anger communicable you can be so so frustrated as something that's some form of anger fear you can be scared stiff or you can just be like little afraid the different levels of the emotions and we think I'm no longer a slave to fear many of us ago February bonded to so many other things some of us from the church hey brother Guido's rich sauce just Manohar but just angry why we don't know why you took your cylinder just what is wrong with me why did I react to that brother like that you see I don't know then go meet him and say I'm sorry no let me give you a few a few things here happiness there's so many unions you can check them out happiness you can put there elation excitement your 3-yard amen you're fired up you know father when you're sad you're fired or you were you're cheerful you were glad you are contented you're pleased and so many other shades of emotions can come under happiness and sadness you can feel hurt you can feel sorrowful you can feel miserable you can feel heartbroken like Jesus was not broken on the cross you can feel let down you can feel unhappy you can feel disgusted you can feel on you can feel upset now be mad let sadness and so many other emotions that go with sadness and anger you can be enraged some are angry they're spitting fire some are angry you don't even see it they are very good at controlling the emotions they're angry they are boring on the inside where they're just cool this cool anger you can be annoyed irritated touchy Josep just please what did i do please just torchy just duty what is it I just angry he's an anger emotion you know you shouldn't do it but the limbic system your emotions are holding you captive he is the big one fear I am no longer a slave to fear many of us I'm buying to fear that these guys are so many things and we just don't know it fear can come as fearful it can be petrified you can be apprehensive just the apprehension apprehension like I don't know some see in the car every everything there is that's very nice fear and fear hath torment just fear the emotions just feel insecure just feel insecure just insecurity just don't know like that they don't love me in this church they don't want me the structure the way the process put to me the way that they can talk to me they don't love industry that insecurity is affair and those things were awesome bondage never that was a funfair worried she's from a fear team eat fear and shame that's the last category where Isaac spoke to us and spooky elastin I believe or two Sundays ago my people shall never be ashamed Shem you feel shame when you feel disgraced you feel disgraced before people shame when you even admonished for something that's your own people just react with shame because the water is coming in and the let me see that look at that disgracing you that is Grace in you how dare he talk to you like that how dare he because I'm in this church here on that church or whatever you feel discouraged you feel guilty when you are secretive like brother Isaac said when you don't things annual secretive it's change that makes you hide the things I should bring out in the open so you can get help and deliverance ship makes you had it under the table and the devil loves that shame and regret that's a big one shin regret you oh if only if only if only just live your life you look back 10 20 30 years just regrets like that Jim each of these emotions the limbic system or some day even when you know that's what was bomb said when the humanistic realm just walking by the deepest of your mind you can make real progress as a Christian you were like any other man as man you are like an animal because animals only listen from this year they live from this year that's that's what you were like Amen glory to God amen and slip by emotions you can see right away emotions can be a very very destructive force are you can see in the fall in the for what happened sitting him to Eve have God said so sure what I said you shall not she's quoting from her frontal lobe what she need to be the right thing and she was right and the devil knew the Bible said but the venom said the serpent man he understood the principles of life he understood the principles of life he knew a prince that close to that's why you just a friend it was on his feet like a chimpanzee they're driven by the emotions and most our brains are close to that so what did he do to get her to drop what she knew God said what'd he do he said you shall not surely die you said no I shall die so he took it to her eyes and when she saw that the fruit the tree was Pooja and to make one wise have feelings she saw it she smelt it it put his help on her it felt good he felt it felt good so she began to sitting here this was good she was good disconnecting her from what she knew to be what God said disconnecting her disconnecting her and the Bible said when she tasted so it was a fruit to make one wise she took of it clean her mouth and give to a husband with her and that's how Cain and Abel came forth our parents who came straight from God could not beat this pathway and the devil knew that make them slaves to their emotions make them round up to the emotions and with any time so intellectually we had a message it's not enough there is not enough just too many things you and I know is right to do and yet we will not do it because of our emotions can somebody say Oh hallelujah God amen amen amen Oh glory all right I'm skipping all this here amen so what are we here in this convention for we're here in this convention to meet the Lamb of God who takes away the sin of the world in other words he gets seen at it's very roots no sins those that just those that just a small characteristics of sin to get at his various and I'm telling you the very roots of it but Jesus knew all men here know what sin man they knows why they are acting the way they're acting where they are and where they are reacting where you understand these things you don't understand why your wife can't get angry when there's no need for anger why your husband can be mad I mean when there's no need for it you know what's going on you know why your husband has been mean nasty the way he's or your son is just crazy the ways you understand those things because you understand these things here can you say Amen let me review in France at you from Romans 7 Paul said verse 4 wherefore my brethren you also have become dead to the law by the body of Christ there should be married to another even to him who is raised from the dead that we should bring forth fruit unto God for when we were in the flesh humanistic the motions of scenes which were by the law did walk in our members to bring forth fruit unto death but now we are delivered from the law that being dead where we were held that we should serve in newness of spirit along the ordinance of the letter let me tell you here we know those we know that Peter Peter the great Apostle Peter who would mention that Alesana many now are the christ the son of living and i just given the keys you should have the keys of the kingdom peter knew you know he had a revelation so is not it not to have a revelation a revelation is not enough because with cheapen I have a revelation and they will leave anyhow the talking is coming and calling me halt to all of them Peter had a revelation but what did you Jesus want him Jordan a mystery transmitter he said not me me and when the battle came to it Peter denied the Lord three times he cursed he denied Christ you talk about Christ in the third person I don't know that man when Peter came face-to-face with death these emotions fear gripped him and what he knew he had been warned what in you he pushed aside said no no I'm not to die yet that man I don't know him and yet we have the keys you have the keys to the kingdom so don't tell me I have a revelation it is not enough in me something more than that can you say Amen Laurie no Gordy me alright what to care of this in Adam before the fall God talking to Adam soul God spirit from heaven and that's why you and I need the baptism of the Holy Ghost with other part of the Holy Ghost you don't stand a chance you don't stand a fighting chance like for the Pan Am said you don't stand a chance they might already know little God amen amen amen amen Oh glory well thank God this ought to make you afraid our faith is based upon his finished work because you know the reason why God he told Israel take a lamb for one house I know the reason why God he took a lamb for his own house way before the foundation of the wall he took a lamb to settle this situation he took a lamb for his house hallelujah Oh glory may be seated Oh hallelujah God took a lamb for his house for the furnishing of the world God been taught he knew what was gonna be he knew they would who would receive him who would not receive him you know what's gonna happen so

lamb heat it in the house and then take its blood and put on the outside the real activity was going on on the inside of the house and sharing what well the real activity was the outside was just for

created angels and angels where is representing us I represented everybody that was going to be on the face of this out here except this happened CJ and that's the other half of the book of life everybody's there except the serpent seed under Lucifer was perfect until sin was fine his heart so the Lamb of God knows where the scene is at it's in the heart it's in the heart that's where you deal with it and when Lucifer Rosa he came against the world came against Michael which is the spirit the Holy Spirit Gordon is angelic form despite him against him Michael fought back a listen for fault Michael fought back Michael didn't stop the fight most of us that the fight you because when I worship the fact was a worship when Lucifer could not overcome his place was not found any more in heaven and he was kicked out so don't be surprised apologies who was prettier than that about uh Pharaoh been stubborn as Lucifer spirit but it was spirit just resist the things of God we see the trailer of the for so long and eventually spur was kicked out of heaven and became a wand'rin star get on through the earth and after the wine heaven the book of life was put together the names that was splashing blood before the beginning and all the names are observed by angel spirits were put together the Tanner section and the regular section book of love was expressed the war in heaven but

of life for pants I told you on the back of his mind his passion even blood wrote your name in the tenor section which is Lamb's Book of Life when the regular section angels represented our spirits we every one of them and the one who see became there were those who fail and this group here involved the foolish virgins involve the bottom line believers and foolish virgins very coasters and all those people who were not given the question coming to the message of the hour in the age have you ever wondered why they receive the Word of God while they can respond to the gospel because there's a space in there like Pilate Lee I think you say about science founded in the heart there's a space the soul of man and in the so there's a space to receive the Word of God that's where your seat is at and the series the Word of God but if they don't have a seat like they are not in the bride in the age they have that space there they can receive the Word of God but as it doesn't remain thus it doesn't remain in other words they can go all the way with a fool God they can receive a portion hey partially a person a person there that's not the Citadel remaining remaining to remain all the way to the very end hallelujah for you the see decorum means in you Oh hallelujah hallelujah and because the City of God is in you today that's why you'll know you will overcome every temple because you

Minjae when he drove Adam out I've said this so many times but let me go sister a picture number three and I'm don't glory laughing this is beautiful I wish like men about to eat in the Bible said when he drove Adam out of you didn't I say declared lamb there you drove out I'm out if you see the story of your Redemption when he drove Adam out the Bible said he planted a garden eastward in Eden so this walkin is on the eastern part of Eden right I'm waiting to Adam out so that Adam will not touch the tree of life again what he did he put kilims on the eastern part of Eden the the Gann was interest part of Eden the to develop was in the middle of the garden on the eastern part of Eden and the eastern part is like the backside I damaged it all the time this Bible here you know you know he's a book of symbols the book of life that she of life and if it have the Bible this way this part here is it northern that this Puryear is a sound path this front part here is the Western map this back part here is the instant match so this Caribbeans were on the eastern pat on the back pad or The Tree of Life on the eastern part of Eden those things mean something and I put Cara babies there with a flaming sword to make sure they drove Adam out and make sure Adam will not come back to that tree of life and I McDermott eyes you can see Adam walking away and God looking at his son walking away he had no uncle to go to no auntie to go to no friend he was the only man on the face of the earth and his wife have you ever thought of that was they launched some war for Adam but he had sinned and sin has its consequences young people see in the house consequences and God drove him out too many times we want a lot more than God loves let me leave that alone so God Adam was gonna solve those Carrigan's the flaming sword I knew he couldn't strike for his hand to the Tree of Life that's the place that's the place where that book because it shared life was it was the life the Adam has open access to the book of redemption the bucola was open to him he had open access and this is where the book became closed and went back to the hands of original owner right here right here the flaming sword throw them out and seal the book on his back pad by the Cubans kerubim out you went back out Cara beams if you go through the Bible nothing about this book of symbols go through the Babel one of these cannibals cherubims eastward you know the flaming sword and the lamb was there and the book went back to the hands of original owner God the Lamb of God himself and you'll see down through the Bible this book got opened temporarily many times Elijah quite a Lord I'm the only one God temporarily open the books Elijah and he saw there were seven thousand names under the seal of life who are
