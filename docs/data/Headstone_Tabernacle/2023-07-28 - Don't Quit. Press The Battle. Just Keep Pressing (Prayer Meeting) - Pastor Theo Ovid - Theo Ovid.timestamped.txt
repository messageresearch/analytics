[12:43] and Galatians chapter 6. verse 9
[12:49] and I'll read another one after that but
[12:51] let's read Colossians chapter 4 verse
[12:53] two it says continue in prayer
[12:56] and watch
[12:57] in the scene with Thanksgiving
[13:00] and the Amplified it says be earnest
[13:03] an unwarried and steadfast in your
[13:06] prayer life
[13:07] being bought alert
[13:09] I'm intent in your praying with
[13:12] Thanksgiving
[13:14] Collision six nine
[13:16] and let us not be wary in well-doing
[13:19] for in due season we shall reap
[13:22] if we faint not
[13:24] let me read it again let us not be wary
[13:26] in well-doing
[13:29] for in due season we shall reap if we
[13:31] faint not and the Amplified it reads let
[13:35] us not lose heart
[13:36] and grow weary
[13:38] and faint in acting nobly and doing
[13:42] right
[13:43] for in due time and at the appointed
[13:46] season we shall reap if
[13:49] we do not loosen
[13:51] and relax our courage
[13:53] and faith
[13:55] and our Alaska different now will be
[13:57] Psalms 37
[13:58] within verse 23
[14:01] the 24 Psalms 37.
[14:04] other reason this wise the steps of a
[14:07] good man
[14:09] are ordered by the Lord
[14:12] and he delighted in his way
[14:15] though he fall
[14:17] he shall not be utterly cast down
[14:21] for the Lord
[14:23] upholded him
[14:24] with his hand may God bless his word
[14:27] we'll follow title for this little
[14:28] exhortation tonight
[14:30] it's don't quit
[14:32] press the button
[14:34] and if you have the third Wednesday
[14:36] night service you should
[14:38] it's an important service Nester in time
[14:41] again but again and we just think it's
[14:44] just but I'll give you and Jesse a few
[14:45] words no listen to what the spirit is
[14:48] speaking look into what the word that
[14:50] God is speaking to us
[14:52] and God will use different Brothers
[14:54] different gifts different talents and
[14:56] Ministries to get his will across to us
[14:59] so this is the title don't quit
[15:01] press the button just keep pressing
[15:06] and sometimes we get despondent
[15:08] sometimes we feel to quit
[15:10] and to quit is to give up and let go
[15:13] to resign
[15:14] to depart the given to drop out the
[15:18] criticism stop doing
[15:20] something
[15:21] stop stop praying stop worshiping stop
[15:24] reading your Bible
[15:26] stop having Fellowship
[15:28] the acquitted
[15:30] I want to encourage you tonight
[15:32] don't quit
[15:34] now for the Brian give a story here and
[15:36] rejected King and I thought that it
[15:37] would be good to bring this to you
[15:40] he said I woke up I thought I'm Dreaming
[15:42] so much I wonder why
[15:43] I looked down and told his wife laying
[15:46] by me
[15:47] I raised up on my pillow and many of you
[15:49] people have done with my head upon the
[15:51] headboard of the bed and put my hands
[15:53] behind me
[15:54] I was laying there like this and said
[15:55] wow we just wonder what it will be the
[16:00] other side
[16:01] I'm already 50. I haven't done nothing
[16:04] yet
[16:05] if I can only do something to help the
[16:06] Lord if I know I won't be mortal half of
[16:09] my time is gone at least more than half
[16:11] live to be as old as my people still
[16:14] half of my time is gone I looked around
[16:16] I was laying there fixing together
[16:18] it was about seven o'clock
[16:20] I said I believe I go on to church this
[16:22] morning
[16:23] if I'm hoarse I'd like to hear but I'll
[16:25] never preach
[16:27] so I said are you awake honey
[16:29] and she was sleeping very soundly
[16:31] now I don't want you to miss this it has
[16:34] changed me
[16:36] I can't be the same brother Brandon that
[16:40] I was
[16:41] I looked and I heard something kept
[16:44] saying you're just starting
[16:47] press the button
[16:48] just keep pressing
[16:50] I shook my head and then I thought
[16:52] I probably was just thinking like this
[16:54] you know a person can get some
[16:56] imagination and I said I just probably
[16:59] imagined that it said press the button
[17:02] keep going keep going
[17:04] and I said maybe I said it so I put my
[17:06] lips between my teeth put my hand over
[17:09] my mouth
[17:10] and here it come again
[17:12] just keep pressing if you only knew what
[17:15] was at the end of the road
[17:16] I heard something say would you like to
[17:19] see just beyond the curtain
[17:21] I said it would help me so much
[17:24] and I looked and in just a moment one
[17:27] bread I come into a little place that
[17:30] and I look back and there I was laying
[17:33] on the bed
[17:34] this is a strange thing
[17:37] now I would not want you to repeat this
[17:39] this is before my church my sheep that
[17:41] I'm pastoring whether I wasn't like this
[17:43] body or not whether it was a translation
[17:45] I was like in a vision
[17:48] and I could look there
[17:50] and then I hit this little place I seen
[17:53] so many people come running screaming oh
[17:56] oh precious brother and I looked and a
[17:58] young woman maybe in the early 20s 18 to
[18:01] 20 they were throwing their arms around
[18:02] me and screaming our precious brother
[18:05] But Here Come a young man in the
[18:07] Brilliance of Young Manhood the eyes
[18:09] glistening look like stars in a dark
[18:12] night their teachers Fighters Pro they
[18:14] were screaming and grabbing me and
[18:16] screaming oh precious brother and I
[18:18] stood and I looked and I was young
[18:20] I stopped
[18:22] and I looked
[18:24] and I was young
[18:25] I look back at my old body laying there
[18:28] with my hands behind my head I said I
[18:31] don't understand this and this young
[18:33] woman threw in the arms around me no I
[18:36] do realize this is a mixed audience and
[18:38] I see this with the sweetness with the
[18:40] numbness of the spirit men kind of put
[18:43] your arm around woman without a human
[18:44] sensation
[18:45] but it wasn't deal there was no
[18:48] yesterday no tomorrow they didn't get
[18:50] tired I've never seen such pretty woman
[18:53] in all my life they had their hair way
[18:56] down to the waistline long skirts to
[18:58] their feet
[18:59] and they were just hugging me it was not
[19:02] hug like even my own sister sitting here
[19:04] without me they were not kissing me I
[19:06] wasn't kissing them it was something I
[19:09] have not got the vocabulary I haven't
[19:12] got the words to say perfection wouldn't
[19:14] touch it superb would even touch it
[19:16] nowhere it was something you have to
[19:18] beat here
[19:19] I look this way and that way and they
[19:23] were coming by the thousands I said I
[19:24] don't understand this and here come hope
[19:27] that was my first wife she run and never
[19:29] said my husband she said my precious
[19:32] brother
[19:33] and when she hugged me there was another
[19:35] woman standing there that hugged me and
[19:37] then who hugged this woman and I thought
[19:40] this has to be something different
[19:43] I taught
[19:45] oh would I ever want to go back to that
[19:47] old carcass again I look around dear and
[19:51] I thought what is this
[19:52] and I look real good and I said I can't
[19:56] understand this but hope seemed to be
[19:58] like a guest of honor she was not
[20:00] different but just like a guest of honor
[20:03] and I heard a voice that spoke to me
[20:05] that was in the room and said this is
[20:09] what you preached was the Holy Ghost
[20:12] this is perfect love
[20:15] and nothing can enter here without it
[20:19] I am more determined than ever in my
[20:21] life
[20:22] that it takes perfect love to enter
[20:24] there
[20:25] was no jealousy
[20:27] there was no tiredness there was no
[20:29] death
[20:30] sickness could never India mortality
[20:34] could never make you old they could not
[20:36] cry it was just one joy for my precious
[20:40] brother
[20:41] and they took me up
[20:43] and set me on a big high place and I
[20:46] thought
[20:46] I'm not dreaming I'm looking at my body
[20:49] laying there on the bed
[20:51] and they set me up here and I said oh I
[20:54] shouldn't be set here
[20:55] and here come women and men from both
[20:58] sides just in the bloom of Youth
[21:00] screaming and one woman was standing
[21:03] there she screamed oh my precious
[21:04] brother we are so happy to see you here
[21:08] I said I don't understand this
[21:11] and then that voice
[21:13] that was speaking from above me said you
[21:16] know it is written in the Bible that the
[21:19] prophets were guarded with their people
[21:21] I said yes I remember that in the
[21:24] scripture said why this is when you will
[21:26] gather your people
[21:28] I said then they are real I can feel
[21:31] them oh yes I said there are millions
[21:34] but there's not that many Brahms and the
[21:36] voice said they are not Brahms they are
[21:40] converts they are the ones you have led
[21:43] to the Lord and said some of them women
[21:45] dear that you think are so beautiful
[21:47] were better than 90 years old when you
[21:51] led them to the Lord no wonder they are
[21:54] screaming or precious brother
[21:56] on the screen all at once if you hadn't
[21:59] have went
[22:00] we wouldn't have been here
[22:03] I looked around and I thought well I
[22:05] don't get it I said oh where is Jesus I
[22:07] want to seem so bad
[22:09] they said no he's just a little higher
[22:12] right up that way
[22:13] someday he will come to you you see you
[22:17] were sent for a leader and God will come
[22:20] and when he does he will judge you
[22:22] according to what you taught them first
[22:25] whether they go in or not
[22:27] and we will go in
[22:30] according to your teacher I said oh I'm
[22:33] so glad that Paul does he have to stand
[22:35] like this your speech up this time like
[22:37] this and say yes
[22:38] I said and I preach every word I did
[22:40] preach I've never did it from it one
[22:42] side to the other where they baptized
[22:44] the name of the Jesus Christ I did too
[22:46] but they taught the baptism of the Holy
[22:48] Ghost I did too whatever they thought I
[22:50] did too and then people scream and said
[22:52] we know that we know we are going with
[22:55] you someday back to Earth
[22:58] said Jesus Will Come and you'll be
[23:00] judged according to the word that you
[23:02] preached us
[23:03] and then if you are accepted at that
[23:06] time which you will be said you will
[23:09] present us to him
[23:11] as your trophies
[23:13] of your ministry
[23:15] said you will guide us to him and all
[23:17] together we'll go back to Italy forever
[23:20] I said do you do I have to return back
[23:22] now yes
[23:24] well keep pressing on
[23:26] oh my keep
[23:28] pressing on things
[23:31] I never met another message my angels
[23:33] shall go before thee he said we who are
[23:36] in contact with the spiritual realm of
[23:37] God
[23:38] you said I was prayed for and it didn't
[23:40] get me healed I guess there's nothing to
[23:42] it what a poor crew beat you make for
[23:45] God see God warned somebody who will not
[23:49] give up
[23:50] a winner never quits and a quitter never
[23:54] wins
[23:55] if you've got to stay and call it call
[23:58] things right before Satan tell him it's
[24:00] this way God said alone the Lord has
[24:02] said it so and it is written it is
[24:04] written no matter what is this it is
[24:06] written
[24:07] you said brother never got to touch me
[24:09] it is written but Abraham never got done
[24:12] no healing God done your healing it's
[24:14] already did it it's written whatever I
[24:16] ask and believe God I shall receive it
[24:19] it is mine my personal property and
[24:22] since we have to begin to claim things
[24:24] as our personal property don't
[24:26] generalize it healing is mine uh
[24:29] Deliverance is mine Joy is mine Victor
[24:31] is mine you're claiming it as your puss
[24:33] not profit
[24:34] for the brown
[24:37] now go and let's do some conference now
[24:40] God lets it gets that way
[24:42] he brought Israel right into a trap
[24:45] mountains and deserts on both sides
[24:48] federal army pursuant potions of
[24:50] Chariots and Spears and a bunch of
[24:52] humbly report slaves not armed with
[24:54] nothing come down to the dead Red Sea to
[24:57] his bank here was the dust of the
[25:00] Chariots coming and here was a mountain
[25:02] on either side no weed looked like God
[25:04] was a bad military man let his people
[25:07] with no retreat
[25:08] then the prophet slipping here this year
[25:10] now
[25:11] sometimes he does that
[25:14] he let the doctor walk away and say they
[25:16] ain't going to live you're going to die
[25:18] that cancer are going to kill you you
[25:21] will never get out of that chair he
[25:23] seemed like he leaves you with no
[25:25] retreat but he is your retreat climb
[25:28] back into his arms Rod he is my refuge
[25:32] he's my multi-tower
[25:34] the name of the Lord is a magic Tower
[25:36] the righteous ruins and are thief the
[25:39] towers of Refuge he's our refuge no
[25:41] other Refuge but him I don't want to
[25:43] know any other Refugee he's my refuge
[25:45] he's my rock in the weary land
[25:47] a shelter in a time of storm
[25:50] I remember the first time I ever spoke
[25:52] in tongues I was preaching at the Milton
[25:55] Baptist Church and I was out there
[25:56] preaching and I got wound up and all
[25:58] those doctors sitting there looking at
[26:00] me and the Holy Ghost Came Upon me like
[26:02] jumped out in the middle of the eyes I
[26:03] began to speak with tongues I thought
[26:04] well what's happening now I never knew
[26:07] anything about it
[26:08] when I started back I heard my lips say
[26:10] this I'm the rock in a weary land the
[26:13] tower The Refuge at the time of stroma
[26:16] who I wondered and everyone look at one
[26:18] another like geese in a yard looking
[26:20] like and I felt the same way because I
[26:22] didn't know
[26:23] but I know that something had happened
[26:25] to me and I found the tower
[26:28] a hiding place I never wanted nothing
[26:30] else since then but that spot that
[26:33] blessed had in place right in the line
[26:36] of duty right under the fire of the
[26:39] enemy they was look like all Native was
[26:42] trembling for them
[26:43] what is to do what kind of whole a
[26:46] conference when the church gets to a
[26:48] place that this one is doing that this
[26:50] one doing this everything upside down
[26:52] don't quit the church
[26:53] hula conference of a permitting
[26:56] somewhere
[26:57] Moses elected a place
[26:59] he got behind a rock I said Lord God
[27:03] greet Jehovah who met me in a burden
[27:06] Bush that experiences have never left
[27:08] I've done everything they told me to do
[27:10] I'm standing in the line of duty I
[27:12] brought your people here I just said he
[27:15] under has the pillar of fire deer stands
[27:17] for your army he has the mountains and
[27:19] the Red Sea what must I do Lord must I
[27:21] give myself up
[27:23] what must I do in other words do I quit
[27:25] what do I do
[27:26] and I could see Angels begin to set on
[27:29] wrong each I want a conference and after
[27:31] a while this Spirit of the Lord I can
[27:32] see the pillar of fire move over what
[27:34] was it there was a decision made what
[27:38] are going to do give us and go back and
[27:40] try again
[27:42] listen
[27:43] I take this tonight God never goes
[27:45] backward never send these people to go
[27:48] back to what Moody said sanki said Simi
[27:51] said go forward amen and I'm all the
[27:53] clues
[27:55] and this is this key scripture I wanted
[27:57] to get to tonight
[27:58] on Proverbs 24
[28:02] reading from verse 15 16 to 18 of
[28:06] community of 15 minutes from 16.
[28:09] and it says here
[28:11] for just man Proverbs 24 16.
[28:15] for a just man
[28:17] fallet seven times
[28:20] and Rises up again
[28:22] but the wicked shall fall into mischief
[28:26] verse 17.
[28:27] Rejoice not
[28:29] when thine enemy falled
[28:31] let no thine heart be glad when you
[28:33] stumbled least the Lord see it
[28:36] and then displease him
[28:38] and he turned away his right from him
[28:41] we want to take a little peek at this
[28:43] scripture for just man
[28:46] fallet seven times
[28:48] and Rise it up again
[28:49] but the wicked shall fall into mischief
[28:52] now I want you to note
[28:54] that there are two fallings here
[28:57] the Fallen adjustment
[29:00] and the Fallen of Awakened
[29:03] I want to say tonight
[29:04] Fallen is part of this journey
[29:08] the difference is
[29:10] how you are living
[29:12] when you fall
[29:14] the just man falls
[29:16] and the wicked for
[29:18] just
[29:19] or righteous
[29:21] is being upright and honest walking
[29:24] before God
[29:25] a just man will fall
[29:29] someone walking upright
[29:31] will face
[29:33] failure
[29:35] but it's his condition when he falls
[29:38] so thinking because you are serving the
[29:40] lord
[29:41] believe in his word you will not or
[29:44] cannot face failure is not correct
[29:47] if you think that way you will have
[29:49] disappointments
[29:51] a just man will fall
[29:55] not just once
[29:57] more than once
[29:58] the scripture declares seven times
[30:01] we tend to wipe out others on just one
[30:05] fall
[30:06] but adjustment
[30:09] Follet seven times more than once
[30:12] adjustment the key here he rises up
[30:16] again
[30:18] this is it friends don't quit
[30:22] press the button
[30:24] get back up
[30:26] and keep pressing on
[30:29] failure is not final
[30:31] Jehovah has
[30:33] the final scene that is Paul Hayes
[30:36] heavenly father I thank you Lord I don't
[30:38] know who this is for
[30:39] but Lord this is the word this is the
[30:42] truth sometimes we have fairy tales in
[30:44] our mind about saving you but this is
[30:47] your word Lord a righteous man may fall
[30:50] but you would hold them up God falling
[30:54] doesn't mean finish
[30:55] fully doesn't mean object failure and
[30:58] that's the final thing as the song says
[31:00] Jehovah has the final thing oh God we
[31:04] were born in sin and shape iniquity and
[31:06] they call us out and as we walk
[31:09] different things happen different
[31:10] tragedies different things we can't
[31:12] explain and we hold on to Romans 8 28 we
[31:15] know that all things work together for
[31:16] good to them that love you to them what
[31:19] they call the quantitative purpose
[31:20] sometimes they instruct us sometimes
[31:22] they rebuke us sometimes that guide us
[31:25] to grow us to mature us to form
[31:27] character in us but whatever it takes
[31:29] long it will take all these experiences
[31:31] to make us who we are
[31:34] it's not just what when we fall but the
[31:39] condition we are in in fallen father
[31:41] bless the people tonight those who are
[31:43] here in this virtual room here
[31:45] struggling those who are here who might
[31:47] be in some condition here Freedom
[31:49] tonight that they wouldn't think about
[31:50] quitted they wouldn't think about
[31:52] letting go and giving up or walking away
[31:54] but they will think about pressing the
[31:56] button
[31:57] press the button keep pressing on bless
[32:01] them tonight as they're getting in
[32:02] prayer in Jesus might ask it amen and
[32:05] amen God bless you I trust this
[32:07] exhortation tonight would have helped
[32:09] you in some way and be a blessing to you
[32:11] in some way that God what that your feet
[32:14] will be anointed in God
[32:16] and struggles and battles is part of
[32:19] this whole program that God has God be
[32:21] with you as we get on in prayer at this
[32:23] time
