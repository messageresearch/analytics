and amen and trust everybody is feeling fine uh good to see you brother Clarence uh there's a big reason you have to give to our thanks and praise and it certainly grateful to see everyone of you tonight on a Friday evening there are so many other things that could draw our attention and I love it when you know the Holy Spirit turns a corner um you know go like to do sometimes the unexpected you know we have things we expect things and and tonight I believe that Lord has something special for us in a special way um so I'm encouraging you to get in put on your seat belt for a few moments as you get into the wood um we thank God for those that are here and if you know someone is supposed to be here send them a message and tell them we have him we're having a time in the Lord on a Friday evening you know it's easy to get distracted with the cares of life and it's important for us to take a pause and come back to the basics of what God has called us for so by the grace of God I really appreciate um what has been happening uh through the word uh the last few weeks in particular has been truly a truly a blessing and normally an aquarity we would have for anything and we will have a crime of prayer a bit different tonight after we go to the scripture on the with the night so I have a bit of a title if I might see it um are you speaking a language that God understands are you speaking a language that God understands you know and I'm lining up with many of the teachings of the world they would have done over the last you know few prayer meetings where we're really honing in on prepping and thriving and dying and crying and you know the approach to pray and the approach to communication and and really as we delve deeper into the night we're recognizing it's more about how we say what we say and why we say what we see than what we actually say you know many people pray because it's just a routine is something that you're supposed to do and you want to be so cautious in approaching God because we want to get a result from God and the reality is God wants to give us a result you know he wants to granted his eyes of your heart more than you even want to ask for it you know and the thing is that desire must have the right motive and the right objective so um I know it wasn't but if you have your Bible we're gonna go to the book of First Samuel that will be where our study will come from tonight before we have a time of prayer on me like we said we're gonna have a time to pray in a different way but I want to go into the book of First Samuel and we're going to spend some time in full Samuel chapter one uh into first Samuel chapter 2 and this is a teaching on prayer um that really blessed my heart um and for those who have never studied this uh trust that will be a blessing to you um as well so first Samuel chapter one and you know how we may not have had Bible study for some time in this way um so it's the revision class so we're gonna take it slowly to make sure we get this billion point from it so everybody feeling fine everybody focused and you're not doing this as a side thing and you're you know you need to pay attention to this to get the best out of it all right and I know it's going to be a blessing to you so the Bible says in first time you were chapter one now there was a certain man or from a famous zohim of Mount Ephraim so it gives his history his pedigree as it was he's from Ephraim and his name was elkano the son of jeroham the son of elohu the son of tohu the son of Zeus and Aphrodite and being an appetite thought in from Context to be tighter Ephraim but if you study this appetite some biblical Scholars May argue that to some extent it me some would have been a bit of a derogatory too to some extent and we understand a bit why because it's almost it's speaking that he's going against the Green going against the Green of what his people would have been in his approach to God and the Bible goes on in verse two and he had two wives the name of the one was Hannah and the name of the other penina antenna had children but Hannah had no children the stream and this man went up out of his City yearly to worship and I love that he went out of the city he made the effort every single year he was consistent to worship and to sacrifice unto the Lord of hosts in Shiloh and this is very special because first Samuel is at an interesting spot in Scripture this introduces the prophet Samuel who's of great significance because the prophet Samuel is the one who we know will anoint King Saul who is the first king of Israel he will also anointing David the rightful true king for the king of Israel but this point as well is between the reign of the judges and the establishment of the monarchy as it were and it's what during the monati on the Solomon that the Temple of Jerusalem was built but before Istanbul of Jerusalem which was the center point of Israel's worship and where the high priests and all of this was done the players that existed before the Temple of Jerusalem was Shiloh you could have chosen to given your sacrifice in Bethel you could have gone to Mid spot to offer sacrifice it's a special effort to go to Shiloh so this man elkana wanted to bring his sacrifice in a certain place in a certain kind of way because particularly unique to Shiloh was this was the place the Ark of the Covenant would have rested so this was a spiritual significant place so the story that is being built here through spiritual history is the fact that this man elkana was a no joke brother he wasn't he wasn't playing games he had options he had places he could go he had different churches different locations but he chose to go to Shiloh every single year to bring his sacrifice and to worship he was a man that was consistent he was a man that was dedicated and it goes on and the two sons of Eli host me and Phineas the priest of the Lord were there and this has impact as well because we will find out later that at Shiloh where the Ark of the Covenant erected That was supposed to be the epicenter of worship for the children of Israel at that time then was in the camp because half me and Phineas the sons of the priests were tearing down were living in sin they were in the place where you should be but they were not living the kind of life you should live in that kind of a place are you with me so it draws an immediate contract that elkana is coming to Shiloh because he wants something out of going there but yet you have two sons of the priest who also are Shiloh but they are mortal for being there is very different from elkana being there not only so so again this is bringing to the floor that you could be in the same place you could be in a room with your anointing you could be in a piece of spiritual people and what your motive in your heart is is what determines what you get out of it anybody with me tonight all right verse 4 and when the time was that elkano offered so he gave the soccer position offering he gave the planet his wife and to all of her sons and her daughter's portions so this is that professional me when he sacrifices sacrificial meat he will give a portion to opinion and to all of her sons and her daughters but Uncle Hannah he gave a worthy portion he gave her extra the Bible actually says to be Amplified that he will give her a double portion because he loved Hannah and that's that's not the powerful thing there but the Lord had shut up her womb the Lord had shut up her womb and I mean you come back to that and verse 6 and her adversary and her adversary her rival as it were This Is War and it's not so much that Hannah is the aggressor Selena is the aggressor because she is seeing the love that elkana has for Hannah are you with me tonight and this study we are going to touches them two things it talks about sovereignty and we're gonna get into the sovereignty of God the grace of God the favor of God and how God allows things to happen to us so that one he can get the glory but to show that he could bless you despite stuff that he allowed to happen to you because it is not it is not that Hannah shut up her own womb it is not that something happened that caused this the Bible tells me that God did it the Lord had shut up her womb the Lord talk I'm having children and sometimes we wonder why God don't allow things to work out for us anybody with me tonight but behind God allowing things to not recall for us there's a deeper plan because God wants to bring something out of us this Hannah is an important person in the story and Narrative of scripture because it is the mother of Carnival he would be instrumental in raising Samuel would change his trajectory what if she encourages whether she if she teaches him good values if she admonishes him whatever interaction because the a mother's ability to shape how their children live is critical anybody with me tonight so verse 6 says and her adversary also provoke her soul to not be able to have children it's one thing to know that your business struggling it's one thing to know your children give in trouble it's another thing in the face of you dealing with your own issues there's somebody else who is now making a mockery of your opinion of your struggle of your challenge so if one thing's behind it to deal with her barrenness it's it's adding shorts that you wouldn't if I could say that when in the midst of your barrenness somebody is provoking you about it pointing you about it trusting you about it adding fear to these fire as it were to make it worse all of us have stressed in our lives you know that that's the reality of it it's something else when in the middle of your stress something comes at you like you say well I don't really need that much stress right now you know because I'm dealing with enough stress as it is I dealing with enough struggle and dealing with enough pain I dealing with enough issues as it is and that is how Karma would have been he is dealing with the seeming reproach as it were of going to the temple every year to give sacrifice and you're walking with your husband as it were and you're walking and you're watching his other wife with only children and you're watching it and it would have an impact on you because you wish you could have that too but on top of that her adversary made it a business because unfortunately gets to a point where there's a response where are you freaking anybody with me tonight because this is like putting pressure on proper pressure from scripture that the Nina was already started to try until she no kind of spirit and I don't know what you want to make you ever felt like your spirit broken you're trying to do something and then everything and then on top of it somebody else does the the something that just throws over the air does it work whatever Joy you had and I want you to understand the context this is not happening in the room this is not happening in Easton this is she is waiting until they get to church she's waiting until there's a place where you can get strength and Redemption and relief and you can pull your heart out of the Altar and it's in that place at that time she chooses to come and drive you screw them to stress her out because walk her soul to make her fresh and they're coming at you but making people work worse than you were feeling before anybody with me tonight I don't know if this is this is a context maybe you haven't gone through some stuff where you went through something and then somebody actually make it worse for you in a place on a time when you expected to get released there's only so much Chef people can take so also want us to go on verse seven and as he did so year by year so it wasn't one experience of publication it wasn't one encounter she had with the situation it is as if every time she goes to church to get a blessing something happened to take the blessing away anybody with me as if she's trying to get a breakthrough and something always there him knowing the Breakthrough anybody with me tonight so I want to get a bit a bit deeper here though I'm not going to be too wrong with you this is just to kind of encourager because the reality of it was this constant stress on Hannah affected Hannah's life it affected her walk it affected how old look it affected and I want to get to this the even the way she prayed anybody with me tonight verse seven and as he did so year by year when she went up to the house of the Lord saw people welcome therefore she wept and did not eat now this is not trying to be telling the fact this is the pain and the stress of whatever word attitude action look whispered Behavior it is easy it is easy for us to say don't study what people saying about you know friends that's very easy to tell someone you know but if you know somebody talking about you if you know somebody running you down and you in that experience it's a whole different experience there are many things you shake off there are many things that come to us and we don't allow it to bother us however the Nina was inspired was so destructive to Hannah's life that she cried in the Bible said she what and she stopped eating in other words she'll not appetite I have had experiences where news came to me and stood in front of me and according to anybody leave the appetite Shiloh the city sacrifice the sacrificial me being shared and I dealt that point was in front of you you're about to eat somebody said something to you on a trip off your appetite you're crying and you can't eat anymore anybody with me that's a real rough existence in fact I can imagine that Hannah would have had a struggle after a while to even go up to silo because this continuing activity of being oppressed would have had a longer till effect on her anybody with me they should be voted therefore she worked and did not eat then said Air Canada why because now now this why we have to go is not a question of the subject it is not the question of why you're crying you know I wanted to appreciate this there is no way that Hannah would have withheld the reason she was crying from her husband the question why we both go is more of why you're crying about this versus why you're crying anybody with me in other words this doesn't want to cry this stuff you're crying about with it but the reality is I want to appreciate the emotions that honor is in the reality that we can too many people cry on and off until somebody will stop crying when they're going through their pain or their or their or their two of them or their heart ache anybody with me somebody who's Eng for you but they still have to resolve their grief because it's something that affecting their heart anybody with me tonight he says why with us now and why it is down in other words don't let it affect you so much that you're not even going to eat especially given in fact that every time I take all this food I've given you a double portion every time we take away food do you think about extra food for her because you love her so yeah because he keeping me the the waiting version for her eaten because she is using her appetite by virtue or it wasn't physical abuse and I wasn't being physically beaten but words are powerful Looks Could Be powerful suggestions could be powerful gospel could be powerful anybody with me tonight and yes she'll even go up to the temple to eat they went to this company to make sacrifice worship when you go to the when you go to Sally you're going to kill anybody with me so let's go in verse 8 then her husband why we push down and why he press down not and why is thy heart green the only word he's saying rise up above this stuff and I want to encourage us tonight this is out of a situation not like that because the people who you can still have the most in a situation because these words and and ask for the husband said why are you ever eaten why your heart grieved he threw enough people to talk you say I'm not I better today than temperament showing that he knows you know but he's saying that oh God you have me forget that woman you have me and I am what for you anybody with me tonight so the hospital is doing everything he could do to try to help his wife through the struggle that the reality is it's an individual of fear it's an individual struggle and while the world would have had the level of encouragement to her the reality is I want to understand you see it in the conversation later that during every visit to Shiloh I know would have had to pray because you're going up there to pray you're going up there sacrifice so here we go now verse nine anybody with me tonight so this is speaking now upon encounter in verse nine we don't know how many years with Hannah having to deal with this stress this is what I would call unnecessary stress this stress that have nothing to do with anything of real significance to her that she has to do with it so Hannah rose up after they have eaten in Shiloh and after they are drunk now Eli The Creep and that's why I'm getting the context are you speaking a language that God understands or God doesn't understand because you see it I'm not prayed every time the decrease he was praying was not the kind of prayer going on with it here oh anybody with me okay so the Constitution woman it was just the way she was praying because of why she was praying and how she was praying foreign and after they are drunk now Eli the priest sat upon a seat by a post of the Temple of the Lord and verse 10. so it's painting a picture Hannah is praying they said and she was in bitterness of soul and praise unto the Lord and wept so but this time this encounter was different and said oh lord of hosts if there was indeed look on the Affliction of thine handmaid and remember me and not forget that her need but will give unto thy hand made a man-child then I will give him unto the Lord all the days of his life and they saw no River come upon his head so somehow in this particular year year after year she was coming but this particular year she said something different and the Bible said she made us go she she wrote a vote she said something different this year than she had ever said every year before and it came to pass verse 12 as she continued praying before the Lord that Eli marked him out so Eli was watching her because even as the priest I'm sure he knows who comes consistently I'm sure you know and he's watching how he's Machina he's watching her mouth no this is where it gets interesting verse 30 now Hannah she's fake in her heart so this world it wasn't even worse that feel I could have heard therefore Eli thought she had been drunken verse 14 and Eli said unto her how long will thou be drunken put away thy wine from thee and Hannah answer them said no my Lord I am a woman of sorrowful spirit I'm a woman with a despairing spirit I have drugs neither why not strong drink that I've poured out my soul before the Lord called not thine handmade for a daughter of Belial so in other words this daughter of the reality and do not regard your meat server that's a wicked or worthless woman so out of abundance of my complaint and grief have I spoken either to friends that line right there is the key to this whole thing in other words in the other characters for I have spoken until now out of my great concern and better provocation you kept what do you think that Eli do you think that Eli all the prayers I've been praying all these years was because of bitterness and provocation in other words because what I just went through here was different than every time I pray before because I've prayed in my heart it wasn't a real world thing anymore it wasn't me trying to extract anymore last Sunday when I preach I talk about dropping your horse and in your heart you already don't want to see somebody blessed this is somebody who is praying this form of prayer but the prayer was a better friend the prayer had a wrong motive had a wrong desire because she's staying here was out of great control and better provocation now when you under business and you understand or upset or whatever in other words Karma was coming she lost her appetite she upset she climbed and she prayed and God said another prayer because you're approaching me out of bitterness provocation your approach me out of anger you're Fortune because you obsessed about the situation you're not any right Spirit about the matter and the reason your wonders child is to get back at this woman it is because she is provoking you you're praying to myself to win or you don't hear me tonight so she reach a point where she can come sensory please but before this moment I've been training business but something changed in that moment in prayer had a change or I I don't know if you get to miss them are you speaking a language that God could understand he was not just the activity of prayer because she has been praying for a child she need a child she wanted a child because a child would have put an end to her suffering is she could produce a child the criticism trampoline would have stopped immediately but God had her born year after year after year until she changed the way she prayed about the marker God could have answered the prayer any place here we could have answered the Plenty second year he could have answered yes but the way she prayed about the matter was not right it was as a response to what the Nina was saying all the time I'm going to want to to play out of dungeon brother wanted to play out of anger but I don't want you to play out of frustration what I want you to pray outcome and material and democracy or as a response to what other people do for you against you about you the pain has to be the right motive behind me prayer that the only language that God could understand anybody with me tonight I will do it again when Eli challenged because Eli are collect something different about her for him to intervene he's telling a report I would hate to believe I wouldn't want to believe the only person playing people are coming to these temples who sacrifice he is something about this woman catches his attention to her because he still lives moving on resonated and I said no my Lord I'm a woman of Sparkle spirit I'm drunk you know why not strong bring but I poured out my soul before the Lord for the Lord in that particular moment all she reached a point where the words of a prayer chained to say Lord if you're given the sun in other words put context it was not about Selena anymore days of his life I wonder somebody else different because I want to have a sound of the three of you oh Lord help us tonight have you been praying wrong Lord bless my business because I mean and the rest of that the real reason because despite the words you say God knows behind me or whatever I did a study some time ago I didn't even recall it when we talked about motives of the heart and the Bible says and I say people always miss interpreting scriptures he asked and receive not because you have a myth that you may consume it upon your Allah and then he amplify that to James 4 3 you ask God for something and do not receive it because you asked with wrong motives out of selfishness or with an unrighteous agenda that's the scripture so born so Jesus touching on the issue that Hannah had to deal with because for 100 words of the prophet Samuel shall be a certain kind of mother foreign let's go then Eli answered and said one second then Eli answer and said go in peace and the god of Israel grant me by petition that thou hath asked of him and she said let that handmade find Grace and thy sight so the woman went away and they eat and her continent was no more sad so that encountered in prayer chainsaw from a woman who had an ask about her she couldn't eat all that have happened but now she had that breakthrough in prayer where she aligned a prayer for something that God can recognize God could understand a language God could say I like that and God got your favor Eli to give her a word of comfort a word of Solace a word of peace I said go in peace the god of Israel Grande by petition Hallelujah and they woke up in the morning early and worship before the Lord had retained and came to the house and Rama and elkana knew Hannah his wife and the Lord remembered her oh my God oh the Lord will remember us tonight if the Lord remember you he knows what you need to know he knows what to make you happy you know but if there's a wrong native along the desire around a German day God kind of bless it and more time it is your motive it is your intention it is your desire that's who only might be blessing a good one to give you all alone with Bridge be judges for the king oh my this is not just a Prophet this will be bridge between all the judges and the kings of a god of her were set by this prophet Samuel and it happened with the right kind of woman to raise this kind of come set up until she was provoked so much until the provocation drove us to go deeper to figure greater purpose than her frustration than her convocation than her grief oh you don't hear me tonight when anyway he was praying hasn't been working you need to check what you're praying for if you know there's any answers to the prayers that you've been praying you need to check what you're asking for because God could only bless you when you ask the right way there is a language that God understands he has so many Prophet was relating his experience with his killers and sister happy was right there as you heard it she said the right thing that language God understood he trust your property thank you for whatever you want she said the right thing I understand that language that language does open a blessing that language is open up favor anybody with me tonight the Centurion come to Jesus and say Mr want is sick you don't need to come just speak the word and the birth of Jesus marveled at the Centurion people the language different school that along with the faith triggers something and have money take home and I said what time is it here are you speaking a language that God understands you look through it when you read through scripture there are many examples because God speaks about the Centurion Street even the thief and the cross one thing dividing Jesus saying this about the other one just say remember me it wasn't a complex prayer but it was his sincerity it was the humility it was a language that resonates with God I heard somebody say recently I was showing everybody a few days ago God gets a lot of prayer requests millions and millions of people telling a prayer request and he asked yourself what makes your standout I love that question everybody is continuing and her continual request request request requests tonight that's Jesus only teaching you know Jesus results in the concept of your language that God understands is the frequency of Prayer because of what the system is persistence is about frequency continuous it's Earnest it gets freezing across the attracting God there's thankfulness in your prayer there's obedience in your prayer there's reverence in your prayers there's Contrition in your prayer there's submission in your prayers all of this forms are language and the language is not just about the words you're using because Hannah was at the point where she wasn't when he was at work she was in her heart and God understood that the language of the heart anybody with me tonight is this helping anybody to check your prayer life and how you're playing so it's not just what are you praying for and how are you praying for it let's go let's finish all this tonight verse 19. and the words of early in the morning in the morning and came to the house in Rama and elkana knew Hannah his wife and the Lord remembered her remembered would remember us tonight and I was thinking you know we're talking about continues in the New Testament there was the memorial in heaven because they come in your crime come back to that question about there are so many prayer requests is there any Corner if they were not a paper about you had a memorial well you don't hear me tonight Memorial cemetery and I see somebody I will cross somebody else have something bigger because I'm bigger this was gonna be a real great man there because there's a Memorial Day to speak about him even after he's gone that's a memorial celebrated the sacrifice of somebody's life foreign where's my where's my Memorial is you know you need to see us building up a memorial it is a sacrifice is a commitment it's a dedication it's the number of pieces coming together to create something real that speaks about you that you're preparing by all of your prayers I could remember the time Messiah remember the time you cry because depression is that frustration you'll go through that but there's a memorial because you put it through all the negativity I'm feeling less than I'm feeling inferior my feelings traveled and struggled and affected and depressed I'm going to depression and she had to overlook that and separate herself with the shorter for depression this woman if she wouldn't shut her mouth if she didn't stop talking about the amount of thoughts you have to overcome to reach a point to say I want a son now anybody with me but the government to say Lord I want something you know but you know what whenever back to you because there's nothing about me anymore I realized it was what I wanted but I really wasn't care about what you wanted even Jesus had to pray he says if it is possible then just go past that was his career though oh you don't hear me tonight the instinctive prayer Jesus had was if it were possible we are discard personal meaning if I can apply and keep a long time because it was impressed if it is possible let me get a new car but no one left nothing I will if you don't know or you don't hear me tonight can I say that one more time if it is possible no longer a new house nevertheless everything going to wear your new house but are you praying with a language that God will understand that put his will into the equation not only that you know when you go back to this vowel when you go to this ball I heard somebody say it doesn't Hannah make Gora shareholder in the style called camera in other words but you have ownership I've given your ownership I've given you I've given it back to you yeah everything is strong my life is not my own anybody Wiggly I hope this is an interruption to our Friday routine to of course life and prayer and always and our choices and our differences differently I guess every time I read that thing again let's go on therefore it came to pass when the time was come after that Hannah had to see that she bear son and call his name Samuel Hallelujah saying because I have asked him of the Lord and the man elkana and all his household went up to offer unto the Lord the yearly sacrifice and his vow that Hannah was not up so she said unto us but I will not go up until the child be wind and then I shall bring him that he may appear before the Lord and they abide forever senator do what she must be good carry until they have win him only the Lord established his word so they open about and give us some until she win him and when she had William she took him with her with three blocks and one ether a flower and a bottle of wine and brought him into the house of the Lord in Shiloh and the child was young and they saw a Bullock and brought the child to Eli and he said oh my Lord as thy Soul living my Lord I am the woman that stood by me here praying unto the Lord for this child I prayed and the Lord had given me my petition which I asked of him therefore also I have lent him to the Lord as long as he liveth he shall be lent to the Lord and He Worship the Lord there What a Mighty context without them just a few more verses in chapter two and I like that chapter 2 verse 1 starts and Hannah prayed so there's no questions so what I love about this as well this is not I guess what I want from God to our suffering and Hannah prayed and said and and this is our contribution prayer before we go into prayer we're still going to do things a little different I haven't played and said my heart rejoiced it in the Lord my wall is exalted in the Lord and that's why for this study just tell your prayer and the sovereignty of God and Hannah is actually almost speaking about the sovereignty of God in this prayer right my heart rejoices in the Lord my horn my horn in every part is like my strength is lifted up in the Lord so my heart Rejoice that your heart rejoice in the Lord tonight is he the thought of your strength my strength is lifted up in the Lord outside of the Lord there's nothing to lift me up that's what when people say they're struggling have you gone to the Lord because all the words I can say to you tonight is nothing compared to when your strength or your own is exalted in the Lord she goes and my mouth is enlarged over my name because I rejoice in thy salvation there is none actually as the Lord for there is none beside me neither is there any Rock like I work on talk no more so exceeding proudly less than elegancy come out of your mouth for the Lord is a god of knowledge and by him actions are weighed this is a woman who is praying who has been true from God the bones of the mighty men are broken and there that color are greeted with strength he's saying this strong the board of Enlightenment they are broken but they are stumbled you could talk about herself have hired out themselves for bread in other words God is shaking things up all that were down for them God let them up you know that was higher established go and bring them down we saw plenty of God see the customers I was a barren woman there was no hope for me yes but look at me now it wasn't out of the boss because he said it earlier that's not our country much about what the Monster exceeding crowd he is talking about the humility through the pain of the experience and the resolution of her issues was in prayer it wasn't counseling it wasn't therapy it wasn't imposter it wasn't a message it was in prayer she wrestled and she broke too she played true or something can you still hear me yeah can you hear me fine struggled and prayed through and still have many children with black people the Lord kill it and make it alive so she's drawing that contract of the sovereignty of God he bring it down to the Grave and bring it up in other words he take people down to the grave and he can resurrect you too he's so friendly of God the Lord make it poor and make it rich you think it's you making a sandwich anybody with me tonight what I do in this am I working hard Hannah is preaching a
