do have a special message this morning let's stand hebrews 10 19-25 and josh jonah chapter 1 1-3 um let's read hebrews 10 having therefore brethren boldness to enter into the holiest by the blood of jesus by a new living way which he had consecrated for us through the veil that doesn't say his flesh and having an high priest over the house of god let us draw near with a true heart in full assurance of faith having our hearts sprinkled from an evil conscience and our bodies washed with pure water let us hold fast the profession of our faith without wavering for he is faithful that promised and let us consider one another to provoke on the love and the good works not forsaking the assembling of ourselves together as the manner of some is but exhorting one another and so much the more as we see the day approaching want to read from jonah in chapter one now the word of the lord came unto jonah the son of amitai saying arise go to nineveh that great city and cry against it for their wickedness has come up before me but jonah rose up to flee unto darshes from the presence of the lord and went down to dropper and he found the ship going to tashish so he paid the fear thereof and went down into it to go with them unto tarshish from the presence of the lord that's my heart i pray father god we thank you for your love and your presence and your word today lord there are scriptures everywhere books tapes bibles everywhere but some parts somewhere this word have to become flesh and come alive help us tonight help us today that this word will come alive and the word will become flesh become visible among us confirm a word with signs wonders and miracles on your opponent of the holy ghost bless those connected to us do they may you inspire them wherever they are whether in churches or homes may the presence of god just be released oh god and bless them and jesus may ask it amen you may be seated blessed be the name of the lord glory is right amen glory to god so many happy to be here this morning so good to see you making the effort to come out come out early and pray up the service and worship that's what you're called to do and god will bless you amen amen our title let us provoke one another to love and good works let us provoke one another to love and good works another question who is responsible for the bride seventh under reviver it's the question i have to ask who is responsible for the bride 700 revival and i have a thought god three words two pieces three words god expect results and two action is caused god expect results and action is caused you know you hear but imam said you got to do something for something to happen you have to throw up a rock and then whirlwind something happened you've got to do something for something to happen the axe told jesus that the wine ran out he said fill some pots and draw water you got to do something your car just said there is no wine there is no wine saying there was no wine wouldn't produce wine he said get some water in that pot and then we could do something with what we do we have water water is potentially convert to wine i just i just bypass the pressing the grapes i'll bypass all the process and when you're poor you'll get mine could somebody say amen you've got to have something to start with something to work with the people are hungry five thousand to be fed what do you have oh well we have a little boy with five loaves and two fishes that's good enough that's good enough because we have something we could start with because if we could only get started come on now god said god will do the rest say god will do the rest give the lord a shout hallelujah if we can only get started if we can only get started god will do the rest if we could get started you must want to get started you can't sit there you must want to get started and action is caused accent don't just happen you got to do something for something to happen oh glory to god hallelujah are you with me glory to god amen all right let's get down in the word now patmo's vision but the branham was speaking about the vision of christ here white as well he was explaining it talking about daniel ancient of days a judgment was set now i want to ask you something i'm speaking to you lukewarm church 10 virgins went out to meet the lord five of them wise five foolish now watch the books was open daniel 7 9. the books were open that's the book of the sinner and another book was open who came with him the church from the rapture 10 thousand times thousands times thousands with him minister to him that's his wife that's the bride amen listen everybody will be accounted for [Music] i don't care who they feel they are how rich they are how powerful they are everyone will be accounted for because there's a book and that book have names and whether you feel you're in it or not in it or whatever it is you'll still have to be accounted for now watch judgment was set the books were open not a book was opened which was a sleeping version and every man was judged from the book you'll be asked to give a reason why you didn't what then you know better now you know better you might not have known it before but you do know where where if the righteous case will be saved where would the sinner on the ungodly appear the one who rejects who knows better and rejects it where will they appear feet like brass divine judgment his here flames of his eyes flame of fire his feet like brass voice his voice here we go sound of many waters voice of many waters what does waters represent if you want to mark it it represents the water's dark source revelation 17 15 is thickness and multitudes so that he's breaking it down and he's revealing what that means voice of many waters voice of many waters what is his voice it's the judgment the voice of the ministers through the holy spirit that cried out to the people in every age standing there the voice of many waters cried out thickness and multitudes the voice of those seven stars in his hand to every church age preaching the baptism of the holy ghost preaching the baptism in jesus name speaking in tongues the power of god the resurrection of christ second coming divine judgment the voice of many waters coming forth from the one that looked like the son of man so in other words all what was folding through the ages was christ so when in the glory of revelation the voice came out it was the voice of many waters but it was christ's life living out through the seven ages oh hallelujah it was always christ hallelujah right now it is christ living out his word in her pride hallelujah do you believe that what will it be the voice of many waters praise god what is it what it will be to know here we go that you said in the meetings heard that you should get right with god and receive the holy ghost and that drifting soul to hear the voice speak out in that meeting you set in and heard the judgments of god preached and refused it the great falls just below the great cataracts that take you to our eternal dome it's like you're going we don't have that here in trinidad but in other countries have it a river and it goes to fall and you fall over and fall straight down the great cataracts the falls voice of many waters fought personage of him voice of many waters how are you gonna do it when it's recorded in glory when the voice tonight is recorded your voice is recorded here we go your thoughts are recorded as a man tinkered in his heart so is he and your thoughts are louder in heaven than your voice is on earth as a man think in his heart so is he so then we have to speak with our mouths what we really have in our hearts because it wouldn't be in harmony isn't that right so watch god knows the thoughts and intents of your heart he knows all about it he said to the pharisees you hypocrite how can you speak good things went out of the abundance of your heart speaking them out calling me master and good and i could look right to you and see you a hypocrite you don't mean that you don't mean god bless you you mean to say that because you want to say that but if you really mean that you will mean that hallelujah can't be hateful for somebody got restored they can't be upset because somebody bring god bring back somebody from hell you can't be angry because god save someone and redeem someone and a backslider find his way back home you can't be angry you have to be possessed [Applause] god listen god has leave all to find one sinner caught us with all the 99 to find that one sheep you can sit there on some self-righteous troll as if you would lose his seat to judge anything oh give the lord a shout of prayers there is no man out here that could judge me hallelujah glory to god we don't stand here as some servant of man we stand here as a servant of god [Music] you won't be seated hallelujah glory hallelujah god has said behold i send you a bunch of ministers no he said behold i sent you elijah the prophet god sent us a prophet what we know god we don't have to hear a bunch of men come on same and somebody he produced the lord hallelujah i told the people in africa i told them in europe it's about you the fifo ministry is not for themselves is that to have big men and raising their arm like if there's a bodybuilding contest who greater than who who more powerful than who it's for the perfection of the change it's for the work of the ministry it's for the anything on the body till we all come give the lord a shout of prayer to the unity of the faith not the master of the faith not the destruction of the faith not more splendors of the faith no but the unity come on give the lord a shout that prayers we are looking for men who want the faith restored ah i have a unity of the faith man you may be seated oh glory to god and somehow somewhere along our own when the season turned the spirit turn has to take the people back to the bible where every word is god my god just think about it how much books you have around the world today christian books bibles tapes all kind of stuff and it's just laying there as thoughts as words people talk about and share about enough camps about and have conventions about but when is that word coming out of there [Applause] but abandoned said we see it the word lania and somebody come and make it live that's what brother branham did he take malachi 4 and wrap himself up in it and the world became flesh and he became one witness message oh hallelujah praise god and you knew that was that elijah [Applause] amen in that same way you've got to see where the bride where you fit him oh hallelujah what will it be on that day when the voice thunders out of many waters many church ages forming out i want to ask you something else let me say something to you people now you drift in soul you poor drifter drifting over the great cataract under be careful in the spirit realm that's you see in the spirit realm humanity is like blackness people just coming through remember 70 years is as what a thousand years is one day with the lord so 70 years is a short time people born like a flash day out oh oh that's what god's seeing every day flashes just flashes people born die born that flashes every day so when god tell abraham hold on for isaac god can i tell him it's only 25 years but god knows what a man is like you tell him our next 25 years again i promise you know what that man say only 24 years nine months you'll see me right there in church that's whole man is so god just throw the problem say hold that just say until ah hallelujah god gave abraham wait for isaac he's coming and abraham's staggered nut every year he's coming and sarah getting grumpier every year but he is still coming fixed here i don't want to cook no more food but he is still coming fear i don't want to earn his clothes but he is coming oh say him and somebody fear terry is upset but isaac is still coming glory what's the problem there is no problem god spoke to abraham god did not speak to sarah abraham spoke to sarah what god told him and god can't lie what are you saying god will test you with your wife god will test you with your husband god will test you with your children god will test you with your job god will test you with your neighbor i'm seeing some people just watching me they don't want to say amen because they only hear tests and they may test but when you say amen that's him and to me i i feel alive now be careful it'll be a horrible thing when you know there's no stephen for you then you can't get saved then you know your doom lays before you when you know within a few minutes you hear the voice speak out depart from me you workers of iniquity into everlasting fire which is prepared for the devil and his angels you will know when you hear the great falls roaring of those voices of those meetings while you were passing out of this what a horrible thing what a nightmare don't let it happen to you repent get right with god now while you can get right hallelujah who praise god question and answers no but the branham is it true that have been you born since christ came will be saved what a hundred and forty four thousand other predestinated ones to be sealed where the holy ghost what is their mission there about three questions in one the first one is it true that every jew born since christ that came into the world is to be saved he said no nothing will be saved only those whose names were put on the lamb's book of life before the foundation of the world jew or gentile that's all the book holds that mystery and the book is only unfolding it now watch watch not each one's name but what the mystery of the book is while it is calling those names the book doesn't say leave it is to be saved in this time of the church age or alma neville no it doesn't say that it just shows the mystery it unfolds a mystery of what the thing is and we ourselves by faith believe it so when you come here you come here to catch the mystery and nobody can catch it for you you can send somebody to keep your doctor's appointment you are sick can you send somebody let the doctor check you for me that makes no sense you've got to keep the appointment yourself and you have our appointment with the supernatural that nobody can keep you ordained for it you are predestinated to it [Applause] question what happened to the born-again believers who are in various denominations but not in the bride of christ what happens to them i think we explained a while ago they go into the tribulation they are martyred in the tribulation they'll be killed did not die in the old age any tribulation sorry it will be it's already on you know what do you think isis is doing what thing spirit upon them is doing it's already a demonstration of what's coming you know hallelujah oh you know getting it all right you know you know what that guy is doing but that is what gonna happen in the tribulation but we're trying to fight me no i'm preaching the word i'm trying to provoke you [Applause] until love and good works provoke you ever provoked somebody yet of course you know that a lot of provokers but we're not talking about that kind of provocation we're talking about sticking somebody provoking somebody going home by somebody telling them you're coming to pick them up to carry them to church i'm not hearing it tell them you're coming to pray with them and you're bringing the box of pizza with you we will eat after we pray come on come on what i'm saying oh give the lord some praises people we're gonna have a time this morning hallelujah hallelujah glory okay here we go the bible said the rest of the dead lived not for a thousand years or expired then there was a resurrection and they then comfort the both the just and the unjust which was judged by christ and the bride christ and the bride the man and his wife he came to the earth for ten thousand times ten thousand of his saints his bride judgment was set the books are open books open another book open which is the book of life he separated from them the goats from the sheep that had nothing to do with the bride she was standing there in judgment the queen and the king together i was expecting a bigger email than that because i expect the wife to respond because you're talking about king and queen we're talking about christ and the bride i mean if the church member don't want to say amen that's them but i'm talking about the bride nobody but the bible said his wife had made herself ready i mean i have a message to speak the wife hallelujah so i'm expecting the wife to respond are you with me give the lord a shout out praise people [Applause] all right he came with his saints his wife judgment said sheep was served from goats the church the people in nomination that are genuine christian who receive the message now they will never see it it will never be preached them those in mixed crowd who it's preached to it go right over the top of the head unless the names in the book of life now there will be good people and they will be raised up again and give them a trial and be judged by the very group that preached to them they'll be judged by the very group that preached to them the very group that preached to them they will be judged by them because that would be lamb's fight oh hallelujah that will be the pride isn't that something don't you know the saints shall judge the earth they'll be preached to they'll be preached to by the very same people that witness to them of the message that come out of it come out of what you're in you have a great opportunity to be changed you'll have to let your lust and your desires lead you you can let christ take a hold upon your life and be transformed to be like him you don't have to remain as you are oh hallelujah people find way too evangelical we need together with some deep stuff but the hypocrites that pass through this message is you realize god going for a new crop [Music] you see another crop going to grow out the bride is now about to be called people just making up numbers all along thank god you are the escaped ones thank god you escaped the pope the escape force anointed they escaped interpretation they escaped spiritual dictators yesterday self-appointed [Applause] bishops you escape them you are free this is the sovereign church of the living god we have no bishop over us we have no man over us the holy ghost is in charge [Music] oh get the lord we are free [Music] glory hallelujah you want to be seated we don't have no minister's association to listen to we got to hear what someone doing and what someone preaching and someone is saying no we don't have to do that we have a direct line it's fast it's not a dial-up it's direct high-speed connection to heaven oh hallelujah fresh voice comes wrong hallelujah voice going up and down ministering spirit ministering to those that are heirs of salvation all the holy cross is here the spirit is here the spirit and the price they come oh hallelujah blessed be the rock of our salvation let's go question if the church is saved even though she does not go in the rapture as i believe you taught she must go through the tribulation for pre-fine but what about these that are dead how will they prepare fight that's the question answer the bride don't need no purification she's already purified and those that are dead watch that live under justification certification they live to the light that they had and whatever they went through and their persecutions but now in this rapturing time there will have to come a time now that this bride that rejects the head part of the bride what he's saying is the church that rejects the head part of the bride will have to suffer for her rejection because the gospel was made plain to them back there like it's made plain to you today see it's made plain so you have done had all those years and examples the seals is open the church aid is laid out everything else it's just so plain you can't miss it the minister's making want to make it complicated but he said write division and make it plain god take a man with no education to bring the greatest revelation that we could understand it that it could be made plain glorious hallelujah he didn't bring dr hooly harley he brought the 20th century prophet [Applause] hallelujah glory to god let the doctor keep his doctorate but god said the prophet but the word of the lord but thus hear the lord [Applause] that can't fail hallelujah praise god that a fool shouldn't hear hallelujah praise the name of the lord hallelujah praise god blessed be the name ah glory to god you have to forgive me you know but let's find my bones verse 9 says stay yourselves and wonder cry ye out and cry they are drunken but not with wine they stagger but not with strong drink for the lord had poured out upon you the spirit of deep sleep not sleeping this deep sea bear deep sleep not name waking you up god poured upon them spirit of deep sleep watch and not close your eyes the prophets your rulers the seers that you covered and the vision of all is become to you as the words of a book that is sealed which men deliver to them that is learned and saying read this i pray thee and he said i cannot for it is healed so the learner said i can read it because it is closed to me and the book is delivered to him that is not learned saying read this i pray thee and he said i'm not learned so i can't read wherefore here we go the lord said for as much here we go are you ready as these people draw near me with their mouth and with their lips do honor me but have removed their heart far from me and their fear here we go towards me is taught by the precept of men instead of hearing god who is the word the affair of god is taught by the precept of men so they don't really fear god they fear man [Applause] hallelujah because if you fear god you don't care what men think and what men say [Applause] that's why elijah said it wasn't for jesus i wouldn't even talk to you guys it's only because a righteous man is in your midst that i'm having this conversation oh hallelujah oh give the lord some praises people because there's only more praise no talk mouth worship no sincerity because of that hear this verse therefore behold i will proceed to do a marvelous work among these people even a marvelous work and a wonder for the wisdom of their wise men shall perish and the understanding of the prudent men shall be heared oh hallelujah god dropping sleep deep sleep god shut the eyes and shutting her and god said i'm gonna do a marvelous work i'm gonna cause a wonder that's how you gonna be are you gonna be a sign and you're gonna be a wonder oh glory to god [Applause] my people shall never be ashamed it shall come to pass afterwards that i'll pour out my spirit young men shall see visions [Applause] oh hallelujah praise the lord praise the lord hallelujah you may be seated expectation a minister cannot be a revival there's no preacher can bring a revival he doesn't pack it with him the only thing he can do so why is the people have this kind of minister's thing my my minister might you know why is the minister teaching the people like that that they are being glorified that they have been magnified the bible said the lord magnified joshua but these people might find himself in front of people and the people looking up to them and the bible said try the spirits so when they always say let me try them they all know and we say we're gonna try it because the prophet said try it and never again must it happen that false things come in without being tried try the spirit the bible said so if a man claims something try it see if it's right if it's right we work with it if it is not right we give it the boots and we kick it right out could somebody say man so i walk with my boots in case i need a kick could we give the lord a shout the praise you to understand we're in a war do you want the siren of war and god promised a revival who is responsible for that revival [Applause] oh glory glory glory hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah who is responsible and god expect results god expect a bunch of people sitting down jesus if you abide in me and my word of god in you oh glory to god you shall ask what you will and it shall be done unto you say after me god expect results it again god expect results one more time go and expect results give the lord a shout said john 15. jesus said i am the vine my father he's a husband man he has a job every branch of me that doesn't matter he will cut it because he's a husband man he in a cotton business any brand that produce he'll cut it to produce more and hearing is my father glorified that you'll be at much fruit come on now here comes our tree be coming for fruit take the lord our prayers offer him that's why peter said second bill 1 4 add to your faith virtue these are bible principles there's a parable here's talk about a man a king or businessman you have servants you have discernment you give one a talent one so much 50 100 and so on he said i'm going away do what what you want to do the one with the hundred make 200 150 make 100. the one with one human unhide it when the man come and see but this one you know we multiplied this other one multiplied this one he did nothing with it he stood still he was waiting on the lord he was waiting to see what the others are doing he was in the wrong crowd because there's watching the others who were with him he was recognized there doing something because action is caused so this guy was just sitting on it he said i know he's a hard man and i bury what you give me and to keep it safe that's the problem with people today they want to offend nobody they don't want to upset nobody they're taking it easy they're playing it safe they want to be careful and choose their words so they don't even hear from god knowing what everybody's saying that walked who softly tipped you in before them but when god called jonah the word of the lord came to jonah and god tell jonah i want you to go to nineveh and cry out not whisper in their ears cry out bless out boss them hit their way it hurts stop stop support it in france i was telling burma triples not one not two three people love the principle he's a nice guy no doctrine praying for the sick going by back this method is drove over everybody loved the prophet but that's the first pull so even you see him and i'll tell him if it's not a picture with the phones i have no any first book you hold that picture you frame that picture that foot's perfectly looking nice when the second pull come it's to rebuke spirits and prophesy of a temple if you see that picture i can hold back no more trinities of the devil i can't hold back no more woman preachers and false i can't hold back no more jessie bell religion ripping through the whole thing oh yeah he's no longer the nice prophet but jesus had the same thing feed the multitude heal the sick raise the dead nice nice prophet from galilee but then jesus had to hit them hard he bunch of hypocrites hallelujah who actually knew the fleet of the wrath and so forth straighten them out because he was prophesying a typical coming a word coming oh hallelujah and the turtle is a spoken word hallelujah the temple is a king's sword the temple is a ten vision isn't that right the turtle is the cat's rainbow trout the turquoise for the bride god sent a point to get you and the third pearl is the priest of the doomed preacher eternal loss oh hallelujah which part of the pool you want i want to be pulled into christ i want to be pulled into the holy ghost i want to be pulling to the revival [Applause] oh glory hallelujah praise the name of the lord praise god hallelujah so no minister can bring a revival he doesn't pack it with him the only thing he can to be do is just be loyal to god in his word and the revival has to come by the people in your home in your life it has to come by the people and if god promises a revival they'll be going to have it let's make ready for it if god promise you to heal let's make ready for it oh glory to god i don't care what's contrary what's wrong i hope to see it if god's telling it i believe it anyhow i'm expecting it and if you're expecting it you'll be here for it oh hallelujah but branham said they missed him to seal the living word manifested in the flesh by the word that has promised to do these things she held the traditions she held the substitute blood instead of the real blood because she held those traditions you see they for years they were killing lambs and goats and bullocks and that was accepted until christ come that was a substitute until the reality come and people don't like change they like to go with the flow of tradition so jesus was wrecking their traditions so it's very problematic because this is not how we are custom doing it you know we we're custom bringing our bulls and goats and so on like that jesus said i am the lamb of god you know what i mean he come to bring a whole new order all together so he was rocking the whole thing he was shaken up when they thought he came to fight he said my kingdom is not of this world if my kingdom was of this world my men will fight for me but i belong to another kingdom that's all together jesus began to speak certain things to them he said when they say go here go there go there like you want to do no look at that look at that look at that he said forget about it behold the kingdom is within you oh hallelujah when you look here look here look here you have to go here you have to go here you have to join here you have to connect here forget about it behold the kingdom who is responsible for this revival if the minister can't bring a revival who who is there anybody know the answer to that question that's a powerful question who is responsible to bring every fiber somebody got to give an account somebody got to own up i want to see who is responsible for bringing a revival i just told you i am not sit down a minute so i am exhilarated [Music] and these two other ministers also they're off the hook let me hear them say amen only off the hook because i just read for you no minutes i could bring it so don't try to come here and try to bring no revival you can't bring it hallelujah you supposed to preach the word but the people they they got to answer the question we need our answer to that question we need to answer today division is being made plain glory you wanna be seated brother branham said no listen that's the reason today the revivals that we're supposed to have we have the nominational revivals we haven't had a real estate no no no no no he said four times five times no sir we don't think we got revivers we haven't they got millions and millions of church members but not a revival nowhere are you ready for this heavenly prophecy the bride not the church he said you know the bride hasn't had a revival yet who said so god said so not it not having you ever known yet yet meat is still coming yet meat is honest with you that means somebody gonna be responsible for this prophecy to come alive oh hallelujah watch it there have been no revival there no manifestation notice he didn't say no revelation because we've been hearing that for 40 plus years and i won't say how weary but i have a passion to see this come alive there have been no manifestation of god to steal the bride yet we are looking for it are you don't look at me no we you and i and i know what you have to do but do you know what you have to do i am doing what i have to do but are you doing what you have to do oh it's rocking inside of here it is shaking inside of here it's going to be rough it's going to be rocking but together we're going to make it by the grace of god here we go are looking for how we gonna come it will take the minister's association together together no it will take conventions and conventions no it will take those seven thunders [Applause] seven thunders to weak to revive to quicken to make money manifest seven thunders seven voices seven manifestation it will take something praise god amen you better say emmanuel [Applause] because two injuries out of here the word angel is sleepy angel if they say amen praise god hallelujah the anointing comes upon you he comes down in the worship and the pray if he said nothing sleepy anger will get you i hear bring some extra breeze to make sure you're back down soothing inside the church sometimes even even thinking you're awake sometimes you're thinking the goodness is the subconscious it by personally conscious mind [Applause] not to fight that demon because it's a demon god don't have sleepy angels see i can't have them send them to sleep sleep please didn't you sleep last night sleep please in church you have two hours to be awake we're not keeping your ten hours devil bombardier all the week long this is a space of half an hour a space of grace a space of power a space of anointing a space to be anointed a space to be inspired to face the hopes of hell for the rest of the week don't waste your time here don't waste your time here do something action is caused [Applause] god didn't send me to build a church god sent us to build a revival glory glory oh glory fire in the building fire in the house power in the building power your nose glory glory you may be seated now watch this it will take those seven unknown turners to wake her up again he will send it no man have to bring it he will send it we had revelation no we expecting a manifestation glory glory glory you may be seated look at this you may be seated jesus prophecy sign of his crucifixion peter fight him jesus will do the devil on him he could probably sign the son of man would be crucified he know he have to pay the price you have to pay the price to get the book because your name is in the book if you name it if he doesn't get the book you can't release your name that you could pawn into manifestation because the book has your complete redemption both soul spirit and body the mystery of which is locked up in that book ah glory man no feeling to preach glory to god demands complete redemption and restoration was sealed in the book so the lamb had to take the book to break the seals to reveal that we could go back to know who we are who god is and who the devil is [Applause] oh glory he will send it so when jesus rose from the dead better rebuke the disciples after three and a half years of following him peter went back fishing and a bunch of brothers zero revelation no understanding went fishing with him too this is a pizza you on your own you want to go fishing you grow the boat you talk to you send out the la or you do everything yourself we're not going out there they could have told him that but if i go fishing they say we going to but notice jesus behavior he said oh god well you know that no no no do you have any meat is there any fish all night god nothing yeah because you're out of the will i want you all to really have nothing to get but i'm going to release my will cast your net on the right side i'm not here with you let me bring something to you [Applause] they were out on the shore and the sea looking for fish and there's no fish notice if they were in the boat on the land he couldn't tell him casting it to the right side you'll get son so even though they were out of the program he actually allow and make all things work you can't get fish on the land because fish doesn't grow on the land it doesn't swim on the land you have to be on the sea accent is caused they went out there doing something they caught nothing until the master's voice funded on which side to cast the net and the master's voice has thundered casted on the right side go on the wrong side be going on the right side yeah we have a big catch coming oh glory to god give the lord a shout people hallelujah glory look here we go supporter man drop that promise and now he's gonna drop process to the promise process yeah just drop the promise how you're connecting to it how you get into it how it's going to be unfolded he said if the churches would forget their creeds today in all the churches oh glory to god did you hear that if all the churches would forget their creeds forget their dogmas and just take the bible and plead the promise it would become effective to them hear what you're pleasing you're not pleading about yourself you're feeling what god promised lord you promised the holy ghost you promise revival you promise deliverance you promise healing you tell joel in the last days you poured your spirit i understand my revelation you were waiting for the mechanics to comfort and with the seven seas being open the mechanics has been revealed now we are here [Applause] go watch no you can't say you don't know because god prophet was evidence of the land that we are going to [Music] you could still put on deep cold until deep and see the holy spirit the pit of fire operate through that prophet to discern conditions and people you could still read the books to see how much your supernatural was manifested in this age and he said what you see manifested temporarily will be manifested in its fullness when the press comes people feel is just coming to church normal but the press is coming and you have to have what it takes to deal with the press [Applause] isis they're calling christians the crusaders they're going back into the war that was hundreds of years you know what happened in here the spirits that was back here has returned the spirits don't die they just transfer from generation to generation so it have to have sodom on the earth and if it have sodom it have to have the bride on the earth also the elect like abraham to hear elohim coming in the cool of the evening walking to abraham to reveal to abraham what he's about to do should have to have the holy spirit beginning to unveil god by the word to you to make the vision plain that you can't sit no more you can begin to run brother from influence familiar quote brother branham what we have seen his promises in the last days or to put each one of us in action what we have seen should put every soul in action it should make a church it should make a church let me emphasize that this vision what we have seen you have to see it if you see me go you can have it what you have seen should make a church that will make a revival he say here in phoenix that people will be flying from europe to see what's taking place they will say there in arizona call it maricopa valley a city coffee you know somebody go an open church in maricopa valley in arizona and read this that is nothing he's only seeing what they should say so you can't go and say you know what let's open my church in maricopa valley in phoenix call it a maricopa valley phoenix church as spoken by malachi 4 that whole thing in the name of the church that means nothing you follow i'm saying god not interested in tongue and talk god interested in people moving into reality people hungry that's why i love david david's as a heart plant after the water broke so my mouth is after god no so my soul that i had a heart business dave god called david a man after my own heart that's why god love when you're honest when you're open when you're free when you're trying to think twice they say lord i'm a skull of riyama cheetah who are you jacob that's who i am good you know i know who you are you know who you are i can change you [Applause] i'm not hearing the shouting account [Applause] i've never seen for any condition god opens i beg and see that condition sober i've never seen any scripture even when the blind bartimaeus came god asked him what shall you do you want me to do for you and the man blind everybody know you're blind jesus know you're blind but he wanted to hear from batman's mouth what if but attitude yes you are blind jesus had to walk away you know because you can't nothing can flow in that kind of attitude you understand i'm saying everybody know it's a blind man but jesus has come so different that's why i love him he don't come he has come different to people's expectations he watch a blind man and say what do you want me to do he said open my eyes oh glory what do you want him to do we want a revival you have to have to speak it that you have to see it action is caused the man centurion came to jesus he said i recognize what you are i recognize you under authority you are power you see the one going to god you say i also mind in authority i just tell one go and go he said just speak the word and my servant gonna be here just speak just speak just speak i know your power to do it mine and jesus spoke and the man on his way said what time here is the man's sake check the doctor check the temperature what time was he healed he was so convinced that word went ahead of him [Applause] this word is faster than the doctor's knife glory glory glory hallelujah listen if a car coming to you to kill you that's what the truck comes in you on the car [Applause] [Music] you step down over jesus [Applause] you want me to give you a word when the barriers have no weapon formed the devil trying all kind of thing this weapon curved weapon anchor weapon all kind of weapon you don't have to attack you try your shoulder work this is so yeah we'll make something new no weapon form against you shall prosper glory amen isaac hallelujah not even prison could stop it no trial could stop it hallelujah samson prayed once more lord oh hallelujah glory hallelujah not a shame of the gospel not a shame of the son of man nor his words oh glory hallelujah what we see we shall say there is something broke out here until the seven thunders of revelation 10 that's not even wrong is being made manifested the power of god the end time is here the angel has gathered up the loose hands and we are here the loose ends have already gathered up we have no more loose hands we have nothing to tie up we have to get ripened and then said father let the fire fall knew he was right fellows come to him church members everything that one seemed dear to him turn against him he's been accused of a secret sinner but god was duty-bound to keep his promise to him and we see this great man remember job had no bible to read in his day reading wasn't as important as hearing he had the ability as all sons and daughters i i just love that all sons and daughters the catholic church took back the word from the people that they need a priest to expound to them but we find out by a prophet that god has built in the sons and daughters of god the ability to hear from god [Music] [Applause] in other words i could bring a false anointed in this pulpit and he could preach lovely words to you and without i saying a word the clock or the the thing inside of you what's it yes yeah no no and somebody said people preach it and the preacher only reached it on top of the head over there it didn't come in at all because they can't receive it so just over it's hanging it's hanging why because god protects you by the seed in you the elect will not be deceived all all on the earth will be deceived [Music] except accept those names written [Applause] i'm not afraid to preach the gospel to the names that are written we're not looking for church members we're looking for the bride oh hallelujah hallelujah no let's go he was a prophet to whom the word of lord come to and he only had to get be inspired here we go because he knowed his position that he was god's prophet he knew who he was nobody could change that but he needed inspiration samson knew who he was to but the spirit came upon him and he did this he did that his strength was in god and these guys knew it without him they're nothing here we go that's what the church if it's in order set in order it's got the mechanics ready are you ready everybody alive sleepy spirit gone that's not hundred percent sleepy spread gone good i want to know it's long gone sleepy spirits telling me the spirits they kicked me out of the head sometime this morning i was getting comfortable among the young people but they kicked me out hallelujah looked like fire began to move on pewter pew you kicked me out i don't know what's happening among those people but they're squeezing me out fire moving brother the brother sister pewter it's fire seem to be jumping all over it look like they're ready to make a revival and look like they're going to cause something to happen it look like they are part of the shaker all right so got the mechanics ready it only needs the dynamics tonight if we'll get the mechanics ready are you ready get our house right the things that we can do follow every word form in baptism follow him in every order he told us get every mechanic ready and stand there so stop brother with it let's talk about our responsibility god have a responsibility and we have a responsibility and what we identifying is god our responsibility and let's see what god responsibility is so our responsibility is to get our hearts right follow every word follow every order get the mechanic ready and stand there listen and stand there is this the word then we are ready for dynamics to be lit off here we go and only god can do that [Applause] i want a bigger amen than that because if you don't believe that a man has to do that and we have to find that man because we need it bad all right here in trinidad only god can do that so when jesus raised from the dead opened the world to his disciples openly understanding the scriptures it was revealed to them dear promise he prayed them receiving the holy ghost when they went in the upper room that wait because only god can do that the bible said when the day of pentecost which was the appointed time brother anthony when the day of pentecost was fully come they were in one place they were in one man and they were in one accord watch those ones because there's only one lord there's only one faith there's only one baptism watch those ones when prophet was told are you looking at the picture the right way the seven angels have to turn to the right and you're seeing one christ one lord one faith one baptism another ephesians oh give the lord some praises people then we are ready for the dynamics only god can do that and that's to drop into your heart the fader say i am not healed and it doesn't make any difference you'll heal anyhow all glory to god amen hallelujah isn't that right he is the dynamics we become members of the machine of his body forming ourselves into this world image you don't have to know the mechanics just the dynamics that's why i know the bride is about to be called more of the bride going to be called some in some being called why do you comparable at the 11th hour you see some men idle you say why is the idol action is caused if you're still there you have nothing to get come and work for me in the vineyard and you'll get pee there's only one more hour to go one more push come push with me one more press come press with me hallelujah come on in the fields with me and when player time come you give the first the the last first the last penny penny penny next one penny and those who were long in the vineyard tired and weary taught again a penny and a half per entry quarter two penny double penny four penny they get the same penny and gold is bringing a revelation saying penny what peter half you're gonna have what paul had you're gonna have what aunt you have you're gonna have we're gonna have at the same time the man who just come in same period shame power same signs same wonders same miracles same anointing nobody could hold back your blessing nobody could rob you and cheat you of your inheritance now therefore give me my mountain oh give the lord some praises oh hallelujah you're a great audience you'll be seated the dynamics is the holy spirit he is the dynamics of the mechanics the mechanics of the church what is it apostles prophets teachers he is the dynamic that works that so when the possible and the prophet and the teachers and the pastors come into position the dynamics come to work that the fire oh glory ah oh we're getting through but i'm turning the light i've already get to where i want to reach it but i'm going i'm going fast as i can just remind me of a fellow in florida he was talking he had a chevrolet car went out of him in florida took to the garage this mechanic was going along there sat together he couldn't get it to stop he put everything in it he renew all different things but something like that just wouldn't work couldn't get it started he kept trying trying little mechanic was nervous running around picking up this the man standing there saying i'm waiting on my car i'm late can't you get it he said i'm doing what i can really nervous directly a well-dressed gentleman walked up looked at him in a few moments he said to the mechanic after he get the butt his head around a little bit he said why don't you just touch this you're not getting any current he said i never told you that he just turned the other thing and the car started he turned around and said who are you you know who he was the chief engineer of general moto he made the thing and he designed it and in this hour what's the matter with all revival what's the matter we got the material we cut the mechanics but where is the dynamics that's what we need god designed it [Applause] watch what's the matter i will tell you there is one here today called the holy ghost who can touch the mechanics he is the dynamics of the mechanics it's the word it's the word turned on the light turns on the mechanics and they became dynamics they are dynamics and when the dynamics from the mechanics it started rolling so if we have to get the thing rolling we have to get started and i am i want somebody to answer who is responsible for getting this seven thunder revival oh glory to god listen to brother man says this is time he was pressed vision broke he knew something about the breakthrough listen to his words it might be closer than you think it's got me scared i haven't done enough where are we at when it's struck by the branham he says i haven't done enough what have you done for the kingdom when last have you done anything at all for god's kingdom you do for yourself but what about the kingdom you do for your children but what about the kingdom you do for your little family but what about the kingdom god have a little family business he has a big family oh glory to god he let the jews turned on christ and in them turning on christ he came to the gentile he's getting a gentile bride of people out of different nations of different tongues oh what a labor of love seven ages to get this wonderful beautiful wife oh hallelujah glory to god oh i can't see jesus letting the devil mess with his bride he waited too long for her he want to say i do he want to walk up the eyes with his bride he want to take flesh of his flesh bone of his bone word of his word spirit of his spirit life of his life he is longing to connect with you oh hallelujah hallelujah you watch he says time shall be no more he announces that time is over what happens could that be so brethren seriously think then the perimeter is kept by the seven thunders yes wow my pyramid camp by the seven thunders thunders the holy spirit coming to cap the pyramid of your lives amen yes three bibles the zodiac the pyramids and this bible take the peace bible put in the pyramid now we find out the pyramid is in us who could have taught that a pyramid we have a pyramid are we missing the cap the cap is the holy spirit that come to seal the whole thing enoch mechanic became dynamic by the spirit and god took him enoch walk with god walking with mechanics walking by faith believe in god all of a sudden he just walk of the earth because his mechanics turn into dynamics and god is saying the word in you which is the kingdom in word form will turn into power and you're going to get power power on the inside star track missile benevole had power on the inside daniel had hidden power he called hidden power come out when you need it you know what jesus wasn't manufacturing bread and say hey everybody every day forget the bakery come by me i'm the bread multiplying the fish multiplier it wasn't that the hungry he'd take five loaves two fishes and feed them first called five thousand next called seven thousand say only and come to your world all come for bread but only come and you're glad you're getting word hallelujah that's jesus we're talking about oh hallelujah just want them to come to hear words from his father all that the father give me i will give you i don't speak of myself i speak for my father give me the words to say unto you and as my father sent me so i'm going to send you and whoever i said my father said oh hallelujah that's jesus oh glory to god take some fishermen take some uneducated men and anoint them and send them out and said bring my word my deeds through their word make them kingdom men proving the wisdom of the wise to be fully and foolish all the doctorate and all the education to be not counted as not take uneducated men and bring gospel manifestation peter going to the place called beautiful and i see this crippled man says silvan go have i none what you have peter the man won silver and gold because nobody had no power before and he could do it himself and go because silver and gold could buy you things in case you didn't know lots of things but they can't make you walk but such as i have i possess something you can't see it you can't smell it you can't taste it but but i have it it's inside of me it's healed in me and i want to unseal it unveil it unfold it manifest it show it declare it notice peter never said will you be made whole jesus said that so peter going on a different level he said rise up and walk and peter you know what i mean here waiting you know he doing something raise the man up because he know his power power not out of him but in him power to release power to heal power to deliver we talk about genuine power we're not talking about temporary power we talk about permanent power resident power adoption power spoken with power third full power [Applause] i say this me to you all the ministers that holding god's elect that is not ordained of god to do so when the power come and the elect touch that spirit they like flying out there will be another exodus not the third one there's the one before the third one this is it two and a half that two exodus this is two and half exodus is the exodus before the exodus because he said when the power of this church rises [Applause] not power of revelation not teaching power not ministerial power they had it for 40 years please we can't take for the warriors of that no no when the power of this church rises we talk about holy ghost power [Applause] genuine power oh hallelujah hallelujah praise god i think in france we talk about the the plane we talk about here already brother branham was going to a plane and a horseman tell him walked down the street walking on that street and so on met a woman out there waiting listen looking for a prophet good morning person is a black area he's a white man he's walking down the street good morning person oh you know my person he said i was there my son is sick and i take god i'm your shoulder might where's your elijah and god told me to wait here i will send you elijah and she is waiting outside not inside saying oh god no god say go outside when she outside she causing something she's doing something she's waiting for elijah and if god tell her that god have to do something on that side and cause something on that side action is caused you can't sit and do nothing they have to cause you something you maybe see that then you know what happened he prayed he was healed what was he when he went back there it because final call he said god caused the plane to stop to remain something was wrong until the prophet was ready go on not to fix things god was shut down the equipment that said just break right there i'm a man of god that have to step on board you're not leaving on time you're leaving on my time when he is ready when he comes back then you'll be ready the angel of the lord is on the earth fixing things are wrong for the coming of the lord [Applause] time shall be no more you announces that time is over then if it is the pyramid is capped by seven thunders you remember the primary message is the capstone what did it do the holy spirit kept off the individual when you add to your faith and godliness and so forth he captured him and seen him with the holy spirit if that be so he's got seven churches he has had seven mysteries he if you cap you have this in you seven mysteries that they fought for to bring back and the heads don't come the cap of the church does the thunders mean that my brethren oh hallelujah this is brother branham and i believe everybody of it should be true every divine promise is a seed that will produce exactly what it said it would do if you take the right mental attitude towards it remember this the right mental attitude towards any divine promise of god will bring it to pass could you take a little more we are charging the battery today this is a special service here we go if you have the right mental attitude towards any divine promise of god will bring it to pass try it no try it just go do it if you got enough behind you to push you and say i can do it and by god grace i will do it then god is with you if you just wishy washy well i'll go up and see if they can do anything for me no i'm still reading here not long ago i'll just skip that oh praise god oh harlow so you don't want that lackadaisical attitude now let's go from from a man running from the presence of the lord brother branham he was saying dear jesus help us tonight and they say words as we wait upon you lord as we pray that your grace and mercy with us lord and tend our hearts move back all the shocks the torns the tissues let the blessed sunshine of god falling upon the word lord and may we have such a great meeting here that there may not be an unsafe person among us all the children will be in the kingdom of god those without the baptism of the spirit may they receive it further here we go may all the great mysteries that we are supposed to know at this age lord be unveiled to us here we go that we might see the plainness of god so that we will know how to behave ourselves and act correcting ourselves and bringing the members of our body into discipline of the world that we might know how to live in this present day at the approach of the lord jesus so the mysteries is to reveal to us the plainness of god that we might know how to behave isn't that right nobody used the scripture we read about jonah to identify a man running from the presence of god and he was speaking about responsibility and he said we find an example every one of us we are all running from something we run from trouble we went from responsibilities we are prone to do that we are more prone to run than to stand up and face it at all we find ourselves running sometimes we find ourselves prone to run from work we don't want to work some people think they can make a living without working but i think solomon said that we should find an answer and watching an ant you're not an aunt that doesn't work doesn't eat in winter either so everybody has to work whether you see him in or not we still going forward we got so many things we have to do are you with me when you're home stretched now this is this is the meat part now all right that was the steak part does he meat that was a salad we had yet we're going somewhat okay watch um we got so many things we have to do so much responsibility that we have to face everybody has got to face a certain responsibility everything is a responsibility and it's so easy when the responsibility faces us to shrug away from them we find marriage is a responsibility in all manners ministers many times took responsibility from standing for the true word of god when they're confronted with it they shook that responsibility when the truth of the word of god is brought face-to-face with them we as human beings should back but to face up the responsibility it takes the height of us as the father to give each other a weapon and so forth but even as i said ministers they come face to face with truth and then walk away from it they seem like they don't want to face up to it many times i have people come and say i know that's right brother branham but if i did that they would kick me out of the church what of it if you don't you will be kicked up up there so you've got to be kicked out somewhere you might as well face up to it jesus said the scriptures the idea testify upon me about me many people are afraid to face up the responsibility of coping with the message of the hour we find that everywhere many people here we go sympathize with it and say it's right but that is not the thing you're responsible for nice service nice people nice anointing nice inspiration you sympathize with it that is not what you respond before sympathy is not responsibility if a young man looking for a wife to be married stood a girl met every qualification and he taught to make a woman morally she's a queen lovely find personality real christian and think to make her a good wife make a good wife no matter how much she says she's perfect she isn't mine until i accept her and the responsibility of her being my wife that's the same thing with the message you might say it's right i sympathize i believe it's the truth but you've got to accept it it's got to become a part of you and you are part of it and then it is yours become like in this church if you see your memories church you have to be a part of it it's a part of you and then it's your church then you will be concerned with what goes on in your church you can't just walk in and walk out and if you're unconcerned what the no you'll be concerned so if somebody is off and wrong and whatever it is you'll be concerned enough to go and have a burden to pray with them encourage them provoke them to love unto good works to get back on track you'll be concerned to pull them up if somebody gossip until then stop it expose the gossip and spirit and let it leave them that is your responsibility isn't that right so whatever i'm talking about uh uh jonah went down to the hall of the ship i'm almost finished and took a wind and sleep took the easy route it's the easy way it's a popular way with the people it's easy to take the way where everybody can pack you on the back back and say you're a good fellow and the world look upon you it's easy to go the popular way but when you have to do something different when you have to stand for your conviction of what you know to be the truth that is where the hard part comes that's what the bible said take the book eat the book sweeten them out bit in the belly when you have the guts to stand for your conviction so we find out that we have many easy ways to go ships going to tashas for it's easy i know there's not a correct word the unresponsibilities it just flows in you have everybody likes you nobody disagree with you you disagree with nobody if that isn't a disrupt we have someone that is out here oh yes that's right just a push over flop over anybody i don't care who you are what you're standing for actually decent thinking people will think more of you if you stand for the conviction of what is right you take a woman she might not be attractive but she stands for what is right she'll get that respect and so forth and there's too many christians today so saw soup and everything else till they will just join church put their name on the book and call it christianity here we go christianity is an everyday rugged life living for god in this present world it's a constant burning of the fire and the love of god in the heart that sets you a fire and puts you yonder with the people making converts to christ it's a responsibility if your sister on the job wherever and your dress is correct and proper people will ask you why you dress the way you dress if people don't ask you that you just like them so then you have no testimony god wants to force the issue if when you sit down your dress can't cover your knee it's not long enough when you sit down you're just supposed to be able to cover your knee and that is modesty so when somebody see you dressing different they could ask who are you just like that and that makes you evangelist immediately that makes you a witness that gives you an opportunity to give your testimony you know why i dress like this because god sent a 20th century prophet that brought the direct word of the lord and this is what we believe and this is what we stand for and you give an opportunity to share your testimony pre-press i want to shake up your little world to ask if you are rugged and gutsy to stand for christ to reflect this beautiful wonderful gospel of the kingdom anybody could knee cut anybody could cut the hair and look dandy and sprite in whatever it is that's fine but you know what it's temporary our young men inside looking handsome and strong and defending temporary you know put 50 years on your youth you're still behind someone strong but not as handsome as strong as you are now i don't want to rough i don't want to disturb anybody who over 50 and hunt someone strong i don't want to disturb anybody whatsoever i just want to preach the word oh hallelujah is that some people not here not here did he get a greater die back so do him look all again be forever young oh hallelujah nothing wrong with

works no prayer no testimony nothing like that you have to be burning for god every day somebody is born every day i have young people 13 14 i need a testimony of this message i was 17 when the word came to me oh hallelujah you must testify to somebody about the glorious hope of the gospel let them turn it down but don't you fail to give your testimony glory to god but branham said we don't want the popular idea we want the truth we don't want to face up to nothing but what god said as the truth oh blessed being of the lord hallelujah listen to this jonah didn't want to go it was a responsibility he choose the easy way but nobody else could do it but jonah and when god here we go tells you something you have got to do it nobody else we have got to face up to do it what did the bible tells us in hebrews you didn't really get to strike it i'll close with this oh praise the name of the lord the song leader get ready to come hallelujah let us hold fast the professional faith without wavering he is faithful that promise amen it's a bothersome thing when people are not satisfied they say is better a man a man solomon say better live on the roof than a nagging wife because i bother something the nagging like a drip nagging nagging nagging and when somebody's not satisfied they're complaining whiny no joy in the testimony complaining complaining complaining ask yourself what you can do in your situation why not praise worship be content do something different because brother branham says complain and weakens your faith so god don't want to complain in people he called it to be a peculiar people if your road is rough that's your road walk on it [Applause] if your road is tough that's your road walk on it don't let the devil treat you that's not your road at the end of the road is where god wants you to be hallelujah listen let us consider one another that's a nice one you want to be kind you want to be helpful you want to put your brother first some

end of story but when you begin to extend yourself and see a bigger picture to consider one another how is this brother going how is this sister going and one word one call one text one tweet one email one encouragement one word one word just one word all i need one word one hallelujah oh my i feel good i wanna close but something is moving i have a good audience the other day good to be here watch provoke on the love and the good works some people like provocation who like provocation but provoke onto a purpose does some people like to provoke make jokes and carry on but encourage people to good works not forsaken the assembling ourselves together as the manner of some is today where home now becomes the option because they could hear it on the internet or whatever but exhorting one another so much the more as we see the day approaching so as the day approaching there shouldn't be less fellowship it should be more it shouldn't be less coming to church it should be more because god will bring present tense word that is why we try to yield ourselves to the spirit to find out what is god's mind for the all what is our responsibility and you can accept it and then do something about it not forsaking ourselves just as someone together as the man or some is but exhorting one another even as the day approaches may the lord bless you god bless you oh hallelujah [Applause] but this is my burden today to provoke one another under love and good words friends everyday the devil battling people people shouting today and tomorrow they're never slapping them up and they come in
