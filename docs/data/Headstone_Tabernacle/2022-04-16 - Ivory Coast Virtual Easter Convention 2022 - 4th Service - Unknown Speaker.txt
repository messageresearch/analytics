bless you greetings in the name of our lord jesus christ to where paul and the saints from pastor albert greene of bethlehem tabernacle trinidad and tobago i do give thanks to our lord for this opportunity through precious brotherhood to bring greetings to your virtual easter convention the team the life of christ in you is the vindication of the rapture precious brother paul plays for us in the invitation numerous scriptures and quotations from god's prophet giving a great insight to the team the life of christ the vindication of the rapture vindication speaks of proof that someone or something is right in the message you must be born again god's prophet tells us when you are born again god vindicates you that's how god vindicates all his media what by the fruits and that's the way he vindicates his ministry that's right all of his servants are vindicated the same way he vindicates nature how do you know it is a peach tree cause it brings peaches how do you know it is an apple tree bearing apples how do you know it is a christian a christian signs beer from it christian life comes out of it so church to vindicate it means to make plane to make manifest to verify our lord said i am the vine he are the branches so the vine can only produce what the life of the vine is the question how is a christian vindicated how is a christian known if christ lived in you the life of christ would be lived through you amen so if our lives are not vindicating what we are professing we have not got it think about that if our lives because if christ lived in you the life of christ will be lived through you if our lives whatever is your hour in your country it is night here with us but if our lives are not vindicating what we are professing then we can know without a shadow of a doubt we have not got it because the vine will only produce the life of the vine church the fruits of the tree vindicates the tree how do we know a christian a christian is vindicated by the life lived in the message is your life worthy of the gospel one of the quotations or precious brother paul used for these meetings a christian is not a tool or some kind of mechanical wrench to a great religious regime that's right a christian is not some kind of tool that keeps a religious organization moving a christian that is not a christian a christian is to be christ-like and a christian cannot be christ-like until christ comes into the man hallelujah a christian is to be christ-like so this christ-likeness of the christian it cannot come to pass until but christ comes into the man then it produces even the life that christ lived we are speaking about a vindication the life the theme of the meetings amen the life of jesus christ vindication of the rapture amen a christian cannot be a christian until christ comes to the man the life of christ in him then it produces the christ the life that christ lives hallelujah amen and you do the things that christ did oh glory and praise and honor be to almighty god amen so we message believers we are prone to speak in the light of the fact that the word has been revealed to us we all speak in glowing terms in glowing terms that the word the message we are under that inspiration of the word being revealed to us but you know in the message christ is the mystery of god revealed god's prophet asked this question how you know it's revealed amen so come on church this is not an hour of intellectual conception no no is not the time for intellectual ideas and in this intellectual age and all of us can talk about amen that we are inspired and the word is revealed to us but here we are told how to know it's revealed and how to know it's revealed is that it lives itself and expresses itself through you and god's prophet cried out oh so the word leaves itself the word expresses itself through you it's like faith without works is dead amen if we say it is revealed to us we got to know it is revealed and we are blessed through god's prophet to not only tells us or amen god used him to bring the word to us it shows us whether we are just having knowledge or if we get a revelation if it is revealed to us blessed be the name of the lord amen in the hebrews chapter 5 and 6 series god's prophet will tell us yay we all go to church amen we all we all go to church but there is some that has got life come on church we all go to church amen but everybody don't have life amen the ones that got the revelation of jesus christ in your heart those are the ones that got life amen so it's not by shaking not by jumping not by joining church but revelation god has revealed it to them and the doors who it has been revealed to to such a people by the grace of god such a people are the ones that has life oh blessed be the name of the lord so it is it is to us to know how it is we could identify it is revealed the call precious brethren is for the life amen the great message is that christ living his life in me just just i see like he lived it here on the earth our lord not i live in the life it's our lord living his own life in you and i that we just being vessels the life that he would live we are living it here by the grace of almighty god so in closing at my 10 minutes is about up and we pray god's richest blessings on his servants as they continue to expound on these teams through your meeting i want to close off with the quotation from god's gifts fine is appropriate places bless the lord hallelujah so god's prophet is telling us here that i would rather amen i would rather have the life of christ in me amen i would rather have the life of christ in me to live sweet to live victorious than all the gifts of healing the gift of prophecies and all them are the gifts just give me jesus let me live the life the life that's the life i want to live i want to live so that others will know that's my desire at christmas and i pray it is your desire that god will give us that desire to have the life of jesus christ god bless you god bless your meeting god bless your time together in jesus precious name amen and amen amen amen amen you appreciate that today blessed be his wonderful name

hallelujah hallelujah i just can't give up now [Music] [Music] will [Music] oh blessed be the name of the lord what a time what atmosphere praise the name of the lord praise god hallelujah god bless the saints god bless you brother pastor paul pastor paul in greetings his wife and church this easter convention ivory coast we certainly appreciate this invite to speak to the bride of jesus christ amen be so grateful to be here i thank the lord for the services that has gone before and the ones that will come after that god bless him will be upon them we have had a great time i will continue to be blessed as we feast around the word of god so at this time if you have your bibles i'd like you to turn to ezekiel chapter 37 warner verse one to ten sin john chapter one one to read from verse one to five and ten to fourteen praise god is a powerful team and inspiration but paul has listed here the team being the life of christ in you is the vindication of the rapture and an inspiration of the revelation by the life of christ i love that inspiration the revelation by the life of christ amen praise god so reading from ezekiel chapter 37 the hand of the lord was upon me and carried me out in the spirit of the lord and set me down in the midst of the valley which was full of bones and caused me to pass by them round about and behold there were very many and in the open valley and lord they were very dry and he said unto me son of man can these bones live and i answered oh lord don't know us and again he said unto me prophesy upon these bones and certainly dry bones hear the word of the lord thus saith the lord god unto these bones behold i will cause bread to enter into you and he shall live i would lay sinews upon you and will bring up flesh upon you and cover you with skin and put bread in you and he shall live and ye shall know that i am the lord so i prophesied as i was commanded and as i prophesied there was a noise and behold a shaken and the bones come together bone to his bone and when i beheld the sinews and the flesh came upon them and the skin covered them above and there was no breath in them then he said unto me prophesy unto the wind prophesy son of man say to the wind thus here the lord god come from the four winds of bread and breathe upon thee slain that they may live so i prophesied as he commanded me and the bread came into them and they lived and stood upon their feet an exceeding great army i read from john chapter one and the beginning was the word the word was with god and the word was god the same was in the beginning with god all things were made by him and without him was not anything mean that was made in him was life and the life was the light of men in him was life and life the light of men and the light shines in the darkness and the darkness comprehended it not we go down to verse 10 he was in the world and the world was made by him and the world knew him not he came unto his own his own receive him not but as many as receive him to them give me power to become the sons of god even to them we have believed on his name which were born not of blood nor of the will of the flesh nor of the will of man but of god and the word was made flesh and dwelt among us i will beheld his glory the glory of his only begotten father full of grace and truth let's bow our heads heavenly father we thank you for your word this morning we thank you for this time this easter time father god and jesus speaks up for our true gender resurrection and we pray you will come down in your word and speak to your people confirm your word with signs wonders and miracles i with your pawn of your spirit upon the lives and hearts of your children in jesus name i ask it amen and amen you may be seated praise the name of the lord it's good to be here in god's presence and to have fellowship around the world with believers of light precious feet praise god thank you again brother paul pastor paul for this invite to speak amen i have a title this morning can these dry bones live and as you hear this you can look up on your life look upon situation looks so challenging and difficult and ask yourself if you could really get a breakthrough can these bones live now we're talking about bones we're not talking about somebody standing upright we talking about bones hallelujah just bones just bones just bones and god told that man come down to the valley of dry bones it's not just bones like they have something substance in it it's dry he said but can these bones live can these bones live can these bones live have a subject life a life coming into the body and have an inspiration supernatural strength to change these bodies we live in oh praise god that's what the bride will need that's what we will need we will need what a supernatural strength to change these bodies that we live in praise god but the question and i'm asking that that's my title praise god can these dry bones live pray because somebody's going to answer that we know what the bible declared but somebody going to answer that can these dry bones live o praise the name of the lord and when that mighty angel came down in revelation 10 with the book open and john was told to eat the book and almost prophesy again so the bride will get the testimony of jesus which is the spirit of prophecy to prophesy from the book we cannot prophesy what not in the book praise god because the angel brought a book a book that was sealed so in that book have the bride's prophecy in that book of your family deliverance in that book of your adoption your perfection the rapture the resurrection all those things are already in the book we don't need another man we don't need another fightful man prophet man messenger man apostle man no kind of man god sent one elijah to turn our hearts back to the faith of the fathers after he sent that elijah he sent the mighty angel the one with the sweat back wings the one with the seventh shield the one with the open book and seven thunder story voices out to god our bride together oh glory to god hallelujah give the bright faith glory to god a bunch of bones praise god because when this prophecy began to roll he said i hear noise no noise no god you have to hear a noise once that prophecy starts to be active you are born in this bride praise god praise god praise god there is going to be a noise a rumbling in the camp born come to bone the knee bone come to the hip bone the ankle bone come to the oh glory to god born come to bone backbone neck bone bone come to porn or give the lord a shout there is going to be a gathering of the bride of jesus christ nothing going to stop it there's a prophecy hanging over this pride oh glory to god you can miss it if you try oh hallelujah praise god so we stand here this morning to prophesy over your life whoa we don't look at your hard faces we don't look at your feelings we don't look at your emotions we look at what god has said and if god said it it got to come to pass in the beginning there was gross darkness covered here god's darkness was everywhere but god said let there be light oh glory to god i want to see light you're going to see life oh glory to god give the lord a shout once you see light you'll have to see life oh hallelujah give the lord some praises in him was light hallelujah and the light was the life of men in him was life and the life was the light of men so once life come light come no life here in darkness oh give the lord a praise give the lord our praise no life you're in darkness oh blessed be the name of the lord may be seated and brahman was praying to pray here he said gracious heavenly father we are so fond of your holy word till our hearts just burn within us when we know that your spirit comes down in the midst of us and there speaks to us and our hearts reach out and take hold of it we just seem so feel so good over it lord and to know that in this dark hour there's so much confusion like the prophet said in the last days there will come a famine something of this order not for bread and water but for the hearing of the true word of god for men will travel from the east to the west north and south seeking to find the true word of god what is the word jesus is the word the word was made flesh and breath among us then he injected us here to see the manifestation of the real word of god made manifest according to scriptures oh glory to god you heard that you see how we come and switch from the world to see the real manifestation of the real word of god made manny says according to scriptures and brought to pass that how people would travel and seek and would fail to find oh god we are so glad so glad we have found him years ago precious to our heart so that we are not one bit confused oh god you said they that know their god shall do exploits in that day and here we are in the last days oh glory to god doing what sitting down in church we can't do that we are here to greatly do exploits very signs and wonders and miracles performed doing it just the way he did it oh glory to god lord let us by the holy spirit reach out in that word and get those real things and tie them to calvary by the worm and see in him we have the fullness and riches and the blessing and the glory and all goes to him who is worthy to come and take the book at the right hand of him that sat on the throne oh my he was slain from the foundation of the world oh man father i pray that we let us get into the enemy's lines out yonder and conquer every precious soul that's waiting and bring them out of darkness into the light for we ask it in jesus name oh praise god what a prayer this morning oh glory to god hallelujah and zechariah prophesied that it will come a day that cannot be called day or night a dismal day just teaching teaching on word word no manifestation no light because the word manifested is light when you see it oh glory to god but in the evening time it's shall be light hallelujah praise god isn't that right he said in the evening time it shall be like what is that gospel light what does it do holy spirit what does it do ripen the crop in the last days the holy spirit will pour out in time that is thus said the lord no man can stop it god remove mountains god will move prime ministers presidents turn the world upside down but the holy spirit going to pour out in the last days to ripen the seed [Applause] glory the god amen listen in the last days the holy spirit will pour in time in the last days to bring in the latter rain the real rain but first

to change and transform us not just talk and fellowship in and talk and talk and talk shut up no more talk you need supernatural strength supernatural power and no man have that that comes from god all glory to god when they were in the upper room suddenly praised god they were in one mind one accord and suddenly there was a wind a russian mighty wind that come down from heaven no five full minutes that was bringing that no pastor man and bishop man and an evangelist man no man was bringing that that was the lord himself descended upon them and they were staggering like drunk men oh glory to god they couldn't keep up straight mary was walking praise god like how drunk people let's walk oh glory to god it was staggering hallelujah they were so staggering that the people on the outside said these men are drunk look at the time of the early day you don't drink so early and peter staggered and said these men are not drunk as we suppose but this is that that the prophet william branham speak of oh give the lord a shout in the house that is what we're going to say oh give the lord a shout the bad corner of a revival a holy ghost revival a seven thunder revival oh my [Applause] that is what she's waiting for now here the bomb no other life will work in her you know this is their self-help books on self self have to do this to do that you can't self-help the status lighting because this bride have a what's it here a big a seven-cylinder i know we do have that seven-cylinder engine i never took wool that you joined his pocket to get it started sparking like a spark that can't start that engine it will take charity it will take l-o-v-e you have a lot of pressing to do because it will take the life no other life will work in her yet a bomb she can't come to life any other way yet she feeds it out there so that's why brother branham says a minister cannot bring a revival so why all these ministers parading the beef as if they could do so much with the people as if they love the people more than jesus is that the minister's wife is the lamb's wife he love us enough to send us the books send us a message to send us the word to send us the anointing that's god's love to us he loves enough this in our fight for ministry to echo what was in the books because the spirit the prophets and the bride will be saying the same thing what we preach here you supposed to go back and read back in your books when you press play at home you can supposedly hear about what we say in here that i am we are preaching this and preaching that we preaching the word glory to god that's what you want to get the word isn't that right no other life can work in her she can't come to life any other way yet she feeds it out there she knows it's going to happen and then it happens she wakes up oh hallelujah she know it going to happen a sense of faith in your soul know it's going to happen oh glory to god hallelujah glory to god let's continue praise god he says now watch he said now it is we don't believe in same hell praise god he says now oh mercy we need men of god men who won't hold back not everybody can't be a preacher but you've got a voice and if you can't preach the people of simon if you're a preacher you're called to the pulpit to preach if you're not you're still a preacher but live the people of sermon let your sermon be lived and it's the voice of god that will bring reproach to them who reject it oh you mean the word is the voice and the life is a voice you mean if you don't know what that seed is the contents of that seed all you have to do is to plant it and let the life unfold and the fruit will speak a voice of what that seed is so if it's a pumpkin seed you don't know if it's a watermelon or pumpkin seed you plant it because both run and vine both similar but when the light began to unfold flower fruit then you said this is a watermelon or this is a pumpkin now the only thing to identify it is the unfolding of the life so the seed is very important but then the life on the seed has to unfold well god put a bright seed and that bright seed is the bible that by seed is the pyramid add to your faith virtue and knowledge and temperance and patience and godliness and brotherly kindness and that life will unfold and identify the bride of jesus christ and second timothy 1 4 7 30 and minded will identify the church seed oh glory to god but we talk about bright sea this morning glory to god hallelujah don't try to preach it if you're not called to be a preacher you get mixed up and messed up get people tangled up praise god the preachers call the preachers and deliver true if they can't live it then stop preaching it but you're supposed to live your simmers it was voices then he said this here now how we need in justin's ville and we could say the bride around the world thousands of lived voices the thunder of god turning out no she's not talking about text exaltation preaching text and messages and preaching he's not talking about that live voice the thunder of god turning out in sweetness holiness purity undefined lives walking around the earth today without a blemish real questions that's the thunder against the enemy then he drills down deeper the devil don't care how loud you holla the devil don't care how much you jump how much you can do this or shout but what hurts the devil is to see that sanctified holy life consecrated to god say anything to him call him anything just as sweet as it can be move right on that throws him away that's the thunder that shakes the devil you say well if he could preach like billy graham or about some great influential speaker no sometimes the devil just laughs at that he don't pay no budget no more attention that that nothing you get all the theology you want all the seminary training and the devil sit back and laugh at that but when he sees that life oh give the lord some praises [Applause] then he went on to talk about his disciples he said look at the disciples with a maniac child with epilepsy a disciple saying come out of him devil come on from the devil come on devil and the devil sitting there saying no aren't you making a pretty shame of yourselves you you see what you're doing jesus told you he commissioned you to cast me out and not one of you can do it but brother when they see him come one come walking quietly he didn't have to say nothing no words that devil was scared right then he know he had to leave without jesus saying a word so as jesus coming down the devil sat in the back up shop already getting all these things together he said he's living there long enough he's got to move up with his wares and his clothes all that he had and he he built up there like he resident there he's at the pack up shop because our life's coming no he getting ready to hear the word to leave he only reached into the voice he said get out oh give the lord some praises hallelujah praise god he know he had to leave cause here come a life not only a sermon but a life come out of him that done it quietly he knowed what he was talking about he knowed what he was doing isn't that something this life of jesus christ hallelujah praise god and the prophets are speaking about the spiritual mind down in egypt and see what the persecution rise see joseph take no way in order that persecution could rise and see god with his wheel moving around perfectly potiphar reject joseph the lie toll see joseph in prison his beard grown out excommunicated from his brethren and then all of a sudden god move in so it looked like god abandoned joseph but a prophecy hanging over him so when the brothers taught that jamming joseph and killing joseph and getting rid of joseph they're actually flinging him into his prophecy all the holla and crying loud grinders what about my brethren my brethren look good all of that joseph didn't understand goddess see god has played what i call the long game when you're looking at this week and this month god see him 10 years from now 15 years from now so god knew you were going to be here as part of the bright body on the earth in 2022. god knew you'd come to coronavirus come through all kind of atmospheres and so on and still have a love for him to save him god knows all about it god know that there will be no giving up in you so when you were back said no when you was in the world god was conquering you you could have boasted you see that child of mine that child coming through because child that child is a seed and every seed that i bring forth after is kind that is my seed and my son that is my seed and my daughter glory to god though devil to twist what is original hallelujah never gotta change the original seed hallelujah all of a sudden god move in now we can see the wheels moving god's great plan moving everything up to this exodus watch to this time when he would call his people back in the line again back in the place in position where he could bless them one two place among them the one he promised he would place among them they had to be in their land and remember they had to come out of the land that they were in and get into the terminology the land of promise before the promised messiah would ever come and the church has to do the same thing get out of that group of rejecters over into the promise before messiah can ever be manifested before them so you mean they have rejections in the message of course they have unbelievers in this message it have maybe given this message and it's absolutely business message in the message believe in gods and a prophet all are not believers make and true church has to do the same thing here it is and the church has to do the same thing get out of that group of rejecters over into the promise before messiah can never be manifested before them hear the bomb now the life of the messiah manifested making a church ready a bride oh my give the lord some praises on that one [Applause] i want to put up all inspiration the revelation by the lies you mean that this life of virtues have to be manifested not taught manifested to make a bride ready you see a woman marrying a man and disagreeing with him it would be fussed continually but when a man and his wife his girlfriend is exposed when they're in perfect harmony like one soul one mind because they're going to be one flesh then when the church can get in such harmony with god here we go until the manifestation of the bridegroom is manifested in the bride because they're going to be one so all the seals word message teachings revelation inspiration seeds is to bring a manifestation of the bridegroom in the bride vindicating that they are one that's the only way you could know hallelujah it has to be the same works same life hallelujah are you sure of that yes i am listen to what he said here we lift you luta's age wesley age all along to the ages pentecostal age and each age is given a promise of the word and the people of that age that manifest that promised word is the seed of that age not people that believe people that manifest the promise just as the promise of brotherly kindness is for this age that the brain has the blood upon a chest of brotherly love that has to be manifested that can't be explained away on top of very love no no it has to be manifested look how to be displayed somebody must cross your wrong somebody must lie on you somebody must bring offense to you and you have to say i forgive you oh glory to god you have to drop it wait when you stand praying for l-o-v-e you have to drop it you have to let it go somebody did you evil you have to give it away glory to god because you're going to a higher place you're looking for a supernatural strength to change your body if you have one horse you're not leaving here if you have one ought to go into the tribulation if you have one ought you're not going to make it you've got to be light you're going to be disconnected from odds and grudge and hurts and pains and what people do you and what they didn't do you know what they should have done you have to forget about it let it go glory to god you have to let your own sins go glory to god you have to forgive yourself too after god forgive you have you forgiven yourself or give the lord some praises hallelujah hallelujah oh glory and the people of that age that manifest the promised word is the seed of that age according to what jesus said right here they are the children of the kingdom he said that's right the manifestation of the holy spirit operating through his children is those seeds of the kingdom at that age oh my hallelujah oh glory to god the manifestation of the holy spirit operating in his children oh it's the seed of the age so god going to be identifying he's into their own seed oh glory to god remember you're another believer they believe that's the word in you come on now come on now don't just praise god the believer is the word in you you're not the believer god puts something in you to believe his own word glory to god you can tell satan how do you consider my saving job because he know what he put in job that can't come against god that can't curse god and what god put into you that understand oh glory to god i don't care what your flesh has done it go understand you will come forth you will come forth you will be delivered you will be free oh glory to god god gonna break the bands off for you break wickedness over you break evil oh for you glory to god hallelujah praise god praise god so the original grain of the bright church fellaini rome isn't that right and the life began to come out to luton wesley isn't that right the life that come out of the original seed came through different processes and then turned back to its original condition so the revelation of the seed is the revelation of the seven two changes the seven church ages what's really the unfolding of god's own seed through processes the life moving on producing stalk producing tassel producing husk then coming back to see it again it's the life doing that or give the lord a shout you are hearing words being preached but there's a life behind that it's the life of the word that is doing that oh give the lord some praises the life here we go that was in the husk in this talk and in the tassel all gathered up in the seed so all these seven seals all these mysteries all they got in the scattered word and tying it back in the word that's the life from all the shock and all that got in together to reveal every mystery and put it inside of you as a seed as a word so when the angel come he said the secret is the word is in the bride that's the secret oh my hallelujah notice the light that was in the stalk went to make another justification made away for sanctification signification made away from the battle of the holy ghost and the baptism of the holy ghost made a way for the holy ghost itself to come down in perfection and back to the word again oh glory the true word of life on it was on its way to the original grain through these stages through this talk and so on now watch hallelujah dare produce the early revival a holder of a certain portion of the seed life but when they organized the life moved out oh my as soon as they organize it they're going dead notice the life is traveling or now it is moving on that's why people like to go back into church history because they like dead so now they go back the history of when god was used to be with them what god used to do and how god did that 50 years ago 100 years ago and 30 years ago but they can't talk about what we're doing now the only talking now because your life move on you see the churches held a portion of life but as it pushing on and they die and you know why their life couldn't come back to revive them he says because they nominate and god can't go back in nomination actually they kick him out they boot him out with their creeds because god can only sit on the word once the word is dear he could sit on it hallelujah he could abide on it but once the word is removed he gone he is with his word anytime he have an interpretation on it he's gone he's gone glory to god hallelujah most people start off right and enough wrong it's not who run it's who finish the race oh glory to god is that him who starts you have to finish so the life leave the stalk oh no no i missed something here i did miss something here he said justification made a way for signification signification made away for the baptism of the holy ghost and the baptism of isaiah of the holy spirit couldn't mess this up and the baptism of the holy ghost made a way for the holy ghost itself to come down in perfection and back to the word so we're not talking about 1906 we don't want the baptism made away for the holy ghost itself so what the prophet introduced was the person of the holy ghost to come back again amongst the bride him moving in and out among us oh glory to god glory to god amen do you believe it so the life leaves the stalk to make the tassel from the tassel that makes the husk from the husk it goes into the original grain notice never again to be useful of him my my don't you see why he never used an organization he can't get back in it again it is dead the life passes on from one to the other they put crease and inject and whosoever shall add one word or take one without he is blocked off from it it must be the live sea traveling on so that's why the seven ages is like a history of the seed life god's own life passing through processes coming back at the end time back to original and that is what brother branham brought original seed so any man tamper with that is perverted it has to be what the tapes say that's why he says say what the tapes say because these are promises that is why you tell john eat the book not another book eat this book which book the open book hallelujah the one that the mighty angel brought don't eat that book and from that book you prophesy though must prophesy again and that's what we are doing we are prophesying of a revival we are prophesying of lattering we are prophesying of a resurrection power we are prophesying of a prize revival we are prophesying of a super church a super race adoption of sons we are prophesying that your family will be delivered we are prophesying that you're gonna be healed we are prophesying that you're gonna be set free we have to prophesy from the book or give the lord some praises that your condition now is not your condition in the future we are prophesying that you're going to get a breakthrough i know i could stop it oh glory to god hallelujah do you believe that hallelujah hallelujah glory to god amen let's continue the all we are living the ecclesiastes spirits uniting together now bringing them to one big slaughter to blot out it's already in writing here in this nation that these churches has to be closed unless you are with an organization it's a union it's a boycott just like the mark of the beast now do you see what this beast is don't you it's a power the beast is not paper torque the beast is the power to do things so the bride can have paper only if by that's have a power to do things is b's power versus bright power oh give the lord i shout who have the more power glory to god the beast of a power and the pride of our power he said you cherish the power after the holy ghost come upon you oh give the lord some praises hallelujah he came unto his own his own receive him not but as many as receive him the damn gave power to become the sons of god or give the lord a shout in the house not giving her power not backslide and power power to become the sons of god power to be changed shall be transformed hallelujah let's continue it's so close like the real thing did they see the very electric as possible but he promised to have something here for us in that day that we wouldn't be deceived and that's the word and christ make it manifest to us aha you hear oh he plays that he doesn't just say just the word you know and cries to make it manifest to us they are supernatural devils unseen to the eye but you can see what they are doing notice that this group is riding making themselves ready to stomp out everything that won't agree with them but there's another group being made ready in revelation 19 the next time the church is heard she comes not upon exactly horses he's on a white horse and with the horse and heaven was following up on white horses while this group down here has got 2000 bong at the river euphrates has been bombed for 2000 years also the church has bound the holy ghost the church has spun the holy oak for nearly two thousand years on the martyrdom back there under the church ages it's been born not at the real euphrates but at the door of queens and dogmas that the holy spirit can't work in the church because of man-made systems but she is going to be liberated that's the prophecy she's going to be liberated from man-made systems that the holy ghost would start to work in the church she's going to be liberated oh that's a prophecy the bride will be liberated god will bust them out from here possible from there they're going to be liberated hallelujah she is coming back that's what the bible said those two meet one another in the battleground lucifer and michael again like the beginning they have been bound for 2000 years almost 2000 years they heard the bomb now the holy spirit has been bombed by these international rivers for almost two thousand years but it's to be loosed in the evening time by the event time message oh oh oh you mean the holy spirit is to be loosed by the evil time message yes oh glory to god is loose today first he loose it with books and tapes but then he's going to lose it by spirit because the word and spirit is the same oh blessed being of the lord the holy spirit back again christ himself revealed in human flesh in the evening time he promised it there's three stages the matter age the stage of reformers are now recalling all time when finished at the loud reason asia conversion 10 the mystery of the bible remain known to the bride revelation 10 called out by the word christ himself calling out the bride not some man christ himself the lord himself descended with a shout seven thunders to get the bride threw them voices out to catch that lady that lady waiting for all these years a special lady a lady that will be anointed and commissioned a leader will be inspired a lady are going to represent a husband on the earth when you see her you see him oh glory to god she will be just like him because what he did she's going to do also but same works i do shall my lady do also oh glory to god everybody knows the true church is another book of acts the true church is mark 16 in action that's the true church manifested pride hallelujah praise god hold on to our bride make and plain hebrew stood in it that he's the same yes it is then forever he believes praise the name of the lord praise god so there have been churches brides churches but there's got to come one there's got to become a real bride there's got to come one not only as the mechanics but the dynamics of it to make the church live and move in the power of the resurrection oh you mean this is what god wants the church to do live and move and operate in the power of his resurrection oh glory to every service god confirmed in the word every service the bible said the lord himself went everywhere with them anywhere they're going to go into everywhere everywhere ever devil know not to touch that church oh god i suffered no man to do them wrong same touch not my anointed do my prophets no ham oh give the lord i shall the angel of the lord and camp [Music] around those that fear him then you know god is around you angels around you you are special unto god you are elected you are predestinated you are the full known the fallen oh give the lord some praises hallelujah thank you lord hallelujah glory to god watch until we come to that place until we get to that place what good does it do to polish the hubs what could it do to give a facelift if there's no dynamics in it you have a nice guy you're rubbing it down you're taking pictures by it but it can't start there's like an instagram car there's a picture a bicycle passing you and you you're a nice guy and a little boy that bicycle riding passing you and you stand up there because your car can't move when there's no dynamics in it no matter how much the mechanics prove to be right there's got to have a dynamics to make it work that's what he proved that's what easter proved he wasn't only the word but he was god himself the dynamics in the word so jesus said destroy this body and treat his idol rises up no you're saying i destroyed his body and tree i really like his mechanics but when he raised like dynamics hallelujah any man can talk he's talking you know but when jesus rushed from the dead he proved he wasn't just talking he was walking the dog he rose from the dead quickening power he went down with an alarm clock in him hallelujah when he said after three minutes he'll make a noise but he went on the grave with an alarm in him on the three days when jesus stated hit so glory to god earthquake rolled away the stone the man god in the tomb fell as one death oh glory to god because here come christ triumphant after being dead what about this bride of jesus christ after they reckon you dead after the world say you can't make it after this one write you off and that one write you off after you come dry dry dry like dry bones can these bones live is the bride gonna live are you going to live i say yes sir you're going to live. [Applause] that that made the body of jesus told watch coal stiff and dead in the grave shaking to life and rise again roll away the stone i am he that was dead so dead till the sun said he was dead the moon said he was dead the star said he was dead all nature said he was dead and now the whole world has to recognize that he's alive again he is not only mechanics god's word but he's the dynamics to prove it so that's what we have to come to preach the gospel not only the word but the dynamics the proof the word itself and he being the groom the bride has to come forth because it's part of him and it can only be here we go you don't know what a bride is it can only be the manifestation of the fulfilling of all the revelations any other has spoken of the bride so the pride will be a manifestation of god himself oh glory to god hallelujah no wonder when jesus took the book he could leave off that bat to declare the day of vengeance of our god because he know mrs jesus christ would go into the temple and pick up them very same scripture and read a book declare jubilee and then vengeance declare jubilee to free your family declare jubilee and then judgment to the world or give the lord a shout there will be one more ride i'll ride this trail once more oh glory to god here we go if it does something from the groom it isn't the bride because she is flesh of his flesh boon of his bone life of his life power is power she is him as one and woman are one the woman thinking from his side she had taken a spirit feminist pray from him the flesh from his side made more mechanics and dynamics the wife the spirit of him the flesh of him put it together made mechanics and dynamics oh glory to god so when you're talking about these sons manifested i know people like to talk about a scripture a quote bring bringing up the hidden mysteries right sons but praise god when their creation is great growing up for their manifestations of god he's not talking about revealing mysteries reveal the messenger to put seeds inside of you to bring clear and bring the time of the revelation of these things being known when it all manifestation he explained what that is hallelujah go right back to genesis to the original know the world and he quoted the world has grown in nature is growing and crying everything moving what for for the manifestation of the sons of god when true sons born sons filled sons speak and their word is backed not just speak but their word is backed and he explain what that is i believe we are on the board of it right now say to this monkton brother i desire so and so a certain thing done i don't believe in jesus christ i give it to you in the name of jesus christ he said there's a manifestation that's what you're talking about you want something i give it to the name of jesus christ there's a manifestation what did peter did what did peter say he said silver and gold have i none such as i have i give it unto you rise up and walk in the name of jesus christ there's a manifestation [Applause] but i'm giving an example oh brother my crops are burning out younger i haven't had any rain i'm sending you rain in the name of the lord and there she coming so far my insider yeah crops did rain he'd have no rain and a brother come and say i sent you remember jesus christ and reign back at the drop saddle fall glory to god that's your manifestation you mean that had to come that'll come press can't come before that that'll become first person to come and press that oh glory to god press i come from the talk press coming to fight what has been manifested oh glory to god not no explanation it's manifestation oh give the lord some praise peter [Applause] and this is where i get inspiration from brother brown for we know now as a man asked me a few moments ago about the coming and rapture he said we have lived time the time of the raptors at hand and we are looking for a rapturing feat that can pull the church together oh you mean the church can stay as it is all them mighty message popes um running the kingdoms something had to pull it together you mean all them bones lean all around it had to have a bone revival for a second no because one can't drop a whole bunny on some foot bone they're not a man like a foot bone foot bone had a finally ankle bone and ankle bone had to find a hip bone everything they get connected and then you have flesh on top of that the man's still there you know but he's standing it coming closer it's almost as if god formed man again from the dust of the earth and then take genesis one man and put in genesis two men a man become a living soul so this bride that scattered all around the world look like she can't get together she can't do it and go what i'm gonna do with that you know when god blew praise god going on the blow when god blew his breath everything else theater where you know glory to god hallelujah when moses was facing the red sea and and then people crying to go back to egypt because they missed the position down there and again i fight because they have no position in that position in the wilderness they say let me go back to heroin and moses called me and i wrote to the lord help me god say why cry on me speak and bring the people forward i'll give you a return ticket to bring them to my mountain you will let the red sea stop you nothing must stop this brighter jesus christ can these posts live is anything too hard for the lord is that questions you have to answer don't talk with doubt don't talk with fear don't talk with unbelief give the lord an answer holy the god moses says stand still and see the salvation of the lord your god glory to god what moses did normally ever did before raise up his staff undersea the wind of god by the breath of his nostrils pearls blew up on the red sea and they sang the song of moses and they walked on trichome all glorious called the power of god upon a man that was under the blood of bulls and goats what about a man under the blood of jesus god help me this morning what about the bride of jesus christ under the blood of jesus christ that take us right back to eden as if we never sin as if we never fail as if we never fell as if we never did fall or give the lord a shout in the house what a power [Applause] glory glory glory watch we are looking for a rapture and fate that can pull the church together and give it some supernatural strength that can change these bodies that we live in oh glory to god when the church get together it brings power that's why god hates division god hates separation god hit man's system and ideas and he would bless it oh glory to god you remove ministers if you have to move take them out amen knock them completely out shake things and turn them upside down but there's going to be a price revival there's going to be a great gathering before we leave here and if you think god's not serious what abandon said when the press come down when the pressure come on it will drive the churches together they recognize the devil coming oh you believe six seals you'll be five seed foresee no seed have sealed if the devil asks that question you know all whom this message will be under persecution every one of them and they recognize they don't have power that they think they have they only have talk power what we need is holy ghost power power to stand at the side of the minority and rebuke and watch the black skies roll back and the power of god moving and take over glory to god that is what the holy ghost was given for hallelujah praise god praise god goliath good luck and dragon balls because they them fellas are meet god then fellas they never got encounter so goliath knew he had the upper hand for 30 days 40 days day and night he come and terrorizing them send me a man ain't nobody big like him he's a giant and you're all right he's bigger than your own self nobody had tall as him and bigger than he big and bad yeah come david david david david they come to fight david come to bring a little sandwich for his brothers his brothers are issues with him they say where they come here for they come to see the battles what are going on them sharpening short and they're looking at goliath they polish polishing shield i'm not going to look at all that they're polishing their shoes i'm not looking at goliath and when they say okay are gone gone come on then goliath happened to walk that day and say send me a man they will say who is he where he come from he is he don't belong here he's not one of us [Music] there is a how long this thing going on how long only been how you long in this condition [Applause] glory david let me see it did he start going then they said he decided to give a testimony he said you know what one day i was seeing a sheep land come and i kill him yeah come and kill him and the god see so you do that i kill him i kill him but he god that deliver me or did he handle the beer and land see that dude there i'll take him out to him brother if you see that shoulder run to tell soul there's a brother in the camp he give a testimony so i said bring it bring bring fast they're feeling shame because after all these days nobody ever never gone telling her so they hear about some fella anybody he was really taking anybody if you raise up your hand you say i'll give him my daughter i'll give you money he's always right i i i ain't going for that terrorist you see that dude in the wrong position david was so confident the bible said he ran to meet him [Applause] you see if you're not sure it's a wonderful evil with that boy that giant a giant you know or could because we have been there before yeah them ten spies them ten ministers who went and see the land and eat grapes and everything else they said we can't take it because we see jazz they said did they see you no in our own eyes we felt so small so david went to meet him and david just started this thing and we know this story so what we need is supernatural strength listen to obama drill down deeper when we see a god see see when we see a god that can raise the dead off the floor or out in the yard and bring him back to life again and present him before us when we see a god that could take cancer that eat a manta shadow and raise him up strong healthy man that ought to give rapture and fear to the people [Applause] so i'll say it this way no divine healing no rapture that's something like a sting in it let me phrase it differently let me say how he said it he said how can we have faith for the rapture when we can't even feed for divine healing because the rapture is a glorified divine healing what a rapture doing is changing your bodies [Music] into a glorified condition so you have to have a higher fit than you have right now so he put it to a dead being raised cancer being cured and when you understand that your faith gone higher and higher higher and higher in brahman meetings of faith going so he says milky white anything could happen oh how anything can happen all things are possible [Applause] you said when presented you before when we see a god we're going to take a cancer wash your time and eat a man to a shadow and raise him up to a strong healthy man that ought to give wrapped in faith to the people when that light flashes from the sky and the trumpet songs the body of christ will quickly be gathered together and change in a moment taken into the heavens there'll be something like that happen and our school of theology can never produce that yet they intellectually are all right but you've got to meet that light you've got to find out something my god let me get the whole flesh here now four roman messengers of death death took down god's tree four messengers of death killed the tree four missions of life restored the tree by four death messengers killed it then four life messengers were restored what was it first martin luther justification second generation vacation third pentecost with the restoration of the gifts the holy ghost baptism holy ghost what was the thought the word and that's what god gave the prophet the word right in the last days of malachi 4 elijah is to come but the very word the word of the lord came to the prophet in the evening light is to come to restore and bring back what turn the heart of the turin back to the feet of the fathers fought light so the fought light is to bring a restoration to what to the fate of the fathers what's the four stages of the coming of the church then and this is where he tied into the ezekiel scripture we read because we know that's pertaining to the jews but listen to this watch the four stages of that come and thought of the church was the four stages of ezekiel dry bones coming forth but the life only come not when the sinews skin was on them but when the wind blew in them and that is when come back the fourth message of life so listen how am i when ezekiel was asked can these bones live and he said don't know us god prophesied and said they shall live and i will cause life to come into them now god didn't tell ezekiel yet the process but god gave him the end game life will come into that so he give the end and then come back this way to work it suddenly there's a noise prophecy bone to bone hallelujah prophesy flesh come upon bone oh glory to god skin come upon flesh and then there's one another prophecy prophesied to the wind oh glory to god the four winds prophesied to the will there's a prophecy for life to come in that fought move was life coming in hallelujah and the end of it a mighty army oh blessed be the name of the lord sign vacation brought back the back doctrine of holiness pentecostal brought back rejoicing pray what was the thought the word the word made flesh fruits of the proof of his resurrection that christ has finally here we go after justification implanted sun vacation implanted back in the holy ghost organization died or christ has again centered himself like the cap of the pyramid first line justification signification baptism holy ghost then what the coming of the camp what is it that holy ghost bunch that's the bride being honed out to fit with that same kind of ministry god had cut in europe at church this church cut you to fit a ministry which is the ministry of jesus christ hear what it is for a ministry he had when he went away when he comes back it will catch the whole thing in the rapture where she is justified sanctified baptist that premier stand again the house of god will live again the tree of life is growing again oh blessed be the name of the lord hallelujah i'm on the home stretch here now praise god hallelujah praise peter jesus how do we get into the body by one spirit first corinthians 12 we are baptized into one body by one spirit we are baptized and the spirit is the life of christ isn't that right the life of christ and the life of any seed he was the word seed brings the sea to life you get it i told you in phoenix so long ago i was talking to a brother i talked about the citrus tree and it's an orange tree but it was lemon and tangerine and angelo and grapefruit it's all citrus isn't that right and many of you growers know in citrus valley it will be its own each one being its own but if that tree ever puts forth an original branch it will bring forth oranges and if god ever does anything again in the church it will be original back to the word again oh hallelujah praise god hallelujah are you with me therefore the word or nothing he the word is vindicated he the word properly vindicated is the headship the head of the church he is the word the headship he is properly identified vindicated by his own spirit being in the church the person showing himself vindication is direct proof to the entire body so when the holy spirit god almighty was veiling that prophet he was showing to the world that he is not dead he was jesus christ the same yesterday he then ever manifested himself through the flesh of a 20th century prophet now he's about a man even himself through the flesh of a bride oh glory to god that's why he said the ministry has reached perfection when christ is reproduced in the natural that is beyond talk that's beyond sermon that's beyond a good message oh glory to god hallelujah then we are united under one vindicated headship wow one vindicated headship not one pastor not one group not one church all one inspiration and this one had the inspiration this underworld inspiration not that united under one phoenix headship that is christ the word of god then here we go he switch it our headship is a kingdom all you mean we don't have headquarters no our headship now becomes a kingdom and the kingdom of god is within you so you can understand now why you say when they say low here go here go here forget them behold the kingdom is within you and the kingdom is what the word in you turn into power so that's why i say the rapture is not outside in it's inside out you will have the rapture in you because you have the kingdom in you nobody can see it touch it interfere with it they can't transform it they can't boil it out they had to boil out john in the alopacmos they couldn't boil him in hot water they couldn't burn it out in the fiery furnace they can't kill it it's the holy ghost it's the holy ghost and power it's keeping me alive hallelujah praise god you shall come up please oh glory to god it's all over me it's keeping me alive it's the holy ghost on fire holy ocean power keeping me alive here we go watch we belong to a kingdom and the kingdom is the word of god made spirit and life in our own life bringing the past every promise in this day as the day the day when god in the wood was one so if the headship of the body that is redeemed to bring the message of the last day and in the last day has come down in like manner vindicating himself his body he's talking about you the bride will do the works that he promised like in sin mark 16 his body was not held in the grave but was recognized with him in a resurrection do you get it then the body of his believing children will not be held in the grave when he comes but will be recognized with him no grave god hold this body down hallelujah hallelujah they couldn't hold christ's body down and the pride is part of christ they can't hold you down either glory to god because he died here we go for the purpose to resurrect his pride the body recognized because it is his body because it is his word so completely even from the nomination him to think that he is the word oh here we go his body was not held in the grave hallelujah and the word was done through the age of luther wesley has begun to raise up its power it began to move it moved a little more now it's coming up identification now here we go this is about paul's inspiration now the life in the body is of indication that the rapture is at hand when you see the headship and the body becoming one and the fullness of the measure of his manifestation shows that the body is about to receive the headship this has nothing to do with press coming down oh give the lord a shout is that none with us close being closed down this have to do with you recognize the life coming into the body is evidence the raptors trust around the corner because i'm acting like christ i am talking like christ i am living like christ i am doing what jesus did oh my he began to bring life to his body all right here we go justified in his sight why are we justified you know what justified me right not forgiven but as if you never did it why are we justified we are his victory the church is his victory we come forth in his last days with this glorious gospel showing his victory he died for this purpose and we are proof of his victory when we see him coming down and living among the church that is his victory it shows that he couldn't keep him in the grave neither can they keep us that's right we are already potentially raised because we are raised from the dead from unbelief in his word to an eternal word of god which is him himself working through us manifesting himself that he is the same yesterday today and forever there we go i'm almost finished when the word moves on dung into the body from the head what is it the same word moves from the head as the day come close dung into the body indicating that they are one so let's say the rapture is here as you get in the era the word from the head it's coming under the body the very life of christ is being reproduced back into the church you have nothing to do with what putin doing you have to do with what america is doing what the world is doing because there'll be two in a bed one taking one left glory the god here we go notice the vindicated word in his body is his very victory and reason of his death hallelujah see the death not in the spirit when he died you only die in the flesh his spirit went to hell and preached the souls in prison he only died when he raised up again and quick and quick and means made me the life his flesh which was his body that was the word i'd been laying dead for years but gradually through the reserve reformation she is standing up on her feet and he tying back to ezekiel again he said oh i wish i had time to go back to ezekiel and pull of them dry bones he said can these bone lives he said prophesy how can prophecy come but only to a prophet oh glory to god i'm done oh praise god how can hallelujah hallelujah could start to play something how can the prophecy come except you a prophet we are prophesying the same prophecy it's a fresh prophecy of the same prophecy may the lord bless you thank you so much you have been a wonderful audience god bless you by
