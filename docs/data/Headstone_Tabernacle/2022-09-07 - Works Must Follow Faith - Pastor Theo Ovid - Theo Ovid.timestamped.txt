[28:22] praise the lord we thank god for his
[28:24] grace to be here tonight
[28:25] god bless you a little bit of your
[28:27] bibles i'd like you to enter two
[28:28] portions of scripture james 2
[28:31] verse 26
[28:32] and galatians 5 1 verse 2 6
[28:36] james 2
[28:38] 26
[28:39] and galatians 5
[28:42] through 6.
[28:48] we read from james two
[28:50] for as the body without the spirit is
[28:52] dead
[28:53] so faith
[28:54] without works
[28:56] is that also he's actually saying that's
[28:59] a dead fate
[29:02] and from galatians chapter five and six
[29:04] is therefore in jesus christ
[29:06] neither circumcision a village anything
[29:09] nor uncircumcision
[29:11] but faith
[29:12] which work it by love
[29:14] let's borrow heads heavenly father we
[29:15] thank you for
[29:17] the holy scriptures and lord i pray that
[29:19] you would breed upon it lord breathe
[29:21] life
[29:22] lord we are mortals and
[29:25] our words is nothing lord but your word
[29:27] is everything and if you can only speak
[29:30] a word to us tonight we'll be so
[29:31] grateful father we are looking to you
[29:33] and we are dependent upon you take me
[29:36] out of the way and may your spirit speak
[29:38] expressly to your elect people here
[29:40] tonight those that are connected those
[29:42] that will hear the tape may have
[29:43] presence come upon them all in jesus
[29:45] might ask it
[29:46] amen on the name god bless you may be
[29:48] seated
[29:49] praise god welcome thank you for being
[29:51] out here tonight
[29:52] go praise the name of the lord
[29:55] hallelujah our title works
[29:58] must follow faith
[30:01] that's my title tonight
[30:03] and have an inspiration faith which
[30:05] worketh by love
[30:07] or praise the name of the lord
[30:09] and um
[30:12] the scripture in um
[30:15] oh this is
[30:17] let me see
[30:21] since jes this is james 21st first but i
[30:24] was reading the second chapter was not
[30:26] abram or father justified by works
[30:28] when he had offered isaac his son upon
[30:30] the altar
[30:31] see
[30:32] thou
[30:33] how fate
[30:34] wrote with works
[30:36] and by works feet was made perfect and
[30:38] the scripture was fulfilled which said
[30:40] abraham believed god it was imputed
[30:43] under him for righteousness and he was
[30:45] called a friend of god and read that
[30:46] last scripture again abraham
[30:49] believed god
[30:51] and it was imputed unto him
[30:54] what was imputed
[30:55] his belief in god
[30:56] as righteousness
[30:58] in other words god counted
[31:01] his faith
[31:02] as righteousness his faith made him
[31:04] righteous
[31:06] that's how god saw it
[31:07] and then james and then paul in romans
[31:10] says what shall we see in that abram or
[31:12] father's pertaining to the flesh has
[31:13] found for if amen was justified
[31:16] by works he had way after glory but not
[31:18] before god but what saith the scripture
[31:21] abraham believed god and it was
[31:24] accounted unto him for righteousness
[31:27] this is righteousness without works god
[31:29] conked his faith his to his feet in god
[31:32] and to him that worketh his reward not
[31:35] reckon of grace but of debt
[31:37] now paul
[31:38] here obama's breaking it down is
[31:41] referring to what god sees in abraham
[31:43] and james he's talking about now how
[31:46] james justifying by works he said no and
[31:50] he brought him forth abroad and said
[31:51] look now towards heaven and tell the
[31:53] stars if they'll be able to number them
[31:55] he said so shall thy seed be and he
[31:57] believed in the lord abraham and he
[31:58] counted it for righteousness now the two
[32:01] men we are talking on feet
[32:03] paul justified abraham by what god saw
[32:06] in abraham but james justified abraham
[32:10] by what man saw in abraham
[32:12] so paul said he's justified by faith and
[32:15] james says he's justified by his works
[32:18] praise the name of the lord now let's go
[32:20] let's go
[32:21] but about
[32:22] now when a man has become a son
[32:25] if he's going to approach his father
[32:27] he just walks up to the father and said
[32:29] father i come to visit you and see you
[32:31] about something that's his approach
[32:34] but now to the stranger there's another
[32:37] approach
[32:38] and there's an approach to god for many
[32:40] different things now if i was going to
[32:43] my father and my father was living and i
[32:45] wanted to approach him for a financial
[32:47] matter it would be a little different
[32:49] from another kind of approach
[32:51] i want to tell him how much i thought of
[32:53] him and so forth it's the approach you
[32:55] have to use to meet god
[32:58] now when man's sin back in the beginning
[33:00] the gardener eden he separated himself
[33:02] and severed himself from all approach to
[33:04] god
[33:05] his very lifeline he was separated from
[33:08] his maker with no way at all of ever
[33:10] seeing him again because his sin his
[33:13] unbelief in trusting god had separated
[33:16] him
[33:17] and that word i want to emphasize trust
[33:19] in god or depending on god because the
[33:23] problem is when we get independent of
[33:25] god
[33:27] because god wants us to depend on him
[33:30] and trust him
[33:32] okay
[33:33] now okay
[33:35] and it separated him now that's the only
[33:37] sin there is is your sin of unbelief
[33:40] unbelief is your sin and the only reason
[33:42] today that we are not where we should be
[33:45] is because of our unbelief
[33:47] and it's because the miracles and things
[33:50] isn't in the church as they should be is
[33:52] because of unbelief
[33:54] separating us and because that poor man
[33:57] out there is sinning and murder and
[33:59] stuff in our world today and all kind of
[34:00] disastrous things happen is because of
[34:02] unbelief in god that's all now if we
[34:05] believe there are just two things you
[34:06] either believe or believe not
[34:08] either one if you do believe then the
[34:11] works of righteousness follow a believer
[34:15] if you do not believe the works on of
[34:18] unrighteousness follows the only thing
[34:21] lying stealing theft and thought is
[34:23] attributes of unbelief and
[34:24] long-suffering patience goodness mercies
[34:26] and so forth are attributes of belief in
[34:29] god
[34:29] or faith in god so when man was cut off
[34:32] with no way of approach his only
[34:34] lifeline everything was cut off he was
[34:37] left darkly hopelessly without any way
[34:39] that protest maker and when god come
[34:42] down hunting for the man i want you to
[34:44] notice this it always god hunting the
[34:48] man
[34:48] not man hunting for god do you ever
[34:51] think of that that no man at any time
[34:53] any age that ever desire to serve god
[34:56] never have been his nature is against it
[34:58] he might have some kind of intellectual
[35:00] thoughts he thinks that he does believe
[35:02] god but he actually really believes god
[35:05] he becomes converted
[35:08] and a new creature as soon as believes
[35:10] god
[35:11] he maybe intellectually believe in god
[35:14] but when he believes from his heart
[35:16] aha so he's talking about believing from
[35:18] your heart now when he believes on his
[35:20] heart then he is convicted
[35:22] and becomes a member of the body of
[35:24] christ when he's converted from his
[35:26] heart
[35:27] not from his intellect not because he's
[35:30] the writing you know the best thing to
[35:32] do no no no when you're converted from
[35:33] the heart
[35:34] then it's on the inside
[35:36] oh praise the name of the lord now i
[35:39] believe
[35:40] we don't have desperation is because of
[35:42] lack of love the love of god
[35:45] and i think that the love of god causes
[35:48] desperation
[35:49] hallelujah now we have to believe this
[35:51] just as the word coming out
[35:53] this doesn't need no interpretation he
[35:55] said i believe that the love of god
[35:57] causes desperation
[35:59] if god is in you the talking inside of
[36:01] you and you see the condition of the
[36:03] times that people waging in sin the way
[36:05] they are it throw you into desperation
[36:08] i believe it will now the word plainly
[36:10] states if you wanted galatians 5 6 faith
[36:13] work it by love
[36:14] now faith
[36:16] work it by love and the only way that
[36:18] you can have faith is to have love first
[36:21] because after all faith is love's
[36:23] incentive
[36:25] praise god fate it's an incentive to
[36:28] love if you don't have love you can't
[36:29] have faith
[36:30] how can you have faith in your wife if
[36:32] you know the lover
[36:34] pray and that's his filio how about
[36:35] agape to god so how can it be if you
[36:38] don't love god so all this faith for
[36:40] translation grace and and faith to leave
[36:43] here faith that worked by
[36:45] love
[36:46] not politics
[36:48] not not argument fear that booked by
[36:50] love if you said to your if you said you
[36:53] love your wife and never tell her about
[36:54] it
[36:55] never sit down and make love to her and
[36:57] express it to her and kiss her and hug
[36:58] her and tell her she's the best cook in
[37:00] the country all the things that you know
[37:02] how pretty she is how much you love her
[37:04] if you don't do that she will never know
[37:06] it
[37:06] and that is the way if you do love her
[37:08] you express it and that's the way we do
[37:11] to god
[37:12] when we love him we tell him about it we
[37:16] sit down and we adore him
[37:18] and worship him
[37:19] love drives us to that
[37:21] oh praise the name of the lord so when
[37:23] you see somebody praise god they can't
[37:25] worship they have dead and the grace of
[37:28] god save you and you can't say nothing
[37:30] and they can't say hallelujah glory
[37:31] praise god you know something is wrong
[37:33] somewhere the question how many love is
[37:35] towards god praise god they have nothing
[37:37] to do something for you yet he doesn't
[37:39] have to do something for you to love him
[37:41] praise god he loves you he he first love
[37:43] you praise god you just trying to love
[37:45] him back
[37:46] oh praise the name of the lord amen
[37:49] all right
[37:50] praise god
[37:52] when david fell in sin david you know
[37:54] david
[37:56] take it easy take our next man wife and
[37:57] everything else and
[37:59] old prophet
[38:00] bald-headed fellow stomping old natan
[38:02] out of the wilderness sat down and said
[38:03] david
[38:05] how's everything going david said fine
[38:06] fine what prophet of god lived there
[38:08] hallelujah
[38:10] he thought everything was fine
[38:12] he thought he could hide it
[38:14] but you can't hide from god
[38:16] he knows what you're thinking right now
[38:18] he knows your thoughts for he is god
[38:21] that holy spirit that's in the building
[38:23] this morning knows your thoughts
[38:25] who you are where you come from what you
[38:27] have done for jesus christ is the same
[38:29] yesterday today and forever
[38:31] god had revealed it to that prophet he
[38:33] said david
[38:35] to the prophet began to tell a story
[38:37] david there was a rich man lived on the
[38:38] side of the road he had a whole lot of
[38:40] sheep he was very rich a man lived on
[38:42] this side of the road was poor he had
[38:44] one lamb he treated it like a daughter
[38:47] he feed it out of the same spoon he eat
[38:49] with he slept with the lamb everything
[38:50] it was just like a daughter to him and
[38:52] one day a visitor came instead of the
[38:54] rich man taking one of his own sheep and
[38:56] making a feast for the visitor well
[38:59] instead he went over and took the poor
[39:01] man's lamb and by force took the man's
[39:03] lamb slayed it amid her feasts
[39:06] that was david's passions he had 500
[39:08] wives and when he seen uriah's wife
[39:10] instead of taking one of his 500 wives
[39:12] to or satisfy his passions he went and
[39:14] took this other man's wife then kill
[39:16] uriah
[39:17] then she become a mother david didn't
[39:19] know what he was doing why
[39:21] david was ready to pronounce judgment
[39:24] now watch this
[39:25] david was ready to pronounce judgment
[39:28] that's the way we are
[39:31] we are always we can always judge the
[39:35] other fellow
[39:36] but when it comes to us
[39:41] that's the problem
[39:43] easy to judge this one that one people
[39:45] matter this one that one that one did
[39:47] not matter themselves
[39:48] judging yourself
[39:50] but when it comes to the other oh my
[39:52] that's different david said that man
[39:54] will pay for his life
[39:56] that come out of the david's mouth right
[39:58] the old prophet
[40:00] demi is narrowed down he said david
[40:02] surely you will not die
[40:05] now if god take david at his word he had
[40:08] to die
[40:09] but god's grace
[40:12] through the prophet
[40:13] told david
[40:15] surely
[40:16] you will not die
[40:18] but the sword will not leave your house
[40:19] till it's totally pulled your heart
[40:22] for you at that rich man
[40:24] it was different then wasn't it
[40:27] oh let's go
[40:29] what save david
[40:30] when his own judgment said that man will
[40:32] die he will pay to the utmost he will
[40:35] pay for it for his life and the prophet
[40:37] said surely
[40:38] barbara says greece
[40:40] you will not die
[40:41] you will not die david greece has saved
[40:44] you

[46:58] think of it
[47:00] love and grace is sisters
[47:03] twin sisters
[47:04] you can't have grace
[47:06] without having love
[47:08] they are twin sisters
[47:09] oh glory they can't have grace without
[47:11] having love
[47:13] praise god praise god you notice how
[47:15] legal isn't legalist people has pushed a
[47:17] hard look
[47:19] and they're not loving
[47:21] they're not caring
[47:23] have compassion what he wanted is it law
[47:26] moses said stoner she caught in the very
[47:29] act of adultery
[47:30] oh my god they quote the law
[47:33] to get the big stones and just say which
[47:35] when which one of you without sin put
[47:37] the mirror back into the head cast a
[47:38] full stone okay
[47:41] all right so grace is what save us so
[47:43] what exactly before you can have grace
[47:45] you have to have love before you can
[47:47] actually show somebody a favor you love
[47:49] them right
[47:51] or wrong
[47:52] they don't have to be right
[47:54] to love them and they cannot stop you
[47:57] from loving them
[47:59] whether they hate you whether they
[48:00] despise you whether they reject you you
[48:03] still have the power to love
[48:10] and then cannot stop you from loving
[48:13] oh give the lord some praises isn't that
[48:15] something tonight
[48:17] all right
[48:18] so watch something now so love and grace
[48:20] is the same thing they're like twin
[48:21] sisters love and grace we can't see one
[48:24] without the other one so god so loved
[48:26] the world he gave his only begotten son
[48:29] he shed his grace and brought in into
[48:31] our hearts through the holy ghost
[48:32] there's nothing you can do without
[48:34] working one with the other grace god's
[48:36] grace is what save us
[48:38] what is it the grace of god
[48:41] the grace of god god brought grace into
[48:44] our lives
[48:45] by his love for us
[48:47] there is something else grace can't do
[48:50] are you ready
[48:51] grace can't be bought
[48:54] grace can't be sold
[48:57] and i can say this now grace can't be
[48:59] earned
[49:01] so if it fasts 40 days does not own your
[49:04] grace
[49:05] you can fast 100 days it doesn't earn
[49:07] your grace
[49:08] you can't work for grace
[49:10] grace come from sovereign
[49:13] that's why you should worship god
[49:15] that's why he said thank god and bless
[49:17] god and appreciate him and love him
[49:20] he said it's by a sovereign one here we
[49:22] go you can't bargain for it
[49:25] lord if i do this you'll get your grace
[49:27] no you can't bargain for it you can't
[49:29] say god i'll do so and so and you will
[49:30] do so and so you can't do that
[49:33] god won't do it you can't pull nothing
[49:36] out of god god gives it to you by his
[49:39] grace
[49:40] oh could we give god some praises
[49:41] tonight
[49:42] not him that will it or him that run it
[49:45] but is god that showed mercy isn't that
[49:48] right
[49:49] oh glory to god
[49:51] let's hit some bible now ephesians 2
[49:54] and it says here with it for by grace
[49:57] are you saved through faith
[50:00] not over ourselves
[50:02] it is the gift of god
[50:04] not of works at least any man should
[50:06] boast
[50:07] oh glory to god by grace you are saved
[50:10] through faith
[50:11] not doctrine
[50:13] not i believe in message
[50:14] by grace you are saved through faith
[50:17] not of works such a good boost it's just
[50:19] suffering grace
[50:20] when you be you were preached to and you
[50:23] respond to the gospel it was the grace
[50:25] of god
[50:26] talking in your heart is nothing you did
[50:29] you was pleasing pan you were smoking
[50:30] cigarettes you was floating around
[50:32] fooling around but the gospel hit you
[50:34] and something convict your heart that
[50:36] was the grace and love of god you didn't
[50:39] ask god for that god did that for you
[50:41] praise god praise god praise god who he
[50:44] foreign called who he call it justified
[50:46] oh glory to god who is justified he has
[50:49] already glorified it's the grace of god
[50:51] that has done that for you and that
[50:53] should give you a humble heart
[50:54] [Applause]
[51:00] i'm reading it again for my gracious
[51:02] save ephesians 4 2 8
[51:04] and that not of ourselves
[51:06] it is the gift of god not of works at
[51:09] least any man should boast
[51:11] now if it's of works you could boast
[51:13] because this is what i do you see how
[51:15] much work i do
[51:16] you can beat your chest but god make
[51:18] sure this thing have no chest beating in
[51:20] it
[51:21] oh give the lord some praises that is
[51:23] for every one of us for the preacher to
[51:25] the janitor god make sure it have no
[51:28] chest beating in this thing nobody can
[51:31] beat the chest based upon what they do
[51:33] what they're doing and what they want to
[51:34] do it has nothing to do with that it's
[51:36] the grace of god coming to you oh glory
[51:39] to god hallelujah praise god not of
[51:41] works at least any man should boast
[51:43] verse 10 for we are his workmanship
[51:46] created in christ jesus unto good works
[51:49] which god before ordained that we should
[51:52] walk
[51:53] in him
[51:54] let me really amplify that that one was
[51:56] there not because of works
[51:59] not the fulfilling of the law's demands
[52:02] at least any man should pose
[52:04] it is not a result of what anyone can
[52:07] possibly do
[52:08] so no one
[52:10] can pride himself in it
[52:12] and take glory to himself
[52:15] oh my
[52:16] hallelujah romans 4
[52:20] it says here
[52:21] now to him that wicket
[52:24] is the reward not reckon of grace but of
[52:26] death
[52:27] but to him that worketh not
[52:30] but believe on him that justified the
[52:33] ungodly
[52:35] these words are powerful his faith
[52:38] is counted
[52:39] by god i feel to run out inclusive right
[52:41] now his faith is counted for
[52:43] righteousness
[52:46] i don't think this strike people yet
[52:49] i'll read it again
[52:51] now to him that worketh is a reward that
[52:53] not reckon of grace but of debt
[52:55] is that god or you
[52:57] god owe you salvation because you're
[52:58] working for the lord and you're going to
[53:00] church doing this i know what i do now
[53:01] you and your ideas there's nobody bible
[53:03] teaching here this is not what paul
[53:05] teaching here the paul said to him that
[53:07] worketh is a reward not reckon of grace
[53:10] but of debt
[53:12] so god owe you because of what you see
[53:14] yourself doing
[53:16] and working and laboring
[53:18] donkey tinger
[53:20] oxtting layer laboring
[53:22] but to him that worketh not
[53:26] but believe on him
[53:28] that justified the ungodly
[53:31] his faith somebody say faith
[53:33] his faith
[53:35] is counted for righteousness
[53:38] i wonder how much people really believe
[53:39] that
[53:40] oh glory to god hallelujah praise god so
[53:44] faith comes to what we believe
[53:48] works come to what we do
[53:51] so we have what we do
[53:53] and what we believe
[53:55] but abraham
[53:57] he said no watch
[53:59] so in the deity of jesus christ if the
[54:01] lord god could come here and confirm
[54:03] that it is the truth not only that but
[54:05] by his word he confirms the truth and by
[54:07] signs and wonders he confirms the truth
[54:09] then also grace is the truth then why
[54:12] would anyone criticize and say that
[54:14] grace is wrong
[54:16] we are saved by works we are saved by
[54:18] grace that true faith not by works work
[54:21] shows that you have been saved but what
[54:24] save you is the grace of god
[54:26] grace saves you grace is what god does
[54:29] for you
[54:30] works is what you do for god to show
[54:33] appreciation of what god did for you
[54:36] but by grace are you saved
[54:39] period
[54:42] [Applause]
[54:44] no works
[54:45] nothing you could do
[54:47] i know there's a strike here but one day
[54:49] go strike you
[54:52] grace saves you grace is what god does
[54:55] for you works is what you do for god to
[54:57] show appreciation of what god did for
[55:00] you but by grace are you saved some
[55:02] people think now he's going now into the
[55:04] humanistic of what people think all
[55:06] right here are these words some people
[55:08] think because i joined church put my
[55:11] name on the book that's all i have to do
[55:13] some people think because i shout that's
[55:16] all i have to do others think because i
[55:18] speak in tongues that's all i have to do
[55:20] something because i got power to heal
[55:22] the sick that's all i have to do it is
[55:24] not it's the grace of god that saves you
[55:27] god's amazing grace i cannot trust in
[55:31] any merits some said well there's a
[55:33] great man that man i've heard him stand
[55:35] up and do this and that i've heard

[55:41] so i can't claim oh god so he has 40
[55:43] plus years in ministry therefore that
[55:45] what that means

[59:13] lost
[59:14] it is grace that saves you
[59:17] caught grace to the human race
[59:20] let me say this my sinner friend you may
[59:22] be here this morning a prostitute
[59:24] you may be here this morning a woman
[59:26] chaser
[59:27] you may hear a drunkard a gambler or
[59:29] murderer
[59:30] you might be here in pure husband impure
[59:33] wife
[59:34] you might be the values of sinner
[59:36] you say
[59:38] i am past that stage of redemption no
[59:40] you are not
[59:41] or you wouldn't be at the church this
[59:43] morning
[59:44] grace will make a way for you
[59:46] in this dark hour
[59:48] if you will accept it
[59:52] you have to be willing to accept it
[59:55] accept it
[59:56] you say accept it
[59:58] you have to accept it to know that you
[59:59] have no works you have nothing to bring
[1:00:00] nothing in my arms i bring simply to die
[1:00:02] cross-cycling nothing
[1:00:05] just accept it oh god grace i've taken
[1:00:07] it tonight i'm going with that tonight
[1:00:08] i've taken that oh glory to god i gotta
[1:00:11] offer grace
[1:00:12] i'm going with that
[1:00:14] anybody that's willing to repent
[1:00:16] the grace of god still goes for you
[1:00:19] the grace of god is searching for you
[1:00:21] so that goes for you back sitting this
[1:00:23] morning
[1:00:24] the grace of god is still looking for
[1:00:25] you if you just repent god grace
[1:00:29] is sufficient
[1:00:31] so it's important to understand it is
[1:00:33] not of works
[1:00:34] at least man can pose
[1:00:36] with works man can post what you have
[1:00:39] done what i have done
[1:00:41] this boasting comes from pride
[1:00:44] and that was the downfall of the angel
[1:00:47] known as lucifer
[1:00:52] you see that
[1:00:54] i will be like the most high i will
[1:00:56] ascend to the knot
[1:00:58] i want to be like god and so on and
[1:00:59] he'll get a whole bunch of angels to
[1:01:01] follow him and that's why you get your
[1:01:02] boots and get kicked out
[1:01:04] now first peter 5 5 says
[1:01:07] likewise he younger
[1:01:09] submit
[1:01:10] yourselves unto the elder
[1:01:13] ye all of you
[1:01:15] be subject one to another
[1:01:17] be closed with humility
[1:01:20] for god
[1:01:22] resisted
[1:01:23] the proud
[1:01:24] and give greece to the humble right go
[1:01:27] let's do what
[1:01:28] resist push depart back
[1:01:32] when you're looking and you're praying
[1:01:33] he pulled praying go there and say you
[1:01:34] know pushing them back
[1:01:36] resist the proud but give
[1:01:39] grace to the humble
[1:01:42] hallelujah
[1:01:43] so god's way of making us righteous
[1:01:46] doesn't bring on pride
[1:01:52] actually the first sign of the holy
[1:01:53] ghost is what
[1:01:55] humility
[1:01:56] the very first time
[1:01:58] of the holy ghost is humility
[1:02:01] romans 11 6
[1:02:03] says
[1:02:05] and if by grace
[1:02:07] then it is no more works otherwise grace
[1:02:10] is no more grace
[1:02:12] and if it be of works then it's no more
[1:02:14] grace otherwise work is no more work
[1:02:17] you cannot earn greece
[1:02:19] you can't live on the boat
[1:02:21] is either you're walking or you're
[1:02:22] greeting
[1:02:24] hallelujah praise god you're on the work
[1:02:26] labor law or you're under grace
[1:02:29] isn't that right
[1:02:30] romans 3 20 says
[1:02:33] therefore
[1:02:35] by the deeds of the law there shall no
[1:02:38] flesh be justified in his sight
[1:02:40] for by the law is the knowledge of sin
[1:02:43] and the amplified they say for no person
[1:02:45] will be justified made righteous
[1:02:48] acquitted
[1:02:49] and judged acceptable in his sight by
[1:02:52] observing the works prescribed by the
[1:02:54] law
[1:02:55] for the refunction of the law is to make
[1:02:58] men recognize and be conscious of sin
[1:03:01] not mere perception but an acquaintance
[1:03:03] with sin which works toward repentance
[1:03:06] faith and holy character
[1:03:08] so the law really is the discern and the
[1:03:10] exposed sin
[1:03:12] but it couldn't cure sin that job was
[1:03:15] for mr grace
[1:03:16] he said mr law identified you you failed
[1:03:19] here you're a sinner here this year this
[1:03:21] year this year but law couldn't correct
[1:03:23] that but grace
[1:03:25] grace
[1:03:26] graces will exchange your murder the man
[1:03:28] and grace come and put you and say no
[1:03:30] you are my son
[1:03:31] remember that story
[1:03:33] somebody killed the king's son the only
[1:03:34] son and they can't come to see what man
[1:03:36] that did their killing
[1:03:38] and when he see the man oh yeah let me
[1:03:39] send him oh god king i got in the temper
[1:03:42] and i didn't want to do it i didn't mean
[1:03:44] to do it but i'm sorry you lost your son
[1:03:46] the king put his woman and said no
[1:03:47] you're my son
[1:03:49] explain that
[1:03:50] and that man who was jailed walk out
[1:03:52] with the king as the king's son
[1:03:54] just lose her son and take up another
[1:03:56] son adopt another son rob another son
[1:03:59] you can't explain these things you can't
[1:04:00] explain how god could take you sometimes
[1:04:02] you say well why me lord why me lord you
[1:04:04] deserve to send me to hell but god chose
[1:04:06] you praise god he love you that's why
[1:04:09] you're here tonight praise god he wants
[1:04:11] to bless you he wants to help you he
[1:04:13] wants to encourage you he wants his
[1:04:15] grace extend to you his want has reached
[1:04:17] his love to reach down to you
[1:04:19] oh praise the name of the lord praise
[1:04:21] god you cannot earn grace praise god
[1:04:24] romans 3 20 therefore by the deeds of
[1:04:26] the lord there shall be no flesh be
[1:04:28] justified in his sight for by the law
[1:04:31] knowledge of sin okay
[1:04:34] so the book that really
[1:04:37] strike this legalism this this thing
[1:04:40] that after people get saved all of a
[1:04:42] sudden
[1:04:43] they start to drift the wrong way
[1:04:46] from god taking them around sinai
[1:04:47] hallelujah i'm saying oh god that jesus
[1:04:49] sweet jesus jesus was sweet
[1:04:51] and afterwards jesus come from so sweet
[1:04:54] until decided to judge others
[1:04:56] as to why
[1:04:58] this and that and you know and whatnot
[1:05:01] and legalism is a tough thing to deal
[1:05:03] with
[1:05:04] and paul addressed that in galatians and
[1:05:08] galatians 1
[1:05:10] verse 6 says i marvel that you so soon
[1:05:12] removed from him that called you
[1:05:15] into the grace of god onto another
[1:05:16] gospel
[1:05:17] so outside the greece
[1:05:19] gospel message corporal called another
[1:05:21] gospel
[1:05:22] which is not another
[1:05:24] but there be some
[1:05:26] that trouble you and would pervert the
[1:05:29] gospel of christ
[1:05:32] chapter three galatians one or foolish
[1:05:34] galatians who would be with you
[1:05:37] that you should not obey the truth
[1:05:40] before whose eyes jesus christ has been
[1:05:42] heaven evidently set forth crucify among
[1:05:45] you
[1:05:46] this only would i learn of you
[1:05:49] receiving the spirit by the works of the
[1:05:51] law
[1:05:52] or by the hearing of faith and this is a
[1:05:54] classy
[1:05:56] pauline
[1:05:57] expression are we bringing this out here
[1:05:59] are you so foolish
[1:06:00] paul rebook in the church galatians
[1:06:02] church having begun in the spirit you
[1:06:04] are now perfect by the flesh
[1:06:07] you're starting the spirit but no you're
[1:06:09] trying to work your way
[1:06:11] to get rewarded by god
[1:06:14] when your actions all along from the
[1:06:15] very beginning has been won like a
[1:06:17] childlike fate
[1:06:19] we trust and believe god when we came to
[1:06:20] the lord we didn't know the word we
[1:06:22] didn't know all what god said but we
[1:06:24] trust him because he saved us or we know
[1:06:27] we're not into smoke and drinking and
[1:06:28] carrying on again because something
[1:06:29] happened and within us to receive the
[1:06:31] gospel to receive the good news that we
[1:06:34] don't have to live the way we live
[1:06:36] isn't that right now this only amplified
[1:06:39] that's what we just read galatians 3 1-3
[1:06:41] it says oh you poor and silly and
[1:06:43] thoughtless and unreflecting senseless
[1:06:45] galatians who was fascinated or
[1:06:48] bewitched or cast a spell over you of
[1:06:50] whom right before your very eyes jesus
[1:06:52] christ the messiah was openly and
[1:06:54] graphically set forth and portrayed as
[1:06:56] crucified let me ask you this one
[1:06:58] question did you receive the holy spirit
[1:07:00] as a result of obeying the law and doing
[1:07:02] this works
[1:07:03] or was it by hearing the message of the
[1:07:05] gospel and believing it was it from
[1:07:07] observing a law of rituals or from a
[1:07:10] message of faith are you so foolish and
[1:07:12] so senseless and so silly having begun
[1:07:15] your new life spiritually with the holy
[1:07:17] spirit are you now reaching perfection
[1:07:20] by dependence on the flesh
[1:07:24] oh hallelujah this is challenging
[1:07:26] tonight i'm telling you
[1:07:29] oh gloria this is going to roughen some
[1:07:31] feathers tonight
[1:07:32] please go the illegalistic government a
[1:07:34] lot of fight they will have a recess
[1:07:35] thing tonight because you're talking
[1:07:37] about faith here now and trust and
[1:07:39] confidence in god
[1:07:40] that has called you by his grace
[1:07:42] okay
[1:07:44] galatians 3. oh we're running some
[1:07:45] scriptures you're almost like a bible
[1:07:46] study this time
[1:07:47] i'll be running here all right run with
[1:07:49] me galatians 3 from verse 10 for as many
[1:07:52] as of the works of the lord under the
[1:07:54] curse
[1:07:55] for this written curses every one that
[1:07:57] continues not in all things which are
[1:07:59] written in the book of the law to do
[1:08:01] them
[1:08:02] but that no man is justified by the law
[1:08:05] in the sight of god it is evident for
[1:08:07] the josh
[1:08:09] live
[1:08:10] by faith
[1:08:12] and i was looted a message
[1:08:13] oh
[1:08:15] so luther who was trying to say hailey
[1:08:18] mary and starting to do penance and
[1:08:20] kneel down and and and work himself up
[1:08:23] the justification one day luther
[1:08:25] stumbled upon a big bible and when he
[1:08:27] read the just after kneeling all them
[1:08:30] steps because the pope said if you
[1:08:32] caught these steps on your knees for 500
[1:08:34] steps you're going to get justified and
[1:08:36] he poor fella he climbing up the steps
[1:08:37] and when he finished war up there he's
[1:08:39] still not justified but when he hit that
[1:08:41] word and said the just shall live by
[1:08:43] faith you are justified by faith luther
[1:08:47] got a revelation and shook up the whole
[1:08:49] roman catholic empire by a revelation of
[1:08:52] justification which come only by faith
[1:08:55] or give the lord some praises praise so
[1:08:58] if god justified by faith how could we
[1:09:00] get justification by the law
[1:09:03] that's not working
[1:09:05] and the law is not of faith
[1:09:08] the man that do with them shall live by
[1:09:09] them
[1:09:10] christ
[1:09:11] has redeemed us from the curse of the
[1:09:14] law being made a curse for us for his
[1:09:16] written curses everyone that hung out in
[1:09:18] a tree that the blessing oh this is this
[1:09:20] is the scripture that hit me that the
[1:09:22] blessing of abram might come on the
[1:09:25] gentiles through jesus christ that we
[1:09:27] might receive the promise
[1:09:30] of the spirit through faith
[1:09:33] oh give the lord if this don't make you
[1:09:34] shout tonight i don't know what will the
[1:09:36] promise of the spirit is whole
[1:09:38] say it again
[1:09:40] true faith is the promise of the spirit
[1:09:42] the promise is unto you and to your
[1:09:44] children and to them that are far off
[1:09:46] even as many as the lord our god shall
[1:09:49] call you shall receive power after the
[1:09:52] holy ghost is come upon you that's the
[1:09:54] promise praise god and you receive that
[1:09:56] promise through faith
[1:09:58] oh glory to god right now tonight you
[1:10:00] are under a promise
[1:10:02] what promised a promise of god he
[1:10:04] breathed upon them receiving the holy
[1:10:06] ghost it was a promise hanging over them
[1:10:09] oh glory to god hallelujah and what did
[1:10:11] the prophet say when the church has
[1:10:12] grown in that the holy ghost is just as
[1:10:15] real the damn as it was only a pentecost
[1:10:18] oh glory to god there will be a bunch of

[1:12:22] don't care how they tap in the devils
[1:12:24] right now
[1:12:25] oh my hallelujah
[1:12:28] go with god
[1:12:30] romans 6
[1:12:32] verse 14 says for sin
[1:12:34] shall not have dominion over you
[1:12:36] for you are not under the law
[1:12:38] but under grace
[1:12:40] you say what then shall we sin because
[1:12:42] we are not under the law
[1:12:44] but on the grace you say god forbid
[1:12:46] no you not that to whom you heal
[1:12:48] yourself civil to be his servants you
[1:12:50] are to whom you will be whether sin unto
[1:12:53] death or obedience unto righteousness
[1:12:55] but god be tanked that we were servants
[1:12:58] of sin but we have obeyed here we go
[1:13:00] from the heart
[1:13:02] that form of doctrine
[1:13:04] which was delivered to you
[1:13:06] being then made free from sin you become
[1:13:09] servant of righteousness
[1:13:11] hallelujah
[1:13:12] i speak
[1:13:14] after the manner of men because of the
[1:13:16] infirmity of your flesh for ye have
[1:13:18] yielded your member servants to
[1:13:19] uncleanness and to iniquity unto
[1:13:21] iniquity even so now in your members
[1:13:25] servants to righteousness
[1:13:26] unto holiness for when you were servants
[1:13:29] of sin you were free from righteousness
[1:13:31] what fruit had you done and those things
[1:13:33] wherever you now will be ashamed for the
[1:13:35] end of those things is death but now
[1:13:38] being made free from sin we become
[1:13:40] servants to god
[1:13:42] you have your fruit unto holiness and
[1:13:44] end everlasting life for the wishes of
[1:13:46] sin
[1:13:48] is death but the gift of god is eternal
[1:13:50] life true
[1:13:51] jesus christ
[1:13:53] our lord
[1:13:54] oh my
[1:13:55] so what do you want
[1:13:58] do this
[1:13:59] a law
[1:14:00] there are some people love
[1:14:02] legalism they love legal
[1:14:04] ministers they love the law cracking on
[1:14:06] their back because they want
[1:14:07] righteousness and
[1:14:09] it's not internalized and they want
[1:14:10] somebody to help them with it so they
[1:14:12] crack whip of the lure
[1:14:14] you know and make them line up and
[1:14:16] things like that but then romans 8 14
[1:14:19] give us the key here for as many as are
[1:14:22] led
[1:14:23] by the spirit of god they are
[1:14:27] the sons of god so we have law word
[1:14:30] and and rules and being led by
[1:14:34] the spirit now god wants each one of us
[1:14:36] to be led by his spirit and his spirit
[1:14:38] wouldn't lead you contrary to the word
[1:14:40] praise god because the word and the
[1:14:42] spirit is one so when you say led by the
[1:14:44] spirit doesn't mean some ghost some kind
[1:14:46] of thing then you contrary praise god
[1:14:48] the spirit of the word but did you buy
[1:14:50] the word it wouldn't be out of the world
[1:14:52] isn't that right so romans 8 14 says for
[1:14:55] by for as many as led by the spirit of
[1:14:57] god they are the sons of god
[1:14:58] and galatians 5 18 says but if you be
[1:15:01] led by the spirit you are not under the
[1:15:02] law
[1:15:06] so those that are not by the spirit on
[1:15:07] the rules
[1:15:08] and regulations and we know how to obey
[1:15:11] this and do this but those that are led
[1:15:13] by the spirit they are not
[1:15:16] under the law
[1:15:18] so a clock without action you can't tell
[1:15:21] the time
[1:15:22] you ever see a dead clock
[1:15:24] you tell any time or twice a day right
[1:15:27] it just stopped there
[1:15:30] for the clock to tell the time something
[1:15:32] had to move
[1:15:33] something else did on the inside isn't
[1:15:35] that right you always have to have some
[1:15:37] action
[1:15:38] oh praise god but
[1:15:41] then we find again that when this man
[1:15:43] saw the first thing you know he got
[1:15:46] great then stuck out his chest certainly
[1:15:49] we built this thing we've done this and
[1:15:51] when he done it
[1:15:53] then he got to a place
[1:15:55] he didn't want samuel's advice anymore
[1:15:59] he done it the way he wanted to do it
[1:16:02] and that is what happened today
[1:16:04] the people has got to a place
[1:16:07] that they don't want to do it the way
[1:16:09] god wants to do it
[1:16:11] they want to do it the way they want to
[1:16:13] do it and that's the matter today god
[1:16:16] wants divine healing amongst his people
[1:16:19] the big high fellow said no wait a
[1:16:20] minute these are miracles is is past
[1:16:24] no no they don't say that no
[1:16:26] you just say push at that side like
[1:16:28] pentecostal let me bring some mysteries
[1:16:31] that are you saying spiritual these are
[1:16:33] miracles is past because all is the word
[1:16:35] mysteries is your word miracles is the
[1:16:37] word i know people think but euro
[1:16:40] doesn't like the mysteries i hear too in
[1:16:41] love with the mysteries but christ is
[1:16:43] the mystery
[1:16:44] and i am a mystery oh anger like the
[1:16:45] mystery
[1:16:46] christ is the mystery of god revealed so
[1:16:49] it's not a matter of not liking
[1:16:50] mysteries it's a matter of what they're
[1:16:52] emphasizing and what they're leaving out
[1:16:54] sometimes it's not what they're saying
[1:16:55] is what they leave out
[1:16:57] that is dangerous
[1:16:58] because there are sick saints that need
[1:17:00] healing
[1:17:01] and the only way we can have it is if we
[1:17:03] put our foot in it
[1:17:05] god tell joshua every place you put your
[1:17:07] foot is yours
[1:17:08] we are born with these gifts we are born
[1:17:10] with this fate as we say you're not born
[1:17:12] a soldier you have become a soldier
[1:17:15] you see a slacker on the street and they
[1:17:17] put them in the army all of a sudden you
[1:17:18] see their shoulders straight back and
[1:17:20] they walk in they reckon upright and
[1:17:22] they could hold a gun and they could go
[1:17:23] and fight because they have been trained
[1:17:25] to do that well god comes calls on
[1:17:27] people in this last days to take them
[1:17:29] aside and train them and shoulder them
[1:17:31] and give them corn and ripple of warfare
[1:17:33] to fight the enemy with everything you
[1:17:36] got
[1:17:36] whatever you've got to use you use it
[1:17:39] you have a song sing it you have a voice
[1:17:41] preach it whatever you're going to do do
[1:17:42] it oh give the lord some praises
[1:17:44] hallelujah
[1:17:46] watch
[1:17:47] god wants divine healing among his
[1:17:48] people who wants that
[1:17:50] he does not really believe it right
[1:17:52] god too
[1:17:54] so i on his side
[1:17:55] he warns
[1:17:57] divine healing
[1:17:58] among his people
[1:18:00] now what caused saul to do that here we
[1:18:02] go
[1:18:02] when he got to a place that he took over
[1:18:04] the leading of the people
[1:18:07] instead of letting the holy spirit
[1:18:10] how much pastors take over
[1:18:13] is there no holy spirit leader
[1:18:15] and then they won't touch the idea that
[1:18:17] they're in it
[1:18:18] and the leading people show
[1:18:20] and satan is a big director behind them
[1:18:25] because by the fruit you'll know
[1:18:27] if you're leaving people to hate malice
[1:18:29] evil
[1:18:30] separation no brotherly love no
[1:18:33] fellowship you know that the devil
[1:18:35] i don't care who behind it i don't care
[1:18:37] what they say it's lucifer himself
[1:18:40] conducting behind the conductor
[1:18:43] because god pushing for fate
[1:18:46] unity pillar fire power
[1:18:48] praise god manifested sons adopted sons
[1:18:51] praised sons character got pushing for
[1:18:54] that praise god hallelujah what we're
[1:18:56] pushing for now watch
[1:18:58] what caused you all to do that when he
[1:19:00] got to a place see no he didn't start
[1:19:02] like that
[1:19:03] he started left by the spirit
[1:19:05] god told simon anoint him the one king
[1:19:08] gave him king
[1:19:09] but he was called by god led in the
[1:19:11] right position to be placed as king over
[1:19:14] israel so he started in the spirit start
[1:19:16] off anointed but watch what happened
[1:19:18] here when he got to a place when he took
[1:19:20] over the leading of the people instead
[1:19:23] of letting the holy spirit know samuel
[1:19:25] told him he said now if you go ahead and
[1:19:27] have your king
[1:19:29] you only live right and keep god's
[1:19:30] commandments and do what the lord says
[1:19:32] follow the spirit saul will be able to
[1:19:34] preach some mighty good messages
[1:19:37] and he did
[1:19:38] they had no right to disbelieve samuel
[1:19:40] because samuel always prophesied the
[1:19:41] truth to them he told them what truth
[1:19:44] but he said now if you will just let
[1:19:46] saul and all of you follow the leadings
[1:19:48] of the spirit keep the commandments of
[1:19:50] the lord everything will be all right
[1:19:53] if that taking place tonight in every
[1:19:55] church in the united states there will
[1:19:57] be a revival start in this nation i will
[1:19:59] tell you whiskey joints would be broke
[1:20:01] up it would be one of the grandest thing
[1:20:03] this nation ever know if every preacher
[1:20:06] of all the nomination would just follow
[1:20:08] the leading of the holy spirit instead
[1:20:11] of some creed or some denomination or
[1:20:13] some bishop said or somebody shell said
[1:20:17] or somebody said what somebody else said
[1:20:19] has nothing to do with it god sent the
[1:20:23] holy spirit and he is our guide he is
[1:20:26] our leader and when oh glory to god not
[1:20:29] some bishop not some man in america some
[1:20:32] special message pope praise god so man
[1:20:34] praise god and jeff or wherever god said
[1:20:36] no man has no leader god sent the holy
[1:20:39] spirit or give the lord some praises
[1:20:41] hallelujah god send the holy spirit as
[1:20:44] the leader oh close and as men are led
[1:20:46] by the spirit of god oh god they are the
[1:20:49] sons of god god let us on sunday god
[1:20:51] leading us tonight god will lead us next
[1:20:53] sunday and wednesday or whatever as god
[1:20:56] leads us we want to follow that leading
[1:20:58] and if we are led by the spirit it will
[1:21:00] be vindicated oh glory to god let me say
[1:21:02] that again it will be vindicated it will
[1:21:05] be confirmed that is the leading of the
[1:21:07] holy spirit is what god once spoken
[1:21:10] oh blessed be name of the lord so god
[1:21:13] sent the holy spirit and he is our guide
[1:21:15] he is our leader but when even the holy
[1:21:18] spirit move in watch so but when
[1:21:21] they even see here we go the holy spirit
[1:21:25] moving they get scared of it
[1:21:27] they don't know what it is
[1:21:29] i remember that convention years ago in
[1:21:30] trinidad when the spirit i think i kind
[1:21:32] of was preaching when the spirit began
[1:21:34] to move i better come behind and talk
[1:21:36] about he don't know that quality of
[1:21:37] spirit
[1:21:39] but joy is not talking about
[1:21:42] man it was strange to them
[1:21:44] they know nothing about the movement of
[1:21:46] the spirit they know nothing about the
[1:21:49] operation of the spirit all they know is
[1:21:51] word
[1:21:53] word
[1:21:53] they're bringing forth word and the
[1:21:55] spirit can't move at all they're buying
[1:21:57] we've got buying with chains of
[1:21:59] circumstance buying the spirit of
[1:22:01] unbelief the spirit can't move because
[1:22:03] where the spirit of the lord is i think
[1:22:05] there is supposed to be liberty it's not
[1:22:07] right brother where the spirit of the
[1:22:09] lord is there is
[1:22:10] shout out liberty
[1:22:12] shout out to liberty again
[1:22:14] where the spirit is there is liberty you
[1:22:16] have the freedom to worship freedom the
[1:22:17] praise god freedom to take your
[1:22:19] atmosphere freedom my god there is
[1:22:22] liberty where the spirit of god is
[1:22:26] oh glory to god so watch
[1:22:28] so when the scene even the holy spirit
[1:22:30] moves in they get scared of it they
[1:22:32] don't know what it is one it's a
[1:22:34] stranger to them because they are not
[1:22:36] taught in that line
[1:22:38] gathered by clients they are not taught
[1:22:40] in that line
[1:22:41] so they don't know that spirit line
[1:22:44] i could identify the spirit line in the
[1:22:45] message and the intellectual line i
[1:22:47] could identify the quotes that the
[1:22:49] intellectual will take and the tools
[1:22:51] that the spirit line will take i said
[1:22:53] openly already i am on the spirit line
[1:22:56] so you'll find me on a certain track
[1:22:58] that is where i'm going to run on they
[1:23:00] have an intellectual line you have a
[1:23:01] spirit line brought any message both are
[1:23:04] believers both are anointed both are
[1:23:06] ministers but one on an intellectual
[1:23:08] track and one on our spirit line track
[1:23:10] praise god i could tell you to your face
[1:23:12] i'm on the spirit line track i am moving
[1:23:15] praise god over to the intellectual
[1:23:17] track oh glory to god in every quote
[1:23:19] they say we can say amen to earth oh
[1:23:21] glory hallelujah because the quote they
[1:23:24] quoting is the word but praise god but
[1:23:26] we are still staying on the spirit line
[1:23:28] track
[1:23:29] oh glory god took the prophet but didn't
[1:23:31] take the angel god took the prophet but
[1:23:33] didn't take the holy ghost god took the
[1:23:34] prophet but didn't take praise god the
[1:23:36] manifestation that he prophesied that is
[1:23:38] to come and we are witnesses that this
[1:23:40] is that that the prophet william branham
[1:23:42] speak of oh glory to god hallelujah let
[1:23:46] me see if i could hit the home stretch
[1:23:47] here now it's as strange as them because
[1:23:49] they're not taught in that line they are
[1:23:51] taught just on certain things that the
[1:23:53] church believes and they go on right
[1:23:56] like that they go through life callings
[1:23:58] of christians and go on with the things
[1:23:59] of the world and when they come to die
[1:24:01] they say my faith saves me
[1:24:04] and they come to die hallelujah then he
[1:24:06] said this i said to a man some time ago
[1:24:07] i said sir didn't the lord ever condemn
[1:24:10] you for that smoking he said oh he said
[1:24:12] no
[1:24:13] i said i have seen you drink myself he
[1:24:16] said look here preacher i want to tell
[1:24:17] you something
[1:24:19] i visit another man in a room he said my
[1:24:21] faith saves me
[1:24:24] nobody gets into the topic
[1:24:27] works must follow faith
[1:24:32] he said my faith says me i said but
[1:24:34] mister let me tell you something now
[1:24:37] faith
[1:24:38] without works
[1:24:40] is dead
[1:24:42] i said the holy spirit don't live a life
[1:24:44] like that see i said you may be
[1:24:46] disappointed i said no the fate is all
[1:24:49] right but if the works don't follow the
[1:24:51] faith
[1:24:53] then the fate is no good
[1:24:57] if the works don't follow
[1:24:59] the faith you know how i say we just say
[1:25:02] must be born again
[1:25:04] works
[1:25:05] must
[1:25:08] follow faith
[1:25:09] it's not a
[1:25:10] suggestion it must
[1:25:13] now we
[1:25:15] the children of abraham not as exact was
[1:25:17] but his royal sea to christ jesus
[1:25:20] by the faith he had
[1:25:21] abraham she'd come and fought in the
[1:25:23] last days to shine like the stars almost
[1:25:25] done
[1:25:26] abram's children
[1:25:28] considering not his own body now dead
[1:25:30] neither even considered it it wasn't
[1:25:32] even brought into question whether god
[1:25:34] would do it or not god said he would do
[1:25:36] it why why it was revealed to him
[1:25:41] when it's revealed to you
[1:25:44] you can't make it happen
[1:25:46] it's got to be revealed to you
[1:25:50] so when it's revealed to you you don't
[1:25:52] even consider else impossible you don't
[1:25:55] consider what the doctor said you don't
[1:25:57] consider what mama said what the
[1:25:59] preacher said what anybody said you only
[1:26:01] consider what god said because it's a
[1:26:04] revelation and revelation is faith or
[1:26:07] give the lord some praises
[1:26:10] [Applause]
[1:26:11] if it's not revealed
[1:26:13] and you're claiming it by faith that's a
[1:26:15] different thing
[1:26:18] are you expecting god to do this and
[1:26:19] expecting god to do that but you don't
[1:26:21] have a revelation of that
[1:26:23] so when god doesn't do it you get
[1:26:24] disappointed
[1:26:26] and you've expected god your vex with

[1:27:11] but was strong in
[1:27:13] strong in
[1:27:15] faith which was a revelation
[1:27:17] he wasn't taking it by faith he had a
[1:27:19] revelation that isaac was coming

[1:27:56] syria's whom
[1:27:57] it wasn't even brought under
[1:27:58] consideration he didn't have a second
[1:28:01] thought but if she all she did that that
[1:28:03] then listen the promise was so exciting
[1:28:05] to him that he didn't even say that dead
[1:28:07] boom didn't contain consideration no no
[1:28:09] consideration whatsoever right like that
[1:28:11] like insult to tell him about sarah

[1:28:35] the lad be going up and and then i'll be

[1:28:52] resize that from the dead
[1:28:54] oh he had confidence if isaac died god
[1:28:57] could raise him from the dead because
[1:28:59] this was the child of promise or give
[1:29:01] the lord some praises that's when you
[1:29:03] get a divine revelation nothing stops
[1:29:05] you oh glory to god and revelation is
[1:29:07] sovereign revelation comes from god no
[1:29:10] man can give you revelation religion

[1:29:29] hallelujah
[1:29:31] hallelujah
[1:29:33] let's go
[1:29:35] if you was led by the spirit and all
[1:29:39] sons and daughters of god are led by the
[1:29:41] spirit of god
[1:29:42] they move by the spirit
[1:29:44] odd strange they stay right every action
[1:29:46] is with the bible
[1:29:48] all their doctrine stays right with the
[1:29:50] bible they don't vary on one thing where
[1:29:53] the bible say it they will move right on
[1:29:55] it
[1:29:55] if they stop for a minute they are
[1:29:57] trying to study and see which way to
[1:29:59] make then the holy spirit reveals it and
[1:30:02] he moves right on and he does the same
[1:30:04] thing follow the same rules lay the same
[1:30:06] foundation the same god comes upon him
[1:30:08] the same wonders the same miracles the
[1:30:10] same signs follow him that follow him he
[1:30:12] said if you can't believe me jesus
[1:30:15] being a man
[1:30:17] jesus said this believe the works that i
[1:30:19] do
[1:30:22] jesus is bringing a testimony of his
[1:30:24] father and his kingdom preaching the
[1:30:26] kingdom he said okay if you don't
[1:30:28] believe me
[1:30:29] take the word check the works out
[1:30:30] all right
[1:30:31] believe me if i do not the works of my
[1:30:33] father then don't believe me
[1:30:35] there is works
[1:30:37] goals but this faith
[1:30:40] show me your works by without your faith
[1:30:43] and i will show you my works by my faith
[1:30:46] said paul paul said that
[1:30:50] oh glory to god hallelujah hallelujah
[1:30:54] praise god praise god oh let me say wrap
[1:30:56] up here now
[1:30:58] who
[1:31:00] romans 8 3 and 4. for what the law could
[1:31:03] not do
[1:31:04] and that it was weak to the flesh
[1:31:07] god sending his own son in the likeness
[1:31:09] of sinful flesh and for sin condemn sin
[1:31:12] in the flesh
[1:31:14] what's the purpose
[1:31:15] next verse explain the purpose
[1:31:17] that
[1:31:19] the righteousness of the law
[1:31:22] might be fulfilled in us
[1:31:24] who walk
[1:31:26] not after the flesh
[1:31:28] but after the spirit so the sin had to
[1:31:31] be condemned that the rashes of the law
[1:31:34] could be fulfilled
[1:31:35] because the law couldn't produce
[1:31:36] righteousness by keeping the law
[1:31:38] but the law had righteousness in it
[1:31:41] oh glory to god
[1:31:42] and what is the righteousness of the
[1:31:44] lord then
[1:31:45] let's hear matthew 22
[1:31:48] verse 35.
[1:31:49] then one of them which was a lawyer
[1:31:52] a lawyer
[1:31:53] asked him a question this is talking to
[1:31:55] jesus tempting him and saying master
[1:31:58] which is the great commandment in the
[1:32:00] law
[1:32:01] there's a question that this lawyer
[1:32:03] presented to jesus
[1:32:05] and jesus said unto him though shall
[1:32:07] love the lord thy god with all thy heart
[1:32:09] with all thy soul
[1:32:11] with all thy mind
[1:32:13] this is the first
[1:32:15] and great commandment
[1:32:17] and the second is like unto it
[1:32:20] thou shalt love thy neighbor
[1:32:22] as thyself
[1:32:24] and then jesus made this notable
[1:32:26] statement in verse 40.
[1:32:28] on these
[1:32:29] two commandments
[1:32:32] hang
[1:32:33] all the law
[1:32:35] and prophets
[1:32:38] on these two what's the two love god
[1:32:42] with all my heart mind and soul and love
[1:32:44] your neighbor as yourself
[1:32:46] everything else hanging on that
[1:32:48] praise god
[1:32:50] you're almost finished
[1:32:51] okay so i'll tell you where we are we're
[1:32:53] in page 13 and i have 15 pages
[1:32:55] surface two more pictures all right
[1:32:57] romans 13
[1:32:59] verse 8 oh no man anything
[1:33:02] but to love one another
[1:33:04] for he that loved it
[1:33:06] another
[1:33:07] had fulfilled
[1:33:09] the law
[1:33:12] for this
[1:33:13] he's continuing those shall not commit
[1:33:15] adultery those shall not kill those
[1:33:16] shall not steal those shall not be a
[1:33:18] false witness though shall not covet if
[1:33:20] there be any other commandment
[1:33:23] it is briefly comprehended in this
[1:33:26] saying namely thou shalt love thy
[1:33:28] neighbor as thyself
[1:33:31] love
[1:33:32] worketh no ill to his neighbor
[1:33:35] therefore love is the fulfilling of the
[1:33:37] law
[1:33:40] so the law be it fulfills that with a
[1:33:42] hard face
[1:33:43] and a big
[1:33:45] belt
[1:33:46] and a big whip
[1:33:47] but love
[1:33:48] is the fulfilling of the law
[1:33:51] galatians 5
[1:33:53] 13-14
[1:33:54] for brethren
[1:33:56] you have been called unto liberty
[1:33:58] only use not the liberty for an occasion
[1:34:01] to the flesh but by love
[1:34:03] serve one another
[1:34:05] for all the law is fulfilled in one word
[1:34:09] even this
[1:34:10] that thou shalt
[1:34:12] love thy neighbor
[1:34:13] as thyself
[1:34:15] all the law is fulfilled one word hello
[1:34:17] v
[1:34:18] love thy neighbor
[1:34:19] as thyself
[1:34:21] galatians 5 6
[1:34:23] and we read that as the text for in
[1:34:25] jesus christ neither circumcision a
[1:34:27] villain anything nor uncircumcision but
[1:34:30] fate
[1:34:31] which worketh by love
[1:34:33] so faith worked by love and james said
[1:34:37] faith without works is dead so we
[1:34:39] conclude that seventh and fate
[1:34:42] without love
[1:34:43] is dead
[1:34:48] with all the faith and no love it's a
[1:34:50] dead fate
[1:34:52] when you're talking
[1:34:53] oh hallelujah hallelujah go begin the
[1:34:59] first lord 1
[1:35:00] 5 and 6. now
[1:35:03] the end of the commandment is charity
[1:35:06] out of a pure heart
[1:35:07] and of a good conscience and a fake
[1:35:10] unfield
[1:35:11] from which some have swerved having
[1:35:14] turned aside onto vane jungling
[1:35:16] that's really amplified
[1:35:18] whereas the object and purpose of our
[1:35:22] instruction and charge is love
[1:35:24] which springs from a pure heart
[1:35:27] a good clear conscience sincere on fake
[1:35:29] faith
[1:35:30] but certain individuals have missed the
[1:35:33] mark on this very matter and have
[1:35:35] wandered away intervene arguments
[1:35:38] and discussions
[1:35:40] and purposeless talk
[1:35:43] so when you get away from love
[1:35:45] it's discussions
[1:35:46] arguments
[1:35:48] and purposeless talk
[1:35:50] okay
[1:35:51] almost true
[1:35:52] mission comma please
[1:35:54] oh blessed be with the lord could you
[1:35:56] take a little more
[1:35:57] james two are we coming to the close 15
[1:36:00] to 18.
[1:36:01] if a brother or sister be naked
[1:36:04] and destitute of daily food
[1:36:06] and one of you say unto them depart in
[1:36:08] peace
[1:36:09] be warmed and filled you know people are
[1:36:12] they speak in a wood
[1:36:13] be warmed and filled notwithstanding you
[1:36:15] give them those things which are needful
[1:36:17] to the body what knotted prophet
[1:36:20] even so faith
[1:36:21] if it heart not works is dead
[1:36:24] being alone yet a man may say thou has
[1:36:27] faith and i have works show me thy faith
[1:36:29] without thy works and i will show you my
[1:36:32] faith by my works
[1:36:34] but abraham said this here god leads his
[1:36:37] people through great trials to punch
[1:36:38] them
[1:36:39] sometimes it takes years to do it
[1:36:41] as for me myself i believe
[1:36:44] that right now god is training such men
[1:36:47] to meet the front line
[1:36:49] men who are going through and time shook
[1:36:51] from their feet sometimes it looked like
[1:36:53] the whole thing is falling yet in the
[1:36:55] midst of all of it they know that living
[1:36:57] god and keep their face forward and keep
[1:36:59] moving on this is the part i want to get
[1:37:01] as we wrap up here
[1:37:04] and many people
[1:37:07] praying for revival begin to pray
[1:37:08] something
[1:37:09] i wonder if sometimes if those who are
[1:37:12] praying
[1:37:13] if their own prayer don't stop up the
[1:37:14] wells of blessings
[1:37:16] when they are are you ready
[1:37:19] cowardly
[1:37:20] and afraid to trust god
[1:37:23] and afraid to take him at his word
[1:37:26] after you pray
[1:37:27] you have to act
[1:37:29] works
[1:37:30] must follow faith
[1:37:32] let us stand and begin the praise god
[1:37:33] tonight
[1:37:35] oh blessed be the name of the lord
[1:37:37] works
[1:37:39] must it's not a recommendation
[1:37:41] if you're not seeing any worth behind
[1:37:42] faith is not faith at all
[1:37:44] that's the bottom line
[1:37:46] if there is no action behind your
[1:37:47] confession of what you believe
[1:37:50] you don't believe it
[1:37:51] if you really believe
[1:37:53] you're going to act upon it
[1:37:54] let's pray father god we thank you for
[1:37:56] your presence lord and i pray that your
[1:37:58] anointing will come and bring divine
[1:38:00] revelation to your people of your grace

[1:38:06] and the works to follow that faith bless
