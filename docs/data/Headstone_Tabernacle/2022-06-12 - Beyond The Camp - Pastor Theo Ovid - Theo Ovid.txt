this morning thanks but anthony for that inspiring praise god mini song ministry amen praise the lord amen it's good to be the host of god good to see all of you all this morning it's good to be in the presence of god we already we are already refreshed so we want to turn our bibles to hebrews chapter 13. we just have verse 10 to 14 just one scripture this morning hebrews 13 reading from verse 10 to 14 and reads we have an altar whereof they have no right to eat which serve the tabernacle for the bodies of those beasts whose blood is brought into the sanctuary by the high priest for sin are burned without the camp wherefore jesus also that he might sanctify the people with his own blood suffered without the gate let us go forth therefore unto him without the camp bearing his repulse may god bless his word you may be seated and this last verse in verse 13 tell us where jesus is at let us go forth therefore unto him without the camp in other words beyond where the people are be when the others are he is outside be on the camp right now he is outside knocking trying to get in he's outside the camps religious camps and i'm a national camps amen our title this morning beyond the camp that's the title i have be on the camp i'd have an inspiration to go go in and go on leave my song strange but the goal is an intent if you intend to go beyond the camp either you go in you intend to go or you have gone but we are called to go beyond the camp all blessed be the name of the lord but abraham is heaven is perfect or how are you going to be when you're continually sinning when you are continually doing what's wrong now this will kind of put a kink in the legalistic but notice it isn't what you do it is what god has done amen it is not what you do it's what he has done you can't be perfect you can't be in yourself but in christ you are perfected you are not trusting in your own good works or your own church you belong to but you are trusting in the shed blood of the lord jesus there you are that is what makes you perfect that is what anchors your feet oh blessed be the name of the lord that is what makes you perfect that is what anchors your faith but around praying here he said okay heavenly father as we view back this morning with our minds back down there some hundreds of years ago where there's still jehoshaphat standing there by the side of kingihab a little spirit dung in his heart still left of god though he had made a mistake told him this is wrong this is wrong it's not clean it's not holy the prophet has said these things couldn't go on like this and a little fire woke him up and when then you had somebody to answer that little fire was mikaya a true prophet and though he might have come dressed in rags though he might have come up there despised all of them looking upon him as if a bunch of wolves looking at the lamb but he told the truth though he had been smitten in the face though he had to be thrown into prison and fed water and bread of sorrow yet the words that he said come to pass for you was with him god grant today as we look down in the bible we look at church books decalogues and so forth churches rituals and we shall see follow peace and holiness without which no man shall see the lord he that loves the world or changes the world the love of god is not in him in the last days perilous times shall come men shall be lovers of their own self proud boosters and great and those things happening heady high-minded lovers of pleasure more than lovers of god teaching people precepts of men instead of the commandments of god having a form of godliness and denying the power of the holy ghost to make a man filled with the spirit to make him rejoice make a man filled with the spirit to make a man rejoice oh glory to god hallelujah this bible said the joy of the lord is my strength and your question is are you happy you know you see christians today and you wonder is people happy they go to church but are you happy could you rejoice in the lord the bible said rejoice ever maury rejoice in the lord isn't that right rejoice i may make a man filled with the spirit to make tears flew down from his eyes to make him go back and pray for the sick to make him speak with tongues and interpret to make him prophesy the spirit of god the living god they just took it off of some lunch or something like that having a form of godliness but denying the power of oh god made this little audience on this day wake up quickly right now before the end time come and catch us in this condition may we renew ourselves as the bible said rise and shake yourself and ask for the old way which is the good way and when you find it walk in it god grant that we can find the old rugged way where we could stand together again and join hand and sing i'll take the way with the lord despite you i've started with jesus and i'm going through god help us to live that and be that bless these mothers sitting here lord knowing that they are mothers themselves white roses spin on their coats oh master of life bless them lord may they be blessed too and may their children memories be as theirs is with their mother as she's going to be on the field to the glorious heaven and some morning when life is shutting off more veins and our breath is failing to come to us the veil will open back she will come down perhaps to the inner jordan to help us over oh that glorious day when we step our feet over yonder the air will not be contaminated with cigarette smoke there will never be a drunkard on this street there will never be a prostitute there will be never no sin there'll be never nothing like that but glorious forever we will live in peace with our lord jesus and our children what a wonderful day oh father while the great darkness is on and the battle and the devil invading the countries invading the pulpits invading the churches invading the peoples invaded the businesses invading the cities and the schools and their homes oh god help us to stand and pull the sword quickly and fight for god as moses and the levites did down dear when sin was in the camp help us lord forgive us now and bless us keep us humble break us up lord god you said he that go forth sowing in tears we'll doubt this return rejoicing bring with him she's oh god break us to pieces mold us anew we are getting too much out of the way i am myself lord i'm getting to a place where i'm thinking about how many will attend my meeting oh god i want you to attend come lord jesus come break me up mull me over oh lord don't never let me get those things on my mind god keep them from me help me lord to preach are like a dying man to a dying man knowing that we must all face eternity and we have to stand before you when we are not in you pleasing manner when you are not with mercy when you are standing without mercy when you are standing angry to bring judgment upon the nations and the people has rejected and spun the love of your child god give me mercy with him today that in that day i can stand assured may you may we have to cry now you me maybe we have to cry no but you will wipe away the joy at that time when you say enter into the joy of the lord which has prepared for you from the foundation of the world god be with us now we pray and ask in jesus name what a prayer tonight oh blessed be the name of the lord to shake yourself to steal yourself to stay your spirit up you have to reject what's around you you have to reject the coldness the formality the deadness you have to reject church be church remember spirit

sin out of unbelief out of formality that the god we saved this morning hallelujah praise god amen let's continue abraham was a pilgrim and a stranger in the world his ambition was to find a city whose macan billa was god he struck something and caught god and her fate in gordon you know when something's striking striking give us something striking you know you can't explain it but sometimes strike you and you know is the lord that's why i'm the abraham something struck him oh glory he knew his god he can't experience his wife he got explained to his family but he know it's god and he's

people like wandering stars they know where they're going i don't know another kind of one you know listen to this he was a wonderful not just floating around without any purpose he found no purpose you're floating around not that kind of wondering talking about he had faith that there was a city whose build that maker was god he had a purpose in life to find that place where's your purpose in life what are you looking after what you're going after may i say here one day when the battle is over he met king of that city and given bread and wine melchizedek you can't purpose anything of god's promise in your heart without finding a reality to it there's a bomb here this morning let me say it good you cannot purpose anything of god's promise in your heart without finding a reality to it oh glory to god i knew when god called me there was a reality to it nobody could talk me out of it my whole family was catholic but nobody could convince me or talk me out of it i heard from god i heard from my tea orphanage nothing could stop me from this message oh glory to god i take it and i run with it praise god on a purpose i'm going to stand by friend or no friend family no family wife or a wife children or children praise god this thing have to live in me it has to work in me praise god minister president or no minister brethren people like you or don't like you that is the business i have nothing to do with that i am not a reactionary i'm an actionary praise god i didn't react to waters do i choose what i want to do i come here to serve god i commit to preach the word i commit to give you a word from the lord and to say out your foolishness and snatch you out from what you're in because there's a higher plane there's a higher place there's some place where you have to go you cannot stay where you are oh glory amen [Applause] let me be seated praise god [Applause] a lot of people don't want change and i know that i'm not preaching to them i'm preaching to people who want to change i know people like the self because they're all about themselves because they're under timity lovers of themselves they love the church they love god they love people they love their selfies and because of that and they get away so long with that self they don't see no need to change but you hear me pray the prophet pray break me lord move me lord don't leave me so lord don't let me think this don't let me think that oh god change me lord transform your lord you have a burden to be changed do you have a burden to be changed are you satisfied with you oh glory that's a cursion of the curse of satisfaction god always telling them something that they must present to reach hunter forgetting things that have passed i press towards the mark of the high calling you have not arrived you're present to words praise god you're young you're not getting old you're pressing the words you're depressed towards jordan either you want to go either you're going or you're gone but you have to go praise god the promise is to go to go is an intent the way the hell is favored good intention you can't just have an intent to go you have to be on your way you have to know you're going down to jordan you have to know you're going beyond the camp you have to know you're making progress oh glory to god to watch your aim attacked oh glory to god the prophet said build me up oh lord into this let christ be my foundation praise god my upon my faith and upon virtue and knowledge all these virtues let christ be my head oh glory to god amen praise god they carry respect your husband how you expect to be in christ i expect to be serving jesus christ when the world talk about how you how to be towards your husband how you have to behave towards your wife how the children have to behave towards the parents how are you going to be saving the lord and you're not you're going to contrary to what god say god is the word praise god god expect a certain behavior because you call yourself a christian you want to save the lord and god understand that and he want to help you more and you want to help yourself oh glory to god isn't that right so let me say he said no watch he said no you can't put us anything of god's promise in your heart we don't find the reality yet if your soul has been tormented by sins and doubts and ups and downs and frustration there is something wrong and you telling you there is some way you can overcome that why do you float around from church to church and from place to place just kneel down till you strike heaven you don't understand one is a majority in god praise god when you drop down on your knees and you call a god no bishop no pastor no pope nobody could stop you from tapping into heaven's blessing praise god he said if my people that's called by my name shall humble themselves and turn from their wicked ways and pray they're gonna hear from heaven you could tell god that you could hold god guilty until you bring that to pass you could tell god you said if my people i'm one of them you said if i humble myself lord i'm humbling myself if i turn from my wicked ways i turn for my wicked ways oh glory to god and i hear from heaven lord i have to hear from you because you can't lie if you said that you can't lie you've got to keep your word i've got to hear from you i've got to hear thus say the lord will give the lord a shout

purpose in life you never put person belonging to church you're a purpose and being baptized you have a purpose in what you're seeking cause we know that god is honest god is true that god can't lie and if god pleased into abraham's heart by his voice his word then god has placed in before us in his bible by the witness of the holy spirit by the returning of the holy spirit and signs and wonders that jesus still lives he'll say yesterday to him forever if you need any need whatsoever that god has promised in this bible he is here tonight to meet that need no need seeking father his presence is here his spirit is here and he is willing and ready i like that willing and ready and longing to give you what you are seeking for see first the kingdom of god and his righteousness oh god what

they walk down the street dearly as a ah remember for hundreds of years nobody see devil's cast out nobody's in healing and no deliverance 400 years all i see is tall caps nice custom made guns fully embroidered shriven pharisees twiddling the beards being respected by all saying long prayers that's what the people seeing and all of a sudden jesus trying to bring a picture to the people to expose another kingdom than this world so when he cast out devils he's showing there's a demonic kingdom behind the veil of sicknesses it have devils behind there and for the first time the world is seeing devils cast out sick being healed blind eye open before that david was playing harp to suit and get that spirit off a shawl hallelujah that was what that was god used in the old testament but in the new testament jesus was exposing the satan's kingdom come out devil hallelujah you're hiding there come out because he was seeing them oh glory to god and he anointed the church he said they were cast out demons so we have to transit we have to connect from this world to the next world we have to know that we just not flesh and blood or give the lord a shout win a spiritual war don't just sit there and look like you don't know what i'm talking about [Applause] waiting at your children in captivity your husband your wife your family his devils his demon powers influence in their lives hallelujah that people have to be broken the professor of vision of people in a prison nice people good people in a prison and he said that the dead god told him like the house of hell oh glory to god some

have to go oh hallelujah hallelujah [Applause] go to brandon you said it's right here what i've learned to see waited for the time when i walked when they walked down the street there is a crippling there from his mother's womb said van gaal having none waiting for the manifestation of the sons of god when god will make himself known so the manifestation of the sons of god is sons declaring god or sons unveiling god bringing him from the invisible to be visible oh hallelujah oh glory to god let me say it this way when they were filled by the holy ghost in the upper room and they were staggering like junk men the devils that saw that report to satan and said they carrying on updating having a good time he said and that is nothing i'm just that's that's excited you see when peter that's what says prophet said rise up and walk he said the devil get off his bed and say that is a problem we have a problem on our hand because we just killed jesus we just stopped jesus i know his disciples doing what jesus did something wrong something not right we have to stop that the authorities came down upon them put licks in there and beat them and then fellas didn't send sick leave and call and says you know i can't make a decision today you know they couldn't have irish now you know you know i have a lapova should i not see my church is that right there wasn't talking no foolishness you know no no no no no they went and said lord god may you give us strength to go back out there and preach and they say that fire power a revealing of the holy ghost come upon them strength a fresh energy a fresh baptism like it start all over again or give the lord some praises glory to god and they got refilled over again and then he said the dynamics of this church will be a refilling of the holy ghost that we work in a small measure while the headstone coming down oh glory to god we have to work with what we have god give us a sling let's use it come on give the lord a shout on that if god give you a sling let's use it use what you got oh until you get what your promise hey did you get that did you get that use what you got until you get what is promised so after this service nobody should be complaining i don't have this i do have that i don't know no complaints use what you have oh glory there are certain things i just committed in prayer my hands short i am not god and i am praying god all the holy ghost hallelujah god is god i just preached long time if you want to be friends with god still over his throne you won't play you and friends would go in your clan up and talk to saying i'm playing god don't play god he will show you who's the boss he will show you just a man yeah no god oh hallelujah where is it brett he could blow you down oh how we only standing because of him he put pressure on our bodies and that was standing this morning he gave us strength to be here this morning and we love him this morning love this message we can't afford for this message to fall to the ground recalling the devil trapped upon the message and because i'm called formal teaching teaching teaching teaching teaching praise god hallelujah after you're taught you have to manifest what you have been taught glory to god hallelujah praise god i have the teacher teachers in school they have exams coming up the exam go prove what the people having a man in here i'll never forget a time one school was working my mind was praying for the church and he said lord god bring back to those memories the things that they learn and those who haven't believed lord have mercy god can't bring back to your mind wait wait we have not learned jesus said the holy ghost will bring back to you remember things i said to you if if god spoke to you he could bring back what god said to you you have to hear the word even if you forget god could bring it back to you you know yeah i spent time you see people speaking and speaking back the word you see they don't even know how much inside of them but when they not to open them up and talk it's had to come on them out because the world is in them that's the secret the word is in the bride the devil don't believe that word turn into power but the word is and the pride and that's the key to thing going on holiday coming up the plants and corpus christi you put the seed in the ground and put peas and corn we used to plant peas and corn along that time because rain's coming right season right time everything just right to put in the seed on the ground well god have a time in season two put the seed in the ground right see is the right time because the rain is coming to fall oh glory to god it doesn't matter rain is coming the most important thing is what's seed inside of you and if the seed of the word inside of you the ring and the produce and make manifest the contents of the seed oh glory to god hallelujah do you believe that he said save angola by none waiting for the manchester sons of god when the when god will make himself known when they will stop sickness they will stop cancer they will stop diseases without a doctor's degree without 10 years or 12 years of studying i sit in a line of medicine

chloe santa stop where going stop right there a breast cancer lock him up by number throw him out or give the lord some is a demon you know it name cancer now if you're getting a fight with what we are preaching quoting this prophet would listen to this he said when a man is born in the world he become a believer he become a nazarite when he separates himself from anything that's contrary to the word a total separation jesus said i come to separate a man from his wife tear up a family he that won't take up his cross and follow me he's not worthy of me a separation from everything anything from between a community from a belief from family anything would stand between you listen anything that would stand between you and believe in the entire word of god that's the part i want to get to if your soul will not puncture every promise for this hour without amen there is something wrong somewhere you need a separation so god is not you're not going by your feelings you're going by what god said and once is the promise of god you want to say amen to that and that even means so be it oh my hallelujah praise god so noah was a fool to the intellectual world he preached he was a mother was a fool to pharaoh isn't that right all the rest of them that worked and lived for god had been considered fools they had to go beyond the camp of what they had iran where you're going like universities making buildings god you see it look like a fool but he was correct god called him out of his family out of his whole system that's what god does he called you out to give you something more they said i love my family i want to leave they hinder your own self because came out you know he tagged along his cousin his nephew lot and that was problem abraham rather abraham and then you know happened prosper because when he blessed upon you you'll hit the family too the proper so martial is that fight and then abraham take the leadership role to say listen let's not have fights be a brethren take left i take right wherever they you choose and luck pitchers tend to watch saddam he didn't see losing his wife to interpel assault he didn't see losing his children he didn't see the damage caused by his choice he has pitched into attend towards him but he ended up going and when he finished his family was gone finished by decisions he made when he pitches them towards sodom god told abraham look to the left east west north and south all is yours i couldn't tell you this but not hanging around i call you you bring your family and look entire but know that the family gone look the blessing here i break all these seals of blessing to you east west north and south is yours how many are you sitting here tonight time you need to get out you need to go beyond the camp you can't depend upon family support you know because they think you will get further and then they will hinder you look at joseph love of the father all drill highest dreams you know that is all and his brothers getting fight by words a dream last night we have a dream boy but if we're going to tell zombies no to tell them shhh but joseph gets so excited he's sharing his dreams and when they're interpreting their own mind they say we have to belong to you and this and that's not that they get fight you know what let me get rid of them that's a young brother envy jealousy in the father's house they say let me do it when he go and we go sell him out to the egyptian and sell him out and sell them and whatnot how would you feel to be joseph sold by your brothers to slave hooters and your brother will help and the brother is taking you and cometh could you record a blessing in some animal intimating like that father can't stop griefing do they bowling he shoved pushed away from his family out to the family camp into a place strange place new language new culture but the vision still holds because the vision is from god john joseph blessing was not lowered everywhere he went he was blessed hallelujah as a ghana he was blessed he got blessed so much he got promoted but if our wife and trusted him jesus said no he end up in prison he's still blessed until the time god arranged for him for the descent for joseph i don't care what prison the devil put you in a prisoner's sickness a prisoner circumstance a prisoner condition whatever it is god could ascend for you at the appointed time to give you a reward to give you a blessing based upon the faith and the predestination mystery of his will in your life hallelujah brother brown he said more and more i am made to believe that people are not getting to christ he said as i look across the nation and watch people i am fully persuaded that the people are not getting to christ and i believe that it's the enemy that throw this hindus and the reason i believe this he christ is not the object that they have been pointed to they have been born into a dogma which is like a doctrine they have been pointed to a doctrine or a party or an experience or something like that it's having points of christ the word and that is why i think that people are resting their eternal destination upon some dogma some sensation dancing in the spirit i spoke in tongues do you know you could do all these things and being personalized by the devil there's just one thing he cannot impersonate that's the word that's why in jesus he said it's the word it's written i believe today that the reason that people are not coming to christ is because they are pointed to a denomination you come and join our church you read our catechism you believe our doctrine or some system they are pointed in the wrong way and their action and the life that they live without christ proves in their own life is vindicated that's every same thing he said i know there is some reason that people are not getting to the christ it would it would they wouldn't act like that jesus here we go scripture he read suffered without the gates that he might sanctify his people with his own blood that's why he suffered that's why he went to calvary he suffered around the calvary that his blood might be released to sanctify the church because he cannot come in our filthy church you shouldn't have to be sanctified by blood because under the blood is where we have fellowship if we say we have no sin we receive ourselves and the truth is not in us but we confess our sins he is faithful and just to forgive us all sins and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness and we can have fellowship one with another with the blood of jesus christ cleanses us so under the blood is where we get the cleansing not believing the same doctrine not believing the same teaching under the blood when you recognize your same blood for you for me you will behave yourself towards me your behaviors have towards your sister or your brother because the same blood for you is for them not blood for you and no blood for them it's blood for you and blood for them is one blood he has perfected forever them that are sanctified by one blood by one offering he paid the price that we could be delivered he paid the price that we could be set free it's the price he paid not us coming to church come on now it's not the pastor it's not the church it's not the cheating is the blood christ painted with blood his blood was plus seven times through the seven ages it produced seven messengers seven messengers oh glory to god seven messages seven colors hallelujah glory they've got seven spirits seven men calling the lack of every age oh give the lord some praises that's what the messenger was sent to do to call you out to go beyond the camp give the lord a shout you brian church you have been called out [Applause] but regens is in two parts coming out of and going into it's not enough to come out you have to go into oh glory to god you have to move hallelujah you have to change campgrounds or give the lord some praises so it's more than coming out is have you gone into oh glory to god somebody said i intend to go somebody say i'm going but you have to go into it hallelujah to get to the promised land you had to pass jordan god set it up that way nature set it up that way is that one straight land it have a river to cross jordan river it's coal oh hallelujah hallelujah the intellectuals say wait till april until the river go down low and we're going to wade over jordan wade when jordan is low and joshua thanked them for their advice and counsel and he went and prayed that night and god said tell them sanctify themselves in three days we crossing over jordan is high high high but a man of god stood there and said god said in three days you are crossing over we have not been this way before prepare yourselves and the levites took up the ark and they held the act all of them over their hearts and they walking down to the jordan river oh glory they call it obeying instructions they are waiting and watching they're pushing and pressing and when their foot touched the water jordan open up oh give the lord i shout when jordan open up they say put twelve stones there or when your children ask hold them stones cut there tell them tell them let the lord open up jordan tell them the lord made a way gloria tell them glory to god glory to god and that prophet prophesy he said the world will bow at the feet of men and women who cross jordan glory of god when you cross jordan all in hittite's jebusite could be shaken all the men jericho is going to be shaken because they know god with you oh hallelujah there will no god with you your husband going to know it your children going to know it your wife's going to know it you're never going to know it your co-worker is going to know it your boss going to know it [Applause] so jesus suffered without the gates and he may s people with his own blood sanification comes from a greek word compound which means clean cleaned and set aside for service and when god cleans his people with the blood of jesus he cleans them from the filth of the world and set them aside for service oh my oh glory to god hallelujah thank you jesus thank you jesus thank you jesus on that holy month when peter saw moses elijah and jesus and peter got so excited under that inspiration and vision he got enthused he said let us build three tabernacles one for dee one for moses elijah voice shut him up and say he him this is my beloved son he him in other words he saw jesus only why i want the one built tamina some man isn't that right but i'm talking about this he said watch he said when we go beyond the camp okay i skipped it hallelujah he said in the little camp they had their peace of james and john moses and last in their camp they could see heavenly hosts pillar of light hanging and watch and as they were ready to make a denomination one for the lord one for the prophets and so forth the voice said this is my beloved son then of what they were commissioned stay with the word that is god's camp for his people god camp is what the word stay with the word that is god camp oh my he said this i'll just keep that there now when we go beyond our own song barrier into the word of god it's unlimited what god can do with a man that is ready to go beyond the camp the camp of man that is hallelujah that applies to me that apply to all of us we have to go we have to be going and we have to have the testimony we have gone beyond the camp not just intention because somebody people know cars really that you wrote to calvary and they're watching this i pass in the street because this road is dead all the times you say you can't touch me now you can't take me now might always not yet come then just switch and say my always come he settled now this is the journey now all this he'll know he's sick and cast not devils wants to bring him to this spot because all of that all these messiah signs and so on was his his purpose was to die god in service to die so all the jesus ministry he spreads upon me to anoint me to preach and multiply bread and fish all of that is to bring him to the place to die because the price had repeated to get the book with the names in it and your name was in that book somebody had to get the book so the book was in the hands of the original owner and no man could be found worthy to take that book so when the lamb himself come and die and pay the price he had access rights to the book and when he got the book he gave it to the prophet and the prophet spoke all the words and that's what caught us do you see it now this book of names that was supposed to be in adam and adam fell before he could even speak a name of the book so it fell into sex she has come and said it must be born again from the book of the word and the spirit hallelujah not go back in your mother's womb but born of the word and spirit to bring it back to your own name so you have an original name in god so you are a gene taught in god in the book so why you were baptist methodist catholic you didn't hear your name yet but when this message is preached you know something connects you with that is that your mother connect you your father connect you is the gene inside of you glory did that connect you to this thing we could just have your name in it when that mighty angel version 10 came with the book open your name was there seven thunders throw their voices out that is for the bride [Applause] that's why only the bride could connect with them thunders just remember god docket they want to talk about it they want to preach it they want to say it bible you know they think this is a new york thing you said no new york thing this is the word seventh under the voices how about the right you see it put in the taste of the voice and then what john typed the bride right i heard a voice again said quote to the angel who he's talking to one man who he's talking to go to the angel and said give me the book so the same book that man couldn't look on the same book that john wept that same book when they came on the earth you imagine the brighter access to that book now that the book is open he said go to the inside give me the book give me that book give me that word he said take it and eat it take it don't look at it take it just read it eat it digest it let it soak in you let it go tongue in you let it be part of you come on give the lord a shout in the house don't leave it on the books and tapes take it and eat it digest it it'll be sweet in your mouth in the belly because you're going to die this world will kill you if you're taken and eaten it will kill you oh glory to god hallelujah praise god you talk about satan taking the people beyond the camp of reason beyond the camp of common sense satan taking his people the other way and god is taking people the other way satan taking people away from common decency people are persuaded to their dogmas increase without the camp in the camp of dogman creed they have they have a camp put them in the camp it is a camp of education theology works doctor's degree educational personality and god is again and that camp is against god's word camp god is a camp for his people oh my in the case of abraham you know in his camp it was almost like everyday occasion that abraham met god he said three thousand years ago a man could make god anywhere it was a common thing for a man to meet god why don't they meet him today they don't it's not common for man to meet god he's considered a crazy person but ibrah meet god almost every day not only that when he went on to jira decision we find out that god was in the camp of abimelech a philistine it was a common thing i hear this here they live in the camp of his presence camp of his presence today they live in their own camp they have nothing to do with god's camp they want nothing to do with it because it's fanatically to the world people will say we are fanatics somebody calls the exercising church we need to sit up and get up because they watch just sit down and seize on the church we preach in the kingdom of god not do you witness kingdom hall you say we getting these exercises get back up and sit back down and raise your hands and praise god and worship god do we hear they do because that expresses your faith in god it's not right and more importantly it creates the atmosphere that the spirit can reveal you know what i'm saying there's a resentful spirit among the people the the spirit car reveal i'm not talking about the word coming forth now i talk about the spirit taking the word and revealing it to you because even though the word is spoken by a minister you still need the spirit to reveal it moses had to get out of the camp he had been in living in one day god invited moses into his camp he said who are you he said i am that i am that i was or will be i am present tense what was it now god thought people thought he was crazy what had he done he got out of his own camp he educated him pharaoh educated him for 40 years in a school camp and he failed it taken god another 40 years to get out of him all of his education all of his theology that he had been taught take 40 years to get out of him then god could use him god has an awful time preparing his man a natural way of doing it into a supernatural way of doing it when he got into that camp god could use him oh my if you ever leave the camp of your own reason that's the place you would find god the camp of your own reason we reasonable a lot of things we try to figure out a lot of things we try to understand a lot of things why not trust god when you don't understand when you can't explain like the man who i think he um lost his wife or he was engaged and i believe that he want to sing precious lord take my hand they say don't say lord say precious lord take my hand lead me to i am tired i'm weak his wife died and he was in the fields singing songs and specials and right there he wrote that song precious lord take my hand it's under that pain in that anguish you get these songs that are breathing in their spirits in their hearts and they're still valid today they're still anointed and inspired today because these are god inspired things and you go through stuff that nobody could explain when you cry in nighttime when you can't explain to anybody god knows you're gonna wipe away your tears you're gonna handle you isn't that right they had to change campgrounds to see the supernatural oh blessed be the name of the lord remember have you hit the home stretch when they were called to egypt god provided my prophet sacrificial lamb they had they all they had need of a word a sign a miracle a prophet to lead them they wasn't satisfied they wanted something they could do grace provided that now they wanted something to do themselves so they could make an organization and fuss and fight and stew who was going to be the high priest who would do this who would do that one day god said moses separated from them and he just swallowed them up and against inaccurate notice all these signs and wonders vindicate his presence think about it now all these people are always supernatural and they still want something that they can do and there's some people just like that they want their hand in things hang into a business hand in this hand in that hand in that mind your own business stay out of people's business m.y.o.b you don't know what miob means it means mind your own business listen to this bomb man males have a camp a camp of creed and tradition nor not god's camp of his word a camp of their own he had to leave them for he is the word he cannot stay where people are taught out of this word god cannot stay in the camp he can't he never did he must stay exactly where his word is i told some minister breton and trinidad i said i didn't come in this message for any man to preach his own message and leave out the prophet and he said i come to hear earlier i come to hear what all you think and feel about the word i comment a message that goes in a prophet we need to hear all the thoughts and ideas i said no way i ain't having it for myself and i wouldn't have it for the people that i preached to i wouldn't allow any man to come here and just preach their own thoughts last night you know while i was thinking about it i was thinking about putin so the message this morning in putin russia and water is that right when they finish they get all the texts and scripture and all kind of thing the only thing they have is some time magazine and from newsweek magazine and from cnn and what kind of stories and people's listenings and the airs and the air's doing so they're itching them to hear more because that's something fresh this song is still because i promise is that is it there is a preacher 120 years it will rain maybe maybe maybe maybe no appreciate your message it will rain light it will rain medium it'll rain heavy but it will rain and rain heavier it won't bucket that drop yeah nowhere no i preach but it will rain you push it this way that way 120 years so this morning inspiration it will be see we heard last week yeah write all three weeks hallelujah and daniel reigns had a fault thank you lord i need akka safety noah was correct hallelujah yes you're tired don't be tired don't be weary because i'm not tired and weary around since 1975 are still pumping oh glory to god because god promised certain things and i'm still looking for it after all these years i can't claim what i do have i can't lie to you i can't tell you something that's not true i have to wait till my change come oh help me jesus i will wait till my change come you must see when it come you're gonna feel it you're go sense it you're gonna experience it while pediatrics speak these words these words these words these words the holy ghost fell upon them that heard the word oh glory to god give the lord a shout hallelujah praise god what now we find out he dwell among them so watch they kick god out so then ghost had to just deal with the prophets right we find out he dwell among them his prophets he then become a stranger to them to the people so anytime they see prophet come and they trembling because they want to hear god them running their own show so that is why when is this samuel coming this is he are you calling peaceably what were they coming right now because when the prophets come they ain't coming for the knights thing you know because then people believe in terror so then prophet come here with us saying the lord so and so and they come in the kingdom you know so they set up the kings and had the parliamentary businesses and the prophet going straight to the course and what does say the law transformer rebuke them let's continue the bible said he watches over his word to confirm it he's trying to find someone it is bomb if he can just get a half-hearted man like samson yeah we call samson half-hearted it's a tough thing to even find that half-hearted sampling surrender the strength of god but give his heart to the likelihood that's the way that many of us do give something to god but not all god wants all of us isn't that right god had sent him they didn't people want to hear the message no they wouldn't hear him he prophesied he said the very god you claimed to say will destroy you and i say in the name of jesus christ the very god that this nation claims to be a religious nation the very god that they claim to save will destroy them in the iniquity he will destroy every denomination of the feast of the earth that they claim to serve notice he rebuked them and they put him out of the camp jesus suffered without the camp they put him out of the camp outside way beyond the camp put out the camp where the sacrifices are burned that is where he belong he was the sacrifice now brother sister do you know mission comma please do you know that each one of you all must sacrifice this part here people don't get the free sacrifice is only for the minister want a free pass they really want a priesthood where demands sprinkle some holy water in them tell them go go take care of them but you become the priest yourself you become part of this whole program he said now watch you must be god's sacrifice sacrifice the things of the world sacrifice your own pleasures of this world sacrifice the things of the world you know the reason that people won't do it notice out of the camp they have chosen barabbas today when the gospel was passed back and forth around the world great signs and wonders have followed revival but instead of coming in and trying to do it they are going right up with barrabas oh my here we go we are invited to go beyond that camp jesus also that he might sanctify the people with his own blood suffered without the gate let us go to him beyond the gate watch beer in his reproach what was he reproached for not because he was methodist or baptist i assure you that not because he was a pharisee or sadducee because he was the vindicated word bearing his report for what the vindicated word that's right that was what he said if i do know the works of my father don't believe me if i'm not the answer to all the scriptures questions bearing his reproach he is forever hebrews 38 bearing his name i come in my father's name bearing the reproach of the word they will be you'll be laughed at and made fun of then he said let us pray you say lord jesus we may be hated by the world but loved of the father help us cheer god help these people each one of them lord that our blessings will rest upon them let us go beyond the camp now let us go beyond our own thinking let us go by the thinking of god and the bible said this that this mind that was in christ being you let

beyond the camp tonight lord and find jesus we'll never find him by joining the church we never find him by shaking hands with some minister signing some creed or to go to some sunday school we'll only find him in the word because he is the word as we see today promise that he'll be outside the camp put out again let us go beyond the camp ready to bear his reproach hated of this world but loved
